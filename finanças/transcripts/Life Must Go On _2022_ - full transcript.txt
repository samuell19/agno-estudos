Fanling Sports Center Legend tells of a gymnasium filled with horrors. Dread permeates in its air. From 11 p.m. to 3 a.m., you can periodically hear a group of sirens roaring, screaming, and cackling like villains. Sometimes, you can even hear the pitter-patter of their shower. - What's going on? - What the heck? I'm sorry! However, the scariest noise of all is the sound of them rubbing their toes. Let me out! Help me! I also had the misfortune of stumbling into this place. Without thinking, I then met these sirens. Since then, we've become inseparable. Hi, there. Are you looking for someone? Why are you out this late? Which gang are you with? - Gang? - Yes. No. Great. You can be in mine. What? This is Midnight Gymnasium. It's open from 11 p.m. to 3 a.m. for everyone to exercise and stay cool. No membership fee and free Wi-Fi. Great deal, right? Bye. What did you do to scare them off? Forget it, Ms. Yeung. No one is going to use this crappy gymnasium anymore. Who let you smoke here? And two cigarettes? Put your cigarettes out. Okay, I'll turn off the Wi-Fi. Ms. Yeung, if you hadn't taken us into this home, we'd be worse off. Do you know what you stand for? Justice and love. I've told you a million times. No more smoking in here. - Who's smoking? - I'm not. I'm looking for Yeung, the social worker. That's me. I'm Ms. Yeung. Are you Haylen? During your suspension from school, I'll handle your case in Ms. Cheung's place. Sign here, please. Okay, but I won't sign until you're dismissed. Come and meet some new friends. Hey, let's play. The one with the blue hair is Tsang Lok-fan. You can call her Troll. The one with the bandana is Lily. The one with the barrettes is Sosad. Laney, raise your hand. The one with the "tongue" is Doofer. Next to her is Paula. I know it's hard to memorize all of them. That's fine. You'll remember once you get familiar with them. New friend, guys. She's Haylen. Fanling Youth Center Do you know what Fanling Youth Center lacks? Funding. What creates unlimited funding? One word. Marketing. Right? Okay, back to... Who is this latecomer? She's Yanki, our center's outreach social worker. This is Yung, the new colleague who studied at USC in the US. Hi. These few years, it has been hard to obtain government funds. That's why I want to reallocate our resources. Midnight Gymnasium has been around for quite some time. It has been a place for at-risk youths to waste their time, right? Not only does it waste precious resources, but it also doesn't achieve much. It's burning money. So I suggest we end Midnight Gymnasium. Look, USC. I think you got it wrong. We started Midnight Gymnasium to provide a space for young people to receive training and help from us. We're using sports to help these kids discover new possibilities. If you end it just like that, you're practically abandoning them. Yanki, I've told you many times. As social workers, we don't want our clients to stay in their comfort zones. We want them to assimilate back into society. The youth center is just a mid-way stop. The goal is to send them on their way. That's the point. Nice. What's that? French toast. How much is it? It's free. It's Yung's treat. Sorry. I'll give you a shoulder rub. Yes, please. Thank you. How is it going? With what? Your Midnight Gymnasium. No matter what, even if Midnight Gymnasium has just one client, the doors stay open. I won't lose this place. What if you do lose it? They can't lose it. They're already school-less, jobless, and loveless. Turn Lemon Into Lemonade "I'll turn lemon into lemonade." Lily, disco. What's going on? Who took my parking spot? Who? Was it you? I'm talking to you. Will you beat me if I don't respond? I don't know. It depends on my mood. That's not a parking spot. It's just an empty space. I park there, so it's my spot. I'm not moving my bike. You don't have to. I already tossed it. Beat her! - Beat her! - Beat her! How dare you hit her. Sorry. Whose side are you on? You hit my leg? Who was that? Hey, why are you guys fighting? Stop throwing balls! Please stop it, guys. Stop throwing balls! That's for hitting me! Is this why you started this program? What happened to "sports uncovering new possibilities"? Starting next week, Midnight Gymnasium will be overseen by Yung. Superintendent! They're not just throwing balls. They're practicing a new sport. A sport that involves throwing balls. Dodgeball. Dodgeball? That's right. The Hong Kong Dodgeball Cup is coming up. Our team will be competing for Fanling Youth Center. Then we can show the world why Midnight Gymnasium deserves to stay! What kind of sport is dodgeball? These girls are nothing but skin and bones. Even skin and bones can win this game. That's how new possibilities are uncovered. That's the gimmick we need. That's how we'll win hearts and minds! Superintendent. Sorry. Sorry about that. Are you okay? Three months. Three months is all you'll get. Thank you for coming to Wah Fung Secondary School's reunion dinner. Thank you to the previous president of the Alumni Association who continues to uphold our school motto. Isn't he adorable? I'm in no rush. I have eggs stored in Taipei, London, and New York. I'll give birth when I decide where to go. That's easy. I'm an emigration consultant. College graduates and professionals have better chances. Hi, nice to meet you. My name is Handsome. Do you play dodgeball? Me? Not really. It doesn't matter. Hello. It has been forever. Don't mind the smell. It's the outdoors. You guys can take a whiff. It's fresh air. I need some water. Who's that guy? Class 7B's Jones Lau. He was our class president in 8th grade. He's friends with your crush, Tony Yip. They always fought for first place during sports day. Hey, Jones! - Hello. - It has been a long time. That's right. Where did you go with that huge pack? An excursion. I was hiking and I rushed back without changing to see you all. Well, that explains the smell. It's natural, so it's harmless. - I follow you on Instagram. - Really? - Recently, you went to... - Yes. - Japan? - My second home. Yes. I ran a marathon around Mount Fuji. Do you want to see the pictures? - Sure, let's take a look. - It was a really successful run. Here, look. I have a video too. - What a view. - Come and see. There's Mount Fuji. See? It's so pretty. Take a look. Jones, it seems like you don't work. Of course I work. Who doesn't? However, I think that we should devote our lives to meaningful causes. For example, I went to rural Cambodia to help rebuild a school. I built a football pitch too. I coached the kids and brought them to a competition. There was one of the players. Her name is Phalla. She wove me this string. When she gave it to me, her eyes and her smile were so touching. Did you win the competition? Third place. Where's my phone? It's not about winning or losing. Look, they're so genuine. Their smiles supersede everything. I wonder if you know... It's time, everyone! Who will be the lucky one to win this prize - worth 328 dollars? - This one is yours. It's a multi-function air fryer. The winner is number 37! Number 37? Number 37 going once! - Number 37. It's you, Yanki! - Number 37 going twice! Jones Lau! Hi. I'd like to ask if you know how to play dodgeball. That's great. I'll get to the point then. I'm a social worker. We're putting together a dodgeball team. Since you're so fond of charity and sports and have experience in coaching, if you come to coach our team, we'll have a real shot at winning. Will you be our dodgeball coach? It sounds pretty meaningful. Thank you! You can have this. We're counting on you. What is dodgeball? The Guide to Ultra Dodgeball Isn't it like frisbee? They look like the same thing to me. Hold it. Have some steamed dumplings. It's delicious. I already brushed my teeth. I told you it's our wedding anniversary today. Aren't you out camping for the week? There's a lightning warning. I could get killed. You could've gotten a hotel room. I've covered your rent for three months now. I'm dead if she finds out. Relax. Do you want some? I got a job. I'll be coaching a team next week. What can you coach? Have you ever heard of dodgeball? Is it the one where people throw balls at each other? Exactly. It's perfect for me. You always throw balls into people's courts. Anyway, I'll get paid, so I can pay the rent. Don't make empty promises. Honey, he can afford the rent now. Honey, I'll take your bag into our room. I'll make some for you tomorrow. How nice of you. Sir, are you selling insurance or investment funds? Let me introduce him to you. For the next three months, this man next to me will be your dodgeball coach. Coach Lau. You sweat the shirt! What the heck did he say? You sweat the shirt. Your shirt is drenched. We just met and he's already talking like a pervert. A drenched shirt means you've worked up a sweat. Starting today, I'll make you understand the true nature of dodgeball with your sweat in both practice and competitions! Why don't we start with theory today? Dodgeball originated in England in around 1900. Due to the European diaspora, immigrants... Brought the sport to the US. In 1902, Japanese scholars in the US brought it back to Japan, thus spreading it across Asia. Coach, I know Wikipedia too. Really? It's my best buddy. I was just testing you. How impressive. Form a line! Come on. Hey. It's okay. I was just testing them. They have a lot of character. They use different gazes to dodge me. They're so talented. I see. I'm as surprised as you are. Hello. What sports did you do? Do you see that ferocious gaze of hers? She must be a pitcher. Gosh, only you'd have that expertise. So how long is each class? We end at 3 a.m., so there's plenty of time. That's great then. Since everyone is so talented, let's see what you got. Why don't we run 20 laps? Just 20 laps to check your stamina. Run 20 laps? Coach, I can't do it. I gasp when I move. I'll die. Running at night gives me insomnia. Then you guys are doing it wrong. You should use your qi to run. It'll help you sleep better. Why don't you demonstrate it? Stand up and run for us. Running requires both legs. There are external muscles, internal muscles, gluteus maximus, and there's the... There's also gluteus maximus, not glutinous rice. - It is a muscle... - Wait for me. Why don't you listen to me? Under each foot, there's a pressure point... All right. I'll run. When I came in, I noticed... There are seven... Where's the eighth girl? Eighth? We only have seven. What? You need eight players in a dodgeball team. Why do you want to be a social worker? I want to help the needy. Perfect. I'm the person in need of your help. The Hong Kong Dodgeball Cup Minimum 8 people per team - Morning. - Good morning. This is for you. How assertive of you. It's good to be assertive. Let's talk inside. I've been hiding something from you. Actually, I formed the dodgeball team to enter this tournament. Doing well in this tournament is the only way to save Midnight Gymnasium. How do you define doing well? At least the final eight, I guess. If we don't get there, someone else will take over Midnight Gymnasium. I know that three months is not a lot of time. Do you think you can do it? Since you asked me, you know I can do it. Harder! Faster! What's going on? Did you skip your lunch? Who are they? Our opponents for the friendly match. Throw harder! And faster! That's weak! Throw straight! Faster! Excuse me. Hi. I'm Ms. Yeung. I'm a social worker. How can I help you, Ms. Yeung? Please meet our coach. We're here today... Joneshit! Joneshit? It's really you. I can't believe you recognized me. Are you balding yet? Are you still a lady-killer? Do you know each other? Tony Yip, the 100-meter champion. I went to Wah Fung too. I'm a few years younger. Back then, Joneshit let me win. That's not true. You were just good. You didn't just come to praise me, right? My team would like to invite your team to play a friendly... Hold on. Are you kidding me? We just learned the rules. We can't just make them play... Experience is key to getting the feel of the game. My team is preparing for the tournament anyway. Are you interested? Yes. Tony is okay with it. Jones, what do you think? Since you're willing to play us, I'm happy to oblige. Bring it on. Yes. With your current abilities, winning the match and doing well in the tournament would be a miracle. Well said, Ms. Yeung. So we don't have to play? We play. Keep playing and play hard. Coach Lau and I have met with Sprout Sports Club. We'll be playing them in a friendly match. Experience is the best way to improve. Dodge. I'm okay. As the name says, dodgeball means dodging your opponents' balls to avoid losing. For example, look at this tiny thing. Do you know how fast it can go? It's amazing. It can go 116 km per hour. Is that fast? Not quite. Look at this baseball. It's even faster than a ping-pong ball. It can go as fast as 169 km per hour. Did you see that? If you can dodge all these balls, you'll be invincible. All right. You guys love drawing on balls, right? Take a pen. Draw the things you hate the most on the balls and imagine the balls as what you want to avoid at all costs. Then you'll be driven to dodge them. Let me show you a real pitching machine. Dodge! Don't get hit! It has been forever since I've been this exhausted. That was a bit too much. I need some rest. Since we lack money, I can't make uniforms for you all. However, I hope we can agree on a dress code and wear the same color. - It's a girls' team, right? - Right. Of course it's pink. Why can't we wear green instead? Because you look like pink panthers. Thank you for your help. Don't mention it. Betrayal You're stubbornly unrepentant. You make senseless accusations and groundless slander. Diabetes Chewie, who have you been going out with? You're coming home so late. Didn't I ask you to be home by 10 p.m.? Loneliness Laney, I'm stuck at work. Cook something for yourself. Poverty Open up! - Pay up! - Come out! I know you're in there! The beating cane You can't even carry a bottle! Are you useless or what? You're no better than trash! Nothing to be afraid Fanling Youth Center Coach Lau, what's our strategy today? Here's the plan. Laney, you'll be the eliminated player. Doesn't that mean I'm out? No, you have the fun of killing enemies and get back in play. Okay. Give me the board. As I said, Laney will be the eliminated player. Every game starts with an eliminated player. She'll be in the outfield. How do you come back to life? It's simple. Hit an opponent with the ball and you'll get brought back in. The one that was killed goes outfield. If you're hit by the opponent, you go outfield as an eliminated player. When time is up, the team with more players on the court wins. Get it? It's our first game. Come on. Yes, come on! - It's marvelous. - That's 1 to 0. What's up? It's a foul. Your first attack can't hit the player jumping for the ball. Don't you know the rules? A foul? - How should I know? - Why? - It's fine. - Come on. We can do it. Referee. It hurts. Dodge! Dodge it! Don't get scared! They're pretty good at sucking. Dodge! It's 8 to 0. - It's a record. - Change sides. No team has been wiped clean in less than five minutes. In 3 minutes and 27 seconds. Well, there are two sets in a match. After adding up the remaining players in both sets, the team with more players left wins. I wonder if they are able to beat all of our seven players. Team FYI, right? FYC. It's not bad for a new team. I wonder if we'll get a rematch. I'm worried that you'll quit though. You tend to run away when you lose. Dodgeball is perfect for you. Have this. Apply it. - Have another piece. - You're one to talk. I wouldn't have been hit. I'm still sore from it. - Do your nails hurt? - You're mad. - Or is it your forehead? - I saw it. I know you're all sad about losing. You're all masking your emotions, right? It was just a friendly match. Wherever we fall, we can rise again in the same place. Wrong. Wherever we fall is where we'll fall again. We should fight despite the risks. Let me tell you guys the truth. I knew you'd lose this match, but I wanted you to lose spectacularly. I wanted you to find your humility to face your next match, so you'll be motivated to get better. Unfortunately, you have none of that. You have no humility. Jones... Did it sound mean? It's intentional. I have to deal with them this way. Don't worry. They'll reach the top three soon enough. Thank you. All right. You guys must be tired. Get something to eat. - Come on. - Great. That's what I've been waiting to hear. You hit me. They can do it. Jones, do you want to eat with us? No, thank you. There's one more thing. What name should I put on your check? The coach funding I applied for came through. I'll be giving you a check for 2,000 dollars. They wanted to pay in installments, but I got them to pay you in one go. Did you lose a lot of dough? It doesn't look like you lost a match. It looks more like you got robbed. Is the girl hot? It's not one girl. It's nine girls. I got duped. I can't do this. I got to get rid of them. Well, about the rent... Wait. I need to tell you something. Kiki is three months pregnant. She wants to hire a maid, so you... Wait. I can be your maid. Don't bring in an outsider. I can change diapers and... - Honey. - Jones. You can't even take care of yourself. How can you help other people? All these years, your little brother has been supporting you. Honey. You don't owe him jack. You do everything in half measures. When you biked around Taiwan, how many times did you call asking Yuen to pay for your hotels? Other bicyclists don't stay in hotels, but you did it every night. Look, my bike needed a rest too. You sold your mom's flat to invest in that AI homestay and lost a ton of money. That's not my fault. I don't know why homestay can't be legal. What about that shoddy massage helmet? - How much did that lose? - Good question. Why Hongkongers get foot massages but not head massages? Good thing I bailed in time. That's how I stayed alive. I have a question for you. Why does he have a million excuses? You always pick up the tab. Has he persisted in a single thing in his life? - Tell me. Has he? - Yes, I have! I've persisted in staying here! - Honey... - He... - Stay calm for the baby. - It hurts. Honey. - It hurts. - Is it the baby? Listen up, Jones Lau. My friend is hiring. Get the job and move out. Or don't get the job and move out. Otherwise, I won't show you mercy. Don't worry. I'm friends with the owner. He'll fix it up for you. If you have a problem, call me or the owner. All right. What? You don't have a license? That's why I needed your help. Why don't you just take the test? I did, but I failed every time. Either some weirdo got in my way or... Maybe I should've worn a skirt to the test. I won't take it again. You're not driving without a license. Are you nuts? How can I be a cool boss without a car? You'd look cooler if you passed the test. You just don't get it. It's cooler to drive without a license. I've always done that and I've been fine. Fine? Then why am I here? Jeez, are you calling the police on your friend? I'm calling a car to take you home. Just call the police then. If I don't get the car back to my dad by sunrise, you can bury my license in my grave. Put out that cigarette. Resume You haven't had a job since secondary school? Yes. Well, my dream is to start my own business. Then why do you want to work here? Well, I love to travel, but I have to take care of my brother and his wife, so I've been grounded. Then I learned that this restaurant is travel-themed, so I wanted to come and learn. Do you have any travel stories to share? Taiwan island-round bike trip. Did you stop by Gravel Beach? That's an essential stop on the route. I know it. It's in Taitung. It's not in Taitung. It's in Yilan. Do you mean Rocky Beach? That's an easy mistake. Yes. My mistake. Can you start today? - Now? - Right now. - Seriously? - Yes, come on. It's a server job. Come on. I'm here to be a manager. Same difference. Put on this dress. Sure. Put it on and watch your attitude. I'm warning you. It's so different from the job interview. No trousers underneath. Welcome to Bistro No More! Come on in. May I serve you, lady? My friend is already here. I've ordered the food. Why did you ask to meet me? Get this to table 11. Why are you posing? It took me all night to write this repentance letter. Repentance letter You just have to sign it. Do you know assault can be punished with up to three years in jail? All you need to do is sign the letter. Helen, you can get over it, but I can't. Don't be so reckless. He's a school board member's son. Did you get stupid from being beaten? The head prefect maintains order, not get into others' business. I don't hit girls. You've embarrassed me. Helen. Ms. Kei, you said that you saw Mr. Ma bully Ms. Chan. Besides you, did anyone else see this? Yes. Do you remember our school motto? "Truth is virtue." We should always pursue truth. Unlike you, you make senseless accusations and groundless slander. Apologize to Mr. Ma immediately. Well? Do you wish to apologize to Mr. Ma in front of the entire school? You're stubbornly unrepentant. You're birds of a feather. You're just as nosy as her. I know what I did that day. I'm willing to bear the consequences. However, don't expect me to apologize because I did nothing wrong. Check, please. Excuse me. Excuse me. Check, please. Excuse me. - Yes. Anything? - He said, "Excuse me. Check, please." Number 2. Resignation letter Number 7! Hi. Today... I didn't see a thing, so stay out of my business too. Easy there. What's going on? - You even lost your shoe. - Are you hurt? - I have a concern. - Go ahead. FYC is a legit team after all. It's dangerous that they lack sneakers. Someone has already suffered a fall. Don't you think we should perhaps rethink our funding allocation? Thank you. - How about... - Excuse... - Funding? - If we lack funding, - shouldn't we stop? - Sorry. What are you doing here? This is the principal of Haylen's school. He's here to check on his student and to warn you all. Mr. Ma and his dad have been benevolent. You just have to admit that you slandered Mr. Ma and apologize publicly, then they'll accept a settlement and put this behind them. Settlement? So you admit that he's guilty too, right? Your stubborn tongue won't stop wagging. You should all know that this young lady is violent. She beat a fellow student and slandered him. I know that Ms. Yeung is a kind social worker, but if you keep protecting this rabble-rouser, you shall reap what you sow. What exactly happened? This is beyond our jurisdiction. Marchie is a bully and you play dumb because he's the son of a school board member. You're trash. Say that again. You're trash! Did you hear that? She's slandering people again. Helping her makes you accomplices. I reserve my right to legal action. Hi, Mr. Principal. Who are you? I'm Haylen's coach. What's the matter? Here's the thing. To be frank, she understands the virtue of restraint. However, she's young. She needs time to digest things. As they say, "No pain, no gain. Faith will move mountains." Young people need time. So after class at 3 a.m., we shall confer again. Well, 3 a.m. is when the liver detoxifies. It would be harmful to meet. I have said my piece for today. I believe you to be a smart and educated man. I hope you'll lend a hand and help Ms. Kei before it's too late for her. Goodbye. Be mindful of your conduct. Restraint is a virtue. Didn't I tell you to stay out of my business? Your business is my business. I don't need your boomer ways to solve my problems. I'm not like you. You cower. I don't. Are you okay? I'm fine. Don't take it personally. How silly. Young athletes should possess a fiery spirit. As a coach, I'm happy to see it. However, controlling their emotions is the key to winning. Besides, you saw how things unfolded just now. What were you saying about funding? Lack of funding. I meant those kids in Kenya can even play football barefoot. We can use new ways to train them without funding. For example, practice barefoot. Yes. Jones, you're so encouraging. I was worried you wanted me to ask for more funding. By the way, sorry for taking so long with this. We're counting on you. - Sure. - Thank you so much. - I'll get going. - Bye. Two thousand dollars only Hi, Mrs. Coach. Hear what your coach has to say. Jones. Tony. Tony Yip, you gave up Team Hong Kong to coach a bunch of kids? When will you give me that gold medal? Jones Lau, I'm not jinxing you, but you lie about keeping up running every year. I bet that your belly is so big that you can't even walk. - Give me a break. - Give me a break. I quit because of my ligament injury. You can't blame me, right? I don't have a belly. Look, I'm fit. I even finished the Mount Fuji Marathon. You two competed so hard that you forgot your friendship. Your coach really wanted to see you two race again. For the last time, stop calling me that name. - Joneshit really is your name. - Again? Explain yourself then. After every race, you hide in the changing room for over an hour. - You must've shat your pants. - Did you witness that? Why do you hide in the changing room then? Explain that. You're such an idiot. I was stealing your thunder. Understand? "Jones Lau, please come and receive your prize." That's when I go missing. When they called me, I'd hide in the changing room. I hid until they announced it again, "Jones Lau, please come and receive your prize." I couldn't get first place, but everyone knew that I got a prize. Do you understand now? I know I'm doomed to be second. Whether it's studying or sports, someone else is always the number one. Someone is always in the way. That's how it was. So you stopped giving your all. It's because if you didn't try hard, you'd feel better about losing. You were afraid that you have given your all and still lost in the end. Every time I raced you, I didn't dare to turn my head. I always thought, "Jones, you brat. Why are you always on my tail?" If you weren't there, how could I have been number one? Pushing someone to achieve is an achievement too. Catch me if you can. Good. Put your back into it. When is this over? How much longer? Do you want to know the true nature of dodgeball? Tell me. Dodging may prevent you from losing. Okay. However, if you want to win, you have to catch the ball. Eye on the ball is how you get back the right to throw. Understand? Yes. I have to catch the ball. - Okay. Bring it on. - Keep going. Hey! Joneshit! The vest! I'll return it later! - Who are you? - What is this? Don't touch our stuff. - Stop. - Who are you? Calm down. Don't exert yourself too much. I hired these movers. Excuse me. What did you lose money on this time? Why are you selling your stuff? How much do you owe now? I'm not in debt. I decided to give up staying here. I'm moving out. - What? - Moving out? Yes, to give some space to the baby. Also, I've been meaning to say this. Pardon my intrusion. Sorry, guys. I don't have much for you. Have the air fryer. Jones. Take care. You too. Honey! Come on, baby. Yes! Jones. Do you want some water? Call me Coach. Yes, Coach. Starting today, I'm getting serious! Coach Lau, do you mean you weren't serious before? I want you to catch the ball. Try catching the ball. Dodge if you can't catch it. It's okay. Next. Catch the ball. Catch the ball. I haven't served yet. Left, right... - Find the fat lady! - Find the fat lady! - Keep running! - Don't stop until I say so! Sorry. Again. Catch the ball. Catch the ball. Coach, how much longer will it go on? Until you catch it. Catch! Wherever we fall is where we'll fall again. How long is the round-the-island tour? It's 968 km. You've already ridden that much for deliveries. It appears so. - Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. - Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. This isn't a dance but a formation I created. The One Formation. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. - Find the fat lady. - Find the fat lady. - Find the fat lady. - Find the fat lady. - Find the fat lady! - Find the fat lady! "Training camp in Japan, travel expenses paid." Japanese hunks. Thank you for finding a sponsor, Chewie! Keep it up, everyone! My goodness. Ready? The timer is starting. Why are they so hard to get rid of? What should I do? Take it. - You can't pass infield. - Pass it to Laney. Hurry, give it to Laney. - Laney. - Laney. Sorry. I did that? - What are you doing? - Hi. It's a comfy home for one in here. "At the Taiwan Heart-to-Heart Island-Round Race, a Hong Kong participant with the surname Lau stayed in a hotel during the race and placed the organizer's GPS tracker in another racer's bag to change his race time. He was disqualified in the end." There's a mosaic on the photo, but from the hairstyle... That wasn't permed. Let's say this gets out, I'm worried that even if FYC wins the tournament, their win would be doubted because of their coach's credibility. It turns out he'd do anything to win. Take a guess. How will your girls see you when they hear about this? Take a guess. How will the Dodgeball Association see you when they hear about this? - What do you want? - You leave. It's the best and fairest thing for them. You don't want their hard work wasted because of you, right? FYC! - A! - A! - Cheers! - Cheers! I'm sure we'll win our match against Kwai Wah Sports Club. - You guys are great. - I bought pastries. - Thank you. - Thank you. - They look great. - Thank you. I want the chocolate flavor. After eating my farewell pastries, I'm quitting. What? Farewell? Quitting? I'm quitting the team. Why are you quitting? I've taught all I can. This is all I've got. I realized that with your abilities and morale, you can reach the knockout rounds. What about our Japan trip? If you leave, we'll lose for sure. I never said we were going to Japan. It was your idea. I never liked it. You're trash. Hey, Lily. I'm not trash. I just found a better job. Hours are good and the salary is good. You know what? This job... I didn't want to say it because... Pro bono work can't last forever, right? Sorry. I know I didn't get enough funding. - I'll hire you myself... - No, don't. - Please stay. - How could you say that? - I'll pay you. - Don't... Jones Lau! How much can you possibly make from deliveries? You adults are all the same. You tell us to be brave and catch the ball. The ball is flying at you now, but you choose to dodge too. - Don't say that... - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Coach Lau. - Ms. Yeung. He dumped you. A man like him is not worth having. Do you know what you've done? You pushed your coach away. If we lose, Midnight Gymnasium is over. Let it end then. We don't care about the gymnasium. We just wanted a trip to Japan. Let that prick take over. I just won't come here anymore. Then where will you go at night? How about you, Ms. Yeung? Where will you go at night? Fanling Youth Center Haylen Kei Lily Turn Lemon Into Lemonade I'm Ms. Yeung and I'm busy. I'll call you back later. Excuse me. Which one of you is Haylen Kei? Hi, I'm Marchie Ma's lawyer. My name is... I hear that you don't have a lawyer. I'll give you some advice. It's free of charge. Dress decently and be courteous when in court. Chewie, choose your friends more wisely. Be home early. "I'll give you some advice. It's free of charge. Dress decently when in court." Your dad is kind of bad. He's almost as bad as my dad. Sorry. You're you. You're not him. I can talk to him. Forget it. If she'd budge, things wouldn't have turned out this way. Aren't you afraid of jail? I am. However, I'm more afraid of swallowing injustice. If you're really going to jail, is there anything you want to do? School security Hey, who hasn't paid the taxi fare? Shut up and go. Is it you? Are you done? Hurry up. It's hot here. Stop talking and come over. - Is it done? - Hurry. Where's mine? Guys, will we be in trouble if we get caught? I can't see anything. This is bad. I hear noises. So cheap What are you doing here? Freeze! I figured out what I can do at night. Uber driver. Even if I lose you, there are countless kids who need rides. - Stop talking. - Hop on! - I'll be an Uber driver. - Hurry! Let's go. Step on it. Bye. - Stay away. We'll run you over. - Stop! Didn't you take the day off for your game today? I'm not going anymore. I've observed you for a long time. I've been wanting to tell you. You have a really selfish face. More selfish than you? Hello? Who are these people? How could they beat Sea Lion? They're at-risk kids and night drifters. A bunch of losers. There are all kinds of losers. Don't underestimate them. - Yes, sir! - Yes, sir! Give your all. Do your best. That's so tacky, Ms. Yeung. Okay. FYC. - A! - A! Four-and-attack. Pauline! - Pauline. - I'm here, Coach. I'm locked in here. I'm here. It's stuck. Wait. I'll break it down. Okay. Back away. - Are you okay? - I'm fine. Sorry for this. Good thing you came. Ms. Yeung took the girls to the exam. Right. They went to a match, not an exam. - Yes. - Right. A match. It's okay. I'll clean up. Nothing to be afraid Diabetes Losing, by Yanki Good throw. Yes! She hit her. She really hit her. She hit her. Didn't you see that? She hit her. Why are you waving? She really hit her! Don't you have eyes, old fart? - If you're blind, don't be a referee. - Stop it, Boss. - Let's go back. - Leave it, Lily. - What is this? - Lily, go back to the game. What are you even doing with that card? What a lousy referee. You're lousy. Do you hear me? I'm talking to you. Go watch your grandchildren instead. You're not a real referee. Boss! Hey! Boss! Are you okay? She threw it at her head! Hey, that's an intentional head throw. Number 1 made dodging action. There was no foul. Number 1 is out. We quit! We quit! Let's leave. I'm fine. Keep playing. Come on. Good. Very good. Come on, girls. Great job. Yes. Yes. Good. Girls. Come on. Very good. Good job. Yes. What? Are you here to surrender? It's okay to be losers, but you should know that there are people who are born to be stepped on by the strong. If you give me a sad puppy pity face, maybe I'll soften up and tell them to take it easy in set two, okay? You made dodging action. It wasn't a foul. I wanted to tell you. It's fine if the referee makes a bad call. Just throw again. If it doesn't work, throw it again and again. Throw a hundred times until they can finally see it. I'm not done. What are you doing? Why a red card? I'm not a coach. I'm just a delivery guy. Go away. Hey. The delivery is for you guys. Remember to open it. FYC. A. FYC. Takeout. FYC. Takeout. My leg is breaking. How did it go? It's no big deal. Just messing with you. We won! No way. We won! My notes were good, right? What notes? I wrote you a bunch of notes. Didn't you... In here? Didn't you see my hard work? Sorry, we didn't read it. It's okay. At least you won. Good work. Okay, I'm going back to work. - Bye. - Bye, Coach Lau. - Bye. - Bye. Bye. - Ms. Yeung, let's go eat. - I'm starving. Ms. Yeung, I'm hankering for meat. Let's eat fish. Did it hurt? That's the first time you touched my shoulder. Are you guys going to celebrate? Why don't we go celebrate? Let's celebrate. I was wrong. I acted like a boomer. I have a secret. I did a very dumb thing a long time ago. It might affect you. I didn't want you to know, so I quit. That's all. Where's the apology? I'm sorry, everyone. A man who apologizes is a good man. What were you expecting? Kiss her! - Bring it in. - Come on. - Yes! - Yes! The head office has sent a letter demanding us to discipline FYC. Also, Kwai Wah is threatening legal action. Speaking of which, I went to a bonesetter. Can I claim my fees from the head office? Superintendent, FYC has players and a coach that assault people. We must end Midnight Gymnasium and disband the team right now. You're a liar. I'm not a liar. I... Do you have proof? Show it. - A video. - You saw it? - I have a video. - Show it. - Not to you. - Play it now. - Do you have the password? - Show us the proof. - Are you afraid we'll find your porn? - How childish. You're childish. Gosh, that bad breath. I don't. I brush my teeth. End Midnight Gymnasium. You can close the gym, but the game must go on. I promised the girls that they'd play. In this day and age, it doesn't matter if the gymnasium stays or not. As long as there are kids who need us, Midnight Gymnasium can be anywhere. You're finally willing to leave your comfort zone. What does that mean? Keep playing. Hearing you makes me want to play too. Go on! Thank you. FYC Girls Team Chat Room Lily: Good game tomorrow. Haylen: Fierce youth A. Lily: Fierce youth B.

Barrister Cheung Kwan-ching was arrested for obstructing justice. Sources say between February and April 2019, while Cheung was on the Ma Kwai College's rape case, he concealed facts and induced witnesses to lie to investigators. His trainee social worker daughter defended her dad on social media, attracting threats and doxing by netizens. The family has filed a police report. In other news... Calm down. - Stay calm. - How can I calm down? We're surrounded by reporters! I know! Just shut up! Ms. Yeung, Mobile phone Shut up! Arrested for Obstructing Justice Do you think Chewie will come? I wouldn't show up if I were her. She has been doxed. Netizens threatened to surround her place. The number you dialed is busy right now. Please call again. Social workers feel powerless all the time. Hey, why don't we forfeit? Of course not. Just joking. It's time. What about Chewie? Let her decide. Let's go. Number 3! - Conserve your energy. - Warm up. Don't get hurt. Will you go easy on us? Go easy? Even if I say yes, my girls won't. Look at them. These days, we old farts don't call the shots anymore. FYC. I know you don't blame Chewie. She's dealing with more important things than this match. Running away is a necessary part of solving problems. We've all been there. Chewie is just outfield for now. It doesn't mean she'll never come back to the infield. FYC! FYC! - A! - A! Wherever we fall... - Is where we'll fall again. - Is where we'll fall again. You only have seven players? Yes, only seven. Seven? Starting one player down is halfway to losing. That's so cool. Regulations say you must have a full team for the game to proceed. Our team isn't against the other team starting with seven players. You're the one going easy on us. Since both coaches agree to this, the referees have unanimously decided to let the game proceed. However... Isn't that the coach who hits people? Didn't he get suspended? Let's get away from him. - Go, Sprouts! - Go, Sprouts! Go, FYC! Go, FYC! Go, FYC! There are many problems in life. Some can be solved, but others can't be solved. People will tell you, "Don't be afraid. Face them with courage." However, I want to say, we're just tired. We don't want to deal with it for now. We want a break and some quiet time alone. When a problem is unsolved, it's just not the right time to solve them yet. For the charge of assault, the court finds Haylen Kei... Wait for the right time. I know that you'll solve those problems eventually. Sometimes, you think you are facing your problems alone. That's not true. There are others facing them with you. - Step!
