The action is set in Flanders in 1616... ... when Spanish rule under Philip III was becoming less oppressive The horrors of war, however... ... remained in the memories of the people of the Low Countries The theme is not drawn from history The serio-comic narrative is set in a small town... ... with its canal, its houses rich in gleaming woodwork... ... and its people looking forward to its carnival The film-makers'choice of this for their setting... ... enabled them to draw upon the art of the great Flemish painters... ... whose works enrich our museums with their truth and humanity It was doubtless because this film... ... added joyous good humour to its imagination... ... that the jury of the GRAND PRIX DU CIN?MA gave it the highest honour Get on with it! The carnival begins tonight FLANDERS AND FREEDOM Action 36: Blow on the fuse and open the pan Action 37: Adjust the fuse Wake up, Jef! Action 38: Take aim - What's the matter, Jacob? - It's my lumbago Some parade it's going to be Is the beef really tender? - The customer has no change - She can pay later Don't forget my usual three pound joint They're waiting for me at the Town Hall - Has your husband gone? - Yes, and left the work to me Save four soles for me It's too late to rehearse now Put this on the pole for me Don't forget the four pies for the Mayoress Carry your ruff carefully Should I roast the eighth chicken? No, seven's enough; our Deputy Mayor's a bachelor I've brought your pies, Mayoress Not such thick peel, girl; you're wasteful Dry Mieke carefully, especially between the toes I want my arrow; I scored a bull's-eye Stop it, or I'll tell your mother I didn't think you were such a ninny Stop provoking the child And since when has the gallery been a playground? All you've done is gaze at that medallion, Siska I've done a lot You'll never finish in time Mother, if only you knew I know; I was sixteen once... ...dreaming of a handsome youth Was it father? Take care of that cup, I've only two left Weren't you deliriously happy on your betrothal day? Delirious? Oh, well, yes... This morning Jean is going to ask father for my hand I'm so glad Your betrothal is a day to remember What if father refuses? I give my consent Jean Breughel... ... a self-portrait at twenty He's very talented Like his father - and he's earning his own living It does no harm if life's a bit of a struggle at first Nothing else matters when you're young and in love You understand artists, mother Let me go to the Town Hall to hear father's decision Finish your work first Add some white to the carmine Mayor, your pose These flies are a nuisance It's because of your cake At last, Deputy Mayor! We've been waiting half an hour I stopped at the church to light a candle To Saint Gudule, in hope of marriage? Or Saint Roch, to cure his cows Gentlemen, don't jest about sacred matters For once you are all here. Take your poses, please Deputy Mayor, are you on your mark? A more martial air It looks more stupid than martial And don't hold the standard like a fly-swatter Don't be rude I can't work properly You always look different Your hair was straight, now it's in archangel's curls To captivate the ladies I'll make mincemeat of him! Moderate your remarks, my friend The painter's right I know you're a serious artist, but it's time for a rest It looks like real linen I'm not that fat It's a good likeness You work quickly and don't make a mess What more can one ask of a painter? Urgent things for you to sign - You can recognize my ring - You even see my mole Have you thought over my proposal, Mayor? Are we not in agreement? No, but we're getting there After all, our professions are complementary I raise cattle and you dispose of them You agree... ...to buy livestock from me exclusively Very nice, but I am giving you my daughter, Siska Without dowry - We'll say no more - I was only joking I give you my daughter, but the question is... ...how many oxen, calves and pigs will you buy a year? Here are my accounts, judge for yourself What did father say? - I haven't asked him yet - Go and see him now, in his office He won't eat you, just do it Magnificent! I give you my word... my word of honour I'm pleased with you, my young friend May I have the honour... I have come to ask... I know, you want your money I was young once; wine, women and song are expensive You mustn't think that... Enjoy yourself. Your picture's worth all of five crowns I have the honour to ask... You haven't dined at the Mayor's before? What wines he has I'd rather have a beer any day Siska, have you come to hear your father's decision? How did you know? It's all right; your father agrees Your happiness makes me happy - You're very kind - You'll see You'll live with a husband who adores you Let me kiss you properly, as a fianc? should We'll be married in a month, a first-class affair My delightful, precious girl, in a month you'll be mine How changeable women are A draft for five crowns in the name of Monsieur Breughel I didn't come for money, I came to ask for Siska's hand Too late Besides, she'll not marry an artist; no paupers in my family They served ten entr?es, eight roasts and twelve other dishes We're waiting for you No, I'm still waiting for one more It's the Deputy Mayor again Can't you be trusted alone for five minutes? They should sweep the stairs more often Anything broken? Please keep still I'd like to see you in my position You're moving on purpose You're paid to paint, so shut up! What about art? What's art? I've been painted before without such a fuss Go back to your dauber My "dauber", sir, was Rubens Could Rubens paint that? Not to the brim, I said Have you seen Jean? Did you see your father, then? Speak up It's the end of everything You haven't spoken to Jean or your father... ...so how do you know it's the end of everything? Crying won't help The butcher tried to kiss me Did you slap him? That's my girl! He said we'd be married in a month He was drunk He said father agreed What cunning! I might have guessed No wonder your father was so considerate When a husband's charming, he's up to something. I'll have a word with him This very instant. Dry your eyes Never shake burgundy A butcher, indeed! Why not the knacker? Have you told your wife? I'm not answerable to her; in my own house I'm... ...master - Tell her the news now - It's not the right moment My dear Cornelia, are you looking for me? May I call you mother-in-law? Has the carnival begun already? Why the sudden regard for this calf-killer? Do you trade in daughters? You've made her cry A girlish fancy Don't you think I should be consulted? Like all Frenchwomen, you're never lost for words Not like you. I've nothing to hide Let everyone hear what a wretch you are Wait till we get home You're a tyrant, not the good father you make out Appearances are deceptive Look at them, playing at soldiers What if you are outnumbered by the enemy? A rifleman fights to the death, but never retreats Where's the Town Hall? Try to be dignified and a little haughty Open the door. Are you afraid? How gracefully those mountebanks ride They're Spaniards! - Did you hear? - I'm not deaf But it's your problem; rank always brings risks The Mayor is always hanged first Where duty calls, I go It's the royal seal - What's it about? - Open it You open it, you're oldest A letter for you, Mayor Gentlemen, a stiff upper lip is called for His Excellency, Don Pedro de Guzman... ... Duke of Olivieres, Ambassador of His Most Catholic Majesty... ... will spend the night at Boom, with his entourage and escort Officers of the Guild of Saint Cyprien, rally round the flag! - Already tattered? - I've been shot at twice But still ours - You shouldn't provoke them - It's my nature - We can but pray - Why despair so easily? The troops will liven up the town Were you too young... ...to remember the horrors of the occupation? Passing soldiers bring passing trade They sacked Antwerp in a night Young man, hell has nothing like Spanish fury Our houses will be pillaged and reduced to ashes Blood will run in the streets, our women will be violated Suckling babes will be hurled from the windows... ...before your very eyes... ...and you, city fathers, will be mutilated Believe me... ...the slightest resistance will bring death to us all If there must be a victim, let it be me My friends, has heaven inspired me? I have an idea The Town Crier must proclaim this before midday The Mayor, Father of the City... ...heeding naught but his own courage... ...is ready comma as always comma to sacrifice himself... ...for the sake of his beloved people Hurry up, they'll be here within an hour Do your know your prayers? Say them Again? God knows them already Never mind, say them all over again - It's Jean - Ask him in I won't have to say my prayers Don't look so miserable We may never see each other again Mother's on our side Have we time for happiness? The Spaniards are coming If anything happens, my last thought will be of you You were my only love Have you finished? What are you getting so worked up about? Put him back to bed, on his right side There'll be time enough to worry when... There, there; lean on my arm Would you like the smelling-salts? You are right to chide me. I wish to be a man worthy of... I don't wish to bother your husband I'm here I have come to take my leave... Your affairs matter little when the enemy is at the gates - What will you do? - Don't be inquisitive I'm not inquisitive, I'm suspicious Civic interests don't concern women Have you any consecrated box-wood? Are you going to fight with that? Let us not quarrel in the face of the enemy Let us unite Get a pair of clean sheets What's father doing in there? I don't know; stop asking childish questions I suppose you don't know what's going on You can't see beyond your paintbrushes Find out what's happening You stay here; all you think of is kissing and cuddling Have you got the best linen sheets? And the pillowcases, too Kiss me It's Martha I'm sorry to have to keep going to and fro Careful, they're not cutlets and steaks They're shifting the furniture now For a barricade? They're not using grandmother's wardrobe for a barricade! Can't you tell me? Can't I help you? What shall I do? Nothing. Matters of civic importance are not for women I sharpened that this morning; it will go rusty You won't understand; it's a matter of civic importance - What are you doing? - None of your business What if a thief is watching? You might explain to me Matters of civic interest are beyond your comprehension I see the top of the wardrobe Look again, don't give up so easily Can you see better? What are they hammering? The canopy is in the way So you won't tell me anything I see the butcher's feet on a chair, his hands over his head... ...with a hammer Get down, I'll have a look Do you feel strong? Yes or no? Poor Siska What a brute that butcher is Maybe, but I'm sure he could lift me Doubtless you have come to... I'll show you the way So that's the game Who let her in? A big, healthy man, pretending to be dead Because you're scared of the Spaniards I'm not discussing my plan with silly geese May the Spaniards give you a fitting burial Shut up, and don't give the game away All your military displays are just a sham ... persons resisting will lead to reprisals Everyone must remain calm and obedient... ... accepting heaven's decree, in the name of our Holy Church The Mayor is a shrewd politician I'll not put my nose out of doors - What if they find you? - I've a good hiding place - What about your shop? - My wife will be there - They'll have her skirts up - No danger of that She's safe, all right Soldiers aren't bad What do you know? It's a matter of civic interest Admit you're a coward You men aren't even jealous now Why bother to resist? If you're weak, what's the use? No fighting to the death for the rifleman? Going to hide? Certainly. I'm hiding so as to fight again another day Brave deserter There's no sense in trying to make women see reason Go to bed, the lot of you Women, as the men have lost control of the situation... ...we'll replace them Let's do without them But that's impossible - Why? - You know very well That way men need us more than we need them Where was I? In a nutshell, the situation is that the Spaniards are coming Terrible, armed to the teeth, and we must meet them bare handed We're beaten already Since the Garden of Eden, woman has had the strongest weapon We can't rule, that's the man's job Don't we rule our house and children? But we can't rule men Ruling men is even easier Women, we've let this go on too long We followed our mothers' example and let men rule... ...but today's events have opened our eyes Let us women set an example to the whole of Flanders... ...by saving the town through our decisiveness and courage And now deeds, not words Firstly, the tired Spanish men will be thirsty Ajob for the brewer's wife It sounds like a farmyard before a storm God save us from their help We must stop this cackling You two watch from the tower; wave to us when you see them You all know what to do? Get ready, then In silence Lean on me; be careful the steps are worn Can you smell the wind of Flanders? All the distant flowers Are you sad? Why? I don't know; I feel hot and cold Sometimes I wouldn't mind dying I feel the same; we're so alike I'll paint you as the Virgin, Salome, Eve, Joan of Arc... I shall paint you all my life - What do you want? - Something for Madame - What's that? - Madame's mourning dress As tight as you can How nice, I haven't changed in five years I'm the same size as I was at the great Guild banquet You may look now. What did you want to tell me? Mother, I know everything; don't go alone to the gate The other ladies will be with me You need a man; I'll go With your bow? Hold the mirror for me now What if you don't come back? Why all this dressing up? It concerns civic matters which are not for men WELCOME TO OUR VISITORS I had to sew up two holes in my dress You always wear the latest fashion Sleeves are wider now, surely. Anyway, I'm so thirsty I can't swallow a drop Have we got everything? Where's the key? Give it another polish, girl It's too hot to walk quickly - Are you ill? - It's the suspense Try to pray. God knows what sacrifices this duke expects - I'll offer myself - Egoist I want you to say something no one else has ever said to me That's difficult I love you I haven't a handkerchief to wave The hour has struck What do you call the Duke? Formally, I mean - Majesty - No, Monseigneur, perhaps? - He's not a bishop - Well, we'll see Will these glasses be enough? Where's the key? Monseigneur, the townswomen... - He said Monseigneur - I guessed right ...are waiting to welcome you Are they pretty? Let's see I scarcely anticipated such a welcome, Madame Monseigneur, gentlemen, please refresh yourselves Judging by this reception, our visit will be delightful Alas, Monseigneur, I bear sad tidings Our town is in mourning for its late, lamented Mayor I am his widow, Monseigneur I beg you... ...journey on to a less mournful town Madame, your wish will be fulfilled Our men have come a long way The Archduke's messengers expect to find you here The horses must be re-shod You hear, Madame? As things are, I fear we must stay... ...but rest assured we shall respect your sorrow By dawn we shall have left the town quietly Half-past twelve. It worked; the Spaniards have gone Heaven has answered you - Who was right? - You, as always Shoulder pikes! The drums will be muted You are so considerate It's like the prophet entering the promised land - They march strangely - It's the Spanish way These open faces gladden my heart Are their husbands working in the fields? We're the only men A dwarf, like in a circus - What are you looking at? - Real men - You mustn't go out - It's no fun indoors I hate war, and soldiers bore me How singular of you, Monseigneur - I've torn my sleeve - I'll sew it for you - I'm awfully ticklish - Your skin is so soft Those pleats are most becoming It's just a simple robe Isn't it a Dominican habit? The Dominicans attached to the Inquisition I was once Assessor at Toledo; that ages one Isn't blood flowing in the gutters? They're marching in good order - My wife is joking with an officer - Mine's with a friar What about mine? She's with the leader They haven't lost their sense of rank - Plenty of women - We've struck it lucky - What was that drink? - Beer; you had it in Brussels - So hairy - So dark What darling monkeys One of these men stole a duck from me Who stole a duck? Well, if you can't recognize him... - Hang him by the feet, twenty minutes - Hanged by the feet for a duck? Such a nice boy By the feet, like Saint Andrew Discipline is the mainspring of an army The first men we've seen here The artist has talent Influenced by the Venetians, but nevertheless... If these are the native men, I pity the women A little Christian charity; you know nothing of art My taste is different; I prefer El Greco - Give me the Register - Without written authorization? - We're abolishing red tape - Authority is dead I'd like to billet NCOs; the senior ranks I can help the Second Lieutenant with his diet I also have room for some of the guardsmen I don't mind the lower ranks I'll make the Chaplain comfortable A pallet of straw in the stables will suffice for me First things first Monseigneur, will you do me the honour... ...of staying at the Mayoral house? I shall respect your grief and stay at the inn My inn is widely renowned My husband would not have let anyone else serve you The rooms have been repainted; not a bug is left Clean sheets for every guest, even for one night only I must sew your doublet I always have thread on me. Keep still Wouldn't it be easier if I took it off? No, I can reach - Quickly - Are you hard pressed? - What do you take me for? - The prettiest woman I ever saw - Stop, or I'll be cross - Why? You really ought to pull the curtain Put it on the tray - They're here - Warn the Mayor The guests have arrived The guests? The other way round, girl! Monseigneur, may I show you to your room? Madame, first I must pay my respects to the late Mayor Monseigneur, you are too gracious I wish to lay flowers at the bier How did he die? Suddenly Are there other cases in town? Yes, very many Could it be an epidemic? Better burn the body You are very brave, but I will leave you to your grief The poor man did well to die What do you mean? Death is sometimes a deliverance, not only for the departed God bless you Did you put your banner there on purpose? - I tore it on a nail - I'll sew it for you My good sir, what do you take me for? The sun's in my eyes Mind my dress Here is your water, hot and cold As I thought. It smells of fish, too Funny, I can't smell it; I must be used to it The entire house reeks of fish The slightest smell upsets me Open the window I've only a shirt on So I see; lovely lace. Malines, isn't it? Just like mine, as you can see I'll take your word for it Madame, allow me to perform my ablutions I want to wash! How many pillows, Monseigneur? Monseigneur sleeps without pillows - Monseigneur's slippers are lost - I was fond of them A gift? I will catch cold if I put my boots on again Satisfied? How clever to let them into town Into my very house Answer me You can laugh, it's me who's dead I gave them to him five years ago; they've outlasted him Have your fun Just wait till the Spaniards have gone What sort of man is the Duke? I'll introduce you; call him Monseigneur You have found me some slippers, much better than my own See that these are not lost Monseigneur, allow me to present my daughter, Siska Your sister, surely, Madame My eldest daughter; I have another as big as him - Is this your son? - No, the painter Jean Breughel I knew your father, and I've seen your work at the Town Hall Painters inherit talent as kings inherit crowns I congratulate you both The fife is nice, but I prefer drums. Play something - A rigadoon? - No, a charge I'll improvise, but close the door or we'll disturb everyone Not on duty, sir? I've done my four hours at the bier. Where's my wife? Accommodating the officers No rows or fights? Be very polite to the invaders Haven't you seen enough of our enemies yet? You're wasting your time with her That's what you think Have you come far? We've come from Brussels You speak our language well - He's Swiss - From Fribourg Try my cigars - Where are you from? - Piedmont Yet you're both Spanish soldiers? For the moment I've fought for France against Austria, Austria against France... Have you no preference? Yes, for the highest bidder See, Albert, they're just like other men I'm in room seven; where is the mistress of the inn? I have something that needs sewing I'm looking for her myself The sergeant in number seven has something to be sewn Be nice to him, he's an NCO I'm sorry to disturb you, but have you seen my wife? She has just gone to dine with the Mayoress Aren't you going? No, I'm on duty; I don't like such affairs, anyway I don't enjoy such functions, either - Excuse me - Keep me company That's delicate work I have a certain skill. Do you appreciate needlework? I do some myself, but not so well Flatterer! Fetch your own work It's here; this is my room I'm sorry I've disturbed you You honour my house Do you favour ribbing? Two plain, two purl for the feet, and one and one for the legs I use a much finer pattern altogether - It wears less well - It's kinder to the skin Before profiting from God's goodly gifts... ...let us think reverently of the master of the house... ...happier than we now that he knows the only true life Domini exaudi orationem meam. I'm hungry So am I I hope you will like my cooking I'm fond of Flemish dishes, Madame What's that? The works of Erasmus Will you bore us with that heretic? No, I'll sit on him Fitting tribute Sit closer - Do your monkeys eat meat? - They eat everything - You look happier now - At least we'll eat well - After you, Father - I'll not touch a morsel Look at the tiny pitchfork Court manners. Watch how Monseigneur uses the fork I'm embarrased by being the centre of attraction What skill I always have difficulty in cutting meat, anyway Turn the prongs the other way It's nerves; I can't help laughing. It's the same at funerals Come on, play up! Let's have a lively tune! No dancing on a day of mourning You can't make the Spaniards weep over your dead Mayor The thing is... ...I don't want a riot Nonsense. They're well behaved, good customers Let them enjoy themselves, no one will mind It's true, there's nothing like an army Any army is good for trade Armies are indispensable The Spaniards have been maligned Well, that's politics That's the end! Music on a day of public mourning Why hasn't the butcher come back? I'm starving The food isn't for you Lobster, pat?, burgundy My burgundy! Where's that butcher got to? You can't trust him with anything - He's only just gone - You've had your dinner! We bring you the Andalusian breeze from our mountains How delighfully you talk I shall cool your forehead with palm leaves, like an Arab Let the Mayoress be your model, ladies She plies a fan better than any Seville beauty No one taught me Please go on, for my delectation Father, tell us about the Inquisition That was long ago For our edification Not that; the white wine You remind me of a girl broken by flagellation Was she naked? Like Eve before the Fall She was smeared with honey... ...and a he-goat licked her with his scabrous tongue Erasmus numbs my bum Sit on my lap, my lad, don't be afraid - How old are you lad? - Forty-two Good heavens! Get off at once! Here I am and here I stay So that's how it is When Monseigneur learns of your mockery, you'll be sorry Look, lad... your lordship We're family men I'm engaged to be married I'll give you fifty crowns A hundred crowns You'll hang Two hundred crowns if you'll not breathe a word I'll not breathe a word They've gone to the dance and left me to my reverie Flask in hand Quite fortuitous. What have you there? - You look unwell - I'm fine Why so flushed? You look feverish I'm ticklish Are you starting to grow at last? The Duke disapproves of quick routes to wealth - There's something in it for you - I have avowed poverty The dead man isn't dead So you extorted money from cowards. It shall be returned I'll give you twenty-five crowns Fifty crowns A hundred crowns, for your charities The only argument that overcomes my harsh scruples Now let us go to the inn - to discourage deplorable excesses Take your places for the Knights of the Arquebus - Where are you billeted? - Here at the inn Are you well catered for? Extremely well Pity, I have lots of room and my husband's away on duty An earwig has dropped down my back, Lieutenant! Shall I lend a hand? If Monseigneur drinks from this glass, we will treasure it Monseigneur is not thirsty Just put your lips to it Stop pestering Monseigneur These people are tactless You do not have to stay, Monseigneur; are you bored? With you? How could you imagine that? Shall we take the air? I'm fond of the people, but not in such a sweat The night is scented with jasmine They haven't seen us. They're planning their future It is never too late at any age to enjoy happiness This is just a dream; the Spaniards will leave tomorrow The butcher will come to claim his fianc?e - I'd rather die - Have you really thought of that? - Did you favour the sword or poison? - Poison - I agree; it's much tidier - One suffers less Tomorrow we shall be united for ever A single rose will blossom on our graves - It's mother I'm sorry for - Yes, I loved her, too Poor mother The moon on the water, the songs... it's just like Venice Have you been there? I dream of going there. The Leaning Tower... That's at Pisa Italy... the sun, the orange trees... I'd love to travel, read poetry by moonlight... Bathe at night in the Sea of... Well, the sea that's there I've never known such joys It's not too late It is... but I want my daughter to know them Live now, wait not for tomorrow Life's roses should be gathered from today Did you write that? Do you say that to all the women? If only you knew how lonely I am People have strange ideas about the nobility I'm terrified of thunder - and mice. I can't help it If I could live an ordinary life here, with a wife like you... That's a dream. All I want is my daughter's happiness And you alone can help me, Monseigneur Call me Pedro Don't ask the impossible of me Take my fatherless child under your protection Command her marriage I am your humble servant, Madame Monseigneur, to show my gratitude I would like... I'll fetch the Deputy Mayor to register their marriage - And us? - Monseigneur, have pity Whose fault is it if the dead man is practically a cuckold? I advise you to make less noise Does it disturb your banquet? It wasn't us who died I've come for the Deputy Mayor, to act as magistrate Kindly prepare for the marriage of Siska and Jean Breughel Over my dead body! Don't push me too far, you and your Duke Get back in bed, he's not far away You refuse to come with me? That's final? Who dares raise his voice to a widow at her husband's bier? Not me Aren't you delighted by the news of this ideal match? - Double six - My backside! Let us think of higher things Sew this for me, will you? You, too? No, I've run out of thread Have you seen Monseigneur's Chaplain, Madame? He was here a moment ago Will you marry us? With pleasure, but in more dignified surroundings At my home Excellent, the wine is better there Between Siska de Witt and Jean Breughel Add: Who have declared to us... - They've told me nothing - No sour grapes Why sour grapes? I've no idea That's that What about witesses? Where must I sign? Would you like more candles for the ceremony? No, let the illumination be in their hearts It won't take long, just a simple ceremony Are you ill? - Control yourself - I can't help it Try to pray Don't drink when you're maudlin Why are you crying? The wedding brings back memories All day I've been keyed-up to make any sacrifice The Spaniards haven't done what people said They're supposed to rape and pillage; I've waited all day I'm very emotional Wake up Listen to the silence It torments me most of all. Tell my wife I must speak to her What if I meet the Duke? You won't; his room's on the floor above my wife's I'm staying at your house; lead the way I'm guarding the bier - Listen, son... - No familiarity. Take my monkeys Sit down! Animals in my bed? The Duke's monkeys pay you an undeserved honour Are you comfortable, Coco? We have no further need of you Have you seen my wife? Why hasn't she come? She's deceiving you while you sleep. I saw her I shall be avenged! Do you understand? I'll go through the nursery, onto the connecting balcony And when I tap with my halberd... I rush to the Duke's room to bar his escape - What are you doing here? - It's obvious Have you been feeding the child for the last two hours? You'll wake the house I knew it! I'm disgraced for all to see! - Balcony doors open - It's so hot Murder, lead me on! Down with the Spaniards! Where's my halberd? Duke! We have matters to settle! Forward Go on. If you kill the Duke you'll be hanged If you don't, you'll also be hanged What are you doing, booby? Must I tickle your neck to make you talk? A plot against your life. I've come to defend you Aren't you Flemish? Flemish by birth, but Spanish at heart But there are still bad feelings Even in this house The Mayor has deceived you I thought the boot was on the other foot Don't trust him, he's a knave He was, because he's dead now May he rest in peace Your cowardice got me into trouble, but I smoothed it over Who told you to knock him out? I'll put him out of his misery No, enough of corpses Time to go, Father Milk rolls and chocolate May you be repaid a hundredfold For your charities They who give to the poor, give to God My lamb, keep these indulgences The only genuine indulgences, beware of imitations You've had nothing to drink, Father - Too hot - Keep the bowl Look, the Spaniards are going Spaniards? What Spaniards? I forbid you to make such a spectacle of yourself Don't play for time His Excellency the Duke of Olivieres... ...touched by our welcome to the Spaniards... ...has exempted Boom from taxes for a year It is entirely due to our Mayor's heroism... ...that our town has been so favourably treated Where did the necklace come from? It's Monseigneur's wedding present to Siska He does things in style, your Monseigneur
