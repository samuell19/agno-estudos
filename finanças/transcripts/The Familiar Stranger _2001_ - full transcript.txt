Chris, where's dad? I don't know. Come on. Quit fooling around. Let's go. One second. Chris, I told you ... let's go. Come on. Wait up, Ted. Come on, man. We'll get him. We've gotta find a slug. That's disgusting. Dad? Dad? Ted, where is he? How should I know. Dad! Dad! Dad, come on, quit joking! Dad? Dad! Dad? Boo! Agh! Dad, you jerk! Fine, then, I'm not taking you fishing in the morning. Yes, you are. You said you are! Shh! A bear! A bear right behind you! Hey! Hey! No, not this way! The other way! Quick! Give up while you still can, dad! Watch out! Right behind you! No! I got his hand! Help, mom! Agh! Look over there! Help me up! Help me up! Whose is that? Which Welsh man is this? I got him! I got him! And what do you think of these, mom? They're great! They're beautiful! They really are wonderful. My gosh. You won't believe what happened. What? What? Okay, listen, we're out there in the middle of the lake... And dad lost his sunglasses. He did? 'Cause he was tickling Chris. Yeah, tickling me, scaring the fish. I don't think he scared that many fish. We'll be there in a second! Go get your backpacks, guys. Go ahead. Go ahead. Hurry up! Come on, I've got your cookies here. And, mom, he was gonna jump in. I was like, "you'll never find them." Have a great time! Bye, mom! Bye, mom! Don't forget to say "thank you"! Bye, dad! Bye, dad! Davy Jackson is in the office? No, no, no. I don't want to talk to him. Well, sh... show them whatever they want to see. Hey, you. I've never known you to pass up a chance to go hiking. Well, I just thought they'd ... I thought the boys would want a few hours without US, and the Andersons are going to bring them home by dinner. Patrick Welsh... Patrick hennesy Welsh. That's my name. I like hearing you say it. Come on, Chris. Mom, I don't wanna go home. I know, sweetie. Neither do I. Why do we have to? Well...you have to get back for school. We have to get back to dad's work. Okay? Go get your brother. You did good. Thank you. Don't worry. Go get your brother. Pat? Hey, last one in the car! Rotten egg! Rotten egg! Rotten egg! Rotten egg! I'm in, I'm in, I'm in! I won! I won! Hello? Pat? Pat, is that you? Why aren't you at the club? I was just on my way out. What is it? Where's the gun? What?! We don't have that. We got rid of it. No, no, no! I know it's here somewhere! What is the matter with you? I need to find it. What is the matter? What happened? I quit! What?! I resigned! They said I took money! Pat, that's insane! They said I took money. They want to indict me! They wanna indict me. That ... just sit down. I don't wanna... Sit down, please. Come on! Sit down, pat! Okay, okay... Just breathe. Let's get your dad on the phone. No, no, no! Please! For me. All right? We will get your dad on the phone. Dick, it's peachy. Dick's on his way home. Is something the matter? We just need to speak to you and to dick. Well, I'm glad you're here. I got some good news from the doctor this morning. It appears this round of chemo is doing the trick. Thank god, Anne. I've had to resign from the development fund. Pat, what happened? Well, they ... the university has alleged ... There's a routine internal...Monitoring process, and they said that funds... Are missing. I'm gonna be indicted. That's nonsense! That's exactly what I said. But if there's going to be an indictment, then ... then they must have proof. If the jury can see the exhibit, you may proceed, counselor. Mr. Welsh had a very elaborate system to embezzle university funds. He'd create applications for nonexistent grants, providing these applications in the names of real, though unsuspecting, professors. A check would be issued... He'd forge his or her signature... Cash the check... And pocket the money. And in using this system over a period of time, he was able to embezzle almost $25,000 before it came to the attention of university officials. Everybody makes mistakes ... your dad, too. And he's sorry. Was there a judge there? Yes. A jury? Yes, but they decided daddy can serve his sentence on the weekends. H-He'll do his punishment on the weekends, then after that, it's probation. What's that? Will you shut your fat face?! Ted. Ted... Probation is when you don't have to go to jail, you just have to report in. I know it's weird now, but it's gonna be okay. Did dad do it? Yes. Pat? I couldn't face them. Well, they just wanna know that everything is all right ... it will be all right. I don't know how this got so crazy. We never should've built this house. No, it made sense. It was not just this house. It's everything. I've been spending money like I'm on the same level with everybody we know, and I ... w-we just can't ... I wish you had told me. Why? And then we could've worked it out together. If it takes the rest of my life, peachy, I will be the best husband... ...and father. Pat... I never wanna... Hurt you ... I will never hurt you again. I will ne... I will ... you and the boys are the most important thing in the world to me. I know that. Do you remember when I came up to your dorm and asked you to marry me? Do you? You were coming back from class, and you looked up, and you saw me on the steps. You ... you were so surprised. Yes, I was. And I ... I had a plan where I knew exactly how we could start our lives together and how we could make things work. Well, pat, we can do that. Do you remember? Yes! You'll get another job, and I'll get one, too. We have to get back on our feet together. So they handed me the first challenge of my job. They said, "in this new job, you have to surprise the chief surgeon." It's his 65th birthday. He doesn't want anybody to know how old he is. So nobody surprises him. He's out on stage. He's giving a lecture. I come up behind him with this huge cake. I mean huge ... candles all over it, blazing. He turns around. His eyes go wide. And I think, "that's it. I've got him." And before a moment can go by, he looks at me and goes, "nurse, scalpel." I'm getting a drink. Can I get you one? Some wine, please, yeah. Yeah. Hey, pat, excellent program you did at the hospital. My kid is getting all fired up about going into oncology now. Thanks, Terry. That's great. That's great. Sheila, hi. What a great color. Thanks. So, how is that girl scout drive going? Peachy, I've been meaning to mention that check you guys gave me for the cookies. It came back. Well, I'm sure there was a mistake at the bank. Why don't you just put it through again? I did. You know, I hate to even mention it. Patrick, how are ya? How much was it for? It's, $18. Dad, this is so cool! Good? What, maybe put your beds up there? Mom, check it out! You guys be careful up there! Okay, mom. Pretty good? Very good. The check you gave to Sheila for the cookies bounced. Great... Another crumb for public consumption. She's not gonna say anything. Nobody is saying anything. Hey, dad, look at this! Cool, a fort! Pat, are we in trouble? I would tell you if we were. No, we're fine now. We're fine. I'll write another check. How strong is that fort? I already gave her the cash. Get away, dad! You keeping me out? Stay down! Don't touch me, dad! Here I come! This is pretty good! You gotta get down! Watch out! No, no! Look what we got under here! Dad, you made it so cool. This thing's strong! I bet it'll last 100 years! Hi, this is Patrick Welsh in the community relations office of Lancaster hospital. I'm either on the other line or away from my desk right now, but if you'll leave your name and number, I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Thanks for calling. Hi, dick, it's peachy. I'm worried about pat. I'm afraid something's happened. I did. I talked to him about 6:00. Great night for being out. Well, he called to say he was stuck at work and he'd try to leave before it got really bad. That was four hours ago. Dick, I'm so worried. Not to worry. Thank you so much. There. I know this is crazy. I'm just really, really worried. Well, maybe we better check out Lincoln road again. He would've come this way. He said he was coming right home. You and the boys better come to our place tonight. I don't want you staying by yourself. Okay. Peachy? I went to the house, and I found this... In the mail slot. "My darling... "You are not only my love, but my life, "and I don't know how to put into words all that I want to express to you." "You deserve a better man than I have become, and I must give you that by ending my...Life." I know that by doing so, I will be releasing you from the misery I've brought you over these past months. Please know that however I do this, it will be final, with no future complications for you. Please tell Ted and Chris that I will always be watching over them from heaven... And that they made me proud to be their father. Peachy, I hope that one day you'll forgive me and understand that I tried every way I could. Know that there was no one on earth I ever loved more... That I'll never stop loving you, even with my final breath. No, no! No! You and the boys have been everything to me. I love you. I'm so sorry I let you down. We talked a couple of times from work during the day, and everything seemed... Normal. Anything stand out in your mind? Any other problems recently? Has he been despondent? Actually, he's just started to feel good about himself. Lieutenant. His car's been located at the bus station in Logan. Is he...? Pat? Just a minute, please. Dick, it's for you. It's the hospital. This is Dr. Welsh. Peachy...we're gonna do everything we can. Mom, what's going on? Well, we're not really sure, but it's dad. Where is dad, anyway? He's upset... And we don't know where he is right now. We better go find him. Boys! I could use your help setting the table for breakfast. Would you go help her? Come on. Come on. Just don't break anything. Hey, Ted, take the ball! Hurry! I got it! I got it! I'm glad you're my sister. I don't know what I'd do if I didn't have you to talk to... Even though it's been almost 2 weeks, and I'm just waiting. I don't know what to do. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. Thank god I have to take the kids to school. What else can you do? You have to do that. Paul... We're gonna make our way back up to the house. We'll be there in a bit! Chris! Good to see you! Bye, aunt Claire! What do the boys say about all this? Well, Chris seems okay, but Ted is getting worried. Pat was behind on his restitution payments to the university. He hadn't made a mortgage payment in months. God... He was in trouble and I didn't know it. Why wasn't I there for him? Come on. Let's get home. The ball, the ball! Pass it here! Pass it here! I got it! That's not fair! Was there anything else in the room? No, just the picture. It was a transient hotel near the bus station. The room was empty except for that ... not even a toothbrush. Police in the bay area spent all last night questioning a homeless man who claims he saw someone jump from the bridge. They're still searching for a body. With the currents in the San Francisco bay, we may never find him. Mom, hey mom! We're home! Let's go out to the treehouse. We're going outside! Boy, we're done for. We're gonna go splat to the ground. I, have to talk to you guys. I-I've got some news. About dad, right? Yes. Did you find dad? Is dad here? No. No, um... You know that a lot of people have been looking for him. A lot of people have been looking for him very hard, and, they found out that he went all the way across the country, to another city, and that's what's taking so long. What city? San Francisco. And, um... Your dad is, he's not coming back. He's not? No, honey. Why is he staying there? Honey, he's not staying there. You know that he's been very...... Your dad just couldn't take it anymore. And so he thought maybe... That it was time for him to go to heaven. You mean dad's dead? Yes. Dad killed himself? I want my dad. I want my dad! I know you do, sweetheart. I want dad. I'm so sorry. You have to remember how much he loved you. He loved you both. He loved you both so much ... how he could always make you laugh. He built this place for you. He loved you both... So much. And I love you. All the fun that we had together. Baby...Come here. I know. I love you both so much. Mom, why can't Sadie move with US? I told you. The landlord doesn't allow big dogs in these apartments. She'll be okay where she's going. She'll be happier there. Why can't she move with US? Are you gonna fight? Come on. Get in the car. Here's the collar... ...bowl, okay? Okay. Right. Come on, Sadie. Nice lady. Sadie. Okay? Nice lady. Give it a couple of days. Here we go. Mom, I don't want to stay here. It's not so bad. Come on, honey. Okay, get Goldie. Nice and easy. Just keep your eye on that traffic, sweetie. This place sucks. Last one in's a... Rotten egg! Rotten egg! Rotten egg! Rotten egg! Ted's last! Is he? No. Chris. Ted is. You are definitely a rotten egg. I'm not! Yeah, you are! Come here, you. Ted and I used to do this when we were little, didn't we? Yes, you did. Yes, first Ted, and then we got him out. And then we finally got you out. Was dad there when I was born? He sure was. He helped to deliver you. My gosh! And when you got bigger, he used to make your baby food. He'd mix it up in the blender. Dad cooked? Yeah. He was a major good cook. Remember your birthdays? Yeah. That's right. When you were upset, he'd lie down on the bed with you. He just had a magic touch. He would calm you... While I cooked. A new school and a new start may not be such an awful thing for them. I didn't have much choice. I can't afford to keep them at Saint Mary's. I don't know how I'm gonna do this... And not let them see it. I have $23 in the bank and all of this debt. Let me give you something to tide you over. Paul and I have been talking. Peachy, you know that you can always come to US. I know that, and I do appreciate it. Dick and Anne, too. No, they keep offering, but dick has got all those medical bills, and I... You'll find a job. Well, I hope so. I don't ... look at these ... all of these jobs have qualifications. See, I don't have qualifications. You know, when I was first married, I took that job at the library. I just handed my check over to him. I don't even know what he did with the money. I should have known. I should've made it my business. I should've been more interested in finances. I used to call you sleeping beauty. Yeah, well, now... I am wide awake. Tell the mayor if he doesn't show up at the lunch, he won't get his picture in the paper. What was I saying? Attracting businesses to the area is a major part of what the chamber of commerce does ... assisting them, coordinating their moves. I just don't see the kind of qualifications ... ...i was a junior ... I'm just three credits short, and I always mean to go back and finish. Right. Well, I'm gonna hang on to your application, and if anything materializes, I'll let you know. I need this job. I really ... I need this job. I have ... I have two...Little boys. Elizabeth, what we're looking for is someone who has a business and marketing background. I have that. For the last 10 or 12 years I have been doing that. The volunteer work with the literacy program, and all the functions and the meetings I have organized at the club. Also, I care very deeply about the economic development of this community. I have lived here my whole life... And now I'm raising two boys here. All I'm asking is a chance. Give me a chance. Okay. Let's do it. Yeah? Great! Let's give it two months and see what happens. Yes! Thank you! Thank you. Thank you very much. Whoa! There we go! How's Ted doing at school? Hit and miss. Better. I haven't told anyone else in the family yet, but I want you to know, dear. I had some tests. They weren't so good. I'm not going through another round of chemo. Dick and I decided together. Well...whatever happens, whatever you need, I'll be here. I'll be here. Look at all the leaves you left around there. What is that? Have a good day. I love you. Have a good day! Okay. Okay. I'll see you later! Bye! Careful there, little buddy! Wh-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-a! Oomph! Mom! How was school? All right. Hi, I'm home. Hi, mom. Let's go. I need new gym shoes. Yeah, I know. I'll get them on the weekend. So, how was grandma? This was not one of her better days. Mom, my play's on Thursday. Are you coming? Chris... Mom, I'm the main pilgrim. I know. What time is it? 11:00. I don't really see how I can get out of work. I...don't know how to do that. What ... were you planning on handing this in? It's a mess. You're gonna have to recopy it. Now, listen, guys... I am tired of coming home and having to nag you guys to help out around here! Look at this place! Ted, you need to change your shirt. That one's dirty. No, it's not! Ted, come on! I'm not leaving the house... What are you doing, Ted? I've had just about enough of her on my back all the time! Hey! Recopy your homework so we can go meet grandpa for dinner. Your father would be so ashamed of you acting this way. Do you know how sick I am of hearing that?! Hey! Get back here! Pat was "fun daddy," and now all they have is me, the mother from hell. Come on. That's not true. You're a great mom. You're just juggling a lot, you know, with your job... And Anne being sick. Claire, it's the housing on the transmission. By the way... How is she? Have they given dick any idea how long? No, we know that she is dying, we just don't know when. I was thinking, I was exactly Ted's age when mom got sick. Yeah, I was probably about Chris'. I don't remember that time so much though. Well, I do... And I hate it that my sons are reliving my childhood. Peachy, it's hardly our childhood. Well, we had to fend for ourselves without mom, and that's what they have to do. I'm just not there enough for them, and there's nothing I can do about it. Was dad strong? Here... When he was in school, all the girls loved him. Everybody did. He was an extraordinary young man. You should be very proud of him. He loved you both very much. Was this the new year's Eve party? The one where I embarrassed your father. Tell US again, grandma. Well, it was too quiet for a party, so I took your father to the center of the floor... And then... I started to sing. You know what song? ♪ Let me call you sweetheart ♪ I'm in love with you ♪ let me hear you whisper ♪ that you love me, too ♪ keep the lovelight glowing ♪ in your eyes so true ♪ let me call you sweetheart ♪ I'm in love with you Unto almighty god we commend the soul of our sister departed. And we commit her body to the ground, earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust, in sure and certain hope of the resurrection unto eternal life, through our lord Jesus Christ, at whose coming in glorious majesty to judge the world, the earth and sea shall give up their dead and the corruptible bodies of those who sleep in him shall be changed and made like unto his own glorious body, according to the mighty working whereby he is able to subdue all things unto himself. And... And... Let US pray. Okay. Mom, my feet hurt in these shoes. I know. I know. Ted? Mom, can I have some soda? Um, after you hang up your good clothes, okay? Ted? Hey, aunt Claire. Hey, Chris. Hey, uncle Paul. Hey. Hi, peachy. Thanks for coming. Any news? No. They have searched everywhere for him. Come on, buddy. Let's go see how that fish of yours is doing. This is my fault. It can't be. I'm sure he's all right. He was upset. I found this in his room. It's the letter pat wrote to me. It's his suicide letter. How did he get this? He got it out of my drawer. I don't even know how long he's had it. I'm gonna put it back where I found it. It's some sort of connection for him. He just needs it. Hey...we'll find him. We will. Sweetie. 7220. Ted! You called the police?! Where were you? In Logan. You went all the way to Logan?! You didn't tell me. Why'd you call the police? What are ... Ted! Wh... wh... what were you doing? Where did you stay last night? With Jimmy Vaughn. I don't know what the big deal is. You most certainly do know what the big deal is. Disappearance is a very powerful weapon, and you, of all people, should know that. You are a member of this family. Each member has a responsibility to the other one. It's you and me and Chris ... that's it. That's all we've got. I can take just about anything in this world except losing one of you. Ted, I ju... That's right. Phase 2 will quadruple their facility. It'll be a huge infusion of money into the local economy. It will be a massive open house. Manufacturers from all over the world will be attending. Well, that's it, then. Thank you, Derek. Bye. Elizabeth... I really have to go. Chris is moving out today. I promised I would help. Bill's on line one. Thank you. Hello. When did you get in? I'm impressed! Hey, mom. You're late. Ted, you are such a good brother. Yeah. Hi, honey. Mom, your timing's perfect. This is the last of it. I had to circle the block three times before you finished. At least he's not moving in with me. I don't know how to tell you this, Ted, but, your place ... it's a health hazard. Yeah... This is mine. I don't want you to go! Mom, don't make a big deal, okay? Well, I know it's time. For you, too. I'll only be 12 blocks away. Gotta go to work. So rude. Bye, mom. Bye. Well, he's been holding down two jobs, and he's the head of the finance club at college. He's graduating from college this year, so I'm more than confident that he can handle his own place. You're gonna miss him. Yeah. We've been like roommates these last couple of years. He leaves the porch light on for me, I leave it on for him... Well...chris and I love coming here. It's such a kick to see Ted running this place. I wish he was here now. It must be great. I'm babbling on about my kids. No, no, no. Don't be silly. They seem like great guys. They are. It amazes me... And I'm really, really proud of them. I'm glad you suggested that we come here. Yeah? If I could just get you to come visit me in Santa fe. Yeah. My boss is starting to wonder why I keep volunteering to head up all these training sessions here. I really like spending time with you, Elizabeth. Can I talk you into that? That would be very nice. I think I could! I don't think it'd be a problem. Thank you. I had a wonderful time. So did I. Get out of here. Yeah, I'll call you when I get to the office. Okay. Okay. You miss me already, don't you? Get out of here! What? So I'll see you in about 10 minutes, okay? Linda! Linda berg! Hey, Elizabeth. I've got something for you. I'm so sorry to bother you. I know how busy you are, but I need your advice. The president of the chamber of commerce needs advice from me? Yes. What? No. This is a mistake. Yeah, it's gotta be somebody who assumed his number... Or it's a clerical screw-up. That's what I was thinking, but why would a number that hasn't been active for so many years suddenly spring to life? Now, Elizabeth, you know this isn't your husband, right? Yes, of course, but it is unsettling. I've been on the phone trying to get a person ... a human voice ... at social security...Forever, and I'm not getting anywhere. Let me give chip carney a call. He's a friend of mine over there. If anybody can get to the bottom of this, chip can. I wish I could help you, Mrs. Welsh. I'm sorry. What am I supposed to do? As I told Linda, once you make a request for review, I'd be glad to personally attend to it. But with our rules of confidentiality ... I know about that. We aren't able to give more information than what you've already received. The information I have received doesn't make any sense! Okay. Thank you very much. Excuse me. I'm not asking you to break any rules or for any special treatment. Well, I guess I am. My sons and I are being asked to repay an awful lot of money, and it's not that much money if you spread it over 10 years and you throw in college tuition, but it's a lot of money to have to pay, and it's not just that the money is the issue. My husband is dead. My sons were little when he took his life... And we had to live through that once. Now, because of some gigantic mistake, you're asking US to go through that again, and after everything we have been through, I deserve an answer. Let me get you some water. I don't want any water. Let me... Get you some water. "The number holder is under investigation "for another crime ... in Maine"? "This man's wife and children were paid survivor benefits and he is" ... "and he is not dead but very much alive." Thanks for helping me out, Linda. I can't believe we can do this. It's the information age. With a social security number and the right web site, you can find anything. Here it is! They have a driver's license database, and there's Maine. This is the number you want to call. I'm gonna call them, Linda. Hello. Database. Hi, I was looking at your web site, and I wanted to match a social security number with a person. What's the number? 998-91-1591. One moment...Ready? Yeah. Patrick hennesy Welsh. 6'3." 185 pounds. Green eyes. Brown hair. Must wear glasses to drive. 282 armitage road, kennebunkport, Maine. Um, thank you. You're welcome. What? That's him. It's pat! Hello? Elizabeth? It's Linda. I tried you at home. Are you all right? Yeah. I'm fine. I just lost track of time. Hey, I found something interesting. I called my guy at the university, and he pulled the file on the embezzlement case. He says there were payments against the debt for the first couple of months, then nothing. Right. Well, pat was dead. Well, somebody paid off the whole thing a little over a year ago. What?! Who paid it? He said it was anonymous ... over $10,000. Why would anyone pay off Patrick Welsh's debt? I don't know. "Timothy Michael kingsbury." Good morning! Wjnp. Good morning. Is Tim kingsbury there, please? This is Tim. Pat? You must have the wrong number. He and this woman he is either living with or married to are all over the paper. He's saving a historic building there. He's hosting a black-tie gala here. The local gossip columnist even called him "the amazing Tim kingsbury." These are from the column that he wrote himself. "Tim trains for a marathon." "Tim goes on a date." This is the woman ... Sharon baker. How on earth did you get this? The university web site. She's the director of the development fund. I-I just can't get over the fact that you've done all this. I mean, i-I've ... I called him. You did what? I couldn't help it. What did he say? He said I had the wrong number. Did it sound like pat Welsh? No...see, I don't know. I'm not sure. No, it can't be pat Welsh. There's no way! Come on, peachy, if it were pat Welsh ... if he were alive and living with another woman, she'd be 22. What do the boys say about all of this? They don't know, and I haven't told them. And I'm not going to, at least not now. They have been through enough. And I have decided... That I am gonna go there. You most certainly are not. Yeah, I have to see this with my own eyes. See what? Tim kingsbury? I thought you'd understand, Claire. I have to find out about this! You have to leave this to people who know what they're doing. You don't, peachy! I thought you'd understand. I'm going. Okay, then I'm going with you. No, you're not. I have to do it alone. There are things I can find out there. What things? What can you find out? The social security file said that he was being investigated for another crime. Those are public records. I could find those. Claire. I'm not going to do anything stupid! I'm not going to take any chances! But I have to find out about this! What is he doing up there? Going through some old clothes. I want you to go through my marketing project. I think it's pretty good. I would love to. I would love to. Watch that, will you? Hello? Hi, bill. No, no. It's fine. We were just having a little celebration. Ted made manager. ...you're not. No. Yeah, yeah, I do want to come... There, but I ... right. Okay. Bye. And how was bill? Well, he seemed fine. You gonna go down there? I don't know. But... I thought you liked him. I...like him fine. You got trust issues, mom. Well...thank you, Chris. No problem. Hey, this will work for the party? What's the matter, mom? I remember your father in that tuxedo. And you look very handsome. I think you look like a lounge singer, but, that's just me. Guys, let's celebrate? Happy job, Ted. Thanks! Hear! Hear! Cheers. Thanks. Well... Um, I have to tell you guys... I'm gonna go away for a few days. With bill? Where you going? I'm going to Maine. Maine? On business? Well, kinda. By yourself? Yes. You think you could mind your business a bit? Do I keep tabs on you? I don't think so. You know, you really do look like a lounge singer. Yeah? ♪ Let me call you sweetheart ♪ ♪ I'm in love with you Grandma sang that! ♪ Let me hear you whisper ♪ that you love me, too ♪ keep the lovelight burning ♪ in your eyes so true ♪ let me call you sweetheart ♪ I'm in love with y-o-o-o-ou Maybe we can find it in the tourist information, honey. Excuse me. Can I help you? Yes, please. I'd like some information about a criminal case within the last year. It involves Timothy kingsbury. You say it would be a criminal case? I believe so, yes. No, I don't find any cases concerning a Timothy kingsbury. Are you sure it's "kingsbury"? Um...could you try "Patrick h. Welsh"? W-e-l-s-h. Here it is. Thank you. Full service. Claire? I found him. Wait ... what? I found out why he had to start using his old social security number again. He forged a birth certificate. Somebody found out, pressed charges, and they convicted him. Listen, I'm getting on a plane. No, no. It's fine. I'm fine. Mr. Dusak? That's me. How can I help you? My name is Elizabeth Welsh. Yes, Ms. Welsh? I used to be married to Patrick Welsh... Or Tim kingsbury. You were his probation officer? Yes, I was. He told me he'd been paying child support and his family didn't want anything to do with him. And you believed that? I believed every word he said. He always had that effect on people. When the charges were filed, Tim turned himself in and confessed his real identity. He said he had an unhappy life back in Ohio... And that when he'd come here, he started calling himself Tim kingsbury so he could get a clean start. And now this ... what you're telling me... I read the records here. How did that happen? How did he get away with it? He really didn't. He pled guilty, received a fine...Probation. Agh... The judge told him he could go on being Tim kingsbury in public, though he had to use his real name on all legal records. Like social security. Exactly. One condition of the probation was that he had to repay what he owed the university in Ohio, which I know he did. He also had to go to the social security office and identify himself. That's how I got the letter. Look... Tim kingsbury's like this... Legend around here. People think he's a remarkable individual. Man of the hour! Hi! Hey! Hi. Hey, Tim. How are you? How you doing? You know, for the last decade, I've had a very intense... And personal relationship with this organization. The work that Sharon and I have done over the years with the heritage charities, a women's crisis center, the boy scouts, the preservation society, have given me a past, a present, and a future that I'm very proud of. And I'm honored by this recognition that you've given me today, so thank you very much. Congratulations! Congrats, Tim! Congratulations! Great job, Tim! Thank you, Tim. Peachy. I always knew this was going to happen someday. I never thought you were going to be the one to find me. How did you? Social security sent me a letter. They want back survivor benefits Ted and Chris collected. Peachy... God, you look ... it's so good to see you. It's almost $60,000, pat... And they want it now. Leaving was the best thing I could do for you. No, it was the best thing you could do foryou. You didn't just leave me. You left Chris and Ted. It was the best thing you could do for you. I couldn't take being... That person that brought so much shame on you. I lost our home. I had to sell everything ... everything that we had ... move Ted and Chris into this awful apartment. I had to give away Sadie. It... I'm so sorry. What in the world did you think you were doing? I went crazy that day. No! You left and you came here and got the lay of the land and found out who's who, and presto, the amazing Tim kingsbury is born! You just don't know. No. No, I don't. And, um... Who is Sharon baker? She's the woman I'm living with. You married? No. Do you have children? No children. Good. I wouldn't want them hurt the way your sons were hurt. You haven't even asked about them. Ted and Chris? They were so little and innocent when you left. They adored you. You were a god to them. Do you even know that your mother died? No, I didn't know. And you let her die believing that you had committed suicide. So...wh... so, what now? You want... You gonna have me arrested? I really have no interest in seeing you in jail. I want you to contact social security about repayment. And then you can lay around and die as the biggest deal in kennebunkport, and I will leave you alone. I don't have that kind of money... Or...any money, for that matter. You never looked back, did you?! Did mom call you? Yeah. When? A few minutes ago. Hi. Why don't you sit down? A few weeks ago I received a notice from social security ... a letter saying that the survivor benefits you guys received had to be repaid. And the reason they gave was that the number holder was not deceased ... that Patrick hennesy Welsh was alive. Somebody's got dad's social security number. That's what I thought at first. Mom. Through his social security number, I tracked him down... ...and I saw him. It's not somebody else. It's him. It is your father. Dad? You saw dad? Yes. That's why you went to Maine? Wait a minute. You went to find dad? You didn't even tell US? I wasn't sure, and I had to be sure. He has been there all of this time. He ... living under another name ... Tim... Kingsbury. Timothy Michael kingsbury. Ted, hold on a minute. Look...i know it's really weird, but... It's gonna be okay, all right? I just can't talk to her right now. I know, I know.... But you gonna give me a call later ... we'll figure it out? All right. It'll be okay. Ted's feeling kind of weird right now. Yeah, well... I didn't know what to do. I mean, if it was him, if it wasn't him ... I didn't want to be the one to make you dredge up all of those feelings. Yeah, but you still should have told US. I'm sorry. I hardly remember the guy. What I remember most is just what you and grandma told US. But I mean... For Ted, it's different. I know that. Ted takes things to heart. I know he does. Well, anyway, I gotta go. I got exams. Chris, we have to talk about what you guys want to do. Frankly, I don't need to do anything. He says he doesn't have the money, and I can't pay it back, so I'm willing to try something else. Like what? I could go to the d.A. And have him file charges against your father... If that's something you're comfortable with. I can't speak for Ted, but...Yeah. I'm comfortable with that. I was only trying to protect you. You can't do that. You know, you have this thing about telling US what you think we need to know. Just try telling US the truth. Well, I wasn't trying to deceive you. Ted? From the moment he was gone, you made him perfect ... the perfect dad. I wanted you to have a father that you could be proud of. Why couldn't you have just left it and let US have the father that we had? What do you want me to say? You don't need my permission to do this. This concerns the three of US. Nail him. Mrs. Welsh? Can I just get a statement, just real quick? Not now. Hi. Hi. This is kind of...Amazing. I don't know. There he is! Is he coming in? Yeah. Yeah, he's coming out. Patrick? Mr. Welsh! What made you think you could get away with it? Mr. Welsh? Patrick? Have you talked to your kids at all? How are you gonna plead? Mr. Welsh? Can I get a comment? Do you have anything you want to say? Anything at all? Your honor, we enter "not guilty" pleas on each count of the indictment. With regard to bond, Mr. Weiner, is there anything you wish to say? Yes, your honor. Sharon baker ... close personal friend of Mr. Welsh ... is here to offer herself as personal custodian to Mr. Welsh. She is here to assure that any condition placed upon the court upon Mr. Welsh's release will be adhered to. I would add that he is a pillar in his community. There is absolutely no evidence to indicate that he would be a danger to the community. It is for these reasons that I respectfully request a bond in reasonable amount. Thank you, your honor. Thank you, Mr. Weiner. Mr. Becker? Your honor, whether he is a pillar of his community there is a matter of opinion ... skipping out on parole once before, changing his identity, remaining gone for 10 years. His track record is adequate reason for this court to set bond in the amount of $500,000. Bond is set in the amount of $300,000. You may go with the bailiff. The d.A. Says that the bond is too high for Sharon baker to commit to. Your dad's gonna have to stay in jail. ...Abandoned his family and left a note saying he was going to kill himself. Instead, he ran off to Maine and fashioned a new life. Today Welsh pleaded "not guilty" in a licking county courtroom to felony charges for "nonsupport of dependents" and "complicity to theft." In 1988, Welsh was found guilty of embezzling money from the university where he worked as a fundraiser. He was on probation when he fled from Ohio, leaving behind his wife and two sons, 12 and 9. Following another conviction of forgery just this past year in kennebunkport... Hello? ...using his real social security number. This is she. ...his former wife, learned that her husband was still alive... Yes. Good day. ...the social security administration seeking repayment for the money paid to her sons... That was your father's attorney. ...Mrs. Welsh told reporters... Your father wants to see you. ...should her former husband have to spend time in jail. The big lesson here, she said, is that no one should walk away from their family. You came. That's good. Will the boys be here? In a bit, yes. Good! I-I didn't know how you'd feel about that. Well, they're grown men. They make their own decisions, but it is why I'm here. Your sons are coming to see their father. And I just want to reestablish a relationship with them if I can. That's the... That's the only thing that matters to me. Don't sit there and play with their feelings. Don't you dare. They're coming to see their father. You have to be conscious of that. Think of that. I'll keep it in mind. You have to admit now, the two of US did better apart than we ever did together. What changed? Our whole life together... Did you ever love me? Were we ever in love? I'm going to wait here for you ... I'm going to wait here for you. Mom, we're big boys now. Well, I know that. I want to protect you. I know. We're fine, okay? Okay. Okay. Son... I'm so glad you came. I'm ... this means a lot. This means a lot, and I have a lot of things I want to say to you boys. I know you have questions. Why the hell did you leave? W... I th... I thought it was best. That's not an answer. You w... I think I deserve an answer. I was 11 years old. This is what you left US with. Remember this? I'm ... I'm sorry. Let's not ... "my darling, you are not only my love, but my life. "I don't know how to put into words all I want to express to you." Son. "You deserve a better man than I have become. I must give you that by ending my life." Son... I'm sorry, son. "Please tell Ted and Chris "that I will always be watching over them "from heaven. They've made me proud to be their father"! Son, i-I've ... we were about to lose everything ... our car, our house ... how could that matter more than our family?! No ... i... please, forgive me. How could that matter?! Son ... you have no right to say that to me!! Son, I love you. You have no right!! Son, listen to me ... son? Ted. I don't know... What I expected. I guess... ...this instant bond or something. I'm done with the guy. I remember throwing a football to him when I was 7. That time I fell off the back of the golf cart ... you guys kept driving on and came back and I was standing there. Do you remember that? Some parts, yeah. Jogging, um ... I remember jogging. I wonder if our treehouse is still there. He was a cool dad to have. The court's been informed that the defendant wishes to change his plea today from that of "not guilty" to "no contest." Mr. Welsh, do you understand that by entering pleas of "no contest," you are giving up your right to have a trial by jury or a trial by the court? Yes, your honor. Do you understand that you are giving up your right to require your accusers to appear before you and to confront you with the evidence they have? I do, your honor. And do you understand that you are giving up your right to cross-examine your accusers? Yes, your honor. Mr. Welsh, in the event I find you guilty, the only thing that remains to be done is to pass sentence. That sentence could include a period of years in a state penal institution. Do you understand that? Yes, your honor. This court finds the defendant guilty as charged of all counts as filed in the indictment. Those counts being "felony nonsupport of dependants" and "complicity to theft." We will reconvene on the 21st of the month at 8:00 A.M. for sentencing. Is she awake yet? Yeah, just ... she'll be here in a minute. I stopped off and got some real maple syrup. We can heat it up. Just like at chez Teddy. Yeah. Quit eating the croissants. I'm hungry. Did you write your letter yet? What letter? You know, the one for the sentencing hearing. They said that we could, write a letter or make a statement. Yeah, and say what ... 30 to life and hard labor? I think I'm gonna pass on that. It's that easy for you? You just shrug it off? Drop it, okay, Ted? No, I mean it. I mean... It's easier to deny the whole thing than to deal with it? It sucks, but I'm dealing with it, all right? Then say that! That is nobody's business, man! You know what? I'm so sick and tired of all this! I'm not going to tell them how much time to give my father. Guys, how nice! Yeah, happy birthday. Hey... How do you feel? I'm okay. Ted's right behind US. I'm just waiting for everybody. Hi, mom. Hi. Will your brother be coming? I don't know what his problem is. That's fine. I'm awfully glad you're here, though. The state of Ohio vs Patrick hennesy Welsh. The honorable judge Ross presiding. Mr. Welsh, is there anything you wish to say before the court pronounces sentence? Yes, your honor. You may proceed. This is not intended to influence your decision today. It's something I need to say to my family. Because of what I've done, you may never know how much I've loved you or how much I ... I've missed you. Ted and Chris... I love you deeply. I really do. Peachy, I'm sorry... And I hope to god ... I pray to god ... to give you the understanding that not all crime is committed out of hate. Sometimes there's fear... And even love. And ... and I'm sorry for what I've done. And i'm...I'm ready to continue with the, punishment. Mr. Welsh, do you understand that ... your honor, sir? I'm sorry, but may I say something, too, please? My name is Christopher Welsh. Come forward, Mr. Welsh. Your honor, over the past couple of months, a major question that everyone's asked is "why?" "Why do you think your father did this?" I'm sure everybody thinks that that's the most important question. For me it's not "why?," it's "how?" How can a father turn his back on a family that loves him? How can a father in one breath say he loves somebody and then turn and run? How can he...For 10 years? How can he not once pick up the phone and call his sons to say hello?! How can he look me in the eye right now? Everything that I've accomplished ... Your honor, what I came here to tell you in this court today, that my mother ... what a wonderful mother my brother and I have. Everything I've accomplished is because of her. I couldn't have asked for anything more in a mom and a dad... And she has been both. My brother, Ted, and I feel very lucky. That's what I wanted to say. Thank you, sir. The defendant will please rise. Mr. Welsh... I have read the reports, the sentencing memoranda... And I am convinced that you are amoral with no conscience. You left a wife and two great sons ... a family that many people would wish and pray for. Your acts were cowardly, and they were criminal. This court sentences you to 4 years to be served at the rockway correctional center. You are ordered to pay full restitution to social security and the Northwestern mutual insurance company. And sir, you will pay every penny of that. You may go with the bailiff now. Court is adjourned. It's over. ...i guess I thought it would feel different. I think that's the way it's gonna be, mom. Well... I just... Have been hoping ... I still hope that the pieces will come together in some way that means something. That might not happen. We may never know. We've been living with this thing for so long. What we know now is that he's alive, living, and we know where he is. For the next 48 months, give or take. Yeah, we're not doing that badly. We're here... Getting a free meal. Don't push it. To our family. Yes. To our family. I thought it was good. They didn't talk too long. Smile, graduate! He's back. Put your cap on. Move, you guys! Move? Thank you, Paul. Thank you. See ya! He's crazy! He's nuts. I love those two. I have loved them when they were babies, and now they are young men. I am very proud of them. Indeed. You're not getting out of it that easy. Who wants to, you big, handsome graduate? I need you guys to check the house for me next week. You know, bring in the mail, make sure everything's okay, 'cause I'm going on a little trip. Mom? A little trip? Yes, only this time it's with me. Hey, that's great! Where you guys going? Your mother is finally coming out for a little visit. You're going to new Mexico? Yes. Yeah. Look at the camera, everybody! Smiling ... there you go! Turn around! Give me that! You have to keep it still. Keep it still. You're awfully smart with this thing, you know? Yeah, I know. You can take that off now. You're done. I love you guys. captions paid for by lifetime television
