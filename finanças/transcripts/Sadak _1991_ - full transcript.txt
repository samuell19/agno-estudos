THE ROAD What's the fare? Fifty rupees. Sir, you gave me 100 rupees mistakenly. OK! Thank you. Ravi, are you using soda to freshen up? Are you up for a night shift again? Why don't you take a break? Driving round the clock will kill you. What can I do if I can't sleep? Mumbai is full of weirdos, no one sleeps! Mister, will you take me to Kalapool Teenbatti? Sure. - One won't do. - Take it, pal! - Pakya! - Hold on. Why is everyone huddled over there? Ravi, we have a bride! Bride? I didn't see any bandwagon or procession! So how come we have a bride? - Gotya got married! - What? Here is my friend, Ravi! My pal! Ravi! I was looking for you. - Congratulations! - Come over here. Thank you. What's up, Pakya? So this is the bride? Gotya, you haven't got a place to stay. Where will you keep her? Pakya, ever since I was born, I've spent my life on this road and this pavement. It has raised us so far. - That's true. - But now you have a wife. So what? God blessed me with a bride, so He'll grant me a home. - Isn't that right, Ravi? - Right, pal! We don't have a place to live. Nor a bed to sleep. We don't have a place to live. Nor a bed to sleep. But all we have is God. So far He has raised us. We don't have a place to live. Nor a bed to sleep. We don't have a place to live. Nor a bed to sleep. But all we have is God. So far God has raised us. We spend our lives on pavements. We can't dream of mansions and luxury. This road seems to be like our guardian. We are oblivious to all relations. All we have is this dark night with us. All we have is this dark night with us. We are deprived of all hopes. So far God has raised us. What kind of nation do we live in? Why do people remember us after we die? This is the world Where the blind and deaf live. Every one of them is helpless. Who will pay us a heed? But we will endure and live on. We will drink. But we will endure and live on. We will drink. This life is a goblet of venom. So far God has raised us. We don't have a place to live. Nor a bed to sleep. We don't have a place to live. Nor a bed to sleep. But all we have is God. So far God has raised us. But all we have is God. So far God has raised us. Congratulations, Gotya! Gotya. Why did your wife take off her mangalsutra and vermilion? Yes Ravi, it's true. We are not married yet. But we definitely want to get married. It's still an incomplete dream, which we'll fulfill someday. If you can pretend to be married, why don't you get married? Tell me, Gotya! What's your problem? Tell me! Get out. Come on, tell me. Why don't you speak? Shall I tell you why? Because she is a prostitute! And those people will never allow us to get married, Ravi! I haven't got enough money to buy her off! Gotya, why don't you both run away? It's not that easy, Ravi! They are very powerful! And it's also true I am equally weak! People say this is a city of dreams. Will our dreams ever come true? Can a prostitute ever get married? Your dreams will be fulfilled. My heart says so. Your dreams will be fulfilled for sure. Gotya, let's go. People say this is a city of dreams. Will our dreams ever come true? Can a prostitute ever get married? Brother! Save me. Hey, girl, are you crazy? Why are you standing in the middle of the road at night? My birds have gone crazy, not me. Look at them. I let them go, but they just won't budge! I know why they don't want to leave. Why is that? Because this city is very dangerous! If they fly out, vultures and hawks will eat them. They will be killed. So what should I do with them? My uncle is going to take me somewhere and I can't take them along. Give them to me. Will you take care of them? Sure. - Properly? - Yes. Pooja, where are you? Take this. Do you know? You're the first person in this city I'm not scared of! Hurry! Come on. Let them get in! Come in. Over there! - What's up? - We've been called. - Who called you? - Hey! Hey, girl! Over there! Sit down! Open the gate. I want to go out. Hey, come over here! Sit down! I go berserk when you look at me I go berserk when you look at me. You drive me crazy, baby. Nature is great! What a beauty! Nature has done wonders with you. Look, I got goose bumps! I almost had a heart attack. So fair! And look at her body! Don't you be afraid of me, love! Don't you be afraid! I won't harm you! I really can't harm you! Do you know why? Because I am a eunuch! Just look at me! I am just a poor, ugly creature. Look at the cruel joke of fate! All I have is brains. And I can be so damn smart. That's why I provide services to men and I force women to serve them! King of this domain. King of flesh trade! And my name is Maharani! What's going on, uncle? - Let's get out of here. - Let me tell you. It's all fate. We call it destiny! Your dad and your uncle have borrowed from me for your grandpa's treatment. And they kept you as a security. Do you know about security? Then say it loudly! Why are you so shy? But he couldn't even pay me a dime for so many years! So I brought Bansi's daughter here! Today, he has come here to rescue his daughter. What can he do? He hasn't got a penny to repay me! So he brought you here. From now on, you'll stay here. In this brothel. Instead of his daughter. No, uncle, you can't do that! I am your niece. This is all about relations! When your neck is on the line, you really don't care about relations. Poor Bansi hasn't got a choice, has he? You are his niece, but she's his daughter. He has taken the right decision for his daughter. Your fate has brought you here. Nothing can be done now. Nothing! Got that? I will make you a high class slut! I can guarantee you that. Take me away from here! Uncle, you can't do this with me! Please forgive me! Forgive me! - Forgive me! - Don't create a scene! Bansi! Get away from here! Get going! Come on. Uncle! Don't leave me here! Crying won't help you. Don't leave me here! OK, OK. - Juhu? - Please get in. Sir, a few days back, I saw your photo in the newspaper. You got an award. Yes. You are right. Your photo was in The Times of India and there was an article about you in Illustrated Weekly. Yes, sir. It seems you are an educated man. So, why become a cabbie then? It's a long story. I am looking for someone. May I help you? So who are you looking for? It's just a face. A hazy memory. Not sure if I'll see that person again. Pull over. - Here. - No fare for you, sir. - Keep it. - No, sir. OK. If ever you need my help, I live over here. - See you. - OK, sir. Hi, Ravi! Were you up all night? Yes. Just hold this cage for a while. - David! - Yes. - Get a cup of tea upstairs. - Sure. Right away! Ravi! Consume poison if you want to die, not tea. What's wrong, Salim? You've been driving this cab for the last 40 hours! Do you wish to die? What else will I do to make a living? Whenever I close my eyes, all I remember is that terrible incident! Then I can't sleep. Why don't you take medicine? You're going to go crazy. You'll need a shock treatment! Got it? I can't forget my sister. I just can't, Salim. What can I do? I can see her every moment of my life! Ravi, it's been seven years since she died. You must get over it now. You can't let memories of the dead smother you. - Right? - Ravi! Look what they have done to him. What happened to him? Last night three goons beat him up and drove off with his cab! - Where did this happen? - Near Colaba bus station. Salim, take him to the hospital. I'll be right back. - Let's go, Pakya. - Come on. Come on. Come on. Smarty-pants, what are you looking at? Buzz off. I want some stuff for my cab. Then go to a shop! What are you doing here? I want to buy a stolen one! Are you a cop? Pakya, he thinks I am a cop! And does he think I am a constable? A cripple constable! Come on! Dude, you can get everything in here! - Really? - Take your pick, buddy. Sure. How much for this one? Tires are worth ten grand. An engine will cost you eight. The frame is about twelve grand. So the whole comes out to 40. For you, I will slash it to thirty-eight! Do you want it? Thirty-eight? Ten! Plus five is fifteen! - And then five more. - Hey, what are you up to? Wait, don't disturb me when I am counting! Twenty. And then thirty! I want thirty-eight thousand, OK? What are you doing? Thirty-eight thousand? Boy, I don't have that much money! Jerk, what are you doing here? Just get lost! Can I suggest something? I will take this cab for free. Because this cab belongs to someone I know. Are you crazy or something? - Are you crazy? - Yes, I am crazy! You wanna see? I am a punk! Wanna see? Don't move or else I will shoot you! Pakya! - I will shoot you! - Get the cab! - I will shoot you! - Shut up! - Get the cab! - I will shoot you! - He can't do it! Get the cab! - I will do it! - Get the cab! - Don't do it! I will shoot him! He will kill you! - I will shoot you! - Will you? - Yes, I will shoot you! - Then shoot me! - You want to shoot me? Go ahead. - Yes! Come on, shoot me! Come on. You beat him up, didn't you? You beat him up, didn't you? No, Ravi! Stop it! God knows why you were born in our family! I will beat you up! Rupa is not in the room! - I think she ran away! - Take off your shoes! Grandpa! Grandpa! It's a telegram! We found her after two years. She is in Mumbai, grandpa. And she is in a hospital. Let's go to Mumbai and bring her back. - Right? - OK. Where is ward number 13? This way. I will kill you! You can't keep me in here! I am getting out of here! No! No! I am getting out of here! - I'm leaving. - Rupa! Rupa! No! No! - Please take me away from here! - Rupa! Rupa! Rupa, I am Ravi. Your brother, Ravi. - Ravi! - Yes. Ravi! Don't touch me, Ravi. I have sinned! I have sinned! No, Rupa, don't say that. Everything will be fine. Everything will be fine. It will be fine! Everything will be fine! - How do you feel now? - I am fine now. Brother, will you take me away from here? Brother, I am really scared. Please take me away from here. I want to go back home. Brother, please! Yes, we are here to take you back. Grandpa, please forgive me. I know I made a mistake, but... I want to come back home. Please take me home. Yes? Can you tell me where can I find Ms. Rupa? - Ms. Rupa? - Yes. She is right there, bed number two. Thank you, sister. What's wrong? That woman... She won't let me go home. She will take me back! - Please ask her to leave! - OK. Don't you leave me! Please ask her to leave! Please! Let's get away from here! - No, brother! - Grandpa! Grandpa, what's going on? Come outside, I will tell you. Grandpa! Listen to me, grandpa! Brother! Come on, son! Where are you taking me? She is not Rupa anymore! She has sinned! That woman has told me everything. She was in that brothel for two long years! She eloped with a man and he sold her to a brothel! She doesn't exist for us now! She's infested with a disease! She has sinned! No, grandpa! She is my sister! My elder sister! She belongs to our family! We can't leave unless we take her with us! Just come with me! Our family has been a priest's family for the last three generations! Our entire village swears by our religious sanctity and our virtues! People worship God, but they respect our family! How can I take this sinner to that village? No! She chose a path to hell. Come, we will go home and perform last rites. To hell with your religion and your customs! I don't want any of this! You wanted to perform last rites for her! Why don't you do it for me, too? I am going back up there. - To my sister! - Brother! Brother, please save me! - Rupa! - Brother! Help! No! Rupa! Rupa! No! Ravi! - Ravi. - No! - Rupa! - Hey, Ravi. - Uncle Salim! - Ravi! Uncle, Rupa! I can't... Rupa! Mr. Salim, get this medication and sign this form. He must be admitted right away. But why? We must give him electric therapy! I will chop off my hand before signing this death warrant for my friend! It's pretty normal treatment for such a patient. Maybe it's normal for you, but my friend is special to me. So what are you going to do? Who am I to turn to about this? I'm turning to Him. The Almighty. He gave him this pain. He can take it away. There must be someone who will ease his pain. Hold on. Why are you crying? Don't create a scene. Do it properly. No clumsy jobs. Don't you cry, girl! I warn you! Crying is futile. Your fate is sealed now. Arrange the garland. If crying could change my destiny, wouldn't you see me crying all day? Are you done? Back off now! I cried a lot when people called me gay, a eunuch. But I was destined to become a eunuch. So I became one. And you are destined to become a slut, so get ready to be one. And you will make it to the top. Trust me. Oh, macho man, hold this properly. You will regret if you don't listen to me. Don't play with your fate. Just look at her. Her face looks haggard due to crying. Hey, don't you cry! Who will buy you if your face looks like that? Who is going to bid for you? Don't you cry. Get ready for next full moon night. You have no idea how beautiful you are. You are gonna set fire to this market. Ravi, why don't you speak up instead of sitting with a gloomy face? What's wrong with you? I don't get this at all. - Salim! Salim. - Yes? I have an idea. - What is it? - Let's get him married. If his wife will pester him, he'll have to talk. Here comes Gotya. - Come here. Listen to me. - What is it? Do you know anyone? We should get him married. Forget about it! If he is destined to get married, she'll appear out of nowhere. God has already decided everyone's fate. Ravi, come on, drop me at Chanda's place. Come on. No, Gotya, get some another cab. Come on, pal. You'll go crazy if you sit here like this. Come with me, let's do something! I have to pay cab fare in any case. Right? Why wouldn't I pay my friend? - Isn't that right? - Absolutely! - Perfect! - Am I right? Come on! Come on, pal! Come on! Ravi, I will be back soon. Get her! Don't let her escape! Get her! Save me! Take me from here! Save me! Come on, get out of there! Come on! Take her upstairs! - Come on! - Hey! Wait! Why are you forcing her if she doesn't want to go? Mind your own business! - I am going to whack you! - Keep out of this. Take your friend! - Get him out of here! - Yes! - Don't try to act smart! - Ravi, no. Just get lost! Come on. Back off, Ravi! Ravi, come on! Don't mess with them! Get back to your work! Get lost! You are the first person in this city I am not scared of! Take me away from here! Save me! For the first time in seven years, you spoke about a girl who is alive instead of talking about your dead sister. I think you're on the right track. Salim, that innocent face still haunts me. And she is calling me! She wants my help. How much do I have? You've stashed 30 grand over the last seven years. Give it to me. I will rescue her today. So you'll blow all your money on her? Ravi, let me tell you about love. Once you're engulfed by this fire, it just grows with each passing day. And it can never be put off! Gotya, I had a run-in with those guys. What if they recognize me? Don't talk rubbish. That place is filled with drunkards and peddlers! They wouldn't realize if their own father passed by them! So they won't recognize you. Don't worry! You know what? Just keep quiet. And let me do the talking. And the rest will be handled by Gullu. Gullu? Who is he? Are you nuts, Gotya? You want me to take away a girl from Maharani's den? You have no idea. This is no cakewalk! I know everything, Gullu. But you have to do this anyhow! But how will I do it? How? Listen, mister, this is where I earn my living. If she doesn't come back, I'll be out of business. Do you know the consequences? Why don't you think beyond that? You are a pimp! How are you going to answer to God? What will happen when your sins will be counted? Why don't you do at least one good deed? Watchdog! Will you keep it locked, because you are guarding it? Smoky! Don't you see that I've got new customers? Come on, jerk, let us in now! Bholu! Let them in! Idiot! Come, sir! Come on in, Gotya! Why do you need a pimp to visit us? Come in! - Look, I have brought my friend in here. - Really? He is shy as he is new here. - Sit down! - Sit down! He's back from abroad. Got a truckload of money. That's why I brought him here. This place means satisfaction guaranteed! My guarantee! That's fine. But where are the girls? Why not? Sure. Come on, get them out here. Sir, just turn around. I want that girl. What an amazing customer! He wants the girl who will be auctioned today. Why did you bring her out? She has already been sold. He has put in a bid of ten grand for her! Take her away! No! I bid twelve grand! Didn't I tell you she's been sold? Find some other girl! Just look there! She is good, isn't she? Two grand can't buy my honor. - Fifteen thousand! - Fifteen? Did you see that? Did you see? She is getting the right price now! That's why I say that without a pimp, you can't make much profit! Even I am willing to pay fifteen grand! Twenty grand! It's a matter of ego now. I'm not backing off! Thirty grand! OK, here is your thirty thousand. And I got two more! Thirty-two! Here's thirty-five thousand! Thirty-five! That's more like it! Now the girl will go to the highest bidder. Both of them have emptied their coffers! Pal, why don't you come tomorrow? What difference does a night make? Tomorrow she'll be much cheaper! No! No! I will come back with more money! But that girl will go with me. Listen, sir, this trade runs on time. First come, first served. That's it! Night and this trade stop for no one. Get lost if you haven't got more money. - Come on, sir. Hurry up. - Wait. - Here. - A single bill won't do. Take out a wad. Just a minute, sir. - Here it is. - Give it to him. Give it. Take this. And now this girl belongs to me. Hey, wait, why are you so excited? So have you got more than him? This is wrong, Maharani! You had cut a deal with me! This is inhuman! You have cheated me. Get lost. Do you think pimps and sluts are humans? Trying to teach me about humanity? Take this! Just go and continue with your corrupt business! Don't lecture us about honesty! Get lost! Excuse me, sir. Have a blast tonight. Go easy on her. She is a new girl. Girls, get back to your work! Get back! - Go back there. - Where are you going? - Stop! Just wait there! - Leave her! - Leave her! - Chanda, leave! Go on, my boy. Are you blushing? Move it, pal! Go on! Look, she is eagerly waiting for you! Take them to a room. Come on, pal. What's wrong? Can I take her out? Why not? Sure! You have paid for her. You can take her anywhere. But where will you go? Which hotel? Citizen hotel! We've already booked the room. - At Karim's place? - Yes! I know him pretty well. Come on, go! Listen, girl, he is going to be your man for tonight! Make him happy. Don't create a scene. Is that clear? Come on, take her! Oh, please move. Come on, don't be shy like a kid. Go! And give her some fancy name. Gotya, where are you going, pal? Why don't you wait here for tonight with Chanda? No, boss. I would rather leave. I've never spent a night with Chanda at your place. But today, you got to stay here. Till your friend returns with that girl, you'll stay with us. Gotya, don't feel bad. It's strictly business! She is new and so is this fellow. Who knows if they'll ever return? So you'll be here as our security deposit. Till tomorrow. You can leave! But be here by morning, OK? Or else we have your friend with us! Bye! Come on, Gotya. Chanda! Chanda! Take Gotya inside. I didn't guess you came to save me. Are they still alive? How could I let them die? Keep them with you for tonight. There is going to be night every day, Ravi! I will make sure I will be always there. For how long? Till the day you'll be free! Now tell me, where will you go? To the temple. I feel I should ask something from God. I have sworn. To make you mine. I have sworn. To make you mine. Your eyes gleam. With only love. I have sworn to make you mine. I will let everyone know. What love really is. I will let everyone know. What love really is I will vanquish. Everyone for you. Your love. Has made me crazy. Your love. Has made me crazy. I have sworn to make you mine. I want to steal. The dew from your lips. I want to steal. The dew from your lips I want to. Spend my life with you. Your intoxicating love. Runs through my blood. Your intoxicating love. Runs through my blood. I have sworn. To make you mine. Your arms. Hold the world for me. Your arms. Hold the world for me I am nothing without you. I have a world of happiness. As I have found you. I have a world of happiness. As I have found you. I have sworn. To make you mine. Your eyes gleam. With only love. I have sworn. To make you mine. Pooja, I would have never left you there, but for Gotya. Ravi, you gave me so much respect in a night I don't care if I die now. Pooja, I won't let anything happen to you. I need you. Tonight I'll rescue you from there. I don't care about the consequences. Ravi, this is total madness! Salim, come on, make him understand. Today he mortgaged his cab and got the money. He'll pay it back and save her tonight! Maybe day after tomorrow! Or after that! How long will you continue to save her? I just want to save her. That's it! I don't care if I'll have to sell myself. - Got that? - Did you hear that? Did you hear what he said? - Let me go! - Come on! - Let me go! - Come on! Didn't I tell you that I don't want to go with you? Don't force me! What if I am a prostitute? I still have feelings. - I don't want to be with him! - Come on! - Let me go! - Don't act too smart! - Let me go! - Come on! Let me go! What is it? To whom are you signaling? Don't push him! He is our customer! And customers should not be pushed, pal! Get away, you pimp! What are you doing here? Go and find more customers! How can you call me a pimp? You called me a pimp? Shall I tell you what you are? Shall I? What's up? What's going on? What are you calling him? Come over here! Come on! Come on! Now tell me. Tell me, what is it? Tell me, what is it? Rascal! I might not be fully a man... But I can take down five men like you! Tell me, why are you here? Tell me! I brought that guy again! And he is back with a lot of money! So are you back again? What will you do with this girl? Just play around? Just tell me the price! I will do what I want. None of your business. That's definitely my business! I just don't sit around! I've been here for thirty years! This morning, when you brought her back I looked at her and I realized that you didn't sleep with her last night. Look, I am paying you more than last night! I see. If you want, my friend will stay over! But tonight, she will go with me. Got that? I am running this brothel for everyone! We got so many customers and it's my job to please everyone. But a jerk like you comes over once in a blue moon, who pays thirty grand but doesn't sleep with a girl. Either you are crazy or you love her! And both the facts are dangerous for us! Go find some other brothel. Get lost! Or you can take another girl. I will let you go with Chanda for free! She is very close to your friend, isn't she? - Just take her out! - No! I only want her! Oh, I am sick of you! What kind of man are you? Hey, throw him out! - Hurry up! - Come on! - Hurry up! - Get lost! What are you looking at? Hey! What are you up to? - Don't beat him! Don't beat him! - Get lost! - Hey, don't touch him! - Get lost, you pimp! Are you crazy? Whenever you tried to stop lovers. Love has deepened. It has deepened even more. Whenever the world.

Yes, I agree! Yes? Come. Come in! Let's go! Maharani, just as this is her first time, it's mine, as well. So what's the matter? Hold her! What's the big deal? I want to ask you something about deflowering. - What is it? - Come here. Why should I come there? You hold her. I will watch from here. Come here for a minute. OK, here I come. So tell me. Well, I... "Well, I..." What is it? I want to... - Are you feeling shy? - Yes. You can whisper it in my ears. Tell me. Come on, Pooja! Back off! Back off! Open the door. Or I will slit his throat! Open the door! Open it! Pooja, run! Gotya, run! Gotya! Run! Chanda, come on! Gullu, run! Come on, Gotya! Come on! Get in the car, Ravi! Hurry up! - Is she all right? - She has bled a lot! Take her to the hospital. No! Let me bleed! Let me writhe in pain! Maharani! This blood flow, and this intense pain will constantly remind me that that scoundrel... has taken away a girl from Maharani's den! Maharani! Now this wound will continue to bleed till I find that girl. I swear on my turf, if I don't bury that fellow here, I'll change my name from Maharani. Gotya! Gotya! Where is he? Gotya! Gotya! I saw you and my heart danced. The desire to live has awoken. The desire to live till doomsday Has awoken in my heart. I saw you and my heart danced. The desire to live has awoken. The desire to live till doomsday Has awoken in my heart. Never seen such a beautiful ambiance. And this magic is incomparable. Nobody has loved me this way before. And I didn't love anyone this way either. This happiness is here to stay. We are devoid of all sorrow. I feel like flying away. And touching the sky. The desire to live has awoken. The desire to live till doomsday Has awoken in my heart. I saw you and my heart danced. My life has changed. And I feel like living again. Everything feels so changed. Even I am changing too. My dream has been fulfilled I've met my loved one. Between the sanctum of clouds. We are ready to live. The desire to live has awoken. The desire to live till doomsday Has awoken in my heart. I saw you and my heart danced. The desire to live has awoken. The desire to live till doomsday Has awoken in my heart. May God bless them! At least I have done one good deed in my life. The strap has come loose. Never mind. What's going to happen to me? I can't go back to Maharani. She might kill me! I really messed up with her! Get him! Save me! - Somebody save me! - Get him! Beloved doesn't agree with me. Beloved doesn't agree with me. Beloved doesn't agree with me. Beloved doesn't agree with me. Beloved doesn't agree with me. Uncle Kareem, save me! Suleiman! Uncle Kareem! Somebody save me! They will kill me! No! Maharani, please forgive me. I was wrong. I won't do it again! I know God punishes everyone right here. Where will a pimp like me go? I am going to die here! But how will you kill me? Come on! So kill me now! Hurry up! - Kill me! Don't make me wait! - Gullu! Gullu, it's not your fault. The fault must be in your legs. You ran away from me, right? - Break his legs! - No! Play! Beloved doesn't agree with me. Uncle Kareem! Please save me! Don't break my legs! Beloved doesn't agree with me. Beloved doesn't agree with me. Louder! Beloved doesn't agree with me. Beloved doesn't agree with me. Brother, have some more. No, not for me. Give it to Gotya. After all he is married, not me. No, he is just joking! Do you intend to kill me by overeating? We are just married. At least let me enjoy it for a few days! What do you say, Salim? Am I right? Please have it. - Sister-in-law! - Enough. - Sister-in-law! - Tell me. Please take these girls to your mother-in-law. - I want to have a word with Salim. - OK. Please come with me. Please! Come on, kids. What are you thinking about? At least let me think since you are not. How long will you keep running away from them? How long? Today, they came to my hotel looking for you. Pakya told me this. Tomorrow, they might come here. How long will you hide from them? - Answer me! - Salim is absolutely right! I didn't tell you, but they had gone to my den. They ransacked it! Now I am out of business! What should I do? Tell me, what should I do? Shall I take her there again? Why don't you all understand? I love her! Didn't I tell you not to take her there again? Didn't I tell you not to love her? All I am saying is that we must go to police. Let's get their help. Do you know someone who can help us? Yes, I do. I hope you didn't tell anyone about this. No, sir, we didn't. We didn't want to tell anyone about this. That's why we decided to meet you personally. Sir, please tell us what we should do. We know it's difficult for us to get rid of them! And it also concerns the lives of two innocent girls. Where are those girls now? They are staying at our friend's house. But we can't keep them there much longer. Those girls must give me a written statement. Only then can a case be filed. I can't arrest them unless and until a case is filed. These prostitution racketeers are pretty powerful. We must be absolutely careful. I have a suggestion. Bring those girls to Satyam Car Park at 4 p.m. I will record their statement, then a case will be filed. Then you'll get police protection. Maharani! Gotya, run! You can run but you can't hide. You are a mouse and I am a cat Run here I come. The cat cried meow. The cat cried meow. Why are you scared of me? I am here just to hug. And give you some love. Pooja, calm down. Pooja. Gotya, run! Run! No. Chanda! Gotya! Gotya! No, Gotya! Ravi, go away! Save Pooja. - Gotya. - Save Pooja, Ravi! Gotya! So, Gotya? Does it hurt? It hurts? Let me show you. Kill me, Maharani! Bye! Hello, Lalwadi Police Station? Inspector, you have betrayed your profession! You are unworthy of the medal given to you! But you have to remember one thing, Inspector! I will come back! I will hide her somewhere and I will be back for revenge! Soon your photo will be in the papers for the last time. As an obituary. He has run away with my jeep! I am answerable to someone, Maharani! What do I tell them now? I wonder where he is! How will I find him now? Calm down, Inspector! Get a cold drink for him. Wait! I don't want a cold drink. Get to the point! Get to the point? I'll get to the point. Sure, here it comes! Are you crazy? But now the case can be filed, can't it? Now go tell your seniors you were attacked on your way home and you were off duty. That he slashed you with a razor, robbed you and took away your jeep. Now the entire police force will hunt him! Go boy! Send all-out search signals! Every check post should have the jeep's license number! Listen carefully! He has stolen a police jeep. Ravi! No, I am fine. Who is this? This is Ravi. Where are you, Ravi? I don't know, Salim. I don't know anything. I don't know where I'll go from here. I just know Pooja is not safe in Mumbai. Salim, we have been betrayed. Somebody betrayed us. That police inspector works for Maharani. What? I will call you again. Salim, please be careful. - Regards. - Regards. - Are you all right? - Yes. Pooja, is there any place where I can leave you and go back? You will go back there? Gotya was my friend, Pooja. The King of Rampur's palace is a mile away from here. My uncle is a caretaker over there. We can go there. OK. Rest for a while. You look really tired. No. I must get back. I can't stop here. When will you be back? Maybe never. Who was he, Pooja? Blood! Let's take him to the doctor. No! No! It's a bullet wound. A doctor might inform the police. And then they will know where we are, Pooja. No, I can't go to the doctor. I won't go. I won't go to a doctor! Come on, dear! Sir, come in. Now tell me who he is and what's wrong with him. It's a bullet wound. Bullet wound? Why didn't you tell me this before? What am I supposed to do about this? Why don't you have a look first? The wound has become infected and he has lost a lot of blood. He is burning with fever! Shiva, I am not a doctor! - I can't do this! - Listen to me. If you want to save him, you must take him to a hospital! No! We can't do that! If we don't do that, he will surely die! Right here! I know that! I know that very well! But if we take him to the hospital, police will come to know about us. And what if that happens? Then what will happen? They'll sell me back to the same brothel he has rescued me from. Sir, I beg of you! Please do something! OK! Mix some butter and turmeric and apply it to his wound. Mix turmeric in the milk, give it to him as he gains consciousness. That's it! And leave the rest to God! No, Gotya! Leave me! Gotya! - No! No! I will kill them! - Ravi! - Gotya! - Calm down! - Calm down! - Gotya! - Gotya! - Everything will be fine! - No! - Calm down, Ravi! Everything will be fine! - No! No! - Control yourself! - Gotya! - Ravi. Ravi. Ravi! Ravi! Ravi! - Yes? - Inspector Irani. I have to ask you a few questions. Tell me. Your friend is in danger. If you know anything about him, then tell me. I am a police officer and I want to help. I have no idea, sir. I will let you know if I find out anything. I look at your face and I can see you know lots of things. He called you, didn't he? Didn't he? It seems you've never been to a police station, right? Trust me, sir. I don't know anything about him. - Why would I lie to you, sir? - You are right. - You are not lying, right? - No. He doesn't know anything. But still, keep an eye on him. Because he's bound to meet him someday. - So how is he now? - Everything is fine. He's sleeping, let him rest. He's waking up. You've recovered because of him. He has saved your life. Well, it's not me but rather her! She's given you a new life! Thank you. I want to call my friend in Mumbai. How can I call him? Don't get up, son! Don't get up! For that, you must go to the post office. Why don't you rest for a few days? And take this medicine. And then you will be all right. Dear, medicine. Give him some of it. Look sir, this is a hill station. And lots of tourists visit this place. And it's really difficult to find them in such a situation! But why don't you try a little harder? We are sure that they must be somewhere there! The girl comes from a hill station and she is local. We'll do our best! They will find them. - Where's the phone? - It's inside. Get me tea! And some biscuits too! Uday. Isn't she Shiva's niece? No, pal, you are mistaken. But who is that guy with her? Who knows? He doesn't belong here. Who is this? This is Ravi! Ravi? Where are you? And how are you? Everything is fine, Salim! Don't come over here, they are looking for you. OK. Salim, I need some money. I hope you can send some. Sure, just give me your address. - The address is, Rampur Palace. - Yes! - Rampur. - OK. I will send you a money order today. - Don't worry! - OK. - God bless you! - Regards. Dear, I am going to the market. I will be late. - Take care. - Yes, uncle. I wouldn't have lived without you I would have died If you hadn't come. I wouldn't have lived without you I would have died If you hadn't come. I would have never known. What love really is I wouldn't have lived without you. I wouldn't have lived without you I would've died If you hadn't come. I would have never known. What love really is I wouldn't have lived without you I would've died If you hadn't come. The fragrance lingers everywhere. Flowers bloom That's how the spring arrives. The time to fall in love. Comes only once. I feel like. Showering love on you I feel like. Accepting your love I feel like. Accepting your love I would have never loved anyone Except for you. I would have never loved anyone Except for you. How could I express my love? I would have never known. What love really is. I wouldn't have lived without you I would've died If you hadn't come. I can't forget you. Even if I want to I have waited for you. For many days and nights. If I have to. Go away from you. You will miss me. Every moment. You will miss me. Every moment I get scared when you say this. I get scared when you say this. You torment me so much. I would have never known. What love really is I wouldn't have lived without you I would've died If you hadn't come. When I look into the mirror I see your face my beloved. Whenever I breathe. Your fragrance lingers in my mind. It's now difficult. To live without you I am your heart. You are mine I am your heart. You are mine I would have repented all my life. I would have repented all my life. If I'd hidden this from you. I would have never known. What love really is I wouldn't have lived without you. I wouldn't have lived without you I would've died If you hadn't come I would have never known. What love really is I wouldn't have lived without you I would've died If you hadn't come. Pooja. Pooja! Uncle, I apologize to you for causing you problems. This is not a city, Ravi. Here people can create mountains out of a molehill. I am aware of that, uncle. That's why I want to marry Pooja as soon as possible. If you agree, I'll call Salim and ask him to send some money. So that I can handle all the wedding expenses. Water. Water. Water! Water! What is water, Salim? We will give you liquor. And scotch! Right? But you should tell us where your friend is! We have been sitting here for two hours. Look, if you don't tell us where he is, this macho-man will slice your belly and take out that address that you gulped down! You are a scoundrel! Do you think I fear death?

He spat on me? Dear God, how could this happen? Hello. May I speak to Salim? This is Pakya. What are you doing there? They killed him! Ravi, they killed Salim! Salim is no more now! So, old man, I hear your niece has brought a lover from Mumbai? Don't you feel ashamed for saying this? Shame? You and your favorite niece should feel ashamed. She wanders everywhere with her lover! If she wanted a lover, aren't we three enough for her? We would have come at her first call! Are you blind? You scoundrel! Just see where you are walking! What's going on here? That man over there! Just look how he bashed all of us! - What? - We found the boy! - Come again. - Yes! - Does he match our description? - Yes, sir! Very good, Inspector! Very good! Pooja? Pooja! Pooja?
