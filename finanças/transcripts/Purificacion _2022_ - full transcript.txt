--== McEphie ==-- Our Father, Who art in heaven, Hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy Will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Our Father, Who art in heaven, Hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy Will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven. You cannot save them! There is nothing you can do! You're reminded of your sister again. There's been so many victims. Don't be afraid. Only sinful women are being killed. God is punishing them. I know this woman. Yes. She's one of the prostitutes. Prostitute? If I'm not mistaken, she works at the brothel. I'm wondering about the wounds on their hands and feet. I think it's called 'stigmata'. But I thought they only appeared on holy people. Holy? What's holy about gyrating in the dark? Do you know the victim personally? You've got so much to say! Would you like me to invite you to the precinct? Nevermind, ma'am. Could you move aside, please. What about you? What are you looking at? Father, how are you? I'm okay. I'm sorry, Father. I thought you were... It's okay. I'm the new priest at the parish. I just moved here. Probably why you haven't seen me. My name is Father Ricardo Baltazar. Father, forgive my partner. This is our fourth victim so far. I'm going to tell you something, but keep it between us. One of the victims was her sister, Teresita. That's why this case is personal to her. Are you all right? Yes, Father. I'm just in a sour mood. The investigation's not going anywhere. Don't worry, soon you will find your answers. You just have to pray. As it says in First Peter chapter 5, verse 7: "Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you." The killings will not stop until all the sinful women in this town repent for their sins. What do you mean, ma'am? Don't you know what stigmata symbolizes? That's proof that the Holy Cross of Jesus Christ has come to cleanse all evil. You cannot arrest the Messenger of God. My dear friends, you are getting in the way of our work. It is getting late. Sorry but I have to ask you to leave. We still have a lot of work to do. Please let us get to it. - Go back to your homes. - You'd better go And make dinner. You can do nothing against the wrath of God! Go back to your homes. What now, Gabriela? The bosses are breathing down our necks. Congressman doesn't appreciate these cases before the elections. It will ruin his campaign. If I were you, I'd start pulling my weight. Prove that you deserve your position. I'm sure you're familiar with their temper. Yes, sir. Help me! In the last few days, our town is being ravaged by an unknown assailant. Perhaps God is letting this happen in order to open our eyes to the brevity of life. While we still can, let us go back to the grace of God and ask for forgiveness. According to the Holy Bible, "it is only through the shed blood of Jesus Christ that sin's stain can be removed." Ma'am Pentang, we'd like to ask you a few more questions. We have additional questions that might help with the case. I already told you everything. Ma'am Pentang. Why are you avoiding us? Don't you want us to help your daughter to achieve justice? Will justice bring my daughter back? Her name's been tainted in Sta. Monica. I hear people whisper that she deserved what happened to her. Because she was a prostitute. They say it was God's will that she died that way. I understand what you're going through. I only want justice for all the victims. Justice? Does justice exist in this town? We all know that your husband and his father, the Congressman, are the only law in this God-forsaken town. What's your rank again? Inspector, isn't it? How were you promoted? Before all the killings started, other crimes have been committed. The land of farmers have been taken from them, people have died fighting for what's right. Were they given justice? Answer me. Good afternoon. I know that you are grieving. But you have no right to talk that way to our law enforcers. They only want to help. We all have our duties. How can they do their job if we refuse to cooperate? I understand that you are hurting and confused. But as it says in Proverbs chapter 3, verse 5, "Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding." Have faith. All right, Father. I will cooperate with them because you asked me. Thanks so much for your help earlier. It's nothing. It is my pleasure as a priest to be of service. Father, we'd like to ask you a favor. You may have noticed that ma'am Pentang acts cold towards us. We're sure that most people in town feel the same way. Can you help us? Of course. No problem. And Father, almost everyone in town goes to church. If you hear or notice anything strange or suspicious, if you would kindly inform us. As I said earlier, it would be my honor. Are you all right? Do you believe in ghosts? Why do you ask? No reason. It's nothing. I hope you catch the one responsible for these murders. So that the souls of the dead can rest. Gabriela. Gabriela. I've been calling your name! Are you stupid? You're still so delicious. Even if you're always pissing me off. Stop fussing. Donâ€™t forget, if not for my family, you wouldn't be in your position. Good day, Father. I just wanted to ask if you noticed... or heard anything unusual among the churchgoers these past few days. Paeng gathered that the victims were regular churchgoers. Where did you get this bruise? Father, we chased after a pickpocket in the market. I ran after him so that's what happened. New spreads quickly in this small town. Besides, you are in the house of God. You may speak your honest thoughts. According to Galician chapter 5, verse 14, "For all the law that is fulfilled in one word, even in this, thou shalt love your neighbor as thyself." How can you love and serve your people well as a police officer if you can't love yourself? I'm sorry, Father, but I didn't come here to talk about my personal life. I just want to do my job. To give justice to the victims. I haven't noticed anything these past few days. Except for a particular incident. Though I don't know if I should tell you because I might be reading too much into it. Tell me, Father. It might help with the case. There was an incident after the holy mass. How dare you enter the temple of the Lord in those clothes? Why do you care? Why are you wearing all-black? Are you in mourning? Your veil stinks! How about washing it? Go ahead and have your fun because the holy angel of God is coming for you next. I'm leaving, Father. This is our very first lead. Thank you. You're welcome. Gabriela, when you need anything, don't hesitate to come to me. Don't think of me as a priest. Think of me as your friend. I'll go ahead, Father. Thank you That's all the information we have, sir. We need to act now. Good job, Gabriela. But starting tomorrow, I want evidence. You and Paeng, I want you to do a background check on that Mira. All information will help our case. Yes, sir! Good day, ma'am Mira! Ah, mister. Do you know where ma'am Mira lives? Ma'am Mira? Yes, ma'am. She lives just through there. Do you know that ma'am Mira, that poor old lady, she lives alone. She doesn't have anyone else. The poor thing. Her only son killed himself. He caught his wife with a lover. But the wife's body was later found in the forest. Up on a tree, hanging with holes in her hands and feet. Ma'am Mira's down on her luck. There's nothing unusual about the subject's movement. When she leaves home, she goes to church. From church, she walks to the cemetery. She's visiting a grave there. I gathered a lot of intel on the subject directly from her neighbor. Ma'am Mira used to be more cheerful. But after the death of her son, there was a drastic change in her. What happened to her son? Suicide. When he found out his wife whored around with a man, he couldn't accept it. Can you identify who her son's wife is? It's Kriselda. Kriselda? You mean the last victim? Yes, sir. I confirmed. If so, she has a motive to kill Kriselda. She also made threats against those other women in public that they'll be next. I want you to keep tailing Mira. Is that clear? We have no solid evidence against her yet. But for now, she is our prime suspect. Yes, sir. - Okay? - Yes, sir. Partner, we've been here for a while. Nothing is happening. She's just staring into space. - Hey! - I'm tired. Partner! Get up. We might lose her! - No, we won't. - Let's just take turns. She won't go anywhere. We've been watching her. She's not doing anything. The day's almost over. I told you. She's gone! Hurry up! Jesus. We lost her. I told you this would happen. All right, here's the plan. Check her house, check the church. If you see her, call me. I'll look for her around here, okay? - You got it. - Let's go. Drop your weapon! If you don't do as I say, I'll shoot you. What's wrong with what I'm doing? Women like her is the reason why my son is gone! You're just making things worse for yourself. Worse? What's wrong with helping God's messenger to get rid of the unclean? Go ahead! Shoot me! After all, I'm sure I'll end up in heaven. With my son. Because I helped. Congratulations, Inspector Gabriela Isidro. Our station is proud of you. Think of all the men we have in there, and you're the one who got our killer. Sir, don't you feel anything weird? Something doesn't add up. What doesn't add up? You caught the killer, you shot her. What more do you need? Sir, the manner of killing doesn't fit the profile. She didn't even have a sharp object with her to inflict the stigmata on the victim. She didn't have a rope to tie the victim with either. Well, you did catch her. Her stuff might just be around the corner. But you caught her before she could execute her plan. What did you think? There's a murderous angel on the loose? Hey. What's up, partner? Do you enjoy getting an earful from sir? First time he gives you praises and you go and ruin it. Something's really off about this, partner. Something doesn't feel right. We're missing something. Something's not right. I don't think it's you. What are you doing here? Are you ready for me? I've missed you. Everyone! Someone's been killed! Everyone! There's a dead body! Everyone! There's a dead body! It's Father. Good morning, Father. - Father. - Father. Father. You told me it's over. You even called me, Paeng. You said you handled it. How could this happen again? That's what we thought, Father. Gabriela! When will this end? The people are scared! We will do everything, Fatherâ€¦ to make sure there won't be any more victims. While we were talking, I saw a man. Let's go after him! Let's go! Hang on, Father. Fatherâ€¦ Fatherâ€¦ Fatherâ€¦ Partner! Father's beside the body. Father? Father. Are you okay? Stand up, Father. Do you recognize the victim? I'm sorry. I see so many churchgoers, I can't possibly remember all of their faces. I'm sorry you had to accompany me to church. That's all right, Father. This is nothing compared to all your help. Bryan. Where are you going? Wait! Come with me to the precinct. Hold it right there. What's going on? Father, this is the man who ran from the crime scene. No, he's an honest steward of the church. You monster! You son of a bitch! - I'll kill you! - Julio! I will kill you! Calm down, Julio. Why are you arresting me? Why do you want to kill Bryan? Do you know anything about the killings here in Sta. Monica? If you don't start talking, you won't like what we'll do to you. Did you know you almost killed a good man earlier? You wanted to commit a sin on church property. You don't know, Father, that you invited and nurtured a demon inside your church. What do you mean? I am Julio and your new victim is my wife Jasmine. I've known for some time that she had a relationship with Bryan. Did you kill your wife because you were consumed by your rage? And you want to kill her lover next? I cannot kill the mother of my children. Yesterday we had an argument because the whole town knows she's sleeping with Bryan. I threatened that I would leave her and take our children with me. She left and promised to end her relationship with Bryan. I let her because she begged me. But she never came back. Then I find out that she's dead. Bryan killed her! Sir, confirmed. He is Julio Zamora. I talked to his drinking buddies. They've been drinking from noon till late yesterday. He's not the killer. I swear I didn't kill my wife. It's Bryan. He killed her. He is the killer. All right, uncuff and release him. Yes, sir. We will conduct a manhunt for Bryan. Father, I suggest you stay the night with Paeng. So you'll be safe. It's dangerous for you to be alone in church. Bryan might come for you. I believe that God is with me. He won't let me come to harm. So I'll be fine staying alone in church. As it says in Joshua chapter 1, verse 9, "Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous... Don't be frightened, don't be dismayed... For the Lord your God is with you wherever you go." There is nothing you can doâ€¦ More will die. We will make them payâ€¦ You are not their saviorâ€¦ We will kill them one by oneâ€¦ You are uselessâ€¦ Father. Father, are you okay? I'm fine. I was just shocked that he was already inside my room and waiting for me. He confessed everything to me. He had nothing to do with it. That's right. I didn't do anything. Jasmine and I were supposed to meet in the afternoon but she didn't show up. I could never think of hurting her. So I was shocked to see her dead. I got scared. Because the killer might come for me. That's why I ran. I just wanted Father to know that my conscience is clear. So I waited for him before leaving for good. He persuaded me to turn myself in and tell you the truth. Handcuffs! Whatever you say, I don't care. I don't regret what I did. Bryan is innocent. He was afraid of what might happen to him. So he wanted to run away. He's just saying that. He really meant to escape. I can prove that Bryan's telling the truth. I could see him by the church gate, from afternoon to night as if waiting for someone. Bryan is innocent. Keep an eye on him. He is our primary suspect in the killings. I don't think that's fair. Yes, he sinned, but there's no evidence pointing the blame on him for the killings. Father, stay out of this. The important thing is, we have a suspect to present when the Congressman calls. You know how it is. Those people don't give shit who they step on Right, Gabriela? Where'd you go? You came home earlier. You went out again? Something came up and I had to go back to the precinct. I'm going up. I'm tired. How's the case you're investigating? I heard sinful women are being targeted. Those whores deserve what's coming to them. They have no right to live. And we should be grateful. At least the world's being rid of sinners. Not so fast. Looks like you're doing a lot of good for the precinct. Even if you're useless in our relationship. No, wait. You were good for something. When your family was in debt. Your family sold you to me because your crackhead sister, Teresita pawned off your property to pay for her addiction. Right? What? It's true, isn't it? Your sister's a crackhead. If I hadn't gotten you pregnant and married you, you'd be dead in a ditch. You owe my family a debt of gratitude. What? You got something to say? You should quit the force. You couldn't even save our son's life! How do you expect to save someone else? Hey. Cook something for me. All right, I'll ask the help to make you something. Miss? Are you an idiot? I asked you, didn't I? I'm sorry, I don't like the smell of raw food. It makes me nauseous. You'll disobey me? You're acting up, huh? You're useless. Help! Help! Help! Our son's death was your fault. If there's someone useless in this relationship, it's you. You don't do anything but drink and fuck around. You're talking back at me, huh. If you hadn't pissed me off that day, we wouldn't have lost our son. Good morning, Father. Good morning to you, too. Please have a seat. Father, I was wondering if Bryan told you anything else. We might find a clue. There's nothing else. I told you everything I know. Then I should get going. Gabriela. Your husband shouldn't treat you like that. That's wrong. Just tell me and I'll find a way to help you. Gabriela? Are you okay? Your face went slightly red. Are you sick? You better drink some medicine. - I have some here. - No, thanks, Father. I'm leaving. The day of judgment has come! Repent of your sins. God's messenger has singled out sinful women for punishment. Will you wait for God to cleanse your soul upon the Holy Cross? Change before it's too late! Hey! What are you standing around for? What are you looking at, huh? You must be a criminal. I know your type! You! You're a woman! You are one of the most sinful women here in Sta. Monica! Because of you, many have lost their land and livelihood. You're next in line to be tried on the cross! And even if you repent, there is nothing you can do! That's enough. Don't you know that harassment is against the law? Stay out of this! This is all beyond the law of man. This is the Lord's will. You couldn't do anything to help your sister when God imposed her sentence! Go ahead. I challenge you. Shoot me. Even if die, I will go straight to heaven because I am without sin. So please, shoot! Gabriela. What are you waiting for? After all that I contributed to Sta. Monica, how dare anyone call me a sinner? Calm down. You have no enemies here. You don't understand, Father. I'm the sinner? I drove here to drop off my donation to the church. Then I get greeted by that kind of filth? Ma'am. Ma'am, are you okay? Have you got anything between your ears? Huh? What do you think? I've been calling you. What took you so long? Am I not donating enough to your precinct to deserve your full attention? Ma'am, I'm really sorry. We've just got our hand full right now. That's why we couldn't be here faster. Arrest that man! He called me a sinner. If you don't deal with this pronto, forget about your bonus! Ma'am, I don't think you should be talking to sir that way. Now I'm the bad guy. I know you're the one who defended me earlier but don't think we're on the same level. Don't worry. I'll up my donations to your father-in-law's election funds. I made no implications, ma'am. You shouldn't talk to someone as if you've brought their soul. After feeding practically everyone here in Sta. Monica, this is how I get treated? Huh? The only reason people are even suffering here is because you grabbed their lands. Fine, let's say you're loaning to them but you're setting grossly unfair interest. And if they can't pay you back, you take their lands. - Ma'am. - Partner. What? Let me go! Jade. What the hell? Father, let go of me. Jade, that's enough. What on earth has gotten into you? She was disrespecting you! I had to endure her curses and insults because of you! Report to me first thing tomorrow. I'll teach you a lesson. Boss has been chewing me off since yesterday. I come in first thing and he's got me all chewed out. Just ignore him. Why'd you have to mess with Jade anyway? You already know she's rich and influential. She inherited a lot of money from her dead husband, right? I was looking out for him! What's he getting angry at me for? I'm not some ornament back there. I had to speak up. Good morning, officers. Can I ask a question? What is it, ma'am? My name is Auring. Where is the church of Sta. Monica? I'd like to visit Father Ricardo Baltazar. He used to be our priest in Sta. Elena before he got transferred here. I thought I'd bring him vegetables and his favorite dish. You came a long way. Did you come all the way here to see him? No, I have a son who lives near here. I said, I might as well drop by to see Father and give him his favorite dish, Braised Fish. Father used to request that I cook this dish all the time. I'll take you to him. Oh, no! That's no necessary. I'm sure you're busy. I wouldn't want to take up your time. Ma'am, we're not busy. It's okay. He's busy, but Iâ€™m not. Partner. Let me take madam because if we both go, the boss will look for us. If anyone asks for me, tell them I'm on patrol. Okay? Thank you. You're welcome, ma'am. Good day. Is Father around? Good day. He's not here right now. He left this morning. Huh? Father is not there. What a shame. Could I ask a favor? If you could just bring this to his office. It's Braised Fish. These veggies, too. Okay, I'll bring these in. Thank you. Oh, dear, what now? Too bad Father and I couldn't meet. But I'm sure he'll be glad to see the vegetables I brought him. You know how much more veggies we need when we're older. Old? Father doesn't look that old. You're right, dear. He really doesn't look it. Because he's always smiling and happy! If it wasn't for his cane, you wouldn't notice how old he really is. Cane? I don't think he's got a cane. Hang on a second. Hello? Son. All right, I'll be right there. Yes. Yes. I'm sorry, I should be going. My husband is having an asthma attack. What are you doing here? Father Ricardo came by Papa's office last time. He's looking for someone to help him with a working student who needs a scholarship. Papa told me to take care of it. That's why I'm here. You know how much we love to help the needy. I haven't seen that watch before. This? It's a present from Papa. I've had it for a long time. - Come here. - Come on, dear. How are you? You know each other? This is Emily, a working student. She's still looking for a scholarship. I hope you'll help her, Congressman. Ah, Gabriela. Emily sings very well, too. She joined a singing competition and won. Right in the next town. So I invited her to join our choir. That's my baby. Who else would she take after but me? Oh, mom. Let's go inside so I can introduce Emily to the choir members. Okay, Father. Father, may I talk to you for a moment? Please go ahead. Wait for me inside the church. Okay. Come on, dear. Just now, an Auring came asking for you. Auring? I don't know anyone by that name. Really? She told me you guys were close. You used to ask her cook for you. She brought you some vegetables. Auring. Yes, Auring! I almost forgot about her. What's going on? Father, what's your favorite dish? Beef Shank Soup. If that's served on the table, I'll eat a lot. I see. I forgot to mention, Father, she also brought your favorite dish, Braised Fish? Beef Shank Soup is my favorite dish, but my favorite cooking by Auring, is her Braised Fish. Father, may I ask why you're no longer using your cane? She told you that story, too, did she? Since I stopped eating unhealthy food my knee felt better and I didn't have to use a cane anymore. If that's all, I should go in. Emily's waiting for me. I've been sending you messages. Why are you late? I'm sorry. I had to walk mom home first. I feel like you might be hiding from me. If I hadn't said I wouldn't prepare your scholarship forms, you would keep ignoring me. Because I don't want to do this anymore. You can't refuse. What I want, I get. I'll sort out the docs for your scholarship as soon as I get to Papa's office. Next time, if I message you, I want you to answer me right away. Okay? Hey. Hey. I actually missed you. Wait for my message later. I might text you again. Okay? I'll pick you up. Yeah? Are you going out? Yes. My college friend came home from Europe. So I'm going to see him. I might not get home till tomorrow. Don't wait for me. Help me! Help! Help! Our Lord, forgive us for our sins. Who are you? The church is still closed. You can come back later. Father. You startled me. Father, what's Emily's guitar doing there? I don't know. I just heard someone playing a guitar so I came in here. I will tell you this, Father... Emily is dead. I'm going to be honest with you. That guitar is a strong evidence to make you a suspect. I forbid you to leave town until the investigation is over. I have nothing to do with the killings that are happening in this town. But I see their spirits. I don't know what they're trying to tell me, butâ€¦ But I can see them. Our condolences for the death of your daughter. Can you tell us who was the last person Emily was with last night? There's something important weâ€™d like to ask you. Do you know if Emily committed a grave sin? In these murders, only sinful women have been targeted. Could you tell us what Emily did? You don't know anything! Yes, my daughter was no saint. She had an abortion. But that's because of that monster, your father-in-law! What are you saying, ma'am? My daughter was forced to be your son's mistress because we needed money for my treatment. She got pregnant. But when the Congressman found out, he forced her to get rid of the child because it would ruin his precious reputation! Just cry it out, partner. Your husband did a terrible thing. I'm fine. I'll be all right. What's your plan? I don't know. I'm confused. - Ma'am. - You can do it. Ma'am, we found a new piece of evidence at Emily's crime scene. Thought you might want to see it. Partner, what happened to you? Your head's off somewhere else. Nothing, partner. I'm just thinking. Yesterday, I noticed how intently you were looking at the watch. Why? Listen, everyone. On Sunday, hold off all your assignments. We'll be on high alert in the town plaza for Congressman Paterno Isidro. I want all of us to be there to give our support. Maybe you could give Paeng and I a pass. This case needs our attention. Many lives depend on it. Didn't you hear me? I said we're all going. So you'll be there whether you like it or not. You're making it too obvious you don't like being around your father-in-law. You're really asking for trouble. Huh? You'll be there whether you like it or not. Do you understand? Yes, sir. You just had to say something. Sir, where is Madam Jade? Shouldn't she be here since she's running for mayor? The Congressman's getting angry. Jade actually ran in politics. For sure many farmers will lose their livelihood. It looks like she's charging your father-in-law for all the donations. Partner, what's the matter with you? I've been talking to you but you're not even listening. I have a strange feeling, partner. I know Jade. She's not the type to pass up on these kinds of events. She won't be late for no reason. Gabriela. Paeng. Sir! You do nothing but gossip. Come here! Yes, sir. Sir. Go to ma'am Jade at her house. Tell him the Congressman is looking for her. - Okay? - Yes, sir. And the event can't start without her. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. Do you know if Father Ricardo is invited? Not sure about that. I didn't notice him either. Is Victor here yet? I think we saw him earlier. But he left already. - Gabriela. - Sir. You focus. okay? Do what I told you first. That priest isn't your concern. Your priority is ma'am Jade. Okay? Yes, sir. I'm sorry. Sir. Partner, why are we here? We're supposed to go to Ma'am Jade! Sir will be angry with us. We're just picking up Father, partner. It's on the way anyway. I have a hunch. Partner, it's up to you. But this is on you. Good evening, Inspector. Are you looking for Father? Yes, that's right. We'd like to invite him to the campaign soiree. Father left around this afternoon. He didn't tell me where he was going. All right. We'll go ahead. All right. Take care. Sir. Good evening. I knew there was something fishy. Huh? I don't understand you. Let's go to Jade. We might see Father there, too. Why would Jade and Father be together? Just follow me. I'll tell you when I'm sure. Up to you. Partner, this is wrong. Jade will charge us with trespassing. Don't worry, the gate was open. And besides... Something's fishy. Like something bad's about to happen. Let's just go outside. Let's go. Why? Let's go. Let's just go. Sir. What happened to what I told you? Why aren't you with ma'am Jade? Did you tell we can't start without her? Huh? Your Jade? She's in heaven. What's her problem? Sir. I think you should just ask her. You monster! After having your way with me, this is how you treat me? What else do you want? Do you want a house, huh? A car? Land? Anything! What do you want? Don't hurt me! Get away from me! Let go-- Damn, brother. I can't believe that Congressman Isidro has the gall to run for office. That thick-faced bastard. And Miss Jade's running with him! That land-grabbing bitch! If that arrogant cop runs for office, too, I'll lose it. Remember that cop who shooed us last time? Oh, him. He's just a lackey. Is that all? Are there more? We'll have to go back and carry more later. Hey, brother. I think I cut myself. Probably scratched your head against something we carried the logs earlier. Nah, I didn't feel any pain. Paeng. Partner, how did this happen? We just saw him last night. I just thought of something. What if... I just thought of something. What if-- I already thought about that. What time did your husband come home last night? He hasn't even come home yet. Partner, be careful. The suspect we're looking for might be sleeping next to you. You just don't know it. Why are you holding my clothes? Are you gonna put them in the laundry basket? Where were you last night? What were you out all night? Where's your watch? I got home and I don't know where it is. I couldn't find it. Why do you care? What's with all these questions? Were you with Jade the whole night? I said, were you with Jade the whole night? Why are you interrogating me? Why do you care? Do you know what happened to her? She's dead. Do you have anything to do with that? You're growing a spine, huh? You're pointing a gun at me now? And you're accusing me, huh? Did you kill Jade? Partner, what happened? Huh? I got this from Victor's things. I asked him if he had anything to do with Jade's death. He didn't say anything. He just slapped me. The watch that was taken from Emily's crime scene also belongs to Victor. I didn't tell you because I wanted to be sure first. Let's go after him, sir. We can't. What about Congressman? He won't like this. Sir, grow some balls for once. You're a police officer but you're too much of a coward to enforce the law for the majority. Men. We're going after for Victor Isidro. We won't tell Congressman so as not to disrupt our operation. Yes, sir! You sure you don't want me to go in with you? I'm fine, partner. Besides, I'll just give this soup to Father and apologize for what I said last time. All right. But go straight to the safe house when you're done. For sure, your husband knows we're on to him. Sir Benjie took you off duty for your safety. Don't worry, partner. Go ahead, partner. Okay. Good day. Is Father here? I saw Father in his office earlier. Want me to call for him? That's okay. I want to surprise him with this. In that case, when he is not in his office, you can find him in his room at the end of the hallway. All right. Thank you Father? This is the cane Auring talked about. You're so embarrassing, Gabriela. He really is Father Ricardo. What are you standing around for? Close your eyes. - What is it? - Just close your eyes. Gabriela. Isn't this the ring mother gave you? When you graduated from college? Yes, I'm giving it to you for your efforts. Really? Thanks, sis. That ring symbolizes your fresh start. So before you think of doing anything stupid, just look at that ring. Think about your promise to me and mom and dad. You got it, sis. Gabriela. How are you? What does this mean? Don't tell meâ€¦ it's you? I thought it was Victor. Yes, that's right. I am God's messenger. And I also planted evidence on Victor. I thought you were smart. But you didn't notice. But you're a priest. How can you live with yourself? I'm not a priest. That's what you missed. You're not a priest? I already know. You are not Father Ricardo. Where is he? Don't look for that devil. Father Ricardo. I'm Jude, your son with Magdalena. I'm the son of that asshole with the sinful woman. Funny thing is, he didn't even know he had a son. Who the hell are you then? I am Jude Purificacion. I grew up in a big house. But I never experienced a mother's love. My mother is Magdalena Purificacion. What are you standing around for, idiot? Go cook something! Clean up! Chop-chop! I was less treated less than human. She lashes at me at the smallest mistake. Everytime I would mess up, she would lock me up. Mom! I would pray to the saints that may God send an angel to save me from my misery. Two years later, there was one incident that made it all worse. My mom got so drunk she told me why she had no love for me. Go with your father, that damned priest! I despise you! Get out of my sight! Because I am the son of Father Ricardo Baltazar. I'm her son with that priest. They say kids like me were unlucky and cursed. All my resentment towards her piled up so I killed her. While life was leaving her body, I promised myself that I would make it my mission in life to punish sinful women like her. I thought the Lord had abandoned me. But because of my bitter fate, I thought, that the Lord made me suffer this much to strengthen me. In my resilience and long-suffering, that's when His message became clear to me. He wants me to cleanse this world of evil women. Who are you to judge who should be punished? How do you know who is a sinner and who is not? I took Ricardo's identity so I can connect with people. I discovered their sins through Confession. They confided their sins to you and you killed them? It's not that simple. I tried to test them. I showed them kindness. Some of them I seduced. Those among them who were tempted by the flesh like my mother must be erased from the world. You're evil! - You're not an angel! - I'm not evil! I gave them a chance. They wished their death upon themselves. It is the Will of God. According to Hebrews chapter 9, verse 22: "In fact, the law requires that nearly everything be cleansed with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness." The mark of the stigmata represents their salvation and return to the Lord. You've gone crazy! I am not crazy! You're the crazy one. Like the rest of them. Because of what you did, I lost my beloved sister Teresita. You're a devil's spawn! You are not human! Which one is Teresita? Hang on. Let me think. Ah, Teresita. The drug addict! Why are you so upset? I gave her unimaginable pleasure before offering her to the Lord. Do you miss your sister? Would you like to be with her now? Don't worry. You'll be with her soon. Fuck you! Let me go! Partner! We've been looking for you! What happened to you? Call the others. It's Jude! He pretended to be Father Ricardo. - Huh? - He's the killer! Call everyone out here! We have a lead. Hurry up! Okay, sir! Lord God. My mission is over. I am ready to enter Your kingdom. Are you the one who killed Father Ricardo? Father and I ran into each other. I stabbed him. But I don't know how he hanged himself in the church. Where is Victor? Why are you interrogating me? I almost died! Why are you pinning this on me?
