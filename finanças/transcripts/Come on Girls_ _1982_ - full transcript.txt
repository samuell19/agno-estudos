Those three girls were really cute. they still don't know we are leaving. What should we do? That's a tough question. Let's go back to the hotel. We'll leave it to destiny. we will. it wasn't meant to be. I think this is a rare opportunity. Alright. We'll try to hitch a ride. we'll go back to our dorm. Daisuke? Okay. - Tadashi? - Either way works for me. - What? - I'm with you. which way is the tennis court? - That way. - That way? Thanks! Does that count? it doesn't. Let's see how the next car goes. What did you talk about last night? - Did he say he likes you? - We were chatting about silly things. Kumi. - Bye bye. Did you stay at the guest hall after we left? - What did you talk about? - Do you want to know? if there are owls around here. - Owls? - There are no owls. - What a silly topic. - Right! Don't laugh so much. We were serious. What else? - If there are boars around here. - Wild boars?! I'm home! - Welcome back. - Where are the boys? - They went home. - What? - Why? - They're done with their work. What time did they leave? About 30 minutes ago. We can make it. The train to Tokyo isn't coming yet. - We can catch them! - Hold on. What's wrong? I'm sorry. sorry. - What? What were you doing? Let's go. What's going on here? There's some celebrity at the tennis court. sir. Really? What kind of outfit is this? and legs are fully showing. sir. so why are you so tanned? - We're back again. - Huh? You didn't see them? Who? They went to the station to see you. Yes! Kimiaki! There's a short cut! Ryoko! They're on bikes following us! Look! please stop the bus. Going someplace? - The station. - I see. - For what? - Doesn't matter. - It does. - What's up? Is there something you want to say? Not really. but why did you get off? Because we saw you guys. Why'd you ride here on those bikes? - Cycling. - Using the bikes from Ayumi's hotel? please continue. - Okay. - Let's go back. Go back where? right? We have no money. We can't catch a train. - I'm sorry. - Why are you apologizing? We'll ask them to let us work together. Ayumi doesn't want us. That's not it. would you go back to Tokyo? - We don't know. - I want to know. Why do you want to know? This is so simple. You guys were going to the station to see us off. and chased you by bikes. and got off. we'll decide what we should do. - You're so smart. - You can borrow my money! You're such a party pooper. Daisuke. Would you go back to Tokyo if you had money? I don't want to go yet. but I don't want to go. I agree. it's like we escaped to work. let's go back. Stop being difficult. Tomorrow is Sunday. We'll take care of where you'll stay. I want to stay where we don't have to work. - I don't mind working. - No way. Stop. What's up? come here. What's wrong? My period just started. Help me. Let's go to the restroom. I want to use the bathroom. - Why? - Just need to. Can you go back the way we just came? Excuse me. - Excuse me! - Excuse me! - Nobody's here. - Yeah... What? It's open. What? - We're just using the bathroom. - Hurry up. Why are they all going together? too. Too bad girls can't pee wherever they want to. I can't either. They really should lock their doors. There are no burglars in the countryside. right? - It's really coming down. - It really is. I should bring the laundry in. huh? - You'll be a good husband. is it raining? - It is... - Sorry to make you wait. - Look at it. Wow... - What should we do? - We should leave. man. It's just a passing shower. Yeah... Is it okay to be gone from your dorm for so long? I wonder... Ask this rain. Aren't people at school worried about you? It's okay. I sent them postcards. Will you be okay for your final exams? I forgot about our finals... That sucks... But then it'll be summer vacation. You're right. okay? What's the plan for tomorrow? right? You'll be fine. Can you swim? She's not a strong swimmer. Let's decide where to meet. - How about on the bridge? - Sounds good. let's go. What happened? What are you doing here? This is my house. we took shelter from the rain here. We didn't have umbrellas. it's the lady from the tennis court. - Oh! - Why didn't you come that day? okay? What are you doing here? You'll catch a cold staying outside. then. hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up... Don't drop me. This is to thank her for letting us use her house. - Wait a little bit. - She's heavy... she said. How bold. Let's go home. there. Be careful. What do we do? They left... - I hope they still come tomorrow. - Now I'm worried. They're just jealous. Leave them alone. What are you talking about? So noisy! You're the noisy one... My shirt is tight. Loosen my buttons. too... You should just take it all off. Thank you. Take your time here. Bye bye... Thank you for helping me. - Are you okay now? - Thanks to you. What happened to those girls from before? They went home because of you. You shouldn't make girls cry. how far have you gone? Holding hands? Kissing? Making out? Or have you gone all the way? asking such questions? not really. that's all there is between boys and girls. I can see your underwear. I can't show my underwear without playing tennis? We went to the court the day after we talked to you. That's cute. I like guys who keep their promises. Those who don't are jerks. Lame. What a waste of time. Let's go. Go where? Do you have a place to stay? Hold on. Hello? It's me. Why couldn't you come? You liar. Don't lie to me. I understand. I understand... Good night. Okay... Have a drink with me. thank you. We're under age. Really? Did you get dumped? What a thing to ask. you can talk to us. I would rather cry about it than talk about it. You should cry when you want to cry. There are plenty of guys in the world. You guys are sweet. Don't ever change. May I ask your name? Saori. Miss Saori. Is it okay for us to stay here tonight? so feel free to cry all night. Alright. Good night. Good night! Good morning. That's weird... Good morning. Thank you for last night. You can stay longer if you want. I'm off to Tokyo to see my man. Saori. They must still be mad. I think so. Should we go to the hotel? though. Kids get jealous easily. Should we go back to our dorm? Let's wait a little longer. You were hiding! I'm sorry we're kids. You were eavesdropping. It's not fair. on the floor. Who was that lady? She's a nice lady. She cried all night because of trouble with a guy. solving things with him. We can stay at her place again tonight. She must really trust you. give it a rest. Let's forget about it and go to the beach. Are you bored? I'm not. You should have fun. We're at the beach. - I'll go sit there. - Whatever! What's going on? Are you tired? Yes... I see. huh? I told him not to worry about me. he said I must be mad about last night. He thinks everyone needs to feel the way he feels. Daisuke looks happier when he's with Kumi. That's only because they're playing right now. - Right? - Yes. Can you put some oil on my back? let's make something. - What do you want? - Something delicious. - Are you good at cooking? I am. can you make me a coffee? No milk or sugar. Just black. - Kimiaki. - What? Let's talk. What are you up to? Do you like Ayumi more than Kumi? When did we decide who goes with who? - We all know. - I don't know. We got paired up by pulling lots. - You're the one who cheated. - Cheated?! that was a cheat. You decided everything. Of course I'm pissed. Didn't seem to bother you at the time. I was following your lead. And I hate that about you! I hate how you try to act cool! - Ayumi even said so at the beach. - What did she say? You're wishy-washy. Come on! Bastard! Leave them alone. Don't pull your punches. too. -You missed a spot. - Where? Hey! Have a seat. Do you think that's Saori? Hello? Saori. we're having fun. that's nice. I got it. good luck. Good bye. Saori said she met with her boyfriend. I'm glad. She said to give the house key to the property manager. I'm glad she's happy now. You don't even know her. I wonder what her boyfriend is like. - He must be a handsome guy. - More handsome than us? I feel like this is the end of summer vacation. But it hasn't even started yet. I'd look forward to seeing the entire movie. Will you be back to see me during summer vacation? I will. No falling asleep. - I'm just thinking. - About what? About the day we met. that. I had hoped I'd get you. it's true. too. We were lucky. I really like you. Daisuke. Don't scare me. Promise you won't get angry. - I won't. - Promise? I promise. - Why do you have this? - I'm sorry. I found it. you'd leave. I didn't want you to go. I'm very sorry for hiding this for so long. I thought my love was one-sided. too. Let's meet tomorrow. Tomorrow is Monday. you have school... Over here! - Tadashi! - Kimiaki! take care! - Tadashi! - Kimiaki! Daisuke! Come again! Bye bye! Written and Directed by: Yoshimitsu Morita THE END
