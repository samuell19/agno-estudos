Don't tell me you didn't know about Sasada's speech competition either. Speech competition? Oh, come on. You don't have to bring that up. Sasada's participating in a prefectural competition! We were talking about going to cheer her on. Really? That's incredible. Kitamoto, Tanuma, wanna come with? Sure, sounds good. I'm in. We should invite Taki too and all go together! Come on, give it a rest already! Mr. Nomiya is on the committee for the competition, and he just asked me to compete so he wouldn't look bad. So, did you decide on a topic yet? Well, that's... still a secret. Oh? Sounds to me like you still haven't decided! Yes, I have! Are you sure? I'm not a slacker like you, you know. See you. Yeah. Bye. It's so hot. Let's get some ice cream on the way home. This is bad. Someone's following me. Could they be after the Book of Friends? Sorry, guys. I think I forgot something. I have to go back. Huh? Were you half-asleep and forgot to pack everything up? Seems like it. See you! Yeah! See you later, Natsume. Did I lose it? Now, what do we have here? You're Natsume of the Book of Friends, are you not? Oh no! I am told that the one in possession of it can control the spirits whose names are written within. How fortuitous that I would meet you here! Now, hand over the Book of Friends! Stop! A pincer attack? Come, give it to me. Who goes there?! Get off me! Curse you! That one belongs to me. Leave! Weakling. Master Nyanko! Jeez. I saw you running off in a hurry, and then I find you in this mess. Thank you, Master. The bodyguard fee won't be cheap. Or so I'd like to say, but I'll let you off the hook this time with one fried shrimp. Oh, right. Thank you too. Hey! Are you listening, Natsume?! Hey. Are you Master Natsume? Yes, that's right. I am one who goes by the name of Monmonbou. I have come to beg you to return my name, Master Natsume of the Book of Friends. Just so you know, I'm not Reiko. That much I can tell. Natsume Reiko would never be captured so pathetically by a spirit that weak. Reiko has passed away. This is her grandson. Is that truly so? So, you want your name back? Let's go somewhere else. Are you able to leave the wall? Well, in that case... I was made aware that Natsume had recently come back to this area and was returning names, so I traveled three months from far away to come here. Oh? Where did you come from? I hail from the town of Gochou. Huh? Gochou? Really? Even Natsume could walk there in under half a day. You see, I traveled here by following the walls. Seems like you're able to walk outside walls just fine to me. Yes, but you see, I am of a rather shy disposition. Shy? I feel more comfortable inside the walls. I am alone, unseen by all and without fear of being attacked by other spirits. Has Reiko been to Gochou before, then? Natsume Reiko only visited for a short span of time, but rumors of a fearsome human picking on spirits even made their way inside the walls. My grandmother, Natsume Reiko, possessed vast spiritual power, and she would challenge any spirit she came across. It's Natsume Reiko! Run away! She'll pick us off and eat us! Upon beating them, as proof of them becoming her underlings, she'd make them write down their names, which she collected. A bundle of contracts that can force spirits whose names are called to oblige unconditionally: The Book of Friends. {\pos(477,741)\fscx57\fscy54\frz-29.6\fax0.26\fnBrush Strokes\c&H303832&\blur0.65}Book of Friends {\pos(518,515)\fscx57\fscy54\frz-23.33\fax0.16\fnBrush Strokes\c&H303832&\blur0.65}Book of Friends {\pos(570,292)\fscx61\fscy54\frz-18.17\fax0.05\fnBrush Strokes\c&H303832&\blur0.65}Book of Friends {\pos(623,245)\fscx58\fscy54\frz-20.12\fax-0.05\fnBrush Strokes\c&H303832&\blur0.65}Book of Friends {\pos(682,196)\fscx54\fscy54\frz-21.74\fax-0.17\fnBrush Strokes\c&H303832&\blur0.65}Book of Friends {\pos(761,208)\fscx54\fscy54\frz-23.96\fax-0.34\fnBrush Strokes\c&H303832&\blur0.65}Book of Friends {\pos(798,214)\fscx54\fscy54\frz-25.84\fax-0.41\fnBrush Strokes\c&H303832&\blur0.65}Book of Friends {\pos(816,220)\fscx54\fscy54\frz-26.05\fax-0.46\fnBrush Strokes\c&H303832&\blur0.65}Book of Friends {\pos(826,221)\fscx54\fscy54\frz-26.73\fax-0.48\fnBrush Strokes\c&H303832&\blur0.65}Book of Friends {\pos(836,225)\fscx54\fscy54\frz-27.16\fax-0.5\fnBrush Strokes\c&H303832&\blur0.65}Book of Friends Having inherited it from Reiko, I am chased by spirits seeking its power, and I come across spirits who wish to have their names returned. My life has become rather hectic. You who protect me, show me your name. I return your name, Monmonbou. Hold up! Isn't that her? The scary girl who moved here recently. Just look at her. Her legs are covered with scars. Oh no, she's talking to herself! That's so creepy! You've been hiding and watching, haven't you? I could tell. Say, would you like to fight me? She decided that we would compete using a human game called "wall tag," but Reiko wasn't aware of the rules either, so we decided that if she could drag me out of the wall by sunset, we would count it as her win. You're fast at running away! I underestimated you! I've got y? Here. I win. Perhaps having these experiences one after another made her give up on interacting with people. Thank you very much. I will now return to Gochou. Take care. I also lost my parents, so I was passed around by my relatives, but I ended up in the care of the kind Fujiwaras. Shigeru, would you like some more rice? Thanks, about half is fine. All right. Have some sides too. This is really nice. Oh, Takashi. Did you already eat all of your fried shrimp? You sure are a quick eater. Huh? Oh, yes. It was so good that I couldn't help myself. There's still some left, so do help yourself. All right. I'll have another, then. At first I wasn't sure how to interact with them, and there were times I acted distant or didn't know what to do, but step by step, we became more like family. Takashi, could you go on an errand for me? Sure, no problem. Where to? It's in Gochou, so it should take you about 20 minutes. Gochou? I was supposed to return this, but I have to go to a town meeting instead. Got it. I'm off! Bye! Stay safe! Sure! You seem to be in high spirits, Master. The mid-ranks said they found some rare sake, so I'm off to do a bit of tasting. You're not coming with me? Sure aren't. Don't go meddling in things that don't concern you while I'm not around. I'll be back for dinner, so leave some of Touko's cooking for me!

Thank you for helping me. Sorry, but... You wouldn't happen to know someone called Natsume Reiko, would you? Huh? Who in the world are you? I'm Natsume Takashi. Reiko is my grandmother. My! She had a grandson? Right this way. Thank you for inviting me in. I'm home. Do we have a guest, Mom? Yes, that's right. He's the grandson of an old acquaintance. Really? Uh... Welcome.

So my grandmother lived around here too. Back when I was still in middle school, it was the talk of the town that a weird older girl had moved here. My friends gathered all kinds of stories about her, and we'd all watch her in secret on the way home from school, hoping to see something unusual. Oh, we were just so curious about this older girl. But she left as quickly as she came. Really? What was your grandfather like? Huh? I'm just curious what kind of person Reiko married. Oh, I actually don't know either. I lost my parents when I was young, and I was never told anything about my family. I see. So I was hoping to hear from someone who knew my grandmother. I'm sorry I couldn't be of any help. But just once... Huh? Oh, no, it's nothing. Oh my. What was that noise? Oh dear, what a mess. I was planning on preparing some tea for our guest... I already made some tea. Right? Huh? Really? Uh, yes. Oh, what will I do with you? Oh dear! Come on, Mom... Ouch. A-Are you all right? It's always like this. My son's just so clumsy. I inherited it from you. You think so? Yes, no question. That's my mom's workshop. She's a paper cutting artist. Really? Want to see? Wow. Look, this one won her an award at an exhibition. It's nothing impressive, though. I started helping her recently, but I'm still so bad at it. You'll overtake me soon enough. That's just not happening. I could never beat you. You met someone who knew Reiko? It was a strange feeling. In the memory, well... She wasn't very nice toward Reiko. But she had a family like anyone else, and it's difficult to accept that even I found it heartwarming. You sure like to make things complicated. Anyway, Natsume, the smell of a spirit is coming from you. Where'd you pick that up? Huh? Oh, I saw a weird one on the way home. I'm surprised you could tell. I hope you haven't picked up a strange curse or two again. If you're that worried, why don't you come with me to see if it's a dangerous one? Why do I have to go out my way for something like that? You're my bodyguard, remember? I'm not going, and that's final!

Up until last year, there was an unused building at our school. An old, wooden building filled with the memories of those who studied there before us. We never had a single class in that building. But it holds a single memory precious to me. Sasada spoke of her memory of a spirit she met in the old school building. I had lost a memento of my mother and returned to the old school building alone, desperately trying to find it. But then, someone showed up to help me. Sasada mentioned nothing of it being a spirit, instead retelling the story as if it was a human. She never directly saw the spirit, but even so, they were able to understand each other to some extent. The place from my memory no longer exists. All things with a form are fated to break, and memories of them may gradually fade and then one day disappear. Even so, this experience helped me understand the kindness of others, and I was able to slowly change how I interact with them. That change is a small ripple that will expand even further with time. I realized this is what makes the world spin. Every time I see the plot where the old school building once stood, I will reflect upon that again. {\an7\pos(0,0)\c&HCCB9A8&\blur0.5\p1}m 472 129 l 808 129 808 165 472 165 {\pos(640,146)\fscx52\fscy60\fnIwata Mincho Pro M-Kami\c&H59544C&\blur0.6}68th High School Speech Competition Sasada, congratulations on winning bronze. Your closing words really touched me. Thank you, Taki. I thought you were just angry all the time, but stuff like this goes through your head too, huh? What do you mean, "angry all the time"? Thank you, Natsume. Huh? Sure. Natsume? Yuuki, what's up? Yuuki? Could you be that Yuuki? No way... Are you actually Natsume? Yeah. Back in elementary school? Come on, Yuuki. Let's go. Coming. Who was that? Some old friend? I know someone from that school. Want me to ask about him? No, it's fine. What's wrong, Natsume? Your stomach not agree with something? I'm not you. I was just lost in thought. Hmph. I bet you're just worrying about something pointless as usual. I met someone I used to go to school with today. Oh? And like with that brat Shibata, I bet he was extremely nasty about it, reminding you of everything bad that happened back then. No, not quite. But... True, it wasn't exactly a pleasant memory. Isn't that him? The liar boy. Apparently he does nothing but lie all the time. Make sure to stay away from him. That Daisuke is bad news. You're an impostor, aren't you? Huh? You're not actually human. Yuuki would say strange things, so he didn't fit in well at school. He would talk to me from time to time, and at some point we ended up walking home together. Is Natsume an alien too? Whoa, for real? Daisuke, welcome home. That's not my real mother. It's an alien. Stop spouting nonsense and go inside. Hey, so... You can see them, right? I can see them too. The ghosts. The child I was, I took Yuuki for his word. On a mountain in the town that few people visited, there was a waterfall, and according to legend, demons live there. Yuuki suggested we go and have a look. Oh, bummer. Huh? Do not touch that! That is the flow of human life. If someone like you touches it, the flow will change. Each and every stream of water rules over encounters and partings, the very fate of humans. Be careful. The world of humans is a frail thing, where even a small action like that can change it. Let's try hitting the wall. Huh? Maybe some water will come out. No, don't! Soon after that I once more transferred schools, and we never saw each other again. Sheesh. I told you not to meddle in things that don't concern you, but you never listen. I'm not trying to meddle. I'm just a bit concerned about the demon I saw before. That's what meddling means! Got it, Natsume? I'm just helping out this once. Yes, I'm thankful, Master. Hey, Natsume. I can smell something sweet and delicious. Let's take a detour. I can't do that. I don't have much allowance left this month. How irresponsible can you be? Whose fault do you think it is?! This is all because I bought you a meat bun from Nanatsujiya for today's bodyguard fee! What was that?! Are you trying to lay the blame on me?! Oh well, I guess I'll let you go. Hi there. Mukuo?! Huh? Could it be that you don't know how to ride? Yeah. Do you know how, Takashi? I'm not very good at it, but I'm practicing. We're the same, then. Let's both keep at it. Absolutely. But how come you were practicing out there? If I did it near the house, Mom would see me.

Is there nothing I can do to make Natsume buy some for me? Oh man. Do you see that thing? What's that round lump of mass supposed to be? Seems like it's wanting some dumplings, but it's basically a nice and plump dumpling itself. Calling it a pig would be rude to pigs! You there! Who do you think you're talking about?! Run away! Stop running away! How impertinent for a pig cat! He's fast for a pig cat! Hold it right there! Oh, would you stop moving about! I hope you've said your prayers. That store was kind enough to put one of Mom's paper cuttings on display. Oh. I know. Why don't you come over and watch her make one? Are you sure? I'd love to. It's always just the two of us. So if I went away... Huh? That always crosses my mind, and then I feel like I have to stay. Oh... There's a small shrine down this way belonging to a god named Nanten. I see. There's a legend that he will alter any misfortune you come across, so she would always go there when something had happened. Not just hardships, but good things too. She would go there to relate anything and everything. I'm done. You can't see anything in the parts that were cut away, but... I just love seeing something appear where there was nothing. Here, this is for you. Huh? Are you sure? I know it was made a bit impromptu. Thank you so much! Hey! Stop running! You're not getting away with this! Oh, this is too bothersome! Going on a rampage for the first time in a while made me thirsty. I'll make Natsume buy me one of those fizzy drinks. Thank you for having me. You're welcome back anytime you like. Thank you. Bye, then. Master! There you are! Where were you loitering? You're way too old to be getting lost. That's what I should be saying! That demon didn't appear today. You have the smell of a spirit coming from you again. Huh? It must've been hiding in the vicinity. Huh? Master, you've got something on you. It looks like some kind of seed. I'm home! What's wrong, Natsume? What is that strange tree?! Why are you asking me that? Do you have any ideas, Master? Don't tell me it's the seed from yesterday! On closer inspection, doesn't that fruit resemble you a bit? It looks nothing like me! Don't compare my pretty, calculated form to some crude, wild fruit like that! What should I tell Shigeru and Touko? Is something the matter, Takashi? Why are you staring at the sky? Is there something there? Huh? They can't see the tree? Oh, it's nothing. I was just admiring the clear skies. Yes. It looks like we're in for a hot day. I'm going now. Me too. Bye! Have fun! Master is at home, so it should be fine. But what if it's a harmful tree? I hear there are spirit trees that grow after coming in contact with spirit energy. Did coming into contact with me expedite its growth? But still, the more I look... the tastier it seems. It'd be dangerous to leave it around and have it grow even larger. I might as well... just eat it here and now! What a delicacy. What?! You ate the fruit growing on the tree?! It was truly delicious. Are you all right, Master? Don't worry, spirit fruit is nothing unusual. And as a result the tree disappeared. This is cause for celebration if anything! Well, that may be true... See, that's what you get. Shouldn't you try to keep still, Master? Master? Master, calm down! You can't talk? I don't want to admit it, but they're kind of cute. Takashi! What's wrong? You'll be late! Okay! I'll be right there! What do I do? If Touko finds these... My! Nyankichi had children? And three at that! This'll become a headache. Master, just stay put for a bit. Here, your lunch. Thank you. Did you hear something? No, nothing. I'm off! Bye! I really can't just leave things like this... I don't have a choice! This is no laughing matter! Oh, Master Madara, what an unfortunate form you've taken on. Unfortune smiles upon you. I'm sorry, Natsume. But this is just too... This certainly took me off guard. This only happened due to your endless gluttony. If he got food poisoning from eating a spirit fruit, I'm sure he will get better soon. Is that how it works? It'd be a huge help if we could at least figure out where the seed came from, but if he can't speak... How about trying to change into Master Madara's original form? No luck, huh? Oh, I have to go. Anyway, please take care of Master until I'm back from school. Understood! You can leave everything to the Natsume Gang, the Party of Dogs! We'll see if we can figure out a way to turn him back. I will lend you my help. Thank you! Now then... Natsume! You're just late. Hurry to your desk. I'm sorry! Nishimura! Here! What happened? You oversleep? Yeah, a bit. Ready, and... That didn't work. One, two, three, lid. Here we go. All green. Great, I'll take care of this. How unfortunate. Pitcher! Wind up! Throw! I hoped he'd go back to normal from the impact... No change, no change. Now then, what should we try next? Oh no! They're running away! Hey, hold on! We're doing this for your sake! Wait! Wait, wait! What?! One of them ran away?! Indeed. We looked for him all over, but we just couldn't find Number 1. Which one's Number 1?! This is Number 2, and this is Number 3. This is bad. Where could he have gone? We are terribly sorry, Sir Natsume. In any case, he probably can't turn back without all three being together. I'm sure he'll come back sooner or later. It's Madara we're talking about here. There's no need to worry. That's true. Understand, Number 2, Number 3? You have to stay put when we get home. Make sure you don't let Shigeru or Touko see you. Natsume! Oh, Tanuma. Nishimura said you left in a hurry to take care of something. What's up? Is it something demon-related again? Yeah, the thing is... Let's talk over there. What?! There are two of Master! And they're tiny! There's actually one more of them. There are three?! How did this happen? Well... I see. That's cause for concern. It's Master we're talking about, so I'm sure he'll figure something out himself, but... Natsume. I'll help you look for him. Thank you, Tanuma. All right, see you tomorrow. Yeah. Bye. I'm happy I could tell Tanuma everything. Just the fact that he knows what I can see is very reassuring. Come again! Huh? Was that Master Nyanko just now? But he looked kind of small... Master Nyanko! Look, it's tiny! It's so weird! Look at that. Isn't that Natsume's cat? Huh? I don't think so. Natsume's is way larg? No, wait. That's Natsume's... ...ugly cat. Taki? Master!

Number 3 disappeared too? And that's not all. Things are a bit strange. Shigeru and Touko seem to think that this is how large Master Nyanko was to begin with. Huh? What could that... Hey! Tanuma! Natsume! Good morning. Oh, the ugly cat. I saw him yesterday. What? Really? Yeah. We weren't sure at first, but that was definitely your cat. And then she ran after it... Uh, I can't remember her name... Yes, that girl! Huh? What was her name again? You know, the cute one in class 5... She's friends with Sasada. Are you talking about Taki? Yes, exactly! How could I forget her name? They saw Taki? {\pos(128,70)\fscx29\fscy29\frz-5.19\fax0.07\fnPolo\b1\c&H151D28&\blur0.55}Taki Don't you find this strange? I can't imagine Nishimura or Kitamoto would forget Taki. Actually, my memory of her is getting a bit fuzzy too. I'm supposed to know about Taki, but it's like she doesn't feel real. What?! Tanuma, could you try asking around in your class and see if they remember Taki? Sure. This is where I first met Master. A human who can look at me and not bat an eye? How insolent. Aren't you Natsume Reiko? Do you remember, Master? Oh, Sir Natsume! Impeccable timing! The kappa on the other side of the river said they saw a piggy cat like Number 3 walking that way this morning. Really? Thank you. I believe Number 1 headed in the same direction... Toward Gochou? Hinoe, Mustache. Could you take care of Number 2? It'd be bad if we got separated far away from home. Sure, I don't mind. But where are you going? Well... I'm going to find where the seed came from. Maybe I can figure something out. Could the scrambled memories of my friends also be related to Master's disappearance? But how come it doesn't affect me or the ones in Yatsuhara? Could it be that if all three disappear, even I will forget about Master? You there. A mere child of man who's able to see us?! Have you seen a fat, round cat like this? It's the gluttonous pig cat from before! That's it! Could you tell me where you saw him? Takashi! Are you here to visit again? Oh, no. I'm here on a different errand. Aw, I thought I'd get to see Mom smile. Sorry. You know... Mom wants to see something the naked eye can't see. She wants to express something beyond the colors and forms of this world. She said that's why she picked up paper cutting. But with how she is, I just can't leave her alone. I'd be scared for her if I wasn't around. Right... She's always been withdrawn, but she's strong inside. Her relationships didn't always work out, and she had me without ever getting married, so someone has to stay by her side. Well, I'm going this way. Come visit again sometime. Sure. Perhaps he takes after his mother. There's something inexplicable about Mukuo, just like Yorie. Thinking back, I'm pretty sure Master came out of the woods. So this path connects to that slope. But is it actually true? The elder's familiar really was sighted here? A well-informed exorcist I know told me. There's no mistaking it. Exorcists! It's been more than ten years since the elder died. The poor thing. If his familiar is here, perhaps the legendary spirit the elder was after is here too. I just hope we can find it before the Matoba clan gets word of this. Matoba... Never forget. Even on days when I don't appear in the reflection of your eyes, you appear in the reflection of my heart. You got the okay! Natori, that's a wrap for you! Great work! Good job. Thank you. Excuse me, Natori. You were supposed to have the day off tomorrow, but do you mind if I schedule an interview? Sorry, I can't do tomorrow. Could we do another day? Understood. I'll see what I can do. I believe your ride is here. Thanks. Let's go. I never managed to find Master in the end. I'll go look for him again tomorrow together with Tanuma. {\pos(88,140)\fscx56\fscy56\frz1.01\fax-0.02\fnPolo\fsp1\b1\c&H182220&\1a&H0F&\blur0.8}F uji wa 24261b">ra {\pos(88,140)\fscx56\fscy56\frz1.01\fax-0.02\fnPolo\fsp1\b1\c&H182220&\1a&H0F&\blur0.8\clip (m 90 157 l 93 148 96 138 98 132 99 135 101 152 100 159 106 159 110 141 115 113 149 115 146 180)}Fuj 222419">iwa color="#24261b">ra {\pos(88,140)\fscx56\fscy56\frz1.01\fax-0.02\fnPolo\fsp1\b1\c&H182220&\1a&H0F&\blur0.8\clip (m 52 154 l 53 144 55 133 57 121 32 108 31 161)}Fu color="#212319">jiw ara {\pos(88,140)\fscx56\fscy56\frz1.01\fax-0.02\fnPolo\fsp1\b1\c&H182220&\1a&H0F&\blur0.8\clip (m 105 157 l 106 148 107 139 111 125 50 97 20 126 34 184)}Fu ji 23251a">war color="#25271b">a {\pos(88,140)\fscx56\fscy56\frz1.01\fax-0.02\fnPolo\fsp1\b1\c&H182220&\1a&H0F&\blur0.8}F uji wa 24261b">ra I'm home. Huh? And who are you? Huh? What's the matter, Shigeru? Who is that boy? I'm Takashi! Natsume Takashi! Touko! Shigeru! What? Takashi is sitting right there. You're an impostor, aren't you? Master? Master, where are you?! You're here, right?! Come out! Master! Master! Where did you go? Master! I asked a few people about Taki, but they all said they didn't know who that is. I see. I'm starting to feel the same more and more. Maybe there's some kind of demon who steals memories, and when I imagine it trying to erase Taki from everyone's memories, I just get scared, Natsume. Tanuma... Master! Yorie and Mukuo's house... It couldn't be. All right, Tooru. Look after the house while I'm away. Oh, Takashi. Yorie? My, he looks just like our Master Nyanko. Huh? Master Nyanko? Yes, that's the name of our cat. Auntie, I can go and buy food for Master inst? Taki! Huh? Who are you? Natsume... and Tanuma. I'm sorry. But I feel like I know you. I can at least tell that you're not suspicious. How come you're here? Tooru and I are related. She found Master for us. That's right. I spotted Master and ran after him... Wait! Master! Huh? Why... am I here? Oh? Is something wrong? You found Master for us! Wait, aren't we related somehow? I'm Taki... Tooru. Auntie... So we decided to have her stay here until she feels better. We got permission from her parents. Yeah. What do you think? Just... ...a little... ...bit further. Oh right, Natsume. Why don't we take Master out for some fresh air? G-Good idea, Tanuma. Master, you just spoke, didn't you? Why was he able to earlier? Maybe... We've had... ...a terrible time. Wh-Wh-Why?! I see. Apparently... ...we can speak normally... ...when placed like this. I'm not sure I'd call that normal. Master, how did this happen? Apparently some strange... ...property was dwelling in the tree... ...that fruit grew on. Strange property? That's... probably my fault. Mukuo? Natsume, do you still... ...not get it? He's the source... ...of the smell... ...that you brought home... ...with you before. Huh? He's... ...a spirit. What?! I'm sorry. I've caused trouble for that girl as well. So you're the very person... ...responsible for imbuing... ...the tree with that... ...strange power. We had an awful experience... ...thanks to you! Please explain what's going on. I'm not the real Mukuo. Her son, Tsumura Mukuo, died eight years ago. I was placed under a jinx, and I'm fated to walk the land of humans. Jinx? I originally served a mountain god, and in order to inform them about the lives of the villagers, I was granted the power to mimic the appearance of humans. But one day I committed a sin, was punished, and forced to wander. For example, if I came upon a new place and spoke to someone, I would become someone who was there originally. Uh, you're... Oh, if it isn't Hiro. Welcome back. At times I would become a real person who used to live there, and other times someone completely fictional. Rather than altering memories, it's as if the world itself completely changes for duration that I'm there. But if I leave, everything goes back to how it was before, and everyone forgets about me. They all forget, no matter how close we were. Now that's an... ...outrageous jinx. That mountain god must be... ...tremendously powerful. Be careful. The world of humans is a frail thing, where even a small action like that can change it. Natsume? Oh, I'm fine. However, spirits, as well as those who can see them like Takashi, are unaffected. So that's why my memory didn't change. So, to avoid the attention of exorcists, I made sure to never stay in one place for too long. No, that's a lie. More than exorcists, I was worried I'd become attached if I stayed somewhere too long. Having tired of my fate, I decided to end it all, to become part of this tree. And so I entered the hollow. Grandpa, who lives in this house? It belongs to Nanten. Nanten? That's right. Even if misfortune befalls us, he will alter it into something better. That's why we pray here. The god of that shrine had already left for elsewhere long ago. But she believed in the legend that her grandfather told her only once, and I would watch over her as she came to share anything, be it good or bad. But... I'd never seen her like that before. It looked to me as if she was about to disappear. I became curious about what'd happened to her... I left the hollow and chased after her. And then... There was a spirit there. You're safe, Mukuo! Welcome home. That's when I understood. Her only son had just passed away in a mountain-climbing accident, and in that moment, I'd become that son. The presence of that spirit also bothered me, and in order to protect her, I decided to stay as Mukuo for a while. A spirit fated to roam aimlessly... I never noticed, since I'd just stayed cooped up. But my jinx may have possessed this tree. That fruit... ...taking after... ...my pretty figure... ...must've been... ...a result of your... ...ability to mimic others. And then you became affected by the jinx too. But why did he split into three? The three fruits... ...must've picked up... ...slightly different parts... ...of my personality... ...and something went wrong. And because that girl came here with one of the cats, she ended up affected too. Jeez, your gluttony even got Taki involved. What was that?! What can we do to turn Taki back to normal? Both Taki and Master have people waiting for them back home. This is my fault. So I'll have to fix it somehow. Do you have something in mind? If I return the jinx of that tree and the cat, then probably... That's possible? It will require power from me, but it should work out. After all, the jinx was originally part of me. But first, we need to get all three cats here. We thought so too... ...which is why... ...we all tried... ...to come here. Will the third one come here if we wait, then? That should... ...be the case, but perhaps something... ...happened to him? Why didn't the three of you stick together?! It's because he wouldn't stay put. It's because he wouldn't stay put. Stop fighting among yourselves. A-Anyway, let's split up and look for him, Natsume. Take one of us... ...each to look. Huh? We can recognize... ...his presence if we get close. Gotcha. We'll find him and come back here! See you in a bit! Yeah! Just as he might be able to form relationships, he leaves the place behind. He roams, unable to form any real bonds. But Mukuo finally found a place for himself. If I were to leave the Fujiwaras, and Shigeru and Touko forgot about me... But to Yorie, would her years spent with Mukuo all have been a lie? I can't stay here any longer, huh? Oh dear, were you always this clumsy? S-Sorry. Don't worry. You'll get better with practice. Here, hold down closer to where you're cutting... Mom... {\pos(710,123)\fscx66\fscy66\fnGingerline DEMO\xshad-0.8\yshad-0.8\c&H3E5246& \4c&H252E27&\1a&HFE&\blur1}Left {\pos(710,123)\fscx66\fscy66\fnGingerline DEMO\shad1.5\c&H4A5955&\4c&HB9D0CF&\blur1} Left {\pos(797,187)\fscx73\fscy73\fnGingerline DEMO\xshad-0.8\yshad-0.8\c&H3E5246& \4c&H252E27&\1a&HFE&\blur1}Yatsuhara {\pos(797,187)\fscx73\fscy73\fnGingerline DEMO\shad1.5\c&H4A5955&\4c&HB9D0CF&\blur1} Yatsuhara If he's coming from Yatsuhara, it's this path. That's... Natori! Natsume! Why are you here? That's what I'd like to ask you. I see. Master Nyanko ate a spirit fruit and turned into this. Sorry, sorry. How dare you do that to my master! Are you here for work? Yeah, I'm looking for the familiar of a deceased exorcist. With this guy's help. You wouldn't happen to be referring to someone called "the elder," would you? How did you know that? Don't tell me you're meddling in things you shouldn't again. I'm not meddling! I just happened to overhear some exorcists talking about him close to here. All right. That familiar's name is Habaki, and we recently found out it's in this area. The elder's family asked me to set it free. I'm here to relieve it from its duty as a familiar. I also heard that the spirit he'd been chasing might be here. Yes, the elder was somewhat of an eccentric, and he spent years chasing a demon that might not even exist. I don't know if that's it, but I saw a spirit wearing a strange mask flying through the sky. Where did you see it? It was near the fire lookout tower. Hiiragi. Yes, I'll go and look. Thank you, Natsume. That's probably Habaki. It might still be wandering in search of the spirit, not knowing that the elder passed away. As for the other spirit, I hear it's cruel and blends in with humans, only to steal their memories of time spent together. Do you have someone in mind? No. I have to go and look for Master. All right. I'll let you know if I find him. Thank you. See you. Yeah. See you, Natsume. The masked spirit was after Mukuo, not Yorie. Would it have been better to tell Natori everything? But... explaining everything would've felt like tattling. As if I was betraying Mukuo. He just keeps getting away. Just keeps hopping away. I feel bad for Natsume, but perhaps it's better for Master Madara's parts to live out their lives separated, and we'll hold a gathering to go all-out reminiscing about Master Madara! We'll drink! Yeah, we'll drink! Pardon. Huh? Were you just speaking of Master Natsume and Master Madara? As I was traveling along the walls on my way to the town of Gochou, what do I see if not a small Master Madara bouncing along, passing me. And then... Huh? Where did you come from, kitty? Mommy! I found a kitty! What? I did my best to follow them... Over there. Oh! That is none other than Number 3! Being trapped in a human house... Master Madara has no luck. Therein lies the rub. The scrub? Anyway, we have to rescue Master Madara for Master Natsume's sake! What do we do? What do we rue? Well... Oh! Now that's an idea! Quietly, quietly... Quickly, quickly... Carefully... ...open. Mommy. There are frogs on the kitty's head. What? Master Madara! Come here, quick! This way! Kitty, no! It's dangerous outside! What?! There are two kitties! Master Nyanko! Ponta! Where are you? Master Nyanko! Hello. It's right there, Master. Well done, Hiiragi. Here I go. Borrowing the power of the land, I command you. The chains of wind, the binding light, come forth! Oh, there it is! Oh no! Sasago, Urihime, Hiiragi! Oh, it ripped. For places that are difficult to cut, try bending the paper instead. Okay. Like this? Yes, exactly. Oh, Mukuo! Hi. You come over here too. We'll do it together. Sorry. I have somewhere I need to be. Really? Goodbye, Mom. Have fun, Mukuo. Natsume! Tanuma! Number 2! Number 3! What a relief. Tanuma, thank you. Let's hurry. Yeah. Exorcists. Huh? I'm sure it flew this way. Over there! Look! Oh, there it is! Hurry after it! What's wrong? You stay with Taki. A dangerous demon might be attacking. Got it! Don't do anything dangerous, Natsume! Mukuo! Takashi. Thank goodness. You found them all. Yes. But never mind that. Exorcists are coming! Huh? The masked demon is coming this way. The exorcists are chasing after it. After that spirit? Why? It wasn't after Yorie. It was a familiar chasing you! I see. I had no idea... Its exorcist master has already passed away, and it remained behind with the order still in effect. Takashi, could I ask you a favor? Of course. I'd like my name back. Huh? My name is there in the Book of Friends. I'll take on the full extent of the jinx, and then leave this place. That way everything will be back to how it was. But then Yorie will forget about you. That can't be avoided. Are you going to leave Yorie behind all alone?! I see what's going on. Natori! So he's the memory-stealing spirit. Please wait! He's not the kind of cruel demon you're imagining! You think? But isn't he deceiving that Yorie you spoke of even now? That may be the case, but the eight years that he lived with Yorie were precious to the both of them. Wouldn't stealing that from her be the real cruelty here? It's fine, Takashi. What I did is something that isn't allowed. So... So it's time to return Mukuo to her. There it is! That way! Wait! After it! That takes care of the nuisance for the time being. Are you sure you shouldn't be exorcising that spirit? I was only asked to take care of the familiar. Besides, the reason the elder chased after that spirit wasn't necessarily to exorcise it. Master, I'm going on ahead. Yeah, I'm counting on you! Thank you, Hiiragi, Sasago, Urihime! You who protect me, show me your name. I return your name, Honokage. Hey, you there. What are you doing cooped up in there? I know about you. You're always hiding in there, right? Can you see me? In my own form? Of course I can. Your feathers are beautiful. I see. Thank you. I originally dwelled in a relief carved on the shrine of a mountain god. I copied the forms of those who came to pray, to show to the mountain god as part of my duty. In my happiness of meeting a human other than exorcists who can see me, I recounted to Reiko how I came to be here. After I finished talking, this is how she responded. I like the sound of that! No one remembers you. Huh? I don't want anyone to remember me. Anyway, how would you like to fight me? If you lose, write your name on this paper. After I wrote my name, Reiko never came here again. Even so, I decided to remember her. Even if she forgot me, I wanted to remember her. Master! What's going on here?! Just calm down, will you?! Oh no! Natsume! Natsume! Natori! Thank goodness. Hold on. I'll get you some help. I'm fine. Just start the ceremony to break the contract! Natsume! Master, thank you. I swear, you're a handful. You always find trouble. I owe you one. Let's hurry back now! You didn't have to tell me that! Natori! Good work, everyone. Leave the rest to me. Listen, your master has passed away. It's time to be free. I recite in place of the one who spun the laws of the world. Lift the spell, release the provisional name, and return it to whence it came. I here bear witness to the unraveling of the ties of your contract. Takashi. The grief that I held back will be her burden to bear and overcome. I'd be happy if you watched over her in my place as she does that. I promise I will. Maybe it was no jinx after all. If not for it, I would never have experienced such happy times. I will probably never return to the world of humans again. This is... H-How cute. Master, what's happening? It seems Natsume and the others did their part. This must be the power from the tree seeping out. Just look. It's disappearing. Great job, everyone! Good job! Silver grass and dragonflies, huh? It sure is fall. Fall, fall! It seems we haven't had enough to drink. Let's drink! Oh? What's going on? Taki. Tanuma! Huh? What am I doing here? I spotted Master Nyanko, and then... Huh? Welcome back, Natsume. Natsume! Taki. Thank goodness. I'm sorry. I... Master Nyanko! I missed you so much! Wait! Master Nyanko! Wait, wait! Just let me hold your for a bit! All right, got you! So fluffy! Yorie? I'm coming in. Yorie? Oh, Takashi. What's the matter with me? This isn't like me. I suddenly remembered Mukuo. Isn't it strange? It's been over eight years already. Taki's memories are back to normal. In return, all memories concerning Honokage have disappeared from Taki and Tanuma's minds. Yorie turned into simply a passerby who helped Taki. I now have a place to come home to. A place dear to me. My. So Reiko kept it all this time. Yes. Back then, people would find Reiko a bit scary. I'm really sorry. But, you see, to us middle schoolers, she also seemed dreamy. Huh? She was a very strong woman, and she was a bit older than us, so everyone looked up to her from afar. You looked up to her? That day, I just got so nervous, and without thinking... Why in the world did I act like that? All I had to do was say thank you. You know, the reason I started paper cutting... Look here. Is this... It's Reiko. There was something about her that made me think maybe there's a world she can see that we can't. As I look out on the world through the holes in the paper, I feel like perhaps I can see something too. Perhaps a simple wrong turn caused Reiko to give up on involving herself with others, humans and spirits alike. But there are people who still remember Reiko. At the edge of the small ripple Sasada talked about, I'm also standing. What's that? Huh? Oh, I thought I saw it recently. A bird soaring across the sky. For some reason, I found myself thinking that it was Mukuo. It feels like he's always been by my side. But I'm fine now. The reason he was always smiling must've been that he wanted to show that face to Yorie. It seemed as if Yorie's grief landed softly. I asked Kitamoto to contact Yuuki for me, and we decided to meet. It kind of bothered me. We ended on an awkward note. Me too, Natsume. I'm sorry. I can't actually see ghosts or demons at all. Yeah. I did get a bit angry at your lies, but I was happy. Natsume... I transferred schools a lot, would sometimes say weird things, and was unable to make friends. But you spoke to me. You tried to get to know me, even if it meant telling lies. It made me happy. I see. You don't have to tell me if you can actually see them or not. But if there really is something only you can see, I wish I could've seen the same things you do. Yuuki... I'm sorry for what I did back then. And... thank you. You get angry over lies, but then you smile happily. I just don't understand you humans. There are still a lot of things I don't understand either, Master. So right now I just want to learn more about both humans and spirits. Well, have fun with that. It'll just be for the short while until I take the Book of Friends off your hands. I'll see where fate takes you.
