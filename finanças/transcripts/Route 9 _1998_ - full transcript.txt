Especially if he was half dead, especially if he's of the criminal persuasion. How would you know that he was a federal officer with a wife and a kid? You gentlemen look like you're about to lose your lunch. [laughs] Why don't you get to the point, Jesse? Come on, boys, we're friends, right? And friends don't squeal on friends. That certainly isn't what Jesse Segundo is all about. Then what the hell are you all about, Jesse? I covered for you Earl. For both of you. I put my ass on the line to save yours so don't you pull a hostile tone with me. What are you proposing, Jess? I just want my fair share. Fourteen-five. Fifteen. One million, five hundred thousand. Sweet mother, we're millionaires. I'll settle for the third of that. And if we refuse? Tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor. Well now that's true, Earl. But neither is murdering a federal agent and stealing a million five. In fact, I'd say that's considerably worse, wouldn't you, Earl? Alright, alright. We'll play it your way, Jess. Under one condition. I'm all ears. We're gonna wait until this whole thing dies down. No, I don't think that's such a good idea. That's the way we're gonna play it. Now if you don't like that then forget it. Hey, I'm easy. Okay, I'll wait. But I'm gonna need an advance to oil the wheels so to speak. Well how much? I don't think $2000's gonna raise any eyebrows, do you? $2000? By Friday. The fuck do you think you're going? I'm not going anywhere, Frank, until you give me the tape. Whoa, George. If it's not Derek stabbing me in the back, then it's you confessing on your knees. So Frank, trust me. You're gonna turn state seven up against us, aren't you? My god! State seven's, holy shit! Hey, hun. Where's that uh, hot pad? What? That uh, that therapeutic back thing. I can't hear a word you're saying. Give me the gun. Come on. Time is getting back! George. Don't do this. Please, George. Michael, I mean it. George. George! [gunshot] [groans] What the hell is this? What are you digging around in my closet for? I was looking for the heating pad. You mind telling me where in the hell this came from? Is there something going on here that I don't know about? What do you mean? I mean are you spending my money on things I don't know about? Like you got any furs in there or something? Don't be ridiculous. It wasn't so expensive. It was supposed to be a surprise. Yeah, well I don't like surprises. Not when I'm the one footing the bill. You're about as romantic as a bag of sand. I could've killed that son of a bitch. Alright, enough. I'm tired of thinking about it. Well I'm not. He thinks he's got us by the balls. Well, he does. Besides, if that DEA lady had heard that tape, we'd be in jail right now. Let's just call it the cost of doing business and be done with it. This whole thing is screwed up anyway. I know what we gotta do. We gotta get that tape. How do you figure we do that? He's probably made copies. Well we'll get those, too. Booth, he's gonna be trouble. We gotta straighten Jesse out. Like it or not, he's a partner now. Have you been back here? -No. -Earl. I just took a little out. I'm keeping track of it, you can trust me! Damnit, was I talking to a wall? We had a deal. For crying out loud, Booth, I just needed to pay off a few debts is all. Now you got my word on it. I'm not coming back here until the whole thing cools down, I promise. That's what you said last time. Yeah, but... this time I mean it. [indistinct chatter] He found the lingerie. What? I told him about as a surprise. I don't think he suspects anything, but now you know if he mentions it. How the hell did he find it? He started thinking digging through my closet, something he never does. [sighs] Great. It's okay, Booth. It's no big deal. Let's hope so. If he asks me again, I'm just gonna tell him I returned it all. Damn, I hate this so much. I know. I can't stand him sleeping next to you slobbering all over you. He doesn't slobber, he just snores. I told you, we haven't done anything in over a year. It doesn't matter. He's next to you. I'm getting out of here, Sally. Hey. Something for you. Dwayne just needs that signature. Sally. Anthony. There you go. That's a nice dress. We're leaving. This weekend. Things aren't set. Yeah, they are. How? Well I can't tell you all the details, but you're just gonna have to trust me, okay? Okay. Sally, I love you so much. I'm gonna take such good care of you.

I've got bigger plans now. Well this is so sweet. You're such a good son. Aw, thanks, mom. You know, even when you were a boy, you never kept anything for yourself. Let's hook this sucker up. Well it's nice of you to join us. I did say 3 o'clock, didn't I? Well I'm here now. So um, what's up? I wanted to meet with you all to go over some new information about the shooting. Did you find a suspect? We've got some very good leads, Jesse. We found something very interesting about the tape that Denning was wearing. We contacted the manufacturer and based on the serial number, they determined that the tape was in a lot that was delivered and presumably sold... locally. Yeah, so? So... it's odd. Because I don't know how Denning had the time or the ability to buy something locally based on his situation. Well you'd know more about his situation than we would. Maybe. Maybe not. What are you getting at? Well unfortunately, Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say that someone got their hands on the tape and then they switched it. Well why would they do that? Because they didn't want anyone to hear what was on it obviously. [folk music] Well like you said, he's not here to tell us. That's true. That is true. Oh, you know, Jesse, I just received the second autopsy report back from Reno. You might wanna have a look at it. Oh? Well I don't mean to criticize your work. I realize that you mustn't get a lot murder cases up this way, do you? Well when we took possession of Agent Denning's body, I noticed that his lips were blueish. Possibly cyanotic. Oxygen starved. Now I realize that is not the cause of death, but I had them check for fiber traces anyway. Fiber traces? It seems that there were some fiber traces in Denning's lungs. It's probably not something that Jesse's equipped to find, but I thought he would find it interesting nonetheless. What does that mean? Oh, probably nothing.

I'm not gonna take it in stride. In fact, there's gonna be a change in our arrangement. What kind of a change? I want the rest of my share and I want it now. -Forget it. -I'm not asking. Well you're not getting either. You listen to me, Earl. I can give that tape to Agent Marks in a heartbeat. I turn in state's evidence, I get six months in a country club.

Not bad enough to kill him. Who said anything about that? We just gotta be a little inventive is all. I called central this morning. The bills appeared in the cash drop yesterday from a store south of here called Spice for Life. Did you talk to the owner? Yeah, and all four clerks. A lot of big bills go through there so no one know for sure who passed it. Any prints? Nothing usable. So Denning marked this, huh? Some of them. He only handled a small portion of the total, but this was one of his bills. I'll inform the office. Great. So you know about this all along? Yeah, well you can understand why we didn't say anything if word got out that there was a track on the money. It'd just work against us. Sheriff Hogan, it's not-- Dwayne. Dwayne, it is imperative that we keep this confidential. Now we know someone's out there. They're very close. More money is bound to show. And it seems to be staying fairly local. Fine. None of this information leaves this room. I'm not gonna say anything. That's good. We almost have all that we need. So what's this Spice for Life? Some kind of herbal, organic, nature food joint, or what? No, not exactly. It's a lingerie store outside Reno. Lingerie. Yeah, you know, camisoles, merry widows, tap pants, edible thongs.
