Shouldn't you be playing on a better league. - Never got a chance, did I? - We used to go to a few games, myself. - You did? - Yeah, me uncle took me. Don't forget, I am Irish. - What's that gotta do with it? - Didn't I see the World Cup. - You didn't win, did ya? - Ah, it's not our fault we're playing the bleedin' Sahara Desert. Anyway, England did brilliantly. - So why did he come to Sheffield? - Well, after me dad died, me mom wanted to be closer to her brothers, so we moved here about four years ago. - So you speak Irish? - A little bit, yeah. - Go on then, do a bit.

Give it here, give it! - All right. - Nice. - I know it's nice. - Is it for Annie? She'll love it. - Now that you're playing for Allen, you can shag any bird you want. - Hey now Jimmy, that'd be a mistake. You start giving girls a present, any man. - Is he? - Why? - All I'm saying is you don't want to, you don't want to get under their thumb, do ya? - He's a big mouthed git. - Like you? (laughs) - Can you hear me? Can you hear me in the back? I can hear you, shut up! I'd like to welcome you all to this Friends of Saddam Hussein hot pot Chopra. You seem to be listening. - [Man] Get on with it! - Right now... (men chattering) (man belches) That's better.

Has recently been pitched by Allen's football club, so Jimmy, if you'd like to come this way. - Go on then. (men clapping and cheering) (men singing) - Shut up!

But we're all proud of you going to Hallam. Jimmy Muir! (men clapping and cheering) - Thank you very much, appreciate it. (upbeat pop music) - Don't forget us, Muir, all right. - Hey, that was great that, Jimmy. - [Man] Give us that, let's get it filled. - Go on tubo. - Congratulations. - Annie. I didn't know you were coming. - I'd never miss this.

I got a date with another bloke. - Aye? - Annie, they need you in office. - No, I'm just kiddin' Jimmy, I'll see you at my house at eight, all right! - All right. Is that my tea? - She's a right lass, that Annie, better not lose her Jimmy. - I know. - Wouldn't mind giving that Mabel one. - Ask her out. - Think I should? - Yeah, why not? (laughs) - You gonna drink all of that? - Yeah. Want some? - No, I'm good, give to miss this time. Ken said you're playing really well. - Yeah, I'm all right. - He says it'd be worth taking seriously. - What are you on about? - Well, you never know, you might make a few quid out of it. - Tell you what, it doesn't take much to make me happy. (sweet instrumental music) Got something for you. - Ah, it's beautiful Jimmy. (Jimmy whispers) (sweeping instrumental music) (men cheering) - Yes! (men cheering) - Muir, want a word with you outside when you're finished dressing. (men yelling) Get on with it, get on with it. (all singing) Another brilliant performance there tonight, laddie. - Cheers, Ken. - We're only four points behind Fleshfield now. - I know, it'll be nice to catch 'em, wouldn't it. - I wouldn't know. He were there tonight, you know. - Who? - Tony Curry. - Tony Curry? - Wants to give you a trial. - Me? - Yeah. - When? - Saturday, 11 o'clock. - What, this Saturday? - Yeah. - Fuckin' hell. - You all right? - Aye. - Well, just be there laddie. - Thanks for setting me up with a trial, Ken. - Come on Jack. Curry asked for Jim, I don't set them up. That's just the way it is. - Right. - Excuse me. - You're not good enough to play for United. - You gonna let me pass or what Jack? - Why don't you make me, aye, you fucking wanker. - Look come on, Jack. Just let me fucking pass! - Come on, make me! Make me! - Don't be fucking stupid! (thuds) You're not fucking worth it, you know that. - Jimmy, have you seen me program? - Which one? - You know, the one. - I don't know what you're on about, Russ. - Yeah, you do, Sheffield United, 1904. - I don't know, Russ, I'm sure it's there somewhere. Russ, Russ. Can I tell you something? - What? - I've got a trial for Sheffield United. - What? You pullin' me plonker! I don't believe you! When's it for? - I don't know. - What are you on about? - I don't know. Don't know if I'm going yet. - I have an idea. You can flip for it. No, serious, flip for it. - All right. - Remember, tails never fails. - Have it your way, Russ. Tails I go, heads I don't bleedin' bother. - You're going. - Wait a bit, pal. Best of three. - You said tails you go! - Tails I go, best of three, that's what I said. - That's bollocks. - Oh, bleedin' hell. It's a right joke, Russ. - Who cares, Jimmy! You gonna have a trial with United, United! You can always say that. - I don't know. (slow instrumental music) - Jimmy, can I tell you something? A few year ago, in the mines, they take these ponies, right, and they put 'em to work pullin' up carts of coal in the mine all day long. Year after year, they live down there and they never saw the light of day. After a while, they'd go blind. When the pit ponies couldn't work anymore, they put them out to pasture. But only for a few days. Then they'd sell them for slaughter. - Why are you telling me this? - 'Cause this is your chance. You can make something of yourself, Jimmy. - All right. - No, you keep it for good luck. - Listen Russ, about this trial, you don't tell nobody, right. - I'd never tell anyone, Jimmy. United! - So, when's your trial with United? When's it for, champ? - This Saturday. - Well, good luck. - What are you on about? - You got no chance, that's what. If I were you, I'd stay with brewery. - Well, you're not me, are you. - [Joe] You talk to me five years, see where you are then, aye. - You know how to give people a boost, don't ya. All bets says you never even seen me play. - Oh, Jimmy's a great player. - Oh, you're a great judge, are ya? - Don't let him rattle you, Jimmy. - I'm just tellin' it how it is, that's all! - Why don't you just shut your big mouth, for once. - Who the hell do you think you're talking to! - Stop it Joe! - Aye? - Just forget it, mother, all right. - Saw a flat yesterday. - A flat? - Yeah, thought you might want to look at it with me. - What do you mean? - I don't know, I thought we could share one till I go to London. - What, share a flat? - I don't know, why not? (horn blows) Norm will have bill a cue for me. Listen, see you later. - Aye? - Tada! - Jimmy, it's your trial tomorrow. You want to make it quiet night. - Yeah, all right, see ya. - See ya! - See ya! (slow instrumental music) (men chattering) - Can I help you pal? - I've a trial like. - A trial? Better get this kit on, get changed. (men chattering) (men yelling) - Not bad. - Aye, he's not much of a team player, but he's fast. (men chattering) - So, what did he think? - Not bad, you're a clever player, Jimmy but he thinks you play like you're on your own out there. - I knew it anyway. - You knew what? - A stupid idea. - Oh no, Tony wants to sign ya. He just wants George McCabe to have a look at you first. You're halfway there, laddie. You've got another trial. - When? - Next Saturday. - Listen Ken, can I get you a drink or what? - Aye, I don't want to be a pain the ass, but you ought to watch that, you know. Fucking first division then. (soft instrumental music) - All right Jimmy thank you. - Cheers. - Jimmy. - All right Russ. - What's with you pal? - Our little lass has been crying all morning. - What's he done now? - He went into her purse and took 25 quid that were for gas bill. - Fucking wanker. - Then, then she told Mary that he ain't paid any bills for the last three months. He owes 300 quid, plus more to blokes he's borrowed from. - Where is he now? - I don't know, he's probably in bleedin' bookies, init he? - Hey, come on. (dog barks) - I'll have him put down if he don't start behaving himself. Not a man's dog. - No. - Nothing here. - Hello Jimmy. - Hey there lads, how you doing? - Great. You seen our old man? - Nah, sorry. Saw him this morning at work. He asked me to put a bet on for him. - How much for? - 25 quid. - Have you put it in already? - No, just picking one out for meself. - We'll put it on for him. See him later, anyway. - Here's 20, five. - What's he want it on? - Tomorrow's Fancy, little 10 favorite. - Thanks Fred. - What are you gonna do? - Give us a tenner, Russ. - Are you barmey, what for? - Come on, just hand it over. 50 to meself. - [Man] And they're off. Flying Color down the rails and Joker Motel the first to show with Tomorrow's Fancy. Nicely tucked in behind the outside and No Chance to be caught. They come to the first, it's Flying Color and Joker Motel, a mistake there by Joker Motel and Flying Color jumps in to a clear lead. No Chance in Tomorrow's Fancy over safely. And they run out into the country, Tomorrow's Fancy hugging the rails. They come to the-- Oh, and another mistake my Joker Motel and he almost brought down Flying Color. Now No Chance is taking it up Tomorrow's Fancy. They're running on neck and neck. They come to the next in plain fence and they take it again. Two great! - Come on there, come on, come on then! Come on Fancy, come on, you can do it! Come on! - [Man] No Chance to rank outside. Stride for stride, there's nought between them as they come to the last. They're neck and neck. Jump by No Chance, a bit of a stumble there by Tomorrow's Fancy. No Chance opens up a four link lead. But Tomorrow's Fancy not beaten yet, No Chance is tied. Tomorrow's Fancy gain with every stride, come into the land there's no daylight and they cross the line, only the camera will be able to separate them. So it's a photo finish between Tomorrow's Fancy, three to one favorite and No Chance, at 20 to one. And the winner at Wetherby is No Chance at 20 to one by a nose. Thicken in Tomorrow's Fancy. - Tomorrow fucking bloody Fancy's shite. (laughs) Get off you fucking nutter. What are you doing? - Think I'm daft? I put it on No Chance! (laughs) You put 25 quid on a 20 to one long shot called No Chance? - No, I put 50 on it! - 50, 50 fucking quid, you daft dick. - Other ones have to worry about, so! Come on! - Talk to me lads. - Oh no, not again. - Oh, well it were close, photo finish. - Were it? - Hey Fred, can you lend us a tenner till payday? - No, I bloody can't. Ask one of your lads. - No Chance. - You bastards. He'll be all right. - What's all that? - No Chance, our Jimmy just won a thousand fucking quid on him. - Here's your 25 quid. - Don't get cheeky with me boy. - [Jimmy] Come on Russ. - Hey, can't lend us a tenner till payday, can ya? - Not on your nellie, mate. (dog barks) - There was fresh speculation today that Prince Charles and Princess Diana will soon divorce. - Poor Di. Oh, it just breaks my heart, bless her. - Me and her's got a lot in common. - Well, that's men for you. - Turn box off mom, we've got something to tell you. - Chin up idiot. - Do you mind, we're just in the middle of this. - I know, bleedin' hell! - Hey, do you mind not fucking swearing in front of me mother. - Bollocks. - Listen, do you want to listen or what? - 25 quid our old man took out your purse. - Where did you get that? - Our Jimmy just won it on horses, didn't he! - How much? - A thousand smackers. And guess the name of the horse, No Chance! (laughs) And there's 300 quid there to cover the bills. - I thought I'd be pushing it for daisies before I saw money like that. - Come Russ, let's get a pint. - Ah, a few pints. - Jimmy, just be careful you don't turn out like your dad. - Bleedin' hell, mother. - See ya. - See ya. - See mom, he's nought like me dad. - Well, all I know is next time around, I'm coming back as a man. - Not many. (rock music) - I'll have seven large whiskeys please. (cheering) - You feeling all right? - What's the matter with you? It's our Russ's round next - Hey, I'll get seven pints, but you're not gonna show up with you, if that's what you think. - Oh, I'm only kidding. - You must be raking it in at the brewery then. - You must be joking. Now with Norman the foreman. Never ain't know with him there. - Get down mine, make my money that way. - You see Jimmy as a miner? No clear down there, mate. - All right, lads, all right lads.

So what's going on? - I've got something to tell you, Jimmy. Well, it's nothing really, I just thought if you want to have a look at a flat with me. - That's it. - What do you mean, that's it? - So you're not going to London? - I'm not sure now. - Look, can we talk about this tomorrow. - Do you at least want to look at the flat with me? - Yeah, okay. - What? Trying to get back with your mates? - Well, they're waiting for me like, aren't they? - All right Jimmy. - See you at work then.

You're gonna be here for the rest of your life, so get used to it lad and start showing some respect! - Shall I tell you something. You sound just like me old man. - You bastard!

Making an early night of it. - Oh aye, want to be fresh for your big trial. (phone rings) - I'll get it. Hello. - Well, he's not exactly a Tony Curry, is he? - Maybe he could be if you gave him the chance. Who were that love? - It were Mack, the gov, it's his birthday do tonight. - What, Macks birthday, and you stayin' in? - You're going Russ? - Oh aye. I'll tell him you couldn't make it. - I can't believe you're staying in on your best mate's birthday! Some best mate you are! Bloody rubbish.
