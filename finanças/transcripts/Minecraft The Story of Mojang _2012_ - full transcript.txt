And here we are in Minecraft, on a deserted island. There's a few things we need to do in order to survive the night. 'Cause what's going to happen is that sun is going to rise, and then it's going to fall. And when it falls, that's when darkness descends on us, and that's when the bad things come out of the dark at night and hunt me down and try to eat me. When did I first hear about Minecraft? Where was I when JFK was assassinated, basically, kind of thing? My awareness of Minecraft did not come from a magazine cover. It's like you hear it a couple times in the hallway, and it's like, "What? What was that? " It accelerated so quickly, obviously, that it's hard to recall that starting point, because after that, obviously, it caught like wild fire. It's a very unique success story, really. In the past, you know, five to ten years, there's been some brilliant moments in gaming, and Minecraft is definitely one of them. Happy New Year. Everything's, sort of, happening at once. You have this very clear, like, starting point. Yeah, I know, I took like a week off during the Christmas and New Year's, and it was just, like, almost emotional, like, kind of weird, like, "Oh, okay, all this has happened and I haven't really relaxed until now. " And then when I came back, the office felt really good; and just; the first thing I did was work, like, 12 hours. Let's just start with growing up in Sweden; what area of the country were you originally from? Well, the first seven years of my life I lived out in the countryside in a place called Edsybn. It's like, a bit north in the country; very snowy winters. At least, that's how I remember; and really warm summers. We went out, walked around in the woods, just getting lost, basically. And I did that and programming, basically my two hobbies. No, I've been programming since I was eight, or something. I kinda always knew that I wanted to make games, and I said so in school to my, like... ... Career Counselor thing, and she said, "Oh, well, that's probably not gonna happen. " Yeah. That's what he likes to do, you know; but he always made games, you know; I always found it interesting to try out his games. And I was like, "Yeah, you're a genius! " I like hanging out at his place, and he would like, "do-do-do-do-do, " you know, be on the computer, and I like hearing that sound. So, but, it's very much like an artist, because he has so much integrity in his work. Markus and I, we've been friends for the four and a half years that we worked together at King. And we became close, and we had a lot of fun, and then of course he had the success, 'cause he left King to start-- basically he wanted to do games in his free time. And while we were working with King, we were allowed to make games in our spare time, but we couldn't do it as a business; and he wanted to try that. I was sad, of course, that he left, because we had a great time at King. You know, I lost my best buddy, my best working buddy; but I wasn't worried for him, and we stayed in touch regardless. So I left to make my own games, and the first thing I was gonna do was just gonna be, like a, six to twelve month project; and it kinda turned into what Minecraft is now, fairly soon. But in the beginning, it was, I mean; it was so basic, you can place blocks on other boxes or blocks. So yeah, I got to be there and look at it from the start. Of course in the beginning, the world was more limited; you had the edges; you would fall off. I don't think anybody could predict the success of Minecraft from looking at it back then. I really liked the game from the start; it's like a digital Lego, you know? You have blocks, you can build things, and people are like, "Oh, this isn't so fun. " You know, it's hard to explain; I usually say, "Okay, but it's about surviving, as well; you have monsters you have to fight, you have to build your house and collect stuff to be able to survive. " So it's a bit like being stuck at a desert island, like, figure out what to do. Let's go to a place where everything is made of blocks... ... where the only limit is your imagination. Let's go wherever you wanna go; climb the tallest mountains, venture down to the darkest caves, build anything you want, day or night, rain or shine; 'cause this is the most significant sandbox you'll ever set foot in. Yeah, I usually tell people, "Well, you have to try play it; you won't understand. " To be honest, I really didn't understand the power of the game in the beginning. I think at the point where Markus took me aside at the office and said, "I really need to focus on this" and he told me about the success, and you know, what kind of numbers he had. Then I realized that this is gonna be something big. At first it was 40 sales for a day, then it was like, 10,000 sales a day, you know? I don't remember the date, but when I had a million Swedish Crowns in the account... ... was, definitely one of the bigger milestones.... And I got a print-out of the receipt, showed Elin, joking, and jokingly said, "Well, they say the first million is the most difficult, " like I didn't expect to make another million. I did. You know, it's been like this process of constantly being amazed. Then like, early this year, it got a big popularity spike on the site; but I probably need to start a company here, 'cause I can't keep up with the demand of the game. I called Jacob and just told him, "Just quit your job; we're starting a company. " With the success of Minecraft, we get the chance to actually do something like this. I'm not gonna turn that down. So now we're seven people and we have an office. It's a new year, and it's finally beta. It's a very unique success story, really. The problem is is that Minecraft never had a publicity department, a PR department. They just did it all virally and through word of mouth. And, you know, it sold three million copies off that. If you are not familiar with this game, this game is amazing. I love this game so much, I've been watching a ton of videos on YouTube. I've been playing a ton of this game. There's something really magical about when it first came out, and nobody knew much about it, and we're all learning at the same time. Have you seen this crazy thing? Look at this, look what you can do with here; and people talking about it, and I could not comprehend what they were talking about. I was like, "You did what in this game? This is insane. I can't imagine it functions like you say it does. " Let's talk Minecraft; you've probably seen it popping up everywhere lately. If you have not played it yet though, we're about to school you, because it's one of the best gaming experiences out there right now. I remember loading it up for the first time, and nothing; you're just standing there with two hands. And so I hit a tree and wood came out; and I was like, "Oh no. " Like, I could already see the spiral; it was like, I hit this tree and wood came out. And then I, you know, hit the ground and rock comes out. I was like, "Oh no, this is gonna be bad. " , "... ? " And then it's that first night that you spend holed up; all you can dig out is like, maybe four squares before it gets dark, and you just pile blocks up as the zombies running around outside. That moment, like, I won't ever forget that. That is a moment in video gaming that will always be with me. And to me, that was what sparked my interest in the game. Like, holy cow, this is-- I can do whatever I want here. And so that's the first part of this game; which is, you know, exploring and collecting resources. People saw the potential in it, and if you had the opportunity to play it at a friend's, or you saw a video on YouTube, for example, I think the game pretty much sold itself. This is my house here, as you can see. All you do is you put it in the center here, like this, and then set a fire to it. And not always, but most-- uh-oh. Uh, sorry, sorry guys; this is not supposed to happen. Crap! Oh, no way! Yeah; you have got to be kidding me. You know, a lot of people that saw those videos? were instantly in love with the game too, just by watching someone else play. Okay, it is time I go exploring; where should I go? I'm going to climb to the top of this, and I am going to see what is up there. I'm joining Stu, and we're in the Minecraft multi-player; we're exploring the cave here. Uh, whoa! Jesus, that scared the crap out of me! Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God! Pull this switch here and the flood starts. Plop, plop, plop, plop goes the wheat; plop, plop, plop, plop, plop, plop, plop... ... moves its way down here till it gets to the very end, drops into my collection tray.... Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit! Holy shit bro! Dude you're so laggy! I blame it on lag; damn it! You guys get--take cover! They're firing arrows at us. Ahh, diamond, yes, oh! Oh my God, there's more; yes! Oh my God, seven diamond from one. What's wrong? Ahh, what's that thing? It's a skeleton; I'll kill it for you. I killed it, yay! -No, no, no, no! -What's wrong? -You're jumping into lava! -What do you mean? You're being so bad at Minecraft! You're in lava. -Oh, man! -You're dying. That's horrible. I died. That's okay, Mom. That's okay. And you know, this game had a really special community around it. And I think that's a fascinating story that before the magazines and the TV shows were covering it, there was a whole community that was loving this game and supporting it, and it was really self-sufficient at that point. So that could have existed, sort of, in its own little bubble, but then the world found out about Minecraft. -All right, what are you? -Creeper. A creeper? What's a creeper? A creeper is something that blows up when you touch him! Is that what you are? -Okay, you want to take us in? -Sure. This is our fancy sign; here we go, welcome. As you can see, it's looking really awful right now; we're going to remake a lot of things. Yeah, I can show you around; and here we are in the office space. We have a PC section and a Mac section. We were thinking about having, sort of, a Minecraft wallpaper here. So this is Jacob; he's one of the co-founders of Mojang. Over there we have Jeb; he's a game developer. He's sort of the first person to dive into the Minecraft code. And so over here we have Daniel Kaplan; he's the business developer. Exactly; and here he is, Notch. I'm sort of showing them around the office, and you're Notch. -I am Notch. -He's the reason why we're all here. -Yes, I am God. -Yes, that's right. -I am not God. -Did I say I'm God on camera? -Yes, I think you did. I heard that Notch was starting up a company. I played and heard about Minecraft before, obviously, but I didn't know that he wanted to take it to the next level. So I just sent him an e-mail, "Hey do you wanna--do you need an artist? " Got a reply, we met up, and kinda hit it off, I think, immediately; started joking about prostituting ourselves to elder women and stuff like that. So that's it, really. And now I'm here. It's also fun to be a part of this so early, and really be with the core team. I don't know how big we are going to be in the future, but it's fun to be here from almost the beginning. Well, I started here two days ago, on Monday. I went in, signed the contract, and started working. -Welcome to Mojang. -Thank you. -Great; you've worked here for-- -I've worked here for four hours now, so. I've had--got 600 followers on Twitter since Monday; I had a thread on Reddit discussing me. It's just an awesome place to be right now, because it's like... ... I catch myself walking down the street, or just thinking it; you know, there's not a job out there that I would rather have, that I would trade in for this. I hope he doesn't miss and hit the other guy. Punch his pal in the face and they're all gonna fall and die. -Oh, you're going to hit it from the other side now? -Yup, here we go... whoa! It feels really good, and it's very interesting, what's going to happen. We're going to have, like a, strategy meeting day thing, trying to work out what we're actually going to do. Let's do that again; can we do that again? -Wow. -That's awfully bouncy. We have to decide what actually, like, the full version of the game is. That's kind of the first step, I guess. Then the next step is to do that. Minecraft's a very dynamic game, and it's 'cause it's still in development at the moment. That means that it's continually being updated with new stuff, and things are changing. Back in like the '80s and the '90s when you would get a game on PC, or much more often, when you got a game on console, when you got the game, that was it; game was done, game wasn't gonna change; and we've seen that change bit by bit. And certainly it's happened more on PC where people can patch and update games, but I think none of that prepared anybody for how malleable and evolving Minecraft was gonna be; I mean, to the point that you could buy the game, ultimately, more than a year before it was actually going to be finished, and play the game as the creators were updating the game. And then slowly but surely, it kind of, you know, built attention and anticipation about where it was gonna go. So this is just like, the major headline; some things we should add now. Yeah, I think it's a bit like-- it's a weird way of making a game. You just put it out and kind of keep working on it as you're making it, so it's kind of hard to say is it released, or it's not released? I try to make sure it's like, yeah, this is not the game. I'm just working on it and you can play it while I'm making it. Kind of, hopefully. Should we go up with the dates, or should we just say this will be released when it's done? Or should we like, try to put up a date and try to build hype? I think date and hype; I vote for that. I think there's a difference between this and many other games in that Minecraft has so many... ... so many users and so many players already; and as we develop these things, we're gonna--we're not gonna develop in, like, in a lump and just put them all overnight and say, "Okay, play this game, and now it's done. " It's gonna come, you know-- every other week or so it's gonna be small update or a small change, so can we really live up to a hype, you know? This is finally the finished product, and I said, "Yeah, but it's the same product as last week. " What do you think of that? It is--it's a bit intimidating, yeah. I felt much more, just confident, just going day to day and just doing things as it went. I don't think that works though, if you have a company. I'm a bit like--I don't really know what Minecraft final will be yet, but I think we kind of got some kind of rough estimate, I think. -The new roadmap. -Yes. We probably missed a bunch of things, but I think this is a good basis. -Oh, there they are. -They want to film us eating the muffins. Since we sort of missed it, could you just explain what happened with the IGF today? Yeah, they announced the IGF finalists, and Minecraft got in three categories: it was the main prize, technical excellence, and design. So the main one, the grand one, technical, and design; which is really cool. You know, Markus, when he e-mailed me, he said, you know, "I'm hoping to win some Independent Game Awards. " And he didn't really know what all these awards were, but it was sort of a big trip to America; really to, you know, meet the press, and meet the industry for the first time. And yeah, I think everyone then was starting to realize that Minecraft wasn't some fluke, it wasn't, you know, something that was kind of coming and going. It was building, and it was growing; and that's what was great about it. It's this virus that was starting to spread. -Hey, nice heads. -Thank you; I have to say, it's an honor to meet you. -Yeah, thank you. -Hi. -We're from high school. -We just came here to meet everyone and see-- -Oh, cool, hi. -It's so amazing to meet you. -We all play Minecraft. -Hi, it's an honor to meet you. -You too. -Man, you inspire us. -Oh, cool, awesome. -I gotta shake your hand one more time. -Oh, of course. -Notch. -Hi. -Pleasure to meet you; my name is John. -Hi John. -I was wondering if you could sign this for me? -Absolutely. -My name is Marie. -I'm Markus. It's amazing, and, I spend so much hours on it, I can't believe I'm meeting you. -Oh, cool. -It's so fantastic, but um--congratulations. Well, thank you. -Hello. -Hi. Hello, how are you? And it's fascinating to me to see that happen, and you know, see someone like him show up at GDC, not knowing what to expect, and then just have this constant deluge of people coming up to him, saying, "I love the game. " You know, that's when I think it probably really hit him, that, you know, Minecraft had grown... ... into something that people weren't just playing; it was something that people were loving. -Should we go on? -Yeah, yeah. Going back to what we talked earlier about... I told you that my daughter likes Minecraft. I met Shigeru Miyamoto 2 years ago. I said, "I'm going to meet the creator of Mario. " She's like, "Yeah, whatever. " Now I told her I was going to meet you... And she's like, "Oh~" How many new friends have you made since you became successful? How many relatives that come out of the woodwork? How many lost cousins? I probably shouldn't answer that. So I only really just met you, but you seem exceptionally cheerful, a cheerful man. You just seem a happy man, and I'm wondering if that is because of your success. Are you always kind of quite chippy and--? -Jacob has known me for a long time. -No, he's a total drag. No he's not.. Yeah, I hope so, I try to feel so, but I still have this kind of weird feeling that I don't really belong, and I think it's called, actually, "The Imposter Syndrome. " It's like an actual term for it, if you're like, you're just faking it. And I think it's gone too fast or something, so I don't really feel like-- But yeah, I'm slowly trying to realize that people actually do like the game; which is kind of a weird thing to say, but when you're just sitting in front of your computer... ... and you just see the numbers, it's not the same thing as actually meeting the people. Do you feel like you'll need to do a couple more games to really feel confident in your own ability? Yeah, I think so. It's kind of weird; when I kind of grew up, famous people, to me, like John Carmack and stuff, were not really like, actual people. They were like forces of nature, almost, that just did awesome things. And now people tell me, like-- not everyone, but some people say, like, "Yeah, you're the Carmack of this generation. " And to me, that's-- there's no way that can be true, 'cause that guy is... ... well, obviously, very talented in what he does; and I just made a game. And I kind of realize that on the surface it sounds like the same thing-- he made a game, I made a game-- but it doesn't really feel like it's the same thing. I kind of feel that all the time, with the success of Minecraft; it's kind of hard to fully understand it, even to this day. I mean, we're starting to see it because we get so much feedback and so many questions from big companies, and people want to do business with and stuff, so we're starting to grasp that. I'm constantly thinking that maybe this is just a really fragile thing; that we have this attention now, but we have no idea where we're gonna be in one year. I mean, on one hand, it would be kinda cool to have this kind of run, and then kinda slide into obscurity again. I'll be like, nobody, and just do my own thing again. I think everyone feels a bit like that, more or less, and maybe some people don't even know how to express that feeling. But, you know, he's very, you know, aware of his own feelings. So I think it's just that he knows how to express that, because I can recognize that from, you know, when he started a new job, or, you know, people say you're good and this or that, and he's like, "Oh, they don't know, you know? " And really, just, you know, been lucky, or this or that, you know? I think that's just human. Everybody, welcome to an all-new Bonus Round. I'm Geoff Keighley, this week, at the Game Developers Conference, and this time, we're gonna look at the independent game scene. There've been some amazing indie games have come out over the past few years. We've got an all-star panel to tell us about what's going on in the independent games movement. Although Minecraft, you're a bit of a rock star right now, Markus, with the success of Minecraft, and all your fans out there. How do you look at the indie movement, 'cause you've really sort of entered the scene here, you know, in the past year in a big way, with Minecraft. How do you define indie? Yeah, for me, I think indie is-- well, there's a lack of a label for it; it's kind of a concept of people making games for the sake of making games, or exploring games as an art form, perhaps. I think a lot of the large studios make games to make money, or make games to make a sequel, or to make a brand; but to make games just for the sake of making a game. Coming from that angle, I think that's kind of the definition of "indie" for me. We're gonna get a little philosophical, because in my opinion, games have the potential to be, what I call, the preeminent art form of the 21st century, sort of in the way that film was in some sense the preeminent art form of the 20th century. I figure we're about where film was in 1905; whereas you think about it, in 1896, they first filmed Fred Ott sneezing, and like, "Oh my gosh, it's a guy sneezing, I can play it back! " But it was a long time between then and "Birth of a Nation" in 1915 or 1917, where it's kind of the first quote-unquote, modern film, where, you know, hey, they didn't realize early on that you could film a movie in a different sequence than you showed it; like the concept of editing; they had to figure that out. They couldn't move the--they didn't know you could move the camera, all of these things. And so I feel like we're really, really early in games, but I think they have the potential. I mean, the way people interact with art entertainment, whether it's music, or film, or literature, any of these things, is primarily at an emotional level. The emotions that we support as games is basically power fantasy right now; whereas if I asked you to like, you know, make a game about two people falling in love, you'd be like... ... I have no idea how-- there's no way to approach that problem; we just don't have any idea. And I think you see this in Minecraft, which is like-- the thing everybody mentions is the huge component of it, but then the game play that everyone talks about is just surviving the first night. Like, that's the magical thing that people talk about, and that is a very human-scale thing. You're not saving the world; you're just trying not to die. -It's very official. -Oh yeah. -Ready. -All right, thanks guys. -Yeah, it was good. -Awesome. -What about you guys? -Yeah, it was good, thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the Game Developers Choice Awards will begin in a few minutes. We ask that you please take your seats. Video games... ... video game award shows. Which came first? In the early days of the games industry, it really felt different than it did now. Mostly it felt isolated, 'cause the Internet was not around; so you just knew the people at your company, and if you're, you know, lucky, you made friends at the Game Developers Conference; it was like the only time during the year you'd see other people who had the same problems as you, or, you know, were in the same boat as you were. So it was a lot more--kind of like islands, like people making games... ... were on their own island making their game, and then you put it out there... ... and you'd wait for a magazine review to come in, and that was your feedback, you know?... But now it's like everything is so instant. You put a game--you can put an unfinished game up on the Internet, for example. But that would be crazy; who would do that? -Best Downloadable Game goes to Minecraft. -Thank you. And the Innovation Award goes to Minecraft. And the Choice Awards for the Best Debut Game goes to Minecraft. Yeah, GDC, I didn't expect us to win in anything; I didn't dare, even hoping, that there was just-- well, I kind of had this, "I hope at least, something, or I'm gonna cry. " Then we won like, five awards, which was way beyond what I even dared hoping. We started figuring it out when we got to the center front table, something big was gonna happen, but I still didn't dare counting on it; but then we won just a bunch of awards, and it was just ecstatic, and we didn't know what to do. It's still, like, the biggest night of my life. Please join me in honoring Creative Director of Microsoft Game Studios Europe, and co-founder of both Bullfrog Productions and Lionhead Studios, Peter Molyneux. I never believed, never in my wildest dreams did I believe... ... that I would be standing out here and getting a Lifetime Achievement Award. The very moment I first saw Minecraft, the very second I first saw it, it was like a-- it was like, you know, the world changed for me a little bit. What I did immediately; I went 'round to everyone and said, "Oh, you gotta go and play Minecraft; you've got to look at this game. " And a lot people, a lot of my colleagues, you know, Lionhead and Microsoft, they looked at it, and-- some people looked at it and said, "This is ridiculous. Where's the tutorial, where's the challenges, where's the--? " You know, there's this list of game must-haves; and Minecraft broke every single one of those formulas. You know, it is like--it is, in a way, a social Lego, when Lego used to be a creative toy; which I don't think it is so much anymore, because it's much more prescriptive. It's really interesting how Lego at the moment is like traditional games design: it's buy the box, open the box, turn to the instruction sheet, make the model, stick it on the shelf, buy the next box. That's exactly like traditional game design, you know: buy the game, go through the challenges, finish the challenges, stick it on the shelf, buy the next game; where Lego used to be just a big box of bricks, and you used to take the bricks, pour them on the carpet, and then make stuff; and that's exactly what Minecraft is. There was no instruction booklet; but that's really what this points to, is just how conventional game studios, how complacent they were with the games that they were making. And we need, this industry desperately needs things like Minecraft to come along and say, slap us 'round the face and say, "Hang on a second. All those things... " ... that you thought were absolutely certain in your life? They're not certain anymore. Definitely grown; I think we all are. I mean, it's an experience that I think very few people will ever experience, you know. There are few companies in the world that have experienced this kind of growth. It's very inspiring. So we're kind of trying to figure out exactly what we're gonna do with the company now. Okay, so, we've discussed this before-- I think as soon as-- I sometimes find it hard to concentrate. I don't think we have the grand master plan of world domination; this seems fun now, let's go for it. And I think that's great. If I would have been Markus, I would have, you know, doing blow off hookers' asses; that's what I've been telling people. But seeing how he still remains so humble and grounded in reality, that's extremely reassuring for someone like me, you know? I'm very pleased. Good. -Oh, hello Notch. -Hello. We had a great party on Thursday, celebrating two million. Do you want to sum it up? I was just gonna ask if it was good, 'cause I don't remember it. Oh, okay, yeah. Anyone else? Cocaine's one helluva drug. I'm really envious of the new crop of game-makers out there, like Markus and other people, who are just doing it themselves; like all by themselves, with maybe with one or two people on their team; 'cause they keep the cost down, they can self-publish, and they've just made so much more money. That's the secret; when you take someone else's money to make your game, you have to give them all your money after you're done. Not that I'm bitter. I think we all want to stay small, and we want to stay in control, and we want to stop the world looking in; it's very, very, very, very hard to do so. I mean, I think the perfect size for me is once you reach over 20 people, that's when it gets really tough; because then you need to have... ... another layer of people to manage the people that are there.... And when you can all fit in one office, and you can stick your head up and say, "Oh, what's that you're working on? " or, "Look at this everybody" , that's a perfect size. But once you get over that, it's really tough. So if I was doing it all again, I would say exactly what Markus is saying; I would say, "I'm gonna stay small. " I don't want, like, a big office with like, 150 people; it kind of turns into a 9-5 job. I would say I'm afraid of doing what Id Software did, but I'm not gonna say that, Id Software ? 'cause that's rude against Id Software. But I mean, their games aren't as fun as they used to be. I mean, they look better. I mean, the MegaTexture stuff is really amazing, but I'd rather play a fun game. And I want us to make fun games, not just big production games. Ideally for me, it would just be like, me and a box of Red Bull. I'm gonna play dark ritual, get some--two cultists. And someone could, like, discard-- you could discard this. Yeah, I will next time, yeah. -What's the next big event coming up, E3? -Yeah; We have the E3, which is basically, not for indie game developers at all; it's just about spending money, and launching titles. I have to go, apparently. I mean, it's a cool trip and I really like going to the E3, but I kinda want to code. Oh cool! That's why I-- that's why I recognize you. I was like, do I know him? I think I know you, what's happening? To ensure we can accommodate everyone's carry-on baggage, please place smaller items under the seat in front of you... ... and larger items in the overhead bins above your row.... Yeah, we started the podcast in 2010, in October, 2010. This is maybe about a month after we actually started playing the game. So in a month's time, we knew it was something special enough... ... that we wanted to devote our lives to talking about, and to producing a show.... So we did know it was going to be something big and something special. And I forgot what you asked already. This is for people who don't know; this is where what we've been doing... ... over the past week since the last episode.... But I've also been watching my son play Minecraft, which has been fascinating, because-- Like the Shaft podcast guys, for example, I'm like, "Wow, this is more than an hour just about Minecraft. " It still blows my mind; it's like, wow, they're actually just talking about this game. It's amazing.. So this is from Nergock who said, "I have to thank you guys for suggesting... ... listening to a book while playing Minecraft. It's greatly improved my Minecraft enjoyment... " And we try to be on time, never skip one; except we missed one episode... ... because tornadoes ripped up our city; but that was the one we missed.... And honestly, when that happened, the community got together, and, awesome girls, too, Tory Love pulled all this information from the community and basically-- it was an appreciation show for us, that she gathered all this material so we didn't have to do anything. I mean, I'm getting chills just thinking about it right now; it's just an amazing community around the show and around this game. Community is always going to be, probably, the most important thing when it comes to Minecraft... ... because that's what makes it bigger than itself. It's very cool to see, you know, people are so involved and really, like, making something that's just about this game. I do think that there is something to be said for the fact that so many people are excited about the game, and they are excited to share their excitement with other people. And I do think there's a synergy from that. I've never seen anything like this. It is--it has so much universal appeal over so many different kinds of people; I've never seen anything like it. I mean, Minecraft, because it's such an open experience, an open world, kind of naturally lends itself to be populated by these sub-cultures... ... of mission and creators, or podcasters, or live-streamers. Yeah, Yogscast is certainly one of them, I think. We met because we both were in the same World of Warcraft guild. So we met in a thoroughly nerdy way and ended up doing a thoroughly nerdy job, which is, effectively, playing Minecraft. -That's our job, isn't it? -Well, it's not just--video production, and--- but basically we do get paid to play Minecraft. -Dude, there's something up there in that cave. -Is there? Yeah, it's a green thing, look, bouncing. -Oh, Christ almighty, it's a creeper. -It's gone. -Yeah, those are very, very bad. -It's gone, Simon. They follow you and they explode; don't go in towards it; it'll see you. We don't script anything; we just play the game and record it and put it on YouTube. So, a lot of people watch it. Good morning! So we hit a million subscribers this morning. I'm gonna go and wake Simon up with one of these. Morning Simon, I've got you a coffee. You all right? But it doesn't pay, you know, super well; you only get sort of, nought point nought, nought, nought one cent per, you know, view. But because we have a million views on a video, that actually ends up adding up to enough. So it is a big audience of people, and I think we probably do it a bit better than most, which is why we're just-- But we're still modest. It's kind of like a journey for me, playing Minecraft and watching... ... how it's changed over the months and months, and thinking in a few months' time how different is it gonna be? And I guess it is kind of nice to have almost feel like you're a part of that, because you've experienced that as a gamer. And since you're in debug mode; you can just change the code and it just instantly changes, which is very, very efficient. Yeah, I can do anything; we can make arrows explode when they hit the ground instead. Arrow in ground; there we go. When doing a game, it's more about what to expect from a game... ... and trying to play around with those expectations; that's kind of the most fun part. Let's give it a bigger explosion! There we go. Oh, is that thunder? -I think it's about 9,000. -9,000? Or something; it's insane. Minecon is basically a celebration of the launch of Minecraft. Do you think it's reasonable time to do it in November? Yeah, we can-- It would be cool to sort of do a live deployment on stage when they deploy the one dot o version. That would be cool. Yeah, I will get nervous. We haven't put up the site where people can register yet, so we have no idea how many are gonna show up, and we signed the papers already with the hotel. I mean, at least a couple of hundred should show up, I think, but I have no idea. It is a collaborative medium; developers and gamers collaborate. We are makers, we are creators, and that's why we're here today; because we're gonna celebrate that collaboration between developers and gamers. So I'm very, very grateful for everyone who's come to join us today, and I think it is particularly fitting that our first presenter today is Mojang; because it's hard to imagine a game that would, like Minecraft, that would flourish, because it breaks so many conventions and basically hands the creative keys over to the gamers. And that is truly revolutionary. And so I am very, very pleased to introduce Markus "Notch" Persson and Lydia Winters, who are gonna show you the Minecraft Adventure update. Please welcome them. Minecraft is why we do what we do, because it-- you are literally looking into the future when you see Minecraft, you know? Like I said, we've always had these genres, we always had the traditional stuff, but this is the future of gaming, you know? This collaboration, this emphasis on creativity, on freedom. And it's thrilling to be able to be here and say, "Yes, I was there when it happened. " He obviously knew he was creating building blocks; but I don't think anybody could have expected... ... how ready so many millions of people were to take those building blocks and say, "Okay, I'm gonna create stuff in the game. " I don't think anybody could see that coming. Sorry, that was really horrible. -Oh, its okay. -Its a good thing I left... ... because you would have been very alarmed...... ... that I was gonna die.... The fact in God games you kind of own the world... ... isnt as important as owning your own house.... And that idea of building, and creating, and almost moding, as part of the gaming experience, is why its far better than a God game, and a game that I've done. Sure.. Youre, uh-- No, for sure. Its fact.. Because of Minecraft, I think, it has changed... ... my view of what I do on a day to day basis. I still really believe that I have got one great game. You know, inside one great game idea that I can inspire a team... ... to turn into a real idea in me.... Well, everyone in the studio is huge, huge fans... ... of Minecraft.... Oh cool! It is amazing when you do something like that, and then it becomes this expression of everybodys creativity. It is such a cool place to build, and grow a community, and meet friends. I wouldnt even call Minecraft a game anymore. Its so much further than that. Its a platform. Its a platform for us to develop our architectural side, our creative nature. It lets us be ourselves, communicate with people, and create things that we maybe didnt think... ... we ever could, but now we can.... Anytime I get on that server, I get astounded by the imagination, the creativity of the people that are on there, and my jaw just hits the ground. I just cant believe what the people; A, have the design sense to accomplish. I cant do it. I dont know if its just me, but Im looking at this stuff, and like, Wow! And Ill tell them. Ill say, This is fabulous. This is fantastic. How do you do this? Hi there, everybody! This is Halkun, and Im gonna demonstrate... to you how I really dont play Minecraft like other people. Now, first thing youre gonna notice is Im kinda staring at a corner... of a very, very deep well. And its made out of bedrock, and its very, very high, and Im sure youre probably thinking, Why Halkun, that is a very, very deep well. And Im gonna show you the reason why. It is currently holding... ... this!... This is a 1:1 scale model of the Starship Enterprise. I just got finished putting the framework together. I havent slept yet, so Im gonna be a little loopy... ... as I show you what I've got here.... So, as you can see theres still some scaffolding still up there. So, why dont we take a walk, shall we? I reversed 6502 code for fun. So, I have like disassembled source code... ... from Final Fantasy I. I have disassembled source code... ... from ProDOS for the Apple II that I've taken apart. And thats what I do, I find these programs, and take them apart. I've been, I've been reverse engineering applicate software... ... for like ten years. Im actually active in a community... ... where we've been disassembling Final Fantasy VII...... for the last decade. Pretty much Im all over the map when it comes... ... to just things.... Intellectual property law, I do reverse engineering, I do the marketing. So, its because I live in a very tiny apartment, and Im often bored. Um, let me see if I can find my Enterprise. So were sitting at... 8,984,531, and I need to update these badly. What are some of the comments here that you have? Nerd! I need a girlfriend! What a geek! The Virgin Diaries, because evidently... ... Im a virgin, too.. Uh, I dont think you guys have never really appreciated... ... how absolutely huge the Enterprise is, but I dont know, this is kind of a shock to you. This thing is fucking enormous. People who dont play Minecraft just looked at this, and go, What on earth did that nerd do? And a lot of people, when they saw this too, they saw the video, and they never-- They didnt know when Minecraft was getting all trendy, and everyones like, I dont wanna play. It sounds like everyones just getting on the band wagon. And I remember when someone saw my video, and they posted underneath it, Okay, I get it. I understand now. Now I see why this is such a game that-- why everyones playing this game. Before when you would go on YouTube, and you saw somebody who modeled the Enterprise, youd think, Wow, thats incredible. I could never do that, I dont have the knowledge, of the modeling software. Like I cant do that. But when you see Minecraft, the Minecraft Enterprise, youre like, You couldnt. Lets be clear. Like you could never do that. But theres a part of you that thinks, If I just had the time... Its sort of democratized, right? Because everybody has the same pieces. And in this youre making it out of something. And theres a being in there that is doing it. Right? So, its much easier, I think, to map yourself to that. This is Voyager. Theres the Enterprise E. There is the Klingon Bird-of-Prey. So, we can make these ships, take these blocks, and put them in this world where we can build our ships... ... with these blocks, and then, you know, wire them up, give them life, and see what happens. But if you have something take it, and try going in a completely different direction. Take the seeds of it, and then see what else you can do. I dont wanna see bigger and better, I wanna see this way or that way. Hey guys, I just want to show you a project... ... I've been working on in Minecraft.... Its up here. At least a good view of it is. This is a Arithmetic-Logic Unit. And an ALU is found in every processor because it does math. When the Minecraft Enterprise came out, the computer came out at about that same time. It is 16-bit, and somewhat slow, and big, and unwieldy, but its implemented in the video game what do you want? I have it set up, hopefully, so that when I add registers, and ram, probably not very much ram, and program counter, it will be a legit computer. Okay, so this is the ALU of a basic computer. So, this is the output. These are the inputs. And these are the controls. Im gonna do 2+1. Its gonna be crazy. Im gonna turn that on so it adds it, and we look over here, theres a huge bus... ... taking all the values from the end of the ALU, all the way back over here. So, bit wise I mean, we added 2+1, we get three, which is one, one... It can only add, really, but multiplication... is just adding over and over again. division is subtracting over and over again, and subtraction is just adding a negative number. If pieced together, they can do any operation that a regular computer can do. Okay, this has four bytes of memory. I would say in Minecraft you could probably build... ...512 bytes of ram.... Which 256 bytes is the amount that was in an Atari 2600. So, that kinda gives you a feel. So, you could probably double that. So, heres the entire computer. Here you can see. You can see the connections, you can see the cross over. You get a very visceral way to appreciate whats going on... ... inside these things that we cant see anymore. Theres not just a disconnect between regular people, even programmers, just usually taking on faith... ... that they click a button, and now all this stuff they wrote... ... can be run. That this disconnect can even translates into people... ... who are suppose to know whats going on... ... is really interesting. but theres definitely this class of machines we have now... ... that are tantamount to magic, and we just see them go, and watch them do... ... all these amazing things, and nod, and say, Okay, this is where we are right now. And know that the chain of us moving from the present... ... to the future..... And now theres gonna be even cooler things. And thats just kind of where it stops, and you dont say, Okay, how does this work? What are we really doing? I hope you guys check in later... ... to see this once I have a few other... ... finished chunks done. Thanks for watching. Infrastructure is such a key part of Minecrafts success, I think. Because its a game about sharing, so you just need that infrastructure in place to share... ... either your creations, or your things... ... that youve engineered in game... ... like a color printer I saw somebody made last week. To share those ideas, right? Those ideas need places to move around. Without YouTube, without Twitter, message boards, community sites, it wouldnt have been as successful, for sure. So, Im gonna now show you some pictures of some... ... of the cooler things we found, and people have built... ... in Minecraft. Whoa, the Eiffel Tower! What? That is so cool! How did they do that? Okay, thats-- Okay, that is a lot of work. That looks pretty cool. I would, like, never thought of that. Ooh, a castle! Is that Hogwart's? It is! Im smart! No, youre a nerd! Its self-perpetuating in that way of because people create things, and they spend time creating things. They wanna share those things. So, automatically more people, and new people are hearing... ... about that game in a contextual way. Theyre not watching an ad, theyre saying, Hey, I made this. You can do this too! Do you wanna play? I found out through, was it Tyco's post... ... on Penny Arcade? Im not sure, but I heard about it there, and my best friend was like, Hey, its a game where all you do... ... is mine and craft.... And I was like, Really now? I definitely wanted to spread the word too, like. Yeah, there was an evangelical, sort of. It was at the very beginning of the-- -The big, like-- -The take off of the game, right? -Yeah. -So there wasnt a lot... of material out there about what it was like... ... to actually play it.... Like this game will suck you in, and you are in trouble. And then you introduced your son to it, and every time I would go over to your house, he was playing it the entire time. Yeah, still is. Hours. Every night, hours. Hot. I pictured him sorta getting in there, and not knowing what to do. It turns out that wasnt an issue. So, wheres youre, uh, dont you have... ... a train station in here somewhere? Oh wow, thats cool. I saw the one that-- they had a bunch of music blocks, and it played the song from Portal. Hes my boy. I love you son. What? -What? -Oh nothing. You know, its interesting, because especially as a parent, you think, Boy, I really need to limit-- You just hear you have to limit his time-- You have to limit their time in video games. You dont really know why, and I think thats... ... I think thats just ridiculous now, because you know, what is a video game anymore? When hes been playing for a couple of hours, and I come in, and Im like, Alright, Gabe, I think you need to take a break. And I look, and hes built a functioning aqueduct. Thats no joke. Like he figured out how to get water... ... from one place to another by building this contrap--... Its like Im not gonna tell you to stop. You know? Parenting has changed. We have, uh, these nice people. Theyre from a real film company... ... making a real movie about Minecraft.... And theyre just gonna be watching what we do. Were gonna be doing what we normally do. Were gonna be playing Minecraft. Im gonna be-- have activities for you. You guys are gonna get to do your own things. But really just, were gonna be ourselves today. Kyle, yes. I have always been a gamer. I still remember the day my cousin brought over... ... a Pong machine, and that was sort of... ... like a life-changing moment, and I kinda grew up... ... with computer games in my life. Right now, Im teaching our Lower School Technology classes. So, Im mostly working with first and second grade, and Im a big believer that in bringing games into the classroom. I think it gets the kids really excited about being here, being in school, being in my class. Do you like school? Sometimes. Well, what's your favorite-- do you like the Minecraft stuff? Yeah, computer is my favorite subject. Kids are excited about games. This is where they live. You know, they go home, they play games, thats what theyre excited to talk about with their friends. Its this generation. You have a computer, or a Wii? Yeah, we have a Wii, an XBOX, A PS3. My older brother has a PlayStation. And they're talking about doing well in a class, and leveling up. I mean this is where they live. This is kind of where their mental head space is. And when I started playing Minecraft this past summer, I just, you know, there was just such... ... amazing amounts of potential that I really knew...... ... that I had to try to make it work, and find a way to bring this into my classroom. Im gonna break you guys into groups. And each group is gonna make their own house... ... out of these different materials.... Max is off and running making some tools. Guys, Ill make doors for us. -In the desert. -Oh, I see it. You got it. You guys like the game? Yeah. It is really, really fun. Like, its kinda like a free world. Its not like New York City with all the traffic, and all, I love it. Im able to dream up these different worlds, and different adventures that the kids can have... ... that I think theyre gonna get something out of.... That theyre gonna have-- thats gonna have... ... some lasting value for them.... Well, Minecraft is basically another version of your life, except its a magical version. Lots of great team work today. And I had a lot of positive feedback. You know, our network administrator told me really early on... ... this is one of the coolest things I've ever seen done...... ... in all the years of working in schools.... Then the teachers who are not gamers, yeah, I mean, I guess they would kind of... ... scratch their heads, and theyd say thats nice, Joel.... You know, Im glad youre doing something fun with the kids. But, once I would get them in the room for five minutes, once they would see just how excited, and how engaged the kids were, you know, almost everyone of these teachers... ... would walk out of the room a believer...... ... that I was really on to something here.... Not sure I fully understand it. Im not sure I understand it at all, to be honest with you. When I first saw this game, I thought, Wow, this is really pixelly, and this reminds me... ... of my Atari 800 days.... And I couldnt believe that the kids were satisfied with the graphics. But they dont even seem to notice that part of it. Do you like playing Minecraft? Its awesome! Its so much fun. Thats the only part I dont like. Listening to everyone talk about it all the time. The kids come in, and you literally... ... have to rip their hands off of the keyboard. You don't like listening to everyone talk about it all the time? Its annoying. And I love to talk about it. You two still manage to get along... even though he talks about Minecraft all the time? -No. -Yeah. But lets remember theres things they can do... ... in Minecraft that they cant do in the real world. I mean, I cant drop a bunch of kids in a forest, and tell them to build a shelter in real life. And even if its not quite real life, theyre thinking, Well, what would I do... ... in this situation?... What must it be like to build a castle on top... ... of the mountain, and try to fortify it.... What must it be like to explore a jungle. What must it be like to farm, and raise crops. I mean, these are things they can do in the game. And then if a teacher is able to spend a little time customizing it, setting up these scenarios, the potential is limitless. Well, with the teaching, were gonna go talk to... ... the Minecraft teacher in New York.... Okay.. And well see him teaching classes, and things like that. I mean is that something you ever expected... ... would come with the game?... No.. I think his nickname is Notch. Oh yeah, Notch. Nacho, youre a great man! Notch. Notch. I think the person would be very smart... ... to make Minecraft.... I think he likes adventures. I actually look forward to 15 years from now... ... when these kids-- well, not my age necessarily, Im a bit older than that, but when theyre grown up, and to have a conversation with someone... ... its like, What, you worked on Minecraft? Well not really, but I sat next to the guy who did. Because I've-- just like youre saying, some of the games, you played when you were young, just, they stick with you. And its gonna be that over Minecraft as well. Its gonna be awesome to hear that in 15, 20 years talking to people. And its also gonna be very fun to see what Minecraft means... ... at that point, so. Im very much looking forward to that. Its gonna be interesting, because theyre gonna... ... be looking back on it nostalgically...... in like ten years from now. Ah, thats a scary thought. Yeah, that means, That means we really need to do it right. We have so much to do, and not much time... ... until the release date.... And I was kind of joking that the release date... ... that were told is not really a release date, its like, well, its more like an aim. But Carl didnt agree. He said, Its going to be released that day regardless. My attempt to push it a little failed. Hey. What's up, sir? How's it going? Good. Carl, you look like a rock star, man. Geez. I don't feel like one. It's going good. I'm a bit stressed out. Definite--the pressure is increasing in the team. I would say I need to finish this, so I'm really focused on it, so right now it doesn't feel like we'll ever work on something new, but I have all these ideas that I want to try. And I've actually like spoken to Jens and he would be willing to take over... ... like the head of Minecraft and he's really good at it. So, I feel comfortable that he's someone who could do a very good job at it, but right now it feels like I'm gonna keep working on Minecraft forever. We'll see. I'm very excited about it being done because it's like a milestone, I think, that would be really worth celebrating. Like, "Yeah, now you've made it, this game, now it's finished. " So, yeah, I don't think it's sad like that. I mean, maybe, you know, I don't know how long this game will live and be popular, but maybe when it fades, then you would feel a bit sad like, "Oh, yeah" , I'd be nostalgic. You know like, "Oh, I remember when it was so popular" , you know. But, no, it definitely doesn't feel like that. I think it will keep gaining, so. Oh yeah, another bug, the bow doesn't get damaged when you use it. We're just taking today as a final, like, polish day. We have a few reported crash bugs that we can't reproduce, so it's like, we would like to fix them, but we don't know how. Yeah. I'm a bit nervous because, mostly because there are gonna be, hopefully reviews, and those are gonna give the game like a score and they're gonna say, "No, this game is five percent less good than the Super Mario Galaxy" or something. Like here's a bug. "Redstone torch randomly burn out and never recover. " Okay, where do I start? I have no idea, so. Oh, so fun this is. Oh, there we go. Now that's right, correct. Oh, damn it. I'll mark this as can't reproduce. So you said you just sent the game off? Yeah, I put it on the USB sticks and then I sent the final like zip file to Tobias, so he can make the upload script. Now it's 20 minutes past 3 and I have one-and-a-half days to go... ... and then we go to Minecon.... So I figured I'd play with Legos. It's a bit weird 'cause I still feel like I probably should still be polishing stuff 'cause there's stuff to polish, but I don't want to risk getting new bugs, so we're not doing that. And I'm super nervous about the flight, not nervous, more like giddy or something, like I can't wait until the flight goes. See you guys tomorrow. Yup, see you then. So, I think he feels that, okay I can't do anything more now, it's done and I'm going to Vegas. So, I think that's why he's giddy and, uh, and I started to feel that as well, so probably tomorrow. I'm gonna lock down the Scrolls version tomorrow morning... ... and then I'm gonna just kick back and put my feet up and play some...... ... Virtua Tennis 4 and go out and have a beer with Markus, and you know, just cool down before the trip to Vegas. It took a whole truck. It's very cool. I mean, there's been talk about 5,000 people. I don't think there's gonna be that many, but who knows. Yes. It doesn't work at all. But, uh, we only have a few more minutes left, so we really do want to thank all of y'all for coming here, and this has been the highlight for us of this past year... ... and what Minecraft has done for all of us.... Because Minecon is finally released, it's the end times. No one thought it would ever happen. It's Minecon--sorry, it's Minecraft. That's okay. I'm getting all of your games wrong. I've played it a few times. I heard you did, yeah. Yeah. He's still learning. Yeah. I guess just to close out, I think you're obviously idolized... ... by a lot of, uh--I'm sure that must make you feel...... ... kind of weird at times, but you're obviously idolized...... ... by a lot of indie developers and people that want to make games.... You know, they look at what you've done as a kind of success story, you know, like you went from being a guy making an indie game... ... to a guy that can have 5,000 people come out to a convention to see him.... So, do you have any words of advice to people out there that are, you know, trying to become, you know, an indie developer? I think that the best advice I can give everyone is, "Don't listen to advice" , but if you are going to listen to advice, then making sure you actually do something is good advice. If you just sit around planning something and not doing it, you're not actually gonna get anywhere. Cool, yeah, I think that's a good.. -Yeah, cool. -Are we good? -Yup. -Great. Awesome. I'm actually not doing anything myself, but maybe I fall on the stairs or something. Music please for entry. This is how it's gonna look--what it's gonna look like when people are entering. So they'll be the music on, the lights will be low like this. That's impressive. -He's like a magician. -That's so Las Vegas. Everything's gonna get dark for the HAT Films video. It's kind of like how I said how I feel the game deserves a six or a seven. I do realize it's probably going to get higher scores than that, but I don't really dare hope for that 'cause to me it's a-- There's so much more that could be done to the game. It's not really finished yet and I don't think it's ever going to be. Yeah, it sounds like the closing ceremony started. Yeah. Well, would you like to hear him talk? Yeah! Okay, so, Notch, how does this feel to you right now? No pressure, yeah. It's very overwhelming. I mean, the reason I started working on Minecraft and kept working on it... ... was because of people playing it and it's the reason we started a company...... ... because there were fans, and now we have like 5,000 people here just for...... ... the game, for Minecraft, and that's......5,000 We are so thankful that you guys traveled from all over, literally, the world. We have people from all different countries here celebrating with us... ... to be part of the official release and we are so grateful...... ... and absolutely humbled that you would come all this way...... ... for this game that this team has been working on, but now, for the moment that you have all been waiting for. Yeah, 2011 was probably the weirdest year of my life. It's a--feels like a blur now that I think back on it. So much happened and so I can't even describe it. The weirdest year of my life. It's really hard, this summing up things. You know, it's--'cause there's so much that has happened... ... and at the same time trying to work and then of course manage the family back home.... And we had some illness in the family as well, we're trying to balance that and it's just, it was almost too much in one year... ... I have to say. Let me show you around. Watch out. Let's see. Yeah, right as we enter, this is where, sort of, everyone will sit and work. A bar will be over there. Next to it will be a pool table. Actually, we'll have the logo on that wall too. The logo, okay. Yeah, and the logo on that wall. Cool. Over here is the Marcus' and Jacobs' room. They'll have their own sound-proof room. Pretty good. Yeah, it's gonna be great. It's really hard to, really get your head around... ... everything and summarize, but, you know, obviously it's been the most amazing year of my life. Just going from, you know, sitting in a shitty apartment, you know, working on things that I hate and you know, absolutely seeing no future for myself aside... ... from the few fleeting moments of glory that I had, you know, posting some pixel art online, you know, going from that to actually, you know, this, travelling around the world meeting fans and stuff like that, it's been a pretty wild ride. A lot of things happened last year. We recently changed Minecraft's front page, so it has my Twitter account instead of Notch's, so... one difference. So yeah, slightly before Minecraft I asked Jens to take over... ... as the new game developer, the lead developer of Minecraft...... ... and I left the game and now Jens is doing it. We, we sat down and made a plan in the beginning... ... of last year and that is still, we still use the same plan...... ... because we only got half ways through that list.... I mean, I think we should be able to do this in half a year, which means we won't, but at least that's kind of a base "guesstimate. " I barely talk to him at all about Minecraft. Sometimes I ask him small things, but he said he didn't want... ... to interfere and he has definitely not.... Well it's a relief and kind of a curse 'cause I won't ever be able to top that. It's a bit of a relief not to work on something that big... ... because I think I've done a lot of soul searching that... ... that I'd rather work on something smaller like-- 'Cause I made Minecraft kind of for myself... ... and that's the kind of games I want to make, but now there are so many like kids playing it and parents playing it... ... and I can't really understand that audience.... So, it feels like there's a huge responsibility to keep like... ... your child safe and make sure the parents can actually use it...... ... the way they want to use it with their kids and stuff.... So, I'd rather actually work on something where I kind of understand the audience more. So, after Minecraft came out, the launch was a huge success, and then he handed the development off to one of his colleagues. I began to hear whispers of, "Oh, he's just counting his money now" , or, "He's not really that into making games anymore. " And this struck me as strange because it didn't really seem to fit... ... with the guy I had met a couple of times and interact with over email or what have you, and he seemed to me like somebody who's like, he loved doing this kind of thing. And it was, it was comforting and it was exciting to find out that those whispers were wrong... ... when his next game, which I'm still not even sure how to pronounce, was announced... ... and to find out very quickly thereafter that it is potentially as insane as...... ... Minecraft was conceptually.... Yeah, I kind of burnt out towards the end of Minecraft, just the pressure of releasing it and like I realized that I was gonna move on, and all that, and then I started getting really inspired to make games, started doing the space game and it feels like the beginning of Minecraft. It's kind of just--you don't really know what the game is gonna be. It's like--it's scary because it could be something completely different than what you thought... ... and might not be fun at all, it might be super fun.... So, it's very inspiring. I'm pretty sure Bethesda doesn't have a trademark called "Ten to the C. " Damn it, I pronounced it! Damn it! Damn it! I think I could put this up now if I wanted to, but it's not really fun yet. So, once it's kind of at the point where I can-- I would get lost for an hour instead of developing, then that's probably when I'm going to release it. I guess I'm kind of afraid of the fans being disappointed with the new game. I mean it's a space game, it's not like a fantasy, chopping game or whatever. What the first big chance of success and the chance of expectation is that when you're... ... the new kid on the block, no one has formed any expectations from you whatsoever, and then when you exceeded, way, exceeded people's expectations, asking someone to do that again is really tough. Usually what happens in a successful situation is that the person, you know, the sophomore slump kind of thing, or like blows it all. I mean, if this was music, they'd blow it on crack and hookers but, you know, I don't think-- And he's getting married and like he doesn't seem like that kind of guy, but at the same time, like stay focused on the thing that you're trying to do and don't worry about, what I call, weather, right, like when you just can't, you know, you can't control--it's gonna storm, it's not, you know, whatever, lightning's gonna strike, sometimes it doesn't. You know, do all the variables you can control and that's the quality of the game. I've often felt creatively, it's key to have a really bad memory and to forget what... ... you did last and really start off each project like it's your first one in a way, and I feel like the trick is to do that almost every time, just like go back to the beginning... ... and really treat each project like your first project and start from scratch again... ... and not worry too much about people are expecting or want from you, but go back to the same place that gave you your first idea, you know, you didn't get your... ... first idea by listening to some advice from a publisher or, you know, you just kind of, you followed what you love and cared about and followed what really inspired you and that's... ... where your idea came from and that's what you should do every time.... Great, sorry about the coughing.. No, it's fine. I'm sorry that, uh... I had a cold and then I talked too much and don't breathe enough and that's what happens. We should probably try to wrap up before we get stampeded. Okay. Okay, yeah, I think we'll have lots of time. I don't think so, I mean, I'll talk forever, so like-- You gotta start with something. I'd still like you to show us the game. You guys should play. All set? That's a clapper board is it? Yeah. Wow. Awesome. I wasn't even hot, like it didn't even-- Shut up. I'm burning up. I mean it's not like we were moving around or anything. I was packed between you two guys. Minecraft--wait, it's an M. Minecraft. Feel free to use that as your logo for your movie. Minecraft--what are you calling it anyway? What, the movie? Yeah. Minecraft. Where do you get your ideas?
