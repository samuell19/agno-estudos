Daddy, are you a parasite? Where did that come from? I heard Dimitris calling you a parasite. Parasite means… a cool guy. Laid back. Come here. - The lady! - Which lady? The same one on the poster you have on the wall! Yes indeed. The lady… Can we watch it? No. Let’s watch this one instead. Can we watch the one with the lady? No, we'll watch this one. Come on daddy, I want to watch the one with the lady! Here you are you ol' chap! Lift off! We are falling! What's going on? Aren't you ticklish? It doesn't tickle you here? Have you received your official redundancy paper? Great. Bring it along with your ID and... But you are all douchebags! You are all huge douchebags! Hey, calm down. What happened? Leave me alone, they cut off my unemployment benefit! What? All of it? - Sir, I think you should go. - Lay off dude! Fuck! The kid's alimony! For fuck's sake! Vaggelis Palis! Free Anarchist Vaggelis Palis! Don't touch me! Mary passed by… Said she fell in love and she's leaving for Brazil. She wants to sell the furniture. Said she will pass by one of these days. Anyways, the house is ours for the time being. Can you recall the last film she appeared in? Wow, is it memorabilia time? Memories are calling you to return... Depends on what you mean: Distributed before or after the incident? The Mystery Surrounding Laura Remember this one? Hi. Hello, my dispatcher says there is a problem with your plumbing. Ethereal. I'm not really sure what, but there's something wrong with the shower. Like a vision. That’s why they sent me. I’m an expert. The shower is this way. Oh, that’s my friend Sheri. She just came over to use the shower but – guess what? It is broken. Don’t you ever wonder what happened to her? Sometimes. Wasn't there a rumor that she left with a Saudi Arabian prince? Not a Saudi Arabian! With a Greek American Director of Photography who got her into voodoo and stuff. What? Voodoo? Great voice, huh? Playback for sure. I think it's her actual voice. No way. I'd bet on it. Really distinct tone. She would even be suitable for the band. All of us... Together. So why don't you stand up and change it? Why don't you? You're closer. I put the tape. I opened to the delivery boy. And I paid the delivery boy, what's it going be now? I need you. What's that? Did you put that in the video? No, I haven't put anything. Now. Now. Do we have any other tapes somewhere? I've brought a couple upstairs, check in my room. THORAX MRI SCAN Did you find anything? LUNG CANCER LUNG CANCER AND ONCOTHERMIA HYPERTHERMIA I will pass by “Tocopilla” at Koukaki. I wil also ask for you, in case they need an extra DJ. Christo. He is a cool guy. Grissino, the tall one, who owns it. You haven't played for some time now. Christo. Christo. What? What do you want? Good morning by the way. I think the time has come. Well, the wages are low, but he pays on the spot. And the booze is on him. I remember one time... Are you insane? Soon we won't even have money to eat! Where the hell are we supposed to find her? On the deep web. We can start from the deep web. Well I don't think so. Maybe you should go for a walk, clear your mind and stuff. Forget about it. You should drop by the tall guy's bar. That's the best you can do. And move your vinyl records from the van! They will rip them off! Freakin' rats with wings. I just wore that today… VERTIGO IS LOOKING FOR YOU A bird took a dump on me. A good sign. Yeah, I just bumped into the Building Manager. I didn't go into your room because you would start whining. Go online and start searching. The guys said it's ok to use the van. Did something happen? Nothing happened. We've been thinking about it for ages. Now the time has come. You already have an account? This guy has been busting my balls. What's going on? This jerk from outside Athens wants to buy my records. Whatever, let him take the sheep out to graze. Now, write something cause I'm in a hurry. ''Missing porn star wanted''. Fire it up Cosmo! MISSING PORN STAR WANTED Laura is an illusion. Laura is in front of your eyes. She is right next to me. We found our guy. J.F. Sebastian. He wants 400 euros though… Right, but we only have 200€ for the rest of the month dumbass. What would you do if you learned you might die soon? Maybe I would spend the last days with my son and the people I love. Are you the ones? About Laura? Yes. We are. The money? What exactly are you going to give us? Aren't you little small to know about Laura? Small in the sense that you are young. Do you want me to go on or not? Yeah, of course! Give me the money. What, you mean here? The money first. Then I will bring it to you. Half of it. 200 euros up front and the rest afterwards. Fair enough, don't you think? It's over there. He fooled us! Hey. Another message. Should I read it? Yes I will! I've got all the information you need on Laura Durand. I do not seek a reward. This is not a scam. Contact me via the email vertigo alpha vertigofilms dot com. Vertigo Films! Laura's production company! Yes. And what if this is another trick? What if it isn't? And it is called ''at'' not ''alpha''. Dumbass. That's him. What are we going to do? How about if we rob him and run away? Well, first let's have a beer with the guy… Ok. Who are you and what do you know about Laura? Antonis. And this is Christos. You can call me Vertigo. The commonly known Vertigo? It used to be my professional alias. Are you having something? It's on me. Oh, no-no. See, we don't drink alcohol. Two beers and two short glasses. And some peanuts if possible… Bring two beers and two short glasses. If I get it right, you seek information about Laura Durand. Correct? Sort of. You know, I was Laura's agent for about eight years. I met Laura in the late 80's in Budapest. When we met she had already been working in the industry. With forged documents of course. While being a minor? She was so fragile at the time… Just a child running away from home. And it is exactly that very innocence that stupefied both me and the audience. At some point in the middle of the 90's our production company faced financial problems and was eventually shut down. I was forced then to distribute some 8mm footage of our own careless moments. That cost her a lot. Cruel. Sick. I understand how you see it. The world of showbiz is very tough. It had already started getting on her nerves. All that fame had worn her out. She was even mobbed by fans everyday. In 1995 in New York, a man committed suicide by jumping off the 22nd floor. Holy crap! Are you serious? Don't you even remember that? After that, she tried to shift into a career as an actress. A proper actress. She recorded a single as a singer too. All in vain. Then she made her first suicide attempts. The situation was out of control. Soon Laura left me and, five months later, disappeared during a shooting in Trieste. Just before her last scene, she opened the door, said "excuse me" and left. Nobody saw her ever again. Haven't you heard anything about all that? Save me After her disappearance, I searched to find her. The findings by the police were insignificant, to say the least. As usually, they didn't have a clue about what happened. At some point they implied that she was in Greece. So I decided to find her on my own. I moved back to the country and made a map marking all the spots where she was last seen alive. Do you believe she is still here? All I know is I have tracked these clues. That is all. Hold on mister Vertigo. What do you want in return? Steve Gerekos-Disco “Ruins” Runaways to the Vertigo of Imagination Nothing at all my friends. Just the fact you are looking for her is enough for me. I owe Laura the most beautiful moments of my life. Just tell her I say hi. Where did you end up? Are you sure? This is quite rare! Power. Power! Get that thing out of my face! We sold my vinyl records for nothing. There are mobile phone applications for geographical coordinates, you know. Steve Gerekos-Disco “Ruins” Steve Gerekos… Steve Gerekos... Steve Gerekos! The Director of Photography, remember? An extreme person. So, are we going to eat something or what? Chill out man, you have eaten half the van! We are getting close… Disco Ruins. According to the calculations… It should be somewhere here on our right. DISCO WRECK (EX RUINS) That sums it up. Can I borrow your helmet? Excuse me, do you know who are the guys playing? He is Herman. The other are the Broods. Is there a problem? I heard he was dead. Yes he was. I don't see any sign of Steve around… Can we just leave? Don’t worry about it now! Groovy times for evermore! This gig is like when we saw the Wipers live in Budgieland, remember? Hi, do you know where is the toilet? Christo! Christo! Christo! Christo! Come with me right now! So what is going on this time? Come with me! Sometimes you reflect an antisocial behavior, are you aware of that? Wow, you brought a friend! Awesome! What is it now? What's the big deal? Sorry we didn’t sweep recently. This is a squat you know, you wusses. Are you staying here? Well, yes. Why? Do you know who might have put up this poster? This broad you mean? It must have been left over by the previous owner. The place used to be a renowned Disco! Remember the guy's name? Don't know. He was a weird guy. He rented this spot, made a name out of it, then suddenly abandoned it. Do you know where he might be now? Listen, are you cops or something? No sweetheart. We’re musicians. Yeah, right. Now why you turn us down like this sugar? Ok, sorry... The guy is running a camp down the beach with yoga and stuff. I don’t know much more and I don’t want to learn. Do you know where is it? A couple of miles from here. On the beach. There is a parth. What is a parth? Why am I always carrying everything? I got to take a leak! Now where the hell are we? Dude! Excuse me, do you know anyone named Steve Gerekos? Excuse us, we look for Steve Gerekos. Did you happen to see him? Come on champ. Say something. Eh… Steve. Gerekos. USA? Director of Photography? Give me a minute. So, how can I be helpful? We would like to have a chat with the owner of this place. The owner of this joint. There is no ownership here, brothers. We are against ownership. Our Brotherhood is based on the love for the sun and the light. We try to adjust our energy with the Sun using Yoga, meditation, Buddhism and love. And funk music. Our ultimate aim is the harmonic vibration of our solar plexus. Ok. Do you happen to know someone named Steve Gerekos? A Greek American Director of Photography? I'm really sorry, it seems I can't help you. But please stay for the night. We are having a grand ceremony for the solstice that is about to occur. Someone might even know this Stan you mentioned before… Steve. Yes. Steve. Thank you Chrysanthos! We’ll stay the night, since there is a party is going on! Chrysanthos is a really nice guy! Too bad he doesn't have a clue… - He's lying you know. - Yeah, yeah. What? Why does he keep a photometer in his cabin? To measure the light when they do the Jackie Chan? Feng shui is the proper… What's that in the cabin? - A photometer. - What's that? Accessory used by Directors of Photography to measure light. Old school type, made in USA. And now? Now they use these digital ones. They are ok. ...I was hoping for a time machine. And I found it here. And we are all united, we have all left our homes, we changed the way we lived, our names. My name is Sunbeam. How were you called before? Barbara… Go on. The man behind all this is Chrysanthos whom you met. He organized this community, set up this property, he is our big brother… Barbara… Have you got any idea what he was doing before? No, and I don't care. Some say he was in New Orleans, others... Why do you ask? Just asking. Do you have any rolling papers? I'm out. Is this your family? And who is she? Your girlfriend? Something like that. Laura? How about you? Do you have a boyfriend? No, not this period. Laura? Laura! Laura! Calm down. It's me. What are you doing over here? Whatever I want! Ha! You must have had a bad trip, right? You will recover. Go back and I will ask the girls to prepare some herb for you… No! You are Steve! We found the photopeter! – Photometer… - Excuse me? It's called a photometer, you idiot! I don’t think there’s a need calling me names. Alright? Laura! Laura does not exist. Is that understood? It’s all a big lie. An illusion. Oh really? And who is that girl over there? My Aunt? Laura! Listen, my patience is running out. Why don’t you find your house in that little map of yours and beat it? What did you say? The map? Laura! Brothers, what the fuck? Get him! Laura, my love, I'm coming to save you! Brothers, get him! Fast! It's a trap! - What? - A trap! Run! Hey, wait! Get them! Do us a favour, will you? - The keys are on! - Take it then, what are you waiting for? Get them! Why didn't you shout out for me to wait you? I was curious to find out how big of a douchebag you are! Come on! What's that? You nicked his photopeter? Photometer. And yes, why should I spare him? I mean, Black Magic, Voodoos, Chrysanthos, Sunbeam. Never trust a hippie! Is that going to guide us? We carry on East till we find "The Garden of Earthly Delights”. The what? "The Garden of Earthly Delights that have a high cost". There you go. You saw how it is done, now use it on your own! Ok, enough! Enough I said, you are going to destroy it! Is that supposed to be nice? Stop it. Can you spare me one? So do you think that the whole thing was in our head? What whole thing man, I don't get you. I mean Laura. She could be just pretending to be sweet and fragile. You know, so all her fans would fall for it. Do you think she really was an illusion? Like the voodoo guy said. Voodoo! No man, that was her alright. I am sure. How can you be so sure? Haven't you ever thought that this might be part of a marketing strategy? Music and interviews as long as you can stand it, this is the Marketing! I don’t know... No, I do know! I know that she is for real. How can you be so sure? Could her eyes be a lie? Could these eyes be a lie dude? I still remember when I saw her for the first time. True vertigo. I never felt this heaviness in my heart for another woman ever again. Am I a fucking poet or what? One thing is certain: If it wasn't for Laura, we two would have never met… Are you sure we’re going the right direction? For fuck’s sake, this can’t be happening! Fuckin' smartphones! It said so. Here. Latitude 39 and 22 and Longitude 22 and 66. Those are the map coordinates! Where is the damn house? Man, couldn’t you go better? Aren't you supposed to be the driver? Kept taking turns and shortcuts, instead of heading straight to the spot. Latitude-Longitude! Simple. It seems I have to do everything on my own. I’ll do the calculations with the sextant. Much better than waiting from someone else to do it... Watch where you leave it jerk, see what happened? That’s it! Enough! Hold on you motorhead, you are going to waste all the beers! As long as I can remember you fuck up and always blame the others! Antoni! Christo, Christo, Christo, Christo. Are you alright? I didn’t want it, I'm sorry! Christo! Wake up! Christo! You fucked me over you jerk. I'm sorry. We found it. We found it! Yes-yes. Here we are. The longitude was 39 and 23 instead of 39 and 22. Just 45 meters further away. You were about to kill me for a mere 45 meters decline. If you’d let me use the sextant, I would have found it in no time. What do we do now? Now… We knock. And say what? That fifteen years ago maybe here were the whereabouts of Laura Durand, a Greek-Hungarian porn star that we’re looking for? So we came to ask if she is still around. Have you got a better idea? Dude, maybe Laura is standing behind that door as we speak. Can you dig that? How can I help you? Εh... Do you happen to have some ice? We were injured. Nice house! It used to be my father’s house. Once it was almost captured by the communists, but we managed to save it. Good for you! Good for you Ms… Anni! My name is Virginia Anni. The gentlemen? He is Christos Fertakis. - Pleased to meet you. - Me too. And I am Antonis Titsanis. Any relation with the famous Greek composer? No, no. His name was Tsitsanis. My name is Titsanis. Titsanis! What a name! What do you do for a living? - Musicians. - Sound engineers. - We are… - Artists. What can you do, things are tough for young people like you nowadays. George - my husband – was a district attorney. It used to be a different time then… Has he retired? This way leads to the west side of our manor. This way please. Have a seat. The house used to be full of people, we held masquerade balls, parties. The place was full of life... Ah, the years have passed so quickly. Come on now. You look so young. Where are you actually heading? - We're on tour. - We’re looking for... a friend. - We are... - Artists. Yes, we already said that. You can stay for the night if you want. That’s not necessary Ms. Virginia. If you insist of course… I do insist! You will not go anywhere. Oh dear, I forgot to bring the ice! - Are you an idiot? - You are an idiot! We have to stay and search, see if there are any traces of Laura! Is everything alright boys? Yes Ms Virginia! Thank you so much. My favourite dishware! A masterpiece. Where are you going dumbass? Do you like it? The woman in the portrait? Is she a relative of yours? No, this is Jasmine. She was a housekeeper in this manor for many years. May she rest in peace. Oops, what was that Ms. Virginia? It might be an owl, there are many in the area… Is she dead? How much you’ve eaten, your faces have swollen! I haven't laughed like this in years. A fruit? And who helps you with the house nowadays Ms Virginia? I don't need help anymore. Since Lau… Jasmine. Yes, Jasmine. Since then I have left everything in the mercy of god. And why did Lau... I mean Jasmine leave? All men are pigs my boys. Ah... Jasmine. When she appeared in front of us, we were fascinated. She was a unique creature. We made her part of the family. And then? Ah, then everything started collapsing. Jasmine and myself developed a special relationship. George also started expressing his interest in a pressing manner. You understand… I didn’t mind at first, all men are allowed to be a little naughty from time to time. But then things got serious. My husband became obsessed with her and started searching for her past. And? Did he find anything? The girl had a troubled past. Based on this, George started blackmailing Laura in order to succumb to his every desire. And then you blame the communists. The girl had an irresistible charm Mr. Christos! And then, and then? When George came home one night he found us, how can I put it, in a very intimate moment… Things become more interesting. Things started breaking bad. Next morning, Jasmine... Laura decided to leave without a trace. And where did she go Ms Virginia? Nobody ever saw her again. After Laura left, George could not take it... One night he took the car while being drunk and drove into a lamppost on the road. Straight on!

If we keep this pace, we’ll definitely be there by the end of the year. Hello? It was Mary. She wants to sell the furniture. So just because that stupid cow fell in love she will strip down the house? That’s a cliché to die for! Who me? No, not you. Calm down mate. Oh, seriously? Calm down? You woke up one day and felt like Indiana Jones. And here we are in the middle of nowhere! Our bones are going to rot! Yeah, we saw you as well. You weren't too hard to convince you know. I just came for you, you wanker! The whole day you rot your brain in front of the computer. You cannot even feed your own kid and on top of that you want Laura as well! Well maybe I should act like you then. Work for three euros per hour for any douchebag that comes along. At least I have my style, my babes, my beers, my drinks, my hangouts. What are you doing with your issue... You only know to bust my balls. Whenever a female appears you stand still as if you were a tree. - What issue? - You know what issue. No, I don’t. Tell me. What issue? The fact that you have not slept with a woman for five years now! Oh, that issue... That one is solved. Go to the next. - What? What do you mean? - With Barbara you jackass! At the beach! Who? When? I was almost wiped out by those voodoo freaks and you… Big fucking deal! Either way, this is not the issue. What is it then? That in your stupid mind you think that you will find Laura and start an affair! Why wouldn’t we start an affair? What would be the problem? Because... When we meet her she will get involved with me! What are you on about, you deadbeat? Until yesterday your sign was Virgo and your ascendant Cancer! Not with that thing! What… What happened? You fainted. Before I even hit you. And then you fell asleep. So I left you to rest. Christo, let me tell you something. Speak up. I saw your MRI scan. Is it what it looks like? Well, things are fifty-fifty. I am waiting for the biopsy. You know, there is a village in Africa where, if someone they love dies too early, they hang him upside down from a tree and then they start hitting him with sticks and bats and stuff… To finish him off? Good call. No. For the harm he did them by passing away suddenly, not giving them the opportunity to say goodbye and how much they... Crowded, huh? Runaways to the Vertigo of Imagination Should we check the geographical spot again? Yes, sure. Give me your phone. There is no signal. What now? According to the sextant, the spot we are looking for is right... Here. Excellent! Excellent! Well? Shall we? Where are we? You are nowhere! Or exactly where you wanted to be. Congratulations! Where did you find that? That was a gift. From a special friend. How did you end up here? Like you, looking for Laura. Just a "Runaway to the Vertigo of Imagination". What? You better sit down my friends. I’ve got a couple of things to tell you. I’ve got good news and bad news. First, the bad news. After Laura's disappearance, Vertigo thought of one more promotional gimmick, one last trick: Thousands of bottles with personal messages to be washed ashore on the Mediterranean shores, bottles carrying Laura’s personal message. I need you. Come and save me. I need you now. The message would be a coded map that would show Laura’s whereabouts. Why don’t you find your house in that little map of yours and beat it? Here, take a look for yourselves. You mean Vertigo fooled us. I’ll fuck him up! I still have his phone number! The douchebag! Gentlemen, please. Calm down. I tried to find her. I checked out all the spots on the map. And many others. Until I decided to settle here. On this spot, Vertigo’s coordinates correspond to nothing. So I built up this place. At least, this way all the idiots who end up here may find something relevant to Laura. Are you implying that we are idiots? No not just idiots. Complete morons! I’m implying that you are dorks, you have a PhD in stupidity! And, on top of that, you have also been fooled! Watch your language, you nutso! Antonis, let’s get away from this place! There’s nothing left for us here. Wait. What is the good news? Right... The good news. Oh, yes-yes! What-What? What is the good news? Well, are you ready? Speak up. The good news is that Laura is no more, she is gone forever! Laura is resting in peace, she got away from you all! That was it, leave now! Out! Out! Laura does not exist. Is that understood? It’s all a lie. An illusion. Do you think she really is an illusion? Like the voodoo guy said. Do you think that the whole thing was in our head? Nobody ever saw her again. Do you believe him? God damn! Not again! Mr. Takis? He is away. We can deliver his mail. Very well then. From: Panagiota Verleti, Neos Kosmos To: Mr. Takis Panagiota Verleti? But this is only… Two blocks away from our home! Here we go! Here we go! Power! Power! Score! Score! The backpacks! Dear Takis, I haven't heard from you for a while and I worry a bit. Write me whenever you can how you are and whether you need something. Lately I have been thinking of you a lot. Please take care of yourself and don't forget to take your pills. Everything is good here but it feels as if something is missing. There are some days I am really confused. Sometimes I catch myself staring at the door and thinking of running away. Hello Ms. Virginia! Just leaving, like back then. Maybe you can understand me. Generally speaking, I am calmer now and enjoy the pleasure of anonymity. Where are you going you dumbass? If this is what I was looking for, then maybe I have found it. I really don't know. I hope next time I will be able to write you more. Brothers, what the fuck! They are still here! Get them! I never forget everything you have done for me nor the peacefulness you managed to offer me when I needed it the most. ATHENS Ok, let's not allow this minor detail spoil the moment. I took everything and left. Mary PS : A letter came for the asshole. The biopsy... It's here. Here. - We are here. - Yes. What do we do? Aggelos and Panagiota Verleti 2nd floor Let's run away! Milinko Pantic Thanassis Vekratos Dad, an alien! - We are here to collect the carpets. - We are members of the Red Cross. What's wrong? What do you want? Pfff… Nothing. She went back in. Are you sure? Well, come and find out on your own Sherlock! - Nothing. She went back in. - Are you a moron? - 200 euros for balloons you dick? - 200 euros for plain air! Are you planning to start an amusement park? What are you looking at, you old tart? Excuse me... Are you Laura? I am Panagiota. Can we talk to you for a while? Do you prefer to talk about the carpets or the Red Cross? You live in the neighborhood, don't you? We came a long way to find you. Alright. Let's go for a walk.
