You should take your... - son... - Adam. [GREG] Yeah. You got to take Adam there. Yeah. Miss seeing you around work. That whole thing that happened. You know, they really screwed you. You didn't deserve that. You know, it ended up being all right, you know? - I'm doing good, and... - It's a coffee shop. - What? - Ground floor at work. You called it. It's a coffee shop now. The coffee sucks, but the baristas... Well, look, man. We should catch up sometime. Maybe get in 18 over at Liberty. Yeah. Yeah, that... We definitely got to do that. Cool. Take care of yourself, all right, Cam? I thought it was, like, multiples of four or... Okay. Whatever you say. What, are you just here for, like, motivation? [LAUGHS] Yeah, I'm here for support. [MAN] Nine-one-one, what's your emergency? Hi, can you please send a police officer to nine-three-three Willow Street? My husband just pulled up in my driveway. He's not supposed to be here. Hey. - What are you doing? - Oh, I... I was in between fares, so I thought I'd swing by, see Adam. The police are on their way. - Wh... What? - I have to protect my son. I don't know if you remember, but he's my son, too. [BECCA] You look like shit. - No, I don't. - [BECCA] I'm serious. Are you taking your medication? - Where's Adam? - You know... you're not allowed to see him without supervision, not to mention you're late on your payment again. Why is it always about money with you? You need help. No. No, no, no, Becca. What I need is for you and everyone else on this fucking planet to stop sabotaging me. - Listen. Listen, Becca. - You should go. Just let me see Adam, all right, and let him know that I'm not whatever you and my family are telling him. - No one is telling him anything. - [CAM] You're a fucking liar! That's your problem. You're a fucking liar! Adam, go inside! Hey, buddy! Hey. Hey, look. Whatever your mom's telling you about me, it's, like, it's not true. For some reason, she's trying to turn you against me. You should go now before you lose any right - you have left to him. - Oh, wait a minute. Are you threatening me with my own child? - Is that what you're doing? - What's goin' on here, folks? Officer, he has supervised - visitation and he showed up. - [CAM] Oh, don't fall for these fucking tears! I mean, is this the world that we live in, where... Where a father can't even see his own son? - I need you to calm down. - [CAM] You want me to fucking calm down? I'm asking for a natural right! - Sir... - It's natural, right? - You know what?

[INAUDIBLE] [INDISTINCT CHATTER OVER RADIO] It's your lucky day. She doesn't want to press charges. I've got an ex, too. It's fucked up, but it's reality. The bigger issue here is you can't miss your child support payments. It's... It's like not paying your taxes. You won't just lose visitation with your son, you will go to jail. Trust me, somebody like you does not want to end up in there. So what are you gonna do? I guess I don't have a choice. [PHONE RINGING] - [CAM] Mike. - [MIKE] Hey, Cam. What's up? [CAM] Hey, so, uh, I just... How's... How's Carol and the kids? [MIKE] They're fine. What do you need? Hey, uh, I was... I was looking at my books, and it appears, uh, I'm probably gonna need to borrow some money. - Um... - [MIKE] I thought you were doing - the driving thing? - Well, I am. And that's actually going pretty good, but I just... It's been slow for, like, a week or two, so... [MIKE] Well, if you had a real job, you wouldn't have to worry about that. Look. I wouldn't be asking if I wasn't desperate, so, um... [MIKE] Do you even realize what this is doing to Mom? I appreciate that you and mom talk about me and... But believe me, I am... I'm doing great. It's just I need just a little bit of help for just, you know, a short time period. It's really not that big of a deal. [MIKE] I don't know if she said anything to you yet, but she thinks you need to be in some kind of facility. Um, wow. A... facility. Okay. Um... Right now, I'm kinda focusing on... On dealing with, uh, alimony and child support, so... I... I don't really, uh... [CHUCKLES] - See a facility as an option. - [MIKE] Yeah, and I'm the one that's probably gonna end up having to pay for it, then. So... So what are you... What, you're saying you... You would only help me out for something - that I don't really need? - [MIKE] You're really in no position to make that judgment, are ya? Look, I don't even need it that bad, you know? It's... [MIKE] Then why are you calling me about it? I... I have plenty of options. You know what? I actually got to go. [MIKE] Just don't do anything stupid. Okay. Take care. [MIKE] Cam. Wait. You need help. [CAM] Hi. - [MAN] There you go. Thank you. - [CAM] Thank you. [PHONE BEEPS] [MAZZ SIGHS] The fuck you waiting on? Uh, you to tell me where to go. [MAZZ LAUGHS] Aw, shit.

Yeah, because it's our son. Do you love me? What? [MAZZ] It's a simple fuckin' question, bae. 'Cause you know love without trust ain't shit. Even when we get Prince back. It ain't gonna be the same if we can't trust each other. I know. You can trust me. And because you can trust me and you love me, we need to go get this cash. Say, bruh, we gonna go get some cash. Yeah, just hit this right up here. [CAM] Okay. [MAZZ] Yeah, follow that around. What? I'm just ready for all of this to be over. That's all. - [MAZZ] Yeah, go that way. - Where are we going?

I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so... I'm so sorry. Sorry? - Is that where Prince is? Hmm? - What? With him? Hmm? You ain't just been fuckin' him. You been... You been working with him behind my back? - No! No, that's... - [MAZZ] To rob me? - No, it's not like that! - Is that what it is? [MARINA] No, you listen to me. Listen to me very carefully. He has him. He has Prince. [GUNSHOT] No. [MAZZ SOBS] No! [CAR DOOR CLOSES] Let's go. Keep the car running. [GUNSHOTS] Hey, Becca. [BECCA] Do you know what time it is? Yeah, I just... Sorry, I wanted to talk to you. - [BECCA] Can this wait? - Please, it's important. [BECCA] Are you drunk? No. I'm sorry. [BECCA] It's your business how you act in the rest of your life, Cam, but it comes to Adam... No. I mean about everything. I mean, I know I've been a mess for the past couple months, maybe years. You've been great. [GUNSHOT] - [BECCA] What's going on? - Nothing. Just... - [BECCA] What was that? - I want you to accept my apology. Can you just do that? [BECCA] I can't talk about this tonight. I got to go. - [LINE DISCONNECTS] - Becca? [GUNSHOT] Where you at, Gumby? [SIGHS] [LAUGHS] Oh, man. I thought that shit was a raid, brah. I know you and Marina been playin'. That's the second time you point that gun at me today, man. How long you been playin' in this shit, huh? How many times you just look me in my eyes, nigga, and just... Just lie to me? Ooh. Messing with too much of that shit, man. Fucking with your head. [MAZZ] No, no. I know everything about you and her. You think I would be fuckin' around with my partner's woman, man? [LAUGHING] Dumbass motherfucker. Who told you that bullshit? She did. Mm-hmm. Where Prince? Look, man. I don't know nothing about your boy. [DOOR CREAKS OPEN] - [GUNSHOT] - [MAZZ] What the... [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] - [SCREAMS] - [GROANS] What the fuck is wrong with you! I'd... [GRUNTING] Fucker! Fuck with me one more time, man. [LAUGHS] Get up, man. Get up, man. [LAUGHS] Yeah, man. You're gonna leave me no choice, man. I can't let this shit slide. Don't hurt my son, nigga. Don't do that. Don't hurt my... Are you deaf, man? How many times I got to tell you? I didn't fuck with your kid, you dumb motherfucker! Get that shit through your head, man, all right? - Fuck you, man! - Fuck you! - [GUMBY] Fuck me? Fuck me? - [MAZZ] You got a gun, nigga! Tell the truth! Tell the fuckin'... Tell the truth, nigga! Truth? You want the truth? I fucked your bitch. I fuck the shit out your bitch, man. I've been skimmin' on the package, but I ain't never, never fucked with no little kid, all right? [CAR ENGINE REVVING] You better get that shit through... I'll get this. [MAZZ PANTING] Are you... Are you hurt? Look, should I... take you to a hospital? I'm lost. Yeah. Yeah. I'm... I'm lost, too. I... Before I was a driver, I had a real job. I worked with computers. It was boring as shit, but the pay was good. If I had stayed on the right path and... put in more time, it would have been sweet. I worked hard. I kept my head down. But then, out of nowhere, you know, after eight years, by the way, they informed me that my... They were gonna terminate my position. Motherfuckers get fired from their job every day. Yeah. Well, I didn't see it that way. Next thing I knew, I was on the roof of the building threatening to jump if the company didn't take me back. After that, my wife, well, we split and... now I can't see my son. His name's Adam. I wish someone would've sat me down told me to put my ego and all that bullshit aside. Maybe you should just go back to the motel and drop off the money, I mean, it's your son. What's $20,000 if you can get him back? Right? Who said it was 20,000? Uh... I think... I think you did. You know, I mean, yeah. Or maybe it was Marina. No. I pay attention when people talk money. Yeah, well, you know... Well, I mean... I mean, you've had a long, crazy night, so I would forgive you if you didn't remember. Don't worry about it. Gumby didn't have Prince. What the... What the fuck was Marina - talking about when she... - [CAM] What? - [MAZZ] "He has him." - What are you... [MAZZ] At the dock. That's what she said. "He has him." [CAM] I mean, she had a gun at her head. People would say anything if they had a gun pointed at their head. Come on. I mean, why was that guy trying to kill you? You know what I mean? When you were in that building, did you look around? You know what? I bet if we go back there - we might find your son. - No, we ain't going back. But I just, you know, I can just turn around up here. - No, shut the fuck up. - [CAM] You know? I... - Shut the fuck up. - [CAM] I'm trying to help you. [CAM] You know? It's just, like... Shut the fuck... Where's my son, you piece of shit? - [CAM] What are you doing? - [MAZZ] Hmm? Where is he? I'll spray your brains all over this motherfuckin' car! - Do you want us both to die? - I'll say this one time, boy. - Do you have my son? - I don't know. I don't know. I've been good to you, nigga. I've been good to you, motherfucker! - This how you do me? - That guy was trying - to kill you, I... - Keep quiet. Keep quiet, bitch. You gonna watch your own kid die tonight. Where is my motherfuckin' son, nigga! - Where is he? - [CAM] Sorry. [CAR ENGINE REVVING] [EXPLOSION] [PANTING] [PHONE BEEPING] [PHONE RINGING] [WOMAN] 911, what is your emergency? Yeah. I need to report a... [WOMAN] What seems to be the problem, sir? I woke up this morning, and my car was gone. I think it was stolen. [WOMAN] Are you in immediate danger? I don't think so. [WOMAN] Do you have access to the vehicle's title or registration? I think I can find it. [WOMAN] Why don't you gather that information, and I will transfer your call to the appropriate department.
