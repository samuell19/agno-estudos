You're the third this month. Young people these days! Give them a little hard work and they... That's not it! Then what is it? Huh? I can't read your mind. Tell me! Tell me, okay? I saw it! What did you see? Night Watchman Right... You check over there. Did I scare you? Don't do that! That thing last night was all in your mind. You were here with me! That woman? You saw her! Yes. That was a curtain, that's all. This building's about to be demolished. The wind blows in everywhere. So? So it's all just your imagination. There's no such thing as ghosts. Wait...my shoe's untied. - I'll go on ahead. - Hang on! There's still some noodles... I bought my food. Homemade! Wow! I'll just visit the can. It's all in your mind. All in order But there was a man... But there was an old man... Two women in kimonos... Two women... All in order, but there was a man. All in order, but there was an old man. All in order, but there were two women in kimonos... What's this? You gotta laugh. You'd think if a kid wanted to quit, he'd come up with a better reason! The building contractor's been complaining. He wonders why we've got such a high staff turnover. - What's the nearest station? - Huh? I'll go tonight and check it out. You will? Sorry to call you in so suddenly but i couldn't find anyone else. Hey, I can't say no to the Chief! Who are you? I'm Nakatani. The company sent me over to work here. - What about the other guy? - He quit. He quit too, huh? I'm Yoshizawa. Glad to meet you. My pleasure. After we check the fire escape and the roof we're done. Fine. - Worked here long, Mr. Yoshizawa? - Forget the "Mister". About three month since the demolition here started. - Thats quite a while. - Compared to the others. Bunch of chickens! Hang on... which key is it? This one. There. Let me hit the can. Okay. Hey... is anybody here? Who's there? Hey! Hey! Mitsuba, Security... Chief! What's wrong? They're here! Huh? Who's there? Ghosts! What?! Forget it!

To hell with this place. - I'm out of here! - Hey, wait! Ghosts! What? Forget it! To hell with this place. - I'm out of here! - Hey, wait! Who was that?! Where's the lights? There. I guess Yoshizawa's not here yet. All right... Whoa! Don't do that! What's so funny? Chief? So are there ghosts in here or not? Of course not, Chief. - No, huh? - That's right. But you get tired working here. You can't sleep. Why not? When i fall asleep a woman comes down from the ceiling. What? No, no... it's just a dream. Give me a break! But she's laying down, she comes horizontal. So her hair should be hanging down to the floor. But it lays out horizontal,too. It defies gravity. So it'd have to be a dream, wouldn't it? Where does she appear? There. Where? Above your head. Yeah? That's creepy... Hey... Your neck... Oh, here? The woman from the ceiling tries to strangle me. No, I must be doing it to myself in my sleep. That's why I wake up. Are you really all right here? Yeah, I'm fine. What was that? Footsteps. - Is someone here? - Of course not! - Then why the footsteps? - It's children running around. Huh? That's all in your mind,too. Oh! What? Time to make the rounds. I'll do it. You sit here and drink your tea. - Hey. - Be right back. I don't like this. I'll go, too. Hey... Yes? Say something. After this it's just the fire escape. Well... ... I guess there's nothing to it. The ghosts? There aren't any ghosts! Yeah, but the way you were talking... It's all in the mind, I said. You get tired beeing up all night. I guess so. Oh! What? Stop laughing like that. I forgot the key. Oh man! Who's there? Who's there? Oh, you saw it? It looks like someone's there, but it's just the shadows. And that's the rounds. Huh? Hey... Yes? - What about in here? - No, I don't like going in there. I see. Wait... It's part of the job. All right. Which key is it? This one? What the hell? Are these self-flushing toilets? Not in a building this old. Then why... Forget it. It happens all the time. Hey, wait! Please take that way. I'll go over here. What a place! Just ignore them! All in order But there were men, woman, and children. Chief? Is that you? It is you! It's been a while. What happened? You look different. I quit. I'm looking for another job. You did? What about you? I'm still in the same building. 'Bye. It's all in the mind. Directed by AKIO YOSHIDA TALES OF TERROR Tachibana! Yes? Get in here! The Section Chief wants us all to sing! He's coming!

We went left. - ?We should have gone right. - And you just sat there? Why didn't you tell me, i feel stupid! Sorry. Now we're really lost! Should we go back to the hotel and start over?

Wouldn't you, Mariko? You didn't know? She's been there. What? Things happen. Should we go back? Huh? What's wrong? Well... I'll come to you. Where are you? Where are we? The wind again?

Hurry up! Tomomi? What's going on here? Stop it, will you? I know what you're doing. Both of you. You're trying to freak me out. Well, it's not going to work! TALES OF TERROR Directed by HIROHISA SASAKI Yo. Gloves Do you always work this late? A designer, hug? That's what you always used to say you wanted to do. Maps. I get sent out to places to draw maps. It's not designing. I just do what they tell me. My income goes up and down and so do my hours. I see. But I'm sure glad you hadn't moved. You waited for me. Don't get the wrong idea. It's just for tonight. Tomorrow you leave. When I first arrived in Tokyo and didn't know up from down... ... i fell in love with a guy where I was working. You're cooking's gotten a lot better. Anyone could make this. Thanks. All of a sudden we were living together here. It's good. We even thought of getting married, but... Good night. Aw, man! Women! She never gives up! I want to break up... ... but she always makes a scene and says she's going to kill herself. She just won't quit! Not like you at all. You're the same way. You're no different from her. I've got to go. All right. Can I come back sometime? What are you talking about? I didn't ask where he was living now or where he was working. There wasn't any point. But the one night... Ow! It hadn't been a dream. It went on night after night... He was the one doing it. That's all I could think. Every night it got stronger. I couldn't sleep any more. Sorry... I asked him about this weird thing... ... that was happening every night. ... strangling me. I've been having dreams, too. Apparently every night he dreamed he was coming to my apartment. The coincidence amazed me. That night the strange phenomenon stopped. I don't know why but its stopped. As if nothing had happened, the days went by. He wasn't the one who'd been strangling me. The hands were those of the woman who loved him. Soon after I moved from that apartment... ... and never heard from him again. Now I have no way of knowing where he is or how he's doing... ... and even if I did it wouldn't make a difference. The End TALES OF TERROR Directed by KOSUKE SUZUKI The Weight Don't! Go away! No! No!

Beforce my Uncle came home there were things I had to do... ... and things i wanted to. Hi! I'm here! Come in. Wow! This is great! Yeah? You're family must be rich!

His name isn't Kazunori, by the way. Kazunori... Directed by KEITA AMEMIYA TALES OF TERROR Sign here, please. Right here. Here? Yes. Thank you very much. Hisao, are you done eating? A whole box of persimmons again, from your aunt in Kiyosato... I told her you don't like them. Why can't she get it through her head? Would you like some? No, eh? I know... I'll take them to Mrs. Kamata. I can do that later. You've tracked water in again! Hisao Hisao... what would you like for supper? Let's see... ...there's meat and potatoes... Shall we have beef stew? We haven't had that for a while. What's the time? It'll be ready about 7:30, all right? It's been ages! I used to make it all the time. That's the one thing you'd always ask for more of. Oh, don't feel that you have to ask for seconds... I didn't mean anything like that. I'm sorry. I'm just not very good with words. I know that hurts you sometimes... Hisao... ... how are things at school? I'm sorry. I know you don't like to talk about it... ... but I hear things. What are those boy's names? Kamiya and Narahashi? You don't seem to be getting along with them lately. They haven't gone to school much since you all started Grade... Those little motorcycles... mopeds... They ride them down by the station. I hear they make a real nuisance of themselves. Mr. Saito's worried about you. He says those boys borrow money from you. We don't have to talk about this now. I'm not someone who has to know everything. I'm sure there's nothing wrong. It's good you've finally made some friends, isn't it? Hisao, are there any girls that you're friendly with? What's her name...Asako? I saw her the other day. She's certainly pretty enough... But what's she really like? She spends a lot of time with Kamiya, doesn't she? She was at a private girl's school. I'm told she dropped out in September. That must have been hard on her parents. Is it true you were lending her money, too? I know you won't like me saying this... ... but you shouldn't do that for people like Asako and Kamiya. You know sometimes go out without saying where you're going... I mean, it's all right if you're friends with Kamiya... ... but if you're not... ... I get a little worried. I'm sorry... Ms. Mizukawa, that girl in B told me that morning... ... Kamiya and the others were beating you up behind the school. It was this time of year... ... when they said you went swimming in that pond! I just can't believe that, you know. I mean, you grew up around here! You know how deep it is! All your life I've told you, it's dangerous, don't go in there. You always said you wouldn't! At your wake Kamiya and the others said they didn't know anything. They said... ... you went in there yourself and drowned! I don't believe that for a minute! Asako told me... ... that you... ... wouldn't give them any more money... ... so they took you to the pond and started hitting you. they beat you senseless... ... then got scared... ... and threw you in the water! You know... I'm going to go see Kamiya and Narahashi. I should hear what they have to say. Don't you worry. I won't say anything stupid. I won't embarrass you. I'll just ask what happened. It'll be all right. It's true that when parents get involved in children's quarrels... ... things get difficult. I understand, you know. It's hard sometimes to be a sweet and gentle soul. Still... ... I always liked that about you. After all, people have to be kind to each other, don't they? What were we talking about? Oh, yes... Kamiya and the others. It's okay, Mom. Hmm? Why? It's not okay. It's not okay at all! There's nothing okay about it! Nakanishi speaking... Oh, hello. Thank you for the persimmons. I'll have some with Hisao. What, on television? Witnesses say that suddenly... very suddenly the two mopeds... ... plunged vertically into the river. Oh, dear! They're dead? Dead are two Eishin High School students... ... Koichi Kamiya and Shoji Narahashi both 18. They're dead... both of them. Did you do that? Why? And here I was going to do it! I wouldn't have minded. You are... ... really... ... a nice boy. I'm glad. I feel a lot better now. It's a relief. Now we'll have time to talk about things. I've quit my job. I'll have time now. I want to find out the things you like. We'll... ... do things together now. Mommy's all right now. Now I'll always... ... be with you. Directed by SHUNICHI HIRANO I lay my hand on your hand gently. But now, I can't feel the warmth of your hand. I want you to hold me... just once. We could feel each other anytime, but now we are apart. When I look back, I can oly remember our sweet memories. I have lost my body and I have been separated from you. Even though you can't see me, I want you to find me. My sadness is endlessly echoing in my heart. I'm always by your side, but you can never see me. My sadness is endless...
