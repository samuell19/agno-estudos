Play one of the best new FPS shooters, search Steam for PROJECT WARLOCK Thie is the story of a time long ago. A time of myth and legend, when the earth was still young. The ancient gods were petty and cruel, and they played mankind for their sport. Aaaagh! Plaguing them with suffering, besieging them with terrors. ( Laughing ) For centuries, the people had nowhere to turn, no one to look to for help. Until... he arrived. He was man like no other. Born of a beautiful mortal woman, but fathered by Zeus, king of the gods. Hercules possessed strength the world had never seen, a strength surpassed only by the power of his heart. But everywhere he went he was tormented by his stepmother, Hera, the all-powerful queen of the gods. Hera's eternal obsession was to destroy Hercules, for he was the constant living reminder of Zeus' infidelity. No matter the obstacle, as long as there were people crying for help, there was one man who would never rest: Hercules. Pithus. - Let's turn back. - No. Somebody's got to make it through. Somebody's got to bring back help. It's no use. Think how many men our village has sent. None of them ever made it. I'm with Lethan. We should go back. Back to what? A life of fear? Under siege? At least we're living. No. We're gonna make it through. - ( Distant Animal Roaring ) - What was that? What was what? ( Sighing ) I guess it was nothing. ( Distant Animal Sounding ) What are you? Show yourselves. They're all around us. Aaaargh! Aaaargh! ( Screaming Continues ) Lethan! I think he's dead! No. Aargh! Pithus! Pithus! Come on, llus, kick! - ( Screaming ) - Come on, kick! Fight it, fight it! Pithus! ( Screaming ) My legs! ( Screaming Continues ) Run! Run! Run! Run! Go! Hey! - Can I play? - You can't! - Why not? - 'Cause it's a boy's game. Now, give us back our ball and go play with a doll. He's right, Lilia. Now come and help me wash your father's feet. You wanted to know when he got here, right? Well, he's coming up the street right now. MAN: One day only! One day only! Aaargh! Hey, wait, listen. It's bad luck for the best man to kill the groon before the wedding. All right. I'll wait 'til after the wedding. ( Grunting ) ( Laughing ) It's good to see you, Hercules. You look great. You too, Iolaus. And congratulations. Come have a drink. Help me celebrate. Sorry. I have to get to my mother's house. She'll be worrying. Why don't you walk with me? We can get caught up. ( Laughing ) Hercules. HERCULES: It's been a while, my friend. IOLAUS: I'm surprised you survived this last one without me at your back. ( Laughing ) It's not the same without you. I'm glad you could make it home, Hercules. I hope the rest of the world can get by without you for a week or so. Are you kidding? Nothing's gonna keep me from your wedding. You know, when I got the news, I couldn't believe it. Now, seeing you... I still can't believe it. Hmmm. You'll be giving up a lot, Iolaus. Have you thought about that? You make it sound like I'm falling off the edge of the earth. No, no. Not at all. Who knows? I'll probably get a wife or two myself someday. So, who is this girl? Is she pretty? Ania. Yeah, she's very pretty. I could sit and look at her all day. - Look at her? - Yeah. She's, you know, beautiful. Well, you'll eat better once you have a wife to cook for you. Actually, Ania's not much of a cook. - How bad? - Really bad. Well, at least you'll have someone to look after your livestock. You won't have to pay a foreman who steals you blind. - Well-- - She's not good with animals, either? No. They're scared to death of her. Ha! She can't cook, she's not good with animals. Can she at least sew you some better clothes? Nope, can't sew a stitch. Don't even ask what I paid for her. - What did you pay for her? - Seven cows, three goats, eleven chickens. - Eleven chickens! - ( Laughing ) Yeah, I know. But she's got this little mole, right here. Drives me crazy. What can I tell you? You can tell me what happened to the Iolaus I used to know. Well, love happened to me, Hercules. - Oh. - I don't expect you to understand it. I can hardly understand it myself. Are you really willing to give up your whole life for a woman? ( Laughing ) Someday, Hercules, you're going to meet a woman unlike any other. Then you'll know what I'm talking about. Me? Never. - ( Faint Whimpering ) - Iolaus, do you hear that? ( Whimpering Continues ) Hey, there. What's the matter? What are all these tears about? The monster killed my father. We were praying to the goddess, and a monster came and ate him. And after he ate him, he spit out all his bones. So, a monster did all this, huh? - Why don't you tell me about him? - He's big and ugly. He eats you. He's never full. He's always hungry. No one can get by him. I bet not even Hercules could get by him. Well, Hercules has the heart of a rabbit compared to me. Now, where's this terrible monster? I don't want it to hear me. That's a good idea. Monsters have excellent hearing. - ( Laughing ) - Hercules. Are you all right? What is it? What's it doing? I don't know. But I've got a feelin' it's gonna be ugly. ( Growling, Hissing ) Don't, Iolaus. Don't provoke it. - ( Roaring ) - What are you doing? ( Roaring Continues ) ( Roaring Continues ) - Look out! - Aaaargh! Come on. ( Roaring Continues ) ( Roaring Slowly Fading ) Come on, let's get out of here. - This thing stinks. - Yeah. - What the hell was that? - Ania the day after you marry her. - Hey! - ( Growling ) ( Roaring ) ( Hercules Shouting ) Iolaus, grab that torch. - But the gods, they'll be angry. - Just get it! ( Panting ) ( Screaming ) IOLAUS: Help me! Iolaus, the torch. Quick, give it to me. ( Roaring Weakens ) What was that? If you cut off its head, the thing grows another one. And another one! Hera. I should have known she was behind this. - You think so? - I know so. Hercules, don't do it. Are you crazy? She's the queen of the gods! Take a lesson, Iolaus. She's a pertect example of what happens when a woman gets too much power. Well, here we are, Hercules. Some places never change. The thing I never forget about my mother's house us her flowers I always thought they smelled like her. Yeah, yeah. ( Chuckling ) ( Shrieking ) Hercules, put me down! Oh, oh, it's so good to see you. What happened? You're hurt. Did you get in a fight? I'm just in the door, and you're already worrying. I always worry about you, hercules. It's a constant, sweet ache called motherhood. Congratulations, Iolaus. - I think marriage will be good for you. - Thank you I think so too. Ania's sure a beautiful girl. Yes, she is. I ought to be getting back to her. Oh, I almost forgot. Ania told me to invite you both over tonight. She... wants to make dinner. - Oh! - Mmm. A dinner would be lovely. Good. Then I'll see you both tonight. Uh-huh. Sit down. Let me wash your feet. - I brought something for you. - Oh? What is it? A present. - Spices from Alturia. - ( Laughing ) - I thought you might like them for your cooking. - How very sweet. So, are you going to tell me how you got that cut of not? I met a kid on the road. She turned into a "thing." It was completely unprovoked. Another one of Hera's creations, no doubt. That bitch! I wish my father would find a way to do something about her. Has he been around much? - Who? Zeus? - Yeah. From time to time. Mother, if he ever starts talking about moving in here with you-- Hercules, he gave me a son, the son of a god. I'm happy with that. It doesn't bother me that he was never around. In fact, it was probably better that way. Why don't I see what I can do for that wound? ( Whooshing Sound ) She's always saying those things, ha, ha, but deep inside... she's still crazy about me. I should have known you'd show up now. Where were you when I was battling that beast of Hera's a little while ago? - We barely came through it. - Aha, but you did. You always do. I thought you were gonna talk to her, get her off my back. She is your wife. I tried, but Hera's a woman. And there's no changing a woman that doesn't want to be changed. I've found it best to stay out of her way... and find my amusements... elsewhere. Is that what you're here for? To give me advice about women? No, I'm here to see how my favorite son is doing. Well, I'm doing great. Thank you for asking. Especially now that I'm back home. I've got to tell you I'm very proud of you. Your name's become a legend. Everywhere I go, people are talking about you. I have to admit I haven't been a very good father, but you're... a wonderful son. Uh, where's your mother? Oh, no, no. You leave her alone. - What're you talking about? - You know. She's not one of your amusements. I just want to say hello. How are you? You-- you look wonderful. You haven't changed, either. Oh, come on, I'm-- Uh, would you care to join us for a meal? Um, no, I don't think I can. I have an appointment, and I just came by to see... how my boy was doing. He's doing fine. And you're as beautiful as ever. - ( Banging ) - Ooh! Hey, there, pretty one. Why don't you stick around? ( Laughing ) Too young for you, anyway. - Uuh! - Oh! I'm sorry, I-- I hope they're gonna like it, because this is one of my best recipes. - I'm sure it'll be great. - Try it. - And if it's not, that's okay. - But I want them to like me. They're gonna like you. They're gonna love you. - I know I do. - It's nice to know I'm marrying a smart man. - You forgot good-looking. - No, I didn't. What's this? A man in the kitchen? Go on, get out of here. Go on. All right, all right. So, Hercules, what do you think? - I think there's a weird smell coming from the kitchen. - No! About Ania. Isn't she great? She's very pretty. I bet she'll give you some good-looking sons. Hercules! I made extra for you. I hope you're hungry. Mmm. This is, um... great! - ( Gasping ) - Ania, what is it? I saw somebody looking in the window. - ( Thudding ) - Oh! Oooooh! - Who are you? - I'm sorry. My name is Pithus. I'm here to look for Hercules. - I'm Hercules. - Thank the gods. I've searched the whole town looking for you. Now that you've found me? It's my home, Gargarensia. We're under attack. - You have to help us. - What kind of attack? Beasts. Ferocious beasts that live in the forest surrounding our village. They come in the night, attacking us as we sleep. They steal our livestock, destroy our crops. - Can't your men fight them? - We tried. We sent out our best warriors and hunters. They never returned. They were all killed? We're just simple men left, farmers and fishermen. The beasts have turned us into prisoners in our own village. - How is it you were able to come here? - By the luck of the gods. Two others left with me. They're dead now. Please, Hercules. They're about to attack again soon. I wouldn't ask this of you, but... I don't know if my people can survive this time. - How far is it to Gargarensia? - Two days' travel. Get yourself some food and some rest. We'll leave tomorrow at first light. Thank you, Hercules. May the gods smile on you. Better they just stay out of my life. Sounds pretty bad. I wonder what we're up against? We're not up against anything. Your adventure days are over. You're getting married, remember? That's a week away. This'll be two days out, kill a few horrible beasts, two days back. - Still, I don't think-- - Come on. It's our last chance together. Best friends, fighting, back-to-back. It'll make a great wedding present, Hercules. ( Laughing ) All right. Best friends, back-to-back. But what're you gonna tell Ania? Well, Hercules really wants me to go. He gave me this whole speech about "best of friends," "last time," all of that. So, you don't want to go? - It's Hercules? - Yeah. He practically begged me. I really wish you weren't going. I was hoping we'd have more time this visit. I know. I don't expect you to understand, but... these people need me. If I don't go, it could mean their lives. I do understand. Just promise me you'll be careful. - Always. - ( Laughing ) They look so wonderful together. - Yeah, but she's changed him so much! - ( Alcmene laughing ) Someday, Hercules, you'll find a woman who'll do the same to you. You sound just like Iolaus. I'm gonna miss you. It's only for a few days. Besides, after next week you're gonna be stuck with me forever. Unless I marry somebody else while you're gone. - You'd do that? - I might. Well, you'll be setting for second best. You're never going to find anyone who loves you as much as I do. Are we going, or are we just hanging around kissing the women? Hercules, I'm counting on you to make sure he gets back to marry me. Oh, I'll have him back in plenty of time. Don't you worry. Bye, Ania. Gargarensia is just beyond those mountains. IOLAUS: Hey, Hercules. I got a surprise for you. - What is it? - Ania made us some food for the road... in case we got hungry. ( Together ) Pithus, did you eat yet? ( Laughing ) ( Grunting ) ( Grunting ) It's Pithus. Hey, everyone! Pithus is back! - Hey, everybody, I'm back. - By the gods, I was sure he was dead. This is Hercules. I brought him back to save Gargarensia. Everybody, come on out! Come on out, everyone. It's Hercules, everybody. He's come to help us! MAN: Wonderful, wonderful. Where's Franco? Is Franco here? Father, you made it. Franco! Oooh! Ha, ha, ha. Look, I brought Hercules to help us. I've heard of you, hercules. You're the strongest and bravest! - Let me be your guide. I'll lead you to them. - Franco, I don't think so. Hercules already has a partner. You know, there's something missing in this town. Pithus, where are the women? Well, um, they-- - Well, they-- - They were stolen by the beasts. Yeah, Years and years ago. - ( Crying ) - But he can't be more than a year old. Sometimes babies are left on the riverbank. You mean they're abandoned? Whose are they? - They belong to us. - But whose were they? - We raise them as our own. - Where do they come from? I told you. They're left on the riverbank. Why do I get the feeling we're not getting the whole story? 'Cause we're not. Look, have any of you ever seen the beasts? - Mm-hmm. - What do they look like? The one I saw looked like a wolf. The one I saw had a face of a bear. The one I saw looked more like a hawk. - What do you think? - I don't know. But I have a feeling we'll find out as soon as we meet these creatures face to face. FRANCO: Good-bye, Hercules. Good luck! MAN: Good-bye, now. MAN: Good-bye! One thing's for sure, those men are scared, every one of 'em. - What about you? - Me? What have I got to be scared of? - Whatever's out there in those woods. - Come on. There's nothing anywhere that can frighten me. - Unless, of course, it's more of Ania's cooking. - Hey! So, Hercules. How come, in all the years I've known you, - I've never seen you carry a weapon? - What do I need a weapon for? Because... maybe the other guy has one. So let him carry it. I let you do that. ( Laughing ) - So what do you think of "Iolaus Junior"? - "Iolaus Junior"? Yeah. For my firstborn. - What if it's a girl? - No girls. - Ania and I agreed. Five sons. - All named Iolaus! I've gotta remember them all, don't I? ( Laughing ) Where are these beasts? I hope we haven't come all this way for nothing. - Be patient. We'll find them. - Yeah, yeah. Hey! What do you think? Some kind of warning? Maybe it's just the way these beasts have fun. - ( Faint Animal Sound ) - Over there. Keep your eyes open, Iolaus. They're watching us right now. I can feel it. Me too. Well, Iolaus, you wanted an adventure. ( Gasping ) ( Choking ) - Where'd my sword go? - Who needs a sword? Forget it. - Yeah, thanks. - Hold on. - Be careful, Iolaus. - No, be reckless. Careful dies, reckless kills. Fantastic, aren't they? Ow! No, Iolaus. Stay at my back. Hercules! It's a woman! Iolaus! Ugh! We fought well, you and me. You're not going to die, Iolaus. You can't We said we'd go out together. Back-to-back heroes. - I can't wait, Hercules. - Iolaus, no. Tell Ania how much I wanted to be her husband. Good-bye, my friend. ( Breathing Unevenly ) Iolaus. No, stop. The queen will want to kill him. The enemy may look insurmountable, but he is just flesh and blood. Use his strength to destroy him, to defeat him. His strength will be his weakness, his pride his downfall. We fight because we have to fight. We fight for our way of life. The day we do not fight for who we are and what we can be... is the day they take it away from us again, as they always have before. Now, that's a good one, Lysia. I'll give you three goats... and a wagon of hay for him. - Not for sale. This one's going to the queen. - Not the man. The horse! My father used to chase my mother with one of these. No one chases me. If you're looking for men, you won't find any, not in the city of Amazons. You're the only one. And I don't think you'll last very long. I'm sure you're used to having your way with women. I bet they just fall at your feet whereever you go. Well, not here! - Here, you fall at our feet. - Ugh! So... this is the great Hercules, come to destroy us. Wash her feet. ( Grunting ) You'd rather die than assume the role of a woman, wouldn't you? Women of Amazon, this is Hercules, champion of men. He is the best the enemy has to offer, and you've put him in chains. Be proud of yourselves. You don't know what to make of us, do you, champion? You've never been defeated before, certainly not... by a band of women. If you only knew how much pleasure this gives me. Pleasure is the last thing I'd give you, you murdering bitch! There's not a question of you giving it, only whether or not I want to take it. Did you take pleasure in killing Iolaus? Sorry about your friend, but we have every right to defend ourselves. After all, you came to destroy us. - That's not true. - What is? You were lost? Two lost lambs, wandering in the woods? We were sent by the men across the river. And they sent you to destroy us! They sent us to destroy a beast. We didn't know the beast was you. Ah. They told you we were beasts? Still so stuffed with male pride they had to lie to you. From what I've seen it wasn't a lie. We're not beasts, Hercules. We are women. Hardly. Just because we're not the kind of women you'd like us to be, make no mistake, these are women. Women who will not be controlled by men, not beaten down, not bought and sold like oxen. Men will never dominate these women. We don't dominate you. We protect you. ( Laughing ) Oh, I see. You protect us. Because you're weaker. Am I? I don't think so. You've got an advantage... at the moment. Yes, I suppose I do. What are you looking at, Hercules? Do you find me attractive? My legs, my breasts, my lips? Your friend is dead, I've got you in chains, you hate me. And yet you still desire me. You're pathetic. There's no point in talking to you anymore. You'll never understand what makes a woman. You'll never understand what makes a man. You don't know anything about me. Oh, but I do. LYSIA: Come. I'll show you. I'll show you exactly what it is that makes a man. Go back. Go back and live your life again. Let's see who you really are. ( Crying ) ( Crying ) Now we'll see who you really are, Hercules. Now, be a good boy while I bathe. Oooh-hoo, my! Look at who I see. ( Laughing ) How has this big, wide world been treating you? It's all out there for you, son. More than you can imagine. Yours is gonna be such a wonderful life. And women. Let me tell you, there's nothing... like a beautiful woman. Believe me, women are the sweetest journey... you will ever take. But don't be a afraid. Take a lot of them. ( Laughing ) Did you see, Hercules? That's who you are. The son of your father. Women mean nothing to him, nor to you. They're just play toys to be used and then thrown away. Your father, all fathers teach this to their sons... on the day that they're born, and it doesn't change as you grow older. ( Shouting ) What-- what do you say we call it a draw? Good match, Hercules, Iolaus. You should be proud of yourselves. You've become the best fighters in the class. You've all come a long way. You're ready to graduate. You'll be leaving here soon. Take with you the truths you've learned. When you fight, fight to the death. Cultivate hardness, because a man is stone. If you have any emotions left, grind them to the dust. Emotions are for the weak, the girls! Most of all, remember: You'll be known by the enemies you make. So, make good ones. - Hey! - ( Boys Together ) Hey! You and me, Iolaus, we'll fight back-to-back and die together, battlefield heroes. We die together? A promise? There again, women are nothing in your world. They're weak, polluted with emotion. But what great thing is it to be a man? Hammered into killing tools. No feelings except for enemies. No strengths but those to destroy. Tell me. When has a man brought life into the world? When does a man deliever anything but death? - Be careful, Iolaus. - No, be reckless. Careful dies, reckless kills. Ow! No, Iolaus! Stay at my back! ( Grunting ) ( Hippolyta's Voice ) You have no idea what women are. But you've had your first lesson today. Hercules! It's a woman! Ahhhh! Iolaus! ( Shuddering, Whimpering ) It's not my intention that you should suffer needlessly. It's not a female trait. You loved Iolaus. I believe that. He was my best friend. We went through a lot together. I should have never let him come along. You surprise me. It seems somehow that a spark of humanity has survived inside you. Could you love a woman as you loved Iolaus? It's different with women. Why? Women need respect and loyalty just as much as you do. But you will never understand that. What if I tried to change? You can't change. You're a man. But if I learned to be the way I am, I can learn to be another way. - Why should I believe you? - You shouldn't. But something tells me you're strong enough to take the chance. No. Men can learn nothin expect how to deceive and dominate and kill. - So show me another way. - No. I don't think you could even if you wanted to. - And why do you say that? - Because you don't know any other way. You've become exactly like the men you hate. I've had enough of this conversation with you. ( Sheep Bleating, Chickens Clucking ) What are you doing? Who's the little girl? Why are you looking at me like that? She's never seen a man before. - And you? - Yes. I've just never talked to one. - So is that what you want? To talk? - Sort of. - What do you mean, sort of? - I want to know somehthing. Like what? At night sometimes, I've heard the older women speaking. They don't know I can hear them. Is it true, in other places men and women live together? Why do you ask me? Doesn't Hippolyta teach you everything you need to know? Of course she does. It's just that sometimes I get these feelings inside, and I wonder what the enemy's all about. Yeah, well, that makes three of us. What about you? Is that what you've come here for? You, you came from Gargarensia. Did you see a little boy there? Well, there are many little boys. Yeah, well, he'd be ten. Fair haired, with a freckle on his right cheek. - You mean Franco? - Franco. How is he? He's fine. I mean, he's-- You're his mother, aren't you? No! Why, why, no, no. What are you doing in here? No one is to talk to this dog. Get out! If it were up to me, you wouldn't be caged, you'd be buried. You know, normally I like to see a woman with a little fire in her eyes. ( Laughs ) But this one is all fire. - What are you doing here? - I just came to see if I could help you. ( Laughing ) Help? From you? That's a new one. Give me a little credit! You don't see the other gods dropping in on their kids. What can I do? You can tell me how to understand women. Oh, understand women! Who can understand them? They're full of feelings and instincts, and they can always outguess you. But tell me, what are you doing here? I mean, this cage can't hold the strongest man in the world. It's not the cage that's keeping me here. It's Hippolyta, all right? There's something about her. Well, she's very beautiful. It's not that. She's... different somehow. She's got strength and power. ( Laughs ) You know, I fell for strength and power. And what did I wind up with? Hera? I've just got to get her to change her mind. Women don't do that! At least not when you want them to. Son, just think back about all the things... I taught you about women. I have been. I'm thinking maybe you were wrong. Oh! Huh. Well, maybe I was. But remember: These Amazons are Hera's favorites. You mess around with them, you're gonna make her very unhappy. Since when have either of us ever cared about Hera's happiness? Well, I warned you. ( Thunder Rumbling ) ( Bracelets Click ) Hera. HERA: You've done well, Hippolyta. You've made me proud with the capture of Hercules. It's only with the strength that you have given us that we were able to defeat him. We owe our victory to you. Tell me, why is it he's still alive? I didn't see the need to kill him. I'm not so sure he's the enemy. All men are the enemy. Haven't I taught you that? But Hercules seems different. He doesn't seem as bad as-- Don't be a fool. Hercules is the worst of them. He wants to control you, to control everything. You have to kill him now, while you can. - But I have spoken with him-- - Are you refusing to obey me? No, of course not. I would never-- Then do as I say. Kill him. ( Thunderclap ) Yes, Hera. And the moment he's dead, I want you to carry out the attack on the Gargarensians. ( Thunderclap ) It will be done. ( Gong Chimes ) Lysia, spread the word among the women. We attack the Gargarensian men tonight. My warriors will be ready and at your call. Good. Now go. There's something I've got to do. ( Grunts ) ( Birds Chirping ) ( Chattering ) Hey, It's Hercules! He's back. - We thought you were dead. - There's no time to explain. The women are coming to attack. Gather your weapons, get ready to defend yourselves. - I don't have a weapon. - Neither do I. I'm just a farmer. Hercules, I told you. We're not warriors. - We don't know how to fight them. - Would you rather die? Are you gonna let them slaughter you, your sons? Hercules, there's something more we need to tell you about their attack. ## ( Drums ) ## ## ( Women Chanting ) ## ## ( Chanting Continues ) ## We ride tonight... with the strength that Hera has given us... and the strength that we have earned for ourselves. Take what you need, but be quick. Stay only until the sound of the horn. The moment you hear it, we ride away. Now, to your horses! ( Shouting, Cheering ) ( Horses Whinnying ) ( Men Chattering ) Hercules, they're coming. All right, now go. Remember to od everything exactly as I told you. - What about the horn? - I'll take care if it. Now get going. ( Horses Whinnying ) ( Women Shouting ) Go, but be careful. There's no telling what kind of trap Hercules has laid for us. And remember, you have only until the sound of the horn. ( Horse Neighs, Whinnies ) Don't keep me waiting. You know what I'm here for. What's all this? I thought maybe we could talk first. Talk? About what? You. Who you are. I want to know all about you. There's no time for that. Now take your clothes off! There's plenty of time. Please. Quickly! Take your clothes off! - ( Gasps ) - Take... your... clothes... off! I will if you tell me your name. No names! We're in a hurry. But you must tell me. You see, I've written you a love song. And without your name, it has no title. Franco! What's he doing here? He's not supposed to be here. Are you my mother? I sometimes dream of you. But I can't remember your face. Please let me see your face. I beg you to please be gentle with me. Or, if you wish, rough. ( Laughs ) A moment is all I need. When the horn sounds, you'll never see me again. Oh. Oh, after an attack like that, I-- I suppose you're hungry. The rules are: no small talk, just sex. Ah... I see. Well... ( Laughing ) as you wish. ( Thunderclap ) ( Horse Neighs ) So this is the big attack that they told me about. Stay clear of me, Hercules. You're lucky to be alive as it is. I thought your women didn't need men. We don't. But we do need what they have. It's the only way to be sure there'll be daughters to take over when we're gone. And if the babies are male, you abandon them on the riverbank. - We have no use for them. - Seems like an insane way of living you've developed. Hera's happy. That's good enough. - Is it? - Yes, it is. I thought you didn't want to be controlled. No one controls us. Hera does. You obey her every word. Not every word. She ordered me to kill you. Then why haven't you? - Maybe I will. Then do it now. ( Drops Knife ) Why are you in such a hurry to separate them? Why don't you give them a chance just to talk? Talk isn't what we came for. Are you afraid they're gonna find out they don't have to hate each other? I'm protecting them from the lies those men will tell if given a chance. Those people down there belong together. The Gargarensians need your women. My women don't need them. Yes, they do. They told me themselves. They feel an emptiness. - Don't lie to me. - You know I'm not lying. You feel that same emptiness, don't you? Stop it. No man is going to make me want him. I won't be that weak. It's not weak to admit what you're feeling. It takes strength and courage. Don't be afraid. I'm not afraid of anything. No? Then you're not afraid of this, you're not afraid of this... and you're not afraid of this. I told you, I'm not afraid of anything. ( Birds Chirping, Rooster Crows ) Do you have any children? I have a little girl. She's four. She must be a cute little thing. She is. And she has your silly smile. Silly smile? Silly smile? ( Both Laughing ) He's such a beautiful boy. - Yeah. - You've done well with him. I do my best. But what he really needs is a mother. This feels like heaven. Oh, darling... heaven was never like this. What's the matter? This has gone on long enough. ( Horn Blaring ) Her name's Chilla. Every moment with her was fantastic. We talked about her, about me, about everything. And to think, up until now, I was always afraid of her. I know what you mean. You should've seen Ilea. When she took her mask off, I nearly cried. She was so beautiful! Her hair glowed in the moonlight. I'm still a little afraid I was having some kind of vision. Well, if it was a vision... we had one too! ( All Laughing ) And I met my mother. Hey! Hercules, you've given our village life again. We owe everything to you. Thank you, Hercules. Things are gonna be much better now the women are coming back. That's if the women come back. They're gonna come back. They're gonna want more. What woman wouldn't? Yeah, they'll be back. And think how much better it'll be. Our clothes will be mended. We'll eat better. It'll be back to the way it should be. Yeah! - Right. - What wrong with you? Those attitudes are exactly what got you into all this trouble in the first place. The women aren't the ones who have to work around here. It's you men, all of you. Hercules is right. Things went the way they did last night... because we talked to them, we listened to them. That's right, you did. If you want to keep Gargarensia from being torn apart again, it's the only way. ( Chattering, Laughter ) Hector and I talked for hours. Tiber and I did too. You know, he even sang me a song. ( All Laughing ) MEGARA: You should've seen Franco. He's such a beautiful boy. I can't wait to see him again. The both of them. And what about you, Lysia? Did you get to know the man you met? We, uh-- We didn't get round to a lot of talking. ( Women Laughing ) - You returned successful? - Yes, Hera. Did the attack go as planned? Hera, we owe you for everything that we have. Our strength, our freedom. You've brought us such a long way, and we're grateful, but maybe we've gone too far, maybe all men aren't the enemy. I ordered you to kill him! But he doesn't deserve to die! He's different. He's changed. You poor child. Hercules only pretended to change. Everything he did, everything he said... was only to prevent you from sounding the horn. Don't you see? He tricked you! No, that's not true! He-- Do you really think you could change Hercules? He's the son of Zeus. Why, they probably planned all this together. And while he was having his way with you, his men were wrapping their lies around your women. - You've lost control of them. - No! Yes! Now you feel betrayed as I've felt. He was sent to destroy you, and he succeeded. No, you're wrong. I know yo're wrong. He said that-- What? Did he say he loved you? That he needed you? Did he tell you there was no one in the world quite like you? You must act now before everything is gone. Assemble your troops and destroy him. Destroy all of them! Ride into Gargarensia and let no man stand alive! It's the only hope you have of saving what you've worked for, what we've worked for! No, Hera! There'll be no more attacks. Obey me. I'm warning you. We've obeyed you for long enough. We've been controlled by your hate, by the blackness in your heart. Hercules has to die! The Gargarensians have to die! I command you! No! There'll be no more commands! ( Hera Laughing ) ( Laughing Continues ) ( Laughter ) - The women wanted me to thank you. - Thank me? Yeah, look at them. I've never seen them so happy. And to tell you the truth, I'm felling the same way. That's nice. We want to know when we can go back, when we can see the men again. How about right now? Mount up! Full battle gear. Battle arms. We attack Gargarensia again. This time, no man to be left alive. But, Hippolyta, wasn't what happened last night-- You'll obey my orders! Or have you turned against me? No, my queen. Never. Never. We ride immediatley! This time we fight! Move! ( Yelling, Whooping ) ( Yelling Continues ) ( Chicken Clucking ) ( Pig Squealing ) ( Panting, Shouting ) They're coming. They're coming! ( Men Chattering ) ( Sniffs ) ( Horses Whinnying ) ( Yelling Continues ) ( Horses Whinnying ) - Run! - ( Shouting ) ( Shouting Continues ) Aaaaah! ( Screaming ) ( Shouting Continues ) ( Screaming ) Aaaaah! Aaaaah! ( Grunts ) Aaaaaah! ( Horses Whinnying ) Burn everything to the ground! Kill every living soul! Megara! Megara, where are you? It's me. Lysia, kill that man right now! No! HIPPOLYTA: Lysia, kill him! Then I'll kill him myself. I'll kill all of them! Hippolyta! What's going on? What are you doing? I'm saving my women. But they don't need to be saved. Look at them. Their war against these men is over. The war against men is never over, Hercules! With these men it is. You've won. You've got their respect. They're ready to treat you the way you deserve to be treated. And why should we believe your lies? They're not lies! On my love for you, they are not lies. Your father made promises on his love. They didn't last a day. ( Hera's Voice ) They didn't last a day. Hera. ( Laughs ) That's right, Hercules. You may have stolen Hippolyta's heart and her mind, but I-- I control her body. I'm going to enjoy killing you. You and every one of these men! ( Grunting ) Yes! Yes! ( Horse Whinnies ) ( Gasps ) Hercules. There's nowhere to run, Hercules! HERCULES: Hyah! ( Horse Galloping Off ) - Why is he running? - He's trying to save us. But who's gonna save Hercules? ( Horse Whinnies ) If I were you, I'd get back on that horse... and keep on riding. And let Hera control those women? I don't think so. Ohhh! So now they're yours? No, they're not anybody's. They're free to make up their own minds in what they wanna do. If they choose to be with those men, I'm not gonna let Hera stop them. Son, it's best just to get out of her way and head back when it's over. It really works for me. Yeah? It doesn't work for me. I don't suppose I can count on you for any help? Ohh, I'd really love to, but you know how it is. ( Horse Whinnying ) Yeah. I know how it is. HIPPOLYTA: Don't bother hiding, Hercules! I'll hunt you until your head's in my hands! I'm not hiding, Hera. ( Grunting ) You think you're ready for me? Let's see what kind of legend you really are. - I won't fight you. - Come on, Hercules. I know you want to kill me. This is your big chance. No! It's all over, Hera. Those women aren't yours anymore. Hippolyta and all of them, they belong to themselves. No! They belong to me! ( Grunts ) Yes! Yes! ( Grunting Continues ) Hippolyta, you're too strong to be conquered. Listen to me! It won't work, Hercules. She can't fight this battle. Only you can. ( Grunting Continues ) Oh, good. The bleeding has begun. Hippolyta, please. Don't let her do this! If you love me, fight her! Save your breath to scream, Hercules. ( Grunting ) You know, for the champion of men, you were a big disappointment. - No, Pithus! - ( Grunts ) No, Hera! He doesn't have to die! You don't get it, do you? They all have to die. - ( Laughs, Grunts ) - Nooooo! ( Gurgling, Groaning ) ( Grunting Continues ) ( Laughing ) What are you waiting for? Kill me. You know you want to. ( Panting ) No. You can't make me hurt her. ( Birds Chirping ) ( Laughs ) It seems you have no choice now. It's either fight or die. I told you, I won't hurt her. I won't allow both of you to live. Then kill me. What? If one of us has to die, it's gonna be me. ( Laughs ) Who would've thought that of all things... it would be love that kills the great Hercules. I could never stand the pain of living without her. Then live without her. - ( Screams, Laughs ) - No! Nooo! ( Panting ) ( Horse Whinnies ) ( Hercules Panting ) ( Horse Neighs ) Please. ( Horses Whinnying ) Where's my dad? What happened to him? Your father was a good man, Franco. But I want him back! I want kim to be here! Oh, Franco, sometimes we lose the people we love, and there's nothing we can do to bring them back. Don't be so sure. ( Horse Neighs ) ( Sheep Bleating ) ZEUS: Hercules, it's not going to work. What's past is past. Let it go. What you're thinking about is impossible. Wait a second. - Now. Do it. - No. Do it! It's gonna change things. This candle can only show your past. It's not gonna take you back there. That's not the way it works. But you could make it work that way. You do have the power. Yes, I have. But that is not the problem. Son... I love you. And... I understand your pain. But I can't just go around reversing time... and changing the course of events. If you only knew how complicated it gets, with the stars, the planets and all. Not to mention the other gods. I mean, they-- They would go insane if I started messing around with things. Son, you can't imagine th headaches this would cause. You don't understand how important this is. Three lives. Three good people have died. Please, Father. Do this for me. God, have you any idea how angry Hera would be? I couldn't go back home. You never do, anyway. ( Thunder Rumbling ) ( Screaming ) Nooo! No! - ( Gasping ) - They all have to die. ( Shouting ) I'm not afraid of anything. It's a woman! Hercules, I made extra for you. I hope you're hungry. IOLAUS: Hercules, are you all right? Iolaus! It's so damn good to see you! Yeah, you too. Listen, if you don't wanna eat Ania's stew, it's okay. It's all right. I'll eat it. Mmm. This is great. It's the best I've ever had. Iolaus, I know you two are gonna have a long and happy life together. Well, thank you, Hercules. ( Gasps ) Oh, it's-- it's all right. It's only-- It's only Pithus. ( Sniffs ) - It's all right, Pithus. It's me, Hercules. - How do you know my name? It's too long a story. But I know why you're here, and I know how to help you. Then you'll come back with me to Gargarensia. You don't need me. You can solve your problem yourselves. The next time your enemy sttacks, don't treat them as the enemy. Instead of fearing them, respect them. In your hearts, you know who they are. So talk to them. Give them what they want. But we can't do it on our own. You've gotta come back with me. I can't, Pithus. If I go back with you, people will die. Good people. - But then, how do we-- - Just do as I've told you. Make your enemy your friend. In your hearts, you know who they are, so talk to them. Welcome then into your homes, share yourselves... and find out who they are. Take your clothes off. HERCULES: Even if you don't know, try. If you make an effort, it'll change everything. But you have to take the first step. I've written you a love song. More than anything, open yourselves up to them. Show them what matters to you, what you care about. Believe me... it'll put an end to all this hatred. And, uh, it wouldn't hurt... if you washed their feet every once in a while, either. Are you sure it's gonna work? I know it'll work. Keep that for yourself. - What was all that about? - Oh, just an old friend. He needed my help. - Sounds like an adventure. - You're getting married this week. - That's adventure enough for all of us. - ( Laughing ) Now get back over there and help that beautiful woman of yours. Those two belong together, don't they? - They sure do. - And what about you, Hercules? Do you think there's a woman out there who can make you that happy? Yeah. She's out there somewhere.
