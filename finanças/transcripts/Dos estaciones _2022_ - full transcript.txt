Is the fire too low? Okay, that's better. -Everything is here. -It's more than enough for everyone. I work on the land right over there. And there is a really bad plague. Have you seen it here? Yeah, there's some here. That's why we're harvesting this now. But it's also the right age at five years. It's almost ripe, too. So it's old enough to harvest. -Good morning, Juan. -Good morning. -Coffee? -Thanks. You're welcome. Motherfucker. -It doesn't want to start, ma'am? -No, Juan. Can you take care of it? If it starts, give the keys to Rosa, please. Of course. DOS ESTACIONES Good morning! Good morning! Place the sticker upward Juanita, otherwise you will be here all night. Sounds good. -Good morning Cirilo. -Good morning señora María. -Beto, how many have you done? -One palette ma'am. -Is there sufficient fuel? -Yes, we have enough. -We're ready to start it up. -Great, we should let everyone know. -Did they fix the pump? -Yes, it's ready too. -And you saw it working? -Yes I did. -Here comes Pepe. -Good morning Cirilo! -Good morning! -What's up? -How's it going? -All good. -How's it going here? -Excuse me, I'm going. -Go ahead. Cirilo, will you leave the gate open, I'll be coming back this week. I wanted to tell you María that the Fusarium plague is coming back. -And so, I want to come by more often. -Thank you. It's ready! Move the car forward a little, so I can close the doors. Go around and get the paperwork from Cirilo! -Thanks. -You're welcome. Beto. -Thank you. -Welcome. Cirilo. Hello. -How's it going ma'am? -How's Sofi doing? She's recuperating ma'am. Thank you. That's good. Look. I'll make up your salary as soon as I can. It's okay. Don't worry about it ma'am, I understand. Say hello to all the family. Of course, ma'am. I'll see you later. -Rosa! -Yes? Bring me warm tortillas and take these. I'll bring them right away. -Good afternoon ma'am. -Good afternoon Juan. I'm starting my shift. -Good. -Excuse me. Go ahead. Sorry ma'am, could I borrow the plow that's in storage? I'd like to try growing some corn. In storage...oh, yeah take it. -Thank you, ma'am. -Sure. Let me know if it's too tight. Same as always? Yes. Take a spoon or a fork, Gael. Fabián, can you pass me a fork for Gael... Give it to Gael. No Gael, don't play with your food. Ah, María is here. Hot dog! Good afternoon. Hi ma'am. It's great that you could make it. Hi Rosa, here is the gift. -Thank you, Rosa. -You can put that on the table. There's a seat for you here. -Do you want something to drink? -Yeah, you know... -Tequila? -Yes, please. One tequila for Señora María, please. -Are you hungry? Can I bring you food? -The tequila first, please. -Thank you. -Of course. -Hello. -Hi. Are there any more plates? They're gone. Who didn't get a piece of cake? Me! Do you want some also? I'll serve you. Wait! Wait! Ok, ok, ok! Everyone sing to her! Go! Go! Do not lose the target because if you lose it, you'll lose your way! -Can I sit? -Of course. -How's the party going for you? -Too many children, no? Obviously... Is it tequila? -Do you want some? -Yes. Flaco! No! Pour it in one like mine. Yes, ma'am. -It doesn't taste the same. -I bet. Thank you. Alright, cheers! Wow, it's really tasty. I can taste the barrel. -You know? -Of course. I worked for more than ten years in a tequila factory. There were layoffs and I got the bad news. And I moved here; I haven't been here for too long. What did you do? So many things... Where do I begin? Well, look... I oversaw the warehouse, I did inventory, I helped my boss manage employees. I handled payroll. You see, a little bit of everything. I helped my boss with tequila inventories. I handled merchandise entering and leaving the factory. Many things... I also oversaw government regulations. You must know that's a challenge. Sometimes I even managed the janitors... And even fed the horse! Why not? A little bit of everything. You must've charged a lot of money for all of that. Only what was fair. Yeah... You know. Do you also cook? Not really. I'm joking. I almost fell for it. I'm actually looking for someone with your profile. Yeah? Señora María! Oh, I see... -Wait a second. -Of course. You tell me... I can't promise you anything, but come by the factory tomorrow. Really? Just tell me what time and I will be there. -Come in the afternoon. -Alright. I won't be late. Señora María, will you take a photo with us? -It was nice to meet you. -But it's a family photo Rosa. You are part of the family. Cousin, get over here! -Me too? -Yes! Yamis, come! -Do I leave my hat on? -However you like! Come here, next to María. Hey, Mauricio you're blocking me. Get a little bit closer. Gael, look at the camera, honey. One, two... Hey, smile a little bit! Cheese! And here are my ovens. Two on this side. -Can I go in? -Yeah, just be careful. The four of them are made of clay. They're quite spacious. They're big... The agave pines arrive there and then go to the grinding belt. Five mills and the chopping machine. And here are the tanks for juices and nectar. We produce our own yeast. Oh, yeah? My yeast is preserved in the National Polytechnic Institute... My mother yeast. -No way! Really? -Yes. Wow, that must cost you a good chunk of money. It's worth it. Then, from the twenty-liter tank it goes to the three hundred one... and then flows down to these of three thousand. Yeah. And here's where it's mixed together... ...of juices, nectar and yeast. -That's what they call mosto. You know? -Yes, I know. Our fermentation begins here. Look, here's where they should put the final product. And here all the materials. Like it should be. And there put the empty boxes and caps. Because it looks a mess. -Look at where the boxes and caps are. -Exactly. That's why I need someone with your profile. To help me. Those details really matter. They really do. But you know there's a serious agave crisis right now. Yes. But this factory is projected to expand, we're going to do really well. It's just that right now I can't pay you a full salary. -But I could give you housing and food. -Seriously? Well, if it's not too much to ask for, I'd be grateful. Not at all, we'll help each other! Look... Where? Oh, yes. They're here. These are the bank statements for the year. Look. Check them. And know what? You're going to come with me on Saturday when I pay the workers. So, they can meet you. Ok. Eventually you can do it on your own. Look. This is my list of agave farmers. The ones with the asterisks... It's urgent for you to call them. Ok. Because it's urgent to buy agave from them. -Yes? -Yeah, I will. This one especially, I have dealt with him for months. And I don't know why he won't answer my calls now. Insist. This one, right? -Yeah, that one. -Right. You said this is urgent right? What? -The agave. -Obviously. I have a relative that does that for a living. What's his name? His name is Eduardo Fuentes but they call him Lalo. I don't know him. He's been doing it for years. And he really... He gets really good quality agaves at respectable prices. You see how people are stealing agave now. And the foreign factories are buying everything up. If you want, I'll give you his contact. I'm interested, but you speak with him first. You know him better. Okay, I'll try to reach him tomorrow. Talk to me before you agree on anything. Price, anything... you let me know. -Okay. -Yes? Yeah, that sounds good. Tomorrow I'll keep you posted. You can count on it. Are you on a diet? No. You're very skinny. I've always been this way. It's a compliment. Thanks. Fucking Americans. Ma'am, I'd like to introduce you to Lalo. Can you come for a second? Let's go. Cirilo! -Tell me ma'am -This is Lalo. -How are you? -Nice to meet you. -Cirilo is my right-hand man. -Good to know. What'd you think of the size and sugar levels? It's quite good. Sugar levels are at 25, which is very good. The second truck will arrive shortly. -It's from the same plot I assume? -Yes, of course. -Very good. -Same land, yeah. I'm taking you to a place where hot water comes from the ground. Volcanic. It boils so much that people put their chickens and hens there. -Alive? -No! Dead so they can de-feather them. So that's why the town is named this way. Yes. Oh, they're setting up fireworks. My village is bigger and they don't have fireworks castles like this. -What's the name of your village? -La Palma. Smile! For memory's sake... You don't like my new truck? I'm messing with you. I borrowed it. Really? I thought you were being serious. And now I'm only going to blend this section with your layers. So we don't see layers and your bangs connect organically with your hair. Because if we don't connect it you'll feel this separation too violently. This section looks great. You having straight hair helps a lot. I do have very straight hair. -Look at this... -Wow, even my face looks different. You're so fast... What do you think? You like it? -I love it. -It's a very comfortable length. Yes... Brush yourself off because you have a bit too much blush. -Look. -You see? -It's pretty, no? -Yeah, I do like it. I like it a lot. You're going to put your hair up in a half ponytail? Yes. And some flowing locks below... or straight. How do you like it best? The flowing locks... I like them. -The ends? -The ends curled a little. Great. Excuse me. In the past we used coins. -Could you help me? -Okay. Of course. You have to put the card in there. -Like this? -Yeah. I think you need to take it out and put it back in. So you've never played with a card before? No, it's my first time. Let's try again, it didn't recognize it. There you go. Now all you have to do is choose the game you want to play. You can pick one of these or look for other games. Use the arrows. -That one was nice. -Yeah? -I won. -Yes. -Here? -No, that sign right there tells you. What's your name? Tatis. -And you? -Fernando. Very nice. Look, they are almost in a row. Ah, that's good. Hey mom. -No luck over there? -Nope, I'm going to try this one again. How long ago did your dad pass? It's been eight years. Since he died... It's been a long time. Although it still feels like it was yesterday. -Yeah, it's not easy. -No, no it's not. More so when it happens suddenly. When you expect it, and there's no visible sickness. Not that it makes it easy to know ahead of time. But everything happened that way, so sudden. That's life. I painted different landscapes of the town and of my village. -You didn't tell me you painted. -Oh, I hadn't told you? Yeah, I like to paint. I actually did it when I was young but then stopped. But I've always loved painting. Especially nature. -Of course. -Landscape painting. It's very beautiful. I also use colors when I do makeup... because I'm a make-up artist. It's such an art to utilize color combinations, shades and tones. It's beautiful. -They call that hill the Sleeping Lady. -Really? Yeah, if you look closely you can see her shape. Like if someone had carved her features. Of course. -Her nose, her lips. -Yes exactly! Have you been dying hair for a long time? Yeah, many years. -I see. -It's been a while. Have you done anything to your hair? Only once... about a year ago. What'd you do? I had it bleached... I think that's what they call it. Like partial highlights from the roots? No, more like California style. From the chin down. Oh, gotcha. That's cool. Well your hair is pretty thin, so I think it was damaged a little bit. -Is your hair long? -Not really. That's why I haven't touched it since. I'm letting it grow out. Still, it'd be nice if you tried something. -Because you can't really see... -Look, I'll show you. You can't see the color. Look. -Oh, this is nice. -It's nearly out, right? Yes, in fact, you can see it only on the tips. It's almost gone. Well, you should really do something to it; it could look really nice. Again, it's almost gone... So maybe we could use a color that will make your face shine. Like a caramel tone. That would look really cool. As long as it makes you feel comfortable, of course. -Tatín, I'm ready! -Yes, I'm coming. Let me see when I can go to your salon. Yes! Of course. How's it going with the salon? It's going really well. I have lots of clients right now. It's going great. Actually, I wanted to tell you that I'm going to remodel it. To make it prettier and more spacious. Why are you telling me this? I already told you that it's yours. Thank you. In fact, my mom and I are very grateful for all the help you've given us. With what money are you going to remodel? Well, I'm going to use my savings and I'm looking at a loan. Go to Rafa. For what? So that she can see how we can help you. No, I'm going to do it myself. It comes from the well I mentioned earlier. -The one we just passed? -Yes. We used to play there when I was a kid. When I was little I used to walk all the way from here to there. All the way down there? -Do you see that strip of big trees? -Yes. -There is a river beneath them. -Really? -I used to bathe there. -Wow. It must be beautiful at this time of year. Yes. It's not what it used to be though... -I can imagine. -People can be quite dirty, suddenly. -What are those tiny balls, by the way? -Coffee. Oh, it's coffee?! I didn't know how it looked. It's very rare that they grow in these temperatures. But, I'm telling you, this land is really fertile. Pepe, helped me with it. You met Pepe, right? Yes. Pepe helped me by bringing somebody... an agricultural engineer. We did an experiment and it worked. All because these trees provide shade. Were you the one who built everything and planted all the trees? My father started it. But I've expanded it. That wasn't even a shadow of what I've built. The pesticide didn't work, right? No María, it's not showing results. I tried two insecticides and nothing. They're sick and I'm worried because... It looks like it's the same plague that hit the Ramirez's last year. That was all lies. Lies? It almost wiped out their entire field, María. I'm sure it was jimadores who stole that agave. Ma'am? I was revising the accounts and I saw that you have a lot of debts. Look... I organized them from biggest debts to smallest. I think that with the tequila that we have in stock... ...we could cover the small debts. -What do you think? -Yes, it's fine. Also, I noticed you had some very good offers to sell the factory. Do you want me to evaluate them further? No. You could pay the larger debts in full if you sold. I said no. Take care of this. I want to thank you for all these years that you gave me a job and for all your help. It pains me because I feel a part of the family... of your company. But I have to go, ma'am. It's a done deal? Yes, ma'am. I would've liked for you to tell me earlier. It's because everything happened so fast, ma'am. When do you start? Next week. Where? Oh, sorry. -Sorry for what? -I was just looking for a mug. -Are you going out or what? -No, I just came in. The cups are there. Do you know how to dance? More or less. Let's see. I'll lead. Yeah, you know. Just a little. Where did you learn? Just looking. Rosa! Rosa! The factory can't operate at this time. You can all go rest. Rafa will call you when we're ready to begin working again. So, you'll let us know? -Okay, thank you. -Bye. Do you know what you're going to do? No. That was "Recordar es vivir" from the quartet Legado Norteño.
