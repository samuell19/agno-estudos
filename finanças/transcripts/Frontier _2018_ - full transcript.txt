THE RUSSIAN CINEMA FUND Central Partnership KIT Film Studio IVAN Production Victor's on our case today. Sixteen missed calls. He's gonna have us murdered for this shit! Look at all this, Alex. All this beauty. You and I made it happen... Mikhail, stop getting on my nerves. Huh? Stop panicking. We're gods, bro. By the way, you stink. Of fear. Your stupid attempts at humor aren't gonna work with Victor or with the goddamned diggers. Yeah, we don't want to draw public attention to the quarry. If they shut us down we'll be in whole lot of trouble. Damnit, we already are Mikhail! We should plan a freak accident for the diggers. What do you mean, a "freak accident"? Well, usually freak accidents are accidental and cause injuries. Eighteen calls. Hey, hey, hey! Young lady, please stop this. Get out of the way. And you, stop filming me. - Good afternoon, Mikhail. - Hey. - Are there only two of them? - Yeah, those two. The guy is doing a live online broadcast. Here's public attention for you. The little bitch is hot. Anyway, we'll deal with them. Yeah. But... but... a freak accident? But that's... Are we not clear? Maybe I should find you a replacement... No, no need... Keep an eye on me, I'll adjust my hair, and then... Got it? Got it. - Well, go then. - Yes, sir. We're pulling back all the vehicles! Pull back! - Pull back. - Back where? Just do what I said! Move it.. Apologies, I didn't bring a ring or a funeral band with me. Your suit looks expensive, don't ruin it. Hey well, it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make. With a stunner like you next to me I'd rather be horizontal. Are you hitting on me already? Just like that? Why wait? You like me right? I do. I know it goes against the laws of propriety, but... Yes, I find you attractive. Well then... Let's go to my place. Why waste time? Bye, students. End of the broadcast. Your shirts, the woman who irons them doesn't put her heart into it. There's no love in your life. Love is weakness. You don't know what love is, Mikhail Shurov. That's your name, isn't it? What do you want? To suspend the works until we've finished the excavation and identified all the remains. Stop here! Cut the engine! Alright. Take a break, have a walk or something. Go, go, get out of here. You can't bring the dead back to life. Let's maybe put up an obelisk here? They get commemoration, you get karma points, I get the sand. I'll finance it through you. Are you trying to bribe me or them? Don't be difficult so damn difficult. I'm trying to find a solution to the problem. I doubt you want to sit here forever. Guarding fallen heroes. I do like you, Shurov, but you think like everyone else. Lord have mercy on me. I want to show you something. 200,000 soldiers died here, trying to break the Siege. Yeah, but why is this so important to you? As they say, you'll understand when you're older. Some things are hard to explain. Fine, but can you at least try to explain it to me? Give it a try. Come with me. When the Nazis seized the area, the last defenders of the Neva Bridgehead gathered here. They all committed suicide, choosing death over capture. Hold this for me please. Among them, there was a young woman. Next to her remains we found a bottle of Red Moscow perfume. Take a sniff. The fragrance is still alive. Major Grachyov shot himself with this tiny pistol, choosing it over his TT-30. He left a note behind for his sweetheart. She was a nurse here, survived the war and died in the 1990s. Faithful to his memory, she never got married. Pity, no women like that now. Well, maybe a few. We have something here that might interest you. I would say it's kind of... a riddle from the past. A riddle? They were under the leadership of a senior battalion commissar. His name was Alexey Shurov. So is that your riddle? Cool story. Now I'll fall to my knees, repent and stop the works - is that the plan? Tough luck, Cutie Shrew. My dad is from an orphanage. His last name was assigned there. So you see, I have nothing to do with any of this. - You need to know that for sure. - How come? What difference will it make? Look, those people died so we could live. Right? The dead shouldn't create problems for the living. Do you realize what this means? For now, only what I can see. The ice broke up. "The ice broke up"? We're stranded now! Stuck between the Krauts and the melting Neva! You know it better than I do. That's it. This is the end. Say that again and I'll shoot you. I'm no coward, it's not about me. What will I say to the men? They're barely holding on as it is. You'll say to the men... ...that victory will be ours. Without a single doubt. Now go back to your troops, at once. What's going on here? Hey man, what's going on here? Where am I? Are you deaf or something? Hey? Man? This is nuts. So, I pulled this metal thing out of the wood... I saw you on the river bank. Wait! Lieutenant, how many men do you have left? Can you counter attack? Am I invisible or something? Hey! Can anybody see me? The man has fought his share. Good heavens... Can you see me? Can you see me? Am I dead? I need ammo! Got any grenades? Who's got any grenades? Blow up the tank. I was inside the dugout. I pulled out this cramp iron, and... You do it. The cramp iron... I think I figured out your riddle, Cutie Shrew. I have the key. Now I need the lock. Ah, I need to find the dugout. How old are you, son? I'm eighteen, Comrade Senior Battalion Commissar. Commissar? Remember me sir? Hang on. Commissar. That's right, you're Commissar Shurov. She showed me your ID. Our unit crossed the Neva under your command. You told us, "There's no ammo or food, only vodka to keep warm". I remember. A unit of 400 men from Tsarskoye Selo. Yes, sir. - How many survivors? - Yesterday there were ten. And now on this bridgehead, you and I son are equals. Here, I'll throw it with my left hand. Wait. Hey, where are you going? You have to take me to the dugout! I'll get killed here! You're the man. Oh, he's alive. Why do I even worry? He's going to shoot himself in the dugout. Don't give in, soldiers. Keep your spirits up. Comrade Commissar, will they send reinforcements? We're getting massacred here. Leave it... Sing something instead. (singing in foreign language) Grachyov, gather all the women and get them ready to evacuate. Sir, what about the wounded? Found the dugout. Thanks everyone, and goodbye. This is our last chance to save the girls, including your Olga. They attacked, but we fought them off, but they keep coming from all directions. I have the key, but where's the lock? Heavy casualties, yes. We lost more than half of our remaining troops. People are exhausted, and... No, nobody's panicking yet... Where's the damn lock? What I'm saying is... Yes, sir. Understood. Was it here? Or maybe over here? Did you ask for reinforcements? - Think they'll send any our way? - I wouldn't. What's the plan then? The Krauts will try to push us into the Neva. We'll resist until the last man. Come on, damn it! Come on. We must save the girls before it's too late. At least them. I gave an order to take them to the right bank. - Ready to go? - Not yet? Hurry up, double time! Boris! My dear... My love... Here, take this. Use it to defend yourself. Olga darling, this isn't a weapon. I can only throw it at the Krauts, or shoot myself with it. It's the tiny pistol from the dugout. Not sure I want to see him use it. I will wait for you Boris. Olga, you have to realize, anything can happen and we just... Don't say that. I'll wait for you until we meet again. I can't go without you. I love you. Grachyov, enough romancing! Bring her to the boat! Now! - No, not without you. - You can. You have to. Now go. - Goodbye, boys! - So long, take care! - We'll see you soon. - Stay alive! Come on girls, stroke! Everything will be fine. Keep rowing, girls! Keep going. Look, girls - a flare! They saw the boat is full of women. At least there's something human left in them. Don't bet on it. Their humanity lets them keep hundreds of thousands of women and children starving in Leningrad. This is it, the 2nd battalion is cut off. The commander stayed in the control room. His legs are shattered. We can't get him out of there, the bastards secured the area. As senior ranking officer, I will take command. From now on, the control room is in my dugout. So it's a different dugout, old man? Thank God. I thought I'd croak here. This is a maze in hell. Where's the dugout? Commissar! This is not him. They're here, take cover! There you are. I thought I've lost you. There wasn't any pain before... Doctor, he opened his eyes. Lie still, don't move. Nurse, prepare a saline drip. You'll pay for this, scumbag. Wait, don't get up. Mikhail, are you feeling alright? Why did you stay behind? I couldn't leave the wounded, Comrade Senior Battalion Commissar. Hold on, I'll dress your wounds. We're surrounded. They'll be here in minutes. This is the end. Any objections? Is that it? Goodbye, Mother... ...not working... the battalion... casualties... comrades... How do I get out of here? Commissar? How? Commissar, is there an escape? There is no escape. Commissar! Mikhail, thank God you're alive. I was worried sick. Are you alright? - Was I here the whole time? - Right here, yes. The guys and I were nearby when the dugout collapsed. We pulled you out right away, before the ambulance arrived. - Are you nauseous? Dizzy? - I'm fine, except for my shoulder. Why would he be nauseous? A little sand fell on him. I'm fine. To be honest, when the dugout collapsed, we nearly crapped ourselves. Please sign here that you refuse hospitalization. Here, here. Let me help you up... There you go. We're back on track. - Panaitov, what time is it? - Let me see... It's ten past two. Is your watch not working? Piece of Swiss crap... Where's Cutie Shrew? They took her away. She wasn't wearing a hard hat and got hit in the head with a log... Kaboom! - How come? - A freak accident, just like you wanted. When you touched her hair I released the brake pedal. I made sure nobody saw me do it. So it was you? I told you I would touch my own hair, not hers. Victor, don;t worry we'll have the money in a week's time, dead cert. "Dead cert", "dead meat", "dead broke"... Stop using stupid jargon, Alex. You're a son of a general. Yeah. Why did you even go into this business? It's obviously not your thing. Let me clarify something. Working with you is as much pleasure as... ...as eating this dish. Eat. Does it taste good? Victor, I'm sorry we signed two more contracts for supply of sand. We'll pay you as soon as we can. I think... ...this dish is not spicy enough. Mikhail, excuse me, bon appetit... Can we speak for a moment? - Oh, I'm sorry... - Watch yourself! Your Shrew is in intensive care at the Research Institute of Emergency Medicine. Panaitov, you're going to jail. If I am, you're going there with me. I'm the perpetrator, but you, Mikhail, are the mastermind. Chew your food thoroughly, Alex. There's no need to rush things, don't you agree? Everyone thinks it was an accident. Let it stay that way. Listen, I don't even remember the directions you gave me. You should forget them too, especially after a fainting spell. It's like amnesia. - I see them. - See who? Those whose remains were found in the quarry. You mean, dead people? They look alive and real. I'd much rather see the Maldives in front of me. Mikhail, I'm getting worried for you. Your visions could be symptoms of a brain hematoma, if not worse... - Panaitov, do you like solving riddles? - Riddles? Well... Next time he's gonna bury us alive. I know, but I really have to go now. Mikhail... Mikhail! Those flowers are expensive. Yeah well, anything for the woman I love. No offense, student, but you have no chance. Trust my experience on this, don't waste your cash. They won't let you see her you know. I can pass yours on to her. Don't piss me off. You should sit down, dear. Come, come. - Hi. - Hello. Hi, Sergey. It's good to see you. Thank you for coming again. Everything's will be fine. - Excuse me... sorry who are you? - No one important. Should I introduce you? I'm nobody. I was at the quarry. I wanted to express my sympathy. Thanks, but she can't have any visitors. She's in a coma. Only doctors are allowed inside. Hey there, I brought you flowers, Cutie Shrew. Here ya go. Forgive me for what happened. It was caused by human error. But it's nothing compared to your riddles. The visuals are insane. I'd rather be in a coma than see those horrors. I wish I hadn't met you. Who is he, who let him in? If I'd run you over with a truck my life would be easier. Should I call security? It's fine I'm leaving, get your hands off me! Get out of here, and don't come back. Easy, I'll introduce myself. I'm your future son-in-law Mikhail. These are for you. Take care of them. Miss! Excuse me... I'm looking for my father. - His name? - Shurov, Nikolai. - He's down on the beach. - Thanks. Have a talk with him. He doesn't observe our regime and walk schedule. He has quite a temper. Are you new here? I haven't seen you before. - I've been working here for two years. - Oh yes? Listen, I pay you enough to deal with his temper. He "pays me money"... - Why'd you come? - I wanted to check on you. What for? They'll let you know when I finally kick the bucket. So, Dad, have you ever met any of the Shurovs? Why do you ask? - Just curious. - Nothing to be curious about. Nobody needed me, so they put me in the orphanage and that was it. They might've died in the war. Exactly, there was a war on. Why would anyone decide to make a baby in 1943? What other destiny could I've had? Did the orphanage have any records of the Shurovs? Listen, forget about the Shurovs. There were no Shurovs. Auntie Shura, a nurse in the orphanage, took care of me - that's how I got my last name. We don't have any relatives, and we don't need any. Hey, come here. Come here. - Why? - Look me in the eye. Remember: love is weakness. Dependence. Love yourself, son, and nobody else. Don't be a fool. Lunchtime! Nikolai! Let's go. "ORPHANAGE" Damn it... Can I help you? The orphanage has moved. The building is in bad condition. Now we're moving the archive. Nope, nothing under "Shurov". I know, I'll try "Churov". Names get misspelled sometimes. "Nikolai SHUROV" - What about a stack of case files? - Let's prop up the cabinet with it. Tomorrow we'll get the broken leg fixed, and put the files back. That'll do for now. "Air alert!" Auntie Shura, get the children. - Are you alright sir? - Umm... Yes. I found a statement on Nikolai Shurov, says his file's been lost. Somebody looked for it in 1962, and didn't find it. Right... - I need scissors. - One moment. Help me, tilt this. - Is this it? - Yes. "Father: Shurov, born 1927 Mother: Elena Hohotova, born 1927" I have the proof. I know for sure, I'm not... I'm not related to your Commissar. See? I have the proof. My grandfather was born in 1927. Persistent. Yes, such is my nature. You know where the door is. Make her recover quickly. Here's the down payment. Keep the money. - What, principles? - Honesty. The truth is, we don't know how comas work. Some come back from it, others don't, but trust me, money's not the answer. I see. Here's a piece of free advice: People come back from a coma if they're missed, needed and loved. That's something money can't buy. Thank you. Don't come here again. If you ever dare lay a hand on me again I will break your arm. Let go of me! You little punk, you listen to me good. I don't care what your riddles are - shamanism, hypnosis, or NLP... Let go! It hurts! There's no way in hell you can make me stop the works! So get over it! It's done, I got news for you. That Commissar Shurov of yours is not related to me in any way shape or form. I saw my dad's case file. In 43', my grandfather was 16, and that guy was above 40! See? Speaking of age, Commissar Shurov had two sons. - How do you know? - We found his letters down there. I can send you the scans. There's an address. They might have living relatives. "11, Razyezzhaya Street, Apt. 15" "11, Razyezzhaya Street" Stop this! Leave me alone! Commissar, it's you again? Stop haunting me! You're all dead now. What do you want from me? You're dead and gone. Let others have a life! Your time's over! One, two, three... Kick it higher! Higher! One, two... Valya, go home now! Your father will hear about this! - Where's the ball? - You kicked it last. No, you did. Go see a doctor, idiot! I see no abnormalities. These swirly lines are most likely scanner glitches. But we can repeat the examination if you like. Yeah? Every one of you should be shot! I'm on my way. Get a full health check. These days Doc, I don't even have time for a full meal. Don't you get it? Tens of thousands of our dead soldiers lie here! Think of your grandfathers! Theys could be among them! Stop the works! I'm asking you! Stop the works! Please I beg you! We'll lose time, we'll just have to make it up. Just, let us give them a proper burial. I'm asking you nicely. Stop the works. What's so precious about those bones? All of those sacrifices were meaningless, pointless deaths. Nobody cared about them. Guess what? We found another Shurov. Here's his ID tag. Take it. Be careful, the paper is fragile. Pavel Shurov. No way in hell! Back here again? Why do I keep grabbing things with my hands! The cramp iron, and now this ID tag... I found the commissar, and now I need to find Pavel? Pavel... Ah, and I need to be there when he gets killed. Of course. Oh wow, thousands... Shurov! Pavel! Shurov! Pavel! Pavel! Shurov! Shurov! ...the fate of our dear city, Leningrad, and our fate, my brothers-in-arms! I need to focus. He can't be far away. Like last time, he should be near me. Like right, where did I pop up here? I was... somewhere around here. Hey, student... Some advice, stop fidgeting. You could get court-martialed for that. Who said that? Shurov? Cut out all the talking! ...Death to fascist invaders! We must break the enemy's siege and reopen land communications with Leningrad! Soldiers, onwards! - Get me the troop commanders. - Yes, sir. So, which one of you is Shurov? - Where do you study? - At the Conservatory. I play violin. Same here, but I study piano. No way! We'll have live music in battle! I'm from the Polytech. I need your names guys! So how'd you lose your tooth, Polytech? I was asking too many questions, like you are now. Port side, put your backs into it. Stroke. Stroke. Stroke. Starboard, keep up. Stroke. Stroke. Stroke. Stroke. Keep up the rhythm. Stroke. Stroke. Stroke. Stroke. Stroke. Am I... wounded? You can't drown if you're destined to burn! Come on, brothers! Stroke! Don't stop! Keep rowing! Go on! Stroke! Don't stop rowing! Throw the dead overboard! Keep rowing! Don't stop man! Bastards... I said, keep rowing! - Using what? - A helmet if you have to! - Bastards! - Shut it, keep rowing everyone! Don't stop! Polytech! - Polytech! - My name's Pavel! And so we meet, Pavel. - Hey I'm Pavel too! - Thank you. There's two of you? Move it! Grab the ammo! Lock and load! Into the dugouts! Hurry! Move! Move it! Hurry! Hurry! This way! Disperse, disperse! Move in short dashes! Come on, follow me! Wait for me! I have to be next to you when you get killed! - What do we do now? - Where's the frontline? There's our troop commander. We must follow him. Come on, Alex, let's go! Wait, Pavels! You'll get shot! I need to be there when the portal opens. Damn it... Polytech! Wait! Get back here! This is the frontline. If you die now, who's going to fight the Krauts? Are you students? Welcome to the Neva Bridgehead bookworms. - Where's Polytech? - I'm not sure. Where is he? He followed after the troop commander, and then a bomb exploded there. Think he survived? Gone then, without me. Toothless brat. You'd better be Shurov, or I'm done for. This is no opera house. There'll be no intermission. You'll have to grow up real fast. I brought them from home thinking it might be useful. That's silly. We're in a different theater, theater of war. My mom's gonna kill me. She loves ballet... Pavel, if I die, could you return these to her? Are you stupid? Don't even think it. You'll return it to her yourself. Still, I'll write down the address... - Get away from me! - You'll jinx us! God damnit! Let him write that damn note. What are you writing, huh? Death ain't bad luck. "Efimov." Ah, new recruits? Very good. You, and you two. Comrades, after dark I need you to go out scouting and capture a prisoner for interrogation. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. Very well then. Keep your head low! I think my dancing days are over. Alex? Lie down and stay still! Stop moving! Alex? Hey, get up. Alex, come on. We gotta go. The base. Alex? Get to the base. You hear me, soldier? It's an order. If you want to live, go now. I'll stay here with him. We'll be just fine. I promised to return it to his mother... I won't leave you here. Just leave me here... It hurts like hell. He's lost too much blood. Unfortunately, I can't help. He has two, maybe three hours left. What can you do? Nothing. The hospital is on the right bank. I can take him. Bad idea, soldier. Comrade Lieutenant! The ice isn't strong enough to walk on. Are we just going to let him die? Get back before dawn. Otherwise they'll call you a deserter. Wait for me, pianist. Don't die where I can't see you. I have zero desire to get stuck here. - Help me get him to the hospital. - One, two, three, pull! - We'll deal with him. How bout you, wounded? - Not apart from a scratch. What do you mean a scratch? You need to go to the hospital too. You're covered in blood. You're a hero. I couldn't have done that. Come on, friend. Hang on, we got ya. Hey, bookworm. You're a real man. Thank you. What's your name? You know me, Uncle Vladimir. We live in the same building. I'm Pavel, Pavel Shurov. Sorry, Pavel, I didn't recognize you. Thank you, Pavel. Thank you. You'll live. I'm off. You need rest, you should stay here. I know I can't stop you. I'm off... ...to die. And, lift! I tried to tell you, you got the wrong place. There you are, Polytech. Pasha! Pavel... Please... Can you see me? Can you see me? Here Pavel, take this. It's your tag. Take it. Here. Return the binoculars. I promised... Mikhail, are you alright? Can you hear me ok? Anything hurt? Need a doctor? - Should I call the ambulance? - Mikhail, can you hear me? Hey? - Where's the binoculars? - The binoculars? There should have been a pair of theater binoculars. Where are they? How did you know? May I? Put it here. I need to return it. Stop the works. - Are you sure? Stop them? - Temporarily. - I must figure something out first. - Figure out what? The Shurovs. Excuse me, is this the Efimov residence? - You have the wrong address. - They lived here before. Before? Yes, during the war. Wait... My grandmother's maiden name was Efimova. (children playing) This way, please. Boys, settle down already! You should be in your beds by now! There are six of us, so each gets a small piece of bread. Just like this. First, we'll boil the carpenter's glue down until it fully dissolves. Then we'll pour it into plates. When it cools down it's ready to eat. It tastes as good as jelly. Auntie Masha, your Alexey is here. Mom, I'm going, to avenge dad and my brother. What to war? You're only sixteen. I said I was seventeen. Are you stupid? What's gotten into your head, Alexey? You're my only son now, my baby! They're waiting for me downstairs. I said I'll be back in two minutes. We don't have time to talk about this. Alexey, don't do this to me. Mom, I have to go. I'm sorry. Let go, Mom please! What are you doing? As senior ranking officer, I command you to stay! He was a very promising violinist. You can't even imagine how much this means to me. I can never repay you, I'm overwhelmed. So, those were the Shurovs. Sorry, what did you say? In this apartment, the young Alexey said goodbye to his mother. You all ate carpenters' glue, said it was like jelly. The siege. Do you remember? - Wait, carpenters' glue. - Exactly. Auntie Masha used to bring that for us. We were friends with the Shurovs. They were our neighbors. Auntie Masha was an army doctor. She saved us all from starvation. One sec. Their building didn't survive the war. Later, Auntie Masha also went to war. She died during the breach of the siege. What happened to young Alexey? He didn't make it. He never even knew he had a son. A son? - Are you alright? Water? Sweetheart... - I'll get some. Here, sit, sit, sit. How do you know about the son? Well for a while there, we were getting their mail. Alexey's fiance wrote him letters. In one of them, she wrote that he became a father. You know, sometimes I think, if he'd known about the son he would've come back home. Because when you have kids, people to take care of, you don't risk your life. Can I have a look at that, the letter? Pardon me for asking, but are you related to them? Grandson. Mishka! Wait, wait a second. We need to talk. We've known each other for years, haven't we? We're like brothers. Yeah, I just want to say... I'm sick of the ups and downs. I, I don't want to do this. I'm sorry. What's that? A non-lethal. But it'll kill you point blank. Come one, are you crazy? No no, no you're crazy. We owe Victor 10 million for the quarry. Our clients need the sand. They'll claim a forfeit. We have sand up to our eyeballs, but you decide to stop the work and for what? Just for those archaeologists, so they can dig around? Calm down and put the gun away. No. We're going to the quarry, and you'll order them to resume work. I need to deliver a letter. A letter? What are you a goddamned mailman now? Come this way. Get in. Get in, or I'll shoot you full of bullets. What an idiot. A plush gangster. "Come urgently. They're disconnecting her from life support." Shit! Shit, shit, shit... Prepare adrenaline. - Elena, adrenaline. - I'm on it. - We have cardiac arrest. - Continue resuscitation. Tell them to prep the operation room. - Sveta... - Go, go, go. Prep the defibrillator. Hurry up! Sweetie, I'm so happy. Thank you so much! Stand clear. - Do it. - Ready. Shock. ...so happy. Thank you, Doctor. - Ready. - Do it. Shock. I feel sorry for him. Looks like he's going to die. We nearly lost our girl because of him. Still, I feel sorry for him. - Stand clear. Shock. - Do it. Still no word from any relatives. No one even came to check on him. Ready. Shock. ...his chances are near zero. Did he have to climb into that dugout? - Doctor, stand clear. - Do it. Shock. Mikhail Shurov, what kind of life did you lead? You have nobody... If nothing happens in the next 15 minutes, we'll certify death. - Ready. - Do it. Shock. Stop, stop! I need to deliver the letter first... Wait, wait... It worked. Get up, buddy. Alexey? Alexey, wait for me! Alexey, hold up I'm here! Hot blood. Very hot. ...The Krauts are mostly at the entrance. Our objective is simple. First, bombard them with grenades and then make our way up to the roof. You got all that? Let's go, boys. Wait for me! Recon incoming, the Krauts! Turn your head to the right, Alexey. Krauts are here! I'll hold them back, and you boys this is your chance. Get up to the roof. You've got to. People need a sign. If our soldiers see a red flag, they'll know we're winning. And the Krauts will surrender quicker. We gotta find cover! - Any grenades left? - I'm all out. I got nothing, not even ammo. Here, catch. Grenade! If we stay here like this, they're just going to blow us to pieces. We'll have to split up then: one on the right, one on the left, one in the center. We'll do a swoop attack. Take them by surprise we'll have a better chance! Let's do it! On three boys. One... Two... Three! Gramps, you're super cool. I'm so proud of you. Gramps, this is for you. Hurrah! Hurrah! Gramps... Who are you? You're awesome. Who are you? Gramps, you have to come back home alive. Please. Someone's waiting. Welcome back, Mikhail my boy. Thank you, Doc. Don't thank me. Thank those who waited for you. Was it you who waited? Yup. Any objections? I need to call my father. He's here. He fell asleep. What's your name, Cutie Shrew? Lisa. Elizaveta Tikhonova. Elizaveta Tikhonova, I love you. Mishka. You're back. Sonny... Hey there. (music playing)
