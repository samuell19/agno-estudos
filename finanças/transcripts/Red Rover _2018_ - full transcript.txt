Looking at this geological model, the sheared host rock sequences were observed with significant high grades. Unfortunately, these occur in spots of extremely delicate fractures and fissures. In short, while the nature of this deposit does have the potential for great bearings, it should be noted that it also shows a high level of inaccessibility. I detailed the numbers on page 150. Tell you what. I'm just gonna pitch this fucker myself. But you... you didn't even read the report. No, I got the gist. The gist? Inaccessibility? Really? Potential. Hey, potential is the only fuckin' word in this document that matters. It's a big risk, we get it, but think about the potential returns. Okay, but I could... I mean, I think I should come with you and... No, no, no. In fact, you just hang back here and I'll give you a buzz if I need to throw some more geology numbers at them. Right? Don't you want the report? I can't sell bad news. Hey man, it's not a big deal, but today is garbage day, not recycling. That's three weeks in a row and it's just gonna pile up again. "Conversations that don't matter take away from conversations that can matter." That's Rumi. Yeah, that's definitely not Rumi. Pretty sure it's Rumi, mate. I'll loan you one of his books. I got a couple up in our bedroom. How's the job hunt going? Mate, you really... ...need to read... ...Rumi. Hey, what are you up to tonight? Just work, why? We'd really appreciate it if you could keep absolute silence. We're doing this healing meditation. Super quiet. Super key, mate. Well, I'll just be working so... Hold up. Let me hop inside and get you that book. - No. - Stay here. Whoa-wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What? We don't even have any curtains up. So? Let them all watch. C... can we just go upstairs? Damon! - Find any treasure? - Jesus Christ! No, just, just a bottle cap. Can you take that out of my eyes, it's kind of hurting. Right, sorry. If you find another star like this, will you let me know? Okay. How do I contact you if I find it? Ooh, that might be tough. I live in space. Kidding! Kidding. Though technically, we all live in space, so not crazy. Here, I'll write down my number for you. Speaking of crazy, check that out, treasure hunter. Okay. Red Rover, Red Rover, I'm calling you over! Get it? Got that report handy? Yeah. How'd the presentation go? Not good. Not good. I mean, I was fuckin' great. Right, I had 'em. And after a few drinks, at the peelers I let slipped that inaccessibility line of yours and well, now they want to see some more numbers. Okay, that's not a problem. We can probably just... You remember when I poached you from Rocky Gold's survey team? You were the man. - You remember that? - Yeah. You were gonna be integral around here. You know, you were gonna help me take things to the next level. My fuckin' launching pad. Now, I gotta let you go. Rebecca in HR, she's gonna float some severance numbers by you and they aren't great, so don't even... - Fired? - I know, I know. It sucks. It sucks. - Wait... - Hey. - Hold on. - Get out there, right? Seize the fucking carpe diem by the... the fuckin' balls and throw that shit to the wind like you did when I met you! Right? Brad? Thanks for this, bud. You're invaluable. I mean, bud, you were invaluable? Don't forget that. Exploration is essential for human survival. The Single Planet Species cannot survive forever. Just as we as a species left to explore and settle on other continents, the Red Rover mission aims to expand on this human need for exploration, for new lands, new horizons. And yes, it is a one-way trip. Those going won't be coming back. But imagine human settlement on the planet Mars. We're looking for strong and intelligent applicants willing to enrich their lives by giving them over to the greatest adventure in the history of our species. The technology has evolved. It is not a matter of how. It's only a question of when. And really, the only question that truly remains is who. Will you be taking that step with us? Damon? You in there? Damon. I need to talk to you about last night. I really need to talk to you. It just felt like we're in our own little... I was in my own little universe. I have been in love with you... I asked you to come with me. Ever since that first time... Why didn't you come with me? Houston, come in, Houston. Jesus Christ! - Man, where were you there? - Nowhere. I was just thinking. Fries! I'm so hungry. Man, these are good. Sorry, I'm being rude. Hello, Damon, how was your day? Um... My God! Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you! My dad got me these. I owe you big time. I know this doesn't quite cover it, but... ...hot off the press. So did you check out that Mars thing? Yeah, I um... - Are you gonna do it? - No. I'm just doing the promo thing as a temp gig while I figure everything out and you know, um, I'd be useless up there anyway. Anyway, I should to go. I've got a date with a right swipe I meant to swipe left. See ya. Hey, do you live around here or... Yeah, just up the road. Maybe I'll see you around. Okay. Goodnight, treasure hunter. I hope you find what you're looking for. Thank you. Damon? Yeah? Hi. Hi. Did you find anything? Nothing important. Look, I I need to talk to you about last night. Yes, that was weird obviously. And it wasn't what it looked like. Yeah. It was really awkward and... and messed up. Yes, for sure, and I... I just want you to know I wasn't spying or anything like that. I... I was just walking past and I happened to see... Anyways, I'm sorry. Won't... won't happen again. Mark and I were talking last night... About it and... Yes, also apologize to Mark for me, please. Or I'll do it next time I see him. - Whatever is easy to... - Yeah, Mark... he just told me that you told him that you weren't gonna be home... - I didn't say that. - Because... No, no, no, I said I was gonna be working. Yeah, but... but because if I would have had known that then I would... You know what? - That's not the point. - But I didn't say that. - I... I... - Okay, Damon, stop, I... I don't wanna get side-tracked here. I think that it's best that we buy you out. Buy me out? Of the house. I think it's time. But it's my house. It's our house. Was our house. Exactly, and I agreed to move down here without a fight. I don't wanna fight with you now! It's just Mark and I think that this is So that's thing now, Mark and I? - Damon. - So what? You're just gonna kick me out? Sure, why not? Everybody else is. "We don't need this anymore. Let's just toss it out like a fucking dirty... Fucking dirty m... mattress." I'm sorry. Today's been... So fucked. Brad called me. He told me to be good to you tonight. So I guess he doesn't know that we're... Hey, this is an opportunity, right? Without a job, it's not like you can pay for half the mortgage. Right? Thanks for the silver lining. No, it's true. With the money from us you can just start over. You've nothing holding you back. You can go on adventures. Explore. Like you used to. Think about it. Congratulations on taking your first step towards the red planet. Red Rover invites you to join us in this great adventure. In round 1, all candidates must complete an online application, submit two reference letters and a one-minute video that explains why we should choose you. Hello. I am Cody Don Reeder and I'd be an excellent person to send to Mars. Hi. Okay, I'm Maya and my friends tell me that I like plants more than I like people. Hi, I'm Ryan. I would like to go to Mars for a dream. Hi, my name is Damon. Hey, hi. What? So I'm a nuclear engineer on submarines and aircraft carriers. And I'm in the middle of a transfer to become an FAT aerospace engineer. As a military journalist, it's my job to tell the Navy's story. I wanna be a part of the Mars story. Also important I'm a botanist, so I think you'll need somebody like me up there to... To help grow this. I'm 33 years old and I live near the beach where I like to look for things on the beach. To colonize Mars, you need people with a strong will, mind, and body. I do push-ups and I'm getting back into long-distance running. I think on the surface of Mars, I could probably nail a really epic slam dunk. In round 2, only 20 applicants who pass a rigorous interview and vetting process will be invited to New Mexico. Here, participants will live together in one of our replica space stations, competing in various training challenges broadcast to a global audience. Fuck. Hi, I'm Gary. Red Rover needs people who can build with limited resources. I believe I hold the key. I think every person who goes up, is going to have to be patient, and tolerant, and compassionate, and kind. I think with the right people, we can really do some good up there. You see, on Mars, you may need to dig a hole to survive the radiation. And I'm your man. In our final round, only four participants will be selected for the first human mission to Mars. The time has come. Red Rover, we're calling you over. This is so weird, I'm listening to you right now. Hey! Whatcha doin'? What? Sorry. Whatcha doin'? I'm out for a run. I'm just getting' in shape. Back in shape. Better shape for the... for the Mars thing. Shut up! You're doing that? Yeah. That's awesome. Congratulations. - Thank you. - We should celebrate. Well, I'm kind of in the middle of a... - Here. - Just... okay. I owe you fries anyway. Yeah, I probably shouldn't be eating... - Shut up. - Fries. Save a special spot, so no one takes it. Do you want... do you want me to put this away? Hi there, my name is Damon Pierce. I'm 33 years old and I'm from Toronto, Canada. I think I would be a great candidate for Red Rover, because I am a geologist and I work very well with others um, for... with building large infrastructure... There's more. Actually, it's mostly about geology. That... ...was terrible. My name is Damon Pierce. Um, please pick me. Crap! You just need to be more natural. Right. Yeah, okay. How do I do that? Just be yourself. And get out of that dungeon or wherever it was you shot that. It feels like a hostage video. - Jesus! - Scary. Okay. You know, maybe you're right. Maybe this was a mistake. No, no! You just need someone to help you with... - That's it! - What? That's how I'll pay you back for finding my earring. I help you make this video. - Seriously? - Yeah. Alright. And I'll only hand out Red Rover flyers to old people from now on. Cut out the competition. That's a good idea. - Yeah. - I like that. - You're sly. - Yeah. Alright, see you later, Marvin. It's... actually it's Damon. The Martian? Yeah, right. Well, I'll be sure to bring my Illudium Q-36 explosive space modulator. That was dumb. That was... That was amazing. This... that was not a good impression at all. I'll see you later. Okay. Okay. Damon? Hello? Damon? Hey, guys. Um... How you doin'? Good. What are you doing? Looks like a type of hyperbolic sleep chamber. No, I am building a replica landing pod to scale. Same thing, basically. Why? You wanna go to Mars? Well, you always told me we should have travelled more. Damon, this is ridiculous. Well, I don't think so. I think I have a good shot. They're looking for scientist types. Yeah, I've heard about this. Well, it's clearly a scam. Who's Phoebe? The woman that's probably scamming him. Why the sudden interest in my wellbeing? We just came by, because we wanted to drop this off. It is more than a fair offer, so take a look at it and then give it back at your earliest convenience. Yeah, I'll look at it. Can you do something for me? Sure. I need a reference letter. They need a professional one and a personal one. And I figured you've known me the longest, so... I don't know, I don't like this. Well, sometimes we need to do the things we don't like. Don't we? Mark. So this is how you go into space? Well, Mars specifically. What about Bea? Well, she's... - yeah, she's supportive. - So what? You would just take off for Mars, you know, and leave her here, all by lonesome? A man has gotta do what a man's gotta do. Carpe Diem, right? I gotta throw my balls into the wind, you know? I'm sold, yeah. Where do I sign? Right at the bottom. Hey, if this thing does happen for you, you think maybe we can sponsor you? You know, get a sticker on your helmet or somethin' like one of those race car drivers? - Yes. - Yeah? Sure. There you go, buddy. Okay. Thank you. - I appreciate this. - Good luck. Yeah. And action! Hi, my name is Damon Pierce and I'm a geologist. God! Wow. Okay. The talking is probably too much, we'll do it without talking and maybe put, like a voiceover thing or something, okay? - Okay. - Okay. Yeah, it's probably just the talking. - Let's do it. - Ready? Okay. Action! Pull, pull, pull, pull! I think it's the screaming. Are you being serious? Well, I'd like to see you try. Step aside. Yes! What? Yes, yes. Well, okay, you're like a third of my weight. Of course, you can do it. Okay, hop on. What do you mean? Grab my waist, hop on. - Come on. - This... Come on, I'm gonna lift you up. Come on. This is not gonna work. Hold on. Okay, that's really hard. Told you it wouldn't work. I thought it would. Next thing. Okay. Your helmet. Thank you. You wanna wear it? Yeah, you do. Okay, ready? That's good, that's good, that's good, that's good. This is nice. You're gonna film over on that thing? - Mmhmm. - Here? Thank God, water. This sand's making me so thirsty. What are you doing? Movie magic. So you look like you're sweaty. You want me to skip rope? I do. - Okay, over there. - Okay. Rolling! - What, right now? - Yeah. Is that action? Yeah. Okay. Wait, wait, wait. - You're turning it. - No, I got it. - I got it. - Hey. Good one! Okay. Okay. Okay, you know what? Okay. You know what? You're not a jump-rope guy. That's okay. Which is weird, because I have two older sisters. I guess I'm more of a double-dutch kinda guy. See, that's good. Okay, give me some jumping jacks. - Really? - Yeah. Okay. Action. Just jumping? Tell us about yourself. Hi, my name is Damon Pierce and I'm a geologist from Toronto... No, no, no, no, no, not that stuff. Nobody cares. Yeah, but a geologist is essential for assessing... Okay, cut, cut, cut! Look, I get that you're very smart, you know a lot about rocks and stuff. Well, more than just rocks. I mean I know about like where to find rocks. Nobody cares. This isn't actually about going to Mars, it's about bein' on TV, so you gotta... Open up and be likable. Well, I'm tryin'. I know. Tell us about your sisters. Are you gonna miss them? That sort of thing. I'm not really close to my family. - It's weird, I know. - Okay. No, it's okay. Um, well, why do you wanna go to Mars? I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? I don't know. So why not take off like anywhere? You could go to another city, another country. I j... I... I just feel like that wouldn't be far enough away. - What? - Do you know what? I think we... we got some good stuff. Really? I mean I can keep goin'. No, do you know what? It's getting dark and the light's bad. We'll get more tomorrow. Well, tomorrow, you really just wanna meet here or... Do you know what? Put your deets in my phone. I'll come get you. I've got a plan. Mmhmm, okay. Um, it's the basement apartment. Cool. I'll be by 6:00. Okay, sounds good. Yeah. Hey, douchebag! What? Are you serious? I don't wanna go by myself. It sucks. You... you suck. Okay, bye. Damon, what are you doin' tonight? Nothing, no. Do you wanna come with me to a thing? I I don't really... don't do that. Well, you've never gone to Mars either. It's the new you. Yeah, but I don't know. I look ridiculous. You look ridiculous? Look at me! You look hot. Alright, it's settled. ars is truly a fantastic place- . The vistas are absolutely unbelievable. I mean there is just a tremendous variation in... In the... in the land and the geology. And that provides a lot of exciting opportunities for the scientists. So it really looks like back in Mars's early history based on the chemistry and based on what we're finding in the rocks that Mars could've had a number of habitable environments in it. And so Mars may also have been an environment from which is the climate changed, which it did in a significant way, losing most of its water in a lot of its atmosphere, then life could have gone underground. God! Marvin. How the hell did you get here? Uber. Your address is in my phone blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm in your dungeon. It was a lousy thing to do, by the way. I'm sorry, what? Don't do that to people. You don't leave people like that. It's shitty. Sorry. Thank you. I have to pee. The bathroom's just through there. Thank you. Don't listen. Okay. Wow. Your neighbors are having a good time. She's fakin' it, though. I can tell. Do you want me to call you a... a cab or walk you home? Houston, we have a problem. Marvin is going to leave. Repeat, Marvin is going to leave. Over. - Hi. - Hi, there. Good morning. Whoa, whoa, sorry. Sorry. Damon? Morning. Hi. I just re-seeded out here, mate. Yeah. Yeah, so just be careful on the grass, 'cause it... It might still be poisonous. I sprayed shit everywhere. Okay... - Oops... - So who's... Hi. I'm Phoebe. You're Phoebe. Yep. I am Phoebe. That's... I'm Beatrice. I am... She's my ex. I'm Mark. Yes, and that is Mark. He's... Shacked up with this little lady. Hookin' up with my little lady. That's interesting. Yeah, so um, we'll just let you guys get back to it. Namaste. Namaste. So this situation's a little fucked up. So do you want a coffee or... No, I'm cool. Y... you sure? Yeah, I gotta get home and shower and shit. You could shower and... and shit here if you want. - Sorry? - Nothing. Okay, so that's your ex? Yeah, yeah. And you live in her basement? Currently, yeah. But it's cool. We... we made it cool. Sure. And the Aussie dude is... Her... I guess her boyfriend. So those sounds we heard last night... You ask a lot of questions. Wow! That's the stuff we should have been filming. I... I just... I... I... I moved down here like about a year ago this is just a temporary thing until we sort it out whose stuff was what, so... and then you see? Yeah. Well, we've gotta get you to Mars. I'll see you at 6:00. Right, yeah. See ya. See you then. How we're gonna get there is a tough, tough problem. Um, we would need a ship about the size of the international space station. And then we have to accelerate that clear out of the Earth's gravity well and have to fly through space for nine months to arrive at Mars. And then when you get to Mars, you can't just plan the flight and come home the way we did on the moon. The moon is always circling the Earth and you can come home anytime you want. If you land on Mars and take right back off again and try to come back to the Earth, you are likely to arrive at the Earth's distance from the sun while the Earth is on the other side of the sun. And then that's not so good. Hey. Hi. What the fuck we doin' here, pal? Well, I figured I'd see if I can hack it living in a space pod. Mmhmm. This thing to scale? Looks like a tight fit for two. You know, how the fuck you're supposed to populate Mars in this? You and Bea test this thing out yet? About that. We broke up about a year ago. She's um... she tryin' to buy me out. I can't say I didn't see that coming. Still... Is there a reason you've come here today, Brad? Remember that sponsorship thing that we agreed on? Well, I'm thinkin' bigger. Check this out. Ryugu or rura... ryugu, rup. RY... it's fuckin'... it's Japanese. It's an astroid. Estimates have got this thing at $95 billion, right, in nickel, iron, cobalt, and... and water, so we could really fuck out of that thing. There's another one, Davida. Some estimates have got this fucker at $100 trillion, right? Trillion, Damon. Davida. Space mining? Yeah. I mean these... we gotta get in now, right? You and me, we gotta be first. - So... - Read it! Read it, give me your thoughts, right? Maybe I could bring you back on as a partner, right? - Junior partner? - Brad... Damon, look, don't get me wrong. I love this, okay? I love this new you, but come on, it's not like you actually have a shot at this, right? I mean they got over... what 200,000 applicants? Gonna pick you? Come on, start thinkin' about livin' the good life down here with the rest of us, okay? And fuck Bea, right? You can buy her out. You could buy this whole fuckin' block. We're talkin' big lieu here, okay? Read this thing. Somebody's gotta read that. I gotta jet. You doin' a good job there, pal. I love it. Let's hit it, Marvin! I didn't know you had a car. Yeah. Just got it today. Yeah! When my Red Rover promo contract is up, I'm gonna load this thing up with my CDs, and my guitar, and I'm gonna tour it across the country. like a modern-day Willy Guthrie. - Woody. - The folk guy. Woody. So where are you taking me? So we are about to embark on something I like to call "simulation training." Damon, where are you going? What? How do you feel watching it? Are you nervous? It goes pretty fast. Damon. Right over us. There's fries on the ground over here. Not mine. Not yours. So what? This is your plan? You're just gonna live out of your car and see where the music takes you? Sorry, Mr. I Live in my Ex's basement and listen to her cum every night. My God! First of all, it's half my basement. Okay, sure. Second of all, you said she was faking it and I... - She is... yeah. - Totally believe you. - She is faking it. - And third, I mean here I am trying to take off to Mars, so what you are doing sounds totally reasonable and you know, doable. So I say go for it. Hell, why stop there? Why don't you try to go Mars? Um, no, it's not for me. But it's for me? Like how? I... I'm just not done here yet, you know? I mean like you seem done, like done, fucking done. Hit the escape button and start it over kind of done. Yeah, yeah, okay. And... well, I still have like a shit ton I need to do and understand here and I... I'm just not done. I mean like I would accept dying or whatever, but I mean in terms of having everything figured out here, I'm not ready. But I'm good to go? Look, it's happening. Like it is happening. Humans are going to Mars and part of me is fucking terrified of what we're gonna be doing up there. I mean like we've been here for what? The blink of an eye and look at how badly we're fucking it out here. - And what? - Wha... what am I gonna do? You're gonna offset the crazy. - You're gonna make sure that... - Offset the... how... Things start out on the right foot. How am I gonna offset the crazy when I feel like I'm crazy for even thinking about this? Which I'm only really starting to do now - and that's fucking crazy. - It is! Yes, it's fucking crazy. But look, I s... don't get me wrong. I... like I would love to do it. I try to picture the things you're gonna see and experience up there, it's mind-blowing. But for me, I think I'd always feel that... that unresolved thing back here. I... I need to get things right here first. How is this? This more your speed? Yes, see? This is nice. This is perfect. I can even see a couple of stars. Yeah. You said your dad gave you those? Yeah. Are you guys close? Yeah. He died actually. Not that long ago. Around the same time as my break up actually, so that was fun. My God, I'm sorry. Yeah. When I was little, I was obsessed with the stars. And I always used to get him to tell me the story of how the stars fell into the sky. It's a coyote story. So all the holy people had placed the stars on a buckskin that covered the Earth and they planned to arrange the stars in key places, but they couldn't agree on how. Then the coyote showed up and became impatient. He grabbed the buckskin and shook it, scattering the stars in no particular order, just so. He always used to call me his little coyote. Yeah, I could see that. These stories must seem pretty silly to you being a science guy and all. No, they're beautiful. I miss him a lot. Sorry, that's a reflex. No. No, I like it. Yeah? Yeah. Okay. - Sorry. - Yeah. - Take these off. - Yeah. You're shaking. Yeah, I'm nervous. I know, I'm sorry. Are you sure you wanna do this? I feel like I'm flying. It's a good thing. Yeah, it's amazing. I don't think I wanna leave anymore. Phoebe? You seen Phoebe? Hey, did you see Phoebe this morning? Mate, no. Hey, it's me, Damon. I didn't see where you went to this morning, so just... I don't know. I didn't see a note or anything. Maybe it fell of the desk, but just give me a call and let me know you're okay. Phoebe! Hey. Hey. What's up? I don't know, I was just... I mean do I have to say it? What? The other night when you came over and said it wasn't cool to just leave someone. Well, I was pretty drunk, Damon. Okay, but what does that have to do with anything? Look, I really have to do this, so unless you're gonna help me... Yeah, of course, I'm gonna help. Cool, can you get the stores up on Queen? Can you tell me what's wrong? Nothing's wrong. Did I do something? For fuck's sake, Damon. Well, you couldn't even text me or call? Damon, you're not my boyfriend. I mean we hooked up and it's cool, but like... Why are you doing this? I'm not doing anything. I thought last night was fun. Yeah. Look, I'm a fantasy. I'm like Mars. A distraction from your ex. That's not true. Okay. Look, you're a great guy. Go do great things and... and let me do my thing, 'cause I don't want someone just following me around. I'm... I'm not gonna f... follow you. Look. I need you to just leave me alone. Okay? Can you do that? Yeah. Hey mate. You get a chance to look over those papers? Fuck off, Mark. What's eating your ass? You don't think I know what you're doing? Mate, I'm not doin' anything. Anything I wanted to do, I already did. What's the matter? That girl Phoebe not satisfied with you either? What the fuck you doin', mate? Fuck you, you fucking fucker. Why don't you go fuck someone else's girlfriend? It's because I'm too tired from always fucking yours. Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hey! Go inside. - Go inside! - He came at me! - It was self-defense! - I don't care. Go inside. Hey, since you don't have a job, you obviously can't afford a shirt, so why don't you just fucking take mine? I already got everything I want from you. Are you okay? Just leave me. Hey. Just tilt your head back. You guys are dumb. I don't get it. Why him? I wanna say I don't know, but that would be a lie. Sometimes people just want something different. Something exciting and I guess that's what he was. Sorry. Did you ever love me? Did you even read the letter that I wrote for you? The one for Red Rover? I sent it in an email. - No. - Well... Sorry, I've been busy. Okay, what's your password? I never changed it. Okay. Here we go. "I've known Damon since high school where we met, became inseparable, and began sharing our lives together. He's good and he made me better. In the nearly 20 years of knowing him, there is one thing that has never changed. I can count on him. Damon is a dedicated and loving man, and when he commits to something, he commits for life. And considering what Red Rover is asking of applicants, you would be lucky to have him. Anyone would. So take him in and don't let go. Yours, Beatrice." Did you really mean all that? Of course. Whoa! My God. Damon, no. I asked you to come with me. Why didn't you come with me? Will you just say something? Fuck you! I'm a fantasy. I'm like Mars. I wanted you to do something. I need you to just leave me alone. Can you do that for me? Phoebe? Hello, this is Gopi Subramaniam from Red Rover. - Is this Damon Pierce? -Yes. Mr. Pierce, I'm calling to inform you that out of over 200,000 applicants - you have been pre-selected. -Um... Congratulations, you've made it to the next round. Excuse me? I d... I didn't even end up applying. Your video was one of the most viewed and liked, and in the shortest amount of time. Barely 12 hours. - Viral, I believe... -Seriously? I... I didn't make a video. We'll be conducting one-on-one interviews in your area - in about two weeks. - Okay. So hopefully this is just the beginning. Hi, I'm Phoebe and I'm here to talk about Damon, because... well, to be honest, he's not the greatest at talking about himself. For example... Hi, my name is Damon. I'm... Hi, my name is Damon. What? See what I mean? Now, I have to be quiet, because Damon is actually asleep right now in that pod. And he built that pod to practice what it would be like living on Mars. He was considering not applying, but I think that would have been a mistake. I think you guys need him. He's committed. Dude lives in his ex-girlfriend's basement. No joke. How's that for loyalty? He's smart. I mean he's a geologist. Pretty sure you'll need that. He may not be the strongest person... Hi, my name is Damon Pierce. My God. But his heart is probably the strongest I've ever been around. I think this new world you're trying to build out there deserves him more than I do, because if you pick him, that world will be good. Hi, I'm Phoebe and I'm here to talk about Damon, because... well, to be honest, he's not the greatest at talking about himself. For example... So I took a look at your file, but I found something that I think might be a little bit more interesting. Lithium? Yeah, you want to talk about a growing market? How about the key metal that goes into making an electric car battery. Electric car? God, why can't we just be men again? Right? It's called "evolution", Brad. Damon, come on. What? I see what you're doin' here, okay? It's nice. Hell, it's even profitable you know, but not at the same numbers as my space thing, right? Well, yeah, I realize that... W... with Mars, what do you think you're a part of? What do you think that is? It's an opportunity to explore. We're colonizing it - for Christ sakes. - Come on. I don't think it's strictly about colonizing. We're already doing scans of the planet to see what's in it. Hey, why do you think that is? To expand our pleasant benign species and improve the galaxy? I mean yeah, that's the face of NASA and space travel, but that's not the reality behind it. It's business, okay? It's resources. Trust me, you're gonna hit Mars and the rest of the planets are gonna fall like fuckin' dominos. Space mining, it isn't crazy, it's the future. Well, I think we can do better. Okay, you wanna change the world, it's not gonna happen, right? It's just gonna be the same shit in a different place and probably sped up 100 times to what we know now, right? - So let's take advantage. - Well, I don't know. I think that's small-minded, short-sighted thinking. Surveys of Mars, right? It's already begun! Alright, you wanna talk small? Let me ask you something. When you step on an ant, do you feel bad or you even notice? Now, because that's how small we are in the grand scheme of things. Hell, we're smaller. We walk around talkin' about destroying the planet. I got news for you, buddy, the planet's dyin' anyway. All things do. God, we're so self-involved. But here's the thing. We're nothin', right? We are nothin'. You know what? It's okay. Does it really matter? Not really. This gasp we call "life", we should get the things we want? We should enjoy the things we enjoy, because otherwise, what are we doin' here, right? Doesn't make us bad humans. It just makes us human. Red Rover? Yeah. So you ready for the world to see you? Well... We still have to get to the next step for that. You know, they're live-streaming the interviews around the world. Really? Yeah, did you... Did you not read the email package? My God. Do you want some coffee? Probably not a great idea. It'll make me very sweaty. Also, I'm a bit of a coffee snob. Well, I hear there are great cafes on Mars, so you'll be fine. I'm Maya, by the way. - Damon. - Nice to meet you. I mean I know who you are. I watched your video. I watched everybody's video. I'm a little OCD. Yours was great. Yeah, I know why they picked you. Thank you. Also, you're a geologist, which is great. Where's the underground water please? Check. What do you do? I'm a botanist. Yeah, you're the botanist. No, I watched your video, it was good. Gonna need you. Well, it's nice to feel needed. Damn it! Wow, he looked like... Yeah, maybe that was his happy face. Damon Pierce? You're up. Thank you. Hey, aren't you going to tell me to break a leg or something? You're more likely to break a few hearts. Hi, I'm Phoebe and I'm here to talk about Damon, because... well, to be honest, he's not... Hi. Thank you. Damon. Welcome. Gopi Subramaniam. - Hi. - Please, have a seat. Thank you. Damon, firstly, I want to congratulate you for advancing to this round. Thank you. As you may be aware we are looking for people who have experience in extreme working conditions and analysis, but also someone who plays well with others. Right, of course. Couple that with the overwhelming response to your video and you quickly became one of the favorites. People loved you. I think they connected with your broken man trying to fix himself, "that could be me" thing, which was great. Awesome. So Damon, this is an opportunity for us to get to know you a little better. For us and the people watching. Great. So Damon, now that you've reached this point, how do you feel about the potential mission? How do you mean? Your thoughts. Your feelings. Your personal situation. Your fears. I'm... I... I'm sorry, I don't quite understand what you're asking. Well, you are potentially going away, never to return. Your life as you know it, will no longer exist for you or for the people you leave behind. Yeah, that's... That's not a concern. Perhaps, you have some questions for us. No, I don't think so. No. Okay. We'll be in touch. No, you know what? I do. I do have a question. Please. What exactly will we be doing up there? Well, the four people chosen for the reality show will start their training... No, no, I know all that. But what is it we'll be doing? We came here wanting to start over. To... to be new. Or at least that's what we told ourselves when the truth is we weren't starting over, we were just expanding on the old. And I'm worried that that's what Mars is gonna become. I... I just... I... I'm hoping that whoever does get picked that they are rooted in something more meaningful than just hitting the escape button on Earth. I hope that Red Rover is about being truly new, because that would be something. Our best human foot forward. Otherwise, we have no right to go up there. Not you, not you. Certainly not me. No. What are we doing? You just had to be there you know, to feel it. I can't believe you got to experience that, I'm so jealous. I looked it up on the internet, it looks incredible. Apparently, it's because of dinoflagellates. They're the reason... they like warn of predators or... Like they light up. Basically, that's why they light up. It just felt like we were in our own little... I was in my own little universe. See? That's what I love about us. Even when we're apart, we're still together. Which is why I have a very special question for you. Damon, I actually wanted to talk to you about... - Beatrice... - Something... I have been in love with you ever since that first time you sat in front of me in Mrs. Smith's English class. One of the greatest nights of my life was our prom night when we finally... - Damon. - Right. I'll just get to it. Beatrice. Having you gone this past month has reminded me... How much I want you in my life forever and ever. And I know you said our love doesn't need anything formal, but... - Well... - Stop, stop, Damon. Fine. It's okay. Hey. I met someone. I didn't mean to. Um, we just had this connection. He was in Melbourne and his name is Mark. God. Damon, will you just stand up, please? Just stand up. Okay, I'm so, so, so, so, so, sorry. Just... I just... why didn't you come with me? I asked you to come with me. Will you just say something? Why? I wanted you do to something. I went to your mom's. I got this ring re-set. This is your great grandmother's ring. I kept this on me every day while you were gone. I walked around with it in my pocket, walking down the street, smiling like a fucking idiot, waiting for you to come back. I was doing something. I was waiting for you. I'm sorry, Damon. I'm sorry. Sorry. Fuck this. I'm sorry. Damon! What do you want? Is Beatrice here? Why? I have something I wanna give her. Why don't you just give it to me? Because it's not for you. I do have something else for you, though. Signed in triplicate. You were right. It's more than fair. Bea! Damon's here! - Hey. - Hi. Thank you. Can we have some privacy? We're good. - Hi. - Hi. - Ooh. - Don't worry. I'm not proposing. Again, sorry, I should have prefaced that. Yeah. But I do need to give this back to you. I have searched for this almost every day for the last year or so. I didn't know what I was gonna do when I found it or even why I was looking for it. Well, okay, I think a part of me thought that maybe if I found it, it would bring us back together, but, yeah. Um, this was supposed to be a symbol of our life-altering union. But now, I know the real reason why I needed to find it and give it back to you. It was about we could be apart. I just... I couldn't leave while it was lost. So... Wow. I'm gonna miss you. I'm gonna miss you, too. So what's next? Can you go to Mars? I doubt it. I kind of blew that one. But somewhere. I'll head out somewhere. Hey, Damon? Thank you. Yeah. Hello? Is this Damon? Yes, it is. Damon, it's Gopi. Calling to let you know you've been selected. What? For the show. You're one of 20 people selected to come to New Mexico. Holy shit. Yeah, but... But what about all those things I said? I believe human expansion is likely inevitable, but I feel if we have people like you, we can at least try to do it the right way. That girlfriend of yours is right. We could really use you. She's not my... We'd like you out here as soon as possible. You have 48 hours to pack a small bag of belongings, and say your goodbyes to whoever you need to, and congratulations. Thank you. Hey, douchebag! Hey, Phoebe, it's Damon. Got some crazy news for you. I got in. I'm goin' to Mars. Just thought you might like to know. Thank you. Hope you're well. I knew you would be picked. - Congratulations. - You, too. Thank you. After that amazing speech, you were a shoe-in. Did you watch mine? No. - I'm sorry. - Okay. I... no, I kinda left the scene of the crime after I dropped that bomb in the room. Probably for the best. All I did was talk about how amazing your speech was and how great you would be on the show. Wow, that is very flattering. - Yeah. - Thank you. Also kind of embarrassing. I was shocked when I got picked, actually. - Really? - Yeah. I think the producer pushed for me. I think she thinks something crazy could happen if they put us in a room together. Well, I'm not surprised. So are you ready for this? Um, I don't know. I haven't flown in a while and I really don't like flying. Are you serious? Do you think that might be a problem? - Yes, I do. - Yeah? Okay. Okay, I'm gonna help you. - Are you now? - Yeah. Okay. - Close your eyes. - What? Just close your eyes. Okay, so you're sitting in your chair and... 20 seconds and counting. Your name is on your - space suit. - Okay. T-minus 15 seconds, guidance is internal. Belt yourself in. - 12, 11, 10, 9... - 8... - Ignition sequence starts. - Go for main engine start. - The engine starts. - 6, 5... 6, 5, 4... And you're up. You're in space. Everything's in flight. What do you see? It's called the "overview effect". When at that scale you see all as one. Here men from the planet Earth... I can't wait to see that. first set of foot upon the Moon. July 1969 AD. What's wrong? I can't wait to see that. What's wrong? Thank you. Phoebe. What are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be... I wanted to see you play. Yeah, well, no one else did. That's okay. No, it's not okay. I don't know why I thought it'd be any different. It can be different. - How? - I don't know. I don't know, we'll figure it out together. Together? You were ready to fly to Mars just so you could start over and when it gets tough, you'll leave again or I don't know, fuckin' die. So what about you? What about me? "It didn't work out for me here, so I'm gonna move over there. Look, it didn't work again, so I'm just gonna leave." Hey, I get it, I'm scared, too. I'm terrified. What? What? I'm coming with you. Damon, we can't. Why not? Let's just go. Look, I'm already packed. No, we were just very sad and desperate, and we gave each other a nice little bump when we needed it and we should just leave it be. Phoebe, you've changed everything about me. My fault lines and my fractures. Like they've all eroded and calcified. Everything has changed, because of you. Damon. - Look, I... - I know this might not work out, but I was willing to die up there. For what? To escape? I can't do that anymore. I wanna go with you. I was built to live here with you. I'm callin' you over. What? Red Rover. Red Rover. I'm callin' you over. And I'm not gonna let go. Okay. Well, here we go.
