It all started with the breakup. First from one person, and then from the rest of society. I should say now, I never meant for any of this to happen. What eventually became of me was not what I had set out to become. I wanted what any of us want, to make a difference in the world. To love and be loved. Possibly to rescue a dog. Maybe I was just trying to make sense of this crazy world of ours, which is impossible. Our universe consists of patterns so complex, it's impossible to know what you're missing, let alone where to look. How can you explain something you don't truly understand? Wait. What are you doing? Don't you see, Ashley? I am setting you free. The cult was founded in the spirit of social consciousness, as its doctrine included largely vegetarian diets and a ban on social traditions deemed inauthentic by the cult's leader. A ban that was strictly enforced. Little did they know, however, this was their fearless leader's last night on Earth. Ooh! God, why do you keep doing that? -'Cause it's funny. -Ugh, if it was funny, -I would laugh. -I'm laughing. I don't laugh like that. Oh, you absolutely laugh like that. You know, for somebody who's so hypersensitive to others, your lack of self-awareness is shocking, Scout. Scout? Scout, please. I-- Ooh! - I hate you. - No! Fear releases dopamine, which simulates the feeling of falling in love, a feeling which doubles down when you finally realize you're safe. So, technically, like, you're welcome. Nope. Mm-mmm. -What about, like, uh-- -Mm-mmm. Okay. Fine. What are you tweeting? Politics. Oh, what-- what politics? You hate politics. No, I don't. I care a lot about politics. What kind of politics? Fine. Mitch McConnell's pushing a confirmation in the Ninth Circuit, but HuffPost just released a dossier th... Sorry, I just fell asleep. Just got bored listening to all that horse race politics. It's like, zoom out. It has nothing to do with the bigger picture, which is arguably much more important. Do you even know what horse race politics is? Or are you just repeating something that you heard in a podcast? Repeating something I heard off a podcast. Yeah. Whi-- which is like a verbal retweet. It's the same concept, basically. Okay. Fine, true. You're right. I'm sorry. I love you. Hmm. Psst, your line is, "I love you, too, Natasha." Any time. Right. It's just love is like an incredibly powerful human emotion. And it feels, like, reductive to limit it to call and response. You know, it's like, "Marco," "Polo." -"I love you." "Polo." -I love you, too. You know what I do love, though? Popcorn. I'm gonna make some. I'll be back. Please don't eat in bed, Scout. I can tell when you do, 'cause there's crumbs. I'm serious. It wakes me up. Scout, are you even listening? Polo. You were so scared. You were like, "Ah!" Do you ever hate people so much that you find yourself rooting for global warming? Wake me up for the revolution. L-O-L. Okay. I'm in a parking lot. A security guard approaches, nervously. He's new to the job. Probably because the job didn't exist before. I miss my cousin. You know, I'd do anything to get him back. Anything? This is a telecom worldwide prepaid phone call from-- What happened to Dante Emilio Goochman? His keys were found behind the club. Shots weren't all that was fired that night. It sounded like a Taser or, I don't know, like, one of those, um... - A Taser? - From WLEZ. This is Justice Al Dante. Episode 1: Saturdays Are for the-- Episode 22: Dude, Where's My Bro? We still don't know what happened to Dante. Good morning, my love. -What we do know... -Natasha? ... is the more you know, the more you don't know. Natasha? "I can't do this anymore. I'm leaving. Natasha." Very funny, Natasha. Good-- good joke. Natasha? "P.S. This is not a joke. It if was meant to be funny, I'd laugh. And the fact that you probably are laughing right now is even more evidence that we were never compatible in the first place. And furthermore, evidence that--" Oh, my God. She's gone. Natasha?

But, like, let's be honest, it's not some woo-woo shit. It is some scientific fact. Wherever you are in life listening to this podcast, you're exactly where you want to be. Podcast. The other day, I was on a jog in the park and I passed by a couple taking wedding photos. Everything about them disagreed. Their body language, the tone of their speech. At one point, the groom put his hand on the bride's shoulder and she winced. The relationship was the definition of toxic. But neither of them was able to leave. That's what makes it a relationship. But I'm getting ahead of myself. In 1920, Italian designer, Thayat, published a sewing pattern for a garment he called the most innovative, futuristic garment ever produced. What we now call the jumpsuit. He called it the TuTa. ♪ Our Big Mac is the biggest ♪ ♪ Our healthcare is the sickest ♪ ♪ Fried chicken comes with biscuits ♪ ♪ Our nation is the narcissistics ♪ ♪ Gerrymandered districts ♪ ♪ Tax cuts for the richest ♪ ♪ Brexit, wait, that's British ♪ ♪ America, the bigliest ♪ More than just an outfit, the TuTa was designed as a revolutionary garment for the new man, a democratic uniform, the end of wasteful couture. It's a bold move, creating something that will make your entire industry obsolete. But that's just what Thayat set out to do. Set fire to a relationship he knew had grown toxic. So, what happened next? Revolution in the streets? Not exactly. The upper class took on jumpsuits as an ironic trend. That's capitalism for you, baby. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. But if it is broken, do. America is in a toxic relationship and it can't get out. But we can. ♪ Our Big Mac is the biggest ♪ ♪ Our health care is the sickest ♪ ♪ Fried chicken comes with biscuits ♪ ♪ Our nation is the narcissistics ♪ ♪ Gerrymandered districts ♪ ♪ Tax cuts for the richest ♪ ♪ Brexit, wait, that's British ♪ ♪ America, the bigliest ♪ There is no legal right in the United States for an individual to secede.

Al Gore won the popular vote in 2000. So did Hillary Clinton in 2016. So, why weren't either of them president? The defining characteristic of a republic is citizens electing politicians to represent their interests. You can't win an election by losing the vote.

Right there. Right there. I call this first official meeting for the sovereign nation state of Scoutopia to order. Uh, rollcall first. Uh, Scout, present, Doge? Great, that's a quorum. Uh, next order of business, we need to elect a benevolent dictator. Because, Doge, benevolent dictator's the most effective form of government, otherwise we could end up, like, mired in debate. And the whole point of Scoutopia is to take action. If it doesn't make sense, it's time to make change. Yeah, I did hear that on a podcast. Obviously. I'll throw out a nomination on the floor. Scout Durwood for the role of benevolent dict-- dictator. Do I have a second? Doge, work with me. What, do you want to do it? You don't even have thumbs. All right, second, that's a second. Scout, time for a speech. You have the floor. Wow. First off, let me just say how... I mean, how honored I am to be nominated for this incredibly prestigious role of benevolent dictator. Benevolent, bene, from the Latin meaning "well," and velle, meaning "to wish." A well-wisher and someone who wishes well with the absolute authority to enforce her-- or his, or his. Her or his vision of a better world. If elected benevolent dictator, I will work tirelessly to promote the ideals we hold dearest here in Scoutopia, including environmentalism. Uh, I believe music should be played at a reasonable volume. Also, I don't think we need an Oxford comma. There I said it. I promise to pass the Bechdel test. I promise to invest in innovation over tradition. Because you know what they say. The definition of insanity is these prices! It's time to give the power back to the people by taking it away from them entirely. So, vote for me for benevolent dictator and I promise to wish you well. Also, death to all squirrels. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Scout. Way to read the room. All those in favor of Scout for benevolent dictator, please say, "Aye." Aye. All opposed? Abstentions? Doge, work with me here, we can't pass this without a quorum. Great. The motion passes. As of this moment, Scout is officially benevolent dictator of the sovereign nation state of Scoutopia on this 23rd day of Scoutember.

Where the hell have you been? I've been trying to get a hold of you for two days. Sorry. Natasha cut me out of the family plan. Don't apologize, it takes away your authority. Ooh, so, she's really gone, huh? I don't know, Britney, I feel like there's a chance. You got a dog? I love dogs. Come here. Yes, I got a dog. I'm an entirely new person. Careful, she doesn't like flannel. Okay, you're clearly emotionally distraught. - I'm not distraught. - Trust me, you're distraught. Remember when Clarissa left and you didn't eat anything for three days? Have you been eating? I brought snacks. I'm eating. Popcorn doesn't count as a food. -Neither does rosé. -Yes, it does. So, she really took everything. You're gonna have to get new stuff. Actually, I don't-- I don't feel like I want new stuff. -You have to have stuff. -Why? Because it's stuff. Did you-- did you fall and hit your head? Yes, why? 'Cause you're bleeding. You're also acting really weird. I'll go get Band-Aids. Natasha took all the Band-Aids. Bitch. - I'll take care of it. - Stop. -Oh. -What are you doing, honey? I wiped it. I wiped it. Now you have blood on your shirt. Now I have blood on my shirt. You're right, I'm gonna go change. -You have blood on your shirt. -I know, I'll change. Honestly, I'm glad she's gone. -Britney? Oh. -No, Natasha. we didn't get along. And I get along with everyone. I mean, Clarissa and I get along great, and she's a raging narcissist. -You need to spackle this. -She wasn't a narcissist. Uh, yes, she was. She dressed up as herself for Halloween, including a wig. Look, can we stop talking about my exes and focus on the amazing transformation that is underfoot? I am an entirely new person. You have popcorn in your teeth. -You have popcorn in your butt. -Great. - Can I borrow this? - Yes. You know what? As a matter of fact... So, are there cups, or... we supposed to just chug this like a poor person? All clothing except for jumpsuits is illegal now. -Scoutopia. -What's Scoutopia? It's my sovereign nation state. Girl, you can't just wear jumpsuits. Yes, I can, Ashley. Imagine the future, okay? -What are people wearing? -Jetpacks. Fenty by Rihanna. What? No, no. They're wearing jumpsuits, utilitarian jumpsuits. I mean, the technology exists. Why hold ourselves back? What are we, the coal industry? It's been 48 hours. Oh, yeah, Ashley, as if time were linear, okay? Viva la revolución. -This is fun. -Why can't you just have sex with a Tinder person, like a normal human being? Did you know Natasha's dad voted for Trump, and I didn't say anything because, like, I didn't want it to be, I don't know, awkward. I mean, we live our entire lives on autopilot. And why? For what? Why? I've been on autopilot this whole time? I had no idea. You can't spell success without seceding. That's why I'm my own country now, okay? From now on, if something is not 100% authentic to who I am, I'm out. I'm not doing it. Scoutopia. Do you still want to go to the brunch rave? Obviously, it's a brunch rave. Okay, great, Britney, put this in your jumpsuit. I love brunch. Did you know there's no such thing as local honey? Bees aren't even native to North America. Everything we've been taught to believe in is a lie. Do you want me to get started about the gold industry? I mean, you want to talk about a corrupt industry-- Okay, I hear you. But literally, who cares? I do. About everything. But every day I'm trying to meditate and be more like him. - The DJ? - Ugh, no. No one wants to be more like a DJ. Like him. Feet firmly planted, waving in the breeze. Going whenever life takes you. A party full of music, and yet only one of us is brave enough to dance. Okay, you just got dumped by your fiancée, so maybe we take a beat. That's exactly my point. I don't even believe in marriage. And Natasha knew that. As far as I'm concerned, straight people should have been marching to get out rather than gay people marching to get in. Hmm, fair. And who was the first-- who was the first woman to be like, "Oh, I want to throw a love party and I'm going to invite all my friends and I'm going to wear white. And then no one else at the party gets to wear white." You gotta find a jiggly piece. "But some of my friends are going to wear a dress in a different color, and that color is going to match the accent color on my flowers. And then when I finish with my flowers, I'm going to throw it at my friends." Damn, you're good. "Also, I want a cake. What kind of cake? I don't know. I'm going to try all the kinds of cake in a day of testing. Even though as an adult woman, I've clearly had all the kinds of cake. No, I want you to line the cake types up in front of me. And then I'm gonna taste them one by one. A carrot cake. Yellow cake. Princess cake. Ribbon cake. Sprinkle cake. Confetti cake. I want to try all of the kinds of cake." I love cake. Are we done with this bit or do you have more? "Also, I want everybody to bring me presents, but I get to pick which presents." How hard did you hit your head today? I don't know, Ashley, just hard enough. No! Jenga. - How could you do that? - Scout effing Durwood. - Who's that? - That is-- Scout fricking Durwood. Can you please, 'cause I have this. 'Cause-- What the S are you doing here? Oh, hi. Uh, Jade, this is Ashley. - Ashley, Jade. - Hi. - Britney. - Britney, yeah. And this is The Inuit word for love. Come again? The Inuit word for love. Sorry, what's the Inuit word for love? My baby. Right. And-- and what's the baby's name? The Inuit word for love. -Which is... -Oh, I can't say it, because that would be appropriation. But my husband and I just really wanted to pay homage to the people who came before us. So, it's kind of like a respect thing. That's what this feels like right now. Respect. Well, he is Canadian, right? Oh, beautiful language. - Canadian? - Inuit. Oh, I know. Did you guys know they have over, like, a hundred words for snow? Did you know that no, they don't? See, the Inuit language makes a compound word out of nouns and their modifiers. So, white snow, for example, becomes one word, whitesnow, or yellow snow to yellowsnow. Not to be confused with slipperysnow. Or is it gonnasnow or snowysnow? Did you know Americans have 13 different words for the submarine sandwich? Hero, hoagie, grinder, sub, meat bed, tuna pocket, bread basket, slider, pita futon, pizza... roll. There's a lot. There's so many, I could keep going. And yet only one word for love. Speaking of which, where is Natasha? Uh, we-- we broke up. Well, most relationships end. Except for the one you have with yourself. That, you can hold on to for forever. Unless you're an asshole about it. Can you please-- can you please not curse in front of the baby? I didn't curse in front of your baby. You-- you did. You said-- you said the A word, Ashley. -It's not appropriate. -I'm sorry. I didn't know I was cursing in front of your baby. Yeah, and now you woke him up. You woke him up. I'm not in front of your baby. Well, you woke him up with your cursing, so... Come here. Oh, hi. - Do you want to hold him? - No, I don't. -Are you sure? -Yeah, I'm fine. -I'm totally fine. -You won't drop him. I am-- I'm good, without the-- Scout, I literally don't mind, okay. No, I don't-- I don't-- I don't want to hold the baby. -Scout.

I have bars in my purse. Scout, wait up. Scout, why you walking so fast? Because I can. Do you see these cars down there? Yeah. Every one of them thinks that their destination is the most important on the road. But if any one of them tries to beat the system by-- by changing lanes, or-- or moving faster than the speed of traffic, then the entire system breaks down, and every one of them is moving more slowly than if they'd been moving together the whole time. Come on. That's why driverless cars are going to be such a big deal. Not only do they mitigate human ego, they mitigate human error. For what is humanity, if not a vessel ..for well-intended mistakes. Whoa. You, like, think about a lot of stuff. It's a prison! See that car over there? - Yeah. - Okay, well, idling your car for more than, like, 10 seconds at a time, horrible for your engine. -But I thought that-- -No, that is a myth. It's also terrible for the environment. And in neighborhoods where it happens a lot, it delays brain development in kids. It results in childhood asthma. And yet people do it all the time. People go to drive-thrus to idle their car. Idle car, idle heart. Well, maybe she doesn't know. I'll go tell her. No, you can't go around correcting people who don't want to be corrected. It's rude and it's ineffective and they hate you. And yet I can no longer abide living in a world so wedded to being wrong. Therefore, Scoutopia. - Whoa. - Hey, what route did you guys take? That took forever. You guys hungry? I want some tacos. Wait, we're not wedded to being wrong. I don't know, Ashley just upgraded to the 11. What, my phone? Shoots in 8k. How cool is that? It's also planned obsolescence. I want to join Scoutopia. Wait, are we still talking about this? Scoutopia doesn't exist, Britney. Scout made it up. Okay, first of all, all countries are made up. And second of all, no, you don't. It is very hard being a Scoutopian. Like, we can't even chew gum unless it's specifically labeled biodegradable. Gum isn't biodegradable? No, it's also the second most littered item on the planet. Cigarette butts are number one. -Talk about a sticky situation. -Yeah, well, you're welcome. Look, my parents raised me to believe that I could be anything. Do you know how stressful that is? Oh, I didn't know you were born in the '90s. Let me join Scoutopia. I don't know, running a sovereign nation state is going really well for me right now, and I don't want to jeopardize that by, like, attracting human followers. Okay, well, then who's that creeper? What? Hi. Sorry, I, like, couldn't help but overhear you at the brunch rave. And I totally agree. And also traffic? Pew! Who knew? Oh, thank you. What's Scoutopia? It's our sovereign nation state. -Do you want to join? -Yes. No, no, to this. We don't even know this person. I don't know, Scoutopia has open borders, it's like... -They do? -Mmm-hmm. Okay, well, you just can't chew your gum. Oh, yeah, no problem. You have to-- Yeah. Give it. Hand it over. I'll take it. Yeah. Safekeeping. Okay, great. This is great. Scout, what are you doing? -This is insane. -Oh, no, no, idling your car is insane. This is inspiring social change. -What's next? -Next we live our lives and go through the world trying to make it a better place.

People used to think that after you sneeze, the devil was gonna-- That the devil was gonna steal your soul. That the devil was gonna reach inside your nose holes, pull your soul out of it and replace it with an evil spirit. Is that what you believe, Ashley? -No-- -No, of course not. Because Ashley is a rational, thinking human being. Or... is she? Because knowing all of this, when Kourtney sneezed... She blessed her. Why? Because you value tradition over original thought. -Okay, isn't that right? -I wasn't-- Thinking? No, of course you weren't thinking.

Dope shades, by the way. I really like them. I had a pair just like them. Lost them on a jet ski at my cousin's place in Tahoe. Yeah, we used to get up there, like, once a year. Bunch of dudes, you know, just hanging out doing dude stuff. Still got the key, you know, just in case. Anyway, I got a vodka tonic calling me "Daddy" upstairs, so, uh, I better hit it. Good talking to you. You know, Tahoe's only seven hours from here. Six if I open her up. Nah, man, that's-- that's really dope of you to offer, but I-- I gotta pass. -Thanks anyway, though. -Saturdays are for the boys. You know what, bro? Fuck it. Um, excuse me. Sorry. I don't mean to step on anybody's toes, but I'm mostly positive that we missed my stop. I think we passed it. Oh, God. Mm. ♪ Taxi, take me home ♪ Oh, God, thank God. Can you turn on the AC? Um, sorry, do you know that cigarette butts are, like, the most littered item on the planet? What are you, from Planet Do-Gooder? Ugh, thank God. I am starving. We've been intermittently fasting because apparently that's a thing. On top of these insane hours, it's only going to get worse the closer we get to November. Wait, do you guys know each other? What, is she-- Are you kidding? I cannot take her right now. Wait, wait, wait. Wait. Please trade me. Come on, we get to smoke cigarettes even though we lobby against tobacco.

Oh, don't worry, I've already heard this podcast. -It's cool. -Put your phone away. Yeah, show your leader some respect. It's okay, Kourtney. Carrie. Ashley's free to do whatever she wants. We value individual choice here in Scoutopia, do we not? I said do we not? Nothing is more important than individual loss -and critical thought. -Critical thought. Yeah, great. Thank you. Now, Ashley, what, uh-- what's so important it couldn't wait? Oh, nothing. I've just-- I've already listened -to this podcast, so... -What podcast? Yeah, what are you talking about? Have you not noticed? Most of what she's saying she heard on a podcast. What? No. Is that true? Uh, technically, yeah, it is. But wouldn't it be insane to think I researched -everything myself? -No, right, but anecdotal news is problematic, and that's often the basis for podcast narratives, so... Interesting point, Ashley. You got it. Anyone else here listen to podcasts? Oh, I do. Perhaps I am not the free thinker I aspire to be. Everyone, take out your phones. Go ahead, take them out. That's right. In 1971, there was a famous anti-littering campaign nicknamed the Crying Indian. Their nickname, not mine. Yeah. Problematic. Yeah. In that commercial, a Native American man sheds a single tear in response to highway litter. And who sponsored that campaign? Beverage manufacturing companies. Who were trying to avoid regulation on their newly released invention, non-reusable packaging. Yeah, people who litter are monsters, they said. But how dare we criticize the corporations who are filling their hands with trash? Treat the symptoms, ignore the disease. You know where I first heard about -the Crying Indian campaign? -On a podcast? On a podcast. Cell phones are illegal now. Scoutopia. Everyone please smash-- -- phones. Ashley? -Yeah. -Would you like to go next? -No. -Why not? You can't expect us to follow you blindly. That goes against everything that we stand-- -...for. -Look, the point of Scoutopia is to be better versions of ourselves. I thought the point of Scoutopia was to be fiercely judgmental and mostly vegetarian. You are free to make whatever decision you wish to make, as long as you make the right one. -Now smash your phone. -No. Don't you see you are holding on to something that is holding you back. I'm trying to help you. Look, I get that you don't want to wear a bra anymore. I mean, who does? And honestly, these jumpsuits are super comfy, but this is insane. Au contraire, Ashley, this is insane. Tap twice if you like me. Tap twice if you wish to be liked. Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap. -Stop it. -Tap, tap, tap. They threaten you with obscurity and from obscurity, you obey. -Hey, you're scaring me. -Good! You'll appreciate it even more when you finally realize that you're safe. -Give me my phone. -No, I-- ow! -Natasha has cancer. -What? "Just found out it's cancer, but my new girlfriend is the perfect nurse. Thank you to everyone for all your thoughts and prayers. #FuckCancer, #Hope" Scout, I had no idea. Most relationships end.

Okay, I need everyone to just give me a minute. Eenie, meenie, minie-- ooh! I think she's gone. Ooh. No, no, no, no. Doge? Doge, doge. Oh, my goddess, I thought I lost you, too. Oh, shade. I cannot believe how badly this is going. I lost my coat. I lost my friends. My dog won't even talk to me. At least now I officially have nothing left to lose. Touché. This is your stop. Oh, I think this is your stop. I'm closer to La Brea. Oh, my God, I cannot with this girl. Bubbla. Britney. Welcome. There are over 30,000 bees in this hive, and yet only one queen. Do you feel like there's something special about you? Something that separates you from everyone else? -No. -Me neither. Because we are the Britneys, universal followers who maintain order by supporting our hive. Without us, no leader can lead, for without us... there's no one to be led. Did you know there's no such thing as local honey? Bees aren't even native to North America. -I read that on a podcast. -A great sentiment. However, think-- think of all the wonderful things they've done since they arrived. They take the sweetest bits of this, the most potent bits of that. You know, if bees go extinct, that all of humanity will die. Yet another sticky situation. Pure change is more than just a great idea. I get a great idea. You got a great idea. We all get great ideas. It's about follow up, follow through, followers. Go be that follower, Britney. Don't let your leader give up. Scram. Get out of here. -Wait, where are you going? -Well, this is your stop. I don't even know where I am. Wait, has your car been idling this entire time? Don't you care anything about the environment? Idle car, idle heart. Scout? Scout, wait up! So this is what the end of hope looks like. Nothing to hold on to, nothing to hold me back. Scout. Scout. Hi. Oh, my gosh. Britney. -Hi. -Where have you been? I took a Lyft. I thought I told you. Yeah, but that was two days ago. I know. So what did I miss? Well, kind of a lot. Uh, I was confronted by my evil twin. I singlehandedly negated all of the good I set out to create in the world. And in a quest for power, I have become everything I hate, as evidenced by the fact that everyone I love now hates me. Oh. That sounds tough. Yeah, Britney, this is all turning out to be significantly tougher than I ever dreamed it could be. Well, hey, don't give up. What you mean, don't give up? Everything I've done since Natasha left me is garbage. Not everything. I pledge allegiance to the wacky waver of the United States of Scoutopia... And to the shepublic for which it stands, one nation under Scout, indivisible, with liberty and justice for Scoutopia. Scout, life is a party filled with music. It'd be a shame if you were no longer brave enough to dance. Thanks, Britney. You're right and I needed that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a cult to save. Yeah! Go do it! You got this, Scout. Oh, my God. I'm doing it. I'm a Britney and I'm a follower and I'm doing it. Wait, Scout, wait up. God damn it. I'm an idiot. Okay. ♪ Feet like a trunk and shake your butt ♪ ♪I'm gonna do this and change the world ♪ ♪ Sky dancer ♪ I got this. I got this. I can't do this. What am I doing? I can't just-- I'm going to do this. I got this. Okay. Eyes on the prize, changing the world. You've got this, Scout. Into the abyss. - Hello? - Oooh! You're right. That's fun. That's-- ooh! -Who are you? -Oh, how rude of me. I'm Scout. That's impossible. I'm Scout. Surely you can't think there's only one of you in the universe. Oh, you do? -Well, how quaint. -There's more than one of me? There's more than one of everybody. Literally everything in the universe exists because of patterns in math. I forgot how endearingly preoccupied this universe is with trying to be special. Spoiler alert, there's no such thing. I'm from an alien planet populated entirely by people who look and act just like you. I've come to take you there. Come on, let's go home. I-- I-- What are you doing? Don't you want to come home? - What about my friends? - What about them? You said it yourself. They're medium friends. Yeah, but they're my medium friends. Okay, well, now I'm your medium friend. Technically, I am a liaison between worlds. A medium, if you will. Devastating, really, that this world can't be saved. These separations are never pleasant. But as they say, the fate of the universe -depends on us, so... -Separations. Do you know where the word utopia comes from, Scout? Yeah, obviously it's Greek. "Ou" meaning not, and "topos", meaning place. Utopia. - Not a place. - Mm-hmm. But a youtopia? Y-O-U. Now there's a juice that's worth the squeeze. A metopia? There are infinite topias in the universe. Generally speaking, people prefer to mix and match, entropy being what it is and all. But every once in a while, the conversation gets a little too... rowdy. One of these separations begins. You can already see the roots of it here. I mean, there are infinite points of view available, and yet most people prefer an echo chamber of their own. Right, but there's no way the solution is to have fewer points of view. What about the point of view that you shouldn't, um, vaccinate your children? Um, that's not a point of view. That's incorrect. That's-- Wait, is there an entire planet of anti-vaxxers? Well, they've never technically populated an entire planet. One person gets the measles and the whole planet's gone. I mean, you should see Natashatopia. It's nothing but collared shirts and Twitter feeds. Natasha's not on another planet. She just tweeted about cancer. Oh, honestly, most people on Twitter are actually just citizens of Natashatopia. I mean, haven't you noticed the redundancies? Ugh-- Who's still even on Twitter these days? In Scoutopia, we don't even have smartphones, just portable podcast devices. Huge fan of yours, by the way. Oh my God, you listen to my podcast? Everyone on Scoutopia loves your podcast. Just like we love you. No. If there's one thing all citizens of Scoutopia must agree on it's that there's no such thing as love. Except for self love. That, you can hold on to for forever. Come home with us, Scout. We love you like no one else can. And isn't that what everyone wants in the end?

She doesn't want anything to do -with your bullshit plan, okay? -No, I do. -I do. I want it... -Life is not about surrounding yourself with like-minded individuals. It's about exposing yourself to new perspectives - you never dreamed existed. - Yes, I do. -It's about-- -No. No. Take me to... -Scoutopia. -What? Imagine a world where you didn't have to worry about rape, Ashley. Like, just for starters. Ima-- Imagine never having to have another conversation about the importance of science over belief. Imagine-- Did I mention the entire planet is also gluten-free? It's usually a big draw. Come on, I gotta go there. - If only I live long... - Wait, I have an idea. I knew I kept this for a reason. It's my gum. I can use it to seal the wound. -Stop that. -What is the matter with you? She's going to be fine. There's no such thing as deadly force on Scoutopia. We're not on Scoutopia. We're in my apartment. And your apartment is? -Scoutopia. -A portal to Scoutopia. -A portal to Scoutopia. -I opened it just a minute ago. I thought we were going, and then this happened and so-- but we gotta go now 'cause it will close eventually. Takes a lot of energy and we're very eco-fre-- You know-- I don't have to explain it to you. You've already-- We gotta go. Gotta go. - Okay. - What about me? Oh. Well, I guess... most relationships end. Yeah. I guess they do. Hey, I'm-- I'm really sorry about everything, I-- Don't apologize. Takes away your authority. Good. Maybe-- maybe it's about time someone did. Looks like I was the medium friend all along. Yeah. You were. Oh. I was. -Okay. -Are you ready now? I'm ready. Wait. -I want you to keep Doge. -Okay. So a part of me will always live on. Oh, you can take Doge to Scoutopia. Everyone on that planet has a rescue dog. Literally everyone on the planet is you. -So, they all have a-- -Oh, okay. In that case, bye, guys. -Bye. -Say bye, Doge. Bye. -What's that? -It's the Inuit word for love. Now what? Now it's your turn, biotch. I'm here to take you home, girl. -Who are you? -Wait, wait, I got this. Okay, how much do you know about bees? I'm taking you to Ashleytopia, honey. -Ashleytopia? -Yeah. You know how you feel -about high-low dresses. -Yes. That they're the mullets of evening wear. Imagine a world where they don't even exist. Huh? Imagine a world where cap sleeves are a thing of the past. So, this is what we're doing now? We're all just gonna go to our own planets where everyone has the same beliefs? You're flirting with me right now. Come on, let's go. Okay, I'm not gonna go to an alien planet. I'm not doing it. I'm gonna-- I'm gonna leave the house because I don't have a reason to stay here. But I'm not gonna teleport. -Anywhere. -Bye. It's a-- it's a death machine. I heard about it on a podcast. -Have fun. -Hey, my next ride is here. -You gonna be okay? -I think so. All right, well, if you need me, you know where to find me. And remember, things won't get better unless you demand for them to change. Holy cannoli. Biodegradable gum. -I get to chew gum again. -Check out that gum. Well, this is exciting. I love chewing gum. It's not really the consistency I'm used to. This is not-- Okay. Well, bye, Britney. Thank you, Other Britney. I can get used to this. Oh, I'll get it. Hello? Hi. Sorry, the door was open. Hey. Oh, that's okay. Well, I'm here on behalf of the organization, You Are Not a Loan. We grant micro loans to women-run businesses in the developing world. I was wondering if I could just have a moment of your time. You can have all the moments of my time. Also, uh, what's a micro loan? Really? Oh, uh, yeah. A micro loan is like a macro loan, but smaller, because it's for women. -Well, that's not okay, right? -Yeah. Would you be interested in helping? -I would love to help. -Really? If you'll have me, yes. -Wow, I wasn't expecting this. -Me neither. Yeah, well, uh, do you wanna go door to door with me? -I would love nothing more. -Oh, that's so great. This is such a passionate cause of mine. You know, macro loans, those are too big for women. But if you get a small-- just a small enough amount-- We don't require as much. ♪ I promise I'll stop breaking hearts as soon as they stop ♪ ♪ Making hearts so fragile they can fall apart ♪ ♪ For falling out of love ♪ ♪ Existence is meaningless ♪ ♪ So, let's spend it together ♪ ♪ All of life is a dream ♪ ♪ And all my life I've dreamed of you ♪ ♪ Illusion, do illusion ♪ ♪ Even something solid's mostly spaces in between ♪ ♪ Existence is meaningless ♪ ♪ So, let's spend it together ♪ ♪ Until we don't want to, then we'll walk away ♪ ♪ And we'll wonder why, but there's no reason why ♪ ♪ Until we don't want to see each other no more ♪ ♪ Until the sight of each other is no longer good ♪ ♪ All the love you've had is all the love you'll ever have ♪ ♪ Standing still means walking away ♪ ♪ Love you if I leave, but I hate you if I stay ♪ ♪ Existence is meaningless ♪ ♪ So, let's spend it together ♪ ♪ Until we don't want to, then we'll walk away ♪ ♪ And we'll wonder why, but there's no reason why ♪ ♪ Until we don't want to see each other no more ♪ ♪ Until the sight of each other is no longer good ♪ ♪ I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm ♪ ♪ I promise I'll stop breaking hearts as soon as they stop ♪ ♪ Making hearts so fragile they can fall apart ♪ ♪ For falling out of love ♪ ♪ Existence is meaningless ♪ ♪ And you are meaningless ♪ ♪ I am meaningless ♪ ♪ This chorus is meaningless ♪ ♪ Music is meaningless ♪ ♪ I love you, it's meaningless ♪ ♪ Meaning is meaningless ♪ ♪ This moment is meaningless ♪ ♪ Oh, oh, oh ♪ ♪ Oh, oh, oh ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Oh, oh, oh ♪ ♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh♪
