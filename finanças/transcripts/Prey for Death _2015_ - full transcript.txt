Daddy! Hey, little girl! Come on out! I'm not gonna hurt you! Where're you at? You don't wanna be out in the wilderness all alone? I'll take you to your dad. You want to see your dad, don't you? Daddy! - Bart? - I'll get this one! You just make sure you kill that girl! Oh, I'll get her. You just make sure you get him! Sorry, little lady. We can't have any witnesses. - Daddy, please help me. - You just close your eyes. Turn around, Leia! Put the gun down! You know what happens when you shoot an unarmed man in these parts? - Do your job, Sheriff! - Shut up! - Damn it, listen to me. - I am innocent man! Is this one of the cowboys who killed your wife? Last one. Okay, glad you've found 'em. Now let me take him as my prisoner and you as my witness. Put the gun down, Chamberlain. Put the gun down. You can help me bring him to justice in accord to law. Good man, Chamberlain. Now let him go. Unless I get Donnison, I will not let you go. No, you won't. You'll hang for this. How delightfully rustic. I haven't seen a place this filthy since Calcutta in '54. - Agreed, sir. - Ah, but that's all part of the charm, part of the adventure. Oh good. It looks as somebody's noticed my money. May I introduce you to Baron Charles Emerson of Yorkshire. Good day it is, sir. May I welcome you to Franklin County. We have all the hospitality and comfort you could want. I'm Mayor Cotswell and I am at your service. - It's a pleasure to meet you, sir. - Oh, the pleasure is all mine, good sir. - Now, if I may, you mentioned a hospitality? - Oh yes, we have a hotel, a saloon and a brothel. With just about the sweetest ladies you ever did see. How very inviting. And what of the war? Oh, the war don't come close to us. You have nothing to fear. Oh, I am not afraid of the war, I have seen all of it. But first things first, dear Mayor. I hope you don't mind my saying, but I am wildly attracted by your topper. - My hat? - Indeed. And if I am due acclimate to your culture, 'blend in', so to speak... um, I'm going to need it. Hm. Well, I'll be honest with you, sir. Baron. With this much money, you could buy ten hats. We've a general store in town that sells 'em. Well, I don't need ten hats. I need but one. This one, in particular. My pleasure. Hey, is there anything else we can do for you? Well. yes, I read in the newspapers recently that your Sheriff apprehended a desperado. Oooh yes, we are mighty proud of our sheriff for apprehending that [monstrosity]. We are hanging that murderous Chamberlain character tomorrow. I can get you a seat at the hanging, if you like. Ahh, simple entertainment for good simple people. Mr. Chamberlain claims he murdered those men in self-defense. Now, we got no proof of that, of course. Those men were slaughtered in cold blood. Highly suspect, if you ask me. Now I know why they call this The Wild West. Well, the West has been known for it's outlaws, but we're bringing this to an end here in Franklin county. We're gonna make an example with this Mr. Chamberlain. I am sure that there are truer words that have never been spoken, dear Mayor. - Now, about that brothel? - Well, right this way. Your Chinaman will have to stay out back in the alley, of course. Bet you. Hi, baby. I'm here to serve notice to you, Mr. Chamberlain. According to the laws of this state, it is you stand convicted of murder your daughter is to be placed in the custody of the Mission Orphanage. No. No, you - you can't take my daughter, please. You get to be hanged tomorrow, Mr. Chamberlain. At least you got a fair trial, unlike the men you murdered. Those men killed my wife and were going to kill my daughter, if I did not get to them first. The sheriff didn't believe you, the jury didn't believe you and the judge didn't believe you. And even if I did, it wouldn't make any difference. My job is to serve notice, I've done that. - Say goodbye to your father, child. - Daddy, don't let her take me. When Mommy went to heaven, you promised me that we would always be together. - It's time to go. - No, wait. Wait! Prolonging this is pointless. - Daddy, don't leave me. - You gonna be okay, baby. I promise. I love you so much. Okay now. Come along. - Good day, sir. - I present Baron Charles Emerson of Yorkshire. Always a pleasure to meet a law man. Can I help you folks with something? Of all the places I've been, this Wild West of yours intrigues me the most. You have everything, from gunslingers to grizzly bears. You have the noble savage Indian, you have a virgin frontier. You have a lust for gold, for women. And for whiskey. And above all else, you have lawlessness. And that, my new colleague friend, is what brings me here today. You are looking for... lawlessness? No, no. But I am looking for an outlaw. And if I understand it correctly, you currently have one in your custody. A particularly ruthless example. You name the half of it, let me tell you. - Is he dangerous? - And how. He killed four men. Killed a couple of them fellas with his bare hands. I can let you have a look at him, for two bits. Or you just wait till tomorrow noon and see him swing for free. Ahhh! You're a businessman. How [fortunate] it is, for I have a proposition for you. A very lucrative one. A propo... A pro... - What exactly are you getting at? - I would like to pay you money. You want to pay me? For what? - I would like to pay you 500 $. - Five hundred? All you have to do is to turn your back for a few minutes. Turn my back? To what? Your prisoner. I need him. - You want me to give you the prisoner? - No, no, no. I want you to turn your back and think of all the ways you'll spend your money I'll take the prisoner myself. He's supposed to be hanged tomorrow. And I'll lose my job. And just how much do you earn on this, um... job? Two dollars a week. So I am willing to pay you... five years of your wages. And all you have to do, is to close your eyes for two minutes. That's a... rather large raise. But I won't have my badge no more. You can tell everyone you fought validly against us. We won't say a word. And you may even emerge from this a hero. You think people are gonna believe... that an old guy... and a Chinaman... ...roughed up Buford M. Wallace? ...and rode off with his prisoner? It's gonna be pretty hard to believe... mister. - I present Baron Charles... - Not necessary, my boy. He and I shall speak here as equals. How do you do, Mr. Chamberlain? My name is Charles. I've come a long way to meet you. Mmm, quite an impressive specimen, wouldn't you agree? - No sir, not to me. - Oh come now lad, don't be rude. Look to ferocity in his eye. Like that of a lion. I've hunted a lion, a huge male, on the Serengeti, in my early years. It's speed and strength proved less... formidable than my own skills. As a matter of fact, it was a rather easy kill. I'm curious to find out whether you'll will [...] better. I can see in your eyes you're already parting an escape. And that you would heavily kill both me and my valet in order to achieve it. Oh, I admire that. It confirms one of the reasons I've sought you out in the first place. However, I can assure you that will be totally unnecessary, for when we have concluded our conversation here, I and my valet will free you from your chains and we'll spirit you out of here. Say again? Ahh... so you DO understand me? My friend, I am a hunter. I have hunted all the great beasts of the world, from the lion to the elephant, from panther to the Kodiak bear. And I have killed them all. But alas... they were all too easy. Never once that I experienced the thrill of my own mortality. So I took the next logical step. I began hunting... people. But not just any people, really, really, no, I... began to target the world's great warriors. I killed a mighty Maori in New Zealand. A ferocious Sikh in the sweltering Punjab. Even a fearsome Zulu or two on the plains of Southern Africa. Let me show you this. This... was [...] upon me by a Samurai. Do you know what a Samurai is? The Samurai, are the most incredible warriors. Intensely trained, highly skilled, devilously clever and quick. The one I hunted almost killed me. Oh, it was a gruesome, bloody fight to the death. But... as you can see, it was I who prevailed at the end. The point is... ...I have traveled far and wide to hunt some of the world's greatest warriors. And now I'm here for you. The great Western Desperado, the ruthless outlaw, who can kill men with his bare hands. Is it just me or is the air fresher at this altitude? I divert at your judgment, sir. I believe it is! And it has just inspired me, Kowloon. How so, sir? Perhaps after this adventure we should travel to Nepal. The mountains there are even higher than these. There's a mountain range there called 'The Kangchenjunga'. I believe it would make for a challenging hunting ground. If you say so, sir. I knew it! Just as I predicted. He is taking the north side down, instead of the eastern side, which is considerably easier. This means he understands what is happening and he's using tactical thinking in order to elude me. What a promising beginning. Let's get going, Kowloon. Don't dawdle. Ahh, you see? He thinks my little gift might be a trap. He doesn't know me. He may think I'm just out for the kill, but it's the hunt! The hunt that is everything. I am fair with my prey... ...one thing I am not, however... is patient. That was just a warning shot, Mr. Chamberlain. But now try havoc! You might have hit me, if hadn't been informed as to the range of your weapon! Why do you think I'm standing so far back? However, I am also informed as to the extreme range of my rifle! This is getting VERY interesting. That's what life is all about. A fair fight, a leveled playing field. Kowloon, we are switching to revolver. Let me have no advantage. Stay in good cover, Kowloon. I count six, Mr. Chamberlain. You - are out of ammunition. I - am not. Kowloon! That was exhilarating! Now please hand me my rifle. And be so kind as to reload that. Nothing feels better than existing EXACTLY the way we were meant to. I never feel more live than when I'm on my hunt! I noticed that, sir. And have you noticed this? These tracks remain steady in one general direction. It's only a cause when one knows where one is headed. Could it be he is familiar with this terrain? It's possible we didn't take him far enough away from town. So based on what you know, Kowloon, what would you say our chances are? I never bet against you, sir. A fine sentiment, but this is not about gambling. It is about education, observe this hunt closely. For it may be a value to you one day. Well! Off we go. Regrettably, my boy, it makes fools of us all. But it's not over. We'll split out. I continue to follow his tracks, and you flank him... from the North. He is likely exhausted as well. If you spot him... fire this. Into the air. The kill is mine, remember. Guns are for old men and women. We are neither. You know how to fight like a man. Yes, I do. - So you don't like guns? - No. Guns are for cowards. Didn't your people invent gunpowder? The Baron thinks highly of your skill as a warrior. I don't. I don’t take kindly to trespassers here. Put your hands up. Kowloon? Oh, no. Please don't be dead, for I will never be able to forgive you. Forgive me for what, sir? For dying before you have truly lived, my boy. I met Mr. Chamberlain. He wanted to leave and I he should stay. - You were late, sir. - My apologies, I lost the trail. Briefly. So... you fought? Yes. So now he is dead? Well, I specifically reserved the pleasure to kill to myself! - He's alive and... fairly well, sir. - How is that possible? He cheated. He threw a rock at me. A rock? But that's just simply not cricket! But... that would explain your current discomfort. - It would explain your mistake. - My mistake? Yes, you assumed you were fighting a civilized man. Not a barbarian who makes up his own rules as he goes along. But - no harm done. Except you, of course. One day you may thank Mr. Chamberlain for this encounter. 'Cause we learn more from our failures than our successes. This has made you smarter, stronger and deadlier. - Do you understand? - I do, sir. Good. Well... ...now that you're alive and... sufficiently rested... ...I want you to set up camp here for the night. The hunt will resume on tomorrow. In earnest. We don't get many visitors here in these parts. We? Okay, I don't get many visitors. You here alone? No, I'm here with my friend. Winchester. Oh... I took you gun. You didn't have any ammunition, anyway. Any men folk around here? The war took my brother and my father. Husband? The war didn't take him. He... left. On his own. You got any children? Not that is any of your business... No. That's why my husband left. I'm sorry to hear that. Don't be. Mind if I join you at the table? What are you doing here, in the middle of nowhere? Are you running from the law? Something worse. How can I help you? Water. Kowloon! One should never pass up the opportunity to admire something like this. But, sir, the hunt? If we should let something, as magnificent as this, pass our gaze without notice, we should rightly be called joyless. We are merely out for a kill, that will make us no better than the animals. But we better ourselves with the hunt. By challenging and defeating a worthy opponent, we improve ourselves. Experiencing joy is a part of that process. Understood, sir. Now. Did we bring along that old whiskey that we procured in Scotland? - Yes, sir. - And what does that whiskey prove? That even the Scottish aren't completely useless? You learn very well. Now, be a good lad and pour me a small shot. - Breakfast? - Thank you. - You got a lot of nice tools here. - Yes, my father was a blacksmith. - Do you know 'to use them? - My grandfather taught me how. It's a shame they are going to waste now. This place is a paradise. It could be. You know, you could stay here for a few days. Just... long enough to regain your strength. I wish I could. I really do. You got someone waiting on you? - Yes, ma'am. - Um... special someone? Yes, ma'am. I was thinking... you know, you could use some extra time. but, um... I've been alone for a long time. And I'm used to it. Oh, your gun. I have some extra ammo, so I loaded it for you. Go on, take it. There he is... Prepare yourself, Kowloon, the chase is about to resume. What is this? It seems that for the first time we may have a surrender on our hands. I may have misjudged this Western warrior. So did I once. Hold there. Do I surmise that you acquiesce to my superior skill and tenacity? Hell no. What the devil are you doing? A sense of fair play does have it's limits. I say we end this here. Now. I see. And how exactly do you propose to accomplish that? You and me, man to man. Pistols. Until it's done. A duel? Kowloon, this hunt has suddenly started to exceed my wildest expectations. What are the Western rules? Unholster your weapon fast, and aim true. Simple enough. Very well. I find your terms to be very... agreeable. Would you allow me, on your honor, to... properly equip myself? I admire this man, Kowloon. So much solve it. I believe that I must kill him now. Excellent. Take cover, Kowloon. That shouldn't be... but a moment. It seems I have been bested at last, Kowloon... But do not... despair... for I have lived my life. - I have... truly lived. - I don't know what I'll do. Nonsense, I've taught you well. And I... am prepared for the unexpected. In my... pocket... you will find my... legal will. I leave all my remaining wealth... to you. Use it wisely. Improve yourself... always. Never stop advancing, you hear?! [...]. Oh, Baron, don't leave. No trouble, my boy. I'm merely [...] face another adventure. The greatest... one of all. - Okay, is everybody here? - Buford, where's the sheriff? He went to County-C, for court day. He even know you pulled up a posse? - He left me in charge, didn't he? Seems strange leave you in charge after you lost that one prisoner. I didn't lose anybody. His gang came, took him from me. I'm a hired gun, ain't gonna do this for no pay. You're gonna get paid. And don't forget I overlooked the fact that you're a deserter. Did your time, my ass. You jumped two feet when you saw my badge yesterday. Don't forget I know something about every man here. Does anybody else want to shoot off your mouth? I didn't think so. What's the plan? Chamberlain's gonna try to sneak in here, all quiet-like. To slip away with his little girl before anyone knows he's here. Here comes Mrs. Habishaw from the orphanage. - She has our bait. - But ain't it wrong to use a man's kid as bait? Ain't it wrong to gun people down in cold blood? - That man is wanted for murder. - Mr. Wallace. Did I just hear one of your men refer to this innocent child? - As bait? - He didn't mean nothing like. I should hope not. Have your men been drinking? No more than normal - for a man who's put his life on the line. Oh, liquored at, waiting for a gunfight? I closed the streets off. You shouldn't even be here, Mrs. Habishaw. In case you've forgotten, you were the one who told us to be here. Alright, why don't you go wait at the office, then? Go in the back, no stray bullet should get you there. Come on now, [...]. - You know why I'm here. - Oh, I know a lot of things. Don't you mess with me, Buford. I want my daughter. I want to take her out of here. We all live. I know you got those men with you. And if you try anything, as God is my witness, I will kill every last one of you sons o'bitches. So what's it gonna be, Buford? Just you and me. Who is that? An army deserter. Came here yesterday. No, it's not. It's a famous outlaw, Chamberlain. You got him. He killed your posse when you killed him. I killed him? - But what about... - Well, congratulations, Deputy. Looks like you have been a hero when everyone [...]. Most everyone. Bet you'll even get a reward. But you make damn sure he's buried put, when Sheriff gets back. And do it yourself, do you hear? Daddy, who is that? Is this the special someone you told me about? Yeah, this is my daughter Leia. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. I was wondering if you still needed that blacksmith? Oh, it is not a temporary position.
