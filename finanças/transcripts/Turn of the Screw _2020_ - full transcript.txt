Hello? Is anyone there? Ah, you've arrived! Julia? We spoke on the phone. Nice to meet you. The pleasure is ours. Trust me. Thank God you've arrived! We were getting worried. Sorry. My flight from Auckland got delayed but it did give me more time to work on my lines. I'm sorry we didn't have someone to come and pick you up. Oh, that's fine I just got an Uber. Well, the important thing is you're here now. However, it does mean we're very short on time tonight. We're going to have to start straight away if you don't mind. Oh, of course! You are able to perform off book? We open tomorrow night. Yes, I spent all last night and today cramming my lines and I've also studied your stage directions. Excellent! Who needs sleep, eh? This will be your chance tonight to get a real feel for everything. An unofficial dress rehearsal just for you! You can leave your things here. Since it's so late, most of the stage crew have gone home. But since your character is on stage for the whole play that shouldn't be too much of an issue for you. That's fine. There'll be some lights and sound and some minimal props and sets. All the other actors have been able to stay light apart from... just two. So you'll have to work around that. Just do the best you can. Improvise. Of course. I'll work around anything you need me to. I really appreciate this opportunity. Let me just run you through the staging. Have you been in this theater before? No, it's my first time here. Built in 1913. Mainly for opera, but they allow us poor thespians to use it occasionally. It's very grand! As you know from your stage notes, most of the locations take place in a different part of the stage. The walls and props will drop down when needed and disappear again when they're not. But you won't see any of that because it all happens in darkness. Each location will light up when it's time for that scene and you just follow the light to that area. Got it. Shit! What was that? Don't worry. That's another major thing to be aware of. Our sound system. We have a major new sound effects system installed for this production. It creates a total immersion sound experience. So what we heard right now wasn't real? Okay! I got it. Turn on the city traffic. And just like that we're transported to the 1890s! It's so lifelike. Exciting, isn't it? Give us the storm. We have more subtle sound effects. More gentle breezes, birds tweeting. And a few more for emotive effect. This is after all... a horror story. Of course. I think it's great. It'll add so much... atmosphere for the audience. Not just the audience, Julia. It affects all the performers as well. Takes things to the next level. You'll see. Oh, shit. Look at the time, it's after 11:00. We really need to get started. Look don't worry about your costume tonight. We'll sort all that out tomorrow Do you need a glass of water? No, I'm fine to begin. Well. Break a leg. See you at the interval. Richard? Yes. The actress I'm replacing... Is she all right? Yes, she's fine and doing well. We're all hopeful she'll make a full recovery. If you don't mind me asking, what happened? She had a breakdown. Right here last night. That's terrible! Yes, it was very sudden. We've all been working a lot of long hours but no one saw it coming. But she's recovering now. She's the second actress to come down sick. Is that right? Yes, we've had a bit of bad luck there. Well, what happened? Look, don't stress yourself about any of that. Just focus on the very good fortune for you, Julia. Your big break! Your first starring role! Many is the great career that's begun when the understudy took their chance. Wow the critics tomorrow night and you'll be on your way. But first we need to get through tonight. We'll begin in just a moment. All the best. Oh, Richard? The two I just couldn't say like tonight... Which roles are they? So, this would be your first governess position? Yes, sir. How old are you? I'm 24, sir. And what of marriage? In the near future have you any suitors? No, sir. Good. I wouldn't want the children to become attached and then you decide to leave. I agree, sir. Security and continuity are vital to a child's development. I would never do anything to jeopardize that. My lifestyle here in the city is not one that could suitably be shared with children. So, the children do not live with you? No, they are at my country estate in Bly. A rather large, lonely place. Still, I'm sure you will agree that the country is the proper place for children. I do, sir. And the children are both orphans? Yes, their parents died whilst overseas two years ago. Little Miles and Flora now have only me and they need much more than just a distant Uncle. They need someone to truly love and care for them. Can you be that person to Miles and Flora? Surely there must be far more qualified applicants than me? Yes, there have been other applicants. But Bly is not the most attractive location for many people. It really is in the middle of nowhere. Not another living soul for miles around. And those applicants who weren't put off by the location were either unsuitable or wouldn't accept my other terms. In particular, my main condition. Which is? That you must never troubled me. Never, ever! Neither appeal, nor complain, nor write. Just take the whole thing over and leave me alone. What do you say? If the children have been orphans these past two years, they must have had another governess previously? Yes, a Miss Jessel. An excellent governess. The children adored her. Especially Flora. So, why isn't Miss Jessel still with you? She died. It was very sudden. I was away when it happened and I have only now been able to seek a replacement. Meantime, Miles has been sent off to a boarding school and little Flora has been looked after by my housekeeper, Mrs. Grose. A very good woman whose been with my family many years. But she is not at all qualified for a young lady's upbringing and education. Take the position. Give Miles and Flora the love and affection that they deserve. Only remember that you are in charge. Complete charge. And no matter what happens, you must handle it alone. Not a word to me. Ever. Who's there? Boo! Goodness! You scared me! I'm sorry, Miss. I just couldn't resist. We love games here. You must be Flora. I'm your new governess, Miss.. I know. We've been waiting for you. What were you looking at, Miss? Oh, I just I thought I saw something in the tower up there. There's no one up there, Miss. Not ever. Since Uncle wrote, we've all been waiting for you. Mrs Grose is nearly as excited as me. She's cleaned and cleaned. Mrs Grose! She's here! I'm glad to see you, Miss. Really I am. Thank you. You're very kind. I expect you'd like a cup of tea? That would be lovely. Please, come in. Flora, it's getting late. Go and wash up before bedtime. Do I have to, Miss? I want to stay up. Now, now. Do as Mrs Grose says. Yes, Miss. The house and grounds are very impressive. We do our best, Miss. Though half the rooms are empty now. It's a job to keep the whole place clean. Please, do sit down. Flora loves it here. There's never a shortage of places for her to explore. What an enchanting child she is! There's not another like her. And the little boy... Miles. Is he too so very remarkable? Oh most remarkable, Miss. If you think well of this one you'll be carried away by the little gentleman! I'm rather easily carried away. I confess I was carried away in town. Their Uncle is most persuasive. You're not the first Miss and you won't be the last. I have no pretension of being the only one. Even as a boy the master could twist you round his little finger. And the children, they're just the same. He doesn't visit here often? The master prefers the town life. He would be very bored down here with just me and the children. Mrs. Grose. Yes, Miss. Is there anyone else living here that I should know about? Living here? In the house. I was wondering if perhaps there were any other people I needed to meet? I wish there were! We could use another pair of hands. Young Miles, as I understand, arrives back soon? Yes. School holidays begin tomorrow. Miles arrives on the afternoon train. What the Hell was that? Are you all right, Miss? Yes... I'm fine. I just got a shock. It was just a baby. Did you have to kill it? It was wounded, Miss. The kindest thing to do. How strange... Perhaps it was confused by the sunset. Has anything like this ever happened before? No, never. Just bad luck. Sit down, Miss. Please, have some more tea. I'll dispose of this and fetch us some lamps. It's getting dark. It's Flora's bedtime. She's come to say good night. Do I really have to go to bed, Miss? Yes, Flora. But I'll be up to see you very soon. I'm so glad we're sharing a room together. So am I. Promise you won't go away. No indeed. I'm not going anywhere. Now you run along. I'll be up to see you very soon. Good night, dear. And to think what qualms I had about coming here. I was so afraid. Afraid, Miss? I couldn't make up my mind. Should I accept this position or not? Well, I'm very glad you did, Miss. Mrs Grose. Yes, Miss. The other governess... The one before me who died. What was she like? She was a young lady about your age. Some thought her pretty and I suppose she was. But not as pretty as you, Miss. Not by half! He seems to prefer them young and pretty. Oh, he did. He had the devil's own eye. I mean that was his way. The Master's. But of whom did you speak first? Why the master of course. There's nobody else. Nobody at all. Now I lay me down to sleep. I pray the Lord my soul to keep. If I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take. Amen. Mrs Grose wanted to give you a big room on your own. But I said we should share. I am very pleased to be sharing with you. Big rooms get bigger at night. Do you know that? Do they? Mrs Grose doesn't know. She shuts her eyes in the dark. I think that's silly. I always look in the dark. And what do you see? Can I ask you something, Miss? Yes, of course dear. If I did die, where would the Lord take my soul to? To Heaven of course. Are you certain? Yes, because you're a very good girl. But I might not be. And if I weren't, then wouldn't the Lord just leave me here to walk around? Isn't that what happens to some people? What was that? I'm sure someone's being hurt! An animal. We must pretend we didn't hear it. That's what Mrs Grose says. Pretend? Then we can't imagine things. Sometimes we can't help imagining things. Hello? Mrs Grose? Mrs Gross shit Goodness, you scared me! What are you doing in here? I thought I heard something in here. It'll just be mice or rats. No one's used this room in years. Do you know much about all of this? Everything in this room was before my time. We must get to bed Miss or we'll be sleepwalking all day tomorrow. Of course. You go to bed and I'll just put things back as I found them. Very well, Miss. Good night. Good night, Mrs Grose. A letter has arrived for you, Miss. Thank you, Mrs Grose. It's from your Uncle. From Uncle? Yes. Is he coming for a visit? No dear. He's just forwarding a letter from Miles's school. Mrs Grose! What's the matter, Miss? Nothing, dear. You go back to your reading. Yes, Miss? This is a letter from Miles's school. What's the matter? Is everything all right? Miles has been dismissed. Dismissed? Expelled. He may not return after the holidays. What on earth has he done? The school goes into no particulars. They simply say it is impossible to keep him. That can only have one meaning... That he is the threat to the other students. Master Miles a threat? It's dreadful to say such cruel things. He scarcely ten years old. This is very concerning. I'm not sure what to do. See him first, Miss. And then believe. You might as well believe it of the little lady! The last governess... Miss. Jessel. Did she see anything in the boy? That wasn't right? She never mentioned anything to me. And you've never known Miles to be...bad? No, I I don't pretend that. Then you have known him... To be naughty. Yes miss. Like any boy. But not to the degree to... contaminate? To? To corrupt? To corrupt? No! Are you afraid he might corrupt you, Miss? Oh, goodness! We must get ready to pick Miles up. Flora come along and get ready. We're going to the train station. Are you ready, Miss? We really must be going. That wasn't you who just screamed was it? Screamed? No. Flora? Did either of you hear it? A woman's scream? It was awful! The most anguished sound I've ever heard. Are you certain, Miss? I'm sure we would have heard it too. Perhaps you were confused by something- No! I'm sorry. But no. I don't see how I could have... Also, twice, up on the tower- We really must be going or we'll be late for Miles. Miles! How you've grown! This is your new governess. How do you do, Miles. How do you do, Miss. Let's get you home, Miles. It's all the same. Somehow, I don't know, I was afraid it might be different. Nothing ever changes here. Well, Miss? It's just as you told me. Charm does seem to be the family trait. And that cruel charge? It doesn't live an instant. My dear a woman, look at him! I assure you I do nothing else, Miss. What will you say then? In answer to the letter? Nothing. And to his Uncle? Nothing. And the boy himself? Nothing. Then I'll stand by you, Miss. We'll see this out. We'll see this out! Would you mind, Miss, if I...? What a comfort you are. Dear Mrs Grose! What was it that was troubling you earlier, Miss? You said you saw something? It was nothing. I didn't sleep at all last night and I think my tired mind was playing tricks. Miles shouldn't be sitting on the grass and has good trousers. Come along, Miles. Let's get you changed. Are you all right, dear? Oh yes, Miss. It is so good to have Miles home. We should probably be getting you changed as well. Oh, please Miss. Can I stay outside just a few more minutes? I can do some more reading. All right then. But just a few minutes. Flora! Come here! What's going on, Miss? Nothing, dear. Everything is fine. Flora, sit at the table and finish your reading there. Please. Flora! Flora!. Are you all right? Yes, Miss. A man! There was a man in here a moment ago. I saw him through the window! A man? Yes, a man! He was standing right here. No, Miss. No one has come in. You were only gone a few seconds. Are you unwell, Miss? No, dear. Everything's fine. I just thought that I had... It doesn't matter. I'm sorry for worrying you. Can you go and call Mrs Grose for me, dear? Then go get ready for bed. Yes, Miss. You wanted me, Miss? Goodness, you're very pale! What's the matter? Mrs. Grose, I've seen two other people here at Bly. Who? First it was a man standing in the steeple tower. I've seen them twice up there. In the tower...? Yes. First he was hiding in the shadows. Then later he was just standing there looking straight at me. And just before I saw him in this very room. As close to me as you are now. What did he look like? He is dressed like a gentleman? Although I do not for a moment believe he is one. He has long dark hair and the coldest, hardest eyes. And dressed like a gentleman, you say? But definitely not one. Mrs Grose. Do you know who this man is? The man you're describing sounds like... Quint. Quint? Peter Quint. He was the valet to the master. When the master returned to town, Quint remained. He lived here? Alone with us. He was in charge for a time. And then? He left. Left to where? He died, Miss. Peter Quint is dead. This cannot be... How? Out there, Miss. He died out there on that very lawn. It was winter. The coldest, darkest winter's night. The steps were icy. And Quint... He must have come home late and full of drink. There was a wound to his head as if he'd slipped and fallen in the dark. I can't forget his eyes. They were open, full of pain. Rather like the eyes of a fox I once saw. A fox the dogs had hunted down. But it was... an accident? He was a peculiar man. There were things in his life that might account for violence done him. But it doesn't do to speak ill of the dead. You said you've seen people, Miss. Who else have you seen? A woman. Dressed all in black. She was in the garden before when Flora and I were out there. She wanted Flora. Wanted Flora? She came for the child? Came with this determination that was... indescribable. I grabbed Flora before she could get to her! This woman is evil. She scares me even more than that man does. And the lady was dressed in black, you say? Dressed as if in morning, yes. The dress looks exactly like the one that I found last night in the box room. And you've never seen this woman before today? No. But I suspect that you have. Miss Jessel? Miss Jessel. Mrs Grose, what do you know that you're not telling me? That's Miles's room. I'll go to him. But then we must talk further. Come in, Miss. How did you know I was there? I saw your light under the door. You ought to be asleep. I'm too excited! Excited? By being home. By meeting you. Tell me about your term at school. How was it? Let's not talk about school. It already feels very far away. Miles look at me. You know you have been dismissed from your school. You will not be allowed to go back. I need to know, Miles. Why has the school taken this action? Does it really matter? Of course it matters! This is not something we can ignore. I must know the reason. Then you'll have to ask the school. I can't tell you what they think. Miles, that will not do. Surely they would have told you. But they didn't! Very well. I had hoped to handle this myself. But if you can't or won't help me I shall have to write to your Uncle and tell him. Go ahead. Not that he'll pay me attention. He never does. I don't suppose he cares much about me or Flora. Miles, dear. You mustn't believe that. Your Uncle has many responsibilities. And not enough time to... ...waste any on us. I understand. But it's a little sad when people don't have time for you. I have time for you, Miles. And I do care. Very much! If there's something wrong. If there's anything you want to tell me? No, there's nothing. Goodnight, Miss. And that's intermission! Excellent first half. Well done, Julia. Well done! You really have studied those lines. Thanks. Is that what you were expecting? You know that was nothing like what I was expecting. There's different dialogue, different actions. I'm completely lost most of the time! Well, it doesn't show. You didn't tell me everything would be this different. Exactly. You're exploring new territory as an actor. Which is great! Look, we're all having to adapt tonight. I told you not everyone could stay late. But trust me. Everything is working fine. I'm sorry, Richard. I just really don't feel comfortable with what's happening right now. I see. Would you like me to ring your agent and tell them you're struggling on the first day of your big break? No. I'll continue. This is all just very new to me. You're improvising beautifully and coming up with things that I haven't seen in any other rehearsal. Just trust your instincts and keep going with it. Look, it's after midnight and we really need to press on. Okay? Sure. Oh, Richard? Yes? The other actresses who played my role... Yes, what about them? Did they ever claim to see things with the ghosts that were... different? Not what they expected? Also, I'm still not getting which- Julia! It's been a fucking long day for all of us. We just need to get through the next act and then we can let everyone else go home. When we've finished Act Two, I can go over all the questions and notes you want. But, right now, we just need to keep going. All right? Of course. And don't worry. Everything is working just fine. Trust me. Children! No talking. Finish your study. Are you all right, Miss? I'm fine. I just haven't been sleeping very well. You're very warm, Miss. Flora, sit back down and finish your work. Poor Miss. We're being naughty. Aren't we? No, of course not. Oh, dear. What a grumpy governess you have. You're not grumpy at all. Is she Miles? Of course she isn't. Let's entertain her, Flora. No, children I'm fine. Why don't you go off and play? Enough study for one day. Oh, children. Only play inside. You're not to stay outdoors. But it's such a nice day. Inside only and stay together. Those are my conditions for finishing early. Understood? Yes, Miss. Yes, Miss. Thank you, Miss. You've let the children off their studies early, Miss? Yes. I'm far too distracted right now to be a very good teacher. Put last night behind you, Miss. I know what I've seen, Mrs Grose. That man. That woman! Looking at me from their graves. You're upsetting yourself over nothing. Mrs Grose, I appreciate you not wanting to speak ill of the dead. But I must have it now. What was between Quint and Miss Jessel? There was everything between them. A relationship? But Miss Jessel was a lady? She was a lady. But she was infamous. They were both infamous. In spite of the difference...? In their class and rank? It didn't matter. Quint did as he wished. She was in love with him? Love. I suppose she called it that. It was more like a sickness. A fever that leaves the body dry and burned out. The children... They haven't mentioned Quint or Miss Jessel once since I arrived? No. And neither must you, Miss. You see it was Miles who found Quint dead. The poor little boy... If you could have heard his screams. Seen the way he clung to him, begging him to speak! He worshipped Quint. Worshipped that man? Miles? And who can blame him? A lonely boy with no Father. No other the men around... Quint took advantage of him. It made me sick to see young Miles trotting around after him like a little dog. They were always together. Couldn't you have intervened? Forbade the two from being together? I wasn't in charge. The master placed Quint here. And besides... Besides? No one could stand against Quint. You didn't know him, Miss. Such power he had over people... But Miss Jessel... Couldn't she have done something? Miss Jessel. Deep down there was no difference between them. She had Flora and Quint had Miles. I must go to Flora. I don't know what you've seen Miss. But Miss Jessel and Quint are gone. Dead. There's no point in reliving things that are over and done with. Miles! Hello, Miss. Have you been looking for me? You should be with Flora. How long have you been up here? Not long. Only a minute or two. Then you must have seen him? Who? The man who was with you just before. I've been quite alone. That can't be true. Just a minute ago I saw... Perhaps it was just me you saw. No. There were two people here. A minute ago? Right here? Yes. Then you must have imagined it. What are you doing up here, Miles? I told you both not to play outside. Why did you disobey me? So that you might think me, for a change, bad. And how could you be sure that I would find you? Oh, I arranged that with Flora. She distracted Mrs Grose, and whenever you're alone you always look up here. It was easy. So what are you doing up here, Miles? Not much. Just thinking. Thinking about what? This strange business of ours. What strange business, Miles? Why, about you, Miss. We're all very concerned about you. You don't need to worry about me, Miles. I'm just a bit tired that's all. I know. Do you? Flora told me. She said you toss and turn all night. Of course, one never knows whether beleieve Flora. She invents things. Just like me? Well, you won't be bothered with me for much longer. We will get you back to school soon but not the old one. We'll find you a new one. A better one. You've never said a word to me about your school. Never mentioned it in any way. Haven't I? No, never. From the hour you came back, you've never mentioned one of your masters or one of your friends. Nor the least little thing that ever happened to you there. You seem to just perfectly accept the present. I don't. I don't accept anything! Miles, please. Is there nothing you want to tell me? What happened before? Before what? Before you went away and before you came back? What happened? If you only knew how I want to help you. I'd rather die than give you a pain or do your wrong. I just want to help you. It's getting late, Miss. What did Flora want earlier when she called you? Oh,, it was nothing Miss. Just something she said she'd lost. It was a trick. She and Miles had planned to separate us. She lied to you. Oh, now Miss. I've never known either of the children to lie. Why would they? Why? Because they are both playing, or being made to play, some monstrous game. I can't pretend to understand its purpose. I only know it's happening. Believe me. The children are in dreadful danger. But from whom? Who do you think? From Quint and Miss Jessel! What you're saying, Miss, it's terrifying. I know it's hard to accept that this house is poisoned. That the children are a pair of calculating liars. That they have friends who would scare them out of their wits if they weren't deeply and forever bound to them. You really believe these ghosts are in contact with the children? But what are we to do? Then you do believe me? You don't think I'm imagining it? I believe you, Miss. Thank you, Mrs Grose! I've been so frightened. I felt so alone but with you to help me... Of course I'll help you, Miss. If you'll just tell me how. First, we must understand what these horrors want from the children. Think, Mrs Grose. The answer must be in the past. It hurts me to remember. There are things I'm ashamed to say. Go on. Poor Miss Jessel. There was no indignity she wouldn't suffer for that man. No shame. No pride. Crawl to him she would. On her knees. And him laughing at her. He had such a savage laugh. And the children? I can't say, Miss. I don't know what the children saw. But they used to follow Quint and Miss Jessel everywhere. Trail behind them. Holding hands and whispering. There was too much whispering in this house, Miss. What happened to Miss Jessel? After Quint died, she went into the blackest mourning. She grieved and grieved till there was madness in her eyes. I used to hear her all over the house wondering, sobbing... Screaming? Yes, and screaming. It was horrible. It couldn't go on. Finally, she died. The black mourning dress that I found... That was Miss Jessel's, wasn't it? She wore it every day after Quint died. I have to be Flora. She cannot be alone at all tonight. We'll discuss our plans in the morning. Good night, Mrs Grose. Flora? Flora? Miles! Where is she? Who? Your sister! You were looking out there. Is that where Flora is? Of course. Why is she out here tonight, Miles? Why are you both out here? I was waiting for you again, Miss. When you couldn't find Flora inside, you'd have to come out here eventually. And why is she out here tonight? Because she needed for you to not be with her tonight. And so, I helped her. Why would you do that? When I'm bad, Miss, I am bad. Mrs Grose! Mrs Grose! Mrs Grose, I need you outside. Now! Good gracious, Miss. What on earth is going on? Flora has disappeared. I can't find her. She must be inside. Surely she wouldn't be out here in this terrible fog. She's out there. With her! I must go and find her. But I need you to stay with Miles. He is not to leave your sight. Understood? Yes, Miss. Go inside. Now. Flora? Flora, where are you? Flora? Flora, are you all right? What's the matter? Flora, I need you to get up and come with me. Right now. Mrs Grose! Open the door! Mrs Grose! Open the door! Good heavens, Miss! What is the matter? The door was locked. I'm sorry. I was upstairs with Miles. It doesn't matter. Where is Miles now? He's in his bedroom and I've locked the door. He can't go anywhere. Flora, what are you doing outside? She was meeting her! Miss! Let me hear it from Flora. Flora, who were you meeting out here? Nobody. Don't lie to us! Where has she gone? Who? Miss Jessel, Flora! Where has Miss Jessel gone? Let her go, Miss! You're hurting her! Where is she, Flora? Where is she? Miss! Let her go! There! Look, Flora, look! There's no pretending you can't see that! Right there! Tell me her name. What woman? Are you telling me you don't see her? I don't believe you. She's right there, you silly girl. There! There! There! You can see her as well as you see me! Please, Miss. Stop this! Look, Mrs Grose, look! You can see. You must! She's as big as a blazing fire! Only look dearest woman. Look! I don't know what she means. I see nobody. Nothing! I never have. I know, dear. Nobody's there. Nobody ever was. How could you see Miss Jessel when poor Miss Jessel is dead and buried. You're cruel! You're wicked! I hate you! Take me away from her. Please! I am left with no choice. Their Uncle must be told everything. He must be forced to understand. Understand what exactly, Miss? Everything. Everything that has happened. I know what you claim to have seen... And is Flora still claiming not to have seen? She says there was no one there. Except you. And you pretended to believe her? I didn't have to pretend. You know that. Perhaps if I spoke to her- No! You're not to go near her. She hates you. And quite frankly, I can understand why. Flora was a sweet and innocent child. A happy child until you made her face that- That woman! That bad memory. You are to take Flora to her Uncle this morning. Away from me and away from them. And leave you here alone? Except for Miles. I was with him yesterday in the tower. He didn't say anything but he wanted to. He wanted to reveal himself to me and and ask for my help. I must give him the chance. You do understand? No, Miss. After last night, I doubt he'll ever understand you. It was a cruel thing you did to Flora. And if you're planning another cruelty... To wake a child out of a bad dream. Is that cruelty? Sometimes waking a child can be worse than any bad dream. You're wrong. You're talking nonsense. You and Flora are to leave this morning. That is my decision. Tonight. I must be alone here with Miles. But Miss- You mustn't miss the train. Go and pack for your journey. Yes, Miss. It's 8 o'clock, Miss. Are you getting tired, Miles? No, not at all. I like having tea just with you. How very grown up. Yes. We can talk properly now. Like two adults. Why did you send the others away? Are you afraid? What makes you think that I am afraid, Miles? I'm not a mind reader, but I sense things. But don't worry. No need to be afraid. There's a man in the house. Is there? Yes, it's me. I'll protect you. It'll be fun. We have the whole house to ourselves. Yes, we have. Poor Flora. I she awfully ill to leave so suddenly? No. She just had to go into town. This house didn't quite agree with her anymore. What? Flora left loved house. She was happy here. As happy as I am. Are you so very happy? Why did you want to be alone with me? I think you know quite well, Miles. Why, last night, when you were supposed to be in bed were you in the garden? I told you. The real reason, Miles! Don't shout, Miss. It makes you look ugly. And cruel. Miles, listen to me. I was brought up to love people and help them. Help them even if they refused my help. Even if sometimes it should hurt them. That's the only reason I am here. To help you! Whatever you have done I am not against you. I do not think it' s your fault. But I haven't done anything! Then why were you sent away from school? Because I'm different. No, you're not. You're like every other boy. Ah, now who's not telling the truth? No, miss. You don't think I'm like any other boy. That's why you're afraid. Did you take things, Miles? Is that what you did at school? No, I'm not a thief! Then what did you do? Don't make me say it. Shall I tell you who taught you? The things you have said. The things you have done. Shall I tell you his name? You don't fool me! I know why you keep on and on. Miles! It's because you're afraid. You're afraid you might be crazy! So you keep on and on trying to make me admit something that isn't true. Trying to frighten me the why you frightened Flora! But I'm not Flora. I'm no baby. You think you can run to my Uncle was a lot of lies. But he won't believe you. Not when I tell him what you are. A man woman! You never fooled us. We always knew! Admit it, Miles. Say his name and it will be over. The man who taught you. The man you've been meeting. The man you've never stopped meeting! You're wrong. You're crazy! Shall I tell you his name? He's dead! Look, Miles! He's there! In this room for the last time! You must say the name, Miles. Say his name! Say his name. I can't! Say his name! Quint. Peter Quint! Go! You can't have him! It's morning. Miles... They've gone. You're safe now. You're free! Miles...? Miles? Oh, dear God, no! Somebody? Please! Help us! Richard? Richard! Where are you? He's not breathing! Somebody? Anybody? Oh God, please! That was outstanding! You didn't miss a line and your use of the stage and improvisation... It just got better and better! How are you feeling? Okay... I really got into it. It all felt so real. That certainly came across! If you can repeat that performance tomorrow night we've got a winner! Anyway, I'm sure you want to properly meet the other actors. Here's Liz. It's so lovely to meet you! I'm Elizabeth. You were amazing! It's as if you'd been rehearsing for weeks. Thank you! She were such a great guide on stage. I must get this wig off! I'll see you tomorrow. Good night. Good night. Oh, my God! Sorry, I should have taken that off. Nice to meet you properly. You were wonderful. Thank you. You really scared me! Fantastic work! Oh, I I didn't realize you were the same... Yes, I play the Uncle as well. Not a bad makeup job. It's fairly standard for the Uncle and Quint to be played by the same actor. Otherwise they'd both have a lot of downtime off stage. And you get to save paying another actor as well! How were you guys disappearing on stage? I really couldn't figure it out. It's a trick of the lights. We know just where to stand when the lights go off and come back on. Well, you definitely fooled me! Anyway, it's very late folks and we need to clear the building. And you need to get a good night's rest for the big day tomorrow. We'll get changed. Great work again. Can't wait for tomorrow. I'll drop you off at your hotel. You must be exhausted. I am way way past exhausted! But I'd love to say good night to the- I just want to say again your improvisation was phenomenal! I really believed you were interacting with the children. You really believed...? Well, of course we couldn't have them rehearsing this late at night. But you'll get the chance to meet them tomorrow before we perform. I'll just go and get my things backstage and then we'll drop you off. You just wait here. I'll be back in a moment.
