Your dad said he'll be home in an hour. All right. [loud knock on door] All right, so you got the boy all situated? Yeah, we do. I got an extra room upstairs, so... -All right, well... -Yeah. And you're working where? I'm doing a landscaping company. -I kind of work for myself. -Okay. You know, I make my own hours. I got a few clients. What about school for him? There's one, you know, 20 minutes away. It's a little bit of a drive, but he's gonna be-- -How does he get there? -I'll drive him. -Okay. All right. -Yeah. -Yeah. -All right, good. Yeah, it's nice up there. It's secluded, you know? -Mm, elbow room. -Yeah. Well, we got kind of a long drive ahead of us. Yeah. Sure. Get going, thank you. I appreciate you getting in touch with me instead of Child Protective Services. Oh, you seem to have your head screwed on right. Mm-hmm. Well, all right, good luck to you both. You ready? God, that guy loves to fucking talk. You wanna eat before or after we get your stuff? -Doesn't matter. -All right. Let's get that out of the way. [exhales] You're getting big, dude. What grade you in now? Seventh. What the fuck? [sighs] You sleep all right? Yeah. If I make some breakfast, will you eat? -Yeah. -You like omelettes? Yeah. All right, I'll leave my ball cheese off your omelettes. What is there to do up here? I got a tree house. [man] I don't know, it needs a little work, but it's kind of cool. Got a tire swing, too. What the fuck? We're out of gas. Yeah, that's the game. Run it back. -Where you going? -Fuck that. -Run it back. -I'm done. Really? [telephone rings] Hey, can you bring that to me? [boy] Where is it? You might have to look a little. -Hello? -[operator's voice mumbling] Here, it's for you. -[man] Mason? -Yeah? Oh, good, I was hoping they'd let you go with Cameron. Where's he at? -I think he went outside. -Really? How's it going? Good, I guess. Yeah. Listen, looks like I'm gonna be gone for a while. I know. I want you to be good now. -I will. -You can't fuck things up because then you got no place else to go. -This is it. -All right. -What's that? -I said okay. Just because I fucked things up doesn't mean you have to. I know. You gotta always ask yourself this question, "Am I doing right, or am I doing wrong?" And if you're gonna do wrong, make sure you do it right. I know. -Go get Cameron for me. -He just walked in. Well, put him on. -He said to put you on. -I don't wanna talk to him right now. He can't talk right now. Put him on the fucking phone. He said to put you on. -Here, take it. -I don't wanna talk to him right now. He wants to fucking-- I don't wanna fucking talk to him right now. Look, when I say I don't want to talk to somebody on the phone, I mean it. I know you didn't ask for all this. Neither did I. I know you probably don't wanna be here. And that's okay, too. But we're gonna have to figure out a way to make it work, all right? All right. We'll dial in your room when we get a chance. Open up your books to chapter eight. For those of you who are a little slow, that is page 243. Mason, where's your book? I forgot to bring it. You forgot to bring it. Sorry, I didn't realize I had this class today. Well, I guess you better wait out here then and try to memorize which classes you have on which days. Don't forget to bring your books, faggot. Nice backpack, queer. I'm sorry, I lost track of time. How'd it go? Fine. -You make any friends? -No. Well, it takes time. What about your teachers? You like them? I don't know, one of them is kind of a bitch. Why? I don't know why, she just is. Well, what a fucking cunt. See, that's exactly why I quit school. You dropped out? Fuck, yeah, when I was like 16. What's up? Nothing. What's that? This is pH down. What's it do? It... helps the plants absorb all the nutrients that are in the reservoir. What strain is it? This is sour diesel. -Is it a kush? -What do you know about kush? -I know it's the best. -Oh, yeah? 'Cause you heard that in some rap songs? No. Why don't you grow kush? 'Cause the East Coast wants sour diesel. It's like kush's cousin. -Do you smoke weed? -Uh-uh. Not anymore. Do you? No. Then how do you know if it's any good? You just look at it, smell it. I don't know. Hey, what's this? That is an air conditioner. What about that? That is a CO2 burner. And this? That's ventilation for the lights. You hook this all up yourself? Yep, after my partner left. Where's he at? Oh, he's in prison. Why? 'Cause he got caught. How often do you have to water? A few times a week. How long till it's done? Mm, couple months. Then what? Then I chop it down, hang it up, dry it, trim it, and sell it. -To who? -Whoever wants to buy it. Do you sell it to the clubs? Sometimes. I try not to, though. Why? 'Cause they're fucking greedy. How did your partner get caught? He got pulled over with 100 pounds in Texas. How'd he get pulled over? Well, he had California license plates, for one. Was it your guys' weed? Yeah. How much money is that? A lot. Are you scared of getting caught? I try not to think about it. "Welcome. Please have a seat. Thank you for taking the time to attend. We only have a short time to complete this conference, so if you have any questions, please make them brief or wait until the question portion at the end. The purpose of this conference is to share my evaluation of progress this semester. I'll be discussing my classes, my behavior, and my study skills. I'll also be asking you to help me accomplish some goals that I've set for myself. My weaknesses in organization are not writing things down and not having pencils. I will improve by writing things down and having pencils. My weaknesses in homework are not doing it and not asking for help doing it. I will improve by doing my homework and asking for help doing it." Will you really? Yeah. Who would you ask for help? Probably my brother. Probably? I'm gonna hold you to that. If he asks you for help, are you gonna make the time to help him? Of course. So, for my self-reflection marks, I gave myself a check for sit up, a check for lean forward, a minus for ask questions, a minus for side conversations, and a check for track your teacher. Here's my grades right now. Social Studies, "F," Science, "D," Language Arts, "F," Math, "D," Spanish, "F," and P.E., "B." Good job. Excuse me? On the "B" in P.E. Good job. We both know he could be doing better. Well, not in kickball class. These grades are a cry for help. Well, that's one perspective. You know, I don't know the details of your guys' home life, I am guessing here that you've known your fair share of hardship, but it would help him if you took this seriously. You need to get these grades up, and you need to turn in your homework and you need to do what you're told and follow the rules, okay? 'Cause if you don't, then you're not gonna amount to anything, and you're just never gonna be able get a job, and you're just gonna be a stupid loser your whole life, dude. Mason, would you wait outside? Sure. You graduated high school, right? No. Hmm. What do you do? I'm in sales. What do you sell? What do you need? I sell medical supplies. I work from home. It's very fortunate considering your lack of education. Yeah, it is, I guess. I think it's highly irresponsible of you to have such a nonchalant attitude about his education. You know, if you read between the lines, you would see that it's the opposite. I actually care about him so much that I wouldn't dare, like, scold him or make him feel worse than he probably already does for something as irrelevant as a social studies grade. That is hardly irrelevant. Really? Do you even know who, like, designs the curriculum that you're teaching? It's the same group of people that own all the banks. They own all the media, all the politicians. They own all the corporations. They own the federal reserve, too. So, they can just print up as much money as they want, right? And then take half of your paycheck to pay back interest on that loan for the money that they just printed out of nowhere. And then they cut your pay and they blame you because he's got an "F" in Social Studies. It's ridiculous. The game's rigged. And like the fact that he's not, like, sitting up and leaning forward to listen to the disinformation you're teaching is fucking hopeful, and I'm proud of him for that. [man] Tell me a little bit about your anxiety. [Cameron] I'm sick when I get around, like, large crowds of people or new places. I get, like, sweaty palms, shortness of breath. And your insomnia? Tell me about that. I don't know, I just have trouble sleeping. Okay, so, it says you have a little bit of depression? -Is that recent? -It might be seasonal. Okay, so let me see. It says you prefer edibles. Which kind do you mainly use? I mean, I actually prefer to juice it, but you didn't have that option on there, so, I mean, yeah, I'll do edibles, too. I try to refrain from smoking it. Okay, great, and, um... is there anything else? Um... I was actually hoping that you could get me an exemption. I can write you up for 99 plants and 12 pounds. Okay? Just go ahead and write this out here for you. And... and you're good to go. And this is our new business license.

You're gonna complain about fucking paintball? -Yeah. -Oh, my God, dude. We used to play with fucking pellet guns and never complained about it. No. Oh, my fucking God, dude. Fucking stupid. You're being such a fucking weenie. Come on, man. Dude! I'll give you-- I'll give you five free shots, come on, man. -Seriously? -Yeah, man. -Fuck! Ow. -Hurts, huh? [music playing] I can help you if you want. You wanna help me trim? -I've done it before. -For who? Dad. Really? Trimming sucks. I actually like it. I mean... all right. Whatever you wanna do. How old were you when you started smoking weed? Um, I was like ten. I used to fucking steal it from Dad. He finally caught me, though. -What did he do? -He beat the fuck out of me. It didn't stop me, though. Do you plan on doing this for the rest of your life? Do what, grow weed? Yeah. Yeah, maybe, I mean, it's pretty much all I know how to do. What about when it becomes legal? That won't happen. You don't think so? Not a chance. Why not? You got all these corporations with monetary incentives to keep it illegal, and they're willing to spend the money to lobby the politicians in DC to make sure of it. If everybody that was making money off weed put it all together to lobby to those same politicians, it might have a chance, but that'll never happen because then those same people wouldn't be making money anymore. So, you don't want it to be legal? Fuck, no, then what? Go back to school? Get a job? Pay taxes? It's a fucking joke. So, that's why you grow weed? To not pay taxes? That's partly why I grow weed. I mean, it really is medicine. Just 'cause some people abuse it doesn't take away the fact. Also it's like one of the few ways that working-class peasants like us can fucking bump up to the middle class. What do you mean? I'm fucking 25, and I made it. Do you own this house? No, I pay rent. How much? Like $5,000 a month. So, you haven't really made it then. Sounds like your landlord has, though. [trimmers buzzing] Dude, come on. What, are you gonna stare, dude? Fucking knock. -Sorry. -Don't be sorry. -Just fucking knock first. -Gotta take a shit. Well, wait till I'm done. Come on, just let me go to the fucking toilet. Wait till I'm done. What are you even doing in there? What does it look like I'm doing? I don't know. I'm getting ready. I have a friend coming over. I can't hold it. Go upstairs in your own bathroom. I like to take a shower after I shit. Oh, my God, quit being so fucking weird and just go in your own bathroom. You're the one who's fucking weird. [car approaches] -Hi. -Hi, there. You must be Mason. -Yeah. -I'm Veronica, -and your brother has told me -Nice to meet you. a lot about you. [chuckles] Come inside. So, is he in the shower? -He's trimming his pubes. -How do you know that? I kind of walked in on him. Wow, he must have been pretty pissed off. -Yeah. -Yeah, sometimes people need a little bit of privacy. So, are girls into that stuff? -You mean guys who shave? -Yeah. -Depends on the girl. -What about you? I'm open. So, what has my brother told you about me? He said that you were way too smart for your own good, very funny, and you actually remind him of himself when he was your age. -Really? -Yeah. You sound like my kind of guy. -Mm. -[laughs] So, you got a little sister or what? I do, actually. [chuckles] You behave. Hey, handsome. You're early. I missed you. Your brother told me what you were up to in here. What? He's such a little snitch. He's a cutie. Do you love me? Mm-hmm. Let me hear you say it. I love you. Say it again. I love you. I love you. [Cameron] Waiting on you. Make sure it's a good one. Stop. Are you sure? Think about it really hard. -How about-- -Okay. Okay, see, you don't want me to know which one's yours, 'cause you automatically lose if I don't draw-- I know which one's yours. -Which one? -It's in my right hand, now it's in my left. Right, left. See it? -Yep, skeletons in the closet. -Oh, actually. Or plumber's crack. I'm going with plumber's crack. That one was actually-- Yeah. It's that one. Super uncomfortable. Where you at? [Mason] Up here. Get down here now. -Yeah? -[mocking] Yeah? -What? -You killed all our fucking plants. What do you mean "What"? I did? How? I don't know. You tell me. I don't know, I did exactly what you told me to do. Oh, really? I told you to kill the plants? -'Cause you did. -No. You killed the plants. I know I didn't. Do you know how? Do you know how you killed the plants? No. 'Cause I do. It looks like they got burnt. Did you use a pH meter? No, 'cause it was was dead, and I-- So, I just-- -[groans] -So, you just what? You just killed the fucking plants 'cause the pH meter was dead? -So what? -No, I measured fucking 55ml, -so it should've been fine. -Oh. Really? Are you sure it wasn't teaspoons? 'Cause the fucking markings are right next to each other. My bad. [mocking] My bad. My bad. I just cost us $20,000. My fucking bad. I'm sorry. It was an accident. Oh, I'm sorry. Fucking... Are you fucking high right now? Why do you smell like weed? You fucking smoking weed? Come here. Come here. Fucking back away from me. Are you high right now? -No. -No? Yeah, you are. You're such a fucking liar, dude. -No, I'm not. -Yeah, you are. Don't fucking lie to me. -I'm not lying to you. -Oh, really? I'm gonna give you one more fucking chance to tell the truth. Are you high right now? -No, I'm not. -Yeah. No, you're not high right now? Yeah, you are fucking high right now, you liar. You think I'm fucking stupid? No. 'Cause I'm not fucking stupid. -Okay, I was. -Oh, you were? Hmm. So, now I can't trust you 'cause you fucking lie to me. How am I supposed to trust you? I don't know. It's why you don't lie to people, dude. Then don't trust me, dude. I don't care. That's not gonna work out well for you. Where do you think you're gonna go? Where you gonna go? This is it. Lie to me again, motherfucker. See what happens. I won't. I can't believe you're fucking smoking weed, dude. This whole time? What? Why are you just standing there? Say something. Say something, stupid. Say something! What? Is there a problem with it? Obviously, there's a problem with you lying to me about it. I don't know why I lied. I just did. Oh, really? [mumbles] Fucking-- Fucking make me sick, dude. Get the fuck out of my face. -Hey, hey. Get back here! -No. No! Get fucking back here! Get fucking-- I'm not fucking around with you, dude. How long have you been smoking weed? -How long you-- -As long as -I've been with you. -Oh, really? Why? 'Cause it makes me feel good. Okay. Fine, then. Don't fucking lie to me ever again. I don't give a fuck if you smoke weed. Don't lie to me, dude. I let you into my fucking world. You're the one teaching me how to grow weed. -Oh, really-- -Fucking hypocrite, dude. I'm not mad at you for fucking smoking it. I'm mad at you for lying about it. You're the one who's a drug dealer. I'm not a fucking d-- I've never sold a drug in my life. Keep telling yourself that, fool. You're a fool. So, what's the deal? Well, Mason thought it would be a good idea to hit this boy in the head. -Why? -'Cause he pantsed me. Regardless, Mason needs to apologize. The other boy's already taken responsibility for his actions. -Screw that. -Just say you're sorry. I'm not sorry. [woman] Mason, this is serious. You are not going to be able to walk with the rest of your class in graduation -as a result of this. -I don't care. Hey, stop it, and just say you're sorry. I'm sorry for pantsing you. I was just playing around. Okay, now it's your turn. I'm sorry you pantsed me, too. -Seriously? -What? If this happens next year when you're in high school, the authorities would be involved. Guess what? I'm not sorry. I'd do it again next year. You know what? Grab your stuff. All right, now if you're gonna hit somebody, make it count. Try again. -Make it fucking count! -I am. Well, get your hips into it and level the motherfucker then, all right? Like that? Yeah. Sure. If you wanna get laughed at and then beat the fuck up. No, that wouldn't happen. Like that? Ha, like, yeah, sure, if you wanna fucking fight a fairy and win. Why am I even fighting this guy? Because he's threatening to fucking steal your lunch money. I eat school lunch. All right, he's threatening to steal your wallet. -I don't have a wallet. -Okay, he's threatening -to rape your girlfriend. -What girlfriend? He's threatening to rape you. How? In the fucking butt, -that's how. -Why? Because he's a fucking pervert. Are you serious? Pretend. Pretend. Pretend a guy wants to rape me? Oh, my-- You know. -[groans] -Okay. You fucking-- You think that fucking guy is gonna be raping anybody? -No. -Exactly. That's why you gotta fucking dig deep. You gotta let that anger out. You can't fucking bottle it up, man. That's how people get cancer. Come on, man. Let's go. It's rape time. -Come on, man. -What the fuck? Oh-- I'm sorry. No, that's good, dude! It's rape time, come on, man, let's go. Hit me in the fucking face. -Let's go. -Fuck you, dude! What the-- Let's go. -In the eye, bitch. -Stop fucking around. [whirring] What would you have done with all your money if your partner didn't get arrested? I was gonna start this fertilizer company and soil company. -Really? -Yeah. -For what? -To fucking make money. During the fucking gold rush, all the gold miners went broke. -You know who got rich? -Who? The motherfuckers selling gold mining equipment. So, that's what I was trying to do. Plus I had the fucking best slogan ever. What was your slogan? We're number one in number two. It's pretty good. Have you ever been in a fight? Yeah, I've been in hella fights. I used to get in 'em all the time. I used to have to go to fucking counseling and shit when I was a kid. That's good. Who won? -Who won what? -The fight. The last fight that you were in. Fuck, who you think won? Not you. Shit, son, I always been a winner. Smells bad. Don't breathe it in, actually. Put your shirt over your face. -I can't. I'm holding this. -There you go. Wait, wait, no, two hands. There it is. [singsong] Sketchy. -You all right? -Yeah. You sure? [door unlocks] -Hey. -What? I'm fine. Motherfuckers got us on lockdown 23 hours a day just 'cause some fucking nigger stabbed an-- Hey, we don't wanna hear that shit. Oh, I forgot, you can't say nigger, right? Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute. Come on back, come on. Have a seat, have a seat. That's good. Now, that's better. Sorry. That's better. So, how's it going? You playing any sports? -No, I'm not. -No? Why don't you take your fucking brother to a baseball game, Cameron? You're looking healthy. Yeah, I've been working out in my cell. Push-ups, sit-ups, burpees, and whatnot. Rather be outside, of course. Yeah, my cellie and me got a new routine marked out. -It's killing my back, though. -Same guy? Nah, it's new one. I mean, he's all right. He stabbed his old lady a couple of times when he caught her cheating on him, but other than that, he's a good guy. -Yeah. -Jesus. -Yeah, he don't play around. -Guess not. What are you gonna do? Listen, my back and my feet have been killing me. I thought maybe I had that peripheral, you know, that nerve thing, but I had it checked it out, and they said I'm in the clear, so who the fuck knows? Well, it's good you're in the clear. No, it's not. Now, I think it could be my shoes. There's a guy in here who's got the hook up for shoes -with cushioned insoles. -Uh-huh. And he's a hungry fucker, so I'm working him for a trade. You're gonna trade your food for shoes? Fuck yeah, the big boy loves to eat, the fat motherfucker. And I got a six-month stash of soups. You see, I've been doing these sports pools. We bet on everything, basketball, football, NASCAR, tennis, you name it. And you know me, I've always been a winner, right? Right. Yeah, so that's how I got the soups and whatnot. And what else? Oh, yeah, were you able to put any money on my books, 'cause I got commissary coming up. I was gonna put some on on the way out. Mm. Well, I hate to ask you this. Do you think you could throw a little more on there? -For what? -"For what?" For me, for fuck's sake. That's-- For what? You don't gotta get all loud. What's the money for? Oh, sorry, my back. I can't sleep. I got this new cunt doctor that axed my meds. She said I didn't need 'em, but there's this Mexican dude in here I can get 'em from. How much do you need? Couple hundred just till I can get 'em prescribed again. All right, yeah, I'll throw a couple hundred on there for you. Thanks. So, how's everything else? You got a girl? -Nah. -No? Now, that's smart. Really, you know, better off without them. Hookers are cheaper in the long run anyway. Yeah, I just don't get out much, you know? You'll never lose out on pussy when you're chasing money, but you always lose money when you're chasing pussy. Make a note of that, Mason. Words of wisdom. I don't think he's there yet. Well, he will be soon enough if he's anything like his old man. Yeah, maybe. Listen, this isn't easy for me to say, but I wanted to tell you that I-- Well, I feel bad about not talking to you for so many years. I guess it was a pride thing. You know, what's done is done, and when you get out, maybe you'd-- That won't be for a long time. Why? You got a sentence? -Yeah. -And? Three. -What about half time? -That is half. You got six fucking years? Uh-huh. No luck with the public pretender. Yeah, that's why you've always gotta ask yourself this question, "Am I doing wrong or am I doing right?" And if you're gonna do wrong, make sure you do it right. You got that, Mason? Yeah. So, you like where you're living? -Yeah. -Still way out there -in the cut? -Yeah. What the fuck do you do out there? Just play games and stuff. You playing any sports in school? I don't play any sports, remember? I forgot. I just told you that. He's got a little mouth on him, huh? No. Listen to him. You know, you're lucky I'm locked up in here. Otherwise things might be a little different. Hey, give me a minute with my boy, will you? Yeah. You being good to your brother? Yeah. Can't fuck up 'cause you got no place else to go, this is it. I just want you to do good. I know. Well, your brother turned out all right, so maybe you will, too. I guess I'm batting .500 so far, knock on wood. See you, Dad. [cell phone vibrating] -Yo. -[man] Yo. -What up? -So... What's a silly little homo and rhymes with my nuts? -Cameron! -That doesn't rhyme at all. What's up, you fucking dork? What's up? These guys are the fucking worst, like, literally trying to ruin my life. But put a little box in your little fucking box car and come over to my house. Okay, I'll be there tomorrow. [sighs] Dude, I've been doing this all fucking day. Come over. They're ready to rock and roll or they're gonna dip. I'm not driving at night, dude. Okay, well, maybe you should fucking grow a pair and learn that this green is gold and they're ready to fucking party now. All right, well, tell them if they're ready to party, they can fucking hold off till tomorrow. Yeah, their fucking flight leaves, dude. It's, like, tonight or nothing. Tell them to fucking rearrange it. They're not trying do that. They're going to try and fucking party with hoes in fucking Vegas or some shit. They-- I don't give a fuck, like-- They don't give a fuck. I don't give a fuck. It's either now or nothing, dude, and I've wasted an entire day trying to push your fucking weed. Yeah, well, if they want it, dude, they can wait till the morning. Fucking-- Just have them change -their fucking flight-- -Dude, Cameron, you're a fucking bitch, dude. I don't know why the fuck, like, I even fuck with this, dude. It's a waste of fucking time if you're not gonna fucking work, dude. It's-- I'm not driving at night, bro. What the fuck? I don't know what the fuck you're laughing at, dude. I'm fucking serious, bro. Okay. So, then move someone else's. -I don't give a fuck. -And you're a fucking punk, dude, I swear to God, dude. It's like-- Like, go fuck yourself, Cameron. Okay, call me back with an update. [cell phone vibrates] Hello? [man] Yo, what up, fat ass? What up? What are you doing? -I'm actually eating. -Go figure. Well, hopefully we're even fucking better than you are today because looks like this will work. I got them to push till 2:00 p.m. mañana. So, don't fuck up. Load up that herb now. Fucking get some sleep. Be ready to rock and roll because these guys are trying to get on a plane, and I'm trying to take their money. Awesome, man, thank you so much. -Appreciate it. -Yup. -Tell him thank you. -All right. -Yo, what's up? -Well, fucking-- Hey, Mason wanted to say thank you. You're paying for his college.
