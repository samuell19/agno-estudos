In the martial arts world, this is the legendary Xingyun Manor, home to Li Xunhuan. This residence is well-known not because it has housed ten great scholars, three were ranked No. 3 in the Imperial Exams; but because the legendary Li Xunhuan once lived here. Three years ago, a shocking event took place here. Li Xunhuan killed the Plum Blossom Bandit here at Cold Fragrance Chamber of Xingyun Manor. The great residence has since been quiet after the incident. There hasn't been any sighting of swordsmen Li Xunhuan, and Master Afei since then. The lady of the house, Lin Shiyin, is the only one left in the manor. She quietly weeps during night time and hardly sleeps. At the same time, there's a man in a wine house not far from Xingyun Manor. Using a dagger, he's carving a piece of wood. He is a regular at this wine house for almost six months. Welcome... Waiter... Grand dad, there's a table. Alright. Here, please sit down. Waiter. Yes. Waiter, here. Coming. Grand dad, you promised me please tell me stories when we're drinking. Stories aren't that interesting, I'd rather tell you about the recent martial world happenings. Please do. I heard that tomorrow night, the 15th of November, treasures will appear in Xingyun Manor. That's why during these few days, a lot of martial arts experts head to Xingyun Manor. Xingyun Manor? Isn't that the home to the famous Li Xunhuan? Not any more. Why not? I don't know the details. Right, other than Li Xunhuan, Master Afei is also very well-known too. Unfortunately, he has vanished just like Li Xunhuan. I heard he disappeared off with Lin Xianer. Old man, don't you have anything else to say other than Li Xunhuan and Afei? There're lots of martial arts experts. I know that, but no one will listen now. People are leaving. Who's left? There's an old man, a loner in a blue cape drinking. A green-faced person, all dressed in green, with a spear. It's a strange world. One-leg Iron Stick, ranked 9th, would've run into Green-faced Spear, who's ranked 8th. Everyone knows that No. 8 will always be better than No. 9. Stop it. Zhuge Iron Stick, we have to go now. Ximen Rou, don't be so happy just yet. I believe that we shall see each other again very soon. No wonder the green-faced man is ranked 8th, he's quite skilled. Who's the young man in yellow? Have you heard of the Money Clan? Yes. It's a very strong clan in recent years, they've won many battles. He's the young chief Shangguan Fei. What are they doing here? My guess is, they are heading to Xingyun Manor. The wine is quite good here, but a person can't drink all day, and waste his life away. One should leave when it's time. I'm off now, should I pay for your bill? No, thank you. One must pay for his own debts. Cannot hide, cannot run. Great, he is finally awake, and we can go now. Tomorrow night at eleven, Xingyun Manor. Cousin Xunhuan. Cousin Shiyin. How are you? I'm fine. Not bad. You've left for 3 years, the garden remains the same. The days went by, and you? I've always dreamt of coming home soon, I was wandering for three years. I'm depressed after I'm awake from my drunkenness. Heartbroken either drunk or not. It's got nothing to do with the wind and the moon. A song of farewell and tears. I'm used to the lonesome here, why are you returning? It'd only make the winter plum blossoms melancholy. I just wish to look at the plum blossoms in winter. Tonight at eleven, something will happen here. What is it? You'll know then. Close the door, blow out the candle. Don't come outside no matter what. Who are you? Mind your own business. I'm not here to fight like you do, I'm here to wait for someone. And the person who wants to kill you is behind you. Do you think you're good enough to be here? Go! Young Chief. We've killed everyone. Says who? There's one person inside. Go! Not one, but two. Ximen Rou, I spared your life in the day time, but you're destined to die anyhow. Go! No wonder the green-faced man is ranked 8th. Looks like I'll need to take care of you. While they are fighting, go search around upstairs. Yes. Li Xunhuan is finally here. There's no treasure here, please head back, the snow's about to stop. Who would trust you? Li Xunhuan, I've always wanted to fight you. Others might be scared, but I'm the one-leg Iron Stick. Go. You are... Guo Songyang, I have no gift with me, take this as my gift. Songyang Sword, Ranked fourth. If I'm right, you must be the young chief of the Money Clan, son of Shangguan Jinhong, who's ranked second. What if I am? Please bring a message to your father, tell him that I'll pay him a visit soon. Even you don't kill me today, but listen well. I'll definitely kill you next time we meet. You live up to your father's reputation, vicious, aggressive. Go. You are... Green-faced Spear, Ximen Rou. Ranked 8th, Green-faced Spear, I didn't expect you'd fall for a trap like the others. Shut up. Brother Ximen. Brother Ximen, I'm telling the truth. Why won't you believe me? There's no truth in the martial arts world. There're only dead people, gold and fame. Ximen Rou. If I can snatch your weapon within 10 strokes, could you do me a favor? What's that? Leave the martial arts world, and stop bothering us. You're very arrogant indeed. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Please. Who would have thought? There's no place for me in the big martial arts world. Brother Guo, thank you for everything. Don't thank me, you should ask me why I'm here first. Have I offended you, Brother Guo? Never. I've been looking for you for the last three years. I want to find out whether my Songyang Sword can out rank your Legendary Flying Daggers. Because you're ranked third, and I'm fourth... The plum blossoms here are too pretty, I don't want to ruin them. I'll be waiting for you outside. Go ahead. A reunion is the beginning of another separation. Drinking won't do you any good, you should drink less from now on. Take care of yourself. This is the river side, and it's the end of the road. Brother Guo, I've left the martial art world, what's the point in fighting someone like me? Brother Li, you might have left the martial arts world, but your name still thrives. I'm here because of your reputation. Friends are easy to make, but to find an opponent like you is really hard. I've dedicated my life to martial arts, and I am not scared of death. Tonight's duel is the greatest pleasure in my life. Please. I wish I wasn't me tonight, please. Why don't you kill me? We've never said anything about killing from the beginning. Rumors are right; not only you're a better swordsman, you're a better person. Impressive... that was very exciting. Lady, what are you doing here? Who're you talking to? My name is not Lady. And may I ask your name, miss? Sun Xiaohong. Right, you were with your grandfather? That's right, he sent me here to fetch you. Those two sitting opposite my grand father are the Chief and Vice Chief of the Money Clan. Shangguan Jinhong and Jing Wuming. Shangguan Jinhong is the one in the yellow overcoat. His "Dragon Phoenix Golden Rings" ranked second. That's Jing Wuming, Left-handed Sacred Knife. What are they doing here? Come. You asked me what they're doing here, you can ask my grand father directly. Old master. It's the latest conspiracy in the martial arts world. After you've left, and Master Afei has vanished, The Money Clan has solicited seventeen heroes of the top list, they want to rule the world. Master Li, the fate of the martial arts world lies in yours and Master Afei's hands. How? Because Shangguan Jinhong is now ranked second, with the help of Jing Wuming, the Left-handed Sacred Knife, his skills are unmatched. A total of 380 experts died under his knife. The only way is to find Master Afei, if you two join force, there might be a chance. But I haven't heard from Afei in the last five years. With Lin Xianer he's hid in the Plum Blossoms Forest. Old Master Sun, who are you really? You know so much about the martial arts world, and you're equal to Shangguan Jinhong, could you be... Master Li, you're very smart indeed. You will find out my identity later. Your mission now is to find Master Afei. Xiaoli. Master Li's here. When did you arrive? Miss Lin. Xianer, let me help you. I'm fine, cleaning is a woman's work. Let me do it. Let me help you, Xianer. No, you should keep Master Li's company. Right, Xiaoli, come in. I'll get the tea. It's alright, I'll do it. Please sit inside, Master Li. Please. How did you find out I live here? Someone told me that you've been living here since you left Xingyun Manor. Yes, I've been painting, and planting plum blossoms. You've always loved plum blossoms, right? Come here. There were 2076 blooms yesterday, eight dropped today, twenty four more bloomed. There's a total of 2092. You count the blooms everyday? It's been quiet, I have nothing to do. The flowers bloom too soon this year. Those who bloom too soon will die sooner. Your sword? I haven't used it for a long time. Why not? Because Xianer said the sword will make me think about the martial arts world. The tea. This is a humble place, we don't have wine fit for you, please take the tea instead. I've quit drinking. That's good. If you drink too much, you'll end up like me. I told him to quit. He gets up early and goes to sleep after dinner. Where's Lin Xianer? Lin Xianer, leave me alone, I'm off. No, not yet, I want more. I'm not in mood. Guo Songyang. Songyang, when will I see you again? I'll return when I feel like it. You? Yes, it's me. Why were you spying on my secrets? I had no intention to. I followed Lin Xianer from Afei's home, and ended up here. What? Lin Xianer is still with Afei? In that case, Afei has no idea about what she's been doing? I guess not. Because Afei sleeps very early these years. I think she sneaks out every night... after Afei's asleep. Do you see her often? You love her? Not at all. A woman like her treats all men the same. I only look for her when I'm at my worst. Could you do me a favor? Look for Afei and tell him to truth? Afei. Afei. Look. Master Li. There's a secret passage way here, no wonder Lin Xianer was disappeared the other day. You're really here. Lin Xianer and Afei, where are they? Gone. Where? I'm only a maid, I wouldn't know. But before Miss Lin's gone, she left a letter for you. Master Li, if you want to see us, wait for us at the Plum Blossoms Forest Chamber. I know you are good friends with Xiaoli, but... since we've decided to leave the martial arts world, won't you agree that we should stay away from him? Have you finished eating? Yes. I'll pour you some tea. Have some tea. Thank you. It's windy. Are you alright? I guess my life has been too comfortable, I want to sleep as soon as I've finished eating. Go on then. Are you Master Jing? I've heard all about you. Don't come near. If you want to talk to me, you must know the rules. I ask you the questions, I won't answer. Yes. You are Lin Xianer? You wrote and asked me to come here? That's right. You mentioned about arranging to meet with Li Xunhuan, and you told me to kill him? Correct. Why would you want to do that? Because I know Money Clan wants to rule the world, you've always wanted to get rid of Li Xunhuan. And how do you know that I'll kill him for you? Turn around and you will find out. You live up to your reputation, Lin Xianer likes to seduce men. You... And she always succeeds. I see, big hero. I thought you didn't like women at first. "Plum Blossoms Forest Chamber" Who are you looking for? Is Li Xunhuan here? He's not, what is it? Vice Chief Jing would like to see him in the Pavilion. Pavilion by the waterfalls, Jing Wuming. I'm leaving, Guo Songyang. What are you doing here? I invited Xiaoli. Xiaoli ranked third, and I'm ranked fourth. And you're not even on Bai Xiaosheng's list, you're not qualified to challenge Xiaoli. You're trying to get yourself killed. Brother Guo... Brother Guo Brother Guo I heard that you killed for a woman. Yes. So how skilled was Guo Songyang, who's ranked fourth? Great. He outranks the chiefs of the seven sword clans. Too bad that he made three big mistakes in a row after he was wounded. Do you have any idea that he did that on purpose? Why? He knew that he's no match for you, that's why he did it on purpose. So that Li Xunhuan will know your lethal attacks after he's seen the wounds. Where are you going? I still have time to kill Li Xunhuan now. I know. I knew that you've always wanted a duel with Xiaoli. But you can't go now. Why not? You'll lose definitely. Says who? Me. After killing Guo Songyang you aren't as bellicose. Meanwhile Li Xunhuan is furious and is grievous. He's already won in morale. And today's you are not yesterday's you. I'm still myself. You could win yesterday because you were heartless. But now, you went to do something for a woman, it means you're not heartless. So you couldn't do what you did yesterday. Jing Wuming, if you must kill, go and kill that woman who's touched your heart. Are you all here? Yes. The money from selling Miss Lin's property and business including brothels & opium; it's here, 10,000,000 taels All here. Right, Miss Lin. What can we do for you this time? Xiaoli came here to look for Afei. I've told Jing Wuming to kill Xiaoli, but he's killed the wrong person, that's why I want you to kill Xiaoli. There's no need to. Because dead people can't kill. What are you doing here, Jing Wuming? I'm here to kill. Who sent you to kill me? I did. Why? Because no one of our Money Clan can love. You must be Chief Shangguan of the Money Clan. Do you need others to kill for you? Do you know that I can kill way better than Jing Wuming? How? Because he needs his knife, but I need no weapon. Plus, I have other things Jing Wuming doesn't have. Come on. This way please. What would you like to drink? Anything. Have you seen a woman in green and a man in blue pass by lately? I haven't paid much attention. Thank you. You're welcome. Waiter. Waiter. Coming... Sir. He stinks. What would you like? Beef and wine. The bill, let's go. Waiter, the bill. Good wine, come... Fruits in sugar icing. Palm reading... Stand up. Are you talking to me? Who's calling you? Man in blue. I know you'll sell your life with money. How did you know? Afei. Money. My money. You. Are you trying to steal my money? No, my friend. I just want to ask you something, if you answer me one question, I'll return this to you. One question? Go on then. Your friend in blue clothes, where is he now? Friend? He's not my friend. Us beggars don't have any friends. Why did you save him earlier? I thought you said one question. I've answered, now return the money. I knew that you're no ordinary beggar. If you were, why couldn't I keep up with you? So these are your friends. That's right, someone paid us to catch you. We know that you've been looking for Afei every where. That's why... Very well staged. If not, you won't fall for it. So, something's wrong? What's going on? I've smeared drugs on the silver, did you see that? It's called "Drugged over the Mountain" If you touch it, your whole body will be weak. It's too late to throw it away now. I know how good you are, Xiao Li Flying Daggers. I had to use a trick. Who are you? Who sent you? I'm Hu Bugui, they called me the stingy madman, my specialty is in people trafficking. He paid us to catch you. Shangguan Fei. Your goods. Your money. Master Li, my work is done here. What happens to you next has nothing to do with me. You must hurry if you want to kill him. The drug will lose its power soon. Let's go. Jing Wuming told my father that he'd kill you. He didn't expect that I'd be quicker than him. Finally, I can show my father what I'm capable of. No, I'm the only one who can kill him. Jing Wuming, you... If you touch him, I'll kill you first. Shangguan Fei, because I've promised your father that I'll kill Li Xunhuan. No, you can't kill him either. Afei. I'm actually passing by, looking for Lin Xianer. You are the legendary Master Afei? Yes, I'm Afei. You look more like a scholar to me. I have a sword too. Don't Afei. He's Jing Wuming, Left-handed Sacred Knife; very swift. No matter how quick he is, he can't kill Master Li in front of me. You haven't fought anyone lately. How could you be distracted to save him when you're fighting me? Why don't you kill me? I'm not here to kill you. You're not my opponent today. We'll have a duel next time round. I heard that in the last few years, Jing Wuming has always killed those he wants dead. That's right, if my opponent wants to live, he has to kill me first. And I'm still alive. That's why they are all dead. You've said that you will kill me. Because I don't like to listen to Little Li's Legendary Dagger, Never a miss! Little Li's Legendary Dagger, Never a miss! It's how the martial world goes, I'm regretting now. Why do I have to be famous? Little Li's Legendary Dagger, Never a miss! Impressive. You blocked it. That's because you've only used 30% of your strength, or the dagger would have gone through my hand into my throat. Why didn't you kill me? First, I was drugged, I'm not in my best shape. Second, for returning the favor for you not killing Afei. Jing Wuming. Listen clearly. I don't take any favors, because I don't want to owe anyone. What he just did, he's damaged his veins and nerves. Yes, the Left-handed Sacred Knife, won't be able to use his left hand again. We haven't had a drink together for a while. Why did you go to town all of a sudden? After I left home with Xianer, we moved to an inn in town. One day I woke up, and there's no sign of Xianer. That's why I've been looking for her, and ran into you. And you? What were you doing there? I wanted to look for you, and I know it's the base of the Money Clan. I want to look for Shangguan Jinhong, but I ran into Hu Bugui instead. Sir. We didn't order anything to eat. How come? This is paid by the customer in the white clothes. May I ask your name? Have we met before? No. There're a few experts one must recognize, Li Xunhuan is one of those. Your name is... Lu Fengxian. The marquis with the silver halberd Master Lu in White Gown. Please join us for a drink. No, thank you. There're only a few people who could be my drinking mates. And here, only Master Li is qualified. There was another one, but he's dead. Unfortunately not in a duel, but in a woman's bed. Afei. Afei, Master Lu is ranked fifth. Stop it. I'd rather be dead And I want to know how slow my sword is. Afei. Your heart is dead, but not your sword. Next time if you want to drink with someone, you should have a duel first. Boss. Yes. I'll pay for his drinks. Yes. You're finally here. I have to thank you. You don't have to. It's a deal. You wanted me to lose to Afei. To revive him, sort of. And you'll do me a favor in return. That's right. But I haven't told you what. And now you can tell me. What if I want you to kill me? What a shame... The marquis with the silver halberd died ten years ago. But you... I'm talking about the marquis with the silver halberd, but Lu Fengxian isn't dead yet. Because Bai Xiaosheng ranked my silver halberd as fifth. I think it's an insult, that's why I've been practicing another weapon in the last ten years. Now I want to know where I'm ranked with the sword. You've been practicing for ten years, waiting for me. And lost to Afei on purpose, for this? That's correct. This is the favor you could return. Please. The martial arts world is strange. You fight for revenge, & you fight to pay gratitude. Watch! Xiaoli and the use of his paper fan is very dexterous. I'm sorry if I've offended you. Little Li's Legendary Dagger, Never a miss! Next time you can tell the others that Lu Fengxian is dead. Wait. Won't I see you in ten years' time? How many ten years has one got? I've used mine. I've been looking for you, where were you? How did you know I'm here? I hear you fought with Lu Fengxian here yesterday. That's how I've found you. Lin Xianer, you're here to take him away? Master Li, let's say he won't come with me. You think he'd go with you? Afei, I tried to find you because the martial arts world needs us now. What is it? The Money Clan bullies around, Shangguan Jinhong wanting to lead the martial world... What did I tell you? He only wants to use you. Lin Xianer. Forget it, let Afei go. Or do you want to ruin him? Do you want me to tell the truth? Stop it. Li Xunhuan, we are friends. But if you hurt her, we can't be friends. Afei, all these years... can't you see that she's been lying to you? She lives up to the rumors, she is not worth it. Shut up. For his remarks, you saw how I fought Lu Fengxian; but now, I don't want to fight you because of your insult. I knew, she only brought you misfortunes. How can you tell whether I'm blessed or not? And have you brought blessings to anyone? Have you forgotten there's someone... more lonely and unfortunate in Cold Fragrance Chamber? Master Li, can I leave with Afei now? Where are we going? I'll bring you to someone. He's Afei? That's right. Few years ago he ranked high as Xiaoli Flying Dagger. Didn't you say we're leaving the martial arts world? The safest place is in the Money Clan. Xiaoli could always find us before. But Xiaoli said the Money Clan... Do you still believe him? Afei, we're the biggest clan here. What is stopping you? Don't worry. He can follow me around. And he can be the number two of the clan. I can't use someone who can't use the knife. I can't let a piece of rubbish to manage the clan. Afei, after you've joined us, we are family. It's still dark? Xianer... Xianer. Open up, come on... You should have knocked. Give her back to me. You must kill me first. Everyone said that you're a real hero, but in the end, one ends up... a loser who puts a woman's life before your own. You want a woman? Fine, come with me. Go. This is our brothel. You want women? There're plenty here. Pretty one, a young one. So? No? She's older, but she's good in bed, have a go. Come on. No, move away. So? Are you scared? Have some wine. Drink up! You'll have courage after you're drunk. Xianer. Xianer... Why did you ask me to come here? Because you've asked me for a duel before. That's why we're here? Very true. Not only that you've taken my father away, you've replaced me. Since you've come along, you've taken everything away from me. Why didn't you kill me then? Because you could use your left hand then, and you were still useful. You were my father's knife, but now, you're nothing. Neither I nor my father would care if you're alive or dead now. Right, I know that. That's why I could kill you now. Too bad there's one thing you don't know. What's that? Only the dead know this secret. I'm alive, why are you telling me? Because you'll soon be dead. You want to kill me? How would you kill me? With your head? Or you'll try to bite me? No, my hand, my right hand. These are the names of 137 peoples I've killed. I haven't used my right hand in the last decade because it's full of bellicosity. And there's no space to write any more names, but I've found a space for your name. Your right hand. My right hand. It's a secret for the dead. There're often more disappointments than good things. It's time to drink again. Li Xunhuan, Li Xunhuan. What have you done in your life? What have you gained? You seem to have drunk too much tonight. Too bad the drinking won't help. Jing Wuming. You want to join me for a drink? No, I'm here to tell you, someone's drinking more than you are. Who? Afei. Wine... Wine... Wine? You want wine? Here you are. Officials, please. Chief Shangguan, please. Wine. Wine... This is for the guest, not for you. If you want a drink, go buy it on the street. Go on. Go. Xiaoli. The wine is better here. I'll pour you a cup. Why did you start drinking? I don't want to, but I have to. And when I drink, I have to get drunk. Right, sometimes it's necessary to get drunk. But when you're awake, you'll be more depressed. If you want to, go ahead. Afei. Master Li. You shouldn't be here at all, if you're leaving. While you're here, why should you leave? Right. You'll look for me no matter what. Where's your dagger? Your rings? I haven't used them for ten years. Impressive... It's wonderful, there's no me without the rings. No sign of it, but it's all-conquering. No wonder you're ranked second. Thank you. Li Xunhuan, you ranked third in Imperial Exam, you have fame and fortune, what's the point of... being in the martial arts world? I don't want to, but I have to. Well said. Come. Let me drink to you. Thank you. Please. Master Li, there's no wine in the cup. If you want a drink, come and get it. This is not bad. Master Li, the cup is here, please. Of course. Here. Catch. Thank you, chief. I've wanted to drink for a while. You... Delivery, delivery. Hu Bugui? Who are you? I'm Hu Bugui, my specialty is in people trafficking. Master Li knows me. I want to sell you something. What kind of goods? A person of course. A dead person. Who? Pay up, one thousand taels. - What? - Nonsense. Stop it. Bring one thousand taels. Yes, chief. Two thousand. Why? You'd be curious to know the murderer's name. He's a person too. Alright, two thousand. Yes. Very generous. Shangguan Fei? Who killed him? Tell me, who killed my son? Who killed my son? He did. Jing Wuming. That's right Kill him for me now. I'll pay you ten thousand taels... Wait, the reason why I'm still alive is because I know what jobs I can take, and what I can't. Sometimes there's no use to earn money, because dead people can't use money, good day. Hu Bugui... You seem quite generous, here's a free tip for you. He killed your son with his right hand. Right hand? Can you use your right hand to kill? Yes, and it's faster than my left hand. But if you want a revenge, I won't use either hands. Revenge? Son? You're my son now. I've raised you, and sent you to learn martial arts. I've always treated you like my own son. Did you hear me clearly? I've killed your son. You're saying... the one lying on the ground is my son? No, he's a dead person. He can't help me to dominate the martial arts world. He can't hold a sword. Of what use is he now? He used to bleed my blood, but now, he has no blood left, he's got nothing to do with me. You're my son now, Jing Wuming. Money Clan is ours from now on. Trust him, Jing Wuming. It's how the martial arts world works. Who's useful, then he's the son. I live in Maple Inn outside the town. Pick a time and place, and let me know. Grandfather, look. Afei? "7 am, snow capped mountain summit- hangguan Jinhong. " Master Li... Afei is still not awake, he was really drunk yesterday. Getting drunk is strange. One will wake up when it's time. And one will get drunk when it's time. Jing Wuming and Shangguan Jinhong will be there, but you're going on your own. He invited me alone. Afei... why are you still sleeping? It's almost time, I should get going. Master Li... Xiaohong. Are you going to look for Shangguan Jinhong? How did you know I'm here? Shangguan Jinhong sent someone to tell me. He meant well. Strange. Why does it snow every time I see you? To see you off. Perhaps it knows that it's parting time Thank you. It's late, I should get going. Hope it won't be another parting... the next time we see each other. Take care. Will I see you again, Cousin Xunhuan? I don't know. Shangguan Jinhong is really evil, one must be focused before a duel. Miss Lin, you shouldn't be here right now. I'm here to look for someone. Wine... Miss Lin. What are you doing here? It's Xiaoli's duel against Shangguan Jinhong & Wuming. I'm here to say goodbye. Why? I heard from Xiaoli that, One will wake up when it's time. And one will get drunk when it's time. These are the clothes you left in my house years ago, I remembered you wore them, went to Xingyun Manor on your own, and saved Xiaoli at night. You fought the Plum Blossom Bandit in the forest. I've brought them here, hoping they'd still fit. Master Afei, your sword. My... hand. You're awaken from the drunkenness. Afei, you can't go. What are you doing here? I'm here to bring you out of this place. I'll make it up to you for what I've done wrong in the past. I love you, don't go and get killed along with Xiaoli. Afei, the martial arts world needs you, you must go. Hero Afei, you still trust her? Afei, you can't be drunk for your whole life. Don't listen to him, Afei. Afei, you... I wonder... how could I fall for someone like you? Afei... The summit of the snow-capped mountain, 7 A.M. Brave indeed to stick by your word! Where's Afei? You invited me only, it's nothing to do with Afei. This sword was Guo Songyang's. Two weapons against two weapons, that's more fair. Fair? I guess you're still young, there's only fame & fortune in the martial arts world, there's no fairness. At least I'm blessed today to see the Dragon Phoenix Rings in action. But you won't be seeing them for long. You can take a few dozens strokes from us, Bai Xiaosheng should rank you as third. Sometimes that ranking doesn't mean anything, it matters more in public opinion. Master Li, you don't have a chance today. I advise you to leave now, and live as a hermit. Can I? After I made a name I've left the martial arts world. Too bad your reputation is still here. In the end, people would come to you. Jing Wuming, maybe you're still young. You have no idea that after one has become famous, he's like a boat, you will always go with the flow. When you want to go east, it goes west. When you want to go south, it goes north. Everything will turn out the opposite of what you want. Take me for example, the reputation Little Li's Legendary Dagger has given me troubles, and I have nothing left except a bottle of wine and my constant coughing. I've lost all my friends, my lover... We think differently. You'd never think of ruling the martial arts world. You haven't thought about being number one. Otherwise you'll be like me. You've got a lot on hand, plenty of people to kill. Jing Wuming, our clan's future lies in this battle, what are you doing standing there? Li Xunhuan, who would have thought... this bottomless abyss is where you'll be buried. Kill! Afei, you... You've said that one will wake up when it's time. Jing Wuming, did you say that we could have a duel sometime? That's right. How about here and now? Certainly. Legend has it that Afei is very skilled, it's true. But legend has it that you only use your left hand, that's not true. Xiaoli, how about a deal? Kill Jing Wuming now, and I'll let you replace him, we can co-rule the Money Clan, what do you think? First, I don't like to be an adopted son. Second, you should have made me the offer in front of Jing Wuming when I first arrived. This... Third, I've never seen anyone as despicable as you in my life. Chief. For not killing me the other day. Pick up your knife, get up. Jing Wuming, kill him... I'll be with you for the rest of my life. I'll make you very happy. Lin Xianer, are you human or an animal? No matter what, I want you both dead. Jing Wuming, kill them... I'll love you forever, kill them for me. Why? How could you? No man would kill me, how could you? Because they carry sentimental swords, and mine is a knife that shears off all emotion. It's so quiet now, it seems like everything has stopped. It seems like everything is in the past. Why didn't you kill us for him? Kill you? The only point to kill you two is to help him to accomplish his goal to rule the world, in order to repay him for raising me. But he's dead now, there's no reason to kill you two. Jing Wuming, where are you going? You've just said that one is like a boat in the martial arts world, I'm only sailing with the flow. I have no idea where I'm going. It's cold & frosty, who'll take pity on a lofty spirit? Tricks and twists, it's dangerous to be ranked top. Bai Xiaosheng has edited his list. Little Li's Legendary Dagger, Number one. Jing Wuming & Afei, both at Number two. Ripped by: SkyFury
