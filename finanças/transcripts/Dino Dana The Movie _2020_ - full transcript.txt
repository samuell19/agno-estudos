Let's make a discovery. I think I've got something. [gasps] Well, what are we standing around for? I believe we just found ourselves a dinosaur. [all cheer] Since our founding, the American Museum of Natural History has had one mission, to discover, interpret, and share knowledge about human cultures, the natural world, and the universe. And Mr. Barnum Brown has made quite the discovery. [audience applauding] Thank you, Mr. Osborn. Dinosaur, is a combination of two Greek words. Dinos, meaning terrible, and sauros, meaning lizard. Well, there can be no terrible lizard, than the one we are unveiling for you today. I give you, the Tyrannosaurus rex. [audience awing] [audience applauding] Dana, what are you doing? And get off the couch. But mom, we're imagining we're Barnum Brown. And Henry Fairfield Osborn. Oh, well then, please continue wearing shoes on the furniture. I don't think you understand. They're the most famous dinosaur fossil collectors of all time. Barnum discovered the first Tyrannosaurus rex! Really? Did he also put groceries away? But he didn't name it. Henry Fairfield Osborn did. He was the President of the American Museum of Natural History. I did not know that. Well, do you know what the name T-Rex means? Hmm, king of the dinosaurs? You're mostly, wrong. It means tyrant lizard king but don't be too upset with yourself, mom. Henry and Barnum got a lot of the things about the T-Rex wrong too. Like, they thought it was more like a lizard than a bird. And that it's little arms were weak, not strong. And that it stood like this, not this. That's what I love about science. Every mistake leads to a new discovery. Well, I just discovered cheese on circular bread! I'm going to call it, pizza. Riley, you staying for lunch? Can't, going to my grandmas. Bye Dana. Next time, I get to blow up the mountain. Okay. Can you let Saara know lunch will be ready soon? Is she still? Yes. [soft knocking] [Saara sighs] Seester? [Saara] Please leave. It's my room too. Then leave my side. What are you wear-- Never mind. Lunch will be ready soon. I'm not hungry. But it's pizza! You can use the pepperoni to make a happy face. Or a sad one. [rustling and exhaling] Have you-- Don't ask. Don't. [sighs] You know, when dinosaurs-- How can I get you to understand? [deep breath] Okay. Close your eyes. You know how you love dinosaurs? Yes. What are you doing? ♪ ♪ -Dana! -I'm listening. What are your two favorite dinosaurs? -Currently? -Yes. It's just that they change, depending on when-- Just choose two. ♪ ♪ [gasps] Can one of them be a prehistoric winged reptile? They're technically not dinosaurs, so I-- Sure, whatever. [squawking and roaring] ♪ ♪ The Tyrannosaurs Rex and the Quetzalcoatlus. The pretzel, what? The Quetzalcoatlus is the largest flying creature of all time. It flew by jumping in the air and may have built it's nests on the side of a mountain. Great. Now close your eyes again and think of your two favorites. ♪ ♪ [dinosaurs roaring and screeching] Now, pick the one that you don't get to see anymore. Huh? Saara, I can't do that. Exactly. Now you know how I feel. I have to choose between my two families. [phone ringing] It's my mom. My other mom. Oh. [phone ringing] [door latching] Hey. Dana! Give your sister some privacy. She's got a tough decision to make. [whispers] Did you hear anything? No. I hope she stays. Me too. Listen, there's still a few minutes before lunch. -Why don't you do a-- -Dino experiment? [chuckling] How do you choose which one? It's more like they choose me. [chuckles] Dino experiment 9-0-1. Where are all the kid dinosaurs? Hmm. Interesting. [grunting] Let the dino experiment begin! [roars] [sniffing and grunting] Hey Pachycephalosaurus! You're full grown. Where are your kids? [grunting] [grunts] No. That's a Stygimoloch. I'm looking for you but smaller. [grunting] [roars] No again. That's a Drake rex. Can't you see how different you all look? [dinosaurs roaring] Pachycephalosaurus, your name means thick headed lizard because, well, you have a thick head. [grunts] But do you know what you don't have that both the Stygimoloch and Drake rex do? Spikes. So, they can't be your kids because you wouldn't lose spikes as you grow older, you'd grow more. Paleontologists have discovered over 800 different species of dinosaurs but they're mostly grownups and a few babies. The question is, where are all the kid dinos? [grunts] Tyrannosaurus rex! [roars] [grunting] Ugh. [roars] [grunts] Not again! Ugh. [roars] Thanks, T-Rex, you just scared off my research subjects. [tyrannosaurus rex grunting] What about you? What does a kid T-Rex look like? Close. A nanotyrannus' name does mean dwarf tyrant because they were so little but I need to find a young T-Rex, not a smaller tyrannosaur. [roars] [grunting] What got into her? [growls] Wait up, nano! Maybe you can lead me to the kid dinos! [squawks] Stop! I said, wait up! Not hurry up! Dana? Oh. Hi dad! Hi, Dexie! Let me guess, dino experiment. Yeah and it's a tough one. Dino experiment 9-0-1, where are all the kid dinosaurs? We got one right here! Tyrannosaurus Dex. [laughs] That's a baby. I'm looking for dinosaurs that are old as me or Saara. Well, if they're anything like your sister, they're probably sitting in their room trying to figure out if they're gonna break their dad's heart! Sorry, supposed to be supportive. It's just hard because I don't want her to go. How do we make her choose to stay? Look, Sarra's lucky, she's got two great families. It's just too bad that one of them has to move away somewhere awesome for work. Yeah. You know what else is too bad? What? You not solving your dino experiment. I think I need to call some friends. Which friends? It's not gonna be long distance, is it? Uh. [chuckles] [phone ringing] Royal Tyrrell Museum, Trek Henderson, speaking. Dino experiment 9-0-1? Hold on, might need big brother on this too. Alrighty folks, we're gonna have to pick up the pace. Okay, so, these are Albertosaurus, they stay together in packs, which is what we're gonna do. No stragglers! The Shonisaurus Sikanniensis. The world's biggest marine reptile. Imagine swimming with that guy, but imagine, while we're walking. The Borealopelta Markmitchelli, the world's best preserved Ankylosaur. Check out that armor, huh, check it out quickly! Ornithomimus, one of the world's fastest dinosaurs. Like we need to be! [winding and grinding] [knocking] Dino experiment 9-0-1. That's a tough one. Did you solve it? [chuckles] No, there's so many competing theories. For starters, there's a theory that if they didn't become grownups, kid dinosaurs were probably eaten by predators. So, there'd be no fossils left to find. Maybe you don't wanna be a dinosaur. [giggling] There's also the idea that paleontologists used to only care about finding the big dinosaurs. So, they left all the little fossils behind. But my favorite theory is that fossils that belonged to different dinosaurs might actually belong to the same dinosaur, just at different ages. Wouldn't paleontologists notice that the two fossils look the same? Not necessarily. Paleontologists love to find things and name them. Everybody wants to discover a brand new dinosaur. I know I do! Me too, but if you only look at what's different between two fossils. Or two brothers. You might not realize they're family. But if that's true, that means some dinosaurs wouldn't exist anymore. Exactly. Some paleontologists think that we could lose dozens. Every dinosaur book would have to be rewritten. That's not good. Science is all about asking questions even if you're afraid of the answers. Hmm. How do we solve it? One way would be to get dinosaurs from the same family group together and see how they behave. If they try to kill each other, they're probably not related. But if they don't, they can be the same dinosaur! Just at different ages. Right. Thanks, Dan and Trek. -No problem. -Let us know how it goes. [Dana] Will do! -I'll see you at lunch. -Awesome. All right, next up, the Tyrannosaurus rex. The world's largest Tyrannosaur. Check it's mouth. Can you guess how many teeth it has? I know what I need to do. Not so fast nugget! First lunch, then experimenting. But dad! If you don't eat lunch then you'll go extinct. Come on, that was a good joke. Dexter liked it. It was a meteor. -Hi. -Hi. Hey. We're finally getting new neighbors. Huh, I'm gonna go say, hi. Maybe let 'em settle in first? Or walk in uninvited. Either works. -Hey. -Hi. -Amin. -Aisha. -This is Dexter. -Hi, Dexter! We live downstairs. -Oh, great! -Nice to meet you. You too. Hello? Hello. Hello! Is this? -Sue? -No, I'm Jadiel. No, is this a model of Sue? The famous T-Rex. -How did you-- -Your front door was open. Wait, did you get this at the Field Museum in Chicago? Yes. The actual museum where Sue is on display? -You were there? -I've been to lots of museums. That's number two in my top 33 dinosaur museums I wanna visit! What else did you get? Who are you? Dana, we live beneath you. Can you imagine, discovering one of the most famous fossils of all time? [sighs] -What are you doing? -Imagining. It's one of my favorite things to do. [gasps] Let me show you! [grunting] Picture this. It's 1990, we're just about to leave after a summer of digging for dinosaur bones. Who's we? You get to be Sue Hendrickson, the famous fossil hunter, and I'll be Peter Larson, the leader of the expedition. ["Ice Ice Baby" by Vanilla Ice] ♪ Let's kick it!

You don't see it? See what? Zuul. A 76 million year old dinosaur? No, I don't. Do you wanna know why? Because it's not 76 million years ago. This is my dino field guide, it's supposed to let you see dinosaurs. For real. Well, special powers don't seem to work on me. Now, give me back my bike. Why did it work on Mateo and not you? Maybe because I believe in science, not magic. Science is magic. Science is the opposite of magic. Science is about facts. But where do facts come from? They come from scientists who have imagined things that no one else has ever thought of before. I'm working on a dino experiment right now that can change what we know about dinosaurs forever. That, to me, is magical. But before I can make history, I need to save your brother. I mean, step-brother. You forgot your magic book. [Dana] I'll get it from you later!

Almost there! -Thanks. -It's okay. I've got you, you're safe. You stink, but you're safe. I wanna go home. I know, let's go. [tyrannosaurus rex roaring] [roaring and crunching] You wanna stay around and see who wins? A bit. [dinosaurs roaring] Will she be okay, Dana? Oh, I hope so. [dinosaurs roaring] [Mateo] Why did she puke on me? She wasn't puking, exactly. She was regurgitating food for you. That's how some birds, like penguins, feed their babies. I guess T-Rexes weren't just tyrants. They were good moms too. Moms can be tyrants. Especially when protecting her babies. Wait, does that mean when you puke up to feed the baby? What do you mean, the baby? -Nothing. -Mateo! I couldn't just leave him there, he could've gotten eaten. [baby tyrannosaurus rex chirping] You didn't. [sighs] You did. [distant thud] [distant rumbling and chirping] Dana? [murmuring] Huh, she really does love dinosaurs. And me. These must be the experiments she wanted us to do together. I really should have helped her out with more of these. [rustling and murmuring] [Dana] Come on. Do you think if we make loud noises, he'll go? Come on. You know what, I don't need to know. Hi, I'm Saara, our parents are out with yours. They'll be home soon. Dana, can I talk to you for a second? He's coming out! [chirping] What was that? You heard it? A baby T-Rex. A baby T-Rex? Really? Of course. And how did it get here? It's a long story. I'm out. Dana? I got taken by a mama T-Rex, who thought I was her baby, then a Spinosaurus tried to eat me. But a whole herd of Triceratops ran over to us and we got away. The mom T-Rex had a baby T-Rex that Mateo took with him even though he shouldn't have. I didn't want Toby to get eaten. [both] You named him? -We can't keep him. -We're not gonna touch-- [talking over each other] [Saara] Okay! Stop. You guys need to grow up and quit pretending you see dinosaurs everywhere. Maybe you need to grow down and start believing we're dealing with some serious stuff too. Super serious. Dana, I wish I could live in a world where everything you imagine becomes real. I really do. But we live in the real world. And in the real world there are no more... [squawks] Dinosaurs. You wanna take anything back? But that's not possible. No, it's magical. Are you playing a trick on me? Is that a toy? [chirping] [Mateo] He's on the run! [Dana] It's okay, baby T-Rex. We're not gonna hurt you! [chirps] He's trying to hide again. What is happening? Baby dinosaurs, like baby birds, learn to hide when they think they're in danger. No, like, what is happening, right now? You're growing down. My dino field guide, lets people see dinosaurs, but only if they want to. I guess you want to see them. I wanted to spend more time with you before I-- We need to get that baby back to it's mom. Unless we can't find his mom. Then we're gonna have to feed Toby our puke. What? I'm calling mom and dad. They won't believe you. [phone ringing] -Yeah, anyway. -Right. Hey, Saara. Did you talk with Dana? Why not? Oh, T-Rex under the bed. -Oh yeah. -Of course, makes sense. [Amin] No, no, you should definitely take it back to it's mother. [laughing] Can Jadiel and Mateo go with you to the park? -Yeah, that's fine with me. -They say, yes. When are you gonna talk to-- Thanks, sweetie, love you too! Well, I wouldn't say I'm the best dad in the world but definitely top. She hung up on you, didn't she? Yeah, like 10 seconds ago. Yeah, they didn't believe me. I tried to tell you. A lot of grownups forget how to see the magic in science. I hope that never happens to me. Me too. [chirps] [Mateo] Look, there he is! I still don't know if this is actually happening. But... okay. Let's get this baby back to it's mother T-Rex. Everyone, grab a box. [rustling and screaming] I got him! Ah! [chirps] Yah! [sighing] Ah! Come here! Come here, baby dino! Toby, it's me! I got him, I got him. [chirps] [sighs] Maybe he doesn't wanna go back to his mom. Maybe he wants to stay with us. [chirps] No, he's just worried we're predators trying to eat him. We're not trying to eat you, little brother. Brother? Think, Dana, think. Some bird brothers and sisters take care of each other and since-- Birds came from dinosaurs... Maybe dino brothers and sisters take care of each other too. Yeah. It's T-Rex time. Ugh. Dana. Over there. [chirps] [Dana cooing] [Dana] Okay, little friend. We're gonna get you back to your mom. Would you like that? [chirps] I thought you would. [chirps] You're safe. [cooing] [chirps] Good boy. [applauding] Wow! Yeah! You're amazing! You did it. Nice job. [Dana] What are T-Rex sisters for? Now, let's get our little friend back to his mom, so you can help me finish dino experiment 9-0-1. Where are all the kid dinosaurs? Saara, you said you wanted to spend more time with me. But, don't we have a kid right there? This is a baby, not a kid. I'll explain on the way. Come on, Toby. So, for dino experiment 9-0-1, my working theory is that some smaller dinosaurs are actually kid versions of bigger dinosaurs. [Saara]That would mean they're the same dinosaur. [Jadiel] Which means some dinosaurs wouldn't exist anymore. But, I don't want them to go away. They wouldn't go away, it's just our old ideas about them would. Think of it more like they're finding their families, just like we're about to do for Toby. [chirps] We're almost there. Where's mama T-Rex? She's gone. But that means. We're Toby's family now. Mateo, we can't just become it's family. Why? Because we're different. We're from different families and now we're a family. [chirps] Yeah, but not really. We're step-brothers not real brothers. Just like-- Mateo! Where are you going? [chirps] [Dana] Mateo don't go! [chirps] He does this, taking off. How 'bout you two keep looking for the mom T-Rex. I'll go get Mateo. [sighing] [chirps] [sighing] He didn't wanna be my brother. But at least I have you. I'm okay, Toby. Sometimes I think being a dinosaur would be easier than being a person. Less feelings. Yeah. You know, when my dad left, my mom was sad for a long time. Me too. But then, my mom met Saara's dad and she was happy again, and I met Saara and she hated me. Only in the beginning because I would take her stuff, follow her around, and copied what she liked. I loved my new big seester. Why do you call her seester? [Saara] I made it up. Because I didn't know what else to call her other than annoying. [sighs] And I didn't wanna get too used to her in case they didn't stay. But, one day I realized that whatever happens, nothing is going to change the fact that Dana is always going to be my little seester. Not even moving. You decided? I have another part of my family I have to think about and-- I get it. We should get back to finding Toby's mom. [chirps] Maybe being a dinosaur would be easier. Come on, Toby. [chirps] It's okay, Toby, we'll find your mom. [dinosaur grunting] [chirps] What is it, Toby? Toby, there's your mom! She's hurt. -How bad? -Pretty bad. [low rumbling] [Mateo] Poor mama T-Rex. [dinosaurs grunting] Your mom's gonna be okay, baby. What are we gonna do? Whatever it is, let's make it fast. What is that? [dinosaur squawking] Whoa! Quetzalcoatlus. [screeching] I thought you said they were the largest flying thing of all time? They are. [Mateo] What is it doing? Why is it coming over here? I think it knows she's too weak to protect herself or her baby. [dinosaur roaring] It's not the only one! [roars] A nanotyrannus! Another tyrannosaur. Great, so won't it help the T-Rex tyrannosaur? Nope, they're different. And tyrannosaurs are known to fight each other. Think, Dana, think. [growls] [Saara] Think faster! We have to do something. [roars] Too late. [distant squawking] [squawks] [Mateo] Toby, watch out! Mateo, don't look. [Dana] What do we do? [squawks] Mateo, look. I thought I wasn't supposed to. Look! [dinosaurs screeching] He's helping mama T-Rex! [Dana] This doesn't make any sense. Why is the Nanotyrannus helping the mama and baby T-Rex? They're not from the same family. Wait. We were too focused on what made them different to see what made them the same! It's dino experiment 9-0-ah! -Saara! -Dana! [screaming] Saara! [screaming] I got you. Me too! Me three and Toby makes four. Don't let go! [screaming] Hold on tight! -Dana! -Saara! Saara, help me! Follow that-- Quetzalcoatlus! Yes! [chirps] I gotta go, Toby. You look after your mommy until she's better. I have to help my new friend. [Jadiel] Come on, Mateo. [chirps] [grunting] [Dana screaming] Hurry! Saara! [Jadiel] There she is. [Dana] Saara! It's too fast for us. [Dana] Help! We need to come up with another plan. [Dana] Where are you taking me? Where is it taking her? I don't know but maybe we should call our parents again. Yeah, that'll work. Uh, hey dad, a giant flying dinosaur took Dana, can we go look for her? Uh, sure kids, have fun! Technically it's a pterosaur. Not helpful. How do we get her back? What would Dana do? Think, Saara, think. [sighing] You could think too. Oh, well, what do we know about Quetzalcoatlus? They're super big. -Yes! -And really tall. Kind of the same thing. They build their nests on mountains. Dana told me that. Do you think it's taking her to it's nest? That's where mama T-Rex took me. But there are no mountains around here. There's no mountains but there is a building that looks like a mountain. And here she is, the Quetzalcoatlus, the largest flying creature ever discovered. [Kids] Whoa! [tour guide] Yeah, whoa! Paleontologists think it plucked dinosaurs right off the ground, but it would have had to pluck a lot of dinosaurs because this prehistoric winged creature was as tall as a giraffe. [Kids] Whoa! [Dana] Why are you taking me to the museum? [tour guide] Did you guys know it's wings were as long as a bus? How long do you think it's beak is? Help! Hello? Anyone! [squawks] [roars] [screaming] [Dana] Help me! Help! [Dana screaming] You were right. -Follow me. -Where? Up there. And if you thought the Quetzalcoatlus was big, wait until you see our Tyrannosaurus rex. Let's go! -Which way? -This way. [squawks] [Dana screams] [squawks] What do you want? You're not trying to eat me, so what are you trying to do? [squawks] What are you doing? I'm not for you, am I? [long squawk] I'm for them! [grunting] At least they haven't started... [crackling] Hatching! [Saara] We have to hurry. [Jadiel] How many more stairs? [Saara] A lot! [crackling and screeching] [screams] You don't wanna eat me. [screehing and chirping] Dana! There she is. We have to get to her. [Jadiel] Come on, Mateo. [squawks] I'm not gonna be baby food. [roaring squawk] [screeching] Get off of me! [panting] Hurry! I think we're almost there. [baby quetzalcoatlus screeching] [grunting] [grumbles and squawks] [Dana] Oh. You're not one of those parents who cut up their kids' food are you? Oh, you are! Saara you found me! Dinosaurs aren't the only ones who look after their brothers and-- [squawks] Sisters. Thanks, seester. What's the plan? Plan? [squawking and screaming] [gasping] Leave my friends alone! [squawks] Hey you, I wouldn't do that if I was you! I know you're just doing what you need to do for your family, Quetzalcoatlus. [squawking] But I'm doing what I need to do for mine. So, we both have a choice to make, we can both lose something we care about or we can let each other go. [grunts] Mateo, Dana, Saara, head to the exit. Come on. [Dana] Jadiel! Keep going! Go! Come on, Jadiel! I'll follow you. Ah-ah-ah, not until they're at the door. As long as I have this, I wouldn't step any closer. [screeches] Ugh. Yeah, so, about our deal. [squawks] [screaming] I got you! [squawks] Come on, Dana. Come on, come on, come on! [squawks] -Dana, Jadiel, hurry! -We're coming! Come on, faster! [grunting] [quetzalcoatlus squawking] Nice try! [roars] Nice job, seester. Yeah, thanks. We all make a pretty good dino team, huh? [chuckling] And you were right, Saara. We'll always be seesters. Even if you move away. Or I get taken by a Quetzalcoatlus to teach her babies how to feed. [laughing] [phone ringing] It's Dad. -Hey. -Hey, Saara. Where are you guys? Still playing dinos? Yeah, we just finished playing. Okay, well, we invited our new neighbors for dinner. So, hurry back. Gonna miss her hanging up on me. Time to go home. Let's go, come on. Check it out. Three different bird skulls. So what? No, they're all from the same type of bird, just at different ages. Baby, kid, grownup. But they don't look the same. The kid and the grownup have different things on their head. Yeah, the grownups crest is totally different. Maybe we need to stop looking at what things different and start looking at what makes the same. I agree. I think we're close to solving our dino experiment. [Saara] Aren't you sad that some of these dinos won't be here anymore? They'll still be here. Just with different names. That's one of my favorite things about science. You can think you know something, then you discover something new, and what you thought you knew has suddenly changed. [sighs] Thanks, Dad. Sounds like you four went on a pretty big adventure. It was huge! Jadiel had to save me, like, three times. Three times? Great job, Jadiel. He saved me too. Thanks, little bro. Oh, and Dana, shouldn't we get going? We still have to finish our dino experiment. Dino experiment? [Dana] We're trying to figure out where all the kid dinosaurs went. Okay, well, don't get eaten by a T-Rex. Don't worry, she thinks I'm her baby. [laughing] Saara, are you coming? Hold on, Dana. Dad? Could I talk to you for a second? -It's important. -Sure. You're making me nervous. Now, I know I told you that I was going to stay with my mom. [murmuring] [clears throat] Sorry. No, do you hear anything? Not yet. But, some stuff happened today that made me realize how important it is for brothers and sisters to look after each other. [whispers] I can't hear anything. Hold on, maybe if I open the door. And to keep each other safe. Wait, are you saying? I've changed my mind, I'm staying. Is that okay? Of course it's okay. If it's your decision. -Mm-hm. -Then it's great! [laughing] [baby giggling] Whoa. I told you dino experiments can help you figure out stuff. [dinosaurs groaning] Look! The Pachycephalosaurus is with the Stygimoloc and the Dracorex. And they're not trying to kill each other. [dinosaurs grunting] So, does that mean-- They're the same dinosaur! Just different sizes. The Dracorex is the baby, the Stygimoloc is the kid, and the Pachycephalosaurus is the grownup. But they look so different. We look different and we're from the same family. Yeah. Look, they all walk on two legs, have really short arms, and have really cool heads. And they're all herbivores. [dinosaurs roaring] Mama T-Rex! She made it! [Saara] And there's the Nanotyrannus. Wanna give solving this one a try, Mateo? The mama T-Rex is a grownup, the Nanotyrannus is a kid, and-- [chirps] Toby! Is the baby. What are you smiling about? [dinosaurs grunting and rumbling] Because science really is magical. But, so is family. I wonder how many more dinosaurs are the same. There's only one way to find out. Dino experiment 9-0-1 continues. Come on! Woo-hoo! [all cheer] [Mateo] Toby, wait up! [dinosaur groaning] [screeching] ♪ ♪
