Happy holidays, Dune! Thank you, Jean-Marc. You too. - Keep working on your apnoea diving. - Yes, yes. It's funny, the little drops don't run down like they used to. When I was little, they very quickly ran down to my feet. Monday, July 26, 2021 I think I'm almost a teenager. Tomorrow, we're off to Seignosse. We haven't been there in two years. They didn't tell me why. Anyway, Mom and Dad never tell me anything. But I can see they're not like they used to be. They pretend nothing's changed. THAT SUMMER Dune, get your nose out of your book. Actually, I was sleeping, Dad. We'll be there soon. We're about... two kilometers away, Dune. Two kilometers from the factory that stinks. Well, more like... ... about 1.5, plus or minus. Yes, plus or minus, plus or minus, about 1.5. It's 8 o'clock. Let's see... We'll pass the factory that stinks of death. And mom doesn't say anything. Like she's not even there. It's July 27. Oh no, the 28th. We've been driving all night. Oh! Eh! Ha ha ha! Damn! It stinks, no? Oof! Horrible, isn't it? Can you smell it, Sarah? You do smell it, don't you? No, not really, no. But I do remember. Sorry, sorry. Oh, who can't feel anything because,... let's see... come here, you leper! - Stop! - Hey, Granny! - Oh, come on, listen! Do you realise how childish that is? It's completely stupid! Of course! Otherwise I wouldn't do it. - I hate it when you do that. - I do what I want. - I love you. - Ah yes, that's easy, isn't it? Me too. - What? - Me too. Me too, I... Me too, I... Me too, I... Oh, you're a pain! A little bit of love. A little bit. Come on, now. - Crowded, isn't it? - Yes, it is. It's funny to be back here, isn't it? I'll be right back. I hate this place. Well... you buy 2 kilos of blue stuff here every summer, since you were born. - You love this place. - Skulls? - Yeah. - But it used to be different. Hey, isn't that Buzette's son, the pedal boat king? - Have a look. Yellow T-shirt. - Yes, that's him. That guy's creepy. I'll never go there again. Is there anything you don't find sketchy right now? Well, you don't like anything anymore and I say nothing. I leave you alone. Hi, girls! How are you? - I'm fine, and you? - Yeah. - Hello. - Hello. Well, why did he buy two? You can freeze them. - And the allures. - The what? The allures. - For fishing. - Say, "lures." - Huh? - "Lures." Leeeuuuuuurrrrres. Since when do you fish? No, not anymore. I don't know... One has medicines... ... and is not sick, a first-aid kit. I don't know. No, no. I thought it was pretty. Like my cabin. The art of waste. Do you know what Gabriel García Márquez says? So long ago! Oh, well, sorry! He says... "Things have a life of their own." "You just have to know that it's just a matter of awakening their souls." - So? - I want to awaken souls with these lures. Lures. It's going to be the best summer of our lives. Eh? Eh? Help! It's dangerous to say, "This will be the best summer of our lives." Ah, pardon me. I'm sorry. I thought it was a wasp. Excuse me. Stop filming. Is there be any bread around here? Wait, don't do that. Shit, it's heavy. - Don't drop it. - I'm exceptionally strong. Let's go. - One, two... - Wait. Three! Damn, your sink weighs a ton. It's been two years since you walked through that door, mom. I wish I could go back to before then. To when I ate a weird flower with Mathilde. Milkweed. We believed it was a magic flower that made it possible to fly. But actually, no. It's a flower with no power. You're lucky! Are you hurt? Yeah, I almost busted both my feet. - We got yelled at. - It was worth it. No? - It was good. - We even threw up. So, what do we say? Thank you, who? Thank you, Thiago. I'm going to see Mathilde. - Don't forget your helmet. - Yes, yes. Ah, yuck. Here, we'll try to align our hands and feet. Hi, how are you? - You cut your hair? Big time. - Yeah, at Christmas last year. - Is that a cell phone? - Only in September. I could make the best movies with one. Seriously. - Is your grandmother here? - Yeah, she's sleeping. - She came home at 5 o'clock this morning. - As usual. Yeah. She loves life. - And Claude, have you heard? - What? He's dead? Worse. Er... He destroyed the barn. - No! - Yeah, we don't have it anymore. Oh, and also, I have a flat tire. Can I ride with you? - Come on, I'll take you. - Could your father fix my bike for me? I don't know if he has time. You know, he's going on a road trip to America by himself. - A road with a well-known number, I believe. - Yeah. I'm glad to see you. - Mom's well? - Yeah, fine. - Well, elaborate a bit. - No, nothing more. She's fine. - I have a new sink. - Oh well, great! - Have you girls had beet juice? - No, it's okay. I'm not thirsty. That's not the point. It's for pinworms. We're changing moons tomorrow, so I can tell you that intestinal worms are everywhere. No, but I don't have worms. I know, at your age, you don't want to know, but you've got thousands of worms in your belly that you can't feel. Thousands of them! But you shouldn't be disgusted, you know. It's natural. But I'm not disgusted. I even swim with baby swimmers, so uh... - Shall we go, Dune? If not, it'll take two hours. - Yeah. I'm not sure, but I think it was Homo Sapiens who created the big trees. Really? Are you doing a sailing course before you arrive in Brittany? I did apnoea diving in Lyon. That's when you can't wait to breathe. - There were only children of homos there. - Really? Yeah. My mother was dumped by a Japanese florist, so she put me in the homo kids' group. I don't see the connection. Did your mom, like, want to settle down again? Yeah, right at the station she was looking for a single lesbian. "Hello, ma'am! Are you free for vegan McDonald's tonight?" "Yes! We'll drink beet juice for our earthworms." "And forever, we'll eat seeds and white stuff." What's the white stuff called again? Tofu! Come on, faster! You're so lucky to have a lesbian mother. - Mine no longer has a job. - She's unemployed? Yeah. It looks like her nose is really dead. She's become so weird. - That sucks for her line of work. - Yes. Remember when we uprooted a tree here one day? Yeah, but I don't think we did it on purpose.. Yes, we did! We wanted to extend the path to our cabin. Yeah, maybe. We were serious. Ah, my chicks! They are there. Dune, you're a real beanpole now! - Did you get the bread? - Yeah, thanks. But actually, we'd already bought some. I'll give it to you for the chickens. But when did blue Citroën DS disappear from the barn? We used to stash stuff in the back seat when we were kids. I gave it to Roland's son for spare parts. - That carcass was useless. - Ah well, yeah, but still. Oh no, it was rotten. It's like that, you know. When it's too old, we scrap it. Hi, Pompon! - Hey, Mom is okay? - Yes, yes. It looks like someone's living in the barn. Ah well, I've put in a fridge and some plates, a quiche... uh... ... quiche... kiche... Kitchenette. Nette. Quiche nette, yes. Because I'm lodging a little seasonal worker who didn't have much money. Margaux. And she's been here since May. A brave girl. Well, speak of the devil, Margaux is off to do her duty. ClauClau, I'm going to get you a liter of milk, because I've run out, and the one in the shack is disgusting. - Hi, girls. - Hi. I, Margaux, present Mathilde and Dune, like the dunes of the ocean. Cool. Well, maybe we'll bump into each other again. I've got a friend who runs a science club for 8-14 year-olds, I think. Are you in? No. We hate that club. Oh, yeah? To each his own. Yeah, I'm going to work. Bye. - Come, Pompon. Come. - So, my chicks,... ... how about a chicken for tonight? - Oh yeah! ClauClau, are you doing it without me? Well, no, but you're beautiful. Listen, you'll get all dirty. But no, I don't care. I'm going to catch it. I don't care. - You're so beautiful. - Hey, come on, girls. - Can you help me decide which one to kill? - Sure. Come on, come on, come on! - You agree to this one? - Yes. Okay. Amen. Yeah, yes. And that's it. All done. Okay, give me my bag. - Bye, everyone. - Bye. You're in for a treat tonight. That's quite a young man Margaux caught for us, isn't it? - You see? - What's that? Those are balls. Ah, what's the matter with her? - She's not very well, apparently. - No, I don't think she is. - Did you film it? - Totally. If you show it to anyone, I'll kill myself and you. Okay. - The chicken's not so smart now. - Oh, you're stupid. Dad? Mom? I can't move on. Can you see that? I do everything. I do nothing. It's all the same. I have confidence in you. It's hard for you now, but you have to move on. - Mathilde! - Cuckoo! You're an idiot. You look like a chicken. - So, what were they doing? - Stuff. - Oh no, in bed? - Something like that. My mother said the other day that they're going to explode in mid-air. - When will it be? - Never. - I don't know why she said that. - Come on, let's go to your place. It's too embarrassing knowing he's here. Your father is naked. "You were so unfit to love, that you had to wait 32 years entrusted with a child you didn't even conceive." How could she write this? My ex was jealous of my daughter. - Oh. - No. - Don't worry, I've already read the letter plenty of times. "I loved you from the very first second." "When you cut a flower to put it in a vase, you bring it back to life." "I remember the first Moribana." Mori... okay... what's that? - Moji... Did you say mojito? - Mom! Moribana, Mom! It has nothing to do with that. It's a Japanese bouquet I created with you in mind, using magnolias from my garden. I too, used to love working with the magnolia when I was in the lab. Well, you bet! It smells great! Ah no, magnolia extract, has nothing to do with the scent of the flower. It's a very, very, very violent smell, in fact. Besides, when you introduce it into a perfume, you really have to use minute quantities, because it can ruin everything. Yeah. Magnolia is hell. But hey, it's irresistible. - But it's violent. - Yeah. But you're going to go back to work soon? Well, there you have it. For the ex-florist, end of story. But still, what a bitch, anyway. She left here on August 20 and I received this on the 24th. The 23rd, Mom. We missed the Toro de Fuego because of this. - Yes, that's right. Yes. - Let's go! - Not such a bitch? - Yes, she wanted to leave. Yes, the truth is, yes. - Yes. So, Goodbye, bitch. Still talking about your hysterical florist, my darling? Well, I wanted to tell it because they didn't come last year, so they didn't know Sabine. Bless you, it's not going to be all misfortune. Well, it's happy hour! Mathilde, can you get me something? - It's 11 o'clock. - Please, darling. In "happy hour," there's "happy" before "hour." Mathilde, please! Make me a mojito, like I taught you! She's nine, Mom. Look, I learned to do laundry when I was six. Act II, Scene 3. Pépé returns to the stage. - Super Pépé! - Super Pépé! Super, super, super Pépé! Super Pépé! You believe in marriage? I can't believe it. Really! Really dreamy, eh? Poor Louise. She had it rough with her ex. - Yeah, she did. - She was very lonely. Very García Márquez heroine, I think. You know, I'd rather have you leave me than go through what I'm going through. Why do you always say everything you think? If one can have a little bit of filter. If one can think about things a little bit, one does not say things like that. Please stop with that, now. These women who want to go out with women, but cancel at the last minute. - They're just blowing in the wind. - Yeah. Plus, they make jokes about something called "oral sex." Oh, good grief! You've heard of it? What is it? It's someone who talks about sex all the time. They talk about it... ...uh, even when getting up in the morning. They talk about it all the time. Oh, have mercy! - Aren't you with Dune, honey? - I'm on my way, but I've got a flat tire. - Oh. Come on in. - Yes. - Ah... How did that happen? - Some thorns got caught on the bike. Ah... They were very nasty thorns. - Yes. - Yes. And... Oh no, you're out of luck. I'll see what I can do. Thanks. Is it true that you're going to America soon? Yes, with my motorcycle. With my motorcycle, the "Poderosa II", as it's called. Why do you ask? To know out about my bike. No, no. I won't give up on your bike. I promise. - Thanks. - Bye. I don't know why parents force their children to be happy, when sometimes it's just not possible. I'm going away one of these days. Far away. The parents, I'll see them again when they've... ... they'll get something bad. Cancer. Or like a big, fat Covid. Except Dad. I'll see him two or three times before he dies. Because he loved me a lot more than Mom did. I'm sure she won't even notice I'm gone. Are you serious? Can't you get further away? It's all over me! It's fine. Shake out your bathing suit and it won't be dirty. No, you say that for the camera, but I can't show my breasts to everyone. - No, but it's fine. Stop it. You seriously don't have any. - Yes, little ones. And then my mother has bonnet-B [B-cup]. I'm bound to have small breasts. What's bonnet-B? It's a thing for measuring boobs. Like in the Middle Ages, they used bonnets to put on breasts because they were very poor. They didn't have bras. At least, I think so. The annoying thing about being adopted is you don't know if your real mother had big tits or not. Wouldn't you like to try and find her, just to find out? Yeah, but she's dead. - No, you're joking! You didn't tell me. - Yeah. Actually, ummm... she saved a lot of people in a sinking ship. Not the Titanic, but you know, almost the same. And ummm... At one point, she saw they had ground under their feet, you see, and she had a heart attack. That's cool! In a way, she died naturally. She was really strong. Yeah, yeah. This year's a drag. The sand isn't as soft, I find. Yeah, I'm outta here. Do you want to go to the shack to buy blue skulls, like before? Yeah! Skulls, I love you! Please, there! Can't you speak quietly? - The beach belongs to everyone! - But we are everyone! Oh, it's too hot. You saw the ferns, they're already all burnt. Pépé says it's all going to hell. Yeah, totally. - Titilde, where are you? - Here. Ah, that's just awesome! - No, seriously. You can't do that! It will change the planet! - Exactly, I cooled it. - Why don't you pick something and close the door? - Uh, yes, yes. I'm sorry. She's a friend. She's looking for something and... How's it going? - Sorry. - Do we know each other? - Yeah, we were at Claude's barn before. - Ah yes, that's right. - We'd like some skulls. - Yeah. In fact, I'm hiding them, because there's some little creeps who steal them, I think... The red ones don't sting as much and the blue ones rip your face off. - I recommend the red ones. - We'll take the blue ones. - Okay. One each? - Yeah. - And lollipops, too? - Yeah. - Yo, guys! - Yo! That's it, I've got the beers and vodka covered for tonight at the clearing. Ah, so cool. As always! I finish work at 11 p.m., so I'll join you afterwards. - Okay, that's fine. - Where's the clearing? - We can't tell you that. - It's a secret. Really, it's okay. They're just kids. Who will they tell? No, no, no, brother. Don't let them come. - Do you see the wild beach sign over there? - Stop it! Stop right there. See the wild beach sign? Don't listen to him, he says... There's a forest, turn right, 150 metres and you're there. - Come tonight, if you like. - No, it's all right. I'm kidding, right? I hope so, yeah. Besides, Jules, you know my good buddies will be there. Oh yeah? Will Mélanie be there, or not? - Mélanie will be there, yes. - And you know I'm the only one on the coast who hasn't caught up with her? But how can you talk like that about my friend? She's a princess! You're sick! - A princess? - Well, yeah, a princess. Look what I found. It's Chinese. Can you believe it? I've got a Chinese coin. - See you tonight, bitches! - Yeah, you watch too many movies, virgin! Take a look. The girl's throwing up. Not even in the bathroom. She's just like my mother. It's probably the gluten. Watch. Quick, protect the camera! I was bored without you last year, you know. You say that because we're little. But you'll see, as we grow up, nobody misses us anymore. Frankly, it's great to be able to repair the cabin. When we have kids... Aaahhh! It's a wild boar! - I'm peeing here, Dune. - No, no, no, no, no. On the count of three, we run. We smash the hut and go out the back. Can't we scream? Maybe your father is nearby. No, do as I say. Dad! - Dad! - Dune? - What's happening? - We were attacked. - Huh? May I? - Yes. - Mom! Dune! You're okay? - We've been attacked by a wild boar! - A real boar? - Huge. - I don't get it, your dad never left the house. Very funny. - The sink's cool. - Yeah. - Dry your hair. - But what really happened, then? Are you alright? I'll tell you all about it. Can Mathilde stay the night? - You want to? - Yeah. [Indistinct arguing] But I'm trying to find a solution. One. You know what I mean? A solution where the three of us can live together. You and me. You, me, and our daughter. The three of us. The three of us, Sarah. Do you understand me? It's not just about you,... ... you and your fucking drama, for fuck's sake. It drives me crazy that you're always looking for solutions. Sometimes there isn't one. That's the way it is. I do what I can. - Wake up! Wake up! - What are you doing? Don't you want to go to the slacker party? - What, now? - Well yes. Not tomorrow! - Do you think our parents will mind? - No. Come on, let's go. - Does a wild boar recognize humans? - If we run away, I think so, yeah. What the fuck are you doing here? Go home! You're underage! We were invited. You should know. It was a joke. I was just kidding. She's so cute, the visitor. - Come on, I'll pour you a drink. - No, there's nothing to offer. Oh la la! What a tightwad! Come on, let's go. - Do you have any iced tea? - No. Just shut up! Don't argue. Come on, iced tea! Oh, kitten, you're here! How are you? How are you, my kitten? Come, dance with me. Come on, dance a little. Dance with me. Dance a little, here! Get moving! Move! Dance with yourself! Who cares? And you know what? We don't care, even if they're watching us. Screw them! - Hello! How are you, Margaux? - Damn! - What's the matter, you hungry? - Stay out of this, please. Mathilde! - What's up? - Mathilde! I saw you dancing. It's so nice here. I love it. - I didn't dance, no way. - What are you doing? It's a shame the pizzas are cold, though. Hot or cold. It's all the same. - Where's Margaux? - Peeing over there, I think. I made you a plate. What do you want from me? Get out, please. You don't belong here. You're not my daughter. Go away! But then, when you told me about your first mother, I didn't understand. In fact, she was a firefighter. She saved a burning building. Not the Montparnasse Tower, but almost the same. And then some! - Stop. Come. What's the matter with you? I've had it. You're pissing me off. I'm not going to your house. But you can see they're bums. They were laughing at you. - Really? When? - The whole time! I was laughing with them. Besides, I'm going to see my mother. I have more fun with her than with you. I never want to see you again! Just because you have a lot of problems with your mother doesn't mean I do with mine! - I've got zero problems, bitch! - You can't tell, you big whore! - Where is Dad? - He needed a change of scenery. But you don't change scenery when you've just arrived! What did you do to him? That Dune, is our story, not yours. I'm fed up. It's not working. He's got to go. It's me, not him! What the hell are you talking about? Since you didn't even notice I was out. You're not even a mother! Yes, I noticed! And why were you out? And since when do you go out at night? Yell at me better than that. It sounds like you don't care. I hate you for it. I don't even like you anymore. I'll yell at you better. I'm yelling at you really loud. Monday, August 2, 2021. I haven't heard from Mathilde. She takes everything badly. Dad didn't come home. I know he's in his cabin. So I can't leave forever yet. I have to keep an eye on my mother. Normally, mothers don't keep tabs on themselves. Woodlice are crustaceans, not insects. Dad told me that once. It's bad luck not to be a shrimp when you're a crustacean. And to be forced to be a woodlouse instead. Living under a rock, that's really the worst. - Dune! - What? Mathilde just called, she's waiting for you at the mini-golf course! I don't feel like it. I want to swim! Don't you want to go swimming for once? There's no point in being here if you don't swim, frankly. I made a pie, if you're hungry. I'm like Dad; I don't eat between meals. Hi. You're not sulking anymore? Do you know how long a sperma... thingy lasts? When it's inside. Well-inside. A spermatozoid? No, I don't know. I've never seen one. Why? I bought some tofu for my mother at the shack and he was talking about it. From lifespan to the end of a pipe and everything. I don't get it. It's sex. Even Elliot talked about sex. Yeah. They're so obsessed. I'm telling you. - We're only doing hole number two, aren't we? - If you like. Say yes or no, not "if you like." One day, if someone tries to take you away from France in a van, you have to make yourself clear. Yes or no, not "if you like." And one day, you'll be kidnapped and your mother will be forced to sell your house to free you. - Wow! - Oh, darn! - I'll never make it, my love. I'll never make it. - Yeah, if you don't, I've had enough. Yeah, this one's super hard. Especially if you're beginners. What would you do to us? Go... go play in the street there. Go away, we're on vacation, aren't we? But everyone's on vacation, so it's okay! Come on, Dune. Come on, let's go. - Yeah, besides, we don't like beginners. - Especially you. Two little bitches! Hi. So, we'll take "Piranha." - Piranha is a horror movie, right? - Yes, yes, it's good. - There. - Thanks. And we'll have some chilli potato chips too. Elliot, you big asshole! Can you answer when we call you? Seriously, I've left you 46 messages! What the hell are you doing? - Stop shouting, can't you see I've got work to do. Let's go in here. - But I don't care! I don't give a fuck! - Margaux's at rock-bottom right now! - She's been crying since this morning! - I've got nothing to say to her! Take responsibility! You call her! You do something! It's your kid! Shit! - She's having an abortion because of you, actually! - What do you want me to tell her? - She sleeps with 15 guys at a time... - That's bullshit, Elliot. - Girls, if you want to grab some stuff, we'll work it out later. - Okay. - Grow up! - We're all grown ups. I'm against you coming here. She's pregnant. I knew it. - She's not for adoption. - Are you serious? She made Elliot say he was the father. When it's not even him. Of course it's him. We saw them. He even touched her tits. Yes, but she's in a relationship with everyone. You can tell. - When will the baby be born? - It mustn't be born here! It mustn't! - What did I do to you? Are you crazy? - You say such stupid things! - Come on, where are you going? - To Marcel's pigeon coop. Stop, we're not allowed to! - I want her to have this baby! - And I even want her to give it to my mother and me if she doesn't want it! Oh yeah, you think that's how it goes with babies? I thought you were already enough for your mother! Bitch! Stop! - Stop! - Owwww! I hate you! I'm sorry. You won't tell anyone about the argument? The baby is none of our business. That's their rotten story! They're bums, I tell you. I don't feel like watching a movie today. I don't really like movies anymore. They're always the same in France. Yeah, that's true. I don't really like skulls anymore. Yeah, but they're really good, though. Maybe we should try the red ones. I said to myself, a cake is out of season. So, rice pudding scented with Buddha's hand for my Sarah's birthday. Well, that's nice, but it's the day after tomorrow. Well, yes, but for superstition's sake, I'd rather give it to you first. Yeah, no, actually, I screwed up again. Here, smell this. If I recall, it's something like cedar, isn't it? That's right, cedar. And the orange, without bitterness. Very, very sweet. Yes, that's right, without bitterness. Well, you see. So, your guy didn't come home? No. You know what? You have to manage on your own. You won't have any more children because you can't. You're old, you're dented, you're out of date. Change your story. - You're tough! - No, but... ... the story with the little one who won't come is yours, isn't it? Not anyone else's. Well, we're going to eat this rice pudding because I'm giving a class in an hour. - I'm not very hungry right now, you know. - Shut up, honey. You're going to eat. To smell nothing when you're normally paid for it, you know what it's a sign of? No. That you want to be more sapiens than homo sapiens. What's that supposed to mean? Well, you see... ... bipedal homo sapiens has moved a long way from the animal kingdom. And he rejects anything that allows him to smell the soil. Your unconscious forces you into a civilizing process. I understand what you're saying. You need to become homo habilis again. Find your animality. Get down on all fours. Nonsense. Come on, let's go. Sniff the ground. - I don't smell anything. - Ah yes, don't be impatient. It'll come. Look. Feel what nature gives you. Concentrate. Feel it. The earth speaks to you. Ah, but there are critters. But are you sure you've only lost your sense of smell? Come on, let's go back. Think like a cat. Arch like a cat. There you go. We're doing yoga! Afterwards, they'll go for a mud bath. Like pigs. Forget it. Friday, August 6, 2021 You can't do that. There aren't even any stars tonight. Why don't you say when you'll be back? I wouldn't have children. It's simpler. You can see what it's like with kids. It's a mess. On the other hand, if I love someone, it'll be forever. Not like Margaux. I ordered pizzas from the shack. They deliver. I got you a ham and mushrooom. Never mind. - Did you get Dad? - I'm leaving him alone. I'd like to talk to you about something. We're talking now. Mom? Will you get that? Here. Leaving tomorrow? Do I owe you Piranha too? No, don't worry. You can keep it. - Have you seen it? - No, not yet. - I heard everything at the shack. - Heard what? - About the baby in the girl's belly... - You're too young for that, and then... I don't know. Chicks say whatever and... Besides, I know you didn't do it. Yeah, it's shit. Here, you want to wipe yourself? You're all wet. You talk to me like a baby. You know I'm not your age, right? I'm 10 years older than you. Well, go on. I'll leave you to it. Your pizzas will be cold. - Kisses. - Kisses. Er... You're Buzette's son, aren't you? The pedal boat king? No, that's Simon. I'm the son of a jerk who didn't raise me. Ah... Why? It's my mother. She thought it was you. But then, she's always wrong. - Bye. - Goodbye. "Eliot is innocent." - What are you doing here? - I'm... looking for Pompon. Ah... Well, Pompon isn't here. I think he's glued to the old lady's Labrador over there. - You have to be in love. - Ah okay, I didn't know. But in any case, Pompon can't have children. Claude finally cut it off. He... cut the stuff. Ah, okay. - Well, bye. - Bye. Dune, we're here! What have you been up to? Let's play this great game with Pépé! - Oh, I was bored. - Dune, go ahead, five boys' names. Uh, five? I don't know, but I don't really feel like playing. Paul, Kilian,... ... Adil, Milo. It's the guys from the campsite two years ago. Just say Elliot, the guy from the shack. - No, you're crazy! I don't even know him! - But yes, like that! It makes a game! It's fun! Now give us five possible homes on Earth. Er,... house, caravan,... ... shell, tent, ... castle,... ... ummm... - All right, that's five. Wow! All right, then. You'll have four children with Elliot from the shack. You'll live in a tent. He'll never have a job, that's for sure. You'll be very poor and vegan. You got the green sticker [enviro-approved vehicle sticker]. - I don't care. - Yes, yes, it's your future. - I love it. I love this game. - I discovered Kylian Mbappé, didn't I? And he'll know why we live in prison. Whatever. This game doesn't really tell the future. Well, there's a bit of a fresh breeze now. Time for my Brazilian coffee. I hope there's some cognac left. - Shall we go? - Yeah. Oh, I just got here. Do you mind taking my things? I'd like to swim and walk around the pond on my own. Over there? But it's disgusting. Looks like you never want to play again. It's boring. - You be careful, Dune. - Oh, yeah. What are you doing there? Aren't you disgusted by the slime? No. What are you doing? Well, I'm going to my hut there. - My father also builds cabins. - Yeah, I didn't build it, though. It's that one over there, with the little overhang. I don't know if you can see it. In truth, you shouldn't walk here. There have been hooks and nets ever since the storms. You should go to the lake or the dock over there. It's safer. - Yeah. - If you want, I'll take you. - See the colors in the water there? - Yeah, it's beautiful. - It's pollution. - All the same, the pollution is beautiful. Yeah. What about the baby? What are you going to do about the baby? - I can't talk about that with you. - You have to decide. I don't want to talk about it. We don't know each other and you're not old enough. I think you'd go far with someone who has a lot of confidence in you. That doesn't mean anything. Besides, that's not life. You don't run away at the first sign of trouble, and... ... I've been through tougher stuff. Even if I'm a dickhead, I can drag myself through the mud. I'm not running away. Aren't you a little small to be talking about this? - Can you stop the boat? - Why? - What are you doing? - Bye. What did I do to you? Bye, huh. This movie's scary, admit it. You've got something there. Yuck! It's slime! You're disgusting. - Where are you going? - Well, I'm going to clean myself up, since I'm so gross. Dune! Dune, come back! - Something's up! - What's happened? Take a look for yourself. Oh no, my God! - Why are you filming? - It makes me feel better. You're sick! Never do that! Dune! Dune! Good evening, Thiago. I'm glad to see you. I didn't know if you were already in America or not. Yeah, almost. I'm going to pause here, right? Dune! She's sulking. And for you, all is well? Yeah, except we have a great friend who's pregnant. What? How old is she? - She's old. You don't know her. - Ah. Sorry, sweetie. I didn't mean to scare you. I'm sorry I run off. "... ran off." - ... I ran off, yes. I wouldn't have left if I had told you first. Listen. I'm here now. - Where were you? - Not far away. - Did you go fishing? - Yeah. Sharks. Lots of sharks. - And piranhas. - You two are awful. Between mom smelling the soil and you making stupid jokes, you're just kids. It's pitiful. What about me? Can't you ask me how I'm doing? - No, but... You're always fine. - Not so much. No, you are my little champion girl, sweetheart. It's all right now. We're going to have a great vacation. Okay? Wonderful! My beautiful little girl, I love you very much and miss you a lot. Oh, I miss you so much when I'm not with you. Very, very, very much. Hey! It's cool that your father didn't go to America. It's amazing. You really look like you're dead. There's a woman who makes pottery with my mother. And her daughter took some drug thing. As a result, she wanted to jump into a swimming pool to drown herself. Except she hadn't noticed that there was no water in the pool. As a result, she died anyway. The brother of the girl next to me in English, he died very young. Something to do with genetics. Something you can't see when you look at him. There are too many deaths in life, I think. - Yeah, it's overkill. - Especially in horror movies. Seriously. Shall we rinse off? Pass the towel, please. - Here. - Thanks. Look. Do you think I'm blonde? At the same time, if the baby of the girl from the shack is dead, it might be best for everyone. Poor thing, though. When you're little, I don't think you know you're dead. - You just think you're asleep. - I didn't know that. Can you look at my highlights, please. Seriously, there's more to life than hair dye. And no, you're not blonde. When I went to get the bread, I saw Margaux. She didn't even acknowledge me. - Didn't she see you? - Oh yes, totally. You can't know if she saw you. You always exaggerate, everything. Actually, yes, she did notice me. She said, "Aren't you with your clingy friend?" I said, "Who's my clingy friend?" She told me, "That other tease." I'm not sure, but I think she was talking about you. He isn't here? Come. - Good? - Blah! Oh la la! You girls are hot! - It's forbidden to say that to girls our age. - Leave it, they're crazy. - Here. - Thanks. - Hi. - You're alone? Elliot and Margaux let me down. Yeah. Margaux's got health problems. I don't know. We could ask them if they had the baby... Ah! - He isn't here? - No. Why doesn't he want to talk to me, anyway? What's his problem? He blocked my number? How old is he? Seriously? I didn't know that, but... You accuse him of something, but he doesn't know what you're doing either. - You're always running away, coming back, crying... - But what do I have to do to make him believe me? He's scared, that's all. A little baby is no small thing. What do you know about it? Shouldn't you be in bed at this hour? - Oh no, it's her mother's birthday... - I don't give a fuck. I don't give a fuck. And if not, I have the address of an orphanage which is good. We're going to take "Paranormal Activity," as well as the whipped cream. It would be cool if Pépé adopted the baby. A lot better than the orphanage, though. Nacre, mother of pearl, and it's rainbow colors. Plus, Mathilde would be a great big sister. That's for sure. - Cuckoo! - Hi! - Sandrine! - How's it going? - Auntie Louise! - Park on the terrace if you want! - Too long. - Where is my champion? Oh, he jumped from the car. He's coming on his latest bike. - How are you? Doing well? - Yeah. Sweetheart, so good to see you! That's the stuff! It's sandier on your driveway! - You're well, Thiago? - Champion-issimo! Anybody comes near this bike and I'll burn them to a crisp. - How's the troubled family? - We're fine. Nice bike. - How are you? Hey! Cuckoo! What's up, young man? Hey! What did I just say? - What are you doing? - A little bit! - A little bit! My Captain-issimo! Champion! - No, no, no! Come on, that's enough! She'll be staying a long time? - Well, wasn't that the plan? - You've got to be kidding me. - How nice! - You are well? - I'm happy, yes. It's been a long time! Oh, holy mother! Who had the nerve to put the Cachaça in the fridge? - Sarita. Sarita. - No, no, but it's a crime! It's not me, it's Mathilde! - Oh, there's a real handsome gentleman! - Oh, Claude! Ah, yes, I... er... ... it was me who invited him. Well, that's a very good idea, Dunita! It's been a very long time since you called me that. - Claude! - How are you, Claude? I'm fine. - And so, my chicks, you're okay? - Yeah. Ah, well, that's good. You're in great shape, I see. - I see, freshening up. - Hi. Ah, thank you. That's kind. - Did you run into him again years later? - He had gone to Tahiti instead. - No. Well, no. It's very weird, isn't it? - What nonsense. ♪ Tired... ♪ ♪ ... of crying. ♪ ♪ And the dawn won't come. ♪ ♪ I no longer know... ♪ ♪ ... if I should curse you or forget you. ♪ ♪ I'm so afraid... ♪ ♪ ... of searching for you... ♪ ♪ ... and finding you... ♪ ♪ ... where my friends... ♪ ♪ ... assure me you go. ♪ - Olé! - Olé! ♪ I would rather... ♪ ♪ ... give up. ♪ ♪ And finally pull out the nails of my grief. ♪ ♪ But my eyes die without looking into your eyes. ♪ ♪ And my love with the dawn, awaits you again. ♪ ♪ On your own accord you took to partying. ♪ ♪ Black dove, black dove, where, where will you be? ♪ ♪ Don't play with my honor anymore... ♪ Stop filming, Dune. There's nothing to see. - Stop! - I need memories. That's what I like in life. Remembering things. In case one day I leave forever. Go ahead, go back with them. I'm coming. I have a friend who always says, "Don't run away at the first sign of trouble." I think he is very right. Yes. I might get buried there. Under the pine needles. Calm. I love this place. Good grief! Everyone is obsessed with death! You're not going to die soon. I can tell. I can't wait for it sometimes. You know, death isn't so bad. - That's the first time I've heard someone say that. - Is it? - Do you know what Mathilde's real mother died of? - She's not dead, she's alive. What? Mathilde buries her. She prefers it because... ... she's afraid her mother will be jealous. That Louise will be jealous. But you know, Mathilde goes to too much trouble, because the real mother is the one who raised you. Not necessarily the one that bore you. Yes, but when your baby is in your belly, you've got to love it, that's for sure. - Yes. But you can carry your child and give it to someone who can't have one. That's very sad. And not because you don't love it. It's horrible, though. Isn't it? You've got to give women a break. Huh? Have you ever thought that you don't love your mother anymore? Oh yes, of course. Unfortunately. It's important. But I love my mother, and you too. Come here. I'm thirsty. - It's here! - Where? - What? - This is where they make love all the time. Come. - This is where they make love all the time, you can tell. - Yeah, this is it. Who? Who are you talking about? Oh, young people with no future. - Losers. - Yeah, but they're still friends. You see, Dune? Elliot, he touched her boobs here. He gave her his spermato... Spermatozoids. And it's not Elliot, of course. It's ground upon which to remake the world, here. Eh? On the other hand, your friends are polluting. The bottles are... not empty. Eh, that help me. We'll take them. Let's go! In my Nahuatl classes, I learned an Aztec poem composed to increase soil fertility. I say it to myself every morning. You're very fertile, I can tell. - Think so? - Like crazy. Ah, what an asshole wind! Try to be careful! Keep your spirits up, Sandrine, eh? Otherwise you won't hold your pose. - Shit! What's with this fucking place? - Axel, apologize! Okay, that's it, we're all going swimming. - Come on, Sarah. Let's go for a swim. - No, I... - Let's go! Come! - No, no, no, no, thanks. - No, go on, have fun! Look! - You go ahead! - Come on! Enjoy! - No, thanks. I don't feel like it. - How's it going? What are you making? - A hole. - Come on, it's good! - Stop it! Stop it! - Come and have a swim! Come on! - Stop it! I'm telling you I don't want to go! - What's wrong with you, you sick bastard? - Can you believe it? You hit me! I'm sorry, but it's okay... How can you spend more than 24 hours with a neurotic that annoys everyone? - Stop, Axel! You're embarrassing me! Fuck! - But your sister's a pain! She's so fucked up! - And she pisses off the whole world! - Here, leave this boy to me. And she has time now that she doesn't work! I'm outta here! - What happened to you, you fucking cunt? - Thiago! Fucking bullshit! What are you doing now, huh? - What are you doing? - Fucking asshole! - Come on! - To hell with it! - Come on! - Say what now? No! Holy shit! Stop! Too strong, your father. Yeah. Thiago, stop! - Stop! - Sarah! Sarah! Stop! I'm like Pépé, actually. I only like the lake because of what's in the ocean. We call it the "gouf." It's over there, behind me. It's an underwater canyon which is four kilometers deep. Pépé knows. She was a geologist. But everyone here knows that. She says the gouf swallows up all people's dreams and we don't know it. And you feel yourself being sucked down. I don't know if it's true. Mom changed, two years ago when she came out of the ocean. I just remembered. And it was a Thursday. Hey, what a beating you gave Axel. Whoa! Wow! I've never seen you hit someone like that. I won't contradict you again, Mamacita. - Never again, champion. - You idiot. Stop. Stop, I have to cut. Stop moving, because I must bring the edges together. Okay, fine, but with me here. Like that. Like that. Like that. There it is! I think we need to separate. - What? - After the summer. No, I can't do that. - I have other plans. - Thiago, stop it, please. - No, you stop. - It's not interesting. Really, seriously. It's not interesting. I've decided. I want us to be at peace. - We'll get it, we'll get it, we'll get it! Yes! - Yes. - Yeah... yeah... yeah... - No, I can't believe it! Nice one, Dune! We'll just say we're his parents and we're divorced. We'll each keep him for a week, and mail him to each other. Want to? - Keep it forever. - You mean it? Don't you think I can see how sad you look there? Like, you pretend all the time that it's okay, but it's like there's a ghost between us. What's this ghost doing here? We can't live like this. I didn't want to disturb you, I wanted to bring you the end of your belt. I rummaged around. How do you know it's mine? I just saw it, that's all. - Thanks. Where did you find it? - In the forest. - Did you come here just for that? - Yes. No. Don't you want to come in? I've got something to wipe you down with. No, it's fine. I like the rain. Oh yes, and then... uh... - Piranha, wasn't even scared. - Oh, yeah? Yeah, a lot of times, you can tell it's rigged and stuff. In fact, it's cool when it's rigged but still works. Yeah, but that's not all. I also find they take unnecessary risks. And why is it that girls are always the ones in horror films? They're always the ones who come on strong. You have to get yourself into trouble, it seems. Anyway, thank you, it's nice of you to... ... to take care of me like this. I wasn't cool with you, so... ... I don't know if I deserve it. Oh yeah, shit. You got a little gnat in your eye. You just go in, I'll take it out. Put your head up. Don't move. - Are you okay? - Yeah, but... I also wanted to say goodbye, because I'm leaving tonight. I won't tell anyone but you. Wait, don't move. I've almost got it. And then, Margaux's either cheating on you or she's been raped. She doesn't dare tell you. But it's not your baby. Wait, what are you talking about? Say it again. You should talk to her. I think you'd better go. Okay, goodbye. It's stylish in here. Well, cool. Over there, over there! - Oh, jeez! Isn't that the girl? - What the hell would she be doing here? Well, I don't know, but it's Margaux, I tell you. In any case, she looks upset. Maybe, but her moustache is cool, anyway. Can't you see we need some space here?! What the hell are you doing?! Stilts are really dangerous for babies. But look, she doesn't care. You see why the baby shouldn't be born? And let us pose! I don't fucking believe it! He's gonna fall apart! Go on, beat it! Go away! Olé! Toro! Toro! Toro! Toro! Come, little bull! Bravo! Toro! Toro! Toro! Toro! Toro! Toro! Toro! Bravo! Summer of 2021. Dad! Dad! Dad! It's so wrong to avoid responsibility like that. If you want to leave, just say so. - But aren't you supposed to be sleeping? - Same as you. Would you like me to show you around? This is the entry, which was a bit artistic, eh? And that's new too. - What's that? - The light. Ah. Hey, here you go. My lure board. To awaken the souls. But be very careful because... ... it's dangerous. Pointed, like this. Ah! Oh, damn it! It's alright. It's okay. It doesn't hurt. Okay, forget that. So, shall we go for a swim? No, forget it. Let's go home, Dad. - Go home? - Yeah. - You want to keep that with you? - Yes, yes, yes. I have time. How's it going, girls? - I'm dying for a barbecue. - It's now forbidden on the beach. That law is stupid. Hello! I have a stomach ache! Would you like to make me a mojito? Well, not if you have a stomach ache. Hey, that's just it... I'm hungry. Are there actually tomatoes? - Would you like some cherry tomato halves? - Yes. I'll get them. - Shit! - What's the matter? - The speaker. I forgot it. - What? What did you say, my love? If you feel good, that's good. You'll have a belly full of tomato halves. Oh, no! - I'll get it. - I'll be fine, thank you. It's a good thing she thinks to eat something before pouring herself that mojito, isn't it? No, it's not that she's thinking about eating something, it's that she's eating something so she can slurp down that mojito without me saying anything. - Well, that's what I'm telling you. She's well organized. - Yeah, yeah. Hey! Someone's there! It's the gouf! It's the gouf, there! That mojito a day, she's not going to stop now, is she? We're in a performance society. - Is someone there? You see? - Where? There, you see? Where's your father? He's gone to get the speaker. Why? Call him, because there's someone there. - They're stuck! They can't move! - Mom! - ...well, yes. - Mom! Hey! Hey! Come on! It's there, you see, in the gouf! Look, the gouf! Look! - They're not moving! - What? They're not moving! They're stuck in the gouf! Come Mathilde, come! It's over there! Who can see? - It's the end of the road! This is the end! - To the water! Over there! - Mom! - Careful! Cross the current! Cross it! Don't just stop there! Keep going! Your wife is in the water! She's in the water! Go! Go, quickly! What's up? Everything okay? She mustn't fall asleep. Oh my goodness! Poor thing! Spit it out. Spit it all out. It's Margaux. - Nothing at all! - Yes. - Yes. - Yes. Mom? - She's pregnant. - Huh? She's pregnant. She's pregnant, Mom. Mom is pregnant. Mom was pregnant. I can't eat bananas! It sucks to eat bananas for dinner! Time for watermelons? Too much smiling! Too much smiling! Like this, yeah? No, no, we're here. We're here. Don't worry. - Put the camera down and come! - Come on! - Dune, come! - No! - Dune, come! - No! Thiago! Thiago! What's happening? No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no! Oh, no! 11:47 pm. One day, I almost became a big sister. And then it all ended in the ocean. We didn't mention it, as if it were none of my business. I must have realized it, surely. Actually, I don't know anymore. But I had seen. I should have been the one to teach that baby everything. Cutting meat and not talking back to adults. Also not to say "shit" all the time. Why wasn't I told he'd gone? - You look cold. - Yeah. Do you know if I'll have a brother or sister? Oh, no. Why? You don't want one? But I can't. I couldn't, after you. I've already explained. I don't remember. I don't like babies. You never really know where they come from. You never really know why they leave, either. Oh, just look how lucky we are all here together. How wonderful! What a good vibe, isn't it? Is anyone there? Is anyone there? I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. Whoa, what are you doing here? - Where did you find this? - I'm stuck. I'm gonna die. Damn! Ah well, you got tangled up in all the cables and stuff. What the fuck? How did you do that? Wait, don't move, I'm coming. Quickly. Wait, how did you do that? Don't move or I'll hurt you. How's it going? Are you sure you're okay? I'll cut your throat. Wait, one last one. There, that's it. - Are you okay? - Yes. - Do you want come inside for a drink? - Sure. You're a bit of a stuntwoman, really. - Uh, sorry. - Take a seat, please. - It was your mother who saved Margaux. - Yeah, I know. I didn't do too well with her. I told her that... the situation had left me paralyzed. And that I blamed myself. Anyway, the whole thing was a bit disturbing. - I'm a bit of a shit. - Don't exaggerate. We know we won't be together forever, but we'll see what we can do. But normally when you love someone it's forever. Well, that's what I thought, but it's not really the case. - But didn't you notice anything? - No, what? I'm not gone forever like I told you. Ah, I don't remember. You told me so many things. No problem. You know I don't even know your first name? - Dune. - Like dunes? The same. - Oh yeah, that's pretty. - Thanks. - Well, I'm off. - Don't you want one last horror movie? Uh, no more horror movies. And then, you know, we'll leave. - Oh yeah, you're leaving? - Yeah. - So we won't be seeing each other anymore. - Yeah. If you could not talk about the bull this morning and all... Not even with my friend Mathilde. Yeah, if you want, it's our little secret. Yeah. Thanks. Bye. - Get home safe. - Thanks. - You didn't have time to teach me about acne. - About what? - You know. Of breathing. - Apnoea Acne is when you have breasts and you have lots of problems. Really? I won't run behind your car this year. I don't like it anymore. I didn't want to be there anymore either. I didn't know how to tell you. Here, this is for you. No way! Too cool! Pépé's Rose of Jericho. We hid it under the seat. Where did you find it? - You're going to kill me. - Go ahead anyway. Well, I found it under the seat. And where was the seat? - In Marcel's pigeon hunting cabin. - I hope you're joking. You didn't go up there by yourself? - Definitely. One morning ago. - You're such a maniac. And stop saying your first mother died. You can't do that. How do you know? I've known it all along, that's all. Okay, but come on. Farewell! But please call me when you arrive so I don't worry. Yes, Grandma. That's not my sister. What the hell is she doing here? We're leaving. Yeah, she's not coming for you. No. A few days. Well, I'll be damned. She told me you don't sleep. Congrats. On the other hand, she had to have her car repaired. She was a pain in the ass. Did you hear what you just said? Oh, the diesel. I've missed it. Well, go on. Go on. My mother used to tell me that she dreamt of me even before I was born. That must be what Pépé is talking about. That's how to invent a story about a baby that's coming, if you really want it. Pépé once told me that, apart from the Rose of Jericho, only she could live for two years without drinking a drop of water. Pépé always speaks the truth. It's 2:23 pm on August 27. See you soon Mathilde. See you next year! - Yeah, it's not modern. - No, but new and different. We can't. We're going to put in something modern in stainless steel. Right, Dune? We'll do it all over again. What are you saying? - Can we do my room? - Yeah. I was thinking of buying a... a lion. It's like a cat. It's like a cat. - A baby lion. - A little one. Yes. That's one baby lion. - For Dune? - For Dune! Yes, he can stay in her room. ♪ Magnolias For Ever by Claude François ♪ ♪ Your girl is crying in the night ♪ ♪ Is she wrong or is she right ♪ ♪ There's nothing I can do about it ♪ ♪ Your girl is shining in the night ♪ ♪ Burning burning burning bright ♪ ♪ I don't know what to do anymore ♪ ♪ Tell her I'm just like her ♪ ♪ That I still love the songs ♪ ♪ About love and swallows ♪ ♪ Of sorrow, wind and shivers ♪ ♪ Tell her I'm thinking of her ♪ ♪ When people talk to me of magnolias ♪ ♪ When I hear that new music ♪ ♪ Resonating like the sounds of battle ♪ THAT SUMMER For Nadine... ♪ No, I don't know what to do anymore ♪ ♪ She's so strong she breaks ♪ ♪ She was proud, now she's submissive ♪ ♪ Like a love that lets go ♪ ♪ That breaks and doesn't bend ♪ ♪ You look just like her ♪ ♪ When she trembles ♪ ♪ And in your voice ♪ ♪ I sometimes hear ♪ ♪ A bit of her voice ♪ ♪ And she looks just like you ♪ ♪ When she trembles ♪ ♪ When she cries ♪ ♪ There in the heart ♪ ♪ Trees in bloom ♪ ♪ Tell her I'm afraid for her ♪ ♪ In basements when it's dark ♪ ♪ When I hear this new music ♪ ♪ Where despair cries out ♪ ♪ Tell her I'm thinking of her ♪ ♪ In a large field of magnolias ♪ ♪ And if all flowers are beautiful ♪ ♪ I often burn my fingers ♪ ♪ Magnolias by the hundreds ♪ ♪ Magnolias as in the past ♪ ♪ I don't know what to do anymore ♪ ♪ The magnolias are still there ♪ ♪ She looks like all the girls ♪ ♪ When they love like that ♪ ♪ Whether they're mean or shy ♪ ♪ Poor violets or magnolias ♪ ♪ She loves big, wet skies ♪ ♪ And deserts where it's cold ♪ ♪ Sometimes she cries when I arrive ♪ ♪ And she laughs as she goes ♪ ♪ If you go off into the storm ♪ ♪ If you go, you'll see her ♪ ♪ Tell her I'm just like her ♪ ♪ That I still love the songs ♪ ♪ About love and swallows ♪ ♪ Of sorrow, wind and shivers ♪
