You might not agree with what I say...but.. .. you asked for my opinions and if you shake you head, then I'm sorry.. I'm not any sort of chauvinist pig or whatever... Let's go on... There's still a belief that men are sex maniacs.. ..and supremely confident Men are not more sex maniacs than are females... We desire...we need.. But the woman also desires..and needs... And the desire .. ..must be equal to the man's in similar physical nature. Men have been maniacs... ..because they were permitted to be so. Rape by a man is common... Rape by a woman, not so So a man has his way with a woman in his dark mania Yes..deep down, so.. I have no patience with these men Actually... I saved a very attractive girl from being raped, only last week.. She walked toward me on a lonely road And I restrained myself Ahhh.....the first thing ..that comes to mind is.. ..is a woman on the street soliciting men? My experience... in paying for sex ..is a great deal broader than that. ..ahh.. I told my wife.. Initially she was disgusted.. because of the stereotype I mentioned.. Then we got to know each other better..... and.. We realised we weren't going to satisfy each other We broadened our sexual horizons, in lots of ways Separately, and together [ recorder clicks off ] [ recorder clicks ] [ recorder FF/RW ] [ recorder stops/clicks ] I tried to work out...

I am male .. . but I am also a loving, tender, caring person I concern myself .. with not only our own, .. but other people's problems as well I have supplied over the years more than my fair share of affection .. .. and..money to run outside and buy what she wants What is it thats so bloody important that a man will walk all the brothels for it I'll tell you a small article that can be bought, hired, looked at in books, or watched on video if you're lucky enough to have one It's called a female body My opinions, do not work in reverse A woman cant find a home that is paid for or being paid for Others get sorted out.. Holidays...gardening.. Children..and all the nice things. Without men .. Neither can these things women hold important, be found in books, videos, Neither can they be hired They have to give something in order to achieve these things.. Not many of them to say the least are prepared to make the sacrifice That is assuming of course, that we are discussing the marrying sort. I fully realise that women alone can do all these things But that is their choice and good luck to them What men need, or rather or should have by law .. is a peaceful life. without ridicule or threat.

Developing an all-round personality? Switchboard yes, hold on a moment Switchboard This one's on about his raw materials expect its the exchange rate Lee says its the dockers [male voice-over] What it amounts to.. in many countries of the world.. .. they put women in a category.. that men want to put them in, don't they? I don't mean a prostitute, however I'm talking about ordinary women I mean... they pigeonhole them A man's got the idea right from childhood as to what a woman's role is .. and he expects her to keep it doesn't he? In other words, a woman can't really be her self Do you understand what I mean? Sociology on the family brings a woman to look after the children ..to be a Good Wife.. a Good Housekeeper.. .. and everything as far as sex is concerned.. .. that you can only have it amongst marriage ..and..anything else ..their not a decent women if they've got other ideas. So a woman, really has to live a Lie.. That's how I look at it. She's got to live to what a man's standard and expectation is She's working as a toilet attendant And the women were getting 5 quid a week less than the men So they took it to court to try and get Equal Pay The judge 'there was no basis for parity to be granted in this case A man approaches the job from a labouring point of view.. Whilst a woman approaches a job from a housekeeping point of view So for the women it wasn't "work" Three weeks later, they reclassified the job The men were still toilet attendants and cleaners.. The women were just attendants.. [interviewer] Does that mean they don't clean anymore? No. Coz if you approach it from a housekeeping point of view.. A cleaner gets taken for granted..

But If it is I don't think men get that much out of it I mean.. My dad worked like a carthorse all his life.. He was doing it for us- for the family. But in lots of ways.. He was robbed of his family Like being 'man of the house' means that.. ..if you've got some to spare.. You're really special But when you're tired... and worn out.. You're ... an ogre.. Either way, you're bit of an "outsider" Yes.... .. I know what you mean My father was always a distant figure He approved... or disapproved..

What are you doing here, anyway? Same as you Don't intend to stay It's funny, isn't it These places are like "halfway houses" for people Nah.. some people live here, coz they've always lived here And when single people like us get moved in They know they've been abandoned. Were you married before then? Yes, I was .. Didn't work out though.. Some people find it hard to leave Yes.. I know That's because we're taught we can't manage without them But a lot of women can't ! You know when they've got kids, and things.. What is it you do, anyway? I earn money, listening to men all day .. and some nights..

[man] It all boils down to the fact.. . that women have their side in Nature.. and..men have got the Others I mean in everyday life a woman is supposed to be the tender, loving partner to look after the man Nobody is 100% male or female A man when he's born a woman bears him A woman, from the time that he is born looks after him Right through to him becoming a man A woman is a powerful influence, isn't she?

They advertised lotteries for council flats in the local paper You have to look out for 'em And you have to queue ALL night And I work most nights. The way I come to terms with it most.. Is through a woman I met through an agency.. It sounds like a cliche that she said she thought I was different from other men Anyway, I suppose its true Because most of the others won't see what's happening She comes ot me with all sorts of problems She's a single mother.. trying to bring up her child [male voice-over] Were I to go with a prostitute Then... I might well feel disgust with myself Not with her.. To my mind, there's nothing disgusting in sex between a male and female. It's still .. well... it's bloody football. Way back in '74 I was an addict with a 23-year old girl Spent some weeks with her Actually it's thanks to her that I'm as open-minded about sex as I am today Must admit that taught me a hell of a lot about giving But... the point here is that .. Eventually I spose I must have experienced a wee bit of what you'd call... .. disgust... I think she wished.. Well..... Might as well have been with an animal But... Don't forget that... As children we're brought up to believe that in all walks of life... The male is the dominant species We watch... at least some of us did.. animals in the street.. The MALE is ALWAYS the dominant one HE takes the initiative He is uppermost in all aspects And now we live in a time when the female takes the initiative It's ... difficult to accept at first .. at least it was for myself.. Deep...... deep down.. A man still believes.. that the hunt is as important as the final kill He must be the Huntsman Not the quarry Now, to my mind If a female makes it obvious that she wants him Then..OK. He may in relax in the satisfaction that while there was no "hunt" There must have been some form of 'Trap' Either way... He wins.

As long as you don't ask me to babysit in the morning [ ♫ instrumental classical ♫] Excuse me Madam, are you a resident? - No, just visiting a friend - I've seen you here before, haven't I? - You might have done I'm sorry madam but non-residents are not allowed above the ground floor - He is expecting me If you give me his room number, I'll call him on the house phone Would you like to come with me? - *sigh* - Security Excuse me sir, could you come to the Office for a moment? Room 504 please I'm sorry to bother you sir, but there is a young lady here who claims you are expecting her Fine I'm sorry for bothering you sir Not tonight darlin. He's not expecting anybody. Now who are you working for? An Agency, or a Madame? What are you insinuating? - We got another one here, sir -We'll need to know your name and who you're working for - Nobody I work for myself - Why do you protect them? Do you think they'd raise a finger to help you? If you don't cooperate with us, we'll have to phone the police - You've got no right to keep me here - We've got your picture now If we catch you in here again it'll be the police straight away - Can I leave now? - By all means madam [ ♫ Classical instrumental ♫ ] Will you accept the offer? If I did.... .. you'd hold me to ransom forever We'd find you a place for the girl This place....for you and me Your secret place - Yes, you would And where would that put me? I'd be a charity case for the rest of my life Be realistic Jane This is right She'll inherit from my side sooner or later We're offerring to make it sooner You don't give property, without claiming property They're not doing this for "love" - You're being perverse - The situation is perverse You can snap your fingers and conjure up 'Homes & Gardens' Makes anything I do seem pointless - Why can't you..accept help when its offerred? Anybody would think to want to end up in the gutter - I'm nowhere near the gutter - What about Lucy's future? - Are you worried that she'll be underprivileged? - Women do have a ... visible... reputation for a social mobility.. .. in either direction .. - And you'd like Lucy to know where she belongs? Jane.. I thought you'd be pleased? - Doesn't matter.. Either I'm... in your debt... Or.. I'm perverse I did think there was a way not be implicated in all this [ ♫ classical instrumental ♫ ] - Nick? You can't just give up like that You gotta put up some kind of a fight We were fighting at home We can go on fighting up there Down here it's like shadow-boxing You can't even see the enemy! You end up thinking its all your fault - But that's just what I felt like at home It was different for you, you had a job I never got near that battlefield You didn't want a part-time job up there You took one down here But down here it doesn't mean as much Least you feel like you've got a choice - In your head - Well, that's a start - We knew what we were aiming for at home - The kids and the night shifts at the biscuit factory? Me facing part-time labour What about you? Full-time and "organised"? If you were lucky We didn't aim for that! -Ya gotta take what you can get - Never asked for more? Don't you care about what I want? - Course I do Down here, I just dont know what it adds up to - What you want it to add up to? What did it add up to back home? Whatever you put into it you always come out with the same song On your 18th birthday everything fell into place You suddenly felt like you had this "Grand Plan" And if you shifted a whole lot of cards around you so you didn't dare.... - we cannot escape that, just being down here - Well.. at least we made a move! - I don't know what you want! I want more than you get from 'doffing your cap' (ie being a servant) [ ♫ piano music ♫] [ ♫ upbeat classical instrumental music ♫]
