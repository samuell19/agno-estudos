Gio. Come on, come on. No! Baby. I don't wanna go! Listen, listen, listen to me. Come on, come on, come on. Come on, come on. It's okay, baby. It's okay, honey, it's okay. Pick up, pick up, pick up. Listen to my voice, baby. It's okay, it's okay. When was the first time you were contacted by this inspector? A bout a year ago, I think? I was at work when I got a call from HR asking why there was a man by the name of Inspector Davis attempting to confirm my address of employment so that he could serve me judgment papers. For the next four months, he continued to call my job, blow up my cell phone, threaten to have me arrested. He harassed my daughter in Memphis, my ex-husband, telling them that I was a deadbeat. I lost weight, I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep, I almost lost my job. All of this for a 10 year old debt. For $453 and 12 cents. Your witness, Counselor. Ms. Reynolds, out of curiosity, how did you trace this Inspector Davis as an employee of my client? I Googled the number that kept showing up on my caller ID, that led to a consumer's forum where there were plenty of other people receiving similar calls. I traced that to AMG Receivables. Do you have any real proof, recordings of conversations? Well, no. Verified witness statements? Was that a no? No. Surely your phone bill will show proof of the calls. Did you bring a copy of that bill with you today? I'm no longer with that phone company. 'Cause you didn't pay your bill. Objection. Overruled! I was a few months behind, yes. In fact, other than the phone bill and this medical debt in question, you've got quite a few derogatory marks on your credit for failure to pay. Isn't that correct? Correct. Three repossessions, an eviction, four credit cards currently 120 days past due. I've fallen on hard times. So hard that you're now suing my client for thousands of dollars for allegedly collecting on a debt that you lawfully owe. How is that any different from extortion? Objection! Come on, Mike, please. Withdrawn. To another outright dismissal, what is that, four in a row, Michael? This one's a little too close for comfort thanks to Inspector Davis over there. Eat a bag of dicks. Oh, I'm sorry, you must have me confused with your old cellmate. What the fuck? You motherfuckers need to start taking this shit seriously. There's no way you can operate a business like this on the defense. Yeah, says the Jew. I can't with this guy, Brandon. This guy is the driving force behind AMG, Michael. The type of paper we collect, we're good at what we do because we use alternative methods of recovery. Ever buying Saver Paper? Where the fuck is the fun in that? Look, I'm just trying to protect what you've built. The reality is, the climate's changed. The FTC, CFPB, FCC, they've all caught wind of what's going on. 17 operations have gone down in the past 6 months. The number of FDCPA lawsuits like this one tripled last year. It's a different animal. Fine, I tried. What is this? It's porn. Just that trainee shit that he's into. Close, it's actually my bill. Your E&O declined the insurance claim on this lawsuit, now you have to pay me directly. So, do you want to cut me a check now, or send me a wire- - Fucker. All right. - Come on, come on. - Want me to cut you a check? I'll cut you a fucking check right now. You piece of shit! Come on, come on. Get your fucking wombat under control or- - Hey, go fuck yourself! I mean it! In through the nose, out through the mouth. Sit down. God. Your blood pressure must be sky high. You take your pill today? I'm good. Here. You remember in sophomore year when you dropped like a sack of shit, speech final? Hm? Well, fuckin' Tommy Slate's mom was the nurse that day. Yeah, I was looking for an excuse to bask in those titties for a few hours, you know? She did have a great pair of tits. Oh, God, did she. Fake. Stop! You could never tell the difference. I mean, I was always more of an ass man. Mm. Clearly you never discriminated. Missy Novak? Dude, I mean her chin looked like two fuckin' testicles hanging from her lower lip. Right? She had a dick face, bro, you know it. Yeah, but great ass. Great ass. Dick face, bro. You think maybe the Jew could be on to something here? What do you mean? Paper quality. I'm just saying, I think that maybe we should keep our options open here. We got a stack of bullshit lawsuits sitting on your desk right now that we gotta pay outta pocket to defend. So, maybe it can't hurt to diversify the portfolio a bit. You're joking, right? No. Look, we buy some repo packages from Chase Auto, we collect on the deficiency balance. We run some hard pulls. Hell, if that doesn't work, we file an action to collect, right? It's all legit. You know, we're good at what we do. Right? That's what gives us seven figure years. And we're about to bet it all on the biggest package in receivables history, so I need you focused. Okay? We push the envelope. And then it's fuck you money, per quarter, for life. Fuck you money. Fuck, Brandon. That's what it's all about, nothing else. Fine, but I'm not going back inside, bro. I'm not gonna let it happen again, okay? Tonight is the start of something transcendent for our company, and I need you. You're my brother. Mhm. Yo, Moss! It's time. Hey. Watch it, puta. Oh, hiya, how you doing? I'm good. Oh, it's so good to see you. We haven't seen your wife at the club for a while. Yeah. Um... Well, it was nice to see you. Thanks for all your years of membership with us. Ma, Dad. I guess I didn't catch you guys this morning. Just figured there was some kind of scheduling mix up. Do you guys miss me? I mean, hey, it's been 18 months with no visit. Why don't we take this conversation outside? No, no, no, no, no, we can do it here, I mean, we're all essentially family, right? Come on outside, now. No, here. What the hell? You've already destroyed the family name. Why not milk it? I made a mistake, Dad. You're a drug dealer, a felon. What did you expect to happen when you got out? Sean's home, everybody! Let's hit the links, party time. Look at her. Look what you did. Your own mother. All the Xanax and Klonopin in the world will never be able to fix this. I'm so sorry, Mom. We are well past the point of apologies. What's it gonna take? I'll cut you a check, right now, just to disappear. And then what, we're done? 20 grand? Are you buying me off? 30 then? Mom! Okay. You want to talk numbers, let's talk numbers. How about 15? The numbers of years that you used this disgrace of a son to market Maas Jewelers to your community, placed some pictures of my three consecutive All-Valley MVP awards on your storefront to justify insane markups. Huh? $75,000. Oh, that's a small price to pay to ostracize the same kid that changed your colostomy bag daily for weeks on end after your prostate removal. 100,000. How could we ever forget that time when I was 14 and I read the eulogy at papa's funeral because you were too shit-faced to get your act together and be a rock for your own family when we needed you most? $500,000! Done. Stay the hell out of our lives, you disgraceful piece of shit. Mid six-figures from old man Moss. Fuck me. I'm impressed. You know, I played skins with that cheap prick a few times. There's a reason they call him alligator arms, you know what I'm saying? Of course you know what I'm saying, you're his son, or were his son. Here, take a look at this. Get your act together and be a rock for your whole family when we needed you most! $500,000! What the fuck is this? It's a job interview. Yeah, okay, I'm a convicted felon. It's a pre-requisite in my field. Which is what exactly? Collection. Brandon. Sean. Are you coming? Are you kidding? It's not gonna drive itself. Got anywhere better to be? I'm heading out, I'll be back later. Love you, mama. Who's the twink? New blood. I'll sit in the fuckin' back. Well, if it ain't the fuckin' bizarro Robin Hood in the flesh. How's the receivables business treatin' you? Well, hopefully you're about to tell me. Accounts? Over 40K. Average per six figures worth of debt. Some tasty asset cows, we're talking potentially nine zeros. And that's a shit ton of deadbeats. Main stage, give it up for Svetlana! Yo. Yo. We're good. Problem? You're light. Well, considering the amount of bad paper you sold us last month, I'd say we're heavier than your mom's period. What the fuck did you just... Tell the glory hole to relax. Relax! Bad paper. The majority. Previously paid to another agency, or belonging to individuals who have been deceased, or filed for chapter 7. If the packages are what you say it is, then great, we can resume business as usual. It's legit. It better be. I'll meet you outside. You should probably ice those. She's cute. Excuse me. Hey. Um... For the dance. Oh, look, sorry, I don't have time for a private. I have to take my son home. Is that your real name, Svetlana? Do I like Russian to you? Thank you. Hey, mijo. Hey, mijo. So, what is it, Halloween or something? My uniform. What are you, a stripper? Are you fuckin' kidding me? You told me you had a cashier job. I did. So between that and Edgar, you can't- - Edgar hasn't been by the past three months. Did you try both his cells? Disconnected. I'll handle it. I'll handle it. How? How exactly? I have to get ahold of Edgar. Did you not just hear me? I'll figure it out, all right? I'll find him. Oh, from in here, huh? With a sundial? That's great. In the meantime, my phone's been blowing up 20 to 30 times a day from debt collectors because I can't pay our bills. Hey, hey, you watch yourself. These people are threatening to sue me, ruin my credit. We've been evicted. Then Uber or some shit 'til I figure it out. With Gio in the car? You promised you would take care of us. You promised. Let's go. All right, everybody meet Sean, the fuckin' new guy. There we go. And don't let his white bread bougie appearance deceive you. He's a piece of castaway trash just like all of us. All right? So let's treat the kid with a little bit of respect, huh? I.e. no tampon strings hanging out of his herbal tea, Juanita. Man, that shit was an accident, Rossy baby. Well, that accident cost us 60K and a workman's comp settlement there, Aunt Jemima. Don't make me get up out of this chair, I'll beat that ass. Oh, you gonna beat that ass? You mean eat that ass. Maybe. Can anybody guess what this number represents? The largest portfolio in receivables history. And as of late night, it belongs to us. So, what does that mean? Well, for starters, each and every collector in this room has the potential to clear 7 figures this quarter. Think about that for a moment. Think back to when most of you were just getting out of incarceration. Turned down for job after job. Competing with society for opportunities they were never gonna give you, for less than minimum fuckin' wage, by the way. Look how far each and every one of you have come working at this company. Now, the bad news is, even pennies on the the dollar, I had to beg, borrow, and steal just to finance this package. So I drained the operating account and the reserves, meaning no guaranteed salaries. If anybody has an issue with that, there's the fuckin' door. Let's get down to it then. The portfolio is divided into tiers. Each represents a cluster of accounts. The bottom of the pyramid consists of the low hanging fruit. Primarily medical debts still within a 7 year credit reporting window. Easy to collect, but obviously lower in value. The row above that gets more difficult. The statute credit card deficiencies. And above that is zombie debts 10 years or older, and so on and so on and so on and so on. You get the picture, right? Each collector keeps 10 points on money received. What you'll notice is the number of boxes at the bottom correlates directly to the amount of people in this room. What you also notice is the second column from the bottom consists of one less box. Can anybody explain to me the reason why? Lowest total in the first round doesn't make the cut for the second. Exactly. Darwinism. So, what happens to the last man standing? Person, sorry. He or she will have the privilege of competing with Ross for the top of the pyramid. A mid 7 figure account. Winner of that splits 50/50 with me on the take. Any questions? When do we start? 30 fuckin' minutes ago. You're over here, rook. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Cupcake, you don't get a chair. You're over here. Right here in the corner. You gotta be kidding. Nope. All right. Don't fuck up. Thanks. Okay, Regina Becker, what you got? Hello? Yeah, hi, can I please speak with Regina Becker, please? Who is this? This is Steve, from AMG Receivables. I'm calling about a $1,892 debt you owe to Roundtree Dermatology. No, I had insurance, and I gave them my information. Well, they said it wasn't covered. I'm not paying them a dime. They almost burned my toe off when they tried to freeze that wart. Albert, I really don't want to see this on your credit report, so what if I can get the hospital to cut the bill in half, okay? I have no money- - But that's not my problem. You listen to me, you bloodsucking leech. Okay, I'm listening. My mother has been in the hospital for 6 months. She's got chronic gout. I've got 3 kids to feed. Are you even listening to me? No, you look. This is a work number. Don't call here again, I know my rights. It's not about rights... I've still gotta pay rent this month, just not possible right now. I could take a card over the phone. I'm sorry, I got no job right now, I just can't do it. I need a commitment from you on this bill, sir. I'm a female. You just called me sir, ma'am. Or I'm gonna have to mark your file as a refusal to pay. I don't give a damn what you do, just don't call here anymore. Hey! Wait, wait, wait! Hey, wait, wait! Fuckin' shit! Tu madre! Pendejo! Fucking shit! Fuck! I'm only 10 days behind, and I spoke to somebody over there last week telling them that I'd be a little late. I've made arrangements to pay and you still take my car? No, I understand that it's not the first time, but look, I am trying, I'm doing my best. I just need my car back, okay? Hello? Fuck! Come on. Hey. All right, so halfway through round one you got Juanita at first, Gerald second, mixed bag for the rest. What about the kid? I don't know, man. Kid seems broken. Well, put Humpty Dumpty back together, okay? Since when do you give a donkey's twat? Just do me the solid. Trust me, the kid's got potential. Fine. Wait, hold on, are you at Daddy's Angels at one in the friggin' afternoon? Goodbye, Ross. Wow! Excuse me. Is Svetlana working today? I haven't seen her. Ooh, mamacita. Where the hell have you been, Edgar? Mexico City for a while, jump and all. So you can't call, shoot me a text? I had to ditch both burners. Do you have any idea what we've been through? Judging from the looks of you, I say you've been having muchas fiestas. This is funny to you? Just relax. What is this? It's all I got. Where's the rest of it? Call it a finder's fee. Wow. When Mario finds out about this, he's... Let go of my mom! He's stuck in a cell for the rest of his miserable life. You think about that, huh? Fuck that, new leadership now. Consider yourself lucky I even came back to give you anything, you ungrateful puta. You really want more money, huh? Maybe you and me can work out another arrangement, huh? Huh? Yeah. Baby. Baby, please. I'm out of Xanax. You were supposed to get me a refill. You need help. You wanna help me? Get me my fucking meds. Baby, you're sick. You haven't left the house in months. Please, I need my wife. Come on, when was the last time that we went on a date night, huh? Oh, is that what this is about, Bran? Hm? You wanna get laid? Come on, honey. You wanna get fuckin' laid? Stop it. Huh? Come on, stop. You wanna fuck? Stop it! Let's fuck. Huh? Is that what you want? You wanna fuck me, Brandon? Is that what you fuckin' want? Huh, Bran? Is that what you fucking want? You want to have another fucking baby, is that what you fucking want? You want another fuckin' baby? Huh? So you can murder him too? Is that what you want? Wake the fuck up! I've listened to most of the tapes, and you're well on your way to being the first man out. I don't know what the hell Brandon sees in you, but he's my boy. Oh, yeah, Regina Becker. First little cunt that exposed you. One shot deal here, cupcake. Regina Becker. Yes, who is this? Tom Ross with AMG Receivables. Did I catch you at a bad time? A bad time? It's 7:30 on a Saturday morning, plus I already disputed this debt, and I told you to stop calling me. I know my rights. Actually, you asked us to stop calling you at work, you never mentioned your cell phone. I want you to stop calling me in general. All phones, just stop, okay? Absolutely. But I'm just going over your credit report here, and I see that you've just applied for a refile on your first mortgage, is that correct? Yes, my application's still pending. Why? Well, right now your credit score is a 650, which is marginal, but if you force me to report this debt to Experian that's gonna drop you down to 520? Wait a second. Yeah. It's highly doubtful that a lender's gonna approve a refile on a credit score that low. In fact, what's likely to happen is that after your denial, you're gonna lose your house. And then your Visa card rates will triple, if they don't cancel them all together. All because you were too stubborn to live up to a medical obligation. Insurance was supposed to cover it. And that may be the case, Miss Becker, but that's between you and Anthem Blue Cross. If you would like to stay in your home for the foreseeable future, how about you just give me your debit card number right now, and we can make this all go away. You do your homework before you pick up the phone. Okay? Pull their credit reports, scour their social media feed. You learn as much about the deadbeat as you can so you can expose their Achilles' heel, that's when you hit them. You threaten to take away the one thing that matters most to them. You close every time. Thanks. And just so we're clear, if you tell anyone that I did this for you, I will rip your heart out of your fucking chest and wipe your vagina with it. Okay? Buckle up, fellas. We're about to get a serious contact high from all the coke and booze seeping out of his pores. How's my son doing at your little house of extortion? Well, why don't you call him and you can find out? I'm afraid that ship has sailed. Don't judge me, Mr. Debt Collector. One day, if and when you become a father, maybe you'll understand why I did what I did. How absolutely sick he made me and my wife, and the pain he caused our family. You know, you and I, we have more in common than you think. You see, we both used to be dads. The difference is you gave up that right with one fell swoop of your signature on a fucking checkbook. See, my fatherhood was ripped from my soul. You don't know the meaning of pain. You disgust me. And make sure you don't ever fucking talk to me ever again. What the fuck are you two looking at? Turn around. Come on! Hey. You snore like a hog. What are you playing? Cuphead, the hardest game ever. You want to play? Yeah, sure. Okay, here. No! Over there! Wait, watch out. No, go over there! Here you go. Last night, um- - Yeah. I was afraid to put you in an Uber, you could barely babble your address. I can't remember anything, to be honest. I just hope I wasn't saying anything too dumb. I'm really sorry to hear about your son. Yeah. I... I haven't talked about Sammy in a very long time to anyone. That kid was my best friend. You know? Yeah, I know. What? Can we get dessert? He always wants dessert. We can get dessert. We don't have to. No, it's fine. Can I get the dessert menu? Mhm. Thank you. Can I give you this? Thank you so much. Look, buddy. Here. Yes! Hello? Hello, Mr. Heller. This is attorney Les Marcus of How & Lindow pre-litigation department. I'm calling about your delinquent Capital One credit card account. Capital One? I ain't use that card in years. Well, that may be true, but it appears you left a significant balance when you canceled the card, which with interest, has now accumulated to $15,475 dollars and 85 cents. You're out of your mind, that's impossible. I'm afraid it's not, Mr. Heller. And unfortunately, Capital One has instructed me to initiate a lawsuit against you, unless you can take care of the balance today. I can't afford that kind of money, so go ahead and sue me. Okay, that's fine. We'll send a processed server down to your diner at approximately 4 p.m. No, no, wait, wait, wait. Don't come to my place of work. I will get fired, and I need this job, man. Well, I suggest you do something to take care of your obligations, sir. If not, we'll be forced to serve you personally at your work. We'll also get a judgment against you and garnish your wages. Highly doubtful that your boss will be very appreciative of having to deal with the sheriff on that situation. Please, man, I just can't afford to pay that much. I'll check in with the client, see if they can take a slight reduction on the balance, get you on a payment plan. Sound good? Okay, sure, yeah, whatever. Closed. Thank you. Cash money, baby. Sorry, but I don't think I can go that low unless you give it to us in a lump sum. Well, I get it, but that's just not my problem. You're gonna have to do better than that, Mrs. Force, or I really don't want to intercept that tax refund you were expecting. Uh huh, yeah. That's all I need. Have you thought about taking out a payday loan to cover this debt? Sure you can. Here, I'll tell you what, I'll leave you the offer open for 24 hours. How's that sound? Mr. Humphrey. Yeah, we've got you at $1,647 dollars. That's not gonna cut it. Okay, great. Yes, sir, that's a deal. I'm gonna transfer you over to Juanita, she can take down your credit card info ASAP. All right? Thank you. Everybody, listen up! Next round, complete. Daniel, get the fuck out. Yo, Brandon! Where the fuck are you, bro? Answer my calls! Fuck! Here you boys go. The apex of the pyramid. What do we know about it? High profile mortgage debt, virtually uncollectible. We're gonna have to be real creative on this one. Well, you don't seem too concerned. At the end of the day we 10x'd our money, we all made personal profit, and we got cushion for the next run, right? I think they forgot the vodka. Ay, ay, ay. We've been partners for what, 16 years now? Best friends for longer, right? Yeah. So, is there anything you need to tell me? What do you have in mind, Ross? Oh, I don't know, like did you have a giant fucking brain tumor or an organ eating amoeba, or some kind of shit that I need to know about? Because you haven't been in the office for weeks, you're not returning phone calls, you're not returning texts. The timing of it really sucks a dick considering everything that's at stake here. Now, if Sean wasn't out here slaying it for us, who by the way, I taught to do this as a favor for you while you were jerking off in some titty bar, but that's besides the point. If Sean hadn't been out there slaying it for us, we would've lost our investment and its portfolio. Right. If you stop worrying about my personal life and start worrying about the hotshot, then- - Are you fucking kidding me? What are you doing here? Business meeting. I see. Rough night? It's none of your business. You didn't deposit the check. Why? You know, maybe part of me thought that there was a chance of a reconciliation, who knows? Who cares? It's all history. Your mother. She's spiraling downward. You should get in touch with her. She's your family, Sean. No, AMG Receivables is my family, it's my life. I found my calling, so give her my best. Fucking fuck! Aw, shit. Ah, shit. Fuck. Fuck! Don't just fucking stand there man, get your ass in here. Oh, bless you child. Take a seat there, and watch out for Walter. Oh! Fuck me. You know, seeing you go to town on that half naked in your robe really gives me the feels. Yeah, well, go fuck yourself. San Quentin doc diagnosed me with an enlarged left ventricle years ago. I've just gotta get it under control. My heart's too big. How long did you serve? 5. Shit. Yup. Felony battery. Tossed the starting linebacker in high school through a glass door. His daddy was a high powered attorney, go figure. Made sure I did real time despite the plea. He just knocked the shit out of Brandon, I was steppin' in. All 'cause this shitbag wouldn't pony up on his losses from a football wager. Bookie Brandon. That makes sense, given the current profession. Oh, before his glamorous existence, Brandon Cazz was dirt poor. Sophomore year in high school his family immigrates from Russia, leave all their money behind. He moves into the duplex next door, and I'm thinking oh, great, another fuckin' beetle eater in the slums, right? But he was different. I took him under my wing. Actually, it turned out to be the opposite. Right out of the gate, he comes up with this idea to start taking bets in high school. You know, he crunches, I collect, it was perfect pairing. Worked out well for years too, until that night. Then you got out, and the rest is history? And now, here you sit, looking to extort money out of a drug cartel lieutenant. From his wife. So, why me? I need help. And from where I'm sitting, it looks like you do too. 50/50? All right. Let's hear it. I'll come pick you up after work. At 3 in the morning? Yeah, I'll still be up. Okay, I gotta go. Someone's at my door. Hi, Miss Salinas? Agent Frida Lando with INS. You might if I step inside? I did not give you permission to enter this house. My husband is on his way home. Well, I guess we'll be waiting for a while. How long was his sentence again? 64545 Homewood Circle. 10,750 square feet, 8 bedrooms, indoor pool. Racketball court, 7 car garage. It's a hell of a property, if I do say so myself. Talk about life coming at you like a fright train, huh? Yes, I once lived a glamorous existence, and now my husband is locked up, our house is foreclosed upon, and we lost everything. The American dream. Are you here to rub salt on the wound or does your visit serve a purpose? I don't know if you recall, Miss Salinas, but when the DEA arrested Mario, your house was seized as a matter of right. However, unbeknownst to us, your husband had previously refinanced his second mortgage, freeing up almost 5 million dollars in cash, which has seemingly disappeared. Now, in order for us to take possession of that property, we had to pay off to lean on the second in order to get free and clear title. I'm not following. Essentially, you owe us a very large debt. I'm here to collect it. I don't know if you noticed, but I'm not exactly swimming in cash right now. Are you a U.S. citizen, Miss Salinas? Neither is your son, right? I do not wish to speak with you or answer your questions, I am exercising my constitutional right under the Fifth Amendment of the- - Okay, look. You may give off the appearance of being destitute, Miss Salinas, but I happen to know for a fact that your husband transferred a very large sum of money to an account in Mexico City right before he went inside. Now, if the U.S. government is not in possession of the full four and half million dollars within the next 7 days, I've been instructed to come back here with half a dozen ICE agents and throw your ass in jail, and deport your son to Nicara- - No, don't you dare take my son! I'm sorry, Miss Salinas, I have my marching orders. And you have a week to come up with four and a half million dollars. No, wait, no, please. I don't know anything about this money. Well then, I suggest you familiarize yourself with your husband's business affairs. Okay? Well? We're in play. What's next? Now we wait. You lied to me. Oh, come on, don't start this shit again. I'm not talking about that, Mario. I'm talking about all the debt. The lines of credit you took out on our homes, the back taxes you owe the IRS. That's on me, you don't have to worry. No, that's on us. Specifically on Gio, your seed. And they want it all back. Who? The U.S. government, the IRS, the INS, who knows. All I can say is that they paid me a visit, and if I don't deliver it, ICE is gonna come knocking down on my door and take our son away. You know what's been happening at the border? Children getting separated from their families. They're getting sick, they are dying. That can happen to Gio. No. No! How much? 4.5 million. They know about the accounts, Mario. The money you hid from them, from us. Hey, we were supposed to be a team. We're supposed to be partners. It was an insurance policy to keep you safe until I got out. Edgar was supposed to handle this. Until you got out? You're serving two consecutive life sentences. You saw how we've been living, what I've been doing to myself to keep this family above water. I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry. You have to make it up to me. Cash out that policy. Please. Wake up. Ross. You know, it's not every day that your girlfriend stands you up. Fuck that guy! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Wait. Just wait, just wait, just wait. Look, it's not a good time, okay? Can we talk about this later? Not a good time? No. I was up all night waiting for you. Like, no drugs all night, you could at least text me. I said I was sorry. Brandon, I need you to leave. What are you not saying? Brandon, leave, please. You know, if you're in trouble- - No! I can help you. Don't touch me. It's a family issue, okay? You're not my husband, I'm not your responsibility. Fuck. Jesus Christ. He's playing us. It doesn't make sense. I told you, he's off. I'm not gonna let him dick us over. Okay. Agent Frida Lander. Enjoying the view? How can I help you, Miss Salinas? You'll have your money by 4:30 tomorrow. Until then, give us one night of peace. Okay? Let's hope it's all there, for your son's sake. What about Brandon? Fuck him. He's my problem. Hey buddy, is that you? Yeah, can't really talk right now. Are you guys okay? I'm worried about your mom. Not sure. She's been freaking out about my papi. What about him? Something about how he owes someone a lot of money. Your dad. Gio, we gotta go. What's his name? Gio, baby, let's go. Nice of you to finally show up for work. What was the play, huh? I'm not following. Once you collected, what bullshit were you gonna spew to hide that money from us? Kinda funny that the mark just happens to be your girlfriend. You know, I think you need to back down on this one. Oh, I'm not gonna back down on shit. Brother, it's not about the money, okay? Not on this. No, bullshit, it's about the money. It's always about the fuckin' money, that was our deal from the get go. Back when we started taking bets, and muscling needs from their daddy's allowance. I sacrificed five years of hard time for you, Brandon. Five fucking years! And this is how you pay me back? You go and get pussy-whipped. Bro, your head is so far up her fuckin' vagina, I can't even pull you out with a rope, and you're out of your damn mind if you think for five seconds that her kid's gonna replace Sammy. Shut the fuck up! Ross, I'm sorry. Fuckin' stop! Brandon, Brandon. Help. Hey buddy, hey. Hey, man. Outside. Pay the money and walk away. Oh my God. No! Gio, come on, come on. No! Baby. I don't wanna go! Listen, listen, listen to me. Come on, come on. Come on! Baby, baby. Go, go, baby. Go, go, baby. Go, go. It's okay. It's okay, honey, it's okay. Pick up. Pick up, pick up, pick up. Listen to my voice, baby. 20,800 square feet, fully connected to a high speed T1 line. Capacity for over 100 work stations. A real find in this space. What was this before, again? Something in finance, I believe. Quite the baller executive suite, am I right? What are they asking? 16,500. Didn't someone die in here? Never heard that. I'm sure they can work with us on the rent, by the way.
