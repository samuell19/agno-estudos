I've read so many good things about what you guys are doing, what else? I've really get along with most people. I got a lot of friends, do you even care about that, no. Thank you. Hey! - Oh my God, hey! - What are you doing here? Interview. Me too, marketing role? Yup. - Harry. - Hey. Anyway, we should grab a coffee, catch up. Yeah, cool. So where'd you come from today? Hawthorn. Oh, great I've come from Toorak. Ah, right around the corner. Yeah, not too far. Sorry, the traffic was so bad. Hey. Hey. How'd you go? Is that everything for Table 8? Yeah. Hey, don't stress about the job, there'll be others. I know, I just feel like I keep trying and it just gets me nowhere. Try playing a show to three people. Okay, seriously, just put up some selfies on your band page and at your next gig, there'll be like a line of teenage girls. Ooh, sign me up. You should listen to me, you know. I have a degree in digital marketing. Yeah? Yeah. How's that going for you? See ya. See ya. Thank you. One more, right? You guys are loving it. It wasn't for nothing, look that one's good. Yeah, look at all those people. I'll crop it. Genius. Yeah, I do know how to do this. Genius. Can I just get the same? All right, I think I'm gonna go. Don't, don't, come on, one more drink. - Couple more drinks. - No, no, it's getting really late and I've gotta do Mel's shift tomorrow. Who cares? Someone's gotta fix up your mistakes at work. Whatever. All the jobs that I have to do. You didn't know about it. It's fine, I've got it, see? Coordinated. - You're home. - Bye. You need a good night's sleep. Yep, that's the plan. All right. Thanks for walking me. No worries. But you know, just because you did doesn't mean I'm gonna let you in. Obviously. - Obviously. - All right. That's definitely not happening. Yeah, thanks for the entertaining walk, and insulting my band. Yeah. - Bye. - Bye. I've just got hello. Is that creepy? - Yes, it is. - Okay. Just do something really casual. Like, maybe I can send him an emoji. Just don't send him the eggplant one. As if, I'm not like you. Ah-ha. Come on Tazzie, come on, come on, come on. Choo-choo-choo-choo, come on puss. What is that noise? Did you just come up with that? No, I had a cat when I was a kid, - that's how you get 'em. - Did you? Yeah. - Aw, that's nice. - Come on, choo-choo-choo-choo, puss, puss, puss, come on. It's not working. No, it's not working. No, she's staying there for a few more hours. She's not so friendly. She is really friendly. Really? It's just with certain people. So maybe you're giving off bad vibes. Really, bad juju, doesn't like me. Mm-hm, bad juju. I should probably go. Okay. Well, thanks for helping me with the kitty litter and, you know, the couch thing. Anytime, anytime. Are you gonna show me how to do it? - Mm-hm. - Okay. - Then go on. - Okay. I don't think I can do that. How do you get that much smoke in your mouth? You suck it in. Right, ready? That was really funny. I feel like I just burnt my lip. Did you? You did well, it was really... I did well, thanks. - Maybe that's enough... - When am I gonna feel it? Right away? - In a second. - Okay. Aw, I think I did burn my lip. - Does it hurt? - Mm-hm. - Ooh. - Is it burned? No. Oh, no, it is, holy shit. Is it really? Oh you're paranoid? Yeah. They're idiots. You're overqualified for the job. Seb, you're just saying that 'cause I didn't get it. I'm not saying that, you're really good at what you do. How do you know? 'Cause I've seen what you do. What do you mean how do I know? And you're a hard worker. Obviously there's something wrong with me. There's nothing wrong with you, you're just... I've been trying for months, man. You'll get there, it just wasn't the right fit. This was my mom's favorite spot. Really? She used to bring me down her heaps. - Seb give me.. - Hey, this is my kitchen. You can't come into my kitchen... - It's not your kitchen. - And just take things. Don't come in and just take things. I think it's Hok's kitchen, TBH. - Uh-uh-uh. - Give me the sauce. Don't eat my hair. Oh, my god. - What? - Look. 1000 likes. How much do you love me right now? It's really good, it's like salty and sweet. Hey, shut your eyes. Why? What are you doing, don't. Tell me what this feels like. Oh my god, it actually kind of hurts. It's like a horrible acupuncture. Oh, it is kind of weird. Yeah, it's really weird. Oh, hang on. Hello, Nina speaking. I like it. Oh, hi, yeah, good, thank you. That's amazing. Hurry up! Well, I'd be relocating from Melbourne, so could I have some time to think about it? Look how cute they are. No, you don't like that. - Mm-mm. - Why? Look at that celebration of love right here on the beach. - Look how happy they are. - Regret. - Oy. - Regret. Nah, that's pretty cute. It is pretty cute. What? I just wanna ask you something. It's kind of awkward. Don't. What? Let's hear it. Would you wanna do that one day, in the future? I've been thinking the same, kind of thing. Are you asking me now? Sort of. Oh, double awkward. No, I don't wanna see anyone else. Yeah, no, neither do I. Stop it.. No. You're in like a weird spot. So do you sing as well? - A bit. - No. No one's asked me to go on tour, put it that way. Huh? I had a meeting with a band. When? Last week. They contacted me on the fan page. You made that, didn't you? Mm-hm, yeah. It's pretty cool, they lost their front man so they need someone. For a little while. When is this tour? Won't I cramp your style, with your little groupies? Groupies? Where? Oy! You know I got that job I went for. - In Sydney? - Yeah. Turned it down. Why? Are you being serious? Yes. I mean, the whole time I've known you, this is all you've gone on about. What about you? You've got this amazing opportunity. I'd probably just fuck it up. What? And she really likes a mixture of half wet food and half dry food. Hey, how are you getting to airport tomorrow? Do you need a lift? No, I'm getting a train. Suit yourself. Aw. Are you gonna miss Mama when I go away? It's all right. Your service has been disconnected. Please contact customer services. Whoa! Thank God! What are you doing? You're okay? What? Where have you been? Why didn't you call? What are you talking about, Dad? Just once, it wouldn't have been too much to ask, would it? You're tanked, get off me. It's been a year, Seb. What have you done? Well, what'd you think would happen? Where's my guitar? With charity, mate. You dropped off the face of the planet. Stop bullshitting, I was here last night! Don't make things worse. I'm not! Where have you been? Nowhere! You in trouble? You're telling me I skipped a year, it's nuts, it's nuts! Stop being a little shit! - I'm not! - Tell me the truth! I am, just listen! You never listen, get off me! I'd listen if ya had something sensible to say and be honest! Thank you. Hey, Leah? Yes, one second. Okay, if a guy turns up looking for me, I'm not here, okay? A client? No, just someone you don't know, someone else. Can you wait? - Nina! - What? Can I explain? No, just go back to wherever you've been. But that's what I'm trying to tell you, I haven't been anywhere! I haven't been, I was just one the road! Yeah, why am I not surprised? I've lost a year! Well, I haven't, okay? So if you wanna piss your life up the wall, then fine, do it. Do you want me to call the cops? 'Cause I will if you keep... Yes, call the cops, call the cops, this is nuts! I don't even know what you're talking about anymore. This year, I don't remember anything! Just lay off the drugs, Seb. You sure he wasn't taking the piss? Maybe, but he was like literally begging me to believe him, weird. Why would he say something that's so like... I don't know, honestly. Do you think he still loves you? What do I care, anyway? What? No, it's just... What time are you leaving again? Why? I'm gonna come with. Stace! Did I disturb you? Are you okay, where's Seb? Oh, well, he's home. It's just, he keeps saying these things. I know. Well, is he on drugs? Does he owe someone money? I couldn't tell you. Yeah, well, have you asked him? Dad send you? I wanted to see you. I do care about you, you know. Not enough to believe me. Believe what? Have you taken something? Yeah, I'm on some mad trip. Can you stop? Stop what? Making out like this is some big joke. We're worried about you. I don't know what else to say. I just blinked, and... He actually believes he's disappearing into thin air. He needs help, Michael. All right, well, just keep him talking and, keep an eye on him. Don't let him disappear again. Do you remember that dinner at your dad's place? Like it was yesterday. You kept going on about how you're gonna pick up lots of groupies on the road. That was you. Sure. You can tell me if that's what happened, you know. Do you really think I would have left without you? Paramedic: What's him name? Sebastian. Don't worry we handle these situations all the time. Hey, give me that. - Seb... - Did you know about this? No, don't panic, Seb! - Seb! - Stop! It's for your own good Seb! Hey. What are you doing here? I was worried about you. You know, you're the one person that needed to believe me. Maybe I would believe you if what you were saying wasn't so crazy. Please, can you just come back with me? Honestly, I don't even know what... Seb? Seb, stop mucking around. Seb? I gave this to him a year ago. So what? It's the proof! - Proof of what? - It's proof he's telling, - he's telling the truth! - Proof of what? - The truth? - I'm telling you, I think he's telling the truth. I'll tell you what the truth is. There's something going on, just go! You still here? There was no one else around, you were the only one who saw this happen? Yes, how many times do we have to go through this? All right, listen, we've decided we're just gonna let you off with a warning - this time. - A warning, what for? Wasting police time is a serious matter. Look, we've spoken to Sebastian's father. We understand emotions are running high in the family at the moment, so... Okay, okay, I'm telling the truth. Look, we're not even gonna file a report, okay? So let's just end this now. Come on, you're free to go. Fine. Hey, Nina? Hey. What's wrong? It's um... Just Seb stuff. Didn't you guys go out last night? - Did you... - Mm-hm. Talk about things, what's going on? We hung out but, I don't know. I don't know when I'm gonna see him again. Aw, Neens, hey, hey, hey, hey. Aw, babe, I'm sorry. Can you try and tell me about it? - What happened? - I'm being so. No, you're not at all, not at all. Did he say where he's been? So are you back together, is he sticking around? He's just been traveling a lot. Maybe I am going nuts. Hey, hey, it's okay, it's okay! It's all right, I believe you. It's all right. I can't believe that happened again. Do you feel okay? What's the last thing you remember? I was just here with you. A year. Hey. - How is this happening? - I don't know how it's happening, could just... Why? I don't know, I don't know. I don't know, but it is, Seb, please... Stop telling me to calm down, please! - Okay. - It doesn't help. What's happened? How are you, how's my dad, how's... What? What happened? Your dad got into a bit of trouble. When? How'd you go? Wait here. Are you sure? Dad? Do you wanna talk to me? What's the point? The hell's wrong with you? I'm wonderful, mate. Don't! Look what you've done! You're just like your mother. What happened? Nothing. - No, what did he say? - I'm fine. Hey. You're okay? - Mm-hm. - Really? What? Just feel like I'm gonna lose everything. You're not, you've still got me. For how long? Have you told anyone? About you? It's weird, what am I supposed to say? That you're like randomly disappearing and reappearing. Could we not go to the cops? Uh, no way. Why not? They've gotta help. - Seb! - Why? Just trust me, okay? Don't! Listen, I've tried! I'll explain! What? They'll think you're crazy! They'll lock you up and put you in the psych ward or something! What else am I supposed to do? Just come home. Which is where? My place. What? Nothing. You're looking at me weird. You look different. Are you saying I look old? No, just different. Well, a year's a long time. Yeah. I don't wanna leave. We don't know that's gonna happen. Will you be here when I get back? If I go again? Mm-hm. You don't have to. No, I want to. I don't wanna go to sleep. Me either. You're not going to work today? Yeah, I'm not really feeling that well. Didn't get enough sleep, more like it. Seb was over. Like, Seb Seb? Uh-huh. Does that mean you guys are back on? Guess so. Well, that's good news, right? Yep. Well, maybe we should all go hang out sometime. You're gonna be late. See ya, Neens. See you. You're coming out with me. No. Yes, you're coming out with me, - come on, just you and me. - No, I don't feel like it. Aw, what, you don't wanna dance with this? You don't wanna dance with this? Do you do like an espresso martini? No, I don't want it, can I just get a vodka lime and soda? - Yeah. - What? No, get a cocktail! Martini sounds good. It's nice and light. Oh, hang on, wait, it's got tequila in it, I can't have that, that makes me really sick. - Hey! - Hey. Hello. Good to see you. You too. - Hey, you all right? - Hi, Kurt. - Yeah, yeah. - You good? Yeah, yeah, I'm good. - Okay, good. - Yeah, yeah, all right. - Hi, hey. - Hi. - Oh, hey, hey. - Hi. Hey, Ryan, Ryan, Nina, Nina, Ryan. I'm Ryan. It's nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, what's your name, sorry? Nina. - Nina. - Yeah. Ryan's a doctor. - Okay. - I'm a junior doctor. - Oh, that's nice. - And he's single! I'm at the Alfred. Are you? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, that's good. Thank you. What ward do you work in? I work at the cardiac ward. Okay, cool. Yeah, get to see a whole load of stuff. What about you, what do you... Sorry, I've gotta go. - Okay. - I'm really sorry. - It was lovely to meet you. - All right. - Okay. - Nina! What are you doing? What do you think? Docklands Drive. Yeah, hey! What's the problem? What? You're unbelievable. What's that supposed to mean? Ryan is totally into you. So? In case you've forgotten, I have a boyfriend. Right. No, I'm sorry, it's just... I'm not sure showing up once a year really qualifies. Okay, yeah, you just don't get it because you've never had a relationship that's lasted more than five minutes. No, I don't get it, Neen. This guy is fucking AWOL and I am your friend, okay? You need to get out, have some fun! Okay, you're making it sound like I'm totally crazy, when I'm not. I'm fine, just because I'm not super happy all the time. Well, look, you know what? No offense, but it's really awkward bringing people around, okay? Thanks. Look, what is so wrong with just getting to know a couple of guys and letting them buy us some drinks? Come on, we used to do this all the time. Hey, did you wanna see me? Yeah, yeah, come in. How are you? Hey, yeah, good, what's going on? I just wanted to talk to you. Okay. I just received a call from Miranda. Yeah? Who got the invoices sent. Yeah, yeah. But it was the wrong invoice, it was Jackie, Jackie's invoice. Are you serious? Oh, God, oh, I'm so sorry! Yeah, well, I mean, the thing is, I've been noticing lately that you just haven't been yourself, at all. 'Cause you're normally so perky, and happy, and focused. You've been the opposite of all those things lately, and it's worried me. I'm so sorry, I just, I've just been so tired lately, yeah. Well... If you ever want anyone to talk to, you can talk to me. I think I just need to get on top of my sleep. And I will do that, but thanks. I'll handle this anyway, don't worry about it, it's fine. My God, I'm gonna kill you. Don't, I know what you're laughing at. I left you there. Yes, you left me there. I cannot believe that Johnny's so boring. Yeah, well, you know, I didn't wanna deal with him, so I left you with him. Yeah, I know, thanks a lot for that, jerk, Jesus. Oh my God, I would love a burger right now. - Yeah, I'm starving actually. - That would be so good, aw! Let's go get something, I don't wanna be here anymore. Let's finish this and go, what do you reckon? I actually can't, I've to, I've gotta go home, so, why don't you finish this little guy for me... Oh, you're leaving now? And, yeah, I've got to, I've got a, I've got a Skype session with my boyfriend, so... - Yeah, all right. - So, I've gotta go, but I will see you at work tomorrow. Bright and early, no two-hour breaks. - See you tomorrow, all right. - Yeah. - Alrighty. - All right. - Cool. - Such a nice day. - Yeah. - We should be in the park, not in the shopping center. I know, right, you know what? We should totally go and do that after we drop these guys at home. - I've got... - Get some chow, and... - Um, yeah. - Go to the park? I've got band practice at 4:30. Ah, do you? It's three, I mean, we got a bit of time. Nah, you should probably go to band practice. I mean, you guys need all the help you can get. Such a nice day. - Oh, hey. - Hey. How'd you go after the other night? Yeah, good. - Yeah? - Good, good, good. It was a good night, it was a big night. Really? Yeah. Sorry for bailing on you. It's okay. I feel really bad for doing that. Don't worry about it, it's fine. I kinda wanna make it up to you. You don't need to make it up to me. Yeah, I think I do. Do you wanna maybe get lunch or something this week? Like a work lunch? Yeah. Professional work lunch? Yes, very professional work lunch. Yeah, I'll have lunch with you. Okay, cool. I'll send you a calendar invite. - Ooh, profesh. - Yeah. All right, well, I better get back to work. You get back to work, slacker. Ooh, I got a couple good ones here. What are you looking at? Shoes. - Uh-huh. - On eBay. For work? No, for running, I'm gonna get fit. - Ooh, okay. - Yeah. Hey, if you want shoes do a little walkity-walk for me and I can tell you which ones will be good. I'm not doing that. Why, are you embarrassed? Yeah. Do it. Do it, there's only like 20 people in here. - Just walk up and down? - Mm-hm. And then you'll tell me what shoes to wear? - Mm-hm. - All right. Race you to the steps, yes! You said you weren't a runner! All right, I'm just gonna leave you there. Aw, god. You gotta lift. I was lifting my knees, but it helps when you're like a million feet taller than I am. You gotta get some better gear. What are you talking about? Well, these runners, look at this. What's wrong with this? It's inappropriate. It's not inappropriate. It's a little bit inappropriate. Sorry, should I not have done that? Sure it's okay to take a shower? Yeah, yeah, it's just straight upstairs, first door on your left. Cool. Cool. Hey, is full cream milk all right? Do you have almond milk? What, are you allergic? No, I just prefer almond milk. No I don't have almond milk. Oh. Very disappointed with you, then. Yeah. I like how one part of the ceiling is not painted, whilst the rest of it is very well painted. I know, do you know how hard it was for me to do that? I didn't have a tall person like you helping me. My arms got tired by the time I got to that bit. Yes, you just gave up. Yeah. Oh, well, maybe sometime I'll come round and help you finish it off. Yeah, maybe. Hey, you're not gonna, you're not gonna tell people about this, are you? About this? Yes, about this. I've got it at the top of my agenda on Monday's WIP sheet. Shut up! That's so, don't even joke about that, that's so ridiculous. It'd just be really awkward at work, you know? Well, we don't have to do this again at all, if you don't want to. I understand if you wanna keep it. Like a one-time thing. No, that's not what I meant, I just... Just think... It'd be really good if we could keep things casual. Yes, yeah, we can do that. - Okay. - Can just keep it caszh. Yeah. Just keep it caszh. No worries! What's up? Okay. I just did something brilliant. Does it affect me? - Mm-hm, yeah. - What is it? Tell me what it is. I've just booked two flights to India for us. - Did you? - Yeah, yeah. Oh my god, that's so exciting! They had a special of half price. Oh my god, oh is that it? - Yeah, for March 7 to 21st. - Oh, that's so cheap. It was the only time they offered that. - Lucky! - Yeah. Do I even have any annual leave left? You've got heaps of leave, I checked. Oh, do I? Yeah, work's quiet, days of leave. February always, March and February, it's always quiet. It's not really a good time, so. - What have you got on? - I just can't do it. Nothing. Then why can't you go? It's just not a good time, okay? And anyway, you shouldn't have booked them without telling me, or checking with me first. Oh, okay, don't worry about it, we'll talk about it later. Hey, can you just wait a sec? You've been shitty with me all afternoon. Is this about the trip? Yeah, I'm confused by it. I just can't go during those dates. Why can't you go? Can you just get a refund? No, they're nonrefundable. That's why they're so cheap. I just can't go, all right? I've got a friend flying to Melbourne one of those days, and I really wanna catch up with them. They're only here for one night. Why couldn't you just tell me that before? 'Cause it's Seb, and I didn't wanna hurt your feelings. Really? Yeah, that's, this is exactly how I thought you'd take it. I'm overreacting, am I? I'm just out of control. Why are you meeting up with him? Just out of interest. I don't know, because we used to go out together, and I just wanna reconnect with him. Aw, sorry, maybe I'll go catch up with my ex-girlfriend this weekend as well. Aw, god, yeah, okay. So are you meeting with him as a friend, or as more than a friend? Are you serious? What the fuck are we doing? I don't know, I don't know what to say. Pfft. Oh, shit! You coulda told me you - were thinking about moving. - Sorry, I didn't know. It's big. Yeah, it's nice, isn't it? A mosaic. - Yeah. - Wow. Do you like my courtyard? Yeah, it's really nice. See that little pond? It's got fish in it. Cool. Yeah. Wow, how do you afford this? Um, well, I am the new Marketing Manager at work. Oh, wow, congratulations. Yeah, thanks. They must really like you. Yeah. Do you want something to eat? Not quite sure what I've got. I don't mind. I mean, not much, but, do you want a glass of water, or, I'll give you a glass of water. Oh, this tap is like so finicky. Hey. Thanks. Are you okay? It's just weird. What? New house, glasses. A lot to take in. Fish Bowl. Mm-hm, I think it's new. Yeah? Oh, do you know what else is new? That joint. What is it? It's a really fancy Iranian restaurant. - Iranian? - Yeah. No? You're face is saying no. Sounds a bit healthy. It is quite healthy. What about burgers? Oh, really? Hm, I don't think I'm in the mood for it. What, you're watching your weight? No, just trying to be a little bit more conscious with my health and stuff. Very good. Wait, if I agree, will you stop giving me shit? Yeah. All right, all right, let's go get burgers. Burgers, yes. Hang on, is this with every piece of cutlery? Yeah. How have I never noticed this before? - You're not observant. - That's so weird. Yeah. Sorry, but I can't, I cannot deal with how you're eating that, it's so weird, you look so fonzy, like some posh dude from Toorak. Don't do that. Can you just touch it? Sometimes I have to use my lips. It's not like I can't. Can you just do it for me now? - All right, one, two. - Do it. Aw, did that feel weird and gross and... Ahh! Yep, yep, yep, yep. - Very good. - You're so weird. Okay, I'm done. Okay. I've got lots of fun stuff for us to do after this. Thought we can go into the city, there's these little markets on by the river. Ooh, or if we go into St Kilda, there's a beach DJ, if you wanna dance. Whatever. What do you mean whatever, what do you wanna do? We can do whatever, as long as we're hanging out. You've got some shtuff on... Do I? - Yeah, I'll get it. - Did you get it? I'll get it. What? Nothing. I'm just all herby, they put lots of herbs on the chips. Sorry, you don't have to kiss me if you don't want to. Yeah, it just takes me, just takes me a while to get back into it. What are you doing? Looking for a drink. Oh, okay, I've got some rose. - No, no. - It's really good. No? You got anything stronger? No, I'm not a bottle shop. Nothing? - No. - You got spirits or weed? No, did you not just hear me? Do you wanna watch a movie or something? No, could I use your phone? Yeah, okay. Thanks. Are you gonna do that in here? Are you awake? Sorry this is so hard. What time is it? Who's Jake? What? Who's Jake? He's my boss. No, wait. Wait. Hang on, Seb, just wait. Seb, stop! - What, what? - Just stop, listen to me, please... Get off of me. Please talk to me. Why didn't you tell me? Can you just stop yelling at me, please? No, I mean, this obviously isn't working so you don't have to wait. - Just stop. - Just stay, go away. - Please stop. - No. - Why won't you let... - Just go home! Hey, mate. - That's all? - Yeah. $6.80. How much? Tap. Declined, mate. Cash? Yeah. Man, you're short. Whatever. You cannot take this. Hey, hey, hey, hey! Fuck off, don't touch me! It's 20 fucking cents, what does it matter, huh? - Just relax. - Why? Why, don't tell me to fucking relax, huh? Okay, okay, man. Hey, I've got that presentation for you to look over for the meeting tomorrow. Great, thank you, I'll look at it later. Just pay particular attention to the, where is it? To the SEO page 'cause... Yeah, I'll look at it- - Yeah, I know, I'm just letting you know 'cause I've added some extra things that we hadn't discussed. I can't right now, I will look at it at some point. Thanks for delivering it to me. I'm really sorry about what happened. And I don't want to talk about anything personal. You wanna talk about work stuff, talk about work stuff and that's it. Everything else, keep it to yourself. Hey. It's in New Zealand. Okay. It's in New Zealand for six months. And I haven't said yes yet 'cause, I know what that means. Well, it's a really good opportunity, so... Maybe you could come with me. Oh, wow, it looks so different in here. Yeah, it's so bare. Yeah. Sorry I'm not coming with you. Are you sorry? Yeah. Eh, I don't know. Feels to me like you were, you were never in this. You were never in this. You just kind of used to me to fill some void that this other guy had left. Yeah, it's not as simple as that. That's pretty simple. If you wanna be with someone you find a way to make it work. You just find a way. Oh my god, you are so super cute! Happy Birthday! Thank you. All right, make a wish! - Come on. - Oh my god. - Make a wish. - Okay. Got it? - Mm-hm. - All right. You are such a jerk. Hey. - Hey. - Hey, Nina. - Nina, nice to meet you. - Hey, nice to meet you too. Should we go get a drink? Yeah, do you have anywhere in mind? Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's a really good - space this way. - Yeah. But I do have a story about this. I'm gonna show you my favorite alleyway in Melbourne. - Right. - This one. Uh, because I have to work. So? We're leaving on Friday night, you should come. Hey, it's a little thing called Jake's just left and I've inherited half his clients. So? Unlike you, I can't afford to go freelance. - It's cool right? - This is amazing! You didn't tell me she was loaded, Jesus! - Yeah, just keep on going... - This is awesome. Up here, straight ahead. Which one? - Yeah, just here. - Awesome. - Hey. - Hey! - Hey. - Hey. Hey, nice to meet you, good to see ya. You must be Lee. Yeah, mate, nice to meet ya. Hi. Hey. Didn't know you were coming. Yeah. Aw, look how cute they are! They're like following each other. It'd be so sweet to have a joint up here. As is a place, not an actual joint. Well.. Yeah. If you were loaded, which house would you buy? I like these ones altogether. - All of them? - Yeah. - You'd buy all of them. - I'd buy all of them. Probably, like that one down there, being that... The biggest one. - Yeah. - Yeah. It's weird, I can see you hesitating. Yeah, it's weird, um... How long do you have? What, is it a really long boring story, like all the other breakup stories? Yes. Is it? God. It's complicated, I shoulda seen it coming. Were you guys just not getting along, or? You just get caught in a routine, you know? Kinda sounds like you and Seb. No, wait, who's this? Okay, this guy would literally show up for like one night, and then just disappear. Why are you telling everyone this? I'm just telling it how it is. That's not how it was and it's not your thing - to tell anyway. - It is how it was, and we're just all sharing stories. - Okay, she doesn't wanna... - Okay, no, you're... - Talk about it. - Yeah. - Guys, let's just chill out. - Thank you. - No, no, no, no... - No, you're sharing my story. It's only a story. Yeah, you're sharing my story, and I don't appreciate it... I was there for it. - At all. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, - Stace, leave it. - And it affected you? Yes, it did affect me, Nina. It really affected my life. Okay, fuck off, Stacey. - No, hey... - No, I'm done. No, hey, Nina, come on. - Come back. - Yeah, leave, good one, Neens, that's real mature, that's gonna help the situation. Stace, would you just chill out? What? You brought her. Hey. Are you gonna come in and apologize? Yeah, what, wave my magic wand and make everything better? No, just don't ruin the weekend for everyone. Sorry if I don't really wanna be here. 'Cause of Stace? Yeah. Why did you come then? Because you forced me. I love it, you know, this is exactly what she's talking about. What, I thought it was cute. What would I do without you? I don't know, I ask myself that everyday. The block model suggests everything is relative. Your past could very well be somebody else's future. You know a lot about time travel, right? Oh, relatively speaking. What if it was happening to someone? Oh, then I'd ask them to bring me back Einstein's signature. No, I mean like skipping forward, missing bits. What if someone was here one minute and gone the next? Just vanishing for months at a time. Are you talking about someone specific? It's my boyfriend, Seb. Oh, then I'd suggest that you might want to swipe on to the next. It's not like that. It's really happening. Why don't you come with me and we'll go visit the university counselor. What if I could prove it? Do you think I'm doing the right thing? Honestly? You're miserable. I just know if we're together, everything will be fine. Didn't think you'd come back here. Where else would I go? Thought you'd moved in with Jake. You didn't really give me a chance to explain. Don't have to, I get it. I know it just wasn't the same with him. When we were together, it was like... He was over there and I was still thinking about you when I was with him. But I know what I want now. Which is? Us. There's no us, not for 364 days of the year. What if we could change that? How'd you go? As far as I can see, we have two options. One, we do nothing and hope that the pebbles stop skipping eventually. Two, we bombard you with a type of particle, try and anchor you down. But you have to understand, there's no guarantee. You could keep skipping even further ahead. Seb? Have you been here all night? Hm? Have you tried this? - What, what are you doing? - It's so good. I'm getting it. What do you mean you're getting it? We've got heaps at home. No, we don't have sweet. They're all the same, Seb. Can you put it back, please? It's $5. Yeah, my $5. Right. Hey, you're not dressed. You go, I mean, you haven't seen your friends for ages. So you're bailing. Seb, you do this every time, it's weird. Why do you even want me there? Was it last weekend or the weekend before? Weekend before. - Weekend before. - Yeah. And it was so bad, like one of the bridesmaids hooked up with the groomsman before they even walked down the aisle, in the rectory. I have to be up at six tomorrow. Ouch. Telling me to turn off the light? Yeah. Can I just finish this? Fine. Finish your book. Thank you. All right, I've got to get to work. Can you tidy up by the time I get back, please? Seriously. Yes, Mum. No, I asked her, I'm a gentleman. It's very traditional, very romantic, it was good. Well, congratulations, that's really, that's great. Thank you. Heard you and Seb were back together, that's good. Just like he's never been away, or? Well... Sorry, it's none of my business, I shouldn't have asked that. No, no, it's good, it's just a bit different. Right. Than doing the whole long-distance thing. Yeah, that would be hard. Feel like I dodged a bullet there. Really? Why did you wanna see me? I don't know, I just... No, it's great that things are good with you and Seb, though, that's awesome, patch things up. Seems like it's going well, that's what you wanted, yeah? Yeah. Yeah. You wouldn't want to spend years waiting for the wrong person.
