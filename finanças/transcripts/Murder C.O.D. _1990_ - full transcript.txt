Brandon, come on, that's enough. Let's go. Follow me. Come here, son. You got all wet. Come on, Christopher, come on, Tiffany. Is Blaine here? What is she, about 35 or so? - Yeah. - Yeah. See what she was wearin' today? Cheap. I know, yeah. See you on Tuesday, the following week. The following week? Only about as wide as your finger. Yeah, I'm not ready. Double talk, you know what I mean? Oh yeah, I mean. - It was good. It was so full on the top, and then she had a wig on the side. It was nice. I should have asked her what kind of in her hair. - Oh, Shelby, it shouldn't be a hard thing to ask. Yes. Fine, but you really have to do something more with your money, you have to find stronger investments. His lawyer's so efficient. Hi, I'm sorry I'm late. It's okay, I know you had to work. - Yeah, yeah, actually I didn't know if I was gonna be able to out in time, though. Even lost his lucky rabbit's foot, huh? I'm pooped from all that runnin' up and down hills. Me, too. How about we get a cappuccino. Oh, Steve, I don't know. Oh, come on, it's good for us. You want any sugar? - Uh, I'd rather have you. One last kiss, and then a crime of passion. What? - If I can't have you, then neither will the police. - Uh, two cappuccinos, please. - You promised after two months of seven-day-a-week bonding with your new job that we'd run away and lock the door... - I know. - On a cabin with an ocean view and no phone. Your time is up. - I know. I know it hasn't been easy for you. And I'll make it up to you, I promise. - Mm-hmm. Oh, things will in better in Portland. Quality of life, the great opportunities. Yada, yada, yada. And me, kicking and screaming that I was gonna hate it out here. Well, Steve, I do. But I love it when you kick and scream. And I love that. - You work twice as hard as you did in Chicago. But I am gonna give you another chance. - Yay. - Only because I'm savagely hungry for this body. Mm. - Honey, stop. Ellie, listen. This is a public place. Sit down. Occupy your mind with something else until tonight. - Okay, I'll drive myself crazy for the rest of the day. - Then I'll make you a surprise tonight. - Something besides food. You're a lousy cook. - Can I use food? - Yeah. That could have killed us. Learn to walk, buddy. That's assuming... Where'd you learn how to drive? You're kidding. Morning, Mrs. Kramer. - No, no. Get back here, damn it, listen. If you ever go to the police, so help me, I'll kill you. - No. Where do you think you're going? I'm going, I'm going to leave you. I told you to leave me alone. - We'll talk about this later. - I'm very sorry, Mrs. Kramer. I know it hasn't been easy for you, and I'll make it up to you, I promise. Oh, thing will be better in Portland. No, no. Get back here, damn it, listen. If you ever go to the police, so help me, I'll kill you. No. Where do you think you're going? I'm going, I'm going to leave you. Get off of me, leave me alone. We'll talk about this later. I'm very sorry, Mrs. Kramer. No, no. Come back are, damn it, listen. If you ever go to the police, so help me, I'll kill you. No. Where do you think you're going? I'm going, I'm going to leave you. Get off me, leave me alone. We'll talk about this later. I'm very sorry, Mrs. Kramer. No, no. Get back here, damn it, listen. If you ever go to the police, so help me, I'll kill you. No. Where do you think you're going? I'm going, I'm going to leave you. Get off me, leave me alone. We'll talk about this later. I'm very sorry Mrs. Kramer. - Good evening, Mr. Kramer. Hey, wait up. It's okay, take your time. - Nice turnout. - Yeah. If all across the street from the police headquarters, our response would be much quicker. - Soldini. Watch. - Fill us in. - Arthur Kramer. Lives up the block. Over there, number 808. Fat cat, judging from his wallet. - No robbery? - No robbery. - What, just for the hell of it then? - Looks like a straightforward crazy. - Who called the police? - This lady over here. She was walkin' her dog and found the body. - I wanna see the report, and I wanna talk to he before she goes home. You've got it. Please tell me again what happened, ma'am. - Dr. Wu. - Silk, Corbin. - What can you tell us? - Only that he was shot within the past hour. Probably a large caliber handgun. We'll have to find the bullet to be sure. - You saved me. - Oh, we're sorry. First date. - Ellie? Honey? Honey, what's the matter? - Well, I got off the bus, and I felt like someone was watching me. And then a block later I was sure I was being followed. God, it's just so much like that night when I was walking home in Chicago. - What night in Chicago? - Right before we left. - Why didn't you tell me about that. I just, I don't know why. You were on overload on that murder case. And I didn't want my imagination to be a problem Yeah, well, what if it wasn't your imagination. 9-1-1, police, fire, emergency. - Police, emergency. This is Captain Murtaugh, I'm at home. My wife is safe, but she was followed by a prowler. Yes, sir. Do you have a description? - She wasn't able to give one. I want all units in this area dispatched. If this guy's around, I want him found. I'm goin' out myself. Thank you. - Do you have to take care of this yourself? - You're my wife. I'll be back. Coming through. Watch your back, fellas. - Can we take him, Jake? - Yeah, you might as well. You don't see wackos with cannons around here much anymore. - Lieutenant, all units are broadcasting. They're callin' me over to Ninth and Hayes. All units? Pete, fun stuff. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down, man. What's up? I don't know, a prowler call at Ninth and Hayes, the only thing is, they got the whole world on it. - Well, let's get to it. Hang a left. There he is! - Son of a... Go back, go back, go back. Go back, go back. We got him, Jake, we got him, Jake. Freeze, police officers. Put your hands above your head. - Hold it right there. - Put your hands up. Interlock your fingers, lock 'em up. Dispatch, we're code four at 12th and Hayes. Suspect in custody, no current ID. - What you got there? You got a gun or somethin', huh? Well, what's this? What's this? - Captain Murtaugh. Thank you for your assistance. - Ooh, you chased the wrong woman tonight, man, huh. - Lt. Corbin and Sgt. Silk, I'll take it from here. Thank you, gentlemen. - Come on. - Sir. Hey, come on, come on. - I don't know every face on the force. But when a team has as many commendations as you two, I read the file. - Oh, I hope you didn't read the file too closely, captain. - Close enough to know you were the competition for my job, Corbin. Come on. - Yeah, nothin' unusual with this guy except he picked your wife, captain, and maybe somebody else who fought back. Look at the side of his head. - Ooh, what happened to you, hmm? - I got slapped with a gun, that's what happened. Look, man, I followed the lady, but I wasn't the only one. - You wanna tell me about your partner? - I ain't got no partner. There was somebody else watchin' us both. Come on, man, you can talk to me. I don't work duets, there was somebody else. - Oh, come on, don't tell me that. You were with somebody. - What did that somebody else look like? - I don't know, I didn't see him real clear. - Clear enough to see the gun. - I know what a gun feels like. I just saw the top of his head. He was somewhere around my height. You know, he was in the shadows. One big blur, and he was off. - Take him through it again. He's just a scavenger, sir. He'll get IDed from whoever gave him a hard time. - It could make a big difference to somebody else if there's another gun on the street. - He sees what he wants to see. - Captain, the joker who slammed me was not the competition. - What do you mean? - Well, he took me out and took off. A competition would've scored your old lady. - What was he then? - What am I, psychic? I don't know. - You finished, sir? - Yeah. It's just never enough when it's personal, that's all. Come on. Hey, let's not leave out any blanks on this one. It sounds like he'll cover the report himself. - Boy, do you got that right. - Get in there, and don't bump your head. Hey, I told you not to bump your head. - Great lover. Pretty good cook. Notoriously ambitious. And annoyingly overprotective. - Ellie. What made you think it was the same guy as the one that followed you in Chicago? - I didn't say it was the same guy. - But it sounded the same. - Just, every feeling was the same. Um, it felt like that night in Chicago, so it made me think of the same guy. Are you okay about this? - I love my wife, that's all. - That's all? - That's all. - You sure? - I'm sure. - Was there anything that happened in Chicago I should have known about or... - Honey, there was a creep who I was trying to find that took up all my time until we left for here. That's it. - That's it? - That's it. - Damn it, Steve, will you talk to me? I don't have to think very hard to remember how obsessed you were. Did you ever find that guy? - No, I... No, I didn't. I just hate to be reminded of that time in Chicago. - I'm sorry, Ellie, I am. - You take your job so seriously. You'll probably end up being police chief by the time you're 44. - I have a wonderful idea. Why don't you talk to the hospital, and have them move you to day shift? Then you can learn how to cook. - I know how to cook. - Mm-hmm. - Why don't you lay on the kitchen table, and I'll show you. - I'll tell you what. You lay in here, and I'll have the table sent up. Right this way, please. - I know you're a wonderful girl. Well, I am, I am, but... You agree with me. Gorgeous, beautiful party. Was it wonderful? Oh yes, all the time. - No, we could never be sure of them. You can never be sure of anything. Straighten your tie, Leon. - Jerry knows I hate this kind of place, hate it. Why do I have to wear a jacket and tie just to have my breakfast? He's just gonna wise off as usual about the business not making enough money. It isn't. He always has to make an entrance. That's why he's late. Jerry believes the business could be making a lot more money if you wouldn't battle him every step of the way. - It's our business now. All I did was ask him to lend me some money, not become the majority stockholder. What kind of person does a thing like that? More coffee, sir? You can't stand him anyway. Why are we doing this? Because he's your brother and your partner. Jerk, yes. Yes. He says he has a big surprise for all of us. Oh yeah. Oh, here they come. Maye. - Peg. - Leo. Hi, Maye. - Hi. - Gee, Jerry, we usually do our celebrating with coffee and donuts at the deli. - Well, that's your problem, Leon. Here is where you do real business. Jerry, you promised. - Look, Leon. Wald's Auto Parts has been in a rut for 10 years, all right. In a rut? We've been Manufacturer of the Year two years in a row. You call that a rut? Hey, we make the best muffler in the world for the least profit in the world. So? - United Auto Corporation wants to buy us out. It seems we fill a small niche in specialty parts. We're talking a fat deal, Leon. - I am not turning my business over to a company who can't even make a decent bumper. - But they can make a profitable bumper. That's crap. - So is your attitude about making money. - Listen, I built this business up from nothing, Jerry. I care about it, I care about the people that work there. And United Auto Corporation isn't going to care a anybody. And, and what am I supposed to do when they take over, huh? - Leo, they're not going to fire you. In fact, the managers stay on during the transition. You couldn't leave if you wanted to. - No. Look, it was my money that bailed you out of the hole. - Your money! - I'm majority stockholder. I told you , I told you. Your money, listen, let me tell you something. - Leon, you don't... All you care about is your wealth, Jerry. - You kill me about that. Why don't you become a social worker? Do you know how much money I'm gonna make for you on this? Is Mrs. Kramer in? - Well, I'm her mother. - I'm Mrs. Kramer. - Mrs. Kramer, we're Detectives Corbin and Silk. Thank you for seeing us. - Please, come in. Thank you, Lucy. You don't know who killed my husband, do you? - No, ma'am, we don't. Mrs. Kramer, there have been several suspected-abuse reports filed by your neighbors prior to your husband's murder. - It's no secret that we fought like hell. I should have left him years ago. - Why didn't you? - I've asked myself that question many times. - Mrs. Kramer, did your husband have any enemies that you knew about? Nobody that would do something like this. - Well, I mean, there must have been times like the other night you wished he was dead. - Am I a suspect? Of course I am. Yes, I wished he was dead, but only wished. - Where were you last night, about 11 o'clock? - I was having dinner with my mother. - Where? - Right next door at a friend of ours, Mildred Cable. She served poached salmon. - Thank you, Mrs. Kramer. If you think of anything, would you give us a call? - Mrs. Kramer, I've got one more thing. Had you been romantically involved with anybody during your marriage? - I thought about it, but no. - Well, had you thought about anybody in particular? - I was always faithful to my husband, even though I hated my life. - Thank you for your time. - Lucy will see you out. - Thank you. She could have hired somebody to kill him. - I doubt she has those connections. - Nah, a lady like that's smart. You want the connection, you find the connection. - I believe her. - Yeah, well, I think I'm gonna find out what Mildred Cable had for dinner last night. - Ma'am. - My condolences, Mrs. Kramer. - Thank you, Joe. Any mail? - Yes, your mail. - Two super-clean 380s. Now, the Harkins evidence came out of Chicago. What's a Chicago case comin' here for? - Well, it usually doesn't. But this Kramer killing was interesting, so I ran the specifics through the FBI down in Quantico. I put a rush on it. And they came back with a possible match, Harkins in Chicago. So I called the Chicago DA, and presto, the evidence appears. My, you've been a busy little techie. - I do my best. - So, we get lucky or what? - Maybe. Every time a bullet fires, it's like a miniature eruption. Eventually, the barrel is impregnated with heat checks. Carbon fills the craters. I'd guess both guns are 10 years old. But there's a problem. See this strange line? It's not the sort from a gun-cleaning brush, but almost as if some kind of abrasive metal, like a file, was used on the inside of the barrel. And it's only on one bullet. - So are you saying that someone altered the barrel, but they're both the same gun? - Different lines means no match. Pretty smart, huh? But unfortunately for our boy, he forgot something. In both crimes, we found the shell casing. - So? - So, during firing, the casing slams back into the gun vault, leaving marks that can be matched just as accurately as a slug. I am pretty damn sure that the gun that killed Harkins in Chicago is the same one that killed Kramer here. Mrs. Kramer, I recently sent you a bill. Who are you? You may call me Alex. Do you understand the terms? You've made it quite clear. But why should I pay you? I, I could just go to the police. - I wouldn't do that if I were you. The police will think you hired the killer. I've linked you to Arthur's murder. Actually, you're the only one with anything to gain from this crime. You're their chief suspect. - But I would, I would never murder Arthur. - Sally, you're safe now. You're safer now than you've been in a long time. Don't be a fool and make your life miserable again. Now, let's discuss how you'll get the money. Let me suggest to three of your husband's accounts. The Capital account, the First Savings, and the Premier Federal account. Your husband had quite a stash. Draw the money from those accounts, no bills larger than 100. Put them in a brown paper bag. And I'll call you tomorrow and tell you where to drop them off. Thanks. Thanks. Now, just screw the cap on, and it'll work fine. What's this for? Here, boy, go get it. Go! Race ya. Ready? Wait. Frank, over here. Yes, sir. We got the information from. Yes, he's definitely in trafficking. - Problem? - No, no problem. I wanted to personally give you the report of the scavenger who followed your wife. - Stickin' to his story? - Yep, all zeroes. Just a street cowboy like we thought. You know, when you were questioning him, I got the feeling you were onto something. - No, no, no, no. Corbin was just sloppy. He already had his mind made up about the guy. - Corbin is as good as they come, captain. - Good enough for my job? - You know, it's hard when they get somebody from the outside, especially from the big city. - Where is Corbin anyway? - Uh, he's on his way to Chicago. We got a maybe out of ballistics on the Kramer shoot-down. - A maybe what? - Well, the same weapon may have been used on a woman there by the name of Harkins. Possibly a professional job. Miss Wilkins to housekeeping. Miss Wilkins to housekeeping, please. - Sgt. Decker, I'm sure you remember Rebecca. We were married this year. - Congratulations, Mrs. Harkins. - Thank you. - This is Detective Corbin from Portland. - Thank you both for seeing me on such short notice. Sir, we have reason to believe that the gun used to kill your former wife may have been involved recently in a murder in Portland. - What does that have to do with me? - There may be a professional killer involved. - Are you telling me that I'm still a suspect in Maria's death? - A long as the case is unsolved, I'm afraid so. - For a year now, you've been tormenting me with your accusations. It's not easy for me these days. I won't submit to anymore harrass... They say I've got two months left. For the last time, I often wished my ex-wife dead, but I didn't hire anybody to kill her. - Oddly enough, sir, the circumstances of the murder in Portland are very similar to this case, only there it was a wife who wished her husband dead. And we're very concerned, there's a likelihood there will be more victims. - It was a professional killer. No, dear. - James is only trying to protect me. But I don't want anybody else to have to go through this. - The guy killed my wife on his own and sent me the bill. I couldn't believe it, so I didn't think about the money until he called. You can't believe it either. - Does this killer have a name? - Yes. Alex. - Mr. Harkins, do you have this bill that he sent you? - No. I got rid of it afterwards. I tore it up into small pieces and flushed it down the toilet after I paid him. - How much did you pay for these services? - $100,000. - I have never heard the name Alex before, and I don't like what you're suggesting. - Mrs. Kramer, will you listen to us. Your alibi checks out. - I buried my husband yesterday. I have nothing to do with his death. And as far as I'm concerned, it's over. - Would you mind tellin' us then why you visited your safe deposit boxes yesterday? - It was papers for my attorney. I mean, is that a crime? I grieved for the last five years of my marriage. That same morning, I, I went grocery shopping, and I bought a new dress. Is there anything else? - That's all. For now. - Good night, gentlemen. - She's hidin' somethin'. - Okay, well, maybe you're right. But what does that have to do with Murtaugh? - I'm not sure yet. But Sgt. Decker told me Murtaugh ran the Harkin case in Chicago. I know Harkin and Kramer are tied. Why didn't he mention it? - Hello? Why were the police visiting you? - How do you know? - What did they want? - They, um, they found out about a murder in Chicago. They said that, that you did it, that you'd used the same gun to murder Arthur. - What else did they tell you? I don't remember. - Think! - A man named, I believe, Harkin told them about a note you sent. He's dying of cancer. I can't go on like this. - Mrs. Kramer, you have nothing to worry about as long as you do what you're told. Did you destroy my bill? - Yes. - You just have to stick to your story. Don't break the bond. - Hello. - I was being followed as soon as I left the hospital the last two nights, by the police, I presume. - Yes. - If you've got a problem, tell me. And that would be good enough for me. Because in case you haven't noticed, you're driving me crazy. - There's problem. It's a precaution, Ellie. Tell me you're not afraid. - I'm afraid, yes, but that's my problem. I haven't seen you like this since we left Chicago. I just wanna cut out the paranoia, okay. Is there something you're not telling me? - No. Leon, telephone. - You better get over over there. - Mike, remember to place two more loads in the back before you finish. Yes, sir. I'll go get another one. Yeah. All they want us for is the damn parking lot, Jerry, not a better bumper. They just wanna get rid of the competition. - Look, please, do me a favor, let's go talk in the office, okay. - Wait a minute. - Why? - You don't want all these people to hear they may not have jobs? - This hole-in-the-wall's gonna pay you a jackpot because of me. - A jackpot? - Leon. - I don't want a jackpot! I wanna run my own business. - Come on, Maye, please, talk some sense into him. Where does this deal stand? - I turn in the papers in a couple of days. You know somethin', brother of mine? You're damn lucky. - I'm lucky? Lucky? You hear that, everybody, huh? I trust brother, and he takes over my whole business. Jerry, I'll buy you out. - No, Harkins is tellin' the truth, I'm sure of it. And we gotta do somethin' to follow up on this Kramer case. - You pushed the lady hard enough. - We're conductin' a routine investigation. Damn it, Harkins even tells his bride. I mean, why's a dying man gonna lie? - What kind of medication is he on? - What? - One, heavy medication can cause delusions. Two, if there was a killer, whether he hired him or not, you don't have a description. And three, Harkins was heavy gambler. He cashed checks like that all the time. - You know, I don't get it, captain. Why didn't you ever mention you were involved with the Harkins case? - I was involved in a lot of cases in Chicago. I want you two to report to Vance and Fields on the slasher case. You'll be my homicide liaison team. I also checked ballistics reports. It won't hold up. Here, you go, dear. Oh, thanks a lot. This is all of it? - Yep. Yeah, I mean, that's all I got here. No problem, thanks a lot. - Hey, it's his call. - Yeah, I know, but after what that Sgt. Back in Chicago about the captain's involvement in the Harkins case, how the hell can he keep it from us? - Look, he's pushed his pencil through every report and come to a conclusion we don't like. Now, what's wrong with that? - Everything. He's backin' us off because we're hot. The only thing that made sense in that meeting were the things that shouldn't. What's wrong is you're not captain. - What's wrong is the captain. He ain't playin' this straight. - Whoa, Jake. Look, now, I mean, you're a good cop. But I'm not willing to lose my pension on one of your damn hunches, now, you got that? What was the time of the arrival? Hello. Hello. Is anybody in there? - Mr. Wald. Jerry. - I'm Lori Halliwell. I spoke with you this morning. - At what time were you supposed to meet me? - I'm sorry, but... - Time is money, doll. Did you come up with an assessment schedule? Not yet, but... What about the blueprints? Here. Sweetheart, these are incomplete. I brought the key. - No one important was paying any attention to these buildings at all until I figured out how to joint venture the rehab. Now, even though Uncle Seth closed off most of my leverage in that stupid '86 tax reform, I can still, still offer a four to one shelter. Understand? The secret is in finding structurally sound space. That's why I always look it over myself before the engineers. And I like to start at the top. So which way to the roof? - The roof? - There now, you see. Someone did a lousy patch job. What's that? - That's my boss, Mr. Eaton. He said he'd call with the figures you needed. - Well, go and call him back. I have to check on how you gun-ups are gonna cheat me anyhow. - Jerry. A lot of people get hurt in elevators, Jerry. - What is this? Some kind of joke? - It's no joke, Jer. - My hot-shot lawyer, Howard, says that as long as Jerry is the majority stockholder, I can't stop the sale. - Peg says you're just making matters worse for everyone. - I feel like my work, my life is over, Maye. What am I gonna do when the new owners kiss me off without a sorry? - Maybe it's not as bad as you think. - Believe me, I'm as good as gone. - Then we'll run away to one of those exotic islands in the brochures I've been bringing home for the last 10 years. It's gonna work out, like it always does. - Yeah. Can you tell me what happened? Don't move your hand. - I went to make a call to my boss. I went to get some figures for Mr. Wald. And I got back into the elevator. And I looked up. And... 45 years, he always gave good bonuses. up, guys. Yeah. Okay, did you see anybody enter the building? Well, he won't be feelin' no pain. Did they have anybody? Dr. Lafferty, line 118, please. Dr. Lafferty, line 118. - Ellie's in the NICU. - Thanks. - Sure. He's got your nose, honey. - He looks real cute, doesn't he? - Yeah. - Real good. - May I help you? Nice selection, huh? Minimum wait is nine months. Would you like to place an order? - What kind would you like? - Oh, I'm not particular. I like surprises. Sorry I'm late. - It's okay, just another late dinner. - I say we skip dinner. Dr. Bartlett, please call the operator. Dr. Bartlett, call the operator. You have some terrible knots. I know. Oh yes, right there. Right there. Right there? No, not there. If you get that, I'm giving up on you. - Okay. Oh shoot. - Uh, I am entitled, and you're entitled, to a hot bath and no phone. - I know. There is. And persistence must be rewarded. I'll be back, I promise, before your suds disappear. Hello. - Hi, how are ya. It is you, isn't it. - Yeah, it's me. You know, you were a very bad boy running away like that. I spent the better part of a month locating you and your simpler, less stressful life. My heart bleeds for ya. How did you find me anyway? - I wish you had consulted me on this move. I would have preferred a larger city, a place that would give me more opportunity. - You killed Kramer, didn't you? No comment. How many does that make now? How long you gonna keep up this insanity? - How's Ellie? I really miss her. You know, we're all in this together, Steve. I'm as married to you as she is. So please don't ever leave me again. If you don't get off that phone, our marriage is goin' down the drain. - Uh-oh. Maybe I should let you get back to your bath? - Where are you, you bastard? You're not gonna get away with this forever. - You were a lot more respectful in Chicago. - I think it's time we had a meeting in person. Just you and me, face to face. - I don't think that's necessary. You're always in my thoughts, in my dreams. - It's necessary. - You should learn to relax, Steve. Everything's gonna be all right, I promise you. Incidentally, there was a terrible accident this evening. A man fell down an elevator shaft, very messy. Steve, come on, hun. - Maybe I should call you at work. I sense that you have something more pressing on your mind. - What's wrong? - Ellie, I didn't leave Chicago and come here to Portland because of the opportunity. I left Chicago because I was afraid you were gonna be the next victim of the killer I was lookin' for. - Me? Why? - Because Alex told me that... - Who? - Alex is, is a name he uses. And he said that if I didn't stop you investigation of him that he was gonna kill you. Did the department know about this? - Yes. - Why didn't you tell me? - It was bad enough that I had to go through it. When this job came up, I felt the best thing I could do for the both of us was to just get out of Chicago. That was Alex on the phone, wasn't it? Yes. Well, what did he say? He said that he just killed somebody else. Oh my god. - Did he betray the trust? Steve, hold me. - He broke the bond. It's exactly like Jerry. It's not your right... - Jerry sure left her enough money to make sure she finds herself another sucker. At least I got the first option on his shares. - Leon, he was your brother. - And I loved him. I just couldn't stand him. Oh, look, I'm a relatively civilized person, so I'm not proud of the way I feel. But I got two dozen employees who think he got what was coming. Leon, telephone. - Okay, I'll get it. - Hello. Mr. Wald, my name is Alex. I recently sent you a bill. A bill for what? For your brother, Leon, for Jerry. What's this got to do with my brother? - Leon, I took care of your problem. I executed Jerry. Are you crazy? Who is this? - The police won't think I'm crazy when I tell them you hired me for the job. Hey, listen, uh, um, I don't have that kind of money. I mean, I... - Leon, I performed a service. You benefited directly from that service. I expect to be remunerated. - Hey, listen, you know what, I'll go to the police. - I'm afraid they won't believe you. Leon, the same fate that befell Jerry could just as easily fall on Maye. - Maye. I'm gonna have to, I have to borrow $25,000 from your father. - Why? - I can tell you that. I know that's unreasonable. I mean, I know that. - What is it, Leon? - Maye, please. Don't make this any harder than it is, okay. This thing came up. And I'm all tapped out. - Well, what happens if you don't get the money? - Then you're going to be going to my funeral. - Somebody threatened your life? Well, you have to go to the police. - No, no, no, no. The police can't know anything about this. Please, Maye. I've already told you more than I should. - What have you done, Leon? - Nothing. I haven't done anything, nothing. But I'm scared, Maye. I'm scared of what this man might do. He's dangerous. He's dangerous in a way that you can't even imagine. He might kill me. He might kill somebody close to me. You're the only one that's close to me. - Well, all the more reason you have to go to the police. - No, no, no, I can't do that. - Hello. Captain, it's Alex. 11 tonight, Washburn Street. - What number on Washburn? Any number, Murtaugh. Really good. Put more wood that fire. Hey man, let me have a taste. - Watch where you're goin'. How's about a kiss, love? Have you noticed how ambitious men are always on time? Come on, captain, you can get out. We have to be able to trust each other, don't we? - Come on, Alex, I never trusted you. You're upset. Hey, I haven't lost faith in you. - Then why don't you put your little toy down, come on out where I can see you. Come on, Alex. Come out and show me what you're really made of. 'Cause I think you're like a little boy that hides under the bed. If I were hidin' under your bed, I'd be up all night with the oohs and the ahhs, wouldn't I? - Why keep hiding, Alex. I thought we were gonna meet face to face. I've always looked at our arrangement as being mutually beneficial. I did the work, you got what you wanted. I don't think I asked for much, do you? - Killing is real easy for you, isn't it? I'm paid well for my services. My calling in life is righting wrongs, eliminating suffering. - You're the one that should die! I had no idea how angry you were. I'm truly sorry about that. - Why are you following my wife? I wanted to be clever in announcing my return. I let her know she was being followed. I expected her to let you know. But along came this unsavory fellow. I'm very protective of lovely girls, especially your darling Ellie. Don't say her name! A little nervous, aren't we? You're not trying to kill me, are you? You can't shoot at something you can't see, see, see. Stop looking around, Murtaugh. I'm everywhere. It's an echo synthesizer. I could be a block away or a few feet away. I hate to see you lose control. It reminds me of Chicago when I helped you with Sarah. - Killing Sarah was your idea, not mine. And Kramer was your idea too, wasn't he? You breached our special relationship by discussing me with Ellie. You broke the bond. Now it's Ellie's turn. - No! Good night, captain. Buff it out, buff it out. Buff out them scratches. Yeah, I got it. some bubbles here. Must be some score in the north dock press machine. I'll check it out. It's the first of those last ones. Leon, telephone. The other side, the other side. - Leon speaking. Yeah, yeah, um, I raised the money, but am I correct in assuming... - I can't hear you. I've raised the money, and I just wanna know, is this, is this gonna be payment in full? - Absolutely, Leon. One service, one payment. - How did, how did you find out about Jerry and me? I mean, why me? - You picked me, Leon. - What are you talking about? I don't even know you. How could I pick you? - You've been asking for help for a long time. Not that way. There was no other way, and you had nothing to do with it. - Listen, somebody had to tell you about me, damn it, somebody. Leon, I want you to put the money in a brief case. At 11:15, starting at the traffic light on Wilcox, I want you to walk south side of Mapes Boulevard, toward Grand. At some point, a car trunk will pop open. I want you to put the brief case in the trunk, close the lid, and continue on toward Grand. Don't bother trying to get the license number, the car has been rented. - Thanks, see you later, Jimmy. Steve, what... Corbin and Silk, ma'am. - I told Leon that I wasn't feeling well, so he told me to stay home. I didn't call you to get my husband into trouble, but I'm afraid for both of us. I mean, my husband may have done something really terrible. He was at the end of his rope when he asked for all that money. - I never ordered my brother's killing. This guy did it on his own. On his own? - He even sent me a bill. For $100,000? - Yeah. And I didn't believe that, and all of a sudden he calls me, and he says I owe him the money. - Does this guy have a name? - Alex. And he gave me some time to get the money together. And then he called again with instructions, what I'm supposed to do with the money. $100,000, put it in the trunk of a car on, um, Mapes Boulevard. - Alex, did you see him? - No, we've only spoken on the phone. - How many times? - Twice. - Mr. Wald, why didn't you call the police? - I wanted to, but he said that if I did that, then he was gonna say that I hired him. And then he threatened to kill my wife. Did you ever get a bill from a murderer? - Say, you wouldn't happen to have this bill, would ya? - Oh yeah, oh yeah. - Whoa-ho-ho, Silky. - Oh, he's dead meat. Dr. Metzer, line 342, please. Dr. Metzer, please call line 342. - Good evening. You know, Steve, you can tell a lot about people by the way they breathe into a phone, their hopes, their dreams. Why don't you help me out, Alex. Are you starting to panic a little? - Actually, I'm enjoying our little game. When the stakes are high, so am I. - I'd say it was pretty careless of you to risk a meeting with me. - I'd prefer exciting. It demonstrates how inept you really are. Well, then give us a kiss, love. You know, I don't recall Ellie ever having taken the bus to work with another nurse. Was her chaperone a policewoman? A halting breath. Unhealthy, but it helps control the anger. Sound is so extraordinary. You're upset because you couldn't kill me the other night, aren't you? Well, I'm upset, too. I'm afraid that the trust I so valued in our relationship is in jeopardy. I always knew the most intimate details in your life. And now I'm afraid you'll go out of your way to deceieve me. - Count on it. - You're so good, and I'm so bad. Are you as good a boy as Ellie thinks? - You leave her out of this. - If you hadn't told her about us, if you hadn't broken the bond, she wouldn't be in it, would she? - We're walkin' on ice if we don't go to Murtaugh with the Alex letter. - Maybe Murtaugh's walkin' on ice, damn thin ice. - A dirty cop? - Look, he's Mr. Gung-Ho Teamwork on every case except this one. Now, you think about it. Corbin. I love you, did I ever tell you that? I love you. Gilbert's got a story on the stationary Alex used. Here's your files. Thank you, Byron. It's on this list? It should be. - The only clear prints are those of Leon Wald. Now, the paper's distinctive. 20-pound weight, woven fiber, hand-brushed, cockle-finished. Now, expensive stuff like this always has a watermark. This one was registered. Documents section identified the manufacturer as De Schulte's Papers in Switzerland. How can you eat that? That's lethal. - Have you called 'em yet? - Yep, now, here's where we hit a bit of luck. It seems there's only one store in the whole US that sells it, and that's Yarboro Stationers in Chicago. - There much call for it? - Not a whole lot, especially in the blue shade. They had seven orders in the last year. Three of them went to New York, two of them went to Chicago, and one to Dallas, Texas. - You gettin' smart on us, Gilbert? That's six, what about the seventh? - To a Mr. Belmont at the Pardee Club, here in dear old Portland. - Let's get outta here. - Let's go. - You're right about these things, especially if they're a day old. - Oh, thank you. - Well, now, the package was sent from the Yarboro Stationers to Gerald Belmont at the Pardee Club, Mr. Hartman. - Well, all deliveries are registered. It would be easy to check. You say it was mailed out about three weeks ago? - That's right. - You've got quite an arsenal here, Mr. Hartman. Who's your collector? - We all are, detective. After all, Pardee is Portland's oldest gun club. I remember now. Mr. Brandt said that a package would be coming for a friend, Mr. Belmont. - When did Belmont pick up the package? - Oh, he didn't. Well, then the package is still here? No, Mr. Brandt collected it. - Who's Mr. Brandt? - Mr. Brandt is our most recent member, a transfer. - Transfer, from where? - The Bridgestone Club in Chicago. - Do you happen to have Mr. Brandt's Portland address? - Oh, of course. I'll get out his application. - Hey Jake, you think Brandt and Belmont just might be the same guy? - I would bet my life on it. Muah! - Eh! - Hey, Silk. Good luck. Let's see what we got. Police! Search warrant! - Let's go! - Move! Somebody in here. - There it is. - I'm goin' around back. Nothin' over here. - Silk. Right here. Through the doors. Ready. - Go. - What the hell? Quality construction. - Hey, gimme that thing. Are the rooms clear? Yes, sir. Look out. - Steel? - Man, this dude is living in a vault. Yeah, this is Silk. I'm gonna need a torch up here, man. - Come on, guys, come on, come on. A little elbow grease, let's get it open. Come on. Tag this, all this stuff. - Murtaugh. Pete. - Yeah? - Come here. What you got? - I got a lot of bad answers here, that's what I got. Gentlemen, you all have copies of the extortion notes. Yes, yes. - What's he doin' here? Captain Murtaugh informed us of his dilemma two months ago when he arrived here. - What dilemma? - Come in, sit down. I was a candidate of Alex's. - Why the hell were we kept in the dark? - Because I was afraid to take a chance. Alex knew every move that I made. If he even suspected that I was helping you with your investigation, he'd kill me wife. - Alex surveys a conflict between two people he doesn't even know and dispassionately picks one to champion, and then coolly destroys the other. - The question on the table now is, what do we do about it? - I think we should go public with the story, all of it. - The man is unstable. We have no idea of how he'll react. - It'll force him to move. - As I see it, your wife will be the target. - We'll take Ellie out of the equation, hide her some place that Alex can't find her. Then he won't have a choice. He'll have to move, and his only target'll be me. - It's too risky, Steve. - Frank, I've got to. I don't know what was the matter with me, honey. It happened about a month before we hot married. I was in Chicago, and you were gone two weeks at that nurses conference. We were havin' Lt. Carter's bachelor party. I had too much to drink. There she was. It was a stupid mistake. - How long did it go on? - Just a few days, it meant nothing. - I've always trusted you. I don't know what to think now. - Ellie, I love you. Don't do this to me. - Don't do this to you? That's funny. - I told her I never wanted to see her again, but it didn't stop her. She'd keep comin' by after work and callin' on the phone. She was gettin' crazy. She wouldn't go away no matter what. I couldn't stand it anymore. - Don't keep telling me what kind of pain you were in. You're a liar. - I was afraid. You, afraid. - Alex killed her. He set me up, and he took advantage of me because of the way I compromised myself. And his fee was his freedom. - He was the one who followed me? - Yes. I felt if maybe I had more time, I could get him, but I had to play by his rules. Ellie, he was gonna kill you. I wanted to tell you about her a thousand times. - Stop the car. - Ellie. - Stop the car! - Ellie! Ellie. Ellie. - Leave me alone, Steve. I can't be around you right now. Hey, you all right? Your attention, please, your attention, please. Visiting hours are now over. - Is the nursery down this way? - Right there. - Thank you. Attention, please, visiting hours now over. Can she have solid foods? - Mrs. Anderson? Sure. - Hi, it's Ellie. Sgt. Silk just arrived. - Describe him to me. - Uh, 6'1", black. - It's okay. - Where am I going? - I don't know. They'll tell me later. Ellie? I love you. - I'll talk to you later. - How's it goin', Dave? - One minute is all we need. - Yeah, well, he knows that. - You saw his stuff. You can't set up that kind of rid overnight. He'd need a bank of phones to do anything. - What if he scrambles? - We can unscramble in three seconds. If he calls, we'll find him. - Believe me, Dave, he'll call. Here we go. Oh, thanks. - Hello? - Hello. I hate to admit it, but I've had a terrible day. - Well, it's gonna get worse. - What do you mean worse? Worse for who? I'm still in the driver's seat, lover boy. You have made my life extremely uncomfortable. Now I have to figure out how to even the score. - And what did you have in mind? - Do you really think that my clients only pay me because they're intimidated? They love the fact that someone will step in and do their dirty work for them. You loved it. But you never paid. You're not a very good boy. - Ah, let me guess. This is the point where you're gonna threaten me, right? - Actually, I wasn't even thinking of you. I was thinking of a bubble bath. I was thinking of Ellie. All right, saddle up, let's move it. Yeah, we got a positive ID on the victim. Name is Leon Wald. Yeah, right, Wald Auto. We don't need to call anyone else in. They're police. Stand back. We're gonna move right through here. Yeah, we're ready. I'll run the plates on right down. Good evening, Benson Hotel. - 328. Hello? - Ellie. Is everything all right there? Well, just sit tight, and try not to worry, okay. Remember, the important thing is, don't open the door for anyone. You understand? Everything will be okay. That's easy for you to say. I hope you're right, Steve. Yeah, I need a check, okay, on three. Manager needed on three. Wow, Billy , check it out. - Huh? Look at this. Wow, cool. Where'd you get it? Cashier. Manny, come over here, you. We're in trouble. Hank, customer needs help, carry out. I need some change. Hello? - Ellie, has Sgt. Silk given you the gun yet? Yeah, it's in the drawer in the nightstand. - Everything okay? Just remember, if anybody enters the room, all you have to do is point it and fire. It's a .44 Magnum, it'll stop a horse. - You really think he'd try and get me here? We have to take every precaution, honey. The man's insane. - I'm scared, Steve. I wanna be there with you, but I can't take a chance I'll be followed. - Bye. Room service. Room service, this is 328. I'd like a couple of burgers. One with cheese, rare, and a beer and a soda. Yes, sir, that'll be about 15 minutes. Let's take a look at what's happening locally here. - Hello. - Murtaugh, I expected as much. What a silly thing to do. But not to worry, I have everything under control. What are you talkin' about? - You know, you can't spend the rest of your life protecting Ellie. It'll put a terrible strain on your marriage. - Steve, I'm so scared. - Alex! - Steve, you gotta learn to relax. Learn to conserve your energy. You're gonna need it. If you hurt her, I'll kill you. - A Magnum is a savage weapon, you said. Alex! - Just point it and shoot. - Alex! - It'll stop a horse, you said. Captain. - Where's she at? Two doors down, sir, on the right. - Hi, Mike. What's the situation? - Sir, it's very quiet in there. That's all we know. Okay, Mike. - Go! - Police! - Hey! - Ellie! - Pete! - Hurry! - Get an ambulance here, now! - It's all right. - But he knew, he knew, he heard you call me here. - It's all right, it's all right. It's all right. - Why didn't he kill me? - It's all right. He's just playin' with us. It's me he wants, it's just me. It's just me, just me,. Pete. - Owe you one, Chris. Thanks, Mike. - I just wanna go home, Steve. Take me home. It's all clear. We'll never be safe here. He'll be back. He'll always be out there, tomorrow, a year from now, watching, listening. I wanna get out of this city. You can't protect me forever. I'll get it. Steve, this isn't Alex. This, this isn't Alex. Look out! Oh, I don't. Those pancakes Nevermind, nevermind. Okay, there's three, four, five. - Warmup on this coffee, hon? Thanks. - Honey, are you all right? I think so. - You promise? - Steven, where are you going? - He's watching. He's out there somewhere watching. - Steven! You don't even know what he looks like! - Police officer. Put your hands on the table. - Hmm, what? - I said, put your hands on the table! All right! - Don't try anything. Just keep your hands on the table. You, sit down! - Get off me. - Shut up. Okay, hands out to the side. - Get off me. - Shut up! , the power's out. What's your name? I said, what's your name? All right. Hands straight up, ID, tell me where it is. - Right pocket, man. - Steve, Steve. - Okay, hands up. - Easy, man. All right, gimme some ID. - Steve, he's not the one. Steve! - How about a kiss, love? Alex, don't!
