- But that beating last night was like all the rest. Three of our employees in the past month. There must be a way to stop this, Lieutenant. - We can catch the goons in the act, Mr. Rennick, or a victim could identify his assailant. - The goons are only hired help. I'm talking about getting the loan sharks themselves. - Until your man Baski is able to talk, we're not even sure his beating's connected with the others. - Of course it is. The poor fellow was trying to get out of town, run away from them. - Come in. Oh, Thompson. Lieutenant White from police headquarters. Thompson's Baski's section boss. - Thompson. - Lieutenant. - Thompson, do you happen to know if Baski was in debt to the loan sharks? - I couldn't say Mr. Rennick. I try and talk the boys out of borrowing. But I couldn't say about Baski. - Does he hang around that saloon across the street? - Well, he's usually in for a beer after work. - Ever see him gambling in the back room over there? - Lieutenant, I don't like to make trouble for anybody. - Okay, Thompson, that's all I wanted. Thanks. - Hey, Charlie. Hear anything more about Baski, Charlie? - Just what the papers said. Internal injuries and a possible skull fracture. - Boy, they sure gave him a going over. - Well, it's crazy to try and run. When they gotcha, it's smarter to pay. - Big mistake Baski made was opening his yap around here yesterday afternoon. - What do you mean, Ed? - I mean some rat in this section tipped off Donelli that Baski was leaving town. - Sure, how else did they find out? - Well, they're not scaring me. I'm three weeks behind on my payments, but I told 'em to go whistle. I'll pay 'em when I can. - If you guys had my luck in the back room, you wouldn't be going into hock. - The way my luck's been running, I'm ready to throw that back room up for keeps. - Well, meet me over there tonight, fella, and I'll show you how it's done. - I haven't gotten time for even a beer tonight. My brother-in-law's coming into town and I got to get home. - Hmm. - Aww, but I wanted to stay home and watch television! - Television! I look at those four walls all day. One of these nights I'll wrap that television right around your ears! - Joe? Oh, Joe! Oh, Joe, Joe! - Take it easy, Marty. Take it easy. Everything's okay now. Let me take a look at you. Well, Martha Gargen's a grown girl. - Three years, Joe. Three years since we've seen each other. - Yeah, but you don't look like my kid sister anymore. - Let me look at you. Oh, you're so pale, Joe. - Well, they ran short of sunlamps up there. - Oh, I nearly died thinking about you in that... Oh, you didn't belong there. Anybody can get in a fight, it was an accident. - Yeah, sure. A two year, nine month accident. Now, tell me about this Haines guy. How's he been treating you? - Oh, Ed's fine and treating me fine. - Good. - Oh, Joe! Where in heaven did you get this horse hair sack? - Lady, I want you to know I helped make this suit. - Well, you can help burn it. Have you got a decent one? - In my bag. - Well, the first thing you're going to do is soak in a hot tub and then-- - Still bossing me around, huh? - And I'm way out of practice. - Well, let's get one thing straight, Marty. I'm only staying here until I can find a place of my own. - Sure, sure. We'll talk about it later. Ed'll be home in a few minutes, but you take-- May I come in? - 'Course. Come on over and sit down a minute. - Before I started supper, I thought I'd run in and tell you that... - Oh, Joe, this is Ann Nelson. My brother, Joe Gargen. - Hiya. - Hello. - Ann's our neighbor. She lives downstairs. - Glad to meet you. - I could see you making up your mind. - Uh, did you talk to him, Ann? - Yes, he said he'd like to see your brother in the morning. - Who does? - Uh, Joe, I told Ann about you. She works for Mr. Rennick, the general manager at Ed's tire plant and, well, she asked him about a job for you. - And you didn't get fired? - He seemed to be quite interested in you. I've got to run along now. See you later. - Thanks, Ann. - Marty, I told you I didn't want anybody-- - I only told her so she could ask him about a job for you. Besides, she's like one of the family. - Nice family. - Into the tub with you now. You can even use my bubble bath. - That's something I really did miss. - Well, what I still don't get through my head is-- - Which one? - Is the business of assault with a deadly weapon 'cause you punch a guy. - I once fought professionally. That makes my fist a weapon, as far as the law is concerned. - Dessert's not very fancy tonight. - Why didn't you make 'em black? - Black? - All day long at the plant, I cook tires. I come home and what does my wife serve me? Little tires. - I made them for Joe. Mom used to do it when we were kids. - We'll be lucky if they don't taste like tires. - Mm! Synthetic rubber. - A couple of comedians, you-- - What's the matter, Netta? - It's Steve! - Martha. What happened, Steve? - The money men. It was my turn. Those dirty butchers! We've got to do something about this. - I know what I'm doing. Netta and me are leaving town. I didn't figure you for a guy that runs, Steve. - This time they beat me. Next time it might be Netta. - Oh, this is Marty's brother, Joe Gargen. Steve Casmer. - Hello, Steve. - Hi. - What is this routine about money men? - Loan sharks. They got half the guys at the plant on the hook. - Yeah, you get behind the interest payments and this is what happens to you. - All you guys have got jobs. What do you go to those fellows for? - Some of us get in the hole gambling. Some guys got bills to pay. A lot of reasons, Joe. - Why don't you go to banks or legal loan companies? - They want collateral, credit references. We're bum risks for legit outfits. - We've been chumps, Steve. It's time we started hitting back. - Yeah, like how? - Like getting a bunch of guys together and going to the cops. We can prove we've been paying illegal interests, that guys have been beaten up. We can make some kind of charge stick. - You can't get enough guys to do it. - I'll get 'em. And you'll be our proof, you and Baski. How about it, Steve? - Well... You get the others, I'll string along. - Now you're talking. We'll get Netta to put some ice packs on your face. You'll be okay. - Cooking tires all day must have softened your brain, pal. - What do you mean? - Well, you can't beat the kinda guys that run the loan shark rackets. The idea is to pay off and stay away from them. - We've paid 'em plenty. They've been getting away with everything but murder. - And that's what'll happen to you next if you go ahead with that crazy idea of yours. Ed, my sister's too young to be a widow. - Look, Joe, you're a nice guy, but don't try and run my life and I won't try and run yours. - Okay. If that's the way you want it. Hello, there. - Hiya. What are you doing out here? - Thinking. Waiting. For a cigarette. - Thanks. Fine first night reception you ran into, wasn't it? - Come again? - Steve Casmer, the beating up business. - You mean it should make me feel right at home? - Of course not. Get the chip off your shoulder. - I'm sorry. I'm used to talking to a lotta mugs like myself. It's been a long time since I met a girl in your class. - You're no mug. You're letting that prison term give you an inferiority complex. - Marty tell you why I was in prison? - She told me you got in a fight, you knocked a man down. His head hit something, he almost died. - Well, now you know the kinda guy I am. - Yep. Quick-tempered. And I'm not a bit scared. It's getting late. I think I better go in. - This Mr. Rennick I'm gonna see tomorrow, you know him well? - I'm his secretary. I'll see you there in the morning. You better go. Oh, Paul, I'm so glad you're home. Good morning. - Hiya. - Joe Gargen here to see you, Mr. Rennick. Yes, sir. He'll be free in a minute. - Oh, I'm sorry about last night. - Forget it. I have. - I just want you to know I don't go around making passes at married women. - Don't you? And I just want you to know that I'm not a married woman. - Not married? Then who was that guy that-- - My brother, Paul. He lives with me. Paul works here at the plant. He's really a very nice guy. And keep your eyes and ears open, Charlie. - Okay, Mr. Rennick. - Come in, please. No calls for a few minutes, Ann. - Yes. - Glad to meet you. - Likewise. - This is Mr. Howell, the union representative. Joe Gargen. - How are you, Gargen? - Hiya, Mr. Howell. - Sit down, Gargen. Ann has told me all about you. - Oh. - Where you came from, the work you've done. It fits what I've got in mind. - I don't follow you. - You came from a tough neighborhood. Then you knocked around the country at different jobs. Truck driver, boss of a railway section gang, bouncer at a bar, manager of a gambling club at Las Vegas. - There's nothing much you don't know, except about my last job for the state. I know about that, too. And it might even be a help. - I don't get you. - This tire plant's a vital industry, Gargen. And we have a big problem. We've got to hold our workers. And we've got to keep employee morale up. - Yes, I guess you're right. - We're having real trouble right now. A lot of our men are involved with loan sharks. - Well, what has that got to do with me and a job, Mr. Rennick? - There may be some of our employees working for these money vultures, Gargen. I want to know who they are. Mr. Howell and the union officials do, too. - You bet we do. Our people are suffering because a few rats may be among them. If there are, we want to know it. - Maybe you could discover who's behind this loan shark outfit. If we could learn that, we'd find a way to break them. - I'm sorry, that's out of my line. I just wanted an ordinary job. So long, gentlemen. - Well, that didn't take long. - Too long. - Joe, wait. What happened? - Nothing. But thanks for the try, kid. - That's right. If any of you know guys on other shifts who are paying off, talk to 'em. Tell 'em we're getting together and going to the cops. - There's a guy over in compound who's been paying off for years. - Get him over here next time-out period. Hey, Charlie? - Yeah? - I talked to 10 guys so far today, Charlie. Guys in hock to Donelli. - Yeah? - Six of 'em said you were the bird who first told 'em where they could borrow dough or got 'em in that back room to gamble. - So? - What are you doing, Charlie? Getting a cut for steering guys in? - Now, see here, fella. Don't be throwing knives at me. What's eating you anyway? Just this: We're finding out from all the guys who first steered 'em. If your name comes up many more times, Rennick's gonna get an earful. - Joe, where have you been? Ann phoned over an hour ago. What happened with Mr. Rennick? - It's no dice, Marty. He had a special job in mind and I'm just an ordinary guy who wants to live a quiet life. - Well, I don't understand, didn't he-- - This is gonna be a bad luck town for me, kid. I better shove off while I'm still even. - Oh, don't talk so silly, Joe. Well, there were plenty of other jobs around. We just thought it'd be nice if you worked with Ed and the rest. - Yeah, it'd have been real cozy. - Hello? Yes. - What's the matter? - Ed. Joe, Ed, he... Oh, Joe! - Well, that's just about it. The police are making a quiet investigation in the plant, but we're not disclosing that we suspect it was murder. - I'll handle it my way. Alone. - I regret the circumstances that brought it about, but I'm glad you've changed your mind. - My only picture is to dig up the guy who killed Ed. It might be necessary to dig deep into the loan shark outfit to accomplish that. - I can dig pretty good. - You let me know when you find out anything. Sure. I'll keep in touch with you. - My home phone is Republic 213-36. Can you remember that? - Republic 213-36. I got it. - What you're doing is not just important to you and me, Joe, it's important to a lot of people, a lot of wives and kids. - What I'm doing is strictly between us. Nobody else hears, you understand? Nobody. - Certainly. - Where do I start in the plant? - Handling crude rubber. When you're ready to move to another department, give me the word. Good luck. - You must have had more to talk about this time. - Any objections in having dinner some night with a fella from the crude rubber section? - You name the night. - My first payday. - It's a date. Oh, Joe. I'm glad you're with us. - Thanks. - What's the matter, Joe? Haven't you learned to love our sweet odor yet? - I smelled better stables. - Couple of more days and you'll think you're smelling violets. - You told me that two days ago. - So how did I know you were so sensitive? You know, when I first started working here, just walking out in the fresh air-- - You told me about it. - How it made me sick and all the things that happened? You'd never think those nice, round tires on your car had started out in a gooey mess like this, would you, Joe? - If you don't shut up, Tubby, I'll make a-- - Noon! - Now I can grab a smoke. - You mean you ain't going to eat any lunch? - Funny thing. I lost my appetite. - Ha! - Hey, Thompson. Thompson was Ed's section boss. This is Ed Haines' brother-in-law, Joe Gargen. - Glad to know you, Gargen. We were sure sorry about Ed. - Yeah, tough break. - Tough break? Is that all you got to say about a murder? - That's a big beef, Steve. Especially when you haven't got proof. - That's what I was telling the boys. - You don't seem very bothered about Ed's death. - Look, in the first place, we don't know for sure it wasn't an accident. - Oh, crud! - Second place, I told Ed not to do anything crazy. - What do you mean, it was Ed's fault? - If you guys are sucker enough to get on the hook, then you got to go through with it. - Gargen, you got ice water for blood and a hunk 'a rock for a heart. - Well, I'm off the shark's hook, thanks to the little ponies. - You mean you can still bet on a horse around here? - Sure, right across the street. Hey, I gotta get over there. There's a nag runner today I won on three times. - I'd sure like to take a flyer. If I had the scratch. I could sure use a little cash. - You're really busted, huh? - Flatter than Tubby's head.` - Well, seeing as how you're broke, I'll buy you a beer later, fellow, okay? - You got a customer. - Sit down, Joe. - Well, am I still in the deep freeze with you boys? - Nah, sit down. You're just trying to act tougher than you really are. - Hi, lover. What'll it be? - This here hank o' hair and bag o' bones is named Ivy, Joe. Anything you want, just ask her. - Anything? - Hmm, trouble. - Beer all around. Better make it five. Thompson's coming. - She's pretty cute. - Mm! - It looks like Charlie hit it again. - 85 bucks. When I retire from the plant, I'm just gonna sit around here and let the horses support me. - Too bad you weren't in on it, Joe. - Yeah, I could really use a stake like that. - Well, this is the way to get it. - Here you are, lover. I dipped my finger in it, just to make it sweeter. Those kinda eyes call for a slap in the face, love. - You got a real nice pair of eyes yourself, honey. - They're kinda pointed, but not hairy. You must be the first wolf who ever shaved his ears. - I wouldn't like to see you make a habit out of it, Joe, but maybe you could pick up some money in the crap game in the back. I'll get you a stake if you want to. - No, thanks. I never win when I really need it. - Well, maybe you better stay out of there anyway. A guy as broke as you is a cinch to get bitten by the loan sharks. - Now, there's a quick cash angle I forgot about. - And if you've got all your marbles, you'll keep on forgetting. - Yeah, but you fellas don't work it right. If you pay the loan sharks back right away, you never have any trouble with 'em. I'd like to meet that money man. Come on. - Five bucks interest. - Look, Mr. Donelli, I'm not getting any of the loan paid back. Can't you take half of that five on the loan money? - No, and you're two weeks behind on your interest payments. Make it up. - You can't get blood from a stone. - Don't make us try. - My friend here needs a little cash, Mr. Donelli. - You work at the plant? - Yeah, I work at the plant. - Okay, we might arrange a loan. - Well, I gotta run, fella. I'll see you tomorrow. - Okay. - How much you want? - Well, 50'll do. - $5 a week interest till you're paid up. - If it takes me 10 weeks to pay off, I'm being clipped 50 bucks interest on a $50 loan. - And if it takes a year, you're paying 260 bucks interest. Do you want it? - 260? That's 500%. Well, that's kinda high, isn't it? - Go try a bank, then. - Oh, don't get excited. I'll take it. - A little information. Name? - Joe Gargen. 914 Bronson Avenue. - Make your payments every Friday. - I'll try hard. - I wouldn't miss if I were you. - I won't miss. - Welcome to the club, sucker. - You're off to a good start, Joe. - There's nothing started that I can't handle. Including a little date tonight on Mr. Donelli's money. Where's the phone booth around here? Thanks. - A wonderful dinner, Joe. Only I wish you'd waited until payday. - I tried. But the strain was too much. - Paul told me where you got the money. - Paul talks too much. - Oh, it's just that he was a little worried. He knows I like you and... - Then how about me putting my arms around you on the dance floor? - Like it? - Love it. It's kinda dangerous. - What is? - Being this close. - It's the perfume, I guess. I think you'll cool off now, though. - Just the top burner. The oven's still warm. Waiter. Check, please. - Are we leaving? - Yes, I thought you might like to show me the ocean or something. Keep the change. - Thank you, sir. - It's my car. I might make you walk home. Not me. I give in too easy. - Gotta hand it to you. Don't know how you did it. Took me a year to get this far. You made it in two months. - It's all in having talent, my boy. And knowing the boss's secretary. Well, how did we do on that dog in the fourth, Charlie? - But don't worry, fella. I'll get us even tomorrow. I got a horse that can't lose. - Why don't you smarten up, Joe? If you're as serious about Ann as you claim, you-- - Why don't you lay off, Paul? Stop playing Mother Abbess. - Oh, there's Joe now. - Ann. Why don't you stay away from that guy? - Don't be silly, Paul. - He's the wrong guy for you, Ann. He's still in debt to the sharks. He gambles his pay away and-- - Please, Paul. - Where did you get a driver's license? Steal it? - I want a word with you. - Talk fast, I'm in a hurry. - You're five weeks behind on your payments. Get it up. - Say, you talk real tough. - This is a polite notice, Gargen. It's the last one you'll get. - Thanks. Sue me. - Gargen! You're not acting like a very bright boy, Gargen. - I like to keep even with the guy I'm talking to. Hiya, beautiful. - Hi. - Paul. I'm beginning to think your brother doesn't like me. - But I do. You're the type that'd pick up a stray dog and mother 'em. The names he calls himself. Who was that man you were talking to? - That was no man, that was a leech. Wiggle your hips over, chicken. We gotta go. - All right. You hardly got wet. What's the matter? - You have to be part polar bear to stay in that water. Besides, I'm a guy not much for swimming. - Oh, that's a shame. 'Cause you look so cute in a bathing suit. - I got news. You do a thing or two yourself in-- - Now, don't get fresh, fella. You know, you're a handy guy to have on a picnic. If you could cook I might marry you. - Wait till you're asked, lady. - I don't have to, it's leap year. - Say, that's right. I better watch my step. - You ain't been just toying with my affections these past months, have you, mister? - When a guy'll go swimming in weather like this, he's gotta be in love. - Ah, my guy's a sissy! It isn't even cold tonight. - Then how come I turned into an icicle when I come out of that water? - You must've thawed out. Feels warm now. Getting warmer all the time. - Hey. We're home. - Oh! I'll stick some coffee on while you're putting the car away. Gargen? - Yeah. - I got something for you. - That crumb Donelli send you? - I don't know Donelli. - Give him a message for me. Tell him Mr. Gargen said to come himself the next time. - Coffee'll be ready in a minute. - Oh, mind if I wash my hands? - Joe, what happened? - Oh, I just scraped it on the garage door. - How could you do that? - You ought to see the garage. - Joe, now... Now they're after you. - Now, how about my coffee? - Paul was right. He said you were headed for trouble. - Oh, there's no trouble, baby. Just a little misunderstanding. - Oh, Joe, I'm so scared. - Now who's the sissy? - Get in, Gargen. - Why? - I'd just like to have a little talk with you, Mr. Gargen. - We're talking. - I don't do business in the street. I'll buy you a drink and dinner, you name the place. - You know the Starlight Club? - Fine. Get in. - I'll go by taxi. - A careful man. Give him some cab fare. See you at the Starlight. - Your change from the cab fare. - Don't disappoint me and turn out to be honest. - I just wanted the ride, I wasn't after any profit. - Sit down. Say when. - Let's not get clubby. What's on your mind? - You gave our boy a pretty fair going over. - Never send a boy to do a man's job. - I shoulda handled it myself. - I'm trembling at the thought. - What's a fellow like you doing in a factory, Gargen? - I'm writing a novel about making tires. - You writing a novel about prisons when you did that stretch in the can? - How much do you make a week in that tire oven? Until they raise taxes again, I take home 58 bucks. - Chickenfeed. We could use a man like you, Gargen. Make yourself some real money. - You can't spend it behind bars. - People working for us don't go behind bars. I could start you at a hundred and a half a week. Buy you a car, some new clothes. I can't get rich on a hundred and a half. - Make it 200. That's clear. Paid in cash. No income tax. - What would I do? - Collections. You'd work along with Lou for a while till you know how we operate. I know how you operate. I owe you 50 bucks. Plus 25 interest. Remember? - Forget it. - The way you toss dough around, you must boss the outfit. - You just do as I say and everything'll be fine. You want a job? - Don't rush me. I'll think it over. - Don't take too long. - Vince, I tell you, we're leading with our chins. - You heard what Thompson said about him. - It don't add up that Gargen don't care what happened to his brother-in-law. - He's one of those hard apples who likes money better than he does relatives. Besides, Thompson said the guy is convinced that it was an accident. - Could be an act. - If it is, we want him where we can keep check, don't we? If it isn't, we got ourselves a good man. - Well, if he's coming in with us, I'm going to stick to him closer than his underwear. - Hello, Joe. What's up? - I got a little news, but I couldn't give it to you on the phone. - You find something in the plant? - I'm pretty sure I know who our boy is, but I can't prove it. I got an offer to join the sharks. - What do you think? - I'm going to do it. I can't do any more in the plant. I'm sure I can peg our man through the outfit. - You find out who's running this thing and every plant in town will be indebted to you, Joe. - I'll find out. But don't tip my play. Not even to Ann. - No, of course not. You should be protected, though. What about letting the police-- - No. I said I'd handle this alone. - Whatever you say, Joe. - All right, my girl, there you are. All right. - I'm through tonight at seven, lover. You interested? - Someday, Ivy, I'm liable to take you up on one of your invitations. Then what would you do? - Sweetie, with you I'd forget everything my mother taught me. - What about me, Ivy? - With you I'd just forget. - Come on, you guys. I got something I want to show you. - You're still 20 behind, Buckley, let's have it. - I haven't got it. - On payday? I'll cash your check in. - I cashed it. Over in the crap game. The 10's what's left. - Want to know why he didn't show up at the plant today? Take a look. He's learning how to be a loan shark. - Okay, Casmer, you made your payment. Beat it. I said beat it. Better get up that 20 next week, Buckley, or we won't play anymore. Go on, shove off. - What's the take here, Donelli? - Oh, about a grand a week. - Hmm, I figured it was better than that. - Yeah, well, we're operating in 20 other plants around town. - Sounds better. Who gets the biggest slice? - Why do you care, Gargen? - I just wanted to know who you turn the dough into. - You'll find out later. - Why set up your collection center in this crummy neighborhood? - The neighbors mind their own business. - Well, well, if it isn't my old sparring partner. - Delta Tires. - Right. - Ah, how's it going? - Good day. He can write figures down, I guess that's something. - Fix yourself a drink. - Thanks. When do I stop playing pencil pusher? - In a few weeks they'll put you in a spot of your own. - Why the hideout? I thought you people couldn't be touched. - If the federal tax boys got a look at the money coming in here, it could be embarrassing. Ah. - Figures from the aircraft plants. - Okay. Hey, Walter, this is Joe Gargen. Walter Kerr, our bookkeeper. - Hiya. Gargen just joined up with us today. - I'm glad to meet you. Walter's one fella you have to worry about all the time, Gargen. - That so? He's dangerous? His books are, if your figures don't add up with his every night. Good, uh-huh. - What kinda profit you doing here, total? Or is that none of my business? - Well, I can tell you it runs into thousands a week. - Hmm. Not bad for just factories. - We've got other tie-ins. Bookies who send us the suckers who can't pay their tabs. Certain used car dealers who steer us to guys behind in their payments. - I got an angle for you that'd kicked your takeaway up. I'm surprised that you boys never thought of it. - A guy with ideas already. - What's the angle? - Wait till big ears shoves off. - Donelli! You know better than to pull a rod in here. Stop tangling with Donelli. He's dangerous. And we don't like feuds in the outfit. - Then keep him out of my hair. - Just stop needling him. Let's hear this angle of yours. - Housewives. - Yeah, what about 'em? - They always need dough. They play cards, they lose. Bet a horse, they lose. They're afraid to tell their husbands. - How do we get to them? - Their laundry service. - Laundry? I don't follow. - Start a laundry or buy one. We put our own men on for deliveries. - That's a big deal. But it's got possibilities. We'd have a legit business tied in with our operation. That's good. - And I'll run it. Agreed? - Now, not so fast. I don't even know if we'll go for it. - You got to talk it over with somebody first? - What gives you that idea? - Well, it's been a long day. Goodnight. - Oh, it's you. - Why? Were you expecting someone else? Turn off the chill, baby. What's the matter? - I found out why you quit your job. - News travels fast. - Especially bad news. - 200 a week isn't bad. - Oh, Joe, how could you? - Money is a handy thing, baby. Their dough is good and they got plenty of it. - It's not good for me, Joe. - What do you mean by that? - I love you. If you love me, you'll give up this whole crazy, dirty thing. - I can't, Ann. - If that's final, Martha wants no part of it, either. She's giving up her apartment and moving in with me. - And Brother Joe is never to darken your door again, is that the story? - That's the way you've written it. - Okay, Ann. Goodbye. - There she is, Joe. The first of the new trucks. We'll have 12 more inside a month. - Yeah, we're in business. - And we'll clean up. Clean up, laundry business. Good gag, huh? - Side-splitting. Now, let's get down to the ugly details. Where do I stand? - You're running the place. Getting 300 a week's salary. What more do you want? - I don't give ideas like this for three bills a week. - Look, Joe, it cost us a bundle to buy this plant. Take it easy awhile, huh? - Okay, Vince. For a while. - Hi, Mrs. Hilton. - Hello. - Your bill's three weeks old, Mrs. Hilton. Can I collect today? - Gosh, I'm kind of short right now. Can't you let it go another week? - Well, if you need dough, why don't you make a little loan from the company? - From the company? - Sure. They'll give you a cash and add it to your weekly bill. You pay off painlessly. - Well, fine. Could I get 25? - No sooner said than done. There you are. - Oh, this is wonderful. Now, you pay two bucks a week interest till you've paid off. It'll appear on your bill as a charge for special services. - Two dollars a... - So long, Mrs. Hilton. Hi. Hiya, Rourke. - Hi. - Come in. Hiya, Norm. You're a little late. - Yeah, I got held up on some collections. - Trouble? - Two no-pays. One dame was a little soused, got kinda tough. - Okay, Norm. Tell Rourke to get on 'em. - Right. - If you miss another payment next week, we'll have to get in touch with your husband and collect from him. Goodbye, Mrs. Sloane. - Here's two more for you. That Higgins dame is three weeks behind. - Here's Norm's stop, Walter. He was the last man in. - Oh, I'm all finished up for now. I'll carry him over on next week's. There's your laundry ledger. - Hmm, not bad. Where's the loan book? - I told you, Mr. Gargen, you'll have to get Mr. Phillips to okay it. He says nobody sees the loan book but him. - Okay, Walter. I was just trying to wear you down. - I'll see you next week. - Try and get Mr. Phillips on the phone for me. - Right. Mr. Phillips on the phone. - Vince? You better take a run over here right away, pal. I got something very important to talk about. Uh-uh. Phones have ears, you know. This needs the personal touch. Okay. Yes? - If Donelli shows up while Phillips is in my office, keep him out. - I got you. You got here fast, Vince. - I didn't like your sound on the phone. What's on your mind? - I got a beef. The set-up's making big money, but I'm not. According to my figures-- - Figures? Who told you to keep figures? I send Kerr down every week to handle bookkeeping. - Yeah, you also told him not to show me the loan books. So I've been doing a little figuring myself. - I don't like this, Joe. - And I don't like my deal. I got a new one in mind. I want 25% of the laundry loan business. You're crazy. - Oh, I'm being easy on you. You got a profitable laundry and a whole new loan set-up. Thanks to me. - I might get you five. - Not interested. Maybe I better talk to the boss myself, Vince. It's about time. Don't you think? - What makes you keep on thinking there's another boss, Gargen? - You do, Vince. Just like now, for instance. You said you'd get me five. Not give me. - You got a big opinion of your own brains, Joe. You better watch out they don't run away with you. I'll let you know. - I'll be back in a couple of hours, Rourke. - Okay, Mr. Gargen. - Hello, Marty. - Joe. - How has everything been going? - All right. - Do you need anything, Marty? - No. Joe, I think you'd better go. - Well, if you ever do, you can always reach me at the Embassy Laundry. Hello, Ann. - What do you want here? - I'm just visiting my sister. It's an old family custom. - You don't have a family. Beat it. - Martha doesn't want to see you and neither do we. So why don't you just leave us alone? - Give this to Marty. - Hey, Gargen. Don't dirty up the apartment and take off. Another two minutes and we'll have to fumigate the place. - You're late this morning, Joe. - I had a bad night. And so far it's been a bad day, with this creep bird-dogging me. - Well, I've got to run. Just dropped by to tell you you're in for 10. - Okay, Vince, 10%. - What is this? Gargen getting a percentage? - This was his idea. And who are you to question anything, Lou? - I give you ideas and I'm still working under salary. - You've come up with nothing but stupid ideas and then carried them out yourself. Like telling Thompson to knock a guy off right in... You're getting too big for your pants, Lou. Go on, get out before I really blow up. - You accepted the 10% pretty easy, Joe. - I'll ride along for awhile, Vince. - Something new bothering you this morning? - No. I just had a bad night. - Glad to have you for a partner, Joe. Be seeing you. - How are you, Joe? - Not so good. - What's wrong? - I'm getting out, Mr. Rennick. I got what I wanted, the guy who killed Ed. - Who was it? - Thompson. - You're positive, Joe? - He'll spill his guts as soon as he sees a pair of handcuffs. - What about the head fellow? The man running the whole thing. - I didn't get to him. But you can grab Phillips and Donelli and knock over their whole setup. That's enough. - I know how you feel, Joe, but you've come this far-- - I've gone too far. Now I want to square this rep I got as a two-legged polecat. - If we don't get the boss of this loan shark group, it'll just start up again. - But it's not working out. Figured this laundry idea would get me to the top man fast. I don't like clipping housewives. - We'll fix that later. - I don't like what I'm doing to Ann and Marty. - If you could just hang on a couple of more weeks, Joe. That may be all the time you need. - Okay, Mr. Rennick. I'll do the best I can. - That's the stuff, Joe. - Answer the door, Nancy. Hey, you deaf? I said answer the door. - Hiya, Nancy. - Hi. - What do you want this early in the morning, Lou? - Early? It's nearly one o'clock. But I got a little news for you. - Oh, Vince! - Go practice in the bedroom. - How can I practice in the bedroom with no music? - You don't need music. Beat it. Well, what's on your mind, Lou? - Your boy Gargen. He's got rat in him, like I said. - Are you just saying it again or have you really got something? - He followed you from the laundry the other day. You lost him in the parking lot. Why didn't you tell me this before? - Well, I've been trying to get some more on him, but he hasn't been out of line since. - This could be just Joe's overgrown curiosity. - I got a way to find out. - How? - Last night Thompson told me we got another troublemaker at the Delta Plant. Paul Nelson. Gargen's girl's brother. - So? - So we send Gargen over to teach him a lesson. - I'll go dress. You call the garage for my car. - You two look like you're doubling for Sherlock Holmes. What's up? - I understand you got a little bloodhound in you, Joe. - You can talk plainer than that. - You tailed me from here a few days ago. - Yeah. I like to know everything that's going on. - I like to know how things stand, too. So I got a little job for you. Your girlfriend's brother's making trouble for us at Delta. - What kind of trouble? - Trying to get the boys to holler copper. Talking guys outta gambling. - He won't get any place. - He might, Joe. So he's got to learn to mind his own business. I want you to take care of it. - Okay. I'll talk to him. - Good. Lou will go along with you. I'd like to hear how you handle it. - And we don't mean talk. He's gonna learn a real lesson. - Tonight, eh, Joe? So I can stop worrying about you. - Let's go. Their car's gone, they must be out for the evening. I'll get him tomorrow. - We'll hang around. - I'm not going to sit here all night and bend my spine. Let's shove off. I'll catch him in the morning. - It's only been 10 minutes. - What's the matter, you nervous? That's him. Let's go. Paul, I want to talk to you for a minute. - Come along with me like nice little girls. - You, too, go on, beat it. - Get out of my way! Oh! You dirty yellow rat! - Not bad. It'll do for a starter. Let's go. - Is he all right, Ann? - Yes. But he wants to kill Joe. - Oh, I'm so ashamed. - He's gone too far this time, Marty. I'm gonna call the police. - They'll revoke his parole. He'll be sent back to prison. - I'm afraid that's where he belongs. And I wanted to marry him. I can't... I can't believe it's the same man. - Joe couldn't have changed so. There must be a reason for all this. - What possible reason could he have to justify what he's doing? - I don't know. - Maybe we better let the police find out his reasons. - Ann, wait! Don't call them yet. Wait till I come back. Please. - Where are you going? - You handled that better than I expected. I'll let you know if he needs another lesson. - Don't bother. You got gorillas that'll handle the muscle. Martha. What are you doing here? - I want to talk to you, Joe. - Go on home. Can't you see that I'm busy? - Joe, I've got to talk to you. - Go ahead, Joe, talk to your sister. I'm shoving off. See ya, Joe. - How is Paul? - Well, he's alive. No thanks to you. - I'm sorry about that, But it's something that had to be done. - Had to be done? Oh, Joe, what's it all about? What's happened to you? - Nothing has happened to me. I'm just doing a job and I don't want to talk about it. - Oh, Joe, it doesn't make sense. You're joining up with the people who killed Ed. - Martha, will you stop worrying about me? What I'm doing makes sense. - Oh, they did a fine job on you in that prison. They turned you into a thief, a dirty rotten beast! - Martha, will you let me handle my own affairs? Now, you go on home. Go on, beat it! - Ann was right! You belong in prison. You're going back. We'll go to the police tonight and see to that! - Marty! Mr. Rennick? Gargen. Look, this thing has come to a head. The rats started smelling a mouse. I had to give Paul Nelson a little going over. Yeah, sure, but I'm gonna try to wind this thing up tonight. I'm gonna take a stab at pressuring Phillips to take me to the head man. You better have Thompson picked up right away. Stay close to the phone. I'll give you a blast if I can make it. Right. Bye. - You've been real sharp, peeper, but you never conned me for a minute. - Yeah. You got less sawdust in your head than I figured. - Come on, I'm gonna take you down and show you how the boilers work in the laundry. You never really inspected them. - You better check with Phillips before you carry out any more of your stupid ideas, Donelli. - Uh-uh. I've been thinking about this boiler gag for a long time. You're gonna be the cleanest stiff in town. - Hey, you hear something? - Huh? Hear what? - Look, if that box had a bed in it, you'd sleep there. Get your ear out and answer the door. - Hiya, Nancy, is Vince-- - Hi. - Kinda late to come calling, isn't it, Joe? - Not when you got trouble. - Aw, Vince! - Go on in the bedroom. - Well, what'll I do in there alone? - Play with your fur coats. What kind of trouble? - That big idea of yours backfired. The police are getting the news about me slugging Paul Nelson tonight. - So what? - So I'm slapped with another prison rap. You better leave town for a while. - I am leaving town. For good. But I need a chunk of cash. 50,000. - 50,000? - For my 10% partnership. - You don't have 10% anymore. Take off, Gargen, have a nice trip. - Remember those figures I was keeping, Vince? I got 'em down in a little book all of my own. - What does that mean? - It means that the income tax people will get a big earful of that undeclared cash you boys have been pocketing. - Why you cheap, lowdown-- - Relax, Vince. You didn't think I'd be sucker enough to take a rap alone, did you? - Look, Joe, we're both excited. We can figure a way out of this. - I have. 50,000. - I haven't got that much cash lying around. - Then let's talk to the boss man. He must have it sticking out of his ears. - It's kinda late. But I'll do what I can. You go home and wait. - Oh, no. I'll stick with you, Vince, to help sell him on the idea. And don't mention you're bringing a friend. Don't tell me he lives here. - In an apartment upstairs. - I don't get it. - He's crazy about the theater. So he bought one. What's the idea of this? - The idea is he's got a rope around our necks. - What do you think you're up to, Gargen? - So you're the boss man of the outfit. Tell me, why were you shoving a pencil around? - What's it to you? - He wants $50,000, Walter. He's got to leave town. - Well, why should we give him $50,000? - He kept his own books on the laundry loans. He'll tip the whole setup if we don't pay him off. - This is the man you were so sure of, Phillips? - Don't get excited, Kerr. Just get up the 50 G's. - He's got it coming to him anyway, Walter. - Yeah, maybe you're right. Maybe he does deserve a better break. And whatever he deserves, he should get. And he will. Get after him with that! Gargen! - Good job, Gargen. You'd have made a pretty fair cop. - Somehow the idea never entered my mind, Lieutenant. Oh. Here's a present for you. - Joe. All I'll say now is thanks. There's a very capable secretary waiting in my... - Let's get out of here. Some wise guy's liable to start selling tickets to this performance.
