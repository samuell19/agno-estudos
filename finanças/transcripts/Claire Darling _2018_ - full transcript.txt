What are you doing here? - I want to stay with the elephant clock. I'm afraid of the dark. - Don't be childish. Off to your room! Hurry up. I beg your pardon? Tell me, who are you? So. I'm ready. You look like you've seen a ghost. No, but it's been a long time. Are you well, Madame Darling? No, but nice of you to ask. Can you do me a favor? Yes of course. Why doesn't she come herself? At home for years, she's going crazy. PRIVATE FLEA MARKET EVERYTHING MUST BE OUT ANNUAL MARKET AND CIRCUS FIREWORKS AT MIDNIGHT Farewell, dear ones. A new life begins for you. A happy life. Do you need help? - No, thanks, it works. Madame? Sorry, we have to go. Where? We still have to clear out the ground floor. Yes, but we work in the quarry. If we come too late, it matters. We're getting into trouble. You work in the quarry? - Yes, on the weekends. Don't worry, the quarry is mine. I just call there. It won't work. The quarry belongs to Chinese. Chinese? What! My husband is the operator. Aha, he smokes! In your age! You smoke too. - In your age... How old am i - I do not know... 80? I do not believe that. Madame, we really have to go. Are you paying us? Yes, yes, wait. I get money. Madame Darling? She scratches off. - Does she need help? Everything OK? Yes, it’s fine. Thanks my boy. Here is the money for all of you. For that you help me clear the whole house. Are you there - Yes, of course. Naturally. I should get my hat. You got that on your head, mom. Darling, what are you doing here? Again this overall. It doesn't suit you at all. Why is everything outside? Was that you, Martin? This is your business. And my name is Lucas. Lucas Mercier. Yes, I'm sorry. Sorry, Lucas... Mercier. Which furniture should still be out? There is not much space left. Yes you are right. We'll get the rest when we sell something. OK. - Sit down in the café, yes? I have you called. I have to give you money! - No, you've already paid us. Right! You are really very nice, Amir. Thank you! - Open the gate wide. Amir is good. Better than Rashid. Shut up, Martin! - Who's Martin? A clown who plays the guitar! Did you see? Such a beautiful magician. - They scare me. But they are not expensive. - No. Not? Then we go. Thank you. - See you again. Madame Darling? Don't you recognize me? I would be lying if I said "yes". I am Martina. Martine Leroy, Marie's girlfriend. Marie, yes. - We were in elementary school together. Yes. Yes, Leroy, yes... But yes, little Martine! Hello dear how are you - Good. How much do you want for it? 50 cents? - Okay. Here you go. Goodbye. Thank you very much. 50 cents? But... What are you doing? Can not you see that? That will be good for my till. - But... What exactly are you selling? Everything. I sell everything. And why? Well, that's why, my little one... If you want to sell everything can I call an expert. I just bought back two 19th century angels. They had sold it to the lady for 20 euros. It doesn't matter, the price is only symbolic. People like bargains. - Do you also sell your machines? And the angels will get you back. - Back? What am I supposed to do with it? Should I call Marie? - No way. That is just missing. Do you have fire? I don't find mine. - Yes. Hello Martina. - Hi there. Good to see you! Do you also browse a bit? Yes. How much for the desk? 20 Euros. A very good choice. My great grandfather... bought it from Baron Malevray in 1920. He is said to have hidden the embalmed hand of his lover in it. He had cut it off as a punishment for her infidelity. Nevertheless, they continued to love each other. But you have to take it with you right away. I have to get rid of everything. Good... - Everything has to go by tonight. In case you change your mind... No chance. Here is the library. Here is the living room and my brother Martin. Stop it. So then... No, mom, don't go away! Well, I'll get you something to eat quickly. Oh yes, I'm hungry. I want to eat something! A magic clock, it helps you fall asleep. Are you little martine You have a good taste. Have you ever seen a collection? - No. This was made in the 19th century. From a great watchmaker. I bought these for my little Martin. She is beautiful. It was made in 1910. Mom, he's annoying me. - No, it annoys me. Marie! I don't sell them. - I thought you were selling everything. But not that. Take something else, but not the watch. Where is she? Mind your own business? - Nothing... I just want her to be safe. - That's kind of you. Can you get the boys out of the cafe? We're running out of goods. No, I'm sorry, that's insane. Well, then I'll go myself. Octave! Damn it! Come here! Mummy? This is probably a German device. German? - I guess so. That's my grandmother. Mummy? Hello my sweetheart. Do you want to help me? What do you do? Why is everything outside? Not everything. Half the living room has to go out and the dining room... It is no small thing. Fortunately, the boys help me. What is wrong with you? Do you need money? Honey, you are not preventing me from selling my things. Your interest comes too late. Do you want one Smoking is good for the nerves. Marie? Yes, mom, it's me. You have gained a bit. So what brings you here suddenly? I've been fine without you all these years. Thank you! How are you? Quite well. Quite well? Is that all? Tell me... Tell me how you are. Are you all right? Am i grandmother You do not have to answer me. I'm almost sure you're not really here. Lately I've felt like you're going to be gone soon. Disappear? But I'm here. You could also be dead. Are you dead my darling Your brother was here this morning. Tell me what's going on. Today is my last day. - Your last day of what? Of my life, darling. Of my life. Where is your father? Pilar didn't come either today. Just see... All the dust! Do you see? This is... Alright, alright. Why did you come back To give me back my ring? - your ring? You already know. The ring you stole from me. How can you talk about this ring today? It is a very valuable ring. It is an important family heirloom, it brings luck. My grandmother got him for the wedding. - I didn't steal it! As I said, died in Papa's desk. - You didn't tell me anything. Where's the desk - Don't scream like that, I hear you very well. Oh, I wanted to make tea! Will you help me That should go down, but it's hard. No, leave it now. Chill out. I'll make you your tea, right? I'll be right back. Yes? What do you do? You see, right? Why don't you put everything on the bench? Property tax... Does it mean anything to you? Prefer thieves to Mitterand? - Claire, please. I need money for a very nice mechanical doll. I want to replace the broken one. By the way, it was my favorite piece. No, I can't. I beg your pardon? - I can not. Not now. I told you we were in trouble. I thought we are wealthy. - No quibbling, yes! Don't forget where your money comes from. I only want 1000 francs for a doll before you lose all my money. Oh yes? Here! There you have your money So you're fine then? - So so. I didn't know if you were still in Paris. Last time you wanted to leave. Yes, but I've been back recently. You have to tell me everything. I want to know everything. Thank you for calling. - Have you seen her? She looked completely beside her. She said she would die today. It is so sad. I drove all morning and saved what I could. You have to stop them. She just mentioned a ring earlier. She thinks I stole it. I had hidden him in the desk. She must have sold it. Hello, Madame Hiram. Look at Marie Darling... Nice that you drop by. Coffee? Juice? - No, we have... May I? - Yes. Did you happen to find a ring in the desk? A ring? - No. Pretty old and... No, I only found garbage, but no ring. It didn't open it, but it did. What am i doing here It stinks of bad luck. My mother should have run away like me. Leave everything behind. I don't want her stuff. Neither her house nor anything else from her! You don't know how lucky you are. The house is a work of art! It's all a work of art. She has to... - Can you please stop? Marie, I'm sorry... - I just need fresh air. I run a bit, then I feel better. Please stop. The costume suits you. Are you spying on me - No, I'm just looking at you. Aren't you wearing it anymore? - What? Your ring. - Do not touch! I thought he was for me? Yes, when you get married. What if nobody wants me? Or if I don't want one? Someone will want you. It’s coming. It always is. If you say so... Not even you want me anymore. You are wrong, darling. In any case, I will not marry. What do you do? I go from. Where are you going? - You get on my nerves. To the notary. You hurt me, dear. You never called for help. What'? How dare you? - I know it, I'm sure! Get out. Immediately! Aim and shoot. Great prizes are waiting for you. So, gentlemen, who will take the car home for the little ones? Fishing is not for everyone. Tonight, June 21 at 8 p.m. Zircus Benzini is visiting Verderonne with his new program. See our human pyramid! Our acrobats climb the sky. Lorelei, the tightrope walker! Magda, the living rubber band! Nicole, the crazy juggler! The huge, breathtaking Gaäl... The dancing camel. The singing lamas. The Lion Moko... ARE CEMENT DARLING CEMENT Your father is terrible. I don't spend long in the quarry. - Very funny, Amir. Do you like uniforms? Why do you keep the shit part? - Too lazy to move. Are you coming to the party today? - No. I have to go tomorrow morning. And you, Marie? - Maybe. I pick you up. - Okay. -See you. Come on, we'll take the shortcut. Look here! This is a dung beetle. - Yuck. Don't say ugly. They are based on the light of the sun, the moon and the Milky Way. Also on small... For example on light reflections in water drops... Mummy? Can Martine stay with us? Here is the Verderonne Community Center. Father Georges Van Der Meersch is currently not available. Please leave a message. Georges? Could you come please? I am waiting for you tonight. Be careful, the step is broken. Hello, Father. - Good afternoon, Madame Darling. Call me Claire. - Call me Georges. May I? - Why, surely. Madame Taillandier was right, it's really nice. You said it was a Monet? Check it out. Yes indeed... "J.C. Monet" is probably not that famous. - I tell her that too. You're welcome. Pedigree or not, I find it comforting. I agree. The beauty of things around us elevates our soul, doesn't it? A very nice ring. - Yes. My mother called it the love ring. It also bears an inscription. "Love"... What is the other word? "Forever". Forgive the question, can I buy it from you? The question is forgiven, but it is not for sale. But you can watch it at any time. Very much. Good... It's lucky to have you with us, Georges. Careful, the level. Come. I have killed him. - Claire! "May the beauty give you comfort. Keep it as long as you want. Georges. " Oh no, not now. Let's see how much I have. I offer you 70 euros. - No. Is she? Is this your watch? Go in, go in! Thank you! Really, thank you very much! Nothing to thank for. Hello Claire. Amir, my little Amir! You recognize me today. I always recognize you. - Not always. No? - No. Good thing you tell me when I'm talking nonsense. So you're doing a flea market? Better call it a nervous breakdown. I received a clear message tonight. Crystal clear even. From whom? I don't know... god? If it was from God... - Amir. i will die tonight. So are you selling everything? It seems to me to be a good reason. Madame Darling, you won't die tonight. I've wasted enough time wishing death... Should I make you tea? I saw your plane today. Yes that was me. A gendarme. - Make fun of me. I think it suits me. What about your hair - You are different now, like everything. Do not you like it? - Yes, see It's just unusual. Why don't you hug me - Of course I hug you. Excuse me. Amir, can't you stop that? Not until she asks me to. She is of legal age. And in full possession of their spiritual powers? - Officially yes. I visit them sometimes. When she recognizes me, she opens it. Does she sometimes tell you about me? Not much. Don't go, Martin! I miss you so much. How are you my sweetheart? - Good. I'm fine where I am. It's not as terrible as you think. For real? Yes. You have to let go, mom, do you understand? Let go. It is very good. And your father? Your hair color is very special. Nice to see you, darling. But that doesn't bring my ring back to me. -Please stop it. Why? It means a lot to me. I have nothing left of my mother. Stop it! I never had your ring. You would know that if you had read my letters. She's lying when she opens her mouth. Maybe there is more. - Yes here... These are francs, they are worth nothing. - Yes, on the Internet, yes! These are my books. - Are you kidding me? Are you serious when you say that. Yes, they are my books. - No... But! And what is that? What's going on here? - Nothing at all. Quiet, they're sensitive. - Give me the box. Give it up, little one! What do you want with that? Give them to me. - Put that back! The books are not for sale! Get off my lawn! Get out! What are you doing here? Get out! Thieves Pack! - You hear it. Go home. The flea market has ended, please go. Put that down again! Please, Mademoiselle. - Put the books back. Do it already. - Really... So what! He doesn't shy away from anything! - Go now. Thank you. Young man, young woman, please go. Please leave things here now. Madame, please hurry up! Guys, we bring everything in. Take the armchair. So please go. Are you all right, mom? Do you help with the sofa? First the big things. Are you really okay? - Yes. If you need me, call me at home. Or in the store. So bye. - Bye. After all, it's a bit tidier. Are you staying for a while Yes... I can't leave her alone like that. I have to organize things, find solutions, make decisions... Exactly my thing. Do you have children? - Yes a daughter. Your mother and I are separated. It makes us pay dearly for that. The full load. You can go quietly. All right, I have time. I'll only pick them up in two hours. Sorry, I don't know what... - No... You can cry calmly. - But I do not want to. I'm tired of this sadness. I have to do something, I can't take it anymore! Take me to the quarry. I'll be right there. Are you feeling better? What do you do? I'm waiting, darling, I'm waiting... On what? I told you it’s time tonight. I'll finally find out what's next. But don't do anything stupid. No, I promise. If I wanted to, I would have done it long ago. Amir gone? No, he's still there. We're going for a lap, okay? What should I have against it? I'm back soon. Hi there? What'? What'? What happened? Where? No, I'm coming right away. What happened? What happened? You know, you have to be very strong now. It is Martin. When I saw your mother afterwards, I thought she was mad at me. Because I was still alive. But no, she saw me... and hugged me tightly. And you too. I think about it all the time. Nobody ever explained it to me correctly. We could never talk about it. The polisher should have detonated the explosive device. It was late, he was already gone. I refused to do it. But Martin agreed. Probably to prove to his father that he could. And your father let him do it. Maybe I should have said yes, Martin would still be here. My father shouldn't have allowed it. The time has not come yet. Madame Darling, good evening. Aren't you saying Claire to me anymore? Claire, I'm sorry. A long time ago, what, Georges? You asked me to come. Do you remember? Pardon. So, Georges... What leads you to me As I said, you called me. Maybe it has something to do with your flea market? God told me to do it. Incredible, you turn to God all the time, but when God speaks to you, don't believe it. "God"... does that tell you what? I wanted to tidy up the house a bit before I die. But it was all so difficult. So hard! And all these things... You accompanied me for a while, each in its own way. I don't need them anymore today. But... Maybe you are going through some kind of crisis? You have always felt guilty. When time passes, we often feel the need to create order internally. Oh no, please! Oh no! Save the talk for the old women. It's not about inner order. Don't come to me like that, Georges! Come up with something else! One thought is enough if it is correct and profound. And just don't start: "The ways of the Lord are unfathomable." Are you hurt? Think about something. I'm still waiting. There's the story of the young, presumptuous man who wants to know how to get to the kingdom of heaven. And Jesus tells him to sell his belongings and give them to the poor. The only thing he was unable to do. The problem is not the objects, not the things but the thing. Everyone has something that is big and blinds us and prevents it from moving forward. Thank you, now I know why I called you. You have to perform an exorcism. You're kidding! We haven't done that for a long time. - But now you do it. Not resist talking. You do it, don't you? I choke. Please, Georges, do it for me. For us. No, Claire. Claire? - Yes. Was the water lily sold? What water lily? Oh yes, our water lily. It was so beautiful! I do not know. She was still there this morning. Now... Will you remember me a little? To us? They were always on my mind. Mom, look. Come on now. Marie needs you. I need you. Never touch me again. - Claire... I hate you. I hate you! I never want to see you again. You killed him I never want to see you again. You killed him You killed him You killed him! Father! I called the emergency doctor. They are coming. - Father! So are you coming? - Maybe. But I'm afraid of flying on small planes. You do not know what you're missing. - I said maybe not. Yes / Yes... Mummy! Mummy! She fell over. But I didn't hit her. It's about an accident... Do you hear me? -... in front of the castle of Verderonne. A woman passed out. I am lost. Lost. Marie... Yes? I watched your father die and did nothing. Please stop. You called the emergency doctor. Do I have that? Did you see how I called? - Yes. Yes. Are you sure? - Yes I am sure. Oh, Marie, stay here. Do not leave me. Do not leave me. - I stay here. The doctor says it's nothing serious. I was so scared. I missed you so much. I am glad that you are here. My little. Look here... See what I have found. Wait a moment... You have tender fingers Like your brother. Do what you want with it. I want you to be happy. Not like me. I did everything wrong with you. I was so hard. But that helped me persevere. My idea was good, wasn't it? So you came back. Now you don't have to be afraid anymore. You are tall now. I'll put the elephant clock back in your room if you want. What do you say to that, miss? Don't squeeze me like that, you... Let me go now, honey. You hurt me. Madame Darling? Are everyone in their seats and buckled up? Here we go! Hold the steering wheel firmly! In the name of God our Almighty Father. In the name of Jesus Christ our son our Lord. With the power of the Holy Spirit may you become exorcised water to deprive the enemy of any strength. Eternal Almighty God strengthen my will, bless and sanctify in your mildness this salt, that you provided to man so that all those who take it for the salvation of body and soul. And you, prince of the heavenly host, by virtue of your power, throw in the depths of hell Satan and all evil spirits, that roam the world and destroy souls. Amen. Who are you, then? But what... I'm making tea now. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Very nice! Mummy... For Marie-Claire and Caroline BABELFISCH TRANSLATIONS Subtitle: Veronika Sandkühler
