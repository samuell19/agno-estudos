Oh, come on, Jo, pull yourself together! Move with it! (Blows final whistle) You're not much good at netball, are you, Jo? No, I’m bad on purpose. - Are you going dancing tonight? - l can't. You never go anywhere, do you? l haven't got any clothes to wear, for one thing. - And for another... - What? We might be moving home again. Like gypsies, you and your mother. So what? Don't think it's the first time I’ve heard you and your men friends here in the afternoon. This is a respectable house and I mean to keep it that way. l warned you when you first came, no gentlemen and pay regular. You owe me two months' rent. lf l don't have it by tomorrow, you're out! l don't want any more of your fancy men coming in here. - And that's my last word! - Oh, shut up, you'll get your rent. Suppose that means another flit? She's always glued to television at tea time. We can slip out that window. Now, come on, hurry up! Be a bit useful for a change.

See ya. - This the bedroom? - Well, what do you think? Sharing a bed again, I see. l can't bear to be parted from you for a minute(!) What l wouldn't give for a room of me own. Oh, isn't that awful? Well, don't look at it, then. I do hate to see an unshaded light bulb dangling from the ceiling like that. - Ooh! God, it's hot! - Oh, you do get on my nerves! Why can't you leave things alone? - l can get a proper shade tomorrow. - What makes you think we'll live that long? The roof's leaking. No, it's not, it's condensation.

What's the little lady want, an engagement ring? l always accept the odd diamond ring with pleasure. (Jo coughs) - Who's that? - it’s me daughter. - Hello, then. - What's this one called? Oh, go to bed, go on! - Are you coming? - Not yet. Then I’ll wait for you. is she always like this? - She's jealous. - That's something l didn't bargain for. (Sneezes) - She ought to be in bed. - l know. Shall l retire while you kiss her good night? I’ll kiss you good night, young lady! Look after your mother while she's ailing. You know how fragile these old ladies are. - Oh, buzz off! - (Door slams, man laughs) Ooh, he's a noisy beggar, that one. What's that bed like? Like a coffin, only half as comfortable. it’s where we all end up in the end. Oh, now, come on, Jo, get that light off and let's get to bed. - Aren't we going to clear this luggage up? - Oh, it'll look all right in the dark. Yeah, it's seen at its best, this room, in the dark. Everything's seen at its best in the dark. Even me. l can't understand why you're so frightened of it. it’s not the darkness outside I’m frightened of. it’s the darkness inside houses l don't like. Hey, Jo, what would you do if l told you l was thinking of getting married again? I’d have you locked up in an institution right away. (Laughs) (Sneezes) (Coughs) - You're up early. - it’s a long way from here to school. Not for much longer, thank God. Only a few more days. You're still set on leaving, then. What are you going to do? Get out of your sight as soon as possible. Get a bit of money in me pocket. Well, it's your life, ruin it your own way. Takes me all me time to look after meself. - Here, love, you've forgotten this... Oh. - Give those to me! - Oh, l say. - Leave them alone, I’ll pick them up. - Have you done these? - Yes. Oh, I didn't realise I’d got such a talented daughter. I’m not just talented, I’m geniused. What's these? Self-portraits. Oh, give 'em here. l suppose you've got to draw yourself, nobody else'd draw you. Hey! is that supposed to be me? Yes. Don't l look a proper misery? Still, it's very artistic, in't it? Tell me, Jo, have you ever thought of taking it up properly and going to art school? I’ve had enough of schools. Too many different schools in too many different places. Well, l think you're wasting yourself, l do. So long as l don't waste anybody else. Anyway, why are you so suddenly interested in me? You never cared much before. l know. I’m a cruel, wicked mother(!) ''The voice l hear this passing night was heard ''In ancient days by emperor and clown: ''Perhaps the selfsame song that found a path ''Through the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick for home ''She stood in tears amid the alien corn; ''The same that ofttimes hath ''Charm'd magic casements, opening on the foam ''Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn. ''Forlorn! the very word is like a bell ''To toll me back from thee to my sole self. ''Adieu! the Fancy cannot cheat so well ''As she is famed to do, deceiving elf. ''Adieu! adieu! thy plaintive anthem fades ''Past the near meadows, over the still stream, ''Up the hillside; and now 'tis buried deep...'' (Crash) (School bell) Oh! Hey! Don't you remember me? Oh, yes, you helped us off the bus. That's right. What you doing out here? What are you? I’m the cook. What's the matter with your knee? l fell down some steps at school. Looks bad. Needs a bandage. Come on, I’ll fix it for you. Where are we going? Come on. They're all off duty. Come on! I’ve never been on one of these before. it’s all right. Mind your 'ead. So this is where you do your cooking, is it? Yes, this is it. Now, come on. Let's have a look at it. - Oh, very 'handsome! - Sure, now, come on! Don't be so soft. l won't hurt you, I’m very professional. - What were you doing round here, anyway? - l was kept in late at school. l didn't want to go home until me mam had gone out with her boyfriend. l often come this way.

Oh, go on, l don't fancy it. - l may never ask you again. - Oh, go on! l want to make an honest woman of you. - Oh, go on, you're drunk. - I’m not, I’m not. I’m old enough to be your mother. You know l like this mother-and-son relationship. Oh, stop it! - Aren't you wearing your girdle? - Oh, give over! Well, you certainly liberate something in me and it's not maternal instincts, either! l must go in. I’ve got to see about a job tomorrow. Will l see you? I’m not coming to that ship again. Anything might happen to a girl! - it almost did, you shameless woman! - it’s you taking advantage of my innocence. - You enjoyed it as much as l did. - Shut up! This is the sort of conversation that can colour a young girl's mind. l must go in and get me beauty sleep. Good night. Good night. Good night, Jo! Hey! - Surprised to find me waiting for you? - Not really. - Glad l came? - You know l am. I’ll walk you home. it’s sad to think that once l was a happy young man without a care in the world. Now I’m trapped in a primitive cult. - What's that? Mau Mau? - No, matrimony! Trapped? l like that! You almost begged me to marry you. Did your ancestors come from Africa? No, Liverpool! Were you expecting to marry a man whose father beat the tom-tom? There's still a bit of jungle in you somewhere. (Roars) - l must go home. - You're the boss. Well, goodbye. - Hey! Aren't you gonna kiss me goodbye? - You know l am. Dream of me. Dreamt of you last night. - Fell out of bed twice! - Ta-ra! l love ya! Why do you love me? Cos you're daft! (Laughs) - (Helen) is that you, Jo? - Yeah. Well, you're late. Where've you been? l met a friend. Oh! Well, he certainly knows how to put pink in your cheeks. What makes you think it's a he? l certainly hope it isn't a she that makes you walk around in this enraptured fashion. He's a sailor. Well, l hope you exercised proper control over his nautical ardour. Jo, I’ve got summat to tell you. Jo, I’m gonna get married again. - is it that Peter Smith? - He's the unlucky man, yes. You're centuries older than him. D'you mind? I’m only eight years. What use can a woman of your age be to anybody? Don't talk about me as if I’m an impotent old woman! - You're not exactly a child bride. - l was once. l hope to be dead and buried by the time l reach your age. Just think, you've been living for 40 years! l know. l must be a biological phenomenon! You don't look 40. You look a sort of well-preserved 60. Ooh, you're a cheeky monkey, you are! Anyway, we're off to Blackpool this weekend. You're not leaving me here on me own? You've been on your own before now. Well, I’m coming with you this time. All right, if you want to, love. I’ve got something for you. What is it? A ring! What will your mother say? Don't care what she says. - She doesn't know I’m...? - No. Whatever else she might be, she isn't prejudiced. You're not worried about it, are you? Well, so long as you like it. You know l do. Here, this ring, it's too big. Couldn't wear it for school, anyway. Let's go all romantic. Got a piece of string? Come on, turn out your pockets. Gosh, don't little boys carry some trash? Hey, what's this? - Just a toy car. - Can l try it? Go on, then. (Whirs) No, goes like this, look. l like that. Can l keep it? Take it. My soul and all. Everything! Thanks. l know. l can use my hair ribbon for me ring. Do it up for me. Pretty neck you've got. Glad you like it. it’s my schoolgirl complexion. Oh, l must go home. (Blows horn) - I’ll just go and hurry her up. - All right, love. Hey, aren't you ready? Bert and Doris are waiting. l won't be a minute, love. - You wearing your blue garters? - Oh, stop it. Hello, Daddy(!) You've told her, then. Yes. Now, would you mind going in there and leaving me alone for a minute? What's she all dressed up for? I’m coming with you, Mr Smith. That's right. (Whispers) it was a bit awkward, lovely. - l bought her these chocolates. - Well, give them to her, go on. - Well, here y'are. - Trying to buy me off, eh? Well, I’m still coming with you. Now come on, you two, go in the other room while l finish me toilet. l won't be a minute, really l won't. Make up to him, love, and be nice. He brought you some chocolates! Don't get impatient, Mr Smith. The artwork takes a long time. (Bird twitters) Joey, Joey, Joey! (Clears throat) (Barrel organ plays) Why d'you have a glass eye? Er... l lost one during the war. And can you take that eye out? Don't ask daft questions! D'you wear it when you go to bed? Well, there's one highly recommended way for a young lady to find out. Oh, d'you fancy me? No, thanks. You prefer old women. Well, that's love, innit? - You don't like your mother much, do you? - She doesn't much care for me. I’m not surprised. Hey! You sure you lost that eye during the war? - Are you married? - No, I’m still available. - But only just. How do l look? - Fantastic. Come on. Come on, love, and put your face straight for goodness' sake. (Children chant) Robin Hood and his merry men Went to school and back again The teacher said you're late again...

Jo, this is Doris, Doris, this is Jo. - Come on, get in! - Oh, shut up, you bad-tempered thing! - Looks as though it might be a lovely day. - Hope it stops fine. it’s no more than we deserve. - Well, you're the lucky one, aren't you? - What d'you mean, love? Little lady's big surprise. What d'you think about that? is this for us? Where'd you find it? One of the lads at the club wanted to sell it so l bought it. Oh, isn't it lovely?

For one night, well, actually it was the afternoon, l loved him. I’d never really been with a man before. it was the first time. You can remember the second and the third and the fourth time.

What d'you do at school? - Textile design. - Oh, one of them. Here, l tell you what. I’ll stay here and tidy the place up a bit. Get you a proper meal. 'Ey! Better put that light off. l might be after you! - 'Night, Geoffrey. - Good night. Geoff? Oh, go to sleep! - Geoffrey! - What? You're just like a big sister to me. Hey, you're home early. - Dinner isn't quite ready. Won't be long. - Where is it? In the oven. Hey, get off! (Laughs) - Quite nice, in't it? - Yeah. What's that, a self-portrait? Jo! No! Put your hand up. The other back up. Right. Now keep it. You might have washed 'em first. Don't forget your ears! Oh, Jo went early and it's her half-day. - 'Ey, you seen Jo? - (All) She's up the arches. Hey, I’ve been looking for you. I’ve cooked dinner, don't you want it? - l don't fancy anything. - Well, l haven't poisoned you up till now. l don't want anything to eat. I’m gonna have a baby. Yes, l thought so. - You're in a bit of a mess, aren't you? - Oh, l don't care. You can get rid of babies before they're born, you know. Yes, l know, but l think that's terrible. - When's it due? - About November. - Your mother should know. - Why? You'll have to buy clothes, a cot and a pram... Oh, shut up! I’m not planning big plans for this baby or dreaming big dreams. You know what happens when you do things like that? This baby will be born dead or daft or... You're just feeling a bit depressed, that's all. You'll be your usual self once you get used to the idea. And what is my usual self? My usual self is a very unusual self, and don't you forget that, Geoffrey lngham! I’m an extraordinary person! There's only one of me and only one of you! - We're unique! - Young! - Unrivalled! - Smashing! We're bloody marvellous! 'Ey, Geoff, it's me half-day. How would you like to go to the country? Wonderful! 'Ey, come on! 'Ey, d'you want some chocolate? 'Ey, go on, it's strawberry cream, you like that. Here y'are. 'Ey, what would you say if l started something? - Eh? - What would you do if l started something? - In my condition, probably faint. - No, l mean after. - l don't want you, Geoff. - Well, am l repulsive to you? You're nothing to me. I’m everything to meself. - You need me, Jo. - Let go, you're hurting me! - Will you let me kiss you, Jo? - Oh, leave me alone! (Children shout) (Boy wolf-whistles) Well, l didn't mean to hurt you, Jo. l like you, Geoff. - l like you, but... - Will you marry me? I’m not marrying anybody. Well, just for the baby's sake. I’m going down to the caves. (Guide) When the water reaches the caves, it deposits lime, which forms stalactites on the roof, stalagmites on the floor and covers the walls all over as it is doing mostly, as you can see, in this chamber. The lovely colours are made by iron and copper staining the lime. What was he like, Jo? He wasn't a bit like you. He could sing and dance. He was black as coal. - A black boy? - From darkest Africa. - A prince. - A what? A prince, son of a chieftain. - I’ll bet he was, too(!) - Prince Ossini. D'you love him? l must've. - D'you wish he was still here? - No. - l hate love. - Do you, Jo? Yes, l do. (Guide's commentary continues) God, it's hot! Oh, Jo, stop prowling about. - l feel so restless. - Well, sit down or something. Come on, baby, let's see what big sister's making for us. Oh, Jo, put it down, I’ve just done all that, get off! - l feel like throwing myself in the river! - l wouldn't do that, it's full of rubbish. Here. Read this. When the baby comes, you won't know one end of it from the other. ''Looking after baby.'' ln't that nice(?) ''Third month.'' ''Exercises, relaxation.'' ''Fourth month.'' ''Constipation.'' Drink that and shut up. - l hate milk. - Well, get it drunk. - Does it tell you how to feed babies? - Even you know that. l know about that way, breast-feeding. I’m not having a little animal nibbling at me. it’s cannibalistic. Stop trying to be inhuman, it doesn't suit you. l mean it. l hate motherhood. Well, you've got it coming to you, so you might as well make a good job of it. - I’ve got toothache. - Yes, I’ve got bloody heartache. Got any of that toothache cure? There's only one cure for the toothache and that's a visit to the dentist. (Cuts fabric) Oh... Jo! - How much longer is this going on for? - What? - Your present performance. - You moved in on me, remember? lf you don't like it, get out. But you wouldn't do that, Geoffrey. Got no confidence in yourself, have you? Afraid the girls'll laugh. - You like babies, don't you, Geoff? - They're all right. Would you like to be the father of my baby, Geoff? Yes, l would. l... I’m... l feel stifled in here. - I’m going out. - Well, I’ll come with you. (Children) # All she wants is gold and silver # And a fine young man, you know # On a hill there lives a lady # Who she is l do not know... Can you smell that canal? it’s filthy! - And all those dirty children! - They can't help getting dirty round here. Why d'you stay with me, Geoff? Somebody's got to look after you. You can't look after yourself, that's obvious. # All she wants is gold and silver # And a fine young man, you know # On a hill there lives a lady # Who she is l do not know # All she wants is gold and silver # And a fine young man, you know Do you think there's gonna be a storm? l wouldn't be surprised. l don't think it's doing you any good being with me all the time. l couldn't move away from you now. You must. We can't be together all the time. I’d rather be dead than away from you. You say that as if you mean it. Well, l do mean it. Before l knew you l didn't care much whether l lived or died, y'know. But then l met you and, well, being with you's me life. - (Thunder) - There's no need for us to split up, is there? Come on, rain, come on, storm! Jo? it kicked me, Geoff. it kicked me! - Can l help you, sir? - Yes, l wanted some information, please. Well, me wife's going to have a baby and l wondered if you'd got any leaflets. - To put me in the picture, like. - I’m sure we can do something for you. - When does she expect the baby? - Not yet. A couple of months. Well, perhaps she ought to come down here herself. She's a little bit shy. l expect she'll be along later. Very well. Just a moment, Mrs Walsh. Will you wait here a second, please? (Door opens) l think she ought to have this. She can practise on it. l suppose she's very young. Anyway, you can borrow this and let us have it back when you've done with it. it comes in very handy if she's dubious about handling the baby. There. All right? (Church clock chimes) Look at that little boy over there. He's filthy. And his hair, it's walking away. She shouldn't be allowed. - Who? - His mother. Think of the harm she does having children. Look at that. it’s dead. A bit of love, a bit of lust and there y'are. We don't ask for life, we have it thrust upon us. - Hold me hand, Geoff. - What? - Hold me hand! - Jo! You've got nice hands. Hard. l used to try and hold me mother's hands but she'd always pull 'em away from me. - l like you. - Oh! - D'you like me more than you don't? - Now you're being Irish. Well, a fine Irishwoman you are. Where did your ancestors fall, battle of Salford Town Hall? Me mother's father was Irish. And she had me by an Irishman. The village idiot, from what l can make out. You what? A frolic in a hayloft one afternoon. She said he had eyes like me. - Are you making it up? - No. He lived in the twilight land, my daddy. The land of the daft. - Did Helen tell you all this? - Yes. Yes, l thought so. She likes to make an effect, that one. Well, can you see Helen going out with a real loony? Oh, thanks, Geoff, you're a cure. 'Ey, I’ve got something for you. Well, l got it from the clinic, y'know. l thought you could practise a few holds on it. - The colour's wrong. - What? The colour's wrong! I’ll bash its brains out, I’ll kill it! l don't want this baby, Geoff! l don't want to be a mother! l don't want to be a woman! (Sobs) Jo? What d'you think l can do about it? In any case, bearing a child doesn't put you under an obligation to it. Well, l would've thought it would've done. Well, you've got another think coming. lf she can't look after herself, it's her own lookout. And don't sit there looking as if it's all my fault. Well, it's your grandchild. Oh, you put years on me, you do. She's more than l can cope with, that girl. She always has been. Well, that's obvious. And what part have you got in this little Victorian melodrama? Nursemaid? (Peter) Helen! Helen! Have l got a clean shirt? All right, I’ll come and see her. it’s not my fault. I’ve not known where she's been living these last few months. - Now, don't keep me waiting, l want a drink. - You've had enough. I’m not hanging about in this filthy hole. Wait where you like, then. lf you're not back in ten minutes, I’m going. Oh, suit yourself. (Helen) Jo? Jo! 'Ey, you won't tell her l came and saw you, will you? - Where is she, Romeo? - She's in bed. And what sort of a dump is this? And what d'you think you're doing, hiding yourself away in this chicken run? Lots of girls in your condition have to work and take care of a family. Well, come on, let's have a look at you. You're looking a bit peaky. No wonder. Oh, stop sulking. I’ve brought you some money. it’s taken you a long time to come round to this, hasn't it? - What? - The famous mother love act. Since I’ve known I’ve not been able to sleep at nights thinking about you. There'll be money every week in the post from now on. Until you forget! You walked out the door with that man. You didn't give me a second thought. How did you get here, anyway? I’ll get you for this, Geoffrey lngham! What you trying to run, a back-to-mother movement? - Are you working? - She doesn't like people looking at her. She'd be better off working than living off you like a little bloodsucker. - She doesn't live off me! - No, we share everything. - We're communists, too! - That's his influence, l suppose. You go back to your fancy man! Ooh, I’ll give you such a bloody good hiding! That's what you've gone short of. - Don't show yourself up for what y'are! - You couldn't wait, could you? Now look at the mess you've got yourself in. - I’ll get out of it without your help. - Threw yourself at the first man you met. Yes, l did. - You're man mad. - Like you. Know what they're calling you round here? A silly little whore. They know where l got it from, don't they? Ooh, I’ll knock your bloody head off! - Let me get at her! - Go ahead, go on! Stop shouting at each other, will you! Oh, shut up, we enjoy it. - And another thing... - Hey, hey, what the hell's going on? D'you expect me to wait all day in that filthy street? l told you to wait outside. Don't you wag your bloody finger at me. Oh, hello, then, the erring daughter. (Chuckles) Well, Josephine, you're a big girl now, aren't you? Who's this, the father? Oh dear, no. Who's got a bun in the oven, then, eh? Who's got a cake in the stove? (Laughs) I’m sorry. He's had one too many. Who's coming out for a little drink, eh? What's the matter with everybody? Doesn't anybody want to come out for a little drink? - You get out of here! - Ah-ah-ah! You be quiet. That's right, Mary Ann, you come and have a little drink with me. Who's been giving my money away again? Take your money. Which is the way to the littlest room? Oh, get him out of here, Romeo. That's right, Pollyanna, you lead the way. Ooh! it’s all right, love, l know the district. Like a cigarette? No. Yes, l will. I’ll keep it for later. Jo, why don't you come and live with me? - There's a nice room and plenty of food. - No, thanks. Peter's all right except when he's had one too many. Jo, look, I’m offering you a decent home. I’ll take care of you, I’ll see you through. We're not having that little slut at our place! The house is half mine. Aye, like hell it is. - Oh, take no notice of him. - Now, will you come on? l want this drink! Get him out of here, we'll get our notice! Would you like me to come and stay here with you? No, thanks. Well, I’ll send you some money. And hang on to it, you might need it. We're not having that mademoiselle from Armentiéres living with us! Now, l dragged you out of the gutter once. lf you want to go back it's all the same to me. it’s your own bloody level. And don't you worry about your wandering boy. There's plenty of other fish in the ocean. I’m getting out. - ln't he smashing? - Yes, marvellous, in't he? - Where's Jo? - l saw her going down by the river. Hello. Thinking of chucking yourself in? No. l like it here. - I’ve seen five water rats. - Charming! - D'you still love him? - No. it’s only a dream l had. - Aye, your black prince. - What was his name? - Prince Ossini. - No. it was Jimmie. Oh, well, the dream's gone. But the baby's real enough. Me mother always used to say you remember the first time all your life. - Until now I’d forgotten all about it. - Remember when l asked you to marry me? Yes. it’s not marrying love between us, thank God. You need someone to love you while you look for someone to love. Have you been unhappy with me? Who's happy? As l was going up Pippin Hill Pippin Hill was dirty And then l met a pretty miss And she dropped me a curtsy Little miss, pretty miss Blessings light upon you lf l had half-a-crown a day I’d gladly spend it on you. - Would you, Geoff? - l would. I’d hold your baby in me arms I’d comfort you and keep you We'd climb the hill when the moon was up And we'd sit there till it set I’d hold you tight till the world was done And a daisy grew in my hat! - That doesn't rhyme! - l know, but it's true. You're a funny man, Geoff. l mean that. You're unique. l always want to have you with me cos l know you'll never ask anything from me. - Where you going? - Home. I’m cooking something for tea. (inhales) (# Hums Here Comes The Bride) 'Ey, look at that, in't it marvellous? 'Ere, what you gonna call it? - What, the cake? - Oh, no, the baby, you daft thing! l think I’ll call it Number One. - it’ll always be number one to itself. - You're right. (Helen) Anybody at home? - (Bird twitters) - Well, I’m back. Well, the old place looks more cheerful now, doesn't it? Well, l arrived just in time by the look of things, didn't l? - D'you want a cup of tea? - Hm, you're still here, are you? There won't be much room for two of us around, you know. - Don't you start on Geoffrey! - That's all right, Jo, l don't mind moving out. For heaven's sake, you don't have to wilt away as soon as she barges in. All right, l will have a cup of tea with you. Jo, l got you some lovely things for the baby. Have you got everything packed? - Packed? - Yeah. But I’m not going into hospital. - You're not having the baby here, are you? - She didn't want to go away. She can't have a baby in a dump like this. - The first one can be a bit tricky. - She's been having regular checkups. Don't start frightening her. And what do you know about it? We're not playing at doctors now, you know. (Car horn) l forgot to pay the taxi. Where's me bags? l won't be a minute. Well, she's back, Jo. 'Ey, would you like a bit of cake? No, thanks. You're glad she's back really. No, I’m not. You needn't be afraid of hurting me feelings. God, what am l supposed to say, Geoffrey? it’s you l need, not her. it’s only a choice between two old women. Oh, thanks(!) And of the two I’d rather have you. Well, you'll need a woman with you too. - Someone who's been through it all before. - Oh, stop romancing! l asked you to stay here. Why can't you leave me alone? Now, don't you start upsetting her! l haven't! it’s you, charging in here, trampling on everyone's feelings! I’d have a hard job to trample on yours, son! Don't you ''son'' me! My God, what a travesty of a mother you've turned out to be! Come here to help her, have you? - All you do is put the fear of death in her! - Have you gone mad? Oh, leave me alone, both of you! l can't stand it any more! (Sobs) l just can't stand it! Excuse me. l want a word with my daughter. What's the matter, Jo? Geoffrey's right about you. l wanted you to come back. But when you did it all went wrong again. Why did you want me to come back, love? - l wanted to know what it's like. - What? is there much pain? it’s not so much pain as hard work. But don't worry, love. You've got me now. l can do without you. l can manage. Well, you're very clever, aren't you(?) There's no need for you to be so superior. He's thrown you out, hasn't he? And you had to come crawling back here. Well, it was good while it lasted. - D'you know what l think? - What? l think you're still in love with him. Me, in love? Don't be so daft. What happened? He's just gone off with his bit of crumpet. So we're back where we started. Jo, l forgot to tell you. I’ve ordered a beautiful cot. it’s got lambs and poodles all over it. We've got one. Geoff got it. Bit old-fashioned, in't it? We like it. Now, come on, lie back, love, come on. - You'll be giving yourself a headache. - Do you wonder? Now, come on, have a bit of a rest and I’ll just go and tidy up. - Helen? - What? l want Geoffrey to stay. Understand? Mm. I’m writing her a note. While you're at it, take this thing with you. (Murmurs) What's the matter, Jo? l must have been dreaming. Don't worry, love. Where's Geoff? I’m just going to make you a nice fresh cup of tea, dear. Where's Geoffrey? He's just gone out, love. - Helen? - Yes, love? My baby may be black. You what, love? My baby may be black. Oh, shut up! You'll be giving yourself nightmares. it’s true. You don't mean that sailor was a black man? Yeah. Oh, my God, l need a drink! Well, what you gonna do about it? (Children chant) Guy, guy, guy! Prick him in the eye! Tie him to the lamppost and leave him there to die! 'Ey, in't it marvellous? (Children) Tie him to the lamppost and leave him there to die! Guy, guy, guy! Prick him in the eye! Tie him to the lamppost and leave him there to die! Guy, guy, guy! Prick him in the eye! Tie him to the lamppost and leave him there to die! (Children sing to the tune of # Oh, My Darling Clementine) (Fireworks) Geoffrey! You clown, Geoff! You clown! I’ll make you a cup of tea, love. # Oh, the big ship sails on the alley-alley-o # The alley-alley-o, the alley-alley-o # Oh, the big ship sails on the alley-alley-o # On the last day of September # Oh, the big ship sails on the alley-alley-o # The alley-alley-o, the alley-alley-o # Oh, the big ship sails on the alley-alley-o # On the last day of September # Oh, the big ship sails on the alley-alley-o # Subtitles by Geoff Rowlands Intelfax Media Access
