Is it going to hurt? No, of course not. You might be stiff for a little while, but that's normal. How is it when you talk to them it seems like they're really listening? I... I'm not talking to them. I mean, am talking to them, but it's just to make them feel better. How was your day? Productive. So... Did you come up with any new toys? Well, I'm working on it. But what I did come up with is a surprise for you. A surprise? Before Christmas? Don't worry, there's no obstacles. Okay. It's all good. My gosh, what are you doing? Nothing. We're just out walking. -No peeking. -Okay. -One more step. -Okay. Here you go. All right. Still not looking? -No. -No? I've got a spot. -All right. -All right. Yeah? Yeah, yeah? All right. And... look. What do you think? I love it. Classic. Probably a loose bulb just needs to be tightened. So, listen, I was, you know, thinking now that your apartment is all decked out for the holidays, maybe you'd want to invite your parents over for Christmas? You know, we've been together for a while now, and I'd just really love to meet them. Um... Please hold. I have an extra set of lights. You know, the holidays are a really busy time for my parents, and Christmas is only a couple of weeks away. So, um... But maybe next year, you know? Got it! Whoa. I guess it fixed itself. Yeah. You were right... Just a loose bulb. You understand about my parents, right? Um... I do... Look, there's something really special that I want to do this Christmas, something that I want to ask you. But before I do that, I need to ask your parents, your father, in particular. Are you... Are you saying what I think you're saying? Look, Holly. Holly, I love you. Okay? I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I just want to do it right. I want to ask your dad if it's okay. Wow. Boy, um... Hey... I've got a great idea. You were saying your parents are always too busy, they can't come here. Why don't we go there? No, Connor, they live way, way up north. But you know what we can do? We can screentime them. Wouldn't that be great? No, I kind of want to do it in person. You know, I mean, besides, if we're really ready to take this next step, don't you think it's time I met your parents? Hello-ho-ho. How can I help you? Hey, Uncle Mario. It's Holly. How are you doing, Jingles? I'm great. I'm coming home for Christmas... with my boyfriend, Connor. Hey, Uncle Mario. It's Connor. Well, well, well, won't your parents be tickled! I'd get them on the line, but they're off making sure that the sleigh's flying right. Right, because it's so fast, it's like it's practically flying. Um, speaking of which, can you get Mom and Dad prepared for our arrival and make sure that everything is running... smoothly? You got it, Chestnut. I'll pick you up at the airport. I've got to go... It's time for the elves' cocoa break. Yeah, okay. Uncle Mario, he's such a kidder. Yeah. Morning, boys and girls. Can you guess what I have in here? Any takers? No? All right, this is Fido, all right? And he wants to be your best friend. Yes. Does it make any sound effects? No, but you can absolutely make your own sound effects. Does it come with an app? No, but the great thing about Fido is that doesn't need to be synced up. Put those back on... He's compatible just the way that he is. Does anybody want to play with him? Anybody? You want to... give it a try? Anybody? Okay! Well, that's all we're going to need from you today, boys and girls. Now, there is a docking bay right over there where you can plug in your electronics, and there's some snacks over there in the staff room. Go get 'em! Little rascals. That toy was lame. Stuart, Wesley, Kelly! Well, thanks to Connor here, you can kiss your little Christmas party goodbye because you're all going to be too busy coming up with a better idea than a wooden dog with wheels. I... I got something. Hit me. Um, what about a hunky Santa doll? You know, for the teen market. Um, I think that was my idea. Since when? Yesterday, by the water coolers? I thought you were talking about your date. Yeah, I was. A hunky Santa doll. Yeah. You might have something there. That's more like it. So get busy! So we'll have two stopovers before we fly into Nunavut, and then after that, Uncle Mario is going to pick us up and drive us the rest of the way up north. It's a bit of a trek, but we should make good time in Dad's car. Connor? Your lunch? Right, yeah. Yeah, thank you. Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah, everything's fine. Okay. Way to go, Connor. Yeah, thanks a lot. The Christmas party was my only chance with Deb from accounting. Yeah, in your dreams, Wesley. Dreams can become reality. What's going on? Wegman canceled the Christmas party thanks to me and my toy. Connor. Yeah, I don't know what it is, but I just can't get the kids interested these days. And all Wegman wants is, like, some flash-pan toy like a hulky Christmas Santa doll, and that's popular, you know, in the moment, but it doesn't stand the test of time, not like the toys that I make. Well, maybe you'll get inspired at my parents' place. That him? Yeah! I think that's him. -Can you grab the... -Okay. Uncle Mario! Chestnut! How ya doin'? I couldn't be better. Well, you still look pretty as a snowflake. Although, you know, you could put a little sugar on your bones. Aw... Well, Mario, this is my boyfriend, Connor. Nice to meet you, Mario. Yeah, well, he's, skinny, too. Well, no worries... We got lots of goodies at home to fatten you both up for Christmas. Well, away we go! Geez, you weren't kidding, when you said your parents live up north. So, how long till we get there? It... shouldn't be that much longer. Here, try some of my special hot cocoa. Yes, please. Yeah, it's a home brew. Yeah? It's very hot. Thank you. Smells delicious. Bottoms up. Wow. Mario, seriously. That's, like, some good hock. All right, Jingles. Are you ready to go home? Ready. Wow, Mario, you've sure souped up this ride. You have no idea. Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Whoa. Snowball! Snowball! Whoa, whoa! I'm sorry, we don't get a lot of visitors up here, so he gets a bit excited. Nick. You must be Connor. Yeah. Nice to meet you, Mr. Klaus. Actually, it's "Claus". I could have sworn it was "Klaus". Klaus, Claus, potato, patato... same name, really. Honey, you must be so hungry from that nap. Yeah, wow. Talk about hitting the snooze button. Don't make the poor guy just freeze out here. I am the mother. Come in, come in. -Come on. -All right. There we go. Come on. Get in there, get the chill off your bones. Welcome, welcome. Watch your step here. Come on in. Make yourself comfortable. Wow, this place is amazing. This is all my wife's doing. Wow. You must have the best decorations in town. Well, I should hope so. Would you care for a tour? Are you sure, Dad? There's not much to see, is there? Well, don't worry, I'll give Connor the short tour. Come on, come on. Yeah, yeah, do that one, because dinner's almost ready. Can't keep the ladies waiting. Come on, come on. Lordie, that boy's gonna need some fattening up. Let's go make the beds. I have to admit I was a little surprised to hear that you were bringing Connor up with you. Is this serious? Well, yes, it is. Um... I think he's planning to propose. Propose? Holly... Well, are you sure? I mean, Connor's lovely and everything, but, um... Jack? What about Jack? Well, you always seemed like such a good fit. Plus he knows your family and the business, not to mention he's already prepared. Are you sure that Connor's the one? Yes, Mom. He's everything that I could have wished for. He's kind, and he's generous, and he adores kids. He even makes toys for a living. I've never met anybody who loves Christmas more than he does... besides us. Well... I guess he'll do fine. Hey, come on, Connor, I'll show you the barn. Hey... What do you keep in here? Horses? Something even better. What are those? Those, my boy, are reindeer. For real? You bet. All of them! Whoa. I've never seen reindeer in real life. What do you use them for? Well... We use them for the sleigh! Rides! My parents own a lot of property up here, and they like to give authentic sleigh rides to the visitors. Right, Dad? Something like that. What? I thought you said you didn't get many visitors. Gosh, guys, we are going to get in trouble if we make dinner cold. Chop, chop. Come on. Will you look at that. Wow. So, what we have here now is beef tenderloin with chocolate sauce, sugared carrots, and Holly's favorite dessert, a holiday trifle. Welcome home, darling. Thank you, Mom. Should we wait for your uncle Mario? No, don't worry about him. He's probably just tinkering away on something down in the factory... So I have some good news. I am officially a part of the veterinary team at Secord clinic. Ho, ho, ho, that is something! It is. She's incredible, actually. She just has such a way with animals. That's my girl. And so, Connor, what do you do to keep yourself busy? I work for a toy manufacturer. Wegman's. You guys ever heard of it? Wegman's... I may have. The elves would know... Connor is an amazing toy creator. Aren't you, Connor? Well, I mean, I'd hardly say that. My last idea actually tanked so bad that Mr. Wegman canceled the Christmas party. Well, bah humbug to that! You give me his whole name and I will put him on the naughty list. More carrots? I've got to say, I've never thought to put beef and chocolate together, but that was delicious. You can't go wrong with chocolate. No, apparently not. What is it, Snowball? He wants you to go outside and throw the ball to him. It's his favorite game. Well, in that case, let's go chuck some ball. Whoa, whoa. I need a jacket. Where's Snowball? I need my slippers. Connor took him outside to throw the ball. Did you tell him not to throw it to the back of the house where all the lights are hooked up? Connor! Connor? I brought you some trifle. Thank you. What are you doing? I was seeing if I had any messages from work, but I can't seem to get a signal up here. Well. Hey, did your parents get those lights back up and running? Mario's working on it. I'm sure they'll be back up and running by the morning. I feel like I should go help him. No, no, no, no. Mario likes doing that kind of thing. So I made a great first impression? Of course you did. You didn't know that Snowball was going to go running through those cords. No. Come on. I've got something that I think will cheer you up. Where are you going? Just follow me. Are you sure this is structurally sound? Look. Whoa... What is that? The Northern Lights. The North Pole is one of the best places to see them. The North Pole? This is the North Pole? I told you that, right? I... I could have sworn I told you at lunch... No. No, no, no, you said that your parents lived, like, way, way, way up north. You didn't say they lived this far. Well... Here we are. I hope that's okay? It's okay. No, I love it. It's like there's something magical about it all, don't you think? Yeah, yeah. It's magical. Yeah. I love you, Connor. What was that? What was what? It kind of sounded like a kid. -Connor, look! A shooting star! -What? Where? Whoa! Look at that. That's crazy! I've never seen anything like that before. That was, like, pfff! Well, it's like you said, it's, pretty magical up here. Yeah. Maybe we should go back inside. It's... brrr! Okay. Whoa... Whoa! I'm okay! These lights, Snowball... Yeah, it's not like I had enough to do, no, no. I... I needed to fix the lights, so I really appreciate it. Good dog. Good dog. I tell you, every year it seems the kids wish for more electronic gadgets. Some toys. Listen to this... Dear Santa, I think I've been a very good boy, so I'm wishing for an RX-48 Gaming System, a cellphone, and a tablet. Love, David. Wow. Well, David's got a tall order. Is he on the nice list? Why, yes, he is. -Good morning. -Hi. Well, good morning, sleepyhead. Yeah. Yeah, so sorry. I... I slept late. It must be that fresh arctic air. Pancakes? Yes, please. Don't mind if I do. Frost, my boy! Hello. Nick. Hey-hey-hey! Well, ho-ho-ho! Nice to see you, Jack. Jessica, you are looking as rosy as ever. Very charming. Here you go. Thank you. Hello, Jack. "Hello, Jack"? That's it? I haven't seen you in forever, it seems, and that's all I get? Jack, this is my boyfriend, Connor. Connor, Jack. Boyfriend. Hey. Connor. Nice to meet you. -Yeah. -Wow, chilly hands. You should get some gloves. Well, they don't call me Frost for nothing... Do you hear that? Which reminds me, I brought you a welcome home present. One of your ice sculptures! Yeah, it's a replica of the life-size one I made for Holly on her 16th birthday. Remember, Holly? Beautiful. That was the day you agreed to be my girl forever and ever. that was a long time ago. It wasn't that long. Why don't I just go put this on ice? Yes. So is that your thing, like, ice sculpting? Well, not just ice. Snow too. - Really? - Yeah, yeah. -Wow. -Think fast. - Come... - Jack! Really? Come on, it's all in good fun, right, Connor? Yeah, that came out of nowhere. Well, I can't imagine Holly dating someone that hasn't got a sense of humor. Yeah, you're right. Look at her father. It doesn't get jollier than this guy. I guess not. Jack... It's good to see you. Let me help you out. Okay, see you guys later. He slays me. Holly Claus, I'm surprised at you... Dating someone who can't even catch a snowball. We live down south. He hasn't had a lot of practice. So, what, are you actually serious about this guy? Yes. Yes, I am. I think he's going to propose. You're kidding, right? You actually think Conrad... Connor. ...Connor will fit in to your family? Because, you know, with me, I never had that problem. I mean, in fact, it's what made us a great match... It's what makes us a great match. It's not going to happen, Jack. I'm with Connor now. Okay. We'll see. But I'll be by again soon, Holly. It's good to see you. Everything okay? Yeah, everything's fine. Yeah. So that was the ex-boyfriend? Yes. That was a long time ago. Yeah, well... So he lives here? At the North Pole? Yeah, he's our neighbor. He's probably the closest one... In... In... Not that he's the closest, but in proximity. Yeah. Come on, let's get some pancakes before they get cold. Actually, you know what? There's a little something that I need to work on. Okay. All right. All right. Dear sir... No. Dear Mr. Claus... Mom... Why did you have to tell Jack I was home? Well, I didn't, honey. The little birds told him. You know how those doves do chatter. Well, just so you know, it's over with me and Jack. It was the moment that I left. Well, that doesn't surprise me. That boy would have melted if he'd left the Pole. Well, I mean, that's not why it ended. It didn't work. You understand, right? Yeah, of course I do. Honey, you have not yet told Connor who you really are. I will. And when I do, I think he is going to fit in perfectly. Yeah. Right, Donner? See, Donner agrees. Well, there's a truth. That's settled. Dear Mr. Claus. Mr. Claus, may I have a moment? Just a moment of your time? A word? Your daughter, she's... She's a wonderful person. You know what, she has made me so happy. What I'd like to do is ask for her hand in marriage. Hey, hey, Connor! Hey, Snowball. Nick. Mr. Claus. Hey. Do you have a minute? I will, after I get back from my fitting. Seems I've lost a wee pound or two this year. I'll be back. Milk and cookies in the kitchen. Something special... in the corner. Something special in the corner. Now, ladies, you have got to stop gossiping to Jack about me and Connor. You got it? I know we're friends, but you can't betray my trust here. Jack doesn't get to know everything anymore. There you go. Those birds can't keep their dang beaks shut. Yeah, I'm talking about you. So how are you holding up? You know... It's kind of strange to be here, especially with Connor. Have you talked to him about... No, not yet, but I will. I'm just kind of scared that he... It might freak him out, and then... Maybe just talk to him, and then you'll know. You're right, Mario, I just need to talk to him. Going to tell him right now. Attagirl! Don't mind if I do. Perhaps I'll try a thimble of the sherry. What? Connor? Aah! Aah! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Wha... Whoa! Intruder! What? Wha... Whoa! No! Huckleberries and mistletoe! Don't move. There's got to be some kind of misunderstanding here, okay? What's going on here? Intruder, sir. No, I'm not an intruder. Guys, he's not an intruder. He's my boyfriend. Yeah. Come on, you merry munchkins, untie him. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah... You guys are animals. Thank you. Yeah. All right. Are you okay? I... I mean, I'm fine. I'm fine. What is this place? It's a factory. So, like, when you were talking about how your parents are busy all the time, it's 'cause they run a factory. Exactly. What do they make here? Toys. We make toys. Jumpin' juniper berries! What's all the ruckus? At least let me get the last of the pins out, sir. You have to tell him, sweetheart, before his head explodes. Connor... Um, there's something that I've been meaning to tell you. My parents, they have a very special job. My gosh... Here? North Pole. The toys... Your guys' name? Yeah. Um, I'm Holly Claus, and I am Santa Claus' daughter. Daughter. Father. Mother. Hah! Boy. I'm... I'm so sorry, Connor. I meant to tell you before we left, and I got nervous, and then I was on my way to tell you now, and it's, um... Well, now it's too late, so... Connor, are you okay? I... I need that sherry. Okay, so let me get this straight. These reindeer... are "the" reindeer. Yeah. Donner in there. Vixen. Blitzen, Prancer, Dasher. Dancer, Comet, and Cupid are out to pasture. Rudolph, he takes off right after Christmas, and he doesn't come back again till the next year, like, the night of. It makes my mom so crazy with worry. Okay, so let me get this straight. If you and I get married, my in-laws will be "the" Mr. and Mrs. Santa Claus? Yes. But you can call them Nick and Jessica, of course. Connor, if you're not okay with this, I totally understand. Okay? I'm better than okay. I'm so good! I mean, you... you and your family are incredible. I mean... We're just, you know, we've got issues like every family. No, this is exciting. Okay, what are the chances? Seriously. Me, my absolute favorite time of the year is Christmas. Now this. Fate? No, destiny. Speaking of destiny, I actually... I'm going to marry you, Holly Klaus. Claus. Santa Claus' daughter! Santa Claus' daughter! I'm going to marry Santa Claus' daughter! I'm going to ask Santa to marry his daughter. I... I've got to ask Santa to marry his daughter! What?! That's insane! That's like asking the president or, like, the Easter Bunny. Is the Easter Bunny here? No. No. Okay, good. I need to focus. What am I going to say? What do you mean, what are you going to say? Well, I mean, I've got to convince Santa that I'm worthy to marry his daughter, or else why would Santa let me marry his daughter? Why wouldn't he? He will because I love you. I love you. Okay. Okay. Let's do this. Hand? Let's go. Nick? - Hello. - Sorry. Yeah. Santa Claus. Mr. Claus. Yes. May I have a word? Of course. Come, come, come. Yeah. Thank you. My gosh. Is that the book? It sure is. Have a look. Don't worry, you're on the "nice" list. Wow. What's going on? Shh. He's going to ask Dad. Donny Bartlet? Wow. He comes to our focus groups all the time. He's got a bit of a mouth on him. You sure he should be on the nice list? You learn, in my business, everyone gets another chance. I wonder if Stuart Cuthbert is on there. Yeah... Well, it's taking forever. Look, Connor. You wanted to speak with me? Yes. Yes, of course. Okay. Here it is. Okay. Yeah, I... Mr. Claus... I want you to know that I love your daughter very much. She inspires me. You know, she motivates me. I just can't imagine my world without her. So I wanted to know... would you allow me to marry your daughter? Connor... Welcome to the family. My boy... Holly, Holly, Holly... Yes, yes, yes. Mother... Holly Claus... Will you marry me? Yes! Yes, yes, yes! You two! So it's official. It is. And you've told him, right? I will. Honey... Look, you cannot forget the task at hand. It has been our job as the women in this family to prepare the men for their job as the next Santa. I know. I do. I will. But I would just like to give him a couple of extra days to get used to the idea of all of this first. Fine. But it doesn't mean we can't start working, though. Time is ticking. Absolutely. Tick-tock. So, what are we doing? I think we should see if he could hold his cookies. I mean, after all, on Christmas Eve, he's going to be eating about five billion of them. And a Santa on Christmas Eve with an upset tummy... ooh, is a cranky Santa. So over here is our test area. It's kind of our, quality control. And here's our newest creations. Every year we like to create about a dozen new toys. I mean, you know how it is... Kids, they get tired of their toys, so we like to change it up. What is this? Actually, that's not a toy. It's a contraption I'm working on that warps time and space so when the elves have to go back and do damage control, they can leave the North Pole at warp speed. So how does it work? Well, you just write your address here, and then... but... Actually, it really hasn't been tested... No, don't break it! -Connor? -Yeah? Mom and I were wondering if you could assist us in the kitchen with something. That's a great idea. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Mario, hey. Thanks for the tour, bud. And, sorry about the... the thing. No biggie. I'll fix it. Nice. Yeah. Okay, Connor. Here you go. Those look delicious. Well, we hope so, 'cause, you see, Mom is trying out a bunch of new recipes, and she needs your help testing them for her, right, Mom? That's right. Well, now, there's a job I'll have no problem with. All right, let's get started. Wow. How are you doing, sweetie? Yeah, yeah.... Um, I think I'm full. Hello? A little white dove told me Mamma was baking some of her famous cookies. Darn doves. You always had a real hankering for my cooking. Pff, yeah, only because they're the best cookies this side of the Pole. Okay. Hey, Connor. You're looking a little green, man. Everything okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Yeah, I was just taste-testing some of Jessica's cookies, yeah. Unfortunately I don't think we'll be getting through these. No, no, he'll be fine. He just needs a little bit of a break. Right, Connor? Do you have any antacids? I have a little heartburn. Is this all that's left? Because... No problem. I am Jack Frost, after all. I'll test them for you. Jack Frost? What?! That was tasty. Okay, Jack. These are for you. Try not to eat them all at once. I'll do my best, but no guarantees. Thanks, Jess. Hey, Holly, can I talk to you for a minute? Yeah. Thanks. So, what was that in there? What was what? I see the ring on your finger. You were testing him. You don't know what you're talking about, Jack. Does he even know what he's in for? Wow. Well, all I have to say is good luck. I mean, by the way he failed miserably with those cookies, looks like you've got your work cut out for you. Always nice to see you, Jack. Just remember, Holly... Christmas is the most special day of the year. You don't want to ruin it by giving the job to someone who can't handle it. Right? I'm just saying. I brought you some antacids. Thank you. Jack still here? No. He left. Nice. He's got quite the appetite. I've never seen anything like that. He was just showing off. Yeah? For you or your mom? Connor, you don't have to be jealous of him. I know. I know. It just... kind of seems like he fits in, and... I... You have nothing to worry about, okay? You're going to fit in. I'll make sure of it. Okay. Could you please tell your mom that I might skip dinner tonight? Sure. Thanks again. Only two marshmallows. I need the rest for the smores. Okay. So where's this Connor fellow? I think he's down in the factory. He seems very interested in what the elves are doing. Sounds like he might be better served making toys than being Santa. What? Come on, Jessica. Don't tell me you don't have your doubts. I mean, he's from the south, for goodness sakes. It never gets colder than 30 degrees down there. Now, Jack, we have to give the boy a chance. And I think Holly is going to do a really good job at training him. Yeah, but what if he fails? So I guess congratulations are in order. Yes, thank you. Must be lots to do before the big day? Geez... Speaking of which... Connor, you ever slide down a chimney before? Excuse me? Hol and I used to do it when we were kids, all the time. We had so much fun, remember, Hol? Yeah, I've slid down a few banisters in my day. Well, then, you shouldn't have any problem at all with a chimney. What do you say we give it a go? Is it always this windy? Yeah. It's the North Pole. Ho, how are you, my girl? I thought I'd have myself a quick read. What? Nothing. Don't tell me "nothing". I know you. Tell me. What, what? It's all good. You'll see. Good news, though... it's really hot in the chimney. Think you can handle the heat? Yeah. I can handle the heat. We'll see about that. Here goes nothin'. Ooh! Jack! Just doing a little chimney sliding, Nick. Jack... Such fun. All right, buddy, you're up! Yeah, yeah, I'll be right down. Wow. Connor, you don't have to do this! Don't worry, I got this, babe! What are you kids up to? Yeah. Yeah... Whoa! Aah! Connor? Hello! Are you all right? Yeah, yeah. Just a little stuck, I think. Well, pull your shoulders together and suck it in. Yeah, still not working. I got you, buddy... use the ol' poker trick. -Jack, Jack! -What? Not helping. Relax, everyone. I'll... I'll melt the butter. My. Are you sure you're okay? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. I just, you know, came down on a wrong angle... or something. Okay. It was a solid effort, Connor. You're a good sport. Yeah. How's it going? Hey. It's okay. Um, listen, about today... Yeah. Yeah, that went well. Yeah... Listen, that was my own stupidity, like, thinking I could actually slide down a chimney. It's not like I'm your dad or anything. What I should be able to do is make a toy that kids actually want to play with. But for whatever reason, I don't know what to do to make it better or more fun or whatever it is I've got to do to this thing to make it more interesting to kids. I guess I could make an app or add some lights or something, but that's kind of like, plffft! You know, once my dad gave me a doll, and it was kind of an ugly doll, to be honest. It was one of the elves' prototypes, and it didn't quite work out. And I didn't want to play with it, and so it just sat on my bedroom shelf for months and months. And then one day I spilled hot cocoa and I got the doll's dress dirty, and so I picked her up and I started cleaning her. And the moment that doll was in my hands, it was like magic. I cleaned her, I dressed her, and for the first time, I played with her, and from that moment on, she was my most favorite doll. So, you see, sometimes you just have to get the toy into the child's hands for them to realize how wonderful it is. You'll get it. Thanks. My, Mr. Claus smells something yummy from Mrs. Claus' kitchen. Ho-ho, good morning, dumpling. Where are the children? Holly is out feeding the animals, and I have Connor chopping firewood. Ooh. Nicholas, do you have any, you know, concerns about Connor's abilities? I mean, when I first met you, you at least could polish off a couple dozen of my cookies. Well, I always had a good appetite. But we still had our doubts about me. Like when you forgot to harness the reindeer and they took off without you. You sure whipped me into shape. And Holly will do the same for him. Besides, the boy has plenty of Christmas spirit. That will get him through. I don't know. Look. I tell you what. I'll think of a task I'm sure he can do. Okay. Don't touch that... Boy. Connor, my boy. Just stacking some wood. Don't worry about that. I've got another job for you. Job? What kind of job? Well, the elves are having their siesta, but I need some toys. I was going to get Connor to go down to the factory and fill this up while I get some work done in the office. I could do that. Um, actually, I need your help in the office, you know what I mean? Just get what's on the list, and make sure to be very, very quiet so you don't wake up the elves... Or else they'll get real cranky. Got it. Don't wake up the elves. Good man. There we go. Yeah! I think he's got this in the bag! Hey! Aw! Heave, ho-ho-ho! Heave, ho-ho-ho! Heave! Good. Pull, Santa, Pull. You sure these are the right size? Yes. Whoo. Whoo. Robin, you're the best. I know. You're looking very sharp for the big day, Snowball. What? No. I haven't told him yet, but I will. I mean, there's no rush. We haven't even set a date yet. Rush what? Um... I was... I was just telling Snowball that, now that we're engaged, that we don't have to rush getting married. We can take our time and set a date and plan, and... You know, actually, I was thinking maybe we could... we could do that sooner rather than later. Sooner... Okay, well, the summer is always nice. And the... The fall would be beautiful, with all the leaves... I was actually thinking this Christmas. This Christmas? Yeah. Why not? We're already here, your family's here, Mario, the elves... Plus your dad will be done delivering all the presents. He can kick back, have an extra egg nog or two... But what about your parents? Well, first of all, my parents are in Florida vacationing, like they do every Christmas. Second of all, they eloped themselves, I already talked to them on the phone, and they're great with it. Is that your holiday stew? Yes, it is. A couple bowls of this has kept your father going all Christmas for almost 30 years. I thought a bowl or two might help Connor along. Yeah. Yeah. Um, speaking of Connor, we have set a wedding date. You did? When? Christmas Day. Honey, that gives us plenty of time... Christmas Day this year. Good golly gumdrops, Holly Claus! That's in less than a week! I know, but he was just so excited about being here, and us being here, and... So he already knows? Actually, I wanted to give him a little bit more time to... Holly, really... Mom, please. I just think that if can complete one task, he's going to feel a lot better about this. Well, let's see if he could handle... the sleigh. Perfect! Except, for now, let's keep the reindeer out of it. Right. All right, these new hydraulics should take some of the load off the reindeer so you can get to where you need to go faster. Ooh! You guys needed me? Yeah, um, sweetie, Mario just added hydraulics to the sleigh. To ease the load. And we were hoping that you might test-drive it for us, considering you probably know a little more about this than Dad. Yeah, I'm used to using reindeer dust. Absolutely. Yeah, I used to build go-karts when I was a kid. I got this. Climb aboard, captain. Okay, so, what have we got? These ones start it up. This one gives it the lift. But right now, you just want to ease it out of the barn in a hover. You got it? Got it. All right! Good man, good man. Here we go. That was festive. Good tune! Yeah! Attaboy, attaboy. Sounds good. -Yeah. -Yeah! It sounds like it's warmed up. So now, just go up into a hover. -Here I go. -Here you go, here you go. Nice and easy. I... I don't know what happened. Everything was good... Mario? Duct tape. Here you go, Donner. That's enough, Thistle. Good night, now. Hey. Can Mario fix the sleigh? He'll set it right. Dad, do you think Connor can do it? Now, now, now, let's have none of that talk. But he hasn't been able to finish a single task. Holly... I flunked rooftop parallel parking seven times. My first chimney slide, I landed smack in the fire, singed my "South Pole", couldn't sit down for a week. Darlin', if I can do this, have faith he can. Hey, Holly? I think I might need some aspirin. What about you? You know where the aspirin is? Hey there, partner. Looking for these? Nice catch. Yeah. Thanks. So, from what I hear, the big day is right around the corner. Yup. Bet you never thought you'd be in the shoes you're in. No. Some pretty big shoes. Wow, that's an understatement. I mean, how many people can say they're marrying Santa's daughter? Just me. That's right. Just you. You're the one. That's right. And it's just you taking on that big, red, jolly responsibility too. That's right. Gee, I'm sorry, I don't really know what you're talking about. Just the whole Santa legacy thing. I mean, you can't tell me you're not just a little bit freaked out about the idea of becoming Santa, right? Wow. She hasn't told you, has she? What?! Well, this is awkward... for me. Okay, so, what you're saying is that, because I'm marrying Holly, I'm actually next in line to be Santa? That's about right. Hit the nail on the head. Why wouldn't she tell you? You know? Yeah, of course, I guess she could have her reasons, like... maybe in her heart she knows you're not cut out for the job? Look, I'm... I'm sorry. Forget I said anything, all right? You're a good man, Connor, okay. And I'm sure you understand that Christmas is the most magical day of the year... which is why I know you wouldn't want to spoil it for generations to come. Right, buddy? Feel better, bud. Ooh! Hey, Snowball. Okay, I'll take care of that. We need some aspirin... Actually, I already took care of it. You did? I think I should just go check on him anyway. It's okay. He was almost asleep. Poor guy. Really? That arctic air is really knocking him out. Yeah. So why don't you just let him rest? Let's say we have a cup of cider? I really should... I'd love some cider. After a day like this, I'll take two cups. All right. Then we'll all raise a glass? I... I really should, um... -Come on. Yeah! -Okay. All right. So we snuck out around midnight, without waking any of the elves, and then we pushed the sleigh out of the barn. Holly bribed the reindeer so they'd help us out and keep quiet. With candy apples. That's right, with candy apples! So we pushed the sleigh far enough away that when we took off, you guys wouldn't hear us. You're such rascals! Well, it didn't hurt that we gave you hot cocoa! That's right. Where did you two fly to? We went all the way to the top of Snowy Ridge. It was beautiful. You always could handle the sleigh, Jack. Well, I had a great co-pilot. -Ooh. -Aw. I'm about ready for a top-off. How about we do some Christmas caroling? You guys used to do some caroling. What was one of the songs you used to sing? you mean this one? ♪ It came upon the midnight clear ♪ ♪ That glorious song of old That's the one. Come on, Holly. - Join me up here. - No. Join in. -No, I don't want to. -Come on! Honey, we haven't heard you sing in so long. This is true. Come on. All right. ♪ From angels ♪ Bending near the earth ♪ To touch their harps of gold This is wonderful! ♪ It came upon the midnight clear ♪ ♪ That glorious song of old ♪ From angels bending near the earth ♪ ♪ To touch their harps of gold ♪ This is nice. Yeah. ♪ Peace on the earth ♪ Goodwill to men ♪ From Heaven's all-gracious king ♪ ♪ It came upon the midnight clear ♪ ♪ That glorious song of old ♪ And all the world ♪ Give back the song ♪ Which now the angels sing What a lovely evening. Thank you, Jack. Aw. You know... There's no place that I'd rather be. I'm going to go check on Connor. All right. Good night, Jack. Yeah. Good night. Night. Good night, Jack. Thanks for the memories, old friend. Thank you guys. Safe home. ♪ Holy night ♪ All is calm ♪ All is bright Connor, sweetie? Are you okay? Dear Holly, The first day I laid eyes on you, I knew I'd be a lucky man if you ever gave me a second glance... because not only were you the most beautiful girl in the room, but you were the most radiant. But I took a chance, and when I did, not only did you give me a second glance, but one of the most magical nights of my life. I know I've told you before, Holly, but I fell in love with you that night, and nothing has come close to that moment until the day you said yes. I love you, Holly... and I'd do anything for you, which is why I'm saying goodbye... because you deserve someone who will take the reins and fill your father's boots in a way that I'll never be able to, and I cherish Christmas too much for that. And I love you even more. Merry Christmas, Holly. Love always, Connor. Craftsmanship nowadays... You think this is real funny, do you? What is it, Jingles? I was... I was going to tell him, you know... prepare him. But I guess he found out and panicked. But that's not the worst of it. The worst of it is that I doubted him... I doubted if he was up for the job of being Santa... which is terrible, because... I love him. I guess if I had kept the faith and not fallen into doubt, he would still be here. Chestnut, there was nothing you did. This is on him. And destiny. And if it was meant to be, the stars will align, and believe me... he'll be back. What if that doesn't happen? Well... you'll still be all right. I just got a huge order for hunky Santa dolls. Yes! Merry Christmas! Hey. Yeah. I heard what happened, and that's lousy. I mean, a Dear John letter? I mean, at least be man enough to tell you to your face, right? I guess that's why he's not cut out for the job. What do you want, Jack? What I've always wanted. You. Really, Jack? Now? Now is a better time than never. I can't lose you again, Holly. You've got to know it... We're meant for each other. Your dad knows it, your mom knows it. You've got to know it. I mean, think about how much fun we all had together the other night. Right? And there's no doubt that I'm the man for the job. I... Just think about it. That's all I'm asking. Wow. That's quite the piece of ice you got there. Jack gave it to me. He asked me to marry him, in so many words. Well, can't say I'm surprised. I guess you think that's a good idea? He would make a great Santa. I don't think anything other than wanting my little girl to be happy. And does he? Does Jack make you happy? I don't think it matters, does it? You know what I love best about being Santa? The look on those kids' faces when they open up a present they've been wishing for all year. The twinkle they get in their eyes... The flush of pink to their cheeks... The feeling of pure joy. Now, you tell me, does it matter if he makes you happy? Connor! Surprised to see you here, buddy. I thought you would have taken off for the holidays. Yeah, I decided to come back, you know, get some work done. Yeah, well, thanks to my new hunky Santa doll, Wegman's throwing us another party. Yeah, but don't worry, you don't need to stick around. Don't do us any favors, okay? So I was thinking of a sexy Santa doll to go with the hulky Santa doll... -I need a focus group! -What? Focus group. I need one. No, no, no, no, Connor, not now. Can't you see? You know... Besides, all you've got is that weird dog thing, and it was a flop. That's right, Connor, the dog with wheels. Yeah. Wheels are turnin'. Mr. Wegman, trust me. I got something. Holly? Hey! It's me, Jack. You wanted to see me? That's what I'm talkin' about. You're the man, Jack. That's right. All you've got to say now is "I do," and this will all be yours. Ho, ho, ho! All of you are naughty. So that's what this has always been about? Wh... Holly, baby. I was just trying it on. And guess what? Fits like a glove. Just as I said... we're the perfect match. Don't try to get yourself out of this one, Jack, 'cause I get it now. I mean, I can't believe it took me this long to see it. This... This is what you've always wanted. Not me. Holly, please. How can you say that? It's only ever been about you. I mean, look at us. We've been a team since we were kids. I love you. You know what, if actually cared, I might try to believe you. But I don't. Holly. Come on, of course you care. You're Holly Claus. The most important thing in the world to you is Christmas. So, really, if you care about Christmas, you care about us. You're right. I do care about Christmas. I knew it. So, what do you say? Shall we make this official? All right. I'm officially taking over the role of Santa. What did you say? I'm going to do it. I'm going to do the job. That's... That's golden. Man... You, as Santa, with the belly... and the beard! I'm serious, Jack. Why not? As long as the job gets done. And I know I can do it. Don't be ridiculous, Holly. I should be Santa. Not you. I mean, come on. Do you know how many years I've been working towards this, with you and your family? Do you know how many of your mom's cookies I've had to choke down over the years to get here? I thought you loved my cookies. Of course I love your cookies, Momma. I was just saying that... Save it, Jack. And do me a favor. Take off the jacket. And don't call me "Momma". You're making the biggest mistake of your life. I'll take that chance. So... You are going to follow in your father's footsteps? I'm going to try. You think Dad will be okay with it? Given that you're your father's daughter, I think he'll be just fine. This is going to be weak. Hey, boys and girls. Listen, have I got a toy for you, okay. Now, this toy... the batteries will never, ever, ever run out. You'll never have to charge them. Okay, this toy will stand the test of time, okay, and it will be with you for as long as you're willing to take care of it. This toy... ...is Fido. This is ridiculous! Come on, give the kid one of my hunky Santa dolls. Or try one of my hunky Santa dolls. Okay, for the last time, it was my idea, okay? So drop it. Not even. Look, yes, it was. Meet Fido. By the way, a winky face means nothing. It just makes you look like a stalker. Hey, can I have a turn? Hey, this is cool. -What is it? -It's a toy dog! I like its ears. Yeah, he looks really cool. -Wow! -Wow, I love it. Brilliant, Connor, just brilliant. Work with me. That was one heck of a presentation. Holy Dinah. And I've got to say, Connor, this whole time, I knew you had it in you. Wesley! -I'm right here, Mr.... -Geez! Wesley, let's get this toy ready to roll out into production, ASAP! Got it. And let's cut the order of hunky Santa dolls in half. I want to double up on Fido. No. Really? I am so sorry your idea didn't pan out, Wesley. Okay, so much bickering. Let's go. Back to work. The classic toys are back! Whoa, Connor... A little success has given you quite the appetite. That's a lot of donuts. Ha! I can do it! You can do it? Look, I can do it! You can do it. Do it! I can do it. I did that! Cookie break is over. Back to work. Aww! Ho, ho, ho! How can I help you? Mario? Hey, it's Connor. How you doing, Sasquatch? Listen... Merry Christmas, Stuart. Hey, can you pick me up at the airport? Hey, you bet your tinsel I can. Awesome. Yes! Listen... Um... I'll see you after the next flight. You got it! Yeah. The stars have aligned. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas, everyone! Ho, ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Whoo! Merry Christmas, sir. All right, Donner, seeing as I'm going to be the one holding the reins one day, I should probably get some practice in? Well, thank you. I appreciate the vote of confidence. I think I can do it too. I just wish I didn't have to do it alone. You don't. Connor! Holly, I am so sorry. It's okay. No, it's not okay. I should never have left you like I did. I should have talked to you first, 'cause that's what couples do, right? They talk it out. And if I would have done that, then maybe I would have realized that the reason I wasn't succeeding was because of my confidence, my lack of it. Connor, I never wanted to put that kind of pressure on you... which is why I waited to tell you, because I was... I was afraid. And I totally understand if you don't want to... No, no, I do. I want to do it. I can, Holly. You watch me. Here I come! -Whoa! -Whoa! My, my, my! And remember, a busy elf is a happy elf. Ha, ha, ha! All right, Ewing, loading it up. Yeah! With the legs... Yeah. Ho, ho, how do I look? Honey, well, you're a little skinnier than last year, but otherwise pretty perfect. Rudolph just rolled in. Thank goodness. He always gets here at the last minute. All right. Now we're all here, I guess it's time to get this show on the road. Connor... You'd best get a jacket or something. It gets a bit chilly up there. I'm sorry, where? In the sleigh. You're coming with me, aren't you? I mean, you need at least a few practice runs. Yes, sir. I mean, Santa. Yeah, absolutely I'll go up there with you. Then let's do this. Ha, ha, ha! Whoo! Come on, everyone! My favorite night of the year! Now, I packed some extra socks... I've got extra socks. And some little snacks, and I've got a lunch for you... I don't need lunch. I'll be eating cookies all night. Okay, okay. Bye-bye, bye-bye. Good night. -Have a good time. -Yeah. -One more. -Aw. Are you all right? Yeah. No, I'm better than all right. I'm great. Hop in, Connor. There's plenty of room. Room for two? Because this generation of Clauses is going to do it together. Really? Yeah. That's my girl. Come on, come on. There's my girl. You look right at home there, Connor. Now, will you both do the honors? On... Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen! On Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen! And you too, Rudolph! Yeah! To the top of the porch, to the top of the wall! Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all! Bye! Merry Christmas! Here. Whoo! Whoo! And... Merry Christmas!
