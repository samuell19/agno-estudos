- Alright young lady, you ready? - Is it good? - Oh stop it! Mm-hm, what's this? - I know it, thank you. - What do you mean, you know it? - Hey, look who's here for you! Ta-da, Bobby is here. - Hey, no, no, you're too young for this. - What's going on? - It's an emergency at the hospital. Do you really have to shoot everything? You'll stay with your father for a little while, okay? - Mom, you promised me. - It's just you, me, and Bobby, we'll have fun, Emma. Oh, come on sweetie. I've got something for you, surprise! - Ta-da! - Ta-da! - Hi, I'm Charlie. - I'm Buster! - Look over there, ah! Okay then, there's only one rule. - Do you guys need a lift? - We'll take taxi. - Sorry, can I use the toilet please? Sure, I'll show you. - Thank you. - Are you Charlie? - Yes sir. - May I ask you... Shut up you little faggot, or I'll make a fucking hole in your head. - What do you want? - I want you to entertain my baby-arm. Jerk me off quick and I swear I'll let you go like nothing happened. - Emma Wallace, is this what you wish for? - What the fuck is going on? - Ah right, you don't do such things. - Dickheads. A copybook please. - Let me check. - Hey, hey, your copybook. - Students of Italian Cinema, please can you come with me. - Come on, you pussy! Even your granny is better than you. - What the hell are you doing? What the fuck is going on here? Tell me or I'll make you smoke all... - Nice one! - Hey! - Do you even know how fun you can have too with a butt like that? - Fuck you! - Can I wish you a happy birthday? Come on, please, please! - Alison, no. - But it's your birthday. - You know I hate it. - What if I told you I managed to persuade Matty? - Are you insane? - I told him this time you're willing to do anything. See this as a second chance. - Open your books at chapter 12. In 1864, Peter Waage and Cato Guldberg pioneered the development of chemical by formulating the law of mass action. Elementary reaction follow the law of mass action, but the rate law of stepwise reaction has to be derived by combining the rate law of the various elementary steps In 1901 he was awarded by the first Nobel Prize in recognition of the extraordinary services he has rendered by the... Emma Wallace, what happened? - Tina, cut it out! - It's not she who's an expert in cuts. - Idiot. - Hi. Emma. Emma. Emma. - I'm here. - I'm sorry for that. - It's okay. - No worries, I'll take care of it. But there's something I have to do first. - No way! - Come on, I already told her you'd come too. - She may be a real hottie, but that girl is nuts! - You owe me. I know your dirty secret. - I don't get what you see in her. - Maybe I'm out of my mind. But she's still my friend. - She needs help. - She has a crush on you, and she wasn't ready that time. - She almost bit my lip off. - Mm, hm, look, you are the only reason that will make her come to that party. I want a party pack, and some benzos tablets for a friend. Ugh. A-ah. - I'm back. Mom? Hey bitch! - Jiminy Cricket told me there's a party tonight. - So, are you going to go there? - Hm, You know I love parties but the weirdo's one? I'd rather not. - Hm, other plans? - Have to upload that video. - Wait, what? - Veronica, hurry up! We have a pizza to order. - You haven't got off your phone since we got here. - Just a minute, I'm working for you. - What's wrong with you today? - Throwing you a party ain't that easy. It's not like you have lots of friends. - What part of "I don't celebrate my birthday", don't you get? - You talk like it's some sort of curse. Why don't you pick up? Keeping on hating him won't bring your mother back. You're not a child anymore. This is your chance to try and reconnect with him. - I really don't think so. - Maybe he misses you. - I liked you more when you were texting in silence. - Dammit, I know every single one of your secrets. You saw me naked and drunk, we even kissed, but you have never, ever, told me anything about your family. Tell me, that's why you got held back in school, right? - Why do you keep going on and on about this story? - Emma! - Maybe he misses you? - Emma, Emma. Emma. Oh Emma. - Emma? Emma, what's the matter? - It was like a daydream nightmare. - I'd better not to give you that dope. - Sorry, I gotta go. Leave. - Emma. - I said leave! - We need to talk. Just give me a few minutes. - Leave, or I'll call the cops. - I just wanna tell you what went on that day. It was a really nice day. - I give you five minutes. - Where do I start? - You've two left. - It's not easy. - I'll help you out. Tell me what the fuck happened that fucking day! - It, it was an accident. - Get out! Get out! - I'll explain everything but please calm dawn! I don't even recognize you anymore. - You know, it happens when you abandon kids. - Do you remember those two clowns? - Are you actually asking? - Well, after the party there was a fight. I had a few drinks. Trust me, the shot was fired by accident. Emma, I need you to believe me on this. - It was two shots. - I was stressed. I was stressed because of my job. And on top of that, your mother had just got sick. - Do not mention her. - I swear to you there hasn't been a second I did not regret it. That's why I'm back. To tell you I'm gonna turn myself in. But I wish that you forgive me first. - You have to leave now. - Emma. - Time's up. - Okay, if you change your mind, know that I stay at the Park Hotel. I'll wait for you. - Hey, I saw your call. What, no, no, no, no, no, no you can't do this to me! But we had a deal, I need the house tonight. I don't give a fuck about administrative problems. - All right young lady, you ready? - Is it good? - Oh stop it. Mm-hm, what's this? - I know it, thank you! - What do you mean you know it? - Hey, look who's here for you. Ta-da, Bobby is here! - Hey, no, no, you're too young for this. - Ah! Emma, Emma? We're coming for you. Tell your friends to join us. - What there fuck do you want? - Matty please, you have to help me. - And you are? - Don't mind her, she's leaving. - You say I'm a weirdo, I mean look at you! - Fuck you! You know, you should try to fuck every now and then, bitch! - Matty? - Let's play a game! - Ah! - You like it? - Ah! - You like it? - Ooh. - I need some company. - Why the fuck would you do that? Ginger, you're such an asshole. Come on, delete it now. I don't want that sleaze of my mother's boyfriend to see that. - Considering the notoriety of the video, your stepfather would be drained already. - It's not funny. - Yes it is. - Can you please help me out and delete it? - I'm not the boss here. - I mean, according to pussywagon63, I'm the ping pong queen. - Wow. - Are you sure? Usually they ask me to strip. - I don't give a fuck about what they ask you. Go to the bathroom and get dressed! And move on! - Bitches. Tina, you should come up with something better. And you Veronica, make sure to tidy it all up. - I've worn a lot of weird stuff, but this... - Shut up! If you want to open up to somebody, do it with my cock. - Stop this shit, I wanna fuck. - Bha, ha, bha! - Lucky them. - You say something, babe? - Nothing, keep trying with cold water. - Oh my god, what happened to you? - Allison, you have to help me. - You did it again? Dammit, you did it again! I could kill you for that! - Woo! - I told you not to. - I cared for you to celebrate. - I have to leave. It's not safe for me here. - Emma, wait. I'm sorry, I didn't know it really mattered to you. - Allison, I've nowhere to go. There's a problem with my mother house and... - Shh, this should've been my present for you, but I know how to fix this. My father owns a homestead in the countryside, but he never goes there. If you want, I can tell you where he keeps the spare key. - Yes, yes, yes! - Okay. - Is it good? - Oh... - We're coming for you! Me, you, and Bobby. - Emma? - Allison? - Hi Emma. Remember me? I do remember you. We made sure you had a great time. Now it's your turn to take care of us. Buster, what do you smell? - Flesh! - Say cheese. - Rar! - See, we haven't changed at all. - At all. - And do you know why? - Why? - Ask your father. - Oh father. - Forgive him, he was a weird guy when still alive too. - By alive, he means before your father did this to me! - You're not real! You're just a creation of my mind! - Blah, blah, blah. - Maybe you didn't quite grasp the psychology book. - You still sure we're not real? - Bitch! - Emma, relax, it's me! - What are you doing here? - What? - I couldn't believe it. It was so real. - You read this junk? I'd rather tabloids or a magazine full of hot men. - Allison! Leave! - Absolutely not! - Please, they could come back. - They, who? - I don't want you to get hurt. - Emma, what do you mean? - You don't understand. - Can you explain to me what's with you, once and for all? - It's complicated. - At least try. I canceled an entire party for you! - Do you really wanna know? - Yes! - On my tenth birthday, my father killed two clowns in front of me. Since that day, I've started suffering from a sort of clown-phobia. I keep seeing these two clowns but it only always happens on my birthday. But today was different. It seemed like I established a connection with them. - Right, let's talk about something more serious. - It's what I tried to explain. - Emma, what's going on? - Come on Emma, it's your chance. - Kill her, kill her, kill her. - Kill her! - Kill her. - Kill her. - Kill her. - Kill her. - Kill her, kill her. - Kill her. - Kill her. - Kill her. - Kill her. - Kill her. - Kill her. - Kill her. - Kill her. - Kill her. - Kill her. - Kill her. - Kill her. - Kill her. - Kill her. - Kill her. - Kill her. - Kill her. - Kill her. - Emma, please, let's leave. What are you doing? - Trust me. - Please. - No, don't listen to her! It's all her fault after all. She's the one who threw the goddamn party. - She's the one who rang your father! - Just like her father, you're a fucking genius. - Was he like this? - Make sure you shoot a nice scene here. This one a one take. - This is a masterpiece. - A masterpiece! - Emma! - I'm sorry. Bobby, you're late. Are you drunk? - No - You smell like beer. Nice job. Here comes the hardest part. Come on. You have just to stab me. Are you having second thoughts? - Course not. - Then what the fuck is wrong with you? - Uh, I was just wondering, why? - Look, if you do it, I'll allow you to fuck my dead body. - What about the money instead? All right, I'll get the job done. - I changed my mind. - Are you Charlie? - Yes, sir. - Shut up you little faggot or I'll make a fucking hole in your head. - What the fuck is going on? - What do you think, Buster? Do you like my new look? Charlie, you are the best.
