"I had a dream, which was not at all a dream. The bright sun was extinguished... and the stars wandered, sparkling in the eternal space. Rayless, and pathless... the icy earth swung blind and black in the moonless air. Morning came and went, and came, and brought no day..." LORD BYRON The Darkness One... two, three, four... five, six, seven... eight, nine, ten... eleven, twelve, thirteen... fourteen, fifteen! Ready or not... I'm coming. I heard some voices in the bathroom! Found you! And now, who's next? Me. It's time to sleep. It's time to sleep now. Go ahead, Luciana. Argel... Argel. I have something to tell you. What is it? I'll tell you when I come back. Marcos! Let's go. What are you doing? Go back to your bed. Back off. Back off, Luciana! I told you to back off! Are you OK? Argel... Dad... Where is Marcos? It took him. THE DARKNESS Did you find him? No. Did you see It? Cook the meal. How do you know It took him? What are you waiting for? Take it away. I want to go with you. You know that's not possible. - I want to go with you. - Argel. I want to go with you. Argel... I want to go! Argel! Sit down. Serve your sister. The pain relief is... often... immediate... when the ban- bandage... is correct- correctly... applied... if there's no relief or the pain increases... that would... mean... that the bandage... was... applied... excessively tight. The well-being of the victim... is not the only purpose... it is also a good sign that... that the bandage... has... been... correctly app- app-applied. Dad? Why did It take him? What does It want? Marcos walked away from me. It was his fault. I don't want to read anymore. Never go outside alone. As you can see, it is dangerous. Come. It's time to sleep. Look... She's Mom. Where is she? I don't know. Do you want it? She's asleep. Argel... What? It's in his room. What? What's in his room, Luciana? The darkness. Cook it. There's no water left. Argel... Argel! What is it? It's coming... Dad! Dad! I'm here. Don't make any noise. Put your mask on. We are going to follow It. - What are you waiting for? - I can't find my mask. Look for it. It will escape. I don't know where it is. It's gone. Tomorrow, you're coming with me. We'll be close. It's going to be OK. Dad? What's that? A car. What is it for? For nothing. Did you find what you were looking for? Where? In my room. - What were you looking for? - Nothing! You know it's forbidden to go in there. Don't ever try it again! Wait for me here. Dad. Luciana! Luciana! It's me. It's OK. What happened? Who entered? Look what I found... It's for you. I saw two people today. We are not alone. No. I'll go find them. Maybe they saw Marcos. Why doesn't she come up? She's not hungry. She's sick again. Thank you. Asphyxiation... Is divided into three general categories... Wake up. There's nothing in his room. You didn't go. Marcos is never coming back. Marcos! Marcos! Marcos! Marcos? Where were you? Don't be scared. We are not going to hurt you. Take off your mask. You don't need it. What are you doing here? My brother... We saw him. How do you know it was him? There's no one else here. He didn't believe us either. Where is he? We are going to take you to him. Yes. But we need to eat something first. Back off! We are friends. They are with me. What are you looking for? We're just looking for some food, good man. Go away. Have mercy on us. We must help them. Shut up! There's no need to be like that... Turn around and leave. Liar. There's no need to be angry. I told you to go away! Please... We just want something to eat. You are a good man. You eat and you leave. God bless you. Amen. It's been a while since I had a banquet like this. Did you cook it, son? You have a gift. Look... They are asleep. Dad... They saw Marcos. You have to go, it's late. How do you know? What? That it's late. They stay. No... we are leaving. We don't want to cause any trouble. Drop the gun or I'll kill her. No! Please don't! How is she? She hasn't awoken yet. What are we going to do with him? Wait until It takes him. It will come back. Argel... Luciana... Luciana... Luciana! Where are you going with that? You know it's forbidden. It's for Luciana. Dry yourself off. What's your name? Where do you come from? Get dressed. Where did you see Marcos? She won't talk. It's late, tie her up. Argel... I can take you to him. Argel, tie her up! Where were you? Wait. Argel... How did you get in? - How did you get them? - Let's go. Argel... What's that? Don't make any noise. What are you doing? Downstairs! Give'em to me! Calm down. It's OK. Argel! Dad what are you doing? Leave her! Dad... No! Please don't! Please don't! Please! Get out of here! Argel! Marcos is dead! I told you so... Argel... Argel... Argel, son... Calm down... Calm down. No. He's not dead. Marcos is not dead. Argel, calm down... Calm down... He's not dead! No! Marcos! Marcos! Marcos... Argel! Argel! - Argel! - Let's go. Where are you going?! Luciana! Leave her! Argel, please! The Beast is going to find you! Don't leave me! Don't leave me here! Open! Argel... Don't move. Don't move! Put the gun down. How did you get out? Put the gun down, Argel. What did you do to Marcos? He wanted to leave... and take you. You and your sister. Put the gun down. We have to go back home. Don't come any closer. There's no time left... The Beast is coming. Let's go! No! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad... Come on, Luciana. Luciana... Wake up Luciana... Luciana! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad... I'm scared... Don't worry... I'm here.
