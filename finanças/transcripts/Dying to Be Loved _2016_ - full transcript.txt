Gary! How you doing babe? It's beautiful, I love it. What're you reading nerd? Romanticism? Yeah. Hey, Conner. How come you're home? We finished the project early. Does this look straight? I thought I'd hang some photos of my family... and some of yours. Found those in the last box the movers delivered. Once they get up, we are officially moved in. Where's mom? Oh, she's around somewhere. Are they your parents? They look nice. Yeah, they are. And they're going to stay with us when they come up for the wedding. I thought you never went near the water? That's the day I nearly drowned. Hey, I'm sorry... it's my fault. We'll get a different one, okay? Where's my mom? She's always here when I get back from class. She's around. Why don't you help me pick one of these? I don't like any of them. They just remind me how unhappy I always am. What's going on? Nothing. Nothing's going on. Where's my mom? Emily... Mom?! What are you doing? I'm so sorry, I was... You're counting my pills! Jill, sorry, she figured out something was up. Yeah, because I'm not an idiot. I'm also not a baby. I'm 18 now. I know. And you said if I could handle a full course load, you'd give me more freedom. And you have kept up your side... but with Conner and I buying this house and moving in together, maybe you feel like I'm abandoning you. I don't. If I knew how to feel happy, I'd be happy you found somebody. Sweetheart... something has happened to make you to behave differently. I don't know what you're talking about. You're walking around in your own world. You're hardly eating. I watch you study and you read the same page over and over. I thought maybe you stopped taking your medications again. That was one time! How long are you going to hold that against me? It was one time and you know what almost happened. Conner said that, he thought... it's because you have a boyfriend, and I was like, "No, she would tell me." Because we're, you know... Do you have a boyfriend? Why didn't you tell me? I thought you'd be mad or something, I dunno. Mad, why would I be mad? This is great! But how did... how? How did I actually interact with another human being? Honey, I'm sorry, that came out wrong. I'm very happy... I met him at school, okay? Okay... Okay, this is great. I can't believe it. I thought it was us and it's the opposite. Emily has a boyfriend! You were right, this is amazing. Yeah, it's crazy. I've just been so overprotective... maybe I can relax a little. What? I don't know. I asked her about a photo today and she did that thing where she goes off into a trance. What photo? It was stupid of me. She was wearing a bathing suit and I asked her without thinking about it. I know you said she nearly drowned, but the words just came out, I'm sorry. It's okay. It's actually what happened after. After? That night at the hospital... she asked me to call her dad because she wanted to see him. He had left before she was born, so she never got to meet him and... I think nearly drowning made her want to make a connection. So I tracked him down and he swore he'd show up, but he never did. Never heard from him again. She's been a different person ever since. Wow, what a complete... We were really young when we had her. I had to grow up quickly and he just couldn't. You know that's not me. I know... It's taken me a long time to realize that not all men are like that. To finally let myself trust someone. And I'm the lucky winner. Yes you are. So don't do anything to screw it up before the wedding. Okay. Oh... yeah that looks perfect. Thank you. Yeah, thank you! Get away from there, come on. They're here. Okay... great. Okay... thanks. Hi! Come on in. Gary, this is my mom and her fiance, Conner. Thanks so much for having me over, huh? You're welcome. It's our pleasure. Gary... my daughter says you two met at school. Do you have classes together? No. We met while I was at work... campus security. Campus security? Oh, that's... nice. Are you planning on making law enforcement your career? Mom's a lawyer. No... it's not really my thing. I get a discount on the night school classes, so I'm taking a business course. I'm going to get a startup going as soon as I finish. What kind of startup? Whatever makes the most money. That's a beautiful scarf, sweetheart. I've never it on you before. Gary gave it to me. I was looking at it in a store, he went back and bought it for me. Seriously, Conner? I'm just firing up the string beans. I design houses with smart technology. I can operate the alarm, the heating, the stove, all from this app on my phone. Sorry, Gary, he loves to show off his toys. No, this is pretty cool. Thank you. I just type in my access code... Touch "stove" and then I can turn it on or off, check the timer... anything. Somebody could really make some money at that, huh? I do make money at this. It's my business. I know, I just mean... really make some money, you know. I started this company myself and we're doing... You know, actually... I think I should get some drinks. Make mine a double. Gary? Gary...? You were saying that you just started school again... what were you doing before? Were you in the military? Nah, snowboarding. Not that ski bum stuff, the real thing. Gary was nationally ranked... ...I was talking. Sorry. Sorry babe, I shouldn't have snapped at you like that. So, yeah, I was nationally ranked. Trained for a couple of years up in the mountains. Beautiful place called Alexandria. I still go up there in the off season. My coach, he's got a place. He feels bad because I was supposed to make it to the Olympics, but then I busted up my knee. I hope you don't think this is rude. I'm trying to quit smoking. And you're used to smoking after every meal. Sounds like you quit? Yeah. I used to go through a couple dozen of those things a day. That's about my pace, too. Umm, sweetheart... We should clear the plates and bring out desert. I made apple pie and I forgot to buy ice cream. But I could put whipped cream on it if you like. That'd be great, Jill. Okay. Oh hey, Conner... thanks. Yeah. He's a little rough around the edges. He's controlling, he's underemployed, and he can't stop bragging about himself. And he's so creepy! Shhh! I can't believe my daughter is as blind and stupid as I was when I was 18. Jill, you're an over protective mother, I get it. This will be one of those nights we laugh about years from now. This isn't funny. Trust me, it is. The no nonsense attorney, unhinged by the first boy her teenage daughter brought home. He's not a boy. Relax... take a deep breath. He's probably going to be the first of many boyfriends from here on out. So I'm not the first mother who thinks her daughter could do better? Nope. And I'm just, you know, overreacting? Yup. Okay, so what am I going to do? You are going to go out there, smile and when she asks you what you think, you are going to have thought of at least one complimentary thing to say about him. That's going to take some time. Yeah, well... Thanks again for dinner. You're welcome. My family is having a cook out next week. Consider yourselves invited. Yeah? Can't wait! See you later. Bye. Bye! So what do you think? He's umm... handsome! I know. These hamburgers are delicious. Those are actually turkey burgers. Oh. I'm just so happy we could all get together. Sorry if it's a little tight around the table. No it's fine, really. Well, we would have been able to eat inside, if you had turned the fan on so it didn't stink up the house. Sorry, Gary. It won't happen again. Good. What's up Ritchie? Introduce yourself... this is my bro. How you doing? Sorry I'm late, I was out front having a car towed. It wasn't the... It's just a joke. That must come in very handy... having a family member who's a police officer. Yeah, I haven't gotten a speeding ticket in years. Come on, let's go get more drinks. Gary has never been happier. And Emily... she was so quiet and reserved when Gary first started bringing her over, but now... she's such a wonderful young woman, Jill. She's been here before? Oh, many, many times. That's how I knew to make blueberry pie for desert. I hope to be making them for many years to come. just me or is it strange? They treat Gary like he's the head of the family. I was talking to Ritchie. Their dad was a cop too. He was killed in a high speed pursuit when they were kids. Maybe Gary figures he needed to step up. That would explain a lot. Emily seems happy. Do we have it all wrong? You want to live in a tent in the backyard? No, I just... I'm trying to... I'm trying. I'm going to make a run for the washroom. Wish me luck. Hey mom... Hi honey. Hey! You cannot mix alcohol with your medications. Relax, I haven't had any pills for days. What?! Gary says that doctors are too quick to medicate. They're just giving away pills like candy to people who don't really need them. He wanted to see the real me. Honey... the "real you" is a teenage girl who suffers bouts of depression and once tried to kill herself when she skipped her medications. Why don't you just scream it so everyone can hear? What can I do for you, Jill? You can stay the hell away from my daughter. I get it, you want me all to yourself. Excuse me? Well, I was kind of thinking more along the lines of the three of us getting together. Pretty sure I could make the both of you happy. Come on, give me a taste so I can compare mommy and daughter. Let's go! What? Why? No! Okay, let's all calm down. Emily, we're going to go home. I'm 18, mom... I'll go home when I want to. And right now, I don't want to. Jill, don't worry about it. I'll take good care of your daughter. I am really sorry. He gets this way sometimes. You're a cop! Jill, your daughter is 18. If she wants to stay here, she's free to stay. There's nothing I can do. Thank you, Ritchie. We know. Come on, Jill. We should go. And the worst part is, after everything I've done for her. And she knows this... idiot... for like a month and she chooses him over me. I don't think it's you... it's her dad. She didn't have a father growing up, so she's fallen hard for the first slightly older man who showered her with attention. It's Psychology 101. And she's off her meds. You know how unpredictable that makes her. Well she's going back on them or... Trying to punish her won't work, she'll run back to Gary. Stop it please! Stop being the voice of reason and let me vent for once! Please! I'm sorry, I just... I'm sorry, I'm... It's like I'm watching this slow motion train wreck, and I'm not doing anything to stop it. Okay. Al Jennings? Yeah. Thank you so much for meeting me. You come highly recommended by the guy our law firm normally uses. Tommy does excellent work. Why didn't you hire him? To be honest, I feel a little silly. I don't really want anyone to know what I'm doing. Well, silly will still pay my bills. What do you need? A background check, please. I found a few things on my own, but I'm sure there's more. And who am I looking at? My daughter's boyfriend. Actually I was looking for a name. Oh yeah, sorry. Gary Smith. He's a security guard at the university. I know I sound like a crazy over protective mother, but I want to make sure she's okay, and he's never been to prison or anything, know what I mean? Yeah, I checked into my daughter's fiance too. I will email you the report once I put it together. Until then, maybe your instincts are wrong, so... Try and relax. Thank you, I appreciate that. Okay, now you think I'm overreacting? I just can't believe you hired a P.I.. That's what bothers you? Not what he found? The point is that you hired a P.I.. I would've preferred if you talked to me first. This is a bit extreme. The point is I was right. And I reconsidered... I just would've preferred you talk to me first. Look, I found the information about the DUI's by myself. It was the private investigator who tracked down the girl who accused him of date rape in high school. That's what was sealed by the court. There's no record of any convictions. There weren't even any charges! It's like this guy has a guardian angel. I don't know what to say. I do. She can't go on seeing him. Look at his record! It won't work. DUI's? Date rape? What's she going to say when she hears all of that? She's going to say that he's changed, and maybe he has. These are all at least five years ago. Besides, what did you say when your parents told you that Emily's dad was no good? That was different. I refused to listen. I don't like this guy and all this makes me like him even less, but I just know you can't tell her to stop seeing him, Jill. She's a teenage girl in love for the first time. If you paint Gary as the bad boy, she'll see him as the victim and she'll run to him and she'll push you away. She suffers from depression, Conner. What happens when she does see him for who he really is? That's the point. You need to stay on good terms with her. So that you are there to help her get over him. I don't want her making the same mistake I did, okay? And look how you turned out! You've got a daughter, a great job, and you're engaged to the most wonderful man in town. I am! You have to let her make her own mistakes at some point. It's just part of growing up. I was thinking maybe my mom was right. About my medication. We'll talk about it. Because... Look, I said we'll talk about it, okay? Okay. What the hell is this idiot doing? That guy nearly cut us off! Gary, slow down! You're gonna get us killed! Thank you. That guy nearly killed us. Yeah but he didn't. Yeah, because I stopped in time. Not too many people would be able to do that. And you did great, but now it's over. Let's just go home. Yeah. Well, look who we have here. Please don't. Just shut up, okay? I know what I'm doing. I'm going to teach this guy a lesson. There he is! Gary, please! Shut up all right? Hey! Where'd you learn how to drive, bro? What's your problem man? It's pretty obvious what my problem is! You almost cut us off the road back there. Oh yeah? What're you gonna do about it? Oh no, here he comes! Tough guy, huh? Pretty big one too, huh? Come on let's go, take your shot. I think there's going to be a fight. My boyfriend and another guy. Please send somebody. You want me to take a shot? No, I only gotta take one. You stay right there. Don't wipe that smile off your face either, that's good! In the glove compartment, open it. Hand it to me. Come on, hand it to me. I said give it to me, all right? I'm gonna teach this guy a lesson, okay? Tough guy, huh? How about now? Hey man, just... No? Why? What changed? Just calm down. Calm? Just calm down. Calm down? Why? Trust me, I'm calm. Thank you so much. Of course. Conner, you remember Gerald Ivers. The firm's senior partner. What happened? Apparently there was a road rage incident, involving your daughter's boyfriend, Gary. He claims there was a car that cut him off. He chased it down, forced the other driver off the road, and then there was an argument that ensued. It ended with Gary shooting the other man. He died about 15 minutes ago in hospital. Oh my god. We're just going to try and stay calm. Right now we don't know all the facts. All we know is their version of them. So Emily was arrested? Gary's the one who shot him. Emily called 911 when the incident happened and the operator heard and recorded the call. Including Gary asking Emily to hand him the gun so he could teach the man a lesson. Which makes her an accomplice. Let me go get an update. I knew something like this was gonna happen. You can't blame yourself. I'm not blaming myself, but I should have said something when I had the chance. Mom! How are you doing? I hate it in jail. Please don't make me go back. That's why we're here, Emily. Tomorrow we're gonna bring you before a judge and we're gonna ask for bail. You're a first time offender, you live at home, you have strong family ties. I feel quite confident they're gonna grant it. What if it's too high? Don't worry, we'll do whatever we have to. We can use the house as collateral. Let's go miss. Okay, I have to get back to the office. I'll see you all tomorrow morning. Thank you. We should have got you a different lawyer. I thought he did good today. Mom, the prosecution ran circles around him for the second day in a row. I have no confidence in him. Well he's the best we could afford. Just relax, okay? Everybody. Gary, he's going to present your case tomorrow, then closing arguments after that. It's not going well and you're running out of time. All he has to do is put me on the stand, right? The jury's gonna be eating out of my palm. Is there any more coffee? After deliberating for less than a day, the jury in the Gary Smith trial has returned with their verdict. Guilty. Guilty of second degree murder. I don't understand: why is he still free? State law allows him to stay out on bail until the sentencing hearing, which isn't until next week. But the judge could have revoked it. His brother's a cop, he's got a job, he's living at home where the person who put up her house as bail can keep an eye on him. The judge obviously doesn't know him as well as we do. This is bull! They must have bribed the jury or something, right? Come here! Hey, don't cry. Don't cry, okay? Look, I can appeal, right? Nobody is going to keep us apart. He'll be lucky if he gets 15 years. Let's do it... let's do what we said we'd do if this happened. Okay. Yeah. No... no way. The district attorney got a conviction with Gary. That's all she cares about. She's offering this plea deal and I really suggest that you take it. Honey, it's a really, really good deal. You don't get any jail time. It's just probation. You said that you didn't hand Gary the gun. If we go to trial on this, the jury might not believe you. If you don't take this deal, you could go to prison. But I'd have to admit guilt. Don't you see? That'd mean admitting that Gary is guilty, too. The jury spoke, Emily. Gary's case is over. Admitting guilt now will not hurt him. I love him, and I believe in him, and I'm not going to stand up in court and admit that we're guilty. Emily, you are guilty. It was self-defense! People get cut off in traffic every day. And they shake a fist and say "you bastard" and then everybody goes on with their lives. But Gary chased that man down. And Gary took a gun from your hands, and pointed it at that man and killed him. It was cold blooded and a stupid waste of a human life. And this is the man you keep telling me you're in love with. Fine... it was stupid. Did you stop loving me after the first stupid thing I did? You're my daughter. I will never stop loving you. And I love him. I'll give you two a minute. I don't want to live without him. Who is this? It's me. Hey! Where are you? In my room. We stopped at a store and I had just enough time to buy one of those prepaid cell phones. Mom and Conner didn't see. Can you get away? They're not going to let me. They're really serious about it. They don't want me anywhere near you. Well, how many minutes did you buy for the phone? Lots and lots and lots. That's my girl. Miss Yates? Yes? It is my unfortunate duty to inform you... your daughter is gone. She and Gary Smith... took their own lives. Emily is in her room. We found their car parked at the top of Five Mile Dam. Unfortunately I was not allowed to take the original, but I made a copy of the note she left behind for you. "Mom, I'm so sorry, but I can't go on living." No... I'm so sorry. No! Emily! Emily! Emily! Jill, come on inside. Thanks. Have a seat. How is your mom holding up? Holding up the best she can. That's good. It's our policy to suggest to victim's families not to watch something like this. I really want to know what happened. It can be very upsetting to see the end of a loved one's life this way. I appreciate your concern, I really do. But I want to see it. Years ago Five Mile Dam was tagged as a possible terrorist target, so a security camera was installed. We never caught any terrorists, but we've recorded more than a few people jumping. You'll see the camera pans in a circle to give us a view of the whole area, so it only picked them up once every couple of minutes. Why chains? To take them to the bottom. So even if they panic, they can't get back to the surface. Drowning is better than being smashed on the rocks as the current takes them... Oh my god, do you need some water? I'm okay, I'm sorry. I just... It just hit me what her last moments must have been like. That was stupid of me. It's okay. Maybe this is enough. I need you to show me. Jill, you look like you're going to be sick. Show me. Please, Ritchie. That's it. If you need a minute, I can step outside. You haven't found the bodies? No. They'll wash up somewhere down river most likely. But sometimes they get caught under a rock or in an eddy. It might be a while. Thank you, Ritchie. I'll call you as soon as I know anything new. Thank you. How did it go? Are you okay? I don't think they did it. Did what? Kill themselves? I think they're still alive. Jill, I had a hard time when my brother died and went through a period where I just didn't want to believe it either. I'm not in denial, okay? I saw the tape, I saw the evidence. You don't see them jump. No bodies have washed up. And what's Emily's biggest fear? Well, it's water, obviously. Right. She almost drowned when she was a kid. So why would she choose that method of suicide when she's got a cabinet filled with prescription medicine? Maybe that's what Gary wanted. Well until there's a body, I'm holding out hope. Okay. I can understand that. But you don't actually believe me. I will be supportive no matter what turns out to be true. I'd hate for you to convince yourself she's alive and go through all this pain and suffering again, that's all. Where are you going? To look for my daughter! Jill, I promise, I'll call you as soon as I know anything. I know, I just wanted to talk to you for a minute. Yeah, okay. Come on. They staged their deaths, Ritchie. It's not uncommon for the victim's family members to have a hard time letting go. No, I mean it. I've done some digging and found plenty to back it up. You saw the tape, you saw them jump. No, I didn't see them jump and neither did you. I actually didn't see them jump, but... And the way that the camera pans, it gives them plenty of time to stand there, let it pass, and then run out of view. I'm sorry, why do you think they would do that? To stage their deaths. They couldn't have people witness it, so they intentionally went to a place where it would be filmed. And my daughter is afraid of the water, she is terrified of drowning. But she jumped in the river. I've seen enough of these to know there's no set rule when it comes to suicides. I went to the hardware store where Gary got the chains. The clerk said Gary argued with him over the correct change. Why do that if you were never going to use it again? And he went to a restaurant across the street for his last meal. Why would he go there when he could have gone anywhere? He could've splurged. I wish I knew what was going through my brother's brain that day... I really do. He was clearly overwhelmed and acting irrationally. I know I don't have a smoking gun. But if you look at it all together, doesn't it put the tiniest bit of doubt in your mind? Jill, I still want my brother to be alive, but... Okay, maybe it does add up to something... the best I can do is try sell the idea to the chief. Thank you, thank you... But for now, try to get some rest, Jill. You look exhausted. Okay... Hi, please come in. Ms. Yates, I know in these situations I'm supposed to send a card or flowers, but with my schedule I never manage to get around to it. I really wanted you to know how sorry I am for your loss. Thank you, it's Jill. And I'm not convinced condolences are warranted. I don't think I understand. I think my daughter and her boyfriend staged their deaths. And if I look tired, it's because I've been running around trying to prove it. You think they faked their suicides to escape punishment? Ritchie, what did he say? Dammit! Didn't you explain what we talked about? I'm sorry, I'm not angry at you, I just don't understand. Okay. So apparently the chief of police says they don't have the resources to chase down a theory. I used to be a state cop, I can understand what he's saying. Once they've exhausted the search for bodies, then they'll entertain your theory. Am I crazy? No, I had a client once who faked his death. Convincingly. Turned up eight years later living in Florida with a new name and a new family. So, no, it's not out of the realm of possibility, but they have to rule out the obvious first. Maybe I need to hire you again? It'll be more expensive than a background check. It's okay... whatever it takes, Al. Okay then. I'm glad you called, Jill. I wanted to talk to you about holding a joint memorial service. A memorial service? I know they haven't found the bodies yet, but Ritchie says these things can take time, and it might be best if we all tried to move on as soon as possible. That's why I wanted to talk to you. Because I believe Gary and Emily are still alive, and I think we should hire a private detective to look for them. Now, he's not cheap. I know it cost you almost everything to hire an attorney and for bail, so I'd like to front the money. But I feel if we do this together... They're gone, Jill. Yes I believe they're gone, as in run away. And the police are so intent on looking for bodies they won't consider anything else. And the more time that passes, the harder it will be to find them. We saw the video. I read Gary's suicide note. Did you see him jump? I'm trying to be polite, Jill, but this is a very difficult time and you're not helping. Okay, okay. What if you hold the service and I still hire the detective? What harm would it do to look? I don't want to be part of any wild goose chase. This isn't a wild goose chase. This is your son we're talking about. Don't you want him back? Oh, so if he's alive and on the run, you'd forfeit bail and you lose everything... Are you hoping he's dead? I would gladly spend the rest of my life living in a cardboard box if I could have one more day with my son. But I can't, because he's dead. He's not dead. Even if he were still alive, I wouldn't want you to find him. Why? So he could be brought back and go to jail? Why would I want that? If he's on the run: good, stay free. Honestly I don't know why you'd want to bring your daughter back into all this. We all need some healing now. Jill, please come to the service. Maybe you'll find it helpful. This is ridiculous. Holding a service when there's no body. They're mourning the best way they know how, Jill. Just because we're not doing it, doesn't make it ridiculous. And if it's so ridiculous, what are we doing here? Well, it'd be just like Gary to show up at his own funeral so he can hear what everyone has to say about him. As much as I want to dislike his mother, she seems to be in a lot of pain right now. I need to show my support because that's what people do, yadda, yadda, yadda. That's the woman I love. And it's family only, remember. We should be honored they invited us. I still think he'd show up if he could. Jill! Thank you so much for coming. It means a great deal to me. It's okay... it's okay honey. You're gonna get through this. You're right, somehow we will. We're about to get started. Thank you for coming today. While it is wonderful to see those that loved my brother deeply, it is the circumstances that makes this such a sad occasion. My brother was a great guy. Somebody who was always there for others. I forgot I set it for push notifications on Emily and Gary. Well turn it off! Okay. We all have memories of him, and we are going to ask anyone who'd like to share something about him, to please come on up. Jill where are you going? Can I get you anything? This scarf is all that's left of my little girl. Jill, don't do this to yourself... I have a right to be sad. You said I needed to mourn. Let me do it, please. Okay. Have you gotten any sleep? Do I look that bad? Honestly, yes. You brought me out here to tell me that I look as bad as I feel? The last time I talked to you, you were certain that your daughter and Gary Smith staged their deaths. There's too much evidence to think that way anymore... I didn't mean to upset you. Then why am I here, Al? The case I told you about, the guy who faked his death and started a new family... I asked him how he could leave his old family behind? He said, "One person on the run is easier than two." They found your daughter's things, but they didn't find any trace of Gary. Maybe they haven't found it yet. Or maybe you were half right when you said they faked it. So you're saying they haven't found any evidence on Gary, because he actually didn't jump? Because I saw the footage, Al. I saw my daughter walk to the edge with him. Maybe he thought she was a loose end. Convinced her they were gonna do it together. You're saying he pushed her? I don't know that for certain... He pushed her off the dam and then he just walked away. He killed my daughter and he's still alive? Maybe, Jill, maybe. But if he's out there somewhere, I would hate to think he might get away with it. Oh he's not gonna get away with it! That's why I called you. What should I do? Find out how he walked away from the dam and then maybe you'll find out where he went. Damn, what am I even looking for? Perfect. Hey. I thought maybe we could talk about the plans for Emily's service. What readings you wanted. Or songs. Now is not a good time. It's not a good time to plan your daughter's funeral? Seriously? I just can't right now. Jill, you're not alone. I know I can't understand how you feel, but I loved her too. If you loved her so much, why didn't you try a little harder to help me keep her? Where did that come from? "You can't keep her from Gary, Jill." "You can't threaten to kick her out of the house, Jill." "I'm not gonna pay for bail, Jill." So this is all my fault? No, it's Gary's fault. You're just not as helpful as you think you are. I have worked really hard to be supportive throughout all of this. I haven't even brought up the subject of rescheduling the wedding. You just did. In your typical Conner passive way, you just did. Okay, then let me be as direct as "Conner" can be... She's gone, Jill, and this isn't going to bring her back. Sorry if that's not helpful. But it's the truth. I don't want to pour cold you could tie Garyrts,t w to a tire track and a piece of gum. You told me I had to find how Gary walked away from the dam. He didn't just walk all the way out of town. He must have had a car stashed somewhere to get away. It was in the middle of nowhere, Al. No reason for anyone to park in that spot. Unless they knew they're coming out of the woods right there. And I found gum next to the tracks. The same gum Gary is always chewing. Half the people in the world who are trying to quit chew that stuff. That isn't enough to tie it to Gary. Can we run a DNA test? You are tenacious! Okay, I know a lab, but we still need to find a sample of Gary's DNA to compare it to. He was at my house, but it's not like I kept anything he drank from. I still have police contacts, maybe they can get a sample from when Gary was arrested in the past. That would never be admissible in court. All we need is a match to tell us we're on the right track. In the meantime, I can see if Gary registered a car or rented a car or hired an Uber, anything. And I'm going to put you in touch with some people I've worked with in the past. A victim's advocacy group that's really handy with social media. You want me to make a memorial page for Emily? Do you want to make a memorial page? No. I want to find a person who saw Gary out on the road after he supposedly jumped. Then you be sure and tell them that. Okay. I've tried to be nothing but helpful. And if my advice about Emily wasn't working, that doesn't make me out to be the villain, it just means that I was wrong. Look, let's... let's get through this together. Okay, maybe I should give you some space tonight? I love you very much, Jill. Whatever it is you're feeling, I just want you to know that. Good night, Conner. It smells like gas. Oh my god! Conner? Conner! Conner honey! Conner! Wake up! Get up, get up. Come on. No! Come on, come on, please. Somebody help me! Jill, hi... I didn't know you worked nights. I don't, I heard the address on my radio and I ran over here. Thank you, Ritchie. So... the fire department says it was the smart stove that Conner designed... it turned itself on. But with no ignition, it just spewed gas into your house. It's a good thing you didn't turn on lights or build up static electricity. The whole house could've gone up. Looks like Conner was asleep on the couch. He was closer to the source of the leak. That's why he's in worse shape. You saved his life, Jill. You did good. Let's get them to the hospital. Right away. How is he? He's still unconscious... they just don't know. And how are you? Fine. A little headache, but I'm fine. Gary knew the code. I saw Conner show it to him. All he had to do is download the app from wherever he's hiding. I really hope you're wrong, Jill, but if you're right, why? Why would my brother do this? I don't know, maybe putting up that website has made things difficult for him. Maybe he thinks if I keep asking questions, eventually someone will come looking for him. Conner's a great guy. He is a great guy. I was stupid to forget just how great he is. I'll talk to the chief. See if we can start looking somewhere besides the river. Thank you. Oh my god. I know where he is. Conner, you remember the snowboarding story... he trained in the mountains and he said the coach lets him use his place in the offseason. What was the name of the town? It was, umm... Alexandria. Alexandria! That's it! Okay... I will be back. And I will tell you myself that Gary is in jail right where he belongs. Excuse me... I'm looking for this guy. I was wondering if you recognize him at all? He would have trained here like 3-5 years ago? Trained with a coach named Lonny Harkins? All right, thanks. No? What about his coach, Lonny Harkins? I couldn't find his name in the phone book. That's because he got tired of all the kids pestering him to be their coach. Well, I'm not a kid. He does have a house, it's on the edge of Pine Ridge Road. But I doubt you'll find him there. Right, because it's the offseason. Thank you. Okay, there has got to be something here with your name on it, Gary. Al? Jill, I got the lab results back. The DNA on the gum is damn close to being a match to Gary's sample. It's close? Well, the sample was degraded, but percentage wise, it's close enough to be a familial match. Which is good enough for us. This is great news, Jill. So put it on the website. Call the newspapers. By the end of the day, everybody is going to know Gary drove away that night and is still alive. Al, it's a familial match. Ritchie chews the stuff, too. For all we know, Ritchie could've- Yeah, but like I said, it's not absolute but it's close enough to Gary that it'll work for us. Oh my god... it's Ritchie. It's Ritchie's gum. What? You didn't find any trace of Gary buying or renting a getaway car because he left that job to the one person he could trust to be there when he walked away from the dam... Ritchie? Yes! He was off duty that night, he knew about the security camera, he knew how long it would take Gary to get away. I'll run a DMV check on Ritchie right now. But if you're right, that means it might've been Ritchie who tried to kill you that night. Do you understand? You are in serious danger! Jill? I'm going to hire you a bodyguard. Just tell me where you are. Jill? Where are you? Jill? Mom? Oh my god. Oh my god, baby. You're alive. I'm sorry.... I'm so sorry... Shhh, it's okay. What happened baby? Did he hurt you? No, I'm okay. Are you really here? Yeah. Are you off your medication? Gary wouldn't let me bring them. You were right about him... about everything. It doesn't matter. As long as you're okay. We have to get out of here before he gets back. He turned on me. He's crazy, just like you said. It's okay baby, I'm going to get you out of here and call the cops, okay? I've gotta give it to you Jill, you're not an idiot. From what I hear, you had the whole plan figured out right from the beginning. I had to have Ritchie throw some of our stuff in the river to try and throw you off. Unfortunately, they only found Emily's stuff, so... You are now Elliott Swedburg. Sorry, it was the best I could do. Fake ID's, that's what you were waiting around for? Yup, really good ones too. I guess Emily won't be needing her ID. No. Sad to say, she won't. I've certainly had enough of the crying, the headaches, the lying around in bed all day. Don't need to carry this baggage around with me anymore. Hey hey, Emily, hey... I got pretty upset and I took it out on you. I shouldn't have done that. The plan was so clean and then... But then... then it all started to unravel and I had to improvise. I had to decide to eliminate the entire Yates clan and be done with all of you. But then, after you survived my attempt to kill you, and made that really nice website, it hit me: if she's trying this hard to find her daughter's killer, how much would she pay to get her back... and alive, too? You want me to pay a ransom, yeah? So you can go on the run? Ding ding ding! What do we have for her, Johnny? And I was trying to think of a way to contact you, but here you are. Saves us some time. Now, Jill, how much can you get us? Jill? No! You don't have any money, do you Jill? It's tied up with the court from Emily's bail. But listen, I can sell jewelry and paintings. I just need a little time. I don't think sticking around any longer would be a great idea. Gary, please... Hey, Ritchie, there's some shovels and a tarp out in the garage. Why don't you go throw it in the trunk and we'll get going with these two in a minute? Sure thing, bro. Wait, wait! See? Some people are followers, and then some are leaders. God, look at you... you were such a good little follower. And you saw how happy I made her. Shut up. See? Your mom was always trying to get you to be more independent, look where that got you. At least when you were with me, you were safe. And now you're going to kill me. Hey hey, Emily... shhhh. I still love you. I could never kill you. So I'll have Ritchie do it. You're a total psychopath. Yeah Jill, I am! And you know what your problem is? How you always thought you were better than me. No, I just knew you weren't good enough for my daughter. Hey Ritchie, how's everything going out there? Ritchie? What the hell are you doing? Come on, quick! What the hell happened? Shhh! It's no use, you two. I know these woods. You have no idea where you're going. Seriously, guys. Just come on back. I'll make it quick and painless, I promise. Come on! Mom? Keep running! Gah! Come on! Oh my god, you shot me. You gotta call an ambulance. Yeah... I don't think I can do that, Ritchie. How am I supposed to get away with those people swarming all over the place? Gary!? What? Think about it! I don't want to go to jail, and look at you. You're a cop, you wouldn't last two seconds in prison. This is probably for the best, pal. You can't just let me bleed to death. You know what? You're right. You're my brother. That would just be cruel. This is the best I can do for you, pal. Let's go, C'mon. Let's go! Big mistake! Keep moving, keep moving. I've got you now. This is fun! Wait! All right, let's go. Whoa, whoa whoa... where you going, ladies? The party's just getting started. Don't worry, Jill, if it makes you feel any better, I'll bury the two of you together. Come here. No! You're gonna have to try harder than that. Come on baby, let's go. Is he dead? He killed his own brother. What are we going to do now? I don't know... but I'm pretty sure we can handle anything after this. You made it! We made it! We're married. I wanna take some photos. But I want you in the photo. You're the married couple. Wait I love this, get one in here. Just smile mom, you look so scared. I'm not scared. She's teasing you. I should have done this a long time ago. It only took me being in a coma for you to realize that. And I finally realized what a great listener you are too. Oh really? I love you. I love you. Okay, we need to get you guys changed, get your baggage and get you two to the airport. What? We are postponing the honeymoon. What? Why? We're not going leave town until you can come with us in six months. Three with good behavior. But the honeymoon is for the married couple. We're a family. And we had to fight hard to keep this family together, so... it wouldn't be right without you. I love you so much. Both of you. Okay, one more photo. You get in the middle this time.
