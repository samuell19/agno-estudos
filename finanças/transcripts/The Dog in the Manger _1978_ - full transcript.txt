This way! Quicker! There's hardly ever been an equal scandal! - She must have recognised us. - I'm not sure. But I think she did. Hey, mister! Listen, stop! Stop for a moment! How dare you treat me like that! Come back! Come back! Hey! I told you! Where are the servants? Nobody answers! Was it a ghost that I saw there in the dark? What am I to do now? Your Grace has called me, haven't you? All my bile could hardly melt such phlegm! Go, quickly, you sluggish fool! That's really the name that suits you! Go and learn who was there! Who'd left this room the moment before you came! - Who left this room? - Make your feet answer! Quickly! I'm going. - Learn who he is, I'm waiting. - How awful, oh, how awful! I heard you, Your Grace, but I couldn't believe that Your Grace was crying so loudly at this late hour. There are strangers walking in my house at night! They almost enter my room and have no shame or fear! I saw this impudence myself, Otavio! And my custodians keep unruffled while I'm going mad! - Signora, I've found a hat! - Show it to me! - What a shame. - Well, what feathers... - It was a thief. - Yes, it looks like a thief's hat. Call all women here! What night this will be! You'd better go to bed. In the morning you'll find out everything. No. I won't go to bed, if my name is Diana, I must find out whose fault this was. I won't be able to sleep. Maybe, these ladies will be of help to you. All the rest are sleeping and aren't able to tell you anything wise. - Do you want us to leave the place? - Yes, go away, you both. She's raging! It's an interrogation! She's gone mad. And she doesn't credit me at all. Anarda, you! What can I do for you, signora? - What man has just been here? - A man was here? Right in this room. I know you all and I know you very well. Who let him in so that he could see me? Who sold me? Signora, please, believe me, nobody could even think of such a thing! You think that one of us could let a man in here? That one of us was able to betray you in such a disrespectful way? - No, signora, you are unfair to us! - I wish your words were true, but maybe he was visiting one of the maids? If this occasion deprives you of your precious sound sleep I must be candid, and my duty is to tell you everything. Although this will be against my friendship with Marcela. She is in love with someone. And these feelings are reciprocal. But I cannot make her tell his name. Now you must tell me everything. You've told me the essence of the story, so there's no reason to conceal the rest. Oh, signora, somebody's secret is the worst of all torments. I'm a woman. Isn't it enough for you to know that it was Marcela's guest - and let's stop here? Now you can quietly sleep. There are only words between them, they have just begun... I have never seen more wicked servants! What dirty rumours they'll start about the young widow. All right, I'll show you, I'll teach you how to fear! - If only my late husband, Count... - Your Grace! Please... Calm down. The man who dates her is not a stranger in this house. So Your Grace must not be so much worried. - So it was one of the servants? - Yes, signora. Who? Teodoro. My secretary? Yes, my lady. So don't be afraid. Anarda, step aside. Don't be too hard on her. I managed to calm down when I learnt that this man hadn't been spying on me. Marcela! Signora. Listen. I trusted you my honour and my dreams, and you... What did she tell you about me? You know, I'm very faithful to you in everything. - You claim you're faithful? - What is my betrayal? Isn't it a betrayal, to date somebody here, in my house, - and talk secretly to him? - Wherever I meet Teodoro, he tells me dozens of tender words. Dozens? How pretty! All his thoughts he turns into the words of love at once. So, what does he tell you? - Oh, I cannot remember. - Have a try. He says sometimes, 'Oh, I need salvation! These eyes are killing me!' Or he may say: 'These eyes are my only bless. I couldn't sleep last night and was raving about your beauty...' Once he... But... Why are you interested in all this nonsense? - At least, he makes you happy. - He does. I'm sure Teodoro decided to aim his love at true and honest marriage. Well, love has no other true and decent aim. I could help you in your affairs. Oh, I'd be the happiest woman in the world! I can confess to you, as you are so kind even in your anger, - that I love him more than life! - I have no intentions, Marcela, to prevent you from marrying him. But I also have to care about myself, not to give up my honour and my respectful ancient name. So I cannot have you dating in this house. But as everybody already knows, you can continue your relationships, only try to disguise them. And I promise to help you if the occasion arises. For I know Teodoro well, he grew up in my own house. And you always enjoy my favour, my dear Marcela. I treat you like a relative. I'm all yours, and I'm at your feet. Now, go. And tell them all to leave. Well, what was there? She was in anger, but I gained much from it. Did she learn your secret? Yes, and she knows I'm true to her! I too have often noted Teodoroâ€™s handsome looks, his wit, his charm. And if he was a man of noble birth I'd hold him in the most dear esteem. There's nothing more powerful than love. But my honour is my highest law. I hold the honour of my family above the promptings of my heart. Yet jealousy still lives inside me. Oh, if there was a chance once given by the fate, and he could raise to me, or I could go down to his level. I didn't sleep a bit last night. How could you sleep? If she finds out everything, you're surely lost! I told you: wait a little, let her fall asleep - no, you wouldn't listen. Love always strives for its highest aim! You shoot without looking where you hit! A deft hand will never miss the target. He who is deft will always see what's dangerous and what's a mere nothing. Am I unmasked? Maybe. Or maybe not. For there's no direct evidence, but you're suspected. So I'm in danger. I can get lost at once. What shall I do? Leave Marcela. What do you mean? How dare you! Do you want a piece of good advice? I'm sure it can help you. Try to remember not her charm, but her defects. Try to cherish her biggest flaw - and you're sure to forget her. This is so simple, trust me, master. I'll heal your ailment in a flash. Trust me, as if I were your doctor. You'll be all right, alive and fresh. Treat women properly, gather all cream and honey, but flavour it with pepper, then your life will be light and funny. If you feel that you are keen on women, Try to search some faults and flaws with them, And you'll see how easy the life will be: if a girl is thin let's call her skinny, if a girl is sensible call her a ninny, if she has a heart let's call her crazy, if she's quiet and tender, she must be lazy. If she is too strict, then she's a witch, - If she's coquettish, she is ... - Hussy! Right! - If a girl is lively ... - Then she's fussy! Good! - If she's plump ... - Fat and distasteful! If she's generous - she is wasteful. - If she's thrifty... - Call her stingy. - If she's small... - She is a shrimp! - If she's tall... - She's a strapper. In a day you'll sneeze, in a day you'll sneeze From your love like from the hottest pepper! What an ignorant doctor, what vulgar quackery! What can you expect from a medicine made by such a pharmacist? Your healing suits some bumpkins, you're a charlatan, a quack. No, Tristan, I see women in another light. Ah... Is Teodoro here? It's her. - I've been looking for you. - I'm all yours, signora. The judgment is delivered, we have to leave the place at once. A friend of mine asked me to help her with a rough draft of a love letter. But I myself have little understanding of all love matters. And you will do it better, I'm sure. Please, read this. If you have written it yourself, with your own hand, I wouldn't dare to compete with you. Without even looking I ask you to send this letter as it is. Please, read it. I'm ready to read it, but not to criticize it, but to learn how to write about love. - I've never even tried it. - Never! I've never loved, for I've always been too shy. - I am of timid sort. - Ah, that's why you sneak hiding yourself in bushes or behind a black cloak? Behind a cloak? Me? But when and where? You did so when the butler saw you last night and recognized you effortlessly. Ah, that... That was a joke we played together with Fabio. We sometimes do many innocent mischiefs. Now, read it. Or somebody who envies me tries to blacken my reputation. Or somebody feels jealous... Read it. Just to see the brilliance of your genius, signora. Though the god of love is artful he rarely invented such a trick: to kindle with a passion on seeing another woman's passion, to love because of jealousy, being a pray of the unfair fate. For I'm more beautiful than she is, but he neglected me and gifted another woman with happiness. I hesitate, I have a lot of fears, I'm jealous, but I still don't love, I'm waiting for the feeling, I want to be loved, too, so I don't defend myself and don't give up, searching for reciprocity. But who will understand me? Only myself. So, what do you think? I think that if it is the essence of the letter I couldn't find better words for it. But I'm all bewildered. I've never heard before that love can be conceived by jealousy. It's jealousy that can be caused by love. I think that this signora had pleasure in meeting him, but her heart was free of passion. Only when she learnt that he was in love with someone else, jealousy kindled both love and passion in her. The letter is written brilliantly, I won't ever dare to compete. Still try. - No, I wouldn't dare. - But I'm asking you. Signora, you want to demonstrate my paltriness by this. I'm waiting, and please, make haste. I'm already gone. Come here, Tristan! I'm eager to listen to your orders, though I'm ashamed: My pants are shabby, for your secretary is hard up for money. And there is little good if a caballero's servant is kept neglected. Hard up for money? - Then he's a gambler? - It would be fair if he were! Because those who gamble will win some money after all. - Either this way or other. - So he doesn't gamble. He is too shy. I suppose, he's occupied with love instead? With love? Or, what a joke! He is like pure ice! But such a man - sophisticated, courteous, single, after all, - must have some secret passion in his heart. He's at your service all day long. He has no time for private matters. And in the evening? Does he stay at home? I don't accompany him. I'm lame. - My leg is maimed. - How come, Tristan? I can explain. I rolled down the stairs. - Down the stairs? - Yes, I had such a misfortune. Those steps beat all the stuffing out of me. You seem to have deserved it. Tell me, what was the target of your hat throwing? Why do you keep silent? I'm trying to remember when I fell down the steps. Yes, right. Last night there were too many bats, some flew inside, I threw my hat into the nasty creatures. One flew against the light, which blinded me for a moment, and I threw my hat right into the lamp. At that moment I couldn't keep feet and fell down the steps. Well, what a fantasy! Marquis Ricardo has come to see you. I'm coming. Just you wait, a cheat! Diana, you are a maid of heaven! You are my sweet dream! I'm all confused and blinded by your unearthly gleam! Diana, you are a maid of heaven! You are a rare creature which has no flaws, which has no flaws, your beauty is in every feature! Your beauty is, your beauty is in every feature! Diana, you are a maid of heaven! I am your man, I am your man, I won't allow any rival to tempt you by a crafty plan! Diana, you are a maid of heaven! In any battle, in any fight I'll show and prove, I'll show and prove, I'll show and prove that I'm your knight! I am your knight, I am your knight, I am your knight! You are so beautiful, looking at you I get convinced that you are fine. As we all know, a woman's health is closely related to her beauty. You are so fresh and nice, that only a fool, a churl who has no sense of reason could ask you a question about your health. So, you are fine, as I can judge by your fine features, I'd like to know now if I am fine myself. Marquis, you demonstrate a perfect sense of tact and taste, but my quiet looks do not deserve your loud words of praise. Your Grace, please, have a look. You are busy? Oh, I never steal anybody's time. No, we're not pressed for time. I'm writing a letter to Rome. A visit on a post day is quite unpleasant. You are so kind. How I hope you said it seriously! Well, Zario, what will you say? I think she will reward your ardour. - So you have written it? - Yes, but it came out poorly. For I've been working by the order. Show it to me. Here you are. Let's read it. He who fosters his feelings seeing another person's love, is greedy. His ardour is excited only by envy. He who has never dreamt of beatitude will stay indifferent to another person's happiness. But if you see that your beloved is with your rival, you suddenly feel love, blood surges to your cheeks, and an appeal is yearning to your lips, but I keep silent, or I'll have to insult loftiness with meanness. I'm stopping here, before I overstep the sacred line, I have already revealed myself too much... I'll make myself forget about happiness or they may say that I'm forgetting myself. You are going to outshine the most brilliant minds. - Are you laughing at me? - No. Tell me the truth! My answer is: you've won. I see, there is a reason for me to lose my sleep and peace of mind. If a servant is more skillful than his master, he is turned out of the house. Oh, no, if you are called the winner, it's only because your letter is written so well. Although there is a lame expression. I keep silent, or I'll have to insult loftiness with meanness. I have to give an admonition. One cannot be insulted by love. It doesn't matter, who strives for love, you can offend him with indifference. - Love is a dangerous path! - Love is... ...persistence till the end. If you want to win a noble lady's love, you have to be both zealous and persistent. A woman's heart is rarely made of stone. I'm taking the letter with me, I want to read it once again. - But it is full of nonsense! - No, I don't see even a bit of it. You are so kind. Oh, how I wish I had a letter written by you, I'd always keep it. Well, then... I think, I'd better tear it up. - Tear it up? - Of course. You wouldn't lose too much. Some people lose much more. She's gone. She seemed so proud, now I can't believe my eyes. One needs much courage to make a declaration, so bold and unexpected, like hers. But no, it's ridiculous to think so, she must have meant a different thing. Though it has never happened to hear from this proud lady: you wouldn't lose too much, some people lose much more. Some people lose much more. I've guessed who this friend of hers is. No, this is wrong. She was speaking... about herself. That's still unlikely. She's too clever, too prudent and ambitious. She can't have taken such an unwary step. She was born for other deeds. The best signori of Naples are at her feet. I do not deserve to be even her slave. I'm afraid, the matter quite serious. Perhaps, she learnt about my love for Marcela, and then decided to play a joke, to mock at me. But where do these fears come from? Those who play jokes never blush like roses. And what that sigh and look could mean: some people lose much more. How can I make myself stop dreaming? I must be crazy to think like that! But I'm captured by this beauty, I'm enchanted by this dream! There's no other lady in the world so beautiful and sensible like her! There's no other lady in the world so beautiful and sensible like her! Are you alone here? And we've got a minute to see each other one-on-one! Though, Marcela, I'm ready to fight with death itself for you. And I could easily give all my life just for the chance to see you! There was so much ado yesterday. The Countess lost her sleep and questioned strictly all the servants. I told her myself that we would soon get married. I couldn't conceal from her that I'm all in love with you. I also praised your talent, your character and your writing style. She was quite condescending and kind to me. She said my choice was right and we would make a happy couple. She gave a word that she would help us to conclude our marriage union. Because she was amazed and touched by the story about two loving hearts. The Countess promised you to help with our marriage? She is my relative, so she wished to help me. Oh, how could I misunderstand the situation? She played a trick on me! And I believed a foolish tale! How can the Countess love me? A noble bird will never deign to see a sparrow. The Countess only confirmed that loving hearts must be united by the nuptial crown. This is the best end to the matter! - So you agree? - Yes, Marcela. How can you ensure me? I'll prove it with this hearty hug! I'll sign our treaty with this love embrace. And let this passionate kiss also show you my firm intensions. I see, you are reforming your behaviour. Oh, don't worry, I'm begging you. I was... here... ...telling Marcela that yesterday I'd had a fear that you, signora, would not be happy but would be angry with me for my true intention to marry your devoted servant, and how glad I was to hear that, as Marcela told me, you were so good and kind to help us... Filled with joy, I dared to embrace her. You, Teodoro, have been ungrateful: in my house, you've outraged all decency. I didn't expect such impudence, that you would use my kindness to give yourselves the right to get out of hand. If love becomes so shameless it must be punished. That is why I want Marcela - as you are not yet married - to sit locked up alone, for if other servants see you together they all will have a wish to marry, following her example. - Dorotea! - Yes, signora? Take this key and lock Marcela in my bedroom. She has a lot of things to think over these days. Don't think that I'm angry with you. - What is it, dear? - It's tyranny! And my bad luck. So, Teodoro, you want to marry? Yes, but only if you wish it. Then you donâ€™t love Marcela? I could easily live without her. According to Marcela, youâ€™re out of your wits with love for her. My wits are small, their loss is not a tragedy. But, signora, please believe me. Although Marcela truly deserves attention and some tender feelings she's never had them from me. But havenâ€™t you told her of love so often that you could deceive even a stronger woman? Words are very cheap, signora. Teodoro, what did you say, then? Tell me, just what does a man say to woo a woman, when he tries? He becomes both lover and beggar. He embroiders with a thousand lies one small truth - perhaps not even that. Is that so? What words does he use? Signora, youâ€™re pushing me too far. Those eyes, I said, those lovely eyes whose celestial light enables me to see. Those coral lips and teeth of pearl - that heavenly mouth... - Heavenly? - Yes, and no other words will do. Signora, this is the language of a lover. You have no taste at all, my friend! Iâ€™m afraid I may lose faith in you. Canâ€™t you see Marcelaâ€™s defects outweigh her graces if youâ€™re close to her? Besides, as I often try to tell her sheâ€™s not as clean as she could be... Still I really have no wish to see your love impaired in anyway... Though I could tell you a few things that.. So, let's leave both her graces and disgraces. I wish you happiness. And I'll be happy about your marriage, too! But as a lover, could you give advice to the friend of mine? She's tortured and confused by her love for a low-born man. If she loves him she abuses her authority and noble rank. And yet if she denies her love she will be driven mad by jealousy. This man knows nothing of her love, and he's discreet with her. I'm not a good adviser in such a matter. I'd only tell you that if this lady that you know loves a man so far beneath her that to give way to her desire would put her honour in grave danger, couldnâ€™t she see him in disguise? She could enjoy him freely then. Your advice is dangerous. What if he recognizes her? Now write for me, Teodoro, Some words upon this subject... Good bye. Oh! I slipped. Why are you staring at me? Why donâ€™t you give me a hand? I have too much respect, my lady, to offer you my own coarse hand. Oh, you are so politely rude! Now you hide your hand with your cloak! An honest hand should not be covered. I hold this honour higher than anything. When you are an ageing squire, you will wrap your hand in the cloak for me. But you're still my secretary. And as my secretary, you must tell no one of my fall. If you want to rise yourself... What shall I do? A ridiculous question. The fortune is now on my side. I dare to pursue this strange good fortune, and ignore the fears that fill my head. But if I do, I know Iâ€™ll hurt Marcela. Women give light to us in the eternal darkness, to leave them is the hardest sin. Yet women too desert us when theyâ€™re tired; And if she could drop me, why canâ€™t I drop her? I need to talk to her. You're her cousin, and it will be quite natural to see her home. Since I dream to marry her, I know, she feels worried that we are relatives. But earlier I didn't feel shy, nor had I any fears. Whether he is a cousin or a friend, if a man is not in love, he enters freely to the lady's rooms on business or without any reason. But when he falls in love, he has to rarely visit the house of his sweetheart. He even cannot speak. He's timid, he's afraid of everything. I couldn't escape this either, and now I'm in Diana's nets. Because I am in love, I am deprived of previous privileges. I don't risk to see her like I did in the old times. She went there without her carriage. Only surrounded by her servants. The church is nearby, so Diana, to demonstrate her beauty, went there on foot. I'll go there! My heart is aching. I was waiting whether Cupid's arrows would ever reach my heart. But now the time has come and I can tell that love is here, oh, love is here! Hey, Cupid, you shot your arrow at me and now my blood is boiling in my veins! I cannot wait even a minute now, for I feel that love is here, oh, love is here! What can these young men do? I often think about it myself. Male beauty is seen only in wrinkles and in white hair, oh, in white hair. What can these weak old men do? Old suitors look so ridiculously! The young and the bold are cherished by the fate! The world is for them! The world is for them! Male beauty is seen only in wrinkles. The young are cherished by the fate! Male beauty is seen only in wrinkles. The young are cherished by the fate! Male beauty is seen only in wrinkles. The young are cherished by the fate! The Marquis deserves attention! - Marquis Ricardo! - Yes, him. Forget your jealousy. Diana is indifferent to all. But she may fall in love with him. She is a woman, that's the explanation! Yes, but she is so arrogant, she thinks only of herself! Beauty is always arrogant. Yes, but cruelty isn't good-looking. She's coming. I see the light again. Night leaves my heart! Will you come up to her? Yes, I will, if my rival has no objections. I was waiting here to only see you. I'm very glad to see you here, Count. Signora, I've come here with the hope to greet you and to see you home. Marquis, I'm happy, take my word. And thank you. Love makes me follow you. Alas. You think I'm unnecessary here? Go on, don't be so shy. Well, we'll see. What is love? It's boiling blood, a hurricane, a storm, It bends your will and has no fears. It is all fire, danger, anger, fury, Love is invincible, it brings you pain and tears. Will you find a minute to read a letter from Marcela? She's left her prison and is now waiting to see you. 'Marcela to her husband'. Well, husband! What manners! Only lackeys use such words and phrases. It's so silly! Yes, maybe, the words are silly. Do you really think I want to watch these little flies from my bird's-eye view? The answer is quite clear, but what shall I do with this letter? Look, what you can do. You've torn it? - Yes. - But why? It makes our task much easier and helps us answer faster. But yet you shouldn't have torn it up. To tear up Marcela's letter without even looking into it is rather improvident! Your words seem to be said under the influence of wine. No, it's you who's dizzy because of youth and hastiness! Tristan! The time of happiness comes for every person in this world. And only those who wish to be both deaf and blind don't hear the voice of love. - All right, let's call it so. - My love! My dear! - Stop, Marcela! Don't come nearer! - I don't want to interfere. My dear, what is it? I was looking forward to seeing you so much! Don't violate the countess's prohibition! Even the birds her are strict enough not to talk nonsense. Did you receive my letter? I tore it up. And I have the reason to tear my feelings and break it off with you. - Are these the scraps? - Yes, right. So you tore up my love? Isn't it much better than to love expecting another trouble brewing? So, if you agree, let's part friends and humbly accept our lot. So you are asking... I have a firm intention to be obedient and cause no displeasure to the Countess. I've seen it in your eyes that you don't love me and aren't faithful. Farewell, Marcela. Love has vanished, although I think we can be friends. How could you take such a decision! How can you be so cruel! I need to care about my position, and to be grateful to the family to whom I feel obliged. - Wait a minute! - Leave me alone! - Is it a joke? Please, listen! - I have to go. Well, what will you say? - What can I say? - Is it your answer? - Then I will say... - I wouldn't hurry. But I will utter it, though, maybe, carelessly. That if the Countess weren't so haughty, I would suppose that Teodoro cherishes some secret hope. She respects and favours him. Stop it, Marcela. You're speaking in vexation. Oh, I'll give him no quarter now! I know what to do, I'm not a fool! I'm going to take revenge on him! Where is the secretary? He's needed urgently. - Well, what's the matter? - I was sent to find him. - The Countess is waiting already. - She also has to learn to wait. Ask her what I've been saying about Teodoro. He shirks the work, he's too lazy, you won't find him. Is it a joke or what? Ah, you are in collusion and playing a trick on me! - But all your efforts are in vain. - We? In collusion? - Nothing doing! - I see. You've hatched a plot. I haven't banished Teodoro from my sight. But in my heart there's always been another man. And he looks so much like you. - He looks like me? - Do you look like yourself? I do. So if I'm telling lies, or if I'm dreaming of somebody else, if it's not you who's the treasure of my heart, and if I'm not yours, then may I die in awful torments of unrequited passion. Is it all lies? You cheated? Yet, if you died I'd get back my poor heart that you stole long ago. What is this idle talk for? I don't understand. Our dear Fabio. Don't be shy and take this rare chance. Today Marcela loves, though unwillingly. I don't need her love if it's not her own free will. You see that Teodoro is like that bird who's flown without a trace. Oh, I have to find him. So, he made a blunder, now I'm in favour. Love is a letter: if the receiver isn't found, you may deliver it to someone else. I have no pride, I take things in a simple way. I don't feel offended. I'm all yours as long as I'm alive. And may we both enjoy our happiness! It was my duty to do so. And let's change the subject. Signora, I must confess I don't understand you. Oh, look! Marcela's there. Accompanied by Dorotea. I got so tired of her during these five days. Marcela, go away from here! Let's go. There's something in the air. I guess she's jealous. Or suspicious. - May I tell you a couple of words? - Yes, do. Those two signors who have just left love you like nothing in the world. Or, stop it, it's silly. What suitor do you need? Marquis Ricardo, for example. A perfect match. And the Count is also very good. But you've driven both away. One is a fool, the other is a madman. And you are just like them. I cannot love them because I am in love, and the less hope I have the deeper is my passion. What? Am I sleeping? - You are in love? - Am I not a woman? I'd say you are a piece of ice which is able to freeze sunlight. Yes, right, and now this cold heart is at the feet of someone of humble origin. Who is he? Anarda, I have my pride and know my duty and my honour. I won't tell you who he is. I only know that my love for him besmirches the good name of my family. Oh, no, your love can never damage your reputation. He who loves can turn his passion into hatred. And I decided to destroy my love for him. Will you have strength for it? I will. While I wanted I loved him, but now I have the wish to fall out of love. Oh, if only it were possible to make our heart fall out of love. Alas, we can't command it in this fashion: It is submitted totally to passion. Oh, if only it were possible to make our heart cool down quickly. Alas, see how the merciless fate lashes: Our heart is destined to burn down to ashes. Oh, if only it were possible to make our heart fall out of love. Well... Have you heard? The song seems to disagree with you. Yes, I've heard it. But I also know myself. And I know that I'm able to hate as much as I can love. He who can do this is a person of great power and will. Signora, Fabio told me that you had called me. I've been waiting for you for several hours. I rushed here right after I'd seen him. I'm sorry if I'm late. You know that two noble men are seeking my hand in marriage. I can't decide without your wise advice. Can you tell me who will make a better husband for me? I am afraid that my advice is not appropriate in the matter where one relies on his own taste. And I will serve to any master whom you will choose. I granted you by calling an adviser in such a serious matter. But you didn't justify my confidence. You might ask some older people to help you with this serious matter. I think, your majordomo Otavio could be of help to you, as he is more experienced than me. I wanted you to choose the master for yourself. So you think, I should prefer Marquis Ricardo to my cousin? Your choice is perfect. Well, then I'll take him. Now, go and congratulate him. Who could foresee such a misfortune? Who drove her to this unwise decision? Whose pain can now compare to my aching heart? Here's my reward. I dreamt of rising higher. How could I believe her tender words? It's known that people of unequal origin can never make a match. Leave this hope and lead your ship to the familiar coast. Go back to your Marcela and be happy with this fate. The countess is for a marquis. Love won't stand misalliance. It's difficult to be a love pretender and to forget your former love. The more I try to drive away my memories the more I feel I'm still in love with him. But it's the law of honour, I must forget all feelings, all hopes, all desires. I'll make my heart accept another man and satisfy it with the passion it requires. Have you talked to the countess? Yes, I saw her. And I'm quite happy with the news. She doesn't want to be a widow anymore, so soon we can expect a wedding ball. Both suitors love the countess, but she, having considered it quite thoroughly, - decided to prefer the marquis. - Good choice! I'm sent to bring congratulations to him. But I think, I'll let you have this chance to earn some gold. Go quickly. The marquis is quite generous. And he'll remember your good service to him. I'm already flying to him. You see, how fine it all turned out. The marquis can be proud, he managed to persuade the countess to marry again. I've been looking for you in excitement. Can you confirm what I hear everywhere? Alas, Tristan, it's true, I've been mistaken. I know it's not fair to beat the person who is already beaten, but I would like to tell you how conceited you became! Alas, I did. Now I'm fallen and broken. What a miserable view you'll have when you come back to Marcela. We'll quickly make up the quarrel with her. - Marcela! - Who is it? It's me. - Did you forget me? - Yes, I did. How dare you to even call my name! I wanted to check how strong your love was. But my attempt was too precipitate, as I can now see. But what's the matter with you? What's happened? You're disappointed with your lot. You've been refused a noble love, and you're coming back to servants. Or are you playing a joke on me? I never run away from troubles or suffering. You've won. And I'm coming back to my Marcela. I was enchanted by wicked dreams, now I'm awakened. So if you have at least some love, accept me back and, please, forgive me. How touching! So, try again! Be bold and persistent, or she may see your cowardness! Don't miss the chance. I'm more humble, and I have found my love. Farewell. I need a rest from you, you are too tiring. Besides, Fabio may see you, and he's already almost my husband. Tristan! Help me! Hold her! Signora, stop. Everybody knows that there can be breaks in love. All crimes can be forgiven if a person is begging for forgiveness. You see, Marcela, the matter is... - Let me go. - Wait a minute! They are together again. It seems to me that you are angry, signora, that they are together? Anarda, we must stand here and watch attentively. I'm jealous, and I am in love again. Leave me alone! Tristan is trying to reconcile them. - They must have had a quarrel. - A pander! How only he lives on earth! If Marcela declares to the whole world that she loves another man... - ...why should I care? - A lion gets offended. Fine, then let her marry him! Have I ever told Marcela that I'm in love with any other woman? But I think she told you lies to tease you! No, I didn't! - It's true, I didn't tell you lies! - Stop it, Marcela. Your Grace, don't listen, she's talking nonsense! I was begging, now I'm angry! I'll show her my true revenge! Oh, may I be hit with thunder! Stop swearing! I'm furious, but I... I'm unsteady on my feet. This rogue's tricks have no limits! Tristan! I have no time! - Let me go! - Let her go. All right, I am not holding her. Go! I cannot leave, my love! I want to hold you in my arms! To lose myself in love! You'll never hear it coming Its language is unknown But when it comes, You'll know that it's love at once You'll know that it's love at once Steel is obedient to a hammer, It's thrown out of the hot forge into the ice. And as this torture is repeated A perfect sword is being born! Like steel, my heart is thrown into fire by promising and tender looks, And then it's tortured by being thrown back into the ice of haughtiness. And if I don't perish in the forge of passion, I'll only be strengthened by this torture! A DOG IN THE MANGER Episode 2 Once a monk came to a nun, He wanted to play chess with her, But the nun started to shame him: Don't you remember, today's a day for fast! Oh, what a shame! Don't you remember, today's a day for fast! An old cook was jealous of his young wife and of his handsome kitchen boy, I know him, he's in the kitchen and cooks for me! Oh, what a shame! He cooks for me! A butcher fell in love with a young girl. Oh, what brisket, he said aloud! And then added: but sirloin is better! Oh, what a shame! Sirloin is better! If any other man will ever take your place in my heart - I'll die! Now my love for you is burning in my heart! And if I ever offend you, you may return to Fabio to become his wife! Do you want to expiate your fault? - I'll move moutains for you! - Then say: all other women in the world are ugly! Compared to you - oh yes! Who would object to it? Although we are friends, I still feel jealous a little. I am confused that Tristan is here. Go on. You want to talk about me? - Say: the countess is ugly! - The countess is like a frog! - And that she's a fool! - I haven't met more foolish! - And that she's a twaddler! - She chatters like a magpie! I have to interrupt them, or they'll say too much. I cannot stand it, I'll reveal myself. Oh, no, signora, it's not proper. Who wants to know all the truth about the countess, must talk to us. - I cannot listen to it anymore. - First of all... I won't wait what will be second. Everything must have its limits. - I'm leaving. - The countess... The countess? - I always have to look for you. - Signora, please believe me... Now, busy yourself. Teodoro, take the pen. She'll kill me, or drive me away. - Now, write. - I'm ready, my lady. I entrust my destiny to the saints. If a noble woman reveals her feelings to the man of low origin, it's more than just indecent to court another woman. And he is a perfect fool, who doesn't appreciate his happiness. - Is it all? - What else is needed? - Fold it and seal. - I have already sealed it. I only don't know the addressee. The letter is addressed to you. I don't understand. Does she love only once a week? She makes me bleeding like a doctor. How strange her love pulse beats. Oh, my dear! What did she tell you? My blood's still hammering in the temples. - She said... - What? ...that she wants you to marry Fabio. Yes, Marcela, here is the letter to the estate with the reques to send your dowry. What is it? I wish you all the happiness, but now that you're almost a bride, please, don't even approach me. Listen... It's not the right time for complaints. How ungrateful Teodoro is! Who can tolerate it? I cannot wait even a minute. And I'm hurrying to kiss her hand. Tell signora that the marquis has just arrived. Oh, what a torment! What is it with you? I'm going. And tell her that her spouse has arrived! Our master. Tomorrow morning, my friend, you will receive a splendid horse and one thousand silver coins. I'm all yours beginning with this day. This is just the first step. Diana gives you orders, but for me - you have become the best friend. - I'm at your feet. I am indebted to you and I want to thank you. - You are here, marquis? - Where else I am to be? When Fabio, your faithful herald, brought me the news that I'm now welcomed... That he's your spouse now! I rushed here at once. Such moments are difficult to bear. And if your husband is going to get mad, he will go mad because of happiness. My heart is now in comfort! I have achieved my dream! I don't even know what to answer. I don't understand. I didn't invite you. Fabio, what does it mean? I don't understand. The secretary sent me to call you. I wouldn't arrange the thing myself. Ah, it's Teodoro's fault. He heard me saying not long ago that I valued you more than Federico, that I admitted your superiority over him. So they decided, that I was ready to marry you. Forgive these fools. If this place weren't so sacred because of you, I swear, I'd kill this Fabio! I hope that once my passion will melt your icy heart. What is it? How did you dare? - Your Grace, I am not guilty! - Where is he? Send Teodoro to me! Alas, I'm left without the promised money and the horse. The marquis wanted to kill me. But I regret not this, I'm crying over the loss of money. I'll give you a piece of good advice. What advice? Count Federico is now all worried that she can marry the marquis. Go to tell him that the engagement is broken. He'll reward you generously. - I'll fly there like an arrow. - Yes, run. Oh, love, why are you tormenting me? I was prepared to forget you. Why does your shadow visit me? And brings a cruel pain into my heart. Oh, love, why are you tormenting me? Oh, love, what do you want from me? You, like a serpent, crawled into my heart. You tempted it with a sweet hope, aroused carelessly my wishful thinking. Oh, love, why are you tormenting me? Oh, love, why are you tormenting me? Did you call me, signora? I'm glad that this fool has left. I read a hundred times the letter composed by you, signora. And I can assure you that it's reverence that must be blamed for my being shy. But my fault is also in missing the signs of your attention. I should have told you long ago that I'm in love with you! Moreover, I owe you. Well, I believe you, Teodoro. It would be strange if you didn't love your signora who did you so much good, who values you higher than other servants. I don't understand you! You must try to understand me. And never even think of overstepping the bounds of decency! Suppress your feelings, Teodoro. If such a noble lady favours you it's quite a lot to fill your life with happiness and honour. I must confess, signora, that your eloquence is more exciting than your mind! Excuse me, if I'm not polite. What are all these words for? As soon as I get calm and cold - you flare up like dry straws. As soon as I again start burning, you become as cold as ice. You could allow me to marry Marcela. But you are like the dog who lies on manger: you feel jealous if I decide to marry Marcela, but if I leave her for you, you torment me and shatter all my dreams. Eat it yourself or allow those to eat who can! No, Teodoro. Forget Marcela forever. You may take an interest in anyone but not in her. She will not return to you. Will not return? Will Your Grace stop our love with your own passion? Or you wish to make me love what I can't even hear about? Am I supposed to submit my will to yours? No. I adore Marcela. She loves me. And there is no shame in our love. You are a cheat! A rotter! I would like to kill you! But what are you doing? I'm slapping a rogue in the face! Signora, what is it? It's nothing. There are bad servants in any house. - Maybe I can do something for you? - You can. I'd like to tell you something. Maybe we can choose another moment? Why? This moment is quite suitable. Don't feel confused because of trifles. I would say this fury is provoked by something serious, not trifles. I'm always coming when all the things are over! - I'm like a cowardly hidden sword! - Alas, Tristan. There's blood on your handkerchief? The science of jealousy always comes with blood. The science which is not too much enjoyable. There is no wonder. The countess is going crazy because of love. But as she doesn't consider it proper to be sincere, she smashed my face. She broke the mirror in which her arrogance is reflected in its ugliness. When a Lucia quarrels with me or pulls out a lock of hair, or scratches my face and blames me for a deception, I can forgive her. For what can you expect from servants? But if a signora starts fighting... - What a shame! - I don't know. I cannot stand it anymore. Are you here? Signora. She's wandering like a ghost. I wanted to learn how you are. See for yourself. Are you feeling badly? No, I'm feeling well. You haven't added: I'm at your service. I can't be at your service... - ...if you are so cruel with me. - You know so little. So little that I can't make out what you want from me. I don't understand your words. But I can understand the sound of slapping. When I demonstrate my love for you - you get angry. And if I don't love you - you get angry, too. You want me to understand you - and if I do, I become a fool. Kill me or let me live. For I cannot suffer like this any more. I smashed your face to blood? You did, signora. Where is your handkerchief? - It's here. - Give it to me. - What for? - I need it. I want to have it with your blood. Go to Otavio, I ordered him to give you to thousand escudos. What for? For handkerchiefs. - I can't believe it. - She's never acted like that. She's giving you two thousand escudos. One can bear six more boxes on the ear for this money! She's ordered to sew a lot of handkerchiefs, and has taken mine with her. She's paying you with blood, though the newlywed here is your nostril. The dog has bitten painfully, that is why she's now fawning. You are my freind, you are my brother, we go on spree together! Don't get angry if I kick you - we are the birds of feather! Hey, hey, hey, hey - we are the birds of feather! I'm an expert at love matters, I know how to treat a lady! Though women think that I am too shady! Hey, hey, hey, hey - I am too shady! It's on you today. We need to drink to your new pants! Without further talking! Come on! This is just the beginning. I think that in this tavern they serve a perfect wine! Let's try a Greek one. Once you drink it, you'll start speaking Greek. These are the countess's suitors. Let's eavesdrop on them. She smashed his nose. - And you were present there? - Yes! She slapped him? With her own hand? It didn't look like a signora was angry with her servant. When such a woman - one needs to know my cousin's nature, - slaps a man on cheeks, it's clear what's behind her fury. Even if this charge is false, the duty to protect the honour of my family - requires that he must die. - Without any doubt. Even if she learns about it. How can we do it? It's quite easy. Many people earn by it. They take gold as the payment for their bloody business. If you order to such a rogue to do him in - he'll finish off him at once. Oh, I'm looking forward to it. This shameless man will get his prize. Look, it seems right what we need. I'm sure the heaven hears us. And sends us exactly what's required. What does your grace want from me? You have such courageous looks, and you seem so strong and bold. We wanted to ask you: can you murder somebody? Murder? Are you joking? I can kill anyone. We are not joking. Take my word. And you may earn a pretty sum. I don't ask more than two hundred escudos, even if it is a devil. I'll give you three hundred. But I need it done today. I need the name and earnest money. Do you know the countess de Belflor? Yes, I have some friends in this house. Can you kill her servant? I'm ready to kill all servants, all maids and even all her horses. No, you must kill only Teodoro. I'll have to use a special approach. I was told he doesn't go out in the evening or at night. He must be aware of your intentions. They called me to serve there as his guard. Please, let me agree. And I will stab him at a good moment. All right, serve to Teodoro, we agree. Now, give me one hundred escudos. - Take one hundred. - And even more. Well, your graces, I must take leave. My friends are waiting there Stake, Wallsmasher, Iron Hand and Devil's Throat. I don't want there to be a cause for rumours. You are right. Good bye. How lucky we are! You may already consider Teodoro dead. - A brave man! - And very careful! - He'll stab him skilfully. - Yes, no doubt. There is no other way to prolong your family. Camillo, I feel the pressure of my old age grow every day. Maybe, the aim to marry an old man is understandable. But still I want the reason to judge. I need to weigh it well at first. Because we can expect that I'm too old to have descendants. And I'll have to live with a young wife... And when a wife is young while her man is old, she's like an ivy hanging from the branches. Though it could twine with love both the stem and crown of a young tree. But my tree is withered. The reasoning like that stirs up sad memories of the past time. And makes me suffer again. It will be twenty years soon as I've been waiting for my Teodoro. Steel is obedient to a hammer, It's thrown out of the hot forge into ice. And as this torture is repeated A perfect sword is being born! Like steel, my heart is thrown into fire by promising and tender looks, And then it's tortured by being thrown back into the ice of haughtiness. And if I don't perish in the forge of passion, I'll only be strengthened by this torture! Signor, where are you going? I don't know my direction. The heart is hurt, I don't know where I'm going. Yesterday Diana was so sweet with me, today her passion vanished, she treats me as if we aren't acquainted. Which makes Marcela triumphant. Tristan, believe me, Diana didn't cheat when loved me. She would have married me long ago but for her honour, her family, her title. She's worried about her honour. Imagine, that by chance I found your noble father and brought here, and you became an equal with the countess, would you be happy with this news? Of course I would. And if I joined your hearts together, what would you say to that? I would say that you are the most dexterous man I've ever met. I see, now good bye. You'll see how faithful we are to you, when tomorrow you'll get engaged. Good bye, signor! What shall I do? I'm in discord with myself. But I've made a decision that will save us: I know that love will vanish if two hearts are divided by the sea. Are you feeling better, Teodoro? Have your sorrows fly away? They gave me so much happiness that I won't let them go. My torment is so sweet and pleasant, the sting that bit me is so tender, that I would grieve if all my wounds were healed. The only sorrow that makes me unhappy is that I must abandon her whom I love, forever. You must leave? But why? There are some people who want to see me dead. You are right. There are some people who feel envious of me. Will you allow me to sail to Spain, signora? A sensible and noble decision. And what tormented you will be forgotten in the foreign land. I will shed a lot of tears, of course, but my good name and honour will be saved. Since I slapped you in the face Count Federico is jealous of me, so it will be better for us both to part. Yes, you'd better go. You will be given six thousand in gold. I'm leaving to let the rumours die. I kiss your feet. It's time. Farewell, Teodoro. I'll be trying to forget you. What shall I do? Where is the answer? When will you leave? Please go! - I'm leaving. - Wait! No, go. - Listen! - I'm here, I'm waiting! No, go, please, go. I'm going away. Oh wicked passion, you are so cruel, you are more awful than revenge! Haven't you left? Now I have. Oh, how hard it is to bear! This honour of the family! An absurd thing that can deprive you of those who are dear to your heart. Who invented this? Still it's honour who saves us at the edge of precipice. I'm sorry, I have come to ask if I must leave today. I don't know, Teodoro. But believe me, to see you now is most painful to me. I've come to take myself from you. For I'm still here, but my ship leaves soon. I'm begging you, please, give myself to me. No, Teodoro, I won't return you. I'll keep you for myself. Go away. My love is now fighting with my honour! And you are preventing them from their fight! Go away. I will not return you to yourself. I'll keep you here, by my side. And me... I'll be there with you. May you be happy and keep your honour! If I could send it to the devil! If not this honour, I'd be able to be together with my love. So, now my eyes are covered with darkness and grief. And still there is a place for tears. He who didn't see too much, has many tears. My eyes! This is your punishment for looking at the forbidden subject. But that's not my guilt! Don't cry! Proud people hide their tears. Tears console only eyes. Still there's a place for tears. He who didn't see too much, sheds many tears! A Greek merchant is asking to visit Your Grace. Let him in. Let me kiss your hands to show my respect to you. May heaven be with you to help you realize your dreams. I'm glad to see you, signori. Did you arrive not long ago? Have you been here before? From Istanbul I headed for Cyprus. Then I visited Venice and brought there a lot of Persian clothes. I'm not only a merchant, I'm also occupied with the search. I also wanted to see the fabulous city of Naples. - Yes, Naples is rich and glorious. - Your Grace is right. My father was a famous merchant in Greece. The most profitable portion of his trade were slaves. Once he bought a boy, who was captured together with his countrymen on a Maltese ship. Camillo, my heart is sinking. My father took the boy with him to Armenia where we lived. And the boy was brought up together with my sister and me. Stop it. Wait a minute, my friend. You are killing me with your words. We got him. - What was the boy's name? - Teodoro. Good heavens! How much power words have over our soul. I cannot now hold my tears. My sister, Sapolitonia, and this boy grew up together. And as it happens, they fell in love with each other at a very young age. When they were about 16, my father was in foreign countries, and their love became too close. After some time my sister couldn't conceal what had happened from others' looks. And Teodoro, out of fears to be punished, soon ran away. My father was upset not with the sister's shame, but with Teodoro's escape. Quite disappointed, he soon deceased. I've approached the subject. On coming to Naples, I started to ask all people I met about Teodoro. - And suddenly... - What? A maid in my hotel, who is a Greek herself, told me that this boy might be Count Ludovico's son. I decided that I must see you and talk to you by all means. I started to look for Your Grace's house. By some mistake I was directed to the house of Countess de Belflor. As soon as I entered the house, I met there... - My heart is trembling. -...Teodoro! Teodoro! He wanted to hide himself at first, but I caught him. At first I had some hesitations. For time may change the face a lot. After all he started to speak to me. Without confusion. He asked me to keep it secret, to tell nobody everything I know. But I couldn't keep it from you. Let me give you a hug. My soul is rejoicing, I believe your every word, for it's true! Oh, my son! My dear son! I got you back after all these years of bitter separation! Camillo! What shall I do? Shall I hurry to see him? Yes, rush to him, and after all these years of suffering embrace him! My friend, if you wish to go with me, I will be happy! Probably, you'd like to rest? Please, stay here and have a rest. My house fully is at your disposal, feel at home. And I cannot wait. I'll only take diamonds - I left them in the hotel - and come back here, to your house. So, we have to leave you. Merkamponios. Let's go, master. - Naichelnakh non silly sos? - Yes raitos. - Lets gossos? - Lets gossos. What an amazing language! Hurry up, Camillo! Have you prepared for the journey yet? I wish I had a pair of wings on my boots instead of spurs. Don't you feel sad to leave? Why not? A little. - He's leaving, take my word! - Are you still jealous? Look, Teodoro. - I'm here, signora. - Oh, what a torment! Are you leaving? I love you! I'm a victim of people's judgement. My tyrant is the Red Blood of mine. Have I not struggled enough? - Are you crying? - No, there's something in my eye. - Maybe, it's love? - Yes, I suppose. It's trying to get out, to find a way. I'm going to foreign lands, but I leave my heart with you. Do you have an order for me to carry out for you? I'm sick at heart. I'm going to foreign lands, but I leave my heart with you. Are you crying? No. There's something in my eye and it's hurting me. Maybe, my suffering? I would be glad to steal this suffering from you. I prepared some trinkets for you. I'm sorry, everything I found are valueless things. Still take them to foreign lands. And when you watch them glistening on your garments remember me, and think of all the tears glistening in the eyes of poor Diana. Or marvellous Diana, the delight of the old man's heart will be my strong excuse for intruding here without the announcement! What is the matter, dear Count? You are the only person who doesn't know yet the news! This news has spread all over the city of Naples! I hardly made my way through the crowd, hurrying to see my son! What son, signor? And why are you so glad? Haven't you ever heard my story, that twenty years ago I sent my son with his tutor to Malta? And that he was captured by the pirates of Ali-Pasha? Of course I heard about your misfortune. Today I have been blessed to get my dear son back after many years. Signor, I am so happy that you gifted me with joyful news. And I'm expecting, signora, that you'll gift me with my son, who serves to you and is so far indifferent to his native house. If only his mother were alive to experience this happiness! He serves to me? Who is it? Fabio? No, he isn't Fabio. He's Teodoro. Who? Teodoro? Yes. What does it mean? Teodoro, is Count your father? Is it him? Signor, let Your Grace think it over! What should I think about, my son? That I'm going to see my fatal hour in your embrace? Incredible! My Lord, signora, Teodoro has turned out to be a true caballero! Signor, I am confused and lost. Am I your son? Even if I were not certain, it would be enough for me to look at you, my son. When I was young, I was exactly like you. I kiss your feet and I'm begging you... Don't speak! I'm not myself today. What handsome appearance! The nature itself gives us the proof that you are the heir of a noble family! Let's go, my son. Accept and own the house of your ancestors and their wealth! Enter the gates adorned with the most respectable coat of arms in Naples! Signor, I was going to leave for Spain today. For Spain? Here is your Spain - it's my embrace! Count, I'm asking you to allow Teodoro to recover and to change to more appropriate attire to pay his filial duty to you. I don't want him to go out of here when there are so many people in the street. There is a lot of reason in your words. It's a torment for me to part with him even if it's only for a moment. But there may be too much ado, so I'm leaving now and asking you to allow him to enter my house before the night falls. I give you my word. My son, I'm eager to see you later. I kiss your feet. Oh, Camillo! Now I can die quietly. Your Teodoro is so handsome! I'm afraid even to think of it! I am about to lose my mind! Signor, please, grant us with the honour to kiss your hands! And don't take it as flattery. Oh, Count, don't look so surly. You should embrace us all. And we'll be all yours and at your service. Give me the way! Move out! And stop talking so much nonsense! With reverence, signor, I kiss your hands. Since this day I'm your slave, and I am at your dearest feet. What are you staring at? Leave us for half an hour! - What is it, Fabio? - It's a miracle! - What's next? - You know, of course. Our signora won't sit like a dog on manger anymore. - She'll finally eat it. - To tease her suitors. Ah, blast her! May she swell and burst! Now you don't have to leave. - Me? - You. Don't you want to sigh: I'm going to foreign lands, but I leave my heart with you? Does my sudden nobility seem funny and make you laugh? Rejoice! There is no more inequality between us, so you mustn't scoff! - Oh, you have changed. - I'm sure, now I'm lost for you. It's hard for you to realize that we are equal, you loved a servant. It was a pleasure for you to dominate even in love. I'll tell you only one thing: Now you are mine! For life, forever! And you will marry me today! Oh, stop this moment of bliss! I am the happiest woman in the world! Now, go, you need to change, you're being waited for. I'll go to see my house, and my father. Although nobody proved that he is right. - So, good bye, Count! - Countess! - Wait. - What is it? Where is my grace? You cannot answer like that to a signora. But Your Grace has forgotten that now I'm the master. But who am I? My wife. And you must obey me. There's nothing else to wish! Stop this bliss! Like Teodoro says: stop! Stop! It's easy to forget about your friends among this fuss and joy. But why do you think that I forgot about you? You didn't even send to tell us that you servant is a nobleman. Now you may learn it firsthand that Teodoro is a count and my husband. Hey, you, Stake, wait! Or what do they call you? My true name is Thrust. It's not a speaking name. It would confirm my reputation if my dead man didn't turn into a count. What's the difference for you? When we decided on three hundred I was going to kill the servant, not Teodoro the Nobleman. Count Teodoro costs differently. You must pay more. A count is more expensive! How much do you want? Only we need it to be done today! - One thousand escudos. - You will get them. - Then prepare the money. - I need to fetch it. And I'll take this time to thrust him in his side. - You two listen. - You want more? Don't tell anyone! Tristan, what have you done? I'm afraid it can end badly. Look! I received a thousand for killing you. - I'm too worried. - If you heard me you'd pay me even more than those two fools. I'm oppressed by fears. If everybody learns about your cheat, there will be so many troubles, compared to which hanging is a trifle! If you think about this all the time... You are a devil! The devil incarnate! Let everything go as it does, and then we'll see what we can do. - It's the countess. - I must hide myself. Haven't you visited your father? Signora. I'm oppressed by doubts. And I've decided to ask you for the permission to leave for Spain. Isn't it because Marcela is interfering again? Marcela? No! Then what is it? Signora, my poor tongue won't dare to disturb your ears with it! It may concern my honour, but Teodoro, tell me, please. Tristan, who's the loyal servant of lies and cheat, invented a story about me, finding out that Ludovico's son is missing. But I'm nobody! A poor foundling! My only father is my brains, my zeal for science and my pen. Count Ludovico has admitted that I'm his heir. And I could become your husband, I could live in glory and roll in money, but my heart is noble and doesn't allow me to deceive you. I am an honest man by nature, that is why I'm asking you to permit me to leave and to save my lady's love, her honour and her perfection. All this is both wise and silly. It's wise to be sincere and noble and honest. But it's silly to think that I am also a fool. And that I'll leave you when there's a chance for you to rise. It's not a title that makes you happy. Our bliss is in the chance to realize our dreams and hopes. I'll be your wife. Let's go, my son, into our house that has been longing for you. Let's go there where you were born! While we are here, in this house, Count, I want to tell you that I'm his wife. Oh Fortune, strengthen your wheel with golden nails! Stop, bliss! Dreaming to find one child, I found two! Here, the honourable audience... I hope, nobody will reveal Teodoro's secret. ...we will end the story about the dog who's lying on the manger. Once there'll be a day When love will come to you Whether you know where you'll meet it or not. Obscure is the path of love Its face is mysterious, its language is unknown But when it comes, You'll know that it's love at once Once there'll be a day when love will come to you - you'll never miss it Oppose it or fight it, escape it or prepare for it - it will have its time It may come like a dawn, or like a thunderstorm - you'll never hear it step Your ear may deceive you, your eyes may tell you lies, but your heart is always true.
