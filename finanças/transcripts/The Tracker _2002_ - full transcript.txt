Far away in another life... I walked my land, proud and free... Far away from my other life... Searching alone... Far away from home. Far away in those distant lands... Life's hard, but living is good There the hunt leaves no blood on mine... there I rode home... Where the sun warmed the deepest fold... and the rain sleeps on rocks so old... And the night falls and stories told... I'd like to be... ...wandering free. But they don't know the pain in me... 'cause they can't know what I can see... I'm surrounded by a misery... I'd like to be... Always free... Far away home... Far away in another land... I walked my saunt proud and free... Now I'm torn from that distant land... I'm going home. About half a day ahead, Boss. And he's gettin' tired. tell me when it gets too dark C'mon...get going! O.K. Boss... Like this? He doesn't believe him, does he? He believes him. C'mon Boss! Here... My mother is a lady She lives in Aralagrand My father is Chief Justice He rules over all the land And I'm just a copper Who roams over rocks and sand Shut that, will you! It's "The Copper's Lament" It's doggerel. They could be all around... we wouldn't hear them. Wouldn't hear 'em anyway. Stealthy black buggers. They 'round. We'll lose him if he gets to his tribe. Not even our dusky friend could help us then. No worries, Boss... He's not from 'round here. What's he doing here then? Escaping natural justice. They go into enemy territory... to protect their own tribe... ...from the likes of us. We won't get 'im. They'll stay in the bush... blacks will. No worries, Boss. Not get us, too. Too right! Bad times are here... Trouble's comin'... What am I doin' here? Waiting... Have to face up to that... Someone like me... Who must carry the burden... alone. What am I doing here?... Waiting to stand... Waiting only until the right time. It turns ahead... It sounds like some dead animal being strangled. Dead animals don't make sounds. No!...they don't... Yeah...you know what I mean... What's up? How far ahead is he? He a long way, Boss. How far? Half a day. Maybe more. Chasin' shadows! - How would he know anyway? - He knows! How are we ever going to catch him? He was half a day ahead yesterday. And maybe more today. We'll catch him. Because we won't stop until we do. And he'll stop. He could be around the next bend... fast asleep under a tree. Yeah...right, Boss. He's not half a day ahead... We half a day behind. C'mon, Boss! We'll find a track. Bush blackfella, Boss! What y're asked is what you find. Why don't we get up higher... where the ground's more open. Yeah...that's good... Be easy to follow those tracks from up there! Oh...yeah. Just watch your arse! They're peaceful, Boss. He's not there with them. I want them alive. Trooper's uniform. Let's find out what this is all about. What a different language. Everybody ready? In this land long ago We lived our own way... Now we're no longer free... We are dispossessed... ...people of mine. You came to be in possession... ...of a trooper's uniform This...this...! ...they're my people... my people... Well spoken! Nice to have a cobber that speaks English! These are your best friends out here... ...and you must use them, too. Sic transit gloria mundi... "The sun passes the glorious world". They're cannibals... Very treacherous... You have to be firm with them... They'll kill a white man in broad daylight. Leave him alone. He's had enough. Kid...the government employs me for a certain duty... ...supply me with men, rifles and revolvers... ...ammunition in abundance... They expect me to use them... ...for the benefit of the country. Too much bulldust yacking boss... We gotta keep after the other savage... We'll hoist it in the morning. It's alright, Boss. Now it's that sting... as an innocent Black... The only innocent Black is a dead Black. Too steep...you're better off the horses. Dismount! Under attack!... The supplies... It's gonna be half a day getting them out of there. We're pushing on. Be a hungry trip, then. Let's go! Guns at the ready. There's no point dwelling on it. We're perfectly capable. You think so, eh? Yes I do. But I'm not gonna let any black bastard get the better of me. We better keep going, Boss... That tribe back there... Be stirred up now... Might be another spear... ...come flying straight through you. Some men are prone to misadventure... Questions of guilt aren't always clear... Some men run from a state they can't avoid... Our men choose the path they want. Some can't be faulted for their reasons... They need to just be intervened. Some men hide from the memories that haunt... Our men choose the path they want. Some men see everything to duty... Cast off responsibilities... Some regret, yet their courage sometimes saves. Our men choose the path they want. Some men have attitude that's righteous... Care not about the consequence... Some men fight with devout ends in sight. Some men choose the path they walk Some men have reached their destination... Finding their own serenity... Some men lead others to they'll recognise... That all men choose the path they walk. Was here last night, Boss. He had a woman with him. See...the bloody bush-Blacks are helping him. I'm not sure about that, Boss... Him and that woman been jiggity-jig. You know, Boss... "Jiggity-jig!" He's too young! You're not telling me everything... How come he's still half a day ahead? He have no horse, Boss... He travelled fast... in the bush Are we so slow that he has time even to satisfy his unholy desires with others of his repulsive breed? I don't know what to say, Boss. Did you understand what I said? See this man... This man...for a white man... displays a particularly low level of intelligence... But he understands what you can't... ...BECAUSE he's a white man... do you understand? Don't get smart with me! You're a monkey! Yes Boss...I'm a monkey. If I ever catch him... ...it'll be YOUR ears I'll take back with me. You see...you HAVE to be firm with the natives. Otherwise they think you're afraid. Then they won't hesitate to take advantage. He might've got hungry back here. Suppose you're right... Should've kept a better lookout. And you shouldn't have killed those natives. If you're considering mutiny... you may well be next. No...no... Just complaining... As is my right. You do know the penalty for falling asleep at your post... Sure you can handle it? I'm not an idiot. The blackfella's gone. What? The blacktracker... he just disappeared. What are we gonna do now? Oh...don't worry... he'll be back. No wonder we've how many others. Hey!...Whitefella bush tucker, Boss. I don't know what you're up to... but you're not doin' it again! Fasten him to a tree! I'm sorry... Sorry... You want to feel sorry for someone?... Feel sorry for the packhorse. Now there's an innocent victim. This one...don't waste your sentiment on HIM!... He won't appreciate it. They were no longer free... We lived bound by chains... No more our lands...wandering This where we're going to... I see something, Boss. People... Not sure. ...in chains. All right...keep moving. Over there, Boss! I seen something. Some dumb blackfellas... Sure they slippery. Chained like a dog... Now I see them! Plenty trouble coming, Boss. What does that mean? That means plenty trouble coming. We're getting closer to that fella, Boss. Maybe...couple of hours. About friggin' time. What's your problem. You don't honestly believe him, do you? Anyone can see he's not really tracking. He's just following his nose... ...and hoping for the best. Is that right?... He'll show you. Well, get off your horse... He's not going to climb up there with you. There, Boss. There...where? I don't see anything. That stone was missing. There's millions of stones. There!... That stone belong there, Boss. It's been kicked away. About 2 hours ago. Nearly dry now. Is that all you need? Yes, Boss. It's enough. Plenty sign like this. Sorry. Better not go on, Boss. Why not? Third fella missing off the horse. He must've been thrown. No, Boss... He's been speared. What!? I heard the spear whispering through the air. Back there. Well, why didn't you tell me? I thought YOU was on the lookout. Rifle!... Go and find him! He's coming, Boss. I'm in 'trouble coming' all right! We'll need some bandages. There's some in my saddlebag. We'll have to go back... Freedom grasps opportunities... If to live in harmony... But how can we be ever free... If we let the white man be. It's a contradiction... It's a contradiction if you're a black man... It's a contradiction... It's a contradiction if you're a white man... Freedom... Freedom... Serving them whilst freedom waits. One shrieks...another pays. It's a contradiction... It's a contradiction if you're a black man... It's a contradiction... It's a contradiction if you're a white man... Freedom... Freedom... Freedom Freedom... We'll have to stop... Why do we have to stop? Can't be our problem... We've got a job to do. Aren't you supposed to look after your men? Isn't that part of your job as well? We have to leave him behind. He's slowing us down too much. Let's go. Don't go... I won't make it if you do. Please!... You can't sentence a man to certain death... just to catch a blackfella! You are to come with me! That's an order! He can do what he likes... Do you understand? Do you understand?! Don't leave me... Far away in another life... We'd all look out for each one... Can't believe their life matters now... I'd like to be... ...far away...home. What's going on? We're waiting for him to catch up, Boss. Move! My God, I'll whip you, if you don't get moving! I said move! He's not going to! And without him... we can't catch the other one. I'll go back and get him. See if I can't hurry him up a bit. You'll stand trial when we get back... Disobeying orders in a field of conflict. Yes, Boss. You'll probably hang. Yes, Boss. Poor blackfella...been born for that noose...eh? Too right! What is it, this time? That's sacred country there, Boss. No good at night... We go across morning. That other blackfella... no go there, too. We can push on a bit... The sooner we catch him... the sooner we'll get back. No. No...he's useless... no point trying. Once the spirits get into them... No. We'll camp back there tonight. Ego te absolvo... a peccatis tuis... in nomine Patris, et Filii... et Spiritus Sancti... Amen. I'm not sure, Boss. Maybe there. Maybe down there, Boss. Why would he go down there? I don't know, Boss... Thirsty?! Maybe drink water... Why always up and down? Why always the rough ground? Can't help where that blackfella goes. You black bastard...! I'm gonna kick your arse! Sorry, Boss! I can't swim! Need some space, Boss... These horses...they're covering his tracks. I have no doubt... that you tried to kill me down there. One more false move... and I'll return the compliment. No hard feelings, Boss. Are you okay? Bring me that other bloody horse! Drop the gun! There are innocent women and children... Drop the gun! What are you thinking? Shut up! Now give me your revolver. Now...get off your horse. Get off! Now lie down! No! They'll have you for this. I'm your superior officer... This is mutiny! You'll hang... Stand up! Stand up! Now... We're going to go on... ...and capture this fugitive that we've been after. Then you...and he...will both stand trial for murder. If you behave between now and then... I'll testify to that. I might just recommend leniency. You are a DEAD man... I'm your only way out of here!... You'll die in here!... You won't survive without me! I'm in charge! They'll give me a medal for it. And they'll hang that blackfella!... I'll see to that. And you... They will flog you... ...to the very edge of existence. Get some bush tucker now, Boss. We nearly had him, eh Boss?... Nearly caught that bastard savage today. Black bastard's probably trying to poison us. I want yours. See!... Treacherous bastard...he won't do it... proves my point! Good tucker, Boss. I must admit I've come across 1 or 2 natives during my travels... ...who were good. I once worked with a tracker I could trust. I mean really trust... As a white man can be trusted. He was full-blood like you. Not one of these half-castes... who seem to take on the worst characteristics of both races... No...he was a man... And he was a splendid tracker... ...like you. He never failed me... Over stones...through spinifex... over high ranges... Swamps and long grass... And if he ever lost the tracks for a few minutes... ...his instinct would direct him... And on he'd go. And he understood that we whites are here for a purpose... That tradition points to the fact... that the natives were once better than they are. They've deteriorated in their moral worth...and if... If they're not taken in hand, then... They'll be worse than ever. Well, this black tracker... Despite his natural-born ignorance... Well, he figured I was the man for the job, and... He may well be right. You could not serve Almighty God any better... ...than by improving the poor degraded creatures. I've seen that the Blacks can be made tractable and docile... But you have to be both firm and kind with them. And you can teach them to work for their own interest. You can impress upon their minds that they mustn't kill each other... They must not kill the squatter's cattle... they must... ...do unto others as they would wish themselves to be done by... And they must speak the truth... now... ...if I were given the resources, then I would establish... ...a chain of ration depots...I... I'd collect the Blacks...and I'd feed and clothe the old and infirm... And some of the others at times... I would raise their condition... all of their conditions... ...by diplomacy and kindness. It's a dream I have. My tracker's still alive... Pretty old now, but doing well... I see him from time to time... ...when I'm in town. I helped him get a little cottage on the outskirts... ...and he lives their quietly with his gin. I taught him the white way... and he's a happy man. He owns ports, he says. "Hey, Boss...how's it goin'?" "When are you gonna teach all those other Blacks the proper way to live?" And it hurts me to have to tell him "Not yet." Not...yet. But then I quote him a little poem... And he's happy again. The world is full of beauty... And other worlds above... And if we do our duty... It might be full of love. Now I don't know if any of that means anything to you... But if it does, I'd like you to think upon it... You are charged with the murder of innocent people... How do you plead? Who the hell are you? On behalf of my people... and all people... I'm your judge and jury... How do you plead? Wake up! I find you guilty as charged. By your action, you have forfeited the right to live... among your fellow humans. I sentence you to hang by the neck until dead. You can't do that! Sic transit gloria mundi. No...the bastard... The glorious world. Ego te absolvo a peccatis tuis... You have taken my country... Fought me, killed me... exterminated by your hand... I have longed of my being... Empty, derided for decades in what was my land... And I can never return... Until there's contrition... And we can learn... Read my history. I belong for my country... I still remember the spirit that lives in my land... But I can only forgive... When there is contrition... Where we at last face my history. And so I will only forgive... When there is contrition... And I can chain down my history. Come on! Here I am! Come and get me! Got me plurry big headache, Boss. I guess we should take him down. And...ah...bury him... best we can. Been Laptisa warning to the white fellas, Boss. Got to leave him. Don't want us to stir 'em up... them Blacks any more. Right... You're right... We better go after that blackfella, Boss. Now. Right. Good...eh, Boss? I think we should stop for a rest. Too many blackfellas around here, Boss We want to keep goin'. I'm convinced very close now, Boss. No! We better go with them, Boss. See what they want. He wants your rifle, Boss. You better give him now! No way I'm giving him the gun. You listen to me carefully... You do what I tell you to do... ...and you won't do anything that I don't tell you to do. That way...you will survive. Give the man your rifle. That's the man, Boss. He says he not kill a white woman, Boss. Him far away...when she killed. We should take him in. We have to take him in. He can tell that to the court. The court already find him guilty, Boss. Blackfella... He can't get to it anyway. Why? Why did you do that? You said he was innocent. Tribal justice, Boss. He'd broken the law. Aboriginal law. Back at the waterhole... With the woman... He rape her. She's wrong skin for him. But you're a Christian. I heard you give absolution. God respects aboriginal law... ...as much as He respects whitefella's law. Maybe more. Now if you want to stay alive... You better be quiet... ...and follow me. Them blackfellas... Probably cooked him and ate him. You know... We all cannibals. You wait here... I get them horses. Horses!? They cut up the creek. So...you can ride? I suppose you can swim, too? You know how to get back? I think so. My land is far away, Boss. But always I can find it. I wonder who did kill that woman. Probably whitefella, Boss... Shifty...thieving... ...dishonest mob! Can't trust 'em one bit. Always I've hope... For my struggle... Have to keep roving on... Do all that can be done... Searching for one... Who will carry the burden within me. With hopes, on we head... Until we find a way... For all of them... To respect what we say... But...and then... It's not our shame... Chain our hands...take our land... We stay. That's where our future goes... Searching for those... Who will carry the burden with us... All ways lead home.
