Say Jesse, how 'bout you talk Danielle out of being mad at me? And both of y'all hop in the car with me and Vince here, and we can all take a spin into Dallas. - We got school tomorrow, stupid. - Oh come on, Jesse. We'll be back before anybody gets in any real trouble. Y'all know Vince? This here is Vince Harding. Vince, this is Jesse, and that one's Dan. Dan's a little mad at me right now. - I'm not mad at you, John Jaegerman. I'm just bored with you. - Jesse, will you tell Dan that she's the only girl I'll ever love? - [Danielle] Jesse, will you tell John to please think about that the next time he decides to steal a car? - [John] They didn't even press any charges. They knew I was just goofing around. - What about you, Mr. Vince? Do you talk? - I know a joke. - [Jesse] Well let's hear it. - Okay. There's these two monks, alright? There's like a regular monk guy. - [William Voiceover] My mother didn't need to hear the joke. She was already dead bull's eye in love. She listened to the sound of his voice, thinking what a good father he'd make. - And the guy says, "Well, I'm not much into fish, "but I sure am gonna love working with you fuckin' guys". - Come on, Dan, let's go to Dallas. ♪ Now I'm stuck here ♪ ♪ Looking by ♪ ♪ Where I lost a friend ♪ - [Jesse] It's a nice car. - [Vince] It's just a 'Cuda.

I was thinking a lot about that story. I wondered if sex was easier in Texas than it was in New York. (applause) (slow guitar music) I wondered how my father had talked to my mother.

You know, I mean, should we go to the brothel, or should we go to the church? Let's go to the theater. - Sarah doesn't think men have vaginas. - Yeah, well, I agree with her. - What? - I said, I don't have a vagina. - Yeah, you do. - Hi, I'm William. I'm an actor, so I'm totally full of shit. Don't believe a word I say. I just figured I should tell you that right off the bat so you don't get disappointed later. You ever see "Star Trek"? The original one? Well, I'm kind of like Spock in that episode where he tells the replicants that everything he says is a lie. And they go, "If everything you say is a lie, "then you're lying right now, "which means you're telling the truth, "which means you're lying." And then smoke comes out of their ears, and they malfunction, and he gets to escape. See, you just seem a little stiff to me, and I'm trying to make sure you're not a replicant. Do you speak English? - (laughs) Yes. - [William] Ah, good, I was worried you didn't understand a word I say. - Don't worry, you're not that complicated. - What? - [Sarah] You're not that complicated. - Ah, thanks. ♪ For you to hide ♪ - Are you nervous? - No, I'm not nervous. Why would I be nervous? ♪ When you know that I care ♪ Okay, I'm nervous all the time. I don't know why. - Me too. ♪ One day, the dam will break. ♪ So, you're really an actor, huh? - Yeah. Yeah I got an audition for the movie version of "Camino Real" tomorrow. You ever read that play? - No. - Tennessee Williams. - Mm mm. - Me neither. My lines are good, though, I read them. - Well, don't you have to read the whole play? - Yeah, I guess I should, huh? I tried, it's just really weird. It's about a bunch of people unhappy 'cause they're not sure if they're living or they're dead. - Why do you want to be an actor? - I don't, really. It's just the only thing I've ever really been good at. - I want to be a singer. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. - You gonna be a star? - I want to be a musician. - Okay, that's cool. - I don't want to be famous, you know? I like to sing. I want to do what I love. - Are you any good? - It's not important. Are you any good? - I'm great. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. I'm tellin' you, there's nothin' I can do about it. I'm just great. (laughter) - Okay, well, do something for me. - My heart is gold. What will you give me for it? (laughter) - What's that? - Tennessee. I'm just whoever I pretend to be. You ever feel like that? Like all you are is the person you were pretending to be in high school? - Uh, no. But don't worry, you are somebody. If you'd stop pretending, it'll come out all by itself. - Do you want to get married? - No. - I don't want to be an actor. It's a little disappointing when your best quality is pretending to be someone else. I want to be somebody specific, you know? I was born in Texas. But I left there when I was eight. And sometimes, I think if I had just stayed, I could be a regular person, you know? Billy, the lumber guy, or whatever. Instead of running around with my head cut off. - Why'd you leave Texas? - My mom had wanderlust. - What about your dad? - I don't really know him. - Don't smoke that. - Why not? - Because I'm thinking about kissing you. - Okay. Good to know. It's good to know. - [Sarah] So you're gonna be a big movie star, huh? - [William] Yeah, it's my destiny. - [Sarah] (laughs) God, you're unbelievable. - [William] I try to be. Born yesterday, but I stayed up all night. - This is my door. - You live here? - [Sarah] Yeah. - No shit, really? - That's my window. (Sarah laughs) My window looks out on your front door. - Well, I just got to New York City tonight. I'm staying with a friend. - Come here, come here, come here. Do me a favor, stand right here. - Okay. - Right there, just like that. - Why? - That's good, one second. - I feel weird. (laughs) What am I doing here? What? (mellow music) (Sarah laughs) (mellow music) - [William Voiceover] Looking out at what was now her door, I had the profound feeling that my life had changed. And I was right, not in the way I had thought. I hadn't met the woman I was to grow gray with. I was 20 years old, and by the time I was 21, I'd be heartbroken. (mellow music) - [Sarah] Hi. - [William] Nice to see you. What's your name again? - You don't remember my name? - I'm kidding. - Oh my God, did I do that? - [William] Yeah. - Are you mad? - No. - Do you do that all the time? - [William] Do what? - Kiss girls. - Hey Sarah, we're gonna start in about 10 minutes, alright? Is she okay? - I think something's wrong with her microphone. - [Dave] I'll get it. - [William] Hey Sarah? That dude said he'd take care of the microphone business. What? - Come here. I'm behaving ridiculously. - [William] Yeah, you are. - [Sarah] I'm sorry about the hickey thing. - [William] It's A-okay. - [Sarah] Hmm. (heavy breathing) (kissing) I should go now. - [William] Okay. Good luck. - Okay. - [William] Just pretend you're someone else. - What? - Think of your favorite singer, and just start out by pretending to be her. The rest'll come easy, and it'll secretly be you. - Can I borrow your jacket? - Uh. - Come on buddy, take off your jacket. Come on, it's hot as hell in here, man. Come on buddy, take off your jacket. Now listen to me, William, your mother and you are moving away. And I can't come after you. I can't, because I can't. You know I'm going to try to get some money together and visit you as much as I can, but it won't be as often as I want, all right? But it's killing me, all right? I mean, it's, it's really killing me. And I want you to remember one thing. (train whistle blows) Can you hear me? Just remember one thing. I am not the one leaving Texas, all right? Will you remember that? Come on, take off your jacket. (mellow music) ♪ Some time when we meet up yonder ♪ ♪ We'll stroll hand in hand again ♪ ♪ In the land that knows no parting ♪ ♪ Blue eyes crying ♪ ♪ In the rain ♪ (applause) - That's my jacket. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna buy a car, an old silver one with a big dashboard, and drive you down to Nashville. Take you to the Grand Ole Opry, and make you a big motherfucking star. - Can I sing Johnny Cash? - Are you kidding? Why don't you move in with me? - I came to New York to be on my own. - I'll move out. Sorry. - I found my own place. But I'll stay with you until my lease starts, if you want. - I want. Yeah, it'll be good. - But I won't have sex with you. - Why not? - Because I have a scar right here. - That's okay. I got lots of scars. - Okay, then I'll sleep over. - [William] But you won't have sex with me. - [Sarah] I'll have sex with you when I have my own apartment. - [William] So it's kind of like an audition? - [Sarah] Yeah. - [William] I hope I get a callback. (Sarah laughs) - [William Voiceover] It was Wednesday when we met, Saturday when I asked her to move in, and by Sunday there were flowers in my apartment, and hummus in my refrigerator. I don't remember waking up that Sunday. I don't think I ever slept. I just sat there thinking, God damn, this must be what praying is like. (slow guitar music) (Sarah singing in foreign language) - [William] All right, ma'am, where would you like this? - Yay. (squeals) You really got that part? - I really did. - You're really gonna be in a movie. That's awesome. - Yeah, we leave for Mexico in a month. That's where we're shootin' it. - Oh cool, Mexico. That sounds like fun. You know what we should do? We should paint. - [William] Aren't you sleepy? - [Sarah] No, I think we should paint. - [William] Alright. (woman singing in foreign language) - Well, what do you want to do? - You know what I want to do. But painting's okay. (woman singing in foreign language) What's your shirt say? - Oh. I love to fuck. (woman singing in foreign language) Does that make you feel tough? - It does. - Well, you better get serious about your painting, because we're not gonna go to bed tonight 'til this whole apartment is blue. You're the type of boy who gets girls pregnant. Do you know that? - Yeah, my mother used to say that all the time. - [Sarah] You should think of me as very fragile. I just didn't want to be feeling this way right now. - [William] How do you feel? - [Sarah] Don't play dumb. I'm here to be on my own. I'll probably just run away and leave you crushed. - [William] Nah, you can't hurt me. That's the problem. You just got to stick around and hear the jokes. - [Sarah] Oh brother. (mellow music) (Sarah sings in foreign language) - [William] Do you know how dumb I feel? - [Sarah] What do you mean? - [William] When you're thinking about sex like 24 hours a day, it significantly deteriorates your intelligence. (fake cries) - [Sarah] You know what? We should have done it that first night. That first night we kissed, I wanted to sleep with you. You're just giving me too much time to think. - I didn't think it was gonna be a one shot deal. - Oh, come on. - When's it gonna get ugly? When's it gonna get abusive? - I don't know, but it always does. - What kind of shit do you think we'll say about each other after we break up? - Frigid bitch. - All he thinks about is himself. - She's really still just a child. - He doesn't ever listen. - Oh, she's completely without talent. - Oh, he calls himself an actor? What a phoney. (Sarah laughs) Isn't it strange that'll happen? I'll come in here one night, "Listen, we got to talk". - What is it? - It's just I've been thinking and-- - And what? - I just need a little space is all. - Space for what? - Look, don't make this any harder than it is. I don't make you happy, you don't make me happy. - Yes, yes, you do. We can work this out, I love you. You're seeing someone else. - No, don't say that, it doesn't matter. - Who is it? - It doesn't matter. - Who is it? - See, I can't even talk to you. - Who is it, who is it? I always knew you didn't care about me. You just needed someone to talk at. I could have been any girl. - Now, don't go feeling sorry for yourself. The point is, it's over. It was fun, but I'm just not boyfriend material, you know? - Okay. I think we have to stop now because, oh my God, I'm so stupid. I'm so stupid. I can't do this with you. - We were joking. - [Sarah] I can't do that. - It was a dumb game. - [Sarah] I don't what a boyfriend right now. - Don't start having some self-fulfilling prophecy that I'm gonna hurt you. - [Sarah] I promised myself I wasn't gonna do this. - Listen, if you could be inside my body when I see you, or touch you, or think that I might see you or touch you, you would stop crying and slap me, because I'm either crazy about you, or I'm going crazy. - You are crazy. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. - Well, if you don't say, "I'm gonna to get over "my stupid hang-ups and fall desperately in love", I'm gonna jump off this bed. - [Sarah] I'm not gonna say that. - Say it! - [Sarah] I don't have any stupid hang-ups. - Oh, you better say it! - You know what, just, just stop. - Ah. (grunts) Ah! - Are you okay? - (grunts) Say you're falling desperately in love with me, and I'll come back to life. - No. (William grunts) What do you even mean by love? - I'm dying. - You're not dying. - Say you desperately want to kiss me passionately, and I'll come back to life. - Ah. I desperately want to kiss you passionately. (laughs) - A tragedy narrowly averted. - [Sarah] Come here. - [William Voiceover] I knew what was happening. And it was nice, but it wasn't what I wanted. (upbeat music) - Yo Kilroy, you big boxing bastard, get over here. - [Older Man] I remember winning that, spring of '79. - I wasn't born yet. - Look, I'm not saying you look bad. I'm just saying, I wish you were wearing a dress. I personally find you more attractive in a dress. I'm not saying that to be mean, but you asked. And yes, I wish you were in a dress. - I felt like wearing jeans tonight. - [Decker] So wear jeans. - [Kim] Do you want me to go home and change? - [Decker] Would I prefer that, yes. - You are such a shit. I can't believe you're friends with him. - Hey man, you went out with her first. - (laughs) Hey, this is Sarah. - Oh hey, good to meet you. Don't judge me too quickly. My mother killed herself when I was 12, so I have a lot of issues with women that I'm still trying to work out. But I also have some positive attributes, unfortunately, none of which will be revealed this evening because I am extremely inebriated. - Alright, man. - Did your mother really kill herself? - She was exactly like Sylvia Plath, without the publishing contract. - All right. - I'm trying to make you laugh. Alright, man, I got to show you something. - Alright, it's alright. - What the hell are we all doing? Why is nobody setting themselves on fire? I would set myself on fire, except you know, I don't think alleged President George Bush deserves it. I don't think he deserves my whole body. I think he deserves one singed ball. - [Older Man] "Sagebush Trail", 1933, you ever seen it? - [Drunk Man] Come on, kiss her. - [Older Man] I was actually there when he died. - [Blonde Woman] You were there? - Yeah, yeah, I'll never forget it. Me and my buddy Danny, we had just come from a baseball game. We're standing in line at McDonald's, and there was this old guy, like right in line in front of us. This old man, he was just crying, just sobbing. I looked over at him, and I said, "You okay, Mister?" He looked back at me, with tears, and he was like, "Didn't you hear? "John Wayne died today." - [Blonde Woman] Yeah? - John Wayne had died. It wasn't some numbnut, it was John Wayne. - Well, I'm a vegetarian. - [Older Man] Actually, I'm thinking about being a vegetarian. - I'm Samantha. - Hi. - So, are you William's girlfriend? - Um, I guess. I mean, we're just friends. - [Samantha] Cool. Where are you from? Your accent is just so beguiling. - Thank you. Did you guys used to go out? - Oh yeah we did, but it was ages ago. - Yeah, hmm. - We're just friends now. So what do you do? I'm in college, I go to Columbia. - Good. I want to be a singer. - Nice. - Nice, yeah. - Yeah. - But I guess as far as a job, I'm babysitting. - Oh, that's great, like a nanny. - Hey! - Hi! - Hey. - Hello. - What's up? - Good, hi, how are you? - I'm sorry. - I'm good, one sec! - I'm gonna take off. - What? - Dave is playing downtown. - So? - I should really go and see his show. - What, the guy with the teeth? - This could be a job. That's what I'm in New York to do. You don't need me here. - All right, well, I'll go with you. - No, no, no, you stay here with your friends, and do your reading. - No, I'll go with you. - No, no, no, no, you stay here.

You'll see. Do you know what it is? I always believed in being of use. I would ask myself, "How can I be of the most use?" Because William, it is in that way that God speaks to us. But Sarah, she doesn't think about that. She wants to be special. - Mom, I don't want to be special. I like to sing.

I have many faults, the worst of which is not how painfully I miss my daughter. But I'll be able to stand before God, and I'm a little worried about you. (Sarah speaks in foreign language) What about you, William? Will you be able to stand before God? - Well, Mrs. Garcia, to tell you the truth, it's my opinion that I have stood before God since the moment I met your daughter. - Oh my. Sarah, we have a bullshit artist sit at the table. Honey, I just don't what you to get hurt again. (Sarah speaks in foreign language) Well, he looks like David. - Shh. (speaks in foreign language) - [Mrs. Garcia] Smells like David. (Sarah speaks in foreign language) You know, he smells like something I don't like. - I'm done.

David and I went out for the two and a half years that I was at college. We lived together. After a while he said he couldn't fall asleep in the same bed with me. I don't know why, so... I started sleeping on the couch. It's so embarrassing. One night, I heard this noise. So, I walk into our room. And he had snuck another girl up the fire escape, and was having sex with her in my bed. The worst part about it is that I was so, I don't know, like crazy about him that I didn't break up with him, or, I wouldn't let him break up with me. And then, I dropped out of college to try to end it, and... That's why my mom is so mad. But the point is... I'm not so tough or interesting as you seem to think I am. I'm just more of a dork. - Hey. You should come to Mexico with me. - I'm afraid of that. - They've given me a first class ticket. I bet I could trade it in for two coach ones. - [Sarah] I'm afraid to fly. - You're bullshitting me. Come on, you should come. - You have to work. I don't want to talk anymore. I want to fool around. - Good. - Do you have a condom? - No. - Then we can't do it. - Oh God. - Do you want to get me pregnant? - [William] Yes. - Don't say that. - [William] Okay. (light instrumental music) (Sarah sighs) - Don't you find it odd when you're a kid? Everyone in the whole world tells you to follow your dreams. And when you get older, they act all offended if you even try. (light instrumental music) (women shouting in foreign language) I'll go to Mexico with you if you still want me to. But we need to leave a week early, and then I'll come back home before you start work okay? - Okay. - Good night. - Good night. - [William Voiceover] Mexico... Is where it all went down.

(Sarah laughs) - [Sarah] You're not being gentle. - How was I being? - [Sarah] Rough. - Are you kidding? - [Sarah] No. I don't like it when you're like that. - Like what? - [Sarah] Cynical and sarcastic. - I am sincere. - [Sarah] I would believe that you believe you are for a while. - Everything's for a while. For a while is the stuff that dreams are made of, baby. - [Both] I am sincere. (both laughing and kissing) - [William Voiceover] We weren't good tourists. In our room, the scent of sex was thick. I never wanted to take a shower again. My hands, my arms, my face, all smelled of Sarah. We would mess around all day till it hurt. It was hard to tell if she was kissing me or touching me. Every part of her body was as wet as her mouth. Sarah wasn't sexy the way other people are sexy. Her body wasn't tight or taut or anything like that. She was funny, the way watching people fall asleep on buses with their heads continually dropping and then jerking back up, is funny. She was human, the most human person I had ever met, and that was sexy. - [Sarah] Are you awake? - [William] Uh huh. - [Sarah] I remember one afternoon, I came home from school and my mom told me my father had left us. I didn't believe her. I thought it was a game, like hide and seek. So I looked all over the house. Closets, under beds, I looked everywhere. - Where'd he go? - He went to a rehabilitation center in Albany, and never came back. But he wrote me once a month, from the day he left 'til I went away to college. Once I was away from home, he'd come visit me. He just never wanted to see my mother again. His letters were my favorite part growing up. Always came in these dark blue envelopes, and I'd keep them in a box under my bed. I loved that they were blue, because when he lived with us, he'd come home always wearing his blue work shirt. And I'd sit on the back of the couch, and I'll scratch his back. I'll scratch for as long as my mom would let me. When I went to bed at night, my fingers would be stained blue. - [William] And you liked that? - Yeah, I did. Do you ever miss your father? - No, never. (light instrumental music) - You see me? Would you like me to scratch your back? (laughs) - Stand up and go to the bathroom. - Why? - Just do it. (romantic music) - [William Voiceover] I wanted to tell her I loved her. I loved everything about her. (groaning) - Oh, God. I loved the way she made me feel, even when that was miserable. I loved the way she bought a dress, the way she made love in bathrooms, the way she ate chocolate. I loved her mother, her drunk blue letter writing father. I loved every thought she ever had. - [Sarah] Papi. Are you okay? - [William] I just needed to get some fresh air. - Well, go get us some beer, maybe some OJ for the morning. - [William] Yeah, good. - [Sarah] What is it? - I don't know, I got this weird flash of nervousness all of a sudden. - I love you. - I love you, too. (groaning and kissing) - Go get us some beer, okay? - Okay, I'm on it. - Don't forget the OJ! - No problema. - Bye. - [William Voiceover] I ran through the city. I wasn't looking for a place to buy beer. I just ran. (upbeat music) (people speaking foreign language) (people screaming and laughing) (coughing) - No! - Yes! - You don't understand. - I thought you're not supposed to drink the water down here. - But it's in a bottle. - But it's-- - No, it's in a bottle. - Alright. - (laughs) Tourista. (laughs) (upbeat music) (women speaking in foreign language) - What? - Well... Carmen Maria said it's possible to get married, if you really want to do that. - Today? - If you don't want to do it, it's not a big deal. - No, I didn't say I didn't want to do it. I just said, "Today?" - Look, I don't know. I'm just not sure if I can be away from you. And how many times in a person's life are you gonna fall in love? I mean... (sighs) I'd love to marry you. I figure, as long as we maintain a sense of ourselves as individuals, and not become some sloppy, clingy couple whose lives revolve around each other, then, it might be better if we did get married. Then, if something goes wrong, or goes weird, which, you know, it most likely will, we'd have to figure it out, and one of us couldn't just run away. - [William] Do you want to have a kid? - [Sarah] Yeah, but not right away. - [William] No, not right away, of course not. - [Sarah] No. So, what do you think, am I crazy? - [William] Let's do it. - [Sarah] Really? - I want to do it. - I mean, you have to be sure. If we do this, we'll be mentioned in each other's obituaries, no matter what. - Let's get married. Let's be individuals, let's have kids. - Yeah, not right away. - Not right away. But, fuck it, man. (Sarah laughs) Let's do it. - Yeah. - Yeah. (kissing and laughing) - I don't understand why you say that. Well because it's my life. Yes. Mom. I know it's fast but it's what we want, Mom. William. William, come here. Do you mind talking to her? Just talk to her. - Hello, Mrs. Garcia. - [Mrs. Garcia] So you what to marry my daughter. - That's right ma'am, I do. - [Mrs. Garcia] Stop calling me ma'am. You sound insincere. - Fair enough. - [Mrs. Garcia] Is she pregnant? - No, she's not pregnant. - [Mrs. Garcia] I didn't have Sarah till I was 30. That myth about a young mother having pretty babies isn't true. - Yep, I understand. - [Mrs. Garcia] Now listen to me very carefully. - Okay. - [Mrs. Garcia] You are a complete idiot. You are both exceedingly lacking in intelligence. Am I being clear? - Yes, I think you are. - [Mrs. Garcia] Since it doesn't look like I can do anything to change your mind, I only can hope you prove me wrong. - I hope so, too. - [Mrs. Garcia] Now give me back to Sarah. - Okay. Bye, Mrs. Garcia. - Hi Mom. - [Mrs. Garcia] Sarah... - Okay. Yes, I understand. Okay. I love you too, Mom. Bye. - Hey, what'd she say? - I can't get married. - What'd she say? - She said that it was a good idea. That you'll be good for me. That I'll never make it on my own. She was actually very surprised because she didn't think that you liked me that much. Huh. I'm sorry, William, I was just being ridiculous. (church bells ring) - Come here. - No, I can't go anywhere. - Come here. - I'm not gonna get married. - I know. - Okay. - Two seconds. Just follow me, come on. - [Sarah] Where are we going? Where are we going? - You'll see. (church bells ring) Come on! - What? - Come on! - I'm going. (church bells ring) (laughter) (children speaking in foreign language) (light instrumental music) (footsteps) Promise me, if something goes wrong, if I run away, you'll find me and make me kiss you. - Nothing will go wrong. - Just promise. - I promise.

How is it? - [Sarah] It's pretty good. - I got you these. - Thank you. - [William] I brought you that towel you wanted. - Thanks. - And here's a present. It's a green dress. I saw it on a mannequin, and it reminded me of that one you wear, so I bought it. I don't know if that's lame or not, buying something for somebody that you know they already have, but - it made sense at the time. - [Sarah] Thank you. - No problem. Do you want to put these flowers in some water or something? - Sure. - Are you nervous? - Yes. - [William] About seeing me? - You look different. You told me you weren't coming home 'til tonight. - [William] I took a different flight. - Why? - Hey, I heard a joke, you want to hear it? - Sure. - Okay, there's these two monks. A monsignor guy, and a regular monk guy, and they're fishing. And the regular monk catches this humongous fish. He goes, "Wow, that is one heck of a son of a bitch", and the monsignor guy says, "My son, watch your language". And the other one says, "No, Father, I'm sorry, "but that's the name of the fish, son of a bitch." "Oh", goes the monsignor. So that night they're initiating some new monk, and they decided to serve the fish. They all sat down eating this fish and the regular monk goes, "Boy, this son of a bitch is really good". And the monsignor guy says, "Yeah, I've never had son of a bitch this good". And he turns to the new recruit and says, "How do you like the fish?" And the new guy says, "Hey, I'm not much for fish, "but I'm sure gonna enjoy working with you fuckin' guys". - I have to go to the bathroom. - How're you doing? - I just woke up.

And I got some things I could probably take are of. - Okay! I think you're right. - What do you mean? - Well, you just said you have some things to take care of, right? - Yeah, but you know that's a fuckin' lie. All I do is go to the movies. I've been to 13 movies in three days. I mean, you don't want me to come, right? - Ah. I don't know, I mean... (sighs) I don't know. It's just, you don't seem to do anything except sit around and wait for me. You know that's not the couple we wanted to be. - I do? - Look, while you were gone, I mean, I don't want to belittle the time we spent in Mexico, but it wasn't very realistic. And all I did while you were away was sit around a wait for you and think about you. And, I can't do that. I've done that before, and I know that sounds, ugh. Sometimes, you take that away. - I take that away? Take what away? - I came to New York to be on my own. I'm just happy that I was able to feel the way you made me feel.

(sighs) - Are you breaking up with me? - I just think we need a little more space. - Space? Can't you think of something a little more original than that? - I'm just trying to be honest. - Well, then, you're a pretty boring person if like, catchphrases from breakup 101 are your idea of the truth. - I like you so much. - Oh great, you like me. So I don't have to feel bad then. That's super. I'm a sweet guy. A fun fellow to have Margaritas and hang with for a week or so but, not somebody to see like on a day to day basis. Why are you doing this? - William. You're gonna be fine. - Oh fuck you! You're a spoiled, selfish, cold coward. I've told people to fuck off, and I know how important you feel.

It's my "I'm sorry" outfit. - Look, I have to go to work. - I know, can I walk with you? Are you Native American? - [Sarah] What? - Nothing. Okay, so here's the deal. I'm going to do the talking, alright? Because I have some things to say, and because you don't look particularly talkative. Not that you don't look good, because you do, that's why I asked the thing about being Native American. Anyway, I'll start the talking, and if you want to jump in, just say, "Hey, I got something to say". And five'll get you 10 then I'll say, "Go right ahead". Okay, I know what you're thinking, "God, this guy is such a creep. "Two days ago, he says all kinds of nasty things, "and leaves my apartment in a huff, and now, "he wakes me up in a tuxedo, howling at my window, "and expects me to think it's funny." Well, let me tell you, missy, you are absolutely right. I don't even like myself. So what, the suit gets no comment? "Why are you wearing that?" "Oh, you're so zany." Or maybe, "I can't believe you're such a cuckoo-head." Nothing, huh? You're just gonna keep walking. Okay, that's cool. You want to know why I wore it? An attempt to make movies more realistic. I like to embrace the cliche. Hey, this is A material. Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I fucked up. I got upset. You just switched gears on me, you know. You got to admit that. Look, I know you're getting a little scared that maybe we went too far, too fast, and that's cool. It's just you got to give me a minute to get the idea, you know? I don't know how to love you right.

Everything was disintegrating so quickly. I knew I was the dopey guy standing out in the cold, staring up at a warm window. Hell, I wished it would rain. It's just so hard to miss someone who only lives eight blocks away. - [Jesse] At a certain point William, your father not calling you on your birthday becomes your problem, not his. - I didn't expect him to call. - [Jesse] He loves you very much, I'm sure of this. - Why are we talking about him? - [Jesse] I just think it's too painful for him to remain in contact with you. - Why are you giving this to me? Who brought him up? - I'm sorry. - [William] Why do you think she doesn't like me? - Who? What, that girl? Because there's something wrong with her. - No, Mom. There's something wrong with me. What do you think it is? - You respect people more when they don't respect you. That, and you didn't go to college. Those are your only two flaws. Do you want to hear about my new boyfriend? I suppose that doesn't interest you. He's very funny. His name is Harris. I think you'll be astonished at how many times you fall in love. - I just... I just don't seem to have the first idea about how men are supposed to behave. It seems like I don't have certain qualities that I should, you know? I mean, I'm sure most men don't sit around getting all chatty with their moms. You know what I'm saying? What are other men like? Are they like me? - I don't know. - Hey, how come I'm not baptized? Weren't you the least bit concerned with the state of my soul? - Oh... Listen, William, there was nothing anybody at the Fort Worth First Methodist could do for the state of your soul. - [William] Oh, forget it, it's not important. - Look, listen to me. You've been ignoring me since you were 15, and I was thinking that a good birthday resolution might be to change your attitude about your poor old Ma. Don't be so moody. A lot of bad shit is gonna happen to you. People are not gonna love you back. And if you're serious about becoming an artist, that's the first thing you should learn. And listen, you're gonna die, okay? Relatively soon, okay? So, that being said, you have nothing to worry about. No matter what happens in this life, you have two options, only two options. You can handle things well and be happy, or you can handle them poorly and be miserable. It's up to you. Look William, I'm disappointed. I didn't escape Fort Worth to sell college textbooks in Trenton, New Jersey, that was not my goal. I thought my life was gonna be so much more interesting than it's turned out, but what am I gonna do about it, huh? The root of depression is being too self-involved, and the cure is to read. Okay? So, read some books. Don't take yourself so seriously. Exercise, take that gorgeous, sexy body outside and move it. Here, and open your present. You gotta lose those cowboy boots, William.

We're apart for four stupid weeks, and I come back to this? - Listen, if you really care about me, you need-- - What did I do? I didn't do anything wrong. - If you really care about me, you need to take the time to understand me. - Oh, this is my fault? - [Sarah] It's no one's fault. - Oh, well, that's debatable. - Look, I told you, this was gonna be really difficult. - Would you shut up with the corny fuckin' lines? You don't like me anymore. I was amusing for a minute, and now I should go away, and hang your fucking picture on the wall! I mean, what am I supposed to do here, huh? You know, I've done what you're doing. I've said the shit that you're saying, and I know it's a lie. - It's not a lie. - It's a fucking lie. - Well, maybe you lie to people, but I am trying to be honest. - [William] Ugh, would you please stop saying that? - Say what? - [William] Honest! - Look, you don't love me. I could be any girl. I care about you and you made me very happy, but I can't hear myself think when you're in the room. Everything is a big game of pretend with you. Let's pretend to get married, let's pretend I'm gonna be a country star, just pretend you're someone else, remember? - No, I-- - No! Nothing is casual with you. Everything is a fuckin' big deal. - No! No, no, no, no, no! Only you. Only you're a big deal. - Stop it! - Okay, I'm handling this pretty badly, aren't I? Listen, I'm a great guy, you love me. Look at me. Would you please look at me? I'm right here, look at me. It's my birthday. - What, what? - Okay, I'll go. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I want to make this easy on you. I don't want to be pathetic, I really don't. But do you think you could lie to me a little? Or, have me sleep here next to you, something just to make this a little bit easier? - I cannot do that. - Yes, you can. God! I feel like you're playing some sick practical joke on me. - I'm sorry you feel like that. - Would you please talk to me like a person? - Look, what you're going through has happened to me before, and once I got through it, I was grateful because I was so much stronger. - Strong? I am fucking strong. Where did you go? - What a fucking bitch. She didn't seem like your type anyway. - [William] You think anybody who isn't like you isn't my type. - That's not true. She just seemed a little crunchy. I heard she wouldn't fuck you. - [William] That's not true, we had sex. - Yeah, I didn't believe it when I heard it. I mean, I couldn't imagine, you not fucking anybody. - [William] She wouldn't sleep with me for a while. - Why not? She have some kinda hang-up? I think I was there, but it was hard because, I mean I was walking and talking, 'cause, okay, so here's what happened. It was on pre-school, and we went to this park where I grew up, and I was wearing this very special vest that my grandmother had just made for me. It had like a little purple unicorn on the pocket.

I just know that you're not gonna call me back, and you should. I mean, I'd like you to, that'd be nice. Not that you give a rat's ass about being nice, because I know you don't. It's just that I went out with this other girl a couple of nights ago. Samantha, remember her? I mean, I know you don't like her because she doesn't spout out a lot of intellectual bullshit, but she's real smart. You shouldn't think that just because a girl's pretty, she's not smart, because that's not the case. I don't know, it always seemed to me like you had a lot of hang-ups about shit like that. Maybe it's just that you try to be, like, all extra smart because you're not that pretty. But you shouldn't do that because you know, I think you're pretty. Not that you're, like, fantastically interested in receiving emotional advice from me or anything, but Samantha is definitely an attractive woman, and she's smart. And, we had a good time. It gave me some distance on us, you know? It made me miss you less. Not like I'm some crazy maniac missing you or something, so don't get all freaked out and call the cops. Just call me back, okay? That'd be cool, you know? I mean, I'm aware I'm not first on your list of people to please right now, but... (sighs) Just give me a call. I really need to talk to somebody. You know what I was thinking the other day? Remember how you used to walk on the curb, and have me walk on the street, so that we could be the same height? Yeah, well, that's really fucked up. You shouldn't do that. I'm taller than you, and you should just face it. Yeah, well... Listen, I don't want to hang up right now, because I know as soon as I do, I'm gonna feel like a real moron. So could you just please call me back? Otherwise I'll probably kill myself. I'm not going to kill myself. You know, you really have no sense of humor whatsoever. That always drove me crazy about you. All right. Call me back, okay? I'm gonna hang up now. Bye. (phone beeps off) (dial tone) (phone dials numbers) (phone rings on line) - [Sarah] William, you have to stop calling. - Hey. I thought you were probably at your mom's for Christmas or something. - [Sarah] Christmas is still a week away. - Yeah, yep, hmm, I remember. I just wanted to call you back, and tell you I was sorry for calling. - [Sarah] You sound exhausted. Why don't you get some rest? - Because I can't sleep. You know, I've been thinking about you a lot recently, more like non-stop. - [Sarah] I appreciate you thinking about me, but we shouldn't talk now, not for a long time. - Yeah, I think you're right. Or else, maybe I just want to agree on something. - [Sarah] Let's agree on that, okay? Goodbye. (dial tone) (William grunts) - [Samantha] All this time, I thought that secretly, you were a good person. But you're not. - [Priest] And enjoy the spirit of generosity. The Peace of the Lord be with you. - And also be with you. - [Priest] I'd like to invite you to open your hearts and shake hands with the people around you. - Merry Christmas. What is it with you? - Oh let's see, I can't sleep. I go to the bathroom about 15 times an hour. I wake up to a voice inside my head that calls myself a faggot with every throbbing of my pulse. I haven't seen my father since I was eight. And I'm 21 years old now, and I feel like I should have my shit together, but all I feel is everything coming apart. And for about three minutes I believed in destiny and that, you know, I had one. But now, I'm... I don't know, adrift. I got no connection to anything. Not people, not me, not you, not family, not the past, not the future, not anything.

I mean, I know it's a pain in the ass for us to drive around like this, but your father... Your Daddy is what people like to call "a project". He wants to make me very small, and fit me in his pocket. You're sweet. Merry Christmas, William. Isn't this fun? Do you think you're gonna get a lot of good presents? I think so. You know what I want? I want your daddy to stop being such a bully. You don't bully women, William, it's not nice. You want to be a cowboy, you can be a cowboy, but you be a gentleman cowboy. Look, you just be whatever you want. God damn it. God damn it. - Hey, no. Hey, hey! No, no, hey! - You stay in the car. You hear me, you stay in this car. Now, I told you not to be here! I told you not-- - Don't talk to me! Hey, hey fuck you! - Leave him alone. Hey buddy. Merry Christmas, okay? This is from Santa. - All right. Just, hey! - That's it, okay, goodbye. Merry Christmas. - Yeah, Merry Christmas to you too. ♪ Don't it make you want to stay ♪ - Sicko. Buddy, what's going on? - I love that stupid girl so much, Mom. - I fell in love with your father because of the way he told a joke. - That doesn't always work. - My point is, it's all pretty arbitrary. Your whole life, people are going to ask you to be weak, William, they'll practically beg you. But all anybody really wants from you is for you to be strong. Look. It's a baptism, by ice.

Thank you. - [William] So listen. - Could I bum one of those? - [William] Yeah. Remember that time we were shooting those cans? - No. - Behind the supermarket? - Mm, okay. - Yeah well, you said that day that, when I was 13, I could come live with you. You said that a bunch of times. - Yeah. - Yeah well, my 13th birthday's come and gone, and you never even called me. In point and fact, I haven't heard from you at all in a pretty long time. - I'm sorry. - Well, apology not accepted, you know what I mean? - (laughs) Yeah, I know what you mean. Look William... It was so hard on you when you were little when we would... You know, and your mother, she... Well, you know, and then, I got remarried and... (laughs) Every family-- - [William] Can we talk about something else? - Yeah. - I fell in love with this girl, but she broke up with me. - [Vince] Yeah? - She kind of broke my heart, I think. - [Vince] That'll happen. - That happen to you? - [Vince] Sure, sure, I guess. - Did my mom break your heart? - [Vince] I don't know. I don't know, that was a long time ago. - Well, you got over it, huh? - Yes. - Well, good for you. I just feel like I might not get over it, you know? Like maybe I'm too sensitive or something. - Well, maybe you won't. You know what I mean? You'll move on, but, if it hurt real bad, then it'll scar, or, like a bone fracture, or something. You know, it'll ache when it rains. - Sounds like some real deep advice, coming from a guy who bailed on his son. - I'm just doing my best here. - Well it's not very good, your best. - No, no, it's not. - I was in a movie. I bet you didn't know that. - No, a movie? - Yeah, I'm gonna be a big fat fuckin' movie star. And people are gonna ask you if you're related to me, and you're gonna have to say, "Yep, he's my son that I never see". - Well, that would be great. - Why are you being so... I don't know. - [Vince] How do you want me to be? - I don't know. I wanted you to call me, that's all. - I'm sorry. You know, I thought... I thought it would be better for you. - God damn, it is bitch cold. I thought it was supposed to be hot in Texas. - [Vince] Yeah, it's the Hottest State. - What? - Fort Worth is the Hottest State I know. My dad lives there, my grandma too, most every grandparent except a few. I like it there. Boy, is it hot. - [William] What's that? - It's a poem you wrote when you were a kid. - Oh yeah? Does that make you feel better that you remember some poem? - No, it doesn't. - I loved you so much, and then... Hey, what have I got to do to get this girl back? - [Vince] You can't will anybody to do anything. - What do I have to do? - What was her name? - [William] Sarah. - Did she ever love you? - I don't know. I think so. - Don't do anything. Just be cool, you know? Just wait, she'll call you. - [William] She won't. - Yes, she will. - [William] No, she won't. - Well then, fuck her, you know? People who give up on love aren't worth loving. - What's that say about you? - I don't know what it says about me. But, seeing you here today says a hell of a lot about you. (light instrumental music) - [Dave] Do you what to do it the same key? - [Sarah] Sure. - [Dave] Okay. - Hi. - Hi. - Um, do you want to sit down? - Sure. - [Sarah] We've been away for a little while, doing some tour of some Canadian universities. And I don't know, I thought it might be a good idea if we said, "Hello". - It might be. - [Sarah] How are you? - You know... Fine. Good. How about you? - Like a cat, always nervous. - [William] Don't worry. I'm not gonna break anything. - No, about performing. My mom is coming tonight, and she's so ridiculous. - Sounds like a big night. - Yeah. I just want to tell you that the week I spent with you in Mexico was probably the best six days of my whole life, and... I'm sorry it all didn't go down the perfect way. But when I think about the time we spent together now, I am grateful, for what it did for me. I don't know, I... I just think that you're too intense. (William laughs) You are, I mean, you're very intense. - You think I'm intense? - [Sarah] Yeah. - Really? I thought... I don't know what I thought, but something bad. Intense sounds good. I'm glad it was you. If somebody's gonna break your heart, you want it to be, you know, somebody like you. - You've always had a very deluded sense of how interesting I am. - Yeah, well, I like you. - And I didn't break your heart. Your heart was broken long before you ever met me. - Oh, give yourself a little credit. - [Dave] Check, check. - Whatever. How's the movie business? - [William] It's good. I'm... Starting a new one this summer. - Oh wow, cool. - [Dave] Hey Sarah, you want to try one? - Sure. Are you gonna stick around for the show? - Yeah sure, I'll be around. - Okay. - My heart is gold.

I wanted to believe it myself. Not because I wished my parents dead or anything. But more because orphans were tough. They could handle anything. And because I wanted to be free from this emotional chain reaction that seemed to be sparking off like a string of firecrackers since the day I was born. I felt that again, only now I didn't have to pretend. It was real. I was 21, an adult, and an orphan at last. ♪ So don't you look back ♪ ♪ Don't you look back ♪ ♪ Don't you look back ♪ ♪ Don't you look back ♪ ♪ No more ♪ (light instrumental music) (mellow music) ♪ If you don't want to talk now ♪ ♪ I won't make a fuss ♪ ♪ And everything that we said ♪ ♪ It will stay with us ♪ ♪ And if you don't wanna see me ♪ ♪ You won't lose my trust ♪ ♪ And everything that we did ♪ ♪ It will stay ♪ ♪ It will stay ♪ ♪ It will stay with us ♪ ♪ There was a time to tell you ♪ ♪ Till we turn to dust ♪ ♪ Everything that we felt ♪ ♪ It will stay ♪ ♪ It will stay ♪ ♪ It will stay ♪ ♪ It will stay ♪ ♪ It will stay with us ♪ ♪ Till we're down the road ♪ ♪ I'll see you again ♪ ♪ I don't know when ♪ ♪ And I know you'll be the same ♪ ♪ And I know I'll be the same ♪ ♪ Unchanged ♪ ♪ You'll free me again ♪ ♪ But I'll never be free ♪ ♪ Of memories ♪ ♪ And I know your life will change ♪ ♪ And I know my life will change ♪ ♪ Unchained ♪ ♪ Unchained unchained ♪ ♪ You'll drift away ♪ ♪ Like roses on the sea ♪ ♪ Stars up in the sky ♪ ♪ Well they're always alone ♪ ♪ They're on their own ♪ ♪ And I know that they'll always shine ♪ ♪ And I know that they'll always shine ♪ ♪ On time ♪ (mellow instrumental music)
