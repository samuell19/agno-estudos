It can wait. I think not. Man, I've known you for 20 years. That shit doesn't scare me. True. For 20 years, I've known you to be a little bitch. How's that fact gonna work for you when I let you stew in the county all weekend for not cooperating? You gonna miss your big weekend. Aye, why don't you guys step out, give us a second, give us a minute. Good call. Hey girl, I see you. Answer me one question and I'll be out of your hair. Hurry. You come back home to the spin, there's a trill of bodies lined up from the airport to the club. Why is that? Now I know you've lost it 'cause. I don't have a clue what you're talking about. The dead kids Rush. Don't act brand new with me, bro! Z, this is Chicago! There's a murder every commercial break. How's that my fault? I'm not saying that it is. You can't be as ignorant as you look. I know you seen something, heard something. I know this is bad for business, may even hurt the brand for you to acknowledge it, hell, you might even be involved! Keep dreaming. Unlike you, I made it. I didn't have to quit and get a nine to five to pay my bills. Really? Yeah, really. I'm on top of the mountain. I wouldn't jeopardize that for shit. Somebody doesn't share your point-of-view, bro. All I'm trying to say is, they either hiding behind you, or they trying to knock you off, bro. You feel me? Time's up toy cop. I gotta work. If you have plans to leave after the fest, don't. What, you gonna get a warrant to stop me? You should only be so lucky. Stop, he did not. You have to tell him. Hey, from last night, right, the fest? Yeah. You know Rush? Come on. That's my dude. You guys going tonight? We want to. We couldn't get tickets. I might be the key to your salvation. Sweet. You got tickets? I'm like a VIP ticket. Dude, don't fuck with us. We really wanna go to Mollywood. Seriously, we'd do anything to go. Anything? We'll see. Sweet. Why don't you swing by our place for a pre-game? Give me your phone. I'll put my number in. Think we can meet Rush? I don't see why not. Anything's possible in life, right? Yes it is. We did say anything. That's the problem with the culture today. They're all living for pleasure. You back, huh? Yeah until this is paying me again. I though you needed the time off. What'd he tell you to get you back? My brother. I knew it. Let me show you this picture real quick. Girl from Mollywood, Logan Square last year. Yeah? Definitely the same guy. What makes you say that? Look at the gashes around her upper torso. See? It's like he has to build rage in order to finish the job. Like a trigger. Exactly. Can you put this on me, please? Yeah. Listen, I don't want you to make this a personal thing, do you understand me? Do you get it? I don't wanna lose you again. I didn't knew you cared. I do. It's just been hard to get through your fucking fan club. Don't talk like that. Whoa, that's perfect. Now I got me some blackmail material. Go to hell Mertelli. What if they wand her at the door? Don't worry, I got it. Easy money, what's up? All good. Good to see you, man. Listen, I got that next generation right now on deck. Keep your people on point, let them know. Next week, hit me up. You gonna see. That's what I'm gonna tell my peeps too. Good pimpin'. That's what's up. Hey you. Hi. Where's your friend I saw you with last time? Work, but we're still having the after party. You still coming by, right? If you're lucky. Who's your friend over there? That's my girl. Don't forget to bring gifts. I always do. We're set. Are you sure you have to go? Yeah. I have to work tomorrow. Okay, but you'll be back tomorrow night, right? I'll see. It all depends on work. It's gonna be so much fun. I hope to get there, but at the end of the day, we had a good time tonight. I hope you did. By the way, I want you to be safe tonight, okay? You too. Hey, be safe. I will. Chill. Good evening. Chase from the coffee shop. It's amazing how the universe works, right? The law of attraction is always right there in your hand. Anything's possible in life, right? Putting a late on in, aye? Yeah man, releasing anxiety. This club shit is messing with my head. That's what I heard. You be easy. I'm out. Lock up behind you. Will do. Hey Cody. Thank you. Yeah. They say the youth is wasted on the young! My solution to it is... I have been commissioned to do your worth. To clean the devil's plate. Your bro isn't here! Say I surrender my spirit and body to the Lord now. Say it! Say it! Please! Say I turn my will, spirit, and body to the Lord! No, please! Please! Una pregunta? Bijou sent you? Bijou sent you motherfucker? Yeah, he sent me nigga! Who needs eyes without vision? For a blessing and vessel and backhand! God's plan. May you understand I am the gift, I am your salvation! You will be freed for the Lord says, the good word says those who have set off flesh of death and violent towards the Lord, with those who are set on spirit are free from peace. Amen. Lord, they know not what they do. Did you say Molly? Tell me about Brianna. Tell me about Brianna. Here's the part I can't understand. Help me! Why so sloppy with the red hand? It's like you lost control. Bless it on the! You understand? Understand? You get it? Nothing is free! Deduction's not free! How bad? I've never, ever seen it that bad. I'm at a lost for words. I'm not. This motherfucker's mine! Serge, you did check on the victim at the hospital, right? What victims? The girl that the neighbor found on the street. They said she might be a roommate in here. I told you! I told you! I am the instrument, the salvation, the life, the death, the future, the present. I am nothing except for alone in the hands of your blood. Look what I have brought you! I live to open the doors of the hearts, to destroy Satan's prison. Please God, I sacrifice my life in your name! I live to be a catalyst of change, even to my own self-destruction. God, hear me! Listen now! Feel me! Let me breathe Lord, I ask you! I'm so sorry. We're on it. Yes. Okay. Thanks. Damn! Who was that? The girl's mother. Any info? A little. The other victim was a roommate, Brianna Tionni, been friends since grade school. And the guy? She didn't know him, but did say she was concerned with how much they had been throwing themselves into the club kids scene, especially obsessed with your boy. Rush. Rush. I don't know. I don't know what's next, but we gotta hurry up and figure something out. Is it time to take the gloves off now, huh? By the book even now? Easy! Let me go! Easy! Let me go! I was just with her! She's just a girl! - Yes. - I know. How's Angie? Fuck! You need that? Aye Serge, I'm out! Zack, wait! Where to? You don't wanna know. Give me five. You know where this comes from? Let me show you. From her. See that bloody mess? That's where your eyeball's supposed to be. Somebody burned her eyeball while she was still alive. Can you imagine that type of pain? Can the almighty Rush the DJ, be bothered to talk to me now? I don't know what you want from me. I don't know anything. Bullshit Rush! These are kids, man. Fuck that man, these are you fucking fans! This means she was here to see you. You think I don't care? You know how much this is fucking with me? I make music to make people happy, not for kids to get hurt. You ever think carrying crates would take you all over the world? Not really. Could've been the same for you. You're almost as good as your brother. What you mean almost? Step aside, man. Come on. The new stuff right here. I couldn't do this fake, soulless, techno bullshit, man. You just gotta give it a chance. Hell no. Old school house 'til I die, man, you know what I mean? Yo Z, I know it's been awhile but, I really want you to know how sorry I am about Tony. He was special, man. Everybody loved him. Man, could he rock a party. He could, huh? I still got the old A to Z mix tape y'all made. You serious? Yo, does this mean I could count on you? Whatever man. I just need this shit to end. Good. It's real good 'cause all in the kid that the killer's still in the know, maybe even inside your inner circle. What? Yo, I gotta rush out. I'll catch you later. What's wrong with you? Ran into your guy Chase. And? And? Dude is strange as hell. I'm telling you, every time he comes around, shit gets weird. April, he's like my brother. Chase moved in with my family when we were 15, right after his parents got killed by a drunk driver, an accident that caused him to have almost everything below his waist reattached. I didn't know that. It was his inheritance that paid for my DJ equipment, pay for the parties we first threw, pay for the flights, the planes, the hotels. If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't even be here. Still Rush, something is not right, okay? I went up to him and asked him if he knew that one girl and he got in my face and told me to get the hell away from him. What? I'm telling you. I truthfully believe he's got something to do with this. That doesn't sound like him at all. He's the most religious dude I know. He's all fanatical about it. Suit yourself. I warned you, more than once. To redeem is spared. Send it back to the great maker. Rosen? Yeah, I'm Rosen. Sergeant wants you upstairs immediately for a transport. I got you covered for the rest of the night. Damn man. I get out in an hour. I'm sure I'll release you as soon as they get in the county. Better put a step on it. He's waiting. Later. Later. God's been calling for them and I am here to make sure that call is delivered properly. I know you've been awaiting me. Good morning sunshine. Yes. Feel your mortality and realize you are eternal. God's been calling for you and I'm here to be the deliverer. They say when one door closes, another door opens. God has sent me to redeliver you. You feel it? It's all an illusion, you understand? Everything that you keep holding on to so desperately, the skin that you're stuck in, you've been stuck in for way too long. Take my hand. It's okay. That's the problem with society today. Most are so concerned with the flesh that they live in, they don't even see their spirit. So sad. If we only knew what we had in us because of God. My child, God is calling you. Your future is very bright. God has been waiting for you. Are you ready? I want you to close your eyes and ask the Lord to wait. Close your eyes and say hello to the new life which you have been awaiting. Hey! Wait! You ready for divine intervention? Shut the fuck up is what God said! Aye boss, they almost ready for you. Who? It's the bag. Go up. Where the fuck you get this from? Some fucked nigga on 79th, but he verified. Why the fuck it ain't pink? That's all he had right now, but that's his best. Why the fuck you already running me? What the fuck? Really? Boss, what's taking him so long? Go fucking check on him! Fucking rookies, man. Yo, fuck nigga, what you doing man? We gotta go! What the fuck? Get up bitch. Fuck you, man! Get up yo, come on. You five, fuck! You shot me in my arm, man! I did bitch, and I'm gonna shoot you again if you don't give me the fucking name. What name, man? The fucking sauce, B! Give me the fucking name! Lays, Trace, Gaze, I don't fucking know man! What the fuck, man? Bitch! Yo, Martelli. Check for an African north side dealer named Bijou. He plugged our killer. The killer's name is Chase. You good man? You were really quiet the whole ride. Just a lot on my head right now, man, you know? Stuff at the office, projects, just working, man. It's a lot right now. Glad you mentioned that. You ever seen this drug before? Maybe you can look it up for me. No. I haven't heard of it. I'll have to check it out, man. I just realized actually, I gotta go run a couple more errands man before I head back home. Hey Chase. What you got in that bag, bro? I wanna talk to you, man. Hey! Son of a bitch! Rush wanted me to check the fueling on the foggers! There's one here and there's another on the other side! I like this rock candy. This is much more important. Watch. Damn! Hey baby, try this. Yo, who kicked your ass? So nice of you to care to ask. Your boy, Chase. What about him? It was him, all of it. He killed them all. Everybody out. Now! Tommy, get the fuck out of here! Didn't I tell you? Didn't I tell you? It can't be. This is Zack. Tommy, get the fuck out! - Bye bye. - Chase. I put everything on this, man! I swear to you Rush! I find out you had anything to do with it, anything, you'll be lucky to end up in jail, you hear me? Dude, come on. You're up. Run my drive. Come on, come on. We don't have time for that. Where the fuck is Tommy? We look so good tonight! DJ Rush! Yes girl. He gave you an eye. Did you see it? Ladies. What's up? No, we're fine! See ya! Get out of here. Dude! You wanna go party? - Leave us alone. - Kick it loser! Fucking bitch! Get ready! Are you ready? I can feel it running through me. It's become a prophecy. My time to reveal the illusion. I can't stand how I live. And I'm gonna make them pay at all cost. Yo man, what's up? Dude, you hear me calling you? Shut the fuck up! You don't know who I am! Back up! I will not! Shut up! You just get back up out of space, okay? Rush doesn't need people like you. Get off of me! Fucking around, all right? I'm not stalking anybody! Back off of me, okay? Don't fucking touch me, all right? Don't you ever put your hands on me. I know you got something to do with her! Touch me again! And then what? You know what, back the hell up, okay? - Fuck you! - Back up! I'm not gonna fucking back up! Touch me one more time! And what? What's gonna happen? This is what you've been waiting for. Most humans are driven by fear. I could see it in your eyes. It's all I see. I redeemed them and sent them back to their grave. Let me go, let me go. Your generation loves to get high, huh? You wanna get high? Take this down! Take it all baby! You love it. Just let me go! I can't do that! You made it seem like I was just here for some fucking cheap thrill! You have no clue of what the message that I'm here to bring! I don't care. You'll never see the light of my father's kingdom! I don't care. Why'd you do this to Rush? Because he's housing these fucking idiots. They'll never be redeemable unless I shepherd them! They're just kids. I won't say anything. It's too late for that. Just let me go, please. Please! The fuck are you doing here? Chill out. It's cool. - It's cool. - Back up! You move and she's dead, understand? You do that, you won't live to see her body drop. Back away! I'm not playing! Back up! Neither am I. What you did to those little girls, think I'm gonna let you walk out of here? You're crazier than you pretend to be. You don't know who the fuck I am! You know nothing about me. I know who you are, Chase. Chase Ellinburg. That's you, right? Parents died in a tragic accident. Don't talk about my parents. Don't talk about my parents! Never talk about my parents! You're not gonna like the fact that I know that that same accident left you mangled from the waist down. Shut up! Shut up! That's why you killed those little girls. You can't be a man, can you? I am the great healer! Drop her or I'll fucking blow your head off! Chase, what the fuck? Chase! What are you doing? Chase, calm down. Everybody back the fuck up! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Zack, Zack, Zack. Back up. Chase, what happened? You can always come to me, man. We came up like brothers, me and you. Some fucked up Cain and Abel type shit, right? No, no, no. It's just got a little crazy. We can fix this. Shut up! Don't say that! We can't fix anything! Nobody can fix us anymore! You got no clue with the torture I've been through! Not personally, but I was with you, in the hospital. Every step, I was with you. Chase, look what you did for me. Look, you did this. I was just trying to save them, brother! I was trying to do something and make a difference in my life! This isn't you Chase. It's so much more worse than this, man! You don't even know! Not the kids. They're all a bunch of fucked up junkies getting high every day, living to get high! They don't care who they affect! I lost everything! You don't understand Rush! You got a family! I got nothing! The spirit sent me to send a message to the world, to wake up! Fuck that! You killed those kids to save them? What did those kids ever do to you? I redeemed them! I sent them back to the great creator, to renew them, to send them back as fresh souls! No, this is not how it works. You owe me! It's not about who they were! It's about what they represent! Chase, they're just kids. They don't deserve any of this. A bunch of wasted potential. Look at them! They ain't doing nothing with their lives! Bro, they did not kill your parents, and they did not hurt you in that crash! It was some stupid addict. - Junkie kids, drug addicts! - So what? Waste, useless, waste! So what? What does any of that have to do with you taking revenge out on everyone? Just give me the knife. Back up, Rush! Want me to hurt you or hurt her? I will do it. Somebody has to be the wake-up call. Somebody gotta pay the price. Whoa, whoa, whoa! All secure! Send in the medics! Lord, forgive me for all my shortcomings. 10 milligrams of phenylamine injected! Let me go! Inbound with multiple gunshot wounds to the chest! He's stabilizing! Circle. No. Calm down. Calm down, calm down. What about the circle? The illusion. His IV fell out. Do something. Give me some morphine. 16, two of them. Shit, this is all my fault. How you figure that? I should've known. I should've known he was out of control. Out of control, maybe. A murderer, a sociopath, I doubt you could've figured that out. Still. Look dude, your family took him in, man. You took him on this an amazing journey. You paid him well. Don't you think you did enough? All of that man, and he still hated himself. It's not your fault, Rush. He was sick. You know, you guys are a lot alike. How? You chase by the same demons, just different obsessions. Yours is saving citizens and his was saving souls. I don't quite follow. You both blame the scene for what y'all lost. You haven't been able to move on. You're just stuck. I hope not anymore. What you gonna do now? Whatever you doing man, don't stop the music, bro.
