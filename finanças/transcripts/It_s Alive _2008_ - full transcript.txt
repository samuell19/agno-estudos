What's happening? Don't start. It's so sad! Dude, I'll see you everyday in school and every weekend for study session? I know. But there'll be no more pizza Fridays, no more late night Ben and Jerry's, no more peeing while you shower. You can come over to Frank's house and pee while I shower. It's not the same, and you know it. You want this? Yeah, cool. Can you give me a hand and grab the Emily dickinsons? Yeah, sure. Thank you. Len, are you really sure about all this? You're so close to finishing the semester. It'd be such a waste if you don't come back. I'll finish my thesis before, you know, it gets crazy. I'll be fine. And what about Frank? Are you sure about that? I mean, I don't think he's gonna be able to handle it. I'm more than sure. He's gonna be great. It might even surprise you. Look, I get it. I know. It's weird, but-- it's what I want. You know I'm here for you, right? If you need anything at all, anything. I know. Oh, nice! Oh, go, come on. Don't let me stop you. If you guys wanna explore more of a physical expression on your relationship, then I can wait. You missed it. We just made sweet, sweet love. What? It was hot. Babe? Frank? Hey. Hey, Chris. Wanna help? Here you go. Let's do it. Babe? Oh. Babe! Oh, my God. There's my baby. And my baby. Hi. Hey. So, what do you think? It's incredible. Yeah. Hey, I had an idea. Right. And you have to tell me if it's cheesy or not. Okay. I wanna put a quote above the bed. Something poetic from dickens. I'm listening. "Every child born in this world is finer than the last." Good old Dick. Not great for the siblings, but whatever you want. Siblings? Oh! Let me have this one. Okay. I hope that Chris is okay with this. He'll be fine. He almost died with mom and dad. He only just needs a little time. It's been a tough year. You know, my parents, they would have loved you. I'm almost done here. All right. Can I use your shower? Of course you can. It's our shower now. I love you. I love you. Go on. Frank! Breathe. Just breathe. That's right. Breathe, baby. Okay, okay. Do you remember the first night we met? Yeah. Every second. You must've walked by my table like five times. I was at Lancaster hall. All the girls were hitting on you. You're the big shot architect. And then-- you need to wait out here. Can I be with her? No. No, not yet, Frank. Is there a problem? It appears the fetus has had a growth spurt since our last checkup. Is that unusual? In the last ultrasound, everything looked okay. But since then, the baby's doubled in size. We're six months in. No, I know, I know. I-I don't know what happened. But lenore's body is sending a definite message. That baby wants out. Unfortunately, it's not gonna be an easy one, Frank. We're prepping lenore for a c-section now. She's gonna be okay? She's gonna be fine. Don't worry. She'll be fine. Okay. How are you feeling, lenore? Mm, weak. Good. That's the medication I gave you to stop the contractions. Don't worry. You're supposed to feel relaxed. Leonore, the anesthesiologist is gonna prep you now, and then we'll count you down, okay? I'm gonna start you lv. You're gonna feel a little stick. Thank you. Starting to feel like you're floating? We're gonna count you down now, okay? In ten, nine, eight, seven. You're gonna be okay. There's something wrong with the baby. There's nothing wrong with the baby, leonore. Six, five, four, three, stop. Stop. Scalpel. We ready? Let's get that baby out. Here it comes. He's big. Yeah, he is big. Seems okay. Clamping. What the hell? Baby. Baby. Honey. Are you okay? Are you okay, baby? Oh, man, look at you. Is everything all right? We have to take her back into surgery, but the baby's fine. What happened? He'll be okay. We just have to clean him up. Did you see him? You okay? It's okay. Is she all right? Can I come? Stay here. Nobody saw anybody come in or out of that room, right? We're searching the video tapes. Everything seems normal. That's bad as far from normal as you can get. Come one. Come on, this way. And then l woke up here. That's it. Was there anyone unusual about? Anyone in that room that shouldn't have been there? Look, she was completely doped up, sergent. She can't help you. I just wanna take my baby home now. Fair enough. If you don't mind, in a few days I'm gonna ask you to speak to a psychologist who works for our department. Psychologist? Why? 'Cause he's real good at getting witnesses to remember events of a crime. We really appreciate it if you don't mind. Larkspur residents are in a state of shock today with the events at county hospital. Two doctors and two nurses were brutally murdered in the operating room while performing a cesarean section birth. Although police spokesman had little to say on the subject, kbls radio has learned that they're at a loss to find a motive. No suspect has been identified. Hey! Come meet your nephew, Buddy. Oh. He's huge. What's his name? Daniel. What do you think? Yeah, that works. Danny boy. You like him? He's something. Lenore harker. Early twenties. Comes form a military family. Both her parents are stationed overseas, but not her. In graduate school. Nineteenth century French poets. No record of any kind. Seems traumatized by it. Blocked it all. I told her you were gonna be talking to her. Well, the sooner the better. I'm gonna put up hope. Buy the garage and gonna go fishing at the Lake. We'll go dirt biking but don't tell your mom. Hi. Hey. We're making plans. It's your daddy! Baby's wrapped too tight. No, he's fine. No, it's too tight. All the books say that he should be a little looser. He's okay. Frank. You scratched me. Wow. We're gonna have to cut his nails. Oh, no, baby, he's scared. I'm sorry. Here you go. Go to your mommy. You're huge. He's probably just hungry. You're gonna check on Chris while I feed him? Yeah. Oh, that's a man. That's a hungry man. Yes, it is. That's a hungry man. Yes, it is. Len, have you been here all night? Frank, your son is totally amazing. Of course he is. He's a Davis. No, you don't understand. He rolled over. They're not supposed to do that for four months. And he lifted his head. He's so strong. He's special. He's a special baby. He's a little bruiser. Shit. Good boy. Sh. Baby, sh. Sh. Okay. I know you didn't mean it. Okay. Sh. Honey, we got us a little company in the bathroom. So, I need those traps. I can call pest control. No, no, I just--it's fine. I can't poison, because if I poison it, it dies, it smells, it's not good. I need the traps. I don't know where the darn things are. It's gotta be here. Are you gonna go to the office today? Yeah. That's uh-- you're probably right. I just like being here at home with you guys. It's okay, Frank. You don't have to be by my side every minute. Actually, I'm feeling much better. Guys, I'm gonna go. Come on. Gotta chill out, seriously. This isn't like her, I'm telling you. This isn't like you. Stressing yourself out. Come on. It's okay. I hear from her every day for five years, and then nothing. Sh. Something's wrong. It's fine. It's fine. That's one up. Come on, guys, let's go! We've got the cement here. Come on, don. The time, man. Time. Come on. Listen. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You got six hours to lay that foundation. So get it round the back. Be quick. Come on. You're in trouble. Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. What do you mean I'm in trouble? Haven't you heard? There's a killer on the loose. The teachers are yelling at anyone who steps off the playground. Well, then you're in trouble, too. Yeah. If they catch me. I'm Nicole. Just transferred in this week. I'm Chris. Chris Davis? Well, yeah. You're famous. Your nephew was born during the murders. Did you see him at the hospital? No. No. Gotta run. Hey. Leave it alone. Hey! Don't do that. What are you doing? You scared me. He's sleeping, honey. Let's not wake him up. Okay. I'm sorry. Don't eat too much. Good morning, Mr. Davis. Sorry to intrude. Sergeant Perkins? I've been trying to get in touch with you for a few days, lenore. I figured you must be occupied. Yeah. We really need lenore to come in and talk to the psychologist I talked to you about. If you don't mind. Now? We just woke up. I'm really sorry, but we need you to do this while the events are still fresh in your mind. You see, we have no real leads at the moment. It's vital we do this right away. Well, you know, if it is that important. We can't really bring a newborn into a police station. I brought officer marcos. She's gonna watch the baby while we're gone. It's really not optional. Hey, marnie. I have your mail. Thanks. And there's something for lenore. Can you recall anything from the time you were taken into the delivery room? I remember, uh, the doctor said that it'd be over in a few minutes. And the nurse put something in my lv. And then, uh, I was out. And I woke up in my room. Okay. Um, what about the, the other medical technicians? Is there anything about them? Uh-- the nurse. Um, she was very pretty. I could tell that through her mask. All right. What about sounds? Do you have any memories of things people were saying? I heard, uh, there's something wrong with the baby. You're gonna be okay. There's nothing wrong with the baby. It's coming. Stop. Stop. Um. I really, I really can't do this now. I've told you everything I remember. Come on, we're just getting there. I really-- l-I have to go. Thank you. Have a great day. Daniel? Daniel? Daniel? No! Do not ever, ever, ever eat this! Hey. It's me again. I haven't heard from you still. And I'm starting to get really worried now. You haven't been in touch with any of your professors since the baby was born. What's going on, len? And now I have this letter from the Dean threatening to withdraw your thesis proposal. This is exactly what I was afraid would happen. You'd forfeit the semester. If you need help, I'm here. Please, call me. Okay, I love you. Bye. Hi. No. My, my two angels. Hi. You know, I've been thinking. Now that we have Daniel, well, maybe we should consider getting him up. You know, we should-- the things are so complicated right now. We should talk about it. You know, at least go off to dinner with me like I asked, tonight. You could, uh, you could get all dressed up like you used to. We have the baby. We can get a sitter. Okay. Okay? Great. Great. It'll be fun. I promise. I swear. I gotta shower. Hello. I'm really sorry to disturb you, lenore, but I need to speak with you. Look, l-I told you everything I know. Please. It won't take long. Okay, I'll give you five minutes. You were very upset the other day. Well, um, l have a newborn. I'm slightly emotional. I specialize in treating witnesses of traumatic events. I know the signs. You were recalling something. Okay, I don't think you're listening. I want you to come in to be hypnotized. Absolutely not. It would help you. I don't need any help. I'm perfectly fine. I really can't be more clear about that. You don't look fine. Okay, you need to go. Like now. Ouch! Oh, no. It's okay. Sh. Is it my birthday? So, what do you think? It's amazing. I don't know, I just thought it'd be nice to have a real meal with real napkins and not paper towels. The baby is asleep, so. I don't know, I thought I'd pay attention to the other man in my life. What do you think? It's amazing. Yeah. Okay. Okay, let's eat. You've reached the office of Dr. boldwin. Leave a message after the beep. What the hell is going on? Dispatch. Janey, I'm trying to reach Dr. boldwin all morning. He was supposed to have a meeting with Dr. devale. He never showed. Did he call in? No, he didn't. Look, do me a favor. Call his office. Have him check his calendar. Find out what his last appointments were. Get back to me when you get them. You got it. Honey, that was great. Really. I'm glad. Um, I gotta do some homework if that's okay. Yeah, it's fine. Just let us know if you need any help. Uh, no, I think I'll be fine, thanks. Okay. I'm sorry I've been so, um-- that's okay. It's been a rough couple of weeks. They say it always is with your first. Okay. They don't know the half of it. Uh, I'm gonna go say goodnight to Danny boy. I don't get it. What? How can something so incredibly beautiful have come from us? We're very lucky. I mean, he really does look like an angel. Something from another world. I know. Are we good? Yeah, pretty good. Okay, you wait here. I wanna talk to her alone first. Yeah, okay. Oh, listen. Don't get talking and then leave me out here. It's freezing, okay? Lenore? Hey, it's me. Lenore! Hello! Lenore! Oh, Jesus! You scared the shit out of me. What are you doing creeping around in here? I'm not creeping around. No one answered when I called. The door was unlocked. I figured you'd be in. And I wanted to find you. Well, I'm in here and I have a baby. I'm kinda occupied. Yeah, l-I haven't heard from you. And we got a bill from the hospital. Is there anything you need? Can I help? Sh. Let's go in the kitchen 'cause he's sleeping. It's a him? Can I see? Sh. No, he's sleeping. Let's just go in the kitchen for a minute. Okay. Why haven't you answered any of my calls? I don't know. This whole motherhood thing is, uh, it's an adjustment. You know, at some point you're gonna have to come back to school. Or they're gonna take away your scholarship. I don't think I'm gonna go back to school, marnie. Not now. I knew it. I knew it. As soon as you decided to keep this baby, that was it. You gave up. I have responsibilities. You have a responsibility to yourself. This is exactly why you wanted to terminate in the first place. Remember? Because of this. Why would you say that? What is wrong with you? Len! I, I'm sorry. Okay? Yeah, okay, fine. I shouldn't have brought that up. Look at you. You're a mess. I got my baby now. And, uh, that's everything. No. You can do such great things. I am doing great things. I'm raising my child. If you don't understand-- I understand. I understand that you're throwing your life away. Right. Okay, great. Well, it's my life. And I just don't have time in it for anybody who doesn't understand that. Len! Oh, my God! Oh, my God. Thank you so much for checking up on us. But we're fine. Goodbye, marnie. You know, you're not the first woman to ever have a baby. Well, I sure feel like I am. Harry! Harry. Harry, come on! I wanna go. Come on! Oh, stop fucking about-- oh, my God. Daniel? Daniel. Daniel? Daniel! There's nothing wrong with the baby. There's something wrong with the baby. Honey, are you okay? Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey, hey. It's all right. I can't, I can't. It's okay. It's okay. Talk to me. Talk to me. It's okay, honey. I didn't know what I was doing. When? When I found out I was pregnant, I tried to, um, I was just so scared of losing everything I worked for. You know that I was scared. Okay. The morning I found this website on line, it had these pills and, um-- did you find something? Take a look at this. It's fine. I think it's gonna be fine. We just need to write after them. Or you can give them a call tomorrow morning. And that'll be it. You just need to take like six tablets. Okay? They gave you like a natural miscarriage. It's okay. It's for the best. You've got your whole life ahead of you. Your whole life. I got so sick. I thought I was gonna die. Hey, hey, hey. Get it out. Come on. I immediately regretted it. Then I just kept thinking, "please, God, don't let my baby die. Please, God, let my baby live, please." Okay, all right. Okay, okay, okay. And then I was better and it was fine. It was alive. It was a miracle. I just hope there's nothing wrong with Daniel. Oh, no, he's perfect. I love you. I love you so much. Sergeant Perkins, come in. Perkins. Sergeant, I have some information on Dr. boldwin. Great. Go ahead. He last scheduled appointment the day before yesterday wasn't at his office. No one has seen him since. That don't help us none. But there was a notation in the margin of his book. Looks like he went to lenore harker's home. Yeah, that's-- okay, janey. You tell officer marcos I'm picking her up at five. Will do. There's nothing wrong with the baby. It'll be okay. There's nothing wrong with the baby, lenore. Shut up! Baby, baby. Mommy's coming. I don't need a babysitter. It's not for you. It's for Daniel. You wanna stay home and do it? No. I mean, yeah. Better get a babysitter. All right. What was that about? Daniel. Listen, I know he's your baby and you love him, but he scares the hell out of me. What? He's a baby! Yeah. I'm not so sure about that. Lenny? Lenore? You should go to your room, Buddy. Honey. Why aren't you dressed? We have dinner, remember? I forgot about dinner. Where is he, lenore? Where's the baby? He was just there. Jesus! Where is Daniel? Where is he, lenore? Honey, where is Daniel? He just gets so hungry. Okay. You stay right here, all right? Don't move. I'm so tired. I just can't get him to sleep. I just can't get him to sleep. Frank? It's just a fuse, Buddy. Stay in your room. Okay, okay. Daniel. Lenore! Frank? Lenore? It's sergeant Perkins. Lenore! I'm gonna go round the back. See if they're there. You wait here. Should I call for backup? Let's have a little look first. Okay. Lenore! Lenore! Lenore! Chris! Chris, can you hear me? Chris! Hold it right there, boy. No sudden movements now. Jesus. Jesus. What the fuck is going on? You tell me, Frank. You gotta help me find him. Don't move. Frank? Frank? What's going on? Police. Is anybody in there? I did not kill those people. Good to hear. Now, you're gonna get on the floor real slow. Put those hands behind your head. Come on now, boy. Easy does it. Nice and easy, boy. I swear, you gotta believe me. What the fuck is that? It's my son. What do you mean your fucking son? Hold it right there, Frank. You don't move now. Frank? Daniel.
