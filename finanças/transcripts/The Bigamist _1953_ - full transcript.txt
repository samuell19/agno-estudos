Can I come in now? No. Well, I believe that's everything. I hope so. Yes, it's a lengthy business. You must be tired. I'm so excited. I wish we could take the youngster right home with us. When do you think we can expect to get him. Well it's... Just a minute. I'm afraid I forgot something. You have to sign these. These give admission to check into every detail Of your private life. There. Thank you. Thank you. Well, that does it I think. I'm sorry to have kept you so long, But you understand that we must be most careful. After all, it's a child's life. Our investigation can't be too thorough. How long will it be? Well it all depends. A matter of months perhaps, but we'll keep you... Thank you very much. Eve dear, we'll be late. Good bye and please hurry. Good bye Good bye, thank you. Now can I come in? Yes. Interview report to the directors. Names of applicants... Harry and Eve Graham. She is 32, he's 38. Occupation... traveling salesman for the Setter Sales Corporation, dealing in electrical appliances. The company is owned by the Grahams And was started about four years ago. Mrs. Graham appears to be very capable. She handles the office work. Mr. Graham covers the Los Angeles area Where they hold a sales franchise For the deep freeze concern. Their income... Presently about $20,000. Married... eight years. They... you don't need to wait for me. I'll straighten up. No, I tried that once before and nearly lost my job. You and your cleaning up. Ha, well go on. Go on. You're not disturbing me one bit. Mrs. Graham is unable to have a family. Her problem is of undetermined origin, But we'll check several physicians who have examined Her during the past eight years. They will take an older child, four Or five years of either sex. From the preliminary interview, it's My opinion they would make fit parents, But something bothers me about Mr. Graham. He seemed impatient during the interview... A chip on the shoulder sort of attitude. He... he behaved rather strangely when signing the, The permission to investigate form. Perhaps this is my imagination. I'll report further when I visit the Grahams Home for the customary inspection next week. Well that's that. If all the others was like you there Wouldn't be any babies given away in this state at all. Why are you such an old fuss budget? If you had made a mistake once you Wouldn't want to ever let it happen again, Not where a child is involved. No. Well, good bye dearie. Eve Graham, 22 Sutter Street, and Harry Graham. Hey! What goes on? I couldn't resist him. He's the beginning of a collection. There's a whole army that goes with him. But you haven't heard anything yet. But we will. You'll see. Mr. Jordan looks like Santa Claus, Just like a man who gives babies away. And anyway it's good practice for you being awakened By mechanical toys, or a teddy bear in the face. Maybe later on a football in the tummy. You'll learn to love it. You will love it, won't you? Of course I will. Why do you ask? Then it's just by imagination. The other day in Mr. Jordan's office I Thought maybe you were sorry we'd started the whole thing. I wasn't sorry. It's just that Santa Claus was such a deliberate old codgie He got on my nerves, that's all. How about undoing my blouse? How about getting yourself pulled together? This is Tom Morgan's Saturday with us. You can do the Caesar salad. What else is cooking? Everything you hate. Roast beef rare, potatoes brown... How does that sound, master? Sounds like the perfect wife. Good in the office, great around the house. I wonder if it will like him? Well, if it doesn't I'll keep it myself. I remember other Saturday afternoons, When it was always like this. Long time ago. You know, this really is a beautifully planned apartment. Yes, we think so. Immaculate! You sure you won't have something? A Coke? Could I have a glass of milk instead? Yes, surely sir. Thank you. My stomach, it's my work... all the tension. If you don't mind my saying so Mr. Jordan, I think you take your work much too seriously. It's not worth it. I think it is. By the way, we've begun our investigation on you. How does it look? Everybody speaks very highly of you. But? I've been a salesman too long not to recognize Sales resistance when I see it Mr. Jordan. I have a feeling you don't want us to have the child. I wouldn't say that. Thank you. Well? Am I right? I don't know whether I do or not, at least not yet. I understand you spend a great deal of time In Los Angeles on business. Yes that's right. Then perhaps you would give me the names of some of the people Down there with whom you work. It's all routine nothing more than that. You're very conscientious aren't you Mr. Jordan? Well, I'll drop you a line and refer you To lots of people in Los Angeles. There's something else about me I think you should know. I have a small mole on my right shoulder. Would you like to see it? Mr. Jordan I'm sorry I'm late. That's all right. I was early. What are you two doing in the kitchen? Mr. Jordan's been looking us over. I've seen your home. It's pleasant, very pleasant indeed! W... won't you stay for dinner? Thanks, I can't I have to get back to the office. Lots more paperwork to do there. I'll see you to the door. Thank you. Good bye Mr. Graham. Thank you Mrs. Graham. Thank you. What happened between you two? I'm sorry. I don't know hit me. Sorry? He said he liked you but didn't think you liked him. Anything else? That we could start fixing up that room, And he thought I'd be a good mother. For once Mr. Jordan is right. Well, the star salesman of the Sutter Corporation Had better get on his horse. What time's your plane? 9:15, I've got a date with a Clark Company buyer first thing In the morning. If we can only sell that account. By the time your a father, just think... You can hire one salesman or even two the way Things are going. And you can stay home and run the show. What's this? Are you resigning? Well not exactly. I'll be around to heckle a bit. That's a woman's privilege. Now I've got to pack. No, I'll do it for you, but there's not much to pack. Everything's in Los Angeles. Don't you ever get a hole in your stock? And how do the buttons manage to stay on your shirts? You never bring them home. I've, found a laundry that does It... saves a lot of trouble. I'll only be a minute packing your bag. Yes, I know Harry Graham very well. Like him. He handled our product for several years until... Until what? We didn't fire him if that's what you're getting at. He fired us... got a better deal. I see. I'd give my shirt to get Graham back, And you can tell him I said so. Thank you. Thank you very much. You see the Grahams wish to adopt a child, And we must have certain information. Well isn't that nice. They want to adopt a baby? How long has Mr. Graham made his office here? I guess about two years. Where does he live when he's in Los Angeles? I guess he just lives around... hotels, Motels, wherever he can get in. It's cocktail time, honey! Are you with me? Mr. Jordan, this is Roy Esterly. I'm very pleased to meet you. What line are you in? Mr. Jordan is getting some information on Harry Graham. Harry's not in any trouble. Mr. Jordan's not a cop. I'll tell you later. OK, sweetie. You fill him in on Mr. Exclusive and, When you get through come on back And have a little shot with me? Excuse me, but could I ask you a few questions? Why sure, sure, fire away. What do you know of Mr. Graham? He's a good guy. But you called him Mr. Exclusive. I was kind of kidding I guess. You see we never see him except here in the office, And of course when he's here he's buried in work. You know I can't understand how a guy can Live without a little social life. So he's not a playboy like some cornballs I could mention. Playboy! He's the original Invisible Man! You never see him anywhere. He's not at the hotels, restaurants, nightclubs. Man comes to town and just like that he disappears. Mr. Jordan, I have an idea. I'm sure Harry will be calling, and you Can get everything you want right from him. I'll call the hotels for you. Why don't you just sit over there at Harry's desk. Thank you Miss. Maybe I should see Mr. Graham after all. Yes, I'll wait. As long as you're going to all the trouble, Would you kindly ask the hotel people When Mr. Graham was last registered? Surely, I could do that. Say, Mr. Jordan, your throat Must get pretty dry asking all those questions. How about a little slug? Very kind of you but no thanks. Bob Vance never called did he? No. That's good because I don't want to talk to him. Hello? No, he's in Redland. He'll be back the day after tomorrow. Yes, I'll have him call you. Harrison Graham, Harry Gr... Harrison Graham! Good night. You've really got Harry Graham on your mind. I'm sorry I took so long but the hotels had to check. You know it's funny but he hasn't registered any of them For months. Several of them remember him. Of course he could be staying at a rooming house, But that doesn't sound like him. He likes everything nice. You're very kind. I'm sorry for all the trouble. I... by the way, is Mr. Graham known By any other name than Harry? No, his name is Harry. Look Mr. Jordan, he was in yesterday, And I know I'll be hearing from him soon. Give me a number and I'll have him call you, Or maybe you've gotten everything you need? No, not yet. Excuse me, it's that board. Thank you. Graham, Harrison... Harrison Graham, 132 Brinkman. Wait for me, please. Good evening. Hello, aren't you a little off your beat? Well, I was coming to Los Angeles Anyway for a meeting tomorrow. I'm reading a paper at a welfare convention. How nice. So while I was here I've been doing A little checking up on you. Tell me, why are you listed in the telephone book Under Harrison Graham? Harrison Graham's my real name. You changed it? Some time ago. I thought it sounded a little formal, If you know what I mean. Yeah, but in San Francisco you're listed as Harry. The phone company got it mixed up. Look, I'm dead on my feet. I... I just got home from work a couple of hours ago. Suppose we meet for lunch tomorrow. Maybe we can learn to get along. Well, I'm busy tomorrow, but... I'm sorry I bothered you, But after all it is my job. That's right, I understand. Good night. Good night. It's all right. All right. Pay him off. Tell him to go. You'll wake them both up. My wife's sick, too. Your wife. She's in the other room asleep. She's been up with the baby two nights in a row. How long has this double life of yours been going on? About eight months. And you tried to adopt a child! What are you going to do? Call the police. You can't, not now. Not with her like this. Please, I've got to try to make you understand. Please! I can't believe it. I can't be... How could a man like you... successful, Admired... get into a position as... as vile as this? How? I don't know. I don't know how. Loneliness, I guess. Have you had to spent half you life living in hotel rooms, Eating in restaurants with... with only a newspaper For company, walking the streets looking For a movie you haven't seen? Well, that's the way it was one Sunday afternoon When I was stuck in Los Angeles. I couldn't get home to spend the weekend with Eve. I'd called her, but we didn't talk about us. She was in one of her executive moods... career woman. You've never seen her that way. She's different now. Anyway, when I got off the phone I was twice as lonely. I felt as if the walls of the hotel room Were closing in on me so I decided to go out of a walk. Some men on the road escape their loneliness With women who are easy to get, but that didn't work with me. In all the years of my marriage I Never looked at another woman. Eve was my whole life. Yet sometimes in those years I felt a distance Between us which was more than miles. When we found out we couldn't have children, Eve was bitter and restless. It was my idea her coming into the business. She caught on fast, so fast she'd Doubled our sales in no time. And our marriage, well, it became a business partnership. So on that particular Sunday my aloneness was like a pain. Visit that fabulous Beverly Hills.

You can see I've been a howling success. Come on, sit down? No, I can't. Say, where'd you say that farm was? I didn't. A little place called Pennsylvania. How'd you get all the way to Los Angeles? Well, I wanted to see the world. So you started with China? That's right. You know something? They've never heard of chop suey in China. You don't say. That's right.

Well, thanks for a lovely evening. It was nothing. Drop in again sometime. So long. You know, we've been together seven hours, And I still don't know a thing about you Except that you're the nicest stranger I ever met on a bus. Well, I don't know anything about you either. Let's leave it that way? I will tell you one thing about myself though. What's that? On that bus this afternoon I felt just as lonely as you did. I feel better now. I guess all traveling salesmen aren't alike? Some of us are quite harmless. Yeah, you're kind of special. Good night. I never expected to see Phyllis again, But I knew I'd remember this day when two strangers helped Each other through a lonely Sunday. I felt good again, not very sleepy. We're ready with your call to San Francisco. Yes, thank you operator. Eve? My, two calls in one day! Well never mind darling, this is deductible business. Monkey business, I cheated on you today. I thought you should be the first to know. Haven't you heard, the wife is always the last to know. I'm serious, a beautiful brunette, All curves and soft shoulders. How wonderful! I hope you'll be very happy together. What kind of talk is that? Aren't you even jealous? You won't spoil my sleep one bit. You're mighty sure of me aren't you? I'm very sure of you my darling. She wasn't really beautiful, just Nice, kind of a funny little mouse. Don't you want to know how I made out? I forgot! I heard that Duff's may open three more Retail outlets in Los Angeles county. Got a pencil handy? Better write down this name and address. Are you listening? Here it is. He's the merchandise manager. Yes, I'm listening Eve. I've got it. I wish you were here with me right now. I didn't even touch her. Touch who? You know, the funny little mouse. What a shame. Better luck next time. Harry, I got a special delivery from mother today. What's the news? Father's quite ill. Nothing serious I suppose, but I'm a little worried. I wouldn't worry darling. I'm sure he'll be all right. Eve, I've got to make the rounds. I'll call you in a couple days. Good night. Night. And in a couple of days I did get home, dead tired And a little bit sick of the deep freeze business. I only wanted a weekend with Eve, But she had other plans, big plans. Tom Morgan, our lawyer, was there, and Carl Forbes, Who's a buyer for the Redmond chain. I'd never been able to sell him. Then Eve decided she'd try the woman's touch. Why didn't you ever send your wife in to sell me? She packs quite a punch. Haven't you heard? Eve's the brains, I'm the brawn. Don't listen to him. I'm just Harry's little secretary trying to get along. I was afraid you'd ask me how the thing worked. Well, how does it work? Would you like some more coffee? No thanks, now tell us all about The superior mechanical features. All right, but stop me if this gets too complicated for you.

I'm sorry. Tom? No thanks, no more. How about a little poker? The evening's so nice we might play on the terrace. I'm afraid of you, but I'm game. Me too. Come on Harry, let's have at it. You know, I think we're really on our way. I'm sure we got Forbes. That's the power of a woman for you. I'm so happy. I'm so sleepy. Good night, darling. Eve. I just figured something out. What? In the last month we've be together six days and 14 hours, Not counting when we're asleep. It doesn't make any sense. Did you hear me? Six days, 14 hours. Eve, let's go away tomorrow. Doesn't matter where, just as long as we're together? Of course we'll go away sometime, darling. We'll go to all those glamorous places That Holliday writes about. And we'll do it first cabin, too. Let's not wait, Eve. A marriage is the only thing that really matters. I love our marriage. Good night darling. So I hit the road again, and when I got Back to Los Angeles One tea coming up. Rice cakes and your fortune free. Shall we... Come on, sit down? Just for once. You want me to lose my job? What does it say? You will travel far.

Wow, things are warming up. Do you like to dance? I don't know, it's been a long time. Well, do you want to take a chance with me? All right, when you finish tonight. Where will we go? Why don't we stay here? It's so romantic. You're a little character. Miss Martin, over there. Sorry. See you later. That night we danced. There were other evenings with Phyllis, too.

Good night. Thanks. Well... Phyllis. Yeah? Tomorrow's my birthday. Do you want to have dinner with me, help me celebrate? I'd love to, and tomorrow's my day off. I'll pick you up at 7:00. Sure you haven't anything better to do? I'm sure. OK. Phyllis. Good night, Harry. Good night. See you tomorrow then? At 7:00. Bye. I spent my birthday Trying not to think of Phyllis. Still I felt her closeness. I was finding out that I was not the take it or leave it kind. I knew then I couldn't see Phyllis Again, that night or any night. I felt like someone who walks away from the edge of a cliff Back onto solid ground. I feel pretty low, too, about walking out on her, But it was better this way. Much better. Come in. Tray's over there. Not much of a way to spend your birthday. Phyllis! Didn't you get my message? Well sure I got it. That's why I came over. I was worried. What's wrong. Nothing serious, I think I'll live. Just a headache I couldn't shake. Yeah? Feels better, lots better. I... I brought you a birthday present. It's nothing much, just a Cadillac. Why don't you want to open it? Sure, I'll open it. A bit flashy, but I thought you'd like it. Smells good. I do like it. Thank you, Phyllis. Well, may as well put a gift to work. Just close your eyes now. We'll take that headache away. It's working already. Many happy returns. You know something? The headaches all gone. We're going to have that dinner after all. No, we're not going anywhere. You're going to take it easy. Lady, you have healing powers that are miraculous. I can already hear a soft piano, champagne corks popping, And I know just the place we're going to. We're going to Acapulco. You're crazy. Yes, and I need a shoot, too. Look, I'll go home and get into something slinky, Then pick me up in 15 minutes? All right, I'll get into something real uncomfortable. You kill me. See you. It's such a lovely night. This is going to be even better than the last bottle. I'm glad your birthday only comes once a year. This once was worth it. Acapulco. You know I never thought I'd make it. And only 30 minutes from downtown. You know you fall in love here. It goes with the check. When did you make that up? Just now. Have you ever been in love? I've tried it. You know what I think? I think you feel in love once, got hurt, And have been running away ever since. Am I right? I bet you read poems, too. Yeah, he was with the occupation forces in Germany. You've heard of those Dear John letters haven't you? Yeah, sure. Well I got a Dear Phyllis. Seems I lost out to a little Fraulein. I guess all men are no good? I don't know. I think there are one of two nice ones left in circulation. Here's looking at you Phyllis. Thanks. The stars were very bright, But it wasn't the stars... Well you're a funny one. Why? Don't you want to know if there's someone in my life, Whether I'm married, divorced, or have six children, Whether I've spent any time in jail? No. Why not? What could would it do me if I did know all those things? I like you as you are, the way we are. I don't want anything from you, and I'm Afraid of being in love again. I touched your hand. The spell you cast was a magic glare. We watched the moon in flight, but it Wasn't the moon that thrilled me. No it wasn't the moon that brought such delight. I felt a thrill so new the moment I kissed you. The heavens faded from sight. No it wasn't the stars, and it wasn't the moon... You know I'm going away again tomorrow. Tomorrow's a long time off. Eve? Eve! Eve. What's wrong? Darling, I'm so glad you're back. What's the matter? Father's had a heart attack. His condition's critical, and I have to go at once. Poor baby, I'm sorry. He's such a great guy. Do you want me to go with you? Thanks, but you better stay here and take care of things. Anyway I got the last seat on the plane. What time? 10 o'clock, I change planes at New Orleans for What about money? We're out of cash to check How was the trip? Pretty good. We got the Barlow account, but it took some doing. Good boy. Hunt, Hills and Ventura is complaining About factory deliveries. I got that all straightened out. Fine. Well I'll take care of the office here until you get back. If you need any help, call. I'll hop a plane. Maybe he'll pull out of it? I hope so. I almost forgot. How lovely! You like it? I'm crazy about it! Put it on for me will you? What do I have to thank for this? All that new work with Barlow's or that cute little mouse You told me about? Did my boy step out of line? Thank me. And I'll do it like this. Eve, this last trip... it's no good Being away from each other. How would you like me to be around all the time? Could you stand it? What do you mean? One of these days soon we'll put a man on. I've got my eye on a fellow. I think I'm going to cry. I should be so happy if it weren't that... Finish your packing, darling. I'll make us a couple of drinks. I've been thinking about something. What is that? About your being here with me all the time. I didn't realize home meant that much to you. I've been so wrapped up in the business That I thought you liked things the way they are, Traveling around and meeting people. I did, but I've had it. Now I want to stay put. And I was wrong about something else, too. Wrong? For nearly four years, ever since the doctor said no baby, I hated myself, and you, and everybody. I was resentful when you suggested adopting one. I couldn't see taking care of somebody else's child. Remember that? Yes, I remember. I was wrong. What made you think of it now, after so much time? Maybe it was the telegram from home. I suddenly thought how much my family meant to me, And how much they loved me, and it seemed selfish Not to pass it along to a little child that needed it. Even if it isn't your own? That doesn't seem to make any difference. Do you still want one? Yes, of course I do. Well then would see maybe about getting one while I'm away? Yes I will, Eve. Tomorrow morning, the very first thing. I thought you'd forgotten all about it, That the business was our baby. Will you forgive me for taking so long? Yes, I forgive you. Announcing the departure of American Airlines flight Number 516 to Atlanta and New Orleans, connecting with Miami. All aboard please. Well that's us. So that's how I first crossed your path Mr. Jordan. I called you on the phone wanting to know how to start. We wanted a little boy or a little girl, Didn't make any difference which. And we wanted it faster than any child Had ever been adopted before. But you told me it wasn't as easy as all that, And how right you were. Yes. You wanted to ride roughshod over all our rules. Then what changed you? What happened after that? I stayed close to the business except for three Flying trips to Florida. You see Eve's father had improved, But it took a lot out of her mother and she collapsed. It went on month after month. There was nothing Eve could do except stay there. It had been over three months since I'd Seen any of our accounts. The business showed it. I had to make the rounds. I did my work. I didn't see anybody but the customers in Los Angeles. Of course I thought of Phyllis. I wanted to see her, but not the way I saw her the last time. Anyway, before I left town I dropped in at the Canton Cafe. Hi Sam. Hello Mr. Graham. We missed you. Thanks Sam. Miss Marin here? Phyllis? No, she doesn't work here anymore. When did she leave? About a month ago, maybe a little more. Was anything wrong? She says she wasn't well. See was going away. Where? She didn't say. Will you have dinner here tonight, Mr. Graham? No, no thank you. Thanks Sam. Yes? Is Miss Martin in? Miss Phyllis Martin. What do you want? My name's Harry Graham. I'm an old friend of hers. Does she still live here? She still lives here, but, she isn't feeling well. She doesn't want to see anyone. Well I've got to see her. You remember me don't you? Mr. Graham? I've spoken to you on the phone several times. Y... yes I remember. Come in. Thank you. I think she needs you. Her room's right up there, first on the left. Come in. Harry! Hello Phil. What's wrong? Nothing. It's good to see you again. I just go back from San Francisco, I've been working there for the last few months. I went to the restaurant and they told me. And I had trouble getting past your guard downstairs. Well, now that you found me again, H... how are things in the deep freeze business? What was it, hot water heaters? Phil. What did the landlord mean just now When she said "she needs you?" I don't know. Come on. Look, I don't need anybody. I can take care of myself. I'm a big girl now. Phil. Yeah? Was it that night? My birthday. It's yours if that's what you mean. I know. Harry, you don't have to do anything about it. But I want to do something about it. No, I don't trap my men this way. You're free just as you always were. Why didn't you want to see me? What were you afraid of? I don't know, I guess maybe I was Afraid you wouldn't want me to have it. Well, I don't think I could stand that. You see, I never had anything of my own until now. Don't be afraid. Of course I want you to have the baby. I'll take care of everything. Don't worry. I've got some things to do. You stay here and rest a while. I'll be back later. Good. And Phil, I'm glad, terribly glad I found you. So am I. You get some rest. Mr. Graham? Mr Graham, this is Dr. Wallace. He's taking care of Phyllis. I was just going up to see her. How is she, doctor? Could I speak to you for a minute? Yeah, sure. Excuse me. Of course. I think she's going to be all right. She's had a rough time of it this last month. Two transfusions, and she's not very strong to start with. Then there's the mental emotional state To contend with. You can understand. Yes, I understand. I think things will be better now that you're here. I'll take care of everything. Please give her the best. I'm glad she means something to you. She can be hurt just like the rest of us. Fooled me at first with that flip, hard act of hers. But that's not the real Phyllis. You must know that. How can a man call a woman his wife for eight Years, someone whom you love and who loves you? How can you call her and tell her That you must have a divorce? Worse than that, you've been unfaithful. You're going to be a father. How can you hurt someone so much? Hello? Eve? Harry, I've been trying to reach you. What is it Eve? Your father? About an hour ago. I'm sorry darling. I'm sorry. I'll have to stay with mother a while, And then I'll come home to you. Can you hear me? Yes, of course I can hear you. Are you all right Harry? Yes of course I'm all right, Eve. Give your mother my love and... And take care of yourself. Good bye. Good bye. Hello Phyllis. Hello. I forgot to ask you something. Yeah? What's that? Will you marry me? No, not this way. I'm not asking you. I'm asking you. I hate to take you out of circulation like this. There must be a waiting line. There's nothing like that, and no one like you. Are you sure you want me? I'm sure. I do love you Harry. And I'm so glad I do. I stayed with her until she fell asleep. You may laugh Mr. Jordan, but for the first time I felt needed. I loved Eve, but I never felt she needed me. How did you expect to get away with it? I didn't. What did you do when Mrs. Graham came home A few weeks after your other marriage? Why didn't you tell her plainly? Wasn't that the plan? Yes, that was the plan. That was also the time when you came in again, Mr. Jordan. Will you have some cream? Ho! I have been away a long time. I never take cream. Remember me? I'm sorry, I forgot. I have a surprise for you. A surprise? A sentimental surprise. Come on, bring your coffee. Eve, there are some things we've got to talk about. Father wanted you to have this watch. It was grandfather's, and then when father and mother married It was a wedding gift to the groom. Grandfather said that having a watch and chain Made a man feel more like a man. Sort of like a I suppose. I wish I could have thanked him for it. Well he told me to tell you to take very good care of it, Because it should be passed down to our son. He said it was a lucky watch and should be kept in circulation. Our son... I'm... I'm glad he didn't know How I'd let you down. You haven't let me down. You couldn't Yes I did. When I learned I couldn't have a child that's When I became the little efficient white collared girl. I forgot some things. You didn't forget. Maybe I became absentee husband. We wanted to show the business world We were smarter than the rest. And we did show them. Listen Eve. Come on, I've got another nice surprise for you. The light doesn't work. Leave the door open so we can see. I cleaned it up today. Don't worry about your golf clubs. I put all our junk in the closet and I stored the suitcases. I think it's going to be very nice when we get it fixed up. Go a little slower Eve, I'm not with you. Remember Mr. Jordan? Mr. Jordan. When I left for Florida you said You'd look into the adoption business And you told you about Mr. Jordan. Yes, now I remember. I spoke to him on the phone. What about him? Well that's the surprise! I called him this morning. He said he wanted to see us both, But he thought he could help us. Of course, it may be a while. So you decided to go ahead and fix the place up. Well I know it was impulsive, but I couldn't wait. I thought we'd put the bed here and, um, the chest of drawers Over here. And one of those little rubber tubs In cases he's too small to use ours. Like it? You still do want a child, don't you? Is adopting a baby terribly important to you? Yes, more important than I ever knew before. Except for you, it would mean everything to me. All right then. I guess we'll go see Mr. Jordan. So that's how I crossed your path once more, Jordan. What was in your mind? Did you think you could live this lie for a lifetime? Well, when I realized how much a child meant to Eve I decided to help her by staying married Until the baby became legally ours. Then I'd get out of her life. I must say, that was both a gallant And a foolish scheme. Those were months of panic, fear, Like the night my son was born prematurely Just as the doctor predicted. Mr. Graham. Mr. Graham, you have a little boy. You can see him through the window down there. The axe began to fall one day not so long Ago when I'd just gotten in from San Bernardino. I'd stopped by the office to clean up my desk. It was Eve's and my anniversary. I had tried to get home, but I couldn't make it. Is there a man in this joint that's Been married eight years? Eve! Don't look so shocked. I'm your anniversary present. I almost didn't find you. I called all over the state. And where are you staying? I'm not. I just got back from San Bernardino. Did you get my flowers? I didn't wait for that. I got your wire and decided something Should be done about it. So here I am, aren't you glad? Of course I am. I was just about to call you. Never mind that. How about, closing up the store and buying me a dinner? You bet I will. As a matter of fact we're doing so well I'll put it on the expense account. Let's get started on our ninth year. After dinner Eve Wanted to take a walk I was afraid every step of the way, Yet I tried to get into the holiday spirit for her sake. For a moment it was like old times, until... Mr. Graham! If you're going home, could you give me a lift? Some other time. See you Ricky. Who's he? Store executive's son. I have dinner at that place now and then. What did he mean by home? The Chapin Park Hotel. I stayed there a while back. They live nearby. How about a nightcap? Love it. After I put Eve on the plane For San Francisco I came home to Phyllis and more Of my insane double life. I was beginning to act and think like a criminal, Afraid to be found out yet sick of deceit and lies. Hello Phil. Danny asleep? That's right. All right, Phil. Out with it. Surprised you came back. What do you mean? Let it go. No Phil, I won't let it go. I want you to tell me. All right, if you must know I'm feeling a little cheap, That's all. Ricky. Worse than that... Ricky's mother. She couldn't wait to phone me all the grisly details. Made a wonderful story out of it. You know, just like the Sunday papers. Husband supposed to be out of town Secretly meets another woman. Secretly! You might have done a neater job of it Harry. Yes... yes you're right. Getting awfully excited over one, aren't I? There must have been others. No, no others. That's a comfort. I'm behaving like a fool. After all I dragged you into this marriage. Stop it, don't say that. It's not true and you know it. Leave me alone, will you? Listen to me. There's something I've got to tell you. Please, just leave me alone. Phil... Phil you must listen! Harry, get out will you? Phil! Get out. I stayed at a hotel that night, Made a date to see Phyllis the next day. There were things we had to talk about. She said she'd meet me in the park near the house. It's hard to explain my thoughts as I sat there. I had my way out. Now I could put an end to this nightmare. I loved Phyllis and our child. I didn't want to lose them, and I hated to bring them pain. Hello, Phyllis. Hi. Cigarette? No thanks. How's Danny? He's fine. I had Miss Higgins come over and sit with him. You look tired. Yeah? Well I didn't sleep too well last night. Neither did I. What did you want to talk about Harry? I've been thinking. I could manage $85 a week. Can you and Danny make it? Sure. You can get the divorce and all that, And I'll pay for everything. I'm sorry it had to happen this way. I never meant to hurt you. I'll come around later and get my things. OK, any time. Good bye, Phil. Good bye. Harry! This is crazy. I can't go through with it. I guess you just gave my ego a kick. Will you forgive me? I do love you so you big lug. You know why I didn't sleep last night? I kept thinking about our marriage. You know, the way we got into it. I wasn't fair to you. Don't say that Phil. Never, do you hear me? Please, take me home will you? You really want me to? Yes. We need you. Come on. So you had your out and couldn't take it. And yet all the time you knew it had to end this way. And now you're going to call the police. Well, maybe I ought to thank you. I'd like a taxi at 132 Brinkman Street please. That's right, thank you. I'm not a policeman. It's not my duty to do anything but see that the juvenile wards Of the state of California are given decent homes. I'll pick up my taxi outside. I can't figure out my feelings towards you. I despise you and I pity you. I don't even want to shake your hand, And yet I almost wish you luck. Dearest Phyllis, just a moment ago I watched your sweet face as you slept Knowing I had to hurt you again. When I tried to say good bye to Danny it was almost unbearable. I cannot expect you to understand What I'm about to tell you. Darling, how wonderful you're here! Why didn't you tell me? I couldn't. I have to go away. Go away? Where? I can't explain now. There isn't time. L There's isn't time... What do you mean? Tell me! I wanted to tell you. That's why I came back. But now there are... There are people Waiting for me downstairs. People? What are you saying? All I can do is pray that one day you'll forgive me. Try to remember one thing. I love you. I've always loved you. But you can't go away like this. I love you too! Dearest, it's the only way. Tom Morgan will call you. He knows all about it. Harry! Harry. Hello? Eve, it's Tom. Yes Tom, tell me now. Harry's Been married Harry Graham is in no sense a hero, certainly. But neither is he a monster. He's an ordinary man that made one terrible mistake. In this case there's a peculiar sense of irony. If Harry Graham had taken Phyllis Martin as his mistress Some people would have winked an eye and turned their head. But because he gave her and the child She bore him his name and an honorable place In the community he must be utterly destroyed. Now, I don't deny that the defendant should be punished, But I do believe that in this case punishment Might well be tempered with mercy. Thank you. As the prosecutor has pointed out, There are many bigamous marriages Going on that nobody knows about. The prosecutor is also quite correct in observing that this Is a condition which strikes at the very roots of our society. Please, stop it. I'm guilty. Why go on talking about it? As the counsel for the defense has brought out, There's irony in this case... tragic irony. I suspect that the defendant may have Even loved both these women. Perhaps he even needed them both. I also suspect that he may now have lost them both. When he's once more a free man it won't be a question Of which woman he'll go back to, but rather Which woman will take him back. That decision is theirs. Under any circumstances, he'll be forced To continue to support them both, And he will legalize the status of his son By naming him in his will. These are decent women, Mr. Graham. You're basically a decent man, and that's the whole point. When a man, even with the best intentions, Breaks the moral laws we live by, We really don't need man made laws to punish him. He'll find out that the penalty of the court Is always the smallest punishment. Sentence will be passed for this court One week from this day at 11:00 AM. The court is adjourned.
