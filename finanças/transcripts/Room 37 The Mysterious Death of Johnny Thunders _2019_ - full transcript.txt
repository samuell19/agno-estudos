Well, sir, the check-out time is 10:00 a.m. Did you leave some personal items or... No, I'm not... I'm not checking out of a room. I'm checking into a room. Oh. [CHUCKLES] I'm so sorry. I had you confused with another guest. All right, well, why don't we go on down to the front desk? I will get you checked right in. All right. Say, is that, uh... Is that the hair of a rock star I notice? I've come to recognize the type. No, it's just me being me. You just arrived? Yeah. - How do you like it so far? - [BELL DINGS] I like it so far. [CHUCKLES] Good. All right. Here is your room key. And this is my card. It's got our main number, in case you need to get in touch with me. You'll be in room 37. There's someone already booked in that room. Thirty-seven? Nonsense. I've already asked for it to be cleaned and ready. I'll be damned if one of our maids hadn't already cleaned it for ya. [CHUCKLES] All righty. Here you go. Room 37. If you need anything at all from us, just give us a call at the front desk. Our staff's extremely attentive. Hey, I'll tell you what? We got free coffee down there in the mornings. Plus, for lunch, it's the best dang gumbo in the South. So, uh, anything else? JOHNNY: No, that's all right. Here. - Take that. - Oh. Oh, thank you for your kindness, sir. Thank you. WOMAN: Well, it's not pretty, but it's clean. I knew, I cleaned this room yesterday. Is everything all right, sir? It's fine. It's all right. Here for business, sir, or pleasure? Maybe a little bit of both. Say, what's a pretty face like yours doin' in a place like this, anyways? This town is not as bad as people say it is. Seems like a pretty good place to get away for a while. Get away from what? Everything. So, do you got a name, or should I just keep calling you "pretty face"? My name is Iris. And you, sir? Just Johnny. [CHUCKLES] Well, Just Johnny, if you need anything, you know where to find me. I've lived here for quite a while. I can tell you where to find all the jewels of the city. Say, talkin' about jewels of the city, what's the best place to go for a drink around here? There's a good spot right up the street. A good rock 'n' roll bar. You'd like it. Thanks, babe. Don't mention it. IRIS: Ms. Alexander... You're gonna let me clean your room today? [MRS. ALEXANDER WHEEZING] [COUGHS] - [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON CASSETTE PLAYER] - Oh, it's great. It's wonderful. Yeah, it's just how everybody says it is, huh. They got the greatest music in the world here. I'm telling you. I'm telling you, I was taking a cab over to the hotel, and I walk down the street, and there's people just singing up and down the street. I'm doing fine. Yeah. Yeah. No, no, no. My health's good.

No. All right? I don't trust those guys. I don't... Okay, listen. I got a surprise for you. I got something for you. And I'm not gonna let you down this time, okay? So, are you listenin'? I got $20,000 right here. $20,000 that I made in Japan and Germany. I'm gonna pay for your mortgage. I'm gonna send you money in the next couple of days, okay? Sylvain's gonna call me in a couple of minutes. And uh, I can't make calls from here, so, I think I need to hang up soon, just to make sure I get his call. Okay, and listen, you better call me. Okay? If, if, if you get a... If you get a call from her, then just get back to me, all right? I wanna know where they are. And I wanna see... I really wanna see 'em again and...

That's it. Fine and simple. All right? I'm not going on stage with that clown after he did all that Buster Poindexter shit. He sold out. SYLVAIN: We're all in a different place in our lives, also. JOHNNY: Hey, there's not enough room on stage for the two of us, okay? He takes up all the room. SYLVAIN: Why don't you talk to him, Johnny? I suggest you get yourself a new guitar player who's gonna stand in a spot while David struts around and sings all the songs. Or, or if you don't want David to be involved, I'll play with you. I'll play with you. I'll play with Jerry. I'll play with Arthur. SYLVAIN: Just give it some time and think about it, Johnny. All right, man. Have a good one. Yeah, you take care of yourself, too. We all miss you, man. - Talk to you later. - Just think about it. Bye-bye. Bon voyage, baby.

Earlier it was making some noise. [WATER TRICKLING] [WATER BUBBLING] [SCREAMS] [PANTING] [WIND BLOWING] [DOOR CREAKS] [MRS. ALEXANDER WHEEZING] [COUGHING] [GASPS] Hey!

Can you explain it one more time? Mrs. Alexander did... I don't know what else to say. I don't know how else I can make myself any more clear. She was in here and now my shit's gone. My passport, my ID. - My money, my medicine, it's all gone. - Calm down. Hey, don't tell me to calm down. I am calm. You are not listening to me. She was right here. Right fucking here. All right. This is beyond ridiculous. You think I'm making this up? Earlier, you said she was not in her room. You can try to get a hold of one of her grandsons and see if they can find her. I can assure you that Mrs. Alexander is too old. She's not even capable of breaking into other people's rooms. She hasn't really been able to talk or walk in years, Johnny. Then where is she? Huh? How far could she have gone? How hard could this be? Where is she? Look, I am sorry that your stuff is missing, or it was stolen, or whatever. But it's really up to our guests to make sure that the door is... Wait, wait, wait. What are you trying to tell me right now? Are you trying to tell me it's my fault that I got robbed? Is that what you're trying to say right now? This is your hotel. You run this hotel. It's your responsibility, okay? My room was broken into, and I got robbed. You understand? I can't come in and lock the door behind the guest after they come in or when you leave. Look, I will call you if I hear anything or see anything. You didn't hear this from me, but you can always go to the hospital to, you know, feel better. [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] Sorry, but I cannot help you. Next? No, look, seriously. No. My ID was stolen, okay? I'm on vacation. I swear I have a prescription and the paperwork. Sir, methadone is not a recreational drug. And you can only get the recommended dosage with a valid prescription. - But I do have a prescription. - Sir, I gotta get through this line. What would you rather have me do, huh? Get loaded in the street? You're denying me treatment? If you have a prescription, we can call your doctor's office and have them verify. I need my medication now. Look, listen. Okay, what can I do? Look, look. Listen. Look, please. - Can I just buy those from you? - Sir, we don't just hand out drugs. Can you just tell me where I can get a dose? I would suggest that you talk to your doctor. Next? [GRUNTS] They keep making it harder and harder. Every year, same bullshit. Do you have an appointment? You have a doctor? Do you have a prescription? Here's your fucking prescription. [CHUCKLES] Give a man a mask, he'll show you his true face. Ain't that right, homeboy? What do you need, man? Weed? Uppers? Downers? I got all kind of merchandise to make you feel real happy. Like royalty. - Look, I'm not looking for a fix, all right? - You're not? Everybody's looking for a fix, man. Where you from? - Not around here. - No. What do you... What are you? I'm a musician. Musician. Goddamn! I'm a musician. Well, was a musician. Yeah. Do you know any methadone clinics around here? Methadone. It's tricky to find some of that shit around this joint. I do know of a place though. Deep down in the woods. Say they got crates of the shit out there, like motherfucking Mayflower crates, yo. The story goes, couple of fellas I know busted into a hospital and stole a crate of that shit. Guess who's got that crate? You do? [CHUCKLES] No. But I know who does. See, my brother, Jimmy, he was on that shit. You seem like an all right guy. So I'll let you in on a little story. Jimmy came in here once. jonesing, looking for a fix. Wasn't able to shoot up. Didn't have any methadone. Hmm. He was real sick, [CLICKS TONGUE] and little funny in the head. See that spot right there? That's Jimmy's blood. He threw it up when he got denied. Guess he needed that real bad. Said he was seeing shit. Like, some real crazy shit. Did he tell you what he saw? No. But I really wouldn't wanna know. Would you? Where is this place? Tell him Skaggs sent you. [CROWS CAWING] - [DOOR OPENS] - [CLATTERING] Hello? What the fuck you think you're doing in my house, huh? Oh, hey, man. Uh... I, uh... I got a piece of paper. - You got a piece of paper. - Yeah. Huh? Well, pull it out. Show me. Show me your piece of paper. - Ah. Hold on. Yeah. - [COIN CLANGS] - Huh. - JOHNNY: It's... I had it right fucking... I had it right fucking... See, uh, your name's Eagle, right? Skaggs sent me over here. I met him at the hospital. He told me about his brother Jimmy. He said I could buy some methadone off of you. Jimmy. That piece of shit. Jimmy [LAUGHS] has entirely too much going on up here. Huh? A little too much junkie business. You wouldn't want that to happen to you now, would you? - No, no, no. - No. No. No. No. - No. I didn't think so. - (CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY) You know, people swear that Jimmy could see himself descending into the lower levels of hell. But you? Goddamn, boy. You look like you've been there. You know, as a matter of fact, you look like you're still there. (CHUCKLES) Yeah. Let me tell you something. I have no need for you or your business. So, you get the fuck out of here before you burn a hole in this spot, - you got me? - No, listen, man. I'll buy some methadone off of you. 100 bucks, man. All right? And I'll give you $100. $500. I don't have that kind of cash on me. Sure you do. So reach into your little pocket, pull it out, and put it in my hand. You place that right here, and we got a deal. I will hook you the fuck up. But if you don't, I'ma castrate you and feed you your own bits... All right, man. Calm down. Calm down. I got the money. It's right here. Here. Look here. See that? That's all I got. That's all... That's all, all here. All right. I'll hook you up. Go on. After you. - Thanks, man. - Yeah. - Is this it? - Yeah. Thanks a lot, man. Jamie. - [GAGS] - [GLASS SHATTERS] [COUGHING] [GROANS] What do you think Jamie saw? Must've been something really fucked up. Oh, yes, because... Oh, you're about to find out first-hand. [EAGLE SCOFFS] [CHUCKLES] [RATTLE, WATER DRIPPING] [GASPING] JAMIE: Dad. [GASPS] Morning, Johnny. Do you want me to change your sheets? [COUGHS] You came in pretty late last night. Rough night? Johnny. I ain't gonna lie, but I have to let you know. I know this is dumb. Stupid. You probably get this all the time, but... You're Johnny Thunders. The New York Dolls. I recognized you the second I saw you. It's a shame that band had to end so quickly, but... I know that hasn't stopped you. I'm glad you like the band. That's good. That's good. I saw my drummer. His name was Billy. He died of an overdose back in '72. (GASPS) You don't understand. This ride, it comes at a price. And Billy bought himself a one-way ticket, and he never came back. When he overdosed, the guys he was getting loaded with, they put him in a bathtub and they force-fed him coffee. They tried to wake him up, but he choked to death. You get no respect until you're dead. Oh, well... [SIGHS] He kind of tasted the life, Billy. But this kind of lifestyle killed him. I saw his ghost in there. And I think he's trying to tell me something. Fuck! [SOBS] All my shit's gone. How am I gonna get back? How am I supposed to get better if my medicine... IRIS: I'm sure you're going to be just fine. [JOHNNY SOBS] My wife left me, Iris. She took the kids away from me. And it was all my fault. (SOFTLY) Hey, look... Why don't you just go see them? I can't. I can't. They won't let me. Not until I get clean. Not until I get better. I gotta get better. That's why I came here. I gotta get better. I need to heal. Music heals. [GUITAR STRINGS TWANG] This thing looks like it could use some love. It's always helped you before, hasn't it? [SNIFFLING] [STRUMMING GUITAR] Ms. Alexander... Did they tell you what happened to her? Ms. Alexander died last night. Her folks are coming to collect her belongings. [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] [JOHNNY COUGHS] Did I get any calls? Nope. Send the bell cart up to my room. - It's time for me to check out. - [KEYS CLANK] So soon. That's unfortunate. It's cool, man. $60 even. All right. Sir? Uh... You know what? I was thinking, uh... I was thinking maybe I should stay one more night, you know. Thanks, thanks a lot. Yeah. Just one more night. Sir? Sir? [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [STRUMMING GUITAR] That sounds great, Johnny. That is what I'm talking about. It's magic, brother. [CHUCKLES] I get to listen to it every day. I can't believe I get paid to do it. Hey, man, I'm gonna play back your mix right in your headphones. So you can get fresh with it. And we'll record once you're feeling it. So, go ahead and take a listen. JOHNNY: Can you turn it up, man? I'm not getting anything on my end at all. Is this thing on? I said turn it up. I can't hear it. I got you solid, man. [RATTLE, WATER DRIPPING] CLIFF: Sorry, man. Was that too loud? JOHNNY: Ah, something's wrong. Uh... Can you try it out on your end?

Pretty good, pretty good. Thank you so much. I just wanted to thank you for bringing him in. - You know, he's a great dude, I gotta say. - Yeah. But I mean, you know, before all the New York Dolls stuff, I mean, he's... Aside from all that New York Dolls stuff, man, he was doing all these different side projects. He's been working his ass off. I mean, this guy's gonna be the next Keith Richards. [STRUMMING GUITAR] CLIFF: Hey, man, while you're in there, can you give me a guitar check? Just a couple of chords. Can you give me that again? Just one more chord. You know what? I'm gonna bring you another guitar. It sounds like there's something in the body. Oh. Really?

[COUGHING] Weren't you here earlier? Yeah. Your name is Frank, right? Frank? Uh... Yeah, yeah. Uh... Yeah, I was... I guess I made a wrong turn a couple of doors down and ended up here. So, I thought I'd just, uh, grab my medicine and check in with you guys later. Follow me. I'll take a look at your file, get your medicine, send you on your way. Listen, I need my medicine now. Yes, understood. But I'm going to look at you first. You'll be out of here in no time. Follow me... [COUGHING] All righty. You just sit tight right there, buddy. A little while longer and we'll get you your medicine. Thanks, thanks a lot. Thank you. [DOCTOR MUMBLES] This looks like leukemia. Have you been checked? Uh, I just had a rough night last night. Hmm. Certain illnesses follow certain patterns. Body tends to bruise, and has trouble healing. About this methadone, when did you have your last dose? Too long. Way too long. I'm seeing things. - Hallucinations? - Yeah. Methadone withdrawal doesn't cause hallucinations. That would be a hallucinogenic drug. Have you been taking hallucinogens? No, I swear. I swear. I haven't been taking them. I hate hallucinogens. Well... I want you to feel better. This will help. No, you need to sign this. [GUNSHOT] Well... You know, some people just don't listen.

You know what? You are one lucky son of a bitch. You know that? 'Cause if I hadn't killed that piece of shit, you might've done some business with him. Get up... Does this bother you? Here. I'ma put this over here. See? All gentle-like. Chill out. We had a real good time last time, right? - [WHIMPERS] Yeah, we did. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Didn't we? Yeah. Yeah, we had... We had a really good time. - We had a great time. - We had a great time. - That's right. - [LAUGHS] Yeah, yeah. We had a great time. Hey, uh... Yeah. I think I'm gonna bounce. Whoa! Slow your roll there, lookie-loo. - Oh, no... - Give me the fucking thing! I just wanna see it. Right? Let me see what you got here. Man. You want some of this? It would be a crying shame if you leave all empty-handed. Man, you were so close. [SNIFFS] I bet you can taste it. You can smell it, can't you? Want it? Ah! Tell you what? All you have to do is pay the price. How much do you want? Now, that's cute, rock star. I'm gonna say the second verse as the same as the first. And that is $500. I don't have any money on me, man. - Are you lying to me, man? - No. No. You got it on you? Hold on. I think, uh... I think I got $100 down here somewhere. Uh... One sec. Uh, let me just see if I, uh... [COCKS GUN] [WHIMPERS] Are you doing me dirty? Huh? You know, I like you. So I'ma tell you this just one time. Go fuck yourself, rock star. Huh?

Do you ever have a dream where it feels so real, and you just keep trying to wake up. But the harder how you try, the deeper and deeper you fall into sleep until you just... Our whole lives are a dream. Then we die. But you're gonna be just fine. Have you seen anything strange around here? Just anything out of, out of the ordinary? This whole town is evil. Aside from all the colorful Mardi Gras and stuff. It has a dark past. Some say the spirits of the dead still live on in the city. Never did move on, so... Yes, Johnny. I have seen my fair share of things that can't be explained. I saw a spirit in here last night. What'd you see? I watch the front desk, so I was in the lobby all by myself. But last night, this figure came from the end of the hall. But it just stood there. It was like it was looking at me through the frosted glass. How did you know it was a spirit? My friend, Namira. She's a palm reader. She's into all that voodoo stuff. She gave me her palm deck. This is what I saw. Hey... Hey, it was probably just there because Ms. Alexander passed away last night. You're gonna be okay. Ms. Alexander... how did she die? They found her in her bathtub. She must've fallen asleep and died. But you are gonna be just fine. Yeah? Yeah. I'm gonna be fine. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] - [KNOCKING ON DOOR] - [COUGHS] NAMIRA: Who is it? The name's Johnny. What do you want? I don't have any further appointments today. And I don't accept walk-ins. I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to come back another day. Listen, I got nowhere else to go, all right? Iris sent me here. Uh... Who? My friend, Iris. I've been close to death many a time, Johnny. In some cases, I stare right into the eyes of demons themselves. I can sense death as clear as you coming into this room. It is best, Johnny, if we seek your future, not your past. The hanged man. The old must die to replace the new, Johnny. And there will be a change in your future, for the best, or for the worst. You collapse. This will be painful, Johnny. What is this? [NAMIRA GASPS] The end of something. But what? I think he is already here. At the end of the road. Waiting for me. You will continue down a deep path that will twist and turn at every corner, which will ultimately lead to no escape. To a bear trap, Johnny. Fueled by your addictive desires. [GASPS] The cup of five. What are you trying to say here? I have a drinking problem or something? Is that what this is about? Dealing with loss, Johnny. Oh, so what? You're saying I have a drinking problem? You're saying I'm gonna drink myself to death, huh? That's what you're saying. to me? That's what this is all about, huh? You misunderstand, Johnny. I barely had anything to drink since I flew into this joint to begin with, all right? The drink. Guy bought you a drink. Says he's your biggest fan. [CLANGING] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING, COUGHING] [COUGHS] [GASPS] [GASPS] [STIFLES SOB] [GASPS] "Give a man a mask, "and he will show you his true face." SKAGGS: Thanks for a hell of an escape too. I just step out on that street and ride in with all the other carnival freaks. Hmm. Hallucinate much? [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Lysergic acid diethylamide. LSD. Guy bought you a drink. Says he's your biggest fan. Why did you do this to me? [CLICKING TONGUE] Man... Can't believe I saw you out back in that hospital. You got Eagle killed. And you killed Ms. Alexander. Hmm. Grandma? We just left her alone for a little while. She just simply slipped away. Where's the money? [SCOFFS] What are you talking about? I know who you are. Grandma said you had a shit ton of money. You fuck up, where is it? I know who you are. You're Johnny Thunders, the rock 'n roller. The lifestyle, the drugs, the fame. You don't know me... What happened to that Johnny Thunder fame? You throw it away? What happened to that Johnny Thunder money? She took it. Who? - Your grandma. - Motherfucker! Where is it? Where the fuck is it? I don't know. I live in a fucking shack! Where the fuck is the money? [SNICKERING] [LAUGHING] [PANTING] JAMIE: Dad. Jamie. Where are you? [COUGHS] [BREATHING HEAVILY] Where are you? Where are you? Where are... [SOBBING, MUMBLING] Where are you? [MUMBLING] [RETCHES] [COUGHS] Johnny! [BREATHING HEAVILY] I'm not afraid anymore. Making it hard on yourself. Hey. I'll see you soon, Jamie.

The fucking bag. The money's in the bag. [STAMMERS] What bag? You stupid motherfucker. The money's in the bag. Did you check the bag, you stupid ass? The bag? What bag? The bag... I just...
