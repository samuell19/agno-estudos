Blaxploitation cinema Really offered something that hadn't existed before They got into areas that other movies didn't but crime novels did If there were more than five blacks on a corner They considered it a riot so they'd bring out the dogs And they'd turn the water hoses on, all this stuff was still happening in the 70s, man And if you fought back you went straight to jail The only way we could get away with it was on the screen The fear was that black powers might have to come from the barrel of a gun this is... Baadaasss... Cinema like a black hollywood My first exposure to blaxploitation films Downtown L.A, in that whole Broadway area with all the old theaters and everything that was like a black Hollywood Now all those big theaters up and down the street Every film was a Blaxploitation film They had a big thing there with "Hitman" with a picture of Bernie Casey on it And "The Mack" you know, a picture of Max Julien on the marquee I felt like I was in a black world every theater was a Blaxploitation film It's like going to this theater and Everybody is talking through it and they're making fun of it buddy. They're like, oh suck my dick... Fuck you motherfucker. All right, all this shit is going on to me I've never been to the theater This was going on before - ma'am how old am I? I'm in third grade okay, maybe less and um, like wow, this is really kind of cool and then Black gun started and then everyone shut up Blaxploitation - 1. a commercial - minded film of the seventies for black audiences It just meant that they found a way to Tap into a black audience and we exploit the dollars that they have by making movies for them by them that are about them It didn't mean that they were exploiting our sensibilities or anything else it was just trying to make a dollar in the mid 70s the early 70s when whites and when mainstream cinema was about defeat Its the Nixon era it was Watergate people didn't feel empowered Feminism was making men to have to rethink the relationship to romance and sexuality on screen black movies and heroes one people that could affect change they were funny they were people but these actors who are Bursting with charisma and ambition laying claim to the screen for the first time They were not affected by the kind of defeatist attitude That had taken this place in pop culture. They were about winning. My son Tupac was greatly influenced By the films of the of the seventies he actually by the time he died had amassed a collection of all of those films he watched them as a kid and he watched 'em over and over again what he watched As a kid was these films and Bruce Lee's films and all of the martial arts films and that was his basic culture It's just kind of what happens with time... Kill Niggers Stop now, why are you having integrity of a race of people? We needed something to make us feel better about ourselves you watch the news every day people were being beat down things weren't progressing the way we wanted to Martin Luther King was asking us to do one thing Stokely Carmichael and Rap Brown asking us to do another thing. The Panthers are doing their thing. Revolution has come Its time to pick up the guns! I believe that the Black Power movement influenced every single aspect of culture in the 60s and the 70s It's odd that people don't realize it now It's just kind of what happens with time but I think that there is no question that that is so We're gonna walk on this racist power structure and we're gonna say to the whole damn government Stick them up motherfucker. This is a hold up we come for what's ours? a lot of those movies were made because of the... I don't want to say power of the Black Power movement cause we actually had we had perceived power. We had no real power, but whatever Concept of power it was I think that we had enough to apply pressure he got away! The two films that really marked the takeoff of blaxploitation "Our sweet sweetback's badass song" by Melvin Van Peebles and "Shaft" by Gordon Parks The Van Peeble's film really pointed out The whole formula for making a success in Hollywood in defining this new short cycle You know the way I got into films I Just got I had a grudge growing and growing and going against what I kept seeing on the screen and I said well Shit, I can do better than that The cause that I had was... Giving Black folkes a sense of self which had been stolen from us. So that's how I made sweet back You got a sweet Sweet Sweetback The color intelligencia were not too happy about it, and The The Nationalists were not too happy about it Now you see the Panthers now the Panthers stood up for the film and made it required viewing for all of their members Then Peebles defined it as a revolutionary movie and the Black Panther Party Backed that position and so the debate was on was Sweetback truly Revolutionary or was it just purely? exploitation It's an X rated movie and It had depictions of sexual activity that at the time those were quite provocative and bold And That's why people went Very few people actually picked up on the political message in Sweet Sweet Back, and there is a very strong one Okay, what should I make him a clerk? Hmm musician Mm-hmm. What's something everybody's interested in without poontang? Shit... Everybody's interested in sex. So I said, okay. I'll make him a sexual animal That's how it came about, what Van Peebles really love to do He's an instigator, which is I think what a lot of again a lot of artists great artists want to do especially in this country is to just provoke people and it was Obviously purely from a commercial impulse to get as many, you know, Afros in the theaters seemed really possible There is no sense of the word conventional narrative And in fact there seems to have no interest in that, it's just always offhanded stories Which I thought was one of the most revolutionary things I've ever seen in a movie Certainly, I think this wave ranks with Godard because if it broke down the expectations that black audiences had about movies Well, I go into the theater and the theaters packed And not a sound, you could have heard a rat pissing on cotton Its toward the end of the movie and Sweetback is out in the desert. I said now, there's an old black lady and she said Oh Lord, let him die Just don't let him kill him. Let him die out here on his own It was off her chart. that a negro, a colored, a black and african-american one of us would ever make it to the To the end of the movie, so we didn't make it to the end of the movie, huh? She knew he was gonna die, but she leads it more to white folks to kill him The thing about Sweetback is that he got away and that never happened in a movie before there's never been a movie where the police or Someone was running after a black man and the black man escaped Without the Black Power movement there would not that would not have been allowed when Sweetback Got away, It was a stunned silence and then the place exploded World Premier - Melvin Van Peebles' Sweet... It was the largest grossing independent film up to that time I think its importance is that it demonstrated that there was a black audience there and that you could make black films for that audience and not only Gather your audience and focus them in a certain kind of way and make money in the process without being totally trapped in the system he did it for the money and Academia and cultural criticism and all this stuff has come along afterwards to try to give this kind of deep and profound Spin to it and it doesn't it doesn't mean that it may not have deep and profound implications But let's face it The foundation of why this film was made and why it was a success was all about money What Hollywood did, they suppress the political message added caricature And Blaxploitation was born Action I didn't introduce myself to you, my name is John Shaft Freeze everything we always wanted to be Five out of six, Hollywood Blockbusters were failing right in that period at the end of the 60s, so They weren't making any money in the box office, a couple of big studios went into receivership So when they started to see These things in the black independent films that were really successful Hey, they put out their own product line that was good The Shaft was really made for a white cast But when they saw all of these things, of rising expectations of a new black audience This black energy about self-definition and the new black politics and they saw something that was immediately Exploitable they changed chef's to a black film The first time I saw it it was awesome He was ike everything we'd always wanted to be he was like cool he talked tough He looked great He was kind of fearless he was a hero He was already a neighborhood icon when he showed up in the movie, even though we didn't know him We knew him, you know, we felt him There are these moments that kind of signals the black audience that white people just sort of scratch their heads about "Hey Taxi!" The scene where at the start of the picture can't get a cab "What the hell is this?" You know white mother Sort of like there was this this underground code That's the black filmmakers and the actors brought their own experience It's a movies in a way that we had never seen before "listen snow white" "Me and you gonna tangle sooner or later," "why don't you stop playing with yourself Willie you ain't gonna do shit" That huge ripple that created half a splash onto the shores of popular culture at some point and just the idea of Shaft saving the studio that - -was literally pawning Judy Garland's ruby slippers for twenty thousand dollars to keep the doors open. It was just a wonderful thing It was a hit combination. It's kind of a black macho detective in New York City black girlfriends white girlfriends mediating between the mob and The police looking for a kidnapped gangsters daughter high adventure and Isaac Hayes with the score was well Hey, that was a high cultural moment the sequence we saw this morning Times Square and none of the Skyscrapers along 42nd Street over the marquees and when Shaft pops up out of that subway That's when they should really come on. That should be a driving savage beat, you know so that we right with him all the time Lets take it 1..2... Hollywood seemed to have missed the entire advent of rock and roll and soul music and then with the appearance of the Shaft theme Its as if Hollywood finally woke up to it many years later "Up Yours" "Get out of the way!" That theme song was so exciting to hear and still is exciting to hear that it and It came at the very beginning of the movie It's sort of kicked the movie sky high (Song) "Who's the black private dick That's a sex machine to all the chicks?" "Shaft!" "Damn right" If you're a fan of the genre the music is great, is fantastic as a filmmaker I'm semi-frustrated that it wasn't utilized better "You see this cat Shaft is a bad mother (Shut your mouth)" "Talking about Shaft" If I had the theme to shaft to open up my movie I'd open up my damn Mov... kung fu films have used the score to Shaft better than Shaft has In 1971 for sure blaxploitation was poised for a big takeoff and then after that boom the explosion happened Most of the Blaxploitation heroes were anti-heroes. They were you know pimps and drug dealers and guys coming home from the war who lived on the other side of the law Ex-gangbangers or whatever and they were gangsters, but they were all fighting against the man "The only game 'the man' left for us to play" Super Fly Superfly capitalized on the insights of both of Shaft and Sweetback It had an absolutely brilliant soundtrack by Curtis Mayfield but it also had the Transgressive bad hero in it. And that is a coke dealer named priest who was at the height of fashion But this guy also Fits into what black people call the life a kind of hustling, pimping, underworld and this is taken up when Carl Lee Eddie and Superfly tells Superfly Hey, so it's the only game the man is left for us to play. "Priest all I do sell coke" Hey, I don't do no violence. Dont mess with no fun Iisten don't argue with me I'm trying to give you a chance You don't get my money tonight I'm gonna put that younger Leo's out of whores role. Listen that my wife you're talking about So What? it was the first time that we looked at the issue of Drug sales and drug abuse and looked at the outside Influences that control those drugs you're gonna work for me until I tell you to quit You don't own me pig and no motherfucker tells me when I can split Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? It's a movie about a guy wants make a big dope score and and the soundtrack refutes every single thing in the movie I mean you couldn't ask for a better object lesson than Superfly which has a Performance by an actor, a brawling actor Ron O'Neill who was itching for a chance to be a movie star kind of savoir faire Tigerish grace that maybe want to be him at the same time everything that Curtis Mayfield is doing on that soundtrack It's all seduction as he's saying no and thunder to everything this movie is representing "Hey Priest" Look here, this is Priest Curtis Mayfield approached that movie as a chance to make a serious statement about that condition and He was able to do it in Superfly even though the film Ethically went in one direction and Mayfield went in the other Part of the problem with Blaxploitation has always been that they degraded the political needs of the black audience Black audience in the 70s was indeed a politically conscious audience but too often going to those movies you were encouraged to simply forget the politics and Indulge the pleasure of the sex the clothes the cars the drugs it was where the reaction against Blaxploitation started to really pick up Fight Blaxploitation in Pix The Hollywood Beverly Hills branch of the NAACP pretty much rigorously denouncing Superfly, Jesse Jackson A number of people coming out and saying "hey..." I don't know if this is exactly the direction we want to go in If you see Jim Brown or Carl Stokes on TV You can rather safely assume that they are not going to suffer any indignity on the television They feel a little freer and Maybe feel a little more powerful but they are not actually any more powerful because they have not turned Groove Into an organism. There were a number of people that reacted to the film And we can start to see then the seeds of a kind of a critical dialectical reversal Superfly is made by black people In the black ghetto like it is and taken out to the money affluent people We have to be very thoughtful Of what we do in say on film the stereotypes that we have are often what we perpetuated ourselves I broke them, but I also created some because everyone thought a black woman is a whoopie or a sister all the time No, that's not true. You know, we create a lot of that mess ourselves "When Foxy Brown comes to town All the Brothers gather around... Because she can really shake him down" "Foxy Lady" I thought it was like doing "Gone With the Wind", I was going for the Oscar You tell me what you want done and I'll do the hell out of it That's how I Approached everything in my life is just be the best "have no fear, Pam Grier is here" Pam Grier to me was like a superhero. I mean look at the body on this woman, I mean With the film "Coffy", "Sheba, Baby" Foxy Brown, you know She was basically a superhero almost like the ultimate girl. You didn't quite want a girl that was that tough But you didn't want a girl that was you know, that tall had a big fro You don't want your girlfriend actually be able to kick your ass "All right, everybody out" He says anything Coffy was my mom Foxy Brown was my aunt and they were women who were very demonstrative But yet had very feminine and know how to use sexuality "Hey you big man, why don't you turn out the light?" This is the end of your rotten life you motherfucking dope picture Women of the 70s had to do a lot of things because of the wars They did a lot of things that men were supposed to do if you didn't have a man at home You did it. So I also brought that into the film Coffy, Foxy Brown and Sheba were independent woman that did things because there wasn't a man around "My name is Coffy. LuBelle Coffy is my little sister" Her whole life is gone! She can never get it back, and you're living real good It ain't right, so go on and take the shot. - I can't. That'd kill me Maybe it will, maybe it won't. But if it do, you're gonna fly through the Pearly Gates with the biggest fuckin' smile St Peter's ever seen. The level of violence was pretty great in those films now even in Coffy and all this that she had razor blade stuck in her hair women grab by hand She's a wild animal You've got to have that girl Tonight I thought it was the The moment where we could really live out The freedoms won by the 50s 40s 50s and 60s political gains Where we could come out here and go to Beverly Hills and the doors are open for me to go to nightclubs and restaurants And be treated very equal when I remember, you know Walking with my mom in the south my little brother We would go shopping to bring food and things back home and the bus's city buses wouldn't stop to pick us up Because we were black Hundred and ten in the shade humidity bugs and they go right by us It could be up to ten miles. It's like walking from here to downtown, you know LA So from knowing what that was and to be able to really experience a freedom One in the 70s was was very different What is it you really want? Justice. -For whom, your brother? Why not? It could be your brother too Or your sister, or your children I want justice for all of them And I want justice for all the other people whose lives are bought and sold So that a few big shots can climb up on their backs and laugh at the law Sister, I think what you're asking for is revenge also, the the sexual movement was Raging through the streets, shorts were getting - you know - skirts were getting shorter, men's pants are getting tighter People were throwing underwear and bra out the window, you know type of thing. We had Woodstock. He loved your body naked peace and love So all of that was about who we were too - and you can see that in the film By 1975 the industry was rocking and then other actresses said, "you know, I think I'ma kick some butt too and make some money like Pam" So there were other actresses entering, from Tamara Dobson To Gloria Hindry 'Do those dishes or something' They're done It was just exploding It was fun, I mean it was fashion 'He's a Pusher' Blaxploitation films brought to The screen for the first time in many ways working class and poor black people's obsessions with style Jim for gentle party. Look I want you to meet somebody this here is... Mystique What people really remember basically is the clothes that the pimps wore, the hustlers, you know That was the stuff that really stood out The self-expression they wanted to be out there they wanted to shine put the light on me, you know flamboyant peacocks I can remember, you know going to see The Mac and Everybody wanted to be 'Goldie'. You know, he had this white monkey fur coat on, its like everybody emulated this This was the shift from the Self-sacrificing 'we' generation of the civil rights movement and its aftermath and the 'me' consumer generation that was starting to rise Energy that up until about 72', 73', was very militant starts to get displaced into a sartorial display, fashion The afro was out Guys, that were wearing berets and black leather jackets suddenly started showing up with big gold chains with coke spoons on them and crushed velvet With the big floppy hats it was bad It was you know, it was fun. I mean it was fashion You wanted to be like these people that you saw on the screen and that's what some people say a lot of the negativity came from I Told you before, okay, you got your game and I got mine Okay, I got ten in the finest hoes in the world working for me. I'm getting $100 a day from each one. Okay? Goldie get off my ass with a penny-ante pussies games The people with the funny hats and the noisemakers they've gone home early the party's over baby. It's dawn It's reality Oh My God we should show pimps to a white America, that this is who we are in our community they'll think we're all like this and that was the problem of storytelling because everyone will generalize one black man on TV and on the news all black people are like that, you know So that was a part of a lot of the dialogue and oh my god, you know, can we do other films? Yeah, but no one will come and see them, you know, so So you like the music you like the fashions you like the culture, you like this and you like that? Okay well, those are also the stereotypes too Somebody's a junkie. Somebody's a pimp has to be involved about crime has to be involved in the ghetto White cops are all evil so now put into a social fabric framework what all we are pimps all we are cops all we are detectives all we are are Pushers or bounty hunters or these kind of things. No, but at the same time, it's crime cinema So the only real argument coming from the other side is like, you know black shouldn't be doing crime films some black attractions I think frankly the white directors are gonna Step in and take over the bonanza black directors are Continually beaten over the head or doing what they call black film I was making old Warner Brothers gangster movies like Public Enemy and And Little Caesar and just putting black actors into it Larry Cohen's one of the underappreciated near geniuses of American film making A man, who is always socially and politically conscious And comes up with kind of lowdown, but ingenious ways of expressing political issues and problems After I had done a picture called "Bone' with Yaphet Kotto I was summoned to Sam Arkoff's office he said we want to make some black attractions You really know how to direct those black actors and I said, well Sam there's only one black actor in the picture, Yaphet Kotto and I agree he was good, but directing a black actor is no different than directing anybody else But I said as long as you're interested I have to have something in the trunk of the car you might like to read and And we ran down and got the treatment for "Black Caesar". Well, we weren't out of the office before we had a deal A man will grow up with nothing and clawed his way up to the top. He's trying to live in the white man's world Playing by the white man's rules and forgets his true identity know himself and is basically brought down by the fact that he doesn't know himself It's a classic tragic story "Jesus Christ!" Sauce look like it needed a little more meat "What the hell are you doing, who are you? there are a number of these action-adventure films which started to liberate the black image and and started to bring out this kind of Physical black macho this expression of black violence. We were tired of seeing the righteous black man and all of a sudden we had guys who were us Or guys who did the things we wanted those guys to do. We wanted the guys kill the man Don't talk to him don't think of some elaborate scheme. You know, I'm gonna leave you here and let the dogs eat you No! shoot him and get on with your life, you know and guys like Fred Williamson and Jim Brown And Ron O'Neal and all these guys did that stuff Jim Kelly Jim Brown Fred Williamson, all these black athletes were getting into action adventure and being black heroes my nickname when I played professional football was 'The Hammer' I wanted to do a black gangster movie and I wanted to be like Edward G Robinson and where you rob from the rich and give to the poor Casting is 75% of directing Fred was beautiful Let's face it he was gorgeous with Fred Williamson you could say he was the black Burt Reynolds I can walk down any street in any part of the city and any ghetto Wherever it's rough wherever it's tough. I walk by three or four guys man. And as I walk by they go that's 'The Hammer' man. Yeah, yeah he's a bad dude, man. Hammers bad I'm walking this way and the guys walking that way and it's Fred Williamson And just as I'm passed, I'm like, oh my god. That's the hammer and so I just say, 'are you Fred williamson?' he goes you got it Somebody to stand up and say hey when the smoke clears and the guns are all fired We're the ones left standing, you know, don't kill me and go have him - Stallone, avenge my death kill Stallone, let me avenge Stallone's death 'Who's there?' I came out to California just for a look around. I got an agent just like that he said 'Gloria I want you to come over to this set with me' They're looking for an actress. It was black Caesar I walked in they looked at me and Fred was standing on the side just observing and Larry started talking to me. He said look and they were in the middle of shooting. He said look How do you feel about nudity? First of all, I'm a bunny So nudity to me was not a big deal Since I have no problem with it as long as it's done with taste he said well the feature feature film calls for it so I left and next thing I knew the following day my Agency said I got the part I had it, I've had it up to here with pinching my ass And thinking I'm a prostitute. O baby please Sit down, you didn't play a couple of tunes for me. Now let's just sit down and play a couple of tunes What do you want to hear? - Doesn't matter, just make it loud Then James Brown was brought in They sent me the music James done a wonderful thing, he thought which was if the scene was three minutes long James wrote seven minutes of music for it if a scene was a minute and a half James wrote three minutes of music for it I said to Bobby who was his assistant. I got a two man scene. He wrote four minutes of music He says to me, well the man gave you more than you need. I said Charles it doesn't work that way the music has got to fit the scene Picture opened - it was a blockbuster 'Who the hell are you?' - Did you know that man's beard keeps on growing even after he's... dead? Then once you get through that vicarious thrill to see a black man Beat up a white man on the screen you go back and you face the same evil system that you faced before you went there We should always deal with the reality and not fantasy. I did not like that climate during that time these organizations fail to understand that the community was really in need of Their own heroes and black movies The NAACP and core they're the ones who created this terminology Black Exploitation, so that has to be clear on the record book It came from them and didn't come from the white press it came from them. I didn't like the term Especially during that time I went what is that? How dare you pigeonhole us? who was being exploited? All the black actors were getting paid. They had a job they were going to work The audience wasn't being exploited. They were getting to see things on their screen that they had longed for over the years So I don't really understand where this terminology fits The NAACP never tried to go out and Get enough money to make a movie that they wanted to see, you know, and that was always my beef You know, if you have a problem with this particular film then get some money and make the film you want us to see Genres come and go There are so many of these movies, I mean there was the Black Six and the Black Gestapo and Black Shampoo and Blackenstein and Count Chocula, well, that's a cereal but it might as well been a blaxploitation movie I curse you with my name You shall be.... Blacula Blacula Dracula's soul brother Deadlier even than he You know you give strange... They made a lot of bad movies under the guise of Blaxploitation pictures just like most movies are bad But I think that they abused the privilege Genres come and go and the Blaxploitation genre Had a... I think had was so popular for so long and they made so many movies of it It had a firmer hold then say the biker films alright, or Slasher movies or something like that. It wasn't just connected to exploitation when the critics started to really turn against blaxploitation and, and just the the formula that was produced after the few brilliant moments It all started to head in these interesting directions Kung-fu was one of those directions Black people read it just as an anti colonial impulse just straight-up vs. martial art like that has been perfected and practiced by Asians and you run around kicking and whipping a lot of people with this Great skill so they were into that from the beginning There was something very 70s about those kung-fu films that it's a different 70s, but blacks made it their own by their acceptance of that genre You crazy I had done at least six or seven films back to back from 72 to 74 that was exhausting When I look back on that period you can see a lot of us working a whole lot we were all very tired If anything I got... I got opposition From people insane and you know putting me down for doing movies like that. I mean, I I was I was beaten Mentally, emotionally not physically because you don't know what's going on All you know is that there's a force out there That's doing you in and you're going under and you don't know why all you know is just spinning It wasn't white Hollywood so much that was against it they were very happy to make these films $700,000/800,000 budget 10 million dollar gross back to them Hey, they were very happy then all of a sudden here comes this terminology black exploitation Then they say well listen if the black audiences and the blacks don't like these movies Maybe we better jump off the bandwagon when Hollywood saw that like clearly One-fourth to one-third of their audience for the Exorcist and The Godfather was black They just all looked at each other and said hey, why are we making black movies? It was a vicious time when everything was cut off and you don't know it's cut off Until you start falling and you're putting your hands out You can't grab a hold of anything and I was grabbing Making phone calls and grabing while I was falling and I couldn't get a hold of anything there was nothing I saw our demise, I saw our death I saw the actors producers production companies, directors etc. I saw us dead Black films saved Hollywood and when they got through with us around 75 or 76 They dropped us, the door slammed Not very many people survived... Pam Grier survived Richard Roundtree made $13,000 for shaft as a film that made tens of millions of dollars we're not dead yet!... It's only been in the last six years That all these actors who were associated those movies that can actually talk proudly about them They always had to kind of like almost apologize for them because they took such heat I wanted to give all the actors their chance again to show how good we all look that we do have a marketplace that we're not dead yet I had three rules in Hollywood that they didn't want to adhere to One: you can't kill me Two: I have to win all my fights and Three: I get the girl at the end of the movie if I want her So they would not adhere to these three rules So fine, I could make my own movie and I damn sure these three things gonna happen in my movie I said to my wife. Well, this is never gonna happen You know, he's never going to get four million dollars to make this picture So I'll be happy to tell him I'm doing it because I'm never gonna have to do it I went to Cannes, I went to MIFED, and I saw two point eight million dollars in advance sales Brought the contract back to a bank Loan the money put my two million dollars on the table or Ryan mastered two million and we made Original Gangsters Starring Me, Jim Brown, Pam Grier, Richard Roundtree, Ron O'neal You lookin good my man Never felt better Sure feels good All those rebels back together again, but damn who's gonna go first We all are All right, let's go I filmed it very well and from that the actors got noticed they went on to work again 'What?' Jackie Brown that sounds like pam grier You had the chance, unemployed now, to walk away with a half million dollars Would you take it? When I first read the book and I thought about doing it I just started thinking about well, what actresses would be good to play this she's gotta be in her mid 40s She's got to look really good and she's gonna look like maybe she's in her mid to late 30s But awesome. I also wanted you to look like a woman who's lived a life And there is a really good aspect in casting older actors You know they got as many stories and they've had as many ups and downs as circus performers or Cops or this or any other kind of wild weather beaten profession and she had to look like she could handle anything And then once I put all those things together like well, that's sounds like Pam Grier How you doing Mrs. Jackie? - come on in I don't know if I was the right one, but he thought I was so I knew I had to live up to His image or what he thought of A woman who was survivor you want to see some motherfucking silly if I have to tell you to shut up one more time I'm gonna shut you up. I just came over here to talk to you - to talk? The way I see, you and me got one motherfucking thing to talk about, one thing And that's what you are willing to do for me I think that that's one of the the more meaningful images resisting images of a black female that's come out of contemporary film and it's important that Resisting image begins with Coffy It doesn't begin in the Quentin Tarantino imagination He has the capacity and ability through love I think through love of the image itself to love of this character, to take that image of the strong and powerful woman and bring it into a new generation, a new time in a sense He erases the earlier pornography of Coffy. 'Come On! Crawl over here... Crawl Nigger! You want me to crawl Right motherfucker! she's not gonna be Coffy. She's gonna be more like a real woman. Alright, she's gonna have more problems she ain't gonna just be able to take a shotgun and drive through the wall Whip a derringer out of her afro, super bad And shoot the evil white woman, all right 'Why don't you kill me too?' That is too easy for you bitch, so I did miss those elements a lot of the political issues that Were the foundation of those characters and films in those times Have been resolved and aren't as necessary and the politicalness of Jackie Brown I think we all loved Jackie Brown Cause Jackie Brown was the bomb! she was brilliant, she was gutsy And she was gorgeous you know But she wasn't, she didn't think that the most important thing in her life was her looks 'How you doin? - Fine 'Yes you are' Damn I bet you come in here on Saturday night you need Nigger Repellent to keep them off your ass I do okay - bullshit Jackie? You're one fine motherfucker. I bet you do a damn sight better than okay Tarantino took the swagger of blaxploitation without the political context niggers used the word carelessly in those pictures and it becomes Sort of unmoored from the kind of political context and I think there's a danger in that people think we just say it and it doesn't mean anything Or its just this aping Tarantino It's much more than that. I think maybe much more dangerous than that the whole controversy about Jackie Brown and the number times the word nigger was used in the movie was like it was kind of like how silly is that as a controversy his overuse of the word and I quote nigger is interesting. I mean even when you look at the blaxploitation films of that period the the word wasn't Really that overused or popular. It was used in a kind of a familiar affectionate sense, but it wasn't nostalgiasized and rarified in quite the same way Yeah, my nigga! my dialogue It's not poetry but it's close. It's not rap music, but it's close It's not song writing, but it's close, you know, it is what it is, but it's it's related to all those 'I don't know what to say, thank you thank you' 'Who was there for your ass? - You were Got damn, right? That's how that shit works you get you ass in trouble. I get your ass out That's my motherfucking job, and I don't mind telling you nigger, it's steady work My character is you know larger than life and he does have an interesting way of dressing he does have an interesting hairstyle and he does have an interesting way of carrying himself and speaking so it becomes a Blaxploitation movie in that respect. I think it's just a homage to the 70s and Everybody who had the courage to step out and take platforms and Just be heard hey, what is home is what is that? You can buy that for 25 cents somewhere man and uh and then after you know, They say see me laying on the street on the curb Right and they step over me and I was like Fred Wilson man. Yeah, I used to be him and they keep moving right? Is that homage? Okay, what is that good for? black hollywood yeah....right! On the shoulders of Fred Williamson Jim Brown Jim Kelly The Paula Kellys, Rosalind Cash, Vonetta McGee, Tamara Dobson, Markie Bays The Ruby Dees, Dorothy Dandridge, Lena Horne's, Eartha Kitt Dinah Washington, shall I go on? These kids stand today. It's a whole legacy there Blaxploitation didn't really make that much money for black people All right. It was a great cultural moment. A lot of good music a lot of good films were made But in terms of production itself and getting a foot in the Hollywood industry This was only a moment or an inner loop It came it died it went before it really had a chance to grow Where could we be today, we might be in another level Even today if that community was still alive Black Hollywood yeah right... sure in somebody's mind maybe but it don't exist man. No, no
