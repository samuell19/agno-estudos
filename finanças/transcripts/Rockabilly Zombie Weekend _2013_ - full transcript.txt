[tropical music from radio] Ooh, whoa. [turns volume up] Mr. Koty. My associate, Mr. Koty. The West Nile virus outbreak has the governor very concerned. [foreign accent] I've developed an all-natural plant-based acid that I test in my home country, and I believe it will do the job. With all due respect, Mr. Koty, governor's office wants this repellent tested immediately. We don't have time for plant nonsense. We need to spray these designated areas as quickly as possible. There's a lot of farmers in this country. Is there any research on the side effects? This is the research. Look, Mr. Koty, we're willing to pay you time and a half. It's quite simple. Mix the powder with the water. That will activate the repellent. Are we done here? Shitty job. Should have listened to my mother and take that teaching job. [speaking foreign language] Shit. [woman] I've got the dress. I've got the boots that will help me with the couch. And then for the wedding night I have something black and sheer with black high heels. What do you think? [woman #2] Well, what's under it? Never thought. Don't worry about that. It's all right. This is okay for tonight? This dress is really good. Do you like it really? Mm-hm. Are you sure? Mm-hm. Do you think Grant will like it? I think he'll love it. [sighs] I feel so good in this dress. Your boobs are good in everything. Yeah, they're going to hit the ground when they get old. Probably. Hey, bitch. [woman reporter] The following counties should be on alert for heavy mosquito activity for the next two days. Collins, Martin, Jonesboro. People living in these counties are advised to stay indoors. Oh. Every year. It figures tonight. Listen, Grant loves you for all that you are. Boobs to the ground or not. You're lucky. I always get the shitty guys. Not always. Most of the time. Most of the time. Oh, turn that up. That's Jeff's special in Kill in Moonshine. Yes. [loud music] Are you ready? [laughing] Turn that shit off. It's loud. It isn't loud. I don't give a fuck. Turn it off. Where's mom? Ah. Your mama? Well, I guess she's giving some guy a handjob down at the back of the bar. [laughing] No, you don't know nothing about that, do you, Micca? Get out of my room, Bo. Get out. This is my fucking house. You two bitches get out. Fine. Yeah. Dick. Don't forget your dress. I won't. You got your boots? Yeah. Well, move and we can leave. Ah, you got to be tender and not to ask if it's over a 15-gallon right now. [rock 'n roll music] Need a hand, buddy? Oh, fuck, man. How did he show? Hey, fuck you, man. Give me a hand with this really quick. Where? Right here. Right here? Yeah. So, when's LFA getting you to set up? Sound check is in like half hour. I got to go take a leak. Tom. Nature's toilet bro. All right, I'll be back. What the hell is Bo's trouble? Well, since the accident, he drinks all the fucking time. Oh, and he's a fucking pervert, too. Why doesn't your mom just leave him? She'll never leave. I think she likes the abuse. I'm so fucking sick of living this way. Fuck you! Are you okay? I'm fine. Dammit. Fuck me. Shit. Can you check it? Yeah, I got it. [cell phone ringing] Thank God that you called, baby. Some fucking crotch rocket just cut me off and the car stalled. Yeah, yeah, she's on it. Mm-hm. Yeah. He says to check the coil. No shit. Yeah, she's got it. Mm-hm. Yeah, I love you, too. Fucking mosquitoes. Where is everyone? It's like 4:00 and there's usually traffic. Yeah, he says if it doesn't work-- Try to start it. Okay. All right, I got to go. I got to go. Okay, I love you. [engine starts] [screams] Get in. We need to carry beer to Jesus. Hey, ma, I got to eat and head out to the party. I know. So, what time is this thing? Like right now. Okay, so I have leftover Chinese or leftover Greek. Chinese. So, you, um, planning on knocking up the girlfriend after you make her an honest woman? Look, we've talked about this before. I don't want to have this conversation again. You know what? She's lucky to have you. You're smart, you got a good job. Look, I know you don't really approve of her. Look, you know that I think she's no good for you. That she is pure trash. I know you don't like her, and you have made that very clear. I'm sorry. I love her. That's what matters. Yeah? Her mother gives handjobs at the back of the bar for money. You think the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree? She is not like that. Becky has had a tough life living with Patty. I mean, if anything, she's been more of like a mother in that house. Yeah, well, you know, she may not be like Patty now, but you just give her a few years. The addiction issues are genetic. Ha, and she'll probably get as big as a house. Is that what you want? You're such a bitch. What? I love you. Get out. Yeah. Get out of here. [country music] [clears throat] Dude, dude. Dude, what? It's some fucked up shit going on this woods. Wait, wait, let me guess. Tall man, had a mask, chainsaw. [laughs] No, some-- This raccoon with its fucking guts ripped out. Quick fucking around. We got shit to do. Look, I want to finish this. Go over there and help the chicks set the tables. Come on, bro, go. Get out of here. Okay. There's nothing over there. [man] Two more of those and I'll be the man. [laughter] Hello, Loretta. Hello, Shifty. Look at those weekend boys. Ah, all right. It takes all kinds. I don't like them, fucking posers. Well, that money is as green as yours. True that. Hey, can I get a water, please? Tap water smells like hate, boys. Just give us a beer. Hey, Shifty, do you think I could go home early so I could go to my kid's wedding? Well, work the hour. We'll see if Sheila comes in. Goddammit, you know I hate it when you leave early. That bitch, she never shows up. She won't show. [murmurs] [no audible dialog] [bike engine revving] Hey, that's Pete's new ride. Pete. Hermano. How are you doing, buddy? Hey, Shifty, how are you doing? Patty, come over here. I want to talk to you. Give me a minute. I've got customers. They can wait. I want to talk to you now.

Okay. If there's anything else before-- What the fuck? Mosquito. I just heard a music fest was shut down thanks to West Nile virus. So, awesome. I didn't hear about that. Hey, what's up? Come over here and see it for yourself. Ladies and gentlemen, redneck at its finest. Hey. Hey. Hello, bride. Sorry. Hey, baby. Thanks for doing this for us. You're very, very welcome. [cell phone ringing] So, Micca, I must say you're looking very lovely these days. I've been on a no-boy diet. I feel great. Ooh. So, J, let's say that's a very lovely dress you're wearing. Oh, my, you do that top justice. Don't even go there, honey. I just did. You need to get to your girlfriend. What's wrong, baby? Shifty won't let her off work. Let me talk to Shifty. Thank you.

She ain't feeling real good after the surgery and all the stuff. Yeah, I mean, I wish she could be here at the wedding and stuff. But, uh, you guys have been like parents to me. I understand, you know. Yeah. You just make sure you give her a call when you all come back from Vegas. Of curse. I'm going to send her pictures. Okay, um, I'm going to go change in the barn. Don't bring that spider to the wedding. I'll see you later. Love you, darling. [knock on door] Go away. (Patty) Can I leave? Is Sheila here? No. Fuck. Close the bar. Get everybody out. I don't feel good. You ate that bran shit again? Go away. All right. Shifty says we're closing, so drink on up and get out. I got to get to my kid's wedding. I'm not leaving. Call Sheila, tell her to get down here and get this party started. Come on, drink up. Get on that, guys. Come on. Hey. Hey. [whispering] Oh, God. [groaning] [coughing] [groaning] Patty. Patty. Patty?

'Cause I'm trying to get my mom on the phone. Okay. Um, I'll go entertain the troops, but first of all, who's this lovely young lady we have right here? Uh, I'm Layla, Grant's older sister. All right, if you'll pardon me, I have some business to attend to. Uh, could you escort me to the adult beverages? Oh, I think I'd be crazy not to. [laughs] (Layla) What a gentleman.

Ain't that the truth. You got to keep the peace at the home front. Cheers to that. Cheers to that. [horn honks] What the fuck? Are you fucking kidding me? Here, today? There's fucking animals out there. What the fuck are you talking about? Look, you're high. Get your shit together, and put this away. This means a lot to Becky. Mom, what the fuck is going on?

[whispers] Okay. Okay. How do I look? Step back a little. Okay. What? Don't freak out. A spider. [shouts] Oh, my God. [laughter] It's huge. It's kind of cute. It's not cute. Oh, okay, am I ready? Perfect. Are you sure? Okay. Okay, let's go. [grunts] Stop looking at it. He won't do you any harm. [grunts] Ladies and gentlemen, we are gathered here tonight to celebrate the union of our friends Grant and Becky. Their love transcends all obstacles and all boundaries. And tonight, we shall unite them under the stars with friends and family present. Grant, please approach. [cheering and applause] I want to start out by saying thank you to everyone here who helped make tonight possible. Here's to you. [cheering and applause] Now, let's all drink a toast to my beautiful bride-to-be, Becky. [cheering and applause] Now, I've known Grant for about ten years, and I was lucky enough to be there the very first night he laid his eyes on the beautiful Becky. [gunshots] What was that? He once told me he felt like they were made from the same mold. [gunshots] (Becky) What's fucking wrong with him? Did he snort those rocks? Everybody, give him some air. (Layla) He's contaminated. Don't touch him. Just go, go, go get some help. Okay, okay. Go, go. Becky, go with the girls to get help and get some help. Go. Oh, my God, this is crazy. The party is over, Grant. We're going home.

What the hell is going on? They're trying to kill us. Who? They look like-like zombies. Okay, look, I know how crazy that sounds, but everyone out there saw what I saw. Quiet. I just heard something. [screaming] They're going to get in here any fucking second. We got to get out of here. The police substation. Will you go there? You really think we're all going to make that? I don't think we have a choice. I'll go. I'm-I'm pretty fast. You got to take me with you. You got to stay here. No. Give me the gun. [grunting] Okay, ready? On two. One, two.

So, you've seen them? Yeah, I've seen them. Zombies, man. These fucking zombies. Just tell me, do you work here? No. No, man. What's wrong? I-I don't know. My stomach is just hurting. Do you need help. What do you want to do? I just got here about an hour ago from Collins County. Sheriff's department, they're shutting down the roads in and out, man. It's like a lock down over there. I think I need to just go to the bathroom. Do you think that's such a good idea? Yeah. Just figure this out. Wait, wait. Fuck. We were just up in Martin a few hours ago. Our friends, they've fucking turned into those things. I'm sorry, man. It sucks. What's with the tape? I saw this dude on TV. Some so called expert. He's telling everybody to get inside. He said that between the bug spray and mosquito bites, he said that's... perhaps was causing these people turn into these monsters. [groaning] Micca went to the bathroom. I don't think she should go alone. I'm going to go with her, okay? (Grant) Yeah, yeah. Here, take this with you. Is there any place that's safe? I don't know, lady. You got weapons? Oh, yeah. I'm good, I'm good. I'm taking these out as far west as I can go. I suggest the same thing, man. [Micca shouting] [groaning] West. You want to come with us? [screaming] I don't think so. Oh, my God. Micca. Oh, my God. Come on, Becky. (Becky) What happened? What happened? (Grant) Tommy, we've got to go. [crying] Oh, my God. Shit. That gunshot was basically a dinner bell for these monsters out here. I'm getting out of here. I suggest you guys do the same. (Grant) Tommy, we should leave. Come on. Don't-Don't look. Tommy, let's go. Come on. Come on. Grant, I don't understand what happened. What's going on? I don't know. She was my best friend. [whispering] It's all right. You can't do anything. (Becky) Oh, my God. If there's nobody here, where the hell is everyone? We need more guns. Shifty's got some at the bar. She's-She's right. We should go. Yeah. Okay. This what we've got to work with right now. We should go. [grunting] Oh, my God. [women shouting] [shouting] Go, go. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Get in the car. Get in the car. [screaming] [all shouting] Hey, Ginger. Hey, Ginger, you okay? I don't think she's doing too good. I think she's in shock. Gonna have to get to the hospital. Hey, Tommy, you got that extra shirt? Put this on. Come on. There. We've got to get some guns before we take her. Well, if that's all we got to do, then that's all we got to do. [birds screeching] (Patty) Oh, my God. Sheila? Oh. Do you see anymore of them? Well, he doesn't seem to mind us as long as he's eating her. We have to sneak in. We have no weapons. Patty, where does Shifty keep the guns? Patty. Patty. Get a hold of your fucking self. We need to get those damn guns or we're all going to die. They're in Shifty's office, in the cabinet by the desk. Hey, Tommy and I are going to run in. We'll grab everything we can. Get in the driver's seat. Get ready to haul ass as soon as we get out here. I'm coming with you. You have to stay here with Ginger. No. I'll stay with Ginger. and keep an eye on the ladies. Uh, got a shovel and a cane, so let's get going. You ready? Yeah. [Shifty grunting] Ugh. Oh, shit everywhere.

Lock the door. They're coming after us. There's got to be 50 of them. Okay. Tommy, Becky, get the ammo. All right, let's go. Are you okay? There's only two ways in. There's the front and the side door. You slide the cylinder. The bullets go in there. You're good to go. I don't know how the hell we're going to get out of here alive. We got enough fire power here. I think Shifty must've been in some sort of firing club. Who fucking cares? Let's get the hell out of here. If we can get to the police station, we can find out what's going on. [Ginger screaming] Oh, my God. We had to leave the little girl out there. She started to turn. Ginger? (Grant) Are you sure? Yeah, like the rest of them. Where are the zombies coming from? East side of the building. Truck is right outside the side door. Ten feet away? We can make that. [zombies grunting] Yeah. I say we, uh, we bust the side door, just haul ass to the truck.

My daughter had to drive. Yeah. My daughter had to drive. Yeah. Shit, we're out of gas. Bo will come for us. What the fuck are we supposed to do? Hey, said he'll come for us. Just be quiet. Turn off the lights, and help me get these guns ready. We'll kill as many as these pieces of shit as we can, Bo. Yeah. Oh, my God, look at that. Yeah, I see them. They're pretty old. We can pick them off easy, right? Yeah. Oh, shit, there's more of them. Oh, my God. Shit. Is there something in the road up ahead? Keep going. Fuck, I don't have a signal. Hey, just lie down real low. Grab the gun in your hand. Get ready to shoot. Shit. Where the fuck are they, Bo? Baby, are we going to make this? I don't know.

You got shot? Stay in the vehicle. Do not make any sudden moves. Keep your hand where we can see them. (Grant) What the fuck do they think they're going to do? I'm staying with my pals, son. You go ahead. Do you hear me? [no audible dialog] Sir, go ahead and step out of the vehicle, please. Step over to the side. We'll get you up to the BAS, all right? Yeah. Go ahead. Go with that man. It's okay. You first, sir. Lady, stay. Sir, you come with me. You got shot? She's my wife. She should come with me. Okay, go ahead, go ahead. Let her go. Come on. Ma, I love you. Ma. Yeah, I love you. (Bo) Go, go. Go, darling. Go. I want it back to back. [doctor] Sir, please keep your hands where we can see them. I got them, I got them. Guys, give them some space. Sir, just keep your hands where we can see them, please. [shouting] [whispering] I don't know who you are. I-I don't know what you are. [siren blaring] Step back. But I know them boys are fixing this. Are you okay? It's my wife. Where is she? They took her. Where? She's just over there somewhere. Help me. [soldier] Do not pass, lady. [mixed voices] We had a... chopper. We were ready to go. And then they took her. I'm sorry. I can't leave here. [mixed voices] [coughing] Step back. Step back. That's far enough. You two, back. Now. All the planes are full. No, what? No, no, you can't-- You can't just leave us here. That's my orders, sir. All the planes are full. Shoot me if you're going to shoot me. Back off. I can't leave here. Yeah. You understand, don't you? Yeah. I understand. We'll leave you here. That chopper is still ready. You take it. I want you to just go. There's a trail that runs south around the airport. I want you to take it to the opposite side. There's a chopper there. There's a pilot. His name is Syd. You tell him my situation. And you just go. He's at the end of the grassy runway. Yeah, we should go. Yeah, we should go. [mixed voices] Get back. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Well. That ain't going to happen. We got to get to Ma and Bo. We go to get out of here, but they can't see us. What do we do? I want to- I want to see my wife. Step back, sir, or I will fire. Step back, sir. [gunshot] Ma! Ma! [no audible dialog] I loved you. I loved you. (Becky) Come on. Come on. It's up there. Whoa, hey, whoa, whoa, it's okay. Who are you? Your boss told us that you'd be here. He's not going to leave his wife. He said we could go with you. What happened to Mrs. Singleton? I-I think she was infected. She was turning. They took her away. There are zombies everywhere. I think there might have been some following us. We need to get in that chopper right now and get the hell out of here. Okay, come on. I got him. You go to the front. (Becky) Okay, thank you. Strap up. [pilot taking on radio] It's okay, it's okay. Everything is going to be all right. It's okay, it's okay. Everything is going to be all right.
