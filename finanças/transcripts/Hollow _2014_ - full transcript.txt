Thank you all for joining us here today to honor Mr. Huy Vuong, for donating $50,000 to help expand our temple. I'd like to present him with a token of our appreciation. I would also like to welcome our newest member, Mrs. Diep Vuong. Message from KIEN Why don't you answer my calls? What's wrong, honey? My shoe is too loose. Mom, why are there so many dolls here? Not dolls, honey. They are figurines for the ritual. Mom? Can I borrow one to play? No, honey. They're for the offering. Down! Are you this late for school too?? I'm sorry. Why aren't you in uniform? I got promoted. How is the ceremony? The Shaman just gave your father a present. He's not my father. His smile creeps me out. Children often think ill of their stepparents, but you're wrong. Listen. No one gets to choose their family. But under the same roof, we must respect one another. Understand? Yes. Have you decided yet? You can't go in a temple dressed like that. Is the spirit inside her yet? Big Chi! Little Chi! Don't disturb the ceremony. Sit down. Sister! What's this? Chi ...."can"? "Big" Chi. "Big” Chi? I have one for you, too! Here. “Little Chi"? That's right. Very good! From here on, we're officially twins. Deal? Selfie time! Mom, I need to pee. Chi, take your sister to he toilet. Yes, mom. Mom can I stay outside to play? Everything in here is flammable. This is serious. Stop joking. Why do't you answer my calls? What did you decide? Stop calling me. Look at what I caught! That's disgusting! Put it down! Go back inside! Ai... Put it down Go inside. What's this? Lucky money. Chi! Mom! Chi! Chi! Mom... Is the ceremony after the offering? That's right. Where's your sister? I told her to go back inside with you. Where's Ai? I don't know where she went. Ai! Where's Ai? The water. our baby is in the water! Ai! Ai! Mom.. You! - Why didn't you look after her?! - Sister! - Sister. - Help! Dive under! - Ai! - Calm down, sister. Worthless! You worthless girl! Ai! - Go! You're useless! - Calm down, sister. Calm down! Master, master... 1 Week Later Place it here. You and Huy will light the bridge to start ceremony, so that Ai's soul can find her way home. Huy refuses to believe that she is dead. Then you should pray on his behalf. A funeral without a corpse. Interesting. Tell your men to keep searching. Better yet, you go. You're always down there. It's been a week. If you don't believe, then you can come with me. Each one of us mourns a loss in his own way. I Just hope that this crocus can help you with yours. It's been a while since you last invited me. If you feel the need, just come visit me. Sure, real estate is profitable, but it's not as fun. Beautiful. Diep's daughter? Looks just like her mother. Thanks a lot. Call me if you have any news. Almost forgot. Your crocus... Place an egg at the base of it, then pray for what you want. And then... If you ever get bored, you know where to find me. Sir, you can come in now. CHAU DOC HOSPITAL Vinh? You called me about the body of a little girl who drowned. "little Chi"? Her name is Ai. How does she look? Better after I pulled the snails off her face. Go ahead. When I first saw her, I had to have a few, too. And I see dead bodies everyday. Smoke It. I've quit for 6 years. Ready? Have you told her parents? I Wanted to be sure first. - Where was she found? - That's what I don't understand. She washed up on the banks of Hau Giang, near Chau Doc. Upstream from Ca Dau. Gently. She's still resting. Ai... She's sweating... Is it a fever? - Has she seen a doctor? - Yes, but you should know that... Her clothes are so dirty. Take her upstairs. Let's get her cleaned up. Hurry. Hurry! Let's get her out of these dirty clothes. - Mom ... - Mom is here. These are her first words since I picked her up. Picked her up from where? Who found her? Since when? Please, no more questions. Let her rest. Let's go. We are so grateful to you. Is there anything else? The doctor prescribed this for her. It's a fever reducer. Thanks, again. Chi... Chi... Ch... . Chi... Ch... Chi... What's wrong? Nothing, mom. I just wanted to check on her. Why is your forehead so wet? I just washed my face. Mom. How old were you when you had me? Nineteen. Why did you ask? After you had me, why didn't you want another child? We were still too young then. Your father was following his dreams to be an engineer. And you? What did you want to be? A flight attendant. Really? I Wanted to see the world. So then... did I ruin your dreams? No. What's wrong, sweetie? Can I sleep here tonight, mom? I was just about to call you. And how is your flower? What kind of freaky plant is this? I hear your daughter is back home. Wasn't that what you prayed for? Why did you call? Just wanted to congratulate you. Oh... Almost forgot. Your flower needs to be taken care of each day, if you don't want to lose your good fortune. I Don't know what game you're... Oh, I'm sorry Mrs. Nhung. Like this. Don't you remember? Look here, Ai. Like this. Look! Chi! Don't yell at your sister. Hand me another pot, honey. Mom. Isn't it strange? Only yesterday we were going to bury Ai in this spot? I think flowers are more appropriate. Don't you? Sister... Come here! Hurry. Go play with your sister, honey. Yes, mom. Look at that. A duck. Silly. That's a chicken. chicken. Do you want to play with the chicken? Mom! What's wrong? So itchy! It hurts! Stop! Mom! What's happening? - It's itchy! - Let me see. There, there. Mommy's here, now. It hurts! Chi, go get the first aid kit! Let mommy see, honey. Be brave for me. We're gonna lay down now. It hurts! Don't move, sweety. Hold on. Chi! Hold her steady. Lift the apron. It hurts... Mommy's here. Hold on for mommy. - So itchy... - Easy there. - It's alright, now. - Itchy... Did you forget something else? You need to remember to feed an egg everyday. If... You don't want to lose your good fortune. You're a funny guy. I don't need your plant to make money. Who said anything about money? Do not neglect your flower. "Abortions" Have you decided? I've tested it 3 times since yesterday. So...what do you plan to do? I'm such an idiot. Chi... Chi... I'm sorry. Chi. Yes? I want to talk with you about something. Is something the matter? What book are you reading? English proficiency... I have to pass an exam in order to study abroad. How come I didn't know about this decision? Like you, I want to see the world, too. Can you travel in your condition? What is that, dad? Just daddy's work. You sell rocks? I Collect them. Collect them. What for? Because they are precious stones. Wanna see? Pretty. You want to help daddy break this rock? Sit here. What do you plan to do? What does it matter? Why does everyone keep asking me? Why not? Who's the boy? Does he plan to marry you? Fine. We'll keep you in the house until the baby is born. I Don't want people to gossip. Soiling your stepfather's good reputation. His good reputation. What about me? You? Your stepfather is the one who provides for us, sends you to a good school. He sent me away from home... You're the foolish one. You ruin everything. - You brought shame to this family! - I'm sorry. I'm a disappointment to you, to your husband, - to your new family, - Chi! We have enough problems with Ai. I Didn't need you to add more trouble. Very good! Stop. That's not edible. But it looks like candy. No. These are crystals. If you take a bite, you'll break your teeth. How did the crystals get inside the rock? You see how the rock is hollow? When it was forming, there was gas inside. When the gas disappears, the rock becomes hollow, like this. So does this mean every rock has crystals inside? No. Only if the rock is hollow. And only if water gets inside of it. So then will my stomach get crystals if I drink too much water? Your stomach is not hollow. And I am also not a rock. That's right. It's late now. Time for bed, sweetie. Ai! Does it hurt? No. - Honey! - What's happened? Why is there so much blood? Did she hurt herself again? - Mom! - Mommy's here. Mother? Mother! Mother... Is she having her period? She's only six years old! She's shaking all over! Are you cold, honey? Honey... you are so cold. Shaman... Phone... Shouldn't we take her to a doctor? Master, I need your help! Ai's spirit is under attack! Can you come here please? Yes. Yes. We can bring her to see you now. We're leaving now! Huy! Help me! Grab her feet! Something is spreading them! Hold them together! Hold on... Huy! Who will return to Phu Tho with me? What's wrong with our daughter? That's not our daughter. Please take her to Shaman Linh. She needs to see the shaman now. Who will return to Phu Tho with me? Let's go. Close the door, honey. Drink! Look at me, demon! I command you to look at me! - Stop! - Quiet - Ai!... - Both of you sit! Mother, help me! Sit down! - You're hurting her! - Help me, daddy! If you want to help her, then SIT! Ai! Ai! It's over. It's all over now. Mommy's right here. Mommy's here. Has the spirit left her? I Couldn't exorcise it. Didn't we just see the spirit leave her? Ai is not possessed. I don't believe that was a ghost. It's not the spirit of a dead person that has taken her body, but the spirit of a living person that has wandered into Ai. In order to cast this lost soul, we will need to find that living person. How is this possible? Typically, a lost soul wanders into a blood relative. Has anyone in your family recently been in a coma or taken ill? If you are right, then how should we know where to find that person? Who do you ask? We ask the dead. Abortion Clinic The doctor is out. Come back in the morning. Ma'am Please, can I wait inside? What does the plant have to do with my daughter? Nothing. The plant is connected to you. It grants your wishes, but it demands and offering in return. The greater the wish, the bigger the offering you'll need to make. It's for my daughter. She's being haunted. In this case... You need to make a blood offering. Robbery, homicide, fire, what is it? Little brother, it's me. I need your help. Chi... she's run away from home. When did she take off? Little brother, Please find Chi for me. Don't worry. She couldn't have gone far. I'll find her for you. The truth is... I don't know what to do... First, Ai, and now Chi. What's wrong with Ai? It's a long story. Relax. The anesthetic should've kicked in by now. You'll feel a slight discomfort when I insert the vacuum aspirator. Oh. Always a blackout when you need it. No matter. We'll do it the old-fashioned way. 11 Missed Calls Meet me by the bridge - Uncle Thuc Who is the offering for? When your father was alive, This was our morning ritual. One iced coffee. Three cigarettes. He died of cancer. Where were you all night? Have you ever seen something so terrible that it blinds you to everything? From that moment on, you feel estranged to everyone. What happened to you, Chi? You can't run away from home just because you don't like your stepfather. I wish my father was here with me. I know that Huy loves my mom, but I can never accept him. From the day mother moved on, she treats me as if I was not her daughter. Then Ai was born. I felt I was someone again. I was her big sister. But the girl that you brought home, She's not Ai. I Don't know who she is, or how to help her. Do you know who you sound like? Your mom loves you very much. More than you imagine. I know that right now you find it hard to help anyone. Especially when you don't even know what you want yourself. You feel Ai is not your sister. But the fact that she came back is truly a miracle. What do you mean by miracle? I received news that she was dead when they found her body. But when I went to Chau Doc to identify the body, Your sister had come back from the dead. We have to go to Chau Doc. We have to find out what happened to Ai. You have to promise me. That you will go home. And make things right with your mom. Are you Vinh? Yes, I'm Vinh. My name is... "Big Chi"! Like that? Photo? No, thanks. Everyone thinks he drowned because he was too fat. Over here. But the truth is, fat people float easily. Did you sneak a shot? How is "Little Chi" doing? I Came to find out Ai's death. Locals call this island "The Eel". They think it's cursed. Why is that? Your sister was... Sneaking shots? Your sister's body was the third one found here. This girl is Huong. Only sixteen. Stabbed to death. This is Huong's mother. Quyen. The police tried to question her, But it turns out she's crazy. This woman was found the same day that your sister went missing. Jumped off a bridge. No ID. My sister has a scar just like this on her neck. Would you like to see her death record? I Need to speak with Huong's mother. What are you doing? - Swallow nest is good for Ai. - Why didn't you get the ready-made one? No. This is more nourishing. Please, please. This is better for Ai. Honey! Why? Why would you do that?... I'm sorry. Do you remember... the day our baby was born? The doctor said... that she might not live past a month. But then... the doctor was wrong. Ai is very strong. Just like her mother. I Promise you, no matter what happens, I will never give up on her. Go inside. Go on. Quyen, are you home? You have a guest. You know, she lost her mind after her daughter was stabbed. Her neighbors keep her fed with these. Normally, she is quite lucid. But if she starts to act up, then use this alarm. Ring it and the neighbors will come to help. Okay, stay here. I'm off. Quyen! You have a guest, Quyen! My baby is home. Come sit. Sit right here. You must be hungry. Stay right there. Sit still. Mom is going to get porridge for you. Here, eat. Eat, honey. No. You're not my daughter. Where's my daughter? What have you done with my Huong? Where's my daughter? I... Where's my daughter? Where's my daughter? What have you done to Huong? Where is she? Ma'am... Where's my daughter? What have you done to Huong? Talk! Please don't, ma'am. I Just want to talk. My little sister is in trouble. I Need your help. Huong. They have taken away my Huong. This is Huong's room. When Huong was 8, The Global Health Organization chose this village for their mission. They vaccinated all the children in the village. After that... My daughter started rescuing dolls from the river, and bringing them home. She pretended to vaccinate the dolls. I See... A spark in your eyes... very similar to my Huong. Miss Quyen, The tattoo on Huong's neck. Recently, a woman died nearby. She, too, had the same tattoo. Ma'am, do you know anything about her tattoo? Being a mother is a blessing. But... It is also the greatest pain of being a woman. Anyway... You can stay here for the night. I've lost both my daughters. Haven't I? No. Only when you give up. You haven't lost them. Just be here for them when they both return. Ma'am! Ma'am! Wake up! It's me. Leave me alone! It's me! - Get away from me! - Wake up, ma'am! It's me. It's me. Calm down. It's just a nightmare. Calm down. Please stop coming after me! I've already paid for my sins with the death of my daughter, Huong! Please stop coming after me! No one is coming after you. No one! No one is out to get you. Look at me. Stop! Please stop! I Promise! I Promise I will tell. I Will tell her everything! Leave me alone. I will tell... At the end of each mission, they gathered all the children and their families together for a group photo. Often... I've asked myself, If it were not for these photos, Would anyone know we exist? This is Tuyet. The one you asked about. This is Hang, Tuyet's daughter. Tuyet was abducted from a village in the North. Two brutes knocked her unconscious, then threw her in a car. At that time, Tuyet was only 14. The tattoo scar is the mark of their brothel. Tuyet ran away... when they forced her to go get an abortion. She ended up in this village, and gave birth to Hang here. Around here... many young women are abducted... and sold into prostitution. I lost my Huong in the same way. After Huong snuck back home, for months... she didn't say a word. When she noticed Tuyet's scar, it was like a thread that connected them. They became close as blood sisters. The three of them were in inseparable. They were looking for Huong, but when they saw Tuyet and Hang, they decided to take Hang. That was Tuyet's punishment for running away. Mom! Let her go! Run! Hang, run! Hide! Come here! Come out! Come out! Mom!... Mom! Mom! Honey! Honey... Tuyet... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Baby... It's all your fault! This wouldn't have happened to my qirl, if it wasn't for you! Why don't you kill yourself and settle your debts! Hang... Mom ... Who will return to Phu Tho with me? Chi Chi! Chi Chi... Ai! What are you doing? Get away from her! Who are you? Leave her alone! Ai... Help! - Help! - Diep! Mom's here. What are you doing? Mom! Mommy! Are you okay? - What's wrong with her? - Chi!! Chi! Why don't you just go kill yourself? Who are you? - Mom! - What's wrong with her? Diep! Mom... Mom! - Mommy! - You're mom is over here. Mommy... Please get up, mom. Hello... Mr. Muc. Money... May have helped you change your face. But the foul smell of your breath, I can never forget. What has happened to Diep? Is this the same spirit that possessed Ai? No. It's a different soul. Full of hate. Have you forgotten me? What was it that you said? "You can never forget..." "...your first time." Now that I have found you, I will kill everyone you love. I'm going to make you witness everything I was forced to witness. - Diep! - Mom! Diep! What's happening? Master, help me! Diep. Mom... Mommy loves you... Mommy... Mom! Mom! Don't go, please mommy... Mommy... Did you like that, Mr. Muc? Now I'm going to take your daughter's life. Just like they took my daughter! What are you doing? Saving my daughter's life. This lost soul... I know where to find this person. You will go with me to perform the exorcism. It's not that simple! Both bodies must be brought to the temple. Find another way. Please. It's okay, honey. Finally. You took the trouble to visit your old friend. Where is she? What do you mean? Tuyet's daughter. Where is she? Same old place. One hour. Kinky. What does it take for you to go faster? More money? Almost forgot. You're in my house. One hour. Mom! Mom! Mom, what's happened? I Said I'd come back. Huy! Ai! Anybody! Huy! Mom... Wake up, mom. Chi, you broke your promise. Your mom has been worried sick! My mom... My mom is dead. I'm too late. I'm sorry, mom. It's my fault. If only I had stayed in Saigon. Chi... Mom... don't leave me. Mom. Chi... Chi... I need to know what happened. Where are Huy and Ai? No one is home. Look around for any signs... Chi. Are you listening? Chi, go look around. Do you see anything? It hurts! They took Ai! Who took her? Do you remember the scar on Ai's neck? That is the mark of the brothel. Send the image to me. I Know this mark. Just wait at home. I Will bring Ai back to you. Beast! You're one of them. I want no part of this. You need to help If you want to save this girl. As long as her soul is stuck in Ai, she is as good as dead. Her name is Tuyet. This girl is only 14. Still fresh. Only VIP's like you get the first taste. Have fun. Mystical chanting Leave! Don't touch me! Let go of me! Leave! Leave! Leave now! Get out! Leave now, or drown in a sea of fire! Leave!

And this is my gift to you to remember me by. So you'll never forget your first time. Huy! Thuc! What happened here? That brute... Strangled the shaman. Why was she here? Ai... was possessed by this girl's soul. We came here to buy back her freedom, and perform the exorcism. But before we finished, he started attacking us. What do I do now? Take Ai home first. Can I take care of this girl, too? I always like to keep a souvenir to remember my girls by. Head down! In the car! In the car! Head down! Muc! Muc! Huy... You... ...must... ...save... ...Chi.

Haven't you figured it out? Who's there? Ai is dead. Don't you understand? Ai is already dead. No. The exorcism was a success. Ai is alive. No. The moment they found her body, she was already dead. That little girl behind you is Hang. She is Tuyet's daughter. What's wrong? Don't you recognize your own daughter? That was the reason... that Hang... chose Ai to take over. It is also the reason why Ai came back to life. But it was you... You exorcised Hang's soul from Ai. You are the one who killed Ai. No. I love my daughter more than life itself. How would you understand? The love of a father for his little girl. I Know... that my father loved me. But you... I know how you love little girls. Mr. Muc. Turn it off. Turn it off! Thirsty... Go honey... Go back inside Ai's body. What are you doing?! You're killing her! Dad doesn't want to kill her. He just wants her soul to go back inside you. Go honey...
