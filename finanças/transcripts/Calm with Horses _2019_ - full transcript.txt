[man] I'm told I was a violent child. Usually to myself. Whether it was knockin' my head against the wall or... mauling at my own fingers till they bled. Anyone who got in my way was fair game. I have this memory of someone holdin' me. Just holding me. Just fuckin' willing me to stop screaming. I don't know why I'm screaming. I can hurt people but there's no hate in any of it now. Don't go thinking all violence is the work of hateful men. Sometimes... it's just the way a fella makes sense of his world. [knocking] [electric window opening] [man 2] Arm? Get in there and hurt that uncivilised fuckin' animal. Is he going to make this awkward? [man 2] I don't think so. He knows it'll go easier if he takes it. You know, but he's still saying he didn't do anything. Sayin' he thought the bed was empty. He's in there now waiting for you. Look, I've locked his mammy in the bathroom so she won't cause any bother. How easy should I go? [man 2] Well, don't kill him. [laughs] [voice on TV] Who said, "To be sure, the dog is loyal. But why, on that account, should we take him as an example? He is loyal to man, not to other dogs". -Kevin? -[Kevin] Martin Luther King, Jr? [buzzer sounds] -[deep sigh] -[woman whimpering] [Presenter] Are you scared, Kevin? [Kevin] Ah, bring it on. Watch out, Kevin. You're in trouble now. How's things, Arm? I don't want to keep Mammy in there too long, now. Fair enough, so. -[glass shatters] -[grunts] [grunts] -[Arm] Up, Fannigan, look up. -[coughs] Look up. [woman shouting and whimpering] [TV presenter] Correct! [cheering and clapping on TV] -[door rattling] -[Fannigan coughing] [gasping] I didn't do anything! I didn't even touch her. All right. -[woman crying] -[door rattling] [Presenter] Well done yourself, Tom. You don't scare that much. You're the man of the match. [woman crying] [Presenter] Come over here now before someone gets hurt. Thank you to all our players tonight. [woman wailing] [man 2 laughing] My TV now. [Arm] Most people know to stay on the right side of the Devers family. I'm what you meet if you ever find yourself on the wrong side. But every now and then, you'll come across a fella who just doesn't know any better. [theme music playing] It wasn't always like this. I used to box. Dympna would rock up with his seven sisters to watch. Watched me get me eyelids ripped, the jaw broken... the nose broken. I never got knocked out. Dympna said, "If you come and work for me and me two uncles... you'll never suffer more than a scratch". I said, "Okay". He said, "You can come live with me as well, if you want". I said, "Okay". People say they're trouble, the Devers. But I say all families have their problems. This is my family... and this is how we deal with our problems. Last night, Dympna invited the whole crew round for drinks at the Devers family home. They were allowed to stay the night if they drank, snorted or smoked away the means to get home in one piece. Like they always had. Problem was, this time... Fannigan got completely pig-eyed drunk... and when everyone was sleeping... he wandered up to the bedroom of Dympna's younger sister... and tried to climb in under her sheets. Charlie was set to turn 14 this week. The Devers don't care about blood. They say it only makes you related. It was loyalty. Loyalty made you part of the family. [car tyres screeching] [car horn blowing] How do, Brando? You found a job yet? [Brandon] Grand. I'm the CEO of this feckin' couch. [Dympna] Well, we've had a sudden vacancy open up. You interested? No, I'm okay, man. Thanks, D. -Nice plasma, Arm. -[Arm] Thanks, Brandon. -There's the men. -[Dympna] Well, ladies. [chuckling] How's my little sis? -All right? -Get off. [Dympna] Well? [woman] What's with the plasma? I thought Charlie might like it. Well, aren't you the thoughtful one, Arm. I've already got a TV. Eh, say thank you. I don't want it. [Dympna] Okay, okay. [snorts] All right, I'm hungry. [Dympna] Arm, stick the TV in your room or get rid, yeah? [seagulls screaming] [knocking] [woman sighs] How are you, Mrs. Dory? Douglas. Ursula around is she? She is, of course. Ah, sure look it, I brought over a plasma. Who had to pay for that? -[laughs] -[woman 2] Mam! It's all right. Just let him in. I won't have this one bringing stolen goods into my house. Ah, fuck it. [Arm] How do? -[Ursula] Hiya, Douglas. -[Arm] How's my boy? [Ursula] He's well enough. What's with the plasma? [Arm] For Jack. He doesn't watch telly. [Ursula] Are you listening? He can't cope with it. [Arm] Ah, sure kids love TV. Stop that, you. [Arm] What's the craic, Jack? [groaning] Maybe he doesn't recognise you. Been a while. [imitating rocket engine] [Arm] Here. Go buy your mammy something nice. A fuckin' sense of humour. [Ursula] Be with you in a minute. [Arm] I was thinking I could take monkey boy to the park. Down to the park? [Ursula] You won't get him into his trousers. Ah, sure I'll take him like this. Don't think Jack'll be too bothered, will ya? I'm serious. Serious, I'll take mine off as well. -Yeah, bit of solidarity there. -[Ursula] Douglas, Jesus Christ! -[laughs] What are you at? -[Arm] There we are now. [Ursula] He's going to see the horses later so don't be gone too long. I thought you wanted me to get him out of your hair for a bit. Eh, actually no, that's... That's not why I asked you over. [Ursula] It's good news. Jack has been accepted into a new school. [Ursula] A special education place. Right. And there's going to be some costs involved so I just wanted to let you know. [sighing] [Ursula] And well, if you're able to contribute something, anything? You know, I hate asking 'cause if I could afford the fees myself, I wouldn't be fuckin' asking ya to begin with, but I can't so there you go. It's-- It's a fantastic place, really it is... perfect for Jack. What about the horses, though? Yeah, I mean, the horses help, sure, but... Excuse me, can I have that, please? But, eh... Can you put your fucking trousers back on when I'm trying to talk to ya? [Arm] I was the same at his age. A late developer. That's reassuring. I told you I don't want the telly. [Arm] It's for Jack. [dog barking on TV] Sharp as fuck. Would you turn it off? -[wailing] -[Ursula] It's all right. Would you fucking turn it off, please? -[Arm] I'm fucking-- I fuck. -Jack, it's all right, please. If I take the plug out with the disc in it, -it fucks up the drive. -Fucking take it-- I don't give a shit. Turn it off. -Fuck. -[Jack screaming] [Ursula] Shhh, it's okay. -[Ursula] Make yourself useful. -I fuckin' turned it off! [Ursula] I know but open the door, please? -[Jack screeching] -[Ursula] It's okay. [Ursula] You're okay, Jack, you're okay. Shhh. -It's all right, Jack. -[screaming] The TV's off. The TV's off, Jack. Shhh. [theme music playing] [Jack howling] [howls] [howling] [Arm laughing] I'm comin' to get ya. [howling] [howling] [mobile vibrating] [howling] All right, Dympna? [Dympna] Where are you, big man? -I got a call from Hector. -[howling] Stop that! Stop that. Sorry, D. I said I got a call from Hector. You know, he sounded mad but wouldn't say why. I think Mammy told him about Fannigan. We need to swing by and see him. Where you at? I'm with the young lad now. I asked where you at? The park. Over on Drummond Rise. All right, I'll see you in ten. Good man, Jack. [bass music playing on radio] -That one's Ursula's road. -Yeah. -We're not dropping Jack home? -No, no time for that. [mobile vibrating] Don't answer that, whatever you do. Don't answer that. [disconnect beep] She's after money. It's some special school for the young lad there, you know. So... look it, maybe it's something we can talk about at some point, you know. Arm, mark my words, listen to me when I say this, yeah? She will take you for a fuckin' ride if you let her. Personally, I care for you too much to see anyone, anyone take advantage of ya. She's a fucking fake, her. She knows how much you care about him. Just wise up, here. Wise up, Arm. -Wise up? -Yeah, wise up. [engine roaring] [barking and snarling] [Dympna] Fucking dogs. -[car door opens] -Leave the kid here, yeah? -[Jack moaning] -[Arm] You're all right. [Arm] Just stay here. Just play with something. I'm just going round the corner to talk to the nice man, now. [Dympna] Arm! Fucking hurry. You're late. [Hector] Let's make this quick. Maire's waiting for me. [Dympna] That widow of yours. She is one lucky lady. [laughs] We heard about this fella. [Hector] Eh? What's his name? [Dympna] Fannigan. -Mmm. -Fannigan. Yeah. What he did to the young one? Yeah, she's okay. Took care of it. Actually, it's taken care of. [grunts] Really? Well, I suppose that must be the reason you chose not to tell us. She's a child, Dympna. A child. If you couldn't handle it, you should have called us in. -It's fucking handled, okay? -Is it now? -Yeah. -I don't know about that at all. And Paudi certainly doesn't know about that, and as far as he's concerned, retribution hasn't even started. But I've convinced him to step back for a while. Give you a second chance. To do what? To amend yourself. [Hector] We understand the Arm here has given him a taste. But we think it's now time to finish the job. No, we don't do that. Not into that sort of business. You know what I'm sayin'? It's time to get into that business. If you know what I'm saying. The muscle? Young Armstrong. If what happened to that child, happened to your young fella outside... would you leave the matter as it is? This is my business. I'll fuckin' sort it, -you hear me? -Your father, God rest him, [shouting] would never have let it end there. He'd be ashamed to see what you're doing to the Devers name. Heh? He'd be embarrassed of you. [Hector] If you can't control your side, everything falls apart. And we're done. How much does Fannigan know about us, ha? About our end of the operation? [whispering] This is simpler than you think. Get that half-wit to do it. Sort this out, nephew. For all our sakes. Well, what do you think you're gonna fucking do? [grunts] What we shouldn't have to. Look what I found? [man] I think the little lad was getting scared out there by himself. All that screamin' and shoutin' going on. What you been up to now, ha? We took care of it. We're taking care of it, Paudi. We came in to investigate, didn't we? [moans] What's that? Ha? -[tense music playing] -What are you saying? [Paudi] I can't make head nor tail of what this fella's saying. What's he on about? Just, eh... quiet. Quiet? The quiet man. Just like his daddy. If you grow up to be big and strong like your daddy, maybe you can come and work for me. But be warned... if you step out of line, I'd have to come along and I'd have to-- I'd have to cut your little nose off. [laughs] And I'd have to come and cut off your little ear. [Paudi laughs] As long as you're a good boy, there's nothing to worry about. Yeah? Isn't that right, Dympna? Yeah. I'll have to be getting him back to his mother now... Mr. Devers. Come on, Jack. [tyres screeching] [indistinct conversation] -[engine roaring] -[horn beeping] [dogs barking] -[Ursula] Come over here. -Some fucking zoo, isn't it? [sighing] Where the hell have you been? I lost track of time, sorry. Don't you ever let him near that fucking drug peddler again, do ya hear me? -Drug peddler? -You take him where you say you're going to take him -and you answer my phone calls. -Right. Or on your head be it. I mean that. [Ursula] Come on then. [Ursula] Paula, would you mind him for one second, please? Come over here. Just fucking come up here and talk to me now. -What? -Come on. -Come up and fucking talk to me. -What about? We need to talk about the school. Not now, Urs. The school's in Rochestown. Where the fuck's Rochestown? Cork. Cork? Will they have horses in Cork too? No, they have better support for Jack. Let's be honest, now. This is all about you. [Dympna clicking tongue] -You're a fake. -What? You're a fake. [stammering] You know how much I care about the boy -and you're just trying-- -How fuckin' dare ya? If anything, this is about you. I don't want him to be around you... 'cause of the things that you do. I work. [scoffs] Fuck off. Beatin' up junkies until they shit themselves is not investment banking, Douglas. You were never like this before, you know that? Before them Devers got their hands on ya. And now, you're just their fucking lapdog. Look it, I'm not going to pay you to take my son away from me. -It's not fuckin' happening. -[man] Is there a problem here? Just came to see the horses. [man] You all right? ['Whiskey in the jar' playing] [Arm] I mean, she can't just take off... can she? [Arm] She can't just fuckin' steal the lad. [man] Steal him? Yeah, I don't know. Can she do that? Mmm. Have you considered the possibility of playing hard to get? -With my boy? -Yeah? Like, in Switzerland, right? They have this thing, right, where you're only allowed to own one goldfish at a time. You're not allowed to own multiple goldfishes. Just the one. It's the animals cruelty. And it's the same with the guinea pigs. What's that got to do with my son? Well, just consider yourself lucky you're not Sweden... ish, Switches... Yo, do you mind gettin' a drink, please? Thanks. -Go! -You're the man, Needles. -I've been wanting to talk-- -Just take your shot. -The Fannigan-- -Take your shot. [pool balls rattling] [Arm] It'll be all right. We'll sort somethin' out, Dympna. [balls striking] [indistinct chat] [laughing] I didn't get the joke, lads. What's so funny? I just-- I didn't hear it. What's so funny? [man 2] Dympna? What's the problem, man? [Dympna] No problem. [Arm] Fuck. Having a great time. Great time, bro. What'd you call me? Dympna? -Yeah. -[Dympna] Mmm. It's Mr. Devers to you, yeah? Actually, it's Mr. Devers to everyone, yeah? Mr. fuckin' Devers. [Dympna] The fuck you lookin' at? So, Mr. Devers, you're having a good time? Yeah. -[music builds] -[mumbles] [glass shatters] -[grunts] -[chuckling] [Dympna] Right? Look at that. [groans] Stop. Will ya fuckin' get up, like? Come on, big man. [Dympna laughs] Fuckin' get up! Fuckin'... [sound fades] [soft music playing] ['Whiskey in the jar' builds] [Needles] You're the one, Arm! -You're an animal. -That's my boy. I need you to find Fannigan. Can you find Fannigan for me? Find him and keep an eye on him all night, yeah? -Will you do that for me? -I'll do that. Will ya do me that favour? Arm, let's go. [clicks tongue] Come on, boy, eh? Yeah? Let's go now. Fuck the lot of ye, yeah? [Dympna] Hey, it's not like they were going to fuckin' call the Guards, is it? Like, even if they did, even if they did, what the fuck are the Guards going to do? Useless cunts. You know, if only the Gardaí would be a bit more Perry Mason with me, who knows? But... anyways... Here. [snorts] Yeah, all right? Which one was Perry Mason again? The lawyer fella in Los Angeles, what's the... Was he not the fella in the wheelchair? You're thinking of Ironside. -Ah... -Ah... I am, sure. Ah... What was his name? -Who, Ironside? -Yeah, Ironside. Ironside. Yeah, Ironside. That's the character's name, Ironside. -The main character. -Yes! [laughing] The fella-- The fella in the wheelchair? Yes! I don't know why the fuck you'd name a wheelchair-bound fella Ironside, but-- You're supposed to say, "wheelchair user" now. Fuck you and your wheelchair user. [laughing] [groans] Fuck them, anyways. The wheelchair-bound? No, fucking Hector and Paudi, Arm. -Wake up, here. Take it. -Fuck off. -Take the fuckin' thing. -No, I'm all right. Take the fuckin' thing now, will ya? -Come on. -Fuck. [snorts] That's it. Yeah, well he just won't let this fuckin' Fannigan thing go. They're not letting it go. Hector's one thing... Paudi's a different breed. Paudi is a different breed. Here we go. -Fuck off. No! -To the two bros. -No, I'm all right. -We're bros, ha? Come on, take it. Hey! [growling] Yay, there's a good boy, eh? -Ha? -[Arm chokes] You fuckin' prick. [techno music playing] -Urs? -Jesus Christ! You're not with Jack. Did you not see him? Wasn't he tethered to a lamp post outside? He's with me mam. Is that all right with you? -I suppose. -You suppose. Suppose you leave us alone, now? You're the horse fella. You could say that. This is Douglas. Jack's daddy. [man] Right. Well, Jack's a lovely kid. Ursula too, right? What's your name? Sorry. Rob. That's some fucking accent you have there, Rob. [Rob laughs] So, why aren't you at home, Rob? Well, part of my Masters involves work placements and that. -And you chose to come here? -[Rob] Not exactly. [chuckling] I was at a place in Cork for a while. Roches-- Rochestown. -Rochestown. -Rochestown. Yeah, Rochestown. [Rob] They have a great school there. Especially on the psychotherapy side. Well, I guess after a while, I needed a change. You know how it is. So, I put in a transfer request and, eh... [Rob's voice fades] they sent me here. [music fades] [voices fade] [music builds] And yourself, Douglas? What does a guy in his prime do around here? I'm retired. [Rob] Retired? Douglas used to box. -Hey. -Yeah, he was-- He was... great. He represented the county in amateur at one stage. That's fucking great, man. [Rob] How come you gave it up? I killed a fella. [Dympna] What's the craic, Ursula? [laughs] Who's this handsome cunt? Glad to see your business is going well. [Dympna] Yeah. Give Jack a hug for me, yeah? Bye, Rob. [Dympna] Bye, Rob. Jeez, you're a fucking mess. Will you come on? [Dympna] Sorry, lads, I think he's going to puke there, you know? Thanks. [slurring] What? What is it? What? [exhales] What? There's one thing left to do, buddy. We have to do it. We need to sort this tonight. If we leave it any longer... we're gone. Not Fannigan. Us. We're gone. [Dympna] Eh? -[Arm] I don't know, Dympna-- -[slapping] Eh? You know the money thing we were talking about? -What money? -For Jack! For Jack! Get him whatever you want. I'll get you whatever you want. Anything. You're my bro. You're my bro. I love you to bits, you know that. -[sighs] Yeah. -I fuckin' love you, -do you hear me? -My bro. -I fuckin' love ya. -[mumbles] Shhh. Fannigan's going to be in Margaret's till closing time. -[mumbles] -You follow him home, past the cliffs, ha? Past the cliffs... You make it look like he did it himself. You make it look like he did it himself, do you hear me? Eh? Now take one of these. Take one of these, ha? -[Arm mutters] -Take one of these. -[Arm] Please... -[Dympna] Come on. -One of these. Wake you up. -Yeah. [snorting] -[gasps] -[Dympna] Yeah? -[Arm mumbles] Give me that. -Okay? -Give me a minute. -[Dympna] Outside, eh? You're okay. [techno music builds] [music fades] -[soft piano playing] -[shivering] [humming] [footsteps] [Fannigan coughing] [Arm] Fannigan? Jesus, Arm. How's things? [grunts] [Arm] Turn round. [Fannigan groans] [Arm] Hector and Paudi found out what you did to young Charlie. I hope you knew they always would. You are not them, Arm. -Ha? -You are not them, Arm. All right, jacket. What do you want with my jacket? -Give me your fuckin' jacket. -What do you want with the jacket? Jesus, Arm. Ah, no. Fuckin' hell, no. Give me your jacket. -Take off the boots. -What? Take off the shoes. Ha? Dympna said this'd be the end of it. Take off your shoes. And the rest of the clothes. -Billy, fuckin' come on. -Is this happenin'? [nervous laugh] Ah, no, Arm. Ah, Jesus, are you doin' this, Billy? -Oh, my God. -Trousers. Come on. [cries] Oh, my fucking God. [waves crashing] Hold on, no, no, no! I'm in the fucking nip! No, no, no! The joke's gone too far, now. I'm not puttin' up with this. No, I'm fuckin' outta here. It's nearly over now. It's nearly over. [sobs] Douglas? Douglas? This isn't you. Please. [sobs] Please. Please. [menacing music builds] [music fades] Did anyone see ya? -[Arm] No. -No one? Are you sure? He's definitely dead? I was careful. What did it feel like? Just ignore me. I'm just-- Ignore me. It's... [Dympna groans] You need to lay low. Don't speak to anyone for a few days. Anyone. Don't go anywhere. I'll take care of Hector and Paudi. [engine starts] [Fannigan] Douglas? -[Fannigan] This isn't you. -[Arm] It's nearly over now. [Fannigan sobs] Please. -[Arm] It's nearly over. -[Fannigan] Please. [Fannigan sobs] [moaning] [Arm] You're to leave tonight, Billy. You leave now, you never come back. [Fannigan] I never will. Thank you, Arm. You won't regret this, honest to God. No popping into the mammy's for the boys. You leave now and you never-- [Arm] You never fucking come back. [Fannigan] I won't, I swear. Thank you so much, Arm. [indistinct TV chatter] [Dympna] Everything good, yeah? Yeah. Yeah, grand. Any chance I could borrow the car? [Arm] Goin' a bit mad up there in the room. Where are ya goin'? Ah, just clear the head, you know? [Dympna] Remember what I said, yeah? Yeah. Thanks a million. -[door closes] -[kids song on TV] [horse blowing] [Rob] You're a natural. [Ursula] Very good. [Rob] There you go. You got it. [Rob] Just like that. [Rob] You good? [crows cawing] [Rob] That's it. Stay relaxed. [Rob] Yes, that's it. Well done. Well, hello again. So what is it you're after now? I wanted to see Jack ridin' a horse. Yeah. There you go. [sighs] -[Rob] Come on. -[Ursula] Hiya. You disappeared off last night. Ha? [grunts] You were doin' grand without me. [Rob] Come on. Let's go. [Ursula] Well done, Jack. Hiya. -[Ursula] That was very good. -Great. -[Ursula] You were very good. -[Rob] Session finished a while ago, Douglas. I've got a retirement group coming in now. Well, I am retired, right? Do you want to touch her? Do you mind? Go for it. It's easy. -[whinnying] -Come on. -Yeah? -Yeah, go for it. There you go. [Arm grunts] Why don't you have a go? I'm all right. Rob will look after you. Yeah, if you want. [Ursula] Go on. Bet you're just as good as any of the kids. Go on, show Jack. [Arm] Ah, fuck it. There you go. Look. -[block scraping] -[Arm exhales] -Just stand on the block. -Right, yeah? -[Rob] Grab hold of the mane. -Fuck. It twitched. -The mane? -[Rob] Yeah. -Throw your leg over. -[Arm] Won't hurt it? -Not at all. -[Arm] The horse? [Rob] No. Go for it. -There you go. -Fuck. -[Arm] All right. I'm up. -[Rob] Good girl. [giggling] Jack! [chuckles] -[Rob] You all right? -You know, I think so. Not so sure about my nuts though. -All right. -[Rob] There you go. -[whinnying] -[Arm] Shit! [Rob] Whoa, whoa. [Arm] Oh, fuck. -Let's go for a walk. -What the fuck do I do now? [Arm] Holy shit and fuck. [Arm] I can hold the hair? -[Rob] Yeah. -[Arm] Yeah? [Rob] Yeah, she won't mind. [Rob] Yeah, it's pretty easy. -[Jack giggles] -[Rob] It's like ridin' a bike, but without a bike. [Arm] A fuckin' hairy bike. [Rob] Whoa, whoa, whoa. [Arm] What do you mean, whoa? What? [Rob] You want to take the reins? -[Arm] Reins? -[Rob] Yeah. Here. Jack! -[Ursula and Jack chuckling] -[Rob] Come on, let's go. [Rob] Right rein. There you go. We're gonna go straight down here. Look at your daft daddy. [theme music playing] -[waitress] Here. -Thanks. Go on. So, are you planning any more unscheduled visits? Didn't think there'd be any harm to it. [Arm] Good boy. That's just Jack's version of eating a burger. Would you pass the red sauce? Don't be smiling like that neither. So? How are the plans coming along for the big move? Eh, actually I'm heading down there for the day tomorrow. I've got an interview for a job at the school. Classroom assistant. Unlikely I'll fuckin' get it, now, to be honest, 'cause... but... if I did, it would, eh, cover the lion's share of his fees. [exhales] Hear that, Jack? You'll have to call your mammy, "Miss Dory". [Jack moans] [moans] I know you will. You do realise, though, I'm-- I am thinking about what's best for him in all this. [grunts] [Ursula] But no, you're right, I am thinking of myself a bit too. I fuckin' hate it here. The looks I get-- -The whispers. -What do you mean? People... thinkin' that I'm somehow to blame for the way Jack is. I know them Devers women say it. Ah, come on. You can't really blame them, can you, Urs? What does that mean? Well, in a town like this, there's nothing else to do. Do you really think I would have smoked or fuckin' snorted or did whatever when I was pregnant with our son? No, I meant gossip. -Right. -There's nothing for them to do -but gossip. -Okay. So, you need someone to look after Jack tomorrow? I... Yeah, I suppose but I'm going to leave him with my mam. Don't leave him with that downcast cow. -Douglas? -You know, they say dogs take on the traits of their owners and Jack's smarter than any pup, so... Just imagine what a miserable fecker he'll grow into if you keep leaving him with that pinch-faced... yoke. You know, you-- [chuckles] You only ever see her that way 'cause you make her that way with your... presence. -My presence? -Yes. Never been told I have presence before. You're so stupid, you know that? Look, let me take Jack tomorrow. I'll take him the whole day. Just him and me. No Dympna, no Devers, no.. No nonsense, right? [Ursula] I don't know. [sighs] I don't think you could cope. -It's not that simple. -Let me show ya. Jack loves it here. [Arm] Don't ya? He still loves it here. Let me show you what I can... I can take care of him. I'm tryin', Urs. Won't be like last time. What would you do? Ah, we'll find some sort of trouble to get into. -Won't we, Jack? -[giggles] [Ursula laughs] That's what I'm afraid of. All right, fine, would you just-- Just keep an eye on him, will ya? [Ursula] And be patient. Yeah, I will do. [laughs] [laughs] You remind me of yourself sometimes, you know that? -[Ursula] I miss you. -[gulps] You know all this stuff with the Devers, right? That's not you. Hearing that a lot lately. [theme music playing softly] ['A town like Malice' playing] [girl] Come on, hey. Tell us about your new woman. Is it true about her money? [girl] Her Ballinbracken toy boy. Ha? -[girls laughing] -Fuck that. [girl] Hector, the gold digger? -Now, you... -[girls laughing] -[girl] Oh, is it a secret? -Are you tellin' her? [Dympna] I'm tellin' ya, Hector's new widow, she's got a rake of cash, man. A rake of cash. How much is a fucking rake of cash, like? I don't fuckin' know. A rake of cash's a rake of cash, Needles, fuck sake, man. So, you don't know how much exactly -the mad widow woman has got? -No, I don't fucking know how much exactly but it's enough for good old Heck to do away with his self-respect, you know? Spruce himself up beyond recognition. [whispering] I mean, that's how much we're talkin' here. It's a lot. Recognition. -I understand. -Do you know what I'm sayin'? I know what you're sayin'. All right. Okay. [inhales] So, em... we'll just, em... What do we do? What do we do? All right. All right, listen to me. This is what we're gonna do. -[Dympna] Mmm. -Okay, so... -We'll follow him... -[Dympna] Mmm. ...out to Ballinbracken. We'll take her cash. We'll just take her cash. Ah, and then... Mexico. [stammering] Mexico? Yeah, well, you have to plan a getaway, D, 'cause-- Because you got Hector on your tail, now. -You've got Paudi on your tail. -Why the fuck Mexico though? [Needles] Yeah, but it's a cliche and a cliche is a cliche for a reason. You don't go to fuckin' Mexico though when you're escaping from Ireland. Do you know? You don't-- I mean, the Yank fugitives do it because of the border, you know, it's only over the border, but like, that's why- That's why they do it. But for us, it's fuckin'-- It's flights, and... fuckin' visas and accommodation and fuckin' stopovers in... What's it-- Fuckin' Atlanta and stuff. Atlanta? So, stopovers. [stammering] So, where would you go then? I wouldn't go to Mexico. Yeah, but where would you go then? -[Dympna exhales] -Eh, Brazil? Rochestown. Ha? Rochestown. [Dympna] Where the fuck is Rochestown? Cork. [Dympna] Cork? Cork. Yeah, Cork. -It's in Cork. -Yeah. It is in Cork. [sniffs] I mean, makes more sense than fuckin' Mexico. -Mexico-- -To be fair. It does make more sense, to be fair. -Makes more sense. -[cheering and clapping] Yeah, now, salutations and cead mile fuckin' failte to ye all. -[all] Hey. -To me family. Whom I love so much. [Hector] And to friends. I see Dympna has brought a fair few fiendish-lookin' -skins with him here today. -[all laugh] Always been a good judge of character, our Dympna, ha? Forget about the boys, Heck, what about us bures? [Hector] Oh, no, the bures too. We couldn't do nothing without the boys, and we couldn't do nothin' without the bures neither. [girl] Fuckin' right. Charlie? Will ya join me up here, please? No. [nervous laugh] Come on, girl. Come on. Go on, sweetheart, your uncle's waiting for ya. [Hector] Good girl. [laughs] It's all right. We Devers, have been through some tough times and we've the scars to prove it. But we're out the other side now, yeah? And we're here now, celebrating young Charlie's birthday. So, I say, 'Fuck 'em all!" And let's tear the absolute arse out of it. Slainte! [all] Slainte. [snorting] [Hector] Hoo... [sniffs] Ah. -[Dympna] It's good, huh? -[laughs] I fuckin' love the pair of ye, eh? Yeah. Good lads. [Hector] You're loyal skins. That's what you are, fuckin'... [Hector sighs] You did the right thing, young Armstrong. Shhh, the fuck's sake. You did right by your family. [Hector] Tell me, now. Must have taken a lot to do what you did, ha? I know. I know. Still... it had to be done, ha? We welcomed that man into our home. Like took him in, treated him as part of the family. We let that disgusting piece of shit across the Devers threshold and what did he do? Now, we trusted him, what did he do? [sighs] Paudi thinks you let Fannigan off the hook. What do you mean? Paudi is of the opinion that that man should have undergone a fair amount of pain and sufferin'. He suspects that you were... perhaps a little too merciful in your methods. He wants to see you. Hear it from the horse's mouth as it were. He needs to have his mind put at ease. [tense music playing] But that's just fuckin' Paudi, right? [Dympna laughs] [laughs] [fairground music playing] [children shrieking] What do you want? -This is Jack. -Hiya. -[Jack grunts] -That's my boy. -One candy floss, please. -Okay. [children laughing] Hey, let's play a game. -[Arm] Can you say it? -[moans] Candy floss. [Arm] Jack? Candy floss. A couple of words. Then you can go back to being normal again, I promise. Promise. Fair play to ya. Fuckin' take it. -[woman] Hello. -How are ya? -Want to have a go? -Yes, please. -All right, three euros, please. -Three euros. [woman] Thank you. -Shootin' a couple of targets. -All right, so. [woman] Now, all right? [Arm] Jack? Jack, look. Look what's-- Will we try and win something? All right. -[shot] -That was shite. Thanks. I missed. I'll do it again. We've got three of these, right? -[woman] Now. -Thanks very much. [Arm] Right, watch this now. [shot] [woman] Okay. There you go. -Your barrel's crooked. -[woman] Sure, you'd say that. -[Arm chuckles] -[woman] Good boy. [Arm] This one's for the young lad. -Your turn now, Jack. -[Jack moans] Ah, come on, Jack. Come on, now. -[Arm laughs] -[Jack moaning] Come on. -[Jack moaning] -Come on, it's fun. [Arm] Grab it. Ah, come on, Jack. -[Arm] Jack? -[moaning] Hold it. Give me your hand. Gimme your hand now. Put your other hand around here. That's it. [woman] You have to hurry up, now-- Just give me a fuckin-- Sorry. The lad, he hasn't eaten. Come on. [Arm] I don't need this today, Jack. We're havin' fun. Jack? What's wrong with ya? [Arm] What's wrong with ya? Shut up. -Stop it. -[crying] -What? Stop it. Shut up. -[crying] Shut up, now. -Stop it. Shut up! -[screaming] Shhh. -Shhh. -[screaming] Jack, for fuck's sake, now. Shut the fuck up. Just be fuckin' normal. All right? [screaming] [man] Control your kid, will ya? [shouting] Fuck yourself! [grunts] [crunch] Fucking shit. [doorbell ringing] [Jack screaming] Jack! [Mrs. Dory] Shhh. [Mrs. Dory] Jesus, Douglas, what happened? -[screaming] -[Mrs. Dory] Shhh. It's all right. Douglas? [yelling] Douglas! Douglas, what's the matter with you? You know what you said the other day, Dympna, about the money? After Fannigan was done? Really? Now? You want to talk about that now? We don't have time for it. Come on. Let's go. -I need that money. -[zipping bag] I'm not followin' here. I don't feel up to it today, Dympna. Sorry? Maybe we could leave it for today? No, no, no, there's no leavin' it. We've to go to the farm today, yeah? Paudi's waitin' for us. And if you don't wise up, you'll get fuck all. Grab the fuckin' bag. Grab the bag. All right? -[knocking] -[Ursula] Douglas? [scoffs] [knocking continues] -[banging] -[Ursula] Douglas? [Ursula] Douglas? Douglas-- Douglas, what the fuck happened? You can't be around here now, Urs. You just left Jack. -What did you do to him? -It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter? Look, I'll tell you everything, right, [stammering] but not here, eh? You have to go. -I'm not goin' anywhere. -Ursula, please. I'm going to make this right. I'm going to make it all right. -So... -[door opens] I can't do it now. -Stop walking away from me. -[Dympna] Let's go, big man. There's no fuckin' time for this. [muttering] Fuckin'... Douglas, I know something's goin' on with ya and every part of me said not to come runnin' after you but here I am. [Ursula] Okay, I'm listening. -Just talk to me. -[Dympna] Arm. Urs, go home. This is not loyalty. It's servitude. -I told you to fuck off, you! -Dympna! [door opens] Fuck. Ah, go on then. -Go on. -[Dympna] Let's go. Go traipsing off with this lot, like you always do. I'd watch that plank in your eye if I were you. [Ursula] What's it go to do with you, June? [June] I won't have you reproaching poor Arm here for a minor lapse of judgement, when sure isn't it your fault the child is the way he is in the first place? You've said what you wanted. Had your little tantrum. Why don't you fuck off home, sweetheart? -[Dympna] Let's go, big man. -[banging car door] -[Dympna] Come on. -This isn't your family. [Dympna] Fuck's sake, Arm, come on. Get the fuck in the car. -[Dympna] Fuckin' hell. -[sniffs] [engine starting] [tense music playing] [thunder] [dog barking] [door opens] [Dympna] Uncle Paudi. That's a fine cunt of a day, eh? Sit down. [chairs scraping] Hector tell ya about the dog? Dog? Dog. Eh... One of them's ate a wasp. It's a habit they've had since they were pups, you know? Think he must have ate one that wasn't dead. His tongue's all fucked up and he's wheezing and stuck lying down since yesterday. Be a shame to put such a loyal animal out of action, you know? Sure, as the good Lord himself would say, "That's fuckin' that". Well, fuck that goon Hector. Can't believe he didn't tell you about the dog. [Dympna mumbles] All that man cares about is his little bit of stuff stuck away there in Ballinbracken. -Still out there, is he? -Jesus Christ, I think his brain's turned to shite. -[laughs] -He has this unconscionable stack of sprays and perfumes. Bathin' himself every second day. [laughing] He has... -He has his little clippers... -[Dympna] Mmm-hmm. [wheezing laugh] -...for his toe-toes. -[Dympna chuckling] [wheezing] A clipper for his toe-toes. Can you believe that? [Paudi coughing] He forgets to feed the fuckin' dogs. [inhales] So, this business about the molester... -You mean Fannigan? -Fannigan. Another loyal skin no doubt, hmm? We're fallin' fuckin' down with loyal skins, ha? Didn't Hector tell ya? [Dympna] Dealt with. Dealt with? [Dympna] Arm took care of Fannigan. He's dead, Mr. Devers. Dead? [Arm] Fannigan won't bother no one no more. [Paudi grunts] Well, you took your fuckin' time, ha? [Paudi] Better late than never I suppose, ha? Sure, maybe a seasoned killer like yourself, you might be able to help me with the pup, ha? [Paudi] Help him on his way? [grunts] Come on, the pair of yis. Grab that scatter gun in the corner will you, nephew? [Dympna] Pretty wound up, isn't he? [Paudi] That's the other fella. He's in a bad way what with his brother being fucked up, you know? That gun loaded, Dympna? -Aye. -[barking] Give it here to me so. [Paudi] Right so. Shut up, you! Ah, the puppy, ha? The poor little puppy. Gonna put you out of your fuckin' misery. -I'm gonna put you down. -[drops falling] Poor puppy-- Shut up, you! Put the poor little puppy down, ha? Gonna put you out of your misery. [tense music builds] [thunder rumbling] [mouths] Fuck. [whining] [gunshot] Oh, Paudi, what the fuck? Get in here, the pair of yis, ha? -Whoa, fuck, no! -The pair of yis, -do ya hear me? In here now. -No! [Dympna] Okay, Paudi, what the fuck? That's it, now. Just st-- You'd choose a child-molestin' fuck over your own flesh and blood, ha? [Dympna] Fuck it, you told me you took care of it. You told me you fuckin' took care of it. -Sorry, D. -Shut the fuck up, you. -Shut the fuck up. -I couldn't do it. -Shut the fuck up! -Arm took care of nothin', and you took care of nothin'. Too busy down the hairdressers gettin' the blondie colour put in your hair. No one took care of nothin' only me. 'Cause I'm the only one. The only one -who cares about this family. -He fuckin' told me he took care of it. You fuckin' lied! You fuckin' lied to me. I lied. -I lied to him. -I'll do it next time. You know I would have taken care of it. [stammers] I'll do it. I'll take care of it next time. Just put the gun down. Please. [uncocking gun] [exhales] Oh, boy. -I'm sorry, D. -[Dympna] Shut the fuck up. -[Dympna] Fuck off. -I couldn't do it. [Dympna mumbles] Fuck you. [Paudi] Here. Take care of it now, why don't ya, ha? [Dympna exhales] [Paudi] Finish the job now, like a good boy, ha? Make your daddy proud. [mutters] Fuck you. -[Arm] What are you doin'? -Ah, for fuck's sake. Shut the fuck up. -I couldn't do it, D. -[Dympna] Shhh. Shut the fuck up. -What are you doing? -[cocking gun] [Dympna] Ya fuckin' lied. -I know you-- -Shut the fuck up! -A child molesting fuck. -Yeah. [Paudi] Interfering with one of our own children. And you let the hired help here leave him off down the road laughin' with his cock in his hand, is that it? Fuckin' did. I-- [Paudi] This is family business, Dympna. Family business and that's down to you. That's down to you. The Arm here, pullin' the wool over your eyes. And your daddy turnin' in his fuckin' grave. [breathing heavily] [tense drum beat playing] Show me what you're fuckin' made of. Fuckin' run. Fuckin' run. -Fuck you. -[metallic thud] -[gunshot] -[grunts] [engine starts] -[gunshot] -[shouting] [tyres screeching] Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! [engine roaring] [growls] [exhaust blaring] [tyres screeching] [grunts] [tyres screeching] -[sheep bleating] -[engine revving] [mouths] Ah, come on! [engine roaring] -[phone beeping] -[ringing tone] [Dympna] Speak and leave a message, whoever you are, ya big fuckin' sham. [message tone] [retching] [groans] [door bangs] [whinnying] [door closing] [gasps] [sobs] [gasping] [tape scraping] [grunts] [ringing tone] [voice message] Hi, this is Ursula, sorry I'm not here to take your call. Just leave a message and I'll get back to ya. [end message beep] Urs, it's Arm. Douglas. Em... I hope I'm not disturbing ya or anything. I wouldn't pick up the phone either... I suppose. I just thought I'd say sorry and... Haven't forgotten about you and... just give me a small bit of time, small bit of time, now... and, eh... goin' to get Jack that money. Goin' to make things right, you know? Maybe I'll tell Jack. Just tell him I said goodnight. All right so. ["Pretty little girl from Omagh" playing] [knocking] ♪ Best of all She tells them all ♪ ♪ She's happy as can be ♪ ♪ Oh, lucky me! ♪ ♪ Well, I don't know What she's done to me ♪ [music fades] Your brother went fuckin' mad. [grunts] [Hector] Jesus. [gasps] -Ya heard from him? -[Hector] What? Paudi? No. [woman] Hector? Who's there? I'm comin' in, Heck. Whatever this is about, we can go somewhere and talk about it because-- Shhh. An acquaintance of yours, Hector? He is, by and by... He's a friend of a young relative of mine. [Hector] My nephew. Douglas, Maire. Maire, Douglas. He used to box for the county. The carriage would suggest so, all right. Hector not tell ya I was comin' over? Well, now he did not. Sit down, please, the both of you. You have intruded right into the middle of our nightcap, young man. I was just about to serve a toddy to Hector and myself. Can I fix you one? A what? Do, dear, yeah. And, em... Cut us a few wodges of brack while you're at it. [Paudi] Please. [whispering] Whatever you have to say, say it low. She's to be kept out of this. That brother of yours lost it, the mink. Took a couple of pot-shots at me as I was gettin' the fuck out of Dodge. [stammering] Why-- Why would he do something like that? [Hector] Arm? [scoffs] Fannigan? The useless cunt was supposed to disappear. [sighs] Jesus! You fuckin'-- Settle down, man. You fucked this whole thing up. I'm takin' this old one's money, Heck. You're goin' to sit there quiet and let it happen. No, you're gettin' outta here. It's only a matter of time before-- Here we are now. Your toddy is not too strong. It only occurred to me in the kitchen. You must have driven across the country, and will soon be driving back again. So I made it mild. Lovely. So this lad is not your relative? [Maire] I'm sure I know you from somewhere. [laughing] No, no. Can I ask what the emergency was? Yeah. Eh, it seems there may have been an accident on the farm. -An accident? -Mmm. We may have to go now, my dear. Immediately. -Hector, what's the matter? -[glass rolls] Take another step yonder and I'll break both your fuckin' ankles. [Maire] Oh, God in heaven! He's bleeding. Hector, what is this all about? Sorry, Maire, [panting] I'm in your premises under false pretences. But if I am, then so too is the sidling cunt in the jumper. -He's after your money. -My money? That's not true, Maire. He has you wrapped round his little finger. It's what his kind does. Just take the money if that's what it takes for ya to leave. I am not what he says I am, Maire. -[glass shatters] -Jesus God! Just go and get the money. [mobile vibrating] [Dympna] Arm? Hey, Arm? -Dympna? -[Dympna] Where are you, buddy? Where the fuck are ya? Okay, things got outta hand back there, man, but it's all calm now, yeah? I got Paudi to calm down and... I just need you to come back in, man. Remember you're my bro, eh? Ha? You'll never see me again. I'm done. I'm leaving. You know it doesn't work that way, buddy. Not with him, ha? You know, Paudi's asking questions about Jack and Urs. What do ya mean? What I mean is... if I can't tell him where you are, I'm gonna have to tell him where they are. I don't wanna do that, man. You know what he'll fuckin' do to them, eh? -[Maire gasps] -No, Arm! -Oh, God! -[Hector roaring] Do ya hear that? [groaning] You go anywhere near my Jack, and Hector's dead. Dead, you understand? Is that where you been hidin'? At the widow's, eh? I'm here all right. Arm? Arm, just stay there, yeah? -No one else has to get hurt. -You thick fuckin' daft cunt! -[Hector] You fuckin' loaf! - Arm? [Arm] Now, get a move on. I'm sorry, Maire, please... [Dympna] Fuck. [Maire] The money won't help you. [Arm] It's not for me. Hurry up! It's all in there. Now, take it and go, please. [Ursula's voice indistinct] -[Ursula] Douglas? -[Maire] Douglas... ...won't make it right. You're hurt? [Maire] Whatever mess it is you're in, son, no amount of money will make it right. Whoever you gave it to, you'll only be involving them in all this. [lid bangs] [Arm groans] I can't... I can't... I can't turn up with nothin', you know? Can't keep givin' them nothin'. [Maire] Wait. I know you. I thought I recognised you. [sighs] You're that boxer. I remember you from the papers. The way they talked about you. You were only a boy. So was he. It's a hospital we should get you to. -No. -A doctor, at least. You have to think of the others. What others? The people in your life. Your family? Is this really what they want from you? Stolen money? You've done nothing yet. Nothing that cannot be turned back. [sighs] No, it's too late. You're right. Right. But it's okay. It has to be. [car door closes] [engine starts] [Maire] Hector? He's gone. Now, I'm sorry, Maire. You have to get out of here. Someone bad is coming.

I got your message. Is everything all right? [sighs] Fine. Fine, now. Right, so what do you want? How's Jack? He's fine. He's asleep. [Arm] Maybe you could tell him, tell him... Maybe you could tell him I asked for him? Sorry I haven't been around, Urs. [Ursula sighs] You're never out of me hair, are ya? In a useful way. A better way. You deserve better. [Ursula] Everyone deserves better. Maybe it should be the other way around altogether so. [Ursula] What does that mean? Nothin'. Look, I'll leave you to it. [Ursula] No... Douglas. - What does that mean? - Nothin'. I mean... Ah, you'll have better. Soon enough, when you're out of this fuckin' place. You'll find a way. [Ursula] Douglas? Now, you need to go and do your thing. I get that. I get that. And I know ya-- -You won't have to wait long. - Douglas? I... [sighs] Douglas, I got the job. [stifled sob] You got the job? Yeah, yeah. - The job in Rochestown? -Yes. - Rochestown in Cork? - [Ursula laughing] Yeah, yeah, I did. I'm so ha-- I'm so happy for you. [scoffing] All right, yeah, I'm sure you are. No, I mean it. I am. I am. I've been a kid throwin' a moody. You know? You know what I mean? Doing a Jack? [scoffs] Jack's better behaved than you. [laughing] [sniffles] Urs, I love you. [laughing] Jesus Christ... are you drunk? Yeah. [inhales] Yeah, a little. [Ursula] All right, so... Well, eh, I... We love you too, Douglas. [car approaching] [choked sob] Look, I'm going to leave you to it. Okay, well, em... [clears throat] Well, I'll speak to you tomorrow, so. -Yeah, yeah. -[car door closes] [slurring] All right, I'll speak to ya tomorrow. Goodnight, Douglas. 'Night. [whispers] G'night.
