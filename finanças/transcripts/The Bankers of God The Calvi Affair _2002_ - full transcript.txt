This film is dedicated to gian Maria volonte' The calvi affair - the bankers of god This film is based on known historical facts - Anna, whatis it? - Mr. Kane is coming. They've still got to pay for the torpedo-boats. - How many have the Peruvians got? - 5 or 6, I think. By the way... Is that ministry of defense story true? The general now knows that to sell arms, he must enroll in our lodge. - Still alive? - Sindona, it's not siesta time! What is it now? It's freezing, why not turn it down? Security says that Mr. Kane is coming. Tell the guards not to let anyone in after Kane, please! If he knows about the deal with the sandinistas, we deny it. Wake up! Kane's coming. Michele! Are you sick? The rise of the communists creates new problems. They represent changes that have occurred in Italian society and they could decide to adopt a mask of respectability. Considering their electoral success, maybe they already have. Italy would be the first country to slide eastwards. The "corriere della sera" is crucial. - That newspaper? What about me? - Are they fighting with dad? It's their business. Priority: Get the "corriere” away from communist influences. - That's enough, sindona! - Smile, dad knows what he's doing. What family? No family would abandon one of its members! I'd need a certain amount... Tell me, do you think it could save you this time or... - Would it be another failure? - Look who's talking! You declared to the press that you hardly knew me! What should I have done? Talk about the mess you made? The Vatican lost a lot of money. You lost nothing, not a cent! Even the firm was milked dry. - You gave me false accounts! - Let's stop this. Is there anyone who wants to give a few million dollars to sindona? Let's stop it for real, sindona. All right. I get it. In reference to that restructuring plan, how is the p2 lodge doing? Very well. You'll have the complete text soon. Sindona, banker to the mafia and the CIA, is jailed in the usa for bankruptcy. Archbishop marcinkus, although involved in sindona's downfall, stays on as chairman of the board of the Vatican bank, the I.0.R. Sindona's bankruptcy also leads to marcinkus' deputy at the ior, Luigi mennini being briefly detained. Calvi, chairman of the catholic banco ambrosiano, takes sindona's place. A well-known Spanish journalist writes: "Marcinkus and the I.0o.R., and calvi, continue to build a worldwide catholic network against communism." Sir! The Holy See has sent the envelope you were expecting. Ah, yes. The telex is top priority, please. Cancel rizzoli. - Rearrange my meeting with tassan din. - Don't you worry, sir. - Have a good trip. - Goodbye, mennini. Sir, I blocked that loan to the communist party. - We'll see... - Sorry, I don't understand. It seems the price to stop them from publishing was 250,000,000. A waste! The pope in his bathing costume doesn't shock anyone. - Thank them anyway. - Your holiness... To avoid being shot with something more dangerous than a camera lens... Your holiness, marcinkus and calvi are here. They're waiting in there. Speak of the devil! It's precisely marcinkus who should be handling my security. You may go. We'll discuss it another time. Here, I've brought you the tape. - Dear calvi, how are you? - Very well, thank you. - And your family? - They're all well, thanks. Solidarnosc must not be thought of as simply a trade union. Ready. Out of respect for his holiness, the pope's face is not shown in this film for millions of poles it is a means of fighting back. My brothers are waking up from the long sleep into which they had sunk after the hard decisions taken at yalta. The fight has begun to snatch Poland back from this somnambulism. I would like to help them... One must help them beat secular capitalist or marxist offensives. Marxist, your holiness... If you'll excuse me. Calvi is here for one reason only: To contribute to this struggle. Right-wing dictatorships decline, left-wing dictatorships remain. That is why they must be fought. Franco's and Salazar's dictatorships took a good while to decline! And if they don't get rid of pinochet, I'd like to see when he'll decline! The boss has a sense of time that's a bit different. We mustn't forget that he grew up in a socialist country and you know that time passes very slowly in those places. I'll find a channel in New York, and send money to the poles from there. Do you think they can fight the Russians with that loose change? To be frank, I don't find these solidarnosc types too agreeable. Never forget the role they have in this game. All right, they'll get the necessary money too. Your honor, licio gelli's not at home or in the office. Milan courthouse does anyone know you're in arezzo? No, we slept at a secret location. Go ahead. - Halt! No one can enter. - You'd better let her go in. - The captain knows? - No, but she's gelli's secretary. What are you doing? But... these are diplomatic papers! They're secret documents! Gelli is the economic advisor for the Argentinean embassy! - Please, madam! - You can't touch them! - I'm ortolani... - Just a moment! Yes, yes... Linsist! I must talk to the general immediately, it's urgent! - We'll block the communists! - It's of vital importance! - Find him, understand? - Two... Three... and four: Yes? At last! Gelli's here, I'll put him on. - General, listen to me carefully... - Yes! The documents seized show the p2 is a masonic organization linked to the secret services that seems to be headed by licio gelli. From confiscated lists, ministers, high ranking military officers... Officials in the secret services, deputies, journalists, industrialists... And magistrates are shown to be members of the said lodge. 962 names that reveal the existence of a power structure parallel to the state, capable it seems even of murder. The analysis of the documents shows the banco ambrosiano's chairman, Roberto calvi, to be the financial arm of the p2 lodge. Your honor, it's urgent. It's the head of the financial police. He's already called twice! Yes? Be careful! You can't violate the secrecy of diplomatic documents! The seized papers must be handed back to the owner! What are you saying?! How dare you! The documents stay here! - Who was it? - You think 1 don't know? - The big man. - In Milan. - We'll see some fireworks! - Yes... but look here. - "Government in p2 storm." - All smoke, no fire! "Calvi and associates risk six years in jail." Italy's not America. Public opinion doesn't count here. It's important that our enemies don't find out the names on the lists. - You think they won't be published? - Of course not! That's tassan din. I'm telling you, the situation's under control. The prosecutor's office in Rome will make them return my briefcase. - Keep calm! - How?! - And all those funds from palermo? - Come in! - But if... - Calm down! If we're not running risks, why are you holed-up in this bunker? It was them, the "friends", who advised me: "Keep a low profile for a month... the time it takes for things to settle down." Chairman, despite all this mess, at least you've got the "corriere". Listen... Let's be frank. The way things are, I'd never have paid out 180 billion for that paper. But you wouldn't want to lose it! You panic too quickly. Don't you think all this chaos is because they want it back? Whatever! But we'll decide when and at what price! Dad, sorry I'm late. There was a car and I was suspicious... - 1 had to lose it. - Good girl. - The plane's ready. - I'll be right there. The p2 masonic lodge scandal shakes parliament and the government. De martino declares that if the government doesn't make public the p2 list, the "sindona commission'; Which he chairs, will. Giulio, thank god! Forlani's reading a telex from gelli. Incredible! "Li am certain the names of the p2 members will not be published because the lists contain names of important Italians and foreigners..." Giulio! Gelli's asking us to not publish the list. Listen! "NATO and the western intelligence services would look negatively on any drastic action taken against p2 members." - It's an affront! - No, absolutely not... - It's a warning! - Calm down, gentlemen! It's unheard of! Mr. president, gelli's threatening you! It seems like a message for the initiated and the investigated. Well... I think we must ask ourselves if it's possible, with a single stroke, to sacrifice the important military and political personnel - linked to licio gelli and the p2. - Well, not all of them... We'll see... for example, the head of the intelligence service, the commander of the financial police, the prefect, the minister of justice... Perhaps we can serve up their head on a platter in parliament. It would be too great a risk! These are our men. I should resign as head of the government. Today in parliament, I won't name names. Clara, sorry. Sorry, I can't sleep... I can't sleep. The shame! The shame! Everyone thinks I'm the financial arm of the p2. You'd prefer them to say you're the mastermind? Who's this now? Sir, it's someone who won't give me his name. Let me see him. Mr. president, it's better not to be too trusting. Hope I didn't wake you. I was expecting you, come up. Who's he? He's been sent by the secretary of the DC. He's a big shot. He works for the secret services, the Americans too. He speaks 7 languages and makes deals worldwide. He's also a Mason! - He seems so young... - Have faith, he's the right one. He's called francesco pazienza. Get dressed, quickly! Will the politicians manage to hide the p2 members names? We can't do anything about the lists, they'll be published. And the other documents? Everything they seized from gelli will be made public. Unfortunately, from time to time, we live in a democracy. Darling... - It's over, it's all over... - Pardon. Madam, let me introduce myself: I'm an old style mercenary. So is the government going to fall? It will fall, madam. Also because the communists are doing their best. But let's not over-dramatize. This country's always on the brink: It seems like the world will end, then... It won't be the first time they make a mountain out of a molehill. - It'll be more private in my study. - Excuse me. Here's the passport. - It doesn't look anything like me! - He has the same hair as yours! I don't want to run away! - Have you heard from Kane? - He's disappeared. We're on dangerous ground. They could arrest you at any moment. - What does gelli say? - He's vanished! Couldn't be clearer... And I want to follow him. I'm not guilty, I can't abandon everything! Yes, but now help me. Don't just stand there! This isn't about being guilty or innocent. Get it? It's a bad moment. If you stay here, you're screwed. If I run away, they'll take the bank off me. Without the bank I don't exist, I'm nothing. I'm hurt, is there some disinfectant? It's nothing, use some spit! Listen to me, take it... He's even got a moustache! No one could have predicted an action so evil and sacrilegious. As the pope was blessing the faithful in St. Peter's square, a young, thin-faced man fired two shots at him. Wounded in two places, the pope fell into the arms of his companions. - The shots also hit... - Anna! Two American tourists. The attacker, a turk named Ali agca, tried to escape, but was arrested straight away by the police. Whilst the crowd reeled in shock, - the pope was taken to hospital - Dad's here! But his condition is not critical. - They shot at the pope! - I know, the world's going mad. Do you think it's an internal affair, like papa luciani? How did it go? The "cat" gave me this. He told me to disappear. If you go to the airport with this, they'll arrest you right away! Why don't you speak to your friends in the opus dei? They're thick as thieves with the pope! I think about it all the time. What about casaroli? - The "hunchback"? Eh? - But the one in charge is the pope. Yes, I know! But it's not that simple. Here we are. Clara! The financial police are here! So it's true, they want to take back the "corriere della sera". - I'm not to let you out of my sight. - Captain, let her get dressed! - You can't arrest him, he's innocent. - Keep calm! - Arrest me too! - Keep calm! I have strict orders. - I must take you to prison. - What? Roberto... Roberto! Don't touch him! - I won't get out alive. - Stop! Stop! I'm not going to prison. I won't move from here. You'll have to use force! If you arrest him, you'll have to arrest me too! Me too! All right! Where's the phone? There. - This way. You're lucky. - Lucky? They've put you in a cell with two terrorists and a thief. If you ended up in a camorra cell... Here are the news headlines for today. A week after the shooting, the pope's condition is improving... It's not like the grand hotel, sir, but you'll get used to it! Christian democrat councilor ciro cirillo has been abducted in Naples by an armed gang who also killed his two bodyguards. The red brigades claim responsibility, but the camorra are also being investigated. The councilor's car was attacked by four armed men who acted with speed and precision. Milan: Roberto calvi, chairman of the banco ambrosiano, has been arrested along with eight others on charges of illicit capital transference. Calvi, arrested by the financial police on the orders of substitute attorney d'ambrosio, is being held in lodi. You're a real symbol of capitalist decadence! They were members of the board of directors at centrale finanziaria, and are accused of infringing article 1 of the currency laws for illegal exports of foreign money. As a secular financier, what do you think of calvi's arrest? It's not appropriated to comment, the magistrates are busy. It's their job to uncover the facts. - The chaplain's here. - I'll see you at five. All right? Yes. I was acquainted with licio gelli, but I've never seen these documents. And this one? It's a photocopy of the ambrosiano inspection report ordered by the bank of Italy. How did gelli get hold of it? I don't know, I've no idea. Calvi, please, we've been here six hours... Do you want to tell us anything? I'm sorry, but the banking laws of the countries where the ambrosiano's subsidiaries are based, prohibits it. From the banco ambrosiano in Milan, the money goes to Luxembourg, via Nassau. It returns to Zurich, passes through Panama, and arrives at the banco andino in Peru. From there... These hundreds of millions of dollars disappear, as swallowed up by shell corporations. Calvi, enough of these secrets. You must tell us about these companies. And this transfer receipt from the ubs in Geneva? You paid 800,000 dollars to have your passport back. - 1 don't know anything. - But gelli gave it back to you! These documents are a crazy invention, - isn't that so? - Absolutely surreal! I'm astonished and worried. I don't know anything. Mazzotta! Rome-urbe airport after the greetings, you must tell the "the hunchback", "don't worry, we have no documents in Italy." Hurry up! Madam... I'm so sorry to see you - in such dramatic circumstances. - Don't worry, your honor. We have no documents in Italy! Please... in our opinion, madam, you are a person in whom we can place our trust, in the sense that only you can speak directly with your husband. I have an idea. I'm very pleased to meet you, madam. And your studies? I know you're about to graduate! You must really love your father to apply yourself so brilliantly in a way he never could! Thank you, Mrs. craxi. Tell me, madam. Your honor, they suggested I tell you that 30 billion lire is not a joke! We socialists want to help your husband because he's a friend. Yes but... as you know, the arrest warrant is not obligatory for the crime they've accused him of. Yes, it's true. Your honor, secular finance is persecuting him! But we have serious evidence against their leader. Why don't you and your ministry help us? Yes, but... it'll take time! Lodi prison - good morning. - Good morning. - I'll wait here, madam. - Yes. - Be brave. - Thanks, Alex. - Your father called me this morning. - Yes, I know all about it. Madam, please. - Be quick, this is not common practice! - Thank you. We came with mennini. He's outside with the chaplain. Nice secretary you have! - She won't come to the phone. - Yes, but let's tell him about Rome. The "hunchback" says the bank of Italy wants someone at the ambrosiano. But he suggests... He even introduced him to me! But if they put him in there, I'm ruined! Pazienza is so able! He even went to see Carlo in New York. Carlo's such a good boy! He wanted to come back to be near you, but I said no. He's more useful in New York. Pazienza agrees. Pazienza's very good! But he exaggerates sometimes: He says this is war between armed gangs! We've got other meetings with politicians. I don't trust politicians anymore. You mustn't go to them either. Give me some paper and a pen. Politicians are dangerous. "This trial is called ior" tell Alex to take it to marcinkus. "This trial is called ior." You shouldn't even say this name in confession! But really? Give me that note, madam! This trial is called ior! There, I said it. Now what? Ior! The Vatican - ior presidency this trial be called ior? We must be losing our minds! How did that idiot get this into his head? When they put those handcuffs on you... It's a shock. When they arrested me, all sorts of things went through my mind! I thought pope Paul vi could personally intervene and explain the relationship between ior and sindona. What makes me furious is that he thinks he must tell the judge that part of the 26 billion finished up here! Yes, I'm not saying that's right! But it's not a crime if calvi thought this would simplify his situation. Come in! - Please. - I was looking for you. Tell calvi it's time to be reasonable. He must realize this is just a bluff, we've got nothing to do with it. - This is political warfare! - Exactly! It was his turn to be arrested, and if he panics, he plays into their hands. You handle this. It's not easy, calvi is desperate. And while we're on the subject, tell him his son must stop sending faxes from New York! To his holiness, to cardinal silvestrini... What the devil's got into him? We've had enough! New York - u.N. Building monsignor is tired of spying on the American bishops. He couldn't care less about you. He wants to replace marcinkus, who's a pain in the ass. It's also true that marcinkus has used the ior for his own interests, get it? - Yes. - Good. You'd better give monsignor some information. We need to create an alliance with him. He's allied to the faction that opposes marcinkus, are you with me? - So, he's with the opus dei? - That's right! No problem, monsignor's waiting. Good! Please... Don't worry, it'll be fine. The important thing is that your father gets out of prison soon. Your father is not our friend, he socializes with masons and socialists. You know there are many doubts about the united trading company. It would be very interesting, and useful, to know when they made the contract which handed over management to the bank of gottardo. - But it's no secret! - Exactly! But we want to know the real date of this contract, not the official one. They're here, be quick. - Your son needs to be stopped. - But he's just a boy! And your wife and daughter should pray instead of stirring things up. In particular with pazienza. Roberto, they're preparing... Good evening. There's a judicial offensive against the "cat" and the "fox". - So, will I get my money back? - I don't know. But they'll be denounced by all those who think they were cheated by them. But there used to be a line to get into the p2. They want you to head a cleaned up p2. - Cleaned up? - Yes, Roberto, cleaned up! You make me nervous when you're like this! Were you crying? No! They have the radio on 24 hours a day in the cell, I can't stand it! Dad, are you going to come out against the "cat" and the "fox"? - What did you say? - They've got to get me out of here. - The director's arrived... time to go. - Oh god, I forgot: Pazienza asks what you want to do with the neapolitan politician. It's so much money... and I don't like this cirillo. But the secretary of the DC is doing anything to free him! Think about it... That's enough! Can I have more pills? - You've been taking them for a week. - Ican't sleep. All right. - Here. - Thanks. Go ahead, I'll catch you up. Doctor, I'd like... Why are you frightened? Come on... let's take a walk. Chairman, you mustn't worry. On our side, you've got nothing but friends... don't worry! Chairman, this poor compatriot of ours who has been kidnapped by the red brigades. Everyone wants to see him freed, right? - Yes... - Well then! What do we want to do to help him hug his family again? Those guys in Rome really care about this gentleman. Shall we get him out? Bloody hell! What's wrong with you? Please tell Roberto it was your idea to open the bag. - Do you trust me, or not? - Wait, wait... there! This is the document against secular finance. They speculated in gold, and moved everything via shell corporations... - Well... liberian companies. - Yes. What's more, their leader, mediobanca, has overdrawn funds for illegal business. It's unbelievable, they are attacking Roberto! - Shouldn't we attack secular finance? - But they've got no scruples! And us... with all that it's cost us! Here it is... here's the letter from the bank of Italy! It's tassan din! Quick! - It's better he doesn't see us. - No, stay here. Good dog! Don't worry, he won't bite. Get down! - Ah, I didn't know you were... - Stay, stay. It's about a very delicate matter. Don't worry, these men have my husband's trust. We have no secrets. Comein. What can I do for you? This is not just a suggestion... Believe me, it's very difficult for us to say this. If your husband wants to come out of prison, he must repent. - Repent? - Yes, repent! Speak out, especially against the socialists. The judges are expecting him to confess something. Anna! If daddy repents, he'll come out of jail. Tassan din told me. He must attack the socialists, but the lawyer will explain it all to you. Get changed quickly. You can't wear that. I already spoke to the prison, we've got a meeting tomorrow. Get that off. I think it's better if you go alone. - But who sent tassan din? - It's better we don't know! Your father will understand! You must tell him we cut open the seam on his bag, because we needed the documents against secular finance. Look at this! It's from the bank of Italy, read it! They'll give him 5 years for the foreign subsidiaries' withdrawal. You realize?! They're all scheming. It's a plot! I can't stand it in here. Are you investigating the eni-petromin affair? I could tell you many things, but you must get me out of here. Calvi, we're sorry but we don't have the powers to release a person who's detained on charges different to those he's on trial for. You are in here for violating the laws on capital transfer. If you want to collaborate, you must tell us about your banking practices. Operations that are incomprehensible. What is it? - 1 don't control the ambrosiano. - So why are you behaving as if you did? - I do what the others tell me. - Who? I can't say anymore. You're not telling us anything! Anything! - Who are these people? - They are... They are... Just a minute... They are... I don't want to lose the thread... They are gelli and ortolani. And sindona too. They made me understand that financial contribution to political parties would be very useful for me. I know I could have refused, but they made it forcefully clear that my group would suffer serious damages. Which parties did you finance? Sorry I'm late, please continue. The fact that certain members of the socialist party called to thank me for what I did for them, confirmed the destination of the money. Who telephoned you? The secretary of the socialist party... Don't name names! Please don't interrupt! It's inadmissible that you decide what he can or cannot say! Calvi sits nervously on a bench in front of the cage. The banker and the other players of the biggest trial ever brought against the heads of catholic finance have been spared handcuffs and sitting in the cage that has hosted terrorists, mafia bosses and big time criminals. Officers, please move ahd don't block the view. These defendants are no different from anybody else: Photographers have a right to take pictures of them. Listen to me. Word's out that you're going to repent. Watch out. Retract! They say if you go on like this, you'll be in prison for life! - Get it? Do I have to repeat it? - Yes... no-no, all right. Madam, your husband has attempted suicide. Roberto! He can fake lots of suicides, but he'll always come back here. The attempted suicide of banker calvi, forcefully reproposes the disturbing problem of a power struggle conducted unscrupulously, with intimidatory violence. It would only take bankruptcy of the stock exchange to measure the dangerous consequences of this power struggle! But who's in charge? Many are responsible... For example, the judges, whose initiatives are foolish and rushed! Of course, it's the judges' fault! Calvi's a good guy! When people are arrested, it's easy to predict trouble on the stock exchange... Poor calvi! Even if he gets out, he'll have to say goodbye to the bank. I don't think anything like that will happen. After 40 years of Christian democrat governments, is underway. This change is due to the p2 scandal which engulfed the previous government. Yesterday andreotti had a long meeting with casaroli: He's very worried! - And poor calvi? - He's shown himself to be tough. He swallowed 40 pills and slit one of his wrists. That would have killed most people. He knows how to resist... - Just like you. - This was an extreme act. What if he receives a reassuring message... Your holiness, casaroli is here. It's time for me to go for a little smoke. Your holiness... The judges already received the letter. Marcinkus hopes you'll appreciate this reassuring gesture. It's a useless gesture. It's not enough to say the ambrosiano had nothing to do with that money. They need to say where it ended up! I'l tell marcinkus. But... Good morning. Pazienza says you must reveal the names of the real ambrosiano bosses. The ones who are behind it all... Lots of people think that is you. They must keep thinking that. It'll be worse if they don't... No one will come to my aid. Keep still! You're making me sea-sick. I was looking for bugs. What a mistake... This story about the socialists. But it's nothing compared to what I could have revealed... And they know only too well. And despite it all... - Yes? - Excuse me, the judges are here. - Good morning. - Good morning. There's only this seat. Mr. president, excuse me. You're still not well. And I'm here to ask you something that will need courage to answer. Is it true you were threatened? No, I wasn't threatened. So, why do this? The papers say you're a tough guy. You did it because the stock exchange was crashing? I couldn't care less about that. Let's say it was a gesture... Of lucid desperation. Where was gelli's daughter returning from? A very long journey... Rome - secret service Brazil, Paris, nice and then Rome. Who interrogated her after she was arrested at the airport? Domenico sica. Where were gelli's documents? There. In the false bottom of her case. The documents are authentic? Maybe. This one for example... Is amongst the most disconcerting. The Pentagon stamp is definitely authentic. We checked the signature... And it really is westmoreland's. Gelli could be responsible for his daughter's arrest. He says: "Sirs, I had my orders which I obeyed." He doesn't want to stay in hiding for life. Of course, if he wants to frame someone at the top... It's essential that the documents are absolutely authentic. It's in your interests to keep their authenticity ambiguous. It's for me. Hello. Roberto's depressed. Very depressed. He's got no hope... He's never trusted politicians. What happened in parliament was a hice move. They're using Roberto to attack the judges. Get him out of prison. Immediately! We have to take a decision, use all the means at our disposal, get ourselves armed! - Play tough. - All right. To hell with scruples. Go ahead, immediately. Who is it? It's him, he's here. Vincenzo! They're here just in time, we've finished right now. Is everything ready? We've did 20,000. Pretty good. "Mediobanca monetary frauds." Nice color. Good work. "With the silence of the bank of Italy, mediobanca committed monetary fraud." - Is it too much? - Too much? He must get out of jail and go back to the ambrosiano... - The addresses? - Here's the list. One copy for each envelope, then we wait for the signals. - And if they don't work? - Don't worry. What about calvi? Is it all there? Calvi's a real gentleman. So we can send cirillo back home. Oh god, he's so ugly! Mazzotta, he's worse than you! The prosecution not only holds that the crime was committed, but also that calvi is without scruples. His relationship with gelli could be deemed to be gravely iniquitous given the corrupting influence of gelli and the p2 set up by him. Excuse me. So this court condemns Roberto calvi to four years imprisonment and a fine of 16 billion. This is unacceptable. The sentence was predictable, give or take a year. Don't look like that. In Italy, you're released right after you're condemned. - We'll even get him a passport. - Yes... My dear lawyer! He's finished. He'll have to leave the banco ambrosiano. They're already waiting for you in the conference room. Stay at my disposal, we'll release the board's final decision today. - Excuse me, Mr. president. - Later, mennini. At this point, he must resign. He knows too many secrets, how can we go on without him? Sit down, gentlemen. Gentlemen... Some of you will be surprised at my return. I would like to dissipate this surprise right away. According to the law, the bank of Italy would have to sit a commissioner. But only... For the following three circumstances. One: If serious irregularities have been detected. Two: If there are significant capital losses. Three: If the board of directors, that is you, requests it. The first and second cases do not apply. The third, that is, your request, would seem rather senseless given that the bank's affairs have yielded good results over the last few months. The facts... are in the final analysis, the rest is gossip. Are you crying? Tell me, what else is happening? If you want to cry like a baby, just don't let anyone see you. Even I have to pretend with my family... What else is happening? Nothing... You won't understand. Nicely done... keep on believing the rest of us are stupid. Since your arrest, foreign banks won't give you loans. In fact, they want back the loans they already made you, right? - Who told you this? - Pazienza. Ah, yes. Him... - You don't even trust him now? - Yes, of course... Anyway, he keeps taking money from me. Worse than the "cat" and the "fox". And what if he sides with secular finance? - You're getting paranoid. - Paranoid? You think I should trust him? And rosone too... I made him vice-chairman, but whose side is he on? I had to put the "hunchback's" man on the board. Did I do the right thing? And marcinkus? He's only interested in becoming a cardinal. Come on, drink this before you get that awful cough again. Know what's the matter? You're exhausted. You're tired. The other day, even pazienza said, "how long is it since you and Roberto took a vacation?" At the seaside... It's a pleasure to see you. Porto rotondo pazienza rents a villa for calvi carboni's coming. - Professor... - Francesco, thanks for the invite. - Excuse us a moment. - Of course. He must stop pretending he's on the phone. Bring him outside, the others are arriving. - Yes... Excuse me... The Latin American "cover actions" are nearly all financed by its subsidiaries. What's the percentage? A big one. But we don't know what they're doing with the money. In London we've seen they're trying to buy the banco ambrosiano on their own. - You know pippo calo's coming? - Not alone. - My favorite ambassador. - How are you? Put the phone down. - I'll call you back soon. - Who am I? Enough of these jokes, francesco. If you know, why are you so scared? Guess who's coming. I just opened the door for him. Who would that be? The one with the wig and the cheese is carboni. He looks like a sardinian landowner with his cheese and escort... There's not a person in Italy he can't convince to get involved. Just think, he's an intimate friend of the future masonic leader. See how small he is. He's a partner of the most prestigious sardinian newspaper, he's about to build a gigantic residential complex... That will make aga Khan green with envy. And that's not all. He has close relationships with the decision makers in the Vatican. - You said "decision makers"? - The very top. - Did you get it? - Yesterday. - Carmen! - My darling. Flavio, how are you doing? - But he's armed! - With all these kidnappings... So what? Who are the others? The one with the tie is the president of sardinia. The other is the treasury undersecretary, a friend of the minister. Isn't the professor very close to the minister? - No, he's an advisor. He's very close too. Cheers! - And her? - A friend. - And what are "cover actions"? - Well... It's secret service stuff... Ask your husband. She's a spy? No, she's a lawyer from Panama. Let's go and meet carboni. Hi. Welcome, flavio. I'll leave you. Mr. president... it's a pleasure to meet certain people, an honor to meet others... With you, it's the latter. Thank you. It's an honor for me too. When will he get here? It's so hot. Oh god, look who it is! - Let's turn back. - It's useless, he's seen us. How are you, calvi? You look very well. Well, thanks. Have you met my wife? Not really, but she knows me very well. She even has some stinging bills printed up. Excuse me. - Francesco! - Clara! - Chairman, look who I've brought you. - How are you? She's a delicate woman. She suffered very much during my imprisonment. - I understand. - Otherwise, she wouldn't have done it. How's it going at the ambrosiano? For my wife, secular finance is a kind of myth. A myth or a bogeyman? Go, they're waiting for you. Mazzotta, hurry up. We could see each other this evening. No, I received instructions in code. They ordered me to keep giving money to the Panamanians. Calm down! We're here to talk about this. Calvi, you know we've always trusted you... But this must be cleared up! That's why I've come here! He's a good spy, your chaplain. But you told him to refer everything to me. Paul... So what about these guarantee letters? If I write them, everyone will think we're behind the Panamanians. Those who must think that will. Don't worry. How much is the deficit? One billion, more or less... - What the fuck are you saying? - One billion, more or less. I should guarantee a debt of one billion dollars? No... no. But it's the billion I gave to solidarnosc... Sit down. Calm yourself. Why don't you try to sell that damned newspaper? "Corriere della sera" is worth at least 200 billion lire. You must do something. Right away. But if they don't give me my passport back, I can't move. Know what we'll do? We'll try praying. My lord, we put ourselves in your hands and our trust in you. Only you can help us. Roberto asks me to write a letter. I'll do it. Sorry I'm late. You can go back to Lima. Here are the letters of guarantee. One is addressed to the bank andino, the other to the commercial of Nicaragua. The contents are identical. Both are signed by marcinkus. As you see, the ior admits ownership of the Panamanian companies. So, the majority shareholder is the ior. It confirms they're well aware of the andino's and commercial's debts. Does it also say why the fuck the Panamanians need to suck our billions from our overseas subsidiaries? Rosone, please. The total corresponds to the debt amount, so if nothing else we've frozen the debt. Yes, but the debt remains and it must be paid sooner or later. So, we'll sell the guarantee package. I have the authority. Of course, the share... But even if we inflate it, it won't cover half the debt. Who'll come up with the rest? In the space of a few months, the debts will be reduced... And then we'll get the Vatican to take the next step, since they've already taken the first. - What's the second step? - What was that? What is it? I've never known the dogs so hervous, what time is it? - It's seven. - Seven? - Who can it be? - Someone's here! Keep calm. Take care of the dogs. We'll check the video. There's no one here. But there was someone. Are you sure you want to break off ties with pazienza? Dad, mum's right. You must decide whether pazienza's useful as a friend, or not. You always said you can't do business without the aid of the secret service. What secret service? - Who's this now? - It's him. Who? Get dressed. You lock up the dogs. Sir, there's someone for you but he won't give a name. Bring him up. I'll be right there. Am I too early, president? Even those of us who live in the capital are on time when it's worth it. You said at seven? Here I am. Excuse me for not being dressed. I imagine you came in your private plane. I couldn't tell you over the phone, but you can guess who sent me. Oh, the rocks of Capri... He spoke very highly of you. If we help him, as we surely will, he'll be the grand master of the free masons. You know better than me what that means. Yes, for the elections... How much is needed? Five billion. All right. But what I'm interested in now is relations with the Vatican. We're not at a breaking point, but secular finance is taking advantage - and moving hidden forces. - Is there a plot? You think my arrest was casual? They want to hit catholic finance through me. Can you prove it? What kind of plot would it be if I could prove it? Madam! It's a real pleasure to see you again. Why didn't we meet in your office? Because the less you're seen in the Vatican the better. Read this. It's from the bank of gottardo. Beautiful, eh? They're my nieces. Didn't you meet my beautiful nieces? But we spoke about the debt and the letters of guarantee. I wouldn't forget 300 million dollars, don't talk bullshit! The debt grows continuously. We can't go on like this. Enough! Enough, enough. Look, I can say... "Enough" too. Good, start with this 300 million and don't forget that the guarantees in my letters expire at the end of June. See what you can do. I'll do it. I'll do it. Geneva: Masonic lodge I will now read the agenda for today's meeting as approved by the committee on September 26th. Unions: They must be brought back to their natural duties... Even at the cost of a split. Only then it will be possible to restrict the right to strike. Magistrates: The most urgent changes involve the responsibility of judges. And now... these judges have exceeded all limits. I agree with Mr. Kane. To control them better, we need to separate their careers. And increase the number of politicians on the supreme council of magistrates. Excuse me. Dad, it's the secret line. Shall I say you're here? No, stay with vittorio. I'll go. Roberto, your idea to get the opus dei to cover the debt is brilliant! Really brilliant! I've put our friends in the Spanish opus dei into action. They're too reactionary, too anti-Soviet. If they take over the ior... The Vatican's foreign politics will radically change, understand? Are you scared of casaroli? Scared of the "hunchback"? - They've already made a move. - You mustn't give a damn. The pope goes crazy for the opus dei, not for the Soviets. Why all these doubts? It's going well. They'll cover the debt regardless of marcinkus, casaroli, the "hunchback', and the rest of them. And secular finance as well. Your eminence, a gesture would suffice. No, the crucial point is another. Calvi assures that this is nothing like the sindona case... understand? Calvi says that if he talked, there wouldn't be a stone left of St. Peter's. If it's true that the opus dei is sensitive about the integrity of the church... Tell calvi we'll do everything possible. - Go, we'll speak soon. - All right, let's go. Dear palazzini, we all know that his holiness has always held the opus dei in high regard. But... There's a right time for everything. Calvi! Cardinal palazzini was very kind. He told about the first time you met. Sit down. He said, "I remember calvi very well. Paul vl was always favorably disposed towards him." His eminence is not ashamed to say what he thinks, me neither... So I said to him straight up: "Eminence, to fill the hole keep it in the family." The hole? No, I didn't say "the hole". I said "restructuring operation". And it's better if secular finance doesn't interfere between the ambrosiano and ior. I put it to him like this: "Eminence, the opus dei must cover the whole cost of restructuring, and in exchange we'll have the controlling stake. But calvi must remain there, otherwise there would be detrimental effects on his work, on everything he's in charge of and on his safety." Safety? Exactly... President, you must realize this is war, and we're in the midst of it. Minute for minute. It'd be tough if we weren't backed by an organization that's ten times more powerful than the Christian democrats. When we want, we can go to anyone at the top. To anyone. Yes... When are we going to the grand master? Tonight. I was forgetting: The little brother thanks you. The dollars arrived and I'll transfer them to the appropriate person. Who is it? Excuse me. He's on his way up. Mr. president, excuse me for interrupting. The treasury bills are here. At last. Good, so the lawyer will take care of the judges. Cheer, Mr. president! This appeal is going to be like a walk in the park. I hope so. Stop that banker with all the money I spent. Carboni... Flavio. Flavio! Are we sure calvi will launder them? 800 million lire is a big amount! What a question... But calvi says the price is a bit excessive, what do you think? What can I say? Obviously he's never had to earn money. Oh, father... - New developments? - Believe me, it wasn't easy... But the pope has finally agreed to see you. So, how did it go? What happened?! Let me go! Something marvelous... The pope wants to see me. Once the debt is made good, he'll give me the Vatican finance to restructure. Great! I'll go tell vittorio, he'll be really pleased. Wait, Anna, no one must know. Not even your boyfriend. It's a secret. We're really sure about this? I feel that by signing this, I'm digging my own grave. Here, for example... I admit that I acted without the prior consent of the ior executives. Here I admit to having abused their trust. And here I declare I'm willing to leave without any compensation to avoid a "catastrophe of unimaginable proportions." If the cardinals don't believe you're prepared to sacrifice yourself for the church, we're finished! It's true... You must admit to making mistakes. It's the only way, they'll believe you're acting in good faith. Let's cut to the chase. Cardinal palazzini specifies the letter be used against marcinkus by his enemies. There's no evidence better than yours against marcinkus. You should have watched him, but you didn't. - And the meeting with the pope? - You're right to be impatient. But we mustn't forget what's at stake here. Well, there's a very delicate power change in the balance... It's very dangerous and even the bravest are trembling. Yes, I understand, but... President, let's go to see the grand master. He'll receive us at the palace, with full honors. He signed his surrender. Lunch has been prepared for you too. Your holiness, after the list of our proposals, there's also a letter from calvi. We inserted the names of our brothers in the opus dei who are ready to shoulder the debt. On condition that calvi and marcinkus are relieved of their responsibilities. We'll see what can be done... A financial system can also be adjusted... Or transformed under the right conditions. But politics must be confronted... With all the tendencies conditioned by the course of history. Is that clear? No corpses. In Milan, corpses stink. Don't worry, I wouldn't be here otherwise. It'll be a piece of cake. I'll go, it's her. Hi, gorgeous! - Wait in the car. 2 minutes - Okay. And they say women aren't punctual. How much does "baffino" owe us? If we take our share, it's 100 billion. Then calvi will move his ass. Go on. Move it. Wait. Take this. A little gift for your girl. So she doesn't forget us. See you later. Go! Roberto! "Rosone, vice-chairman of the ambrosiano, injured in a shooting" Anna, your father's vanished. I called to him. He didn't answer. Roberto! I think I know, come on! What are you doing? When there's money at stake, people are willing to do anything. - Leave me alone! - Roberto... Roberto! If they come, I'll shoot them. It's practical and convenient, you've always locked your bag with a combination. Go in there. So it's true. Today rosone, tomorrow you. Why make him the vice-chairman? Why did they shoot him? Because he launders the mafia money badly, or because he refuses to? How are you mixed up with the mafia? Come on, tell me! Who are you scared of? Marcinkus? Casaroli? The "hunchback"? The "cat" and the "fox" the mafia? The socialists? Secular finance? The secret services? The free masons? Don't you have too many enemies? You said, "you can buy everything with money, it's just a question of price." You've splashed your money around, and what have you got in return? No... don't worry. Don't be scared. The thing I've set in motion... Is a very delicate power shift. Opus dei will get rid of marcinkus and take over the Vatican finances. - And you? - I'll stay in my place. You see, it's a complex, dangerous... Operation that'd make anyone afraid. But I'm scared because you're scared. Yes, I'm scared. Let's get away from here. Please... let's get away. No. I don't want to lose ten years of power. - And then there are my friends. - Oh yes: Pazienza, carboni... They're just there to rip money off you. Pazienza knows the men who shot rosone? Yes, he knows them. The secret service knows them too. Everyone knows everyone... They are playing all sorts of games. I feel surrounded... Like I'm clutching at straws. Mum... What is it? There's something that dad's scared to tell you. What? In order to get at him, they threaten to hurt you. I don't want to go. I can't be away from the family. I can't cope without you. We've got friends in Washington, you know that. You and Carlo will be fine... You must go! We're already old. We can love each other long distance... Go on. Would you have some tea? Yes? Your holiness... There's a letter. Your enemies even know how to write. Read it, if you don't mind. Where they talk about the "Panamanians”, the shell corporations. "Your holiness, the shell corporations are receptacles of filthy economic trade. They launder money and trafficin arms and diamonds. They finance subversive right-wing groups. They receive the financial transactions of the secret service. They support dictatorships." But karol, it's an anonymous letter. Go to the end of the page, the last sentence. "Why does the ior, in the letters marcinkus issued to calvi, openly declare itself to be the patron of the shell corporations... In which the majority shares of the ambrosiano have been placed?" Let's hope a copy of this letter doesn't reach the cardinals... I'd like to see casaroli's face. Let me tell you something about the cardinals... As if they didn't know that without money you can't do a thing, not even charity. Yes, of course. We can't dictate the laws that increase money... But that doesn't mean we have to enforce them all. - Yes. - Tell me about the guarantees to calvi. They have no legal value. Consider them an act of friendship towards calvi. Will you have tea with me? Yes. And calvi? That man is a mystery. Paul, the cardinals of the opus dei, are after your head. I think it would be a very dangerous move. The opus dei are too reactionary. I don't mean your good relations with Reagan would be damaged... But it would harm your image. Yes, but some ties should be broken... milk or lemon? Lemon. Bank of Italy Comein. Come in, calvi. Please. This wouldn't even be sent to a sausage vendor, gentlemen. Drop it, calvi. Time's run out. The loans your group have made to unidentified third parties... Exceed 1400 million dollars. An abnormally large sum. A very high risk. Calvi... no more secrets. We demand you convene a meeting of your board of directors right away. Mennini! Tell marcinkus that the bank of Italy have traced all of the missing money. Piece by piece. They insist that I hold a board meeting as soon as possible. - It's the end, understand? - Calvi... Don't you realize that I'm worried too? If 1 think that what happened with sindona could happen again... If you don't want it to happen again, then do something... You've already been in jail and you don't want to go back. Don't you see that it's no longer in our hands now? It all depends on the pope. Marcinkus! Marcinkus... Let's get out of here, move! It's not good for anyone to abandon me when I'm facing ruin... That's why you gave me the letters of guarantee. This way. - Please. - Aren't we going to your office? No, it's better to go somewhere more private where we can talk without being disturbed. Wait a moment. Don't make that face. Here, I'm the only one who should be afraid... Of your blackmailing. Every envelope contains correspondence between the bank of Italy and our bank. As you can see, the subject of the letters is always the same: The bank of Italy asks for information, always more detailed, on our shareholdings and the group's foreign debt. Hello. Ah, it's you! No, he's fine and self-confident. It may seem absurd, but it's true. How's it going? All the letters must be closely examined... So, I propose we adjourn this meeting. I agree that we should adjourn the meeting, but I propose the board members take the documents home for study. The papers must not leave the group. On the contrary, I propose that even the auditors can examine them wherever they want to. I'm sure that a news leak would be the end of the ambrosiano. But we can't stay shut up in this room for days. - What do you think, rosone? - I'm in favor of confidentiality. They must not leave here. Good. I put the vice-chairman's proposal to the vote. Those in favor of letting the documents out, raise your hands. For my part, I shall abstain. I'll abstain too. But it's a mistake to let the documents leave the bank. You'll realize! No, I'm tired of the way it's going. They must hurry. You must tell them... That if they don't decide to accept my proposals, I'll tell everything. That's what I'm doing! If I was you, I'd leave as soon as possible. I can't, I still need a few days. Do what you think, but I just wouldn't want the communist judges to issue a warrant for your arrest. Or that someone is waiting for you outside your house. They go after power like dogs go after a bone. But I'll destroy this bone. Enough talk, they want facts! The facts? Here are the facts. And there are other documents in the safe in Zurich. It's a bomb, you'll see. They'll see what I'm capable if they push me. If they want a war, they'll get a war. But as soon as you leave, they'll realize you're for real. So, the sooner you leave, the quicker the situation will get started. Listen to me! In a moment like this, you must admit it was a sacrifice for me to finance the purchase of those missiles. Yes, all right. Why didn't you tell me you'd brought your departure forward? I've no choice. I've got to work quickly if I want to complete my project. So it's still going on? Will the opus dei assume the debt? There are people who'll do anything to stop me. That's why I've got to hide. And if the plan fails... I'll tell everything. Wait, I'll be right back. Anna, listen to me: You've got to leave too. You're in danger here. Dad... Why is the mafia against you? The mafia is a power and it's against those who has a secret to reveal. Anna, pack your bags. Go to vittorio's house and then to lugano this evening. Go! - I'm scared they followed me. - Let's go. Quick. Calvi entrusts himself to carboni's men Calvi escapes to venice with pellicani and entrusts his expatriation to vittor Hereitis. Carboni expects a phone call straight away. Here's the passport. Flavio says it's better if you let me take the bag for you. - Is this risky? - No, but you never know... At the yugoslavian or Austrian borders they could open it and identify you. Of course, the Nicaraguan passport. Flavio thinks of everything. All right, but please: There are very important documents inside. Don't worry, I come and go from klagenfurt. I'm at home here. They don't even ask to see my papers. Goodbye. Go! Go! "Gian Roberto calvini" they've not racked their brains... Carboni and his men return to Rome Thanks. Mrs. kleinszig. Mrs. kleinszig! - I'm Roberto calvi. - Welcome. "Your holiness, there are many people who want to know whether I supplied arms and other means to certain south American regimes, whether I financed solidarnosc and supplied arms and money to eastern bloc countries and organizations. But I won't be blackmailed and I won't blackmail anyone. Lugano - marcote guesthouse hello... Did I wake you? Sorry. I travelled all night, I'm dead tired. Dad! Where are you? How are you? Don't call me dad. I'm in Austria, in a friends' house. Tomorrow I'm going to Zurich to get money and documents. Listen, Anna... Call mum and Carlo. Don't tell them where I am. Your mum can't lie and if they interrogate her, she'll tell everything. Yesterday, pazienza called her from London. He wanted to know how you'd left since he has your passport. He told her what a fuss there will be when they find out you're disappeared. Reassure her, tell her I've not left but I've gone into hiding to further my plan. I'll call you tomorrow. Try to get news from Italy, and please, be careful. The lawyers of Roberto calvi have informed the judges that the banco ambrosiano's chairman has disappeared. They've had no news of him since the night of June 10th. Calvi is scheduled to appear in court on June 21st... Miss corrocher, please! On charges of illicit capital transfer. Welcome! I got through with no problems. Hereitis. - Thanks. - President... - You get younger. - Manuela, you're too kind. The falklands crisis has resulted in war between the uk and Argentina... - Where's my little girl? - Daddy! Hello, love. Look what I've got. - How did it go? - Smoothly. - I'll be right back. - Flavio. Everything is photocopied. We'll talk about it later. What an absurd war! They don't explain why it's happening. What do you think, Mr. calvi? They can't say they're fighting for oil. Flavio, this is a little gift for you. No, it's too precious. = no, 1 can't... Please, it means a lot to me. It's the nicest gift I've ever had. Calvi asks for incriminating documents from an Austrian arms dealer "It's likely that carboni was ordered not to take calvi to Switzerland...” - Are we leaving or not? - No. I knew you were crazy. Good. You're not going to Zurich. I'm sorry but it's not my fault. Carboni goes to Zurich alone Kunz, an arms dealer, arrives Calvi gave millions of dollars to carboni to pay off the mafia And after stalingrad, with the hunger and the cold and the ice, was hell... I made them get off the horses and forced them to walk. That way they didn't die of cold. Vittor, you won't believe me, but I got all my boys back home safe and sound. There they are! There's kunz. Finally. How's it going, kunz? I'm well. Flavio, when do we leave for Zurich? There's a change of plan. I'll explain later. "Carboni organized the trip and made the decision of going to London..." He'll convince him. London - Gatwick Thanks. Here. Which do you prefer, chairman? Where've you brought me? You're right. It's no place for the president of European bankers. In fact, they're both horrible. I'm surprised at flavio. Actually, kunz took care of it. How can I receive guests in this hovel? Carboni knows what he's doing, there must be a reason. He's prioritized security. We haven't even met the concierge. I'm going shopping. Don't open the door for any reason. I've got to open it for you. I'll give you a signal: Two consecutive knocks and a third after a pause. - Clear? - Yes... London -Hilton hotel - see you soon, darling. - See you. Vittor! As far as calvi knows, we're still in Stockholm. What are you talking about? We're in Amsterdam. - And you don't tell him which hotel. - Okay. Go on, stop that taxi! Taxi! Vittor! Tell Roberto I'm trying my hardest to find him a better place to stay. I'll handle it. Bye. We're counting on youl! Clara, something's about to happen... Everything will be like it was before. It's something extraordinary, marvelous. When you find out you'll finally feel as if... I can't tell you anymore. - Sorry, I've got to go. - Call me back though. - Vittor? - It's me. - Did carboni call? - Yes, he should be here in a while. Hello? Hello? It's the third time they call, but then no one speaks. You see, it's not you they want to speak to. Anyway, I know it's calvi and I know who he wants to talk to. Rosone, you and me will do great things. The blame will fall on the absent. The absent... - The absent? - Yes, calvi! And how the devil do you know he won't come back? I just said he was absent. London 16-06-82 the talking is over! You can't get out of this one, my dear monsignor. These declare the ior to be the real owner of the Panamanian companies. They declare full knowledge of the debts to our subsidiaries in Lima, Managua and Nassau. 1100 million dollars, plus another 200 that your bank owes directly to ours. You either cover the debt or you go bankrupt! - You have calvi's letter? - Yes. This is how things are: These are my letters of guarantee. This is a letter of indemnity. This latter here voids all my previous ones. They're worth nothing. Have them framed and put them on the wall. What? Put them on the wall? But these... these are... These are from the pope, from the Vatican. These are not from Mr. Joe blow! In this letter calvi declares, and you can verify it yourself... That whatever happens, the ior won't suffer loss or damage in the future. Practically, we don't have to give you a cent, guess it's what you've come to while you were signing papers to underwrite the debt... You were obliging calvi to write a letter that doesn't guarantee a fucking thing! Well then, you're nothing more than a bunch of gangsters! Let's get out of here! I repeated your exact words: "Chairman, they've arrested pellicani." He turned pale. When I added, "they're grilling him to find out where you're hiding", he got upset. I almost felt sorry for him. Yes, all right. We'll talk later, bye. Anna, listen carefully: Just when things were looking good, everything went wrong. Leave Zurich right now and go to mum and Carlo. There's no time to lose. Can I think about it, dad? I don't feel like just suddenly leaving for Washington. Can't you see you're in danger?! They've arrested pellicani. They're beating and grilling him: He'll talk. He'll tell them where I am. I've got to hang up. Go buy a ticket. Yes, I'll call back in 2 hours. Who is it? There's not even a place on the waiting list. It's a miracle I found a place on tomorrow's flight. Just one place? But vittorio must go with you. He's in danger too. Vittorio can't leave. He's got no passport. Let me speak to him. Listen, vittorio. Today or tomorrow, something will happen. Yes, a big stir. You can't stay. I'm not asking, I'm telling you. - I'll go back to Italy. - No. Anywhere but Italy. If they get you, you'll end up like pellicani. They're still grilling him. I understand. Good. Kunz's wife will be in touch. She'll give you money. Take it and go. We can't trust certain people anymore. I'll call you tomorrow at 8, before Anna leaves. It'll be difficult to call after, okay? Please, be careful. Ambrosiano bank June 17th. Around 4.00 pm The worse thing is that rosone knows everything. He's always lied at every board meeting. - Ah rosone, you must explain! - Sit down. Gentlemen, this is my proposal I would like to put to the vote. Roberto calvi cannot fulfil his duties, including that of legal representation. Therefore, in the interests of the bank and calvi himself, who may well have been obliged to act against his will, the board decides to revoke all of his powers and suspend his chairmanship. Those in favor of this motion, raise your hands. Good, motion passed. I'd like to point out that my abstention is not in calvi's favor, but is against those political forces that want to hand over the ambrosiano to a commissionet... Chosen by the bank of Italy. You don't want it because you want to take calvi's place. Tell us about the political force that put you here when calvi was in jail! No, all hell's breaking loose here! Poor miss corrocher couldn't take it... She threw herself from the 4th floor... What are you saying? Miss corrocher? Now she can't talk anymore. Did anyone see her do it? No, no one saw her.

Dear lord, we know Robert calvi must answer to your divine justice. He didn't mean to harm anyone. He reached the top and wanted to stay there. Dear lord, we entrust to your infinite mercy... The tormented soul of Roberto calvi. A man in whom we placed our trust. A man who had a busy life... Which we would not have imagined... To end in this way. Francesco pazienza left London just before calvi's death the Italian intelligence reports to the interior ministry that licio gelli is hiding... In gland in Peter notz's villa together with ortolani, pazienza and carboni milanese judges order the arrest of marcinkus and mennini for involvement in the fraudulent bankruptcy of the banco ambrosiano, "the century's greatest financial scandal” the court of appeal revokes the arrest warrants for marcinkus and mennini the British courts initially ruled that calvi's death was suicide, but later stated that it was not possible to determine whether it was suicide or murder conversely, the milanese civil court ruled he was murdered by unknown parties the methods used by the perpetrators charged with sinister threats, seemed to indicate the Vatican was not involved in calvi's death threats against anyone who dares to challenge, the rules and power of the freemasons, like calvi did threats against those who, during the falklands war, gave political support and arms to Argentina, whose flag is the same color as blackfriars bridge threats against the opus dei, whose banco urquijo is close to blackfriars bridge furthermore, the documents recovered from calvi's bag were used for many years to blackmail the Vatican after years of judicial inertia, the case is re-opened in Rome by judge Mario almerighi whose life is subsequently threatened following almerighi's sentence, pippo calo and flavio carboni are arrested for calvi's murder who is blocking the trial for calvi's murder?
