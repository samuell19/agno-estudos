What if I fail them? Worst of all, if the resistance doesn't stop her, I'll be failing you, my love. Christian, stop. Your ministry and your vision for this town are both beyond reproach. No matter where we are, you could never fail us. I was actually thinking the exact opposite. What are you talking about? All you've ever wanted to be was a husband and a father. I didn't know that… I would have so much trouble making that second dream come true for you. Love, are you… I didn't want to be a husband and a father. I wanted to be your husband, and I wanted to be a father to our children if we're meant to have them.

Oh, you didn't hear it from me, but the pastor is planning a Resit Regina meeting at the church tonight. Well, aren't you just a fount of knowledge? My pleasure! [Christian] Regina. The entire town is gonna stand against you. We're using the governor, the press, any possible means to stop you. We're begging you, please don't do this. Don't waste your time pleading with her, honey. We will stop this sale. And a warning, Regina, those who put greed ahead of their fellow man will trudge a rocky road ahead. Note to self: buy more comfortable shoes. [male protester] This is our town. We won't be silenced! Christian, I thought you said the governor and the press wouldn't return your calls. Yeah, I'm hoping God will forgive a little white lie until we figure out what to do. [female protester] Save our town! [melancholy music playing] -[door opens] -[bells ring] [man] Be right with you. [door bells ringing] Hello, Carl. [Carl] Regina. You look good. Oh, you too. I saw you at your dad's funeral. I looked for you afterwards. I had quite a few things to get in order at the house. I can imagine. My turn, huh? Well, we need to talk. Now, why is that never a good phrase to hear? Carl… Your doctor's looking at your chart, he looks up and says, "We need to talk." -I'd get my affairs in order. -Don't do this. Or a spouse, "We need to talk." That's guaranteed couch time. Don't make this harder than it is. Just… Just sign the deal. Why didn't you ever return my calls? You know how many unanswered letters I sent to you? After all these years, I still think about that night. Crazy, huh? People change, Carl. Not overnight. [melancholy music continues] Is, uh, that my dad's lamp? Yeah, I bought a lot of his old stuff over the years. Good excuse to go up to the house and hear the latest on what you're up to. I still have that business magazine with you on the cover somewhere. [chuckles] [strains] I've seen it… I don't know where. "Hometown Girl Makes It Big." Your dad was so damn proud of you. Must be weird being back, huh? No, I'm just here until the deal is finalized. So I've heard. I'm offering you more than this place is worth. Not interested. Carl, it's time to let go of Fullerville… for all of us. I mean, this isn't even a general store anymore.

Your father used to love to watch the lamps being lit in the Square. And what a waste of money that was. He wanted the Square surrounded by lanterns because of his favorite story, the Scottish parable of the lamplighter. Once upon a time in a village, there was an old lamplighter. And every evening, when the sun went down, he would carry his light through the streets, stopping at every lamppost along the way. ♪ Light your lamp ♪ ♪ To guide the way ♪ ♪ Lest someone should go astray ♪ ♪ Or be left standing in the dark ♪ ♪ Confused and lost with troubled hearts ♪ ♪ Let the fire of love burn bright ♪ ♪ Drive the shadows from the night ♪ ♪ Fan the flames with all your might ♪ ♪ Light your lamp ♪ -[Regina] Daddy? -♪ And spread the light ♪ [Angel] And even though he couldn't be seen in the dark, it was clear from the glow of the lamps where the lamplighter had been. ♪ Spread some light ♪ ♪ Where'er you go ♪ ♪ And always leave an afterglow ♪ ♪ Be a beacon in the night ♪ ♪ Light your lamp ♪ ♪ And spread the light ♪ ♪ May this little light of mine ♪ ♪ Cast a glow where'er it shines ♪ ♪ Light the way ♪ ♪ To brighter times ♪ ♪ Be a blessing to mankind ♪ ♪ Let this fire of love burn bright ♪ ♪ Drive the shadows from the night ♪ ♪ Fan the flames with all your might ♪ ♪ Light your lamp ♪ ♪ And spread the light ♪ Your father lit a path for you to follow.

Making the tough economic decisions that my father refused to make. Closing down businesses that were underperforming. Selling off land that was sitting vacant. They were called parks, Regina. [crowd snickers] When Cheetah Mall approached me and said they wanted to build their biggest mall in the middle of the country, I knew that this was an opportunity of a lifetime. A chance for Fullerville to enter the 21st century. That's a lie. You've been waiting on your father to die so you could swoop in and sell us off. [all] Yeah! You're just using Cheetah Mall as an excuse to cheat us all. [all] Yeah! So you believe in destroying small towns in the name of progress? She doesn't care about progress. All she cares about is money. Exactly! Even our cemetery will be torn up and destroyed by bulldozers! You're literally making everyone roll over in their graves! Yeah, and for what? Overpriced coffee and 100 movie theaters that sell sushi? Even though I like overpriced coffee and 100 movie theaters that sell sushi. [nervously] They'll never be as great as diner coffee. Come on, Regina. It's not too late. You have an opportunity tonight to just do something great. All you gotta do is change your mind. You could've made a sweet bonus. The new deadline to be out of your homes is now Christmas Eve! [all gasping] You cannot be serious. That's tomorrow night. Oh, I am serious. Believe me. Your father may be gone, but his presence lives on. We will fight against you, Regina Fuller. We will resist!

Yes, what can I get you? Um, I'm not sure. Got you, Uncle Freddy. Queen me. -[Freddy] Child, please! -Whiskey? Aren't you a little young to be bartending? I'm an old soul. BTW, FYI, my name's Violet, and I'm old enough to accept tips. Duly noted. So how come you're not at the town meeting with everybody else? I arrived late and left early. Oh. Diva. -What? -You know. That's what the divas do. They show up at parties late so they can make a big entrance. Then they leave early, so you know they're going to a more important party. I wouldn't know. I don't get invited to a lot of parties. Me either. But when I'm older, I'm gonna be the party. Where did you learn all this? I'm growing up in the back of a bar with access to the Internet. Where do you think? So your parents are at the, um, big town meeting? My dad. My mom died when I was little. Hmm. My mom died when I was little too. I talk to my mama every night. When we find the brightest star, my dad says, "That's your mama, shining down on you to light your way." He says that even if he's pointing at Venus, but I don't tell him. Sounds like you have a great dad. He is. He says he doesn't want me to grow up with "issues." Hmm, good luck with that! You're not used to talking to children, are you? I barely talked to them when I was one. Well, that's okay. I like that better than the people pinching my cheeks and talking to me like I'm a puppy. ♪ They tell little children That life is sweet with juice ♪ ♪ From that big bowl of cherries But that's just not the truth ♪ No kidding! ♪ No, it's not Guess they forgot to tell it like it is ♪ ♪ Now we know from experience There's very little bliss ♪ That's right. ♪ Life is not a fairy tale ♪ ♪ I guess it is for some, but not for us ♪ ♪ I guess we both know life too well ♪ ♪ We've seen and felt what it can do And we don't care that much ♪ ♪ For all the skins and bruises Other pains life uses ♪ ♪ To teach us lessons We have learned too well ♪ ♪ No, life is not a fairy tale ♪ ♪ Not a fairy tale ♪ I mean, if a haggy, old witch with a wart on her nose offers you an apple, then why would you eat it?

He says that's how to grow a business. Although… now it's too late. The Wickedest Witch of the Middle is throwing everybody out of town. Is that what your dad calls her? He doesn't say witch with a "W." He hates her and says she's the one who killed my mother. I'm sorry, what? Yeah. She didn't give people chances when they were a little late on their rent. So the drug store in the Square had to close. So when I was three months old, I got a bad fever. And my mom had to drive 20 miles away to get medicine. So what happened? By the time she was on her way back, a storm had blown in. She was pulled off the road into the wash. She drowned. I'm… I'm so sorry. It's not your fault. And don't tell my dad this, but I don't even blame the Wickedest Witch. If I hadn't gotten a fever, my mom would still be alive. No. -[door opens] -No! Did someone report some missing keys?

[scoffs] Felicity, the whole purpose of being an angel-in-training is to teach you how to be an angel. You've already messed up your first two tests. And dancing at the bank? My goodness! You know how this works. Good thing she doesn't cook. -[inhales] -Not the Angel Rule Book again. Oh. [ethereal tinkling] Rule 14, subsection F: "Until you get your assigned human to change their heart and, subsequently, have their hearts change their mind, the status of 'angel' shall not be conferred." I only skimmed the subsection. Felicity, Regina and all of Fullerville need you. Right! -If I could have just one more minute-- -Will you get out there and do your job! [sighs] Lord, she is such a pain! [snoring] -Regina, are you dead? -[gasps] [deeply exhales] If I were dead, would you expect me to answer? [whispers] Sorry. [breathing heavily] Just used to seeing you sleep horizontally. Why are you on the couch? It was a rough night. Oh… Impending medical tests are always frightening. You have no idea what I am going through, so you may wanna keep your ever-appropriate, Felicity-incessant chatter to yourself until I call for group participation, or at least until you get me a cup of coffee. -Sorry, I was just-- -Getting me coffee? Yes, yes, coffee. And we should leave soon so that we can make it to the hospital on time. Oh yes, we must hurry to the hospital to speed up the news of my impending death. And the town can begin their celebration. You are kinda putting them in a tough spot, but it's Christmas, so, you know, maybe-- If I want your opinion, I will ask for it. Right. I just want you to know, Regina, I am always here for you. Of course you are. That's what I pay you for. Now get me my coffee. -Regina, I'm just trying-- -If you want a friend, get a dog! That's it! That's it! I am through! I am done with this! Where do you think you're going? And don't lie. You know I can read your mind. [exhales] I quit! If you quit, you're no better than she is. What? Uh, she is rude, dismissive and condescending. And don't get me started on her bad qualities. Well, you have to look past her flaws, Felicity.

[Angel] ♪ Looking at life in the rearview mirror ♪ [Regina] I was so in love with him. [Felicity] Is this where you went to high school? [Regina] Yeah. It's also where I went to my first and only dance. My father let me go because it was a Christmas dance. All the other girls had been going to dances for years.

That ring was meant for me. But… [sighs] I could never look Carl in the eye again. By the time I had the baby, the father had moved on to another girl and… another town.

I got as far away from him and this town as I possibly could. But there's something you didn't see. I know the most important thing is that Regina never feels ashamed. Small towns have long memories. I want her to have a fresh start. But how do I let this child, my grandchild, be taken from us? [baby cooing] I don't know if she'll ever forgive me. [crying] All you saw was the darkness.

I know this is hard, but she's a tough little girl. -She'll pull through. -How could you know what I'm feeling? You have no idea what it would be like to lose a child. -Yes, I do. -Get her into Trauma One. We're doing all we can to locate a pediatric head trauma specialist. Mack knows you meant well, Regina. It's just the worry talking. Listen, get on the phone and find the top pediatric neurosurgeon in the country and get them here. -Like, pick them up? -Yes. Get them in a helicopter or private plane. I don't care how much it costs. Just get them here now. -Any news? Any news? -Dr. Marshall just took her into trauma. Oh, Lord, let this doctor help Violet. [man] That pile-up blocked the street.

It's about a young girl… a young girl that was with child. And many years ago… You know that many years ago, they would not even accept her in her own town. So… the baby was given up for adoption. I was that baby. [all gasps] And tonight, on the holiest of nights, I had the pleasure… of meeting my birth mother. Please welcome my mother… Regina Fuller. [all gasping] [indistinct chatter] -Regina. -Regina? Regina! Well, Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night. I knew it all along.

I grew up… wanting to treasure my father's legacy and his dreams for this wonderful town, but… then… life… and death happened. And, um… Well, as my oldest friend can attest, I… I became very mean. -It's okay, baby.
