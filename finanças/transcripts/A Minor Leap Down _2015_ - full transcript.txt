A Minor Leap Down Cast Negar Javaherian, Rambod Javan Writer and Director Hamed Rajabi Ms. Ahmadi, you can go in now. My husband wants a boy. I'm due in two months. Congratulations! You're not scared? Hi. Hi. You're pregnant? Yeah. How far along? When is your baby due? My baby's dead. The doctor just told me... dead. Did you hear that? Yeah. Her baby's dead. Why? Doctor, could you come here a moment? Why are you still here? Go home, dear. Get up, my dear... Calm yourself. What's happened Doctor? Nothing. It's nothing. Try to be calm. Go home. Come back in two days for the abortion. It's not good for you... Cry... Cry so you'll feel better. You'll feel better if you cry. Is he alright Doctor? It's fine. Don't worry. It's nothing. It's frightening. Hi. Can you come see me? No... I just wanted to see you. That's all... No, nothing... I know... If you could come after work, it would be great. No, No, nothing wrong. I'll see you. Bye. Are you leaving? Are you pulling out? Your Mom's in the kitchen. What's new? Nothing. I was just asking Simin about you... You know how long it's been since I last saw you? Hi. Hi Nahal. How's your husband? He's fine. Thank you. Why weren't you answering your cell this morning? It was on silent. Mona isn't home? No, she's at the university. Your well? We will see you tonight, right? Huh? Our get-togethers: tonight's your mom's turn. I see. Come over a bit sooner, so we can see you more. OK. Mom! Mom... What is it, sweetheart? Come here a minute. I want to talk to you. - What is it darling? - Come here... Come here... sit. Tell me...what is it? Nothing. I just wanted to talk to you. Tell me then. I have tons of work. What is it? Are you O.K.? Yeah. You really need to take. Care of yourself, you know. Don't you want to tell us, Nahal? About what? Is it a boy or a girl? She doesn't want to find out beforehand. - Well, congratulations. - We're really happy for you. I'm leaving. But where? What did you want to say? I'll come see you. Do you have the car? Me? Yeah. Could you get these things for me? OK. - Don't be late! - OK. Mom... Yes, I bought the things. I left them on the step. Come take them. No, I can't. I don't think I will. Sure. Bye. What's going on, Negar? I have been waiting here for 20 minutes. When will he leave? Don't laugh! How could I know? OK. No. I can't. No. No. I just wanted to see you. I'll see you later. OK. Maybe I'll come back. How are you? I'm fine. Rezayi has given up on work since they're going to promote him... He knows he's bagged it. He has enough connections not to worry about slacking. I'm doing all his work. But, Anoush, my friend, keeps trying to take up some of Rezayi's work. But I'm careful, I don't let him get too involved. The CEO's people will notice who's holding this place together. This way, I'll end up the head of all storage facilities. Asshole! Who licenses these guys? But I have to be more visible. They need to see who's managing the work. That's good, right? Yes. But I shouldn't push it too far either... It could backfire... What did you call about earlier? Nothing. I missed you. These days I'm handling two people's load. It's a pain but it's worth it. If it works out, they'll upgrade my salary to a supervisor's. It's two or three hundred thousands extra, plus better benefits. We'll be doing better. Are you happy? Very. It's a really quiet building. And the owner doesn't show up from one year to the next. He rents out a bunch of apartments. Did you see the faucet? It's imported. Imported? Of course. It's imported. How's the kitchen? It's fine. It's really quiet. You can sleep all day. No one has kids. Will he give a discount? He won't go below 2 million for rent. Nahal! See, this one has a closet, but the other room doesn't... See... It's a wonderful building. If he would rent to single people, it would have been rented by now. But this one's bigger. Which one's better for the kid's room? Your kid can play With other kids in the backyard They are quiet kids. How old is your kid? Is the parking underground? I think it's street-level. It's written in the deed. Everything is perfect. What matters is that the lady likes the kitchen. Could you wait outside for a minute? Yes. What is it? Nothing. She's gotten a bit old. Her earlier songs were better. Are you OK? No. What's wrong again? Turn that down. But you've been doing so well these past few months. Take a look at yourself. You're doing really well. I'm not well. Have you talked to it today? You should talk to the baby a few times a day. It's like taking pills. It will upset the baby. Take one of your deep breaths. It's good for both of you. You worry me with your words. Don't worry. Why did you lock the door? I want to be alone. Nahal... Open the door. I'm fine Babak. Don't worry. Goodnight. Sure? Yes. - Good morning. - Good morning. You couldn't sleep again? I made breakfast. I'm sleepy. Hello. I have a question... How long can a person keep a dead baby? No, I mean how long can a dead fetus be kept the womb? No, I'm not asking for me, it's for a friend of mine. At what point does it become dangerous? What's the worst case scenario? I don't know. She just wants to... What are the sighs? How about painkillers? What do you prescribe as painkiller? But that's your job... to advise If someone wants to keep this "foreign object" in her body. Hi. No. I'm fine. I am. No. No, Babak. I won't go to the psychiatrist. No, don't talk to dad. OK. OK. What time? See you. Bye. I'm worried about you, Nahal. I love you. What are you scared of? You're not supposed to go on the pills again. Just let her see you. Why should we go to the doctor? Because if I'm fine, then you're depressed. If you're fine... then everyone is just too happy, which is impossible. Ask anyone, they'll tell you the same thing. Who can convince you that you are depressed? Want to pick up a random stranger and ask him? We'll describe the whole thing. You have to believe someone. How about this guy? Choose anyone you want and ask him if you need a psychiatrist or not. Are you coming to the doctor or should I give him a ride? I'm fine. I don't want to take pills anymore. I also prefer not to prescribe you any until after your pregnancy. So what are you worried about? I'm worried about after my pregnancy. Once your baby comes out, everything will be fine. I promise you. Don't you remember how fine you were when you were taking the pills? I wasn't well. I had just forgotten that I feet bad. What's the good in remembering that you don't feel well? This is life. It can't be changed. You have to get along with it. Do you sleep well? How's your appetite? We shouldn't let your depression come back. We have to stop it early on. You're depressed, too, aren't you? We're talking about you right now. Why are you depressed? Which pills are you taking? Citalopram? Amitriptyline? - Why are you not OK? - Nahal! Look dear, maybe I'm on medication, maybe I'm not. But that doesn't change anything about your situation. You take medicine everyday to sit here and smile at people? Why do you think you have to keep smiling if you're not well? Excuse me. Here. Go shopping a little. You'll feel better. I won't. Stop it, please. You know what, you are O.K. We shouldn't have come here. Everything has changed since you got pregnant. The doctor said everything will be fine once the baby's born. I'm happy enough for me, Babak. I'm happy enough for my life. No more and no less. Why don't you talk to me? What's wrong for God sake? Because you can't bear it. Because you keep saying that if everyone on a highway is driving toward me, then I'm going the wrong way. It's never occurred to you that maybe it's everyone else who's driving the wrong way. Maybe I don't understand your happiness either, but I've never tried to convince you that you're too happy. I don't force you to see a doctor to become like me. I want to go to the central office. Will you take me? Yes. I love you. I love our life. I would do anything for you. You should do some things for my sake, too, no? What did we have when we staffed out? I couldn't done it without you. You couldn't without me either. But look at us now. We have built so much together. What have we built? Many things. This, for instance. How is it? I want to buy it. It belongs to Mazaherl, in PR. We will swap cars and I'll pay the balance in four months. Happy? I wanted to tell you after having bought it. I'll give him our car tonight. Tomorrow we will sign on it Don't we have enough loan payments already? Two of them are nearly paid off. Loans put you ahead. And you could take the booklet translation job. I want to give the car to Mona. She would travel with her friends. I've told you a thousand times I don't like to lend my car to anyone. Anyway, I have to give the car to Mazaheri tonight. You can't give it to Mona. You're pregnant. You should take care of yourself. Go shopping. - Hello. - Hello. Hi. I've been waiting for an hour. You don't even answer your cell. Where are the translations? I didn't have time. Take them somewhere else. No way! I have an embassy appointment today. - Haven't you translated them? - No. - Are you kidding me? - It's no problem, sir. Translate them right away. I can't. Give them to someone else. - What are they? - Identification & employment papers. Do this translation right now. We can talk later. - I can't. - Why not? My stomach hurts. Bye, Mina. - Hey, where are you going?! - Bye. Where can I find a French translator right now? What's going on here? - If you leave, don't come back! - I won't. - Who will do my work? - Please don't worry. We'll find a way. How much is this one? 1.5 million. And this one? They are all in the same range. We have nothing under a million. Which one is the most expensive? That one. How much is it? 4.7 million. Bring it! - Look, if you just want to try it on... - Take it out. Bring that dress for the lady. Sorry if I was a little... People often come here just to try the dresses on and then nothing. Are you the owner? No, I'm a salesman. You could try it on in there, Ms. No need. I'll take it. How much was the most expensive cloth you've ever bought yourself? Ever worn a 1.5-million shirt? Anything else? No. The code is 2852. - Hi. - How are you? Hello... Hi. - I'm fine. - Sit down. I'm busy, just wanted to talk to you for a minute. Sit down a minute. You just got here, there's no rush. Guys, this is Nahal, my sister. Amir, Sara, Arash and you already know Farid. Yes. No need for that smile. We're regular friends now. - They're "just friends" how. - Quite European. - They've come to their senses. - What the hell? We saw how you were with Maryam. I wasn't carried away like you guys. - She was carried away? - She wasn't? I was always sure she'd leaver me the next day. Idiot! That's her style. She did leave me in the end. That s all there is, in the end. - Is she like this at home too? - Like what? I never understood what's going on in her head. - Suppose you did. - It matters. He wants to keep up. He went out with Noushin like the next day. Alright, all is well that ends well. At least he doesn't have to walk Mona home every night. Now he has to walk Noushin home every night. No. Noushin has a car. He just walks her to her car. Ah. She's a catch then. Yup. You've definitely scored there. Guys, Nahal is looking at us like our UFO just handed. We scared her. She'd look at us like that anyway. She's one of the "well-behaved". Well-behaved? - What year were you born? - 1983. Didn't they keep telling you to sit up straight? To be polite... Aren't you well-behaved now? Don't worry about it. I met a '98 yesterday. It blew my mind. I felt sick. I know how you feel. Ok, Grandpa! How does one get a cup of tea here? Ehsan! Ehsan! He's not there. See, there are two ways. Either I squeeze my way out, of if you don't mind you grab yourself a cup. Told you they're well-behaved. I'll call you later. Bye. Hi. Hi. Have you been here before? No. Will you come back? No. I don't know. Are you sure? Yes. Then let me show you something. Look! If they see it, they'll say it's dirty and will get us sick and all that. But I want to keep it. Touch it. Do you want tea? Yeah! Guys, I'm going. Mona, could you come a second? What happened? Nothing. Are you O.K.? Yeah. Here. Just be careful, OK? No, there's no need. We're not going. - Why not? - No reason... it got cancelled. - Did Babak call you? - Nah! OK. Go back inside. Go! - Bye. - Bye. Hi. What did you do? I bet you were parked and someone ran into your car. Doesn't everyone say that? We like to see you often, but not because of accidents. Are you in a rush? It has to stay a couple of days. Or you can take it and bring it back in a day or two. - Hi. - Hi. It's a good accident. Accidents aren't good or bad. It could've been worse. Even if the car was totaled you'd say the same thing. Sure. It could always be worse. Couldn't it? Yes, it could. These guys are still young. They don't know anything. How much older do you think she is? Maybe I'll go to Negar's place. No. Yes, I went shopping. A dress Yes, it's beautiful. 4.7 million. Bye. - Say: Spring. - Spring. - Summer. - Summer. - Fall. - Fall. - Winter. - Winter. Now say them all. "Splint" Summer. No! Fall, winter. Winter. Bravo! Which one's better. I don't know. Which one's better for today? They're both fine. The way you say it, it's as if they're the same shit. What's the difference? Of course there's a difference, darling. Why you don't pick up your phone? It's Babak. If it's Babak, I'm not here. He knows I was going to come over. Hello? No, She's not here. She was, but she left. I'm going out, actually. OK. Come in. He's coming up. It's not my fault. He kept insisting. Tell him I'm not here. OK. Negar! My shoes. - Hi. - Hi. Sorry to bother you. No problem. How are you? Fine. Could I come in? OK, but I'm leaving. Just for a minute. OK, come in. When did Nahal leave? About half-an-hour ago She doesn't answer my calls. She didn't say anything? No, she didn't. I was supposed to sell my car tonight. I'm buying a Peugeot. That's nice. It's all up in the air now. Nahal crashed the car today. She didn't mention it. She bought a dress of four million. Can you believe it? I don't know what's up with her this time. She didn't use to act like this. She seemed fine. Seems some people get sick of not having any problems. Come more often. Nahal is always happy to see you. We see each other pretty often. Yeah. I know. She likes seeing you. In any case, visiting one another is... could be helpful. Hi. Do you like the smell? What is all this? Do you know that Babak likes you? Nahal! - Babak has never done anything to... - I know. Because he's a coward. He forces his way up and talks about me and looks you up and down and leaves. Nahal, what's wrong? Let's go. If I walk out of Babak's life, would you be willing to live with him? Say it. What are you worried about? No. Why? Because he's too ordinary. Thank you. I'm sorry it went like this. Give me the mechanic's address. - I won't be ready today. - We're going to take the car. Hello. Hi. We want to take the car. Could you bring the keys? We've already ordered the bumper. It will be ready tomorrow. Hello. I knew you'd miss us, but so soon? Hello. Dad! Could you bring the keys for the car? Careful not to get fined. OK. Thank you. Be well. Goodbye. So long. Thank you, guys. Sorry about this. Bye. Wait! Go back. Go... go. Come. Come. Enough. Turn it all the way. Go. Go back. More, more. Turn it, turn it. OK. Stop. Go back. Come. Come. Don't be afraid. It's fine. Come straight. OK. They're good guys. They're mountaineers. Their father was a mountaineer too. Wish you climbing with them on weekends? Thanks. No problem. Guys, would you mind if Babak comes climbing with you? Sure. - Bye. - Bye. No, we're not home yet. No. We will be there in half-an-hour. OK. They can come over. OK. Goodbye. We have visits for the apartment. - How much are the building fees? - 50.000. Newlyweds? Not yet. We're getting married next week. So it's your first home. Would you give us a discount on the rent? No. I need the money. Aren't there too few cabinets? Do you have enough dishes to fill these? Well, no. Has he told you not to praise the place? Come here. My husband is tired. I'll show you the place. The bedroom is OK, it's just a little small. Once you've put a bed, there is no room for anything else. But anyway, it's a bedroom. What else do you want to do there? The water isn't always hot. It's either cold or lukewarm. Sometimes when you're showering, it cuts off altogether. There are 84 steps. Babak has counted. Always, on the way up, the old woman at number 6 observes you from the peephole. But you guys are married, so that shouldn't be a problem. Don't invite too many guests. Four or five people: it's small. And you can hear all the sounds from the unit next door. Which means they can hear all your sounds, too. Be careful. But you could do it differently. You could make as much noise, invite as many guests as you'd like. And every time you're coming up, you could smile at the old lady at number 6. Let her watch you. And every time the water goes off in the shower, just wait until it comes back. Nahal! OK. I'll be in touch with the realtor. Goodbye. Goodbye. How is it? Why are you doing all this? I told you you can't bear it. Well? Why are you quiet? Talk... You can't talk to me? Then pretend I'm your aunt. You can tell your aunt what's wrong, can't you? Tell her. Maybe she will understand. There's nothing with me. I'm fine. How are you fine? When everyone says you're not well, what makes you think you are? Your aunt can't get it either? Pretend I'm uncle Sahand. Convince me you're fine. You can't talk to him either? Because he says you should listen to the doctor and take the pills? And stop torment yourself and the others? O.K., then imagine I'm Samira. You can talk to a girl of your age, can't you? Let me be. Why should I let you be? When you're not feeling well, why should I leave you alone? I'm worried about you. I'm a girl your age. And my life isn't as nice as yours. But I'm fine. What's going on with you? You think I'm just clowning around? Do you want me to invite them all here so you can ask them? If any of them were sitting in front of you, they'd say the same things. And they say much worse behind your back. Don't lock the door. The check is dated for two days from now. If it's not cashed, then the contract is nulled, correct? Of course. I've put it in the contract. - Have you determined a penalty, too? - Yes. Ms., I take these things seriously. If your check doesn't go through, I will charge you the full penalty. That's fine. This gentleman says you have a few apartments that you rent. That's correct. My husband says that one has to invest all his money in property. Yes, he is right. He wants to be like you eventually. Are you satisfied with your life? Please sign here. Hi Mom... No, nothing's wrong. I want to throw a party tonight. Yes, I want to make it up to Babak. I signed on the new apartment today. I want to throw a party. No, nothing. Just don't tell Babak, I want to surprise him. I'll invite a few other people. OK. I'll text you the new address. No, I don't need any help. See you soon. Bye. No, Thank you. I'll have one. Thank you. Thanks, I still have mine, too. Thanks. Juice? Thank you very much. So, Nahal, don't you want to tell us what's happening? Nothing. Would you like some orange juice? It's dinnertime, no? Dinner? Here? Are you kidding? Then why did you invite us? Didn't you want to see my new place? Thank you. So what's your surprise, Nahal? The new home. You aren't surprised? - What's all this about? - Is this a joke? We don't mind but you have to respect at least these old people. I just wanted to get together. When you get a new home you should throw a party, no? Nahal! What's going on? Nothing, I'm serving the guests. What kind of service is this, darling? What? You don't like juice? You've invited us to serve us juice? You don't like it? - We've come here for nothing. - What are we doing here anyhow? Are you feeling well? Why do you ask? No reason. Just asking. I feel hot. You're right. It's gotten really got. Juice? What is she doing? Nahal, tell us for God?s sake if you laced the juices. No. Why? Does it taste weird? What are you saying? Why have we been invited then? What kind of party is this where we are only served juice? I can't keep standing up anymore. She's right. I can't stand up anymore either. Don't worry. You are standing a lot, you know. The AC doesn't work either. Don't walk around too much. It's best to sit somewhere on the floor. - What for? - Nothing. You can leave if you're uncomfortable. Where is Babak? He's at work. He's on his way. I called him. - When's your dad coming? - He's not. Why isn't Mona here? I didn?t invite her. You're not drinking? Why not? I don't like orange juice. Drink some, too. Do you feel better now? What have you done, Nahal? Nothing. Tell them you haven't put anything in the juice. I haven't put anything in the juice. Call an ambulance. Let's see what she's put in this. Who cares! Just call it! She drank some, too. Now what? You think you can do whatever you want? Forget her... Come with me. Nahal, please, if you have put something in there, tell us. Well? Tell us! I told you. Why do you think I have laced them? What have we ever done to you? What have I ever done to you? Did you call her dad? I called him. He's on his way. Gag! Try to throw up! I can't. What is it Samira? You don't feel well? It's not that... I don't know. Look at me: there is nothing in the juice. Samira... Look what your wife's done to us... Look at the mess she's made. I don't know what to do with her. Do something! What have you done? Nothing. Have you laced the juice? No. Nothing. There's nothing in the juice. It's perfectly fine. There's nothing. It's fine. Nothing. Nothing. Don't you want to stop this? Don't you want to stop? Don't you want to stop? Don't you want to stop? Don't you? Don't you want to stop? No, I don't want that... I just want to be alone here for a while. No, Babak! Leave me alone! I just want to be alone. That's all I want. Why don't you listen to me? Leave me alone for how. Go on a trip... Babak! Nahal, why are you doing this? That baby is dead. I know... I just want to be alone with it. Can't I? For how long? Your doctor said it's dangerous for you... you will die. Leave me alone, Babak. It is dead. It's rotting inside you. It's my own business! Don't yell. Speak on the phone. It's my own business! Nahalf! Why are you doing this to me, darling? Open this door. Let me just see you. I promise to do anything... Nahal... darling... Babak, what are you doing? Step away from the door. - Babak, don't do this! - Step away, I said! Don't, Babak. Don't do it. - Nahal. - Babak, don't! Hello. Hello. How long have you been here? Thirty-two hours. Your pain's going to increase little by little. Your body should expel it anytime now... Don't worry. I've prescribed you some medicine. It should help. Congratulations! You give it to her. Yes. Yes... Come over then... Sure... He's beautiful. She's doing well, too. OK... I'm waiting... Bye. Bye. When is your baby due? My baby's dead.
