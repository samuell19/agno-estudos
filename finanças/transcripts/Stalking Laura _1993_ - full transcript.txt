The following is based on a true story. Chloe! Come here, Chloe. Come here, Chloe. Hi. Hey, listen. You won't get cherry pie like this in California. Ugh, dad. Give her a break, dad. Hey, what'd I say? You're impossible. She was hired over a group of a 100 graduates. So, she could change her mind. It's not too late. Let her go it was just a wonderful opportunity you know that. Oh, okay, Laura, what do I have to do? Dad, where did all this come from? Come on it's a chance of a lifetime. I can't even believe they offered me the job. You can get a good job right here in Virginia. Oh, stop. The Silicon Valley is the major leagues. And Kensitron is the best. You always told me to go for the best. I said that? Tom. Uh-huh. I'm gonna miss you baby. I'll miss you too, dad. I'll be all right. - Bye. - Bye, bye. Love you. Oh, yeah. Now this is where you'll be doing most of your work. Most that is except for when you're testing your designs which, of course, you'll do in a secure area. Which reminds me I'll have to start putting you in for security clearance. All right. Now this is gonna be your work station right here. You wear your badge above your waist at all times. - Okay. - Now, they're colored coded. You work your way up to gold, and this entire toy store is open up to you. All right. - Chris? - Yeah, come on. I think we've done it. We've got the clock rate up to 20 megahertz with no sign of failure. Excuse me. I didn't mean to bust in. No, that's okay. Rich, this is Laura Black. Laura is one of our new design engineers. She's gonna be working over in signal processing. Hi, Rich, nice to meet you. Hi. Well, we were just getting ready to get a bite to eat. You wanna come with us? That sounds good. Okay. Yeah, it's great. Hey, look you like softball? - Mm-hmm. - Good. WW got a great softball team. First thing you're gonna learn about KEI is we're like one big family. A dysfunctional family. Anyway, Laura didn't come to KEI to play softball. Did you find an apartment yet? No, I was thinking about sharing. Well, then you ought to try to get a hold of a copy of our award-winning company newsletter. You'll find riveting coverage of last month's pancake breakfast. And they have ads for roommates in the back. Thanks, I'll check it out. I'll catch up with you guys. - You too. - Hey. We are talking serious truck here. For skiing, I bought it for the snow. You like to ski? I love skiing. I hear that just a couple of hours from where we are some of the best there is. Yeah. Have you ever been to a tractor pull? No, I can't say I have. I know it sounds weird. But they're really a whole lot of fun. There's gonna be one on Saturday at the fairgrounds, and I just happen to have a couple of tickets. You wanna go with me? Sorry, but I couldn't. I know we just met. But you'd be in good hands with me. I have high-level security clearance. America trusts me, so can you. Thanks, but I really can't go. Yeah. Alright, ready to go. Okay. Back to the salt mine. Sauna, gym, jacuzzi, pool, rec room with wet bar, half a dozen other amenities you're probably never gonna use. So why would you wanna move to Sunnyvale anyway? Well, I just graduated UC Davis, and now I'm working as an engineer at KEI. - Engineering? - Uh-huh. Wow, tell me what was the ratio of guys to girls there? I don't know 10 to one. Incredible I made the mistake with art history. 12 guys my entire major half of whom were gay, so. Is that right, huh? So you're from New York? You can tell? I'm from Soho. I paint. Why fire escapes? I happen to like them. I sold quite a few of those in my time. Well, that must be quite a leap, huh, Soho to the Silicon Valley? Yeah, well, believe it or not I don't have a trust fund. So what's your work deal? Well, my job's got a three-month probation period. That's all I can commit to in terms of rent. Well, if you can compete in engineering school and get a job at KEI, I'll bet on you. How long is it gonna take you to get your stuff here? Can you open this door for me? Oh, thank you. I'm sorry, I'm new. I didn't know this door would be locked. Oh, they open it at eight. I'm just trying to get in early to get myself together. I should've realized everything around here is security. I'm Glenda Moritz. I work in accounting. Nice to meet you. - I'm Laura Black. - Laura Black. Yeah, I know. I've got you right here, welcome. Well, thanks for letting me in. If I can do anything for you, - Glenda. - You can. - First base? - Excuse me. We need a first baseman for the softball team. Deal. Thanks. - Rich. - Smell something good? How'd you get in? Fresh baked blueberry bread made it myself. Rich, it's seven o'clock in the morning. What are you doing here so early? I couldn't sleep when I can't sleep, I work on my computer or I bake. You wanna know my secret? Lemon zest it brings it all together. Here, enjoy.

I'm busy on Sunday. Okay, we'll forget about the concert. What about dinner Saturday night? Look, I just really don't think it's a good idea. It's gonna be real hard for us to have a relationship if you keep refusing to go out with me. Rich, the only relationship that we're gonna have is a professional one in the office. I don't think it's a good idea to wear such a sexy looking top in public. It might give people the wrong impression. Come on! Come on! Go we need a hit! Alright, alright come on field! Give us a hit baby! Okay, Laura, you're up to bat. Alright, okay. Alright, yeah, come on now you can do it! Do it. - Laura. - What? Laura, I've been thinking about the terms of our relationship. - What? - I know this isn't a good time now, but I thought after the game maybe we should go out and discuss it then? No, Rich. How do I make myself clear? We are not having a relationship. I am not going out with you. What's it gonna take for you to get it? You're not gonna use that aluminum bat are you? You're never gonna get a hit with that one. Hey, come on, Laura, play ball. - No, private coach. - Come on, Laura. Come on make us look good, Laura! Laura, You can do it, yeah! You can do it, babe, we're behind you. We're with you, Laura! Strike one. It's not too late to change bats, Laura. That's okay we're all right here for you, Laura. Strike two. That's the wrong bat for you. I know what I'm talking about. You should use a wooden one. Give it all you got! Safe. Way to go, Laura. Alright, now they're two outs, so just one on anything. Strike one. You know, if he's giving you a problem, you really ought to take it up with management. It's okay, Glenda, I can handle him. Well, you keep giving him those looks, and he's not gone bake you anymore blueberry bread. That's exactly what I'm hoping for. - Phyllis. - Hmm-mm. - Hi. - Hi. That new engineering, Chris' group, Laura Black one of the techs overheard that she has a birthday coming up, and we were thinking about having a little party. So, could you find me her exact birthday? Oh, sure. Thank you. There we go. Looks like your tech overheard wrong. Her birthday isn't till January. Well, that's weird. Thanks anyway, Phyllis. Sure. Laura. This is for you. I don't want your gifts. I don't really care what you want after the way you were acting yesterday. What are you talking about? You were making faces at me. Don't think I didn't see you, childish, silly, faces, and that's why you're getting this. Go on open it. I'm not gonna leave until you open it. If you're gonna act like a child, I'm gonna have to treat you like a child. Here's a letter. Read it. So, until I can ask you out nicely and have you say yes, I'll be around. I promise. If you really wanna get rid of me, you're gonna have to bite the bullet and let me take you out a few times. If we just argue and fight, then I'll leave you alone for good. What are you gonna do about this guy, Laura? Well, I'm not inviting him to the company picnic if that's what you mean. Earth to, Laura. This a man on the edge. You gotta tell your boss. I work with 60 guys. I am the only woman in my department. There are people just waiting for me to pick up my dolls and go home. I've always done things on my own. I can handle this guy. What are you gonna do sit him down and have a chat with him? I mean, this is not a person that you can reason with. I refuse to be his victim. I'm not gonna give him that power. You don't get it. Anything you say to a guy like this is like trouble. I mean, you can't even make eye contact with him. Do you like tofu? Hmm? Laura, this is like trying to talk to the geniuses I work with. I'm serious what are you gonna do? I'm gonna toss the tofu in the salad, and we are going to have dinner. I couldn't believe it this is supposed to be like the number one team in the league, right? Their third baseman, my god, it was like he was asleep. What about the pitcher though? I mean, he tried to but to the back and his slow pitch. - I know. - But you know what it was the infield. The infield was cooking. That's it defense is the name of the game. All the way. I think your offense overwhelmed them too, Laura. What were you four for five? Can I have a refill, Glenda? Thank you. Anybody, hungry? Let's put an order in. - Yes, yes. - I'm starving. I'll have a number 24 please. Number 26, the turkey and ham with cheese, is their best. Right, okay, anything for anybody else? I'll have a number 29. Thank you. Ooh, buddy, buddy, buddy. Okay, everybody got some. To us. And people like us. Whoo! - All right. - Say it again. Now we gotta keep this up. Right I'll believe it when I see it. No problem. $300 for an alternator and a new battery. What is an alternator anyway? Well, the alternator powers the electrical system. It recharges the battery. - So if you don't have... - Give me subways. Give me taxis. Give me buses. I mean $300 is a lot of cab fare. Oh, my god. See you there. I spoke to Chris a while ago. He told me you were gonna be late on account of somebody slashed your tires last night. That's terrible, Laura. - I feel awful. - Yeah, I bet you do, Rich. Well, you must live in a dangerous neighborhood. Either that, or someone's trying to make you pay attention. Nobody makes me do anything I don't want to. I called the police and they're investigating. Without any witnesses there's really not much they can do. Didn't they tell you that? They advised me to get a restraining order against you. Listen, Laura, I don't ever wanna see any cops around me. Things would just get out of hand. It would be a mistake. So have you given any thought to how you're gonna replace your tires? Pep Boys is having a sale. I could go with you to pick them out. You could put them on my charge if you want. You think about it. Let me know. Laura, we all know engineers can be a bit eccentric. But Richard Farley is one of the most highly regarded employees we have. He's been here for over nine years. Have you had a relationship with him outside KEI? No, of course not. One night he was waiting outside my aerobics class, and then again he showed up at my apartment and gave me a gift. What sort of a gift? It was a toy. He said it was because I was acting childish at the company softball game by making faces at him. Did you make faces at him? I don't know he was annoying me. Yeah, maybe I made faces at him, so what? And that was the only contact you had with him outside of work? Yes. Except I did have lunch with him my first day here. But that's all. Look it wasn't a date. Chris, my supervisor asked me if I wanted to go to lunch and Farley happened to be there, so he came along. Everybody paid for their own meal. It was my first day. I had just met him. What? Do you always smile at people that way? Left side and one. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. She's the best instructor around here. You are not supposed to be in here. Penny had a talk with me. She told me to stay away from you at work. But they can't tell me what to do on my own time. ♪ I've been waiting for someone just like you to keep me ♪ ♪ Captured ♪ ♪ Captured ♪ ♪ Captured taken in ♪ Rich. This is gonna be fabulous. Well, you wanted closet space, and closest space is what you're gonna get. You're the best. Tenant of the year. I was tearing out the old closest and look what I found. I thought I lost these. I was thinking maybe you and Laura and I could go to Tahoe this year. She loves to ski, you know. Yeah, sure. Rich, I know you have a thing for Laura. It's no secret. The whole company knows. Can I give you some advice? She's not interested. Why do you wanna force this? Hi, Love. It's 2:30 a.m., and I'm writing you this. That means that I'm bored and can't sleep. I've been awake thinking for the last two hours. I watched you a little on Friday. Oh, god, you're lovely. I love it when you try to ignore me because there's no way. You're just as aware of me when I'm around as I am of you when you're around. Would you believe that I really hate upsetting you? So, I think, I'll start by apologizing. Sometimes I admit I think of you sexually. But I spend a lot more time trying to understand what you say, what you do, why you won't do things with me. I've been told over and over again I should stop wasting my time with you. They just don't understand the hold you have on me. Hey, Laura. I bet you get gas mileage with this. You know, I'm feeling kind of hungry, and I was wondering if maybe you wanted to go out and have a bite right now? I'm tired and I wish you'd please just leave me alone. If we could just talk about this. I don't feel like talking about anything. I just want you to stop bothering me. She's my girlfriend! I am not his girlfriend! She gets like this sometimes. She's got quite a temper. But it doesn't mean anything at all. Just a lover's quarrel. You know how it is. Laura, where are you going? I just wanna talk! What? I can't stay here anymore. We'll get a new apartment something with really great security. No, this is my problem. I can't do this to you. I've gotta move. What and leave me alone with this guy. I'm moving with you, okay? There's something about iron gates I've really come to like. It's sort of like fire escapes. This is either the most secure apartment complex or the fanciest prison. Rich, could I interest you in some anchovy pizza? Oh, no, thanks very much. Rich, I don't want guns in the house. I told you that when you rented the place. They're not loaded. I don't care my daughter has her friends over. I want them out of here. I mean it, Rich! I'll take care of it. When? I wanna know, Rich! I said I'd take care of it, Nancy. Goodnight, Chris. Is it six o'clock already? No, I had to adjust my hours, so I could leave early and avoid certain people, remember? Right. Listen, Laura, about that application for the level five security clearance when do I get that back? I am working on it, but it is torture. They wanna know everything. Hey, when you work for Defense, big brother has to know everything about you. So you get through with that, right? Because you're not going to get a promotion without a clearance ticket. I'll get it done. Alright, thanks. - Alright, see you tomorrow. - Bye. New apartment's must nicer, more private, but I'll bet you pay a lot more too. I'm calling the police. I don't think that's a good idea. You know the holidays are just around the corner, and you haven't even sent me a Christmas card. How long did you think it would take before I found out where your new place is? Are your two sisters as sneaky as you are? Your little sister Sarah is at Oregon State and your older sister Bonnie is a nurse in Newport Beach, right? Oh, my god. I even know about the time that you tried marijuana in high school, and if we're gonna have a relationship, you're gonna have to promise me right now that you will never do drugs again. Stop it, stop it. If you try to run, I'll go after one of your sisters. Maybe even your mother. What is it? How far are you gonna push this? What do you want? You wanna kill me? You wanna rape me? You and I were meant for each other, Laura. Why me? Just tell me why me? All I know is you and I were meant to be together forever. You're sick, you're sick. ♪ Gloria ♪ ♪ Hosanna ♪ Oh, no. That's the one grandma made for you. I'll clean it up. Hey, maybe it can be glued? Well, it can't. Why are you making such a big deal out of it? What's your problem? Package for you, Laura. It's from California. You have a boyfriend you haven't told us about? No, I don't. Oh, god. No. I've complained for six months now. They just don't hear me. Sometimes I get the feeling they think I'm responsible somehow. The woman in personnel said, "Maybe this happened "because I smiled at him too much." This is ridiculous. Look maybe I should go out there. Dad, that's the last thing I want. Laura, you're a talented girl. You could go to work someplace else. I can't do that. Why? You know I have worked hard all my life to get this. I'm doing everything I've always dreamed off. I like it. I can't change my life because of him. If I do that, I'm his victim. It's like he's won. I'll go back to them, dad. I'll make them listen to me. I promise. We're trying to do something about this Laura. It's a complex situation. You've got his letters. You've got witnesses. What more do you need? Look it's getting in the way of doing my job. We don't wanna jeopardize Richard's security clearance. I can restrict his access to keep him away from you, and we can offer counseling to him in a program called Project Concern. Project Concern he won't go. He'll either go on be fired. It's something I'd like to make available to you too. I don't counseling. All I need is for him to leave me alone. I understand. Does he still follow you to your aerobics class? All the time, he's a member now. You might think about giving it up for a while. - It creates... - Creates what? An awkward situation. You know. The clothes. You don't get it, lady! The problem here is Richard Farley not me! - Check it out. - Isn't he cute. Oh, my the smile. Look at that. I don't know. He's adorable. He's new to me. Sure, okay. - All right. - Bye. Here we go. Alright, Laura, give it up. Give it up talk we want details. What? - Come on he's adorable. - Who is he? - What's the deal? - Okay, okay. His name is Sam Waters and he's in systems with Fairchild. And did he ask you out? Oh, maybe. Come on we want the details. What's the story? Well, I don't really know too much about him. But he grew up on a ranch in Montana and he's into rodeo. Well, he can come and play in my corral anytime he wants. Excuse me, I'll be right back. Excuse me, I can't take you anywhere. I spent the whole day at Project Concern, and I have no intention of ever going back there again. You and Penny and Chris you have no idea of who you're messing with here. Go get the manager now! I want you to get out of my way. You think I'm a joke, don't you? No, Rich, I don't you're a joke. Don't you understand why do you wanna find out how far I will go? Is it because you wanna be right and win? Is that you wanna tell everybody that you won? No, it's not about winning. I just wanna be left alone. I just don't think that you should tell anybody about our little talk here, alright? They might get the wrong impression, and then they would do something stupid and then I could do something stupid. And the whole thing could spiral beyond hope of recovery. Get out of here! This could escalate, Laura. I might scare us both with what I'm capable of doing. I'm not sure you fully comprehend the seriousness of this matter. I don't think it's right for you or anyone else to control my private relationships. Do you understand that sexual harassment is against the law? You could be fired. I worked here for over nine years. If I lost my job, I'd have nothing to live for. That's my point. We want you to stay. I have guns. I'd kill myself. I wouldn't be the only one. Others would go. Rich, are you saying if you were fired, you would kill me? Yes. Not just you I'd take others as well. Excuse me. Laura. Richard Farley has been terminated by the company effective today. When did all this happen? Late last night. Laura, do you have a place to go for the weekend? What do you mean? Why don't you go a way for a couple of days? You can leave right now, and why don't you charge the rest of the afternoon to the company. Let me have a diet Cola. Hey, Farley. What you doing playing hooky? Nope. I just got fired. So did Mike here. Well, sit down. Join the club. I'll tell you something that company is going to hell. I put in six years, busted my hump for that company. Doesn't make any difference. They got no loyalty. I was there nine years, and how did they thank me? Terminated, no notice, no appeal. Just like that I'm gone. What's it gonna take to wake them up? Somebody should do something. Make them pay attention. Yep, somebody ought to teach them a lesson. Hell, they're not gonna listen. We're last year's model. What do they care. Larry, you work upfront. Those Mardex doors are they bulletproof glass? No, they're not. What about the doors between the offices are they solid or hallow? Well, they're hallow, why? Rich, what are you talking about? I'll see you guys later. Wait, what are you gonna do? I mean, now that you're free and everything? I don't know. I'll think of something. Hey, Laura. Laura, I'm a free man now. KEI can't tell me what to do anymore, so what do you say we start fresh? I'll tell you what I got some errands to run now, but I'll be back and take you to lunch, okay? Richard Farley is no longer an employee of the company. What about the company getting a restraining order? A restraining order is something you should feel free to pursue on your own. But the company's not going to pay for it. We are no longer involved. But he was fired for sexual harassment. No, he wasn't. He was let because the quality of his work fell off. We thought it would be better that way. Better? Better for whom? You may already have won a million dollars. I don't think so. Ooh, two free toppings on a pizza I'll keep that. Free carpet cleaning coupons. And a letter from you know who. Dear Laura, thank you for getting me fired. It's probably the best thing that ever happened to me. The neutral references from KEI helped me land a job as a software engineer with Prototrends in Cupertino. Complete with stock options and full benefits. I put you down as the beneficiary of my life insurance policy. I'm also taking classes at San Jose State. Got a 92 on my first calc test. Now it's onto linear combinations, augmented matrices and other pleasures of linear algebra. I moved out of Nancy's house to my own place two months ago. The rent is only $450 a month, but I do all the repairs. I'm fixing up a guest room. You're welcome to stay anytime you like. Do you know what really worries me about loving you? I keep wondering would I lose interest if you weren't so difficult? Thing about going to a lawyer for a restraining order is it could get expensive. I wouldn't mind if I was sure it would do some good. But even if he violates the restraining order, all they're gonna do is slap him on the wrist. Yeah, just enough to provoke him. How do you live with this, Laura? Well, at least it's let up. I mean, he's pretty much left me alone lately. I still... Thank you. It's alright, Sam. Believe me, I've learned to live with this. Laura, listen to me. You have got to take this more seriously. Now it goes in just like that. Now you try it. Like that? That's it you got it. Now remember you shoot him. You wanna empty the gun, all nine shots. I couldn't. Yes, you could. There's not a court in the world that would convict you if you shot him on your own property. I don't like this. I can't even believe we're talking about it. All right. Let's just leave this here, and if it really bothers you, I promise I'll come pick it up. Okay? Come on. All right. Thanks, Sam, goodnight. Be careful. I'm just a phone call away if you need me. Alright, thanks. Oh, did I wake you up. I'm really sorry. I just wanted to be sure that you got this note in the morning. How did you get in here? There you go with that attitude. This could be so easy, Laura. If you would just make up your mind to go home dinner with me occasionally, then I wouldn't have to go sneaking into your garage to leave notes on your car. It's really not that hard. This isn't gonna end, is it? That's the point I'm trying to make. The next move is up to you, Laura. As soon as KEI cashes out my retirement fund, I'm gonna buy investment property, and I was hoping that you would go partners with me. It's all there in the letter. I'm gonna let you get back to bed now. Oh, could you send me the new softball schedule? Thanks. Thanks. Alright, take care. - You got it. - Good to see you. Well? Oh, um. I like it. I think, that you're ready for pattern matching and a test run. Chris, don't do this to me. What did they say? Nothing really we discussed corporate planning, and they approved your promotion. Senior project analyst. There's only one hitch, Laura. Your level five security clearances haven't come through. Now you know that you need the clearance tickets to get the promotion, right? They're only gonna wait for so long, Laura. I worked hard for this, Chris. I know. Listen, I think it's because Farley's still following you and screwing things up. Why don't you walk to a lawyer, Laura. Get the restraining order. Richard Farley? Are you the guy from digital? I'm glad to see you. No, I have a legal document for you. This is a temporary restraining order. Laura wouldn't do that to me. She can, and she did, pal. Court date is set for Thursday morning. Wear something conservative judges like that. It's not the judge I'm worried about. Laura, I've seen it happen time and again with guys like Farley. You won't hear from him again after Thursday. Right. I'll be there. Yeah, thanks. Court date's this week to make the restraining order permanent. Good. You did the right thing Laura. You didn't have any choice. Ooh, hurry sign this. Here they come. Anniversary? Yeah, they'll be married a year on Sunday. We're having a cake later. - Hi. - Hi, Wayne. What's going on? Uh, nothing. Nothing. Man, I bet this baby's great off the road. You know, I really like it, Rich. I just can't afford it. Man, one of these days. I'm talking about right now. I just don't have that kind of money. Look, Gary, two years ago I paid 18 for it, and I'm gonna let you have it for 4500. It's worth twice that much. I know that, but something came up, and I need the money. Are you sure about this? Yeah, the only condition is it's got be cash. Sure. Hi, velocity that's what you're buying with this baby. She's the best there is, hands down. - Smooth action? - Oh, you bet. And it doesn't have much of a recoil. That's important for rapid firing. It is the most expensive one we have. There are others that are quite good. You get what you pay for. - I'll take it. - Great. Anything else? We're having a store wide clearance sale. Prices you can't beat. Yes, as a matter of fact there is. Which one of these ammo vests down here holds the most? The one on the right there. It's got the most pockets. Alright, I'll take it. Anything else? Yeah, let me have two of these double-aught buck shells. Two boxes. No, two cases. That's over 2,000 rounds. Like you said you can't beat these prices. I got one over here. I think, you'll like it. I think, this one would be perfect for you. You'll cruise down to Los Angeles in style. Queen sized bed, kitchen, color TV. What I like is it's got a lot of room. How many people you say you wanted it for? It'd just be for me and my wife Laura. She'll be impressed with this. I'm going on a cookie run. Can you get you anything? No, thank you. Hi, dad. Hey, this is a nice surprise. I was thinking about you. Too bad mom is out. How's everything going, Sweetheart? It's all right. I'm finally going to court tomorrow. Listen are you okay with this? I could still fly out there, you know. No, no, it'll be all right. I just wish I could have this over and done with. Tell mom I'm sorry I missed her. I will. Listen you take care of yourself. I love you dad. I love you too. Hi, Larry. You can't be serious. Hey, Larry. Cowboys and Indians. Somebody call security. A shooter in the south lobby. Get someone down here quick. Call the cops. Get down to the south lobby. Get me some security down here. Get some guns or something. Call the cops this guys got a gun. Hurry now. Oh, Ron. No. No! Was that a back fire? That's it, come on go! Oh, god. Oh, no, please don't! Please no! Rich. - Help me. - Don't go that way. Come on. I need both entrances to the parking lot sealed off. Move quickly away from the windows. Keep moving. Take cover behind your cars. We have shots fired. Take cover. Do we know who the shooter is yet? No, Captain. We don't know if we're dealing with a lone gunman or a bunch of terrorists. SWAT team's on the way. What's he doing? Do not enter the building. I repeat do not enter the building. Get him back. Stop that man! Here, come on. Shh, shh. No. No, god. Please don't let me die in here. Please. Oh, god. - Captain Olson? - Yes. - Tom Bannister. - Banister. Our command post is on the second floor here. Our shooter is on the second floor there. Captain. We have a positive ID on the subject. Richard Farley. Evidently this might be about a female employee. Laura Black who works in the building. And she is? As far as we know, still in there. He's on the second floor somewhere between here and there? - Yeah. - Uh-huh. How many employees are still in the building? It's still a guess, but we think the number is somewhere between 30 and 50. Captain. Lieutenant Grijalva hostage negotiator. They have an area set up for you right on the other side of that glass wall, okay? Where are you, Laura? Oh, no. Glenda. No. Here's our boy. I've also got his military history. Let's make sure every man on the SWAT team has one of these. 11 years in the Navy, honorable discharge, top security clearance, no criminal record or history of any mental illness. Until today. He make any demands? They don't know. Captain, we got him on the phone. I just wanna make sure I'm talking to the right person. Yeah, I'm the guy who's shooting people. As a hostage negotiator, my goal is to help get you out of a difficult situation safely. I'm not ready to come out. I wanna gloat for a while. And you can tell them all this is about Laura Black. About what? Tell her lawyer, and her buddy Chris, they gave her bad advice. Are there a lot of people hurt up there, Rich? I'm gonna tell you something right now. I don't wanna see any cops sneaking up on me. I've got an arsenal up here. What sort of weapons do you have? That's all. I'm not saying anymore now. You're a hunter, aren't you, Rich? That's why you know so much about guns, huh? I'd rather kill people than animals. It's not sporting to kill animals. Laura. Oh, my god. Who's doing this? Farley. We've gotta get out of here. Look. Well, we have to do something. We gotta stop this bleeding. Take this. Wait a minute. Please, please, please just take them. - It's okay. - Let me get this around. You take this. Oh, darling. Sorry. No, come on I got to do this. If we assault the building simultaneously with SWAT teams here, here, and here, we can take him. Look, there's still a lot of people inside. Some are wounded and need medical attention. I know. But the price of storming that building I can't live with that at least not right now. What if we get Farley in front of a window? Then you have a green light. Take him out. Are we sure these are all the office phone numbers on the second floor? I'll double check. We're set up to have all outgoing calls come to us. Hello. Yeah, is this Rich? We heard a gunshot in there is everything okay? Who are you trying to kid? You're just trying to lock in my position, so you can blow me away. Sorry, sir, he wasn't on the line long enough. Hey, we can put that cabinet in front of the door. No, we stay right here and be quiet. No, no, no. No, I can't. I can't just stay here and wait for him to get me. No, Laura, you can't go out there. Shh, Laura, no. I will not die in here. - No. - No. Security. I need you to stay off this line. - Call back at... - What? I said get off the line. I have been shot I will not get off the line. Forgive me I'm sorry. Who are you? Laura Black. Laura, where were you shot? In the shoulder I've lost a lot of blood. Laura, what is your exact location? I'm in the second floor in a reception area. I need someone to get me out of here. Hang on, Laura. We're gonna try and get you out of there. When? When, I can't. I'm having a really hard time breathing. I think, my lungs is punctured. I think it's punctured, I can't. You gotta get me out of here. Laura, just keep talking to us. I'll try. I'm gonna die. It's really. Laura? Laura, talk to me. Hello? Laura? Get the person who saw him drive this motor home into the lot. Captain? This is Olson go ahead. Shagan, I'm in the motor home. He's carrying fuses and wire. He may have explosives in there. Yeah. It's Laura Black. - Thank god - I passed out. Look I don't know how much longer I can hang on. Someone's got to come and get me out of here. Laura, listen. There's no way to send someone in right now. You're gonna have to sit tight for a while. Laura? Laura? I'm only gonna say this once. I can see the SWAT team from the window moving up on the Bancroft Boulevard side. I want them stopped, or I'm just gonna start blowing things up around here. Do you understand what I'm saying? Now just take it easy. Look, I know I'm gonna die here. But I'm gonna decide when. Lieutenant Bannister, have your people pullback - from the Bancroft side. - Right, sir. Tell me something, Rich. In addition to all the guns, do you have explosives in there too? You're damn right I do. I came to teach these people a lesson. It's Laura's fault that things got to this point. I warned her something like this would happen. I told her I couldn't let her get away with it, and I'm warning you. We'll have a lot more bodies if I see anymore police near the building. Basically none of this would've happened if she'd gone out with me just one time. I don't think that was too much to ask. Do you? Why does she have to be so stubborn? I didn't even decide to hurt her until I got that court order. They were warned I couldn't let that happen. That's why we've got bodies all over the place. I had to show them. Let them know I'm not a wimp. Look I'm gonna check on that SWAT team, and if I see them, you've got a big problem. Look we'd like to resolve things, so that nobody gets hurt. Come on pullback. Tell them let's move it back. Pull it back. Alright, stay back come on everybody. Someone's coming out. Get down! Get down! - Watch your fire. - Hold your fire. This is all because of me. What did I do? Just tell me what I did? We're gonna get you to the hospital now. Just relax everything's gonna be fine. What's your name? Laura Black. Well, tell me, Rich, how do you think we can resolve this? I don't think we can. I kind of made up my mind I'm gonna die here. It's just a question of when and who I take with me. Get me a diet Cola and I'll think about it. I need a diet Cola and a sandwich. My boss might go for that. But he's gonna want something in return. I don't want a can of diet Cola. I want a cup, one of those large quart sized cups with a lot of ice in it. I chew up ice, so I need a lot of ice in it. We gotta get moving here. I don't like her blood pressure. I need a chest tube stat. She's got an entrance one on her shoulder. Shattered up her humerus. Looks like a shotgun. Figure it got to her lung. I need a trauma room and a vascular surgeon stat. We'll start transfusion right now. Make sure there's blood in the trauma room. Where's the chest tube? I need the chest tube. One, two, three. Does anybody know her name? Laura Black they said it on the news. Don't check out on me, Laura, you hear? We're certain he's in this area of the second floor. We're gonna try to evacuate the first floor. We need you to keep him occupied. I can use the fact he wants us to get him a drink and a sandwich. I was hoping he might exchange the food for some of his guns. He could be getting tired. Well, if you can get him to get rid of the guns by throwing them out of any of these windows, I can have one of my sharpshooters take him out. Think you can do that? Well, I'd like to try and get him to give up first. No problem. But if he's not willing, you get him in front of a window. Yes, sir. Yeah. He's got him on the line. How you doing in there? - Come on go. - Come on, go. On the double let's go guys. First floor lobby. Well, I'm thinking about giving up if that's what you mean? Hold on a minute. Oh, it's Nancy. Come out of there, Nancy. You better get out of here. Let me do something for you, Rich. It's too late for that. Just go, Nancy. What about my food? Come on let's go bring her through. This way, this way. Well, like I said, Rich. My boss is gonna want something in return. Would you be willing to give up some of your weapons for some food? How would I get them to you? I was thinking if you broke one of the windows facing Bancroft you can throw them out. Of course, we'd want you to unload them first. No way, I'm giving you all my guns. Well, how about just some of them. It would be a sign, something I could take back to my boss, Rich, you understand? Okay. Okay, I'll get rid of one of the shotguns and a 22-Magnum pistol. Now here's what I would like to eat besides the quart sized diet Cola a number 26 sandwich for Togo's. Togo's? It's just up to the street on Hollywood. Okay. I'd like a number 26, no tomatoes with Swiss cheese. - Okay, a number 26. - It's their best. No tomatoes. Make it large. I may have to eat twice. I may be here a while. Hang on, Rich, don't hang up now. Give me a minute. Let me pass this information to my boss, okay? I can't find Laura here. I think she got out. I'd like to know if she's doing okay. I don't know that I'll have to check and get back to you. Yeah, check it. I think she got out. I hope she's doing good 'cause I want her to live. She can't regret it if she doesn't live. I want Laura to know I was serious. I had to get back at her. I'd go to her games, and she would sit two feet from me. Then she'd point and laugh at me and talk behind my back. She can't play with people's lives. - Locked here. - Ready. Looks like him. We're set here, Captain. Copy that. Ready on two. If you can get him into position, we're set. All right. Here we go. Recording. How long does it take to get a sandwich and a diet Cola? I have them right here in front of me, Rich. I have a number 26 and a quart-sized diet Cola. All you gotta do is throw the guns out the window. Okay, I'm gonna break out one of the windows on the Bancroft side, and then I'm gonna throw out the weapons. Right, but make sure they're all unloaded. Okay, I'm gonna try to break out one of the windows with a chair. Rich? Yeah. One thing once you throw the weapons out, we still have the problem of getting the sandwich and the diet Cola back up to you. Yeah, we do. Why don't you come down and have them here? Basically, give myself up is what you're saying. That's what I'd like you to do, yes. First I'd have to ask myself do I really wanna live in jail? Of course, you do. You could teach computers there. Yeah, I could teach there. I have to think about it. Rich, I have your diet Cola sitting right here in front of me, and the ice is melting. The ice is melting, huh? Okay. Let me know when you're ready. Hey, he's got him talked down. Doctor, can you tell me anything about Laura Black? Are you a relative? I'm her roommate. Your roommate is a fighter. She's going to make it. Oh, god. Can I see her? They'll be taking her down to recovery in a few minutes. Okay. When you come down the stairs, there'll be an officer there to give you directions. Do exactly what he tells you to do. I try not to get down on my knees. They're bad and it hurts me. So if he wants me to get down on my knees, he's gonna have to let me go real slow. That's all right you can talk to him. Just tell him you're gonna be moving real slow. I'm gonna come down there to meet you. Now remember move very, very slowly. You okay? I'm fine. Okay, I'll see you there. He's moving now. He's moving now. All right just take it easy. Turn around hands against the wall let's go. You better check my chest. I saw a movie once where a guy had a Derringer on a chain around his neck. Alright, you're under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law. You have a right to an attorney. If you cannot afford one, one will be provided for you. Do you understand these rights? Where's my sandwich. Hi, Rich. I brought you your food. - Let's go. - Do you think Laura will remember all of this? Webrip
