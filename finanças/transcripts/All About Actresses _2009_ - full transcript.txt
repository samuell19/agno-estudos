"REAL! The Documentary Passion" Alright? Not too rushed? Romeo, hurry up! Which one? I dunno. Superman? Spiderman? Batman? Batman, Spiderman and Flash Gordon? So, which one? I dunno. Those are for babies. Would I dress you like a baby? Why can't I wear an NTM t-shirt? I told you, not for school. - But my friends do. - They do what they want. Why do you wear one? Why not an NTM t-shirt? - School's not a fashion show. - It's so cute. Promoting dad's work... Want a t-shirt from my movie? Nobody's even seen your movie. Have a nice day. Choose anyone you please And come join the dance Don't miss your chance As scene fades into scene Look into these vast bowers And pick some enticing flowers They're the kind that exhale A heady kind of scent That let you experiment With an intoxicating tale It's the actresses' ball Behind the scenes and all Narcissistic, tragico-romantic It's the actresses' ball Behind the scenes and all Comic, explosive, mystic, erotic ALL ABOUT ACTRESSES It's not just on movie screens That they play their biggest scenes In the panorama Life sends you reeling From behind my camera They call all the shots The focus is on their secrets As long as the light Softens their plight Until a new scandal breaks And the damage takes its toll The actresses' ball So what's it called? I want to call it The Actresses' Ball. Why a ball? I'll have scenes where they talk about their dreams, but as they sing and dance. A little like in a musical comedy. You doing a documentary or a musical? A documentary! - A musical documentary? - Right. Remake your first film as a musical. - Get Cecile de France... - Excuse me? So you're not interested? All you care about is money. Money! Money! You wanna produce a romantic comedy, right? A Gallic "Bridget Jones" with Jean Dujardin and Audrey Tautou? I'd love to. - How original can you get! - That's movies. - You're sweet. - You haven't got any balls. Next time you go shopping, buy yourself a pair of balls. So it's just you alone or with a crew? - This is my crew. - And no lights. No. Fly on the wall. Sure, you really have to agree to being filmed without makeup, right out of bed in not very flattering situations. I'm looking for authenticity... Yeah, I get it. No glamor or anything. I have such a fixed image, a little like an icon. I want to communicate who I am, I mean, someone simpler, who actually leads a pretty humdrum life but... Because I often suffer from being... always a bit superior. Actually I'm very simple. You're an actress, aren't you? I was. I mean, I am, a little. Yes, I'm an actress. I don't want to talk about myself. As much as we try not to talk of ourselves, we always do when we're in a movie. We direct it, we imagine it, we write it, we work on it. We always talk about ourselves, no matter what. This time, I don't want to talk about me and my neuroses. It's the actresses I'm filming that I'm interested in. I really want to film their mystery, film their self-doubts, film... the thirst for love actresses have that is... so amazing... You think they need more love than other women - who aren't actresses? - Oh, yes. Then it's neurotic. We don't become actresses if we're not neurotic. I completely agree with you. Anyway, I'll try to film the charm an actress has. That charm appears when a woman needs to beloved. I think the charm comes through... in a need for attention, a need for love. Did he eat well? Sure, he's asleep, even. - Sorry. - See the time? I spent the whole day with actresses. - Okay. - Hold on! I start shooting soon. I'll be filming actresses all over. It might happen again. So if you can tell Joey... It's not my job to talk to Joey. That's your business. I'm just here until 8 p.m. I look after Romeo and that's all. - And how do we manage Romeo? - You manage. My gig tomorrow also important. She sells millions of albums. We can't miss out on this. But Karin Viard sells millions of tickets. Cut it out! Who's Karin Viard? And who's Diam's? - Someone who sells records. - Well, she sells movie tickets! - So what? - Okay. - In your world. - So music beats movies? The day you bring home more dough, then maybe I'll become an actor. Do your duo with Diam's for now. - You're a pain! - So are you. Why always my compromises? Get off my back! - You know about actresses? - Here we go! Let's hear it. - You know them up close. - Please, don't. And anyway... You'll bust your balls with actresses who'll just get on your nerves. - We shooting for real now? - Yes. Hi! - My darling. - How are you, Bertrand? This is Maiwenn. She's doing a documentary. She'll follow us today. If it bothers you, tell her to stop. Can we do this later? - She can't hurt me? - Nothing. No horns? She's heavier than you but harmless. Okay, we're pals. Help! I'll let her go. This might be trickier than we thought. You have to take... Help! I'm not doing this. You're the actress. Don't worry. I'm scared, too. Oh, shit! Bertrand, whenever you want. - Everyone ready? - Ready, Bertrand. Speed! No speed. - What is it, sound man? - Just a sec. A slight problem. Take your time, fella. 80 people are waiting. No sweat. The five nominations for Best Sound are... Ready, everyone. - Scene 70A, take 2. - Tracking! Will you get off my back? Can't you see I'm walking out on you? I'm tired of your shitty life, your milk-stinking cows, and your common sense love. I wasn't cut out to work. I was made to have a guy with lots of cash supporting me year-round, and not make me get up every morning for this crappy work, with my hands in manure. I want an easy life, understand? I want money. I'm tired of dressing like a frump, like your mother. Cut! - Did you like that, Bertrand? - It was good. - We'll improve on it. - Let's do it. - How many takes do you usually do? - Very few. You might adopt the expression of an unhappy woman. Let's see what happens if you keep it a little more bottled up. This is a girl who wants to rebel but doesn't really have the nerve. It's almost a dream: "If I had more nerve, I'd tell you this..." I'm sick of your shitty life, your stinking cows, your love full of commiseration. I'm not cut out to work. I can't take it anymore. Cut. Nice start. That was fine. Isabelle Huppert once said, "A good director "is a director who's in love with his actress "but won't act on it." It's something all directors and actresses know. You have to be a little bit in love with your actress. At least during work hours. Even more if possible. It's better. You stick your finger in so it doesn't spill? You stick it up your ass. To us! Does everyone on a film really sleep around? I never slept with Bertrand Blier, but I sure would have liked to. - Bouncy-bouncy in your room. - Ever cheat on your husband? Never! Never in my life. This isn't good for my skin. I'll need a day of detox tomorrow. It's 6 a.m. I'm going to wake up Karin Viard in the next room. What? Who is it? - Up. You have a train to catch. - Being filmed like this! It's not very pleasant. See, I'm not stopping you from filming. The bathroom's on the other side. I'll guide you. I'm still drunk. Damn! Let me see you just a little as you wake up. No way. Get out of here! I really want to make movies in the United States... It may sound trite, but I think there are real openings for me there. I'm not being pretentious or arrogant, but France is a bit too small for me now. Been there, done that. I have a coach teaching me accents, English, American, Irish. I'm also working on a Cockney accent. You know, Cockney. - Something like that. - Really? Sure. I want to sell abroad. I want power. It's a good springboard to the mega-budget movies and blockbusters. - That's my aim, I admit. - Really? Sure. I want to shoot in the U.S. I want to have power there. I think it's possible. You'd move there with husband and children? Sure. I mean, we'd have to see. My career is my passion. It's what matters most in my life. But after your children? After my children. But I won't sacrifice my career in any way. - There's a huge line! - It's nothing. Why didn't we reserve a taxi? It's raining, too! What a drag! I don't these situations, Maiwenn... You should have called a taxi. I'm so sorry. Isn't there a priority line for the disabled or pregnant women? - You're not disabled or pregnant. - But I'm famous. Excuse me, mister. Would you mind if I go ahead of you? I have an important appointment. Sure, so do I. He didn't recognize me. Excuse me. An intern just called. Someone was to pick you up, but forgot. Someone was supposed to pick me up. It's all right. I ended up taking a bus. I loved it. We should discuss it. You could map out little bus routes for me. I just loved taking the bus. I adored it. Check out little bus rides I can take. - Think I'm a good actress? - Oh, you're hot. I asked you a question. Am I a better director than actress? There's stuff I wish you did better. Like what? Like being present. There's a little boy here who would also enjoy that. How's that for a role? NATIONAL DRAMA CONSERVATORY What mattered was passing the entrance competition, not the conservatory. What mattered was passing the test, like when I was a kid. I called my parents from the post office next door. And I said, "I made the Conservatory." I think that's how I said it. It didn't mean much for them. The Conservatory, for provincial shoe store owners, didn't really register. Is this your first classic play? That's unusual. A change from stand-up comedy. It may seem unusual to you, but I am an actress. At Conservatory, playing Molière isn't unusual. What's unusual is not having done it. That's unusual. That wasn't planned. I wanted to be Annie Girardot, I missed that boat. I don't know who I am. Fernand Raynaud? That's not it. That's how the story goes. Until now. But the story can change. It can and will change, because I want it to. Hold on. I'm out of focus. "'Twould be a sin to let you make this match." "Be still, you viper!" Sorry, let me stop you. Sometimes, I hear too much... I'd almost say, "Muriel Robin." I need you to call me on that. And at the same time, you shouldn't... How can I put it... Some actors do theater when they should stay in TV, and they tell you: "I'm doing this play so people know who I really am." It drives me up the wall. You are what I see of you. What you give me. "I speak for your own good." "Pray you, hold your tongue." - "'Tis love of you." - "Spare me your affection." "I'll love you despite your objection." "Stop interrupting!" Louis de Funès-style... "Be still!". Don't tell me you want a laugh every line? Don't be afraid of what you can be. Don't think: "Since I'm a comic, I shouldn't be funny." - We'll see how we can... - The nature of the text. Nature, if left alone, climbs out of the chaos it fell into. - "'Tis love of you." - "Spare me your affection." "I'll love you despite your objection." So, Jacques? They're steps. It doesn't matter. For chrissakes, when you're in front of 5,000 people, you go for it! Enough talk. We'll do the scene first and talk later. "You talk and talk, I'm maddened by it. "Once and for all, I tell you, be quiet." "Very well. But I'll be thinking hard." "Think all you please..." Think of our situation. I'm getting on your nerves. So go for it! Shall we break here? I like the tension here. Let's talk things out. - That's theater. - I know what theater is. Yes and no. I get the feeling you haven't rehearsed in ages. This is your clique, not mine. That's all. I'm not in any clique since I invited you to come do the play! Anyway, enough is enough. You come with your gimmicks and tics. I don't understand you. We're on different planets. Mine's called Life, and it's a lot more interesting than all your talk. I never read much. I don't have your culture. You can't say "I have no culture. I'm ignorant and accept it, dammit!" Cut the crap! That's not the problem. I never said anything about culture! Otherwise, I would have picked someone who's... Muriel Robin isn't culture! Now I understand why people hate theater. Then so long! See you around! I'll calm down. I'm calm! And Maiwenn there with her so-called documentary on actresses! A documentary on actresses isn't theater! - Interesting things were said here. - So long! It's like a TV talk show. Just fucking navel-gazing. She's being stupid. That dumb bitch could be great, without her "Me! Me!" routine! I often have this dream, A spectator stops the scene. She climbs up on the stage I'm no longer the rage. I was lovely, brilliant, droll, For me all hearts were astir, She robbed me of my role, The bouquets are for her. When night turns to day, This dream just fades away. I often have this dream. Before thousands in the dark, An actress comes on stage. I'm no longer the rage. Where are you kids? Happy birthday! Speech! Speech! Where's Mommy? I don't know. But keep going. She's on her way. Cut the cake. Where's Mommy? She's coming. She's on her way. She's coming. Okay? Let's hear it for Romeo... Hip! Hip! Hurray! Happy birthday, honey. I forgot. - You okay? - You might have told me. That it's your son's birthday? You have to be reminded? That's a good one. We can call later. One more try. These things are horrible, you'll see. As soon as you lose a few ounces, the lines deepen. It's horrible. They're a bitch to light. Guys will tell you that. So you fill them in, here. I haven't had it done yet. Here I've had done a lot. Usually stars do it, but guys do it, too. Give me some names? No, I can't. Benoit Magimel's not coming? Just kidding. Just kidding. It's okay. It's okay. That isn't Botox? This is hyaluronic acid. It fills in the furrows. The furrows. It works nicely on you. It works really well. That's all, Marina. What are these marks? You're a bit stressed out. So the skin reacts. It's normal. I have things to do later. It's awful. I look like... They'll clear up in two hours. It leaves holes! Not at all. Well, yes. This bums me out. I thought I was above it all, that I took it with humor, with irony. "To hell with my looks!" Here I am spending a fortune on Botox! And getting filmed doing it! - Don't worry, Marina! - It gets to me! I can't stand my own contradictions! What do I owe you? Maybe we should work on your breasts instead of your face. We should think about your breasts. Oh, shit! - Can you pause it? - Off to a bad start. Are my breasts sagging? A little. Not much. It's the light. And you never told me? She better stay off my case! That's an awful thing to say. My breasts don't sag. Liar! When I straighten up, they don't. Then everything's fine. You don't give a shit. Yeah, but I love you anyway. Get undressed. Okay. Oops! My fly... There's work to do here. My producers don't think you're right for the role. So they've contacted a couple of other actresses who are better known, more popular than you. They're reading the script now. Who are the other two? What difference does it make who the actresses are? It doesn't. But who? There's Cecile de France. - Marion Cotillard. - I know her. And there's you. - But I'd like you to audition. - Meaning? You do auditions with everybody? Not with those actresses. Alright... What for? I only know you from your TV comedy skit show. I want to see you in something else. We'll do an audition. That stuff with the TV comedy skit show is verging on insulting. Like questioning if Poolevoorde can do serious drama. We're off to a bad start. It's not a bad start, it just has nothing to do with my experience. I find that... I'm not interested in hearing this kind of argument. Oh, no? It's all so trite. How about you, what have you done? - I made a short film. - A short... But I really love actors. Who does she think she is? When I see stuff like this, honestly... When can I see you again? I'll call you. I'll call you. Bye. If she bothered to check, TV skits aren't all I've done. She didn't do her research. It's her problem if she pigeonholes people. It's humiliating. She set up a meeting just to say I'm no actress? Does she think she's Pialat? Just because he was a bully, you have to bully people now? What is this? She shouldn't talk to me like that. If I'm no actress, why meet me? Then I end up having to justify myself. "Well, I've done classical drama and all." Fuck that! On top of that... I like... I have an appointment for an audition. Audition? Oh, yes... I'm a bit embarrassed, Marina. I left a message this morning. I'm a bit surprised to see you. The message said not to come. After speaking to Catherine, she decided not to do the audition. I'm really sorry. The last time she met with you, you weren't in great shape, she said. She found you a bit pale. She mentioned blotches on your skin. And especially, she said you were touchy. - That's it. - Look, Marina... Look, see you around, or whatever. Don't get worked up, please. Don't get upset. You really have to keep your ego out of this. you see how we're treated? Luckily I have some ego left to keep me going. An ego helps to keep self-respect. Don't even start with "actress egos"! What a cliché! Don't you have an ego? What an idiot! Shit! Why do I let them talk to me like that? Makes no sense! I deserve better, I'm sorry! What a bitch! Did she even ask if I liked her lousy short? She's financed by ARTE and dreams of TF1! She wants it all. She wants to make blockbusters that are art house, too. She wants laughs, but... She doesn't know what she wants! She'll never make it. The casting director was right. Keep your ego out of it. Whose side are you on? Who are you filming? Me or not? Put yourself in my shoes. You an actress or not? Go do a documentary on directors and their casting woes. What a mess! That business in the 2nd district... It's the same in our neighborhood. What? These are people who are French... Frankly, I think the current government is making a total mess of things! I agree with you, ma'am. - My parents were Polish. - And me... They came to France in '49. No, my father arrived in '21. He got citizenship in '49. I'll tell you, right now, Sarko... is a real scumbag! That's the word. Goodbye. That sure puts things in perspective. So much for your problems. It's just a casting incident. That's true. And she's right. You should interview him about actresses. He knows everything. He styles all the famous actresses? What do you want to know? Any Hollywood actresses come here? Sure. And I go there sometimes. - To Hollywood? For a style? - For a color job. A round trip for a style and a color job? For instance, I go for Kristin Scott Thomas. I mean, the real Hollywood. Isn't Scott Thomas medium-Hollywood? That's mean. You're being catty. - Like Julia Roberts, for instance. - No, not Roberts. Not Sharon Stone either. Does Sharon Stone make movies? Does she even have hair? She has no hair. Sharon Stone doesn't exist. She's a hologram. - A virtual actress. - You bet. But I've been to L.A. for Penelope Cruz. You color her hair? Who has the biggest bush... of hair in French movies? Catherine Deneuve. Really? - I'm glad to hear that. - Why glad? Because I have a big bush of hair. It makes me feel less alone. A lot of hair. Catherine and me, sisters! I hope... I hope it goes well. Leaving without paying? Leaving without paying? She doesn't understand the star system. Be right there. I thought it'd be fun, but it's not. Why not? You're a budding actress like me, and you end up waiting on directors you idolize or actors you feel like kissing. If I talk to them, it's the sack. The sack? - A waitress just got fired for that. - For what? Giving her résumé to Tarantino. - Poor kid. - She got fired. I worked every bar in town. The Hotel Costes is my last chance. If I get fired I might as well do betting parlors. My name is Karole Rocher. I'm 33. Sensations and emotions. I'm here to learn things about myself. Dig life and accept good vibes. I'm excessive, but I'm working on it... Excuse me again. Sorry... Why is there a camera here? I feel ashamed of my body, because I just had a baby. Sit off to the side. Just don't film her. If you're not filmed, it's okay? Or just from here up. Intense grief. Laughter. Tears. Oh shit. I know it's not easy. Just never quit. Like dancers. Dancers never sit down. Just keep going. You lost your whole family in an earthquake. You laugh and cry the same way. Intense grief. What does that mean? No comments! Don't get mad. We're in class. I can ask questions and talk. - No comments, thank you. - We're not children. Don't worry about being ridiculous. Go all the way. What's the point? It reinforces and deepens an actor's receptiveness. - Meaning? - It makes you more flexible. Switch. Switch. Stop. What do you all notice? Sure, it's funny. It's funny when animal urges come out unexpectedly. Sure, it's funny, and you all have to accept it. So what do you notice about what he's doing? You'll say, that's terrific! There's a bitch in you. But that's too easy! Do you feel like a dog now? Karole dear, you're going through a major negativity crisis. It's ridiculous. It's too easy. Screw his animal side. It's ridiculous. I can do a monkey, too. Didn't I do my exercise well? Anyone can do it. My mother acts like a pig. My mother does a pig. Please! Do you know what we sacrifice to be here? You know what it costs us all? You know what hopes we put in it? We'll take back our 1500 euros and monkey around among ourselves. - We'll top each other. - Karole, that's enough! "Yeah, you did a great pig! You stole the show!" Were you proud of her César award? Yes, we were very happy that night. You were dressed like a whore. What did he say? He said I had... a nice dress on. Our family is well assimilated in France. So I see. My daughter went to university. I have a business degree and I worked in marketing. Now you're an actress. You know we don't like that. Why talk like that in front of my friend? I don't like you offending our tradition. Enough with the secrets. We realized we had a lover in common. She's not with him anymore. Neither am I. It creates a bond. Next time, tell me when you invite friends like her. She's not proper. I don't like that at all. Eat. "Lightning avoids meals." - Eat. - I'm alright. Acting in Vietnam is a contemptible profession. So what? I won a César. What more do you want? To hell with the César! We're a Vietnamese family. Maiwenn, please stop filming! When I was a little girl I dreamed of screen celebrity Playing in movies In a non-stop picture show My father and mother Had no faith in me, though But I would tell myself "Gone with the wind I shall be." No, my parents Don't understand No, my parents Don't understand And then I grew up Between color and black & white Cinecitta, Hollywood, Michele Morgan, Neither Father nor Mother Could ever be a fan Of movies by Godard and Kazan What are all these bellies? I'm working on a part where I'm pregnant. How does it look? Could I keep it to practice with? I don't know how to walk with one. Can I keep it? I can? I feel good in it. All right. I'll ask. Because it's rented. Tell them the actress has to practice. All right. When are you free next week? Next week, Monday through Thursday. I'm so happy! Why? Nothing... I don't usually... It makes me... It's like a dream. It will happen. But first you have to dream, don't you? I don't know, Julie. I think so. I think that... it will happen to me. - You should feel the stirrups. - Relax your perineum. Your perineum. Easy... - There it is! - The head's out. Yuck! This is like a Catherine Breillat movie. Take a deep breath. Hold it, push on the stirrups. Push! He's wrapped up in his cord. Now for the head. He has his cord around his neck. It's a boy. Fernand Lamaze was the first... Isn't it beautiful? I've watched it a hundred times and it always moves me. Hold on. Would you show me your apartment? You've seen it. For the documentary. - Act as if we don't know each other. - You think so? - I introduce myself and all that? - Yes. "My name is Julie..." Hello, Maiwenn. My name is Julie. - Not Maiwenn. "My name is Julie." - Okay. Hello, my name is Julie. I'm an actress. Let me show you my home. That's a... Oh, look. That's Cecilia. - Is she a dwarf hen? - You can see she's not a baby. She's fully grown. They don't reproduce. What's with the hens, the garden? They lay an egg a day. That's something. I like productive things, even if I'm not. Talk about how you care for your garden. It takes a lot of fertilizer and anti-slug pellets. - Anti-slug? - Otherwise they devour everything. It's all gone overnight. - Talk about your rabbits. - What? Your rabbits. There you see Ginette and Raymond. They had a little bunny. It's a boy. I checked. The worse I feel, the more I decorate, the more flowers I wear. When I'm really depressed, I'm usually covered in flowers. Now, I'm okay. But you don't decorate with pictures of yourself, or put up movie posters. For instance, you won Césars but we don't see them around. But if you're proud of your work, why not? What's that mean? Proud as what? Proud as a peacock? It's not a feeling I'm interested in. You can be proud of a child, but modest, so you don't show you're proud. Pride is not a feeling I've ever had. For myself... For someone you love... Sometimes you can feel ashamed for someone you love. Are you passionately into it? When you act, does it give you the energy and love you don't get elsewhere? I don't doubt myself when I act. But in real life, all the time. Stop. Close. On your stomachs now. Feel your abdomen breathing. Easy now, don't do it, Julie. Feel the well-being inside. Why embrace hopes And dream futilely Of thousands of breasts Nursing thousands of babies. What is the point of dreaming Of water in the desert, My vocabulary Has no place for motherhood In the movies, I'm so motherly But for me, no happy... Event. Honestly, no shit. I'd rather you didn't... It makes me seem narcissistic. I don't like it. There aren't that many. This one's nice. What are all those bags? Gifts. Are you kidding? Repeat for the camera? These are all gifts name brand houses send me to wear at premieres. I can't wear everything. You didn't even open them! I have to. And write thank-you notes. Sophie does that. I don't have time. How long have you had these scripts? - Two or three weeks. - All these... What's the matter? Some new parmesan diet? Your fridge only has parmesan. Is that not a good diet? I'll show you three colors for the cover and you choose. Okay. Honest, girls, I don't know. I think it must be the red. I spent two hours yesterday. I taped them to my wall. I went out and came back. Your color is red. It's an immediate touch of class. - So red then. - Great. I don't go out. I take it easy. I stay at home with friends. A good book or a good DVD. Not one of my films. - I see that Maiwenn disagrees. - What is it? No, I don't go out. I'm tired of all that stuff. What's going on behind my back? Do you exercise? I do yoga. It's new for me. I really enjoy it. Which shakra did you open? I opened... The first one. I have a hard time with the second. Let me jot that down. I'm lost in the forest of my feelings right now. That's perfect for the role. This girl's in the forest, lost in her feelings. You're a terrific actress... You read that this girl's not well, and immediately you're not well. Yvan, I can't take it any more. I can't. I love to hear that. That's precisely the character's state of mind. She's like this... She's like you. - You're making fun of me. - No I'm not. You say you're not doing well? It's not the same problem. I've been having real doubts about my career lately. What kind of doubts? The desire's gone. I can't walk on a set anymore. That's when you should make a movie! It's the best thing for a role. We're talking about work. In this state, I might go into a depression. Depression is great for the movie! This girl is desperate. We can shoot tomorrow. - No. - Why not? I can't shoulder it right now. I'm fragile. Perfect! You can't protect me the whole time. I'll protect you. I'll bring you salads, zucchini, carrots, asparagus, tuna fish, whatever you want. I no longer have the fire. This is a good thing. - Everything all right? - Fine, thank you. Why not Charlotte? I can work with other actresses. - You work well together. - Sure. Okay, but we have two children. It'd be nice if she stayed home a bit to look after my kids for once. Look, I'll be going. Okay? Thanks for the green beans. You're welcome. Hold on, I'm absolutely serious. She did a number on me. "I'm so tired." She struck a pose. She talks. When I see you I'll imitate her. The parody of a dumb actress and her ego who wants to quit, who wants to act, who doesn't want to act, etc. You bust your balls on a script for an actress and at the last minute she tells you... whatever. "I'm tired... The fire's gone." She tells me stuff... I'm not kidding! A bunch of nonsense: "The forest of my feelings." She gives me poetry. I didn't understand a thing. She left me sitting here. She came, ate two carrots and left. I don't know. I think l have an idea. Finished? - Not the pasta, but I have a question. - Yes? Would you like to make a movie? - That's funny. - What? Is that a come-on? Let me talk. I'm serious. I wrote a script. You're just the part. - You staying for the whole class? - It's almost over. I'll leave soon. Stand where I can't see you. I don't want to make others uncomfortable. I wouldn't say, I wouldn't say It was the blues, but it wouldn't quit I wouldn't say, I wouldn't say, It was like working in a pit, Running every which way I couldn't take it, I wouldn't take it. It was the bottom of the pool I hit I was done, I was through With swapping my jeans for an evening gown What's it to you if I do what I do? Keep your pool at Castes I'd rather watch Lost Or only be a vanishing point. Say bye-bye... Brushes and charcoal Is all I need Take it from me, Take it from me, To be a pin-up beauty ls not my duty. - Melanie... - Yeah, sorry. - Talk to me. - Well, nothing... Just a void. It's this stupid career that... I let it swallow me. It'll pass. Having your period? I wish that was it. Poor sweetie. That's why I need to get away. Holy shit! Nice. He'll hit me the face! I met a really adorable family. They took me into their home. I sleep in the living room. They made space for me. I live with them, eat with them... mostly just rice, but anyway... It's incredible! I feel alive again. No luxuries. It does me good to be with real people. No, really I don't need a thing. Give your violence free rein. Take pleasure in dominating him, bringing him into submission, Having him at your feet, under your heel. Go on, grovel! Ask me forgiveness. Kiss my leg, my shin. Work your way up. Lick my knee. Lick my knee, that's it. - Okay, that's enough. - Quiet, please. What a joke! We'll discuss it after the exercise. There, ask forgiveness. Take pleasure in submission. Excuse me. - Your turn's coming. - I'd like to do it with you. - With me? - I'd like to. You little slut! You cow! You bitch! I'm supposed to submit, is that it? You supposed to be dominating me? Okay. If you're the least bit receptive... Go ahead. That's domination? I'll keep that in mind. Know what they call a failed actress? What? - A has-been. - A Christine, they call her? - And know what they call... - Christine. Know what you are? - They call your kind... - You're twisted! - A never-been! - You're twisted! Know what? You can't dominate anyone, not even yourself! Self-pity apart, I know what it is to be dominated, to be submissive, to a situation or a person. You're nothing. You don't dominate anyone! You break people, you're breaking me! You're turning me off studying! You're turning me off, turning all of us off acting! You just humiliate us! You're getting your rocks off. Because your life is a failure! For me it's six months' wages and all my hope! You're teaching us frustration, bitterness! - It's scandalous! - It's your choice. - I have no choice. - Keep going or quit. I had a choice before I enrolled. Now that I've paid, I have no choice. What does acting mean to you? Give me three words I can use! Three words that don't cost 1500 euros. 1500 for nothing! Here they are: Don't go into acting. You know what? - Don't go into acting. - You succeeded at domination. You did it, you dominate all of us! Let's see. Pathetic! I can't believe she adopted him. The French Angelina Jolie! "I felt like a mother on the spot. It was like a lightning strike. "I hope to give him all the love he needs." There's two potatoes in the microwave feed them that with grated cheese. Can you pick up two veal cutlets at the butcher's? You have money left from last week? Okay, lots of love. You take magnesium? You wicked girl! Don't empty my freezer. I'm just looking. You're a Leader Price fan. I don't shoot with Spielberg. I'm not a James Bond girl either. What are you taking? Magnesium. Why? You depressed? Five roles, two miscarriages, an abortion, a breakup, a new romance, two children to raise... lt's all a bit much. That's life. I should hide the hard stuff. Hang on. What if he comes back? Just wait and watch. PENCIL DICK What do you mean, tagged? Tagged with black spray paint on the hood. - On your red Porsche? - Yes, my red Porsche. - What did they write? - "Dickhead." This means a whole new paint job. Okay, quiet on the set. Places, everyone. Camera ready. One last linking shot. The other day I said you'd make a great weather girl. It wasn't meant as an insult. Here's what we'll do: I'd like a card. "Do you still love me?" "Do you still love me?" Cut! Cut! It was lifeless, like a dead fish. Let's go. "Do you still love me?" "I'm not an easy man." "That's true." Good. Cut! Thank you. Let's do the next shot. No, one more take. But if you got it. I don't understand. Film is expensive. Why bother with another take? You've got it all: the lovesick look, Schubert... We're at what take: 22, 23? 23... I mean... You see the...shut up! Let me talk for a change, okay! You know, there's a point we get sick of your stupid artsy-fartsy directing. Three weeks of this now... I'm talking here! To a pop tune, I say stop I'd rather be called a slut Than make myself sick In your fucking pic Sweep it away Give me some air With Francis Veber Be a box office blitz With Kassovitz Sweep it away, give me air Shift into action In a movie by Luc Besson I won't start being a better actress than I've been Someone I am not, Just so you can preen You highbrow phonies Drive me ballistic With you, three lines of dialogue are just sadistic Give me air, sweep it away. Shift into action Do Mr. Bean Meets Fassbinder Don't give me that crap What's that? Luc Besson? And Jean-Marc Barr... Why not Jeanne Balibar? This has gone too far... Precisely. Why not Jeanne Balibar? You fat dickhead! Shit! Tie her down! Sorry, but she's always underfoot. Do something, take care of me... What d'you want? Ice cream. You already got creamed. Haven't had enough? You can be such a jerk. I have my moments. Is that all you can do is say, who's to blame? There you go with your movie star hysterics! You dream of being an actor but you don't dare admit it. Because your ego is so humongous you won't admit you want it. You're dying to be an actor. JoeyStarr: It's no accident that that's your stage name. What'd your mother name you? Didier Morville! Okay, to each his world. Later. At 40, making teenagers go wild, singing: "Put your gun down"! - Finished? - No, that's not all. That's true, too. The French music scene was waiting for JoeyStarr! You're gonna get it. Nice. This at the Farm Fair? That's Blier's movie, dimwit! Who's producing it? I dunno. Not you anyway. It's good, but it needs a girl with some glamor... They're all glamorous, thank you. Karin Viard, Mélanie... She's glamorous, but... Someone more popular, you see. Karin Viard is very popular. Popular with who? - Your cinephiles? - Come off it! She makes popular movies. And Julie Depardieu won two Césars! Popular is a girl who makes the cover of Paris Match or Gala, magazines that sell. Hit on models, for instance, who are doing movies. There are good ones. Take Estelle Lefébure. She's no dope. Try to meet her. Get off your ass. Call her. To say what? "Hi, Estelle, my name's Maiwenn. "I'm doing a documentary on actresses. "You're no actress. You sell face cream, but I'm game!" What do you mean, no actress? What's with this dumb Parisian snobbery? It's not snobbery. Excuse me, but there's nothing more... - It is exactly snobbery. - How tacky can you get! That's St. Tropez, her boyfriend, what's his name... Johnny Hallyday and that gang. Come on! What about my image? What image? Honestly, I have a trendy image. The underground press... I don't want to look ridiculous. - Seen her movies? - What movies? She's done movies. Name one film she's done! It escapes me. Haha, it escapes you! If you shoot with Estelle, I'll produce you. I'll pay you, I'll back you. How much? Actually, you're known without being known. That depends. I'm pretty well known. But not as an actress. I'm starting to be. That's your point of view. You're rather known as a top model, or whosit's wife... What I want is the viewpoint of a woman struggling to make a name as an actress, not a beauty product. We're filming. Can you take off your glasses? Not today. A documentary's not a commercial. No, it sure isn't a commercial. Do you think you're a good actress? That would be presumptuous, but I'll do everything to become one. Give me a straight yes. The point isn't to... I'm working... at it. It takes work to be an actress? In any case there's a lot of work to do. It doesn't just come like that. You don't care about your physique. That's not true. I'm even very vain, in my own way. When people say actresses can't get a role after a certain age, they answer: "Not true, look at Charlotte Rampling!“ - Is that why you want to film me? - Not at all. It's amazing you don't try to look younger. Okay... Beddy-bye. Enough. You ate already? Playing by yourself? I got a little tired of it. - You didn't get groceries? - Did you? Come take my boots off, please. - Did you forget? - What? Dinner at Jennifer's. I'm too tired to go out. So am I. But we said we'd go, so we're going. You change your mind sometimes. Sure, but sometimes I can also change yours. I'm too tired. So, are we going? Okay. 1000 now, 1000 later, if you behave. How much is there? 2000 in all? - You heard me. - Okay. I'm ready. What? They're not chicken thieves. Go change. Go on. You're awful! Mélanie Doutey had... Where'd I see that? I heard she had lots of plastic surgery. Didn't she have her mouth redone? Like, a friend of mine told me she saw Isabelle Adjani making out with Edouard Baer. I swear! I promise you! Can you imagine? Not giving your man a boner anymore? Excuse me? How do you feel not giving your man a boner anymore? It's been over a year. You have a hidden camera? I read her diary. - What are you getting at? - You laugh about Adjani and all, but not about yourselves. It's too private? Same goes for them. At the dentists, you grab the celebrity rags. Like everyone else. You the new Sofia Coppola? No, Miss Smartass Underground. People like her work hard all day, and reading that stuff, it relaxes them to see they have the same problems. You're Miss Morality, very chic! Everyone's not into your thing: coming home at night and watching this heavy stuff on TV. You know, the Dardenne brothers! Screw 'em! I watch Star Academy, a popcorn comedy. I'm like her. It doesn't say "crooner" up here. This won't work. I can't imagine having someone underfoot all the time. What's the point of filming me reading or sleeping? It'd be different if I were playing a character. Tell yourself you're playing a character: - Charlotte Rampling. - That's not my thing. Good luck, Maiwenn. You okay? - We'll talk at halftime? - Sure. It's 0-0. They won! They won! So what'd that wacko say? Who do you mean? Old Mother Rampling. She said no. I used all the arguments I could, nothing doing. You try everything? Alright, come in. Having more experience doesn't mean you're right. Maybe I'm not adventurous enough. You want to get me involved? You want to change me or what? I want to reveal you to yourself. Reveal me to myself? You're always into deep things. Culture, literature! It doesn't exactly make me unhappy. It doesn't exactly make you happy, either. I don't have your culture or experience, that's for sure. But I can give you my buoyancy and joy of life. Live again, yes, I mean to live again. Live again, live forever more. I was once deeply loved In a wordless love A love that was my crown. Live again, I mean to live again. I sowed with tenderness To reap my passion. I never let happiness in the door Without a thorough search. Live again, I mean to live again. What am I talking about? What keeps moving inside me. Live again, I mean to live again. What am I talking about? About what never stops: Time. Give time the time, That's something you learn. Let's give time the time To tame it an instant. Let's go! Are you stalling? What if you kissed Estelle? - What? - You don't see what I'm saying? Kiss her, not a movie kiss, but a real French kiss! Everyone wants to kiss Estelle, even Julie! Even me. Really? Come on, let's go! Action! I'm doing this for you. Don't bother then, I'll do it myself. Got any winning breath spray? Go on, Estelle! You can do it. And there's a producer watching. There we go. That's good! With your tongues! Estelle's good at it. Holy shit! To think you complained! We wanted just a kiss, not foreplay. You mind sitting down? They won't let up! Okay, that's enough! - We're having fun. - You're not at the movies. Hey, relax. I'll play with your head, you'll see. And best of all, an extraordinary little detail... this telephone unhides hidden callers. It's Martin Scorsese. This way, thank you. Thank you, gentlemen. Here's to Nokia! - These your shoes? - What? Those sequined shoes. They're gorgeous! Yeah, princess shoes. The wardrobe's on loan. Do the dresses belong to Romane? On loan, too? And you work for the telephone or... The telephone and... And you use actresses to sell phones? It's common practice. What's she paid? That I can't tell you. - How much are you paid, Romane? - None of your business. She'll tell me anyway. Wanna be in my film? Spit it out. So that's how you buy actresses. Charming! Ah, the myth destroyed. People don't know that everything is on loan. What's this envelope? Could you stop filming now? We're almost done. Miss, please stand aside and stop filming. Is this the mafia or what? This seems right. For this, I was paid about 20,000 euros. Tell me what you've been doing. What have you been up to since I last saw you? Last time you were on a roll. Yes, but... I met a Danish director. Doing anything in France, big movies like before? No big movies... But I'm auditioning next week for a terrific movie. Whose? The Yvan Attal movie. I think you're not alone. I hear he's seeing lots of actresses. Maybe, I don't know. - Is that it? - What? - For your film? - Of course. But don't expect it to change your career. I'm glad to be in it, it'll do me good. There're lots of other girls. Once, when my phone used to ring It was always someone asking If I'd be part of an art film cast And roles I couldn't let pass. There was no stopping me I was shooting constantly But now everything seems Like I'm swimming upstream. I've played 1001 girls I've peered into their souls I gave them my youthful charms Like you rush into a man's arms I thought I was a little kid Who wanted to play and always did And I played from fall to spring Before I was nothing more Than an actress as actresses are But now the wheel has turned And I feel forgotten and spurned. How did it come to pass? Have I lost my appeal and class? The world was mine and grand I held it in the palm of my hand Show your profile. This one? Smile. Face forward. Let's see the expression of a sad mother. Other side, other profile. Okay, that'll do for now. I'll show them to him, and if he wants to see you, we'll call. But... Things aren't easy right now... True, your agent insisted that I see you. No, wait! I'm fond of you so it's normal. But Yvan originally wanted Mélanie Doutey. Now he wants an unknown. That's crazy! I audition, and people tell me: "You're too well-known." At another audition, people tell me: "You're not famous enough." Known, unknown... It's not my fault. Make up your minds. I learned 5 pages of lines! I told your agent not to give them to you, because I knew how things might go, and didn't want to waste your time. Someone unexpected? An actress? - You're used to it. - But it might bother the actress. It's already ridiculous and appalling. - I came for the audition. - This way. Go on! Shit, what's the matter? What's wrong? What a lot of crap! It's crap. Stop it! That was my only audition in months. But you told me you had... I don't have a thing. Nothing! You were waiting for calls. It was bullshit, can't you tell? That event you saw me do... I do 10 a month so people see my face and think I'm fine. If you look depressed, people will say, "She's depressed, we can't use her." You have to be pretty and act... like in the closet, act like nothing's the matter. Then they say, "She's really swell." But it doesn't matter, there are worse things. But this time was a little much. There goes Yvan. He's going to the office. This is it, kid! If he auditions me... You want to audition, too? Sure you don't want to? Because while we're at it... Can I film you a bit? Yeah, but it's not... - You're an actress, too? - But I'm directing now. "Now I know "I want to be with you. "I can manage even without your daddy. "I want you to forgive me. "Please, forgive me, my love." You're great, bravo. I'll be right there. Not me. You're filming actresses. Tell me the truth: How was she? She was great. - Will you take her? - I don't know. - Come on! - I don't know. Whether he takes me or not, I'm so happy I was able to do that! At least you'll be judged by your work. Goddam! I can't believe it! - This is Dinesh. - I can't believe it! Dinesh, this is Maiwenn. She's my friend. Say hello. Isn't he exquisite? - How old is he? - A year and 4 months. Look at this little darling. - How are you doing? - I'm doing okay. Is your film going well? Your adoption threw us for a loop. Did you think this through? I didn't think at all. I saw him, I knew he was the one! It's weird to be back. You happy, too? You feel my excitement? We'll go to the market there. That's the church. That's the newsstand. Is that Yvan's movie? He cast Romane Bohringer? Could you stop, please. Mélanie, isn't this sort of a lesson to you? A lesson in what? No lessons, but look... Remember that lunch. You didn't give a shit. No, Attal went about it all wrong. He didn't make a pitch. He begged. He buttered me up like a jerk. Admit it... you didn't make much of an effort. We're so happy. Yes, my love. Tell me again. I'm very happy. Children, would you like a little brother or sister? I'd love one! How sweet! Don't cry, everything's fine. I waited for you all my life. Estelle... My love... What's the matter? You were out there! Way out! What? You kept saying, "Estelle, my love." What's with you? I said Estelle? Yes, you said, "Estelle, my love. Estelle..." That's enough. Very funny. So what was it? I don't know. Maybe... I think I'm under her spell. Here we go! What crap! Good night. Honest. What'd they do to you when you were a kid? I think about her all the time. So let's hear it. I want to see her all the time, talk to her for hours... She gets to me. She's so... You saw this chick twice in your life, so cut it out! That's enough. Remember you and me. - Meaning? - We fell in love right off. You're in love? Yeah, I think I'm in love. Quit playing with my head! In love? You got a screw loose? She's a chick! You're not in love with a chick! Cut it out. You can be both. Oh, you can? Go on. Go eat some pussy, because you're freaking me out. Go on! You can leave, you hit the jackpot! Pack your bags. - Kiss our son. - And you, kiss her snatch. I dream of Biarritz in the summer light I watch the girls' skin change color. I see the blue skies hold you tight. And suddenly I'm in love with you. I dream of you and me hand in hand... I'm not in love with you. It was just an experience. An experience? Come on... Your turn. Don't be silly. Why did you fall in love with Joey? When I was doing my show, JoeyStarr came to see me at the theater. He waited for me backstage. I fell in love with him because there was huge gap between his reputation and what he was really like. A few years later I wanted to write. I wanted to make a movie about my father. I talked to people about it, everyone said I was crazy... Oh shit! That I didn't have a producer, that! first had to get it financed... That I was putting the cart before the horse. Right! And... Joey was the only person who told me I wasn't crazy. Who said, "Go for it! "You're right." That's why I loved him. That's why with him, I had the feeling it was my right to give up being an actress, and that's what got it all moving. That's why I loved him. I felt he understood me. I felt he understood me. Didier! What is it? What is it? I'm sorry. Maiwenn told us she was doing a documentary on actresses, not a documentary on Maiwenn. She said she didn't want to be in the film. Charlotte, frankly, you have a few minutes in the film, and you're marvelous... I really don't think... It sucks! We got sold this pitch: "We'll film the real lives of actresses..." There's one actress on screen, if you can call her that... Are you a professional wimp or an amateur wimp? She wanted to come full circle, finish the first film, focus the film more on her own family relations and I think it serves the documentary. It serves the box office! 15 actresses to sell the film! I'll tell you, she cut me out of her first film, calls me back, and now cuts me out again. She's a big fat slut. And I'm glad she cut me, because for her it's pathetic. She's the one who'll suffer. Seriously, it's good news we were cut, really... It's just her face... She's dishonest! She's not even here. Cut it out! I told her things I'd never told anyone, and what do we see...? Karole, you wear me out. Who do you think you are to talk like that? You're lucky to be in it. When did you last make a movie? So please, pipe down. It'll help you to appear in this film. What are you talking about? Help me out how? Help me out how? That's it! I don't give a shit! Let's go for a drink. - I'm ashamed to be in it. - I don't see why. Ashamed of what? We're lucky not to be in it. Take our names off. You don't get it? It's shit! I've had enough, understand! And I'm ashamed to tell her because she was my friend! Look, let's go... It's all the same to me. Unbelievably boring. Abysmally boring. I don't think the film will come out. I think we're looking at a dozen lawsuits. I think we're up shit creek. Do you hear what I said? You don't give a damn? I don't give a damn. Well, I'm off. "For you, June 15, 2002" Explosion behind! Look out, a giant spider!
