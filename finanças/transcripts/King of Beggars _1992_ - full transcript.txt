Chan, this is Uncle Cheng He will be the examiner Say hello to Uncle Cheng How are you, Uncle Cheng? See Doesn't he seem to be the winner? It depends on the fate Cheng, I've asked someone to finish the papers which you gave me Will the questions be changed? Don't worry about the question paper But about the test of arrows shooting, riding, boxing and weapons... He should try his best Don't worry My son is keen in martial arts So, can I deduct some from the payment of 2 million taels? We are friends, but that is business Let the Horse teams be the pioneer The arrows teams go side ways, the gunmen stay back The candidates come in I can't lift it I don't want to waste my force Shameless? Damn you! Oh, 10 marks The final race now starts The candidates, Po Ye Tat Tor from Mongolia Bravo... And So Cha Ha Yee Chan from Canton Last call So, one to ten Po, one to one Are you kidding, how can the betting rates differ so much? One to ten for Chan? Kidding? Why don't you have faith in Chan? That is, Chan defaulted in weight lifting Look, Po entered the final race with full marks, it differs It's an examination of the Scholar of Martial Arts, not king of coolie It's meaningless to be the champion of weight lifting - You shouldn't put it that way - What? He is smart I've studied this race for a long time I feel strange about the rate too Po is smart and strong But see the sweat of his neck I think it's because he is getting tired Really? But this So What do you thing? He has been disappointing the audience But he has achieved very hard What? He tried very hard So I want to bet on him How much do you want to bet? 800,000 taels Why not 2 million taels? What? Why are you so optimistic about Chan? You have good analyze I feel Chan will be the champion Come on I want to bet more on him Really? 2 million taels! How generous! Why don't you bet? Why should I bet? He is my son Shit, I miss one thing out of my calculation What? The blood Here comes the Examiner What? Isn't Cheng the examiner? Please take a seat Seng-ko-lin-ch'in?! What's the problem? He is the uncle of Po Let's start Start! They should act 2 more marks for that powerful shoot I do think so So's arrow isn't on the target, Po won this section Kidding? Damn you! They are cheating The candidates please get on the horses Mr Chiu Take these with you, may be you will find them useful Here comes the 2nd round They trick again It's corrupt! May I give up the betting? Chan won this race Did you tear the ticket? Not yet Are you kidding? Once again?! OK, let's start from the very beginning, I'll fight with single hand and leg I won't take your advantage How can you use such dirty stance? Have you waken? Bravo! He won Have some tea All the best! What did you say? It's English There is no regulation stating that weapon is not allowed You fell down first, Po is the winner again Damn you Cheng! You betrayed me! I will beat you to death if I see you again Forget it, you won't see him anymore Why? I am now going to kill him! I don't have 2 million to lose! Just kidding You shameless Po is the Scholar of Martial Arts I did win! Objection What are you doing? The dart is poisoned He deserves it!

But it's dislike from the standard stances! It's quite powerful! He broke the waddy! He broke the treasure of our Association, let's kill him! I am Master Hung, who dares go against me? I set the rules of the association Any student who defeated the Lotus Position could be the leader Have you all forgotten? We becomes the biggest association because of being united I left you the "Dog Hitting Waddy", is just for memory The waddy is meaningless But you fools take this as treasure And fight among yourselves for this damn waddy! In these five years, you have had no leader, don't you feel shy? So Chan broke the waddy, so you won't fight for this anymore He is correct to do so This youngster is so junior, but he is a genius, a smart ass He is being taught by my disciple Hung Yat Sun Who doesn't respect him is going against me too You should respect him, your new leader, and you'd love him, whole-heartedly, to care much for him, maybe, treat him dinner Then, although I am in heaven, I will bless all of you, all the best Isn't it true?
