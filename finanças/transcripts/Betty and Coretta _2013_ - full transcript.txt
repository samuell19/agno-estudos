And earthquake and a hurricane may have delayed this day. But this is a day that would not be denied. For this day, we celebrate Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's return to the National Mall. I never thought I'd live to see this day. A monument to Martin Luther King dedicated by our first African-American President on the National Mall. It was a long struggle. But America, all of us, together, we got there because of Martin and so many others like him. I remember dear brother Malcolm, how the corners of his mouth turned up when his smile and his devilish laugh. You know? And then there were their wives. They carried on in their struggle even after their men were... were... Were... were gunned down in cold blood. I mean, they were a sisterhood, born of sorrow, yes. But it became a sisterhood of greatness. It's Betty and Coretta I remember the most. When Martin was jailed during the fight for voting rights, Coretta rushed down to Selma, Alabama to be by his side. It was there that she met Malcolm for the first and only time. Then we'll take it off. Yeah. I'd like to think the folks in this part of the world would do well to listen to Dr. Martin Luther King, and give him what he is asking for, before some other faction comes along and takes it some other way. What he wants is the balance. And it is a right. And it will be gotten one way or the other. Now I believe in nonviolence if a person is nonviolent with me. But if my enemy does not believe in nonviolence, then practicing nonviolence then, in my opinion, is a waste of time. If the sick that dog on you, you shoot it. Understand me? Mrs. King. Malik. I know you by the name Malcolm. Well, you didn't know I changed it then. I guess they called you down here to the church when they heard I was coming, huh? You know it's irresponsible to talk the way you do. We got enough problems down here without you showing up and bringing us more. I didn't come here to make trouble. I'm here to support Dr. King. You should thank me. And so should he. If his enemies wind have given him what he wants, it's only because I scared the pants off them. And if we wind up fighting amongst ourselves over strategy and lose sight of the bigger picture, who do we thank then? I agree. We need to be self empowered. We need a strong sense of pride in ourselves and our history. That's why I'm asking Dr. King to link up his struggle with that about black and brown brothers and sisters in Africa and the rest of the world. Well, shouldn't we deal with our own fires in this country before we go putting out others? You're missing the point. Oh, am I? We get those countries to censor ours in the United Nations and you'll see some real change down here real fast. We push for that, we risk bringing down Johnson. And no other President has done more for us. If he's that great, why is your husband in jail right now? My husband has faith, as do I, that right will triumph in men's hearts. Well, someone has faith. That's for sure. I'm glad I met you, Mrs. King. I can see where Dr. King gets his strength. Minister. I was rude of earlier. Thank you for coming. How are you holding on? I hate it here. Oh, I know. Never gets any easier, does it? How are the children? Worried. They wanted to come down. Edith's with them. You should see the support you're getting. All the news stations are down here. Backers are in town. Even Malcolm X came. To glorify himself, no doubt. That man gives the struggle a bad name. I don't know. He's seemed different in person. Even changed his name. He refuses to disavow violence. We need the White man to make any progress in this country. And threatening him with violence is not the answer. I think he's softening. In his heart, he wants what we want. I think it's possible that he could come around given time. I sure hope you're right, for all of our sake. Go to sleep, sweetie. Close your eyes. Go to sleep. What you doing up still? Time to get you to bed. Go on now. Tom, won't you head home? Malcolm told me to stay and watch you all. Nothing's going to happen tonight. Now go on. Sister Antoinette's going want you home. I'll see you in the morning. Two such beautiful girls. Now get straight to sleep, OK? Stay in bed. Oh, Malcolm. You scared me. I parked a couple of blocks away just to be safe. Daddy. Daddy. Attallah. Daddy. Qubilah, come over here. Daddy. No time to be sleeping. Daddy's home. I missed you both. You miss me? Yes. I just put them to bed and you riling them all up again. Oh, come on. Who wants some ice cream? - I do. - I do. Yeah, let's go. I got something for you girls. Wow. What is it? It's Big Ben. It's a giant clock in England. It's for your sisters too. And this here is England's national anthem. That's where I got this, London, England. It's where I got to see the real Big Ben. Did you visit the queen in her castle? No. Daddy didn't get the meat this time, he was too busy. But one day. Now, go to bed. I love you. You know they wouldn't let me into Paris. Made me turn back to London. I'm sure the FBI had their fingers all over that. Stay home. Stop all this traveling. The girls need you here. I need you. I can't. If I'm going to introduce that new resolution at the UN sanctioning this country, I need to find other nations willing to stand up against dollarism. It's not easy. Once they drop those dollars on you, your soul goes. I don't care about any of that. We got one month in his house before the courts take it from us. And then what? This is all the girls have ever known. Where we going to go? We got no money. We got nothing. Elijah Muhammad gave us this house and I plan to keep it. He didn't give us this house. It's his house. He only let us live here because you were preaching for the nation. And when he kicked you out, he kicked you out of his house too. What you expect? You put the man down in public every chance you get. I'll stop putting him down when he apologizes to the young mothers of all those children he had out of wedlock. He should get down on his knees and beg forgiveness for seducing them. Malcolm, his men are calling him every day threatening to kill you. Anything happens to me, my new organization of Muslim brothers will take care of you and our family. Your new organization of Muslim brothers can barely afford to keep their offices open. I'm supposed to rely on them? Malcolm, I need a job. No. The woman's place is in the home with the kids. Well, we need somewhere safe to raise our kids. You'll get it soon enough. After I'm gone. - Don't talk like that. - Well, why not? I'm practically a dead man. I don't want to hear it. I don't want to hear it. You know what it's true. They're going to kill me, Betty. Hell, I'd kill me too after some of the things I said about Elijah and the nation. What are we supposed to do without you? We've already been through this. There's a destiny for all of us. Nothing can keep us from it. Anyway, as long as I'm here, I'm going to enjoy my ice cream. My sweet brown sugar, I wish I had more to give you. So what do you think? A boy? Fifth time's a charm? I don't know. But if it is, he's waiting to see his daddy. And you better be there for him. What you trying to do? Make more babies. As many as possible. Before going to London, I traveled down to see Dr. King. They wouldn't let me in the prison, but I did get to see Mrs. King. Really? Yeah, she's a strong sister. Not as strong as you though. I went to Tuskegee too. Your old alma mater invited me to speak. I got scared of him. I bet you did. Oh, Tuskegee. I remember back in Detroit when my mama put me on a train and go down there. I was just 17 and on my way to college for the first time. And I was so sheltered up until then. We were on a station platform. And there she was, this woman who loved me all my life struggling to tell me what I find when I got there. Honest White folks showing their true racism. Yeah. Yeah, it was the first time I ever seen her at a loss for words. I didn't understand until I got there. You know, I couldn't believe the people I didn't even know could hate me so much. Mm-hmm. I didn't know how to react until I met you. I'm sorry for everything. Go. Go. Go. Hit 'em now. Mommy. Daddy. Mommy. What is it? Get up. Get up! Get the babies. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Stay with me. Go with your mom. Go with your mom. Come on. Come here. Come here. Come here. Hey, girls. Oh. Come on, I got to talk to you. I've arranged for Tom to take you and the kids back to stay with him and sister Antoinette. What? What about you? I've got to go to the airport. I've got a speech in Detroit. Today? I'm not going to be scared away. Malcolm, the kids need you. They are terrified. They don't know what's happening. It's too dangerous here. It's worse for them if I stay here with you. Things are going to change soon. We'll get a new house, someplace safe. Just think about the future. That's where our hope lies. With what they could salvage from the fire, Betty and the kids moved in with Tom and his wife Antoinette. We called her Tony. A week went by. They were getting threatening calls day and night. And still, they always answered the phone hoping it would be Malcolm on the line. - Hello? - Hey, Tony. It's Malcolm. Can I speak to Betty, please? Just a minute. Malcolm. Hey, how are you doing? How are the girls? Missing you. Me too. Some good news. I spoke to my sister Ella about helping with the house. She said that she'd paid the down payment and put it in her name since no one to sell to me. Oh, that's great, honey. Whatever it takes. Whatever it takes. I just want us to be together again. What is it? What is it? Some coward called this morning and said, wake up, brother. Sounded like a White man trying to put fear into my heart and into the hearts of everyone who follows me. I can't let them do that. I have to leave now to preach up in Harlem. Would it bother you to bring the girls? Of course not. I love you, Betty. I... I love you too. He wants us to come to the Autobahn. Oh, sister Betty, that's wonderful. Tom. I heard. I'll drive you there. We better get a move on or you'll be late. Oh, thank you so much. You go on. I'll take care of the baby. Thank you, sister Antoinette. Thank you. I come to these things all the time. All the time. Assalamu alaikum, brothers and sisters. Get your hand of my pocket. Hold it. Hold it. Don't get excited. Let's stay cool, brothers. Everything is going to be all right. I was afraid something like this would happen. Nothing good can ever come from preaching violence. That is such a loss. They say his wife's pregnant. Oh, the poor woman. Martin, we have to reach out to her. I've already made a statement to the press. Something more personal. Hate leads to more and more hate. Those are Malcolm supporters burning down the nation's mosque. Today in Harlem. The burning of a Nation a Islam mosques. Serves them right for what the Nation done to him. Dark and twisted Malcolm X, who used his extraordinary genius for evil intent. Nation of Islam spokesperson Louis Farrakhan was... Their religion wasn't nothing but four senior citizens and a beat up, old station wagon. Now look at all of them. Malcolm didn't know what he was playing with. No, he didn't. He didn't know what he was playing with. You just don't jump up against a divine messenger of God like he did. He has to die. And God obliged to it. Talk like that's what brother Malcolm killed. Minister Farrakhan's trying to take his own position in the Nation. He got them all riled up and now look what's happened. I can't stand to see it. I just want to keep all this away from my kids. They'll be able to see how much their daddy meant to people at the funeral. They're not going. What? They're not going. I couldn't protect them from seeing their father killed. I couldn't protect them from seeing their house burned down. I'm going to protect them now. Sister Betty. Keeping them safe, that's what's important. That's more important than anything. Here at this final hour in this quiet place, Harlem has come to bid farewell to one of its brightest hopes. Extinguished now and gone from us forever. Malcolm was our manhood, our living Black manhood. And in honoring him, we honor the best in ourselves. However, we may have... Just look at her, Tom. She's got no money, no home and she's pregnant. What's going to happen to her? Sister Betty, I brought you some tea. Oh, thank you, sister. The telegram came. It's from Martin Luther King Jr. Read it. I was certainly saddened by the shocking and tragic assassination of your husband. While we did not always see eye to eye on methods to solve the race problem, I always had a deep affection for Malcolm. He was an eloquent spokesman for his point of view. And no one can honestly doubt that Malcolm had a great concern for the problems that we face as a race. While I know that this is a difficult hour for you... I am sure that God will give you the strength to endure. I will certainly be remembering you in my prayers. And please know that you have my deepest sympathy. Always considered me a friend. And if I can do anything to ease the heavy load that you are forced to carry at this time... Please feel free to call on me. Martin Luther King Jr. He should have values him when he meant something. After Malcolm died it felt like the whole nation was in a fever. Students protested the war in Vietnam. Watts burned, then Detroit. The Black Panthers preached revolution using Malcolm's early speeches to justify their actions. And Betty, well, she... She... she had her hands full just raising six girls. That's right. The boy she and Malcolm never came. Instead, they got twin girls. We all helped her. And with the royalties from Malcolm's autobiography, we were able to raise enough to please a down payment on a home in Mount Vernon. A nice home away from the city where Barry could give her children a sheltered life she had dreamed of. Hello? In here. Trying to make some clothes for the kids. Then I came just in time. Oh, they've gotten so big. What's all this? I took up a collection. Oh, bless you, sister Antoinette. Look at you. Oh, look at you. You look good. Girl, please. I'm run ragged. I got diapers and daycare up to here. I feel like the old woman in the shoe. Oh, this will be nice for Qubilah. Mm-hmm. Oh, this is pretty one. Yeah, I like that one too. Oh, I love these. So how you doing up here in suburbia? It's all right. Except every time a neighbor see us, they think we're going to blow something up. Well, you're lucky to be up here. In Harlem, there's fighting every day. It's like Malcolm said, the chickens are coming home to roost. He wouldn't like that. He preached self-defense. He was for peace and self empowerment through knowledge. Violence was always a last resort. You should get out there. Tell people who he really was. No, there's other ways I can be a service. Volunteering, helping people. That's what I'm doing now. These are the startling images from Memphis yesterday where civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. had come to a rally was striking sanitation workers for better wages. The so-called nonviolent march quickly got out of hand. And King and his cohorts had to flee for safety, leaving his power and influence within the movement he created very much in doubt. President Johnson offered federal... Yes. Your husband's a coward and a hypocrite. He's next. Who are you? Why do you hate him so? Martin? Martin. They called again, didn't they? And they're calling me a coward. They're saying I'm responsible. And Martin Luther King's non-violence is causing violence. They're wrong. You're the one trying to make sense out of all this chaos. Maybe I let it all go to my head. A Nobel Prize, the march on Washington. I thought I changed the world. I look back and I don't feel like I accomplished much. You have. Not fast enough. Not after what happened in Memphis. There are folks that are saying they don't even want me to come back. And maybe they're right not to. People want answers, Cori. And then I don't know if I have them anymore. You always said this struggle would take a long time. And that the way wouldn't be easy. People need you, Martin. Never underestimate the value of your leadership. What is the secret of your faith in me? How is it that you believe in me more than I believe in myself? Because you're a vessel for greatness. I've known it from the instant we met. Thank you. Let's hurry and get inside. Oh. All right, don't let it get wet. Will Daddy be home from Memphis by then? Why? I want him to see it too. Oh. Come Easter, your daddy will be wherever he needs to be. Patience. Patience. I'm coming. Hello. Coretta, it's Jesse. Oh, Jesse. Oh, just one moment. Yoki, what did I say? I just want to say it one more time. Jesse, so tell me. How's everything going? Doc, just got shot. Mamma? Go put that dress away. Coretta, you there? Coretta? Go on. It's bad, Cori. He's gone. Martin Luther King dedicated his life to love and to justice between fellow human beings. He died from the cause of that effort. In this difficult day, in this difficult time for the United States... I was in my room. I heard the shot. By the time I got there, he was already gone. He spoke so strongly that night at Memphis. What an inspiration. He had a premonition and he still didn't back down. We can make an effort as Martin Luther King did to understand and to comprehend. Senator Kennedy's offered a private plane to fly you down to get Martin. And Harry Belafonte called and said he was on his way to Atlanta. What's happening with the march in Memphis? That's been canceled. We need to go ahead with it. They're rioting across the country. We have to do something. We have to show that the way to deal with Martin's assassination is through nonviolence. We need to consecrate his legacy. And what about the death threats? Nothing's going to happen. How do you know that? Because I'll be right by your side. And so will the children. It's what Martin would have wanted. OK. Just four days after her husband's assassination, seeking to heal a wounded and grieving nation, a dignified and composed Coretta Scott King, widow of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr, Together with three of her four children, led a silent and peaceful march of over 21,000 through downtown Memphis today. The very city where her husband was so ruthlessly gunned down. Continuing his work, she called for economic justice for the city's Black sanitation workers and an end to racism. After Martin's death, Coretta worked hard to keep his causes alive. She thought the best way to do it was to get a national holiday to honor him. Betty worked hard. She was always volunteering. Oh, I'm so sorry. Oh, sister Betty. When are you going to learn to be on time? I was helping some of my young sisters enrol they're kids in preschool. Then I just thought by my councilman's office. Can you believe it? Another round of budget cuts. When the taxpayers going to learn? Pay a little now or a whole lot later. What? Is not funny. I wasn't laughing at you. I'm just wondering what Malcolm would say if he saw you running around like this with all these causes. He always wanted you to stay at home. I do whatever I can to help out the sisters. Oh, there's a good spot. Listen, uh, you've heard about this Black political convention in Gary, Indiana? Yes. They asked me to speak at it. So you're going, right? Oh, I don't think so. All those radicals. They twisted everything Malcolm stood for to justify their actions. It's not just radicals who are going. It's the whole Black community. It'll be a historic event. The first of its kind. If you don't go and speak up for who Malcolm really was, those radical groups will claim him. And you'll lose your man for good. This is your chance to set the record straight. Coretta's going to represent Martin. Mamma, do you really have to go? Don't worry, Qubilah. I'll be back in a few days. All right? Why do you have to leave it all? I have to go for daddy. Qubilah, honey, mamma's going to be OK. You can trust me on that. All right? Give me a hug. I love you. I love you too. See you later. The Black National Political Convention was something else. Over 10,000 people showed up. It seemed like everyone was there. Reverend Jackson, Amiri Baraka, Shirley Chisholm, even Minister Farrakhan. I remember Betty had a place of honor on stage right beside Coretta. It was the first time they met. Mrs. Coretta Scott King. I'm glad to see you all here. And I know my husband would have been glad as well. As you know, we live in a nation trouble with the triple evils of racism, war and poverty. We need to address these issues and we need to address them now. That's why I would like to say a special word to the women in the audience. We are a powerful force. And our nation's greatest untapped resource. Together, with men, we can repair our injured society. With our faith and our determination, we can build new hope, establish new communities, construct new cities, create a new nation. Yes! Yes, form a new world, a just world. A world dedicated to families and equality for all. A world of peace. And now, someone who's making sure that we all can walk in survival when we go with Malcom X. Let's welcome sister Betty Shabazz. Thank you. I think it's wonderful to see so many Black face out there today. I know that for many of you, my husband's words by any means necessary have become a rallying cry for violent overthrow. But that's not who he was. During his pilgrimage to Mecca, he met many people. And not just Black ones. People from all races, all backgrounds, people who were kind to him. That was an education. He valued education and the truth that came with it. I'm the truth, he once said, no matter who tells it. I'm for justice, no matter who it's for or against. I am human being first and foremost. And as such, I am for whoever and whatever benefits humanity as a whole. Now I know that's not Malcolm some of you know or associate my husband's memory with it. But that is who he was. And it's who we should all aspire to be. Thank you. It was a beautiful speech. I'm sure a lot of people were surprised to hear it coming from you. Well, it's not what they thought about Malcolm. I suppose it's easy to assume things about people. Yes. I been watching you on TV. Admiring you. Envying you too. People love you and your husband. You know, I met your husband in Selma just before he died. He told me. He said you were a strong sister. He said that? He made a point of it. Well, how about that? I half way suspected when he complimented me, he was just trying to curry favor with Martin. Oh, Malcolm curried favor with no one. Your husband did something important. He gave our people a sense of power and pride. He showed us that Black could be beautiful and strong. Less threatening to a lot of people. I was surprised by how his death affected me. For weeks, I walked around with a pain in my chest and a sense of depression, as if I had lost someone dear to me. I wish we had had the chance to bring Martin and Malcolm together. They could have been a real force for reconciliation and healing. Great things could have happened. Betty, things are really going to change now. You should be a part of it. I got six kids to raise and nothing to offer. But that's not true. You're a strong woman. You must know that? I'm so glad we had this chance to talk together. I hope we can stay in touch. Me too. Are you all right? Minister Farrakhan? That man is responsible for my husband's death. I can't prove it. But I know is true. I know how you feel. I never believed James Earl Ray acted alone when he killed Martin. There were things that were never investigated. They don't want us to know the truth. So much was taken away from us and our kids. They may have killed our husbands, Betty. But they didn't kill their ideas. Those are still alive. What's important now is for to carry them forward. Come on. Over the next few years, we made progress. The number of African-American elected officials more than doubled. And Coretta continued to fight for social justice and a national holiday for Martin. Betty, she went back to school. It was tough with six kids, but we all helped out. We wanted her to... We needed her to succeed. And she did. Armed with her PhD, she got her first job at Medgar Evers College in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Hey, you think because twice your age I can't relate? Girlfriend, I've been where you at. You don't need a man to survive. You just need some training so you can get a good job, take care of yourself and your baby. You understand? Good. Now here. Here, take this to pay for child childcare. And get here on time tomorrow. OK? Don't say a word. People helped me when I needed it. Just pass it along. Go on. They said it, but I didn't believe it. The widow of Malcolm X coming to Crown Heights to teach at the school honoring my husband. Myrlie Evers? Myrlie Evers. Oh, my gosh. It's so... it's an honor. Honor to meet you. Honor. Honor is mine. So what made you want to work here? Well, you remember the documentary on Malcolm? It was about three years ago. Well, I took my girls to see it and it was hard to watch. My daughter Qubilah said something to me. She said, Mommy, you look so helpless in the movie. And she was right. That's exactly how I felt. I understand that feeling. I never want to feel that way again. I just want to help others. So what about you? How did you keep moving after your husband's death? Well, with Medgar, we knew for years they'd become in to kill him eventually. Even joked about it. But nothing can prepare you for the reality when it happens. It takes a long time to heal. A part of you never really does. But then again, life... Is that an engagement ring? Yeah. I'm getting remarried in two months. Really? Yes. Oh, I'm so happy for you. Thank you. Wow. How about you? Is there a man in your life? Only one, Malcolm. No! Get away! Mamma! What? What is it, baby? Mommy! What? They're here to kill you! No one's going to hurt me. Nothing's going to happen. I saw a man! You were dreaming. You were dreaming, sweetheart. Why didn't you tell us Daddy's killers were still out there? What are you talking about? I saw an interview on TV. They said Daddy's real killers were still on the loose. That's just stories, baby. That's just stories. Look, no one's going to take anything away from us every again. You hear me? You are so smart and so beautiful, you're going to have a great future. You and your sisters are going to make something of yourself. I know you will. Just focused on that, OK? Hold on. Hold on. Martin, Dexter, no horseplay. Hi. Well, hello there. Is your mamma here? She's learning the bus stop. Well, is that so? Oh. Hey, girl. Betty. Oh, I'm so glad to see you. We made it. Oh, girl, let me see these beauties. You must be Dexter. Martin. Bernice and Yolanda. Did I get that right? You sure did. And yours are? Attallah, Qubilah, Ilyasah, Malikah, Malaak. And you all met Gamila. Come on in. Come on. Come on. All done, Mamma. All right, you two bring this out. But no serving until we finish making our coffee. Come on, Yoki, you take the plates. They're really getting along. I know. It's nice to see. So I heard you're planning to speak before Congress about Martin's holiday. Well, I have to do something. They keep shooting it down. And have ever since it was first introduced 18 years ago. They don't want to give it to a Black man. It's like Malcolm said, sitting at the table don't make you a diner, unless you eat some of what's on the plate, you know? Well, I hope he was wrong about that. What's wrong? I didn't upset, you did I? Oh, no, no. It's Qubilah. She's having nightmares again. I think of all my children, she was the one most affected by Malcolm's death. Well, have you talked with anyone about it? Maybe it's time you did. For both your sakes. I could give you the name of the doctor who met with my children. It may help. I don't think so. You know, after Martin died, I saw on TV how you led that march down in Memphis with your little ones at your side. You took them right into the city where he was shot dead. I was so amazed. But it's not a choice I would have made. It's something I had to do. There was no choice. I'm so proud of you, Qubilah. Princeton. Your daddy would have be proud too. He used to say education is our passport to the future. For tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today. You told me that so many times. I know. But I never get tired of quote your daddy. Now come on, let's... Mamma, wait. What's the matter? I want to go home. What are you talking about? We just got here. You can't go home now. Please? Baby, I know you're nervous. But everyone's nervous when they go away to college. You going to be fine. It's your time. Now you take your life in your hands and you run with it. OK? Now come on. Let's go see your dorm. Shoot, I'm more excited than you. Is this true? It can't come as a surprise to you, Cori. Hoover spied on presidents, senators, business leaders. And it did not stop there. Whatever dirty tricks that sick son of a bitch could think of, he'd do. He didn't care about your rights or mine. He spied on everyone from John Lennon to Albert Einstein. Hell, he even targeted the Kennedys. Martin and I always suspected they were taping our conversations. But I never knew they were bugging our home, our bedroom, even our children. I want these tapes suppressed. They never should have existed to begin with. But I... I think you should let... No. I will not let the evil forces of this country murder Martin again. Cori, I know you're upset. And believe me, I think you have every right to be. But are you sure this is the way you want to proceed? It's a sensitive time. President Carter is committed to pushing through your husband's holiday. If you go to work trying to suppress these tapes, people are going to wonder what it is you are trying to hide. I don't care. Well, then I'll set the paperwork and motion. I'm very sorry this had to happen. I'll give you a call later on this afternoon. Ralph? Have you heard them? Do you know what's on these tapes? I have. There are things on those tapes that should never come out. Personal things. Class, today, we are fortunate to have a very special surprise visitor. She's in town to testify to the UN before she flies to India to meet Indira Gandhi. So I think you may get a sense of the kind of person I'm talking about. I want you to extend a warm welcome to my dear friend, Coretta Scott King. Thank you so much. I'm always happy to lend my services to Betty's causes. Right now, all of you are her biggest calls, because you're the future. I know graduation is a few months from now. So I'm sure you're wondering what it's like out in the world. Doing good it seems like an abstraction when bills have to be paid and kids gotten off to school. But the impulse to help better the lives of your fellow man should never be ignored or set aside. The fact is, in helping others, we do help ourselves. That's why I fight to give women a voice, the poor opportunity and children a peaceful world. Their success, their empowerment vastly improves my world. We're all connected. Now, I didn't come here to preach. So I'd like to answer your questions, if I can. Did you always see yourself as an activist? Oh, heavens no. I wanted to be an opera singer. I was dead set on it. When I was your age, I was very much like all of you. Big plans. But God intervened. He introduced me to someone extraordinary. Martin taught me the value of self-sacrifice. Changed my life forever. Yes? Thank you. Thank you for coming, girl. I know you changed some lives in there today. Something they'll never forget. Oh, looking at those girls reminded me of when Martin and I were young. He was so charming and full of hope. Life was ahead of us. We had so many dreams. Oh, things aren't as clear as time passes. Dreaming wasn't the only thing Malcolm and I was doing back. Oh, busy as always. Traveling. The kids are well though. That's good. Betty, I have to ask you something. What is it? Was Malcolm faithful to you? Yes. Of course. He was a devout Muslim. Why are you asking? I've never talked to anyone about this before. A package came to the house. This was back in '64, just before Martin was supposed to go to Oslo to pick up the Nobel Peace Prize. It was addressed to him, but I always opened his mail. I'm sure they knew that. It was tapes. They were filthy, horrible. A letter came with them. Anonymous of course. The person who sent them... well, now I know it was the FBI... Threatened to expose Martin if he accepted the prize. I never confronted him. But Martin knew that I had heard the tapes. And he was crestfallen, mortified. But he was also brave. He threw the tapes in the garbage and when and accepted his Nobel Peace Prize. I supported that choice. I still do. Martin wasn't a saint. But that was a big omission and I loved him. And he loved you too. I'm sure. Qubilah? Mom, I'm in here. What are you doing home, honey? School's not on break for another week. I want to drop out. What? Why? Mamma, I don't fit in at Princeton. How can you say that? You're just as smart as anyone there. It's not about being smart. It's about the way they look at me as soon as they hear who I am. As if they expect me and boots in a beret. Ignore them. You don't have to worry about what people say. This is your life. I can't. I'm not strong like you. Understand, I love Daddy. But I don't want to be Malcolm X's daughter anymore. I just need to go somewhere I can be myself, whoever that is. But you can do that at Princeton, baby. No I can't. That's the point. Not in this country. I want to go to Paris. I've already looked at schools. I could start at the Sorbonne in January. But Princeton was your dream, Qubilah. No, it was your words. I have to find my own way now. Oh, God, baby, please. Give it another chance, please. I can't. Please, let me go. OK. OK. Thank you. Betty began to host a radio show in New York. I used to listen to it. I mean, I loved her. She was funny and sassy. And her message was always about empowerment, especially for women. No one understood that better than Coretta. On the anniversary of the march on Washington, she led the largest demonstration in the capital city had ever seen. She presented to Congress a petition with over six million signatures in support of the King holiday. And as always, there was opposition. This time, Jesse Helms led the charge. And Coretta had to take him on. Senator Helms has appointed to petition the federal judge to try to get the FBI tapes unsealed. Those tapes are illegal and an invasion of my family. Are you afraid of what might be revealed if they were to be released? No. And what about your husband's known communist connection? My husband had all sorts of friends from all walks of life. The sexual allegations, Mrs. King? How can you credit that trash? You know what he stood for. The FBI never should have made those tapes. My husband and my life is private. And so are the lives of everyone else that J. Edgar Hoover invaded. Was your marriage in trouble? Mom. Mom. You all right, Mamma? I'm fine, honey. Don't listen to what those people say. Your father loved me and I loved him. It never stops. They don't let it. If they can't win one way, they'll win another. I don't know. Maybe the country's just not ready. BETTY Listen, I couldn't even give my husband a stamp. And here you are trying to get yours whole national holiday. You're so right. So how's Qubilah? Is she back home from Paris now? Yeah, she came in last night with a baby and no father. I just keep thinking of how disappointed Malcolm would be, you know? I know how you feel. But she's back home now. That's the main thing. Yeah, I'm... I'm glad for that. She can stay with me and go back to school. It'd be a new beginning for her. Well, you know, listen, honey. I got to go. My show is about to start. Oh, I love listening to it whenever I'm in New York. BETTY Well, we're one of the few Black owned stations in the country. It's good we get to tell our side of the story. Oh, I... I... I got to go right now. I will call you later. You stay strong. Oh, I will. And you too. All right, bye bye. Welcome, New York. You're listening to a "Forum for Women." And I am your host, Dr. Shabazz. Oh, he is a beautiful boy. It's so good to have you back. It's good to be home. You know, I've been looking at some colleges for you. I was thinking you just thought of Medgar Evers and then transfer, if you wanted to. Sure, Mamma. Oh, baby. I know it's not easy. I raised you and your sisters alone. I think I'm going to bed. I thought we'd have some dinner. With the baby, I need to get sleep when I can. All right, you go to sleep. I'll look after Malcolm Jr. But later, we go over the course catalog. You're a mom now. You have responsibilities. I know. All kinds. Come on, baby. Come on, boy. Come to grandma. Come on grandma. Yes. Breaking news. In anticipation of the Senate vote on a holiday... Mamma, Mamma it's Coretta. Scott King arrived today in Washington. John Johnson joins us with the story. By a vote of 78 to 22, the Senate today created the 10th federal holiday and the first ever for a Black man, the Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday. The Bill now goes to the White House where President Reagan has indicated he will sign it. I'm humbled and I'm grateful. And I know my husband would have felt the same. This is a holiday for all of us to serve as a reminder to resolve our differences in a more respectful and peaceful manner. She did it. She did it. Oh, my God. She did it. She did it. She did it. She did it. She did it. In the early '90s Winnie he and Nelson Mandela visited Harlem. Oh, I remember that day. Betty was asked to make the introduction. And when Winnie realized who Betty was, she grabbed her and held her so tight. Both women wept in front of the crowd. I'll never forget how emotional that moment was. It was like a recognition of what Betty had done to so many. But Betty found it hardest to help the one young woman she cared about the most, Qubilah. Qubilah? Honey? I'm sorry. I must have the wrong apartment. Mrs. Shabazz. It's me, Mike. Oh, you don't remember me? It's, uh, Michael Fitzpatrick from 10th grade. Oh, yes. Of course. Yeah, yeah. Qubilah didn't tell me she was living with anyone. Uh, no. No, I'm, uh, just crashing there a couple of days. Where is she? Hey, Mamma Betty. Hey, baby. How are you doing? I brought you something. Thank you. BETTY Where's your mama? I don't know. Baby, you want to come visit with grandma for a little? Come on. We can have fun together. I want to stay with mamma. Hey, baby, look who showed up. Put your shirt on. Yeah, OK. No problem. Hey, Mamma. Hey, baby. You want a drink? You know I don't drink. What makes you think I was offering alcohol? Nothing. Nothing, honey. I'm sorry, Mamma. I'm happy to see you. Hey, isn't it good to see Mamma Betty? Going into the other room so we can talk a minute. What are you doing here? Why didn't you call? I tried. I wanted to let you know I sold the place in Mount Vernon and I'm moving into a condo in Yonkers. I was thinking Malcolm Jr. Could stay with me for a while. There's plenty of room. Why? Do you think I can't take care of him? I know you can. You're his mamma. It's just, you're in between jobs. No, I'm working at a check cashing place. Why are you looking at me like that? Not good enough for your Princeton educated daughter? Still so proud of me. You know I am. Honey, you're a warm, sensitive soul. I love... I wished you'd stop saying. It's true, baby. I know. That's a problem. This model. That's my type. Oh, girl, look at these. Oh, I couldn't wear those. Why? Too flashy? I'd wind up on the floor. No you won't. Come on. They sexy. You afraid the men may take notice? Let's see. Must be somebody... oh. He is fine. You think he's fine, you wear them. I won't, girl, please. I can't wear those. Why not? I won't be able to dance in them. You hungry? Mm-hmm. Oh, I got you a new something. It's a cosmetics big. It's 'cause you always carrying that plastic sack with your lipsticks in it. Now, you know I couldn't be seen would you like that anymore. I love it. But, girlfriend, you may as well give up now. I'll never be able to accessorize as well as you. And their hair is always perfect. Well, it's all about the rollers. Poor little Malcolm. Qubilah's been taking them all around the country. She just can't seem to settle down anywhere. She's been drinking too. Oh. Every time I go see her, she says, don't worry. I'm doing fine. It's like I can't reach her anymore. And I wonder sometimes, where that little girl I used to know has disappeared to. Oh, she's still in there. It hasn't been easy for any of our children. It's not something they had a hand in. But they have paid the price. I know. I know. When Malcolm was killed, he left a path of destruction I feel like I just can't ever fix. It makes me so angry, Cori. Live from New York City, Gabe Pressman's "Channel" "4 News Forum" with your host Gabe Pressman. Today's guest, Dr. Betty Shabazz, widow of the controversial civil rights figure Malcolm X. Betty, it's good to see you. And thank you for coming in to speak with me. It's my pleasure, Gabe. You were one of the people who were kind to my husband. You know, I first met him on a street corner in Harlem. I saw his brilliance even then. He was changing at the end of his life, wasn't he? Yes, he was. That's why it makes me so sad that he didn't have time to communicate those changes to the people that couldn't get the early image of him out of their minds. Which brings us to the reason for our interview. No doubt, you've heard of the upcoming film "Brother" Minister." It hasn't been released, but I'd like to show you a clip I managed to obtain, if that's all right? Yeah. I love the Elijah Muhammad enough that if you attacked him, I'll kill you. Love casts out fear. We don't give a damn about no White man law when you attack what we love. What do you got to say about it? Did you teach Malcolm? Did you clean up Malcolm? Was he your traitor or was he ours? And if we dealt with him the way a nation deals with a traitor, then what the hell business is that of yours? Betty, do you believe that Farrakhan had anything to do with the slaying of your husband? Of course, yes. Yes. I mean, it was a matter of... It was a badge of honor. I mean, nobody kept it a secret. Everybody talked about it. Malcolm X is back in the news after his widow Betty Shabazz named Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan as the man responsible for her husband's assassination 30 years ago in the Audubon Ballroom in Harlem. Now minister Farrakhan is fighting back. Today, he filed a $2.4 billion lawsuit against the "New York Post" for libel after it repeated the allegations. Hello. Mrs. Betty Shabazz? Yes. Will you accept a collect call from Qubilah Shabazz? Yes, of course. Mamma. Honey, where are you? They said they was going to kill them? Kill who? Farrakhan. But I swear I didn't do it, Mamma. I didn't do it. Honey, where are you? Where are you? Mamma. Oh, baby. Are you OK? Just get me out of here, Mamma. I will. I will. Oh, what happened? Sit. What's going on? I saw what you said on TV and how Farrakhan reacted. I talked to Michael about taking him out to protect you, to keep you safe. I got scared, Mamma. I didn't mean for him to do it. I said no right away. You believe me, don't you? Of course, I do. They took Malcolm Jr. Oh, no, no. Baby, don't... it's OK. He's with me. Don't you worry, baby. I'm going to do whatever it takes to get you out of here. You hear me? You know me. I love you, Qubilah. I love you too, Mamma. I know, baby. Now you be strong. It's going to be all right. Listen to me. I... I need you to understand... Michael. Michael. How could I not want you to. Right, well, understand because this is something I want to make sure isn't just idle chat. Michael, I have a lot at stake. I lost my father and I'm at risk of losing my mother. Understand? Do you understand? Yeah. Where'd they get it? Michael Fitzpatrick. It turns out he was working on the FBI payroll. Oh, my God. She... she didn't mean what she says. She was set up. We need to mount an aggressive defense. Stress Qubilah's substance abuse problem. She doesn't have anything like that. Betty, this is no time to be proud. She's facing a sentence of up to 90 years. You want to save her, don't you? Yes. Of course. One thing working in our favor is the tremendous outpouring of support we're getting from our community. Farrakhan's people have reached out. He's offering to host a fundraising effort for Qubilah. Why would he do that? To dispute he had anything to do with Malcolm's death. And show a united front with your family. You'd have to be there. So you're asking me to let Farrakhan off the hook to save Qubilah. The DA will never prosecute if Farrakhan says she's innocent. The forecast, mostly sunny skies today with briskly... winds. Expect a high of 52 degrees. All right. Ooh! Come in! Oh. Oh, my God. It's so good to see you. And you. How you doing? I'm better now. Come on in. Come on. And then she walks in, Qubilah. She looks so lost and vulnerable. But then all of a sudden, it was like I could see her again. My little girl. All my life have been trying to protect my kids. And now she's in prison because I couldn't keep my mouth shut. All these years, I didn't want to talk about Malcolm's death because it... It made it real. And now when you finally do, they ask you to forgive the man that you believe killed your husband to save your little girl. Cori, I don't know if I can do it. Oh, Betty. Sometimes, to protect the ones we love, we have to do the thing that's hardest. Coretta was right. Betty stood up in the Apollo Theater beside Farrakhan. I was there. She spoke so powerfully. Her speech was broadcast into churches and mosques across the nation. And after that, charges against Qubilah were dropped. But Qubilah's personal struggles continued. Malcolm Jr. went to live with Betty. It was tough for him. You know, like any kid, he just wanted to be with his mother. Here you go, honey. Don't do that, please. Well, aren't you going to eat? I'm not hungry. You got to eat something. Look, maybe after dinner, I'll take you bowling or something, OK? What would you like to do? I want to go home to Mamma. Sweetie, your mamma can't take you right now. You know that. Why? Because you say so. Because she's getting things together. Look, I know it's not easy, but please, try and understand. I want to go back. Well, you can't. Why? Because you can't. I wish you could, but you can't. Now that's just the way it is. Now eat your food. Oh, my... Malcolm. Malcolm. Hey, what are you doing? Don't stand there. You OK, kid? Are you OK? I... I saw someone putting her on a stretcher. Saw who? My... my grandma. Grandma? She... she must have walked down the hall coming to look for me. I didn't think she was going to do that. Come with me, kid. Are you going to send me home now? It's going to be OK. I didn't mean for a Mamma Betty to get hurt. We're going to look into that, all right? I'm sorry. Auntie Coretta. I don't want Mamma to go. Oh, baby. It's my fault. Oh, no, no. No, no, child. No, no. Talk to her. She wants to see you. Tell her I'm sorry. She knows you are. She understands everything. I pray you're right. Oh, God. What have they done to you? Oh, baby. Can you hear me? Oh, Betty. It wasn't... it wasn't the boy's fault. Tell him. I will. I just wish I had a little longer. You have time. Plenty of time. Hey, do you remember that time that we went to the spa and you wanted me to swim? I didn't want to be seen in a bathing suit so got them to close the pool. And I asked you how you did it. And you said, girlfriend, I've been an activist all my life. You think I can get them to close a pool for one hour? Oh, we laughed so hard at that. You teased me about my figure. Said the men didn't know what they were missing. And I told you that you was the one that was the real catch. That was true. You were. Well, I've been thinking about that time a lot lately. And I want to do it again. So I'm going to look into it just as soon as you feeling better. But right now, you need to rest and get well and take care of yourself. Because I don't want you getting all worn out so that you won't be able to go. You just let us take care of you for a while. OK? Betty, hung on for 23 days before mercifully she passed. I saw her there. I... I... I wasn't the only on. Hundreds more came to visit. Educators, celebrities, theologians, politicians, friends. So many friends. So many. Coretta died nine years later of ovarian cancer. Betty and Coretta, they embodied a spirit of service and a dedication to the memories of their husbands so that their struggles wouldn't die with them. They faced tragedy, but they refused to let tragedy defeat them. Instead, they fought on for their children and for the future, for all of us. Betty and Coretta, not such opposites after all. No.
