MERCENARY Well? They just want the youngest, the tallest, the biggest. He's not heavy enough. But he's good. If it's not him, it'll be somebody else. Makes no difference. I'm running out of time. What's your name? Soane Tokelau. How old are you? I'm 19. What's the matter? Don't you want to leave? It's not that. Are you sure? It's my father. I'll handle your father. Scram, Elvis. My cousin was supposed to go. But the moron got himself arrested. Drunk driving. Elvis! Shut up! So your son will go in his place. The plane leaves in 5 days. To us. To us. Why does he deserve this? He's a little jerk-off. I'll take care of him, keep him in line. He'll be in good hands. I know what's in store for him there. I've been myself. Nothing good there. He'll be well paid. He'll send money home. For you and your family. Look where you live. You could move somewhere nicer. I lead a good life here. I have everything I need. And you, what do you need? What do you want in exchange for my son? I take 10% of his salary. A cattle trader, eh? Soane? Walk your friend to his car. Leone, this opportunity won't come again. There are other players. Show your friend out before I get mad. I'm leaving. What did you say? I'm leaving... whether you like it or not. It makes no difference. You little shit! You'll see! You think you're a man? You think you're a man? Say it, you little shit! You still want to go? Yes! What? You little bastard. I'll kill you, you hear me? You're gonna die tonight. Where are you gonna go? You're worthless. Now what do you have to say? Well? Get out of here! Go to your room! Now! Take me with you. I can't. Don't leave me alone with him. Morning, Granny. Morning, Soane. We'll have a going-away party and a farewell ceremony. Soane. Do you know my cousin Sosefo? Call him if you have a problem in France. Friends... Today, our whole community is losing a child, and I... am losing a son. It's with a heavy heart that I bid him farewell. I've tried... to teach him about life. But he no longer accepts my authority as a father. All of you present here are witnesses to our last meal together. Thank you. There will be less love On your island, my King For I'm leaving for active duty To hold our flag high And make it stronger Father, mother It doesn't matter to me If I live or if I die Whether I stay behind or leave for combat I'll die one day or another Sorry. Here. It's a gift for your journey. Have faith in this book. Wherever you go, the Virgin Mary will watch over you, and keep you safe and sound. Leave and learn to listen to those who take care of you. Always believe in Mary in your prayers. She'll watch over you always. Everywhere. Remember. That's all I ask. Leave and learn to listen. Come drink with me. I'm not allowed to. Who cares? Here. Tastes like piss. Drink like a man. Fucker. Tomasi! Tomasi! Get in the house. Hurry up! Since when do you drink? Party's over. Get out of my house. Where can I go at this time of night? You're a free man now. Figure it out. Let me get my things. Everything here belongs to me. To me... and my family. Once... these clothes belonged to my son. They're all... that remains of him. For my son... is dead. Take me with you, please. Don't be stupid. Are you Abraham's guy? Yes. Where's your luggage? I don't have any. How much do you weigh? 120 kilos. Abraham? Your 140-kilo prop must've lost 20 in the plane, what do I do with him? You'll pay me back for his return ticket, or else. He leaves in 4 hours. I'm tired of your bullshit. Thanks. Here, kid. I'm sorry. Safe trip home. You moron! What the hell were you thinking? You trying to make me look like a fool? Why didn't you insist? I'm warning you, sending you there was expensive! Go back to Noumea and find a way to pay me back! Stop crying, you little shit! Are you still hungry? Yes. Thanks. What do you think? I can snap my fingers and get you a contract? Why didn't you go home? My father would kill me. Malia, bedtime. Goodnight. Goodnight. Who brought you over? A guy named Abraham. You sleep here tonight, tomorrow take your stuff and go. I don't want trouble with Abraham. Go take a shower. You smell like a hoghouse. Hey guys. Tell me... Sosefo, our Wallisian prop, brought me a young man from his country, who wants to play, but our season has started, our team is full. Is it true you need a prop? He's not what you'd call a beast, but he's pretty solid, about 1.85 meters tall, for about 110 or 115 kilos. So if you want Sosefo can introduce you. What a crappy car! What're you laughing at? Focus on not fucking up. Thanks for everything. Don't thank me. Show them what you've got, OK? First line! Squat! Second line! - Crouch! - Stabilize. Touch. Pause! Engage! Fu-mel! Stabilize! Again. Let's go! Let's see some effort! Your kid's not bad. Is he your cousin, your nephew? I found him on my doorstep. Is he serious at least? Look, try him out. If he's good, sell him. Say you trained him, take a cut and everyone's happy. How about a haka? Hey guys, he won't do the haka! Haka! Haka! Hey, a little haka! C'mon Maori, don't be a dick. Come back. He doesn't want to. Let him be. 111 kilos. Take a seat. We'll put you on a weight gain plan with the physical trainer. What are these marks? Rugby fights. Have you been playing long? Since I was a kid. You can get dressed. Take this twice a day for your little boo-boos. This is yours, too. For me you're good to go. Your turn. Sign here. You get 400 euros a month. How much is that? Wanna go back to your father? Sign. If it's not enough, we'll find a solution. A part-time job with a team sponsor. See Ren√©, there? He has bungalows. He'll get you set up. Sign! Good. A little welcome present. Thanks. To your new life. You OK, son? Come on. Was it the two beers? No, it's not the beer. Did doc give you magic candy? Those were horse pills he gave you. I'll show you the place. C'mon Soane, 2 more minutes! Go on, hit hard! Again, again! Faster! Keep going! Don't stop, it's getting hard. C'mon, harder! Don't stop! Harder! Keep it coming! Only 5 more seconds! Don't give up now. OK, breathe. Good work. Here, Soane. Here. No. 2, the Saffer. Destroy him. OK? Don't let him finish the game. For Fumel, 3 is off, Jaadi. 18 is coming on, Tokelau. Go on, Soane. Show no mercy! Give it all you got! Crouch! Touch! Pause! Engage! Motherfucker! Quick, a stretcher! Mind taking a picture with the kid? No. Don't be afraid, Louis. He's just a big teddy bear. The boss said you're looking for work? I own a nightclub, "The Golgotha." Ever done security? No. Piece of cake. Three nights a week, 600 a month. Sound good? Yeah, OK. I'm Gonzalez. Come by this week. That works. Cheers. Screw this team. How are we supposed to win in such shitty conditions? Then why do you stay? I'm 35 and I've got... my daughter and wife in Georgia. I have to feed them. Are you married? Got a family? No. You shouldn't get married in this line of work. It's too hard. We're goddamn mercenaries. But drinking... That we can do, Angelo. Vodka! Dance with the pretty girl. Get off your ass. C'mon, I don't bite. Sorry. Are you OK? It's nothing. I'm OK. Lemme see. Are you an All Black? No, I'm Wallisian. What's your name again? Soane. You speak good French for an islander. I am French. Wallis is part of France. Most guys would be crying for mommy. I'm hammered. I don't feel a thing. Sure I'm not hurting you? No, it's fine. I'm not used to being taken care of. But you have lots of boyfriends. They're not boyfriends. I'm just the fatty everyone fucks. You're not fat, you're beautiful. Agen! Agen! Bless this day May the water flow And the fish bite May the world blossom May all of us here stay true to God forever. So how's it coming? It's a shitty team. I do their dirty work. They treat me like a maid. Any news from Abraham? Fuck that asshole. He left me at the airport. Let him come. I'm waiting. He thinks I'm scared? Who do you think you are? You're in France thanks to him! Without him, you'd be back with your hogs! You can hide all you want, Abraham will find you. Look at you. You stick out like a sore thumb. Daddy, I'm hungry. We're coming, Malia. Go to your room. God is love. He's anger and retribution, too. Don't be a smartass, Soane. If Abraham gives the word, they'll torch your father's house. That doesn't scare me. My father can stand up for himself. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... On your backs for crunches. So Maori, did you fuck her? - Who? - The fatty. Did you go cannibal on her ass like they do in your country? We've all fucked Coralie. Up the ass, too. All eskimo brothers here. Cut it out, Joachim. It's getting obnoxious. Right here. Yeah, good. You're her type. - She likes it rough. - Fuck off! Don't you people share? So the white girl's yours? You're in Fumel now, asshole! What's going on over there? Break it up! Get off me! - Son of a bitch! - Stop, Soane, enough! We're a family here. Why did you sign? We're a family here at Fumel. Look at me when I'm talking. Are you a brainless piece of meat? You hit your brother. You hit your brother. He's family. You have siblings? Do you hit them? Are you a savage or what? You should be ashamed. Both of you guys, one week to make it right. And the match, give it 200%. Get out! Evening. Thank you. Have a nice day. Hey. Hey. You work here? It's a small town, you know. You mean a shithole. A bag too, please. Was it me you fought over? Forget it. It's not your fault. Wait for me? I'm off in 10 minutes. Sounds good. Did it hurt? - What? - This. No, it stung a little. What does it mean? It's the story of my family. Maybe someday you'll add me to it. I'd erase it if I could. You don't know my family. What's wrong? Are you taking magic candy, too? I want a great game today. We're on our turf today. Let's do whatever it takes! What do you want from me? You won't get away this time! Get off me, faggot. Abraham says hi. Way to go! That was awesome! The squad is here, guys! - What the hell's that? - Drop 'em. The magic candies, remember? Drop your shorts, quick! My dick's not white! It's the only one I have. Just squeeze. Oldest trick in the book. Come on, we've come this far. Angelo! Angelo! Angelo, I love you! Hey, guys. Guys, please. Let him speak. Guys, it's important. Soon I'll be rich. And I'll invite you all to my wedding with Coralie. I love you. I want us to make lots of babies. I promise to work hard every day to feed her. Our kids will be fat and chubby. That's why I ask you for your daughter's hand. Granted! Coralie? Will you take me as husband, and father of your children? Dork. Raise your glass to his health! Raise your glass... Raise your glass... to his health! He made a great speech! Soane, come on over. Come here, big guy. Look at this champ. You're our savior today. This one's on the house. Go have fun. Here. To you. To our victory. Let's get wasted! Elvis! Your baby is doing just fine. Would you like to know the sex? It's not bad luck back home? No. It's a girl. Know what we could do? Buy a house there, on the beach under the coconut trees, with our little daughter. And live naked all day, huh? What's wrong? I'm not sure it was you. What? The baby might not be yours. Who cares? It'll show if she's blond. I said I don't care. Goddamn salary's 3 weeks late! - Did you get paid? - No. With no warning? They say later. They don't give a shit. What's his deal? You haven't heard? He crashed his mom's car in a parking lot. That's messed-up. What a moron. Your attention, please. Quiet down. Guys? I have some bad news. I just got back from Marcoussis. The finance board gave us a red card. Some guys already know, they've been managing for a few weeks. I've decided... unfortunately... to stop paying your salaries. No pay? No pay at all? Listen up. Listen up. It's the only solution. Otherwise there's no club. You went to Marcoussis for that? Look, we set the bar high and now... our sponsors have lost faith. We're pathetic. We suck! Easy for you to blame the players. All season we're in the mud. You're in a cozy office balancing the budget. Apparently you failed. I signed a pro contract. What will I live on? Don't get excited. I have no choice. So wait a few weeks... We've already waited 3 weeks! Your promises are bullshit! And me? What about you? You're not pro. You have a job. Deal with it. I'm striking. Fuck this shit. Divided we fall, guys. If they split, where does that leave us? So you're gonna be a dad? Yeah. A lot of responsibility. Don't go commie on us. Excuse me? I heard talk of a strike. You foreigners aren't gonna picket, are you? I'm part of the team too. Don't catch a cold, son. - Soane! - Go inside. - What's wrong with you? - Go inside. What, you jealous of your cousins? They're not my cousins. Stay here. I'll just be a minute. What do you want? Well, well... you have a way with women. Right, Stanley? I figured you were living under a bridge. When actually, you have a house, and a pretty girl. Beautiful, in fact. Know what? Your brother in Noumea pays dearly because of you. And your father stands guard with his shotgun. He keeps your brother under lock and key, so he won't disappear like you. Poor kid. He thinks you're a big star, when actually, you're a measly bouncer... who lives in a shack worse than his. Is it money you want? - Who are those guys? - Wait here. That's all I have. Are you fucking kidding? How much is your whore? Leave her out of this. You pay a slut, and give me nothing? - Is he talking about me? - Run! On your knees! Run! - Where are you going? - Leave her! Motherfucker! Don't move! Hick! Daddy didn't give you enough? Hold still! Let me at him. You little jerk! Watch us teach him a lesson. Hick! I spent a fortune so you could fuck your whore. How dare you? You dog! Don't move. You think you're stronger than me? Stay calm. Pay attention. You think you're stronger than me? Listen. Listen good. You have one month. One month, you hear? One month to pay me back. If you sign a contract, you do it with me. Understood, you dog? Understood? Yes! Do as he asks... and it will be fine. I'll kill that motherfucker. And go to prison? What will your father say? That he told you so? That he always knew where you'd end up? My club is looking for my replacement. Someone like me. I'm not like you. That's true. You're better than I am. Look at me. I'm broken. I can barely walk. 10 years from now, you'll understand. Will you go back to Noumea? What for? I'm not the man I was. There's no going back. She's doing fine. And the baby? The baby's a fighter. But she'll have to stay calm from now on. That means bedrest, and no activity at all. Get some rest too for the game this weekend. How much do you need? It's not your problem. I'll find a solution. It won't ever stop. Coralie, lie down. Coralie! - They could've killed my baby. - It's mine too! It's not and you know it. Where are you going? Coralie? - Where are you going? - Are you gonna to hit me too? The kick-off is ours. We have to show them this is our turf! This is war. Let's walk all over them today. The club's survival depends on it. Look at yourselves. Today we're at war. We've never lost to these guys, and today's no different. Today's no different. Stay on the offensive! Hits and tackles... We keep going after every hit! Together! We're not losing our standing tonight! We're a family. This family is going to survive with a win. Fu-mel! Crouch. Touch. Pause. Engage! Medic! Are you OK? What's wrong with him? He's not himself. Pick yourself up! It's up to you now, Soane! Hang in there! Replace him. Pull him out. - You can't let him continue. - What? There's nobody else. The Georgian's on strike. He binds the scrum. If he's out, what then? By the wind of the South Seas! By the Tokelau Islands! My people! My people! Prepare for battle! Raise your fist and shout: Pacific Islands! Rise up! Stand tall! And tell me who's strongest! In heaven and on earth! I'll fight! Fight to the death! In this world and the next, I'll fight to the death! Rise up, strong man! Let's do this! Hold the line! Stay low! Fall back! The boss can't wait to sell you. He's sure to make a pretty penny. It'll put the club back on its feet. You look overjoyed. Where's Abraham? He's in Lourdes. Did that bastard go there to repent? He's finishing his tattoo. Screw his tattoo. Want me to come along? I don't need you. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen! What are you doing here? I was drunk. I'm crazy about that bitch. Call her that again and I cut your balls off! Fuck! Stop! Whatcha gonna do about it? Whatcha gonna do? Get your mother's car? Give me 5,000 euros to keep my mouth shut. - Understand? - Stop! Stop! Son of a bitch! There's a guy in the bathroom. Where are you going? Come back! Soane? In my office, now. Right now. He tried to run me over! I don't give a shit. Without proof or a witness, you're stuck. Soane? Wait. I couldn't care less. No transfer, no fee. Are you blackmailing me? And your magic pills, I can send them to the Federation. 5,000 now and the rest when we sign. That's final. Are you crazy? We're drowning in debt. Don't be greedy! I don't give a fuck! It's that or the club goes under. You're one fucked-up mercenary. Signed. Your turn. Welcome to SUA. Who are those guys? Here, your money. How'd you get it so quick? None of your business. Stop acting tough. I've been getting offers for you. A great future awaits you. You don't get it. I'm free now. Free? You'll never be free. Believe me. You can't change that. Oh yeah? Don't move! Don't move! I'm free! Understand? I'm free to kill you if I want to. Say it! Say it! Say I'm free! Say it! If you touch my brother, or my father, or if I ever hear from you again, I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you like a pig! Understand? Understand? Call a doctor. Leave with me. I can't. - Please. - I can't! I'm gonna get fired. Go away. Take good care of blondie. Father! It's me! Your lost son! I beg you... for your forgiveness. Grant it to me, so I can live again. Go away! You're dead. Go back where you came from. Deliver me from death, Leone! Say the word, and everything can be forgiven. Go away! Demon! Get off my land! As you wish, Dad. But I'm taking him with me. I've already lost one son, I won't let you take the other. Don't make me do it! Stop it, Father! Stop it, I said! Look at yourself, Dad. Look what you've sown. Must I strike you to make you understand? Do I have to kill you to make you love me? You're not the one I hate. It's myself. I brought you into this world only to see you dishonor me. Go, both of you! Go away! A feeling of sorrow hangs over the King's palace It is the Gods who are saddened I wouldn't want to offend you But let me tell you this tale Singing this song will help you remember the life of the late Leone Tokelau It's a tale to be learned and passed on I told you to let me be. I came to offer my condolences. Take your gift and clear out. This gift marks our truce. My anger and your sins will be cleansed by your father's death. Now you know the price of your freedom. Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Leone! Look at me! By the wind of the South Seas! By the Tokelau Islands! My people, listen to me! Here is the offering! Here is the offering! Shout it! Heave-ho! We pull to row the boat! Heave-ho! We pull to row the boat! To open our eyes! To rise up! We must all rise up together! So high! Rise up, strong man! Rise up, strong man! Subtitles: David H. Pickering
