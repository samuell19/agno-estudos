When was it? -last year same time you started fucking up in school? -bravo Mr Freud took Marc to Vietnam, so he could forget, then he caught that shit, galloping hepatitis ..2 months later... laurent told you? his folks think he died of AIDS you knew he was queer? -you bet, we were like brothers,only 2 years apart.He knew when he was 15 and i did at around 18, i think. -marc took it badly,2 gay cousins, he didn't find it funny at all. he felt guilty,feeling everyone would think it was his fault, like it was contagious. -same shit we usually hear, no?, showing he knew the limits of his family too well. i don't give a shit what people think,they can all stare at me, i don't give a fuck.If you wanna kiss me in front of everybody here, go ahead. even in front of your dad's accountant?you won't manage to hide all your life you know. i know they'll find out one day,but i want them to know you first and see that you're a great guy. -that we can be gay without wearing high heels and if emma had rejected you when you told her,you'd have agreed not to see her anymore perhaps? - i didn't give her a choice if i blurt out i'm gay to my folks, odds are i'll lose them and i hate the idea. before dad's accident, i hadn't realized i loved them so much. there. for gardeners' hands. -thanks, but i'm not a gardener, neither is he. sorry, but i haven't really figured what your nursery guy does? - applied research pierre, same thing laurent wants to do,so hard to understand for a pharmacist? in fact,they're biologists and all , and they try figuring how plants could resist pollutants. -at one end man destroys nature,and at the other he tries saving it.Good thing there are guys like him. i don't know your nurseryman,but looking at his dad's business, it shows he's a good guy. At least, he got you to adopt a profession. he really is a great guy. In fact, it would be cool if you'd met him, well, if you feel like it. easy, just invite him over for a weekend. -no no, forget it,anyway he works saturdays. so what. we'll expect him on saturday night, he can even stay over and leave on sunday. sure, he could come for Marine's birthday, a new face in the family, it'll be easier to endure the others. you see, when we don't know,i was far from knowing, -we have to go through that to be an engineer and digging earth with your hands doesn't hurt you. even gardeners picking leaves in parks, they contribute to nature's balance. -to nature's disbalance must be a big workload,your nursery, your research, -laurent told us for your father. yes, very noble of you, especially for someone your age. -when someone you love goes away, we try to keep a bit more than memories. c'mon, blow... yay, still one left super, good girl i want daddy to cut the slices. - hold on marine, you'll get some..oh lala. -take the candles off first..the candles. (-sorry, but how old were you when your dad died?) everything ok darling? -yeah (- and what did he die of?) from heart attack -aaah, sorry and pardon for asking, but your mother? she never remarried if that's what you're wondering. -and you? are you married? yes,i married Science! not my nephew's case it seems, right Carole? -well, when you have the chance to meet the man of your life, you don't want to messup. So, i'm getting sleepy,if you'll excuse me? of course dear -anyway, we're off too laurent,you're coming? i think i'll ... - ah no no cedric, we want you to stay till tomorrow.I had the guestroom ready for you. You'll see, one sleeps marvelously well here. go up!...nite everybody! -i've put out the summer linen -yes, thank you Jeanne can you tell me what the heck i'm doing here?How long is this joke gonna last?..I came over with cedric to help you laurent,not to be your alibi. anyway, it's the last time. I'm not coming back ever if you don't do anything. - dammit, i can't, i can't! then go explain that to Cedric.good night. Carole refuses to carry on? It's normal now that i took her place. -you've never taken her place, stop, your parents.. -who cares, they're asleep you scared? no... but i don't want to, not here,not like this, not as long as they won't know what i mean for you. i couldn't today with Marine, the others,..next time!? -for sure, and yo know, next time,you'll find another excuse. it's like the first time.. the more you wait, the harder it gets..like losing your virginity. what? you'd rather i speak to them? -you mad or what? listen laurent, little fondling games under the table or between doors don't do it for me. what would they think if they'd find us? "yet more fucking fags doing their dirty stuff behind their backs",is that it? i'm over with feeling shame now. I'm not ashamed to be with you. sorry, but i can't sleep here. -whatever, just take off,i didn't ask you to stay over, my mom did. don't force me to cheat,don't,i can't do it. in any case, my mission is a success, my in laws find me extraordinary... you'll excuse me to your parents. what you doing here? -working i can see that.. but weren't you at Laurent's? -yep, except i'm here now something happened? ...isn't it early for whiskey no? tis always too early for anything.. ...Fuck!! don't ask laurent to go faster than you do. hello? ah, it's you, no no... he just got in..no.. mister is sulking! hold, i'll check. it's for you ah, it's not ready, you'll have to wait -i'm not eating with you, i'm off to Paris. now? -err, yeah. A conference starting tomorrow, i ought to be there. and you'll be back when? -bah, when it's over? sorry to leave you on your own. i'm not alone, laurent's there. ..what about the lab? -don't worry, i'll call you damn, it's not going to start allover. Are you Mrs Mauries?Laurent's mom? -yes! I'm Cedric's mother, Cedric Martin. Your son is training with us. i would like to talk to you both we were so sorry cedric couldn't stay the weekend. laurent told us you'd been ill? -ah yes, but i'm fine now. there's a problem with laurent? about the training? yes and no. - i don't understand it's somewhat touchy, i ... i don't know if i'm doing the right thing here. -you just go ahead, we're willing to hear everything. well, yes, there is a problem but it's between cedric and laurent in fact, i mean... i believe our sons love each other. what do you mean? -what you've just heard. what are you talking about?.. it's impossible you're mistaken.Laurent has a girlfriend. -yes i know,i know Carole,but laurent loves cedric. i take it you're telling us the truth? -yes Mr Mauries, i'm uncapable of lying. I know it's very hard,but if i'm here, it's because they need us. I'll see you out. you think hiding in your bedroom will solve anything? -i'm not looking for solutions right now. i'm not the one who left you laulau why don't you call him? -to say what? bah you're right after all, you can go and ask Dad for my hand -why not.For once that you're in love. you're fucking up everything there it's not my fault, i didn't ask to be gay.I've given enough already i think. my poor laulau..what is your life going to be? Watchout SnowWhite! perhaps Prince Charming is coming to pick you up. Laurent is there? -yes, he's in the bedroom Laurent? It's your dad! what brings you here? -wait dad,, what's wrong? you disgust me. You really got a kick out of this hey? No need to come home ever. Laurent! Laurent! what you doing? Stop! - that assfucker! i'm gonna smash his little face. Stop! Calm down!have you gone mad? -calm down? you crazy? you know what he did? He told my parents everything that bastard. it's not him, it's me he knows nothing. I told them. are you nuts? what the fuck did you do that for? -but because i thought.. - and my mom!?.. fuck,have you thought of my mom ? Jeanne, you want to end up like me?Swallowing up your whole pharmacy? -Martine, please i can't go on living like this.It's as if we'd killed our own son. Martine, it's not your fault. We can't accept everything,even if it's our own kids. what have we done to make them like that? we've always let him do all he wanted. Jeanne,there's one question we must ask, one only "Do we love our kids as much as we pretend?" they must have got a kick out of listening to me talk about my grandchildren. What an idiot...idiot! that!.. they could have spared up that masquerade. -it's our fault.We've pushed him to lie, to do what pleased us. what shame!what will we look like if people find out! -don't worry about people.We don't live with them but with our kids. When your son will be gone,it's not them who'll replace him. you pour me another one please? -might be a bit too much no? -i'm legal, i pay you, so, you serve. no one is like anyone else.It means nothing. i've got to manage fucking a girl, fuck. -i'm not a girl one manages to fuck you really don't get it. -you think?You're a fag laurent, so accept yourself and quit annoying us with your issues. sorry to tell you, but marc had more courage. good evening carole, i know it's late but i must talk to laurent, is he in? Ah, Emma! i fear you won't be able to drink Pastis for a long while. A whole bottle on an empty stomach. i'll just give you something to relax you..and get some rest! if you feel he's too depressed, double the dosage -i shall, thank you Doctor. goodbye -goodbye you see, even at my age one can mess up. what the fuck am i doing here? -this way i can watch over you And stirring shit around you is a habit of yours? it's more this mess which i can't bear i've got fuck all to do here -you can leave, whenever you want you do as you wish ...ok, i'm hungry you don't ask me any questions? -to know what? well, how your parents reacted -don't giv a fuck OK!i was wrong to do what i did, ok although... you've got to give them time laurent you're unbearable, you , Cedric and the others like you. we have to take it in,no time to understand, no time to cry either... -yeah, but you, you didn't kick cedric out, you still love him. because you think your parents don't love you? - for sure, they just find me disgusting. why don't you try talking to your mom the way you're talking to me?Why don't you tell her what happened with Carole last night? why do i now all this and she doesn't? -after all, i think i'd have liked to have a mom like you. Ah well,he's going to have a piece of my mind that one.. 2 days without any news Cedric!...oh,good morning,can you hold the line for a moment please? (it's your mom, do you want to talk to her?) ...sorry, a customer.. ..yes, but laurent, he's out right now. yes, he's here for a few days. ...Pardon? ... If you wish, certainly...where? i'm so lost. For me it's unbearable to think laurent is a ...it's also unbearable to think i won't see him ever again. it's also unbearable for him not to see you again. Jeanne, how can one kick his child out simply because he's a bit different? how could you ever accept that? -i weeped too. I too saw myself as a nice granny, surrounded with grandchildren. and that a boy should sleep with another, even today.. you see? you think as we do. We have nothing against those people. You know, several come to the drugstore. -yes, but they're called neither Laurent, nor Marc. and when it hits us, we're all the same. i accepted because i didn't want to lose my son. And whetever i think deep down, i want him to be happy...not you? Jeanne,Cedric and Laurent have split up. -it does not interest me. Cedric wanted laurent to tell you everything, but laurent refused, he didn't want to hurt you, to lose you. he did all he could to lose us. -listen Jeanne,i don't know what you expect of me. All i know is that Laurent is very unhappy, he's suffering for the hurt he's caused you. because he'd rather not be homosexual. and because he loves my son in spite of everything. i have to go back to the nursery. it's not like you to have done this. -you think it's like me to swallow down a whole bottle of Pastis? and then try to fuck my best friend? honestly, i don't know how you manage to not hate me. -ah, you know, i like you as you are. i even think i couldn't like you if you were any different. But that i found out a bit late. what will you do till school starts? you're going to stay here? no no, i'm leaving.Think it's for the best. This way you can keep the apartment you only have to find someone -ah, but i do have someone. Mathieu! aw, you and your cigarettes. -sorry, i'll put it out. no,smoke it you silly,if not you'll tell me you have to go water the garden. that's what Cedric does? you love him hey? i'm not staying Emma. I don't really care to be here when Cedric returns. I'll finish my job in the lab and then i'll be off. and you're going where? -Paris, i've seen Bermont, the college principal. i told him the whole story,without hiding anything he found me another school. but i really want to work in that field. even if i've been stupid it's a shame at your age to carry all that useless pain hello?ah, it's you,and your Conference,interesting? ...yeah yeah, we're fine. don't worry if i don't answer tomorrow morning. I'll be gone.The Doctor wants me to pass some tests...routine stuff, nothing serious. nah, don't bother,i'll be back in the afternoon.. .yeah, of course. me too, kisses...bye. emma?emma?...mom?mom, where are you? i'm here, ok, what's all that about tests? when do you have to be at the hospital? - i'm not going anymore... false alert. you're putting me on? -your coffee is warm, eat. you've eaten nothing. ok, this doctor and test story,it's a joke? -and you, your conference story? why are you playing games? -i'm playing games? where have you been since sunday? told you, a conference. -as if i invaded on your privacy. i never said that -well let me tell you something, you should start thinking about others a little bit. because for you, life is like that: a straight line and what laurent is feeling, you don't give a shit i have something else to tell you. i goofed also. i went to Valincourt, i saw laurent's parents.. told them everything. fuck, of what right did you do that for? - the right to happiness, silly isn't it, but it exists. hold on, you tell me just like that? You're aware of what you've done? how did it go? very bad,i thought amongst intelligent people i could tell them.. explain what i had lived through... and Laurent, where is he now? -he said he wanted to go to Paris. But he's still here,his train leaves in an hour only. he doesn't know you're here. -you're unsufferable Laurent?...Laurent! fuck, i'm sorry, i didn't know you were coming back. -it's ok, you can stay no no , got a train to catch i really fucked up. I salvaged what i could, but the program is ruined. Emma told me everything -so?what does it change? Anyway i've told nothing to my parents, so i'm still virgin ah, bah. -the only new thing is i'm off to Paris. Laurent? won't you say goodbye? goodbye... and thanks hey? -even after what i did? bah,anyway, i should have done it myself -above all, when you get to Paris, call your mom.It's important to have a mom, as it's wonderful to have kids can i drive you? -yeah, at least this way i won't miss my train. hello?..speaking...Jeanne? no, no he's gone. -did he tell you where? no, i only know he's got a school transfer, to Paris...Jeanne?..Jeanne? we just lost Laurent. -we'd already lost him don't you understand we'll never see him anymore? -perhaps better that way. if he'd come back, i couldn't have taken it...i would have left. i'm a selfish bastard laurent. Emma was right.I have no right to expect others to do as i do. if i've hurt you, i'm sorry. you hear? i love you..i love you. take me to Valencourt. and Laurent? haven't seen him in ages. he's ok i hope? -yeah yeah, he's fine. excuse me. can you come over, we have customers. vitamins.. you prefer caplets or drops? -drops! caplets,i... ok, i don't give a damn if you don't want to see me anymore..I don't want to lose you. -excuse me,do you mind if we carry on in the other room? i'll be in the car. excuse me, but i'm in a hurry. why did you bring me in here? as far as i'm concerned, i'm not ashamed. i don't think people care to hear it. so stop thinking about you only. have you thought about us a bit? -that's all i've ever done all my life, thinking about you. So let me talk alright? you know cedric... i'm in love with him. ..yeah, i love him. Yes, i love a guy, i know you can't bear the idea, but that's how it is. it's not a matter of being gay or whatever, it's simply a matter of love. dad, it's not your fault, it's not mine either. You had no say in this, and neither had i. please, just give me some more time Oh Shit, i feel high now. - ah yeah? well it's now that i'm starting to flip. why? because we got nothing to fight over anymore. -sure sure, i'll find you some. by the way, i have to tell you something important. -go ahead now i know your parents -uhuh? be cool and don't force me to see them again? -ok, but if your mom starts consulting tomorrow..? ok -ok? bastard - dirty faggot!
