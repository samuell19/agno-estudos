RECORD AND CASSETTE STORE Buy it! Don't miss the bargain. These are 10 to 15 dollars only. Take it, if you like it. May I use the phone? Over there. How can I wear this? It's too much. -I bet your boyfriend would love it. -Be serious. Hello? Inspector Lau Ting Kwong, please. Yes, please. Hey! What a coincidence! -Calling the cops? -Stop messing around. Hey, Chun, this is Wah... Quit the act! -What is it? -Don't move! Let go of me! You snitch! Don't run! Come back here! What are you looking at? Move. Don't just stand there. Stand back! Stay away! Stay back! Inspector Lau. The victim is Chan Kam Wah, also known as Wah. With seven knife wounds, he bled to death. He was making a call from that shop when three men attacked him. The owner is making a statement now. I told you, I didn't see them. How do you know there were three men? I couldn't see clearly in such chaos. What were you doing then? Packing. While someone is getting killed? The killing has nothing to do with me packing. What's wrong with that? I believe he didn't see anything. Everything here is evidence. Move them back to the station. Sir, you're causing me trouble. Take everything back. Hey! Have some respect for the dead. All right. Find Ko Chow and bring him in. -How many persons, sir? -Cheers! Hey, Chow! Do you have a reservation? Move your hand unless you don't want it. My friend is over there. Chow! -Where is Hung? -Over there! Chow, don't go looking for trouble. This is Tsui's turf. Don't do it. What are you talking about? Shut up! Hung, I will divorce my wife for you. She just wants my money. I'm fine with that. I just want to be with you. Promise me, Hung. What? Are you ignoring me? Hey. I was waiting for you at the Black Swan for two and a half hours. You could've told me you weren't coming. I want you to leave now. Are you blind? I'm talking to my wife. Who's your wife? Don't pick this dumbass just to get even with me. Stop the insults! -Are you hurt when I insult him? -You're crazy. Go back to Lily. There's nothing between me and Lily. That's none of my business. I've called her here to explain. I'm not interested. Is it because I slept with someone, that you're trying to get even? Can you lick me all over like she does? Ko Chow, are you here for trouble? Let's go. Do you want to get beaten up? I'll wait for you outside. I don't want to see you again tonight. No problem! Hey, Lily, you're leaving already? Do you know Mr. Tso? I want you to explain to Hung. What is there to explain? Why did you ask me to go to your house that night? I don't know! Ask Mr. Tso to do the explaining. What? Lily, you can't go yet! Ko Chow! Don't move! Freeze! Lily, don't go! It's none of my business. He asked me to call you. -Stay right here! -Bastard! Stand still! Don't move! Stand still! You are now under arrest. We have reasons to believe you're involved... Let go of me! Go away. Ko Chow! You want to mess with me? Don't move! Go to hell! What is this? It's just an assault. We're not charging you for assault. We have reasons to believe you're involved in a murder. Come with us! Go! It's all right, sit down. It's all right now. -Sir, go easy on my hand. -Move! Sir, what am I doing in the morgue? Quit the bullshit! We found him in the bar. He's also involved in an assault. Bring him in. Move! Uncle, what kind of a joke is this? You never return my calls. This is the only way to reach you. Come here! Do you know him? That's Wah. When did he die? Be serious! Do you know his background? Typical hoodlum, whoring and gambling. In heavy debt. Not worth shedding a tear. Then you don't know him at all. He was an undercover agent like you. A police officer. He joined the force before you. He was investigating a criminal group planning to rob a jewelry factory. He called me earlier tonight to provide some information. He couldn't reach me, and now he's dead. I think those guys did it. Chow, I want you to take over Wah. I've already tendered my resignation. I never received it. I want out! Only you know the people around Wah. That's why I need you. Get on it right away. Those guys may act soon. After Shing's case, I've made it clear to you. I don't want to go undercover anymore. You gave Shing away, I arrested him. Anything wrong? I betrayed a friend! Shing was scum! Drug dealing, loan sharking, he's nothing good! You're a cop. You have your duties! Duties? I betrayed my friend! We went through life and death! He even took a few stabs for me! You won't understand the brotherhood. I don't want to go undercover anymore. Just let me go, please? You haven't seen your grandma for a long time. I can't believe you sold me out, Chow! I will never rest in peace! I will never rest in peace! Shing! -Police! Run! -Run! Bony, order take-out. -Stay calm. -Yes, Tiger. Tiger, you keep an eye on them. Don't shoot unless it's necessary. We don't want to leave any trace. Don't worry. Tiger. Ready? Always. This is not my kind of gun. Put that away. You look scary enough. Get out. -Stand guard. -Yes! What is it? Wait! Can't even wait a second? -Please don't kill me. -Shut up! Get in! Robbery! Don't move! Robbery! Don't move! Robbery! Stand by the wall! Stand by the wall! Move! Get out! Hurry! Hurry up! Stand by the wall! Move! Stand by the wall! Stand by the wall! What are you looking at? Stop staring! Don't move! Or I'll shoot! No one shall move! -What happened? -Robbery! No one shall move! Open the door! Leaving? Where can you go? That's what you get for leaving. Stay there! Get up! Open the safe! Don't you dare play dead. Stay there! Stop! Stay away! Don't! You'll kill him! -Don't stop me! -Stop! How is it? They're fighting inside, Boss. Go to hell! Stop it! Stay away! Do you want to die? Are you guys crazy? Get out! I said get out! Is the safe open? He wouldn't open it. Just cooperate and you'll be fine. Give us the combination! No? Eat this! What is the combination? Thirty to the left. Seventeen to the right. Fifteen to the left. Take care of it! Miss, take care of him. Open the door! Tell them to hurry up! Robbery! There's a robbery! Help! There's a robbery! Robbery! Sir, there's a robbery! Up there! There are a few of them! Nam, they're in trouble. What shall we do? Where? Hurry! This way! Call the headquarters. Something happened upstairs. Headquarters, this is PC 2697, do you copy? Dispatch to Cheung Kong Industrial Building. I'll head up with Chan to check it out. Over and out. Sir! -Stand aside! -Don't move! -Stay still! -Don't shoot! Shut up, bitch! Don't move! Help! Someone's been shot! Run! There's been a shooting! -Where are they? -Still up there! Nam, Tiger, I have to go. Bony, if you run, I'll shoot you! Sit down! Help! Tiger, get in! Hurry! They're still up there! Freeze! Are you okay? Get in! Start the car, hurry! What's wrong with this gun? It's on fire! What a fire! Move aside! Inspector Lau, Inspector Chow is over there. Chow. What's going on? There were six robbers. They disconnected the alarm from the lobby and robbed Wing Hang Jewelry on the 13th floor. They took 1.2 million worth of jewelry. They were armed with two revolvers and acted real quick. They had a gunfight with our team. It's an organized and well-planned robbery. Not some random robbers. Are they really that good? Any leads? We could only find some shell casings and a lighter. Any witness? Are there? They wore masks. One of the suspects wore a brown jacket and a pair of dark-colored sunglasses. We're working on the sketch. John, what do you think? Not much to go by, but don't worry, I'll solve the case soon. Don't worry, Uncle Lau, I can do it. Kid, which district are you from? I transferred John from the headquarters. -You've met him before. -I don't think so. -Uncle Lau! -Inspector Lau will do! All the same. It's out of respect. Lau, John will head a special unit to solve the case. There has been a few big cases in this district recently. I'm here to help. Sir, what I need the most is the information in Lau's hands. You two will be working together. Lau, you've been a great help to me. I hope you understand. I'll wait for the report at the station. The shoes are too tight. Who is this? -It's you? -It's you? That's too much. -What are you doing here? -Waiting for you. -Nice physique. -What? Of course, I exercise every day. I thought you underwent surgery. Go to hell! That hurts! Don't light it if you don't want to. All right, I'll light it. You asshole! It's hot! Where have you been tonight? I went on a date! -With Mr. Tso? -Yes! No problem! -Where are you going? -Toilet! -To pee? -Yes! -I want to go, too. -After you. -Maybe not now. -You think it's funny? -What a pair, you two even pee together. -Not bad. -He needs to be beaten up. -Who? Who went out with her tonight? I did! Try harder! I'll beat you up too! I'm so lucky! You bastard! Kiss all you want! Darling, don't catch a cold. I think it's time for you to leave. It's stormy outside. Where can I go? Go to hell! Listen to my last words, then. We're disturbing the neighbors. -A robbery happened this afternoon... -That disturbs the neighbors. So what? There was a crossfire between the police and the robbers. One cop was dead, five were wounded. All six robbers escaped. Inspector Lau has no comment about it. But Inspector Chan from the newly-set-up Special Unit said, "The case needs to be solved soon, and that is the main objective of the Special Unit." That's all for Special News Report. Let's take a bath together. Hey, I'm here too! That stinks. Nonsense! I'm only peeing! Your piss stinks. I can't stand the two of you. -Hey. -What now? Leave us alone then. I'm staying with Hung tonight. A threesome? You're too kind. -You wish. -Very much so. You're disgusting! Here I come! -Get out or I'll accuse you of rape! -I'm here. -Nonsense, we're husband and wife! -Help! It's none of my business. -Help! -Come on, baby. What does that mean? I'll swallow it if you don't want it. I finally got what you wanted. Who wants your stupid ring? You can't propose in the bathroom. Not that I've made the deposit, give me the goods. Don't drop me! I won't fall from horse riding. Who the hell is calling me now? -Who's calling you? -Let me return the call. Don't! This call is very important! Who's calling you? My grandma. I have to go! You're leaving now? If you leave, don't ever come back! Forcing me again. All right, I'm coming! Coming! Coming, who is it? It's me, Grandma! It's Puppy! Uncle Kwong. You haven't been here for so long, I almost didn't recognize you. For you. -What is it? -Your favorite. -Maltose? -Right! I have no teeth now. Your uncle has been drinking since he came home. He was cursing you as he drank. Take a look at him. Go. Be good. You've had enough to drink. Chow brought in a kid today to replace me. Like I don't exist! I may be old but I won't give up. -That's enough. -Leave me alone! I've been a cop for over 30 years. I risked my life for this title! Not through examinations. Not like them. I have more certificates and medals than Chow. Son. You've been perfect. But you died too young. Leaving me with no help. I know I'll catch those bastards! Those who should be dead are alive, and those who should be alive are dead. Don't be like this. Get up. -Get out! -Uncle! Leave me alone! Uncle! -Hey, Tai Song! -Hello, Chow. Take a seat! Long time no see. What's up? If I'm doing well, I won't come to you. I have some debts. They'll come after me sooner or later. If we managed to do this, we'll make a fortune. -Are you afraid? -Me? I have guns. -You do? -It's a sure thing. -All right, I'll think about it. -Be quick then. Oh, winning Oh, winning I'm winning Over there. -Tiger, Chow. -Tiger. Name your price. 30,000 for this one, 25,000 for the other. Six for six. That's expensive. -There's also my commission. -What? How much is your commission? Ten percent. You're robbing me. You rob too. Go away! -Here you go. -Thank you. Supply is short so it's expensive. Sometimes you can't get it even if you have money, right? You really know the market. I'm just stating the facts. I'll think about it. We'll meet again. -Sure. -Waiter! It's on me. Go ahead. The one in the gray jacket is Ko Chow. You think he's involved in the robbery? Yes. -Here it is. -Yes. Don't cry. Good. Wah, this is for you. This is for you. This man killed Wah. Do you know him? This is the suspect of the robbery. His face is covered. How can I identify him? Uncle, CIDs are following me. Must be John's group. I don't care whose group is it. I can't help you if you don't sort this out. When you make the deal, record the conversation as evidence in the future. Where are the guns? Mongkok Bowling Center. Giving the guns to the criminals is irresponsible. If you didn't sell to them, they will get them somewhere else. We won't know how many guns we'll have to deal with. We'll lose track. We're not doing anything wrong. Let's see. Wah! Sister-in-law! Wah! How can you leave us? Wah! What shall I do? Wah! For two? This way, please. He's already here. How are you? -Have you been here for long? -Just a while. -What would you like? -Coffee! Two coffees, please. I went with Hung to try on wedding gowns and she looks amazing. You're so lucky. Really? Your suit is ready. Go try it on when you're free. -Yes. -All right. We'll register at 10:00 a.m. the day after tomorrow. Don't tell me you're busy then. Relax, you said that many times. You just can't wait to get married. This guy is forgetful. Rose and I went house hunting. I want to sell the old one and get a bigger one. -What do you think? -No problem. Why are you so quiet? Not feeling well? No. Hung, I want to postpone our registration. Why? I have something to do. It won't take long to sign. We'll register after I finish the job. What is so important? Don't bother. It's the same, just later. No! Why must we postpone? -Just wait till I finish the job-- -Wait? I've waited for years. You won't even go try on the suit. It's not easy to get an appointment. What have you done for the wedding? You guys should talk about it calmly. If you don't want to marry me, just forget it! -Hung. -Look out for her. Waited long? Here's some food, Tiger. Where's Tai Song? Was it necessary to come this far? Where's your boss? I didn't bring them, I owe you six. Touch all you want! Search all you want! Forget about the deal if you don't trust me! You're not afraid to die? You finally speak! I thought you were mute! You asshole, you've got guts. Have you ever died before? Half dead. I don't think you'll kill me. It won't do you any good. It just causes you trouble. Fine. The bullets are expensive. It's a waste to test them on you. You owe me six bullets and five guns. I only have three. When will you have them? The day after tomorrow. See you here at noon. Be careful, kid! -Any room available? -Yes, follow me. -Do you want a girl? -No. You're not afraid to die? You finally speak! I thought you were mute. You asshole, you've got guts! What have you been doing? We went to his workplace yesterday. He didn't go to work. We waited all night but there was no sign of him. What about his girlfriend's place? Our team is monitoring. Nothing too. I don't care how you do it, I just want him. Put more men on it! We need to prove ourselves to that old man. Stay alert! Uncle, they want three more guns. That much? I made up that number. How generous of you. Tomorrow at noon in the cemetery. I won't have the guns until 10:00. That's a bit late. I need time to apply for them. Tomorrow at 10:00. I'll place them in the same locker, okay? As if I had a choice. Have you handed in my resignation? There's no hurry. I'm serious. After the deal, I don't want to get involved anymore. All right, I got it. -I'm leaving. -Okay. Isn't she pretty? Yes, but looks aren't everything. College student, doesn't drink or smoke. She can even cook. That's enough. Chow. No more fooling around. Please reconsider, Hung. Chow is not that heartless. Don't mention him again! Mr. Tso is married. He's probably lying about the divorce. Rose! You should go home. I'll call you when I've arrived in Canada. It must be Chow! No, it's Rose. Hold on! It's him. Talk to him. I have nothing to say. Chow, Hung is leaving tomorrow with Mr. Tso. What? They're taking the 2:00 p.m. flight to Canada. Damn it. Put Hung on the phone! Calm down. Come talk to her now! Rose, hang up! Did you hear me? Hung! Hung, I beg you. Talk to him, please. Ko Chow, what do you want? Are you leaving with that bastard? Yes, what about it? What do you want me to do? Nothing! Hung, I'll marry you. I mean it. Give me a chance, will you? I'll go there now, okay? You don't have to. If you mean it, meet me at 10:00 at the registry tomorrow. Hung! He will be here. We lost Little Black. -He's right in front of us. -Move. Hurry up. He's on Nathan Road heading south, reaching Cheung Lok Street. Turning into Nanking Street. Faster! Go! Uncle, what's going on? You told me to get the guns but CIDs are on my tail! Ditch them! They are not my men! Possession of a weapon is a felony! Relax! I'll cover you. How? You can only keep me out of jail! If I blow my cover, people will come after me! We have leads that the robbers are buying from another source. You must deliver the goods today at noon or we'll lose track! Uncle, this is too much. I'll get rid of the CIDs for you. Move now! What shall I do now? Get the guns from Bowling Center! John, I want you to pull your men. Leave Ko Chow alone. Who do you think you are talking to? Ko Chow is my informer. Really? He's into illegal betting, drug trafficking and loan sharking. How is he your informer? Just stop tailing him. No. I suspect him of arms dealing and the Wing Hang robbery. Even if he's your informer, I can't help you. I need Ko Chow in a big case. Let's set aside our differences and take care of business first. This is strictly business. I'm upholding justice. No favors, even for senior officers. I'll not be this nice. Uncle Lau, only wine gets better with age. Kid, pull your men! Old man, this is my office. Only I can give orders. Please let passengers exit first. -Make way! -After him! Make way! Please stand clear of doors. Watch out! We'll get you! Stop! You won't get away! We'll get you! Thank you. Stand still! I told you to stand still. Are you all right? Go after him! Stop! Watch out! Get in! Check over there! You want to get caught? Wait! Stop! How did you know I'm here? Where did you pick up the stuff last time? I am very careful. I've been followed. You have to be careful from now on. You're lucky this time. Aren't we going to the cemetery? I'm taking you somewhere else. I'm in a hurry. Let's make the deal here. My boss wants to see you. Three guns and 200 bullets, all here. -Don't move! -Great. Wait a minute, what do you want? Boss, I want to sign on the gun. You want to get arrested? 10,000 each, 100,000 in total. Thank you, Boss. Ko Chow, join us. I'm planning a big job, are you in? Thanks for the appreciation. Tiger seldom praises anyone. Thank you. Tai Song said you're planning a big one. We think the same way. Let's work together. Ko Chow, we'll be rich if we work together! All right, let me introduce them to you. This is Bill, Bony, and Joe. We're all brothers. I always look after my brothers. If we work together, nothing will go wrong. Let me consider. Ko Chow, this is a good chance. Excuse me, I'm in a hurry. Fine, tell Tai Song when you've decided. I'll be in touch. I'll drive you out. I have to go, see you. Where are you going? The airport. -Where is she? -Over there. Hung! Hung! Don't move! Ko Chow, you're under arrest on suspicion of arms possession. If you go, don't ever come back! Don't move! -Hung! -Let's go! Move! Get in! Stand up! Sir, we found these in his bag. Is this the money from the deal? Who's the buyer? I need to call my lawyer. Chow! You bastard! I'll kill you! Lau, stop it! Get out of my way! Old man, you can't scare me! I'm used to it! -Get off me! -Lau, stop! What are you two doing? Sir, Lau tried to shoot me! Put down your gun! This is not allowed in the station. Release him! Hurry up! Both of you! In my office! Man, look after him! Close the door! I asked you to cooperate with each other, not fight! What happened? I arrested Ko Chow. I suspect he's involved in the robbery and arms dealing. He was about to testify, Lau stopped it! Lau, don't you want to solve the case? Ko Chow is my informer. So? You shouldn't cover for him. That's bullshit! I arranged him for the deal. What? Are you mad? Watch what you're saying! Lau! What do you mean? Explain now! Sir, I was hoping to use this deal to infiltrate the organization and arrest them. Now, they have the guns. We can arrest them. Hold on! We can only charge them with arms possession. We can't charge them based on intentions. There are three to four members in the group. As long as one of them plead guilty, the rest go free. We will only alert them. They have guns now, so they must be planning to make their move soon. We should wait and catch them red-handed. I disagree! If there is a crossfire, it will endanger innocent bystanders. Ridiculous! Do you know how many lives we can save? Be careful with your words! Lau, we're discussing business here. I think Ko Chow should join the robbery. With his help, we'll get them. No! I promised to let him go after the deal. If he refuses, I'll charge him. He'll be imprisoned for eight to ten years. Kid, you have no grounds to charge him. He's not an ordinary informer. He's one of our undercover agents. Check the files if you don't believe me. That's even better. We'll just send him undercover again. I object! It's too dangerous. Sir, you wanted me to set up the Special Unit to solve the case. This is the best choice. Under the current legal system, we need to arrest them red-handed to have them punished by law. I agree we should wait. Lau, tell Ko Chow to join the robbery. Sir, if you insist, I will resign. Lau, don't you want to solve the case? What about Wah's and others' sacrifices? These four jewelry shops are the targets. According to Ko Chow, they have something in common. They all have valuable jewelry, weak security, and are in busy locations, making it easy to escape. John, what do you think? We should send our team to guard these four shops. We should call the Special Duty Unit. We don't have to. We can handle it. They are not some random criminals. If there's a crossfire and the innocent get hurt, who's responsible for that? All right, call SDU for backup. Looks good. What's so funny? You failed. Ko Chow, you got a letter from the US. Go to hell. You're awfully quiet. Are you mad at me? What's wrong with you? Cheer up! Cheer up! Great! Ko Chow, drink with me. -This wine is expensive. -Don't be so stingy! -You talk too much. Finish this. -No! Are you trying to take advantage? That's none of your business. Trying to take advantage? Excuse me. Can you take a photo for us? Get closer. Hold on. Smile. -Tiger. Ko Chow. -Shut the door. -Tiger. -Where's the boss? In the room. Wake up! This is not your bedroom. Boss. Boss! I asked you all to be here tonight to announce that we're going to execute the plan soon. Good, we're going to be rich! Why? Aren't you happy? Smile! Boss, are the guns any good this time? Relax! We'll score this time. If the cops intervene, they'll die. Joe, for security purposes, nobody leaves this room from now on. Cut off all communication. If you need anything, come to me. If you have no objection, hand in your pagers. Hurry! In the meantime, I want you to study the route. Which shop is our target? I'll tell you when the time comes. Paul, ask everyone to standby. The robbers will take action any minute. Everyone, standby. -Any news? -No. John, Chan was here earlier. He feels that six teams guarding four jewelry stores on rotation are not enough. Who is Chan? There are 48 men in 6 teams! That's more than enough! We're dealing with a few robbers, not an army! Get him here! HAND OVER TO TSIM SHA TSUI POLICE STATION INSPECTOR LAU TING KWONG What are you doing? Nothing, I'm having diarrhea. Who is this? My girlfriend. Not bad, right? What will you do with the money? What about you? Spend it and look for another job. You'll get caught. Quit it, don't jinx me. Why don't you start a small business? What business? I can't even read. I'm destined to follow my father's footsteps. My old man was a thief just like his old man. I hope my son will not be one. Is your father still in jail? He's dead for more than 10 years. He was foolish, tried to rob the police dorm. He was killed by the cops. Is that why you hate cops? Not really, he chose his end. We're expected to risk our lives. This racket has been on all night. They're having a party. Where's your son? My wife took him when she remarried. I only have myself to blame. -Where's your family? -They're all dead. At least you have a beautiful girlfriend. If I were you, I would get a job. I was stupid when I was younger. I was smarter then. My girlfriend just ran off with someone else. What a coincidence! We need to celebrate then. For her elopement? No, for us being involved in the same business. During festivals, my wife still sends me a card. What about you? Of course! Don't lie, you're just saying. This is from the USA. Where did you find this piece of crumpled paper? You should have gone to school. Look, it says Mr. Ko. Do you know English? How did you know? It's sealed, so it means you don't have the guts to read it. Read it. You'll feel better. Don't give up if you still have a chance. Chow, I didn't go to Canada. I went to Hawaii from San Francisco. I wish you would take me home. My address is on the envelope. I miss you, Hung. Chow, I can't believe you sold me out! I will never rest in peace. I will never rest in peace! Are you scared? Your first time? You won't feel it there and then. Get some sleep. Where is the SDU? They are just waiting for nothing. It's a waste of taxpayers' money. Get me Inspector Chow. Hurry! It was his decision. Boss! Everybody, look at these babies. Model 357! And model 45! Tiger, try this! Brothers, we're making our move soon. Check your equipment. We're getting rich soon. Happy now, Joe? Yes! When the job is done, we'll regroup at the mine. We'll leave by boat early tomorrow morning. Boss, which store is our target? I'm sure you've familiarized the route. Our target is Tai Kong Jewelry Store. Good! This is killing me! Still no news. I wonder how long we'll have to wait. If anything happens, I'll be waiting on Mody Road. Don't move, this is a robbery! Don't move! Don't move or I'll shoot! Pack everything! Put them in the bag, quick! Hurry up or I'll shoot! Headquarters calling Team 2. Why is there a taxi outside Tai Kwong? Team 2, do you copy? Probably just waiting for a fare. Who triggered the alarm? You called the cops? Don't move! Lie down! Robbery at Tai Kong Jewelry Store! All teams, head out there! Miss! Tiger, let's go! Take it easy! Hurry! Go! Joe, pack up and get in the car! Leave it, Ko Chow! Let's go! Get in, Bony! Lie down! Get in! Bill! Bill! Get in! Bill, are you all right? Are you all right, Bill? Joe, look out! -Joe, stop the car! -I'll show them! Joe, stop the car! Shut up! The police are right behind us! Get out! Joe, get out! Bill! Go, Tiger, go! Tai Song, go for that car! Tiger! Let's surrender! I don't want to hear that! Joe! Joe! You bastards! Get out here! Joe! Give me the gun! Tiger! Chow! Drive the car here! -Are you all right? -I'm fine! I'll seek revenge! Don't go out there! It's a lost cause! Relax, I'm here. I'm counting on you to get me to Hawaii to meet my wife. I'll go with you. Get out here! Tai Song, you ready? Ready? Sit tight! Tiger! Get in! Hurry! Hurry up! Don't move! -Where are the robbers? -They've escaped. How did that happen? Kwong is dead. Any leads? Looks like Lau found something. Yung! What have you got? Three dead, five wounded. Happy now? Lau, if we don't work together, we won't catch them. I found Chow's wallet in the taxi. Get out! Where are Bill and Joe? They're dead. Bony, hide the car. This robbery was so well-planned, yet there was still a lot of police. There must be a traitor among us! It's you! Me? If I'm the traitor, you would've been arrested by now! I wouldn't need to risk my life. -Boss, it's not Chow. -Shut up! He's the new guy. Who else can it be? I don't think he's the traitor. Yes, he's our brother. Go to hell! I'm sure! I've been around for too long. If I'm wrong, you're in bad luck-- Let's sort things out! Tiger, have you gone mad? Pointing your gun at the Boss? Put down the gun! Take it easy or you're dead! It's fine. You can split my share. No, you saved my life. I owe you! I'll kill whoever touches you. Boss, tell me what you want me to do! -Don't move! -Stand back! Boss, the police are here. We'll deal with this later! Tai Song, pack and leave! Ko Chow, let's go. We've been surrounded. Get down! Chow, are you all right? Hang in there! This is the police, you have been surrounded. Put down your weapons and surrender yourselves! Surrender? Over my dead body! Listen! If you don't surrender, we'll go in! John, Ko Chow is inside. We have to try to catch them alive. Do you know the robbers are armed? They can't escape. They'll surrender. I'm in charge here, you have no right to speak. You better pray that nothing happens to Ko Chow. Man, get Inspector Chow! Tai Song! I'll go head-to-head against them! Tai Song! Tai Song! Don't shoot! I surrender! -Don't shoot! -Don't you dare! Boss! Don't force me to do this! I don't want to die! Put the gun down! -Tiger! -Calm down! I told you to put down the gun! You bastard! Bony! How dare you kill Bony? I'm the boss here! Where's your respect? We've risked our lives for you! We've always respected you! Did you really do so? Chow! Chow! Chow, let's go. Hang in there. I'm done. You have to go. I won't leave you behind. I am a cop. What did you say? I'm a cop. What did you say? If you want to kill me, do it now, or you won't have the chance anymore. Tell me you are not a cop! I betrayed you. Cops and robbers can never be on the same side. I owe it to you. Kill me now. Get down! Don't move! Chow. We're going to go to Hawaii. Chow! Get up! Move! Move! Get him in. Don't move! Sit down! Sir, I didn't let you down. The special unit has cracked a big case in less than two months. I'll submit the report soon. John! There's your goddamn medal! John, are you all right?
