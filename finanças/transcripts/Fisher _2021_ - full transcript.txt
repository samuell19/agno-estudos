This one might get me 20 bucks. Shit! Shit! Shit! - Hey, hey Keith. - What? Man, I'm a little low on funds Oh Yeah? but do you mind if I give you what I've got and you front me the rest? Come on man. I'm jonesing. Seriously, again? fuck no! Keith? Keith? Shit! Dammit! Asshole! Ugh... uh... What the fu...! Let's see what you got for me today... What the hell? They defiled themselves by their evil deeds and their love of idols was adultery in the Lord's sight. From Channel 5 Eyewitness news, this is a special report. Good Morning. Investigators are currently on the scene of what appears to be homicide. Late last night, a man was brutally beaten to death, and it wasn't until early this morning that a passerby discovered his body. The victim has been identified as 26-year-old Marcus Daniels of Eden, Tennessee. Unfortunately, officers are not being forthcoming with the details of the brutal nature of this attack. However, as more information is released, we will keep you, our viewers, updated. This has been Dinah Knight with Channel Five, Eyewitness News, Oak Ridge. We now return you to your regularly scheduled programming. Oh, shit! Good Morning, Deja Good morning Mr. Banks. Is Clara ready to go? She's running late as usual. If you wanna come on in and wait, she'll be ready in a few. Okay, cool. So anything new? Are you guys staying out of trouble? - Of course. - Okay. Hey Deja, I just made some coffee. Did you want some? No, I'm not a coffee person. You know I drink so much coffee, my blood type is caffeine positive. Good one. Mr. Banks. Hey Deja, I got to leave would you do me a favor? Have Clara pick up some Halloween candy for me after school. - All right. - Thank you. I got to leave and go out of town for work, I know I'll forget. Thank you. - No problem. See you. - Bye. What? What's this? I didn't know you were into girls. I'm not. I just borrowed some pictures from the nice ladies on the internet. Okay... but for what though? And we were those people we were talking to? Some of those messages were hella dirty. It's just a game I play. A game? That's no game I know of. I made it up. I went onto one of those lonely hearts sites and started messaging random guys. So how do the pictures come into play? Well, those women are who they think they're talking to. So you're catfishing guys? Yeah! It's pretty great. I send them dirty pictures and messages and in return they send me free stuff. They're sending you things? They're buying you things? Yeah. Oh, where do you think I got this new top? Thank you Skydaddy13. They're sending things to your house? Isn't that dangerous? No, they don't send things to my house. They send me e-gift cards and then give me the code. I'm not that stupid. So what do you do when they want see you in person? Well, that's when Jezebel Reigns disappears like a thief into the night, pun intended. Girl, you're crazy! Crazy good at getting free stuff! Geez... Are you done? Um... Almost. You're making us late, hurry up. So how long have you been catfishing those guys? About eight months now. And how many? Currently only two. At one point there were four, but the other two weren't falling for it. Doesn't your dad think it's weird that you keep getting all these packages in the mail? A UFO could land in our backyard and my dad wouldn't notice. Speaking of your dad, he told me to ask you about getting some Halloween candy, something about him being out of town this weekend? And that right there is why he never notices anything. He's always working. Ever since mom died, he's never home. And Halloween isn't even until next Friday. Maybe he just has a lot on his mind. You know I'm here for you, right? Yeah. I know. That's why you're my bestie. Thanks again for picking me up. My car is not gonna be out of the shop until next Tuesday. Girl, I got you anytime. So, how are you and Shawn? I don't really talk to him now and I need to focus on school. Really though? He was so cute. Yeah... What are you looking at freak? Deja! Oh, It's fine Clara. So I hear you're applying for Princeton, Deja. I hope you can make the grade. I don't need your hope, I know what I can do. Sorry. What was that all about? Why do you hate him so much? He creeps me out. He gives me creepy stalker vibes. He's not that bad. Says you. I call it like I see it. Mmm hmm... So see you in second period. You ready for that test? Honey, I was not only born fabulous, but always on the ready. Dork! Only dork I see is the one approaching. - See you. - See you. Quit... stop, you know I hate that. I just can't help it. You're so hot. I know I am. So you coming to my game later? I can't, I have to work on the trunk or treat display. Lame. Is your dad gonna be home this weekend? We could study the human anatomy. Perv. It's girls only this weekend. Call me "Chadra." I'll make you a bikini out of whipped cream. Girls only. I mean it Chad. Whatever you say babe. You're missing out on my craft skills. I'm sure they're at expert level. Text me later? Will do. Watch where you're going Jesus freak! Good morning to you too, Chad. Hey, I'm sorry about Chad earlier. He gets defensive when he's embarrassed. It's okay, sometimes you just have to turn the other cheek on little things like that. I'm still sorry he pushed you. Your presentation looks really good. It has a lot of detail. Mine's awful. Where did you learn to do that? Oh..um... My Mom is a computer programmer at Oak Ridge and she's been teaching me how to do these things since I was five. It kinda became how we bonded. Excuse me, Ms. Blaylock, Micah Green is needed in the principal's office. Class! Class that is enough. Dammit He's always in trouble. Thought you were funny with your little trick huh? Whose laughing now? Dick. Bitch. Well, come in. Do you know why I called you in here today? 'Cause you missed seeing my handsome face? Mr. Green, this is not a time for jokes. The allegations made against you are very serious. Do you have your laptop with you? Yeah. May I have it, please? Can I have your password please? Can't remember all of a sudden. Now, Mr. Green... It's okay. I've already accessed what I needed. The IP address matches. Mr. Green... your actions are very serious and it is illegal. I'm gonna have to inform the authorities, your father, and suspend you as well. May I make a suggestion? In lieu of calling the authorities. Why not have Mr. Green help out with the preparations for the trunk or treat? I find community work to be very educational for our youth. Idle hands are the devil's playground after all. I'm still going to have to call your father and suspend you for a week. Wait outside my office for your father. And Mr. Green, there cannot be a repeat of this. Thank you so much for your help, Betty. Oh, that's fine. I'm always happy to help. I had to pick up some art supplies for the trunk or treat anyway. I better be off, lot's to do before I have to pick up Jacob. Mr. Green, there's been an incident here at the school. We need you to come pick up your son. I got some tea to spill. So stalker boy hacked into the school's main computer. Seriously, how do you know that? Our progress reports were passed out today in class and I had all F's, I've never gotten an F in my life. Stupid bustard gave himself away with a snide ass remark this morning. Holy crap. Are you serious? Yes, those are my grades Clara. He screwed with my grades. I'm trying to get into Princeton, okay. This is not okay that he would do that. What the hell were you thinking?!? You listen to me boy. I am damn tired of your shit. I had to leave work to come down here. Sorry! You're sorry? I'm losing money because of your horse shit. And you think sorry is gonna make up for that? You're gonna be sorry. Get your ass in that truck. I feel so bad for him. I don't. He did it to himself. We still on for this weekend? Yeah, Kimmy's coming over after work. Okay, cool. You ready for this test? You know with all that commotion, I almost forgot about it. Let's just get it over with. Boy... you are lucky I did not get fired today. I already said I'm sorry. Bullshit! I am sick of your shit Micah! Like mom was tired of yours? - What did you say? - Nothing. Now what the hell did you just say to me?!? Like mom was tired of yours! Look around you, Micah. Your Saint ain't here. She didn't want you either. Because of you! You're always drunk. You gamble all of our money away. Mom left because of you! Mom knew she- You watch how you speak to me boy. Micah... you get your ass here boy! Shit! Hey Kimmy, I called that prescription in earlier. Oh yeah, yeah... I have that right... right here for you. Don't worry about it. Thanks Hey Mrs. Roberts. Hi Clara, it's nice to see you. I just have a few things to grab, so I'll be right back. Yeah, I'll just work on that right now. What up, loser? Hey Kimmy. Hey Are you still coming over tonight? - Ugh! Do I have to? - Yes. You and Deja with me wanting to come over all the time. I mean, I guess I'll come over, but you know I have to finish up here, just be a couple minutes, is that fine? Could you bring some art supplies? Do I look like I have art supplies? Not really. What are you doing with this? What is this? Are you trying to check out here? Yes This is not a checkout counter, Clara. Okay well... This is a pharmacy counter, Clara! The customer's always right, Kimmy. You can't check out if there's no checkout machine, Clara! ...just gonna buy candy at my pharmacy counter.. I hate this store. I just really want to die all the time... Hi, Mrs. Robert, how are you doing? Did you find everything okay? I did thank you. All right, let me take care of that for you. Okay, are you gonna be gardening today? Hoping to get started. All right, that sounds great. Sounds like a lot of fun. Here's your prescription, that's gonna be 89.95. - All right, there you go. - There you go. Will you need a bag for this? - Oh, I should be fine. - Okay. Thank you. Clara, will we be seeing you and your father at church this Sunday? Of course. We'll definitely be there. Good, it'll be really nice to have you both back. We missed you. And thank you both for offering to help with the trunk or treat the children of Eden will be so thankful, I know I am. Of course, we're more than happy to help. Uh huh... yeah... Great. All right, well, I gotta get going. Oh, before I forget, can I get your email? I'm gonna send you some ideas for the display. Okay, yeah sure. Do you have paper? Mmm hmm.. Yep. Really appreciate your help. Oh yeah... I totally wanted to do that. Great. Okay... - All righty. - Thank you. I'll get that out to you tonight. Okay. Cool. All right. Have a good day girls. You too! I don't remember volunteering for that. You didn't, I volunteered you. Okay, so how are you paying for this? Cash. - Oh, do you have cash? - I do have cash. I'm very impressed with you. I bet you are. I will be taking that and I will be keeping the change 'cause someone needs art supplies, right? See you later. I'm here to pick up my prescription. Absolutely, can I get your last name? Hey hooker, you forget about me? Definitely. Dick. Stupid prick. You're so stupid. God I am so tired of you. - "Oh... your saint ain't here" - because of you, you drunk! Hmm... Silver lining after all. So Kimmy, did you know? Did I know what? About Clara's half naked women she shares online. My God, I didn't know you swung my way. I don't. Well, you should. Come to the dark side we bake cookies. As much as I love cookies and you Kimmy, we both know I'm strictly dickly. So what are you doing? She cons stupid dudes for money. Now, I like to think of it as I fill one of their needs and they fulfill my material needs. Not my fault they're stupid. You should really read this book. How are they falling for this? I mean, it's pretty simple. I send them pictures and they send me gift cards. Everyone's happy. So does Chad know about this? No. And he isn't going to. I mean, they're not my pictures, so it technically isn't even cheating. Girl, you're pulling out every excuse from the book. Only the good ones. Now are we gonna get started on this? Uh... I guess... What's the theme? Um... Actually, let me check. Looks like angels. Angels. Oh God, we're all screwed.. Hey hun? Dinner's ready. Okay, I'll be done in a second. What are you watching? Oh, uh "Mean Girlz". That doesn't sound like a very wholesome film. It's not, but it reminds me of the kids at my school. Is someone being mean to you? No, everything's fine, I promise. - Okay. Now go eat. - Okay. Heavenly Father, we thank you for this food, we pray that it will go to the nourishment of our bodies the way your word nourishes our souls. We thank you for the blessings that you granted us and pray that you continue to guide us, In Jesus name we pray, amen. - Amen. - Amen. Did you do something different with the potatoes? Yes, actually. I'm trying out a new recipe. Well, if it tastes as good as it looks and smells, we have a winner. That's sweet. Thank you. Jacob have you decided whether or not you'll be joining the boys youth group trip for winter break? I hear they have a great time. I don't know, I'm not really into skiing, but some of the boys talked about the Aquarium. Oh the Aquarium? That's where your mother and I went on our anniversary last time. I think you'll like that. Penguins are my favorite. They're just adorable. You say that about all of God's animals though. Yes she does. Yes. That's because I love all God's creations. Betty, that is not what you said about that snake we found on the shade last fall. Okay, maybe most of God's creations, just not the slithering kind. Besides it reminds me of the serpent in Genesis. Just evil. Now, hon. Even the serpent has a purpose in God's plan. That's true. What about you honey? Have you finished your sermon for Sunday yet? Um... not quite... Hey hon. Hey, beautiful. What's up? How long you gonna be? Not long, just got a little bit more to go. What's your topic this Sunday? Temptation. I figured with the holidays just around the corner, temptation is gonna be in abundance. - Mr.Roberts? - Yes. Might I tempt you into coming to bed? Mrs. Roberts, are you coming on to me? What, I'm just fulfilling my wifely duties. Maybe I can show you what that entails. Amen. Hey Jacob, could you come help me out for a minute? Oh Frank, always forgetting to shut down your computer. Well, that smells great, hon. You left computer on again. Hmm..I did? My mind was a little distracted last night. Did you get a chance to look over my sermon for tomorrow? Yes, I did. It was insightful. Still have a few tweaks to make on it, but I think it'd be a great sermon. Maybe you should take your own sermon's advice. I'm sorry hon, what was that? Just that I hope the weather's nice. I really wanted to prune the roses before our first frost. The weatherman says it's gonna be sunny and 72º today. That's good to know. I'm going to go wash up before I eat. Hey mom, can I borrow the laptop for a project? Yeah it's fine. I don't care. Are you okay? Yeah honey, I'm fine. Got some soap in my eyes. Silly, I know. Your breakfast is ready for you in the kitchen. I'm gonna eat in my room. I wanna get this project done. That's fine. Can you help me in the garden later? Sure thing. We've looked at so many of these I'm becoming cross-eyed. I thought that was just your face. Shut up. Seriously Clara can we just wing it? - Well, aren't you just punny? - I thought so. What's that? It's just a new message. - Uh huh, I wanna see. - Yeah, me too. Fine. Anything has to be better than this current craft hell. - Oh, he's thinking of you. - Uh, shut up. Give me. Oh my gosh, what are you typing? You'll see. Done and sent. Good Lord, let's see what you wrote. You scandalous hussy. You wrote it like an erotica novel. I'm scandalous? She's the one who's been stringing him along. Ugh... I'm thinking of you. I wanna put your hands on my body and your lips on mine and put your member? Member?!? Really, really that's what you're focusing on. I mean, it's just weird. Just like you. Come on ladies, we need to focus on why we came here and that is to make a heavenly display. Fine, but I still have glitter stuck to me from last night. Glerpies. Glerpies. You have glitter herpes. Come on! We're never gonna get this done! It's a joke. It was funny. Oh, it looks like he wants to use that member in person. He said he can make your dreams into a reality. Oh Girl, he wants to be the new member in your club. Mmm. Uh uh. Shut up. - You're blushing! - No, I'm not. Yeah you are. You're a virgin. No, she's slept with Chad before. I mean, we've done things. Just not that. Hmm... that's not what I heard. What did you hear? - Don't make me tell her! - Just tell me! Fine. Just don't shoot the messenger. Chad said that he slept with you under the football bleachers. - What? - Are you okay? No! How could he do that?!? What are you going to do? Clara? - I just dumped him. - Really? Yeah. I can't believe he would do that to me. He wasn't good enough for you anyway. I feel so dumb. I mean, don't feel dumb, it's not your fault. And he's the dumb one for losing you, I guess. Do you want me to respond to this? Yeah. Tell him my car's in the shop and that I'll talk to him later. Okay. By the way, uh, Dej can you take me? Wish I could, but mom will have the car, dad's is in the shop, but I could Uber with you though. Thanks. Micah! Micah! Get up! I said get up! What?!? It's Saturday. "Oh it's Saturday." Because of that stunt you pulled yesterday, I get to pull an extra shift at work. If I got to work, you do too. Now get up! I want you out in that truck in five minutes boy. Do not make me wait. Dad's waiting on you in the back Mr. Green. Wait here. What is it, bring your son to work day? Look who's talking. Difference is my dad owns this place. Whatever dude. Come on back Micah. Ohhhhh... I need to start this brake job. I want you to sweep these floors, wash the windows, take out the trash and clean the bathrooms. All right, all the cleaning supplies are over by that closet. Don't just stand there. Get to work, come on. "Lurkers" by Ok Otter Hey, I'm done. What are you doing? Just changing the mats in Clara's car. Well aren't you a good boyfriend. I'm not dating that skank. I just saw you two yesterday. I dumped her and she's gonna pay for it. That doesn't make any sense you dumped... You know what? I don't even care. Where's my dad? He's out front. Wow. We did really well guys. - We? - Yeah, it looks great. Yeah. And you know what? I think it looks really good. I'll be happy to never see glitter again. - Same. - Yeah. What time is it? - It's already 6:30. - I got to go. My mom needs a car back by seven. Yeah, you know, as much as I would love to stay and like stick more dolls on boards with you guys, but like I got to go. You're gonna be all right Clara? Yeah, I'll be fine. Uh, Dad's gonna be back soon. You know what? Let me walk you out. Thanks bro. Uh huh... Angels. Wow. You're not an angel. Did you get your display done? Yeah, we did. Good. What's wrong? You not like it? I thought... I thought that was your favorite. It is, I'm just really not hungry. Is everything okay? Yes. No. I don't know. What's going on? Chad and I broke up. Really? How come? Because he's stupid. Something happen that I need to know about? No. I don't wanna talk about it. Can I please be excused? Yeah. At least eat your fortune cookie, always time for a fortune cookie. Who knows, that may be some good news. Every action has consequence. Shittiest. Fortune. Ever. Hey champ could you make sure the laptop's charged before you go to bed? Sure thing dad. Thanks. I'm gonna turn in for the night hon, you coming? I need to finish this, I'll come to bed later. Are you okay? I'm fine. Just don't forget to take your medication. You know you don't feel right without it. - Good night son. - Night dad. Barking... Stop barking... just stop barking... just..why does it keep barking? Stop barking! Why? Why even have a dog if you're not gonna keep it inside... inside? Are you okay? I just want it to stop... They just don't care. The thought of anybody... Barking all night... Barking all night Why won't it stop? ...won't stop barking! Shh... I'll go talk to the neighbors. You shouldn't hear the dog barking anymore mom. What did you do?!? It doesn't look that deep. come on, let's get you to bed. Love you, Bett. ♪ This little light of mine ♪ ♪ I'm gonna let it shine ♪ ♪ This little light of mine ♪ ♪ I'm gonna let it shine ♪ ♪ This little light of mine ♪ ♪ I'm gonna let it shine ♪ ♪ Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine ♪ Good morning. Who are you saving the seat for? Saving it for Clara. No! Why not? I, um... Her father's coming today. She should sit with him. Oh, okay. Now for 40 days and 40 nights Jesus prayed in the desert, no food, no water. Three times, Satan came to tempt him. Now we read Matthew chapter 4, verse 4, Jesus reply after Satan had told him to turn some stones into bread. And though He was hungry, Jesus replied to Satan, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God." Jesus showed us that even though food could sustaining the body for a time, it can not sustain the spirit. To separate yourself from God is to create spiritual starvation. Now temptation can come in many forms. Like with knowledge... the serpent tempted Eve in the garden Or from those you trust, like Samson did Delilah with the secret to his strength. It is why we must turn to the word of God... for guidance when we're lost, strength when we're weak, for discernment when we're offered things from others. To be aware of wolves in sheep's clothing. And it is only then through Him and only Him that we can overcome temptation. Now, let us pray. Please bow your heads. Heavenly Father we come before you now... We're so glad you and your dad could make it. - I know. - What? Mrs. Roberts, you're hurting me. I'm sorry, I guess I just don't know my grasp sometimes. I just meant that I know I'll be seeing more of you... Yeah. Helping out with the trunk or treat this Thursday! Of course, definitely. Um... I'm gonna go catch up with my dad now. You should probably go catch up. Yeah. Good to see you. Great service... Hey Dej. What's up? Not much just bored. Same. So going back to church today felt really weird. Yeah, I agree. You should have seen the look on Mrs. Robert's face. If looks could kill, you'd be dead. You would swear you were sleeping with her husband. Um... Mrs. Roberts really creeped me out today. Usually she's so sweet, but today she seemed off. That whole family's off. Super nice people creep me out. Nobody can be that nice all the time. I guess. Are you still coming over tonight? Dad's heading out of town soon. Yeah, once my mom picks me up with the car. Okay. See you later then. All right. Bye. Watch out! Those birds are nuts. Shhhhh! Did you know that in Australia they have an actual swooping season? Magpies attack people just like in this movie. Oh my God. You're such a nerd. Didn't know... now, shhhh! It's just the pizza. I completely forgot about it. Oh, hey, could you come inside so you don't let the bugs in? Sure, didn't know you lived here. I didn't know you delivered pizzas. My parents wanted me to learn more about responsibility, so... now I have a job. Your total will be $14.95. Keep the change. Thanks. See you around? We have computer lab together. Oh, you're right. Bye. Bye. I'm so stupid. Why did I say that? You'll never guess who delivered our pizzas. Who? Jacob. Really? I never pictured him as a delivery boy. Well, what did you picture him as? Hmm... future politician. You know it's the hair. I don't know maybe a... did you guys hear that? It's probably the birds coming to end us all. Very funny. I am funny... I'm really funny. But I didn't hear anything. That. It's probably just a twig or something. Or a bird. Okay, definitely not a bird. Clara I don't wanna end up like the next slasher film. Clara don't! Seriously Clara, why don't you just call the cops? I'm not trying to die today. Clara don't! What the fuck?!? You don't think it was Jacob do you? No, it wasn't him. - How do you know? - I just do. Look, I need to clean this up or my dad's gonna freak out. Hello? Is anyone out there? Whoever you are you're not funny. Don't do that! Sorry! Did you see anything? No, just heard a noise, probably just a cat or something. Let's just get this done, I wanna go back inside. Okay. Ugh... gross. I think I've had enough scary movies for one night. Honestly, I was just about to say the same thing. Wanna watch something funny before bed? Read my mind. Well, I think that's enough fun for tonight. I'm freaked the fuck out and I have worked in the morning. So I will be taking this. - Deserter. - I'm a survivalist. "Bock bock". "Bock Bock"..nuhhhh... See you guys later. What a weird night. Why is everyone staring? I don't know. No way, I'm not doing that. That's mean. Fine. Then I will. Skank. What did you say?!? I said... skank! What's that? You guys are dicks! We didn't print them. Damn, look who's desperate for attention. Is that how you get guys now? If I find out you had anything to do with this, I'll beat your ass. - I'm not afraid of you. - You should be. I like you all fiery, Deja. Maybe you could show me in another way. If you ever bother her again, I'll kill you! Damn dude, you just got dropped. Shut up. Aww, we both know you ain't got none anyway. Just another psycho... lets go. Clara. Are you okay? No, I'm not. Okay. Why don't you come and take a walk with me and we can talk where there's less prying eyes. Come on. Look, we can go over there and talk on that bench, okay? Come on, I have some time. Come on, we have a seat. Do you wanna tell me what happened? It's embarrassing. I can't help you if you don't let me in. I do want to help. But there's nothing covered up that will not be revealed and hidden that will not be known. What? The Bible verse at the bottom of the picture, Luke 12:2. What does it mean? Well, Clara, it looks like somebody thinks you have a secret they want shared. Do you have a secret, Clara? What? No! Why does it even matter? Somebody took my picture and shared it without my permission. I'm gonna go call my dad. Um... Thanks for sitting with me. Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord. Honey, did Chad take these photos? No, I don't know who did it. Okay, well I'm literally rushing to check out of the hotel now and head home. No, you don't need to rush home but can you call the school? I can't go back there. Yeah, I'll take care of it. Okay, thanks. - We'll figure this out, sweetheart. I love you. Be safe and you remember you call me if anything else happens, okay? Okay. I'll see you Thursday. Are you kidding me? What's with all the victim shaming? Yes you are. This day fucking blows. - Hey. - Hey. Come in. - You all right? - No, I'm mortified. I can never show my face there again. We could get you a mask. - You're not helping. - Sorry. Just trying to lighten up the mood. I, um... - got your homework. - Thanks. What did your dad say? Honestly, it was like an interrogation. Really? Yeah. It seems like everybody's pointing the finger at me. It's not like I asked for this. Who's pointing the finger at you, Clara? Just stop, okay? It's it's fine..just..I want to be alone! All right, then I'll go. Deja wait, wait come back. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have yelled at you. It's okay, I get it. I would want to be alone after a day like today. Thank you for bringing me my homework. No problem. You still want me to come with you tomorrow to pick up your car? - Of course. - All right. - See you later. - I'll see you tomorrow. Looks like it's just you and me again tonight, Fish. Hello? Is anybody there? Whatever. What the hell? I thought you were here to kill me. What the hell happened? I woke up in that was in my floor. Is that blood, who did this? I don't know. We should call the cops. Eden 911, what's your location? Hi, this is Deja Parker, I'm at 1975 Hallow Drive, um, someone has... You think it was a prank? No, I don't. All right, ladies, it looks like everything's clear in there. If you guys have anything else you'd like to add, just feel free to call down to the station. - Um... okay? - All right. Thank you. Bye. Seriously, that didn't make me feel any better. I thought they would've had the whole team out here searching for fingerprints. I guess that just happens on TV. Are you gonna call your dad? There's no point. He'll probably just think it was a prank just like the stupid cops. I guess, but don't you think it's weird it said Jezebel like your email? You sure you didn't attract a stalker? That's not possible, how would they find me? I don't know. What are they doing here? Hey, Mrs. Roberts. Jacob. Hello, Clara dear. Just coming by to check on you. You know, after yesterday. Oh yeah... uh, thanks... We were actually just leaving. We need to go pick up Clara's car and our Uber will be here any moment. Oh, we can take you guys, right mama? Of course, I'd love to. We really wouldn't wanna take up too much of your time, but thank you so much. Nonsense, we're already here. - Oh, okay. Uh... Sure.

I just wanna get my car and go. I got this. Are you serious? Why are you so lame, Chad? Why you got to be such a bitch, Deja? At least I don't pretend to get action. Guys, just stop! I wanna get my car and go. Pfft! What car? Oh, hey Mom, Clara forgot her phone. I'm gonna go bring it to her. I'll be back in a minute. Clara, you forgot your phone in the car. Wow. So you dating this Jesus freak now? You really move on to dick fast, huh? What is wrong with you? Thank you, Jacob. Um... Do you guys have a bathroom? Yeah, it's along the side of the building. The bathroom isn't on the side of the building. - I know - You're so mean. And you're such a skank. Micah, can I get those keys before I end up with an assault charge? Yeah. You just need to sign right here. Let's see, James Burke, Christopher Wilson, Misty Bowles, Clara Banks... sign right there and you'll be good to go. Hey, you okay? Yeah. I tripped on the way back here. Hon, you got something on your shirt. - Can we just go? - Yeah. I know... Why would he call me that? I don't understand! It's 5:30. This is Tim chase. The Eden Police Department is investigating the second murder to occur within the last seven days. A spokesperson for the department said, it's the first time in 22 years that back-to-back murders have occurred. Now they state there's no cause to think the murders are in any way related? Well, we'll just have to take their word on that, but keep your doors locked tonight, Eden. Be safe. Let's lighten things back up now. Continuing their run in the number one Billboard spot, it's Sabell with the song... Maybe that psycho will get Chad next. I wish. He's such a dick. I can't believe I dated him. He was just foul back there. Speaking of foul, it smells like something died in here. Well, that didn't help, now it smells like death and flowers. Just my freaking luck. Can this day get any worse? Forget that jerk, he isn't worth it and he definitely isn't worth our lives. Slow down, speedy. Uh... Dej? Clara, slow down. - I can't! - What?!? The brakes aren't working! Deja, what do I do? Nothing is working! I don't know, I don't know! Oh my God, we're going to hit them! Clara, we're going to hit the pole! Oh my God, Oh my God! Mom? we were just in an accident. We're at Old Blair road... Old Alabama/Blair road... Okay. Clara? My Mom is coming. - Clara? - Okay. Um... I just need to get my purse. What's wrong? Oh my God... what? What's that? So Ms. Banks, can you think of anyone that would wanna hurt you? No, I get along with most people. Most people. I mean recently my boyfriend Chad, and I broke up and he did send me a text saying that I would regret it. What? Is this the same Chad that works at the garage that recently worked on your vehicle? Yes. You didn't think to tell me about that? Dad... it's fine. Okay. Well, Ms. Banks, I think that's all we need for now. No, it's not. You're gonna go arrest this guy, aren't you? Mr. Banks first, we have to question everyone involved to further our investigation. He tried to kill my baby girl! Do you understand that? Mr. Banks though I do understand your anger, please understand that we have to review all of the evidence. Yeah. Clara, are you ready? - Let's go. - Okay. If you ever come near my daughter again, - and I swear to God- - Get your hands- Hey! Hey! Hey! I cannot believe this... Enough! Get in there! Get in there! Have a seat. Do you even know why you were brought in today? I don't know. Maybe because my ex is a bitch that whines over stupid shit. You think what happened was stupid? Yeah, since when was dog shit on fire and a mouse prank warrant an interrogation? Chad shut your mouth. Listen, if you wanna charge my son with anything, you can speak with our lawyer. Sir, we are questioning everyone that came in contact with Ms. Banks vehicle. We're not charging your son with anything, yet. But if you feel you need a lawyer, no one's stopping you. Are we done? I have another question. Chad, did you cut Clara's brake lines? - What? No. Dad I swear- - Son I know. Are we done yet? I have what I need at the moment. Then we're leaving. Chad let's go. Mr. Michaels, don't leave town. I might still need some more information. I cannot believe that the day is almost over. You want me to make you something to eat? No, I'm just gonna go up to my room. Clara, you know you can talk to me, right? I know. I miss you mom... I really need you right now. I feel bad for the kid. Feel bad for whom? I feel bad for Clara, of course. Why? Well, she must be scared. Accidents are always scary. We should add her to our prayer list. I'll pray she stays away from my husband. I'm sorry, what was that hon? I was agreeing with you. Well, I'll be back in a few hours. Where are you going? Uh... Bowling with the boys. Bowling, I thought that was on Friday. With Halloween being on Friday this year, we just thought we'd just go ahead and go tonight. Oh, okay. Are... are you okay? I can stay home if you'd like. No, go have fun. Tell the boys said hi. Okay Oh, let's pray for Clara. Yeah Clara must've been so scared! Poor Clara, there's nothing poor about that husband stealing witch. He never changes bowling night, what am I thinking? He's probably meeting up with her right now. Huh..Jezebel and Clara have a lot in common. Both are harlots. But Jezebel fell and one day Clara will too. Everything unholy will come to light. Clara? What are you doing here? I think you know. No, I don't. We're supposed to meet at the church tomorrow. My sweet Bett... my plans are not with you. Is your husband home? You stay away from my husband. I think I've been more than patient with you. Funny you say patient, we played doctor just the other day. What's wrong with you? Wrong? Nothing's wrong. It felt so right. You bitch! Stay away from my family, You stay away from my husband! You are nothing but a harlot of Babylon. Um... Mom, who are you talking to? - Clara is here. - No, she's not. But she's right, no, no... she... She's was right here! I... uh... No... she was right here! My God... I.. Do you want me to help you walk you to bed? No. I'm fine, it's... um... It's okay. Goodnight. Don't get too close to Clara, son. She's a weed in God's garden. - Hey guys? - Oh my God, Clara. I am so happy you're not dead! Me too. Oh man, I was so worried about you. Feel better? Yeah - Seriously... can you learn how to drive? What is he doing here? Mr. Green, I'm so glad you're here. Well, we shouldn't be here too long today. We'd like to put up most of the decorations right before the event starts, but things like the banners we like to put up the day before. Jacob, can you help me with that ladder? Okay. You can join the rest of the group. I'm sure you already know everybody. - Hey. - Hey Micah. Hey..um... Deja, can I talk to you for a minute? You can say whatever you want right here. Okay... umm... I..uh... wanted to say I was sorry. I shouldn't have messed with your grades like that. - What?!? - He said he was sorry. And?!? So... you wanna tell me how you did that? Because my grades could use a little bit of a pick-me-up, if you know what I'm saying... - I... um... - Don't worry. I'm not trying to hit on you. You're not my type. Don't take it personal, no man's her type. That's true. Hey everyone, well, here's the banners that we'll be painting. Once you get that done, we can hang it up above the entrance, okay? I have some stuff to do inside, so if you need anything, just ask Jacob. - Is this paint? - Yeah... Wow. Great job guys, it looks really good. You have paint on your shirt, Kimmy. Oh man, this is my favorite jacket. I can get that out for you. No, it's fine. It's just a jacket. No, I insist. Especially with all your help today, I'll take care of it. Good job guys. - We did a really good job. - Yeah we did. What do you think, Kimmy? Earth to Kimmy, you with us? No, you guys are really boring. Did you hear about this guy who got murdered? There were two murders, and isn't that the one that was on the news? Yeah, actually it was behind your house Jacob. It was probably the guy who broke into our shed. He stole a shovel and a couple of tools. Looks like Karma got him. Wow, you're the last person I expected to hear that from, aren't you supposed to be all turn the other cheek? Back in biblical times, you could kill a thief if you caught them in the act. That's a little harsh. So are we gonna to put this banner up? Or what? - what is this? - Jack O'lantern pancakes! It looks like a deranged clown. Well let's hope that these deranged clowns at least taste good. - I love you, dad. - I love you too. So... uh... the sheriff was here this morning and they're still looking into trying to figure out, I guess, who was all involved in that accident, but, the stay away order has been placed on Chad. So he's not gonna be bothering you again. Thank you. I gotta protect my baby. All right, so listen, after we get done with breakfast, I was thinking... maybe we can carve our pumpkins and keep those demons away. Honestly, that would be nice. These are pretty good. Not bad for deranged clowns, right? Right. "Ichabod" by Ok Otter Where is she? Eden Tennessee has been plagued by several, mysterious murders. unfortunately, as of right now, the police are unable to determine who is the culprit. Come on! Approximately 10 PM last night ...residents of the windward area reported a disturbance that witnesses described... She better not be ditching us. Screams and cries for help. When investigators arrived on the scene, they were unable to determine the cause of the disturbance. Trick or treat! - What do you say? - Thank you. 'Cause the devil might get you! Rawr! Man, I miss the good old days. Good old days? Yeah. You know, when people used to go door to door. Mom says this is much safer. I guess. You wanna see me die... don't you? You wanna watch me bleed. What? Uh... Hey! We're out of candy. I... um... I'll be right there. Mrs. Roberts, we were wondering if we could go see Kimmy? Yeah. It's fine, thanks for your help. Where are they going? To check on Kimmy. Is she okay? Well, she's supposed to be here today and they still haven't heard from her. I can stop at Clara's later and check in on her, okay? Oh, Hey Micah, can you pack this up in the van for me? Sure. Hey, thanks for your help today. No problem. What the hell? Shit! Dude. Didn't mean to scare you, mom wanted to know if you needed a ride. No, I'm okay. Are you sure? Yeah... I uh, I think I'll walk. It's nice night for a walk. I can't believe Kimmy ditched us. She probably didn't wanna be caught dead in this angel costume. I guess... You sure you don't want to go to the party with me? Yeah, I think I'll just stay home. All right. I'll head out then. Okay. Be safe. I will. Call me if you change your mind. I will. Dad, are you home? I guess those masks are popular this year. Aren't you a little too old to be trick or treating? You know what? It's whatever, we have candy left anyway. Oh, ha ha. You're so scary. Just take the candy and go. Let go of me, what are you doing? Let go of... Please don't... WHY?! Okay, you're all set now. When you get to the hospital, you are gonna have to have stitches, okay? Okay. Here you go, sweetie. This is to help you, okay? Until you get to the hospital. They will get you another. Alright? Okay. Why are you here, Micah? I found something in the back of Mrs. Roberts' van... there were photos of you. I thought you should know about it. Were you the one that knocked on my door? No, I was on your front step and I rang the doorbell. And next thing I know there's a pain in the back of my head, and I woke up in the bush. I would have never thought Mrs. Roberts was... violent. For WGET, I'm Tim Chase. Authorities this morning are investigating a horrific scene that occurred late last night on Hallow Drive. An Eden police departments spokesperson said 18-year-old Clara Banks of Eden, Tennessee was attacked by Betty Roberts, 42, also of Eden. Ms. Banks suffered multiple stab wounds, but was able to fend off her attacker, which led to the death of Roberts. Betty Roberts had no prior arrest record nor history of violence, but sources tell us she is now the prime suspect in two murders that occurred earlier this week in Eden. In a related story, authorities are beginning a search this morning for Kimmy Nichols. Nichols, 20 of Eden, went missing the day before Halloween. Nichols is a close friend of Clara Banks and attends Oak Ridge state college. So tox screening analysis of Mrs. Roberts revealed that she'd been given the wrong medication... resulting in severe side effects. After looking at the deceased' computer we found emails sent to your daughter's email address. It seems Mrs. Roberts had been fixated on you for some time, probably the result of the medication. Side effects included paranoia, hallucination, agitation... - Do you have a date tonight? - No, no, no... - Maybe I do have a date. - That's cute. Yeah. Carmel... You okay? Mmm hmm... Clara, what's wrong? Clara?!? What's wrong? Clara? Someone call 911 now! Oh my God... Clara! Somebody call an ambulance now! Call 911!!! Clara! - Clara?!? Clara! - Is she okay? Call 911! Clara! Oh my goodness. What's happening? Looks like angels. Angels... Hey hon, dinner's ready. Hey Jacob, could you could you come help me Stop barking. Hon, you got something on your shirt The brakes aren't working!
