ONE-WAY TO MOSCOW Zurich, October 19, 1989 That was revolution music from Cuba. You're listening to Radio LoRa. And now the news. After Erich Honegger's resignation in the GDR yesterday, Michael Gorbachev continues to urge for reforms. Hope remains that the militarists in our country will hear this call from Moscow. On November 26th, Switzerland will vote on the abolition of the army. Tonight the new play by Max Frisch will premiere at the Schauspielhaus in Zurich. Damn. Sorry! Amateurs. No to the army! Yes to reason! Got it? No. Hold on. I'll be right back. - Hey you, cop! - The police? You can see it right away. Amateurs. And now further news of the day. Berne. The latest report by the Security Commission of the National Council states that the Warsaw Pact continues to pose a considerable potential threat. Zurich. The Group for a Switzerland Without an Army held an unauthorized demonstration outside of the Schauspielhaus. This was prompted by the premiere of Max Frisch's latest play "Jonas and His Veteran", The controversial performance has been condemned by the conservatives as pure referendum propaganda. Is that bad? No. If it doesn't bother you that Switzerland is attacked. It's subversion in its purest form! A textbook maneuver! Our direct democracy is being instrumentalised to fight our own army. This is more than theatre! Someone's pointing a weapon at you. You're staring down the barrel. And you don't even notice. Let's go back. To Moscow. To Moscow. To Moscow. To Moscow! Excuse me... Good morning. What's this? I looked into this matter at the theatre again... You're right! They are... Everything's connected. Carl Heymann, German director. Staunch socialist, a regular in the GDR. Here with Margot Piszek, Polish. The one distributing the leaflets. Also works at the theatre, costume design. And familiar with that Odile Jola. And here: Bachmann, Claude, an old acquaintance of ours, left-wing journalist. Alternative local radio, works at the theatre too. And you collected all this last night? Yes. The response from Berne is still pending. What do you think? Me? Looks interesting... at first glance. All right. Your dossier. What? But... You're going home to sleep. Do you know how much overtime you've accumulated? That's no problem for me, really. Maybe not for you! I've got human resources on my back. You're going on holiday! I don't want to see you here until Christmas. Schuler! Yes? The door. Good work. Thank you. But you missed the most important part. Last page. At the bottom. EXTRAS WANTED The front door is guarded but the back door is open. That's our way in. An inside job? Quick. Good. But will we get it approved? Not likely. Too dangerous! Too expensive! And we're not trained either! By the time we cut the red tape, the battle will be lost. Luckily for us, there are informants! The professors who tell us about their students. All those janitors and landlords. Yes. I just don't understand... Who will infiltrate the theatre? - Well... you! - Me? I can't stop you from acting in your spare time. If you want to be an extra... You're on holiday after all! Won't that be a bit conspicuous? I'd have to go on stage, in front of everyone... You'll be standing in the back with a dozen others. What will you tell your children when they ask: "What did you do when Switzerland was attacked? Why did you allow that to happen?" But if you don't think you can do it... It's just... Well... according to the regulations... Well then, fine. Maybe it was a bad idea. Have a nice holiday. But from here I could... We have so much to do. I have no other plans... Get yourself a life! Take your shoes off! Busy at work? It's okay. My goodness, you're exhausted. My cousin was a police officer too. By 45, he had lost all his hair due to stress. In the Thurgau. - I'm actually on vacation. - Great! Where are you going? You can't work all the time. You have to be able to face yourself next morning. I thought... maybe we could meet up? Oh, you know... I've met someone. Ah... that's great. Hamburger without pickles, right? I'll add some crap they'd read. Otto F. Walter, Peter Bichsel, Franz Hohler. Here, a complete robber costume. Give me your trousers too. Take them off! Or do you think they wear creases? Every detail is crucial, Schuler! No risk. Your legend. Read it. Memorize it. Destroy it. What if my cover gets blown? I've known you since you were little. You're sharp as a tack. You're single. You're completely exchangeable. You're entirely forgettable. You're the born insider. I'm Walo Hubacher. I'm a seaman. I started in Basel as a ship's boy and as an ordinary seaman and then I went to Rotterdam as an able seaman. My parents are living overseas. Able seaman... Until recently in Rotterdam and now... an extra. Hi, I'm Walo. Hi, I'm Walo. I'm Walo. STAGE ENTRY Hello. Hubacher. Reporting for reading rehearsal. Hi. I'm Walo. I have an appointment. - Your first time? - Yes. I'm a seaman, really. I started in Rotterdam. My parents live in... Just down the passage. - Do I need to get changed? - For the reading rehearsal? Hi. I'm Walo. Hi. I'm Reto. - Officers? - Yes. There. And the others? Which others? The other extras. You two are the only ones, like in the play. Now! Could we have some quiet please? Dear team of artists, dear ensemble, dear participants. Director Carl Heymann is a dear guest at our house. A warm welcome! This is now his, I think, fifth... - The sixth. - Sixth work in Zurich already. Well... Time passes. But this time will be very special. A project close to both our hearts. Your first Shakespeare here with us. Yes, well... I'm just about through with Brecht... You'll find Shakespeare's a class warrior too. I very much look forward to this work with this wonderful cast and wish you all a good start. Sorry! I totally overslept. - Hello, director. - Hi. Sorry, won't happen again! Promise. Well, we're complete now. - Over to you. - Thank you, my dear. - Where are we? - In Illyria. Who are those two? Extras. Could you... would you please join us at the table? Come! Just sit at the table with us. Over there. There. Hi. Hi. Thank you. To make this clear right away: With me everyone's always equally important. There's no top, no bottom. Only cooperation. You are the two officers who arrest Antonio. You are the arm of the authoritarian state. So to speak the lever with which the capital specifically reaches into reality, and that's enormously important. That's why we've let you keep the text even though you're "only" extras. Text? Yes. We have... Look, here. We'll read. I won't interrupt, I'll comment afterwards... Let's feel the effect of the text first. Gabi, will you read the stage directions please? 1st act, 1st scene. Music. Orsino, Duke of Illyria, Curio and other lords come on stage. If music be the food of love, play on. Give m... This play's always staged purely as a comedy. Which is absolutely... For me it's important... to distil the political attitudes from the play. Will you read from the beginning again? If music be the food of love, play on. Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting, the appetite may sicken, and... Do you get it? Orsino's country is called Illyria. That sounds a little like "illusion", but I mean illusion in a positive sense. Illusion as a utopia The appetite... But also in a subversive sense. It's the country of music, poetry, intoxication, of the sex obsessed and of idealists. It's the country of anarchists. Shit! Sorry. It's okay. Does anyone have a tissue? Well then, here's our first dramatic climax. - I'm such a klutz. - Not much harm done, really. Have I seen you before? - Are you here for the first time? - Yes. Stay a moment after the rehearsal. I need to measure you for your costume. - May we start? - Yes, yes. Right. Um... Where were we? In Illyria. When is he going over? Right after the spy's exposed. I'll easily get everything through the Iron Curtain. They're creating a PIC in Berne now... - I played Puck in Dortmund once. - No! PIC, Parliamentary Investigatory Commission. Ah, I see. Did you see Cincera yesterday? They're still surveilling everything, I swear. Tapping phones. Everything. You're paranoid, Küde! But it's the paranoids who get caught first. They're collaborating with the CIA now. You wait and see. And you? Me? I don't really have an opinion on that. - What will you have to drink? - Sparkling water, please. Beautiful! Great! Inhale, exhale. Slowly get up! Yes. Come on! And move to the music. Just the way you feel. What you feel! Just move. That's great. Move! You can make noises if you want. Now slowly everyone finds a partner. So that you don't dance alone, find a partner. The prerequisite for any kind of playing is trust! Do you understand? Nothing works without trust. Okay. Now we'll do an improvisation. Everyone chooses their own animal now. I want to see animals! Yes, beautiful! Slowly the animals make contact with one another. I'm a snake. What are you? A dog, I guess. Yes! That's good too! Not just mammals. Continue! I'll be right back. You're animals! - Yes. Thank you. - Don't get caught. Marogg. Operation Curtain, reporting. - What is it? - It's a catastrophe. There are only two extras. One other and me... It's difficult. They are... Well, Heymann is clearly involved. Something's going on with the theatre director. And there was a handover with a third party, unidentified as yet. Schuler! Slow down. What's the matter with you? Start again. Yes. So first they handed out the texts. In addition to Shakespeare also political theories. Right from the start: Adorno, Gramsci, Agamben, Marx. Belch and Aguecheek claim it's for dramaturgy and that nobody reads it but... Stop! Belch? Aguecheek? Countries of origin? No! Those are the names of their parts. But they are friends with Margot. Is that a part too? No, she's real. She's the costume designer. That's the one who... Schuler! Stop it! It's the middle of the night! Now get a grip and go to sleep! This can wait. Submit your next report in writing. Regular channels. This channel here is only for emergencies. Got it. I'm sorry. Good night. Antonio, I arrest you in the name of the Duke. - Good morning. - Good morning. Hey, you! Yes? I have a question. - You said you're a seaman. - Yes... For a long time? Why do you ask? I'm interested. Well, I started in Basel, at the Rhine Harbour as a ship's boy and... Can you recommend it? Sailor? - Yes, I suppose. - Doesn't it get a bit lonely? It's all right. I do a bit of radio. I wanted to be a teacher but... somehow I can't seem to get a job. Have a nice day! Yes, you too. And? The Schauspielhaus? We're waiting for the German report on the director. The others have been recorded and are registered centrally. - And what about that Odile Jola? - Why? Because the Federal Prosecutor's Office called me in a flap to ask why we had registered her. Maybe she's one of their informants? - Heymann was looking for you. - Really? He just wants to lay you. Nonsense! We're working on a project together. A great project! Let me guess. You're naked and he's lying under you. Can I do the costumes? Kidding! There's no costume. You're so dumb. He's planning a political action. He doesn't want anyone here to know. - I wonder why. - Now stop it! Seriously! We're doing something highly sensitive here. He said we can do whatever we want. They'll all be there: military, businessmen. They'll be off guard. Come on, you don't believe that. Looking for something? They need to take my measurements for the costume. I should have come yesterday... Listen, make a real cop out of him. Straw shield, helmet and all that shit, yeah? - Startlet, they've given us the go-ahead. - Really? Hands up! Sit down. The political stance in the theatre is generally taken to range from left to left radical. I am one who dares all for love. Even death. However, most actors seem rather superficially interested in political questions. Am I still in the light here? The lead on a possible tunnel under the Berlin Wall turned out to be false since the Iron Curtain referred to fire protection on stage. The frequently mentioned Russian Stanislawski can also be ruled out as an intermediary in Moscow. He should rather be placed in a milieu-specific context. AN ACTOR'S WORK Cafeteria cook KurtMesserli has a distorted perception of bourgeois order. His ideas tend towards the paranoid delusional. In 10 years everyone will have a phone like this. They'll know everything then. Friends. Hobbies. Big Brother is watching you. You'll see. He's harmless in his delusions. Margot Piszek likes to have a beer in the evenings. The actress, Odile Jola, is... interesting. Director Heymann has a clear potential for danger. What are you doing here? Nothing. Look at you! - I thought you were on vacation. - Yes, I am. These are holiday photos. That's private... A secret investigation? I can't talk about it. She's cute, isn't she? But you do know whose dossier this is? Talk to the boss. And what if you get caught? Do you think he'll cover for you? Do you think he'd risk his neck? He'll drop you like a hot potato. Hey, Schuler! I'm only trying to help you. Do you even know who you're watching? I'll come in in a moment, okay? Hi! Good morning. Are you coming to the theatre? That's a change. I couldn't reach you on the phone. Has something happened? You tell me! - You're putting yourself in danger. - What? You know what I'm talking about. But you don't know who you're involved with. Dad, I have no idea what you're talking about. There's an entry on you. On me? - Where? - No, not where, but why! That's the important question. What company are you keeping that this happened? How does it look if I don't even have my own daughter under control? Art... Art is one thing. But political conspiracy is something different. I can't just sit back and watch. Political conspiracy? What's going on? Dad, who makes an entry about me? - What are you up to with the director? - I am an actress! Yes! I know you don't like to be reminded but I work with directors! All night long? The man has a child in Vienna and one in Leipzig. And he's married too! What do you think he's after with you? - Why do you know all that? - I just want to help you. I shouldn't be telling you any of this. I really don't need that kind of help! Take care of yourself! And Mom sends her love. Hi. - Is this becoming a habit? - Sorry. I was held up. Listen, we had some thoughts about the costume... Yes? Mr. Heymann wants Olivia to be naked in this scene. Naked? With a veil, of course. - Naked, but with a veil? - Yes, with a veil. I'm completely naked and then have a veil here? No! Cesario's the first man who doesn't immediately succumb to your charms. He's interested in your inner self. He wants to see the face behind the veil. You reveal everything, in all your splendour and beauty. But your inner being, your face remains veiled. - Do you understand? - No. - Then act without understanding it. - Sorry, it doesn't make any sense. Olivia is in mourning, why would she be naked? You always say you want to go to extremes, want to take risks! You want to be brave! And now you chicken out! What's your problem? Is he serious? What? Nothing. Tell me! Please! We very much want to hear your opinion! Maybe we can learn something. I don't know about... Oh! You don't know? - I think... - What do you think? I think if someone doesn't want to undress, they shouldn't be forced to. On your knees! Yes. Sit up and beg. Yes! This is a good image. Dog 1, you lie on the floor and lick her feet. Waldi! Forepaws stretched out. And now text! What's the text? Tell me! - Good madam. - Good madam! Let me see your face. Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my face? You are now out of your text. But we will draw the curtain and show you the picture. Look you, sir, such a one I was this present. Waldi! Sniff her a little! You're a dog! Come, come! Come on! Excellently done, if God did all. 'Tis in grain, sir... And... Stop that shit! What's the matter with you? Fucking tits and ass theatre! I won't do it! Yes... well... We've cracked that scene. Next scene! Orsino! We should be able to do something about this guy. Maybe through the aliens' police? - Withdraw his work permit? - And on what grounds? Infiltration? Planning a secret action? And then? Send him home. Deportation. Seriously... Do you really think Heymann is an enemy agent? Probably not. But I do. There is no Odile Jola. - What? - It's an alias, a stage name. Her real name is Lehmann. She's Colonel Lehmann's daughter. How did we get into the Schauspielhaus? The front gate was closed, but... Through the back door. Our enemy does the exact same thing! Tactical basics. Moscow gains access to the Justice Department. They want to get to Lehmann. His daughter's only a means to an end. Do you think the Warsaw Pact will dissolve peacefully? Nothing's more dangerous than an injured predator. For people like Heymann it's about all or nothing. The dissolution of the West has only just begun! Then shouldn't we bug his hotel room? We can't even get permission to tap a telephone! And if something does happen and we didn't intervene? It took the RAF terrorists before the German Intelligence Service got more leeway. Maybe we need a bang as well for those up there to understand. So, now the arrest. Now the mask falls. It's the central motive of the play. Officers! It's up to you now. You gotta take the spy down hard! - Can we? - Yes. Go! Enter Antonio! Put up your sword! I take the fault on me. Nay, if you be anundertaker, I am for you. O good Sir Toby, hold! Here come the officers! Antonio, I arrest you in the name of the Duke. What was that? You're arresting him, right? Don't be so meek! Um... just imagine... You are a policeman. Got it. Antonio! I arrest you in the name of the Duke. - Great. - See, it works. Carl! I'm sorry. I have to interrupt. You won't believe this! - The Berlin Wall is falling. - What? This is definitely a historic moment: 28 years after the wall was built it can now be crossed again. Turn up the volume! That's the end of the Cold War. Look at the Trabants. My cousin waited 5 years for one of those tin cans. The CIA won't be happy. Who will be their enemy now? It goes perfectly with the play. We have longed and hoped for this day since the Wall was built on August 13, 1961. We Germans are now the happiest of people. My goodness! Plans change! I's right in this situation. Oh, come on! What do you want to do? Lay everything to waste? No! But I thought we'd do something they'd remember. Everyone will remember you. Don't worry. You're not taking me seriously. I'm not worried! Come here. Everything will be fine. My starlet. You're a bombshell! Shit. Bye. See you. Seriously? Yeah, so bye! Bye... 28 years ago, the wall was built. Hey, sailor! Do you think everything will change now? Yes, I think so. And? How do you like the theatre? Yes... it's interesting to see. The dissolution of the GDR is probably hard for Heymann. Why? Doesn't he have bonds somehow? I mean, ideologically. Him? I thought he was a director. But do you know what he really is? Should I tell you? Heymann is actually... ...a coward! You know what he does with his salary? He puts it in a plastic bag with Karl Marx on it and secretly takes it to his private banker so that he doesn't have to pay any taxes. Guess why he likes to work in Switzerland so much? And listen, that's not all. Imagine, the theatre money isn't enough for him. Now he wants the money from the bank, too. A robbery? He's staging something for his banker friend. The great political agitator Heymann is staging a show for a guild evening! Seriously? Nobody can be bought as easily as him. And what's your job in this? I'm stupid little Odile who thought it was about art. Küde! I need more wine! We're closing! You can't be serious. I really can't take it anymore! "Starlet, you're a bombshell!" "We'll hold a mirror up to them. Radical!" And I believed it. The only time Heymann is truly radical is during his pay negotiations. And when I have to show my breasts on stage. Maybe I should perform naked at the guild evening. At least they'll know who directed it. I thought you were planning something dangerous. Me too. - Can you hold this for a moment? - Yeah, sure. I need a drink. Where are we going? Don't you think you've had enough? - Come on, I'll take you home. - Oh, you're one of those. You'll take me home? - Excuse me. - No, I just meant... Can I ask you two a quick question? Yeah. Can you tell our listeners what it's like to be an artist now that the Wall's gone? That's a very personal question. And you? Well, the Eastern bloc as we know it no longer exists. A central threat potential is thus eliminated. Soviet communism is losing its importance, but this will probably give the Western European socialist parties a boost. And of course it'll make things more difficult for the Swiss army in the forthcoming referendum. Off the top of my head I'd say... Yes. - Have a nice evening. - Bye! - Are you a politician? - No, no... I'm just interested. You? - What do you want to know? - Everything. - Did you always want to be an actress? - Actually, yes. And why? It's just nice to be someone else sometimes. It's so exhausting to be yourself all the time. And your parents? My parents? You said I could ask. All right... My mother starts drinking in the morning and my father is nuts. He's having me watched now. That's the latest thing. He knows everything. There's probably a spy here right now listening to every word. - I can hardly imagine that. - You don't know my father. Never mind... My real family is the theatre anyway. But sometimes I feel like I don't have a life outside my job. I know the feeling. What? You're special somehow. Nobody's ever said that to me before. - Come on, we'll take a boat. - What? Come on! Wait! So, how do we get to the sea? Anchors aweigh! All aboard! Hey! Move those stupid Alps away! We want to go to the sea! Bye Zurich! Ship ahoy! There... This is where I live. Do you want to come up? Another time. Well then... Good night. Sweet dreams. You too. It's 09:30 and of course we are talking about the fall of the Berlin Wall. I have an interesting statement from the Zurich Schauspielhaus. Well, the Eastern bloc as we know it no longer exists. A central threat potential is thus eliminated. Soviet communism is losing its importance, but this will probably give the Western European socialist parties a boost. And of course it'll make things more difficult for the Swiss army in the forthcoming referendum. Could you explain this? I only meant... With everything that's happened. In Poland, in Hungary, with Gorbachev. The Wall came down yesterday and I thought... Ah, you thought? Doesn't look like it! Has the fifth column infiltrated our own ranks now? That's LoRa... Nobody listens to them. You're reeking of alcohol. People there are drinking all the time. I can't only drink water, I'd draw attention. You draw attention by babbling on the radio! Hans! I'm sure you heard what's happening in Berne. Yes. A little. Why did Mrs. Kopp resign from the Federal Council? Because she shared secrets with her husband. Because he's involved in some illicit funds... She was forced to resign through a coordinated, hysterical campaign headed by the left-wing media. Ranging from the Beobachter, the Weltwoche, to the Swiss national TV and radio. The question is: why? As I said. Because she shared... So that her resignation can be investigated! Do you understand? No. Not quite. Moritz Leuenberger. Is he familiar to you? National Councillor. Social Democrat. He's been trying to undermine the work of state security for years. As a member of the Control Committee he learned that the Federal Prosecutor's Office collects data. About him too. But he can't get at these data. He'd need a Parliamentary Investigatory Commission. A PIC! But he can only get it through the Kopp case. Leuenberger is about to get access to about one million dossiers, including direct references to partner services, Canton, city police. Anyway, most of the data is outdated. It's only dicey when data was collected outside the legally defined mandate. That's where you come in. Are you aware that insider missions may only be carried out on behalf of the public prosecutor? Your activities will be reviewed. No question. Until then, you will be suspended from duty. If I may offer you some advice: get a lawyer. What? He said... Vacation, I said. I reported regularly. Awkward situation, isn't it? By the way, what do you think of my daughter? What? She's an adult. She'll have to bear the consequences. But it's not easy to watch as a father. She's still my child. She's planning something. For my guild's dinner. You'll be there to? What do you know? Nothing specific. I mean, no details. You have access to my daughter. If you can ensure she doesn't cause a scene we may be able to help you too. Schuler... I almost didn't recognize you. - You look good without a moustache. - Thank you. My cousin did that too once. New hairstyle, suddenly holes in his pants, reading strange books. Changed completely from one day to the next. But then he ended up in a psychiatric ward. - Really? - Hamburger without pickles? No, just coffee. Thanks. You dog! Can I help you? It's all right. He's a colleague. We work together. But not in uniform, right? Oh yes. I'm an officer. - With that hair? - I recently saw one in Basel. He was in underwear. The whole time. It was a hit. As long as you can face yourself the next morning... Yes... Listen, we have to go. See you soon. - Hi. - Hi. Am I interrupting? It's all right. Sleep well? I drank too much yesterday. Yeah. Me too. About the performance you told me about. Do you know what you want to do? Why? Do you have an idea? No. I just thought... Hey, lovebirds. Time to work! - Do you know Antonio's text? - Me? Recite Antonio's text. Well... um... Reto says: "This is the man; do thy office." I say: "Antonio, I arrest you in the name of the Duke." Then Antonio says: "You do mistake me, sir." Then Reto says: "No, sir, no jot; I know your favour well. Though now you have no sea-cap on your head. Take him away." Then Antonio says: "I must obey." Congratulations. You're Antonio. Yes... What? No! - My dears! - Now! Your colleague broke a leg while drunk. We've re-cast. - The... His name? - Walo. Walo will play Antonio. Cheaper than an actor. I've been an extra for longer, Mr. Heymann. Wouldn't it be more appropriate for me to play... Quiet! Who will play the other officer? - Pardon? - The other officer? Me! At the premiere and then some other extra. I don't care. Hold on. Margot? We need a new costume for our new Antonio. A spy has only one single goal: To attract no attention at all. He must be the epitome of normal. Not bad. Wait. You look stunning. I think it's awful. It's way too tight. What? You still remind me of someone. It'll be fantastic. Easy for you to say. You don't have to go out there. You don't know those people. What do you want? To scare your dad? That's childish. That's exactly what they expect from us! To cause a scandal. To shit on their carpet. We have to play with that expectation, you see. We have to deliberately undermine it. They think there'll be a huge explosion. And we'll be very quiet. Starlet... You're a bombshell. What? You look hilarious. - You think so? - Yeah. Like a ticket inspector. The moustache is great! Totally bourgeois. Crazy! You're really versatile. I sometimes wish I were as brave as you. I'm not brave at all. Yes, you are. You'll perform in front of hundreds of strangers although you've never acted before. You do it. Simply because you feel like it. That's incredibly brave. I always merely do what others ask of me. Like a puppet. What if you just don't do it? If you just don't go? I think you have a problem with authority. Of course there are directives, but maybe sometimes they're simply wrong. You can't just blindly execute every command. You have to be able to face yourself... the next morning. In Pruntrut in the Jura An innkeeper has a house A girl looks out the window three times every hour And if you ask the soldiers who the girl might be The heart and leg of every Swiss lad will be lifted She is little Gilberte Gilberte from Courgenay She knows 300,000 soldiers and all the officers She is little Gilberte Gilberte from Courgenay She's known throughout Switzerland and in the army Be it trumpeter, be it drummer Be it simple soldier She has him on a string From corporal to lieutenant to major Who has everyone by the tail and by the ear? We worked best when nobody knew that we were there. Congratulations. Good work. You'll be back on duty on Monday. And Operation Curtain? Called off! Don't you think it worth staying a little longer? - Now that I'm in. - What? I think I should really do some more research. Seriously! I've got a hot lead there. Nonsense! Things turned out well. Thank you. I would like to say something. Thank you for letting me sing this song for you. Thank you, Mr. Winter, for the invitation. Thank you, Mr. Heymann, for suggesting me. It's a soldier's song. My own father is a soldier. Hi Daddy! Hello, Odile. So I know what it means. And I also know that it's not an easy time for him. For all the brave men in our military. Especially when the army is so directly attacked! Sometimes I wonder what these people think! What kind of people are seriously against our Swiss army? Are they even Swiss? It's like handing the robber the keys to the house. Yes! Abolishing the army means abolishing Switzerland! No less! Bravo! Let them go to Moscow if they don't like it here! One-way to Moscow, all of them! Yes! Though... Let's be honest. Even the train ticket would be a waste of money. We have a beautiful football stadium in Zurich. It'd be a good place to gather the lot of them. Bravo! We know where they are. So! What are we waiting for? Collect them from work and round them up! The whole gang and their families! If you ask me: Democracy is for the good times! Today we need a strong leader! One who forges ahead! One who is ready to get his hands dirty! One who will clean the country with an iron broom! Up against the wall! Ready! Bang! All those pacifists! Just the mention of them! Why don't you give them what they deserve? Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! And the traitors to the people! And the foreigners too! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Yes. And first of all, first of all, those so-called artists should be finished off. Don't you agree? Thank you very much for your attention. Have a nice evening. And? What did you think? Thank you! Come on, let's go. This is the man. Do thy office. Antonio, I arrest you in the name of the Duke. You do mistake me, sir. No, sir; I know your favour well. Though now you have no sea-cap on your head. Take him away. I must obey! Who are you? - I am... - Walo Hubacher! His first big role and probably not his last. All right, my dears, we've had a great time. We worked hard. We struggled as a collective, but at eye level. And it was worth it. It's a risk. Yes, it requires trust. And for that I thank you. I'll be crossing my fingers for you tomorrow and don't be late for the premiere. Wait a minute. I'm almost done. Have you had too much to drink? As much as it takes to bear this fucking country! Not a drop more! Isn't that true? Sure. Yes, of course. You've got it easy. You have a job! You're a... whatchamacallit. But you know what it's like not to have a job? Try it! Try it in Switzerland! Can you tell me why I can't ever get a job? Every application, only rejections. Why? I had excellent grades. But you have a job! - You're a radio presenter. - Nobody listens to that! - I know a few people who listen. - Really? That means a lot to me. Would you like some milk? Yes, a little, thanks. Odile, listen... I need to tell you something. Oh, before the first cup of coffee? No, go ahead and drink. Well... What? There's something I have to tell you... Are you gay? - No! - It's happened to me twice before. No, I have... You know... When I came to the theatre, I was a different person than I am today. I mean, on the inside. I lived in a world that... It's difficult to explain. I'll be back. I'll be right back. I can't talk now. - What's going on? - I have a visitor. I am not available. Schuler! I tried to reach you. I really can't talk right now. Is she in there? Yes. She's in there. Did you think for one second about what this means for our department? Lehmann is looking for somebody to blame. I don't have time for this. Schuler, this isn't just about you. It's not about Lehmann or me either. It's about the security of Switzerland. Of course! It's about the security of Switzerland... What are we doing for the security of Switzerland? Surveilling some people with slightly different political opinions. Nothing to hide, nothing to fear. Really? You try getting a job with a record! Try applying to an office! Or to uni or as a teacher! Once you're registered, you have no chance in life! Schuler... Get your jacket and come with me. I'm not going anywhere. You know what? I quit. Walo? Everything okay? Walo? Odile Jola is interesting. I screwed up. Big time. Can I open these? You're a smart guy. But... you have no education at all, no training for this kind of mission. Don't hold it against me. It's psychology. You start to identify with the group you're with. Even if it's your enemy. Stockholm syndrome. Maybe I had Stockholm syndrome before. When I was with you all day. Viktor, look at you. Your shoes. - Whose shoes are those? - Mine. No! These are Walo Hubacher's shoes. And these are Walo's trousers and his sweater. You have become Walo. Fine. I like being Walo. But Walo doesn't exist! I invented him at my kitchen table! You are Viktor Schuler! Son of Hermann Schuler. You are a hard-working, honest policeman! I have to go to the theatre. I have a premiere tonight. Walo Hubacher has a premiere! I'm Antonio! You're in deep. Now take off your robber costume. - That's a start. - No! I have to... What? Go to Odile? She's probably back on some director's lap! She's an actress. TWELFTH NIGHT You all right? - Have you seen Walo? - No. - Have you seen Walo? - No. Walo Hubacher, to the dressing room, please. Walo Hubacher, to the dressing room now. Thank you. That was the second signal. Well? Are you excited? Oh, Starlet... You're a bombshell! Don't forget that. At least with you there's no surprises. - Should I understand that? - No. Toi, toi, toi! I make him an actor and he doesn't show up at the premiere! Well, I could always play the part. It's sure to be stage fright. Happened to me in Saarbrücken once... I can't concentrate like this. Can we play at all? All right, we re-cast. You're Antonio. What country, friends, is this? This is Illyria, lady. And what shall I do in Illyria? If music be the food of love, play on. You really go the whole nine yards, don't you? Let me out. And if I don't? You'll regret this. Why? I only ever followed orders. Open the door! Get lost. The future is digital anyway. You see, sir? Such a one I was this present. Is it not well done? I am one who dares all for love. Even death. Were you sent to praise me or to appraise my price? I see you what you are, you are too proud. Antonio, to the stage. You're on in 5 minutes. Thank you. I have to perform. Cutting it close. - How far are they? - Where were you? I need my costume! Reto has it! - What? - Reto! Between the elements of air and earth, but you should pity me! You could do so much. Oh God! I do I know not what, and fear to find. Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind. Fate, show thy force: ourselves we do not owe. What is decreed must be, and be this so. Odile! Fuck off! What do you want here? - To act. - To act? Yeah. You're good at that! Hello. I'm Walo. I'm a seaman. My parents are living overseas. Odile Jola is interesting. Nobody's ever lied to me like you have! And I've been part of this ensemble for 6 years! Are you crazy? Where were you? - Locked up. - Oh sure! It was a job. It's my job. - What was I supposed to do? - Asshole! We thought you wanted to change Switzerland. That you're all revolutionaries. We had no idea about theatre. What is he saying? That we've become bourgeois twats. Are you out of your minds? Get on stage! What are you waiting for? Out! Out! Now! Now! And us? Was that just an act too? Where has he dropped from? - He was locked up. - He's a cop. - What? - He's a snitch! - Are you explaining the play to me? - No. Eight weeks of rehearsals, now you realize what it's about! Yes. He is an informer, I am a cop, and Cesario is a woman! Cesario is a woman? How stupid do you think I am? He is one in truth! He betrayed us. To the secret service. I don't know... To my father. He is a damn cop! Now I remember him! He's what you're always talking about. He is the arm of the authoritarian state. He's the... Lever of capitalism? He's a fucking nightmare! As long as he knows his lines. All right. Come on. The costume! The costume! A little thing would make me tell them what I lack. The gentleman will, for his honour's sake, have one bout with you. Are you ready? But he still has my costume. Give him the costume! You're an officer again! Over my dead body. Take your clothes off. Take them off! 'Tis truly against your will? Yes. I assure you once more I did not want this duel. It's no use. Out! I know him! He's a regular! Put up your sword. Put up your sword. In every play someone comes out in their underwear! I take the fault on me. You, sir! What are you? Nay, if you be an undertaker, I am for you. O good Sir Toby, hold! Here come the officers! This is the man. Do thy office! Anto... Antonio! I arrest you in the name of the Duke. - You do mistake me, sir. - Who are you? I am one who dares all I am... I... One! Who... Damn it! Who for... I am nothing! I am nobody. I wanted to be someone. I wanted to do it right. Like my father. But... I am not my father. I am not even myself. I really am a nightmare. I've always only seen you as target objects. But you are... people. Nice and funny and vain people. And I want to be a person, too. I know that I can't simply make up to you what I've done. You can't just simply close the matter or put it aside. I don't know how yet, but... you have to be able to face yourself again in the morning. That's what I always say. You may also hate me. I understand. You don't ever have to talk to me again. I just want you to know that I am incredibly grateful to you. You showed me how it might be... to be a person. To live. With you, for the first time, I felt like I was really alive. And do you know what I regret the most? That we didn't take that boat and sailed away together. To the sea. Well said. But now back to the text. Where are we? In Illyria! Who are you? I am one, sir, who dares all for love. Even death. Walo? The part... you earnt it. Congratulations. Now breaking news from today's press conference of the Parliamentary Investigation Commission in Berne. National Councillor Moritz Leuenberger stated that a total of over 900,000 files have been discovered. My goodness! This mentality of "we didn't know anything", "we're not responsible" and "we didn't do anything wrong" cannot be allowed to continue. In connection with events at the Federal Department of Justice and Police, the PIC found a secret archive of the Federal Prosecutor's Office Police. For years, a total of 900,000 people were spied on. I always told you so. Anyone wishing to know whether they were surveilled can now ask the relevant authorities for access to their files. The popular initiative "Switzerland Without an Army" has been rejected. The high percentage of votes in favour, over 35%, surprised both the initiators and the proponents of the army. Claude. Bach... ...mann. Amateur. LAST PERFORMANCE TODAY Put up your sword! I take the fault on me. Your fault, sir? Good, So I will be your undertaker. Where are you going? I don't know yet. They're celebrating downstairs. Fine. Shall we get a drink somewhere else? I'd like that. I'll go get my jacket.
