(explosions) (crowd yelling) (screams) (sirens) Get back! Get back! Maza, 23rd. What's goin' on here? You got me, Detective. Must be a heck of a party up there. Get back! Or you'll wind up street pizza. Claw marks? (gasps) What could be strong enough to leave claw marks in solid stone? Fire! Aargh! Stand fast! We can hold them back! Aye, and catch boulders with our teeth while we're about it. It's your choice, then, me lads. The catapult, or me. Back to your posts. In a few more minutes the sun will be down, and then we'll see some fun. Attacking a castle full of gargoyles near nightfall. This is crazy, and Hakon knows it. No, my friend. That's not crazy. Questioning my sanity when I'm in earshot - that's crazy. I say those gargoyles are naught but chiseled stone, and even if they aren't, it's worth the risk for the plunder within. Attack! (yelling) Huh! Uh! - (growls) - Agh! You are trespassing. - (growls) - Whoa! (men whimpering) - (gasps) - (growls) (Hakon) Fight, men. They are not invincible. (yelling) Shall we let our brothers and sisters have all the fun? Not afraid, are you? Afraid? Me? Huh. Why, all of nature trembles at my passing. I can see why. Aaaagh! - Watch your back, old friend. - Watch your own. Aaagh! - My thanks, Goliath. - I could not do otherwise. These rogues no doubt followed that band of refugees we gave shelter to last night. Oh, look, Mother. Ooh! (groans and breathes heavily) (growling) (roars) Face me, human, if you dare. (hisses) (growls) - I see you've met our watchdog. - (hisses) And my second-in-command as well. I grow tired of this. Take what's left of your men... ...and begone. - Argh! This isn't over, monster. I'll be back. Argh! Oof! - Good work. - Our arrows made 'em run. They'll think twice before coming back. Hm. Goliath, we owe you our lives. As we owe you ours, every day. (medieval music plays) (laughter and chatter) I don't mind telling you, I thought we were all under the sword there for a while. Aye. A fine soldier is our captain of the guard. Captain of the gargoyles, you mean. He'd fit right well on the cornices with them. It's a fact. (both laugh) Our thanks for a battle well fought, good captain. The credit is not mine to take, Your Highness. Without Goliath and his gargoyles our defense would have proven useless. Please, don't mention that monster's name in my presence. (door slams) (gasping) (growls) Your pardon, Your Highness. I took the liberty of asking them to appear and be recognized for their bravery. Captain, we are most seriously displeased. To allow beasts in the dining hall... You speak wisely, Princess. These are unnatural creatures. No good can come from associating with them. Goliath, we named you well, it seems. You are as good a soldier as the Philistine giant who fought David. You would do well to remember, Captain, that the biblical Goliath was also a bully and a savage. (hisses) (gasps) (hisses) If you will excuse us, Your Highness. In the future, Captain, you will make your reports to my advisor, the magus, not directly to me. (Captain) My apologies for this, Goliath. No apologies needed. We are what we are. Her opinion will not change that. Have you no pride? No sense of justice? We saved their lives and they repay us with contempt. She's right, Goliath. You deserve better than this. These cliffs were our home ages before they built their stone fortress. They should bow to us. It is the nature of humankind to fear what they do not understand. Their ways are not our ways. (sighs) There are times when your patience astounds me, my love. (man) You seek the fall of Castle Wyvern? What of it? Perhaps a bargain can be made. I'm listening. Those Vikings may return at daybreak, Goliath. I say, take all your gargoyles and make sure they're gone. I agree. Let us go out in force and put an end to these pigs once and for all. Too dangerous. I don't want to leave the castle unprotected. Their leader swore he'd be back. It's best to harry them far away now and not take that chance. (groans) Very well. But I shall do it. I can scare those cowards away without any help. That's too dangerous for you. Let me come along, at least. You and the others will stay with the castle. You are my best warrior. I leave you in command. No. I cannot let you. I won't go alone. Remember. You and I are one... now and forever. Mm. Mm. (chews noisily) Mm. - Here, catch. - Back this way. Back this way. Over here. (laughter) Yeah, I got it. I got it. Wait. Toss it to me. (grunting) Wait, here. Here. (laughter) Oh, look... Back this way. Back this way. Over here. (laughter) Yeah. I got it. It got it. Wait. Toss it... (growls) I'm Tom. What's your name? Except for Goliath, we don't have names. How do you tell each other apart? - We look different. - But what do you call each other? Friend. Tom. Get away from those monsters. - But, Mother... - We wouldn't hurt the lad, ma'am. Keep away from him, you beast. (roars) (growls) - You're the beast, you... - No. If they think we're beasts and monsters... Then, perhaps we'd better live up to the name. (both growl) (growling) (yelling) Huh? What is it? Are we being attacked again? (gasps) You three, down to the rookery until I return. I'll deal with you then. And take him with you. (whimpers) We meant no harm. Are you blind? They were not at fault. The humans were. No matter who was at fault, I cannot condone fighting between their people and ours. I will make it up to them later. Now I have business to attend to. There. It's them right enough. But the tracks are very light for horses carrying armored men. They're not far ahead. Come. Sent to the rookery. How embarrassing. I haven't been down here since I hatched. I hope we're not down here long. He might eat us. It's not long until sunrise. - Perhaps we should return. - There they are. (shouting) - Here they come now. - Move out of my way! They were leading the horses to decoy us from the castle. We're too late. (growls) (cries out) Attack! - Huh? - What is it? Captain! Captain! The Vikings, Captain. We are attacked. It is worse than that, Your Highness. - Move. - Ah! Now! Not that I'm ungrateful for your help, but why? Why betray your own kind? They're not my kind. Well, to work. There's little enough time for it. This is unnecessary. Are you mad? In a moment they'll be flesh again and my men will be their prey. Once your band is out of sight, they won't follow. It's not their nature. Ah, well. In that case... Oof! Care to discuss the matter further? No. I haven't lived this long by taking foolish chances. No. My... angel of the night. (sobs) (roars)
