A JULIUSZ MACHULSKI FILM STARRING EMBASSY FOR NELA You dropped your book. You dropped your book! Why are you yelling? I picked up your book. Thanks a lot! Wait, haven't we met before? I don't think so. You were in Sphinks on Friday! Your moves were great. Impossible. I don't dance. So maybe I saw you at the library? - No, it wasn't me. Sorry. - I'm Wiesiek. Angelica. I don't usually do that. I'm not a boldfaced guy picking up beautiful strangers. I need to go to the restroom. Will you keep an eye on that? Sure. Excuse me. Where were you? Guys were coming onto me. What kind of city is this? No parking space! Are you done with it? Ifs for you. - Your coffee? - Yes. Oh, shit. Is it here? You said your uncle's rich. Call him. Hello, Uncle, it's Przemek. Yes, we're here. It's just that... there's no number 33 here... Excuse me? Yes, 16 Piekna Si. What apartment number'? - Oh, it's 15? What did you write? - What did I write? Yes, were' here. We'll see you in the morning. Piekna 15 not 16! You always mix things up. - You said 16, and I wrote 16! - It's all right. This is something different! The old meets the new. Awesome! Przemek, here! No plants to water, just my cat. You have to clean its litter box, change the water every 2 days, feed it. And every two weeks cut its claws. Scisors and all are in the cabinet. Miss Jolanta comes here on Tuesdays and Fridays to clean. The money for her is in this desk drawer. On August 23 I'm having a wardrobe delivered, but they'll call before. Winston, stay. You're alone in this house, I mean in this building. On the same ﬂoor there are two legal offices. So ifs quiet after 5 pm. Any questions? Isn't it too loud? Because of the street? - Absolute silence. Modem technology. - So we can gel a good night's sleep? But my advice is to go to sleep before midnight. What was here before? A parking lot. Since 1945. In the center of the city? And before that? - Mela! - I have no idea. You really favor your grandpa! I know. Dad told me. Winston’s stressed out. Ifs moulting, as if it senses something. Mela! Mela! Have you lost your mind? What a mess! Owes. Somebody lives here, you know? What? - Did you hear that? - Mela... Somebody was typing. - So what? - Your uncle said we're alone in this building. Perhaps someone moved in? But isn't it strange that somebody's typing? - Now, in the era of laptops? - Tadeusz Konwicki always types. - Maybe he moved in here. - Oh no, Tadeusz writes with a pen. - And then he has it typed. - Again, the same. Did you hear it? I can't hear it. You're pulling my leg. No, I'm not. Hold on. And? - Nothing! - I heard it! - You're paranoid! - And you're deaf! Congratulations on your great behavior. We were supposed to enjoy every moment here, ponder life... You were supposed to ponder! I'm all right! Yeah, but it's you, who's going bananas. Don't be so stiff! Good night and good luck! Warsaw, 15 Piekna St. The 1920 ties. On 15 Piekna Street, formerly Pius XI St, there was the Klara Dillenius Palace. It was built by her brother Wilhelm... What was your first dream in the new place? - None. You know I don't have dreams. - Even cows have dreams! - They may, but I don't. - And I had a strange dream. - Meaning? - I saw live people, - but I knew they were dead. - I see dead people! "Sixth Sense"?. Exactly. And there's a reason for it. I checked what was here before. - Where? - Here. What? Klara Dillenius's Palace stood here from the end of the 19th century. Where's my yogurt? - There're lots of them. - They're all 4% fat. And I got a light yogurt for myself! Sorry, I may have eaten it by mistake. Mela, I've asked you so many times! The stuff on the right is for me. The stuff on the left is for you! I'm sorry. Relax, please! Is it the end of the world? It is. You ate a yogurt that was part of my diet. - So what?! - We had an agreement! Go to a notary public to sign a culinary agreement! Is that so important? Not everything that you find unimportant is unimportant. You've distracted me again, Mela. I'm already late. I love you. Bye. Julek? Hi! Yes, it's me. Long time? Perhaps, but let's not talk about all I did for the last 2 years. Where am I? You'll never guess! Just tell me where this great place is. - 15 Piekna St. - I don't mean that' I'm asking about the hellhole you escaped to. You're asking about The Wilderness. It was in Bieszczady. Fucking hell, Mela! An actress living in Bieszczady? Fucking... I made a deal with Przemek, that the first 2 years would be for him. So I see it's really serious love. What a pity. Really, what a pity. Have the 2 years passed? - They've just finished. - Really? Great! I'll get you a role at Krystyna's. What Krystyna? What? What? What Krystyna? Hush... Now. - I can't hear anything! - Are you kidding? Now you can't? For the love of God, I can't hear anything! I can hear a cab. What cab? Stop kidding around! You really don't hear anything? I told you it's a strange place. And that dream last night. What dream? I dreamt about the German Embassy. German? Why German for that matter'? Because the German Embassy was here before WW ll. Germans bombed it by mistake in September 1939. 18 people were killed. Oh, I see. Friendly fire? That's not funny at all. Their ghosts are here. I swear. I'm like a seismograph. You don't believe your own words. And who just heard a cab and a typewriter? I was inﬂuenced by you! I don't like it here anymore. You brought a laptop on a romantic outing? Just in case I get inspired. - It was supposed to be a day for us! - It will be just for us. Przemyslaw Reiter speaking. Yes, I remember, tomorrow. What? Today? Sure I can. No problem. I can come today. Now?! I'll be there in 15 minutes. Thank you. Yes! Where are you going? I thought you could wait in the car. When it's so hot outside? You can wait in the cafeteria, I'll be back in an hour. - Why can't I go with you? - It's a business meeting. - I'd rather you didn't. - Are you ashamed of your wife? Mela! You don't bring a whole family here. On October 5, 1939 all this could've ended, if an attempt to kill Hitler - had been successful. - The bomb that our sappers planted at the comer of Aleje Jerozolimskie and Nowy Swiat? Jan Nowak Jezioranski wrote about it. Ifs believed that there was no attack because the sappers hand trembled. The order was to launch the bomb if 100% certain that Hitler was in the car. My belief is that Hitler died that day! Germans hid the fact from the world, and the war was conducted by a Lepke - Hitler's double, a puppet. I'm on the trail of documents that'll prove that. You are serious, aren't you? Is it supposed to be a war fantasy thriller'? No. I understand ifs hard to believe that... If nobody's discovered it for 70 years, we won't make fools of ourselves either. And the title... The title's great! "New 1939.” - It's like a statistics book. - Maybe a title with Hitlers name? Do you think so? Excuse me, I overheard a bit by accident. How about: "You Thought You're Smart, But Look Who's Winning"? Mela! Let me introduce... - Melania, my wife... - Nice to meet you. Excuse me? Me - your wife? Since when?! She loves this trick. Mela, it's not a good time. - Could you leave me alone? - She's an frustrated actress. - Jesus! How old are you? - Don't touch me. Take care of your own life! Excuse me! She thinks she's being eccentric! So Hitler died, and that was your wife? You're not going to talk to me? You used to have a sense of humor. What now? Heil Hitler. What?! Mela? Yes? Come! Leave it! I need to show you something! - You're not mad at me anymore? - Somethings wrong here. - Well, I agree. - I'm talking about this building. - Come on! - What? The garbage room is locked? I saw Germans! They were speaking German! Over there. So what? Europe is open! Can't we have German neighbors? It's even better! I'll brush up my German! - Maybe they're nice? - Nice? In uniforms? Come in! What do you want? Petitioners aren't allowed on this ﬂoor. Get out, please. Excuse me, are you shooting a film? Otto! I need you here. Just a minute. Excuse me, what are you doing here? And what are you doing here? You are in the German Embassy. Oh, fuck! it can't be true. Fuck! It is true. These are the ghosts, the people from my dream! Ghosts? These are real people! - One had a pimple on his nose! - Can't a ghost have a pimple? We can't both have hallucinations at the same time! These are real people! But why in Nazi uniforms? - Maybe ifs a happening? - Please! Only gays and lesbians can do it in front of the Seym? Or maybe there's a hidden camera? - Open the door! - What impudence! Who's that? Gestapo! - What are you doing in the Embassy? - Mela, translate! Excuse me, Sir, but the German occupation ended in January 1945. You insolent Polish swine. I'd shoot you if it weren't for the fact that it's your birthday today! - What? " Birthday? Mela! You knew that and conned me?! - Why do you always do that to me? - So that you relax, you stiff! Julek, Staszek and Ola. My friends from the Theater Academy. Hi! Then he looks at me and I see that he has very big brown eyes. Brilliant! Do you really find it funny? A joke about a faggot. Come in! Guys, I'm sorry, but I need to have 32 tip top clean for tomorrow, because I have serious clients first thing in the morning. So do this tip top cleaning yourself. Yes? Where are you? Two men with a wardrobe are here! What's that about? - Ask Roman Polanski! - What? Your uncle mentioned a wardrobe. Don't you remember'? I don't... Mela! Just let them in and get it done! You're creating problems in your head. They say they don't have a key! What do you care? They'll explain it to your uncle! Over there. Cool! You put me on the spot. Excuse me? I apologize. I recall that "stiff". You're such a babe. You're amazing! What do you want from me? All right, all right. I underestimated you. My respect. Ifs the third ﬂoor! Have you eaten enough? What's the matter'? David Copperfield?! How did you do it? Those wardrobe guys have just left! They kept asking me questions! And now you! Could I have 5 minutes of peace? Awhile ago, you were with me in the elevator and got off on the 3rd ﬂoor. - What's going on? - "Let's go to Warsaw, "you'll have great conditions for writing in your uncle's ﬂat. "I won't want anything from you. " - What? - Come with me, please. Shit... - But, baby. - You'll see. Mela! - I don't understand. - Can I get back to my creative work? - The elevator! - What about it? - We have to take the elevator! - My dead-line is on the 17th! I'm lost. I don't know if I love you more when you're going crazy or when you let me live. No, sorry... I see you went at full throttle. Honest to God. It's not me this time. Petitioners aren't allowed on this ﬂoor. Get out, please! We don't understand you. - I want... - Anton! I need you here! Przemek! Look! Anton, take them out from here. You cannot be here! It's the Reich's Embassy. I will escort you to the exit. Okay. Bye. I see you miss your profession, your evening performances. The fourth. Come to us for tea. How about him moving in? Why are you dragging him here? How about the 9th commandment: "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbors wife!" - Don't you see he's identical? - To whom? To you, idiot! Are you blind? Please, come in! - I look like this slick dickhead? - You're like two peas in a pod! The Decalogue is very sexist. How about 'Thou shalt not covet the husband"? Who's husband? Thy neighbors? A wife was worth less than a goat then. Exactly. It needs to be updated. Where did you get that? - My uncle bought it. - We have one like that downstairs. - Do you have the key? - The guys who brought it lost it. - What's this? - Good evening. The TV? Is that what you mean? Li's the 73rd anniversary of signing the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact. On August 23, 1939, a secret protocol of this pact was signed according to which in the case of a Polish-German war, the border between the Third Reich's and the Soviet Union's spheres of interest, would be the Narew-Vistula-San line. Two signatures on this document: Molotov's and Ribbentrop's practically signified disaster for Poland. Which year is this? 2012. 2012? - You traveled in time. - Mela, - please! - What's your name? Ne you Armor" Rene: by any chance'? How do you know?! Most probably you're my husbands great grandpa, present here! Excuse me, but my great grandpa was a handsome man. - He is handsome. - 73 years difference. Oh, I know. You are also from the Drama School? Naughty boy. Don't they have any more roles in the TV series? Of course! it's so easy to find an asshole identical to you. - I must go back there. - Absolutely. Won't you have some tea? There's a theory that if the universe is like a big apple, then a worm that wants to get to the other side, instead of crawling on the surface, can bite through the pulp of the universe to make a short cut. - And this is traveling in time! - It's Wheelers theory of wormholes from 1955. It's bullshit. - Most evidently it's not. - It is' You got my favorite pencil dirty! Stop! - What are you doing here? - I'm sorry. - It's her again. - What's going on here? Polish spy! Bring her to me! Hold on, please. Hold your horses! - Take them off immediately! - Shut up! It hurts. You want it in German, fine. First of all, you'll lake your hand away and second, you'll let me go. It's also August 24 upstairs. It means that in one week all will be fucking ruined, because the war will start. In one week all will be fucking ruined, as the war will start. How does she know that? It's the Führer's secret order! Can you take them off? Who are you? I'm the one who asks questions here. How do you know about September 1st? Have you just come down from Mars? Everybody knows that. She's a SPY- We need to interrogate and kill her. Easy, Otto. We'll have time to kill her. Yes, ifs a good idea. Oh, no. How do you know about the fuhrer's secret order? If you're shooting a film and have a hidden camera here, I must congratulate you. I've been taken in. But if this is the truth, I can tell you how the whole shit will end. - What shit? - The Second World War! The Americans and Russians will kick your ass. Poles will loo: at the battle of Monte Cassino or of England. And finally, this loser, your Führer, will shoot himself with a ﬂare gun right in the face. Anton, what is she raving about? Wait! This can be really important. Who sent you here? The Mad Hatter! Holy shit! You could've shot me! Ifs some spy code. Let Felting know there is a leak somewhere. Oh, fuck! I'm an officer of the Polish intelligence! I've been on this mission for 2 years, and you could've exposed me! Oh, shit! What mission? I have to steal a cipher machine from them. Enigma?! How do you know its name? A wreath? For whom? Just to cover our tracks. Tomorrow we'll put it on the Grave of the Unknown Soldier. Great idea. isn't it? Damned Soviet ink. Where can I wash my hands and change my clothes? Here. Please. Mela! Mela! Hello? - Hi. - What is this? What are you doing with this garbage? Burning it? Recycling? I can't talk, I'm in a meeting. I can't say. - Attention! - Don't hang up. Hello. And this is supposed to be that psychic? - Does she know German? - Yes. Yes, but I can translate, Mr. Minister. Ask her if the war will start and when, and how it will end. Can you remind me exactly when WWII started? Are you serious? WWII started on September 1, 1939... ...at 4:45 with shots fired from the battleship Schleswig-Holstein, which... on August 25, tomorrow, will come to the harbor in Gdansk. I'll be damned. No one knows that apart from me and the Fuhrer, I mean the Fuhrer and me. When does it end? May 8, 1945 with the Germans unconditional capitulation. How about Mr. Ribbentrop? After the war, he'll be sentenced to death and hanged. On October 16, 1946 in Nuremberg? Well, it will hurt! She is dangerous! She was brought here to spread defeatism! And if she has a gift of clairvoyance, it's even worse. The Fuhrer must see her. What does she have in her hand? A mobile phone. A smartphone. A gadget from the 21 st century. You never part with it' We need to take her to Berlin! Mister, I'm from different time and I have this information only here. What is she raving about? Sir, if you allow me, I want to show you something' But first we must free her. Why? Only she can take us there. Sure! - 4th ﬂoor'? - Yes. Apartment 33. Please. Mela? Please! Stop this from happening! - Shut up! - Hey, hold on, man. - I'll have bruises. - We won't talk this way. - Shame on you! - Mr. Minister, you're a well-mannered man. Please, tell your bodyguard to take some break. Look at this nutcase. Where did he come from? From Berlin. Which year is it? Tum on a history channel or a film about WWII, I've got parched from all this explaining. It's like a radio, but with vision. You call it "Fernsehen... That's a very good name. Why don't we have it yet? Where is it made? - In Japan. - That's very convenient. Our allies! I'll ask the Emperor to send us over some. Can anyone explain to this man that we are in the 21st century? Traveling in time? Magic? Occultism! The Fuhrer loves these things. We need to take this contraption to Berlin! Moron! This contraption won't work there! You're over 70 years behind us! It works only here. In a moment a verdict will be pronounced. Everybody in the room froze with tension. Ribbentrop. That's me. I got slim. Sure, after a year and a half in prison. It wasn't vacation with Euroreisen. Death by hanging. Death by hanging. But because we know all this earlier, we can change the ﬂow of history. Everything will be all right. You know, that I've always wanted to be a musician? What about them Mr. Minister? Watch them. Guard them with your life. Yes Sir, Mr. Minister. Stay here. I'll take turns with you. Don't tell me that was the real Joachim von Ribbentrop?! Who, if not him? Believe me, ifs happening' That guy shot at me. What's he saying? Speak German. Ribbentrop or not, I don't care. You weren't supposed to bother me. - I want to write. I don't have time. - Stop it! Time is fucked up here! We need to run! - Run? What about my book? - You can take your laptop. Don't talk! You Poles. Thank you. You can go. - Where is my apartment? - Ingeborg! Take Mr. Minister to his room. At your service, Mr. Minister. Would you like some tea? Or coffee? I can make you a sandwich. I'd rather have beer. We have beer too. Good. Mela, shall I help you? You - sit down. I'm not joking. Here you are. You need to arm it like a grenade. Quick! Let's tie him up. - With what? - There's tape somewhere around. Take his gun. - See you tomorrow. - See you. See you. The end. Przemek! A pencil. A notebook. My laptop. I'll never write this book. Not under the supervision of the Third Reich! We're going back home. Anton! Anton! My darling! - You didn't go home? - We're finally alone! Ingeborg, we cannot do it here! Were on duty. Why are you always so principaled? You can relax at this late hour. The enemies of the Reich aren't sleeping. Let's do it under the portrait of the Fuhrer! I've always dreamt about it. Li's very nice of you, but I still have some duties lo fulfill. Can't we put them off. Let's put off what we're doing now. Anton! Anton! Come with me! Let's get out of here. There is one thing I must do. Heil Hitler! Thank you. Hail victory! Thank you very much for your welcome. My trip here is absolutely secret and incognito. The fewer people that know I'm here, the better. And now go back to your tasks. - We're in the Embassy garage. - Mela! You always get me into something! Last year it was a music festival! And now this! I need peace! Is it so hard to understand it? - It may be the adventure of your life. - And I have a dead-line. - In 3 weeks I might lose this job. - There're still 21 days! - And you've traveled. Write about it. - Forget it. I'm going. - We're stuck in the meantime. Because of you! - Sure. - I need you to help me. - Don't even think about it. - Sure, but how? - There's a chance this war won't happen. - Really? - Hitler must be assassinated. There were many attempts. He's lucky! It won't work. It will. There'll be an explosion, but Lepke must die too. What Lepke? Hitler will come here tonight. Ribbentrop convinced him over the phone to come and see the tricks on your... Television! I should go to the hairdressers. How about calling the antiterrorist squad to wait for him? I can't wait, doing nothing. I'll kill him, or die trying. Stay cool! We'll kill the leader. - We'? Don't count me in. - It's enough you're a database. Well done, Przemyslaw! It fits! - Is it yours? - You put something in here? No, the key was missing. I thought so. What is it? Enigma. A German cipher machine? I see it's not a washing machine! Is it good or not? I have a plan! It's fricking awesome. Tired after the journey, mein Fuhrer'? There's everything. A bathroom, bedroom and office. Where is the toilet? The rest room is there, mein Fuhrer. The sooner we do it, the better. - Where is this seer man'? - It's a woman, mein Fuhrer. - Upstairs. - A woman? Ribbentrop, why haven't you brought her here? Because she herself is not enough. That contraption works only on the 4th ﬂoor. Is the prophecy really so unfavorable for the Third Reich? The first 4 years are not so bad, but from 1943 it's going to be bad for the Third Reich. So maybe we should put off your wonderful plan till 1941? Nonsense! Go back to selling champagne, Ribbentrop! In 1941 I have to be in Moscow! The latest! - Moscow? - You have something to say, Ribbentrop? No! Moscow... Good idea. Ribbentrop, leave me alone for a moment. Ende, safeguard. My red brother. Goddammit! He got knocked in the head! - He'll be okay. - Who's this? Anybody else would get a concussion. This one will be fine. How could he, I mean, our beloved Fuhrer, how could he vanish? You were supposed to safeguard him! He asked me to leave him alone. Our Fuhrer decided to go to the toilet. - He's only human. - What now? Has he sank into the bowl? Who's missing? Otto Klatsch and Anton Reiter! Oh, so it's them! Anton? That's impossible! I'll check this. Guard him! What...? Ende! Ribbentrop! Where am I? In the future! It's not me! Not me! And who's that? My double! This idiot, Lepke! Lepke? What is he saying? He's saying it's his double, Lepke. Yes! I knew it was true with that Lepke! We know this kind of excuses! I need an interview with him! Help me! What is this all about? Ifs a treachery! Coup d'état! Untie me immediately! We'll let you go if you give up the idea of the Polish corridor, cancel the pact with Stalin, give us back Gdansk, Szczecin and Wroclaw, and... as the Fuhrer you will retreat lo hell! What? Never! Are you recording this? All the time! - Revenge for Katyn! - Katyn? Mela! These were Russians! Sure!Entschuldigung. Sorry! Ifs for the Uprising! You'll pay me for this! Call off the operational readiness of Wehrmaht, Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine! How can I do that, when you're pinching my tits? What's he saying? He can't do it while we're pinching his tits... Ouch! It hurts! It is supposed to hurt. So, what? So, what? Will you do what we're asking for'? You don't know what you're doing. You're signing your own death sentence! The executioner's axe is being sharpened already! For now, ifs us who have the axe, and we can end the whole 1000-year-old Reich in 3 seconds! I'm not talking to you, woman! Your place is in the kitchen! Excuse me? My place is in the kitchen?! In your face! Ouch! Stop it! Be good. We can do whatever we want with you. Don't you understand, idiots!? Even when I vanish, they're going to continue without me! Who are they? Göring, Hess, Himmler, Goebbels! Anyone! All of them want my job! I didn't know it's such fun! Przemek! Do you want to try? Stop this nonsense! Come on! You'll tell your grandchildren how you scratched Hitler's face! - I want an interview, not grandchildren! - Come on! You'll regret it later! Damn! You can't even slide a sheet of paper on Hitlers face! - It must be upright! - No! Sorry. The revenge is going to be sweet! - You won't have a chance. - So? Will you cancel the war or do we continue the game? - Are you Jewish by any chance? - Am I Jewish? Maybe? - This can be true. - Are you Jewish? Are you going to listen to a fascist? What difference does it make? What can you say about these two? One of them used to be your superior'? Anton Reiter is a very good boss and an honest German. Where did he come from? From Ausbreussen. He must have valued patriotism. It's unimaginable that he could have been a part of such a horrible action. And the second one? Otto Klatsch. Otto Klatsch. Otto has always been different, - strange. - What? Otto Klatsch is from Bavaria. A Bavarian? Damned yodelers! Sausages and mandolins! I'm Bavarian, Ende! But Your Excellency! Every child knows you were born in the Rhineland, not in Bavaria, where there're only whores and football players. Ende! My wife comes from Bavaria. Honourable Mrs. Annelise? So, what football team does your wife play on? No! Stop wriggling! Or I'll hurt you! Get out of my sight! Well! Now it's good! How is it? Do you like it? Are we canceling the war or not? How will I face people? Nobody will listen to me. You can do it on the phone. No way! You have no idea what you've done! The Polish Corridor was only a bluff! I hoped Poland would roll over and play dead like Austria or Czechoslovakia. Now I know you're going to fight, so I retreat. What a pity you didn't think about it earlier. You can still withdraw your order. How? Withdraw?! Without my moustache!? This monster Lepke is only waiting to jump into my place in history! He's a thousand times worse than me! Listen. I've read that when they examined his remains in 1945, it turned out he had only one testicle. Is that true, Przemek? The autopsy of Hitlers body proved, that the great Fuhrer had only one testicle. No! No! It's Lepke! Lepke has one testicle! I have two! All in the right place. Two? Then show us! What?! Let the Jewish woman turn away! Of course. I don't want to puke. Przemyslaw! Listen! Is he circumcised by any chance!? Are you circumcised? None of your business. Ifs my and Ewa's business! Really? This would be a joke! Hitler or not - I hate the sight of male genitals. I'm coming back. You have the only chance in life to twist Hitlers balls, and you prefer to create?! Maybe you don't have the balls?! We need to finish the Enigma case. I will need your husband. Przemek?! Captain Antoni Reiter wants to charge you with a very responsible task. I won't even listen! This would be our little input in the victory over the Third Reich! - We'll be proud. - But the Reich doesn't exist! It doesn't in our times, but in his - it exists. When I finish my interview, you can strangle Hitler. I'm not fit to be a crusader! - Do you want us to win this war'? - Us? Us. The anti-Hitler coalition, that is... well... - What'll I get out of this? - You'll do something good. As a Pole. - You said you wanted to be in the AK. - What? What is the AK? - I'll tell you later. - What will I gel out of this? - Fame and glory. - Phew! Fame and lame! I got operational gold reserves for the action. Nice! Gold has appreciated lately. - Is 2 pounds enough? - 10 would be better. I'm doing this out of patriotic duty! Now you're kidding me! As if I didn't know you! What's wrong with being a patriot? How to put it, Antoni... Bad people have spoilt our patriotism. It's a little worn out. - I can't believe I am doing it! - All right. It will be okay. The glasses! I need to relax. I'll check on Otto. We must get rid of him. You scared me! Never do it again! Where is he?! Has he vanished? Anton! Here you are, you pig! Get up! Get up! Where is our Fuhrer Adolf Hitler!? - Where is our fuhrer Adolf Hitler!? - Stop it! Don't you see he's unconscious? Besides, he's here, so he couldn't have kidnapped the Fuhrer! - So, who did it? - Otto! Can't you see? Tell me what happened. "Otto Klatsch kidnapped the Fuhrer from the Embassy and took him to an embassy..." Which one?! "Probably the American one". What has he written? Ifs classified! They've found Otto! They got him? Where is he? He's lying on the pavement in the street. He must have fallen from the roof! Fate's protecting us! And the Fuhrer? We're still looking for him. This way, please. Poor thing! I'll take care of you, poor thing. At last! Finally alone! You're Jewish? Where are we? - What is this? - It's a trap! Here's the main entrance. We can get to the 1st staircase and all the front ﬂats. - Have you sold many ﬂats? - Halt! Excuse me! You are from Julek? Too much pudding will choke the dog. You're scaring my clients. Go away! Now! Excuse me. What's going on here? Herr Consul, make the car ready. I'm going back to Berlin! What about the Fuhrer'? The Fuhrer is already there! I'm very happY- You are free. Now, you will get spanked! Enigma is in British hands! What? There will be no war. No! But I withdraw the orders! As soon as my moustache grows back. Hands up! Thank God! Ende! I thought I would never live to this moment. Is it you, mein Fuhrer'? Who else? Goebbels? No, but you look different... Shut up and continue sewing! Yes, Sir! Release our Fuhrer! What are you waiting for'? And you, traitor, will be taken to Berlin' You know what for. You know what'll happen then. The most horrible tortures of the world. I myself with pleasure... And now, I'm going to tell you, what will happen. You will open the balcony door, and you'll throw your dead pals into the street. Ende! - Okay, okay... - Take this, please. Easy. Thank you! Ifs nothing, but I wouldn't like to do it again! What was that? And now, mein Fuhrer... What an Ubermensch! Adolf, we're going to have a drink, and you're going back to the Embassy. I don't drink alcohol! What's going on here, a happening? A happening? Do you know who this is? - Well? - Der Fuhrer Adolf Hitler! - Adolf Hitler... - Mr. Ober, this is Adolf Hitler! - I am Antoni Macierewicz. - This is Adolf Hitler. - Without a moustache. - Hitler with no mustache isn't Hitler. You can drink and dance, but never with stinkers. Bravo! Bravo! Very good. Our scientists have reached the conclusion, that the fusion of German orderliness with the imaginativeness of Poles would give perfect results. Don't suck up, all right? I can understand everything. September '39, the Uprising '44, but why the fuck did you ruin my city later'? It wasn't me! It was Lepke! Of course! Today nobody is guilty! Okay. We've jogged, drank and we are going back. BERLIN THE REICH CHANCELLERY Heil Hitler! Good morning, Herr Lepke! That is Mein Fuhrer! To such a crouching in the darkness in order to stab their neighbors, Germans, in the back, in spite of the non-aggression pact, to such a disgraceful violation of the rules of the civilized world, there can be only one answer! Easy! We are not in the Reichstag! You can mess around later. Now, talk like a normal man. What are we doing? All right. All right. I've just wanted to assume the role. They need a fucking slap in the face. We've always believed in you, mein Fuhrer! After you, mein Fuhrer! They have found the dead bodies of Hans, Kurt and that guy who came with the Fuhrer. They fell from the roof, but first somebody shot them. I'm starting to dislike it. Soon we'll be short of staff! Jawohl! Well, should I care at all? I am hereto love...! Mela! Why do you always do this to me?! I'll explain. She jumped on me, for she thought I was Anton. You didn't want to tell the poor thing the truth? - I didn't want to unmask us. - But, of course! Which of you is the real one? " He! " He! You are mine! I'm Przemek. I'm very sorry, but I'm married. Don't take it too seriously. Really?! Really. Let's change clothes. The wife. Melania Reiter. Nice to meet you. Przemek! Since 4:45 our forces on the land, at sea, and in the air have been fighting the Poles! This war could have been avoided! The price of peace was high, but measurable! But we Germans don't know the concept of peace at all costs. You think they won't bomb us thanks to this? - On the contrary! - This is supposed to look like a hospital. I see. I didn't know you liked blondes! She's a simple girl, that's true. But very warm and sensitive. Not like me. You could learn a few things from her. Well! You could learn a few things from your great grandfather! Let's go to the shelter! Relax, Inge! They won't bomb a hospital! Junkers'87! Stukas with their infamous "Jericho Trumpets"! My friends! My beloved Luftwaffe! Perfect timing! - How does it look? - Fake. There's no time! Here stands your Fuhrer. Anton, help me. Przemek! Come on! - Don't leave me, Anton! - But I'm Przemek. Przemek! Leave her, come here! - Melania! - I can't leave her! Why not? What about me? You've just met her! - I would save even a cat! - Where is the cat?! Your Führer's waiting! Look, this guy looks exactly like our Fuhrer! Like his twin! But he has a fake moustache! Help! Przemek! - Jump! - Przemek! Przemek! Are you okay? Do you mind? - You've come home early? - Why early? Unbelievable. You look like my grandfather. He's bought contact lenses! What game are you playing? I see... Wash yourselves. Who is it? - He's your... - I'm waiting for you. Come. Incredible! I've been thinking about buying this apartment also. - Beautiful view. - It's great. Your grandmother used to say that the view is the most important. And the first sight. Wait! Where's the Palace of Culture? Palace of Culture? It's always been there! - What are you talking about? - Stop messing with me! - A gift from Stalin! - Stalin? What's that warlord got to do with us? After the war, when the Russians took power... Uncle! This is your generation's history! Do you mean the Polish-Soviet war'? They lost it. I mean the Second World War! There was no Second World War. There was the Great War of 1914-18 and nothing after. But on September 1, 1939 there began". Oh! You mean the September Incident! That was only 2 weeks! We chased the Germans away. - Without Hitler, they got lost. No motivation. - No Hitler'? Especially that they killed him by mistake themselves. They killed him'? - What grade did you get in history? - A very good one! So, you should know. On September 1 Hitler was in their Embassy in Warsaw, and the Germans bombed it. They killed their fuhrer! What about Hitlers double, Lepke, who was supposed to replace him? There were rumors. Since 4:45 we answer the shots with the shots. Every bomb will pay for a bomb! Gentlemen, the Fuhrer is dead. Don't we have another one? On September 17, Germans signed a surrender in Wroclaw, which they had to give back, - together with Szczecin and Olsztyn. - And Vilnius and Lvov? - What? - They're ours? Whose else? Don't tell me China is our neighbor. So, there was no Uprising? So, Warsaw exists? The one from before the war'? Not destroyed? What have you been smoking? Uncle! You're wonderful! We're taking you to dinner! No, I'm inviting you to a new... restaurant! Are you going? Here's a great restaurant. Delicious tzimmes and stuffed goose neck! I'll find a table. Julek! - Meleks! - Hi! Hi, Przemek! Meet my friends. Ingeborg'? Inge... what? Ingeborg'? - My name's Nela. - Sure, and you don't know Przemyslaw? Przemyslaw's standing here. But my great grandmother's name is Ingeborg, and my great grandfather was named Przemek. How are they? Great grandfather died 15 years ago. - Haven't we met somewhere? - Excuse me? Let's get in touch and meet. We'll talk and chatter. Now, we're going. - Bye. - You have to drop by. I live near the beach now. We'll go for a swim.
