Hey, you get back here! Get back here right now! Daphne! Come here! Gotcha, Daphne. No, stop! No, she's gonna get what she deserves! What the hell are you doing? She's not coming back. You'd better be right. I like your resume, Daphne! Lots of experience, plenty of references. Thank you! So, why do you want to work here? This might sound silly, but taking care of people, it's... well, it's more than just a job for me. It's a calling. Yeah, yeah, I know what you mean. So why the six month gap? - Excuse me? - I mean, on your resume, it says that you haven't worked in six months. Why not? I was in a difficult marriage. Husband wouldn't let you work? He was abusive... physically and sexually, I... You know, you don't have to get into it. I literally had to run away from him. It was a mess, but I'm better now. I got a new house, fresh start. I am ready to get back to work. Finally. Please, I really need this job. Welcome aboard. Ready, set... go! Yes! 7.3? - Is that bad? - It's not great. It's gotta get a lot better. Well, I'm proud of you anyway. Let's get something to eat. - I'm starving. - Okay. I forgot to ask, did you hear back from Stanford? Not yet. I'm not so sure they're gonna accept me. They will. Don't worry about college, you just graduated. You should be taking it easy. Easy for you to say, Mr. Track Scholarship. - It's them. - Who? Palo Alto. The recruiter, she's texting me. Oh, my God, oh, my God. Look, baby, why don't you just, like, pull over and... It's okay, I'm just gonna... Hey, Mom, what's up? Hi. You guys were in an accident. - Do you remember? - Baby, I'm so sorry. It's cool, I feel all right. A little headache, but I'm good. Whatever dope they gave me is totally working. I can barely feel my legs. The doctor said it was a lower spinal injury. It's something called a severed L5, which is why you're numb from the waist down. It's just temporary, right? Right? There's just no way of knowing at this time. But hopefully you'll improve. This... it's a mistake. Sweetheart, it's okay. It's... it's gonna be okay, sweetie. Shh, hey, shh, sweetheart. No, it's not right! Please stop. Stop it. Come on, it's gonna be okay. What are you telling me it's going to be okay... - Please, shhh. - Will you stop shushing me? Honey, I... - Hello? - Hi. My name is Daphne Jones, and I'm a caregiver. I'm the Regional Operations Manager for a major hotel chain, so I'm on the road three weeks out of the month. I wish I could be here for him full-time, but I can't. I'm okay with full-time! I'll see what your son can do and build on that. And before you know it, he's made the adjustment. Just having you here right now, I can't tell you how much better I'm feeling. By the way, on the technical side, I know CPR, psychomotor, and cognitive exams. And I have an EMT approved first aid kit. Basically everything a paramedic has. That's great. Why don't I introduce you to Tony? Okay! Tony, this is... Tony? Tony. This is Daphne. Daphne, this is Tony. I don't need her. Yes, you do, and don't be rude. Tony, think of me as a trainer. You already have the heart of a champion. Not afraid of a challenge, are you? We'll work to get you independent and on your own as quickly as possible. Give me a month. One month. - What are you doing here? - Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you! Your mom gave me a key. Here, let me help you. Good. Jasmine's coming over, so you can go. - What's happening? - Ah, involuntary spasms. Your legs need circulation, so your body compensates. Be right back. When your muscles go into spasm, they need a deep massage. You need this on a regular basis to stimulate the nerve endings and help the lymphatic system. Breathe. Okay. I think I'm okay now. - Good. - Um... thank you. That's what I'm here for. We should get you a bath. No way. Come on, hop on. I didn't know this was a part of the treatment. It is. I need to do a physical check of your groin area. Do you have to? Skin disorders can happen if everything isn't clean. Yes, I have to. Tony, this is my job. Don't worry, it's not the first time I've done this. You're doing great, Kyle. What? I said, "You're doing great!" You said "Kyle." Who's Kyle. Kyle? Oh, Kyle, a former client of mine. My mistake. Tony? We're in the bathroom! I found this doctor... Oh, hi. Hi! Daphne Jones. I'm Jasmine. - I'm sorry, I was just... - It's okay. Come here. Hey. So what's this about a new doctor? Yeah, I read this article. There's this doctor in Torrance. He specializes in a new surgery. It's called selective peripheral neurotomy. Wanna put that in English? It's a brand new spinal surgery, the first of its kind. His patients couldn't walk before, and now they can. - What? - Disabled patients are walking again thanks to this guy. It's still sort of experimental and they're not sure if it'll last, but... But it's worth a try. It's worth a try. I wouldn't get your hopes up. What do you mean? I've heard about this kind of thing for years. Usually, it's a hoax. Just saying. I mean, we're still gonna give it a try, right, babe? Right, yes! Come here, get in! Tony! Don't you take him from me. Don't you take him from me. Don't you take him from me. Don't you take him from me. Don't you take him. Don't you take him from me. Don't you take him from me, don't you take him from me. Don't you take him from me. Well, it's revolutionary, it's controversial, and extremely dangerous, but the fact is, we have reversed paralysis in patients. What do I have to do? - How do I... - Tony, we don't know... Mom, please. Are you saying that I have a chance to walk again? We can't jump the gun. Patients must fit a certain criteria, and the majority of patients we have to turn away. But after reviewing your son's test results, he definitely falls within the parameters. Now, having said that... there is a chance of more neural damage if the procedure doesn't hold. I don't care. Tony, I don't think so. It's a very intricate procedure, and your son is an excellent candidate given the combination of his injuries, his youth, muscle tone. It's all good. It is a long surgery, months of therapy... but I strongly believe that your son will walk again. I don't think it's worth the risk, sweetheart. - It's not... - Mom. It's my only chance. Okay then. Let's do it. Most of all, I get a really good vibe from this doctor. And everything I've read about him says he's incredible. - Thanks for finding him. - You're welcome. Well, whatever happens, I'll still be here for you, Tony. Not if Dr. Peters has anything to do with it. He's gonna do his best to put you out of a job, sister. Thank you for this wonderful meal, Jasmine. You didn't have to go through all this trouble. I wanted to... no, no, no, you're not doing the dishes. You've had a long week. I appreciate that. I have a ton of phone calls to return. - Let me help you. - Great, thanks! Mhm! Amazing that you found this doctor. Yes. Doesn't erase what you did, though. Excuse me? Texting and driving? Not bright. You didn't have to say that. Look, Jasmine, it's my job to keep Kyle safe. Kyle? What? I mean, Tony. Kyle was my last client. All I meant was that you should've been more careful. I know what you meant. My boyfriend can't walk, and I'm very much aware that I'm the reason for it. I think about it every other minute, and I don't need you to remind me of it. - Guys, come on. - Somebody needs to remind you to drive safely, might as well be me. Who do you think you are talking to me that way? I'm his caregiver! Tony's health is my number one priority. Just because you wear scrubs and you keep a first aid kit in your car doesn't make you some sort of medical authority. Hey, what's going on? I don't see why she has to be here. I'm perfectly capable of taking care of Tony. We need someone qualified. I'm gonna be going to medical school. I think I'm more than qualified. It's okay, really. I've got nothing to do all summer. I don't go up to Stanford until the end of September, so it's no problem. - Save you a ton of money. - Jasmine, no. - Why not? - Because I don't want you to. If you hadn't been texting and driving, we wouldn't be in this situation right now. Mom. That's the one thing I asked you not to do. I'm sorry, Jasmine, I shouldn't have said that. No, you're right. You're both right. I'm gonna go. No, Ja... Jasmine, no. How's that? Good, I guess. Can't really feel anything. But I'm sure it's working wonders. Smarty pants. Hey, hang on a second. - I'll be right back. - Mhm. Where'd you go? I just went to freshen up. How's that feel? Oh, good. I can definitely feel that. You can open your eyes, you know. I like keeping them closed. Keeps me relaxed. - You sure? - Uh-huh. I'm gonna remove your shorts just to make you a little more comfortable. Whatever works. How's that feel? I'm starting to... I'm starting to feel that. Hi. Hi, babe! Are you ready to go? Movie starts at one, we're gonna be late. Yeah, we're about to be done in a sec, right, Daph? Yeah, a few more minutes. Massages stimulate his neural signaling. I'm sure they'll teach you that in premed. I'll... I'll wait in the living room. Okay. Oh, that's good. I can definitely feel that. Oh, good! Would you relax? She gives me massages all the time. Dressed like that? In that top? Tell you the truth, I didn't get a good look at her 'cause my eyes were closed. Yeah, right. - What's going on? - Nothing's going on. She likes you. I mean, she likes you likes you. As a boyfriend? No, she doesn't. You just don't see it. Girls can tell when other girls are coming on to guys, even if you guys are totally clueless. Okay, I'm totally clueless. And you know why? Because I'm in love with you. Come here, give me a kiss. On second thought, let's wait till we get to a stop light. Yeah, no kidding. Fox residence. How may I help you? Hi, this is Lena from Dr. Peters' office. May I speak with Tony Fox, please? Hi, Lena, this is Daphne, Tony's caregiver. - Right, well, is Tony there? - He's not. Can I take a message for him? It's really important that I speak with either Tony or his mom. She's not here either. Give me the message and I'll have one of them call you back? All right, sure, I guess if you work for them, I can trust you with this. Good news, we did have a cancellation, so a spot has opened up. - Really? - Yes, we can have Tony in for the surgery next Friday. Next Friday, that's fast! Yes, I know, but we do need immediate confirmation, so if you could please have them give me a call back - as soon as possible. - Of course! Tony and Ellen will be really excited. Great! I'm just gonna follow up with an email to... Oh, there's no need for that. I just wrote everything down, and I'm gonna call them right now! - I got this. - Oh, okay, thank you! You're saving me a lot of time. I used to work for a doctor, I know what you're going through. Oh, tell me about it. Thank you so much, Daphne. My pleasure. Bye now. Damn, Jasmine. First you wrecked a vehicle, now you can't even lock it. - Dad, what's going on? - Don't worry about it, sweetheart, go back to sleep. New messages received from Jasmine. - It says it's from you. - It's not from me. You were texting with some guy and you sent it to me by mistake. - Everybody does that. - Tony, look at me. I swear I didn't send that text. I wasn't even awake at... What time does it say? - 3:19. - 3:19 A.M. - I was sleeping. - Oh, so, then what? Some guy snuck into your house, knew what your passcode was and texted me pretending to be you? Maybe, I don't know. - Who's the guy? - It's not anybody. - Don't do this. - I'm not doing anything, 'cause apparently, I can't perform anymore, right? Okay, now you're being mean. Why don't you believe me? Because cell phone technology doesn't lie. Oh, my God, I can't believe this. Look, let's just be real for a second, okay? I know you fell in love with the guy who I used to be... the guy who could run and pick you up and spin you around, and I'm just not that guy anymore. I don't care about that. Tony, I love you. I know it's June right now, but let's just pretend for a minute that it's September. - Don't go there. - You're gonna be in Palo Alto at a big college with lots of guys, and I'm just gonna be sitting here... living with my mom in this frickin' chair. I think about what it would take to get to LAX, get on a plane, and come see you in this chair, and it's next to impossible for me to do that. Let's not kid ourselves. Maybe we should just call it quits now. Maybe this text message was a blessing in disguise. Wow. You sound like you've got it all figured out, don't you? No, but it's probably gonna happen anyway, so... Let's just get it over with. Fine. All right then. Bye. Bye. - Hi! - Hey. - What's the matter? - Nothing. Nothing, come on. I'm your mother, I know that look. What's going on? Jasmine and I broke up. Oh, sweetheart, I'm sorry to hear that. Do you want to talk about it? No, I don't want to talk about it. I'm here if you need me, okay? I don't know, maybe it was tough for her to be around you. What do you mean? Well, you're a constant reminder that she, you know, made a big mistake. It had to be really difficult for her. Personally, I've always thought Jasmine was sort of self-involved. Whatever. It's over. Gotta move on. Can I tell you something? Sure. I want to come over there right now and kiss you. Oh, I know I shouldn't have said that, but I can't help it, I can't stop thinking about you. I don't know what to say. I'm sorry. It's too soon for you and that was totally inappropriate of me to say. Yeah, it was. Should we just forget it? Probably should. Hello? - Hi, Mrs. Fox? - Yes. This is Lena from Dr. Peters' office. I'm just checking to make sure you're still interested in doing the procedure. Yes, yes, we are. I was wondering what was going on. Did you get my message? What message? Last week, I called your home number and I spoke to Tony's caregiver, and I was kind of concerned, because I didn't get a call back. Oh, well, we didn't get the message, so what is the message? Well, we had a spot open up and Tony was on the schedule, but when I didn't get a confirmation, I had to give the date to somebody else. What? We are still very much interested. - Great! - So can we reschedule? Yes, although for now, the next opening isn't until next year. Next year. - Hey, Mom. - Hi, honey. Daphne, can I talk to you in private for a second? Oh, sure! Everything okay? - Why didn't you tell me? - Tell you what? That Dr. Peters' office had called, a spot had opened up for Tony. I'm so sorry. I completely forgot about that. You're sorry? My son had a chance to walk again - and you forgot? - I'm sorry. Honestly, it just slipped my mind. Now he has to wait who knows how long for another shot at this. You have every reason to be upset. But I promise you, it will never happen again. You're damn right it won't. You're fired. Don't you take him from me. Don't take him away from me! Please! Stay away from our brother! I was helping him. Helping him? You need to get back on your meds. He's all I have. You can't do this! You are dead to us. Gary, don't! Hey, you get back here! Hello? Somebody there? Oh! Gotcha, Daphne. I should've never let you go. What the hell is this place? It's my grandfather's. What's it to you? I went to the cops. I told them what you tried to do. But they said that they couldn't do anything. They were like, "Dude, that's your problem. Deal with it." So here I am. I'm dealing with it. You are a tough one to find. Took me a couple months. But you know, when that caregiver service listed your picture online, bingo! Do they know that you go from cripple to cripple baiting these guys like you get off on it? Do they know that you've got a pattern, Daphne? I loved your brother. I was his wife! He said he was gonna leave me! So that is your excuse? Some people are just born crazy. You're one of them. You shouldn't be allowed to take care of people. The fact is, you shouldn't be allowed to walk the earth. God help me. You think you can just get rid of me? After everything I've done for you? You need me. Because I take care of you. You crawl out that door, you're gonna hurt yourself. And I can't have that. This is for your own good. You didn't have to fire her! She's been the only one helping me! Tony, we'll find someone else. Someone with a functioning memory. Like who? Like Mrs. Richardson from down the street! Mrs. Richardson, oh, God. What? What is wrong with her? She used to terrorize me as a kid. Tony, I am working 60 hours a week here, okay? And I have to deal with the fact that my boy is in a wheelchair. So whether you like it or not, I need someone here to help you. I've gotta be on a flight in less than two hours, so just please, don't fight me on this. I'm sorry, Mom. I'm really sorry. Listen, we'll get through this. I made you a turkey sandwich with carrot sticks. Excellent sources of protein and fiber. Okay, cool, thanks. You were supposed to take your medication 45 minutes ago. - Mhm. - Forty-five minutes! I'm sure you will do better in the future. Tony, your medication now. Please! I told your mother I would take good care of you, and that's what I plan to do. I will be in the other room if you need me. I swear it just slipped my mind. I know, my mom told me. Can you forgive me? Of course. Everybody makes mistakes. Is anyone looking after you? Mrs. Richardson. She lives down the street. Is she staying in my room? No, she sleeps at her own house. I can call her if I need her. How's your friends from school? Everybody's either going off to college or going backpacking through Europe. I texted them, but they're like, "Sorry to hear what happened to you," and that's it. It's like they're so uncomfortable talking to me, they just blow me off. Well, if you ask me, the girls at your school aren't old enough to realize how great you are. Look, wheelchair or not, it doesn't matter to me. Thanks for saying that. Can I take you out to dinner tomorrow? Maybe we can go down to Santa Monica and check out the pier. I don't think that's such a good idea. You know, with my mom being so upset and all. I understand. Maybe in a couple months, or so. Okay, sure. I'm gonna go to sleep now. Good night. Hm. What the hell? Tony, Ellen? Anybody home? Oh, my God. Wait! Oh, my God, it's a gas leak. Call the fire department! Please, we need help! He's unconscious. Bring him outside. Quickly! I'm right behind you. Set him down here. Watch his head. It's okay, Tony. It's gonna be okay. Can you shut off the gas? Hey, are you okay? I'm here, Tony. Oh, my God. Tony. - Hi, Mom. - So, how did the gas line get disconnected? Who knows, that dryer rattles all the time. It probably knocked it loose or something. Mom, that's not what's important. Daphne saved my life! Firefighters said I could have died. Why didn't you call Mrs. Richardson? Because I couldn't find my phone. It fell behind the nightstand. Besides, Mrs. Richardson wouldn't have been any help. Daphne, what were you doing at our house? I just thought I'd return some books Tony left in my car, and thought I'd beat the traffic. Talk about luck, huh? Yeah, I'm just glad you're both okay. I think we need to rehire Daphne, Mom. She said she was sorry a thousand times, and this morning she kicked ass. And you already know I can be available 24/7. Mrs. Richardson can't do that. Please, Mom. All right. Daphne, you're back on. You won't regret this, Mrs. Fox. There is no place else I'd rather be than right here with you. Well, what can I say? You saved my life. Hello? Tony, this is Lena from Dr. Peters' office. Hi, Lena! Um, thanks for calling. We had a patient cancel, so there's a spot for you. Really? - When? - Next Thursday, 7:00 A.M. check in. I can get the surgery. Oh! - I'm there. - Fantastic, I'm gonna send a follow-up email that has all the instructions, so as soon as you and your mom read it, call me back. Okay, great. Great, I'll see you on Thursday. Okay, thank you. What's the matter? I gotta admit, I'm worried. It's dangerous. Yeah, but we already talked about the risks. But it could elevate your pain levels. Or, you could die on the table. I almost died in the damn laundry room because I couldn't use my legs, right? I mean, I'll take my chances. Good morning! How ya doin', bud? Ready to rock n' roll, doc. I have good news, the procedure I developed just got approved by the FDA. Wow, that's great, that means you can help more people, right? Yeah, but unfortunately the way government works it'll be months before it becomes common practice, so for now I am still the only spinal surgeon in the developed world who can perform this type of surgery. Well, we can't thank you enough. Of course. I'm gonna go to my office, and then scrub in, and the nurses should be by to take you to the OR in about 30 minutes. Okay, sounds good! - Okay. - Big day! Mom, chill. I got this. - Dr. Peters? - Yeah. Hi, who are you? I'm Phoebe from the lab. We took another look at Tony's blood tests. Are you sure you can operate with his white cell count so low? What? That's gotta be a mistake. No, these numbers are fine. When'd you take these tests? His white cell count is right where it should be. Blood oxygen looks good. Look at this, the rest of the numbers are terrific. Those guys in the lab can't get it right. The hell'd you do? You're not gonna take him from me. Code blue, code blue, 33, code blue. What's all that about? I don't know. What is it, what happened? Dr. Peters has had what appears to be a heart attack... - What? - And he's passed. I'm so sorry. Hey, how are you doing? It could have been worse. He could have had his heart attack in the middle of the operation. Think about that. You might have died. I'd be better off dead. Don't say that. Hey. Hey. How are you? Tony, you awake? Um, don't come in here. I made you some... I'll go talk to her. Ellen. This is a total ethics violation. Let me explain. I trusted you. I let you into my home to care for my son. You, a woman in your 30s. You think this is appropriate, sleeping with a boy - in your care? - He's not a boy, and he's old enough to make his own decisions. I'll be the judge of that. The state ward will be the judge of that. With all due respect, he's 18 years old. He's more mature than you know, especially with what's happened to him. - I want you out of my house. - You saw how miserable he was! The other night, he was suicidal. - I'm making him happy. - Out! I love him, and he loves me. It didn't start this way, but this is the way it is now. Leave my house before I call the police. None of the girls at school return my texts. No one my age wants to date a cripple. Daphne loves me for who I am, and I love her! You know what, you can spin this however you wish, but I won't accept it. Then I'll move in with her. I will. - I can do what I want. - No, don't be ridiculous. Daphne's the only person who's made me feel happy since the accident. Please, don't move in with her. This is your home. Fine. But I'm gonna keep seein' her. There ya go, come on! Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about! That's right, that's it! I like it, I like it. That's it, yeah! Look, Jasmine, it's my job to keep Kyle safe. - Kyle? - I mean Tony. Kyle was my last client. You got a tattoo of the name of your client? Thanks for hangin' out with me today. Mm. Sure you don't want to spend the night at my place? I shouldn't. My mom's been really freakin' out lately. - I should go. - All right, I'll be at my place if you change your mind. Kyle, where are you, Kyle? Daphne Edwards. Hi, Daphne Jones. Hey, what are you doing? Well, I know we just saw each other, but I miss you! Yes, already. Guess where I am right now. Come on, guess. In my bed. Guess what I'm wearing. Nothing. Mm, okay, maybe I'm still wearing my panties, but that's all. I wish you were here with me. Oh, come on, don't act like you're embarrassed. You like it when I talk like this. Did you other girlfriends talk like this? Did Jasmine call you up in the middle of the afternoon and talk to you this way? Of course she didn't 'cause she's a girl, she's not a woman. She didn't know how to take care of her man, now did she? But I do. You like it when I take care of you, don't you, baby? Oh, that's my teapot! So, when can I see you again? Mhm. Oh, that would be great. And maybe this time you can spend the night. Hello? Hi, is this Kyle Edwards? - Yes. - My name is Jasmine, and I'm trying to locate a woman by the name of Daphne Edwards. Are you related to her by any chance? Wrong number. Okay, well, thank you very much... Okay. - Hello? - Hi, is this Kyle Edwards? Yes. My name is Jasmine, and I'm trying to locate a woman by the name of Daphne Edwards. By any chance, are you related to her? Okay, sweetie, I'm off to the airport. I'll see you on Tuesday. Have a good trip. You planning on seeing Daphne while I'm gone? Probably, yes. I don't want her in this house. - Hello? - Hi, is this Kyle Edwards? Yeah, who wants to know? My name is Jasmine, and I'm trying to locate a woman by the name of Daphne Edwards. Do you know her by any chance? Yeah, I know her. I have nothing to do with her anymore. - Don't call here again. - Hold on, sir, I just wanna learn a little about her... Hello? Hello? Can I help you? Kyle Edwards? I'm Jasmine, we talked on the phone? You don't quit, do you? Look, I told you I don't want anything to do with her anymore, - so just leave me alone. - Wait! Just hear me out. Daphne's my boyfriend's caregiver, and ever since she's been coming around him, weird things have been happening. I just wanna learn more about her. Please? All right, come on. I was working construction when I fell off a building. Daphne read the news article about me. Just called up outta the blue. Same thing she did with Tony. It's a pattern for her. She's nuts... you know, your boyfriend should stay the hell away from her. What makes you say that? She took care of me for a year and a half. We, we started sleeping together. Bad idea. We, uh, got married. Even worse idea. A little while after that, I realized she was gonzo... so I told her she needed to leave. She didn't like that. You think you can get rid of me after everything I've done for you? I'm your wife, we love each other! You need me because I take care of you. - Get off of me! - You crawl out that door, you're gonna hurt yourself, and I can't have that. I'm gonna remove your arms now, so you can't ever crawl away from me again. This is for your own good. Mona, Gary, how nice of you to stop by. She should be in jail. My brother went looking for her, but I haven't heard from him. Anyway... that's Daphne for ya. - What's up? - I know I'm not supposed to call you, but I had to. Daphne is not who she says she is. Okay, look, you're startin' to see other guys. Don't get all jealous just because I'm seein' Daphne now. This isn't about that! Her name isn't Daphne Jones. It's Daphne Edwards. What are you talkin' about? Remember the day that she called you Kyle? Yeah, so? So, that Japanese tattoo on her arm? You can look it up online, it stands for Kyle. Kyle Edwards, her ex-husband! I tracked him down. He told me terrible things about her. Hey, it's me! So, she's been married before, I mean, who cares? All ex-husbands bag on their ex-wives. She tried to dismember him! What? She beat him, she tried to chop his arms off. This is what the guy told me, I'm not makin' this up. I saw the photos of you guys online. I know you're infatuated with her, but she's dangerous. You need to stay away from her, you've gotta believe me. Hey. I kept the key. Don't tell your mom. Hello? Are you there? Who was that? Oh, uh, telemarketer. I'm gonna make us a salad. Great. So, that, um, tattoo on your arm... what does it stand for? Oh, this? I got it when I was younger. It's Chinese, and it stands for peace and love. Why? It's Japanese, actually, and it stands for Kyle. I don't know what you're talking about. Kyle Edwards, your ex-husband? Does that make you Daphne Jones or Daphne Edwards? Jasmine called me. Oh, Jasmine. I shoulda known. She talked to a Kyle Edwards, and he told her what you tried to do to him. I can't believe this. You listen to Jasmine after everything I've done for you. You never wanted me to get that surgery. You lost that message on purpose, didn't you? I've dedicated myself to you... I love you. What'd you do to Dr. Peters? And this is what I get? Did you kill him? I love you, and you don't love me, do you? You're just like all of the others. You never care about me! Do you? Daphne, I think you should leave now. You think I should leave? No, you don't tell me what to do. I tell you what to do. You wanna know why? Because I'm your caregiver, and that's my job! Hey! Ugh! Why'd you hang up on me? You were right about her. - Can you get me outta here? - Yes, on my way. Get off that phone! Tony, hello? Don't you crawl away from me, Kyle! You're crazy! You can't leave me, you can't! You can't, you can't! You can't leave me. You can't, you can't! I can't. Move! Tony! Tony! Mrs. Fox, it's Jasmine. I think Tony's in trouble. Oh, thank God you caught me, I was about to board my flight. Tony sounded so scared when I talked to him. He begged me to come get him, and then... - I think I heard fighting. - I've been trying to call him. - He's not answering his phone. - That's because he doesn't have his phone. I found it in the street. You found it in the str... Mrs. Fox, he doesn't even have his chair. I think she kidnapped him. I'm calling the police. All right, all right. No, officer, I'm not giving you attitude, I'm just a little disappointed in L.A.'s finest right now. Thank you for your time. What'd they say? They said it's too soon to file a missing persons report, and they can't do an APB on somebody who hasn't done something. Yeah, but she tried to chop up her husband. They have no record of it. I told them that they were in a relationship, and they think they're probably off on some romantic weekend getaway. This is crazy, I can't believe they won't do anything. I know, we're gonna have to find him ourselves. Yeah, right. If she kidnapped him, she won't just be taking him back to her house. Welcome home, my love. That sure sounds like something she'd do. I told you he should stay away from her. Did she ever do anything like this before? Kidnap somebody? Not that I know of. Do you have any idea where she might take him? Not at all, like I told you, I have no idea where she is these days. Okay, well, thanks for your help. Sure thing. Wait, are you there? Yeah. I just remembered, her grandfather left her this piece of property in his will, this funky house up in the mountains. It was some kind of hippie retreat back in the '60s. Do you have an address? Oh, my God, oh, my God. Help me! Help! Help me, help me! Help! Help, help! Help me! Help me! Hey, hey, help, help! Aw, good morning, my love. It's time for breakfast. Scream all you want. We're miles away from the nearest highway. Nobody can hear you. What are you doing? Isn't it nice we're all alone? No one can bother us out here. Please untie me. Relax, open wide. You need your strength for what happens next. You're not gonna get away with this. You're goin' to jail, you know that, right? Now Kyle, don't say things like that. - It's not nice. - I'm not Kyle! We are not gonna play this game today! Now, open your mouth, sweetie. Oh, come on. Please let me go. I can't. If I let you go, you could hurt yourself. It's a big world out there. You need to be with your caregiver, so she can look after you. Besides, you don't really wanna leave me, do you, Kyle? Daphne... look at me. I'm Tony. Yeah, that's it. The drugs have you a little confused, but that's all. You should rest. It's a big day today. Wait. No. No! No, no, no, no, help me! Help! Go around the back. I'll check down here. Okay, got it. Ellen? - Tony? - Jasmine, I'm in here! Oh, my God! Hurry, untie me! Have you seen Daphne? I don't know, you didn't see her? No. - I can't, it's too tight. - Get a knife. In the kitchen, there's gotta be a knife. - I got it. - Good, cut me loose. Jasmine, look out! Okay, bitch. No, no, Jasmine! Okay, where were we? Oh, yes, appendage removal. I'll be right back, sweetie. Somebody help us! Somebody, no, Jasmine! - Okay. - No, no, no. - This is gonna smart a little. - No, no! Don't worry, sweetie, it'll be over before you know it. Daphne, baby, it's me, Kyle. I won't leave you. I promise. I love you. I love you, too! Sweetheart, hold on, sweetie, I got you. I got you. You're okay. It's okay. - I'm worried. - Relax, Mom. They say this new doctor is a protégé of Dr. Peters, really knows his stuff. Go get 'em, baby. Ready! Set! Go! - Come on, sweetheart! - Come on, come on, baby, - come on, come on! - Come on, sweetheart!
