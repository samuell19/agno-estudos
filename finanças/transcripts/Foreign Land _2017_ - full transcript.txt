I really love the winter, although here it's much harder than where I come from. From the window of my new home I learn something I'd almost forgotten, that there are four seasons in a year and winter is the prettiest of all. Here I got hooked on nature, on the silence, on the flow of water in the creek… And I even recognize every deer that comes up to my house and stares at me in curiosity. Wow! This is so different than the life I had until a few years ago. Shiomi, my God... Who was hurt, Abuelaish? My daughters, my God... What do I have left? My God. He has eight children he protected throughout the war in his house in Beit La hi a, Gaza. Wake up my sweetheart. My God Wake up my sweetheart. My God We kept in to'uch"tPiroughout, and as we were speaking I got this'phon'e'call, a shell struck his house and I have't'o'say, I don't know how to hang up niv. Ii ip'ii and I refuse to hang up. My daughters have'been killed! My God! My daughters have been killed My God! My God! What can I say? What kind of life is this? I wanted to devote my life to them, I lost my wife just four months ago and I had to devote my life to my daughters so they could build a future. My God... Good evening. I am Izzeldin Abuelaish, a Palestinian from the Jabalia Refugee Camp-. What can I do? Didn't have a choice. If I had a choice I'd choose Switzerland or Australia. Or Washington. Three years after the war in Gaza actor Gassan Abbas invited me to watch the play "I Shall Not Hate" based on the book by my friend Dr. Izzeldin Abuelaish. They brought me a text… And the text was strange. Why strange? I didn't really understand it, don't understand the character. They kill his three daughters and his niece… And he stil… Talks about peace and hangs onto that notion named peace. I'd understand him if he were angry, I'd understand him if he were furious, I'd understand him if, two, three, four years later he started speaking about peace and saying: I want my daughters to be the last victims. That I could understand. But his daughters' blood hadn't yet dried and he's talking about peace. I want you to solve that riddle for me. I had no answer. I too asked that question, but at that meeting Gassan and I discovered that we were both at a similar crossroads in our lives. Those were the days. - You were stars. - Yes. Couldn't walk down the street. I didn't dare walk down the street in the daytime. Abu Elhakem, I'm sitting with a beautiful rich girl. The flower of the city. T's so innocent and.. Pure. I don't think anyone would watch it today. Something's changed. The good Arab guy, the nice human being, doesn't exist anymore. Like your reports. People don't want to see them. That's why you quit and went elsewhere. You quit one place, you left another place, this one doesn't speak your language anymore and neither does that one. You're talking about me? I'm talking about you and me. Me, too. On the shelves of the Israel Television archives lie, side by side, Gassan's past and my past. I'm in the Brazil neighborhood And here behind me Israeli army bulldozers are tearing up the street. I covered Palestinian affairs for over 20 years. The Gaza Strip, the peace process and its collapse, ntifadas, wars. But mostly I told stories of people's suffering. T"hat was my job. I felt I was making a difference, or at least touching viewers. But then something happened. Hamas took power in Gaza , Israel imposed a closure, missiles were fired at Israel, and eventually TV viewers didn't want to hear about life beyond the checkpoints any more. They remember one thing from my whole career was the reporter who cried on live TV over the killing of my friend's daughters, Dr. Izzeldin Abuelaish from Gaza and as Israelis were fighting there, The doctors, your friends here in the Israeli hospital where you work, embraced you. As if you belong and don't belong. You're from Gaza but you're like an Israeli. You're Israeli but you're Gazan. I can tell you that I'm a proud Palestinian but I have one foot in Gaza and one in Israel and that's what I wanted to provide an example of coexistence. When I was in the Israeli hospital, "Soroka" Hospital, everyone knew the Palestinian doctor and the patients would say, "We want Izzeldin." I'm a doctor, an infertility specialist. There was a time when I delivered mere' Israeli babies than any other doctor. I worked in Israel for many years, rented an apartment in the city♪.®f feeersheva-, then in Ramat Gan, not far'frj®mK'the z®®-. For many years Tel Aviv was my home. Two of my children were born here. But the straw that broke the camel's back and made me leave Tel Aviv was that my two children used to go to the park with their mother sometimes and play there… And one day they were playing with two Jewish kids… And the Jewish kids' grandmother heard them speaking Arabic and she started to scream and curse. "What is this? A zoo? Where have I brought my grandchildren?" That day I decided we would leave Tel Aviv… And I started building a house in Umm Al-Fahm. Although Tel Aviv... look. It's prettier than Umm Al-Fahm. It's more pleasant. This is the border-of Umm Al-Fahm and over there, that's supposedly Palestine. These are the occupied territories. They're Palestinians and we're Palestinians but they turned us into two different nations. You were born before the Six Day War before the territories were occupied. Yes. Yes. They told me, "You're Israeli." Yes, and they granted me Israeli citizenship. Because you were born in Israel, not across the border. You're an Arab Israeli. I'm an Israeli Jew and you're an Israeli Arab. And you make me laugh. Why? What's so funny? Because Israel should be here, in your heart. Israel should be in your veins. The word "Israel" should mean something to you. When you hear "Israel you should feel a thrill" I don't feel anything. I don't belong. The Israelis don't want me. I was also born before the Six-Day War. When the IDF held the victory parade in Jerusalem we were glued to our TV sets with tremendous excitement and our national pride soared sky high. Every time we saw the face of Defense Minister Moshe Dayan or Chief of Staff Yitzhak Rabin we shouted "hurrah" and applauded. How could I have known that 50 years later the results of that war would tear Israeli society to pieces? Rabin was assassinated, Israel has changed, and anyone who doesn't toe the right-wing line is suspected of disloyalty. Now in on Israel's Independence Day, I put up the national flag in my backyard. After all, I don't want to offend the neighbors. But it makes me feel good, it eases my conscience about not being there. I found this flag in an Israeli settlement after Israel withdrew from Gaza and evacuated its settlements there. I filmed hundreds of Palestinians plundering the synagogue, taking whatever they could. T's now 10:30, Palestinians entered the synagogue three hours ago. "Happy New Year!" The flag was taken out of the rubble by a Palestinian boy. It was covered in sand and dust I've had it ever since, Even in America. O» -f r ' ■ r.r; > 1. Our conflict is with the Arab world. It's a conflict with the Arab states, a conflict with the Palestinians and a conflict with the Israeli Arabs. If you live in this country you must be loyal to the state. When I was in first grade, I think, they put a crown on my head, and set up a stage, and I went on stage on the Israeli Independence Day, Israeli flags all over the school... "Umm Al-Fahm School. Celebrates Israel's 24th Independence Day" and I sang before Moshe Dayan , "Our Independence Day" but I didn't understand what I was singing. "On our Independence Day "the bird in the valley began to sing "and the water flowed" and all sorts of nonsense. They fed us. And Moshe Dayan sat in the first row, I remember it as if it were today. I told my father. 41. I remember that he cried. 41 But he didn't say a word. The lunch box. "-The lunch box is here." Isn't that your bus? Don't you find it strange that they make you salute the flag every morning. They never said "you have to do this." I remember about two years ago there was a teacher who made kids stand at attention. Some kids refused and there was trouble. After all, the school was full of Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, all the religions. And that's why they refused to stand at attention. They said it isn't who they are. - Do you sing the national anthem? - No. -No? - I don't even stand at attention. - Why not? Because I don't think I should stand at attention for a flag, of any country. Do you realize how my parents dreamt \ Do you realize ho, w-my parents dreamt 'of having a Jewish state? My parents who came'from an Arab country, from Iraq. My parents who came from an Arab country, from Iraq. What do you say about that? It doesn't bother me that people say 1't's not what you say, it's what I'm saying, that we confused you. I-say they wanted it because they experienced so much hatred that they said, "I want a good place of my own." - Well, have a good day. - You, too. I see the change he's going through, from an Israeli boy to an American teen. He has learned English very quickly, nonchalantly throws around slang that I can't always understand, and, mainly' he fits ig, mnake's♪ffiends, and not just Israeli ones. Tie's gradually tmgrg iriit® a native while I still feel foreign and alienated. Father and son, but each of us feels he belongs to a different place. From now on, Israel's students will learn the whole Jewish-Zionist story. Hundreds of students guarded by soldiers drive through the outskirts of Nablus up to Mt. Ebal. Now schools can visit hundreds of sites beyond the '67 borders. The clear-cut agenda is to erase the '67 borders with our feet. Friends, I consider the study of Judaism ajiid excelling at it, more important than' tht study of mathematics and science. And excelling at it, more important than the study of mathematics and science. There was a teacher in Umm Al-Fahm named Yusef Abu-Hussein who taught Hebrew. For every mistake we made in Hebrew… With the leg of a chair… Two blows here and two blows here. More than three mistakes, you'd grab the bench with two kids holding you and get your butt caned. He told us why he beat us for making mistakes in Hebrew. He said, "In this country, whoever doesn't know Hebrew" "cannot be a breadwinner." "Learn Hebrew." I got a "B" in the Bible Studies matriculation exam. I studied Bialik, Yehuda Ha'Levi, Tchernichovsky. That's what they taught us, so I know Hebrew fluently. - Hello. - Hello. - I'm a poet. -Hello. - Hello. My name is Eyal and I'm a poet. The^ say that every poet is formed ip the image of King ©avid. I live off my poetry. Can I offer you ten lovely poems for ten Israeli Shekels? I have here poems that Shakespeare would've been proud to write. T's true. Or Fernando Pessoa. Let me give you an example. "When I came to Earth I crossed the borders of time." - My problem is... - Yes? - I don't read Hebrew well. - You can't read Hebrew? - You can't read Hebrew well? - No. You didn't learn to read Hebrew? But you've been in this country for years, why didn't you learn to read Hebrew? I learned Arabic in the Intelligence Corps. They taught us to spy on Arab countries. I learned perfect Arabic, - -To spy? - To spy on Arab countries. Listen, the Arabs want to kill us.- Yeah, Sure. ♪ What can I do? It's true, what can I do? Ladies and gentlemen, a red alert has been sounded throughout Tel Aviv. Please go into buildings and take cover in a safe place. Put your hands on your heads! Don't worry, we'll intercept it. °a I. Don't worry, we'll intercept it. A rough day for Israeli troops, 13 Golani Brigade soldiers fell in bloody combat in central Gaza. Exactly a year after I arrived in the U.S. another wanbroke out. I pray that you aren't in pain, my brother, that you aren't unhappy and that nothing can hurt you anymore. It was the third war between Israel and Gaza in six years and my first war that I watched from far away on a screen. Missiles were fired at Israel, dozens of civilians and soldiers were killed and entire neighborhoods in Gaza were razed to the ground and thousands were killed and wounded. From afar I saw the process of radicalization on both sides, Hamas was willing to fight to the end, To sacrifice civilians in order to remain in power, to maintain its rule. While Israeli politicians competed over who would stretch the boundaries of .hatred furthest only to garner more votes' who would stretch the boundaries of hatred furthest only to garner more votes. Ashkelon mayor Itamar Shimoni has ordered that the Arab-Israeli workers in Ashkelon kindergartens be suspended due to the security situation... In the Habima Theater's production of "The Good Soldier Schweik" which premiered last night at the Ashkelon Cultural Center actor Gassan Abbas refused to bow to the audience since Mayor Itamar Shimoni was in the hall. - How's it going? - Fine. How are you - All right. - Wow! Long time no see. - Yes. This war in Gaza, every single radio and TV station called me wanting to interview me. If I had dared to speak up. I would've have been kicked out of Habima Long ago, out of Habima. Just because I refused to bow to one fascist the management has severed ties with me. They barely say hello, they don't say hello, and when they pass by they walk away. And that's awful. Instead of backing me up… You ostracize me? Not only that, any actor who showed solidarity, or who they suspected of showing solidarity with me, was called in for a hearing upstairs. And this is supposed to be the great theater which should be humane and artistic... And I didn't know what to do. Some people told me: Izzeldin, you're delivering a new generation of occupiers. 18 years from now, all these cute little babies hugging their mothers and nursing milk from their breasts will come burn your house down. The tanks and jets will come and torch all of Gaza. What will you say then? But the situation in Israel wasn't easy either. "You killed my son shouted the husband of a patient who was suffering from a hemorrhage. "Why do they let an Arab from Gaza work here?" "They blow up our buses and we give them jobs." I think something's going to attack me any second. The one with the wings is out to get me. Do you feel at home here? To be honest, I have a problem, I don't feel at home anywhere. Oco. I have this feeling that I was born in the wrong place at the wrong time. That no matter where I go I'm a foreigner, I'm not at home be it in Israel, be it here, be it any country in the world. I've never belonged. My son went to Manchester a month ago and1 that was after he was going home from wor, k the police grabbed him. "Where are you from?" "From Umm Al-Fahm." They beat him up. - Beat him up? - Yes. Yes. "When he told me Tm leaving," I gave him my permission immediately. Immediately. If I love my son and I want him to have a good future, he should leave. He should be far away. If it's a little hard for me… J.t's fine, it's alright. To keep him here would be selfish and... It's good for me I like having him near me, that's what my father wanted to do to me. That's why we say that we're mad at our fathers and our fathers are mad at our grandfathers. Don't want him to be mad at me. He's my landlord. They're Jews, English Jews, and when I pay rent he thinks I'm Israeli since^rhave an Israeli passport. He doesn't know I'm an Arab 'and it's better this way. Why? I-don't think it would make a.difference, but... you know don't know. It's better. You grew up in Tel Aviv and you endedjjp here with the-dews, too. Yeah. More or less. % 3 I didn't really leave because of the police and all that. That didn't really bother me. I got used to it somehow. I'm not saying that every time ran into a cop we got into a fight, No, it was't like that but I had a few traumatic incidents where I got beaten up for nothing. He said "Give me your ID," I said "Here," and for some reason I got beaten up. And then they make you sign a piece of paper that says nobody touched you. - Did you sign? - No, never. I went to Tel Aviv with two friends, we went to a restaurant, one went in, the second went in, I was about to go in when the guy says "hold on." He heard my accent. He goes, "You can't come in." I asked why? He shrugs his shoulders. I asked, "Why can't I come in?" And I cracked up for about five minutes, I couldn't stop laughing hysterically, it was so funny. He had no reason not to let me in. That night, at home, I thought about it and Shiomi, I nearly cried. I nearly cried. Why? Why? Where we're going to eat now… Neither of us can say where we come from or-what language we speak. - \Ne have something in common. - Yeah. If they ask where we're from, let's say from Estonia. You're an actor like your dad. - Did you want to be an actor? - Yes. But to be honest.. If I decide to be a famous actor one day I'd rather be famous not here, in Israel. Yes. - -Why? - I don't know. Don't know. Say hello to your father, Moishe. 11 years ago I gave you my son, a Muslim Arab. His name is Muhammad Kadir, not Moshe. I don't want a Jewish son, madam, my health can't handle it. I have nothing against the Jews, may God forgive them. I was a victim of persecution all my life, madam, and I have documents to prove I was a victim of persecution. You were a victim of persecution? Are you sure you aren't Jewish? I'm-a stranger to both sides. Ask rffii. E-who my'friends In Umm Al-Fahm are? I have none. Who do I hang out with? Who do I go to cafes with? Nobody. We have nothing in common. I lived here in Tel Aviv for 25 years… And when I decided to move back to the village, to Umm Al-Fahm, to the warmth, to the bosom that would embrace me… I found that the village was not the same place I'd left and the people had totally have changed. Didn't know anyone. There are mere mosques than schools and that's sad. Does Allah want illiterates praying to him? No, he doesn' Here, from here to here, was the counter where we sold tickets, and on this side was the lighting and sound. I don't know if you remember, but I came to your theater once. - Could be. - Don't you remember? The truth is: So many people came because it was an attraction, a theater in Umm Al-Fahm. "God, save me from my country." Why did was theater shut down? First of all, the Muslim Brotherhood here, the Islamic movement runs the city and they destroy everything they don't like. They threatened to torch the theater and they threatened'people not to come, and unfortunately the stupid leftist liberals of Umm Al-Fahm would come up the stairs and look around to make sure no one saw them as if they were going to... who knows what. The fea. People told me, "Gassah« ♪ stop speaking out against them." They abandoned their culture, their language, their folklore, their literature. It isn't the Islam of my father or my mother. It's something new. \Ne had good times heT.e. Every evening, there was a play or a concert or a movie. ““Hat's all over now. I don't know how much I improved my English', but in college with students I from around the world ft I I♪- I I have learned new things. For the first time in my life I felt what it's like to be a minority. Here I'm not one of the Chosen People here, I'm just an immigrant. The second thing is that here you don't ask people. About their religion. It's considered really mean. But I also learned things about myself. For example, that I'm no longer young and starting a new career isn't in the cards. Students in the class used to look with amazement at this strange creature who always sat in the front row and had trouble understanding what was going on. But what surprised me most is that the Americans, x other than democracy and human rights, teach'andsencourage another important ideal in their textbooks making money is considered a truly patriotic act. Well, in addition to English, I still have a lot to learn. And... action! What? What, what? They tasted the humus and licked their fingers. The first time we'did that commercial they recreated "The Big Restaurant" down to the last detail. You don't look like you're enjoying this. T's whaf they call "making a living." You know, I had a dream the other day… That I was driving a tractor, It was weird… And my son Nadim was sitting on the rung of the tractor holding on.. But he was a three-year-old boy with blond hair to his shoulders like wheni he was a child and I say t® him, "NadimjSe eareful", "give me your hand. C@me on up." He say^s, "No, no, no. I want to sit here." The next morning I woke up and thought, "What a dream." He's 21 years old, I still see him probably as a baby… Want t® wateh over him and if he falls, to teach him how to get back up. I boxed up all my things. 'S a big mess. The situation isn't the greatest. I'm not doing great financially and it looks like I'll have to move to a more modest place. It's a lousy feeling. I feel bad about myself and all I can think about is what my parents are thinking. I imagine they're disappointed and I wish myself luck in my new place. My brothers and sisters, there's a great positive spirit here. The spirit of the people ©J Israel, the Jewish spirit, the Zionist spirit, our spirit. Hurrah Bibi!! Hurrah Bibi!! Today you are going to the front, to a holy war, a war of the children of light against the children of darkness. We started a little late today because of the demonstration. Did you see the people at the demonstration? No, I came early, I was afraid I wouldn't be able to get in. - Hey, buddy. Are you the radioman? - Yes. - What's your name? - Gudarski. Radioman Gudarski, I'm supposed to describe your death in battle. They asked me: Why aren't you going to the demonstration? As a joke. I said I'm going to the demonstration after the show. They were afraid of provocations. "Don't talk to anyone there." S it a big crowd there? - Yes. - Yes. - Were you there? - Yes. Is it worth going. - Platoon 11. - Yes, sir. - Platoon 11. - Yes, sir! We are now going to war to defend the homeland for the Emperor's sake. For the Emperor's sake! We are the iron fist which holds the flower of life! For the Emperor's sake! For the Emperor's sake! On the way to Rabin Square where Rabin was assassinated more than two decade ago I wondered how Gassan felt once he didn't dare walk the street for fear of being mobbed by loving fans and now I was afraid he'd be recognized as an Arab. I won't deny that I didn't want to be recognized, either. Together Only Baruch Marzel can force an order. Did they fired you from the TV show. Yeah? Did they kick you off. Yeah? Let's go, this is depressing, very depressing. The only time I was here before the night when'Rabin was assassinated. That night he was assassinated… • "We right wing government is in danger" "Arab voters are coming out in droves to the polls." "The leftist organizations a're'bussing them in." "Go out'and vote, bring'your friends and relatives," "and with your help and God's help" "we'll form a national government that will protect the State of Israel." Bibi, Bibi! Against all odds we've scored a great victory for the "Likud" party. Bibi is a magician... The magic is yours. "Culture Minister Miri Regev is planning an amendment to the law" requiring of artists a declaration of loyalty before they receive government support. This doesn't exist in enlightened countries and it's not clear what the loyalty is to. It's not a question of freedom of expression, It's a question of freedom of funding. Art is not the property of one side or the other. Not of the right, nor of the left. We're doomed if art, too, falls victim to dangerous politicization by one side or the other. The "Yedioth" and "Haaretz" newspapers are in trouble. Channel 1(? Is in trouble, all the media is in trouble. Since the founding of the state, the left has run the media and other hubs of power undemocratically. This is a slippery slope To ypr-y. Dangerous places. In the US it was McCarthy, McCarthyism. I want to'thank everyone who has worked here over the years. Many sad moments, and many happy moments, and in the end many people are beihg sent home. The leftist media has been mobilized for a Bolshevik witch hunt and character assassination of myselfrand my family. They create a landslide of lies about us, what we call "fake news." No, no, we won't let Channel 10 go off the air. When my colleagues fought for their independence and livelihoods was no longer in Israel. I applied to a research institute in Washington and decided to leave. But although I should have felt safe and sound I was haunted by a terrible sepse of an opportunity missed'. In Israel "peace" had become a dirty word and fear served as an effective weapon. For killing any chance of conciliation. Very soon the enemies were no longer only the neighbors beyond the border, the enemy was anyone who refused to give up hope, and the abrasive currents were only intensifying. I, who was born in Israel and grew up there, saw for the first time in my life harbingers of a different war, different and more dangerous than all the wars in the past an internal, culture war within Israeli society. The show "I Shall Not Hate" wasjoancelled. That's life. We couldn't draw an audience to this show. So much work and only ten performances. Ten performances, yes. What a shame. What a shame. A play about a Palestinian doctor who lost his daughters but says "I shall not hate" was a total flop, but an anti-war satire, "The Good Soldier Svejk", was a smash hit with Israeli audiences. The Israeli audience… I have a feeling… Is unaware of the situaion it's in. People don't want to listen, they don't want to know, they want to live for the moment. They live in a very dangerous situation. They send their children to war every two years. Every two years this soldier prepares himself for the next war. War is picnic? It's dangerous. You put your life on the line. Why not try to solve the problem? Send the message from the Palestinian doctor from the Jabaliya refugee camp who was born there and raised and worked with all of his heart, with all of his sincere will, I'm a messenger of peace. "You had weapons in your house." - I've very sorry. - It hurts, what do you think? What are you thinking? I'm sorry, but this hurts. We also have families their children were killed I won't leave. My son is in the paratroops, who knows what you had in your house? Even then it was hard for the Israeli audience to accept the fact that Israeli soldiers killed innocent civilians and all the messages of peace by the doctor from Gaza who had lost his daughters just hours earlier was rudely silenced. Here in the hospital where his children are being treated. Shame on you. Such voices then were few and far between, but by the time Habima put on the play, another war had already broken out and the threats to Israel's cultural institutions only increased. Nowadays people are afraid and everyone's worried about their positions and their jobs and... You can't talk the way you could a few years ago. They have now started to'threaten artists. Artists are like doctors and nurses at a hospital. It used to be said "nurses are angels". Artists are angels. Authors are angels, poets are angels. If there is a Paradise, they don't question them bufjhe. Y open the Paradise gates for them. There, they don't have to account for themselves. I'd like to be an Arab, a Palestinian, an actor, as it should be… In a civilized society, a society free of violence. Peace. Silence, silence, silence... Birds. Lately, every time we meet, I find Gassan angrier, - more desperate. - Yes. I'm angry at myself, too. I'm angry at myself for having children. I love them very much, very much, I'd give my own eyes for them. But it was selfish of me to bring them into this world. If I could go back 25 years wouldn't have had them. What for? Where did I bring them to? Where? What kind of world? Nadim asked me several times: "Why did you have me? What for?" - Nadim! - What? I never thought I'd film you doing construction work in Israel. I didn't either, but... Whatever. Actually like... not this type of work, but I like work where I have to think and then use my hands, because it's enjoyable when you see all the walls I plastered all these walls. - -Really? - Yeah. It makes you proud, you say, wow, I did this. I still get a thrill out of it but there are people who. Ive been doing it for 35 years and they don't care. They just want to go home and get through the month. The situation is deteriorating rapidly. I'm not afraid of what's happened so far, I'm afraid of what's going to happen here. How does your dad feel about you coming back? I don't know how to put it, he. I think he'd rather they would be coming to visit me. When you see him fighting with his back against the wall feel sorry for him. Feel sorry for him. I keep telling him, "Enough. Sell the house," "let's get out of here... let's get out of here." "We can't go on like this." He says, "I can't start from scratch", "I'm not a kid, 'm not going to sell the house" "and move somewhere else, it's hard to start over again." Don't know. Tried. Hi, can I take your order? Hello, I would like a vanilla milkshake, medium... - Sir, a medium vanilla milkshake? - Yes. - Anything else, sir? - And one vanilla ice cream in a cone. Sometimes people ask my name and out of experience I answer: S-H-L-O-M-I, but when I want to make it easier on everyone I confidently reply: John! When they call out the name "John" that I adopted I forget that the fabricated identity I invented is really the imaginary me. America can be comfortable, even luxurious, I have a big new car, a comfortable house and a huge yard with no fences. But all that doesn't ease the loneliness. I soon realized the Americans would never be my friends, true friends. We didn't go to college or serve in the army together. I'll always be foreign to them. I know Israelis who've lived here for 30 years. They look for the news every hour on the hour. A habit from home. This is Mike, wait, don't tell me, the N.RR. News quiz, you Ta But I have developed a thinking game that I'm going to patent internationally. It's called "S-H-L-O-M-I Goes Home and What Would Happen If," and to make it more exciting I add an original soundtrack for the film running through my head. "Oh my land, my birthplace, A bald rocky mountain." Kid and lamb faint with thirst, Golden citrus rejoices...” Death to the Arabs, death to the Arabs! Jews are heart and soul, leftists are sons of bitches! Hope your village burns down! May your children be killed in an accident May your children die! No more democracy and morality! It's bleeding us dry! Take your camera and go home! Get it into your head! Only Jews belong here, only Jews! Death to the leftists! Two months ago. I had a heart attack. - Really? - Yes. They took me by ambulance to Afula for catheterization. An dr... All the while, my wife and'my daughte… Kept trying to call me… And I tell thje guy who's treating me to answer want to tell them that I don't want.. A wake, I don't want you t® hold a wa'ke for me. That's what I was«thinking. I hear them saying... "Don't fall asleep, don't fall asleep stay with us, stay with us" and I say, I'm sure I didn't say it aloud, but I told them,"Leave me alone, enough, I'm tired, I'm tired "I want to sleep. Leave me alone." And they gave me an electric shock because I had cardiac arrest. Death doesn't scare me. I know it's near. But there are things I want to do before it comes. What? I'd like to get out of here, to have time to get out of here before that… And I would really not want to die here. Not here. Anywhere in the world but here. Because the people here… Are impure, I don't want them to touch me. Don't want them to touch me. I want to get out of here and never come back. "Bon appetit," says Mrs. Naomi. Mrs. Naomi, whrat's that? "That's ground meat." And that? "That's ground fish." Isn't that a waste of good food? Everything's ground up. No wonder the Jews are violent. They're frustrated.

A shell in the girls' room. I run to their room. Mayar is lying on the floor, decapitated. Abuelaish brought his children to see Gassan Abbas portray his life story on stage. I run outside to call for help but the soldiers are out there, suddenly another shell hits the girls' room. Bissan, Bissan, Bissan where are you? Tell me so I can help you. They killed my daughters! They killed my daughters. We've been friends for many years and it took me a long time to understand that he decided that the only way to give his children who survived a better life s only by giving them hope. Many people wanted me to take revenge, they asked if I don't hate the Israelis. Whieh Israelis do you want me to hate? The doctors who saved Shada and Raida andfmy brothers? The babies I delivered? Which Israelis do you want me4o hate? Hatred is THE disease we have in this country that giv4es us no rest. Many friends and reporters escorted us to the airport and Shiomi Eldar gave me a jar of sand and said, "Don't you forget this place." "Don't you forget." Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on. A few days ago I called the fake news the enemy of the people and they are, 'they are the enemy of the people. I really love the winter but this year it was especially rough.
