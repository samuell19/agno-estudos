[instrumental music] [music continues] (male #1) Merry Christmas! Heh-he! Remember the needy of Bedrock this Christmas. [indistinct chattering] Thank you, heh, Merry Christmas. Hey, Santa. If you need a pit stop during your midnight ride for the kiddies drop in at the Bedrock community theater. Yeah, we're doing a Christmas carol. Seven o'clock, don't be late. Don't you recognize me, Bert? I'm in it. [laughs] [indistinct chattering] All I've got left are balcony seats. I'll take 'em. All sales are final, no refunds, exchanges or bad reviews. Christmas.. ...bah, humbug. [laughs] Oh, you're gonna knock 'em dead tonight, Freddie boy. Wilma, am I a great Scrooge or what? Huh, you're a great Scrooge, Fred, but you're no help. Oh, come on, Wilma, help me rehearse. Don't forget, you are the stage manager for the Bedrock Community players. - And I, I am the leading actor. - No time, Fred. 'Our costume designer came down with that awful flu' the Bedrock Bug, so now I'm doing wardrobe too. - In case you haven't noticed. - Hey, you're doing costumes? Great, I just pulled a thread. [clears throat] "Christmas, a poor excuse for picking a businessman's pocket every 25th of December." Fred, you are really unbelievable. - Yeah, unbelievable. - Unbelievable? As scrooge? Me? Unthinkable. Well, Mr. Scrooge it sounds like your daughter needs her diaper changed. Uh, sorry, Wilma, I gotta practice my lines. "Christmas? Bah, humbug." Uh.. "Christmas, baah, humbug." There's such a thing as being too well rehearsed. [barking] chomp Hey, everybody's gotta make a livin'. There you go, Pebbles, all better. (Fred) 'Christmas, bah, humbug!' Aww. Pebbles, don't be so hard on daddy. He's trying, very trying. "What's Christmas time to you but a time for paying bills without money?" [Dino barking] Huh? Oh, no! Dino! [barking] Will you stop it! Now look what you've done. [whimpering] You better hope Wilma can clean my costume before show time. Huh, time? Oh, nice going, Dino, now I'm late for work. Christmas, bah, hum-bug. Fred, aren't you forgetting a little something? You're right! My lunch. Wrong, your daughter. You're supposed to drop her off at the Cave Care Center. Remember? Uh, right, Cave Care. And, Fred, don't forget you have to pick Pebbles up at four because I'm going to the theater early. (Fred) 'Christmas, bah, hum-m-bug.' (Wilma) 'Did you hear me?' What a scrooge. [laughing] Pebbles. We're running a little late this morning Miss Feldspar, here you go. Mr. Flintstone, aren't you nervous about your performance tonight? I know I am. Are you kidding? I've been rehearsing night and day. This part is all I've thought about for the last two months. - Kiss, da-da, hug, da-da. - Bah! So I see. [crying] Bye-bye, da-da. - Pebbles. - Bamm-Bamm. What about you, Bamm-Bamm? Are you ready for your part tonight? "God bless us, everyone." Hm, "Please, spirit." - 'Tonight's gonna be a blast.' - "Show me no more. Spirit, I'm not the man I was." thud Hey! Watch where you're going, Flintstone. "I will not be the man I would have been." Uh, hiya, Fred. Ooh! "Take pity, good spirit." Well, well, if it isn't Ebonezer Scrooge himself. Greetings, supporting players. Hey, we're in this play too, Flintstone. Yeah, but there can only be one Scrooge. [laughs] Well, I guess they got the right guy. Uh, gee, Fred, I thought you were never gonna get here. Barney, I was rehearsing. You don't get to be great without rehearsing. Yoo-hoo, Mr. Flintstone. Wanna rehearse our big love scene? Happy to oblige, Maggie. A great actor is always ready to rehearse. Ooh, Ebonezer, I love you. And...and...I love you. - Huh? - Ooh! Flintstone, you're not the only one on the play tonight. Ooh! No, Mr. Slate, but Iam the star. Is that so? Well, I thinkI would have made a better Scrooge. Yeah, you're certainly cheap enough, Mr. Slate. [laughs] That's enough, Rubble, Flintstone. Okay, okay, we're going, we're going. One minute. So there won't be any excuses for getting to the play late everybody gets to leave after lunch. Is that time off with pay? Well.. I suppose so. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas, boss. - Merry Christmas! [groaning] See, I'm no scrooge. No, I am. Well, at least this doesn't have to be a waste of time. We can rehearse. Uh, yeah, sure, Fred, whatever you say. "It feels awfully warm in here, Cragit. 'Have you been using all my coal again?"' 'Barn? Barney?' I said, "Have you been using all my coal again?" Uh, and I thought we chewed scenery for a living. Barney, you missed your cue. Oh, gee, uh, sorry, Fred. 'Is that what's gonna happen tonight?' - 'Come on, pay attention.' - Hey! Gee, Fred, uh, maybe it wouldn't hurt if you pay attention too. - To what? - To work. Oh, come on, Barn, this is show biz. We have a shot at the big time. It's just one night of community theater, Fred, not Broadrock. Let's just get this scene right, okay? - Okay. - Okay. - Okay. - Okay! Now then.. '"Have you been using all--"' Oh, huh, I think I'm going to be sick. No, I take that back, I am sick. [groans] thud Oh, boy, everybody's a critic. [chuckling] Gee, that wasn't a reflection on your performance, Fred. Your bronto got the Bedrock Bug. And it's quitting time. That's what he thinks. Listen, Barn, I still think your acting needs work. If you're not well rehearsed, buddy you could make me look bad. Hey. I know my lines, Fred. Yeah, but there's more to acting than just memorization. Iam Scrooge. Well, I'm sorry, Fred but there's more to life than acting. Not to an actor. Uh, maybe not but in case you've forgotten, tomorrow's Christmas. I've gotta go home and wrap presents. [stammers] P-presents? [laughs] Why, of course, o-of course I didn't forget. What do you think I am? Some kind of scrooge? Oh, boy, nice going, Flintstone. You have nothing to put under the tree for Wilma or Pebbles. Lucky I still have time. vroom Merry Christmas! [chuckles] Remember the needy of Bedrock this Christmas. Christmas, bah, humbug. - Ugh, what a scrooge. - Yeah, good, aren't I? I'm playing Scrooge tonight at the Bedrock Community Theater. I know, now, what about the needy? Hey, I got presents to buy. Look at these prices! How am I gonna find something for Wilma in this madhouse? (boy #1) 'Wow, I've gotta have that.' (Fred) 'Now there's a dress, Wilma's gonna love it.' - It's an Yves saint Laurock. - It's on sale. - Oh, no! - It's my size. (male #2) 'I can't imagine anyone liking it.' Any more of those dresses? Oh, sorry, all sold out. - You should've shopped earlier. - I'll take this one. The necklace doesn't come with it, you know. I'll take that too. It's not real sabretooth, is it? Of course not, they're an endangered species. 'Now, how are you gonna pay for this?' [exhales] Mesozoic Express. (male #3) 'I'm sure your daughter will love' this stuffed pigasaurus, Mr. Flintstone. Yeah, a Jurassic pork. What'll they think up next? Thank you for shopping Bloomingshales. Uh, gift wrapping is over there, Mr. Flintstone. [laughs] Huh? 'Oh, boy!' Uh-uh, no way I'm standing in some long line. (male #4) 'Hey, man.' - Hey, watch where you're going. - What a jerk. - Wrap these. - What's your number? Number? Huh? (male #5) 'You gotta have a number.' Oh! Eighty-six. Thanks, buddy, say, what's your number? Three. Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, I could be standing here for hours. [clock chiming] [squawks] Four o'clock and time for all good boys to have their Christmas shopping done. Oh, well, it's only four o'clock.. Huh! Four o'clock! I've got to get to the the theater! - Hey, what's your number, kid? - 427. I'll make you a deal, take my number 86. Get these wrapped for me and wait here till I get back. Uh, right. [instrumental music] Gotta get to the theater before curtain time or Wilma will kill me. Christmas, humbug. [beeping] ting What a world of fools I live in. splat [siren blaring] Alright, pull over. screech Fred, it's me, Philo Quartz. Didn't you see that red light back there? Philo, I'm a star. I was rehearsing. I'll let you off this time, Fred but you better get the stars out of your eyes and watch where you're going. I know where I'm going, straight to Broadrock. But first, I think I'll stop off for a snack. [shouting] crash [groaning] Ow! (Wilma) Fred, went to the theatre with Betty. See you and Pebbles there later. [laughs] Nothing like a little snack. Burp! Curtain up. 'Bah, humbug!' [instrumental music] (female #1) 'Sit still, I told you..' Well, it's about time, Fred. Why are you so late? Last-minute shop.. Uh-uh, rehearsing. Uh, that's it, last-minute rehearsing. Well, it sounds as if you've got your Scrooge part down pat. Well, thanks, Wilma-- But you've got a lot more rehearsing to do for your role as father. - Huh? - Ooh! Oh, Fred Flintstone, how could you? How could I what? How could you forget your own daughter? - Pebbles? - 'Yes, Pebbles.' Uh-oh. Fortunately, Barney picked her up at Cave Care becauseyou forgot. But she's fine, see? - She's playing with Bamm-- - Fred Flintstone! "God bless us, everyone." That's right, Bamm-Bamm, everyone but Fred. - But, Wilma.. - Don't "But, Wilma" me, Fred. Ever since you got this part all you've thought about is yourself. Ooh! Come on, Scrooge, uh, I mean, Fred. Let's get you into makeup and costume. Whoa! Here, put this on while I finish Mr. Slate's makeup. I still say, I should have played Scrooge. You've got a very important role, Mr. Slate. Besides, that'd be typecasting. [coughing] Perfect, okay, pick up your chains and you're all set. [giggling] Do I look great or what? Makeup's not bad either, Betty. Of course, you had so much to work with. Well, this is your big moment, Mr. Scrooge. You're on. [stammers] A-b-I'm-I'm-I'm on? My hat! My hat! I say, Wilma, are we quite ready? I'm ready to clobber my leading man, Mr. Brickens. Cue the snow. Let's get this show on the road. [rattling] Wish me luck, Wilma. Yeah, break a leg. Curtain. "Marbley was dead to begin with. 'Scrooge knew he was dead. Of course he did."' My cane, my cane. thud '"Scrooge and Marbley' '"were partners in old Piltdown town' '"for I don't know how many years.' '"Scrooge was his sole executor' '"sole friend and sole mourner' '"which brings me back to Marbley's funeral.' '"There's no doubt that Marbley was dead.' '"This must be distinctly understood' '"or nothing wonderful can come of the story' '"I'm going to relate.' '"As for Scrooge' '"he was a squeezing' '"wrenching, grasping, clutching' '"covetous old sinner.' 'Hard and sharp as flint."' [door opening] Uh, Merry Christmas, Mr. Scrooge. Eh. It feels awfully warm in here, Cragit. Have you been using all my coal again? Hmm.. One, two, three.. No, Mr. Scrooge. I-I haven't put any in since y-yesterday. 'And you'll need none tomorrow.' It's a holiday, so I'll save on coal. Hey. But I suppose I still have to pay you. Gee, it's-it's only once a year. And I suppose you'll want the whole day off? Oh, please, sir, it is Christmas. It's only fair. It isn't fair! Hmm. Christmas, humbug. A poor excuse for picking a businessman's pocket every 25th of December. thud Hey. Well, be sure to be here all the earlier the next morning. thud [sighs] Yes, sir, Mr. Scrooge. (Scrooge) 'Why should the world take a day off?' I could be collecting more debts and making more money. Master Ned. Thank you, Bob, but I think I'll need these. - What? - Merry Christmas, uncle. - Christmas? Humbug. - Christmas a humbug, uncle? - Surely you don't mean that. - I do. What reason have you to be merry? 'You're poor enough.' And what reason have you to be miserable? - 'You're rich enough.' - Huh! Bah, humbug. thud Merry Christmas, indeed. [chuckles] Huh! Tell me, my poor nephew, what's Christmas to you? Just a time for paying bills without money. 'A time for finding yourself a year older.' And not an hour richer. If I had my way, every fool who goes about with "Merry Christmas" on his lips 'should be boiled with his own pudding' 'and buried with a stake of holly through his heart.' - Uncle. - Nephew! You keep Christmas in your way and let me keep it in mine. - But you don't keep it. - And I won't. Christmas has done me no good and it will do you no good. Perhaps I haven't profited by it but I say that Christmas is a kind forgiving, charitable time. The only time when men and women seem to open their shut-up hearts freely. Though Christmas has never put any gold or silver in my pocket I believe it has done me good and will do me good and I say, "God bless it." (Scrooge) 'Cragit? Are you trying to get fired?' - 'Get back to your ledgers.' - Uh, no, sir. I-I mean, y-yes, sir. Uh, s-sorry, sir. Now, if you're quite through, nephew, be off with you. But I'm not through, uncle. I want to invite you to Christmas dinner with my wife and I. - No, thank you. - Why not? Why did you marry that penniless girl? - Because I fell in love. - Love? Bah, humbug. Love without money is a bad investment. - Good afternoon. - Please, uncle, dine with us. I want nothing from you. thud - Why can't we be friends? - Humbug. Who needs friends when I have all this? [laughing] Huh, he's a cold one, your uncle is. I'm afraid so, but no reason we shouldn't celebrate. Have a very Merry Christmas, Bob. You too, sir. A very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. Good evening, sir. Do we have the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge or Mr. Marbley? Neither, Mr. Marbley's dead. And addressing Mr. Scrooge will be no pleasure. [knocking on door] (Scrooge) 'Now what?' Can't a man get any work done on this wretched holiday evening? And a wretched holiday it will be for so many of our needy brothers and sisters. That's why we're here to collect money for the Piltdown Charitable Foundation. Ha-ha! What I collect, I keep. Surely, Mr. Scrooge, someone as well off as yourself can afford to donate something. I certainly can, but I won't. I support the workhouses, they cost enough. Those who are badly off must go there. Many can't go there. And many would rather die. If they'd rather die, they had better do it and decrease the surplus population. Good afternoon, gentlemen. I feel sorry for you, Mr. Scrooge. Save your pity for the Piltdown poors. They'll get nothing from me! Well, don't just stand there, Cragit. You can go too, get out of here! Uh, t-thank you, sir. Uh, Merry Christmas, sir. Remember, be here the next morning bright and early. [grunts] Christmas, bah, humbug. [laughing] Hey! Oh, missed me. Oh! - Ah, my hat. - Uh-oh. Hmm. My hat. My hat! Uh-oh. There he goes, constable. That juvenile delinquent 'assaulted my hat with a snowball.' You, there! Stop. - Oh. - 'Gotcha.' Alright, my lad, come along. You've got some tall explaing to do. - It, it was accident, guv. - Just look at this. This hat was made of rare sabretooth muskrat. It's extinct. If you press charges I'll have to throw him in the workhouse. Oh, no need for that. Bring him along. Hey, we was only playing in the snow. I'll give you snow, there! You may shovel a path to my house. Get busy and be quick about it unless you'd prefer the workhouse. Uh, this is worse than the blinking workhouse. [panting] Christmas Eve is supposed to be fun. Fun, bah, humbug. Scrooge. Marbley? [shouting] 'Yaa!' thud Impossible. I must be seeing things. Probably 'cause I haven't had any dinner. (male #6) '"And so Scrooge retired to his rooms' '"in the gloomy old house.' '"And prepared to spend Christmas Eve' '"the way he always did' '"eating leftover gruel...alone.' 'But this Christmas Eve was going to be quite different."' [Marbley howling] 'Scrooge.' Uh, humbug, nothing but the wind. 'Scrooge!' Scrooge. Who are you? Ask me who I was. Alright, alright, have it your way. Who were you? In life, I was your partner Jacob Marbley. Hmm.. You don't believe in me, do you, Scrooge? You're just a figment of my imagination caused by indigestion. It's that leftover gruel. Bah. Scrooge! Dreadful apparition, why do you trouble me? Do you believe in me or not? I believe, I believe. But why trouble me now? You who've been dead for seven long years. Yes. Seven years dead. But the chains, why? I wear the chain I forged in life. I made it link by link and yard by yard. Do you know the weight of the strong coil you bear yourself? And, Scrooge, no amount of regret can make amends for a life's worth of opportunities misused. Misused? But, Jacob you were always a good man of business. Mankind was my business. The common welfare was my business. Charity, mercy and benevolence were all my business. [howling] That doesn't sound like my old partner Marbley. Too true, Scrooge. In life, my spirit never walked beyond our counting house. And now, at this time of year I suffer the most. [screaming] No rest, no peace only incessant torture and remorse. I-I'm-I'm sorry things aren't going well, Jacob. [screaming] Hear me, Scrooge. My time is nearly gone. - I am here to warn you. - Of what? That you still have a hope of escaping my fate. Your fate? Wait! [Marbley howling] 'Don't go!' You will be haunted by three more spirits tonight. More ghosts? Expect the first tonight when the clock strikes midnight. Wait, can't they all visit me at once so I can get it over with? Wait! Not this time, pal. (Marbley) Farewell, Scrooge. Expect me no more and for your own sake remember what has passed between us. [howling] [shivers] Ghosts. Uh, this is nothing but my imagination. Like I said, nothing but a bit of bad leftover gruel. I'm going to bed. And when I wake up in the morning this will all be just a bad dream. [scoffs] [applauding] [cheering] [laughs] Hear that applause, Barn? They really like me. Uh, gee, Fred, I think they like me and Mr. Slate too. You? Don't be silly, Barn. I'm the star. Uh, oh, yeah, I forgot. - Not bad, Fred. - Thanks, Wilma. Yeah, you're really cooking tonight. Perfect for ham. [gasps] Wilma! - Places, everybody. - 'Oh, boy.' Curtain's going up. Mister, could you please lower your head so my kid can see. Hey, that's me. thud [snoring] Cue the wind. [inhaling] [coughs] thud Betty, where's the ghost of Christmas past? Garnet? Gee, I did her makeup ten minutes ago. Maybe she's still in her dressing room. Garnet? You're.. [retching] Sick. My word. Don't tell me.. (in unison) The Bedrock Bug! Now, where are we going to find a ghost of Christmas past. Never mind that, who could possibly even squeeze into her dress? 'Hey, Wilma, maybe you can.' Besides, who else knows everybody's part? Please, Wilma, you must. (Wilma) 'Wake up, Scrooge.' 'You're really asleep, aren't you?' 'You self-centered skinflint.' Oh! Wilma, I-I mean.. Are you the spirit whose coming was foretold to me? I am the ghost of Christmas past. - Long past? - No, your past. I'm here to help you, rise and walk with me. Wait! I'm just a mortal, I'll fall. Just a touch of my hand, there. And you shall be upheld. Ow! No. Take it easy, Wilma, we're supposed to be acting. Sorry, Fred, you're such a convincing scrooge, I forgot. (Scrooge) Where-where are you taking me, spirit? There. ♪ Good King Wenceslas looked out ♪ ♪ On the feast of Stephen ♪ ♪ When the snow lay roundabout ♪ ♪ Deep and crisp and even ♪ ♪ La la la la la la ♪♪ (Scrooge) 'Tom and George and Bill and Harry.' I know these boys. They were my schoolmates when I was a lad. But how can this be? These are only shadows of things that have been. They're completely unaware of us. They're all going home for Christmas. All except for one solitary child neglected by his friends, left all alone. [instrumental music] 'Do you remember the way?' Remember? I could have found this place blindfolded. [applauding] "It amazed the ghost "that Scrooge could remember this place of his youth after having forgotten it for so many years." - How am I doing, Betty? - In the play or with Wilma? Yeah, what's wrong with Wilma? I haven't blown a line, she should be proud. Fred, you'd better get changed. Right. I'm ready for my makeup, Betty. Nervous, Maggie? You look a little green. [giggles] Yeah, I feel like I've got butterflies in my stomach. Well, as long as it's not that Bedrock Bug. Poor Garnet, Wilma had to go on for her. Ooh. I wouldn't give up this part for the world. [laughs] Yoo-hoo! See you in a few minutes, Scroogy for our big love scene. "Despite Scrooge's fond memories "the school had been a victim of hard times "and broken fortunes. '"And within the dreary walls it was just as melancholy.' [groaning] '"A lonely boy, reading near a feeble fire.' '"Yes, it was young Scrooge, alone' '"when all the other boys had gone home' 'for the jolly holidays."' [crying] (female #2) 'It isn't much fun being ignored by your father' and left all alone at school, is it? Pebbles.. Fanny, dear, dear, sister. Dear brother Ebonezer, I've come to bring you home. Home, forever and ever, you haven't been forgotten. Father is so much kinder than he used to be. He spoke so gently to me one night that I was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come home. And he said yes, you should and sent me in a coach to bring you. Oh, Fanny, now I'll never have to be alone again. You won't leave me, will you? [laughs] Of course not, silly. I'm taking you home. [laughs] No, I mean forever, Fanny. We must always be together. [Fanny laughing] Such a delicate creature, your sister. But she had a large heart. And she did leave you. She died as a young woman. - She had children? - My nephew. You loved your sister, Fan, didn't you? And when she died, I said I'd never love anyone again. - Come. - Huh, ooh! But you did love again, didn't you, Scrooge? You, you did-don't mean Belle. Yes, you met her at Fezziwig's. It was at Christmas time, remember? How can I forget? Old Fezziwig. I was apprenticed to him. Why, that's him. Old Fezziwig, bless his heart. 'It's Fezziwig, alive again.' And this is Christmas Eve. But how is this possible? I'm only showing you what has already been. Yo-ho, my boys, no more work tonight. Christmas Eve, Jacob. Christmas, Ebonezer. Clear away, my lads, and let's have some room here. It's time to party! - Did you hear the one about.. - You gotta be kidding. [instrumental music] A small matter to make these silly folks so happy. Small? (Wilma) Certainly no more than a few dollars. (Scrooge) It isn't the money. The happiness he gives can't be measured in gold. What's the matter, Betty? Am I that bad? You're doing a lot better than she is. [groaning] [retching] Maggie? The Bedrock Bug? Think you can handle another part? Do I have a choice? [laughs] Dance, Ebonezer. With one of my daughters, perhaps. [giggling] I've never been much for dancing, Mrs. Fezziwig. [laughing] But in her case, I'll make an exception. May I have this dance, Miss.. - Wilma? - Shh, don't blow your lines. The name is Belle, and you dance divinely, mister.. Ebonezer Scrooge. What happened to Maggie? I'm supposed to be doing this scene with her. Oh, you'd rather do your love scene with her instead of me? [Fred groans] I didn't mean that, I meant.. You're so light on your feet, Miss Belle. Oh! Ow! [shouting] Ah! Now do you rember the night you met Belle? - Oh, I do! - You did love her. I, I mean, I did. - My time grows short, come. - Ooh! Very funny, Wilma, uh, Belle. None of this is in my script. [laughing] I suppose you think... this is funny. [laughs] Belle, wait. There's something I want to say to you. Belle, will you marry me? Uh, yes. Oh, yes, Fre-uh, Ebonezer. - I love you. - And I love you, Belle. [instrumental music] Please, Ebonezer, take it back. But why, Belle? Another idol has taken my place in your heart. A golden one. You're a different man. I haven't changed toward you, I've grown wiser. - 'I was only a boy.' - 'Yes.' But promised great joy when you were a boy. Promises only misery for us now, now that you're a man. But have I asked to end our engagement? In words, no. But if you could choose now would you choose a poor girl like me to marry? - Well.. - Say no more. [sniffs] With a full heart for the love of the man you once were 'I set you free, Ebonezer Scrooge.' Belle.. [crying] May you be happy in the life you've chosen. [sobbing] But I do.. I did love her. (female #3) 'But you loved money and yourself more.' Spirit, why do you delight in torturing me? Take me home, show me no more, no more. (female #3) 'You have seen only things that have already been.' 'That they've happened isn't my fault.' No more. No more. No more! No more. No more! [applauding] Uh, gee, I-I guess all that rehearsal paid off, Fred. You've got them eating out of the palm of your hand. Forget about me, what's eating Wilma? Those tears looked awful real, Barn. - She is a little upset, Fred. - About what? You mean besides forgetting about Pebbles and being a selfish, self-centered scrooge? - Me? - Yep. Well, maybe I should go talk to her. [Wilma sobbing] (Wilma) 'Oh, that selfish, self-centered scrooge.' - 'He only thinks of himself.' - What? I don't think she wants to see you right now, Fred. - She's a little emotional. - But.. 'And why shouldn't she be?' Forgetting your own daughter? Shame on you. Hmm. Wilma won't even talk to me. I don't get it, I haven't knocked over any scenery. - She should be proud. - Take it easy, Fred. Tomorrow's Christmas. How can Wilma stay mad when she's opening your presents under the tree. Right, presents. Oh, presents! [shouting] You're on in ten minutes! Ten minutes is plenty of time to get to Bloomingshales and back. [gasps] 'Oh, no!' If I could get my car out. Better make a run for it. Flintstone, you scrooge. How could you forget the present? [panting] Wilma and Pebbles are never gonna speak to me a-again! [shouting] Ow! "Closed early for Christmas Eve." Oh, no. Let me in. You gotta let me in! There's gotta be another way into this place. Ah! [grunts] Huh? Oh, boy. [yowling] Flintstone, you're a genius. [grunts] Shh. Wow, how does Santa Claus come down those skinny little chimneys? 'Where are my presents?' That kid must've stolen my presents. And I thought I was the scrooge. Well, so much for Christmas spirit. If I ever catch that kid, I'll-- - Scro-oge! - Huh? Scro-oge. Places, everybody. - 'Don't forget your cue.' - 'Who, me?' - Ernie, have you seen Fred? - Sorry, Wilma. Oh, just like the great actor. We're on in three minutes and he's probably off signing autograph. [screaming] The ghost of Christmas yet to come. 'Scro-ooge.' But it, it can't be! 'You're not, not real.' Scro-oge. Wait, spirit. I am not the man I was. I know I've been selfish, but I've changed. Please don't hurt me. [screaming] Fred, it's me, Philo Quartz. 'I was on my way to the theater' when I got a silent alarm about a break in. Honest, honest, I wasn't stealing anything. You can explain on the way back. I knew you'd understand, pal, see you in the third act. Oh, and by the way, thanks for the lift. - Well, it's about time. - Sorry I'm late. - Listen, honey, I need-- - You always need. And don't "Honey" me, you're on. Okay, okay. [applauding] [snoring] (male #7) 'Scro-oge.' Huh? What? 'Who, who...who-who is it?' Must be my imagination. 'Scro-oge.' [laughing] [gasps] I am the ghost of Christmas present. [laughs] Come, look upon me. I'm looking, I'm looking. You have never seen the like of me before. Never, never. [laughing] Whoa! Spirit, take me where you will and if you have anything to teach me 'hopefully I'll profit by it.' Do you know what time it is, Scrooge? Time to eat? [laughing] Christmas morning. Come, touch my robe. [bell chiming] - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Look at all this. - Merry Christmas, Miss Meduser. 'It's Christmas morning, Scrooge.' Someone will have a merry feast of that prize bird. Oop! Isn't it wonderful? Hmm, delicious. Come, Scrooge, there's much more to see. Yeah, but not too much to eat. 'What's that?' My own special seasoning. Christmas spirit. And it works on any kind of dinner on this day? To any dinner kindly given. And to a poor one most of all. Why to a poor one most? Because it needs it most. - 'Ah, here we are.' - Huh? If the poor are so blessed why do you leave them in such misery? I? Many evils are done in the name of goodness. But deeds of pride, hatred, envy, bigotry and selfishness must be attributed to their true perpetrators. I don't understand. This is my clerk, Bob Cragit's house. Let's go inside, shall we? [barking] Huh? - We're home, mother. - Uh, da-da. They can't see us, can they, ghost? (male #7) 'No, Scrooge, they can't.' [barking] And how did little Tim behave? As good as gold and better. 'He told me, coming home' that he hoped people saw him in the church. Because he was a cripple and it might be pleasant to them to rember on Christmas day who made lame beggars walk and blind men see. [sobbing] [laughing] Time for Christmas dinner, you two. Was there ever such a glorious bird. [sniffs] The most delicious chickasaurus you ever made. [sniffs] It does smell good. 'And they seem like such a happy family.' But it's such a meager meal. I'm afraid it's all a clerk in your employee 'can afford, Scrooge.' A merry Christmas to us all, my dears. - God bless us. - God bless us. [babbles] God bless us, everyone. He seems so...so weak. (male #7) 'It's no concern of yours.' Spirit, tell me, will-will Tiny Tim live? [laughing] I see a vacant seat in the poor chimney corner and a crutch without an owner, carefully preserved. If these shadows remain unaltered by the future the child will die. No, no! Oh, oh, no, kind spirit. Say he will be spared. (male #7) 'So what if he dies?' He'll just decrease the surplus population. I give you Mr. Scrooge, the founder of this feast. The founder of this feast indeed. If he was here, I'd give him a piece of my mind to feast upon. [snarls] He's selfish, self-centered and only thinks of himself. [yells] Not very popular, am I? [barking] Haah! Phew, huh! But, my dear, it's Christmas day. Yes, only on Christmas day could one make a toast to the health of such an odious, stingy hard, unfeeling man as Mr. Scrooge. I'll toast his health for your sake and because it's Christmas, not for his. A merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to Mr. Scrooge. - I've seen enough, spirit. - Come, Scrooge. There are more parties to attend. [laughing] Huh? Why, that's my nephew, Ned. 'Oh, look, they're playing charades.' 'So that's my nephew's wife.' 'Almost reminds me of my sister.' Two syllables. - 'Fish.' - 'He's quite good, my nephew.' Very clever. (male #7) 'Don't tell me you've never met your own nephew's wife.' - 'No.' - 'Fishmonger!' - 'Sells fish.' - That's not right. Sell fish, selfish! Oh, very clever girl. - 'Having a good time?' - 'Oh, I'm having a grand time.' (male #8) 'Screwdriver?' (male #7) 'See what you've missed by heeding the clinking of coins' 'instead of the sounds of laughter and merriment?' Screw, uh, Scrooge! Uncle Scrooge, get it? Selfish, cheap Uncle Scrooge. Yes, but he's given us all a wonderful evening and here's to him. (in unison) 'Here's to Uncle Scrooge.' Uh, they've included me in their fun. Nice boy, your nephew. Ned? Oh, he's a wonderful boy. [sniffles] He has the good heart of my sister Fan who I loved so dearly. Come, Scrooge, it's time. Must we go, spirit? Can't-can't we stay just, just a little longer? My time upon this globe is over. [bell tolling] [squawks] It's midnight. Spirit? Where are you? [yells] [groans] I'm in the presence of the ghost of Christmas yet to come. You're about to show me shadows of things that have not happened but will happen in the time before us, is that so, spirit? Ghost of the future, I fear you more than any specter I've seen. Oh, but I know your purpose is to do me good. Will you not speak to me? Then lead on, phantom. [instrumental music] - When did he die? - Last night, I believe. I thought he'd never die. I wonder who he left all his money to. Haven't heard, guv. But he hasn't left it to me, that's all I know. Spirit, what has all this to do with me? And why am I not in my accustomed place at this hour? [intense music] [Scrooge gulps] Where are we, spirit? [yells] Oh, oh, I don't like this place. Please, can't we go? 'No, no, no, I won't look.' 'You can't make me.' Is there no one in this whole town who feels any emotion about this man's death? After you, please. [laughing] Spirit, what have these miscreants to do with me? It's all I could scrounge, but it is something and everyone has a right to take care of himself, eh? After all, he always did. I'm afraid this is all there was. Now, who's next? Please, spirit, no more. Well, what'll you pay, Joe? [laughing] A darn sight more than he was worth in life, right? [laughs] What about these bed-curtains, Joe? You didn't take them down, rings and all with him lying there, did you? I sure did. [clicks tongue] Got his blanket as well. He won't need them to keep him warm where he's going, I daresay. [laughing] He didn't have no friends in life 'but we'll look after him in death.' [laughing] I see, spirit. The case of this unhappy man might be my own. My life is already turning in that direction. Can you show me no tenderness connected with the death? Your father's late again, Martha. I think he's walking a little slower than he used to. When he walked with Tiny Tim upon his shoulders 'he walked very fast, indeed.' He was very light to carry and your father loved him, so that it was no trouble. [crying] No trouble at all. I wish you could have gone, dear. It'd have done you good to see what a pretty place it is. But you'll see it. I promised him that I'd walk there on Sundays. [sobbing] Oh, poor Tiny Tim. My poor little child. [crying] None of us shall ever forget Tiny Tim. How patient and sweet he was even though he was a little, little child. Not Tiny Tim. [intense music] No! So this is what you wanted me to see. [gasps] 'Is that the grave of the man' whom no one mourns? No! Answer me one question, spirit. Are these the shadows of things that will be or only of what may be? No! No, I mean, if a man were to change his life his life's journey could also change. Oh, please, spirit, say it's so. Yaah! N-no, no, spirit, no, no, no, hear me. I am not the man I was. I will not be the man I would have been were it not for you and your fellow spirits. Why show me this if I'm past all hope? Take pity, good spirit. Assure me that I may change these shadows you have shown me by an altered life. Iwill change! I will honor Christmas in my heart and try to keep it all the year. The spirits of past present and future shall live within me. Oh, I will not forget the lesson they have so generously taught! I am not the man I was. I am not the man I.. Hey, I'm alive, I'm still alive. They're not torn down, they're here, I'm here. The shadows of the things that would have been may be dispelled. They will be, oh, I know they will. [chuckles] There's the chair where the ghost of Christmas present sat. And there's the window where Marbley's ghost joined the wandering spirits. It all happened, it's all true. Oh, I'm light as a feather, I'm as happy as an angel. A Merry Christmas to everybody! 'Happy New Year to the world!' Heaven and Christmas time be praised. Thank you, Jacob Marbley. Thank you. On my knees. Thank you. [grunts] 'You, there. Boy. Tell me...' [grunts] [laughs] I suppose I had that coming. - No, wait, kid. - Uh-oh. Mean old skinflint! I've already shoveled your blooming sidewalk! [chuckles] Yes, and you did a wonderful job! Now you can do another. What's today? Today? What do you think? It's Christmas Day! Yabba-dabba.. Ow! It's Christmas Day. I haven't missed it. The spirits have done it all in one night. And why not? They can do anything they want. Whoa, he's not only cheap, he's crazy as a cootasaurus. Wait! Does the poultry shop still have that prize turkeysaurus in the window? - The one as big as me? - That's the one. Buy it. And have the poultry man bring it back here. 'And here's something for your trouble.' - On me way, guv. - Heh-he-he.. I'll send that turkeysaurus over to Bob Cragit's. And I shan't tell them who sent it either. [chuckles] No more measly dinners for that family. Thanks for being so prompt, my good fellow. [coin clinks] Off to Bob Cragit's house with that and mind you no telling who sent it! [humming] wham Excuse me, gentle.. Heh? Wilma? Uh, Belle? What are you doing here? I'm a card-carrying member of the Piltdown Charitable Foundation. What happened to the other guy? He's a little under the weather this morning. [man groaning] Now, if you'll excuse me, Mr. Scrooge we have nothing further to discuss. Nothing to discuss? But we haven't spoken to each other.. It seems like years. I'm a changed man, Wil..uh, Belle. Of course you're a changed man. It's in the script...Scrooge. None of this is in my script. Oh, I know I've been a selfish, self-centered boob but I've changed. - Really, Wilma. - They're making it all up! Look, I want to start giving instead of taking. And I'd like to start with a little something for the Piltdown Charitable Foundation. Thank you for your generosity, Mr. Scrooge. Merry Christmas. But...Belle, wait. Can't we talk about it over Christmas dinner? I'm going to my nephew's. Would you care to join me? Is he, uh, anything like you, Mr. Scrooge? More like the man I used to be, and hope to be again. [chuckles] [knocking on door] Who could that be? [grunts] thud [grunts] [groaning] I hope you like turkeysaurus. [chuckling] - Surprise! - Uncle Scrooge? Yes, it's me. I've come for Christmas dinner and brought a friend. That is, if you and your lovely wife will have us. [stammers] With all my heart, uncle. So, you're the infamous Uncle Scrooge. - It's a miracle. - You got that right. Why, you don't seem mean at all. [chuckles] [ticking] [growling] That Cragit. [grunts] Uh-oh. You're late, Cragit. Uh, I-I am behind my-my time, sir. I-I was making rather m-merry yesterday. But it's only once a year, s-sir. Huh? I tell you, I won't stand for it, Cragit! You, y-you won't, sir? Absolutely not. From now on, you should be merry the whole year. [chuckles] - Well, what do you think, guv? - Perfect. [babbling] Well, don't just stand there. What do you think...partner? - Partner, me? - If you'll have me, Bob. There are a great many back payments in my offer. - I assure you. - Uh, sounds pretty good. But, uh, how about "Cragit & Scrooge?" [chuckling] Fine with me. [instrumental music] [chuckling] Da-da. All done, guv. Huh? Done? Oh, no, my friend. This is just the beginning. From now on, I, Ebenezer Scrooge will always be there to help those less fortunate than myself. Blimey. And not just at Christmas but all year long. "Scrooge was better than his word. "He did it all and infinitely more. '"And to Tiny Tim, who did not die' '"he was a second father.' '"He became as good a friend' "as good a master, and as good a man "as the good old town of Piltdown new '"or any other town for that matter.' '"He never saw the spirits again' '"but he took their lessons to heart.' '"And it was always said of him' '"that he knew how to keep Christmas well' "if any man alive possessed the knowledge. "May that be truly said of us and all of us. 'And so, as Tiny Tim observed.."' [stammering] Ga-ga-ag-gaa.. God bless us, everyone. [audience applauding] [grunts] Hey! What was that for? (in unison) For being such a scrooge! But, Wilma, I'm not a scrooge anymore. I understand what's really important. [Pebbles screeching] You and Pebbles and Barney and Betty. - Aw, Fred. - "Aw, Fred," nothing. Where exactly did this sudden burst of Christmas spirit come from? Well, there were these three ghosts. Maybe we really could talk about it over Christmas dinner? Just you and me and Pebbles and, and your mother, too. Da-da. Oh, Fred, do you really mean it? I yabba-dabba do. [audience applauding] Wow! Hey, listen to that applause they really loved me. - Fred. - Just kidding, honey. They loved us. [audience cheering] [gasps] Thank you. But these belong to the real star of this play. Gee, thanks, Mr. Brickens. Wilma, I couldn't have done it without you. Stage manager, costume maker and actress. You...are a miracle worker. She's a miracle worker, alright. She's my wife. Let's hear it for her. Yabba-dabba-doo! Hear that? Wilma was great, wasn't she, Philo? [Barney chuckling] Dino, you were the ghost? - But what happened to Philo? - The Bedrock Bug. [Philo groaning] Huh? Ah...ah...ah...ah.. [sneezes] [grunts] Wilmaa-a! Yuck! [groaning] [audience applauding] Great show, Wilma. Not bad, Fred. Very funny, Betty. Uh, come on, Betty. We gotta get home. I've got some presents to put under the tree. [chuckles] Merry Christmas, you guys. "God bless us, everyone." [chuckles] A little late, but not bad. Fred, what's the matter? Oh, alright, you can have the bouquet. Well, it's not that, Wilma. I, uh.. You see.. It's just.. Guv, uh-uh, Mr. Flintstone, I got these wrapped for you. Uh, when you didn't come back to get them I-I thought I'd better bring them to the theater. Oh, you saved my skin, kid. I owe you a big tip. [chuckles] Oh, forget it, Mr. Flintstone. I-it's Christmas. Oh, Christmas. [chuckling] You said it, Pebbly-poo. Come on, gang. Let's go home and celebr.. Uh, Wilma, I don't feel so good. The Bedrock Bug. Oh.. 'Don't worry, Fred, I hear it only lasts 24 hours.' You'll be fine in time for my mother's Christmas dinner. [groaning] [retching] [chuckles] This is one Christmas Eve Fred will never forget. [retching continues] Don't worry, honey. I'll drive. [instrumental music] [music continues]
