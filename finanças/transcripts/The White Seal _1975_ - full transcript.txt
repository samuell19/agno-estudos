CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY ARTISAN HOME ENTERTAINMENT Narrator: THIS IS THE STORY OF KOTICK THE WHITE SEAL AND THE LONG VOYAGES HE MADE THROUGH THE OCEANS OF THE EARTH IN SEARCH OF A PERFECT ISLAND, AN ISLAND WHERE SEALS COULD BE SAFE FOREVER FROM THEIR TERRIBLE ENEMY-- MAN. ALL THESE THINGS HAPPENED YEARS AGO AT A PLACE CALLED NOVASTOSHNAH ON THE ISLAND OF ST. PAUL, AWAY AND AWAY IN THE BERING SEA. NOBODY COMES TO NOVASTOSHNAH EXCEPT ON BUSINESS, AND THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO HAVE REGULAR BUSINESS THERE ARE THE SEALS... AND THOSE WHO HUNT THE SEALS. IN THE SUMMER MONTHS BY THE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS, THE SEALS COME OUT OF THE COLD GRAY SEA, FOR NOVASTOSHNAH HAS PROBABLY THE FINEST ACCOMMODATIONS FOR SEALS OF ANY PLACE IN ALL THE WORLD. SEA CATCH WAS 15 YEARS OLD, A HUGE TAWNY-FUR SEAL, WHOSE WEIGHT-- IF ANYONE HAD BEEN FOOLISH ENOUGH TO TRY AND WEIGH HIM-- WAS NEARLY 700 POUNDS. [GROWLING] [ROARING] [SPLASH] SEA CATCH WAS ALWAYS READY FOR JUST ONE MORE FIGHT IN DEFENSE OF HIS HOME, BUT, AS THERE WERE 40 OR 50,000 OTHER BULL SEALS HUNTING FOR THE SAME THING EACH SPRING, GOOD SPACE WAS DIFFICULT TO FIND AND EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO DEFEND. THE WIVES WISELY NEVER CAME TO THE ISLAND UNTIL LATE IN MAY OR IN EARLY JUNE, FOR THEY DID NOT CARE TO BE TORN TO PIECES. SEA CATCH HAD JUST FINISHED HIS 45th FIGHT THAT YEAR WHEN MATKAH, HIS SOFT, SLEEK, GENTLE-EYED WIFE, CAME UP OUT OF THE SEA. OH, IT'S YOU, LATE AS USUAL. WHERE THE DEVIL HAVE YOU BEEN? HOW THOUGHTFUL OF YOU, DEAR. YOU'VE TAKEN THE OLD PLACE AGAIN. I HAVEN'T BEEN DOING ANYTHING BUT FIGHT FOR IT SINCE THE MIDDLE OF MAY. THE BEACH IS DISGRACEFULLY CROWDED THIS SEASON. OHH, WHY CAN'T PEOPLE STAY WHERE THEY BELONG? YOU DO PROVIDE SUCH A BEAUTIFUL NURSERY FOR OUR BABIES EVERY YEAR, SEA CATCH. OH, YOU'RE A WONDERFUL HUSBAND AND FATHER, TOO. Matkah: SEA CATCH... I DO BELIEVE... OUR BABY, OUR KOTICK IS GOING TO STAY WHITE. EMPTY CLAMSHELLS AND DRY SEAWEED! THERE HAS NEVER BEEN SUCH A THING... [SNORTS] AS A WHITE SEAL. WELL, THERE IS NOW, AND HE'S YOUR SON. COME ALONG, DARLING. WHITE SEAL! PREPOSTEROUS! NOTHING LIKE THAT EVER HAPPENED ON MY SIDE OF THE FAMILY. [WHIMPERING] [BARKS] [BARKS] [BARKING] [BARKING] [SEA CATCH ROARS] [WHIMPERING] [WHIMPERS] [ROARS] Narrator: BABY SEALS CANNOT SWIM WHEN THEY ARE BORN, BUT THEY ARE UNHAPPY UNTIL THEY LEARN, AND SO, THEY CONSTANTLY MOVE TOWARDS THE SEA. [WAILING] [BARKS] [BARKS] PRACTICING IN A SHALLOW, PROTECTED COVE UNDER THE WATCHFUL EYE OF HIS MOTHER, IT TOOK KOTICK LONG WEEKS OF FLOUNDERING TO LEARN TO USE HIS FLIPPERS. AND THEN, ONE DAY, KOTICK FOUND THAT HE TRULY BELONGED TO THE WATER, THAT HE BELONGED TO THE SEA, NOT THE LAND. LATE IN OCTOBER, THE SEALS LEAVE ST. PAUL'S FOR THE DEEP WATER, FOLLOWING THE GREAT FISH ROADS OF THE SEA, THE PATHS TAKEN FOREVER AND EVER BY HUGE SCHOOLS OF FISH. MY DEAR. SEE IF YOU CAN GET A DECENT TAN ON THAT CHILD BEFORE NEXT YEAR. TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF, DEAR. GOOD-BYE, DADDY. Narrator: THE POWERFUL BULLS, SECURE IN THEIR FAT WET SUITS, SPEND THE WINTER IN THE ICY ALASKAN WATERS, WHILE THE MOTHERS AND THEIR YOUNG SWIM THOUSANDS OF MILES SOUTH PAST SAN FRANCISCO, AS FAR SOUTH AS SAN DIEGO AND MEXICO. AND NOW KOTICK'S EDUCATION REALLY BEGAN. HIS MOTHER TAUGHT HIM HOW TO FOLLOW THE HALIBUT ALONG THE UNDERSEA BANKS OF THE NORTH PACIFIC. MATKAH SHOWED HIM WHERE THE COD SWAM AND HOW TO FIND THEM. SHE SHOWED HIM HOW TO WRENCH THE ROCKLING OUT OF HIS HOLE AMONG THE WEEDY REEDS. AND BEFORE LEAVING HIM TO LEARN TO SURVIVE ALONE, SHE TAUGHT HIM HOW TO SKIRT THE WRECKS LYING A HUNDRED FATHOMS BELOW WATER SO THAT HE COULD ESCAPE THE SEALS' MOST TERRIFYING ENEMY-- THE SHARK. KOTICK SOON LEARNED THE IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SHARKS AND DOLPHINS-- THAT DOLPHINS HAVE HORIZONTAL OR FLAT TAILS, JUST AS DO SEALS, WALRUS, SEA OTTERS, AND ALL OTHER SEA MAMMALS, WHILE SHARKS AND ALL OTHER FISH HAVE VERTICAL OR UP-AND-DOWN TAILS. "HMM," THOUGHT KOTICK, "FLAT TAIL. "THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A VERY LARGE DOLPHIN. "BUT THEN, "IT MIGHT JUST BE HELPFUL SOMETIME TO HAVE A DOLPHIN AS BIG AS THIS ONE FOR A FRIEND." OOH, UH, GOOD DAY, MR. DOLPHIN, SIR? DOLPHIN? DOLPHIN? I, YOUNG MAN, AM 87 FEET LONG. I WEIGH 216,000 POUNDS, 13 OUNCES; THEREFORE, I AM A WHALE, NOT A DOLPHIN OR A SARDINE, RIGHT? RIGHT. OH, VERY RIGHT. OH, VERY, VERY, VERY RIGHT INDEED. YES. JUST SO WE UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER. NOW RUN ALONG. I WANT TO TAKE A NAP FOR ABOUT 2 WEEKS. YES? [STAMMERS] GOOD NAP-- UH, GOOD NIGHT, UH, SIR-- UH, MR. DOLPHIN-- OOH! MR. WHALE! Narrator: THEN, ONE DAY, KOTICK SAW ANOTHER STRANGE BUT HARMLESS-LOOKING SEA CREATURE. KOTICK, I LEAVE YOU ALONE FOR A FEW WEEKS, AND YOU ALMOST LOSE YOUR LIFE. NEVER, NEVER, EVER STOP TO LOOK AT A BOAT. A BOAT? LOSE MY-- BUT IT HAS A FLAT TAIL. OH, ARE BOATS BAD... [GULPS] LIKE SHARKS? BOATS ARE THE MOST DANGEROUS THINGS ON THE OCEAN, BECAUSE BOATS CARRY MEN. MEN? MEN ARE THE MOST TERRIBLE, MOST PITILESS ENEMY SEALS WILL EVER KNOW. BUT DO MEN HAVE UP-AND-DOWN TAILS? HOW CAN I KEEP AWAY FROM THEM? HOW DO I KNOW THEM WHEN I SEE THEM? YOU WILL KNOW THEM, MY DARLING, BECAUSE... [SIGHS] THEY WILL BE DRESSED IN THE SKINS OF DEAD SEALS. Narrator: BUT AFTER 6 MORE MONTHS ALONE WITHOUT SETTING FLIPPER ON DRY LAND, AFTER SEEING BOATS ONLY AT GREAT DISTANCES, KOTICK HAD LOST ALL FEAR OF THAT MYSTERIOUS THING CALLED MAN. HE HAD GROWN ENORMOUSLY, AND HE WAS ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THAT WHAT HE DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THE OCEAN WASN'T WORTH KNOWING. HUTCHINSON'S HILL WAS THE EXCLUSIVE CLUB OF THE HOLLUSCHICKIE-- THE YOUNG MALES-- WELL AWAY FROM THE BEACHFRONT OF THE FIGHTING BULLS. AND THERE THEY PRACTICED THE GAMES THAT WOULD MAKE THEM STRONG ENOUGH TO FIGHT IN THEIR DAY. WHAT A WONDERFUL LIFE! THE HAPPIEST THING IN THE WORLD WAS TO BE A HOLLUSCHICKIE... [CLANGING] THE HAPPIEST, SAFEST... THE MOST DELIGHTFUL? [CLANGING] Matkah: THEY WILL BE WEARING THE SKINS OF DEAD SEALS. MEN... [SHUDDERS] MEN! MEN! MEN! MEN! OH, QUICKLY! COME QUICKLY! THE MEN ARE DRIVING ALL THE HOLLUSCHICKIE AWAY! I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO SKIN THEM. YOU CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT SKIN. OH, NONSENSE! THEY'LL TAKE ONLY A FEW OF THEM. THEY'VE DONE IT FOR 30 YEARS. 30 YEARS? A FEW OF THEM? WHAT'S A FEW YOUNG BULLS MORE OR LESS? TOO MANY OF THEM CLUTTERING UP THE BEACH ANYWAY. [ECHOING] STOP IT! STOP IT! STOP IT! STOP IT! STOP IT! STOP IT! STOP IT! STOP! STOP! STOP IT! STOP! STOP IT! STOP IT! STOP! STOP! STOP IT! IT...IT CAN'T BE. IT'S--IT'S A WHITE SEAL. IT'S A GHOST. IT'S THE GHOST OF ALL THE SEALS WE'VE EVER KILLED! RUN! IT'S COME BACK TO HAUNT US! RUN! [BARKING] RUN! RUN! [ROARS] [ROAR ECHOING] I SUPPOSE IT IS RATHER AWFUL FROM YOUR WAY OF LOOKING AT IT. BUT IF YOU SEALS WILL COME HERE YEAR AFTER YEAR, OF COURSE THE MEN GET TO KNOW OF IT, AND UNLESS YOU CAN FIND AN ISLAND WHERE NO MAN EVER COMES, YOU WILL ALWAYS BE HUNTED. ISN'T THERE ANY SUCH ISLAND, ANYPLACE WE CAN GO AND BE SAFE? GO AND ASK THE SEA COW. HE WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED OFF LONG AGO IF HE HADN'T HAD A SAFE PLACE TO GO DURING HUNTING SEASON. IF HE'S ALIVE, HE'LL KNOW WHERE YOUR ISLAND IS. BUT HOW SHALL I RECOGNIZE THE SEA COW, IF I FIND HIM? HE'S THE ONLY THING IN THE OCEAN UGLIER THAN A WALRUS. [SCREECHES MERRILY] FLATTERY WILL GET YOU NOWHERE. HA HA. BUT HE'S RIGHT, MY BOY. I AM FORCED TO ADMIT IT. YOU MUST LOOK FOR SOMEONE UGLIER... [YAWNS] OH, DEAR... THAN I AM. WHEN YOU DO, YOU WILL HAVE FOUND THE SEA COW. THANK YOU! THANK YOU! I'LL FIND HIM! DON'T YOU WORRY! I'LL FIND THE SEA COW! IDEALISTIC YOUNG FOOL! WHY DOESN'T HE GROW UP AND HAVE A FAMILY? THEN THE HUNTERS WILL LEAVE HIM ALONE. BUT WON'T THE KILLING EVER STOP, SEA CATCH? AS LONG IT'S KEPT WITHIN REASONABLE LIMITS. DON'T THINK ABOUT IT, MY DEAR. IT DOESN'T AGREE WITH ME. Narrator: BUT KOTICK WAS DETERMINED TO FIND THE SEA COW WHEREVER HE WAS AND THROUGH HIM TO FIND THE PERFECT ISLAND WITH GOOD FIRM BEACHES FOR SEALS TO LIVE ON, WHERE MEN COULD NOT COME WITH BLOODY CLUBS. KOTICK MET WITH MORE ADVENTURES THAN CAN BE TOLD AND NARROWLY ESCAPED THE JAWS OF THE BASKING SHARK, THE GREAT WHITE SHARK, AND... THE HAMMERHEAD. FOR 5 LONG YEARS, HE SEARCHED AND DREAMED OF AT LAST MEETING THE SEA COW AND THEN FINDING THE PERFECT ISLAND, QUESTIONING FRIENDLY ANIMALS OF THE SEA WHEREVER HE TRAVELED. HE WENT TO THE GREAT BARREN GALAPAGOS OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC. HE WENT TO THE GEORGIA ISLANDS, THE ORKNEYS... EMERALD ISLAND, LITTLE NIGHTINGALE ISLAND... McMURDO SOUND AND THE DRY TORTUGAS. AND THEN, ONE DAY, WORN OUT AND RIDDEN BY DISCOURAGEMENT, WHEN HE HAD ALL BUT GIVEN UP... YES? [CHUCKLES] YEAH. I WONDER, SIR, IF YOU'VE EVER MET THE SEA COW IN YOUR TRAVELS? OF COURSE I HAVE. HOW COULD I MISS ANYONE THAT UGLY? PLEASE, SIR, CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE HE IS? OH, I'LL DO BETTER THAN THAT. I'LL TAKE YOU TO HIM. HANG ON! THERE HE IS, THE SEA COW. Kotick: BY THE GREAT COMBERS OF MAGELLAN! UGLIER THAN THE WALRUS. [CHUCKLES] WELL, I'D CALL THAT AN ACADEMIC MATTER. GOOD-BYE. Narrator: NIGHT AFTER NIGHT AND DAY AFTER DAY, KOTICK WATCHED THE SEA COW, BUT THE SEA COW MUNCHED AND SLURPED SO SLOWLY ALONG THAT KOTICK'S TEMPER HAD ALMOST GONE WHERE THE DEAD CRABS GO. THEN, WEEKS LATER, THE SEA COW SUDDENLY, SURPRISINGLY SANK THROUGH THE SHINY WATER, SANK LIKE A STONE, AND TO KOTICK'S ASTONISHMENT, BEGAN TO SWIM QUICKLY, SO QUICKLY THAT IT WAS ALL KOTICK COULD DO TO KEEP UP WITH HIM. RIDICULOUS! ABSOLUTE TOMMYROT! MYSTICAL ISLAND? MYSTICAL POPPYCOCK! HA! ABSURD! UNBELIEVABLE! IMPOSSIBLE! NO SUCH THING! TROUBLEMAKER! NOW, I'VE DONE MY BEST FOR YOU THESE 5 SEASONS PAST. I FOUND THE ISLAND WHERE YOU'LL BE SAFE FROM MAN, BUT UNLESS YOUR SILLY HEADS ARE DRAGGED OFF YOUR SILLY NECKS, YOU SIMPLY WON'T BELIEVE, SO I AM GOING TO TEACH YOU NOW! LOOK OUT FOR YOURSELVES! [ROARS] [GROWLING] [GROWLS] [BARKING] HE MAY BE A DREAMER, BUT HE IS THE BEST FIGHTER ON THE BEACHES. [ROARING] [ROARS] DON'T TACKLE YOUR FATHER, MY SON. I'M WITH YOU! [ROARING] Narrator: AND THAT IS HOW THE GREAT MIGRATION FROM NOVASTOSHNAH BEGAN, UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF KOTICK AND SEA CATCH, AND THAT IS WHY BLOODY CLUBS ARE FOUND NO MORE ON LUKANNON BEACH. SON, I'M PROUD OF YOU, AND I'M PROUD TO BE GOING WITH YOU TO YOUR ISLAND, BUT, UH, UNH, IT WOULD BE EVEN BETTER IF SUCH A PLACE EXISTED. Narrator: EVERY YEAR, YEAR AFTER YEAR, MORE AND MORE SEALS CAME TO THESE QUIET, SHELTERED COVES, THESE SUN-STRUCK BEACHES WHERE KOTICK SITS ALL SUMMER LONG, GETTING BIGGER AND STRONGER AND FATTER EACH YEAR IN THE GOLDEN SEA... WHERE NO MAN COMES. CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY ARTISAN HOME ENTERTAINMENT
