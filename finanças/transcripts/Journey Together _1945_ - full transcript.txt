4-2-3's still waiting for the 12 long flight. What the devil? Who's the duty with? Corporal Wilton's flight. Well where the heck is he? Go and find him. I don't think it'll do much good, flyer. Not much good? Well he's gone up a flight. Gone up? Well how did you know the accused was out flying? Well I saw him, sir. Zero five was taxing out and well, the accused, he kind of waved to me, sir. What do you mean he kind of waved to you? Show me. Well sir, he uh... Show me, show me. Yes, I see, the victory sign. Do you wanna question the witness? No, sir. You can go, Jay. About turn. Quick march. Right wheel, halt. Well, have you anything to say for yourself? No, sir. You realize this is a very serious matter. Yes sir, but, well I, I never had the chance to fly before, sir. Well if you're so keen on flying, why didn't you join the air crew in the first place? I did sir. Oh, selection board turn you down? No sir, they told me at recruiting center I didn't stand a chance with the educational standards. Well where were you educated? Elementary school sir, I left when I was 14. Well what made you master as a wireless electrical mechanic? Well, when I left school, I went into my father's wireless shop and I stayed there for about... All right, all right, we don't want to hear your whole life history. I should have thought instead of taking illicit joy rides in ensigns, you would have been better employed in your spare time filling up the gaps in your education with the education officer. Yes, sir. But, what do you mean, yes sir? Well, I-I mean that's what I do sir in my spare time. Oh, oh well the fact remains that you've committed a very serious offense. I shall remand you to the commanding officer for punishment. Escort the accused, right turn, quick march. Right wheel. Flight. Sir. Make a note of that boy's name, will you? In what connection, sir? Interview for the air crew. Now tell me, what makes you want to fly? Well, I don't know sir, I just want to, that's all. I'm afraid you didn't do too well in your exams, corporal, how is that? Well I think it was the time limit, sir. I'm afraid I got a bit nervy. A member of air crew shouldn't suffer from nerves. But, it's a different sort of nerves, sir. Is it? Supposing you were in a bomber coming back from Germany over the north sea somewhere. And the captain had decided to ditch the aircraft. Now he'd tell the navigator to work up the exact position for the SOS. And he might give as a time limit say as little as 30 seconds. Supposing you were that navigator? Oh, I-I wanna be a pilot sir, not a navigator. I'm sure you do. 90% of the men who come before this board want to be pilots. But you must realize that it's up to those who train you to decide what you're best fitted for. I can see you think that's going to be pilot. I know it is, sir. All right, corporal, we'll recommend you for air crew duties to the category of navigator, pilot, or air bomber. Oh boy, I, I mean thanks very much, sir. How much, sir? 63. There we go. Hey. Been here before? Oh no, I used to go to the white city. Do any good there? Well I've got a system. My double traps one six on each race. Well do you make any money, eh? Well not exactly, but it's suppose to be a cracking good system. Hello, fill it in there. Name? Aynesworth. Christian names? John Arthur Fitzhoward. F-I-T-Z? That's right. Right-o, fill that in in there, and when you're done there hand it to the refs over there. Name? Smith, S-M-I-T-H. There's four, next. That's five. That's nice material. Is it, next. A little big, isn't it? You'll grow, next. Hype, attention! Sit down, please. Firstly, I want to welcome you to the Royal Air Force. Many of you have waited a long while for this day, now it's arrived. The training you will receive will be the best that human science and ingenuity can make it. You'll only be at this center for a few days, but those days will be devoted to the first requisite of flying training, physical fitness. Out, together, out, together, out, together, wake up! Out, together, out, together, out, together, out. Now with your arms raising and lowering sideways, ready, change, and stretch your fingers, slap your thighs. Out, together, out. Come on, that's not good enough. I'll keep you here til next Tuesday fortnight. Until we get it right. Oh! Not such a bad looking crowd. No, pretty well outstanding I'd say, sir. I say old brute, jolly good show the old alma mater put up in the boat race today, one, one, one. Good gracious, Mr. Aynesworth this is a surprise. How are you, sir? Very well, thanks old boy Wideway. Except that I feel like a fresher again. I trust you'll be coming back to us sir after this trouble is over. I hope so, Wideway, depends how long the trouble lasts. Yes, sir. May I see it? Yeah, if you like. Charming, are you married? No, but we're gonna be when this lot's over. May be a long time, you know. We don't mind waiting. Better stir clear of the Canadian wafts when you get over to the other side. Good lord, our beds were hard but not as hard as this. Um, how many undergrads were in a room like this? Only one, as a matter of fact we had two rooms, a bedroom and a sitting room. Gosh. You know, you make me feel like a bloated plutocrat. Sorry, I didn't mean to. Anyway, we're all in the same boat now. Weft, W-E-F-T, weft. Wings, engines, fuselage, tailplane. Now let me see, you Aynesworth. Yes, you Aynesworth, what's that one? 109. It's uh, uh 111 sir. Aynesworth, did you get that last sentence? Yes sir, I think so, sir. Yes sir, I have. The prime minister concluded his remarks with a quotation from Horace. Is that correct sir? Quite correct, Aynesworth. Good work, Wilton. Carry on, Cole. Hey Dave, isn't it time you took over instead of lying there like, like Cleopatra. Oh I'd love to Johnny old boy, only you're so much better with that pole than I am. You wouldn't want me to pour in the pond, would you John? Oh all right you lazy son of a, but don't go to sleep. I'll give you some wingspans. What's a 109? 32. And a 1-1-0? 53? Sure wish I had your memory. No, it's my brains you want, chum. Oh rot, it's not brains that make a pilot. It's blokes like me. Bet you I make a better pilot than you do. Don't make me laugh. How much you like to bet? Anything you like. An even quid? All right. Who'll be the judge? You won't need a judge, it'll be pretty obvious, I'll tell you that now. All right then, an even quid that I make a better pilot than you. Hey Johnny, what the devil are you doing? I was thinking about tomorrow's navigation exam. If I'm not sitting next to you, I'm sunk. Well there's no need to sink the boat. I'm stretching wood. You've only got about 10 feet of ruddy wood in your hand John. Good lord, so I have. Hey John. Huh? Rather nice. Sit down, please. Uh no, let me see. I think perhaps we better have you in alphabetical order. Aynesworth, will you take this desk here? The rest of you, sort yourselves out. You'd better get it into your head right away that good navigation's essential for any pilot. Fighter, bomber, or crystal. Yes, sir. I hope you won't fail me, sir. If you let me through, I'll do everything to get up to scratch. All right Aynesworth, we'll accept your promise and give you a pass. But if you let me down... I won't, sir. I promise from now on I'll spend all my spare time on navigation. You're a friend of young Wilton's aren't you? Yes, sir. Now he's worked really hard in his navigation. Did us a damn good paper. Why didn't you copy him? Well I think he did try, sir. While you're here, you'll receive between seven to 12 hours flying. Then your ability as a pilot will be carefully assessed on a system of marks. Right, are there any questions? Excuse me sir, what happens if some of these other chaps don't go solo, does it mean they won't be pilots? By no means, they'll have a better chance, that's all. That goes for you too. Watch your airspeed Smith, watch your airspeed. Just put your googles down, will you. Keep her nose on the horizon, keep her steady. Watch your airspeed, Smith. Keep your nose on the horizon, keep it on the horizon. Watch your airspeed. Your airspeed, watch it. Sir! Sir! Smith. Yes sir. Pull those googles down, will you? Yes sir. Now, do you know why that happened just now? No sir. You don't think it might have been due to your pulling the nose up? Pulling the nose up, sir? Yes Smith, pulling the nose up. Is that what I did, sir? Yes Smith, that is what you did. Well, well, glory be. As you say Smith, glory be. Could we just try it once again? And Smith put those googles down will you! That was a pretty nice turn, Wilton. Now try and make another landing by yourself. If you remember what I told you, you'll find it's quite easy. All right, sir. Never mind Wilton, it happens to the best of us. You made a good recovery. Have another crack at it. Well apart from Smith they seem to be coming along all right. Wilton's a bit of a puzzle, sir. Oh, how's that? Well I don't know, he's a good lad, very quick and keen. I like him a lot but his landings are still ruddy awful. Well I'll see him when I test him. What about the other chap? Aynesworth? Yes. Oh he's absolutely crackerjack. I've only given him 5 1/2 hours and I want you to test him for solo. You're just shooting a line, go away. Oh uh, by the way sir, is there any chance yet of my being put into a squadron? How many times have you asked me that in the last six months? Oh about, about three times sir. Six times a week at least I'd say, and the answer's still no. Get back back to that crackerjack pupil of yours, I'll be seeing him in the morning. Yes sir. Come on sir, let's go before he sees you've been watching. Okay. Good work, Johnny boy. Where are Fergi and the CFI, I thought they were watching. The went into tea quite a time ago. Good lord, do you mean to say they didn't even see it? What do think, you silly clod? Oh. I'll give 'em tea. Looks as though my quid's in danger. Oh that's all right, Fergie's always holding you up as an example of how to fly. No kidding? No kidding. My landings are so ruddy awful. Don't you worry, they'll be all right. God bless you. Colby. Goodbye, sir. Good luck. Well goodbye sir, and thank you very much. All the best. Before we go sir, couldn't you really tell us how we've done sir? No, you'll hear soon enough at the distribution center. But Wesley when I had my final test the CFI told me he'd never seen anything at all like it in my life sir. Did he really say that? Yes. Well, well well. Well goodbye sir, we'll be seeing you. - Goodbye, sir. - Goodbye. Goodbye. Well so long, sir. Drop me a line, will you boys? - Yeah, - We will, sir. I bet the next lot won't be as good as uh, we were sir. Thanks boys. So long fellows. 9-8-1-2-5-9-0, Saunders, D.N., air bomber. 9-8-5-7-6-5-4, Aynesworth, J.A.F. Sir! Pilot. 9-8-3-2-4-6-7, Cartwright, R.O. Sir! Navigator. 9-8-4-6-3-2-1, Smith, A.D. Sir! Air bomber. 9-8-4-3-2-6-5... Must be bloody well crazy. Harrison, J. Sir! Pilot. 9-8-7-8-9-6-3, Wilton, D.W. Sir! Pilot. 9-8-5-6-5-9-1, Stop that. Royston, S.O. Sir! Pilot. The men whose names I have just read out and those previously selected as pilots will leave these sunny shores and proceed to the United States for training. Navigators and air bombers will go to Canada. California here I come. If there's anything you don't understand, for heaven sake don't be afraid to ask questions. That's what we're here for, to help you. Well fellows, when I call your names out, leave the ranks and join your instructors over here. Cadets Johnson, Caper, Lorning, and Mills. Instructor John Larimore. Lloyd, Thompson, Shaw, and Keeble, Instructor Bill Bryant. Well my name is Dean MacWilliams. Just soon as you can get used to it I want you to call me Dean. Yes sir, I mean yes... Dean. Yes, Dean. Now come on, we'll have a look at the ship. Oh uh, course you fellows say aircraft. No, aircraft. Oh, I'm sorry, come on. Well here she is, whatever we call her. And that's the tail, this is the wings, that's the fuselage. And that twisted thing up there in the front, that's a prop. Kind of elementary, eh son? Well we've, we have seen an aircraft before, you know. Well then what would you say was the function of the fuselage? Well I suppose it's, well I mean, well I suppose I don't know. Well what is its function? To keep the wings from touching the tail I'd say. How long should it be before we go solo, sir? Well a minimum of eight hours dual. Eight hours, but I've, well some of us have already gone solo. Well then you, some of you, shouldn't find it difficult to make it in the time. The maximum is 10 hours. Well what happens if we don't make it, sir? Don't worry, you'll make it all right. Come on, David. We don't seem to be able to get those landings of yours right yet, do we David? No, I'm sorry Dean. Well cheer up and don't look so worried. Sorry. And don't be so sorry about everything. No I'm so, no. Uh tell me uh, do you ever get away from camp? Well... Go out and enjoy yourself? No, not much. Well what about coming down to my ranch this weekend, meet the wife? Well yeah, I'd like to. As a matter of fact, we always adopt a couple of you fellows on each course, just like the rest of the folks do around here. How would you like me as a foster parent? Well I'd like it very much. Okay then, I'm it. Now uh, who else shall we adopt? Have you got any particular pal? Well yes, there is someone I'd rather like to bring along. That is if it's all right with you. Of course it's all right, who is it? Well it's John Aynesworth. Oh, well uh, tell me uh, do I get in that guy's hair as much as he gets into mine? Well, he, he's all right when you get to know him. At least I like him. Well we've all gotta make our little sacrifices I guess. I'll adopt the little rat. Yeah, Oliver, that was his name. Got the DSO for that low level raid on Amein. Uh 21 course I think it wa, uh, will you stop bobbing up and down like that. Sit down John, pay no attention to that husband of mine. He never did have any manners of his own. Oh is that so? Yes darling, that is so. David, pass down the cheese, will you? Yeah, sure. Well uh, this Oliver kid was flying solo one day, he had just about three hours to his cre, what's the matter with the cheese? Oh nothing, nothing at all. Well don't you want any? Yes sir, I'd love some after I finish my pie. Well why after? Isn't that the orthodox way of eating cheese? Here John, you try some, it's awful good. Oh I see, this is the orthodox way. You know kid, you give me one hell of an inferiority complex. You know you give me one to. Do I? Is that so? Well, well, what do you know about that? Well. Don't look so pleased about it, honey. Go on about Oliver. Oh yeah, well this Oliver kid was flying solo one day when his fuel started to give out. Good, isn't it? Uh Mary, give him some more. Well what do you think this Oliver kid did? Well he cut off his engine, called up the control tower and said, "What do I do now?" Well if you all will excuse me, I really must go wash those dishes. Oh I'll come and help you. Oh sit down, you can't wash dishes. Oh rot, I wash a very pretty dish. That's right John, you come along and help. Just ignore this husband of mine. Well can you beat that? His lordship volunteering to wash dishes. You know David you were right, he's not such a bad guy once you get to know him. Yeah I knew you'd like him. Swell pilot too. Is he really? Yeah, but don't tell him I said so. He'll be better still when he learns that the more you learn about flying, the more you have to learn. Yeah but John's a natural pilot, isn't he? I mean well he doesn't have to swallow it all up out of books like I do. Oh he could do with a bit more of the book for all that. You know, John and I have got a bet on about who's gonna be the best pilot. Yeah? Which do you think? Well, that'll teach Mary a lesson. What do you say, Marshall? You've flown with him. Well, I'd say the same, sir. The boy has the makings of a first class pilot. His landings are rough because he thinks too much about 'em. Flies too much with his brain, doesn't use his instinct enough. You don't think the trouble might be something more organic? Well Dean doesn't think so. That can only be a hunch, Dean. Well sure, but my hunches aren't usually all that wrong. No, they're not. All right then, what do you suggest? Let me give him another half hour's duo. He's only got that left anyway, what then? Then we send him solo. Supposing he doesn't improve in that half hour? Well I want you to let me send him solo anyway. Well that's a risk Dean I'm not too keen to take. Well he recovers well, his airmanship is first class, he doesn't lose his head. You haven't answered my objection, Dean. Well, look sir, here's the way it is. I hate to see first class pilot material go to waste. This is a case where I think a slight risk is justified. In my opinion the kid is suffering from just one thing, lack of confidence. And the only way you and I or anybody else can give it to him, is to send him solo. What do you think, Marshall? I agree, sir. All right Dean, provided you pay for a new steerman. Okay David, feel like taking her up alone? Oh thanks, thanks a lot Dean. Well do a circuit and come in again. Uh, let me know how you get on, I'll be having a cup of coffee in the canteen. Yeah, I know. Ready for me now, Dean? What? Oh uh, you take 0-3 on your own. Do half an hour circuits and bumps. Okay. How did David get on? Why don't you taxi like that? Too impatient. Damn good takeoff. Well at least he's opened up again, most of 'em don't do that. You okay? Yeah I think so. Take it easy, don't hurt yourself David. You're darn lucky to get away with this so easy. You're not kiddin'. Dave, you big twerp. I'm sorry, sir. No, forget it, you all right? Well yeah, I think so sir. Well why didn't you go around again? Well I, I had to go down sometime. Well he's not hurt, sir. Good, what about that hunch of yours now, Dean? All right, when the MO's okayed him, take him up again, give him a good workout. Very well sir. Come on son, we're going for a little joy ride. There's nothing wrong with your nerve. Good. No, it's not good at all. I thought your trouble was under-confidence. I was wrong. What is my trouble then? I don't know. All I know is it's something that I can't cure. Do you mind if I have a cigarette, please. Here, have one of mine. Oh, thank you. Dean, what you're trying to tell me is that I'm never gonna make a flyer, huh? Oh no, you'll make a flyer all right, but uh, you won't make a pilot. I only wanna be a pilot. There are other things. I don't care about other things. Here. Now look David, you have no judgment of height. And that's one thing a pilot's just got to have if he wants to live. I'm sorry kid but that's the way it is. Couldn't you put me on the next course? Oh sure but it'd be just a waste of your government's money and my time. Sorry kid, I know just how you feel. I wanted to be a pilot more than I've ever wanted anything in my life. Say, what's all this pilot stuff anyway? Whoever said being a pilot was such a wonderful thing? You're a pilot aren't you? Yeah but heck, that was in the last war, it was different then. The pilot was king, the rest was nobody, but now, well what is a pilot but just a darn chauffer anyway? Say, if I had my chance again, do you know what I'd rather be even more than a pilot? Do you know? What? A navigator. Sure, I'm not kidding. It's the navigator in these big ships who gets all the medals these days. Oh but hell, every member of a bomber crew is just as important as the pilot, you oughta know that. That's what they told me at my selection board. Well they mighta been right, son. Did you ever think of that? No, no I'm afraid I didn't. I was pretty sure I was gonna be a pilot. Sure got 30 minutes solo, Dean. Oh sorry. I quit, Johnny. Dave! Just made it. I thought you were flying. Well I am, at least I'm suppose to be. Well now, just thought I'd come see you off, Dave. Thanks Johnny. Well, goodbye. Hey now, wait a second, I have got that address you gave me, haven't I? Yeah, I wrote it down for you about five times. Well that's good, I've got it somewhere. Now remember Dave on the way home, I'm coming to have that drink with you in Toronto. If you get the chance. Oh we'll fix that all right. Hey buddy, you wanna miss that train it's okay by me. Bye Johnny. So long, Dave. Be a good little navigator. Oh I almost forgot, it's what I owe you. Don't spend it all at once. First of all, the master unit. Now this is stowed usually near the tail in heavy aircraft so that it's as far away as possible from the magnetic influences of the engine and other metal parts of the fuselage. Now another important point is the fact that being jiral controlled, the compass is unaffected by bank, and you can get an immediate reading on the repeaters when turning. Dear Dave, thanks for the letter. Yesterday we were given our wings, and now I suppose we can call ourselves pilots. Feels pretty good I can tell you. We're due to go back to England right away, but we're getting embarkation leave first, so you can expect to see me in Toronto quite soon. Ten! Come in. Well Wilton, what do you want? I'm on flying tonight, sir. Yeah you're flying with me, aren't you fellow? Yes sir. I'd like to swap with somebody who's on tomorrow night sir. Why? Well I've got a particular reason for wanting to go to town tonight, sir. What's she like? It's not a she sir, it's a pal of mine, he's on embarkation leave. He's on his way through and it's the only night he's got, sir. Sorry Wilton, no dice. Baxter's ready to swap with me, sir. I know, I know, but supposing flying is scrubbed tomorrow night. I have a carefully planned program here, I can't afford to take chances. And besides, you're not well enough advanced in your work to be fooling around. All right sir, I'm sorry I asked. No harm asking. No sir. Tell you what, I'm driving to town soon as I've changed, you can come along with me and we can see this pal of yours and explain things, what do you say? Thank you, sir. Thanks for the lift, sir. Okay, I'll come in with you. See him? No sir. Well let's sit down over there and have a drink while we're waiting. Couple of cokes, please. By the way, I've arranged for your friend to sleep at the camp tonight. Oh, thank you sir. Paging Mr. Wheeler, paging Mr. Wheeler. Cigarette? Oh, thank you sir. How long you been over this side? Oh, nearly six months all together. Looking forward to getting back I bet. Not all that much. How come? I don't know I, hoped to go back with something up here. You will. Yeah, but not what I hoped for. Johnny! Hello, Dave. Oh, good work Johnny, I knew you'd make it. Sit down. Oh, Flight Lieutenant Moore, Jo, uh, Sergeant Aynesworth. How do you do, sir? Glad to know you, fellow. You have a coke? Oh thanks. Another one, please. All right, sir. Feeling cold? Oh, no sir. Take off your coat. Yes. Johnny. Yeah. May I? Oh, oh yes I suppose they are a bit dazzling. Thank you, sir. Just a minute, Aynesworth. You um, you know this guy Wilton pretty well, don't you? Yes, yes I do. Well enough to give him a good hard kick in the seat of his pants? I think so, sir, why? He's making a fool of himself over his work here. It's the old story of the disappointed pilot. Worst case I've met so far. Thinks navigating's a sissy job. All right sir, I'll see what I can do. Might do more good coming from you. How bout coming up with us in the ensign tonight, there'll be room. Thanks, I'd like to sir. Okay, I'll fix it. So long. Cheerio, sir. 3/10ths cloud at 8000, wind at 2000, 240, 15. At 4000, 250, 20. Now there's a cold front approaching from the west, and it's possible that it may reach this area before the end of the exercise, so be prepared for a recall signal. This cold front is causing snow flurries and a marked varying in increase in the strength of the wind at the cold front. Any questions? All right, sir, that's all. All right, sir. See you later. You taking a navigation instructor up with you? No why, scared? Yeah I certainly will be if you're doing all the navigating. Ah, don't worry, we won't get lost. Apart from Moore being the best staff pilot in the station, we're takin' Instructor Wallace up and the UT Wallace up with us. We can always get in on a beam. I'm glad to hear it. Hello. Oh hello, Aynesworth. Ah-ha, very pretty, what's it gonna be, bombers or fighters? Bombers. Bombers eh, hm. Less driving, more of a bore. Carry on. Is he flying with us? Yeah, I always try to fly with old Smith, he does my map reading for me. Are you mad? Whatever he was like as a pilot, he's a damn good air bomber. I'll believe that when I see it. Hi, Wilton. What time they say take off was? Uh, 21:15. Oh thanks. Percy's our wireless op tonight, Johnny. Oh, how do you do? I'm fine. Well, must press on, see you later. It's a wonderful crew you've got, Dave. Yeah. Pilot to navigator, recall signal, give me a course for base. Looks like the weather's closing in on us. Yeah. Navigator to pilot, steer course 2-3-1 compass. Estimated time of arrival base 01:33, 01:33. Pilot to navigator, ETA base, 01:33. Hello pilot, navigator calling. ETA in three minutes time. Start losing height now. Hello navigator, pilot answering, going down now. Maintaining course. Have you got me that bearing? Have you got me that bearing? It's no use son, receiver's US, can't get a thing. Ah well never mind, we're bound to be pretty well over the airfield. See anything, sir? The airfield lights should be dead ahead. Nothing dead ahead fella except a hell of a lot of rocks and boulders. It's four minutes past your ETA, what do we do now? Well the airfield must be dead ahead of us. I think, sir. No use just thinking fella, what do you want me to do? Hello navigator, still nothing to be seen. Where do we go from here? Navigator to pilot, carry on. Next course 2-7-0 compass, 2-7-0 compass. Hello wireless operator, still no joy? Still no luck with the receiver, transmitter's working okay. Lotta use that is. Hello navigator, we've exactly 45 minutes fuel left, 45 minutes fuel left. Yes sir, we've taken several bearings on 'em and they vary so much, he must be doing a square search somewhere north of the airfield. Yes sir, all air drone lights are on. Okay sir, I'll do that. Sergeant, send a broadcast to all airfields within a hundred mile radius, prepare for possible forced landing. Okay, sir. Hello, George, George, telephone police will you and ask them to have their patrol look out for that overdue ensign. Okay, thanks. Getting us yet? No, sir. Keep on trying, eh? Hello navigator, 20 minutes fuel left, 20 minutes fuel left. You still want me to continue course? Well, I, I-I don't know, sir. Do whatever you think best. You're navigator, you know. Checked your DR again? Um, yes. Air plot up to date? Uh, yes. Sure you applied variation the right way? Yes, I'm quite sure. So we should be over the airfield, shouldn't we? Yes, sir. Well we aren't, are we? No, sir. What wind are you using? Uh, uh, 2-4-5-20, sir. Oh my gosh. We, we, we had a recall signal, sir. Really, how very interesting. Yeah, that's right, we had a recall signal. Well, well there must have been a change of wind. Take your time, eh, we've got all of 15 minutes fuel left. Navigator to pilot, steer 1-7-4 compass, 1-7-4 compass. 1-7-4 it is, I'm climbing, just in case. Five minutes to go, he'd better be right this time. Trust your navigator, fellow, it's an old principle of flying. Lights, dead ahead sir! All right, no need to panic. Nice work, navigator. An hour and 20 minutes past our ETA, but we're home. You coming, Dave? Yeah you go on, I'll see you at the interrogation. Funny, for the first time tonight I felt sick in the air. I know a bloke who feels sick after every trip over Germany, he's a navigator too. It's a hell of a feeling, knowing that everyone's relying on you. Pilots feel like that too, you know. Yeah I suppose everyone on an air crew gets it sometime or another. Only it's worse for the navigator 'cause he gets it all the time is far worse for the pilot. What? The pilot? What did the pilot do I'd like to know, except take off, land, and keep on a course? Any outfit can be taught to do that. Oh right, you know damn well it's the pilot. Now you take our Moore tonight, pilot with bags and bags of experience and what could he do except hold on to the ruddy stick and say, "Where are we?" Of course I know he gave me the wind change, but even so, who got you home? You did. That's right. Oh, well yes I'm, I'm sorry sir, I didn't mean to shoot a line, only he was shootin' a line about pilots. Was he? That's all right, Wilton, guess there's no harm in being proud of getting us back tonight. That's your job, after all. Not a bad thing to be proud of your job. No sir, I suppose not. Better get along fellow, they're waiting for you at interrogation. Yes, sir. See you in the morning, Johnny. Okay, get out of here. Good night, sir. Good night. He'll make a navigator all right, just needed showing, that's all. Bit lucky he had such a shaker tonight, wasn't it? Yes, I guess it was a bit lucky. I noticed the fuel after we got down, we had at least half an hour left. Sure, they always give you a good margin on these trips. Did you notice anything else? Was there anything else to notice? Only a little yellow light on the horizon the first time we came down. When he seemed so darn confident of hitting the airfield on ETA. What was it? The airfield. This is where I get some sleep, goodnight Sergeant. Goodnight, sir. Now smile, hold it. Thank you. Johnny! Good lord, you go on chaps, I'll follow. Well, well, well it's grand to see you again, Dave. How are you? Oh fine, thanks. Oh Johnny you are a louse really, you might have told me. Oh well they dish 'em out all over the place these days, you know. Oh I don't believe that, what happened? Oh the usual sort of muck up, landed on the wrong airfield on the way back from Hamburg, and went off the kite. Well tell me Dave, how's the girlfriend? Oh she's fine, sends you her love. That's nice of her, Dave. Look Dave I, I did try my best to wag you on to the crew but... Yeah I heard about it from the navigation officer. Thanks for trying anyway. You see the trouble is now the fellow's already got some up experience, and the others, the fellows on the crew... Oh that's all right Johnny, you don't have to explain. Look, we're going out to the pub tonight for a bit of a booze up, how bout coming along? Yeah, I'd love to. Good, I'll collect you at the mess. Well so long Dave, glad the old firm is showing up again. So am I. I don't know what you're talking about. The starboard outer wasn't giving me the correct boost. We therefore developed a slight sway... Mack, you mean you're two hand with the rudder. If you'd look after your ruddy engine as well as I fly the ruddy guy, there wouldn't be any bother. Ah, now don't give us that, those guys don't fly themselves. What a line. What a lot of ungrateful - ...you are. - The iceberg man. Hello, sir. Hello. I'm awfully sorry, I'm afraid I... Wilton, sir, grading school, course 1-3-6. Good lord, yes of course. It was that thing that fooled me. I must say, yeah. Are you part of this squadron now sir? Me in a squadron? No, no occasionally they allow us inspectors a couple of weeks in an operational station. We might even get a real trip in a real bomber. I think they do it to save us from going completely mad. Tell me what happened to that fellow, that friend of yours? - Aynesworth? - Yes. Oh he's here sir, he's captain over Lancaster. That's why I got myself posted to this squadron. It's a bit of luck there. Yes, I suppose it is. It's like that, is it? Yes, it's like that. You see we've got a bloke in the pool now who's already done a trip or two. We've no vacancies at the moment, I suppose we shall just have to stick you in the pool and you can carry on with your training. Carry on with my training sir? I thought all that was over. Hm, sure you did. So did I when I first joined the squadron. Well I'm just completing my second tour of office. You can take it from me, Wilton, the training's only over when you're dead. Not one second before. Come on, I'll fix you up with some tea. Last night for the third time this week, very strong forces of our air bomber command delivered another concentrated attack upon the inland port of Bramer. In addition to high explosive bombs, 200,000 incendiaries were sent down. RAF pilots report that the fires were still visible when they... Good morning Sergeant Wilton. Oh good morning, sir. You're the very bloke I've been looking for. You're flying with Aynesworth tonight. What sir? I'm putting you on Aynesworth's crew. His navigator stopped a bit of flare the night before last. Nothing serious, but he'll be out of it for a bit. Oh thank you sir, thank you very much. Don't thank me, you're the only spare navigator. Oh, oh I see sir. Briefing, 17:45. Yes, sir. Good luck. Thank you, sir. Johnny. Hello Dave, how's things? Oh fine, thanks. - Hello, sir. - Hello. Johnny, I'm flying with you tonight. Are you? Oh well that, that's fine. Hey chaps, come over here. Fellows, you all know David Wilton. Hi. Well uh, Dave's navigating for us tonight. Good show. Well, well, I better go and get my things together I suppose. See you at the briefing, Johnny. Fine. So long. So long, kid. Holy suffering cats. Where is it tonight, skipper, do you know? Well I've only heard the rumor. So have I, that makes it ruddy suicide. Wish I'd bags and bags more life insurance. What you all binding about? I happen to know your skipper's right when he says he's a crackerjack navigator. That's all right for you sir, you don't have to fly with him. No, I don't have to, but I'm going to. I could've flown with the CO, but I fixed it to fly with you boys instead. Well, cheerio chaps, I'll see you later. The pathfinders will be there already. The weather's good, we hope. So you should have no difficulty in finding the target. So bring it, and bring it hard. As usual, I can't emphasize too much the importance of sticking bang on track. For one thing, if you break away from the main body, you'll most likely be picked off by fighters. And for another, if you vary from this particular course, you'll more than likely run into these very highly defended areas and get into a lot of trouble, which is entirely unnecessary. So navigators, keep on the top line. I think that's all. All right chaps, good luck. Oh hell. What's the trouble, mate? Oh I'm not going. It's Berlin, so the ruddy gunnery officer's going to take my place. What a nerve that man's got. What are you beefing about? You don't know when you're in luck. Berlin with a navigator as green as my, oh that's all right, he didn't hear. Anyway, it's not his fault. It's just our tough luck, that's all. Come on. Coming Donnie? Look Angus. Pull your finger out, skipper? Ready Dave? Yeah, yeah sure. Here, let me give you a hand. We should film onto the Palace this week with my girl tomorrow night, what do you think? Yeah, I'd like to. Navigator to pilot, ETA Danish coast, 01:22, 01:22. ETA Danish coast 01:22. Wireless op to pilot, lighters have just gone off the air. Good show. Pilot to all positions, we are approaching the enemy coast. Keep a sharp lookout for fighters and report anything you see. Not much chance of seeing anything in this murky weather. Air bomber to pilot, testing intercom. 1-2-3-4-5-6-7 all good air bombers go to heaven. Can you hear me with that? I hear you sonny boy. Okay skipper. Hello navigator, 'fraid I still can't give you a pinpoint, can't see a ruddy thing down below. Okay air bomber, thanks. How's it coming, nav? All right, I think. Navigator to pilot, steer course 1-3-0 compass, 1-2-5 true, 1-3-0 compass, 1-2-5 true. Okay, navigator, course 1-3-0 compass, 1-2-5 true it is. Reception committee's out over Berlin all right. Hell of a lot of stuff coming up. We've got stuff going down too by the look of it. Bomb door's open. Fighter flares above us, fighter coming in port quarter, skipper. I got him, I got him. Go on, Curly. Left, left, skipper. Left a little more. More, hold it there, skipper. Steady, right a little more, skipper. Hold it there. Keep it there, skipper. Bombs going in a second, skipper. Steady. Hold it there, skipper. Steady. Bomb's gone. Port half engine's on fire. There's still a fire, skipper. I know. Monitor all positions. Engine on fire, I'm gonna try and put it out by diving. It's out, it's out, skipper. Pilot to all teams, fire's out, we've only two good engines left. That's okay, did you see that 1-1-0 go down? You bet I did. Bloody marvelous wasn't it? Angus, how's our fuel? Not so good, skipper. Looks like the tank's been holed. Have we enough to get us back? Just about, it depends of course. Okay, we've two engines and just enough fuel. I'm taking yon home, boys. Good for you, Johnny. Okay skipper, that's the stuff, I've got a date tonight. We'll be out of this stack in a second, chaps. What's the damage? Wireless has copped out, skipper, no joy at all. Transmitter working? I think so. At least I hope so. The nav aids have gone as well. Then we'll just have to run on our navigator. It's lucky we got such a good one. Holy suffering cats. Keep your eyes open for pinpoints, Curly. Curly's been hit, skipper. Is he badly hurt? It doesn't look too bad but he's unconscious and he's bleeding pretty heavily. I think we better bring him up top. Right, I'll be relying on you, Dave. Give me a direct course to the nearest landing field. Okay, skipper. Where are we? How's the fuel? How's the fuel? 45 minutes at the most. Engine temperatures are climbing too. We've only 45 minutes fuel left at the most. What's your ETA? Tell you in a minute. It doesn't look too good, we're losing height steadily. How's Curly? Fairly comfortable. Dinghy, dinghy prepare for ditching. We've only three minutes chaps, pack up. Rear gunner to pilot. Right mid upper to pilot, okay chief. Wireless op to pilot, message received and understood. Navigator, get weaving and work out our position. And for Pete sake get it right. Navigator to pilot, okay skipper. How's it going, Dave? Just finished, skipper. My mother always said I had to get my feet wet. Navigator to pilot, surface wind 2-6-0-20, 2-6-0-20. Right. Ditching stations, ditching stations. Wireless op to ditching station. Okay skip, wireless op to ditching station. Hold tight fellows, here it comes. Brace for ditching! Here get this, Pete. Okay chap, I've got it. Get his arm, Angus. Okay skipper, coming up. All right. I've got him. Get inside and hurry, chaps. What do you got in there? Here, here, over here. Hurry up mates, this is going. Hey, wait for me, fellas. Come on boys, we'll all be. Hey look out Angus! Grab that vest. Use your hand, mateys. Got him? Yeah, okay? Cut him free, Dave. Okay, skip. How you feeling, Curly? Where are we? Well that's just it Curly boy, where the hell are we? Dave's got it all worked out, Curly. Haven't you Dave? Yeah, sure. I've changed it again, we're in exactly the same position to about half a mile. Yeah see rescue chaps'll be here any minute now. Heck they'd better be, I've got a date with the AOC tomorrow about my commission. Air marshals get awful mad if you keep 'em waiting. Well that's one air marshal booked for the looney bin. Oh for god sake Angus shut up. If you want to be gloomy go and talk to the fishes. All right, all right, can't you take a joke? No, not Scotch ones I can't. Now Dave, take a look at the bag, it doesn't seem to be leaving much of a trail. Yeah, okay. Well that's better. You're suppose to be able to see that 10 miles away. What's today, Tuesday? Aye, it should be, if we haven't drifted over the international date line. Good lord, did someone say it was Tuesday? I was suppose to be going on a gunnery leader's course this afternoon. Relax bud, they won't start without you. Well I hope they do. Tonight of all night's I've got me a red hot date. Redhead? You bet, with a temper like a rattlesnake. I muff it this time, our navigator'll have to do the explaining. Hear that, Dave? Sure. What about me, chaps? I'm getting married on Thursday. - Married? - You are? - You're kidding. - Go on with you. Harry, that's serious. You wouldn't be pulling our legs by any chance? No, cross my heart. Looks like the wee wifey's gonna be awful lonely on her wedding night. Shut up, Angus. I'm sorry, bub. Sorry, for what? You can all come to my wedding feast, if the rations hold out. Keep grinding on that radio, Pete. Not much use without the cart ariel, skipper. Well keep on trying anyway, you never know. Okay, skip. Stop grinding that machine, Pete. Is that a? My god it is. Quickly Angus, fire that flaring pistol. Hey Pete, they're signaling. Rescue launch here in two hours. That's the stuff, nice work chaps. They're still signaling, Pete. Navigator pretty well dead on fix. That's all skipper. Good show, Dave. Well done, Dave. Hey, it looks like we'll have to hang on to this navigator, skipper. Maybe who were ditched in the Pacific. You miserable blat, you. Nice navigating, Dave. Well that's all right, you got us down in one piece. The old firm, eh? Yeah, the old firm. Hey wait a moment. What about me, don't I get any credit for having helped train you both? - Certainly not? - What for? Well you, you couple of ungrateful...
