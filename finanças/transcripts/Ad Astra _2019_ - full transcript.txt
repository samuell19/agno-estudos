I'm calm, steady. I slept well. 8.2 hours. No bad dreams. I am ready to go. Ready to do my job to the best of my abilities. I am focused only on the essential, to the exclusion of all else. I will make only pragmatic decisions. I will not allow myself to be distracted. I will not allow my mind to linger on that which is unimportant. I will not rely on anyone or anything. I will not be vulnerable to mistakes. Resting BPM, 47. Submit. Your psychological evaluation has been approved. As a reminder, please perform any safety and equipment checks... I always wanted to become an astronaut... for the future of mankind and all. At least, that's what I always told myself. I see myself from the outside. Smile, present a side. It's a performance... with my eye on the exit. Always on the exit. Just don't touch me. Take care, Major. Be careful. Thanks for that. Roy, Bravo post has got a robotic arm on 93 Echo... appears to be malfunctioning. We're gonna need you to take a team down there and check it out. Run some diagnostics. Over. Copy that. Heading that way. Good morning to our astronauts up there on the International Space Antenna. Sure is a beautiful day. Just perfect to try and contact... our distant neighbors out there in the heavens. At least it's comfortable out here. I got some scores here. Let's see, it was Iowa State over Kansas, 35 - 16. Space I understand. Control, I have visual on the arm. Over. Affirmative, Major. Proceed. Copy that. Moving to the unit now. Control, I'm seeing a power surge on C-post. You getting that? Uh... Roger that, Roy... Control, we got a lot of people up there. Over. Control. Control, I think we have some spikes... Please just stand by, we're working the issue. Just stand by. Control, they're happening everywhere. Command, cutting power. Get off the tower now! You've gotta bail out! Oh, my God! Control, McBride. I'm in a spin. Atmosphere's too thin to stabilize. I'm trying to keep the tumble down, so I don't black out. Control, do you read? "A self-destructive side." That's what she used to say to me. I should feel something. I survived. I should feel something. In what has become known as "The Surge"... a series of destructive electrical storms has wreaked havoc across the globe... and scientists are concerned we've not seen the last of them yet. Their origin? Outer space. The cause? Unknown so far... This is a message from SPACECOM. In light of the recent catastrophe... your attendance is required for a debrief... to be held in Building 91, Vandersteen Base. Please note, this meeting will be classified "top secret." Roy, how are you? Thanks for coming in. Appreciate it. General. This is Lieutenant General Rivas, Director of - U.S. SPACECOM Special Ops. - Hi. - Sir. - Major. Adjutant General Vogel, head of Security. - Major. - Ma'am. They flew all the way in from Virginia just last night, just to see you. Well, thank you. Your, uh, profile is certainly very impressive. You've done exceptionally well on all the assessment tests. Basic combat, space training. Just exceptional across the board. The rumor is that your pulse rate has never gone above 80... in any of the spacewalks, skywalks, and even on this most recent fall. Is that correct? Well, so far, sir. That's very impressive. According to this, married once, no children? Yes, sir. It's dangerous business, as we know. Best not to subject others to it. Fair enough. Well, we didn't bring you in here to talk about your fall, Roy. We have something... of a highly classified nature to show you. Please have a seat, Major. Yes, ma'am. What you are about to see are spectrogram images of Neptune. These are cosmic ray bursts. That was taken just 11 days ago. It released high-energy particles... that caused a catastrophic power surge all over the world. And that's what almost killed you. The rays grow stronger as they radiate towards us here on Earth. Major, what can you tell us about the Lima Project? First manned expedition to the outer solar system, sir. Some 29 years ago, as you know. And the commander was... He was my father, sir. The ship disappeared approximately 16 years into the mission. No data was ever recovered. Deep space missions were halted after that. Yes, that's him. Can you tell us how you handled your father's absence? Well... My mother was certainly distressed by it. Uh, she was quite ill at the time. But he was, uh, committed to his job... and I'm sure it was very difficult for him as well. Roy... we have something that might come as quite a shock to you. We believe your father is still alive near Neptune. Where exactly, we do not know. Now, we've sent out numerous drones, but obviously, it's a vast area to cover. My father's alive, sir? We believe so. Roy, The Surge seems to be the result of some kind of anti-matter reaction. Now, the Lima Project was powered by that material... and your father was in charge of it. Now, we're talking about a potentially unstoppable chain reaction here. The uncontrolled release of anti-matter... could ultimately threaten the stability of our entire solar system. All life could be destroyed. Major, we would like you to send a personal message on Mars by secure laser... to what we hope is the Lima Project. The text of your message would be prepared in advance, of course. Mars, sir? I'm going to Mars? It is the last secure hub we have. Roy, we need to find out just what we're up against here. Our underground Mars base was the only one unaffected by The Surge. And we believe a personal plea, from you to your father, might elicit a response. We can track that signal... locate him and figure out a way to stop this. What is happening out there is a crisis of unknown magnitude. Now, we're counting on you to help us find him. Are you with us? - Yes, I am, sir. - Good. You deploy first to the moon. Our long-range rockets are stationed there on the Far Side. Everything after that will be on a need-to-know basis. Yes, sir. Given the magnitude of the threat... a cover story is being formulated to avoid all panic. You'll be traveling commercially to the moon to keep a low profile. Colonel Pruitt will be your point person from here on. Absolute top secrecy must be maintained. "Are you with us?" Like I have a choice. My dad was a pioneer. He sacrificed himself for the search for intelligent life. My dad was the program. I was 16 when he left, 29 when he disappeared. Archived message, received 27 years... - 3 months, 2 days ago. - And that's that. Roy, this is a message from your father. I'm coming at you from the Lima Project. Just on our way past Jupiter and ultimately on to Neptune. I know you have seen that we have excited real and enormous interest... around the world, and we are grateful for it. We're doing big things up here, real big. Namely, we're about to answer the number one question... when do we find all the intelligent life out there? And we know we will. We're going to the edge of the heliosphere... where the sun's magnetic field won't affect our instruments one bit. We'll be able to examine any star system for complex life. Never been done before, and we sure are optimistic. I feel your energy back home, and of course, I think of God. I'm overwhelmed at seeing and feeling His presence... so close. I love you, my son. Hello, Roy. I'm here to go on this trip with you. Keep my eye on ya. Colonel Pruitt, good to meet you. Actually... we've met. It was a long time ago. I knew your dad. We were close, he and I. We started out together, went to Purdue together. He was a brilliant man. - I know. - Yeah. And I remember going to the house and seeing you. You were running around everywhere. You drove your poor mother nuts, but... How do you feel? Is this part of my psych eval? Uh... No, not really, but yes. I mean, you're going to be monitored constantly... your mental state, your emotional state. You have a direct connection with the subject. Colonel, for what it's worth, I think my father's dead. Yeah, um... I was a lunar astronaut for SPACECOM for 31 years. And I came to the realization out there... a voyage of exploration can be used for something as simple as escape. I'm telling you this, Roy, because we have to hold out the possibility... that your father may be hiding from us. Do you think you're ready to go? I'm ready. All right. Your pre-launch quarantine is almost complete. You have shown no evidence of bacterial or viral infection... So many times in my life, I've screwed up. Although all efforts have been made... I've talked, when I should have listened. I've been harsh, when I should have been tender. In the event of illness or accident... please make certain that you have listed any family members... spouse, or significant other as your next of kin, in your personal file. Volume down. Message. Personal directory. Eve. Hi, Eve, it's Roy. Uh... I'm away again, no surprise there. I just wanted to say... I made a promise to always be truthful. But I wasn't. Listen, I wanted to say... I didn't want you to go. Delete. Cancel. Good morning. I've been trained to compartmentalize. SPACECOM requires you to complete a pre-launch psychological evaluation. It seems to me that's how I approach my life. Resting BPM is 56. Didn't sleep much last night, but it shouldn't be a problem. I remain mission ready. You have been approved for lunar travel. Is it your first time to the moon? No, but it's been a while. Are you planning on traveling outside the secure zone on your visit? No. Again. - How's that? - Okay. - Okay, not too snug? - Yeah, it feels all right. Breathe. Virgin flight 6092, to Tycho Base, Moon, boarding now. Welcome aboard, sir. - I'm Captain Lu. - Thank you. - Hi, Captain. - Watch the step. - Duck your head. - Okay. - Hello, welcome. Flight pack? - Hello. - Yes, thanks. - Great. - Third seat, to your right. - Okay. Excuse me. - Hello. - Hello. We remind you, the moon is borderless. Many mining zones are disputed territory and considered to be in a state of war. Please stay within the restricted, safe area... Excuse me? May I have a blanket and pillow pack please? Sure. $125. Payment accepted. - Thank you. - Thank you. As we approach, some of you can see the grand telescope array... near the Atlas crater. It's the moon's largest facility for extraterrestrial research. Hot towel? - Oh, thank you. - Thank you for flying with us. We do appreciate it. Please prepare for landing. All the hopes we ever had for space travel... covered up by drink stands and T-shirt vendors. Just a recreation of what we're running from on Earth. We are world-eaters. If my dad could see this now... he'd tear it all down. Our rocket is named Cepheus. The crew will be SPACECOM military personnel. They're completely unaware of our mission. We have to keep it that way. The launchpad is on the other side of no man's land. It's very dangerous... so we'll have armed personnel to protect us and escort us to the Far Side. Colonel, can I ask what the last conversation you had with my dad was? It was not very pleasant. We quarreled about my leaving the program. He accused me of being a traitor. And if you were to find him... then what? Is this very difficult for you, son? This being about your father? No. No, my dad's a hero. SPACECOM's trying to impugn a man who's given his entire life to the program. I think it's despicable. Or desperate at best. We are approaching Terminal R, lunar rover hangar. We've been having trouble with pirates since September. Some countries have been giving them safe haven. They'll take hostages or go for our rovers. It's like the Wild West out there... but we'll get you to your spacecraft. This your first time in a war zone? Three years over the Arctic Circle. All right. And a heck of a lot of Army-Navy games. Well, I guess there's not much you haven't seen, right? Well, look, it's almost a full moon. A large stretch of the Far Side's real black, so let's suit up. Lunar Rovers, Group C, set for departure... to the Far Side launch complex through gate 12. Please maintain situational awareness. Rover 7, confirming settings. Bearing two-niner-oh. Roy? Yes, Colonel. Look at it. The big blue marble. Never ceases to amaze me. Lieutenant, you clocking this? Yeah, same here. I can't ID any national markings. Over. - Lieutenant... - At 7 o'clock... Alpha, what do we got here? Alpha, we have what looks like unidentified rovers approaching our position. Possible pirate activity, and I got a couple of VIPs with me. Roger, moving to flank you. Uh, Alpha, we may need some ballistics help up here. Potential hostile situation... Here we go again, fighting over resources. We got two coming up on our rear, 7 o'clock. Appears to be pirates, possibly looking for valuables. We'll send ballistic support ASAP. What the hell am I doing here? Shit! Alpha, we need backup ASAP! We're being ambushed! - Mayday, mayday, mayday! - Give me a weapon! Just hold on! LRV-3 down. LRV-2 down. Alpha, we're gonna go off path to reach the Far Side. I have a puncture! - Roy! - I have a puncture. Roy, you all right? I'm okay. Alpha, repeat, we need... Lieutenant! Oh, Lord! Go, go, go. Hey, break it up. We are not clear. I repeat, we are not clear. We have multiple enemy craft in pursuit. Roy! They're trying to ram us! Command, Lieutenant is KIA. We've lost our escort. Request immediate support. Over. Command, the Lieutenant's body can be recovered... just outside Walther crater. Sorry for the loss. Over. Roger that, Major. Uh, Colonel Pruitt, we're picking up an irregular heartbeat through your system. We suggest you get that checked out immediately. He's supposed to be my security blanket. I'm fine. Why does he still do it? Why can't he just let go? My dad couldn't either. Major, we've been expecting you. If you have any personal business you need to tend to, I suggest doing it now. Your rocket will leave momentarily. Stand down, Sergeant. Yes, sir. Roy, just let me sit down. Colonel, what is it? I'm not going to be able to go with you to Mars. But there are things you need to know, Roy. Every minute counts. Cepheus crew, prepare for pre-launch checks. SPACECOM communicated with me. It is classified. Take it. It will put you at great risk. They do not trust you on SPACECOM. But it is crucial... Sergeant! Commencing pre-launch checks. You have to go, Roy. Go. Go! Captain, Major McBride, com check. Loud and clear, sir. Welcome aboard the Cepheus. I'll be hitching a ride with you if that's all right. Yes, we were alerted, sir. On our way to Mars, the very last stop. We had two joining us? It'll just be one, I'm afraid. Well, we still like you, Major... McBride! I think we might just have ourselves the son of a legend onboard with us, team. Roy, son of Clifford McBride. Oh, wow! How 'bout that? Best in the galaxy. Welcome aboard, sir. They are scientists and technicians... long haulers. Captain, could you contact Control, and ask about the condition of a Colonel Pruitt? Sure, will do now, sir. SPACECOM, could we get a status... They seem at ease with themselves. What must that be like? Major, the Colonel was taken for emergency surgery. - Copy. - Check list complete. They're oblivious to my purpose. Destination, Ersa Research Station, Mars. The last manned outpost in our solar system. Duration 19 days, 14 hours and 33 minutes. Over. Dear Saint Christopher, protect me today in all my travels along the road's way. Give me your warning sign if danger is near. So that I may stop... Perfect, cue the minibar. Command, we're gonna give out the mood stabilizers now. Our psych evals to follow. Frank. 'Cause Lord knows SPACECOM wouldn't want you... getting all emotional on us up here, again. Deavers. Major? Get me one of those, candy man. Captain. Captain, I have a small oxygen leak in my suit. I'm just gonna check my patch. Have fun back there. We'll let you know if we spot any ETs. Hello, SPACECOM. We're out here, Cepheus responding. Smooth sailing. Roger, Cepheus, we have your telemetry. Boys and girls, time for some Cidofovir. A schmear a day keeps the hair away. Nice, Deavers, nice. Back me up, I've never touched the stuff. This is an urgent update for Colonel Pruitt, Thomas F... regarding the status of the Lima Project. SPACECOM believes it has detected a possible SOS signal... from the crew of the Lima Project. The message could indicate that Commander H. Clifford McBride... intentionally disabled all external communications. Under such circumstances... the Commander may have lost all control. If this is the case... and communication cannot be made through his son on Mars... then all other efforts must be undertaken to destroy the Commander... and halt the surges. This message is top secret. What happened to my dad? What did he find out there? Did it break him? Or was he always broken? My father... the most decorated astronaut in the history of the program. U.S. Air Force Academy... his doctorate at MIT. He promised me that one day I could join him in his pursuits... that he'd come back for me. And I believed him. First man to Jupiter. First to Saturn. And then... nothing. Commence slow down, booster three. We're slowing down. Yes, sir. Got a mayday from another craft, sir. Captain, this is a classified mission, we cannot stop. Our destination is Mars. Ersa Station. Major, this is a mayday. Stopping is protocol. Any supply craft can answer that call. The mission is the priority, Captain. Do you not hear what I'm saying? Major, with respect, as I say, we are obligated to stop. As you're merely a passenger, I'm not sure I comprehend your position. 'Course, you are well within your rights to take command of this craft... but if so, you will have to reveal your objectives. Attend to the mayday. Command, craft is registered as Norwegian. The Vesta IX, orbiting asteroid Toro... registered for biomedical research... - on Comet 17-P, Holmes. - Copy. Vesta IX, we're responding to your distress call. Do you read? The distress call is fairly recent. Maybe they were hit by The Surge. Command, possible forced entry to the Vesta required. Either First Lieutenant Stanford or I will take a little spacewalk... and make our way to the craft, over. Yes, sir. Donald, what are you thinking? Wanna go out there? Uh, yeah. Doesn't matter to me. He's scared. Yeah, I know, my suit smells like a locker room, too. Oh, hell, I could use a good stretch anyway. Most of us spend our entire lives in hiding. I'll accompany you, Captain. Very good. Vesta lists 26 souls onboard. Craft registered for biomedical and animal research. Sorry about that little tiff back there, Major. I'm honored to be out here with ya. You know, your dad is the reason why a lot of us are doing what we're doing. He went farther than anybody. He was the best of us. Imagine the things he saw. Imagine. Vesta , this is Cepheus responding to your mayday signal. Do you read? Cepheus, the craft is not responding. Forced entry required. I am now initiating mayday entry code. Vesta , this is Cepheus responding to your mayday. Do you read? Major, I'll take Truss 5. Why don't you start with Truss 2? Don't wander off too far, now. Where is everybody? Vesta , this is Cepheus responding to your mayday. Do you read? Tanner, McBride, check. Tanner, do you copy? Tanner, do you copy? Tanner? Tanner? Repeat, calling for Major McBride. Calling for Captain Tanner. Stay calm. I got you. Make it back. Cepheus, Captain was attacked by a research primate. Emergency medical stand by. Attempting extraction now. Cepheus, this is SPACECOM. Real sorry about that setback. First Lieutenant Stanford is in command of the craft... until Captain Tanner can resume his duties. Over. SPACECOM, this is First Lieutenant Stanford. Captain Tanner is dead. We take comfort knowing that the Captain embraced the rewards... May the angels and the saints come to meet you, as you go forth from this life. May you meet your Redeemer face to face, and enjoy the vision of God forever. Amen. McBride, Roy R. Are you ready for your psychological evaluation? Yes. Please begin. I am on my way to Mars. We answered a mayday call, and... ended in tragedy. We lost the Captain. Your answer is being processed. Please continue. Well, that's it. I mean, we... We go to work, we do our jobs... and then it's over. We're here, and then we're gone. Please describe how the incident itself affected you. The attack... it was full of rage. I understand that rage. I've seen that rage in my father... and I've seen that rage in me. Because I'm angry... that he took off. He left us. You know... but when I look at that anger, if I push it aside and just put it away... all I see is hurt. I just see pain. I think it keeps me walled off... walled off from relationships... and opening myself up and, you know, really caring for someone. And I don't know how to get past that. I don't know how to get around that. And it worries me. And I don't wanna be that guy. I don't wanna be my dad. Your psychological evaluation has been approved. If you wish to obtain a complete... Major, would you commence auto-landing sequence? Copy. SPACECOM, we're approaching Mars. Ersa Station, south. Over. What the hell was that? Is that another surge? I think we just lost primary electrical bus. Switching to bus Charlie. Captain, we're coming in too hot. Our angle's off 20 degrees. I... Warning. Incorrect angle of descent. Go to manual. Warning. Incorrect angle of descent. - Warning. - Go to manual. Incorrect angle of descent. Captain, you need to do something. Incorrect angle of descent. I think I'm, uh... Go to manual. Danger. - Danger. - Initiating manual override. Item 3-2... On my mark, execute. Mark. I have command of the ship. Danger. Danger. 2,000 meters. 1,000 meters. Warning. Incorrect angle of descent. Four... three... two... one. Contact. Engine shut down. Engine saved. Your ship, Captain. Major, would you, uh, start post-landing sequence, please? Copy that. Captain, I believe you understand why I did that. I will not report it to SPACECOM. This is an emergency alert. We have experienced an external power surge. However, all underground systems remain fully operational. And there is no reason for panic. My destination. We repeat, all underground systems are fully operational. Seven weeks since Earth, since air, since sun. Hey, earthlings! Welcome to Ersa Research Station. - Trees and birds. - I'm glad you made it. Thank you. I need your logs please. Thank you. Sir? You got hit by another surge, huh? Thank God we're underground, but the next one could be the big one. I mean, it has been crazy around here. This was my dad's last known stop. Everyone's been running around like it's all gonna end tomorrow. Sir, you can step over here. Put your palm down there. Very good. Thank you. All right, you guys are good to move to the next concourse. The Director will meet you. Thank you. Welcome to the red planet, Major. I'm Helen Lantos, Director of Operations here. Nice to see a new face for a change. Follow me. You should be glad you arrived safely. We had some kind of cosmic storm. We lost three astronauts trying to land. No one knows what's causing them. - Major? - Yes? We're glad you made it. Thanks, Helen, we can take it from here. You're not authorized at this level. Major? Well, thank you. Stand by for secure laser transmission. Attempting top secret link. Range: Neptune. "This is Major Roy McBride. "I'm communicating through a secure laser transmission... "sent from the communications hub "on Ersa Base, North America sector, Mars. "I'm attempting to reach Doctor Clifford McBride. "This is Doctor McBride's son, Roy. "Father, if you can hear me... "I'm attempting to communicate with you. "SPACECOM wants you to know "that they are aware of the disturbances... "and that it cannot be your responsibility. "They would like all information... "about attempts that you are making "to ameliorate the situation. "They would also like to tell you... "they're willing to help and provide "for a rescue mission if possible. "I hope you receive this message. "Over and out." Transmission sent. Awaiting response. Roy, we'll try again next cycle. They're using me. Goddamn them. I don't know if I hope to find him... or finally be free of him. Dad... Dad, I'd like to see you again. I recall how we used to watch black and white movies together... and musicals were your favorite. I remember you tutoring me in math. You instilled in me a strong work ethic. "Work hard, play later," as you said. You should know I've chosen a career that you would approve of. I've dedicated my life to the exploration of space. And I thank you for that. So, I hope we can reconnect. Your loving son, Roy. Transmission sent, awaiting response. Thank you so much, Major, for all your help. We'll be returning you to the Earth in short order. Thank you. Excuse me. Did you get a response from my father? Major, your personal connection has made you unsuited... for continued service on this mission. He answered me, didn't he? Major, we will let you know any details as soon as possible. Roy. Your pulse is very fast. I know! There's also some issues with your biorhythms. Those will need to be addressed before you can safely return to Earth. Would you please follow that man to take a psychological evaluation? Major. Captain. Captain! McBride, Roy R. Are you ready for your psychological evaluation? Yes. How are you feeling in your current state? Good, thank you. I will be returning to Earth soon. I'm content to go home, and... You have failed your psychological evaluation. You will be returned to a comfort room until you are deemed... Contact U.S. SPACECOM. Provide contact and priority code. Request emergency communication with General Stroud. Priority code, Zulu-5-5-Bravo-Papa. Your priority code is no longer valid. Please contact a representative if this restriction is an error. You're going back to Earth now? Can I help you? I've only been there once. As a child. I was born here. But I remember it so well. It was... beautiful. Ma'am, I'd really appreciate my privacy right now. You're here because of the cosmic rays, aren't you? That's classified. The craft you came in, the Cepheus... they want me to requisition it for deep space... with nuclear munitions onboard. Did you know that? It's for a search and destroy mission. I am responsible for more than 1,100 people here. On this base. Now, I need to know. Are we gonna die? I don't know what happens now. I know who you are. You are Clifford McBride's son. Yes. Well, then we're both victims of the Lima Project. My parents left for that expedition. You and I share a great loss, Roy. Please, just tell me. The Cepheus leaves in five hours. You were right. The Surge is coming from the Lima Project. Ultimate catastrophe is very possible. SPACECOM has determined that I am unfit to carry on. That's all I know. I believe your father is alive. They never told you what happened to him out there, did they? U.S. Space Command Top Secret Briefing. Alpha-Papa-4-2-7-8. Communications has received the following mayday call... from the crew of the Lima Project, under the command of H. Clifford McBride. This is Clifford McBride, reporting from the Lima Project. I'm disclosing a tragedy. Here, on the edge of our solar system, some of our people... have been unable to handle the psychological distress... of being so far away from home. They desired to return to Earth, and I could not permit that. And I have to report the reality that they mutinied... committed acts of sabotage trying to commandeer my ship. I was forced to react with equal severity. I disabled one section of our station's life support system... and without doubt, I did punish the innocent along with the guilty. We will not turn back. We will venture further into space. We will find alien intelligence. I am forever driven on this quest. SPACECOM would never allow their image to be shattered... so they made him a hero to protect themselves. Your father murdered my parents. That monster threatens us all. And now it's your burden. Can you get me on that ship? I can get you to the rocket. After that, you're on your own. I will deal with him. I will deal with my father. This is a map of an underground lake beneath the launchpad. You'll be able to access the ship from there. We're approaching. They're gonna come for you, you know. I know. I don't care anymore. I need to get back now, do what I can. Good luck. I'm being pulled, farther and farther from the sun... to you. You're alive. All this time. I must accept the fact I never really knew you. Or am I you... being pulled down the same dark hole? This is Cepheus Launch Control... at T-minus 11 minutes, 7 seconds and counting. Our countdown continuing and still aiming toward a planned lift-off time... at 7:51, UTC. This is Launch Control. Launch is imminent. Final checks from the flight azimuth going on at this time... and we're also synchronizing the clocks to the spacecraft... with the Mission Control Center in Ersa. The engines are armed. Ten, nine... eight, seven, six... five, four... We have commit. ...two, one. Lift-off. We have lift-off. 7:51, UTC. There's a breach. It's the airlock breach. SPACECOM, this is Cepheus. There's been a breach in our airlock. How to proceed? Over. We see that, too. We're checking it out. Stand by. SPACECOM, we need orders, please. Over. McBride for Captain Stanford... Do you read? Jesus, it's McBride. He's breached the goddamn airlock. Captain Stanford, this is Major McBride. I am onboard. I am not a threat. I repeat, I am not a threat. Major, your presence is jeopardizing the mission. Stay where you are! Do not proceed any further. - SPACECOM... - Stand by. SPACECOM, what are your orders? We're determining the course of action here. We're about to switch over to long-range propulsion. Can you neutralize the threat? You'll never make it to Neptune without me. You need me. Neutralize the Major. By any means necessary, you must neutralize the Major. Copy that. Don't listen to them, Captain. I will take all accountability. Major, stay where you are. Do not proceed any further. Do you read? Over. I say again, neutralize the Major... - by any means necessary. - Yoshida, I am not a threat. I am not the enemy. I am on your side. Major, we have our orders. Goddamn it! We're staging! Frank, get out of there! Deavers! - Get back in your seat! - Deavers, please! Son of a bitch! Air contaminated. Get oxygen! Yoshida, oxygen! Ventilator. Ventilator. Breathe. Breathe in! What have I done? Mission, this is Major Roy McBride. I boarded the Cepheus against mission directives. I did not do so with hostile intent. But because of my actions, I regret to inform you... all crew members are now deceased. The flight recorder will tell the story. History will have to decide. I'm en route to Neptune. I remain fully committed... to the completion of the mission... namely to destroy the Lima Project in its entirety. I'm switching off all comms. I'm going dark until final approach to avoid detection. Over and out. Estimated length of journey... 79 days, four hours, eight minutes. You seem really preoccupied with your work. I just feel like I'm on my own all the time. I don't know what we're doing. You're so distant. I mean, even when you're here, I don't know where you are. I feel like I'm looking for you all the time... trying to connect to you, be close to you... and it fucking sucks. You know, I have my own life. I'm my own person. And I can't just wait for you. Feeding tube activated. ...we have excited real and enormous interest... around the world, and we're grateful for it. See, we're doing big things up here. Real big. Namely, we are about to answer the number one question... when do we find all the intelligent life out there? And we know we will, according to the Drake Equation. What you see here is the new starshade, just ready to deploy. You see it opening up just like a prairie flower in the springtime. But I think you are no longer deserving... so I guess... this is goodbye. Roy? ...retired from the program leaves me to doubt not only your judgement, but your character. See, we're just out from Mars now. He's been to Mars? Just on our way past Jupiter... Do you wanna know a secret? ...eventually onto Neptune. ♪ A, you're adorable You have traded... ♪ B, you're so beautiful ...a glimpse of the infinite... ♪ C, you're a cutie full of charms ♪ D, you're delightful and E, you're exciting and I am free of your moral boundaries. I have total clarity. ♪ F, you're a feather in my arms ♪ I am on my way to Neptune... Because we will find our brothers and sisters... The zero G and the extended duration of the journey is affecting me... both physically and mentally. I am alone. Something I always believed I preferred. I am alone. But I confess... it's wearing on me. I am alone. I am alone. Over and out. I've let so many people down. Hi, Roy. Um... I know it's a little bit weird... that I'm sending you this video, and not talking to you in person... I'm so selfish. I'm selfish. I'm just so selfish. I'm just a selfish person. And I know for certain I am doing God's work. Forgiveness is bullshit. We will find our brothers and sisters... Exaltation! Approaching location determined by McBride, Roy R.

Flight recorder, the Lima Project's orbit is degrading. Its position has shifted somewhat from the programmed coordinates. I will need to take a transport capsule to maneuver around Neptune's rings. The Cepheus will remain in autopilot while I complete the mission. All my life, I was terrified to confront him. I'm terrified even now. What do I expect? In the end, the son suffers the sins of the father. Warning. Power surge. CPU damaged. Warning. Power surge. Lima, Major McBride of the Cepheus. United States Armed Forces, Space Division. Attempting to contact Dr. Clifford McBride. Over. Lima, Cepheus. Do you read? Over. Craft damaged. Unable to dock. Roy? Roy, is that you? I have cataracts, I don't see very well. Hi, Dad. You alone? Oh, yeah. Captain always goes down with the ship. I've been here quite a while alone. I'm trying to stop this goddamn surge. What happened? My last loyal few tried to escape. And they started all this. They caused a meltdown out there, Roy. We fought, and our struggle caused catastrophe. It's why I'm here. I'm gonna stop it. Get the two of us back home, maybe. Home? Yep. This is home. This is a one-way voyage, my son. You're talking about Earth? There was never anything for me there. I never cared about you, or your mother... or any of your small ideas. For 30 years... I've been breathing this air, eating this food... enduring these hardships... and I never once thought about home. I know, Dad. I knew this would widow your mother... and orphan you... but I found my destiny. So, I abandoned my son. I still love you, Dad. I'm taking you back. Hmm... I have work to do. I have infinite work to do. I must find intelligent life. It's time to go. We don't have much time. Come on. I admire your courage for coming alone, Roy... traveling all this way... following me here. Makes me wonder what we could have accomplished together. But I guess... the fates have deprived me of the partner I should have had. If we'd had more people like you... we could have pressed on, could've found what we're looking for. My crew examined all the data... discovered no other life out there. No other consciousness. They quit. Sometimes... the human will must overcome the impossible. You and I have to continue on, Roy. Together. To find what science claims does not exist. You and I, together, Roy. Because the Lima Project has told us... that we're all alone in the knowable universe. I can't fail. You can't let me fail, Roy. Dad... you haven't. Now, we know... we're all we've got. Armed. T-minus three hours. Dad! Stop! Roy! Let me go. Let me go, Roy. Roy, let me go. Let me go, Roy. Dad! Let me go, Roy. Unhook me. Unhook me, son. Why go on? Why keep trying? You're gathering my work, I see. Data download initiated. We're a dying breed, Roy. He captured strange and distant worlds in greater detail than ever before. They were beautiful, magnificent... full of awe and wonder. But beneath their sublime surfaces... there was nothing. No love or hate. No light or dark. He could only see what was not there... and missed what was right in front of him. Command, this is Major Roy McBride. I made it to the Lima Project. I am destroying the structure... to prevent any further surges from reaching Earth... using the nuclear munitions onboard. I will attempt to return using the explosion as my primary propellant. In the case I do not survive, I've retrieved significant data from the Lima. And all efforts should be made to retrieve my craft. Trajectory, Earth. 2.714 billion miles. I am looking forward to the day my solitude ends. And I'm home. Detonation in T-minus 20 seconds. The aboard advisory system. Affirmative, we're ready. USP flight system is operational. Thank you. K-R-5 on the 4-2. Good copy, flight. We're ready to go. Coming in, clean. Copy that. Thanks. One ready to go. Data is good. We have all good. All good. You're all right, Major. I'm steady, calm. I slept well. No bad dreams. I am active and engaged. I'm aware of my surroundings and those in my immediate sphere. I'm attentive. I'm focused on the essential... to the exclusion of all else. I'm unsure of the future... but I'm not concerned. I will rely on those closest to me. And I will share their burdens... as they share mine. I will live... and love. Submit.
