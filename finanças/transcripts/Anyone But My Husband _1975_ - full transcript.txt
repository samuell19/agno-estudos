Slower, Bonnie. Slower. That's it. Yeah, yeah, keep doing it just like that. Just like that. Oh yeah, just like that. Oh, oh, I can't wait. I can't wait. I'm coming. I'm... oh, oh, hold on, hold on. Oh, oh, oh, oh, yes, keep doing it. Just like that, keep riding it like that. Keep riding it like that. Oh! That's good, that's good. - Okay. - Oh, oh, oh. Just like that. Oh, oh, that feels good. Oh, that feels good. Oh, no, no. Oh, how young you feel. Oh, yes, a nice little 15 year old. Oh! Oh! I haven't had one... oh, oh. Yeah. - Oh, oh. - Yeah. - Oh, oh. - Yeah. Oh, oh, yeah. Make it count. Now. Now let it go deep inside of you. Ah, how many years since I had a tight, young virgin pressing down on me? Yeah, you can feel all the thrusts. That's it. Oh... You feel like a virgin. That's right, keep going. Deep down, that's it. Keep pressing harder. Harder, keep pressing harder. Oh, let's go -- no. Make it loud. Make it -- - Oh, I can't breathe. Make it. Hello? Oh, it's you Sylvia. Look, I really can't talk. I've got a capon in the oven and Sam will be home in a minute. Better. What's that supposed to mean? He's at a teacher's conference. Keep up with my rhythm. There's no rush. Of course I believe him. Look, I really can't talk. That's a rotten thing to say. Now slowly, slowly, slowly up and down. Yeah. Want to feel that tight little cunt of yours. Oh, I'm gonna fill you up, you bitch. Oh, yes! Oh yes, around, that's it. In a circular motion, yeah, yeah. Around, around. Yeah! Yeah, just like that. Fuck me. Fuck me. Oh, Mr. Pelham! You don't stand a chance tonight, Sam. Ooh! Ah, ah! I'm gonna fill you up. You're gonna be full of my semen, you little, cunting bitch. You twat. Oh, oh, I can't wait. I can't wait, I can't wait. I can't wait! I'm coming, I'm coming! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Well, Sam, here's to our new beginning. Hey, you're too young to drink. Cut that out. You've gotta be kidding, Mr. Pelham. You know, I always wondered what it would be like to fuck my history teacher. Ah, don't kid me. I've seen you looking at all them tits and asses. And how come you're always hanging out at the gym, huh? Hey, look. That's quite enough out of you, young lady. Bonnie? Bonnie, are you home? What the hell are you doing in there with the door closed? Who the hell is that? That's my mother. Your what? My mother. Well, everybody's got one. Have you got a man in there? Oh, don't worry about it. She was at a friend's house. She just came home early. Fuck you, you little cunt. How am I going to get outta here? They usually go down the fire escape. Oh, help me, this is the last time. I'll fix you so you won't even be able to walk again, you little tramp. Wait 'til your father gets home. So... and down the fire escape again. Yeah, I'll fix this one. I'll see that he winds up behind bars. My own daughter... a whore. God, where have I gone wrong? Sam, I prepared all this for you. Come, let's have some champagne before dinner. Come on. Leave me alone, will you, Nora? Look, I had a rough day today at school and I'm in no mood to celebrate. I suppose you think it's easy teaching those little bastards, huh? Some soft life, a college degree I needed. Oh, please, Sam. It'll be just like it was on our honeymoon. Remember? I was too young to drink, so you had to bring a bottle of champagne up to the hotel room. Jesus, knock it off, will you? Oh, honey. Oh, come on, get outta here. Ugh, boy, I could sleep for seven days. Please have some champagne with me. Champagne? That's just beautiful. That's just beautiful. That's just what I need. I work like an idiot all day long, trying to teach history to homicidal morons, and you want me to drink champagne. Only I have a wife who buys caviar, champagne, anything else on a high school teacher's salary! What's the matter, Sam? Have I gotten too old for you? Yeah, too old in the wrong places. Caviar? What the hell do you think this is, anyway? The S.S. France? You know, your body may have gotten old. You're not the cute little high school cheerleader anymore, but your brain hasn't gotten past the third grade. Now will you turn off that damn record? Sure, sure, Sam'll pay for it. Sam'll pay for anything. The Pelham to the jet center to block. Oh, will you shut the fucking lights? Another thing -- This is really very embarrassing, Dr. Malcolm. I've never been to see a psychiatrist before. But Sylvia -- - Yes, that's right. Nothing to fear when you sit in here. Now, why do you think your husband won't touch you? Because I'm too old. You don't look very old. How old are you, Nora? You don't understand. I'm 22. We were married when I was 16, but my husband... well, he has this hangup. He likes young girls. Well, I can understand that. I like them myself. Now, as to your problems, say the first thing that comes into your mind. Oh, no, on second thought, that'll take too long. We have to deal with this problem directly. Dr. Malcolm, do you think I'm unattractive? Of course not. I find myself attracted to you quite easily, but you needn't worry. I can control my feelings. Now, you seem to think that this Is your fault. It isn't. I don't think it's Sam's fault, either. These things happen in marriages when the partners have been very close. What does that mean? It means what it means. Don't worry about meanings. That will only confuse the Issue. Just try to be subjective. Don't try to figure out your problems. Just solve them. Well, what should I do? There's only one thing for it. The answer is very simple. You must have an affair. This will prove that some men still find you attractive, and this will undoubtedly change the pattern of your life. You, a psychiatrist, advising me to cheat on my husband? He probably does the same thing. Anyway, you're paying me for my professional opinion. That is my professional opinion. Take it or leave it. I guess I'll have to take it, but how do I go about having an affair? Oh, Nora, I'm surprised at you. You know I can't advise you on that. It would be unethical. And then what did he say? He said he couldn't advise me on how to do it. How do you go about having an affair, Sylvia? Ugh. Don't you think it's about time you grew up, my dear? I bet you still don't know anything. Well, of course, how could you with that jellyfish of a husband you have? Sylvia! Oh, never mind. At any rate, we must first decide what kind of a man we wanna have an affair with. Let's see... an intellectual, a hard hat, truck driver? What do you mean, "we?" Look, sweetie, you don't think you're in this alone, do you? Darren makes love to me once a week. On Sundays, if I'm very lucky. He says that it's terribly gauche and recherché during the week. He says that his mind is too full of art and inspirations during the week. Yeah. I know what his mind is full of, all right. So we're both looking for affairs. Now what's it's going to be? The intellectual or Stanley Kowalski? Who's Stanley Kowalski? Please. Never mind. I think we'll start with the creative type. Darren went to an art gallery opening just the other day. The artiste, as they say, is simply divine. Sylvia, I just don't know. Oh, look, there he is. Now come on, let's go over and I'll introduce you. Sylvia, what would he want with us? Nora, don't be such an arse. How do you do? My name is Nigel Farthington. How very charming of you to come to my gallery. Charming, mmm. Well, I've told you my name. You must tell me yours. Oh, I'm so delighted to meet you, Mr. Farthington. I'm Sylvia, darling. Just charming. And this is Nora Pelham. Mmm. Charming. I can only hope that you will be mildly amused by my modest attempts. You show very good taste in coming to my gallery. The most important thing in life is chic, and of course, a discerning eye. How very delighted I am to meet you, Mr. Farthington. And now, my darlings, I shall take you and show you everything. This is all breathtaking. I don't know very much about all this, but I'm sure you're a very great artist. Yes, I can just see the greatness all over the place. My dear Nora, every moment I live, I'm creating. Everything to me is art. I shall now take you and transform you into my own creation, and then you will see my true genius. You two darlings run along and create. Aunt Sylvia is late for her dog show and she expects to win the first prize. Ta-ta. Your friend is a little too cynical for my tastes. But you? You're charming. Now come with me. I'm terribly sorry. The gallery is closed for today. Thank you for coming. Good afternoon. Now, Nora, let us go over there and we will create. We're wasting time. Remove your clothes. Well, can't you paint me with my clothes on? You're joking, surely. You Americans. To think that I would be so pedestrian as to use canvas. No, this masterpiece will be a moment in time. Now remove your clothes. Stop it, you must be mad. I'll scream, really. You must be crazy! You can scream all you like. You'll not be heard, for this room is soundproof. Yes, it caters to my eccentricities. Scream, twist and turn. Help create my new masterpiece. Scream! Keep bleeding, Nora! Struggle! Struggle! You are my work of art. Your fear is my greatest creation. Stop, please! Nora, please! Please, I won't tell anybody. Let me go! Fight! How 'bout some more? Yes. That's it, Nora. More. Now keep fighting me. It isn't any good unless... That's it. Just see your stomach rising with mournful turns. That's it. Come on. Scream! Louder! That's it. Scream, Nora, as your sweet flesh Is caressed by my artistry. Keep bleeding, Nora. Struggle! Moans of ecstasy, of greatness, know the ultimate pleasure of pain. That was rather charming, Nora. You have just the right amount of fear and passion. I have given birth to a great new work. How pleased you must be to know that. Why don't you come back tomorrow afternoon, around 3:00? I shall need the same sort of inspiration again. Nora? Nora? Nora? Nora? You know, you look different somehow. How? Oh, I don't know. Never mind. When are you leaving? Tonight. I'll be back in about a week after the teachers' convention. Will you miss me? Mmm. I was thinking, maybe you should go to your mother's. Hmm. Well, the least you could do is say that you'll miss me. Maybe even ask me what hotel I'm staying at? I'll miss you, but must I know what hotel you'll be staying at? Never mind. That's the thanks I get for making a living and change that goddamn wall back to a normal color. This whole place looks like a bubble gum factory. It's shit. I waited until Sam left. Now I want you to tell me everything. You sure know some crazy people, Sylvia. Come on in. Well, did it happen? Did you have an affair? Well, it was fun until he started whipping me. He whipped you? Oh, that's marvelous. That's even better than I dared hope for. How was it? Did you like it? Did he hurt you? Was it fabulous? Did he make love to you? Are you nuts? I was terrified. Well, actually, it was little exciting. Oh, really? Were you really turned on? I mean, really turned on? Are you going back? You must be out of your mind. I want to go to bed, not to the hospital. That man should be locked up. I don't think I wanna meet any more of your friends, Sylvia. Well, I mean, Nora, what are you going to do now? Sam is leaving. He won't be back until next week, so I'll have plenty of time to experiment. I think I'll try something a little less violent. "For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings, but then I scorn to change my state with kings." Oh, Nora, my love, we are the children of our spirits, the souls of spring to come. We must consummate the rites of spring and let our bodies and souls rise together in a communion to the gods. Is all this really necessary? This? Why, this is my shrine to all the gods of poetry: Keats, Shelley, Wordsworth, Tennyson. Oh, Lord Byron, Longfellow. Frost. I must speak, Nora. The words are burning in my mouth, or maybe it's this chicken. Nora, we were meant to be together for all eternity. Can't you see? What are you talking about? It's our destiny. The fates have thrown us together. You must marry me, Nora. You must marry me today. Today, Nora. Please. Or I will not be responsible for my own life. I should've known you were off the wall when you asked me to dress this way. And this set, it's like a reject from South Pacific. You cannot deny what is ours. Come, Nora, we will marry this afternoon. Hmm? Oh, fuck off. Aren't there any sane men left in this world who just want a good lay? Nora, Nora, you will marry me? It is inevitable. We will be married this afternoon. Nora, marry me. Marry me! You know, I'm beginning to think the only sane and uncomplicated man left in this world is Sam. Oh, for heaven's sake, Nora. Don't be like that. Just because you ran into a couple of freaks doesn't mean you're going to give up, does it? I don't know. I've begun to realize just how much I love Sam. Ugh. Don't worry. I'm not gonna give up. That's the spirit. Onto the hordes! Nora, have you ever had your fortune told? No, of course not. Well, it just so happens that I have a friend who has given me the address of a very special fortune teller. Wait a minute. Not another friend of yours. Oh, but I'll be there. So it'll be just fine. Don't worry about a thing. Oh, well, what have I got to lose except my life? I see a man. I see a man entering your life. I see a man who is more than a man. I see two men. No...| see a man who is 13 feet high. No, no, no. He's not high, he's long. Yes, that is it. A man who is 13 inches long. Impossible. He's 13 inches long. Oh! Good heavens. And he's called... he is called... El Goncho, yes. El Goncho. Now what does that mean? I don't know, it's cloudy. I can't see. Oh, come on. Bring him back, come on. Yes, yes, it is getting clearer now, I see. It means, "the schnook." No, no, no, no, no, that cannot be. I look again. It means... it means, "the hook." Yes, he is called The Hook, and the crystal tells me that he's here now. He was here and he is looking for Sylvia. Oh, really? Oh, but that's impossible. I haven't seen anybody here, have you? Not since you've come in. But the crystal never lies. He is here now and the crystal gives me... Can you imagine? Isn't that the most absurd thing you ever heard? Is that thing for real? Madame Chaney is never fake. Everything in her house is real. Here, pull on it. You'll see. The voice speaks normally, but his cock, this is international. He seems to have taken a fancy to Sylvia. Very well, that's fine. The crystal ball never lies. You may take him up to room 8. The door is open. Well, what the hell? I can only live once, right? I see two women. I see you and me. Now wait a minute. No, no, no, there's nothing you can do. It's written in the stars. Come, come, darling. Take off your clothes and we'll see what we have here. But I've never been with a woman before. I mean... Come, I will clean you out first, and then we will see how well you make love. I haven't had a good piece in over a week. Oh, boy. Nora, my sweet, this boy must have his fun. Open your mouth. Oh, God. He must've had an operation. Oh my God. My throat will never be the same. It should only happen to Linda Lovelace. I'm beginning to think I should've never strayed. And now that Sam is in Chicago and can't even defend himself, I'm having these terrible feelings of guilt about these affairs, but I'm addicted. I can't give it up. I never felt so alive in years. This feeling of being alive is good, Nora. Now you begin to understand some of your problems. Your father was the key figure and your Oedipal problems all stem from him. This hysterical laryngitis IS a manifestation of that very symptom. Now, Sam was a substitute father that you never had, and your incestuous feelings towards Sam made you tired and unresponsive. So you see, the ramifications of what you have -- I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Hysterical laryngitis, shit! If you had just given head to 131/2 inches, you'd be a little hoarse, too. I am merely saying that now that you're cured, go back to your husband and resume the marriage that every young girl dreams about, and then -- What garbage! You don't hear a word I'm saying. You're nothing but a textbook. Forget it, Doc. You're a pile of bullshit. And as you see, your Oedipal motivations are easily within the grasp of your own mind, no matter how subconscious your fears might be, or even were. For that matter, you might as well forget the whole thing. ♪ Early in the morning ♪ - Surprise! - Hey! Whoo! Hey. Turn on the light here so you can see. Hey, this is really nice. Wow. You like it?

Let's have some wine to celebrate my first night home. Please, Sam, some other time. I'm much too tired. Yes, but I've been neglecting you, and I wanna change all that. Not right now. Anyway, you forgot the caviar. Boy, am I beat. I could sleep for seven days. Yeah, but I thought... What did you think? Do you think you had a rough day? Well, I have it tough. Washing and cleaning and then trying to look beautiful. I've never been so worn out. Sure, Nora will be there, her body waiting for her lord and master. Sure, buy wine, buy wine. But nobody even asked me if I want wine. And Sam, turn off the damn light.
