CROWD CHEERS MAN ON RADIO: This is XS Manchester. It gives me great pleasure to welcome a man who, uh... sung on some of the most era-defining records not just in the 903 but of a// time, in my opinion. And it is Liam Gallagher. Nice to see you again, fella. How are ya? — LIAM: l’m good, man, feeling good. Thirty years, can you believe that? — LIAM: No, lcan’t, mate. LIAM: Still buzzing, man, still on that crusade just to not get suckered in by the dickheads. CROWD CHEERS LIAM (VO): /’m not doing this to be more famous. l’m fucking famous enough, you know what / mean? And /’m not doing it for the money. / joined the band because / love music. / know how fucking great / am and / know how shit / am, you know what / mean? l’m proud of fucking staying alive, man. Being here, man. Not becoming a fucking casualty. MUFFLED CHEERS Not letting the bastards get you down, man or the people who’ve written you off who were sitting there for the last ten years going ”0h, he ’s fucking gonna be dead now. He ’s definite/y gonna blow his brains out. He ’s gonna have a drug overdose... ” They’ve got all them press headlines waiting but... / don ’t think it’s gonna happen, lads you know what / mean? / think l’m gonna stick it out. CROWD SCREAMS CAMERAS CLICK SCREAMING CONTINUES M AN : They were disgusting. They abused passengers, they abused the hostess staff... / think the road/es behaved quite well, but... the band members were absolutely abysmal. WOMAN: There were some passengers that complained about your behaviour. is tha t—— — Yeah. PAUL ARTHURS: Didn’t know what to expect, d’you know what / mean? / didn’t expect to go to Japan from the first year or go round America or get a Number One album. LIAM: When you ’re starting out, you’ve gotta do the whole circuit but as you ’re getting a bit bigger, you can pick and choose. / think it ’s better off 6, 000 people do two nights, it’s just the way. All the fame and that, some of it’s boring. Some of it does your head in, some of it’s not real. / fucking hate the fucking sight of yous. So we’ve never been here before. But you like it. / like it, anyway. And l’m having a great time. / ’ve enjoyed myself. The same other things get in the way but, you know. There you go. — MAN: lt’s sl/pping now. is it? Ta-ral CROWD BOOS MAN, OVER MICROPHONE: Unfortunate/y, Liam and Noel Gallagher have just had a huge big fight together in the dressing room. The band is not going to play tonight and cancelled the rest of the Euro tour. CROWD BOOS You can go and check on their website and you will have the full story from Noel. CROWD CHANT: Encu/é, encu/é, encu/él PAUL (VO): / kinda knew something was happening. There was something not right. Travelling on separate buses, and... separate dressing rooms, and separate this and separate that. LIAM: Maybe the albums weren’t doing as well as they... But obviously, we were ob viously on the slide d’you know what / mean? Which is... which happens to every band, that’s all. Ob viously then there was little bits of arguments and stuff about where the band was going. PAUL: Shut up! if you think rock and roll is getting arrested and all that-- LIAM: Rock and roll is about being yourself and/ won ’t... BONEHEAD (VO): lt might’ve been on the tour bus it might’ve been on the stage, backstage... / could never stand back and watch... those two fight, or get at each other, you know. Sometimes it was pretty vicious and pretty nasty. NOEL: Rock and roll ’s about music! Music! LIAM: Yeah, lknow it is. — NOEL: Shut the BLEEP up, man. LIAM (VO): When we was on this train to Paris Noel was just sat down the back on the fucking phone to Gordon Smart out of The Sun telling him what goes down and what we’ve been up to. ”Oh yeah, Liam ’s like... ” Just spilling the beans on the band. It was like you're working for the fucking Sun. So we get there, and I've had a word with him about summat and he's had a word with me about summat and he's fucking jumped on my guitar, smashed it up, which was a present which means nothing to a lot of people but it meant a lot to me. So then I fucking got one of his guitars... I think | smashed his up and that was it. MAN ON MICROPHONE: Je suis tres déso/é. Mais Oasis ne marche pas. CROWD GASPS I was there, it was kind of a bit silly, to be fair. I mean, I've seen worse fights. LIAM: Noel scooted off in his Ferrari with his bodyguard. He had his little statement already wrote... you know, and that was it. And then that was the band over, you know what I mean? Noel Gallagher has announced he is quitting the band Oasis. He says he can no longer work with his brother Liam after a series of rows. Last night, the band cancelled a performance in Paris. LIAM: It was like, I'm still in shock, you know what I mean? It was like, what the fuck? Woah! It was like, what the fuck's going on here? You know what I mean? I couldn't see anything past that, you know what I mean? I couldn't see a career in... or doing... you know, fuckin' rally driver or playing table tennis or fucking being a chef. It was like, it was Oasis till the day I die, you know I mean? PAUL: Once Noel had decided he was gonna go his way... erm, yeah, it got difficult. When you're in a band with your brother for 20-odd years... and then he... for Whatever reason decides he doesn't want to be in a band with you anymore it's very public and it plays out in front of the world's media. Yeah, and I think that hurt him a bit. LIAM: When that happened, the rug was pulled. There was always gonna be a sense of... "jackpot my dreams", you know what I mean? It's all a bit like... I'm taking my ball home and fuck the lot of yous you know what I mean? And that's not what happens. I don't think you do that with family you know what I mean? I haven't got his number to call him cos he's too scared to give it me mam. INTERVIEWER: And have you ever even bumped into him? No, not bumped into him. The geezer wears many masks, man. You know what I mean? He probably walks past me every day. But, erm, no, I haven't bumped into him. And I don't know what I'd do, you know what I mean? Whether I'd chase him down the road and fucking... with the pickaxe, who knows? Or maybe I'd fucking jump on him and give him a love bite who knows what... I don't know where I'd be at, you know what I mean? Cos I'm angry still, you know what I mean? He split me band up. MUSIC: "Soul Love" by Beady Eye LIAM (VO): I certainly wasn't gonna go home and fucking hide under the pillows and I wasn't ashamed of anything, you know what I mean? Cos it wasn't my doing so we went back to the hotel, had a couple of drinks scratched our heads and went "Look..." "What d'you want to do?" # Get up off your knees my friend. # BONEHEAD (VO): When Noel left, Liam could not have said, "Right that's it. It's over and I'm not doing it." He had to keep going, you know, cos that's what he does. They just sat down and said "What we gonna do? We've gotta carry on, we'll change the name - Beady Eye." # Soul love, soul love. # INTERVIEWER: If Beady Eye was a car... — LIAM: If Beady Eye was a car it'd be a fuckin Rolls Royce Phantom, big, beautiful, brash. You know it's fuckin' coming. You know it's there when it fucking runs you over. INTERVIEWER: Is it gonna run us over? — LIAM: What, Beady Eye? LIAM: Without a fucking doubt mate, I wouldn't be doing it otherwise, would I? ROCK MUSIC PLAYS I went out and saw Beady Eye live. I thought they were amazing. I thought it was a really, you know, the band was great, obviously. # Sleep walk away your life if that turns you on # LIAM (VO): We were still buzzing, you know what I mean? We still had something to do, you know what I mean? # .../ook away and it’s gone. # I like that, the lemons, that's good innit? I want one of them fences. We still had, like, an itinerary, you know what I mean? We went on tour. We were in the studio. We were doing videos. I fucking cannot wait to get on that stage and fucking have it. I thought the gigs were good so we didn't have any time to sort of reflect on the big Oasis break-up. LIAM: I'm enjoying it a bit more, you know what I mean? We just go on there for 50 minutes and just fuckin kick out the jam, man. And leave it up to someone else to do the big fucking entertaining tonight you what I mean? 80... It'd be good, but headlining? Fucking done with it. Been there, done that. CROWD CHEERS — Liam! Liam! That was shit! That's the complex world of him, he, he just thinks it was average. BONEHEAD: I thought the music was great. The music was certainly strong enough and you had Liam Gallagher fronting the band. BRIAN MAY: You're looking well. I'm not knocking about with my brother too much, you know what I mean? Is that good for you then? — Took years off me. BONEHEAD: You'd have thought with that Oasis hardcore fan base that Beady Eye would have just been, like, phew, straight up and... carried on where Oasis sort of fell over, but it didn't. MIKE SMITH (VO): They hadn't stopped, they hadn't had a break. He'd gone straight from Oasis into Beady Eye done the first album, straight out on the road and it was just like, he was charging forward and I don't think he'd ever given himself a moment to acknowledge that Oasis was no more. He never had a chance to grieve for that. BONEHEAD: See, Beady Eye surprised me, it's like why aren't Beady Eye playing bigger fucking venues than they're playing? Was that just... the record company being shite and the management being shite? I don't know. Cos I think they deserved better. We're used to seeing you guys in stadiums. Yeah. — This is rather more intimate, isn't it? I know it's a shame, innit? — Why is it a shame? SHE GIGGLES I don't know, nah, I'm joking. Nah, it is intimate. But this is the way the world is today. TED KESSLER: Beady Eye, suddenly, he doesn't have Noel Gallagher writing the songs for him, I think he suddenly found out that just being Liam... it wasn't enough. PAUL: I could tell he was upset because then Noel started his career... and was slating Liam every day and that's not a brotherly thing to do, anyway. NOEL: I'd been in the middle of the stage and singing, and... it was gone, it was over in a flash and I don't know how it was. INTERVIEWER: And you did like half of Oasis songs and half of your songs which went down pretty well with everyone. No, I did all of my songs. SHE LAUGHS AWKWARDLY LIAM: I don't drive cars and I don't fly planes so the money I spend, and the money I've ever earnt has always been on clothes, and... school fees and alcohol and probably drugs and the odd house. CAMERAS CLICK LIAM: Beady Eye is a great band and it's gonna get better. INTERVIEWER: Still the same people in the band as... LIAM: Yes, oh yes! Noel's not joined yet. THEY LAUGH LIAM: Fashion is where it's at, apparently. I'm doing this not to make money. I'm doing this... just to do something, you know what I mean? And if people like it, then they like it. If they don't... No skin off my nose. I'm thinking Pretty Green, man. And all them cunts who fucking slag it off they're just fucking jealous. Cheers. WOMAN: People, they're taking you serious, actually. Are they? — Yeah. Well, that'll be a first. It's not about being big anymore, I don't give a shit anymore. You know what I mean? It's like, I'll play here, man. CAMERA CLICKS "Who are you?" "I don't know, I don't know" No, but I love that, though, when they go "who are ya?" Fuck knows. HE CHUCKLES Fuck knows. Fuck knows who I am anymore. MIKE: He'd gone in, made the second Beady Eye record which I thought was a really strong record, but... through of bunch of... you know, unfortunate circumstances the band had pretty much fallen apart literally as they were about to promote it so the record didn't have a chance. LIAM (VO): I just thought, "You know what, people don't want it for some reason it's not connecting". I just think maybe the name or maybe it was too soon after Oasis, so... And obviously there was a lot of stuff going on in my personal life. I thought, well, this kinda... this ain't good, d'ya know what I mean? Andy Bell had rang us up saying he wanted to get back with Ryan. I was thinking, you know what, I'm not being in a band with someone who's gonna be hop skipping from two bands, you know what I mean? And, you know, that's his right, he can do what he wants but I was thinking "Go on, you go and do the ride. I'm out of it", you know what I mean? I'm fucking, I'm gonna go and get me shit sorted out and I thought, you know what... I think I need to fucking just take a break, you know what I mean, from music. PAUL: It's hard for him to accept that. I think that was the first time in his life that he's... It didn't work. LIAM: So that was like "fucking hell", this is the first time in twenty years or whatever that I'm without a band. I was going, "fuck it, what am I gonna do now, man?" No band, no songs, no niche. Something dodgy could be around the corner, you know what I mean? And you gotta just fasten your seatbelt a little bit and just ride the wave, you know what I mean? And see where it takes ya. REPORTER: Nico/e has split with former Oasis front man, Liam Gallagher. He was very down and fed up with himself. He definitely was, yeah. PAUL (V0): The divorce isn't in private, it's very public and it plays out in front of the world's media. That hurt him a bit. LIAM (VO): Lawyers morning, noon and night, you know what I mean? In and out of court. Sorta mopping up the milk that I've spilt. PEGGY: The media had given him an awful time. JOURNALIST: Have you see you daughter yet, Liam? PEGGY: They never wrote anything good about him. PAUL: Noel, in the press, in conjunction put the boot into him and the music press had written him off and with all the troubles in his private life he was pretty much at the bottom. Alright, cocker! On the bus, the magic bus on the way to Brussels. LIAM: Sometimes when you're in a band you're in a bit of bubble, aren't ya, you know what I mean? With the real life sort of going on around you but you're not kind of connected to it. And this time, the bubble had been burst... and it was like I'd landed into fucking reality and the reality was not that good, d'you know what I mean? I just wanted to fucking hide in the corner, and... make sure the kids were alright, and... try and make sense of whatever was going on. There was one particular night where I was just on Twitter and I could just see these tweets from Liam, 5O tweets in one night rambling at the world, but they were just pretty... angry, and sad, and lost so I texted him "Are you alright?" "Am I fuck alright", he was like, "fucking, fucking" this. And I was just like, "Do yourself a favour, man. Just put your phone down and stop tweeting cos it ain't nice to see. You're giving the fucking world ammunition to dig at you, man". It was awful, man. That wasn't the Liam I know. It was almost a cry for help, you know what I mean? PAUL: He texted me in the morning like 7am and just thought, you're drunk, go to bed. I haven't heard from him for six hours. The phone goes. "Where are ya? Come to my house now, oh, and bring a bottle of Jack Daniels". So I get to his house and he's like "I need a private jet" and I'm like, "You what?" He goes, "Yeah, me and you. We're going somewhere". BONEHEAD: I texted Liam, "You alright, mate?" He says "Yeah, Paul's getting us a plane and we're getting the fuck out of here". I said, "Where you gonna go?" He goes, "I dunno. I'll see how much fucking petrol the pilot's got, shall we?" HE CHUCKLES Right so, I've got my iPad in one hand, got Jack Daniels in the other going... going to the agent, and says "Right", da-da-da-da... She says "Right, I've got you an aircraft leaving Luton at 10 o'clock tonight". You're going to Palma. NOEL: Circumstances have led me to being in one of the biggest and greatest bands ever and when I left that, it's like, well, I'm not gonna do another band. That'd be ludicrous... as most of Oasis found out when they started Beady Eye. INTERVIEWER: D'you think that was always doomed from the beginning? NOEL: Yeah, of course it was. PAUL: We've landed in Palma at midnight, going... "Uh—oh. Right. Everything's black. Where we going?" I've got an overnight bag thinking I'm going to his house in London and then we've called Bonehead, he's arrived the next day, and, yeah. BONEHEAD (VO): When lgot out there, there was the initial, like... ”What the fuck ’3 gone on?” Y’know what / mean? And it was Liam ’s life at that moment, you know, it was shit. Day one, off me coconut. BONEHEAD: He looked fucked. Like, really fucking tired, going through the fucking divorce. The press were on his fucking case. People accusing him of that. People taking him, money here, band's fell apart he's got no fucking music. He was fucking lost, d'you know what I mean? Day two, and off me fucking coconut. BONEHEAD: Yeah, I think he was fucking terrified truth be told, that that was the end of his career in music. Day three... still off me coconut. The three of us always, when we're together, we sort it all out. I mean, he needs his blow out which is what it was. But then... You know, you've had your week away with your mates you gotta go and face the music. It's like Sesame Street. Innit, like Sesame Street. CHUCKLING LIAM: Debbie was the one. She was my inspiration, she was the one that was like "Look... come on, fucking, you've not killed anyone. Come on, let's get back into the music, snap out of it," you know what I mean? # Got the whole world in our hands # # Come and take a chance and start anew. # DEBBIE: I've always been aware of Oasis and of Liam but... I was never particularly an Oasis fan, as such. I kind of never really paid much attention to it. Even now, sometimes I feel guilty when Liam's talking to me about songs that he's thinking about performing I have to google them and see which ones they are, but... I'm learning. PAPARAZZI SHOUT — # Got the whole world in our hands. # BONEHEAD (VO): Thank God for Debbie, you know, what a person. For Liam, you know, them two together. But/ think Debbie convinced Liam that... he had to get off his arse and actually get up and pick your guitar up start writing, and Liam can write some fucking songs. DEBBIE: As much as Liam said at the time he just wanted to move abroad find somewhere, live a quiet life. I knew that if he did that, that would just be temporary anyway because I knew that he would never be happy unless he was back singing and performing. Whenever he was off guard he would pick up a guitar or he'd be singing. He just starts playing a few chords and then sees what comes out and then works on it from there records it on his phone and then most people get to hear it when he's had a drink, basically. PAUL: We were in Ireland and... everything in Ireland revolves around a pub. LIAM: When you're driving through the town, it's like... HE SIGHS Look at that lovely pub. You'd go "Oh, mam. I'll just be there in a... I'm just having a Guinness." D'you know what I mean? And you know what it's like. There's no such thing as just having one. PAUL: You know, we'd been out all day for about, oh, something like eight hours. Eight hours is a long time drinking Guinness. And you can tell which way it's gonna go. LIAM: So before you know it, you're about 30 Guinness' in. D'you know what I mean? And then someone gets the guitar out and before you know it you're fucking thinking you can play it. GUITAR PLAYS JJ FINAN: When he played... and everybody stood still, everything stopped and everybody started taking things, you know taking photographs with their mobile phone and stuff like that. # When / wake up and / hear you say # # There ’s no love worth chasing yesterday # # Cos it’s alright, it’s alright now. # Someone gives him a guitar and the rest is history. Yeah, he sings his song "Bold", and... And then it went... Someone recorded it, and it went around the world. # / didn’t do what/ was told # # Yes / know you saw soul. # I know enough about music to know that was a hit. # / didn’t do what/ was told. # BONEHEAD: He was sending me finished songs, just on his phone, y'know just recorded on his phone in his kitchen, and one of them was "Bold". It wasn't like... "Fucking get your ears round this one, man, it's gonna blow your fucking head off. Come on!" It was none of that attitude. It was a bit more humble, like... "So what do you think? D'you think it's alright?" He's like "D'you think it's alright?" I said "It's fucking massive mate, yeah." LIAM: And then I played it Debbie and she thought it were good and that and she thought, "Let's go and speak to someone at a record label". PHIL CHRISTIE: I heard the music and thought it was better than anything he'd done for ten or 15 years. And there was this drive and this hunger and this will to win and to prove people wrong that I really fed off. That was what made the deal a very easy decision. MIKE: And that certainly drew a lot of raised eyebrows cos you're signing Liam Gallagher, he doesn't write songs. LIAM: I'm not a songwriter. I come into this world as a singer, you know what I mean? But I do write the odd songs but anyway, I'm not... I'm... alright, I'm a songwriter that hasn't got a lot of songs HE CHUCKLES I'll give you that. # it’s not goodbye. # PAUL: No, he's not a prolific songwriter. He has one or two, or three. But you can't make a record with three songs. You need a minimum ten for an album. # l’ve all / need and more. # PAUL: So you can write "Bold". He knew he had to get more. And to do that you have to go and work with other people which is never even done before. BONEHEAD: Trying to bounce back and embark on this solo career with the weight of all his fucking personal things his divorce and whatever and shite he was going through that just totally fucking shows his strength of character. DAN: I guess Liam's got a reputation. From day one, I realised that he wasn't that character when you're with him on his own. He's a much more honest and open and real person. MIKE: He didn't look like a man defeated. But at the same time, that really confident character wasn't necessarily there. He certainly didn't appreciate how good he was at that particular point. GUITAR PLAYS # You can make or break my day # # They’re only words / hear you say # # / give you something you can shout about # # / won ’t ever let you down... # MUSIC FADES Yeah. I really like that, I really like that. So, um, I reckon we should do the next verse. RECORDED MUSIC PLAYS MUSIC FADES OUT Maybe on every beat, no, or would it be too much? # l’ve all... # #lneed... # # ...and more. # That was good there, man. Like that. — HE IMITATES GUITAR NOTES GUITAR PLAYS NOTES — Yeah, that's good. GUITARIST: The one note? — Yeah. LIAM: Yeah, cool. When I went in to do the demos it was like... I was in there playing a guitar and was I thinking "How the fuck though, is he gonna be able to get it?" You know what I mean? Cos I don't, it's all a bit odd, innit? And he picked it up straight away, I was like that. Fucking cool. MUSIC PLAYS — It needs some like... HE IMITATES NOTES Tell you what would be great there - a bass drum there, after that. MUSIC PLAYS I like that! That little jangly guitar. # it’s not goodbye # # So dry your eyes # # Come rain or shine # # l’ve all / need... # # ...and more. # Yeah, it's fucking buzzing that tune. It's got a good vibe, hasn't it? CAMERAMAN: It was nice seeing you in control of it all and not... Yeah. You gotta put your bits out, haven't you, man? And if they fucking work, they work, you know what I mean? Not everything's gonna work, man. Yeah. Exactly. You've gotta just say it how you see it, haven't you? How you heard it. You know what I mean, and then go... Cos I play that rhythm sometimes in me house and I go well that's fucking... if you don't fucking say it If it works, it fucking works. PEGGY: He definitely got happier as he went in the studio and started recording again. I think that really brought him out of himself. # Here comes my epiphany # # Been sitting all so patient/y. # PEGGY: Liam is Liam, you get whatever you see with Liam. That's what you get, he's still the very same. Yeah, he'll straight come back home and he'll still... shout and bawl when he wants to and put the kettle on. LIAM: Tripping in here one night watching The Mondays about five of us. Me mum wasn't having it. DEBBIE: Yeah, they'll be fine in here. When they see him next anyway. This is Margaret Gallagher. Say hello to the camera. — Hello, camera. Debbie Gwyther. Gene Gallagher. CAMERAMAN: Do you come back here often? Uh, not as much as I should do, but... Not as much as I should do. When me mam left me dad, she got all of this sorted and we snuck off in the middle of the night and then, this was our new house. It wasn't like this. She's got it well nice now. HE CLEARS HIS THROAT We used to just to sit there on a blanket fucking stoned while me mam was at work with the speakers facing out of the window with all the music we'd just bought or the tunes we'd just bought from Sifters and that and I'd sit there, me and Johnno, Coats here, just fucking listening to Jimi Hendrix and The Beatles and just... Iaze about. I remember coming back here after the first night at Maine Road and getting me head down thinking "Fucking hell, what was all that about?" Then the second night then we moved out and then I fucked off down to London. MARGARET: Do you remember the time you sat out in the kitchen and told me you wanted to be a singer? Yeah. —SHELAUGHS And I says to him "To being a singer?" I says, "You can't sing." "Oh, I can," he says, "Mam" he says, "I'm going to be famous". "Oh", I said, "You want to bloody hurry up and be famous then." SHE LAUGHS Yeah what about Paul though? He was gonna be on Strictly Come Dancing. — No, you're taking the piss. LIAM: No, but you must've thought we were all on magic mushrooms. You got this dickhead here who thinks he a singer you've got this one here who thinks he's Wayne Sleep... D'you know what I mean? Lionell fucking Blair. What did Noel want to be? Paul is... He wanted to be a fireman. HE SCOFFS Fucking "fireman". MARGARET: They were here then all of a sudden they were all gone. LIAM: They were on the box. — And it was huge. Yeah, they were on the TV. No, I found that hard to deal with actually. — Did ya? I did, yeah. Then you wouldn't see you for months because you were touring. I found that difficult. CAMERAMAN: You must be proud of them all. Oh, very proud, yeah. Yeah. I still get me tissues out. SHE CHUCKLES Every time they're on the television, I'm still there with a box of tissues. Liam always likes to come home. Yeah, it's nice, I should come back more often, but... You should do, as like I tell yous there's no use in coming back when I'm not here. Exactly. — Mm. Exactly. CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS LIAM: I was never gonna sit there and do it on my own on a guitar even though a lot of people thought I was - which I wasn't - cos I'm not into that. By the time we got to Abbey Road, we had the whole band. And I like the vibe, I like the mentality of being in a band and being around people and that. Four heads are better than one, you know what I mean? DREW: When we went in to Abbey Road to record "I Get By" we'd been playing together in the studio for a number of weeks. That's it, that's it, whack down. DREW: The chemistry is something that you can't anticipate with people that you've never met before. But we lucked out with this band. CHRISTIAN: It must be a different dynamic for him to be in a band full of people that get on with him and just do what he wants, you know and just sort of provide a stable backing for him. Sounds really good, no? How are you guys? Beefy guys. — Lush, yeah. Fucking beefy. DAN: It just worked, I don't know how, just all the cogs fell into place and we just got on with it. DREW: Those horn lines, those base riffs all those nuances they were all from his ear. DAN: He's got all these ideas and all these sounds and all these parts flying around in his head. He'd sing a melody once you put that melody into a song it's always a genius idea. LIAM: I've always loved being in a studio just being around it and watching it all come to life, you know what I mean from the first bass drum to the first strum on the guitar and you watch the record go in different directions you know what I mean? Some days it turns out how you want to in your head and some days it doesn't, you know what I mean? Some days it turns out better. MIKE: It was Liam wholly owning the recording. He knew the record he wanted to make and it was great to see him actually in there and being totally in charge of the situation and I don't imagine that was something he'd ever had an opportunity to do before. Sweet. LIAM: I need to calm down, you know what I mean? Fucking blown me voice in the first fucking... VOICE BREAKS: "Good evening!" MEN LAUGH — D'you know what I mean... Do it like fucking Axl Rose, you know what I mean? Fucking, got a fucking gig today, man. "I GET BY" PLAYS # So out me some slack # # / wanna see all of you # # / never hold back from the truth # # Unlike you # # Unlike you. # Stop that. — Yeah! I'll have it. I'd buy it. You what? — I'd buy that. I don't remember you doing that harmony. — I'd definitely download it. Vocal harmony. I'd definitely download that. LIAM: I tell you what, it's been fucking amazing, man. It's been fucking mega, man. Top work, man. Nice one. — Nice one. Take care. See you later. See yous in a bit. PAUL: Nobody's heard the record yet. Promoters don't tend to gamble too much so... the Ritz, 2,000 capacity is a safe starting ground. REPORTER: Well, we’ve got some news coming in to us out of the North West, Greater Manchester Police have warned people to stay away from Manchester Arena. Amid reports on social media of some kind of explosion. MUFFLED SCREAMS REPORTER 2: With 22 dead and dozens injured hundreds came out into Central Manchester today to remember lives lost. Fellas, just step to the side for us, please. We haven't got time to stop. We haven't got time to stop, I'm sorry. Cheers man. FAN: Any chance you can let us in, Liam? It's ramo, mate. FAN: Yes, Liam! — Liam! Get him back! Can I have a photo? Stay there. — Liam, please, I fucking love you, lad! Aw, quick photo! Guys, stay back. Liam! — Liam. Yes! Liam! LIAM: It's horrific, right, man? Horrific. BONEHEAD: It was, but hopefully, you know... put that aside and we'll get 'em bouncing tonight, forget about that and we'll get their mind off that, it was horrible man, horrible. I guess a little bit nervous... but nah, I can't wait to just get on there, man and fucking... carry on this crusade of no fucking giving up, man and these evil cunts, and just fucking get back on, carry on with it. You know what I mean? — HE CLAPS LIAM: It's always hard work going back to your own town, doing your gig new album but with the stuff that had gone down, it was super heavy you know what I mean, we just wanted to show respect. We've gotta put on a good gig for them, you know what I mean as much as you can. INTRO TO l'I GET BY" PLAYS CROWD ROARS CROWD CHANTS: Liam! Liam! Liam! / am he, cos you are he cos you are he and we are all together. # l’ve all / need... # # ...and more. # BONEHEAD: I was watching it from up on the balcony and the atmosphere and that venue was unlike any Oasis gig I'd ever seen. The feeling. The expectation. # There ’s no time for looking back. # It was a crowd reaction. It was like "Wow", you know, that was fucking, pretty intense. It was as if they wanted him more than ever. # Slow down, all things must pass # # Take your time # # Know the score # # Tomorrow... # MIKE: That show was an incredible coming together a connection between Liam and his audience. # The winds of change... # # ...must blow. # CROWD CHANTS: Liam! Liam! Liam! Manchester, llove you, we love ya. Look after each other. Thank you for coming out! CROWD CHANTS # it’s not goodbye # # So dry your eyes. # MIKE: It was a hugely emotional moment. I think he completely united a community. LIAM: I'm proud that we did it, you know what I mean? Music, man, is power, you know what I mean? It brings people together, it can just... make you feel like everything's gonna be alright. I'm most of a shit, but like I've been, man, I am fucking proud of myself, course I am. Like I said, I've not killed anyone. I'll never let any cunt get me down you know what I mean? No matter who they are still gotta keep one eye on the prize, you know what I mean? But yeah, like, you know, no one's invincible. But... you gotta feel like you can get out of it you know what I mean? Without a doubt, and you make it better. MUSIC: "All My People/All Mankind" by Liam Gallagher # Hold tight, / got what you need # # Speak now # # Or forever hold your peace. # LIAM: All of a sudden, Chris Martin is fucking emailing me. I was going, "What does he fucking want?" So I was going, "what's he after? What the fuck's he after?" # Showboats not up to speed # # High out. # LIAM: And then I heard he was doing this benefit gig and that and then he goes, "Would you do 'Live Forever'?" I was going, "Yeah, I'll do that, man. Let's do it." # it’s my time # DEBBIE: The first thing is said was, "You know I wanna perform, it doesn't matter where we are" so we had to fly from Germany, the same day, to make it happen. LIAM: So we did that, got back met Chris and the guitarist in the toilet and we went through "Live Forever" and then we did it. Liam ’s coming on! AUDIENCE SCREAMS Manchester fans in the areal # Gonna leave you all behind # LIAM: Maybe I have upset him in the past and that, but... I don't mean it. I actually think Coldplay have got a few good tunes, you know what I mean? Listen, and I have apologised, I did say, "Look, I'm sorry for fucking for digging yous out over the years." And they went... "No, no, no. We love it, man. Carry on." So they enjoy it, man. # All the people # CROWD SCREAMS # All mankind. # CHRISTIAN: One love, I think, if you were a young pop fan you're looking round at all these people everybody's got sparkle all over 'em and wigs on. Even Coldplay were dressed like The Tweenies. They had, like, lightning up their pants and brightly coloured trainers on and all that. Suddenly, Liam just turned up in a parka albeit an orange one and just stands there and sings. It's gotta be refreshing, even if you're 14. # ...l’m alive # # Get on up # # Get on up # # Gonna see now l’m alive. # LIAM: I just like making music. Music is what I do. You know what I mean? I can't really do anything else. I don't wanna be a spaceman. I don't wanna be a deep sea diver, I don't wanna sell flowers. I just want to sing good old rock and roll music and when I don't do it, it fucking drives me mad. I found my place in life and it's in front of that microphone stand. I think it was just a natural thing to make a record. It's always good to get things off your chest. Some people find that through the end of a bottle... or like a spliff, or a line of coke or fucking a shot of heroin, or... whatever, y'know what I mean? It's nice to do it through music, it's nice and safe, it's good for your health you know what I mean? There was once, I'd gone for a little run in the morning fucking come out and I could hear proper boom, boom... I was thinking, "Where the fuck's that coming from?" I get in the woods and, on my fucking life there's about 200 fucking kids right in the woods, full-on fucking raving and I'm fucking running past, felt like a right cunt. Loads of people spangled on the side on the bench all tripping. I'm sure they was going "I'm sure the fuck I've just seen that dick out of Oasis." CAMERAMAN LAUGHS — Fucking in shorts, running. "What's he doing running? He should be here fucking sniffing fucking cocaine." Gallagher released his first solo single today. # You would keep the secrets in ya # Congratulations! — On what? On your record! — AUDIENCE LAUGHS # / think you know # And the album is out today. Oh yeah, it's out today, yeah. — AUDIENCE LAUGHS # Anyone can see right through your eyes # It does feel like it's a youthful record. LIAM: For me, it's rock and roll, guitar music. It's got a lot of swagger, man, and it's got a bit of a stomp it's got a bit more of a groove than a lot of Oasis songs and that cos we were... not really groovy. # Wall of glass. # I do love Dublin. BONEHEAD (VO): / think he was well aware there ’3 knives being sharpened ready you know, and if he come out with a fucking f/opper if it just wasn’t quite up to fucking scratch then them knives would've come out and stabbed him in the back. But you ’re not whoever from this two-bit indie fucking band who ’s just embarking on a solo career, you ’re fucking Liam Gallagher d’you know what / mean? The kids out there are dying for ya. FAN: Oh, my God! How are you? — Young man! LIAM (VO): As far as l’m concerned, all these gigs are... all / care about is getting the fans back. Good man. — THEY LAUGH l ’m just a rock and roll singer in a band and that’s all Hi ever be. That’s all / ever want to be. Liam! — Who's not got tickets? We don't. — Yeah, we don't have tickets. We don't have tickets, Liam, any help? — Write your names down for us. _ Oh Yes! , my God! SECURITY: Do y'wanna write your name down on there and then just put plus one, two, three, four, five. Thanks so much, Liam. — Thanks so much. Much love. As You Were. — ALL: Yeah! Geezers! DEBBIE: He is so cute! — Cute. Cute, man. BONEHEAD: I think Liam being away, as hard as it was for him was probably the best thing he ever did. Would've been easy to just go, "You know what? I was front man Oasis, I tried with Beady Eye hand on heart, you know, it didn't quite work out so I've sacked it, I'm gonna concentrate on my clothing line now." But you will never see him on stage again. The world would've gone, "Good for you, man." They would've done that, but he didn't. FANS: Liam! On me! Me! Liam, Liam, please! BODYGUARD: Fellas, please don't push. PAUL: The expectations change. You suddenly saw him connect with, like, under-20-year-olds in a big way, and that was like... Then you realise it's got legs, suddenly he became cross-generational, you know? So then I thought, this is probably gonna be bigger than I thought, you know. CROWD ROARS FAN: Bringing the new, new stuff. I've been listening to that on YouTube and I fucking love it. All of that's fantastic. — Brilliant, brilliant. Aye, he doesn't need the other fella, he's grand. HE LAUGHS — He's grand. SAM ELDRIGE: You put out a great song and people start to take you seriously. That's the point at which you get nervous because the job is only 10% done at that point in time. You've gotta take it all the way through. JO WHILEY: What are your memories of Glastonbury before ? The very first time you came here with Oasis, was that ’94? LIAM: Yeah, think so, well... after we come off stage, / got me clothes robbed. Which weren ’t that good anyway, and that, but... cos they were, like, from Marks and Spencer’s, but... So, got them robbed and some young lad thought / had cocaine in me hair. Morning. He kept picking the bits of me psoriasis that I'd been scratching all day putting it on their gums and putting up their noses and shit like that going, "Fucking check it out, mate! He's got loads of gear on him", then I went back to the bus and I thought I'll just have a little go myself, anyway, just to see, y'know what I mean? SHE LAUGHS — Didn't work, nothing, didn't work though. I might not be able to use that story on Radio Two. THEY LAUGH HE PLAYS GUITAR MAN: How's it going? — Fucking absolutely fantastic. I've not been this excited about a gig since the first Boardwalk that Oasis did. All of Glas has been well received, the gigs have been well received and that. I mean, there's a long way to go and that, but there's no better feeling than getting on stage to loads of people hopefully and showing 'em what you're made of. # Nothing at all # # Even a soul # Yes, Man U. How are you, mate? — Alright, geezer, how's life? Alright? — Really good. Hey. Big guy. — Hi, how are you? Lovely to meet you. Are you here for the weekend and that or just...? Uh, here till Monday. Monday? Why Monday? Uh... — Has she kicked you out? Yeah. No, no. Why Monday? You not got a fucking house to go to? I'm here with him, till tomorrow and then the Mrs comes tomorrow night, so. I've never been out the front and that, I always fucking just hang about round here but me two kids are here, and they like... — DAVID: Yeah. They're into that weed and shit now, they're like that "Right, we're off down the fucking stone circle" they've fucked off and then come back, look like fucking hippies now they can't speak. Three minutes before I start the intro. So let's get up there, yeah? DEBBIE: Are you ready for this, babes? LIAM (VO): This is me last chance to really, you know, do the thing that / love. if this doesn’t happen, / won ’t come again, y’know what / mean? Cos done Oasis, done Beady Eye, and as great as it was it just didn ’t real/y connect and /’m about connecting. if it’s not big, it’s no good to me it’s no good to you, y’know what / mean? DEBBIE (VO): His kids were there, he wanted to do them proud. / think it was the unknown. / guess just a bit apprehensive of how it was gonna go. He hadn’t been on stage prior to that to see how many people were out there and / don ’t think he was anticipating it would be that big a pull. You know, it’s the middle of the afternoon on the Saturday. / just saw the sea of people. The crowd was absolutely enormous. There were just people as far as the eye could see. l’m sure there was an awful lot of people coming in to go ”Oh, Liam ’3 back, OK. Yeah, saw him on the telly with Coldplay, l’ll check it out. ” Bu there were a lot of people coming not to praise him, / think but to knock him down. Hey, is there any hippies in the house? — CROWD WHISTLES Like proper hippies? DRUMS PLAY MUSIC: "Greedy Soul" by Liam Gallagher # She got a six six six # # / got my crucifix, yeah # LIAM (VO): Them big gigs, if the crowd ain’t with ya they’re the worst places to be in the world, y’know what / mean? # She ’s the Ungrateful Dead # # You ’re getting told # LIAM: You just fucking do your thing, don't you, know what I mean? Try and keep your head together without fucking taking all your clothes off and running round naked going "woohoo!" Y'know what I mean? # You ’re slippery kind # # And it’s a long way down # # When you ’re the wrong way round # LIAM: Just got to concentrate on what you're there for and try and give them the best gig you can. # /’ve got the Midas touch # But apparently it was one of the biggest, y'know what I mean? Yeah, it was mega. It was amazing, man. # When you ’re the wrong way round # # And now it’s all too much. # JO (VO): He returned to being the Liam Gallagher from Oasis when he was that true rock and roll star, and / think he grew. CROWD CHEERS LIAM: You've been beautiful. Look after each other and have lots of fucking fun! CROWD ROARS That was the biggest thing we 'd done yet and it was a huge moment. We knew that was gonna be a bit of a mark on the boards. Everything has to be as good as this and better. # And it’s a long way down # INDISTINCT CONVERSATION # And now it’s all too much # # / got the Midas touch. # That's ten out of ten. PEGGY (VO): His album went to Number One straight away. The mid weeks came through and / think it was 103,000. And we both just sat there and shed a few tears, just... Yeah, it’s been a long time coming. it was even on Granada Reports that night. SHE CHUCKLES To say he had his first Number One album, and that was good. LIAM: Well, well, well. What do we have here? / reckon it looks like a Number One record, brothers and sisters! / wanna thank everyone who bought it l’d like to thank everyone who helped make it. As You Were. PAUL: He's obviously got a child-like charm. It doesn't mean he's a child, I mean he's engaging to anyone. We were out for a walk the other day on Hampstead Heath and... he was there and then the next minute he was gone, I was like, "Where's he gone?" He's doing a selfie with the ice cream man. MUSIC: "Zebra" by Beach House DEBBIE (VO): / think Liam ’s a massive softy when it comes to every area of his life to be honest. The Liam / know and the Liam that's in the public perception are totally different. This is the boss at work. DEBBIE (VO): Like, yeah, he does... he drinks too much probably from time to time, he gets in scrapes he ’s impulsive, he says stupid things, he swears a lot but that doesn ’t mean that he can ’t be soft at the same time. I'll come out the exit, then and I'll meet ya. DEBBIE (VO): And he has a lot of onus on family. Family are really important to him. Two knobheads for the price of one. How are you? — Buzzing, buzzing, mate. # You know you ’re gold # # You don ’t gotta worry none # # Oasis chi/d # # Born so wild... # GENE: Where are we right now? — LENNON: We're in Brussels. GENE: Where's that? — DEBBIE: Belgium. I was gonna wear my GP, Dad, but... Lennon said it wasn't gonna be this bad. Soon as you've had a spliff, you'll feel like you're in Barbados anyway. You'll be like that, "Fuckin' hell, it's well hot here, innit? Look at all them people on the beach! Anyone want a piﬁa colada?" # Your love is stag in the white sand # # Wilderness for miles # # Eyes so mild and wise... # PAUL (VO): His sons are funny. / can just see Liam in the pair of them. The y’ve got different traits but they’re like mini-mes. They think they know it all, and it’s like they know how to play him. / think it ’s hilarious watching him being played by his two kids. l’m like, ”Wo w. ” MAN: I'll get the kettle on in a minute, d'you want a chamomile tea? MAN 2: No, Tetley's, mate, please. Yeah. THEY LAUGH — Full-on proper tea. LIAM: Yeah, I love tea. INTERVIEWER: What's the best... for you? BOTH: Yorkshire Tea. PG Tips can fuck off. — Aye, aye. PG Tips is like a football team that was mega went down to the First Division and it can't get back into the Championships. It's a little bit the opposite way round, the Yorkshire Tea. They got great tea but their teams are fucking shite! He's meant to be in school he's meant to be fucking trying on some fucking blouse walking on in a straight line. Fucking both on a fucking tour bus in Amsterdam on their way to get stoned, the fucking little shits. Wasn't like that when I was young. LENNON: Need to try on my blouse! D'you know what I mean? What you doing? Alright, I'm just gonna get it out then, you dick. What's he doing putting his feet on me all the time? INTERVIEWER: How is it now seeing your dad on stage or the gigs? When you're younger, you're just like, "Oh yeah, like, it's Dad doing his thing." But, I dunno, like, now that I'm 18 you kind of appreciate it more. INTERVIEWER: You must be proud of him? — LENNON: Yeah, well proud, well proud. How's my hair look, alright? LIAM: Today, life is good. Got a good relationship with me kids. They can come to the gigs, man, they can have a laugh and that and it's good. It's all good, man. Lennon's pretty chilled, so Lennon's got the zen side of me. Gene's got the piss-taking side. They've all got bit of a temper and that but they're all polite as well — they're all nice people, man. And I must say, man, the mothers have done great bringing them up because they're good people, you know what I mean? Hats off to their mams. I remember once, I was sat in a coffee shop got some weed, proper stoned, like 900 cats landed on me shoulders. I was thinking if—— — DEBBIE: Shut up. Yeah, loads of cats just all sat on me like that. I was thinking if our kid walks in here now and sees me with about 40 cats sat on me like Jim Morrison. Then there was a Brazilian fucking marching band going past us all at the same as me fucking... losing me mind. INTERVIEWER: And then what, you then did a gig? Then did a gig, yeah. The youth, man. Twenty years of age, man, didn't give a fuck then it was cool as fuck. Captain Birdseye. — Yee... MUSIC: "Fade Into You" by Mazzy Star There, that's one. It's your first one. — GENE: Where? LIAM: Coffeeshop on the corner. This is the nuts, man. # / wanna hold the hand inside you... # / am most proud of him for when he has been scared or wanting to throw the towel in, he never stops. He still keeps going. This time is massive/y different. How many people get a second chance? Yeah, he ’s so grateful. # / look to you to see the truth... # D EB B I E (VO): Antagonistic. Super-sensitive, impulsive. Very arrogant at times, fearless. And more ambitious than he thinks he is. # You ’ll come apart and you ’ll go black # # Some kind of night into your darkness... # Well, he ’3 very thoughtful and he ’3 very considerate and he ’s got a great nature and especially where youngsters are concerned family is everything to him. # Fade into you # DEBBIE (V0): The way he is with me, the way he is with my family the way he is with his kids and his mum is the reason that / love him. # Fade into you # # / think it’s strange you never knew... # l was checking how many shows we’ve done the other day and / worked out that by the end of this cycle we ’d have done 134 shows. Only at the start of Oasis, so ’94 to ’96 did they do any more than that. So you 're looking at a 45—year—old man booked as a young man so for him to do that amount of shows, in the way he sings is nothing short of miraculous. No, I mean I don't mind touring, man, it's a piece of piss but it's just the travelling, innit? And we had a few problems with the travel and that, so that set us back a bit so it's been a bit of a pain in the arse. I got an ear infection at some... Just the usual bits and bobs you know what I mean? Not being well and then having to sing and stuff, y'know what I mean? But you know, it is what it is, innit, man. Following them guys down there. — Let's go. Not for long, gotta scoot. The tour manager that we had lost his fucking mind he was gonna go home, had enough. Watch the shoes, mate. HE COUGHS HE COUGHS Come on, Dan. I ain't fucking playing that, turn around. Yeah! — We love Liam! There's my love for Liam right there. Look at that. Fucking hell, mate, did smack all. INSTRUMENTS TUNE That is well good. — Thank you. Nice one. — Thank you. You're always losing the racket! Catch it! — Really humid, innit? Blocked up nose. LIAM SINGS Rubbish! Fucking hell! CROWD CHEERS — That was bloody shite. I'm fucked, man, it's like a fucking work-out, innit? Had a fucking nightmare the last couple of gigs. I'm getting my fucking tambourine and going home. That's what I'm talking about! They're fucking doing my nut in. At the end of my fucking bed, mate, in ten minutes. Probably sleep for a bit and then I'll be fucking up like a fucking lunatic. The last half an hour has fucking done me in. Over all of it. — Are you really? GUITAR STRUMS GUITAR PLAYS Oh, fucking hell... Fucking can't stop pissing now, that's another fucking thing. LG, always. My heart, he's my God. I was born in 1983 and my dad use to listen to Oasis so for me, I've been listening to his voice for my entire life. It's amazing. Live forever. I love him! His music makes me feel alive. GUITAR STRUMS LIAM: I'm looking forward to this gig tonight in South America. Presidential Suite. Where Macca stays, me and Macca share the same bed. Got here yesterday and I was a bit fucked from the flight and I'm still trying to shake off this chesty thing so got me head down had an early night. I could see 'em out there and I said to Debbie on the way in, I said nah, I mean, there's obviously Oasis records that want to be signed and all that but there's a lot of As You Were there, you know what I mean? So that's proper mega, you know what I mean? There's young kids out there, 15, 16, 17. So, As You Were is their Definitely Maybe, dare I say it. No one can take that away from me, know what I mean? MUFFLED SHOUTS MUFFLED CHEERS I think I'm doing alright, man. Twenty—five years, 30 years I've been singing like a fucking maniac. I think my voice is still in. Holding up well, man. Considering all the shit that I've drank and all the other stuff, y'know what I mean that people have put up me nose for me. I think my voice is half decent. CROWD SCREAMS CROWD SINGS — CROWD APPLAUDS ALL: # Ole, ole, ole, ole # CROWD CHEERS INAUDIBLE CONVERSATION See you later, I'm fucking going, man, my voice is absolutely smashed. I'd love to stand here all night and scream it out for ya but it's sounding fucking horrific so I'm very sorry, I can't sing the tunes. CROWD SHOUTS Fucking stay here all night and do it, it's only gonna fuck it up though. You ain't gonna have fun, waste of time. CROWD SHOUTS CROWD CHANTS: Liam! CROWD SHOUTS LIAM: They didn't get it. Yeah, man, y'know... Sometimes you gotta make strong decisions. CROWD SHOUTS PAUL: It's like Paris 2009. He said his voice went, so that was it. Walked off the stage. Massive crowd there as well, yeah. Not too sure. INDISTINCT SHOUTS Bye, thanks. — Bye. LIAM (VO): Biggest fear is losing the voice, man, without a doubt. it, like, literal/y went. The ﬁrst song, you ’re thinking ”Fuck, this is a long night, ” you know what / mean? You get to the third song in and you ’re just thinking look, this is doing more damage and you’ve gotta bail, you know what / mean? And obviously you let people down and you 're the worst person on the fucking planet. My whole day is about getting on and fucking making their day and singing you know what I mean? So having to get off when you can't do it, yeah, it's shit and everyone kicks off and all that and you gotta take it on the chin and I get it, they've paid money and all that tackle, but... you gotta look after your voice, y'know what I mean? It's like... I just literally couldn't fucking speak for about a week, and... I like the sound of my own voice, y'know what I mean, so that was hell. You gotta concentrate, haven't you, man? When you're doing this. # Come on, come on # # Who are you? # It's half six, the day's nearly over, mate. As far as I'm concerned. I've been up since four anyway. Well, I like to run because it keeps you fit obviously and it's sort of good for my head more than anything, y'know what I mean? I'm never gonna have a fucking six pack. It's just not what I'm about, but... if I haven't been for a run I just feel, like, all over the shop. It sorts me day out, y'know what I mean? When you are 20, any rock star worth his salt getting up doing all this he wants slapping, y'know what I mean? "Are you coming out for a fucking drink tonight?" "No, I'm gonna get up in the morning I'm gonna go and see the Golden Gate Bridge, apparently it's fucking lovely." You just... "Get out of the band." Y'know what I mean? But when you're this age this is what it's about, man! Look at that, that cloud there, man. That's why I want to live forever. I don't wanna fucking die, I don't wanna spend the rest of me days in pubs and bars. Obviously like to have a drink and all that tackle, but... I know when it's time to go to bed now. It's nice just to be back doing your job, y'know what I mean? I thought I'd never get back out here again, y'know what I mean? Just to be honest with ya, after Beady Eye, I thought that's it. I'm never gonna fucking see San Francisco again or LA and all that, so... It's good to get back out and see the world again. Through the music, y'know what I mean? CROWD CHEERS Got someone here who wants to introduce the next song. Slide Away. Yes. — CROWD CHEERS INAUDIBLE CONVERSATION INTERVIEWER: Does it help your throat at all, like, just...? LIAM: What, singing, yeah? Yeah, I think so. Have to open your lungs up, innit? Steam though, man, I went for a steam, sat in a steam before the gig the other day, like an hour before. Right, I'm going in. Ooh, yeah. LIAM (VO): Cos l’ve got that thyroid thing as well where it gets... voice gets really hoarse a lot more quicker than other people ’3. Fucking hell, that is good, man. HE SNIFFS AND SIGHS LIAM (VO): / don ’t smoke during the day. l have probably a couple when / come off, y’know what / mean? Try not to drink as much. Only do two grams before I go on stage now. Whereas I used to do eight. HE LAUGHS Fucking great, innit? Beautiful. I always wanted to come here. But as I got older more appreciated it a bit more, y'know what I mean? INTERVIEWER: Yeah. — LIAM: And now I like it. HaIIe-fucking-Iujah. Y'know what I mean? Some people here are saying you’ve got an arrogant attitude. lhave. That’s what makes Oasis, innit? Is it? — Yeah. Just had problems at home, finding a house, had a sore throat. Cou/dn ’t come to America, that is it. Oh, you come before you fans, do you? — Yeah, course / fucking do. / come first before any fucker and that’s my attitude, alright? DEBBIE (VO): A lot of the reputation that Liam has he ’3 brought on himself 700% so... as much as the media obvious/y liked to blow that up because that's how he is, he ’s impulsive and he ’s a bit silly. I'm sure he regrets decisions that he made that led to other people — well, people that he loves - being hurt. For sure. LIAM (VO): Well, probably me personal stuff, / regret a few things in that... it was all my doing, / took the eye off the ball and got myself into some shitty situations that / should never have got into and then you gotta deal with it, y’know what / mean? Being a bit of a shit husband and the effect that it has on my kids I do regret that. And sometimes you've gotta own your shit, haven't you? Sometimes it's good to meet it head on. It's good for the soul. INDISTINCT CHATTER This is fucking more like it, hey? Sitting around drinking and eating hotdogs all day fucking rubbish! HE CHUCKLES Who's at the front? Molly? My daughter. And then me two sons are at the back here chirpsing on some birds no doubt. Mollywood! — LIAM: Mollywood. LIAM (VO): l’ve met Molly now so she ’s part of the team and that. She ’3 part of the family, she ’s with us all the time. No, no! LIAM: I'm glad it's not fucking hot, y'know what I mean? That's pretty cool there, the palm trees. LIAM: Yeah, it's cool. LIAM (VO): Lennon and Gene, right buzz off each other, man. They love being around Debs and sisters and that so it’s all good. Got a nice vibe to it, man. I'm actually terrified. Of what? — And the rattlesnakes... LIAM (VO): That morning it starts getting really foggy. Just a bit hard work. D'you know what you wanna do yet? — Yeah, I'm into music. INTERVIEWER: You play the drums, is it? Yeah, and guitar. Got this mate that comes over, bass player they make a racket, sounds good. But there's plenty of time, man. Sure people will be going "Oh yeah, you gotta be good as Oasis" but... Oasis weren't that good. We just had a vibe and everyone wanted to join in on it. We weren't great players, y'know what I mean? You don't have to be that good, as long as you got fucking summat about you y'know what I mean? That'll go a long way. I've got a load of good people around me, good energy. Molly's a legend, man, she's been a breath of fresh air. Her being in my life and being in Lennon's life and Gene's life and 'em all together. Debbie and all that tackle, it's well good. It's never been fucking better, y'know what I mean? I thought you could go under it and stand there, have a picture took you can't do that. Maybe you just can't go up there then. — You can't. It's booked. — GENE: You can in the video games. This is real life, Gene, real life. — Should've played a video game instead. Should just play video games, you muppet. THUNDER RUMBLES INDISTINCT CHATTER GUITAR PLAYS # Yo tengo... # DEBBIE (VO): He ’s just really, really happy. if he was to go out tomorrow / think he would feel happy that he ’s... not just the success that he ’s achieved, but... his mum ’s proud of him, he has a great relationship with his kids. He ’s happy with himself. / think he ’s in a really good place. ALL: Cheers! THUNDER RUMBLES Woo! Noel Gallagher, I don't think he'd be too happy with the way it's going for me at the moment, know what I mean? I think he'll be sitting there thinking "This fuck..." Y'know what I mean? "What's going down here?" Y'know what I mean? I think he'd have quite happily seen me in the gutter. Without a doubt. There was a period where there was a bit of a financial problem and that and the only way I was gonna get out of this fucking mess is by doing Oasis, know what I mean? Or music, y'know what I mean? And he didn't give a fuck, mate. He was like that, "See ya." The calls and all that went on deaf ears, y'know what I mean, so... thankfully, through Debbie and the fucking stars and all that, and the way it is I got out of it without his help, y'know what I mean, and now... I'm kind of back on track doing what I'm doing so I don't need that fucker. I don't need his help, y'know what I mean? There's part of me that is a bit pissed off, yeah. But I'm happy now, so it doesn't really matter. And a lot of people go, "Oh, well, Noel's grown up and he's changed." Whatever, he's changed into a massive cunt. I'm still... I'm just still a cunt. I'm not a massive cunt. Fucking Prince Philip and fucking... what's she called? Right, up here. Right, hang tight, this is where the magic happens. Obviously it wasn't like this, but, yeah. So this is, like... this is mine and Noel's original room original fucking plaque that we had. Have a look at that. See, that'd go back there. That's where Noel'd be, I was this side and then he'd have his stereo that stereo that I pissed on was there. And this is the magic switch that I went for one night when I was... off me box, but I missed to turn the light on to go to the toilet, there used to be a toilet there and I fucking missed and I just fucking... so the kid's in bed and I'm just stood there. HE WHISTLES, IMITATES URINATION All over his tackle. And that's when I think the grudge started. My mam would go to work and we'd smoke all the weed here, listen to some tunes then my mam would come back and we'd all be fucking diving out the windows. This fucker, she'd fucking have us cos she'd been out doing three jobs and we'd been doing none. Y'know, looking back at it now, it's like there was summat going down, man that we weren't aware of, y'know what I mean? It's like there was some fucking activity going on y'know what I mean? Whether it's aliens or whether it's spiritual or maybe it's just nish, y'know what I mean? We didn't know that we were gonna be in this fucking band together this world—famous band that would mean so much to loads of people so in the scheme of things, when we were sitting about going, "Fucking life's shit, life's boring" fucking, "What we gonna do today? There's nish going down." Someone somewhere was making plans and I find that shit fucking really good, and thank you. It's interesting. Life's magical when you have a think about it. You know, this little room here, me and him, him over there me there, fucking just... and then we're on fucking stage no wonder we fucking hate each other, cos it's like being in the knick. CAMERAMAN: It is a real shame you don't really speak to your brother, innit? LIAM: No, I know, but it is what it is. I mean, it is a shame but, you know, it's not the fucking Waltons you know what I mean? And I think the reason why we're not speaking is cos he thinks he's Mr Fucking Clever Mr Right, and I think I'm right so we're both stubborn. You know, maybe it's another part of the shit that's going down while we're sitting here going "Oh fuck, it's shit that we're not speaking to each other and we're not in Oasis anymore," maybe... there's summat else going on for the next step or whatever, know what I mean? I mean, if you're working with somebody 20 odd years two of them together, there's bound to be friction, isn't there? DEBBIE: Liam has reached out to Noel a couple of times and each time he's just... not got back to him and this is why he's so incessant on constantly berating him or constantly antagonising him, it's because he misses him. It's his brother. A new year and they're all going to get on together. Yeah. — That's it. LIAM: Me and our bod get on, two out of three's not bad. No, but the way I look at it, darling—— — That's the way I look at it. Life is very short and if anything happened to either one of you-- So is he, he's very fucking short, isn't he? I know, he's as bad as you. — No, he's very short. Ta. Love you. — MARGARET: OK. See you in a bit. — You have a rest. LIAM: Yes. — See you, Grandma. Liam! CROWD CHATTERS ANNOUNCER: That brings us to the last award of the night. It's NME's Godlike Genius Award. CROWD CHEERS What we're about to give out is basically the most overdue award in the history of the NME Awards. HOST: Welcome to the stage, Liam Gallagher. CROWD CHEERS — CROWD WHISTLES Nice one. Thanks. NME awards, right. I wanna dedicate this to me mam Margaret Gallagher, the one and fucking only! CROWD CHEERS I also want to dedicate it to the army of songwriters that I've got. Past and present. Liam, you are the man of the night. How does that feel? Normal. INTERVIEWER: It hasn't changed you though, becoming Godlike? Has it changed me? No, I've always thought I was godlike from the day I was fucking born and your reward ain't gonna change it. CROWD CHANTS: Liam! BONEHEAD (VO): For him, it doesn't matter if it’s two people or 200,000 people he does the thing that he does. He ’s the last great rock and roll singer. You can see from the comeback that he was needed. PAUL (VO): / think Noel probably overestimated the importance of the music and underestimated the importance of Liam. Kids don ’t wanna be Noel, they wanna be Liam that’s what’s sort of come about again. Everyone ’s fucking in love with him. and thinking about it in terms of his brother watching it and digesting it and having an opinion on it and everything he leaves out or puts into a show it’s almost all done for an audience of one. # it was easier to have fun # # Back when we had nothing # # Nothing much to manage # # Back when we were damaged... # LIAM (VO): / believe the fucking people are back on side, y’know what / mean? And that means more than any Number One album as far as l’m concerned, or how many records you sell. # You just clean the pool... # LIAM (VO): All the success of As You Were was good. / think it’d be rude not to do another album, y’know what / mean? # But oh, / remember how you used to shine # # Back then # LIAM (VO): Now look, if/ were to put in this album, / think it’s gonna be good, man. Getting back and doing some gigs and that and see how we end up, man. # My friend # LIAM (VO): if this one ’s good and it’s a success maybe then have a bit of a break, y’know what / mean? # But it turns out # # You only get to do it once. # Right, I'm happy with that. I start going off the rails, me, when I fucking have too much of a break. You need structure. — I do. Like a toddler. Yeah, start fucking just like... I'm knocking about down pubs at fucking 10 o'clock y'know what I mean? In the morning, y'know what I mean, it's his best... I'm more fucking safe on the road y'know what I mean, in the bubble, I think. MARGARET (VO): l’m proud of him, l’m proud of who he is he never changed, Liam. / think that’s why people love him, cos he is who he is. PAUL (VO): To come from nowhere and to sustain for 25 plus years is impossible especially the way he sings. He ’s number one, ain ’t he? BONEHEAD (VO): l’d like to remember him as my mate probably as the greatest fucking rock and roll frontman ever. PAUL (VO): How would he wanna be remembered? Phew... Uh... He came, he saw, he conquered, and he told you all to fuck off. LIAM (VO): / class myself as a singer, a rock and roll singer with a bit of fucking attitude, and that is it. On stage, singing songs, when /’m close up to that mic that is where l’m at, nothing can touch it, y’know what / mean? I think I could get struck by lightning and fucking stare it out just before it hits me and just go like that, back. It is biblical, man.
