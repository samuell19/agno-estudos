I stink of smoke. Again? - What the hell? - I'm really sorry. Every time. It's too hot! What a mess. Unbelievable! Friday. Thursday. Wednesday. Monday. "My Cat" is our theme on Tuesdays. "Catnip" sent us this video. The cat is called Dewdrop. Is he having a nap? He looks so comfortable! Asleep, he looks so dignified. Calico cats are said to be fickle, but "Catnip" says that Dewdrop is always very warm and loving. Recently, Dewdrop has been really keen on this. Yes, a hammock! Check the expiry date! Sunday has it so easy. Glass, can, can. Glass, can, can. Plastic, plastic. We said that I'd fix the guttering this morning, right? Oh, sorry. I'm really sorry. - OK. - Thanks. Why didn't they notify me about that? Good morning, everyone. Tuesday morning's music is Bach's Brandenburg Concerto... Every day is Tuesday for me. Tuesday morning: Bach, bottle and can recycling, a cat show on TV. I live on the most dull and boring day of the week. I can't escape it. I have 7 selves, one for each day. My day is Tuesday. It's been like this since the accident. I don't know who I was before that. I've lived with them ever since I regained consciousness. My Monday self, my Wednesday self. My Thursday self. Friday, Saturday. Sunday. I've never encountered my other selves. We share the same body, so we never meet each other. The notes we write to each other are the only clues I have. I may become unified one day, and return to my original self. But when that will happen, and who that self is, nobody knows. Where is my original? The library's always closed, so I can't go in. I felt someone's eyes on me when I was getting dressed. When I turned around, I saw a man looking at me... through a gap in the blinds. I was so surprised. One of us had asked him to fix the guttering. Why didn't they tell me about it? I apologized instinctively. But there was no need to apologize. I mean, he was the one spying on me, wasn't he? Doctor, are you listening? Huh? I've finished. Oh, I see. That's all for today. I will take my medicine at the specified time, and go to bed before 12 midnight every day. Stable sleeping and waking hours... are important for my own safety. As part of that, I have a duty to submit a daily activity report. This month's signature, please. Sorry it's always you, Tuesday. Sunday caught a big fish again! I wish he'd give us proper information. Memories are important too. Sorry for disturbing you. Well, it's good timing. He's a new trainee. I'm Dr. Araki. I've known Dr. Ando since I was a student. He's talented, as you can see. I'm honored to meet you. Hello. And boring, as you can see. Excuse me. Don't worry. He's a nice guy. Here. 16 years. No wonder I feel old. It's been 2 years. 2 years and 4 months. From your perspective. You wanted to be one person? I'm grateful to you, Doctor. You've grown. See you next week. Today's travel is over. My fingers hurt. It ain't just your lungs, you know? Some packages have come. Excuse me. I told them to get stuff delivered on their own days. The pieces haven't moved. Move one for me. It's yours and Saturday's game. Who cares? He'll never know it was you. You should care about classmates and roommates. We aren't roommates. I don't remember you as a classmate. Oh. This isn't a café, you know? It's a big help. There are no cafés around here. Is that writer OK? He never submits on time. It can't be helped. Waiting for him is my job. Don't do your work here. Do you enjoy that? Not really, but I have to exercise. Try finding something fun. Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, they all have fun. We're undergoing treatment, but none of them care. I see. You don't understand us, Ichinose. We sleep early, and can't travel far. We're all different, so we can't make friends. A year lasts only 52 days. Everything's closed on Tuesdays, even the library. I could borrow books for you. That isn't the point. You're so boring, Tuesday. So come on a different day. Maybe I will. Tuesday's going home music is... the 2nd movement of Dvořák's... Symphony No. 9 From the New World... What is this? Tuesday finishes with Dvořák. Clearing out the fridge. Making a move against my Saturday self. Gathering burnable trash for Wednesday. Recording today's events for all my other selves. I don't want her to borrow books for me. After an all too short day comes a week-long night. See? You can do it if you try. Good morning. It's now 8 o'clock. "My Dog" is our theme this morning. "Rainbow" sent us this video. The dog is called Chiro. Those lovely eyes are so charming! Huh? Already? Good morning, everyone. Wednesday morning's music is... "Morning Mood", the 1st movement... of Grieg's Peer Gynt Suite. Today is... Wednesday? The hospital. It's open! Here. Thanks. Were you OK this morning? Huh? Yeah, I managed. You look different today. No tracksuit. Tracksuit? Those suit you too. Hey... Hey! Your apron suits you! Erm, it's really red. Nobody's ever borrowed this before. Oh, sorry about that. No, it's wonderful. I'll put an order in for the rest. Children wishing to take part in the 9:30 craft class... should make their way... to the kids' corner. I repeat. Children wishing to... Erm... Sorry! I've filled it in. I'll call you when they arrive. Alright. Mizuno, we're starting. I'll be right there. Excuse me. The craft class is starting. Assemble in the kids' corner. Wednesday's going home music is... Johann Strauss II's... "The Blue Danube" waltz. The broadcast committee is taking requests... for lunchtime music. Please send in your requests, to make lunchtime more enjoyable. Some flowers? If you like. Are you OK? Yeah, I'm fine. It's wonderful! The books you ordered should arrive on Friday, but a couple might come later. I'll go and pick them up on Tuesday. Oh, not Tuesday, next Wednesday. I'll be waiting. OK. Please wait for me. Wednesday. Same as usual. An ordinary Wednesday. Right. Oh! I'm gonna pick them up! Last night was wild. Wanna carry on? But you were really into it. What the hell? What the hell? What kind of band is it? Good morning. It's now 8 o'clock. "My Cat" is our theme on Tuesdays. "Tabby" sent us this video... Great! Nobody noticed. Children in the playground and gym... Should return to class and take their seats quietly. He's nervous. Pretend I'm not here. Relax, relax. Did something happen last week? Huh? Look. Sunday didn't have much luck. I guess not. These activity reports. Are they... for monitoring him? Not monitoring. Sharing. To prevent problems in their lives. Their? Yeah. Their. These are from the library. Wednesday borrowed them? How come? Huh? I asked him to borrow them for me. Wednesday did you a favor? Yeah, we get on surprisingly well. Anything happened? Not really. Dr. Ando has a new assistant. I don't really like him. He looks at me suspiciously. Oh. But I don't mind. I'd probably be the same, if I was in his position. Thinking I was faking it. Are you the same? Think I'm interesting? Or weird? What's up with you? Nothing. Don't my other selves get scared? You know, going out. Doing new things, meeting people. Hey. - Be happy! - Stop it! Bye. What was the key? Good morning. It's now 8 o'clock. "My Dog" is our theme on Wednesdays. "Whitechapel" sent us this video... Yeah! Tracksuit. Turning left. Turning left. Good morning, everyone. Wednesday morning's music is... Today too? Yes, today too. Thanks for that the other day. Huh? That's the only one I couldn't find, Oh, I see. By the way, you play music? It sounded lively when I phoned you. Lively? When was that? Two days ago. But you're closed, so Wednesday. Here. Thanks. Mizuno, we're starting. OK. Bye. I see. You came on Wednesday. You're Tuesday, right? No, I'm Wednesday. Tell me what Wednesday morning's music is. Morning? Peer Gynt. What stores do you pass? The curry house and the florist. What's the florist's name? Aha! Scratching your ear is Tuesday's habit. Wednesday touches his chin. Thursday, his glasses. Monday, back of the head. Shall I go on? You told your doctor? You have to tell him. Don't you get it? Hey, don't call him! Why not? It'd cause problems. I'd have to be hospitalized. I have to return those books next week. I see. That girl, huh? What? No. Please. Give me a little more time. There's nothing wrong with me physically. I feel better than ever. Who knows when I can come again? Alright. Promise me. If anything changes physically, you'll tell him. OK? Alright. Hey, stop it! Wednesday's hair is different. Do I really have to? Right now? Of course. No time to lose. By the way, that jacket's inside-out. No it isn't. Erm... Sorry. You noticed this? Yeah. But even inside-out, it looks good. Really? I see! Erm, if you like, we could... Are you free after work today? The thing is, a new library system is being installed, so... I'm sorry. I knew it. But I'm free next Wednesday. Never seen him so happy. Next Wednesday! It's so soon! You have a whole week. For me, it's only two days! How about a movie? Ladies get in for half price on Wednesdays. Only on Wednesdays? What's Wednesday like? I know about his hairstyle now. His voice, his habits. I should imitate him. - I don't know him so well. - What!? In any case, don't tidy up so much. Wednesday's more messy than you. I see. No tidying up. I'll mess the house up a bit. No, maybe there's no need. It's only our first date, so... Nothing much happened. An ordinary Wednesday. Right. Did I write so much? What the hell? Are you OK? Oh, sorry. Sorry. I wanted to borrow some footage of me. Just now... I guess it isn't allowed. No, I mean, you need Dr. Ando's permission. Right, of course. It doesn't matter, forget it. - Sorry for making such a mess. - It's fine. Did you draw this? No, someone else did. Nothing's wrong physically? I'm fine. No problems at all. Enjoying the night? It was really open! At night! Thrilled by a convenience store? It's so different. Experiencing two days in a row. Wanna go back and do what people do at night? Nobody's moved any pieces. You're right. It tastes better at night. Eat with me. I couldn't get hold of Wednesday's footage. I thought you said this was a romance. If a man and a woman are in it, it's a romance. But there are no people. Alright, that one's male, and that one's female. Now you know what movies are like. Are we a monster movie? A psychological thriller? You are what you are. Unique. If... Wednesday never comes back... It's a problem, no matter how you look at it. Don't worry. I'll tell you about Wednesday. If you won't tell your doctor, I won't either. What will you do next? With two days, you can travel. But not abroad. Why? Why do you care about me? Because... we're friends. You should care about classmates. Be happy. My first late show in a while. It was fun. I had fun too. My first movie without blood or monsters. You like those? Oh, erm, sorry. That's from playing music? Yeah, that's right. What do you play? Things like this. And this, various instruments. - No, what music? - Huh? What tunes? Oh, tunes? Well... "Morning Mood", from Peer Gynt. Do you really play music? Huh? I used to hate that tune. Why? It reminds me I have a week of work ahead of me. But now I like it. It's Wednesday morning's tune. When I first met you, it surprised me how much you seemed to enjoy hearing it. Ever since then, I've liked it too. I was so happy when you helped me with the picture book display. In all that wind, I lost one of the backing papers, but it still looks good. I thought we'd always just pass each other by on Wednesdays. But then you came to the library. You chose a book nobody else ever had, your jacket inside-out. You liked the tune I hated. You play music, even though you're tone-deaf! Oh, sorry. Even so, you've become all I can think about. Wanna meet on other days too? You know... I... What's... What? I, er... I have to go! What the hell? What's going on? I saw you here last Tuesday. You didn't seem normal to me. But... shouldn't Dr. Ando... Dr. Ando is under investigation. Huh? Over the last few years, your medical data... has been tampered with. Tampered with? Your condition has become abnormal, but the hospital hasn't been notified. So you're saying... Dr. Ando, he... That's what I was sent here to find out. This is your activity report. There's a camera in your hallway. Yes, but... none of us tell the truth on those reports. On the contrary. Recently they've been more accurate than ever. Have you felt dizzy or unbalanced, or had any other unusual symptoms recently? Please tell me. We need your consent to continue your tests and treatment. We want to save you. That's all. I knew I hadn't written this much. Nothing's moved. Since when? I'm OK. It's OK. Everything's normal. Good morning. It's now 8 o'clock. "My Dog" is our theme on Wednesdays. Hey. Friday. Are you OK? Hey. Is anyone else... Missing. Again. Good morning. It's now 8 o'clock. "My Parrot" is our theme on Thursdays. "Sugar Ray" sent us this video. A cockatiel called Jack, and a Nyasa lovebird called Monchy. Thursday. Yes, hello? Sorry to press you, but have you made much progress? The deadline is today, you know? Yes, it's fine, erm, I have it. Sorry. Just a moment, please. Which one is it? Hello? Hello? Yes, just... just a moment. What? For real? Erm... About the other day... Yes, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. Please forget it. Hey! Here. He had it in his pocket. He must've planned to give it back the following Wednesday. But... I was the one who came on Wednesday. You expected... Wednesday, not me. What are you talking about? I'll get him back for you. The Wednesday that you like. Excuse me, is Dr. Araki there? I'm... Hello? Hey. Hey! Is this thing on? Oh, it is. What do you think you're doing? Just stop it, OK? What the hell? Oh, is this your first time? Don't worry, just take your pills, sleep, and it'll be fine for a while. I've been there, you know? So let's go home, OK? And as for this, forget it. You're Tuesday, right? Hi. I'm Monday. Can you see me? Anyway, that's the score. Deal with it. Bye. Hospital. Hospital. Don't run. It's dangerous! We might get injured. Listen, when you connected with Wednesday and Thursday, I connected with Sunday, Saturday, and Friday. And now we've met in the middle. How did you know that? Look at this. Know what it is? Is it on? You see this red light? Ever since it happened, I've placed these all over. I saw you having fun as Wednesday. Don't be scared. I'm not a peeping tom. That report you faked so clumsily, I rewrote it so it made sense. So now we're buddies, or should I say partners in crime? Got it? Anyway, take a deep breath. Breathe deeply. Are you calm now? Let's talk calmly. OK, leave me a message. Listen. We have to go to hospital. Our condition's abnormal, but Dr. Ando hid it from everyone. Wednesday and Thursday are missing. We have to get tested and treated. What!? I told you to calm down. Treatment? At hospital? They don't see us as human. Like a tadpole's tail, or a scab, they think we should just disappear. I don't like those doctors, you know? Unlike you, I've been a bad boy all my life. If they find out, who knows what they'll do to us? So let's just carry on. Keep quiet and survive. Maybe only one of us will. I have no intention of leaving. The score is 4 days to 3. Monday's in the lead. You saw the night? I've seen it. Sunday morning, Saturday night, and Friday too. I made a friend on Sunday. I played music with other people. Know how that feels? Doing things with others. It's scary, but so much fun. Like a normal person. It was my first time. You too, right? You met someone. Your world changed. If you disappear, I'll live life for the both of us. Hi, I'm Tuesday! Good, right? I've practiced. Let's coexist, until we don't. I get what you're saying. But it's wrong. Wednesday and Thursday have things and people that are important to them. And now they can't say goodbye. We have to get them back. I hate all that stuff. I know you feel the same as me. We all want to be one person. A normal, ordinary, regular person. All I want is to be myself tomorrow. Then I can do anything! You know, I... Huh? What was that just then? This ain't good, not at all. Let's go home and take our pills. We can think after that. I just wanna think and live for myself. That's all I want. Look, we can talk as much as we like afterwards. See? We can do it if we try. Yeah. We can do it if we try. If only... we'd talked like this before. We... Then we could... Can you give me something? Hey. Did you see that just then? It's like our memories... Don't talk anymore. It's getting quicker. If... If? If I disappear... Stop. And ever since then, you've been just one person? Yes. Right then, I'll explain what's going to happen. It's vital that we operate on you. These symptoms have been occurring for a while, but your previous doctor hid the facts from everyone. For 16 years, you were an invaluable medical case. Especially for him. Doctors should never tamper with medical data. From now on, we will suggest new treatment in order to save your life. That means... I'll be just one person? Or seven people? We have no way of knowing. Nobody can explain or prove your claim of being a different person each day. I see. It's as if we never existed right from the start. You can remain as you are, but you'll become more unstable, so... What's happening with my request? It's been approved. You'll see him? Why did you do it? To protect us... from other people? You guys were a miracle... that happened to fall into my hands. I couldn't do anything. I just had to accept you. What are we? Nobody notices if we disappear. But my original self is nowhere to be found. What should we do from now on? Where is my original? You asked me that a long time ago. I thought long and hard about it, but I could never find the answer. But I'm so glad I met you all. It's not your original... but your present self who has to decide what's best. It's been a while. You've grown. No packages have been delivered this week. No. Last week, that writer sent his work in on time for once, so I didn't come here. You missed me? Yeah, I did. How did it go with the girl from the library? What's happened to Friday? I've been alone ever since then. What? How come? I've only been Tuesday. Oh. This is Thursday's cup. It's yours now. I'm alone. I guess that's a good thing. You can go to the library, travel. What else? Anyway, I'll help you. No. There's no need now. Huh? I'm thinking of going away for a while. I remember it now. You came here... at my doctor's request? To observe us? Write an article about us? No. I had a friend once. In elementary school. I was told he died in a car accident while moving house. After I'd grown up, I found an article about him. A boy in an accident. The same day, the same place. When I asked the doctor, I was certain it was my friend. He wouldn't tell me your address. I pleaded with him to tell me. He agreed, on one condition. That you'd observe me? No. That I'd be your friend. He said you had no friends. Nobody to understand you, and be with you. At first, I didn't know what to say. But when we talked, I realized you'd forgotten the accident, and forgotten about me. The boy I used to know was nowhere to be found. Actually, I was kind of relieved. I was glad you'd changed. But when I came on Tuesday... Hello. Hello. I realized you were still you. I decided to become a real friend. Someone who understood you and would always be with you. The boy I knew. That's all I could do for you. No. That's not true. I just wanted to see you. Just a little more, without you knowing anything. Sorry. When Wednesday disappeared, I hoped you'd always be Tuesday. That's what I wished. I knew it was selfish. How awful I was to wish that. That... wasn't your fault. Not your fault at all. Maybe you think that we were always unhappy, but you're wrong. This body was inconvenient, it's true, but we weren't unhappy. That's the truth. So you don't have to... worry about it. How can I put it? Thank you. You loved him. My Tuesday self. Who are you? Sorry, but can you give the cup back? He'll be mad at me if you don't. Tuesday's going home music is the 2nd movement of Dvořák's... Symphony No. 9 From the New World, "Goin' Home". I shouldn't be trying new things. What does this mean? It means we want you to do this. Impossible. There's no guarantee. As I told you... But there's a chance it'll work. So please do it. For us. This is... Your patients' request. Or should I say... "malpractice victims"? This is what I think is best for us. It's lukewarm. Good morning. It's now 8 o'clock. "My Dog" is our theme on Wednesdays. Wednesday morning: A dog show on TV. Burnable trash. Returning library books. The ones my Tuesday self read. Don't worry. I'm doing it. It's fine. I always get it done on time. Yes. Like this? Or this? You don't get it? We bought a car? When did I get a license? Nervous? No. - Yes you are. - No I'm not! Right. Tired? Yeah. Last night's party must've been wild. Wednesday borrowed it? Yeah. We get on surprisingly well. I'm pretty good at this game, you know?
