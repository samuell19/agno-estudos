Gang of Four Paris, present day: the end of November or the beginning of December, the beginning of the afternoon So, listen to me! Oh, just leave me alone! Come on, be reasonable. No, I don't have to, if I don't want to. And so...? And so I don't even want to have a reason for it. And after you ask 50 times, like I know you will, I still won't know! What are you doing here? You've been eating so little that you're going to be sick if you don't eat a little something for breakfast. I don't care about my health, it's fine with me if I'm sick! And you can take this all away because today, I'm not going to have breakfast, or lunch, or dinner! And the same for tomorrow. I want to be angry, and refute all you say until I see Arlequin because they took him away from me. There they are, my proclamations. So, unless you want to drive me completely crazy, stop telling me to be more reasonable! You're getting pretty close to driving me nuts! Raphaelle, I already told you, no more scripts. I don't intend to try. I can see you'll keep your word. And so, if I Another "and so"! Oh, I beg your pardon, this one was a slip, but it's the last one. But, please, consider I thought you stood corrected! I don't want your considerations! But he's your prince, he loves you. I can't keep him from loving me, but do I have to love him? No, because I can't. A child could see it, but apparently you don't. You are the bride he has chosen among his subjects. Who told him to choose me? Did he ask my opinion? If he had asked me, I would have answered, "No, my lord, a woman must love her husband, and I don't love you." Is that a good enough reason for you? But no, he thinks he loved me, he carries me off, and never asks my opinion. He carried you off to give you his hand in marriage. But I don't want to give him my hand! Do you force people to take presents in spite of their feelings? But consider how he has treated you the last two days, aren't you waited on as if you were his wife? Look at the tokens of respect offered to you, the many women at your service... Anything you want. Oh right, anything you want. Okay, cut. Raphaelle, you'll do it when you learn the text. I'm sorry, I just forgot. That's right, you're not here. I don't know where you are, but you're not here. You're not in this theatre. Maybe you're out on a motorcycle. You, Anna, there are some obvious problems with your performance. First, why do you always speak with such force like that? Once you start like that, you never lighten up. We don't hear anything, despite your volume. We don't understand anything, we're not listening. Everyone knows it, everyone sees it, everyone can say it, we don't understand, it's true. There's another thing. Can anybody tell me what it is? Louise? It seems like a whim. Jeanne? Well, Cécile? I agree with Louise. She doesn't seem very angry, we're not convinced she's thinking about Arlequin. What do you think, Anna? I don't know. I know it doesn't work, but When you're in love, people can see it. People should see it, anyway. If you don't feel the situation others see nothing. Have you ever been angry, Anna? Yes, of course. Anger is not a fixed emotion. Anger rises, the heart starts beating, but with you, the anger was superficial. Your anger was static. I thought I was doing it. Here you don't think. You feel, you experience emotion. The theater is made for emotions. Can I ask you a question? We've been working on it for 3 weeks, and I don't understand. When I played the part of Silvia I did exactly what you said, the anger, the fury I objected to it because it wasn't Silvia's anger. You played on your own anger. The words you're saying are not your words, they're Marivaux's words. No matter what we do, it's never enough. No, it's never enough. Well, sometimes. Lucia, you take Raphaelle's place, play Trivelin. Are you sure you like the room? Sure you won't regret it? Yeah, I'm sure. I don't want to carry my things up and down anymore. Sure you've got everything? No, I'm leaving a box with some of my things. I'll pick it up some other time. You'll see, my room's nice except for the ghost. Oh, stop it! Everybody knows you're full of it. I'm not joking, ask Joyce. She was the first one who heard the ghost. Okay. But I bet you're taking it with you in your bag. No, I'm only taking the good memories. Look out! Joyce! Oh, I'm sorry, I'm clumsy. I told you I can do it myself. Well, she was just trying to help you. What happened? Nothing, no big deal. I knocked over the flask. What is that? Nothing! Just a bad memory. You have a nice carpet. Is it from Portugal? Yes, when I left two years ago, it was the only thing I took with me. I'm leaving! Wait! Wait! Why are you in such a hurry? Somebody's waiting for me. Still the same "somebody". Why don't you introduce him to us? Are you afraid we'll hit on him? Yeah, that's it, I'm scared. What about your telephone calls? You can tell me in class. Okay. It would be easier if you gave us the number or address. Oh, I will, but right now it's too complicated. I'll give it to you as soon as possible. Oh, the keys, I forgot, I won't need them anymore. Oh, no, keep them, Lucia has hers. That's nice of you. Besides, you never know. Bye! She seems to be in love. Happiness is a pain in the ass. Do you think we'll have much fun with Lucia? You'll get tired if you don't stop. You know what happened last night? No. It moved. Oh, that's great! Here's something, it's from South Yemen, it's for you. It's from my father, there's a check inside. No reason to complain. How do you say good morning in Portuguese? You say "Bondia". Bondia. I'd be glad to get a check from Limerick every once in a while. That would save me from killing myself. Yes, but that way you would've never met Cécile. And you wouldn't have got her job at the bar. And she wouldn't have found her love. Well, small streams-- make big rivers! Where's this Limerick? In lreland. My parents returned there three years ago. I'll never return to where I came from. Why? I disgraced my family. Did you? You don't look it. I didn't want to marry my fiancé and where I come from, that's worse than a crime. You mean you didn't choose him? It had been arranged. We grew up together. Then there was Paris, The scene, the life. The Seine, the river? The stage, the theater. I wanted to be in a tragedy. I'm rather interested in comedy. I love Feydeau. Jelly? Never heard of it. I'm asking her if she wants some jelly. Sure, why not? Anyway, your parents send you money in spite of your crime? They think I study science. So, you lie to them all the time? Well, yes. That's disgusting. Nothing is worse than lying. And you want to be an actress? Well, acting is not lying, it's searching for the truth. Well, that's debatable. You can always ask Constance. Sure, ask her and be careful with the jam, Pauline. Oh, I don't care about your jam. Anyway, no lying here. I've already suffered enough with lies. Well, there's no reason for lying here. Or for telling the truth. Well, I think we've finished with this scene for tonight. There's nothing more to say. You see, Louise, you're satisfied with what you did. Often the actors judge themselves the wrong way. Sometimes they think they acted well but the show was bad. I'll tell you a story because we're finished for tonight. Two years ago I coacted with one of the biggest stars. She always judged the acting by the applause. So, she watched and said, "A six minute applause, my dear, we're wonderful! "Eleven curtain calls, we're great! Six curtain calls, the acting wasn't so great." Once we went to Holland and we gave the best performance we'd ever given. It was just great. The author and the director cried from joy. And me, I was really happy then. Yes, I'm even satisfied from time to time. But the Dutch hardly understood French and the applauding was just polite, but not more. So, she said to me, "Constance, tonight we didn't do well, but fortunately it was for the Dutch." So, that's the story. Well, see you tomorrow. Has anybody seen my notebook? Thank you. Don't go to bed too late. Raphaelle, you heard me? No cigarettes if possible, no alcohol if possible. Be on time, learn your parts. There's a girl waiting outside. Tell her to come in in just a second. - What time is it? - Twenty to six. Joyce, are you going straight home? Yes. Bye! So, you're going out? Have a good time. You bet! Goodnight. Bye. Can you take this for me, please? Again? What are you doing now? Nothing. How about a drink? Sure, but not too much, I have an appointment later. Great! - Hello. - Hi. What have you prepared? Yes, "Esther's Prayer". Good, so... - Shall I begin? - Yes. Oh, my sovereign King! Here I stand trembling and alone before you. When I was a child, my father told me a thousand times that you had sworn a sacred bond with us. When in search of a people pleasant to you eyes your love chose our ancestors. You promised them with your sacred lips eternal posterity. Alas! This people despised your law. The beloved nation rejected her faith. She repudiated her spouse and her father and paid tribute to other gods. Now she is serving a foreign king. But being a slave is not all she is. They want to cut her throat. Our great conquerors attribute their victory to the power of their gods. And wish that the same mortal blow would destroy your name, your nation and your altar. In this way, disloyalty after so many miracles It's good. It's very good. Have you already acted? No, not in public. - I studied with Mr.-- - Oh, I know. You can join my class this year. Do you know the terms? That's what I wanted to ask you about. I have a parttime job, but it's just to make a living. And your course is very expensive. I mean, perhaps I could pay you later, at the end of the year. Do you really want to be in my class? I've dreamed about it for two years now. Well, now you can stop dreaming. I can't make exceptions, do you understand? What I want from everyone here is a real commitment. I told Cécile, the girl you just passed, the same thing two years ago. She was also very good and she had no money. When you find a solution come back and see me. Goodbye. I hope to see you soon. What time do you have? I can only stay for 10 more minutes. So, do you like the room? Yes, it's nice and quiet up there. At least that way she leaves us alone. You shouldn't talk like that about your new friend. So, how's the new girl? You think she'll take her? She's having her audition now. I never understood how Constance chose us. Do you remember your second time? - The third time. - Yeah, the third time. You said it was your worst audition, and it's then that she accepted you. She took pity on you. Well, I think it's a good reason. What is yours? I judge by feeling. No, but it's true, the more you do in this course, the less you know. Why don't you say something? That way it won't cost you so much. It's costs a lot already. It's always the same with you. Nobody forces you to take this course. If you take it, it's because it has something to offer. You're always here to justify it. She's right. I know the first time she kicked me out, it was for my own good. There's one thing I don't understand. Why are there only girls in our class? At the beginning there were also boys. When was that? Well, 6 or 7 years ago. It's good to work on men's parts. Sure, your problem is female characters. You want to talk about your problems? I have none. Neither with boys nor with girls. And that guy you threw out? What guy? I don't know. The jerk I took the room from. I never kicked him out, he left himself. Why had Constance stopped with the boys? Maybe they were too bad. No, it was just one of her ideas. She gives herself rules and at the start they're arbitrary. I don't think she's arbitrary. She knows what she wants. And if not, she's crazy, It's not crazy to give yourself rules, but she is strange. Doesn't she scare you sometimes? Do you know she lives there? In the theater, what do you mean? Yes, on the second floor, she bought the building. Is that so strange? And have you ever been there? No, I have no reason to go there. Nobody's ever been there, and she never goes out. All right, Jeanne, stop talking nonsense. She has to go out when she has a performance. She does more than give courses. Yeah, sometimes she acts, you know. Is it you that told me she quit acting 6 or 7 years ago? Yes, before starting the courses. 10 or 12 years ago she worked all the time. And after that, I think she left France. I don't know. Anyway, who cares. You look for secrets because she is mysterious. Either you're mysterious or you're not. But you can't explain it. Now, I really have to go. Cécile, you said you'd lend me Oh, sure. But it's too much. I've no change, you can pay me back later. Next week will be okay? No problem. I'll see you, girls. She seems well, doesn't she? You can't refuse it, 3 weeks in Africa, don't refuse! Yeah, it's great, travel, adventure. Listen, I told you, I want to attend my acting class. Photography is how I make money, it is not my real profession. What matters to me is theatre. Theatre! You'll work nonstop, Anna, and you'll regret it. You can't imagine how lucky you are! There will be a book about you, "Anna Van Damme and the Desert". That's all? Listen, I'm nothing. Just an eye. An eye, my foot. Think about it. Not everybody can see The Tenere Desert. I don't like the desert. I prefer crowds. What a coincidence, me too. Do I know you? Everybody knows me. Nobody knows me. Could you free one of my hands? Thank you. There's a telephone call for Anna Van Damme, please. No. Still nothing, I'm afraid. Don't say that, it is worthwhile. I'm sure I'll find her. And how's daddy doing? I'll come by the end of the year. I'll see you, goodbye. You're leaving already? We just arrived. I'm tired, you can stay. Easy, honey. Excuse me. Excuse me, it's my sister. What's going on here? Leave him, let's get out of here! Are you all right? I'm fine. I'll drive you home. Okay, my car's just over here. I live far from here, in Monfermeil, in the suburbs. That's one more reason. After Raincy, I'll tell you the way. Are you better now? I'm fine, thank you. Does this kind of thing happen to you often? No, it's the first time. Why, do I look like I make up stories? You do photography or theatre? Theatre. I do photography to pay for my school. Constance Dumas' course, the best! Constance Dumas? So you must know Cécile Morin. Cécile, yes, she's a friend of mine. If she's your friend, tell her to be more careful picking friends. If she continues like that she may get into trouble. Why are you telling me that? What did she do? How do you know her? We have common friends. What did she do? What, you're friends don't tell you what they're up to? Actually, she's careful, maybe it's better that way. What did she do? Nothing. No, nothing. The ashtray's right there. Who are you? I told you, my name's Henri Demorsais. You're a cop? No, I'm a printer. I mean, I was a printer. A printer? You don't look it. Listen, Anna, you shouldn't judge by appearances. Can I call you Anna? There are different kinds of printers. My line of business was identity cards. I was partners with Cécile's boyfriend. Real identity cards? Real. Really fake. We were making some good money. But it was too risky. The partners got greedy. And now, what are you doing? Now I'm a painter. I paint stolen cars, and I drive them. Stop here, please. No, I'm joking. You want to see my papers? I print art catalogs. Don't make such a face, Anna. I'm not going to leave you here in the middle of the suburbs, not after what just happened to you. Why did you turn left? It's not the right way? No, it's absolutely right, but I didn't tell you. Well, I have an instinct. East-West. So, this is the right way, right? You've been playing with me. Do I look like a joker? I don't know. It's here. Oh, it's a lovely place. Can we meet again? Can I leave you my phone number? You know where to find me, in Constance Dumas' class. Thomas... No, she doesn't know anything. I'm sure it's in the house. No, no warrant, officially I'm on leave. I'll go into this hole whenever I feel like it. You scared me! Me too! - Do you want anything? - No. I had a nightmare. I dreamed Constance kicked me out. I had to recite "Esther's Prayer" and I messed up, I kept reciting "Athalie's Dream". It was horrible. Did you have a good time? I met a guy who knew Cécile. I have to go to bed. Just listen! He said she's in a fix. She doesn't seem to be in trouble. That's right. Her money comes from a trade. False identity cards. It looks like a risky business. What does this guy look like? He's not bad, blue eyes, big nose, some face, you know. No! 10 days ago I met a guy who spoke to me about Cécile. What did he say? I didn't quite get it. Some story about hiding guns, I thought he was trying to pick me up. He gave me his number. 3 o'clock, my god! Did you keep the number? Yeah, I guess. We'll talk tomorrow. The world's full of loonies. What's going on? Anna just got home. I can't sleep. Neither can I. Maybe it's the full moon. I keep thinking too much. I don't even know what about. Well, let's get to bed. Bye, sleep tight. Give me a drag. I'd rather be at home today. I had a dreadful night. - You're not the only one. - I can believe it. I mean, you look pale. Anything wrong? No, everything's fine. We've got to go. Wait. If anything's wrong... I mean, if I can help you, let me know. I know. Tell me, you and all the women who keep talking to me, why must you bother me? Are you being paid to irritate me with your nonsense? Do you enjoy going off about what I should do? I do what I can for you that's the sum of my wisdom. Your wisdom has accomplished precious little. At least tell me where I am wrong. Yes, I'll tell you, yes. I didn't mean to provoke you, ma'am. So, you're a burglar. I am your servant. My servant! Well, then instead of singing the praises of this place, tell me why these five men are spying on me. My love is taken away from me, I'm given these women to replace him, and now I'm expected to be happy. If the Prince is so in love, it's not my fault. I didn't ask him to be. There are plenty of others who'd be delighted to be with him. I just want him to leave me alone and let me have my dear Arlequin, who is no richer, no vainer and no better lodged than I am who loves me, and I love him, and for whom I'll die of grief if I don't see him again. Alas, the poor boy, what has become of him? He must be sunk in despair, because he's so kind. Maybe he's being mistreated. Oh, I'm beside myself! Do you want to please me? Let me get straight to the point. Leave me alone! Calm yourself, please. Leave without a word! Cécile. Yes? This is not a tragedy. I know. Everybody has problems, some more serious than others, but you mustn't carry them on the stage. There are directors who would be pleased to see you act like this, showing there's cruelty in this play. It's true. When Flamina says, "Let's break Silvia's love for Arlequin," it's a terrible plot. But Silvia doesn't know it. Besides, she's not crushed, she's angry. I know what this scene is about. Really? It's "Don't cry, Jeannette." What? I don't want a Prince, tra la la la la la la la la la I don't want a Prince and I want a Baron even less and a Baron even less I want my friend Pierre tra la la la la la la la la la I want my friend Pierre he, who is now in prison he, who is now in prison You will not be with Pierre... Cécile! Pauline, go get her. Leave her, I'll go. I'm sorry. Tell me, you and all the women who keep talking to me, why must you bother me? Are you being paid to irritate me with your nonsense? Claude, will you stop it? I'm upset. And I need some peace. Where's the lemon? Everybody's upset. What do you have to be upset about? It's not about me. It's about Cécile. I'd like to reverse the charges on a call to Los Angeles. Thomas Santelli, Beverly Wilshire, 213-475-7676. She's completely topsyturvy. You say topsyturvy... Well, she's upset. Who are you talking about? Cécile. I'm afraid it's because of her lover. Who knows? I was like that a while back. The next day I landed in a hospital. Is that what that flask was? Yes, I swallowed a little, but I spit up. Nice story. Well, Anna, it happens. It can happen to you, too. And to me. I can understand these things very well. Dying for a man's love? Well, I'm sorry, but I don't get it. For a man, or a woman, it's the same. So, what is love for you? Listen, Claude, love isn't always a burden, a desperate tragedy. I've been with Thomas for three years now and it's been three years of happiness. Oh, cut it out, Thomas calls you at 3 a.m. from Los Angeles, 12,000 kilometers away. You see him, what, once every 6 months? Is that what you call love? Fine, if you're happy like that, but for me that's always been a horror, and it's the same with her. Maybe you want it to be like that? Oh, excuse me! Excuse me, you've got nothing to do with it. Tomorrow I'm seeing somebody I haven't seen for a long time, and for one minute of joy I pay three months of hell. Don't go then. That's easy to say. Of course you should go. One minute of joy, even one minute is worth it. Now cut the crap, I have to read and I need some peace. Besides, I know your nonsense by heart. Try to understand that love is a lot more strong when it's realistic. Maybe if you didn't complicate it so much, it would work. Well, Claude, it's true. You're always upset about it. Her name's Sarah, isn't it? The girl that lives with your father? Not anymore. I know where to find her, but I know it's a bad idea. What I want is not love everyday, I need just a little bit from time to time. From time to time. Do you want some herbal tea? Oh, excuse me. Miss, listen to me... Don't bother me! Excuse me, it's... Act I, Scene I. Is that it? So, you are Cécile Maurin. You know me, Thomas Derville. There's something our friend must understand-- Wait, I don't understand, I'm not Cécile. You're not Cécile Mourin? No, I'm Claude Fayard. You've got the script, you live in Montfermeil. Yes, but Cécile moved out. My train's coming, but what's going on? What is it that her friend must understand? Well, I have no time, I'll explain it some other time. There are no "some other times," never! There's always some other time, Claude. Well, we'll see! Do you understand? I think so. It's already much better now. Start again, please, Joyce, control your look. It's important in this scene. Why don't we try? Give me an example, for instance, a candid look. How is this? It needs a little more work. You're just a woman, you don't inspire me like a man. Forget the test, I can't do it for you. All this is for Arlequin? That's right. That poor boy, I'll deceive him if I don't love him. I'm a woman of honor, but I'll fool him. If he loves you, you'll marry him and get rich. Does that make you feel better about being deceitful? We're but the daughters of the lower-class, now you'll become a lady. So much for my conscience. As a lady, I won't have to love my husband. I messed up. That's for me to say, not you, Joyce. You always do that when she tells you to look at her, the audience has to see it. Your look had to be seen, even at the back of the theatre. It's a big theater. Did you girls in the back see anything? I did. There was a bug in the air. Look out, it's landing! Claude, articulate! Your look must come from your heart. Start again, please. Give me a candid look. How is this? Very bad. Start again. Give me a candid look. How is this? How is this? How about this? You don't know what you're doing. Listen, Lisette is a specialist. She knows how to impress a man. Maybe you're not interested in men? I know how to impress some men, too. Not all of them, but some I do. Another thing, Pauline. These are two sisters plotting a coup. They are in it together. Yeah, we didn't think about that. You should have. I can't find the secret for you. Well, let's have a break. You think she knows the secret? Possibly. And you? Why are you asking me? I don't know. Before, you used to be happy, you smiled a lot, you talked to me. Now you look sad all the time. I'm not sad, you're embarrassing me. I'm sure it's your boyfriend. I'll tell you, it's him. He's got nothing to do with it. Stop imagining things. You're unkind, Cécile, I'm your friend. Well, okay, but I'm also your friend. You just worry too much. Are you coming? A Manhattan with lemon? You must be joking. No, I'd like a Kiss in the Dark, please. Do you know the Kiss in the Dark, Joyce? It depends. One measure of Gin, one of Sherry, and two fingers of Vermouth. Two. I thought you lost my number. I keep them all. Disappointed? Glad, very glad. So, you didn't believe my story? Cécile with the Basques. What, are you kidding? No, you're wrong, and I'm serious. It's true, she's a little strange lately. You see? Salut! Cheers! So, she works for some underground group? And you're one of them, too. I, myself, am a group. I'm a parasite on the others. Are you with, or against Cécile? I'm neither with nor against her. I stand on the side. I've no doubts that the sabotage at the top is a front for the one on the bottom, and the sabotage in France fronts an international one. She's supposed to have hidden guns? They're hidden. Where? I thought it was in your house. Our house? You can't hide a mouse in it. It's a suburban house? Yup. How many floors? Two. Then you can put an arsenal in it. In our four little bedrooms? Where was Cécile's room? Next to mine, I would know if she hid a slingshot in there. Yeah, possibly. Do you live on the ground floor? No, on the second. She had to pass through my room to go into hers. Who lives there now? Now? Now it's Anna's. There she is, over there. This guy is nuts! Yes, we thought we would get him, but he escaped. Can you help me here? I used to know a guy like that. He thought we were made for each other, which gave him the right to ask everybody what I did, where I was, who I saw. How did it end? They locked him up, and I had the best vacation of my life. You know what I think? What? He's a sick guy. He's in love with Cécile, and is following her everywhere. He's not a madman. He's the Social Service, offering anything, friendship, trafficking, loyalty, he's, how do you say it... ballistic, slick, cultured. I can see he impressed you! Why do you say that? I like guys who are honest, ones with only one name. Henri for me, Lucien for you, Desirée for whom? If he was a perfume? A potpourri. Brilliant! If he was a famous personality? Casanova, Pasqua, Jekyll. Hyde! So...? What happened, Sarah stood you up? I wish she had! Did you get into a fight? There were 15 people and she didn't talk to me once. She loves the other woman. I'm sick of admiring her, it's the only thing I'm good at. Forget it, Claude. Things you expect too much from never happen. You'll find love the day you stop thinking about it. Maybe it'll be a man this time. So he'll get me pregnant and then run away. Okay, once more. Oh, how his words have darkened my mood. For my hymen Achilles changed his mind. I'm dishonored, I have to go return. Are you looking for someone other than Calchas? Madame, I do not understand your words. Corinne, what is this movement back and forth at the end? You told me to use agitation to contrast lphigenia's immobility. There's no agitation in your movement. That was an arbitrary movement and it doesn't make sense. Do it again. Madame, I do not understand your words. No, say it in a way that makes sense. Madame, I do not understand your words. Go on. You will, if you just listen. Cruel fate has rid me of a husband; Madame, will you leave me in my misery? Without me, you could not stay in Mycene. Shall the Queen and I depart without you? I wanted to see Calchas before I leave. Why do you hesitate to send him word? In a moment from Argos you shall leave. A moment sometimes clarifies all doubts. Yet, Madame, I see, I'm pressing you too hard. I see what I always refused to think. Achilles... You cannot wait to see me gone. You suspect me of such vileness? To love so furious a victor, who, bloodstained, comes before me, torch in hand and lusting for more killing, having reduced Lesbos to cinders... Yes, you love him Corinne, what did I tell you last time? To physically feel it. Is that why you act so furiously? No, for me, Eriphilia is defending herself. That's what you do all the time, defend yourself. Yelling, but one can't hear a thing. Like at the flea market. If I'm that bad, there's no point in wasting your time. You're wasting your time, not me. Stay here, listen. Corrine, listen to me. You only think about yourself, you don't trust the poetry, you don't work on your diction. Make up your mind, is it the emotion or the diction? What do you want? I want everything. Look at Lucia here, it's her first year. She's audible, the feelings are clear, she's not being melodramatic. You try to score with your tyranny, and you think it works. No, I know it's bad. It's getting worse every day. Last year, I felt your indications were clear. For the past six months, I have not understood. I'm not making any progress and I don't know where I am. You're only worried about protecting your selfesteem. Leave all your petty fears in the dressing room. That's all I want. Thank you... for the dressing room... Do you think I was too hard on her? No? If she didn't get it now, she'll never get it. Jeanne is with her at the cafe next door. She had emotion, that's all that counts. You have to deal with destruction, all the time. You must have destruction and doubts in order to rebuild, create, invent. Destruction and doubt, that's what I have to teach you. How is she? She wants to be alone. I don't think she's coming back. Why did you ask me to come? I want to show you Paris. But I know aris. You think you know, just like all the others. But I'm not like all the others. What do you see? Nothing much. Roofs, not even the Eiffel Tower. And? And what? What's under the roofs? I don't know. People... Yes, people. Lives crossing till the end of time. And beneath that? The subway, sewers, catacombs. Why are you asking? Are you part of a network? You might call it that. What, a gang, a group? Not at all, just the opposite. What then? Brothers in Arms, the Fifteen? Fifteen or twenty, not much more. What do you do? Is Cécile part of it? Not her, but a person she knows. People you ought to stay away from. You mean her boyfriend? I don't know his name, I've never even seen him. Maybe it's better that way. Why, is he dangerous? Mostly to himself and his friends. And for Cécile? Maybe. Do you know Frenhofer? One of your gang? Not at all, he's a painter. A great painter, from around 300 years ago. The unknown master of "Poussin". His most famous work is "La Belle Noiseuse". La Belle what? Noiseuse. It means a woman who likes to quarrel. It was painted more than a century ago, around 1830. We mainly know it through old descriptions and a print, maybe not very accurate. The painting reappeared in Johannesburg, Tokyo, and London a few years ago. It was last seen in Sidney. Funny, how a painting can travel these days, isn't it? It makes me dream. What does it have to do with me? With you, nothing, but with Cécile, or rather her boyfriend. Wait, I don't understand. Do you rob paintings, like Arsène Lupin? No. We are trying to find works of art that have been stolen. I've been tracking "La Belle Noiseuse" for months, I work with Antoine, Cécile's boyfriend. I didn't know these kind of things really exist! It's crazy! Crazy and dangerous. Did you know that art trafficking is almost as lucrative as drugtrafficking? I won't tell you the estimated price of a Frenhofer. Well, Cécile's friend seems to know where it is. That's great! Yes, but there's a problem. He's trying to negotiate with collectors and the robbers, which is a very dangerous game. I want to make sure he understands that. I could talk to him, or actually Cécile. No, don't, it's my problem. This is a secret, Claude, can you keep a secret? I think so. What's wrong? I don't know. I have to go, I feel strange. Will I see you again? Maybe, but I don't know how I can help. You never know. No, don't. I have to go now. Hey, you scared me! You can't play with ghosts, you know! There are no ghosts, only hungry rats. Listen... it's an ancient dance, it's a Polish folk dance When was this house built? I don't know. Maybe during the reign of Louis Phillipe. I'm not good at French history. Is that 19th century? I don't know, I only know I want to sleep. You can sleep in my room. I'll stay here, don't worry. I'm not worried. Why do you think I'm scared? I'm not scared at all, I'm just upset, really upset. One, two, three, four... The night, the moon, take your shoes off. The night and the moon, stop dancing. The night, the moon, take your shoes off. The night and the moon, stop dancing. The night, the moon, take your shoes off. The night and the moon, stop dancing. The night, the moon, take your shoes off. The night and the moon, stop dancing. The night, the moon, take your shoes off. The night and the moon, stop dancing. The night, the moon, take your shoes off. The night and the moon, stop dancing. The night, the moon, take your shoes off. The night and the moon, stop dancing. The night, the moon, take your shoes off. The night and the moon, stop I made you swear not to see me again. My Lord, your duty surprises my presence and what once filled my heart with joy... "My Lord, your presence surprises my duty." And it's your absence that surprises me. Once your dream or nightmare has ended, you will act this scene again in the next few days. Sophie, Marina, your turn. We changed something, you will see. What, that lovely maiden name is a title, dear sister, the sweet charm of which you wish to abandon. And to getting married, dare you look forward? This vulgar plan can make proud? Yes, my sister. Ah, this "yes" have I to suffer? And no aching heart shall I feel? Well, what is it in marriage, my sister, that... Oh, for heaven's sake, forbear! How? Oh, forbear, I pray you! Can't you see that the mere sound of this word is an offense to the spirit? That evil image it conjures up, and on wicked roads it leads the mind? Does it not make you shudder? And can you, my sister, convince your heart to suffer all the word entails? I prepared the scene with Claude Fayard, but... Pauline, what's wrong? Claude called in sick. And Cécile... Yes, I know. Who worked on Flaminia? I did. Okay, so give Lucia the lines. My dear, while I look for Arlequin, who may have stayed a bit too long at dinner, why don't you try this dress? He can't wait to see you. Here. It will fit me, but I'd rather not take it. The Prince wants me in exchange. You're mistaken. Even if he left you, everything would be yours. Really, you don't know him. If you say so... I hope he doesn't ask me afterwards, "Why did you take my gifts? " He'll ask you, "Why didn't you take more? " Very well. I'll take everything. That way, he won't blame me. Go right ahead! I'll answer for it. What are you looking at? Stay like that. You look like "la Belle Noiseuse". Because I'm under the blanket? Because it's the most beautiful foot in the history of painting. Well, I'm thirsty. What would you like to drink? carrot juice. It's in the fridge in the kitchen. Damn it. It took you quite a while. I couldn't find what I was looking for. Your beautiful What? Your beautiful I-don't-know-what. I found her, my beautiful I-don't-know-what. And who is it? It's you, my beautiful I-don't-know-what. Any idea what time it is? Looking at the sun, about five. Then you have to leave, the girls will be back soon. You don't want me to meet your friends? It's not that, but still, you should leave. But Madam, listen to me. You're bothering me. I'll call you. Here's the cake. For someone who's sick, you look pretty good! Bug off. Move over. You don't know anything. Well done, isn't it? Who needs a spoon? And where are the candles? No candles. Oh no? I'll get it. Anna, it's for you. Me! Do you know the story of the big mouth frog? Sure: what's your name, yaaaa? What are you eating, yaaa? Did Raphaelle tell it to you? She told it to everybody. And the one about logic, you know it? No. A guy meets a friend he hasn't seen for a long time. He asks, "What are you in now? " - I'm in logic. - What's that, logic? I'll explain it to you. Do you have an aquarium at home? Yes. So, it's only logical you also have water in the aquarium. Sure. If you have an aquarium filled with water, logically, you must have fish. Of course. If you have fish, logically you must feed them... I miss you, too. Yeah, of course. If you feed them, logically, you must like animals. Yeah, I like animals... Oh, that's great. At the end of the month? You're coming at the end of the month? Well, yes, I am tender and communicative. Okay, if you are tender and communicative, I can then deduce logically, you must love a woman, and you must like spending a quiet evening with her at your place. Yes, I like that. So, you see, starting with an aquarium, logic allows me to deduce that you like being with a woman. Ciao. Te voglio, belle. - That's brilliant! - It is. - Good bye. - Good bye. The next day, he meets another friend. He says: I met Jean yesterday, and he's in logic. - What's that? - Let me explain. I'll give you an example. Do you have an aquarium? No. Oh, no... I didn't know you were one of them. You didn't get it? No. Never mind. Have a drink. What about your dancer? He'll be here by the end of the month for a week. That's great, Anna! If you go again to the Prince of Wales Hotel, bring us some towels, the big ones. Didn't I have a piece of cake? Yes, and it's not bad at all. Great Tintin cake. Ta-tin! Did you invite anybody? No. I'll go. Me too. Cécile, I thought you had left Paris. You're freezing. I walked. Have some St-Amour. And a piece of cake. Here, sit down. cake. Wine. Take off your coat. Not now, I'm cold. How was your vacation? It's so good to see you- - oh, sorry. I'm disturbing you, huh? No, not at all. I'm not very well. I need to talk. I don't have many friends. What are you talking about? This is my third birthday in this house. Of course, you must party with us. I didn't know you were in Paris. Tell her the story about the logic. Why don't you tell her the one about the frog? Cécile, do you know the story about the big mouth frog? No. It's about a frog taking a walk in the forest. I'm sorry. I can't stay, I can't talk to you. It's not you, it's nobody's fault. It's me. Cécile! Cécile! Wait! Mr. Lucas, can you confirm the accusations appearing in today's paper? That's what I said, yes. Judge Bertrand is suing you for libel. What do you say? Nothing. We'll see. Do you think that a gangster's word is as trustworthy as a cop's? I think the truth always comes out in the end. - Was it something we said? - Shut up! It's him. Who? Antoine Lucas, Cécile's boyfriend. I saw him with her at the café. Antoine Lucas was involved in the Bertrand affair, three years ago, when Judge Bertrand was suspected of abusing his rights to the advantage of a prostitution ring in Lyon. Today, Lucas was brought before the court in Versailles, accused of a hold-up and complicity in a murder. A trial seems to be imminent... Josiane? Anyway, it has no connection with the Bertrand affair and would probably go unnoticed by the media if not for the accused, and the charge rigorously rejected by the defense who claims they are being set up. So, this case is headed for trial. In other news today... - You hear what I hear? - Yeah, poor Cécile. I'm not talking about Cécile. - I'm talking about Henri. - Henri? Henri, Thomas, Lucien, Raymond. I don't care what his name is. The guy who's been telling us stories about Cécile for weeks. Well, you know what? He knows about her boyfriend. - So, he's a cop? - Or a gangster. They're the same to me. Which guy? A strange guy, trying to flirt while talking about Cécile. Wait, what does he look like? Not bad, blue eyes. A face, y'know? Why? Just asking. Is there any wine left? This is the last time we're seeing each other. Are you crazy? You lied to me about everything. Your name isn't even Thomas. Stop it. First of all, my name is Thomas. - Second, yes, I lied. - You admit it. I lied to your friends. I needed to see them. They know. Try to understand. Don't be so selfish. Third... This is another trap. I saw Cécile's guy on TV. So? Did he tell all about his life on TV? He said that in the end, the truth always comes out. I hope for him he's wrong. Can I say my third? Hurry, I don't want the girls to see us. Third... I love you. Stop saying that, I would so much like to believe you. I'll say it again and again. But I'm scared. I don't care about your first and your second. Everything is true. That's when, three days later... I'm Judge Vaudeville. The accused, please stand. No, I will not stand in front of a revengeful justice. Your name? You know my name. Your first name? You know it. Counselor, is this what you call a defense? I ask for a calm debate. Why don't you first ask your defendant to calm down? There's trouble for the one who provokes the scandal. There's even more trouble for a low-life stepping out of his boundaries. Gentlemen of the jury, they want to punish this man not for what he has done and for which there is no proof, but for the Lyon affair which you all remember, and in which he was used as a pawn. Don't let them intimidate you. I'm the general prosecutor, Pincemoi Jereve. This can't be true, it's an unacceptable insult to justice. Let the witnesses enter. I'm the widow Ponsardin. I live on the 36th floor. I'm shortsighted, farsighted and astigmatic, but I saw everything on this dark moonless night. I definitely recognize the accused. He shot at the policemen. You are Jean Cliquot's sister, who is accused of having driven through a roadblock. That has nothing to do with it. Admit that you were offered a deal. I'm detective Ragot. This is an intolerable insult to the honor of the police! He shot at us, I'm sure of it, even if the cartridges have never been found. The accused must have picked them up before running away. With his previous offenses, you won't make me believe he's a saint. Will I be judged by my previous offenses? It's like holding your head underwater. In some lives, prior offenses follow each other without there ever being any future. You are not allowed to say that. This is a fair trial with a local jury, beneath the objective eye of the police, who all want you in jail. Plus, your hands aren't really clean, my boy! This is an attempt to disturb the trial. The accused has always been impertinent. His outrageous revelations in the media made certain eminent personalities in justice, police and state very nervous. The scandal has nothing to do with this case, but it still justifies a severe sentence. I demand that you punish this rebel, this delinquent, this hoodlum, with ten years in prison. There was never any proof of Antoine Lucas' involvement in the shooting of Lagny. You will have to decide for the defendant, if there's a reasonable doubt. I ask you to find Antoine Lucas not guilty. There are things hidden behind things behind fear, it's true or not there are things hidden behind things behind doubt, whether free or guilty behind the doubt, free or convicted ah, ah yes, indeed free or inmate for a long time ah, ah yes, indeed free or inmate for a long time there are things hidden behind things endlessly, it's tiring there are reasons for things seeming wrong never miss anything when things seem wrong you look for a cause and the cause is the innocent ah ah, yes, indeed the innocent make the best victims ah ah, yes, indeed the innocent make the best victims Well, I see, all countries seem to be alike. - Even in your country? - Oh, everywhere. Ah, the news. Antoine Lucas was sentenced today to ten years in prison. "This is not justice, it's murder!" Lucas shouted, when the sentence was announced. Nobody knew who was meant. In any case, the police are rejoicing... Here comes Mr. Lucas, surrounded by guards. Mr. Lucas, a few words? "Go home, sleep well!" You heard him... - Poor Cécile. - Shut up, you said that before. - We have to do something. - What can we do? Nothing, there's nothing we can do. But the next day, during afternoon classes... Aren't you coming to the café? No, I have to think. Ciao. She thinks too much. Oh, a cat! In fact, "Miss Tequila", you're working tonight until when? - a.m. - We'll never rehearse. Yes, we can, at 6 a.m. at my place! can we come and see you? There's nothing to see, nothing to drink, everything's fake. - I have to talk to you. - Cécile? The keys which were in the chimney, what did you do with them? What keys? What chimney? What are you talking about? The key I left in my room, I mean, in your room. This is serious, you must give them back to me. There are no keys in the chimney. Yes, there are, I need them. I'm telling you. I don't understand. What keys? - Did somebody come? - Nobody came. Listen Cécile, are you sure? I'm sure. Somebody came for them. I can't believe it, Anna. What did she want? Will she come back to class? Did she say anything about her boyfriend? No, I didn't understand a thing. She said something about keys in my room, and that someone came for them. Who would that be? It's silly. Claude? Laura! claire, what are you doing here? I work at the pharmacy next door. Still studying economics. And you? I'm still taking theatre classes with constance Dumas. Have you heard anything about your sister? Nothing yet, but I'm still searching. I'm in a hurry, gotta go. See you. Why did she call you Laura? Well... because my name is Laura. No. Anna is my sister's name. She disappeared 3 years and 28 days ago, and I'm still looking for her. Maybe one day, I'll meet someone who knows her. Put it down, put it down, you'll break something. Give me those keys, you thief, you liar! Disgusting cheat! I'm telling you, I don't know what you are talking about. I was right to be suspicious. In fact, that's the only thing you came for, and I thought you wanted me, but no, I'm such an idiot. Give me that. Listen... think! If I had come to steal whatever you're talking about, and if I had stolen it, what would I be doing here now? Stop confusing me. It's over. I'm not doing this anymore, I won't let you destroy me. Henri! Lucien! It's Thomas. He's got the keys. This is ridiculous. She's been annoying me for hours with these keys. Do you know anything about keys? The keys to shut your mouth! We gotta frisk him. He took the keys from the chimney in your room. No, it's not him. I've been listening to your shouting for a while now. You were here? I came home first. Your friend didn't take the keys. - I did. - Why didn't you say so earlier? I usually don't intervene when a couple fights. What did you do with those keys? Yes, what did you do with them? Those keys keep the ghosts from sleeping. I threw them in the Seine. Are you crazy? What did you do that for? And what are you doing with this strange guy? He's not strange. He's just a man I love. Listen everyone, I'll explain. - Don't bother. - Please don't. - Wait, there's one thing- - - Thanks. See you soon. Scum! I made you swear not to see me again. My lord, your presence surprises my duty; And what once filled my heart with joy, is now a cause for suffering. Do you dare ignore it? And seeing you is causing me such pain; Is your pain less than mine? Are we both suffering less for sighing together? Go, content yourself with seeing me tremble. And with your dubious triumph, have mercy. Don't harass me into shameful sighing. Surena, I know just what it costs my heart to see you, but he who seeks to die must seek the means. Madam, the hour is nigh, and tomorrow, your faith commands you to forget me. I have but today, this moment of my life. Forgive Love for sacrificing it to you, and let me breathe this sigh... and let me breathe this sigh at your feet. For my final joy is giving my soul to you. Eurydice and my soul, my lord, you deem it strong enough, as not to fear for it. Might not the sighs so fatal to your life gain equal powers over me? Live, my lord, live, and let my desire be equal to your passion's fire. Trespassing now seems all too sweet, and I haven't done my share of suffering yet. Let a dark sorrow consume me slowly, let me fully taste its bitterness. Death shall not set me free, I want to love always, suffer always, die always. But can you forgive a weakness I admit amidst this stinging fatal tenderness? Could you, my lord, convince yourself to let a fleeting happiness alleviate the deepest pain? Surena, to what joy can the miserable aspire, who, after so many favors, is devoured by his own passion? What can I do in my present state? This is the tenth time you arrive in the middle of a scene. Next time you can't get up, stay in bed. Are you jealous? - It's not my fault. - It's never your fault. What was it this time? A motorcycle- accident? No, but the police stopped everybody. They announced it on the radio. The guy who was sentenced the other day, Antoine Lucas. Well...? He escaped last night during his transfer. Did you say Antoine Lucas? Antoine Lucas escaped. Please stop moving around and talking. What's all this excitement, Pauline? Enough for today. Same time tomorrow. class dismissed. Cécile, wait, I have to talk to you. You need something? - See you at the café. - Okay, I'll be right there. You wanted to talk to me? First, I wanted to tell you, that what you did was good. It was both well-balanced and sensitive. Very good. What else? coffee? - Herb tea, please. - Yes, please. Do we have aspirin? On the fridge. Joyce, can you give it to me, please. Don't you feel well? Not too well. Is it about Thomas? Don't worry, you'll see him again. Yes, we'll see him again. I'm worried about Cécile. She's disappeared. She must feel very bad. Why, because Antoine is a fugitive now? She should be glad. What if they shoot him? Just another police screw-up. Hello. You're having coffee. I'd love a cup. What a day! - Real coffee, or instant? - Real, please. Everybody is upset today. An escape at the courthouse; we'll see heads rolling. - See, he's a real cop. - Yeah, that's me. Thomas Santini, criminal investigations. You want to check? It's almost the same name as your boyfriend's. I didn't do that on purpose, Anna. There are many coincidences in life. Without coincidence, everything would be terribly routine. I like coincidences... and planning them. So, what did you come here for? Get out of here, okay? The minute I have the keys, that's all I want. We told you, they're in the Seine. Yeah, in the Seine. Might as well make me believe in ghosts. What do these keys mean to you? The same as for Antoine Lucas: an opportunity. Have you heard about the Bertrand case and the acquittals? Yes, bribery by the Mafia in Lyon. But they say it's not true. Because three years ago, when Antoine Lucas told everything, he had no proof. Some rumors from prison he was unwise enough to tell in front of a reporter one night he was drunk. Well, a little thief against all these important persons, there's not much you can do, as I'm sure you would agree, except... Except? One of these personalities made a big mistake, an epistolary mistake. Epistolary? A letter. This letter fell into the hands of an old gangster. Let's call him Faria. Lucas was lucky. He spent some time in prison with this Faria and became his friend. When was that? Just before the scandal three years ago. So? Did you keep these keys? No. Before dying of cancer six months ago, Faria gave his treasure to Lucas: some papers in a safe... and the keys are for the safe. Now you know it all. Why didn't Antoine use them six months ago? Because these papers are like dynamite. He was afraid, but now he's got nothing to lose. What do you want the papers for? BIackmail? I like coincidences, but I also like orderliness. Scandals are always a mess. I don't care about Antoine Lucas or his escape. Let him go to Switzerland or Tierra del Fuego. I only want these papers, and I'll find them. You should tell your friend, Cécile. We don't know where she is. She'll get in touch. So tell her the deal. Antoine is free if I get the papers. The ball is in your court now. Think about it. See you tomorrow. This is outrageous! We have to make him leave, no matter what. How are we gonna do that? By calling the police? He's setting up a trap for Cécile and Antoine. He said he didn't care about them. You still believe his lies? How naive can you be? Leave her alone. She's right, for once he said the truth. He could help Antoine and maybe that's his only chance. You must be joking. You actually believe him? Yes. You know what? I don't give a damn. I'm not talking anymore to insane people. I feel so lost. Don't worry, you're not the only one. I'll sleep in the living room. Shall I come with you? Yes. I despise health and I'm glad to be ill. Send everything back, because I will not eat today, or tomorrow either. All I want to do is to be furious and hate you all. Cécile? Yes, of course, you can count on me, I already told you. Okay. And then, after several days... You're wasting your time. It's my way to gain time. What did you gain in the five days you've been here? We haven't seen Cécile, or heard from her. She's not coming to class. You should look for Antoine. You won't find him in this house. Just doing my job, Joyce. I'm not trying to show you how to play comedy. If you really want to help me, you know what you need to do. Excuse me. Tell Lucia to give me the keys. Don't you understand? Don't you get it? She threw them away! You think everybody has your pitiful vision of the world? You think everybody is such a lowlife? Only interested in fighting over stuff, just to sell it? Go on, keep going, you're looking through me. I'm totally exposed. Idiot! That's just what I needed. Someone who reads my soul. You can come anytime, Joyce, I'll tell you my evil plans and you can give me lectures. I know you'd love that. I can see it, deep in your eyes... PIease excuse me... Moralists always turn me on. What's wrong? And you? It's because of the scallions. I'm gonna kill this guy. I'm gonna kill him. I'm warning you, I'm leaving. It's either him or us. What did he do? He's scum. A traitor, that's what he is! Consider yourself warned. I knew that already. How can you let him touch you? What happened? What did he try to do? Nothing, he kissed me, that's all. So say something! - I don't care. - You're not allowed to say that. It's selfish. And if she turns up like last time, he'll lock her up. I don't know, I don't know anymore. Me neither. I love him, I love him... Well, Arlequin, my love? Well, Silvia, my soul? How unhappy we are! Let us love each other always. Yes, but... what will happen to our love? I'm so worried. I don't know, be patient, but I'm no braver than you are. My poor lovely treasure, for three days, I have not seen your beautiful eyes. Look at me to compensate me. I've many things to tell you. I'm afraid of losing you. I'm afraid of somebody hurting you through jealousy. I'm afraid of getting used to your being away from me. Hello. Have you also come to teach me how to behave? Oh, Charlotte Corday now? I'm impressed. Stop that nonsense. Knives belong in the kitchen, right? Come in, come in, join the crowd. So? My room is on the top floor. Come see me some evening, late, so we can talk. I don't want to talk anymore, understand? I see, you want to touch, like St. Thomas. That's right, he's my patron. Excuse me, the kitchen. If I'd known that you were coming after him in good faith, I would have waited. But you're unlucky and I'm not too happy myself. Flaminia, you be the judge. How can a man stop loving Silvia? Is there a heart more sympathetic, more generous? Anybody else's tenderness would touch me less than her goodness. You shall also judge. How is one to behave with a man who always thanks you, no matter what you say to him? I can't blame him, Silvia, you're charming, and in his place, I would do the same. Don't tell him I'm pretty, he knows it. Love me calmly, and help me get even with this woman. Dear Silvia, I will at once. My mind is made up. No matter how you treat me, I will love you all my life. Oh, I'm sure. I know you... Excuse me. I can't hear you... Hello? One moment please. Hello? What's going on? You don't even feel your lines anymore. Do you realize what's going on? Constance says nothing, this guy following us, at a time when we should really be rehearsing. I can't do this anymore. Let's try not to think about it. That's so easy to say. It's all her fault. Look at Lucia, she's totally high! I'd like to be in her shoes now, I feel rather down. Yes, okay... certainly. Please start again, a little earlier in the script. Places, please. And Anna, with more conviction. Claude? Ready? You shall also judge. How is one to behave with a man who always thanks you, no matter what you say to him? I can't blame him, Silvia, you're charming, and in his place, I would do the same. Don't tell him I'm pretty, he knows it... Go on, don't let them distract you. Concentrate. Don't tell him I'm pretty, he knows it. Love me calmly, and help me get even with this woman. Dear Silvia, I will at once. My mind is made up. No matter how you treat me, I will love you all my life. Oh, I'm sure. Mrs. constance Dumas, will you please come with us? Certainly. I will be gone for a few days. If I... If anything happens, I'm counting on you. Anyway, I won't always be there. Whisky? Yes, please. You're nicer than your friends. There's no point in not being nice. Your place is very austere. I like austerity. You had constance arrested, didn't you? Why should I? Because she was hiding Antoine Lucas. Fortunately, he had already left. I've told you a hundred times. I'm not interested in this little crook. I'm leading this investigation on my own. And I'm with you now, because I know you'll give me what I'm looking for. How can you be so sure? You're smart. Obstruction, trafficking in stolen documents, you could go to jail for that. What will you do with the papers, once you have them? I'll destroy them. Or return them to the owner, which is the same thing. Bring things back to order. "Order." That's the only word you seem to know. A bit sad, isn't it? No, the opposite is sad. Saint George and the Dragon. Nice little Raphael. For a cop, you're pretty cultured. From the Sorbonne to the police station, a path straight down. You're a philosopher-cop, right? Correct. Man is a wolf to his neighbor, etc., etc. Interesting. And what's the woman? A man with... or rather without... Well, you know what I mean. Not really. Do you sometimes drink with women? As you can see. I can't see anything. You don't drink? Not alcohol. You know what I think? You have these keys on you. You want to check? Maybe... that's part of my job. Sorry, I scared you, I'm not a brute. You're so warm, have a drink. No, thanks, it's for you. Don't make such a fuss, I didn't touch it. No, I said. Drink. Thanks. Goodbye. Stop him! He has the key! Sorry. Good night. Be brave! You are now in fear. I think he vowed never to have a good time. I admit that I'm afraid. What a man! I must uplift his spirit. Don't be afraid. I'll never love the Prince, I vow... Stop, Silvia. Don't finish your vow, I pray you. Will you not let me swear it? That's nice. I'm glad. Shall I let you vow against me? Against you? Are you the Prince? Yes, Silvia, I have hidden my rank 'til now. So your tenderness be due to mine, let I should lose the pleasure it would bring me, now that you know me, you are free to accept my heart and hand, or to refuse either. Speak, Silvia. Ah, my dear Prince. I was going to make so beautiful a vow! If you were seeking the pleasure of being loved by me, you have found it, you know I speak the truth. I will have it so. Our union is assured. I heard every word, Silvia. Well, Arlequin, I have nothing to say to you. Console yourself as you can. The Prince will speak to you. My heart is full. It doesn't make sense, we can't go on. No, Pauline, don't start all over again. Pauline, we had agreed to go all the way. We're almost there. Yes, we're almost there. But we don't know what we're doing. What will we look like, without constance? We'll look ridiculous. That's why we have to be even better. Or else, we'll have lost everything. True, we would lose everything. Remember what she said. She wants us to go all the way. That's what she said. But I wanted her to see us. That's not what's most important. What is, then? - Not to disappoint her. - Not to disappoint ourselves! Maybe. I think that our acting got worse. Look, we're working on it. So, let's get to work. Okay, let's go, up! Quiet, please. Okay, let's do it again. Anna, did you tell Joyce I would go see her? I did. It made her happy. Well, Arlequin. I have nothing to say to you. Console yourself as you can. What is there to say to me? That I shall leave you. What is there for me to answer? That I know. Say that you have said so, say that I have answered. Then leave me alone, and that's the end of it. - to the prisoners, to one among them, to those who wait for them.
