Wait a minute, darling. Excuse us. Everything's cool. [indistinct conversations] Here he is, Mr. Logan. Just like Old Fletch said. Ain't he beautiful? You should have seen him whoop old Fat Belly and Blue down at the boiler machine. Got a name, boy? Or maybe you're deaf, boy. I asked your name. Speak up, boy. Mr. Logan can't hear you. My name is Leroy. No last name, huh? Fisk. Leroy Fisk. MAN: Maybe Leroy here's a loser. He looks like one. What's the matter with you, boy? Don't you know Mr. Logan don't like no losers? Could be he's a punk. Could be. Town's full of punks. Are you a punk, Leroy? Nigger, you make one more crack about me being a punk, and I'm-a ram your feeble ass through that god damn mirror. Easy, gentlemen. Easy! No need for anybody to get upset, say impolite things. Leroy, Fletch here says you can fight. Fight?! The Lord knows he can fight. Know anything about street fighting, Leroy? Yeah, I know street fighting. I mean professional street fighting. What, different rules? Rules? [chuckles] There aren't many rules, Leroy. Very few. You fight mean, you win mean. It takes a special sort of man. Yeah. Well, like I said, how much you paying? You only got one thing on your mind, boy. Dumb. Look, like I told Fletch, I'm not interested in no chump change. Wow. He's a tough nigger. I done had it with your shit. Let me show you something, nigger. I'll show you what a man like me will do for a nigger like you, sucker. [laughs] Look, like I said, I've been fighting all my life. And I don't need nobody to teach me. Now, I can whoop any honky or jive-ass nigger you throw at me. Got fire, Mr. Fisk. That's good. Maybe we should show this uppity brother it ain't so easy as he thinks. Earl, get on the phone. I think we should have us a little exhibition time. Set it up on the roof. Ooh, look at that! In a beauty contest, you'd come in second to a gorilla. This him? Calls himself Leroy Fisk. Call him Chump Catfish when I'm done with him. Leroy, Moose here doesn't think very much of your prospects. Well, he's big... in the mouth. You people sure are something. - What do you mean, you people? - You know what I mean, boy. Yeah, I know what you mean. You come here to talk a fight. I'm betting my ass on stomping you. OK, you can bet-- Hey, hey, hey! [all shouting at once] Come on, get up. Come on. Come on, baby Leroy! [grunting] I'll kick your ass! Come on! Come on. Aah! [grunting] Get up. Come on, punk! Come on. [grunting] Son of a bitch. [grunting] Get him! [shouting] Get him in his ribs there. [grunting continues] Hey, baby. [groaning] Boy. [groaning] Poor faggot trash nigger. Oh, man. [moaning] [breathing heavily] [moaning] Good to see you relax. How's the face? [sighs] I feel like it doesn't belong to me. [chuckles] My ribs, too. I guess a couple of them might be cracked or something. Ah, no, no, no. Moose knows what he's doing. I made sure he didn't break anything. You'll be sore for a few days. Yeah, that's no lie. You did good. You just don't understand real street fighting, that's all. You're good material. I'm into a lot of things, but all you gotta know is your part of the game. I got five or six boys in my stable. Baby, go get Leroy one of my shirts. Something really up there. Sometimes I match my boys against each other, but most of the time, they square away against the competition. Bets are always heavy. All I gotta do is crack a few heads, huh? [chuckles] The only trouble is the other cats have the same idea. - [scoffs] - I pay big when you win. Sound hungry. I am, but not for no eats. Uh...keep that hungry feeling. Makes for a mean fighter. That's what I'm buying. You in? How's this? Go on, try it on. Yeah, that's right. Help the man. [dog barking in distance] [phone rings] [barking continues] [ring] -Hello? -LEROY [ON PHONE]: Hi, baby? How you doing? -Still tired. -LEROY [ON PHONE]: Tired? How you feeling? How's the baby doing? Uh, well, Leroy, if you were here, you would know. -You know what I mean? -LEROY [ON PHONE]: Hey, baby. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Before you go into that, I got something I gotta tell you. Look, I don't want to talk about it. I don't want to talk about it. LEROY [ON PHONE]: I got something good I gotta tell you, baby. -I don't want to hear it. LEROY [ON PHONE]: I got a job. I got a job. I don't wanna hear it. You haven't been home in two days. I don't want to hear it. LEROY [ON PHONE]: Babe, I'm-- You haven't been home for two days. Lucius hasn't seen you. You hanging around with those goo-hoo lovers? LEROY [ON PHONE]: Baby, I'm trying to tell you something. I mean, I can't take this. I just can't take it. LEROY [VOICEOVER]: I got to talk to you about this, don't you understand that? WOMAN [VOICEOVER]: I don't want to talk about it right now. LEROY [VOICEOVER]: Baby, I got some money. WOMAN [VOICEOVER]: I don't want to talk about it. I don't believe it. I don't believe nothing you say. LEROY [VOICEOVER]: Oh, baby. Listen, every time I got something to tell you-- WOMAN [VOICEOVER]: I'm just tired. LEROY [VOICEOVER]: --baby, you try to-- you cut me off. WOMAN [VOICEOVER]: Look, well, then if you came home and you spent some time with your child. LEROY [VOICEOVER]: I'm out here trying to make a living. WOMAN [VOICEOVER]: And you spend some time with me. LEROY [VOICEOVER]: I'm trying to tell you something important happened to me and my life. WOMAN [VOICEOVER]: Leroy, please. LEROY [VOICEOVER]: Oh, shit. I don't want to deal with this. WOMAN [VOICEOVER]: I can't. I can't stand this. LEROY [VOICEOVER]: I'll talk to you later. I can't deal with this right now. I'll talk to you later. Bye. -WOMAN [VOICEOVER]: Bye. -Hey, the hell with her. I'm going to see Flo. At least I can talk to her. Where'd you get this from, Leroy? I didn't boost it, if that's what you're thinking. It's a gift. Don't nobody just give you nothing like this for nothing. -[laughs] -What's wrong with your face? Oh, never mind that. Just-- just open up the cookie jar. [dog barking in distance] [slow music playing on speakers] Oh, Leroy, where did you-- [laughs] Oh, Leroy. Leroy, did you do something wrong? [laughs] Come here, woman. ♪♪♪ Your mind is just spinning. You sure you ain't high? Baby, you know I don't need that shit. Then where'd you get this money? OK. I ran into a cat today who's really together. He's going to turn me out as a fighter. [laughter] You and Ali. No, not that kind of fighting. What other kind is it? Well, what difference does it make? The most important thing is we are getting out of this rat's hole, and there ain't gonna be no more street corner hustling for me. ♪♪♪ I love you, Leroy Fisk. You know, I don't know what you're talking about, but I ain't seen you this happy in a long, long time. At least your underwear is clean, huh? You're never late. I wouldn't want to worry you, Fletch, when you got enough problems, right? Yeah. Yeah, I could use some relief. What do you mean relief? I give you my services, right? A little extra protection, no additional charge. How's that new boy of yours doing? He's lookin' good. He made quick work of that Pollack fighter Salvatore thought was so hot. -No, shit? -Why don't you get a bet on him? -No, not me, man. -It's a lock. Not a betting man. No betting. Uh...I'm a little short, but I'll make good. Don't be so loose with this thing, OK? Somebody might think you're making a pay-off. Ira, meet Leroy. He's getting behind the game. Leroy. Hi. Leroy here is good on the raw stuff. But where it's gonna count, he needs help. Well, I'm gonna teach you. Street fights stop when one of you is just laying there flat and bleeding and the money is being picked up. [shouting and grunting] What are you doing? Don't stop and start dancing around. [shouts indistinctly] [grunts] You don't leave nothing to chance. How'd Logan find you? Huh? How did Logan find you? I found him. How long you been fighting? Long enough. Do you ever get hurt? Depends on how you mean it. I mean busted up, cold, laid out. I work hard at not letting that happen. You did that? I guess there's no health plan, huh? -No pension plan either. -[laughs] Just fight the fight and hope to live it out. That depends on how Logan did. [grunting] I'm thinking of trimming my stable. You want to buy? Well, if the price is right. I'd like Ira. He could train my new boys. Ira stays. What about that fresh one? What do you got? I got a new boy. The name is Puck Son. [laughs] And man, is he wicked. [laughs] Let's get it on. [crowd cheering] [crowd shouting indistinctly] Hello, Ingo. I'm gonna need a little more time. A week. Two at the most. Well, I'm only asking for two lousy weeks, damn it. What do you want, blood from a stone? Oh, yeah. Oh, well. Yeah. I'm sorry. I lost my temper. I apologize. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I understand. A deal's a deal, but I don't have it yet, damn it! I'm sorry. Yeah, I yelled again. Yeah. What? What's that? Well, you can take it and shove it up your Sicilian ass for all I care. [phone ringing] Hit Fleichman. RADIO ANNOUNCER: ...ahead. My Name is Sue second, in front of Wally Lobb. [continues indistinctly] -Your cut. -Thanks. [radio announcer continues indistinctly] What are you gonna do with all that money? You know, baby, I'm-a get that cat everything that I didn't have when I grew up. Cat's gonna have the best education, he's going to travel, he's going to have a fair look at the world, which I didn't get. Sweetheart, I'm starting to make a little money now, so why don't you just go on out and buy yourself some of those nice things you always wanted? I really want you to have them. [music playing] [whistling] What do you say, Leroy? [whistling] You shoot a good game, man. Who says? I do. My mama taught me never to speak to strangers. Strangers? My name's Heineken. I'm no stranger. No, you're a cop. How'd you know that? 'Cause you wear short pants. [chuckles] Well, that's not very polite, but what can I do, you know? Big bad ass street fighter, right? I've seen you fight a couple of times. You're good, man. Damn good. Hey, man, I'm clean. What's the hostility, man? Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Look, look, I'm not a peckerwood, man. Why don't you tell me why every god damn time one of you suedes sees a police officer, you think he's after something? What's your problem, then? No problem. A little business, that's all. I mean, you're doing real good now, making a lot of money, right? Probably wasting most of it. [horn honks] And me, I like to see a good street fight, especially when it's between a couple of real good colored boys. -Only-- -Only what? Well, it's illegal, man. Well, what ain't? You know, if I was a real sour motherfucker, I could take your ass in right now, you know that? Hey, man, I mean, why muscle me? Why don't you go after the big boys? Boss Charlie? I'm going to pretend like you didn't say that. This is--this is just between you and me. [laughs] I dig. If I want to keep street fighting, I have to help the underpaid piggy with the necktie pay his dues, right? You got it. I stepped on your foot, Massa Heineken, sir. Hey, look, man. All you have to do is play ball, and you can do whatever you want to. I don't care. But if you don't kick in, I mean, if you hold out on me, then you ain't got shit. You stink. Maybe. But don't hold out on me, because I'm going to know when you fight next time, and I'm going to be there for mine. Pleasure meeting you, boy. We'll see you around. [music playing] [shouting indistinctly] $10. [indistinct shouting continues] Make a line here. Hey, make a straight line. Everybody, get in there. Let's go! Hey. We can't all get the... [cheers and applause] [whistling] [cheers and applause continue] Get your shirt on. [indistinct shouting] -Let's go! -Come on, Leroy! [indistinct shouting continues] [cheers and applause] Come on, get up! Leroy! [crowd continues shouting indistinctly] [whistling] [shouting continues] [music playing] You got something for me? No, man. Don't--don't count it. I know you wouldn't cheat me, right? Look, next time the bite won't be so big, you know? I'm just thinking about all those fights you got away with for free. Hey, none of my fights are free. What do you mean, your fights? You mean ourfights, man. You keep forgetting that I'm providing you with a service. -[scoffs] -No. I mean, without me, there ain't no fighting, Leroy Fisk, right? [scoffs] Heineken, you're gonna try to jam me till you take me down to nothing, ain't you? It's wrong for you to talk to me like that. All I'm trying to do is keep you in business. Look man, now, don't do anything wrong. Don't get out of line and make me do something bad, right? All right, look. I'm going on back in. Wait your black ass out here a couple minutes and then come in. I don't want people seeing us together too much, all right? They may think you're paying off the man or something. Yeah, something. Yeah. One of these days maybe you're gonna pay the piper. I'mgonna pay the piper? No, man. You don't understand. See, some of us never pay the piper 'cause some of us arethe piper. You dig? Hey, look. I'm not getting my head torn off just so that sucker can cut himself in. - Now, take it easy. - Easy? Logan, I'm not busting my ass for some cop on the take to steal my sweat and put it in his jar. You gotta keep up. It's expected. It's part of the game. You're not a chump anymore. You said--you said so yourself. I'm a chump if I let Heineken muscle in, Now, you let me worry about Heineken. Just play along with him for a while. You gonna take care of Heineken? Count on it. Just to help you out, I'll arrange some extra fights for you now and then. You can handle it. It'll beef up your take, and you'll be able to square things with the man. Yeah, it's my head that takes the whoopings. I already told you, I'll deal with Heineken, Leroy. Trust me. It'll take a little time, that's all. Look, he's only a sucker fish. You're the shark. Biggest thing you ever had in your pool. You're damn right. [music playing] [tires screech] [pool balls clacking] Heineken's in with Logan. Half of everything he gets from dumb heads like you and me he splits back with Logan. Logan tells him how much to squeeze, and Heineken does the rest. Oh, man, that makes me-- Oh, Leroy. I am no whore! I mean, that Logan is a lying son of a bitch. He told me he was going straight with that dude, man. He said all he needed was a little time. That's part of the con, Leroy. They get us coming andgoing. I thought I was one smart nigger. Come on. Come on, Leroy. It ain't so bad. Look at me. I survived. ♪ I bite the apple, and the apple bite me back ♪ ♪ I was looking at the TV, and the TV was watching me ♪ ♪ Mm-hmm Hey, Leroy! Leroy! I've been looking for you all night long, boy! Where you been? Hey, Fletch. -Hey, baby, what's happening? -Hey! -I did a favor for you. -Hey! Hey, let me tell you about my family, Fletch. Oh. -Let me tell you about my family. Come on down. I had seven brothers and sisters. -No shit. -Seven. Look it here. One, two-- come back here--three, four. How many is that? -Five. All right. Six. This is me. Now, when my mama and my papa split, they divided us up. -You understand? -Well, that's interesting. But it ain't as interesting as what I got to tell you. My mama picked one, and then my papa. Now, this is me. Look, we all been there, Leroy. I know all about that. All I ever wanted to do in life was not to have to kiss whitey's ass. -Amen! -You understand? Amen! And when I thought I had got there, I thought Leroy Fisk was gonna be somebody. -Be somebody! -Be somebody. Be somebody! Yeah, that's bullshit. [laughs] 'Cause a black man can be a chump, too. Your skin is a cage. [laughs] You gon' have to-- how you get out of it? You fight out of it. You talking kind of funny. You better get yourself some coffee. Yeah. Well, let me get my money. I know what's gonna make my friend Leroy Fisk smile. -Yes, sir. -[chuckles] What? I know, listen, that old Heineken ain't gonna hassle my friend no more. How you know Heineken? I know he's been mean to my friend, and I know he's been leaning on you so heavy that one of these days, he's gonna break your back. But the very next time he breathes your way, you show him this. What is this? Every time old Heineken is on the take, he notes it down in that book. What he takes from you, what he takes from the other street fighters, how much the ladies have to pay. Numbers, too. Shit. Every time--every person that has to live with it. And every date, too. You can hang him with it, Leroy. And even old Logan's name is in there. Fat and big. [laughter] Where did you get this? [laughs] I got them prancing fingers. [laughs] Listen, it ain't nothing small. I say get it when I push my old pop for a brain. [laughter] Don't lecture me on morals. No one's talking about morals, man. Look, you don't understand what was in the book. Son of a bitch puts it in the wrong hands, you and me are fucked. You understand that? He's not going to go anywhere with that book. That right? I mean, so far he's been a pussycat, right? You know, only an ignorant redneck like you would be dumb enough to write everything down in one place. From now on, I'll do the thinking around here. Well, who was doing the thinking last night when those two apes tied the rope? Next time you get in a mess like that, don't call on me. Heineken, I don't take lip from dumb cops like you. Now, you give me any more jazz, and you'll never see that nice pension the public's paying for. Yeah, Logan, don't threaten me. I mean, don't dick around with me, man, or I'll cancel your policy. You'll cancel my policy? Just how do you think you're going to do that? Hmm? It's not that tough, my friend. Smart ass cop, huh? Let's see you try it. You may find your own policy being canceled. How do you like that? Heineken? Get over to my place. Now. Leroy? Leroy? Don't bother, Heineken. Jesus, man. I didn't come over here to play games. What are you doing? [switch clicks] [music playing] Is this a game? I didn't have anything to do with this. Something to do with this? No more games. No fights. No money. I am out. Where'd you get that book? How'd you get it? Man, what are you going to do about Fletch? Hey, uh, Mark Heineken. Yeah, look, I got a DOA at 920 North Keen Road. [sighs] Yeah, well, get a wagon over here, will you? Yeah, 313. Look, Mike. It's a coronary. It's very important, OK? OK. [siren wailing] [music playing] Now, what about the book, man? Heineken, get the hell out! I know how you feel, but that's no reason to get unwired. I want out. -You can't walk away. -Why not? Responsibilities. Man, I don't owe you for nothing. I am my own man. Your own man? Bat crap! I own you. Man, you know what you are? You're meat. Just because you got a little money now, you forgot where you came from and what you are. Well, I'll tell you, you're nothing but a nigger living in somebody else's world. Hold it! Hold it, Leroy. I'll blow your brains out, nigger. Now, you move. Don't forget what I just finished saying to you. I won't ever forget it. [door closes] Honey, would you please sit down? You're making me nervous. You want some coffee? [phone rings] Hello? Hey, now, look, let me tell you wh-- So you want to make a deal, huh? OK. OK, Logan. I'll fight Moose. But this one is going to cost you $25,000 extra. And after that, it's over. My contract with you is over, you understand? And you can tell your friend Heineken that this is one fight he ain't gonna get a piece of. Please get away from those gangsters. -Look, babe-- -They killed Fletch, and they will kill you, too. -Everything is gonna be OK, all right? I mean, I'm getting out of the fight game. Look, I'm trying to buy that club from Wilson. Honey, we don't have that kind of money. We will after this fight. I can get it for $50,000 down. I don't care about the club. I just want you to stop fighting. I love you. And I don't want to see you get hurt. Oh, baby, it's gonna be all right. I just don't want to see you get hurt. Hey. It's gonna be all right. It's gonna be all right. Huh? It's gonna be all right. It's gonna be all right. It's gonna be all right, baby. It's gonna be all right. [music playing] It's all been very messy, Logan. Mr. Ingo is losing patience with you. You have no discipline in the running of your affairs. I assure you, after this next fight, everything will again be fine, just the way it was before Yeah, well, Mr. Ingo says it wasn't so good before either. Mr. Ingo has my personal guarantee. Mr. Ingo has always had your personal guarantee. Now, on your recommendation, Mr. Ingo is putting a sizable bet down on your boy. You guarantee your boy can win. I couldn't guarantee it, I wouldn't be here. You put Mr. Ingo down for 50,000. Here we go. Just the two of us. Last card. King queen again. King queen still bets another six. Oh, thank you, brother. What it is, y'all? -You got it, Leroy. -Joe. [speaks indistinctly] What did you get, man? Just that. Oh, 'cause I have to bet three more now, if that's what you want. Thank you, brother. Hmm. King, queen. That's all? King, queen. Jack, queen. -This is my money, man. -Henry got it. Henry, what's the action on the street? [all speaking at once] Logan and Ingo are betting their asses off. Logan and Ingo are betting their asses off? -Mm-hmm. - Yeah? All against you. What? Word is out on the street that you gonna lose this one. [scoffs] Moose is favored three to two. Look here, let me rap to you for a minute. Excuse me, fellas. Let me out of this hand. [speaks indistinctly] Say listen, man, I got $35,000 and 25 more when I win the fight. And I want you to place it all on me. And if you don't win, where are you gonna get the 25 Gs to pay me back? I'm gonna win. Now, you can count on it. Leroy, if you don't win this fight, you better hope you die during the fight. I personally guarantee you won't walk away from this one. You understand? [crowd shouting indistinctly] Keep the line moving! -Keep the line moving! -Hey, Leroy. I know you bet a lot of money today, huh? I did. How you feel, Leroy? 345 on Leroy. [laughs] He's ready, man. He's ready. [indistinct conversations] He better roll against this. What do you mean against him? This is one fight that black boy will never walk away from. You sure about that? Will the sun come up tomorrow? -Come again? -Will the sun-- [laughs] [music playing] [indistinct conversations] [cheers and applause] [shouting indistinctly] [indistinct shouting continues] Hey, lady, your tits are out. [indistinct shouting continues] [grunting] Come on, Logan! Get a taste of some of your own blood, sucker! [indistinct shouting continues] [cheers and applause] This belongs to me. Hey, Avon, hey. What the hell are you doing? I can feel your beady eyes looking at me, Heineken. There's a black lion walking in your jungle. [crowd murmuring] I, uh... Come on, come on, come on. Mr. Ingo's time is valuable. Well, that's what I want to talk about. Time. See, I'll need more time to cover everything I owe you, Mr. Ingo. Why? I lost heavy on the fights. The bets I've had to make good are very bad. Now, that's not Mr. Ingo's problem. That's your problem. You've got other things besides street fighters. You've got women, dope, numbers, loans. My people have been having trouble operating lately. But I think we've gotten over the problem. Yeah? That's just what Mr. Ingo wanted to discuss with you. -Fisk? -That's right. I bought the club. I bought the club. Wilson's club? I bought it. It's ours. [music playing] ♪ I never told a lie ♪ You shouldn't have told ♪ And you watched her shame and lie ♪ Hey, hey! Damn! Look at you, man.

[laughter continues] Let me know when you're through with the jokes, OK, 'cause I got some news for your boss here. [laughter] What's the news, Heineken? What's the news? Well, it turns out the man you had hit wasn't Leroy. It was his brother-in-law. And the other body in the car, that was Leroy's wife, see. Pregnant. What the hell did you think you were going to do, man? You were going to knock him off, and that was going to make you a big man, right? [scoffs] Christ. I mean, if you can't stand the competition, why didn't you just pack it in? What do you send these two apes over there for? What are you doing? You just sit your black ass down. Now, let me tell you something, my friend. You got one angry son of a bitch on the streets now. And you're the one who made him that way. Are you sure it wasn't Fisk? Maybe your information was wrong. Yeah, maybe so, Logan. Only if I--if I was you, I wouldn't go out on the streets alone. [clicks teeth] You know what I mean? [door opens] What the hell are you staring at? Get your junkie ass out of here. Well, how do we know for sure he's looking for you? I mean, maybe someone else had a hard-on for him. That smart ass nigger's too dumb to figure anything out. LOGAN: The only dumb nigger around here is you, Avon. Now there's a mad nigger out there, and I want him found before he finds me. I want every eye and every ear looking and listening. I want all our people tuned into every whisper and every--any second they hear about it, I want to know about it. Now, get your asses out of here! [gospel music] ♪ If you ♪ Get to heaven ♪ Before I do ♪ Wait for me ♪ By the pearly gates As we commit this body to its final resting place, we know today that you can look up and take consolation in knowing that she's not going in the ground, but she's standing over there by the pearly gates, standing there with the one that loved her first. Let us pray. Oh, Father, we thank you today for consolation in this sad hour. We thank you for understanding, thank you for the comfort. [knocking] Well, I'm sorry, gentlemen, but their club doesn't open till the night. -What do you want? -We want to talk to you. About your problem, Mr. Fisk. Well, Mr. Fisk isn't here. Well, maybe you can tell us where he is. Well, I'm sorry, gentlemen, but I can't help you. Like we said, we're here to talk. Now, where can we find your friend, Mr. Fisk? Well, like I said, I can't help you. Beat it out of him. [grunting] I think he would rather die than tell the truth. You listen, and you listen good. We'll be watching all over. And if your friend, Mr. Fisk, shows his face, it's gonna be boom! We're gonna blow him away. He's done. Yeah. [knocking] -Who is it? LEROY: Florence? [knocking] -Who is it? LEROY: Florence. Leroy! Oh, my God. Hello, Florence. They told me you were dead. No, that was Bea and her brother. Oh, my God. Leroy, come in. Thank you. James...took me up to, uh, his mama's house and asked me to stay there for a couple of days. But, uh, well, you know me. I-I couldn't stay cooped up like that. So I just got in my car and drove. No place in particular. I, um...just drove. [scoffs] I must have driven a thousand miles or so. And I came here. -I don't know why. -Come on. Come on, sit down. Thank you. Thank you. Who did this, Leroy? And why? [sighs] Well, I think I know who. And I think I know why, but I'm not sure. I don't know if they think I'm dead or what. Florence, I need a place to hide out for a couple of days. OK, sure. [music playing] Hey, everybody. Look who's here! Boom Boom! Say, my man, lookie here. I want a raw egg and a Coke. -Yes, sir. -[chuckles] Ooh-wee. You the dude? That depends. All right. I heard somebody was looking for me. Thank you, thank you. Maybe.

Say dig, I don't talk in fishbowls. -Here. -No, man. It's too early for me. Look, I want somebody killed, man. [speaks indistinctly] Look it, I can get more if I have to. Then we talk. -Oh, you can do it, then? -Easy. I mean, what if it's a woman, man? It doesn't matter to me, man. A job is a job. Yeah. Right on, man. It doesn't matter to you. [laughs] Hey, man, maybe you don't kill him, man. Maybe you just, uh, find the motherfucker. [laughter] Heard you've been wiring cars. That's my specialty, man! Shit. Wait a minute. I gotta go.

You know, I gots my money, and I pays for what I wants. Oh, what do you want, lover? Huh? Nice, huh? I wear no bra. Hey, baby, I got one thing on my mind right now. Now, where can I find Mr. Charlie? Maybe I'll tell you. Maybe I won't. I got one thing on my mind, like I said. Now, you tell me where I can find Earl, or I'll squeeze this dried prune off. OK. OK. Look at me, bitch. Shacks up with a Chicana. Hotel Washington. [shouting in Spanish] [grunting] Come on. Come on. I didn't touch your car. -[shouts indistinctly] -The truth? The hell you didn't! We got some talking to do, Earl. Let me get my pants. You'll get your pants, baby. Stuffed! Now talk! [dog barking in distance] Talk! It was Boom Boom. He wired the car. Boom Boom? A squirrely guy. He does odd jobs for Logan. Huh?! I tell you, he's not right in the head. You're lying. I'm not lying. [woman shouting indistinctly] [screaming] [helicopter whirring in distance] What are we doing here? We're here for the early show. What are you doing? What are you doing? Son of a bitch. Aah! Just making you a little more comfortable. -For what? -Son of a bitch! [shouts indistinctly] Son of a bitch. You and your pals killed my family. No, no, Fisk. Like I told you, it was Boom Boom. He's a crazy! Let me out of here. Why would a crazy want to do something like that, huh? Crazies don't need reasons. That's why they're crazy. What are you doing, you son of a bitch?! -Let me out of here! -Your hands are clean. Your hands are clean, right, Earl? Right! Let me out of here, you-- -And Logan's as innocent-- hey! -You son of a bitch! -Logan's as innocent as-- -Let me out of here! It was Logan's orders. Something for your listening pleasure. Let me out.

Give me a break! -You want a break, Earl? -Give me a break! Give me a break. Give me a break. [explosion] That looks good. [exhales deeply] Is it your day off, or are you lost? [laughs] [laughs] No, man. I'm not lost. I was-- I was looking for Leroy Fisk. He isn't here. No, I did hear about that. That was too bad. I just wondered, though, maybe if you happen to run into him, you might tell him that I'll give him Logan in exchange for, um, something else. What's this something else? Well, he'll know what it is. OK? Well, if I happen to run into him, I'll see that he gets your message. I appreciate it. I'll see you later. Oh. Oh, God. Do you plan on moving, or do you rent this particular spot? No, I was-- I was just wondering if you fuck around at all. White trash. [chuckles] White trash? [laughing] They don't say white trash anymore. Hey, baby, look. Tell him to be careful. And thank you for looking after him. OK. [music playing] [clinking] Hey, ¿qué pasa? Disappointed in you, fool. Hey, what the hell you want me to do, man? You ain't bringing me nothing, fool. I can't bring you what's not there, man. Ay, caramba! Don't be a smart ass, fool. Hey, man! My arm hurts like shit! -That's your problem. -Hey. Hey, man-- Now, I know, you know, and the street knows that Logan's pink finger is under every deal that comes along. Hey, man, that don't mean that I'm in there. You better be. -Huh? -Hey, look, OK, man. He's up to his ass, man, in hock to Ingo, OK? Ay, man. And Ingo, man, he's-- he's leaning heavy. Hey, look, why the hell-- if you want him, man, why don't you get him, man? Why you rat me out? Hey! Hey, man! 'Cause I don't want him just yet. I want him to sweat a little bit. Hey, man. I want to strike fear into his heart. Now, you think hard and you tell me what you got for me. Ah. Let me see. Oh, I know, man. I can give you Avon. Avon, yeah, man. You need him. -I'm listening. -Look, man. Avon, he's a cocka, you know. He don't let a day go by without getting some pussy, man. That's worth exactly nothing. Now, you better come up with something and come up with it quick, or every day for a week I'm gonna smash up one of your soft toes. Hey, come on, man. And if you keep on disappointing Fisk, I'm gonna rearrange your plumbing so that you piss out your mouth. Oh, man. Now, you take this number. When you get something, you call me. And, Boom... you better guard this number with your life. OK. OK. OK, man. I'll get something for you, OK? Something. You better. Kidney machines cost.

[grunts] Please, honey. Will you take me back? I'll cut down on the stuff. I swear it. Heineken, you believe it? Why did Boom Boom tell you? I was all tore up. I was mad. And Boom Boom, he started talking crazy, you know? Fix talk. Keep talking. Anyway, Boom Boom said I shouldn't worry because Fisk would take care of you just like he took care of Earl. I buy it. What I don't like is it sounds like he's got some smarts. Son of a bitch. What-- what about me? You? For you, this don't change a damn thing. Avon, get her out of here. Let's go. Basically she's got a heart of gold. You should marry that girl, you know that? [indistinct conversation] Hey, Boom Boom. [indistinct conversation continues] Boom Boom! Hey, ¿qué pasó? Logan wants to see you. Hey, tell Logan I'm busy, OK? Is that what you want me to tell Logan? [indistinct conversation continues] Wait a minute. OKAY? Wait, wait, wait. OK, just wait. Meet me here in an hour, OK? Look, just one hour, all right? All right. I don't know explanation, OK? OK? Work for this. BOOM BOOM: What's he want to see me about, man? -Can't you see-- -MAN: He gives me orders. -I don't ask him any questions. -BOOM BOOM: God damn, you see what I'm letting get passed me, man? This better be very well important. MAN: I'm sure it will be, baby. [music playing] Out. Ginger talked. Where's Fisk? -Hey, man, I-- -Oh, I don't want to ask again. I peeped your game. Now you're going to clean yourself up. -Hey, look-- -Let me play with Boom Boom. No, no. I wouldn't lie to you, man. -Let's hear it. -I wouldn't lie to you. Now, where is the tar baby? He's with some bing chick, man. I got a number in my wallet, man. That he's staying with, that's all. -What number? -It's in my wallet, you know? -Let me see it. -It's in my wallet. -Is this it? -That's it right there, man. You know I wouldn't lie to you. I could check this out, man, you know. -I know, I know. -If you're lying-- Would I lie to you? Huh? I wouldn't lie. Let's go. Come on, give me the wallet, please. Thank you.

[screaming] [machinery squeaking] [keys clatter] Well, hello, you black bitch. Who are you? Police. And what are you doing here? Fisk been hiding out here? I can see now why he got his dead wife so quick. You've got a filthy mind. And you got a big mouth. Where's Fisk? Who's Fisk? He's the boy that gave you something to keep warm, remember? A little notebook, black cover. I don't know what you're talking about. Where's that book? I said I don't know what-- You're a smart ass bitch, aren't you? We're gonna see about that.

Man, you know what Logan's gonna do to you when he finds out about this, huh? I love to hear pigs squeal. Hey, what are you doing? What are--what are you doing, man? What is this? God, Fisk, it wasn't my fault. Will you listen to me, god damn it? [laughing] Come on, man. Get me down, will you? Hey, hey. It's a bird. -It's a plane. It's Superman! -All right, man. You had your big laugh, right? Now, get me down! What time do cops come in here in the morning? 5:00 AM, Monday morning. You have all weekend to think about your shit. No, no.

You son of a fucking bitch! I'll kick your ass! I'll kick your fucking ass! [music playing] [phone rings] Yeah? It's Avon. [door creaking] Mr. Ingo, Logan will not bug you anymore. I wasted him for you. And I did it in a very sophisticated manner. I tricked him. I wined him, I dined him, took him to a disco. We were having a lot of fun. And then I killed him. Good. You're number one, Avon. Number one? [laughs] All right! Thank you, Mr. Ingo. All right. Mm, number one. You should have seen the look on his face. And he thought Iwas dumb. I'm busy, Avon. Oh. Excuse me, Mr. Ingo. Relax. Go out to the pool. Have a drink. All right. Thank you, sir. All right. Give me a scotch. Matter of fact, make that a double scotch. [laughs] Thank you, my man.

[chuckling] You took care of Logan? [chuckles] And you took care of Avon. And you took care of Fleichman. And you took care of Fletch. You took care of Bea.
