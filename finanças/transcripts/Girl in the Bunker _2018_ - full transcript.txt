MADELINE: She didn't show up after school. No one knows where she is. DON: Okay. I'm sure there's a reason. Come on, let's go inside. [WATER RUSHING] SAMUELS: Anything? Even if she was here, the areas gotten contaminated by folk poking around earlier. SAMUELS: Well, we've looked around the area, spoken to your neighbors. Any reason why she might'a run away? MADELINE: No. SAMUELS: You folks have any kinda argument recently? DON: Nope. SAMUELS: Ma'am? MADELINE: It's just a stupid thing. Um, she was upset because she forgot her makeup before school this morning. But it was nothing. I know my daughter. SAMUELS: Well, most parent feels that way about their own kids. Having worked a few of these cases, I have to tell you the most likely explanation is she's taken off to a friend's house. She got a boyfriend? MADELINE: No - I mean, that's not possible. SAMUELS: Alright well, there's nothing more We'll check back with you first thing tomorrow. Sure she'll turn up by then. [CAR DOOR] SAMUELS: Let's put out a bulletin, let the state departments know we might have an in danger runaway. KITSON: In danger? Off with her boyfriend more like. [CAR ENGINE] MADELINE: Where are you headed? DON: I dunno. Start up by the main road, I guess. Work our way through the trails from there. [CAR DOOR] KITSON: Case Palmerston? SAMUELS: So you got in a car with your brother and left her to walk? CASE: There wasn't much room in the car. And she was almost home anyway. KITSON: You ever been in any kind of trouble, Case? CASE: What d'you mean? KITSON: Ever done anything illegal? CASE: No sir. KITSON: You sure? You know you could get in a lot of trouble if there's anything that you forgotten to mention? CASE: Yes sir. KITSON: He's hiding something. SAMUELS: Oh yeah. DON: Do you wanna work the edge of the woods? I'm gonna work the bank. AMANDA: She was always, you know, pretty much kept herself to herself. She's not real outgoing. SAMUELS: What about this boy Case Palmerston? AMANDA: What about him? SAMUELS: Well he and Elizabeth, they dating? AMANDA: Ah, just a few weeks. He's like, her first boyfriend. ELIZABETH: Is this too much? AMANDA: No such thing, honey. AMANDA: I think she makes French boring on purpose. Just to torture us. CASE: Hey. You look great. I love your eyes. [CRYING] VINSON: You need to calm down and start accepting your situation here. Ain't no point in thinking of trying to escape. All around this bunker outside - I got it rigged with booby-traps and explosives. And even if you made it past that, I don't have to find you to hurt you. VINSON: I know how you love your brother. Besides, things ain't as bad as you're makin' it out. I got us everything here. Solar shower for hot water. Propane gas stove. Fireplace for when I don't want to cook using propane. Compost toilet. A twelve volt lighting system. Even got a TV. See? All the creature comforts. [POTS CLANGING] VINSON: Hey. HEY. You best quit your crying now. 'Cos the more you cry, the more I'm gonna hurt you. KITSON: So, you wanna see if you can remember anything you forgot to tell us? Or you want us to remind you? CASE: I don't know what you mean. SAMUELS: Rumor has it you gave Elizabeth some marijuana to look after. So now I'm wondering, there anything else you forgot to mention? [TV IN BACKGROUND] Always had my wife do all the cookin' and before that my mom. ELIZABETH: You're married? What's your name? VINSON: Vinson. Looks like you ain't made the news yet. Guess that means nobody's looking for you. VINSON: Hey. I'm being real nice to you here. ELIZABETH: I-I can't, I can't eat. VINSON: If I ask you to eat, then you need to eat. See? There you go. You don't ever want to shut me out. 'Cos you do that, I can be real mean. [CAR DOOR] MADELINE: Anything? MADELINE: So you gonna put an Amber alert for her? SAMUELS: Well, not just at the moment. You see we spoke to her friends at school today and uh, seems her boyfriend likes to smoke pot, and for whatever reason, he asked her to carry some for him on her way home from school yesterday. DON: What boyfriend? You know about this? MADELINE: His name is Case. DON: So who is this kid? SAMUELS: One of her classmates. KITSON: We figure seeing if she has this pot on her that the most likely thing is that she's run off to a friend's place. That doesn't even make sense - In case you found it on her. MADELINE: But she could have just taken it to her room and hidden it - Listen to me. There is no way that she decided to just take off. Her lunch money is still in her room. All her favorite clothes. Nothing is missing... The only explanation is that someone's taken her. her folks because of a little bit of pot? KITSON: There's not a lot else to go on. THOMPSON: You search the area? KITSON: Took out a bloodhound. Couldn't pick up anything. THOMPSON: Is that it? You do realize the first 48 hours are the most crucial? I want a full search party ready first light tomorrow. Let's get a chopper, and as many four-wheelers as we can lay our hands on. SAMUELS: Yes sir. THOMPSON: If she's still alive, we damn well better find her quickly. I don't want to be pulling a body from a ditch this time next week. KATH: Hey... Just keep an eye out for her. [POLICE RADIO] AMANDA: Hey. CASE: Hey. You know you got me in a whole heap of trouble. AMANDA: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. I just... I didn't know what to tell them. Have you talked to Elizabeth's parents yet? Think you should say hello. CASE: Hi. Mr. and Mrs. Shoaf. I'm Case. I'm a friend of Elizabeth's. MADELINE: Ya, Elizabeth's told me about you. CASE: Yep. We've sort of - been seeing one another. DON: You're the boyfriend? I'm surprised you've got the nerve to show up here - CASE: I'm sorry - I wanted to help look for her - DON: Yeah, well it ever occur to you, you might be part of the reason she's missing? MADELINE: Don, don't start this - SAMUELS: Mr Shoaf? Madeline? Ya got a moment? I want you to meet Sheriff Thompson. SAMUELS: Sheriff uh, Thompson, this is Don and Madeline Shoaf, THOMPSON: Please to meet you sir -- ma'am. I know this is a tough time you folks are going through. But I want you to know we've got pretty much every support service in the state looking for your daughter. DON: So are you gonna put out an Amber alert for her now? I'm afraid we can't do that just at the moment - THOMPSON: Well, there are strict conditions have to be met for an Amber alert. First, we need some kind of vehicle description, second: evidence that she's been abducted. MADELINE: But she's been missing two days! But for the moment she's just missing. And there could be a bunch of reasons for that. DON: I don't believe this. It's just the way the regulations are - But rest assured, we're gonna get word out to the media. And we're gonna do everything we can to make sure folks know we're looking for your daughter. MADELINE: Thank you. MADELINE: It's ok. We're gonna find her. I know it. We're gonna find her. CASE: Hey. CASE: Listen, what are you doing Saturday? ELIZABETH: I dunno, no plans. CASE: My parents are away for the weekend - I thought maybe - you know- ELIZABETH: I'm late for math. VINSON: Eat this. VINSON: So. You like the outdoors? Me too. I always loved the outdoors. Guess that's part'a why I like to dig -- the smell of the earth -it's kinda - real. Back in the eighties I used to be in the scouts. We go camping, we'd spend a whole week at a time in the woods... you remember the Rambo movies? VISON: Huh. Well, I guess you're a bit young. Well anyway, we loved those movies, I mean, they were real big back then. I mean, between them and the martial arts, we'd pretty much spend every weekend in 'game mode', you know, playing a different mission. We were like teenage commandos [MAKING GUN SOUNDS] That's the thing 'bout growing up. Just don't get enough time to play anymore. CALLUM: Anything? DON: No. CALLUM: You want to keep working toward Lakeview? DON: I dunno. Maybe we should go look on Benson's land. CALLUM: Sure. [RUSTLING LEAVES] CALLUM: Don, looks there's a bit of a trail here. Want to follow it? VINSON: You make a sound, and I'll kill you. DON: Go on the west side there... [MUFFLED VIOCES] [RUSTLING LEAVES] DON: I'll look over there then. CALLUM: Go ahead... [MUFFLED VIOCES] VINSON: They were right there, and they couldn't even see us. DON: Okay. You ready? Let's get this done. [CAR DOOR] [TV IN BACKGROUND] has began today here in the small town of Lugoff, Elizabeth Shoaf has been missing since Tuesday. According to her friends, she was walking home from school when she simply vanished. Despite a major search of the area, police have yet to find any evidence to explain her disappearance, and for that reason, they're currently treating her as an 'at-risk' runaway. VINSON: Sounds to me like they've already given' up - REPORTER: -she's been abducted. And earlier today, they made an emotional plea for their daughter's return. MADELINE: Elizabeth, if you're out there and listening to this, we just want you to know we love you, we're here for you, and we're doing everything we can to get you back. And if the person responsible for taking her, please don't hurt her -- please, we just want her back. REPORTER: Over 50 local- [CRYING] VINSON: Hey. You need to get it into your head: there ain't nobody ever gonna find you. MADELINE: I know she's out there. I can feel her. KATH: Maybe you should get some rest? It's nearly 2. [GUN SHOT] ELIZABETH: Can I ask you something? Why did you choose me? VINSON: [Laughing] Why, you think you're special? Is that it? ELIZABETH: No VINSON: Look. You're nobody to me. I was watchin' you and your friends a while, and you were just -- right place, right time. ELIZABETH: How long have you been living here? VINSON: Long enough its home. ELIZABETH: I've never heard of anyone living underground before. VINSON: You think I wanna live like this? Think I'm some kinda animal or something? I'm only doing this 'cos I don't have a choice. ELIZABETH: What do you mean? VINSON: Anybody ever hurt you? Well - it changes you. Changes the way you see things. People - ELIZABETH: Someone hurt you? VINSON: Yeah. Somebody hurt me. I used to have a real special wife. Called her Peanut, 'cos she was so cute. And let me tell you she was crazy 'bout me, too. Used to bring me coffee every morning -- you know, playing the little housewife role - Well anyway, one day she just decides she's gonna hurt me she ain't got no reason to. ELIZABETH: What did she do? VINSON: Lying. Spreadin' lies 'bout me. Sayin' I raped her. Next thing you know it, I got police snooping around, makin' accusations. Going to everybody I know and repeating everything she said like it's true. So they only hear her side of things. And I'd never hurt anybody, least of all Peanut. Well, lest I had to. ELIZABETH: So is that why you're here? You had to run away? VINSON: The plan was to bring her here with me. ELIZABETH: What for? VINSON: I dunno. Kill her or somethin' I guess. Never really thought that part through. Anyway, the authorities come and they took her outta state. So that's when I decided on finding someone else. See, you, you're like the bait. Outside'a here? -- All around this bunker? I got it rigged with bombs. Inside, too - see. So one day, when the deputies come lookin' - Boom! Payback. Hey look -- I didn't want this. I'm just doing what I gotta do to make things right. We're in game mode here, and everything's clicking into place just like clockwork. We don't have'ta do nothing 'cept wait. MADELINE: Maybe you should take a break. You've been out every day - [CAR DOOR-ENGINE] MADELINE: Don? VINSON: What are you doing? ELIZABETH: I - I have to go to the bathroom.

Give us this day our daily bread, And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. [HELICOPTER] SAMUELS: What d'you think? Keep working north?

Uses Co2 compressed air to fire a cap at about 50 feet per second. Doesn't use real bullets, but it'll kill up close. [GUN SHOT] VINSON: Aww -- well, I'm pretty good but it's not that hard. You wanna try? VINSON: Okay. So first you gotta take the safety off. ELIZABETH: How'd I do that? VINSON: It's on the side here at the back. Yep, you got it.

Just running her details now. You figure she's the one who's got Elizabeth? THOMPSON: Well, text came from her phone. THOMPSON: Okay. KITSON: Hold it a second - I've been here before.

KITSON: We came here a few times, but he was never around. Katherine Heath was his girlfriend. THOMPSON: Sounds like she still is. KATHERINE: You gonna tell me what this is about? THOMPSON: Have you seen your boyfriend recently? KATHERINE: I ain't got a boyfriend. THOMPSON: Vincent Filyaw? KATHERINE: I dunno. Maybe a year? We broke up.

THOMPSON: Looks like we got ourselves a digger. THOMPSON: Guessing you've heard about It's been going on pretty much in your backyard. KATHERINE: So? THOMPSON: Well, yesterday afternoon Elizabeth's mother received a text message from her daughter on a cell phone registered to your name. As far as you can recall, you haven't seen Vinson in about a year, right? KATHERINE: 'Bout that. THOMPSON: You wanna explain how he could'a gotten a hold of your cell phone? 'Cos the phone company said you only bought it three weeks ago. That is your signature, right? Ma'am, you need to understand that if he kills this little girl and you've mislead us that makes you an accomplice to murder. You wanna think again about the last time you saw Vinson? KATHERINE: I just put food in the trunk whenever he texts me. THOMPSON: How long's that been going on? KATHERINE: I dunno, a while. THOMPSON: You sure you don't know where his bunker is? [TRUNK CLOSING] SAMUELS: So what do you wanna do? THOMPSON: Well, if he's collecting his food here, he's gotta be in walking distance. THOMPSON: I'm guessing he's somewhere up SAMUELS: Well, Marshall Service said they're gonna have a fix on where that text came from pretty soon. Meantime, let's have the chopper take another comb over the area. SAMUELS: Ok. THOMPSON: You know, maybe I was wrong about keeping quiet on that text. SAMUELS: What are you thinking? THOMPSON: Seems to me that the press is gonna find out about this sooner or later. If Filyaw has Elizabeth and she's still alive, maybe we need to gamble. [TV IN BACKGROUND] VINSON: Hey. C'mere. [RUSTLING] [HELICOPTER] VINSON: You'd think they'd stop wastin' gas on that thing. [RUSTLING] disappearance, police announced that yesterday afternoon, her parents received a text message they believed to have been sent by their daughter. According to the sheriff's department, the message makes it clear that Elizabeth is being held in some kind of underground bunker. What more, is police now believe they know the identity of the man most likely behind her disappearance. Vinson Filyaw, a resident of Lugoff, has been on the run from authorities for almost a year to avoid facing charges for alleged sex offences. VINSON: What have you done? Huh? You're spreadin' lies 'bout me too, huh? ELIZABETH: I-I didn't do anything. VINSON: You didn't do anything? You heard the news report, right? They said the message came from my phone! ELIZABETH: It-it wasn't me. VINSON: Liar! Damn! Damn, damn, damn DAMN! You realise they're gonna come looking for us now? You understand that, right? ELIZABETH: I'm sorry, I just - I don't know, I-it wasn't me. I never touched your phone. VINSON: Bullshit. You know what? I should just kill you right now. SAMUELS: Marshall Services confirmed the text definitely came from somewhere up here on Benson's land - if Filyaw's rigged the area with explosives. Let's make ready for first light tomorrow. You said not to tell anyone 'bout that message, and now it's all over the damn news? DON: What if that Filyaw guy sees this? MADELINE: Don, give him a chance - we decided to take a calculated risk - DON: Calculated risk? What the hell is that supposed to mean? This is my daughter we're talking about here. THOMPSON: Look, I know Filyaw, alright? Filyaw's dangerous, but he's also a coward. So chances are, if he knows we're looking for him, he's gonna do what he's been doing this past year, And that, in my opinion, is the best chance we have of seeing your daughter alive again. DON: I hope for your sake you're right. VINSON: Why'd you go an do a thing like that? ELIZABETH: I swear on my life, I never touched your phone. VINSON: What? That makes no sense. ELIZABETH: Please, I don't know what happened, but I would never hurt you -- check your phone. There's no text there, right? ELIZABETH: Maybe the police are just making it all up. VINSON: What? ELIZABETH: To try and frighten you -- like they did before. Please. You need to believe me -- I love you. I just want us to be together. VINSON: What are we gonna do now? Should we pack up and try to get outta here? Or maybe it's better to wait it out. ELIZABETH: I don't know -- but if the police catch us together, they'll put you in jail. VINSON: If we could make it out - Do you think you'd wanna be my wife one day? ELIZABETH: Sure, I would -- but you're already married aren't you? To the woman that leaves the food? VINSON: [Laughs] No. That's my girlfriend, Kat. I was in love with her daughter -you know Peanut. I just called Peanut my wife, because I wanted to marry her. ELIZABETH: What was her real name? VINSON: Lucy. Lucy Jennings. You two went to school together right? That's the thing, people used to be allowed to get married when they were 12 right? ELIZABETH: Right. VINSON: So how can it be right for someone to say two people can't be together when they love one another? ELIZABETH: I don't know - [crying] VINSON: I don't wanna lose you. ELIZABETH: I don't wanna lose you too. VINSON: Really? ELIZABETH: Mmhmm. VINSON: Forever? VINSON: You stay here -- when all this all blows over, I'll come and find you. I love you. ELIZABETH: I love you too. [BIRDS] DON: Listen - I'm sorry for bawling you out the other week. It's been tough, that's all. ♪ ♪ ♪ ELIZABETH: Hello? Hello! Hello? THOMPSON: Hold on a minute.
