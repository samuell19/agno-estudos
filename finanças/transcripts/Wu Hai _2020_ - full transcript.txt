Anybody home? Mr. Yang? Yang Hua, I know you're in there. Come on! It's 1800,000RMB if you pay back today. Otherwise it'll be 2,000,000RMB tomorrow. Just open the door! Yang Hua! Come on, open it! Open up! Damn it! Damn it, open up! No one seems to be in, Mr. Wang. What should we do? Alright, I got it. WU HAI Hey, hold it right there. What are you here for? Think it's a holiday? This is a rehearsal. Stop looking at your phones! Follow their music. Dig into the vibe. Respect the music! Not bad. Keep playing. My man, you're here. Should have given me a heads up. And you respect the music? Oh come on. You lost weight? The last time you were here, it was just piles of sand. Just look around now. It's your design? Design, my foot! I copied it from the web and tweaked it. Didn't cost me a dime. Hey, what's going on over there? It's almost our opening. Get your asses moving! You really made it happen. Of course. Look who's in charge. About my call last night... Well? If you don't pay me back, I'm really going to be screwed. It's not that I don't want to give it back, pal. I mean, you've seen here. I poured my money all into this place. Who'd have thought they'd put our Dinosaur Park under such close scrutiny? Too bad the project fell through. Luckily I changed course in time. Holiday resorts... that's the future trend. It will definitely make a fortune. And when will that happen? Instantly! We're opening next month. Don't worry. As soon as we open for business, I'll wire you the money. How's that sound? I've got collectors at my doorstep every single day. I can barely go back home. How much do you have now? Just give me whatever you have left to help me out of this jam first. Alright, how about this. I still have a few loans to collect. I will drop Cheng a message, let him take you to collect them, so you can buy yourself some time. Alright? Fine. Don't lag behind anymore. Rest assured. It's not like we never made money together, am I right? Look at this place. It's a goldmine. It's just pocket change that you're fretting over. Relax. Don't be so nervous. Here. What do you expect? They're at my door everyday. I'm pregnant. Seriously? Let's stop calling each other from now on. Why so quiet? Are you upset? I need to hang up for a second. Got to pay this parking fee. Drive safely. Are you driving to the suburbs later? You scared me. I was just taking a nap. Scaredy-cat. No, I'm not driving. They'll come to pick me up later. I have trouble starting the car lately. You should get it fixed. Yes, ma'am. There're people here. Do old countryfolk really do yoga? Why do I find that hard to believe? The yoga studio is not doing well, so I take side jobs. I need some extra cash, too. Don't worry. Some money will come in soon. I'll take care of you. You? Fix the collateral on our apartment first. My parents are driving me mad. We should do it here for once when no one's around. What do you say? Nice try. We have to talk tonight. Not now? Dad, mom. Yang Hua. You're such a big shot these days! Don't say that, mom. I've been busy hustling. Hustle? You can't even keep the apartment. - Where's Miao Wei? - She's resting inside. Have a seat. I must go. I heard that compensation for your Dinosaur Park has been approved. Use your brains. Get a grip on your business. I know. Your creditors asked me to pay off your debts. I'm here to tell you, clean up your own mess. Listen up! We bought Miao a place when she was single. It's not yours to mortgage. You hear me? How did you come to know Mr. Luo? He went to my husband's high school. What's up? He said that these elderly people could perform at his resort. They were so thrilled, but afraid they couldn't do it well, so they always went to rehearse near the resort. Luo Yu sure doesn't take the easy way. A businessman with real capabilities. All those old people who know music have come together because of him. He pays them, too. That's a good man right there. Everyone, stop for a second! Ms. Miao is very satisfied with our progress. Why don't we let her show us some moves? - What do you all think? - Yes! We have some swings in the trunk. I can go get them. - Hello? - Mr.Yang. This debtor we are meeting tonight, l've asked her to contact you on WeChat. It's about time. OK, I see. In a minute. Tired? I'm fine. It was just a bit windy. Bad mood? No. I need to make a quick run. I will come back later. What for? Some errands with Luo Yu. I haven't washed my face. So what? I'm eating. Just trust me, babe. Don't touch me. He's a shareholder, too. One of the bosses. If you can please him, they will make it easier for you. There's no other way? Either this or you pay up. Do you have the money? You signed the loan contract, so if you can't pay back, we have to go by the contract. - You sure about this? - Of course I do. I care about you, sweetheart. Make me proud! Hello mister, my name is Wei Wei. You can call me Wei Wei. You brought the money? I'm still working on it. Give me a few more days, would you? I mean, it's not like you need this small cash. What are you doing? How much do you have on you? - Two hundred. - What? Two hundred? Do I look like a fool? Do you know how much you owe? Call your family. No, mister. - Please don't call them. - Stop bullshitting me. Give them a call. - Mister. - Now. I beg you. Please don't call my parents. I will do whatever you want. I mean it. What does that mean? Keep your clothes on. You're going to fucking whore out? If you knew it'd be like this, why did you borrow in the first place? I just wanted to buy a new phone. Just for a phone? My dorm mates looked down on me because I didn't use an iPhone. I was made a laughing stock. Served you right. I only borrowed 5,000RMB in the beginning. I didn't know it'd pile up. They kept lending me more. So it just snowballed. I don't know what to do now. Stop crying. Mister, I'm begging you. For the record, you didn't take my offer. Promise you won't send the photos to my family. Please? Put your clothes on. Put them back on. Get out of the car. Why so quiet? Are you upset? I need to hang up for a second. Got to pay this parking fee. When we met at our class reunion last time I realized how important you still are to me. I've never forgotten about us. I've been meaning to tell you something for decades. I've always wished that when you've grown old, lying on your deathbed, I'd be sitting beside you, telling you that throughout my life I've only had you in my heart. Then I'd watch a tear roll down your face before you leave this world. I would have told you this when we meet again. Today I can no longer hold back. Miao Wei, I don't want to hear this ever again. What happened, sir? If you won't do her, I will. - Don't waste it. - Go to hell! Look what you did! Let's go someplace warm. Let's go! Now you're embarassed? You didn't please him, so you might as well please me. Come on, let's go. I'll carry your bag. Have you told Yang Hua about the baby? Can't you give me a break? I will tell him when the time comes. Shouldn't you talk it over? I know. We'll see whether to keep the baby. Neither of us has the money to raise a child. He's a good-for-nothing. Gave up a decent job, and for what? The least he can do is be there for you. Yeah yeah. You've said enough. Worst case scenario, get a divorce. We can help you raise the baby. Mom. Stop slagging him off. Can't you just wish us to be happy? All you talk about is divorce or money. Money isn't everything. Welcome home. Hey there, Mr. Yang. Hey sir, we are going to sleep here tonight. If the management or residents ask questions we'd have to tell them the truth. I talked this over with Mr Wang on the phone. I'll pay in two days. Go home now. - Mr. Yang, I'm just thinking... - Will you just go back? For your own good, I suggest you get a tent and sleeping bag too. In case you get evicted, you'd at least have some shelter, right? Mister, look, it's so cold outside. Won't you invite us in for a while? Is your wife at home? Can she cook us some noodles? I've already told you. I'll pay off the debt in two days. - Otherwise, do as you please. - You better keep you word. Look at my arm rotting away from AIDS. I've still got to treat myself, right? - Mister, you... - Don't touch me. Mister, don't leave. I will go with you upstairs. - Get out, you hear me? - I will go up with you. - Get out! - What's wrong, sir? I'll kill you if you come in. - Don't go, mister! - Come on, mister! Keep out, you hear me? Out! Yes, I know. You take care of yourself. Take time off from the yoga studio. Don't worry so much. Cut down on the lessons. Don't practise anything too vigorous. You're home. Yang Hua's home. Don't forget what I said. Okay, I've got to go. I'm hanging up. What's this? Cheng, you son of a bitch. What are you staring at me for? So this is what you've been up to. I've always wished that when you've grown old, lying on your deathbed... Why did you stop listening? Who is that? I'm asking you. Who is it? Nobody. What about you? What're you talking about? Who is this woman on your phone? She has nothing to do with me. Nothing to do with you? Nothing to do with you? She wants you to get it on again. Let me just show you. - See here... I don't want to see. - Shut up and look carefully. - Look at what? - Look at this. Luo Yu sent me all this. I was only collecting debts for him. - Understand? - Show me the money then. Did you get it back? This is what you got back? Then what about you? - Why don't you finish listening to it? - Don't start bullshitting me. Just finish listening. What's going on here? What's going on with you? - You've got the nerve to turn on me. - Don't you put it on me, either. - I'm asking you who is this guy? - Why can't I put it on you? I already told you. I was only collecting debts. Nothing else. I didn't do anything. I'm telling you, you're exactly the sort who'd do such a thing. Don't you... Only people with your upbringing would stoop so low as to sponge off my family and spend it on whores! What's wrong with my upbringing? What did my family do to you? Don't you act like you don't know what's wrong with your family. Stop blaming this on my family. I'm asking you who is this? - You're shameless! - Tell that to yourself. Didn't you tell me that you've stopped seeing him? You said you broke off all contacts. What the hell is this? You've got the nerve. I'm talking to you about this. Stop turning this back on me! Just tell me who is this man! And what were you two doing? Did he shag you? - You useless piece of crap. - All you can do is yell at me. - Did he shag you? - You tell me! You did, didn't you? You slut. So it's over, huh? You made me. You leave me no choice. I tried to have a life with you, but you make it so difficult. Perfect! Let me tell you, I've had enough, too. After you got us into this shit, I can't even face my own parents. - It's always about your parents. - My mom's been right about this. You married me for our money. To hell with her! I never gave a shit about your money. Have I spent any of it? Haven't you? When did I use your family's money? What about this apartment dad bought? The cigarettes you smoke, the booze you drink, the fancy gifts for business networking, aren't they all from my dad? What else hasn't he foot the bill for? Did I ask for them? Did I? Did I ever ask them for money? Stop dragging your parents into this. Your whole family are snobs. All you care about is money! When I made money, didn't you spend it, too? You're going to hit me now? - Keep off. - Go ahead, hit me! Hands off! - Don't push me. - Do it then. - I dare you. - Don't push it. Just do it! Don't push me over the edge. I've had enough, too! Don't make me smash up our place. Smash it! Think I wouldn't dare? Think I wouldn't dare? Think I wouldn't dare? Fuck off! Fuck off! Get out! - Out! - Don't you regret this. - Out! - I'll never set foot here again. - Don't you ever come back! - I don't ever want to see you again! I never want to see your fucking parents. - What're you looking at? - What's your problem? Do you fucking know how to drive? And you do? You fucking idiot. - What did you just call me? - You idiot. - Stop it. - Go to hell! Fuck you, you fucking idiot! You try and call me that again! Come on. That's enough. You're insane. Can't go up this way? This way's blocked. Testing for tomorrow's light show. Go that way. That goes up the mountain, too. Hurry up! Any other passengers? The next ride won't come till half an hour later! The wind is so strong. Are you alright? Here, film me. Ouch, I think I got a side stitch. Isn't that the lighter I gave you? It's not too precious to use now? Let them be tokens of this special moment. Miao Wei, will you marry me? I will take good care of you. Here, hold it. What do you say? Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you I love you. We'll come back on this day For every year of our lives together. It's so beautiful. Miao Wei, I love you! I love you! Who do you love? I love you, Yang Hua! Genghis Khan is watching us! We are getting married! Holy shit! What a tough woman! This mother is a life-giver. A life-giver indeed. Life is such a miracle. OK. Let us begin our class. Our lesson today is on breathing, a fundamental element of yoga practice. We start with abdominal respiration. Everyone, slowly close you eyes. Think of your stomach as a ball, and keep your chest flat. Although we are breathing everyday, we usually don't focus our mind on it. To breathe consciously would help us control the rhythm of our breaths and supplement our bodies with more energy. Keep on practicing. Hello? Hello? - What time does your class finish? - I'm giving a trial lesson till noon. Dad and I are bringing you two free-range hens. I can't just go off like this. Give Yang Hua a call. Did you break the news about the baby? Can you stop asking? I will let him know when it's time. I'll tell him tomorrow, okay? I'm busy. Got to go. Why aren't you answering my calls? It's your birthday tomorrow. I just wanted to tell you, happy birthday. Hello? Is this Mr. Yang Hua? What is it? It's Sansheng Insurance calling. I'm in a meeting. I just need two minutes of your time. The complimentary accident insurance for you and your wife Miao Wei came into effect two years ago, when you were purchasing your car. I'm in a meeting now. The policy is about to expire. Just one more minute. We can directly deduct the renewal fee from your bank account. This is a reminder to make sure there are enough funds for withdrawal to avoid losing your coverage. Don't eat that. I will cook you some noodles. This is good enough. How's that Dinosaur Park of yours? When will it open? I'll take your mom and Dan-dan there for a visit. It's on a hold for now. We'll see in the future. You've lost weight from what I see. Don't risk your health for your career. Wang Erzi next door, same age as you, just had his second child. So what? You've been married for almost three years. Still not a bun in the oven. Give us a grandkid soon, or else we will be too old to raise it. Dan-dan! - You're home! - Uncle, uncle! - Did you miss your uncle? - Yes. How much did you miss him? When will you take me to the Dinosaur Park? That park's no fun. Don't bother your uncle. Come down. Look, this gun is a lot of fun! The theater we attended as kids will be demolished. What happened to your hand? Nothing. I tripped myself. Got any spare cash? Why? Dan-dan got into the advanced art class. It costs 5,000 RMB. Can you lend me the money? I'll return it when I get my paycheck next month. Uncle, uncle! Pay your debt,Yang Hua. Hello? Yang Hua, are you trying to kill me? What are you talking about? So I didn't get it on with you guys, and now you try to get back at me? I'm telling you, Delete my photos from the web at once. If my family sees them, I'm going to kill myself! Sorry, the number you dialed cannot be connected. Please dial again later. Sorry, the number you dialed cannot be connected. You assholes! Cheng turned off his phone on purpose, didn't he? And you still pretend like you don't know. I already made out with you two yesterday. - What else do you want from me? - I didn't upload those photos. - I have nothing to do with this. - Bullshit! You didn't upload... Don't touch me! Please calm down. You say you didn't upload them, huh? I already made out with you two yesterday. - What else do you want from me? - I'll take you to find Cheng. Hands off me! You just want me to die, right? I'm telling you... What are you doing? Don't touch me! Get out of the way. I'm telling you... If you touch me again, I will die right in front of you. What are you doing? Don't move. You really don't want to live, huh? - Don't move. - Let go of me. Stop it! Just let me die. Get over here! If you move again, I'll let go. Just let me die! Don't move! I want to die! You're crazy. I won't go to the hospital. - Open the door. - No, I won't go to the hospital. - Get out! - I won't go. Get out of the car and go to the hospital! You get yourself in there! Clinic Come on, everyone! Bottoms up? Cheers! To our new thriving business! As our client, feel free to come over whenever you want. Cheng, come here! - What's up? - What's up?! You son of a bitch! Why did you put her photos on the internet? Let go of me! What're you doing? She cut her wrist in front of me. She did? That's impossible. Where is she now? I just sent her to the hospital. Her dormmates told me that she died on the road across the hospital. Mr. Luo. Does this have anything to do with you? - Of course not. - I just followed the playbook. - Has anyone linked it to us? - No. - I only uploaded some photos. - Keep an eye on it. What's... Hurry! Go! You utter scum! You killed her! I killed her? What good is her death to me? She killed herself. It has nothing to do with us. How did this happen? What do we do now? Buddy, this has nothing to do with you. I will take care of it. You make it sound so easy. How are you going to do that? I already told you, I'm going to take care of it. You just go on home. Go. You're fucking killing me, too! I can't go back home, you understand? When will I get my money back? When will I get my money back? I'll go get it now. You want money, huh? Here it is. Don't treat me like a begger! Luo Yu, don't forget how much I helped you when you were broke. Now you go rogue on me? God damn you! Come on! Let Mr. Luo make a toast. We were just looking for you. Come on, let's continue. Why are you sitting down? Let's drink! Come on! Yang Hua, what kind of a man are you? The debtors won't let me step outside. Wipe your own ass before you leave. You've pawned away our home, now you've buggered off, leaving me to clean up. What kind of a shitty man would do such a thing? - What's up? - Come and say hi to uncle. Uncle! Yang Hua, your friend's come for a visit and brought us a watermelon. Your sister's here with Dan-dan. Dan-dan is a cute kid, Mr. Yang! You scared me. Where's he? Your friend left. Have some melon. It's real sweet. What's going on with you? Luo Yu, I need the money today. - They're coming for me. - Stop nagging. - Didn't I just tell you yesterday... - Don't you freaking lie to me! You pocketed the compensation for Dinosaur Park. Who made this up? - You don't trust me anymore? - You heard me. I want my money back today. Alright, I need to go. I'm swamped. Talk to you later. The hell you are! Did you hear what I said? Cough it up today. Ready, go! I call zero! Seven! Five! - Your turn to drink. - It's your liquor. Bottoms up! Oh my! What's going on here? What happened? Get Mr. Luo, quick! - What's all this? - See it for yourself. How dare you! Don't move! What's this? Let go of him! Boss, he set fire to one of our yurts. Luckily we caught it in time. If we got there any later, the resort would have burnt to ashes. Oh buddy, what did you do that for? Have I not treated you well enough? If you torched the whole place, it'd be game over for me. We're even now. I don't owe you anything anymore. Get the fuck out of here! Boss, I've stationed men to keep watch there Play a nice number for our VIPs. Hey my man. Sir, sir. My apologies. A friend of mine came. Come on. Cheers everyone! Come on, a toast to everyone! Always look out for us. We've got your back. - Drop by anytime. - Sure. Make yourself at home. Thanks. Here's to everyone! - Sit, sit. - This is good liquor. More wine, Mr. Luo. Nice view around here. - How do you like it here? - It's not bad. Top up the Secretary's glass. How's the food? - Pretty comfortable. Great, great. - Come on. Let's drink to our Secretary again. To your health. And to Mr. Li. - Cheers! - Okay. To our great Secretary. Yeah. See how much effort we've put in. I want to make this into something bigger. We start with a few yurts, then put up more, grow it into an enterprise. - How does that sound? - It's already pretty good now. We're still young. We'll work hard. Please support us. - Make good use of this place. - Yes, yes. I have ideas on how to expand the business. Watch out! Fire! It's on fire! Hurry! Go get help! Quick! Get the buckets! Cheng! Cheng! Here! Here! Over here! Over here! Quick! Put out the fire! Cheng! Cheng! Get the buckets from the back! Here's water! Get your water here! Hurry! Hurry! You guys, quick! Get the big buckets! Hurry! - Put it out! - Splash it in the back! Cheng, go to the back! Tell them to go to the back. I want to report a crime. The girl who committed suicide in front of the City Hospital this morning... I know who made her do it. We made a good couple in college. I did have feelings for you. But so many years have passed, and we haven't met up for so long. Now I'm carrying my husband's child. So don't text me anymore. Just stay out of my life. Delete contact Yang Hua, you haven't been answering your phone for days. What have you been up to? Why are you still out so late? You should stay at home and help out, instead of being all over the place. Do you know that Miao Wei's pregnant? Whatever business you're doing out there, to us, it's chicken feed. Your priority now is to go home and take good care of Miao Wei, got it? Today is our wedding anniversary. I'll pick you up at home later. Let's go up the mountain. I've fallen out completely with Luo Yu. I torched his Desert Moon resort. The police already took him away. My share of investment is lost forever. It's not just the apartment, I mortgaged the car, too. I've reached the end of the road. How come you never told me anything? You didn't talk this through with me. I never thought it'd come to this. Who knew they were all assholes? Now what? Are you going to leave me? With how things are now, what kind of a life can we have? Can your dad give me some help? My dad? Help you? Hasn't he helped you enough? Aren't you embarrassed to ask him? Even I feel embarrassed on your behalf. I can't even bring up your name to them. You don't get it, do you? For the sake of our family, I wanted to make more money. I just didn't expect things to end up like this. You had a decent job before, but you had to give that up to try your hand at business. Are you cut out for it? Now you've screwed up, are you satisfied? Got what you wanted? What else can I do? I can't help you. Let's just get a divorce. How can you just walk away? You've torn our home apart. I have nothing left to hang on to. Who gets custody of our child? How did you find out? What have you got to hide? Why didn't you tell me? I have nothing to hide. There's no use telling you. It's not like you can raise the baby. Then tell me who the fuck can. Who do you want to raise it with? What do you mean? What do you think I mean? I don't know what you're talking about. You better tell me what you meant by that. If it's my kid, why didn't you tell me? Feel guilty, huh? Me? Guilty? Are you insane? You fucking animal! Come back! Tell me straight up. Whose kid is this? You're out of your fucking mind! Tell me! Whose is it? Not yours! Not yours! Not yours! You worthless loser. It's not yours! Fuck you, Yang Hua! Now you don't fucking pick up your phone? Where's the money you promised to give yesterday? How much do you want? l have it. You just wait. You called the police, yes? Yes. What happened to her? She fell down from up here. She fell? Do you know her? She's my wife. Your wife? How did she fall exactly? Can you describe it to me? Pulse resumes. Spontaneous breathing detected. Blood oxygen 80, heart rate 120. Carry her away! Careful! Excuse me, doctor, can you tell me how is her condition now? Her vital signs have stablized. We have to go to the hospital now for further examination. Okay, got it. Please go. Sir, listen. There are some procedures that will require your cooperation. We need to make further inquiries. - Can you come with us? - Yes, let's go. - Hey, Jin Hao. - Yes, sir. - Drive that Q5 back to the squad. - Yes, sir. Alright, let's go.
