IT'S NOT ORANGES- IT'S HORSES Hello... hello! Young man, are you a painter? Yes, are you interested? It's my last. No, I need to have the ceiling whitewashed. Is that not for you? It's impossible to get a craftsman. - Here you go. - Thanks. I'm afraid you'll lose again, mate. I probably do that. I'm a born loser. - What are you doing anyway? - I'm a sculptor. - Is it worth it? - No. Why don't you chop something else? If it doesn't pay to cut pictures, then cut radios? You misunderstand. I am a real sculptor with a hammer and chisel, like Thorvaldsen, you know. Are you an artist? So don't want to sit here with you. I have nothing against thieves, whores or capitalists - - but to play with an artist, that's where I set the limit. - Did you hear that? - Yes! Is there anything to say about that? - What do you mean? - They are a parasite on society. The whore or thief risks getting caught. The capitalist risks a life for fraud. What do you risk? I can't follow you... Every Danish taxpayer pays 3 hours a year to the State's Art fund. What do we get for that money... Art? No, shit in curry! I receive no money from the Art Foundation. What do I care! It is a question of principles. A modern society does not need art. We need production and tax reduction. If you speak against me, you will get a pair on the coat! It is below my level to talk more with you. Good day. My name is Richard Hansen. - Aah, good day. - I have assumed a picture. - May I see how it hangs? - Yes, they hang out in here. What the Satan in Hell is the point of that?! - Where is my picture? - They both hang there. That's the packaging. It is a cardboard box lids. The exhibition committee is otherwise enthusiastic. They think that the everyday realism in the background is epoch-making. I have to give them epoch-making! When the committee says it's art, then it's art, - - they have sense about it. They ruin the exhibition! I'm going to hell with the exhibition committee! - (there is a knock on the door) - Come on, Mr. Mortensen. Magnum... I wonder where they have done with the rest? Mortensen, really I should be furious. No, little lady, it is I, who have reason to be furious. They buy luxury goods in cash everywhere but from me. - They don't have any luxury goods! - Then I have a bill for you. - God, 367 crowns... - Yes, and it is 3 months old. And then there's the rent, if that doesn't bother you purely artistic - - to talk about something as ordinary as money. - The rent is not yet. - No, that was 14 days ago. - What are we going to do then? - We put you on the street. If you have not paid by tomorrow at 12. Shame for you. Why don't you paint something proper instead of oranges? It's not oranges. It's horses. Any idiot can tell it's oranges. Maybe for an idiot. For others it is horses. Then it's horse pairs! Anyway, it's some shit. What was it?! Did you say idiot? That's not how you talk to a creditor, little lady. That's not how you talk to a host. Especially me! Is the rent not paid by tomorrow at 12, then it's out! (there's a knock on the door) - What's up now, Mortensen? - (there is a knock on the door) Sorry. I thought it was a bill. Does a painter Richard Hansen live here? - He is not at home. - When you live here, then you can sign off. Is it necessary? He will probably have to appear in the district court again. Goodbye. What happened? It's like people don't like us. - As soon as they hear we're Artists, we get the cold shoulder. - It's the Art Foundation, you. Yes, and the culture-pit. and whatever that crap is called. - When people hear the word art, they feel cheated... _ They usually are. Whoa, whoa, what's that, Hansen!? Now it's rent by tomorrow at 12. Otherwise, it's out. - What was that, Mortensen? - Mind your own business. Hey. (The door opens) Talentless amateurs! - Do you mean us? - Yes, you too. All people in the entire world. - How are they treating us! - Something happened? Who kicked you? I have accepted 2 photos at Charlottenborg. - What do you have?! - Congratulations, you old man! - It's gorgeous! - No! I have only submitted one. What do you mean by that? I had packed it in two layers of cardboard boxes. They have assumed them. And discarded my picture. - It's very funny! - God it isn't! It's a disaster. I had just bought brandy wine. I thought we were going to have a party. Do any of you have any money? Well, no. How will I get something to eat then? - Our Lord softens the air... - No, but I will. How about clearing the table? You could at least empty the ashtray. I was a model in a porn series. It brings money. - A glass is missing. - Drink from the sugar bowl. We put it here. Then we know where we have it. In case anyone wants a sugar cube... (music) Thorvaldsen must sit at the end of the table. Thorvaldsen must sit well. He needs a little pillow in the back... a little pillow in the bottom. Then Thorvaldsen sits well. Do you want a small one? We might as well be friends. You will experience good outdoors and swimming. Now I have it! - You have to clean up! - It can't be of any use. Here it will look exactly the same again. We can at least throw away the prosecutor's letters. None of us read them. Bills, bills. Reminder letters, solicitor's letters... Keep track of what people throw out for postage. No, it's for me. Bills... oops, what kind of letter is that? It is a registered letter to Richard. I signed for it. Holy shit. It is from the State's Art Foundation. - It's a refusal. Away! - They don't write when it's a refusal. They didn't write when I got rejected. No, to you! I had to call in there myself and ask. How stupid you are. Give it to me. Yes, it's a rejection. Definitely. ''Mr. painter Richard Hansen. l petition of 19.4. -'' " - have you applied for a grant of DKK 20,000..." "... younger artists... The amount cannot be granted." It is well done. No motivation. Just a no. To one of the country's most talented painters. - Yes, they also said no to you. - And also to me. - Why? - It's quite straightforward. Your art is abstract, absurd, modernist and incomprehensible. But it is not incomprehensible enough. I am not a social democrat, belong to no clan or clique - - or sits on some political or artistic council you can exploit. You only have one thing, and that is talent. They only become famous when they are dead. But then it will be too. We can only live on it when we are dead. - What did I say? - You said... Oops, something's not right. We can only live on it when we are dead. We can only live off it if one of you is dead. Who will be famous first? Can't you see; If one of you commits suicide, then we are lucky! She is right. If you killed yourself, - - then the rest of us could make a memorial exhibition. - Then you are famous. - Then sell all your pictures and get money. And then we get calm to do something properly. Why should I kill myself? It could be you too. No, I'm not that vain, I can wait for fame. Yes, but I don't want to. I thought you were a friend otherwise. Sitting here wishing I was dead? - No, it wasn't meant to be. - Yeah... Shall we play about it? - About what? - About which of you will die. - Yes... I'm on that one. - Zero. I always lose in games. Well, you do too. - Shall I guess for you? - No, I'd better do it myself, alright. A moment... Who is starting? - I'm sitting in the back. - Why? Before you wanted to kill me. I must have a chance now. Okay. You're laying out, Max. There are 9. There is... bare ass. You are so stupid that it pisses you off. One cannot be known to guess. You have full house... it's 3. You have bare ass. There are 6. I have 2 with me. - Then I'm out of it. - Okay. There are... 4. There are 6. What did I say? I always lose. - It's you. - You can easily say that. It was a really bad idea. It was no idea at all. - Why? - Max is a sculptor. What does it help him to be famous? We can't live off that. People don't want to buy statues. And not his at all. Completely true. It's wrong, it's going to be me. I've always thought so. So what? - Then it must be you. - Why? I won after all. So it can't be me. Excellent... excellent. Fine. (a bang) No, now it must stop! Out with you! No, now it must stop! Out with you! No, now it must stop. Can you come out! This has to stop. Out... away with you. That's it! - Steffen, wait until tomorrow. - Don't do anything rash. Don't take it so literally. That someone can go so crazy from drinking liquor. - I think he means it. - No, wait until he sobers up. (a bump) Stop that nonsense! Now you've tried it. - Come and get a little one. - Take gas, it won't dust. - Have you gone insane everyone?! - Now let him take gas. No!... Steffen! Farewell, you old man. Be well. There is no reason to be tactless. - We can't just let him die! - An agreement is an agreement. You can save yourself on that. - Why? - The gas was closed this morning. We haven't paid the bill. I'll have to come up with something. - Good luck. - No, Steffen... What will you do if he succeeds? Steffen! Steffen! An agreement is an agreement. One have to stick to it. Steffen! Steffen! Steffen! ... Steffen! Steffen! Why do you want to save me when you can't even swim? - Whoa, you wanted to save me! - No. Why did you jump in? - Why did you jump in? - Why did you jump in? - Because I wanted to drown. - I who thought you were a hero. Well, would you also drown yourself? - Yes. - Then let's drown together. - No, you can't do that. - Why not? We hardly know each other. (a doer gets up) Well...I thought you were dead. It's not that easy to kill yourself, just so you know. - Where did you pick her up? - ln the channel. Can't you get night piece and quiet. She also tried to kill herself. Can't you get her some nice clothes? (bump) Thanks. - May I ride along? - Where are you going? - Away. On North. - Okay. Just jump in. - Do you want to come up and have coffee? - No, thanks. I want to stay here. - Do you have a piece of paper? - Yes, in the glove compartment. - Where is Richard? - Richard? I didn't know that. - He ran after Steffen last night. - Oh, yes. Shouldn't you have committed suicide last night? What became of it? 14 hours ago. Should you keep putting it off? - I'm thinking hard about it... - Are you backing out? No, no, but what about postponing it? Just a few days. I'd rather get a lot out of it, right? If I paint a lot of sketches... Something reminiscent of my streak, so… So what? So there are more pictures after my death, right? It's for your own sake. I think we should postpone it. God, what does this look like! - Who is it? - Yes, what is your name? - Else lversen. - We will kill ourselves together. That's why I wanted a postponement. We want to get to know each other better first. Where would such a cool girl kill herself? She has it all. Soup, fish, roast and cake. Everything a sculptor needs... artistically. - You can't make a living being pretty. - You have. (there's a knock on the door) - Why don't you open up? - Shhh. - I thought it was a bill. - Might be. Ms. Louise Moerck. Does she live here? - It is me. - A registered letter. - Say you didn't see me. Probably uncomfortable. - Please acknowledge. - Good weather. - Thanks. It's from Sweden. Do we have any creditors in Sweden? Nah, not what I know. - It's from Richard. - Why is he writing to you? We shall have none of that. " Dear survivors. What happened last night was so desperate, -" " - so it was not worth bearing. I saw it myself." "The best always die a senseless death." " We'll never see each other again. Goodbye. Kind regards, Richard." (crying) - What's wrong? - It is sad when someone kills themselves. Was he young? Who? Him Richard. That can't be right. Well, now that he's done it... ... then I don't need to. He left behind a lot of pictures. How disgusting you all are! Are none of you grieving? Yes... of course we grieve. He was... he was... He was a good painter. He was a good painter. Aah, inspectors. Where are Hansen's pictures? - Who? - Isn't that the two pieces of paper? No, there has been a misunderstanding. They have been... removed. - Stolen? Were they pornographic? - No, how can you believe that about us! - Has the censor removed them? - Of course not. As soon as we accepted one we stick to it. Where are they? Don't like saying, but Richard Hansen has removed them himself. He was drunk and mad, - - ripped them off the wall and called us idiots. Where does he live? What do you do when people die? Isn't there something to report it? Yes... I'll go down and put in an obituary. - Don't you want to come? - No. I will stay here and cherish the memory of the dead. Hey. Editor Abel Spandabel, Ekstra Gazette. Do I meet the painter Richard Hansen? - No. - When will he be home? It's about the two pictures he has accepted at Charlottenborg. No, he has assumed two cardboard box layers. Has the exhibition committee adopted the packaging? - Yes, exactly! - Ha-ha, it's really funny. - Think so? Richard doesn't think so. - You can get a smacking on the cupboard. - Respect for the dead! - Death? What should that mean? Richard killed himself last night. Holy shit. What a story. The exhibition committee humiliated an artist, so he killed himself. We adopted the two pictures because we found them talented. Two cardboard box layers. How would you explain it? He was such a great talent that his subconscious, - - even when he dried his brushes on cardboard, became works of art. That's what you say, as chairman of the referee committee. Yes. Then Richard Hansen must have been a genius. He was that. - And those are horses too? - Yes. Hell yeah. It is not of the same person. Well... no, it's mine. But it is. Yes, there is no doubt that he has talent. A lot of talent. But does it last? I mean… after the sensation wears off. Hello. Hello. Well... he doesn't hang in our museums or art collections. Saw any actual prices on him, I don't think so... He was a great artist and a wonderful person. - Who is... - Deceased's fiancee. His pictures are not to be sold. That would be to desecrate his art. You must get a small one, since it is yours for 5,000. Hurry before I change my mind. So I wanted to have the little one over in the corner with the horses. - Who should I write the check to? - Me. To Ms. Else lversen. - Here you go. - Thanks. I hope I can buy some of his pictures later. I hardly think so. Let me see that check! It is good enough. You're a bit of a contender. If you hadn't said you were his fiancee... I was his fiancee. We had planned to die together. But he beat me to the punch. No, we decided that one of us would die. - It wasn't Richard. - It was me! - We decided we wanted to kill us together. - You didn't know Richard. I did not?! Richard and I have lived together for the past 3 years. We have all lived together. Richard was not engaged. On the contrary. He was banging all over town. That's what I'm saying. You didn't know Richard. You can scam an art dealer. But not us. - If you run with the money... - Money doesn't interest me. You can have have them. I want to make Richard famous. It is my duty to the memory of my beloved. I want to be interviewed for the newspapers. I want to tell the public what he was really like. What was he really like? How he was as an artist, posterity must judge. What he was like as a person belongs to privacy. I will never get over the loss of this unique person. Has it not enriched your life to know such a great artist? Yes. - May I ask a single question? - Gladly. Isn't it difficult to get rid of all Richard Hansen's pictures? Yes, but I feel it is my duty for his memory. His art must hang so it can reach out - - to the general population that he loved. When has he loved the general population? None of us knew Richard. She is the only one who knew what he was really like. - I really think they were engaged. - I think so as well. What does she get out of it? She hands over all the money to us. It was good that it was Richard who died. We wouldn't have gotten nearly as much out of it if it was Steffen. You don't have to be sure of that. (a thunderclap) Do you have any fire? Damn what they keep writing about Richard. It has been 1 year since he died. They haven't written a single line about us! - Yes, about Else. - (doer bell) Here you go. You... What do we do when we've sold all of Richard's pictures? - I didn't know. - There will soon be no more left. Why hasn't he painted more! He could have done that. Should we see to get going? No, I'll stay home. I think I'll do some work today. (doer bell) It was about time. Thanks. - You... What do you think? - Yeah... Oh yeah, it's still really excellent. - It's no Richard Hansen. - No, it's not. I'm as good as he was! Just because I'm not dead... That's your own fault. You had the chance. We are late for it. The exhibition opens at 2 p.m. Since there are so few pictures left, shouldn't we raise the price? (he plays) (a thunderclap) What the hell! (a loud clap of thunder) Steffen! Richard, god damn! Where have you been? - Don't you have any food? - Yeah. What does it look like here? What happened? What do you want? - A beef, a little cold duck... - Aah, fillet of beef. (cuts with an electric knife) - Have you won the lottery? - No, why? - Don't you also have a Beer? - Yeah. - And brandy wine. - Yes... Ah yes, it was nice. I haven't had anything decent to eat for the last 14 days. - I thought you were dead. - What? Why should I be dead? I thought you were dead. - Where have you been? - In Sweden. All the way up north. Below the Arctic Circle. So... So... has it been a long time since you read Danish newspapers? I have not seen either Swedish or Danish newspapers in I don't know how long. You... I know, I tighten it. It looks to be going well. But can't you lend me 100 crowns? Yes. Can you give again on a 500 note? 100 Swedes, that is. It even 134 Danes. You can just take them. - Then I can release my pictures. - Your pictures? I had to pawn my pictures. Otherwise I would never have come home. Were there... are there many? Yes, 26-27 pieces. Everything I've done up there. Have you pawned them for DKK 100? Yes, Swedish that is. What's wrong? Are you sick? 27 pictures for DKK 100. You could also get that for your pictures, I'm sure of it. - Have you signed them? - What? - Have you signed them? - Yes. Why? - With your full name? - Yes, I usually do that. - Where did you pawn them? - At a grocery store in Ostersund. - What's his name? - I have the loan note. Why do you care? You're sure he's not selling them, right? No danger of that, no one in Ostersund wants to buy a picture of me! He must have had it as an obsession to paint oranges. - There are oranges in all the pictures. - not oranges, it's horses. He bought the models down at my greengrocer's. - For him it became horses. - You have known the genius? A magnificent painter and a wonderful person. He often came to my place when he was misunderstood. I saw early on that he was a talent. You always said before that it was a hoax and a fraud. Shut up, bitch. It's my wife. You have sharp fever. Shouldn't I call a doctor? No! It will pass. Have you met anyone since you got home? Yes, Lauritzen, but he was shitty drunk as usual... What's up now? - Hey. - Good day. Why are you looking at me like that? - Are you not happy to see me at all? - Who is it? - You know... - Nah. You don't want to say you don't know Richard... ... Hansen's very best friend. I am pleased. My fiancé's friends are also my friends. - Your fiancé? - I was engaged to Richard Hansen. You didn't know that? You haven't forgotten that, as much as you... he spoke fondly of Else. (the phone is ringing) And then unexpectedly, you appear. It's TV-news. We meet Ms. Else lversen? Yes, just a moment. - It is for you. - Thanks. Yes, hello? ... Yes it is me. Now immediately? Yes, of course. I'll take a carriage, then I can be there in a quarter of an hour. Yes, goodbye. I have to go, but I hope to see you later. Then you must tell me about my fiancé. - What are you about to do? - interviewed for TV-news. They want the personal story of Richard. Now they have heard so much about the great painter Richard Hansen. Now they want to know something about man. See you later. - Don't get it. Who is that girl? - It was your fiancé! - I've never seen her before. - Deceased fiancee. You're dead. There is no time to waste. We got no time to waste. He must be washed, shaved and changed. In short: He must be made unrecognizable. - May I have an explanation then! - You get it while we do it. - Washing?! No! - Get him! He doesn't realize he's dead! Now stop running. (they scold) I hate you! - We'll probably get you shaved! - Stop with that nonsense. - Now be reasonable, Richard. - You just need a shave. - Where are the scissors? - In the kitchen. Are those scissors coming soon? I have it. - No, no! - Richard, now sit still. No, no, no! - How much does he know? - nothing. - He doesn't know, he's dead. - Impossible! He has lived in the wasteland for a whole year! If you show up alive, it's all ruined. Do you want to be dead and famous, or alive and infamous? - Ow ow ow! - So, so, so. Ow ow ow. (dance music) Tell us more about Richard. You speak so beautifully of him. The others do not speak nearly so well of him. - Don't they? - Just like they are envious. - Think how much they owe him. - Yes, you're right about that! A moment. just turn off the gramophone. Isn't it a good idea to stop for a moment- - and remembers our mutual friend, Richard. Do you remember him? I know you can. ... Can you, Max? Steffen? ... Louise? The great painter, the great man, the great... - Bread. - Max is a stupid pig, isn't he, Max? I don't think you realize how much you owe him. Your smart car. The booze you drink. He must live, he must live... Max has also always been tactless. Get up. Let's remember Richard together. Cheers, Richard, and thank you. If you know that word? How you must have loved Richard. Yeah, that's not the word at all. We will be good friends. We share a great feeling. Here. In Ostersund. 27 pictures... Can we do it? Yes, Richard can't, he's dead. You and I are going over there. Steffen has to make sure that Richard doesn't do stupid things. He must not leave the apartment. No one must see him. Something is not right... No, it's genuine enough, I picked it up from the bank myself. Exactly, but something is not right. You don't mean that you want to sell the pictures for 100 kroner, do you? They must also have interest, that is clear. But surely no more than he has borrowed? Do you mean you will pay DKK 100 for the pictures? - Yes. - Well, I have to though. Where do I have them? Don't you want something else instead? No, it's the pictures we're after. Yes, but then look in the pile of dung in the corner. - How many have l found now? - 6. Then only 21 are left. And there. - There. - Thanks. Yes, there should be 23 pictures down here. I have things in order. - How many have I found? - 23. - Yes, I said that. - Where are the last 4? I can't get them. I'll keep them. I get DKK 6 per pieces, so I don't think I'm being cheated. 6... i.e. DKK 20 again minus interest on the 100, it becomes... Nah, we won't have any of that. I shouldn't have more than DKK 20 for the four paintings? They are not for sale at all. Then come along. - Yes, there they are, and there. - Are you crazy, man! He has used a lot of oil paint on those paintings. Neither snow nor rain can penetrate. - This is how you treat art! - Art or no art. My roof has never been so roofed. " Painting genius Richard Hansen will never form a school." " The spontaneity that is in his colors -" " - the musicality, in his brushstrokes..." - I knew I was good, but didn't know I was that good! - You aren't. It's unfair competition... You could have let me croak. Then I was famous. You must be naive, Steffen. - Are you a better painter than me? - Read what the critics say. Paint a picture, don't write Richard Hansen and try to get it sold! Then you see... - Should we go? - Yes, we're gone. - We have such a good time! - We need some air. If we want to go for a walk, then we go for a walk. Then put them on. Your eyes can't stand the sun. - It's gray weather. - He can't stand that at all. I will come along. You don't mind, do you? It worries me that I am so happy. - It is wrong against Richard. - Richard would have understood. When I'm with you, it's like Richard disappears. No, he is closer to you than ever. So, now let's move on. Mr Mortensen. I would like some apples. Oranges, bananas, tomatoes, cucumber. Tell my wife. Tell my wife. Are you sure Richard killed himself? He wrote from Sweden. He can live very well. No, I, myself was present when he did it. - What were you?! - He both hung and shot himself, he wanted to be sure. It happened down by the river. - And you were there? - Yes. When he was dead, I threw him into the river and let him disappear. So what? Then I traveled to Copenhagen to drown myself in the canal. It was there that I met Steffen. Did you meet her in the water? Would she kill herself? - Not sure. At least she jumped in. - Then it's true. - Has she told something untrue? - That I hanged myself and shot myself. She threw me in a Swedish river. That's why you never found me. - What's this about? - She told me her father was a French general. And her mother movie star. She didn't say or deny Greta Garbo. I thought she was descended from the Czar of Russia. What kind of lady is that? She is full of lies. She never lies to gain something herself. - Don't you have a vivid imagination? - Is it that strange? I am related to the Swedish royal house, I was born where my mom died at childbirth. - And your father? - Lion's tamer from Turkey. I was adopted as an infant. I had a terrible childhood. - Sorry, but aren't you dead? - Am I dead? ... No. - Isn't that your friend Richard? - Richard is dead. - Arthur Borgesen. - Oh... Excuse the inconvenience. - You can't live here. - You meet someone who recognizes you! - And what about Else? - Yes... Else. You must disappear. Else is a pathological liar. - And you're dead. - And famous. Else is not a pathological liar. She just has imagination. She is a poet. He has really fallen in love with her. If it wasn't for her, you would never have become famous... not so quickly. You think my pictures are sold because I am dead. I'll show you something else. No, damn it. (a bang) No, now it must stop! I will be... Now it must stop! Hello. Hello. - What is the name? - Tage Soerensen. - Did you paint that picture? - Yes. - Fucking bad. - What? It is outstanding. It's not art. It is a bad copy of Richard Hansen. Can you tell the difference between a Richard Hansen and this? Yes, the talent. Richard Hansen would never paint dots on the horses. - What kind of horses? - The two horses there. It's not horses. It's oranges. It's two horses. If I wouldn't know, who would. They are two oranges that have fallen on a lawn. So what do the two black dots mean? The oranges are date-stamped. They are very good. You have forgotten the name of a couple. Just do it. - No. - Why not? Because I'm dead. If a man writes his name, it is fraud. - Not on your own photos. - It does not matter. Anyone can see it's Richard Hansen. - No, they can't. Trust me. - Do you mean it? - I knew it. - Then you must sign them. Come. If I got that much for writing my name, I didn't do anything else. Come on! Aahr, l never learns. - What is it, you're doing? - nothing. - What kind of pictures are these? - Some of Richard's survivors. We have found them in Sweden. - They are not painted by Richard. - That was the devil! Don't you think I know what he left behind? Don't you think I knew Richard's output? He had no secrets from me. Those pictures are a fake. - That's too strong! - Yes, that's too strong. There are no more images. So now you will make forgeries. You drags Richard's art down to a talentless level. - That's enough! - Yes! You caught red-handed. You signed those pictures. You who can't paint a brush stroke. I can't hold back any longer. Those pictures are painted by Richard! Don't lie. I hate lies. Richard painted those pictures. He's not dead! - Why did you paint his name on it? - Because I am Richard! Beloved... you live! Think, now we can go out into the sun and I can scream it out. " Here I go with my beloved, the famous painter Richard Hansen." " And he's not dead at all. He's spring alive." - He cannot come back to life. - Why not? - Then he is accused of fraud. - They think it was a PR number. A living Richard cannot sell pictures. - And what shall we live on? - You take a name change. - You continue to paint and become famous. - No, it won't work at all. Then I am a bad copy of myself. There is a third possibility. That the dead can continue to be dead. And that dying keeps painting. That the dead have left behind more pictures than we dreamed of! That the dead is marrying me. - We got some juicy horses. - Not horses, it's oranges. Aah, oranges. How are you? How far have you come now? To my experiences as a harem dancer in Egypt.
