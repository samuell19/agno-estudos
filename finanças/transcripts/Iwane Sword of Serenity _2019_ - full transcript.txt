SASAKI DOJO HEAD INSTRUCTOR SASAKI REIEN Stop! If you learn humility, you'll be adding wings to the tiger, Kinpei. Oh, you are too kind. It wasn't a complement. Shinnosuke, your personality is reflected in your swordplay as well. Meaning? I like that it's straightforward, but you lack imagination. Is imagination necessary for sword skill? SAKAZAKI IWANE See? This is exactly what he means. I heard that, Iwane. Come, Iwane, you're next. I'd like to decline. Are you scared? Come on, Iwane. Beat him up! I'm going to miss seeing these guys do this. Me too. It cannot be helped. They have big jobs waiting for them at their hometown. Right, Iori, you are from Sekimae too, aren't you? Yes. There it is. Iwane's fighting stance. is like an old cat taking a nap under the spring sun. It's almost like fighting a sleeping man whom you cannot hit. Stop! I wish you'd give me your best counterattack. Then I'd beat you in one attack. People call him "Inemuri" (Sleepy) Iwane, SWORD OF SERENITY (Inemuri Iwane) SEKIMAE, BUNGO The view of Sekimae hasn't changed a bit! Right, It's been three years. What are you doing? Why? We're almost home. Let's get moving. We'll be way busy once we get there. Let's enjoy our last break. I'm enjoying my last break before having to work in Sekimae. Ah, I miss Edo already! Stop fooling around. Let's go! What? What's with you? Kinpei, be patient with him. Shinnosuke can't wait to see his wife. You mean Mai? All right! Let me see! Doesn't it look good on her? Yes, it does. SHINNOSUKE'S WIFE KAWADE MAI Doesn't it? Yes. Ho! Is that so. Then you can bow to me and beg. What? Say "Please stand up. my big brother-in-law." Cut it out, Kinpei. Shinnosuke, he's just teasing you. He'll make you do it too starting tomorrow, Iwane. I know... I was just thinking about that too. I'm not looking forward to calling him my big brother. Iwane, did you buy Nao a souvenir? Yes. What did you get? It's none of your business. What did you just say? That's no way to speak to your big brother-in-law. Until my wedding tomorrow, you're just my childhood friend. Let's go. 3 YEARS AGO I'll be stationed in Edo for 3 years. Nao. KINPEI'S SISTER KOBAYASHI NAO Iwane-sama. I've known you since our childhood. But I won't get to see you for 3 years until you are 27. We will miss seeing the changing of the seasons together. I know. When I see you next time, you will be 19. Look. Nanten plant is about to bloom. In one month, white flowers will bloom. But those flowers will fall in summer. Then, it will start to bear fruits. Rain will fall on them in autumn. and when winter comes... Its fruits will turn red. Yes. It will have vibrant red fruits. Vibrant red... Vibrant red... I am looking forward to it. To see you in three years... when you will be stronger and more beautiful. I promise to love you only, and I will be waiting for you. We're so close to our homes! Finally! Home sweet home! I will see you guys tomorrow. See you. Ah Welcome home! Young master! It's been a while. Welcome home. Father, Mother, I have returned. CHIEF SAMURAI OF BUNGO SEKIMAE CLAN SAKAZAKI MASAYOSHI Iwane, I'm glad to have you back. I'm happy to see you two are doing well. Your wedding preparation is all done for you. Thank you. Big brother! Mind you manners. Oh Iyo! My, you've grown! Welcome back. I missed you. I'm glad to see you too. Iwane. starting tomorrow, you won't be a bachelor anymore. Next month, you'll start your job as a clan accountant. Your friend Shinnosuke is the head of his house. Kinpei also got a job serving the clan. I want three of you to turn our outdated clan around. Yes, sir. Father. I am marrying Iwane-sama tomorrow. Father, your son Kinpei is back! Big brother. I missed you, Nao! Iwane returned safely too. Mother, you look well. Come on, Nao, sit by me. Father, how are you? My, Edo is such an exciting place! Iwane and I received instructor's manuals from Sasaki Reien Sensei. Oh, I bought home this medicine from Edo. They say it prevents strokes. Boy, am I starving! Mother, can I have dinner? Sure, Get it ready. Is that you, Shinnosuke? Oh hello, Uncle. Did you just return from Edo? Yes, I just returned with Kinpei and Iwane. Good, I must tell you something. Come. I'm sorry but I have to go see my family first. It will be too late then. Too late for what? Not here. Come. SHINNOSUKE'S UNCLE KURAMOCHI JUZO It's about your wife, Mai. Mai is seeing a man. Huh? You must be joking, Uncle. This isn't a joke. This is foolish. Mai is not like that. Men say that about their women. There is this new place in Shumoku town where couples meet. Mai has been meeting with Yamajiri Yorisada there often. Yamajiri Yorisada? SQUAD LEADER YAMAJIRI SABUROSUKE'S SECOND SON YAMAJIRI YORISADA His father Yamajiri Saburosuke-sama is a squad leader with a stipend of 1,200 koku. I don't know him. I know your whole family is stiff just like you. So none of you would come to this part of town. But everyone around here knows about Mai and Yorisada. I still cannot believe it. I have to find out from Mai myself. Do you think she will tell you the truth? This is… It was your wedding gift to Mai, right? But why? I saw a woman who goes to that meeting place wearing it. So I asked if she stole it She said someone threw it away. Mai has been wearing a tortoise shell hairpin lately. Yorisada gave it to her. Master, please wait! Welcome home.. Ouch! Master! Master! What's the emergency, Yashichi? My.. my master... hurt Madam. Shinnosuke hurt Mai? No way. What happened? Calm down and tell me. Master came home past midnight... Past midnight? Master! Master! Master! Welcome home, Master. Is Mai badly hurt? She.. she passed away! Shinnosuke! I'm here to pick up Mai's body. I heard you killed Mai. Will you tell me why? I found out Mai committed adultery with Squad Leader Yamajiri Saburosuke's second son Yorisada. I executed her according to the samurai code. Idiot! You, more than anyone, know how faithful she was to you! People in Shumoku town and Sazaki town know about them. You know they get drunk and make up rumors! A samurai's wife shouldn't even let such a rumor start! Are you insane? I saw it. Kuramochi-dono. I saw them together at the meeting place in Shumoku town. I heard about your drinking habit. I didn't know it was this bad. What did you say? Shinnosuke. We can talk later. I'm going to bring Mai's body home now. What.. What have you done? I'm telling you the truth, Kinpei. Mai really was... Master, is that... Where did you find it? Madam was looking everywhere for it... saying it was something important to her. She did not want to greet you without a hair accessory. So, she just bought a tortoiseshell hairpin right before you came home. Bring her home! Mai is my wife.. Mai is my wife! She is mine! Iwane. Yes. HAKUTSURU CASTLE, BUNGO (WHITE CRANE CASTLE) Shinnosuke Kawade should not have executed his wife so carelessly. He should have brought up the matter to the clan BUNGO SAKIMAE CHIEF INSPECTOR HIGASHI GENNOJO and waited for the clan to gave sanction. BUNGO SEKIMAE PROVINCIAL CHIEF RETAINER SHISHIDO BUNROKU As for Kobayashi Kinpei, BUNGO SEKIMAE PROVINCIAL CHIEF RETAINER SHISHIDO BUNROKU His actions are understandable considering that his sister was falsely accused of adultery and killed. As a samurai, he had a perfectly good reason to execute Shinnosuke and his Uncle Juzo. Chief Inspector. Yes, Sir. You are mistaken. If Shinnosuke was to seek the clan's sanction after finding out about her adultery, he would have been accused of being weak minded. The reason he brought up his wife's adultery to Kinpei He was not against the samurai code. Kinpei should have just taken his sister's body and left immediately. By killing Shinnosuke and Kuramochi Juzo, he committed an unlawful act. Therefore, Kobayashi Kinpei is a criminal. But that will mean that our clan would lose Kinpei on top of Shinnosuke. So what? Those two men, and the chief samurai, Sakazaki-sama's son Iwane just returned home from their rotation in Edo. They are essential men for the future of our clan. I, too, regret this... that our clan had wasted our finances on fools like them! I don't understand it. How did such a rumor start about such a sweet couple? And why did Shinnosuke-dono believe it? I should have told my brother sooner. What do you know? Did something happen while we were away? About two months ago, I went to a cafe with Mai-sama and Nao-sama. That was when... Isn't it delicious? Yes. Yamajiri Yorisada-sama fell in love with Nao-sama. What? With Nao-dono? Nao-sama rejected him and explained to him that she was engaged. But Yorisada-sama sent fabrics, fans and makeup to Nao-sama and kept asking to see her. When Mai-sama found out about this, she wrote a letter to Yamajiri-sama telling him to stop. Later, Juzo-sama came to Mai-sama with a letter. It was a letter to Mai-sama from Yorisada-sama. He asked Mai-sama to meet him at a certain place so he can apologize. That must have been the place in Shumoku town. Mai-sama went to return the gifts to Yorisada-sama. I know. Because Shinnosuke's Uncle Kuramochi went with her, she must have felt safe enough to go. Yorisada-sama stopped approaching Nao-sama then, but… That's when the rumor started. Mai-sama was often seen where she shouldn't have been. Iwane! I just heard that Kinpei went to the Yamajiri residence. He killed Yorisada-sama and threw his body on the street! Kinpei.... I must go back to the castle. Big brother! Iyo.. if anything should happen to me, give this to Nao-dono. This is outrageous! Higashi, I am assigning you to lead the men to execute Kobayashi Kinpei immediately. Yes, sir! Sorry! By the order given to us, we are here to execute Kobayashi Kinpei! Don't resist us! Go! Musket Troop! Higashi-sama. Kobayashi Kinpei is my friend He won't hurt me. He has killed 8 men already. He is not in his right mind. I want to tell him the truth. Kinpei It's Iwane. I have found out the truth. Mai-dono... never committed adultery. Yamajiri Yorisada had feelings for Nao-dono. Mai-dono wrote him a letter telling him to stop approaching her sister and sending her gifts. Yorisada asked Mai-dono to meet him so he can apologize. Mai-dono agreed since Kuramochi Juzo-dono escorted her. She only went to return the gifts. But people started making up false rumors about them. Shinnosuke didn't have to kill Mai-dono. You didn't have to kill Shinnosuke either. None of it was necessary, Kinpei! Kinpei... Iwane, I have one wish. Have a fair match with me. Kinpei.. Sleepy... Iwane.... Did we catch any? Ah, darn! We caught one! We caught one! We caught a big one! Let's bring it in! Okon-chan... Ko-chan, San-chan, Hei-chan, OKON you must watch where you're going. Sorry. Oh, that's a big eel! We're bringing it to Miyatogawa. Yippee! FUKAGAWA-ROKKEMBORICHO, EDO Let's go. MIYATOGAWA Tetsugoro-san, we brought you an eel! Oh, that's a big one. How about this? EEL RESTAURANT "MIYATOGAWA" OWNER TETSUGORO Little more! Please Tetsugoro-san. Please buy it higher. Please Higher? Well... How about this? Yes! 30 mon it is! Okon-chan, what are you doing here so early? Sorry to come so early. We want a delivery. Imazuya's owner is having some important guests for lunch. Thanks for your business always. Of course, your eel is the best in Edo! Well, aren't you sweet? And one more thing, Osayo-san. Do you know a strong man? A strong man? Boss wants to hire a bodyguard. A bodyguard? Yes.... Is he in danger? Trouble comes with running a big business like his. I will ask my boss later. Thank you! Please do. He must be new. Ronin-san! Ah, Kokichi-dono. You're pretty good at that! Do you think so? I appreciate it. I'm glad I brought you here! Indeed. All thanks to you, Kokichi-dono. Don't mention it. I scratch you back, and you scratch mine! Thank you again. Kobayashi Nao. I heard you've been caring for your sick parents. since your family was banished from the clan. You must feel uneasy about your living conditions. Thank you, but I understand your decision. I haven't been able to sleep well from worrying about you. As the clan leader, I've been thinking of ways to help your family. I could take care of you. You'll be my concubine. but I'll treat you well, as if you were my wife. I know you need money to buy medicine for your parents. I decline. My heart belongs to someone else. Is it Sakazaki Iwane? He left the clan and nobody knows where he has gone to. No matter what he does or where he is, I am Iwane-sama's wife for life. Fine. As you wish. Go ahead and starve to death! Shinnosuke.. Kinpei... Mai-dono... Sakazaki-san Ah, Mr. Landlord Are you getting used to cleaning eels? I still have a lot to learn, but I'm giving it my best. That's good. I can't thank you enough for helping me get this job. LANDLORD OF KINBEI'S PLACE KINBEI It was nothing. Are they paying you well? Of course. They are paying me 70 mon for my morning shift. And it comes with breakfast. I couldn't ask for more. Did you say 70 mon? Yes. Good grief! At this rate, I don't know when I can collect your rent. My apologies. All right, then. I'll introduce you to someone for another job. There's another one? Sure. Thank you so much for your care. I wouldn't want to kick you out in this cold weather. Thank you. Here we are. Imazuya? They're an exchange house, aren't they? Oh, so you know. May I come in? Yes. Yoshizo-san. Oh, it's you, Kinbei-san. What it is? Aren't you in luck? I found you a bodyguard! A bodyguard? Oh that. Yes CLERK OF MONEY EXCHANGE "IMAZUYA" YOSHIZO I'm sorry. That position is taken. We hired four instructors from the Ichimura dojo. Can't you hire one more? Why? What's wrong? Dad! What is it, Okon? Is everything okay? No, it isn't! You said they were hiring a bodyguard. Why didn't you tell me they already found someone? Well Dad, when I asked, you said I bug you too much! Dad! Why? Don't tell me you brought an eel shop worker as a bodyguard! Oh, you know him? I saw him in Miyatogawa's. I had Kokichi take him there. What? That was you too? You're such a busybody! Mr. Landlord was helping me. There's no way such a meek looking person can work as a bodyguard. Shut up! If a tomboy like you can be a maid, he can be a bodyguard! Please keep your voices down in the store. Kinbei-san, you just came here to see your daughter, didn't you? What me? No! Let's just leave, Sakazaki-san. Goodbye. Are you okay? Dad! What's with your attitude? You better leave before you get hurt, old man. Didn't your parents teach you to respect the elderly? I'll teach you some manners! Mr. Landlord! What's the meaning of this? Mr. Clerk. Won't you exchange my silver? 80 pieces of nanryo (silver coins). But it's after hours. Mr. Clerk, I know. These are counterfeit. What did you say? This is a counterfeit made of scrap iron. You'll get caught doing this. Well, why not? Let's see you catch me then. Sensei, sirs! Someone must have hired these young men to cause some trouble. Will you please ask them to leave? We'll let you go if you leave now. Hey! I'm just asking them to exchange my money here at a money exchange. And this is the service you give me? Are you going to exchange my silver or not? I refuse. Is that so? I'm Togoro of Bishamon, and I refuse to leave after being accused of a crime. Do you want to get hurt, townsman? I think you do. You won't get away! Shigemura-san! Let me help you. OWNER OF THE MONEY EXCHANGE "IMAZUYA" IMAZUYA KICHIEMON What's happening here? Master, it's a robbery. Sensei! how about you pull your weight and help out? I am Sasamura Hikoshichiro, Tanseki style from Ichimura dojo. Taneichi Jinnojo Boy, did we ever drop by at a bad time. Who is next? Your bodyguards are pathetic! I will go. What! You are delusional! You're no match for these guys! But you just recommended him to me. Well, I.... Taneichi, he's all yours. There's no need for any more bloodshed. Won't you please leave? What is your style? I learned a little at Sasaki Reien's dojo on Kanda-Jinbo street. That must be Jinshinkage style of Sasaki Dojo. The truth of the matter is, we are under a threat. Under a threat? The reason is... This. What is it? Nanryo. This is the new currency issued by the new shogunate elder, Tanuma Okitsugu-sama. We exchange 8 of these for 1 gold coin (1 ryo). So 8 nanryo are worth 1 ryo. As you know, we use gold in Edo, and they use silver in Kyoto. Tanuma-sama wishes to issue a currency that can be used in both Edo and Kyoto. What is moving this world around is not swords and spears. It's money. EDO SHOGUNATE ELDER TANUMA OKITSUGU We agree with him, but most money exchanges are against his plan. Why is that? Dad! It's a shame, but there are some money changers that make profits from the market fluctuation of gold and silver. If the price of gold collapses because of nanryo they won't be able to keep up their profit. Awaya Yurakusai-dono is the head of those who are against nanryo. Normally, 10 pieces of silver are worth 1 gold coin. OWNER OF THE MONEY EXCHANGE "AWA-YA" AWAYA YURAKUSAI But they are telling us to trade 8 nanryo for 1 gold coin. This is going to collapse the price of gold. This is like convincing people black is white. This is bad money. So, Awaya is threatening you because he is against the nanryo plan, and you are for it. Yes, that's why I hired bodyguards. But I wasn't expecting the situation to escalate to what happened tonight. Sakazaki-san, will you please be our official bodyguard? I will be honored. Master says you have the night shift, from sundown until sunrise. He wants to pay you 2 bu every 10 days. What? 2000 mon for 10 days? But he saw what this man can do! He's so cheap! I heard him about being cheap, they were right! Don't talk about my boss like that, Dad. Kinbei-san, that amount is enough for me. Don't be so modest. This is your bonus from last night. He will give you bonuses for your future work too. I wonder how he values your work of last night? Let's see how much he gave you. Don't be like that, Dad. It's 3 ryo. Is he sure about this? Of course Thank you very much. Hold it. I'll take this as your rent. What? Finally! Okay... I am Sakazaki Iwane, Nice to meet you. I am Shinagawa Ryujiro. My father serves the shogun. BODYGUARD OF THE MONEY EXCHANGE "IMAZUYA" SHINAGAWA RYUJIRO I am Takemura Buzaemon, I used to serve the Todo clan. BODYGUARD OF THE MONEY EXCHANGE "IMAZUYA" TAKEMURA BUZAEMON We're poor samurai getting by with this job. You didn't have to say that. I'm sorry. Do you know the men who came last night? I've seen Togoro from Bishamon at the gambling house. Takemura-san, you shouldn't gamble. You are married with children. I didn't Idiot! They hired me as bodyguard! I'm sorry. Was Togoro gambling there? I don't know. I want to ask you two a favor. If you will help me, I'll see to it that you will get paid. I want you to spy on Bishamon no Togoro. Please follow him and find out where he goes. and whom he meets. 4 and 1, even! Can we join? Please step inside. Odd! Even! Ready? Here we go. 2 and 2, even! It's even! Place your bet now. Matsukichi Juhei. Take a look at these eels Sakazaki-san cleaned. His cuts are so precise and even. A fillet like this can be cooked efficiently. It makes it easier for the chef, and delicious for our customers. I leave plenty of flesh on bones, so they make good broth. Idiot! Learn from Sakazaki-san He's such a strange man. Why? He's never in a hurry, always smiling, always peaceful. But he does twice as much work as I do. Now that's how a skilled man should be. I wish we could taste their eel! Kokichi-dono, I'll treat you. Really? Of course How much are they? Eel are cheaper at Miyatogawa's. They are 160 mon. 160 mon. So three eels will be 480. Thanks anyway, Ronin-san. I got a message from Awaya. He says to do it tonight. Oh, I've been waiting for this! That man who killed Taneichi will be there at the store,right? Yes. Remember Kuroiwa, our target is Imazuya Kichiemon. Why, you! Wait! Damn! He's one of the bodyguards! Is he Sakazaki Iwane? No, he's nobody. It will be 48 mon for 3 sticks. GRILLED EEL Thank you Ronin-san. Thank you. Sorry I couldn't afford the one from Miyatogawa's. Now our whole families can enjoy our rice tonight while smelling this. I'm glad. Sakazaki-san! Takemura-san was cut! Imazuya-dono, Takemura-san has a wife and 4 children. I know it was my decision to send him but will you please.... Sakazaki-san, say no more... I will cover his medical costs, and his family's living expenses. We will also pay you and Shinagawa-san for your work. Thank you so much. How dreadful that they are after my master's life! And you also found out that Awaya-san hired them? Yes, Shinagawa-san found out that someone from Awaya's helped those men get a rental place. I suspected that Awaya Yurakusai-dono was behind all this. We also discovered something else. Bishamon no Togoro has been seen at the gambling hall with a certain man. This man has been buying nanryo. Nanryo? He's most likely Awaya's man. But why would Awaya's collect nanryo? Himura-sama has been in charge of minting nanryo since the beginning. He is troubled by the recent incident. I am Sakazaki Iwane. OVERSEER OF THE GOLD MINT HIMURA TSUNAMICHI Sakazaki-dono. What is your opinion on the recent incident? Clearly, this was Awaya-dono's attempt to bring down Tanuma-sama's nanryo plan and his supporter Imazuya-dono. Indeed. However, no matter how powerful Awaya-dono might be, it's a risky move for him to plot against the shogunate. So there must be someone behind him Well done! You are a clever man! It's Sakai-sama. We suspect Sakai Masasuke-sama is the one behind Yurakusai. He's been a shogunate elder longer than Tanuma-sama. But now that Tanuma-sama has more authority than him, EDO SHOGUNATE ELDER SAKAI IYO-NO-KAMI MASASUKE he is jealous. Whoever against this plan is antiquated. I am not in need of such men. Yes, sir. Sakai-sama has been against every one of Tanuma-sama's proposals including the nanryo plan. The nanryo plan also does not sit well with Yurakusai. who takes advantage of the market fluctuation. So they have a common goal. That's why they are plotting to kill Imazuya-dono, who is pro-nanryo. Good grief! I have a massage from Sasaki Sensei. He says to come visit him at his dojo when you feel better. Sakazaki-san. I think there is more to what happened at your hometown. I know we can't change the past. But I believe we met each other for a reason. If you keep pursuing your current mission, perhaps a new way will be revealed. Kichiemon-dono. Please get inside the carriage. Kyushichi-san! Yes Please take the master to safety. Yes! This way! Get off me! Bishamon no Togoro. Sakazaki! I know you sent a man to spy on us! So that's Sakazaki Iwane! I don't want anyone to die. Leave now and I'll let you go. Die! Alert the officers. Yes! Your turn, Kuroiwa. Awesome Tendo! Kuroiwa Juzaburo! You're the one who hurt Takemura-san. Sakazaki I guess we'll continue next time. There won't be a next time. Awesome! I like that. Sakazaki Iwane! Let's meet again. Sakazaki-san! I'm okay, Otsune-san, please bring me hot water. I got it. Okiyo, get a bandage and alcohol. Give me a second. Come in. Thanks. You are good. Any woman around here can do this. Can you walk? Let's go then. Thank you. Kobayashi Kinpei. Kawade Shinnosuke. and his wife, Mai. They were my friends since childhood. Ready, Iwane? Here I come, Kinpei! Go Kinpei! Go Iwane! All right! Let me see. Ah, that looks good on you. Doesn't it? Yes. Doesn't it? Yes, it does. Take care of it. Yes. But... Mai is mine! No..! That cannot be...! Where is Nao-sama now? The lady who was going to marry you, what happened to her? I don't know. You don't know? Kinpei's family was banished from the clan. They moved out. I asked my clan for my discharge and left. And that's it? What could I do? I killed her brother. It's too cruel! I feel bad for Nao-sama! I'm sorry. I know it's hard for you too. Tell me, what is she like? I know you must care deeply about her. I can't remember her well. But I do remember the last time I saw her... It was three years ago.. She said to me in front of white nanten flowers... I promise to love you only. She looked at me... I will be waiting for you. With her tearing eyes. I will be back in three years. Then will you be with me for the rest of your life? Yes, Iwane-sama. I remember her face from that day, then it fades away. Sakazaki-san! Sakazaki-san! What is it? I just fell asleep. Please come at once! It's an emergency! Sakazaki-san. My apologies for keeping you waiting, Awaya-dono. I heard you were attacked at the shrine. You better watch your back. We merchants never know who might turn against us or when. I will take your advice. Do that. Have you heard? The price of nanryo has collapsed in Kyoto. Yes, I am aware of that. We hear you're announcing that the market price of 8 nanryo is 1 ryo. It wasn't our decision. As long as we operate our business with a government permit, we have our obligation to accommodate our customers. That's my master's principle. What generous man! That's Imazuya all right! He intends to support that government single-highhandedly. Wait, Sakazaki-sama. Please excuse me. I am Sakazaki Iwane. May I ask Awaya-sama a question? Who is this ill-mannered man? Ask away. Thank you. Do you exchange nanryo in accordance to its market price? Unlike Imazuya, I am spineless. If nanryo's value lowers to 11, I trade for 11. And if it lowers to 13, I trade for 13. That's how you run a business. I see. Shall we be leaving? Yes. You must be the new bodyguard. I know Imazuya-san is really counting on you. But samurai and merchants are different. You don't know the way of the merchant. I wonder how much use you will be in time of need? MONEY EXCHANGE IMAZU-YA Thank you. Please come again. Ma'am, how may I help you? Please exchange these for 1 ryo. May I see them? Yes. We require a service fee. Yes, a service fee. I accept this 20 mon as your service fee. Shinzaburo, come here. Is something the matter? She is not our regular, is she? Correct. But she knew that our service fee is 20 mon? Yes. Hey, someone, can you help me? Trade my 8 nanryo for 1 ryo, please. Excuse me Will you trade these for 1 ryo? We traded 2,856 pieces of nanryo with 357 ryo today. It has begun and this is out of control. They've hired workman, merchants, and even female day workers. What is the nanryo's current value to 1 ryo? It's about 10 nanryo. 12 nanryo. Our next move is when value drops to 12 nanryo. We'll bring large amount of nanryo to Imazuya's and make a killing. If they bring in a large amount of nanryo, we will be forced to close down. Not only that, the public will recognize Tanuma's plan as a failure. We must avoid that. I want to protect Tanuma-sama's plan at all cost. But.. We'll show Imazuya Kichiemon how it ends. and Tanuma's rule will be crushed by the weight of nanryo. Sakazaki-san! Kinbei-dono. What brings you here? Take a look! Ah! The new oiran-dochu at Yoshiwara! Her freedom is priced at 1,200 ryo. No, that's not it! "Price of nanryo collapses"? What does that mean? Let me see. Wow, nanryo really took a heavy fall! So if we can trade one ryo for 12 nanryo, and take them to Imazuya's, They will give us 1 ryo plus 4 nanryo. And we buy more nanryo with that gold. No time to waste! Let's do it! Idiot! If you do that, I'm cutting ties with you. But everyone must be thinking the same thing. Imazuya-dono will never change his mind about this. He says he will continue to exchange as long as his assets allow. He is too honorable for his own good! MONEY EXCHANGE IMAZU-YA I'm sure Sakazaki-san will come up with a plan. It involves goverment approved currencies. I don't think even Sakazaki -san can do anything about this. No, I'm next! It's finally time to put Imazuya through hell. Let's open the shop. Yes. Keep up the good work. Hey! Hello, Senzokuya-san and good men from the fish market. How may I help you? What's your exchange rate for nanryo? What a strange question. It's 8 nanryo for 1 piece of gold. Don't mess with me. OWNER OF FISH MARKET "SENZOKU-YA" JINBEI We all know that the price of nanryo dropped. May I ask why your business requires nanryo? We have to keep up with the current market. I'm cashing them in at Imazuya's. How clever! So you want my business or what? How much gold will you be exchanging? Ten thousand ryo. What shall we do? Are you sure he said he is cashing them in at Imazuya's? Yes. Senzokuya-san, we can trade your 5,000 ryo. at the rate of 1 ryo to 13 nanryo. Is that the best you can do? Trade my whole 10,000! Well, nanryo has not been in circulation long enough yet. The best we can do is to trade 5,000 ryo. Can't be helped. Guys! Give them 5,000 ryo. Yes! Excuse me. Okay. We accept these. Don't drop them! Shall I recount the silver? Don't waste my time! I'm trusting you gave me what you said you did. Imazuya can count the silver. Let's go! Yes! Hello, master from Nakaoka Theatre. How may I help you? I would like some nanryo OWNER OF "NAKAOKA THEATRE" NAKAOKA KUNIEMON Does your theatre require nanryo? I want to make a little money. I brought 3,000 ryo. Are you bringing your nanryo to Imazuya's? Must I tell you? Let's keep it civil. All that time gathering nanryo, and now, 8,000 of them are gone already. Yes, we missed out on making big money. That's fine. What matters is that Imazuya will be forced to shut down. and Tanuma-sama will lose his reputation. Once Sakai-sama replaces Tanuma-sama Awaya's future will be secured. How much nanryo do we have left? We have about 4,300 left. But there are some counterfeits within them. Hello, Awaya-san Hello, Awaya's master. Oh my, is that you, Takao Oiran.? What a surprise! I wanted to see this nanryo everyone is talking about. TOP FEMALE ENTERTAINER OF BROTHEL "MIURA-YA" TAKAO DAYU I wanted to see this nanryo everyone is talking about. Even oiran collect nanryo? Even in the brothel business, money is essential. OWNER OF BROTHEL "MIURA-YA" SHOEMON We know nanryo's price will drop even more. We of the Yoshiwara must do what it takes to prepare ourselves. Takao-oiran has traveled all this way herself. We must accommodate her request. My apologies, but this is all the nanryo we have. You are in the presence of Chief Treasurer Kawai Hisataka. Awaya, we require your cooperation. CHIEF TREASURER KAWAI HISATAKA I am the chief treasurer, Kawai Hisataka. Yes, sir! Are you the manager of the store? Yes, I am the manager of Awaya's, Sabei. Answer me, Sabei. Sir, these are... Answer me. Yes sir. They are nanryo. Inspect them Yes, sir! Miuraya, At what exchange rate did you purchase this nanryo? Sir, I purchased them at the rate of 1 ryo to 13 nanryo. 1 ryo to 13 nanryo? Kawai-sama, I found some counterfeits. Awaya, for manipulating the price of nanryo by breaking the market price of 8 nanryo to 1 ryo, we are arresting the owner, Awaya Yurakusai until further investigation. Arrest Yurakusai! Look in the back! Check the rear! Don't let him escape! To all of you for accommodating our difficult request. No need to thank us. Anything for Imazuya-san. Thank you very much. Did they catch Awaya? I heard he escaped. What a coward! Himura-sama informed me that they're closing down all the exchange houses siding with Awaya. I had fun. It's not everyday I get to be a part of such a delightful play. It was all Sakazaki-san's idea. Not even our professional scriptwriters would come up with such a clever idea. Well... You are not only smart but also a cute bodyguard. Do you want to see me tonight? It's rare that Takao finds a man she likes! Sakazaki-sama, how about we all go to my store and have a good time? Excuse me. He's blushing! Sakazaki-san I know she is waiting for you. Nao-san is still waiting to be rescued by you. Congratulations! You've done it. Awaya A samurai manipulates the market to shut down an exchange house. You sure put me to shame. I want to see you and Imazuya get what you deserve. That's fair business. I'll hear your request. Please let go of Okon-dono. What? Are you sleeping? You reap what you sow... Sakazaki Iwane! Upon returning to your hometown after completing your Edo rotation. you ended up killing your childhood friend Kobayashi Kinpei, and leaving the clan. Which brought you back to Edo. Now why couldn't you just lay low? If it wasn't for you..! Get him! I have no reason to obey your orders. I want to have a fair match with you. Iwane, I have a wish. Have a fair match with me. Okon-dono You can't run... You will keep killing people... Many, countless people... Every time you do, you will remember... How you felt when... you killed your childhood friend! It is a living hell. Sakazaki-san! I know it's a living hell. I must live the rest of my life without my friends or the woman I love. It's more cruel than to die. But I choose.. to live. Even if it means my life is a living hell. I should have visited you as soon as I arrived in Edo. Please forgive me. What are you doing? Get ready. Yes. Iwane. I'm glad you came. Yes, sir. This is for you from someone. They said to give it to you if you ever stopped by. Who? Well, Iwane. Yes Someone from the Yoshiwara. (Red-light district) Yoshiwara? I had no idea you were going to Yoshiwara. and telling all the ladies that you are my student. No, I'd never... But it really was a messenger from Yoshiwara. They knew your name too. I suppose you want your privacy. But I didn't... Iwane-sama was I dreaming this whole time? I don't know how we ended up with such tragedy. You are banished from the clan. Get to work. Iwane-sama When I heard that you killed my brother, what thought do you think came to my mind? The first thing I thought of was that I wanted to see you. I wanted to be by your side to be your comfort. But you left. You left without saying a word. All I had left was the scented pouch you gave me. But no matter what happens, my feeling towards you have not changed since my childhood. I had to come up with a way to support my sick parents and myself. And I had made up my mind. I am going to be a nanten plant. The colder the winter, the more vibrant I will become. I will bear my sorrow for not being able to see you, and live my life as a strong woman. I started my journey by going to Maruyama town in Nagasaki. From there, I traveled all around, including Kyoto. Now, I am in Edo. Let me through. Excuse me Here comes Hakkaku-dayu! Sorry. Sorry. Excuse me She will be working at Chojiya. Nao! Iwane-sama Please do not be sad for me, or pity me for the life I chose. Sorry. Excuse me Nao... Nao Nao Nao Nao Nao Nao Nao Nao Nao Iwane-sama The scented pouch you gave me is my support. I was, and I will be...

Sorry I'm out of rice, and out of miso too. You're jobless again? What am I going to do with you? I'm sorry. Sakazaki-san Okon Imazuya's owner needs you. Kichiemon-dono needs me? He has a job for you. What a good timing! Oh yeas, right! What? Nothing. I was just thinking that there is a way for him to stay here rent free. What do you mean? I know you like him. You're being weird, Dad? What are you talking about? You know... I'm ready. Let's go then. I hope this will help you. Save up to pay that 1,200 ryo to redeem her. Thank you for your concern. I think they make a good couple.
