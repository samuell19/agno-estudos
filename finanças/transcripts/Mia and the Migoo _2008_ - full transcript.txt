... "Oh, I played the jack... instead of the king! I'm so stupid! You sure are stupid! Take it easy Pedro... Don't know what he's got. He's worried... He frets about his daughter. To do this job, you must know how to live far from your family. You have to realise that his kid is alone in his village. That'd be bad. Is there no one to look after her? You wouldn't understand what a family is. What did you say?! Calm down, you two! Are we playing or fighting? Is this a joke!? Baklava, what made you decide to work at this project? The dough of course! You weren't scared off by what you heard? About the two bulldozers? It's slippery around here. I don't worry about past events. What about you? Why are you here? Isn't it better than being stuck in town?! You could do a lot worse. - What about you, Nenesse? - Me? Me?! Ha ha ha! So... are you playing?! That's all I can do. You're seeing a pro in action, chaps! Take a look at these three cards! Queen... King... Finishing with... Final trick... 10 points! These two oddballs don't want us! Right, Piche old chap? Nothing we could do. It happened when we were sleeping. You're not employed here to sleep! But Sir, it fell down by itself! "By itself"! That's the 2nd catastrophe in a fortnight, Barsikof! "Malakof", Sir. That'll do, "Bourrikof"! Understood? Enough! It's the curse! Calm down! We can't work here! Don't panic! There's something very disturbing. Please calm down! Hey, who's there?! Anybody there?! Get out of there! Can you hear me?! Daddy...! Daddy...! Mummy... Just about everybody has left the village. Every night, I see Daddy in my dreams. I miss him so much. I've decided! I'm going to find him! Yes! Don't you worry... I’ll manage. I'm not 5 anymore, Mummy! Goodbye, Mummy dear. Mia... what are you doing? I'm going to find Daddy. Surely not?! I can't go on without him. You can't do it... We're responsible for you. I miss him too much. We understand, dear, but you're too little. Mia, we all love you here. Yes, I know very well. I love you too, but I can't help it... He's my daddy. But imagine the dangers! My charms will protect me! Goodness! Off she went... Welcome, Mr Houston! Must be a heat wave! Unfortunately it's continuing. Crazy! How are you supposed to hold it?! I'm seeing Mr Jeckide. Mr Jeckide is waiting for you. -OK! How many rooms? 240,000! No, 2,400, with a view of the 3 most prestigious peaks. A unique project. It's one of the last places with a pleasant temperature. We're putting the access tunnel through. All very impressive. Profitability should exceed 13 per cent per year. It's very tempting! I'm sorry I'm late. Hello, Mr Houston! This is the Yank I told you about. We're all here! We’ll be able to sign our agreements. -Pssst! Mr Jeckide... Excuse me a moment. Johnson can explain all the details of the operation. Well, these are the stages of the project. What is it? We're getting a signature. It's very important... - I believe... - What is it?! It's about the site... They were very confused on the phone... Something has tied the cranes in knots... And the tunnel collapsed... It's a disaster...! They've found tracks... gigantic footprints... They are talking about a monster! Sir, what should I do now? Scram! Problems? Just some regulatory details. If you like, we can sign the contracts! I'm sorry Mr Jeckide... ...but we would need to go visit the site first. It's so far away! - Surely you don't... - We're adamant! Yes, good... alright... Sign first... then we’ll visit the site. Veree importanta... Nyet viseet... nyet signature. They're making it a precondition. Well... In that case... Johnson, go and prepare my private jet. Thanks for packing my luggage, Mother. I'm off! Wait! Leave them there. They aren't yours! What?! I'm going for seawater therapy. Seawater therapy? It's been planned for a month! I'm going to flee the heat wave. I need to leave right away, too. Well get yourself organised. What about the kid? Fend for yourself! If you'd been able to hang on to your wife... ...you'd have no problem. Mum... Aldrin, come say goodbye to granny! Aldrin! You're leaving already? Yes, I'm running late. Someone's been waiting for me for half an hour. Bye bye! Have fun! Be a good boy! And you take good care of him. - Come in! - Howdy! This is Charlemagne. - He's terrific! - That's me! He's going to take me. How's it going? No worries? They yours? I think I'll take them. Excuse me, Sir! Allow me! Come on, we haven't much time. Don't you worry now, my poppet! I wish you'd stop calling me your poppet! Sorry, sweetie pie! Kisses to both of you! Daddy, Mummy sent an email. It's her 30th day on the ice-floe. I'll never understand her. Did I marry a meteorologist or a penguin? Come on, you're coming with me. She's a scientist, Daddy! She's never there. They may find out how to deal with the heat. She thinks she's going to save the planet. You're too hard on Mummy. Just concentrate on getting ready! Do you love her, or don't you? Go and get you suitcase! Hurry up! So am I coming with you? Yes... I guess so. Yippee! I'm stuck with him. Someone's coming... It's her! It's her! Hello! Can I get across the river, here? I want to get to the other side. The bridge collapsed! You don't have a boat or something? - No, there's nothing here. - Very sorry. But you can ask Pablo. He can solve any problem. Pablo's our brother. Follow the river, you'll find him further down. Very well... thank you. Goodbye! Hello... anybody there? What's going on? You can wake people up doing that! Can you help me? Promise to wake me gently with a little kiss! Come on! - Stop! Help me cross. - Where are you going? You're too nosey... I just want to cross the river. Have you seen how deep it is? It's weird. The water is different to usual. What's happening? Perhaps it's coming from the mountain. That's where I want to go. The Mountain! You're quite mad! Nobody's ever returned from there! They say there are monsters there who eat people. It looks like I'll have to fend for myself. You're going to get smashed up! You'll see... What are you doing? Aren't I allowed to? - You'll be afraid! - I'm never afraid! So, what are you waiting for? I'd better do this. Wow! I never would have believed it would work! Thank you! - Thank you, Pablo! - Goodbye, Mia! Good luck! Is the Tokyo stock exchange going up? Yes, it's been rising since the 1st quarter. Something to drink, young man? Thank you! Are we nearly there? In about 2 hours. The clouds make a sea of cotton-wool. Never flown before? No, my father's never taken me. Big pile of junk! That monster thinks he can do anything! You were sleeping. That happens all the time. Thank you, my pet! You're going to look for your father all by yourself? Yes. You're going right to the top of the mountains, are you? That's right! And surely you've heard all the stories about that place? Yes... that it's dangerous. You know there's also a way through the forest. Yes, I know. - It's not possible! - Why? Because it's cursed! I have to find my father! Understand?! Listen, young lady... I know that the forest is inhabited by demons. You could be eaten by wolves! I'm not afraid of anything at all! Neither demons nor wolves! It's sheer madness! My father is all I've got. You are really stubborn! Boss... everything's ready as you ordered. Good old Rosario... I can always rely on him! Make sure he gets this. Welcome to Puerto Del Migos, Senor! We're not moving... It's always traffic jams here! Yes, that's the way it is in Puerto Del Migos! Impossible! You can't get on without a ticket. Pretty please! - Go away! - What if I give you this? You're starting to get on my nerves! Are you gonna keep us sweating here, with your chitchat? We've been waiting an hour in the heat and the dust... ...to get on this rattletrap of yours! And is our luggage up there secured properly? We have the right to a little dignity! Come on! - The choppers are ready! - Great. Let's get moving! Keep going, driver! It's the radiator... Not a drop of water left. There's a blockage. What can be done? Just let me get through! Dumb men! They ask for lunch at 2 pm. You need water? Well do something about it! Did she wee? Oh, I've got the urge! - Let me pass! - I have eye drops! You're still there?! Really! Go on... scram! Scram! Go on... beat it! Well, here we are... What do you think? It's quite magnificent! Very impressive! There will be 6 hotels over on the left! We are going to build a small port and a cable car. The resort will run at full capacity and will be reserved exclusively for the jet-set. Of course. Where will the access tunnel emerge? Under the big rock on the left. There'll be a short road, to connect. What a beautiful set-up! Beautiful! Splendid! The tree, the thing in the middle, what is it? Are you going to keep it? Absolutely not! We'll erase that eyesore. I see you have a sense of humour! I invested all my fortune in it. To be successful, I need their money. They have to sign. I had to bribe dozens of civil servants. I ruined my family life. This project must happen! Can you hear me? Do you want to do a new flyover? That'll do. We can go back. I hope my colleagues agree... It's a very exciting project! We'll go back and sign the contracts. We're not quite ready yet! There are some legal matters that need to be clarified. As you wish... I'll leave you to return alone. I need to visit the site. See you later! Congratulations! See you later, my friends! It's incomprehensible. Look at this site! I have to get on top of this. It would have been terrible if the others had seen this. That's for sure! Plus one guy got caught in the cave-in. That can always happen. Johnson, have some chrysanthemums sent to the man's wife. Where are the rest of the workers? They were panic-stricken. They've all run off. These are the only ones left. - You want to see the tracks? - Ah yes, that nonsense of yours... You don't seriously think that I'd swallow that? Well, they are real. Come and see. Shit! Chrysanthemums! Unacceptable! Our life is worth nothing! They treat us like animals! We're nothing like animals! Do you know what I think? Tell us later. Let's get Pedro out of there. If he's still alive. Get back to work, you guys! This thing must be at least 10 metres high! We didn't make it up! What can we do about it? Against something like that, there's only one way. We have to look for that thing, find it... ...and do away with it! Hey, what are THEY doing? I think they may be after me. We're not in the... Hello, darling, it's Mummy. - Mummy?! - So glad to talk to you at last. Communications are difficult from the Antarctic. So, how are you? I miss you so much. I miss you, too. What are you doing so far away? Daddy's taken me with him. I'm at Puerto Del Migos.. Well, that's what I thought. And how's he going? Same as ever. Always wrapped up in his project. Nothing else. I hate it! He'll change in the end. I'd just like so much for us all to be together. You don't get too bored? No, I brought my telescope. And you see the stars better here than at home! I'll be home soon. You can tell me about it. - Alright? - Sure! How are things with you? You don't get too cold? I don't complain. Our research is going well. The sea ice has melted by more than half... Mummy, a meteorite just crashed into my room! A meteorite?! There are millions falling out of the sky! That must be magnificent. What a spectacle! Looks like a mega fireworks display! Nature sometimes comes up with the most sublime surprises. I can't hear you well... It's cutting out. I love you sweetie! I love you too, Mummy! Oh... Mummy! Daddy! Wake up! - Daddy! - What is it? A meteorite fell into my room! - 3 o'clock?! - Isn't this amazing? Did you see what the time is? But Daddy, it's a meteorite... That's enough! You never listen to me. What are you talking about?! You put me down all the time. Put you down? You never play with me. Never talk with me. You've never loved me. You don't hug me. Is that so? You're right... I just don't know how! Nobody taught me. Very well then... Tomorrow you'll come with me. We'll spend the day together. Just the two of us. But that will be something different to your dreams about the stars! There are people who deserve to find what they are looking for. You are one of them. Your faith is stronger. I can see your father! My father? Where is he? Somewhere in that forest... Oh, a danger! I see earth, roots! A big black hole, and monsters! But what's it all about? I don't understand. Just look up! Look carefully. Do you see them? I've spoken to them. They'll help you. What are they? Use them! You can trust them! You'll find them in the forest. What happened to my hair? Go... the forest awaits you. You'll be a lot better without your mop! Hey... wait... Take that for your journey. Thank you ma'am. Next time, you'll ask first. Are you looking for something for big game? Yes, for very big game! I have exactly what you need! I feel good here. What a great smell! I can feel it's the smell of strength! - It stinks! - Nonsense! Tomorrow you'll see... there'll be slaughter! It will be a grand adventure for us two men. You'll see life in the raw! I don't want to. For me, hunting is... You asked me to do things with you... Take it easy! These rockets can pierce 10 cm thick armour. It goes through it like butter, then boom! That's precisely what I need. It will be destroyed! Sure looks like it. And I'll take that flame-thrower. Yippee! It's a real pleasure to do business with you. Mummy... Hold me tight, Mummy... A little bit tighter... I've been so frightened, Mummy... Scared of wolves... Scared of the night... It's not what you think it is. It's only the little sound that breathes deep inside you. Don't be afraid to go back there. The demons do not exist. Nothing can ever happen to you... ...if you believe strongly in yourself. Good morning, Boss! Give me a hand here. I can see you haven't come empty-handed! Ah, there's sonny-boy. Hi! Good morning. Easy does it... Something new? Not really. They'll see anyway. Stop with doing that! There are more important things to do. Wait! What did you say? I want you to come with me! That's it. No argument! Not so fast! There's a man's life at stake here! Apart from everything else! Who do you think you are? When it comes down to it, this is about your safety! Precisely. Could we talk about our safety conditions? 78 kilos of explosive. Plus the rockets! That enough for your safety? Wait, you don't understand... I'll be back. - Johnson? - Am I disturbing you? It's OK, I’m just with the site labourers. Bad news, Boss! Got a message from your potential partners. They've decided to drop out of the project. What?! They found out about the site. What?! They say their decision is final. Oh, those bastards! Your share price is in free-fall... What are you saying?! The bank has abandoned you! Ha ha! Sorry. Nerves. You don't have a cent. You're ruined! Ruined! Sorry! Just nerves! I won't give up! You’re not gonna be a jerk, are you? Here he comes. Come on... let's go! Firstly, we have to rescue Pedro. We're not getting anywhere. We need machinery! Proper safety, eh?! Well, yes... I have worries, a billion times... ...more important than your petty problem! Don't get excited...! You're going to obey me! Follow me! All I have to say is, we are not budging! Right on! It's not alright, isn't it? Are you crazy?! This thing is the problem. I'm the only one who can catch it! Why do you want to kill it, Daddy? What's it done? It's vermin. It has to be destroyed. That would be murder, wouldn't it? Murder?! This thing is not human. What do you know about it? What do I know about it? I know it! That's all. Now shut up and stop bugging me! Both holes covered? Yesterday... glug glug! Goodness me! Both holes covered...! "The demons don't exist..." "Nothing can hurt you if you believe strongly in yourself." Fingers too fat! Can't do anything... Friend? "Friend"? Yes. I'm looking for my father. "Father"? That's right, my father. What's "my father"? He's the one who gave me birth, with my mother. Help me find him. "Pere"?... Ah, "pere"! Dead easy! "Terre"! No, not that... Not "terre", "pere"! -"Pere"... "Pere"? "Pere"! Ah, "pere"! "Pere"! Ooooh! "Pere"! "Pierre"! [stone] Not that either. My father's not a rock. He's a "papa"! "Papa"? My father's alive, like us. Who are you? Me? Migou! Migou? What are you? Me Migou! - Is that a first name? - "First name"? What's that? Me, I'm Mia. You? Migou. My father is Pedro. He's alive, like you, like a Migou. Father alive! Alive! Like Migou! Yes! Leave me alone! Cut it out! - You grubby brat! - Don't like it? Here it is "alive stone"! You don't understand. You not right in the head! Silly-billy! - That's what you are! - No I'm not! What? Dopey the sleepy-head! - You not even father! - No, me "Migou"! That's me... "Migou"! Who was with me? ME! Who brought the other Migou? HIM! Which one is lying? No... no! Don't tickle me! No... no more tickling! A giant... Do you know where my father is? Sure do! Really? Oh yes! Climb on! Come on! MIGOU! MIGOU! Oh! Thief! Hey, you big oaf! You wanna get clobbered?! I was the first to see Mia! That's enough from you! My girlfriend! Not you! Get lost! I'm the winner! How did you do that? Tell me... Where's my father? Through there! It's beautiful! There's your father! What are you talking about? That's not my father, it's a tree. - It's done-for! - No it’s not! It's dead. Tree more alive than everything! - Holy! - Tree protect us! - Protect you from what? - Dangers! - What dangers? - All dangers! Monsters! Disasters! Always our guardian. It doesn't have leaves any more. Impossible to see with eyes! When trees are alive... ...they have leaves. With us, tree fears nothing. If holy tree, it dies... Migous die too! Who are you? -Me protect! -Me more strong! Piece of cake! Go get lost! Hey, wait... Beddy-byes! - Me protect stronger! - Big lunk! - Go to blazes! - Big oaf! You watch yourself! Migou? Migou! Where are you? Daddy?... Daddy?! Oh, my daddy! My darling daddy! I mistook you for my father. Your father? He works on that building project. Do you know where he is? Firstly... who were you with? With the Migous. They're too much! - How "too much"? - So comical. Where are these comical Migous now? They're here one minute, disappeared the next. They are my friends! They only seem to be. Come with me and I'll show you something. Coming? Stop! Tell her to hurry up! Can I help you? It's alright, thanks. They stopped my fall! How are they able to do that? It was like I was flying! They are just so strong! Flying? Wow, how lucky you were! Just like flying in a dream. Incredible! What is it? Something wrong with my face? That’s it! Didn’t you get on a bus with a lady? Oh, you saw me? Yes! Under her skirt! Nothing wrong with that! There's the site... See what was done there by your little pals! Oh! They couldn’t have...! Are you blind? No. Thank your lucky stars, kid... ...that they did nothing bad to you. I may have turned up just in time! Can you see your father down there? Aah... No. He's not there. Maybe he had to run off. I can help you find him. In the meantime, tell me where the Migous are. Something's not right... That couldn't have been the Migous! But it's a fact! Hasn't anyone told you about them? Yes, but ... They are simply destructive monsters. I have to tell them to stop. But I don't know where they are. You don't have a tiny little idea where they might be? Maybe near the tree in the lake. You mean that rotten old thing? They protect it. If the tree disappears, they die. I see...! Let's take a look down there! What's that madman doing now? He's really sick in the head! [Spanish] My car! Sorry, Boss! Pedro? See anything? Did he go through there? Got to go see! - You mean that tree? - Yes. - It's me who protects it! - No, me! It's me! Ha ha! Bulls-eye! You don't have the right! You've killed them! I've only started... Got to finish the job! You clumsy little fool! I meant to do it! Move over, you little brat! I'm not afraid of you! Like me to change your mind? Tell me where they hide! You know I'm looking for them! I don't care! The workers are looking for your father's body! Understand now? Your father! Liar! You're a liar! Who do you think you're talking to, you little viper! Stop carrying on, Daddy, otherwise I'll... You'll do what?! I gotta laugh! Your father's a maniac! Mia! Migou!... Migou?... Migou!! Good God, what have I done? Aldrin! This is your telephone service. What?! You've been one of our best customers for 3 years... What's this about?! You have won one hour of free calls. Congratulations! Secure the left flank! Send me reinforcements! Quickly! If you accept our offer, press "1"! To modify your account, press "2". If you prefer to reply later, press "3". If not, thank you for calling! Get off me! Get off me! I guess it's because of me that your father fired on the tree. It's not your fault. He has no respect for anyone. For him, nature is just a big bundle of cash. It's not fair. You have a father who loves you. I would have preferred that the tunnel collapsed on mine. I don't know. My father can't be dead. He's alive. I'm sure of it. Oh, my goodness...! - Who is it? - The Migous! They're not the giants? That depends... Sometimes yes. What's he saying? The Migous have explained... That tree is like the centre of the world. If something bad happens to it, we'll be in danger. It's really messed up. How is it still standing? If it falls, it'll be the end of everything. The end of the world? That's impossible. Unfortunately, if... If you don't believe me... ...you can believe them... They're the Migous. Goddamned dirty stinking one-eyed brute! My cell phone... My cell phone... It's not working... I get all the luck! My leg... I'm screwed! I'm gonna die like a rat... Why am I still alive?! My son... dead... All because of me! I've lost everything... I want to die! What's that? No!! Not me! Not me! No! Are you the devil?! Oh no... my name's Pedro. You from the Red Cross? Has the colonel sent you? How are my men? You OK, Sir? Where were you when we were in danger? Ummm... We might have been killed! Tree, he dying! We failed too... ...to help you! End of the world! It soon be all over. Earth is sick... You're here to protect that tree, right? You've done nothing! You tell her. No, you, you big oaf! No, you're a bigger one! No, stop! Don't start arguing! Answer my question. Where were you? Us not there... So where were you? Being angry! Always fighting... Nothing to do. You have to stop fighting. It's not doing you any good at all. Idiota! Fat dummies! Zeros! Nobodies! Super nothings! Nix! Not at all! When I fell down through space... You've saved me... all of you together. You're really strong! After all, you're the Migous! Migou? What's a Migou? What is it? Me what? Me goo? With that hole in their stomach, they're not like they used to be. They've lost their memory. It's dislocated. Am I hurting you? Stop it! It's all over. You'll be OK. Let me die, Captain! Aldrin is dead, and I want to die... It would be better like that. Aldrin? Who's Aldrin? He'll get a posthumous medal. Be brave! We'll get out of here. Come and help me dig! Tell my wife that I loved her. Together, we'll go faster! Come and help me! Leave me, captain... I won't make it! You'll have more chance of getting out without me. I'll be a burden. What a pain in the neck! Listen! Order from the colonel... We both have to get out! From the colonel?! His very words! Tree dying! Tree dying! My father says, if a tree dies, it's not so bad. If there are any seeds, you can plant them. The tree lives again! "Seeds"! Are there any? -"Seeds"?.... - Yes, seeds! What are "seeds"? Look out below! Crash! Crash... It's easier through here. We're getting close to something. Wait... I'll soon see... Recognise where we are? No... never seen it. It's really getting urgent. This branch isn't normal. It looks more like the end of a root. A root? Yes, a root. That's good! But the root's in the air. They're usually underground. An upside down plant? That's impossible! If you're right about the roots being at the top... ...then the branches must be in the ground. So the seeds should be under our feet. Upside down? My God...! What is this shambles? Where are we? Underground? Above ground? What is it? Pedro! My head...! Pedro! My friend... What's the matter? - You don't look well. - I'm cold! The tree's going to die. That makes me ill. I'm freezing! I feel frozen! I'll warm you up! Any better? I'm too cold... Aldrin... Mia... Mia! Upside down? Upside down? Of course! That's it... upside down! It's coming back! I remember! This is the solution! Daddy... Daddy... Look! It's awesome! Everything's coming back as before. Yes... Except for my father, and yours, too. - Mia... - What? This is for you... It's pretty, what is it? A meteorite! A pebble from outer space. It fell into my bedroom. Take it, it's a present. Wow! Thank you. Will you put it round my neck? Ouch! Gosh...! Did I hurt you? It's alright... thank you Alvin. This is my first necklace. Where I come from, getting one makes you a woman. Look, the lake's still frozen. Shall we take advantage of it? Quick, I'm afraid it might melt! I'm coming! Wait for me! Push! Go on... push! I'm doing the best I can... Can't you see I'm stuck?! Give me a hand! Relax yourself! That's it... you're saved! - Not too shaken up, Pedro? - I'm okay. But... Oh! Oh! Mia... Papa?... Mia! Daddy? Mia! But how...? It's you! - It's me... It's you? - It's me! - Daddy? - Yes! I don't believe it... Is it a dream? - It's his kid! - His kid? You're prickly. Yes, I haven't been able to shave. Please excuse me! My little girl...! I've been looking for you everywhere. Now, here you are! You can't imagine how much I've thought of you! But you've changed, haven't you? Yes, that's it, your hair! You're a big girl now! You're so beautiful! Hey, guys... take a look! This is my daughter! My little sweetie pie! Aldrin... Can you... Can you forgive me? Without your father's help... ...I would have died. He saved me. I failed in everything with you. I ask your forgiveness. Daddy... Daddy! Oh, Daddy! My son! My little boy! Rain! Rain at last! Rain! Rain! Rain! When nothing is going well, the rain falls on my nose! Somehow or other it knows it makes me better! Whenever I really need it, those little drops of water. Even on fiesta nights, the rain is falling on me! Man knows every recipe to bring undone the planet. He owns enough stuff to reduce it to shreds. He's so powerful now that it won't take long to undo what Nature took billions of years to do. Let's cut all the bullshit, our planet's exhausted! We must stop and think, before making it worse! It's not engraved in our minds that we're all puppets! Deep inside all of us a little Migou is sleeping! Profit is always pushing men to be regulated by technology. All that is problematic, to the detriment of ethics! The forests and energy, water, sun and life... Transport and health, all stuffed in one basket! Let's cut all the bullshit, our planet's exhausted! We must stop and think, before making it worse! It's not engraved in our minds that we're all puppets! Deep inside all of us a little Migou is sleeping! How many generations remain to mankind... ...to find a wonderful solution to pollution? One or two, maybe three, it depends on us, on you! Do we want for our children, a world of fire and blood? Let's cut all the bullshit, our planet's exhausted! We must stop and think, before making it worse! It's not engraved in our minds that we're all puppets! Deep inside all of us a little Migou is sleeping! Say, Nenesse! Where the hell did you get that ace of clubs from? What do you think? I was dealt it! Impossible, I gave it to Piche! - How? - In the deal. Cheat! He looked in my cards! - Me, a cheat? - What else are you? Piche had the ace of clubs, but it was Nenesse who played it! - Do you have an explanation? - Can't say I do... - I had it, that's all! - You can't have! - It was Piche who had it! - You're starting to bug me! - Bad players! - You know what they always say... ...bad players? - The masters of the screw-up! Don't change anything, boys! When you play with us you'll have the right to criticize! Play with you?! It's not last night! Stop dreaming! Baklava, what are you gonna do about my car? - Isn't it insured? - Are you kidding? You creep! You go to... Hey, do you know what? You just have to... From me, eh? And like that, you'll have... Look at it. Subtitles by FatPlank
