I told you; don’t start what you can’t finish. How are you Dammy? How are you Baby? Make sure she’s in bed by nine. Okay.

This is a public place, and I came here to eat and I’m sure you came here to do the same thing. True. You’re funny. Well, I try. Some call me a clown. You look good. Thank you. You too. So how are you? What are you doing here all by yourself? Uh, well I just dropped my family off at the station. They’re out of town for the bank holiday. So I just decided to come have lunch, have my me time. And you? Uh, I’m a loner. So I just came here to have a meal all by myself. Okay... Hmm, I’m all yours. Can I tell you something I’ve never told anyone before? Okay. Uhm, yeah, I am a doctor. So your secret is safe with me. Yeah right. Hey. I wish I could believe you. Scout’s honour. You mention being a medical practitioner. So what branch of Medicine do you practice? I’m a surgeon – cardiovascular. Really?! Hmm, mmm. That’s impressive. Nice. So tell me, can you mend a broken heart? If it’s medically possible. But I must say, any man who breaks your heart definitely needs a psychiatrist. Just saying. You are such a charmer. I’ll take that as a compliment. Can I buy you a drink? No. Hmm, let me buy you a drink. Hmm? Okay Hello, mister? Hey well? How’re you doing? So what happened to you? How do you mean? I called you several times last night. You didn’t see them? Oh! There was an emergency at the, um, at the hospital last night. It was a nightmare honestly. I didn’t get home until 4am this morning and I’m even going back there now. So you’re pulling in straight shifts. No, no, no. That was not the plan, you know. But since there was a serious situation at hand and they needed me, so I had to be there. O no! So, how was your journey? Right. And how’s Dammy doing? She’s having the best time. Hmm, I can imagine. I guess I’ll see you tomorrow then? Okay. Bye Sweetie. Bye love. Hey Honey? Honey? Hmm, I could get used to that. Sorry, I thought it was someone else. You just know how to spoil the mood, don’t you? Anyway, what happened? I woke up and you had gone. Uhm, I didn’t want to wake you up. I had to rush up. I left you a note. What note? Right beside your bed. O, that’s nice. But I thought we were going to spend some quality time together. Sorry, I have to be at the hospital. Okay. You can swing bye afterwards. I’ll cook us some lunch. Uh, I’ll see. I’m quite tired you know. I’d rather return back to my bed after work. Well, the last time I checked, there was a bed at my place and you are always welcome. Okay. But I’m not promising anything. Thank you. See you later, Babe. Bye. Bye. Please can we reduce the Lorazepam to 4 mg and give her titrated doses of 1 mg a day? Don’t worry sir – she’s getting the best care possible. She’ll be fine. Here. Thanks. I’ll pass. Baby, aren’t you happy to see me? Linda, I’m driving. Okay? Just a glass of wine won’t hurt. I’ll have water instead, alright? Why do I even bother? Are you okay? That seems to be your favourite line, yeah? What have I done to upset you now? You just know how to spoil the mood. Fine. I’ll mix it with soft drink. You don’t have to. Fine. I am. What is it? What are you thinking? I’m just wondering why all the interests in guys are married. I guess that’s what makes them interesting the fact that they’re responsible. Responsible? Hmm mmm. So what are you doing here? You sure do know how to ask the most awkward questions. Really? I’m being real! Look, it doesn’t even matter. What matters is that I had a great weekend with you, and I’d love for us to continue seeing each other. Linda, see. I appreciate the fact that you feel this way about us, but I don’t think it’s a very good idea. Why not? Uh, well, see. This is not the best time to talk about this, alright? Let me just go home. You just got here. See, all of this is you, alright? It’s… Look, I’ve had a long day. Okay? More so, my family just got back home. I haven’t seen them. You know I… Right. So now your family is back and Linda is no longer relevant. Right? Come on. Don’t sound like that. I just told you I am tired. Okay, I understand But please stay with me a little bit longer. I have to go now. Okay. But promise you’ll call me sometime. You don’t have to if you don’t want to. I will, okay? As long as you promise that we’d assume this weekend never happened. Okay Well, bye. Take care. Okay. Hey! Daddy! How are you sweetheart? You’re good? Come here baby. How are you? We had a great time. Uncle Lawrence took us to see a movie. Now who’s Uncle Lawrence? Uncle Lawrence is Aunty Efe’s boyfriend, but not Christiana’s dad. Really? Hey! Hey Sweetheart, how are you? I’m okay. Come here, come here. Sit here. Ah! What will I ever do without you in my life? Hmm, what happened to you? Must anything happen to me before I should love my wife? O dear! Now I am worried. What have you done? Nothing. I love you. Fifteen year old boy, a major stab wound to the chest. Just came out of surgery, following recovery with Mr Rabi. But he’s been a bit unstable. His BP is going down and his PR is faster. I need vital signs every fifteen minutes, and you repeat blood test for NBC and blood gases. We may be dealing with internal bleeding here. We have to go in again. I need an update in 60 minutes. Hey girl, how did it go at court today? Stressful. It’s likely we proceed to trial. Can you imagine? Okay, sorry. I heard that Martin is returning back to the chambers. Okay. Okay? Is that all you’re going to say? What else is there to say, good luck? Really? And how do you think you’re going to cope? I’m years past that stage. I’m married, with a wonderful child and a great life. And I’m sure he’s moved on too. Okay, ‘cause from what I’ve heard, he’s been divorced for about over a year now and you never know, he might be coming back for you. He’s coming back for a new job, not for me. You don’t know that now. Do we? You never know! Girl, just give it a trial or something. You do need it right, from all the shenanigans. Who is that? I don’t know. It’s a private caller. What if it’s important? If it’s important, they would leave a message. Daddy! What do you want from my husband? Hi, Richie. Sure, sure. Hold for him, please. Hey. You left your phone unguarded. I was in the kitchen. Call waiting. E be like say Linda dey the other end of the phone. Yeah. O boy, you know something, ehn? You need to block that babe sharpaly. Na me dey tell you o. Hey Richie, can I call you back in a sec, please. Bye. Hey Sweetheart! Hey. You okay? Hmm mmm. Why don’t you just come back? Come. Hey, hey. Okay, okay my princess. Okay, okay. Let’s go. And so the princess saw the prince and they returned back to the palace - Daddy! - And they got married and they lived happily ever after Daddy, you’re reading too fast. Slow down. And they lived, and they lived happily ever after. The End. That’s the story. Eh? Good night. Night night, Daddy. Good night, Darling. You’re a very busy man tonight. Who knows maybe it’s one of your girlfriends. I hope they know that you’re married. And how do you know? And maybe if you had answered the call, then you would have known which one of the girls called. Hey Baby, why don’t you leave this till tomorrow? You know I can offer you something more exciting. In a sec. Hey, hey, hey. Baby. Come on, Baby. I’m really tired. Honey, come on, I’m really tired. Come on, Babe. You know Dammy is old enough to have a brother. Baby, I thought we agreed it wasn’t happening until I was made QC. Uh, okay. What’s that? What’s that sound? Please, come, come come o! What’s happening? Okay, his BP is low, he’s going into shock Please us get you out. - Please. He is my only child. - We will give him the best care we get. I know. We will. We will take care of him. We do need space to work. Hello! The number you have dialled cannot be recognised. Please hang up and try again. Are you stalking me? No. But a hello would have been nice. Well, hello. I’ve been meaning to call you though. Really? Pray tell – how were you going to do that? Call you on mobile phone of course. Have you changed your number? Stop with the pretence, Shola. What are you talking about? You blocked my number. Didn’t you? Why would I do that? It probably was poor reception. You can do better than what you’re saying. Linda, I’ve told you it’s over between us, okay? Just stop calling me, stop stalking me, alright? So have a good day. I wonder how your wife will feel if she finds out about your little secret affair. Are you threatening me? No, I’m just saying. You dare not. I don’t know what she wants. Look. This girl - I think she loves you. And she just needs that sweet, romantic, loving care. You think this is funny? Come, come, come. So na dis issue dey come make you serious like say you wan deliver budget? Ehn? Dis tin no be budget. And if you dey fear say maybe the girl na tiger, calm down, try see am first na make you know wetin she dey talk. The last time we had a conversation, she said she wanted us to meet So why you come dey fear? Tell me, why you dey fear? Well, if you’re so scared, let it be in the public. She no fit eat you na. Na you now, Docky. I no know why you fear like dis o. Why are you acting like a pussy? It’s just a girl. Dis girl no be lion na, she no fit tear you. Wetin dey do you na? Calm down. Sholay! You con dey behave like say you don sick. It’s over, there’s nothing between us. You mean you’ve had your fun and you want to live a quiet life. Right? Well, I’m not going anywhere, so get used to it. Why are you doing this? Doing what? What do you want from me? You don’t have to be hostile, Shola. It’s not necessary. Look, I’m not your enemy here. Then why are you trying to hurt me? Hurt you? Babe, I love you. You what? I love you. You don’t even know me, Linda. How can you even say that? We spent the weekend together. That’s as far as it goes But you enjoyed it, didn’t you? Babe, look. I honestly believe you feel something special for me. I do. O my goodness. Ugh, so this is what all of it is about. This is why you wanted us to see. Our imaginary love affair? I’m pregnant. No, you can’t be, Linda. Yes, I am. Then how do you know it’s mine? Eh, because I don’t sleep around. Sorry, I didn’t know this is why you wanted us to see. So don’t worry, I won’t let you handle it alone, okay? Handle? What? What makes you think I’m going to have an abortion? Come on, you can’t keep the baby, Linda. Why not? This is England. Successful single parents are quite common here. Wait – don’t I have a say in this? I want this baby. It’s my choice. Then why on earth are you telling me? Well, I was hoping you’d want to be a part of it. O men, this is crazy. This is absolutely crazy. That’s my decision. Linda, are you listening to yourself? I mean think about what you’re saying? This will affect both our lives. You think I haven’t thought about that, Shola? Look, I understand how you feel. It’s a big thing, yes. But it doesn’t have to be your problem. Play fair with me Shola, and I will play fair with you. Door opening. Hi. Hello. You still working on the case? Hmm mmm. How can I help you? Door closing. I was thinking, maybe you could join me for lunch. I have so much on my table at the moment. I can see that. How about a drink after work? Unfortunately, I’m going to have to pass. It’s not a big deal. It’s just two colleagues having a drink after work. Martin, I’m a married woman now. I’d appreciate if you forget about the past. And I’m sure you’d just seduce a new graduate as usual. I was an idiot, Adesuwa. I’ve been terrible. I’ve never been able to forgive myself ever since. You are my sunshine, little one. You are the world to me. And every day is magical when it is shared with you. I love the gift you give me and the silly games we play. Your smiles and giggles hold my heart more than words can say. Hey Darling. Hey! Uhh, there’s something I want to… Is everything okay? What is the matter? I’ve just been on the on the phone for the last hour with Jane. She found out that Chris is having an affair with a neighbour. Been going on for the last year and a half. Chris? I mean… really? Yeah. I can’t even believe. They seemed so devoted to each other and the church. How did she find out? The woman is pregnant. Jane found the messages on Chris’s phone, so he couldn’t deny it. Whoa, this is tough. Tough? It's a disaster. If it was me… Baby, you know I’m different. You know I won’t cheat on you. I know. Chris is an idiot. Come on. I mean… uhh. Babe, uh.. Just uh... Say by mistake, you know, I-I-I did something like that, I mean, something like that happens to me – I’m just saying… I trust you. Let’s leave it at that. And remember I’m a barrister. Yeah. So, what did you want to tell me? Oh, nothing… Something silly at work. Don’t bother about it, okay? Uhm, about Carly Williamson versus Suraganda? Subranadan. Oh yes, I got your memo on that one. Uh, so you’re going for summary judgment? Why not? The facts are not in dispute. Williamson already agreed to the claim and the plaintiff preferred her own plea. Okay, I’m trusting you on this decision. Hmm? Martin doesn’t give up, does he? Look, if you go dey take dis tin too serious, believe me, e go turn to something else o. Oooh Richie. I dey tell you di truth O Babe, can you wait for me in the room? He’s very cute. I’m married. Yeah, whatever. Come joor. Why is she still pregnant? Didn’t you use protection? I didn’t plan this, okay? You know how these things are – I was drunk. Come on men, come on. Sholay, na three different occasions na hin we dey yan o. You dey try tell me say you no use rubber all the time wey you dey cane dis babe. This is not funny, don’t laugh. No be laughing matter. I no dey laugh, I no dey laugh here. But now tell me, why’s she still pregnant. Because she refused to have an abortion. Will I force her? I go force am? Have you done a scan? Yes. Sholay, you be doctor o. You tink dis tin dey legal? Guy, I don check am, e dey di tin. You know what? Maybe if she realises that you don’t that much of interest in her, she’ll get rid of the pregnancy. Because all along, she just feels that you’re gonna marry her. What do you think? This is crazy. Yeah, it is. It’s really, really crazy. But I’ll suggest you stop this volcano erupting. That man is a deacon in my church… Shameless man, taking his girlfriend to the salon. Why do all men cheat? I wouldn’t say all men, some are still clean, you know. They are all the same. I think it’s in their gene. I still believe there are some good men. Please, when you see one, let me know. You shouldn’t stereotype. Stereotype? So the likes of Ashley Cole, Tiger Woods and the rest of them? Please, mention one that is clean. Like my ex-boyfriend who impregnated my best friend? That’s you all done now. Thank you. Pay over there. Hi, Mrs Daniels. I love your hair. O, thank you. Do you come here regularly? Someone recommended this place to me. You don’t seem to recognise me. I’m sorry, I– We met ages ago at one of your work dos. Your firm represented my company back then. - Yes! - O, really? I’m so sorry. It's okay, it’s alright. O, how are you. How is your little daughter? She’s fine, thank you. She must be a big girl now. Yeah, she is Hey, do you guys accept card payment here? No, sorry. There’s an ATM down the road though. No? O my! Alright then, thank you. Nice to meet you again, Mrs Daniels. You too. Take care. Whose phone is this? Uh, hello? Hello, good afternoon. Uh, hello. Afternoon? You have my phone. Uh well, it certainly isn’t mine, and it just started ringing. Hmm, and I think I have yours too. I was calling from a phone I found in my bag. I don’t understand. Mrs Daniels? Yeah – hum, please, who am I speaking to? Linda, Linda Bruce. We met earlier. O, the lady from the salon! Yes! O, I’m terribly sorry. I don’t know how I got hold of your phone. It’s okay. I guess it’s just a mix up because both phones look alike. Okay, um, are you still at the salon? Where do you want us to meet? No, I’ve left. Where are you now? O sorry, I’m back home now. Right, is that nearby? Yeah, so I can come meet you outside the salon? No, there’s no need to trouble yourself. I can sweep by now if you text me the address. O, thank you. That’d be great. Uhm, I can text you my address. Good. You mean you’d text yourself the address? Yeah. I'll see you shortly. Okay, bye. I was saying which side are you from? I am from here. O really! Okay. Yeah. So tell me, did you…. O, hi Honey. This is Linda. I’m sorry, I keep forgetting your last name. Bruce. Linda Bruce. Linda Bruce. My husband, Adeshola. A brilliant surgeon, glad to finally meet you. My pleasure. Haven’t we met before? Your face looks so familiar No, I don’t think so. I’m not sure either. Linda came to collect her phone. I mistakenly took hers from the hair salon. O, did you? Yeah, just a slight mix up. O, she’s also related to my boss. O, excuse me please. Goodness! I have to run. Thank you so much. I’m so, so sorry for the inconvenience It’s alright, do take care and nice meeting you. I knew you’d come once you saw what you were missing. How dare you? What would you like to drink? I’ve got red wine, I’ve got vodka, I’ve got some homemade… Hey, hey, hey, look at me! Cut the bullshit, okay! I know what game you’re playing at. But I’m going to tell you it stops here and now. No, it’s not going to stop. It’s going to continue until you accept your responsibilities. What responsibilities? What are you talking about? My pregnancy. I’m carrying our child. Linda, that is your choice and not mine. Baby, am I asking for too much here? I just want to be a tiny part of your life. And this is how you go about it; showing up at my house? I didn’t know it was your house. I just went to get my phone. O your phone. You’re sick you know. How did your phone show up in my house? Is that why you’re here – to talk about phone? You don’t just get it, do you? Get what? Have you forgotten all the things you said to me that night? Why can’t we be that way again? I know you still want me, but you’re just so scared of her. Why? Is she the stumbling block? Or is it because she’s a lawyer? Don’t flatter yourself. Poor little Adesuwa. God. I bet she won’t be able to handle it once she finds out her husband’s heart belongs to someone else. I’m warning you, keep my wife out of this. Or what? What will you do? Hit me? If you like the serve thing, I’m game. You need help. Don’t pity me, you smug bastard. O yes, I pity you, ‘cause you lack cognitive reasoning abilities. Why? Because I won’t let you bang me around a few times and dump me? Is that why? Look, I deserve some respect too. I am carrying our child. You want respect, uh? Shola, where’re you going? Shola, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it, I was just joking. We’ll do it. You know it’s for the best. Sorry, I’ve been a bit selfish and inconsiderate. It’s just that the way things have just– It’s not your fault. I should have known better. Yes, it’s my fault. You know, I shouldn’t have come here in the first instance. I know it’s so much for you. Can you find in your heart to forgive me? Truly I’m sorry. There’s nothing to forgive. Then what would you have me do? Go. Go home, to your family. I would like to cover the expenses. Don’t worry. I’ll take care of myself. Please, let me foot the bills. Okay, fine. If you insist. I do I’ve already made an appointment at the hospital, so pick me up on Friday by 3pm. Wait, wait, wait. Do I have to come with you? I thought I’d just give you the cash. I already told you to go – that I’d take care of myself, but you insisted on helping. So Friday 3pm, pick me up. Honey, are you awake? Yes, can’t sleep. Got something on your mind? It’s nothing important, don’t bother about it. Well, I’ve been thinking. Do you remember the promise I made you? Yeah. Well, I’m QC now. Ouch! Sorry, sorry. Would you want me to kiss the pain? Something wrong? I’m sorry, Babe. No, thanks. Rich is brown, Adesuwa for taking silk. Now a QC. How about that drink? Thanks, but no drinks on me. I need to go home to cook dinner. Come on. Just one drink. Okay, just one. Be with him in the mighty name of Jesus. Don’t take my child away, O Lord. He’s my only child. Uh. Alright. Get some rest, alright. You’ll feel better after. I’ll stay here for a while. You don’t have to. I’m fine now. It’s alright. I’ll stay. I didn’t know how traumatic the procedure would be. You’re a doctor, you should know. I’ll be in the living room if you need me, okay? Thanks Babe for being so kind. Get some sleep, okay? Okay. What is it? You still need to rest. Babe, I missed you. Thanks for everything. What are friends for? You mean that? What? That we’re friends. It’s my birthday on Sunday. I’ve made reservations for two at the Ledbury. So pick me up at 6.30pm Uh, and unfortunately I have an engagement that evening. Well, this is also important. This is your baby’s birthday we’re talking about here. See Linda, under a different circumstance… Don’t explain because you really don’t have any choice. Not for doing your way out and putting the keys back in. See you on Sunday, Baby. You owe me. You know I’ve never seen you this relaxed in months. Says a man who is always on call. I’m very happy to have the most beautiful and understanding woman as my wife. See, and here’s to another blissful year of marriage, Madam QC. Who is it? It’s a private caller. What if it’s important? There’s nothing as important as spending this beautiful day with my sweetheart. Come here. Hello Who is it? A private number So, where were we? Come here Hello. Hello, may I speak to Doctor Daniels, please? Who is this, please? A friend. Who is this? At last... How may I help you, please? I just want to hear your voice. Hey, I thought… Honey, please. I did not call you to pick a fight with you, please. Don’t worry, after today, I’d be out of your way. Um, what do you mean? I see you haven’t read my messages. I just want to be happy. I’ve never considered myself a lucky girl. Just lonely, rejected, abandoned. And then I met you, Shola. Linda, I hope this is not what– Maybe in another lifetime… happy anniversary. Linda, Linda. - Are you there? - Hey! Doctor Olushola. Hey Sir! What are you doing here? I’m doing very well. Well, it’s my tenth anniversary. Congratulations! Thank you so much. And once again, congratulations on your wife becoming a QC. Well, it’s been a long time coming. Anyway, meet George Ruddock, he’s the CEO of The Voice Newspaper, the best black newspaper in the UK. How are you? I’m doing well sir. Thank you very much sir. Good, good. Where is she? Ah, this way. Adesuwa is seated over there. Okay. I’ll see you. I’ll be okay here. Yeah, okay. Hallo, hallo. Please can I, can I get an ambulance. Uh gosh, uh – some Flat 42, hmm, damn. It’s uh, okay. Sir, I know the apartment but I can’t remember the address. It’s um, it’s Cricklewood Lane, off the North Circular, it’s… I think it’s NW2 – 42. She had a 7-week termination 2 days ago. Alright, thank you. What’s going on? Is it that the same Linda that came to our house? Is there something you’re not telling me? Can we just get into the car and I will explain? You get into the car, I’ll get a taxi home. Adesuwa please. Just go. How can I help you, sir? How’s she, I mean Linda Bruce? That was her in the ambulance, right? Are you a relative sir? Ma, I was actually the one who called 999. She called me and said she had taken an overdose. What’s your name, sir? And what’s your relationship to her? I’m Doctor Olushola, I’m uh, I’m her doctor. Doctor uhm – can you spell your first name for me, please? It’s uhm, it’s…. Are you the fellow whose name she kept calling out when the paramedics resuscitated her? Um…. Yeah. How could you let this happen? The last thing I want to do is hurt you, Adesuwa. Sure, you just wanted to sleep around. Getting her pregnant, an abortion. Do you love her? Of course not. It was just a night and it meant nothing. Nothing? Is this about you wanting another child? Come on, no. It was a mistake. Please, stay away from me. Adesuwa, please. Get out. I just want you to leave me alone. But just listen to me, please. How can I trust anything you have to say? What kind of a man are you? I don’t even know who you are anymore. Just leave us alone. I hate you. You disgust me. I don’t want you here, do you understand? Um, o my God! Baby, let’s go to your room. Adesuwa, please. Please, I’m sorry. Adesuwa, please don’t do this. I need to be alone, so please get out of my house. And go where? To hell. Miss Bruce, I’m Nitasha Bantley and with me is PC Rodriguez. May I have a word with you? Sure, please come in. I’m sorry I’m such a mess, but they wouldn’t let me take a shower or at least even wash my hair. Apparently, I’m still on suicide watch. Yes, madam you are. You were in such a terrible state. Having your stomach pumped must have been fun, eh? Hopefully, you won’t be trying anything so silly again. How do you feel? Well, I still feel a bit groggy. I guess it’s the medication. Otherwise I’m fine besides feeling ashamed for all the troubles I’ve caused. Would you like to discuss the incident that led you here? I need my phone. I’d like to contact my private doctor, please. Would that be Doctor, um, Olushola Daniels? I’m afraid that won’t be possible. I talked to Doctor Daniels outside your apartment. We had a very long chat about you, we did. He came! My suggestion is that you find yourself another private doctor. He saved your life. Now you return the favour and leave him and his family alone, won’t you? You’ve already caused him a great deal of trouble. I thought everyone had gone. No, I couldn’t go. Baby, you’re crying. I’m not crying, I’m fine. And please, only address me by my name. He cheated on me. Really? Listen to me, I’m here for you. I’m not going to let you go through this on your own. It’s going to be fine. Hello Doctor. This is David, the boy that you saved his life at the hospital. My mum gave me your number because she wanted me to say how thankful we were and how grateful we were that you could keep me in this world again, and that helped me breathe another day. And my family and I, we’re very thankful for what you have done… Leave it Hello. Hi Honey. Daddy, when are you coming back home? I don’t know, but soon. Daddy, are you leaving us for another woman? No, no, no. How can I do such a thing? Who said that to you? No one. So how are you doing? Fine. And mummy? Dad says how are you doing? Fine. She said she’s fine. Alright, dad sends you lots of love. Both of you. Okay, Daddy, will you pick me up tomorrow? I promise, and don’t forget to tell mummy I send her lots of love. I won’t. And bye now, dear. Bye.
