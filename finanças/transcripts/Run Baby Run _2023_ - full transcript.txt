Who knows? [screams] Hey! It's Sophia. Sophi… Sophi… Sophi… SOPHIA… -I want to see earrings. -Earrings? Have a seat. -Hey, did you check this side? -Yes, I did. No one's here. -You? -No! -Go to your left and check. Go! -Okay, brother! -What happened? -No… -Any luck? -No… -Hey… -[gasps] -Who the hell are you? -Damn! -You moron… -Get lost! Hey… What are you doing? What? What is it? What is it? Shut up and get lost! ♪♪♪ ♪ You… ♪ ♪ Are the dream… I see! ♪ ♪ You… ♪ ♪ Are the question… I search for! ♪ ♪ You're the shore! ♪ ♪ I'm the wave! ♪ ♪ I caress you! ♪ ♪ Like bubbles, my memory ♪ Why are you staring at me? Actually, I can't believe my own eyes! The fact that you accepted my proposal, makes me wonder! The boyfriends I had till now… The groom sought by my parents… No one works for the bank. Someone who works for the bank is special. That's why! So… did you accept only because of my job? [chuckles] I was joking! Where's my gift? Okay, take it out! Why are you searching? Actually… I'm more excited to know your taste than the gift itself. Where is it? Here… [chuckles] Wow… earrings? Why did you think of buying this? I felt you would look pretty if you wear this. It's beautiful! My parents will love this more than I do. See… "Groom who's employed at the bank… is gifting you with gold. How responsible!" is what they'll say. Even I like it! You have good taste! Shall we head home after a while? I have a Zoom meeting at the bank this evening. I need to go! Shall we go for a drive tomorrow on your birthday, please? Okay… -Alright… See you tomorrow! -Okay, bye! -Bye! -Ask him to come in. -Good evening, Sathya! -Hello, Uncle! -Come in! -I'm running late, Uncle. I need to go! What's going to happen in five minutes? Have a cup of coffee. I have a Zoom meeting at the office, Aunty! -I'm already late. -Sathya… a small favor! I've given my car for service. And we need to attend a function this evening. It would be really helpful if you can leave your car. I'll bring the car to your house tomorrow before you leave for the office. -I'll drop Sathya and be back. -Okay, bye! Bye, Sathya! How is your mom? She's fine! How often do you visit her? -Once in two weeks. -You must be busy. Working at a bank is stressful! Won't they make you work even after the office hours are over? -Yes, Uncle! -[chuckles] It's always a one-word answer from you! Yes, no… I pity Priyanka! Hello… I'm leaving. -Uncle… -I'll be there in half an hour. -Unc-- -Is Sekar coming? Sathya… See you in the morning! No, no! I was talking here! Is it? Oh God! Hello… who the hell are you? Why did you get into my car? Sir… Sir… Sorry, sir. Please don't shout! I'm caught in a big problem, sir! I was chased by many men. I didn't know where to go. That's why I got into your car, sir! I thought I'll apologize after traveling some distance and get down. But… your… that girl… Then her father… got in one after the other, sir. I thought it might become a problem if I talked. So I stayed silent. Do you think I'll believe your story? Why would you get into my car if someone is chasing you? Sir… I'm telling the truth, I swear! I have no other intention. No, right? Just leave, please! Leave! I'll get into trouble if someone sees you here. Leave now. Lobby is that way. Get going, please! Hello, what the hell are you doing? -The main gate is that way. -Sir… sir… One minute, sir. I just need a small help. Please, sir! What is it? My mobile got switched off. I need to charge it for five minutes. If you want to charge your phone, go to the security room at the main gate. Why are you coming behind me? Sir… I cannot go there because of my current situation. Please understand, sir! I don't know who you are or what your problem is. Should I also get into trouble trying to help you? Just five minutes, sir. I'll charge my mobile and leave, sir! -Not happening! -Sir, sir. Please, sir! Just five minutes. Sir, sir. Please, sir! Sir… I just got engaged. I cannot take another girl to my house. Leave now. Sir, someone will come to pick me up only if I charge my phone and call. I already told you, sir. I'm caught in a big problem! Help me, sir. Please, sir! Sir… Sir… Please understand! Just five minutes! You can charge your phone there. Sir… -Can I get some water to drink? -It's over there. I'll help myself! Sir… Can I make a call? Sir… just one thing. What is it? Sir… Didn't I say someone will pick me up if I call? Looks like it'll take an hour for him to get here. Hey… what are you thinking? You got into my car… You said you wanted to charge your mobile for just five minutes… I took pity and agreed to that. But now you're saying it'll take another hour! I cannot help you anymore. Leave now. Get out. I cannot do anything. Get going, I cannot do anything more! Sir, I cannot go alone in this situation. What big situation are you in? If it's not safe, go to the police. Sir, I cannot talk to anyone about my situation. Please understand, sir! Enough of this. Now leave! I have understood enough. Just go! -Sir… -You please leave! -Sir… Please… -Hello, will you leave now or… shall I call the police? Leave… -Sir… -What? I'm leaving now. But if I'm lying dead on the streets… Don't feel bad seeing the news tomorrow. Why are you doing this? I'm an ordinary man. I'll only think of not getting myself into any unnecessary trouble. Without knowing who you are, or what your problem is, how can I-- Sir, I'm not in a state to open up about that problem. Please try to understand! Sir, please… Who's coming to pick you up? My guardian is coming, sir. Come in! Your guardian… Will he surely come in an hour? He won't be late, right? I told you he'll be here in an hour only because you'll get angry. Actually, it'll take more than two hours for him to reach here. You'll not get into any trouble because of me, sir! Trust me, please! The guest room is that way. If it's okay, be there! Thank you, sir! To your left… And… what's your name? Thara! [prayers playing] I'm going to eat. Do you want to eat? No… I'm not hungry. I don't want anything. Are you sure? Sure, sir. Alright, I have an office Zoom meeting. Suppose your guardian comes before I'm done… You don't have to tell me. You can just leave. Okay, sir! Thanks! Brother… Brother! The main door was open. I thought you had already woken up! Okay, brother! I'll bring you some tea. -Good morning, Sathya! -Hello, Uncle! Please come in. Did you sleep well? Oh yes, I did! I'm coming here straight after finishing my jog. -Did I come on time? -I still have time, Uncle. It's okay. -You please sit. I'll get ready. -Okay! -Ma'am… -Brother? -Make it two teas, one for uncle. -Okay, brother! -Less sugar, please. -Okay, sir! -How did the function go, Uncle? -It went fine! Remote… Uncle, remote! -You can watch TV while I get ready. -I'll manage! [panting heavily] Who else lives here? This is my son-in-law's house. That's him, Sathya! He's working at a bank. Do you live here alone? -Yes, sir. -She's Saraswathi. She's the maid. Why are you all stunned and speechless? A drunkard kept calling over and over last night. He said there's some big problem at your apartment. Most of these calls turn out to be fake. But I thought I'd check in person anyway. What's the problem here? Sir… we know it's probably just a hoax. But it's our duty to check in person. -Hey… you go and check inside. -Sir? Sir… why… Sir, it's nothing but a formality. -You go. Go and check. -Okay, sir! Sir… the neighbors will jump to conclusions if they see the police at our house. Sir… name one apartment where people care about their neighbors. Maybe I'll inform the lobby that there's no problem when I leave. This is nothing, sir! I've checked, sir. There's nothing! -I've checked all the rooms. No problem! -Okay! -No one's there, sir. -That's it. It was just a formality. Okay… -Sir, are you in charge? -Yes, sir. That's me. Come along! -Sir, that's him! -Greetings, sir! Where's the CCTV control room? -This way, sir. -Lead the way. Sir… -What's this? -Sir, I really don't know what happened. Who was on duty last night? -It was me, sir! -How irresponsible of you! I need all the footage right away. Okay, sir! Brother, I've left everything as it is. Maybe I'll leave after finishing all the work. -It's alright. You can finish it up tomorrow. -Really? -Okay, brother. -The lift is here. The police has been here. It wouldn't be right to leave her alone, Uncle! Makes sense! -Let's not tell Priyanka about this. -Okay! Is it? Okay! -Wouldn't we be able to see the footage? -Let's see. We'll know once the technician is here. The technician is saying backup is not possible because it's melted completely, sir. That's not acceptable. I need to know what happened last night. I don't care who you'll bring in. I need the complete back up! -Got it? Make it fast. -Yes, sir. Okay! -Okay, Sathya. Bye! -Bye, Uncle! -What have you done? -Hey… I… I didn't do anything. I called you a million times to inform you I'm coming to your house. -Why was your phone switched off? -I really don't know. I didn't check. You better spill the truth. What happened? I was chased by many men. That's why I got into your car. Someone will come to pick me up only if I call. Do you think anyone would buy this story? Sathya… I hope you aren't hiding anything from me. I swear this is what happened. Do you realize what would have happened to you if someone else had entered that room? You'd be inside the prison by now. Someone has intentionally burnt the CCTV footage with acid. If the police had come to your flat so early in the morning… It means there's someone behind all this. Then, I'll tell everything to the police. Even I'm police… And your friend. Even I'm not able to believe your story. Do you think they'll believe it? They'll arrest you! What do you suggest I do now? -Get rid of that body. -What are you saying?! Why should I? I didn't do anything wrong. I won't do it! I'm advising you as a policeman. This is the only option you got. You're making it sound so easy! -I can't, I can't. I won't do it! -You have to do it! Not just for you, but for me too. Even I've committed a crime. I searched your house and said I found nothing. I'll lose both my job and my family! Hey… Are you sure about this? -The police-- -HEY… Shut up and do what I say! -Hi! When are you coming? -A small problem cropped up at work. -I couldn't call you. -What happened? Nothing, I'll call you later. Bye! I'm leaving now. But if I'm lying dead on the streets… Don't feel bad seeing the news tomorrow. I'm advising you as a policeman. It means there's someone behind all this. Bury that corpse in the farm at your native. That's your safe bet! [chuckles] You were the one who said it. But now you're twisting the tale. -Hello? -Hey, hi! Sorry! We had a problem at the office. The server crashed. -Extremely sorry! -It's okay! But… can't you even wish me? Oh, sorry! Sorry! Happy birthday! I'm having to ask for your wishes! Don't stress yourself. I'll handle it here. Thank you! Thank you so much! -I'll call you back once things are sorted. Bye! -Bye! Brother… -Is there a mechanic shed nearby? -There's one, sir. Second building if you take the right. Make it quick, though. Okay, thanks! -Villupuram, Villupuram… -Gingee, Gingee… Brother, come on. We're going to Villupuram. Hop on! Villupuram, Villupuram… Sir? Sir… -What is it? -My car broke down at the junction. Please come and check it! My boys aren't here. They've all gone back home. Sir, I need to go urgently. Please help me. I need to get drunk. If it gets late I'll have to buy it illegally. Sir… Please… The diesel tube has been cut. Looks like someone has intentionally cut it. We need to change the tube. And it'll be morning by then. Sir, I need to go tonight. Please find a way to fix it immediately. Sir, how will we get a tube when even alcohol won't be available? Where do you have to go? -Gingee… -Gingee? Give me your phone number. I'll give you a call once the car is ready. -Hey, Muthu… -Brother? -Get sir's phone number and key. -Okay, brother! -Sir, can you try to… -It's not possible, sir. We won't get anything at this hour. I'll get it ready in the morning. Relax, sir. I'll take care! -Have you started? -Car… My car broke down near Madurantakam. -It'll get ready only by morning. -Hey… Can't you have your car serviced properly? That mechanic says the diesel tube has been cut intentionally. -What are you planning to do now? -I really don't know. I'm scared! How will I go from here? -I won't even find a taxi at this hour. -Taxi? Don't you know the problem that'll creep in when you hire a taxi? -Gingee… Gingee… -Taking a taxi will lead to problems. Brother, Gingee… Gingee, Gingee… -I… I'll call you back. -Hey… Sir… car key? No need. -Hey, Saravana. How are you? -I'm fine, brother. Get in! Gingee, Gingee, Gingee… The van will wait only for ten more minutes. Get in! Last bus. You won't be able to travel after this. Gingee, Gingee… Gingee, Gingee… Gingee, brother… -Brother… -What is it? -Heading to Gingee, right? -Yes… Get in, sister! Gingee, Gingee, Gingee… Get in, get in! Sit down! Are you traveling to Gingee? Gingee, brother. Gingee, Gingee, Gingee… -Is this van going to Gingee? -Yes, brother. Sit down! -Going via Villupuram, right? -Yes, brother! Hey, come here! -What? -Board passengers like this. Brother, please! Don't ruin my living! -Gingee, Gingee, Gingee… -I thought I'll have some fun. Did you really get in to travel to Gingee? Gingee, Gingee, Gingee… -Gingee, brother… -Are the seats full? We can leave if we have two more passengers, brother! It's getting late! -Here, you leave. -Bye, brother! Vinod, come, come! Brother, stop. One minute. -Gingee, right? -Yes, brother. -Get in, get in! -Come on, get in! Thank God, they're leaving before I start puking. We'll stop at Gingee main and not go into the town. Why?

You go in. -Come soon. We need to eat. -Alright, Mom! What happened?! -Mom! -What happened? -Mom! -What happened? There's something inside that suitcase, Mom. What do you mean?! Don't scream, Mom! -Don't shout. -[lady sobs] Someone might see us. Stay quiet and don't scream, Mom. What was that? Call the police! Don't worry, let's take care of it. -I'm getting scared, son! -Listen, you go in. -Come in. -Inform the police or else we'll be in trouble. Things might get ugly if we involve the police. Dear? Dear… When did you come? I came late in the night, Mom. I took a tablet and slept last night. I didn't notice you coming. I made some tea. Have it. Why did you have to do this? Didn't that lady come? She didn't. God knows where she went. She didn't inform me either. Also… Where's your car? It's under repair. I came by bus. Oh, is it… -Where were you? -On the way, there were a lot of police! -And that's why I was late. -Why? They found someone murdered and burnt. Where? At the cemetery. I'll be right back, Mom. -Where are you off to? -I'll be back! Move back, ladies! What an unruly crowd! The burnt corpse is of a girl. Only the legs aren't charred. The anklets are melted. Only when the detailed lab reports come, can I explain further. A rexine bag was also burnt along with the corpse. Tell me clearly. Did you accidentally burn a female body when you were drunk? I don't drink when I burn pyres, sir. Even yesterday I got drunk only after I was sure Ganesan's pyre went out. When I woke up this morning, a dog was chewing on something. When I went to check what it was, it was two human legs! And that is why I reached out to you. Sir… We've found a wheel and a handle of a bag. And there are tracks of an object being dragged. -Bring the dog here. -Okay, sir. Sir. Move, people! Nobody come close. Get behind, everyone! Ask them to give way. And to move. Disperse the crowd! Take the dog there. Remove the sheets. -Whose is this? -This is ours, sir! If this is yours, who rides it? My… My son! Where's your son? -He's here, sir! -As in? Inside the house! What's he up to when there's so much happening outside? He's resting due to a headache, sir. -What? -Yes. -Hey, get the keys. -Yes, sir. Bring the keys, lady! -Open up the boot. -Sir! A rexine bag was also burnt along with the corpse. Hey, get him! -Sir! -Move forward! We didn't do anything, sir! Please, sir! -Sir, please! -Where is your son?! -Sir, we're innocent! -Open the door! Take them away. I'm telling you sir, we're innocent! -Why are you at my house, sir? -Hey. Open up the door! -[indistinct chatter] -Open the door! I'm warning you! -Hold on! -Hey! Open the damn door! Break open the damn door! Look at the crowd getting close. Can't you listen? What is it? Break open that door and enter. Sir, we know nothing! Why are you entering our house? Stop, lady! Sir! Stop right there. -Let go of me! -Listen to us-- Get her. How could you leave your mother alone? Why did you do this… [sobs] Sathya! Hello? The incidents that happened these past two days, has now come to an end with the death of that guy. That driver killed Thara. When the police drew closer to him, he hung himself out of shame. Case closed. Hasn't your wedding been fixed? Marry her and lead a peaceful life. If you try to act like a detective and follow me, then you… will be next! Sir. These are the documents that are to be sent to the court, sir. We have no idea who the dead girl is. How will you produce this in court? This case doesn't match with any missing cases. Information regarding this case has been sent to every station. We still don't have any news. The accused is dead and the victim remains unidentified! What will you do if it becomes a problem at the court? We'll prevent that from happening. We'll submit Vinod's suicide report and tell them that the investigation is still going on. The Public Prosecutor has also been informed. Our higher officials are telling us to not investigate the case further. Okay. Go ahead. Okay, sir. You've landed yourself in a soup for helping out a stranger! If he's threatening you despite everything that has happened… He's no ordinary person! Listen to him. Don't get yourself involved in anything anymore. He has committed two murders. One where a girl died at my own house. He has pushed an innocent man to suicide. I feel guilty and responsible for what happened! He's out there threatening me despite committing all those crimes… -…but I should stay quiet, is it? -Then go! Go be a hero! Judging by the way he framed all of this, that guy is very dangerous. Let this go and save yourself! Ma'am? Ma'am? We closed your son's case today. While closing the case file… You and your son kept popping up in my head. If there's anything that you know regarding this case… …please let me know. Even if the whole town calls my son a murderer… I know… My son is innocent. What's the point of lying about it now? Will my dead son come back alive? People who visited that day came to the conclusion that we are murderers. But, no one knows… …what really happened that day. After seeing a dead body inside that bag, my insides were trembling in fear. I told him that things will get ugly if the police get involved and asked him what happened. He said that the bag belongs to one of the five people who got into the car. There were five people in the car? Yes, sir. I have warned that guy several times, sir. I let him go with a fine when I caught him the other day. -But there was a girl inside that car. -What would be her age? She should be around 28 or 29. Did you get any details from her? -We thought it wouldn't become a bigger issue… -You thought it wouldn't become a bigger issue? Did you decide that yourself? If you want to keep your job… …I need to see the details of those five people. -Understood? -Yes, sir. Where does his pick-up start? From Madurantakam. -Do you know the guy who committed suicide, Vinod? -Yes, sir. Who loads the passengers for his vehicle? -He's there. -Him? -Yes, sir. -What's his name? Saravanan. You! -Sir… -Are you Saravanan? Yes, sir. Do you know Vinod? Vinod… The guy who committed suicide. Yes. I know him, sir. Don't be scared. Just tell me what happened that day. How are you? -Heading to Gingee, right? -Yes… Get in, sister! -Yes, Gingee. -Going via Villupuram, right? Do you know any of the passengers from that day? I know one of them, sir. Tindivanam is nearby, isn't it? Why did you go to Madurantakam? My brother-in-law has a shop there, sir. The prices are cheaper there. Do you know any of the four people from that car the other day? I don't know any of them, sir. But, that day… Did it become an issue, sir? -How do you know him? -He works at the sugar factory with my nephew, sir. He's a drunkard! I don't know any of them, sir. He said that you got drunk and caused problems. Sir! When did he see me? He was clicking shady pictures and was trying to show off in front of her, sir. I put him in his place. He got pissed and that's why this hunk complained about me to you. -Sir! He's bluffing. -Give me the phone. Unlock it. Here, sir. You can be arrested not only on suspicion but also under POCSO! I did it for fun, sir. Step away! STEP AWAY! Sir… Is this the girl? Sir! She is the one. -What did you do to this girl? -Sir… I'm not that kind of a person. I'm not capable of doing big crimes. Who is this? Excuse me, sir. -Do you know him? -You again? Did you go to Ginjee with him last Friday? -Yes, sir. What-- -Ramya! -Would like some coffee? -This guy…? Sir! Aren't you ashamed? Will you react in the same way if someone did this with your wife? You are educated and in a good position, aren't you? Do your actions reflect that? Someone has murdered a girl. We're clueless and in the middle of that investigation. If this continues, we'd be searching for you, one day. Give your name and your contact to the SI. Hey! You should come when you're called. Leave! Have you given your details? Yes, I have, sir. When did you pick up your vehicle from the workshop? That… I picked up my vehicle the next day evening. Is there anything else you want to say? No, sir. Okay, you may leave now. You should come when you're called. Sir! You got our details, haven't you? Can I leave now? HEY! SHUT UP! So where did you get the bag that you threw away in the pit? Dear God! Sir! What are you talking about? I don't know anything, sir. I'm innocent. Please let me go. [phone rings] -Hello? -Did you leave the station? -Yes. -Where are you now? -I'm near Singaperumalkovil. -Come home soon. I need to talk to you. It's urgent! -Why? What happened? -Come home. I'll tell you. Okay. Bye. HEY! HEY! HEY! -Is there any problem, sir? -It's nothing. Thank you. -Sir, are you sure it's nothing? -It's nothing. Thanks. Okay, sir. Drive safe. What happened? Is everything okay? I'm okay. Nothing happened. Why did you ask me hurry? I got transferred to Thanjavur. They informed me two hours ago. Okay… Is that why you asked me to hurry? My wife and my son went to the market yesterday. All of a sudden, my son went missing. Oh God! My son is missing! -He was nowhere to be found. -Did you see my son? After some time, he came back with this letter. Your son who went missing yesterday came back only because you're a policeman. If you're thinking of helping your friend even after this… Your son won't come back the next time. If you wish to be alive and with your family… Collect the transfer order that just arrived at your station …and leave town. When he came to know that the police are reinvestigating the case… He sensed that he might get caught. He's also targeting me now because I'm helping you Till now, I've been with you through everything. No matter what… …please don't call me. Please don't use my name. I can't abandon my family. Please… Come in. Have some coffee. No. I'm good. I'll get going. Hey. Anything can happen. Be careful. [phone rings] Mom! What happened? Uncle, why is everyone gathered here? What's wrong? -What happened, Uncle? -What is left to happen? Show that to him, sir. Mom… -I didn't do anything, Mom -Everyone says the same when they get caught. Uncle… I really didn't do anything. We just saw the photo where a girl is lying on you. But you are saying that you didn't do anything. How will they believe you? Arumugam! I don't want any of this. It's a marriage that we arranged. Let's call it off together. -I promise. I didn't do anything. -We don't need this. Sensible decision, sir. You're a righteous man and that's why you've taken the right decision. Else it would have been a huge shame. I apologize for this shame. Look at the shame you've brought me! Don't ever step into the house with the excuse of meeting your mother. -We're leaving, sir. -Okay. Mom… Mom… Sathya! How did you get this, Uncle? Some good soul sent this to Priya via courier. One minute. The present that you gifted Priya. Mom… Dear… What are you doing? I don't know why… …all of a sudden, I feel anxious and stressed that, something bad is going to happen. But I know that my son will never do anything bad. Because you grew up watching me from the moment you were born. All these years, you have gone through so many struggles and have faced them all alone. If I had thought of taking a wrong decision like that… I had so many chances to do so. Despite that, we think about it sometimes. During times like that… I'd be reminded of you. Who'll be there for you if I'm not here? Isn't it the same for me too? Whatever may happen… …find your way and come out of it. Despite that, if you still feel like doing something… …just think of me once. Don't take dire decisions. Brother… Dear God! What happened? Why is the glass shattered everywhere? -Go make a coffee for me. -Can I clean it? Make me some coffee, first. Sir… Sir! -Who do you want to meet? -The warden! The warden asked me to come. -Excuse me! -Where is the warden's office? -Here, sir. -Okay. Thank you. Sister! Who are you? What do you want? Is Thara here? Which Thara? -Doctor… -Doctor? -Who are you? -I'm her distant relative. I need to talk to her. I don't know who you are. We can't tell anything to strangers. It's really important. I need to talk to her. Many uncles and cousins like you come here. Are we supposed to answer each and every one of them? This is a ladies' hostel. Then there'd be no safety for our girls. Go! Get out. I'm talking respectfully. Aren't I? Then why are you getting all worked up? Nobody is getting worked up here. You get going. Go on! -Hey Ramaiya! -Coming sister. Are you just letting anyone who passes by inside?! -What is this, sir? -Send him out. How could you just walk in like that? She's screaming at me! -Ramaiya! -Coming sister. What are you talking to him for? -What are you doing? -He's not listening to me, sister! Sir? Who is it? Aren't you the guy who turned up at the hostel in the morning? Why are you coming home? Who are you? You just walked in today without permission! The sister gave me an earful for letting you in today. Looks like I'll lose my job thanks to you! I didn't ask anything inappropriate. I asked for the details of this girl called Thara. Come along. Who are you, sir? Why have you come here? Why are you scared to hear that name? What else do you expect? My family is dependant on this job of mine! Don't ruin this for me. Leave! Do I look like someone out to create problems? You have a daughter her age. Tell me what you know, sir. Please! I won't create any problems for you. Please help me out, sir! Hey! HEY! WHO ARE YOU? Where are you going? Stop! Sister! Someone's trespassing into the building! Please come, sister! They went up, sister! HEY! WHO ARE YOU? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? -What? -Where's that girl? -Ramaiya! -I won't let you go! [commotion ensues] Ramaiya! Don't! -Don't! -Sister… Let's call the police, sister! -Let's call the police! -Hey! Don't do that! If we are to inform the police, we must consult with the church first! When the sister hesitated to take action… I grew suspicious of her. It's my bread and butter though! How could I complain? That girl never acted arrogant just because she was studying to be a doctor! -Which college did she go to? -Medical college. She was enrolled for her higher studies! -Her home? -She had no home or relatives! Father Vincent was her guardian! Had he been well, this problem would've never happened! Why? What happened to him? Don't you know what happened? -Is the dean inside? -He's on rounds. -When will he be back? -I don't know when he'll be back. And you are? He knows me. Please wait. He'll be back. -Did you ask sir about it? -No, I'll ask him during the rounds! There's a seminar next week… Hey, you go on. I'll join you in a bit… Hey! The guy who was looking for Thara yesterday… He's here! -Who? -The guy who came to the hostel! -It's him! -Near the dean's office? You're here to see Thara, aren't you? The dean will be delayed. We'll take you to Thara. Come with us, sir! -Take me to see who?! -Thara. Didn't you go to the hostel looking for her this morning? Come with us, sir. It's alright, come with us! We'll take you to meet her. -Come with us. -Come with us, sir. Come on. -Why'd you come looking for Thara? -Hey! Did you come looking for her? Or did she send you to have a look? -Tell us! Why are you here? -Answer us! -I said answer us! -Why are you here? Tell us! -Answer us! -Punch him! Hey… Hey! Take your hands off! Out of my way! Are you studying to be doctors or thugs? I should've suspended you all when I suspended him! Go tell him… He can't set foot in this college if he continues acting like this! Aren't you here to see me? Come with me. Why is everyone crowding up the place? Get going. Nobody knows anything about Thara! I came to meet you to see if I can find information, at least here. How are you related to Thara? Father Vincent told me that Thara is in some trouble here. And that it would be better for her to study abroad! So, I've made arrangements through a source of mine, for her to continue her education in the UK. I've been looking for her ever since! Nobody seems to know anything about her! I'm a bit scared, sir. Don't worry, your fears are unfounded! Thara is a very brave girl. She's faced a lot of hardships without anyone's help and made it this far in life! -It's not that, sir-- -Sir… She's known to switch off her phone, and travel to villages in the hills! She conducts camps for the tribals over there! There are strong possibilities that she'd have gone somewhere! No need to worry. Otherwise… Is she in any trouble over here, sir? What kind of trouble? The boys were ready to thrash me, just for mentioning her name. It can't be termed as trouble… But… Sophia was an orphan, just like Thara. Nobody expected her to commit suicide! A few days after that happened… Hey! Who killed Sophia? You know everything! -What are you saying, Kadhir? -HEY! Stop acting! She shares everything with you, more than with me! I swear she didn't share anything with me! Her death hurts me more than it does to you! Enough! Your guardian… Father Vincent! You're doing all this to save him, aren't you? Hey! -Don't talk ill of the Father! -What will you do if I did? WHAT WILL YOU DO? Would you kill me as well? Don't be delusional, Kadhir! What exactly is useless? Her… you… I know what he does with girls who are raised by him… SHUT UP, KADHIR! Let go of her, Kadhir! Let her go! -Let go of her, Kadhir! -Hey, Kadhir! Don't do this. -Let her go! -This will turn into a huge problem! Kadhir! Kadhir! Let her go! -Let go! -This will turn into a huge problem, bro! Let me go! After that issue, I suspended him! But personally, I tried talking to him after that incident to make him understand. But he still has his doubts. Does Father know about this? He's aware of it to an extent. Thara was adamant about filing a police complaint against him. Father consoled Thara against filing a complaint to keep her from adding fuel to the fire. Sir, could you… The Father has lost his memory. Even if he survives… He'll be bedridden for life! Only Christ can save him now. -A moment, please. -Sure. Who are you? I'm here to meet the Father! -What happened to him? -Last Friday night… He met with an accident! -And you are? -Father Vincent… I've known him for a long time… I've been with him for three years but I've never seen you even once! We don't meet frequently, but… But we talk on the phone regularly! Father… Do you know a medical college student by the name Thara? I don't know anyone by the name of Thara. Who are you? Isn't Father Vincent the guardian of that girl? If you've been with him for three years… You would know that girl. Father has been the guardian of many children! I don't have to know every single one of them! No! I didn't mean it that way, Father. Sorry! The last time I met Father… He asked me if I could help the girl with her higher education. That is why I asked you. I'll leave now, Father. Please take care of him. One minute… Aren't you here to visit Father? Father… That's the man who turned up the other day! Hello, sir. -What are you doing here? -An issue, sir. Come in. [chuckles] Hello! Hello, sir! How do you know where I live? I asked the bank you're working at. They gave me your address since you were on leave! Why did you go to the bank? Sir, my life has become hell! That DSP is hell-bent on sending me to jail, sir! I'm not that kind of guy, sir. I can't even open the shop! He makes me sit in the station everyday, sir! I don't know why he's targeting me, sir! So why did you come to my house? Sir, I need a favor from you. I went to the house of everyone we traveled with, sir! If they put me in jail… You have to support me at the court. Don't say anything against me, I'm a family man! You didn't commit any crimes. Why are you afraid then? If they can't find the killer, they'll frame the one they can find! Sir, can I get some water? -Yes, it's over there. -I'll… I'll get it! -Sir, are you a bachelor? -Yes. Are you married? I'll be married soon! Could you leave soon? I've got work to do. I'll see you, sir. I'm off then, sir. One minute, sir. What you said was right. If they can't find the killer, they'll frame the one they can find! But sometimes… The one they find will escape. Watch out. -Was he there? -Yes. Get in. Why does he stay in a place like this? I have no idea. I brought you here because you forced me to. Kadhir… Kadhir? -Sir? -What are you doing here? What are you doing here? I searched all over town. I came here finally knowing you'd be here. This is Sathya. He's close to Father Vincent. He wants to ask you something. -Have you come here to negotiate on his behalf? -HEY! Act decent! He'll commit murder and send over someone to negotiate a deal… And I'm supposed to act decent with him? It's wrong to react this way about something you can't confirm! I KNOW! She has no other reason to die, besides that Father! Do you know how happy she was? Sophia, Father Vincent wanted to meet you. Does he know we're here? I don't know, but he's angry now! -Wait here. I'll be back after meeting him. -Do you want me to come along? No! I'll take care of this. She walked away with so much happiness, right in front of my eyes! And you're saying she committed suicide! I'm supposed to believe this! That Father is behind all this! I didn't say a word, even when the police asked! Him… And that Thara… I'll kill them with my own hands! What did Thara do in all this? How's she involved in all this? Wasn't she friends with Sophia? And who are you to support her? Why'd you go to the college, first? What did they want so bad that they sent you here? I've been waiting every single second to kill them! Thara, just before she left college… Ruined Sophia's samples and walked away with her files, in order to save the Father. And you're asking how she's involved in all this?! -Answer me! -Hey! Did she send you to spy on us? Hey! Sir! Are you okay? Come on, let's go! Let's leave! Thara, just before she left college… Ruined Sophia's samples and walked away with her files! I need to go out of town next week. -Set up the place, could you? -Okay, bro! -HEY! -Hey… -What happened? -What's wrong, bro? What happened? I've come alone. Do what you want! But before that, have a look at this and decide for yourself. Who are you? Doesn't matter who I am… The day the Father met with an accident… The girl he helped raise, Thara, went missing! You and the sister know all too well about this! Why haven't any one of you gone to the police? We don't have to tell you anything! Do you want to talk to the police, then? You want to go there? Thara is a major. She's a brave, educated girl. She could've gone anywhere! We don't have the right to interfere in her personal life! I can tell by the look on your face… That you're hiding something. There must be a link… Between the Father's accident and Thara's disappearance! I swear on God that we don't have a clue about where Thara is! Our only goal is to prevent Father Vincent's name from getting slandered… Father, I promise you. By telling me the truth… No problem would come to the Father… Or this church! What is it, Father? I have some urgent work that I need to attend to. Can you manage till then? Father! How could we manage without you? The Bishop is coming too! It would be wrong if you weren't present! Come back, Father. Please! By the time the Bishop arrived and completed the function, it was late. Till then, Father was anxious! I understood there was a problem when I saw him leave in a hurry! I don't know what happened to him after that. That night, I was informed by the Sister that Thara hadn't returned to the hostel. I told her that we should wait till Father Vincent arrived! But I don't know what happened after that! To know what happened, Father Vincent or Thara have to come back! We're already facing problems after a girl named Sophia committed suicide! We were confused when Thara went missing at the same time. We kept quiet thinking, if we did something without knowing what happened, that would bring trouble to our church! Where is the file from that girl? You better hand it to me! Else, you're dead! Give me the file! Tell me where the file is! Who are you, man? Hey, what's going on? What's happening here? Hey you, stop there! He's escaping on his bike! What's the issue, sir? What happened, sir? What was the issue? It was nothing, sir. -Thank you for helping. -It's alright, sir. How can you dismiss it easily as though it was nothing? Someone random just thrashed you. File a complaint with the police. Hand him to the police! It'll become an even bigger issue if the police intervene. -Is that okay? -Yeah right, they're a huge headache for me. I don't know what the heck is happening. There have been so many issues this past week. And now, it's the drainage. Sir, it's from your flat! If I get a guy to clean that waste from the drainage, I'd need another guy to clean up that waste! Such a nuisance this is! Come along, you. And now, it's the drainage. Sir, it's from your flat! I need to charge my phone for five minutes, sir. Sir? -May I come in? -Come in, Sathya. Welcome. It is illegal for me to hand this document to you. Thankfully, the college is closed today. Here you go. Thank you, sir. For taking the risk to hand this to me. I don't think I can lead a normal life without your help. I'm just an ordinary bank employee, sir. When all these events happen to such a person, what else would one do? Not knowing what next to do, I would have committed suicide just like Vinod did. If it wasn't for my mother, I'd have died long ago. What's the point in just being alive? How long will I play the cat and mouse game? In order to stop hiding, I have to find out what happened at my house that night. And I did. When I first saw Kadhir, I had my doubts. But after finding this in my car, it was all clear to me. And that clarity made me go in search of that murderer. The photos he took intrigued me. And those helped me confirm who the murderer was. But it isn't enough that only I know. I went to the Father's accident spot because I wanted to confront him with hardcore evidence. Once the evidence proved who the murderer was, I asked Kadhir to reach out to him. And that's when something unexpected happened. He knew that I knew everything. I thought he'd confront me about it directly. But he? He sent a goon to have me killed and seize the evidence! Where is the file from that girl? And that mistake of his became a huge help to me. If he hadn't sent that goon, I wouldn't have found that phone or the evidence it had. Do you want to know who he is? Now that you have the video from that phone, how will I let you go? What's this, sir? I took you for a reputed, well-educated doctor. How can I extract the video? It got tarnished in the drainage. I don't have any evidence with me. But the knife you have around my neck… That's my evidence. You must be alive to show this evidence, right? Even Thara had evidence! Do you know who from Tamil Nadu is among the top 10 forensic surgeons of India? Forensic science isn't required to slash one's throat. Didn't you murder Thara for this file? You knew Thara had all the evidence about Sophia, right? There are conclusive findings of resistance and assault on her body. Bite impressions and nail impressions on her neck and thigh… These details weren't mentioned in the report you submitted to the police! Didn't you perform Sophia's autopsy? I had my doubts when you brought in your men for the autopsy… that it was a murder and not a suicide. She was brutally raped, and pushed from upstairs and conveniently framed it as suicide! This is solid proof of what I could gather! Whoever you did this for, should be penalized. I will bring justice to my friend Sophia! If you don't change the reports and submit it to the police, every student will have a copy of this tomorrow morning. Not just the students, even the press and media will have access! You sent your henchmen to get the evidence Thara had. But Thara managed to escape from the goons and got into my car. You knew that she would eventually meet with Father. You followed the Father and… You found Thara was at my house using the Father's phone. You lit the server room as proof and came to my house that night. Where is Father? The lift is under repair and Father is downstairs. Who lives here? -Someone lives here. -No need to disturb him. Take your belongings and let's leave. Go. I'm telling this for your good. Father will not come here to save you. He's dead! How dare you record me? Where is that file? Do you also want to join Sophia? After everything, you placed her body next to me and photographed us, right? I took those photographs thinking it'll come in handy to safeguard myself. But… When that DSP… turned the case against you, I got scared! No one can bribe that DSP. Wasn't Thara your next victim even if she didn't have any evidence? Because Thara was also an orphan like Sophia. A postgraduate student studying on merit from an orphanage. Nobody would question their whereabouts if something happened. But I couldn't figure this… How could an ordinary medical college professor commit two murders and lead a normal life? Only then I found out it didn't stop with just a rape and two murders. Did I piece the puzzle correctly? In the three years that you've been the dean, six random students have committed suicide and died mysteriously in accidents. These weren't suicides or accidents… but murders. Because all six of them were postgraduate students. Orphans with no one to question their whereabouts. They were orphans who got admission through merit. Once you murdered them and the chaos surrounding their deaths decreased, you sold those seats for millions to rich students in a few months! Am I right? Isn't it your business to sell the seats of students without a rank? What a huge crime! When I wondered how could an ordinary dean pull this off all alone… Not just this college, I noticed it's happened before! Many deans like you use dishonest doctors, local MLAs, MPs, ministers, and police to build a network of influential people… Who am I, sir? I'm a nobody. Will you let me live after knowing the truth? I'd rather die. When you can commit murders, hush everyone about it and rest easily… I'm just a tiny speck of dust before you. I'm out of this! Let this be between us. But if you plan to murder me despite this, or even attempt to… There exist many officers who are still true and loyal. I will ensure they get their hands on certain information. However ordinary I may be, don't I have a conscience? When a multiple murderer can sit composed, how can I let you go that easily? You're India's best doctor. When you can perform such amazing surgeries, imagine the power of your students. Bye, sir. This is for Sophia!
