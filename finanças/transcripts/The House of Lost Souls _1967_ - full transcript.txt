THE HOUSE OF LOST SOULS - Doctor. - What is it, nurse? Francínek, I mean Mr. Moose is not in his room. Have you looked in the smoking room? Yes, he's not there, neither was he in the bathroom. I just checked, and the hall was closed. We'll take a look together. Don't worry, you'll have him back soon. They called at 7:30 AM from the mental hospital that somebody had escaped. And at 9:30 AM we had a call from Jedlová district, that Mr. Pešek here found a dead man wearing hospital clothes. - Good day. - Good day, can you tell us anything about it, Mr. Pešek? Well, only what I've already told the officer here. - I heard loud bangs in the night. - What was the time? - I'm not sure. A little before 2 AM. - Did you look at your watch? No, but I couldn't sleep for a while and just then the clock struck the hour. - How many shots did you hear? - About 2. Maybe there were 3. What did you do after? Well after that... You don't want to go out in the cold from your warm bed. I didn't go take a look until morning. This is what I found. It's Franz Moose. Sudeten German, originally from Jedlová. He was identified by the asylum caretakers. He got 15 years in '46 for taking part in war crimes but after 5 years he was transferred for psychiatric treatment. A bullet to the gut and lungs. Probably revolver shots. Seems like one of the bullets hit the spine and was lodged inside. - Entry points are in his back. - Hm. Anything else? - That's all for now. I'll have more after the autopsy. - Thanks. If he got as far as here, he must have had a vehicle. The murderer had, rather than him. Who could he pose a danger to after so many years of isolation? - You've been working here long? - Twenty years. There used to be a hunting lodge here at the Golden Meadow. It burned out in '46. Any why is it called Golden Meadow here? When the snow melts in May, the whole hillside blossoms yellow. That's why it's called Golden Meadow. These little yellow suns, you know. - Yellow suns? - Yeah. It's called leopard’s bane. Good day, doctor. A moment. The head physician has an office in the convent. We still say convent and abbey, even though they were abolished long ago. The end is coming... Death... The ending. Death lurks behind windows and looks towards your souls... she wanders around... hear her malicious female tread. There is still time. There's time... Mr. Kozdera, close the window. - How are you doing, Mr. Běhounek? - All is normal, doctor. I've successfully resolved the problem of baology. - Yes? - Yes, it has four levels. Arivation, vebuta, vegitation, veributation... Mr. Běhounek, the doctor doesn't have time, perhaps tomorrow. - But I won’t be here tomorrow. - Where are you going to be? I have 2,000 convents to take care of. - We'll leave it for tomorrow, Mr. Běhounek. - Come with me, Mr. Běhounek. Could you please tell us what kind of illness he's suffering from? Well, I shouldn't. Nurse! Wait a moment please. Paranoid schizophrenia. Did you know he was a great architect? - Please, the head physician is waiting. - Thank you. Find out where Filiberta is and get Werner. It is complex here in the border region, comrades. When we took over in '46... Try to imagine... Sudeten... the expulsion of Germans in full swing, shooting on a daily schedule. And over 300 patients left here in this sacred convent. - Germans of course. - And what about Moose, doctor. Moose... Wait... Schizophrenia. Chronic. He occasionally suffered from hallucinations. But he was normal during remissions and had done various labours. - You knew his history, naturally. - Yes. He came to us straight from prison. That's usual. - And you know why he was condemned? - Something he did during the war. It's hard to judge if he was sick when he did it, or if the illness started during his sentence, you know. It comes slowly, unnoticeably. Most of our patients used to be normal people. Like you and me. And how has he been lately? I mean before his death. He tried to escape twice, if I remember. - Interesting. - Nothing special. In his first attempt he broke a window and shutters about two years ago. The second time he hid in the garden and jumped the wall. And this time? I really don't know. He vanished from a locked ward. Everything was in order. - Good day. - Don't you see I have visitors, Martha. - I just wanted to ask something. - I don't have time now. - Excuse me, my wife. - It's OK, I'll wait. What is it? Nothing, I just wanted to ask if I should clean your coat. Don’t know, up to you. Oh please. Why are you so annoyed all the time? I've told you not to disturb me with such trivialities in my office. Sorry, I wanted to see you for once. Goodbye. Forgive me. This environment gets on her nerves. Is it hard to escape this place? Not really. A spare key can be easily made in the workshop. However, most lack the skill and initiative to do so. Who was on the ward that night? Who was on duty? Nurse Filiberta and Doctor Kolář. Come with me to the X-ray, Mr. Karásek Listen Doctor, can they ever return among normal people? Do you think Moose's murderer was normal? Sure, crime is always a kind of a mental disorder. But such a person knows what he's doing. If the cases are not of chronic character, treatment is possible. We give them tranquillisers, insulin... But it takes several years. When did you start your shift yesterday? The shift starts at 6:00 PM. And you're on call at all times? Yes, I can sleep there. The nurse can wake me up if something happens. Like today at 4 AM. They called me to an anxiety seizure, but that happens all the time here. Where is the on-call room? Beyond the hallway to the convent, there's also the women's ward. So, you were in the on-call room all night until 4 AM? I arrived at 11 PM. Where were you before that? In Karlovec, with Dr. Dvořáková. But Holý knew about that. - There's few of us here, we must help each other out. - Of course, of course. - And Moose's room? - It's here in the convent. I must tell you nurse, I don't know if I'd put myself in your shoes. Everything depends on what you're aiming for. Everyone has the same opportunity. - And there is no place that has more of it than here. - I understand. If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love... Yes, I am a noisy gong. What do you think? How did Moose get out? I really don't know. Everything was in order. And what do you do during night shifts, nurse? I stay at the infirmary or the changing room. I leave the doors open at all times. I sometimes sit outside to see into the hallways around the cloister. Then I check the rooms and the lights again. - Do you check the rooms later in the night? - Yes. All of them or just some? Almost all. Almost? When was the last time you saw Moose? In the evening. More specifically. I don't know what the exact time was. And then? I came to his room again at 5 AM. But by then Francínek, I mean, Mr. Moose, was gone. I searched the smoking room, the toilets, the workshop where he used to paint. - And then I called Dr. Kolář. - How? He was in the on-call room. Otherwise doctors live here in the tenements. - Did Moose use to get any mail? - No, never. Visits? Only in the last few years, I think. Relatives from Germany. Miss Rýdlová has the records at the office. Who is she? I don't know. - Moose called her Ute. - Ute? I think it's a name. That's Dr. Dvořáková That man really knew how to paint. - He did. - Patients can paint here?! Why not? Was there anything suspicious about him? He seemed disturbed, but I didn't expect such a shift. Disturbed? - Was it due to his illness or... - Yes. Do you think he was able to act rationally? During remissions the intellect is unchanged. I think it's leopard's bane. - What did he imagine under it? - I don't know. So, at the moment of crisis it was only you and the nurse in the ward, yes? And Kozdera. Can I speak with him? Sure. But whatever he says, it won't matter. Mr. Werner can we borrow Mr. Kozdera for a minute? Of course. Pepánek! Good day, Mr. Kozdera. That's our new doctor. He came to examine you. How are you doing? Do you have any complaints? I have no complaints. You know that very well. The brothers told me I must withstand a great ordeal. Here is the only place where you can still hear his voice. Do you want to go for a walk? I haven't been around here yet. - Have a cigarette. - Do not tempt me! I have a tank in my leg that collects nicotine and alcohol. Sorry, I forgot. Have you seen Moose by any chance? I have not. And do you know when he left this morning? He didn't leave this morning. You know that well. He left with the brothers. Matouš and Leo were accompanying our lady and he wanted to stop them. Moose wanted to stop our lady? Not Moose. You know that well. HE wanted to stop her. Moose jumped out and looked for his shoes. And where? Where did he look for the shoes? Bite me. Mr. Kozdera, Moose was looking for his shoes? - Why do you tempt me? - Come Pepek, tell the doctor here. Or you'll first tell us about reincarnation? It's over, you won't get a word out of him. Very well, Pepánek. You can go back to work. It's hard with Pepek. He just preaches all the time. Stop by if you need something. Moose's belongings are nothing you'd write home about, but I still had them locked up to be sure. - Is that all? - You don't need much here. Did you know Moose? You get to know the patients after 8 years. Well, I think it was a deliverance for Moose. - He wouldn't get out of here anyhow. - Maybe. Only the nuns here consider this state an ideal path to salvation. And how did you get here? I wanted to make ceramics but the school rejected me. Well, I was young, and they paid well. One of the patients painted this? Well, not that I want to offend someone. No, no. A classmate. He was accepted to art school. I originally wanted to do something completely different. I have to say, I don't understand painting at all. No one understands it here. Can I stop by for a lesson? I don't think I'd tell you much. Good evening. Good evening. Visits are not allowed at night. I'm not a visitor, nurse. Would you allow for a somewhat inappropriate question? Please. And will you tell me the truth? I always tell the truth. Nurse... Did you ever regret entering the order? You'll be surprised but no, I did not. You know, as your world is incomprehensible to me, mine is incomprehensible to you. I never wanted a car or a coat... These things have no meaning for us. Thank you. I wanted to ask if I could hear Kozdera's preaching. But captain... Just for a moment, nurse. The head physician would be furious. What would he be doing here in the evening? - I'll talk with him about it tomorrow, or should I call him now? - No. The head physician is too strict about it. Only for a moment, I'll accompany you. No, don't bother, I know where his room is. But only just for a moment! For I am the truth, love and life... Good evening, Mr. Kozdera for I am the truth, love and life... What is taking Mr. Moose so long? How come he didn't arrive for the preaching. HE took him. He reigns above the souls of many. How come he took him? Moose didn't have his shoes. But he had them, sure he had them. He hid them so he could leave with him. Why didn't you stop him? Mr. Kozdera! He is unstoppable. He comes and leaves whenever he wants. Where did he take Francínek? Do you understand? Where did he take him? There! Don't do this to me! These kind of experiments?! I didn't lend you the keys for this. House rules apply for everyone, please. - How could the nurse allow this?! - The nurse doesn't know about my visit. Here, the doctor decides if the patient is to be questioned. - We would probably have no luck at the court with the testimony but... - I only wanted... You cannot let this happen, nurse! Allow strangers to a patient. Don't tell anyone about this, Radka. I don't want him to know. - Before everything is arranged. - Maybe he'll be against it. - I don't know about that. Good night. - Night. - I was almost stranded out there. - How come? I relied on the gas can but it was dry. - I filled it on Wednesday. - Yeah, I know. There was nothing in it today. Listen, do you know that Holý wants to leave? Yeah? Because of Moose? They're offering him something near Ostrava. So, he'll slip away and leave Alenka to Werner again? Who knows? Maybe he wants to take her along. - Marta is divorcing him. - Really? When I get out of this hole, I'll be the happiest man on Earth. All these detectives now... I don't know why Holý took them in. And why did you move here, Honza? You want to be buried here alive? I don't know... Maybe. Nobody just shoots a patient, who has been out of human society for 15, 20 years. There was only Kolář and Filiberta on the ward that night. We can't forget the patients. Kozdera knows something. If Holý hadn't come... Was it his intention? I think Holý, Dvořáková, Werner or Rýdlová could get to the ward the same. Sure. Kolář has an alibi only until 11:30 PM and from 4 AM. Filiberta wouldn't handle it alone. She'd have to have an accomplice. There is a gate from the cloister to the gardens and garages. If we only knew the motive. Again! So, he attempted escape three times. First he broke the shutter, using violence. Then he hid in the garden using deceit. - Thirdly he vanished without trace. - Maybe he found a partner. - And he killed. - But why a lunatic? Well if we know that, we'd know the motive. But Moose was not a logician. He was a psychotic. What if he wasn't? We took samples of dirt from all the hospital cars except for one that was washed. And next morning the analysis showed that number plate SU4235 has the same dirt as on the road here. But the times don't match. The gamekeeper heard the shots at 2 AM and Kolář returned... - At 11 PM, with the car. - He could have left again. The journey here is less than an hour. He could have... Around here we found a cartridge from an old war pistol. It matched the projectile found in the autopsy. And here was an... Iron shard, some kind of a shiv, probably Moose's, it had his fingerprints. Must have been quite a hit. It's at chest level and fresh. What if Moose attacked first? - Do you have his old file? - Yes, but there's nothing special. He was an art historian and during the war a member of special taskforce... Rosenberg. Rosenberg's taskforce was commissioned to collect art from all over Europe. For Hitler's upcoming museum. Of course, all of them took something on the side. Göring most of all. They were experts? They were highly schooled specialists of course. The things were returned to their original places after the war. But it's still not over today. We still find items that were considered lost or even destroyed. So, it's somehow possible to hide a painting for 20 years? Paintings survive centuries. What are 20 years compared to that? We age much in 20 years, but paintings won't. Did you know there were paintings found in a shaft in northern France recently? And in an Italian lake. Of course, it needs professional storage. That's what I'm interested in. Well, it's best to fix the paintings in tensioning frames. Then you put them in a big flat box. Wrap them in waxed paper. Then you place them in a box covered in sheet metal. - Finally, you weld the box. Do you need anything else? -That'll be all, thanks. I'm not putting up with it anymore, doctor. I'll complain to the highest authority. Don't scare us, Mr. Beránek. Tonight Mr. Werner drained my blood with a rubber tube. Again? Just you look at me. He took five liters, who'd put up with it? And how was he doing it? Sometimes he leads the tube through air, sometimes under the water. - May I enter? - Yes, yes, come on in. Write a complaint, Mr. Beránek, I'll confirm it. Thank you, doctor. Goodbye, nurse. What do you think, doctor? Could Moose fake his illness? In theory, even in praxis, malingering is possible. But... A layman has a warped view of mental illnesses. A patient can simulate it a month or two, maybe for a year but hardly for several. Moose was really ill. I wanted to ask, is it possible for a mentally ill man, to project things from his former life to his current work? Yes, of course. So, if Moose repeats the same motif in two paintings, we can presume they remind him of something. - You mean... - Yes, leopard's bane blossoms and a woman. - Maybe he liked the colour yellow, or a shape. - Maybe. But he could cipher something into them. Cipher? A memory. - Yes, it is possible. - Thank you. Goodbye. - Goodbye. - One more thing. The night Moose disappeared, you returned with doctor Kolář, by car at about 11 PM, right? - Yes? - And then? Was by any chance doctor Kolář with you? Pardon? Dr. Kolář. I'm afraid I don't understand you. The keys to the garage, I have them, then Holý, Werner has a bike here. And Dr. Kolář got a car six months ago. So, any of them could have driven out without anyone knowing. Yeah, they could. Look here, officer, if people can't trust each other, we might as well give up. Am I supposed to tell Kolář I won't let him have the garage when there’s space here? Or should he take the keys from me every time? But... Something could get lost. No, all the spare parts, gas, tyres and such are locked up here in a storage room. And I have the only keys for that. And do you remember at what time you left the garage? I leave around four. All the cars were here. - You didn't return here after? - Why would I do that? And who washed the hospital's car the other day? You? Yeah, me. I drove in some materials the day before, I left the cleaning for the next morning. So that night you had a shift at reception. Yeah, the doorkeeper had a fever so I took the shift. And didn't you hear a car leave after midnight? I have no idea. Wait, I think I heard a car after midnight. - And what could have been the time? - I told you, after midnight. No more than half past midnight. But there's a road back there. And this is the convent garden, the reception is in front of the abbey. - Someone leaving would have to drive past reception. - Nah! The locals used to go through the garden. Over a wooden bridge and up to the road. I'm telling you, if we locked it here like before... This was a hell of a fort. But today... Open doors, they're removing the bars, total freedom. Thank you. Did you see Rýdlová? What? She's a fine lady. And? You should pay some attention to her. - You mean officially or... - I'll leave that up to you. And why don't you try it? Well boy, I've already tried. You can really spoil the fun. So, what did you find out? Dvořáková was severely injured in a car accident four years ago. Her kid died in it. Then she divorced and asked for a transfer here. What else? Then I measured the gate that leads from the garages through the garden to that wooden bridge. But the cars and ambulances can easily get through. You know what's interesting? One time he was caught in Karlovec, then in Morávka. Moose's escapes were in a single direction. Good day. You've been working here long? A few years. So, you must know it quite well here, right? - Well, quite. - And what of the director? - Is he strict? - He'd be happy to twist someone’s neck. And what about Dr. Kolář? He's afraid that someone could come and settle scores with him. Why do you think that is? Well, I've got reasons. Reasons? What kind of? - Oh no, I can't tell. - Come on, Mrs. Suchá! - What kind of weapon? - I don't know! - Wait a moment, Mrs. Suchá! - I must go. What did she say? She said that Dr. Kolář... Has a weapon in a drawer in his office. A weapon? And you're taking it seriously? Everything's possible here. Yeah... You know, comrade captain, we don't like experimental medicine here. We definitely need to consult Dr. Dvořáková about it. But Kozdera knows something. He at least knows how Moose left. Maybe. But there's no medicine that would tell you that, mental illness is no broken leg. I don't think that even narco analysis could help us here. I understand. Last time I gave you quite a cold shoulder. I was angry then. But you should have told me. - Perhaps. - Not perhaps, definitely. Comrade director, do you know Dr. Kolář well? - Only as a colleague. - We'd like to see his desk. - You'll need a permit. - Sure. But this is about a murder. And we can't afford delays. - We want you to come have a look with us. - A moment! Head Physician, can you tell us who has the key for Kolář's office? He and the cleaning lady. - Mrs Suchá? - No Majerová. Suchá is... Oh, so she told you she's cleaning up there? Well, yeah?! Nurse, bring Mrs. Suchá here. That was unnecessary. There are things I know better than you and therefore it's for me to decide. Enter. - Good day. - Good day. - Tell us, Mrs. Suchá, about your cleaning. - What cleaning? But you told us you clean up at Dr. Kolář and that you've seen something in his drawers. Remember, please. So, what now? Can you tell what is in my drawers? I don't remember. Come on, you can tell the men here. A weapon. There's a weapon. - That will be all, you can go now. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. If you want, you can check. No, thanks. I didn't know. No harm done. I just wanted for you to know that you're in a completely different world here. Dvořáková. Is it you Marta? Can you hear me? What happened? She's unconscious, might be poisoning. Looks like barbiturates. What? Yes, that's what I think. Eucoran and vemegrit. OK. Mr. Werner? Mr. Werner? Mr. Werner! Come with me! Nurse, come with me to the infirmary. I'm going upstairs. - What are you doing here? - What happened to her? She swallowed some pills. And where is Holý? Mr. Werner, here are the bedclothes. Prepare a bed in the nurses' room. Nurse! Come here! Holý. Hello? Hello? She won't swallow dorminal by the bottle again. I wouldn't have my stomach pumped for anything. Do you think she's out of danger? Tending to a doctor's mistresses is the worst job of all, you know? Was it serious? No, no. She just mixed up her pills. That happens when you don't think. Or when you think too much, am I right? I prepared everything. You can take her. - You have to be all over the place. - It's an accidental poisoning. - Aren't these accidents called attempted suicide? - Oh, please. She just didn't look. She'll be fine in a couple of days. - I'm going back to bed, good night. - Night. Going for a nap as well? Mr. Werner. What is it? It must me be one of us. What did you do after? After... When I brought in the head physician’s wife, I went to sit in the next room. Filiberta went for the linen, then you came in. I went to change the sheets on the bed in the nurses' room and... Then we took the head physician’s wife there and I went home. And what was the time? I couldn't tell... But Dr. Dvořáková might know, she saw me in reception. She smoked half a cigarette there. And me? I went to bed. Is that all? - Yes. - You can go now. So? The strangulation line is mostly opened in the knot area in cases of hangings. In Kozdera's case the line is full, and that validates your assumption. - So, he was strangled first and then hung up. - Yes. The perpetrator wanted it to look like suicide. This is also proven by the split of the garrotte with marks of window paint, as the cord was dragged on the frame. Yes, that was the first thing that had me thinking it might be murder. Thank you. - Well, good luck. - Bring in Filiberta. Nurse Filiberta, please. Welcome, nurse. - Please, sit down. - No thank you. When was the last time you saw Kozdera? I was just visiting patients when Doctor Kolář called. So, before they brought in Mrs. Holá, Kozdera was asleep. Yes. I check every room since Moose's disappearance. And who visited you at the ward last night, nurse? Me? No one. A woman left the ward a few minutes past 1 AM today. Who was there except for you and Dr. Kolář? - I really don't know. - Come on, nurse. - Maybe the young lady. - What young lady? - Rýdlová? - What was she doing there? - I don't know, she was in the head physician's office. - Alone? No... I don't think so. With whom then? I don't know. I'll tell you then. With him. It's odd when a wife commits suicide and her doctor husband doesn't help her. - How do you know? - That's what I'd like to hear from you. Miss Rýdlová. Did you know they were in there? Yes. Well, not really. Yes or no? I thought so. Why? Because they regularly met there. Yes. And you always pretended not to know about it? Why? While they weren't ashamed, I was. At first, she dated Mr. Werner, I thought it was serious. But then she befriended the head physician. Was Ms. Rýdlová on the ward when Moose escaped? - Probably. - And the head physician? So, you weren't there alone at all, nurse. And what about Mrs. Holá? She knew they met. Do you know why they called me here? I don't know anything. - That's what we all say, Alenka. - Head physician Holý. - How is your wife? - She'll be fine in a couple of days. Very unpleasant accident, isn't it? Please, stop pretending. You know as well as I do it was no accident but a suicide attempt. And what drove her to it? I want a divorce. Can you tell us why? - That's a personal matter. - Sure. Where were you the night Moose disappeared. - In my office. - Until when? - Until 1 AM. - Alone? Yes. You just said something about pretence. Why are you asking then? I think there's a kind of logic in me asking questions. I'd like to continue if you'll allow. At what time did Miss Rýdlová arrive? She gave me a note saying she's sick and wouldn't arrive in the afternoon. Then she showed up after 10 PM. Why do you think she changed her decision? I don't know. So, there were four of you on the ward around midnight. Nurse Filiberta, Dr. Kolář, Miss Rýdlová and you. - Yes. - Yesterday we discussed the possibility of evoking remission. - Is that right? - Yes, sure. Just to get something out of Kozdera, did you mention that to anybody? - I asked the opinion of Dr. Dvořáková. - And? She had doubts about it, as did I. Safety first, you know? Did you discuss our proposal with anyone else? - No, no one. - And Dr. Dvořáková? I doubt that. Maybe with Dr. Kolář. But it was no big secret And what do you think about Kozdera's death? I mean the cause of death. Suicide. The use of a bathrobe cord, is not unique. Unfortunately. But Kozdera was strangled first and hung after. Where were you tonight? In my office. I heard a noise, stepped out into the hallway. There I ran into the nurse. And the rest you already know. Do you know why we called you here? I have no idea. But you know what happened to Kozdera and Mrs. Holá, right? Yes. I heard a noise in the hallway so, I went to see what was happening. Then I met... Werner. What were you doing last night? The same as every day, I go to sleep at 9 PM. You can't do anything else here. You were also at home the day Moose disappeared. Yes. I go for a walk or watch TV from time to time of course. - Where do you watch TV here? - Where? With the patients. But I don't want to bother anyone. Everyone wants to be alone here. And today? I mean yesterday. You weren't watching TV. No. How is it possible that I saw you exit Dr. Holý's office tonight? - If you saw me, why are you asking? - Just force of habit. I'd like to know the truth from you. The truth? I can imagine what things people tell you. It's not an easy life here you know? Here, you see the same faces and the same people all the time. That can get on your nerves occasionally. So you like to socialize with some and not so much with others. But it doesn't mean I have to stop when someone doesn't like it, right? Dr. Holý stays on the ward until morning? No. He goes back home after midnight. Because of people. Let's start from the beginning. Kolář saw Filiberta leaving Kozdera’s room, and she says Kozdera was alive then. Yes. But it doesn't have to be true. Someone might have wanted to use the confusion around Holá and... Increase the number of suspects. Yes, correct. They never were all in Holá's room. Filiberta went for bedclothes, Dvořáková went right back to the on-call room, for her coat. Werner was preparing a bed in the nurses' room. Yes. But don't forget about Kolář. He could have 30 minutes before Filiberta went to check again. Someone could stay behind in the asylum and hide. The caretaker says he saw everyone leave. Nonsense. The door to the convent garden was left open and don't forget that Rýdlová and Holý were on the ward. Six suspects. I have a peculiar thing about Holý here. He signed a document about the need to handover Moose to a psychiatric ward here. He couldn't decide that for himself, but... It's a copy. So Holý signed that Moose is a madman. - And he took him to his asylum right away. - The things we know for sure are: Kozdera mustn't speak and the culprit is in the asylum. But Holý knew that you tried questioning Kozdera. Many people knew. I'm more interested in what Moose was looking for at Golden Meadow. Moose? Moose, Moose... Yea', there used to be two of them. One was a waiter at the spa. And the second one was in "durch die Freude" or something. But both were expelled from here. - Did any of them have a son? - A son? I don't remember. - Was he an officer? - Oh boy! Every other man was an officer back then. But I brought letters from the frontier to the waiter. He was a cripple. And he always shook like this, expecting an obituary. Nothing? Nothing yet, comrade captain. Maybe you'll remember. You must have been all around the place as a postman. Boy oh, boy! I used to cut short my errands here to High Linden. Officers used to bring girls here. You know, soldiers. But they had a lot of canned food in the pantry. What kind of pantry? Was it some sort of outbuilding? Nothing like an outbuilding, it was a hole in the rock. And where was it? There's nothing like it here. I don't remember. It's been quite a few years, you know? Everything gets kind of mixed up. But there used to be young Moose here. He stayed home after Christmas. He used to come here with a girl and they moved some junk and packages here. Boxes! And as I remember, he stacked them next to some rock. And you don't know, what the girl's name was? No. Wasn't her name Ute? I've already told you I don't know. I thought that Mr. Bäcker could remember something in this place. Comrade Captain! - What is it? - There's something in here. There's some kind of a groove. Like from a bullet - This isn't stone, this is... - Weatherworn cement. Give me a torch. Well this is also interesting. Looks like Netherlands school. I’d say, third quarter of 17th century. I could be Wuwerman or maybe Aselain. That's why he ran to Golden Meadow every time, huh? The canvas could use some fixing here. Listen. That Ute could know something about the hiding place. She could never have removed Kozdera. There's a third person going after the hidden item. But why hasn't he done so? Maybe he doesn't know the hiding place. - Then he'll want to get those paintings for sure. Skořepa! - Yes? Get the place into its original state. Grace to the deceased servant Josef Kozdera. For him not to be punished for his deeds for he wished to do thy bidding. And as the true faith connected him with the masses of believers. Now may your mercy bring him to the angelic choirs. Through Christ, our Lord. Amen! Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven. Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth. Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted. God blesses those who hunger and thirst for justice, for they will be satisfied. I have died 6 times and... But I've never had this kind of funeral. Will you arrange one like this when I die? Yes, yes, Mr. Beránek. Go lie down or you'll catch cold. Mr. Beránek! For they will be called children of God. Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven. Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets Mr. Beránek, is this your gun? Or not? A simple yes or no would do. That's a no. Who gave it to you? Remember, Mr. Beránek. You know who it was. Where did you find it? When? Take him away. Nurse. Nurse! You can take him away. Let's go, Mr. Beránek. A strange situation. As if we both stood on opposites side of a wall. Can I tell you something, Captain? Great, let's hear it. I hope we can comprehend each other. I was with Dr. Kolář at Karlovec for dinner. We took 20 litres of gas in a can. I was with Marta Holá in Smrková and I borrowed his car. The tank was almost empty, I wanted to fill it and the can was empty. And you think that someone borrowed it? The closest pump is almost 30 km from here. And what about Dr. Kolář? - He didn't go anywhere? - No. Are you absolutely sure? I've already told you I came back at half past ten. And then? Then? Then I took Moose, drove him to devil knows where and shot him. Oh my, but why? You should know that better than me. I don't know anything about it. Do you often go for a drive? You know... It's one thing to finish your duties and go to the theatre, a concert or go see a football match. But here... What's to do here? Why didn't you report the missing gas from the can? Radka told you that, right? I thought someone borrowed it. It wouldn't be the first time. - Thank you, doctor. - Can I go now? - Naturally. Beránek's gun is the same as the one used to murder Moose. A great idea. Planting a gun on someone who notoriously attempts suicide? Beránek couldn't take Moose to Golden Meadow. No. But we would hardly prove he wasn't able to if he shot himself. We're in a different world here, completely different. If you at least knew the parcel number. Without a number... The comrade in charge is not here today, and I'm new. And do you have old cadastral books here? I think so, but you'll have to come back tomorrow. And cadastral maps? You can find the number in them. There are so many maps here, I'd have to bother with it. Then, please, bother with it. - Please. - Thank you. - So, parcel number 264649. - Yes. Last record on 264649 is in the name... Ute Schwarz, geboren... 30th November 1925. What did you say? Here. On 14th March 1945, Herr Franz Moose is transferring ownership of parcel number 284649 including the cottage on it to the ownership of Miss... Ute Schwarz. Of course, the nurses from the order have their official names. Can I take a look? For example Sister Filiberta. Do you have her here? Anna Václavíková, 14th January 1920. Olomouc. Augusta... They usually work in the subnormal childrens' ward, but we don't have enough nurses here. Did you ever hear the name Ute Schwarz? In connection to Moose I mean. Ute Schwarz? I don't remember. No woman came to visit him as far as I know. Who did you inform of his death? Mr. Gebauer from Nuremberg. Did he ever visit? Several times recently. You didn't mention it last time. You didn't ask. Was there someone present when they met? I don't think so. Who else came into contact with Gebauer? Dr. Holý, I was their interpreter. Here is... A copy of a letter we sent to Mr. Gebauer. - Has he answered yet? Not yet. Yes, yes, thank you. Thanks. We have her. Ute Schwarz, Olomouc, Haugvicova 1240, born on 30th November 1925 in Opava. - That's great. - Just one thing. Three months ago, someone was looking her up in the state records, Jiří Bílek, Brno, Mánesova 36. Of course, the name and address are fake. No, no, the name and address are correct. Bílek has been hospitalised in the asylum here for 8 years. That means someone borrowed his ID. Yes. And that someone else knew the name of Ute Schwarz. He tried to find out the hiding place and didn't succeed. - Or else he wouldn't risk the trip with Moose. - But why did he fail? There's one more strange thing. Ute didn't show any interest in Moose's things for 20 years. Maybe she didn't know what Moose was hiding back then. That's it. - Who is it? - Police. - What is it? - We need to talk with Miss Schwarz. Yes, that's me. - So, you are Ute Schwarz? - No, I'm Irena. Ute is my mother’s name. I almost thought time had stopped. So we are here to see your mother. Can we talk to her? No... My mom died... She died? About six months ago. Hello. That's a friend of mine, he... - Sorry. - What about your father? We lived alone, me and mom. And didn't she ever say something about a cottage in Jeseníky? A cottage? No, she never... Wait! One of mother's old friends stopped by recently. He also didn't know she'd died. - And he spoke about some cottage. - What did he say? Nothing much. He was just surprised and wanted to see the old photos. What photos? - Mom's, back from her youth. - Could you show them to us? That's my grandad. This is grandma', grandad was German and grandma' was Czech so they had to... I know, I know. - This is mom. - Yes. Mixed marriages used to be a problem back then. Excuse me. Do you know the officers in the picture here? No, I wasn't even born back then. - Did she ever tell stories about them? - No, never. Can we borrow the pictures for a few days? - Sure. - Thanks. Listen, the man who visited you, excuse me, - you've seen him before, right? - No, I didn't know him at all. - He was passing through town so he stopped by. - And what's his name? I don't know. He introduced himself but I forgot. Would you recognize him? I have a few pictures here, could you take a look? I think this is him. For sure. - He could have a weapon. - OK. Good evening. Mr. Werner, can we disturb you for a moment? Should I call a doctor? Get one of ours. The time of death is yesterday, between 6 and 7 PM. - Sudden cardiac arrest. - Reason? Caused by morphine poisoning. Morphine was already detected in the coffee grounds. What do you think doctor? Suicide or... Only facts matter to me. My opinion comes second. If he put it in the coffee himself, or someone else did is your business. - And Filiberta? - Filiberta recognised them both. This is Moose and this is Gebauer. Gebauer decided to find a man on the inside to find out something that he didn’t know himself. - The hiding place. - Well... Maybe Moose revealed it to him. But a man who's never visited Golden Meadow could never find it. Well, a forest changes in time. It grows or gets cut down. 20 years is a long time. But things took a new direction after Moose’s death. Let's try and imagine Werner's situation. He has everything within reach. And knows so much about the matter to finish it even on his own. Why would he commit suicide? He had no reason. Nevertheless, a man who committed two murders wouldn't attempt suicide. He couldn't know that you were after Ute Schwarz. That means someone who knew Werner visited her has done it. You think someone poisoned him? Gebauer couldn't have done it. - It must have been someone from the asylum. - Of course. Someone who has been behind all of this. And who else knew we were after Schwarz. By the way, I found cigarette ash in Werner's room yesterday. It was a Pall Mall cigarette according to the laboratory. Werner was a non-smoker. Werner was, but not the person who drank coffee before his death. That means the main culprit is still unknown. - Do you suspect anyone? - Suspect? No. I'm sure... almost. Only direct evidence is missing. We must give a chance for the murderer to show themself. And what if we were to wait until Gebauer came? If he comes... Gebauer? That could work. That could definitely work. Excuse me for bringing you all here, but I'd like to say goodbye to all of you and thank you for your cooperation. As you might know, the culprit has escaped us, but didn't escape justice. That happens. - I would never have guessed Werner. - He wasn't a good man. - He wasn't, Lord forgive me. - I would never have guessed he'd commit suicide. People don't even want it but everything ends up different than they thought. Werner first took Moose to Golden Meadow. How? He took gas from the doctor here and left in a hospital car, from the garages through the back. There was a conflict at Golden Meadow, of which we don't know the cause unfortunately. But we found traces of a blow with a stone and fingerprints. Moose's tranquillizer dose was decreased, so, it's possible he could've entered a fainting state due to his confusion. We mustn't forget he was a schizophrenic who impersonated General Multenberg. Werner could be exposed by only one person. Kozdera. That's why he used the turmoil around Mrs. Holá. He went to prepare a bed in the nurses' room and whilst everyone was in the infirmary, he strangled Kozdera. When he felt we were on his track, he didn't know what to do. Can you tell us why Werner took Moose to Golden Meadow? No, unfortunately, we don't know the motive behind the murder. We know who did it but not why. Thank you all again. - Nurse! Please. - Yes? Could you take the newspapers and mail to the office? - Of course, just hand me them. - Thank you. Well this doesn't exactly look like a vegetative type of a curve. - Newspapers, doctor. - Did I get any mail? - I don't know. What's this? - From Gebauer. Hold this, nurse. - Gebauer? Tell Alenka to leave me the stamps please. Why is he writing to us? He sends his thanks for the obituary. I don't understand the rest. Alenka, please translate a few sentences for me. Gebauer? He'd like to know the details about it. We can't tell him that Moose was shot by Werner. "If you could inform me where I can find his belongings or give them to me." He can ask the police. I don't know what they are going to do with those few things. "I'm passing by, I'll be in Karlovec in Hotel Praha" "on 6th of this month from 2 to 3." That's tomorrow, right? "Give my regards to nurse Filiberta, Dr. Kolář and Dr. Dvořáková." Reply that we gave him all the information we could. Kolář will give you the medical history. Shouldn't we send someone there after all? Not a chance, we'd spend all our time on Moose. We have other things to do. What is it with you? - You're not listening to me. - I am. - Come on. - We should have met sooner. Everything would be different. What can we do, it isn't that simple. I'd like to start anew, you know. But the past will never let you go. - Can we succeed? Is it possible? - Definitely. I have my first divorce hearing in a month. God, I'd like to leave here so much. Forget all the years as if I'd never been here. We would have never met in that case, Alenka. I have to go. Look here, I've had enough problems with the Moose's case. And it wasn't a pleasant situation for our asylum. There's nothing strange about the letter, but I inform you, nevertheless. Yes, it's the right thing to do. Does anyone know you've come here? No, why? Don't mention it to anyone, right? And this letter... Does anyone know about it? Yes, Filiberta, Kolář, Dvořáková, and Rýdlová. - It was no secret, was it? - Sure. Who did you send to Mr. Gebauer? No one. Again, no one. What if no one arrives? It's the only way. Tell me how can Havel be so sure about it? Only one person from the asylum knew we were after Ute Schwarz. That person knew that Werner visited her and also knew about Mr. Bílek's ID. It's the only person who might have a connection to Gebauer. Mr. Gebauer? Please, follow me. Mr. Gebaur. Are you looking for Mr. Gebauer, Miss Rýdlová? - Yes. - Really? And where are Moose’s things? I just came to excuse head physician Holý, he can't make it tonight. Did he send you here? Yes. Mr. Holý, who did you send after Gebauer? No one, I told you before. Come in! What's the meaning of this? Mr. Holý, repeat your answer, please. Subtitles: Jakub Zýka
