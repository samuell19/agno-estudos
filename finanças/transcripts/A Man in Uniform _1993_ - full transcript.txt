Left, asshole. You're gonna cry, tough guy? Huh? C'mon, tough guy. Gonna cry? Huh? Cry, you fuck. This is, uh, Henry Adler for Flanagan. Okay, uh, Henry. You are a cop in a uniform. Flanagan. That guy to your right, he's the bad guy. I say, "Show this boy how we do business downtown," and that's because he's being, um, defiant, so you say, "Okay badass, grab some wall." - Just pretend there's a wall there. Then he complains that maybe you broke his nose, you do the kid glove stuff, uh, then some other stuff, and then he tells one of his girls... Maria. -Right, to call his lawyer, you throw the cuffs on him, you read him his rights, and that's it. Okay? - Yeah, okay. Henry, just keep in mind this guy's a real piece of scum, all right? You know what, he pimps for the woman you love. Controlled rage. - Yeah, exactly, controlled rage. Clear? - I'll do my best. That's all we're asking. 'kay, uh, show this boy how we do business downtown. Okay badass, grab some wall. Take it easy man, I think you broke my nose. Hey, don't push your luck, scumbag, I got my kid gloves on.

You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you. - Okay, that was pretty good, pretty good. Yeah, you had indignation that, uh, really worked, Henry. Did you ever play a cop before? Uh, no, I saw a cop get shot yesterday. Mm, and you used that, good. Hmm 'kay, and I liked that, uh, itchy finger adlib. That was good work. Okay, that's all for now, thanks. - Okay, thanks very much for your time. Henry. - Hello, Mr. Pearson. We've got ourselves a real problem here. - Problem, sir? Yeah, you're two hours late. - Oh no, I had an audition. Remember I told you that? - Oh yeah, of course, that audition. Look, I think the time has come for you to make a career decision around here. Now I've always thought you had a future in banking, but... and how old are you now? 31. - 31 years old, and you're still entertaining adolescent pipe dreams about being a movie star? I'm a trained actor. I'm not sure I understand what you mean when you say "pipe dreams." Are you an actor, or do you work in this bank? Both, I suppose. - No. See, this business is a way of life. It isn't a hobby, it isn't some kind of professional stopover. I need your commitment and I need your focus. There's lots of money at stake here. Well, I've never believed in half measures, sir. Well, that's great, we understand each other. Yeah, we understand each other. Play a cop before? Well, I saw one get shot. And you used that. That's good, that's good. Badass, grab some wall. Don't push your luck, scumbag. I've got my kid gloves on. I said shut up. Shut up, punk, I'll ask the questions. I said, I'll ask the questions. Shut up, punk, I said I'll ask the questions. Piece of shit. Hi, Dad. - Mm. Happy birthday. You look like a gangster. Did you have my tickets? - Yeah, of course. Keepin' busy? - Mhm. Playing a cop in a television show. - Cop, hm. Blessed are those that hunger and thirst for righteousness. For they will be filled. Yeah, I remember. Good. Words to live by. Shit. 6, 15, 24, 31, 44, what did I tell you about 44? - Sorry. 44, never. Never 44. And burn that before the rest of them get hexed. Burn it and flush the ashes down the toilet. You read about the idiot who won last week? Gonna quit his job and buy a sailboat. Sailboat. What a loser. When I take this I'm gonna kick some ass. This is it. This is my show. It's incredible, I... That they did? They said that? No, no, I felt good about it. It's... Yeah this is, like... what I've been waiting for. Sure. Sure, oh no, today's no problem. Okay. Thanks again. Bye bye. Okay, badass. Grab some wall. Oh, don't push your luck, scumbag. I got my kid gloves on. What'd I say about 44? You gonna cry, tough guy? Hm? Hello? - Hi. Uh, my name is Henry Adler. I was told to come here for a fitting. - Who are you? Flanagan. The cop, yeah? - Flanagan. Yes, ma'am. Okay. Hang on. All right. Flanagan. All righty, that's it. Ah, shouldn't I try it on? - Oh, it'll fit. Excuse me? - Mhm? I'd like to take it with me. - The wardrobe? The uniform, yeah. - What for? Well I've been working on my character and looking the part, you know it helps, well I think so. - Sort of a method thing? Yeah, if you like. - Well I'm sorry, I can't do that. Yeah well, the director said I should take it home. To, you know, as I said, work up my... - Your character? Yeah. - The director... The director told you you could have that? Yeah well I thought I should an' ... Well, I'm pretty sure he agreed with me 100%. Yeah. I mean, it's a pretty big opportunity for me. Shit. Sorry. - You know, you've done a remarkable job. I mean, these look exactly like the real thing. - Well, that's the idea, um... What did you say your name was? - Flanagan. No... - Oh, Henry. Henry, if you spot or tear this garment, I will kill you. Yeah okay, great, thank you. Hey, Adler. - Hey. Oh, I guess you got it. - Yeah. Yeah, I guess so. Hey, I meant to ask you, are you gonna be quitting that, uh, bean-counting gig now that your acting career has finally skyrocketed? - Oh. No, no, I really don't think I can afford to. - Best play it safe. That's good. Maria! Playin' a pimp, Brucie, that's a stretch for you. I'm playing your pimp, babe. My tits, my ass... Hi, I'm Charlotte Warner. Oh, Flanagan! - Yeah. Well actually, my name is Henry Adler. Well, we have a lot of scenes together. I play the hooker with a heart of gold. And lots of cleavage. You're sort of my guardian angel. - Right. It's a good role. Maria's a good woman, complicated... Well I've played her before on "Swords of Justice" and "Letter of the Law." I think I have her down. You know whenever they need a slut to slap around I seem to get the nod. Well, I'll take good care of you. Well, thank God for Flanagan and all good cops like him. Well, I'm looking forward to working with you, Charlotte. Call me Charlie. Oh, well, nice meeting you both. Okay, I'll see you on set, Henry. Right, on set. Bye.

Be advised, we may have a man in the water. I repeat, we have a man in the water. Pace yourself, Henry. - I need that report, thanks. Nobody in or out! Everyone get down on the fucking floor. Move! Do it! Shut up! Hands up, sunshine. Come on, let's go, move, move, move! Now, which of you little piggies is the vault teller? I'm in a bit of a hurry... I'm sure you understand. Is it you, big boy? Stay down! - Is it? Why didn't you say so? Get up. The next time... I ask you to do something... You'll be quick. Okay? So what's your name? - Henry. Henry, that was my father's name. We used to call him Hank. Do people call you Hank? No. Thank you, Henry. How long you've been working here, Adler? - 4 years. Okay, Adler. Did she say anything to you when you were alone in the vault with her? Nothing. Well, you opened that vault pretty quick. No, I can't open it. It was open. So why did she pick you? Well, I'm in charge of the vault, so I... guess it's, heh, it's... Okay. Is there anythin' you wanna tell me, son? What? So what's this "Thank you, Henry" stuff? She asked me my name. Okay. Nothing personal. I've never stolen anything in my life. Look, there's right and there's wrong. I know the difference. Oh, you'd see that? Thank you, Henry. And... action! Flanagan. - Sir. Show this boy how we do business downtown. Okay badass, grab some wall. Take it easy man, I think you broke my nose. Don't push your luck, scumbag, I got my kid gloves on. I want to talk to my lawyer. Whoa, what am I, resisting? Shut up, punk. I'll ask the questions. You want me to cuff his ass? - Yeah. Maria, call my lawyer. - Yeah, you do that, honey. Put your left hand behind your head. Left hand! Ow! - What, you gonna cry, tough guy? You have the right to remain silent... - That's a cut. Anything you say can and will be used against you. - Terrific, Henry! That's good for me. - Was that okay? That was very nice, it was very realistic. Henry, you were born to play this part. Asshole. You were fabulous. - Oh, thanks, it felt good. I'm sure it did, you scared the shit out of me. Really? - Yeah. And then, boom. She lets the air out of him. - She kills him right there? She had no heart. Hey, you can take my word for it... cause, you know, I've seen a lot of people like that. They're not even human beings, they're just... just like mad dogs. Like mistakes of nature. What did you do? - I couldn't do anything. I mean if I had a gun or something, maybe. And they got away, of course. Right? Where are the cops when you need 'em? It's amazing. Come on, you don't really mean that, do you? I mean, it's just a little bit too easy to dump on the law. Well, I'm sorry, officer, I didn't mean anything by it. Don't worry, they'll get caught. We got a couple of pretty good leads already. Justice will prevail? We've got to believe that, right? Henry? That was great. - Oh, thanks very much. Yeah, I got her, she's walking... Charlie? What do you think about us getting together and running some lines? I mean we have quite a few scenes together. I think that'd be a great idea. Good. Right, I won't forget this, officer. Now you just watch your step, young lady. Hello. They called me at the bank. Got the day off. They brought me here last night. Yeah, the doctor told me you had a stroke. That's what they told me too. How do you feel? Keys to the kingdom. Keepin' busy? Started my show. Girl I'm going with is doing it too. We're rehearsing together. Yeah, she's all mixed up. Her name's Maria. She's a prostitute. But I save her from the scum, and then we fall in love. But because I'm a cop, it's a... Well it's a difficult situation. Very difficult. This greaseball's peddling junk like there's no tomorrow. Can't bust a guy for having nerve. So we're supposed to sit back and watch this scumbag vomit all over society. So we're just s'posed to sit back and watch while this scumbag vomits all over society. ...what do you want me to say, so we just wait until one more hooker gets zotzed. ...scumbag vomits all over society. Well what do you want me to say? ...till one more hooker gets zotzed. You can't bust a guy for... So we're just s'posed to sit back and watch while this scumbag vomits all over society. Uh, what do you want me to say? What do you want me to say? So we just wait till one more hooker gets zotzed. Don't get... While this scumbag vomits all over society, what are we supposed to do, just sit back? Until one more hooker gets zotzed. 63rd and Empire, suspect is described as a white male, mid 20s, no shirt, torn jeans. Victim has been shot with what appears to be an arrow or a dart, ambulances have been dispatched. Cock sucking motherfuckers, come on! Do me! Come on, you cock suckers! Fucking bastards! Come on! Cock sucking motherfuckers! Bastards, you god damn sons of bitches, fucking come on! Come on! Do me! Do me! Give me a hand with this dirtbag! He's a slippery motherfucker. Now we're winning. You want me to cuff his ass? - No, hold him, I got it. Takes two of you. - Tearin' me up, boy. You want me to read him his rights? You watch too much TV, kid. So what's your name? What? Uh, Flanagan. Some new kind of cop, Flanagan? Where's your gun? I, uh... I left it in the car. In the car? What the fuck is this? Show some respect. Yo, Flanagan! Okay, so he's going on and on and on like this and I'm thinking, you know what... Oh, oh, and then he says, "open it up." Just like that, he said "open it up." Right. Please, like I have to take that shit? So you know what I said to him, I said "Hey look, you wanna go through my stuff?" You go through the proper channels, just like that, see, 'cause I know my rights. You know what I'm saying? Just like that, see, I know my rights. Anything else? Listen, I've got a lot of people waiting. Do you mind counting that someplace else? Relax. Okay? I counted it out right in front of you. If you'd paid any attention... Relax, okay pal? What? You nervous 'cause you shorted me $20? Listen, dirtbag. - Dirtbag? I'm telling you to do something. Now you move your candy ass before I kick it. Hey, who the hell do you think you're talking to? Y'think I don't know about you? - Henry! What you do at night. - Henry, please. I'm sorry. Would you mind? Henry, Henry! - Look, who the hell... I'm sorry, would you please. Henry, you've been under a lot of pressure lately. That robbery must have been a... Well I think it would be a good idea if you took a bit of a break. Oh no, I'm fine. I just know how to handle scum like that. Well, what you may or may not think about the clientele here is of no interest to me, Henry. The fact remains our obligation is to those depositors. Taking care of some punk's drug money? And believe me, I can tell these things. And that type of shit is takin' over. That's not my affair. Yeah well, one day it will be. And you'll come screamin' to the law to come and protect you, isn't that right? Henry, don't force me to let you go. Think very carefully about what you're doing right now. I quit. Y'know, you're part of the problem. You lay down and close your eyes while the bad guys vomit all over society. While the fucking assholes vomit all over society. We're done now, Henry. You know, we're all responsible. And we all have to pull our weight. Who is it? - It's Henry Adler. Hi. - Hi. Oh, I'm not late, am I? - Oh no, come on in. I'll be with you in a second. It's nice. You're very clean. Did you have any trouble finding it? - No, no, not at all. You really are very clean. I thought we'd work on the diner scene if that's okay with you. I was going to suggest that myself. - Okay. We can work here, I set this up. I made us some coffee for some, you know, atmosphere. Oh, I hope you don't mind, I brought my uniform. It really helps me get into it. Your cop uniform? Yeah, if you'd rather I didn't, that's fine. I understand. Oh no, it's fine... I... I don't have my wardrobe or anything, but uh, you know, if it helps you, sure. I guess I could see how it would. Go ahead. Much obliged, ma'am. All I ever wanted to do was play the piano. My father left when I was 5, so I earned extra money playing in the cantinas. And I remember thinking, one day I'm going to do this in Carnegie Hall. Anyways one day I met this guy who said he wanted to be my agent. Anton? - Yes. He said he recognized real talent when he saw it. I was so excited to come to this country. I'm so ashamed. Maria, I can help you. If you help me. And tell me what you know. I'm afraid of him, Flanagan. The police can't touch him. You're wrong, Maria. You're wrong. He's a thief, and a pimp, and a killer, and it is my duty to bring him down like the cancer that he is. Please. Let me help you. Why? I mean, you're a cop and I'm just some cheap hooker. Why should you care about me? I'll tell you why, because I don't just see some cheap hooker who's breaking the law. What I see is a very beautiful, very brave young woman, who's got a pretty nice future in store for her. And I'm not going to sell that out. Do you really mean that? You bet I do. That's a cut. Yes, very good, very good, both of you. Hey, Charlie, I like that kiss. All right, new deal. - Yeah, me too. Freeze! It's all over. You shot me! You'll live. If I wanted you dead, you'd be dead. Chuckles here is out of commission. Ow. Ow, that must hurt. Well, scratch one scumbag. You know, Flanagan, we ought to nickname you "the janitor." No pain, no gain. And cut it. - Okay, that's a cut... Everybody, that's a wrap for today. What the fuck do you think you're doing? You don't keep the gun, pal. Oh right, sorry. Remind me to stay on your good side. - Well, you shouldn't have any trouble. Hey, I'll take it. - No, I'm fine, I'll get it. You sure? - Mhm. Could you close that trunk, please? Thank you. This okay? - Uh huh. Put it by the wall, okay? - Okay. You want a drink or something? - Sure. My ice won't freeze, sorry. Yeah, I have a hard time with appliances myself. Thanks. Is this your boyfriend? No, that's my father. Just a very old picture. Does he live around here? No, he died, long time ago. Was he sick? Huh? - Was he sick? Nope. Just unhappy. He looks like an actor. No, he didn't do much. He just sort of owned things. Guess I was his favourite. How many brothers and sisters do you have? None. You make me want to take care of you. I'm all right. I'm, I'm... I'm sorry, I mean, um... Are you spoken for? I can speak for myself. No, that's... I just meant that, um... Henry. This is probably a little too early for all this. Henry, I'm happy with the way things are now. Right, I understand. Yeah, no rush. Look, I'm exhausted. I think you better hit the trail. Thank you. - You're welcome. Good night, officer. Thank you for not selling me out. Sweet dreams. - Okay. Okay punk, on your feet. Grab some wall. Don't move. What's this? It's not loaded, I swear. Jesus. Where the hell'd you get this? - My dad. Does he know you have it? - No way. You got a wallet, kid? - Yeah. Okay, turn around. Put your hands on top of your head. 'kay, what's your name? - Edward. Yeah, you're right. Edward Nichols. Ever been in jail, Edward Nichols? - No. Y'know crime doesn't pay, Edward Nichols. Anybody ever tell you that? I've heard that. - Well I don't think you were listening. Am I under arrest? Not this time. Let's go. Hey! Now I catch you doing something like this again, you'll do time. That's a threat. So how'd the rest of your scenes go? Yeah well, you know everything just sort of clicked. Thanks, you were too. You know that rehearsing together was a really good idea. Yeah. Listen, I was wondering if, um... maybe you wanted to get together and uh, maybe do something? Yeah, sure. It's just... Well there's something I have to do. And then, you know, we could run lines after. And um, well maybe you'd like to come along. And you'd be doing me a big favour. Dad? This is Charlie. It's the girl I told you about, remember? How do you do, sir. The working girl. We've already done a couple of shows. The relationship is pretty developed. Have you seen it? Um, I was over at the house the other day, everything's fine. What else... Oh, I quit my job at the bank. No, I don't really have time for that anymore, you know. What with me acting full, you know, basically full time now, so... It's "Crime Wave", you saw it before, remember? Very popular. You gotta watch it. See me and my... partner in crime, here. Isn't she great? You'll be amazed when you see it, you won't even recognize me. Thank you. So, I hope we're still on for rehearsal. To be honest, I'd really like to get a drink first. My treat. - Okay. To the long arm of the law. So how'd you like my father? Henry, I like you. But I get the impression that you think that... we're something that we're not, and I don't want you to get the wrong idea. About what? Well I just want to make sure that you know that we're not involved. I mean, how do I put this, I really like working with you. But that's as far as it goes. We're not a couple, you mean? - Yeah, right. These peanuts are awfully oily, they leave a lot of stuff on your hands. I think we should run that death scene today. I don't think we should work today. It's a pretty important scene. Henry, what are you talking about? Well, I mean, we've connected. I mean we have a certain... connection. Are you talking about the scene, or us? I'm talking about what's right and what's wrong. I mean there's so much that's wrong in the world these days... Y'know I wouldn't say this otherwise, but there's something good between us, and well, we can't turn our backs on that. I mean, there's a certain... order to things, and this is part of that. Listen to me, I'm trying to tell you that... God, I hate this. Um... I'm trying to tell you that I'm not attracted to you. Okay? I'm not now, and I'm not going to be. Well, why don't we just wait and see? What the fuck? Henry, I'm sorry, I'm going. No, wait a sec, sit down, I... I want to finish talking about... I don't wanna talk. Sorry. Sit down, I have to talk to... - That's a mistake. Action. Word is, you've been talking to cops. What about, I wonder? No, Anton, I swear. Oh, my beautiful little chatterbox. He's just some guy, really... He wants to save me. Hey, I'm hurt. I thought I saved you. Come on, Anton. - Come on, Anton. So, my baby's got a taste for cops now, huh? No! - Hm? No, Anton, no, Anton, shut up! Faster. - Come on, Anton. No! Oh, God! Oh God, no! Faster. Faster. Oh no! Oh no! Don't! Stop! Listen to me. Listen to me. Told you to do something. Pow! Next time I tell you to do something... Hi. This your car? Yeah. Well, you're blocking a fire hydrant. Yeah well, my hazards are on. Why don't you go around the front and take a look? Well it doesn't matter if your hazards are on, you shouldn't have parked here. What if there was a fire? - I'm having a real bad day, can you give me a break or what? You broke the law. Okay. Give me a ticket. Come on, write it up. Just, why don't you just take it easy... - Look, you pathetic cretin, just give me a ticket and shut your mouth. What's wrong, can't you find your pen? Can you write? Just watch your mouth. Just remember who you're talking to. What are you doing? Let's go, I absolutely refuse to move my car until I get my ticket. Or hey, maybe we can work something out. Let's say I give you 50 bucks. Will that make you forget the whole thing? Well forget it, jarhead. I'm not offering you shit. So write me my god damn ticket. I earned it and I want it. Look, uh, why don't you just get your car right out of here now, okay? Oh, help me! Oh, that is telling me. Boy, you guys have really got it together, you know, especially you, what a winner you are. I feel so much safer knowing I've got real men like you to protect me. Officer, you are a stone killer. I think I just shit myself. Shouldn't have parked here, sir. I'm leaving now, okay? No, I'm afraid it's not that simple. Okay, then give me a ticket. You broke the law. You broke the law. You broke the law. Okay, then give me a ticket. Come on, give me a ticket. Jarhead. You pathetic cretin. Come on, give me a ticket. What'd you say? I said give me a ticket. Okay, up against the car and put your hands on top of your fucking head. I absolutely refuse to move my car, until you give me a ticket. Now why don't you just take it easy, son? What if I give you 50 bucks? Maybe that'll make you forget the whole thing? Shut up, punk. I'll ask the questions. Now you don't talk, you don't move, you don't even breathe. I'm going to read you your rights. Why are you hassling me? Cause you're fucking ugly! You have the right to remain silent. You have the right... to have me shove this gun down your throat and blow your tonsils out. You're fucking hurting me, man. Oh hell, just watch your language. Just watch it. Maybe, maybe I should wash your mouth out with my nightstick. Can I help you, sir? I need bullets. For? Um, one of those. 12 Central North, probable domestic dispute... 11-63... to Central North. 10-4, 11-63, 10-4. You wanna bet? Get out of here my ass, this is where I live! You get the fuck or else. Yeah, that's right! Maybe you could start behaving like a fucking mature individual! Hi. - Hi. What's your name? - Jack. Jack, is your father here? Yeah. - Can you get him for me? Is there a problem? Yeah... We've received a complaint regarding the noise. Complaint, uh... from whom? I believe from the older gentleman who lives next door. I thought that guy was dead. Yeah, I suppose that's possible. Uh, I'm sorry, I don't get it. - Your name, sir. Uh, Joseph Riggs. Mr. Riggs, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to keep it down. You're disturbing the peace. - Joseph? One minute. What's this, a fucking peep show? Perhaps I can be of some assistance? - Uh, officer, I appreciate your stopping by, but my family business has nothing to do with you. And I'm telling you, that if you can't deal with it peacefully, then it is my business. - Everything is fine, there's no problem, thank you for stopping by. Bye bye. Try anything, and the bitch dies. I swear to you. Forget it Anton, it's all over. Over for me, over for her. Drop it. You don't have a chance. - Shoot him! You hear that? You wanna go for it, huh? - It's okay, Maria. It's all right. Now look around you, Anton. Look at the firepower. Flanagan! It's okay, Maria. It's all right. I promise. Flanagan! Hey, shut up now! Listen! Me and the bitch are gonna walk out of here nice and slow. 'kay? Let me go. - Hold your fire. That's right, good boy, very good. Fire! Take him down! Oh no, God, oh no. You can't die. Come on, please... No, I can't go, no! Oh, Flanagan. Keep walking. Yes, Charlie, keep walking. That's right. And... that's a cut. Very good, very good everybody. And that's a wrap for you, Henry. Get her tears, good blood**, everybody. That's right. Okay, get me down from here now. Over there. Yeah, keep walking. Keep walking. Yeah, that's a cut. That's a wrap for you, Henry. It feels like you're really getting shot. Yeah, it's a little less permanent. Might hurt for a day or two. Maybe a week. So how'd it look? Oh, I laughed, I cried, you know. You guys, why'd you always have to blow the shit out of my clothes? It's our job. That's another dead soldier. Here you go, souvenir of your brush with death. Charlie? Can I talk to you for a second? I don't have any scenes left, so... I was hoping that we could be friends. I'm... I'm sorry about the misunderstanding. Sure. Yeah. You were very good today. And don't worry, I see what you were saying now. Listen, Henry, maybe we'll have a chance to work together again sometime. Yeah, sure, I'd like that. Bye. Bye, Henry. Bye, everybody. - Bye bye, see you later. Another dead... soldier. One more dead soldier. - We got an alarm at 369 Mulholland... An antique store. A citizen called in. Maria, he's selling this garbage to kids. Kids. Doesn't that bother you? I want to help, I do, it's just... this is such a big step for me. You have to trust me. - Oh I do, Flanagan, my God, I trust you. I do. What the fuck you looking at? Nothing. - No, no, wait a minute. What's your name? - Flanagan. Well, ah, I hope you don't have any problem with this. No. Cause we have to look out for one another. We're all on the same team, yes? Absolutely. It's what it's all about. What was your name again? Flanagan. Frank. Yeah. Where you from? Uptown. Just heading home. We just rousted a bunch of whores. You want a piece? I don't know. Not very clean, is it? Shy? Are ya? - No. My partner's... a bit slow on the draw. You know what I mean? Yeah. Come on, I'll buy you a cup of tea. All right. Priorities. It's all about priorities. There are certain priorities, that... have to be respected. You understand? I think so. Y'see, we do all the shit work, because nobody else has the balls. Politician, the fucking media, they don't talk about it, but they know the score. Guys like you and me, we make it very cozy for Mr. and Mrs. Jerkoff. After the parade goes by, somebody's gotta sweep up. Yeah. I'll give you an example of what I'm talking about here. Couple of days ago, I'm chasing some prick into a drug store. I'd been chasing him for a couple blocks. What'd he do? Do. Read the fucking report. I'm trying to teach you something here. - Sorry. I'm chasing this scumbag, and he runs into this drug store. He runs down one of the aisles, so I take out my piece so I don't lose sight of him. Standing in the middle of this aisle, is this old broad, holding this little puppy. He runs right into her. He falls, she falls, the dog falls, it's a fucking mess. I yell out to this son of a bitch to stop. I show him my gun, I don't point it at him, I just show it to him. This prick picks up this little puppy. Now up to this time, see, I can see he's a little hopped up. So I tell him again to stop... - Right. but rather than to comply, he pulls a gun from his waistband. - Fucking junkies, man. So, I take my gun, level it at his fucking head, I mean I got a line on him, what does he do? This prick lifts up the little dog, uses him as kind of a shield, meantime, this old broad's down on the floor screaming "Lucky, Lucky!", which I guess by this time is the name of the dog... Anyway I tell him again, drop the fucking gun, but no... He just backs up. He's taking this dog, he's waving it in front of me, I can't get a clear shot at him. So, make a long story short, I just... shot him through the dog. So, maybe I... capped the puppy, but... but I get the job done. Well, that's what counts. Yeah. That's what counts. I love dogs, Flanagan. But it's a simple case of priorities, yes? Yes. I got something to do tonight, I need a partner. You up to it? - Yeah. Scumbag heaven. Cover me. You're okay, you can stay. The rest of you zipperheads fuck off. Stand up. Move, move! Stand up! Now, what have you got in your pocket? Jealous? - Put it on the table. Put the money on the table. You're an asshole, Frank. - Hey! Show some respect. Now you just lie there. Don't talk, don't move. - Don't even fucking breathe. You want me to read him his rights? This prick doesn't have any rights. I hope you've learned somethin' here. If I were you, Frank, I'd start sleeping with one eye open. You immigrant prick. You threatening me? Flanagan, close the door. Take the gun. Come on, take it. Take it. Take the gun. Watch yourself, Flanagan, he's got a gun! He moves, shoot his heart out. Freeze. Put the gun down. Don't be a fool. Think... about what you're doing. Don't move. Just relax, tough guy. Shut up! Don't tell me what to do, I'm telling you. Don't throw your life away. Don't move scumbag, freeze! What are you going to do, shoot me? - Hey, you... Put the gun down. I mean... Don't be a fool! - I told you to do something. I'm a cop, you fucker! I'm a cop! Okay. 'kay? This greaseball's peddling junk like there's no tomorrow. Fuck this! - Yeah, filth like you... Oh yeah, you sure got him, partner. That you did. Make no mistake. Hell of a firefight. Well I guess I better call it in. Now we're clear on what happened here, yes? Come on, come on, get it together. Okay, okay. I'm okay. Scratch one scumbag. Yeah, Chuckles here is out of commission. No pain, no gain. No pain. Who is it? It's... it's Henry Adler. What do you want? Uh... Could I talk to you? Jesus Christ, Henry, it's the middle of the fucking night. I wonder if I might have a moment? What is all this? May I come in? Why are you wearing that uniform? There's some things that I have to tell you. I'm not letting you in here. I'm not going anywhere until you do. You understand? That's it, I'm calling the police. I am the fucking police. Now that's not necessary. Now put it down. - No. Now... Wait a second, don't do that. I don't want to hurt you, I want to take care of you. Get out! God damn. - You okay? It's okay. Everything's fine, everything's fine. Everything's fine. There's a woman here who was in a little bit of trouble, but, uh, I'm here now, it's all under control. I appreciate your cooperation. - Come on, come on, come on... Get out of here, Henry. Please, sir... I am in control here, everything is fine. Now why don't you just listen to what I have to say? It's all for your own good. The moment I met you I saw your goodness, and your strength, it's what brought me to you. I knew you were something different, not like all the others. Do you understand what I'm trying to say to you? Do you? I think so. My father died, did I tell you that? I'm sorry. Yeah, well, he was... he was sick, he was old, he had a disease. And there's so... much disease around these days. Everyone just, living like the rules don't apply, everyone just looking out for themselves. But it's no good, people get hurt. And the strong persecute the weak, that's not the way it's supposed to be. Killers, pimps, thieves running around like they run the world? Girls having to sell themselves? It's all upside down. And somebody's got to do something. It can't continue forever. Okay, Henry, why don't you sit down. Okay? I don't love you for what you are. Okay, that's part of it, there's something more. I love you for what I think you can be. Maybe you don't love me now. But maybe you could love someone that I will become. I understand. I killed a Vietnamese junkie. It's all about priorities. I shot him in the head. Right here. Henry. You don't see me.... and you don't hear me. I dreamt that we kissed, and then killed ourselves. I worked the whole thing out in my head. I have a gun. Would you like to do that? What? Use it. No. I understand. Hey cutie, hey, come here. Hey! Don't... don't... don't... No, don't, don't just keep your... Don't touch me. Keep... put your fucking hands on top of me. Hey, what is this, a fucking peep show, huh? It's a fucking peep show. You try anything, and the bitch dies. I swear to you! Forget it Anton, it's all over. - It's all over. Over for me, over for her. - Let me go! Drop it. You don't have a chance. - Shoot him! You hear that? You wanna go for it? It's okay, Maria, it's all right. Now look around you, Anton. Look at the firepower. - Flanagan! Shoot him! It's okay, Maria. It's all right. I promise you. Hey, shut up now! Listen! Me and the bitch are gonna walk out of here nice and slow, 'kay? Let me go. Hold your fire! That's right, good boy, very good. Oh no, God, oh no. Oh God, no. It's going to be okay, sir, it's okay, I promise. Somebody call an ambulance! You okay? You saved my life. D'they get him? - Yeah. They got him. Maria. Will you do something for me? Anything. Promise me you'll play Carnegie Hall one day. I promise. I will. So beautiful. No. No! Don't die! You can't go! Please just... I need... No, I don't want... no, I can't... Please!
