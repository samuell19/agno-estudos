(car engines growling) (chattering) (clapping) (energetic jazz flute music) (speaking in a foreign language) (water splashing) Hey, brother. How you doin'? Okay, man. Except I think you got somethin' that belong to me. I sure would like to have it back. (whacking) (groaning) Look what jumped out your pocket, brother. Looks like pure shit to me. Hold it. (coughing and banging) Don't you ever touch me, man. (energetic jazz music) (door banging) (knocking) (grunting and banging) (throat clearing) (speaking in foreign language) (whacking and yelling) (banging) (screaming) (plane engine roaring) (tires squealing) (chattering) (light flute music) You speak English? Yes, ma'am. Take me to Joe's Haven. Uh-uh, no taxis go to yellow section. It's Hong Kong's no-man's-land. Only criminals and gangsters live there. Even police afraid to go there. Well, I'm going there. Can you take me? Well, I'll take you up to where it's safe, all right? Okay, let's go. (light flute music) (traffic growling) [Taxi Driver] I stop here. It's not safe to go any more. Which way do I go from here? The address you seek is over there. Thank you. (light flute music) (car engine growling) (chattering) (crying) (screaming) Stop! Help! Help, help! No, no! (whacking) (groaning) (chattering) You speak English? (speaking in foreign language) Do you know this address? (speaking in foreign language) Come on, fellas, I ain't lookin' for no trouble. (groaning and whacking) (exciting percussive music) (yelling) (fists whirring) (whacking and exclaiming) (wood clattering) (groaning) (whacking) (yelling) (wood clattering) (yelling and whacking) (yelling) (groaning) (whacking) (yelling and whacking) (wood clattering) (knives whirring) (groaning) (knives whirring) (yelling) (yelling) (groaning) (yelling) Stop here. Back up. Hey, sister? You got problems? Thanks, but it's nothin' that I couldn't handle. What are you doing in this part of town? I'm lookin' for a place called Joe's Haven. Do you know where it is? Yeah I know where it is. Come on, I'll drop you. I'm Elaine. Are you new around here? [Woman In Black] Yep. [Elaine] Business with Joe? I don't even know him. You planning on staying around for a long time? Look, lady, or whoever you are, I accepted a ride from you to Joe's Haven, and that's all you need to know about me. Bitch. Let me give you a little piece of friendly advice. Take care of your business, and then get out of here. You know, this isn't exactly a safe place for gringos. You seem to get around pretty good. Yeah, well, I know the right people. Yeah, I can imagine. (slow oboe music) [Woman] Can I help you? I'm lookin' for Joe. (groaning and whacking) (smacking) A lady wants to see you. What can I do for you? You can take me to see Joe. That's what you can do for me. Well, I'm Joe. Are you putting me on? Whoever heard of a Chinaman named Joe? Well I'm only Chinese in body, but my mind is Western. That's why everybody calls me Joe. (smacking) They call me TNT. I'm lookin' for a friend I think you might be able to help me find. I know everybody around. Do you know him? Come on, Joe, his name is Stag Jackson. He sent me your address askin' me to send him some money. Instead, I sent up a piece of my mind. I just want to know if he got it. He never came for it. What do you think happened to him? A lot of guys come and go in this neighborhood. (speaking in foreign language) (laughing) (speaking in foreign language) (smacking) (groaning) Excuse me. (groaning and whacking) (table and glasses clattering) (whacking) (yelling) (smooth flute music) (groaning and whacking) (glass shattering) (whacking and groaning) I'm impressed. It's not bad. Think you could do better? Yeah, I know I can do better. So look, I think you're a fantastic lady. What's your line? You name it, I do it. [Man In Denim] What brings you to this neighborhood? Got you guessing, don't I? Not for long. I got a way of getting in the middle of things, sooner or later. Sounds interesting, but I can save you the hard labor. I'm here lookin' for... A job. She's working for me. You don't expect me to buy that, do you? You got a better offer? Yeah, maybe. It all depends on what you're after. Okay. I heard that anybody with guts and talent could pick up some easy bread around here. I don't care what I have to do, just so long as it pays well. If you're on the real side, I'll keep an eye open for you. I may be able to do you some good after all. Don't do me no favors. Baby, I don't do favors. And when I give, I get. Who is he? Charlie? He's a real bad cat, nothing but trouble. They're inside waiting. Did you find her? Yeah, she's an incredible lady. No problem, though. She's a loner. Not likely she's working for anybody but herself. Are you sure? Baby, I'm always sure. Yeah, I guess that's the problem. All right, what are you trying to say? I'm just wondering if Sid and Ming really appreciate your talents. Don't kid yourself. Sid knows exactly what I'm worth. And who gives a fuck what that Chink thinks? Your friend, Stag, you really want to find him, huh? That's why I'm here. Better watch your step. You do not know what he was into. That's cool. I just sit on my ass and expect Stag to come to me. I look around and see what I can find out. Do you think you can get me an answer by next week? It is possible. But they will insist on cash for every delivery. Hell, that's no problem. I'll pay you hard cash for raw heroin any day at those prices. Do you want to hear what Charlie has to say? Yeah, what is it? I checked out the lady, and I can't see where she'd cause any trouble. That's fine. Ming, you'd better get moving. I want an answer as soon as possible. We have had no trouble for the past six months. Let us not take any more risks at this point. I said I can't see it. (speaking in foreign language) [Joe] Are you the manager? Yes, I am. I need some information. If I could be of any help. I'm investigating about the disappearance of a black American by the name of Stag Jackson. I don't know the name. I was told that he was last seen here. Hey, wait. Yeah, there was a black man that was murdered here right on the stairs some weeks ago. (Ominous Music) (firearms shooting) (firearm clicking) (firearm shooting) (funky music) (chattering) How are you doing? Fine, thank you. Okay. You are now looking at the biggest men in the whole yellow district. They control all the rackets around. You working under their protection? Uh-uh. We have an understanding. I don't meddle in their operation, they don't touch me. This could turn into an interesting evening. Hey, baby. Come on, get off your ass. I got some people want to take a look at you, okay? I don't operate that way. If they want to see me, they come to me. I don't go to anybody. Yeah, that sounds good, but they ain't gonna dig it. I don't care if they don't dig it. I'm just telling you like it is. - You know something? - What? I love your style. Okay, let's forget about that. Do it for me. Sid, this is TNT. Elaine you've met, and that's Ming. (percussive music) Looks like you're giving me some competition. Oh, no, baby, not me. Listen, honey, and you get it straight, I'm not in your league. I work standing up, not on my back. Really? How amusing. I've never really tried it that way. You can relax, honey. I'm not after your slot. I wasn't worried. You don't have what it takes. Oh, I don't know about that, as long as it doesn't rub off. Fuck you. Lady, you shouldn't have done that. What do you expect? Congratulations for bumping heads with the man? (knocking) Who is it? It's me, Joe. The door is open. I blew it, didn't I? (door banging) That's what you call an understatement. How bad? I suggest you finish your bath and forget about your friend. Split before you end up like... Stag? He's dead, isn't he? What are you going to do now? I'm going to get him, Joe. Whoever is responsible. I'm going to find him, and I'm going to bust the motherfuckers to pieces. He was more than just a friend. My brother. (intense flute music) Um, what's going to happen with her? Well, Ming wants to run her out of town, but Charlie thinks she could be useful to us. You know, I just can't figure out what she's after. Do you think she knows that you're in the heroin business? I'm not sure yet, but I'll find out. There's too much competition around here. Can't you get rid of her? And Ming and Charlie, too. In theory, yes, but I need Ming's contacts to get the heroin out of China, I need Charlie to keep and eye on Ming, and the black chick might come in handy. What's gonna happen to her? Well, stalemate for the time being. Charlie's gonna keep an eye on her, and Ming's going ahead with the next shipment. This is the big one. (crickets chirping) (boat horn honking) (intense music) (firearm shooting) (screaming) All of my men murdered and not a trace of who did it. Yeah, well, I'm out a million bucks unless we recover that lost shipment. Got any ideas? I believe the black woman might have some knowledge of this. Well, it's possible. Anything's worth a try at this point. I'll have Charlie check it out. Perhaps I would be better qualified than Charlie. Better qualified to do what, Ming? It seems that your tolerance of the black woman was a costly mistake. What kind of shit is that? - The shipment was hijacked. - Yeah, I'm hip. What I want to know is, why is Ming so quick to accuse T? As you, too, are very quick to proclaim her innocent. Perhaps you place too much emphasis on color. Or could it be that you know something more than you're willing to tell? No, mm-mm, but I got some pretty good ideas. Perhaps you would be kind enough to enlighten us? I think it had to be an inside job, or how else would the hijackers have known where to set up an ambush? And why would they kill every witness? I choose not to defend my honor at this point. You have no choice but to trust me if you are to continue purchasing from my contact. Surely you're not planning on risking another shipment until you find out what happened? I got a quota to meet. I'm open to suggestion. Now, that's good, 'cause I got one. I want in on the next delivery. Well, of course. Then you can share the blame if anything goes wrong. I'll do you one better. I'll take full responsibility. But I want to pick my own men. I want to form a squad of the finest fighters in this city. This is agreeable to me. Good, then it's settled. (funky music) There have been some new developments. You'd better alert your people. Any idea when? No, I think we can hit the next shipment. Where? I'll let you know. Where is everybody? They went to see Charlie about the job. A job? What kind of a job? It seems that the last shipment of drugs was hijacked. That's why Charlie is organizing some sort of a war party. Just to make sure it won't happen again. Sounds interesting. What do you think? Maybe I can join up? Huh, are you crazy? What do you want to do that for? Come on, Joe. I'm no nearer to finding out what happened to Stag then the day I arrived here. Maybe if I get in on the action I might be able to find out a thing or two. Forget it, doll, it means trouble. You gonna take me or not? Uh-uh, count me out. I'm sorry, excuse me. (speaking in foreign language) Well, I'm just gonna have to find my own way. (percussive music) (speaking foreign language) (men grunting) - You got the men ready? - Yes. How many? 10 men, 12 counting you and me. That should do it. Lady, you're full of surprises. How'd you get in here? Ask them. (speaking in foreign language) What do you want here? Got the word you were hiring. I assumed it was an equal opportunity employment. You want to try that again? I want a spot in the new group you're forming. - Where did you hear that? - That's not important. - I want to know. - I'm not telling you. - It was Joe, wasn't it? - He's not involved. I came here for action and not talk. I don't dig it. Why do you want to get involved? A chick's got to start from somewhere, and fighting's the thing I do best. Different. It's way out of your league. Try me, that's all I'm asking. Now, how am I supposed to do that? Let me fight your top man. No way. I'm not leaving until you give me a chance to show my stuff. Okay, you show me your stuff, then you split. All right? Yah! This what you wanted, huh? I said your best fighter. You got him. (exclaiming) What do you say we call it a tie? Do I get the slot? Let's have a drink and talk it over. You didn't say the drink's were gonna be in your pad. Why don't you tell me what you're really after, huh? Just looking to pay my own way, that's all. You're too fine for all that fighting. Where'd you learn to fight like that? When I was a kid, one of my mother's boyfriends was a black belt. He taught me how to take care of myself. Don't you think it's about time you changed your methods? A lady don't need to know how to fight. I haven't found a dude yet that can afford to pay the price. I don't mind paying for something if it's worth it. A slot on your squad, is that the price? I wouldn't waste your time with shit like that. I'm talking about something big. I'm listenin'. How do I know you can handle it? You don't, until you try me. If you're serious, it'll keep. I'll drink to that. She fights as good as any man I've ever seen. So what are you suggesting? She should be eliminated. Now, wait a minute. You get rid of her, they're gonna send in someone else to take her place. Then where are you? Yeah, I think you're right. Give her a rope 'til she hangs herself along with whoever she's working for. Joe, I really need your help. When Charlie's men move out, I want to be around. Uh-uh, that's something you have to work out with Charlie. Not necessarily. Did you ever hear of a thing called spying? Hear of it? I invented it. All you've got to do is find out when they move, and I'll just tag along and see what happens. T, you got a head like a rock. You'll never get away with it. The answer is no, N-O, no. I promise, I wouldn't do anything foolish. Well, in that case, it's your funeral. Charlie's meeting that shipment in the cemetery. (funky music) [Charlie] Let's do it. (engine roaring) (percussive music) (yelling) (screaming) (whacking and groaning) This is trouble, bad trouble. All right, what happened? They got us right after the exchange. Who? I don't know. I never saw them before. Great, just great. You wanted to handle the delivery, assume full responsibility, and now you've blown it. Have you got any more ideas, bright boy? Perhaps after this unfortunate incident you would be kind enough to allow us a confrontation with your friend TNT? If it makes you happy. I'll say she had nothing to do with it. I once knew a magician that could make people disappear. It's gonna take more than magic. Oh no, you're not thinking of... Gettin' rid of her? Do we have a choice? Look, kidnapping is one thing, but murder. It wouldn't be murder, more like self-defense. It's our necks if she gives us away. Baby, I've done a lot of foolish things, but this is too much. (mumbling) Listen, I've got to talk... Back on with the muzzle. No, listen! Save your breath, you're gonna need it. [Elaine] I've got to tell you something that's important. Okay, but it better be damn good. It's got to be alone. Joe, do you mind? Well, let's hear it. First of all, I'm not what you think I am. I know, you're a girl scout working on your badge for the equality of niggers. - I'm a government agent. - Oh yeah? Well, I'm snow white suffering from a sunburn. You're Diana Jackson, age 24, born in Harlem, alias TNT Jackson. When you were 13 years old you were put in a New York state prison for knifing a sailor. Shit! You are a lousy, stinking pig! You're even lower than I thought. I don't care what you think of me. What is important is that I need your help. Me, TNT, working for the pigs? No chance. What if I were able to help you find out what happened to Stag? Stag? What do you know about him? Trouble outside. Charlie and Ming got the place surrounded. What about her? If you say anything to give me away, so help me god, I'll yell "pig" loud enough for all of China to hear. [Elaine] You got no proof. Right now, I got no choice, either. What are you doing here, Elaine? I might ask you the same question, Charlie. The shipment got ripped off. Today's shipment? Yeah, right outside the cemetery. We fear she has something to do with it. I'm sorry, baby, but the man wants to see you. You don't really believe that one woman could be behind a million-dollar drug heist. I had nothing to do with it. Ming feels that she was involved. So Sid wants to ask you a few questions. Well, you go on back to Sid, and you tell him that TNT spent the afternoon with me. I love that. Wait a minute, I'll go with you and tell him myself. Hi, darling. I called the boys off TNT. She and I were together all afternoon. What's the matter? I just talked to Max in LA. He's going to get his quota elsewhere unless we come through with something in time. Ming, I want you to set up another shipment immediately. This time on credit. That would be impossible. The arrangement has always been on cash. Well, change the arrangement. Just get the shipment through, and get TNT. I'll do my best. What the hell's going on? It's about the shipment. I suggest you tell me what happened to it. I know nothing. Perhaps you can be persuaded. Such a waste. Perhaps this will not be necessary. I've never made it with a Chink before. Okay, baby. (speaking in foreign language) Ahh! (shattering) You want it black, you got it black. (mid tempo jazz flute music) (groaning and whacking) (wood clattering) (chattering) (door banging) (oboe music) (speaking in foreign language) You got a long way to go before you catch up with me. 'Cause, baby, I was born beautiful. I don't know, Charlie, it might be worth the effort. You care to expand on that for me? All right, the heist yesterday, it was pretty slick. You wouldn't be thinking of taking over Sid's spot would you? Oh, baby, you overestimate me. Oh, no, I don't think I do. Why don't you be cool, huh? You putting all kinds of ideas in my head. Oh, I'm not saying anything that you haven't already thought of, Charlie. Right. (laughing) What happened to you, man? A slight miscalculation on my part. TNT? She will live to regret this day. Ming, I'm gonna tell you for the last time. Lay off T. I hope I make myself clear. I take my orders from Sid, not from you. It would be a waste. Look, both of you, forget about the black chick. We've got more important things to take care of. Ming, what about your contacts? They refuse. They will not deliver on consignment without some sort of guarantee. It is for you to make a proposal. Something that will meet their satisfaction. Well, tell them anything is acceptable to me. Sid, why don't you meet personally with the supplier? This is impossible. Why, Ming? If you're able to meet with them, why can't Sid? You do not understand. There are many complications. Ming, we don't have time. I will see what I can do. She up and left. Can you imagine? Didn't even say goodbye. Don't even hand me that bullshit, man. Now, where is she? I'm telling you, man, I don't know. And I'm trying to tell you that if Ming gets to her before I do, she's dead. Do you understand that? Charlie, you know me. If I knew, I'd tell you. Okay, let me put it to you this way. (groaning) Why, you! Now, motherfucker, talk to me. And if I don't like what I hear, baby, I'm gonna hang my foot up your ass. Joe. Ugh! You let her go, or I'll kill you. (screaming) If you won't talk to me, maybe your woman will, huh? (Screaming) (easy jazz music) (water splashing) T, it's Charlie. Come on, baby, I know you're in there. What do you want? I just want to make sure you're safe. Ming's out to kill ya. I know. Yeah, I guess this'll do for the time being. Maybe, but I can't stay here forever. I'm already going crazy. You ain't got to worry about it. I'll have you out of here in no time. Come here, and let me tell you something. Everything's working out beautiful. I'm gonna be a big man in this world. I'm about to make that move. And I want you right there beside me. - Oh, yeah? - Oh, yeah. And I'm gonna take care of you, just like I always told you I would. Just what make you so sure that I'm agreeable? You know damn well you agreeable. You'll love it. (sensual jazz music) [Elaine] You're Diana Jackson, age 24, born in Harlem, alias TNT Jackson. "With love, Diana." A gift from an old girlfriend? [Charlie] More like an old enemy. A very old enemy. Diana? I never met the lady. Why, are you the jealous type? Don't tell me you're backing out on me. No. I always stick to my commitments. (knocking) Sid wants to see you, we are moving out. Where? Isla Del Sol. It's a little island just off China's coastal waters. It's Portuguese colony. They have a festival going on there. If you leave early in the morning, you should arrive late afternoon. I'll have to go there to make final arrangements. Angel, this is it. It's the opportunity I've been waiting for. A chance to meet with the suppliers. The whole organization together at once. He's got the lighter I gave my brother. He's the one. He murdered Stag. Joe, I'm gonna kill his ass. You can count me in. He went to a festival on some island. Isla Del Sol. (airplane engine screaming) (upbeat percussive music) (chanting and shouting) (speaking in foreign language) I have arranged for the entire conference room. There will be nothing to disturb us. The festivities will be in full swing by then. Sid, I'm going out for a while. What time should I be back? The meeting is set for 8:00. Oh okay, I'll be back, then. Sure, angel. (shouting and chanting) Tonight, the hotel conference room, 8:00. Everyone's gonna be there from the pushers to the suppliers. So you finally did it. Yeah, I finally did it. What's the matter? You don't seem too happy about it. Oh, yeah, I'm happy. Come on, this is what you always wanted. It's what I thought I wanted. I don't know, Gary, sometimes I wonder if I'm not as bad as they are. Oh, shit! Diana, what are you doing here? Get lost, pig. You can't butt in now. What I gotta do can't wait. We're gonna bust everybody tonight. If you interfere, you're gonna blow the whole thing. You can forget about Charlie. He's all mine. Problem? Yeah, the black chick, get rid of her. She's gonna screw up the whole thing. - Why? - Just do it. (laughing) (speaking in foreign language) What can I do for you? I came to find out about the black girl. She was arrested a while ago. - The black girl? - Yes, sir. I just want to know what I can do about getting her out. I'm sorry, but I think that's impossible. I have orders to keep her in jail until further notice. Could I at least talk with her? Thank you. Baby. Joe! I knew you'd be here to get me out. It's not that easy, honey. Joe, you've got to get me outta here. Let's see what I can do. I have to find a... Find a way. I'll see you tonight, baby. Joe! (horns blowing) What do you think of this one? Forget it, angel. You're not going anywhere. What are you talking about? Does this answer your question? (smacking) What about her? We'll take care of her after the meeting. Get rid of him. (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (chanting) Joe! Am I glad to see you. I found Charlie. He's at the (chanting drowning out speaker). They're all here now. We can begin. (intense percussive music) (groaning and whacking) (moaning) (smacking) (jazzy synthesizer music) (whacking) (speaking in foreign language) Their minds are made up. They do not wish to risk another shipment without payment. They say there are many others that are willing to pay cash for their merchandise. That's a damn good point. Sit down, Charlie, you're not helping matters any. I'm not trying to. I'll buy from you. I got the money. To start off with, I want two deliveries. I'll pay you in cash. You. You ripped off those shipments. That's right. You dirty black bastard. (shouting and whacking) From this day on, you deal directly with me. Agreed? I might have something to say about that. My friend, who gives a fuck? (sharp flute music) (shouting and smacking) (chatting) (smacking) (whacking) (glass shattering) (screaming) (percussive music) Baby, I'm glad to see ya. Everything back there got all screwed up. But now that you here... (slapping) Damn. T, what the hell did you do that for? The name is Diana Jackson. TNT to you. (shouting) (percussive music) (whacking and groaning) (shouting and smacking) (screaming) (shouting and whacking) (slow jazz music)
