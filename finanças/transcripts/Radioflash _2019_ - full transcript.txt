Real food. Yeah, I figured you were due for more tonight. Mm. I needed this. Yeah. Me too. Hey, Moon Brines, mom loved those. Your mom would eat mold off the kitchen floor. She'd eat anything ghoulish. She'd eat pickles, she'd eat okra. Oh, she'd braise it. Ugh! What's that? It's, like, frying, but you have the lid on the pan. Made the whole house smell for weeks. It was disgusting. So, how's the game comin'? Slow. Zeb's trying to help me but I just feel like programming languages are so antiquated. Oh, so you're more like Jobs than Woz. Exactly. Like, I can picture it in my head but.. What was that? Oh. You okay? I'll go get a flashlight. Or, we could do that. Weird. I... I don't have any service. Hmm. Looks like the whole neighborhood's out. Lucky your iPad wasn't plugged in. Still no internet. So frustrating. Oh, come on. It's an adventure. And a much needed break from this. Uh, it's not about that. It's the fact that I can't get answers. Answers to what? To this blackout, whatever it is. I think I saw some books in grandpa's shop. Something about power walls, power lines. Yeah, look, your grandpa, I can take in small doses but you are gonna have to stay a little more grounded. You got enough alternate reality as it is. It's not alternate, it's virtual. W... well, it's.. This is torture. Wow. Wait, is that permanent? Yeah. He had that mustache for two weeks. I bet his mom loved that. Here, let me see this. Oh, so now you wanna see? Well, if we're lookin' at photos I think you can cut me some slack. It's kind of analog. Don't you think? - Mm. - Mm. Mom looks so young. Yeah, we were. I didn't even have a car. Your mom had to take me to work pick me up from work. Ah, that's you. Our little larva. That's what your mom would say. Our little larva. For like three months, you didn't move. The only thing that would move is your eyes. You'd just sit there like this. Your mom used to call it your larva stage. She looked so cute. - Reese.. - You're right. We need a break from this. It's hard for me too, sweetie. "Radioflash. "The phenomena known more widely throughout the world "as electromagnetic pulse or EMP. "The term originated in the early 1950s "primarily associated with the click "typically heard on radio receivers when a nuclear bomb was detonated." Okay. See the solution, not the problem. Here goes nothin'. Yes. CQ-CQ-CQ. This is kilo-whiskey-6-charlie calling CQ-20 CQ-20. CQ-20, hello, CQ, this is kilo-whiskey-6-charlie standing by. It looks like the entire western grid took a hit. I hate to put forward a worst case scenario here, but, uh evidence seems to suggest an Electro-Magnetic Pulse. You're just now figurin' that out? - Chris? Chris? - Grandpa? Reese. Honey, is this you? Yeah, grandpa, it's me. Oh, so good to hear your voice. Are you alright? Yeah, grandpa. We're fine. Good. Listen, Reese, this, this.. You got a blackout down there, right? Is, is... is it a radioflash? It's been a long time since I've heard that term but, yes, Reese, that's exactly what this is. How did you know that? I found one of your books in the shop. I need to talk to your dad, Reese. Is he there? He's asleep. Well, it's not a good idea to have you on the road anyway but I'm gonna need you to get up here to me. Both of you. First thing tomorrow. I know he's gonna have a lotta questions but you got to promise me you'll get him on the radio first thing in the morning. Okay, I promise. While we're on.. You're gonna need some things for the road. Do you think you can get 'em together for me, Reese? There's a cabinet right in front of ya. Third drawer down. A boundary county map with a highlighted route. I got it. There should be a short range radio right there on the com bay in front of you. Is... is it there? Short range. Only five miles tops and I know you've been here before but without that GPS it's gonna be hard to find so y... you got to radio me when you get in range and I'll guide you in. It's probably gonna need to be charged too, that radio. So you, you've got a charger on the generator. You know how to charge our generator.. Generator? Oh, you got to be kidding me. Reese? I... I got it. Good. Now.. - Grandpa? - Yeah? Should I be scared? You're gonna be fine, Reese. We got a plan. Okay, copy that. Um, I'll call you tomorrow. I love you, Reese. Be safe now. What the shit? Why don't you try those shelves behind you? You're lookin' for opiates, right? I'm lookin' for penicillin. You might want to try those shelves behind you for oxycodone and morphine. Go ahead. Yeah. Dad. Dad? Hey. Still out. What about your cell? No service, but I talked to grandpa. What? I called him on the radio in the shop. I'm confused. So the shop has power? No, I... I used a car battery and some cables. Grandpa said that this is really serious. We need to head to his house. He wan... he wants to talk to you right away. Okay, j... just slow down. Honey, okay? First of all, we're not going to your grandpa's. Second, coffee. You don't have to believe grandpa. It's all right here. "Radioflash." That's from the shop? Hmm. Look, I respect your grandfather. Without Frank and this house who knows where we would have been with your mother's medical bills. But, we're not gonna just throw common sense out because he thinks the world's gonna end. And what if it is? Then we're all in the same boat. Yeah. A boat that's sinking. Uh.. It's gonna be a long day. Grandpa? Grandpa, can you... can you hear me? Reese? You there? Yeah. Grandpa, it's me. Hey, Reese. You got your dad there with you? Yeah. Here, one sec. Hey, Frank? Chris. Good to hear your voice. Now I know what's going through your head right now but you've got to trust me on this one. Uh, sweetie. Will you give me a minute with your grandpa? Thanks. Alright, Frank. It's just the two of us. What's goin' on? It's an EMP, Chris. It's devastating. It's wiped us out. Wiped out the entire Western United States. - Chris? - Yeah, I'm here. Um... what do we do? You get here as fast as you can. You've got to get ahead of it. You can't stay in that city. Those city slickers are gonna be scattering like cockroaches. Some will be headed your way, most will be headed for the hills but you got to get ahead of it. You got to move. How much gas have you got in your car? Half a tank or so. Well, top it off with what you've got there in the shop. There should be a couple of containers in there. Frank, did you plan this? How did you know Reese would find the radio? Shot in the dark. I figured one of you would remember it was there and if she hadn't of, I'd be headed your way right now. Believe me. Frank, you sure about this? I've got everything we need to weather it here long term. It'll be a safe place for you and Reese. I promise you that. This is the real deal, Chris. The clock is tickin'. You've got to get moving. You hear me? Okay, we're on our way. Thanks, Frank. Over and out. Alright. Everyone just calm down. Alright. Take a breath. Looks to be a pretty standard power outage. Oh, standard my ass. And if those main transformers are out it's gonna be two years at best. And I'm sure that there's contingency plans for this sort of thing. Right, officer? The only plan you got to be concerned with is how much food, fuel and water you got. I give another 24 hours before the shit hits the fan. You ain't got to take my word for it. Everything you need to know is right here. Why don't you fire that thing up and see what the boss has to say. That's what I thought. It's probably best you don't think. - Huh? - Easy, Stan. This is a slippery slope, son. Before you know it, it's... it's martial law. Best thing you can do is go back to your homes wait it out, we'll get the power back on before you know it. Stay hydrated, get your flashlights and candles ready just in case it's a couple hours but it won't be more than that. Okay? Everything's fine. Reese, you ready? Whoa. Everything's shut down. I thought all the stores were closed. This one happens to be the only store open. People seem a little worked up about this. Whoa! Okay. Careful, sweetie. A lot of people in here. Remember to get water, okay? Hey! Hey, come back! Hey! No, guys, one line. Oi, you don't need that much popcorn! Stop. Let go! I got kids at home! We've got to go, sweetie. Come on. How you doing? Nineteen percent. I keep hoping grandpa's wrong. Means that he wasn't so crazy after all. Ah, hang on a second. What is this? What's this? This is really bad. Is there another way? On the other side of the mountain. We should try it but it will add another hour at least. Yeah, we don't know how bad those roads are gonna be. Thank you. Mother Earth... forgives us and who gives us the... the land the earth, the rain and all living creatures. Teach us to... have respect have the heart to never take more than what we give. To only take what we need. Teach us. Thank you. Ugh! Thank you. Come on, I'm tired of waiting. Let's go see if we can help. Come on. Come on. There's cars as far as I can see. We should be careful. - Mom, I don't know.. - I'm gonna drive. Oh. Sorry. Alright. Honey? - You're not taking my truck! - Just get out of the way. No, just wait. Wait, wait here a second. Hey. How's she doing? Got a pulse? Back to the car, now! Let's go. Reese! You okay, sweetie? I'm sorry you had to see that. People behaving like animals. She died, didn't she? Yeah. Wait. What mile marker did you see last? 126, I think. - I think we missed it. - Missed what? The turn off. Like, five miles back. Oh, what? - Aah, dad! - Aah! Dad! Reese? Reese. Reese. Reese? Hey. You okay, sweetie? It's dad. I'm here. - Honey? - Oh. It's okay. Don't ever do that to me. You had me scared. Oh, sweetie. What? Where are we? We took a little crash. You got a little bump on the side of your head here, sweetie. You were out most of the night. We're just a little ways off the road, okay? So we need to get our stuff, get out, get some help. - Where's the radio? - Reese. - Where's the radio? - Just take a breath, okay? Your adrenalin just spiked. You need to slow down. Grandpa's been waiting for us all night. - He's probably freaking out. - Grandpa is fine. I'm worried about you. Reese. - Grandpa, can you hear me? - Reese. Grandpa, it's Reese. Do you hear me? Reese. Four miles, remember. He said four miles. W... we're too far out. What was the last mile marker we saw? Uh, 126, I think. Okay, that means we're by the falls. - Falls? - Kootenai Falls. Okay. Alright, honey, try your side 'cause I can't get out this side. Oh, perfect. Okay. Come on, let's go. - You're bleeding. - Where? Oh, no, it's nothing. Just a little bashed up on my left side is all. - Grab my bag, sweetie. - Uh-huh. Yeah, thanks. I'm gonna grab the compass off the dash. Okay. Grab that canteen, babe. Give me some of that sweet water. Uh, that is the best toilet water ever. Okay. Let's have a look at this map. - Where's the river? - Right there. There. So we're like.. Oh, t... twenty miles away, sweetie. Well, I mean, that's if we take the highway. If we stay on the river, that will shave off, like five miles. - There's a bridge we can cross. - Mm. Well, I don't know about you I've had just about enough of the highway. You wanna take our chances with the river? What do you think? Yeah? How far is that bridge? Uh, it should be pretty close. Maybe we should have just stayed on the road. The road is far gone now. Besides, we've got to keep moving. Can you please let me have your bag? No, come on. Dad, I'm serious, stop. Okay, alright. If you insist. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Dad. The bridge. What are you doing? Coming. Huh. Good job. Good job. It's beautiful. Works like a filter. The Native Americans used to use this stuff for, like, everything. I mean, it's edible, it works like a medicine. Moss? Here, you try it. You need to stay hydrated. Okay. It works. Dad, are you okay? No, stop. I'm okay. I'm okay. - Let me look. I have... - Stop, stop. - Let me see. - Honey, honey, no, no. No. Some things don't have an answer. Look, sweetie.. You were born in a different time than I was. Anything you wanna know at the end of your fingertips. Sometimes things just don't make sense. I don't know why your mom was taken from us the way she was. What I do know.. Is that she would be pissed off.. If she thought we wasted one second of this life one moment. It's about this. It's about the forest. Trees. The moss. It's about us. It's about you and me together. Now you, you tell me. You tell me how the Native Americans used moss for medicine. Okay, but you have to let me see first. Okay. But, uh, it looks worse than it is, okay? Oh, no, no, sweetie, it's okay. It's okay. Daddy's okay. It's, it doesn't hurt. - Reese. - What? Give me... give me... Give me a hand. - Dad. - Reese, get help. No, I'm not gonna leave you, dad. Stop. Dad? Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Somebody help! You two have been through a lot. His body's just trying to regain some of what it lost. You come up from the city, I take it? I imagine things must be getting pretty ugly out there. Well, I take pause in saying it, but.. Some of the folks around here welcomed all that wreckage. But they don't want city folk up here especially in times like these. I can't say I blame them much. You see those mountains over yonder? They call that the Yaak. That's real backwoods territory. Trappers, old gold-rushers even some outlaws hiding up there. Folks got another thing coming if they think they can just run for them hills. Boy, this, uh this power outage, whatever it is.. It really did a number on all of us. Marilynn, my wife.. She's stuck in North Carolina at her sisters. Luke, my son.. Well, we.. We haven't heard from him in over a decade. Yeah, when he was your age he spent almost every waking hour out there in the pasture riding horses. Whew. Some days the memories just kind of knock the wind clean out of me. - Here, let me... - No. I'm gonna get some fresh water. Don't worry. I'll sit with him. No! He... he... he just stopped breathing. Okay, let's have a look at this map. This is where we are. And this is where your grandpa is. I never have been able to figure out those smart telephones. We never dreamed of such things when we was kids. Yeah, I guess us old fogies just carry on like we used to. Those mountains sure are pretty, huh? You know, they say there's only.. Two kinds of mountain people. Those chasing a dream.. And those who are being chased. My folks was being chased. Come up from Oklahoma. Dust Bowl run 'em out. Well, they were some of the lucky ones to leave when they did. You know, over 7000 people lost their lives. Dust pneumonia. And it always puzzled me because.. Our folks taught us that we was created from dust and to the dust we would return. I never figured on dust being the killer. My point is.. If both life and death is dust.. There ain't no use in worrying which side you're on. Hello? What's this fella up to? Reese, you better get in the back, just to be safe. I mean it, honey, get in the back. You stay out of sight. Thanks for not running me over. People don't seem too keen on picking up strangers around here. Well, I guess you found the dumb one. What's the trouble? Well, just a little lost is all. - Where you headed? - Lewiston. Lewiston. Well, that's about 60 miles... This is a pretty handy little camper you got back here. Yep. How much fuel you got in this thing? About half a tank. That's not too bad considering. - Son, what do you want? - Get out of the truck. What? I asked you nicely, now get out of the truck. Okay, alright. Alright, alright. There's no need for that. - No need for that. - Now, get out. Listen, son, you don't wanna do anything stupid. Okay. You got to pay to play, baby. Okay. Oh, look at her eyes. Ain't she pretty? Who are you? Well, I think that's a hell of a question for you to be asking me. Uh, now, just a minute. - You are in no condition... - No, you don't understand. Take a seat, young lady. Now, it is incumbent upon me to remind you that you was trespassing on our land. Now I am willing to forgive the intrusion but I am not willing to forgive in your trespass the insult to us by denying our hospitality. So, why don't you just sit tight do us both a favor, and let Maw put supper on. Oh, Reese. Uh. Mm. Don't be shy, honey. Go on, eat up. First time tasting bear? Ain't no finer meat than bear. Closest kin to a bear is the pig. Both smell as bad too. What's your name, honey? - Reese. - What? Reese. Reese? No, no. That's a good name. This is my son, Bill and that's my grandson, Quinn, over there in the corner. He'd as soon tear meat with the coyotes as sit upright at a table. Ha. Well, now that we all know each other why don't you tell us.. What you and your daddy were doing nosing around our property? - He's not my dad. - Oh? I don't know who that man is. Well, why were you running with him then, hm? I... I wasn't. A... a guy, a farmer named Glenn he was driving me to my grandpa's house and that man waved us over. I hid in the back of the camper and he stopped and then I heard a shot. I didn't move until we got here. Wow, Bill, seems like you was justified in killing that man. Hmm? What was you doing out here in the first place? The power, it's out. - The power in the city? - Everywhere. All the stores were closed. There was no food or water. Why, see, that's why we live in the woods. Power ain't the problem for people out here. Well, you're safe now here with us. No, you don't understand. I can't stay here. I have to get to my grandpa's house. I guess you expect us to take you and suffer the same fate as that farmer. No, I... I can go on my own. Oh, what? And run off in the night? You think that man was a predator? You just wait till them wolves smell ya. You'll be dead so fast you won't hear your ghost screaming. Why, the way I see it my son saved your life. And you could do us a favor by well, relaxing into the courtesies that we're offering. There's a cot in the attic. You can sleep there tonight. Where are we off to? Billy, she's runnin'! Billy! Go get her, boy. What do you want from me? I said, go get her. Just get away from me! Get away! You a caterpillar now. But come morning, gonna be a little butterfly. Butterfly. Get away! Bring me the girl. Ah. There you are. It's alright now. You come here and sit with Maw. I made you some tea. You like rocking chairs? They're my favorite. Don't use 'em no more on account of my knees. Go on. Give it a little push. You can go now, Billy. Go on, Billy. She ain't goin' nowhere, son. She'd just as soon be in hell with a broke back then be locked in that cellar again. Ain't that right, Reese? Here, drink your tea. Now, ain't this relaxin'? While the world beyond them trees is burnin' we're sittin' here havin' tea. What do you suppose them city folks is doin' right now, hm? You think they're helpin' each other? Makin' a plan? Hm? Well, my guess is.. It's just about separatin' the wheat from the tares. And maybe the tares is overcomin' the wheat. Hmm? One thing for certain. Half of them ain't never gonna make it to harvest. Why are you keeping me here? It's called tough love, Reese. Reese, I do like your name. Now, what do you suppose would've happened if we let you run off the other night, hmm? Well, let me tell you. Instead of draggin' you out of the cellar today we would have been layin' your young body in a grave. Minute I saw you I knew you belonged here. Uh, no, it ain't no coincidence that a lovely young lady like yourself stumbles onto our lonesome path. You have no idea how hard it is watchin' those boys grow up with no companion except a crippled old woman. Just ain't right. Now, you can decide for yourself what kind of folks you think we are. Whether we're the type that takes or the type that gives. And if you believe the latter well then you are home. But if you believe otherwise unfortunately, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Now, you can decide to join our home or you can decide to go back.. Into the cellar. So, what's it gonna be. Hm? Hmm? I'd rather be back in the cellar. Billy! Billy! Billy! Wait, wait. Grandpa? Can you hear me? Grandpa, it's Reese can you.. Can you hear me? One of these days, that boy's gonna hit you back. Your name's Quinn, right? Look, Quinn.. I really need your help. I got to get out of here. H... how would you find your way? I have a map. You could come with me. You'd be safe. Look, Quinn, do you know where the key is? Pa keeps it with him. That can't be the only way. Carpenter ants. This wood is rotted. Look, Quinn, can you find a rope? I'm right underneath you. Are you okay? Come on. We got to go fast. Grab the rope. Wait, wait, stop. I want to try my grandpa. Okay. It's almost dead. Hey, grandpa? Do you read? This is Reese. If you can hear us we're... we're by Pack River. Please just.. Please help. - It's dead. - Come on. We got to keep moving. We can't stop here. Let's go. I'm sorry. Let me take your pack. No, I got it. Rest here a minute. Wait, where are you going? You're weak. You need food. I... I saw some berries. I'm gonna go get us some. Wait here, I'll... I'll be back. He got you good. Your eye. Yeah. I... I'm used to it. Don't hurt much anymore. It's okay. I just want to see. See what? You. You clean up nice. Do you recognize where we are? I think this bend in the river is just downstream so we're probably here. Wow! We're way closer than I thought. I think we'll make it. What is it? I can't go with you. What do you mean? Because he'll follow us and he won't stop until we're both dead. When we get to my grandpa's, we'll be okay. He's not like your dad. He'll take care of us. Wh... why would he take me in? Because you saved my life. And you risked yours trying to do it. Let's go. We got to keep moving. Take my hand. We'll cross there. It's the only way. Nice and easy. Take it slow. You got this. Okay? Come on. Watch your footing. Don't look down. Keep your eyes on me. Almost there. - What are you doing? - It's throwing off my balance. - Here, give it.. Oh! - Oh! Come on, we got to go. Wh... what, what is it? Come on, we got to keep moving. Let's go. Stay close. I'm not afraid anymore. Grandpa. I got you. It's okay, sweetie. You're alright. We're gonna get you home now. Grandpa had his ideas about why it happened. Said it was a false flag an inside job. Who knows? He was right about one thing. We had everything we needed. He'd even retrieved my backpack from the stream got my iPad and phone working again. We took our shifts chopping wood pooled up our food supplies and did what any family would do in our position. We survived. Where's Quinn? And while I found my way back to the real world Quinn was finding his way of escaping it.
