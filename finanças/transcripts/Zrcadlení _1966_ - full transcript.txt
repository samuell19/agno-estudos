REFLECTION Mr. Sladek, wake up. Mr. Sladek! Well... Take a nice deep breath. I am. Breathe really deeply, huh? Yeah. What's your name? What's your name, sir? You're Sladecek. In my opinion, one should live to the fullest, everyday, without excessively philosophizing on the meaning of life. We should strive to avoid thinking about death. And eventually prepare for dying in a calm and rational manner. And always keep the spirit balanced. Mr. Sladecek! Are you awake? Only just, huh? Take a nice deep breath. And tell me your name, huh? Sladecek. - Sladecek. And your first name? What did you say? Karel? Yes, right. I see, you can remember your name. Now, take another nice deep breath. Yes, it's just a little bruise. Nothing serious. But open your eyes wide. Yes. Open your eyes. Put your hand like this. Breathe deeply, huh? Take a nice deep breath. C'mon! No more sleeping! C'mon. Tell us your name? What's your name? What's your name? Mr. Mertl, try to lift your head a bit. As high as you can. Nicely. Yeees. His pulse is still slightly irregular. And tell us what's your address? Can you remember? Can you? Open your mouth. Open your mouth nice and wide. Stick out your tongue. A nice deep breath. Nice and deep! Yes. Right! After patients arrive in the hospital, especially the younger ones who were healthy before, often they realize only at this point the value of life and the joy associated with health. It's a sick person who especially realises with full force and clarity the beauty and joys of a fully-fledged life. It's also remarkable that in the hospital many sick people experience a shift of values. Things that mattered greatly before are now perceived as petty and insignificant. On the other hand, things taken for granted are suddenly perceived as a great gift in life. I wish to live because I want to take part in raising my grandchildren. Your first grandchild? - No, second. From my second daughter. And you'll take care of them. - Yes. What's death? I don't know because I can't define life. But I think death is part of life. Without death, life would become completely pointless. I don't fear death because I think so far I've lived... or... I mean, so far I've stayed healthy. I don't need... Actually, it's all strange to imagine one's own death. What's death? I can reply as follows. From a medical, an expert point of view, death is an irreversible collapse of all the vital processes and functions. Well, as to fearing death? It's hard to respond. Maybe, from my personal perspective, I can say I don't fear death. Death is cessation of material existence. So, are you awake, Mr. Micka? Tell me. - I am, nurse. Does it hurt? It does. What's the time? Any idea? It's about 9 AM. Do you think so? You said, it's 1 hour after the operation which lasted an hour. So, it's 12 PM. And does it hurt a lot? A lot. Well, it'll be much better. You'll get a jab soon and it'll vastly improve. Hope is the last thing that dies in a person. In my view, the question of meaning of life is somewhat pointless. Because the word "meaning" is itself a rather vague term. I think that life is supposed to be lived and in this dwells... to use the word "meaning", in this dwells its meaning. There is no other, concocted, otherworldly "meaning". Life has to be lived. Death is just a deadline. No need to fear it. What might fill us with fear is life itself, or maybe some of its parts. Does it hurt? It doesn't, doctor. Or maybe a bit directly in the wound. - And from the backside? No. Isn't it sensitive? - No. Only in the wound. - I see, it might still hurt. It needs patience. You look good today. - Do I? Am I paler, doctor? - You are. You have a fresh look due to a sound sleep. Mhm. I need a drink. I'm still thirsty. - Did you have any pain? I feel rather dizzy and nauseous, doctor. Okay. But no pains anymore? After the jab, the pains receded, right? After getting Dolsin, I feel great relief, doctor. So, it improved substantially, huh? - Yes. As I observe in the hospital every day sick and dying people... I see the meaning of life in the following... we should oppose individual selfishness, in all its manifestations, be it displayed in others, or within oneself. And we should strive every day to be, in relation to a suffering person, a help. You know, in my life, or my profession, I encounter a lot of pain and suffering and it makes me think that people tend to complicate their lives with petty issues and unnecessary troubles which can be easily solved. With my upcoming operation, I realized how ephemeral life is. After getting a jab, I was falling into the darkness. And then, after waking up, I felt so happy that I'm going to see my children again. You know, how to put it... any long-term illness, or any illness that... most probably - even in the opinion of a patient - won't bring a happy ending... so, such a patient will certainly, at one point, ask his doctor, "Why me? Why has this suffering been inflicted on me?" He might be convinced he never did anything wrong to anyone. So, why is it him who is being punished for something? Then a doctor finds himself in a really difficult situation because doctors are not trained nowadays to provide some kind of all-embracing consolation. Many times I used to think, as there are already so many different misfortunes in the world, why do people embitter their lives even more with troublemaking, mutual hatred, envy, and all the other negative aspects of social coexistence one can encounter? The person who is optimistic to the point of looking at things through rose tinted glasses, he then has to deal with a huge mental downfall when he, for example, gets to know he has been diagnosed with an incurable disease. He faces the fact and... knows his prospect is, let's say, six or eight months of slow dying and... someone who has become immersed in the idea of the rosy tinted world of constant improvement, where everything only gets better and better, can't cope with it. But the most important thing is not to be preoccupied solely with oneself. This seems to me as crucial. Not to think solely of oneself and one's suffering. Once thinking is no longer egocentric, fear of death is gone. It dissipates. The biggest adversary of modern life is fear. Fear is naturally given to a man but the excess of fear we observe in modern society is debilitating, it hurts him, and is... in brief, cruel. Well, I think the most important thing is to stay healthy. Because a healthy person has no reason whatsoever to be unhappy. But... I know many people who are physically perfectly healthy and still lack happiness. However, I don't consider health as the goal of life, but just a means. Often, we've to ask question, if this particular means is used rightly, and for what purpose it's being used. Life has to be lived in a day-by-day perspective... so to speak. Every day, every period of life, should contain certain pleasures, goals, fulfilment. If one is incapable of finding a purpose to the present moment, the present activity, the current work, if this is missing, then, in such a case, it's a clear hint that a person aspires to becoming psycho-neurotic. The loneliest people I can ever imagine are alcoholics. Their ultimate destination is usually the closed ward of a psychiatric hospital. You know, these people wanted to buy happiness in life, and the whole purpose of their life, very cheaply. People don't drink because they want to satiate their longing for alcohol, or selfishness. It's rather that the alcohol releases their tension which arises from unsatisfactory relations towards other people. Well, in my personal view to live a happy life one needs to have around one some friends... in whom one can have full confidence. There should be... some kind of mutually warm relationship. To have friends who are absolutely reliable. Among these friends I also count relatives, wife. One should live some kind of happy private life. Without something like this, in my view, one can't go on for a long, I guess. You know, I think that for most people it's essential to feel needed. They need to feel - for some other people, or some community, or whatever - somehow indispensable, somehow useful, to be appreciated. Well, there might be some people who don't need it, who are able to be on their own, to be happy without that, but such people are rare, I expect. Nowadays, the way of life... I mean, here or anywhere else... is very tiresome and hectic. Thus people seek release valves. They're looking for an escape route, for something meaningful, something of value or merit, for a place to take a refuge after all the labor and rush. I believe the greatest... or hitting a jackpot is if two people can get along. Usually, a sense of meaning is brought into my life with moments or experiences that come all of a sudden, mostly without planning, that leave long-lasting impressions. I'm not happy with my life because it seems to me it lacks some kind of fulfillment. It seems to me, I live without perspective and isolated from other people. I can't get closer to someone and at the same time no one can get closer to me. I feel a certain distrust... towards people, and in general towards things, towards my own acts, and acts of other people. What's the goal of my life? I want to be a valuable member of society. I want to be able to do good deeds in my life. What's are your fears... in life? What should we all try to avoid in our lives? We should steer clear of wrong responses in various circumstances. We shouldn't hurt others. Because it's in our nature... we tend to hurt others and at the same time to feel others are hurting us. In my view, one of the... things in life that might have a negative impact on a person is a lack of interest of other people about that person. While speaking about values... I'd say, there are certain values that are worth living for. And, those are? Those are... love, beauty, to understand people and to like them. What's dangerous? Dangerous? Loneliness. What's unbearable? Unbearable? At times, others. I'm convinced that an individual in a society can't exist as a separate unit. And... as the best human trait I consider love. Of course, I deny the soul's existence but everything that a person manifests or all we can observe about him is an expression of his inner life. You know, if I could recall my mom then... well, then... just to recall her... I'd never do what I did. I did such a stupid thing which I deeply regret and which... the last thing I remember is the blue sky above me. I can't even recall how it happened. I just know when I woke up I saw huge rocky hills stretching above me and those were people. What I value most, maybe friendship. I came to the conclusion it's the only real value. Overall. Interpersonally. It's not love, but friendship. Why not love? It seems selfish to me. What kind of friendship? Full of freedom, of equality, completely independent, or... without any limits. Or what shall I say? Or I don't know. I'm still too young. I'm still looking for a clue to what keeps people afloat. It's beyond my grasp. Sometimes, I tend to think it's because they can repress thinking. Somehow, they're thoughtless... the beings who live without reflecting on their lives. I lack confidence and I am afraid to be with other people. It's more bearable to be alone than to be with other people. With people who make me suffer. Anyway, whatever. All this talking is annoying. Well, yes, it's annoying. I'd prefer if there would be something... maybe it's feasible, well, to have a device attuned to brainwaves or something, and the other person wouldn't need to speak and we'd communicate directly. Because words are often inappropriate. At least, in my view. Maybe others are fine?! Well, from a medical point of view, we can only reduce the burden some people carry. But to decrease the incidence of suicide, or neuroticism, as we used to say, would be possible only... with overall, a general improvement... with a better social cohesion, better interpersonal relationships. Well... it's one of the problems of modern psychotherapy. In the past, we believed a person could be thoroughly reconfigured. Today, we're much less ambitious. We're just trying to assist people, so they can live rationally their individual lives, regardless of the assets, they acquired in the early stages of their childhood. In my view, it's very important for everyone not to be overly afraid and to be moral. Fear is our natural predisposition. Intentionally inducing fear in others is a crime. What's a human? I prefer not to specify. Oh, vanity, I was so unprepared. I was fleetingly touching all the ordinary things from all the sides. As if searching was supposed to proceed into the future.
