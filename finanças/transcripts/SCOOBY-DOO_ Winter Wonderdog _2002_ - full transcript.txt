I like Uncle Scooby. He's silly. Freddy, I'm so glad you brought your friends here to help the children - put on our Christmas pageant. - Glad to help, Mrs. Fezziwig. I think everything's finally set up. Not quite. Look at this antique nutcracker. Yeah. We got to find a neat place for it. After all, The Nutcracker Suite is always part of our pageant. What's that, Teddy? Teddy thinks it should go on the very top of the Christmas tree. Why, Tiny Tina. What a good idea! Yeah! Teddy and I will put it up. Perfect! It really brightens up the place. And I'm closing down the place. Winslow Nickleby! Whatever are you doing here? As you know, Mrs. Fezziwig, this building used to belong to my family. So, I've come to buy it back. Today. But it's Christmas Eve. Christmas Eve, is it? Bah! Humbug! Humbug! But we're prepared to make a most generous offer for this building. $5,000. $5,000! That's chicken feed. We're not selling. It's out of the question. Yeah. The kids like it here, mister. So you'd better leave. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah! Hey! Look out! Bah! Humbug! I'll get this building back, one way or another. That mean old man wants to throw us out in the cold. Don't worry, Tina. There's nothing he can do. Right. And besides, we have happier things to think about. Yeah. We have a show to rehearse. Costumes, everyone. Yeah! Oh, boy! Costumes. I want to be a reindeer, or a drummer boy, or the abominable snowman. But I don't want to be a sugar plum fairy. I feel ridiculous. But it's a Christmas show, Scrappy. Now, Shaggy, you play Scrooge and Scooby's The Ghost of Christmas Past. All right, give Scooby his cue. Like, bah! Humbug! The Ghost of Christmas Past is coming to haunt me. I said, "The Ghost of Christmas Past is coming to haunt me." Where's Scooby? I'm coming, Freddy. I said, "The Ghost of Christmas Past..." Wow, Scoob! What a keen costume! I'm over here, Shaggy. If you're here, then who's he? I am The Ghost of Christmas Never. Hey! That's not in the script. He's a real ghost. Run for it! - Hey! I thought the show must go on. - Yeah, but without us. Hi. We're Santa's elves. Have you been a good little boy? You'd better not shout 'cause Santa Claus is watching. And you're leaving town. Bye-bye. Zoinks! Head for the North Pole. - Where's the ghost? - He must've ducked back inside. - Then let's duck in after him. - You duck. We're chicken. Yeah. Come on, chickens, we're going to scratch around for some clues. - I don't see that old ghostie. - No, but look at that. Oh, my goodness! Who would do such a thing? I don't know, but we may have a clue. This lapel pin has initials on it, W.N. W.N? Winslow Nickleby. I knew it. That mean old Scrooge. I think we'd better pay a call on Mr. Nickleby - and find out about this ghost. - Oh, no! Not ghosts. We're not going anywhere near Nickleby's place under any circumstances. Right. Too bad. Mrs. Muffinstuffer, the Nicklebys' cook, baked some cookies. Cookies? Cookies at Nickleby's. What are we waiting for? I think you've said the magic word. Hi ho, horsie! Whoa, horsie! Hello? Mrs. Muffinstuffer? Yes. You must be from the children's home. - Right. We came to pick up the cookies. - I baked nine dozen. We'd better bake some more. I am so, how you say, upset. Nanette! What's wrong? Oh, excuse me, I am Nanette Musette, the maid. - You are from the children's home, oui? - That's right. Then I must tell you, Mr. Nickleby, he is up to something fishy. What do you mean? He is in the library right now, hatching the nasty scheme to take over the children's home. He mustn't know I told you this. We'll sneak around front and listen in. Come on, guys. Just a minute. Get ready for the attack of the gingerbread men. Now you're cooking, Scoob. Your uncle's will clearly states that he left behind a priceless emerald at the children's home. Those foolish kids don't have the slightest idea, they're sitting on a fortune. The trouble is, you can't legally force them out of that home. Who cares about "legally"? They won't want to stay there once our friend gets through with them. Did you hear that? It sounds like he's in cahoots with the ghost. And he's after an emerald somewhere in the children's home. - We'd better get a look at that will. - Leave it to us. Us? Why always us? Who is it? Chimney sweeps. Chimney sweeps? But I didn't call any chimney sweeps. Blimey, governor. You didn't have to call us. We can spot a dirty chimney a mile away. - This is an outrage! - I'll say. It's the worst I've ever seen. Yeah! Disgusting! Look out, Scoob. - That tickles. - Stop this! You're making a mess. I dust, okay? Say, "Cheese." There you go, she's clean as a whistle. But you've ruined my home. Don't worry, governor, we'll send you the bill. So long. What's the will say about the emerald? - I don't know. I can't read the fine print. - Here, let me try. It says. "On Christmas Eve, your goal's not far. The emerald rests in the pageant's star." That must mean the Christmas pageant's star. Hey! I remember seeing a stage prop up in the attic, a golden star. The emerald's probably in it. Come on. So, where's the star, Daphne? - In that cupboard over there. - Great! Let's get it and get out of this creep zone. Run for it! Not out there. - It's drafty out here. - Out here? - Oh, no! Help! Help! - Oh, no! Help! Help! - Help! - Help! What's so funny? Nothing, I just have a loony sense of humor. Hold on, guys! We'll save you! Hey, wait a minute you! Trying to steal the star attraction, eh? Finders keepers. Geronimo! Oh, no! See? We told you Santa Claus was coming. What'd you bring him, Santy? He brought you a huge golden star. Right in here. Really? Gotcha. - Good work, Scoob! We've got the ghost. - And the star. Let's tell Daphne and Freddy. - We bagged the ghostie. - Yeah. - That Christmas creep has disappeared. - Ghosts are good at that. But we still have the star. And inside... Rats! There's no emerald inside. - Now what'll we do? - How about clearing out for starters? - Mr. Nickleby? What do you want? - This building. And now I have the power to take it thanks to my old friend. You mean you know the ghost personally? What ghost? I'm talking about my old friend, the City Building Inspector. He's granted our request to have this place condemned. What? You'll have to be out first thing in the morning. You have no choice but to sell out to me. - This document's real, all right. - This is awful. One thing's for sure: We can't let it spoil Christmas for the kids. Daphne's right. We've got a show to put on. Oh, thank you very much. Nanette, it was so nice of you to volunteer to take tickets. The pleasure, she is all mine. This looks like it'll be your most successful Christmas pageant ever. Humbug! Monsieur Nickleby. I did not expect to see you here. I wouldn't miss this for the world. I just love a farewell performance. Now, Tina, do you know what to do? Yes. When I hear the finale, I make my big entrance from the rafters. It'll slay them. - Ready, guys? - Hoist away, Daphne. Here it goes. And now our show begins with the classic ballet, The Nutcracker Suite featuring, The Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairies. Hey! Watch where you're going. Isn't that wonderful! It's the Nutcracker, the star of the show. Of course. The will said, "The emerald is found in the pageant's star". That's the Nutcracker. - What did you say? - Nothing, excuse me. Out of my WBV! Hey, what gives? - You're going to give me the emerald. - But, I don't have it. Daphne! Help! I'm trying-. I told you, I don't have the emerald. Drat! Help! Snowball! Daddy! - Somebody save my poor little kitty. - I'll get him. Here, kitty. Hang on, Tina. Here's your kitty, safe and sound. Snowball thanks you, child, and so do i. We'll be right back. You've ruined the ballet, Mr. Nickleby. But I had to find that confounded emerald. I thought it was hidden in the Nutcracker. The star of the show. Maybe it is hidden in the nutcracker. The real, antique nutcracker we put on the tree. It's the ghost. It's mine. Stop that ghost! - He's getting away! With the nutcracker! - Let's move out, guys. Now this is getting exciting. - Where are they going? - I don't know, but we're going there, too. Taxi. Quick! Follow those skiers. This way. We'll head him off at the pass. Put the pedal to the metal, Charlie. I think this was a bad idea. I've lost them now. Neato! Out of my WBV! Don't look now, Scoob, but there's a stampeding horse at 6 o'clock. - Scooby, you've got to try to stop. - I'll try, Daphne. Whoa, Nelly. - Good going, guys. - Rough going, you mean. The nutcracker. Look! It's the emerald! And now, we'll unmask this Christmas creep. Nanette! You! With that emerald it would have been Christmas every day. So, when Nanette overheard Nickleby talking about the emerald, she decided to steal it for herself. - But what about the lapel pin, Daphne? - We were holding it upside down. We thought the initials were W.N. for Winslow Nickleby. But they were really N.M. for Nanette Musette. Merry Christmas, everyone. Mr. Nickleby? What's gotten into you? Thanks to you folks, Snowball and I have found the Christmas spirit. We have gifts for everyone. And here's the best gift of all, the document condemning this place. I hope you'll stay here as long as you like. Hey! This present's for me. It's Uncle Scooby. I love you, Scooby! Uncle Scooby. Hi, I'm Scrappy Doo. Scrappy Doo? Let me at him! Let me at him! Let me at him! Let me at him! Puppy power! Scrappy Doo? Uncle Scooby? Mush! Wow, Uncle Scooby, isn't Alaska fun? Yeah, fun! I can hardly wait to start digging that gold! Scrappy! Keep your eyes on the road! Look out, Scrappy! Sorry, Shaggy. Sorry, Uncle Scooby. On Donner, on Blitzen! Santa? Like, let's start gold digging. Good idea. I'll build a sluice! How's this, guys? Wow! - Scrappy sure doesn't waste any time! - Yeah. Boy, oh, boy! We're going to be rich! Like, I hope things pan out that way. Get it, Scoob, pan out? Yeah. I hope nobody tries to steal our gold! Don't worry, Scrappy. Sled dogs are fantastic guard dogs. They're not afraid of anything. Shaggy! Help! Relax, Scoob! This thing has been frozen for a million years. See? Zoinks! It's alive! I knew it. A claim jumper! Okay, buster, put them up! Hey, let me at him! That was close! Ski for it, Scoob! Hey! We're running away from him! Scrappy's a fast learner, Scoob! Way to go, pal. We sure fooled him! Yeah, we did! We lost that mean old claim jumper. But I'll get his attention! Scrappy! No! No! - See? Here he comes! - And here we go! Don't run, Shaggy. Let's fight! Come out where I can see you, and I'll splat you! - Scrappy! Oh no! - Oh no! Did you call me, Uncle Scoob? Way to go, Scrappy! His bark was a lot worse than his bite! Puppy power! Scrappy, no! He's still coming. I've got an idea. Good! Look out! He's coming back! Easy, Scoob! We showed him, Uncle Scooby! Like, every coward for himself! There's only one sure way to catch a claim jumper and that's with a Scrappy trap. All it takes is a little string, and a lot of snow. I think we finally lost that buck-toothed beast. Here we go again! Shaggy, look! It's a Scrappy trap. But, for once, we'll let the bad guy get caught in it! Here he comes! My trap worked! I got the mean old claim jumper this time, Uncle Scooby. Uncle Scoob? Shaggy? Uncle Scooby! Where's that mean old claim jumper? He's right behind us! Shaggy! This way. Hide, Scoob! Yoo hoo, Mister Claim Jumper! We got him! We did? We froze him stiff. Boy, I guess we really know how to handle claim jumpers. He never really scared me. Shaggy! He was just a pushover. Right, Scoob? Yeah. Scooby-Dooby-Doo! Oh, no! Help! Professor Kreuger sure must want to see us badly to fly us all the way to the North Pole. I wonder why? I don't know. He said it was too important to tell us in his cable. Zoinks! Look down there! Where? Where? Those are totem poles carved by the Eskimos, Scooby. And the biggest I've ever seen. Let's take a closer look. There it is. The Eskimo village where Professor Kreuger is waiting for you. You'll need your skis to get through the snow. Right and thanks. Let's go. - Come on, Scoob. - Who, me? Jeepers! What a blizzard! I don't like the looks of this. Me, neither. Professor Kreuger? Professor Kreuger! - Zoinks! Look at that! - llgloos smashed to bits. Yeah, as if some giant monster stepped on them. Giant monster? Come on, Scoob. Hold it, you two. We've got to find out what happened to the Professor. We'd better split up and search the igloos. You go inside, Scoob. I'll stand guard. You go inside. You say something, Scoob? Speak up, Scoob, I... Run for it! He's got us! He's got us, Scoob! Help! - That sounds like Shaggy. - Come on. Let go of me! Let go! - What's happening? - The bear. Bear? That's a fish. A fish? The Eskimos hang them up to dry. I didn't know they washed them. Looks like someone was fixing dinner. It's still warm. Whoever it was sure left in a hurry. Maybe we can pick up their trail. Come on. Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy! Shaggy? Shaggy- Help! Help! What happened, Scoob? You mean you saw a giant paw print? Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! - Where, Scoob? - Back there. We'd better take a look. Jeepers! Whatever made these prints must be 50 feet tall. Oh, no! The monster's coming after us. That's no monster. It's an Eskimo with a dog sled. Dog sled? Who? Me? I am Manook, Chief of this village. - What are you doing here? - We're friends of Professor Kreuger. - Where is he? - The Snow Beast carried him off. Snow Beast? It smashed our igloos and drove off my people. But what is this beast? Why did it attack? Our ancient legends say the Great Beast comes to life, when man invades the sacred lands of the North. Comes to life? The Great Beast was angered when we built our village on sacred land. Now we must go or the Snow Beast will destroy us. You must go, too, before the Snow Beast comes back. - You heard the man, let's get out of here. - Not so fast, Shaggy. I know. I know. - There's a mystery to solve. - There's a mystery to solve. Oh, boy, I knew you'd say that, Velma. I'm going to go to igloo. Just a minute, Chief. Where did the Professor have his headquarters? In Quonset hut there. Thanks. I think we'd better check his hut for clues. Anybody home? Sorry, mister. The Chief told us we might find out what happened to the Professor if... The Professor is gone. Another victim of the Snow Beast. All that remains is our work. - Who are you? - I was his assistant, Jean Pierre Baptiste. I must go now before the creature comes back. I recommend, for your own good, that you leave at once. Wait! Can't you tell us... Not exactly the friendly sort. Yeah. Come on, let's check out the hut. Keep searching. There must be some clue to tell us why he sent for us. Food. Help! I think I've found something. It looks like a drawing of those totem poles we saw when we flew in. Exactly. And I'll bet that's what the Professor saw when he... - See who that is, Scoob. - Okay. It's for you. It's the Snow Beast! Everybody run! Hide! No! Help! He got Chief Manook. We'd better get the Chief's dog sled and go after him. Right. It's our only chance to save him. Scooby, take charge of these dogs. Right. Forward march! - There they are. - Jeepers! They sure are big. Look at this. Black snow! I wonder if... Listen, what's that? The totem pole's heart is beating. It's alive! Jeepers! That's weird! How could a totem pole possibly have... - The Snow Beast! - Run for it! Scooby Doo, where are you? Over there. He's heading straight for the Snow Beast. Look out. Scooby is trapped. Help! You fooled him, Scoob. Come on down, Scooby, and hurry. - He's too scared to come down. - And he's turning into a block of ice. Scatter! Scooby is frozen solid. How do you like that? She thawed him out. Yeah. We'd better hitch up again and follow that Snow Beast before his tracks are covered up. We've been following these tracks for hours. Look. The tracks lead into the ice cave. Hey. This must be his lair. Come on. Suppose he's hungry, Fred, and thinks that we're people-burgers. That's ridiculous, Shaggy. This is our only chance to save Manook and the Professor. Let's go. This cave goes on forever. Watch your step, this ice is really treacherous. Oh, no! Help! We'll never get out of here. We're doomed, doomed, do you hear? Yeah. We're not through yet. If I can lasso that ice up there, maybe we can climb out. Terrific, Fred, you did it! You're the lightest, Scoob. Shinny up that rope and then tie it real tight for the rest of us. - Too fat. - Come on, Scoob, will you quit clowning. It's the Snow Beast. Now we're really trapped. Our only chance is to find another way out. Let's go. Look. The eyes of the monster. Relax, Shag. It's just a pair of lighted tunnels in the ice. That's strange. What would electric lights be doing in a Snow Beast's cave? Okay, we'd better split up. Shag, you and Scooby take that tunnel, we'll take this one. Fred, there's no way you'll get us to go down that spooky path. No way. Not even for a Scooby snack? Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Somebody must've carved these tunnels out of solid ice. - Jeepers! Look at this. A submarine. - Hidden beneath the Arctic ice. And look at this, more black snow. I think these clues are finally beginning to add up. Right, we've got to find the Professor and Manook before the Snow Beast finds us. So far, so good, Scoob. Jump for your life! Quick, Scooby! Do something. Oh, boy! That ought to hold him. Well, well, what kept you, Mr. Beast? Come down here, so we can check those pearly whites of yours. Open wide. Not bad for a Snow Beast your age. - But they do need cleaning. Toothbrush. - Toothbrush. - Toothpaste. - Toothpaste. See you in about six months for a checkup. Something tells me we're getting closer to... Help! What's that? Help! It's coming from in here. - The Professor! And Chief Manook! - You found us. - What happened? - I can't remember. It's all blank after the Snow Beast took me away. Help! - Shaggy, Scooby? - Where have you two been? Oh, boy! Don't ask. Come on. We've got to get the Professor and Manook back up to the surface. We made it. Now all we have to do is capture the Snow Beast. Is that all? If someone could just lure the Snow Beast onto this patch of slippery ice, he'll be helpless. Any volunteers? Way to go, Scoob. Here they come. Just as we thought. A hidden oil derrick. And the Snow Beast was a mechanical monster. Run by Baptiste, the Professor's assistant. Once we put the clues together, it was really simple. Baptiste came across the black snow while doing research for Professor Kreuger and he realized there was a huge oil pool there. And because it was on Eskimo land, he took advantage of their legend about the Snow Beast to scare them away. Then he and a driller from the Alaskan pipeline built the derricks during the night, disguised them as totem poles... And began smuggling oil out beneath the ice in converted submarines. The Professor became suspicious, so Baptiste carried him off with his Snow Beast and locked him up just like Chief Manook. And I would have made millions if it hadn't been for you meddling kids. - We're ready to take off. Where's Scooby? - He's fishing. I got a bite. Scooby Dooby Doo! Here we are, Wolf's End Lodge. - Like, it even sounds like a wolf. - That is a wolf, silly. Wow! What a run-down and creepy place for a weekend of skiing. I know, but it was the only place we could find. Come on, let's go in. Welcome to Wolf's End Lodge. We have all the comforts of home. Yeah? Whose home, Dracula's? It's cold out there. Excuse me for interrupting but could you put this suitcase in a safe place for me, Mr. Greenway? Certainly. Certainly. Nice doggy. Nice doggy. Who's that? That's Mr. Leech, another guest. Now, if you will be so kind, I'll show you to your rooms. This is the young ladies' room. The other rooms are across the hall. And, yes, a word of warning. Be sure to lock your doors and windows before you go to sleep. Lock our doors and windows? Why? Because if you don't, the Snow Ghost will get you and turn you into ghosts! - Snow Ghost? - Turn us into ghosts? Ghost? Well, it's time to turn in. Before we go, we'll make sure the windows are all locked. I'll check it. It's locked. Zoinks! The Snow Ghost! Run! That Snow Ghost is for real, all right. Look at the size of those footprints. Now what are we going to do, Freddy? Get a couple of snow cars and follow those tracks. I want to find out about our mysterious guest. Oh, boy. This ski trip's turning into a real scare trip. Boy, that Snow Ghost sure gets around. The tracks end at the edge of this chasm. Well, if he tried to walk across, the first step is a doozy. The Snow Ghost! And he can fly! Duck! There he goes! Flying across the sky! He disappeared behind those trees. And that's where we're going. Come on. - This is where he went. - But no Snow Ghost. Look! There's a cave with a light coming from it. - Maybe that's where he lives. - Well, there's only one way to find out. - Go see if he's home, Scoob. - Me? Sure. You can run the fastest if he's there. - Now, cut that out. - My leg, my leg! Oh, brother. Scoob says the coast is clear. Come on. What a strange cave. Yeah, like furnished in early Chinatown. This stuff isn't from China, Shaggy, it's from Tibet. Well, it's for sure the Snow Ghost doesn't live here. Then who does? Maybe if we ring this gong, we'll find out. Who dares enter the Temple of Fu Lun Chi? I know this sounds silly, but we were following a Snow Ghost. Yeah, and we thought he might have come in here. Like, I don't think he believes us. I know you speak the truth, for I am the one the Snow Ghost seeks. - You! - Yes. Many years ago in Tibet, I came face to face with a beast known as the Yeti. I leaped across a wide gorge to the safety of a narrow ledge! But I had not seen the last of him. His ghost returned to seek revenge and I was forced to flee for my life. And now after all these years of hiding he has found me once again. It's the Snow Ghost! Do not be alarmed. It is only the white timber wolf. - White timber wolf? - Yes, he's my friend. I feed him and he protects me. - All he wants is his bone. - Bone? I have a hunch this Snow Ghost is after something besides you. And we're going to find out what it is. Do you believe that story Mr. Chi told us? Well, right now it's the only story we have. Hey, wait a minute. Stop! There's some more of the Snow Ghost's footprints. And look! They're covered with sawdust. Sawdust? Maybe he works in a meat market. Well, where there's sawdust, there's usually a sawmill. And I'll bet that's where we'll find those footprints came from. Come on, you scaredy-cats. Scooby, that's just your reflection in a broken mirror. Velma? Shaggy? Velma? Shaggy? - Scooby, help! - Velma! Quick, Scooby, cut the chains. Get a bigger saw! Scooby! - Quick! Make like a beaver. - Beaver? You did it, Scooby. Scooby Doo! Help! Give me back my glasses. - Dynamite. - Dynamite? And after Scooby picked the lock on the chain, we came right back here. Now all we have to do is find Shaggy. Shaggy! He's been turned into a ghost by the Snow Ghost! Shaggy! Shaggy! Shaggy's not a ghost anymore. - I'm not? - What happened? I don't know. All I remember is fainting at the sight of Mr. Hairy Scary and waking up as a gooney ghost. You must have been sprayed with some white stuff and the water washed it off. Wait a minute. If the Snow Ghost didn't turn you into a ghost, maybe he's not a ghost either. Then he must be for real. Run, everybody! - Like, thanks a lot. - Sorry. Keep running! He's right behind us. Quick! Get behind those logs. Well, we lost him. Yeah, but we lost Daphne, too. - I'm in here. - A secret, hollow log. That's not all that's in here, look. Diamonds and jewelry! But what are they doing hidden in that log? I think I'm beginning to figure out this kooky deep-freeze mystery. While you put two and two together, we better find Shaggy and Scoob. Scooby, this is no time to be a back-seat driver. Hurry! Turn left! Turn right! He's right behind us! Now he's in front of us. - Head for the ice, Scooby. - Ice? Ice! "Dan... "Danger!" Danger! "Danger thin ice." Wouldn't you know it. We're frozen like a couple of popsicles. But at least we're safe from that creepy Snow Ghost. We're on a ski jump! Quick! Make like a bird. Lucky we found you two or you would have been stuck till the spring thaw. I'd rather be stuck here than with that Snow Ghost. Speaking of that gooney Snow Ghost, what are we going to do? Catch him. This quick-freeze worked on Shaggy and Scooby, maybe it will work on him. Come on. - You all set, Scooby? - Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Okay. When we lure the ghost past here you take the lid off the bucket and dump the water on him. Then he'll freeze into a block of ice. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! And like, just to make sure you don't miss, here's a couple of Scooby Snacks. Scooby Doo! It's the Snow Ghost. And he's trying to throw Scooby off the ledge! I'll save you, Scoob. - Mr. Greenway! - Mr. Greenway! Have I got a headache. I've got to hand it to you kids you've uncovered one of the biggest rings of jewel thieves in the country. Those two were the masterminds of the ring. Leech over here, would bring the stolen jewels to Greenway in a suitcase. Then Greenway would send them down the river and across the border, hidden in these hollowed-out logs. To scare people away, he disguised himself as the Snow Ghost. He got the idea when Fu Lun Chi told him that wild story. Yeah. He even made it look like he could fly. How did he do that? Transparent plastic skis. They're almost impossible to see at night. Show them, Scooby. Scooby Doo! Scooby Doo... Scooby Doo!
