(inaudible background conversation) (melancholy music) (upbeat music with eerie undertone) (melancholy music) (phone rings) - I'll get it. Hello? - I have to talk to you. I'm just across the street from your house, but I saw Matthew go out just now. I would come right over, but your cleaning lady's there. Get rid of her, I must see you alone. Do you hear me? - Yes, I hear you. - I must talk to you at once. - Yes. Good morning. - Good morning. - My husband? - Oh, he's gone to the refinery. He'll be back this afternoon. - It's important that I speak to him. - An hour and a quarter to get there, mmm, you could try calling in about an hour. Would you like to wait in his office? - No, thanks, just tell him I'm on my way there, will you do that? - [Woman] Senora? Are you feeling all right? - Yes, thanks. (ominous music) (tribal music) - Help? It has broken down! (inaudible dialogue) Do you want me to drop you somewhere? I am going to Marrakesh on this road. Come in (tribal music) That is very nice of you Don't mention it You work at (inaudible) American? What? You work at (inaudible) American? Yes. (inaudible dialogue) Is there really oil here? We are trying to see if there is. Have you been here for a long time? No, just one week We are almost there, so you can leave me here. No no, I will take you to your destination. And if you would like... (inaudible) (inaudible dialogue) Who lives here? Three women. Alone? Yes. There they are. Where is the third one? The youngest girl -- ever since the grandmother's daughter -- her mother -- died, she stays in her room and is never seen. And the other one? She is the governess, she takes care of everything. Iâ€™m sorry that I cannot invite you to meet them, but today is the anniversary of Mrs. Sunni's death She is buried here in the garden and I came to bless her grave. Thank you! - Don't mention it. Goodbye. (light piano music) - Good evening. - Good evening. A whiskey, please. (light piano music) (man speaks French) - Whiskey. - Evening, the hotels are really depressing at night. I'd like to see the town but I don't really know it yet and I thought if we were alone, we could-- (man speaks French) Do you speak English? - Yes I do, but I'm not alone. (light piano music) Good evening. A taxi, please. (man speaks French) (kids chatter in French) (men speak French) (kids chatter in French) - Come on, give me $50. - Why? - You took 100. My client told me. Okay, do what you like, I just want you to know I'll never set foot in here again and neither will they. - Did you enjoy yourself tonight? - No. - But you came here anyway. - All in a day's work. - Mmm. - Shall we see each other all night? (Arabic music) (man speaks French) (exotic music) - Hello. - Sweetie, you're late. They've already started. - [Nina] An American friend of mine, Matthew. - [Man] Oh, how do you do, come in. - I thought he should see your dancers. - Of course, please, sit down. You know the rules of the house so I'll leave you to it. - Thank you. (exotic music) Aren't they charming? - Them, oh, yeah, yeah. - Hello, Nina, try this one. - Hey, ciao, Bernard. (exotic music) Don't worry, it's on the house, they're the best you can get - [Matthew] I'm sure. - [Nina] Don't you like it? - [Matthew] No, no, no, it's not that, I just prefer more natural highs. And you promised to come back to the hotel afterwards. That stuff makes you weak kneed, you know. - Yeah, but it removes your inhibitions. - Ah. - Okay, I'll get you something to drink. - Thank you. (exotic music) - Hey, careful with your knees. - (laughs) Just enough to remove my inhibitions, thank you. (exotic music) - Did you like it? - Mmm, oh, yeah, beautiful, fantastic. - They're thanking you, Khanna says you're very pleasant. - Me? - Khanna would like to make your acquaintance. - Where's Nina? - She left, she was tired. Khanna would be so upset if you left. - Eh, which one's Khanna? - Him. - Him? - Isn't he beautiful? Come up to the sitting room. Sit down, make yourself at home. And I bid you goodnight. (exotic music) - Yes, yes, I know. - Hi. - Hey, hello, just a sec. (Nina speaks French) Hello. - Oh. (laughs) Thanks a lot for leaving me in the lurch last night. - Did you enjoy Khanna? - Hmm? - I told you it was a place for the things you would like. Khanna's very attractive. - I left right after you did. - No, you stayed and enjoyed yourself. Gallay was watching, he sends his compliments. - Wait a minute, wait a minute, you mean to tell me that old guy was-- - That old guy does no harm to anybody. - Oh, yeah, except maybe to Khanna. - That's a problem you should have told her last night. - Well, Nina, come on, I was stoned on hashish. - There's no need to make excuses. Matthew, listen, I must go now, I've got some deluxe tourists. - Wait a minute, wait a minute. You think we could get together this evening? - I've already told you, at night I'm-- - Oh, yeah, sure, sure, I know, I know, I know. You get cozy with any stranger that comes along and you take the money and get your cut. Okay. How 'bout I pay you for an evening? Consider it a business proposition. - If you think I'm offended, okay, it's a deal. - I'll expect you in the bar at nine o'clock. - Okay. - (speaks French) You will be punctual. (light piano music) - Matthew. - Hmm. - Nina couldn't come, she sent me in her place. - Oh. - May I sit down? - Oh, yeah, sure, sure, sure. (light piano music) - What are we gonna do? - Anything you like. - Ah, let's hear what you have in mind. Playing around or belly dancing? I'm sorry, I'm sorry, why couldn't Nina come? - She had to see her father. - Ah, yeah, she coulda invented a better excuse than that. - I assure you, it's true. - Yeah. - Nina said I was to take her place for everything. Of course, if you're not game. - Oh, well. I mean, you are very pretty. In fact, quite beautiful. (laughs) You sure you aren't a boy? - Are you kidding? (Matthew laughs) - Ah, want a drink? - Why not. - Waiter, please. - Hey, Matthew, Matthew, hang on a second. Hold up, buddy. - What? - You get laid in Marrakesh? - Oh, Jesus, give me a break, I just got back. - Well, did you meet anybody? - Yeah, gorgeous brunette. - Ah, they're all dark. - Oh, and a blonde, too, eat your heart out, buddy. - In the bar of your hotel? - Yeah. - Italian? - I don't know if she was Italian, I didn't ask. - Oh, one that takes you out and has you spend your money. - You know her? - Nina? Course I know her. She's the one you find in the bars at the best hotels. She charms the shit out of you and give you the impression that she's available, know what I mean? Hey, wait a minute, don't try and tell me you made it with her, because I wouldn't believe you. - Ah, what is she doing down here anyway? - Her father's in jail and she wants to be near him. - In jail? - He killed his wife, Nina's mother, and that's the reason, being in jail's a pretty tough thing unless you got bread. That's the reason she's always out there hustling money any way she can. Except for one, you know what I mean? Unless she gave you special treatment. - Come on, what is this special treatment? She ditched me the minute I looked away. - Where? - In the hotel bar, why? - Usually it's the house of an old faggot, one who gives her money when she brings clients there. She invite you there? - No. Oh, come on, don't fuck with me. (man laughs) (string music) (both speak foreign language) (eerie music) - Mr. Sami. You're the only one who uses our library. - Ah, that's not true, there's a lot of interesting crime stories, but the ones we have, they've already read. You should do something about that and find new ones. - You know I always buy them when I can. - There are other books, it's a big library. - I'm not even sure the regulations permit crime stories. Well, what did you bring him today? - If you want to see it-- - Oh, don't open it. Omar will see to it, it's his job. I leave you in the good company of your books and your daughter, au revoir. - Sir, about that favor. - We'll see. - Omar, all right with you if I give this to Hassan? - What is it? - Wuthering Heights. It appears to be a good translation. - [Omar] I don't know, could it be subversive? - Nah, not a bit, don't worry, he'll probably never read it. - Omar, let me visit in his cell. - No, I can't. - Come on, 10 minutes. (suspenseful music) Was there a movie last night? - Yes, an operator, all in Arabic. - I saw one once, I nearly died laughing. - Oh, thanks. Did you bring cigarettes? - You smoked the others already? - You mean now you're counting them? - No, I wish you wouldn't smoke so much. - Did you speak to the warden? - Yeah, he says he's got to think about it. It's only three months since your last parole. He's got to think about the others. - What others, that's ridiculous, he's not the one who runs this place. - It's more money he wants. - Then pay it, or are you becoming a miser? - Oh, that's great, me a miser, I'm trying to save, that's all. Omar wants more too. - How do you know, did he ask? - Not in so many words. Didn't you notice? He always locks the door, well, he didn't today. Tomorrow I have a tour with a group of Americans. With a bit of luck, I have the money for your pass before long. Takes patience. - Yeah, patience, patience, patience. - Don't bruise me, I have to work. - Nina, who are these American tourists you're taking around? - A couple with three kids. - It's always wholesome families you get, isn't it? - The agency chooses, not me. - Why don't you admit it? - What should I admit? - Tell the truth, where do you really get the money? - When you talk to me like that, I hate you. - We're done. - You asked me for a book, here. For somebody who blows up embassies, I suppose the choice isn't the best. - What's it about? - A love story, beautiful. - You are in prison because of love, you are ridiculous, pathetic. - Hmmph, I call myself a hero. - Hello. - Hi. - How's it going? - No complaints. - [Matthew] Bonjour. - Hey, Matthew. - (laughs) I've been waiting for you for an hour, you're neglecting your work. - And what about you? - Oh, well, you know, the president of the Kellogg oil company is coming to Morocco and we have to give him a welcome present and I thought maybe you could give me some advice. - And they asked y to buy it? - Well, they actually, it was a colleague of mine, but I convinced them to let me do it. - How much do you want to spend? - They said a handsome present, I mean, after all, he is the president of a multinational, eh? - Back as soon as possible. - Sure, go ahead. - I can't do it for any less. This piece is over 300 years old, it's very rare. I am giving you a very good price. - Seems more like 50 years old to me. - Ah, it's for the wife of the president. The price is fine. - No, wait, I know it's not your money-- - Ah, I trust you, I was gonna go to the goldsmith at the hotel because it was guaranteed, but the young lady here insisted that I come to you. In fact, she practically forced me. Can you give me a bill with a receipt on this? - Of course, sir. - Thank you. - You know, you have done me an enormous favor, much bigger than you think. - It's the Kellogg oil company that's paying. - Money's very important to me. Maybe one day I'll tell you why. - Okay. - Shall we have lunch together tomorrow? - Ah. You don't have to feel obliged. - I don't feel obliged. - Yeah, it's fantastic, it's like Islam. No, a scene from a Hollywood movie. I may be an Italian, maybe. - Tell me about it. - What, you've never been there? - I was just a child, I think I remember Milan a little. - That's it? - No. - Listen, I'd like to make you a proposal. We knock off work at noon Friday. I can be here the following morning. There's a lot of things I'd like to see and I'd like you to be my guide, professionally speaking, of course, I mean, after all, one tourist is as good as another, eh? - I'm leaving tomorrow. - Where are you going? - Out of town. - You know what you are? You're a mirage, you asked me to the house of this Moroccan friend and you disappear. And then you make a date and you have a girlfriend take your place, then we have lunch together and now you say you're leaving. - Well, so far... (eerie music) - I was drunk. - Yeah. - [Enrico] Good morning. Am I disturbing you? Are you the gentlemen who was asked to find a gift for your visiting president? - Yeah. - My daughter hasn't spoken to you about me? No, instead she's talked about you to me. Even if I had imagined you quite differently. Can I sit down, Mister? - Jackson. - Oh, Mr. Jackson, thank you. So. Yes. I had imagined an older gentleman, white hair, a bit of a tummy, a cane, just as I was expecting to find a Mrs. Jackson, are you married? - No. - They decided to let you out today? - Yes, and believe me, I got here just as quick as possible so I could thank your friend. After all, if it wasn't for his generosity, I wouldn't be here. You see, Mr. Jackson, it concerns a special parole. When someone behaves well, they let hm out for one week or two depending, but not for good conduct. Do you understand what I'm getting at? Well, there's not always sufficient money. A few days ago, Nina said we need a stroke of luck. (laughs) And so you have been our stroke of good luck. - You should have waited. You're not supposed to be on the street without me. - But I couldn't bear it inside, not a moment more. - When they let you out, I'm responsible for everything. - Maybe we should bring your friend up to date. Did you know that I'm serving a sentence for homicide? - Yeah, I heard. - Oh, that's a relief. Did you tell him, Nina? It's always quite traumatic to have a father in prison. - Nina didn't tell me anything. - Ah, no, it's either very moving or very shameful. Why didn't you tell him, Nina? - I didn't want to. - No, don't be in such a hurry, let me enjoy this charming view. - Let's go. - Ah, there's something too. Just beautiful, emotion like the sea, ever changing, do you understand? - I'm sorry, forgive me. - When will I see you again? - Oh, I'm so sorry, I thought we could all have dined together, myself, you, Nina, and Mrs. Jackson. - I-- - Why here? That's a nice buildup to the showdown, plenty of irony, then silence, then violence and now? - What about the married couple with three kids? - Anybody else would say thank you, it was because of Matthew I had the money, otherwise you wouldn't be here. - I said thank you, you heard me. - No, you never-- You insulted both of us. - All I did was behave like a worried father with a daughter who lied, now hang me for that. - Such a performance, it was awful. God knows what he thought, he has more class than anybody. - How decent is he in the sack? - For your information, I have no intention of going that far. - What proof do I have of that, huh? - None whatsoever, you have to trust me. - Great. - Believe what you like, I wouldn't go with someone else the same day they let you out. I'm free to do what I want when I want, day and night, remember that. (melancholy music) What are you doing? (ominous music) You're crazy, you want to kill me. (melancholy music) - I want you to hear my plan. You see, I have a confession to make. Those sedatives they pass out in prison, I have nearly a full bottle. - And so? - The little bottle gives me a sense of freedom. In jail, you spend a good bit of time thinking of a way out. - Oh great, in other words, what you're saying is, if I leave you, you get your solution. - If I ever find out you and him-- - Will you stop it, eh? - It should be here. There it is. (Nina sighs) - Hassan, know him? (man knocks) Hassan? - He's my brother. - And you, what's your name? - Hadija. - Here. - Thank you. How did you meet Hassan? - In prison. - Why were you in prison? - That's my business, do you want to send any message to him? - No, is he well? - Very well. - Tell him his tongue is sweeter than the honey of the bee. Is she your wife? - Right. - She's pretty. (ominous music) - Good evening, mademoiselle, good evening, monsieur. - Hello, Sarah, good evening. Now what? - I'm going to see granny. - You be sure to give her my very best. - I'll go and prepare dinner. - Sarah, how is Mama doing? - Same as usual. - Well. Well. And what does she do all day? - Nothing. - What do you mean nothing? There must be something she does. - She prays. - Ah, Madame Moretti speaks to God, spends her days praying. An authentic Christian, huh, pardoning those who sin against her, let's not pretend already, I know. (sinister music) Listen, I want your grandmother to confer with my attorney. - When? - Right away, tomorrow. - You know she doesn't want to see anyone. - If we continue to wait for her to call him, I'll die in that prison. For you this is normal, you're used to me being locked in a cell, but I'll never get used to it. - All right, Enrico, tomorrow we'll call him. (Nina grunts) You mustn't touch me in this house. You know I don't want it. - Afraid of the old lady, huh? Or is it your mother's ghost? (Nina grunts) - No. (Nina grunts) No! (Nina whimpers) - Did you call, mademoiselle? - No, leave us. (sinister music) My grandmother doesn't wish to see you, I'm sorry. - [Man] Ugh, I'm not surprised, she's refused to see me from the start. - I'm the one who'll warm her up. - Enrico, if you think that one day your mother in law will wake up and decide to forgive you so that we can apply to the courts for a new trial, you are not being realistic. Madam Moretti will never forgive you. - And what should I do? - Wait, I'm afraid you may have to wait until she-- - No, she's liable to live forever. She's staying alive to make sure I remain in prison and the day she does deign to go to paradise, we'll have to begin all over from scratch with a petition to the bureaucracy, it'll take for years. - Don't despair Enrico. You were convicted wholly on circumstantial evidence. And they can't ignore that. If you are in jail today, it's largely due to your mother in law's testimony. - How I'd like to wring her neck. Avenge for all these years. At least then I'd have a valid reason for keeping me in prison. - Oh, you shouldn't think that way. You are not treated so badly in prison. You have many privileges that others have not. Inside, you are almost, well, you do as you want, and most of all, you have Nina. - Yeah, there's Nina. Ah, Sarah, you are everywhere. Very commendable, you run this place singlehanded. Ah, but I see your hands have suffered as well. - Eczema, when I work, I wear gloves for protection. - [Enrico] You have regular checkups, of course? - Of course I do. - Of course you do. Does my mother in law ever speak of me? - No. - And like everyone else, you're convinced she still hates me, for many old people, hate is a treasured companion Do you sleep with her? What do you think would happen if I went up and saw her? - I don't know. - What's to stop me going up now? - She's asleep, at night she lies awake. - Ah, then why don't you do me a favor? When you go on up to bed, leave the door open, as though you'd forgotten, oh, you don't have to say yes right away, by all means, think it over. You simply leave the door open. (sinister music) - I moved her to another room, Enrico. Sarah warned me. I pray to the last that you wouldn't try it. You gave me your promise. (engine revs) - He's gone, Miss Nina, he drove off in the car. When does he have to report? - Tomorrow morning. - This time, he won't go back. - Call a taxi. (urgent music) (man speaks foreign language) - Monsieur Somi. - Eh? - Somi, the consul, you know him very well and you know me too. - He's probably fast asleep by now. Room number two. (Nina knocks) (woman speaks foreign language) (Arabic music) - Even more squalid than usual. - You didn't complain about it being squalid when you came here. - I found it revolting. - But you always came. - I was too dumb to know it was a bordello. Does he owe for anything? - Nothing. - Get out. (Arabic music) (woman speaks foreign language) - You were afraid I wouldn't go back. - Yes. - I have never escaped because I'm not sure that you'd follow me. So I stay in jail. (Nina sighs) (melancholy music) - Hi Nina. - [Nina] Hello. - Ah, did you enjoy your outing? Boy, you're becoming even more of a mirage. Every time I call your house you're either out or you're sleeping. - Let's have a cup of coffee. Two coffees, please. You shouldn't have called me. - I just wanted to say hi, what's wrong with that? - It puts Enrico in a bad mood. I had to take the phone off the hook. - That's exactly what I wanted to talk to you about. Your father's a very strange character. - He's not my father. I was already born when my mother divorced to marry him. There is no need to tell you this, but I wanted to. Enrico is not my father, do you understand? - Wait a minute, you mean you-- - I promised him never to see you again. Don't make such a face, we have seen so little of each other We'll survive, Matthew? - Nina, listen. Do you understand how I feel about you? I mean, can you get it through your thick-- - No, I've told you everything, or almost. The rest you can guess. Let's forget the coffee, goodbye. (tinny music) (footsteps approach) (Nina moans) (Enrico pants) - Where? I get to go out of town for two days, more tourists. - Ah, yeah, the usual family? - A group. I pick them up tomorrow at nine at the hotel. - Why don't they stay home where they belong? - Because they know we need the money. - What are you doing? - Nothing. - Looking for my pills, eh? I never had any pills, I only said that to scare you. - If it's true, you succeeded. - What makes you think I'd hide them in here? There's a lot of other places, the refectory, the library, the laundry. And besides, you can do it so easily without them. There's an open window on the fourth floor of the infirmary and there's always a sheet. Tear it in strips and (hisses) - Enrico. - As if I would. (laughs) Oh, no, I don't have any more suspicions. I have decided to believe everything you tell me. Yes, I have complete faith in you. Now give me some money. - What for, Enrico? - You'll be gone two days. I wasn't wrong, you're becoming a miser, hmm? Come back soon. - I heard Nina say she won't be coming for a few days. - Yes, a group of tourists, that's what she told me, anyway. Tomorrow morning she's to meet them at the hotel. I would dearly like to know who they are and how many. - Your friend Hassan has two weeks. - Has he now. - We never tell them, not until sunrise on the day they're shot, that's why they sleep so little. Each morning could be their last. - Did she really tell you that? - Yes, that your tongue has the taste of honey. - Is she all right? - And very beautiful. - Did you try it with her? - Are you in love? - It wasn't funny. - I never said. (man yells foreign language) - Good morning. - Morning. - I'm the guide for Casbah tour, at nine o'clock I have to collect a group for that. - Yes, I'll tell them you're here. - Thank you. - Ah, monsieur. - Bonjour. - The young lady from Casbah Tours. - Merci, hi, Nina. - Oh look. - Now, look, this trip to Wazazad was planned by a bunch of friends of mine who couldn't make it, so now there's only me. - So what will your friends do? - (laughs) Oh, well, I have nothing against our going. - You and me? - Why not, it's paid for. (phone dial clicks) - Hello, Tanya, it's me, Nina. I'm here at the hotel, the group for the tour didn't show up There's only one, no, well, no, he wouldn't mind, but you know, I'd prefer to, okay, okay, bye. Listen, they say they don't give refunds. - I don't want the money. (laughs) - Matthew, I already told you why we can't see each other. - Yeah, okay, I can see the ruins in Wazazad another time. But at least give me a lift back to the camp. They left me here with no transportation. It's only an hour away, you can be back before noon. (engine starts) (Matthew sighs) - Come on, Nina, cheer up. - Tell me something. Who got you into this mess? Do your friends really exist? So you arranged everything, why? - Well, you know, when two people are attracted to each other... - What are you talking about? - Oh, come on, you know what I mean. - No, don't ever talk about what you feel for me, never. - Okay, okay, stay calm, take it easy, huh? Don't get yourself so riled up about it. - Shut up, please. - Okay. All right, so we don't have to see each other again, but do you think for one hour we could pretend to be friends and just talk? - About what? - Well, I don't know, whatever, the weather, Ike Benedu, you know, it's a pretty fantastic place, it's only 30 kilometers from Wazazad. - 15. (helicopter drones) - Okay, I want you to close your eyes. - Me? - Go on, I'll tell you when to open 'em. - Okay. Now? - No, not yet. (Nina laughs) Okay, you can look now, to your left, voila, the ruins of Ike Benedu. - [Nina] It's still beautiful. - You like it? - It's incredible, fabulous. - Ah. (speaks French) (travelers chatter) - You made it all up. - Hmm? - Trip, your non existent friends, you were so sure I'd come with you. - Yeah? (laughs) - I thought you were such a nice guy. - Oh, but I am, I even brought a picnic basket that I meant to cook at the camp, make you some chicken. - Are you crazy? - Probably. Now you go this way here. - Here, let me have this. - From Milano, he came to Morocco about 1920. And made a fortune by himself, then decided to settle here. He met my grandmother on his one and only trip to America and brought her back to Marrakesh. They just had a child, my mother. He was so jealous of both of them that he practically kept them locked up in the house. (Matthew laughs) After the family, his idol was Mussolini. - Yeah. - And because of his idea, he ended in a concentration camp. That gave my mother the chance to travel and finally to get married. - And then what? - Then she divorced my father to marry Enrico. He was at the Italian embassy then. I was very young, I just remember Enrico in my house. - And your father? - He's still in Morocco. I just see him at Christmastime and on my birthday. He's very angry with me. - Why? - Because of Enrico. Let's talk about something different. - Tell me something. - What? - Are you and Enrico... What's going on? (Nina sighs) - Enrico is the only man I ever knew. The way things are now, I've become his only reason for living, I can't leave him and I can't be unfaithful. - Nina, do you love him? - Sometimes I hate him. Come on, let's take a look at the ruins, that's why we're here. You know, I feel so good today, I almost wish I did not have to go back. - Well. You could stay longer. - How, though? - We could leave tomorrow. - Your dark and devious side is beginning to come out. (Matthew chuckles) - Come on, give yourself a break, huh? - Don't corrupt me. - Yeah? - Hmm. (Nina gasps) Hello, sir. - If you wish to visit the ruins, I'll be your guide. - No thanks, we've already seen them. - One moment, what do you say? You want to spend the night? - Matthew. - No, no, no, come on, I promise to keep my distance, all right, we'll get a room with two beds, we'll put a curtain in between of them. Or we can get separate bedrooms, I don't care. - You're impossible. - All right, all right, all right. (Matthew speaks foreign language) (both speak foreign language) - No. (Matthew growls playfully) - Come on. You want me to fill yours out for you? - No. I'm finished. - There you are, oh, pardon, there's a message for madame from Marrakesh. - It's Enrico, he knows I'm here with you alone. - How the hell did he find out? - I don't give a damn how he found out. He knows and that's that. - We'll explain to him, tell him it's my fault. - Sure, it's your fault. Why didn't you stay in your shit camp? Why did you bring me here? He's never going to believe I have nothing to do with this. He warned me, careful, he's just another one who wants to take you to bed, and here I am about to fall for the idea. - Nina, please, there's other people here. You know what, I don't think this is the time-- - Look, get this into your childish head. I love him and if you haven't already understood it, you're an idiot. - Stop it, Nina, I'm not gonna take any more of this shit, do you understand? - Who do you think you are? God, why did you have to come into my life? (Matthew speaks foreign language) - Two hours, Jesus, he's not in a hotel with a private phone, he said if I ever saw you again, he'd kill himself, and he keeps his promises, not like me. - That's enough about him. You wanna go, okay, we'll go right now. Come on. (dramatic music) (Nina knocks) - I have to speak to Omar, please, it's very urgent. (man speaks foreign language) I want to speak to Omar, chief Omar. - It's too late for that, he's not on duty now. - Try, please, it's important. - It's not possible. - He'll understand, please try. (man speaks foreign language) (dramatic music) - Hello, Nina, it's always a pleasure. - I raise 200. - I see you. - Two queens. - Three fours. (men laugh) - Ciao. - It's a pleasure. - Mmm, this bottle is empty, Nina, get me another one. Don't bother, we are nearly finished. Besides, she's not tired, right, Nina? (Arabic music) Give me more credit, make it 100. - [Man] That is a third, you are beginning to run out of money. - No, wait. (man laughs) (man speaks foreign language) - Chips, each one 100, huh? One. (Arabic music) Ah, this one's empty too. (bottle shatters) I'm putting all my bills in the kitty. Eh, who cares if I win or lose? I play for pleasure, not money. - Ugh, I have to go. - Hmm, what's wrong? - I cannot play with guilt. - Oh, no, no, no, take it all, take it, come on, Omar, here, take it. You should take it. It's late, time to hit the sack. Omar, show me another way out. You, I'd like to see you dead and buried. (Nina gasps) (phone rings) - Jesus. (sighs) Hello? Eh, who is this? (man speaks foreign language) No, Nina's not here, what the hell are you-- - Listen to me, he thinks she'll try suicide. She's not home and I can't find her anywhere. - Oh, no, man. (man speaks foreign language) - Monsieur Somi asked me to call you. - Oho, well, he's okay then and Nina thought he committed suicide, eh? Now he's worried about her, you know, I've had it. These two have broken my balls. - I don't understand, I was only asking your help. I'll go out and find her myself. Wait, wait. (men speak in foreign language) - What? Oh, yeah. - Are you English? - No, American. - Have you run around? - No, not really. - Well, come in. - Thank you. - I'm afraid you put yourself out for nothing. Nina only comes to see me at Christmastime. In case of daughter, I'm a father, discredited, removed, put aside. - The real one. (man laughs) - I think there is proof to the contrary. - Oh. - Now would you be kind enough to offer some explanation for this visit? - Yeah, well, when Nina disappeared, she had a bottle of sleeping pills with her and she was very depressed. - Oh. And... You think she may have committed suicide. - I don't know. - I see, well. Whether she has or not, try to help her. - How? - Take her away, away from this town, this country, away from Enrico Somi. (men speak foreign language) (man knocks) - Matthew. (speaks foreign language) - Is Nina here? - No, she always goes home on weekends. - Her father called, she wasn't there. - Well, I'm sorry, I don't know anything. - She must have some other friends. - Sure. - Do you have their numbers? - Yes, but I keep my book in the agency. I don't have a phone here. - Come on, let's go. - All right, but later, right now I'm busy. - Please, I'm very worried about her. (both speak foreign language) (woman gasps) - Matthew! - Oh God. Nina? Nina? (both speak foreign language) Nina, Nina? - She can't hear you, she's sleeping. Best not to wake her. (Matthew sighs) - Come on, let's get the hell out of here. (man speaks foreign language) - I telephone and talk to Enrico, he wants to speak to you. (somber music) - When? - Right now. - Okay. (somber music) (footsteps approach) - Now Nina will thinks she owes you her life. - No, oh, no, you pushed her into suicide and you're the one who saved her by giving the alarm. Even here, you manage to do what you want. You watch her, interfere, punish her. You manipulate her better here than you would on the outside - Since you arrived, she's been avoiding me. - Oh, I wish that were true, but... But Nina didn't plan the trip to Wadzaza. I did. - However, you took her there just the same. You spent hours together, talking, laughing. - Come on, isn't it enough she came back to you? - After 1000 years have passed, your day together still exists. I'll make her pay for it. - You sick bastard. You saved her so you could punish her, didn't you, eh? - I saved her because she's mine and no one can take her away from me, not even Nina herself. - Did you ever consider you're ruining any chance she'd have for a decent, normal life? - What is normal for her is me ever since she was 13 years old, did you know that? - Yeah, well, that's gonna change because she's getting out of this and I'm gonna help her. Oh, by the way, you know that she told me sometimes she hates your guts? - Naturally, I hate her too sometimes, like right now. It happens, you know, between two people who love each other Did she say anything else? - No, she has no desire to talk about it, not about you or how her mother died. - I'll tell you about it. On a certain night, Sarah, the servant accompanied my wife to a room where Nina and I were not expecting her. She could have reported me, her daughter was a minor. Divorced me, shot me, anything, instead. (laughs) She killed herself to punish me, but before the bitch, she had written a letter to her mother, Signora Moretti, saying that if something should happen to her, I alone would have been responsible. She wanted to separate me from Nina. I'm in jail, but I have still got Nina and if you'd like to know, it would be worse for me if I were free and not have Nina. - Jesus, don't you care about her welfare? - Yes, very much. Now, listen to me, boy. Forget her. Keep out of it. - I'm told it's very difficult to establish just what blood absorbs during an intravenous wash. Maybe it wasn't poison. Could have been a sedative in the form of a massive dose. - Naturally. - Anyway. At least it was a painless death. Poor old Barbara. She just went off to sleep and never woke up. - Anyway, it was enough to put Somi away. - Signora Moretti took care of that. Go. She was in Italy when Barbara died. She came flying back like an avenging angel, carrying the famous letter which you know about. She had the body exhumed, demanded another autopsy, used her influential friends, she even took a firm of international lawyers. She stopped at nothing until she got Enrico convicted. After that, she shut herself up in Barbara's bedroom. And has never come out. - Tell me about your wife. - Mmm. She was beautiful. More beautiful than Nina. Very elegant, exquisite manners and not very lucky. Twice in her life she opened a door she should never have opened, the first time, she found me. With someone I shouldn't have been with. The second time, Nina and Enrico. I happened to run into her not long before she died and... She said to me, I'm curious to know what I will find behind the third door. - Sounds to me like she was thinking of suicide. - Hmm, or else that was going to be killed. - Enrico says she committed suicide. (man chuckles) - He says many things. - Eh. - When my wife died, Enrico was not alone in the house. Sarah was there too. Barbara had always promised to leave her money in the event of her death, a lot. Have you met Sarah? - No, but I saw her once. - She always wears gloves, eczema, she says. Others suggest leprosy. Sarah lives in terror of being sent off to a leper colony, but with Barbara's money, eczema will never become leprosy. (laughs) - She get the money? - No. Barbara never made a will. Nina was also in the house at the time. - But she was only a child then. - Who hated her mother, her rival. She'd only been going to bed with Enrico for some time. Does that sound like a child to you, huh? - Now what are you trying to make me believe? - Nothing, my daughter was born after Barbara and Enrico began their relationship, not that in the meantime I stopped mine, of course, but. Does this disturb you? These things happen in the best of families. If you want to get rid of your doubts, go and talk with Signora Moretti. She was her daughter's only confidante. - You ever try asking her? - Oh yes, of course. She burst out laughing. (laughs) Maybe even Barbara didn't know. She lied to me. (men laugh) (man shouts in foreign language) - Hassan? - Suicide. (Matthew knocks) - What did you come here for? - I wanted to see how you were. I went to the hospital, you left. - I'm fine, it seems that I have you to thank. - Enrico gave the alarm. - I will have to thank him too. - I met Mr. Bouty. - So you know my father. You are getting to know the whole family. What do you want? - Nothing, just to see if there was anything you wanted. - Get out. And what did Mr. Bouty have to say? - A lot of things, the one thing he did say was to get you out of Morocco. - Would you do it? - Of course. - I can't. - Ah. Enrico, huh? It's always Enrico. How many more years of your life are you gonna throw away on him? - As many as he has to stay in prison. - What is this, a debt of gratitude? - No, complicity. - Nina... Whatever you did then, you were only a child. - Doesn't change anything. - Yes it does, 14 or 15 years old, you're not legally responsible for anything. - Did Monty tell you about my mother, how she died? - I don't give a damn how she died, let's get the hell out of here right now. - You think it was me. Look, the medicine that killed my mother, I never even saw it. You look relieved, very relieved. Anyway, when my mother opened the door, she found both of us in bed, Enrico and me. It's as if I held her still when Enrico put the drug into the intravenous bottle. So we both are involved, come back in 10 years, when Enrico is released. - 10 years, you'll only be a memory. - I know, you were wrong to come to the agency the other day, you should have let me sleep. Go away please. - No. You know what Mr. Bouty told me? That Enrico might be your father. - No. It's not true. - Now your grandmother could tell you, she knows. You ever tried asking her or are you afraid of the truth? - Your dark side, Matthew. - Now you go on up there and you find out, you don't want to hear it, do you, huh? You don't want to hear it? Oh yeah, Nina, run away, that's right, run away. (engine revs) You want to push her to kill herself again? It is not I who is pushing her. It's Enrico. It's you! With your suspicion. With your revelations. You are destroying their lives. A messed up life. You think you will convince Nina to follow you. You will never succeed. Maybe I should like to talk to Mrs. Lorette! Go away from here or else I call the police. Call the police. I would also like to report a leprosy case. I will go talk to Mrs Lorette and we will see about the ghost. (somber music) - Looking for Nina, she's not here. - Where did she go? - Prison, I guess, probably to apologize to you for her suicide attempt. - Sarah, Sarah. - Oh, she's hiding around here somewhere eavesdropping. What are you doing here, another parole? - I took it. - Oh, you mean you escaped, you know, they're gonna lock you up and throw away the key. - Rosetti picked me up. - You better turn yourself in as quick as possible. - Listen to me, pretty boy, my job is this, this is my house too, so get the hell out of here now. - What's the matter, you nervous? - I'm tired of seeing you around. - For Christ's sake, you come with me, I got a surprise for you. Come on, why is everybody in this house so goddamn evasive? After you. (eerie music) - [Moretti] Enrico? Enrico, thank God, I've prayed and prayed that I'd see you just once again before I died. Oh, you've come back to see me, Enrico. You're a good boy. Was it Nina who persuaded you? - Nina. - Yes, she always told me one day you'd come back. I thought she said it just to cheer me up, but in my heart, I've always been expecting you, Enrico, I had faith in you and in our Lord. - I don't understand, I didn't know. - Oh, of course, of course, a very painful affair for all of us, you were right to go away. I wouldn't have blamed you if you'd never come back to this country or this house ever ever again. But now that you're here, it makes me so happy. - I thank you. - No, it's I who should thank you. Did you get my letters? Oh, you don't have to answer that. Nina told me she wasn't certain of your address in Europe. I always thought it was a merciful lie. I thought you still held a grudge. With the trial, sentence, oh. But now that you're here, it doesn't matter that you never answered. - What did you write? - Oh, many things, some facts, and... A request. - What? - You see, when Barbara died, I was deranged. I thought I was the hand of God's justice. I was blinded by sorrow for a long time. But then I suddenly realized it was the devil taking advantage of my desperation by keeping me ignorant and wicked, oh. It took me many years, tears and prayers to understand. But then one day, the Lord enlightened me. He sent me Barbara in a dream. She was crying, asking forgiveness, she said she'd committed mortal sin, the most serious one of all. You see, I'd always believed everything Barbara told me, that you wanted to kill her, that Nina could be your daughter. Now I know she lied to me, Barbara killed herself and there's no remission for that sin. But years ago when I wrote that letter, they would have granted you your pardon, I-- - My pardon? Did you sign the request for my pardon? - Oh, why yes, Enrico, but then you went away. You see, I thought if you could forgive Barbara, the Lord would be compassionate with my daughter. This is what I've been waiting for, to ask you if you've forgiven her, and if you haven't, I beg you, do it now. - Yes, I forgive her. - Oh, Enrico, how right I was not to die. Oh, we must tell Nina, where is she, why isn't she here? Haven't you seen her? - No. - Oh, she'll be so happy, she never wanted to leave me, you know, she and Sarah, the three of us here alone. Remembering Barbara, and waiting for you. Come, come. (eerie music) (woman speaks foreign language) - Nina? - Yes, Nina. - What did you tell her? You have destroyed everyone's life. Including yours. Now you can no longer have the stage. You have lost Nina. Both of them. Huh? Where is she? Where is she? Let me go! Come on, tell me where Nina is. Tell me! She is gone. She took a plane. The first plane. - Whatever you did, Enrico deserved it. - Don't touch me. - I know you hate me at this moment, but you're finally getting away from him and the rest of those people. Try and live without them, I know you can do it if you get away from here. If you have any problems, call me. I'll be waiting. I'll come to you, wherever you are. Okay? (dramatic music) - What are you doing here? - Matthew, Enrico's in Rome. - Aw Jesus. - He called me, when I went to your office, he followed me. - What did he say to you? - He wants to see me alone, I hung up. - Good, well, look, don't worry about this. If he shows up here, I'll talk to him. - No, we mustn't see him. - Well, what do we do? - Run away. - Just like that? - Yeah. - Nina, I don't think that's the solution. Even if we left Rome, he'd find us sooner or later, you know that, don't you? Oh, come on, come on, don't worry. - May I help you? - Hello, I'd like to see Mr. Matthew Jackson. - May I have your name, please? - Enrico Somi. - Is he expecting you? - I think so. - Mr. Jackson, Mr. Somi to see you. - Okay, let him through. - Enrico? - Yeah. - I told you I don't want to see him. - We better talk to him. - No, send him away. - Look, he'd only come back and I think we'd better end this now, okay? Here he comes. I know you don't want to do this, but we have to, okay, for us, all right? (eerie music) - Well, here we are, Matthew. You look frightened, Nina. - What do you want? - I was passing through Rome and I thought it would be nice to say hello to Nina, did I do wrong? - You might have warned me before you came. - When I did telephone, you didn't give me a chance. All morning I've been running after you just to say ciao, no hard feelings. - With those dark glasses, you seem so-- - Well, you know, the last time I was back here, it was 20 years ago, and the feel of it, it's a loss. - Okay, I've heard enough, why don't you just get the hell out of her lives, all right? - Don't be in such a hurry, now, your grandmother's dead, the property in Morocco becomes yours, do you intend to keep it? - What do you get in it? (both speak foreign language) - I don't understand a damn thing you're saying, could you speak English? - He wants my grandmother's house. - Well, let him have it, we don't want it. - Why don't you let Nina speak? - You're right, you want Casa Moretti, it's yours. - No, no, no, I don't want a present to repay me for, I prefer to stay a creditor. - Listen, Enrico, if you came to present a bill for those years in prison, it's useless, I can't give them back to you. (Enrico speaks foreign language) - What is he talking about? - He thinks I should feel guilty. - You son of a bitch. - I am talking to Nina, not you. - An apology. That's what you want? - Guilt festers. - It was I who decided your fate, at the time it was what I wanted. - All those years in prison, Nina. (Nina speaks foreign language) - I think I'm going crazy, what is he talking about? - No, I felt no shame. Every day I came to see you, it's as if we were living together and you weren't in prison. My visits were all you had, nobody else, just me. - You have no hint of remorse, eh? - Peace, Enrico, peace is what I felt, not remorse. I had what I wanted. - You heard her? It wasn't for revenge, it wasn't even meant as a punishment, now you know what you married. - I'm beginning to lose my patience. You can get the hell out of here now. - Very well, Nina, I'll take your house. I look forward to living there. Will you come with me? - No. (somber music) - I'll wait by the car. - What's going on here? - It's not important. I'm sorry, Matthew, I did my best. - Wait a minute, you're going with him? - There is nothing I can do about it. - Well, I won't let you. - I would escape. - Nina, I love you. I love you more than he does. - I know. - Well, I don't understand. - He's old now, didn't you notice? I won't even have to keep him imprisoned, he's mine. (eerie music)
