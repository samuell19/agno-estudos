- [Emcee] Ladies and gentlemen, receiving his fourth decoration for meritorious service, Lieutenant Ray Harlan. (audience applauding) - [Dispatcher] All units in the vicinity of central Manhattan bus terminal respond to a possible hostage situation. Shots have been fired. (gunshots banging) - [Ray] No! - [Mom] Oh god, my boy! - [Doctor] It's the opinion of this doctor that due to his involvements in recent events culminating in the death of an 11-year-old boy, it would be best if Lieutenant Harlan be relieved of duty until... - [Vlad] My people and I make millions each year while you scrape by on the cop's salary. Justice, hm. - [Lou] Ray, will you come home? There are other cops in New York. You don't have to be there. You need some family. Besides, I need you now. - [Darcy] Ray Harlan, ladies and gentlemen, whose accomplishments include four service awards, three years with the NYPD, and one very distinguished honor, jumping the bones of Mary-Jo Bronkowski. - How you doing, brother? Hey, that was cute. - [Darcy] Yeah, I thought you'd enjoy that. Now get in, man, we're in a hurry. - Lookin' good. (upbeat electronic music) (siren blaring) What's with the cherry? - Well, the Black Rose Boys are up to some mischief. - Black Rose, huh? - Russians. I thought you should hit the ground running. (gunshots banging) So they tell me the crime rate in the Big Apple has dropped. - Yeah, action's getting a little stale. I'm glad to be out of there. - I can tell the boys here are gonna love you coming back. - I can always ride with you, little brother. - Just remember, that's ride with me, not on me. (gunshots banging) - Gimme a break. If it wasn't for me, you'd probably be rotting away in some cell with a bunkmate who calls you Sally. - I miss those lectures. That's beautiful. - You know, by the way, those cigarettes, they kill more people than car accidents, drugs, alcohol, and bullets combined. - You quit again, huh? How long's it been? - Three days. - Three days. (laughs) (gunshots banging) (gunshots banging) Let's go. - Put that away. - Oh, you've got that look in your eye. (gunshots banging) (gunshots banging) (tires screeching) - What the? (fence clattering) (gunshots banging) (gunshots banging) - We can't stay here. - What are you doing? - Let's go inside, inside. Split up. - Of course. - Cowboy Ray Harlan, I should've known it was you. - How you doin', Frenchy? Good to see you. - What's going on in there, huh? - They knocked off a high-stake poker game. - Frenchy, the door. Clear! Just like hold times, eh? - And as usual I'm still watching your back, little brother. Nice homecoming. (gunshots banging) Go.

Oh my god. (dramatic music) - [Dispatcher] 911. - I think there's an intruder in my apartment. - [Dispatcher] One moment. Megan Stewart, 2 Bolton Street, Apartment 3. Mam, the police have been dispatched. Stay where you are until the officers arrive and keep the line open. - Hey, Frenchy, catch. Heads or tails? - Tails! Hey, listen, Yankee and Doodle, dispatch got a call. Intruder. - What are you doing? - 2 Bolton, number 3. The building behind you. - What'd he say? - Come on, move! - Where are you going? - Get this guy down, now! Let's move! - Hey, what are you doing? Freaks! You can't...

(Megan gasps) - Drop the weapon. - Do not test me, I will kill her. - You kill her, I kill you. - Hey! - Shut up! - Drop the weapon and maybe your lawyer will have you out on the street by morning. Now drop it. - Yeah, don't do this, don't. - All right. - Easy. (gunshots banging) (Ivan groaning) - What kind of stupid, macho, Neanderthal move was that? - You're welcome. - Who the hell do you think you are? You could've killed me. - Ain't life a bowl of cherries. (Frenchy and Darcy laughing) - Ouch. - I work for the police department, I've got friends. I want your badge number because I'm gonna report you! - What the hell happened here? - That moron blew up my toilet. - Well, that's a hell of a first day, brother, considering you haven't punched in yet. - [Ivan] Be careful! - Wait till you get to your cell. Cuff him. - [Darcy] Come on, scumbag. - We got right to make phone call. - Don't tell me about your rights, you moron. - Can I have some service over here? Go on. Gonna miss you guys. Go in. - Lou. - Goddamn, it's good to see you! It's hard to believe you've only been here a few hours. The whole station is buzzing. Your reputation as a hard-ass precedes you. (upbeat rock music) - [Vlad] The reports I am getting are not favorable, Mikael. - [Mikael] Yes, Uncle. - [Vlad] You waste my time and my money. - Uncle, they are lies. We've had a few setbacks, but nothing unusual. I need more money for bribery, to compete. In this respect, the competition is well ahead of us. - [Vlad] No, there will be no more investment until I see results. This opportunity you are squandering will not last forever. And Mikael. - Yes, Uncle Vladimir? - [Vlad] I have just learned that my old friend Lieutenant Ray Harlan has arrived in your back yard. - [Mikael] Should this concern me? - [Vlad] Very much so. He has been a big problem for me here in New York. Do not underestimate him, he doesn't play by the rules. - Neither do we. Do not worry, I will take care of it. - [Vlad] Do not let me down, Mikael. Even if you are my blood, you will die. - Now, Ray, you know better than most how Russians love payola. You talk to me, huh, and anyone I say is okay. We'll put you on the clock starting tomorrow. Okay then. Darcy, get him out of here. Oh, hey, tonight you and Darceú are coming for dinner. - Oh, oh. - What? What are you looking so warm and fuzzy for? - Thanks for bringing me back. New York was getting a little shaky, you know, empty. You two guys are the only family I got, you know. It's good to be home, Lou. - Go, will ya? I'm about to shed a tear. - Thanks. (light jazzy music) - It's great having you boys here. I miss all the great dinners we used to have. - Great, I don't know about that. - Hey, wise guy, I make a great stew. - Brace yourself, Ray, here comes the stew speech. - Stew's a real healthy meal. Did you know that poor people don't get sick like the rich because they eat a lot of stews? Yeah, it's cheap to make, and it has all the necessary vitamins. Now eat, you ungrateful delinquents. (Ray and Darcy laughing) - I'm sorry, Lou, it must have been tough for you, huh? Raising a couple of tough heads like us. - Ah, it wasn't so bad. As a matter of fact, most of the time we had a ball, right? You boys, you turned out just fine. I love you both very much.

I mean, she was so pissed off at you that she wanted me to have you busted down to traffic cop. Anyhow, after I calmed her down, I found out that she worked at Central Database uptown at 21st Division. - [Ray] She works for the department? - Yeah, yeah, I offered her a raise and invited her to join our precinct.

Meet me there in 10. - Spruce and Goose. Spruce and Goose. (officers chattering) (siren blaring) Hey, Blue, Frenchy. - [Frenchy] Hello, Ray. - Take your best shot? - Nice church, how many? - [Darcy] Only four, but they got the caretakers hostage. I think they might be going for the padre as well. - I don't mind taking out a gas station, but a church? - Listen, anything or anybody comes out those doors, shoot 'em. Let's go, little brother.

Would you like to pray? I'll let you pray to me. (laughs) - Look what I found. - Excellent, Father, come here. I have something I want to confess. - You mustn't do this, it is an offense against God. - We are your new congregation, Father. However, I must warn you, we are pretty much atheists.

I think you might want to take it easy for a little while. Internal Affairs is already sniffing around. - I don't think you should get involved, Lou. - You know, when I asked you to leave New York and come and work with me, and you said you were glad to, I did everything I could to make it happen. Well, I called in favors I didn't even know I had. And now I owe favors. The point that I'm making is. - Thanks. - You're like my own flesh and blood. There isn't anything in the world I wouldn't do for you. But there's still a job to be done, hm? I'll deal with Internal Affairs. You take care of Mick and his boys. And honestly I don't care if they leave on a bus or in a body bag, I just want 'em wiped out. - You know, Lou, I haven't seen anything on these guys yet. I mean, what do we really know about them besides the fact that Mikael and Vladimir are related? Nothing. - Yeah, it is a little disorganized around here, isn't it? Let's go to the computer room. I think it's time you and Megan got reacquainted. - I don't think she likes me too much, Lou. - Use your boyish charm, come on. - Please, come on. - Megan, you remember Lieutenant Harlan. - Not by choice. - Well, good to see you again, too, Miss Stewart. - Megan, I know this isn't your job description, but I'm in a time crunch. I want you to work with Ray.

Hey, you don't know me well enough to dislike me. - I know all about you. Did you know that the FBI and the NSA have files on you? - Oh really, I had no idea. - I know that you received four decorations for meritorious service. - Well, see, I guess I'm not so bad then. - I also know you were the biggest disturber in the history of your precinct. I know that you were on sick leave for six months, then had to go through a psych evaluation because of your unorthodox behavior that almost cost you your shield. - That's privileged information, could get you arrested. - I'm covered. - I'll bet you are. - Look, the point is, Lieutenant, don't brush me aside. I'm not some chick, I'm an asset to this force. - Hey, files don't tell you everything, Miss Stewart. They have a tendency to leave out the person. - Oh, fill in the blanks for me. - Well, maybe one day when you cut me some slack, I will. - You're so full of it. The captain stole that sword from some sushi bar in San Francisco, everybody knows that. - You know, this was given to Lou by a family of sword masters on the island of Shiku-- - Shokoko. - Shokoko, it doesn't matter. Anyway, it's not about that. It's about the steel and the force of spirit behind that steel, which you wouldn't understand. - We've listened to lot of your stories, but there's no way that you can expect me to believe that the lieutenant here can cut through steel with that sword. - This is Japanese samurai, strongest steel known to man. Wrapped over 200 times. Ray. - You got money that says this can't be done? - 100 bucks. - Whoa. 100 bucks, man, put that money up here. - He's a rich boy. - You hear that? 100 bucks.

Because you never know when a spare might come in handy. Well, me and Darcy, we went to get a little bite to eat. - And? - And he seems to think that you're nuts about me, only your hostility is just a way to hide the way you really feel about me. - Hm, what I think he probably said was that I think you're nuts. - Oh. So you gonna invite me in, have a little cup of coffee? Maybe use your toilet. (laughs) - Well, I'm gonna have to suggest you put it down first. It's late, I'll see you tomorrow.

Tell him Mikael says an eye for an eye, a hand for a hand. - How is he? - He shot him in the hand. He's all messed up. - He'll bounce back, he's strong. Did he say why they targeted him? - Because Mikael Pushkin, he had a message for me, and he sent it through Darcy. This is bull. I think I'll send a little message of my own. - Be careful, don't do anything stupid, Ray. We'll get this Pushkin punk, Darce, I promise you.

I guess you've been talking to your Uncle Vladimir, huh? - He says you've caused him a lot of grief. - Not as much as I'm gonna cause you. - We are growing more powerful every day. America, what a country, yes? And with us controlling it, we'll make it greater. - Oh, so you think you can just waltz in here and take over, huh? - Not alone.

Why the hell should I believe you? - It doesn't matter to me what you think. - Look, I'm gonna quit dicking around with you and get right to the point. I want the ass who beat and shot my brother, and then maybe I'll let you live a little longer. - And I want the ass who beat and shot Boris. My uncle wants you dead. I want you dead. Do you see any reason why I don't do it right now? - Ethics? How's your prickly little ass? - How's your brother's face? - Ray, listen to me. I got my revenge with your brother. I'm satisfied with that for now. But the next time we meet, I will kill you. - You're a dead man. (men laughing) - I heard about Darcy, sorry. - Me too. - How is he? - A little shaky. They said they're gonna release him from the hospital tomorrow. So you hungry, you want to get a little bite to eat? - Girl's gotta eat. Come on, I know a good spot. - So what's your story? - Well, I grew up in Vermont. My dad got transferred here. I went to college, I got interested in computers, started working for the police department. I'm single, so end of story. You got a girl? - Nope. Mm, these are great, huh? - So Lou said he raised you and Darcy. - Mhm, my mom died about six months after Dad passed away. - How did she die? - I guess a broken heart. - That must've been really hard. - Well, abandonment is always tough. - I guess Lou had to pull a lot of strings to get you here. - Yeah, well you know Lou. I'm glad he did. I mean, Lou and Darcy, only family I've got. - Lou seems to have a really protective demeanor. - He's got a good reason to. I mean, him and my dad, they were like this. They were closer than brothers. And he saw my father die along with a lot of other guys. And then he came home to what? Not exactly a hero's welcome after Vietnam. And how he's a cop, a damn good one too. Another thankless job. - I don't why anybody would ever want to be a cop. I mean, it certainly isn't the money. What is it? - Free parking. (laughs) So any information on Pushkin yet? - No, no, but hopefully soon. Oh, and Ray. - You know, it's been a long time since I picked up one of you boys from the hospital. - Hey, nice, Lou. Last time I was driving in the car with you, I think you had tape on your ripped seats and it smelled like cat piss. - Come a long way since then. Things have changed, for Darcy too. Our investments have paid off, haven't they, Darce? Hey, slugger, we gotta talk about your future. You know, getting you on board with us. We're family, right? Got to stick together. - I don't have any money, Lou. I mean, I spend it faster than I make it. - Did you hear me ask this guy for a loan? I'm talking about making money. - Paid Mikael Pushkin a visit. - You what? You're one crazy son of a bitch, you know that? I'm surprised you didn't get killed. What happened? - He went on about how great and powerful his people are. - Hey, the only thing they're good at is drinking vodka. What else? - Some bull about how some of the city's police department is corrupt. - Those Ruskie bastards, they think everybody's corrupt. - Yeah, well I asked him for some names. He couldn't give me any, so I told him he's full of it. - And then what happened? - He said one thing or another, I said one thing or another. And then he threatened to kill me next time he sees me. - Jesus, Ray, come on, take it easy will you? Be careful. I can use a drink. Why don't we go to our place and have a few, huh?

He's got $1.3 million in a Cayman account. - I don't believe this. - Lou and Frenchy have about the same. - What? What? What? What about Darcy? Well, goddamn it all. Goddamn it all. That does not mean that Lou had anything to do with Darcy's death though. Pushkin has got to have something to do with this. Hey, Joe, it's Ray. - [Joe] Yes, sir? - Listen, I want you to bring Mikael Pushkin to the interrogation room right now. - [Joe] Blue and Frenchy just picked him up. - What? - [Joe] Yeah, Captain's orders. - When? - 15 minutes ago. - Thanks, Joe. - Sure. - [Megan] What is it? - Blue and Frenchy just picked up Pushkin, and Lou ordered the release. (blow cracking) (man groaning) - Hello, Ray, look what I got. - What are you doing, Lou? - What you should've done when you had him. You're not getting soft on me, are you, Ray? - He didn't kill Darcy. - No? Then who did? - Ray, please help me. Please, I know. (gunshot banging) (Mikael shouts) - That's for Darcy, you Ruskie son of a bitch. - What did he know, Lou? - Nothing. What's there to know? - I know about your Cayman bank account. I know about yours too. And yours. - Well, that's very interesting. How did you come by this information? Of course, Megan Stewart. Who else have you shared this information with? - Nobody yet. I want to know who killed my brother. Was it you? - I could never do that. He had no choice. - No choice, huh? No choice? And you stood by and you just let it happen. - I didn't know anything about it. It's out of my hands. This is way bigger than you, me, or Darcy. Ray, I'm just a pawn in the king's court. You wouldn't believe the power of the people involved here. - A pawn, you mean like me? You called me in here to take care of Mikael because he was cuttin' in on your business. And that's the only reason, isn't it? - No, I wanted you to come in with us. You, me, and Darcy, we would've been great together. - You know, I might've done it, Lou. I might've done it, but now the sight of you makes me sick. I thought you were our father. I was wrong because a father would never, ever let anybody do that to his son. - We had no choice, Ray. He was getting weak. He wanted out. People above thought he was talking too much. - You always have a choice, Frenchy, and apparently you guys have made yours. Now I'm gonna make mine. - Ray, I'm begging you, join us. It's not too late. - Oh, come on, Lou. Oh, it's way too late for that. Jesus Christ. What are you gonna do, Lou? You gonna kill me too, Father? (gunshots banging) (glass shattering) (gunshots banging) (dramatic music) (horn honking) - [Frenchy] Should we make a call? - No, this is personal. He'll be back. I know him well. - Megan! God, are you all right? - Ray, what the hell is going on? Where have you been? I've been leaving messages all over town. - Just listen to to me, listen to me. - What happened? - I gotta get you out of here. - What's going on? - Look, I can't explain it to you right now, okay? - Where are we going? - I don't know, a motel maybe. - A motel? - I don't even know who I can trust. But you got to trust me, okay? Please, please, come on. Come on, come on, come on, come on. - Why don't you take a shower and grab a couple hours' sleep? I think you could use it. - Yeah. (somber music) Oh Jesus. Never, ever let anybody do that to his son. - [Darcy] Just a little investment for the future. You know, can't be cops forever, right? - [Megan] There were rumors about crooked cops, so I ran a random check on the computer. - [Mikael] Check your own department, Ray. That's where the answer is. - [Megan] I found something on Lou. - [Lou] Things have changed. - [Megan] He's got $1.3 million in a Cayman account. - [Lou] Our investments have paid off, haven't they, Darce? - [Megan] Lou and Frenchy have about the same. - [Frenchy] People above thought he was talking too much. - [Darcy] You know I love Lou, right? This partnership with him is killing me. - [Ray] Are you gonna kill me too, Father? - What are you doing? - I'm going. - Where are you going, Ray? - What are you doing? - I'm not sitting around here while you get yourself killed. I'm going back to the police station to back up the files so nobody erases them. - Hey, that's a really good idea, but I don't want you doing it. Now come on, this is very personal to me right now. This is between me and Lou. I don't want you involved. - I'm already involved, Ray. They want me dead too. Besides, I'll be at the police station where I can be safer. - Know how to use one of these? - Yeah. - The safety's on, take it. - [Frenchy] I can't believe you came back, Ray. I thought you were smarter than that. You may not be in New York, but you're way out of your league, mon ami. Welcome home. - You're gonna wish I never came back, Frenchy. When you shot my brother, you killed yourself. (gunshots banging) (gunshots banging) (gunshot banging) (Blue shouting) (gunshots banging) (gunshots banging) (gunshots banging) (gunshot banging) (siren blaring) - I'm standing behind you, Ray. Drop your guns. It's all been said before. There's nothing more to say. - Wrong. Drop the guns or I drop you. Now! One. Two. Three. (gunshot banging) (kick thudding) (Frenchy groans) - Run! (gunshots banging) Geez. Gimme the gun. Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah, are you? - What are you doing here? - You're welcome. - I can't believe you shot him. - I said I would. - That you did. (gunshots banging) We can't stay here too long. Oh geez. - What are you doing? What are you doing? - There's some gas in there. I hope there's enough. Hey, take my tourniquet off. - What? Oh god. - Just take it off. - Oh god, oh god, there. Careful. (gunshots banging) (gunshots banging) - Oh, damn it, I shouldn't have quit smoking. - Here, here, here. - You smoke? - Gimme that. - Damn it. Try to get it there. - [Megan] There, I got it. That's it, it's going. - Okay, now run like heck, go. (gunshots banging) (dramatic music) - Oh my god. (explosion booming) (Frenchy shouting) - Megan? - I remember teaching you how to use that. Hurts like hell, but I'm still alive. - You all right? - It's the final scene, huh, Ray? Father against son. - No, Lou, no. Father against himself. Megan and I are walking out of here. - I don't think so. - Trust me, he won't shoot you. - Don't move. Ray, don't test me. Ray. Ray! Ray! Ray! Ray! I'm sorry. Darcy! Darcy. (dramatic music) (triumphant music)
