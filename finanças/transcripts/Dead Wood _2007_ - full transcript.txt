Rob? Rob. Rob. Rob. Rob. Oh, hi. Hi. Sorry I'm late. You've got a lot of stuff. Oh, it's just the tent mostly. I wasn't sure what I needed to bring. Just a sleeping bag and a towel, really. Do you do this a lot? No, I've only used the tent twice... ...for Glastonbury. Oh, good. Glad I'm not the only novice. I'm not too good with this whole... ...communing-with-nature thing. You guys ready for an adventure? Sort of. This is gonna be so much fun. All right, Webb? All right, mate? How's it going? Yeah, not bad, not bad. Hi, Webb. Nice to meet you. - Good to meet you too, Jess. - Cool van. Thanks. She's my baby. Hey, I thought I was your baby. No, you're my best girl. Come here. Everyone comfortable? Hi, and welcome to 'The Dave Peacock Show'. Baby, look at me. Look at me. - Smile. - It's another beautiful day tomorrow... ...and Dave just walked into the studio in his Bermuda shorts. Guys, sit next to each other... ...just a bit closer, a bit closer. Don't be shy. Aww, you two make such a nice couple. Put your arm around her. Come on. Now say cheese. We'll have to hike pretty fast if we want to get to the lake by dark. How far is it? Not far. But you don't want to be walking through the woods at night. - Better? - Much. Oi! Oh, right. I've had it. Right, come on, man. Can't you get me? Dick. Don't be so childish. What's the matter? Are you gonna start crying? - Oh my... Right. - Crybaby crybaby. Good for you. You're crying. For fuck's sake, Milk, you want to stop that? It's Lar... Can you not see it's Larri? Careful. Webb's driving. It's all right. You don't have to show off in front of Jess. You want to drive? What did you hit? Jess. Poor thing. Should we take it to a vet? It won't make it. What? You're not gonna kill it, are you? Webb, you can't. It's in pain. It's the best thing. Come on, everybody out. We're here. Finally. Jess, look. Over there. - It's a weasel. Squirrels are up there. - Lovely. Come on. How did they get all the way out here. Must be a road nearby. No. The only road's the one we came in on. You can't drive through the woods... ...not this deep. They don't belong here, do they? It's weird, isn't it? You were right... ...about the deer, I mean. Oh my God. What? It wasn't me. Shit. What's wrong? We've got to go back to the van. - What have you left? - My camera. I must have left it on the dash. Christ, Larri, I thought it was important. It is important. Come on. Seriously, I'll teach you a few basic chords. Why not? You just do that. That's a "C". It's easy. I'm not very musical, to be honest. You can make it out of pretty much anything... ...leaves, twigs, anything you find. It's really quite effective as well. - Really? - Yeah yeah. What's Milk doing? Dick. Milk, what are you doing? Eggs for breakfast. Come on, mate, get down. It's not safe up there. Milk, don't be so stupid. Larri, tell him to get down. Milk, you come down here right this instant. I got some. I got some. You hear that? Go go! Milk, come on, get up. Come on, let's go. Come here. Are you all right? This is weird. Be careful now. Hey, Jess, do you want to have a look down there? Hello? They've probably gone for a walk. Looks like they've been gone some time. Maybe something happened to them. - Like what? - Like an accident. Shouldn't we tell someone? Tell who? No signal. We are in the middle of the woods. All right, we'll come back tomorrow, see if they're around, yeah? Come on, let's get moving. It'll be dark soon. We've got a fair way to go yet. It's really nice out here, isn't it? It's really quiet and peaceful. A bit spooky, though. Yeah, but look at the stars. You don't get that in the city. Oh, it's incredible. Anyone fancy a smoke? There you go... ...for you, Princess. Aw, thanks, sweetheart. Stop it. Stop it. Leave me alone. Ugh, that's it. I'm gonna lock myself in the tent. There are far too many things... ...creeping or crawling around out here. - 'Night. - Good night. Good night, all. You coming to bed? Suppose, if I have to. But we haven't told the scary campfire stories yet. Don't forget to put the fire out. I think I'll crash too. Well, I ain't sitting out here on my own. - Oi. - Hey. Oh, baby. You okay? Great. You? Yeah, fine. Baby. Your cock is so big. I love your body, Larri. I want you inside me. Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm just not very... Just... - Oh, baby. - Oh, baby. - God, I love you. - How much? More than anything. More than your mom. Oh. What the fuck was that? Can you see anything? Nothing. You don't reckon it was Milk and Jess... ...fucking around with us, do you? I suppose it could be. You should go and check on them. Will you be all right? You're only a few feet away. Webb. What? Be careful. - Wait. - Get the fuck off me. - Why did you attack me? - I didn't know who it was. Anyway, you shouldn't play stupid games. What was the scream for? We didn't scream. We thought it was you messing around... ...trying to scare us. That wasn't you? That's what she said. So if you didn't scream... ...who did? I'm not having fun anymore. Maybe we should make another fire. No, the ground's too wet. We need to gather more sticks anyway. I think we all better get back inside. Yeah, I think she's right. I think we should stay together. The tents aren't big enough. I mean... I think it's best if we all get back inside. - Wait, but... - That is decided. Come on, let's get inside. Webb... ...really, what do you think it was? Dick. I'm sorry. You were sleeping. I was very hungry. Hey, don't worry. Help yourself. I'm Webb. What's your name? Ketsy. Mm, making breakfast? You're such a sweetheart. That's just Larri. Larri, meet Ketsy. You look frozen. Thank you. What's going on? - Are you here on your own? - Let her eat, babe. It's okay. It must seem strange... ...me just appearing. I was camping not far from here... ...with my boyfriend. We were together, playing chess in the tent. Rob ran out to check the fire... ...and he was gone. So he left you out here on your own? He wouldn't. He was just gone. We need to get you to the police. No, I have to find him. I can't leave. Well, we'll help. If we all search... ...we'll find him soon enough, don't worry. Would you like to get cleaned up? There's a lake just through those trees. - I'll wash there. - Just through the trees? No, we passed that way last night. We would have seen it. I passed it this morning. Let's go take a look. Once we've cleared up... ...we will find your boyfriend. Is it just me, or is Ketsy a bit odd? I suppose, a bit. It just all sounds so strange... ...the whole missing-boyfriend thing. Come on. So are you guys still up for a swim? I bet it's cold. Don't be such an old lady, come on. No, I might go in later. Yeah, I think I might stay out here with you. Well, we're here now, so... Come on. Are you not going in? No. I can't swim. - You can't swim? - No. So why did you want to come to the lake? 'Cause you were. Larri... ...we're gonna go for a walk. You take good care of my little cousin. We won't go far. So are you happy to be here? Yeah, it's nice to be away from the city. Yeah, but... ...are you happy to be here with me? I'm hungry. You should have had some breakfast. I'm gonna have some now. Are you coming? Um, no, I'm gonna stay in for a bit longer. Don't you wanna dry me up and rub me down? Um... I'll do it later. Hey, feeling better? So when we get back to the city... ...do you want to go out properly? Yeah, I'd like that. I'm not gonna dunk you. Let's go together, all right? - Okay okay. - One, two, three. - One, two, three. - Okay, again. All right, one more time. - Again. - One, two, three. Webb? - What? - Look. What? There was somebody there. There's nobody there. There's no one there. It's fine... Just us. They were watching us. There's nobody there. I think we should go back to the lake. What? There's no one. Milk, I want to go back to the lake. But there's no one there. Do you want me to go and have a look? Something just feels wrong. Webb! Webb! Webb! Could have been anything, a trick of the light. - Larri? - What's wrong? I can't find him. He went under. I can't find him. - Webb? - He's just messing about. Jess just saw someone in the woods. No, I was right here. I saw him. He was in the lake. He went under. I can't find him. I can't find him. Larri, I don't understand. You're not making sense. He's gone. Do you think he drowned? - Let's get back to camp. - And do what? We'll decide when we get there. Come on. Where are the tents? This is the place, isn't it? I'm sure it is. It's got to be some kind of joke. But the whole camp's gone. It's just like my boyfriend. Did you see what happened? It's like she says... ...we went swimming... ...then he disappeared... ...gone just like before. It doesn't make any sense. You get the police. I'll stay here with Larri. No, we stick together... ...all of us. Are you sure we're going in the right direction? I'm sure. Where's the map? It was at the camp. But we've been walking for hours. It didn't take this long to get to the lake. I guess we're just moving slower. Anyway, the woods aren't that big. We've got to come across the road soon. Water? Yes, please. Do you know what's going on? Jess saw someone in the woods. Wouldn't be your boyfriend, would it? What? Well, you said he just disappeared. Maybe he followed you to us. Maybe he's out there right now, watching us... ...and waiting. But even if I did see him... ...he couldn't have been at the lake too. Just tell us, is it your boyfriend... ...running around the woods? This is pointless. Shall we just carry on? Webb? It's Webb. Larri, no. Wait here. Larri! Webb. Larri. Larri. Webb. Larri. Webb. Larri, come back. What are you doing? He was right here. I saw him. - Who? - It was Webb. We don't know who's out there. Larri, look at me. We don't know who's out there. Jess! Jess. Jess. - Jess. - Jess. Where's Jess? What happened? Gone. Shush. Shush. It's okay. Shh. - Gone. - Shh. It's gonna kill us. It's gonna kill us. It's gonna kill us. It's gonna kill us. It's gonna kill us. It's gonna kill us. Let me go. Let me go. It's gonna kill us. What are we gonna do? We're gonna do what you said... ...keep walking till we hit a road. It will be dark soon. Then we'll walk through the dark. What is it? Nothing. Come on. Go back the other way. Keep moving. Run. Please. Larri, Larri, it's me. It's me. Come on, I've found something. This way. Get up. Come on. See if you can find something to barricade the door. - That should hold her. - Is that really necessary? What? She hasn't done anything wrong. Why don't we just untie her? No, until we get out of the woods... ...she stays tied. You remember when you came... ...to stay with my family that summer? Of course. Mom was in hospital and Dad was away. It was my favorite summer... ...like having a big sister. You even used to look after me back then. Remember when I was being picked on? You sorted them out. I couldn't let them bully you. They were twice your size. And now here we are. You've still got to protect me... ...still looking after me. We've got to look out for each other. If we stick together, we'll get out of this. You know something? What? I never did like the woods. What are we gonna do in the morning? Let's just try and get some rest. Don't think I can sleep. Try. I'll be here. I'll watch over you. Good night, Larri. You're already dead. Milk. Milk, wake up. Come on, we've got to go. Where's Ketsy? It's just us now. How did she get out? We can't think about that. Where are we gonna go? Out of these woods. - No path. - No nothing. Who would build a hut in the woods... ...with no path to get here? I think we came that way. So we'll head this way. - Are you sure? - Not really. But we can't just stand around here. I can't keep going. I'm so tired. Can't we just stop for a bit? Do you want to spend another night out here? No. What? Do you think Jess is still out there somewhere? Come on. - What is it? - Bacon. - What? - I can smell bacon. Milk, it's in your head. No, I can smell it. Milk, we should be careful. It's other people. They can get us out. Come on. Larri. Larri. Larri. Larri, please! Larri! Please, Larri! Please please! Larri! Larri! Larri! - Milk. - Jess. Where were you? Me? You disappeared. I was lost. No, you disappeared. What are you talking about? I was lost... ...so I made my way back to camp. I knew I'd find you eventually. I knew you'd find me. I don't understand. What's to understand? You're here now. Larri! There you go... ...for you, Princess. Where have you been? Looking for you. I thought I'd lost you forever. Well, I'm here now. You're okay. We can be together. What's going on? What do you mean? Where have you been? Where is everybody else? Forget all that. Who are you? Larry, you're being insane. It's me... Webb. Stay away from me. But I love you. You want to go? You want... ...to escape? One, two... ...three... ...four... ...five... ...six... ...seven... ...eight... ...nine... ...10. Can you hear me? Hello. Are you all right? You ran straight out in front of the car. I could have killed you. Are you all right? I think you should sit down. Why don't you sit in the car? I don't think you should move. Are you out here on your own? Is there anyone with you? Is this yours? Hello? What do you think you're doing? I'm gonna burn your forest down. You can't. Give me one good fucking reason. Don't do it, Larri. You'll kill us all. Please, Larri. We're still here. Don't burn us. Please, Larri, don't do it. You can be with us. We're all here. I want to be with you... ...forever. You can be with them. I will be.
