His village, for several centuries. Can you take us there? I don't know, Pastor. Is there anyone else in the village? Everyone seems to assume the monastery doesn't exist. If I talk about things that, then I have a problem. Okay, you will take us. Sorry, Pastor ... But ... / Please. Frenchie. You take a plane from Rome, take the bus here. Now I'm afraid, you're on medieval. Here in Romania Now you have to ride a horse. How? Postman duty, middle letter L Deliveries (Deliver) You're a smart nurse. You are like a Frenchman, but live in Romania. I'm actually French-Canadian, but don't tell anyone. Doesn't sound romantic I came here looking for gold, but after seeing its inhabitants, it looks like I'm destined here. So I helped them. As much as possible. That's a very noble act. I know. Sorry sister, how long are you a nun? I am not yet a nun. I'm still learning. He hasn't even taken it yet his temporary oath. / While? I don't even know, there is an oath while being a nun. Temporary vows will help me lead a life as a nun. When is the nurse? Or will it? What is wrong? All right? We walk there. His horse can't get there. Maybe you should find a new horse. This is not his horse, Pastor. But he was afraid of what was ahead. People here say this place is damned. And the horses agree. If I can ask, pastor. Why did the church send you? The church wants to investigate strange events. Related to the greatness of God. Or what is often called hunt for miracles. but we come here because suicide incident .. Yes, but that's only part of it our little investigation I also have an assignment from the Vatican to make sure the area is still there. Gosh. / I can say my opinion now, Pastor. Is it affected by the war? That's right. There's a story big behind it all. I tried to find other information about This castle, but there is no data in this village. Residents just spit, when they call it. Spit? Yes, everyone. Past custom. The cross that surrounds the Monastery is functioning to keep the demon inside, not outside. Already trying to contact someone else when you found the body of the nun? Already, but no one responded. Then there is a storage area. That was made in the early 19th century. Franchie, when you find the body, what are you doing? I moved, to guard the body of the element. Where did you move it, boy? To the ice room. Where am I save shipping items. After I found his body, I thought ... Maybe moving it will help ... Preserve it? You first. I have to talk one more thing Pastor .. I left it like that. What do you mean? He left me in position supine, not sitting like that. Where is the case like the body position changing from supine to sitting? Yes, Pastor, but I found him already died, pastor. / You don't help. Sorry? Pastor, what is that? This is a kind of key. That's the door for the people nun picks up things. So he doesn't need to leave the castle. We must bury it properly. It is there when people afraid of being buried alive, If you are very lucky, that can happen, you just need to ring the bell, For people to know, they make mistakes. I think being here is a mistake. That's where I found his body. How could it be? That it's been a few weeks. I told you, this place ... what the opposite of magic, Pastor? Hello? Forgive us, for not excuse me first. Hello? What do you want? I'm Pastor Burke, this is Sister Irene. Are you the head nurse here? Yes. You haven't taken your oath? Not yet, / Why are you here Pastor? We come here because Rome wants to investigate about death happened lately. Death lately? One of your sisters. That depends, with the rope on the neck ... So? And do you think it's good to bury him? Can you ... Get out for a moment? You also have to go with him. Do you want to talk about the nun? I promise you security. I want to talk with the nuns. So that I can help. I can't give you what you are looking for. Afraid, the leader cannot accept that They will send troops diplomatic unfriendly. Yes, Pastor, however, gate will be closed at night. followed by the silence of the night ends in the morning. Come back tomorrow, and you will find the way. Here is a lodge, you may stay there. Thanks. Why can't we talk with the sisters now? Wait until morning. Here is the rule of silence at night until morning. We must respect. You should worry about yourself. Or you will walk at night. It's better to come out than here, Pastor. / We will alright kid, come back in a few days. That's enough to find what we need to look for. Yes, pastor. Hello? Hey? I take this. Okay... OK... You mention hunting miracle before? Is that what makes you stop? Not... It's like, the choice of the church to ... Look at different views. So you know Bishop Forke? How are you? / Because of her who helped me when I was young I have a picture bad when I was a girl. My father believes that I'm crazy. Even worse, liar. But when the church saw me, he finally met me. What picture do you see? There are many.. Nothing is the same. But all ends the same. That is? Maria shows the way. What's the Pastor? I think about the same incident. During the war I was there. I was sent to investigate boy who has vision. Unlike your case, me believe and I evaluate I assume he is possessed. I do it according to church rules. Oh, my God, Daniel what are they doing? Is it successful? The church thinks so, they are believe the devil is out. But you don't? Help me, Pastor .. Daniel was seriously injured after the expulsion. Forgive me. He died after that. I think, I'm too excited at that time. That is a puzzle. Pastor ... Daniel? Please... Anyone, help me ... Please ... Sister Irene .. Please ... Pastor? Pastor? Pastor? I am here. Pastor? / Sister? Sister Irene! / I can hear you. I'm here, my God, thank you. Fast! Thank you, thank you sister. How can you get there? The evil forces suppress this place. Maybe the book can help illuminate. There is more blood. How could it be? That is a puzzle. Nun's head? As promised, We want to talk to the nuns. It's like, invitation enter that we receive. I will look for the abbot. Take this, Find what you can get about this, this is very important. Sister, be careful. OK. Hello? Wait.. Sister? Sister? We can't stop pray, even for a second. This helps prevent the devil for centuries. This prayer helps maintain this place. I'm sorry, it's been annoying. / Sister Rose is praying and someone is behind him to replace. I'm Sister Oana, we have know you will come. Follow me. "Black bear" What? One more round. I told Luca at home. Why did you close the mirror? / That it's a tradition if someone dies. You close the mirror so the brother doesn't see the reflection, and become a ghost. Someone died? Did you not hear? Lucas's younger brother committed suicide. I can't believe him, he's still small. 12 years, hang yourself on the farm. Hanged oneself? Why? Like grass burned, turned to ash. That's because of that place, the monastery. The devil came out and poisoned us. 2 people you are transferring, who are they? A priest and nun. Are they still there? Yes, I picked him up tomorrow. You found a body there? / Yes I'm sure you'll find 2 more. Get down to earth, every monster fear, burn the sky. Devil creature, name ... Valak Sister? Sister Irene? The death of Sister Victoria is the worst tragedy for us. But we still feel his presence. Among us, he is very obedient. Excuse me, sister. Sister Vic ... Sorry, we maintain privacy very much. We shouldn't talk about it. We appreciate that. Can you tell the history of this monastery? Built by DUke, in the Middle Ages. He performs rituals, And he calls beings from hell. He opened the gate so that creatures evil can walk between us. The church attacked Kastel. He closed the gate, with ancient relics. There is blood from Jesus Christ. The church cleanses this castle, and rituals prayer begins to secure the monastery. For centuries. And the devil is trapped until there is the bomb about the monastery. The devil has another way to open the gate. Sister Oana, last night, in the castle. I saw a nurse. He feels like he is impure. Do you see it too? I saw him walking in the hall at night. He looks like us, but it's not wrong one of us. He feels impure. He is disguised like us, for knowing our weaknesses. He is disguised so that he is can kill us all. What I'm afraid of, if he shows up the sign the portal opens again. That caused the nurse Victoria sinned. Sister Oana, Sister Ruth has finished praying. It's time for you to pray. You haven't taken your oath? / Not yet Then this is not the place for you. So go now. He can't, the gate is closed. When is the gate opened? / In the morning. You have to stay here. Sister Irene? Good night sister. / Sister wait .. Sister Victoria holds this is when he dies. Do you know what the key is? No. Now sorry, I have to go pray. You won't find another entrance, Pastor. Nun's head? What is your purpose? I'm afraid, something is wrong here. Like other places, this monastery have a long history. Not everything is good, but we bury it. Sister, I saw it holding a key. It's too late, Pastor. Sister Irene is gone. Head? Head? Sister Irene ,, Maria shows the direction Who are you? May God protect you. Sister Oana? God ends here. Oh, my God. Shut up The devil is getting stronger. You must go to the Chapel. Only a saving prayer tonight. Go now.. Sister Oana? How long am I like this, Pastor? How long? Daniel, I'm sorry. Why don't you help me !! We must pray. Now! Whatever happens, still look forward. And don't stop praying. Deliver This door is used for taking sisters needs, so there is no need to leave the castle. Oh, my God. Frenchie. I thought you needed help. thanks. Next time, use a rifle. This is used for emergencies, Pastor. Sister Sister Irene. That's Pastor Burke. Sister! Irene! Thank God, Pastor! / Are you okay Sister? Frenchie? What happened? We are praying. Everyone, together. Only this ritual can inhibit the Devil. Who prays? Everyone ... another nurse ... They were here, they prayed with me when we are attacked. The sisters tried to tell me. / Sight .. Like reality ... There is nothing left.. We must purify this place Pastor .. It turns out this place is not sacred. God What should we do? Take the cross in my sister's bag, sprinkle holy water. Here, hurry up. Hold his legs. I thought it was an emergency. We are late. The devil is free. No, if the devil is free, he is must possess other people. Sister Victoria surely the last nurse here. You know what to do. / No.. So does God ... That's not suicide. It's a sacrifice. So that the devil doesn't take his body. I don't know anything, but it seems the investigation is complete. So, Let's get out of here. We can't just leave. / Come on ... Why not? We must close the gate. To enter the demon. The gate has a mechanism, but we can close it with a relic. The Blood of Christ. Christ? Jesus Christ? Did the nurse tell her the place? This monastery has been found there is a tunnel. I guess I know where the tunnel is. Then, let's go there. Pastor, before doing that, I want to take my oath. Are you serious? My vision, I know it's a gift from God. And I'm ready to devote my life. Sister, that's a noble act. Embarrassing, but ... With my power. On behalf of the church, I accept your oath. There is nothing here. It should be here. They told me, this is the key to relics May be anywhere in this castle. It is here. You don't see her sister? What? Maria shows the way. Blood from God Geez. The holiest. Only the true bride of God who can hold this. Wait. What is that, we shouldn't pray, or do something? There is time to pray or act. Now it's time to act. I still feel the need to pray, Pastor. God ends here. We have to look everywhere, to find the gate. Hello! Sister Irene! Sister! Irene! Frenchie, please help me Of course.
