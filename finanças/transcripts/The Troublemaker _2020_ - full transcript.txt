(gentle chiming music) (pensive music) - Like all middle-class kids, you're brought up in a world that you think is good, and fair, and sensible. And, you know, it's gonna be a breeze. And then one day, you realise that it's not like that. You think you're great. You think everything's going fine. You think you rule the world. And suddenly, bang. (music intensifies) You push a virtue, material prosperity, to an extreme, and we've pushed it so extreme that the virtue has turned into the mother of all vices. So it's the greatest morality tale of all time. I wake up at six o'clock in the morning, and before I'm conscious of myself, I've got this great idea. So is that my idea? Well not really, because I wasn't aware of it. And do you do that? You wake up in the morning, and your brain's already on the go before you realize your brain's on the go. Do you see what I mean? And then you wake up. And then have an internal conversation that goes a bit like, "That was a really scary, crap idea. I'm not gonna do that." And then another part of me goes "Yeah, yeah, yeah! You know you're gonna do it." (elegant music) We've gone into this dream, druggy world of fossil fueled consumerism, right, and we don't know what's up or down anymore. We lost our bearings. (pensive music rises) There's this thing, you know, The Climate Crisis, but like everyone else, we're just going, "Yeah, I'm gonna deal with that at some point. You know, that's on the agenda. But not today." Most people aren't aware of the sky. For me, it's an object of stress. And at worst, it's an object of terror. I'm thinking that's whether I make any money. You know, that's whether I've got a livelihood. And I know that it's totally brutal. (pensive music continues) So I had this big business, employed about 20, 30 people. The biggest box scheme in Wales, delivering vegetables to loads of people. And then 2006, 2nd of June, it started raining for seven weeks, every day. And it was like a sort of supernatural event. Not a single outdoor vegetable survived. They all rotted and were eaten by slugs. And the tractors like disappeared in the mud and I was just like out of my head with stress. And guilt actually, because I thought it was due to me. Because you just can't believe the weather could do such a bad thing to you. And then I found out this had obviously happened to hundreds of horticulturalists all around the country, and people had lost millions of pounds. So this is why we're all gonna starve, is because, you know, it's not like, "Oh, we've lost that crop, so we'll stick another one in." No, no, no. That's it for 12 months. Life and death is a binary. It's distinctly non-linear in the sense that you're okay, you're okay, you're okay, and then you're dead, and then you never come back. But we sort of don't really get that in terms of food supply. (pensive music) If you're a grower, then you've got to plant the seed, and then got the seedlings, and they might get eaten or die in bad weather. And then you've got to crop the crop. So there's all these hoops, and if during any of these hoops you fail, then the whole thing's gone. And then you can't plant again because it's too late. So this is basically how mass starvation is going happen, is you'll get a critical mass of producers around the world that have the same problem. And then people will be ringing them up going, "Can't you supply more bread?" And they say, "No, because we've got to wait until next year now to plant the wheat." And they'll go, "Oh? I thought you could just get it off the shelf like everything else?" Our very success is going to lead to the extremity of our failure. And the success is to create a complex system. (dramatic music) The thing about a complex system is that you don't know when the crisis is coming until it hits you, and then it's so big that the whole thing collapses in one go. Although it sounds like apocalyptic science fiction, there's good mathematical reasons for thinking that everything's going to be fine, and then everything's going to be unbelievably bad. (explosion) (crowd shouting) People tend to put it in terms of the Arctic or whatever. What we need to think about is social collapse and fascism. Those are the handmaidens towards extinction. (somber music) A nice storyline is happy-go-lucky farmer got fucked over by climate change, decides to take the system down. I mean, that sounds great, it's a nice storyline but that, to be honest with you, that not what it was. It was already there. I knew this was where I was going to end up. I had to go through this five-year process of extracting my ego out of thinking, one, I'm just a nice, regular father, married man type thing. And secondly, I'm a businessman and, you know, that's what I do. And you see this all the time, don't you? You have these set roles, and people say, "No, I'm a parent. I can't do it. No, I'm a filmmaker. I can't do it." You know what I mean? - This is completely abnormal. I mean, I get involved with parent teachers association and things like that. But I don't do anything like this. It draws you in, and it opens up a whole new perspective that you had no idea that you would ever see. Why not me? That I do say. You know, well, why not? Why shouldn't I? I've led a charmed life. You know, I've been born in Great Britain at a time of great prosperity. I was educated. I've had a very good professional life. I've had all of the benefits. I've been oblivious, and now I've woken up. Well, the trigger for the activism was the IPCC Report. (dramatic music) - It is best to put this tonight in the stark and simple terms used by the scientist who produced today's devastating UN-backed report on global climate change. We have just 12 years to save the planet. Yes, you heard that right. 12 years to halt the seemingly inexorable slide towards global catastrophe. - Yeah, I can remember reading it and thinking, "Jesus, 12 years, that's ridiculous. It can't possibly be that quick." Up until that point I'd kind of assumed that everything was going alright. Maybe we could do better. But I was too wrapped up in my own life to be paying that much attention. And after that I got really depressed for about two months. And I really only came out of that depression when I made up my mind that some things were gonna change. - So I wanted to do what my passion is, which is how to radically change society. So I did is went to the fossil fuel group at King's College, you know, it's like divest from fossil fuels, and very worthy and what have you. But they're following this script which is, get on the committees, do a petition, have a debate, all this sort of worthy stuff. And it goes nowhere. So you go to King's College and you say "Look, we want divestment and we want it now, and if you don't give it to us then we're going to paint your walls." The name of the game on winding people up is you've got to wind them up, but not too much. Hello. - Hello. - My name's Adam Loxley, I'm the security manager here. I understand that you're one of the postgraduate students here. And you're obviously concerned about climate change, et cetera, yeah? I've noticed that there's graffiti on the columns and walls that we've got here. - Uh-huh. - Who's responsible for that? Guys? - Yes, I saw him. - Who did you see do it? - [Guard] He was spraying it. - This man here? - No, no, he did. - You don't need to do this. - I'm from King's College Climate Emergency. This college has been investing in oil and gas for 30 years. - [Man] Yeah I disagree with that as well. - 30 years. It's still refusing to divest from fossil fuels after 30 years. We're protesting and we're gonna make a change to this policy. We just spray chalked, you know, and started spray chalking. So this activist said, "Oh I was gonna put some of my kiddie's chalk on the wall just a little wind-up," and this activist person said "No, you wanna use like spray chalk, which is like the nuclear option on chalk." You know, it's like (imitates spray can whooshing). (spray can hissing) (chatter in background) - [Guard] Are you a member of Kings College? - Can I see your identity please? Well, no, it's not a public area, it's Kings College and I'm asking you to leave. It's not a public area, so get out please. Within five minutes the Vice Principal's down who'd completely ignored all our letters. And one of the best bits of my research was when he said, "This is terrible, this is terrible. All this is going to do is to shut down the conversation." And then of course the great line is, "Well, this is the first time we've actually talked, this conversation now." (imitates microphone dropping) So it was done and dusted as far as they were concerned. You know, they'd ticked a little box in terms of being environmental, and that was it. - [Crowd] Divest Now! Divest Now! Divest Now! Divest Now! - Divest Now! Divest Now! - Divest now! Divest now! - The demand was that King's College would totally divest from fossil fuels. And you go to an institution and they say, "That's a great idea, Roger, but we've got our processes. We've made our plan and that's what we're gonna stick to." But what you've got to realise is that's a social construction, right? It's not a law of physics. - [Crowd] Divest now! - Once we'd spray chalked the hall, the social context changed, and they went into emergency mode. And surprise, surprise, they had an emergency finance meeting. It is possible. I'd worked out my escalation. I worked out, in January I was going to do the front, and then, if I could get enough people, we'd go and do the central hall. And then I knew I was gonna go on hunger strike. I was, you know, scared about it, obviously. But I thought, okay, keep with the plan. So a week later I just march in and say If you don't sign the bit of paper saying you're divesting from fossil fuels, then I'm going to go on hunger strike tomorrow. I was sitting outside the front of King's everyday with my Old Testament sort of routine. You know, with my "Hunger strike day six, (laughs) day seven." And these students would be going by, and they sort of ignore it a few, so they say, "Ah! What, he's still on hunger strike?" So after 14 days, phew, (laughs) he signed the bit of paper. Because after about day eleven it gets quite tricky. (flare lighting) We'd effectively won. They knew they'd lost. Because a group of people had stood up for what was right. - [Crowd] Divest now! Divest- - There was no way out. It would be a PR disaster for them to resist it. Basically, this is the prototype of how to save the world. The code was prototyped at King's College. - Disruption, disruption, disruption, Sacrifice, sacrifice, respect, respect to the opposition. Win, keep going, repeat, expand. That's it. - And all of the pieces were dropping into place. At that point I really engaged with things that I'd never conceived of before. So I did Veganuary. The idea that you'd cut back on meat. That was an anathema to me. I like my meat, you know. I don't have a problem with the idea of farming animals. But the idea that animals take up such a vast part of the earth's resources, purely and simply because it's much easier to cook a bit of meat than it is to go away and cook some vegetables. There's no sacrifice involved in that. You know, it's merely a case of just changing direction. As a society we are being brain-washed to not care about the future, to not consider any of the consequences of our actions, to not think about what goes on beyond our immediate little world. We're all rushing around earning loads of money in order to buy loads of stuff and go on these exotic holidays because our lives are so empty. And suddenly here was this movement that was saying "This system, not only does it make us unhappy, but it's actually killing us." (ominous music) (wind howling) (ominous music continues) - The truly horrific thing about the climate catastrophe is you don't need to do anything for it to happen. (ash hitting car wind screen) Like with nuclear war you actually have to press the button. You have to do something. While with this, it's like business as usual equals extinction. (sirens wailing) (ominous music) It's like climbing up this massive hill to get people into another paradigm. Well, you start by saying it. Extinction. (laughs) You know, because before Extinction Rebellion, no one talked about extinction, did they? (ominous music) The power of extinction is its finality. Deep down it's pressing that death button. It's reminding people of death. And now what's happened with the climate crisis is death is coming towards us. It is the social equivalent of being told you've got cancer, except that it's happening to the whole of society. (singer vocalizing) (somber music) I'm not trying to convince you of this. If you don't understand what's happening, I'm not going to try to persuade you. It's not a message, right? Death is not a message. It's a reality. So you've just got to be who you are and say the truth. (ominous music) (singer vocalizing) (somber music) And it is possible for miracles to happen. Through your awareness of death, and that awareness of death comes in a non-linear way, you think you're fine and then a tragedy happens. And that jolts you, it jolts you into a different area of existence. And through that you become aware of a deeper sense of responsibility towards yourself and to the world. And if a critical mass of people do that, then you get what might be called a great awakening. (gentle music) - Protesters wanting the government to take urgent action on climate change have descended on the capital. They have smashed windows at the Shell Headquarters near Waterloo, painted their messages on the streets and blocked key roads. (energetic music) (crowd cheering) They've also blocked Oxford Circus with the pink boat with "Tell the truth" written on the side as part of what they're calling their full scale of creative resistance. (funky music) (energetic drumming music) (crowd cheering) They say that they want to cause traffic chaos and disruption. Are they achieving that? - Yeah, I think there's no doubt that a lot of disruption has been caused. I'm outside Shell HQ, just by the London Eye and, as you can see, protesters have managed somehow to get up on to the side of the building. (upbeat music) - The whole sort of proposition of mass civil disobedience is to create the crisis before the crisis arrives, because once the crisis arrives you've already gone off the cliff. That's the crisis right? So you have to cause disruption to people's lives. (crowd shouting) What disruption does is it gets attention. Nothing's going to change without attention. (crowd cheering) The second thing about disruption is it costs money. It costs reputational damage to the opponent. What's more difficult for people in this culture, I think, is to understand sacrifice. People that do civil disobedience are putting themselves in harm's way. When you put yourself in harm's way, people are interested in that because you're not fearful. And one of the biggest experiences of life is dealing with your own fears. So you're immediately attracted, whether you agree with them or not, you're immediately attracted to watching people that don't have fear. And then cognitively what happens is you think, "Well, why have they done that?" Well because they're worried about climate change. And then the next cognitive step is, "Well, maybe it's real, then." - [Crowd] Climate Justice! - [Woman] When do we want it? - [Crowd] Now! (crowd cheering) - You just need a small nucleus of people who are prepared to create civil disobedience. And it isn't just about Extinction Rebellion. It's about all the types of injustice that are happening, because they are all part and parcel of the same system that is holding us locked into this passive oppression. (upbeat music) ♪ Come and join us ♪ ♪ Come and join us ♪ ♪ Come and join us ♪ ♪ Come and join us ♪ - The 1% of people that are going to push that new paradigm, they're the people who aren't primarily interested in the level of carbon emissions. They're not even primarily interested in politics. ♪ Extinction Rebellion ♪ What they're interested in is becoming whole. (crowd chattering) (singing bowl) It's not that hope doesn't encourage action, but it also, paradoxically, discourages action. I'm in hope and therefore I won't act, because I'll hope that it's gonna be okay. But there's another logic which is, there's no hope, so I've got nothing to lose. And if I've got nothing to lose, I'm gonna resist. And it's not bad because people will, in a subliminal way, want it to happen. If you're doing a bad thing, part of you wants someone to stop it. I mean, I've had hundreds, literally hundreds of conversations with people, where people have said the same thing, right. "I knew. And now I'm going to do something." (somber music) What we should be starting with is not the climate crisis but our personal spiritual crisis. It's actually quite nice on a Saturday night to sit down with a glass of wine and watch a video with your family. Do you know what I mean? That's fun, there's no point denying it. It's nice to eat loads of food and go on holiday. But there's another logic. You cannot actually be happy after a certain point unless you go into some sort of service to something other than material satisfaction. If you keep going towards material paradise, you'll end up in material hell. We've been hear a thousand times before. Instead of people thinking, "Oh my God, this is something new and terrible," no, no, no. This is the stuff of every archetypical life. (choir vocalizing) The central story of humankind is you're born, you realise you're fucked, you do something about it and then you die. (choir vocalizing) There's a phenomenon here which we've ignored and forgotten and has been central to human societies for millennia which is that life is suffering, and through that suffering you become whole. And wholeness is a more profound and organic concept than something as shallow as happiness. The tragedy of life is the means through which you become whole and be who you are. So it's an aid. It's basically that's the thing that enables you to transition towards accepting your death. (elegant music) (wind howling) (choir vocalizing) This is an ancient, ancient story of corruption and then renewal. And what we've got now is like the mother of all archetypes. It's the final reckoning. (ominous music rises) (wind howling) (wind gets louder and louder) (wind stops abruptly) ♪ She's like a mountain ♪ ♪ Old and strong ♪ ♪ She goes on and on and on ♪ - [Man] Extinction! - [Crowd] Rebellion! - [Man] Extinction! - [Crowd] Rebellion! - It just felt as if they were being manipulated by a political agenda that said, "We want these people stopped at all costs. I don't care if they're telling the truth. I don't care if they're conscientious protectors. I don't care if the science backs their argument. I just want them stopped." (crowd shouting) (upbeat music) - The essence of what is human is the ability to make a decision, a conscious decision on what is right in life, regardless of the consequences. (crowd vocalizing) (upbeat music) - [Child] You're arresting the wrong people! - People think it's really miserable, but there's an ecstasy about it which is in the face of all this pressure to conform and to go with the herd, and to destroy and to annihilate. A person stands up and goes, "No!" And that's the glory of it.

Sacrifice is the mechanism through which you become more happy, but not because you're trying to be more happy, but because you want to be who you are. ♪ Freedom, freedom, freedom ♪ If you wanna to be really great, you've gotta lose yourself. That's the central paradox. So going to prison, yes, yes, you're losing yourself. Prison is the manifestation of my humanness. I am who I am, and this is what I believe. And we all know it's right. And you can do what you like, but I'm standing by my principles. That brings down empires. That's the fundamental spiritual material of every revolt and revolution. It's not primarily political. But obviously it fuses with the rage against injustice, fuses against the prospect of mass death. You get those two things together and that's like, phew, you get the dynamite. - What do we want? - [Crowd] Climate justice! - When do we want it? - [Crowd] Now! - What do we want? - [Crowd] Climate justice! - When do we want it? - [Crowd] Now! - For a proportion of the population, this is going to be heaven, it's because it's real. It's exciting. There's a whole cluster of different emotional reactions which are extremely powerful, and positive, and even ecstatic. Because suddenly the real comes into the unreal which is one of the most fantastic things about life, isn't it? You know, everything's like bollocks, and then someone says the truth and you're just like, "Yes!" - We've got you surrounded! (energetic music) (crowd cheering) - Fundamentally, you know where it's at. You've got this new map of reality which is, death's on the way, I'm pretty insignificant, I'm going to live a good life, and a good life in the context of the coming genocide of the next generation is to resist it with whatever breath and moment you've got. And that brings us back to the joy of resistance. All this misery around activism. It's not, right? Once you've made this transition, it's like an act of service. It's an act of joy. It's an act of being who you are, at last. (ethereal music) This was the biggest organized act of civil disobedience in British history. What April did was show that mass disruption and mass sacrifice brings home the goods. For the first time in decades, a political protest brings the center of London to a halt 10 days running. For the first time since the Suffragettes, thousands of people put themselves into a position of breaking the law. People know it's real through the actuality of the struggle on the streets. And that's a central function of Extinction Rebellion. So what's happened is everyone's sort of acknowledged it's real in the political sphere. Okay, so we've declared climate emergency. That makes us feel better, and now we don't need to do anything. It's like the alcoholic. You know, the alcoholic has been forced to sit down and admit they've got a drink problem, but as everyone knows who deals with alcoholics, admitting you've got a drink problem is a million miles away from doing anything about it. (eerie music) In war, everybody knows what it's about. You're out to kill as many as possible of the other side, as fast as possible, faster than they're going to kill you. And whoever does it best wins. Well, the non-violent version of that is we're closing down the economy as fast as we can. And when that level of social disruption is happening, or the prospect of it is happening, and it's real, that's when you're going to get policy change. You don't want to disrupt the economic basis of society without a good excuse. Well, as it happens, we have the best excuse in the history of humanity. (ominous music) - I can see how powerful blocking roads is, but you need to be able to go in other ways. We need to look for ways in which to efficiently close down the economy. And the aviation industry is the prime target because it's so closely controlled, and if you disrupt it, it all has to shut down. What we're trying to create in Heathrow is an artificial version of what we're going to face with the climate crisis. When the natural event happens then, very arguably and almost inevitably, it's going to be too late. This is the central point of what we're trying to do here, is to create the shock now so we can respond, rather than to have the inevitable natural shock later when it will be too late. - The level of disruption, even by shutting down Heathrow for the best part of a week, is trivial compared to the disruption that may ensue when we're seeing not just a few thousand refugees a year, but thousands of refugees every day. We're talking about a planet where vast amounts of currently inhabited land will be uninhabitable. People are going to be displaced. They will cause a refugee crisis like nothing we have ever experienced. That's going to cause tensions within our society that will inevitably lead to violence because that's what happens when people starve, when people are frightened, when people have nowhere to go. (pensive music) - So once you see it in that frame, then you can sort of understand that Heathrow is totally justified. While if you just see it in the little, you know, people can't go on their holiday frame, it's like, "How outrageous!" - Environmental activists are planning to fly drones in Heathrow Airport's exclusion zone later this week in an attempt to shut it down. The Heathrow Pause group have said they will operate a small toy drone from three am on Friday to put pressure on the government to take tougher steps to reduce carbon emissions. Today the airport warned that anyone operating a drone in the exclusion zone will be subject to the full force of the law. (airplane engine blaring) - I am now an experienced person on the run. I am in a safe house. I've got a disguise. Last night I slept in a car with blacked out windows. Yeah. I had made arrangements that I was going to come up to London early because my slot for flying a drone isn't until Sunday. And so I intended to come up so I was available to do any press calls that were needed, because I've discovered that I can talk. This action that we are undertaking has been designed to be safe, 100% safe. We're flying, as you mentioned, toy drones at head height. I don't want to disrupt people, I don't want to upset them, but it's disruption that the government actually listens to. Action is what is needed. And if this is the only way that we can achieve that action, then so be it. (plastic packaging rustles) Oh, I'm trying to get the drone ready to fly. I need to check that I've got all the batteries. I can use my arrest to get media attention for this. Oh, still have to be switched on. I have a voice and I want to use that voice. (drone whirring) A year ago, I was a really tired old lady. Now I am full of passion, energy, fire. So I'm more determined than ever. However I get arrested, it has got to count. And I am perfectly ready. If they want to send me to prison, okay, fine. But I will go out with a song in my heart saying, "Listen, please." (airplane engine blaring) (drops bag) Damn, I've lost a leg. I've lost three legs. (laughs) (drone beeping) (drone whirring) Oh. - [Cameraman] So Sylvia, what are you gonna do now? - I'm going to ring the police. Hello. This is Sylvia Dell. I'm ringing in to let you know that I'm, I think it's called Plimsol Park or Plimsol Farm, in Ewesley, and I am flying a drone. And would you like to come and arrest me, because that would be quite convenient right now? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much, thank you. Cheers. Bye. (somber music) I do this because my young children, their lives are going to be devastated by this. In the future, when I'm not around anymore, they are going to be paying the price for the life that I've led. And I can't live with that. This is about my moral obligation to those who come after me. They are the ones who've really opened my heart. I want them to be able to look back on me and think that mum did the best she could. (somber music continues) I don't want them to look back and think that I lived a frivolous life and then just abandoned them. I want them to... to know that I did everything I possibly could. (somber music) I can stand being locked up. I can stand the prospect of going to prison for however long, because it's towards the end of my life. I've had so much. Why shouldn't I pay a price? (camera beeping) (camera clicking) (camera clicking) (camera beeping) (crowd) This is what democracy looks like! - [Man] If we could have arrestables sat in the road, that would be fantastic. Any arrestables. (lighthearted music) (upbeat music) - [Officer] Right, mate, you going to get up? Or am I going to have to carry you away? - That's what civil disobedience is all about, drawing out the violence of the system upon oneself. It's a sacrificial act. It's not a conventional, materialistic, don't get yourself into trouble mate act, right? (mournful horn playing) Anyone who's watching this thinks this is weird, then wake up to what western culture is based upon, that Christian tradition which is sometimes people are called upon to sacrifice themselves for the greater good. Don't think that what I'm saying here is some sort of weird thing. What's weird is the culture that thinks it's weird. If you think this is weird, then you've cut yourself off from history. And history is coming back. (Officer) Stand up please Sir. (crowd cheering) And that's translating into ordinary people stepping forward to put themselves in harm's way to protect their children and grandchildren. That's it. It's new. It hasn't happened before. Not since the Second World War. Don't think this is "climate change activism". No, that's not what it's about. It's about people scrambling to save what they love the most. ♪ Power to the people ♪ ♪ Power to the people ♪ ♪ Power to the people ♪ ♪ Power to the people ♪ ♪ The people have the power ♪ ♪ The people have the ♪ - [Man] Power! - [Crowd] Power! - [Man] People! - [Crowd] People! - Power! - [Crowd] Power! - You can describe democracy as a technical set of arrangements. But there's another definition of democracy which is popular empowerment in the collective decisions of society.

And the biggest lie of our society is everything's fine and the climate catastrophe isn't going to happen. Well, once you've got rid of that lie, it doesn't just enable a technical solution. It enables a mass social revival, spiritual revival of what it means to be human. Because then suddenly we've got the massive collective project called let's try and survive.
