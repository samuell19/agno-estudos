Yes? Oh, no, Giorgio! Please, letme be! We just had lunch, we'll get indigestion! Besides, I don't want to, it's too early' Just let me read, will you? Giorgino, come and sit down here with yourwife, instead of pacing up and down like an animal in a zoo! Why don't you pick out a book and read, too? Great' Nothing less"' "He came with his disciples"' Just stay here' I've only got 2 pages' "In the morning the sun smiled upon them and"' He's marvelous, this writer' You must read it too, Giorgio' Hello? Luisa? Luisa? Hello? Oh, dear"' Excuse me, Mother, but will you call me up later? How's that? Will you letme go? I'm talking to Mamma! He's here, sitting on my skirt' It's Sunday, but there happens to be no game today' Is she dead? Not murdered! Jumped off the terrace, I know' Too bad, but you must have expected it' She couldn't spend herwhole life on that terrace' My sister's turtle committed suicide' Yes, Mamma dear, I'm listening to you' So, what happened? You went upstairs"' What? All night did you? Tell me! Embarrassed were you? Who told you what, Mammina? Giorgio? How does it affect Giorgio? - Did you tell her anything smutty? - Me?! But"' Mamma, no"' No, not at all' I'd like to explain' Listen, Mamma, I can explain that! No, no' Mamma, let me just say"' I've got 5 minutes, so let me talk You were sitting down watching TV' I was in the kitchen making coffee' Right? I bent down to get the cups and at that moment Giorgio came in' All he did"' I admit that he gave me a little slap' Maybe you did see Giorgio put his arm around me' Alright, he kissed me, too' You saw all of this? No, you're mistaken! Do you think we do such things in a kitchen? Mamma mia! And your kitchen, too? She's very mad! You want to speakto her? Mamma, please, Giorgio and I are married, it's alright! You think that we did it only to annoy you' No, listen, Mamma, I'm going to get annoyed now' You have no right to say that, he has the greatest respect for you' He called you "a laughing hyena"? He must have said it as a joke' What do you mean, he doesn't like you? He's always saying: "Why doesn't Mammina come over more often?"' He's only jealous of his privacy' We've only been married a year! Mamma, try to understand! Of course we love you' You want to come and live near us? Where? In the apartment across the way? They have it rented, I told you' A girl called Armenia' She's very nice, I guess' She knows a big manufacturer' She won'tmove out, she just moved in 'Alright, bye! Alright' You too, Mammina' Tonight, yes' Oregano, a little oil and a clove of garlic' Of course you need the garlic, it gives flavor to the whole thing! Yes, Giacinta is back from Brazil, she brought back papayas' No, not poppies, papayas' - In the Amazon there are rivers 600 miles wide'- 600 miles! Well, 6600"' I don't rememberexactly' What did you say, Mamma? No, it's nothing' Giorgio is a bit nervous, it's so warm outside' In Brazil there are underwater horses that live that way' Yes, it's true! Giacinta was there and saw them and you didn't! I was talking to Giorgio, who looked at me as if I were insane' But, no, it's the truth' Listen, I went into the kitchen, I bent down to get the plates, and at that moment Giorgio came in' Of course that's not all he thinks about, we love each other! I created a nest and I know he's happy' We read books a lot andtalk about cultural things"' About music, birds, books"' We talk for hours, he's not bored' He looks at me with those beautiful eyes, like a stallion' He does also go to church, Mamma! This morning I took him along to Mass and he remained till the end' Yes, of course Giorgio would rather have you living across the way' Believe me, thatgirl over there, that Armenia is so common"' Enormous hips and vulgar"' You wouldn'tbelieve' You've never seen such heavy legs, honestly' Watch out? For what? She's not the kind of girl Giorgio would pay attention to' Because she's vulgar, and the one thing he can't stand isvulgarity' Afterall, he hardly had any experience beforewe got married' In someways he's so innocent' He used to go where? What kind of house? Who toldy ou that? He must have gone to make a study' You know he's always been interested in social"' No, nobody is working here today' I'm making him give up smoking' He's down to 3 cigarettes a day' When he starts smoking, I say: "A kiss ora smoke?"' Most of the time hewants a kiss' Where did I hide them? In that little house in the hall' With the music box inside, that way I can always hear him' Yes, she phoned me' She kept me on the phone forever' They're not getting along' They're on the point of a separation' Yes' No! Tell me, she did? They came from such different backgrounds! And certainly she was no saint before she married' Yes, yes, Mummy, it certainly was' I know' No, Giorgio never mentioned her' From that point of view, Giorgio has been lucky' The fact that when Giorgio married me I was innocent is important' Not that Giorgio goes around all day saying: "Thanks", but inside himself I know that he's pleased' I'd better ring off before Giorgio gets nervous' Giorgio, I'll be right with you' Goodbye now! Yes, Mamma, I shall' lft here's an empty apartment, I'll let you know' l told you, a girl is living there' All she does is sunbathe on the terrace' No, Mamma! Giorgio hasn't even seen her! Otherwise, I know, he'd complain about her in notime' You know the apartment they're building across the street? The foreman can't getthe men to work' No, they aren't on strike at all' They watch hersunbathing' You know whats he said tothe "portiere"? I'm so broad in the beam I can't even ride the bicycle' Yes, she must be a nymphomaniac, sure! I've got to tell you this' Aman knocked at her door, he was selling books' She came to the door in her negligee' Her neighbor heard her say: "Isn't it hot today? Terrible!"' And he said: "Don't let me stop you from doing what you were doing"' Then she took off the negligee"' She didn't have a stitch on! Say hello to Julia' They're coming to take you for a ride? Nice! A brand new what? Are you sure it's not a used one? If she bought a new car to make us feel inferior, she's mistaken! No, he only wantsto show off' And I know Giulia' Mamma, let's drop it' Mamma, let me speak now! I'm not aggravated, Mamma! But it was Giorgio who gave you the TV! It was not to keep you in the house! No, you shouldn't keep it a secret, because friends tell me how my brother-in-law gossips about us' He despises Giorgio' "He's not good"' Anything to make my Giorgio feel inferior' Mamma, Giorgio knows just what to sayto him' He'll break his head one day and that will bethe end! No, no, we're not jealous, because we have enough food' To run a car when you haven't any food"' They'd be better off if they stayed at home' They could buy their child a meal once in a while' What do you mean? Oh, starting in again about a grandchild? When we are ready, we'll have a baby' It's not Giorgio's fault! I assure you that my husband always attends to his duties' lf they kept their nose out of our affairs, they could pay attention to theirs' What difference does it make to me? In his family there's been insanity, as we all know' The priest told my sister before the ceremony' Giorgio! Do you think I am a horse? Stop! Hello? I'm not angry' He's a brother-in-law, it's bad luck' Your friends you choose, your relatives you're stuck with' No, no, no, it's all the same' Are you offended? I can hear in your voice that you are' Then say something nice to me' I didn't mean to insult you, Mammina' Alright, goodbye, Mamma' For dinner? Chicken with rice and salad' No, nothing with pepperoni, you know I can't eatit' The curtains turned out beautiful! I had them turned up their ends, then added rayon' No, they're not too many! What is it? Signorina, could I interest you in some books? - Oh"' Come in! - Thank you' - Terribly hot today, isn't it? - Isn'ti t? - Terribly hot' I hope I'm not stopping you from what you were doing' Mamma, let me explain it, alright?
