[Music] - Good morning and welcome to the new school year, Bueller high school students. Whoa, Bueller reds! This is going to be the best school year yet. [Music] Today's quote of the day comes from sophomore Scott Pruitt. "The difference between a stumbling block and a stepping stone is how high you raise your foot." Thank you, Scott. And because we've used your quote, you will receive a voucher for one free lunch to be used in our school cafeteria. All incoming freshmen will be happy to know that the year-long hazing tradition has been shortened due to the dramatic number of students who transferred last year. Cheerleading tryouts will be after school at five and this year are co-ed become a cheerleader. Our football team also needs your support. Speaking of support, today's special person of the day is our star quarterback Connor Tucker. As you know, Connor led our football team to victory many times last year, but unfortunately he broke his leg in our state championship game win over Rydel High. On doctor's orders, Connor will be sidelined for the whole season this year and as a result he'll be spending his senior year just like the rest of us, watching from the sidelines. it's going to be a tough year for Buehler High School's favorite. Connor, we want you to know that we stand behind you. [Music] - Mr. Sansberry, you are partnerless no longer. - Hi, Berty - Hi. - What's up? - Today...
