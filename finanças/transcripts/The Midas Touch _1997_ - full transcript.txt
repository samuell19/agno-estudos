(MultiCom Jingle) ("Crown on My Head" by Battery Acid) * I'm running fast past a million things * Got my gold, but I have heart * All my hopes came on it later * And the lies that you once told me * I'm not here * Crown on my head (dark atmospheric music) - I told you, you got magical hands. Give yourself a raise. - Yes, Master Billy. (video game chimes) (butler clears his throat) - Luncheon is served, Master William. - Excellent, is Aerosmith here? - I regret not today, sir. Something about a concert in Europe. - Just as well. I'm in a grunge mood anyway. - May I have your permission to telephone Jam Pearl, sir? - Excellent idea. - Indeed, sir. - You know what the bad thing about being extremely rich is, Jeeves? - No, sir. - Me neither. (roaring motorcycle engine) Hey, Granny. How far you go today? - 10 miles. - 10 miles? - I know. I think I'll leave the leg weights at home next time. (chuckles) (cracking thunder) Sounds like rain. - Good, holefield can touch it. Lobster again? You've got to be joking me. - Just shut up and eat. - I don't need to take this from you. Drop and give me 50, now. - [Waiter] Yes, master William. - Hurry up. (bubbling) - Hey, moron William! Hey, moron William! - Leon. - Hey, idiot! Give me it! - Give you what? - My term paper, moron, it's due today! - Hold on. I'm not gonna do your homework for you anymore, Leon. This is it. - I don't have time for this, Bright. I gotta go to the Cooks' house to get my science project. Now give me the work. - Only if you promise this is the last time. - I promise not to come up there and rip your ears off if you give me it now! - Good enough. - It better be good! Hey! This isn't typed! - Of course it's not typed. The typewriter's jammed and we don't have enough money to fix it. Just copy it over in your own handwriting. - I don't pay you do I have to go redo the work myself. - Leon, you don't pay me. - Hey, we've got an arrangement. You do my work, I don't kill you. I would never insult our friendship by offering you money. - Insult me! - Okay. You're a dork. See you around. (melancholic music) - I wish you were still here, Mom and Dad. (sighs) Hey, Cecil. Hey. Hey, baby. How about somethin' to eat, hm? Come on. - Good morning, Billy! - Hey, Gran. Made you some breakfast. - Oh, what would I do without my Billy? - Got you some oatmeal. Some juice. What else? - Toast! - Toast! Ouch. Damnit, I'm such an idiot. - Oh no, don't be silly. I like my toast, uh, black. - I don't do anything right. - Yes you do. You do a lot of things right. - Yeah sure, name one. - I can name a million. You're smart, good-looking, and you have a big heart. - You have to say that, you're my grandmother. - I wouldn't say it if I didn't mean it. (chuckles) You're a wonderful boy who takes good care of his granny. - I just wish things were like they used to be. When you owned the grocery store and your heart was okay. - Well I know, dear, but I'm just not well enough to really run the store. Now Mrs. Lower, she was very good about it. - Granny, maybe I could quit school and get a job. The newspaper route isn't enough. - Sweety, you're too young. You belong in school. - I'm always too something. Too short, too young. - Stop that! Where's your pride, dear? You can do anything. Now repeat the two Cs with me. - Granny, I don't wanna recite the two Cs. I want a new bike, a big house. A personal masseuse who calls me Beely. - Come on! I have courage! I am confident! - [Billy] I have courage. - [Granny] I have courage! - [Billy] I am confident. - [Granny] I am confident! - [Billy] I have courage. - [Granny] I have courage! - [Billy] I am confident. - [Granny] I am confident! Billy, one of these days, you're gonna grow up and you will have everything. You will be just like King Midas. (chuckles) - And everything I touch will turn to gold, I know, I know. - In the meantime, Your Majesty, go to school. (upbeat music) Now, come here. Give your granny a great big hug. - All right, Granny. See you after school. - [Granny] With your parents gone, I couldn't keep up with the store. I had to let Mrs. Lower buy me out. - Hey, Hannah. - Hey, Billy. What's up? Do you like my new bike? My dad just bought it for me yesterday. - What's wrong with your old one? - Eh, it was a piece of trash. Well, no offense or anything. - Hey, my bike's not trash! This is a finely-tuned state-of-the-art riding machine. (clattering and squeaking) Uh. It's supposed to do that. You can take it with you. It's portable! - What a creepy place that is. - [Billy] Yeah. It's definitely weird. (dark atmospheric music) - I wonder what Mrs. Latimer looks like. - The rich lady? She's seven-foot-tall. Satanic tattoos from head to toe. Razor-sharp fingernails 20-inches-long. Oh yeah, and blue eyes. - [Hannah] Wait a minute. Nobody's ever seen her. How would you know? - Not true. You know my gym teacher, Mr. Devita? Well his friend's cousin's cousin knows a guy who sat next to a man on a plane who saw her. So it's pretty much a fact. - Wow. No wonder she never comes out of the house. - How do you think she gets her groceries? - I heard she eats bugs and stray dogs. - Nasty! - Do you remember when the Millers' Great Dane disappeared? I heard that she made him into a dip, then ate him with wheat crackers. - Now wait a second. Now if she never leaves the house, how did she get her wheat crackers? - She has these powers, like a witch or something. - Hey, you see that hourglass up there? I heard it once belonged to the wicked witch of the west. - No, that's from the Wizard of Oz. There's no such thing. She's coming! (cracking thunder) (school bell rings) (background chatter) - Come on, I'll be late! - Give me a quarter and you can go by. - Get out of my way. (Billy groans) - Make it 50 cents. Yeah, right? Pay the toll right. - What a wuss. - Man. Here, happy now? - Yeah. - Somethin' wrong here, Bright? You guys need something'? - He took my 50 cents, for lunch! - Give me! Or else. What would you do without me around, Bright? (rock music) - Can I have my 50 cents back now? - No. I just saved your butt. That's the price for life. - Leon, put your foot down. Where is your assignment? (spits) (thud) (soft giggling) - William, Leon? - [Billy] Who, me? - [Leon] Who, me? - It seems to me that you both have acquired the same, exact handwriting style. - There is a perfectly good and believable explanation for this, Miss Henderson. - Well, I'd like to hear it. - Now? - Right now. - Tell her, Bright! - Well you see, Miss Henderson, um. Leon broke his hand in a freak lawnmower accident and was forced to dictate his paper to me. - Broke his hand? There is no cast. - He's Amish, uh. He doesn't go for that modern medicine stuff. - All right, I admit. I refuse to sit here and lie to you, Miss Henderson. I did Billy's homework for him. - [Miss Henderson] I see. - No, Miss Henderson! - Well, I must say I'm very disappointed. But since this is your first offense, I'm gonna be easy on you this time. You'll both write a paper on what you do this weekend. Due Monday. - [Leon] Yes, Miss Henderson. - [Billy] Yes, Miss Henderson. (spits) - [Billy] Ah! - You're dead meat. - Me? I told you to copy over the paper! - You're not getting out of this one, bonehead. (rock music) (school bell rings) - Hey, Billy, wait up! I'll ride home with you! - Where is he? - Who? - Bright. I need to give him his daily dose of pain. - You are always on his case. Why don't you just leave him alone? - Someone has to toughen him up, might as well be me. (groans) What'd you do that for? - Well, somebody's gotta toughen you up. Might as well be me. Huh? - No. No spazzy girl can hurt me. I'm a marine. (groans) (background chatter) (groans) - Hey, what happened to you? - Oh, this? I was jumped. By eight guys, college dudes. Football jockeys. - Yeah, right. - Look, I went Van Dam on their butts. Hospitalized nine of 'em. - You just said there was eight. - Eight football guys. A couple of weightlifters too. - You're not that brave, no one is. - Listen, wimp. I'm the bravest guy in this neighborhood. I come from a long line of brave men. My dad was a war hero. My granddad was a war hero. My grandmom was a war hero. (chuckles) It's in my blood. - Oh, yeah? I bet you're not brave enough to go into the witch-lady's house. - Wanna bet? - I bet you a week's lunches that you're not brave enough to go in there for one minute. - You're on. (slapping) - Let's go, now. - Nah, I work alone. - And how are we supposed to know that you went in? Do you think I'm stupid? - There's an hourglass in the window. Bring it back. - Yeah, the hourglass. Bring it back and you win. - Fine, you got your hourglass. I'll show you wusses. Meet me back here in an hour. - No sweat. (electric guitar whine) (upbeat music) (cracking knuckles) - Thought you'd get away, huh? - I told you to rewrite the paper, it's your fault! (groans) - Figured out your punishment. I got a little job for ya. - [Billy] Ow! - [Leon] Come on. - [Billy] Hey! - [Leon] Come on! (dark atmospheric music) - Listen, I've had it! Come on, you and me! Hands up! - You don't wanna do this. (Billy groans) Now, are you gonna do this favor for me, or do I have to bust open an organ? - (coughs) This favor, is it life-threatening? - Define life-threatening. - Could I die? - Nah. Not really. Come on, get up. Get the hourglass. (wondrous atmospheric music) Go on, get it! (squeaking glass) Hurry up! (faint rumbling) (twinkling) (twinkling) (cat purrs) (cat meows) (door creaks closed) (loud clattering) (door creaks open) (floorboard creaks) (floorboard creaks) (cracking thunder) - What's wrong, Billy Bright? Cat got your tongue? (cracking thunder) - How'd you know my name? - I know lots of things. (cracking thunder) You're shaking like a leaf, boy. Are you afraid? - No. I mean, yes. Look, I'm sorry I broke into your house. It's just, I-- - Want my hourglass. Well, there it sits. (Billy screams) - Come on, open, let me out! (banging) (grunting) (whooshing) (zipping and whirring) - [Old Woman] What's your hurry? - Let me out of here! I wanna go home! - You'll leave when I'm finished with you. - Please don't kill me. My granny needs me! - I'm not going to kill you, I'm going to help you. - Help me? How? - I've been sitting in this chair waiting for a soul with enough courage to enter my house. You, Billy Bright, are that soul. - So what are you gonna do to me? - Grant you a wish! - Can't you just let me go? Please. - Make a wish, boy, make a wish! - I don't know. I just kinda wanna leave. - What is it you really want? What is it you desperately need? Quickly, make a wish! - Okay. I wish... I wish I was King Midas. - King Midas. (rumbling thunder) Are you sure? - [Billy] That's what I want. - All right, extend your finger. Now close your eyes and repeat after me. I, Billy Bright. - I, Billy Bright. - Wish to become King Midas. - Wish to become King Midas. - And will accept the good and the bad it will bring to me. - I accept the good and the bad it'll bring. (dark atmospheric chimes) (screams) (screams) - Hey Billy, wait up! (chirping crickets) (cracking thunder) - Hey, Cecil. What's the matter? You can't sleep? Me neither. (magical chimes) Goodnight, Cecil. (suspenseful music) (screams) - Billy? Are you all right? - Cecil. (magical chimes) Whoa! (thud) - Billy! What's going on in there? - Uh, nothing. Just caught myself in my zipper again. (Granny chuckles) (grunts) (thud) Granny, what if you had all the money in the world, and you could get anything you wanted, what would it be? - Oh, I don't know. I'd buy you a new bike. - No Granny, what would you want? - Billy, what is this all about? - Well, how about a new heart? - That would be nice. - Granny. I'm goin' out and I'm gonna get you that new heart. - That's sweet of you, dear, but not 'til you wash those hands, let me see! - Uh, Granny, I gotta go. See you later. - You made me look bad. Now it's time to pay. - No Leon, you don't understand! You don't know what happened in there! - Yeah I know that I gave you a mission and you didn't follow your Commander's orders. It's punishment time. - Shut up and listen! - Why don't you shut up? Look, I'm sick of hearing your excuses, Bright. If I hear one more word I'm gonna bust some kneecaps. - Mine or yours? - That's it, punk. (groans) Hey doofus, what'd you do that for? - Oops. Sorry. Loose breaks. Are you okay? - Hannah, you wouldn't believe it. I was in the witch-lady's house! - Excuse me, I'm trying to give a beating here. - I was trapped, she locked the doors. There was this magical cat, my heart was pounding. She offered me the hourglass. - You didn't take it? That's it. - She gave me something better. - So, what'd she give you? - This. - A can? Big stinkin' deal, I could get 12 of those down at the Quick Mart for four-- (magical tones) and fifty cents. - How'd you do that? - That's God-like, dude. - I've got the Midas touch. - Wait, Billy, what? How did you, how-- - The witch-lady granted me a wish. I told her I wanted to be like the king. - Elvis? - No, Midas. He was some dude in ancient times. He had the power to turn anything into gold. - (chuckles) That's my bud! (chuckles) - Bud? - Yeah, we hang out together, right? - If you mean by hang out, you mean pounding, well yes. - Pound you? Those are love taps of affection. - Oh, give me a break, Leon. You're no friend. - Hey, when Billy was home sick, who's the one who brought his homework assignments every day for two weeks? - Hannah. - Oh. Well I thought about doin' it. (upbeat music) You know, Billy. I can offer you something much more than friendship. Protection, guidance. - Stupidity. - Can we lose the dame? - She's my best friend. - Whatever. Come on. Whoa. - Why'd we have to come to your playhouse? - It's called a fort, thank you. - Oh yeah, lots of forts have dolls, right? Very macho. - They're called action figures, thank you. Look Billy, this is the way I see it. You play your cards right and you could be the most richest, famous person in the world. You could do anything. Go to the Moon, run for president. Get ringside tickets to RumbleMania 12. I'm talkin' power. - Well I was kinda thinking maybe if I turned something big into gold, I could get a new heart for my grandma. - Lamebrain, idiot. Buddy, look we're talking about a transplant here. She would have to match with someone. - Match what? Look, Leon, all Billy wants to do is just get a new heart for his grandmother, all right? You're not the boss, so why don't you just shut up? - Why don't you shut up? - Good comeback. - Will you guys quit ragging? - Okay, how about this. I know a place where we can sell the gold, but if we go in with too much, they'd think we robbed Fort Knox or somethin'. So as I was saying before I was rudely interrupted, that we can bring in a few small pieces to get him interested, then we'll hit him with the big stuff, okay? - Yeah, yeah that's a good idea. - Okay. Here we go. (chuckles) Do your stuff. (magical chimes) - [Hannah] Whoa. - Whoa. Gonna be rich. - That is awesome. Hey, Billy. What's wrong? - I don't know. - Do you think you're gonna be okay? - I think so. Just kinda dizzy. - You want a cold soda or something from the Quick Mart? - Yeah. Yeah Leon, that'd be kinda nice. Thanks. - You see, I can be a nice guy if I want to. Um, pick me up some jerky while you're there. Extra spicy. What? - How much you think we'll get for 'em, man? - Uh, 4,000. Maybe even five. - [Billy] All right. - [Leon] Yeah. - You really think so? - Yeah, I got it all under control, don't worry about it. - Have you ever pawned before, though? - No but, but I know, okay? I'm the man. Ew, gross. They're in there. Looks like they're havin' lunch. Okay, you guys wait here. I'm goin' in. - Why can't we go in with you? - Yeah, why can't we? - 'Cause I'm the one with the fake ID? - Where did you score an ID? - My brother's older friend John J. - You don't look like John J. - What? - Firstly, he's good-looking. Secondly, he's like 15 years older than you. - What, you guys got a better idea? Didn't think so. (upbeat guitar music) (bell rings) - What can I do for you? - I have some items. - To sell? - Uh yeah, to sell. - How old are you, kid? - 18! I'm 18-years-old. 'Cause if you think I'm lyin', I'm not, I'm 18. - Year of birth. - Year of birth? Uh, 19, are you ready for the rest? 63. - Sounds about right. Still gonna need to see some ID, though. - ID, me? - Yeah, ID, yeah. - Look, bless your heart. The missus is gonna get a kick out of this one. (man laughs) (woman laughs) - Do we look like the supidest people on the planet? - You must think we're a couple of morons, this isn't you. You have blue eyes! - Color contact lenses. - Oh yeah. Yeah, okay. So what do you got? There's more where that came from. - Cora. Cora! - What? Wow. - Leon's showing him the stuff. Hey Billy, are you okay? - I'm okay. I just feel kinda weirded out. - What's wrong? You look kinda yellow. - So! You got these from a friend of yours, is that what you're tellin' us? - Uh, yeah. A friend that owed me a lot of money. So, how much are you guys gonna give me for all of these? - I think we should give him the super-special deal. - Not the super-special deal! How will we ever stay in business? - This is not about staying in business, my dear brother. This is about pleasing the customer. - Oh, right. My beautiful and ever-so intelligent sister. - Come on, guys. Give me the super-special deal. Give me it! Come on, please? - Well, all right. No, can't do it, it's too good a deal for you! - Come on, please? - Okay. I'll give you 200 for the whole bundle. - I'll take it. - Here you go! - Whoa, thanks. (woman and man laugh) (Leon chuckles) Come on. (upbeat music) - Let's follow 'em! Maybe they got more gold. - Those stupid kids are gonna make us rich! Hey! Get away! There we go! Wow, I'm tired! I gotta stop. - Could you park the car any further away? - I'm sorry, all right? Come on, let's go. Come on. Ow, oh I'm okay, I'm all right. I'm okay, I'm okay. All right. You know, I gotta park this thing-- - Shut up and drive! - Sorry. (car screeches) You see 'em? - No! Can't this junk go any faster? - I'm crankin' this baby into high gear so you just hold on! (bike bell rings) (hissing smoke) There they are. I'm gonna hit 'em off. - Hey, let me see. (man choking) Hey, that sign says this is one way! - I'm only driving one way. - Oh. Yeah! (car horn honks) (car screeching) (car horn honks) (car screeching) Idiot. (cars screeching) (clattering and smashing) - What ya doin', cheatin' us? - No, dweebet. I have a secret hiding place. Here's your guys's share. 50 bucks each. - 50 bucks? How am I gonna get my grandma well on that? - Like this. - Leon, I don't feel-- (magical chimes) - Billy? Billy, are you okay? Leon, something's wrong with him. - Let me see. - Well do you know what you're doing? - Relax, would ya, my father's a dentist. (slap) - [Billy] Ow! - He's fine. - I'm okay, I just need to go home. - Excellent idea. Headquarters is on the shutdown for the night. I say we rendezvous at uh, oh-ten-hundred hours. That's 10 in the morning for you civilians. - Hannah, you go down first. I'll be down in a second. - Okay. (peaceful music) - Hey, Leon? - Yeah. - Do me a favor, will ya? If anything happens to me, I want you to take care of my grandma. - You want me to kill your grandma? - No, not that kind of take care of. The real one. - Oh. Yeah, sure. Anything you say. - Look, Billy, I don't trust that guy. I mean, the whole Rambo thing. The helmet, the oh-ten-hundred hours. Come on, Billy, it's just not right. - It's okay. What's he gonna do? Like you said, I'm the one with the magic finger. I'm tired. - All right. I'll ride you home. Hop on. Billy, if you touched me with that finger, do you think I'd turn to gold? - I don't know. - Careful where you point that thing. I don't think my parents want a 24-caret kid. (upbeat music) How do you do this light? It was supposed to do that, right? - You know, it's gettin' hot in here. Do you think you could open up this sardine can? - You don't have to call it a sardine can. It's not a sardine can, it's 196-- - Would you shut up and push the button? - I pushed it, I pushed it, it's working. - God! - There, there, see? It's one of them kids who's got the stash of gold. I just know it, it's one of 'em. - Well we just ride to it and we'll be rich. Filthy stinkin' rich! (man laughs maniacally) - What are we laughin' at? - I don't remember. Let's go! (car engine starts) (muffled radio chatter) (melancholic music) - Billy! Hey, Billy, what's goin' on? - You'll be fine. You just need to get some rest. - What's wrong? What's goin' on? What happened to my grandma? - She's okay. Her heart was beating just a little bit too fast. - Well, are you gonna take her? - No. No, she's stabilizing now, but she'll be needing a pacemaker pretty soon. - Granny. - [Granny] Billy boy. - [Billy] Are you okay? - Yes, I'm fine. - Promise me you won't leave me like Mom and Dad did. I don't wanna be all alone. - Oh, Billy, I... - Promise! - All right, dear. I promise. - Is there anything I can get you? - How about a cold glass of water? - Cold water? I can handle that, hold on. (magical chimes) (sighs) Done. (running water) Ice tray was empty, so I hope this is cold enough. (screams) (smashing glass) (thud) (cracking thunder) (suspenseful music) (loud bang) (loud bang) (loud bang) (door creaks open) (cracking thunder) (door locks shut) (cracking thunder) - You're the one they call Leon? You want something from me? - No, I mean, I mean yeah. - Speak! - I, I-- - Just as I thought. No longer such a tough young lad, are you? - Look, I'm not afraid of you. - You should be! - Me feet, they're stuck! - So, you wish you could move your feet? - I'm not gonna fall for that. I wish to be like King Midas. - Your wish must be for something you really need. Your heart is greedy. You want only to be rich. You're not thinking of anyone else, no! I don't grant wishes like that. - Look, then I wanna wish for-- - I'll tell you what you want, and need. Yes. I know exactly what a boy like you could use. - A new CD player? (magical chimes) (whooshing) (screams) (cracking thunder) (door creaks open) - Billy? (suspenseful music) Billy! Billy, please wake up! Wake up! Billy, Billy what did you do? Your grandmother's gold. - I know, I know. I can't believe it. It was an accident, I mean... What am I supposed to do? - Look, Billy. You've gotta go back to the witch-lady's house, all right? You've gotta make her undo what she did to you. - What if she won't? - Look, Billy. You've gotta at least try, all right? Your grandmother's gold. - Yeah, you're right. I gotta be strong. I'm confident, I have courage. I'm confident and I have courage. - Billy. What are you doing? - I'm reciting the two Cs. I'm confident, I have courage. Okay, I'm ready. Witch-lady can't scare me. I'm confident and I have courage. Hannah. You'll come with me, right? Oh, come on! - All right, Billy. Let's go. Come on, let's go! - Hannah, wait up! Witch-lady doesn't scare me. - Red bird to sparrow, red bird to sparrow. The geese fly west in the summer. Leave the nest and join the party. (radio static) (man gasps) Sparrow! - Okay-doke, go for sparrow. - This is red bird. The geese are flying, leave nest and join party. (radio static) - Geese are flying and I gotta go to a party? - The geese, the kids, you join the party! (radio static) - The kids are flyin' and I gotta go to a party? - The kids are leaving the house, it's time to roll! - Kids, house, role. I don't know what you're talkin' about. - Get your can outta that dumb car! - Right, right, uh! Ten-four! The sparrow has left the nest! Right, okay, I'm coming. My pizza! (suspenseful music) Okay, you can relax now. - Shh! - All right, shh. You can relax now, because I've got extensive training in this area. I was a boy scout, you know. (clanging) - Quiet! - Here's what we're gonna do. I'll use my cat-like nimbleness to shimmy up that tree. (clanging) Sorry. I'll wallow my way up to the end of that branch, dropping down behind the fence, you see? Thus proceeding to maneuver a-break in from there. You ready? On three. Three! (whines) (chuckles nervously) (gate squeaks open) (groans) (thud) - The gate is open! (man grunting) - Upstairs. Upstairs apartment. - I knew that. I was just checkin' out my new crowbar here. Makin' sure it all looked real good, workin' perfect. - Bingo. - Bingo? It's not Thursday night. - That window! It's open! - [Man] Ow. - Hey! I have an idea! Why don't we go in through that window? You know what I could do? I could attach something above the window... Nah, that's not gonna work. Okay, I could shimmy my way up that tree, and come with over with a-- - Hey, could you help me with this? (clanging) (thud) (man groans) - That didn't hurt, I'm okay. I'm okay. Oh, that didn't hurt. This, on the other hand, is pretty painful. (clanging) There she is. - Well? Get up there! (man chuckles) - I can't go up there. You know I'm scared of heights. Why me? Okay, I'm goin'. - Go on! - I hate ladders. (door creaks open) (creaking ladder) (door knock) (door creaks open) - Whoa! Oh, yes. (creaking and clanging ladder) Gold! Willy! - That's the mother lode. - Willy! We melt this sucker down, and we're home-free. Rich! - Help me. Help me! - Hurry up and get in here, ya tub of lard! Oh my god. (Willy screaming) Hey, Willy! Are you all right? - I'm okay. I'm all right. (suspenseful music) - [Billy] Come on. - [Hannah] I just don't wanna end up like the Millers' Great Dane. - Listen, Hannah, this was your idea. - [Hannah] I know. What do I know? Look, Billy. Maybe the doctors can do something for your granny. You know, modern medicine's come a long way. - Hi-diddly-o, friends. - [Billy] Leon? - [Hannah] Leon? - Come on out of that chill! May I take your jackets? Pour you some lemonade, read you a story? (suspenseful music) Come on! Don't be afraid. (chuckles) Madame Latimer isn't here right now but, you guys can make yourselves comfy as I finish my chores. - Leon, what has gotten into you? (rumbling) - Don't you love it when she does that appearing thing? Isn't she swell? - Manners has gotten into him, Billy Bright. He was a mean-spirited bully. Not anymore! Why have you returned? - I... - Why have you returned? - I need another wish! I want you to fix my grandma! - Impossible. You only get one wish. - I don't wanna be Kind Midas anymore! Cancel the spell! - I can't. - Listen, lady, what's wrong with you? Because of you, Billy's grandmother is a statue, and Leon over here is a dorkus. Not to mention you've never left your house and you eat stray dogs. (magical tones) - Hey, what'd you do to Hannah? - Silence! I'm going to say this once, and I'm going to say it loud! Leave! (rumbling) - it was great working with you. Can I use you on my resume? - My grandma said one day I'd be like King Midas. Things would be better and they'd work out for me. But they're not! - I told you to be careful what you wish for. You must take the bitter with the sweet. - But she's sick! All I wanna do is make her well, that's what my wish really was. So we could be happy again. But I just went and messed everything up! - There is nothing more I can do for you. Now go! - No, I'm not gonna go. I'm a Bright and I have courage and I have confidence. I'm gonna stand here with my head held high until you change me back! - I can't. - Why not? - Only you can do that. (loud rumbling and screeching) - Save it for Halloween. - Are you chaps okay? - Just a little freaked out. - She wouldn't cancel my wish. Now what am I supposed to do? - You know what I do when I'm feeling blue? I go to the library. - Hello, Leon. Where's the old Leon, the one that we know and we hate? - Hold on, wait a second! Leon's got a point! We just have to go to the library and learn about the old King Midas. (suspenseful music) - I hope it's open. - Well if it's not, we're gonna have to break in. - That would be morally and legally wrong. - Come on, Leon. - Open, nine to five. - Dang it, it's closed! - Now what? - Guess we're gonna have to come back when it's open. - When, Monday morning? - [Leon] Mm-hm. - We gotta break in! Hannah, you can leave. I don't wanna get you in any more trouble. It's my granny and I did it and now I have to undo it. By any means necessary. Leon will help me. - I'm staying. - Good! (chuckles) So you don't need me here, right? - Come on, let's check out the back. - Great. - Hey! Hey, this one's loose! Midas, where would it be? - In the mythology section. Come on, go, go! - Come on, Leon! Come on! (guard snoring) - Where abouts is-- - [Billy] Shh! - [Hannah] Shh! Quiet! Now, I think it's up this way. Be quiet, don't make too much noise. Shh. (door slams shut) (Billy gasps) God, shh. Okay, got geography. History. Politics. Biology. - Cooking? - Hey, there it is, mythology! - How are we gonna get up there? There's no way up. - Hannah, step on my shoulders. - Okay. All right. - [Leon] I'll help you. - Okay, I think this is it. Here you go. (thud) - What? Must have been dreaming. - Okay. Okay, here's something. King Midas, King of Phrygia. Okay. King Midas, golden touch. Okay, here it is. Finally Pan, the god of the fields took pity on Midas King of Phrygia who found only bitterness in his gift. (sizzling) - [Leon] Ow. - Come on. He commanded Midas to traverse his kingdom and again touch all things he had turned into gold. Completing this task broke the spell and restored those things to the way they once were. - Yeah. - [Billy] Yeah. - [Leon] Yeah! Oh, that was close. - [Billy] Oh, that was close. - You guys, come on, there's more. But Pan said the task must be performed before the noon hour which follows the alchemy or those things shall forever remain gold. - Oh. - Man. - King Midas prayed to Dionysus, some Greek guy. The god told him to bathe in the river, Pactoralus. He did and the curse left him, immediately. - The river who? - Billy. You're going metallic. - I thought you looked a little yellow. - It's just my finger. - Billy, what color are your eyes? - Blue. - Not anymore. (Hannah screams) (suspenseful music) - If this is gonna work, let's do it. (zapping) (door creaks open) - Oh-oh. - What are you doin'? You kids know you don't belong in here! - I surrender. - Come on! Billy, remember to touch the book! - You kids know better than to hang around in here. Hey, what's that? - It's just a book. - That's gold. That is solid gold. Hey uh... Hey kid, get out of here, huh? It's all right, I won't tell anybody. - Please sir, I need that book. - Just get lost. - You don't understand! I have to have it! - What the... (zapping) - Ah, ah! - I touched it and it didn't turn back. - But that's 'cause you have to touch everything. Once you touch that last thing, then everything will turn back to normal. - That means that we gotta go back to the pawn shop. Everything I touched is back there! - Look, whatever we do, we've gotta do it soon. The task must be performed before the noon hour, which follows the alchemy, or all those things shall remain gold. - By noon tomorrow? - Is that noon, Eastern Standard Time? (thud) Ow! Do not strike me. I'm opposed to all forms of violence. - What happened to him? (guitar riff) I don't feel good. - Well, you know what? You will feel much, much better when you get some food into your body. - Here they are. Three death burgers, extra mayo. - I'm not hungry. My granny needs me! - Come on, Billy. You've got to eat. (magical tones) (Billy groans) (Leon laughs) (suspenseful music) - I think I broke a tooth. - Let me see. - Billy, your teeth are gold. - You sort of look like a metal mouth. - This can't be happening! - You totally look like Run-D.M.C. That was a compliment? Hey, there's the guy from the pawn shop. Look, he has a gold statue in his trunk. - Oh, no! They're stealing my granny! (jazzy music) (car screeches) - Hurry up, let's go! - Ow, my head! Okay, I'm fine, I'm fine. Let's get it out, come on. Come on, can you pull, please? (Cora groans) Can you close the door? Not yet, not yet! All right, come on, come on. We're gonna set her down here, put her head down. I'm gonna unlock the door, you hold her. - Hurry up. - Hold her for a second. - You know, if Ma could see if now she'd be so proud. - Why? 'Cause we're like, workin' together for the first time without fightin'? - No, 'cause we finally stole something good! (Willy chuckles) - You know I start to get real emotional when you say nice things like that. - Oh shut up, fathead, and pick her up! Go! Come on. - [Willy] Come on! I got it. You got it? - [Cora] Yeah. - I got it, come on. Come on, come on. (suspenseful music) - Guys, I think we should call the cops. - And say what? "Hi, I'm looking for a stolen granny. "She's 5'7, and oh yeah, solid gold." - Look, you guys, we got to the cops and Billy can't go back and retouch everything. - But, I think we should notify the proper authorities. - No! We gotta get granny back ourselves. And if anyone can't handle this, they should leave now. - All for one, and one for all. (upbeat music) - Sometimes you just gotta say what the hey. - It's locked. - [Willy] I got it, give me the hook. - [Cora] Here's the hook. - There! Maybe you could get up through the roof. - Okay, pull her up. - Watch out. (clattering) - Hold, hold, hold, hold on, you hear that? - You mean, that loud crashing noise coming from the alley that sounded like a trunk falling off a garbage can? - Yeah. What do you suppose it was? - [Cora] No idea. - [Willy] Right. - Come on, let's get her in here. - Billy, be care-- (magical chimes) (zapping) - Beautiful. He remembered to touch the ladder. - Yes! - Come on, get her up! Come on, pull her up! That'a girl, come on! Get her in! (suspenseful music) - Would you help me? - Oh, right. (Cora groans) - What the heck was that? - I don't know. But whatever it was, I'm gonna squash it. (Cora groans) (door squeaks open) Well! I don't see anybody out there. Let's turn this baby on, put her in, melt her down, liquefy. - Yeah, turn it on. (clunking) What are you gonna do with your half of the money? I'm gonna buy lots of taffy. - I don't know. I'll probably place a portion of the principal in derivatives and then I'll take the bulk of it and place it into 10% convertible bonds. You know, they're trading in tremendous discount-to-face value these days. - Yeah, me too. You know, I meant after that, probably, I'll buy some taffy. Okay, uh, turn the flames down while we put in the statue. Okay, you ready? - [Willy] Yep! - Okay, come on. Ready? - [Willy] Yep. - [Cora] One. - [Willy] One. - [Cora] Two. - [Willy] Two. - [Cora] Three. - [Willy] Three. - You go downstairs and get the rest of the gold. - [Willy] Right! - [Cora] (groans) Not now! (suspenseful music) - Come on, come on. Shh. Come on! (Willy chuckles) - She's be liquid gold in seconds! Oh! Downstairs now! - [Cora] Yes! - [Willy] Right! - [Cora] Now! - Okay, all right. (door opens and closes) (suspenseful music) - Oh, yeah. - All right guys, we gotta make this look good. - What? - Freeze! Reach for the clouds! - Sky, it's reach for the sky. - Right, sky! Do it! - [Leon] Say please. There's no need to be rude. - Leon, this is stick-up! - Wait. Why are your guns under your shirts? - Uh, because um, Hannah? - Because uh, Leon? - Because we're lying. (chuckles) - That's right, because we're... Leon! - You kids come to rob us, huh? - No. I just want my grandmother back! And all the other stuff we sold you. - I paid for that stuff fair and square. - We'll give you your money back. You don't understand, that's my grandmother you've got! - Your grandmother? What are you talkin' about? - The statue is my granny! - Oh yeah, and this can? Is this your uncle Herb? (suspenseful music) - No. Now give her back! - One step closer, and I'll melt her like a popsicle. - We got 'em now! (laughs) JJ, I'm surprised at you. You're 18. You should know better than to try to rob somebody with a finger point! - That can hurt me, sir. - Get away from him! (Willy grunts) - Tie 'em up! (clattering) (Willy groans and whines) - Oh right, okay. Everybody back-to-back, come on, all three of you. Come on. (children groaning) - Where is the other stuff? - Here, it's in this bag. - [Cora] Throw it in! (clanging) - Yeah. (chuckles) - Billy, you've gotta do something. - Leon, have you got anything sharp? - Let me see. - All right, we'll melt it down and put it in these buckets. - And you know what we'll do? We'll get rid of these three, sell the gold to the refinery, we'll melt her down, well um, we'll turn it into gold bars and then Cora, we'll be rich. Then I can buy that new pocket video game that I like so much! You know, the one that like, that video with the little bunnies on it? And then we'll-- (sizzling) (gasps) Think of somethin' else cool to do with it. - [Cora] All right, I'll heat her up. (whooshing) (thud) (Willy groans) (clattering) (suspenseful music) - You stop there! (clanging) (thud) (chuckles) Yeah. - [Billy] Look out! (valve squeaking) (grunting) My granny. She's gone! - Look, Billy uh. Maybe we could just take her back to your place, all right? We just gotta get out of here before they wake up, okay? We'll figure out what to do. Come on. (suspenseful music) (children grunting) - All right, let's go, come on! - No, Billy, you gotta touch the ID. Remember, you gotta touch everything, all right? - That's right. (zapping) - All right, let's go! Got it? Come on! - [Leon] We got it. - Let's go! Hurry, hurry, let's go! - That stuff weighs a ton! How are we gonna carry this all the way to my grandma's place? - No idea. What's she doing? - Why walk when you can drive? - Because, we don't have a license. - Well, we don't. But you do, John J. (suspenseful music) (twanging) (thud) (Leon groans) - I got 'em! Should be one of these. (car engine revving) - Oh, no. Oh, no. My Impala! No, don't hit anything, don't! Just 20 more payments and that baby was gonna be mine! - You just hit something. - Come on, let's get 'em! - Right. - We really should leave a note. - Go, come on! Just go! (Willy yelps) - You kids get out of my precious Impala, right now! Oh, no! You're gonna have to kill me first! (groans) Cowards! Cowards! (grunts) Cowards! - [Cora] Willy! - [Willy] What? - [Cora] Their bikes! - [Willy] Right! (clattering) Ow, ow! What did you do that for? - Leon should be back soon. (Leon panting) Hey, Billy. Are you okay? - Oh man, that's attractive. I look like a freak! - No. Billy, you don't look like a freak, okay? - Yeah? - Well, maybe just a little. But in a good way. - I got it. That should be it, right? (suspenseful music) (car engine starts) (children grunting) Uh-oh. - [Hannah] What? - Come on, we'll find those kids. - There they are! - Hurry, and try and not to spill any granny. - Come on, stupid, pedal faster! - I'm pedaling as fast as I can! Oh no, don't brake! (clattering) - Be careful! Don't drop Granny! - Okay, I got it. - Me first! Oh, I'm breathin' too hard. - Come on. Take it. - It's open. (Cora chuckles) - Okay, Billy, touch the buckets. Bring her back now. - No, wait! You grandmother might end up in two pieces. We've gotta put it all in the same spot. - All right, come on, come on. Pick it up. (suspenseful music) Put her in. - I swear I'm gonna pass out. - [Cora] Shut up and get up there! - I can't, I can't go any further! - Get out of the way! - What's the matter with you? Climbing over me. (Cora and Willy panting) All right, no more messin' around. - What are you doing? - I am getting in there, by whatever means I have to. So you just step back and watch yourself. (door knock) Room service! - How dumb are you? They're never gonna fall for that! - Oh no, Billy, the drain! - This should work. (door knock) Candygram! (chuckles) (Cora laughs derisively) - [Cora] Willy. - [Willy] What? - Let me see your head for a second. - There's something wrong with my head? - [Cora] No, it's perfect! - [Willy] What? (thud) Ow! (thud) Ow! (thud) Ow! (muffled screaming and thuds) (thuds) (groaning) - Billy, touch it! - [Billy] What's wrong? - Out of my way, sister. All right, you little twerp. Now give us the gold, which you stole, which we stole! - No. (suspenseful music) - What the-- (Billy groans) - Billy! - Now you're gonna tell me how three kids come up with all of this gold. - Yeah! (Hannah screams) - [Hannah] Let me go! - [Willy] You shut up. And you kid, come clean, or your little girlfriend's gonna go flyin' right through that window. - Okay, okay. I'll tell you. I got a pretty cool trick I can do with this finger. - Are you double-jointed too? - Cooler. Everything I touch turns to gold. - So, you have a special power to turn things into gold, huh? Well you're gonna tell me the truth, or this stuff is goin' down the drain. - No! (sighs) Okay, you don't believe me? Touch my finger. - (giggles) What, do you think I'm stupid? - Well you'll be rich. - What are you, scared? Touch his finger. - [Willy] No! Don't touch his finger, Cora. It's probably that farting trick. Remember when we were kids? - Okay, kid. I'll play your little game. (magical tones) (zapping) - I think I'm gonna faint. - Can I help you? Oh, be careful. (loud rumbling) - Wait. Wait a second, you guys. The book was wrong. You touched the gold and then nothing happened. - [Billy] I forgot something! - Get this guy off me, please. - All right. - Go. - One, two, three. (zapping) All right, let's tie him up. Hurry. - [Leon] Okay. (zapping) - [Hannah] All right, he's not going anywhere. - Okay, Billy, finish it. (loud rumbling) (dark atmospheric music) (screams) (zapping) - Hello there? Are you friend of Billy's? - But you, how? - Granny! Are you okay? - Yes, dear, I'm fine. But your friend there seems a little pale. - Hey, Cecil. Hey. Bet you're glad to be home, huh? (Willy yelps) - You don't understand, I don't even like jail! I don't like camp, I don't like jail. I don't wanna go away, I don't wanna go to jail! I don't wanna, you lousy kids! - What's with the gold eyes, kid? - Uh, it's for Halloween. He's going as King Midas. - Halloween is six months away. - He's getting an early start. - Guys, my whole body's turning stiff. I'm turning to gold! - [Hannah] We have to find a river. I mean, it's close to 12 now. - [Leon] But there's none around here, anywhere. - [Officer] There used to be one. - Where? - Used to be Wayland River. That is until the sanitation department took it over. - The sewage canal up north? - Yeah that's it, I used to fish there when I was a kid. Not anymore. - Guys, we've gotta go. (suspenseful music) - I know this place. - How do we get in? - You guys just have to have confidence and courage. - [Hannah And Leon] Confidence, courage. Confidence, courage. Confidence, courage. - Look you guys, I don't know about this. I mean, this is where Joey Beck drowned last summer. He was a really good swimmer. - They used to call it Dead Man's Creek it was so dangerous. - You guys aren't helping. - Look, Billy, maybe we could just do something else. Like, dunk you in a pool. - Or, go through the car wash with your windows open. - Thanks, but I gotta do this. It's the only way! (Leon sighs) - You'll drown in there. - He's right, Billy. - Please, let's just do this! - Okay, look, I'm gonna go first. (grunts) Ouch! - Leon! - [Leon] Help me. - [Hannah] Don't move! Almost got it. - Ah, great. Just what we need. - What? - There's a couple of kids messin' around out there again. Let's go rouse them out. - Ah, the heck with it. Call the cops. Let them chase 'em. - Thank you. I'm okay. - Leon, Billy will never make it. - Look, I'm gonna go around. I'm gonna try and find an opening where both you guys can get through. - Well maybe I should go with you. - No, you stay with Billy. - Okay. - You okay? Okay. (suspenseful music) (wailing police siren) - This is your fault! - I'm sorry, it's your fault! - No, it's your fault! - You're the one who got us into this anyway! - Would you two shut up? You just sit there and shut up. - I'll do whatever I want, copper! You can't tell me what to do with your badge, and your cop guh, oh is that a gun? I'm sorry, do whatever you want. Carry on, sir! I can't go to jail, you can't let 'em take me! I'm very fragile, you know. Institution food makes me gassy just thinkin' about it. I can't go to jail, Cora! For the love of god, Cora, I can't-- - Pull yourself together, man. (jazzy bass) - [Voiceover] All units, 714. Three perpetrators have entered the complex at the old Wayland River, they're described as 12 to 13-years-old. Do you copy? - [Cora] That's them! We're bustin' out of here and gettin' revenge on those little narc kids! - [Willy] Yeah? - [Cora] Yeah. - [Willy] How? - The keys! All we gotta do is open up the door. Hey. You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'? - What, that that little girl looks a lot like our sister Darla? Of course, Darla's got a lot more tattoos and facial hair. - Hi, little girl, little girl! Sweet one, come open the door. You little brat. - What did you say? - Come on, open the door, open the door for Cora! Yeah, that's right. (dramatic music) (door knock) - Hey, pal? Two elephants are taking off in your car! - Call for backup! (sighs) (car screeches) - Oh, Leon. What took you so long? - Fence goes on forever. I think I found a place where you guys can get through. - Oh, good. Billy, come on, let's go! - I can't get up! - Oh my gosh. He's turning into a statue! - [Billy] Get off. - Shoo, get out of here! - Great, it's almost noon. - We gotta carry him, come on. One, two, three. (suspenseful music) (Leon and Hannah grunting) - [Hannah] Let's rest. - [Leon] Okay. (wailing police siren) Wait. Did you hear that? - Hurry! Come on, let's go. - [Leon] All right, let's go. - You two are cops? - Uh yeah, that's who we are, we're cops! Undercover. Where are the little punks? I mean, the suspects, of course. - By the canal bank. Come on, I'll show you. - No, you wait here. This is police business. - Right! Police business. I began my covert activity training back in my cub scout days, although I admit that was... Excuse us. - Hang in there, Billy. We're almost there. (Willy groans) (Willy panting) - [Cora] There. - [Willy] What? - [Cora] There they are. - [Willy] What? - There they are right there. There! (Willy and Cora groaning) - All right, now what do we do? - Look, he's gotta jump in himself. - He can't, he's a statue. - Look, we gotta push him. - All right, help me. - You can swim, right? (Billy mumbles) I hope that's a yes. Okay. One, two-- (Hannah gasps) Let her go! - Hey you, be quiet! I'm the one makin' the rules around here now. So if you'll kindly step back from your little gold friend here, your sister won't have to go for a swim. - Bet you two thought you were rid of us, huh? - You guys don't understand, he'll die in there. - Shut up! It looks like your little pal's almost solid gold now. Let's get him! Ow, my head, ow! (dark atmospheric music) - Do you see him? Come on, Billy, come on. (suspenseful music) - Where is he? - He should be up by now. - Billy! - [Leon] Come on, Billy. - Billy! - Do you see him? Where is he? Hey! Billy! (uplifting music) (Billy gasping) - All right, Billy! (Leon chuckles) - [Billy] Yeah, yeah! - You know, I think you and me could work somethin' out! - No deal, fatso, you're goin' up the river. - [Cora] He did it! (Leon chuckles) - All right, you guys. I don't wanna see you playing around here anymore. This water ain't for swimmin'. As some of you may have found out. - [Children] (laughing) Yes, sir. We understand, sir. - All right, get out of here. - Let's get out! (upbeat music) - So, we're officially buds now, right? - Sure, why not? - Hannah? Buds? - All right. I guess we can hang out together. I'll even overlook the doll thing. - They're action figures. - Action figures. That's what I meant. (children talking over each other) - Good morning, class. - [Children] Good morning, Miss Henderson. - Well, boys, do you have your assignments? - I hope, Billy, that now you will think twice before copying someone else's work. - Yes, Miss Henderson. (children laughing) - Settle down. Everyone take out their texts and turn to page 60. Leon? Are you going on strike again? - No, I just have something to say. Last Friday I told you that Billy cheated off me. (sighs) But the truth is I cheated off Billy. He was innocent. - Excuse me? - (sighs) I lied. It was my fault. I'm sorry. - Let me get this straight. You are apologizing? Max, go get the school nurse! I was... I was kidding. Van, go get Max. I'm not kidding. (children laughing) - Thanks. - Magic spells? Gold grandmothers? What do you call this? - My weekend. (upbeat music) No way. No way. "I told you in life to take the bitter with the sweet. "You've had a little bitter and now here's a little sweet." Madame Latimer? The witch-lady! Granny! (upbeat music) Hey, Gran. How do you feel? - 20 years younger. - Hey, you wanna race? - Yeah. (chuckles) - Oh, how was that? - You show-off. - Not bad, huh? Four miles. Beat my own record. - Looks good, Gran. - See you after work. (chuckles) - Nice touch, kid!
