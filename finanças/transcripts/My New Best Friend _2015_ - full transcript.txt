MAYBE WE SHOULD INTERVIEW SOME WITNESSES. COOP, HOW ABOUT JUST A "SORRY"? OKAY. SORRY. I HEARD YOU HAD A 10-DAY UNPAYCATION. A WHAT? YOU KNOW, A VACATION WITHOUT PAY... AN "UNPAYCATION." AH... WELL, IT WASN'T ALL BAD. AT LEAST THERE WAS A THREE-FOOT SWELL BREWING. I SURFED 7 OF THE 10 DAYS. WELL, AT LEAST YOU GOT A NEW DOG. OH, LUEY? YEAH. HE'S A PIECE OF WORK. COULDN'T FIND HIS BUTT IN A SNOWSTORM. NOT EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE AFTER IN A SEARCH DOG. HIS NAME OUTTA BE "LOONY," NOT LUEY. OH, HE SEEMS LIKE A GOOD MATCH TO ME. HEY, COOP! WELCOME BACK. WE MISSED YOUR SORRY BUTT. OH, YEAH. CAN YOU BELIEVE BOSS TOOK BUSTER AWAY FROM ME? YEAH, WELL, 10 DAYS OFF WITHOUT PAY IS PRETTY HARSH FOR SUCH A TINY NICK. THEY USUALLY JUST HANDLE THAT WITH A REPRIMAND. HEY, PHIL. POLKA-DOT, WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW? THIS IS A FIVE-FOOT PUSH-BROOM WITH MEDIUM BRISTLES, PHIL. WHAT I'M DOING IS SWEEPING TRASH OFF THE FLOOR. YEAH, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING. NOW GIVE ME THE BROOM. YOU DO NOT WORK HERE. I DO IF YOU LET ME. OUT! LOOK, HONEY. WE'VE BEEN THROUGH ALL THIS BEFORE. YOU'RE NOT OLD ENOUGH FOR A WORK PERMIT. I'M TOO YOUNG TO SWEEP YOUR FLOOR, BUT I'M OLD ENOUGH TO TAKE CARE OF SOMEBODY'S BABY WHILE THEY'RE AT THE MOVIES WITH THEIR MISSUS? I DON'T GET IT, PHIL. "WITH THEIR MISSUS." NO ONE USES THAT WORD. HUCK FINN DID. OH! IS THAT WHO YOU ARE IN THAT GET-UP? HUCK FINN? WELL... HUH. BABY-SITTING'S CASUAL WORK, LITTLE HAYSEED. IT'S HERE AND THERE, NOW AND THEN, NOT A VOCATION. SO LABOR LAWS DON'T APPLY. I WISH THEY MADE IT 11. WHAT? IF THEY GAVE YOU 11 DAYS OFF INSTEAD OF 10, YOU WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN HERE TODAY, AND I MIGHT HAVE A JOB. HO, HO, HO. SHOT YOU DOWN, COOP. YEAH, HE DOESN'T EVEN BOTHER TO CALL. THE GUY SENDS ME A TEXT! THAT'S THE WAY THINGS ARE DONE THESE DAYS. YEAH, IF YOU'RE IN HIGH SCHOOL. SAYS IT SHOULD'VE BEEN A BARK, NOT A BITE. 10 DAYS. COME ON, LUEY. COME ON. LUEY, DO YOU WANT SOME WATER? FAUSS, LUEY! - FAUSS! - WHAT'S THAT MEAN... FAUSS? IT MEANS "RETREAT." "COME BACK." HIS NAME IS LUEY? ODD NAME FOR A DOG. YOU THINK SO, "POLKA-DOT?" THAT WASN'T VERY NICE. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? TO YOU? "OFFICER." CARRY ON, OFFICERS. GET OUTTA HERE. HOW 'BOUT SWEEPING OUT A DOG KENNEL? WHAT? IT'S HERE-AND-THERE WORK, NOW AND THEN, AND NOT A REAL VOCATION. WE'VE GOT CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES THAT DO THAT. YOU'RE NOT GETTING YOUR MONEY'S WORTH. CHECK OUT THE NEW GIRL. I KNOW. IT KIND OF SAYS "DROLL," BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO SHOUT IT. WHAT'S "DROLL?" MOM, I'M HOME! HEY, BABY. IT'S THAT LATE ALREADY? I BROUGHT US FISH-STICKS. DIDN'T YOU WEAR THAT LAST HALLOWEEN? YEAH, BUT I, YOU KNOW... MIXED IT UP A BIT. OH, SWEETHEART, ARE WE OUT OF CLEAN LAUNDRY AGAIN? I'M SURE I'LL BE BETTER TOMORROW. I'LL GET ON IT. DON'T, MOM! IT'S FINE, EVERYONE THOUGHT I LOOKED COOL. I'LL MAKE US DINNER. UH, NO! NO, WE GOTTA DO YOUR MATH HOMEWORK FIRST. HERE'S THE THING ABOUT THAT, MOM. SOME KIDS ARE REALLY GOOD AT MATH AND THAT MAKES THEM FEEL GOOD ABOUT THEMSELVES. WHY SHOULD I ROB THEM OF THAT FEELING? I'M NOT BUYING INTO YOUR POLKA-DOT LOGIC. COME ON. SIT. MATH FIRST. COME ON. LET'S GET THIS DONE. WE LEARNED ABOUT PIE TODAY. OOH, HUCKLEBERRY PIE? I WISH. "DON'T IT SURPRISE YOU THE WAY THEM KINGS CARRIES ON, HUCK?" "NO. BECAUSE IT'S IN THE BREED. I RECKON THEY'RE ALL ALIKE." "BUT, HUCK, THEM KINGS IS REGULAR RAPSCALLIONS, THAT'S JUST WHAT THEY IS." "HENRY THE EIGHT TAKES UP A NOTION HE WANTS TO GET UP SOME TROUBLE WITH THIS COUNTRY." "ALL OF A SUDDEN... "HE HEAVES ALL THE TEA AND WHACKS OUT A DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE." HEY. HEY. I BROUGHT THAT TO, UH, PAY YOU BACK. UM... YOU DIDN'T... GET THIS FOR ME. YEAH, I KNOW, BUT I WOULD HAVE, IF I'D THOUGHT OF IT. YEAH, THAT'S THE OPERATIVE WORD, COOP... THINK. WHERE ARE THEY HEADED? PROTECTIVE SERVICES? AFRAID SO. UNLESS YOU HAVE ROOM ON THE HOUSEBOAT FOR THREE MORE. SURE. YOU WANT ME TO TAKE 'EM FOR A LONG-TERM PLACEMENT, OR JUST A ONE-NIGHTER? GIVE 'EM TO ME LONG-TERM. I'VE GOT ROOM. PLENTY OF ROOM. LUEY'S BUNKING AT THE STATION KENNEL RIGHT NOW, AND I GOT AN AVAILABLE CRATE. YEAH, YOU WOULD MAKE THEM SLEEP IN A CRATE. AND YOU'D FEED AND WATER THEM ONCE A DAY, TOO, I BET. KIDS EAT MORE THAN ONCE A DAY? - WHAT'D MOM DO? - SHE JUST WENT TO VEGAS... FOR A FEW DAYS WITH THE BOYFRIEND. SHE DECIDED SHE LIKED IT BETTER THERE THAN HERE, SO SHE STAYED. LEFT THE SEVEN-YEAR-OLD IN CHARGE. HOW DO YOU DO IT, SAMMY? YOU KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT. IF I KNEW THE ANSWER TO THAT, WE'D PROBABLY STILL BE ENGAGED. NO. IF YOU WANTED KIDS INSTEAD OF WANTING TO BE ONE, WE'D STILL BE ENGAGED. OW. YEAH, COOP? YOU KNOW, EVENTUALLY YOU'RE GONNA BE A GEEZER. SO WHO'S GONNA TAKE CARE OF YOU THEN? EVER THINK ABOUT THAT? NO. NOT REALLY. BUT THERE'S ALWAYS ASSISTED-CARE HOMES. AND I THINK THEY FEED AND WATER YOU ONCE A DAY, TOO. LET'S SEE YOUR FEET. HONEY, THOSE... MOM? A LITTLE COMPROMISE HERE? ALL RIGHT. I'LL LET THE BOOTS SLIDE, BUT THE DRESS STAYS. I DON'T WANNA GO. NOT WITHOUT YOU! I'M SORRY, HONEY. I JUST DON'T FEEL WELL ENOUGH. I DON'T WANNA GO EVEN IF YOU COULD COME. I SPOKE TO RUTH. SHE AND PASTOR JOHN WILL MEET YOU THERE AND EVEN TAKE YOU TO LUNCH AFTER. I NEED YOU TO DO THIS, POLKA-DOT. DID THE DOCTOR SAY YOUR BLOOD IS GETTING WORSE AGAIN? THEN THAT SHOULD GET YOU ON THE TRANSPLANT LIST. IT WON'T. I'M STILL NOT, UM, SICK ENOUGH TO QUALIFY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO HOPE FOR. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YOU'RE SICKER, BUT STILL NOT BAD ENOUGH FOR A NEW LIVER, AND YOU SAID IT ISN'T GONNA GET BETTER, SO AM I SUPPOSED TO HOPE THAT YOU GET WORSE? COME ON. SIT. HONEY, I CAN'T PREDICT THE FUTURE. BUT UNTIL WE MAKE FRIENDS HERE, I NEED TO HAVE SOMEONE AVAILABLE FOR AN EMERGENCY. WAS MY DAD REALLY THAT BAD, MOM? HE WAS. MAYBE HE'S CHANGED. OH... I USED TO HOPE FOR THAT, TOO, HONEY. HEY, YOU KNOW HOW MEAN HUCK'S DAD WAS? WAS HE BETTER OFF WITHOUT HIM? LISTEN, POLKA-DOT... THE LAST TIME I GOT WORSE UNEXPECTEDLY, YOU ENDED UP IN A COUNTY FACILITY. I'LL NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF FOR THAT AND I'LL NEVER LET IT HAPPEN AGAIN. IT WAS ONLY FOR A MONTH, MOM. BUT I KNEW THE WHOLE TIME THAT YOU WERE GONNA GET BETTER AND COME GET ME. RUTH AND PASTOR JOHN ARE GOOD PEOPLE, HONEY. IF I... EVER ENDED UP IN THE HOSPITAL AGAIN... THEY'D HELP US IF WE NEEDED IT. BUT MOM, THEY'RE PROPER... JUST LIKE HUCK FINN'S AUNT SALLY AND THE WIDOW. "PROPER" OR NOT, HUCK WAS SAFER WITH THEM THAN HE WAS ON THE RAFT. BUT HE LIKED THE RAFT BETTER. WHAT DID THEY DO? THEY ADOPTED AND CIVILIZED HIM. "THE END. YOURS TRULY, HUCK FINN." BYE, MOM. BYE. - TAKE CARE. - HELLO, PENELOPE. HELLO, YOURSELF! WE WERE HOPING YOU'D JOIN US FOR LUNCH, DEAR. THAT'S WHAT MY MOM SAID. WHICH IS GRAND OF YOU. AND HOW IS YOUR MOTHER, PENELOPE? SHE'S BETTER, THANK YOU. AND I LIKE TO BE CALLED POLKA-DOT. WE CAN CHECK IN ON HER AFTER LUNCH, AND BRING HER SOME TAKE-OUT. I THINK WE'RE COVERED, FATHER. AND VISITS ARE HARD FOR HER. YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN SHE'S NAPPING. WELL, WE'RE HERE FOR HER IF SHE NEEDS US, PENELOPE. AND IT'S "PASTOR." I'LL PASS THAT ALONG WHEN I GET HOME, PASTOR. AND IT'S "POLKA-DOT." WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA! HOLD ON, LITTLE ONE. DIDN'T YOU SEE THE SIGN? "AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY." OH, YES, SIR. I... AM AUTHORIZED. I'M PART OF THE "COPS FOR KIDS" PROGRAM. "COPS FOR KIDS?" NEVER HEARD OF IT. I'M ASSIGNED TO OFFICER COOPER-BRAWNS. - BRAWN? - YES, SIR. MY ASSIGNMENT IS TO CLEAN LUEY'S KENNEL. WHERE IS IT? OH. OKAY, COOL. UH... IT'S AROUND BACK. PENS ARE ALL MARKED WITH THE DOGS' NAMES. AND ACTUALLY, BRAWN'S ON THE TRAINING FIELD. AND LISTEN... SLOW DOWN, OKAY? COME ON! YEAH! FAUSS, GRIZZLY! FAUSS! GOOD JOB. GOOD BOY. GOOD BOY. COME ON. GOOD. GOOD BOY. HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? HEY, THAT BETTER NOT BE... LUEY. WHAT IF I GET A CALL-OUT RIGHT NOW? HE'S A POLICE DOG, HE'S NOT A PET! LUEY COULD NEVER HURT SOMEBODY LIKE THAT GERMAN SHEPHERD. HE'S NOT TRAINED FOR ASSAULT. HE'S TRAINED TO TRACK. HE DOESN'T NEED A BUBBLE BATH FOR THAT. I KNOW. I JUST THOUGHT THAT MAYBE IF HE WAS WASHED, HE... NOT ANOTHER WORD, YOUNG LADY. JUST GET THAT CRAP OFF HIM. AM I FIRED, COOPER-BRAWNS? YOU WERE NEVER HIRED. AND IT'S "OFFICER BRAWN." COULDN'T I JUST GET A REPRIMAND? FIRING ME SEEMS A BIT HARSH. I COULDN'T EXPECT TO GET MY $5.00 IF I DIDN'T CLEAN UP MY MESS. YOU'RE HERE WITHOUT PERMISSION, SO YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET $1.00, NEVER MIND FIVE. NOW, CLEAN UP YOUR STUFF AND SCRAM. COOPER-BRAWNS, WHY DOES LUEY SLEEP HERE? THE WEBSITE SAYS THAT THE DOGS USUALLY SLEEP WITH THEIR HANDLERS. I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ROOM AT THE HOUSEBOAT. YOU LIVE ON A HOUSEBOAT? AND I GO OUT AT NIGHT, A LOT, AND HE DOESN'T LIKE IT, HE WHINES, AND THE NEIGHBORS DON'T LIKE THAT. DON'T YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND? NOT ANYMORE. - WHAT WAS HER NAME? - SAMANTHA. HOW LONG DID SHE KEEP YOU? THIS IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. WELL, THE RESULT IS THE POOR DOG'S ALL ALONE, AND THAT MAKES HIM SAD. HE SLEEPS 10 HOURS A NIGHT. HE DOESN'T CARE WHERE. P.S., I HATE THE RED SOX. MOM, I'M HOME. MOM? MOM, WAKE UP! MOM! MOM! 9-1-1. WHAT IS YOUR EMERGENCY? HELLO? 9-1-1. HELLO? PARAMEDICS! HELLO? BASED ON HER MEDS, SHE MUST HAVE LIVER DISEASE. UNIT 39 TO BASE STATION. BASE STATION. GO AHEAD, 39. GOT AN ADULT FEMALE, PROBABLY LATE-30s, SHOCKY, UNCONSCIOUS. MAKE EVERYTHING OKAY. MAKE MY MOM BETTER. PLEASE, GOD, JUST THIS ONE THING. JUST THIS ONE THING. MOM... PLEASE BE OKAY. DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE. I NEED THE NUMBER FOR THE BASE STATION. IS THAT THE NAME OF A BUSINESS? IT'S WHERE THE PARAMEDICS GO WHEN THEY RESCUE SOMEONE. EVERY HOSPITAL THAT HAS A TRAUMA UNIT HAS A BASE STATION. I NEED TO KNOW WHICH HOSPITAL, PLEASE. DON'T THEY GO TO THE ONE CLOSEST TO WHERE YOU LIVE? NOT ALWAYS. WHAT IS YOUR ADDRESS, PLEASE? I KNOW! IF THEY HAVE 12 MICE TOTAL, AND MARY HAS SIX MORE MICE THAN RALPH, RALPH HAS THREE MICE, AND MARY HAS NINE MICE. 9 PLUS 3 EQUALS 12. IS THERE SOMEONE ELSE IN SOCIAL SERVICES I COULD SPEAK TO? PARAMEDICS SAID SHE CALLED 9-1-1 HERSELF, THEN MUST'VE PASSED OUT. NO VISITORS HAVE SHOWN UP. HER I.D. JUST LISTS AN OLD ADDRESS AND AN OLD LAND-LINE. I WAS HOPING YOU COULD HELP. THIS ISN'T A NEW ONSET DIAGNOSIS, SO SHE MUST HAVE HAD A DOCTOR BEFORE SHE MOVED HERE. IF NO ONE SHOWS UP WITHIN A FEW DAYS, WE CAN CALL THE POLICE, ASK THEM TO GO THERE, AND DIG AROUND. OKAY. YOU DESERTING RED SOX NATION? THE INTERNET SAYS TO BE CAREFUL WITH THESE FLOPPY EARS. WHY? WELL, THEY KEEP THE WIND FROM BLOWING AWAY THE SKIN CELLS HE PICKED UP ON THE TRAIL. IT'S HOW HE HUNTS. SO THE SCENT STAYS IN HERE? IT'S CALLED "THE SHAWL." DIDN'T YOU LEARN THAT ON THE INTERNET? HOW LONG CAN LUEY FIND THE TRAIL AFTER A BANDIT'S DISAPPEARED? WELL, IT DEPENDS ON HOW HOT OR COLD THE TRAIL IS, AND IT'S NOT A "BANDIT," IT'S A CRIMINAL, AND THEY DON'T JUST FIND CRIMINALS. THAT WAS MY NEXT QUESTION! CAN'T LUEY FIND REGULAR LOST PEOPLE, TOO? YEAH, SURE. AS LONG AS WE HAVE A SCENT ARTICLE TO START THE TRAIL. BUT SAY THEY WERE MISSING FOR A WHILE, LIKE... SAY, A WEEK. COULD LUEY STILL FIND THEM THEN? MAYBE. MAYBE NOT. HOTTER THE TRAIL, THE BETTER. GIVE HIM FRESH WATER BEFORE YOU LEAVE. I WILL. - THIS IS LUEY? - YEAH. HI. HI! YOU'RE SO CUTE! YOU KEEP HIM SO CLEAN. UM... COOP. LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING TO YOU. JUST STAY WITH ME ON THIS. SURE. UNLESS, LAST NIGHT, WHEN I WENT HOME, YOU GOT TRANSFERRED TO SOCIAL SERVICES AND I GOT FIRED, THERE IS NO NEED FOR YOU TO BE SITTING IN MY SPOT. WELL, I WAS CONCERNED. YEAH? ABOUT WHAT? WELL, YOU HAVEN'T BEEN BY METRO TO CHECK ON ME IN A FEW DAYS, SO I WAS WORRIED. YOU WERE WORRIED ABOUT ME NOT CHECKING ON YOU? YEAH. COOP, TO SPLIT... "TO SEPARATE OR DIVIDE INTO PARTS"... SUCH AS A RELATIONSHIP? THAT'S US. WE SPLIT UP. THERE IS NO NEED FOR ME TO CHECK ON YOU. FAIR ENOUGH. HEY, COOP. FORGETTING SOMETHING? NO. AH, COOP! THE DOG, COOP! THE DOG. COME ON, LUEY. HEY, KENNY. YOU'VE BEEN AT THIS FOR AWHILE. YUP. YOU EVER SEEN THAT BEFORE? NUH-UH. A POLICE DOG DUMB ENOUGH TO EXPOSE HIS SIX WHEN HE SLEEPS? NEVER MIND A POLICE DOG. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANY DOG DO THAT. MAYBE THAT'S HIS PROBLEM. HE DOESN'T KNOW HIS BUTT FROM HIS HEAD. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. IT'S 5:00 SOMEWHERE. HEY, LUEY... WANT TO HELP ME FIND MY MOM? OKAY, LUEY, SMELL THIS! OKAY, COME ON. LET'S FIND MOM. YOU FOUND HER! GOOD DOG, LUEY. COME ON. COME ON. GOOD DOG, LUEY. GOOD DOG. BUT I HAVE TO COME BACK ALONE. THIS'LL SCARE THE BAD GUYS AWAY. "YONDER WAS THE BANKS AND MAYBE A SPARK..." "WHICH WAS A CANDLE IN A CABIN WINDOW. "IT'S LOVELY TO LIVE ON A RAFT. WE HAD THE SKY UP THERE, ALL SPECKLED WITH STARS." "WE'D DISCUSS "THAT WHETHER THE STARS WAS MADE "OR ONLY JUST HAPPENED. "I JUDGED IT WOULD HAVE TOOK TOO LONG "TO MAKE SO MANY. BUT JIM SAID THE MOON COULDA LAID THEM..." "I DIDN'T SAY NOTHING AGAINST IT, "BECAUSE I SEEN A FROG LAY 'MOST AS MANY, SO OF COURSE IT COULD BE DONE." SO CLOSE. AH! SCORE! UM, HEY, JIMMY, I'M GONNA TAKE A BREAK, OKAY? WHAT IS IT? IT'S HIS HARNESS. I GUESS I DIDN'T CHECK IT BEFORE I LEFT LAST NIGHT. YOU MUST NOT HAVE. WELL, IT'S JUST THE DUMB DOG SLEEPS FACING INTO HIS DOGHOUSE. I GUESS I DIDN'T SEE IT. NO ONE COULD GET IN HERE, RIGHT? I MEAN... TAKE A DOG OUT? WHO'D HAVE THE GUTS TO EVEN TRY TO TAKE A DOG FROM THE POLICE KENNEL? AND THEN RETURN HIM? WHY DO THAT? YEAH... I THINK YOU ACCIDENTALLY DROPPED THIS UNDER MY DESK PROTECTOR. WELL, I THOUGHT YOU'D WANT IT NEARBY. COOP, I HAD YOU NEARBY FOR THREE YEARS, AND THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT SO WELL, WHICH IS WHY I CALLED IT OFF. I DON'T NEED THE DAILY REMINDER. HERE'S THE DEAL. I WANT TO START DATING AGAIN, AND IF SOMEONE COMES BY MY OFFICE... YEAH, I GUESS PEOPLE HERE STILL THINK WE'RE TOGETHER. I THINK THEY PRETTY MUCH KNOW WE'RE NOT. WHY? BECAUSE THAT'S THE FIRST THING I TELL THEM. OH. WELL, I FORGET HOW TANNED AND FIT I AM. YOU ARE LIKE A PRAYER ANSWERED. EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE, I GET A TWANG OF IT... NOSTALGIA, UNCERTAINTY... "COULD WE EVER HAVE MADE IT?" WERE YOU LESS OF A BOOB THAN I REMEMBER? THEN, LIKE A PRAYER ANSWERED, YOU SHOW UP. I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING. WHAT IS? YOU'RE NOT AMBIVALENT. THERE'S THE COOPER I KNOW. ALWAYS FINDING THE SILVER LINING. YOU LOOK... GOOD, MOM. I BET ANYTHING YOU'RE GETTING BETTER. EVERYTHING'S FINE. I GOT A JOB. I DECIDED TO WAIT FOR YOU AT HOME, BUT DON'T WORRY... I'M SAFE. IS THIS YOUR MOM, SWEETIE? WE WERE HOPING SOME FAMILY WOULD COME. ARE YOU HERE ALONE? I'M HERE ALONE. BUT I'M STAYING WITH MY GUARDIAN. HE'S A COP, A K-9 COP. OFFICER COOPER-BRAWNS. HONEY, I HAVE A QUESTION, BUT YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW THE ANSWER. DOES HE... THE POLICE OFFICER FRIEND... HAVE POWER OF ATTORNEY FOR YOUR MOM? WHAT KIND OF POWER? I'M SORRY. I MEANT, CAN HE SIGN CONSENT PAPERS FOR HER? NO. OUR PASTOR WAS GONNA BE THAT. BUT THEN MY MOM GOT SICKER BEFORE IT WAS ALL ARRANGED. THINK SHE CAN HEAR ME? MAYBE. SHE'S GETTING LIGHTER. THAT'S WHAT WE CALL IT WHEN THERE ARE SIGNS THAT SHE'S BECOMING MORE CONSCIOUS. I KNOW. THIS HAS HAPPENED BEFORE. IT TAKES HER TWO WEEKS, A MONTH AT THE MOST, TO GET BETTER. HOW LONG'S SHE BEEN SICK? I DON'T TOTALLY KNOW. SHE GOT WORSE THIS YEAR, BUT STILL ISN'T BAD ENOUGH TO GET ON THE LIVER TRANSPLANT LIST. SHE'LL QUALIFY NOW. CAN I DO MY HOMEWORK HERE? I MEAN, UNTIL MY RIDE COMES AT 8:00. STAY AS LONG AS YOU LIKE, HONEY. THANK YOU. THEY SAID SHE WAS BETTER. THEY CALLED IT "LIGHTER." BUT, IF YOU ASK ME... I DON'T THINK SHE LOOKED THAT GOOD. HELLO, POLKA-DOT. HELLO YOURSELF, KENNEL KENNY. WOW... YOU KEEP HIS PEN THIS CLEAN, WE'RE GONNA MAKE YOU JOIN THE UNION. BRAWN NEEDS HIS DOG ON THE FIELD. UH, MAYBE IT'S BETTER IF YOU DON'T GO OUT THERE. HE WASN'T HAPPY LAST TIME. IT'S JUST HE'S PRETTY MUCH KING AROUND HERE, AND YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DISOBEY THE KING. YEAH, BEHEADINGS AND STUFF. PRETTY MUCH. YOU SAID YOU WANTED HIM TO NOT BE AFRAID OF WATER! AND FROM THAT, YOU GOT THAT IT WAS YOUR JOB TO TEACH HIM TO SWIM? YOU JUST GOTTA WHOOP HIM UP MORE. I MEAN, WHY WOULD A DOG GO THROUGH THE WATER IF HE'S NOT WHOOPED UP? "WHOOP HIM UP." DID YOU GET THAT OFF THE INTERNET? CAN YOU EXPLAIN SOMETHING TO ME, COOPER-BRAWNS? I THOUGHT YOU KNEW EVERYTHING ABOUT DOG TRAINING. I DO, BUT THIS ISN'T ABOUT A DOG. WHAT'S A "SIX"? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? YOU KNOW, LIKE, "COVER YOUR SIX"? OH! UH, YOUR BACK. - WHAT? - TURN AROUND. OKAY, YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A GREAT, BIG CLOCK. WHAT'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU? THE KENNEL. NO! WHAT NUMBER ON THE CLOCK? OH! THE 12. OKAY. WHERE AM I? AT THE SIX! "I'VE GOT YOUR SIX." I'M PROTECTING YOUR BACK... LOOKING OUT FOR YOU. THAT'S LIKE WHAT HUCK FINN DID FOR JIM THE SLAVE. HE HAD JIM'S SIX. HUCK FINN? 'COURSE. AND THE WIDOW HAD HUCK'S SIX. SO EVERYBODY WAS COVERED. WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL ABOUT HUCK FINN? AND WHO BESIDES YOU READS HUCK FINN? HE WAS AN ORPHAN AND WASN'T AFRAID OF ANYTHING! HE LIVED ON THAT RIVER, NO ONE WAS IN CHARGE OF HIM, AND HE WAS NEVER CAPTURED! YOU DON'T THINK THAT'S A BIG DEAL? OKAY! CALM DOWN. SORRY I ASKED. NO! DRY OFF LUEY FIRST. GONNA BE A K-9 OFFICER? YOU GOTTA TAKE CARE OF YOUR DOG FIRST. AND HERE, THAT'S FOR YOU. SHOULDN'T YOU BE HOME? IT'S NOT DARK. I GET GROUNDED IF IT'S AFTER DARK. ALL RIGHT. SEE YOU. SEE YA! LOOK, LUEY! I'M NOW OFFICIALLY PART OF THE POLICE K-9 UNIT. GET YOUR NOSE OFF THAT. SHEESH... SMUDGES. JUST WHAT I NEED. I WANT ONE OF THOSE. THE ONE WITH THE FAKE LADYBUGS. FIRST, YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A JOB, THEN YOU'RE BUYING $20 CAKES? ARE YOU JOKING? WHERE WOULD I GET TWO SAWBUCKS? WHAT DO YA THINK? YOU THINK THE BUGS COME LOOKING LIKE THAT? I HAVE TO BRING A CAKE TO SCHOOL TOMORROW. THAT'S HOW THE OTHER KIDS KNOW IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY. HUH! WELL... WEAR A SIGN. DIDN'T YOU COVER THAT BOOK IN, LIKE, THE SIXTH GRADE? YEAH. I DIDN'T GET IT THEN. I DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS THAT GOOD! LOOK. SAM? THERE'S SOMETHING ON MY MIND, SOMETHING I'VE BEEN WANTING TO SAY TO YOU. OKAY. I MISS YOU. THE OTHER DAY, YOU SAID THAT THING ABOUT WANTING TO START DATING OTHER PEOPLE AGAIN? - YEAH? - UGH! NO. I THINK THAT... I'M ASKING... I HAVE A PLAN, AND I JUST WANT YOU TO GIVE IT SOME THOUGHT. OKAY. SO WHAT'S YOUR PLAN? US. I WANT TO GIVE US ANOTHER TRY. HERE'S THE THING. WE LOVED EACH OTHER. THAT'S FOR CERTAIN. AND I THINK WE STILL MIGHT. AT LEAST, I KNOW I DO. LOOK, PEOPLE BREAK UP BECAUSE THEY FALL OUT OF LOVE! THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN WITH US. IT DIDN'T. I JUST... AND I KNOW ONE THING FOR SURE. I DON'T WANT TO BE WITH ANYBODY ELSE. SO... SO IT DIDN'T WORK. OKAY. I THINK IT CAN WORK THIS TIME. AND WHY DIDN'T IT WORK BEFORE? WELL... BECAUSE I... I DON'T KNOW, I THINK I WAS TOO... AH, WHAT'S THE WORD FOR IT? I WAS TOO FOCUSED ON... PLAYTIME? YEAH. YEAH! PROBABLY. BUT THAT'S THE THING. I'VE CHANGED. HOW HAVE YOU CHANGED, COOP? BE SPECIFIC. HOW? WELL... COOP... I'M LEAVING. OH. OKAY, I'LL GET THE CHECK. COOP! LEAVING, AS IN TRANSFERRING. I'M NOT GONNA LIVE HERE ANYMORE. I'M GONNA WORK AT ONE OF THE BASE STATIONS IN THE VALLEY. OH... OKAY. THAT'S OKAY! WELL, THAT'S FINE, SAMMY. WE'LL STILL SEE EACH OTHER. NO, WE WILL RUN INTO EACH OTHER, TRUST ME. IT'S OKAY. WANNA COME TO A PARTY? GOOD OLD PHIL GAVE ME A PIECE OF CAKE! ♪ HAPPY... WE'LL SKIP THE SONG, I'LL JUST MAKE A WISH AND THEN WE CAN EAT. I WISHED THAT THEY DON'T CAPTURE ME BEFORE MY MOM GETS BETTER. THEY HAVE SOME NOT-SO-NICE PLACES FOR KIDS IN MY SITUATION. OH! AND I ALSO WISHED THAT COOPER-BRAWNS DOESN'T FIND OUT THAT YOU CAME TO MY PARTY. "FRANCES... "WE CAME BY TO SEE HOW YOU'RE FEELING. "WE'LL COME BACK SOON. PASTOR JOHN AND RUTH" OH, PENELOPE! UH, RUTH, IT'S THE DAUGHT CHILD! WE GOT YOUR NOTE. I THOUGHT I'D DROP BY HERE, SAVE YOU THE TRIP. GOOD, GOOD. BUT WE WANTED TO LOOK IN ON YOUR MOM. OH, SHE'S IN EXCELLENT SPIRITS THESE DAYS. BUT I HAD A QUESTION. SURE, WHAT IS IT? IT'S ABOUT PRAYING. COME IN. SO... SAY YOU PRAY FOR SOMETHING YOU WANT. HOW THOROUGH... LIKE, COMPLETE... DO YOU NEED TO BE? I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND. SAY YOU WANT TO GO FISHING AND YOU PRAY FOR A FISHING ROD. DO YOU NEED TO PRAY FOR THE HOOKS SEPARATELY? OR WILL YOU AUTOMATICALLY GET THEM WITH THE ROD? DO YOU WANT TO GO FISHING, DEAR? NO. IT'S A "SUPPOSE" SORT OF QUESTION. I ASKED MY MOM. SHE DIDN'T KNOW, AND SHE... WE... FIGURED YOU WOULD KNOW, BEING THAT YOU'RE THE PREACHER. AH. MY DEAR, GOD KNOWS WHAT YOU NEED EVEN BEFORE YOU ASK. IF HE WANTS YOU TO CATCH A REALLY BIG FISH, HE'LL PROVIDE A REALLY BIG HOOK. IF I HELP YOU, YOU CAN'T TELL ANYONE. I KNOW. YOU CAN'T EVEN TELL THEM WE WERE TOGETHER. WHATEVER. OKAY. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? SAY A CIVILIAN WORKS 40 HOURS A WEEK AND CAN WASH FIVE DOGS AN HOUR. HOW MUCH IS THAT PER HOUR, AND HOW MUCH IS THAT PER DOG? FIRST, WE NEED TO KNOW THE CIVILIAN'S PAY. LIKE, DOES HE MAKE MINIMUM WAGE? OR IS HE IN A UNION? THEY USUALLY MAKE MORE THAN MINIMUM. WHAT'S A UNION? 'CAUSE ONE OF MY FELLOW OFFICERS TOLD ME I SHOULD JOIN ONE. WE NEED TO RENEGOTIATE MY SALARY. WHAT? I SPOKE TO AN EXPERT. I NEED $7.00 AN HOUR. MINIMUM. RIGHT NOW, I GET FIVE. RIGHT NOW, YOU DON'T GET A WAGE, YOU GET A GIFT, WHICH IS FROM ME, PERSONALLY, OUT OF THE GOODNESS OF MY HEART. AND IT WOULD BE OVERPAYMENT IF IT WERE PAY. BUT IT'S NOT, BECAUSE YOU WERE NEVER HIRED, BECAUSE THERE'S SOMEBODY ELSE WHO ALREADY GETS PAID TO DO WHAT YOU THINK YOU WERE HIRED TO DO! LUEY'S HAPPIER CLEAN, AND A HAPPY DOG IS A HARD-WORKING DOG. AND A HARD-WORKING DOG CAN SMELL AN OUTLAW A MILE AWAY. FIVE MILES AWAY. THAT'S NOT THE POINT. IF LUEY STINKS, LIKE HE DID WHEN I MET HIM, HE'S GOING TO BE DISTRACTED BY HIS OWN ODOR AND MAKE MISTAKES. ALL THAT TO SAVE $2.00? WHOA! WHAT'S UP WITH THE STARE-DOWN? SHE WANTS A RAISE. "COPS FOR KIDS" DOESN'T MEAN SLAVE LABOR. THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS COPS FOR KIDS! YOU INVENTED IT, REMEMBER? DANG. REALLY, DUDE? WOW. HOW MUCH DID SHE GET OUT OF YOU? SHE WANTED SEVEN, BUT I GOT HER DOWN TO SIX. IT WAS WORTH SEVEN. SHE WORKS FOR ME. MM-MM. NO, SHE DOESN'T! SHE SAID SHE WOULDN'T WORK FOR A SLAVE OWNER! SORRY. THEY PUT BROCCOLI ON IT TONIGHT. I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE BROCCOLI, BUT I GOT YOU AN EXTRA ICE CREAM. THANK YOU. HOW WERE MY MOM'S LABS TODAY? THEY'VE HAVEN'T CHANGED MUCH, SWEETIE. THAT'S OKAY. THEY WILL SOON. THAT'S HOW THIS GOES. EAT BEFORE YOUR RIDE COMES. WHEN DO YOU GET A DAY OFF? THURSDAY. BUT I'M BUSY. I WASN'T ASKING ABOUT YOU. I FIGURED IF YOU GOT A DAY OFF, SO DID LUEY. I WAS THINKING ABOUT SHOW-AND-TELL, AT MY SCHOOL. THERE'S A SOUTH SWELL COMING IN. SHOWING-AND-TELLING AT YOUR SCHOOL IS THE LAST THING I WANT TO DO. YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME. I CAN TAKE HIM. AH, THE DEPARTMENT WOULD NEVER GO FOR IT. THEY WOULDN'T APPROVE OF A DOG DEMONSTRATION? I STILL HAVE TO DROP HIM OFF. SO? YOU'RE TRYING TO COME UP WITH REASONS TO SAY NO. WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT? THAT'S HOW GUYS LIKE YOU ARE. YOU KNOW A LOT ABOUT GUYS LIKE ME? I KNOW MY MOM WAS SMART ENOUGH TO DIVORCE ONE. THIS IS YOU ASKING FOR A FAVOR? THEY'LL JUST FEED HIM A BUNCH OF LICORICE OR DING-DONGS... WHATEVER IT IS YOU GUYS EAT THESE DAYS, A BUNCH OF HOKUM. WE NEVER EAT HOKUM. WELL? IT'S AGAINST THE RULES. YOU ALWAYS SAY HE'S FAT AND STUPID. THIS IS A CHANCE FOR HIM TO SOCIALIZE AND EXERCISE, ALL WHILE YOU'RE RIDING THAT SOUTH SWELL. OH, HEY. YOU ANY GOOD WITH KNOTS? COOPER... I THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT YOU ASKED. ABOUT HAVING ANOTHER TRY? AND... THE ANSWER'S NO. I'M LEAVING. TRANSFERRING. MOVING FAR AWAY. WHY? BECAUSE IT'S TOO HARD! SEEING YOU. BUT I DON'T UNDERST... COOPER. YOU ARE A GREAT GUY. THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS THAT I LOVE ABOUT YOU. YOUR SUN IS ALWAYS OUT, AND... THAT'S A GOOD THING. BUT? YOU KNOW THE OTHER DAY, WHEN THOSE THREE LITTLE ONES WERE SITTING ON THE BENCH... AND YOU ASKED ME HOW I DO IT? I CAN'T DO IT ALONE. MY PLAN WAS TO LEAN ON YOU, BECAUSE... THAT'S WHAT COUPLES DO WHEN THINGS GET DARK. AND I WANTED TO BE THERE FOR YOU, TOO, BUT... YOUR LIFE NEVER SEEMS TO GETS SERIOUS ENOUGH FOR YOU TO NEED ME. WE FELL IN LOVE AND WE GOT ENGAGED, AND I THOUGHT WE'D GROW OLD TOGETHER... BUT INSTEAD, WE GREW APART. I'VE GIVEN TWO WEEKS' NOTICE, COOP. I HAVE TO GO. SAM. COME ON. LET'S... COOPER. THE OTHER DAY, YOU SAID THAT YOU STILL LOVED ME. IF THAT'S TRUE, EVEN JUST A LITTLE... YOU WON'T ASK ME NOT TO. THEN I WON'T ASK YOU NOT TO. I'LL HAVE HIM BACK IN HIS PEN BY DARK. RIGHT AFTER SCHOOL. ROGER THAT. HAVE FUN! I WILL. COME ON, LUEY! OKAY, I NEED YOU ALL TO GO OUT. AND YOU NEED TO LEAVE, TOO. I NEED TO PREPARE MY PRESENTATION ALONE. SMELL THIS, LUEY. OKAY, YOU CAN ALL COME BACK IN NOW! BLOODHOUNDS ARE DIFFERENT THAN MOST OTHER DOGS. THEY'RE DESIGNED TO TRACK CELLS THAT FALL OFF HUMANS AND LEAVE A SCENT BEHIND. THAT'S WHERE I COME IN. I LOOK AFTER HIM, BATHE HIM, AND HELP WITH SENSITIVE TRAINING. EWW! AND THAT'S ANOTHER THING. BLOODHOUNDS DROOL MORE THAN MOST OTHER DOGS. OH, AND THEY CAN'T EAT ANY HOKUM. WHAT'S "HOKUM"? IT'S KIND OF LIKE FOOD FROM OTHER COUNTRIES, I THINK. HOW'D YOU GET TO DO THAT JOB? I HAVE A BOSS ON THE FORCE. OFFICER COOPER-BRAWNS. HE HIRED ME. HOW CAN OTHER PEOPLE GET A JOB WITH THE FORCE? YEAH, I WANT TO DO THAT, TOO! YOU HAVE TO BE SPECIALLY QUALIFIED. BUT WE'RE CUTTING INTO MY DEMONSTRATION TIME. THIS HARNESS TELLS HIM THAT PLAYTIME IS OVER, IT'S TIME FOR WORK. OKAY, LUEY. I NEED YOU TO FIND TIFFANY'S BACKPACK. THAT'S TIFFANY. T-I-F-F-A-N-Y. GO FIND. NO WAY! SHE TAUGHT LUEY TO READ! FAUSS, LUEY! FAUSS! THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS NOT TO LET THE MASCARA CLUMP TOGETHER. HEY! WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO, LITTLE LADY? HI, KENNEL KENNY. I'M TAKING LUEY ON A "RIKE." A... A WHAT? LUEY RUNS AND PULLS ME ALONG ON MY BIKE. SEE YA. GOODBYE. SO RICH! I GOT SO MUCH CAKE, IT WAS AWESOME. I'M TALKING, LIKE, BLACK FOREST CAKE. JUST A SECOND, I'VE JUST GOT TO... HEY! WHERE'S LUEY? OH, POLKA-DOT TOOK HIM OUT ON A RIKE. IT'S REALLY CUTE... I DON'T... I DON'T WANT TO KNOW, KENNY. I HAVE SOMETHING ELSE TO TELL YOU YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO KNOW. I'M PRETTY SURE SHE'S BEEN TAKING HIM HOME AT NIGHT. RETURNS HIM IN THE MORNING, BEFORE I GET IN. IF THE CAPTAIN FOUND OUT, HE'D PUT ME ON A PERMANENT UNPAYCATION. I MEAN, IS IT WORTH THE HEADACHE? HOW'S LUEY PERFORMING? HE'S GOT MORE GIDDY-UP THAN EVER. BUT HE'S NOT SLEEPING HERE. I MEAN, THAT'S A... THAT'S A BIG LIABILITY. WELL... AFTER HE FINDS A KID THAT'S GONE MISSING, ASK THE PARENTS IF THEY CARE WHERE THE SEARCH DOG SPENT THE NIGHT. AHH... LET'S LET SLEEPING DOGS LIE, KENNY. REALLY, COOP. "SLEEPING DOGS LIE?" EVERYTHING'S GOING REALLY GOOD, MOM. I DID THIS MAJOR THING AT SCHOOL FOR EARTH SCIENCE. EVERYONE IN THE CLASS TOTALLY CHEERED AT THE END. YOU WOULD'VE LOVED IT. ♪ FROM THIS VALLEY ♪ THEY SAY YOU ARE GOING ♪♪ WHAT IS IT, LUEY? POLKA-DOT? POLKA-DOT? EVERYTHING'S FINE, MOM. YOU TAUGHT ME EVERYTHING I'D NEED TO KNOW TO NAVIGATE MY OWN RIVER. GO TO SCHOOL, EAT GOOD, BED EARLY, NOT BE SCARED. I EVEN SAID MY PRAYERS, JUST LIKE YOU'D WANT ME TO. FEEL MY SMILE. I CAN FEEL IT, HONEY. I CAN FEEL YOUR SMILE. I LOVE YOU, MOM. I LOVE YOU, TOO. BUT, LUEY, I'M ALSO WORRIED, WHAT IF MY MOM DOESN'T COME BACK? COMING TO GET YOU, LUEY! TIME TO WORK. IS THE SUSPECT ARMED? YEAH, ROGER THAT, COOP. HE HAD A HAND-GUN. ALL RIGHT. COME ON, LUEY. LET'S GET YOUR GAME FACE ON. COME ON, GRIZZ. LOAD UP. LOAD UP HERE. LOAD UP. QUIET, LUEY. SIT TIGHT. WHAT DO WE GOT? WHITE MALE. MID-20s. WHEN THE GAS STATION ATTENDANT WAS TOO SLOW GIVING UP THE CASH, HE KNOCKED HIM OVER THE HEAD, DROPPED HIM COLD. DROP ANYTHING... HAT, WALLET, GLOVE? YEAH. CIGARETTE, HE TOUCHED IT. HE'S GOT ABOUT A 10-MINUTE JUMP ON US. PATROL'S GOT TWO GUYS READY TO WATCH. ALL RIGHT. GOOD. LET'S ROLL. LET LUEY TAKE THE LEAD. MAYBE HE CAN SNIFF HIM OUT, WE CAN AVOID A BITE. THAT'S A GOOD CALL. COME ON, LUEY. COME ON. COME ON. LET'S GO. COME ON. I'M GONNA SEND GRIZZLY IN. NO. NO, WAIT. WE KNOW YOU'RE ARMED! COME OUT, HANDS FIRST! DO IT NOW! LET ME GIVE THE COMMAND. YOU GOT THREE SECONDS, OR WE'RE SENDING IN THE DOG! ONE... TWO... GO BACK TO THE CRIME SCENE. PICK UP THE RIGHT TRAIL. WOOF! ROGER THAT. I'M SORRY. I'M TAKING YOU HOME. COME ON! - THIS ONE? - YEAH. ON THE LEFT? THANK YOU FOR THE RIDE. GO GET YOUR MOM. WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THIS. NO, WE DON'T. GO GET YOUR MOM. BUT SHE'S ASLEEP. WAKE HER UP. I CAN'T. SHE'S SICK. REAL SICK. OH, REALLY? SICK? SICK HOW? SHE HAS LIVER DISEASE. LIVER DISEASE? WHAT KIND OF LIVER DISEASE? PRIMARY BILIARY CIRRHOSIS. I DON'T BELIEVE YOU. WAKE HER UP ANYWAY. SHE'S NOT HOME. WHAT, HER BILELARRY... BILILARY, WHATEVER... GOT BETTER? NO. I LIED. SHE'S NOT SICK. SHE'S OUT. SHE DOES THAT SOMETIMES, AND SHE STAYS OUT VERY LATE. AND LEAVES YOU ALL ALONE? NOT ALL NIGHT! AND BESIDES, I'M OLD ENOUGH TO BABY-SIT. REMEMBER? OPEN UP, MA'AM. POLICE. WHAT'S HER NAME? FRANCES. OPEN UP, FRANCES. IT'S THE POLICE. FRANCES? OKAY. YOU GO IN THERE. LOCK THE DOOR AND GO TO BED, OKAY? I'LL BE BACK TOMORROW, AND TELL HER TO BE HERE. THANK YOU. HEY, LUEY. DON'T YOU DARE. COME HERE. SIT DOWN. THAT'S A PINK SLIP. IN CASE YOU'VE NEVER SEEN ONE, THAT'S HOW YOU FIND OUT YOUR JOB'S LETTING YOU GO. LEAVE THE STUFF THAT WAS HERE WHEN YOU CAME, TAKE WHATEVER'S YOURS WITH YOU. YOU CAN'T DO THAT. OH, SURE, I CAN. I NEED THE MONEY! 11-YEAR-OLDS DON'T NEED MONEY, BECAUSE THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING OF VALUE. WASHING A DOG IS VALUE. AND I'M 12 NOW. NOT WHEN IT CAUSES THIS MUCH HEADACHE. THERE'S A REASON THEY'RE CALLED "ACCIDENTS," AND NOT "ON-PURPOSES." I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE GOING TO A CRIME SCENE. DON'T MOVE AN INCH. LAST NIGHT, WE WERE A HEARTBEAT AWAY FROM SENDING IN THE ATTACK DOG. THOSE ARE BITES. THAT WHITE STUFF IS BONE. THAT COULD HAVE BEEN YOUR ARMS AND LEGS. I DID THAT. THAT WAS MY DOG. I SENT HIM IN. BUT I CAN LIVE WITH IT, BECAUSE THAT WAS AN ARMED SUSPECT, AND THAT'S MY JOB. LAST NIGHT? THAT COULD HAVE BEEN YOU. I WAS WRONG FOR CREATING THIS MESS AND FOR LETTING YOU THINK THIS PLACE WAS A PLAYGROUND. BUT THE "COPS FOR KIDS" PROGRAM... THEY WON'T BE HAPPY WHEN THEY FIND OUT... THERE IS NO COPS FOR KIDS. YOU MADE IT UP. IT'S NOT REAL. IT'S YOUR TALL TALE, JUST LIKE MARK TWAIN MADE UP HUCK FINN. HUCK FINN IS A STORY BY SAMUEL CLEMENS, WHO CALLED HIMSELF MARK TWAIN, AND MARK TWAIN BELIEVED IN HUCK FINN. AND ALL THAT STUFF THAT HAPPENED ON THE MISSISSIPPI... IT COULD'VE HAPPENED! FROM NOW ON, YOU'RE OFF THE JUNK FOOD. IT'S OKAY, COOP. I WASN'T DOING ANYTHING. WILL YOU BELIEVE THAT I GOT CONNED BY A KID? WHAT? SHE'S 11! 11? ACTUALLY, I GUESS SHE JUST TURNED 12, BUT SHE'S CAUSED ME NOTHING BUT GRIEF, AND NOW TO MAKE THINGS WORSE, LUEY WON'T EAT. WHO'S THE KID? UH, SHE WORKED FOR ME. SHE'S PART OF THE "COPS FOR KIDS" PROGRAM. WE DON'T HAVE A "COPS FOR KIDS" PROGRAM. I KNOW. SHE INVENTED IT. SHE HID IN MY TRUCK LAST NIGHT ON A CALL, AND THANKS TO "LOONY," WHO TRACKED HER INSTEAD OF A SUSPECT, SHE ALMOST GOT MAULED! OKAY, TIME OUT. YOU HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF HOLES TO FILL IN. SO LET'S START WITH... DID YOU GET A WAIVER FROM HER PARENTS FOR HER TO WORK WITH YOU? I'VE SEEN THAT STUPID "OOPS, I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT" LOOK BEFORE. SO... WHAT DID HER PARENTS SAY WHEN YOU DROPPED HER OFF? AND THERE'S THAT LOOK AGAIN. WELL, THE MOM'S DIVORCED, AND SHE WASN'T HOME. LET'S CALL HER. I DON'T HAVE A NUMBER. OKAY. WELL, GIVE ME HER NAME. FRANCES IS THE MOM. - MM-HMM? - POLKA-DOT'S THE KID. THAT'S POLKA-DOT? OKAY, WELL, FRANCES WHAT? POLKA-DOT WHAT? UM... AN ADDRESS? DIDN'T WRITE IT DOWN. BUT I KNOW WHERE IT IS, BECAUSE I DROPPED HER OFF. YOU LET HER GO IN? YOU DIDN'T MEET THE MOM, AND YOU DROVE AWAY? YOU HAVE A 12-YEAR-OLD WHO WORKS FOR YOU, SHE STAYS OUT AT NIGHT, AND YOU'VE NEVER HEARD FROM ANY PARENTS, BUT THAT DOESN'T STRIKE YOU AS ODD? YOU-YOU DO REALIZE THE MOST KIDS HAVE A CURFEW, RIGHT? I MEAN, WHAT IS IT YOU DO FOR A LIVING? ALL SHE WAS DOING WAS WASHING THE STUPID DOG FOR BUBBLEGUM MONEY. WHERE DID YOU MEET HER? AT THE DINER. SHE WAS LOOKING FOR A JOB. SHE WAS LOOKING FOR A JOB AND SHE'S 12? HEY! I KNOW WHERE SHE GOES TO SCHOOL. SHE ASKED ME TO DO THIS, UH, UM, TALK, A SHOW-AND-TELL. SO DID YOU? PFFT. REALLY? SAMANTHA McCUTCHEN. YEAH, HE'S RIGHT HERE. YOUR OFFICE IS TRANSFERRING A CALL FROM MEMORIAL HOSPITAL. IT'S URGENT. YEAH. BRAWN. HER LABS WERE GETTING BETTER... HEADING THE RIGHT DIRECTION. SHE WAS BECOMING MORE RESPONSIVE. BUT THEN HER VITAL SIGNS DETERIORATED QUICKLY. PEOPLE WITH LIVER DISEASE THIS... THIS ADVANCED DON'T HAVE MUCH RESERVE. SHE WENT BACK INTO A DEEP COMA, STOPPED BREATHING AT 12:02. SHE'S DEAD? DOESN'T SHE HAVE A NEXT-OF-KIN LISTED? NO. DOES POLKA-DOT KNOW? NO. WE WANTED AN ADULT, SOMEONE CLOSE TO HER, TO TELL HER, AND BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN DROPPING HER OFF FOR THE LAST TWO WEEKS, WE FIGURED... WHAT? YOU'RE HER GUARDIAN, RIGHT? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? YOU'RE K-9 OFFICER BRAWNS? "BRAWN." YEAH. YOU'RE LUEY'S HANDLER? WAIT. YOU KNOW LUEY? LUEY COMES WITH HER SOMETIMES. HOW OFTEN? SHE COMES EVERY DAY, AND LUEY USUALLY COMES WITH HER. SHE STAYS UNTIL YOU PICK HER UP. OKAY, LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. SO POLKA-DOT COMES HERE... EVERY DAY. SHE TOLD THE STAFF THAT SHE'S STAYING WITH OFFICER BRAWN, AND HE GIVES HER A RIDE HOME? YEAH. WITH HIM. I DON'T MEAN TO SOUND ACCUSATORY, BUT... BUT HOW COME NOBODY VERIFIED HER STORY? DON'T ANSWER THAT. I DIDN'T EITHER. DO YOU WANT TO BRING HER TO SEE HER MOM BEFORE WE MOVE HER? WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME POLKA-DOT SAW HER? LAST NIGHT. BUT IT WAS LATER THAN USUAL. MAYBE SHE SENSED THIS WAS COMING. WHY DO YOU SAY THAT? SHE WAS KIND OF... WELL, DOWN. DID HER MOM KNOW SHE WAS HERE? I DON'T THINK SO. BUT SHE COMBED HER MOM'S HAIR AND DID HER MAKE-UP. NO. NO. I'M NOT BRINGING HER DOWN HERE. SHE SHOULD REMEMBER HER JUST LIKE THAT. THANK YOU. I'LL DO THIS. I'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE. I'VE DONE THIS BEFORE. NO, SAM. THANK YOU. I HAVE TO DO THIS ALONE. SHE CAN'T HEAR IT FROM A STRANGER. NO, COOP, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS IS LIKE. - I'VE SEEN THIS... - NO! YOU HAVEN'T. I'VE BEEN A COP FOR 15 YEARS. - NO, TRUST ME. - I'VE DONE PLENTY OF... - NOT LIKE THIS ONE. - NOTIFICATIONS LIKE THIS. SAM, I WOULD LIKE NOTHING BETTER THAN TO LET YOU DO THIS FOR ME. REALLY, BUT I... THIS IS MY RESPONSIBILITY. I DIDN'T SEE IT. I JUST DIDN'T SEE IT. OKAY. I'LL GO PICK HER UP AND I'LL TAKE HER DOWN TO THE STATION AND I'LL TELL HER THERE. NO. IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY. SHE KNOWS THE MOMENT SHE SEES YOUR EYES WHAT'S COMING. SO... YOU GOTTA SAY IT THEN AND SAY IT STRAIGHT. NO MINCING. SHE'S ALREADY BEEN THROUGH ENOUGH, AND THAT JUST... IT PROLONGS THE AGONY. SO WHEN SHE GOES INTO DENIAL, WHICH SHE WILL, RESTATE IT. RESTATE IT UNTIL SHE BELIEVES YOU. OKAY. COOP. I'M COMING WITH YOU. I DON'T THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. SHE DOESN'T KNOW YOU. I'M NOT GOING FOR HER. YOU'LL KNOW WHAT TO DO. AH. POLKA-DOT? IT'S ME. ANSWER THE DOOR. POLKA-DOT, OPEN UP! I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE! ANSWER THE DOOR. COME ON, ANSWER THE DOOR. COME ON. OPEN UP. I'M COMIN' IN, EITHER WAY! STOP RIGHT THERE. DON'T MAKE ME SHOOT. DON'T SHOOT! I'M A POLICE OFFICER! STOP RIGHT THERE. DON'T MAKE ME SHOOT. POLKA-DOT? POLKA-DOT! I'M JUST GONNA HAVE A SEAT... BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE HERE. I'M NOT LEAVING. HOWEVER LONG IT TAKES FOR YOU TO COME OUT, I'LL STILL BE HERE. HI. I TOLD MY MOM YOU WANT TO TALK TO HER. SHE'LL BE BACK LATER TODAY. SHE'S OUT... POLKA-DOT... STOP. SIT DOWN. AM I CAUGHT? SIT. PLEASE. I KNOW WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON. THEN YOU KNOW THAT SHE'S AT MEMORIAL? SHE'S NOT AT MEMORIAL ANYMORE. POLKA-DOT... I NEED YOU TO LOOK AT ME. SHE'S GONE. SHE'S GONE TO A... BETTER PLACE. I'M SUPPOSED TO GO TO THE PREACHER'S. I MEAN... THE PASTOR. THAT'S WHAT MY MOM SAID. SO IT'S ALL SET. YOU CAN RIDE ME THERE, JUST LET ME GET MY STUFF. OH, AND I SHOULD STILL GO TO SCHOOL. I KNOW! YOU CAN KEEP ME! IT'S LIKE HUCK. THE WIDOW TOOK HIM IN. EVEN WHEN MISS WATSON DIDN'T WANT HER TO, SHE STILL DID IT! WE DON'T HAVE TO BE CIVILIZED OR ANYTHING. I COULD DO STUFF FOR YOU THAT YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO, LIKE PAY YOUR BILLS ONLINE! POLKA-DOT, STOP! NO, I'M... LOOK, I'M SORRY. THAT WOULD NEVER WORK. I'M NOT... I'M NOT SET UP FOR THAT. "SOME DAY, I'LL LIE DOWN AND FORGET IT ALL! AND MY POOR BROKEN HEART WILL BE AT REST..." "FOR WHO FETCHED ME SO LOW WHEN I WAS SO HIGH? I DID MYSELF." POLKA-DOT, STOP IT. "LET THE COLD WORLD DO ITS WORST. "ONE THING I KNOW... THERE'S A GRAVE SOMEWHERE FOR ME." POLKA-DOT, IT'S GONNA BE... "THE WORLD MAY GO ON "JUST AS IT'S ALWAYS DONE, "AND TAKE EVERYTHING FROM ME... BUT IT CAN'T TAKE THAT." "SOME DAY, I'LL LIE DOWN IN IT AND FORGET IT ALL, AND MY POOR, BROKEN HEART WILL BE AT REST." HANG ON. COME ON. COME ON, LET'S GO IN. COME ON. YOUR MOM? COME ON IN. THANK YOU. UH, I'M ACTUALLY JUST AN ACQUAINTANCE OF... WELL, SAMANTHA HERE IS WITH CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES. IF YOU'RE WILLING, THIS IS THE BEST OPTION FOR NOW. WE CAN RE-EVALUATE LATER, AND SEE IF IT'S FEASIBLE FOR EVERYONE. EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT. WE'LL FIGURE THIS THING OUT TOGETHER. YOU'LL TEACH US A FEW THINGS TOO, I BET. WE CAN DO SOME BAKING. UM, I'LL, UH... MAKE ARRANGEMENTS FOR A FUNERAL SERVICE. SOMETHING SIMPLE. OKAY. WOULD YOU, UH, WOULD YOU LET ME KNOW? OF COURSE. SHE'S IN A SAFE PLACE, COOP. THERE'S NOT A LOT OF OPTIONS... WHEN THERE'S NO DAD IN THE PICTURE AND NO RELATIVES. BELIEVE ME. THIS... IS THE BEST ONE. HOW DO THEY DO? YOU KNOW, IN THE LONG RUN? SOME DO FINE... AND... SOME DON'T. TELL ME ABOUT THE ONES THAT DON'T. YOU ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THEM. AND THOSE ARE THE DESPERATE ONES... YOU'VE BEEN DEALING WITH THEM YOUR WHOLE CAREER. HOW DO YOU NOT BRING 'EM ALL HOME? YOU NEVER ONCE... ASKED ME THAT WHEN WE WERE TOGETHER. I'M SORRY... FOR THAT. IT BREAKS YOUR HEART, DOESN'T IT? YOU'D BRING 'EM ALL HOME IF YOU COULD, WOULDN'T YOU? FOR YEARS, I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR JUST... FOR JUST A HINT OF HUMANITY IN THAT WATERLOGGED SOUL. SO TELL ME ONE THING. WHY NOW? WHY NOT WHEN WE WERE TOGETHER? I... WISH I KNEW. THANKS. AND THEN I'LL SAY SOMETHING SIMPLE. SOMETHING TO CELEBRATE THE LIFE OF... UH, "POLKA-DOT." LIKE WHAT? LIKE WHAT WILL YOU SAY? WELL, SOMETHING LIKE, "LORD, AS YOU WELCOME FRANCES "INTO YOUR LOVING ARMS, "WASH AWAY OUR PAIN AND OUR ANGUISH AND RESTORE AGAIN THE JOY IN OUR SOULS." "JOY"? AND THEN WE COULD, UH... HAVE SEVERAL SELECTIONS FROM THE ORGANIST. YOU KNOW, I, UH... I DON'T WANT TO OFFEND ANYBODY, BUT I'M... I'D LIKE TO MAKE THE ARRANGEMENTS MYSELF. I'VE GOT, UH, SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT IN MIND. I'M SURE IT WILL BE LOVELY. "DO NOT SPILL YOUR TEARS INTO THE WATER. INSTEAD, TURN, FACE THE WIND..." "FOR I WILL BE THERE, AND I WILL WIPE THEM DRY." "AND LIKE THE WAVES THAT BLANKET THE SHORE, "MY LOVE WILL REMAIN WITH YOU... "FAMILIAR, "ENDURING, "AND INFINITE. IT IS ALL THESE THINGS, BUT IT IS NEVER ABSENT." I LOVE YOU, MOM. "NEVER ABSENT." GOD, WATCH OVER THIS LITTLE GIRL AND BLESS THE MEMORY OF HER MOM. ♪ THOUGH I MAY NOT BE AROUND ♪ ♪ KNOW THAT I'LL BE LOOKIN' DOWN ♪ ♪ TO KEEP YOU SAFE TO KEEP YOU SOUND ♪ ♪ BUT YOU'RE NOT LOST YOU'RE FOUND ♪ ♪ AHH... ♪ YOU ARE FOUND ♪ COOPER-BRAWNS? YEP? MY MOM... I BET SHE REALLY LIKED HER FUNERAL. AWW, I'M SURE SHE DID. HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT I DID LAST WEEK? UM... I DON'T KNOW. I READ "HUCK FINN." DID YOU LIKE IT? I LOVED IT! IT WAS KINDA SAD. LIKE HOW? WELL, YOU KNOW HOW HUCK'S A LITTLE KID, BUT HE STILL FEELS SO RESPONSIBLE FOR JIM THE SLAVE. YOU KNOW, IT JUST... KINDA MADE ME SAD. WHY? WELL, YOU KNOW, EVEN THOUGH LIFE DEALT HUCK A PRETTY ROUGH HAND... I THINK HE STILL JUST WANTED TO BE A KID, YOU KNOW? THE KIND THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY WORRIES. AND IT MADE ME SAD THAT HE MIGHT'VE FELT GUILTY JUST FOR WANTING THAT. BUT... IT ENDED HAPPY. 'CAUSE, HUCK, FOUND OUT THERE WAS SOMEBODY HE COULD LEAN ON. HE FOUND OUT THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE DO WHEN IT GETS DARK. WHAT'S THE MATTER? YOU'RE GONNA KEEP ME, AREN'T YOU, COOPER-BRAWNS? I GOT YOUR SIX. WILL YOU KEEP ME? I WILL. - BE HERE AT 3:00. - 3:00 IT IS!
