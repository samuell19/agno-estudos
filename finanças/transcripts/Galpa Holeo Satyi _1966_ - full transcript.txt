Hey elder lad. Hey elder lad. Papa did you call me? Come inside. - Tell me what you want? l am in a towel. Get that chawanprash and a glass of water. lt has started. My office going today is doomed. Hey middle lad. Why are you calling me? - Give papa chawanprash and a glass of water. Ok. You come of the bathroom fast or l'll late to school. lf you are late why did you not get up early? Am l lazing around from the morning? l went to the market.. ..and made other arrangements. My school master job has.. ..become secondary. Primary job is the household chores. This is like communism. One keeps working relentlessly. The recognition will come very late. Hey youngest lad. What do you want? Go and give papa chawanprash and water. Hey lad. The youngest lad is calling you. Why are you not responding? l don't like talking to non-intellectual persons like these. Hey son. What do you want? ''Give papa, not your papa but my papa..'' ..l mean your grandpa. Give him chawanprash and a glass of water. Everybody is the same. Will have blame grandpa for this. Go and give chawanprash and water to grandpa. Grandpa needs water and chawanprash. - Why/ What is the last bride ding? l have not seen her from the morning. Here l am tired of cooking. Hey last bride. Don't shout so that whole street can hear. l am near you. That l know that you are at the tip of nose. What is the royal woman doing from the morning? l am bathing your prince. l have a lot to responsibilities in this huge royal family. The retort is ready on your lips. One just needs to just tip it of. Since morning you are busy looking after your husband and son only. Father needs chawanprash and water. Can't you move your ass and give it. No l can't move it. You have given me ten slaves. Would it not hurt the honour.. ..of this royal family if l work. Go and take this towel also. Form the morning l am seeing you stirring that. Can't you go and give papa that chawanprash? Are you deaf. - Why do you pick up water from the pot? Go and take it from the tap. Who will fill up that pot? You? Here l am dying doing all these work Why are you scolding the maid? How much are you paying her for all this? Who pays whom in this house? Tell her some work and she puts up a face. When she asks to be paid for the work do you smile and pay? Did you hear that? As if money is hanging out on a tree. l know that money does not hang out on a tree. Don't teach me. First tell me why you chased out that servant yesterday? l can't do all these work all alone. Either hire another person or release me. Don't threaten us like this everyday. ls there dearth of maids in this city? Don't abuse us madam. We are also human like you. We also have blood.. ..flowing inside us like you. We won't take this anymore. Where did you learn all this? - Why? Don't we have an assassin? Assassin? - She means association. You have also formed an association? ls it leftist or rightist? ''Hey, is it leftist or rightist?'' Don't talk to me in that super language. Talk straight. Your leader. ls he leftist or rightist? l don't know all that. Form now you have give one an half days off.. ..every week. Saturday half and Sunday full. lf you abuse us we will also retort. Stop it? Enough. A bunch of opportunists The country's future is doomed. Couldn't find a better place to from unions. Just don't brush it aside brother. Explain it so that it is understood. Stop your sarcasism. That is why l don't talk to you. You have strange logic and arguments. What did you say? Trying to teach me. Oh elder brother. This has become a routine problem. Hey elder brother. - Don't shout l'm coming out. That you have been saying for the morning. lf you shout like this then l shall sit here till night. Even if that means not going to the office. Do that. Sit there day and night. Hey brother l have a recording today. Let me go in first. Everybody needs to go first. My school-master's job is not important. What a nuisance. Your school is on everyday. But without my.. ..background music the movie cannot be released. The let your movie be released first. My school can remain closed You use the bathroom. l'll take bath in the open verandah. Cinema and only cinema. lt's cinema while sitting. lts cinema while standing.. ..cinema while eating and cinema while sleeping too. Cinema has become everything now. The school is just a place for politics. ''Wait sir. Let me move out, then you lift the cloth above your knee.'' What? - l should also listen to you. Oh god l am in pain. Hey wife where are you? Hell is loose. Come pour water into everything. Even into the cooking fire. Did l do it on purpose. Some one has fallen down. The one who has fallen can get up.. But what you have done will leave all of us hungry today. Hey are you hurt. Yes my waist. lt seems it is damaged for ever. Get up. You don't seem to be hurt so much. Shut up. You will know if you are hurt like this. So you fell down. Why do you keep jumping around in this old age? Now lie down and be an invalid. Now you will become a liability and.. ..l have to bear it. Already l'm ..finding it difficult running this family. lt is all because of you. Hey son why are you going inside. l'm waiting here. l have no time to talk to non-intellectuals like you. Don't behave like that. You should be ashamed talking like that to elders. You are all to be blamed because you don't reprimand him. ls this a family where each one is only looking after himself? What have you done for the family? ''l have done enough. Do you get that, enough.'' That l have not got married and.. ..brought in a lot of children is enough. Listen. Don't tell me all these things. My bright career in music.. l don't have a wife who will lift me up. Come What are you saying? l contribute towards a quarter of your wages. Lift me against that. How will come and lift you. Look at your condition. Your cloth is not properly in position. l did a mistake by not having a family. Hey did you fall. Let me help you get up. Careful son. My daughters in law are good for nothing. Grandpa give me a rupee to buy some soap.. .. for washing the clothes. Where will l get money from? Everything has been taken away. Go and get that tin from the shelf. Here take this. Put some oil on my head. Here are some clothes for washing. Here are some clothes. Don't lose anything. Here are three clothes. Wash them well. Two pieces of clothes. Here take these two trousers. As the head of this family do justice.. ..or l leave and you wash these clothes. That is why no maid last more than three and half days here. lt's me who managed to stay longer. Four and half days. l'm leaving. You keep my wages for three and half days ready. Hey take this from here. Where is the washing soap. These clothes have to be washed. l don't know. lf you are going to the terrace then hang out my clothes on the line. We will need a servant only to hang the.. ..washed clothes on the line for drying. The maid has left. Will not come from tomorrow. What a slippery floor. What did you say. Oh sister. - What is it? The maid has left. What do you say? Who will wash all these blackened vessels? lt is because of your husband. He is after them so much that they run away. Don't say that sister. He is busy.. '',,running after me that he has no time left for anything else.'' Then l'm talking crap. He was telling her about leftists.. ..and rightists and all that crap. Why does he have to talk all that.. ..to the maid. There are students at the school to listen to all that. lf you keep finding fault with him then we can't stay together. Please stop talking lie this always. Why are you standing there with your mouth wide open? Go and wash the clothes. - No soap. Don't you know where the soap is? lt is in the bedroom closet. Yes dear. Will l be able to go to office today or not? From the morning l'm seeing only chaos. ''The brother can afford to stay away from his school, but l can't.'' How did you conclude that l could afford to stay away from school? You fell down and were in pain so l thought so. Don't make fun. lt is not nice to laugh at some body who's fallen down. Also l know that nobody other my wife.. .. will be bothered if l'm hurt. l can't use more plates. The maid has left and l can't wash all the plates. Oh hell. ls that so? The servant left and now the maid also? l think we will have to eat out now. Hey come sit down. Will you not eat? How can l sit on the floor wearing these trousers? Where will l find a dining table for you in the salary you get? Why wear a dress in which you cannot sit down and eat. Don't talk like a non-intellectual. This is the age of total freedom. Where are you going. Will you not eat? Forget him and get some salt. Hey youngest daughter in law. Why do you call her? She moves like a snail. Brother! That's it. The maid has also gone away. lt would be difficult to stay at home. Where to find a maid now? Why do we need a maid in this high cost of living? Krishna can do everything. What the hell are you doing? l am noticing for a long time that you are getting on my nerves. What the hell are you playing your own tunes for? Don't you have the notes? Then why the hell did you play a tune out of your own? Have l not discussed it with you. Can't you remember something so simple? Thinking about the maid sir. - What? The maid in our house has left. Play the tune after me. No gentleman no. You have again made a mistake. You've been working for the last 35 years. Why don't you retire? You'll also be saved and we would also be saved. - No l'll be doomed. lf l retire now then l shall have to beg on the streets with my family. Give me one more chance. l'll not make any more mistakes. What to do sir. There are so many problems. - That is problem with.. ..all of you. What is the problem now for you? ls the wife sick or is it the servants. - You spotted it correctly. The last one you said. - That is your problem these days.. ..l prepare my own breakfast.. ..and lunch l have outside. - You are a bachelor and moreover.. ..you are well placed. l can't be compared with you. - There.. ..you make a mistake. Bachelor and well placed has nothing to do with the way you live. Simplify the way you live. Do you know how much damage you are causing to the nation? What have l done sir? l don't have a lot of Children. Only none issue. No not that. What l mean is.. ..you have blocked your wives who have potential in the outside world. lf you don't let them out and properly canalise their energy and.. ..their impetus do you think that the nation can develop. - But sir would.. ..it not result in shifting the chaos at home to the outside world. You can go. lt is useless arguing with you. lt's wastage of time. But my dear young man. Times are changing fast. You can't hold them back. Hey listen to me. Can you get me a maid? You can't get a maid. They are tough to get. l can try for a male servant. Please try and get me one. l'll give you money for beedi. - l don't smoke.. ..beedi. l only smoke cigarettes. But l don't want anything from you. After all one person should be helping the other. - That's fine This is not correct. You're teachers. lnstead of teaching the children.. ..You've started fighting with each other. - Tell him. He is talking.. Like an uncivilized. He says l am an opportunist. - Yes l still say that You're not only an opportunist but also a.. - Listen to him sir. You're spoiling the students. You're provoking them against their guardians ''This is not a place for politics. This is a school. - l know it, sir.'' Every person has his own ideals and his own opinions. Who is he to interfere in that? - l can't avoid interfering sir. Do you know that they are taking away even the servants from our house? What is this? Why should he try to take away your servants? Not trying but he has chased them away. l do not where he stays and who are his servants. Must have not paid them properly and they must have left. Why blame my party for that? - Of course. l plead to both of you. Keep your shouting outside the school compound. Otherwise l would be forced to report this to the secretary. Coffee. l have finalized the design for that company's tie. Raw silk tie isn't it? Change this a little. The tie is hiding the figure too much. Do one thing. Make the tie thin like a thread. Will it then look like a tie? - Make it look like a Texas tie. Texas tie is not so popular. Ok let it be suggestive of a tie. Tie will be present in spirit and content. The form may be absent. One more thing. The tie is used by men. How can it match with a women's figure? lf l have a few more designers like you.. ..then l will have to wind up my publicity business. Think of the modern times and trends. Today each and every male commodity .is being sold on.. ..the basis of a woman's figure. That's the box office appeal today. This is an era of displaying woman's figure for any male attention. ln short this is an era of triple S. Triple S! ''Yes. S for Sex, S for sadism and S for shock.'' Yes shock. ''You also work as a film critic, isn't it?'' What is your opinion about.. ..exposure and nudism. Do you know what the latest craze is? ls their something which is the latest? No sir. There are more things in heaven and earth. The latest thing is Shockumentary. Shockumentary! The public have to be given shock like the shock therapy. The old timers might call it obscene.. ..and crude. But mark me they will ultimately rsuh.. .. to see it. The whole of mankind has entered a confusing stage.. .. and we shall keep giving them shock through literature.. ''..through painting, music and movies.'' What is the benefit? We do not think of the benefit. We only move with changing ..times matching step to step. You change the tie publicity. We cannot avoid showing the tie so show something. lt would be more appealing to show a bare body. Show the tie somewhere. Either in her hands or only around the neck. Oh come on my queen come on. Boss. Who is that girl? - That one. That old man's daughter - Yes. A very tough girl. - They are all like that in the beginning. Let us see. l got you. Why do you scare me? How long l have been waiting. l skip college and wait here and you are coming so late. What do l do? Finished all the work but had to massage her. l was waiting for a chance to get out. The moment she started snoring l came out. ''Oh god, do women also snore.'' No just snoring but full blast. Shouldn't speak like that about elders. - What? They only make me.. ..work and abuse me. lf my parents were alive could they do this? Let somebody do this to my sister in law. She would silence them all. Here have some candies. The rush in the trams and buses.. ..and the tensions in the office.. ..life has become a hell. Papa it is difficult without servants. Why did you chase them away. - Listen to him. l did not chase them. Nobody will work for such low wages How can they survive on low wages? Survival is not out of wages. Birth and death depends on divine prepositions. You have so much money which you got after retirement. Give something out of that. Give you! l will but only after my death. lf l give it now and do not die fast.. ..then l would have no money.. ..and you all would have also deserted me. lf you die half of it will go for death tax. Give us something now. lf l give you now then gift tax has to be paid. Talking with you is.. Ok you have mother's jewelry. Give that. lt is worth ten thousand rupees. What will you do with that? lt's 22-carat gold. The government has banned that. Now it is the age of 14 carat. What metal are you made of? Who's that. - Heard that you are looking for a servant. l heard that and came. Will you hire me? Yes. Krishna call your sister in law. Wait. Let the women of the house come to discuss with you. Call them it is better to get everything cleared in the beginning. ''But sir, l would like to know why the earlier one left.'' How do we tell you why she left? Krishna manage the vegetables. Today's servants have their own ways. ''Ok, what wages would you take?'' We will decide the wages. You tell the work to be done. l don't want trouble on that account later.- How many people. ..are there in this family? - Nine to ten. Nine to ten! What work is to be done? ''Drawing water, grinding spices and washing clothes.'' All these? Doesn't anybody do anything here? - No but you'll have.. ..no problem here. You will be like a member of the family. ''Does anybody keep their servants like family members, madam?'' ''Listen, l will take fifty rupees per month and..'' ..l will not do any women's work. You are thinking fifty rupees is high. l am being offered sixty rupees in Alipore but l'm not going.. ..because there are more family members there. We find it convenient to work for a bachelor. No problem from the women and the work loan is also low. We can't pay you so much. - Wait.. ..papa wait. Let me talk. We can't do without a servant. Listen to me lad. We'll pay you thirty rupees for the first month. Then depending on your work we'll give you a raise. lf l survive this huge family for.. ..one month then only will you give me the raise. You think it over and l'll get in touch with you tomorrow. Take that. You list out a lot of work to the servant. Will they stick if you take so much work? These opportunists have doomed the nation. Problem after problem Papa why do you spent 24 hours in this room. You should go out and get some exercise. Don't shout. Do you think l'm your student? Listen this. A good advice and he gets annoyed. lts seven in the evening and.. .. l have not even got a cup of tea. How can you work out in empty stomach. How would l know that you haven't got your tea. The school was off at 4 p.m. l'm returning after two tutions. l've also not had anything to eat. Please give me that container. l'll send Krishna. Krishna. See what papa wants. Brother have you been to the market or should l have to run now. You have already started your drinks. You are great. Don't talk to your elder brother like that. Whatever it be he is elder to you. Don't advise me. lt is not good for the children that he is drinking at home. At least he is doing it at home. lf he would have.. Got drunk and then comes home and shouts will it look nice? First look at yourself before blaming others lf we disagree in everything then we cannot stay together. How can we bring up our child? Ok then its all right. lf you can live anywhere else then go. lf we had an alternative then we would have gone. - Yes. The spirit lamp is off. Wait. Boil these two eggs. l'll give half to you. Where are going? - to get some water. Don't go out. That brother would come to know. Even if l come to know l will not ask for a share. Are you not ashamed of secretly eating when there is small child at home. l'm not drinking alcohol like the elder brother. l'm only eating eggs. Why are you furious about that? lf there would have been some snacks at home.. Snacks? How much do you contribute? - Fifty rupees. For that money you can't expect snacks. So l don't eat here. You enter this house and the problems start. How does one pursue his career? Uncle don't fall again. You are also after me. l'm your uncle.. ..born after your father. ''lf you are after my father, then who is before him.'' Me. l'm your elder uncle. But your father does not regard me much. Come on go to your room. Such an alcoholic. ' Once come and try being my beloved' ' Come and stay by my side.' Did l send you there for employment. Couldn't you stick there.. .at least for two days. - So many persons and.. .. so much work. l would've died.- Hell with you. l wantetd you to find where they keep the money. You spoiled everything. lf nobody turns up in a day or two then l'll go. Go now. - Now they will get suspicious. Has Pintoo had his food? - Yes. Again bread. l have told a thousand times that l get.. ..indigestion having bread. Can't you cook some rice? - No. Do you know how difficult it is to get rice these days. How would you know. You are busy playing that crap. lt's not crap. - Ok. We are lucky that America is feeding us. Brother America gives us wheat and not rice. We could have managed without that also. - You act as if you know.. ..everything. How can we manage without the aid from America? There are other countries that would have provided the aid. - Like? No pint in discussing this with you. First understand the difference between food problem and food crisis. l'll pinch your ears you monkey. That's why l don't talk to you. You always behave like a.. ..a school master even at home. - Stop this and eat. Finish your dinner and let me rest. There is not maid & all these dishes to be washed. No one would help. Where you telling that to me? l wasn't telling you. Why're you dragging me to a fight? - The way you.. ''..said it, l thought it's me. - Can't help if you think like that?'' Will you stop it. All these nonsense From the morning l'm hearing these complaints. Won't you allow me to eat in peace? Can't sleep also properly because you'll start playing that instrument. Keep the windows closed. The music won't reach you. No it is heard even if the windows are closed. Please don't play it.. ..today. l've to correct some school papers. - lt is also a profession.. ..like the school teachers job of yours. Not a toy that l'm playing. What you do is primitive. Most back dated. ''You play background music for the movies, isn't it? The big directors..'' .. avoid background music totally. - ls that so? ''Probably you know better. - Yes, they may be still using ..'' ..it in Bengali movies but they don't use it continental movies. What? - Continental. Who doesn't use it? They are famous directors of the modern cinema. They are all young and they.. ..give new things in very movie they make. They hide nothing. They expose everything. Even nudity. Stop it lad. Your father is here. You have no regards for us. At least give your father some respect. - They don't give in the continent. You work in a publicity firm. How did you know all this? One should read to know all this. That day at the coffee house.. - Nobody seems to be bothered.. ..about an eighty year old man living in this house. That day you wanted all my money. What blood flows inside you. Since we are your children obviously it's your blood. This house doesn't appear to be mine. Looks like a hostel. All of you talk so much crap. No discipline at all. You go inside papa. l'll send your dinner inside. You are yet to send it. You're also useless like your.. ..those useless husbands of yours'. Why are you standing here. Can't you hear your father calling us.. ..s useless. Why don't you go and give him his dinner. - There is no.. ..bread left. - So what. Why can't you make some for him? Have your hands broken of or are they tied up? Go and feed the old man and wash the dishes. No maid and this demon like family. Sister l heard that you need a servant. Yes. You wait and l'll call.. ..everybody. They are all sleeping. Sleeping? What is this? lt's already six. This is the best time to work. l think that l'll have to stay longer here. ''You wait, l'll wake up everybody. Grandpa..'' ..wake up. A servant has come. Who's that? Look there a person has come. Let me call the others. Who are you? l'm Dhananjay. Heard that you need a servant. Listen my sons and daughters in law. Come and see who has come. What happened? He says he is ready to work here. You wait papa. Don't be desperate. Just because we don't have a servant.. .. should we hire anybody we get. We should inquire and then hire. Papa you surprise me. Where are you coming from? Do you know anybody here? l know everybody but whether they know me or not is doubtful. Do you have any certificate? Those with whom you've worked.. ..before. Any letter from them. - Letter? Oh yes. Here it is. PC Roy. Who is that? Acharya Prafulla Chandra Roy of.. ..Bengal science college. He died long ago. Oh no he is still alive. ln every Bengali's heart. You stop that brother. Hey what work do you know? __ Everything sir. That everybody says. Later they say they can't do this and that. Once l have come to work how can l refuse work. Are you not a schoolteacher? How did you know? l have seen you going to school. l notice everything around me. Since you are a teacher you must be aware of Swami Vivekananda.. ..and his teachings that work is worship. Stop all this crap. Where are you coming from. At present from Sashasram. From a cemetry. No its Sashram. The place which gives peace When peace descends then everything is fine. When there is no peace then.. - Don't even say about it. We are dying without any peace. Will there be any peace here? Why not. lt would if we try. ''No, never. There can't be any peace in this house'' Stop it papa. All useless talk. Do you know cooking? ''Yes. Bengali, English, Chinese, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marathi..'' We don't need all that. Tell us what Bengali dishes you know? ''Everything. Pulses, Gravy and other dishes.'' Different types in the same dish. Can you cook spinach. That's simple. l'll cook some thing different for you. ''Take some cauliflower, the middle portion. The left leg..'' ..of the lamb some six green chilly.. .. and some oil. We don't eat much of meat. We prefer fish. That's fine madam. Fish can be cooked in a variety of dishes. Can you cook fish in curd? Haven't had it for ages. That's simple l'll also treat you with a similar dish one day. A very special dish. What? - A very special fish delicacy. Fish cooked in mustard. l have never heard of this before. Does everybody hear everything? Cooking is actually an art. Like other arts here also there is constant improvisations. Different sauces and curries. Different ingredients and different tastes. l'll give you a special sauce. Made of olives and mustard. Very tasty. Pregnant women like it a lot. Why pregnant women? l also like it. Prepare that once. l have not had good food for a long time. Don't say that papa. l'm preparing whatever l know. ln fact l'm only doing that the whole day. l have never got out of the bondage with the kitchen. Don't say that. The place you work is the place of pleasure too. Hey sister he has already started lecturing us. lt is not a lecture but the blunt fact. Suppose l make you the mayor of this city. Can you handle it. No isn't it? So wherever you are show your efficiency there. What wages do you expect? What do l tell you sir. You decide about it. Start from twenty rupees. - You said twenty? How is that possible? Such a big family and such high cost of living. Then you tell us what you want. Pay me twelve rupees. Will it be a problem? - No not at all. You start work. Take him inside and show him the work. - Come along. Come here. Show me the place where l'll stay. l'll keep these and start work. Krishna now uses that room. You can use that. Krishna will stay below the stairs. l think she is not your daughter. Yes she is my husband's younger brother's daughter. Are both her parents dead? - Yes.. ..they have dumped her on us and are comfortable in heaven. ls that so? Let me take your things to your room. Why help the servants sister. Let me get fresh. Have you bought the things for the day? Hey this is very slippery. Some one will fall and break his head. You said it. Every day some one or the other slips and falls. There seems to be a problem for you cleaning it. There is a problem getting a sweeper into the house. So it remains. Can l get some coconut kernels? Kernels? lt is over there. Ok. Look now it is all clean. You can jump and dance and nothing will happen. Look at me. What is the matter? Will l have to go out for a cup of tea? He is shouting early in the morning. Let the new servant be shown around first. Just wants a chance to yell. Don't talk rubbish. Do you know its already half pas six? - So what? People around must have already had a cup of tea You can make your tea like you boil your own egg. Don't worry l'll do that. You shut up. We can't control our youngsters these days. The youngsters of today will not get married.. ..but have all the related fun. lf you talk like this about young generation then.. ..you will get the respect due to an uncle. Sir the tea is ready. Come have some tea. You have still not brushed your teeth? Ok have it without brushing your teeth. Here give it to everyone. Here is the milk for your son. Let me give tea to the old man. ''Sir, here is your tea.'' So early! lt's not early. lt's already quarter to seven. From tomorrow l'll give it you early. Have it. Wait l'll give you a massage. Where did you get the things to prepare this tea. Why everything was in the Kithchen. The madam has stocked it with everything. What shall l cook today? The vegetables have been bought but the fish. ..has to be bought now. - Let it be. We'll eat vegetarian food today. From tomorrow l'll do the shopping. What's in that? - These? These are my cooking tools. This is for mutton. This is for chicken. Tell me what this is for? For the sweet dish. We have got all these things but not so nice. Where did you get these? That is a strange experience. l was in the Himalayas. There was snow on all sides. The lake was in the middle. l met a lady there. ln fact the goddess of food. She told me to get the divine lotus from the lake. She said she would make a sweet dish out of that. She took a small ladle.. ..and made a sweet dish out of that lotus. After eating l pleaded to her to give me the ladle. She gave it to me. l melted that ladle and made all these. Like you make jewelry. 'No wealth is more precious than the gods name. Chant his name.' You take bath. The lunch will be ready shortly. l am not comfortable with that man. - No fear. He will not stick long sustaining your torture. Don't talk rubbish. What torture do we do? Let me also hear. Forget it. Don't start a fight before going to work. Let me take bath or else that brother will get inside the bathroom. Sir. Your hot water. l'll leave it inside the bathroom. They way he is working he will cook in ten minutes. l'm scared. Hope he is not some wizard or black magic. You have to find some fault or the other. Don't bother me. Go and get my clothes from the terrace. Sir. Here are your clothes and the towel. Keep this with you. You are an artist. You should not bother about trivial things. lt will affect your art. Are you pulling my leg. What are you saying sir? l am your servant and you are my master. l can't believe this. Always people have been making fun of my music. So l am not able to believe you. l thought of making a great career in music. But nothing has been achieved. Don't be dejected sir. You concentrate on your music and l'll look after you. What are you doing. l'm writing an article about movies. Don't disturb me. Shall l get you something to help you be comfortable. No. l'm not writing about Bengali movies. lts about foreign movies like Truffau etc You can find a lot about the subject you are writing in this magazine. What is this? Where did you get it? l got it while working for a famous movie director. Both national and international magazines used to come there. The wife used to give it to me for using in the oven. Do you have more of these? - Yes a lot of them. Please give it to me. l can use them. Take your bath. The meal is ready. All the madams. Please sit down for the meal. You can eat together with the males and chat while eating. What do you mean? - What is wrong in that. lt will be fun seeing all of you eat together. Let me feed the old man first. Here please help me. Sir l have brought your meal. The meal? So Early? lt's impossible. lts god to eat early. - l also wanted that.. ..but they never gave it to me early. l see that you have given me some milk. - lts good to have some milk.. ..at your age. - l know but they never gave me. Come now and eat it. Oh this the betel nuts for you. l have pounded it. See how much you take care. My wife was also like this. - Ok have it. That is always like that. Eat slowly. How many dishes has he made. Every dish is superb. l haven't had such a meal for a long time. All of you enjoy and eat it. Give me some of that mutton. lt's not mutton sir. Today its vegetarian. That is green banana. Surprising. l also thought that it is mutton. ''Why not, you are an intelluctual.'' Banana has iron.. ..and mutton has protein. So.. Stop that. Let us eat peacefully at least today. After ten minutes he came. He came with that smile for which.. ..the great actor is famous and said did l keep you all waiting. l said that it was no botheration at all. l asked him as to what he had to say about his fans in Bengal. With a serious face he said that he respected them very much. What modesty? l was thinking that l'm sitting before the great actor of Bengal.. ..and he being so great did not show it at all and was.. ..so modest and so simple. That wonderful smile and great personality. ..gave the surroundings a different look. - Like you have Uttam Kumar.. ''..popular today, during our times it was Durgadas.'' l've seen a movie of his. ''Pahari Sanyal, Durgadas and Chayadevi.'' Durgadas acted so well in that movie. What are you telling mama.. ..nobody can be more popular than Uttam Kumar. 'Six boys tried to climb the tree.' Who? Alok. What are you doing here? Oh mother. l'm doomed. You said everybody is chatting. Let me run away. What the hell do you think coming here? - Catch him. Catch that boy. Catch that rascal. You come here. What were you doing with that boy? ''You little rascal, we'll break your bones.'' What do you think you are doing? - She needs a good thrashing. We'll reach her a lesson today. Sir. They are all thrashing Krishna together. She has made a mistake and is getting punished. She deserves it. Maybe there is no mistake. Could have been just chatting with one of her friends. You feel it is not correct. - l think it is not correct. ''But if you think it is correct, then it is all right.'' After all l'm a servant in this house. - No. Not at all. You ar right. Let us go and settle it. What do you think that this is your father's house? You think you can do anything you like? Who gave you the authority to beat her? She was with our neighbor Alok inside a room. What she's done is nothing wrong. She can sit with ten others if she wants. You come here. How did the old man gather so much courage suddenly? Let my husband come l'll set this right. Le my husband also come l'll report this. No madams. He is old and must have lost his head. Forget this. lf he has lost his head let his sons put him in a mental asylum. You are the senior most woman in the family. You should not talk like this. You shut up. All big talks. Go and do your work. What work do you want me to do? Shall l get you some tea? l don't want anything. l will not eat anything in this house. l will also not eat anything. He has the audacity to insult us like this. Get lost - Go away from here. Sister Krishna don't cry. ''Don't cry. You don't gain by crying, Now get up.'' Wipe your tears. Tell me what happened? Alok will not talk to me any more. Yes he will. Tell me what is the matter? Saw that new servant in the halder house. Saw him and also made inquiries. lt appears that he is more cunning than us. He belongs to our profession. - How did you make out. Only a thief can recognise another one. ''Sir, - Who is that?'' Listen - Don't hand me over to the police. - Listen to me first. lf you are so scared then why did you start it at all? What did l start? - Going to a girls house. You should have the guts to do such things. How can you be a coward? Who said that l am a coward. Don't tell me all that. l don't care for anybody. ''There, you are talking like a man.'' Come l want to talk to you. What is the matter? Why are you on the bed? Has the servant left again? - No. Then what is wrong with you? Sent me to my parent's house. You have been to your parent's house for the last 15 years. We even don't know whether they Are alive or dead. Don't play the fool with me. Now go from here and let me stay alone for some time. Yes. l am the fool out here. l am not from such a family that your father will insult me.. ..and l will bear it all and still hang around here. Do something about it or send me somewhere. Don't shout. Tell me what happened. Sir. Your soda and some snacks. ''Madam, your tea. - Soda?'' This is country liquor. How will soda go along with country liquor. - What's wrong.. ..have it. You'll like it. Have your drinks.. ..with some snacks. You won't have indigestion. Why should l bear the insult and stay in this house. lf we can't stay separate then you stay here. l'll take my son and.. ..go to the streets. - Don't be foolish. Going to the streets with.. ..your son. You must be crazy. Do you know anything about the outside world? ''Sir, tea for you. Tea for you too madam.'' You take this madam. Milk for the son. Have some snack along with your tea. Then l'll give you a high tea. Couldn't make anything special. Something simple but tasty. See and learn. - You see.. ..and you learn. What are you doing? When wll you boil that egg and when will you eat it? Why am l here? Why have you hired me? Sit down and eat this. Some simple but tasty snacks. What are you eating boiled eggs daily? Correctly said. You are my wife. l have a responsibility towards you. - what concern? What right has papa to insult you like that? No. This needs to be protested. ''Yes, l should protest.'' Will none of you protest against this? Hey brothers.. ..such an injustice on my wife.. ..and none of you are coming froward to protest. Ok never mind. l'll go alone. Why did you insult my wife? After all she is your son's wife. They were beating up your sister. Why did you have to interfere? Picking up unnecessary arguments. Have you jointly come to fight with me? Has anybody in this family ever worked together? Have we dome anything jointly? The elder brother will speak for his wife. l will speak for my wife. Now listen to me. Whatever l have done is correct. lf you don't like it you can go away. Dhanajay. - Yes sir. - Massage my back dear. See how he insulted us. - Keep dancing to your wife's tune. You also came dancing to your wife's tune. You are so old but.. ..your body is still in shape. So smooth and robust. We had a discipline in life. Yes we were very disciplined. Press here. - Yes as hard as iron. Why don't you go out for a walk in the morning. l'll catch cold. No sir. l'll dress you up warm and give you a cup of tea. You go for a walk. l'm getting the confidence hearing you. 'Who l am and who's son l am'' 'the world in very strange'' 'Where l have come from and where l shall go'' 'The company of good people would provide salvation.'

' Nothing is permanent or worth lamenting' ' Nothing is permanent or worth lamenting' Fine. You are lucky brother. You have got such a person. We'll everyday for chanting the god's name. ''Of course, you are welcome. - Grandpa tea.'' Give. You give it and l'll also give. Krishna has grown up a lot. l haven't met you for the last ten to twelve years. Though we are neighbors. This Dhananjay has brought about this change. My grandson Alok talks a lot about your family. Says that there cannot be a person like you. Does he say that? Send him. l would like to meet him. ''Krishna, Distribute the contents of that container..'' .. amongst everybody here. l'll get it sir. Krishna. Oh Krishna. You seem o be busy hearing the songs there. Don't you have any work? l will go there in future. You will not go there! Enjoying the pampering of your grandpa? Have you brought the clothes from the terrace. - Here it is madam. l have ironed all of them. Yours and the sir's clothe; all of them. Shall l get you some tea. No. Where is my tobbaco. Here it is madam. Good quality tobacco. Shall l get you some tea. The afternoon nap became a little long. You will feel better if you have tea. l said no. Don't bother me. Go and find out from my daughter in law.. ..she might need something. Being a mother why are you still angry with that child. You have punished her.. ..for her mistake already. ''The tobacco is good, isn't it?'' Alok gave it. Now l'll get some tea with ginger in it. Then give me also some tea. Sleeping at odd times the body is feeling stiff. l'll get it without dealy. Did you also sleep in the afternoon. What else to do. l'm getting bored. No work do to do at all. Eating and sleeping and again eating. Getting fat. Ramu get some tea. Big brother have some tea and go. ''No brother. The tea at the office, l don't like its taste at all.'' The tea that l have at home you should taste it then you will know. As if l walked with a mug of hot water to darjeeling.. ..and tea leaves dropped into the mug. So fresh. Here l have checked it all. Just sign them and send them ln this old age you are working so hard. l warn you. Don't call me old. l'm only sixty years old. Have you finished typing the draft agreement. - No l'm doing it slowly. - What is this? How will it do if you are so slow? - l'm having a headache. Get up and go out in the open air. Let me do it. Sit down. What is the matter? - Which matter are you talking about. Everything is upto date. The files.. ..account books and everything. You are taking everybody's work. What is the matter? lf there is peace of mind then there is an energy to work. l think that some one is.. ..inspiring you. - You are right sir. Who is the perosn.. .inspiring you. Have you found a new girl friend? Oh god. Playing with a top early in the morning. Then why wake up early? You told me to wake up early. - yes.. ..but then you must study. l don't like studying. Then do some drawing. l don't like that also. Then sing that song l taught you. 'The eyes says wake up.' 'Sleep do not come anymore' 'lf this life is lost then it does not come back again.' Have some tea and if you feel have another nap. 'Remember that in this world it is tough.' 'Dream to make a heaven out of this earth.' Get up. How late will you sleep. Have l got to wash the streets.. ..that l have to get up early? Some body singing in our house. lsn't it Pintu? - Yes the servant has taught him. ''Get up, sleeping like a sick man.'' Let me listen to the song. 'Why are still lying down.' What you got and what you lost; think about that.' Hey come on wake up. l have brought your tea. Get up. A house wife sleeping so late. Tea has been served? - Yes Give me. - Take it. Who is singing? Sounds like Pintu.- Yes it is Pintu. Dhananjay has taught him. Who else sings in this house? That Pintu has such a sweet voice.. ..even l did not know being his mother. Let us do some work. lf this life is lost then it does not come back again. Such ancient words Such simple words. l never knew it but Pintu knows it. lf this life is lost then it does not come back again. Did you understand it. We should do some good work. You are right. l have to do some work. This wretched servant wouldn't let me do any work. How can just sit and eat at this age. What are you doing uncle. Smoking like a non-intellectual. Why are you not playing your music. l was planning to do that. Why don't you play some Bach? Some symphony of Bach.The children would love it. Bach? - Yes. - You want to listen? - Yes. - Sit down. l'll bring for a walk every morning. - Will you not.. ..be wasting your time. - Not at all. Which class are you in? - l'm in the college.. Good. - Krishna can also come with us for the morning walk. They wouldn't let her. They make her work from the morning. Sir. How are you liking your morning walk? - Good. l told you. You carry on with your walk. l'll get the shopping done. You work in that house. - Yes. What is your plan tell us in detail. What is there to tell in detail? You must have already understood. Have you found something worth? l haven't found it yet. We have found it but can't get inside the house. You will get in when the time comes. Didn't l tell you that only a gm can recognise another gem. But you cannot get way alone with loot from our area. Can l do that? Ok come along. - Where? Come you'll know. Come Boss he has come. ''The cot in which the old man sleeps, underneath that there is a box.'' Open the door on Friday night. Not Friday but Saturday. That night is good. They would be sleeping.. ..well since it would be weekend. Today is Saturday. - Can do it today. Ok Commission? - ten percent. Twelve and half percent. Ten percent. - Twelve and half percent. Nobody bargains with me. They are happy.. ..with what l give. - Twelve and.. ..half percent. Let us finish the job and then decide. Sister now you get up. l'll wash the rest of it. No let me do some work. You carry with your work. This life will not come back. lsn't it sister. - Yes. Please let me also do some work. You are not used and will fall sick. Listen to her. Your uncle kept me in.. ..a golden cot to sleep all day. Listen to her. What is this. This is not fair. When there is a servant why should you work. Never say that again. l warn you. One person will do all the work and we will just lie down. That's right. You cut those vegetables. That l will do. - You? Why you think l can't do it? Madam then shall l attend to the sirs. - Ok do that. But don't go inside the kitchen. Why you say that? You better teach us cooking. The sirs enjoy your cooking very much. ''Let me iron it for you. - Labour is a perishable commodity, Dhananjay.'' lf you don't work then you lose the capacity to work. You are right. Very wise words. What are you thinking? About music. The director has asked me o compose something. lf the music does not have depth the heroin would refuse to act. Start with the basic tunes. - what? - The basic tunes. No dialogue. l got it. l got it. You gave it to me. What did l do. lt was all done by you. Your brother is correct. What did he say? That given an opportunity you would have been a great musician. Can't believe it. They have always made fun of my taste fro music. Oh no sir. That is not correct. He always praises you. He was telling the other day.. ..that he did not marry thinking that it would cause problem for us. Did he say that? - Yes. - No l don't believe you. ''Sir, don't tell him that l told you. - Ok.'' Why should l tell him? You do one thing. For both the sisters in law and the daughter in law.. ..get three cinema tickets. l'll pay for it. What about Krishna? - Yes l forgot her. Get one for her also. l feel that you leave Krishna today. You take them with you. That's ok. l'll take Pintu also with us. Sir. You should free your wife today in the afternoon. When have l held on to her in the afternoon? Your youngest brother is taking all the ladies to a cinema. Can't believe it. Younger brother spending money.. ..and taking them to a cinema. What are you saying? You know what he said now? Must have cursed me. - No he said that you may be harsh.. .. outside but you are very soft inside. lf he needs he could have topped the school. Why is he so considerate about me suddenly? After all he is your younger brother. He knows that you love him. He is a good lad. Has a nice heart. Poor thing never got an opportunity in life. What to do. Hey Dhanajay. Look at this thing My boss was after me and he.. ..was bent upon getting me retired. Now they have written to me that.. ..they are giving me three years extension.- That is good news What good news. l have been saved. You took care of our family and l got peace of my mind and worked hard. Don't tell this to my brother. He will feel jealous. Not jealous but he will be pained. Why will he be pained. He was telling the other day. What? - don't tell him l told you. No l will not. Tel me what he said. He said that he will not let you work any more. He has worked all along his life. l'm there The other brothers are there Can't we run this family? l can't believe this. Yes sir it is true. - Brother. Did you not take bath today. First you finish then l'll go. You have to go along way. That does not matter. You go first. No you bath first lt would be convenient if you get out early/ The rush in the bus would be less. No l'm elder and l'm asking you to bath first. You are old and need some time. l can rush to work. Don' bother for me you go first. Don't you have college today? No grandpa. Let me massage the oil. No l'll do it. - What is wrong if l do it? What is wrong if l do it Both of you do it. Will you come today afternoon? - No You come here. All of them are going for a movie. Who is going to the movies? - Both the aunts and my sister in law. You won't go? - lf everybody goes who'll stay with you?. Take me also.. ..to the movie one day son. Sure. Tell me when you want to go? Why do you scare me. She calls me and is asleep. l was reading. You have all sort of excuses. Get up. You have no mind to study l can understand. - How do you say that? l know everything. l'm not a fool. What will you do inside the house. Let's go out. lf someone sees us. - Forget it. Let them see us. l don't care if they see. Grandpa will protect us. Why are you so scared. However long we talk it is never satisfying. You did all the talking. l couldn't say anything. You do your talking the next time we meet. ''Oh Krishna. Krishna, what are you doing?'' l was studying auntie. - Oh studying. Ok study. How was the movie? - Nice. lt made us cry as well as laugh. l'll pick up the clothes and go. l'll do it auntie. You go and rest. No l'll do it. You continue your studies. Sir. Sir. l am doomed brother Dhnanajay. The aunts have come back. Not only the aunts but the uncles are also back. Today is Saturday. How do l go now. Jump the wall. You are a male. Ok. - Sir. l want to know something. Do you really like Krishna. Will you keep her happy? What are you talking brother Dhannajay. Good. Today is Saturday. Meet me tomorrow early in the morning. OK. Those are my Jewels. l bought it for your mother. l will not give it to anybody as along as l live. lf you don't like it then you can leave. Then do as you like it. Keep it with you. We'll bury it along with you when you die. Fine what belongs to me will go along with me. l have seen such a father in my life. Wouldn't you ever listen to some good advice? Don't you.. ..ever feel that you can't get back this life? That those ..jewels would be of better use to your children. Which children are you talking about? Today l'm alive because of Dhananjay. There is not point in being alive like this. Why are you trying to explain to this man. He is abusing you in return. You saw it. He will lose it one day and then he'll understand. That would serve him better. Whatever you say l will not give those jewels. l will not surrender my security. Dhananjay. - Yes sir. Take it out. - What is that? Drug for putting everybody to sleep. Will sleep like a log. Take that out. Well done. Now you go and meet me tomorrow at my den. Sir. Wait. Where is my commission? - Come to my den tomorrow morning. l have another tomorrow morning. l want it now. You want it now? - Yes all of it. Everybody seems to be sleeping long. What is the matter? Dhannajay. Oh Dhananjay. Papa. Get up. Oh god! Theft. Thief! Hey brothers come here fast. ''Dhananjay come here. Papa, get up fast.'' We have been doomed. - What happened? Happened my head. See for yourself. We are doomed. All of your mother's jewels were here. What do we do now? Keep it all with yourself then.. ..this is what will happen. What happened? Why are you shouting? - We are doomed. All our mother's jewels have been robbed. - Where is Dhananjay? We are doomed. All the jewels have been robbed. What did we gain when we had it? What are saying? lt was worth ten thousand rupees. Ten thousand or twenty thousand.. ..it was not useful to us. lt is the same whether we have it or it is lost. Very correct. Now he will have a heart attack because of this. No he will not. The old man is not attached to anything. But those jewels were worth a lot of money Dhananjay. Nothing to worry sir. lt is better you have donated.. ..it rather than sitting on it. He said it. He was just sitting on those jewels. You shut up. What wrong did he say. You could have made.. ..some arrangement before this happened. What arrangement? Give to you all? Yes. At least your sons would have used it. Now the robbers are enjoying it. Yes l already warned him. Did l not tell him yesterday? Yes but it fell on deaf ears. You are annoyed with me. What do you think l should have done. You should have given us the jewels and we would have looked after you. Now you are telling this.. ..but earlier l was totally neglected by you all. All of that valuable jewels have been lost? ''Listen auntie, you have not lost them.'' This is the jewel box. - Here it is. - What a surprise. Here is your jewel grandpa. See whether everything is intact or not. Where did you get it son? - Caught the thieves and took it from them. You caught them? - Something like that. Bless you dear lad. You are brave. May you live long! Like this show bravery in serving the country. You are the future of the country. Keep talking brother. You oration is really good. l can talk a lot. But in life.. ln life! Papa. Hey eldest son. - Yes papa. Take these jewels and give me freedom to seek salvation. Salvation from the worldly attractions. - Me? No cannot take responsibility of these jewels at this age. Younger brother you take care of these. Me? l am a school master and l can't handle this burden. Younger.. ..brother you keep it with you. l'm a bachelor. What will l do with these jewels? Sister in law.. ..you keep them. - Me and jewels.. ''..Oh no, l can't keep it. Sister you keep it'' l am very careless let your son keep it An intellectual cannot be involved in materialistic things. You may.. ..keep it if you want. Why do l need jewels when you are there. Let Krishna keep it. Now all of you are happy? Where is Dhanajay? - Here. He was here. - Where did he go. - l saw him just now. ''Go and find him. - Where did he go? - Surprising, he was here now.'' Look upstairs. Hey Dhanajay where are you? Where did this man go? l suspect that he has left. l can't find his luggage. - ls that so? Dhananjay has left. - What are you saying? He did not inform us at all. He has not even taken his wages. We can send the wages to his address. - Do you have his address? How sad. Didn't even take his wages. Oh brother Dhannanjay. Stop. Why are you leaving? My job is over. Will you not come again. lt will not be necessary.
