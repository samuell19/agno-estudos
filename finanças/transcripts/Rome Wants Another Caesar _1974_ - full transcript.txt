We are in Numidia, a small North African province, conquered by Caesar in 46 BC. To retain it, Caesar has sent here one of his men of confidence, the propraetor Titus Sextius. In fact, from an economic point of view, it is a true source of wealth. From here, the Romans can control a big part of the Saharan trade and to supply the Latin world with a big slice of the tropical wealth. In order to guarantee Rome this riches, Titus Sextius has confiscated all the lands in the south which he needed to control the caravans. He formed a sort of local army consisting of Numidians and Mauritians. and he himself wanted to take his residence in one of the last villages, near the border. The peasants, robbed of their lands, are forced to seek refuge on the hills But very soon they formed bandit groups assaulting the caravans headed for Rome. Young Romans, who already lived there, or old republicans, who are against Caesar, have embraced the cause of the rebels. and in a short while managed to turn the Numidians' fight against Titus Sextius into an ideological battle against Rome and against Caesar. What is your name? - Claudius. But it is not my real name. Your compatriots are killing us! The propraetor had 3000 Numidians killed. Now he even arrests the Romans that sympathize with us. but naturally he doesn't kill them, your flesh is privileged! Do you see these bodies? You find a lot of them in these hills. My friend, we don't have to bury the bodies, but throw them into the face of the world! It is our time. The time of the minorities. The time in which small groups of free men have to move alone and speak and act, in the name of all those who will follow later on. You shouldn't think that only he has done so. All the Romans want to be like Caesar. Each of them wants to have his own statue in the four corners of the world. Don't expect to meet a just Roman. He speaks as a friend to force you to something. He wants your slavery. Who is Roman, is guilty by nature. Therefore, one must never have pity for anyone, not even for those who seem innocent. But you are Roman. It seems to me that your hate is something personal and maybe there is resentment in your words. And I think that you are not here to help but to provoke us. It is not true, and you know it well. Here, they are coming! Prepare yourself! We swear that we will fight! That we will give our lives and those of our friends! Until we see you fall! We will fight even beyond your death! So that after you also your works shall fall! We swear! That one in the blue tunica is our friend. We mustn't kill him. Advance! Advance! Come! There is no danger. Do you see? There are not many, and they also seem courageous because they are led by an authority. We have to succeed in destroying the myth of authority. Thus, the people will begin to understand that the Power is not immortal. Now we are few, but soon we will be a movement. They are Romans. Friends. You are free, friends! You preach that Numidia is with you and that these soldiers are loyal. Watch how they flee now, do you see? They are frightened. And you know, why? Because they feel that what they do is not just. They are Numidians. As soon as they see your fragility, they are ready to betray you. What do you want from me? What do you think? Leave me. I am not the person you are looking for. You are not the person we are looking for? Really? You are Romans. What are your names? But how, you don't remember me? I have never seen you in my life. Numidia is full of people like you. You are really very good at lying. Lying and killing with the same ease. Caesar will be proud of you. I am not armed and you can kill me if you want. But let me say that these methods are cowardly, worthy of the people here. We don't have problems. If you want to feel yourself Roman, just fight against me. Or against me. We have to decide who of us has to kill him. Run! The one without a sword will be the executioner. I am always on the side of those who want to liberate me. But I had preferred you to fight against him. You could have lost. But if you had won in a duel, I would have embraced you like a true Roman. But he didn't want to fight. And we embrace you! Let's take the head of the propraetor. Maybe we made a mistake. - And what is it? Ask her. Go. Is this the head of the propraetor? - No, Titus Sextius has a small wound close to the lip. I am sure, I saw him several times. It is the other one. Titus Sextius had a twin. Seems he came a few days earlier from the capital. We killed him, not the propraetor. - I know. Why do you tell me things I already know? Did you know that a twin existed? - No. I did not know at all. The blue tunica mislead us. We have to make him talk, make him tell the truth. If the propraetor send his brother to be killed, if he dressed him in his clothes, and put him on the head of the caravan, it means that he knew, that he knew about your plans. The blue tunica warned him. Together, they forged a clever strategy, but to which aims? The aims of the propraetor do not interest us. His policy is not ours. We don't intrigue in politics. - So what do we do then? - War. We make war! Then, let's swear! - What do you propose? - We go away. - Let's strike the tents. - No, stop! The Romans will burn it down. - They will not burn it down. We will leave the boys and some women. They will kill them. - Sure, they will kill them. And the Numidian soldiers will kill the Numidian brothers. Thus the people will begin to understand that subservience towards Rome is absurd. They have to rebel, they can't continue playing the drums for the propraetor. But they shall play for themselves. As long as they don't understand that simple truth, they will always be victims. We cannot save them, but we will help them. We will let them be killed. If the propraetor makes a slaughter in this camp, he will show the real face of Rome. We need his revenge. We need him alive for this. With the alibi of his brother's murder he'll chase us through the desert. massacring innocents and out of the unjustly scattered Numidian blood will rise the hate enabling your people to rise up. Not always do the just come from heaven. - Maybe, but they are with him. - I am not. - We leave. We renounce the oath. Go, if you want to, but you have sworn. and maybe, we will kill you. We cannot but stay. And now, let's give the choice to the chance. Yours is the task to choose the victims. The Romans joined the camp of our brothers. And you do not feel responsible? - I do. Why do you always lie, who taught you so? Because you create an atmosphere of fear, it is difficult to say the truth. Liar! Caesar and the Romans create the fear, not us. We want to transform the fear into the people's courage. The soldiers are leaving. They arrived very quickly. Was it you who informed them? Well done. Thanks to you the propraetor did not lose time. It is not true. I am with you, believe me. Enough now with the double-cross! You have to make a decision. Be with us or against us. People like you should be eliminated. Leave me! Leave me, I want to die, this you can believe me. This dagger is beautiful. Do you want to give it to me? Give it to me. It has to use for anybody. Are you ready to swear to never again betray us, and will be with us, always? - I am ready. Show us that you are with the Numidians! - Swear! - I swear! - Again. Once again! - I swear! - Come with us. - Do you want to kill us? No, we want to offer you a possibility, to see how the Caesar's Romans civilize the conquered provinces As you see, it is not difficult to get into his residence. Blue Tunica did a good job, many soldiers are already on our side. I believe that by now we can have complete confidence in him. Do you see? Look at him. It was me who sent him. I recommended him to show himself to the propraetor. If he doesn't suspect him, arrests him, it is proof to our favour. With his help, we can get in here whenever we want. Be careful! We have to hide ourselves. These soldiers are the only ones that stayed faithful to him. It is his personal guard. Also you betrayed me. You moved over to the rebels. You are wrong. Those like you, Caesar's Romans, only see the surface. No! Don't kill him! It is not necessary anymore. Caesar died in Rome, judged. Caesar is dead! The tyrant is dead! Let's tear it down! No, it would be a mistake. We must never feel ashamed of our past. Maybe also we have faults. A man can be mistaken. But the Roman people must not be wrong, never. Let's keep it to remember him. and let's all swear to never repeat his faults. The companions first cry, but will laugh afterwards. Life leads the serious man through diversely tangled paths. Often is the quick advancing hindered. Then, the road becomes straight again. Sometimes, the strong feeling can unload itself in eloquent words, and the heavy burden of knowledge has to close up in the silence. but if two mortals are united, they will break the iron and bronze chains. Today a new life begins... Could we be all together? - Yes! We don't have the same ideas, but could we stay together also with different opinions? We had different lives, different experiences, could we build a common future? When problems show up, and difficulty, would we know to overcome them together? Long live my friend, our leader! Crowns serve to create myths, and myths serve to divide people. And the people who are friends, instead of uniting against the true enemies, divide and fight among each other in the name of someone whose vanity wants them to be unequal and divided. The crowned heads of the mercenaries kill the unity and break the links of friendship. That morning, I was in the Senate. I saw Caesar arrive. He was in a good mood. He made fun of Spurinna and insulting him as wrong seer he said that the Ides of March had come and he was, despite the prediction, still alive. But the Ides of March had come and were not yet gone, and suddenly... You have seen him... die? Yes, I saw him. He cried. He was vile. He asked for mercy. All tyrants end like this - crying. The simple man laughs about the death of a tyrant, and does the tyrant cry about the death of his simple men? But the wise prince can cross the burning river three times and he will always come back without crying nor laughing. Keep still! I don't like your philosophy. Can I embrace my women one more time? Can he embrace them? It's ok. Hurry up. We are the disciples of Brutus. We are the descendants of the Republic. We are against violence and tyranny, always. And we will see that nobody takes the place of Caesar. This is our task, not the words. You are right. Words... serve to cover the truth, and tyrants use them to convince the people, to make themselves be loved and the poor love them because they have nothing else and are afraid, because they need myths. It is those poor that we have to address, and to teach that they can live more happily without dictators. My friends. Would you be ready to kill an enemy? - Yes! What strange contradictions! Look, we put here a sack, we stab it, as they stabbed Caesar in the Senate. We do symbolism. And from this sack comes fresh, pure grain. Grain that Caesar sent the Numidians. A personal gift by the father of the fatherland to his subjects. What beautiful words! You, do you agree with him? I do not agree. And I should kill him. Can I speak? We have the luck to have with us the symbol of the tyranny of this province. But to judge this man we must be wise and mature. It's worthless to talk about his guilt, we know it. We have to decide if to kill him or bring him alive to Rome. I am for his death! - So am I! But I suggest to bring him to Rome and deliver him to the new republic's tribunal. Can I speak? I personally believe that cages and prisons should be empty. No one should inhabit them. And no one should have the right to put a man into there. This man let me pass one day. He could have killed me. But he didn't. Therefore I suggest to let him go by foot, alone. If he is able to reach the sea, he will find someone to save him. If he dies before, we will not cry for him. What do you think, how much does a human life cost? What do you think, how much does it cost? Let him be. I'll take care of him. What are you doing, friend? What are you doing, chief? You were a simple boy, one who decided to fight openly and now you have fits of rage. Also he began like this - Caesar! Because of this we left Rome. Caesar was convinced that he was always right and so he took Rome in his hands, without respecting the others. - As long as you have not decided with clarity about me, I prefer to stay in here. The only secure place for me is the prison. A sword! In the heart of the melting pot different forces mingle. And the weak, in their long winter sleep, cross the borders of the ices and unite with the strong people. Where there is no antagonism, there is no strength. Where there is no contradiction, there is no life. The wise knows that without enemies.. one cannot create friendship. Now I am your prisoner. But I don't believe to be a prisoner. We are alone now. Let them pass. I have not told yet that Rome gave me a message for the opposition leader. - Are you - the leader? - No. It's not true, you are the leader. Give me that. Dear lost friends! I bring a message from the Senate of Rome. It is for you. I came back to observe you while you are listening. Romans of Numidia! We know that among you is a young man whose father was born in Turi and was son of Gaius Octavius, man of great name and wealth. He was born on September 20 under the consulate of Marcus Tullius Cicero and Caius Antonius in Rome shortly before dawn in the Palatine district. One says this young man has himself called Octavius. But his real name is Octavian. Caesar's testament was read by Marc Anton in Rome. and was approved by the friends and enemies of the father of the fatherland. According to the will of Caesar, Octavian will be his successor and inherit his personal and official wealth. From this moment on, your name is Gaius Caesar Octavian and you will take on your shoulders the destiny of Rome. I cannot decide. Until this moment, I lived with friends. And the decision of one has always been the decision of all. But now you are Caesar and your authority is limitless. Impossible! I only accept if I can return to Rome with my friends to discuss all the problems with them, as we discuss them down here. I am not allowed to. The orders are to bring you to Rome alone. Then I refuse! I want to tell Rome that Octavian does not want Caesar's collar and inheritance. I cannot do this. I must return with you or kill myself. These are the orders. - Orders for me? Kill yourself then. What do you wait for? Around here, we have never seen a senator die. This is how true Romans know to die. Who do not aspire for money, for supremacy, but for real greatness. I personally confess that I forgot this. But this man reminded me that I, too, have to die like a true and noble Roman. Maybe they were our enemies but certainly we owe them respect. You really a rhetoric people. For you a spectacular death is more important than a just life. But for us, the poor, life is more precious, the only thing we have and we have to keep it. And you? You son of the sun and the moon? Show these barbarian Romans that we, the savages, have the power of life. Don't thank us. Propraetor, I am at your disposal. In the name of the Senate and the Roman people, it is ordered to execute Juba, leader of the rebels, and outlaw of Numidia. He is no outlaw, he is a friend. The Senate and the Roman people have decided thus. And also the new Caesar should respect these decisions. Carry out the orders. The wise knows that only one dies who does not have ideas for living. But ideas are not enough, they have no spades. Only with them can one renew life. Now, you will have all the spades of Rome and forget our common ideas. Know that I will never offer my spade to you, Caesar. But don't want to be one sole Caesar. Also you have inherited, with me, this crown. What are you organizing? There must be someone who put this idea into your head. I know the people here well. They always say the sun made them lose their mind. Let's see if this is true. Run! To the right! Stand still! Walk. To the left. Put the arms up! Go! Now bend down! You know, we have the proof. We know perfectly what you have in mind. Stand up! Come back here! You want to kill Octavian. You decided to do it today, when he meets with the senators. It is true or not? Who are your complices? Speak! Who gave you the orders? There are ways to make you talk. Now you don't move. Let him be! Have a rest. Sit down. Let us offer him something to eat. But why? You were always with us. Close to us. Why do you know want to kill your friend Octavian? Why? Who suggested you this idea? Juba? I beg your pardon. Your friend has something interesting to say to you. Speak free. - He received money from someone. - From whom? Do I have to say his name? - No. Not his name. Was it a Roman who gave him the money? And for what reason? To kill Octavian. Did you see when they gave him the money? - No. But I know he took it. Salute, friends. Why don't you say clearly that I am organizing a plot against Octavian? Dou you want to show this? Come on, I am at your disposal here. You financed the Numidian outlaws, and are accused of treason, and a conspiracy against the new Caesar. Tie him. You are delayed, Romans. You have to die, all of you. Here too much politics has been done. Assassinations and culprits have been chosen before thinking of just ideas. I want to try to force history! I will kill you, Octavian, and take your position. There will be no witness to unmask me. Go, Romans! Run! The Numidian barbarians will follow you everywhere. We can get away. - Look! These young rebels aren't very serious. What does Claudius want then? Maybe he does not know it himself. He comes, goes, threatens to kill us, then embraces us, then hates us again. Every day he suggests another strategy, maybe we did wrong to trust him. Young ones are all like this. It is our fault. Afraid of being considered old, we listen to them, ready to give them their heritage. We are enchanted to listen to them and these boys loose their heads. And thus, instead of becoming adult, they play with life. You are too indulgent. You judge them too tenderly. The problem is much easier. Those boys have no sense of responsibility and even less of duty. You know nothing about the young. Claudius, he is the true representative of the youth! He changes every day the resolution, but because he understood that for us young there is no way out. If we seek to take the power, we will make the same errors as our fathers. If we don't take it, we will suffocate in the errors of others. There is only one solution. Never think. Be grey men. But who has not a grey character, what can he do? I am not a grey man. And still I had a clear mind since I was young. I always knew what I had to do. But I realized myself, day for day, struggling, suffering. Your aim was always very simple. For you, the only problem is to serve the one who has the power. Now, for example, you are with us because you understood Octavian will be a great one. You are already ready to negate what you did so far, and tomorrow you would be able to change again. I am not a patrician like you. I have to earn my living. If the situation changes, nothing remains for me but to adapt to the new situation. This we understood well. We know, for example, that the idea of assassinating Octavian was yours. You wanted to show the new Caesar that his current friends will become future enemies. You wanted him to see that you will be indispensable. To secure the order for him tomorrow and his personal safety. Indeed, it is an old rule which you perfectly know. Who ascends, has to leave everything behind. Even the honesty. I hope that Octavian will go without people like you. He is coming back! We have understood that we have to die. Come! Do you want to kill us? Do you want to take my place? I, a damned character, can only be in opposition. What are your ideas? What is your programme as a future Caesar? In Rome, I was called to build a destiny. I know that my enemies need my name and not my personality. But I want to bring our ideas to Rome and fulfil a renewal without conflicts. I believe that to realize a more just world one needs authority and discipline. Not the authority that oppresses, but an authority that leads people towards horizons, that are maybe more limited, but more human. You became wise. It was enough to put a crown on your head for you to feel responsible for the Roman people. You already changed your attitude. You speak of "lead", "authority", of "discipline". You speak of "constructing" but you know well that before one must destroy. Without hate there can be no love. And your ideas are illusions, which you use to cover your ambitions. Don't you believe, Claudius, that the world can improve? - No. I believe that it has to change. I wanted to propose you to come with me. To be at my side. To help me not to forget the aims which we set for ourselves. You know well you are forcing me to refuse. You know my ideas. You know I don't believe in gradual progressions but in violent changes, those that come suddenly, as natural disasters. Why do you call me to renounce my ideas? Why? Lost friend, you are already Caesar! I hoped you could reflect upon a simple thing. If I don't become Caesar, it will be someone else who is worse than myself. Is this not a valid reason? You want to be a just Caesar, I dream of a world without Caesars! Come. Practical men made the world. I hope that you will be our just Caesar. Our virtues depend on the interpretation of the moment. And power, infatuated by itself, has no more certain tomb than the chair on which it stands to vaunt itself with its deeds. A fire chases another fire. A nail chases another nail. The rights destroy the rights. Strength kills strength. Go, Octavian, go, Romans! Rome will be yours! And when you will be in power, you will already be weak. And one day you will fall into the hands of the disciples of a Claudius. You must know that the just are immortal. Subtitling: Leonardo Costadura and Gary Vanisian
