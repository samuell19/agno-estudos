The Church of St. Paul, built more than 400 years ago, is the most famous historical site in Malacca. Once you step inside, you immediately feel its mysterious atmosphere. Leaning on both sides are the tombstones of 28 Dutch missionaries and below lie their corpses. In the center of this ruin is the tomb of archbishop, St. Francis Xavier. Worshipers come from all over to toss coins against the tombs for good luck. Rumor has it that a man once stole these coins, but he turned mad after and drowned himself in the strait of Malacca. The largest tomb is the most disturbing. Located next to the church, it holds the bodies of seven people, including Mr. and Mrs. Evans and their five babies. They all died of plague. It's believed that when night falls, the five children will crawl out of their grave, break into homes and kill people. Maybe stab a sleeping man to death. You should never say you don't believe in evil legends. This is for you! How did you get in? You're so careless, you left the keys in the door! Give it back! Who pissed you off ? Did you see the film you shot in Malacca? The film? I saw it this morning. It's great! Great? Yeah, the scenery is great. But I want supernatural films, not just films with scenery. -It's irritating! -Come on, you're overreacting. Now, have a drink! What's this? You bought a new antique? Give it back to me. You're so rough. This gold Buddha is very precious. I don't see anything special! Nothing special? What do you know? You only know how to shoot scenery and never do any research! Okay, okay! What's so special about this Buddha? What's so special about it? There's a stone coffin in Malaysia where in 1919 there was a... I know! There was a Red Dwarf Ghost! I'm surprised you know this! Of course, being with you so long, I've learned a little. Oh, so you're showing off? And, what's more, I know how to lure a man. Okay, stop it, we're flying to Malaysia tomorrow morning. We? I didn't say I was going. What's wrong? Why don't you say anything? You're being difficult again. Quit it or I'll fire you. You wouldn't dare. Hello? Boss! It's time to go to the airport. We're here! Get out and grab the equipment! Don't leave anything behind. -Hand me the tripod. -Here! Be careful! -Chai! -What? Look at all the Taoist amulets on this tree! It looks evil! Watch your words or you'll pay! I think this is the place. Stephen, it looks really scary down there. Bullshit! See, “Whoever Enters Dies”! We better not go! There's nothing to be afraid of. Chai! -Yes, boss? -You know the drill. Yes boss, I got it. Ok! Hung! Chow! Set up the equipment! Ok! No, you can't go down there. Remember, pan slowly to the bulletin board. Stella, get ready! Camera! We're outside the mysterious tomb of the Red Dwarf Ghost. In 1919, a dwarf sorcerer practiced some of the most evil sorcery down there! He was later killed by four righteous sorcerers! Before he died, he cast an evil spell, swearing to become a vengeful ghost. Anyone who had touched, hurt or even made fun of him would die. Cut! OK'! Stephen, anyone who hurt him would die? Isn't that a little extreme? Stella, the book said, four righteous sorcerers all died after. Boss, money won't work on him. You can't even handle one small job. Fine. I'll distract him, while you guys go down. When you get down there, don't stop shooting and be sure to open the coffin. Let's get ready. -Hey Uncle! -What is it? -How much to shoot down there? -No, money isn't the problem. -Come on, please? -You can't go down! -Let us go! -No, you can't! You can't! It won't take long. -It's dangerous! No! -Come on, help us out! Hey! What are you doing? Get out of there! Uncle, we're sorry! We're sorry! Who said you can shoot down there? Pack up, we're leaving! It's such a bummer we can't film anymore. -Without him, everything would've been perfect! -Yeah. -So what's next? -Work's over. Go find a woman. Really? Sir, are you going back to the city? Can you give me a ride? -You're off so early? -Yeah, it's late. No one will work here at night. -Really? Get in! -Thanks! -Uncle, sit here! -Thank you! Pm so lucky I met you today! Boss, be careful! -Hand me the lantern. -Okay. Wow, it's terrifying! Stephen! It's locked! -Chai, break it open with something! -Alright. -You're not afraid of the curse? -Why should I be? I have to pee. Piss off then! Thanks, now I need to piss too. Excuse me, I'm going to pee here. -Hey, did you say excuse me? -Get in my way and I"ll pee on you! Don't bullshit, you idiot! You're the idiot! Chai? Chai? I'm taking a piss here! The stone coffin is here. -Come in, and bring the equipment. -Okay. It's freezing cold in here! This place is huge! It's evil! Stop scaring me! Cut the bullshit! Set up the equipment! -I'm scared. -There's nothing to fear. -Chai, help me open the coffin! -Okay. Lights on! Attention everyone! No matter what happens, keep the camera rolling. Don't ever stop. -Got it! -Got it! Keep filming! Keep filming! Go! Go! Closer! Closer! Closer! A little closer! A little closer! A little closer! Closer! A little closer! Closer! Closer! Push in slowly! Get a clear shot! Action! The mysterious stone coffin is open and the flesh of the Red Dwarf Sorcerer has vaporized into a red smoke. Only his skeleton remains inside the coffin now. Ok, at last, I finally got it. We can pack up and go! Stella, I'll go back to Hong Kong tomorrow. I'll launch a press tour with our incredible footage! It'll be big! What about me? You go to the longhouse in Borneo. Take everyone on holiday for two weeks, and shoot some good footage as well. This is a tributary of the Le yang River! The river runs fast and fish are common, so boats often get overturned. You can see longhouses on both sides. You've actually come at the right time, the Iban natives are celebrating their new year and they're excited about it. Each longhouse is decorated with colorful flags and filled with bamboo flowers! Once the bamboo flute is blown, the ceremony begins. Gongs and drums echo in the sky and it becomes quite festive! Some follow the monotonous music and do a primitive dance. How fun it is! But don't be fooled by their smiles, their ancestors were all cannibals. They once decapitated people and poured their homemade wine into the skulls to drink with the blood. How terrifying! When finished, they dried the heads under the sun and hung them on their doors as decoration. Isn't it horrible? Bowls line the floor for their New Year's party. Offerings include wild boar meat, eggs and rice. Each longhouse is about 300 yards long, housing up to 30 families. It's a primitive life. Things like exorcisms and spells happen here. Things beyond evil and your wildest imagination can happen at any time. For New Year's, sorcerers visit families to help expel evil spirits or demons. Just like what Taoist priests and monks do for you. So, we must be careful! Hey! The Master of the longhouse has lined up his most beautiful girls for you! Welcome! Be careful. This is the house master, Dairoma. -Hello. -Hello, Dairoma! -This is my wife. -Hello! Hello! My son, Rumbang. -Hello. -Hello. -These Iban girls are beautiful. -Yes! Trial marriage is very popular here. I heard you can try for three nights. If you're not satisfied with one girl, try another! It's best to try them all. -Could you even handle that? -Of course! -And don't worry, there's no herpes here. -Really? Seriously? Behave yourselves! Blessing guests with a chicken is a welcoming ritual. In this honorable ceremony, the master will give you a spear. Me? And you'll kill a wild boar, symbolizing the death of the plague God. And this act will bring you good luck forever! If a woman offers flowers and a drink, you must accept or she'll be unhappy. Thank you! This way. This dance is to welcome honorable guests. If they invite you to dance, you must accept. They dance very well! Hey! Miss! Thank you! -Good morning! -Good morning! Amei! Huh? Boss! You said you'd be a week, but you're back so soon! Process these film negatives for me. Also, ask Michael from publicity to see me at ten o'clock. Okay! Hmm, why is he so nervous? This is the Fire God dance! They dance well! The Sorcerer has arrived, this way please! Ms. Lok, let me introduce you to the Sorcerer of our longhouse. Hello! Um... It's a pleasure to meet you. The pleasure is mine. Ms. Lok, may I take a look at your hand? My hand? Alright! Our sorcerer can predict a person's future. Then please tell me mine! Ms. Lok, I see a red birth mark on your back. Yes, you're right! You're really talented. I did nothing. I just read it from your palm print. -Ms. Lok, shall we dance? -Sure. Rumbang, how can we tell which girls are single? -Do they meet us in a yellow-lit room? -Can we pick who we want? -No, you can't choose -How then? Just try your luck! Go to hell! It's better not to marry to avoid all the trouble. Rumbang, go dance! Go on, go! You're the host! Alright, alright. Go! -Ms. Lok, may we dance? -No, thanks! Don't be shy, give it a try! Chai, let's go! Hey miss, where are you from? Hong Kong! I heard Hong Kong women are very beautiful. Pervert! -So, do you see any lit houses? -Nothing! Hey! Do you see that? -Look there! -Where? There's a room with a light on! What luck! That should be it! Hey, woah! Where are you going in a hurry? Get back here! I should be first! -Why's that? -Because I'm stronger than you. So of course I should go first! That has nothing to do with anything! You're young and less experienced. Watch and learn! I"m a Chinese local from here, but I've been overseas to study. Ah, you're the town bumpkin. No wonder you're eyeing foreign women. Monster! Huh? Herpes? -No, it's a monster! -Fuck you! You filthy thief! -Did you steal from me? -No, I didn't! I didn't! Tell me why you're here or I'll hack you to death! -I'm here for the trial marriage! -What? Trial marriage! Trial marriage? Why didn't you say so? I'll let you try! From top to bottom, you can try whatever you like! Sorry! Sorry! Don't go! If you leave, I'll be so embarrassed. -It'll take another decade for someone to try me. -I don't care! I can't stand it! -Come in! Come in! -You can find another! Bye-bye! What do you do for work? I was sent by the Sarawak development department. -To develop the longhouse? -Yes. Woah! Wait! We're friends. You're really gonna leave me here? That's not right! Why don't we go together? Okay, let's go! Come on, hurry up! Don't look for any old ladies again. I'll go to that house. See you later! I'm not here for a trial marriage! I'm here to take a pee. Just here to take a pee! I want to pee. No...no...don't! Oh shit, why me? -Come again tonight, don't forget! - I will, bye-bye! Bye-bye! Ah Hung! Ah Hung! I scored big! She was moaning: "Mmm, I want it!" Are you out of your mind? You're crazy to hang those things around your neck. She gave them to me. God, that chick was amazing. She told me to come again tonight! You do know we have work this morning right? Where's Ah Chow? Huh? Ah Chow? He never came back? Ahhh, he must be sleeping. I'll go get him! Good morning! Good morning! Starting to work already? It's early! Yeah, we're on holiday, but we still need to shoot some footage. -Can I show you around? -Sure! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Ah Chow's missing! You guys play too much! Are you two stupid? What's wrong? Ah Chow, he's gone! Ah Chow's gone? How come? Hurry! Come on! Right up there, hurry! He went in this house and I went to that one. Let's check inside. What the? There's nothing here, but this is the house! Cut it out! Go look for him! Stella, is this not... Yes! That's Ah Chow! He must be around here then. I told you! He was here last night! What are you doing here? Sir, we're just looking for our friend. Nobody lives here. The house is empty. All the people who lived here before have passed away. Please leave now. Ah Chow! Ah Chow! This is weird. Why were the house lights on all night if no one lives there? Could there be a ghost ? Yeah, maybe the girl you were with was a ghost too! Cut the shit! Let's find Ah Chow! Ah Chow! Ah Chow! Ah Chow! -Still haven't found him? -No, can't find him. Ahh! It's Ah Chow! Hey, look down there! Don't come any closer! Chai, go get the house Master! The producer boasts about this footage, but I heard there's nothing but red smoke. -We'll see soon. -Why's he so late? -Hi! -Hi! -Everyone here? -Everyone's here. Play it, please! In 1919, a dwarf sorcerer practiced the most vicious witchcraft down there. He was later killed by four righteous sorcerers. Before he died, he cast an evil spell, swearing to become a vengeful ghost to kill anyone who had touched, hurt or even made fun of him. What? I thought it was only red smoke! What's this? Yeah, this isn't funny! The spirit's right there on tape! -This'll be worth a fortune! -Yeah! We're lucky! The mysterious stone coffin is now open! -This film will get a lot of publicity. -It'll definitely sell. We can do more promotion to boost sales and get extra attention! What do you think ? Amei! Ask him to play it again, I'd like to watch it again. Sure. Roll it again! Watch carefully. In 1919, a dwarf sorcerer practiced the most vicious witchcraft down there. Stella and the crew are at the longhouse. Get them back here quick. There's so many longhouses in Borneo... How exactly do I find them? Just try your best. Start zooming in from here! All the footage of the red smoke and ghost. You better go back to Hong Kong. I don't think you should stay. I'm not going back. It's only been two days since you arrived and two people are dead, don't you think this place is dangerous? That's why I can't leave. How can I report on everything if I leave? I need to stay and find the killer. The longhouse is too rural, how can you find the murderer? Plus, you're an outsider here. It'll be difficult for you to communicate with the people here. And what could you do if you actually found the murderer? Go home. You're a development officer. You can help me. It won't be hard if you help. I must find who killed them! Calm down. Keep your emotions inside when we see the Master. Remember to smile. Cheers! Cheers! Even though I don't speak their language, they're very kind to me. That's right. Despite this place being primitive, the people are very kind. You're right! Really, we have a good thing here. We do hope that you enjoy our longhouse. This is our homemade white wine, please have a sip. -Cheers! -Cheers! Uhh, excuse me, Master... Oh, this is their custom. If you don't drink it, they'll be upset. Just take a small sip. Here, cheers! Satali! Bring some more wine over! You probably heard that two of my colleagues have died. We're sorry we couldn't protect them. We're truly sorry. It's not your fault. But could you help us find the murderer? No problem! My son, Rumbang, will help you with this. Thank you so much! Dad! Help! Rumbang! Rumbang, please don't blame me for this. If I didn't cut your arm off, you'd be poisoned to death! -Go away! I... I didn't mean it... Rumbang, hang in there! You'll be alright! I'll get you some medicine. Come on, be careful! Hang in there! Watch your step! Who is it? Coming! Ms. Lok. Hi Sorcerer, what's wrong? How can I help? Don't be afraid. There have been a lot of venomous scorpions around recently. I've come to give you this peace mask to protect you. Thank you, you're so kind! This peace mask will protect you from danger. -Please keep it close. -Okay. Thank you so much, Sorcerer. I appreciate your help. -Goodnight! -Goodnight! Who was that? The Sorcerer brought this. Here you go. I'm going to sleep. Ugly mask! Sorcerer, who cast the scorpion spell? The scorpion spell? Have you seen any scorpions? Not only have I seen them, but they nearly killed my son! The sign of scorpions means disaster is coming! Two of the foreigners have already been killed. This is a bad omen. Who do you suspect? It must be Stella! She threw the scorpion on my son! No, it can't be her. She's only been here two days. Even if the spell was put on her, it wouldn't have worked so fast. Who else was at the party? Oh! The maid, Satali! Then it must be her! We'll offer her as a sacrifice to our God. Let God handle it. What are they doing? It's an offering ceremony to their God. Drag the witch out! Yes sir! No! No! Please! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! They're so cruel! This is their custom. They sacrifice innocent people as offerings to their god. This is inhuman! Let me go! Help me! Help me! Help me! Get her on the altar! Prepare her for the offering! Master, how can you be so cruel to use her as a sacrifice? Cruel? Isn't trying to kill my son with a scorpion more cruel? Begin the ceremony! Sacrificing her is what everyone wants. Master, they are uneducated and superstitious! You don't need to listen to them! It's what my people wish. I only do this sacrifice on their behalf. The scorching sun will kill her! Once the heavenly bird flies up, she'll be dead. How can we find her in the dark? Who knows if she's still here. She must be here. I don't think God took her. -See that? She's lying there! -Wait for me! Girl, wake up! Satali, wake up! Water... Wake up! Water... -Let's get her back now! -Okay! Dad, Please release Satali now! No. Why would I do that? She has the scorpion spell. Once the heavenly bird flies up, she'll be dead. The way she suffered in the sun today, she's definitely dead. I can't change my decision. This is the tradition of the Iban people. Come on! Who's that? Satali, you're still alive! You! You release her now! This will anger our God! Get over here! No! Get over here now! -No. -Get over here! Stop! It may be your custom to offer her to your God, But how can you beat her like this? This is against human rights! How dare you! I'm the Master of this place! -Rumbang! -Rumbang! Don't be like your ignorant father. You're educated and leading a new generation here. You should know this is wrong! We live in a law-abiding society. Hung, let's go! -Who is it? -It's me! Hold on! Too bad. Just hold on a bit longer. Hi! I was taking a bath. Sorry to keep you waiting so long. So, aren't you gonna invite me in? Come on in. I've taken care of the bodies of your dead colleagues. If there's nothing else for you here, you should go back to Hong Kong. There's no telephone here. It'll take days to reach the city, so no one will know what's happening. The people here are growing more savage. They used to sacrifice people to their God, but how can they continue to do that nowadays? Chai and Ah Chow died mysteriously. How can I explain that to their families? Please, don't cry. Don't cry. Stella! Stella, are you okay? Stella! Stella! Stella! Stella! Stella! What happened? Are you okay? Uncle, I think the Sorcerer's lying. If Satali has the scorpion spell, then why didn't she die at the altar? I told you it wasn't Satali. I think it's the woman from Hong Kong. Come on, there's no need to guess! Uncle, can't you talk to spirits? Why not ask the spirits directly? That's a good a idea. Your aunt used to cast scorpion spells before she died. I'll conjure her for advice, but we must laugh to conjure her. Aunt, tell us who cast the spell. Get me a chicken! Satali is not the spellcaster! It's Ms. Lok! I heard someone call for help in a house last night! Scorpions! Scorpions have killed them all! It's horrible! There's blood everywhere! Stella! Mr. Liu, there's no reason to keep talking. I know what's going on, but there's nothing I can do. Please, go away. Sorcerer, Stella's in grave danger. She's gonna be fine. I gave her a peace mask to ward off evil spirits. Those evil spirits can't hurt her for now. You're a local, but they still tortured you. Why? I don't know... There's never been so many strange happenings like this before. Many people have died and the scorpions keep showing up. Is the God offering over with? Yeah, it's finished now. But I still don't know why I was involved. It's so strange... -Could this be about the stone coffin? -Ms. Lok, what stone coffin? Oh, nothing! Let's go. It's a cockfight! Let's have a look! Why did the chickens stop fighting? What's that? Scorpions! Get back! Hey, go get the girl, don't let her escape! I'll inform Master Dairoma! Sorcerer, Sorcerer! Stop asking for my help. There's nothing I can do. Please go! Sorcerer! If anything happens to Ms. Lok, come find me. Mr. Liu! Mr. Liu! -What's wrong? -Stella's terrified! There's many scorpions! Sorcerer! Where is she now? She was near the cockfight ring when she ran away. She might be over there, I'll go look! -Go now! -Okay! There they are! Get them! -They're coming for us, what should we do? -Go ashore! Stop running! Get them, now! Get them! Now you can see I'm not lying! He's always with the witch! If they're together, it means more disaster! Get them! What do you want? That bitch Stella has killed so many! Give her up now! -I'll kill her with my own hands. -Dairoma, do you respect the law? The law? Shut up and listen carefully, I'm the Master here! My blade is the law! People like you don't deserve to be House Master! Son of a bitch, listen! Even if you won't tell me where she is, I'll find her! I'll catch her and use her as an offering! I'm not afraid of you! Even if the law is on your side! Sue me if you want! Let's go! -I saw her over here! -Where could she be? There she is! Get her! Stop! Come on! In the water, get her! Don't let her get away! You! Stop! Stop! You can't get away! It's over! Get back! There are scorpions! Look! Look! She has scorpions on her! Yes boss, what is it? Did you contact Stella? I tried my best. I even tried the consulate, but there's no news of her. -Keep trying. -Okay. -Also, has the film been zoomed in yet? -Yes, they just finished. Tell the editing staff I'm coming to watch it. Huh? Nothing here. Why is it here again? What's wrong with the machine? Is it broken? Why won't it stop? Why can't this machine stop? Stop! Stop! Why can't it be stopped? Boss? Boss! Boss? My hand's trapped on the machine! Boss! Boss, open the door! Boss, open the door! Open the door! Boss! Boss! Are you okay? What happened? Nothing. Where the hell has she gone? -Hey, there's some footprints! -Yeah! There's a cave. Look! There are many scorpions! Get back! Don't come in, please! Scorpions are crawling out of my body! Get out! Go! Scorpions are my biggest fear! I'm getting out of here! Hung! Hung! Get out! They'll sting you to death! Get out! Now! Mr. Liu, this is scary! Get out! Now! Let's go out first. I'll get the Sorcerer. You guard the cave. Don't let anyone in! -Where's Stella? -I don't know! -Tell me where she is! -I don't know, now let me go! -Follow me! -Yes sir! -Look! There's a cave up there! -Yeah, maybe she's in there! Follow me! Come on up, quick! -It's scary here. -Yeah, really scary. What's wrong with you? Get up here! -I can't get up! -Quick! You guys have no guts! I really can't get up! No, you can't go in! Fuck off! You evil witch! Don't come in! Don't come any closer! Get away! Get away! Get away! Dairoma's dying! Run! Stella's hiding in a cave filled with scorpions! So it finally begins... From the beginning, I know it's heaven's will. Sorcerer, I'm begging you, you must save her! She's helpless! Fox Fairy, will you help her? Being carefree doesn't guarantee freedom. It's not the Maitreya of ancient India, whose souls are far and wide beyond. Riding high on a chariot of fire, holding hammers weighing thousands of tons. Should there be savagery, look up! It'll be smashed to dust by thunderbolts! Divine spirits, please guide our path. It's the Red Dwarf Ghost? We must ask a Tibetan Priest for help! -Where's Hung? He's not back yet? -Dairoma went in, but never came out! Stella! Stay away! Don't ever come near me again! This chain will suppress the spell on you for now. Suppress the spell? Can't it be removed? It's a spell? Yes, it's the scorpion spell. Why do I have a spell on me? Twenty years ago, there was a young man from China who came here and had a trial marriage with my daughter. She became pregnant and gave birth to a girl. The three of them made a happy family and lived a nice life. Until it was revealed that the man already had a wife in China. Upon receiving a letter from his first wife, he decided to go back to China, taking nothing but my grand-daughter, and coldly abandoning his wife. My daughter was heartbroken and grief-stricken. She hated him so much. She begged me for help, asking me to activate the scorpion spell cast on him before their marriage. I was moved by her appeal, so I did it. Now, the heavens are punishing me for my mistake. You're my Grandfather! Grandfather, save me! Lama Priest, you've seen my film now. Why does this ghost only appear in the film? It wasn't there in person. That's the Red Dwarf Ghost. Whoever offends him will die by his hand. Now you and everyone at the longhouse are in grave danger. Priest, please help us! The Red Dwarf Ghost was sealed in a stone coffin for practicing evil spells with a gold Buddha. The gold Buddha's been missing ever since. I'm surprised you have it now. If the Red Dwarf Ghost and gold Buddha unite, he'll become the devil and no one can stop him then. What should I do? Find a Tibetan Priest and ask him to grant you a blue robe for protection. It'll be able to ward off the ghost. A solemn mind takes decades, with red lotus flowers blossoming below me. How grand the crown of Buddha is. The bottle of heavenly dew mine. Mercy is granted no matter what. Buddha saves all who are drowning. As the holy dew spreads, all filth is swept away. The palms of Buddha turn into lotuses! Hands pose in the Samadhi Stance! Finger sword points to Heaven! Divine gods, manifest yourselves! Only those who practice Buddhism can see me chanting prayers. Once everyone pays back for their karma, they can go to paradise. Keep this blue robe on until the Red Dwarf Ghost is controlled. Failing to do so will result in your death. Mr. Liu, there's a reason why I can only suppress the spell on her. It's not because the spell can't be lifted, -but because I have to sacrifice myself to lift it. -Sacrifice yourself? -You're serious? -The spell's rooted in her red birthmark. If I lift the spell off of her, the spell will pass onto me. Besides the scorpion spell, there's the Red Dwarf Ghost. If the spell is lifted, the Red Dwarf Ghost will kill her. So we need a Tibetan Priest's help. I'll lure the Red Dwarf Ghost out by removing the spell and then the priest can control him. Now please bring me the skull of my daughter, so I can purify it and remove this spell. Sorcerer, why hasn't the Priest come yet? Stella's being tortured! He's almost here! Stella! Don't get close! Stay on the altar and protect the gold Buddha. When the Red Dwarf Ghost appears, stick the amulet onto the gold Buddha! And don't ever let the Red Dwarf Ghost take it! Or he'll get even stronger! Set the altar! Begin the purification! Stop! Mr. Liu, set me on fire! Burn these scorpions to death so they'll never kill again! Light me up! Light me up! Come on! Set me on fire! Light the fire now! Let this righteous deed bless all, deliver us from evil, and lead us to paradise. Lead us all to paradise! May this righteous deed bless all, deliver us from evil, and lead us to paradise. May this righteous deed bless all, deliver us from evil, and lead us to paradise. May this righteous deed bless all, deliver us from evil, and lead us to paradise. May this righteous deed bless all, deliver us from evil, and lead us to paradise. May this righteous deed bless all, deliver us from evil, and lead us to paradise. May this righteous deed bless all, deliver us from evil, and lead us to paradise. Why doesn't anything happen? Yeah, the Red Dwarf Ghost should come out now. Stella! Come help me! -Throw your altar robes on it! -Yes! Protect the gold Buddha! Stephen! It's said that evil is always more powerful! Even if you're more powerful than me, I still have the sacred staff! You can't hurt me! You can only hurt the weak! Possess me if you're so powerful! You've fallen into my trap! Now you can never leave me! Cover the gold Buddha with the blue robe!
