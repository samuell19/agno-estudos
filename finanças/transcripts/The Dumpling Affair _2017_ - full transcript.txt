(lively-dragging music) (man dramatically) Your last hour has struck! You all stay on the ground now! You, back there! One more thing like that and I'll shoot you! She is in in a dangerous situation! (roars) I blow you all into the afterlife! I'll shoot you first! And then I blow us all up! Zefix! (beep) Colleagues, it's up to each individual. Is Barschl the spree killer again? (Barschl) Sissy or man? Oh my... Our colleague Stopfer has completely settled into his victim role. And what do you do? Show us! Drop the gun! Eberhofer? What's he doing now, huh? If I do NOT drop the gun? Mr. Barschl, we've been playing all morning. I don't like it anymore. We'll have 12 in a minute, I want a Leberkassemmel. One wrong move, and I'll blow us all up! Ah! The rampage ended. Gunman dead. Can we go home now? (rumbling) (ponderous music and bells ringing) (soft cooing) (congregation) # Bless all my thinking, # bless all my doing , # let in your blessing # ♪ Day and night let me rest ♪ (priest) Dear Lord, we pray to you. Receive the deceased into thy kingdom. and hold her in your hands. She who has been to the whole congregation and her family at all times Faithful mother and loving grandma . Give her home with you , where every pain is transformed into joy. Come to meet her with love. (woman) Amen! Shh, grandma, he's not done yet! What, it's still not ready? And grant eternal life through Christ our Lord to to Grandma Gemeinwieser beloved by all of us.... Now. Amen. Now we buy grandma a hearing aid. Grandma only hears what she likes to hear. A hearing aid won't help. (kick) Ouch! Mei, Franz! You and my grandma, you are for me the most important people in my life... have been. You, Franz? Yes, Susi? Don't you think we should really get married soon? Life can be over so quickly. Yes, but not so fast now. Your grandma turned 94. We still have a little way to go. (hard rock ringtone) Eberhofer? Oh! Yes. Coming right up. Accident resulting in death. Mei, stupid, that I have to go now of all times. But that the people always in the most inopportune moment have an accident. Hi! Susi... Goodbye, Franz! Don't let me stop you. Yes. I have a mission. (lively-dragging music) Doctor Brunnermeier? I would be there now! (Brunnermeier) Who? Franz Eberhofer. In the cellar! Oh. Don't worry, he never bites. As you can smell, Mr. Hausladen has been lying there for a few days. Apparently tripped and fell down the stairs, when he went to get some fresh beer. And who found him? - Annemarie, his daughter. Has just come home from Lourdes, a pilgrimage by bus. He made it through. Look how peaceful he looks. What is there, right? Madness. (Fly buzzing and turkey chattering) Do you actually have relatives? I don't have any more. Mom's been dead for almost ten years. Hm. Now there's only me. And the turkeys. Oh, the turkeys! Someone has to take care of the critters. Do they at least have someone that you can call? Who stands by you? Yes. (excited chattering) (doorbell) (yelping) Did that just ring? Do we have a bell? Who would ring our bell? With us you knock on the door or on the window or just come in. (doorbell) Oh, reigning times, in the middle of dinner! (growling) There would be one outside, looking for a Magdalena. Grandma's name is Magdalena. - I know that. Then he probably means grandma, right? (dreamy music) Lene? That will get you nowhere, Grandma doesn't hear anything. Paul. Lene. They seem to know each other. Yes, that was a very, very long time ago. (jeering and Bavarian polka music) # The tamper has a wish, Yes, we know exactly. # He would now like to stuff The darner's wife. (The guests laugh.) Andi, hi. Got your driver's license again? Already gone again. Greetings, Franz, you like a beer? - Absolutely. # Holladihia, holladiho, # holladihia, holladiho. # ♪ Holladihia, holladiho... ♪ Karli, why on earth did you invite that asshole? What do you think would have happened if I hadn't? Hakudampfu. I could be on traffic duty starting tomorrow. Barschl is the worst nitpicker we've ever had. He does nothing but spy on you spying on you all day. How does Barschl get a woman like that? - A Russian. Yes, from what one hears. Someone like that is sure to come out of a catalog. # . . .holladihia, holladiho. (jeering and clapping) (softly) Shit. Another beer and schnapps, please. For me too, please. - Yes, me too, please. Three schnapps, three beers. (cutting noise) (splashing) Wedding: Stopfer, Karl. 9:45 p.m. Aschenbrenner: 5 beers, 3 schnapps, Fux: 4 beers, 5 schnapps, Hipp: 3 beer, 3 schnapps. The Riedl has 5 quarts of white wine, so a whole liter. Barschl. Are we spying on colleagues again, ha? (splashing) Oh my! Have I now destroyed important information? Ah, I'm so sorry. Sorry. That's Mr. Barschl to you. And that's what I want to hear now. Excuse me, Mr. Barschl. Now kiss my ass, Barschl. That's all right, Eberhofer. See you around... (groan) (rattling) (quietly) Boah. (slow polka music) Someday I'll get you, Barschl, right? And then you belong to the cat! And that won't take long. What a stupid pig! (Sniffing) Christ, who has my knife now? Oh, fuck you all. (fast polka music and jeering) (all) Five, four, three, two, one... (jeering) (honking) General driver's license and vehicle inspection . Do we agree with an alcohol test? Are you out of your mind, Barschl? At a wedding among colleagues? Driver's license and vehicle documents. Mr. Barschl, I'm sorry. If I had known... There. And now Mr. Barschl will stop the alcohol control among colleagues. Eberhofer, you already know what you're doing, don't you? That's bye-bye police career. Or just bye-bye Barschl. You don't have the balls. We'll see about that. (spaghetti western music) Colleagues? I'm only doing this to de-escalate, OK? Now move the car. But soon. And I'll tell you one thing, Eberhofer. There'll be consequences, you little tattletale. Once again I won't close my eyes. Did you...? (horns) (Barschl) Who honked the horn? (ponderous brass band music) (clacking) (whimpering) Eberhofer! Wake up! (Grandma) Have you all gone crazy? Please leave my boy in peace! Leave that alone! This is a police operation! Tell me, do you have to make such a circus? Franz Eberhofer, You're under temporary arrest. - Really? Aha. (whimpering) Groan. (lively music) Franz, now pull yourself together! Thin Lizzy leads the investigation. What? The rock band from the '70s? What kind of rock band? Tell me, Kalli, why am I even here? Ah. Greetings, Mr. Eberhofer. Elisabeth Maierhofer, LKA Munich, internal investigations. Ah, I see. You're Thin Lizzy. And you smell kind of strong. - Sorry, it's my own fault. Who got me out of bed? Could it be, that we have a drinking problem? I don't know about you. I don't. Does that sound familiar? - Great. I missed that. Merci... - This is an important piece of evidence. It's about murder. Ha! Kiss my ass! It looks like Barschl but he looks like he's in the shit. That would be an appropriate formulation for your current situation. Your name on the murder weapon. All that's missing is a bow around it. Still funny? But you don't seriously believe now, that I killed Barschl? "Someday I'll catch Barschl, right? And then you'll belong to the cat!" "And that won't take long." That is the statement of colleague Fux. He confirms that you threatened Barschl with your service weapon yesterday. Is that true? Yes... "threatened." We just had different opinion. Where were you between three and four in the morning? - In bed. Alone? - No, with Ludwig. Is that your partner? - Well, my dog. Your ID and service weapon, please. - It wasn't. Your ID and service weapon. (slow music) He's done something neat again, your fiancé. I wouldn't have believed him capable of murder. That can't be true. Franz would never kill anyone. Yes, yes. Hope dies last, dear Miss Susi. But let me tell you something. You are still reasonably young. There is still something. You'll find another one. Even with us people are getting divorced now. There is always someone free. We have heard that Eberhofer had a history of violence? What does violent mean? You are not allowed to pull a beer mug over anyone's head today, already you are ready for violence. Please! Have you experienced the killer cop Eberhofer as being ready for violence? If you don't stop spreading lies about my Franzl, then you could experience something, I tell you! (Fly buzzing) The boy has a heart of gold! I know Eberhofers, they do not hurt a fly. Bastards! Hm... That's a squashed butterfly on the windshield. That's easy. This is a strongly burnt Kaiserschmarrn with a plum compote. Ah no, those are cherries. Don't you want to get get a lawyer? I don't need a lawyer, because I'm innocent. What do you have there? - Your personnel file. It makes you dizzy, when you read it. Small excerpt from your psychiatric report: "Low frustration tolerance. Lack of ability to work in a team. Impulse control disorder. Narcissistic rage." Here's the peak of your career : "Aiding and abetting the emasculation of a child molester . Punitive transfer from the PI Munich to Niederkaltenkirchen." There, too: charges of coercion and warnings because of uncontrolled use of firearms. Now stop it, I didn't kill Barschl. How about, if you're looking for the real killer? You had a blood-alcohol of 2.1 mg. You were drunk on the night of the crime, You could have wiped out half of Niederkaltenkirchen without realizing it. In your place I would confess everything, preferably as remorsefully as possible. Godammit, I didn't do it! When I last saw Barschl, he was still alive. Excuse me, Mrs... uh... Dings. Some news. Your father assures me that you came home at a quarter to three on the night of the crime. I'll get you anyway, Eberhofer. Even if I have to turn over every stone. And you for false testimony! Why don't you sleep at night? I refuse to stay in bed. Don't think you're going to get away from me. You remain suspended. If it helps us find the truth. - You are so screwed. Yeah, you too. - Goodbye. Police state. Did you really have to do that? That you should kill Barschl right away? Did it really have to be like this? But it wasn't me. What you're getting me into again! Do you understand? False statement! False affidavit! I'm not going to tell anyone anything. Because it wasn't me. You got that? You're just lucky, that blood is thicker than water. But I'd like to know one thing: Where did you get this blatant temper, ha? Yes, where did you get that? I'm not done yet! I'll tell you one thing: From now on you smoke with me, so that you'll be a bit! calmer. So, now we concentrate on it again, who killed Barschl. And we'll convict him. Then it doesn't matter.., whether Franz's alibi is true or not. My suggestion: Let's check out the widow Barschl. In the case of murder, always check the spouse first. What kind of person is that, Mrs. Barschl? Ivana, that's her name. She's probably Russian. And from the type and age she doesn't fit to Barschl. Interesting. When I say "Russian," you say? Vodka. - Others? Prisoner of war. Mafia. Russian equals mafia . Franz, your sense of criminology has been atrophying ever since you became the village sheriff in Hinterarsching. You don't make yourself suspicious and are good, and Rudi takes care of everything. (Slurp) Tell me, Paul. How do you know the grandma actually? Well, Lene. That's a very long story, Franz. And it's also a very old story. I've been on the road a lot and I'm a little tired now. Where do you live anyway? - He lives there with us. You'll lose everything right away. But it's nice.., that you are back, Franzl. You know what else would be nice? A proper lunch. Didn't they give you anything to eat... in prison? Yes, but nothing decent. Uh, Mrs. Eberhofer. I wouldn't have eaten either. I haven't eaten yet either. But nobody cares. Mei, I have no time. I have to take care of Paul. Just because he can't rattle his teeth anymore, we have to eat the same. - And the soup meat? Paul can't bite it anymore anyway. No one was able to bite it, it was so tough. The dog got it. (Grandma) Look here. You're going to buy some warm liver sandwiches at Simmerl's, aren't you? Do you like it, Paul? Then it's right. So, should I bring you something or are you on a drug diet? Get away with that sausage. (Rudi) drug diet. (Grandma laughs.) A Polo? That's not a car, moron! Do you think I can't buy my son a decent car? Dad. I just want a Polo or something. Please accept that. A Polo is a chick car! So, are you a chick? No. You're getting a BMW 7 Series. That's it, that's it, Amen. I won't let them say anything against me. Hello. Oh. Franz. Hi. What's going on? No! Well, well, nothing. Did they let you out again? You old colleague assassin. Hammer, Franz, really. - What? Well, your supervisor comes to you stupidly and you just: Ching! Ching! Ching! Really great! I'll get four warm liver sandwiches, please. - Of course. Four meat loafs in a fresh roll. Coming right up. I was thinking anyway, that it wasn't you. That would be too stupid, with your own knife. Although, after eight halves. Simmerl. Sorry. Four warm ones to go. On the way. Ching. Can you imagine, that I was worried about you? You know, I was really in shock. But now I'm back. It really didn't go any faster. Did you kill Barschl? You have to tell me the truth. No, I didn't kill Barschl. Really? Honestly. I would know. Mei. You know, how you can be sometimes. I don't know if I would have endured that, if you were a murderer. Susi... Come on, Susi, not there. Are you embarrassed about me? Embarrassed would be too much. The whole community has known for 100 years.., that we are together. Yes, yes, Eberhofer, soon we will have to do without you, from what I hear. That's what happens when the gun is loose. And then a colleague! Lord on the cross! How dare you, Mr. Mayor? Franz didn't do anything! - That's all right, Miss Susi. Just don't get excited. Oh, before I forget. The handicapped bus driver can't make it this week. He has a bowel obstruction. Yes and? Yes nothing and. Ms. Maierhofer from the LKA said.., as long as he doesn't do any police work, Mr. Eberhofer is allowed to be assigned for community purposes. So, 2 p.m. , Monsignor Meier Workshops. Avanti, avanti. I'm not driving a handicapped bus. - The bus is not handicapped. (playful brass band music) Do you always drive now? Uh, yeah, let's see. Rather not. (whispering) (loud pop music) Disco bus! (muffled pop music and bawling) And now give him eternal rest through our Lord Jesus Christ. (all) Amen. May I bury him? - Please. (quiet music) That'll knock your socks off, Eberhofer. You scared me! Remember: Silence is my business. - Hm. So, this Ivana Barschl, maiden name Ivana Schuk, actually comes from Russia. Until her marriage she worked illegally as a prostitute. Awesome, Rudi! Until seven years ago a police officer, who was still in vice at the time, busted the brothel. Now guess what his name was? Barschl. - Bingo. And a month later her name was also Barschl. Does she still have contacts in the milieu? Does the bear shit in the forest? I'm going to check out our merry widow. I'd rather do it myself. You see, what you can find out about Barschl. And now a silent exit, I can't afford... I can't afford any trouble. Your words. Yes. Uh, love, go? Yes. Well, Eberhofer? Do you want to accompany your victim on his very last journey? Yes, uh... And hands off the widow Barschl. That goes for your friend too. You're under observation by the LKA. If the LKA finds out.., that you are investigating yourself, then you have an even bigger problem. Chief, I'm here on a purely personal matter. Yes. Because Barschl was such an old friend of yours. You really loved him. That's exactly how you can put it. And don't forget: I can do nothing for you. Internal investigations, that's in the hands of the LKA. I'm on the outside. (somber music) My condolences, Mrs. Barschl. That you dare to come here. I don't want to disturb you long. I just have one question. Did your husband at the PI Landshut actually have any enemies? Yes, he did. Namely you. Yes, but in my case I know first hand: I didn't do it. Your colleagues are are not quite sure about that. Why are you still still suspended from duty? Yeah, but that's why you and I talk, right? So: Where were you at the time of the crime? I was tired. I took a taxi home in the parking lot, I took a cab home. Am I suspicious now, or what? As a wife you are practically always a suspect. Eberhofer, leave the wife alone right now, will you? Have you no respect for a widow? - Your colleague Fux. Hey, tell me, Fuxi. What was that actually with you and Barschl? Weren't you also one of one of his special friends? - Yes. And? What do you mean? Where were you, when Barschl was killed? What do you mean by that? - Well, what I'm saying. Listen carefully, Eberhofer. Do you know what your problem is? You've got a really big mouth. And in your place I would pay attention, that you do not even really one hits you in the face. Can you please let go of me now? I have, unlike you. a real alibi. We were at Sailer Michi in the sauna the whole evening. Gentian infusion. We are bored. We want to go home. Did you call for backup? Say once, we agreed on coffee. We're not allowed to have coffee. - Yes, but surely not beer either. Come on! Did you at least bring me a half? - Oh no, I forgot. (suspenseful music) Do you still have all cups in the cupboard? Mrs. Barschl has just lost her husband. By a crime, in which you are the prime suspect! Our only suspect, with a a strong motive, a murder weapon and... An alibi. Oh! Your alibi is so thin. Now watch this. Barschl used to work as a hooker... - As a prostitute. But yes. But Ms. Barschl has an alibi. And a watertight one at that. She was sitting at the time of the crime in a cab to Landshut. Um... And the other colleagues, who were at the wedding? His colleagues went together to their colleague Sailer's in his basement sauna. Yes, I know. Gentian infusion. Super alibi. Mr. Eberhofer, if you harbor suspicions against your colleagues, you are welcome to pour your heart out to me. In private. - I don't swear at colleagues . Then you'd better stop.., tampering with the investigation, or I'll talk to the magistrate. And why are you still running around in uniform? Uh, my other clothes are in the laundry. (pop music) That's funny, that's nice. Drive another round in our death gyro. Want to do it again? - Yessss! (loud music and bawling) (distant barking) (groaning) Kiss my ass! Zefix, do you believe it! (Groan) I tell you, the quack, I'll report him. This quack of a urologist, I'll report him! Why is he getting so upset? - Yes, why? Because of Amy-Gertrud. - Isn't she yours? Of course it's mine. Who else should it be from? But that's exactly the problem. For the child the problem is certainly times much bigger, that it is from you. Very funny. In any case I'll report him, this quack. Yes, and why now? My, he's the one who did the vasectomy. Vaseko what? Yes, snap, snap, away, off, closing time. Just neutered. Shh! But instead of a shift in the shaft and free ride for free citizens, I continued manned space flight. And Mary blames me. She didn't want a third child. Not for the sake of everything on this planet. Because two is already an imposition. (Flötzinger) Yes, look here! Hello, Franzl! How is it going? Serial killer! The knifeman of Niederkaltenkirchen, have the honor! First: At the next murderer's spell I will actually become one. Second: Beer. And third: Beer. Cheers. Do you know what the name of the colleague is, who's investigating me? Thin Lizzy. - Ned, right? Like the rock band from the seventies? Yeah, if I tell you. Oh, go on. Do you remember? - Yes, I remember. # Whack for my daddy-o # # ♪ Whack for my daddy-o, there's whiskey in the jar-o. (Music: "Whiskey in the Jar" by Thin Lizzy) # As I was goin' over # the Cork and Kerry mountains # I saw captain Farrell # and his money he was countin' . # ♪ I first produced my pistol ♪ # ♪ then produced my rapier ♪ # ♪ I said stand o "er and deliver # ¶ or the devil he may take ya. # ♪ Musha ring dum a do dum a da ♪ (muffled) # Whack for my daddy-o! # Whack for my daddy-o! # There's whiskey in the jar-o... # (Tire squeal, song continues) (loud bawling and jeering) (unintelligible screams) (jeering) # Musha ring dum a do dum a da! # ... Musha ring dum a do dum a da! # Musha ring dum a do dum a da! # Musha ring dum a do dum a da! # ♪ Oh yeah! (groaning and moaning) Yay! - Did you hurt? Yes, go lick! Once more, Franz! Once more! Flötzinger, where's your baby? The Amy-Gertrud! (babbling) Shit! (soundless laughter) (quiet music and cockcrow) Morning. Morning. (soft moaning) Isn't there any breakfast? You have to ask your grandmother. - Where is grandma? In bed. In bed? At this time? Did something happen? You can't know everything. Yes, dammit, then just take a look! The guest room is empty. Yes, maybe Paul has left. Because he couldn't stand you anymore. - Rubbish! His shoes are still outside her room. What, Paul is upstairs? In grandma's room? Yes, where else should he be? Grandma, grandma! Yes, so jealous of me! Why do you two look so stupid? (Paul) Morning. And? Slept well? Do you like breakfast, Paul? No, thank you, dear Lene, for the trouble. But in the morning I always have no appetite. Then we can make our little trip right now, can't we? I'll show you everything what has changed with us. Do you like? Wonderful. Let's go! Yes, all right. Godspeed, boys. See you later! And stay good, right. (Grandma and Paul laugh.) (He mimics the laughter.) I think I'm crazy! Who does she think she is? She's not 17 anymore. That's embarrassing! (quiet music) (unintelligible) Eberhofer! Does the word responsibility mean anything to you? I entrusted you with our handicapped fellow citizens. And what do you do? Deliver them home way too late and drunk. Can you still be saved? - Hi, Susi. Probably something thrown in again. Sucked a crystal meth or some other diridari! If the press finds out, I'll be so big in the papers! Do you give a damn, what I found out? After all, it's about YOUR head. Do you want one? I have the e-mail account from Barschl. You can do that? Yes, so the brother-in-law. Anyway. Your friend Barschl has regularly ordered ladies' underwear on the Internet. Namely size XXL, cup size double D. It was certainly not for his Ivana. Did Barschl have a girlfriend? - Yes. And from the looks of it, quite a handsome one. (Phone rings.) (groaning) Susi? I have here a Ivana Barschl on the phone. Yes and? She wants to know whether a Franz Eberhofer works here. What should I do? Put her through. Don't ask such stupid questions! You stupid ass! Mr. Eberhofer is available now, I'll put you through. Hello? Mr. Eberhofer? I wanted to call you because our last meeting was a bit unfortunate. To what do I owe the honor that you would call the man who killed your husband? Susi, see you later. Oh! Hey! Do you have a bird, or what? Why do you let that chick invite you to dinner? Tonight, on our night? I've pre-cooked. Meatballs with potato salad and a fruit salad. Are you listening to my phone calls? Why are you going to her for dinner. Because I'm still a suspect. And because I have to prove my innocence, because no one else will. At a dinner, of all things! In a pinch, yes. If it serves the cause, then also at a dinner. Susi, Barschl has already turned me down twice. And all of a sudden she invites me to dinner. She couldn't be more suspicious. Besides, that's the only lead I have. (teasing music) Hey, Eberhofer! Where are you going? Chief. Are you waiting for the service car? Are you investigating? No, why? - Why are you driving around in your company car? It has to go to the detailer. Nanowax, underbody. Do not investigate yourself. Hands off the widow! You're gambling with your career and your life! You want to marry Susi. Family, children, that costs everything! Chief, I have to. Appointments, appointments. Go fuck yourself! You stupid... Ivana, you're Russian, eh? But you speak accent-free German. Hats off. What one can not say about you. How's that? And how did you come to Germany? I wanted to get to know the country . When I came here, there was of course there was no job as an au-pair. I fell for cheap tricks and ended up in a brothel in Landshut. I want to live here in peace. That's why I don't want my past get around. What are you looking at, Mr. Eberhofer? I was just wondering, what cup size you have. Double D probably not, right? What makes you think that? Apparently your great love had a mistress. Quasi another great love. A very great one, in fact, if you look at it purely in terms of size. What are you getting at? Your husband has ordered on the Internet sexy lingerie on the Internet. Sexy lingerie plus size. Do you have any idea, who the mistress was? Come. Ah, I didn't know, that you had a child. We don't have one. But my husband has always wanted a little girl. - I see. (playful music) They weren't for his mistress. My husband wore the clothes himself. - What? That was his fetish. Barschl was gay? Quite the opposite. Women's clothes excited him. Really? Aha. But for you that was certainly totally unpleasant, right? What? That my husband liked to wear women's clothes at home, or that he forced me to have sex with him? Then you can be glad that you're rid of your husband, right? I've been forced to do a lot of other things in my life, but if you want to get specific, yeah, I'm kind of relieved that my husband is dead. Is that so? I was grateful to him at first, that he married me. But why does a man marry a prostitute? Now I've finally convinced you of my guilt, haven't I? If you ask me so directly. (doorbell) (with accent) Hello, Ivana. Spasiba. Hm. Greetings. May I introduce Mr. Eberhofer from the police. Victor Grablonski, an acquaintance from the old days. Mr. Eberhofer investigates the murder of my husband. Uh... aha. And, do they already know who did it? Oh, it's an ongoing investigation. I'm not allowed to say anything. - Hm. Yes, then... - Do you want a glass of champagne, Victor? Spasiba. What did you want now, Victor? It sounded so urgent sounded so urgent. No, not that urgent. We can talk about anything. I have any secrets from Mr. Eberhofer. We'll talk tomorrow. I'll call you, okay? Please come, tell me what's going on. (Russian) (vana responds in Russian.) Goodbye, Commissioner. - Goodbye. (Russian) (Russian) What's his name? - Grablonski, Victor. He seems the type. (Rudi) ...lonski. Good, Mr. Grablonski will be investigated up to his underpants. All right. See you, later. Bye. (quiet music) Hmm. So good. Almost as good as grandma's. You, question: What would you say, if I wore ladies' underwear? As long as you don't put on my clothes and wear them out, I don't care. Mhm. Susi. You have a super ass. You think so? I was thinking, whether I'll get some suction. I think half would be enough. - Just don't do that. Imagine how that would look, if you only had one butt cheek. You, go! You like sweeping? You like trouble? (distant cockcrow) (Franz) Good morning. (Grandma) Good morning. Where is Paul? The gentleman is not doing so well. Probably from too much courting at his age. Probably too much bad Company there at court. - Yes, of course. You don't have to look around for long. In future you can put your kernel on the corner of the table. - What? You can bang your chin on the edge of the table... if you want to eat something. Cause grandma's got a houseboy now. She doesn't have time for us anymore. Sapperlot! Stop picking on Paul. A man's man, who eats porridge for breakfast. Is no longer a toddler. Then make your coffee yourself. You're big enough. I can't do that! - Because you've never tried it. Because you've never explained it to me. Because there is nothing to explain about a coffee machine. Yeah, kiss my ass. Is this going on all the time? (low growl) (conciliatory) Dad. Now just admit, that you are jealous. Otherwise you would not have to get so upset. What a nonsense! Look, Boy, it's practically like this: Grandma and I... We are actually like a married couple. And somehow it also fits. And besides, after all, the two of us raised you two boys. And that's not so bad, as I mean. But not so amazingly good, when I look at Leopold. Dork. And now let grandma have her fun, right? (horns) (Franz) Rudi. Hi, Rudi. Only semolina dumplings? Did grandma only make semolina dumpling soup? - Yes. And is there anything left over from yesterday? What was there to eat? Semolina dumpling soup. Why does grandma only cook such shitty semolina dumpling soups? Because of her Paul. He can't stand anything else. Well. In her old age, Mrs. Eberhofer still has an affair. A semolina dumpling affair. (giggling) What do I want? Oh. So, this Victor Grablonski is the former pimp of Ivana Barschl. And Barschl arrested him himself as he picked up the Chanel, where Ivana bought it. Since he's been out again, he works as a security consultant, but still in the adult industry. From what you hear, business is not so good. What I'm just wondering is: Why does this Grablonski show up just when I'm invited to dinner at Barschl's? And why does Mrs. Barschl tell you, just like that, that she is happy that her husband is dead? And why do they have a fully furnished nursery? But no child. Franz, I suggest: Observation. Namely... large cutlery. Hm. (whistling melody and bird chirping) I find that totally unprofessional, that you take Ludwig with you. That is a serious personal stakeout and not a family outing. - Why? Ludwig is an A1 serious watchdog, right, Ludwig? Yes. (ponderous brass band music) Gymnast greeting with seven letters, Rudi? (soft snoring) Gout in the big toe, also... seven letters. (Rudi lustfully) Oh yes. But Lady Bellinda, I was quite good. Oh. Yes! (soft moaning) Target. (clearing throat) 2:37 p.m, Target leaves the house. So. You, Rudi, question: Who is Lady Bellinda? (The engine starts.) (lively music) It doesn't get any more conspicuous than that, does it? - Yeah, should I overtake them? (Franz) Is this your first time? She took out 20 thousand. I saw it very clearly. Quick! Is that Grablonski? - Yes, it is. She has an alibi. He's got the contract. That is the payoff. Bingo. Mhm. (Franz) That's you. This is Mr. Grablonski. And that's 20,000 euros in cash. Look, your husband was killed. You have a perfect alibi. But barely a week later you hand over 20,000 euros to your ex-pimp. Is there a connection? Yes, there is. Yes, then out with it. You'll see, you'll feel better. Victor said, I still owe him one. I was his hooker, he'd invested in me, I have to pay him reasonable compensation . I don't believe a word you say. Grablonski killed your man for the 20,000. Mr. Eberhofer, You have a vivid imagination. The Barschl woman gave Grablonski 20,000 for the murder of her husband. That's a really good theory, gentlemen. Yes, you could have thought of that yourself, right? But Madame was so sure, that I killed Barschl. As I was still at the CID, we investigated in all directions and not into the first suspect, just because we stumbled across it . Are you done? Ah, you're welcome to apologize to me. Gentlemen. Your theory has only one tiny little hook. Grablonski was sitting in a Munich drunk tank at the time of the crime because he had gotten into a fight with the bouncer of an in-disco. Do you think the LKA is just floating along in the soup? Grablonski was the first one we checked out. Where did you learn to investigate? Can it be, that Mr. Rudolf Birkenberger, the Detective of the Year, the Godfather of Backdoor Sleuthing, Grablonski's alibi has not been checked? Of course I checked it. What do you think? I'm doing the job. Yeah, not since yesterday. I even invested in a bouquet of flowers for the informant. There! $6.95 Euro for a bouquet from the gas station. And you're surprised that she doesn't spill the beans? Right now I'm working day and night. Only for you. Free of charge! And completely free, as we know, because you were too stingy again and wanted to save 20 Euro. Do you notice that one of us is always giving and the other is always taking? No. Really? Who? Whoa. Oh come on, Rudi, you're such a diva sometimes! (Hard rock ringtone) Eberhofer? (loud rock music from the car radio) (quiet banjo music) (cooing) (loud rock music) (muffled rock music) (Tire squeal, music and engine turn off) (subdued brass band music) (soft splash) She really wanted me to call you. - Thank you. Mrs. Hausladen? Thou shalt not kill. The fifth commandment. I have incurred a heavy debt. But you were in Lourdes, when your dad had an accident. You brought the Lourdes water with you. Do you remember? I prayed to the Mother of God, and Father died. You are not to blame for your dad's death. That was an accident. Your behavior and actions have brought this upon you. Your evil deeds are to blame and they stand so bitter that it hits you to the heart. (soft moaning) Um... Mrs. Hausladen? Uh... Mrs. Hausladen? Mrs. Hausladen, can you hear me? Tell me, did you take all of them? Thou shalt not kill. For or against what are they? These are the sleeping pills I prescribed for her, and these are the antidepressants. Mrs. Hausladen! That's dangerous, if you take them all at once. You can kill yourself with it. Hello, Eberhofer Franz. We have sleeping pill poisoning. Send an emergency doctor to the Hausladenhof in Oed. Every fucking day semolina dumpling soup, understand? Because the fine Mr. Paul can't stand anything else. I don't trust this Paul at all. I've never heard anything from a Paul. Never! Where is grandma anyway? At the cinema. Grandma? Yes. Madame is at the movies. - In broad daylight? And not alone. What do people say about that? And at her age. So much for discipline and order. Sodom and Gomorrah, I say, right? Father, does it have to be like this. I don't like to see that now. Yes, my God... What do you think, how the whole thing takes me away. Did Annemarie actually suffer from depression before the death of her father? Well, it didn't go so well for her. She just reproached herself. Reproaches. Why? Brunnermeier, I need to know this. What does this have to do with the death of your father? Well, Annemarie was expecting a child. Pregnant? And the child? She had it removed. - Abortion? She couldn't forgive herself for that. Did Paul get his medicine at 2:30? No... I fell asleep. What a brute, would you believe it. You can't even be away for a short time without everything immediately going down the drain. Paul? Paul, wake up, your medicine! How can you forget something like that! (Simmerl) Is that a BMW? And it doesn't look 14 years old. For your boy? Of course. I don't let anyone say anything against me. Do you know who I met? The Hausladen Annemarie. Do you know her? Well. - Hausladen Annemarie? That's the one from the farm, where the turkeys are? Mhm. Where the father fell down the stairs? Or? That must be a very Catholic one, what you hear. Is it true that the old Hausladen was completely gnawed on by the rats, how they found him? - Rubbish. Allegedly had an abortion. (loud snort) Hausladen? Ah go! She would have had to get pregnant first. She has never had a boyfriend. Not even at school. She was always been a walking prayer book. Or would you with her? - I have Gisela. But now just hypothetically. You wouldn't have Gisela. Or let's say Gisela would have a nasty skin rash. Would you then go with Hausladen? - Flötzinger, it doesn't matter. Wait a minute. Or let's assume, you were a castaway. Stranded on a desert island. No woman far and wide. Only the Hausladen. Would you go with her then? Now hold your tongue! - Would you then with her? And you would have no hands. None at all? Yes, none at all. See? Pregnant... (muffled reggae music) (loud music) # ...early in the morning. Do you know what time it is? Tell me, are you crazy? I live there. And I listen to my music when, as often and as loud as I like. I am not hard of hearing like your mother. I want to sleep now. When the music is quieter. Then you put something in your ears. What kind of nursery school did you have? You didn't get that from Leni! The music stays lower, otherwise something will happen. You brat, you miserable! Do you know what time it is? Tell me, Mom, are you still there? That's my stereo. Give me back the cable right now! You can have it back tomorrow. At the earliest. Mom, you give me back my cable right now, because otherwise... - What else? If you don't give me the cable, then... then I'll go now. You're old enough. You can do what you want. You'll see what you get out of it. Going on vacation? No, son, I've left home. I won't be treated like such a brat. Where are you going? I have friends. Besides, I don't see what business it is of yours. Well, give my regards to Moratschek. Bye now. (horns) In all of Niederkaltenkirchen we have ONE single telephone booth. And who hits it anyway? With his brand new BMW? My son, that dumbass, the dumbass. (Outcry) Oh shit. Greetings, Franz. And what are you missing? Well, on the left... He's missing a whole lot. First of all, he lacks a brain! And now, he's also missing a car. Maybe it's genetic. You crashed into a phone booth once too. I was drunk as a skunk then, too. - I wanted a Polo right from the start. If I hear that word again, then I'll forget myself. Or a Corsa. What did I do wrong with this boy, ha? A Twingo would have been okay too. Buy him a Leopard II. It looks good and is safe. Haha. (Franz) Good day. (Man) Good day. Where is Mrs. Hausladen? Ward 3, Room 8. That's the psychiatric ward, isn't it? (suspenseful music and announcement) Mrs. Hausladen, what did you actually want to tell me on the day you took the tablets? You were pregnant by your father, right? Mrs. Hausladen, your cab is here now. Thank you. [ Siren Wailing ] The cab is waiting. When exactly did you return by bus from Lourdes? Would you please go then too. Mrs. Hausladen has forgotten something. (Clearing throat) Even if someone had pushed Hausladen down the stairs, where is the connection to Barschl? I don't know yet, but it is certain: Both have a motive for murder and an alibi for the time of the crime. (shredder stalls.) So, I found a few more files. Make sure you get them done. And don't put your fingers into the shredder. So, Eberhofer, let's go! Hophophop! Will we see you tonight? I think we have work to do, Franz. What would you like for dinner? - I wanted to invite you to dinner tonight. What are you in the mood for? Cordon bleu with fried potatoes and buttered vegetables. - Mmm, buttered vegetables. Then until tonight. (both) Mmmmmm! Do you actually notice that Susi treats you like a bow-wow? Yes, where is he, Franzi? Look for the treat. Yes, and you tap over to her and her treat. You, Rudi, my need for jealousy is currently more than met with my dad. Why should I be jealous of Susi? That's ridiculous. I don't even really know Susi. Know. Yes, what if the two knew each other? Barschl and Hausladen? And one would have committed the murder for the other? Big catch: How would they know each other? They have nothing to do with each other. After all, Ivana Barschl was in the hospital. I think, you're getting lost in something again. There, that could be a connection. I'm sure I've seen a necklace just like that on Ivana Barschl. And I found it on the nightstand at Hausladen's. Yes, that is now really interesting. (imitating Rudi) Right? He is not rusty, the village sheriff. But how do they know each other? What do they have in common? What do women do? Yoga? What's it called? Pilate. Or something churchy? After all, there is Mother of God on the medallion. The Mother of God. No children. No children? Yes, no children. One of them had an abortion, the other a nursery for a girl. What Barschl perhaps always wanted. But the dear wife perhaps not? - Hm. Now we take Hausladen in the pincers, and properly. Now wait a minute, Rudi, we don't have anything! A shitty Lourdes connection is still no proof. (Hard rock ringtone) Grandma, how many times? You should not call me, when I'm on duty. Yes, well, I'm coming. Rudi, I have an emergency at home. Mr. Eberhofer, what is it, huh? Ashtray? - Ashtray! But this is a non-smoking household. Glasses always on the coasters. (doorbell) Hi Chief. Do you have any idea, WHERE my father might be? Your father? No. He's not, by any chance. on the couch with you? With me on the couch? C'mon now Eberhofer! Moratschek, I can take the piss myself. Goddammit! That's no way to treat your father! The poor man! Hello. - Ah! Mr. Eberhofer Junior. How nice, that you drop by once in a while. Good day, Mrs. Moratschek. I wanted to pick up my father. Oh, now we've just made ourselves really comfortable. - Exactly. Ten horses couldn't drag me out of here. - Would you like a non-alcoholic beer? Bärli? Why didn't you give junior slippers? He was too fast. Well, thank you very much. I'm in a hurry. Well, let's go. Yeah, but... only under protest. Hm. (quiet music) Ah go, Dad, now just come along. Did you like it so much with the Moratscheks? What exactly did grandma say about why I should come back home? Because Paul is not well at all. And she just wants you to come home again. Mhm. Do you know what's wrong with Paul? Cancer, I'd say. Probably in the final stage. Shit. . To be honest, I don't think he'll last long. He is already quite frail. But why doesn't he go home? When I die, I'll go home... or to a hospital. Not where, 100 years ago... I once had an affair. Watch your mouth! You're still talking about my mom. She had only just married my father at the time. It is not possible that he is Mom's lover. Do you understand? Yes. (overly clear) You need to go to a hospital, urgently. Grandma, look who I brought with me. My God, my God, you stupid Boy, you! (weakly) No, I'm not going. But you are seriously ill. That's why: HOSPITAL! CERTAINLY NOT! You have renal carcinoma. This is a cancer . And with a cancer, you go to a hospital. Paul said, he doesn't go to a hospital anymore. And that's why he doesn't go to any hospital. That's it. How one can be so stubborn? I wanted to tell you tell you earlier, but I didn't know then.., that it would end so quickly. After the war, Paul came to Niederkaltenkirchen as a refugee. And he was my first great love. We were 17. At some point I was pregnant. Paul got scared of the responsibility and ran away. But the old Eberhofer, he's always been in love with me, he married me pregnant. And then Paul came back. He wanted to stand by his child and marry me. But then it was too late. He was watching us and saw that we were doing well, the boy and me. He said, I'm happy with Eberhofer. He didn't want to disturb things. So he left again. And only now came back. (quiet xylophone music and quiet bird chirping) It's OK. (Rudi) Franz! Franz! I was just in Landshut. The Hausladen girl was actually there six months ago at an abortion clinic. And who was her bedmate? - Ilvana Barschl? Bingo! The two ladies know each other. - Awesome, Rudi. Now we have the two. Ludwig, come on, let's go home. Hey, what's up with your dad? He looked so sad. Ah, my. He just found out, that daddy isn't daddy. (Rudi) So. So, like before: You good cop, I bad cop. You stupid cop. - Hach. Mrs. Hausladen? Mrs. Hausladen, we know you're there. It's better if you open the door. (Clatter and fast polka music) Is that her? - Yes, who else? Mrs. Hausladen! Well, now she has to run into the clumps. Mrs. Hausladen! Mrs. Hausladen! Mrs. Hausladen, now just stand still! Now wait! Mrs. Hausladen! (Rudi) Yes, it was worth it. So, now we stand up! Mrs. Hausladen, half a year ago you were in the same abortion clinic as Mrs. Barschl. And there you made friends and poured your hearts out to each other. You have enumerated, what your father did to you, and Barschl, what her husband did to her. And after the Stopfer's wedding Barschl was dead. And the Barschl woman was in the cab at the time of the crime. Just as you were in Lourdes, when your father fell down the stairs. That's a bit too many coincidences, don't you think? Or maybe someone helped you and pushed your father? There, look. The medallion with the Mother of God you brought from Lourdes. One for yourself and one for Ilvana Barschl. He was a pig. A dirty pig. I wanted to keep the little boy, but he forced me to let it go. So that it does not come out that it was him. He treated me like an animal, father did. And Ivana, her husband was a pig too. (brass band music) Thou shalt in thyself no pity arise: Life for life, Eye for eye, tooth for tooth. Yes, I'm afraid that will be enough for eternal damnation. Rudi. (shrill battle cry) Mrs. Hausladen! (groaning and moaning) Rudi, you alright? - Shoot her! Do something! (groaning) We can talk about it calmly. We would also put in a good word for you and Mrs. Hausladen. Mrs. Barschl, I know your husband was a... brutal, controlling asshole. So, do you know that? Get down now! After what you two have been through, you wouldn't serve long anyway. Probably a suspended sentence. I believed a policeman once, and my life became hell. He checked everything, every day. That I wouldn't talk to anyone, that I don't run away. I didn't want a child. Not from him. I hated him. And now I rely on myself. There we go right back out again. Rudi Birkenberger, as always well equipped. No net. Good, plan B. Windows? Negative. Walled up. Ventilation shaft? Negative. Sewer. Good, Plan C. Help! (muffled cry for help) Where is your fiancé? - I don't know. He probably still has to cuddle with his Rudi. Is it still the other way around? Oh my, the state of things. Where is actually Franzl? Oh, where should he be? Probably with his Susi. Tell me, where is Franz? What do I know? He didn't buy any any liver sandwiches today. Yes, Simmerl, every day liver sandwiches, you'll be horrified at some point. Careful, Flötzinger. My meatloaf is not to be used with the word "horror" in the same sentence. The glutton has a hole in him. Hm. Cheers. (soft cooing) All my assets will go into a foundation. The Rudolf Birkenberger Foundation. The purpose of the Rudolf Birkenberger Foundation is... How can you keep eating in a situation like this? Believe me, Rudi. I have had only hunger pains in the last few days. I certainly do not want to die hungry. Die? Looks like it. Franz? You were the only real friend, I ever had. Actually, the best. Yeah, that's all right, Rudi. It's OK? That's the only thing you can think of? (She clears her throat.) Am I interrupting? Well bravo, you two again. All is well. (groaning) A madness, what women are capable of, huh? Of the men we need not even talk. I would have thrown Hausladen down the stairs too. Without batting an eye. His own daughter, what a pig. And Barschl... Thank you, gentlemen. We were the ladies on the trail of the ladies, but thanks to you, they got away. Barschl even had time to clear out her account. Right now those two are probably sitting in the Dominican Republic with a cocktail. Super. Thanks, great police work. - You're welcome. Can I have my guns back now? Do you drive everyone who deals with you crazy? Everyone Who Has Anything To Do With You? Mrs. um... Dings, uh... I think if we two had met earlier, then we both could have could really become something. Professionally. Rudi. - Franz. Merci. Yes, everyone has his place in life. Please leave him with me a little longer. (soft music) (whispers) Hello! It's a drama. A terrible drama. Where have you been, Franz? Where were you, when dear grandpa died? Resuscitation and so forth! You have first aid training, if I'm not mistaken. I also have firearms training. Boys! Come here once. That's great-grandpa. Grandma? I have already thought about the funeral. You, look. German oak and white lilies. That's wonderful. Paul wanted to be buried in a cardboard box. In a cardboard box? Grandma, you can't be serious. There's a whole bunch of people coming! There must be a flawless coffin and musicians and flowers. I don't want to be accused of burying my beloved grandfather in a shoe box. We have a reputation to lose. If Paul wants to be buried in a box, then Paul will be buried in a box. Lordship, father, now you say something too. - Yes. Just leave it alone for once, Leopold. (Priest) We hereby commit the body to Jesus Christ. (dragging brass band music) It still smells a bit like him. I put it back in there so that it stays that way for a long time. (priest) You've done a good job. (boy) But that was only a shoe box. The good Lord does not care. And now you go to your Susi, Franzl, right? And don't waste your most precious years. They are over so incredibly so unbelievably fast, you know? (Susi) Kids, you shouldn't run around here like that! My... - Godspeed, Susi. Hi, Grandma. You, Susi? Clara-Jane, Ignatz-Finn, this is a cemetery! (annoyed) Yes, Franz? Is there something? Listen... Lately I've had had a bit of time to think. And because life can can be over so quickly... Clara-Jane, stay away from the open graves! You meant ... And by the way, Grandma thinks that too ... So, that's why I wanted to ask you... if we two... (screeching) Ignatz-Finn! - ... then perhaps ... ...should marry. (Susi) Holy crow! Clara-Jane! Mei! If I catch you, you! (Ignatz, come here, you pig cripple! I'm armed. (Susi) You come here right now! (kissing sounds) You, Susi? - Mhm? Do you want to sit there for a long time? You're getting pretty heavy. You go! Three weeks and I have to go away with Mary and the little shits. Three weeks. Mother, father, baby cure. So that something can still be saved in terms of the relationship. Says Mary. I have agreed with Mary that I will look after Ignatz-Finn and Clara-Jane. To the Flötzinger his Schratzen? - Na! They are really looking forward to it. Then we can totally do a lot. Super, Susi. Wolfi, another half. Logical. Are you sure? - Why? (softly) Go home, for a Schmusi with Susi. Wolfi? never mind, pay! Logical.
