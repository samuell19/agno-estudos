Hello everyone, it's me again The Doll Saviour YY. Who're you? I'm Ji-yuet. C'mon. Look the blue one is close. Look how serious she is. Look how serious she is. What's wrong with her pose? God I did it. I did it. I didn't notice. I was just looking at her posture. I was just looking at her posture. I really wanna dance now. Then she did it. She's great. Oh I did it. Oh I did it. A massive Crayon Shin-chan. Oh I did it. My fave Mewtwo. Oh my Monchhichi! Never mind. Say goodbye to him. Challenge failed. Failed. Such a loser. Bye. Look. This's Langham Place. Ho Ji-Yuet! What? C'mon! It's lovely. -Don't stand that far away. C'mon. Don't be afraid. There's nothing to be afraid of. I'm just a little afraid. It's Nathan Road. It's quite breezy. So lovely I wanna scream. Hey, I'm Ho Ji-Yuet. What if someone looks up? -Nobody sees us. Oh someone saw us. Just joking. How dare you say my name! (June 2019) (The Hong Kong Government) (attempts to force through the extradition bill.) (It triggers an uprising led by the Hong Kong youth.) (After countless violent crackdowns, the government still ignores its people.) (From mid-June onwards, many young people have jumped) (from buildings to their death to seek martyrdom.) Around 4pm, a 35-year-old man in a yellow raincoat, Marco Leung Ling-Kit, climbed up some scaffolding 20 meters above Pacific Place displaying an anti-extradiction bill slogan, but fell from a great height and died in hospital. Many people visited Pacific Place in Admiralty at night. A small shrine was set up and many brought flowers to mourn the deceased protester Leung Ling-kit (21st July 2019) So cold. Shut up. Is this your home? Sorry, Sir. Lam Chi-Nam, Louis Lui, Ho Ji-Yuet, Lai Ka-Yan. Get up and come with me. They harassed me! They did harass me! Where were you? Where were you when I was there? What're you doing? Where were you when I was treated like a piece of meat? Lemme talk to her. To hell with them, they shall pay. Let's go. Ho Ji-Yuet. Let's go. Can give you a ride too. Get in the car. I can head home myself. Go home and have a good rest. Bye. Do you know what happened last night? Yes. It's lucky you weren't beaten to death. I am YY. 18 years old. Just finished my university entrance exams. My dad works in mainland China. For him, it's to seek more 'opportunities'. Mum's remarried in the UK. For her, it's to seek a better life. They didn't know I was arrested on the night of 21st July 2019. A lot happened that night. Graffiti on the national emblem at the PRC's Liaison Office. Riot police fired 36 rounds of bullets. A mob in white indiscriminately attacked citizens in Yuen Long station. And everyone started chanting Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time. (YY - 18 / Peaceful protestor) (Ji-Yuet - 18 / Peaceful protestor) If you hadn't suggested we stay longer at the protests that day, we wouldn't have been caught. Sorry. I just wanted to stay to try and help. Help? How can you help? I wasn't willing to just leave. Hong Kong won't change because you were unwilling to leave. Then should we just Then should we just do nothing? My Dad will find me a lawyer for a plea bargain. Then send me abroad to study. Where to? Anywhere but Hong Kong. Happy birthday. Thanks. Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time (I wish I could see the day of victory, ) (but the despair won't go away.) (Sorry, please keep fighting on behalf of me. Hong Kong Add Oil!) I told you to buy a bigger suitcase. The suitcase is too small to fit everything in. Mum, there's a still a month before departure. You are going to the UK, not Cheung Chau. There's so much to prepare. Hey, I'm heading out now. Are you really coming? It's gonna be a bloodbath. I didn't come last time and you got busted. Shouldn't I come look after you this time? (Nam - 20 / Valiant protester) (Bell - 21 / Logistics) How can you do this? It's illegal Sorry. I am really sorry. Sorry. I'm not against you guys. Sorry. I don't want your apologies either. Take care of yourselves! Are you done yet? Now the comrades are retreating. What, that fast? Hey, what are you doing? Damn, the Dogs (cops)! Go! This way Mr. Burnism! Bro Fai thanks for saving us again. The protest buddies again. Thought you two'd lie low. Can't wait even for a week? One more arrest and you are done. Now we've escaped. Same as yesterday. Comrades are fighting hard. Everyone counts. Do you want me to stay in and do nothing? Hello? Hello, Nam. Do you remember me? Yes, YY. I'm calling to say thanks for the sweets you gave me Thank you, bye bye. Hey hey. Bro Fai. Zoe, I miss you. Same here. Don't flirt with my sis otherwise I won't give you a ride! Alright. Excuse me for a sec. We are heading East. Do you need a ride? No, thanks. I live in Kwai Fong. Why not? I've asked my family to pick me up. Let me know when you arrive safely. Thank you. Must be boring waiting alone. Thank you. I should thank you. Do you know her? She was caught by Dogs when helping a comrade who was shot. Must be her first time. I'm not going home tonight. Let's go to yours. Okay sure. Hello? Hello? Bro Fai! What? Is she the one we saw that night? I saw her photos on the “Save 'Em” telegram group. I saw them on the LIHKG forum too. But it isn't a popular search. You two were arrested with her. Do you know where she lives? I remember she said Kwai Fong. Kwai Fong. Gotcha. If we go find that girl, what about the comrades in Chater Garden? There's gonna be a bloodbath today. You saw her once. Why are you so sure she'll commit suicide? It's a life. If we do nothing to save her, how can we say we have solidarity? Those in Chater Garden are lives too. Everyone has their own opinion Anyways we go to Kwai Fong first If the situation changes, I'll drive you back even if there's a bloodbath. (Bao - 38 / Social worker) Hey, I've arrived in Kwai Chung Plaza. Where did you park your car? Who are you? Sorry, I'm Bao the social worker from the Telegram group. Relax. Back to the girl. My chat history says she's been missing for 4 hours. A suicidal person normally takes action within 5 minutes to 1 hour. The next critical stage will be in 8 hours. Our social worker group hasn't received any news about suicide attempts in the area. The critical time will be after dark. Now it's 3. We have 4 hours to search. Hello, are you all here? Go search! What should we do now? Let's split up. The driver can circle around here. Others come with me and search in the Plaza. Got it? OK Let's go. Hello Right, the soup is still warm. It's in a thermos so you don't need to heat it up again. Lunch and dinner are in the fridge. Have to work now. Talk soon, dad. Remember your medication. Ok, bye bye. Excuse me. Have you seen this girl? I'll ask over there. Nope. Are you going to the rally? Yes. She's planning to commit suicide. Let's swap Telegram details. I'll keep an eye on it. OK. Hello -Can I help? Sorry have you seen this girl? You recognise her right? Do you know her full name? Her full name is Lai Ka-Yan. Lai Ka-Yan. Are you two friends? We both study at Lee Shau Kee College. Do you know where she lives? We are not that close. Do you know how I can find her address? Hey still talking? Sorry, one sec. I'm a social worker. We're looking for her. If you see her, then gimme a call. Call me. Sorry. Lime Juice please. You two go to the college. We'll go to some claw machine arcades. Stay in touch. OK. Lemme go and ask. Excuse me. Excuse me, anyone here? Excuse me. (Louis - 18 / Valiant protestor) (Mr. Burnism - 15 / Scout) I'm telling ya. Don't hang out with your goddamn friends anymore. I won't give you a cent if you do. You won't even be able to eat shit. Got it? What's wrong with being Chinese? As I said many times, it's not about being Chinese, it's this govt When were you born? Do you know how to make money? What's wrong with the CCP? Let me tell ya. Money makes the world go round. The richest rules. Our government is the same. There're 1.4 billion in China. You guys don't really matter. If you can make money, who cares whether or not I am your dad. Working in a restaurant is a trade too. And those goddamn friends of yours are rioters. You little brat, where are you off to? Going to study. Study? Don't cause any trouble. Don't come back if you leave. You guys have a lot of guts. Be valiant, once and for all. Have you heard about 'frontliners for husbands'? Again? Want me to kick you out? Nah I'd be charged for rioting without you. You asked for it! You all know each other? I drove them on the 12th June. Drove them a few more times after that. Happy coincidence. How old are you, child? Aren't you too young to be on the frontline? I'm 15, not a child anymore. 2pm-Police Headquarters-Two Patrol Cars- Towards Chater Garden. Mum? Where are you? I'm in Causeway Bay. Causeway Bay? Are you marching now? No, I'm going to Dan's to play video games. He lives there. Then call me back when you get to Dan's. OK. Sorry dear. Could you read it for me? I have presbyopia so I can't read small characters. Can you see how much postage costs to the UK? It's 4.90 to the UK. Hmmm, it's not 3.70? They raised the price ages ago. Did they? Hello have you seen this girl? Have you seen this girl? No. Hello have you seen this girl? Mister have you seen this girl? Excuse me have you seen this girl? She's pretty. Your daughter? No no no. Nope. Thank you. Young man, can you teach me how to catch them? Teach you? Lemme help you then. That's great! Hey. Hey, let's rest a bit. Ms. Bell Chan, you'd better stay here and rest. I'll go up myself. Lam Chi-Nam, what do you mean by that? What? I just told you to rest? I asked you what you mean by it? Not tired anymore? Then let's go. Fine. I don't wanna quarrel with you now. Actually, what grade are you in? Grade 12. Don't I look like it? Still young. Do your parents know you go out to protest? They know but don't stop me. Received any injuries？ On 12th June, yes, but it's okay. That day, I was afraid too. Weren't you afraid when they shot? Of course. Same as everyone. But fear won't stop us. Not bad. Least you met some comrades. Right. What do your parents do? Dad is a cook and mum a housewife. My dad is totally red. Totally red? When I get home after finishing a battle outside, he criticises and scolds me. It makes me want to cry. What did he say? He said I'm ruining Hong Kong and got brainwashed. He gets angry when I talk about cops. He supports the police. He even thinks the police have the right to beat his own son to death. He even wanted to kick me out. Kick you out? Yes. Did he do it? He did. Closed the door? Yes, Glad that I could go to my mum's place. They're divorced. They split up. Don't be too impulsive on the frontline. Yes, but it's hard to be calm once you're there. I know, but no matter how much they provoke you Well.. If you confront them, you'll suffer. Of course but you've gotta do something to vent out your anger. Then it's just venting for venting's sake. We just want to achieve our goals. They vent out their anger, but it doesn't mean we have to do the same thing. We are fighting for our demands. And you know what you are fighting for. Right. (Bro Fai - 35 / Driver) (Sis Fai - 24 / Logistics) You okay? Too much AC? No, I've got hay fever. Sis, take the flower away. OK. It's rare to have real flowers in a car. This white tulip was Mum's favorite flower before she left us. We won't be too late this time, right? We'll make it this time! Morning, Brother. Morning. Ji-Yuet, could you reply me? Why are you being so unreasonable? I told you I'm not free today. Yes, to hell with your money. Me crazy? Go fuck yourself. There's not that many Hong Kong people like you who despise money and help protesters with their sis. But you two don't resemble each other at all. She isn't my sis. She's my gal. Just a joke. She is my sis. But there's about a ten-year-gap between us. I hope you don't mind me asking but why are you here with your sis helping with the search? My mum committed suicide. She jumped off a building. Sorry. Depression. If I'd been less busy at work and my sis less busy at school, we could've stayed at home more and this wouldn't have happened. I'll go back in. OK. Egg noodle. Thank you. Ordered one without spring onions for you. Eat up quickly and we can get back out. What a wonderful sis you are. What would I do without you? Gross. Get lost! I wanna have such a good brother too. Fuck off! How many siblings do you have? Only me. And the bastard pro-China old man. He keeps saying we disturb them from earning a living. What an old git. Do you think you're worse off than me? My parents are 'dogs'. Dogs? Dirty Cops! Do they know you're here? Of course not, I lied and told them I'm playing video games at a friend's. If it gets too late, I told them I'd stay over. I don't wanna go back to that 'dog-hole'. Are you afraid of bumping into your parents when protesting? Better to bump into them and let them kill me. 'Dirty cops, may your whole family die!' I'm fine. Triads! Cops-and-triads-collusion! Close the curtains. Otherwise the rioters can recognise us. Mum, can I switch on the light? Don't! Those are maniacs out there. They will keep flashing if they see us here. And dad can't get off work tonight. Understood. These young scum took money from the Americans to protest. They should all die. No one'd pity them. Right! Tell Emperor Xi to squash them with tanks. Money? Who took any fuckin' money? $3000 for a protest. Everyone said so. $3000 to get blinded and injured? 10 years in prison for rioting. It could happen to your sons and daughters. I'd arrest them all. Arrest who? Stand up and say it! Stand up and say it! Which one of you is Mr.Burnism? You are young and admirable. I'm Sailor-moon rider. What you laughing at? Sorry, I was choking. Comrades and citizens from 'Save 'Em' group are searching for YY in every MTR station. A comrade told us she lives in Kwai Shing West. I was riding my bike nearby, so I came to tell you guys about it. Leave the surrounding area to us. We leave Kwai Shing West to you guys. Let's work together. Don't overlap, okay? Gotcha. Thanks. Keep in touch. Well done. Not a soul. Let's go there and see What? I told you to keep searching no matter what What are you doing still waiting? Tell the social worker she's not there. Lam ChiNam I'll keep searching then. Lam Chi-Nam What now? Do you have any plan of where you're going? Better than randomly wondering around. I told you to rest. I'm asking if you know where you're going? There's a terrace over there. Perhaps there's a clearer view up there. Let's go up for a look. Lam Chi-Nam. Is there a girl up on that roof? Hey, it looks like someone up there is gonna jump Insane We aren't joking. The roof is locked. Only security can get up there. Don't bullshit okay? Can you go up to check? It's a matter of life and death. No is no. Let him go up please. You youngsters don't meddle around in others' business I'm just here to work. I have a family to feed. What the fuck? Piss off. I'm gonna call the cops. Call then. Call! That Chinese chick is doing her laundry on the roof again. Who patrolled last? Why isn't the roof locked? Tell her to come down. Sorry. Excuse me, could you gimme a candle please? Excuse me. Excuse me, have you seen this girl? What? Missing one cup of coffee? Damn! I delivered to ten different buildings today. I am not going out again! Ask someone else to deliver! Hi there, have you seen this girl? Lemme take a look. Please, I have to see her. She lives in Block 4 and often orders takeaway. Do you remember her unit number? How can I recall every unit in Block 4? Thank you. Miss, your drinks. Found her? No. Hey. Block 4. She lives there. That way. -Go. Split into three groups again. Nam and Bell towards the staircase. You two over there. And us three will head this way. No. Let's check this one. Sorry have you seen this girl? What are you doing here. Searching for somebody. Searching for somebody？ Don't make such a racket. How's it going? Not on this floor? No. Let's go downstairs. Hello. Stop peeking. May I ask- Get lost. OK. Nothing on our side. Let's meet on the platform in 10. Let's go. Have a quick word. What? How's that construction project from Bro Chiu going? I quit. Quit? I can't be distracted. I wanna focus on the protests. You can't protest without a penny! We promised to save up to move in together when I come back from the UK. Can we live up to this promise? No one knows how Hong Kong will turn out. You've a great chance to go on student exchange in the UK better just stay there for good. I said can we live up to this promise? Madam, you study at a respectable university, but I am a construction worker without a degree. Hong Kong's totally broken. There's nothing for you to stay behind for. Only the non-stakeholders with no money or future like me would stay and risk our lives here. Do you understand? Our worlds are poles apart! Hey, why are you out protesting? The rain is so heavy! And you? Because of Nam. You really treat him as a real bro. Yes, even closer than my real bro. Now you know. It's your turn. Back in 2014, my dad was one of the police who fired tear gas. My mum would scold my dad and ask how he could treat young people like that. I wasn't even 10 years old then. This year, my mum also changed. She even supports my dad beating up young people. Do we have to change when we grow up? If so, I don't wanna grow up. Actually, I only know you as Mr. Burnism. What's your real name? What? Doxing me now? You must have an English name. Baby Chun. Baby? Such a pussy! Why not Blimey? Fuck you. -Fuck you back. When will it stop? Excuse me, is there anyone? I got a Whatsapp message from YY's friend. She lives in Block 1, Unit 1632. Go! Have you found the key? I'm looking. No. Come down. There are two scenarios now. First, YY has left home. Second, she's at home, but intentionally won't open the door. Or, she has already.. Don't do that. Hey what're you doing? You don't wanna force the door open do you? What else can we do? Can't we stay calm and think of other options rather than forcing the door open? Right, think! There's no time left, what if she… Then you'd better just force it open. Instead of arguing, shouldn't we act quickly? You two keep an eye on the lift. Zoe and Bro Fai on the stairs. The two of us will stay here. Wait and see then. It's coming up now. It's coming up now. Tell him to hurry up. It's almost here now. It's almost here. She left. Be quiet and search around the house. It seems to be YY's room. Hey, there's a letter to her Dad. That's not for you. Don't open it. It might mention where she went. The letter is addressed to her family. This could be our only clue. We shouldn't look at her suicide note. If it were her suicide note, we shouldn't wait. Open it. What's it say? Dad, I'm sorry to write this letter to say goodbye. We haven't had a meal together for a long time. You're often in mainland China and argue over politics with me when you're back. I don't want us to have bad feelings. I wish we could get along despite our differences. Anyways, I'm not mad at you. I hope you aren't either. I've been thinking of the weekends during childhood. You took the whole family out and we flew kites and had barbeques. I miss my childhood so much. I don't know when you will get my letter, but I hope you will respect my choice. And I hope my determination to pursue freedom could change your views about the protests. I love you, Dad. What's after that? Bye forever, Ka-Yan. What are you doing? Please calm down. Listen to me. Listen to me, ok? Calm down first. It's too late. There's still time. There's definitely still time. We have no time, we're too late again. It's ok. It's ok. We'll definitively make it this time. They harassed me! They did harass me! Where were you? Where were you when I was there? Where were you when I was treated like a piece of meat? What're you doing? Lemme talk to her. To hell with them, they shall pay. Let's go. Use this. It's fully charged. Still just like a kid. Dominic the lawyer wants a word with you all. It's already been 30 hours. You must all be exhausted. But that doesn't mean you should relax. While you might not accept it I have the duty to make it clear. You are likely to be charged for illegal assembly. It's not set in stone though. But this govt's gone mad. They'll proceed with even the tiniest clue. So you all better lay low for a while. Now I'll tell you what you should prepare for and what you will probably face next. First of all, nobody should leave Hong Kong. Please repeat to your boyfriend what I just told you so that he can mentally prepare for the worst case scenario. You'd better watch out for your boyfriend. He's difficult to control. Thanks, Dominic. Well, it's my duty. I'm heading off. Call me if there's anything urgent. Is the game up? How long do we need to wait? One more minute. Comrades at Chater Garden need help. I said just wait for a minute. Louis. Your comrades are many whereas YY is alone. I don't think YY is unimportant. I just don't wanna do nothing. At least we wait for news from Sailor-moon rider. Why is YY more important to you than our comrades? Hey. YY just uploaded a selfie with a doll! Hey. Where's my drink? Sorry, what did you order? The one with less ice and sugar. Less ice and sugar. I'll get it for you immediately. Sorry boss, I wanna take half a day off now. What? Try to search every corner. Excuse me, have you seen this girl? She left about an hour ago. What now? She said YY left an hour ago. Well.. Let's circle around the main street. Circle around? People need support in Chater Garden! Let's talk outside. Hey, where're we going? Stop arguing. Tell us then. Can you stop talking for a second? Where are we going? Be patient. Hey, move quickly. Go across the road. Let's find her first. Why are we crossing the road? Enough! When should we stop searching? Come over here first. We aren't searching, we're just wandering aimlessly. Tell him to come back. Tell him to come back. Come with us. Why? You just wanna hook up with her. Say that again. -I said you wanna hook up with her. Say that again. -I said you wanna hook up with her. Stop fighting. Calm down. Police! Freeze, all of you! What? Freeze, all of you. Officer, I'm a social worker. I'm with these kids. Social Worker? They were arguing but it's sorted now. I don't care who you are. I suspect you illegally assembling and having a fistfight. All of you follow me over there. Officer, do you have a warrant? I'll show you when we get there! Go! I can go by myself. -Follow this way. Are you okay? Okay. Put your hands down. Put your hands down. Wow Gloves and goggles. Preparing for a war? But even with such gear you still got punched in the eye. Fuckin' roach. What are you looking at? Looking tough huh? You wanna hit officers? Stand still. You. Come forward. What's up? Are you afraid? If so, why are you here? Fuckin' roach. Your shorts are so short. Are you competing for Ms. Protest? What are you doing? None of your business. Officer, she's a girl. You can't touch her. Only a female officer can search her. Did you really see me touching her? What now? Are you teaching us how to do our job? Don't you believe I can rip you apart here? Fuckin' cunt. What did you say? I said I can rip you apart here. Fuckin' cunt. Dirty cops, may your whole family die! Sis, run now! Damn dirty cops! Don't hit my brother. Please don't. Go with them. You must find YY. Stop running! Run! Happy birthday. Lai Ka-Yan. They aren't chasing us, call Dominic the lawyer. OK. Any news from Sailor-moon rider? Can you call him? Be smarter, okay? What the hell? Why are you treating us like this? We're injuried and arrested, and you still wanna find her? Are you crazy? I treated you as my bro but you treated me like shit! Big brother. I'm leaving! Fucking crazy! Hey. Where are you going? My comrades are fighting in Sheung Wan now. Fuck! I'll come with you. Everyone's gone. How can we save anybody now? Those in Sheung Wan are comrades too. Aren't they? Could you tell me why you wanna save YY? On the night of July 21st, Louis and I charged ahead. Then the cops fired two rounds. I was so frightened I ran back straight away. And then I knocked a girl over by accident. But I was so frightened I just ran away. Then I was hit by a rubber bullet. And that girl rushed over to pull me up. That girl I knocked over was Lai Ka-Yan. If she didn't come save me, she wouldn't have been arrested. I'm such a coward. No, you are not a coward at all to me. But there's nothing we can do. We can either save Hong Kong or YY. We still have time. We can still save her. I won't go. I won't go anywhere. I won't go to the UK. If you stay here, so do I. If you wanna go save her, I'll go with you. Till we rescue her. Stairs. Lai Ka-Yan. Who're you? I'm Bell Chan. Nam's girlfriend. Could you come down first and talk to us? Where's Nam? Lai Ka-Yan. Don't climb over. This is the path I've chosen. Please leave me alone. We won't leave you. Don't give up on yourself. We still have a chance to win. Win? Our comrades are being beaten up and arrested everyday. The dirty cops face no consequences. This government is not interested in responding to us. Since they don't respond, I have to use a more radical method to make them respond. We have to use more radical methods to make them respond. But this is not the only method. Please don't abandon us. You've been quite amazing. You saved me once. Remember? Please give us a chance to help you. I can't. I can't hold on any longer. I feel suffocated. You all have family. You all have friends. I have no one. I'm all alone. You still have us. You are not alone. You could have walked away on 21st July. Why did you go back to help him? You didn't wanna abandon him, right? Lai Ka-Yan! Do you know how long I was searching for you? I'm not leaving. Please step down. Please go and leave me alone. I'm not going anywhere. Please go. You still have hope. Don't stay here. Lemme say it again. I'm not going. If we're caught, we'll be caught together. And we'll lose or win together too. Didn't you say you were unwilling to leave? Why are you giving up now? I didn't give up. You told me being unwilling to leave was useless. Then what's the use of jumping off now? Hong Kong won't change because of your death.
