Are you sure this is the right address? This is it. I could, I could drive you to the top. No, no. It's okay. I'll be all right. Dad, you can go. I have my phone. If I call you, then there's a problem. -But it's fine. -Okay. Well, I'll wait for you to get in. How is that? -Love you. -Love you, too. Hello? Is anyone there? Hello? Are you hot? What? I, I can't let you in unless you're hot. -Uh, it's Brittany. - You're Brittany? Yeah, we got a hottie here. New girl. - Have fun. -You can go. Go. -Hi. -Hi. Hey, you must be Brittany. Oh, yes. Hi. You must be Ashley's mom. It-it's nice to meet you, Mrs. Anderson. Oh, God, don't do that again please. I am so sorry. What, what did I say? "Mrs." Don't call me Mrs. My, my plastic surgeon works way too hard on this face to be called anything but Jackie. Got it? -I got it. Yeah. -Why don't you come in? Ashley's getting dressed upstairs, she'll be done in a minute. I mean, you really look more like Ashley's sister, let's be honest. Wow, okay. All right. Now you're getting it. I think I'm gonna like you. -Oh, hey, boys. -How you doing, Jackie? Did you see that? They were checking you out. -Uh, no. No, they're not. -No, they are. You know what? You need a drink. Um, what do you want? Do you want soda, uh, tequila, beer, wine, vodka, rum? -Uh, soda is great. -Soda and vodka. You're my kinda girl. Okay, I'll go get it. Wait... Jackie, where'd you go? I know, we were right in the middle of our drinking game and I was getting ready to destroy the new kid down the street. I'm-I'm sorry, this is, this is Brittany. This is one of Ashley's new friends. Um, these are my besties, Rita and Donna. Hi, Rita and Donna. -Hi, honey. -H-hi. Okay, enough with the pleasantries. -Let's get back to the party. -Okay. Uh-- Don't steal anything. -Oh, come on, get in here. -Did you notice her shoes? I mean, where did she get those, big-box? Oh, my God! Brittany! I didn't know you were gonna make it. You didn't post anything online, so... Well, I don't know. - What should I post? -Um, I don't know. Like, "Going to the best party ever at Ashley's place." Girl, you're right. I didn't even think about it. Aw, see, that's what I love about you. You're just, like, so unaware of everything going on around you. Oh. Really? Well, yeah, no, like, it's, it's really endearing. -I love it. It's super cute. - Good. Okay. Oh, hey, come on, let's go meet everybody.

Oh, I don't have a Chatter email. Uh, yeah, you do, I made it for you a few hours ago and you already have 300 followers. -Oh, my God. - Help! Somebody help!

I think he just had a little bit too much to drink. Why don't you go in to one of the guestrooms and just, and just lay down a little bit? Everybody, go have some fun! I thought you were gonna pull the plug on the whole thing. Oh, no, no, baby. Of course not. -I'm a party mom, right? -Yes, you are. Go get me a drink. We're lucky enough to be in the mountains. The high humidity is going to stick with us through the rest of the week. Temps today, downtown will be in the mid-80s, beaches will be in the upper 70s and the valley could see triple digits... Brittany. Brittany. Brittany, if you wanna get a ride to meet your friends, you gotta get up now. Brittany. Honey, I've gotta get to work! Come on. Brittany. -Come on, sleeping beauty. -Mm. Sweetie, it is now officially time... to get up. -Come on. -Mm. -Come on. -Mm... You are the one who told me to wake you. -I'll just ride-share. -No. You know I don't like those services. It's, uh, mom, it's safe. - It's a six show. -I don't need numbers, okay? It just takes one deviant to ruin your life. -Mom. -Oh, no, don't you mom me. Get up now and I will take you before my shift. Now! Ugh! Come on! It's true about teenagers. All they want to do is sleep. She was up pretty late last night. Well, what time did she finally make it home? -Uh, like, 2 a.m. -What? That is really late. -A good morning for your father? -Good morning. Such enthusiasm. Good morning, father. Ah, it's much better. -What? -I was just wondering. Are you gonna buy me a car when I turn 16? -What? -You're kidding, right? No. Why? All my friends get cars when they turn 16. Ashley drives her car all around Beverly Hills. Okay, well, this is Lake Balboa. Sweetheart, when you turn 16, you can drive one of our cars. But that's not fair. Do you have any idea how much private school's gonna cost us? More money than you could ever imagine. That's right. Why does it have to be one or the other? Because your education is more important than a car. Okay. Um... Uh, I need you ready in five minutes. Wait, five minutes? I can't be late for work. Uh, dad, can you take me? If you don't mind going through Lancaster first. -Where is Lancaster? -Exactly. Something's up with her. Just finish up. Okay, come on, get in the van. Okay. All right, so I'll just, um, see you tonight. Okay, don't let those annoying Beverly Hills women... -Oh, my gosh. -I'll try-- Can you please... Mm... We've lost our little girl. Well, she's just a teenager. I'm sure you were the same way when you were her age. No, I was perfect. Well, you're still perfect. Mm... -Okay. Have a good day. -Okay, you, too. -Bye. -Have a great day today, okay? -Be good. -All right. All right, love ya. I hope you have everything. I can't go back home. -I know I'm late again. -Yes. I, I can't be late every single day. Yeah. Okay, I'm sorry. Look, can you just drop me off at the back of the mall? Yeah, okay, fine. Are we sufficiently far enough away from your friends? I'm meeting them right here. What is it? Is it, is it the car you're embarrassed about? Is it me? Are you embarrassed about me? It's 'cause Ashley drives a Mercedes. - Emma! -She drives a Mercedes? Yes, mom, she drives a Mercedes. I told you that. It's like the one Kylie has. Look, it's not a big deal. A lot of kids in my school drive fancy cars. Mm, I get it, and you don't wanna be the one with a boring mom, who has the practical car, who's more logical and makes mortgage payments instead of car payments. Thanks for the ride. I'll see you later. Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait. -What? -What time will you be home? I don't know. I'll call you or dad. -Will you pick up if I call? -Sure, yeah. Don't do anything crazy even if those girls are doing something crazy. Yeah, okay. Good. Good. -Bye. -Okay, bye. I lov... Boy, she sure got some attitude. She's got somethin'. -Hey. -Hey! -Hi, how are you? -Oh, my God, you look so cute. Really? You think? I mean, look at you. Your purse. Guys, this is Brittany. -Hey. -Hi. And this is Lexi and Brooke. -And Alex and Ciara. -Hi. -Nice to meet you. -It's nice to meet you, guys. -I just love your shoes. -Oh, thank you. Wow. Oh, thanks. What are you doing? Uh, you know, just, uh, just doing what moms do, that's all. But we gotta get to my play date. Honey, you're 11. I think it's okay if you're a few minutes late. You're spying, aren't you? It's not spying if it's your own daughter. It's spying. Wasn't she wearing sneakers? Where did she get those heels? She's snaky. Hey, uh, Brittany, is that your mom? I could've sworn I saw that creeper van at school the other day. No, that's-that's definitely not my mom. She's at work. Yeah, I took ride-share here. -Cool. -Yeah, I use it all the time. Awesome. She caught us, mommy. Now she knows I'm always watching. She's gonna be mad, though. Oh, I don't really care if she's mad. Come on. In the back. Seat belt on. - Okay. -Tell me when. You ready? -I gotta get this. - All set. Okay, time to go. Okay, so when are you gonna buy something? Everything looks so cute on you. I don't know. I guess nothing is really just speaking to me. Really? 'Cause everything is speaking to me. Yeah. So where do you live? Uh, like, up in the valley. That area. Hidden Hills? They have their own riding rings. No. Calabasas? That place is so nice. I see it on TV, like, all the time. I live in Lake Balboa. Hey, where is that? It sounds really pretty. Yeah, it is. It's, it's really an exclusive place. -Right in the middle of valley. -Oh, cool. Well, hey, maybe we can have a party at your place some time. Yeah, that, that'd be great. So where does your dad live? Uh, Santa Barbara. I don't see him very often. Why does he live so far? He actually wanted to live farther, but my mom wouldn't let him. He, like, hates her. She took 70% of what he owns. So he lives far enough away where she doesn't come bugging him all the time, but also still kinda close so he can see me, you know, every so often. Wow. Uh, that's, that's bad. What about your parents? They've been happily married for 18 years. Wow, that's really weird, especially in LA. I hope they're not staying together for you and your sister. No, I mean, I think they actually like each other. Like a team. In fact, they love ganging up on me and making my life living hell. Yeah, well, at least they don't, uh, host your parties and try to take all your friends. Uh, it's true. Everybody calls her The Party Mom. -That's cool. -Yeah, they think it's cool. But I don't know. I think it's kinda, like, gone out of hand. I don't know. What do you think? Oh, gosh, I don't, I don't know. I mean, I wish my mom was more like that. She's so strait-laced. Maybe if we close our eyes and chant over and over again, we can, like, switch places. -Like, in all the movies. -Yes, I love this idea. -Let's do it now. -I'm really glad we met. You know, us pretty girls have to stick together. Well, you're right about that. Sale. Yeah. -Okay, okay. -Let's go, please. Come on, girls. So how was it? Did you have fun? So much fun. Did you see that house they live in? No, you can't actually see it from the street. Is it big? Dad, it's not big, it's huge. I mean, they have beautiful furniture and an enormous kitchen. Oh, my gosh. The pool. It overlooks all of Beverly Hills. -Sounds really cool. - It is. So... does a family that loves each other live there? Yeah, I, I guess. Well, I mean, her parents broke up a few years ago, but her mom seems to really love her. I mean, they go shopping, vacations, to the spa all the time. It sounds like love to me. I mean, I never actually hear her mom saying, "I love you." No? I was learning about narcissism in school last year. I think Mrs. Anderson might actually be the first narcissist I've ever met. She's that bad, huh? I don't think she cares about anyone else but herself. Not even her daughter. But don't get me wrong, okay? She's a really nice person and I think she really loves Ashley. She just doesn't show it like we do. Well, when we get home I want you to do something for me, okay? It's not my turn to take out the trash. It's not your turn to take out the trash. -Hey, babe. - Hi. There's dinner in the kitchen. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Doris, I'm-I'm sure she's fine. Okay? The-the reception is really... Hi, mom. She'll call you when she gets reception, okay? I don't know. Uh, it's not like her. Mom? Mm-hmm? Can I talk to you? I will. Okay? Don't worry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for making you drop me off at the other side of the mall. I appreciate the apology. Do you know why it hurt me so much? No. Do you notice how your father and I, all the work we do around here, everything we do is for you? Yeah, mom, I do. I don't think you do. Yes, I do, mom. Why wouldn't you let me meet your friends? Are you ashamed of me? No. Mom, I'm not, I'm not ashamed of you. You don't respect me. You don't know where Ashley's family got their money. You don't know if they inherited it, you don't know if they earned it or if they have millions or if they owe millions. But what you do know, what you see... are your parents who came from very little, who've worked very hard to build this. I know that, mom. I do. Just remember that when your friends have money, it's not their money, it's their parents' money, right? So just because they can buy a purse and you can't... that doesn't make 'em better than you. It doesn't make 'em smarter... doesn't make 'em more interesting. Honey, I don't want you to get caught up in the Beverly Hills scene that... All of that is not real, it's a facade. This should be the most important thing to you. This. Your father, your sister, me. This should be the most important thing in your life. So you're saying that you should be the only thing in my life, that I should never leave the house, I should just stay right here. -Is that what you're saying? -No, I... No, I didn't say that. So then I should get rid of the friends I have after I've worked so hard to get them. -Just throw them away. -No. I'm saying you don't have to compete with them. You don't know what it means to compete with them, mom. You don't know how hard it is with these girls. Oh, God. You just, just, you have to be strong, okay? I am strong, mom. I take care of myself all the time. What do you mean by that? When you and dad are out working all day, I'm here taking care of myself and very often, Emma, too. So do not say that I am not strong, mom. You're right. You're right, honey. You are a strong girl. Just... Please don't fall for the peer pressure. Are you done? Uh, like I said... I'm sorry. Can I go now? Sure. See you in the morning. Please don't forget to brush your teeth. I was way too harsh. Oh, she's just figuring things out. Unfortunately, it won't happen overnight. -Hm, it's hard being a parent. -Hm. -You're a good one. -Thank you. Death has risen. -Shut up. -Emma... -Honey, how'd you sleep? -Fine. Uh, I can make you something. We have eggs and bacon. Uh, we, uh, we have yogurt or, uh, well, we got the cereal. And... You know what I have? Hash browns. Your favorite. I'm gonna make you hash browns. Yeah, I'll just take coffee. Thanks. Coffee? Only adults drink coffee. You're a kid. I am an adult. Thank you. You could've fooled me. Here. You can have mine. I just made it. -It's fresh. -Thanks. When did you start drinking coffee? Today. All the girls drink it. They do it so they can stay with their homework. No... It... Just be careful 'cause it will stain your teeth. So Ashley's having a party tonight. Do you guys mind if I go? You don't have to pick me up 'cause Ashley's mom said I can spend the night. So do these guys ever stop partying? No, not really. Uh, what's the party for? For school. You don't start school for a month. So? Why not start early? So can I go? No, I think you've partied enough. I think it's time you spent some quality time with your family. In fact, I think tonight... we should have a movie night. -Yeah! -Okay. -Yeah. Right? -Totally, yes! So you're really not gonna let me go to a party with my new friends? No, because you're gonna be here, partying with your old family. But Ash is gonna think I'm a home-body. Who cares? What's wrong with that? You guys don't understand! Oh, gosh! Hey, Ash, uh, is the party still on tonight? -Yeah, I guess it is. -What does that mean? Well, it means I got into a fight with my mom. -But what's new? -Yeah, same here. Brittany? Hey, sorry. I, uh, I gotta go. -I'll call you later? - Uh, so, hey... Uh, you know, I haven't seen you all week. And it's my day off. So we could do something? What are you gonna do? Just hole up there all day? Okay, um... Well, I, uh... I just want you to know that I'm here for you, okay? If you wanna talk about anything. Oh, yeah! Oh! That smells so good! Come on. I knew you were gonna... No! You have to wait. -I get the corner. Ah! -Hey! -No fair! -Yeah! -Okay, move over. Okay. -Come on, get in here. Why don't you go ask your sister what she wants to watch? -Okay. -Hurry! - Okay, thank you. -Thank you. Take your time. You're sneaky. What are you doing? You can't just barge in to my room! Okay. So what movie do you wanna watch? Scary, adventure, sci-fi or romantic? I'm not watching any movie, sorry, I'm staying right here and figuring out my wardrobe for the upcoming school year. -Okay, whatever. -Just go! Yeah. Whoo! She doesn't wanna hang with us. - That's fine. - Okay. If you need some time to yourself... That means you get to pick the movie. - Really? -Mm-hmm. -Yes. -Okay. You ready? Ooh, what do you think? - Somethin' funny? Yeah. - Oh, yeah. Okay, and I will now share the popcorn. -Thank you. -It's official. What are we gonna watch? Beverly Hills, huh? Yeah.

Yeah, sorry I had to go. But I'm spending the night tonight, so there's no rush. I find you very attractive. -You do? - Come on. I have a question for you, though. -Okay. -How old are you? What difference does it make how old I am? -I mean, I'm only 15. -Okay. So? So you're probably a lot older than me, like, statutory-rape older than me. Uh, well, I feel like it depends a lot more of how you feel, really.

You told mom it was too much money to go to the movies. -Yeah. It don't mean... -Yeah, right. You know, it's been kinda quiet upstairs. Do you think we should check on her?

I didn't do it. And you're gonna clean it up. Mm, well... Shh, be quiet, she's sleeping. I'm sure she's exhausted from using her thumbs on social media all night. Hm.

This is not embarrassing. Everybody loves... Can you just keep your voice down, please? I don't feel good. Oh, my God, I don't feel good. Ugh. Oh, they're gonna bust the party. Okay, if...

Oh, my God. -Okay. -I'm, I'm sorry. But you're not allowed past this point. No, doctor, this is my daughter. -I'm sorry. Hospital rules. -I, I...

I wanna talk to your superior. -I do not belong here. -Yes, you do. -You're going in here. -No, I don't. -Let's go. -Please, I... -Hold her. -I'm not going in this cell. -Yes, you are. -I'm not going in this cell. Let's go. Come on, calm down. -Please, please. -Let's go. Please, please. Please don't leave me in here. Why do I have to stay here? Please. Talk to the judge in the morning about your bail hearing. No. Don't leave. Please. This has been a huge misunderstanding. Oh, my God. Dr. Murphy, please come to the third floor pharmacy. Dr. Murphy, please come to the third floor pharmacy. Those kids at that party. There was so much alcohol. There was a keg. Mr. and Mrs. Thompson? Your daughter is now stable. Although, she sustained some serious injuries. Brittany has a broken femur, broken arm, three broken ribs and serious internal injuries which we operated on. And unfortunately, she might need an additional surgery. Now, during this healing process, we'll have to watch carefully for infection. Uh, we, can we see her or... She should be waking up from the anesthesia about now. Follow me. Okay. Gary. How did we let this happen? We didn't. It was an accident. It wasn't an accident. Drunk driving is not an accident that can... They got drunk at that house and they went and drove. Well, this is stupid. Baby... Baby, it's mommy and daddy. -We're here. -Hm. Hi. Hi. -I'm sorry. -No, honey. Shh, shh, shh. It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay. Everything's gonna be fine. We're not gonna leave you. Dr. Wyatt to Radiation immediately. Dr. Wyatt to Radiation immediately. Mrs. Anderson? -Mrs. Anderson? -Mm. Your bail hearing's in thirty minutes. Oh, my God. The judge will decide if you're a danger to run. Come on. A danger to run? -Yes. Come on. -Oh, God. -Let's go. -Ah. Danger to run. There we go, come on. -Have you seen these heels? -Let's go. -I'm not going anywhere. -Let's go. Come on. Watch it. Watch it. Through the door. Let's go. Can I get some water or something, please? Yes, we'll get you what you... Yup, hold on. Let's go. -Uh... -All right. Is it okay if I get sick? -Let's go. -Hm. I just... I need something, I need, I need water. The five of you were arrested in the last 24 hours and charged with crimes. You are here today for your first-appearance hearing. The purpose of this hearing is to tell you what crimes you are accused of and whether you are eligible for bail today. Today's hearing is not to determine guilt or innocence. After review of your criminal record and the charges against you, the court will make a decision about whether to grant bail, how much bail will be or whether to deny bail. Does everyone understand? -Yes. -Yes, Your Honor. Mrs. Anderson. -Please stand. -Yes. You are charged with, "Furnishing alcoholic beverages to persons under 21 and involuntary manslaughter." Your warrant states that, "In violation of State Code 3323 and State Code 1653, subject did provide alcohol to persons under the age of 21 at a party. After which, four teenagers left the party and were involved in a fatal automobile accident. Three of them died and the fourth is in critical condition." Do you understand the charges against you today? I understand the charges, but this is ridiculous. Do you understand that the involuntary manslaughter charge is a very serious felony? Yes, I am quite aware that involuntary manslaughter is serious. I'm not an idiot. If found guilty, you could serve from one to ten years for each of the victims. Understood, but that is not gonna happen. I am confident that I will be not guilty. But because your criminal record is clear, I will consider granting you bail today. However, the court has been informed that a parent of one of the victims would like to address the court concerning the matter of bond. Would the witness please stand up and state your name? Uh, yes, Your Honor, that's me. I'm Caroline Thompson. Our daughter, Brittany, is the only survivor of last night's car accident. Um, I-I wanted to address the court regarding Ms. Anderson's bail. You may proceed, Mrs. Thompson. I realize, Your Honor, that her charges are not violent ones, that she didn't have a gun as a weapon, but I-I'm very concerned that if you let her go, she's just gonna go right back to serving minors alcohol and drugs. I object! I ob... I... Your Honor, please. I object to this. This woman does not know me and she doesn't know my daughter. I don't know what's wrong with her. She's had something against me for a while, apparently. She doesn't even know what she's talkin' about. Look at her. She looks like she shops at an outlet mall. - Mrs. Anderson. -Come on. You cannot object to a witness' request for a denial of bail. In fact, you cannot interrupt the witness at all. And if you do so again, I will hold you in contempt of court. Please proceed, Mrs. Thompson. Your Honor, I'm, I'm concerned that she's dangerous. I made a very big mistake letting my daughter spend time at her house that she almost paid for it with her life. Judge, if you could just please keep her locked up until her trial, I'm, I'm afraid that she's gonna resume her reckless ways and she's gonna endanger other teenagers. And lives could be lost. I completely understand, Mrs. Thompson, but because Mrs. Anderson has no criminal record and there are no indications that she's likely to reoffend, the court will grant her bail at this juncture. However, to ensure that Mrs. Andersen returns to stand trial, the court will set a significant bail amount. The bail will be $100,000. Next. A Mr. Flubacker. -Please stand. - Yes, Your Honor. You are charged with armed robbery. Your warrant states that, "In violation of State Code 16841, subject did take property from a person by use of an offensive weapon. Last night at 11:50, subject..." Have you done anything since I've been in jail, Ashley? Are you serious? Really? Do you even understand what I've been through because of the mess that you created? I'm sorry. What you... I just spent the night in jail, Ashley. -The mess that I created? -Yeah. Ashley, the-these are your friends. These are, these are your friends. The came over to my house to get drunk. Well, they're teenagers. You're the parent. You were the one that was buying all the alcohol. Did you ever think that this could happen? Did that ever occur to you? No, Ash, it didn't. It didn't. I assumed that your friends' parents would know if their children weren't responsible young adults and they wouldn't let them come over to the house. Oh, my God. Are you serious? Wow, you still don't get it. What are you doing, mom? You're going to jail! No, I'm not. I'm not going to jail, Ashley. My attorneys are gonna get me off, you'll see. I'm gonna be okay. I promise you. Okay? Mom, three kids died! My friends. Okay? And Brittany got thrown from a car. She could have died, too. I know. But I will not let this destroy me, Ashley. I didn't let your father destroy me and I'm not gonna let this destroy me, either. Do you even have any remorse for those kids and their families, what they're going through? Um, of course, I do. Of course, I do, Ashley, but there's nothing I can do about it, babe. They're dead. Wow. -I'm done. -"Wow" what? You're done what? What, Ashley? I thought you were so awesome, mom. You know, I thought you were the cool mom, the party mom. But you know what? No. You're the self-centered mom. -Ashley! -No, you know what? No! You're not even a mom at all! These last 16 years when I needed you to be a parent to take care of me, you let me to care of myself. You're not a mom at all! And you know what? You make me sick. I don't even wanna look at you anymore. I going to live with dad and that's it. No, you're not going to live with your dad. Ashley, that is the stupidest thing you have ever said. You don't even mean that, baby. Ashley! Ashley, you can't leave me. Ashley! Ashley! -Are you okay? -Yeah. What's wrong? I just love you so much. Oh, sweetheart... Oh, honey. -It's okay. - I'm sorry. I was so mean to all of you guys. Can you please forgive me? Yeah, we can forgive you, sweetheart. You're growing up and you're trying new things and... we understand that. Okay? We always have your best interest in mind, you know? -So do I. -Thanks, cutie. I love you, too. Hey. Can I come in? - You okay with it? -Yeah, yeah. It's okay. Sure. -Hey, Brittany. -Hey. I just wanted to say that I'm really sorry. I was a really bad friend to you and you didn't deserve that. I just hope you can forgive me. Of course, I can. Thanks. And, um... I'm gonna go live in Santa Barbara with my dad after my mom's hearing. She made me feel like he was such a bad guy and I never actually found out for myself. So I'm really excited. You know, I think he does really love me. I'm happy for you, Ashley. Well, I'll let you get some rest. Feel better. The case we are here for today is between the city of Los Angeles and the four families involved with this horrific accident. And the defendant, Jacqueline Anderson. Now, Ms. Anderson, you are hereby charged with the following crimes. "California Penal Code 25658, furnishing minors with alcohol, contributing to the delinquency of a minor. CPC 272. The health and safety code violation. 11361... Giving drugs to a minor..." Thank you, everyone, for your patience. It appears that the jury has completed their deliberation and has come back with their decision. "On count one, providing minors with alcohol, not guilty. On count two, contributing to the delinquency of a minor, not guilty. On count three, indecent intoxication in the presence of a minor, not guilty. On count four, involuntary manslaughter, not guilty. I don't wanna... I gotta get outta here. -Uh, oh, my God. -Congratulations. Oh, my God. This is amazing. Oh, my God, baby. Yeah! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. How does an entire jury not clearly see how irresponsible that woman is? She's a complete menace to society. She doesn't care about anyone but herself. You know, it's her money. The lawyers made a mockery of the system. These people don't... She bought the alcohol. If she hadn't bought it, those kids would still be alive. God, I've never hated anybody like I hate her. Vigilante justice. I mean, I, I get it now. -I see why people go off... -Honey. We're lucky. We have our daughter. Those other families don't have their kids. We have to remember that. No... She almost killed our daughter! I need to go over there and I need to tell her exactly how I feel, Caroline. -No. -What? She needs to know that we think that she's a murderer. I think we should stay way clear-- -What? What is gonna happen? - I don't trust her. Listen, Caroline. I have to let her know how I feel. No, Gary, don't, nothing good is gonna come if you go over there. No. It's fine. Okay? You stay here and watch Brittany. Okay? I'm just gonna talk to her. It's gonna be fine. Okay? Ga... Be safe. Ashley, this is for Travis. This is for Dillon. This is for Sasha. And this is for Brittany. Gun. Where's my gun? Where is it? Where's my gun? Oh. look. Hello? Put your hands up. Hands up. -I think she needs help. -Sir, put your hands up now. Look, I just found her. I just... -Get down! -Oh, my God. Face on the floor! You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to a lawyer. If you cannot afford a lawyer, one will be appointed for you. Do you understand what I just said to you? Yes. Oh. I'm so glad that we are here tonight and celebrating. And honestly, I, I couldn't have done it without you guys. I appreciate you so much. And thank you so much for supporting me and loving me. And I am with all of you and I am not sitting in a jail cell. It means everything in the world to me. And you stayed with me through this and I couldn't have done it without you. Thank you so much. Cheers, everybody. - Cheers. -This is such a celebration. Yay, cheers. Ahh! Okay, no worries. Why don't you just have a seat? And I will finish this drink and we'll head out, okay? There's a problem at your house. We have to leave now. Okay, that does not sound good. Um, you guys enjoy yourself. I will be back later. Jackie, put down your drink. I have your phone. We need to leave. -We're leaving now. -Excuse me. Um... Drinks, get as much as you want. It's on me. Um, I will call you later. You're being very harsh. I don't appreciate... That was very embarrassing back there. I don't know, just... What's happening? What, what's going on? What's going on? What's happening? Tell me, what, what is... I'm sorry. -What is happening? What's... -Ma'am, please. What? Is that my... Move out of my way. Is this my daughter? Oh, my God! Oh! Oh, my God! What happened? There seems to be an intruder. My baby! Oh, my God! We have a man in custody. A man by the name of Gary Thompson. Does that name ring a bell with you, ma'am? Corner of 1076, over. That is Brittany's father. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Ash... -Oh, my God, Ashley. -I'm so sorry, ma'am. Oh, my God! My baby, no, no... They couldn't just accept the decision? It was the jury. It was, it was the jury that was made up of trash, just like them. I mean, it was their peers, it wasn't ours. And they still couldn't accept it. It doesn't make sense. Why would Gary kill Ashley? Ashley and Brittany were friends. Are you stupid? He did not come here to kill Ashley. He came here to kill me. He took something precious from me. And I am going to take something precious from him. You mark my words! Jackie, please, calm down. Calm down? You want me to calm down? My daughter is dead. My daughter is dead and you want me to calm down? Get out of my house! Just go! You're not helping. You're not helping. Leave! It's okay. It's okay. -We're here. -We love you. We love you. Hello? Hey, Caroline, it's me. Oh, Gary. Where are you? Are you okay? I'm okay. Uh, I'm... I'm downtown. Don't get upset, but I, I've been arrested. What? You got arrested? What? Well, Gary, what did you do? I didn't do anything. Okay? I showed up at Jackie's house and, uh... Yeah. And? And I found Ashley. She was... She was dead. -What? -She was shot. There was, there's blood everywhere. What? Gary, tell me you didn't have anything to do with that. What? No. Of course, I didn't do that. I'm innocent. Look, everything's gonna be fine, Caroline. Okay? I... I don't... I told you not to go there, honey. -I told you. -I know. I, I... Look, I'm sorry, okay? I let my emotions get the best of me. All right? I'm sorry. But I did not do this. Listen, I talked to my sister and she said she'd come to the hospital and look after Brittany. Why don't you go home and, and take care of the babysitter? I'm sure Emma's worried sick. Okay. I love you. I love you, too. Gary Thompson, you're free to go. I'm sorry, what? Time to go. You're taking up space. Really? Well, uh, what happened? Well, we found the weapon at the house and we traced it back to the father of the girl who was killed in the accident. Wow. Really? Yeah. Obviously, he wasn't happy about the decision, either. We think he went down there to kill Ms. Anderson and then ended up killing Ashley instead. Hm, that's terrible. Sorry about the inconvenience, but I'm sure you understand. Yeah, I do, I... Yeah, I wish I could have got there earlier. Maybe I could have saved her. You might have been killed. You should be happy you're alive. We have some paperwork for you to sign. -Gary? - They let me out, babe. -I'm coming home. -Oh, God. That's so good. What happened? It was Sasha's father. The police think he went there to kill Jackie, but shot Ashley instead. Oh, God. That's awful. Two more lives destroyed by all this. Yeah, I know. All right, I love you. I'll see you soon. -I love you. -I love you. -Drive safely. -I will. Do you know how much I love you? Oh, I have to. It's the law. Uh, Emma, I want you to go upstairs and lock the door. Go now! Caroline? Caroline? -Caroline? -Hang on! -Hang on! -Open the door. Stop knocking. What can I do for you, Jackie? Oh, God. My Ashley is dead. I know, I... I know, Jackie. I'm sorry. How is your daughter doing? -She's okay. Yeah. -Yeah? And she's alive, right? Yeah, she's alive. Can I ask you a question? Sure. Do you think I'm guilty? I do. You're the one who let them drink at your house. Right? And then they went off and drove. -Yes, I think you're guilty. -You're blaming me for this? Yeah, 'cause they could've gotten alcohol somewhere else? It's your fault. Do you also think that it's my fault that your husband murdered my daughter? -Jackie... -What? He didn't kill her. Yes, he did. The police arrested him. Jackie, I think if you just, maybe, sober up a little bit, okay, then you can see the truth. Your husband murdered my daughter. He did not. And now I am going to take something from him. Jackie... Oh, my God! -Oh, my God! -Let go of the gun. -Oh. Damn it, Jackie. -Let go of the gun, Caroline. -Let go of the gun. -Jackie... What is wrong with you valley people? -Put the, put the gun down! -What is wrong with you? Why did you have to come to Beverly Hills? Your daughter doesn't belong in Beverly Hills. She belongs here in the valley with the losers that are here. -All of this is because of you. -Put it down. All of this is because of your daughter. Do you understand me? Why did you come? Why didn't you, why didn't you stay here? Help me! Put it down. This is all your... No. You come to my house, attack my wife? -Get off me. - Gary! -No! -You killed my daughter! -I didn't, but I will kill you. -Gary, don't. Gary, stop it! -Gary! -Do what you can. -Gary, Gary, don't shoot her! -She deserves to die. Don't! Put the gun down. I will make sure you go to prison for life. Come here. Come here. -That is really nice. -Oh. - Brittany! -Hi. You look so good. Thanks, I actually feel a lot better. -How'd it go, doc? -The surgery was a success. All of her internal organs are working fine and her bones are mending perfectly. She should be out of the hospital in less than a week. -That is really good news. -Thanks for everything. Oh, you're very welcome. I'll leave you guys alone. -Thanks, doctor. - I'm gonna be fine. Of course, you are. -Of course, you are. -Hey. I missed you. Guard? Hello? Guard, can you hear me? Get me out of here, please! This jumpsuit is giving me a rash. I haven't had filtered water. I need that. Guard! Shut up! I don't have gluten-free food. It's terrible. I'm bloated.
