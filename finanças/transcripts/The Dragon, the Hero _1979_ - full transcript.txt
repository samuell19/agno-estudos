Centuries ago, the legendary priest Shao Lin created the all-powerful Shao Lin Strike Rock Fist. In the sixth generation of his line, Too Kwang and Tong Soon went further to perfect the Double Strike Rock Fist. They defeated all other fighters and gained fame throughout the land. At the height of their fame and glory, they turned on one another, each struggling in vain for ultimate supremacy. In the passion and depth of their struggle, the very art that had raised them to such Olympian heights was lost. Their techniques vanished. 20 dollars, hey. that's a lot of money. That's all right. Why don't you have a go? You know what the rules are? Mm. You understand. This 20 dollars is not easy to come by. We both know how the mountain was moved. I've never been beaten with my technique. Let's begin. So. The monkey comes to the mountain. I picked him just for you. Now win your prize. But, I can't fight him. This is not a whore's den, to pick and choose. Get fighting. Wow, you'll pull all my fingers off. Ah! Wow, I must pick your fruits! And now your melons! Now, please Eight and a half. Very good, very good, very good. For you, master. The way you exit won't be the way you go. You watch, an even better time. Go on. A shame We'll wait to see who shakes the most. Well done. The money's yours. Thanks. This will do, to pay my trip back home. Until next time, my friend. I suppose your next time will come quite soon. I met you. What's your name? Knowing my name will not lengthen your life. Huh, what do you mean? That's all the time left for you to live. Don't kill yourself. You better enjoy it. Because it's your last chance to fight. Who has taught you my technique? I've waited long for your Tiger Fist. And now the tiger won't have a chance. We shall see! This little coin will pay your trip to hell. There you are, and I hope you'll find fortune as the wind wind spins your wheel. You are so dumb. I want fortune to come. The fortune of a child. Otherwise, my husband looks outside. Good for him. With a windmill, you'll have fortune and a new child. Won't she? Oh, yes. With a windmill, you'll be as pregnant as an old cow. You make fun of me. I know when I'm being joked with! Hmm! That silly old bitch. You've got a nerve, groping with your arm. Sure, I'm groping, is that right? You know that's right. Blow your fat face. Ah. - Thank you. - Sure. You coward. What are they? Eh, windmill. Oh. Here, sir, they bring good fortune as they whirl and twirl with the wind. Honest, they'll bring you luck. Go on, buy one. If you ask me, it's all some sort of bullshit. Keep your trash. Asshole, asshole. What did he say? Asshole. You silly peacock! Silly old man! Grandfather! Settle down, don't worry. Here's your grandfather. That's right, me too! Grand... Father. Lousy punk! That's hardly fair. Who are those dirty cowards? Guests of old man Win. - You okay? - Yes. Grandfather! Full-grown idiots. Picking on a child. And you, another child. I'm tempted to send my men after you. You don't scare me. You squawk like a chicken. Come on! You and your cowards, you'll suffer for this. Why that's, no wise man fights in the morning. Grandfather! Do you feel okay, old man? Me bench! No worries, we'll have it. We gave 'em what they deserved! We could have given them more. It's you. Now I'm in a vicious mood, back off! I detest you, beggar. With so much pride, now, go. Hmm. Oh, my hand! Get him! Yes, my Snake Fist will bite! It will be you. Wow. Yes, I, whose work is this? I'll tell you, it's those two. Oh, please, my gentlemen, can't you be good here, in front of our foreign master? Please. Good morning sir. I'm so terribly sorry for the rude manners of these young men. I want those two to apologize. Yes, of course. And what more do you two need to hear? Go on. Sorry. Let it be. I want more than that! I want three beat eggs. Something wrong? Huh? Wah! If you dare to hit him, you know that I'll fire you. All right, calm down then. I was not in the wrong. Just apologize. Uncle will forgive everything. Never. His house has takes no honor in being Chinese. I can't return. The dishonor is real. It's settled then. You can't return, and so you won't. Besides, why should you annoy uncle? You'll go on your own then, huh? That's it. Uncle doesn't own us. All right then. Always together. Always. We must wait for Chief Inspector before we do anything. Stand aside. Suppose you make me. Not one has made me. But perhaps you'll be the first. Though it would surprise me. Bullshit! Challenge me now. Challenge the one who will pass. Dying time. Pentacle style. Ho there. Who are you? A merchant. Maybe your goods are in this bag. No business here. No business here! And why not? Because you annoy me. Now feel this! Uh, mother. My Now you! Yes, boy? I give my challenge. When shall I fight? And who? Oh, poor boy, are you sure? Yes, I am very sure. Give me my chance. Take my challenge. Oh, come. I'm sure that we have your match. Find another. Challenge me. Just you with them. Attack! Stop! Now, you have beaten how many? Triple victory wins you 60 dollars. Take it. Take that one, and two more. That is the prize you've just earned. So take two, and... What is this, money? All for you. It's nothing to me. Rubbish! What did you say? Simple money is nothing to one who wanders, like me. Is that so? And who are you? That's who I am. Do you know the face? A fugitive? Yes, a fugitive. Will you employ me? Huh, let me read your name. So you've seen it all. If you trust me, let me stay. If you don't, don't bother. All right! If you want this home, you have it. The Fighting Dragon does not keep company with worms. They must go. Oh. Well perhaps they will not complain. You're finished here, go. Practice a lot? Enough. But I don't ask for an audience. I see you're using old style. I wondered where you'd learned it from. You know very well. It's yours too. I've forgotten. Will you show me? And what have you come for? You come here, since you're so interested. Fight me. Your feet only now. Tell me, are your arms broken? I'll prove that they're still in use. You're quite good. You should challenge Tang, he uses the same technique. That kung fu technique is called. Strike Rum. Who taught you it? Tu Kang? Well? Do you know him? He's my father. Right, then it's up to me to take revenge for my father. Listen, let's let bygones be bygones. We shouldn't die because of the last generation. Bullshit! My kung fu improves every hour. Soon I will be invincible. There's no way I'll give the money to you. Why should I put the money down? What happens if you take it? Why not pay when you deliver? Yes? That's right. We will pay you, after you come with the antiques you promised us. Right, and that will be a long ceremony, every one of us. Once the goods have been delivered, I think we can agree upon that. That way, we'll all have what we want. I remember. It wasn't easy stealing them. The government is still looking everywhere for them. I have to be absolutely certain of complete and utter secrecy. One second. You don't have to worry, I'll take care of the government. We'll stick to our bargain. You give me the goods, I give you the 100,000. Good, if you can handle the government, there's no problem, right? That's right. What the hell are you doing practicing? Well you have been fired. He is doing bad. Wait, you better get down, and show your respect. No thanks. Asshole! Excellent. Soh Feng, you have created your very own brand of kung fu using all styles. Do you realize how important this will make me become? You have no need to worry, my style won't be overcome. My kung fu is faster now than ever. Imagine it, this power all to myself. I don't need to worry about anything while you are still around to protect me. Eh? You'd better be very careful. Why? Because of Tu Wu Shen. Better leave him to me. Ah. That would be interesting, Tu and you fighting. It would be fair, you're both very good at fighting. I have a bad feeling about him. Stay there. You won. Try me again. All right. Use them all, go ahead. God damn you, I'll show you. Huh? Try some more. You're mad, you can catch all these goddamn plates. Huh? If both of you catch all these plates you'll get 60 yen. Watch it, the boss! You're a filthy little slut. Now, go. Sit down. Master. Now then. I hear you've been fighting with Tang. Is that correct? Master, your information is perfectly correct. What do you think of his fighting? We met quite by accident. He uses a Shaolin Rock Fist. But then, he could use a little practice. The men who are following Tang are nothing but a good laugh. I hate people who are doing good. But then they could, they might even beat us. I'll fight them with all my energy! Beat them senseless! But then I always worry, just what might happen because of his kung fu. There's no need to worry. If he is good, then we will better than good. And no one will beat us. But I am very lucky to have such good fighters. Yes, master. You have only the very best. Master, he must be dreaming. Well, if he's dreaming, then he must be asleep. And if he's asleep, then I will wake him up. Who is gonna take this? You call this medicine? It would be better, not to know who's taking this. All right. I shall trace this prescription. You tell me, who uses a bowl like this? Only one person. And he is your master. So all this medicine is for the master. I wasn't here. I'm sure you understand. Well now, how disappointing. Goodbye then. I brought you your medicine. Very good. It's all right, I'm here. He's mad. You mad bastard! How dare you treat a woman like that. She belongs to me! She's mine! Nobody's your property, no one ever will be! Go out, you will not stay here any longer with him. Guards! Please be calm. Oh, please, please let us go! Ah Tien, what's this then? Ah Tien! Ah Tien, who did this? Who did this to you? It was a man in white. It's you! Wait! Hey! Tu Wu Shen, you hurt Ah Tien! Stop it! You are mistaken. Dirty bastard! Wait a second. I've never tried to harm him. You lie, you filthy liar. Last night, you tried to kill him, and you nearly succeeded. You are both mistaken. You are, for not having left here. All right, you can have it your way. Now, you see what happens your way? Get up. We'll see about that. You must be able to do better than that. If you practiced, you'd win. Damn you, you bastard! Get up. Friend, is it worth getting up? You are mistaken that I hurt Ah Tien. So why should I hurt you? You could have died for nothing. Teacher! Right, you find your teacher. Teacher! Teacher! Teacher? There's absolutely no point in crying over spilled milk. You came here because you've been defeated. All right. Teacher, it was Tu Wu Shen. Tu Wu Shen is the son of Tu Kang. It is impossible. Though both of you are learning the same technique, you should be ashamed of yourself, for being beaten by that man. Teacher, he's using some unusual forms, the Mysterious Hand, and others I'd never seen before. Teacher! Ha ha ha, the Mysterious Hand is a soft technique. The hand acts like a soft but extremely powerful fan. Look! And the movements will hypnotize you so that you don't know what you're doing at all. The movements confuses the person and within a split second he can be defeated. Master! Like so. Master. But his legs also have power. His kung fu is the best I have known. Teacher, please will you show me how to beat his kung fu? I must learn. All right. So you want to be able to beat his hands and his legs? So, you must train yourself first. So that you will not be tricked by his techniques. Good boy. Don't be lazy. Teacher. Boys. You sit down. Teacher, do I have to continue? If you don't work hard, you will not progress. Teacher. Now, let's get this straight. I'm to hide the message in the bamboo. Right, you're right. Cheers. - Cheers. You say, once I've done that, that's all I have to do? Am I right? Yep. That is all. Bottoms up. Teacher, I... Tang, I try to teach you kung fu and you make fun of me! Ah. Young man, your legs are getting much better. 500 seals of gold. You can keep your bargain? You can bet on it. We will be ready, don't you worry about it. You shall have your antiques. "After the deal is made," "wait for them in the old house." "Everything's going according to plan." It is time! Come out! Tu Wu Shen, you're challenged. So it is you, you have come for the money. But you can't fight. We are not paying today. We are busy. Why not come back again tomorrow? Damn you, I don't want your filthy money! You're foolish. I knew that you would come. Tu Wu Shen, I want to challenge you a second time, and this time I will win. You wanna fight? All right! Well, your eyes now done seen my fists. Not a bad leg technique. I have a good teacher. Marvelous! A really good technique. You flatter. We are both equal in kung fu. Wouldn't it be wise, if we forgot the past? We shall meet again some day. Goodbye. And so shall we. Wait! Stay and be my fighter! You've gotta be joking. Hmm? Carter! I'll use him to test my kung fu. Hey, don't worry. He refused to work for me! Tien Hao, don't worry, I'll help you to take your revenge. Go to it! You teach that bastard I'm not to be messed with. We'll be very rich, when the antiques arrive, very, you know? Yes, you'll be rich. When is the boat arriving? It will arrive at 12. You can inspect the goods, the bargain will be completed. Good. When we've finished, I'll go and get myself a blonde. Huh, what's a blonde? I've heard of dragons and even snakes, tigers, but never a blonde. Hey, what? You mean to tell me that you've never heard of a blonde woman? The blonde is a woman with golden hair. Golden hair. I like this! My friends, the time has come. Hey, what do you want? What does your master Wen Tien Hao want? Calm down. Tien Hao does not want anything. Is this how you people do business? Now listen. I have never been with those people. Who do you think you are, huh? I am from the government, to investigate smuggling. I've been trying to get close to you, so that I can find the antiques you've been waiting for. All right? Kill him! It's all finished. ♫ I was born to wandering ♫ I was born under a wandering star ♫ Come on, Percy. Wait, wait, wait, you can't drink that! Triple cross die. Hey, you two! Hey! Moving again? We're going home. We resign, because the boss works us too hard. And why should we, huh? Mah Tee, can you handle three? I kill at least in threes. It's all right. Man wants to try his kung fu today. Right? You, you're first. Go get him! You'd better say your prayers. Strike Rock Fist. Now watch my style! Oh, God, that one's so disgusting. Let's kill the monster. Two hats, one for sun and one for rain. Here are your hats. You shouldn't have taken them. Hey. Now! You dirty bastard! You're gonna die! Stop it! You ought to be put down! You've got rabies. Brother! No! You are a mad dog! I must kill you. It's not your lucky day. Come on! Tien Hao, let's play a game with our guinea pig. Dog technique. The premier of the Mad Dog technique. Thank you. So, Win Tien Hao, and Mah Tee. He's a spy from the government. Tien Hao, you are wrong this time. Well then, the antique smugglers and Mah Tee and We Tien Hao. Carter's been captured. And you will not get away. And what if we want to try? Tang, I assume you will help me. I have been waiting for you to ask me. Two guinea pigs. I don't have any! Tu Wu Shen, I have a principle. When the sand is done, my eagle's claw will have won. My friend, I also have a principle. You're dead, when the sand doesn't run. When this finishes, you'll know. Well done, Ah Tien, keep an eye on this monster for me. Don't you worry, go help, go on. Right. You are a mad dog that ought to die! You're not so great. You can be beaten. Quite an exotic mover. I am totally invincible. Once too often, you have boasted. Be ready for the chop. My crane. Sudden Death Trap. I took it from him, the old criminal, just before he died. My superior kung fu will finish you off. The Double Strike Wall. Come on, let's go! Let's get him! Get the bastard! Go get him! He will win, unless he is off-balance, off-balance, off-balance. - Hit his legs! - Knock him over!
