Despite possible coincidences, this film is fictional. Rio de Janeiro present time We'll wait behind the hospital. Tell us when he comes out, ok? He's going to the parking lot. Attention. He's coming out. This may look like an American movie cliche but it's when facing death that we understand life. I beat up a lot of junkies. I took down many crooked cops. I sent a ton of thugs into a ditch. But it was nothing personal. Society prepared me for this. And a mission assigned, my friend, is a mission accomplished. Elite Squad 2: the Enemy Within Special Ops. (BOPE) You'll never be one of us! Talk, talk! Who's the killer? Tell me! - Tell me you want out! - No, sir! If not, you're out! ...that I'm about to have a son. She has two kids! I tried to save my family... I left a guy I trusted in my place. Didn't work out, and I came back. I was with BOPE many years. I commanded the unit. Fought until the end. I'd still be with BOPE, if not for what happened... at the Penitentiary La?rcio da Costa Pellegrino... better known as "Bangu One". (Bangu One, 4 years earlier) - Big Curi?. - Hey! How you doing? - All good? - Quiet. Enough work there? This is where the drug lords ended up... Hey, partner. ...the guys that the police caught and didn't execute... because they had a lot dough to lose. - All good here? - All good. Each drug gang was put in its own isolated wing. If left to mix, these punks would kill each other. You know what they did inside? The same as outside. They were at war, vying for control of trafficking in the city. If up to me, I'd lock them up, throw away the key... and let them slaughter each other inside. But there are liberal intellectuals... who make a living defending these punks. What's worse is that they get into the heads of many people. ...the craziest thing we've been discussing is that prison today... is a place that costs enormously... only to make people worse. And look what more and more... Fraga lived to call me a fascist but didn't have the courage to tell it to my face. When we spoke face to face, he pretended to respect me. And the fucked-up thing is I had to do the same. ...Just to give you an idea, in 1996... the Brazilian prison population was 148,000 prisoners. Today, 10 years later, the prison population... is over 400,000 prisoners. It's more than double. It's almost triple. I made a calculation. It's perverse, I have it here. Obviously, doesn't make sense. Picture this, a history professor doing math. What a disaster. But this one I must make sure to share with you... which is that I noticed... that the Brazilian prison population... doubles, on average, every 8 years. While the Brazilian population... doubles every 50 years. If we continue this way, in 2081... the Brazilian population will be 570 million... in other words, your kids, grandkids, and great-grandkids, while the Brazilian prison population... will be 510 million. Your children, grand-children, and great-grandchildren! In other words, 90% of Brazilians will be in prison. Can you picture it? Huh, J?lia? Is this the retirement you had in mind? But listen, don't worry, don't worry... because this situation here gets better. In 2083, all Brazilians will be living here. In a gated community like this one here. Bangu One, our first maximum security prison. - What's up, Curi?. - Hey, how's it going? I'm gonna fix a problem with Beirada... - but it's all good, ok? - That's cool, partner. Here inside, ladies and gentlemen... are the 40 guys considered the most dangerous... in Rio de Janeiro. 40! Ali Baba is outside. He's at the palace. But the 40 are inside, guaranteed. Waddup. Yo, Curi?. What you got for us? What's up, Beirada. Here, as we agreed... - Gimme. - Here are the pieces. Here, hold this. All good, right? Yo, I'm checking it's all here. Tie him there. If you pay attention, Bangu One will remind you of reality today in our city. Rio de Janeiro today is, let's put it this way,... divided into 3 criminal factions in constant conflict... and Bangu One is exactly the same thing ... - Tie him there. 3 criminal factions feeding the hatred... and rivalry among them. Goddamn it, Beirada, what the fuck? "What the fuck" is a shitload. Shut up, shut your mouth. You're getting a shitload of dough. Real quiet. Kids, quiet, ok. Quiet. A miserable bunch... who never had a chance at education... who never had any chance in life... locked and forgotten in the worst conditions imaginable... and controlled by police... with strong tendencies toward corruption. Beirada is out. Notify the authorities Bangu One's blowing up. Oh, and bring me coffee. Hard bread sucks. - It's Qual? that I want! - Easy, easy! Out of the way, move, move, move. Move, goddamn it. Sit down! So you were gonna kill me? You gonna die. You gonna get it in the ass. - I'm just a soldier, yo. - That's the fucker. - I'm just a soldier. - He's the boss. Yet, some folks still open their mouths to say... Brazil's the country of inpunity. It may even be, for one particular sector of society. Because for the others, for the working classes... for mere mortals, there's hell to pay. Put this shit in. Put him in the oven. - Come on! - Go to hell, cocksucker. The guy's gonna die! Hey, man, you fattened the pig, now we're gonna roast it! There, get the mattress there. Bring it, bring it. Go in, go in. Rap?, soak him. - Our time, boss. - Soak him. Now you'll... Our time. Bath time. ...learn how to roast pork, motherfuckers. - Bath! - Soak him. Now let's go to the Third. Let's get that motherfucker over there. You're surrounded. You can't escape. Sons of bitches. - Red assholes. - I'm going to shoot. Pieces of shit. Whoever fears death, homes, shouldn't be born. Got it?! We're at war! - Open this shit there, son. - Let's fucking go! What, bro? Go fuck yourself, son! I don't negotiate with police. Go to hell. If you come in, everyone will die. Negotiate my cock! Call Fraga, call Fraga... I don't negotiate with police. Open this shit, kid. I asked you to turn off your phones and I left mine on. Just a moment. Real quick. It's guys like Fraga who thugs need when they start shit. Right now? And the shit that Beirada started changed Fraga's story... and Rio's story... and my story. The punks set fire to Qual?. He's on fire, but everyone's in the main hall already. - Can you hear me? - Affirmative. From here, I think it's one long and two short. I think it's a twelve-gauge and two pistols. The guards are tied to the bars, close to you there. They want to break thru. What door is that? - Third Command. - Zoom in on that door. The guys want to enter the wing of the Third. They want to kill everyone there too. They want in, we'll let 'em in. We'll let them in. Andr?, get the squad in position... but do nothing until I give the order, understood? We're gonna let these guys go in there. - Understood? Do you copy? - Affirmative, Colonel. Zero One, in position. - Show me the squad. - Monitor 4, Colonel. Confirm... Andr?, confirm it's a twelve-gauge in that punk's hand. Where's the Third? I wanna go into the fucking Third. Affirmative, Colonel. Do you copy? Copy. Commander, we have a good opportunity here. Nascimento, one minute... I need authorization from the Governor. Just a minute. Pardon me. The Red Commandoes killed the heads of ADA. Nascimento wants authorization to enter and finish the job. Could be a good idea, Governor. It solves the problem completely. The public will support it. Nobody tolerates these assholes anymore. No. I don't want another "Carandiru". - Where's the guy from human rights? - I already sent him. He should be there soon. Tell Nascimento to buy some time. Does the Governor realize the opportunity... we have right here, Commander? - And you'll let this guy go in? - The man's here, Colonel. He's already here. Open this shit now. I want the fucking Third, man! Sup, bro? Wassup? Nascimento, let's deal with this problem and... - not make it personal. Cool? - Cool, Fraga. Unfortunately I cannot authorize your entry. If I don't go in, there'll be a bloodbath. - It's already started. - I know. - It's already started. - I know, I know. I don't want to pull your body from there. Colonel, you have to understand... my entry's already been authorized by your boss. I'm going in. Fraga! - The vest, Renan. - No need. - No need. I won't use it. - Wear the vest, Fraga. If I go in with a vest, Colonel... they won't trust me. Andr?, Che Guevara here is going in without a vest. Beirada, what the hell is this? What's going on here? This fuck isn't coming close? He's right in front of you, Andr?. Can you hear me? With all due respect... - Affirmative. - With all due respect... we're solving our own problem, understand? Solving your problem? This way?! Beirada has a pistol in his hand. We gotta do what we gotta do, you feel me, Fraga? - Let me tell you something... - With all due respect. BOPE is outside and is coming to kill everyone. Fuck 'em! We'll kill all these fuckers here. They're not even here for these people. Think! BOPE doesn't give a shit about these guys. They haven't come in yet because I'm fucking here. He's doing well. Hold, stay calm. If I leave, you're fucked. Release these guys. - You guarantee? - I guarantee. Let them go. - You guarantee, Fraga? - Do it, Beirada. - Man to man. - I'll stay. Let them go. Think, damn it. Let these guys go so I can come in and talk with you. Do it. Do it. Let them go. - Let these guys go, Beirada. - You guarantee, Fraga? If I leave, you're fucked. Let's end this as quickly as possible. Let them go and let's get this over with. Enough damn killings. Let's end this. - Do it. Let them go. - Paulinho, let these guys go. - Let them go. - Ok. Let them fucking go. He's untying the hostages, Andr?. He's untied one. The man's in control of the situation, Andr?. Hold. Stay put. He opened the door. Ok? He opened the door, he's letting them go. One's out, two's out, Fraga went in. Easy, he's in charge, Andr?. Stop, Andr?! Stop, Andr?! Fuck. Don't shoot, damn it! Don't shoot! - He's gonna die, son. - Lower your gun, Beirada. Lower my gun, fuck that. Lower your gun, he won't shoot. - He will, bro. - Do you hear, Captain? - Let the hostage go. - He won't shoot anymore. It's over. No one will shoot anymore, do you hear, Captain? - Lower your gun, Beirada. - Lower my gun, my ass. - Shit. - No more shooting, Captain! Lower your gun. Lower your gun coz it's over. It's over, Beirada. - Listen, Beirada, it's over. - Let him go. - You can trust me. - It's a trick, son. Trust me, Beirada. It's over. Lower the damn gun. Lower your gun, trust me. Lower it. Matias seized his chance. He did as trained in BOPE. He killed the punk to protect the hostage. The problem, my friend, is that a .762 bullet makes... a small entry hole... but the exit hole is the size of a tangerine. The team entered and in less than a minute... we had the problem resolved. Matias eliminated the toughest guy... - in the history of Red Commandoes. - Hands on your head! There was just one detail that spoiled everything. That fucking T-shirt. "Human Rights" written in English and covered in blood... That shit turned into headlines the world over. A massacre, total carnage, that's what happened inside. The Governor will have to explain how, after he promised me... that there would be no massacre, immediately after... Colonel Nascimento and Captain Matias... executed the prisoners in cold blood. Because it was an execution. It was an execution. Give us more details. Was there a negotiation? No. No time for negotiation. The bullets from Captain Matias, on orders from Colonel Nascimento... got there first. BOPE entered only and exclusively to kill and they killed. In fact, they did what they're used to doing in the slums of Rio. Ethnic cleansing. Social cleansing. That's what they do. And that's what they're paid for. To be cowards. BOPE today were cowards in that prison... just as they are cowards in our community. I'd like, just one time, to see BOPE invade and arrest a drug dealer... in a luxury condo. But it's not what they do, right, Mr. Secretary of Public Security? There, the Skulls don't go in, do they, Mr. Chief of Police? So you think that BOPE acted with excessive force? Is this what doomed the operation? What we can't admit is that a representative of the State... is more violent than those that we want... in prison for violent crimes. It's absurd. This is becoming routine. This is becoming normal. And no one thinks it's odd? To have a police force whose symbol is a skull? To have a police force whose symbol is death? I find this inexplicable. Mr. Governor. I'm perplexed. Sir, you will have to give an explanation. And it won't do to say that Colonel Nascimento... ignored your orders. Yes, Colonel Nascimento was a coward. Yes, he led the entire massacre. But the one who orders the police is the Governor. It's all his responsibility. Fuck, I did everything to save Fraga and the guy bashed me. I never butted into Rosane's life after we separated. But marrying him was a low blow. The guy went around filling my son's head with bullshit. It's best you don't come in. Did you read the paper today? So why isn't Formoso here talking to me now? Why can't I talk to Formoso? So when... So when he comes to talk to us... we'll speak to the press, Pinheiro. Cheers. Commander, the decision to go in was mine. I'm the one who killed. Let me take responsibility alone. The responsibility is mine, Andr?. The responsibility is mine. I'm in command. Colonel, you'll excuse me... but if we're gonna go down, better to go down shooting. Our unit is being thrown to the dogs. Let's call the press and let the shit hit the fan. Let's fuck these bastards, sir. Andr?, you heard what I said? You heard my conversation with Pinheiro just now? - Were you listening? You heard? - Yes, sir. So you want to fight with the Governor? Now? In the press? You want to fuck the Battalion over? You don't want this. Lupe, did you find the Commander-General? No, he went to lunch. Then find out where and let me know. These guys are afraid to talk to me. I'm not afraid to talk to them. After the accusations from the representative... of Human Rights AID that reverberated around world... Guanabara Palace said that they will relieve from duty... the BOPE officers involved in the occupation of the Bangu One prison. True. But if not Otavio... who will you put, Guaracy? Who it'll be, or who it won't be, matters little. The Governor wants that son a bitch Nascimento discharged tomorrow. - Ok. - End of story. Let's resolve this quickly. We'll quickly put, promote the subcommander? - Renan? - Quickly. - Good idea. - Yeah. Renan. Later we'll see who to put in his place and done. True. Oh shit. Don't look now... but that asshole is coming in right now. - Who? - Fucking Nascimento. Look. The Governor needed a scapegoat. He put Beirada's death on me. But for the public, my friend, a good thug is a dead thug. Well done. Go talk to him. Go hug him. Go talk to him. Go talk to him. Colonel! Welcome. What a pleasant surprise. Welcome. Now I'd like to ask for a little of your attention... gentlemen, and your attention ladies. Queixada, close in. Open up, Imperador. Governor of this wonderful state... of Rio de Janeiro, pay attention. Do you know what this is, Governor? Big steps. It's what's happening to our city... which is taking big steps toward barbarism. Governor, do not discharge Colonel Nascimento of duty. Because if you do, it'll stink. Stink with a capital S. Because you would be giving the green light... for them to return to the streets, prowl the bars... the plazas, the schools, offering drugs to our sons... to our daughters. Governor, you would be turning our city... into an enormous pool of blood. Is this what you want? To transform our city... into an enormous pool of blood? No! Don't do that. Do this right now. Close in, Queixada. Close in, Imperador. "Dagger in the Skull"... and strike these thugs. Release the steel. Finger on the trigger. The man's show has a a rating of almost 30 points. They get tons of letters from the audience. - The tide will turn, Governor. - Now I'm a fan... I know what I'm doing. - of Colonel Nascimento... - Nascimento is out of BOPE. my wife is a fan, even my dog Diana... is a fan of Colonel Nascimento. Don't transform our city into a pool of blood. Combat trafficking now. And that's how Fraga toppled me from the command of BOPE. Only, I didn't fall down, my friend. - I fell up. - Good morning, Mr. Subsecretary. I'm Valmir Magalh?es, coordinator here of SSI. The Secretary asked me to welcome you. Please. If voters were saying that I was a hero... who was the Governor to say otherwise? Renata, please send me the report. If you'll be so kind... in a while, we'll need to record your fingerprints. The first day I was almost lost. - Hell, I never had a computer before. - The room. How could I be Subsecretary of Intelligence? How could I be responsible... for all the wiretaps of Rio de Janeiro? - This is all wiretapping? - That's Monitoring. You can see we have cameras there... we have access to all the cameras in the city. This is the Watchdog, where we log... all phone interceptions. It would be difficult... but I had landed where no Skull had ever been. In the Secretariat of Security, I wouldn't be fighting only drugs. I'd be able to fight the system. Commander, this Skull will fuck up our scheme... in our unit, goddamn it. Put him in an operation, let him take a shot... friendly fire and done... - bury him with military honors. - Captain. You have been very well commended in this battalion... but I'm in command, goddamn it. You're gonna fuck up our scheme. - Fuck our scheme. - This is fucked. - This is fucked. - What, M?rio? What the fuck is "this"? I'm telling you. We can't lay a finger on a Skull, goddamn it. It's an order. He's my friend. He saved my life one time. I'll put him in a corner out of the way. Forget this fucking shit. Fuck up my battalion here. Tell the Captain to enter. Then it's on you, ok, Commander. It seemed all was going to end well. But things were beginning to crumble. The Governor, who wasn't an idiot at all... decided to please the left. Someone had to pay for the blood on the shirt of human rights. Permission to present myself, Colonel. What a pleasure, trainee. The mere thought of Matias wearing that blue uniform... gave me hives. Mr. Secretary, I'd like if you could intercede... with the Governor in relation to the situation... of Captain Andr? Matias. It's not fair for him to be in that unit. Matias is one of the best cops we have. It's not right for him to be there, it's not correct, it's not fair. I was in command of the operation at Bangu, Mr. Secretary. I'd like you to take this... as a personal request from me. Well, Colonel, I think your position is commendable. I think your request is fair. I will speak to the Governor, touch on this subject. I'm sure he will understand. Matias, I knew that Nascimento was an asshole, partner. He thinks he's got the biggest cock. But betrayal, I didn't expect that. That's bullshit. The guy there in the government and you expelled from BOPE? - Son of a bitch. - F?bio, don't meddle in this shit... - It's not your business. - What's wrong? - Don't meddle. - Relax, Matias. Stay out of this. I'll make you relax. I'll put you where you can relax. Trust me! You're going to relax big time, partner. - This is where you'll be. - Fucking hell, F?bio. Central Archives. It's important! Organize this shit for me, ok? I tried to help Matias, but he couldn't stand the humiliation. He called Clara Vidal, the most controversial journalist in the city... May I record what you're saying? You may. I'll repeat. ...and let the shit hit the fan. It's cowardly for the Governor... to blame me for the prison deaths. BOPE has been abandoned for long time. Cops go into the streets to kill thugs every day. I can't accept this cowardice. Especially from a government that only thinks about politics... and only thinks of themselves. The Governor was furious and Matias was completely fucked. On top of being in a unit of corrupt cops... he got 30 days in jail. May I come in? How can I get you out of here, Andr?? "BOPE Officer Blames Governor" What are you trying to accomplish by stirring shit up? - I don't get it. - Stirring shit, Colonel? You mean, telling the truth, defending the Battalion... is stirring shit up? Watch your tone with me. - I was telling the truth. - Show respect! Watch your tone with me. Don't talk to me about defending the Battalion. You defend the Battalion doing what I taught you. Not giving interviews to papers. You're in jail, Andr?. You'll defend what from here? You're in jail, old friend. If there's anyone here... here in this room who can defend the Battalion... excuse me, but it's not you. I can defend the Battalion from the SSI. - I can do... - Colonel... for the unit what no one has ever done for the unit. - Colonel... - I can. Colonel, with all due respect, these sons of bitches that you're mingling with... only care about politics. The only thing that'll change with you inside the Secretariat... is yourself. Unless you've already changed, huh? - Good evening. How are you? - Good evening. To make things worse, Fraga turned his 15 minutes of fame... into a candidacy for state representative. ...campaign proposals... what I'd like you... Of course, all the intellectuals on the left... and all the potheads would vote for him. Hi, how are you? Some proposals from my campaign. I don't want you stuck in front of him. I want you circling. Circling. Don't stop in front of him. This armchair Che Guevara already pissed me off... as NGO head, imagine what he'd do... if he held public office. It would be fucked up. And my family would be caught in the crossfire. Grab the kimono with both hands, Rafa! The kimono with both hands, Rafa! I won't deny it, I like fighting. For me, only those who can fight can live in peace. I only wanted to teach this to my son... without worrying about the opinion of others. Come on, Rafa. Come on, come on! Sit up! Good, good, good. Good, Rafa. Good, Rafa. Good. Good. Watch the sweep, the sweep. All good. All good. You know the only thing I didn't like? Your hand loose. You have to grab here... Both hands on the kimono, No hand loose. - I didn't want to fight. - Didn't want to fight? You pestered me all month long to come fight. Why didn't you want to fight, son? We're here, let's fight to win now. We won't lose. Fight to win. I'm not like you, beating people up. How are you? Have you calmed down? Beto, the problem isn't what Rafa does or doesn't hear. It's what you do. The man tells my son I'm a murderer... - and the problem is what I do? - He didn't. He spoke on TV and Rafa heard. Ah, right. On TV, he can? On TV, it's ok? Did he lie? I'm a cop, Rosane. I'm not, I'm not... A coffee. I'm not gonna argue this with you. A coffee, please. I'm not gonna argue with you either... the definition of murderer. I just won't hide the truth from my son. If you don't want to lose Rafa... - That's what you think? - speak to... That's what you think I am, now? Doesn't matter what I think. If you want to be close with Rafa... you'll have to tell him the truth. I won't lie to my son. You'll have to find a way to explain to him... what you do for a living, Beto. Battalion. Attention! Battalion. At ease! My son was afraid of me... ...Rosane considered me a fascist... ...Matias considered me a traitor. I should have been depressed, my friend. But I wasn't. My mission was more important... than my personal problems. Gentlemen, BOPE is a fundamental part... of our mandate of public security. I have total confidence in your abilities. - Together always. - Skulls! I dove into my work, my friend. I exorcized my demons... in Rio's Secretariat of Public Security Skulls! Go and defeat. Know no defeat. - Special Ops! - Bravo, well done. Bravo! I did what I told Matias I'd do. I turned BOPE into a war machine. With me in the Secretariat of Security... BOPE got up to 390 officers... and 16 tactical teams. Before, we had 8 cars. Now, we had armored cars and a helicopter. For some, war is cure. War acts as an escape valve. When pressure mounts at home, vent it on the streets. With me, it was always like that. There! Hit there. Pinheiro, can you hear me? Concentrate fire at the top, they're gonna come down. Look there. Keep it there. Let's go! Let's go! You can go in, Pinheiro. Send everyone up. Do you copy, Pinheiro? After I arrived at the Secretariat of Security... the thugs no longer had peace. The war machine I helped set up... busted trafficking in Rio. It was only a matter of time. With trafficking out of the game, the corruption spree would end. Finally, I would fuck up the system. In theory, my plan had everything to succeed. The less pot and cocaine consumed... the less return from trafficking. Hey, Marcinho, what you got for us, son? Hey listen. We ain't got nothing for you. Ah, don't give me that, Marcinho. I came here, bro, you gotta lay some eggs. ...your buddies killed... If the dealers broke, the dirty cops would break too. Sup, buddy? We're choking, can't sell nothing, Rocha. Marcinho. Come on, buddy, let go the loot, son. Listen, we only got 500 bones from cable TV. You make me come up here for 500 fucking bones? - Beat it, son. - Shut up, pothead. - Go fuck yourself. - Go fuck yourself, bro. Come on, Rocha. Give my hood a break, man. Don't sweat. When the scratch is light, my friend, the love is gone. Let's go, Santos. Check it out, Gon?alves. Yay, there's already 20 here. Check the wallet, check his backpack too. Take the watch. Good. Leave them there. Without their cut from drugs, the crooks wouldn't get along anymore. Damn, took Marcinho out? You want to fuck me. 30 per week? What is that? Wanna fuck the unit over? Wanna fuck me out of my command? Colonel, every dog licks his own dick. And another thing... Who said you're in command? - Commander, your subordinate... - F?bio! ...challenging me, disrespecting me... - ordering around... - Easy, F?bio. I'll hold him 30 days, then run him over. Captain Rocha is key to the administration. But he's demoralizing me. I have to satisfy a lot of interests, F?bio. I'm in command, Formoso! Colonel, what do you want? You want another post? You want to switch unit? I'll switch you. But you'll be fucked, ok. A suggestion. You won the lottery, F?bio. Don't throw it away. With all due respect, listen to me. Dismissed, Colonel F?bio. And I was gonna kill two birds with one stone. Son of a bitch. That would have been the first step in the clean-up... of the Military Police of Rio. Except, in practice, everything went wrong. The guys are coming up there. These guys, fuck. What, faggot? Don't start with that. What actually happened was not what I had planned What you got for us, son? Here's the deal, bro. I only have 500 Reals to give you, Rocha. Where's this dough coming from if you can't sell? - You're selling your ass now? - Fuck that! That shit's from cable TV, Rocha. That shit ain't from drugs, bro. From cable TV? Talk to me! This shit here, each resident's gotta give us 12 Reals. Got it? That's nothing. Just so that each resident can have a TV at home. Yep, nothing like an economic crisis to trigger innovation. It only took the loss of drug bribes for the crooked cops... to see the obvious. Each poor neighborhood in Rio... is much more than a place to sell drugs. Come on, Rocha. Give my hood a break, man. Don't sweat. Who said this is your hood? Rocha realized, by eliminating the middleman... the system grossed more. It was obvious. It was simple math. Hey, Irineu? Selling many subscriptions? Hey, boss. Soon, there won't be enough poles! No. We'll arrange poles. Just continue. Slum folks like cable TV. Hey, Valdir. Slum folks drink water. Slum folks get online. People connecting? ...Damn! Everyone's plugged in! Here, Santos. Slum folks cook with gas. Pops, I'm confiscating this. I'm gonna leave it there. You'll go down the slope, take the first left. Go to Danilo Baiano, there you'll buy gas. Hurry, it's closing. - Slum folks take out loans. - Go, pops! We're not like just any bankers, Mrs. Severina. We're fair. But here, you have to pay. - I know. - You have to pay. Aranha, I'm outta here, ok. I zeroed the register. - No worries. - Ready? I just need your name... Every slum is a huge market... of purchases and sales. Rocha figured out it was better to tax the whole slum... than a bunch of fucked-up drug dealers. Each time money changed hands, Rocha took a tax. The crooks' own Robin Hood tax. Motherfuckers robbin' the hood. Pretext? To defend the hood from trafficking. The truth was quite different. This fucking van doesn't make much, dude. Barely enough for one, man. How can I split with you, Rocha? You won't split? I'll give you a break. It's 90% for us and 10% for you, ok? What? Are you crazy, dude? I have a family to feed. 10% ain't enough for anyone! Marreco, take over this shit. Beat this bitch, Marreco, fuck him up! - Bring him here. - Fuck him up! Leave him to me. You don't wanna pay the tax, huh, bitch?! Good. My turn. - Let's take a walk! - Let's take a walk, yeah. Yeah! Santos, Santos. Shake him well to jiggle his head. You gotta pay the tax, kid. Fuck him up. Whereas F?bio pulled in 30,000 every month... Rocha pulled in 300,000, tax-free. In 4 years, the system took over almost all... the West Side of Rio. In the past, we invaded and the dealers came back. But when the dirty cops started occupying the slums... the dealers didn't come back. For a while, I thought the system was helping BOPE. But really, it was BOPE helping the system. Yeah, I helped create the monster that was going to devour me. (Present time) What's worse is that only one person realized this... Representative Diogo Fraga. You know what I found about homicides... in the areas of the militia? Many witnesses started dying. It was Rocha's gang. They killed my brother. More than 20 shots, in front of everyone. And before dying, these same witnesses gave new statements. - Then who was it? - Who it was, I don't know, ma'am. I know who didn't do it. It wasn't Rocha. You can put that down. It wasn't Rocha. Wherever there's militia, there's profit and death... fostered by public agents in charge of security. In practice, the militia is the mafia. You pay them to protect you from them. With the growth of militias... Fraga found another cause... in the name of human rights. And like all good politicians, he exploited it to the fullest. Because, on top of the violence that you can see here... they talk as if they're legitimate. Of protection, of self-defense against trafficking... but, in reality, they want control. Damn! That's a lot of bullets, huh, Fraga. Yeah. What we're dealing with is the mafia, Mr. President. Because that's what it is. The militia is the mafia. True organized crime. Permission to speak, Representative, President. You may speak, Representative. Fraga, for the love of God. You're talking about the mafia, son? Nonsense. The mafia are Italians who love pasta, rondelli, gnocchi. - Rep. Fortunato, I... - We love rice and beans. I'm a huge fan of your sense of humor, you know that. But I think it fits better on your show. In Italy there's no trafficking, you know that. - No trafficking?! - This is hood self-protection. Yes, but folks are dying in these hoods. - Hood self-protection. - Self-protection? That's what you call it? Pay them to protect from them. - Go there, see if... - I go there! You have any idea how many people... die in these neighborhoods? - They're protecting themselves. - Any idea? - Decorum! Decorum, please! - Forgive me, Mr. President. Listen. Let me tell you something, Fraga. We're in an election year. Everyone's in campaign mode. - You have your own campaign. - Election year? It's like any other year for me. - What! Don't say that. - You know very well that... a CPI inquiry in an election year... - turns into campaigning. - No, Mr. President... I just think that this matter is more important... than whatever election year. That's my position. Look, Fraga, I'm not saying you're wrong... nor that he's right. What I'm saying is this: in an election year... I will not accept your CPI. Clear your head, think about something else... Fraga's strategy was to fight the government head-on. He loved provoking us to see what came out in the media. Fraga wanted to be a federal representative... and a CPI would be his ticket to the capital, Brasilia. But 4 years later, everyone still believed... that my plan had worked. Guaracy was cashing in from my blows on trafficking. Good morning, Mr. Governor. Good morning. It was so successful... that he ditched the Secretariat of Security... and left to be a federal congressman. - How are you? Good? - I already went ahead. The Governor in the center, please. Vermont, I'm not convinced about this tie. Yellow? - It's great! - Gold. - Yellow's nice, Governor. - It's nice. Even the Governor was reaping the fruits of my labor. His reelection was guaranteed. The problem was, the more votes Guaracy won... the more Fraga criticized me. And the more he criticized me... the more my son distanced himself from me. Rafael, if you want a ride, I'm leaving. Ok. This is for Fraga. - Fraga. - Thanks, kid. Julia is leaving now. Can I go with her? - Of course. You can go. - Thanks. Thanks for today. Ready to go? Let's go. Yeah, my friend, just when things couldn't get worse. After Fraga became state representative... I couldn't even look him in the face. Here it is, Representative. She just needs to sign this document... appear in court and that's all. Understood. Here, Julia. Read carefully, don't rush, then sign. - Barata, how's it going? - Colonel, how are you? - Good. - What happened here? - Nothing, it's all resolved. - Can I see the statement? - Of course. - Beto...? I was going to tell you. Can I read? He's my son. Rafa had nothing to do with this. Can we remain civil? Tell him not to talk to me. Calm down, calm down. 100 grams, Barata? You were buying for the entire office, miss? A moral lecture, now? Barata, look, my son is 16. Nowadays, that's corruption of minors. And 100 grams, nowadays, that's drug trafficking. Beto, stop it. I said, don't talk to me. - Folks, please. - I told you... to shut your mouth and not speak to me. - Shut your mouth! - Dad! The pot was mine. You can put that down, sir, the pot was mine. His father is right. 100 grams of pot is no joke. Hey, you shouldn't have taken the blame. Yeah? And let her get arrested? Because of your argument? That has nothing to do with it, Rafael. By the way, you have to fire her. Why would I fire her? For exposing Rafa. She took responsibility, didn't she? Rafa is right. If there's a problem here... it's not her. Ok, if you don't... Rafa won't work there anymore. That's what he wants. Exactly what he wants. He wants us to fight, to push Rafa rom me. That's exactly it. You think this was normal? No, not normal, Rosane. Just like it wasn't normal how he acted. He was deciding the kid's life. He didn't decide. He arrived at the station... and his son was there with 100 grams of pot. Right in front of us. He wants what's best for his son. At no time did he ask us... I'm tired. I lost my appetite. You're acting just like my father. Of course, I didn't want to hear what Fraga... was saying about the militias. It was hard separating things. That's why I couldn't see what was happening... in Rio. The system was changing, evolving. Before, politicians used the system to make money. Now they depended on the system to get elected. You understand? The sports center is already open... the kids are playing sports. The renovation of the public square... is on its way, trash collection... You know you have our support. The Governor is here so I can't lie. You can be sure that one of our priorities... - is the support of the community. - Governor, speechless. Sincerely. Just a moment. Just a moment. Just a moment, godfather. Paquito, take a picture, Paquito, damn it. You're too slow. Relax, folks, today it's in celebration. It's in celebration. I'd like to thank you all in the community for being here. We're very happy for you. But I coudn't begin this without honoring.. 3 people very important to us. First, the honorable Governor Gelino... up for reelection. Thank you, Governor. You will be reelected here by the community. You can count on that. Thank you, Governor. I'd also like to note the presence of... the Secretary of Public Security in Rio, Guaracy. Thank you, Guaracy. Guaracy who is now a fed. Thanks to us as well. And our eternal godfather, Representative Fortunato. Thank you, Representative. - I'm your fan. - We're with you. - Thank you, thank you. - We're with you. A blessing. Today is a celebration of 4 years... of our Community Center of Rio das Rochas! It's all ours! Let's do some samba now and tear this shit up. Waddup. Yeah, baby. Beautiful. Oh, lovely. "A new leader is born in the hills of the flagpole." Remember what I told you before? In the slums, cash flows, deals are closed... and the system levies a tax? Well, yeah, but I skipped one thing, my friend. In Brazil, elections are business... and votes are the most valuable commodity in the slums. Didn't take long for Guaracy, Fortunato, and Gelino... to realize the militia expanded the Governor's constituency. The more slums the militia controlled, the more votes they got. Hey, F?bio? You like the boat? Fuck, you gotta appreciate me more, Rocha. - I'm at the front lines. - Shit, you got balls. You're already bitching? Hey, Santos. - Why you bitching? - Shit, F?bio, listen... I didn't bring you here for this. Here's the deal. We're taking the whole West Side, Tanque will be ours. You're gonna help me. Fuck, bro, that's gonna be a bitch. There's more guns there than in my unit. - Just a moment. - F?bio, take it easy, man. Something's happening right now that'll change our lives. (Police Station, Tanque area) Go, go! Come on! - Don't fuck with me! - Why you looking at me? - On the ground. - Let's go. - Come on! - Come on, goddamn it. - Game over. - I'm gonna fuck you up! - Face the wall. - Wait! Easy, easy! Don't fuck around, so no one gets hurt, all right? - Are you the Chief? - Yes, sir. The key for the reserve arsenal! - Take it easy. - The fucking key quickly! Face on the fucking floor. Here, the rifles are here. Hello. Yeah, Sem Alma. Good, son, good. Scratch them but don't bury them, ok. Don't bury them, we'll need them. Thanks. Speak, F?bio. What's your question? - Something I don't understand. - Speak, damn it. We wanted the Skull out of the way. We did, but not anymore. - Why not? - To take Tanque... who am I gonna entrust? The crooks in your battalion? Are you fucking kidding me? He's such a joker, isn't he? Romance your woman, F?bio. - Shit, relax. - Shit, I'm annoyed. Militiamen are primitive but not stupid. You love me. Tanque was the last stronghold of trafficking on the West Side. Let's go, Mariguela. Ready? Lots of money there and lots of votes. But lots of guns too. Let's record, ok. Roll VT. Rolling, 4, 3... The militia could never take Tanque alone. What's happening to our city Rio de Janeiro? What's happening to our wonderful city? Thugs come into a police station and steal weapons. Weapons from inside a police station! This isn't crime, no sir. This is terrorism! Don't talk to me about human rights... because terrorists, to me, aren't people. It's because of "blah, blah, blah, human rights". Can't touch the thugs Don't touch the thugs. Don't touch the thugs. Give candy to the thugs. Send roses to the thugs. This is a circus, man. Here, close in on me, Imperador. Governor... you know what this is? This is a little dance. This is what will happen to your administration. Your administration will dance if you don't respond... because these thugs will take these guns... to take on your government. We can't let that happen. What is this, people? What is this? They want to fight the administration... that best cleaned up this city... of narcotics trafficking. Governor... Destroy them! Secretary, I have to admit that this asshole can speak. I agree, Governor... - I'm talking to Guaracy. - He's right. If we play weak now, we'll lose votes. We have to strike... to guarantee these elections. Listen, bystanders could end up dead... - with this kind of operation. - Excuse me. Governor, the campaign materials are in. I decide these things, Formoso. Sure. Let's go see the campaign materials. - Goddamn, I don't believe it. - You like it? - Vermont... - It's very good. - Very good. - You've outdone yourself. - Great, isn't it? - Don't you think? It looks like shit. Look at this gold tie. I told you it wouldn't work. It won't connect with the public. It's not popular. Look at Fortunato's tooth, that broken tooth. This speaks to the people, you understand? All the campaign material must be redone, ok? - Redo it? - Do it. Governor, we already owe a ton of suppliers. You owe? Pay with this. You can't vote for an administration that can't even protect a station. Either the Governor would respond or the press would eat him alive. How many? You remember? And that's what the militia was betting on. ...or 8. 7 or 8. And they assaulted you? They came in here, beat everyone. They cleaned everything out. Could you identify any dealer from the area? Turn that off. It's off. What I'm about to tell you, you didn't hear from me, ok? They weren't dealers at all. They came in with combat boots... Show us where the reserve arsenal is. They referred to the "reserve arsenal". That's not the vocabulary of dealers. Cops? So it was the militia. He said that? That it was the militia? No, he didn't say that. Because he was afraid to say anything. But think about it, the guy's Chief of Police... he heard them speak. He understands, right? The language. Sure. Of course. Yeah, it's possible. It's very possible, in fact. You know what I think about the militia? I know. That's why I came straight here. - Rafa! Do me a favor? - Yeah? Bring a complete copy of the file on the militias... to give to Clara, please. - Ok. - Thanks. - You're giving me the militia file? - This is very serious, Clara. - I know. - What we're talking about... is the worst problem in Rio. It's the mafia. Thanks, Rafa. I have no doubt that the militia is involved. You have no idea what the militia is capable of. Look, this is the file with the main clues on all... we've been talking about. If you help me expose this... I'll serve the CPI. Take it, read it with care. I'll read it and speak to my editor, all right? - Excuse me, Colonel. - Close the door. Yes, sir? The Governor wants to take Tanque. - I know. - A massive operation. He thinks the weapons are there. - Are you getting feeds from there? - Yes, I am. So mobilize everyone, I want to hear everything, ok? - Got it. - We have little time. That's right. The militia was so sure... that the government would rid Tanque of the dealers... that they were already recruiting people to keep them out. And to scare dealers, my friend... nothing better than the Skulls. Ah, he's here. Sup, F?bio. Hey, buddy. Sup, Rocha. Sup, Matias. How you doing, man? A beer, please. Good? - Cool, mate? - What do you want with me? What I want is simplicity. Look at the neighborhood, partner. Just look. A mother can walk with her son peacefully. The vans are working. Look at the MP there. No one has to hide their wallet to go to work anymore. It's not like before. It was a fucking mess, partner. And there's no more theft. The slum is damn good to live in. - What's that got to do with me? - Shit, Matias. I learned that the police will do a massive operation in Tanque. If the MP invades, it'll be easy for us to occupy it. And I don't know anyone better than you to... - manage this here. - Me? Fucking Skulls, man. Someone the thugs fear. Aren't you a Skull? You'll understand what I'm saying. Godfather, can you hear me? - Talk to me. - Godfather, listen. What can we do to return a friend to BOPE? - Help him out. - Is he solid? Can I trust him? More than solid, godfather. 100%. The best Skull we got. He's going to help us with the project. Get his ID and tell him to show up Monday. So, Matias? You going back to BOPE or what? Hey, boss... No one got that shit and they're already calling... No one wants to show these guns. Poke Moleira coz this shit's about to get hot. I already talked to Moleira, he thought it was you too. He said to stay alert coz the cops are pissed. I joined this meeting to say that the taps... proved that the dealers didn't know shit... - about stolen arms. - Secretary. - Good afternoon. - I know what to do. - Sorry I'm late. - Nascimento. But when I came in, I couldn't utter a word. I was reviewing the intel. Secretary, our opinion remains the same... there is no reason to justify an invasion. Subsecretary, the Governor gave the order to invade. And we have reliable info from Colonel F?bio's informant... - Right, Colonel? - Affirmative. That the arms are there. Plus I think the dealers... are deceiving you on the phone. Secretary, excuse me, with all due respect... but I have 300 hours of phone recordings here. That's 300 hours of recording against the word of one informant... that only Colonel F?bio knows. Secretary, with all due respect, my informant is reliable. Colonel, can you tell us the name of your informant? - Nascimento! - My informant is reliable. Can you tell us... - who your informant is. - Nascimento! This operation is wrong, Formoso. The arms aren't there. This operation is wrong. Secretary, if the intel is correct... then there's no reason to invade. Let me consult with the Governor, just a minute. Telephone for Dr. Guaracy. Come in. - Telefone, sir. - Thank you. Hello? Formoso, I won't speak to the Governor. He's for invasion. Invade that shit and pronto. Right. The Governor ordered us to proceed. We're invading. Excuse me. Excuse me. Valmir, take this to the car for me. Can I speak to you for a minute? - What, sir? - I want to know... how you got back into BOPE. If you don't know... then, clearly, it wasn't you who helped me, sir. Permission to leave? Permission granted, Andr?. The cops in Tanque were so corrupt that not even I... could get rid of the thugs there. To take Tanque, only a massive operation would do. Check out those guys. But the Governor didn't want that. In an election year, there could be no dead bystanders. And that's when Matias had a genius idea... but dangerous as hell. He entered Tanque in broad daylight and rolled in slowly... right in front of the thugs. Zero One, check that guy, there. Hey, what's up. There were guns everywhere. If anyone suspected a thing, Matias was fucked. But Matias was disguised as a dirty cop... and the thugs thought they were among friends. - All good, partner? - All good. You can go. Ok, thanks. Good job, guys. Quiet? Boc?o, Moraes, do the rounds below for me? Going. The team spent the night in the outpost... at a strategic point in the slum waiting for daybreak. Waiting for us to invade. Shoot them! Go, go, go! Go, go, goddamn it! Whenever we tried to invade Tanque... Felpa's gang escaped the same way. The MPs would land... the thugs would jet. Go! Hurry the fuck up! The armored car followed as far as possible. When the convoy hit Felpa's alleys, he resisted. He held everyone up until his posse spilled toward the outpost. The MPs there wouldn't even see the punks pass. It was a game with marked cards. But that day, my friend... it wasn't the paid-off MPs that were at the outpost. It was the Skulls. - Going for it, Zero One. - Wait. - Going for it. - Wait. Fire! Die, you fucks! - Go, go! - Die. Go, let's go. Let's go! Attention, Boc?o! Let's check the weapons. One by one the dealers of Tanque would die. The whole West Side would be in the hands of Rocha... and join the constituency of the administration. Zero One, I think that's all. Call the Colonel? - Call him. - Show the weapons, Boc?o! Ask him to show the weapons, Valmir. Hey, Zero One, show them. - Hey, Azevedo? - Those aren't the arms. Those aren't from the station. - Are you recording this, Valmir? - Yes, sir. You know what this operation should be called? - No, sir. - Operation Iraq. The strategy of the system was well thought-out. The drug lord of Tanque could even escape... but he'd never have the courage to return. Check the punk there. The punk! Felpa. It's Felpa. Let BOPE take him out, F?bio. - Tatu?! Boc?o! - What? - There! - Where'd he go, Zero One? - There, in the alley. - There. Didn't I tell you BOPE would go get him. There. Move! Fucking move! Give up! I give up. I give up, fuck! Just one problem. Rocha called for Matias to work with him. - I surrender. - Tie him up, Boc?o. And I'm the one who trained Matias, my friend. He wouldn't stop until he had found those arms. - It wouldn't be pretty. - You're the boss? I am. So here's what you'll do... you'll tell me now where the police weapons are. What police weapons? Dunno shit about no weapons, man. - You don't, huh? - Dunno shit about no weapons. - Where are the guns? - Dunno about guns. - I'm telling you! - Where are the guns? What guns? I dunno! Let's work it out... - I dunno about no guns! - Listen, punk. This ain't a negotiation. I want to know where the fuck those guns are! - I dunno about no fucking guns! - Talk! - I dunno - Talk, you fuck. - Fucking talk. - I don't fucking know. I don't fucking know! Let's work him over, Zero One. Put him in the bag. Fuck, this is taking forever. Let's check this shit out. Come on, Nunes. Marreco, come. - Check it out? - Take over, Gon?alves. Let's go. He's fucked up, Zero One. He doesn't know anything. Look at me, cocksucker. You're gonna tell me... where the police weapons are right now, got it? - I don't got 'em. - You don't got 'em, huh? You got 'em. Tell me now where they are! Talk, motherfucker. I don't got 'em. I don't... - Don't want to cooperate? - I already told you... - Don't want to cooperate? - I don't got 'em... Put him in the bag again, Boc?o. What the fuck, Rocha? Are you fucking nuts? He was the boss! He was gonna give me the arms! Well done. Excellent work by BOPE, Captain. That's who we were after. Right, Commander? - What's going on, F?bio? - Sad for the thug, Matias? Boc?o! Tatu?! Take the boss down... so I can have a litle chat with F?bio. What the fuck, Colonel? What's going on? I smell bullshit. - Who's the informant? - I'll find out and let you know. Who's X9? Here's what you'll do, you'll call me... later, you'll give me the name and number of X9. And I want this today! Understood, Major? Stop! What the fuck, Russo? What the fuck, Marreco? What the fuck? You fucking killed him! Fuck, didn't you want him out of the way? He's out of the way. What you want? You're gonna light a candle for this fucking Skull? Marreco, mark 15 minutes... inform the superior of this shit... say the bullet came from who the fuck knows. And say that me and Commander F?bio... were not on location. Right, F?bio? Let's go, F?bio. Let's get the fuck out. Let's go, F?bio! You won't investigate his death, Secretary? We're waiting on Ballistics, Colonel. The ballistics are this, Formoso:... Andr? died from a bullet in the back... far from his squad, and the arms weren't there. Nascimento, I understand your pain... I know this is difficult... but you must understand the public supported the operation. 11 dealers dead and 15 weapons seized. Major Matias was a casualty. Could have been anyone. Matias wasn't just anyone. Salute. Fire! Attention! Colonel F?bio? Can I speak with you for a minute? Colonel. A terrible loss to our organization. My condolences. Excuse me. I will investigate his death. And I will find out what happened to Andr?, F?bio. If you know something, you'd better tell me now. Nascimento, Andr? was also my friend. And I believe in my men. If you find out anything, let me know. This is gonna go to shit. - Go to shit, why? - Because it will. What did you want me to do? The guy gets in my face... - and I sit there? - So what? And Nascimento's on my ass. - Who's on your ass. - Nascimento! Fuck Nascimento. - Kojak, coffee, please. - Water for me. - Hey, Nunes? - Major. Commander. Listen, buddy. Nascimento doesn't have anything on us. And another thing, partner. If I'm in deep shit, you're in deep shit. You should remember that. And you should know that now everything's 50-50. 50-50, no fucking way, F?bio. Fucking way. The "I know" tax, Rocha. The what tax? Are you out of your mind? You forgot? If you wanna giggle, you gotta tickle. Motherfucker. Kojak, hold that shit. - I'm off, Nunes. - It's all on his tab now, Kojak. - Ok, commander. - Nunes, how's everything? Like an ocean, boss. Salty, ain't it? Took me a long time to realize my work in the government... had nothing to do with public security. Valmir, we're not going to renew the requests... for the wiretaps of the operation in the Tanque. Excuse me. Colonel Nascimento said... That's all, Valmir. Thank you. It was all a stategy to get votes. To them, Matias' death meant nothing. In the media, the operation had been a success. That was all that mattered. You called Rafa? - No. - What is it, Beto? - What happened? - They killed Andr?. I heard. Are you taking care of yourself? I don't know what's happening. I'm going to find out. We haven't been talking... for some time. - Beto... - He was right. - Andr? was right. - Beto, I want to know about Rafa. I'm sorry about Andr?... but I want you to call your son. You're alienating yourself, Beto. Don't do this to your son. He was only protecting his friend. You should be proud. Don't waste time... don't wait for him to want to talk to you. Call Rafa to have a chat. You're gonna trade your neck for your arm? Breathe. Relax. Breathe. Come. Come. Mount. Get on. Son! You think I believed that weed was yours? Julia must be pretty hot for you to take the rap... for 100 grams of weed right in front of me, huh? I'm not afraid of you. I don't want you to be afraid of me. I want you to know that I'm your father. I know. - Do you? - I do. - You really know? - I know. Wow, I'll even let you grab my arm again. Grab it. You only grab it when I let you. Wait, wait. Yes, Valmir. I know... You know why this will go on, Valmir? You know why this will go on? Because what they want are votes, Valmir. I don't want votes, I want to know who killed Andr?. I appreciate it, then. I'm with my son, we'll talk later, ok? Ok. Thanks. Thank you. Your friend died in the operation? Something to do with the militia that stole the guns? Who told you this? I bet a year's salary that it was the militia... who stole the guns and will invade the slum... I'll accept it, but only as an investigative report. Investigative? - More than... - I need deeper. I need documents, photos, statements. Infiltrate. Disguise yourself. Figure it out. Camelo, wait. Give me the cover then. Bring me the goods, all right? You'll give me the cover? Tap the landline now. Today. The mobile, put it on account of some probe. I want to hear everything Fraga says... - to this journalist, got it? - Colonel... - he's a representative. - I take full responsibility. What time do you get off? Hey partner, can't hear you well. Still hissing. I'll check the signal. - Ok. - Beautiful. Preparing to record. Recording. If it were up to Rocha... the militia would enter Tanque real slow. No one would even notice. Look here, Clara, here. You see the scratch there? You see? - Where? The white bit? - That's it. What about it? I think it's the coat-of-arms of the police. They scratched it out to disguise themselves. But the election was coming up. They were pushing... and Rocha set up camp in the house of a widow. - I have to go in somehow. - Easy, easy, easy. - I have to go in. - Easy! And gas? Gas got us 8,600. This here keeps sadness at bay. A beautiful thing, my friend. As soon as the media forgot Tanque... the militia would probably microwave her. Mrs. Olga, first month in advance. Her house would become HQ for the police patrol... and Rocha would terrorize the slum. An almost perfect plan. Look. I think they're leaving. Easy, easy, Clara. Easy, Clara. Forget easy. Let's go! Hide the camera. Come on. The photos were already enough for the cover. Say that we're a couple looking for a rental. But journalists, my friend, are curious. Clara wouldn't rest until she discovered... what was in that house. How's this thing here? Twenty. Aranha, have a ball. Keep an eye out, they're fuckers. When they get more, it's fucked... - Hey, godfather. - Fucking around? - We did the collection. - Goddamn it. I told you not to walk around with these guns in Tanque. We went quickly and came back. - Who stayed at at the base? - Who's at the base? - No one. - No fucking one? Didn't I tell you to call... Are you fucking kidding me? Shit, Nunes. 20 years in this shit, huh. Like I told you, the price is 700. Ok, deal. When a journalist smells a scoop, get out the way. It's a bit messy... but take a look, and I'll be back, ok? Ok, thank you. - It's great. - Clara sweet-talked the widow... promised her the world and the widow was as high as a kite. Hello. Hi, Mrs. Olga, yes? No, I'm not gonna pay more than what we agreed. What couple, Mrs. Olga?! - That's how people are... - Clara... they only care about themselves. Check this out. - Whoa. - Hello. Get the camera. Fraga, it's Clara. Fraga, I'm in the Tanque neighborhood. Doing what, Clara? I found the guys who stole the guns from the station. Now I'm certain it was the militia. Clara, listen to me. Get out now, Clara. These people are very dangerous. No, it's ok. It's all ok. No, I went in the house. You won't believe this. I found the Governor's campaign materials. There's posters, banners, everything. No, it's full of photos of the Governor with Fortunato and Guaracy. Clara, who are you with? Are you alone? Calm down... Who's on the phone, bitch? - Give me that. - Take it easy. - What are you doing here? - Take it easy... - Clara? Can you hear me? - Take it easy... Hello? Clara? - What's wrong? - Where are the car keys? - What happened? - The militia's got Clara. There's at least 20 years of jail for us here. - Oh yeah? You're X9? You're what? - No. You scared? You scared? Motherfucker. You scared? Stop it! Take this bitch to the living room. - Get the fuck up. - Give me the keys. Let the police take care of it... The police are exactly the problem. Honey, give me the keys. Call me then, please. Diogo, for God's sake. Diogo! Rep. Fraga. Who else knows you're here? You want to get a beating then? Don't do that, boss. She's fine. Let me play with her first. Finish with her, then, and then clean up the mess. No! - Take off your clothes. - No. - Take off your fucking clothes. - No! Chief. Nothing? Well, Representative, that's it. Without evidence it's hard, you know? No witnesses, nothing. Look, if we find a body, any clue... you'll be the first to know, ok? She was telling me on the phone... she had found the stolen weapons, before she was interrupted. Obviously, she was surprised by those guys. You have to publish this, Camelo. I've got nothing to publish, I have no proof. Proof, Camelo?! The government is our partner. My hands are tied. What you have on your hands is a missing employee. Obviously, the militia killed Clara and ditched her body. What body, Fraga? She was working for your paper. All this came with the job. To be or not to be, that is the question, partner. What would be more noble for the militia? Kill the vermin that enter our lives... or live to enjoy the buzz of a beer? Tell me, Gon?alves. Enough with the bullshit! You're quoting the bible, now? Bible? It's a novella, you dumbfuck. - Hurry. Pull those teeth out. - This shit stinks. But are you sure the journalist called Fraga? Guaracy, there's a 3-minute call here. You think for a bedtime story? She opened her trap. Goddamn it. This is very serious, huh, Representative. What are we gonna do? "We"? What are YOU gonna do? Fraga is your problem. Representative, easy, Fraga is our problem. And we take care of our problems. Farewell, Guaracy. I found the guys who stole the arms from the station. Now I'm certain it was the militia. Clara, listen to me. Get out now, Clara. These people are very dangerous. You won't believe this. I found the Governor's campaign commitee. There's posters, banners, everything. No, it's full of photos of the Governor with Fortunato and Guaracy. Clara, who are you with? Are you alone? Who's on the phone, bitch? - Hello? Clara? - Give me that. - Take it easy! - Play the end, Valmir, just the end. You won't believe this. I found the Governor's campaign commitee. There's posters, banners, everything. No, it's full of photos of the Governor with Fortunato and Guaracy. Clara, who are you with? Are you alone? - When was this, Valmir? - 11 p.m. - Is it in the system? - Not yet. It's here, in my recorder. It's like I got punched in the face. In one blow... I had discovered it wasn't just the militia... that was behind the arms robbery,... Clara's disappearance, and Andr?'s murder. The militia wouldn't campaign for the Governor... and Guaracy for free. The hole went a lot deeper. I was surrounded by enemies. Real enemies. The Secretariat of Security was the core of the system. Public security in the State of Rio de Janeiro... was in the hands of crooks. - And I could trust no one. - Nascimento. Perfect, I'll deliver it. The arms robbery and Matias' death... meant nothing for the system. The system is ruled by politics... and politics only respects the media. Only this time, the militia had killed a journalist. The system would have to catch up. - Valmir. - Secretary. Valmir, tap this number for me. This is the phone of Rep. Fraga? Tap it. - It was already intercepted. - How's that? Colonel Nascimento ordered its interception. Fine, give me a copy... and you can delete the file. He just took it with him. The evidence had been microwaved. There were no witnesses. It was right in my face. The system was going to kill Fraga. And soon. - Did you like it, son? - Fraga was next. Goddamn it, Rosane. Rosane, it's Roberto again. I'm on your street... I'll wait for you at the door of your building, ok? When you get this message.. I'll be at your building door, you'll find me there. - Your dad called, Rafa? - Why? Nothing... just to know. - Mom, there's Dad! - Your Dad? No! Stay in the car! Rosana. Rafa! - Get in the car! - Talk to me, Rafa! Drive! Drive! Go! Go! Go! Oh my god! Go! What did the doctor say? The surgery will take 7 to 8 hours... because he was shot in the kidney. He said he will be... he will... - Beto... - I'll be back, I'll be back. Even by chance... the system ends up hurting us where it hursts most. It's going to take 7 to 8 hours... I spent my entire life... believing that the police could do the right thing. It'll be fine. One hour to the next, all that conviction was gone. I had no alternative. I'd have to hit the system head-on. Doctor, there's a checkpoint in front of your condo. How's that, Braddock? There's a checkpoint in front of your condo. Can I stop, Doctor? But, in Brazil, it's hard to arrest authorities. Pull over, so I can straighten them out. So a politician, forget it. Stop the fucking car. Imagine how fucked up it'd be if BOPE worked over a corrupt representative just like a dealer. Lower your weapon, son. Who's in charge here? I am. Wait... What's this? What's this? You motherfucker. Look at me. Look at me! If anything happens to my son... if anything happens to anyone in my family... if my son dies, I will kill everyone. You understand? Look at me! And the first to die will be you, you motherfucker. Your honor. You opened the CPI, your honor? - What's this? - What's this?! Have you read the paper? Dead journalist, Fortunato! - People die everyday! - What a mess. You subpoenaed Colonel Roberto Nascimento! - I did. - A CPI during elections... - helps this gentleman! - Cynical. You're a punk! - Cynical. - Calm down, Fortunato! If there's a CPI, I'll be the narrator! Narrator, my ass! In this CPI, Representative, you're under investigation. - Punk! - You're the punk. - Calm down. - I'll see you in session. - Punk! - Calm down, Fortunato. Fortunato, calm down! First, I'd like to say that this administration... supports the establishment of the CPI and hopes... that our representatives will help us discover the truth. I'd also like to say that the search for the... whereabouts of the journalist and photographer... was transferred to the kidnapping division... as there are no bodies, and no clues... I repeat, no evidence that they were murdered. The only evidence we have until now... is the electronic recording of Rep. Fraga... which was obtained illegally via a wiretap... ordered by Colonel Roberto Nascimento... in the house of his ex-wife to spy on her. The Governor, obviously... has relieved Colonel Nascimento of his duties and the military police... has initiated the process of his expulsion. The politicians were not interested in my dying... before I testify. I'd become a martyr of human rights in the middle of a CPI... and Fraga would turn the Governor... into a murder suspect. But the system doesn't have central planning... nor a board of directors, my friend. The system is an inhuman mechanism... an expression of twisted interests. Let's go, folks. It's time. - Sup, boss. - Sup. I told you to hide the shirt. Come on. Pull in the front, Nunes. The Governor did what was best for him... he smeared my name and ended my police career. I have to go, ok? Call me if there's anything. The tactic of the militia would be different. Rocha knew if someone had to go down in the CPI... the politicians would dump it all on him. Aranha, see where he is. Where are you, partner? I'm in front of the pub. We'll wait behind the hospital. Tell us when he comes out, ok? For the militia, the sooner I died, the better. He's going to the parking lot. Attention. He's coming out. He's at the door. Pull out, partner. Pull out. Let's go, get that cocksucker! Luckily, I discovered... my true enemies in time. When they came, I wasn't alone. - You ok? - Skulls. He's on the ground. I'm in, I'm in, I'm in. Behind the fucking car! Go! Go! Get the other one get the other one! Let's go. Go! The motherfucker escaped... but my war on the system was just beginning. Now it was personal. And I would keep fighting, but in a different way. Silvio, please. The last page of the document is missing. Tell them I need a xerox to distribute. Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen. May I have your attention... so that we may hear the testimony of... - Colonel Roberto Nascimento. - One moment, please. I'd like to utter a few words before this circus. Representative, please. This CPI was opened on the eve of elections. This is just part of an electoral campaign. You are a clown! You're plotting against the city of Rio de Janeiro. You do not have the right to speak. I'm cutting your microphone. Rep. Diogo Fraga, you are a clown! You're plotting against our city. You're plotting against us! Gentlemen, please. - Let's get to the questions. - A circus! Colonel Nascimento, are you ready? Can we start with the questions? If you'll allow... I would like to say a few words... before answering questions. You may. Take all the time you need. My name is Roberto Nascimento. I am Lieutenant-Colonel of the Military Police... of the State of Rio de Janeiro. I've dedicated 21 years of my life to the police. It is thus not easy, what I'm about to say... but the truth is that the MP of Rio needs to be abolished. Please. When my son was 10... he asked me why my job was to kill. My son Rafael, who is now in the hospital... victim of a gunshot. And I couldn't answer him. I've been a cop 21 years and I couldn't say... for what and for whom I killed. But what I can say, without a doubt, Representatives... is that a cop doesn't pull the trigger alone. Rep. Fraga, half of your colleagues in this house... should be in jail. Gentlemen, please. I request silence for the testimony. Please. - Half is low, Representative. - Let's maintain silence! Please. Please. Half is low, Representative. There are only 6 or 7 with a clean sheet. Gentlemen, let's maintain silence for the testimony. Please. Rep. Fortunato, you are the leader... of one of the largest criminal organizations in this city. Please! Let's maintain silence, please. You act in concert with the Commander... the ex-Commander of the MP of the State of Rio... and ex-Secretary of Security, Guaracy Novaes... one of the worst crooks that I've had the displeasure of knowing... in my life as a police officer. And I can affirm here, Representative... that the Governor of the State of Rio de Janeiro... is directly involved in the crimes... under investigation here in this house. I affirm that the Governor of the State is involved... in the crimes investigated by Rep. Diogo Fraga. Rep. Fortunato, you are responsible for... more than 20 murders in the West Side of the city. Among which, you are responsible for the murder of my friend... Captain of the Military Police, Andr? Matias. Gentlemen, please! Let's maintain silence, please. Let's refrain... I went to Fraga's CPI to detonate the system. I went to speak the truth. To say what I felt. I told everything I knew, I acknowledged my errors... and spoke for over 3 hours. And knocked down a lot of people. I put many corrupt politicians in jail. Thanks to my speech, there were fuckers... who ended up in a ditch long before I had hoped. It was the biggest paper- shredding in Rio's history. And even then, the system remained standing. Take his gold and put the anchor on that piece of shit. The system cuts off its hand to save its arm. The system reorganizes, entertains new interests. Creates new leadership. Gentlemen, four more years! Congratulations! - Congratulations! - Congratulations, everyone! As long as the conditions for the system's existence remained... it would resist. We all know that Rep. Guaracy... was elected with money from crime, with money from the militia. If you confirm him as president of this commission... you will certify that you are like him... crooks dressed up as representatives of the people... I request to speak. ...the source of injustice! Calm down, Representative. You do not qualify to be a congressman. - I will not accept... - Do not quality your challenging my competence... - A representative of crime... - and that of my colleagues. cannot be a representative of the people! I was democratically elected president of this council. - Democratically! - With the evidence... - it's irrefutable! - I was elected... and you will have to swallow your defamatory accusations. What I can't swallow is your criminal record! Because I will assume my duties here... whether you like or not. Now answer me this... who do you think sustains all this? Yeah... And it costs. It costs a lot. The system is much bigger than I thought. There's a reason dealers, cops and militias... kill so many people in the slums. There's a reason the slums even exist. There's a reason for all the scandals in Brasilia and... regardless of administration, for corruption to continue. Change takes a long time. The system is fucked up. A lot of innocent folks will keep dying. Rafa!
