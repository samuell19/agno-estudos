Wow, it looks like you're enjoying each other's company! Warden, you are so hardheaded! - Oh, why? Is your foot really better? Who are you calling "hardheaded?" I said I'm fine! I'm going to join! Fine. As long as you're "it." - Game! - Is that your style? I'm coming! It looks like you're swimming. That's where it all begins... Sir Erick, promise us. When you get married, you'll invite us to Malacanang, okay? Don't they make a perfect pair? Oh, Sir Erick, go sit beside her. Mister Mario... - Perfect! - One shot for Sir Erick! And one shot for Roan! Come on, one more round! - Hey, let Mister Mario sleep. - I'll go ahead, sir. - He's already drunk. - My wife would get mad at me. - Party-pooper! - Ouch! You are really, really hard-headed. Stubborn, stubborn, stubborn! What's that, huh? Are you trying to test me? - What? - You really want to try me? - What's that? - Really now? - What are you talking about? - That's it! What the... ah! Erick, ouch! Roan... - Roan, give that to me. - Okay. Thank you. - You take care. - Thank you! - Mister Cris! - Thank you so much, Sir Erick. It was an honor to have you visit our community. From now on, I will not waste even just one granule of rice... because I'll remember you. Okay Sir. Don't hesitate to come back when you have time. - Oh Roan! - Roan, come here! Miss Bic-bic. - Here. Some souvenirs for your family. - Thank you. I'll return soon to take care of the day care center. - Oh, really? - Yes. - Will you be coming back together? - Oh no. I'll be alone. - Oh, why? - Well, we'll go ahead. Thank you so much! - Okay, take care! - Take care, Sir! Sir, what? That's it? - Erick, Roan, take care. - Okay, bye! - Take care! - No thanks. Sir, thank you very much! Take care! - You too, sir! Thank you, Sir! - Goodbye! - Bye! - Ma'am. - Thank you. Oh, no. I'm fine. I'll just get my bags. - Here. - Thank you. How are you going home? - I can give you a ride. - No need. Roan! - Good evening, Sir. - Where's Papa? They had a lot of deliveries so they asked me to pick you up. Okay, I'll get those. The taxi's waiting outside. You might want to hitch with me. No, it's alright. Thank you. Thank you. Let's go. Roan, I have a new rap for the girl I want to court. Vitto, I'm tired. Let's not do this tonight. Okay, maybe next time. - Roan! - Roan! - Is that your evaluation of Erick? - What? Did he pass? Why don't you share what happened during your immersion? What happened? Something probably developed between the two of you, right? - No. - That would be exciting! Charms, can you stop? That was just work. Okay, okay. Stop bothering me already. I still need to finish this. Come on. You never know, he might be the man in your dreams. - He is. - What? You mean, he already revealed his face? Your dreams went beyond the nape already? Yes. That's what I was saying! The first time I saw you two together, I knew he was the guy for you. Hey. Wake up! Roan Sanchez from Caloocan? - He wouldn't like me. - Why? Because he's Erick Rodriguez from Malacanang? Hey, why are you so negative? - Realistic. - You never know... maybe Roan really did get to him. No. Girlie, you know what, you're right. I'm not his type. Haven't you seen his ex-girlfriends? Beautiful, sexy, rich. In other words, within his social status. But me? Who am I? I'm just a mere mortal compared to them. Dad? I just received the report from your Santa Catalina immersion. - Dad, I can explain. - No need. Roan's evaluation is very comprehensive. And of course, her recommendation for you. - Ah, so? - Keep it up. Dude, seriously? I can't believe you passed the evaluation, man. So, what d'you do? Bribe them. No. - Ah, I bet you beat them up. - Dude, she's a girl. Okay. Okay. I get it, I get it. No. No, dude, she's not like that. Nothing happened. - She was like a warden. - Warden? So she got you to do things that your dad cannot make you do, huh? So, who's this warden girl, huh? So what? You're in love with her now? Is that it? You're in love? That's why, children... we'll be making a "Thank You" card for President Rodriguez. For the help he gave to build your learning center. Wonderful, right? And we should also thank Miss Roan... because she's the reason behind everything. - Mister Erick! - Roan, Sir Erick's here! How are you? Miss Roan, I thought you said Mister Erick won't be returning anymore. Is that possible? Of course, I missed you all. What's new with you, dude? I missed you. - Did you miss me? - I missed you. Especially you. I really, really missed you. You know, aside from the President's gift... I will also teach you how to play basketball. Is that alright? It's good that you returned for the kids. Of course. But not only for them. For Mister Mario, Mister Cris, Miss Bic-Bic. And... you. Okay, let's go down. Come on, hurry! Okay, be gentle. Wait, wait, wait. Okay. - You guys! - Thank you, Mister Erick! Wait, let me tie your shoelaces. Pass! Go, go! Okay. Let's go! Lay up! Nice! Concentrate. Do better, okay? Focus. Watch your follow-through. Your follow through. 1, 2, 3 Go Jun-jun! Shoot! Shoot! Okay, don't forget our plans. - Yes, Mister Erick. - You should always keep smiling. Okay, Mister Erick. You're my only hope! Erick. Are you still going to take long? It's getting dark. We still need to go back home. Okay. I'll just finish this up. I'll follow. This is our secret, alright? Yes, Manong Erick! - Why, what did they say? - I don't know. They just told me it's an emergency. They need you here at the day care. Hmmm, what's that? - Thank you! - Wow! Well, the kids have a question. They're asking what's your answer? Say yes! You know, Erick. You're using the kids for your antics. Huh? I didn't... Am I using you, kids? No. - Warden, I'm serious. - You might just start playing with me. I wouldn't do that to you. Yes! You might find someone sexier, prettier... oh no! You're the sexiest, the most beautiful in my eyes. Well, the day might come... when you'll be ashamed to be seen by the whole world with me... because who am I? I'm just Roan Sanchez of Caloocan City. And here I am... I'm Erick Rodriguez from Malacanang. And I'm asking you, "Will you be my girlfriend?" Say yes! Say yes! Say yes! Say yes! Say yes! Say yes! - Say yes! Say yes! Say yes! - Say yes! Say yes! Say yes! - Say yes! Say yes! Say yes! - Say yes! Say yes! Say yes! Say yes! Say yes! - Say yes! - Okay! Yes! - Yes? - Yes. Yes. Be careful, you might trip. Of course, I don't want my girlfriend to get hurt. Oh, really? Just earlier today, I wasn't your girlfriend. - What time is it? - Ah, you have a watch. Oh, yeah. I don't know with you. - Why? - I'm feeling giddy. - Me too. - You too? - I didn't know guys could feel giddy. - Of course, I'm not used to this. Come here. Erick, sorry. Well, how do I say this? Ah, well. I'm serious. How do I... - Because why? - My voice is changing. No, it's because you didn't even formally court me. And my family doesn't even know you. So, how do we go about this? Well, tomorrow, I'll introduce myself to them. I'll ask them formally. That's it? - Really? - Yeah. Just promise me, no take-backs. Everything running through your mind, your apprehensions. I'll do everything to dispel them from your thoughts. - Okay. - Okay. - Good night. Bye. - Wait. Why? Don't worry. I'm not in a hurry, okay? Okay. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night, mommy! - Good night, daddy! - Good night. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night. Good night. Good night. Oh, say good-night! - Good night, ma'am. - Good night! I didn't know they could speak? Good night! Sweet dreams, mommy! - What's that? - What's that? Let's have a look. - This is Erick. - Oh, hello, honey. Good afternoon. Ma! Wazzup bro? - Ma, he's here! - Who? The son of the... the son of the president! - Come inside. - Ma! Come in. Come in. Come in. Let's go. Prepare some snacks. The snacks! Hurry! Okay, okay. Come, help me. Hurry. Come on! Hurry up! Bro, what's happening here? Oh uh... hello, hello. Have a seat. How are we going to tell them? You're asking me? I don't even know. What is it? Pardon my family... Hey, get the glasses. - Ma... Pa... - Why? Erick and I would like to tell you something. We'd like to tell you something... I don't know how to go about this... At first... Oh my. Sorry. I just feel really embarrassed. I don't want you to think that I'm that kind of girl. But I promise, I'll stand by her. You might think that, in the short time I was away... when I came back, I'm suddenly... What? What is it? Just tell us! - Suddenly what?! - He's my boyfriend already! Your boyfriend is the son of the president? - Come on! - Yes! Oh come on! - You're such a liar! - I'm telling the truth! - Who said so? - You're so irritating! Yes. She's my girlfriend already. Roan! I love you! Roan! I love you! So, how many girlfriends have you had? What the... He'd be crazy to do anything to Roan! Can't you see how many guards surround him? Yes. My security's really tight. - So, you're always with them? - Yes, 24/7. Everywhere? Even when you're peeing? Bro! - Hey, Vitto! Come on, join us. - Ma! - Grab a seat for Vitto. - Dude, eat. Grab a seat. Vitto, this is Erick. Man, that's Roan's boyfriend. Unbelievable, right? Dude... Man, this is the only thing I could find. Hope you don't mind. - Okay Vitto, have a seat. - Vitto, come sit down. Excuse me. Do you want more food? Thank you very much! It's our anniversary this Saturday! Be there, okay? Of course. I'll be there. Promise. Okay. - Good night! - Okay, take care. - Good night, Roan. - Text me when you get home. Bye. - Roan. - Yes? - You take care of yourself, okay? - Papa... - Roan. - Yeah? If he plays with you, I'll make sure he'll pay for it. I mean, we'll make him pay for it... Come on. Let's go inside. - Roan, Roan, Roan! - Hurry! - Why? - Come here, Roan! Faster! Yes! - Wow, it's beautiful! - Does it suit me? Oh, there he is. I think I know who gave that! - Hello? - Did you get the flowers I sent? Yeah, I got them. They're beautiful. Thanks! - I love you. - I love you too. I can't hear you. What did you say? - I said, "I love you too." - Huh? What? Come on, please, please, please. I love you... I love you... I love you. Yes, I love you! She said, "I love you!" - What happened? - Oh, I gotta go. Bye. Hey, it's still early. Is it lunch break already? Back to work! - Have you eaten? - Hey Erick! Come, join us. Good evening, Mom. - Erick! - Dad. - Godfather! - Hi Erick. Good evening! - Hey Nicole. - Hey Erick. - How are you? - I'm fine. Welcome back. So, how's our country's most eligible bachelor doing? I'm doing great. Nicole was just telling us about her thrust in sports development... for our Filipino youth. We're planning to put up a sports center... and we're having our ground breaking soon. That's a good idea. Just let me know if you need any help. Well, that's right up your ally, Erick. Why don't you two collaborate in this project? I don't see why not. Yeah, yeah. Good. We should try this. - Thanks, Nicole. - You'll be working soon. Because our groundbreaking is already this Saturday. On Saturday? I'm sorry but I already have plans on Saturday. I will clear my schedule to support your first project, son. I hope you do the same. - Yes. Yes. - Alright. Good. - This is gonna be exciting. - Definitely. - I agree. - It's a great idea. It's a good thing we were all able to come together tonight. That's true. Mom, is Dad going to take long? Relax, he came from an out of town inauguration. It's Roan's parents' wedding anniversary today. Just make up for it next time. Besides, I think she should start to get used to it, don't you? Mom, how can you stand everything? Because I love him. I believe in his convictions that's why I support him 100 percent. I hope Roan would be the same to you. Come on. Oh your dad's here already. - Hon. - Hi hon! Okay, family picture! Roan... Paolo... Jojo! - Here, take our picture. - Okay, picture! - Picture! - Picture! - Is your boyfriend coming? - He said he'll follow. Can you ask him to help me with my visa? He's the son of the President. He's not the consul at the US Embassy. My gosh, you're depriving us of your connections! We could help you get a visa to Libya. The consul is my good friend. You want? That's enough. Let's take our picture! - Here. - 1, 2, smile! Is he still coming? Why don't you call him? He'll call when he's free. I thought he's your boyfriend. Then why don't you call him so you'd know if he's still coming or not? If I were you, I'd text him immediately. Vitto, you're adding to my pressure. I am so honored to be part of this program. And I'm thankful for the unique experience of being part of an immersion... that exposed me to the grassroots level... which inspired me to develop more sports-themed programs on this level. This is just the beginning. I know, with your help, our endeavors would be highly successful. Thank you very much. - Happy Anniversary! - There! - Cheesy, cheesy! - Cheessssyyy! - Pa! - Happy Anniversary! Hey Dan, you know, Roan's the hot topic on Twitter and Facebook now. Well, of course. Somebody tweeted that they saw Erick and Roan together in a photo. Hmm, what did they say? Well, it's a bit negative. They said they don't suit each other. They also said it's because Roan isn't that pretty, anyway. Like, what did Erick see in her anyway? - Sis, can you pass the dessert? - Wait for a while. - I shall reply to their tweets. - What are you going to say? Nothing... I'll just start a fight with them. Those witches! They're jealous, nosy witches! Wait. Erick. Okay. - Erick. - Hello, Roan? What happened to you? Erick, let's go. Everyone is looking for us. Roan, I'll call you later, okay? I'll call again. - Wow, so many gifts! - Nicole Morales! Hello, hotness! I'd like to know, what made you come up with a project like this? Actually, I'm really into sports... and that's why I ask for support of people who share the same passion... like Erick Rodriguez. Erick, come join us. I'm so happy that Erick is part of this project. - So thank you for all of your help. - Hey, isn't that Erick? One last question... So is there anybody in the picture right now? I'd like to keep that private, if you don't mind. Oh really now? Excuse me, I really need to go. Thank you. Thank you. - Nicole. - Bye. He's crazy. - Honey. - Yes? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I just need to get something. - Oh, we have a visitor. - Okay, that's enough. Good evening. Hi Sir Erick! Happy anniversary! I'm sorry, I'm late. Roan's inside. - Erick. - Happy Anniversary. Thank you. Come inside. - Roan, Erick's here. - Okay, Ma. - I'll leave you two alone. - Okay. We're good. Roan. Roan, I'm really, really sorry. I didn't expect the event would stretch that long. No, it's alright. - So, how was your groundbreaking? - It was great. I gave a speech and my dad seemed to be happy about it. Even the press... Roan... I am so sorry. Please, don't be mad anymore. No, it's just... I called you so many times. I texted you... but you never called again. I already told you, I'm going to be busy at the event. I know, I know. That's why it's okay... It's just... I don't know! Okay, I promise I won't let that happen again. Okay? I saw your interview on TV. So... that's Nicole. And? Roan, Nicole is just my partner for the project. I know. The press really liked the two of you. It's because they still don't know you already have a girlfriend, right? Yes. Because I'm trying to protect you. I don't want us to be exploited in the tabloids. I don't want to drag you into all that nonsense. Roan, I want our relationship to be private. But if you want, tomorrow, I'll arrange for a press conference. - I'll announce it to everyone. - That's not what I'm asking for, okay? What do you want me to do? I don't know. You know what, sometimes I wonder if this is right. Is it right that I entered into this relationship? It just seems so hard. Yes, I understand. I understand who you are, who you are to them... but it's really hard. I don't know how many more missed occasions I could take. And I don't know how much more I can take... hearing people saying that we don't belong with each other. That, I'm not the one for you. Sometimes, I wonder... what if... What if we just finish this while it's still easy? While it's still early? While no one's getting hurt yet? I think that would just be easier, right? Let's just end this. You could do that? No. Sorry. Okay. Alright. I'm sorry. Hey, what time is it? You have a watch. Come here. I'm sorry. I'm sorry too. Just be yourself and enjoy. - Okay? - Okay. Let's go? Relax. I'll take care of you. - Hello Erick. - Hello. - Hello Erick. - Good evening. - Good evening, Erick. - Good evening. - Excuse me. - Okay, go ahead. - Hey Nicole! - Hi Erick, how are you? I'm okay. Hi I'm Nicole Morales and you are? This is Roan, my girlfriend. Oh. I didn't know you're seeing someone exclusively. Well, now you know. Ladies and gentlemen... the President of the Republic of the Philippines... His excellency, President Enrique Rodriguez Jr. And First Lady Madame Elena Rodriguez. - Son. - Dad. - Mom. - Hi Uncle! - Hello Nicole! - Hi Auntie! - I thought you were right behind me. - Oh, was I supposed to? Dad, Mom. Roan. - Hello. - Good evening, madame. - Roan. - Sir. Hon, shall we? Can't we just occupy another table? Of course not. Relax, alright? - Okay. - Relax. So Mr. President, your term ends in a few months... do you have any plans? Well I haven't thought of it yet but I might take time to rest first. Well I think some rest will do you good hon. So no other political endeavors, Mr. President? It depends. I think Governor Morales is running for the next elections. Is Nicole next in line? Uncle, I'm not ready for that yet. Well I think your activities now are preparing you for a great future ahead. This is really good. It seems that you will have a busy year Nicole. Gosh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. It's okay. No. No. No. Don't worry about it. It's okay. That's alright. So what is your next plan after this fund raising? We're in the process of evaluating the candidates for Erick's sports program. Good! So we're targeting areas such as Northern Luzon. But that area is more of Nicole's focus. I'll be focusing on the Metro Manila area. Starting with Caloocan. I already have meetings set up with the youth councils... so I can coordinate with the government. Oh no, Erick. I won't go with you when you do your rounds there. Because my friend's car broke down in Caloocan... and then after that, he got mugged by drug addicts. His car got stolen and then he was beaten up. It's such a scary place. Oh my goodness, Erick. Double up your security when you're there. And you, my dear, you should always be careful. Because I know you're always on the go. Where do you live again? In Caloocan. My gosh. I can't believe that's Erick's date! Yeah! Who she is, anyway? She's not even dressed for the occasion. She looks so ordinary. She looks like a maid. His taste has deteriorated. I just hope he wakes up soon... and realizes what a big mistake he's making with that girl. Come on. Let's go. Do you think she heard us? I don't care. I'm sorry about what I said earlier. I didn't mean to offend you. That's okay. Anyway, the program's about to start. I'll see you there. - Okay. - Okay. Erick, I saw Roan inside the ladies' room earlier. - She doesn't look like she's okay. - What, are you sure? Ladies and Gentlemen... Mr. Enrique Rodriguez III and Miss Nicole Morales... of the Philippines Sports Bureau. Good evening, Sir. Roan. Roan, wait up. Roan, what's the problem? Nothing. I just really wanted to leave. Roan, let's go. I'll take you home. Come on. No. No. Go back there. You're needed there. Roan. Roan, wait a minute. Did I do something to offend you? Did something happen inside? Roan? Erick, I don't think I can take this anymore. Roan, please. Let's talk about this. I know... Everyone's going to say that I'm so stupid. That I'm the one who has the guts to break up with you? Because who am I, anyway, right? But Erick, no matter what I do... No matter how many times I tell myself... "No, it's okay, everything's okay..." It doesn't work. My insecurities still get the better of me. My gosh, Erick. If you only knew. I don't even know if I should jump for joy... knowing that we'll be seeing each other again. Or if I should hide under my blanket in fear because... Because I know that I would need to face another day as your girlfriend. I don't understand you. I just feel like... Like I'm so small compared to you. Like everyone keeps asking... That's her? Really, her? Erick, why me? Why did you choose me... when there are so many other girls to choose from who'd be perfect for you? No. You're the one who's perfect for me. You're the one who's important to me. So please. Don't do this to me. You made me understand so many things... about my family... About myself. Roan, you've changed me. You made me a better person. I really, really love you. I really, really love you too. That's why I want to leave. Because Erick, I don't like what's happening to me now. I'm always afraid. That one day... you'll just realize that you don't want to be with me anymore. Erick... I'm sorry. Sorry for what happened. I'm sorry for leaving early. And for failing you again. No son. I'm the only one who always ends up failing you. I will never forget when I was in grade 3. During the father and son kite flying. Did you know I was the only one without a father there? Because you needed to go to the Congress. Dad, you have no idea... You have no idea how angry I was at this country. Because they took my father away from me. That's why I promised myself, I will never be like you. But somebody changed my life. She taught me to... She taught me to appreciate you. But she's gone now. Roan's gone. I'm sorry, son. I'm sorry. But seeing you now... I cannot think of ways to thank Roan on how she has changed you. Did she see us? Ma, Pa, I saw you already. - Honey... - Yes? I'm okay, don't worry. Honey, we know that's not true... I knew it, he's just going to make you cry. Pa, it's not like that... You're still defending him? You probably love him? So much. So why did you break up with him if you still love him? Did he cheat on you? Did he hurt you? Ma, he's not like that. We're just not fit for each other. Did he say that? No, I did. And the rest of the public. Well, you're the one who has a problem. Honey, you loved a famous person. You shouldn't allow yourself to get affected if you really love him. Don't think that you and Erick aren't perfect for each other. Even if it were any guy. I know how pure your heart is. Even if it was Justin Bieber or Prince William. Well, they'd be so lucky if you would love them. - I love you. - Papa! - Justin Bieber?! - Love you, honey. I love you too, Pa. I love you, Ma. - I love you, honey. - Thank you. Oh, good morning, handsome! - Good morning, beautiful! - Yes, I know. - Thanks! - You're welcome. Wait a minute. - I told you not to read that! - Ma, it's okay. There's a fire in the other town. It's a good thing we're safe. Really? Is that in the news? Oh, it's Erick. Sir Erick, when you leave... what will you miss here in the Philippines? A lot, of course. My family. The people. My mother. My father. - My mommy... - Where will you be going? I'll be going to the US. And I'll be leaving immediately after the presscon. Excuse me, I have to go. That's Mr. Erick Rodriguez. Live! - Go, go! Hurry! - Pa, faster! Hurry! - Hurry up, hurry up! - Pa, faster! The fastest you could drive, okay? Let's go, Pa! Come! Erick, here we come! Ah... Oh nooo! Will we still be able to make it? Cannot be reached! Shucks! Of course you can't contact him. He's at a presscon, remember? Oh, yeah. - Pa, what's happening? - Everyone go down! - Of all days... - Push. Push! Oh no, what if the presscon's done already? Oh, there! Sir, sir! Sir, can I hitch a ride with you? To Manila Hotel, okay? Come on, please. Emergency! Manila Hotel! Sir, over here. Just here. You're heaven-sent, sir! Thank you. Hey, wait! You still have to pay! - Good morning! - Good morning! Oh, wait, wait. Where's Erick's presscon? - Straight ahead, ma'am. - Oh, okay. Thank you. Erick, let's talk. I love you! I love you too. - Sorry. - It's okay. Uh, where's Erick Rodriguez's presscon? - At the other room. - Oh. Okay, thank you. - You're welcome. - Oh, shocks. You're my fan! I mean, I'm your fan. There! Idol! Thank you. Bye! Shucks, that was embarrassing! Hurry! Follow her! Hey, we're not yet done. Wait! Where? Where is Erick? - He went ahead. - He already left? - You might catch him already. - Oh my gosh, what now? Miss Roan! Miss Roan! Erick! Erick! Oh, wait! - Erick! - Sir? Erick! Roan! Wait, wait a minute. I got tired. Wait, wait. Wait for a while. Sorry. - Please don't leave. - Why? I thought we were over? Yeah, that's the thing... I was wrong. I'm sorry. Yes, I got insecure before... Because I got hurt from the opinions of the public. And because of the way I started to think of myself. But it was more painful when you left, Erick. So... What do you want to happen now? Well, I don't care what the other people will say anymore. All I know is, I now accept who I am. And I'm ready to love again, Erick. Do I still have a chance? - Do you still love me, warden? - Yes. Huh? - I love you. - Huh? - I love you. - I can't hear anything. I love you! I really love you, Erick! Wow! You're as cheesy as mama and papa! What about me? Do you still love me? Of course. I really, really love you. My throat got itchy. It's just a cough. I don't think they want us to... Ma. Okay fine. I'll settle for a hug. Kiss! Kiss! - I love you, your highness! - I love you, warden!
