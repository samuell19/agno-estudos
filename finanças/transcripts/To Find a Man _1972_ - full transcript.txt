(CHOIR SINGING) * Oh come all ye faithful * Joyful and triumphant * Oh, come ye, * Oh, come ye to Bethlehem * Come and behold Him * For the King of angels * Oh, come let us adore Him * Oh, come let us adore Him * Oh, come let us adore Him * Christ, the Lord (SINGING CONTINUES) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) -Did you get it? -Shh. MAXINE: Castor oil? I can't drink all this. That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. That's what the cleaning lady said to do. Take some more. Ugh! I can't... (BELL RINGING) All you need are a couple of your father's heart attack pills, and the baby falls right out. My father doesn't take heart attack pills. Wait till he finds out you're pregnant. I heard that if you bake grapefruit, not one grapefruit but a whole lot of grapefruits for about an hour and eat the white stuff inside if you peel the white stuff and you eat it and it gets you real sick and you have an abortion. Where've you been? We nearly got caught. I sure hope this makes more sense than all the other dumb things I've been doing. I don't know from practical experience. I'm just telling you what the sewing woman said. Won't the bubbles tickle? It's the sugar or something. Maybe some kind of chemical in the cola part makes the membranes expand. The cervix opens up and the baby falls out. What if it opens up in the middle of chapel? It's supposed to open up right away. It seems crazy to me. When do you leave for Acapulco? Three or four days, I think. And then you come right back to school. Don't you think I know that? (CAR HONKING) How are you, Mrs. McCarthy? Very well. Thank you, sister. -Hiya sweetie, how are you? -I'm okay. You look terrific, I think you lost weight, didn't you? Hiya sweetie, my baby. You hate that, right? You hate that, uh. Get the bags, girls, okay? You're taking Maxine with you today, Mrs. McCarthy? Yes. Actually her mother was supposed to pick them up this time but she's an actress and their schedules are so irregular. Goodbye, Sister. Have a happy holiday. -Bye, sister. -Good bye, sister. Good bye, sister. Merry Christmas. Happy holiday. Come on, girls. Hurry up, get the bags in. (CAR ENGINE STARTS) Do you like school, Maxine? It's all right. Is Rosalind behaving herself? How could I not behave myself? They watch you every minute like a prison. Any time you want to, my darling, you can come home to the muggers in Central Park. (WHISTLES) (MOTORCYCLE REVVING) Okay, button your blouse. For God sakes, mother, I can't help it if I've got big boobs. A more dignified word might be breasts. Tch. Sorry, darling, you can give me all the dirty looks you want. There's no way you can provoke me. What did I say? You don't see Maxine acting that way, do you? She has respect for her mother. Her mother treats her like a friend. Not like you treat me. How do I treat you? Like a thing. Do you know if Andy's going away for the holidays? I don't think so. They had reservations for Switzerland. His grandmother got sick and his parents had to go to Rochester. -I don't know, why? -Nothing. Hey, Andy, Andy. It's all set. Now Sarah says it's okay. Now you gotta let us use your house. I told you, forget it. Hey, Sarah! (CHILDREN CLAMORING) (CHILDREN LAUGHING) Why can't we? We just can't, that's all. Why not? Because my maid's still there. We could sneak her up in your bedroom. Sarah, listen, I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Okay. Gotta go home. -Why the hell can't we? -You're crazy. In the first place, she's not going to do it with all three of us. How do you know? I mean, if she's willing to do it with Tomo -she'll do it with anybody. -She likes me. Did you ever actually try to do it to her? How could I? Where? We never even had a date. Why not. For God sakes? You said you were going to. With her, me and my mother? Watching some ballet, for God sakes. And then what? Some hot chocolate at the Plaza? The chick said she wanted to make it with me. I can't take her out on a date with my mother, for God sakes. Hey, you. Andy Morisson. Come here, I want to talk to you. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? I can't let an empty house go to waste. See you, Andy. Were you calling me? Do you mind stepping into my private drugstore? I'm freezing out here. Sit down. From you I expect a little artistic merit at least. What's this? Don't give me that innocent look like you're the boyfriend of Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm or something. Are you trying to suggest that I put this thing on your window? By now a man of your advanced intelligence should be able to distinguish the difference between a suggestion and an irate accusation. Did your parents leave already? Last night. You want a malted? No, thanks. I'm on a diet. Diet? Not to lose weight. I'm on this Zen macrobiotic thing. Till my mother gets back. Whatever turns you on. It's going to bring me instant enlightenment. I'm not complaining. Because I know that next week your mother's going to come in here and buy about twenty dollars worth of medicine for you. I only wish all my customers were on your diet. You know something, Doctor Katchaturian? You've got the soul of an innate mystic. I have got the soul of an innate cockroach. (LAUGHS) -See ya. -Hey, listen. If you need anything I want you to give me a call. Your mother told me to tell you. She told everybody in town. -Will you do me a favor, please? -Certainly. Will you mail this for me? Modesta? Anybody home? Modesta? Once more into the breach, dear friends. Once more or close the wall with our English dead. Beautiful. Where did you come from? Heaven. You don't like me too much lately, do you? Not too much. Why? If you don't vote for somebody, you don't have to tell him why. Did I do anything to you? Did you do anything for me? What do you mean? What did you ever do for anybody? Like what? In my country, a family could live a year on what they have spent for this thing. "They" don't spend anything for this thing. I paid for this with my own money, which it took me over a year to save up. Big deal. Andy? Thank you. Thank you. That's the first picture they ever took of Rosalind and me together. Where you got this one? Remember when we took it in Rosalind's backyard. Give me my picture back. No, don't. You're going to break it. Come on! Do I need a picture that makes me look so fat for the whole world to see me? You know what I remember about the day we took this picture? You called me in for lunch. And I started running, then I fell down. I started to cry. And you wouldn't even help me get up. You fall down. You pick yourself up. Your compassion is overwhelming. I don't get paid to pick you up. Only to pick up after you. If you got paid more would you have picked me up? You don't even know what it means to do something for somebody, do you? Wait a second. Don't run away. I really want to know. I don't get paid for talking also. (PHONE RINGS) This is a recording. When you hear the tone please leave your name and message and phone number and I will contact you within about three days. ROSALIND: Andy? Rosalind? Can you come right over? It's important. -What? -(LINE DISCONNECTS) Hello! (LAUGHS)... Ros! Hey, Ros! ROSALIND: Andy! I'll be right down. Andy? (SCREAMS) (LAUGHS) How's school? It gives me a headache. All they make you do is study all the time and read things. Who does your homework for you now that I'm not around? Maxine Allerton. Maxine Allerton. Yeah, Maxine. Do you know that she's an idiot? She's not. You know something? I miss not doing your homework for you anymore. How can you miss not doing homework? You're crazy. (SIGHS) Ros... While you've been away I've been going to see an analyst twice a week. -Really? -Yeah. He says that I have a tendency towards being an academite. What's that? It's a person who only gets sexual pleasure out of doing homework. (CHUCKLES) Are you lying or telling the truth? I always lie. (LAUGHING) You see even that was a lie. You never lie. Andy, can I talk to you a minute? What are you doing right now? Seriously. Ah! What should I point at you? My eyes or my ears? Or both? Come on, Andy, I've got a problem. I mean, I don't have a problem. But a friend of mine kind of got into trouble with this man she knew. In the Biblical sense? What's the Bible got to do with it? They're not even the same religion. (CHUCKLES) Will you listen a minute? What's the problem? Well, this friend of mine from school met this guy in Puerto Rico where she went with her family on vacation. Her father's in the junk business so the trip was deductible and this guy... Well, he's really an older man in his twenties. Anyway, you know, they did it. And now she's going to have a baby and she doesn't know where he lives or anything. And even if she did she couldn't get married because she's still in junior high school. And she wants to go on to college, and have fun and pretty clothes like everybody else. So, all we need to do is... You know, to find a man to get rid of it. Go to any hospital. It's legal now. She can't go to a hospital. They'd ask too many questions. And she's Catholic. They'd excommunicate her and her whole family. Hasn't your friend ever heard about the pill? They don't sell them in candy machines, you know. What do you think? She could just go to the family doctor and ask him for the pill? Tell your friend that I don't happen to know where she can find a nice, friendly abortionist. Fine. Thank you. I'll tell her. Ros... If you don't want to help I don't want you to. Okay, come on, stop it. All right? I wouldn't ask you if she had anybody else to go to. Look. Go tell your friend not to worry, all right? I'll take care of it. You will? Okay? How? I don't know. Maybe, I'll go see Doctor Tuttle. God, our pediatrician? He's a doctor, isn't he? He couldn't even take out my tonsils. Hey, will you let me take care of it? You're the best. Is this eye bigger than the other one? What do you mean bigger? This part, from here to here, is bigger than the other one. Your right eye is exactly the same as your left eye and the two of them as a pair go very well together. In fact, you might even say they're beautiful. Thank you. Excuse me. How are you, Mister Katchaturian? Doctor Katchaturian. May I talk to you a minute? C'mon back. Hi, how are you? So talk. I'm doing an experiment for school and I need some pharmaceutical equipment, okay? It's called the Guild 2nd pregnancy test. -For Gonadotropic hormones. -Hmm. This is an experiment for school? It's kind of an extra-curricular activity. Well, it just so happens that I'm one of the few druggists in New York who happens to stock these particular items. But for some strange reason I can only sell them to licensed physicians and other qualified personnel. Not even if it's very important for school? The first place, I find it very difficult to believe that this was anything to do with school. But the other possibility is impossible. Why should I lie to you? If a person wants a pregnancy test the chances are, he made a person pregnant. Oh, that's the most irrational, illogical thing I've ever heard. Did you make a person pregnant? This girl, a friend of mine, she's scared to go to her parents because she missed a couple of periods. Oh my God! I didn't have anything to do with it. I'm not involved. I didn't hear it. I'm filling a prescription in the back. Peter. Don't you believe me? In the first place having a baby is not something you fool around with. If the girl's missed a couple of periods, she's got to go to a doctor. Peter! Don't you understand? If she does that her parents will find out and if her parents find out she'll get killed. And why should she tell her parents if nothing's the matter? That's what I need the test for. It could be kind of a hysterical period missing thing or something like that. It's positively out of the question. -MAN: Merry Christmas. -In the first... -MAN : Merry Christmas. -(BELL DINGS) In the first place, it's against the law. I could lose my license. In the second place I don't want you going around playing doctor. You're too young to play doctor. And you're too old to play doctor. -Suppose you left it out someplace and I stole it? -Oh my God! Can't you act like a human person for a change and do something on human level instead of a pharmaceutical level or a legal level or a God-knows-what kind of a level. Please. Just tell me where it is and I'll steal it and you won't have anything to do with it. Please. I never had this conversation. I don't even know you. I'm filling a prescription in the back. So help me, I'll never forget you, Doctor Katchaturian. Mister, Mister. (MAN SPEAKING ON TV) Daddy? Which do you like? This one or this one? That one. Now... Can I keep them both? Leave your father alone. He's trying to watch the news. Oh, don't go away. Sit down. I'll watch the same stuff at eleven o'clock anyway. Can I, Daddy? -(KATHY YELLING INDISTINCTLY) -Can you what? Keep them both. Hey! Look out! Kathy! Darling! Stop it! Stop it! Why do I have to do my French? School's out. I'm on vacation. Darling, please, leave your daddy alone. He's trying to watch the news. To hell with the news. -Why do I have to do my French? -I don't know. Why does she? Because we want her to use this time to go over what she had in school and get a little bit ahead, that's why, darling. Nobody else has to on vacation. Yes, everybody else has to on vacation. That's what vacations are for, sweetie. -Daddy? -Now come on. -Do what your mother says. -Do I have to? -Yes, you do. Now don't be difficult. -Oh damn. (INDISTINCT) -It's not funny. -It's not. I found out the other day, Karen Morgan's mother let it slip out that Karen has a tutor as well as a governess to help her with her homework every single day. So no wonder she's number one in the class. Don't you have any homework, honey? No. She got terrible marks in math and history and everything. -Is that true? I oughta clobber you. -(LAUGHS) I would, too, if you weren't so pretty. ANDY: Rosalind! I think its Andy. Hi, sweetie. Hi, Mrs. McCarthy. Glad to see you. We never get to see you anymore now that Rosalind's been away. Put it there, Andy boy. -(CHUCKLES) -Ready? -Okay, I'm ready. -Huh? -You sure? -I'm sure. (ANDY GROANING) (LAUGHS)... You cheated. How else do you expect me to win? So you finally decided to come and pay us a visit. I was kinda hoping if Rosalind could come over to my house for a few minutes. -Sure. -Got to show her something. BETTY: But dinner's in half an hour. -Do you promise to be home in half an hour sharp? -Okay. What are we, in the army? Dinner's when we eat it. What the hell is half an hour sharp? If she wants people to treat her like a grown up, she has to start taking a little responsibility and... Okay, okay. She said okay. Wait till she doesn't do something at least before you start bawling her out. Anyway, I trust you, Andy, darling. Even if my baby happens to lose track of time occasionally. -I'll have her back in 15 minutes. -That's good enough for me. If Andy tells you 15 minutes it's going to be 15 minutes. -Right, Andy. -Yes, sir. (CHUCKLES) (MAN SPEAKING ON TV) Do you think it's all right if they go to his house? His parents aren't there. For God sakes. With Andy? Come on. I hate to tell you this, darling but your little baby's got the worst case of the hots I've ever seen in my life. (SIGHS) Leave the kid alone. Did you find somebody? No, but I got a lot of information. I didn't ask you for information, I told you to find a doctor. First we gotta find out if you're pregnant. What do you mean, if I'm pregnant? Okay, your friend. How does she know she's pregnant? She missed her period, stupid. That doesn't necessarily mean she's pregnant. Are you trying to tell me about periods? You didn't even know what one was when I told you. I was ten years old, for God sakes. You said, "I'll find out when I get mine." (LAUGHS) You were a girl. You had to know. You never know anything important. Only junk you read in books. -Oh, I know one thing. -What are you doing? Missing a period doesn't necessarily mean you're pregnant. -Who said so? -The book. Shows how much they know. What are you doing? Will you ever stop eating for a minute? Andy? What are you doing? Okay, Ros, I'm going to ask you to do something for me. -What? -Pee in a bottle. -Very funny. -No. I mean it. What for? The Pregnancy Test. I'm not pregnant, my friend is. Okay. We both know that. But since she's not here and you are you're going to be a good little girl and go into what my family euphemistically calls the powder room and make a nice little pee-pee. Andy, I'm not pregnant. I swear to God. If you're not, the test'll prove you're not. -It's dark in here. -Put the light on. Andrew Morrison, let me out of here. -Hi! -Andy! TELEVISION PRESENTER: This is WX TV channel... What are you doing here? Unfortunately I work here. Don't you have a TV set upstairs in your room? I mean, wouldn't you be more comfortable up... Up there in your pajamas? -I don't wear pajamas. -You know what I mean. I don't have a color TV in my room. We have to do something and... We need a little privacy. What she doing in the bathroom? -An experiment. For school. -(LAUGHING SARCASTICALLY) Would you please let me out of here? Okay. The door's wide open. Come on out if you want to come out. I hate you! Wait a minute. Don't do anything yet. I forgot the bottle. Okay, would you hold it right there, please? Okay hold it. Oh, this is going to be beautiful. Alright hold it now, a little bit to your left please. Hold it. Hold it right there. Would you hold please, I'm trying to get a shot. How am I supposed to do anything in this thing, you idiot. What's wrong with it? It's the only bottle I could find. I'm not an expert, you know, with years of target practice. What! I've never seen anybody so stupid in my whole life. If you don't have a book on bottles to pee in you're lost. I'll be right back. I don't know what you're doing but I know that you're not doing what you want me to think that you are doing. -Look at you can see... -Would you mind filling this up, please? It smells like mayonnaise. -Wash it. -With what? Soap. -Are you finished? -Go to hell. -What's happening? -Nothing. -Would you like a drink of water? -Oh God! Concentrate. I'm trying as hard as I can, but nothing is happening. -Turn on the faucet. -Oh God! -I'll never forgive you for this. -What's happening? -I can't hear you. -What! The water's running. All right, close your eyes and concentrate. Think... Think of the beach and the waves coming in softly. -Splash! Splash! -Shut up. This isn't the only test we could try of course. Like there's one where I look at the inside of your cheek. That's called the Chadwick's test. When you're pregnant it's supposed to be kind of bluish because the inside of your cheek is supposed to be the same color -as the inside of your vagina. -That's disgusting. There's another test, it's called the Goodell's Sign. You reach in and touch the cervix with your finger and if it's soft like your chin that means you're pregnant but if it's hard like the tip of your nose you're not. What's a cervix? Inside the vagina. So that's it. You're putting me through this thing so you can stick your finger in me. Look... Here's the books I got in the library. I'm showing her how to do this chemistry experiment. You leave the door open. I know about them experiments. Now the purpose of this test is to see if there's any gonadatrophic hormone in the urine. If it's positive it will turn one of these purple. But if it's negative it'll turn one of these colors. Looks like you caught a little pregnancy from that friend of yours. I might as well be dead. If my father finds out he'll feel like I stuck a hundred knives in his back. And my mother, if she ever finds out. I might as well be dead. Who's the guy? What? Who's the guy! None of your business. Somebody you met at school? I don't want to talk about it. All right, why don't you get him to help you then? I don't want him to help me, I want you to help me. Who did it? Where'd you meet him? Where'd you do it? I hate you. Did you like it? Did he take your clothes off? I really hate you. Did you let him see you naked? More than I ever hated anybody in my whole life. You drive me crazy. (VEHICLES HONKING) (ENGINES RUNNING) ANDY: What about tomorrow? Can't people get sick on Sunday, too? I'm not trying to argue with you. Okay, Monday. Yes, ma'am. And thank you very much. Thank you. Any special time on Monday? Thank you very much. Yuck! (DOORBELL CHIMES) I'll get it, Modesta. -What the hell do you want? -Sarah and Tomo are across the street. -The maid is still here. -You said she's off today. -She hasn't gone yet. -When's she going? How do I know? When she's ready. Tell her to hurry up for God sakes, 'cause I gotta be home by noon. Will you get the hell out of here. -Who was that? -Nobody. -A friend of mine. -I didn't think it was your enemy. Why do you keep looking at me so funny for? Because I know you're up to something and I don't trust you as far as I can spit. If my own parents can leave me alone for days at a time why can't you go five minutes without treating me like some sort of rape artist or something? That's why they can go. They know I won't let you get away with anything. Like what? Marijuana, and dirty girls and whiskey. Not that I give a damn. A nice little piece of ass might make a man out of you. (SCOFFS) A nice little piece of ass might make a man out of you. Okay. She's gone now. Hey, what's up? -Hey, how you doin'? -Hi! -Give me that hat! Hey! -(GIGGLING) Okay, okay, cool it. (TELEPHONE RINGING) Hello? Hi! Kind of. No. Yeah sure! Nah, it's nothing important. Right. I'll be right over. Okay, bye. I gotta go next door for a few minutes. -But you're coming back, aren't you? -Yeah. -I gotta take a Christmas present over. -Now! They're going away to Acapulco or some place for a couple of days, and they're having some kind of a Christmas party or something. -You know, for the family. -But the only reason I came here because it's your house. I'll be right back. Okay? In a couple of minutes. Honey, please go help your daddy. Would you please? And Mademoiselle, do not forget that Kathy has a date with Karen to go swimming at the club. But on the way you must drop Rosalind at the orthodontist. -Merry Noel. -Thank you, Merry Christmas to you. -Goodbye and have a Merry Christmas. -Goodbye and Merry Christmas. Have a very good day. I really do not see how I am ever going to be ready to leave on time. Why does she have to drop me off someplace like a little kid? Didn't I find you that time in the doorway with the delivery boy from Gristede's? -We were only talking. -What about the time at the swimming pool at the River Club with you and the Puerto Rican pool boy. Were you talking then? -Why do we always have to go through that junk? -Because you asked me a question, darling. And I gave you an answer. She asked me a question. Now will you please get off her back? Oh, hi Andy! How are you? Come on in sweets! It's cold, let's go! Is that for me? We had such a dreadful little Christmas last year in Antigua darling. So we decided to do the whole thing and get it over with before we go to Acapulco this year. -Take the package from Andy, dear. -No, it's too heavy. -Thank Andy for the present. -Thank you! -Merry Christmas, Andy! -I'll find yours here somewhere, darling okay. Put it there, Andy boy. Darling, would you please fix the fire? Oh yea, yea great idea. Nothing like a roaring fire at Christmas. -Can I open my present now? -Not until Daddy finishes the tree. It's finished. -Is that the whole thing? -That's our Christmas tree. That's what you ordered. -Can we open our presents? -Okay. Here we go. What would Santa Claus say about all this. -Hey, thanks a lot Mrs. McCarthy. -Oh you're welcome. -Mr. McCarthy thanks. -Well don't thank me Andy, I have no idea... You paid for it darling! Oh, ho ho ho! God is that adorable, Frank, -look at what Andy gave her! -What is it? Let me show you how it works. -Look at that! -Wow! Isn't that something? That's... -Press those little buttons on the side. -Oh, all of them? Yeah all four of them. Look, look at that! -(FESTIVE MUSIC PLAYS) -How about that! -Andy, how adorable it is. -It's really nice. I kind of... You know, just developed pictures of us together. -Thank you, Andy. -Thank you, Andy. -Thank you for my clock or whatever the hell it is. -No, no. It's a barometer for -your office. And it's from Kathy, so thank Kathy. -Oh, Come here, Kathy. Give your daddy a kiss. Thank Daddy for the blouse. -It's a Liberty print from London. -Thank you daddy! What the hell kind of a present is that? Here. You go get yourself something you really like. Something crazy. Oh my God, is that 2 O'clock? Come on, girls, we're late. Let's go! -Let's get our coats. -What? And I want to thank you very much, darling. For all those wonderful presents you got me. -I'll show them to you later. -Where are you going? Where the hell are you taking everybody? -I'm taking Kathy to Karen's house. Her mother is taking... -What? Them to the museum and then to dinner at La Fonda del Sol. Which hospital? -Where? -Look it up in the phone book. I'm so happy that you could share Christmas with us. Hey, why does it always take you so long to do anything? -Come on, say goodbye to your father. -Okay! -Did you say Monday? -Monday morning, ten o'clock. Call me up tomorrow and remind me. No, I'll call you. She always picks up and listens. Goodbye daddy. Goodbye darling. -Well looks like it's just the two of us! -I better be going Mr.... No comeback here, you wouldn't leave your old pal to drink all alone, would you? Sit down you want the usual, eh? -Merry Christmas there boy, let's clink glasses! -Merry Christmas! Up the old... Down the hatch, come on, come on, here we go. Hey let's get out of here! Let's go outside. Come on, boy! Andy, Andy boy. I want to ask you a... I want to ask you a question and you give me a truthful answer. What do you think about all this? This art here. All these pictures. Does it mean anything to you? Goddammit. Andy, these chairs. Cost me eleven hundred bucks a piece and they're not even comfortable nothing like fresh air, huh? Andy... Andy, come on out here! That brick work, I gotta finish it one of these days. Not now, though. No, not in the winter time. Only morons lay bricks in cold weather. A lot of 'em do it. They don't know any better. Used to be a bricklayer took pride in his work. No more no, no. Now they gotta have a quota. -Nine hundred bricks a day. -Nine hundred? Maybe a thousand. Why the hell should they care? They don't give a damn how they pile 'em on top of one another. Andy, Andy, do you know what makes people not animals? What? We learned how to use bricks. Mr. McCarthy... -I gotta go. -Oh, no, no. You got to stick around one little... One little more. One more come on, come on, (INDISTINCT) Come on, one for the road. You're a good boy, Andy, you know that? -Not too good. -Yes, you are. In the whole world there's not many people I know worth a damn but I know you. You're a good boy. I'll freshen this up for us. I love my kids but I don't know, let's face it. The little one's got a pair of balls like her mother, and Ros, I love Ros. You know how much I love her, but just between you and me, she's got most of her brains in her tits. (BOTH LAUGHING) Don't you tell her I said that. You can't be lucky in everything, I guess. I have been lucky, Andy. Damn lucky. I just happen to be at the right place at the right time. Otherwise, I'd still be laying bricks in some construction gang. Hey, is that the difference? Is that why you turned out to be so great 'cause your father had an education? Andy, Andy... You could wind up being the president of the United States some day. Do you know that? Or you could, you could develop a cure for cancer, or anything. (STUTTERS) You could do it you've got what it takes. I got a lot of faith in you. A lot. You know something, last year I sneaked into your graduation. No, not your graduation, where they give away the prizes, whatever they call it in French. Anyway, I was standing there in the back and when they called out your name for the prize for being number one in your whole class I started to cry. You don't believe that, do you? -No, sir. -It's true. Now don't you tell anybody about that, now you hear? I gotta go, I gotta get my drink. (DOORBELL RINGS) -Hi, Mrs. McCarthy! -Hello sweetie, how are you? Where's your mother? She just left. She should be back in a couple of minutes. You wait here until I pick you up, and no walking around. Okay? -Suppose her mother sends us to the store or something? -As long as it's with Maxine. I'll pick you up at five-thirty. -Bye, Mrs. McCarthy. -Bye, darling. -Hold your head up, you stand like a turtle. -Bye. Hold your head up, you stand like a turtle. It's not funny. She's always saying things like that. You should have heard my mother when she left. She was furious. -At you? -At Rick. -Is he still here? -He's getting dressed, I suppose. What was she mad at him for? She wanted him to do it and he didn't want to. He must do it a lot. They used to, that's how come they sent me to boarding school. Did he ever do it to you? He thinks I'm a goldfish or something. Listen, you want to talk to him before he leaves. I don't know. They just had a fight, I don't think right now is such a good time. You'd better make up your mind. He'll probably leave in a minute. -What should I tell him? -Just tell him. -You tell him. -It's not my baby. -He might get mad. -Why should he get mad? He's the father. Hi. Rosalind. You want to hear something funny? Something really funny happened. You want to know what happened? I gotta tell you something. I gotta tell you something. Come on, please, stop it. Come on, please, stop it. Wait a second, I gotta tell you something. I gotta problem. I don't want your problems, kid. I got all I can handle right now. Did you tell him? -Why didn't you tell him? -Would you leave me alone? -Thirty-nine. -(TELEPHONE RINGING) Thirty-nine. -Thirty-nine. -What's our number? -Forty-one. -Number thirty-nine? Is thirty-nine here? Here. If I'm late for the orthodontist he'll kill me. Go see how long it's going to take. -You go. -Come with me. Over there number three. -Where? -Over there. Excuse me, ma'am? Could you tell me how long it will be before we get to number forty-one? It comes right after number forty. (TELEPHONE RINGING) I'm going to call the orthodontist and tell him I'll be late. -Come with me. -NURSE: I've been down there all this time by myself. I'm not Miss Hospital. VOICE OVER INTERCOMM: Doctor Fursler. Doctor Robinson. (BABIES CRYING) Miss, I don't understand what this bag is for. Were you just given a saline injection? I don't know. They gave me a shot. They took some fluid from your womb and replaced it with a mixture of salt and water. And now all you have to do is go home and wait. For what? To have the miscarriage. At home? We can't very well have you wait here and we don't have enough beds already. I don't want to have no abortion in front of my kids. I got five kids at home. As soon as you feel the contractions, excuse yourself and go in the bathroom. But all I want to know is what is the bag for? All interrupted pregnancies after 16 weeks have to be given legal burial. So you just put the fetus in the bag and bring it back to us and we'll take care of everything. You're going to bury my baby in this bag? I didn't make the laws. Number forty. Here. All those here for maternity we're showing a movie about childbirth. Those of you here for interrupted pregnancy, you don't have to watch -if you don't want to. -There's nothing I can do for you. Number forty-one. Number forty-one. -Right here. -Number one. Excuse me, I didn't hear you. Over there. Number one. Uno. You know how to count? -Come on. -Thank you! Hello. I'm Miss Gibson, your counselor. Won't you please sit down? -Thank you. -What is your name? -Sally. -How are you, Sally? You don't mind if Sally and I talk alone do you? Yes, he does mind. I mean... He minds. All right, Sally. -What is your name? -Marvin. Marvin. Now, the first thing we want to do is to get a little information and then I'm going to give you a little pamphlet on contraception. Now? You don't want this to keep happening over and over again, do you? Excuse me, this woman out there, she had a bag... We'll get to all your questions, I promise you. But first I need a little information. This will help us to help you and other patients in planning our pregnancy interruption service. -How many times including now have you been pregnant? -None. One. -What do you mean one? -She said including now. -How many children do you have? -None. How many children would you like to have? -None. -None! What she means is, don't you ever want to have any babies? -How do I know about ever? I don't even... -Please. Have you tried to get an abortion somewhere else? I tried Castor Oil and a cola douche and eating baked grapefruit and jumping off of things. Yes. Since learning of your pregnancy, have you felt lonely? No. -Unhappy? -No. -Angry? -No. Who or what made you think about getting an abortion? Check one. Mother? Husband? Boyfriend? Other friends? Radio? Television? Newspaper or other? What was the question? How do you figure when a person gets pregnant? -I mean, what day do you start counting from? -Will you shut up. We start counting from the first day of the last period. How could that be? You can't have a period when you're pregnant. Do we have to go through all that junk? The reason I asked is because I read that it's dangerous after twelve weeks. It could be. How dangerous? We have plenty of time for your questions but first we must go at these questionnaires. Who or what made you think about getting an abortion? Check one. Can I just ask you one question? I've got to be somewhere pretty soon, and it's really important so could I just answer some of these questions while I'm getting the abortion? No. -Well, I can get it today... Can't I? -No. I've got to. Today or tomorrow at the latest. You see, I've got to go to Acapulco with my family, the day after tomorrow and after that I've got to go right back to Sch... Work. I work in another town where you can't get abortions. And then I won't be coming back until Easter and by that time I'd be so big everybody would make fun of me and everything. So I've got to get it done today or tomorrow. Don't you understand? We're booked up for several weeks. I'd have to look up the exact schedule. Several weeks! And then, of course, there's a five or six week wait for a bed. Then she'll be over twelve weeks. And you said it's dangerous after twelve weeks. Yes, I'm afraid so. Yes, I'm afraid so. Well, what the hell is this? In order to get an abortion here you... You got to make an appointment before you're pregnant. -Let's get out of here. -It's not going to help the situation to take your hostilities out on me, you know. Number forty-four. -What a dummy! -She wasn't so bad. Not her. You! What'd you bring me here for? -Now I'm going to be late for the orthodontist. -How'd I know? You know all about periods. You're a big expert on periods. Hey, if you're going to holler, I don't even have to help you at all. Thanks a lot. You've really been terrific so far. -Okay. Fine. Do it yourself then. -Fine. Andy. Andy, what are we going to do? How'd you get me into this? What do I have to do with it, anyway? It's your problem. I've got a hundred things I want to do. You think I really love trying to get you a God-damned abortion? You don't have to if you don't want to. Why don't you tell your parents? I swear to God I would rather kill myself. I really mean it. Why? Because they're my parents. You told me you'd find somebody. Okay, I'll try. You can do anything, Andy. I'm glad you think so. I'll be at Doctor Butler's. Then I called up Tony Canby, you know, English Lit. Well, anyway, his brother's a doctor. He calls up his brother and boy, was there ever hell to pay. -His brother thought Tony knocked up the chick. -Oh for Christ's sake! Who is she, anyway? I mean, like if she'd do it with you... -I told you it wasn't me. -Do you think she'll let me do it to her, too? -Come on, Pete, the girl's in trouble. -I don't know. Have you... Have you looked in the underground newspapers? What about 'em? They got ads. They refer you to abortionists. Is it legal and everything? How do I know about legal, for God sakes? All I know is I've seen the ads. Well... -It's worth a try. Thanks, Pete! -Hey, listen, listen, how about fixing me up with her. If she's pregnant already once more isn't going to make it twins, for God sakes. Why don't you go inside and sit down. We're a little busy now, but somebody -will be with you in a minute. Okay? -Thanks. (TELEPHONE RINGING) MAN ON PHONE: We're a private hospital, that's how we avoid red tapes and blades. I'll be with you in just a minute. So why don't you drop by tomorrow? Sure anytime. Bye bye. Sorry, can I help you? I read this ad in the newspaper and I was kinda wondering, umm... You see... I get the message. You want to see Felice. Down in the back there she'll be finished in just a moment. Just wander over. Hi. Hi. Can I help you? -Well... -Why don't you have a seat? You see, I'm trying to help this friend of mine. -She... -She needs an abortion. Yes. Have you tried the public hospitals? Yes, but there's one problem. You see, she has to get it tomorrow and she can't... She can't spend the night over in the hospital. She doesn't want her parents to know. Sure, we can handle it. We only refer people to private hospitals and they don't ask a lot of questions like age, or parents, or things like that. It does cost a little bit more money, though, because we charge a small fee to keep our operation going here. -But we're able to get things done quickly. -Well... -Can you arrange the whole thing? -Don't worry, look, any place we send your friend is going to be legal and safe and everything. And if any problems should happen we can take care of 'em. Why did you eat spare ribs if I told you never to eat spare ribs? -I didn't eat spare ribs. -You bent the wire. -I didn't eat spareribs. -What did you eat then? I can't remember everything I eat. -You, in the next room. -Everything okay? I got an appointment for you tomorrow afternoon. Could you make it in the morning, I'm having my hair trimmed in the afternoon? Stop talking, please. There's one little problem, though. You need five hundred and sixty dollars. What! See what you've done. You bent the wire again. I don't have five hundred and sixty cents. I'm going to have to get your mold. Who's the guy? -I told you, if you ask me one more time. -Goddamn you, for five hundred and sixty dollars, who was the guy who knocked you up? I'm not even going to listen to you if you're going to talk like that. Who was it? Who? None of your business. You want me to get the money for you or don't you? Where are you going to get five hundred and sixty dollars? Never mind where. Who was it? -The guy who lives with Maxine's mother. -What guy? -He lives with her. -How old is he? -I don't know. -Ten? Twenty? -Thirty? Fifty? -A hundred. I don't know why I should waste another minute on you. I really don't. What difference does it make how old he is? Don't you understand? I can't take it anymore. -I've got to see this whole thing in my head. -I don't remember. -All right, find your own doctor. -Andy! He's about twenty-five. -Where'd you do it? -Maxine's house. -Where? -Why should you care what I did? You're not interested in me like that. Like what? You never even tried to kiss me. Not once, in your whole life. -Don't you realize that... -You in the other room. I'm just here to see Rosalind a minute. So she can bite my fingers off again, and bend the wires? You really give me problems. Were you naked? Did he take your clothes off? -Did he? -Yes. -Was he? -Yes. -Did you like it? -No! -The truth. -I hated it. -The truth! -It hurts. -You, in the other room. -Okay. -Andy? -What? Are you going to get it? I don't know. Sir? Could you tell me if Maxine Allerton is upstairs? -She's walking down there. -Thank you very much. Maxine! Maxine! -What? -Could you come here a minute? What? Come here a minute! Oh, okay! Hi, what's the matter? -Could you do me a favor? -Yeah. Remember that guy who lives with you? Could you tell me if he's here or out someplace? He should be leaving any minute now to go to the gym, if he hasn't already gone. Okay, just stay with me and point him out if he comes out? If he doesn't come out in five minutes he's already gone. -Want a piece of candy? -Yeah, thanks. Are you going to help her get rid of it? I found the place but I need a lot of money. You're going to ask him for money? -I'm not going to ask him. I'm going to tell him. -Lots of luck. -There he is. -Hurry up. Excuse me, sir, could I talk to you a minute? Could I talk to you a minute about Rosalind? -Who's Rosalind? -Maxine's friend. What about her? -She's going to have a baby. -I didn't know that. I thought you ought to know. She needs some help in raising the money. For the abortion. And you know since you and her were... You got chocolate on your face, sonny. -What did he say to you? -Nothing. -I saw him say something. -Nothing. I told you. Goddammit! (GRUNTING) Shit! -Andy! What happened to you? -Nothing! Okay, nothing happened. -I need five hundred and sixty dollars. -Who doesn't. I don't know where to go. I don't know what to do anymore. -You need the money for yourself? -No. For who? I can't tell you. But I started something and I got to finish it. Even though I hate her. I really hate her. I just can't stand her anymore! I hate her! -How much money you say you needed? -Nothing. I don't need anything anymore. To hell with her. Let her solve her own Goddamn problem. I don't even like her anymore. Anyone can help a person he likes. What do you mean? If you can help a person just because he needs it whether you like him or not, that's helping a person. Two hundred and forty-five dollars. I can't take that from you. That's the best news I heard all day but in case you change your mind... I promised them we'd be able to finish on time. Are you trying to tell me we're not going to make it? Yeah, with overtime. Mr. McCarthy? Andy, what the heck are you doing here? I called your office and they told me that I might find you here. -What happened to your face? -Umm... -Could I talk to you for a minute? -Sure, come on, sit down. Well... What's your problem? I need some money. Well that's no problem. How much? 315 dollars. -Check okay? -No. I don't think so. Hey, Shark! You... You don't have to tell me what you need it for if you don't want to. I don't think I can. That's okay. Here, have the paymaster cash this for me. You sure you don't want to talk to me about this? Andy? -This friend of mine got into some trouble. -What kind of trouble? Well... It's a girl and she needs an abortion. You mean you... You little son of a b... Andy... (LAUGHING) Andy, why didn't you come to me? Talk to me before you... I could of... Who is she? Who's the girl? -Who is she? -I can't tell you. -She, she isn't... -Do you think I'm the one responsible? -Do you? You think that I... -Shut up, shut up, shut up. Where'd you get the doctor? I went to this place and they called him up for me. -You mean you don't know a damn thing about him? -No. (DIALING THE TELEPHONE) Hello Judy, Frank, listen. You remember that doctor that you went to a couple of years ago when you... Yeah... What kind of a doctor was he. Was he good? Clean? Give me his name, huh? His phone number. You got that? No. No. It's nothing like that, now come on, stop it... Give it to me. Four-five-nine-two. I've been busy the last couple of days. I'll call you tomorrow. Here, take her to this guy. I know he's okay. You'll need some more dough. Here's five hundred. Listen, don't you come over to the house anymore. (DOORBELL BUZZES) -Mister and Mrs. Arthur? -Doctor Hargrave? Come in, please. You go in there. Have a chair. So you're Mister Arthur. I believe you said, Mister Sidney Arthur? -Yes, Sir. -Uh-huh. -I suppose they call you Sid. -Yes, Sir. I enjoyed reading the book about you. What book? Siddhartha. I've read Hermann Hesse novels, too. -I'm sorry, I'm... -HARGRAVE: Oh, please, please. In my profession I enjoy a bit of whimsy. I'm Andrew Elliot Morrison. You understand it's against the law for a doctor to perform an abortion in his office. Yes, Sir. I suppose you have valid reasons for not going to a hospital. -ANDY: Yes, Sir. -All right. Let's go in there, shall we. And you can wait here. Mrs. Morrison, would you please go in there and take off all your clothes. You can put that thing on hanging up there on the hook. Why do I need to take all my clothes off? I think before we go through all this we ought to make sure you really need it first. -Don't you? -I wouldn't be here if I didn't need it. -Have you had a pelvic? -ROSALIND: What's that? I'm going to examine you to see if you really are pregnant. All right? And if so, how far along you are. ROSALIND: Then what happens? -We perform a little surgery. -ROSALIND: Does it hurt? Not a bit. It only takes a couple of minutes, but you'll probably want to rest for a while afterwards. When they took my tonsils out they kept me overnight. Are you disappointed, for God sakes? She's disappointed. -Can my friend stay with me while you do it? -No. -Andy! -What's the matter? I hate shots. They hurt, I can't stand pain. People can die from too much pain. Once when I was in the dentist office I fainted before he ever touched me. Don't you understand? Ow! What'd you give me? Just a tranquilizer to relax you. I just want you to know, both of you that I don't like any of this at all. Mrs. Morrison, will you please lie down, put your feet in the stirrups and slide down to this end of the table. And will you wait outside, please? Don't you want the money now? That's a lot of money for a young boy. Put it in my coat pocket over there. Will you wait outside, please? -Please let him stay. -Don't worry. It'll be over in a couple of minutes. He won't hurt anything. Please. Why do you want to make it difficult for him, too? Isn't it bad enough that you and I have to go through it? Why shouldn't he go through it, too. He's my friend. All right. Take your jacket off. Wash up over there carefully, while I do the pelvic. -Should I wash my face, too? -HARGRAVE: Not unless you want to. You'll find a gown in the lower drawer. -This? -HARGRAVE: Put it on. HARGRAVE: Everything's disposable nowadays. Andy, hurry up. Come here. What's he doing now? I would say you were in your eighth or ninth week, which is very good so far. What are you doing? Just preparing a local anesthetic. It won't hurt. -I told you, I hate shots. -Come on, cut it out. Ow! You lied. It hurts. -You trying to feel my boobs, for God sakes! -Well, you put my hand there. HARGRAVE: Now just try and relax now, please. Wait a minute, stop! Let me off of this thing. -HARGRAVE: What's wrong? -I gotta go to the bathroom. That's normal. Please, something terrible. I really have to, please. Ow! Help me. Make him stop, somebody. ROSALIND: Ow! Help me. That's all the pain you're going to feel. You don't have to choke me to death. It's bad enough with him down there without you trying to kill me at this end, too. You promise not to scream? How would you like to be spread out here like a wishbone with somebody... Actually the position you're in is called hysterical position, coming from the same root as hysterectomy. Ow! Make him stop. Tell him my father's a policeman. You're almost finished. Why did I think that bastard Rick was so cute? He should have known I wasn't on the pill or anything. ROSALIND: He's a mean, selfish bastard. We're all through. You mean I'm all through? A dead person? You can take that thing off and put it in the basket here. Disposable. -Should I see it? -Nothing to see. -Is it a boy or a girl? -A tadpole. Come in to the office. You can lay there as long as you like. Well, I must say, you're an unusual man, Mister Andrew Morrison. She didn't cry. She didn't even cry. Most women, I find, hold up much better than men under pain. I know. Sometimes you really can't tell about people. No, you really can't. -Are you mad at me? -No. What are you acting so funny for? -I was just thinking. -About what? -ANDY: You really want to hear it? -ROSALIND: Sure. ANDY: (LAUGHS) You don't want to hear it. No, I do, really. I never thought about it before. But no one ever counted on me for anything before. Not really, you know, for anything that matters. My bottom feels like I went through a cement mixer. What did you ask for if you're not going to listen? Tell me again, I'll listen. I don't think I'm going to be able to pay the money back. I don't get too much allowance, and I got to buy new coats and things when my parents say the styles are too crazy. That would mean I would have to go forever without anything to wear. ROSALIND: But I'll pay you back for all the trouble and everything somehow. -You've already paid me back. -ROSALIND: How? By teaching me a lot of things. That's not good enough. Don't you understand? I gotta pay you back exactly what I owe you or else we can't be friends. You know what? I apologize to you. I really do. For what? Well, up till the other day I put you too high. You know, like on a pedestal. And then I got mad and I put you too low. But who am I to put you anyplace? You are what you are. (LAUGHS) I'm sorry, but you look so funny when you get so serious. -ANDY: That's okay. -ROSALIND: What were you going to say? Nothing. What were you going to tell me? It's exactly like I read in this book on Zen. I used to think that a mountain was a mountain and a stream was a stream. And then I learned that a mountain is not a mountain, and a stream is not a stream. But then I found the secret. I realized that a mountain is a mountain, and a stream is a stream. You want to do it to me, don't you? You really want to do it to me. That's how come you're acting so funny, right? You can, anytime you want to, okay? Okay? I love you, Rosalind. Andy.
