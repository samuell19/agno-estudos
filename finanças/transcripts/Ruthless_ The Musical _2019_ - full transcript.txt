Good evening, (slow paced music) my name is Sylvia St. Croix. Where does talent come from? Is it a product of one's environment? Something you pick up off of the street? Or is talent something you're born with? Something passed down from generation to generation? ♪ I wonder ♪ Meet Judy Denmark. (light upbeat music) Pretty, isn't she? (audience laughing) A wife and mother living an idyllic suburban life, and, although Judy has absolutely no talent whatsoever, her only child, her daughter, Tina, has been blessed with a great deal of talent.

Thank you, Mike Lerman! Also, Betty Lerman and all the gals at Betty's Needle Nook for making our costumes, thanks Betty. And now, boys and girls, the starring role of Pippi Longstocking will be played by Miss Louise Lerman! (piano solo) - Are you fucking kidding me? (school bell) (audience laughing) (upbeat music) - You had your heart set on playing Pippi, didn't you? - It's the title role! - Oh Tina. - It's the best part in the show. - Sweetheart... - I don't understand! That Lerman girl was too Jewish-looking to play Pippi! - Tina! - She has no fire! No music! - Oh, so what if Louise Lerman is playing Pippi, you get to play Puddles! - Puddles! - I don't wanna play a dog! - Puddles doesn't sing! Puddles doesn't even talk! Puddles is a stupid mime part. - I hate mime. - Everyone does. - I mean, just look at me. I was born to play Pippi Longstocking! And Louise Lerman can't act! - Oh! Now you listen to me, young lady, do you want to stay in show business? - You're right, Mother. I only wanted that silly old part so you and daddy would be proud of me. - But we are proud of you, baby. Of course, if you had gotten the part, we would have been real, real proud, but nevertheless. - Oh, mother, what would you give me for a bucket of kisses? - Why, I'd give you a tub of hugs. (doorbell rings) - I'll get it. (upbeat music) - Oh! Good afternoon, Tina. - Why, good afternoon, Miss Thorn. - You're looking very pretty today! - Why, thank you, Miss Thorn! - Now that was an excellent curtsy! - Why, thank you, Miss Thorn. - Oh, she is so polite. - Why, thank you, Miss Thorn. - I see where she gets it from. - Why, thank you, Miss Thorn. (Thorne laughing) - Haven't changed your mind, have you? - I'm afraid not. - Come on, Sylvia! - Won't you sit down? - No thank you. Drink! - Excuse me, Miss Thorn, who do I speak to about comps? - I beg your pardon? - Free tickets? - I'm afraid the Turner school never gives away free tickets. - I see. - All the money of course will go to the school fund. - I bet the Lerman kid gets comps. (door slams) - Miss Thorn... - I know what you're thinking, Mrs. Denmark, and I am not a lesbian. (audience laughing) - But you were an actress once, before you started teaching? - Oh yes my dear, but that was ages ago. - Tell me. Was there ever a part you wanted but you didn't get? - Once or twice, what's your point? - Tina is awfully upset about not playing Pippi. - I must admit, Mrs. Denmark, in all my years as an actress, and I've lived on both coasts. I've never known anyone to want a part so desperately.

(audience applauding) Let me sum it up for you in two words. That's show business. - That's three words. - My dear Miss Thorn, might you consider letting Tina be the Lerman girl's understudy? - What's an understudy? - An understudy is someone who plays the part if the star can't go on. - We are only giving one performance. I think having an understudy is unnecessary, but if it will make you happy, then yes, Tina can be Louise Lerman's understudy. - Wait a minute! You want me to learn all of Pippi's songs, all of Pippi's dances, and all of Pippi's lines, and there's a chance I won't even get to play Pippi? (Thorne laughs) - That's right! - Unless, of course, something were to happen to Louise Lerman. (tense whimsical music) - I'll do it! (perky music) - A five, six, seven, eight! A turn, turn, (speaking foreign language) go! (clock winding) Pay attention. A one, two, three go! (girl tapping) You see, Tina please, come on. Perfect. Thank you girls, rehearsal over. - That was a delicious lunch, dear. Thanks for inviting me. - Well, you've been here since breakfast. - Oh, Judy, you must be so proud of Tina. I wish I had a daughter. - I thought you said you do have... - A talented one! (audience laughing) - Would you like to talk about it? - Well, what is there to say?

Two wonderful people raised me. - Are they at all gifted? - Well Dad was a salesman. And mother? Well, my mother hates anything to do with theater. She's a theater critic. (dramatic chiming) - Lita Encore. - You've heard of her? - Why, she's legendary! Why, your mother's closed 100's of shows, thousands! - Well she's coming to see Tina's show tonight. (dramatic chiming) - How exciting. I must ask her to autograph a copy of her book, "Ruthless: The Life and Times of Ruth Del Marco." (dramatic chiming) - That name. - Ruth Del Marco? (dramatic chiming) What's the matter, dear? - Del Marco. - Ruth Del Marco was a great entertainer in her day. Why, her recording of "I'll Be An Unkie's Muncle" was a tremendous hit. Your mother wrote a book about her. - Well what's become of this, this... - Ruth Del Marco? (dramatic chiming) She's dead. After a scathing review closed her show, she couldn't go on. So she took her own life. - Well, I feel sorry for her and everyone like her, because show people are doomed. Doomed to a lifestyle of booze, pills, and heavy meals late at night. - But that's show business. (audience laughing) - That's not the life I want for my child.

The name of the child is being withheld until the parents have been notified. We now return you to your regularly scheduled program. - Sylvia! - It was not Tina!

Needless to say we're all very shaken up over this tragedy, Lord knows I'm trying. - We can all be at times. (audience laughs) - I'm happy to say that Turner School is creating a benefit in Louise's honor. All the money raised will go to purchase a memorial. Fruit and cheese basket for the Lerman Family. - Oh how thoughtful. Fruit and cheese is so comforting. - Well, one does what one can. - Of course, the show has been canceled. - What ever gives you that idea? - Well, naturally, I thought... - I couldn't possibly disappoint the other children. They've worked so hard and they're so eager to perform. - Oh yes, but I think... - I think it is an excellent opportunity to learn that the show must go on! By the way, how's Tina? - Oh, she's in her room. - Running her lines? - I beg your pardon? - Well, she is the understudy. - I know, but... - I have worked very hard on this production, Mrs. Denmark, and I think it's good. Maybe the best work I've ever done! - But it's wrong! It's shockingly wrong! - Now listen to me Mrs. D! I've enough trouble with the Pippi people over the damn rights! They are not gonna stop me and neither are you! Okay, so, maybe I have to change the kid's name, but mark my words, Pippi, Schmippy, that talented little girl of yours had better be in make-up, in costume, and in place by show time, or I shall be forced to call the police! (dramatic music) - The police? - I didn't want to have to bring this up, but it appears that the Pippi wig is missing. - Why are you telling me this? - Because according to one of our other students, little Rachael Hobbs, Tina was seen chasing Louise and snatching at the wig. - Are you saying you suspect that Tina... - I suspect nothing, nothing at all. The children were just playing a game, they got a little over-excited, one of them got killed. No, I suspect nothing. (audience laughing) - Why don't you come out and say it?

Now, what are you doing with Louise Lerman's Pippi wig? - I found it after Louise had her accident. - If that's true, Tina, then why didn't you give the wig to Miss Thorn? - Because I was afraid! Afraid Miss Thorne would think I was naughty! - Were you naughty, Tina? - Oh, no, Mommy. I wasn't naughty. After Louise had her accident, I found the wig and put it in my bag so it wouldn't get lost. I'm sorry, Mommy. Did I do a bad thing? - Oh no, Tina, no. But we do have to give the wig back to Miss Thorn. - Oh, mother, you're silly. She's too old to play Pippi. - Tina! - It's my wig and it's my part! - Sweetheart, is there something you want to tell Mommy? - Only that I love you and I think that you're the best mother in the whole, wide world. That's what I tell everyone. I say, I have the nicest mother! The prettiest mother! Oh, Mother, what would you give me for a bucket of kisses? (Tina smooches) - Knock it off, Tina! You're not that good! (dramatic music) - Excuse me? - You did it, didn't you? - What do you mean, mother? - You killed Louise Lerman for a part in a show? - Not just any part Mother, the lead! - Oh, my God! Well start at the beginning and don't leave anything out! ♪ Howdy-Do, my name is Pippi ♪ - Not the show, Tina! Tell me what happened to Louise! - We got to rehearsal. - Go on. - We changed clothes. - Go on. - We did warm-ups. - Go on. - Louise hung herself. - Back up. (audience laughing) - I told Louise I had to play Pippi, but she said I didn't have the range. So I chased her. I chased her up onto the catwalk. That's when she gave me the wig. I asked her if that meant if I could play Pippi and she said, "Yeah, over my dead body!" So I wrapped the jump rope around her fat neck and pushed her over the side! - Tina! (dramatic music) Tina! - I wanted the part, what could I do? (audience laughing) - You could have hurt her! You didn't have to kill her! - I wasn't thinking. I was tired and I didn't have my lunch. - Look at me, Tina! You did a bad thing, a very bad thing! You killed that little girl, do you know what that means? - Yeah, it means I'm playing Pippi! - Go to your room! - Why? - You're punished! - But, Mommy, the show! - Never mind the show! - Now go to your room and don't you come out until I call you!

What did she do? Kill Somebody? (Lita laughing) Hello? (dramatic chiming) - Mother, this is Tina's manager, Sylvia St. Croix. - Here! Don't I know you from somewhere? - I replaced Monica Breedlove in "Surely, You Jest." (Lita gasps) - Of course! The role of Shirley was played by an actress whose performance obviously peaked with the cab driver on the way to the theater. - Grandmother! - Darling! Have you been naughty? - Have you? - I love this kid. - How much? - This much! - More! - This much! - More! (audience laughing) - Here! - Look, Sylvia. - Mine are in the car, and they're bigger. - Here. - Tina, I want you to go back to your room. - Oh! - You can visit with Grandmother later. - Come along, Tina. We better work on the Pippi ballad. - That's the slow song. - Oh, darling, I remember you when you were this big. - I remember you when you were sober! (audience laughing) - Would you like a drink? - Are you going to have one? - Oh, yes, yes, indeed. - Now, what's all this twaddle about my granddaughter being punished? - Mother, you know how Frederick and I have always... - Who? - Frederick, my husband? We've always encouraged Tina to do whatever she wants, and all she's ever wanted was to perform. - You're married? - The point is, I don't want Tina to ever set foot on a stage again, ever! And that goes for tonight. - Well darling, if you think I've driven all this way to sit through some farchadet Pippi musical that does not star my granddaughter, you're out of your mind. - But, Mother... - Honey. ♪ If I want to see theater ♪ ♪ I go see a play ♪ ♪ With no singing or dancing ♪ ♪ To get in the way ♪ ♪ Theater is language ♪ ♪ And that should be all ♪ ♪ Music belongs at the Carnegie Hall ♪ ♪ Not a reason on earth ♪ ♪ As far as I know ♪ ♪ To write, mount, and open ♪ ♪ A musical show ♪ Honey, I've been a theater (fast upbeat music) critic for 100 years and it's always the same. ♪ The story is moving ♪ ♪ Chock full of suspense ♪ ♪ The plot takes a twist ♪ ♪ And the mood is intense ♪ ♪ Then someone sings a song like this ♪ ♪ It doesn't make sense ♪ (audience laughing) ♪ Puh-Leeze ♪ ♪ I hate musicals ♪ ♪ Gangs don't look tough ♪ ♪ When they twirl and they snap ♪ ♪ My blood starts to boil ♪ ♪ When a nun starts to tap ♪ ♪ And wouldn't you just love to slap ♪ ♪ Maria Von Trapp ♪ I'll tell you how to solve a problem like Maria.

They may do a mother-daughter spread. - It's a school show, Sylvia. - It's the start of her career. - Well, I'm not sure I want her to have such a career! - I'm not sure you have a choice. Show business is in that child's blood. - Don't say that! It's not in my blood or in Frederick's. - Who? - I've made up my mind. No more show business! - What about what Tina wants? - Well Tina will be happier in the Brownies. - No! She'll die in the Brownies! - Stop it, Sylvia! (light music) - I think you do want this for Tina, but you're afraid. - Afraid? - Afraid of how desperately you want it, and not for Tina, but for yourself! - What are you saying? - Admit it! Deep down it's you who wants to be the star! - What? - Everyone does! - No! (audience laughing) - You're jealous of your own daughter's talent! - I am deliriously happy leading a normal, ordinary life! And so too will my daughter. - A normal life was not possible, nor is it for any poor creature driven by inherited talent. I'm quoting you, Miss Encore. It's a passage from a book you wrote many years ago. "Ruthless: The Life and Times of Ruth Del Marco." (dramatic chiming) - That name! - Ruth Del Marco was insane! Talented, somewhat, but totally insane. Imagine killing yourself over a bad review. - A review written by Lita Encore! - What of it? - If only you'd been (slow jazz music) a little kinder, a little more encouraging with your words, Ruth Del Marco might still be alive. - Perhaps she is. (dramatic chiming) - What? - They never found her body, just those big footprints in the sand and a suicide note. - Surely you don't believe... - Three years ago, Ruth Del Marco was spotted doing "I Do, I Do" in Bucks County! - That's just a rumor. - Perhaps, but the fact is they never found her. - Or her child. (dramatic chiming) - A child? - Ready for lunch, sweetheart? - Ruth Del Marco had a child? - A little girl, I believe. (dramatic chiming) - Sylvia! (dramatic chiming) - Coming, Tina. (slow paced music) She kept it quiet, of course. The child's father being Bob Fosse and all. (audience laughing) (Lita gasps) (audience applauding) - Oh, I want my child to be happy! - She is happy. - I want her to be normal. - She is happy. (audience laughing) - Mother? - Yes, honey? - Who am I? - Why now, you're my daughter and I love you very much. - Well yes, yes, but where do I come from? - The Judy department at Sears! - Oh Mother, please! You've got to tell me the truth! Who are my real parents? - Oh, please, Ginger. - Ginger? - I mean Judy! - You called me Ginger! - I knew God would punish me for panning Fiddler. (chimes chiming) Oh this is so difficult for me! Come, let's go have a quiet lunch, just the two of us, and afterwards a long talk. Please? We need time. - Of course, Mother. I understand. - Ah, you're Ruth Del Marco's child! - Oh, my God! - You tore it out of me! - Do you mean to say I came from that, that... - Oh, I know what you're thinking and it's not true! - I'm talented! - No! - Oh God help me, I'm talented! - Darling, you're not! Trust me! - Oh, it's all my fault! - What are you talking about? - Her talent, her drive, her pathological need to be famous! Oh God! Oh I feel so cheap and dirty! How did this happen? (melancholy music) - I heard Ruth had a child. And when she disappeared, I came looking and I found you alone, frightened, locked up in your mother's dressing room! Oh, Judy. - No! My name is Ginger Del Marco! (dramatic chiming) (Lita gasps) - But you're my daughter and I have raised you ever since you were two years old. - Oh, mother. - Okay, seven, what's the difference? You were an ordinary little girl who couldn't sing or dance at all. - Was I, Mother? Was I? - You're still nothing special. - How can you be sure? - 'Cause you've grown up beautifully and you're married to Kenneth. - Frederick! - Whatever!

(audience applauding) - How could you do this to your only child? - The same way my Mother did it to me. - Something I'm sure she's regretted every day of her life. Hello, Tina. - All that woman cared about was her career. I can't say that I blame her. - Your mother is so proud of you. - My mother is dead. - Am I? (tense music) - The critics tried to kill me, but I'm still here! - I don't understand, Sylvia. - No, my child, not Sylvia, the name's Del Marco! (dramatic music) (Ginger gasps) Ruth Del Marco! - Mama? Mama? - After Lita's poisonous review closed my show, I couldn't face anyone! Not even my own child. So I swam far, far out to sea, but, as luck would have it, I was rescued by a passing cruise ship. Fortunately, they didn't recognize me with wet hair. One night I changed my name and sang a couple of songs in the Lido Lounge. Soon I was headlining, and calling bingo, in the main room! They loved me! - They'll love anything on a cruise ship! - Watch it! (audience laughing) One day a producer came aboard and offered me a part in an all-white company of the all-black version of, "Hello Dolly!" I jumped at it. One summer we played your small town and that's when I spotted you. All those years of pushing you aside, thinking only of myself, never encouraging you to develop the talent you were born with. I should have given you voice lessons, or at least tap shoes that fit. (audience laughing) I just didn't want to share the spotlight. - Oh, mother I... - I still don't! - Sorry! (audience laughing) - Suddenly, it didn't matter. For there, standing next to you, was my granddaughter, Tina! And I knew that God had given me a second chance! Can you ever forgive a silly, selfish, old woman? - Oh Mother, you're not silly. But, but why do you insist on making Tina a star? - I can't let you make the same mistakes with your daughter. You'll never forgive yourself. - I forgive you Mama. - Gingie? - Hold me, Mommy! - Baby! (light dramatic music) - Grandmother! - Call me Ruth! (fast upbeat music) - But why didn't you tell me any of this before? - I didn't want you to think I was hanging around to get a part in one of your shows because I'm your Mother, or anything. - You are going to be in my new show! (Sylvia chuckles) - That's very sweet dear, but the truth is I don't want to perform anymore. What I really wanna do is direct! - Then you'll direct it! - What about me? - She'll be great in the part of your daughter. - Sorry to disappoint you, Tina, but the part's been cast. Cute kid, too. Rachel somebody. - Does she need an understudy? - Here we go again! (audience laughing) - I want that part! - You're not ready for it. Oh sure, you got rid of the competition once, but do have you any idea how many people you have to destroy to make it in this business? - I can learn. Teach me!

Come on. - You just run along and have a good time. Don't worry about the show, I can do it! - Take off my dress. - I thought you gave it to me. - To take to the cleaner's, Einstein, not to wear. - Did I mention I'm taking the afternoon off? - You're not serious. ♪ I have rehearsal. ♪ - Oh, you're joking. - I'm your new understudy! - You're fired! - You can't fire me because I quit!

The name is not Eve! It's Lerman. (dramatic music) Betty Lerman! (dramatic music) - Who? - Louise's mother! Act One! (audience laughing) - Oh, the dead girl. (everyone screaming) - I have waited a long time for this. And look at you. Standing there, thinking you're better than everyone else (everyone screaming) just 'cause you've got talent. - We are better than everyone else. - Stop it, Mother! - Tina! - Do you hear yourself? It's only talent. - But, darling, talent made me a star! - Talent isn't a bad thing. It's when the rewards of talent, when fame and fortune become so important you forget who you are and what you did for love. Sure, I got talent, but I did a terrible thing. I know I can't bring Louise back, but I've learned something. I've learned there's more to life than being a star. Thank you, and God bless you all! (audience laughing) - That's one smart girl you got there! - Thanks, Betty. Can I call you Betty? - Well... Well sure, kid. - Now! (Betty screams) (fast tense music) (gun firing) (Betty gasps) - It's me! - Don't get blood on my sofa! (Eve speaking foreign language) (dramatic music) (audience applauding) - Tina... - Oh! (gun firing) (audience laughing) - You saved my life. - Now can I be in your show? (Ginger and Sylvia screaming) - No, Tina! Not this way! - Back off, Granny, I've killed before! (Sylvia screams) - You wouldn't hurt Mommy, would you? - Oh, so it's back to Mommy, is it? - Where's my granddaughter? (Lita screaming) - Do it! Tina, give me the gun!
