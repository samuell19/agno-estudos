Who will take this safely to Hyderabad? There's a man for it. I can dig a tunnel with my eyes. I can swim across a sea with cycle tube. But will not do what you're asked to do, right? I will no. He's just sound box. He only talks, actual work is done by him. He? He looks very tender. Am I vegetable to be tender? He's hot chilly. If cut chilly is shoved, you'll be on fire. Stop this vegetable business. It's not easy to take material to Hyderabad. 30 check posts, 300 policemen are waiting to book you.

He won't listen, take out your phone. This must become breaking news on every news channel. Every newspaper must carry your photo. Buddy, action! I'm Nani, I'm driver of this ambulance. Zoom on ambulance, boy. Focus on me now. Patient fighting for life, heartless police stopped ambulance. watch after break... - You move. My name is Nagaraju. I'm a police constable.

I suspect trouble, let me offer prayers to my Swamiji. Protector of the distressed and destitute! Take us to the right path in this route, lord. Lord, ensure our tyres don't go flat. Even if tyres are flat make sure we don't hit some tree. What a dirty mouth! Who the hell is your God? This man? Swami Nithyananda. - Is he your God? Don't call him names, you may lose eyes. I can't bear a bad word about my God, my family deity. I'll hit you, rascal! Get down from vehicle. Don't push me, Swami Nithyananda will show us a way. Buddy, I can't repair this tyre alone.

This is only good you've done till now. - Thanks, buddy. Let's go after finishing the drink, buddy. My love...come... Buddy, be stable like me after having drinks. Buddy, this world thinks bad about a drunkard not falling flat. Forgive me, don't disturb me. Giri, get up. It's wrong to leave an innocent boy like me alone in this dense forest. Bloody fool! I'll take you to task tomorrow. Is there anyone to give me company? Once...twice...third time... Somebody is there! Oh my gosh! What a beauty! God! Hats off! Who ordered to make this beauty! But what's the use? Made such a beautiful statue! Had you filled life into it and given it to me, Wouldn't I make my heart her abode? Look at those eyes! I can live all my life by just watching those eyes! Your lips...chips made from milk cream! Good show, you're great! Look at the waist! Like moon bitten on both sides! Why is it so soft and tender? Oh no, I'm going crazy! O God! If such had been i my life, I wouldn't allow dust to touch her feet. Heard me? I wouldn't allow dust to touch her feet. Competitor of Venus...celestial beauty...

I entered forest to escape from police, but had a flat tyre, sir. Parcel is safe, right? You've given the job to me, I'll die but parcel will be safe. Okay, come quickly. Buddy, parcel is missing.

Looks like she too as missed the path like us. Where do you want to go? Highway? Let's take her, buddy. I'll hit you with slippers. Aren't we already in neck deep trouble?

From which place? - Amaravathi. We came from Amaravathi, right? Where in Hyderabad? Do you know anyone here? I know. - Who? You both! Are you wearing slippers or shoes, buddy? If I wore slippers, I would've hit you there for giving her lift. Sister, I'm already tensed, please get down. Why are you begging her? Get down I say! Do you've money? Give her something and drop her here. Pack some statue similar to it and manage them. Buddy! God of Telugu people is alive in the form a statue! Shall we pack and deliver it? NTR? - Yes, buddy.

If stands like a tree blocking wind from North-West direction. How can idol come inside? Clear out, you fools. Why are you standing like a Delhi bull on North East direction. What's this big belly? Chicken and mutton biryanis! Go, stand in South-West direction. Go....stop! Pick up that bag....go... Go to that corner. Carry bag on head. Idol will not come here till South-West is heavy. It's same weight if I keep here and sit on it, Shastri. Keep it here and sleep on it, it'll be very comfortable. If you don't follow my orders, you'll be reduced to ashes in minutes. Stand still! - Idol is here, brother. Didn't know your words have so much fire? Idol is here. I'm genius. Idol... Why did you take so much time? We went to Dilsukhnagar for idol. We didn't go for idol to Dilsukhnagar, we went with it. To offer prayers on your name. - Dilsukhnagar? Where's the offering? - They gave a coconut. We didn't know you'd ask, we offered it to a monkey. Monkey? You brought it here without checking the parcel. Keep it there. Go, get things to offer prayers. - What's that mountain on mountain? Take it, Guru. They're opening the door, they're offering prayers. If they find it is fake, they'll smash us both along with it. Take it. - Take it, sir? What? Rs.2 crore project? Inauspicious time has started, sir. Is it inauspicious time? Can I open it, Shastri? If you do anything in inauspicious time, you'll get ruined, sir. How can you do it? Like this. - Inauspicious time. You mustn't use rugs in summer. Mustn't use AC in winter. Likewise don't do anything during inauspicious time. What would happen if do? - You'd get ruined! When should I open it then? Don't open it till I find an auspicious day and time for it. No risks in expensive matter. - No...no... Payment...? - No problem, you can pay. Not to you but to them. Take the cheque. Take your cheque for Rs.1 lakh. Deposit immediately. After the sale of idol. That idol won't get sold and this cheque can't be encashed. No use. Looks like the girl's nose pin! He's studying it so much, may it is not gold. I'll be happy if he pays for at least one beer. Don't know what he would offer? Buddy, be careful. Get down. Come, buddy. Girls come here to freak out... Stop...stop... How many jewels! Lone girl! She's like my sister. This city is too bad. What if someone harms her in this city? - What if they harm? We're enjoying these drinks because of her, right? Don't you've that sentiment also? Stop your bloody emotions and loose motions. I don't have any such sentiments. Wow! How nice it is! These city lights and building heights! You're more beautiful than that. Your eyes, your body. You too are handsome. Tattoo on hand, ring on ear, curly hair. Do you know we are? Do you know why did we bring you here? Why? - To rape you. Is it? I don't see any festivities here. Is it public function for festivities? Aren't you afraid of us? - No. I mean why not? If I say rape, you must shout, shriek and create a scene. I'm shouting here, she's sitting coolly there. May be she belongs to She-Team in disguise. Police are very alert after Telangana Govt. came. I'm confused with this scene, why are you scaring me with police? Are you Police? - No. Who are you then? My name is Nakshatra, I'm from Amaravathi. Capital of Andhra Pradesh. I'm Angel princess of Heaven. Ours is capital of heaven. Greetings, King! Mars, you made rain nectar in King Indra's court with your enchanting music. Great! - We're blessed, king. Our people are doing fine, right Chitrasena? We're living happily with all comforts in heaven. What do we lack here? Everything is in abundance, king Nakshatra... princess daughter of Gandharva king! Lost in thoughts? I've a doubt, Sage. - What's it? I heard about human life is fine and fantastic on earth. Is it true? 100% true. It's not earth anymore, it is heaven on earth. Humans on earth are not like in olden times. Iphones, Imax, Twitter and Facebook! They're travelling faster that lightning. Chatting, meeting and dating! They're having a ball with world on their palm in the form of a phone. Stories about heaven and angels are comedy films to them. We've just nectar here to drink. But earth people have Beer, Whisky, Vodka, Breezer. With so many liquor varieties, they're enjoying life to the top. Moreover recently added shots. - What does it mean? Tequila! - What's that? We don't have it here, even if I tell you can't understand. We've just Ramba, Urvasi and Menaka for entertainment. Same old models since time immemorial. But on earth, they've so many beauties like Deepika, Katrina, Samantha, Ileana! Many new beauty additions too. They've turned earth into heaven! If anyone has a doubt here, I've to clear it. They have Google there. If anyone has to send message here, I've to go personally. They have WhatsApp there. You're Princess of Gandharva, right? How many friends you have here? - 5 or 6! Even a beggar has 500 to 600 Facebook friends. Many have started night life on earth. - Night life? Nice, fill me details. They get up after the world sleeps. Boisterous fun begins then! Pubs, Clubs, Bike races, midnight biryanis, liquor, dances, parties! I mustn't tell this but they're enjoying life! They're enjoying life! Greeting to mother and father! A small request. - Tell me, dear. Father, I'm impressed with life on earth and humans. What do you lack here, dear? Wait, my consort. Earth is the worst and dirtiest place to live among the 14 worlds! Yes, dear. Humans are mean, imbecile and diseased! Not only that they kill for property, cheat others for power! Earth is polluted and unfit to live. We're residents of heaven. Eternal and beyond the reach of time. We've golden bodies that don't sweat. Its happiness and bliss here. It's just difficulties there. How can there be happiness without difficulty, father? Is there meaning for happiness without sorrows, father? What are you saying, Nakshatra? Yes father, sadness-happiness, happiness-sorrow. hunger-food, life is exciting only if you face these. I wish to enjoy human life to its fullest. So, I humbly request you to grant me permission to visit earth. I'm rejecting your request. - Please forgive me. I've decided to fulfill my wish. Then go, I curse you to become a statue. What have you done with her, Lord? Have you turned our daughter into a statue? No, human life is disgusting. Our kind hearted daughter can't bear it. That's why I turned her into a statue. If someone makes her happy, she'll regain her natural form. She'll turn into a statue if she faces unbearable difficulties. How long this will go on? The day she feels human life is difficult and her wish is fulfilled. She'll return to our world. Till then... What's that for? Can't differentiate between real and fake. If we die and go up there, for the sins we've committed here, I'm sure we'll be fried in oil, if sister supports us then, we could get saved. Fool, she's narrating a film story, will you believe her? For my personal safety... Safety? Go home safely...go... - Bye, I'll never meet you again. If you're an angel, you must sing song 'O man, what's your wish'? But your language and slang is just like ours. I know all the languages and slangs on earth. Do you know to speak in Tamil? I know very well, brother. - Brother? What's this, man? She's lying to escape. This is not a lie but truth, brother. If you're an angel, then I'm a devil. Let me, which God will come to save you! Will you bring any girl you see to city outskirts? Bloody rascals! Who are you? Want partnership? Come after 10 minutes, go. Is it property to share, you son of gun? What are you doing here then? Go away. Buddy, they've grown like pigs gulping tons of biryanis. Thrash them black and blue! Thrash me? That's it. Come on, boys. Why are you kicking me? Let's run, boys! Where are you going away? Please, no brother... - Tamil? Yes, brother...from Chennai. Chennai? What are you doing here? They said rapes are easy in Hyderabad. That's why I came here catching a bus. Did you come all the way from Chennai to rape in Hyderabad? Yes, brother. What's happening in Hyderabad, buddy? You wait, let's take him to task. Get up. Are you from Chennai? To rape? Did you come from Chennai to rape? Hit me but just for 5 minutes only, brother. Why? I must go back to Chennai catching a train at 10 pm. What's this? - He's getting late, hit him. Time is over. If I see you again in Hyderabad... - I'll never ever come here again. Look at him, he's swimming on land. Right. - Take me also with you, boys. Hey you... - Will you rape a girl? I'll give you time till tomorrow. Let me see how you rape! Forget about that. When did you see it for the last time? Daddy, I came here for rape. No daddy, I'm not here to rape but to watch rape. Are you here to watch rape? Daddy's permission for it? Bloody pig! Fatso! If we had come late, you would've been ruined, sister. Why have you lost weight, sis? I'm there for you, sis. Enough of it, come. Sister, this is our kingdom. We're the Kings and we're the Ministers. How is our palace? This is very nice. What's that? - Buddha's statue. We installed it. That one? - Birla temple. - We built it. Step in with right leg. This is our palace. This bed is for you, sleep on it, you'll sleep peacefully. Okay? Let's go, buddy. What I wanted to steal has come to me on its own! I'm very lucky. Is she awake or sleeping? God, help me do this! Anklets...bangles... I saw it last night but missing now. Buddy, her anklets are missing. - I removed it. Removed it? Give me once to see. I don't know if you're competitor or co-operating with me. How long will you twirl your few strands of moustache? Show me once, please. You saw it last night, right? You never believed me in all these of years of friendship, right? Watch, I'm jumping down. - Jump. Too high, I'll die, buddy. If you jump down, I'll take everything. You? Any new scheme? Looks like she's from a rich family, may've run away from home after a fight, Someday someone will come for her, let's return her to them, they'll pay us in millions, we can settle in life as rich men! How deeply you think about life, buddy! You're my Swami Nithyananda, buddy. Chicken pieces? - I blessed your soul to rest in peace. It is prayer for the dead. How well she's dressed! Top is mine and down is yours, buddy. Buddy, we spent Rs.10000 for her dresses. We may go bankrupt if we eat in this restaurant.

Looks like we'll lose our respect, come buddy. I'll eat everything. Sit here. Order food from menu card. How can she? She ate from all the plates. I want everything on menu. Won't she stop? First time I felt hunger. - First time? Hunger is very good. - Hunger is good? Is it chocolate or biscuit to be good? She ate like a gargantuan! At last... Do you've anything else? - Yes, sir. Fennel seeds? Buddy stop...pub! Let's go inside. Come, my dear...Reach the heaven... Sit here, buddy. Where is she? Look, how she's dancing after having a go at food. Where?

Get into the car. Nandu is here. Nandu is here. Where did you go away all these days? We searched for you everywhere. What happened, dear? She can't answer your questions, sir. Nandu met with a major accident in Hyderabad. Accident? I got her admitted in hospital. I saved her life but she forgot her past. Forgot her past? You say accident but I don't see any wound marks. Who is he, madam? All are happy for the safe return of the girl. He's worried about wound marks. He doesn't know how to talk! Foolish man! Grandma! It's natural to be faulty. Poor kid, don't worry. I'll take care of everything. I'll stay here for few days. Can Nandu recollect past? - Why not? Yesterday she told me village's name, she may tell your name now. Tomorrow she may tell all your names. Why worry, grandma? I'm there with you, right? I'll stay here for a week and make her tell all your names. Till then, I'll stay here. Okay, Nakshatra? What's this, sir? Madam's name is Nandu, right? I don't know that, right? She looks like a pure pearl and shining like star, so I named her as Nakshatra. Yes...Nakshatra. Dear, I'm your father. Have you forgotten your mother? Nandu, I'm your grandmother. It's difficult to learn so many relationships at a time. If she recollects so many memories at a time, doctor says may forget what she knows now. Then, nobody must ask any question with my granddaughter. This is right. Grandma, don't worry, I'm there with you, right? In just 10 days I'll return your original Nandu to you. I'll stay here only. Come, dear. - Come in, dear. Take her inside. Come...come.. - Go inside. Thank God, shelter is confirmed. You didn't bring back my daughter, you brought back happiness of this village. Nandu is not just my daughter, she's daughter of every home here. Thank you very much. - No problem, sir. Come back to me, my statue. Brother, he has very powerful background. Background for him? What nonsense are you saying? Suddenly a big gang turned up to thrash us black and blue. We found his friend. Why are you carrying me? Get him down. Tell me, what's his background? Help me get down. You want his background, right? Move, please. If you want his background, your necessity is my advantage. Why are you staring at me? Massage my hands. Fatso, my legs. You massage my hands. Little harder! I'm tensed, tell me about him. If you know his background, your foreground will get wet. Is Nayeem behind him? - He's dead. Is it Dawood? - He's hiding. Then, who is he? Tell me! - It's me! I'm his background. Why have you gone silent after knowing background, goons? What? Hey you...not like that... Happiness left this house with you and has come back along with you. Everything here makes us remember you. We're living with your memories since you left. I'm seeing happiness on your father's face after long time. What for those tears then, father? Till yesterday they were tears now they are tears of joy. You won't make me cry again, right? Do you love Nandu so much? Not love, Nandu is my life. I mean you're my life. Did your wife deliver the child, Chanti? Yes madam, it's a girl. Oh God! Madam is recollecting past! God is there! Come Nani, let's go around the village. Come. Village is very beautiful, right? Green fields, canals. Did you bring my sugar tablets, Nandu? Hasn't your sugar come down, uncle? It increased from the day you went missing. Now that I'm here, it'll come down. - Yes, dear. Okay, go. Come, Nani. We've to see entire village. Why did you lie to me? Entire village adores you, your parents love you so much. Why did you come to Hyderabad leaving all of them? Why did you become Nakshatra and cheat me? I never lied to you, Nani. I'm not Nandu, I'm Nakshatra. Nandu is another girl. She knows the meaning of happiness. She knows the weight of sadness. She knows the value of tears. I know about her. Harvest festival of Sankranthi comes once a year for everyone. But this village has Sankranthi once in a week. Every Saturday and Sunday turns festive with Nandu's arrival. Looks like you've given up sweets. Yes, I had to give up for diabetes. Father! Why are you eating before madam's arrival?- Grandma! She's here, right? So, you started eating on hearing car sound. What are you searching, Seenu? You said 'Rachchabanda', right? I'm checking if Roja or Jeevitha are here. Didn't come. Go ahead. Farmer takes loan to grow crops. He's so unlucky that he can't fill his stomach too. We don't have money to send children to school. Forget about school sister-in-law. We're struggling to give them two meals a day. We lost everything in floods, we're in the process of regaining now. He wants us to pay entire loan now. If not he threatens to take away our lands. If not take your lands, do you want him to massage your legs? If you ask them to pay immediately, how can they pay? Harvest will be bumper this time, right? What's the guarantee that floods will not ruin it again? How can we pay without harvesting the crop? How dare you raise your voice on me! You fell on my feet requesting humbly to save you. Why are you getting angry now? You calm down. But Govt. says it'll pay farmers' loans. They'll promise anything for votes. You too vote for notes only. I don't to hear anything. Will you pay? Will you? Why are you silent? If you've head ache, they'll suggest a balm. Everyone will advice. But no one will come forward to apply. That's it. I'm giving you 3 days time. If you don't repay the loan, forget about your lands. You signed the documents, right? Looks like we'll lose our lands. Let's see what happens! This weekend Goa trip was fantastic! 2 days full fun! I didn't feel like coming back from there. We enjoyed a lot! You know? You always visit your village every weekend, don't you get bored? No place on earth is greater than hometown. Can I've your attention for 2 minutes? Can you tell who's responsible if we're eating food happily here? She's a great cook. Our cook is great. Farmer! We're eating happily because of farmers' hard work. If farmers don't work hard, we'll not get food to eat. Actually we all are from farmers' family. What did your grandfather do, daddy? Agriculture, we had 100 acres of land. Is it? If we dig our past, I think all of us belong to farmer's family. Why are you talking about this now, Nandu? If we get better salary, we'll quit and go to any country. Though he faces loss, farmer never gives up agriculture. He works on his fields forever. If farmer stops producing food, countries will die in hunger not in war. Farmers are now in distress. Situation is not favourable to him, unable to take home harvest, failing to settle loans, they're being pushed to forgo their lands. It's happening in my village now, it could happen in your village in future. What should we do now, Nandu? We're young blood, we've the capacity to find a solution to this problem. I didn't get you, Nandu. We must help those farmers. If you want to help them, transfer some funds to this savings account. Why did you fall for it, buddy? My forefathers appeared before me on hearing Nandu's speech. For me too! We're more satisfied now than enjoying in tour. We're happy and content for helping our forefathers. I'm Nandu here. Tell me, how much farmers owe you? Why? Are you going to pay for them? It's not Rs.20000 to swipe your card. It's Rs.20 lakhs! Tell me your account number. Account number? Take it down. Collection is Rs.12 lakhs, how will you pay Rs.8 lakhs? From my savings account. I've transferred it along with interest. Rs.20 lakhs?! I'm coming, keep the documents ready. Nandu left for her village to see smiles on farmers' faces. Is Nandu dead? Yes, her parents or anyone in this village knows about it. How do you know about that? Here! Throw here! A girl from earth is here. She's exactly like you. Stop! Look there! True! You're exactly like me. Who are you? Why are you dull? You're in heaven now. Only happiness and bliss are here. I was fine there. - There? Where? My village. Your village? What's there in your village? My parents, relatives, friends. Love, affection! Bonds and fondness. You can understand only if you experience it. I was in the form of statue, I was happy hearing your praise. I turned into human. 'Queen of Heaven and Innocent Nani'. Watch today! What a story! Your story is rocking! Why are we still here? Had we met Rajamouli, he would've made 'Bahubali-3'. What I told you is true... - Enough...stop it. You said about Nandu and her death, I really felt sorry for her. Now you told me a story, it was all a big lie! I dared to take on Harish bhai for you. I had only one friend, I hit him for your sake. I'm not telling you to be faithful to me. I'm telling you because I deserve to know the truth. I'm really mad man. There's no relationship between us for you to tell me the truth. Anyway, it wasn't your mistake. I imagined... It'll not work out between us. Our ways part here. I'll never ever show my face to you in life. Do you know anyone? - Yes Who? - You both! What's your father's name? - Gandharva Raju. Where is he? - Up there! Are you really an angel? You told me truth but I didn't believe you. I went after small things in life but failed to see wonder before me. How can I believe an angel is with me? Agreed it was my mistake, can't you forgive me once? Though I lost my parents as little boy, I never felt I was an orphan. But when you left me, first time I'm feeling like an orphan. I'll not allow you to go. I don't have anyone other than you. Who can I share my grief with? You're the only one for me, I can't live without you. Small eyes have created wonders... Beauty is ravishing... Happiness abounds.... unbelievable joy... I found new relationships because of you... Has a world beauty wished for my friendship? Wonder has come in the form of girl into my life... This magical relationship developed into great bond... It has developed into a never ending bond... Earth and sky have united like us... Far and near united to create magic... Everything came true in different form... I saw a new world that I never saw earlier... Won't new desires bloom wherever your feet tread.... Won't I be always with you as your heart beat? You made me see this new world... My joy has touched the sky... I feel I'm in a world of wonder when you're with me... Your smile is bewitching like the smile of an innocent baby... May I present you a colourful world turning day and night as my eyes... Last week I saw a piece of agriculture land. Road corner and a tree on the side corner. Is it the land with Banyan tree? Brother, please don't go after it. Please listen to me. What happened? You took their land documents. His wife committed suicide by hanging herself. She has become a ghost now. Ghost? Are you mad? Call it here once. I'll grab the lines on her hand too. Call it, we'll gang rape the ghost. Why power cut now? What happened, brother? Didn't you see? Ghost is here. Brother, I've urgent work, I'm leaving. You said you'll grab lines on my hand, right? Come on do it. Will you gang rape me, guys? Where's sister? Let's go! Brother, bureau door is open! Documents! Someone has taken away the documents. Documents, promissory notes, who did this? Where are my documents? From today, you own your lands. I paid all your loans to the loan shark Raja. You're angel who has come from heaven. You're an angel! May God bless you! We both know Nandu paid the loans. If I tell people here, they'll lynch you to death. Clear out immediately. I'm not here to ask about that. - Then? You took away documents of neighbouring village along with this. I'll not spare you! Get going! - I'll see your end. No more problems to the people of this village. We fulfilled Nandu's wish. I'm very happy with people here and their love. Inside... Couldn't find the statue, James? Give me little time, I'll deliver the statue. I got his friend. Gently...gently... Who is he, brother? He looks like brand ambassador of coal. How dare you hit me! You're from my native place, my district, my state, my country. I'll accept if you hit me. How dare a foreigner hit me! You feed me, you can hit me, I'll not protest. Some bloody bastard.. Fall on ground! If get angry, I'll pump bullets into you, be careful! What's this? You complexion dirtied my hand. Were you born to crows? No! I can't understand whom should I save from whom! He's a mad man, go away, James. No more bullets in it, hey dark man, go away. Get lost, man! If you were not here, he would've killed me. My grandpa told me you can give your life for your bread giver. I'll offer you any food you ask! Tell me, what do you want? Millet balls, head curry, meat, sorghum bread and crab curry. Bring everything, I'm hungry. I don't see you off late, where did you go away, Ramaiah? I went to my daughter's home. What's all this for? Groom's people are here to see my daughter. Good family, groom is very good boy. Are you still here? Groom's people may arrive any moment. Come with me, I've to get you ready. Mother....Nani... - Where will he go? He'll stay here till your marriage. Why are you sitting with bowed head? Didn't like the groom? Tell me, dear! Do you like the boy or not? Lift your head and look at him, dear. It seems she doesn't like him. I like him. I know you like my daughter, can I bring better man for her than you? How dare a lowly man marries my princess daughter? No way! Greetings, King! My daughter went to visit earth, she fell for the sweet talk of humans, believing their love as true, she's ready to leave heaven forever. If you put this chain on my daughter's neck, she'll develop hatred for human life and come back to heaven. Please bring back our daughter, Garuda. As you wish! If I tell Giri, he would come running here. Hail Goddess Mother! Hail Goddess Mother! Hail Goddess Mother! You're going to marry soon! But you'll face difficulties! Life after marriage will not be happy because of that. If you put this chain on her neck, everything will be fine. If I put this chain on my wife's neck, my problems would get solved, right? I know! This chain on your neck will bring change in you. You'll blush and start respecting your husband. No more any shrieks and shouts, I don't have any more problems. Till now I was Geeta's husband Chandra. Hereafter it's Chandra's wife Geeta. You must sit or stand or sleep on my order. Scratch if I ask you, what do you say? I beg you, please leave me. You said life will be happy after wearing the chain. But I got thrashed brutally, why? Fool! People who are given this amulet, only they must wear it. If anyone else wears it, effect will be like this. If I marry, I'll become human for life. I'll never become a statue again. - Really? Thank God! You know this? Son-in-law comes from outside to any family. But we both are outsiders, you as Nandu and me as their son-in-law. What are you saying? Isn't she Narayanamurthy's daughter Nandu? - Yes, sir. Why do you say she's not Narayanamurthy's daughter Nandu? She's exactly like that, right? There are seven similar people in this world. Wow! What a great news you brought for me! I'll show them what I am! Somebody is getting married here. I'll steal at least one jewel, pawn it and drink to my heart's content. I've plenty of work! Are they here for marriage or security men for their wives? Security won't be so tight in Reserve Bank too. Welcome, Swami! You are...? Devotee of Goddess Mother! We're lucky to have such honoured guests. My granddaughter is getting married. It'll not happen. If it happens, she's fated to become widow. Bad time is waiting to take over her life. You're a Swami, please find a way to overcome it. Blessings of Goddess Kali, put this on her neck. Everything will be fine. Hail Goddess Sambhavi! She's going away! Grandma, please take care of my child. I'll go to toilet. Give her to me. Come quickly. - Okay. Why are you crying? My darling! Why are you crying, dear? Please don't cry. Mother will be here now! Grandma, please! Take her. Don't cry, dear, I'm back, right? Aren't you my darling? Please don't cry. What happened? What? What happened? Why are you creating trouble in my daughter's marriage? Your daughter? She's not your daughter. You won't believe me. He's coming, right? I'll make him to tell the truth. Is she Nandu, the girl you brought from city? Are you Nandu? Yes. - Yes? Yes. Are you Nandu? Tell me...tell me... May I tell who she is? She's not your daughter. Let her be anyone's daughter, my job is done. Hey fatso, my chain! She's not your daughter...not... She'd daughter of this village! He's my brother! Brother? What has happened to him? How can he be your brother? Can we break relations if they don't invite us? My brother! What happened to him? Uncle, I wish to conduct this marriage. It seems he wishes. Please don't say no, uncle. Don't have any second thoughts. I'll take care of everything, my boys are here to help. We'll conduct this marriage grandly. Did you create a scene for this? Marriage means fun, frolic and commotion. If not there won't be fun. Good, time for oil bath, take them to guest house. Go, son. Go...go...go my brother. You take care of kitchen, you take care of canopies and tents. You bring a horse, go...get going. Get going, boys...why are you still here? Why did you change the party suddenly? We can have a party any time. But marriage must happen at auspicious time only. Is the horse here already? What did I ask? What did he understand? My damn fate! Where's my chain? Welcome...welcome... Welcome...welcome... Welcome...welcome... He has become a flirt from loan shark. I got it and missed it immediately. Chain is on his neck. You're wearing such a big chain, I'll definitely steal it from you. I got you... Did he find it? Why did you come so late for my brother's marriage? I got little delayed for drinks. Mind your work! Go! - I'm on it, sir. I'm on it, sir. Hey drunkard, you know him? - Do you know who am I? I don't know. - I too don't know him. We've to go by the flow. Already I'm tensed for losing chain. When did that character change? When this character entered here? What my character is... Get cool drinks. - Coming, sir. Buddy! When did you come? Getting ready! I was about to call you, brother. Where's the statue? Let marriage get over, we can discuss about it later. What's there to talk later? Uncle, leave his collar. - Why? If a grown up daughter goes astray, it's mistake of mother. If a grown up son goes astray, it's mistake of father. If someone holds younger brother's collar, it's mistake of elder brother. If you want, hold my collar, uncle. He missed my statue and I lost Rs.3 crores. If he doesn't settle my matter now, I'll kill him. Do you only have a gun? Do you think I can't use it? I'll pump the magazine into you. Who is this Godzilla? What's happening here? How do I know? So many people fighting for a chain! How many people may fight for it, the chain is mine! The chain is mine in climax. I beg you...please stop it. It's my chain, please don't fight for it. What happened? I'll deliver your statue in 2 days. Forget about the statue. First marriage, then business. Auspicious time is nearing, let this marriage happen. Okay. This marriage will not happen. What happened to you now? Bride is Nandu at all! Thank God, he's normal now. Bride is not Nandu, she's Nani's future wife. She's Mrs.Nani. I think he lost his balance now. Let me see how this marriage will happen! What will you see? What will you see, man? Do you know who am I? Loan Shark Raja! If you're local, I'm international crook. Mafia Harish bhai! Isn't it, Nani? You go inside, I'll take care of him. I got it! Lost it again! Buddy! Stop it! What's your problem? Nani cheated me. You're an idiot! What's your problem? He fooled me and stole my Rs.3 crore statue. You're indeed a fool! He's marrying there, you both should attack him, why are you fighting among yourselves? Bloody fools! Wasted your time. - Let's go and finish him. Closed the gate, who are you, man? What's that walk? - You're overacting! Clear out from here in 5 minutes! Do you know the game of train? I know. - Then, gather. 1There's one track here, how can two trains go on it? Chug out! Stop...stop... Where's the train going? - Hyderabad. Hyderabad...then, I'll get down in Warangal. Go, drop him there. Which gang do you belong to? Didn't board the train? How dare you come closer! Come in bridal dress. Get bride to offer prayers. Priest is calling, change dress and come quickly. Come quickly. Come out, girls...come out. Why are we here, Garuda? You came to visit earth. Your father ordered me to bring you back to heaven. Come, let's go. Where are you going? Who are you? Who am I? Have you gone mad? We're marrying in few minutes, asking me now, who am I? Lowly man! How dare you want to marry an angel! It'll not happen. - It will happen! You can't stop it. Why am I getting tears when you hit him? Because you love me. You love me, that's why! Bon in sins and raised in selfishness. You fight among yourselves for jealous and anger. You're lowly man! How dare you love an angel! Love has no difference for human and angels. Not just on earth, there's no power greater than love in any world. How dare! Love makes anyone brave! I'll kill you! - I'm ready! I'll meet Nakshatra in heaven. Then, die! Daughter of village! Forget about statue! First marriage... Stop Garuda! I love him, my life is with him only. Leaven the comfort of heaven, are you going to live with him here? Heaven is here not there. Heaven is in love here. Relations, relationships, friendship and bonds have happiness! God has created real heaven in human bonding. There's happiness in difficulty. Joy is there along with grief. This is real heaven. You can go now. Okay. God bless you! Is this the end of our daughter's life? No, Nakshatra has become human totally. Aging and death is inevitable to humans. They've to come here, that's also inevitable. Till then, you've to wait.
