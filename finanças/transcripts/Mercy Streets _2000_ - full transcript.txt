Not bad, except for the drop. Now, remember, keep it natural. Don't favor that side. No one should know you're gonna pull a gun. But it's slipping. Then do it again, and again a million times. You know, I could really make you into something. Let me ask you something, preacher. You think people got free will? I believe people have the freedom to make their own decisions. But God has a plan, right? Absolutely. He has a plan for everyone's life. -Even yours, Rome. -Mm-hmm. All right, keep that going. So this crime you're about to commit-- that's part of God's plan for your life? No, you're making me do this. Oh, so you're saying I have power over God. That's not what I'm saying. You're twisting my words. I'm saying I'm doing this to help my brother, and that's a good thing. Well, you can't just ignore the bad thing. I mean, you're stealing from people here. I'm pretty sure that's a sin. If you'd just give me the gun with the fingerprints on it, I wouldn't have to do this. You don't have to do this. I mean, if you're so certain that God has this good plan... Are you trying to talk me out of this? Nope, never. I'm just trying to figure out what you're doing here. You seem to think it's right to steal from the innocent just so your criminal brother doesn't get the justice he deserves. Yes. He's my brother. So what you're saying is it is better to take care of things yourself... even if it means going against God. -No. -'Cause God's got -this big plan, right? -Yes. And was it God's plan that I saved your brother's life? What? That I dragged him from the river and took him in? Was it God's idea... for you to leave him there to die? No, I don't, I don't know! You don't know? You don't know what's right, and you don't know what's wrong. So why are you here? I'm here to save my brother, that's it. Exactly. You're here to save your brother's life, so you can just forget everything else. Come on, do it again. Do it again. 11,415 bucks. Thanks, God.

There was this little empty space under the stairwell where we'd get a flashlight, and we'd stay there for hours, telling each other stories about getting out into the world and what we wanted to do. John always wanted to be a magician. (chuckles) When we were 14, we got moved to this really bad neighborhood. And this gang of kids were chasing us. And, uh, and we're trying to hide under this old metal bridge. But they got John, and they were beating him up pretty bad. YOUNG JOHN (distant): Jeremiah! JEREMIAH: And he kept... he kept calling my name, -Jeremiah! -and I didn't do anything. I just stayed down, watching. And they struggled, and he fell off the side of the bridge and he broke right through the ice. And I just stood there. Why didn't you help him? (voice breaking): I don't know. I was so scared.
