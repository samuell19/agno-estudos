[mysterious music plays] [birds chirping] [cell phone vibrating] [grunts] [urinating] [grunts] [glass shatters] [suspenseful music playing] [suspenseful music intensifies] [breathing heavily] - [gravel crunching] - [vehicle approaching] - [car doors opening] - [man] Shall we? Watch your step. [woman laughs] [door opening loudly] - [man] La casa del amor. - [woman] Ah! I forgot how gorgeous this place is. I mean, look how good this looks. [man] Where the fuck are all the flowers? [woman] What? [man] I told April to buy an inordinate amount of flowers, - and I don't see one flower. - It's okay. It's fine. It looks beautiful. No, that-that... That's not really what I had in mind.. What are you doing? [woman laughs] - I can yell at April later. - No! - Baby, get these clothes off. - No. [laughs] No. Unpack first, okay? Please? - Unpack first. - Why? Because I'm classy, and I would rather the bedroom than the living room, and... No! [woman laughs] [man] You wanna see if they bothered to stock the fridge? - [woman] Yes, I'm checking. - [clattering] I will unpack the bags. [man] What's the fucking point of having an assistant… [loudly] Uh, there's milk that's expired. Great. And orange juice that's open. [laughs] Didn't you tell April we were coming? Babe, I-I-I thought we discussed not yelling at each other from across the house. Right. Yeah. [suspenseful music continues] It's fine. It just means we have to go ourselves and... [man] Is there no food? [man] Babe? Hello? Babe? Are you not... Are you not answering because I'm yelling or because you can't hear me... Holy fuck! I need you to sit down on that couch. I'm not fucking around. Okay, but how about you let go of my wife first? I'll let her go when you sit on the couch! This isn't a negotiation. Sit down. Sit. - Okay. - Okay, I don't want to hurt her. [man] Sit down. - [husband] I'm sitting down. - Good. Now you sit down. Not there. Sit over there. You're not gonna fuck with me either. Do we understand each other? - Yes or no? - You can talk to me. Can I help you with something? Money? Is that what you want? Let me make that happen. You don't wanna hurt anyone, right? You're not the kinda guy that would hurt someone. You already know what kind of guy I am? Is that right? That's not what I'm saying. What do you want? Let me help you. What are you doing? Hey! - What are you doing? - What are you doing? - You don't need to... - I'm trying to cooperate. - We have money. - I'm trying to cooperate. - No one knows we're... - Shh. I'm gonna tie your feet together and you're not gonna move. You don't have to tie our feet. We're not gonna move. - Were you on staff? Is that what this is? - Not everybody works for you. [wife] Does it have to be so tight? Please. You're already cutting off my circulation. Hey! Hey! Get your hand out of your pocket. Give me your phone. Both of you. Put your phone on the table. Take it out! Put it on the table. You too. Phone, out. Put it on the table. Okay. - Is this your only phone? - Yes. That's my only phone. Yeah? You sure? Maybe I should check. Okay, okay. There you go. Great job. Now I gotta check her purse. See what you did? - [wife] You don't have to do that. - Yeah? I didn't. Now I do. [breathing heavily] How the fuck do you open this? How does this open? - Is there a trick to the purse? - No! There's a fucking clasp. I got it. [husband] Okay. You obviously... You... You want money, yes? I want to give you money, okay? I-I know I've got some cash squirreled away here somewhere. [wife] We have some for emergencies. Yes. For emergencies. Now, we're never here, so it's going to take me a second to remember where the fuck this money might be, but I'm going to get it to you and get you on your way. I-I found your watch. Your Rolex. Yeah. I-I see that. And in there, I found some money in a hollowed-out book. - There's probably more... - We have more. Yes. If there's anything else, it's going to be in the office, so can I get up and take you into the office? Slow. [husband] You okay, baby? - [man] She's fine. - Yeah. [man] Okay. You can let go. Go. If you move, I'm gonna hear you. [husband] She's not going to move. It'll be all right, baby. Just gimme one minute. I know we had a secret compartment put in here somewhere. Hey! Do not try anything. I'm not. I'm trying to get you your money. You seem to know who I am, right? Is there something you would like for me to call you, sir? Sooner we're out of here, the better. Okay? Hey. Hey, look at me. Look at me. I'm gonna ask you a question. You're going to tell me the truth. Is there a gun in this house? No. Is that it? Anything else? No. [husband] See? Gimme that. Go. Go. It's around 5,000. So, between my Rolex, the money you found in the office, and that, I'd say you had a pretty successful morning over at my house, huh? Anything else is gonna be too big to carry or too easy to trace. So that's it. And you have our phones. There's no landline. No landlines, no security cameras. And we don't have neighbors for miles. We don't even know them. So, for us, it's like you were never here. Exactly. We walked in. Some shit was already missing. But not even enough to… to file a police report. [man] Put your hands behind your back. No. Lean forward and put your hands behind your back! - Don't do that. Just go! - Have you not heard a thing I've said? Yeah. I heard everything you said. I'm not gonna leave you here to do whatever you want the second I walk out the door. You walk out, we forget you exist, end of story. - I'm gonna myself a head start. - No one knows we're here. I don't fucking believe you. Goddamn it! [moody music playing] Okay, so what now? [wife sighs] Just walk. - Any direction? - Yeah. To… To the right. This one. [husband] So, what is the plan here? [man] The plan is for you to shut the fuck up. Go. Straight. [husband] That's not really a plan. No, right here. Open the door. Get inside. What? Y-You're really gonna lock us in the sauna? This is your plan? To lock us in the fucking sauna for days on end with no food or water? [man] It's not gonna be days. I'm gonna barricade the door so it'll take a while, but you'll get out. This is the only thing that's gonna work for us. No, I'm not in the mood for a schvitz. [man] It's not gonna be on. Get in. No. You're going to have to rack your brain for something else. I don't wanna hurt you in front of your wife. Okay. Babe? [wife grunts] Ow. You're not gonna know when I'm gone. I suggest you wait like an hour before you start trying to get out. Mm-hmm, mm-mm. [brooding music playing] You know, uh, buddy, y-you're not getting what I've been trying to tell you. No one knows we're here! I was scheduled t-to give the keynote at CES this weekend, but I pulled out at the last minute, okay? I pulled out to surprise her! I moved fucking mountains to change my schedule for her! - And then you fucking showed up. - For us. - What? - For us. For us! Yes, that's what I said. For us! Which I did gladly so we could have a little fucking alone time! Okay? Enjoy the alone time, then. I'm gonna fucking kill him. I'm... I'm just gonna... I'm gonna fucking... Fuck! [husband] Hey! [husband] Hey! Fuck! I really don't think he had a gun. [tense percussive music playing] [grunts] [phone ringing] [phone stops ringing] [breathing heavily] Okay. [car engine turns over] [engine shuts off] [moody music plays] Fuck! [sighs] [tense music plays] Okay. [mutters] [tense music intensifies] [husband] Hurry! Come on, come on. [man] Hey! [music stops] Hey, stop! [tense music resumes] Stop! Stop! Fuck. [panting] I'm gonna fucking get you! Stop! Stop! Stop, sto... - Stop, what the fuck! - I win! I got you. Just stop. Don't make us run anymore. Any way you go, I'm gonna get you. Just stop. Stop. - [both panting with effort] - Or... No. Stop. Stay down. Stay down. I'm not fucking around. Get her back here. - I've got him! Get back here now. - [husband yells] Babe! [husband] Babe! I've got your gun. Whose camera is that? How am I supposed to know that? A-And are you sure that what you saw was even a camera? Am I sure that... Yes, it was a camera. Where does it go? [husband] I have no idea. Also, you know as well as I do, once something is recorded digitally... If it even was... It's just out there. There's nothing you can do about it. It's not like a 7-Eleven where you can go in the back and-and tear out a hard drive. Everyone's an idiot to you, huh? No, not everyone. - You lied to me. - [husband] I'm not lying. We have no security cameras on our property. Really? Just like there's no gun? Speaking of which, how about we establish some... some ground rules on that gun? - Meaning what? - Meaning I have no idea how much you've used or been around guns, but if you're going to be pointing it at one of us, you can point at me. Okay? I haven't pointed it at anybody yet. I know that. All I'm saying is, we know you have a gun. We're not going anywhere. And to prevent any fucking… [makes gunshot noises] …oopsie-doopsies, just put the safety on. Safety's on. So, nothing accidental. [husband] Great. But the question remains, what do you want me to do? It's the same situation, guys. It's not the same situation. Not if my face is out there. Not if I have to… hide from this. You think five grand is gonna cut it? All that's changed is the amount you need, right? Am I right? We still all... All three of us, we have to find a way through this. So it comes down to how much and how soon. So… how much? To what? To disappear? Start a new life? Looks like that's what it's going to take. So… you know… A hundred... A hundred... Hundred fifty thousand dollars. [husband chuckles] What? What is so fucking funny? - Hundred fifty thousand? - Hundred fifty thousand. You think that's enough? Yeah, I-I think you're going to want more. If you were looking for any reasonable quality of life, yes, that's right. Something tells me that maybe you and I have some very different pictures of quality of life. Oh, most definitely we do, but either way, I don't think 150,000 is going to cut it. You're going to blow through it like that. [snaps] Double it, then. Three hundred thousand. Babe. Where was this cutthroat negotiator when we were doing our prenups? [wife chuckles] Uh, anyway, one man's opinion, I think we're still too low. Great. Then let's, uh… let's add a zero. Three million. - [laughing] - What are you laughing at? Well, n-now you're just... You're sounding ridiculous. Excuse me. Aren't you worth several billion dollars now or something? Whatever I'm rumored to be worth, which is actually much more, that still doesn't mean that I can just pick up a little red phone and withdraw however much money whenever I want. That's not the way it works. Also, if I'm asking for three million dollars, well, don't you think that might set off a few alarm bells? Which isn't exactly what you want, correct? Fine! Then what is... What's the most that you can get? What's the... What is the max? You don't want the max. I want the f... I want the max! What's the max? I'm the only one here that has actually been inside a room with over a million dollars in it. Now, there are certain limitations to that kind of money. Not only the amount, but how much does that money weigh? How much can I physically carry? Do you have any idea how much three million dollars weighs? How much? Well, I don't know the actual weight. That's not the point. Point is that you have to think about how much can fit inside one suit... Just tell me the amount. Okay? Just tell... Wh-What's the... What's the number? [husband chuckles] Guys, I have to use the bathroom. What? I waited as long as I could. So, how we gonna do this? [man] Hey, hold on. Hold on. This curtain stays open. Wait, what? I… I can't go like that. - What's the problem? - Privacy? Okay. Uh… there's an option B, which is you pick a corner of the living room and do your business. I'm fine either way. - Tempting. - [husband groans] [exhales] Okay. [grunts] [husband] Hmm. Got it. Yeah. [husband] So why me? I mean, other than the obvious reason, why did you target my house? I think the less we know about each other, the better, don't you? This does not seem random to me. It seems like you knew there would be no security cameras… - [toilet flushes] - …and it seems you expected us to be gone. Due diligence on your part. Much better. [foreboding music playing] [husband] Four hundred fifty thousand. [man Let's round it up. Even 500. Just feels right to me. Okay, we could do that. But the problem... I-I remember. If I'm having any trouble carrying the extra 50, I'll, uh… I'll leave it in your pool. Half a mil it is. Let's go get you your money. [foreboding music rising] It's working. Hey. Stay where I can see you. - No, hey. [snaps] Audio. Audio only. - [husband mutters] Every time I call on the computer, - it's on video. - Yeah? Well, I don't care. Not this time. Have you ever called someone for a quick emergency delivery of 500k? Yes. Just last week I did. Okay, look, I can get you the money. It will, however, require a little fucking finesse. If I call and ask my assistant to arrange this kind of cash, and don't do it face-to-face, that might seem a little suspicious. I'm gonna be standing right here. - Perfect. - Right here. And if you so much as blink in a way that I find questionable, we're gonna have a problem, okay? So, no... no nose-scratching. No, uh, no code words. Okay, Matt Helm. Copy that. Who the fuck is Matt Helm? [exhales] Dean Martin? "Talk about a booby trap." You never seen that? Uh, just... just focus on what we're... On this. - All right. - [keyboard clicks] [computer beeps] [groans] - April. - Hey! Wasn't expecting to hear from you. - How'd it go with the flowers? - Don't even get me started on the flowers. - Um, all right. - Um… I have a situation that needs to be dealt with quickly and discreetly. Okay? Okay. I need $500,000 delivered to me in cash here. Five hundred thousand in cash? Okay. - Debbie is back. - [April whispers] Wait, what? - Even with the NDA? - Okay, shut up. My wife is here, so that's all I can say. But how quickly can you get this to me? Well, it's gonna be tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - Yeah. You can't get it to me today? I don't see how. How do you know off the top of your head that you can't? It's already 3:30. By the time I get the paperwork together and process, - the bank won't even... - Okay! Fuck. Tomorrow. - Tomorrow when? - By tomorrow evening. Tomorrow afternoon, okay? - Let's say tomorrow afternoon. - Okay. I'll get it done. I want 400,000 in hundreds, the rest in 20s. Single bag. We can use the same PI as last time. Have him drop it off outside the gate, okay? Send me a confirmation email by noon tomorrow. Okay? You're going to give me some nod of acknowledgment that you heard one thing I said? - Yes. Okay. I'm on it. - Make it happen, April. Fuck! Debbie, huh? You're a real class act. You don't fucking know me. Go fuck yourself. [moody music playing] No knives. [wife clears throat] [wife sighs] What, are we supposed to make small talk? Well, I-I mean, you guys could talk to each other. - Or is that not something you're used to? - Not at gunpoint, no. It's not like we can ask you your name or where you're from or what you do, or did, for a living, and, well, it's sunny out, so the weather's covered. Hobbies and favorite color probably are safe. Him, I've read plenty about. But you're a mystery, so why don't you start? My favorite color's black. I can tell. What's this tattoo you're getting removed on your foot? [husband] How about you stop looking at my wife's feet, yeah? It was nothing. [man] The tattoo was nothing? That was one of the ugliest tattoos I've ever seen in my life. Yeah, I know. You've made that pretty clear. [coughs, laughs] Yikes. Let's keep, uh, spinning this wheel. How'd you two meet? Honey? Um, we met at a fundraiser. - Cystic fibrosis. - Muscular dystrophy. Back when I was an assistant. Ah. Got it. You were his assistant. No. Not his assistant, an assistant. The route most people take. Unless, of course, you've made a fortune or rob people in their homes. Or work for your husband. [wife] I work with him. Okay, I head up our foundation, a job I'm highly qualified for, having worked for non-profits since before college. It's probably very similar, except now you just have all this money to play around with. I'm not playing around with anything. It's… It's not a game, okay? And not that I have to justify my resume to you, but now I'm in charge of building schools and hospitals - on four continents… - You are justifying. …so you can try and belittle what I do all you want, but results speak for themselves. And you can go ahead and question my motives, but at least I know what I'll be doing for the next 4 or 5 years. That's not exactly true. You'll be taking on more of an advisory role once we have a baby. Right, babe? [clicks tongue] Right. That's the plan. [gloomy music plays] Did I or one of my companies do something to harm or offend you personally in some way? It really feels like you hate me. [man] Huh. I don't fucking get it. How can people be so mad at me? It's like fucking being mad at a fucking clock. If you're mad at a clock, that's really on you. It's not about the clock. I'm supposed to apologize for writing an algorithm that was inevitable and that saves companies and enriches the lives of hundreds of employees? [man laughs derisively] - Did I say something funny? - Yeah. Hearing you talk about enriching people's lives is funny to me. [husband] Do I not do that? You know, it's really pretty fucking rudimentary. A bloated, fat company dies, all jobs lost. Or a leaner, more efficient version of that same company survives, some jobs survive. If anything, I'm helping people find a new career path that's more sustainable. But you, however… You are here for the sole purpose of enriching yourself. [man] You have no idea what I'm here for, or even if that money is just for me. It's meaningless to you, anyway. Money that could change any other person's life. I just doubt you're going to give it all to the poor. [gloomy music continues] Hey, what is this? - What does it look like? - It's a Zen garden. Just like the little ones you see on people's desks, but big. Last time I was here, I had the idea of putting in a Mr. Miyagi-style fence, so it's in. Remember? Yeah. I still don't know what that means. A Mr. Miyagi-style fence. All right, guys. What's, uh, what's up next on the agenda? What other shit you have around here you don't use? [horses neighing] - [wife laughing] - [horse neighs] [wife laughs] [actor gurgling on-screen] [actor spits] [brooding instrumental music playing] Good work. You need to get close to him, babe. Win him over. What? What are you... We don't know this guy. We don't know what he intends to do once he gets the money. So, you need to get close to him. Do whatever it takes. Okay? - I don't... - Do whatever it takes. That's it. You can do it. [man] All right. Either of you have a preference? I still don't understand why you think it's necessary to split us up. Yeah. Well, like I said, for my peace of mind. So… why don't you go ahead and choose? Babe? - Do you have a preference? - I-I don't care. Why don't you take this one over here? Not like either one of us are going to sleep anyways. Just remember, I'll be right over here the whole night, okay? Okay? [wife sniffs] Okay? Yeah. [man] Doors stay open. - [husband] Shut the light off? - [man] If it helps you. [brooding music continues] [fire crackling] Can't sleep. [wife sighs] Okay. It's gonna be a long night. Yeah. Followed by a very long day. [wife chuckles] And the only man I know who could fall asleep during his own kidnapping. [chuckles] I guess it's one of those "if you don't laugh, you cry" moments, huh? [clears throat] Do you mind? No. I don't mind. [wife exhales] [wife exhales] Your life is gonna be very different after tomorrow. My life became very different the second you two walked through the front door. I was almost gone, too. I was leaving. Couldn't help myself. What are you gonna do? The end of the day, everything being totally different, that's okay with me. - I get that. - Oh. You do? I think everyone feels that at least once or twice in their life. Do you? There was a time I didn't know what I wanted to do with myself, like anybody else. Then you found your purpose with him, huh? He and I found it together. Picture perfect. Picture perfect. That's great. You guys are trying to have a kid? That's what he said? We are. Congratulations. That takes any relationship to a whole new level. Must be tricky if one person is really rarin' to go and the other person isn't quite as ready, right? Not my business, though. No. That's not my business at all. Like we said, picture perfect. What about you? You said before we didn't know if the money was just for you. You're asking if I have a girlfriend? Or if there's anyone. Mm. You don't have to answer, obviously. Yeah. I'm not going to. You want that? [can pops] [clears throat] It's a lot for you. The, uh, the money that's coming. It's a lot for anybody. Should be. The way he was able to get that much cash together so quickly… He said it was for another Debbie, didn't he? You know what? Fuck it. I'll take one. [sighs] Oh. That's good. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. [sighs] I'm supposed to be so grateful… And just take everything in stride, because… look at my life, and the good that I get to do. But, uh, the truth is, I… I miss my old life. [inhales] I miss my friends, and I miss… feeling normal. - Okay, I'm sorry. I just... - And, um... I'm sure you're a nice person, but you're not some victim. You're just a person who made a trade. You know that, right? You're just like the rest of us. I knew I wasn't marrying just him. I can remember… On my wedding day, everyone was just waiting. And I was standing there, staring down at my feet. And if I went forward, if I walked down the aisle, I knew exactly what would happen in the next 30 or 40 years. I knew. And if I went back, if I didn't walk down the aisle, I-I wasn't sure what to expect. But it would have been mine. My choice and mine alone. Maybe for the very last time. I went forward. But if I'm being honest, I… I didn't know if I would until I took that very first step. Well? Well, what? Was it worth it? Ask me again in 30 or 40 years. Um… [sighs] …all right, well, I, uh, I should get some sleep. Night. [exhales] [object scraping] Thanks. I'll take a Bloody Mary, too. Thanks. Wrong side of the bed, love? Was there a right side? [sniffs] [mysterious music playing] So, what company was it? [husband] Huh? You can't help yourself, huh? You were deemed… redundant, and let go. That's it, right? It's okay. You can tell me. I know what you're trying to do. Just drop it. Now, I owe you… something, right? If you owe a debt, it's to a hell of a lot more people than just me. Because of your little math equation, people's jobs disappear just like that. [snaps] - Don't even have time to prepare. - Prepare for what, exactly? Ask the coal miners if they're prepared for clean energy. There's this new thing going around, this new trendy mentality, you know, of… "I exist. So, therefore, you owe me." Are you familiar with this? That is the very reason why we live in a world full of lazy fucking loafers and freeloaders. They're too busy sitting, bitching, and moaning that when they're confronted with an obstacle, it's just… [groans] [morosely] "I guess that's it." [cries mockingly] But I… recognized the opportunity. And I did something about it every single fucking time. I didn't ask anyone for anything, and I didn't take anything that wasn't fucking mine! Not everyone who needs help is a freeloader. Babe, I was not referring to you or your charity. It was not a personal attack. It is personal. I needed help. Okay? And you paid my student loans. Am I a freeloader? No. No, because you don't think like that, do you? Do you? [rumbling] What the hell was that? [man] Everybody, be quiet. Don't say a fucking word. It's the fucking gardener. [suspenseful music playing] Okay, get into the office. Get into the fucking office right now! Go. Move! Go. All the way to the back. [breathing heavily] You didn't say anything about a gardener coming today. We didn't know. What's he doing here? I don't know. We don't deal with that kind of stuff. [suspenseful music continues] He's coming. He's coming. Just... Everybody, be fucking quiet, okay? [knocking at door] [knocking] - [knocking continues] - He's just gonna keep knocking. He sees our car. Just... Will you give him a chance to tire himself out? [knocking continues] [knocking continues] - Want me to go talk to him? - Yeah. Get rid of him. [husband] Fucking fix everything. Hey, we are this close. Do not fuck this up for us, okay? Hola. [gardener] Hello, sir. I'm so sorry to bother you. I, uh, I saw that… that you're here. Yes. We're here. How may I help you? [gardener] Uh, since you're not always here at home, I… I wanted to be able to say thank you myself. You're very welcome. It's such a pleasure to, uh, work on such a beautiful property, and I wanted to say to you and to your wife, uh… uh, gracias. Ah, you're too kind. And it's nice to meet you, see you... - I don't mean to bother you... - Gracias. I'll pass it along. No. - You're welcome. - Shut up. Shut up. Go to the bedroom. Both of you. Bedroom. [loud whirring] How long is this guy going to be here? [husband] Until he's done, I suppose. [loud whirring continuing] [loud whirring stops] Shit. I think he saw me. [knocking at door] [husband laughing] - Hello again. - I'm-I'm so sorry to bother you again. - Not at all. You remember my wife. - Of course. - Señora. - [wife] Hi. How are you? And, uh, this is her cousin. He just flew in from Portofino. - It's nice you have family here. - [husband] Yes. That's everything. Señor, while you're here, there's this one thing I want to show you. It would just take one minute. - You know... - No, how about we all go? - [gardener] Oh. Okay, yes. - Let's all go. The more the better. [gardener laughs] Follow me. This way. - [husband] So, what are we looking at? - I'll show you. Around the corner. Uh, you must have had a really nice drive, because the, uh, weather has been so nice. - It was a beautiful... - Hey, you know what, guys? Uh… We just put food in the oven. We have to get back inside. That can wait. What did you want to show me? I don't know if you've been able to see this, but, uh, I designed and I-I built and-and I put these planters here. Uh, it took me 18 weeks, but, uh, I think it was worth it. And… next, I was imagining, with your permission, right here, a beautiful, beautiful big oak tree, right in the center. - [husband] Huh. - I did do a little, simple sketch for you to show you what, uh, my vision is. Uh... It-It will take some time for it to grow, of course, but I was thinking that, you know, this is not just something for you to enjoy. Your children and your children's children. Yeah. Our children's children, baby. Wow. - That's... Wow. - [chuckles] I think that's why I drew my… my kids right here by the tree. - My boy and my girl. - I see that. And I showed this to the landscape person, but, um, you know... So, you're telling me that you designed all of this and built this yourself? - Sí, señor. - Wow. My friend, I have to say, this is very impressive. - Thank you, sir. - Beautiful work. It's very pretty. Well, uh, if you like it, maybe you can sign off on it. Oh. Just the, uh... It's time to go inside. - The tree... - [wife] Food's ready, love. - Right. - Hey, now. [husband] Right. - In the middle... - Thank you so much. - We have to go. - Let's go back. There is one more thing on this side. We're gonna have to do that later. - Thank you. I'm sorry. [wife chuckles] - [gardener] It will only take a minute. Sorry. [husband] You could learn something from this guy, buddy. [tense music playing] He takes initiative, he takes pride in what he does, and he does it all with a smile on his face. Imagine that. Guy's a go-getter. He doesn't wait around for permission. Hey. Hey, buddy. Got about eight hours left. Should we play some board games or charades or... Hey, are you even listening to me, buddy? Do you not hear me? [tense music playing] Wh-What should we do for the next eight hours or so? Huh? Hey, excuse me, can I talk to you for a second? Stop! I can't let you. [man] Shit! Shit! This is on you. Not me. This is on you. You break into my house and it's somehow my fault? - That's what you're saying? - Why would you do that? [husband exhales] I don't know. He doesn't live here. We don't know him. Uh, I'm tired of looking at his face. Um… he has so many bright ideas, maybe he decides he wants to tie us both to a fucking orange tree, babe. We don't know what he's going to do... I would've left! I don't believe him. But my main priority is to my wife, okay? [laughs] Main priority? You did something that jeopardized me and him and him. - [husband groans] - All of us. You-You chose for all of us. Okay. So, what are you suggesting? That in that split second that it took for me to scribble down this note that I lean over and-and consult with you? No, because you've never involved me in any decision you've made. What made this any different? So, i-it's back to this. I'm just a piece of shit, right? I'm a piece of shit. I'm just a piece of shit. I-I make one calculated risk to try and protect us... Yeah. And how'd that work out for you? The fuck is happening here? Just hang tight, okay? This will be over in a few hours. What happens in a few hours? He takes a lot of my money. I'm so sorry. [tense music playing] [sighs] Why do we keep pretending that this guy is an actual threat? [breathing heavily] I'm going to leave now. Hey! No, no, no, no. Sit back down on the couch. Hey. We're all tired. I'm being nice to you right now. Sit down. What is this, really? Hmm? Do you wanna be me? Is that it? Because let me fucking tell you, it's not all it's cracked up to be. Try being a rich white guy these days. Everyone always thinks it must be real fucking nice. That's what you think, right? But you have no idea what I deal with every day. There's a fucking permanent target on my back, and infinite nothing people out there just waiting for me to fail. Fucking sucks! It's fucking pathetic. Th-That's you, right? You're pathetic. Just leave him alone. [husband] What? Just leave him alone. Leave him alone? This guy? I've had to hold his hand for the last 36 hours and help him rob me. Why? Why? Fucking why am I doing this? Enough! He just wanted to know what it was like to have a little power in his fucking meaningless existence. Oh, I just... I don't buy it. You can't even act it. It's really sad. So… - I'm going to walk out the door. - Sit on the fucking couch now. [menacing music playing] [husband chuckling] I just... I don't believe you. I don't think you're going to do it. I don't think you're going to do it now. I don't think you're going to do anything. Ever. In your entire fucking life. Because… - You listening? - Just sit down on the fucking couch! [husband] You listening? Yeah? You're nothing. You hear that? Say it. Nothing. Nothing. [gunshot] [intense music playing] - [man] Hey! - [wife gasps] Oh, fuck! - [glass shatters] - [gardener gurgles wetly] [gardener groaning, struggling] Oh! - [husband Oh, shit! Oh! - [man] No, no, no, no. No. - [man] He's… - [panting] [husband] Oh! [husband groans] Oh, shit! No. No, no, no, no. Fuck! - Okay. Okay. Oh, my God. Just don't move. - [husband] Not fucking real. Not real. Not real. It's not real. - It's not real. - Do something! What? What? What? I don't know! Just help me, please! Come on, goddamn it! Why would you run through a glass fucking door? No, no, no! Please! - Hey, fucking help me! - What the fuck do you want me to do? Fuck! The guy's fucking dead. [somber music playing] [breathing heavily] [whimpering] What happened was an accident. It was a terrible thing. And I know that you're feeling the weight of it. We all are. But there's a… a huge difference between what just happened and what you think you have to do next. Please don't cross that line. I-I-I can call someone right now that handles this sort of thing. I can fix a problem like this. I can call someone right now. - Let me call someone. Let me call someone. - Hey. Hey. Look at me. Look at me. You're a good person. I know. I know that you're a good person. But there's a step that you haven't taken yet, and if you do, you'll never be the same again. Trust me. You're not a killer. [insects chirruping] [somber music continues] - [gravel crunching] - [vehicle approaching] [bag clatters] [car door closes] [car departing] Money's here. What are you doing? You're going. [breathing heavily] [suspenseful music playing] [coughs] [grunts] [panting] [suspenseful music rising] [gasps] [music fades away] [insects chirping] [husband] Babe? Babe? You okay in there? Hello? We're going to get out of here and then we'll go wherever you want, babe. We'll start over. We could go to the vineyard and renew our vows. How 'bout that, huh? You like that? It's gonna be okay. - Hello? - [footsteps approaching] [husband] Nothing? Goodbye. [wife] It was a rose. I'm sorry, what? My tattoo. It was a rose. And I liked it. I don't give a fuck. [husband groaning] [husband] Hey, hey, hey. Hey! [tense music plays] You were right. I wanted to know what it would feel like to be you, and so I came here. And then you showed up. And deep down, I really wanted you to be good, because then at least things might make sense. Life might feel more fair. And then I saw you, the real you, and you're so disgusting. I feel sick. And nothing feels fair. You have everything, and I have nothing! At least you're alone, though. So I get to have that. Right? I can pity you. You're always gonna be alone. Because I know something you don't know. She has birth control pills in her purse. [gasps softly] [chuckling] [tense music continues] [wife grunts] [panting] [man choking and gurgling] [screams] Babe? Babe? Are you okay? - [loud thud] - [wife grunts] [husband] Fuck was that? The fuck just happened? Huh? Babe! [wife whimpers] [husband] Babe? Hey! Are you okay? What happened? Hey, babe! Did you just fucking kill him? You just fucking killed him. Didn't you? [laughing] Holy shit, babe! Oh, my God. You fucking did! Oh, my God! Holy shit! Untie me. Baby, what are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? Untie me! Hey, come on! What the fuck? Are you gonna shoot me? [gunshots] [gunshot] [desolate music plays] [somber music rises] [exhales] [moody instrumental music plays]
