Come on, Siggi. Jens? Is it something from the capital? I'm going to the moat. [seagulls squawking] [footsteps sloshing in mud] - Jens. - Max. It's missing a bit of anger, wouldn't you say? You're required to read this. It's all quite clear, Jens. Except for the signature, which is illegible. They've got a lot to sign. Ban on painting, ban on working. Ban on eating, ban on drinking. Such things cannot be signed legibly. The ban goes into effect upon delivery. Yes, that's what it says. This wasn't my idea. I just deliver it. The ban is issued and in force. Yes, but... only in the capital, Jens. I've been charged with enforcing the new ban. I'm nearest to the scene. POLICE STATION RUGBÜLL - Not that. - They say the paintings are sick. No, not my picture! Don't you dare! Here, take it to my office. Go on! [door closes] [wind howling] [water lapping] [seagulls squawking] [footsteps rustling] [gasps] [both laughing] [distant clinking] [whispers] - Father said something about sick paintings.

[thunder cracks] [rain pouring down] [thunder rumbling] Hey! - What's it called? - "Laughing Seagulls on Duty." [chuckles] But you're not allowed to paint. [banging on door] Open up! Open the door! [door creaks open] [rain pouring down] [thunder rumbling] Siggi! Down with your pants. Bend over. [door squeaks closed] - [cane whips] - [gasps] [distant footsteps pacing] [breathes heavily] [cane whips] [grunts in pain] Turn around. [cane whips] [grunts in pain] What do you have to say for yourself? I have to be home when there's a thunderstorm. Your mother demands it of you, and so do I. You are at home when there's a storm at night! A useful person must do what he's told, my boy. We'll make something useful out of you. Has the painter been doing any work? I asked you a question. Was he painting? Seagulls. He painted seagulls. Seagulls? And every seagull looked like you. We're going to work together, Siggi. Nobody's a match for the two of us. Not even him. You'll work with me, and I'll make something useful out of you. [dramatic music builds] ♪♪ ♪♪ [dramatic music continues] ♪♪ Oh, Siggi. Does your father know that you're here? Mm-mm. They think painting is dangerous. They think... That I am dangerous, Siggi. Me! Shall we paint together? Hmm? - Mm-hmm. - But you can't tell anyone. Will you promise that to me? Here it is. All right, then. This is for the contours. And then we'll do the colors. Where have the people gone? Are they dead? Certainly not. [stick breaks] [both gasp] [laughing] Your father can't harm me, Siggi. I'm not painting. [brakes squeaking] You were at the painter's place for quite a while. Did he paint? - No. - What did you do the whole time? - I painted. - And what did the painter do? He taught me. What did he teach you? How to paint pain. You're supposed to watch him. But you are not allowed to paint, Siggi. [glass breaks] [light cello music] ♪♪ [wind howls] Hilke? Siggi. Where have the people from the empty house gone? Why do you ask? Where have they gone? Somewhere nicer than here. Where's that supposed to be? Where it's nicer? Push harder, Siggi. [gasps in pain] Max, Ditte said the people you've spent all these years with are the ones you should celebrate your birthday with. And... We residents of Glüserup have to stick together. The foolishness we used to get up to, right, Jens? The two of us got into all sorts of shenanigans. And we both had an eye on your Gudrun back then, remember? You chose him even though I painted you in the most beautiful colors. But you were a different caliber. Young, handsome, strong. Your marriage produced three children who are very dear to me. Klaas, your oldest, who is out there, serving the Fatherland. Our pretty Hilke. And of course Siggi, my godson. But don't misconstrue my remark about Gudrun. That was before Ditte, my wonderful singer from Flensburg, who gave up everything for me. Her occupation, the concerts. Ditte is the woman whom I love. And not only for her baking. [all laughing] You've been at my side for 20 years now. And I thank you for putting up with me. Still. And especially now. Oh... Thank you for coming and celebrating with this old geezer. Cheers! - Cheers! - To your health. Cheers! I prefer to let Max speak. He's better at it. But today I think I should say a few words. Max, when I first saw your paintings, I was so... Moved. I thought, I want him and nobody else. And for you, I gladly gave up my singing. No need to be so modest. You are a great painter. One of the greatest of our time. And you come from Glüserup. And you are a kind-hearted person, but all of you know that. Max is not someone who would watch a person drown. No, he wouldn't do that. And that's why my wish for you is that none of us will ever let you drown if you ever fall into the cold water. So you may continue to speak to us through your paintings. [all clapping] [glasses clink] Max, I've also thought of something special for your birthday. Do you remember, Jens, when we were young? I think that today we should sing together again. You know, our song. - Would you, please? - Jens. Father, sing along, please.

I'll tell you something. Sometimes you have to go against your duty! You want me to violate my duty! Did you all hear that? - Do you understand what he just said? - Jens. You were ten when you were playing on the floodgates. What happened when you fell in the water? Who put his life on the line to save you? At some point we have to be even!

I don't want you to leave! I want you to stay here! I don't want to be alone with father! [door lock clicking] This is Mr. Jepsen, whom we spoke of. Siggi, tell the gentlemen what the topic of the composition was. - The Joys of Duty. - The Joys of Duty. When I asked him why he had not written a single line, he told me it was because he had too much to tell. There were too many overlapping images, and he could not find a beginning. I assigned a composition as punishment. I would refer to it as a final act of compliance, with which inmate Jepsen conducted his work. But see for yourself. - Confabulation. - Mnemonic verification. This is very clear. Siggi... You have now realized that German compositions must be written. That realization was our aim, not punishment. You may return to regular detention. That... That is very generous... But I must continue to write. I am satisfied with your efforts so far. We can waive the rest. Gentlemen, we have to move on. The Joys of Duty... I'd like to understand them, in full. I must finish writing the story, please! To whom are you telling it all? To myself. [door slams shut] Bring him some water, he reeks.

He would've gotten jail, but he fled. Anyone who helps him is culpable. Listen, Siggi, if Klaas shows up here, you have to report it. Right away. - It's very important. - He won't come here. Where else will he go? Understood? - Have you understood? - Yes, father. Yes. [stirring shaving cream] Where are you going? What is it? Siggi. Put something proper on.

But then I forbade you to draw at the painter's place. Did you obey me? I don't hear anything. Yes. From the moment I forbade you from doing so, you did not draw at the painter's? No. What do you think the painter stated on the mainland? Why they let him go? Why they are laughing at your father? - Do you have an explanation? - Jens...
