MAN: Ava. That's beautiful. That's a name I'll never forget... forget. [GROANS] [CREAKING] [SIGHS] Ugh! Ugh. Fuck! What the hell did you do last night? Oh, God. Where is my Phone? What the...? What is...? Oh, gross. Oh my... Oh... no. At least you remembered to use protection. Gross. Yuck. Nope. You saw the whole thing, didn't you? Didn't you? What are you still doing here? - I tried... - Turnaround! Really? Didn't I see you naked last night... - Turn around! - Okay. Okay, look, last night, whatever it was, I'm sure it was fun, but it was a huge mistake. I don't think your understanding me. I tried to leave, but I was held back before I got to the stairs. That is so sweet that you came back for a second chance... - What? - but I'm not interested in a relationship right now. I am very happy with how my life is right now. So if you are here for some sort of love connection, well, then, you are riding down a lonely one-way street. - Now please, can you leave? - I told you... Look get out of here before I call the cops! [POLICE RADIO CHATTER, HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING] Ah, wow. That was fast? Ma'am, inside! Close the door! Okay. - What was that? - I don't know, - it's your apartment building. - Well, what did he say? I don't know, I was too busy pissing pants. Ma'am, please, for your safety, - close the door. - Yeah, I know, I know, I heard that part. But you see, can he just sneak right past you? Is he holding you against your will? - No, but... - Is he hurting you? - Well, no, but I just... - Please, back inside! Look, listen, I'll be real honest with you, I made a mistake last night, you know, a one-night stand. You know, I just want to put this whole thing behind me and... - [THUD] - Wha..? Oh. Oh. [HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING] Maybe you can make a run for it? Make a run for it? Do you want me to get shot? Well, you can't stay here. - Why? - I don't know you. You could be a serial killer. Actually, you can be the one the cops are looking for. Of course, that's why they pushed you back in here with me. You know, what? Look... - Do you even know my name? - Yeah. I know your name. - Uh, uh... Paco. - Paco? Okay, fine. I don't remember your name. - Paco? - All right, fine! But I get a pass on the name, seeing as how you were trying to sneak out on a girl you just slept with, - without even leaving a note. - What about you? - What about me? - You were pretending to be asleep. - No, I wasn't. - Please, I could have walked a marching band through your room this morning trying to sneak out. Aha! I knew it! So you were trying to sneak out. Aha! So you were pretending to be asleep! - Can I use your phone? - What's wrong with yours? Well, I don't want to use my minutes. - Really? - No, damn it. It's out of battery. It'll be quick. What? Do you have to call your girlfriend? My girlfriend? What are you jealous? Oh, please, don't flatter yourself. Look, I just want to call my brother so he can get me out of this mess. I don't have my phone. - What? - I don't have my phone, okay? I probably left it at the bar or in my car or... oh my God! Did I drive home last night? No, I wouldn't have done that. You probably drove. Which means, you probably put our lives in danger. I didn't have my car last night. - If anything you drove. - Oh, please, I don't text and drive, and I don't drink and drive. Oh, you don't have one-night stands either. No, I don't have one-night st... Oh, very funny. Haha. Where's your TV? - I don't own a TV. - What? - I don't own a TV. - Who doesn't own a TV? My cousin has a 70-inch TV and he's six. I want a TV, I just don't have one yet. My roommate, who moved out, took the TV. Okay? Fine, how about a computer? - Hello? - Alex. Yeah! Who's this? Who's this? Alex, it's me. Oh, ho, ho. Hey, Mikey! Where the hell are you? Don't call me Mikey. Listen, I need your... Did you bang that chick at the bar? How do you know about the girl at the bar? ALEX: You two were pretty cozy when we left. I figured that's the most action you've had in awhile. You left me at the bar? So how many friction fires did you start last night? The what? Alex, I don't want to talk about it. Ha, ha, ha! Ouch! Little Mikey strikes out? No, I didn't strike out. I just don't remember what happened. Wow, you have the liquor tolerance of a hamster. Alex! I'm not fucking around, man! We're stuck inside this apartment because something is going on outside and we can't leave. I need you to see what's going on at... - Waverly Apartments. - Waverly Apartments. Is that the chick? Ah ha! So you did stick it to her? Good for you. She was pretty hot. - Waverly Apartments, Alex! - Jesus! Hold on. Attitude. I'm sorry. He's charming. What is he, your best friend? Big brother. ALEX: Hey, you love birds are on every channel. So what's her name? Wow. I don't believe it. You don't remember my name either. No, I do, I do. It's, um... - Paco? - Great. Bro, you banged a chick and don't remember her name? I'm so proud of you. Come on, I wish I could hug you right now. Hug your monitor. Just hug it for me. - Stay out of this, Alex! - You know what? That's enough. Hi, how are you? Wow. Tell me your name, I promise I won't forget it. Oh yeah, my name is Ava. ALEX: Hi, Ava. - Props brother, mad props! - Okay. Hey, focus! Can you please just tell us what is going on? Hello? Hello? Hey, I don't get it. I think we lost the connection. I think the screen is frozen. I don't know, we lost the connection or something. - What is going on outside? - Oh my God! Hey, your brother is stuck inside me... my apartment, and I would love to get him out of here. So if you could, just, please, tell us what is going on? For a pretty girl like you, anything. Lets see here. Wow, looks like there's a hostage situation. They got the entire building on lockdown. So you two are fucked for a while. Well, okay, locked down? Anything else? What am I, CNN? Alex, are you ready to go? For God's sake, I don't care what kind of cake we get for the wedding, chocolate, vanilla. Who gives a fuck? Does it look like I'm gonna eat it? - Hi, Michael. - Hi, Denise. - Is everything okay? - No. Jesus, woman. Can a man have a conversation with his brother? Yeah, but who is he with? Is he with Jackie? Wow! He's like a big teddy bear... with rabies. Ava? Michael? ALEX: Michael. Michael. Would you quit fondling your fries and eat. I'm not hungry. I'm not paying if you're not gonna eat. I didn't ask you to pay. I'm just saying, money is a little tight. Yeah, I see that. I'm gonna need you to cut this attitude you got going, it's really making me lose my fucking appetite. Is everything okay for you guys? Oh, everything's great, thanks. Can I get another beer, and when you get a chance, can you please ask the chef if he found my brother's balls in the kitchen. Yeah, they're very small. I don't want him to mistake them for like peas, or rice, or something. - I'll see what I can do. - [SIGHS] I'll just have another Diet, thanks. You're such an asshole, you know that? I told you Jackie was trouble. Wow! Where did that come from? I just knew. Okay? It's my job to look out for you, Mikey. Please don't call me that. A woman like that is gonna have you wrapped around her finger. That's the difference between you and me. You're vulnerable. It makes you weak. Being vulnerable makes me weak? Yes. Believe me, I get the intrigue. A woman like that, has been around the block a few times, probably does shit in bed that would shock pornstars. And what happened? You fell in love and let this girl get inside your head. Now look at you. You're like a neutered puppy. Isn't that what happens when you fall in love? - Letting someone in. - But I know who I am. You can't let it trap you. You can't let it mess with who you are, man. Love takes hostages if you let it, bro. - Here. - Thanks. Look, I don't want to see you sitting around like the zombie you've been doing for the past few weeks. I'm gonna be nice enough to let you tag along with me and my friends tonight. - How's that sound? - Your bachelor party? - No, that's all right. - What? You've got other plans? What are you gonna do, sit around, watch "Beaches," eat a pint of ice cream? I don't know who talked Denise into wanting to marry you. I'm your brother, I don't have a choice - but her on the other hand... - You're coming. How's that for a choice? Look, just come and have one drink. Who knows, maybe you'll meet a girl. - What is wrong with this door? - There's an idiot operating it. The stick in the rail, dummy. What are you doing? Anything I can to get the hell out of here. What are you going to jump? Are you crazy? I've done crazier things to get away from a girl. Shocker. But we're three floors up. A minute ago you were okay with me getting gunned down. Now you're worried I'm gonna twist my ankle? Fine, go ahead, break your neck. Hope you have good insurance. [HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING] OFFICER: Police! Don't move! Stay right there! Put your hands on your head! [THUD] Are you done, Evil Knievel? NEWSWOMAN: Yeah, we're still trying to gather some details... Oh, hey, wait a minute. I think I got something. NEWSWOMAN: An alleged gunman entered this apartment complex behind me around 3:00 a.m. this morning believed to have taken some hostages inside one of the units here behind me. And just a moment ago, we saw that alleged gunman that has forced authorities to shutdown Collins Avenue on that balcony right behind me. Yeah, okay. And we want to make a correction there, we are confirming now that that man behind us was actually one of the residents inside the apartment building here behind us. We don't know the condition of any of the hostages. Police are saying that this man is on the run. He is armed and believed to be very dangerous. That's why Local authorities are not taking any risks here. This apartment building is on lockdown. We'll stay on top of these details and bring you the very latest as it develops. Please, by all means, make yourself at home. I'm starving. You have no food. I'm so sorry I didn't go grocery shopping. If I had known that I would've been locked up with you as a hostage, I would have gone out and bought beer and Twinkies. What is all this? Is this even edible? - It's Vegan. - You're Vegan? You have a problem with that? Huh. Whatever. There's a reason we're at the top of the food chain. - Thank God. - Oh, uh, those are stale. They were my roommate's. It's not even opened, Negative Nancy. Sorry. Ah, that's not the best thing to eat on a hangover. You're gonna get sick. I'll be fine, mom. - I told you. - [BELCHES] I could do without the live studio audience, right now. I'll make you something that'll help your stomach. How come you're not throwing up? - I never throw up. - Never? - Nope. - Not even when you're sick? That's included in the "never." You wouldn't happen to have an extra toothbrush, would you? Yes. Actually, it's in the top drawer in the box labeled "toothbrushes for guys I sleep with." A sense of humor. Good to know you have one. There should be some mouthwash in there. And, please make sure you leave the seat down. Thanks. Hello. Yeah. - Ava? - Shit. - You okay? - Yeah. I'm fine. Just... I'll be out there in a minute. Gotta... ahem!... clean. "And her loins quivered as his young, nimble, hands - ran up her mature thighs." - What are you reading? Research? Oh, Ha-ha. Very funny. Hmm. That's my sister's book. Interesting read. I thought you women were more into - "Fifty Shades of Grey"? - No, it's her book. - As in, she wrote it. - No way. - She's a writer? - I wouldn't call that writing. Oh, yeah. I just noticed all the pages and the words written on the pages. - Yeah, it's amateur garbage. - Ouch. Family can be the harshest critics. You know, I don't know you... - Yeah, we've established that. - But, - are you jealous? - What? I mean, you're a writer, aren't you? Yeah, what I am - is none of your business... - Haven't been published? Well, that's just a matter of time... Why would it bother you one bit? Your sister's a writer, you're a writer, she's been published, you haven't. She's my sister, of course, I'm very happy for her. [SCOFFS] - [SNICKERS] - [LAUGHS] WOMAN READING: "Natasha's shirt was torn open by the muscular Brock, revealing her ample but aged breasts. With one cupping, her nipples were erect. Her flower was now soaked. She didn't want to prolong the anticipation, she wanted it fast - and she wanted it furious. - [CROWD GASPS] Brock could feel the carnal sexual frustration and return the favor... - fifty times over. - [GASPS] She thanked her lucky stars the last few hours in which she met this wonderful man and though she'd have to return to solving her sister's murder she knew this moment belonged to her. She tried to take it all in and soon she will be taking - all of him in. - [GASPS] He laid her on the ground, his body molded to hers. Need you now. Her legs wrapped around his waist. His nails dug into her back. 'Take me! Take me! - Take me! Take me!'" - [BOOK DROPS, MIKE FEEDBACK] - [MOUTHING: I'M SORRY.] - MAN: Sit down. Sit down. - Sit down. - I'm so sorry. [CLEARS THROAT] "The propulsion of his manly love muscle inside her aching 'rumpelslitskin' made her toes curl..." [SCOFFS] You know, you didn't have to come. Yeah, I wanted to come, be there for my little sis. - No, you didn't. - Yeah, Of course I did. Oh, save it! Mom told me about your little - meltdown yesterday. - What? Oh, please, don't act all shocked. Okay, well, I wouldn't call that a meltdown. - Oh no, well, what then? - Um, more like, uh, expressing my feelings through - entitled rage. - Entitled? - Are you serious? - Yeah. Kind of. Oh, come on! Writing has always been my thing. It's been what I wanted to do since the 4th grade. You, you wanted to be a, a Las Vegas showgirl, but you don't see me in pasties and tassels. I wanted to be a ballerina, you twat. And I'm not competing with you. You have always been competing with me. - How so? - Oh, well how? Well, let's see, ah, you, you, - you hit puberty before I did... - Kinda not my fault. You kissed a boy before I did, - you lost your, your, your... - Virginity? Yeah! Virginity, that! Now you write a book and publish it before I do. - Come on! - You know, I actually thought that you were gonna be happy for me - like a sister usually is. - I am. I am. I am... not. Sorry. - Unbelievable! - Sure... You know what? You know why I always beat you at this little imaginary competition you have going? Because I'm not trapped in my own insecurities. - That is absolutely not... - What, not, not true? Really? Well, tell me this, where is this amazing book you keep telling me you're writing? Okay, well, obviously with everything that's going on - I haven't been able to fin... - Uh-huh. Wow. I can freaking get in my car, too. Hey! Maybe is time that you faced the fact and just move on. Were you talking about the book? Great! Love you! [TIRES SQUEAL] Fuck this! - Are you trying to poison me? - [LAUGHS] Just drink it. It'll make you feel better. Wow, this actually isn't bad. Mm, and it's Vegan. So, I uh, I guess we just wait this thing out? Yeah, I guess. So who's this roommate of yours? - Does she have a name? - Yes, it's, None Ya Business. Huh. I mean, wow, you two must've really had it out. - She took all your stuff. - Look, um, just because we're stuck in this apartment together doesn't mean that I'm just gonna open up to you and tell you - my life story. - Fair enough. [HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING] - So, you want to have sex? - What? I mean, neither of us remember having it. And there's absolutely nothing to do. And we're completely bored. So, I figured it would be fun. Wow, yeah, when you put it that way. So you see where I'm coming from? [LAUGHS] I am not having sex with you. Why not? I find you somewhat attractive. At least when you're not constantly rolling your eyes at me. And come on, I know you find me attractive. Nope. Come on, we can kill a few minutes. I'm sorry. A few minutes? - I'm not Superman. - Yeah... Clearly. [LAUGHS] You know, maybe it's a good thing we don't remember having sex last night, spared us the inevitable - disappointment. - Disappointment? Your perception of what sex might have been like last night will never match to the reality of the situation. And what is this reality? That sex last night was a mistake and probably a complete disaster. Ugh, and going to that bar last night the worst mistake - I've ever made. - Ugh! Get in line, Ava. At least see the silver lining, you're not alone. - What? - Look. We are not responsible for whatever is happening next door nor do we have any control of the situation. So I'm just saying, at least you're not alone and at least you have me as company. Yeah. Some company. - Was that your first time? - First time what? One-night stand? Uh, Yes. You? - No. - Oh, okay, so you just go to the bars looking to get laid? Oh, come on, isn't that the reason single people - go to bars anyway? - Yeah, of course, good-looking guy, goes to a bar to find a vulnerable... - You think I'm good looking. - Don't change the subject. - Okay, fine, you got me. - God. I actually have a rewards card that I'm filing out with women that I've slept with. I'll go ahead and scratch off one lonely insecure woman and now all I need is a one-legged Brazilian and I can finally get the free sub. Wow, aren't you just the catch of the century. - [LAUGHS] - You know what? Think whatever you want, Paco. I don't really care. And you want to know the truth? I don't even like going to bars. - In fact, I rarely drink. - Oh, please. Being at that bar last night was the last thing I wanted to do. - Yeah? - Yeah. Well, that makes two of us. Two more for table nine. Coming up. Can I get you anything else, darling? My sister at the bottom of a cliff. - What? - No thanks, I'm fine with this. Ugh. You're not seriously gonna sit here all night? - I can just go. - No! Get your fucking mind off her. Look around you. Everybody's having fun. So should you. Define, fun? You see what you're doing right now? The exact fucking opposite. Get wasted, go fuck a random girl, get an STD, I don't know, I don't care. Look around you, there's more ass in here than a donkey ranch. Now go make a fool of yourself and talk to one. The brunette at the bar. No, nah, I'm not gonna go talk to her. What's wrong with her? I'd hit it. - Don't be such a pussy, Mikey. - Don't call me that. - Mikey or Pussy? - Either. Just go talk to her. She's alone at the bar, drinking. I don't know, maybe she's an alcoholic. Oh, maybe. Fish in a barrel, baby. If I go talk to her, then can I leave? Yes, but seriously go talk to her, don't just fucking wave at her like you have tourettes. And then you can go home and hang yourself if you want. 'Cause if I keep seeing you acting like this, I'll fucking hang myself. Forget about her. Go get fucking laid. Can I help you, sir? - Can I get a Roy Rogers? - Seriously? Roy Rogers. Hi. Wrong pipe. Seven dollars. Thank you. Oh, can I get... I'm not gonna get change, am I? [LAUGHS] - I'm Michael. - I don't care. Are you here alone? Yes, and I plan to keep it that way. - Can I buy you a drink. - No, I don't think so. - Come on, just one drink. - No really, I'm fine. Come on, one harmless drink? Look, I don't know you, I don't care to know you. You might actually be a nice guy, I don't know, you seem a little nerdy to me. But if you came over here with the pre-conceived notion that I would accept your drink offer on the off-chance that I would hookup with you, or that I would find your come on's so charming, that I would give you a blowjob in the men's bathroom, well then, I think you might've started a conversation with the wrong girl. Wait. I... um, look, I'm so sorry. I'm, I'm being really rude. - Rough night? - [SIGHS] You have no idea. Look, um, if I let you buy a me a drink, will you leave me alone then? So, my options are to leave you alone, or to buy you a drink and then leave you alone? One more option than you had a minute ago. Okay, tell you what, I'll buy you that drink, because it seems you need one more than I do. And when that drink is finished, I'll decide whether or not I want to keep talking to you. Hah, okay Miguel, one drink. It's... Mike... Forget it. I'm Ava. Ava. That's beautiful. That's a name I'll never forget. What are those cops doing, they're just talking out there. Maybe you should go outside and share your concerns. I'm sure they're taking suggestions. Can't a sniper just take this guy out? Why, you have someplace important to be? Yes, as a matter of fact I do. My brother's wedding is on Sunday. Someone actually wants to marry that oaf? Hey, you can't talk about my brother like that. I can. - You. No. - Sorry. It's okay. He's an asshole. He doesn't even believe in marriage. So then why get married? Pretty girl, half his age, I.Q. of a lamppost. Obeys his every command. His poor fiancée... - The lamppost? - Yeah. She doesn't even realize he's gonna bang half the bridesmaids before the wedding. I take it you're following in your big brother's footsteps. Hey, I am nothing like my brother. Okay? Look. He's always been there for me, and I can't ignore that. We can learn a thing or two from our siblings. He's got a really big heart, unfortunately his mouth is bigger. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. So how much did we drink last night? Pfft. So, you don't remember anything else? Nope. - You? - No. I do remember you not wanting anything to do with me. And you were more than a little guarded. You were having a rough night. Hmm. Try a rough year. Oh? Why? You want my autobiography or something? Come on, we could be stuck here for hours. Do you just want to sit here in silence? Uh, yeah. Considering my head is still spinning that doesn't sound like a bad idea. I don't know, I just, I just didn't want to be here alone last night. So I figured going to a loud bar would be better than sitting here in silence. You go to a bar to not to be alone, yet you want to be left alone? Hmm, the irony that is my life. Well, I'm glad you decided to have drinks with me. Or how ever many... Roy Rogers. Roy Rogers. You were drinking Roy Rogers. - You want another one? - Yeah, sure. - What can I get you guys? - Can I get another Roy Rogers? And whatever she's having. - I'll have another wine. - Yeah, sure. What kind of woman comes to a bar to drink wine? What kind of man comes to a bar to drink a Roy Rogers? A manly one. And by manly you mean, coke and grenadine? - What? - Yeah. A Roy Rogers is a coke and grenadine, kind of like a Shirley Temple. - No, it has alcohol. - No, it doesn't. And you have a vast knowledge of cocktail drinks, how? Because, my ex-boyfriend was a bartender. - That's your ex-boyfriend? - What? No. Hey, excuse me. What's in a Roy Rogers? - Coke and grenadine. - Hah! I've been drinking Cherry Coke? I thought you were the designated driver. Wait, seven bucks? Scotch. On the rocks. - What kind? - Huh? - What type of scotch? - The alcohol kind? [LAUGHS] Give my friend here a Johnny on the rocks with a splash of soda. We don't want him to hurt himself. Oh, actually, I'll have one, too. Don't know much about alcohol, huh? I've never been much of a drinker. I used to date this girl who liked to drink a little too much, kind of put me off. Oh, so no alcohol whatsoever? The occasional beer, socially. Oh, are we being social now? I don't know. So, okay, why scotch then? My dad loved scotch, he had one every night till the day he died. Oh. [CELLPHONE RINGS] - Oh. - What was that? - Sorry. - Oh man, - and you called me a nerd? - Yeah, about that... No, that's okay. You never know, I could be one. Mm-hmm. I am wearing Superman underwear. What? No? No way. - You are? - I don't know. No... Okay. No, no, no, no, it's Okay. I believe you. I believe you. Just keep your pants on. Could you please? - Thanks. - [SIGHS] I feel like I'm in detention. I'm just waiting for Principal Holmes to scream out my name. How come that doesn't surprise me? I bet you spent a lot of time in there. Well, you see there's a balance of clichés in high school. Some of us need to be the popular ones. We can't all be super nerds. I'm right, huh? Probably spent your weekends with your face in a book. Didn't have many boyfriends, did you? - I didn't want one. - Uh-huh. Let me guess. You lost your virginity in college. And when did you lose yours? In Kindergarten? You want to know how many girls I finger painted? - Oh my God, you're revolting. - Revolting? I wasn't the one in the bar looking to get laid last night. I was not looking to get laid. Fine, whatever. You have some unresolved issues. And that's okay. And you? You don't have any issues? I can fill half the books on this bookshelf - with my issues. - Oh, yeah. Self-centered, narcissistic, resentful, let's see, - lack of social skills. - To name a few. Put that down! This is not your apartment. You know what, add lack of manners to your growing list of charming qualities. Was that your book? Yes. As a matter of fact, it is. But if you want, I can find something more at your reading level. How about a pop-up book? Great, maybe I can paper cut myself to death. Stupid. So what's your book about? Romance? Thriller? It's Porn. Plain and simple. I mean, I can't believe she got that garbage published. You know, she didn't even want to be a writer. You know what she was? An escort! True story. Really? What's her number? Not funny. No, she used to want to be a ballerina but when she moved to New York she couldn't find work, so she became a stripper, and then she became an escort. - Thank you for clarifying. - Mm, and now... now she wants to be me. Wouldn't she rather be an escort? And my parents still think she's just this little angel. - Ugh! - Ugh, I'm sensing some jealousy. Now I'm sensing some homicidal thoughts. Why can't I get published? You know, I'm a good writer. I'm a good writer. My books are like interesting and fascinating. - I would read your book. - You would? If it is both interesting and fascinating. If it's only one or the other I won't touch it. I mean, who really wants to read an erotic murder mystery at a... at a Justin Bieber concert? I think my mom bought a copy. You're so... - Whoa. - Oh! Nope, I'm okay. I'm good. I'm good. Hello. Okie dokie. You are insane. "Die Hard 2" is not better than the original "Die Hard." Yes! Are you kidding? "Die Hard" one is considered the standard by which all other action movies are made. The flawed, average guy gets impossible odds. "Die Hard 2" was just a less superior carbon copy of the first. [GIGGLES] You saw something in my teeth? No. You just sound smarter when you're drunk. Is that a compliment? I don't know, action movies nowadays suck. Man, I just can't believe you like action movies. Why? There's nothing wrong with that. No, I know, I know, it's just, you seem more like a "Beaches" or Dirty Dancers kind of girl. - No, "Dancing." - What? "Dancing." "Dirty Dancing." And no way, I would take Willis over Swayze any day. - Me, too. - [LAUGHS] Jackie would never watch action movies. - She called them distasteful. - Who's Jackie? Oh, it's my ex-girlfriend. I mean, fiancée. You were engaged? For about six months. Yes, I was. Until I found out she cheated on me. Oh, that's rough. - Boom. - Wow. Three months salary, huh? And my left kidney. - Ugh. - I'm sorry. - I don't want you to think... - No, no, it's... Why do you still keep that? Because. - You know. - Yeah. - I don't know. - [LAUGHS] You know, eventually you're gonna have to move on. Yeah. You need a shot. Hi. Hi, come here. Can we have two lemon drops, please? I'm sorry guys, it's last call at the bar. - Seriously? - It's been a long day. Two lemon drops? Just two. Please? - Just for you. - Thank you. MAN: Come on. Shit. I gotta get going before... - Get your hands off me. - BARTENDER: Sir. Don't touch the lady. I warned you. Finish your drink and get out. Thank you. - Shit! They fucking left me! - Who? My brother and his dick friends. They're probably at some strip club. Ugh! With my sister! Yeah. AVA: Hey, um, do you want to get out of here? - Together? - Yeah. Yeah? Okay. Drink to that. Oh, really. You weirdo. Get off of me. Oh, God, get off of me! I warned you! My car is across the street. Can you drive? Probably not straight. No. Man. Hey! I don't bite, nena. Nice and clean inside. You need to go someplace? - A little maybe salsa dancing. - Ho, ho, oh my God. Okay, a little more exotic. I take you. - Where do you two want to go? - My place? - We can go to mine. - I'm not too far. - It doesn't matter. - Yours? Yeah, yours. We can go to yours. Okay, okay, okay, conversation in car, okay? - We decide then. - [TWO GUNSHOTS] Oh, shit! Vamos! Vamos! Vamos! We gotta go, we gotta go, que nos matan coño! Oh, shit! 9-1-1! We need a police officer... DISPATCH: All drivers be advised, gunshots reported on Hollywood Blvd. Police are setting up roadblocks. No passengers are to be picked up in the vicinity. Uh, I've haven't done this before. - Oh, we don't have to... - No! I mean, yes. I mean, I want to. Hey, driver, you can take Biscayne to 163rd. Whatever you want, sweetheart. You two just enjoy the ride. If you need anything, just let me know. Name is Francisco. Friends call me Paco. Oh, Paco. Thank you, Paco. Paco. When we get back to my place, uh, I think we should, you know, take it easy. I have rules. - Rules? - Yeah. - What kind of rules? - Rule number one, do you have protection? Check! Oh no, you shouldn't keep those in your wallet. - The heat and friction... - What am I suppose to do? - They don't deliver. - Rule number two, if you're gonna spend the night with me you can't sneak out. I would never. I swear. I would never sneak out. Rule number three. And this one's the most important. I am not looking for a relationship. If you are looking for puppy love, then you should buy a puppy. Fine by me. No relationship. I mean it, I don't even want to talk about relationships. Then let's not talk. Sorry. I'm so sorry. [MOCKING] Let's not talk. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Okay, okay! Straight face! Stop the cab! What's going on now? I can go for a hot dog! Keep the change. Take care, esa nena, papa! Use protection! Protection! What's up? Great day for a hostage gig, huh? Hey, anybody in there? - Psst. - Hello? Over here. Hey, hey, over here. - Sir, please stay inside. - That's what I'm doing. - Look, I'm inside. - Close the door. Look, my girlfriend is very scared in here, and she doesn't handle stress very well. We don't have a TV and we just want to know what's going on outside. You don't have a TV? It's a long story. Could you give us like an ETA? Or maybe order us a pizza or something? Hey, you're the one-night stand couple? - [LAUGHS] - Great, we're famous. Yeah, it is you two. The officers were telling me about you guys. So maybe you can understand why I need to get - the hell out of here. - Oh, no, no, no. You can't leave until this has been resolved. Why not? You're a lot safer just staying inside and don't open the door to anybody. - I can't be here. - Look, kid. We're doing the best we can. If you want out of here so bad, maybe next time you'll know something about the girl you're hooking up with. Good luck. [LAUGHS] - Hey, what did he say? - We're shit out of luck. - He said that? - I'm paraphrasing. - [RINGING] - Ugh, it's your brother. [GROANS] - [COMPUTER BEEPING] - What was that? - What? - You just declined his call. Yeah, I figured he's the last person we should be talking to right now. You figured? You figured I didn't want to talk to him? Okay, Michael, he didn't exactly enhance the situation last time you were on the phone with him. - It all makes sense now! - And what's that? Why your roommate packed her bags and got the hell out. - I understand completely. - Excuse me? If I would've known how manipulative you were, I would've never bought you that first drink. You're not fooling me with this little act you put on. Oh, I would never have a guy up to my apartment. Give me a fucking break! You play with people feelings and then in the end she just grabs my heart and destroys it. She? - Why am I here? - What? Why... why am I here? - Obviously we're trapped here. - No! Why did you invite me up to your apartment? I, I don't remember! Were you so desperate for company that you would've slept with the first guy who made you feel special? Why? Because everyone else leaves you? Even your roommate couldn't stand you. Your stupid vegan food, your critiquing of everything, your zero self-esteem. I am this close to jumping out the window! Good! Maybe you should, you jerk. God, you'd be better off dead than left here with me, just like Kevin. Kevin? Oh my God, this tastes so good! Mm. You never had a hot dog? - None in six years. - Really? I'm vegan. Aren't hot dogs one of the seven vegan mortal sins? Oh, yeah. Are you gonna finish that? - [CELLPHONE VIBRATING] - Oh my God, look over there. - [CHUCKLES] - Oh my God. I miss meat so much. So what's it like, being vegan? What's that suppose to mean? - It's not like I have herpes. - Herpes? - [sirens blaring - Oh My God, No! I mean, like, being ve... oh God, no, no one has herpes. Wait, do you? - No. - Then it should be fine. It should be okay, right? - That you're vegan? - Yeah. - Oh, I don't care. - Oh. I've had relationships end because of my choice in dietary lifestyle. - Haaah. - Rule number one. - Don't talk about "Fight Club." - Not... relationships! - No talking about them. - You brought it up. And I am taking it back. Those are the rules, and I'm sticking to them. You're making this up as you go. - Fine, no relationships. - Mm-hmm. But I don't see how anybody wouldn't want be with you. I find you fascinating. A vegan writer who likes action movies... - I'd marry you tomorrow. - Awe, you would? Abso-fucking-lutley. - Tell that to Kevin. - Who the hell is Kevin? Oh, um... my ex-boyfriend. I came home a few weeks ago and he was gone. He even took my TV! Wow. What a tool. Yes. Yes, he is a tool. I don't know, I guess we've both been pretty screwed with relationships. Yep. How about we get a drink? To forget about being screwed. Wait, do you think that's a good idea? We're both pretty drunk. Okay. Wait, no, no, no. You get, get one. - All right. - Yeah. - Oh, will you get me one, too? - [IMITATES GUNFIRE] [CELLPHONE VIBRATES] - Who's this? - [PHONE BEEPS] Michael, it's Jackie. I know you're probably still mad at me and I should've called sooner. You are such a great guy and never gave me a dull moment in bed. You always kept me on my toes... Oh, man. JACKIE: ...literally. Anyways, I'm very sorry for what I did to you. I hope you can forgive me, and if we can talk like mature adults... Beers! I hope you like beer! Oh yeah, that's fine. - Ava, I have been thinking. - Yeah? - And I've decided... - Decided? that I do want to keep talking to you. - Aahh. - Cheers, Michael. - To better love ahead. - Abso-fucking-lutely! - [HICCUPS] - Whoa, are you okay? I'm not feeling so good. - Are you gonna throw up? - No! Oh my God, no I never, never... So much for never. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I think that's it. Oh God! It looks like oatmeal. - Ugh. - Are you okay? - No, I just get... - Look away and breathe. - [GAGS] - Breathe, breathe. Ugh, well, I'm having fun. Maybe I should get you home. What? No! Let's not let a little throwup ruin the night. - [LAUGHS] - Where do you want to go next? I don't know. - Thank you. - Oh, it's squishy. Ugh, you stepped in puke. Ava? - Ava, look, I'm sorry. - Michael, just, just stay out there and I'll stay in here until this is over. I know what you're going through. Please, Just go away! I was engaged. I was engaged for about six months. Her name's Jackie. We'd been dating for six years. She was, um, perfect. Or at least I thought she was. I don't know what I was thinking when I proposed to her. I lost my dad the year before, and he always liked Jackie. I guess I was being impulsive. I just never thought she'd cheat on me. Alex is right, I'm way too vulnerable. I was about to marry this horrible person. And I can't even find the ring. I think I lost it last night. It doesn't matter. 'Cause you can't fix something that's meant to be broken. Ava, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. [GRUNTS] Hey, you hungry? I think the hostage negotiator guy ordered pizza. [LAUGHS] I came home and all my things were gone. I really thought that he was the one. He was always there for me until... I don't know, I just... I never thought that he would leave. But I know that it's my fault. How is it your fault? I've never been in a relationship where I found myself opening up. Um, I don't do too well when I'm not in control. But then again, here we are, so, go figure. You know, maybe it's not about being in control, maybe it's about opening up... What, being vulnerable? Sorry. No, it's okay, you're right. Speaking of vulnerable. - Is that my ring? - I'm sorry. Oh My God! - Did we get married? - What? No! I just, I saw it in my room, and I was just being so stupid. Your fiancée has really small fingers. Ex-fiancée. I'm really sorry. It's a beautiful ring. You have great taste. Thank you. So why do you still keep it? I don't know. Wishful thinking. So I guess part of me still doesn't want to let go. Holding on to the only thing I've got left. Thanks. - [MIKE FEEDBACK] - Good evening, townspeople. My name is Michael "Shitz"... I mean, Shultz. - And this young lady is... - Drunk! And me and him are gonna have sex later. - I don't care what you say. - BIKER: Yeah! And then she's gonna have sex with me! Hey! And we're gonna double team her. - Double team! - Yeah! Hey! In your dreams, Wild Hog! Any time, baby! Any time. - Come on, baby. - Call me tomorrow. - Thank you, Ava. - You're welcome. - Ava! - Yeah? Moments like this make me feel like I'm living on something. - On What? - On a prayer, Ava. - On a prayer. - Yeah. [MIKE FEEDBACK] Oh, you don't got that one? Give me something else.

We've known each other for less than 24 hours... half of which we don't even remember... so don't act like you know anything about me. You're right. 24 hours is not enough time to know someone. Neither is five years, apparently. And what the hell is that supposed to mean? It means it took you half a decade to realize - that someone didn't love you. - You are such a hypocrite. - It took you just as long. - Yeah? Well, it only took me half a day to realize what kind of woman I really need to love. Yeah, and what kind is that? One that's just as miserable as I am. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Good news.

No. Maybe me and you can go out sometime for a drink? Oh. Oh, oh, right. Uh, you know what, that is just, that's so flattering, but, um, I can't because... I'm an alcoholic. So, take care.

You two have been fighting since you were toddlers. You pulled her hair, you locked the other one in the freezer. Have you guys not been watching the news? No. Why? Did they talk about your sister's book? What? No! Seriously, you guys aren't concern at all that you haven't heard from me in two days? What? Seems normal. Sometimes, what, we go two weeks without hearing from you. Never mind. I'm gonna charge my phone. Oh God, what's wrong? You did not not pay your electricity bill again? What? Again? Sarah is the one who doesn't pay her bills. - I'm right here. - Well, you don't. Look. Okay, why is your phone not charged? - It's called a dead battery! - It's called a dead battery. I left my phone at the bar the other night. The bar? Oh no, Ava, you are not, you are not getting back together with Kevin again, - are you? - What? How many times do we have to tell you, that boy adds nothing to your life. All I'm asking for is for a phone charger. And no, I'm not trying to get back together with Kevin. - That's over. - Okay, mine is in the kitchen. I mean, what kind of man makes a living getting other people drunk? I can do that all by myself for free. Not to mention, talking all night - to other beautiful woman. - It's true. - Mom! Enough. - And God only knows... Okay, seriously, you guys don't know \what's been going on in my apartment building? You know your father watches the TLC. It's just TLC mom. There's no... All right, honey. I'm, I'm sorry, tell me what happened? [DOOR OPENS] [CLOSES] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Michael. Jackie? You look so handsome. You always looked stunning in a suit. You're not gonna give me a hug? Or a kiss hello? What are you doing here? We can both be adults about this. I know things didn't end well between us... Well? Not the way I see it. I mean, I for one love to be cheated on. It gives me this warm fuzzy feeling. I know what I did was terrible. - Did you get my card? - Oh, yeah, the card. How thoughtful. I particularly loved the gift card. I mean, how did you know? Well, I noticed that your sink was leaking, and I thought it would be a nice gesture. Leaking? And when did you notice that? On the way out of our relationship, when you shattered my heart into fucking pieces? Please Michael, if you had listened to my voicemail. I meant every single word. - I still love you. - What voicemail? The one I left you the other night. I didn't get any voicemail. You know what, it doesn't matter. Look. I woke up thinking about you and about what a terrible mistake I made. You're just such a nice guy, Michael. But marriage isn't exactly on my bucket list. But you, you are such an amazing man, and any girl out there would be so lucky... Wait. After 5 years, you cheat on me. I don't hear from you for weeks and you leave me a voicemail and a card that says "Hey, I'm leaving you, Michael. And by the way, your fucking sink is leaking"? Yeah, I still want us to be friends. Oh, friends, right. Sure. How about we go bowling? Sure. Whatever you want. No! I don't want to be your friend. I wanted... I wanted you to be my wife. I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you. It was... it was a beautiful ring, Michael. The ring? It was a beautiful ring. It was beautiful when I bought it, and it was beautiful when you took it off. - But it is gone now. - What do you mean, gone? Oh, I flushed it! And I hope it's in some vile sewer covered in shit and egg and piss and hair and everything else disgusting that reminds me of you. Why did you do it? Will you ever forgive me? I miss you. Good-bye Jackie. You got ruffied! Oh my God, he ruffied you! No, he didn't ruffie me. How do you even know what a ruffie is? I saw it on "Law & Order." Detective Stabler went undercover. - He was in a... - No. Mom. Mom, mom. - Michael was a gentleman. - Oh! No, really, he was a nice guy. Well, Ava, I sure hope you used protection. - Oh, God, no. - That is disgusting, mom. Oh, you think you're the only girl who ever had a one-night stand? Oh, well. Well, I need a refill. - Anybody else wants a drink? - No, God. Well, more for me. You really don't remember anything from the other night? I mean, bits and pieces are coming back to me. And the man, that you were stuck with? Michael? More of like a lost puppy. - You like him? - What? The aloof, charming, good-looking guy that you can't stop smiling about. Well, he is very good-looking. Um, hey listen, about the other night... Oh, stop, you... I don't... we don't have to talk about it. - Yes, we do. - No, it's fine. I'm so sorry. I know that you've been working on your writing and I just... Is that you apologizing? Ugh, you were right. I'm so sorry, these past few months, they haven't been the best for me. And just because you're successful, doesn't mean I shouldn't be happy for you. You deserve it. - Really? - Yes, really. Oh, actually, I have something for you. Here. - Is this... - Yeah. Uh-huh. Since you made it to the shelves before I did, um, maybe you can give me a few pointers? Wow, this guy really did a number on you. Oh My God, okay, fine. Yes, I can't stop thinking about him. But, I mean, I, I don't... I didn't get his last name or his phone number. Maybe he has yours. Well, you didn't take his but maybe he has yours and you just don't remember. - Have you checked your phone? - No, it's charging. Have you turned it on. - Anything? - It's turning on. - [VIBRATING] - Oh, ended. [LAUGHS] - Is that him? - Mm-hmm. - He's cute. - Told you. Yummy, yummy. So, are you gonna call him? - What? - Call him. [BEEP] What? Why would you... My God... God, you are... [VIBRATING] Oh, voicemail. Hi Michael, it's me... Paco. Um, sorry, it's, uh, Ava. Anyway, I just got the picture that you sent. And, yeah, I guess there is proof that the other night actually happened. Um, anyway, you know, I was thinking, I know this sounds crazy, I mean, we met under some pretty crazy circumstances, but, ah, you know, actually I can't stop thinking about it. [SIGHS] You know, I don't even know your last name, so I was thinking... - Get your ass in here. - The men's room? Oh, I like your style. Dangerous! What the hell are you doing here? I was invited. Plus one. Yeah, well, you uninvited yourself when you went ahead and told Michael you had slept with someone. Relax, I didn't tell him it was you. Now, how about a wedding present? You know I'm getting married in like 18 minutes. Aww. That's so sweet. But does that little kitty know how to hunt like a panther? Ooh, that's my spot. That's my spot. Gotcha. Oh, Baby, baby, baby, just hold on for a week. When I get back from my honeymoon, I'm gonna need a vacation from my vacation. Maybe you can hunt then. Mm... I want to hunt now. You do want to hunt? Mm-hmm. Oh, right, yeah, turn, oh... Mikey. What's wrong? You still thinking about your cellmate? - What was her name again? - Ava. Her name is Ava. Wow, this Ava must've been something else, huh? Don't let it get to you, baby brother. Girls like that are like fountain coins, they're just laying there, waiting to be picked. But I would never steal from the fountain. Hey, ladies! Let's go. All right. What the hell are you talking about? Mikey? What's gotten into you? Come on, let's get this wedding business over with and get to the reception. I heard the band singer got a set of Medusa titties. As soon as you stare at them your dick turns to stone. Come on! OFFICIANT: Please be seated.

I trusted you. - What is he talking about? - Nothing, baby, nothing. Look Mikey, I knew she was trouble. - I did you a solid! - A solid? Are you insane? Now you know what kind of messed-up girl - she really is. - Girl? What girl? No, now I know what kind of brother you really are. Come on, Mikey. You know I'm always looking out for you, bro. I never needed you to look out for me! And, by the way, here's my wedding gift.
