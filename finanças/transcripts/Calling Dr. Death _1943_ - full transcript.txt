This is the Inner Sanctum. A strange, fantastic world controlled by a mass of living, pulsating flesh, the mind. It destroys, distorts, creates monsters, commits murder. Yes. Even you, without knowing, can commit murder. [ticking] STEELE: Sleep. Sleep. Relax. You're tired. Very tired. Relax. Sleep. She's asleep now, Doctor. Listen to me. Listen closely. You can speak. You will speak. Speak. Frank. [EXCLAIMS] She spoke. She said something. Who is Frank? He is no good. I'm not interested in his character. Who is he? Marion fell in love with him. He was a bad influence. We forced them to separate. She took the automobile. They said she drank... Marion never drank. And then there was the accident. From then on, she hasn't said a word. She's a victim of voluntary paralysis. It's not uncommon. Get her and the boy together, and I'm sure she will soon speak. But I told you he was no good. He's a bad influence. Perhaps he is, but at the moment he's the only cure. It seems impossible. This girl loves that boy. Let her settle her own problems. Don't you see that in order to hurt you she's hurt herself? You're very fortunate. I've known cases, many of them, one quite recently, where the girl despised her mother, wanted to kill her. She couldn't, so she killed herself instead. You might call that murder indirectly. This is a milder form. I'd advise you to bring them together. All right, Marion, wake up. How do you feel, Marion? Come on, clear. I'll expect to hear from you sometime next week. It's all right. It's all right. Neurology. Neurology. The results are beyond imagination. To penetrate man 's mind. intrigues me more and more. Even after eight years of practice, it's still fascinating. And there '5 satisfaction in being successful. Successful? Yes, with everyone but myself. My personal life is a failure. After two years of marriage to Maria, it's no go. We were terribly in love from the moment we met. At least I was. She certainly fooled me. So beautiful. She wore a perfect mask. I couldn't see beyond it. Dr. Mark Steele, eminent neurologist, can't read his own wife's mind. Everybody else could. Everybody else did. Even Stella knows it. She probably knew it the day I married Maria. Stella 's a fine person. She's not only a nurse, she's my co-worker and confidante. I depend on her more and more. 5 o 'clock. How I wish the hands would never move. My work keeps me occupied, I don 't think of myself. Now I 've got to go home to her. I dread it. But I must face it. It's bad to run away from things you fear. They mustn't be allowed to beat you. Goodnight, Doctor. See you in the morning. Her grip is so firm, her hand so cool, as if she wanted to tell me something. Thank you, Stella. Where is she, Bryant? Mrs. Steele left word that she would be detained. Dining alone. Large table, six empty chairs. One man. No, I 'm not alone. She keeps staring at me all the time. I never understood the modern school of painting. It was a joke to me. But now I begin to respect the man for whom she sat. He has caught one thing in Maria that she was able to hide from me. Those eyes. Mean eyes, selfish. They really portray her soul. [TEARING] [METALLIC CLANKING] [PHONE RINGING] Yes? Dr. Steele? What's wrong? Why, nothing. I merely just called to discuss that Jennings case. I thought we'd better... Why should anything be wrong? Well, it's 3:00, Doctor. Are you sure you're all right? Of course, I'm all right. Oh, I had no idea it was so late, Stella. I'm sorry. I'll see you in the morning. Goodbye. For hours I 've been sitting here, never conscious of the time, and still Maria hasn't returned. I hate her. [CAR APPROACHING] STEELE: Maria. Oh, it's you. What are you doing, spying on me? Well, why don't you say something? Spying. Always spying. Maria, I want to talk to you. You must listen to reason. I know just what you're going to say. You poor fool, do you think I'm stupid? [LAUGHING] Stop it. Stop it! - Stop it! - Take your hands off me! Maria, we can't go on like this. You'd like to get away from me, wouldn't you? But you can't. I like my title. A doctor's wife. I have money, position, and there's nothing you can do about it. No, Doctor, there's nothing you can do. I'm not so sure. Not murder, Doctor. You haven't the courage. [DOOR CLOSES] I wonder. [PARROT SQUAW KING] [GASPS] [SQUAWKING] - Good morning, Doctor. - Good morning, Stella. I'm sorry about that call last night. I didn't realise that it was so late. Oh, I understand. There's something that I have to talk to you about, Stella. I had another row with my wife last night. Why are you telling me this? Because for the first time, Maria made me realise that... Oh, Stella, we're adult. This business of hiding the truth from one another, that's not being honest. But there's nothing we can do about it. No, I guess there isn't. [DOOR CLOSES] Good afternoon, Doctor. I didn't expect you so soon. Bryant, where is Mrs. Steele? I don't know, sir. Where is she? Mrs. Steele said something, I believe, about going away for the weekend. - I'm sorry, Bryant. - That's all right, sir, I understand. [BLOWING] [TRAIN HORN BLOWING] [TYRES SCREECHING] Mark! What are you doing here so early? Oh, just look at yourself. This is a fine way to start the week. The week? Is this Monday? Of course it is. Monday. And I don't even remember coming here. - Mark, are you ill? - I don't know. Something must be wrong. I remember leaving the house Saturday afternoon. From then on, everything is a blank. You've got to help me. I guess I must be ill. Please don't worry, Mark. We'll work this out. Now, you sit right down there, and I'll get you something to fix you up. Go on, sit down. Saturday afternoon. Sunday. Where was I? I 've got to recall. I left the house, got into the car, I drove. Drove. Here, take this. It'll help you. Oh, no, thanks, Stella, I never use them. Maria? Must be. Nothing like this ever happened before. We had an argument and... Stella, do you know that I couldn't even tie my own shoelaces? Bryant had to do it for me. And now all this. Well, I'm calling off your appointments for this morning. You're going to the gym. A good rub and a shower will do you good. No, Stella, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right. Thanks. Mark, there are two men outside. - Detectives. - Detectives? Yes, and I don't think it's a professional call. Well, we'll soon see. Yes, gentlemen? We'd like to see you alone, Doctor. I'm sorry, but Miss Madden is always present at my interviews. - Okay. When did you last see your wife? - What are you talking about? - Murder. - Your wife's been killed. [GASPS] Where is she? When did it happen? At your lodge, sometime during the weekend. Better come along with us, identify the body. I'll be right with you. Won't you be seated? Excuse me. Mark, you mustn't say a word. That's why Stella is so worried. Don 't even know where I was. It's horrible. - Oh, this whole thing, it's ridiculous... - Please do as I say. We'll talk about it later. All right, Stella. She's in the house, Doc. Any statement to make, Doc? Oh, I'm sorry. I'm Inspector Gregg, Doctor. Where is she? She's in the bedroom. STEELE:Must have been quite a struggle. Hello, Doc. You don't remember me. No. I worked at the clinic. Killed with a blunt instrument. Skull crushed. Yeah, acid. Maria '5 face, it's horrible. I can't recognise her. Beautiful Maria. Her mask destroyed. She must have suffered terribly. A button. Doctor. I hope you'll excuse me for questioning you at this time, but it's important. Did she have any enemies that you know of? Why, no. There was a man with her. The gas attendant down the way gave us his description. Do you know who he was? I have no idea. The description resembles you. Pretty messy throwing acid in a woman's face, then killing her. Motive could be jealousy. What do you think, Doctor? I wasn't jealous of my wife! No offence, Doctor, but under the circumstances, wife, strange man, thelodge‚Äù. If you want me for any further questioning, you'll find me at my office. Stella, who? Who could have committed such a terrible crime? Her face! If the motive was robbery, why the acid? No criminal would use... No, only a person with a distorted mind could have done such a thing. The inspector said something about jealousy. Stella, I know he thinks I did it. But that's impossible. I found this near the body. Why didn't you give it to the police? Oh, I don't know. I guess I forgot in the excitement. Wait a minute. This might reveal something. [GASPS] So that's where I 'd been Saturday and Sunday. The debacle in the cabin. I killed Maria. Mark. Mark. It's so clear now. The Shoelaces. My lapse of memory. Maria drove me to it. My subconscious had rebelled. Stella, I killed Maria. Call the police. You can't, Mark. You can't. You can't condemn yourself without a trial. You've got to remember. Think, Mark, think. Where did you go when you left the house Saturday? I can't remember. I can't remember. Those two days are a total blank. [PHONE RINGING] I'll get it. Hello? Yes. You've... Oh, but that's impossible. What happened, Mark? They found the man who murdered Maria. Yes, Inspector, I'll be right down. Goodbye. I'm so happy. It doesn't seem true. They've captured the man. To think that I had almost condemned myself. It's such a relief. But the button, how did it get there? So that's the accused man. Robert Duval, the architect. Looks like the man I saw Maria kiss that night in the car. His features are strong and clean. He doesn't look at all like a criminal. It's hard to believe. Dr. Steele, you've got to believe me, I didn't kill Maria. I loved her. Maria and I were very much in love with each other, I thought. There's nothing in the world I wouldn't do for her. Then, suddenly she began to lie, to lead me on. She said that she was going to leave you. I believed her. And then, out at the cabin, it turned out to be another one of her lies. She admitted that she loved me, but she refused to give up her security, her position in society. She was drunk. We quarrelled, and I left. And that was the last I saw of her. After that, I drove all night. The police didn't believe me. I had no proof. They won't give me a chance, Dr. Steele. You've got to help me. I believe you. Duval, as an individual, I'm not interested in you. But as a human being, I feel it my duty to help you. All right, Duval. I agree with you, Doctor. I don't think Duval is guilty, enhen You know what I think? What? I think you killed your wife. How could you do it? Maria was so beautiful. You robbed her of her life. You knew my wife? Now, Doctor, how would I know your wife? STELLA: I'm sorry, but he's busy. You'll have to make an appointment. MRS. DUVAL: I've got to see him. I'll call you when he's free. Please. If you give me your number, Mrs. Duval, perhaps tomorrow. Never mind. - What is it, Miss Madden? - Are you Dr. Steele? This is Mrs. Duval, Doctor. I told her you were busy, that I'd make an appointment. Doctor, I've got to see you. Why, of course. Now, Mrs. Duval. Dr. Steele, I had to talk to you. There was... That'll be all, Miss Madden. I'll ring ifl need you. Doctor, you've got to help my husband. He told me he talked to you. He isn't guilty. I know he isn't. I swear it. I had to talk to someone. I'm alone. You don't know what it means to... Go on now. Tell me all about yourself. We'd been married happily 10 years. Then he came to me one day and told me he didn't love me anymore. There was a woman. He wouldn't tell me who she was. He wanted to marry her. I couldn't give him up, Dr. Steele. I thought he'd get over it. He didn't. He started out of the house, Iran after him. When I got to the head of the stairs, I stumbled. When I woke up, I was in the hospital, paralysed. I've been this way for a year now. Bob and I were miserable. Saturday, we talked things over. He told me he was going to the woman. Dr. Willard, my physician, had told me the day before I wouldn't walk again. I didn't want to ruin Bob's life, having to wheel me around like a baby. So I told him he could do as he pleased. Then he came over and kissed me for the first time in a long while. He left and... The next thing I knew, he'd been accused of murder. Oh, Dr. Steele, you've got to help us. When this is all over, we'll be happy again. Just the two of us. Oh, I know I'm not as beautiful as your wife, but... Mrs. Duval, I understand what you've been through. And I promise that I'll do everything in my power to help you. Dr. Steele, you don't know what he means to me. He's all I've got. I know. You have my word. Thank you, Dr. Steele. I'll call you in a day or two. Miss Madden. It was a pure case of circumstantial evidence. Duval didn't have a chance. There are only two of us. I 'm certain he's innocent. That leaves me the guilty one. MARIA: Not murder. You haven 't the courage. DUVAL: I didn't kill Maria. I didn't kill Maria. I didn't kill Maria. - Not murder. - I didn't kill Maria. I didn't kill Maria. I didn't kill Maria. Stop it! Stop it! GREGG: What's the matter, Doctor? Nerves or conscience? What are you doing here? Oh, I had a hunch. I believe if you follow a guilty man long enough, no matter how he tries, or where he hides, he's bound to break. Why don't you confess? I don't know what you mean. Oh, you don't, huh? You've always experimented with life, Doctor. You've gone beyond life, into the brain, the subconscious. Pretty dangerous invading the unknown. You learn strange things. You think of strange things. I understand you even do. Exactly what do you mean? An innocent man is going to die, Doctor. Oh, you'll confess sooner or later, because you can't escape your conscience. Already, it's beginning to bother you. Why don't you confess now? You're mad. Mad? No. No, Doctor. Did it ever occur to you that perhaps you are? No. Everybody else is. That's what all of you think. You know, Doctor, it isn't death that frightens men. It's waiting. Anticipation. Your conscience haunting you in your sleep, in your dreams. Get out! It's so easy. Just a few little words. That's all it'd take. Get out! [CRASHING] Sorry, Doctor. Was it expensive? Must be your nerves. I'd check that. I 've got to find out. Self-hypnosis. Yes. That's the only way. I'll attempt to put myself under. If I succeed, you start the recorder, then question me about what happened from Saturday afternoon on. Keep repeating and repeating until I reply. Understand? [TICKING] Relax. Relax. I 'm tired. Very tired. My eyes are getting heavy. I 'm going to sleep. Going to... You're completely relaxed. It's all so clear. Think now, Mark. You drove. Then what happened? Who are you? Inspector Gregg. You must have heard of me. Hasn't the Doctor told you? Please, he's asleep. Using his own medicine? He didn't do it. Please believe me. We have proof. Wait a minute, I'll wake him. You're sending an innocent man to the chair. You know the Doctor killed his wife. You know how he hated her. You like him, don't you? But you'll never be happy with him. You'll despise him after a while, and Duval will always loom up before you. Tell me what you know. He's innocent. I know he is. Mark, wake up. Mark! What are you doing here? How did you get in? He's trying to blame you. He wants me to help him. Don't try to fight it, Doctor. It has to come. Don't listen to him, Mark. You didn't do it. You told me so yourself. It's on the recording. I told you what happened last Saturday and Sunday? Yes. STEELE ON TAPE: I got into the car, drove directly to the lodge. I found Maria there. She was alone. She was drunk. She accused me of following her. We argued. I pushed her away, ran out. As I got into my car, through the rearview mirror, I saw Duval enter the house. He must have hidden behind the tree when he first heard my approach. Disgusted, I drove back to my office, took a sedative, a little too strong. I began to fall asleep then... Very interesting. What does it prove? You saw the condition he was in when he made the recording. He hypnotised himself. I helped him. Maybe you helped him get rid of his wife. Leave her out of this, or I'll... What - kill me? No. That isn't the solution. Why didn't you tell me you were at the lodge? I didn't know it. Amnesia, Doctor? Yes, I found him here, asleep, the next morning. Very convenient, but hardly probable. However, this interests me. You'd call that a subconscious voice, Doctor? - Does it always tell the truth? - Invariably. You see, Doctor, I disagree with you. And I'll tell you why. You don't want to die for more reasons than one. I believe in the will to live, and you want to live. You're well-trained, Doctor. I also believe you can control the subconscious. No, I'm afraid you haven't got a chance. Oh, I owe you a vote of thanks, though. You're big game, Doctor. Makes the chase interesting. He's mad. Perhaps, but not without reason. - But the record. - I know. But the will to live, it might be strong enough to control the subconscious. Stella, I'm afraid he may be right. Duval, you've been hiding something from me. You've got to tell me the truth. Everything. Everything that you know. How did you meet Maria? What were the circumstances? All right. I'd been rather successful. Then I began to gamble. I lost everything, everything I built up. Fifteen years of success went overnight. Then I met Maria. I didn't pay much attention to her until your name was mentioned. Then it suddenly dawned on me how successful you'd been. Go ahead. Maria didn't mean anything to me. I was desperate for money. I'd have done anything. We went out together a few times, and then when I was sure of her, I told her I was in trouble. It wasn't hard. In a few months she'd given me $10,000. I thought after I got the money that I'd leave her, but it wasn't that simple. She got under my skin. I kept away from her for a few days, and then I realised I loved her. Did you return the money? Half of it. What about the rest? How about the rest? He is obviously shielding someone. But who? His wife? "Governor denies Duval reprieve. "Duval must die." [GLASS SHATTERING] Stella. Here. Here now. I'm sorry. I... Stella, you've been working too hard. You must take a rest. I don't want to go away, I want to be with you. We'll be together the rest of our lives if... Oh, you need a rest. You've been doing too much. You've been my nurse, secretary, bookkeeper, that is too much. Now, please. Calla girl to take care of the office. As a nurse, I'm afraid I couldn't replace you. Thank you, Doctor. I'll have a girl here Monday morning. That's fine. You know, I've been tired, too. Thought maybe we'd close up the office for a few days and take a run up to Spring Lake. They have excellent fishing, boating, fresh air. I'd love to, Mark, but I promised to visit my family. I haven't seen them in months. They live in Malcolm Falls, about 70 miles above Spring Lake. Well, that's perfect. I'll drive you up to Malcolm Falls, leave you there, then I'll come back to Spring Lake for some fishing. You can return by train, and I'll see you here on Monday. - How about it? - All right. Bill, what happened here? I was coming down the hallway, Doctor. There was a blast. Good thing I was there. There was a couple investigators here. - Investigators? - Yeah. They asked me a whole lot of questions about you. I told them you was okay. Thanks, Bill. Say, you're lucky, Doctor. A few minutes more and all that stuff would have been gone. GREGG: I hope you're insured, Doctor. I'm not in the habit of running after fires, but when they told me at headquarters it was here, naturally, I was interested. - Think you'll need me? - No. Mind ifl have a look around? The investigators have already done that. Well, I feel, especially in a case like this, that everything is a clue. Nothing must be overlooked. Thank you. Doctor, just a minute. Here's something might interest you. You see, I wasn't wrong. And the most innocent thing. Acid. Oh, by the way, wasn't your wife disfigured by... Sorry, Doctor. Now, this particular... Strange that it should occur to you twice. Acid, I mean. Peculiar place for a chemical, don't you think, Doctor? - Very clever. - Are you insinuating... Why not? Perhaps you had something to hide. Well, it was a pretty good fire. Looks like it took a long while to get started. Where were you the last few hours? On my way back from Spring Lake. And when the train stopped, you got out and made a long-distance telephone call to yourself. Vibration of the telephone bell upset the acid, causing it to fall. And your little gadget did the rest. I hate to disillusion you, Inspector, but I drove back. Besides, why would I want to burn my own office? May I repeat myself? Perhaps you had something to hide. Mark! - Mark, what happened? - Just a little fire. Are you all right? You're not hurt? Of course I'm all right. There's nothing to worry about. Is your office all right? Yes. The fire didn't get in there. Oh, I'm glad. - Were you out of town, too? - What's that got to do with it? A successful doctor closes his office, goes away on a vacation. His nurse, too? Now, come, Doctor. Of course, he needed a rest. - And you? - I went to visit my family. - Spring Lake? - Malcolm Falls. - Same route, isn't it? - Why, yes. Yeah. You don't mind ifl use your private phone, Doctor? Long distance. Supervisor, please. This is Inspector Gregg, headquarters. Have there been any long-distance calls to this number in the last four or five hours? Oh, wait a minute. This is Main 9210. All right, I'll wait. Roufine. I hope you don't mind. Yes? Yes, there was a long-distance call. GREGG: Where from? From Spring Lake early this morning. Was it a man or a woman? I couldn't tell. The voices were muffled. I couldn't distinguish whether it was a man or a woman. All right. Thank you, Operator. - What is this all about? - The fire. Well, you can't suspect us. We weren't here. Why don't you explain it to her, Doctor? It seems that the fire started in the telephone box. There were signs of acid. An old trick. Should interest the fire department. Not hard to track down, enhen Did the train stop at Spring Lake? Well, yes. I don't suppose you got off, did you? On the contrary, I did. I went to the newsstand and bought a magazine. Well, I'm sorry. My apologies. Got a match, Doctor? Of course. Thank you. Mind ifl keep these, Doctor? Mark, he frightens me. Darling, why would anyone want to set fire to the office? I wish I knew. We'd better look through the files. I hope the books aren't burnt. Your personal files, they're ruined. Cancelled cheques. Home expenses. The record of all of Maria '5 bills and my personal accounts, destroyed. Well, don't worry about it, dean It'll make it just that much easier for you. Now you won't have to break-in the new girl. She can inaugurate her own system. What's wrong with me? It's three days since the fire. I can't keep my mind on my work. The least sound seems to upset me. I wonder why? [DOOR SLAMS] What's going on out here? Mrs. Duval was here. I told her you couldn't be bothered. Weren't you being inconsiderate? You know what she's going through. But you can't do anything for her now. Besides, it brings back unpleasant memories. Oh, I guess you're right. What's the date today? It's the 28th. That's why Mrs. Duval wanted to see me. Her husband dies tomorrow morning at 5:00. How could I have been so cruel? Shall I call her back? No, it would only add to her injury. I think I'll leave early tonight. Mark, I know how you feel. You mustn't let it bother you. It's a man's life. I once took an oath that I'd save lives. If there was only something I could do in this case. Stella, I don't want to be alone tonight. Would you have dinner with me? Maybe a show? Just anything to pass the time. Of course, darling. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING ON SCREEN] [PEOPLE LAUGHING] Thinking of Duval? Are you? Yes. Stella, I don't want to go home. Let's go back to the office and sit there until this horrible thing is over. Waite r. Stella looks very tired. The strain seems to be too much for her. Drink? There you are. Stella, I don't know what I would have done without you. You've been so considerate. Well, here's to... - I don't want it. - Neither do I. I know. I know just how you feel. What time is it? A few minutes to 5:00. The evening's been so long. Long for us, yes, but think of Duval. He only has two minutes to live. Now, only a minute and a half. He's gone. No more Duval. You're tired, aren't you, Stella? Asleep. Rest. Rest. That's it, Stella. Sleep. Sleep. DUVAL: Stella! Stella! [ECHOING] Stella! Stella! Stella! I'm returning the money that Maria gave me. Don't be a fool. The Doctor doesn't know a thing about it. I fixed the records. We're in the clear. Give me back your share. I'm returning that, too. I won't. You've got yours, I've got mine, and I'm going to keep it. Oh, no, you're not. Maria means too much to me. Even ifl have to tell the Doctor. Tell the Doctor? You wouldn't dare. I love her. I'd do anything, even tell the Doctor. Oh, no, you're not going to tell him. He belongs to me. I planned all this. Don't interfere. I'll see you dead first. [RUMBLING] What are you doing here? You followed me. Get out. Get out! I hate you! Get out! Get out! Get out! [MARIA SCREAMING] Listen, Mark. Listen. You drove to the lodge. Maria was there. She was drunk. She accused you of following her. You argued. You pushed her away and ran out of the house. As you got in the car, through the rearview mirror, you saw Duval enter the house. Do you hear? You saw Duval enter the house. Now, repeat what I said. Do you hear? Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Now, please. Get a girl to take care of the office. As a nurse, I'm afraid I can't replace you. I mustn't let you go through the files. I mustn't let you see the cancelled cheques for the money Maria gave Duval. Mustn't let you find out. Mustn't let you see the cancelled cheques. Thank you, Doctor. I'll have a girl here Monday morning. Long distance, please. [MUTTERING PRAYER] Don't let them do it, Mark! Don't let them. Mark! Mark! [SCREAMING] GREGG: You can set your watch back now, Doctor. It's exactly 10 after 4:00. What happened, Mark? Mark. Miss Madden, I hold you for the murder of Maria Steele. It's a lie. Tell him! You can't arrest me. - You have no evidence, no witnesses. - Only your conscience. You tricked me. You knew it all the time. But nobody will believe you. Oh, no! My word is as good as yours. Do you hear? Nobody will believe you. You have no proof. We have all the proof we need. STELLA: You have no proof. Let me go! You have no proof, I tell you! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! You have no proof! Operator, this is Inspector Gregg, headquarters. - Why did you suspect me? - I didn't. I only used you for bait, because I knew you'd lead me to the criminal. She was clever, almost too clever. Hello, Williams, Gregg. Duval's clear. Yeah. No, the Doctor's nurse. Yeah. No, that won't be necessary. I'll make the report out myself. Right. Well, Doc, it's been pretty tough on you, hasn't it? But do you know something? I envy you. How's that? Well, you've got something to go back to, but with me it's different. You see, some place at this very moment, a crime is being contemplated. All I can do is sit and wait. I start with death, I look for life, and when I find it, I've got to destroy it. [RINGING] Hello? Yes. Oh, yes, he's here. Just a moment. - It's for you. - Thanks. Hello? Yeah. Stewart Hotel? Murder? All right, I'll be right over. See what I mean? Well, so long, Doctor.
