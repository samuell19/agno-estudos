THE CHRISTENING See? Grandma knows what's good. WHERE THERE IS LOVE AND AMITY HAPPINESS WILL SETTLE FOR ETERNITY STARRING I'm home. Jesus, it's you. Who else? Aren't you dressed yet? On a day like this? I've got a full house. Wojtek came at 3 a.m. It's freezing cold, yet he came. See? What are you doing? You're gonna break it. What's the matter? War. What war? The statement of the Military Council of National Salvation: Forces hostile to our socialist state, using the people's... by forces hostile to Socialism... Have the Russians entered? Jaruzelski imposed martial law. People will get arrested. Maybe it won't be that bad. We mustn't give up. Jaruzelski's a Pole, after all. What matters is that the war hasn't been started by the Russians. The phones must be dead. Hands. We survived Hitler and Stalin. We'll handle Jaruzelski too. I must be going. - Where? - To the seminary. Be back before one, father? What's at one? - A christening, of course. - What christening? Of Hanka's child. - We'll see how things turn out. - But... everyone's already here. Wojtek has come. He'll be first to leave, when he finds out what happened. Of all the people. Perhaps, he's already gone. Marianna... it is war. But the christening... - Father. - I'll see what can be done. Perhaps, you'll need to look for another godfather. - How about Tolo? - Tolo? Yes. Make sure he goes to confession first. The Council of National Salvation has no other goals than those they announced on the day of its institution. Its only objective is the well-being of the nation. Everything's been arranged. There was supposed to be a christening, the reconciliation of my children. You know how much I want it. Why are you doing this to me? Come in. Or you'll catch a cold. Tolo came back two hours ago. - He fell down twice and went to bed. - Tolo... The christening's coming. Everything's on my head. Tereska, I heard on the radio at the priest's house... Tereska... You think any of them got up to help me out, mom? There comes the princess. Good morning. You're up? - Oh, the baby's sleeping here? - Don't wake him up! Don't! - Do you have any real coffee here? - It's no hotel. They served three types of coffee over at Lake Balaton. - Is it his car? - Wojtek had to show off his success. - Should he live in squalor like you? - Got any problem? - You may leave. - Sure. If we bring goodies, we're welcome. But now we can leave. Where's the coffee? - I haven't invited you here. - You have no say in this. Can you hear her, mom? I've come to see Hanka. - Since when do you care about her? - Someone has to protect her from you. See how noble she's become? I know what she heard from you. You run to the church every day, but the childbirth was a tragedy. - Stop that! - Children... I'm sorry, mom, but it's all Tereska's fault. Something horrible has happened. Some tragedy, again. I can't listen to it. Don't worry, mom. I'm raising 2 kids single-handed, so Hanka can manage one. The statement of the Military Council of National Salvation: Forces hostile to our socialist... Leave it on. Maybe they'll play some music. If I leave it on, there'll be nothing. I forgot only church songs are allowed in this house. Get dressed at last. You look like... The christening is today. - What's wrong with her? - Leave her alone. The baby's making her nervous. When Hanka's belly started growing, she lay prostrate for 3 days. How's Hanka? She's radiant. Smiles all the time. - Leave it. - What's wrong with it? Old stuff. Give it back. - But it can be fixed. Why put it away? - Give it back. - Leave it, mom. - Give it to me! You'll wake Wojtek up. - What time did he arrive? - At 3 a.m. Are you happy, mom? - About what? - About the godfather. You could be one. If Hanka had told me who the father was, I would've agreed. So you didn't want to be one, but Wojtek did. - Exactly. - What, exactly? - He did it out of spite. - Nonsense. He's been avoiding me for years. Haven't you avoided him too? He's your brother. We're having a family ceremony today. Don't spoil it, please. Calm down, children. - Why did you put him in the kitchen? - I wanted you to sleep well. - But I want him to sleep with me. - Don't get him used to it. God... - Hanka! - Hello, Hania. He'll be covered in flour. Toluś... Get up, Toluś. I told you not to hang with those drunks. Didn't I? What have those punks turned you into? Don't touch me, mom. Don't. Who's the pretty boy here? Who's so... He smiled at me. Did you see it? Who's smiling at auntie... - When are you gonna have a child? - Excuse me? You already have a candidate, right? Do you have a problem with Kazik? Better take care of your wife. Hold it for me, Irenka. - What shall I do with it? - Rinse it. - Time to make breakfast. - I'm busy. And get dressed at last. - We need firewood, Tadzio. - Can't Wojtek do that? He's asleep. So is Tolo. Go, Tadzio. - I'm going. - I said from the left, Tereska. Did they see each other? - Wojtek and Tadeusz. - No. So that they'd kill each other? - Don't worry. I spoke with Tadzio. - It's not Tadzio I worry about. The king's parked it in the middle. Good morning. God bless. - Finally. - Irenka. I haven't seen you for 3 years. You've turned into a real lady. With such a car you could visit us more often. - They gave me a coupon, so I took it. - Nobody wants to give anything to me. Oh, Teresa... Good things are lying on the street. You just need to pick them up. - Right, mom? - You need to pray, Wojtuś. There's always time to pray. Whom am I seeing? From your uncle. - I love it. - You've grown. Breakfast will be ready soon. Beata. - Piotrek, give me the chocolate. - Teresa, please... - What are you wearing, Iruś? - A dress. God have mercy. - It's best at mama's, right? - Thanks for agreeing. You can always count on me. It's ages. Twelve? Fifteen years? Welcome home, Wojtek. Come here. Where's your better half? She's ill. And yours? The hard frost stopped her. Dear children, we're finally together. - After all these years. - Mom... Thank you, Mother. Thank you. Piotrek broke the TV. How come? Stay with Wojtuś, Tadzio. I'll take a look. How long does it take to sober up? How long can one be reaching out... What about the morning cartoon? There'll be no cartoons. Why? Because there's a christening today. Let's go, Beata. Chop-chop. - But I want to watch it... - The TV's broken. Your yeast must be better, Teresa. So? How old are you? 'Cause I can't tell. - 8 and a half. - Is that so? How much is that? A lot, or not? There'll be no war in my house, general. Nice? Do you like it? I chose the color myself. Is it good? Get in, don't be shy. 1.5 liter engine. I did 130 without a problem on my way here. Look, it opens here. Would you buy one for yourself? I'll help you get one. No. A bus stop is nearby. Calm down. Breakfast is almost ready. Put on your slippers, Tolo, or you'll catch a cold. Mom! - Where are my shoes? - Put on your slippers. If I can't find my shoes, I'll walk barefoot to the church. - You're talking nonsense, again. - Mom! Give me my shoes back. Piotruś, have you seen my shoes? Beatka? - If you don't give me my shoes back... - Grandma threw them in the stove. Are you crazy, mom? - What's this smell? - Is something burning? - Tolek's on fire. - Are you crazy? - Mom! - Toluś! Throw this damn thing away. It's not a damn thing. These are American shoes. - You're not going to wear these. - I'm not. I'm gonna fly in these. Toluś... For God's sake. Are you nuts? Wojtuś, there you are! - Where did you get these shoes? - I won them in a card game. - You sweet madman... - Those who wear them will go far. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Bless us, our Lord, and this meal, and those who have prepared it. Teach us to share our bread and happiness with those who don't have it. In the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen. Amen. Let's sit. Enjoy your meal. Hania, I have a gift for you and the baby. - Give it after the christening. - It doesn't matter when, but what. Tadek is right. Sit down, Wojtek. - Wojtek... - What? - The presents can be given now, Tadzio. - Mom... - For you. You'll find it useful. - Thank you. Beata. Get the... you know what. Hania... So beautiful! What does it say? Something in Hungarian. Kazik and I bought it at Lake Balaton. - This is from us. - Thank you. - Everything's in Polish. - Thank you very much, Teresa. Eat, kids. - Wojtuś... - Hania... You'll have to wait a bit for my present. - As usual. - But it'll be the best. - Eat, Tolo. Stop talking. - Don't you believe me? - Toluś... - Relax. - No, no. Don't you believe me? You'll hand it later. What's the problem? When I say I've got a present for Karol, everybody starts... - Mom! - Enough! Cross yourselves and eat. Give me your plate. - I'm sitting next to Tolo. - The plate. This rosary is straight from the Vatican. - Is it? - Yep, from the Pontiff. A nun from our parish gave it to me. She came back from Rome a month ago. Will you pass me the white sausage? - What are you gonna name him? - You don't know? - Karol. - Karol sounds nice. Very nice. Like our Pope. - At least, he'll have a decent name. - Eat, Tadzio. I forgot about the blood sausage. - I'll get it. - No, stay. Get me more of this sausage. It's delicious. I will. Shall we have porkchops for dinner? Pierogi. - You'll serve pierogi to the priest? - He likes them. - Don't tell me what to cook. - Are we having a priest for dinner? Yes. He must be hosted properly. I don't understand why. Because he agreed to baptize this... Bastard? Is that what you were gonna say? - Isn't he one? - How can you? A kid should know his father. - You'd surely refuse to baptize him. - Stop it. Wojtek... A sausage for you. - And the blood sausage. Eat. - You're a true Catholic. My children were baptized in a normal way. I wasn't forced to do that. The christening at 5 a.m. was your idea too? That's what I wanted. No one forced me. No one forced you to join the commies, either. - Now you'll be a godfather. - Tadeusz... - Shall I pretend he's not a commie? - I'll wait in the church. Stay, Wojtek. Don't go. - I'm coming with Wojtek. - No, you're not. Sit down. Go, get him, Toluś. Didn't I ask you? Didn't I? He provoked me, mom. That's the way it was. I knew our family reconciliation would end this way. Stop it, Irka. Go, change. Mom! Mom! The coat! Wojtek! Wait, we need to talk. We must all be together here. Get my bag. You'll give it to me in the church. Wait! Without you, my present... Wojtek! Don't be mad. Tadzio didn't mean to offend you. - He was always most important to you. - Don't say that. Damn it! - Wojtek... - Hold it. Listen to me. I have... My christening present is for eternity, understand? It's no ordinary gift... Stop talking nonsense. Grab the hood at the front. It's frozen solid. I'll get Tadzio. Stop talking about him! You're both talking shit! Tadzio this, Tadzio that! - I won a whole container at cards. - Cards? I'm doing pretty well. What else did you win? A present for Hanka. You'll see. Everyone will be stunned. Especially, Tadek. Do something with your life, Tolo. Join the riot police, or something. - Riot police? - You'll have board and lodging. Good money. You'll straighten out your life. How long can you play card? Who's hung up Uncle Stefan's portrait in the dining room? - Tadek. - Tadek... Yesterday. To make me mad. Same egos - mom's brother and Tadzio. Wojtek... I've heard you wanted to beat up late uncle during Father's funeral. - Yeah? - Yes. Tadek defended him, so you fought over the coffin. - Who says that? - Everyone. If everyone says that, then it must be true, right? I'll help you, mom. You already have. We're going to the church now. - We still have time. - We'll go early. We'll pray. Where are you going? - To our neighbor. To make a call. - To whom? Kazik. I told you I don't want that divorcee in my house. Relax, mom. He won't enter the house. He'll just get me my dress. - You're going nowhere. - I was supposed to change. - You'll wear Tereska's dress. - I'll look weird. - It's not your wedding. - You always have problems. Not when Kazik brings clothes for your kids, though. For heaven's sake, Irka! You'd rot in squalor, if it wasn't for Kazik. - Breakfast, Wojtuś. - When I'm back. And where are you going? - To our neighbor. To make a call. - I'll come with you. - You're going nowhere. - I must check what's up at the mine. If things get ugly in the country, I'll have to go back. But... the phones are dead. Something happened? - The neighbor's phone's broken. - It worked fine yesterday. - There was a short circuit. - Was there? Electricity fried the phone. It burnt. Thank God no one was injured. Tereska... Wojtuś and Tadzio will move the bed out of the old bedroom. - But it's time for the christening. - We still have time. - Remove the mattress. - What about your wedding photo? - Tadzio will hang it up in my room. - And where will I sleep, then? If you will stay until tomorrow, you can take the kitchen. Don't tell me where to sleep and when to go. It is also my house. Be quiet, Wojtuś, or you'll wake the baby. That old bed takes so much space, and Tereska could have a room for her kids. Take off your coat. Warm up the sausages. Wojtuś will eat breakfast. Don't stand like this. Take the bed out. Forgive me my little lies, Holy Mother. It's for their good. You're afraid of 'Solidarity', aren't you? - I'm not into politics. I'm a union man. - A commie one. More to the right. The other right. - Will you make it? - I will. They'll enter here and set everything right. You mean the Russians? - Yes, if you keep messing things up. - It's you who are messing things up. - Pick it up. - Don't stand like that. Lift it. Great, Wojtek. Now scratch my guardrail. Get out of here, Teresa. Tolo! Tolo! Now you can chop it for firewood. You should've held it better. You screw up whatever you touch. Should've left the bed where it was. Do you have any shirts? His wardrobe is full of them. Pick one. Let it go, Teresa. - Can I help you with anything? - You've helped enough. I only got him a passport. - Only... - He asked me himself. Because you bragged you could do it. Because I could. I'm left here with two kids, and he's hanging with some slut in America. Maybe he'll come back. To what? This filth? This poverty? Do you know what I dream about? About all this falling apart and guys like you taking a hit too. - Teresa... - No. You know what? Do you want it? There you go! - There! - Teresa! That's all I have left of him. - Teresa... - Get out! Out! Mom got mad. You'll all thank me one day. When will you tell us who his daddy is? Beata, come, we're leaving. - When will auntie tell us? - Tereska, dress the kids. Piotruś, let's go. Irka, this dress is gorgeous. Perfect for a christening. Toluś, put your shoes on. Grandma, maybe the baby has no daddy at all? Like us. Tadzio... Us what? We have no daddy, either. - But we did and we knew him. - He fell off a roof and killed himself. - Or maybe he jumped, mom? - Enough, Tolo! - You have only one thing in mind. - You spoke to Wojtek? It's time. Let's go. Daddy would still be alive, if not for Uncle Stefan. - Toluś... - Stop talking nonsense. - He killed our dad. - Shut up. He killed our dad, and you hang... Tadzio... When I look at you... Are you gonna hang yourself? - How can you? - I'm fed up with his cowing. - You have no right to say that! - Does he have a right to cow us? Toluś! Tolo! Tolo! Come back! Come back! Toluś! I'm begging you, don't let anything happen to him, don't let him hurt himself, let him come back safe and sound. Please. What are you doing here? We'll be in the church soon. - Any strangers in the house? - No. - And whose car is that? - Wojtek's. - Hasn't he left yet? - No. - I didn't expect that of him. - It's the christening. - We have to put it off till seven. - Why? I'm on my way to the curia, but I'll be back by seven. The militia are looking for my nephew. Will you put him up for a few days? Janek? Sure. Good. God bless you. - God bless you. - Come here in the evening. - Okay. - In the evening? The militia came for him to the seminary. - I can't put him up now. - Why? I don't even have a free bed. - It's not the bedtime. - Let's go to town. - What? - Janek is right. Right about what? The militia are on every corner. You want to have him sent off to Siberia in cuffs? Do you? Go. Don't tell my kids about the martial law. - Don't they know? - Not yet. - Didn't you tell them? - You said they'd leave, if they knew. But it's a war. The christening and the reconciliation of my children are most important to God. Your words, father. What christening? You should know that as a future priest. Your children must know the truth. Wiesław... It's the first time in 15 years I've had them all together here. I promise I'll tell them right after the christening. I'll tell them myself. If you tell my children about the martial law, then, forgive me, Lord, I'll turn him in! You're out of your mind. - No. - Come here! - Put this hat on. - No. Come here! - God bless you. - Bless you. - The parson's here. - God bless you. The christening will be at seven p.m. Father must go to the curia, and Janek will wait here. - Listen... - See you in the evening. - Something happened? - No. Father's a bit off. - Something serious? - Just a mild cold. Make him some tea. He'll warm up a bit. But he's in a hurry. Mom, one minute won't make a difference, and it'll be an honor for us. Really. I have your favorite pierogis. - The bishop's waiting. - Tea will do me good. Where shall I go, children? There? To the dining room? Painted from the photo I got from you, father. Looks similar. Like a living image, indeed. Irka. The tea's too hot. Pour some cold one in. Father's in a hurry. Mom... Why doesn't father have some pierogis? Father's not hungry. I haven't eaten since morning, so I'd love to. Janek, come to the table. Take a seat. - Praise the Lord. - Naturally. Praise the Lord. We apologize for the situation with Hanka. She won't tell us who the father is. Exactly. Has anyone spoken to the photographer yet? - The photographer? - About the wedding. - A wedding? - Better late than never. - What's the hurry? - Tadek! If not him, then who? Tea's cold. - I'll make you a new one. - Thank you. Our new Christian. Cute. How's the seminary? Excuse me? How's the seminary? It's been just a few months. - Pierogis? - No, thank you. - I'll have some. - No, thank you. Are you still with 'Solidarity'? I spend more time with God. Very well. We often reminisce about you punching that commie militiaman back in Cracow. - Tadeusz... - I'm telling the truth, mom. Right? Good they didn't catch you then. Yes. This morning, the militia came looking for me in the seminary. You chase people even in the seminaries. - Tadek. - Come help me, Janek. I've got a book. - Get me some of those Russian pierogis. - I'll have some too. - Do you think they'll move in, father? - Excuse me? The Russians? They're already here, Tadek. I asked you not to mention the martial law. Whole Poland... Whole Poland knows about it. Even the whole world knows it by now. - Why are we hiding it? - For their good. But... So I must lie for their good? Just don't say anything. Of course. Listen... - We must tell them. - Of course, we must. My late brother would never understand it. Leave late father Stefan out of it. Leave him out? Have you forgotten who made you a priest? The parishioners should know their parson has denied the priesthood twice? - How many? - I can't believe that. Father! I managed to get... Not a word about the martial law, or else... One for the road won't do any harm. I've got everything. A parish stamp, a priest's signature. - I can be a godfather. - Where did you get it? From a priest at a parish. But you don't go to church. The priest knows me, and... I mean I know the priest, and got it done. I don't sign stuff for commies that lightly. Wojtuś... Tell me honestly. In your heart, haven't you turned away from God? Come on, father. I envy you. What do you envy me? You don't have to lie and pretend. You live in the truth. Is it done, then? To hell with our father, who abandoned our mom and is knocking about in America. Amen. - Amen. - Amen. What are you doing? DECEMBER 13 SUNDAY The whole family hates me. You hate, too. Whom? Your mom's brother, father Stefan, though he's been dead for years. He slapped me in front of everyone at the cemetery. You yelled your dad committed suicide because of him. Because it's true. Wojtek... Things aren't always the way we think they are. - I joined the Party because of him. - You did. - To spite everyone. - Now what? There'll be a war, the Russians will come. Am I supposed to shoot my brother? Why aren't you saying something, Father? Why? What are you doing here? Your mom told me to stay here. What happened? - I shouldn't be telling you. - Telling us what? Because you still don't know... - We do know. - You do? Father told me at the table. - I'm so glad to hear that. - I'm not. I'm frustrated. Everyone in the seminary is broken. - Do they know about it? - They know everywhere. It's good Uncle Stefan hasn't lived long enough to see it. I hate that four-eyes. - I'd... with my bare hands. - He's just a stooge. - A stooge? - A soviet agent. - A mole. - I bet my head on it. What's going on? Did you hear, mom? I don't know whether it can get any worse with Hania. First, Father tells me the photographer knocked her up. Now, it turns out he's a soviet spy. I hate those guys. I just do. I hate them so much. The photographer's a soviet spy? - Not the photographer. - Who, then? General Jaruzelski. Jaruzelski? Come. I hate them commies. I'll tell him. I will. I didn't know you smoked. Let me light it up for you. Is it working? I dented your fender a bit this morning. Good you didn't puncture the tire. I'd have to stay with you till Christmas. How are things at home? Good. Zosia wants a divorce. I messed up, too. But I hope it can be fixed. I don't. What's he doing here? Tolo? What? - There's a war. - We'll have one soon, for sure. - What's he doing here? - If there's a christening, there's a need for what? Pictures. Eternal souvenirs. - Who's that? - The damn photographer. I won him at cards. If Tolo says there'll be a surprise, there will be one. - Why have you brought that scum here? - What's the matter? - He knocked Hanka up. - How would you know? Were you in bed with them? Come here, lensman. I won't let you inside the house. Not that punk. Stop being a bully. It's not your house. It's our house. - Better deal with your wife... - Hey... Don't run your mouth at your elder brother. Father! Not now, Tolo. - Father... - Toluś... You gotta stay, father. We'll be taking christening photos now. We have that... professional here. - He's quick at it. - So I've heard. Okay. Come in. - But, father... - Come in. Lensman! Come in, lensman! Mom... - If Tolo says there'll be a surprise... - Better be quiet, Toluś. Wojtek, Tadek! Come inside! Watch out. Tereska... If Tolo says you'll get a present, you'll get a present. Hurry up. - You have some pretty daughters. - Focus on your work. - Like mother, like daughters. - Come, mom. Whom are you hanging with? - What do you mean? - He's a soviet spy. - How do you know? - I know from someone who knows. Why have you come here? - Because they say he looks like me. - You've got some nerve. I don't want to see you here. May I have a word with you? Did you knock her up? Don't you fucking understand Polish? - It wasn't me, I swear. - You swear? Seriously? - If you speak to Hanka again... - I said it wasn't me. Shut up! Do your job and get the fuck out. You'll get married after the christening. - To whom? - It'll be for the best. I'll always have a job for you: weddings, funerals, christenings. But Hanka doesn't want me. But you're her child's father. Well, yes. We'll convince her. Father... Her brothers... this and that one... don't like me. Because you're an oaf. For eternity. Amen. - God bless you. - Hold on. One more. - Calm down! - Be quiet. At least there'll be photos left, when they kill us all. - Why would they kill us? - Because there's a war. - What are you talking about? - He's such a joker! For eternity. - Haven't you listened to the radio? - Come with me, Toluś. Come. Why, mom? Go. - I heard at the photo lab that Jaruzelski declared martial law. - Stop blabbering about a war. - Mom! Tanks... Mommy! I've heard at the photo... - Toluś... - Mom! I've heard it on the radio. Didn't you? Go, now. You've changed. You haven't. Still in shape. I didn't recognize you in those glasses. Come to my place tonight. Too late. I'll be waiting. - I'm in love with someone else. - You're making me jealous. Stop. Stay here. War. I'll be expecting you at the vicarage next week. For you, father. - You shouldn't have. - I should have. - Thank you. - It's fresh, homemade. I'll see you to your car. There. God bless you. That sausage was for Kazik. Relax. Kazik will be fine. So will you, right? It's easy to give away what's not yours. Why are you staring like that? I told you to stay away. - Talk to Hanka about the wedding. - What wedding? With the photographer. He's all for it. I don't need him here. It's for her own good. - Where's Janek? - Busy. What did they say? - I haven't gotten there yet. - You haven't? Janek... Should you speak to Hanka, get her round to the lensman. He's not that bad. Tell her not to act up. She must get her life straight. Don't go anywhere. - Don't exaggerate. - It's for his good. - See you in the evening. - Like I said. God bless you. Why have you brought that scum here? - It's my present. - Get a grip, kid! Take him out of here! Do it, now! Lensman! Lensman! What the hell? - Hello, Kazik. - Hi, Tolo. - Irka's wants to see you. Let's go home. - Maybe... you could bring her out here. It's freezing. Tolo... Come back inside. Now! Mom! Change those shoes! Mom! The christening will be in the evening. Be back for Irka in the morning. Bye. Wait. I'm not going anywhere without her. There are militia everywhere. - I have my trunk packed with stuff. - We're decent folks. No, no, no... I'm begging you. You must help me, please. Help me, God. Is it far? No. - You can stash everything there. - You've helped me a lot. - I've got loads of merchandise. - You're so resourceful. Like a typical Pole. Champagne, gum, coffee. Fine stockings - they sell like hot cakes. They're in great demand. I'm doing it for Irenka. I'll keep her safe, I promise. During the war and today, too. I'll keep her safe today. Come back tomorrow. No way, I won't leave her. I have some serious plans for her. That's why... I wanna show you something. Take a look. Austrian. I bought it at Lake Balaton. Irenka doesn't know yet. Have a look, mom. Excuse me for a second. - Nice view. - Yep... Where are you from? Chrzanów, near Cracow. Cracow... Beautiful. Damn it! Stop! Where...? Stop! Stop! Stop! There is a war. Toluś, please. We've talked about it. You may go if you want. - Go to bed. - There's a war, people! Calm down. Just get some fresh air. You heard that? They've come for you. You think I'm scared? I'll be first to kick their asses, and you'll keep laughing here. If Tolo says there'll be a war, there will be a war. War... Who's there? Open up. - What have you been doing in there? - I heard what you yelled. - Don't you believe me? - I do. I'll show you, if you don't. If Tolo says there's a war... Relax. - Things will clear up soon, anyway. - Tolo, stop! You'll see, Tereska. Tolo! Knock it off. Can't you see it's off? Look. There's no plug. Piotruś... - Who broke the TV? - Why Piotruś? Why him? Maybe it was Tolo? Come, Piotruś. Beatka said it was Piotruś who broke the TV. Piotrek... Did you break the TV? Tell me the truth. Why are you picking on him? - Who else would've done it? - Tadeusz... Calm down. Did you see who did it? Tell us. Grandma. Piotrek! Where did you put the plug? Come here! Jesus! Oh, God! Tolo! - What happened? - Is he alive? - No pulse. - He's dead! - Go get an ambulance, Irka! - Get me some light. - Toluś. - Resuscitate him. Janek! Help him. - Still no pulse. - Anybody seen my car keys? - Teresa! Come here! - Toluś! Mom! Jesus! Come here, give me a hug. - Damn it! - He was trying to save him. Tolo... I was. Tolo... Toluś! Where are my shoes, mom? I've got them, Toluś. Who got the idea to put the fuses up in the loft? It must've been Uncle Stefan. He was always full of ideas. The moment he moved into our house, he started to boss the show. Knock it off. Have you forgotten how it was when our father got drunk? And how he treated our family, our mom? The brawls. You forgot that? - If it hadn't been for Uncle Stefan... - we'd have a home, not a church. Guys like you that got our father dead. Commies like you. Really? You took his store. Our store. You wasted his life. Was it me who pushed him off the roof, too? It was an accident. He was fixing the roof with uncle, and he just fell. - Nonsense! - He did. I was here. I saw and heard everything. If it hadn't been for Stefan, dad would still be alive. Shut the hell up, okay? - Stop it, boys. - Mom... - Stop it. - Mom, mom, mom... Mom, mom, mom... Tell him, then. - Tell him our father committed suicide. - Knock it off! Boys, I wanted to protect you from your father. I believed Stefan could help us. Your father threatened to kill himself. He did it up here in the loft, too. Stefan got angry and yelled, "Jump, if you want to." That's what you heard, son. What you don't know is your father looked at me, then. He wanted me to stop him, but I said, "I'm fed up with you." That's what I said. It's me who killed him. It's pounding. Like a sledgehammer. - You don't mean it. - I do. But it was quiet before. I don't know. Maybe you've become deaf in the seminary. True. I was deaf and blind. But after what happened here... - Get dressed. We're going out. - Where to? To the church. There's a christening, Tolo. Put on something warm, so that you don't catch a cold. The parson said he's a good man. Tolo? He's a saint. I mean the photographer. - What? - The parson thinks you should marry him. Get your life straight for yourself and the kid. Hania, the child needs a father. - Hanuś... There you are. - I'll be right back with you. Hania... There should be no secrets in our family. The photographer is the child's father, isn't he? Even the parson says that. You've always been... - such a good child. - You never allowed me to do anything. - You never caused me any trouble. - You didn't let me date anyone. - I never saw you with a boy. - Because in high school, I burnt all the letters right after reading them. - What letters? - From him, so you wouldn't know. So the letter boy is the father? The one from high school? Tell me. Who is it? Speak. The photographer is not my baby's father. Who is it then? - Who's the father? - Leave me alone, please. - Who is it? - Get out. Why did you tell me the photographer was the father? - I didn't want to keep you away from God. - What are you talking about? Why didn't you tell me about the seminary? - Wait... - Did you lie to me? - Do you know how I found out? - No. From the parson. He passed the good news to all the parishioners during the service. - You didn't answer my letters. - Because all you wrote about was that damned 'Solidarity'. And your love for it. Because I could never feel much love from you. I didn't even know you were pregnant. - Because you weren't here. - Why would I want to be here? I hated you so much. No more than I hated you. Wojtuś, you can't smoke in here. Tadzio, we'll go to church early. We'll pray. Tereska, dress the children. Hanuś, we're leaving. You're staying, Janek. - I need to say something. - Not now. - Excuse me! - I want to announce something. - What is it? When we get back from the church. Beatka, come to granny. - Mom, what's going on? - Secrets, again? I'm the father of this baby. What? What did you say? I've decided to quit the seminary. Hania and I will get married. Grandma, the baby has a daddy. - Grandma... - You knew about it, mom. Say whatever you will, I'm going in my dress. Why didn't you tell us, mom? If Tolo says we're going together, we're going together. Toluś... What? You got no absolution, did you? Come, Kazik. Don't be shy. Kazik? Weirdo, devotee, rogue, mommy... Warm up some tea, mom. My brother-in-law's freezing. - What brother-in-law? - Sorry, mom. - Leave, please. - Leave him alone. - Leave my house. - Mom... Kazik! Wait! Let go of me! War. We'll drink to Karolek. Toluś... Mom... Wojtek, come here! You're a commie, but you're our commie. There'll be no drinking. What? Now you can't even drink in this house? Give me my champagne back. - Tolo! Stop. - I need a drink. - Give me that! There's a war! - Tolo! Damn you all! Toluś... It's damn cold. I'd rather freeze to death than get back to those freaks. Tolo! Tolo! Tolo! - You were to become a priest. - Leave us. How could you do that to us? Tolo! Please... I'm glad you're here, Kazik. - If it wasn't for that brat... - Stay out of it. - Stay out? Hanka's my sister. - Mine, too. It's none of your shitty business who the father is. You can talk like that at those Party meetings of yours, not in our family house. - You ruined this country. - Who's "you"? - Who's "you"? You are a commie! - And who are you? You won't last long, you'll see. This time you won't stop me. - What war? - Tanks, soldiers, Jaruzelski... In the fall instead of leaves, commies will hang up in the trees! Go ahead, kill me! - Here, hold it. - Stab a commie! Stab me, here! I'll teach you about anti-state demonstrations. - Leave him alone! - Let go of me! - What's going on? - We're having a christening. - What fucking christening? - Mom! - Come, Beata, Piotrek. - There's martial law. - Relax, Tadzio. The man's watching. - What martial law? - I've been trying to tell you all day. - What the fuck's going on? They don't know anything. Mom knew there's been martial law in the country since morning. - I'd tell you after the christening. - You lied to us. How could you? - I'm done. I'm moving out. - Me too. To America. - You're my children. - I wouldn't do it to my children. - I have no kids... - But you could. Because I didn't want to be a mother like you. I've always wanted the best for you. Papers. Now! We're having a christening. Let us go. - I know you. - I know you too. So what? - So what? - So what? It's the priest's nephew. We went for him today. - Yeah? Get him. - Calm down. Stop! Take me instead. Stop it! Stop it! Right on time, father. - What's going on here? - A Pole to a Pole... Children, let's go. We're going to the church. You're going fucking nowhere. Are you gonna kill me? Are you gonna shoot me and my children? Come, children, we're leaving. Wojtuś, Toluś. What are you doing? Get them! You'll take Hania and Teresa with the kids in your car, father. To the church! Kazik! Janek! To the church! - Cuff them! - And you? You're a good man. I can see that. Will you give us a ride to the church? POSTSCRIPT This is the faith of our church that we profess with pride, in the name of Jesus, our Lord... Amen. Do you want Karol to be baptized in the faith that we have just professed? We do. Remove the baby's cap. Bring him closer. Karol, I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Glory be to the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning, is now and shall ever be. Amen. Archangel Gabriel, Dispatched to Mary In the Majesty of the Holy Trinity, Has thus passed the message to Her "Hail Mary, Full of Grace, The Lord is with Thee, it is certain" The Lady was astounded greatly By the message she had heard. She bowed humbly, As She was a restrained maiden, Saddened by the news, She gave the Angel no reply.
