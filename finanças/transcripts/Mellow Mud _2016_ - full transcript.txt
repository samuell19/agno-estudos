Stop it You'll get it! Maybe mom doesn't have any money and that's why she is not coming back? Raya? How should I know. MELLOW MUD My Mon got it from some chick. She said she'd been renting a room with your mom. What chick is that? Rented where? Didn't she give you the address? Can I use your phone? - No credit left. You can get lost if you so wish, but you will not sell our house. Your house? It was all bought with the money I got for selling my apartment. Bullshit! Dad earned that money in Riga! Dad would have earned it in Riga if he hadn't hooked up with your mother! I am calling Daina. We are rejecting you. Go ahead! Go ahead! And then what? You will not sell our house! A real nut case. I'll have to make a call to take her to the loony bin Can you move any faster? And what are you doing now?? You are clearly demonstrating that it's impossible to deal with you. Either Olga remains your guardian and you go back to the house or... Yes I know Or you will put us in an orphanage. I didn't create these laws. Believe me! And try to behave sensibly. "English Language Competition" You don't cone to classes, you miss tests and then you want to go to the competition. I'll take all my make-ups. I'll take all the make-ups. And I won't cut any classes. Super. But the answer had to be given already last week. Don't make trouble... Put down the rock, you hear? You can't act like this. Next time I won't get you out of here as easily. You were lucky... He won't bring charges against you. And don't blame grandma... The debts had to be paid up.. Be thankful they did not take away everything. Raya… If I can help you somehow, with anything, you just tell me... Help me with what? Help me to sell everything? Who asked you to butt into our lives? Think just 'cause you have sidled up to our dad you will now be our mom? Find yourself a guy for a good fuck... Perhaps then you'll have a kid and leave us alone! Could you switch it off? What if your mom turns up? If she turns up... But you are going to be eighteen in autumn. That's just it, in autumn... But everything is happening now! I'm going to leave soon... Perhaps you'd like to come with me? While you settle in, you can stay with my folks... This is your grandpa's house, isn't it? So? Right, you don't give a fuck. I don't give a fuck? What am I to do here? Pick potatoes for pennies? You really think to earn something with your apples? Emergency... Listening... Emergency... Please speak! Bring the wheelbarrow. Don't just stand there. From now on we are not skipping school and you will do your homework! The tests you didn't do.. Give it to me. I said only one. But these are the small ones. You took the chewing-gum. And a prepaid phone card for 3 lats. Raya? What's up with you? My head is splitting. I'm leaving... Hi, Robis! Come here… Perhaps you can use it... I can't take it with me anyway. Sold the car, too… Are you leaving for good? Alright then… I'm sure we'll see each other. Bye Robis! And give my regards to your granny! Hello! Sit down! Calm down! Sit down and stop it! Raya, come with me… Why me? - Just come! I'll deal later with the others. I am told that you are the best choice… for the foreign language competition. But I am not at all convinced given your attendance record… What do you think about it? - Think about what? - Will you go to the competition? - Yes... of course! I hope I won't have to regret it. You will have to attend individual classes. Alright. Here are additional exercises for you to do, okay? Will you make pancakes for dinner? No... eat what's in front of you. - Did you write your essay? - Yes. Give it to me to read. Mom would have made them. Make them yourself. You know how. Okay, so you'll have to work on grammar. Just reading books is not enough. But speaking of the vocabulary… You know what we'll do? Let us do this. Describe yourself using as many adjectives as possible. I don't know... That's silly! I could characterize someone else, not me! Okay, then describe me. I don't know… Alright... Name any adjectives that could be applied to any person. Adjectives. Okay... Lets try it another way! Go ahead. What is that? I don't know. The smiling spider. Don't loiter... And come straight home after school. Understood? And put the soup out in a cool place. But money? And don't walk barefoot on the cold floor. Are you nervous? No… Can we leave now? - We can… - It's all finished in there anyway. Probably. Okay then… You're going to London! Yes... you too. You didn't believe, did you. That I'll get the prize? You are smart and… you are gifted. Why not? How come you know the language so well... You are not attending classes! I guess... thanks to my father. Yes, I heard... about your father... That he… Better tell me how you ended up here? From Riga to nowhere… Usually, it happens the other way around. There was an offer from that young teachers' program and… I wanted a change… to be away from all that, from the city and… to look at things from a different perspective. And did you look? I don't know… You said you have been here before? Yes. We used to come here once in a while... When we had a car. Can I have one too? - I thought you don't smoke. - I don't. Once we were going to buy tractor… father had got a loan. And to celebrate, he bought us ice-cream. The whole box. Then we were eating it up here. I should come here with Robis… and buy a whole box of ice cream again. - Are you cold? - Yes. I would also like to… So.. How do they fit? Cool. It's enough. Take off the sneakers. Maybe they'll stretch. They won't… we'll have to buy new ones. What if mom doesn't live there anymore. Raya? She probably does. Fine roads you have here! I just barely got through. Olga was waiting for you. But… how shall I put it… she's got the runs. And her stomach is all twisted. She's been sitting in the toilet for quite some time. Oh, really? Never mind… I'll wait. I must catch my breath anyway. I'll see how she is doing. It's going to be a while. - That damn thing is contagious. - Really? Well, okay. Signature and date. How much is there? Aren't you coming home? I have a meeting about the graduation party! But pancakes... You promised. Make them yourself... Give them to me. Give them to me. Get off that window! Why don't you wear them in class? Because I don't need them. Can I borrow it? Take it. Crane Street. Are there any cranes in Riga? No… I don't know... Maybe they where there once. I have never been at your house... And you have never been in mine. You're not missing anything. What is your home like? Did she really not see you? I will make you those pancakes. Did she see you? What are your plans today? What plans could I have on a day off? Hello! How is Olga? Fine thanks! I haven't seen her for a while. Not a moment of peace. Grandma used to work here... She was an accountant. Raya, wait. This is for Olga. What is it? Nothing... Usually you are not dressed like this. - I was planning to go for a walk. - OK. Let's go! Are you turning me down? Even if it is my birthday? Really? Seriously? Shall we go? Who gets there first gets the pastry! Not fair! Where's my pastry? When we will see each other again? Likely at 8 a.m. tomorrow, in class. Clean up after yourself! I'm not your mom! Show me your report book! You are not my mom! Are you nuts? Let me in. It's none of your business what my report book says. Are you nuts? I will tell everyone about you! Let me back in! You, stupid cow! Why are you behaving like this? It's so stupid. And you're the smart one... Fucking your teacher in the bushes! Hello there... The road is so rutted. and wet... I didn't want to drive up. Is Olga inside? She is not at home. Where is she? She has taken up going to markets again… I came here on business. I must write a report to the family court about how you are doing… I should take a look. You've rearranged furniture. There's more space and more light now. And you have cleaned the windows. Raya? I know everything. I've known your family for a long time. And I know what you've been through. And I'm very happy that despite everything... things are beginning to look up. Give my regards to Olga. And tell her I need to see her. Bye! Are you angry about that birthday joke? Not now… I only wanted to say that Robis won't tell anything to anyone. I must lock up. Are you totally nuts? Where is the money? Get lost... That was my money too! Money… You... little idiot... So what? You can buy clothes for yourself.. But I don't get anything? Do you realize... we'll have nothing to eat tomorrow? He had a bit too much… went into a ditch. I won't take this after all... Hey little hooligans, what are you doing? Scram! They are stealing our fish! Those who steal fish can get a pole up one's ass! Now I got you! Catch them! No way you can escape! You gonna choke on those fish! Stop it! In a few days in London we'll have the whole week.. And then? Here… a list of colleges. I've marked some of them… if you tried, you could get a scholarship. Will you come for my graduation? Yes, I was planning to. Listen... I must be at the bus station in half an hour. Raya… Raya? I'll go to the kiosk, okay? You have three minutes. Kaspars Vilcans. Raya Kalnina. And for the prize in latgale Regional… foreign language competition... Please sign in our gold book.. Raya? Congratulation! Thank you! Where are all the others? Where is Olga? She will come... Later… I need to go for the graduation photo! Ten point five. Where is Olga? - I don't know. - How can you not know? - I don't know... You mean to tell me that she hasn't come? Come here! Raya… Raya... Let me go! Stand still! - Raya! You have to go back. I wont. I have to find my mom. But how you imagine… How will you get through the airport controls? Probably they are already looking for you. I'm not a criminal. But why are you running? If you don't want to come with me then don't. I have my ticket. Can you lend me some money? You know where I keep my money... don't you? You have to go back. When did you arrive? Olga is dead and Robis is in an orphanage. We need you to come back. Wait here a sec. This is Marcus. He is eight months old. I know... you think I'm the worst mother... and probably it's true. But I can't go back... Please take it. Take care of Robis. Please, forgive me. First, Olga died of a heart attack... Second, Raya came here of her own free will. We are talking about pension, about money fraud… here is the money… That will solve everything, right? She's of legal age now, she has to come herself. But that will solve everything right? - Hopefully. Alright. She'll come herself.
