The election resulted in a landslide victory for the Labour Party. Churchill regretted that he had not ended the war with Japan - but explained that the end can come before you expect it. An invasion in Japan is now inevitable, - -according to to American sources. After huge mine laying operations - the country's fleet is now almost totally paralyzed. Tokyo radio declares, that they have received a message... Do not shoot. - Do not shoot. We are unarmed. - We wanted to go to England. I have money. Here it's yours. Take it all. Do you really have to go? - Ready to go? - Yes. Nils Kant, from Stenvik. Are you heading to Borgholm, Nils? In that case you will have company. We need to talk a little, you and me. As I understand it, you've been spending a lot of time out on the limestone plateau, Nils. Maybe you came across some foreigners out there. I think they're Germans. They're dead. Someone shot them. Was it you, Nils? ECHOES FROM THE DEAD I'm glad you came. Uh... you are beautiful. So beautiful. You're right, I remember you. Cute? Sweet. Sweet is probably better. Gerlof? You have a visitor. Now you see Gerlof. I got it here. Here are all the details. Every ship. Year, destinations, ports, dates. They were more helpful in the Municipal Housing Office. I was allowed to take these copies. Vera Kant's sales between 1965 and 1971. It was a lot of money back then. And here they buy Malm a new ship. And... here. Here he buys another one. - Hello. - Hello. I'm here to see Gerlof Davidsson? - I'm his daughter Julia Davidsson. - Jasa? Hey. Boel Westin. Here he buys an Atlantic cruiser, 'Cruzco' in 1965. Hey. Julia. Welcome. Meet my friend Ernst. You may well remember Ernst, our stonemason? -we always sit in here to work. - Work on what? Gerlof and I think we know a little more about how it happened. - About how what happened? - Nothing. - We think the boy got lost in the fog. - Ernst. - You're busy, you said. - What are you doing? Yes, it'll best if I slip out for a while. It was great to see you again, Julia. It really was. I've come regarding the sale of Stenvik. Nothing else. You should know that only too well. You look cute, Julia. Absolutely beautiful. You are exactly as I remember you. Yes? Fine. I've spoken to the broker. There are no problems - But you need to sign. There. I'm going out to empty the place. If there's anything, you want to keep, let me know. Otherwise... I'll throw it out. I don't understand, why there's a rush to sell it? You can not keep the house anymore. And I need my share of the money. You knew that. - And I'll be back on Monday. - Yes, you told me on the phone. You can sleep in the boathouse now. You were fine in there. And I know that you did not like sleeping in the house. Ernst and I think that Nils Kant came back the summer of '72 - When Jens... - It's over 20 years ago. Why bring it up to now? I will stop by tomorrow before I go back. Ernst needs his glasses. Maybe you could stop by the stone-cutting quarry down the road. - He lives in Marnashjemmet. - It's nice,so I've heard. - It's an amazing place. - Yes. - It must be nice in summer. - Yes. At this time of year it's almost dead round here. Yes. I would have waited until May, when mainland people are here. But, now, we've decided to sell, we might as well get on with it. Ernst! Ernst! Ernst! What are you saying? - How could this happen? - It was an accident, they say. Don't come down here. I just wanted to tell you. - An accident? How can it be? - I do not know. That's what they say. I have to go now. They want to talk to me. I'll stop by later. Hey, hey. ...41127 Gothenburg. Yeah, okay. - Lennart? - Hey, skipper. Here, have a chair. No thanks, I'll stand here. Well, what do you think? Forensics are bringing stuff from Kalmar, but it... It seems as though he has stumbled and fallen down. According to the doctor it happened during the rain last night. - I may need to contact you again. - I'm going to Gothenburg now. Don't run off without letting me know You have my card, right? See you. I'll drive you home. Or should we take a look at Stenvik? If nothing else you'll get to see the house again. He made the finest tombstone on Öland. Yes, I know. He also made mother's. There is room for my name under hers. Can we sleep here tonight? You and me. It would be nice, I think. It is... Perhaps do you good? Okay. But you need to call the home. Let them know you're away tonight. I never really got the hang of these contraptions. I'm not afraid to die anymore. I was. In the past. When I sailed out. Uncertainty... The mines, we had to navigate around them after the war. Now I'm too old to be afraid. I think. Why did you go that day? You know exactly what I mean. How could you leave him alone - with Mum? He was five years old and she was almost completely blind. And you went down to the boathouse to make nets. I understand that it's not.. wasn't... easy to be a single mother. That you needed help with the boy from time to time. And I did help out, as often as I could. But it wasn't working working out, as you'll recall. I understand you had to leave home once in a while. I had a home? I worked to provide for me and Jens. As I worked to support you and Ella. I'm sorry, you still live alone. And I wish you could let go... ...of the terrible guilt. I don't feel guilty. For it is not my fault. Do you remember Vera Kant? The woman who lived here. She was really rich. Lots of land on Öland and a sawmill on the mainland. All that money to no avail. She just sat in his house and longed for her son Nils. - Nils Kant? - Yes. He disappeared after all. But Ernst and I think - Nils Kant came back. And maybe he met Jens out there in the mist of the limestone plain. Jens drowned and washed away in a stream. He's not coming back. Do you not understand that? I have to go. Don't forget that you need to talk to Lennart before you run off. I'll drive past the police station on the way. - See you. - See you. Let me know if you need help. Yes. Yes, that's fine. Yes. Hey, hey. Hey. I'm headed home to Gothenburg. Was there anything more you wanted? Yes, sorry. I should have called. The forensic technicians are satisfied, so we can do the rest over the phone. It was an accident, pure and simple. Yes. Fine. Well, see you then. But maybe I can buy you lunch. It's almost 12 and I'm on my way out. As compensation for not phoning, I mean. And since he retired, I'm the only officer here in Marnas. Yes. You know, we met once before? It was me who led the search for your son. His name was Jens, wasn't it? It was our largest police operation. We looked everywhere. We dragged the water. There were people from Kalmar with dogs... Even a helicopter. Ernst and Gerlof think that he went out on the limestone plain in the fog. That he drowned? They have a theory Nils Kant was involved. - That he came back. - Yes, I wish that were true. Yes, up here we give Nils Kant the blame for all the evils of the world. But it was '72, right? Nils Kant had been dead for four years, so... But... why not? If Jens had gone out on the limestone plain - They would have found him. For sure. Sorry. Can I see that? - The postmark in Borgholm. - No return address. And no letter. Can it really be his...? They looked exactly like this. May I see it? Yes, he did. He sent the sandal to the Forensic Department. There could be traces on it. But on the other hand, he said, it was a fairly common make. Pax. - Who sent it? - Oh, it's so strange. I can not handle this. If it had been in the water - Then it would not look like... as it does. - I just think that... - That he drowned? Exactly. Do you remember what clothes he was wearing that day? Are you sure He had sandals on? If there is someone who knows what he had on, then it's probably you. He was asleep when I left. I thought he was coming down to the boathouse - And helping me with the nets. That's what I told him to do. He was five years old. How could I be so damn stupid - Thinking you could take care of him? I should've known, not to trust you. I stood by his bed, but I didn't have the heart to wake him. Countless times I have wished I could have that day again. And you have far to drive. What will you do? I'll forget it and report in sick at work. I can not take Sahlgrenska right now. The hospital owes me a few sick days. I must also go over mother's things again. Hell, Jens! Fuck! Hello? Hello? Oh, hi. Hows things? Maybe you can help me. Excuse me, could you tell me how I can find the Lamberts' place? Excuse me. Lamberts, you say? - Yes, it's been so long since last time. - When you get back on the road, After a few kilometers you will come to a milk churn. So I can find it. Thank you. - Hello. - Hello. Are there any adults at home? Oh. Hey. - I am looking for Oskar Lambert. - Yep. Dad passed away almost ten years ago. Well. I'm so sorry. - Can I buy some eggs? - Yes. Over here. Some considered my father to be psychic. But he could see nothing really. I assume that's why you're here. It's a long time since he died, but there are still people... I really just want to apologize. For Oskar. - For what? What happened? - Well... I beat him up once. I was upset at the time. I didn't mean it. So I know who you are. Julia Davidsson. Right? It was your son who disappeared. I asked Oskar sleep in Jen's bed. He saw things in his dreams. He had to find out what had happened to Jens and help find him. Father had a special ability. I remember that time. He dreamed your son Jens was dead, right? Yeah. And I was totally distraught. I wouldn't believe it, so I hit him. Right in the face. I wanted to apologize. Father spoke very often about that one dream. That your boy did not drown, as everyone else said - But it happened in the fog out on the limestone plain. He could not get the thought from his head. And there was a man in the dream. A man? So... who was it? What did he look like? No, he... He just said that it was a man, that was filled with hatred. That's what he said. A man who was filled with hatred. Mama! "Nils Kant. Died 1968 in Havana"? Yes, none of the other freighters would bring him back, so we had to. I assume, Vera Kant was here. - Were there others? - No. She was the only mourner. I had never seen her before in church. She wept, but it seemed a little 'put on'. It was a tense time. Others have thought that the coffin was empty but it was heavy as stone. - Maybe it was stone. - Yeah, maybe. We'll see if anyone ever comes and digs it up one day. Julia? - Astrid! - Oh, but hey. - Hello. It's been a long time. - Yes. He invited me to lunch to The Moby Dick. - Sounds great. - Today's special. Lasagna. It was not so great, but there was nothing wrong with Lennart. No, he's a good man. A shame that he lives alone. - But he has reasons. - Well? The officer Nils Kant shot, was Lennart's father. What? Lennart's father? Nils Kant really did stir things up. So it is not surprising that there are stories told about him in the twilight hours. Some think that, yes, he stole a lot of gold from the Germans. A horde he used to live the high-life in America. Others believe he never left the island, but was still living in Vera Kant's house. People have seen shadows in the house. Tracks in the snow. - Hello. - Hello. What the heck? - I thought you had left. - No, it didn't happen. - I'll stay a few more days. - Okay. Come inside. I've been on the go since four o'clock this morning. There is a senile old man, who disappeared on the limestone plain. I've been looking for him and organized the local military. - Did they find him? - No, not yet. And soon it'll be too late. The nights are getting colder. - Would you like some coffee? - No thanks. I just wanted to stop by. I dashed off a little quickly yesterday. Yes, I thought you wanted to have some time alone with Gerlof. It's about the sandal... I see. I've sent it to the lab. We will see what they say. We shouldn't get our hopes up too soon - But something just might show up. And I've got your number. I promise to call if it does. Yes. Well, I'm out of here. See you. One more thing. I was out yesterday - And I thought, there was light on in Vera Kant's house. - I thought it was unoccupied. - It has been empty since the 70s. - So, maybe you are wrong? - Yeah, maybe. See you. I was wondering if you wanted to have dinner with me tonight. Unless you have something else planned. Certainly. POLICEMAN murdered JENS DISAPPEARING in the fog It was in 1968. SANDAL ERNST DEAD - ACCIDENT? Hey. Come inside. I bought some eggs from Lambert's instead of flowers. It ebbed away a few years ago. We were... Hmm, what can I say? We were quite different people. But... we stuck together for almost eight years. She had children from an earlier relationship. Pontus and Maja. And, ah, they are doing great now. 15 and 17 Really lovely kids. They keep in touch from time to time. I wish I'd been their father. It would have been cool. - And you? - No, a few brief relationships. some a little longer. I have not been able to cope the idea of having children. It may sound strange, but it would have felt like I betrayed him. Sometimes I wonder, what if he's alive? He would have celebrated his 26th in April. That he would have had a good job and maybe a girlfriend. Suddenly one day he'd be standing outside the door. You know what I think? I think that the best way to get through a deep sorrow - Is keep moving forward and do not look back. Yes. Perhaps that's how it should be. I've tried. But it's not fucking easy. No. In a way, we are quite similar, you and me. Lonely. And we carry a deep sadness. But there is a difference. I have accepted it - It happened... My father was murdered. So it won't work, unless you're able to let go. The difference is that you know what happened. I do not know. Yes. No... Can you call a taxi for me? It gets expensive. At this time of night - They have to come up from Borgholm. Uh-huh. But if you like, you can... You may sleep here. LOCK THE DOOR AND LEAVE THE KEY UNDER MAT - Hello? - It is Gerlof Davidsson. I've got a little boy's sandal in the mail. And I think it is you who sent it. Hello...? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? OFFICER FOUND DEAD PURSUIT OF KILLER CONTINUES NILS 23 May 1943 Hello? What? Is there anyone here? Speak up if anyone's here! What are you doing here? - What? Are you hurt? - No, it's okay. - But someone has dug in the basement. - What? Hey. Hello, Gerlof. Yes, you've obviously got your daughter to believe that Nils Kant lives - And lives here in Vera Kant's old house. I have never claimed that he was hiding here. - She could have broken her neck. - Well... So, in that case, this must be Nils Kant's 'Göteborg Rape-Seed Snuff'. You don't see it too often around here. - Can you drive? - Yes, it's fine. Will I be charged with burglary now? Oh no. Not by me, at least. And it does look as though there has been others here before you. - Can we we talk later? - Yes, certainly. - Okay. - Okay, yes. Lennart and you are getting to know one another? So it seems. - How was Ernst's funeral? - It was fine. However, there are constantly fewer in the pews. Because, well, there's fewer of us left. - Turn in here. - Why? Turn in here. I need to talk to John about something. No thanks. I think Reverend Högström was divinely inspired. Yes, I guess you could say. Someone from the mainland is making the headstone. It is well nigh inconceivable that someone should take over the stone-cutting business. It must be incredibly difficult to get your head around it. Is this your tin, John? No, it's Anders' The guy you met briefly the other day. I did not know you used snuff, Gerlof. Take as much as you like. I think Anders has dug Vera Kant's basement up. Whoever did it left a snuff box similar to this one. Anders has probably heard tales - Of Nils Kant's German gold treasure. And Anders is a little... ...different. He has been struggling to pay his tax for many years. You should probably call Lennart, John. Oh well. Here we go. I found them in Kant's house. Watch. I've never seen a picture of Nils Kant. But here he is. How he looked then. How I remember him. Nothing written on them. Strange. "Havana, 71" - Nils may indeed have sent them. - He was definitely buried in 68 Or there were stones in the coffin. Anders Hagman admitted to the me, he had dug in the basement. Uh-huh. - Did he find any treasure? - No. There has been so much talk of money. It does not exist. Oh, I had completely forgotten. Look here. I found these upstairs in Vera Kant's house. Take a look. From Havana. Gerlof think it is Nils Kant, who sent them to Vera. But I think he was alive... no, here... ...in 1971, he could also be alive today. Now I'll tell you something, I have not told anyone else. Because my father was murdered by Nils Kant - I helped to open his casket. It was against all the rules, but... Therefore, I have not told anyone. The coffin was sent from South America with Borgholm of Gothenburg - The death certificate and all. And there was a doctor from Kalmar too, present. And it was not a pretty sight, I can tell you... Kant had been in the water a long time, with all that that entails. But he had a fracture - Here on the left hand. On these two fingers. Nils Kant had been in an accident - When he worked at the port as a child. Exactly the same fracture. And in September 1968 Nils Kant was buried - On Marnas cemetery. And some years later his mother Vera died. And since then no Kant has lived on Öland. Not one. You... I would like you to stay here tonight. To be completely honest - I am quite confused about all this. I thought, It would be best to sleep at Stenvik instead. Okay. - I think we can talk tomorrow. - Yes. Later... Would you be so kind as to tell me where we're going? We're going to visit Martin Malm. The vessel was Malm Cruzco, - That carried Nils Kant's coffin home from Havana - In 1968. Ore Ore Shipping. That's him, right? Yep. And I think it was Ores, - Who sent Jens' sandal by mail. Why didn't you say so? - You've been quite angry lately. - Anyway. How did you find out about it? Why should Malm have had Jens' sandal? On 12 august 1972. It was five days before the thick fog on the limestone plain. That day The Santos, another of Malm's Atlantic freighters, docked at Gothenburg - Carrying sugar from Havana. - What's this got to do with Jens? - I do not know. But I think Malm may have something to say to us. If not, he did not send the sandal. Yes, Malm had already bought the house in the sixties. He let them renovate the property. Was that Martin Malm? I am Gerlof Davidsson, a good friend of Martin. Nicholas. I work for home care. Martin says he has been robbed, but there is nothing missing. - Have you called the police? - No, he's gone to hospital. He was completely in shock. The police can talk to him there. - Sure. - Yes. Thank you. There is one more thing. Vera Kant didn't just sell her properties. She also bought one. - An apartment in Kalmar. - Uh-huh? I have the address. Maybe we should go there. - Kant may live there. - Do you have any proof of that? Yes, I think so. Come with me, Julia. - Maybe we can have dinner later. - Thanks, but I have plans tonight. Southern North Sea: Smooth fresh southerly or south-westerly winds. Afternoon increasing winds. Moderate visibility. The northeastern North Sea... ... he wears song he... Hello, my gay brothers it squeaks under your heels it is a winter out if you want made this way then we go back to Söder it squeaks under your heels Are you Swedish? Yes, you can not hear it? Bengtsson. Arvid Bengtsson. The damn ship has left the country without me. What kind of a ship? And now I stand here in Havana. The ship? Tannenberg, a freighter. If one can call it a ship. It is soulless, if you ask me. It is registered in Hamburg. How the hell do I get home? It will be all right. We always get back home. Sooner or later. You can stay with me for a while. You're nice. - Fritiof. - Fritiof... You are a tolerant guy Fritiof. Let us sit down and empty the bottle here, huh? No, I can not concentrate! No, no! You must carry the boxes out of the car. He was a fine boy. I know how you feel. If anyone could, I know how you feel. You... And now I have... Now I've met you. Yes. Thank you. I got a fine turbot from a neighbor yesterday. It is at home in the fridge. Why do not we eat some lunch? It sounds quite irresistible. Okay. At half-past eleven, so. It's grandma's old recipe. The best there is. Gerlof is not here. He took the bus to Kalmar. He's visiting a hospital. But he is back in the afternoon, he said. But you extended, Martin. Bought up land. And built new. It must have cost money. And as far as I can see - Vera Kant contributed a great deal. Or was it something else? Martin? Who was it that was in the chest, transported to Sweden by The Cruzco - From Cuba in 1968? How are you, Arvid? It does not look so good, does it? Hold on, I'll help you. So you might say that it was Vera Kant, who saved Malm Shipping. - I needed the money. - Uh-huh. So little Malm Shipping from Öland suddenly - Is competing with larger companies. We could not believe our eyes when we saw The Amelia - Moored at the quay in Borgholm. What a ship. Even then I wondered where the money came from. And what did Vera Kant ask of you - For all the money? Where are you from? How the hell did you get here? What? I'm wondering, where you come from. You have not told me anything. What? Surely I'm allowed to ask? I have lived with you for... ...several months and... You never say anything. You never mention, where you came from. Or how you got here. Not a damn thing, actually. If you really want to know, I come from Öland. And the reason I'm here is that I killed two German soldiers. And a cop. I had to swim to the mainland, go to Gothenburg and find a ship. And then I ended up here. Fritiof. Couldn't you come up with something better? - Why don't we have a little rum? - No, come here. - Surely we can dance a little? - Come on. We need to go this way. Hola senorita Arvid, here, here. - This direction. - You are so boring. What the hell? Now I'm soaked. Stop it. Fritiof. Stop it. Help! No! If I had not helped Nils Kant to get home, - the boy would have been alive today. Jens would have been 26 years old. But I still don't fully understand, Martin. Nils Kant Killed Jens? Or...? Is that why you sent the sandal? Because you wanted it to be known? Hey. Nils Kant returned. Apparently he shot Jens out on the limestone plateau that day. We'll talk about it later. I came here to ask Malm about the alleged burglary, but... I'll just do it another day. It looks like he should be resting. - I'm going to Marnas. Do you want to? - Yes, please. It's good of you. Vera Kant and Martin Malmsten did business together. She paid a tidy sum to get her son back home. She had to sell everything she owned, and it was no small amount. The sawmill on the mainland, as well. And I think that Nils Kant was at home in Stenvik on that day. He must have encountered Jens in the fog on the limestone plain. And for some reason he murdered Jens. But what happened to Nils Kant? Where did he go after that? When Martin feels better, I'll question him about it. Well, good thing you're a cop. Otherwise, we'd have been done for speeding. Why turn off here? Lennart? I'll not take you all the way to Stenvik, Nils. I do not want anyone to see the car. I have to drop you off further out on the limestone plain. We must take the small roads. It does not matter. I've already waited this long. Fine. And if there's one place I know well, it's here. - It was an accident. -What was an accident? No, Gerlof has not shown up. The bus just got here, and the next comes along at five o'clock. Okay. Thank you. That's fine, see you. What are we doing here? You have to take me home now! But... No! Get off me! What is happening? What happens is that senile, Old men go wild on the limestone plain. So you know what happened to Jens? - I'm going home to Stenvik now. - Wait, Nils. The bus to Böda is running 20 minutes late. We may as well wait for it to turn up? We shouldn't take any chances now, eh? Nils? I'm going. Mother is waiting. You've got your money. - Our partnership stops here. - Wait, Nils! Nils. Wait. There is someone heading this way, who would like to meet you, Nils. Yes. That's it. Wait here. Now I actually... I have risked a great deal. I think that... You've got your money. Wait. Nils... Wait! Are you lost? Yes, I think so. Nothing will happen to you. I know it well around here. - What's your name? - Jens. - And last name? - Davidsson. Jens Davidsson. - My name is Arvid. - And last name? Bengtsson. Arvid Bengtsson. I'll help you, Jens. I think I know where you live. Here we go. - I could not help it! - You were there! It was an accident. Is it so hard to understand? Lennart? Lennart... Lennart. Lennart! - What the hell? - I came as fast as I could. Is that him there? What do you think? Where the hell have you been? He's completely insane. I could not hold him. I've waited so long to meet you, Nils Kant. The man who murdered my father. - Lennart. - Yes? If only you and Ernst had let it go. What's done is done. I can not do anything about it. How could you live with it? You can not just pretend it was nothing. I had to choose. I could not do anything about it, it just happened. But Jens? Of course I wish he were not there. That it had not happened. What the hell could I have done Gerlof? Not a damn thing. And then you buried them Here on the limestone plain? No, we waited for the next day. Until Nightfall. We buried them at the Western Wall of Marnas cemetery. It was horrible. It took us all night. so It wasn't visible the next day. And the sandal? I do not know why Martin kept it. And the night before were you with the search party for Jens? And now Julia. What do you want? Will you continue to carry around this secret? Or do you think... Do you think - She will forgive you? Julia will never forgive this. Never. Lennart. No. Damn! Fuck! Hello? Hello? - Dad? - Julia Take the exit on the right. And then you drive to the east, the road ends. I'll find it. It's the police. Phone. It's too late, Lennart. I have spoken to Julia. Yes, I'm arriving now. Good. Father! - How are you? - I'm cold, but I'm all right. There will be help here soon. No! It was you. It was an accident. I... You didn't need to know about it. Did not need to know about it? What the hell, man? For over 20 years, I accused my father. He had to live with the guilt. And just as often I accused myself. But it was your fault all the time. Only yours. Come on. Yes, Dad. I got the job in Marnas. That's great. I was thinking that maybe we can arrange a bedroom downstairs for you.
