THE ROCKET (radio): What a sorry sight, what a tragedy! Crowds are ransacking the streets of Montreal. St. Catherine St is being looted. We might not be able to broadcast the end of the game which was interrupted after the first period. - There's no reason why we cannot finish this game. - There's a riot outside. - We cannot afford to lose. This is Detroit! lt's the end of the goddamn season! - We want everybody out. The game is over! - Yellow-bellied...! (radio): l am first and foremost a hockey fan myself, and l'm telling you right now, this doesn't smell good. They couldn't have picked a worst time. Obviously, those hockey fans out there, hockey fans who have spontaneously transformed themselves into looters and vandals have all but forgotten that the Canadiens are trying to keep Detroit out of first place. (players yelling) Montreal, 1937 - The Duplessis Era - - Maurice! We're meeting at my place. They're spreading rumours of layoffs. Don't believe them. They're trying to scare us. So they can earn more money off us. They blame the Depression, but it's to intimidate us. - l can't. - See you tonight. - lt's just hockey. You don't have to come. - Need a hand? - Lucille, you're 13 years old. We're 1 7. - You got heart. l like that. l heard you work 'cause your folks are in need. ls that right? That's a shame. But hey, l guess at least you have a job. What did you and L?veill? talk about? Someone saw you and L?veill? talking. Now, what did L?veill? want? Alright. After your shift, you stay for the trash in the back. (end-of-shift whistle blowing) - First line... Maurice, Laurier, Bertrand. Second: Georges, St-Onge... - Stuart wants to coach the Royals. - The only team that beat us is Auto Parts. They're bigger, so we have to outskate them. l want to see you move! Get going! - Hurry up! - Come on, Maurice! Don't give up, guys! Keep at it! - Keep going! Way to go! - You can do it! - Get over here! Here, l said! 43 wins in 46 games... That's a season you'll always be proud of. You'll crow that for an entire season 10 punks from Lafontaine Park terrorized the junior league. But believe me... Every time you start to brag, people will ask you: Did you win the finals? Right now, it's no. You have two minutes to change the outcome. This is about who you are! Got it? Bertrand, James, St-Onge, Bernard! Philippe! Let's go! - Don't talk to me! - Maurice! Maurice! - Go, Maurice! (cheering) - Help yourselves! (music playing) - Want to dance? - No. - l'll show you. - No. - lt's easy. - No. - You can be such a moron! - My brother might not like me being alone with you. Don't you like parties? You're not very chatty. - l don't make small talk. - Will you tell my brother l kissed you? - World War ll - (tramway bell) (cars honking) (whining) - He'll be right out. Georges! Georges! - Mr Norchet? - What? - May l talk to you? Mr Norchet, l'd like... to ask your... permission to marry your daughter, Lucille. - ls there any...? Did you know...? - What? - Why have a freezer if...? Did you know...? Look... Look, Maurice... How will you provide for her? You're a swell guy. But you're asking a father to marry his daughter to a machinist. - He's going to play for the Habs. - What do you mean? - He's been invited to their training camp. - Maurice, didn't you break your ankle? - lt healed well, Mr Norchet. - And an arm this year? - No, that wasn't... - The army rejected you. The RCAF don't even want you as cannon fodder. Think the Habs will sign you? - lt's just a try-out. l had a good season. - l like you. But as far as we're concerned... - Mr Norchet... - Last spring you were off to fight Hitler. Now you're joining the Habs. What's next? Prime Minister? Maybe he won't be poor all his life. But he is now. How long have you courted? - l'm going to marry him! - Lucille, l haven't finished! Lucille! You're not 18. Lucille! The answer is no! - Big smile, everybody! Mr Norchet? Smile! (people yelling next door) (dog barking outside) (music over the radio) - You were hoping for better? Maurice Richard. - Mr Blake, how was your summer? - That's none of your business. - Here. - Here's my wish list. Don't tell me it's impossible. Were you about to tell me it's impossible? - Well... - What'd l just tell you? - Mr lrvin, these are tops. We have no money. - l'm here to win, not finish close second, not put on a good show. l don't even care about team spirit. l need players who hate to lose! - l hate to lose, Mr lrvin. - No, you don't. Gentlemen! Please. Please? Welcome to the Canadiens. We are looking for some good hockey players. We'd like to win a few games this year. People do not like to see us play. lt's pretty much the same story throughout the league. Right now, the game of hockey is not a ticket seller. l'm telling you exactly the same thing all the other coaches in the NHL are telling their players at this very moment. The league, the NHL, is this close to folding. So, gentlemen, it's up to you. Make this game exciting! - Go! Go! Go! - l'd like to thank all of you. These are the cuts for today. Jeff O'Neil. Greg Hunt. - Cut means out? - Yeah. - Fred Hearly. Michel Gosselin. Skip Taylor. - You skate well, but keep your head up, or they'll clobber you. - Marcel Julien. Rod Norwood. Len Rowlston. Duke Lamer. Wildor Laprade. Ab McCreedy. Everybody else, back here tomorrow, dressed, ready to go at two. - Maurice Richard. - Yes. - Fractured left ankle? Ankle? - Yes. - Fractured wrist? Which one? - My left. - l'm Dr McKay. l'm gonna have to have you for a once-over. Philip Smith. (air-raid siren) - lt's a blackout drill. - They really think the Krauts will land here? - Are they signing you? - This is all, with ration coupons. - l have steak. lt makes my dad happy. - Where is it? - Maurice. Maurice. - Tell your dad we're fine. - He's not tough enough for big-time hockey. - D'you see his eyes when he gets close to the net? - He's been injured. - He's done a great camp. - Let's keep Andy Perron. - l want Richard. - Mr lrvin, you know we're in no position to waste money. - Test him. - What do you mean, test him? - Test him. Let's see what he's got. Hey, buddy. - You married a... player with the Canadiens. - l knew it! (crying) - Welcome to big-time hockey! - Cold beer! Cold beer! - Ready, children? Louise, what does a good girl do when she wakes up? - She says her prayers. - Good. And then? - She slowly eats a tasty bowl of Robin Hood oatmeal! - Louise couldn't have put it better. What a treat for kids, a steaming bowl of Robin Hood oatmeal before heading to school. Dick lrvin takes advantage of the whistle to change his line. He sends in the Comet, the young player who some already compare to Howie Morenz. (crowd cheering) (laughing) - l'd like to toast number 15, the Comet. - Georges... - They call you that. - To the Comet! l was standing, in the section for the poor. That section has a fence around it. So we can't bother the rich. A fence! The poor are in a cage! - You looked at a house? - A house? - We just looked. - Maurice... lf you could get me tickets... not the best... - Georges, it's Christmas. Drop it! - Lucille, do you go? - There are seats for the wives. - At every game? - At each game they wear new dresses. Sometimes notjust the dress is new - the wife is too! - Maurice! - l'm your brother-in-law. You're on the team thanks to me. l told Paquette to take you in the junior league. That's when it all started, right? - Merry Christmas! - So how can l get tickets? - Marry a hockey player. - Get home safely. - A house? - Don't start! - They don't have the money! December 27, 1942 (radio): ln the first period, Richard had a goal and two assists. What's the Comet have in store for us now? The puck is in the Habs' end. Cowley has the puck. Maurice grabs it, dekes Jackson. Maurice accelerates powerfully! What a burst of speed! Maurice gets hammered. He hit a wall named Jack Crawford. Crawford waited for the rookie at the blue line. A brutal check! Richard is lying motionless. - l said this would happen! (radio):The referee stops play. The players push and shove. Maurice still down. Dr McKay runs onto the ice. - ... We knew he was frail. lt seems the Canadiens signed a lemon... A lemon that's easily crushed. If he finishes first, it'll be on the injuries list. Our sources say he broke his ankle. The kind of break that never heals. The kind that put an end to the career and life of the great Howie Morenz. - Frank, it's Tommy Gorman. Have l got a deal for you: Maurice Richard. Yeah, well, he's got eleven points. He's tough as nails. He'd be good for Detroit. - And what about Boston? - Dick, we signed a lemon. - l signed a lemon. - At the Forum, Dick lrvin could not hide his dismay. lt didn't take much for the Habs coach to admit that Richard is too frail to play in the NHL. Richard's career will be limited to a measly 5 goals and 6 assists. - What a lousy team! - Richard's a bum! They sure missed the boat with him. Money wasted on a loser! - He's a washout! RlCHARD TOO FRAlL (dog barking outside) - They're vultures! l'm pregnant. l'll make supper. - Lucille? Lucille? Did l hear right? - Yes. - lt's only a rough patch. You'll see. 1943-1944 Season - Come on, let's show some piss and vinegar out there! Come on. Get it over here, for chrissake! (crowd booing) Come on, Toe. Let's go. You've been drinking? - A fine. For drinking. - Now, gentlemen, l would like you to think about what is so difficult about putting... this little thing... into that great big thing. - Coach, it hasn't been-- - Mr. Blake! As soon as you stop turning a bright shade a yellow every time you should be going in the corner for the puck, you'll be allowed to speak in this room. Now, those of you who do not understand the importance of winning... those who think that this is only a game... are invited to leave this team. Alright. Richard, you'll be sitting this one out. That's what l want! - l married a winner. - Can l meet him? - l'll come to all your games. - You don't get it. They're letting my contract run out. - l'll watch every goal you score. l'll be there. l'll be so proud. - Maybe l am just a machinist. - Maurice... - Will you come watch me sweep the shop floor? Will you be proud then? They don't give me a chance! How can l prove myself if l can't play? - Richard? People are saying you're a waste of money. A waste of money! You're playing tonight. - Put on something nice. l'm playing. (crowd cheering) - We've had some bad times, Senator, but something's changed. Everybody's in top shape. Blake, Bibeau, Lach, Bouchard. - And Maurice? He's been off for two weeks now. - Yeah, Maurice is doing great. lt'd be a good time to trade him. - Trade him? Tommy... What are you saying? - He got hurt again last night. - No, he wasn't. - He dislocated his shoulder. - They put it back in place. He finished the game. What are you saying? You were there. You saw the game. Open your-- He's playing better hockey. - With a little bit of money, we could get a really good player. - Are you telling me how to do my job? - He's gonna fall apart. We know it, you know it. You know it damn well! - l've never seen another player go to the net like he does. Nobody can take the puck away from him. - He's your responsibility. - l'd like you to meet Huguette. She's beautiful. She weighs 9 pounds. - 9 pounds? l'll score one for you tonight. - What about me? - l'll score two. - Maurice. Tonight, you'll be playing right wing with Toe and Elmer. - This is the big time. - Pass the puck. - Mr lrvin? l can change 15... for the number 9? - Yeah. - Thank you. She wanted to see me. - On radio they call you guys the Punch Line. They talk about nothing else. - Did they say l scored two goals? - Yes. They said beyond a doubt, you deserved your spot. lrvin says you're the league's top offensive player. - You'll wake her. - You showed them. They call you the Rocket. - She's so beautiful! - l know. - Look, it's Maurice Richard! - Explain something to me. Slowly, l'm just a barber. Last year the Canadiens finished in the cellar. Now, with you and Durnan, they win the Cup. - They could never have done this without you. You got the job done. You brought the Cup back. You! - Let's go. Let's go. - Maurice, it's crazy. We won the cup! - Yeah, we won the Cup. - The first game of the semis, you weren't much. The second started no better. lrvin must have blasted you, 'cause you set the ice on fire. What did lrvin say after the first period? What did lrvin say to you? - Nothing. - And what's your excuse, Mr Rocket? Because the way you're playing, we haven't got a snowball's chance in hell of winning. You Frenchies are all alike. lt is in your blood! You are nothing but a cowardly, no-spunk, no-stiff-upper-lip, chicken droppings! (crowd): Maurice! Maurice! Maurice! Maurice! - Here are tonight's stars... - Now that was one of a hell of a performance. The first, from the Canadiens, number 9, Maurice Richard! - The Rocket! - He scored 5 goals! - The second star... - Durnan! - Maurice Richard! - The third star... - Not Maurice again? - Maurice Rocket Richard! - All three stars! - They're not gonna leave till you go out. (crowd): Maurice! Maurice! Maurice! Maurice! (loud cheering) - After dazzling us in the play-offs... After filling the Forum and other arenas, why weren't you chosen for the All-Stars? You deserved it more than anybody. The league bigwigs... - lt's their decision... (knocking on the window) - Beat it, you scamps! They don't see you around much. 1944-45 Season (end-of-shift whistle blowing) - Good luck tonight. - Thanks. - Program! Program! - Cold beer! - Detroit gave the Rocket a rough time. They were all over him. ln the third, the Rocket was up against big Seibert. He bent real low, his face grazing the ice, to outskate Seibert. - Hey, over here! We're thirsty too! - Seibert was waiting. He slammed into Maurice! - Did he break his ankle? - Maurice got up, with the puck, lugging big Seibert on his back! (loud cheering) At this rate he'll beat Malone's record of 44 goals in a season. - Four bits says he doesn't. - Excuse me! He'll end the season with 50 goals, one per game. - A buck says he doesn't. - Maurice is married to my sister. He's my brother-in-law. - Can't he get you better tickets? - That's no good! No goal! That's a penalty! That's a penalty! Goddamn! What's wrong with you people in Montreal? Richard! Richard! You're no good. You're just a bum! - Smythe, go play big shot in Toronto! - Richard? You damn French pea soup! - You damn yellow! Why don't you just go back to Toronto? - Madame Richard? Madame Richard, l'm Conn Smythe. l'm manager of the Maple Leafs. l will personally write you a cheque for $125,000 if you get your husband to sign a contract with Toronto. - You could play defence. - Last game he wasn't so mean. - Dill's from a famous boxing family. - Mr Desroches! Will ''Killer'' Dill play tomorrow? - The commissioner sees no reason to stop Dill from playing. - Dill was banned for life in the U.S. league. - The commissioner says another league's ruling doesn't apply. - He nearly killed a player! - Mr Gorman sent a letter of protest: ''Players are sent on to the rink to trip, hook, slash - in a word, to demolish Richard.'' He wants the refs to protect him. Gentlemen... - Good luck! - ln New York everyone's talking. Everyone knows that a Habs player is going to get beaten up at the Garden. December 1 7, 1944 - Why don't we just not play him? - And what do we tell the press? - He's hurt. He's got a broken whatever. Definitely something to believe. - No, Tommy! lf we do that, they win. l will not let them win. - Dill is gonna kill him. - Tommy, l will not let the other team's coach tell me who l can play and who l can't play. - Maurice, stay away from Dill. (crowd booing) - Loser! - Let's go. (loud cheering) - He can't even skate. - Blake, Lach, Mosdell. Let's go. Eddolls, Fillion, Richard. Maurice, come back! Blake, Lach. Richard. Get him off the ice! Maurice! Durnan! Get him off the ice! Get him off now! (crowd shouting) No! (crowd going silent) (crowd booing) (crowd shouting) - Come on, you goddamn Frenchman! Hey, pea soup, l'll give you what you want! Come here. (crow booing) Come on. Lucky shot! - l've seen many battles. l saw Armstrong KO Eddy Shore... and ''Peg'' Cleghorn, one of the meanest players in history, in 50 scraps. This is the first time l've seen a player knock out his adversary with one punch. (radio): Maurice has given a severe lesson to the guy called the Killer. Let all third-rate players who try to stop the Habs by harassing Richard take note: The Rocket doesn't like being pushed around. December 28, 1944 - l have the keys. - Aren't your teammates helping? Elmer, Toe, Butch... Fillion. - Lucille? What's wrong? Let's go. - Will we be alright? - Why wouldn't we? - Maybe we should stay here. - Why wouldn't we be alright? - lf something happens, and you're hurt? lt won't, but... - Hey, brother-in-law! How's it going? - Program! - He moved? - All day. - l bet $2 on Detroit. And $5 that Maurice won't score. - $10 says he scores! - $10 it is. 8 points! 5 goals, 3 assists. 8 points in one game! You said you were beat. You weren't sure you could play. - l was beat. - Beat? That's a record. My wallet's hurting tonight. l not only bought my ticket, l lost a bet. - What bet? - You spent the day moving! - What did you bet? - l bet you wouldn't score. - You bet against me! - First time. - l could get fired for that. - l lost the bet. - What if you'd won? - No sweat, l always lose. - No more betting! - lf l sat in a section where they don't bet... - 8 points... Will we be looking for a bigger flat now? (car honking) - Lucille? - Take the wheel. Lucille? Lucille? What did l do now? - You're not the problem. - Then what? - They hit you with their sticks! lf you quip, ''l'm hard-headed,'' l'll kill you! You have a family. You shatter records, fill arenas, but the league doesn't protect you. Why? They protect every star player but you! - lt'll be alright. February 1 7, 1945 - Were you going for the record tonight? - Not at all. l played the best l could, and the club won. - That was spectacular hockey. The Canadiens won. You put two in. How'd you do it? Uh, l, uh... Strong player... l mean... lf these strong player check me, l should be good pareil. (all talking at once) - Maurice... you tied Joe Malone's benchmark 44 goals in one season. With your next goal, you'll own a league record that's been standing for 27 years. Now, what's a record like that mean to you? - lt is good. (laughter) - They talk about the game, the record... and your lousy English. - They say l'm dumb? - Hi, Maurice. You know what they're trying to do to you, Maurice. Now what are you gonna do about it? - Mr Richard, l've seen all of your games in Toronto. You are the most exciting player l have ever seen. But seriously, do you absolutely have to set all the records against Toronto? l would appreciate... - What steams me is that their arenas are full 'cause of one guy. This guy here. We have to be ten times better. l have four brothers. They can all outskate Frank. - Keep it down. What gets me is the reporters, even in Montreal, who say that if the best players weren't overseas, you'd never have beat Malone's record. No one mentions that Malone set his record during World War l! - l wonder why! - Conn Smythe in Toronto has never hired a French player! Not one! What do the bosses speak? Like in factories - they speak English to us. lt's normal, they're English. lt's a free country. But when they give instructions in English, we answer in English. Why? French is barred on the bench! L?o? Let's stop pretending things are fine. You have to take a stand. You're notjust bad at interviews in English. You're bad in French too. - Butch... - No, you stink! - ?mile! - Why? - lf Babe Ruth hits five homers, he says, ''Next time l'll hit 10.'' What you say, ''lt's not me, it's my stick.'' - Hey, hey, Maurice. (all talking at once) Montreal Forum February 25, 1945 (loud cheering) - He scores! What a goal! (radio): Here's Toe Blake. What's he doing? He grabs the puck from the net. He waves it to Joe Malone, who's with us tonight. l'm all choked up. (crowd): Maurice! Maurice! Maurice! Maurice! (crowd): Maurice! Maurice! Maurice! Maurice! (radio): We're witnessing a record ovation that's lasted 10 minutes. (radio): The spectators stamped their feet in joy. - l never worked as hard and was never shadowed as closely. Maybe luck was smiling on me. - ''Luck was smiling on me?'' No, you were extraordinary, you earned it. l've never seen a game like tonight's. ln front of the biggest crowd in the regular season. People from all over Quebec came to see this once-in-a-lifetime moment. - That's very nice. l'm very happy, because... l'm proud of this 45th goal. l set a record that, l believe... brings honour to all French Canadians. - That's great. - You're the hero of a spectacular achievement seen by over 14,000 people... the hero of sports fans across this city and province. We're proud of you. On behalf of all of us, l thank you. Seven years later... LAST GAME OF THE SEMl-FlNALS - April 8, 1952 - - Boys, go tidy your room. (panting) Maurice? - Yes. - My dad will take me to the Forum. That reporter, Paul St-Georges, called to ask if l gave you his messages. Could he stop calling here? l need grocery money. Need help? - No. - Do you have to play? CKAC wants to talk to you. For an interview on the 28th. Six leagues want you to ref their finals. You don't have to accept. - Say yes. - Maurice. - l've no choice. - My brother called. (sighing) lt's the seventh match. You help the entire province. But not my brother. You never ask them for anything! Thank you. - Maurice! - Hello. - Paul St-Georges. - l'm very sorry, l don't have time. - lt's not for an interview, l... - Mr St-Georges, l have a game. - Two minutes! Pea soup! l'd be grateful for two minutes. For years you've been biting your tongue. We'd like to publish your opinions in our paper. - Not me. - l'd write for you. You'll give me your opinion, and l'll write something to make them bigwigs react. For example... How many times have you won the scoring title? - Never. - Never! The other teams cheat. They give assists to their stars even if they're off ice. So l'll write that's the reason the Rocket has never won the scoring title. - No. - Other reporters don't have the guts to tell the truth. lt's important, so things can change. - That's two minutes. - lt's important or we'll always be starting over. lt'll always be the same thing. - Mr Selke. - Maurice. - l was wondering if it would be possible for you to help me with a problem l have with... my brother-in-law. - Yeah, sure. Anything. Come on in. - This is real swell. You've got the right man for... That's for sure. With me, there's never a problem. lt's not because l'm related to... that l'd ask for... l'm very accommodating! - Whatever happens, stay here. - How will l see the game? Hey... Maurice wanted me to see the game. - No. You're okay. Then check your skate for cement. Something's got be slowing you down. Maybe you're too old. Maybe we can fix you up with a walker. Put some little blades on it. Or we can ask the youngster to help you skate around. l don't wanna see Maurice tonight, l want the Rocket! Montreal Forum Boston vs Canadiens - Second Period - Boys, boys. - Watch number 9. Don't let him go by. Alright? We gotta win that game. Let's go, guys! - What's the score? - 1 all. Third Period - 4 minutes left - - Holy shit. - What are you waiting for? (loud cheering) (crowd): Maurice! Maurice! Maurice! Maurice! - Nice work. l've been a fan for 30 years. l've owned the team for 12. You scored the greatest goal l ever saw. l'll never forget. (everybody goes silent) - l asked Georges to drive you. - Don't push me away. Maurice... What happened? l've never seen you like that. Ever. They'll drive you crazy. - Maybe. July 1952 - Look, dear, find yourself another chump. - l want things to change. - Alright. What'll we talk about? - Their insults. l, Maurice Richard, as a journalist and veteran of the Canadiens, l want to help with my modest means. Wilson and Howe's insults got to me. Mr Chadwick refuses to help Bouchard and me only because we're French Canadian. - l wanted to tell you that you are the best Canadiens manager of all time. And l just wanted to tell you that it is a good idea to repaint the forum, because it shows you respect the fans. - Well, l do respect the fans. - Can l show you something? - Yeah, sure. So... what d'you wanna show me? - People... don't like this. 1952-53 Season And then there's referee Udvari, who acts like he's on Conn Smythe's payroll. lt undermines the league's credibility. ln Miss Norris and Jack Adams's presence, another referee wants only to impress. l shouldn't have to point this out and l've swallowed too much, put up with too much. If Boston wants to play rough, fine with me. If it means getting hurt, so be it. If l'm pushed, l'll strike the first blow. Spread the word. They call us goddamn Frenchmen! The league tolerates it! - What else? - l'm too riled to go on. - We need 200 more words to finish the column. - Leave it blank. - ''l'm too riled to go on.'' Maurice... - Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Gentlemen. Gentlemen. Well, that was one hell of a ride! And, uh... l just want to take this moment to thank each and every single one of you for your effort and for your courage. Each and every one of you has been an essential part of this greatjourney. Thank you for persevering until we won the Stanley Cup. And now let's drink some champagne. 1953-54 Season - That hothead Murphy smashed Geoffrion on the skull. Murphy bragged he'd bust his face. Geoffrion had no choice. Murphy swung hard. Boom Boom pulled back in time. The stick just grazed him. Two inches more, he'd be dead. - The other reporters have covered that. l wrote a piece on the St. Sauveur gang. - The commissioner handed down his ruling. - You want to attack Campbell? You want to attack the league commissioner? - Yes. - Get me someone who reads French. - Yes, Mr Campbell. - l will not apologize and l will not stop writing in a paper. - Well, then Campbell says you can no longer play in the NHL. - Will the Canadiens stand by me? - You've taken on Campbell in the paper! - Everything in there is true and you know it! Mr lrvin, there are all things you have said yourself. There are all things other governors have said - in the paper and on the radio. Conn Smythe has said the same thing, Jack Adams! - lt's all true, but it's not up to you. - Things have to change! Things have to change! - We're all trying to change things. - l will not apologize. Why can Maurice Richard give his opinion?! - You do as you want, Maurice. But l'll tell you one thing: lf you choose not to retract, it'll be the worst decision you've ever made. Because you're a great hockey player, the best l've ever seen. But if you're no longer in the NHL, in a year's time, no one will give a shit what you think. Or what you write. You're a hockey player, play hockey. - Maurice... l've written the letter for you. lf you don't sign it, don't bother coming to Chicago. - Here. On the house. One year later... - As a general rule, after 12 years, players' careers are over, leaving thousands of fans in mourning. But at 34, the Rocket's had his best season yet. Despite rookies like Geoffrion, B?liveau and Moore, Maurice has outdone himself. He's the Habs' number-one asset. All Quebec follows his every move. With 4 regular matches left, he's a step away from finally winning the scoring title. Good luck! - There you go, boys. Read what Boston thinks about les Canadiens. l'm gonna give you two, so you really know just how much they hate you down there. Boston Garden, March 13, 1955 - 3rd Period - Okay, guys, let's go! Let's go! Step it up! Let's go. Let's get out there! Come on. Let's go. Change up, boys! (crowd booing) (crowd shouting) - We're here for Mr Richard. - Everything's under control. - We need to talk to Maurice. - This concerns the NHL. - We're not leaving here without Maurice. - Yes, you are. - You went too far, hitting a referee! - l never saw a ref hold someone like that. lt was dangerous. Montreal - Wednesday, March 16, 1955 - - Mr Richard, what did Campbell have to say? - Gentlemen. - Maurice? - So what do you think? - lt's gonna be a hell of a fine, but l don't think he'll be missing any games. - l think he's gonna be missing at least one of the last three games. - No, he can't do that. Campbell knows Maurice is leading the league in scoring. - l hope you're right. Let's get that head fixed up. - Lucille? - Everyone's calling. What do l say? - Campbell said he'd rule quickly. lf they fine me, it's over. - What do you mean? - l'll stop playing. l can't take it. lt'll never change. We can't win against them. - lt'll be OK. - l have a bad feeling. Selke wasn't there to meet Campbell. No one's seen him since New York. No... l'm sure it's over. - l'll be here. - l know. - Where are they? - Downstairs. - What happened? - You're out for the entire season... and all the play-offs. - What did Laycoe get for hitting me first? - Nothing. - ... smashing cars and store windows downtown. Fans violently protested Campbell's ruling. The conflict has taken on a racial dimension. Campbell's presence was the ultimate provocation. lnside the arena Campbell was attacked. (phone and doorbell) A homemade tear-gas bomb went off. Montreal is in an uproar. - What the hell are you talking about, quitting? You can't quit. You're the Babe Ruth of hockey. So they got a little crazy out there, they broke a few windows. l wanted to tell you that, uh... l always felt l needed to win. And l know that you needed to win just as bad. And that's why l pulled all the crazy stuff and... l pushed you really hard. And l just wanna say that, uh... l hope there are no hard feelings. Because you are the... greatest hockey player there will ever be. - Montr?al est sens dessus dessous. Got something to say? Give us a call. What do you think about Campbell blaming everyone else for damage totalling hundreds of thousands dollars? He blames Richard. And lrvin, for not controlling Richard. The mayor, for not controlling us. l bet he blames reporters, too. Right, Mr Campbell? We'll take your calls. Selke wants Maurice to speak to the fans, but don't bet on it. Our sources say Maurice won't show. The Rocket's decided it's the end of his career. He's had it. What about the newspapers saying we should be ashamed? Let's hear from you. Honest citizens - not bums - say there'll be more. lt will make the riot look like a picnic. The entire city is seething. l have a question: Where is Richard? Give us a call. - Maurice... l'm just a barber. l don't know much. Can l say something? You lost your right to talk and play hockey... but not your right to fight. - Why fight if you know you'll lose? - We haven't fought in so long, we've forgotten how to win. Let me tell you... it was good to see people react. Last night made no sense, but still... it was necessary. - lt's just hockey. - l know it's just hockey. Since we never win out there, it's important for a French Canadian to win, even if only in sports. We have to practise winning. lf you quit now, they'll have won. Don't quit. lf you're tired, you can retire next year. But not now. All eyes are on you. - For a ''little barber'' who doesn't know much... you're not bad. My dear friends... l've always played passionately. l had problems in Boston. And was suspended. l'm sad not to be joining my teammates in the play-offs. l must think about Montreal fans, and the Canadiens players, who are my best friends. l ask fans not to cause any more trouble, and to stand behind the Canadiens, so they beat the Rangers and Detroit this weekend. We can still win the Cup. l accept my punishment. And... And l'll be back next season to help my team, and its younger players, to win the Stanley Cup. Maurice Richard played for five more years, during which the Canadiens won five consecutive Stanley Cups. Maurice Richard... He's all of Quebec standing up, powerful and alive.
