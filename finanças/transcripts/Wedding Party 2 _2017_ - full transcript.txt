Welcome to Oceania. - Thank you. - Thanks. I've always wanted to come here. Thank you for giving me a reason. Wow. Thank you. A nurse shark. Oh. So, what reason did I give you? I missed your birthday. You got me a Swarovski purse, silly. That was a gift, I wasn't there. I'm just gonna go to the bathroom. Oh. Okay? I'll be right back, don't move. Hi, you, wait, why are you calling me, aren't you supposed to be on your romantic getaway with Nonso? Ha, hold on. Okay. Honestly, what the hell is going on here? No, is this what I paid you for? Look at them, do they look like a couple you want the to be, no, why, because they look homeless. Fix it. Hi, Diedre, my love, oh, is Nonso boring you that much that you have time to call me? He's brought me to the Oceania. He brought you to Oceania? Oceania's a nice restaurant. So has he proposed yet? No. Not yet, but I think he's going to. Wow, I didn't think Nonso was that stupid, it's only been, - like, what, six months? - I know. Look, what if he just likes the restaurant? He's never been here before. That's a proposal, honey. Okay, what, maybe it is, maybe it isn't. I don't know, I don't, I don't know, I mean... But Dee, if it is, what will you do? What a fake guy, how do you propose in a place like this? So obvious. Oops. That's why you don't propose in public. Thanks, girls, I gotta go. Okay, bye. Yes. Yes, Nonso, I will marry you. Yes. Is that one yours? Yeah. It's good for you. Is the captain not here yet? No, he's on his way. How are you, I hope he won't be late. Isn't it the top of the small one we wanted? It is, I've asked them to order it for us. Yes, once oil price money goes up $200.00, we are buying it. Well, we are most certainly looking forward to that, and shall we board, as we wait for our children? Yes, yes. Please. Oh, I forgot something. What is it, Tinuade? Champagne. Oh, no, no, that's not necessary, there's champagne on the yacht. I know, this one is special, it's from France. Harrison! Harrison! Sorry, Ma. Don't do that, though. Go into the car, and bring me the carton of champagne. Yes, Ma. Wine. Ah-ah, rum. Chilled one or a cold one? Oh, lord, hot one. Okay. He's going to bring it. But a royal palm plantation takes, like, 80 years to produce. Yeah, but he has a technology that does it in two years, max, two years. Oh, so why don't you sell it to the plantations? He wants us to give it some time for the. With your money? Oh, I thought we were going to run this together. Hey, down here, what is that! Easy, easy, easy. Oh, thank you, my darling. Thank you. Oh, stay where you are, don't move. Why are you so much in a hurry, we are going too fast. Mom, I'm fine, I'm pregnant, not sick. I know you are fine, do you want to fall inside this water, eh? It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. Easy does it, gentle, yeah, yeah. Bam-Bam, oh, , where's your dad, easy, oh. Hold her, hold her, no, no, no, hold her, hold her. Hello, my lovely, shall I help you with that? Yes, please. Careful, now. That's how to do it. You are absolutely glowing, my son is doing... Thanks, Mama. You're welcome, hello, darling. Hi, Daddy. How are you? Very well. What is the matter with you? I've done nothing to you. Mom, I'm fine. I know you are fine, but do you want to have back pain? What? Yes, if you do, it's CS, do you want CS? CS... - Really, a CS? - No, we don't want CS. - Mommy, we don't want CS. - Yes. We don't want CS. Harrison, Harrison! Mummy? Go inside the car and bring me Dunni's special pillow. Special pillow? Dunni, yes. We don't want CS, baby, we don't. - Stop it, don't. - Dunni, it's okay, it's okay. Pillows, yeah, I got you 20 more. Sir, Oga, please, help us to dress. Help you to do what? Sorry, sorry, man, just move for him. Sorry, I put, like this. Sorry, sorry. Sorry, sir. Sorry. This is not even comfortable. - It is comfortable. - Oh, my. Come on, come on. Nonso, darling, you said that you had an announcement you wanted to make? Yeah, I do. Okay, go on. This might come as a bit of a surprise. - You think? - Yeah. Sorry. Sorry. I'm. I'm. I'm getting married. Let's go! Hallelujah! Eh, come here, hold my hand. Congratulations! Well done, well done. Tinuade? Uju? Felix? Married? To who? Diedre? Viagra. Not Viagra, Diedre. Okay, sorry. I mean, isn't this a bit too sudden? I mean, you've been dating her for what, now, like, eight months? Six. You went to Dubai for a business meeting, not so? How in the world did you get to propose? Oh, you will be happy, you are blessed. Give god the glory, what do you want? You're only a. Well, let me tell you, I. I will be the one to supply from my shop. Do you understand? And you're going to have the best deals in Lagos, your wedding's in Lagos, abi? We are yet to decide. Decide, Diedre's going to marry into the family. And we are family. Ah, it is simple, Felix? She's telling her parents tonight, so I'll find out later. Well done, well done. - A toast, maybe. - Yeah. To the bride and groom. Everybody, bride and groom, to the... You're getting married, to Edward? Edward, no, we broke up four years ago. But he's 120th in line to the throne. He cheated on me. Ah, well, forgiveness is a virtue. I'm not marrying Edward, Dad. Well, then, who are you marrying, darling? His name is Nonso Onwuka. Oh, is he Japanese? No, he's Nigerian. Oh. Nigerian? Why would you marry a Nigerian? Because I love him. But you're in the line of succession, love is not a reason. I'm 3,264th in line to the throne, who cares? 3,255th, darling, the Earl of Cumberland had a daughter. I thought you'd be happy for me. If not for the ban against Sophia's Catholic descendants, your at-great-great-great-grandfather would have been the king. You missed a great, and anyway, it's only our family that thinks Victoria would have married him, and not Albert. Well, that's true. And even if it is, Dad, so what? But , but you're in the line of succession. You would need the Queen's permission to marry. I doubt that she would approve of you marrying a Nigerian nobody. That law was repealed in 2013. Well, I don't approve, what is it with you and Nigerians? What do you mean? Well, your university friends were Nigerian, and now you want to marry one. We should have sent her to Cambridge like a proper Winston. Nigerians go to Cambridge, too, Dad, would you rather me marry one of them? Now you're mocking me. Only a little. Come on, you know you're going to agree, so why draw it out? But you're heir to a grand tradition. Marrying Nonso's not going to change that. I love our traditions, and that's never going to change, no matter whom I marry. You really love him? Yes, I do. Oh, well, then I suppose I'm going to have to agree, don't I? Only if you agree to give me away at the wedding. Well, we better call the archbishop and preserve Christchurch. Oh, no, but... Oh, no buts, Winstons married there for centuries. Fine, you can have the cathedral, if you agree to follow the traditional Nigerian engagement. Oh. You're going to love Nigeria, it's a beautiful place. Next? Ah, hello. Hi, how are you? I am good, thank you. Sir, are you sure you're in the right place? I'm exactly in the right place, yes. Not Kenya? No, no, no, no, no, no. She doesn't look sure, though. No. You're sure you're supposed to be here? Yes. So why are you visiting Nigeria today? I'm on holiday. Holi-what? Holiday. Who goes to Lagos on holiday? These people. I'm getting married. You are getting married? Yes. Oh, my, wow, look at you, fine girl. Oh, gosh, is he Igbo or Yoruba? Igbo. He's Igbo, yeah, I knew, my sister, huh? Oh, Mama, try, oh, welcome, my sister, welcome. Don't worry, oh, Igbo man, yeah, okay, he'll buy you. Hey, look at you, beautiful thing like yourself, hey, , oh, wow. Stop this thing, well, my friend. Sorry, oh, child, fine girl, I like your hair, oh, wow, it looks nice. Happy weekend, sir. Thank you, you have a happy weekend, too. You, too, have a great weekend, sir. Happy, happy weekend. Happy weekend, sir. And thank, thank you, thank, thank, thank, thank you, bye-bye. Okay, bye-bye! Bye-bye. Next! Hey. Come on. What's your dad wearing? Don't ask. Hi, Ma. Mummy, Dad, this is Nonso. Welcome to Lagos, Ma. Oh. Sir, welcome to Lagos. Hello. We have a car waiting outside. Oh, it shouldn't be a problem, we only have a few pieces of luggage. Oh. Eh, hey, huh? I'm sorry, no. Hello? Yes, we're. It's nothing, just. It's for personal use. Are you going to be the one to tell me what is for personal use, huh, you want to explain my job? That is how they smuggle things into this country. Are not personal effects. Hello, someone wants to speak with you. I'll not talk to anybody, I not take phone, I have your time, all the time in the world. This administration is here for a reason. We are fighting corruption. His badge says T. Achebong. Yes, perfect. We don't take bribes, if you give us something, we can it, but we don't take bribe. Hello, who is this? Sir! Yes, sir! Sorry, sir, they are right here, they are waiting, sir, yes, sir, yes, sir, they are on their way, sir, yes, sir. They are going already, sir, they are going, sir, yes, sir. They are going, sir. Sir. You are welcome, have a happy weekend. Yes, and you have a happy weekend, too, my good man, thank you. Where are we? We're at my parents. Oh, we would have preferred to have stopped at our hotel to have freshened up. Sorry, getting them here was hard enough. There seems to have been some miscommunication, we made arrangements for you to stay at my parent's. However, we could get you a hotel if you'd prefer. Oh, we'd be delighted to stay with your parents. Dunni? Mummy? I had the American make a special pepper soup just - for you. - Thanks, Mom. So enjoy it. Can I try some, or was it just for pregnant women? What? The soup. It's hot! Well... Pa, it's very spicy. Well, I manage very well with the lamb, I'm sure it can't as bad as that. A bowl, my good. Are you sure? If the man wants the bowl, give him a bowl. It's a bad idea. Why not, a bowl. Bring the pepper soup. Mom, Mom. Are you sure this is a good idea? It is. If he says he wants, he wants. Ah, there, a little bit more would be nice, thank you, thank you, give me one more spoon, one more spoon. - That's fine, there, right. - All right, yes, that's okay, all right, oh, yeah? I'm going to tradition, tradition. No, use a spoon, no! To my new in-laws. To all of you, bottom's up, yes. Oh, yeah. Stop laughing, it's not funny. Water! Oh, sorry, Mom! Daddy. Why did you give it to him? Water, water! Goodness! ♪ Oh, oh ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ In fact, from a very long time ago ♪ ♪ I loved you so ♪ ♪ I thought it was plain to see ♪ ♪ That you were the one for me ♪ Why did you bring him? Sola, okay, that's enough, it's enough. I'm sorry, now. It's just such an awesome thing, bro, I mean, who else gets engaged accidentally? Accidental. This was a mistake. Nonso, wait, wait, Sola. Well, he's right, only a fool proposes by accident. Okay, bro, but do you love her? I, I think so, I don't know, we've only been together for, what, seven months now? That's bad, right, I should cancel the wedding. No, how can I do that when we've already come this far? Oh my goodness. Do you want to tell her, maybe? Tell her what, oh, I'm sorry, I proposed to you by accident, let's just cancel the wedding, but stay together? Shit, oh, shit. So what are you going to do? ♪ My friends, they told me I should tell you so ♪ I'll get married, I guess. Okay. Take care. See you tomorrow, bro. All right. ♪ So I have to let you hold it now, I told you that ♪ Look, look, look, look, look, see what's happening. What's that? What was that? See, I don't take you out because of this nonsense. I thought you might be asleep. Dee, I'm pregnant, not five. I'm sorry. What's up? Nothing. You don't want to get married? I didn't, I didn't say that. But you're not saying anything. Dee, why did you say yes? Because I love him. Dunni, let me take. Oh, I'm sorry, I can come back, it's fine. No, no, it's okay. Dee. Are you sure, I can... What's wrong, why is everything so weird? Cold feet, she just has cold feet, she'll be fine by the morning, I hope. Huh? Hmm? What's wrong? - Nothing, it's fine. - Uh-uh, baby. - Mm-mm, it's okay. - Baby. Don't worry now. No secrets, remember? He proposed by accident? Shh, what's wrong, why are you shouting? Do you want Diedre to hear you? How could you let this happen? Hey, look, is it me that proposed to her? Please, oh. Baby, we have to tell her. Well, she said yes, which means she actually wants to get married to him. Yeah, but he doesn't want to marry her. No, I mean, okay, maybe he wasn't ready to propose right away, but he loves her, though, he loves her, I know that. Mm-mm, baby, what if something goes wrong? We just have to make sure nothing goes wrong, it's fine, don't worry about it, okay? Look what I got you. Hey, yeah, shift, shift, shift, shift, shift for me. Shift for me, now, ah. I know what you're doing. Eat some sugar, please. You know you want it. I don't want sugar, we're talking about something... Take it, eat some sugar. Good morning, Mrs. Onwuka. Yes, that's right, we are already setting up at the Lily Gate Hotel, yes, everything is going... Now, are the flowers arranged exactly how I want them to be? Yeah? Let me call you back. Yoruba outfit? Yes, I know, don't they look wonderful? Yes. You both look very nice. - Absolutely. - Thank you. We're gathering in the living room. Okay. I've asked Harrison to be the spokesman, and Harrison's , abi, abi? It's fine. Okay, let's go, guys, let's go. So not only are you content to marry our second son. You are marrying. And a good morning to you, too, Auntie Adana. What is so good about this morning, eh? Sister. What is good about this morning? Sister. Thank god that our father is not alive to see today, to see what is happening in his family. Sister, it's so good to see you, hmm? I am glad that you have come. I don't, I have no idea. Might I? Don't touch my brother's wife. The gifts are on the way. They're bringing gifts, small, small, they're bringing gifts, come. We wait. We wait. Eh? I'm sorry, ma'am. You're sorry? Yes, ma'am. Ma, the driver called, said that the vehicle broke down on the express, ma'am. And so? Ma'am, there's problem, oh. Now, you gets problem, they won't meet... No, Ma, that is it, they are carrying the gifts, all the gifts, ma'am. As in the gifts that were supposed to be here yesterday? That's what I was trying to say, ma'am, the vehicle broke down. You want to finish my destiny? No, no. You want to scatter this thing from me, abi? Driver said the moto broke down on the express. They warned me about you. I am not the driver, ma'am. Dad, what's going on? Nothing, son, just that Harrison here is the spokesman for the Winstons. What, why? It's okay, it's okay, son, just play it, play along, and just flow along with it. Just go, flow, go with the flow. Yes, I'm the one that wants to... Felix? Felix, I have just about had enough - of this nincom... - There's the list, you must apply this list to marry this girl. You want naira bride price? Bam. One deep freezer, two cartons of champagne, one fridge, 50 chickens, three cases of stout? Five cases of malt, 100 yards of fabric, imported Ghana. You must be mad to think I'd bargain for my daughter like a pound of ham. Oh, come on, now, this is not a bargain, it's a, it's tradition. Well, a pox on your tradition, I will not demean my daughter. Dad, what's going on? Well, they, they, they're trying to buy you. He's mad about the bride price. Oh, Dad, they're not trying to buy me, they're trying to show me that they value me, and want me as part of their family. Oh! It's symbolic. Are you, are you sure? Yes. Oh, well. Well, well, in that case, I think a pound coin would suffice. Brilliant, so let's break Kola. - Kola? - Yes. Okay, I... No, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, no, no? Yes. One ditty, one ditty? Bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter! Water, water! Bitter! Oh, darling, you look lovely. Thank you, Mummy, is it time? Come on, girl. You look beautiful, my dear. Thank you, Daddy. Okay, so Geofery, you are going to ask her, exactly the way we talked about it. Ah, yes, of course. And then she has to look at him before. Right, right, I have it, I have it, I have it, right. My daughter, they say you have brought a man you want to marry. Yes. Well, find him and bring him to me, there you go. Go along. Sit down. Everything that you seek and you need in your marriage, it will be handed on to you, in Jesus' name. Amen. A toast for the youngest Onwuka family. May you have the very best in life, cheers. But I saw it on the internet. Is not internet. You caused this, you forget? You brought this foolish woman to come and marry our. Hey, why are you like this, eh? It was an honest mistake, eh, don't be angry, now. Enough, okay, enough, okay, enough. Our father will roll in his grave to see what you have made of our family. Made of your family? Your family is beneath my daughter. Our ancestors crossed over with William the Conqueror, and one of them even fought with Henry the IV at Hastings, and we are direct descendants of Sophia of Hanover. And if it were not for the Catholic bar, my great-great-great-grandfather would have been the king of England. My grandfather saved Mountbatten, and Nehru in India during partition, not worthy of you? No, sir, you are not worthy of us. Your entire country is not worthy. Hey! Nonso, you will not marry that woman, you will not! As long as I live, you will not marry her. I forbid you. You forbid? Yes, I forbid! There you go again, you couldn't then, and you can't now, who exactly are you to forbid anything? It will not happen, as long as I live, it will not! And what is that, exactly, let's see, three years, she can wait. Obianuju. Did you hear her? That's enough. Her witches want me to die in three days, in three years, you are the one that should die. If anybody is likely to die, it should be, it will be you, you are likely to burst a vein, you're likely to have an aneurism if you do not stop, no, you are likely to die. Adana, you are likely to drop dead. Enough! I will not let this person jeopardize my son's happiness over a tantrum. Tantrum, what's a tantrum, what's a tantrum? Did you not hear him, or are you deaf, too? Well, the last time I checked, my son wasn't marrying Diedre's father. Obianuju, that's enough. Adana... We marry families, now. Adana! We marry families! This wedding will not be shelved. Yes! Yes. This wedding will go on. Why would you say such hurtful things? I was, I was defending you. Defending me? Yes. How? Well... By insulting my new family and friends? She's right. Well, they think you're not worthy. Who's they? Them. Despite the insult, we have decided to go on with the wedding, you will now see the dignity and honor in marrying a Nigerian because I am proud to be a Nigerian. I love you. Thank you. Oh, dear. May I have a word with you? Yes. You know, watching our parents almost kill each other kind of makes me want to marry you more, is that weird? Well, I feel the same way, so if it's weird, then you're in good company. I wonder how we're going to survive them through the engagement. I have an idea. Come on. Come. Hello. Hi, Dad. Hi. We want to have the wedding next month in Dubai. Dubai? Why Dubai? I thought we agreed on Christ Cathedral. It takes a year to get a booking at Christ Cathedral, it's not an option, and let's not pretend you'd have the wedding here. Well, well, why are you in such a hurry? You started a fight at our introduction, we think it's best to have a small, quick wedding. It's either that, or we go to the registry, no party, no nothing. No, no, no, no, no. Nonso, a month isn't enough to organize a wedding. Plus, if it's any later, Dunni can't travel, and I want her to be my maid of honor. Yes, I need to be there. Well, if you use Victoria as your maid of honor, then, well, both sides will be represented. We have family in Nigeria, oh? And they must have fun, enjoyments galore, and are waiting, it's as simple as that. Whatever plans we have, we, as a family, must come together and make sure that we show the, the Winstons, or. The Winstons that we are better than them, that the whole country's better than them, we are behind you, just take all of us to Dubai. The very best people. This is your department, darling. Try again. Well, it's, it's... Agreed on the venue. It's just two weeks until the wedding. Let's not blame me, let's blame those. Well, don't worry, from now on, you won't have to deal with them again. We'll plan the wedding without your input. Fine. We'll end up with two weddings in the same venue. That sounds settled to me. Aw! It's the Onwukas. Oh, wow, look at you. You look so, anyway, congratulations. Thank you, are you going to Dubai? Of course. Mm, do you want to follow her? Uh-uh, Dunni. Stop it, follow who, to where, when I'm here with you? I saw you looking at her. I'm looking at you, my eyes belong to you, hello, stop it. Whatever. We're going to Dubai, baby, it's going to be a good time. Are you happy to see Rosie? I'm happy to see you, who is that, I don't even know who she is. Let me see. This thing is not valid, take. Do you know who I am? Who are you? I am. No, no, this is not a valid visa, now. - What do you mean? - I mean... Yeah, come on and pass now. I won't let you come back in. How are you today, sir, welcome to Atlantis. Let me escort you to your suite, yeah? It's turn up time, boy. Hey, Sola is the master. I'm busy, guys. Busy doing what? Planning his escape from his fake marriage. If you must know, I am writing my speech. His speech, guy, forget. What's this I'm hearing about Club 360, and your bachelor party? That's where I want to go. Fam, please, let me do this for you. Okay? I, sorry, go ahead. I'll give you a bachelor party to remember, bro. The last time you tried arranging one, you almost ruined a marriage, no, thanks. Just chill, chill, chill, chill, Nonso, wait. Let's try to take it easy on Sola, let's not, let's not project your worries on him. My worries, I'm fine, I have no worries. Wait, wait, wait, you're actually fine? You're actually okay with it, since when, please. Well, since I figured she was the best thing that's happened to me, and I'm the luckiest man because she said yes. Aw, you didn't even say thank you to me. Huh, for what? Did you not meet at my wedding? Congrats, bro, much love. He's got a point. Do you even know what kind of ring you want? Know what kind of ring he wants. Look, look at them. I am looking. Good afternoon. Hello. Welcome to Versace. Thank you. Dunni, look at this one! Hey, hey, hey, look, look, look! I am looking. Look at this! Wow. This is one of our rings from the special collection, it's the Greek collection. Here you go. Bro, if you no pick one here now, eh, I no say you no are married. Definitely. I got your message about the beach availability you said. I know. Just move it, move it, I will cover any obstructions, do you understand? But the wedding is tomorrow, Ma, it's just not going to be possible. Wonu, you've started again, Wonu. Just do it! Move it, and listen to me, don't say anything to Obianuju, I will do it myself, I will tell her myself, it's a surprise, okay, get off the phone! Harrison! Is that how you used to be? So I cannot play with you? Yes, they've changed the venue, we're now Atlantis beach. It's your wedding, if you wanted the Atlantis beach, why didn't you just insist? Nonso and I decided to leave everything to the planners. You know that's actually crazy, right? Oh, look at you, "Nonso and I this, "Nonso and I that," you guys are sweet. Oh, please, don't encourage her. What, she was afraid to get married a month ago, now look at her! I need to pee. All these pregnant people. Stop it! Well, it's true, you are glowing, what changed? I was scared, but I really love him, and I can't wait to be married. Ugh. You can knock if you want. And I will. But it is sweet, though, that you finally found your Nigerian prince who comes and just sweeps you off your feet, but I would deny you in public. Fair enough. Fair enough. That's between you and I. You see why she... Shh. Dunni, are you enjoying your pepper soup? Yes, Mummy, thank you. You see, Wonu and Yamake had to travel all over Dubai to get the ingredients. Aw, please tell them thank you, thanks, Mama. How did she get the pepper soup in here? She threatened the manager. Yeah. - It doesn't, I mean... - It doesn't? Sister? You didn't tell me you were coming. Why wouldn't I come? Well, you did say you weren't coming. Oh, shut up. When your friend called me illiterate in Nigeria, what did you say, why didn't you tell her that no Onwuka is an illiterate, we travel around. Sister, come. Please. Oh, my brother, I must attend a Paris wedding. Here they go. Felix, this one, you people are organizing wedding at the beach, have you forgotten that the Onwukas don't hold their weddings at the beach so we don't get entangled with marine spirits? Oh, and there your sister goes again, what are you on about now? This isn't taking place at any beach, this event is slated for the Armani Hotel, not so? Yes, we are, we are... Events have special places for them, this is part of the wedding, it doesn't have to be here. Sister. Sister, the wedding is not at the beach, it's at the Armani. This is part of the wedding. Who requested for the change in venue without asking me? What is the matter with you? Tell me, what is the matter with you? Me, what? What gave you the right to shift the venue of my son's wedding without asking me? Sister. Obianuju, I can explain. Explain, Tinuade, there's something you want to explain to me, this is none of your business, and this right here is not your family, why do you meddle? Obianuju, please, it's okay. No, Felix, it is not. What consumed her to interfere, what possessed you? I. I was on my way out of the lobby. I heard Diedre and Yemisi and Dunni talking. They didn't see me because I didn't stop. Once I heard that, once I heard that. We book the Atlantic beach for the wedding. Why didn't you tell me? I wanted to tell, but until I was sure, until you confirmed, confirmed it was a go. Look, I was going to tell you when we were at the market, but I forgot. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. Mummy, it's okay. It's okay. I am tired. I need to get to the hotel. Obianuju? Obianuju, please come. You've done well. This is exactly what I'm talking about, this is exactly what I'm talking about, guys, look at this, look, are you feeling me? Man, you guys, man. And what's the problem with that? Nonso, the last time we did something like this with Sola, you know what happened, okay? Let's go to a normal club with normal people, and have normal drinks, and go home. Because I am your senior brother. You are my senior brother, you should know better. You have enough rice and chicken in the house, leave this small chops life, and let's go. This is Lisa. Hi, Lisa. And this is Anita. And this is us leaving, nice to meet you. See you later, let's go, you're gonna thank me for this. - Walk, walk, walk, just walk. - Hey, hey, hey, hey... We're are coming, we are coming. Where are you going? We are coming. Wait, now. We are coming. Small chops. We are here now, lord commander. Yeah, whatever. All I was trying to do was make up for the fact that homeboy over here is getting married accidentally... Sola, shut up. Dude, no, but seriously, now, how do you expect to explain to this woman that you initially really didn't propose, and now you're proposing with a new ring? Sola, shut up! Hi, boys. Rosie. What are you doing here? Well, it's the best party in town. That's what I'm talking about. Guys, I'll catch up with you in a second, okay? Mm, of course, an accidental meeting to go with an accidental wedding, eh? Let me handle it, I got you, I got you, Rosie, wait, Rosie wait. Rosie. Sola was just joking. And you're pulling me aside just to tell me that, hmm? Oh, okay, so it really was a fake wedding. No, it's not like that, it's not like that. Yet you're flirting to buy my silence, eh? Rosie, I'm not flirting with you. Well, you should be, and I mean you really should be. Lucky for you, I'm amenable. - Rosie. - Yes? Nothing will ever happen between us, okay? And yet you can't keep your eyes off me. Rosie, you're a beautiful woman. Aw. And any man would look, but I belong to Dunni, now and always, and you need to accept it. You should tell me that more often. I wasn't spying, honest, I was on my way to the toilet. How much did you hear of that? Enough to make me want to take you home and have my way with you right now. As nice as that sounds, it's going to have to wait, okay? Yeah. I love you, I'll see you in a bit. I love you. I love you more. Is it true? Deedee! Deedee! Deedee. Deedee, I love you. You love me, you love me? If you love me, you would, you would... It was Sola, he... He what, was the one that said you accidentally proposed? How did he, how did he know if you didn't tell him? I. Did you give me this ring? Did you ask me to marry you? No, I did not. Oh my god. Dee! Deedee! Deedee, I love you. I was scared I was going to lose you, I made a mistake. Dee, if you'd have me, I'd love, love to be your husband. You love me, but you didn't trust me enough to tell me you made a mistake. I'm sorry, that's not love. Dee! Dee! Sorry, bro, it's all my fault, man, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. It's not your fault, it's on me. I can't believe you guys told Sola, and you didn't tell me. Okay, you're right, I'm sorry. It's fine, but what are we going to do now? I don't know, I think interfering will only make things worse. How can it be worse than it is now? The wedding has been called off, and how are we okay with that? Maybe we should sleep on it, maybe things will feel better in the morning. - Yeah. - Yeah? Good night, guys. Good night. We won't have a wedding by the morning. You know what, I actually agree, we should do something, something. You're the reason we have to do anything, anyway, it's like you have an anointing for just ruining weddings. Well, I'm the only one still here with you. So are you gonna stay mad at me, or are you actually gonna let me help you? Are you coming? Hmm? Who can that be? What's going on, darling? I don't know, at this hour, no peace. Oh, oh, too low. Oh. He didn't propose? Well, he accidentally proposed. But he loves her. And she loves him. Why would she want to cancel the wedding? Well, she had doubts earlier, and I think the non-proposal may have brought them back? Maybe it's for the best. Thank you for telling us. Thank you. Have a good night. That's what we were hoping for. That's what we were hoping for. Why would we hope for our daughter to be unhappy? What does that mean? Geofery, are you coming? Coming? Where? Oh, bother. At least it was worth a shot. You saw his face. It made his day. Excuse me, do you know the Onwuka's room number? So, as I see it, we can let this wedding fall apart, or we can try to help our children. Ma'am, what if this marriage is not what they really want? We knew this whole thing was a bit too quick, and now we know why, maybe we should just let the whole thing die a natural death. Felix. Geofery! Do you want him? Ugh. Although it galls me to say it, I've never seen her happier than when she thought she was going to get married to your boy. Now, you're not the family I would have chosen for her, but she's found her place with you. Geofery, was there a compliment somewhere in there? I'm not so sure. So, what are we going to do? I have an idea. Here you are. I want to be alone. We need to talk, darling. I think I'd rather be alone, Mum. Darling, we really need to talk. I heard your man was dumb enough not to propose to you. Nan, don't make me laugh, I'm too angry to laugh. Do you love him? It's not that simple. Let me tell you a story. When I was a young woman, during the war, I was not happy driving ambulances around London, I joined the SOE, and went to France to fight the Nazis. This was not a thing done by the Rutherfords, but it wasn't gonna stop me, you are a Winston girl, follow your heart, and let the rest be damned. We're in the restaurant, if you'd like to join us. Well, guys, I, thanks for coming out, I, I guess she's not coming. Deedee. I'm here. What do you want? My daughter, the Onwuka family have come here to ask for your hand in marriage. Dad, what are you doing? Marriage is a joining of families, now, we have researched their family, and found them to be fit, however, we love you, and will not make you marry against your will. Their representative will now speak on their behalf. My sister. Deedee, you deserve the kind of proposal that would make angels sit up and watch. And I'm sorry you have to make do with this. I love you, Deedee, please do me the honor of becoming my wife. And if I said no and walked away? I'd live the rest of my life in regret. I'm sorry, I can't. I'll tell everyone tomorrow that we're calling off the wedding, we'll return the gifts. Deedee. No. Yemisi. I'm not having this, why are you so determined to be unhappy? This is not the place. This is the place, this is the family that loves you, the one you were born in, and the one you chose. Everybody here cares about you. And we all want the best for you, please, don't do this. You love him. Marry him. You know you want to. Ask me again. Deedee. Make me the happiest man in the world by saying yes to becoming my wife. Yes. Wait a minute, this isn't my ring. I bought you a new ring, I thought you deserved one I bought myself. You can save that for the wedding, yes. A toast! To the latest Mr. and Mrs. Nonso Onwuka, cheers. Okay, okay, guys, is everyone happy now? Yeah, please, can we go to bed? I am tired. You should go on, darling. Good night, guys. - Good night. - Good night. Can we talk? Tinuade. Tin-Tin, my darling. I would like to apologize for earlier. We are family, and I know that you would only act in our best interest. You don't have to apologize, I should be the one doing the apology. It was not in my place to make conditions, which I did. You are the mother of the groom. I'm so sorry. Very, very sorry. We're gonna be just fine. I'm just glad this is all over. Come on, we have a wedding to go to. Okay. Sorry. We make a good team, don't we? What, what did I say, what did I say? Bro, relax, okay, she'll be here. You don't think maybe she changed her mind? Changed her, no, she didn't change her mind, she's coming, calm down. Patience. Do you think she did the right thing? What do you mean? Realize she's not good enough for Nonso, and just, and just leave the man and go? Ah. Diedre is a great addition to this family, and if you don't like it, please, keep it to yourself, eh? I'm not here to fight, though, I'm not to fight. Where have you all been? I wanted her to make a grand entrance. Doesn't she look lovely? Oh. You look like a princess. It's such a shame she's only 3,264th in line to the throne. 3,265th. 3,265th, darling. Come on, let's go, before we're late, - off we go. - All right. Come on, Nan. You are stunning, absolutely, darling. Thanks, Nan. There we go. Come on, we're already late. I hope you're ready, 'cause they're on their way now. Get off me! What is going on? Easy, easy, stop, what is the fight for? They brought me all the way from Nigeria. Listen, I demand to get this brute taken off of the venue, he's just assaulted me. Me, brute, me, brute, do you know who I am? Do I know who you are? I know who I am, I don't care if you don't know, listen, my grandfathered MC'd a royal wedding, what was yours doing, swinging from the trees? Oh, that is why I need to swing those royal punches on you right now. Oh, yeah, buddy, you wouldn't dare, he wouldn't dare. Forget all this. This is ridiculous, I'm sorry about... Do you know who I am, eh, eh? You think all this your parents, your great-grandparents,. Get off of me, get off of me! Me, get off of you, apologize, apologize. I'm sorry. Apologize. I'm sorry. Say it out loud, say it out loud. I'm sorry! Sorry guys, we're just getting to know each other, just getting to know each other, right, yeah, we know. I can't believe Rosie and Sola almost ruined another wedding. Mm, well, he did help me talk to the ministers. Yeah, Sola's always willing to fix his messes up. Uh-uh, he's not that bad. 'Cause if you think about it, he, what, what? - You like him. - Ugh. What, no. Yeah, this, your pregnancy is getting to you. Anyway, what, are you okay, is it your water? I think my water just broke. Driver! How are we so late? Well, it's good for a man to get used to waiting for his wife. - Come on. - God. That's Dunni's car, why is it stopping? Everybody, Dunni's water just broke. No, but she's one month early. - I know, I know... - Where is she? She's just a few minutes away, they say there's a clinic nearby. She can go to Dubai Medical Hospital. We can take my chopper, it's that side. Dunni, Dunni, oh, Dunni, Bam-Bam, where are you? Where's my daughter, where's Dunni? Where's my daughter? Leave me alone, let me go! No, they told us to. Push, push. Push, baby, push. Yes, you can do it. - Push. - I can't do it. Yes, you can do it, you can do it, push. Push. Dunni! It's her mom, it's her mom, it's her mom, it's okay. I can see, okay, we're almost done, I can see the head. I can see the head. One more time. You can do it. Look at me, I want a granddaughter, you can do it. Come on, come on. Thank you, thank you, thank you! Guys, it's a girl. And a boy. He is so handsome, he looks just like you. Wait, why are you here? Aren't you supposed to be getting married? We had to see if you were okay. Mom, aren't you supposed to be getting married? We had to see if you were okay. I'm okay, now, you need to go get married. Go, get married, go get married, bye. Bye. Thanks, Mama, Mama, thank you, Ma. Okay, you know they can't get married alone, right? Guys, you need to go to the wedding. You need to go to the wedding now. Now, you look after them for me, all right? Bamidele, let's go, let's go, let's leave the women alone. I am so proud of you, darling. Thank you. Congratulations, darling, look after yourself. Mama, aren't you gonna go? I'm going nowhere. Harrison, get this thing off. Hi, baby. Hi, sugar. Is everybody having a good time, by the way, yeah? Let me hear you say, "Uh-huh, uh-huh." Uh-huh, uh-huh. All right, ladies and gentlemen, the bride and groom. Hello, I see you're having a good time. Well, we were until you came and disturbed us. Well, if you will permit me, my beautiful bride here and I would like to get this wedding rolling. Ladies and gentlemen, should we let them get married? Let's do this, let's do this. Ladies and gentlemen, family and friends, we're gathered here to witness the union of this man and this woman. Nonso Onwuka, do you take Diedre Winston as beloved wife? Yes, I do. Diedre Winston, do you take Nonso Onwuka as beloved husband? Yes, I do. By the power invested in me, I pronounce you husband and wife, now, you may kiss the bride. My brother, I beg, I want to buy a. No, no, no, no. You not sound excited. Tell him now. The pepper is, you know, very, very small, like this small, do you have it? Maybe I should call my cousins, they have a person here in Dubai,. We have traveled far and wide today to bring a special man for you, if he touches you, 10 billion, 20 billion, 30 billion, you got it for 30,. I say, do not let your consuming fire consume us because we should have done better. Everyone know that the sound of my voice, that is supposed to pay their tax, but they have not. God, give them last chance, just five minutes, just five minutes, before you release your fire, lord.
