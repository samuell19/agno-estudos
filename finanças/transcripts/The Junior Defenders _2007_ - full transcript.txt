(cheering) - There have been few programs in the history of American television which have that spark, the kind of following that this show received every single week. - There's no other show that's ever been like it ever since then. Never since the Junior Defenders, every single week it was back to back slammed episode. It was unbelievably brilliant. - The show was huge. I mean I would take time out to watch it when I was a kid and it inspired me in many ways. To Junior Defenders. - And two programs since have been able to duplicate its level of success. (upbeat rock music) (crowd cheering) - The dedication of the Junior Defender fans was really, it was really beyond belief. These guys weren't just fans, they were groupies. I mean everybody just gathered together, dropped everything right after the Donny & Marie Show, Wednesday nights, jump on the TV and watch it. I mean you know, like We Were the Monkees were to the '60s, Junior Defenders were to the '70s. (upbeat rock music) (crowd cheering) - The Junior Defenders was definitely a ground breaking show. I mean it inspired all kinds of merchandise. And you know I have four kids, they were small in the '70s and I had to buy costumes for them at Halloween. I just think that Junior Defenders really, really, had such an impact and really changed the way kids watched television. (upbeat rock music) (crowd cheering) (crowd cheering) - I think it's safe to say that the Junior Defenders show left a permanent mark on the landscape of American popular culture. ♪ Defending freedom, defending justice ♪ ♪ Defending the people, defending the nation ♪ ♪ Rain or shine, through day and night ♪ ♪ Defenders, defenders, defenders ♪ ♪ Junior Defenders ♪ - My favorite Junior Defender character was Future Boy. I mean this kid was a born leader. He was always one step ahead of the crowd, one step ahead of the bad guys. I mean in many, many ways, Future Boy was the quintessential American hero. ♪ Junior Defenders ♪ - [Group] Brain Child. - Brain Child, he was definitely, definitely, the coolest Junior Defender character. This guy was unbelievable, I mean hands down. He was also kind of a smart ass too. I mean that's probably why I liked him in the first place. I mean the Future Boy, he would always go around and beat the shit out of other guys, but Brain Child would just sit there and watch Future Boy get his fucking ass kicked. And that was fantastic you know. He was like fuck it, you know what I mean, I'm not gonna get my ass kicked. ♪ Junior Defenders ♪ - [Group] Psychic Girl. - I always loved Psychic Girl. You know I thought she was really the most courageous of all the Junior Defenders. She was the only girl in the group, she never let that stop her. She always gave 100%. - The Psychic Girl was the Junior Defenders to me. And you know Junior Defenders, they're all great, but Psychic Girl really led the pack. She taught me a lot about women, you know, and feminism and a positive role model for me, and mean I wasn't a girl, I mean I'm still not, but she made me want to be a better woman. - And I think Psychic Girl was definitely a tremendous role model because she wasn't afraid to stand out in a crowd. ♪ Junior Defenders ♪ - [Group] Radar Kid. (electronic music) - You know Radar Kid was definitely my favorite Junior Defender, he was so cool. It's like, he's just a work a day kid, you know I really loved that about him most of all because it's like you really got the feeling he didn't want to be a super hero. All he wanted to do was to go get his job. It's like really appealing that way, you know, like super hero wasn't a big thing about him. That's what I really liked about him. - Radar Kid was the only character I didn't really like. It really struck me the wrong way. And I don't know if I was jealous 'cause Radar Kid got to hang out with Psychic Girl a lot, it might have been that. But he always occurred to me as some little wuss. ♪ Rain or shine, through day and night ♪ ♪ We're junior, we're junior ♪ ♪ We're Junior Defenders ♪ - Hi, I'm John Waters. The Junior Defenders was a landmark television program. From the moment of its premiere in the late 1970s, the show would forever change the face of American primetime television. (musical whooshing) While the initial reviews of the show were mixed, producer George Berryman wasn't concerned. The seasoned Hollywood Veteran was sure that his new show would soon capture the imagination of the American public. And as it turned out, he was absolutely right. By it sixth month, the Junior Defenders had attracted a loyal following. And by its second season, the series was consistently ranking in the top 10 of the Nielsen ratings. ♪ Defending freedom, defending justice ♪ ♪ Defending the people, defending the nation ♪ ♪ Through rain or shine, through day or night, defenders ♪ - Happy 150th episode Junior Defenders! (audience clapping and cheering) - [John] By the end of its third year, the Junior Defenders had firmly established itself as the most popular series for American viewers under 30. But perhaps more importantly, the show had succeeded at bringing old fashioned heroes back into style and a nation still recovering from Watergate and Vietnam. It wasn't long before the show was syndicated in over 150 countries around the world, with devoted fans everywhere from Australia to Saudi Arabia. (upbeat Middle Eastern music) The show was at the height of its success. With no real competition from the other networks, the Junior Defenders had a virtual lock on its time slot. It was a situation that wouldn't last long. - [Group] That's insanity! (audience clapping) - Good evening and welcome to this week's edition of That's Insanity. Our first daredevils tonight, is a man from Centralia, Illinois by the name of Herman McDonald. Mr. McDonald is going to be performing a feat which has never been captured on television before. He intends to take a loaded gun, hold it directly to his head and pull the trigger. Ladies and gentlemen, please do not try this at home. Herman, we're ready when you are. (drums rolling) (gun firing) (gun thudding) (upbeat music) (audience cheering) Wow, ladies and gentlemen, what'd ya think of that? - [Audience] That insanity! - [John] The Junior Defenders had finally met its match. That's Insanity become an instant hit and within four weeks of its premier, the Junior Defenders had dropped to number 18 and matters only got worse. By the end of the 1981 season, the Junior Defenders were struggling to stay afloat. The future of the show was in jeopardy. Clearly, something drastic had to be done. (static crackling) - [Narrator] This Wednesday, get ready for the television event of the season. A showdown between good and evil. The most important episode of the Junior Defenders ever. The Junior Defenders season finale, Wednesday at 9:00, 8:00 Central and Mountain. - Apparently the folks that bring us the program Junior Defenders, have come up with yet another scheme to revive the show's sagging ratings. (audience laughing) And do you know what this scheme is? They're gonna kill off the little brats. (audience laughing) - Our backs were literally up against the wall. We knew that frankly if the show didn't finish in the top 10 that week, we were gonna get canned. (dramatic music) - This will never work Lord Wonton, the Junior Defenders are too smart for you. - [Lord Wonton] Nonsense Mr. President, soon they will fall right into my trap, and the whole world will be mine. (Lord Wonton laughs evilly) ♪ Junior Defenders ♪ - Not so fast Wonton. - Oh, the Junior Defenders. I've been expecting you. - Watch out Future Boy, it's a trap. - Silence. I have no choice but to beam you to a torture chamber on the planet Wontonium, where you'll die a slow painful death. (dramatic music) - You'll never get away with this Wonton. (Lord Wonton laughing evilly) (electronic music) - [Lord Wonton] And now Mr. President, every Earthling is my slave. And the whole world is mine. (laughing evilly) - [John] America was to be left hanging. The season finale broadcast received fairly good ratings, finishing the week at number 15. But it was too little, too late. The network decided to pull the plug. - This is a decision which has been difficult for everyone involved. Last night we did reach a conclusion. Junior Defenders, unfortunately will not be returning to the ABS lineup next fall. (crowd murmuring) We feel that the program has enjoyed a long prosperous run and that it maintained a loyal group of fans, even to the end. However, we do feel that the show has outlived it's popularity and we hope to search for new avenues of entertainment for the decade of the 1980s. - [Protesters] Bring back the show! Bring back the show! - [John] And just when it seemed that matters couldn't get any worse, tragedy struck. While en route to a crucial meeting at ABS in 1981, George Berryman was suddenly killed in a massive head-on collision. For Junior Defender fans, it was the end of the road. After four season, 182 episodes and two camis, the Junior Defenders was suddenly brought to a halt. Leaving both its fans and its stars completely out in the cold. (camera shutter clicking) Tommy Keen, who played Future Boy on the show, would spend years trying to recapture his childhood success. After hosting the short-lived children's show, Playtime With Tommy, his career would eventually descend into the world of hard core pornography. Jill Fields, who played Psychic Girl on the series, would later give up acting to start a new age vampire cult in Colorado. Mitch Stone, who played Radar Kid, was arrested in his late 20s on three counts of shoplifting and sentenced to five years in prison. But Jimmy Fletcher, who played Brain Child on the show, had perhaps the most tragic story of them all. - Hi, I'm Jimmy Fletcher from the Junior Defenders. - [John] In the years after the Junior Defenders, Jimmy Fletcher's acting career became limited mostly to TV commercials and occasional guest spots on the show Blossom. - Jimmy had a tough time in the years after the show was taken off the air. He felt, he felt bitter. - [John] As he grew older, Fletcher became a regular on the LA party scene and by the age of 28 Fletcher had spent his entire earnings on an all consuming cocaine addiction. - [Reporter] Jimmy are the rumors true, did they find cocaine on you? - [Reporter] Are you denying the allegation? - [John] After his release from rehab, Fletcher became increasingly reclusive, avoiding all contact with the media and completely disassociating himself from the Junior Defenders. - He cut himself off from everyone; family, friends. He moved up somewhere in New England. He was living all alone, in an old Winnebago. (upbeat triumphant music) - Good evening, this is World Nightly News. I'm Neal Knowles filling in for Bill Samuels. It has been a tense day for fans of the popular 1970s television series The Junior Defenders. Former cast member James Fletcher has been missing for over 12 hours and investigators are beginning to fear the worst. (shutter clicking) - [John] What you are about to see is Jimmy Fletcher's first interview in over 10 years. Because of the shocking unforeseen events that occurred during the interview's filming, the footage has never been released to the public until now. - [Jimmy] Is this on already, are we rolling? - No, no, he just has to adjust the focus. - No, the red light's on, that means that it's-- - This is Jimmy Fletcher interview, take one. - [John] The interview was arranged by veteran TV journalist Bill Samuels, anchor of the long running magazine show, 50/50. - [Jimmy] So what do you want me to do? - [Bill] Just act normal. - Just act normal. - Yeah you know, we thought we'd get get some shots of your everyday, normal routine, you know. - Oh I get it, this is one of those, where are they now pieces right. You know at age 11, Jimmy Fletcher was in the biggest TV show of all time. And now he's a total loser tonight, check it out. - [Bill] Jimmy we don't really know what angle we're gonna take on this piece. So we'll try to show you in the best light, okay. So cut the crap, let's just get started. So nice barbecue you got here Jimmy. - Hey, you like it, yeah. Here we have the deluxe outdoor patio. (laughs) We got the, you know, the pavilion area over here and this is our beautiful outdoor laundry facility. How am I doing Bill? - Oh great, great. Would you show us the inside. - Oh the interior, how could I forget, come on. - [Bill] How long you been living here? - [Jimmy] Oh, a couple of years. - [Bill] Out of choice? - [Jimmy] Yes, I was experimenting with different lifestyles, I hoped to expand my range as an actor. (Bill laughing) - Why did you decide to leave Hollywood? What was the final straw? - I don't know, just fed up with L.A. My acting career was going nowhere. - You ever wish you could go back in time, back to the days of the Junior Defenders? - No. - No? Why not? - 'Cause it was a tacky show. It didn't even deserve the attention it got. - [Bill] Well that's a bit harsh isn't it? - Yeah, but it's true. - [Bill] There are millions of fans who think otherwise. - Yeah I know, it's scary isn't it? (loud banging) - [Man] Open the door! - [Jimmy] What the fuck is that? - [Minnesota] Police, everybody freeze! Gimme your car keys! - [Jimmy] What do you want my car keys for? - [Bill] Just give 'em your car keys. - [Man] Where are your car keys? Show him which key it is! - [Jimmy] It's the silver key! - [Man] What's that camera for? - [Bill] We were filming an interview! (engine starting) (tires squealing) - Okay, one more question. You know that episode where Lord Wonton disguised himself as an Earthling and surprised you guys at your own headquarters? Remember that one? - Yes, what about it? - Well wouldn't Future Boy have known ahead of time that that was gonna happen? I mean if he can really see the future, it seems like. - I don't, I don't know. - All right look, can you guys turn your super powers on and off, I mean. - Oh my god. - What was the deal? - I don't know okay, I didn't write the show. - I mean if he's Future Boy, he should be able to see the future. - I don't know. - I mean what, can you guys turn your super powers on and off or where they just-- - I don't know, I didn't write the show. - It doesn't make any sense. He's Future Boy, why can he see the future sometimes and other times he can't see it. - I don't know! - It just doesn't make sense. - Oh my god, would you please shut up! - Okay. - Thank you! - Fine. - [John] Jimmy Fletcher had been taken hostage by two frighteningly deranged celebrity stalkers. Norman Nields, an obsessed fan of the Junior Defenders with a history of mental illness. And his notorious accomplice, Darryl Dunsmere. - I grew up on the Junior Defenders you know, you are our heroes man. I mean we really believed in these dudes you know. Sometimes it felt like they were my best friends, no matter how fucked up everything else gets, you always knew every week on Wednesday night the Junior Defenders would be on. No matter how deep the shit was they got themselves into, you always knew they'd beat the bad guys. - Would you tell me where you're taking me? I mean what? - Come here. - What the fuck is this? - [Norman] Get a shot of this. Look, this is our route. I figured it'd take about 10 days for us to get across the country. Now I've already got you, Jimmy Fletcher here in New England, and we're gonna drive down and get Mitch out of jail, then we're gonna drive all the way to Denver, pick up Jill, and meet Tommy in LA. - [Jimmy] So you're taking me back to LA? - Oh not just you, all the Junior Defenders. - Oh that's just great, what are you gonna do when you get there? You're gonna fucking kill us, aren't you? - No. - Great, what are you gonna, you're gonna hold us for ransom? - No, no, nothing like that. - What the fuck are you gonna do? - Restore you to greatness. - Restore me to greatness, what the fuck does that mean? - We're gonna resurrect the Junior Defenders. - You're gonna what? - We're gonna bring back the show. - Oh my god. - [Norman] Come on, aren't you excited? - Dude, yeah, I'm overflowing with joy. - I mean, you really felt they stood for something you know. They'd watch out for you and everything. Nothing's ever been the same since they got taken off the air. That's why me and Norm wanna bring 'em back. Dude, this is like our way of thanking them for all the cool stuff they taught us, you know man. (static crackling) - [Narrator] And now it's time for the Junior Defenders lesson of the week. Today on our show we learned that fighting is not nice. - That's right, and it's also not the best way to solve an argument. - [Narrator] Fighting is what happens when two sides don't get along. There are many kinds of fighting, including pushing and shoving, yelling and screaming, hitting and punching, stabbing, (guns firing) shooting, strangulation, (lady screaming) mutilation, (bomb exploding) and thermonuclear warfare. - So the next time you're mad at somebody remember. (guns firing) - If you don't have anything nice to say. - Don't say anything at all. - [Narrator] That's it for this week. See you next time on: ♪ Junior Defenders ♪ - Let me get this straight, you intend to go across the country, kidnapping the entire cast of the Junior Defenders, just so you can make more episodes of the show? - Mm-hmm, in fact I've got the first two episodes all planned out. They're gonna explain everything. What happens to the Junior Defenders on planet Wontonium. What happens to Earth with the Junior Defenders gone. - Well how are you planning on doing any of this? - What do you mean? - What do you think, Hollywood's gonna open up its arms and say here? I mean do you have any financing? - No. - Well do you have any equipment, have you thought about anything? - We'll get it, we'll find a way. - How? - We'll steal it. - Steal it, stealing's illegal. - So is kidnapping. - You got a point. Couldn't you have picked some other way to make your mark? I mean couldn't you have just shot a president or started a war or something normal like that? I mean why does it have to be this? - The Junior Defender fans have been waiting too long, that's why. - It was a television show man, don't you understand that? It's not real, it's television. - Television is better than real. (static crackling) - The radio was on in the office and all of a sudden I hear that Jimmy Fletcher is gone. You just can't prepare yourself for something like this you know. (static crackling) - [Reporter] Has there been any leads? - Not yet. - [Reporter] Is this a kidnapping? - That's the assumption we're going on. - [Reporter] Did you receive a ransom note? - No. - [Reporter] Do you think he will come out of this alive? - Your guess is as good as mine. (static crackling) - And according to official police reports, there's been no sign of him since 1983. (audience laughing) (static crackling) - [Martin] As authorities begin searching for clues in the case, one thing remains clear, the kidnapping of Jimmy Fletcher is the product of an extremely dangerous and highly sophisticated criminal mind. Martin Thompson, CNN News, Handenbush, Pennsylvania. (upbeat triumphant music) ♪ Junior Defenders ♪ - [Child] Future Boy what are we gonna do? The Dark Avenger's out on the loose again. - Oh my god, this is the Dark Avenger episode. This is my all time favorite episode. - That's great. - Want some? - No. - How did you do that? - Do what? - That just now, make everyone disappear like that. I've always wanted to know. - It's a special effect. - I know but how does it work? - Magic, Norman, it's all magic. - No come on, really. - I don't know okay. All I ever do is go to set, read my fucking lines and go home. - You know you're really not being a very good sport about this whole thing. - Day one of our captivity has come to a close. And there is no sign that our kidnappers plan to release us anytime soon. We are somewhere near the Ohio, Indiana border. Our next stop is somewhere in Indianapolis. - [Norm] You guys, dinner's ready. - As you can see, our captors do not appear to be violent at this moment, but it's difficult to predict how they would react. - Bill, I think Norm wants you guys to get some shots of him now. - All right, come on let's go get some shots. - [Jimmy] What are you saying, it's not gonna work. - [Norm] Why not? - [Jimmy] 'Cause they're prepared for that, they have guns and things. - So, we have guns. Oh, hi Bill. Are you hungry, I cooked up some hot dogs for you. - [Bill] Yeah, thanks - [Norm] You want some mustard? - Thanks I'm fine. - [Norm] How we doing on gas man? - Oh we got about half a tank. We'll probably have to fill up again in Iowa. - How 'bout food, we have enough food? - Oh, he's got plenty of stuff left in the fridge. - [Jimmy] Yeah I was prepared for this. - Yeah. You know what this reminds me of? - Dude, the Lost Planet episode. All right. - Future Boy, what are we gonna do? Our oxygen supply will only last two more hours. - Don't worry Radar Kid, I'm sure Brain Child has a plan. Right, Brain Child? - No man, I'm not going there. - Oh come on. - Right, Brain Child? - I'm gonna pass. - Right Brain Child? - I don't even remember what the line is. - Come on, you remember. - Say it dude. - Come on, you know the line, say it. - Oh for Christ's sake, just say the damn line. - That's right Future Boy, I intend to use my super intelligence to create an oxygen filtration cloning device. - You did it! - You got it man. (men laughing) (upbeat rock music) - So we're on our way to pick up Mitch now. Norm says he's got thrown in jail 'cause he got caught trying to steal some shit. I think him and me'll get along okay. - [John] The next victim on Norm and Neal's list was Mitchell T. Stone, formerly known to the world as Radar Kid. Stone was the classic case of an ex-child star gone bad. After getting fired from a series of part time minimum wage jobs, Stone was arrested on three counts of shoplifting. In the much publicized court case that followed, Stone later confessed to stealing over $300 worth of whips, bondage gear, and a prosthetic penis extender from a small Midwestern adult toy store. Despite his attorney's best efforts, Stone was sentenced to five years in this minimum security Indiana State prison. - Norman how many times do I have to tell you, this is not gonna work? You're not gonna be able to just go in there and break Mitch out of a fucking prison. - I'm telling you Jimmy, I've got a great plan. - Oh you got a great plan, that's great. You know how dangerous your plan is? - What are you worried about, you're not coming along. I'm the one who's gonna get shot at. - Not worried about, okay call me old fashioned if you want, but I really don't think that it's worth risking your life over a fucking television show. - Look Jimmy I appreciate your concern, but everything's gonna be fine. It's all gonna go off without a hitch. - I'm sorry your name's not on the list, and I suggest you turn your camera off and leave the premises immediately. - Oh for Christ's sakes, we're the crew from 50/50. We've been calling all week. They specifically told us to come down here on Thursday. We had to cancel the piece on Clinton just to be here. Do you understand? Do you have any idea who this man is next to me? Any idea at all? - Nope. - Well this is Bill Samuels, he happens to be one of the most highly respected journalist in the field today. Now I suggest you get on that phone right now and call the warden and tell him that Bill Samuels is here to do a piece on Mitch Stone, comprende? - Yeah. - How am I doing? - Real good, don't over do it. - This guy is so gullible, it's gonna be a piece of cake. - Don't count on it. - You've got to lighten up Bill. (both whispering) - Gentleman, could you please come here for a moment? - [Norman] Yeah, sure. - Bill Samuels right? - Yes. - Pleasure to meet you. I've been watching your show for years. It's a fine show. - Thank you. - And you are? - Jim. - Jim. - Jim Walker. - Nice to meet you Jim. Gentlemen I apologize for the misunderstanding. - That's quite all right. - And I hear that you're interested in interviewing one of our inmates. - [Norm] Yes that's right, Mitch Stone. - Mitch Stone. One of those celebrity interview, huh? - [Norm] Yeah that's right. - Stone, there we go. - I don't see why that should be too much of a problem Bill. - Great. - I'll have him brought out in about 10 minutes. - Actually, I was thinking, can we do the interview right in the cell? - Right in the cell? - Yeah, no guards, no handcuffs, it's much more dramatic. - You TV people like to live life dangerously don't you? (men laughing) I don't know, I got to see what, gum? - No. - I don't see that to be too much of a problem. - Great. - Have a couple of guys come down here, escort these gentlemen to cell block W2, will ya. - Sir you've been very helpful. - Bill. - Gentleman walk through here please. (metal detector buzzing) Hold it, extend your arms please. - It's probably just something in the bag. - Sorry about that, standard procedure. - Hey, you can never be too careful you know. - You wouldn't believe some of the crazies we get in here. - So do you like working here? - Well it's not bad, I've had worse jobs. - They pay you well? - It's not too bad, we get a good insurance program, dental coverage, the whole nine yards. - So you got a family and kids. - I do. - Couple of kids right? A lot of 'em into sports, they like it. - Nice clean facility you got here. Much further? - It's right here. Open W2 door, please. (door clicking and buzzing) Mitchell Stone. - [Mitch] Yeah. - [Guard] There's some guys out here that want to talk to you. - Oh goodie, I get to be on TV. - Mitch, it's an honor to meet you. My name is Norman Nields. - Who are you guys and how come they didn't tell me you were coming? - Actually we're doing a piece for the show 50/50 on the tragic disappearance of your costar, Jimmy Fletcher. We just wanted to get your reaction. Is that okay with you? - Hey, anything for that book, Tito. - That's the spirit. Actually, could we do this interview out in the hallway? - Why, what's wrong with the cell? - Well I mean it's too dark. The lighting's terrible, right Bill? - Yeah, this is terrible, it's much too dark in here. - Look the warden said we could do it out in the hallway. So can we just get this over with? - All right, you got five minutes. - [Norman] Is that okay with you? - Sure, whatever. - Come on. - Hey so, when is this gonna be on TV? - Uh, not for a while. - Shit, shit. (loud banging) - Terribly sorry. - Come on you guys, let's go! - Where are you taking me? What the hell's going on? Where you guys taking me? - [Norm] Come on, come on.

(gun firing) - They're gaining on us man, we're never gonna make it. (sirens blaring) What do you mean what do we do? You're the kidnapper, shoot back. - Shoot man, I don't want to hurt anybody. - Then just aim at the tires. (siren blaring) - I'll miss, I've never shot a gun before. - Jesus, let me do it then.

(static crackling) (upbeat triumphant music) - A shocking development tonight in the search for former child star Jim Fletcher. In what appears to be a copycat kidnapping, a second member of the Junior Defenders cast has suddenly vanished. - [Reporter] Is there a connection between the two kidnappings? - We haven't determined that yet? - [Reporter] Are the other cast members in danger? - [Officer] It's too soon to tell. - [Reporter] Is this the work of Osama Bin Laden? - Don't get your hopes up. - Mysteriously, one of the suspects bears a remarkable resemblance to missing ABS newsman Bill Samuels. - That was unbelievable, I feel like Clyde Barrow. I feel like I'm in a fucking Jimmy Cagney movie. - Right on man. - [Norm] That was great, that was incredible. - Nah, that was nothing. - No, that was better than Cops. - Where'd you learn to shoot like that? - When I started shoplifting. Hey man how you been? - Okay you know, I've had better weeks. - I never wanted to go into journalism. I always wanted to be Al Capone. - So why are you filming all this? - Don't ask. - It's for the record. - Record, what do you mean? - He means that he's crazy and he thinks this is all gonna be history one day. - It already is. - Well what's this all about? Are you trying to get a ransom out of all of this? - (laughs) No, no, no, no. He's an obsessed fan, all right. He's one of the Junior Defender groupies and he kidnapped us to force us to make new episodes of the show. - Are you serious? - Yes. - So you're doing all this, just to bring back the Junior Defenders show? - You don't think that's a good idea? (men laughing) - No! (laughs) It's great, it's fucking genius. - You're being sarcastic, right? - No, I think it's a good idea. - You really think so? - Yeah, shit I wish I had thought the idea up. So who's next, Jill or Tommy? - Well I was thinking since, you know-- - No, you're not going along with this. - Well why not, it might work? - Listen, he is crazy, he doesn't know what he's doing. - I don't know about that, I mean he's already gotten us national attention. - He doesn't know anything about television. - Think of George Berryman, remember? Don't worry he'll learn, right Norman? - Right. - Oh my god, all right Mitch you can do whatever you want but this is my Winnebago and you guys are out when we hit Kansas City. - Jimmy, Jimmy buddy come on relax. What about the loyalty to the fans? - What, my mind is made up. I'm not gonna go along with this psycho. - All right. - Yes fine. - Yeah, okay, here. - What are you doing? - Keep an eye on us there, Norman. - No problem. - You're insane, you're insane, you're both insane. You know I want to state for the record that everyone in this vehicle is out of their fucking mind. - Jim relax, he's a fan, he worships us. He ain't gonna hurt us. - How do you know that? - Because I know. Hey whether you like it or not, we were heroes at one time. An entire generation of Americans looked up to us. We can't let them down. We can't let them down. We can't let them down. (static crackling) - [Protesters] Bring back the show! Bring back the show! Bring back the show! Bring back the show! Bring back the show! Bring back the show! Bring back the show! Bring back the show! Bring back the show! Bring back the show! (static crackling) - [Jimmy] You know I can't believe that you're just gonna go along with this. Hello, five minutes ago the guy had a gun to your head and now you're like helping them. You're on their side. Hey Mitch, hello! Could you think logically for two seconds. Okay do you really think that anything is gonna come of this, okay anything. (metal clanking) Hey for Christ's sake man, would you fucking listen to me please! - Jim! - What? - When was the last time you had a role in anything? - It was four years ago. - And what would this role involve? - Pouring dog food into a bowl for a Purina ad. - I rest my case. - So what, what is that suppose to fucking mean? (metal clanking) What, would you get that thing out of my face please. Come on go, go do something else, go away! - We believe that the van carrying Mitchell Stone is headed west. Most likely somewhere along highway 54 or highway 36. We estimate that they are traveling in the central Missouri area, but we've been unable to track down its exact location at this time. The Missouri State Police have been placed on alert. - [Reporter] Is that van also carrying Jimmy Fletcher? - It's unlikely, we believe this to be a copycat kidnapping. - [Reporter] Are the two remaining cast members in danger? - We have encouraged them to take some precautionary measures. They both plan to hire temporary bodyguards. - [Reporter] Have there been any reports of torture? - We certainly can't rule that out. You have to understand that we are dealing with some deranged individuals here. We can only imagine what Jim and Mitch have been subjected to. - [John] America was devastated by the kidnappings. A nationwide moment of silence was held in honor of Jim Fletcher and Mitch Stone. - Let us pray. Eternal God. - [John] Across the country and around the world, Junior Defender fans everywhere were praying for the kidnapped stars.

All my life, I feel like I've been on channel one. Now me and Norm are bringing back the Junior Defenders, I feel like I've moved up to channel two. - Your time is up Lord Wonton, your reign of terror on this planet has lasted far too long. - That's right, the Junior Defenders are back and this time we're ready for you. I don't like that line. - Oh come on, you guys are doing so great. - What's wrong with that line? - It's tacky, you know no human being would ever actually say that. - You're not a human being, you're a super hero. - Well that's my motivation? - You're a super hero, you want to save the world. Now come on, let's take it from the top on page two, okay. - You know actually, we're gonna need someone to play Lord Wonton. - Yeah. - [Norm] Shoot, I'm ready. Okay Bill. - What? - [Norm] Would you mine playing Lord Wonton for us. - Oh, well all right, all right. - Great. Okay you've only got a couple of lines on that page. - [Bill] Huh? - [Norm] You've only got a couple of lines here. - [Bill] All right. - So whenever you guys are ready. - Not so fast Lord Wonton, - The Junior Defenders, impossible. But how? - Wait, wait, wait. - No? - No, you're a bad guy. - Oh. - You've gotta sound scary. Menacing. - Okay. - Okay so let's try it again. - Not so fast Lord Wonton. - The Junior Defenders, but impossible. - [Norm] Wait, wait, wait. - The Junior Defenders, impossible! - That's right. - But how? - Easy, Brain Child built an electrodiffusion transport device out of old tin plates on planet Wontonium. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, that was pretty good. - What? - Well under play it a little more okay. - Underplay it? - Yeah, let's okay. - I've always been fascinated by the potential of the human mind. Over the years I've tried everything from Tony Robbins to Scientology, but nothing really made a difference to me. - [John] Jill Fields had come a long way since her days as Psychic Girl. In the years after the Junior Defenders, Fields had gone from TV child actress to world renowned new age author. - I created a philosophy that really works. It has worked for me and it can work for you. - [John] In her mid 20s, Jill Fields founded a new age research institute called The Center For Undead Living. Based in the mountains outside of Denver, Colorado, the institute quickly grew to over four million members worldwide. The requirements for all joining members included, rising at dusk, nightly meditation, and handing over all worldly possessions to the care of Jill Fields. Jill Fields personally hosted the institute's nightly infomercial, known as the Vampire Friends Network. - And welcome back to the Vampire Friends Network. I'm Jill Fields. As you know we are always here to show you how your vampire energy can help you in your career, your friendships, and your love life. Before we take your incoming calls, why don't we meet a few people whose lives have been changed forever by the Vampire Friends Network. Take a look. - Like most people, I used to be afraid of vampires. - When I first called the Vampire Friends Network, my life was a mess. - When I first heard about the Vampire Friends Network, I thought to myself, this is so stupid I just have to call. And when I made that call, I was immediately surprised. - [Announcer] Jill Fields' Vampire Friends Network has helped millions of people discover the vampire within them. People like actress Mila Nermie, comedian Pauly Shore, and first lady Laura Bush. Call now and you too can experience the Vampire Friends Network. - One simple phone call changed my life. - The Vampire Friends Network showed me that vampires are normal people, just like you and me. - For the first time in my life I'm really a believer. Thank you Vampire Friends Network. (audience clapping) - These are just a few examples of the kind of difference the Vampire Friends Network has already made in the lives of millions of people just like you. Now we're gonna meet one of those people up close and in person. My first guest today, not only is a long practicing vampire, she also happens to costar on the daytime soap, Intensive Care. Please welcome Carla Stanton. (audience clapping) (upbeat music) Carla you look wonderful. It's great to have you on the show. - Thanks Jill, it's great to be here. - Now you've been a practicing vampire for, is it 10 years? - 11. - 11. (gun firing) (everyone screaming) - [Norm] Freeze, freeze, everybody freeze! (audience screaming) (static crackling) (audience screaming) - [Audience Member] You bastard, what have you done with them? - Relax, relax, they're okay. - Give it up asshole! - Look listen, no just listen to me, listen to me. This is not a kidnapping, this is a movement. A movement to restore heroes to this great nation. This is not about entertainment, it's much bigger than that. Friends, this is about culture, popular culture. The culture of the people. You see, there was a time not so long ago when the youth of this country could turn on their television sets and witness noble, heroic deeds. I'm trying to bring back that age of glory. Ladies and gentlemen look at me, look at me, I'm no kidnapper. I've never wanted to hurt anyone. I'm just a humble fan who wants his show back. - Wait a minute, are you saying you're gonna make new episodes of the Junior Defenders show? - That's right, all new episodes! With the original cast! - I say give the boy a chance. (audience murmuring) - Come on. - Just a minute. - Mark my words, the wait is almost over! The Junior Defenders shall soon return! (audience cheering and applauding) (static crackling) - Dammit it's been 12 years and no one around here seems to give a damn about what happened to them. - [Announcer] Coming next week on ABS. - I'm gonna have to leave you for a while. - Leave, Norman what for? - [Announcer] A four part mini-series you'll never forget. Based on a true story. - [Man] We need a driver for the van. You with me on this one? - I don't know man, this is big. I just don't know if I want to get myself wrapped up in something like this, you know what I'm saying. - [Announcer] He was on a mission to rewrite history. - Darling please don't go, it's dangerous. - Afraid I don't have a choice. - [Announcer] And nothing would stand in his way. - The people have a right to know. Derrick, I know what I'm doing. Trust me. - We've pinpointed his location, he's heading across Southern Ohio. (dramatic music) There's nothing we can do to stop him. - Jimmy, you're coming with me. (man yelling) - [Announcer] A story of courage, passion, and one man's quest to fight for his beliefs. - The show must go on! (audience cheering) - [Announcer] The Norman Nields Story. Television never had a more loyal fan. (audience cheering) Next week on ABS. - Okay one more question, I just gotta know one more thing. - Norman, put the gun down please, we're talking here. - First answer the question. - What, what is the question Norman? - You know that episode when Psychic Girl travels to planet Wontonium? - Yes. - Does she hear everyone's thoughts in English or Wontonese? - Wontonese, it just happens to sound exactly like English. - Oh. - You know could you put the gun down please. I have some calls to make, it's distracting. Hi, hi, Wanda. Wanda it's Jill. (laughs) I'm fine, no I'm fine, I'm fine. We're in, I don't know, New Mexico somewhere. Listen, I want you to set up some press. Some exclusives, just call around and feel it out. Yeah and I need an appointment at Jose E. Bear. Afternoons are better, right. I'm gonna call you from LA. Okay, bye. Hey guy, how you doing? - [Mitch] I've been okay. - Yeah we couldn't be better. - Good, glad to hear that. I'm fine, I'm fine, not to worry. Don, did the ratings come in yet for today? Great, oh that's great, all right. - Jill, how could you be so calm about all of this? - What do you mean? - What do I mean, did you put this on your schedule of events? - Of course. - You're serious aren't you? - Yeah, I couldn't pass up an opportunity like this, okay. - Opportunity, see I told you. - Oh yeah, you know you're right, you're right, I stand corrected. You two are obviously operating on some plane of reality that I'm not qualified to understand. - Jimmy, do you understand the vampire energy? - It's a crock of shit. - Do you know, no. You're vampire energy is your ability to bite down hard into life and suck it dry. Every opportunity, every situation, any person, you just suck out whatever it is you can use, right? Money, power, contacts, location, whatever. If you think about it that way, Norman is actually a blessing in disguise. - A blessing in disguise, you're crazy. - Mm-mm, I'm crazy. (static crackling) - What do we want? - [Protesters] The Junior Defenders! - When do we want it? - [Protesters] Next fall! - What do we want? - [Protesters] The Junior Defenders! - When do we want it? - [Protesters] Next fall! - What? - [Protesters] The Junior Defenders! - When? - [Protesters] Next fall! (static crackling) Hey, hey, ho, ho, let Norman Nields bring back the show. Hey, hey, hey, hey, ho, ho, ho, ho, let Norman Nields bring back the show. Hey, hey, hey, hey. - [Reporter] Rallies, like the one you are seeing here are occurring in major cities throughout the country today. Fans of the popular '70s TV show, the Junior Defenders seem to have found a new leader for their cause and his name is Norman Nields. (guzzling loudly) (men chuckling) (Jimmy coughing) - You got any more beers left? (guzzling loudly) (men belching) That was brought to you by beer. The beverage of champions. (men laughing) - We should never have come back to Earth. The Junior Defenders aren't wanted here anymore. We should never have come back to Earth, the Junior Defenders aren't wanted here anymore. Radar Kid what are we gonna do? We should never have come back to Earth. The Junior Defenders aren't wanted here anymore. - Don't worry Psychic Girl, nothing can stop us. We're the Junior Defenders. - I like it, it's very subtle. (both laughing) - I wanna ask you a question. - All right. - All right let's say your whole crazy plan works, okay. You actually make a new episode of the show, what are you gonna do after that? - Make another one I guess. - All right, let's say you make thousands of episodes, you get bored of that, what are you gonna do when you're done? - I don't know. - I knew it. - What would you do if I were to let you go free, right now? - Probably move up to Oregon. Start an organic vegetable farm. It's something I've been thinking about for some time now. - Hmm, really? - No. (all laughing) - The Scientologists actually believe that the clam is like the highest form of life on Earth. And that is what all humans are supposed to aspire to become. - So they're like clam supremacists? - Basically, yeah. - So you mean to tell me, you quit acting to join a clam supremacists cult? (scoffs) And I thought I had problems. - Hey at least I wasn't running around robbing convenient stores, was I? I didn't join that religion, did I? - Oh right and clam supremacy is definitely a more worthy cause. - All right, Bill. - Me? - Yeah, yeah, you've been pretty quiet Mr. Undercover Journalist, what would you do if Norman let you go free right now? - Simple, I'd take all this footage and go right to work on a big documentary about this whole trip. - [Jimmy] Cool. - Yeah, and we'd air it a five part special prime time, the whole sha-bang. And we'd finally kick 60 Minutes ass. (men laughing) (Bill imitation explosions) (men laughing) - What about this part? Would you put this conversation right here in it? - Fuck no. (Jimmy laughing) - I didn't think so. (static crackling) - So we now have every reason to believe that the last remaining cast member, Tom Keen, is in serious personal danger. As a result, every precaution will be taken to ensure his safety. - [John] The final victim on Norman Nields list was the former star of the Junior Defenders, Tommy Keen. After dropping out of Malibu Beach Community College at age 24, Keen made a brief foray into the world of adult entertainment. (jazzy music) - [Narrator] Coming soon from Rockhard Video, it's Future Boy, like you've never seen him before. Former child star Tommy Keen starring in Macho Superhero Studs. - [John] Tom Keen would soon go on to appear in such titles as Boys In The Buff, Cockfighter, and Anal Surprise. In recent years, Keen had graduated to the more respectable role of TV commercial spokesman. - [Man] All right everyone, mark it. - [Man] Scene two, take 15. - [John] Keen had been filming a commercial at Galaxy Studios in the San Fernando Valley during the week of the kidnappings. At the advice of the advice of the FBI, the filming location was secretly moved to Majesty Studios in Hollywood. Meanwhile, Norman Nields was cunningly preparing to hunt down his final victim. - I think we should take this little road 50 right through Eureka. - No man we go to take 80. Norm what are we gonna do about Tommy? We still don't have a clue where the dude is. - I just, for the time being just keep heading west. That's all we can do? - Man how do we know he's in California? Like what if he took off to Hawaii or something? - Guys, I know where he is. - [Norman] Cool. - We speak, he called me on the phone a few days ago. - Where, where is he? - Later, first Norman, you sign. - What is this? - This is a contract Norman. It outlines the basic points of our deal. - Deal, like what do you mean deal? - If you guys get Junior Defenders back on the air, I want my infomercial to have guaranteed rights to the time slot immediately following the show for it's entire first year. If the show goes into syndication, I want a significant piece of the back end. - Yeah, great, sounds good to me. - Wonderful, wonderful. Pen please, thank you. - So like, where is Tommy? - Tommy is shooting a commercial at Majesty Studio until the end of the week. - Majesty Studios, where's that? - Lala land. (whimsical music) - [John] I always thought it was kind of amusing they decided to call this place the City Of Angels. I mean the guys that started this town, must have had a really twisted sense of humor. Or maybe they were just being sarcastic. I mean I have this theory that Los Angeles is really just a mirage, it's just an illusion. I mean think about it, the entire fucking city is run on illusion, I mean the entire city runs on it. - You know it's funny, I think the people that like this town the most, are the ones that have only seen it on TV. (static crackling) - You know is it just me Ann, or do you have this strange feeling that Norman Nields is gonna burst into the studio any minute now? - Don't say that, you might encourage him. - It's hard to believe that just two weeks ago, no one even knew who Norman Nields was. (squeaky rewinding) He has managed to round up all but one of the Junior Defender stars. Nields was last spotted traveling somewhere near the California-Nevada border. And by all accounts, he's headed for Hollywood. - This is it man, we're there. We're finally there, you know. It's like you can feel the energy swirling all around you. It's rising up out of the streets or something. Smell the air dude, it's beautiful. It's almost like I been here before, you know what I'm saying. It's like I've already driven these streets. I'm home man, I'm finally home. (upbeat country music) - [Man] Hold on stop, we're gonna do it again. Just leave it rolling. - I know that was terrible, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. - Tom, how many times do we have to do this? We've been here all fucking day man. - [Norm] Okay everyone listen up, we're almost there. Now when we get to the movie studio, we're all gonna hide back here, and Darryl's gonna get us past the guard, any questions? - [Man] Mark it. - [Man] Scene two, take 15. - Before we get there, I just wanna say, that no matter what happens, it's been really great getting to know you guys. And as long as I live, I'm never gonna forget this. - Norm, neither will we. - [Man] Quiet everyone, mark it. (gun firing) (people gasping) - Freeze, everybody calm down! (people yelling) Ladies and gentlemen, there's been a slight change in today's production schedule, we apologize for the inconvenience. (shutter clicking) Okay listen up, we made a limited number of copies so some of you are gonna have to share. The shooting schedule isn't completed yet so we're gonna have to wait. You got a copy, right Jim? - Yep, it's here. - Right on. Hey how's it going? - Fuck off. - Hey Tommy, man lighten up, it's gonna be fun, trust me. It'll be just like the old days, huh? Do I look okay on camera? Guys that throne looks awesome. What do we got here? - Oh we have some nice fresh salsa, corn chips, blue-- - Salsa. - Yeah. - [Norm] What's it made of? - Oh I took some nice fresh plump tomatoes and onions and cilantro, I think it's fabulous. I think you should try some. - Looks great. - Thanks. - Tommy, I can't tell you what an honor it is to be working with you. - Yes, same here I guess. - Look, I've been meaning to ask you a question. You know that episode where Lord Wonton disguised himself as an Earthling. - And he catches us by surprise, sure. - Right, okay, wouldn't Future Boy have known that that was gonna happen ahead of time? - You know I've always wondered that myself. - Really? - Yeah, in fact I even brought it up to George Berryman the day we shot that scene. - You did, what did he say? - Well he told me that he hadn't really thought about it. And no one in their right mind would ever care. - Oh. - Norm, can I talk to you for a second over here? - [Norm] Yeah. - Does he have to film everything I do. I just feel really uncomfortable. (shutter clicks) - [John] As Norman was about to learn, Tom Keen had recently developed a chronic case of stage fright. After a traumatizing experience on the set of Butt Busters 3, Keen had found himself unable to function in front of a camera. - What about that commercial you were just doing? - I spent three weeks in therapy working up the courage to do that. - Three weeks? - Three weeks. My therapist has me doing these breathing exercises and past life-- - [Man] Attention Mr. Nields, attention Mr. Nields! The building is completely surrounded. Repeat, the building is completely surrounded. Please surrender immediately. Repeat, please surrender immediately. - Guys, seriously what are we gonna do? - Norman they got us surrounded and I hate to say it, but I think you should turn yourself in. I mean they're never gonna let us go-- - We're not gonna give up, we're not-- - Oh Norman wait a second okay, would you listen to me for a minute? - Guys, guys, guys! Relax, relax, relax. - What, what, what? - Thank you and great, goodbye. It's fine, it's all taken care of. They're gonna give us 24 hours before they break in. It's been handled. - What? - It's part of the plan. - Plan, what plan? - Yeah. - [Jimmy] What are you talking about? - You don't think it's that easy to get past them do you? - Who's them? - They let us come here. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. The FBI wanted us to come here? That's crazy. - The FBI, this is much bigger than that. - Who, the CIA? - No, the media. - [All] Media? (static crackling) (upbeat music) - Night has fallen over the city of the angels, and the Junior Defenders hostage standoff still appears to have no end in sight. (static crackling) - The governor of California, has declared a state of emergency. (static crackling) - Federal officials are now trying to avoid a disaster. (static crackling) - Celebrity kidnappings, Monday on Cassandra. (static crackling) - [Bill] Today, I Lord Wonton ruler of Earth, declare this a world wide holiday, celebrating my historic defeat of the vile scum once known as the Junior Defenders. - Not so fast Wonton. - The Junior Defenders, but how? - [Norm] Cut! First of all he's gotta say the line, vile scum as, and then you'll come in, okay. - No, no, we cut the vile scum, don't you remember? - I tried. - No we've gotta leave that in 'cause that's his cue. - Well I thought-- - We're leaving it in okay. - I got it. - Okay when you come in be more triumphant because. - Triumphant? - Yeah you've been on that planet for 12 years. - Oh right. - And you're really angry at this guy. Now let's take it again please. Bill, you're doing great. - Do I have to say vile scum? - [Norm] I wish you would. - [Bill] Ah. - [Jimmy] I think I got it though Norm. - Okay let's try it again. - [Jimmy] It's a little hot, Norm. - [Norm] We'll live with it. - [Jimmy] Whatever. - Scene one, take two. - And action! - [Bill] Greetings people of Earth, today marks my 12th year. - Wait, cut! - That's not right. - What? - I'm sorry. - [Norm] Bill, Bill, you've got to be more menacing. - What? - Can you please be more menacing? - Yeah all right, I'm sorry. (shutter clicking) - [Norm] I thought we already did this? - We did, now this is a different part of the agreement. This gives me full rights to all the Junior Defenders merchandise tie-ins. You know places like Lithuania and outer Zimbabwe, outer Mongolia, you know whatever, you don't need to worry about it, it's very standard. - Okay. - Good, good, and now on this page. Who is making the decisions about these television shows? Network executives. - Right. - These people have no creative juice. - Right, right. - You are a brilliant maverick. I want to be in business with you. - Thank you. - This will make us co-producers and I, aside from brief appearances will handle all of the business. - Okay. - Yeah, all right, so you sign at the bottom there and we'll be in business together. Good, actually it makes me executive producer. But we can be a company, Nields and Fields. - Hey I like that. - Yes baby. - Oh yeah, not so fast Wonton. Oh yeah, well not so fast Wonton. Not so fast Wonton. (Bill screams) - [Norm] Wait, wait, wait, cut, cut~ - [Bill] The Junior Defenders, but how? - [Jimmy] What, what's the matter? - You gotta be quicker on your entrance. - Quicker? - I have a few suggestions I wanted to make about my character. - Go ahead, shoot. - Well what do think about giving Future Boy some more nuances? - Nuances, what do you mean? - Well the thing I always hated about my character was that he was so one dimensional. What about giving him some deep- seated inner conflict or something. - Inner conflict, I like that. - Right, it's like he's got this repressed dark side lurking underneath the surface. - Yeah, yeah, exactly. - I think he's just looking for his own spinoff show. - Maybe. (static crackling) - There has been a report that Mr. Nields has just completed shooting the first scene. (static crackling) - All attempts to stop him thus far, have been futile. (static crackling) - [Reporter] In a surprise move tonight, the Palestine Liberation Organization has voiced its support for Norman Nields. - The network coverage of the stand off was getting astronomical ratings. And for about two days straight, it was pretty much all there was on the air. People were watching this at home, people were watching this at work, kids were watching this at school. I mean it was the best thing to happen to TV since OJ. (musical whooshing) - [Reporter] When Jill Fields was kidnapped, UNN was there. (people screaming) When Norman Nields took a film crew hostage, UNN was there. (people clamoring) No other network gives you more in depth 24 hour coverage of the dramatic standoff with Norman Nields. UNN, news the way America likes it. - [Norm] Hey guys, how's it going? - Good Mr. Nields, we're almost done. - Good, keep it up. - Future Boy what are we gonna do, we never should have come back to Earth. The Junior Defenders aren't wanted here anymore? - We can't give up hope Psychic Girl, we're the Junior Defenders. - I just want to tell you guys that you're doing a really great job, really. - Thanks Norman, that's really nice of you. - Yeah Norman that just warms my heart. When do I do my scene? - 'Bout 20 minutes. - I hate to wait Norman. - Okay, okay, we have one more scene to do and then you're in the next scene. - Fine whatever, I'll be in makeup. - I'm gonna need a little bit more time to prepare, I don't think I'm ready. - Why, you're doing fine, this is great. - Really, you really think I'm doing okay? - Yeah, this is just like I pictured it, it's great. - I just gotta get myself mentally prepared for the camera. - Oh for Christ's sake, not this again. (Tom stuttering) Tom, Tom, listen to me. Remember back to the old days? Okay, now repeat after me. Center, it's okay for me to be a superhero. - It's okay for me to be a-- - To be a superhero. ♪ Junior Defenders ♪ - No, Future Boy, what are we gonna do now? We should never have come back to Earth, the Junior Defenders aren't wanted here anymore. - We can't give up hope Psychic Girl, we're the Junior Defenders. (classical music) - [Norm] Okay Bill, we are ready for you. (electronic bubbling tones) - [Bill] Junior Defenders, but how? - Easy, Brain Child made an electrodiffusion transport device out of some old tin plates on Planet Wontonium. - Yes, your days are through. (shutter clicking) - You could make it beep right? - Yeah, we can totally make it beep. - [Norm] Action. (Lord Wonton laughing) (metal clanks) - Shit. (shutter clicking) - [Norm] Action! - Face it Wonton, the Junior Defenders are back. - Yeah, and this time we're ready for you. - Cut. Okay this is scene four, let's get ready for the big scene, let's get it right. - Hey Norm man, we got to pick up the pace. - [Norm] How much time do we have left? - Only 11 hours. - How many more shots? - 28, and we still gotta finish and put this all together. - We'll get it, we'll get it done. - I don't know. - Hey Norm, would you like more guacamole or maybe some more salsa. - More salsa. - Okay. - Hey Norman? - Yeah. - [Man] I'm down to my last tape. We've got less than an hour left on it, what do you want me to do? - Just keep it rolling. - Norm! - What! - Bad news man. - What now? - They said they were shutting off the power. - Shit! - What are you gonna do now man? - Hey, hey, listen. Tell them that if they shut off the power, you'll kill us all. - (chuckles) You're really good at this aren't you? - Bullshit my boy, that's all it is. (static crackling) - Norman Nields has just announced that if any further attempts are made to interfere with his guerrilla style production, he will immediately respond with quote, ritualistic slaughter. (static crackling) (Junior Defenders yelling) - Cut, okay we have to get this scene from one more angle, then we'll take a break. I know everyone's tired, so try and keep the energy up all right. - Hey Norman, Norman, Norman, how was I in that last close up? Was I okay or? - Perfect. - Are you sure? I mean it felt like it was okay, but I'm just not sure you know. - Yeah just try and sustain the energy and everything will be fine. - Okay. (helicopter whirring) - You can't stop us Wonton, we'll keep coming back. - [Wonton] I admire your persistence. It should suit me well. - What are you talking about? - [Wonton] Once I activate the evil conversion chamber, you and the other Junior Defenders shall be once and for all and forever my humble willing servants. (laughing evilly) - Okay first positions, everybody get ready. - Scene four, take five. - [Norm] And action. - [Wonton] You and the other Junior Defenders shall be once and for all and forever my humble willing servants. (laughing evilly) (buzzer buzzing) Oh, shit. - [Norm] Cut, cut, everybody just stay where they are. - [Man] I can't see anything. - [Jill] What happened? - [Norm] They turned off the power, everybody just calm down. Darryl! - [Darryl] Over here man. - [Norm] See if you can find a match or something. (people chattering) (static crackling) - Good morning I am Neal Knowles. This is an ABS Special Report. As the world enters day two of the Junior Defenders hostage standoff, America's patience has begun to run thin. Less than an hour ago, the president gave the okay for federal officials to cut off the power supply to the Hollywood sound stage still occupied by Norman Nields. All communications with the kidnappers has been severed as a result. The FBI has defended the power shut off as a last ditch attempt to bring Mr. Nields to a peaceful surrender. But federal officials now concede a peaceful surrender is looking less likely all the time. (engines whirring) (helicopter whirring) - [John] With a violent confrontation potentially looming, demonstrators across the country quietly gathered to send a message to Washington. - You know everyone keeps saying Norman's a freak or something. But he's not, he's just a normal, ordinary guy. A normal, ordinary guy who's trying to make the world suck a little bit less, you know. (static crackling) (audience clapping) - So I hear Norman Nields is going to launch his own network. (audience laughing) Yeah, apparently he's going to hold on to the hostages until he takes over Fox. (audience laughing) Whatever works! Tonight, our first presenter is one of the hottest up and coming talents in Hollywood. And to present the award for best animal training, in a made for television mini series. - Everybody freeze! (audience screaming) - Freeze, everyone freeze! (audience screaming) - Nobody move! (audience screaming) (Mitch speaking faintly) (static crackling) (everyone chattering) - Okay hello, hello can everyone hear me? Okay, Frank, I'd like to thank you for that flattering introduction a moment ago. So anyway, I'd like to introduce the man who's responsible for our surprise gathering here tonight. Without any further adieu ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Norman Nields, Norman. (audience murmuring) Let's hear it for him. - Thank you Jim, Frank, Tommy, Jill, Mitch, members of the academy. It's a pleasure to be here tonight. Ladies and gentlemen, people of America, citizens of Earth, years ago a man by the name of George Berryman created one of the finest cultural institutions of all time. And tonight after more than a decade of struggle, we have come to restore that fine institution to the living rooms of the world. Would somebody be so kind as to put this in the projector? Thanks, appreciate it. (audience murmuring) Well, without any further adieu, I'd like to present to you all, the first episode of the new Junior Defenders show. Could somebody get the lights?
