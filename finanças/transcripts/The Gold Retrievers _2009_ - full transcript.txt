Long ago, as the Americas lie untouched and unblemished, travelers from afar boarded grand vessels and crossed choppy waters. A merciless army of warriors plundered the new world and great ancient civilizations. They were known as the conquistadors. Proudly shipping their stolen treasure back to their queen, they were heralded as heroes of Spain. But greed knows no bounds. A small group of conquistadors decided to steal the gold for themselves. They sailed up the coast to what is now California. But mother nature had her own plans. Only one soul survived that torturous night, a shrewd and cunning conquistador named Don Antonio Miguel Torres. Aided by the natives, he hid the fortune deep within a cave in an uncharted mountain forest. Even today, few are willing to brave this treacherous terrain, fraught with natural and unnatural pitfalls. To help him find his way upon his return, Don Miguel made two maps, one of parchment and one a medallion. It told of the way through the forest and warned of booby-traps and curses. Years later, he returned to claim the riches. Don Miguel was never heard or seen again. Time and again, brave souls have searched the cursed forest for the treasure, none known to come out alive, even as the town of Santa Rosarita grew up from nothing, prospered, and then fell victim to economic hard times, and all the while, the fortune of gold lay hidden in the woods beyond. Woo. Whoa. Whoa. Oh, oh, hey. Whoa! Oh, sorry! Hey! Hey! You darn kid! You nearly scraped the paint! What are you doing? He nearly scraped the paint! We gotta try to act natural. We gotta try to fit in here, okay? Okay, okay. Be one of the locals. Okay, okay. You get me? Okay. Okay. Come on. Whoa! Are you okay? I think I'll live. You should watch where you're going with that thing. You new in town? I just moved in this week. Look who we've got here. What you got there, Peters? More junk that mutt dug up? None of your business what it is. This kid's forever digging up junk, him and that dog. You'd think it'd be worth something, the way he hordes around old rocks and sticks. But you know what, Peters? It's not, just like you. Just our local nobody! Yeah, a local nobody. Lost cause, just like that mangy mutt! Really? You're in town less than a week and you already hang out with Rachel? Skip it, Peters! You're a loser. Always gonna be a loser. And you're the last thing a girl like that's gonna take a look at. Right, Ana? I said, right? I don't know him well enough to make a judgment like that. I'll take that! Thank you. What a loser. So is that new girl. Mr. Peters, I think you got it all wrong. No, Sir, you do. Okay, a big mega center like Ultra-Mart comes to town, the first thing that happens is all the local businesses die. The town dies, Mr. James. The town is already dying. I'm trying to save it. I'm not trying to destroy anything here, that's why I think I'm making a very generous offer. Right, to buy me out. Changes my slow death to murder, wouldn't you say? How many other towns have you killed, Mr. James? I'm gonna need your answer by the end of the week, so I just, do me a favor and be smart about it, all right? My answer's no. Think about it. Hey! Who loves ya! All right. Hey bud. Ultra-Mart guy again? Yep. The store this guy wants to build is gonna kill this town. He thinks buying me out is gonna fix everything. Well, wouldn't it? Wouldn't even cover what I owe on a small business loan. Listen, Josh, if we're gonna stand our ground, gonna need to cut back on a few things, okay? Your mum's over at your grandmother's. She talked about us moving in with her for a while, just until we get back on our feet. But Grandma lives in a condo. They don't allow pets. We are gonna make some sacrifices, right? Hm? Come on, Bosco. I won't let anything happen to you. You'll be okay. I promise. Say, you fellas wouldn't happen to have a hammer I could borrow, would ya? Stay calm, act natural. No, no, sorry, Officer, we got no hammer! Oh, no, wait a minute. We got a hammer right here! Thank you. Yeah. What? Hey, hold up, boys. I'll get this hammer back to you right quick. Oh, no, no, no, we don't need it! We don't need it, okay? We got so many hammers! (Mumbling) Come on, Bosco, let's go. Let's get outta here. Bosco, just quit it. What's the use anyways? What's this? Couldn't be. Did you see that? Oh my. Boy, I think you finally found something! Let's go show Dad, come on! Look, things are just a little bit tough right now. I'm doing the best that I can. I'm not asking you for anything. I'm asking for a couple more days. I understand. Dad, look what Bosco found! Dad! Listen, listen, my son just walked in, I need to go. I'll take care of the money, don't worry. Dad, look, look! You guys are all riled up, huh? What's going on? Well, I was out with Bosco and he started digging up some stuff. Digging up? Digging up where? Mrs. Vandiver's? No, no, no, no. No? The Ultra-Mart construction site. Okay. And so he dug up this thing. It's really cool. Let's see it. It's pretty cool. Cool? Dad, I think this might be the conquistador's medallion. You remember, I did a report on it last year. The legend is that a conquistador named Don Michael, or something like that, he made a medallion out of gold. Maybe this is our chance to save our house, the town, and then I can keep Bosco. Come here, let me take a closer look at it. What do you think? What do you think? I don't think this is it, Josh, I'm sorry. Look, it's made of tin. Okay, this isn't gold. It's probably some kid's old toy he threw away. It's pretty cool-looking though. Dad, you don't think that maybe, anyway possible it's.. Josh. Come on. It isn't fair. I know. I know. Now look, when you grow up, you'll learn that there's a heck of a lot of things in this world that aren't fair, and you can't dwell on those things that you can't control. Right? Stay focused on the future. Sometimes, that means you take a step backwards before you can take two steps forwards. You understand? And Bosco, he needs you to stay strong right now, right? Nobody needs to see their best friend all sad. Now you cheer up. I just thought that if we were to find the treasure, then everything would go back to normal, the way it was before all this happened. Hey. You don't think I'd love a treasure right now? Look, I gotta focus on you, your mom, and our future. All right, this is the time when you focus on what's most important, that's family and, Josh, that's my treasure. Well, then what about Bosco? He's part of the family too. I'm sorry, buddy. Look, they're gonna take good care of him, I promise you. All right? Hey Josh, I don't want you out there in the woods doing any treasure hunting. Okay, they're not safe. They're off limits. Josh, okay? Okay. Let's go, Bosco. Make sure you're back for lunch. Hey, I'll see you back here for lunch? It's got potential. Ha, potential! It's a ground with potential. I like the way you think, Professor. That's what's good about you. I know! You're always thinking.. Hey. Hey, you okay, Sir? Here you are, young fella. What are you do, oh, what you got there, kid? Just something I found. Oh, really? Well, that's what we do too. We find things. We're artifact collectors. Collect, that's what we do! Big ones! Oh, yeah, they're giant. We'd be happy to give you something for that. We got a little something, little cash. Come on, we have, well, how about if we pay ya next time we see ya? I mean, you could just.. I don't want a layaway program. Well, how about some of that old time, small town charm, sonny boy? Come on, Bosco, Bosco! Whoa! Professor! What? Let him go! Yeah, but that was the.. That was ours if you hadn't given back to him, you moron! But you said I was supposed to be natural! Well, of course be natural! He dropped it, I picked it up! What's more natural? But you don't jump a kid in broad daylight! You gotta be smart. Smart. Smart! Smart, yeah, smart, use it, use your noggin! Use it! I'll use it! Use your noggin! Watch me! Oh, don't worry! I'll get smart! I'm your number one fan. I'll show you smart. I'm your number one. Let's not let him get it out of our sight! Oh, not me, Boss. He's not gonna get by me! Hey, wait. Look. Watch out, Bosco, I'm on your tail! Do you suppose he's.. No, no, no, no, no. Don't be a moron! He's a kid. He doesn't know what that is! Oh, okay. Not like you! You look like a kid! Thanks! You do look like a kid. It's clean living. Ah, oh, it is, isn't it? May I clean liver? Oh, thank you, whoa! It's all right! No need for apologies. I'll walk from here. Bosco? So what were you doing in the woods? Running away. Why, I mean, you've got everything. You're rich. You wouldn't understand. Look, you know these woods, right? Yeah. Well, can you help me get to the other side, I mean, to get to the bus station? Bus station, where are you going? Back to Texas to stay with my mom. But could you help me? Please? Sure. What's all this? Just junk Bosco digs up. You wanna know how many holes I've had to refill to keep him from going to the pound? How many? I don't know, but a lot. You know what though? Probably doesn't matter. Looks like I'm moving and I can't take him with me. I know all about that. About what? About moving. We do it every couple of years. Every time Ultra-Mart moves to a new city and they build, well, they send my dad to over see the transition. And all the people living there hate us for it because they think we're taking over. It's just not true. Well, aren't you? I'm not doing anything. Just try to live a normal life, just be a normal kid. So that's why. That's why. Do you surf? Whoa, is that you in the picture? Hey! I'm sorry. Don't worry about it. What is that? Looks like a tree. It's in Spanish. How would you know that? Private school. Figures. He who carries this gold medallion should have the riches of man. From the hidden vantage point of.. Wait, hidden vantage point? A look to the west and you'll find the arms of the earth in the riches of the skeleton's eye. Snakes, huh? You know about this? The legend of the conquistador's gold. Okay, well, supposedly, the conquistadors hid a fortune in these parts about a zillion years ago. They used markings on gold medallions to tell where they hid the treasure, and then, booby-trapped the secret trail to it. But the story is, one conquistador got greedy, ran off with the medallion and kept the location to himself. Poor guy got disoriented by his own curse, fell victim to his own trap, never claimed the gold. But it's out there, somewhere. Sounds like a crock to me. Well, believe what you want. You wouldn't be the first skeptic. I mean, no one's actually ever found the trail, much less the gold. Except Colt Black. All right, well, Colt Black was the meanest outlaw in the old west. Started robbing banks in Kansas. Eventually, ended up here in California. He came across the conquistador's remains and the gold medallion. Now, being the adventurer that Colt Black is, he couldn't pass up a challenge, so he goes off looking for the secret gold. But Sheriff Joe Denton, wait, you know who Sheriff Joe Denton is, right? Sorry. Well, okay, Sheriff Joe Denton is like a legendary old west lawman. Anyway, Denton tracks Colt Black somewhere nearby before he could find the gold. The outlaw knew someone would try to, you know, take the gold out from under him, so he shot the medallion into three pieces and buried them all around. So Denton put him behind bars, but eventually, Colt Black busted out, went searching for the medallion. Did he find it? Legend is that he found one piece, but couldn't find the others. Went searching for the gold anyway, never heard from again. And this is one of the pieces? Sure looks like it. You're going to go after that gold, aren't you? You told me you'd take me to the bus station. Well, that'll have to wait. If I can find that treasure, I could save my house and my dog. Look, what if this piece of medallion leads you to other clues? What if you find Colt Black and you find the other piece of the medallion? Well then, I'll be that much closer to finding the treasure. This is in Spanish. How are you gonna decipher these clues without me? Are you my Spanish teacher now? Huh? No. I'm you compadre. Compadre? What is that, my sidekick? Not exactly. Look, I don't need a sidekick. What do you call him? Bosco? Yeah. He's my partner. Well then, now you've got two. Look, no offense.. Ugh, has anyone ever said "No offense" without it really being offensive, Josh? Look, all I know is that this journey is gonna test a man's resolve. What? Is this about me being a girl? No, I didn't mean it like that. Good, because I don't know if you know it or not, but this is not the old west anymore. Come on, Bosco. Now, rumor has it that Colt Black's ghost returns daily in search for the gold. Stop trying to spook me out. Hey, I'm just telling you what I heard. Somewhere, back in these woods, there's a snake pit. Or at least there used to be. Older kids used to come here at night, scare their girlfriends into their arms, that kinda thing. Don't get any ideas. There's a trail around here that leads to it. Where was it? Where was it? Oh yeah, this way. Wait up! So what if we find the snake pit? Then what? I guess we'll find the hidden vantage point, look west, find the arms of the earth in the skeleton's eye. Let's do it. Is that okay with you? Yeah. Ah, what you please cut that bland stuff out! Ah, thank you! Professor. I said no napping on the job! No napping! Thanks, I needed that. So, that dog.. Bosco. He's kinda mangy. That's called character. Well, I guess you both got it then. Thanks. Sure. Hey. Look, I don't think you should be calling someone like me a character, putting stink on a word like that when your only friend in town is Rachel. She is not my friend. And sorry about your skateboard. No big deal. She does it every couple of days. Her way of making sure everyone knows who's boss. It'll be sitting in my front yard in the morning probably. Yeah, this is one strange town. You could say that again. Bosco, come here. Why'd I bring you along for again? The scintillating conversation? Where'd you get those big words? TV. Ha, figures. Professor? Professor? Where'd you wander off to now? What are you fooling around for? This ain't the time! We got work to do! Come on! Jeez! It's gotta be around here somewhere. Look, rocks! Well, it's just called Snake Rock, right, I mean, there's no actual snake? Why? Are you scared? No. Terrified. I know they're around here somewhere. Whoa, what was that? We need that piece of medallion to find.. Come on! What are you doing? This is private property. When my dad finds out I'm here, I'm grounded for life. Come on! Yes, yes, Professor, I think that's them. Let's go! Come on! Get them, go on, go on! Right here, right here. What are we doing? Where are those blasted kids? I could've sworn I heard them yapping. They're not here. Not there, not over there either. Shut up, come on, let's go. How could you let them get outta your sight? I thought you were watching them. I thought.. Stop thinking. Start looking. Okay, from now on, I'm not thinking. Starting right this instant, I am looking and definitely not thinking. Just watch while I don't think. Watch me, do you hear? I'm not thinking. I think they're gone. Yeah, they're gone. I recognize those voices. Josh, maybe this wasn't such a good idea. I mean, who knows what kind of creatures are lurking around here, and we don't even know what we're looking for here. And what about those guys, just chasing after... What are you looking at? Sh, sh. Look. Oh my, it's a rock. Look, look closer. Okay, just got goosebumps. Exactly. Come on! Oh my gosh. A real treasure chest! We're gonna be heroes, Ana! We're gonna save the whole town with this chest! How do we get to it though? Yeah, they're pretty sharp. I have an idea. Almost there. Just a little farther. Don't let go. Great idea, Peters! Pull! It's no use, it's stuck on something. Wait, wait, wait, wait a second. It's empty! Wait, there's something in there! All right. Pull me up! I can't! Ana, it's either you pull me up right now or I get turned into shish kabob. Cool. Awesome. What's this? Wow. Ana, you might wanna take a look at this. Ana, look at it. Oh my... I can't believe it. People have been searching for this for centuries, Ana, for centuries! And we just found it! So what does all this say? Well, we're here, so that says snake rock. And over here? Uh, um, he who enters this forest is cursed. Over here, skeleton's eye, the entrance. And? Death valley. All right. And, uh, what's this? Rich as a man. All right, and we have to go here, so that means we have to go that way. And lucky for us, that's the same direction as the bus station. Wow. Josh, wait. What? What is it? Don't you think you should tell somebody about this first? What do you mean we? I thought you were running away. I mean, like, after you take me to the other side of the woods. Don't you think you should tell your dad or somebody? Ana, remember? I showed my dad the medallion, he didn't believe me. I'll show him the map and he'd still won't believe me. Just come on. What is it now? What about those bad guys who are chasing after us? I'll take my chances. Saving my house and Bosco is more important than anything else right now. And finding that treasure is the only way of making that happen. Come on. Yup, west is that way. Let's see. He who enters this forest will be cursed. Joy. What? Well, you see, the bus station's that way. If you're bent on running away, that's where you gotta go. Can we make it quick? I wanna be home before dark. Maybe I don't wanna run away anymore. Maybe I wanna help you find that gold. Why, I mean, you've got money. Forget it, look, I'm along for the ride. Nothing you can do about it. Yeah. All right. Yeah. Good idea. Do you know how many animals, how many fish, have probably peed in this water? If we're out here any longer, I might end up peeing in it. Oh, jeez. Disgusting. Ain't it though? Don't say anything. What would I say? I just figured I better take a drink before you foul it up, that's all. I said I might pee in it, not that I would pee in it. What was that? I don't know. There are a lot of twigs around here, Boss. I'm not stepping on them on purpose. Well, could you try a little harder. You don't see me stepping on a twig! Follow me, fast. Ana, look out! Ana, you okay? What is that? I don't know, but that's been waiting for someone for over 500 years. Whoa. You know what this means, don't you? That we're in a world full of danger? Means it's true, see? Traps in the woods protect the gold? This proves it, that trap right there. Josh, who's following us? Those creeps who tried to buy, steal, the medallion off of me. You really think they're following us? Yeah, I do. Come on. You know what? I said no, Mr. James. Whatever, it's fine. Keep it. Looks great. My daughter, Ana, she ran away. You know what, she's probably just out exploring, you know, she's a little kid. Well, sure, but she left a note, a very teary, smeary "Dad, I'm running away" note. 13 year old girl's leaving me, just like her mother did. Sorry. No, listen, kids get emotional, okay? They do silly things like this. She'll be back, she'll be.. Can you help me find her? Why would you ask me? You're the only one who'd talk to me. All right. All right. Mike Denton, the Sheriff. Mike Denton? He probably... Hey. What? I haven't seen my son Josh. He always makes it home by lunch, you know? And you don't think the two of them are off there out in the woods? Hey Josh, maybe we should go back, you know, and just talked to my dad.. Hold up. An hour ago, you were running away. Now you wanna run back to daddy? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Well, maybe you should. Why do you think I'm traipsing through the woods with you, huh? I don't need the money. But if I can be a part of something that takes the sting off and helps you save your house and helps the town rebuild without having to take its anger out on me and my father.. Maybe you won't feel like such an outsider? Something like that. Hey. Where's Bosco? Bosco! Bosco! Bosco, where are you, boy? Come here, Bosco! Bosco! Where do you think he went? Who knows? But it's not good. I can't believe we lost them, you numbskull! I don't believe I'm tired of calling you a numbskull. Never thought that day would come! Oh, Professor, be careful of the booby-traps here. They're terrible! Meanwhile, Professor, we'll find them, being the leader all the time. I wouldn't mind a couple of the kids catching those booby-traps. Professor, perhaps you could take the lead. Professor, I.. Professor, I'm sick of all that, Professor? I asked you to take the lead, but not so quickly! It's okay, Boss! No problem, I have everything in control! Professor. My life is flashing in front of my eyes! Oh, Professor! I'm gonna drown! Boss, save me! Lead, but didn't mean this! Professor, come, Professor, I can pull you. One, two, three! Bosco! The children. Oh, let's go! Oh, come on, Professor! I'll help ya! Give me a hand! Oh! Oh, come on, Professor. Bosco! Bosco! Bosco! The Conquistador's Curse. What? It says that the forest itself is cursed. It'll take your voice and spin it around till you don't know where you are or where you've been. Bosco! Bosco, I'm coming to you, boy! Give me another bark! Bosco! Bosco, where are you? Come back to me, boy! Just settle down. Get yourself calm. Get your bearings. Listen to me! Wanna know what I'm gonna do if we do get the.. Josh, we gotta run! I'll buy me a nice pair of gold-plated boots. Come on, let's go climb up this tree. Man. Quick, hold that. Is this really the time? Just go along with it. Can you climb a tree? Yeah. Gold-plated boots? Yeah. How are you gonna walk around in metal boots? I didn't say metal boots. I said gold. You know what you oughta buy? What? Some new parts for your brain! What are you doing? The higher I am, the more I can see. Whoa! You hear something? Yeah. Dog barking. Besides that. Beside what? Besides the dog barking. There's something beside the dog? Oh, gosh! Do you hear anything besides the dog? No! Must be your imagination. Must be. Wade, we have got to find the dog. If we find the dog, then we find the kids. If we find the kids, we find the medallion. And if we find the medallion, we find the treasure. Thanks. Does your daughter have a tendency to run off like this, Mr. James? She gets all bent outta shape whenever we change towns, but nothing like this. Well, how about Josh? He's never run off like this? No, no, I mean, he runs around all morning during the summer time, but he always makes it home by lunch. You know where he goes? Not really. I know where he goes. Rachel, what are you doing here? You're looking for Josh and Ana, right, Dad? Well, I know where Josh hides out. Where? In the woods, halfway to Colt Black's Ridge. Colt, what is that? No, no, don't worry. They wouldn't venture too far in there. All the parents make sure the kids think that place is cursed, so they don't go in. There are a lot of rattlers in there. Really, rattlers, okay. She's afraid of snakes. Well, there's a lot of snakes out there. No one's been out to Colt Black Ridge since, well, Colt Black. Those woods are awful big, Rachel. You're gonna need to be more specific. Where would they be? Double my allowance and I'll tell you. Done. Come on. Uh, well... Bosco! Bosco, here, boy! We have to call the hunt off until we find him. He has to be around here somewhere. Bosco? Bosco! Come here, boy! Oh, Bosco, thank god! Whoa! Josh! Oh, Bosco, always digging up junk, man. What, what? Josh, get outta there! What is it? Look. What the? Jeez! Is that who I think it is? If you think that's Colt Black, I'd say you're probably right. And is that what I think it is? I don't know what you think it is, but I know what I think it is. It's almost like he led us here. What are you waiting for? Ladies first. Are you scared? No. Don't be such a baby. You wanna do this? No. You're doing great. Come on. It's not moving! It's not gonna work. It will, just keep trying. Ah, gross! Oh, get it off of me! Oh, oh my gosh! Oh, it's stuck! Help! Get off of me! Stupid! Gah! Ana, look. Yes. Oh, what's this? My days are numbered and they should be. I have searched these woods for gold and have come up empty, the Conquistador's Curse having caught me in its grip. All I can do now is wait for the Devil to take me, knowing that I've wronged many men in my time. Any pity that consumes me, just guilt. As I rest here, a spike torn through me, my thoughts are dreaming basically to those I've hurt. And all I can say is I'm sorry. He felt bad for what he did. Should we find out what the new piece of the medallion says? Yeah. The arms of the earth. Wow, it's beautiful. Ana, you were right. It's a tree! So we find this tree and that should lead us to the skeleton's eye. Yeah, exactly. So the treasure must be somewhere near. The next piece probably tells us where. We probably won't ever find that. You hear something? What was it? Would you please shut that mutt up already? What are you following us for? What do you want? I think you know darn well what I want. Now hand it over! Yeah, hand it over! Can it, Professor! I'm just saying! Yeah, now don't it just fit together beautifully? We got the old legend, yeah, he's coming to life. And we got the two little lovebirds, aw, yeah. We're not.. Yeah, well, can it! I don't wanna hear it! Uh, uh, Boss, uh, um. Boss, I, uh, uh, Boss! Oh! Now hand over that medallion. Yeah. Yeah! Hand it over! We don't even have the whole thing. It's useless. Oh, let us be the judge of that, Missy. Oh, I get it! So sorry! You want it the hard way! That's fine by me. Yeah, that's fine by him. Quiet, moron. Yeah, quiet! I'm talking to you! Oh. You think I got some aversion to slapping a kid around? He's got no aversion of any kind! I don't! Zero! I can testify that, huh? Good. Okay. You can do it two ways! The smart way like me. Or the dumb way like him. I'm not like you. Hey Josh.. I'm not like either of you. Josh, let's just go. These are two grown men. We can't win this fight. Ah, listen to your girl, kid. They won, Josh. Let's just be thankful we're okay and leave them alone. Eh? Eh? It's all yours. Ah! That's what we like, kid. That's a wise choice. Well, ... Oh, what's that? Oh, I tell ya, you have no idea how long the Professor and I have been searching around, and you two kids found it for us. Well, we much appreciate that. So you know what we're gonna do? We're gonna let you leave with your hides. Now scram! My family needs that money! Aw, what a shame. So I think that you will be living in the projects when me and the Professor here are living the high life! Yeah! Living the high life! You know what's gonna be happening to your girl when you're in the projects? Yeah, kid, that's what. She's gonna find a rich guy, a really rich guy, and not need you anymore! Now scram! You bother me! Give me that medallion! Boy, come here, boy! It's mine, it's mine! Josh! Professor, take care of her! Let go of me! Get him off of me! Give it to me! Go get him, Bosco! Get off! Come on! Bite him, boy, bite him! You're trying my patience, kids! Get away from me! Let go! Bosco, go save Ana! Go get her, boy! Come here! Let go of me! I'll take that! Wait, wait! Begone! Bad dog! Come here, kid. Give me that! Give me that, you! (Mumbling) Come on, little girl, now give it to me! Now give me that medallion! Ana, I've got them! Ah, you wanna play? Give me that medallion right now, kid. Don't do it, Josh! It's not yours! It's the girl... Or the medallion. You choose! Huh? See ya. Boss! Now get up! No sleeping on the job! Get up! All right! Come on! Jeez Louise! Am I the only one with brains here? Yes, Sir. I knew you didn't mean to cut me down like that, Boss. Professor, you're about as smart as a bag of doorknobs. Oh! Oh, Boss, flattery will get you everywhere! Of course it will! I like you! Oh, thanks, Boss! Get a hold of it. Take a piece of it! Ain't it beautiful, Professor? So what now? I take you to the bus station, I guess. That's it? That's it. It's over. No gold. No saving my house. No saving my dog. We lost. So that's it, huh? Simple as that? You're just going to give up? Give up on the gold, on your house, on me? I'm not giving up on you. You were going to let me run away, Josh. I didn't want you to. Josh, that gold is out there. You know it and I know it. And you're too strong and I'm too smart to let those two knuckleheads take it away from us. But what can we do? Backpack, please. All right. What exactly are you doing? I'm making a wax impression of the medallion. We have the map. We don't need the medallion. There's writing on the medallion that isn't on the map, so we might need this. Wax impression, that was smart, Ana. Well, I have my moments. Plus, I owed you. For what? Well, when I was near the medallion back there, you chose me. Um, the tree's on the other side of the creek. We have to take the shortcut if we wanna get in front of those guys, you know what I mean? Yeah, let's go. Bosco, come here! Ever hear of the Conquistador's Curse? You mean the one where after the conquistadors conquered the Americas, wiping out everything in their path, accumulating more wealth than you could ever imagine, employed unconventional means with which to protect their treasure, even going so far as to apply local Indian customs and curses in direct defiance of their church and state? Yeah, I heard of it. How would you know that? Because Ultra-Mart researches every town before they conquer it. I mean, colonize it. I mean, cash out. Those aren't pants or trousers. What'd I tell you about those pants. Wait up. We're here, and we have to go there, and then here. Bosco! What are you doing? What? Nothing. Are you trying to show me up at this stage of the game? I'm not trying to show you up. I just wanna get there in a hurry. Is this about me being a girl, 'cause if it is, it shouldn't be.. This again? Oh, ah, joy. Well, because I ran track at my old school. You didn't exactly run with boys, did you? You wanna race? Okay, that's a little bit off-topic, don't you think? Come on, Josh, I'll race you. Forget it. Come on, Bosco. What are you doing? Ready? Ana? Set. And go! Girls. Eat my dust, Josh Peters! Ana! Ana, where are you? I'm down here! Don't look down. Don't look down. Holy, told you! Ana, where are you? Oh, I'm down here! What are you doing down there? Just help me, please! Josh! Ana, you have to grab onto the stick. I can't go any farther. Come on. Come on. You can do it. You can do it. Come on. Thanks. Don't mention it. Hey, have you ever heard the story of the tortoise and the hare? Have you ever heard of the story with the big brown bear in the woods? I think I heard a joke one time that's sorta like that. Yeah, well, I gotta story for you. Okay, once upon a time, there was these idiots with a dog in search of gold and got eaten by a bear. You saw a big brown bear? Yeah. Yeah, let's go.

Bosco! Kids! Boss? Oh, the dog. Got it. Ana! Josh! Ana, kids! You guys need to take a break? I mean, come on, we're on a wild goose chase here. We oughta call in the National Guard. What, you don't think I can handle this? Look, no offense, Sheriff, okay, with truly the best intentions, but if you don't have the resources to mount a proper manhunt, then I think we better call in.. Listen, stop bickering here and just find the kids, all right? We need to work together. All right, all right. Bicker, I mean, come on. I've never seen a badge that small in my life, like a thumbtack's bigger than that at the store. Well, maybe I'll go to Ultra-Mart and buy a big one, yeah. Oh yeah, we can do that, all right, Hoss? Whatever. Ana! Ana! Hey everybody! It's gonna be dark soon. Let's move! What you got there, boy? What's in there? Medallion, please. Let's see here. Looks like this is the tree. I knew you had me along for a reason. Come on. You know what, Ana? You're a genius. Whoa. Josh, be careful! Just don't look down. All right. You see how the sun sets right behind the mountain? Yeah. All right, also, you see how it sets on the map? Yeah. Okay, now can you make out that skull-shaped rock? The skeleton's eye. Exactly. Now, according to the map, the entrance of the cave should be directly below. Oh my gosh, yes! Okay, so we ready? Josh. We're gonna go find the gold. All right, I was just taking a moment. It's been a pretty crazy day. All right. Oh my gosh. What now? I don't know. Wait, can I see the medallion? Yeah. Let's see, he who carries this medallion should have the key to the riches of man. It's the key! It's the key! Put it in, let's see if it works. Check it out, it's huge! Hello? I haven't done that since I was like six. This must be it. This is the water symbol. There's gotta be a clue here somewhere. Let's find it. Ana, stop! What? It's a trap. What? Uh, um, uh, help me find a stick! Whoa! Oh, wow! Are you okay? That was close. Next time, be more careful. What's it say? (Foreign language) What? The gold is cold. Oh. Let's go that way. Definitely. Oh, gosh! Bosco, come back! Watch the traps! Whoa! Bosco, what did you do? Whoa! Okay, um. On three. Okay. One. Two. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. When you say "On three," do you mean like, on three as in one, two, and then three? Or one, two, three, and then we run? On three. On three, okay. Yeah, okay. One. Two. Two. Three! Good job, Bosco! Guys! All right. Looks like they've definitely been here. Yeah? Yeah. All right. All right, here. Give me a hand. Thanks. Rachel, you knew about this place? Josh comes here all the time. It's his little place to think. Yeah, you know any other places he might hide, any other secret spots? Not really. He just likes to dig up stuff. Can we move on and not get all sobby about this and that mangy mutt? Careful. Don't drop me. Whoa, whoa. Ah, man, that's hot! Ah, gosh! What do we do now? Um, okay, I saw this show about this, like, monk, okay? And he had to cross coals like this and he just concentrated, like, really, really hard, you know, mind over matter type of thing, just walked across. Should we try it? Okay. I'm waiting. This type of thing takes time. Just let me focus. We don't have time. Sh. Yep, yep, still hot. Wait, I've got an idea. What? (Foreign language) The gold is cold. The gold stones! Follow me. Be careful. Thanks. Be careful, Ana. Watch it, watch it. Okay. Okay, good job, okay, keep it, be careful, Ana. Oh man. Just jump, just jump. Just jump! Okay. Okay. Okay, you can do it. Just follow my pattern. Okay, okay. You can do it, you can do it. It's okay. Ah. Oh, you're leaning on the wrong foot. Okay. I'm sorry. Hurry up. Don't pressure me. It's the entrance. Whoa. Come on, just over. Leave your backpacks. Okay. Come on, Ana, come on. Holy shining pile of gold! Shining pile of gold! Oh my gosh, I can't believe it! We found it, Ana! Look at all this! You can save your whole town! We are rich! Woo! Aw yeah! Oh my gosh! Woo! I cannot believe this! Yes, finally, look at all this gold, Ana! Jewelry! You're a rich dog now, Bosco! Woo-hoo! Oh my gosh. Your lady. Oh my gosh. This is incredible! Woo! Woo, look at all this gold mess! Put it down, boy! Ah, I said put it down! This? Yeah, that's right, boy. All right. You just put it down. All right, all right. You guys keep showing up! Yeah, they miss us! They do miss us! We've got a fortune here. We can share. I mean, seriously, look at how much there is here. Yeah, well, they got a point, Boss. Ah, ha, what are you talking about? Ow! I don't like to share and neither does he! No, no, we don't like to share! Sharing's for mugs! Fine. We'll leave. Yeah, we will. You're not going anywhere! Oh, no, no, no, no, you don't. Oh, we heard that one before, oh yeah! You see, you'll just circle around and come right back here to get my great, great, great granddaddy's gold! Great granddaddy? Great granddaddy? You didn't know it? You see, Colt Black was my kin, so I think that makes me the rightful owner of all this gold! That's the way he sees it! Yeah, that's the way I see it! Actually, Colt Black stole the medallion that led to that gold. It didn't belong to him anyway. Belonged to the conquistadors. So, if anything.. If anything, it's hers, because she speaks Spanish. What? Yeah, well, they got a point, Boss. Ah, let it go! Ow! We can keep yakking and yakking all day, but that's not gonna get us anywhere, so why don't you be good little kids and come here and let the Professor and I dispose of ya. Got get them, boy! Huh? Whoa! Ah, ya darn, dirty, mangy mutt! What you gotta say now, old man? Oh, I like your style kid. Oh, sorry. Sorry about that Boss. Can't you see I'm trying to make an impression here! Sorry about that. Ow! Kid, I got a style of my own. En garde! Show him how it's done! Whoa! Whoa! Oh, be careful, Josh! Come on, Boss! Boss, what's the matter with you? Be quiet, you horrible man! Yes! Oh, you can do it, Josh! You can do it! Josh! Now, kid, you're shish kabob. Ay-yi, Boss! Come on, Ana, run! Where are we going? Come on, let's go, let's go! Right now, let's go! Come on, Ana! Aw, a dead end! Hey, Boss, I got them! You mutt! Come on, Ana, grab a sword and shield! Look, Boss! Bring it on! Oh, look at them! Throw some stuff at them! That's it! Hey, Boss, isn't this kinda like throwing money at a problem? Oh no, this is too good. Hey Josh? Yeah? I'm glad I met you. Well, I'm glad I met you too, but to be honest with you, this isn't the time for this. Oh, that's what I want! There you go! They're going back! We did it! We did it! Victory! I got an idea. Whoa! Hey, take this for a nice shot. What now? Um, we run! Whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you doing napping on the job? Where'd they go? Not again! Come on. Here we go! Come on, come on! Come on, Boss! Come on, Professor! Lost the kid! Come on, come on, I see a light! Spiderwebs. Bosco, where you going, boy? Ana! Kids! Bosco! Bosco! Come on! Come here, come on! Come here, come here. Come on, where's Josh? Come on, Professor. Hey Bosco, where's Josh, huh? Dad! Josh! Dad! Josh! Dad! Ana! Dad! Hey. Dad! Ana. Ana! Dad! These guys, they're after us! Dad, you won't believe. These treasures. What do you mean treasure? Right below us in the cave! Wait, what, what, who are you? We can take about anything! All right there, boys. Wade Black? Sheriff Denton? Do you have a clean shower in your jail by any chance? Got a nice shower for ya. Yep, get you all cleaned up in jail and then some. Ah, lovely, lovely. You have the right to remain silent. Hold on, Darling. I'll take care of this. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you against you in the court of law. You have the right to an attorney. Do you have a breakfast? Maybe some pancakes and some Froot Loops. Let's go, silent, I said silent. What part of silent don't you understand? I can't believe it! It was beneath our feet all along. What was? This. The gold, it's true, it's all true, in the cave beneath the woods. Dad, there's so much, anything you could ever imagine. There's enough to save the town and then some. Yeah, and enough that no one has to sell their business. Ultra-Mart and the other local businesses can all stay here together. They can all prosper. Yeah, well, we have some good news too 'cause we came up with an agreement, Hector and I. Ultra-Mart's gonna change some policy whereby we're not gonna carry products that you can find locally. They're gonna buy a percentage of some of the local shops and then we can all spend that extra money at Ultra-Mart, so everybody wins. So we didn't have to go out, find you all that? Ooh, I don't know. I think the world could find a way to put this to good use, don't you? So, Josh, what are we gonna do tomorrow? I say we go see what Bosco digs up. You're the treasure, princess. Thanks Dad. Oh, I'm so glad you're safe. I'm proud of you.
