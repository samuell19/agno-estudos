Do you know who it is? It's probably one of the guys... from the sex scandal articles The justice system will take care of them I'll just go away and finish writing that novel What if he really comes after you? Have you decided where to go? No, I'm still thinking. You ought to go to Bang Bae. Our new house is empty. I bought it about a year ago. It's too big. We'll move in there when Young-Ju gets a little bigger. It's well-furnished, I think you will love it What do you think? Thanks a lot. Ho Jung, is that okay? Honey, do you think it's okay to be alone there? It's dangerous. It's not dangerous. I've had a security system installed. But I'm still worried. This is great. I'm sorry. I should stay with you but Young-Ju's asleep. Will you be okay? Aren't you scared? I'm not a little kid. Don't worry, I'll be fine I'm just worried. Which room should I use? Use my bedroom. It's the most comfortable. It's so big. I'm a little uneasy. And it's for you and your husband. I'll take the room at the end of the hall upstairs. That room? No, it's full of junk. It's a storage room. I'll clean it up. You guys go and get some rest. Ok, I'll lock up. I'll call you tomorrow. He doesn't quit. Now what is it? Now what? What's this? That's weird. That's never happened before. What? It only gives one number. Hello? You drive well. I'm sorry. You'll need to go to another branch. I think it's fate. Just give me that number. The girl in the picture is Modigliani's daughter. He painted it when his wife was pregnant. He painted it after watching. Thinking about their unborn daughter. They must have been happy. I want... Young-Ju to grow up like that... in a perfect family. You ought to paint again. You have the perfect family. You're wasting your talent. I don't think I could take care of the family and paint right now. I'm satisfied just enjoying other's art. Sorry about that. Is it him again? No. Since I changed my cell number I shouldn't get any more those calls. What's the number? This is Renoir's Irene Cahen d'Anvers. Young-Ju! Young-Ju. Give us the phone. Give me the phone! Young-Ju! Young-Ju! Give us the phone. Give me the phone! Young-Ju! Young-Ju! Give me the phone! Young-Ju! Young-Ju! You're worried, aren't you? Whatever she heard on the phone must have scared her. I don't think it was the stalker, but it's weird. Anyway call me if you go to the doctor tomorrow. Sure I will... Stop it. It hurts my ears. There doesn't seem to be anything wrong. Is she okay? She's just stressed from whatever scared her. Give her some time. She'll be fine. Since you changed your number you've had two calls. Your friend Ho Jung and me. That's not right. I've had three strange calls since then. There are two possibilities: the phone company's records are messed up... or the stalker knows... how to block the calls from showing up Those sex scandal guys. will be on trial in a few days. It's probably one of them. But be careful. Here's a present. You really think this is going to help? Hit them once and they're out. The men involved in the underage sex scandal have been identified. It's shocking that one of them Dr. Cha, is a psychiatrist. A Miss Jung has testified that Dr. Cha... repeatedly demanded perverted sex. Hello. So, who the hell are you? Hello? What do you mean? Slow down now. What are you going to tell? You're going to catch a cold. Studying is hard, isn't it? A faint rose smell. I love that faint flower fragrance. Now, which way? I love you more than anything. If you're hurting then I hurt too. So don't be hurting anymore, okay? You're such a strong woman I thought you'd give up... when the doctor said you couldn't get pregnant. But with that artificial insemination program you did it. When I think of that time I still feel faint. Do you know how nervous I get... watching you go from crisis to crisis? What would I do without you? I couldn't have done it without you. - Young-Ju! - Daddy, I'm scared Ji-Won! What do you think she heard? I was so scared. It started after... she answered my phone in the museum, didn't it? I checked the phone records but there's nothing there Ji-Won How about changing your number again? Then he can't call Hello? Hey, Chang-Hoon! What's up? Yeah, just a minute. It's Chang-Hoon Hi, honey. You're getting big. Young-Ju, do you remember what you heard on my phone? No. Aunt! Do you know what love is? Love? Do you know love? No, you wouldn't know... what real love is. You're in love with somebody... Who is it? Daddy So, you said you love your Daddy What about your Mommy? Do you love her? Don't you love your mommy? You're tired. Go to sleep. Aunt! If... that woman calls again tell her not to yell, it scares me. You don't look good. Is it the phone calls? Did you find anything? There is no record of a call coming in on your cell at that time Even the department at a phone company tracking the calls has no idea. Are we at a dead end? This is what I've found. People who've had that number. Nothing strange in their background. But you know... both people that had that number died. One in a car wreck, the other had a heart attack. It's not necessarily murder... but it is strange. Finish eating and let's make Daddy a card. I've got everything ready. A Christmas card? Yeah. - Who is it? - Flower Delivery. What is it? Daddy sent them. Sorry for not helping out lately. I love you! Eat it. I said eat it! Eat it. Young-Ju, what's the matter? Nothing. Young-Ju? What's wrong with you? He worked hard driving his taxi and... he talked about his dream of opening a restaurant. Then his wife bought that cell phone. I don't know if it was the phone that killed him The cell phone? He said that after he got the cell phone he started getting weird calls. Nobody talking! Just a bone chilling sound! It was like his soul was gone. One day, he said he wouldn't do night duty. I asked him why and he said something about a ghost. What caused the wreck? Here it is. Bang Bae? Ho Jung! What's going on? She has an unusually strong desire to be with her father. The long hair represents her... as an adult thinking sexually of her father. She gets jealous when you and your husband get intimate... and she doesn't want to leave her Dad. Is she trying to push me away? At her age it's just a temporary thing You mean there is anything else wrong with her? No Developmentally and health-wise she's fine. You have a very intelligent little girl. Let's do it again. Se-se-se... Wouldn't it be great if I was on TV, if I was on TV? Anyway she lived alone. Before she died you should have seen her face. You know, it was ghostly white. Was it suicide? Who commits suicide in an elevator? They said it was a heart attack caused by some mental fit. She asked me to call when they got a trial date. Is she already asleep? What's this? Hey? Are you okay? One winter day, a certain queen was sewing by the window. Then the queen pricked her finger with her needle. Three drops of blood fell into the snow. The red on the white looked so beautiful, that she thought... "If only I had a child as white as snow, as red as blood..." and as black as this frame... ...and they lived happily ever after Yeah, right! Shit! We grow up with this crap that's why... we have little stupid princesses around. What a stupid story! Detective? Get away, he needs surgery! I told you not to mess with me. You started all this. You're crazy. How does it feel to be hanging by a thread? Beg me to save you. What's the matter? Why's the fridge open? You're going to make yourself sick. Stop worrying. The doctor said she'd be fine. Let's wait a while. If she gets worse we can admit her. I don't want her admitted. I'm sorry. My little princess is awake. Give me a kiss. Young-Ju! Young-Ju? Young-Ju What's wrong with you? Young-Ju? Young-Ju What are you doing? Hi! You're good on the piano. You are already on the Moonlight Sonata? The Moonlight sonata? That song you play every night. My Mom doesn't let me play at night. That's strange! My Mom says the music comes from your house. Anybody home? She had two cell numbers? But there was only one phone. I didn't know it until she was gone. Her number was 9726-6644. When we couldn't find her I cancelled the 9998-6644 number I kept her number to keep hope alive. There were a lot of rumors when Jin-Hee disappeared. She ran away with a boyfriend. She worked at a bar. She was a stripteaser. But one day... they said she got killed... and came back to haunt the school.
