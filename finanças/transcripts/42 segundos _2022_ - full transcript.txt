I'm honoured to announce that the International Olympic Committee, at its plenary session in Lausanne, has attributed the organisation of the twenty-fifth edition of the Olympic Games in 1992 to the city of... Just one moment... To the city of Barcelona, Spain. THE FINAL GAME BASED ON REAL EVENTS BARCELONA 12th OF SEPTEMBER, 1991 I want you up there in ten minutes. I want you up there in ten minutes. Get a move on. Come on, get going! Come on, you're slower than the politicians, damn it. He's doing well, I didn't even vote for him. Pasqual Maragall loves Barcelona. But having the Olympics here... - The idea turns me on. - Yes... Everything does. Imagine all the families out there watching us. - Seeing us win a medal. - Exactly. Know the best thing about the Olympics? It's not the medals or the parade. No... The best thing... are the foreign girls. Come on. To the showers with you. I want to go home. Well, we sure seem happy, don't we? Can you tell me why? Because I don't... We're hardly going to cry. I mean... We were cold... And why is that? Maybe because we didn't warm up? You tell me. You're the coach, you studied these things. Let's not make a scene, Josep. Why were the Greeks warming up while our guys were on the bench? I told them to warm up but it's just a friendly, no big deal. Why are you laughing and joking when you just lost against a team worse than you? Look, I haven't fired you yet as there's no other coach who wants to take this team to the Games. Josep, we've just got back from holidays. - Don't exaggerate. - Me? Know what Dragan said when I offered him the post? "Being ridiculed at the Olympics is worse than not going". You offered him my post? Popović accepted the offer. How do you know? - What offer? - The Italian team. How do you know? - A journalist told me. What is it? Popović is Serbian and Dragan, Croatian. - So what? - They're at war, idiot. I need to call Croatia. If Dragan hates Serbia that much... - Croatia? Why? - No, hang on, Josep. You're kidding, right? That guy's crazy. - I've heard messed-up things... - Wasn't he an army sergeant? - Yes. - That's right. It's just what we need. Josep! Josep! I'm not thrilled about Dragan, but we must do something. See that? Over there. Two skyscrapers, 154 metres high. The Olympic village, a whole new neighbourhood created for these Games. As well as stadiums, parks... Know why we're doing it? To welcome the world. In just five years, Barcelona will have modernised as much as it has in 30 years. Carl Lewis and Michael Jordan will walk our streets, media outlets from all over the planet, for those days, will have Barcelona on their TVs, radios and newspapers. These aren't just any old Olympics, Manel. It's a baptism of fire for us all. My lunch is ready. I'll drive you. No, we won't look stupid if you coach them. We've got Manel Estiarte. These guys need someone to coach them like the great teams. Forget about it. You'll lose less sleep. Popović accepted the offer from the Italian team. It's going public in under an hour. Spain has technique, but it's missing a lot. These Games will be very hard. Not just because of Italy, Hungary and the United States too. The Federation pushed the boat out, we've got the Andorra facilities. If we start now, we might have enough time. In so few months, reaching the semis would be a miracle let alone the final. Listen, tell me what you want in exchange for coaching my guys and you'll get it. Yes, I swear! I'm being serious. You can save up to 99 telephone numbers. But you only ever call your mum! Why carry it around with you? Call when you get there. - So they can find you. - I'd rather they didn't. Good point. I feel the same! No, listen, it's all the rage because it's this small and so cheap. - Yeah, this small. Hey, how's it going, guys? Come sit with us. - We ordered for you. - I can't stay... Why's that? I just... I came to... We have a new coach. Dragan Matutinović. Here's... These are the pre-selected players. You told us you wanted Dragan, right? Well... That's that, then. We're not delighted, but it's fine. I gave him the right to choose the pre-selected players and... when the time comes, those who will go to the Games. What do you mean? You're not all going. Marc. Pol. You haven't been pre-selected. Dragan is bringing new players from Madrid. They'll join the team when you start training in Andorra. I'm really sorry. ANDORRA 5th OF MARCH, 1992 FOUR MONTHS BEFORE THE OLYMPIC GAMES Fucking Madrilenians. Late on the first day. What a nerve. Well, well... What's up, guys? - Hi. - Hi. Hey. - Hey. - What's up? - Hi, guys. What's up? - Hi? Did you know? - Hi. - Hi, welcome. Congratulations. To those I already know... and those I'll soon meet. - Fuck. - Didn't he injure you? Well... Times of change. I hope we can enjoy this exciting journey together. Something up with your eyes? They're prescription, I've lost the others. I want to say that I fully trust each and every one of you. No way. They're hungover. And I know you'll give your all for this team. No doubt about that. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. You're not the strongest, or the most technical, or the most intelligent and, above all, not the most disciplined. - We're the most handsome. - Idiot. But I promise you'll be the best trained. I'm not after water polo players, I'm after gladiators. You're the pre-selected players but I'll only keep ten of you. It's the easiest part of my job as I don't have to choose. You do. Over the next few months, you'll live and breathe water polo. You'll go from your rooms to training and from training back to your rooms. If your dad dies, postpone the funeral until after the Games. If you need to see your girlfriends, ask a mate for a hand job. It might teach you something about team work. Before the first training camp is over, ten of you will have left of your own accord. The one thing you won't choose is the new captain. The captain's hat is free as of today. Whoever wants it must prove they have the head for it. - Challenge accepted. - You, captain? It's a chick magnet, you know? You're an idiot. Nobody rests on their laurels with me. Antonello, Bovo, Campagnolo, Di Francesco, Piero, Fabio, Giovanni, Aurelio, Basilio, Leonardo and Filippo. And Filippo. What do they have in common? It's the team Igor Popović has chosen for the Olympics. The Italian team, I mean. - Tell me something I don't know. - Well... None of them are shorter than 6'2". And our average is...? - Just over 6 feet. - And we weigh...? An average of 192 pounds. And them? - Around 198. - So, they're... Taller? And we're...? Shorter? Weaker! Who the fuck are you? He's Joan, your assistant. That means that if we have to face them they'll tear us apart. Sergi Boix, Albosc, Pedro García, Javi Franco, Miguel Bobes, Manel Estiarte and Jesús Rollán. You're the starters for tomorrow's friendly. What? Against Italy? For now, one that's on your level. The team from Andorra. They have a team? Sorry, sorry. Get some rest. You're going to need it. Come on. Ready? Let's go! You follow us. Maybe that will wake you up. What? You're joking, right? Hey, Joan! I didn't know! - Joan! - It's freezing. No... - Do we have to run? - No way. Fuck... half an hour after we go to bed, I hear a scream. He was so wasted, instead of going to the bathroom, he went into my parents' room and threw up on their feet! No way, no way... - Come on... - No way, mate! I got the wrong room! So, what happened? Did you take some? - Well... - I didn't. They offered me a little line... so I took it. How polite! How the hell did you pass the check, then? Water. Ten pints to be exact. I thought it didn't work, but it does. As easy as that? Ten pints, you're negative? No. You're void. The result is void so they have to repeat it. But that earns you time. See you in a bit. Where are you going? Estiarte! How's it going? I'm Toto, pleased to meet you. Welcome, Pedro. I saw you play in the Italian league and you're not bad. I've been team captain since I was 15. I'm not bad, no. What a clown. I've got almost everything you asked for. Diving lead belts, VHS of the last 100 games of the United States, Hungary, Italy and all the rest, but... it says "gum" here. Strawberry or mint? - Never! Melon. Ten. Ah, okay. Coach, it's truly a pleasure... - Don't call me coach. You're not working for the Cleveland Guardians. Ah, okay. Go back to your seat. Yes. Let him shoot! Hey! He can shoot! - Shoot! What the fuck? Block! Don't let him! What are they at? - Let him shoot! - Move! Don't let him shoot! Open the arch! Fuck! Move! Give him a clean shot! What are you doing? We have the best keeper ever! Come on! Here, Toto! Here! Come on! Keep going! - There! Go, Manel! - Go, Manel! Together, come on! Together! Focus, focus! Come on! He's alone! - There! - Pressure! - Follow him! He can't shoot! Drop the ball and go home, okay? Wasn't your six-month injury enough? Want another six? - What's going on? Pau, ignore him! Ignore him. Javi! Stop! What the fuck? Stay out of it. - His business is my business. I'll break your face, asshole. Take that Catalan sausage out of your mouth first. You're allowing this? - Get involved, you're out! - What the fuck? Stop, Javi! You'll let them fight? We need to break this up! Sir! Pau! Pau! Stop it! Get out! - Pau! Stop it! - Stop it now, mate! Pau! Get out! Javi! Javi! Are you animals, or what? Enough embarrassment for today. Dendrites are protoplasmic extensions, short ones, of the neuron mainly involved with receiving stimuli and also cellular feeding. - Did I wake you? - No. Well, yes. But don't worry. - Sorry. What is that? Serrat. Are you okay? Yes, why? I thought you were worried about the Madrilenians. No. They should be worried. It's their problem if they can't fit in. Good night. Fifty-one, fifty-two... - Keep going until he gets here. - Fifty-three, fifty-four, fifty-five, fifty-six, fifty-seven, fifty-eight, fifty-nine... Fuck. Well! Sorry, is this the water polo pool? What do you think? Right... How are you? Good? Your technique is impeccable. Me? I'm fine. Yes... I think you'll get silver. Sorry, is something wrong? We connected, you can't deny it. - Connected? - Yes, you looked at me in a really intense way. Like this. - With that face? - Yes. I probably forgot my contacts. I'm short-sighted. That must be it. - What's your name? - Pedro. Going to watch me train all morning? I'd love to, but I can't. Shame. What's your name? - Sara. - You look like you're from Madrid... If I guess your training club, dinner's on you. La Latina. It's a gift... - You were with San Blas, right? - How do you know? Those guys used to watch us like they were obsessed. Wankers. It's just twice a day now. When's our dinner? We'll discuss it later. It's a shame you have to go. I'll see you again, right? Probably. You seem pretty annoying. I am. I'm really, really annoying. You were right. This isn't the water polo pool. - I told you. - Yes. Ciao. Sorry. Good morning. Have a good session. Ciao, Sara! Two hundred and thirty-one, two hundred and thirty-two, two hundred and thirty-three... Sorry! Sorry, sorry, sorry! Sorry, guys. If I'd known it was glutes day, I'd have come earlier. Like the countryside? You can thank Pedro. Get your baskets. We're off for a picnic. That's not on, mate. Thanks a bunch... - It's not a big deal. - Yeah, right. Come on. Fuck. Pleased with yourself? We've done 13 miles. We play a water sport! Come on. What's that you've got there? Who hit you in the face? Hey, ignore that jerk, he's weak as fuck. A punch from me, he'll have a nose like Cobi. Asshole. No fucking way... Where are you going? No, come on. Fuck... No fucking way. No way, mate. Turn around! Stop! That's enough for today. But not for you, and you. This makes no fucking sense, they're drowning. If he wants to get rid of one, just kick him out. He doesn't eliminate us. We have to give up. Come on, Javi! Go! Come on! Go on, Pau! - Go on, Pau! Go! - Go on, Pau! Go! Go, Pau! Come on! Go, go, go! Let's go! Go! - Go! - Come on, go! Don't stop, Pau! Go, go, go! You can do it, Javi! - Go! - Hang in there! Come on! Let's do this! - That's it! - Go, Pau! You can do it! - Go, go, go! - Let's go! Let's go, guys! - Go on! - Go on, Pau! You can do it, guys! Come on! Last one! Hang on, hang on, Pau! Pau, Pau, Pau! No! Stop! Joan! Joan! Pack your bags. Mum... It's been ages! Yes, but... I've been busy. How are you? - Fine. How are you? How's it going at la Canoe? Well, I'm not in Madrid, that's what I wanted to say, I've got some good news. Can you put Dad on? We're about to have dinner. But this is important, Mum. Well, you know what Dad's like. Tell him to come, please. Why don't you call back another time, okay? Okay. Give him a kiss from me. Come and see us soon. And one for you. Kisses. Ciao. Running away? Hi. Your sergeant installed security cameras. Come on, we all know that a Catalan invented that so we go to bed early. Where are you going? I can't sleep, I thought a run might help. Can't sleep either? Nope. I don't know why. The moon? We could go together, see who has the best pace. I don't want to be seen with you. You have a bad reputation. I get it, okay? You're a good girl, right? - Am I? - I don't know, I'm asking you. - I don't know. - Yes. You think so? - From zero to four, a three. - Of being a good girl? - Yes. - Really? Barcelona is on fire. Nobody's talking about anything but the Olympics. We might have a chance this year in disciplines like cycling or athletics. The Spanish football team also has its sights on the gold medal. However, the water polo team has accumulated a lot of injuries. We hope the coach's strategy of bringing new players from Madrid works out well because they're up against it with the favourites, Italy, and their top player: Filippo. ANDORRA 26th OF JUNE, 1992 A MONTH UNTIL THE OLYMPIC GAMES Good morning! Good morning. So you're an early riser, too? Yes, I am. I love the morning. I really do... Enjoy your breakfast. Fuck. Just one left to go. No shit. You don't say. This guy's crazy. We won't make it back alive. Are you okay, Juli? I want nobody weak on the team! If you can't take it seriously, you can stop running. Juli! - Manel! - Toto! - He's down. - Manel. It's Juli. - Toto! Guys! We'll be right back. And congratulations, you're the chosen ones. See you at the top. Hey, stop, stop. How are you doing? Good, fine. Do your feet hurt? It's nothing. Come on, get in. What? Don't make me say it again. You know this team needs you in one piece. And the others? We'll see them at the top. I don't want a lame captain. I have to tell you something for the sake of the team. - Useless, mate. - Terrible. I'm knackered. Me too. Javi. Here. You haven't got a fucking clue. Taxi Driver is on. What time? - 10:30 p.m. Shall we watch it? - Yes. - Terrible... - Shoot. - Where do you want it? - Here. Hey, hey. Say goodbye to Andorra. We're going home. You're still not the strongest, you're still not the most technical or the most intelligent. But at least, now, you're ready up here. From tomorrow onwards, if they want to beat us, they'll have to really try. And, before I go, I have two pieces of news. The first is that Manel is your new captain. - Nobody voted here. - Nobody votes here except me. And he won by an absolute majority. If that's what it takes to be captain, congratulations. If you liked that piece of news, you'll love this one. Your captain and I took a little drive to the summit and he told me that you've been running off to go out partying. And, what's more, you take cocaine. Fucking hell, some captain... Hey! Is it true? Is it true? I go out sometimes. And the cocaine? You say it like I have a problem. You know that when we go back to Barcelona the Olympic Committee will check every official team and do random checks too? Yes. Know what happens if a player tests positive? Yes. Can you say it out loud, please? So that we all know you're aware of it. - They eliminate us. - Yes. All of us. Him, him, him... We're all eliminated because you decided that it's more important to party for a bit longer. I should kick you off the team. I won't leave the Olympic Games in the hands of a fucking junkie. I can control it. I don't have to take it. The problem is you're as stupid as you are necessary in this team. But... I can't trust you. So I'll pass it on to the only person in this room who, as we've all seen, is capable of ratting you out. You'll share a room. What? Pedro takes drugs, Manel squeals. Pedro parties, Manel squeals. And, if it happens, it will be both of your faults. If the Federation gets wind of this... we're in big trouble. It's not fair. I don't care what you think. Who the fuck brought you up? Don't touch me! Get off me! Don't touch me! If you have something to say, say it to my face. - I don't have to... - Fucking hit me! Fucking hit me! We're not in the playground. We're the national team. Get that into your head. - Fuck you. A team, a team...? Fuck you! I did what I had to do. You said they should try to fit in. Well, you're wrong. You know that we need them and it's not just a phase. You should be happy, we're better with them. With a junkie? He's stronger than us even when he's knackered. - Water polo isn't just strength. - Exactly. It's also technique and brains, we've got it. Dragan brought us together for a reason. If we play together, we'll be the shit. 25th of July, 1992. Today is one of the most important days for the city of Barcelona. Welcome to the inauguration ceremony of the Barcelona '92 Olympic Games. We're so excited to be here. The city is full of athletes from all over the world. They've given their all for many years to get here. In Brazil, we're really excited to be here for this big moment. We're all ready to light the Olympic flame. Where, very soon, we'll find out which of these young athletes will be able to make their dreams of gold come true. - Dinner's in two hours. - Great. I'm sleeping here. Why? I can't sleep by the window. Incredible. Why? I'm the captain, do as I say. Very well, captain. I'm sleeping here. The Olympic Games have started...! Let's go! SPAIN 12 - 6 THE NETHERLANDS VICTORY FOR THE WATER POLO TEAM 12 - 6, guys! 12 - 6! They didn't see that coming! Great game, guys! - Come on! - Yes, yes! - What a game, mate! - Well played. - Toto. - What? Thanks for getting between us. The bastard almost crushed me. Amazing, mate. Well played. What a game. Pass me the water. Jesús... Good game. Thanks. You next. Carles Pintor, Televisión Española. Winning by 12 to 6 may sound really good, but the truth is that the opponents were weak and Spain played badly. Do you regret combining the old Catalan guard with the new wave from Madrid? No. Next. Rafa Romero, Barcelona Radio. Do you think this team is ready to beat the United States or a team like the Italian one? Yes. Can you tell us why? If I didn't think so, I'd be on the beach and not here answering obvious questions. María José García, Radio Nacional. What do you think of Italy's game and coach, Igor Popović? Italy is a great team. He's Serbian. - Eh... - Yes. You're Croatian. - Maybe we should... - No. Yes. Your countries are at war. Does that make you even greater rivals? I think that Italy has wasted some good players by giving them a useless coach. Did you say the Serbian coach is useless? I don't think he'll mind. He does it himself whenever he opens his mouth. - Dragan! Please, could...? - No more questions, thank you. Sunday, 2nd of August. Spain faces Greece in their second game of the preliminary phase. Will the winning streak continue? Yes! SPAIN 11 - 6 GREECE Against all odds, Spain has done it again. Dragan Matutinović's team seems in better shape than ever. Third day of the water polo. Spain faces Hungry today, the team with the most Olympic gold medals in the world. Today's game couldn't have been better. The Spanish team surprised everyone, thrashed expectations, and shut people up. But we mustn't forget that, today, both the United States and Italy are still favourites. - What are you doing? - Huh? You heard. Looking for my boxers, I don't know... Probably with your clothes. You're right. Let's try to be on time for once. Spain is optimistic on this last day of the first round, but there are no guarantees. To reach the semifinals, one thing's for sure, they must win against the mighty Cuba, as difficult to beat as ever. Look, the water polo. A NARROW WIN PUTS SPAIN IN THE SEMIFINALS Good game! You were fucking incredible today! Yes, yes! Fucking hell! Assholes! SPAIN UNITED STATES ITALY UNIFIED TEAM Manel! No! Hey! What the fuck's up? You won't stop. Fuck. It's so fucking hot... Don't start, don't start, don't start, okay? Don't start. Close the window. I won't. - Close the damn... - No... I'm sick of you and the fucking window, your nightmares, the Walkman! I'm suffocating here! Get dressed. What the fuck? I'm suffocating too. Will you tell me what's up? You have nightmares every night. Why? - Shut up. And that tape? If your tape's going to bug me every night, at least tell me what it is. Your girlfriend? You miss her and...? - It's my sister. So watch your mouth. - Fine. You listen to a tape of your sister. And the window? Do you think that's normal? What's with all the questions? Do I ask you about all the partying? Can't stand being by yourself? Let's go. She recorded her medicine lectures and memorised them for her exams. I didn't know your sister... Her name was Rosa. She was a swimmer. I'm an asshole, mate. If I knew, I wouldn't have... - Don't worry. Anyway, you're right. If my shit's going to bug you, you need to know why. It doesn't bug me now. I don't want to fuck up again... but you're so fucking good. You don't seem to enjoy it. It's not about fun. It's about winning. - No. - It's your job. - No. I get paid to have fun. I don't work, I play. Not being serious in there brings problems. The problems are outside of the water. They disappear in there. My family disappears. My fucking anxiety. I love playing. And so do you. Dragan, if you beat the United States today, will you be happier as Spanish coach or as a Croatian? For me, it would be an honour to take Spain to the final, but... I can't forget that my country is suffering and that the United States, just like the European Community, are to blame. Lots of people are dying in my country because of Serbia. The United States haven't lifted a finger. They only do if they think it will rain oil. My gold will be for all my people. I don't give a shit about their marines, their Air Force One and their shitty hot dogs. They're the first world power. So what? Today, they eat Spanish omelette because I rule in my pool and I order you to take down every single one of them. Get into position. Come on! Last few minutes of the Olympic Games semifinal. Both Spain and the United States have five goals. Who will score the winning goal? At 6'4", Craig Wilson makes anything look easy. It's hardly surprising when, for two years, Wilson has been named the best keeper in the world. And if Wilson was the best keeper of the '80s, I think it's obvious who'll be the best of the '90s: Jesús Rollán! What a goal by Pedro García Aguado in the last second, putting us in the final! Yes! Not many had faith, but the Spanish water polo team is becoming the revelation of these Olympics. Yes! After your magnificent victory against the United States, do you think Spain is favourite for gold? Yes, I'm convinced that the gold is already ours. The Italian coach, Igor Popović, has just announced that he's happy Spain beat the United States, it takes the pressure off them for the final. And he added, I quote: "that the Spanish players are a bunch of has-beens and a few little boys as strong as they are stupid". Any comments? Over the last few months, I've seen these "has-beens" climb mountains bigger than Popović's own arrogance. They've never been in better shape. - That's right. - Did he stand up for us? - Must be a mistake. It gave me goose bumps. I hope that the Italians are ready for a fight because I've never seen guys of this age with more balls in my life. Do you think you'll win gold? - He definitely stood up for us. - Yes. What a man. This is what Filippo had to say. To say we're not the best, wouldn't be modest, it would be a lie. - Idiot! - Fatso! Salami! What? - Salami? It's Italian, right? Hey, look, look. Who's the best? You're as cocky as an Italian. Know that? Call me Totti Aguado. Toto! My folks send their love. Put Mari Carmen on. - He wants to talk. - Mari Carmen. What's up, gorgeous? Jesusito is fine, but I'm better. Hey, when we're free, I'll sell my gold and take you out for seafood. Great, give my love to Pepe. Bye bye. Leave my mum alone, okay? Come on, now. Yes, Mum? Speak soon. Okay, bye. You're a sleaze. - I just love them. You could call yours. What for? Listen. We should celebrate tonight. Knowing Dragan, there won't be a dinner. Let's set one up. Wait for the gold, to celebrate together. Okay. Are you okay? I just can't believe it. The fucking final. - Let's have a beer. Come on. Cheers! We're in the final! Amazing, guys! What are you doing? Nothing. I was going to call you. How are you? Congratulations. And to you. Hey, I was thinking... We could do what we did in Andorra? It was such fun. Thanks, but... I thought we could celebrate the gold that we're going to win. - Right. Thanks, but I'm really tired. - Just a little. A couple of drinks, okay? All this just to leave the village? To do the same, but outside? - What's wrong? - Where's Pedro? Pedro, he's not here. Get dressed, we're going out. No fucking way, Toto. No way. Does Dragan know? Yes. And Jesús? - He's still out looking for him. - Fuck. Now's not the time for this. Do it after training. We're in the final, it would be weird if they didn't. When they see one's missing, we're fucked. He'd better show up, and not in a mess. - You idiot. - What is it? What? - They're doing a check. Fuck. - Go on, Toto. - You'll never believe what happened. Fuck, Toto, mate. I feel fine and terrible too. Fine and terrible at once. Manel. Can you come? He's here. Just got back. I don't believe it. Why are you such an idiot? He's wasted, fuck! Go and check nobody's coming. Quickly. We'll find a solution. - You're off the team. There's the solution. No check for you. - A cold shower. - No, that won't help. - Help me. - One second! - Calm down. - Okay. - Calm down. - Get up. I'm fine, damn it. - Hi. - Don't talk to me. Jesús. Stop looking. Pedro just got back. What? He's in there? - He's wasted. - How is he? He's fucked up. Hang on a second. Don't be long. It's freezing! Fuck, that water's cold! It's too cold, damn it! - Shut up. Let me take my shirt off! Stop it! - Wash your mouth out. - Fuck. - Here, you stink. Go on, go on! I can brush my teeth. - Where are they? - Shit. Water. Ten pints. - Shit. - They're coming. - What? - It voids the analysis. We did it once. Ten pints, they do it again. - Give it here. - Guys, guys! I didn't take drugs, I just drank. - Yeah, right. - Check they're not here. - Get up. - No. Get up, you have to drink. - No. - Drink the water. - How are you, sir? - Hi. Just getting some air. One second. Where is he? - No. - You're off my team! Pedro! Pedro! Open up! - I won't. You have to drink this! If he drinks it, the analysis is void. - Manel, please, help me. I didn't take any drugs! - Drink it or you're out. - Asshole. Manel, please. Manel! Manel, seriously. I didn't take any drugs. - Pedro, listen. What? I believe you. If you say you didn't, I believe you. Don't drink it. - What the fuck? - You heard. - After all this? If not, we'll never know if he's telling the truth. I think he is. I want him to prove it. Manel Estiarte? Yes, that's me. Pedro García Aguado? Where do I pee? It's your turn. I'll get changed. Good morning. - Hello. - Mr Perelló, we have the results. I'm in no mood for speeches. You were negative. I told you I would. You're in the best team, earning money... - I said no speeches. - No, you listen to me. You might win Olympic gold tomorrow. It's every athlete's dream, you didn't go out because it's stressful here. You were clean, so what? Accept that you have a problem. And it's not cocaine, it's avoidance. And what can I do? Think I like being this way? Thank you. For believing I hadn't done it. - I'm surprised you remember... - Well, only after the shower. No more shocks, okay? You were right. I don't enjoy playing. Why? I need to win the gold. I really need it. - That's normal. We all want it. If it hadn't happened, she would have won it. I'd just got back from Italy for the Easter holidays, we were going for lunch at home. We were having a drink on the same old terrace. Me with my friends, her with hers. It was fine. I walked a friend I hadn't seen for ages back to his house and got home later. She was upstairs arguing. My dad was hanging his head, just accepting her shouting... I don't know, I wanted to put things right quickly. I said: "Lunch time, don't do this to our dad". And... as we went down the corridor she was still... angry, complaining. I don't know why, I turned and said to her... "Stop this suffering". "Stop our suffering". She looked at me with an expression I'd never seen. She turned and ran. I ran off after her, she went into her room... jumped on the bed and... out of the window. I couldn't do anything. Tomorrow might be a good day to forgive yourself. Dedicate the game to her. Pay homage to her. Yes. Shall we go? - Yes. Look, look. Look up there. What is it? The footballers. They won gold. Our turn tomorrow. I'd give anything to have already played and won. We'll give it our all. We've trained like beasts. Given our souls in there. It's all in our favour. We're playing at home. The public are behind us because they're our people. Our parents, our friends, our siblings. We're going to win gold. And, above all, we'll be aware of how lucky we are to play an Olympic final. And most importantly: we're going to have fun. Of course we will. Let's win that fucking gold. - Yes. - That's the way. Come on, guys. Let's go! 9th OF AUGUST, 1992 SPAIN - ITALY FINAL This is our home, team. Let's get these pizza-eaters. - Come on, they're ours. - Bunch of wankers. Let's go get the spaghetti! - Come on, they're ours. - Let's go! What are you doing? What's all this? - Come on, they're wankers! - We'll eat them for breakfast! - Come on, team! - Yes! We're ready at Picornell for the Spain vs. Italy final, right now, the two best teams in the world. We have about two minutes before we kick off the most important game in the history of the selection: the water polo Olympic final. Presentation of the players on the Spanish team. The Spanish water polo team is playing today in the Barcelona '92 final against Italy. Italy has two gold medals in its showcases. In front of over 14,000 spectators in the stadium and millions at home, it's going to be the most-watched game in the history of water polo. SPAIN 0 - 0 ITALY FIRST QUARTER Come on, come on. The Olympic final has started! Let's see if Javi Franco can get the first ball of the game. Come on. Come on, Javi! Spain is running out of possession time. They have to shoot, but the Italian defence is blocking the Spanish team's attack. Italy regains the ball, one of their main weapons is their speed. We need to watch out for that. Apply pressure. Fuck! Fantastic goal by Giovanni. First display of talent from the Italian team. This is going to be a tough game. Spain 0 - 1 Italy It's fine, don't worry! Keep going! Come on! Ball blocked! The Italian defence is a wall. It's impossible! - Shoot, Manel! Go harder, guys! We want a miracle! End of the first quarter with a 0 - 2 disadvantage for the team captained by Manel Estiarte. They marking us one on one, we're not used to it. Get my players some water. SPAIN 0 - 2 ITALY SECOND QUARTER The second quarter has begun. Spain has a better idea in terms of attacking. Fuck. Manel Estiarte scores! At last, the Spanish team has knocked down the Italian wall. The problem isn't only the defensive wall, but also the artillery in their attack. Fuck! The game is an uphill battle for the Spanish who are losing 1 - 3 as we draw towards halftime. That's a fourth goal, maybe the nail in the coffin. SPAIN 1 - 4 ITALY Come on. It's halftime and we have a clear advantage. It would be difficult for Italy to lose this game. No way, Manel. - Did you see? - Calm down. This isn't the time, Arnau. Calm down. - They're walking all over us! We need to mark them, we need a stronger defence. - Enough. - That's enough. We can't break down. We all have to defend and we know how. Pedro's right. Think they're better? Maybe. Think they deserve to win? I don't think so. Because you've earned the right to be here. You were nobodies and now they respect you because you're a team. - Come on, let's go. - Team. We're a team. We're together, guys. The third quarter has started. SPAIN 1 - 4 ITALY THIRD QUARTER Goal! What a goal! Pedro Aguado is gaining ground! Yes! Let's go! Is going for the ball but there's another Italian goal. Come on! Referee calls foul. Estiarte isn't ready to leave the pool. It's in the area, the ball goes to Pedro. Pedro gets it and goal! Goal! Amazing goal by Pedro! Pedro García Toto shows us his great talent with these two goals. Sixth goal for Italy. Three minutes left in the third quarter and Spain's losing 3 - 6, but the team's response is promising. - Goal, goal! Yes! - Yes! Goal! Spain's getting into it! The third quarter ends with Spain 5 - 6 Italy. SPAIN 5 - 6 ITALY FOURTH QUARTER The fourth quarter begins. Spain has six minutes to come out as winners in this Barcelona '92 Olympic final. Come on! Javi, don't let him shoot! Fuck! Spain 5 - 7 Italy. This is an incredible game and it's not over yet. Come on. Come on. SPAIN 5 - 6 ITALY SPAIN 5 - 7 ITALY Pedro Aguado is turning it around with an incredible long shot! What a save from Jesús Rollán! Spain has gathered speed. What is it? Filippo is saying his cap is ripped and he needs another one. I have to change it. It's broken. - Come on, ref. - What the fuck are you doing? Don't be lazy, move! Take it easy. Relax. We'll get one, calm down. - Just two minutes left. What? Are you kidding? Just as Spain had a good attack opportunity, he happens to rip his cap. - Damn it! - Manel! - There's no time. - We must score. SPAIN 6 - 7 ITALY Just 50 seconds left. Time is running out and Spain is losing by one. Spain draws in the last minute! That's it! The 7 - 7 forces extra time. A nail-biting end worthy of an Olympic final. Matutinović's guys have come back from a game that seemed already lost. Come on, come on. Spain 7 - 7 Italy. Hey, Manel. - Manel. - Thanks, Joan. We're reaching our limits, but they're worse off. We must hang in there. We're so close, guys. Let's give it our all in the water. Let's give it our all! - Come on. - Let's go! Six minutes of extra time. The physical shape of the players on both teams will definitely decide the end result. SPAIN 7 - 7 ITALY EXTRA TIME Take that! No way... Foul in favour of Spain. Penalty! And the referees are whistling for four metres! Come on, come on! This moment could be decisive. If Spain scores, they go into the lead with one minute left. You take the shot. He knows me from the Italian league. You'll score. Manel Estiarte is facing his team mate from the Italian league. If anybody knows how Manel does penalties, it's precisely this Italian keeper. Manuel, give this one to us. Shoot to the right, just how you like it. To the right, come on. To the right and down a little. Cut it out. Estiarte is about to shoot the penalty but the Italians won't let him. If he gets the penalty, we're Olympic champions. It's a tense moment. I can't watch. Goal! Estiarte scores! Of course he did! Yes! Yes, take that! Come on, come on! If we hang on for 42 seconds, we'll be Olympic champions! Just 42 seconds! Guys, guys! We haven't won yet! Press defence! Press defence? What the fuck? Manel. Press defence! Press defence! Dragan wants press defence, but they're not used to that. Get down! Get the defence down! He's free! No, no! Fuck! Goal! Yes! Fuck! Fuck! A bad defensive move takes the gold medal away from the Spanish team. Only Italy could do this. We'll have a second extra time. This is incredible. The physical shape of the players will mark the destiny of this game. The conceded goal was a hard blow which is added to the physical exhaustion of having to play a second extra time. Who will last longer? SPAIN 8 - 8 ITALY SECOND EXTRA TIME Let's go! Spain won't give up. End of the second extra time. It's still 8 - 8. There's a third extra time. This is a first for an Olympic final. We're playing for a third time. If the players don't drown first. It's so important to get this first possession. And Javi Franco gets it, what a physique, what a sprint. First shot, the Spanish are attacking. Pedro gets the ball. Looks like he has a chance. It's fine. They need to get up and try again. Come on! Come on! No! Goal for Italy. And this could be the end. It's been an incredible game. I've never seen one like it. Come on, there's still time! Come on! We still have time! Come on, damn it! - Let's go! - Come on! The last few changes. There's 32 seconds left. Anything could happen. We have to try. Come on! Spain 8 - 9 Italy. Spain has lost the gold. We had it but now we've lost it. It's moments like these that make sport more than just sport. Almost, eh? We were so fucking close. Thanks, Toto.
