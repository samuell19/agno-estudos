Mr. Eden! Pull yourself together! Can't you keep them under control'! What a disgrace! Nurse Nikola, first learn how to shove a stretcher! Dr. Bruckner, the shooting victims. Where to'! With the others in room 2. I beg your pardon! - They just mutilated each other. Right, I bet they've learned their lesson. You take the responsibility. - I know what I'm doing. It's incredible what people in our society are capable of. - So right, Mr. Eden. VIETNAM 1969 Headquarters of the American Forces Sir, this is Private Brian. I've heard about him, Chief Counsellor. - I request that Private Brian be suspended from military service. Three of his brothers have already died. He's the only survivor. I'm afraid, sir. I love our country, but I keep thinking of home. You're a hero, Private. I approve your request. - Thank you, sir. But you have one final mission before you can return home. We have 2 traitors in our midst. 'Lore and Mas. Those two crooks have swiped the most modern weapons in the entire US Army and are hiding somewhere in the Golden Triangle. A combat unit led by our Swiss weapons expert Dr. Herbert Ost was able to confiscate the weapons. But after that we lost all contact. That's terrible, sir. More than terrible, Private! This is a disaster! The war's lost without those weapons! They must be found at once! And those criminals must be apprehended! - Excuse me, sir! I don't think he'll make it. Calm down, Major. He doesn't have to go alone. Damn it! This mission is being led by one of our best men! And that private will get you home safe and sound! That can only be Jackson. Jackson will get you outta there. Don't worry. He's a pro. Can he bring me home, sir'! He's brought so many guys home. I bet he used to work for UPS. Sir, has Jackson ever killed anybody'! Has he ever killed anybody'! He's killed so many people. There's hardly anyone he hasn't killed. No idea what he used to drink, but I'm sure it wasn't mother's milk. Anyway, he's a real pro, maybe the best damned soldier in the US Army. Sir, I'm pleased to be able to meet Jackson. You ought a be. It's a damn honor to meet Jackson. Most of the people who met Jackson ended up dead. Sir, can he bring me home'! - Am I talking Serbo-Croatian? Of course he can bring you home. That's why he's here. That's Jackson! Jackson, fall in! I think he's coming down. Yes, sir! This is Private Brian, the 2nd man. Bring him home in one piece! No problem, sir. The American president said, "Bring him home alive." Oh. Well, I think I can do it. Sir, can he bring me home'! - Sure, no problem. They shot him in the gut. He probably won't make it. At least he died a hero. Come on. We gotta move out. I'm not gonna ask you again. Where are those damn weapons'! I got no idea! Can you see anything? - Shut up, Ralf. I gotta concentrate. What's going on'? I gotta concentrate. You better talk, you damn chink! - I'm Swiss. I'm a scientist. Come on, move it! This jungle is fucking dangerous! Jackson - What'! - What kind of guys are those deserters? Zorc and Atlas were in my unit. Now they've joined the chinks. They betrayed America, but I swear to you. They're gonna pay. Jackson, I came here to grill those chinks, but now I'm afraid. I wanna go home. I can't stand it. Calm down, kid. Just watch where you step. Those chinks are everywhere. Those guys are damn tricky! Fucking Vietcong. I almost got killed twice. Remember, if you pay attention and watch your step, Nothing will happen. Every step could be your last. We gotta get going. Come on. - I'll do everything you say. Shit! Damn Charlies! Something's fishy out there. Boss, I got a feeling something's fishy. Like what'! Believe me when I tell you! I wasn't trained for nothing! This isn't my first war. I was a member of Delta Force. I also studied weaponry. For 2 years. - Yeah, sure, Atlas. Back to you, you stinking Jap. You heard us. Time's running out. I'll count to three. - But I'm Swiss! One TWO three! Somebody's up there! Everybody out! What's wrong with you'! I gave you an order! You guys just used me. I'm fighting for peace. I got a disco waiting for me. I don't care what you think, dreamer! We're only here for one thing: money! Disco, war all just business. Get outta here! Jackson! Is that you'! Welcome home! You haven't gotten any faster, Jackson! We don't get any younger. But it'll be your undoing. I'm still faster than you! That's why you kicked me outta your unit. I hate your unit. And you know it. You're a waste of energy. Fuck your unit! You're always on the wrong side. Together we could be rich and famous. Not necessarily handsome, but at least rich and famous. This is war. You know what that is'! War is You don't know, do you'! And I'm not gonna tell you No way! You killed Jackson. I'm proud of you. You're gonna be promoted. You got a great career ahead. I can see medals. Your jacket's still bare. You need a medal. What was your name'! Who cares! I'll know it some time. I'm proud of you. You're my son Yes, my son. I smell you, Jackson! If you smell me, how come you kill your own men'! Things like that can happen in war. Goodness gracious! Back when you were in my unit, you were a real pro. Fuck your unit! Ever since I got outta your unit I've been a pro. - Bullshit! Come up here and we'll talk. We're at war. We don't solve problems by having a chat. I'm coming down now, and I'm gonna blast your brains out. You're dead, Zorc! I've had enough of your violence. I can't take it. I'm leaving. What's your problem'! It wasn't that bad, was it'! TOP SECRET I have a soft spot for Koreans. Get moving, buddy. Your vacation is over. Your vacation in Vietnam is over. Is that all you learned'! - I'm gonna kill you! And you were in my unit! What an insult! You're a wash-out! A real combat wash-out! I went through hard training. - I'd never guess. Outta ammunition'! Take that! Jackson, don't move! I'm gonna get you! You coward! You lazy bastard. Move your fucking ass! 20 years later. Atlas, you lazy bastard. I'm sick of it! You lie around all day, and we do all the work. I've had it! Atlas, you got a visitor. Atlas - Zorc! How nice you're still alive. What a dump. And you've been doing time here for 20 years'! For 20 years! - Listen, Atlas. You're still my adjutant, and I expect obedience. I need you for an extremely important mission. An awful lot depends on it. And you'll have the chance to kill your arch enemy. Jackson, or do you mean Jackson'! Yeah, I'm gonna pay your bail. And Jackson, don't run away. Sir! Are we gonna win this time, sir'! To all ninjas: Kill Jackson. He lives here Signed: Atlas. What a pain in the ass with those ninjas. It never ends. Nice the latest "Barett". Bills bills Looks like a job. Zorc he dares to come to my town. I don't believe it. You fucking assholes! Listen to me Mr. Eden. I'm Horst GÃ©sing from the GUG, German Union Germany. A place like this is a pain in the ass. It makes me puke. I can't stand it. Pick up this creature. I don't believe it! Listen here. I got a vision for this region. And guys like you are in my way. This is gonna be Party Headquarters. We'll make this land flourish. And a guy like you just doesn't fit in the picture. You see'! He's in debt, too. - In debt'! You're a welfare case, a burden on society. That's not nice of you. How do you know'! All I have to do is look at you. I see guys like you on every corner. It makes me puke. I can't stand it. We got a vision of a beautiful life. Write that down: "Life should be beautiful." Look at you in your spangled shit! Terrible. Are these your friends'! Not now, Ramirez! Lady and gentlemen, know what this is'! I want to ofter you a deal. It's top-quality stuff. Ramirez! I'd normally ask 100 for this bag, but for you I'll say 50. I don't believe it! Get him outta here! Off the premises! 30 would be okay That's what I mean! - Leave him alone! We gotta get rid of those bums. All that rifi-rafi you attract. Incredible! Is he gone'! Thank God. You disgusting politician! - Get her outta here! You've ruined our bar! - Leave her alone! Ralf! - Eden, you and your whores, niggers, drug dealers I'm not a whore any more! - You're an indecent person. And you are, too. You're the cause of all this. Listen, I'll give you some good advice. At 7 a.m. on Sunday Write that down. We'll be back. And this whore and all the niggers and drug dealers are gonna be gone! Understand'! We aren't going anywhere! - Have a nice day. Calm down! Fuck 'em! - Our beautiful bar! What a flicking day! - Fucking politicians! Yeah, come here. I'll give you the old one-two. That was a real bull's eye. Meike, want a smoke'! - No. No'! - I don't smoke, Daddy. Don't ever start either. Watch this. A lesson for life. The toughest men have the biggest guns. Remember that. Let me tell you about the situation in our yard. The guys with the black masks are bad guys. But the guy with the black hat and the puppet is even worse. Keep on going when you see him. Don't talk to him. And they're bad guys, too, the ones with the shirts and ties. We don't like them at all, okay'! Watch, I'll show you what to do. That's it. Hey Ralf, how're you doing'! - Terrific! - Don't move! It's just a scratch. Those tucking Nazis get on my nerves. Did you see me chase 'em'! The old one-two. I wanted to kick 'em, but they were gone. - Knock it off, will you! That would've been great, but where were you'! What can I do when they're gone'! - What can I do'! What's your problem'! - Fucking Nazis. Ban 'em! I decide who gets banned from the bar. Do you understand'! So shut up. - May I'! Ralf Eden! So, we meet again. The aging Hippie, huh'! Long time, no see, my friend. You got short hair now. You're in business, huh'! I never thought you had it in you. Hold this. As a soldier, you were a coward. But now you've established a nice little nightclub, huh'! Hey Ralf, don't you recognize me'! It's me, Zorc. From the war. - Doesn't ring a bell. Back in Vietnam! I guess I made a mistake. Nevertheless, you got a nice club. What's your price'! Aha! You aren't the first, but May I'! - Yes. Let's go to my office. Are you sad, Daddy'! - Yeah, Meike. I'm a bit sad, 'cause there aren't many jobs for a bounty hunter now. It was different in the 80s. I had loads of jobs. Before that, there was war. And that was okay. But now'! I have to catch a few crooks, so we have a little spending money. Everyihing'll be all right. Those guys aren't worth much, but it's still money. So, you want to buy my disco'! Why'! Look at this map. As you can see, the border between America and lraq is only 1 kilometer away. You could advertise in lraq, and you'd have lots more customers. I don't want to drive you away. You could be my janitor manager. You know what, Mr. Zorc'! I built this place all by myself. I can now afford expensive pictures, like that masterpiece. I got all I need. Why give it up'! Anyway, a lot of other people are interested, too. I ofter you 100,000 dollars. - Okay, I'll draw up the contract. SAY IT NOW! Welcome. Thank you for tuning into SAY IT NOW! Our topic tonight: "War and Afterwards." You've all seen it. You turn on the TV and see a report about war. You look at the paper and read about war. War is everywhere. And that is the topic we want to talk about today. My first guest was in the war. Please, give a warm welcome to Mr. Jackson. You're 48 years old. - I'm 48. And you were in - Vietnam. - Exactly. - The Vietnam War. I'm a veteran. And I'm American. But who cares! I'm unemployed, although I have a daughter who's five. How can you support her'! - I'm a bounty hunter. - Ah. And you think it's the right job'! You think you can kill people, and the money you get is "good for my daughter." That money'! It's just money, and I work hard to get it. And that gives you the right to kill'! - They are bad guys. I shoot ninjas. There's a bounty for them. Mostly alive, not dead, but they usually aren't so fussy. You have no qualms about killing'! Incredible! Incredible! And now I'd like to talk to someone who knows a lot about this, Professor Dr. Rildiger Stef ten. Thank you. I'm glad to have you here tonight. Please tell me and the audience and Mr. Jackson, what your profession is. I'm a media expert. I have a PhD. I use my knowledge to protect adolescents and people who are easily influenced from people like you. - What for'! - Certain forms of violence are encouraged. To me, you're an anachronism. A communism'! To me, you're a war criminal. Yes! I found an interesting fact on the Internet, and I believe it's of interest to us and to the viewers at home. Mr. Jackson, is it true that you Just a moment. You're boring us. Please! - Mr. Jackson, this won't bore you for long. It says that you apparently decimated 0,8 percent of the North Vietnamese. Is that right'! - Yes, it is. That was during the war. But after the war you are said to have "eliminated" up to 800 ninjas. 800'! - It might even be Right - Even more'! Recent studies show that the number of unreported cases could be higher. And you think that all the men When am I on'! I'm sick of waiting! I've been waiting for this moment! What're you doing here'! - 20 years ago! You should've been in longer! I was in prison for 20 years, 20 innocent years! - This is Mr. Atlas. You went to war, and after the war you were able to create a new existence. - Yep! What do you do'! - I work. What do you do'! Do you know Zorc'! Zorc and I Zorc! - We have We have a bar. Yes. - I do different odd jobs. And I have some ninjas I'm always blasting 'em away. So just wait. Soon you won't have any. Mr. Jackson, it's obvious. You're "blasting away" ninjas I get money for it. But this man is more creative. He hires ninjas. Have you ever considered retraining'! - Retraining! Wham cam he be renamed as'! - Ms. Khmer! He should go to prison and never come out again. You should go to prison instead of living off us decent folks. He has no job! I got a job! Are you aware of the taxes you pay'! You're paying for a bum like that! He said that he pays taxes for every ninja he kills. Listen - I got a job. And that's why I'm here. - Wonderful. We're pleased to hear that. - I got a job, but no work. That's the difference. - You've already told us enough about your job. Wanna get slugged? - You see'! That's what we're talking about I'm not the wimp you think I am. Know what my friends call me'! Gay'! - The Cobra. - Real tough. Gee whiz. The Cobra? Mr. Jackson, I'd like to invite you to one of my seminars: "Communication on the Way to God." - Give him a hand! At the night school in Neverhorst. And I invite you to attend my course. It's called: "Reactions in Close Combat." And here's the first lesson! Hit him! Hit him! Kick him! Kick him! Hit him again! Stop! Keep going! - Damn ninjas. I gotta get back to work. Okay, let's go. I'll see you next week at my seminar "Communication As a Solution to Conflicts on the Way to God." What're you staring at'! Like it'! I'm a victim of the war! A victim of violence! You are the disease, Mr. Jackson. And I'm the medicine. So, Mr. Jackson, is that enough war'! Say it now! Invitation to the opening of the disco "Dance Sensation" by Zorc. You, Herbert Ost, are invited. Best regards, Zorc and Atlas. This is Veronica Hell, live from the disco Dance Sensation. Tonight's the night, the long-awaited re-opening. Next to me, I'm proud to say, is the owner, Ralf Eden. How are you doing now, just before opening night? I got butterflies. No, I'm used to it. - Sorry, I hear our camera outside is ready to go. Let's see what's going on outside. Are you ready'! Take it away. You can see it on the monitor. The place is jumping. Who's on the guest list'! Naturally, the best DJ in the whole world, Wolfgang Jack. - He is famous for a particular sound which originated at this disco. Can you describe it'! You're a good dancer yourself. - Yes, he finds the right rhythm. You just can't sit still. - I see local dancing queens up front. It's a real WHO IS WHO of the dancing scene. Right, Ralf'! - Yes. Everybody's already dancing outside. They just can't wait. Some won't even get in, but they don't know it yet. - It's well known thank you that the bouncers at Dance Sensation have incredible rules and requirements. Many people are rejected. What's your policy'! - Tommy Drombusch. Yes, well. I instruct the bouncers myself, 'cause I want this place to be clean. For a time we were worried about Ralf Eden. He disappeared for a while, then he made headlines. And the question people keep asking: Why isn't there a woman at the side of such a successful and good-looking man'! What does your dream woman look like, if I may ask Just kidding. Just like you I'm just kidding, too. We'll wrap it up with those words. All the best to you. Ralf Eden, ladies and gentlemen. My pleasure to report for Live Backstage. Good luck for the grand re-opening. All the best, Ralf. See you soon. You gotta hand it to Zorc. The place is jumping. - Think so'! I don't know. The people are so strange. Has anybody seen my coke'! - Somewhere back there. Hey sweethearts. You doing fine'! - Yeah. I'm Ramirez. I sell drugs. What've you got'! - Looks like you need something'! Try this stuff here. Hey Jackson, next time you gotta pay. Sinners! Babylon! I condemn all of this! Disgusting sinners! You won't get to Heaven like that! Look who's here. In public. Leave me alone! - How dare you appear in public after your appearance on TV. Want a face job'! Jackson! Zorc Who knows what you're up to with Atlas and the disco. But let me tell you, I don't trust you. - I can't stand you, Jackson. Look at my face. Do you think it's funny'! - My God. Other people have no legs or arms, or they're blind. And you worry about acne'! Acne'! I'm talking about napalm. If we were at war, I'd shoot you on the spot. But I see that people are having a good time. So I'll wait. - Why not give an ex-con the chance to be resocialized. You call this resocializing? At this joint? The place has gone downhill. All I see are proles. That'll change immediately. We're expecting an intelligent VIP from Switzerland, Dr. Herbert Ost. I'm here! I'm Swiss Where are the damn weapons'! Inâ Weapons'! Isn't that the China man you beat the hell out of'! So, how are your tests going for a home-brand beer'! We've received our first results. I'll have a report sent to you. I will be available in the next few days. Good evening, pretty girl. May I sit down'! My name is Merten, Hans Merten. I'm from Germany. You're a super woman. I noticed immediately. Are you interested in politics'! You know, I'm a Party member. I'm even an executive member. We're gonna buy this place. It'll soon be ours. But we feel that a lot of this rifi-rafi will have to leave, so our kids can live here in peace and People are always dropping during the war. I went to war. I was in it big time. I saw people die, but that wasn't so bad. I killed most of 'em myself. I killed lots of 'em. Then I was in prison for a long time, 10 or 20 years. No one really knows. I also have a revolver Automatic. It's an automatic with 8 bullets, and you can And then you can And you can - Atlas, got alight? How do you do it with the women'! - What'! They always walk away from me. Oh, forget it. I don't have time to shoot the shit. It's my girl's birthday. - Okay. What? It's her birthday tomorrow, and I gotta bake a cake. - Honest'! - Yeah. Was that an invitation? Hi. Goddamn it! This used to be my place! Understand'! I built it up all by myself. And Zorc took everything away from me! Aren't you interested in what I'm telling you'! Good evening. I'm the new manager here. Ralf, get some drinks. You see that the lady needs a drink. Beat it! Are you new here'! I've never seen you before. The drinks are on the house. It goes without saying. TOP SECRET Eden! Where are the drinks'! Here Yummy cake! There are only 4 candles on it, but I'm 5 today. No problem. Watch this. There we go. Now eat up that cake, kids. Yummy yummy- I don't remember inviting you, Atlas. This is my daughter's party. And you aren't welcome. That isn't what you said yesterday. What do you mean'! Would I invite guys I've hated since we were in Vietnam'! Hey man, we got loads of presents. Ninja, Ralf and I got 'em together. Okay, since you're already here I got some cake left. Sit down. I'll get you some coffee. Good deal. Ralf doesn't drink coffee. You kids go inside. These men here aren't very nice. Come here, Atlas. Sit down at the table, and put the presents over there. I don't really know what to do. You guys feel like playing a game'! Okay, this chocolate is wrapped in newspaper. We use a fork and knife to open it. But only when we get a 6. Beforehand, we put on these gloves, this scarf and this hat. Now I roll the dice. I got a 6, so I go to work on the chocolate. The next guy rolls 'em, and if he gets a 6, he gets the hat, the gloves and the scarf and tries to cut open the chocolate. The winner is the one who eats the chocolate. Is that clear'! Let's start. It's my party, so I begin. Anybody object'? No'? Okay. Gimme it. Why do you keep dragging around that ninja? Nothing's happened. He hasn't taken anything yet. It's really close. A 6! Now I have a six! Hey buddy, you did a good job of preparing it for me. But you're only here to carry out orders Did you forget'! Asshole! Hey, that's expensive! He isn't even wearing the hat! He isn't even wearing the hat. You're cheating! You're cheating! You're not wearing the hat! Leave the ninja alone! You're not wearing the hat! Gimme that! Are you nuts'! Disguise yourself! You're a ninja! Where's the dice'! - I haven't seen 'em! And now you're eating? I haven't seen the dice. Find 'em. I need the scarf. Where's the dice'! - Want me to look'! Where's the damn scarf'! How come you got the scarf'! Six! - No six! - Six! Six! That damn ninja again! Sorry! Sorry! He was cheating. You saw that. That's put a damper on things. Who won anyway? Atlas to headquarters. I need a new ninja. Sit down. - What do you mean'! Dragging in another ninja! The first one wasn't even invited, and here comes the next one! Be happy I only came with one. Normally I come with two or three. It's my daughter's party, and I don't have enough cake. What the hell! You and your fucking cake! You're like a housewife! Atlas to headquarters. Send some more ninjas. What the hell! Why do you have to start acting like a child again? - Cool it! I'm gonna get cigarettes. Get lost, Ralf. - And you get lost, too. No, I won't. I'm staying. Atlas and his ninjas! What a pain in the ass! Have another piece of cake. You can eat it all. Well'! Where are the damn weapons'! Without them, there's no need to mix this fuel. Is there'! Am I right'! Damn it! I've searched the whole fucking club! But I can't find 'em! That Ralf Eden is such a pain in the butt! He pickled his brain. He didn't even recognize me. Fucking conscientious objector! How should he know where he's hidden weapons in some dark corner of his pseudo-club'! If he has them at all. - I once saw him go up to the attic, where he fiddled around behind a door. What'! Can't you ever give me important info a bit sooner'! Yes? Yes, okay. Ost, our clients are here. Atlas Check it out. And if those are the weapons we're looking for, leave them there. And not a word to Ralf. Understand'! Come on, Ost. Ah, my friends! Mr. Zorc! I greet you on behalf of the Iraqi people. Our best iron and copper smithies have made this facharach as a present for you. Gentlemen, Dr. Herbert Ost, our head chemist from Switzerland. The tremendous effect of the weapons is increased enormously by my highly explosive mixture. All you have to do is insert it into the rockets. 100,000 liters are ready. 50,000 liters are in preparation. But how do we smuggle it over the border'! No problem. The fuel is perfectly disguised. You are already holding it. - What'! As beer'! What about side-effects'! Side what'! - Of course not. Okay, tomorrow evening. Do we have the go-ahead? - Don't worry, my friends. The rabble will be busy. Contest! Dance Contest! Hello! - Hello, Meike. - Hello, Grandma. Little doll, sit down. I gotta work for a few days. Can you look after Meike'! Yes, we get along well. I'll be gone a few days, and then I'll pick her up. Sure thing. Meike, Daddy's gotta earn some money. BYE-Wu.! Look at this, doll. Isn't it nice'! This is Veronica Hell from backstage at Dance Sensation. At my side, a man I've almost become friends with, Ralf Eden. - Hello. We're here tonight for Avery special event: a dance contest. It will be a sensation. Of course, the club is called Dance Sensation. That just dawned on me. Tonight lots of people will be on stage doing their best. Is there a prize'! - This here is the prize. Is this a facharach? - No idea. It could be. Yes, it's of Iraqi origin. - My God, I'm amazed. I was a foreign correspondent in Iraq. - Your own fault. Oh well Nevertheless, I dare to predict that the person who wins the dance contest at Dance Sensation could possibly launch a career in show business. Is that right, Ralf'! I suppose so. Why not'! My disco is known all over town and even beyond that. We're getting more attention than ever. We have a good chance in the media. And those who want to will become what they want. I cross my fingers that this event will be an awesome one. And I hope to be back soon. Yeah, I gotta say something and get it off my chest. Everybody in town knows DJ Wolfgang Jack. - Yes. It's a sensation, a real sensation. He won't just let his records talk. He'll also emcee a bit and open his trap, to put it bluntly. So that's it. - That DJ's a great guy. Maybe we could meet sometime. - He could be a bit cheaper but who cares. And I'd really like to meet him. - Yes - Could you arrange it'! What's what's all this about'! You see, Wolfgang Jack Is he that great? I wouldn't overdo it. He isn't that great. Now back to the studio. Jackson, what're you doing here'! Get lost! You ruined my daughter's birthday party! It was a fucking party! - Cool it! Can't you two clowns behave for once tonight? There are other people here, too! Things are jumping here! Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention? As the mayor, I want to thank Mr. Zorc for creating this disco, where young people and the young at heart, like me, can meet and have a nice time together. Speaking of nice times, I'd like to mention that Mr. Zorc has founded a brewery, and I feel we should support Mr. Zorc. I'll be a good example and extol this great beer Atomic Blast. And let me say this: Alcohol can sometimes help you get through difficult times. I remember getting shot in the stomach and being badly wounded by the Vietcong and lying in a field hospital. Listen, we're outta drinks. Go up and get some more. You're so drunk. It made me feel that better times were coming. Are you okay'! In a good mood'! You wanna win the trophy'! As you all know, we're gonna honor the best dancer in town. I brought my hottest records from Vienna. Our ninja jury will decide. So move those hips! Get in the mood! Show your tits! And let's go! No! Zorc, I found your damn weapons. The ones you've been looking for. - Fantastic! An important message. The war has been lost. Now, of all times! Damn it! Okay, listen. A new plan. We'll take the weapons to America and hide them there. - I got a disco where we can keep 'em. Lieutenant Zorc, you're under arrest for treason against America. They really fucked me over. I want to win. The Lord is with me. Don't you like Atlas? Atlas, a gun is no argument. Put that gun away. Don't boo at Atlas anymore, 'cause he dances just as great as he fights. So I'd say, dance a bit! Terrific. Following Atlas that was really weak. Now I'm sure you all know the next competitor, the ninja. You all know Ramirez. He has one of the sexiest asses in town. What an ass! You think drugs are cool'! Huh'! Try this stuff. I love your stuff, Ramirez, and I hope your dancing is as good as your stuff. Okay men, tie your women down, 'cause its time for you-know-who. When I say Jackson I don't mean Michael. You can stop screaming. Michael Jackson has vanished. And now the real Jackson Jackson! Man, what a night. It sure paid off. Who are these guys anyway'? Good evening. I'm Ramirez. I'm a businessman like you. You know what I got for you'! Look at this. Did Atlas dance like shit'! How was Atlas? And how's Jackson'! Now we're gonna dance like "Blood on the Dance floor." Excuse me! - Don't interrupt. Now if you'd come over to me, you'll get the first sample for free. To celebrate, I've brought along a little champagne, gentlemen. Back in Vietnam, I didn't really think much of you, but let bygones be bygones. What our country and our little town owe both of you, Mr. Zorc and Mr. Atlas, that's quite a lot. And I want to thank you for it. Cheers. - Cheers. Mr. Zorc! We've taken over the town as planned. - You can assume office. Fantastic. What about the payment'! Then everything's okay. Enjoy the weapons, and don't forget the Atomic Blast. Mr. Zorc, we want to surprise you with a little present. On behalf of our people, we would like to tell you as the new mayor of this lovely little town congratulations. We'll cooperate fantastically. Hold on! I'm still the mayor of this lovely little town. How ridiculous, you fucking camel drivers. You can't hurt me with those toy guns. An old war injury. Why do you think I'm in the chair'! It was 1969. We were in Vietnam. The Charlies were all around. Jackson was there, too. Here you are. - Thank you. Great! Stop! No entry! Where's the men's room'! No toilets here. Mr. Atlas! Mr. Atlas! Wait a sec! The triumphant Iraqi nation also has a little surprise for you. We wanted to congratulate you as the new city manager. Thank you. I gotta get back to the contest. The ceremony is starting. You and the ninja tied. The ninja he was disqualified. He wasn't so good. He cheated. Forget that ceremony. The town is now ours. And it's time to eliminate the town hero Jackson'! You mean Jackson'! Excuse me. You aren't gonna urinate here, are you'! Do you do that at home, too'! Get outta here! And that's mine. To all ninjas! Red alert! Jackson's running around free. You gotta kill him. Top priority! Everybody fan out! Every ninja should get his ass in gear and get out there and get Jackson! Understand'! I don't know where he is. Look everywhere! Look behind the DJ's console if the bastard's hiding there. What'! The darkroom's locked'! I don't give a shit who's in there, even if it's a politician! Look everywhere! Find that bastard! He's dangerous. He'll kill us all. Okay, not me, but you're cannon fodder for him. He's killed 40 already'! Things are getting hot. I've thought up a new strategy. I want you to put on Don't put on gym shoes! You idiot! What a stupid idea! Why do you need so many men to kill just one man'! - It's inefficient. Tell your ninjas to help us load the boxes. No showers. You gotta move it. It's an emergency! Leave your stars at home, you bums! Take the southern wing. You gotta Hey, Atlas, if you like, I'll cut his throat. Put away your knife, and shut your mouth! It's so amusing when your toy army tries to use big words. Very funny. if Jackson could hear you he'd laugh to death. Mr. Atlas, my men are patriots! - They're nothing! Jackson and I could kill 'em all in a jiffy. And don't you forget it. Damn it! Is it true what I see'! There are now over 600'! Our losses are increasing drastically. Get the mega-weapons. Jackson won't stand a chance. Out of the question. The weapons now belong to the Iraqi people. We just paid in cash. That's practical. Get 'em. Okay. And now I'm going after Jackson myself. To all units We've been done in by Zorc and Atlas. Stef ft, did you get the rings'! Oh no, what happened here'! My disco! Atlas, you ruined my place! - It isn't your place! Let me let me go! I thought you were in love with me. Jackson speaking. - Hey, where are you now'! I'm at work. - Ah, like a good boy. What did you do'! - We read and played games. But the weather's really bad today, really bad. I'm glad I'm not outside. Is our little doll really allowed to watch TV'! Whatever she wants. Just no sex movies. Okay, see you later. Yeah, okay, bye. Hey, guys! The deal's been called off. Leave everything where it is. I never believed in violence. Ramirez, no! Ramirez, my dear friend! Oh God! No! Won't it ever stop'! This senseless killing! It was all my fault. If only I hadn't teamed up with Zorc! Let's have a drink. Oh God! What a wipe-out! The Iraqis are here. Zorc's raising hell. Jackson, it's all my fault. I brought all this stuff over and stored it here. Oh God! I'm a traitor! What stuff'! - Over there! There's one box left. Atlas took all the rest. - Where's he heading'! To the border. So open your secret crate, Ralf. Don't you know what this is, Ralf'! Those are the weapons that Zorc stole back then. That's why we lost in Vietnam. - I know! I know! That's why he bought my place because of the guns. If you'd told me, I'd have shot him down like a dog. I needed the money. - I forgot. - What did you forget'! I suffer from amnesia. - Is that all you have'? Amnesia'! - Isn't that enough'! I can put things right. First I gotta shoot Atlas. Good morning, Mr. Eden. Sunday, 7 a.m. The ultimatum has expired. Sell or not'! What's your answer'! Border 1 kilometer This lovely piece has collected dust in your attic for 20 years. I had no idea. Ralf, where are you'! My God, what happened'! Ramirez? Ralf! Janet, my love, I made millions on 20-year-old weapons. I made hundreds of thousands out of this little joint. I've even become the mayor of this wonderful little town. All that is missing to make me happy is you, Janet. You will now become my First Lady. What did you do that for'! Does that mean no'! I'm in love with you, and you stomp all over my feelings. We'll get married now. Come on, help me, Stef ft. What a beauty! I'll fire it. Hello, this is Atlas. Exactly. I'm at the border with this super gun I was able to put it together, but it's heavy and can't shoot. Can you send me some reinforcements'! 6 or 7 ninjas Give me more. 60 ninjas or something like that. I really need 'em. Would you do that'! Okay, thanks. Bye. What's wrong with you'! You're so cold. I always treated you tenderly. Since the first time we met. Border USA/Iraq Now we'll get married. We'll tell Atlas. Our best friend will be our best man. Where is he anyway'! Atlas? Goodness gracious. What a big Colt. You bet, Ralf. Yes, Atlas We're back again at the front. At home. We're better at this than dancing Saturday nights at the disco. So, Jackson it's time to settle the score. Who's that'! - I'd like to know myself. It's Atlas. He says that his is bigger. Then tell him ours is longer. If you say so. Are you afraid'! You were a conscientious objector. I've sent it. Okay, Ralf, get a gun and try to come up from behind. Hey, I've never killed anybody. Atlas has never tucked. There's a first time for everyone. Move it! Go on, Jackson. Run away. I would if I was you. My gun's better, bigger and cooler! Okay, I'll let you live. Go away before I change my mind. Now I got you, Jackson. Jackson, your super gun doesn't seem to be working so well, huh'! How embarrassing. - Come on, pull the trigger. What's wrong now'! Fucking range. Do something. Do something. Repair it. Reload it. Who did it'! Who pulled the trigger'! Are you killing your own people, Atlas? Man! Come on, help us reload. We're in the middle of a duel. Another one of our guys. Don't say a word, Jackson! Come here, you guys. I wanna see East Asian martial arts. But what do I see'! Idiots! No bullets. No activity. And no dynamics in our team. We're in the middle of a duel, and you stand around like chickens. Move it, move it, move it! Do something useful. Do something useful. Don't stand around looking stupid. My goodness. What a piece of junk! Now you do it again, and we'll do it again. I don't want any failures I can't breathe. - You aren't supposed to. I'm gonna kill you Yeah, what now'! What now'! - We'll see who's the pro. Hands up! - What're you doing here'! Jackson, I'm a murderer. Atlas, my friend. There you are. I've finally found my First Lady. We're getting married now. Knock it off, Zorc. And let her go. Let her go! - You care about hostages'! - She has nothing to do with it, and she's also the mother of my daughter. Did I miss out on something'! I thought we were together. I should have told you, but I really love Jackson. I've always loved you, Jackson. Please, give us another chance. - Yes, Janet. With you and Meike One big Jackson family. That'd be nice. - Be quiet! All of you! Be quiet! You're the damn culprits! And I'm the victim! | hate you! This is the perfect opportunity for everyone to speak their mind. My arm's starting to fall asleep. So how about it'! Zorc'! I wanna be the mayor. I don't give a damn about the woman. There are enough other chicks in the world. Atlas, what do you want'! - I want to be the city manager. And I finally wanna kill you, Jackson. And otherwise I want to get my disco back and to get home safe. What about you, Ost'! - I wanna rub you all out. All of you! Back in Vietnam you didn't care. You tortured me. Only because you judged me by my looks. And now I wake up every night drenched in sweat. And I remember my own screams. And now you're exploiting my genius! But that's all over now! Okay, Janet. This is men's work. Take cover. Find a safe spot. So, go over there. Damn it! Get going! The bushes no, behind them! No, there! Women! One down. 1 hour later How's it going'! - I don't know if it was a good idea. We have our doubts. Yes, I know. But that isn't what they pay you for.
