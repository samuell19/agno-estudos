'Heatwave' aka 'Dead of Summer' The reconstruction of the damaged city... could only take place within the framework of a new urban plan. The problem was dramatic. Planning and execution of the project, including the surrounding hills... the port area and the real urban centre... were brought to fruition by an international group of architects... with the idea of preserving an aspect of unity and homogeneity in Agadir. Le Corbusier's influence is evident in Elie Azagury and Francois Zevaco. Leading architects of the constructivist style. Cement structures are fully realised in the council housing... in the courthouse, in the fire station, and the post office. Examples of a real school of modern architecture in Morocco. Among the foreign urban planners one cannot forget Alexander Grasse. The popular developer behind the new industrial facilities. Today, the town hall is a symbol of the rebirth of a city... which, on the night of Monday the 29th of February 1960... experienced the most tragic moment in its history. In ten seconds the city was destroyed by an earthquake. Its past, its history, erased. A capital of 35,000 inhabitants reduced to a pile of rubble. In the open spaces among the rubble... the bodies are lined up in macabre order. Calculating the number of dead is a particularly difficult task. The number varies frighteningly between 15,000 and 20,000 victims. The exact number will never be known. Agadir has received aid from all parts of Africa and Europe... and from American naval bases. Assistance of all kinds in the spirit of fraternal solidarity. The work of the rescue teams in the first tragic days... was hindered by the temperature. That winter it reached peaks of fifty degrees in the shade. One of the major problems was tending to the wounded. Agadir had a well equipped hospital... which was destroyed like everything else. The first assistance came from local doctors in the city... and health inspectors from the nearby French base. Military trucks moved through the ruins with water cannons... Go to your Alex. I'm a little American country girl. You really are a sophisticated husband. A real German who adores Africa. Your problem, my dear Joyce. Is that you don't know how to live, you don't settle in. I'm being serious but you never listen. I'm not trying to lecture you. I'm just trying to give you some advice. What's happened to me? It all seems so far away. I'm here in this heat and I can't breathe. This country's unbearable. I shouldn't have come. Why didn't you keep your promise to join me? What do I do? What have I done? Everyone hates me, these faces, these objects, this house which doesn't work. Everything's still, what am I waiting for? How long have I been waiting? A baby. My body's made to have babies. My body's maternal, my body's younger than yours by 15 years, Alex. They're all looking at me. They've seen me. Why won't they leave me be? I'm tired. Tired, tired. My voice is strange, I'm dying of thirst, I'm hot. I should have stayed in Dallas. You should have joined me, Alex. Listen to me, Alex, I have so many things to tell you. I talk to myself. Lots of people talk to themselves who aren't crazy, it's the loneliness. Alex, you never have time for me. The people here don't understand me. The people here bug me, time goes slowly, it's all so still, static, hot. What can I do? Your bright young student. Your weekends in the desert. How many of your precious sculptures have I broken? Two, three? One of them's still intact. It's probably not terracotta. Perhaps it's a red stone from the desert. It's the doll or me. Alex, you're a lunatic. Why don't I feel any remorse? What have I got to be afraid of? I don't know anyone here. I don't even know their language. Besides, I'm an American. What happened to me? It all seems so far away. I'm here, it's hot, I can't breathe. What an unbearable country. I shouldn't have come. Why didn't you keep your promise to join me? Alex, you're a... - Who is it? - Nekla. Nekla. You must go to Mr. Bianchi. Tell him to come here. The air conditioner doesn't work. It's broken. It's broken, air, Bianchi. Yes. Monday. Good. Althulatha means Tuesday. Joyce, please, let's not waste time. Althulatha. Wednesday, Al'arbiea. Good. Thursday, Alkhamis. Try again, Saturday's easy, it's almost like seven. My dear Joyce, as I told you in my last tape sent on the 12th of June... The plan for the reconstruction of the new Medina... has finally been approved by the government in Agadir. Agadir. And this is a great victory for me. And I hope you realise how important this is. Even if, obviously, our marriage will suffer. I've already booked the flight to join you in Dallas. But today, after this morning's meeting... I had them cancel my departure. I know I'm asking a lot but make this one last effort, you join me. You know how much I love you but work comes first. I've got a feeling that we're experimenting with vital... ...in the social structure and human environment of this developing country. But I don't want to bore you with my professional problems. I'm in good health even if the Atlantic climate isn't kind to my rheumatism. You know my routine. The only distraction is hunting, which unfortunately you hate. Don't worry, little Ali is a most expert guide. You won't recognise our house anymore, the building's almost finished. Do you know who's moved in next door? Paco, that young Spanish architect who was always flirting with you. It must have been the wind. The telephone, Nekla! Yes, I'm coming! It's you. Finally. Will you get over here? Nothing's working today. Yes, I'll be waiting. It doesn't matter. Leave it. If all our guests were like you, my dear lady. I can't bear this heat anymore. You'll need a little patience. I'll try and find someone to fix it. On a Sunday? - Look, it's coming in everywhere. - Yes, I know, it's from last night. Will you tell that savage to order mineral water, whiskey, beer, soda. There's nothing left in the house. - Get it fixed as soon as possible. - I understand, Mrs. Grasse. Good day. - The water's full of sand! - There's nothing I can do about it. The door. Hello, lady. What are you doing here? I brought the mineral water, tonic water, and Coca-Cola. I had to walk, that's why I'm late. - Are you new here? - Yes and no. I work a bit here and a bit there, Mrs. Grasse. How do you know my name? It's written here. Besides, who doesn't know the architect? - How much do I owe you? - No hurry, the architect will pay. Goodbye. Hello? Young lady, I can't hear anything. Yes. Yes, Grasse! I'll see you tomorrow. Hello mum, is that you? How are you? No, Alex isn't here, he's gone hunting. No, I really don't think Alex can come to Hamburg. Pardon? So he told you. Yes, I wanted to but... What are you saying? No, everything's fine between us. No, I postponed it. Yes, I'll tell him. Of course I'll tell him. See you soon. And a hug. - Paco? - Is there anything I can do? Did you see that documentary on TV last night? It was filmed around here. They also showed Alexander's new project. - Is there anything I can do? - No, nothing. Coca-Cola. Where's Mr. Alex? Doesn't he want to talk to Ali anymore? Why? What have I done? You just don't get it, do you? Leave him alone, find someone else. Find who? He takes me hunting. Doctor Volterra! One moment! Is everything closed today? Isn't there anyone here? Hey, I'm talking to you! That's it! A bit more to the right! Go, go! Keep going! Good! Keep it straight! Listen! Excuse me! - Go ahead. - What time's the flight? No flights today. The runway's closed. - No departures or arrivals? - Impossible, no flights! - When's the next flight? - We don't know, there's a storm! - Good morning, Mrs. Grasse. - Good morning. Thank you. Thank you. Joyce. Hello, Mayer. Joyce, you want to explode? Come on. Here's our precious guest. She gets more beautiful every day. Our Aphrodite. Where's our hunter? Wives are always the last to know. Do you really think Alex and Ali? Your breakfast, madam. Aren't you staying for lunch? - The consul... - What? No, tell him I can't today. Lady! Your scarf, Mrs. Grasse. It's too much. - $100? I can't. - Why? What is it? Not enough? What are you looking at? Is it the first time you've seen a car? Come on, pull it out! Help me! Don't do that! Stop it! Where did you pop out from? Come on, children, get off. Leave it alone. Go home, go. Come on, go away. You as well, come here. Come on, behave. Go away. Go home! Leave it alone! That's enough! Go away! Here's your teacher, come on. It's very kind of you, thank you. Murderer! He tried to hit me, but I'll leave him. - Lady, take it. - Why are you spying on me? What do you want? I don't want to see you anymore, go away! It's for Alexander, lady. I promised him. Please take it, Mrs. Grasse. I received your tape incredibly late. So you never really answer my questions. Joyce, I don't want you to delay the flight anymore. You promised me you'd arrive... ...almost forgotten what you look like. You know I don't have a decent photo of you to enlarge. I've taken some great shots of the desert with Ali. You're not upset about what I said about Paco? I was just alluding to the way he talks about you. But that isn't a good reason to fire... I had a dream yesterday. Do I have to tell you about it? No, I won't tell you. Your mother called this morning. I was polite to her. My dress is dirty. I have to change. Come. Come in. Have you ever kissed a woman? Never? Wouldn't you like to try? Do you feel how sweet it is? My mouth. Come on, try. Come. Kiss me. Are you scared? I can help you. Look at me. You must look at me. I won't tell Alex. I won't say a word to him. Give me your hand. Do something. Get out! Go away! Hello? No. I haven't run away. Eat out? No, not tonight. Maybe another time. Goodbye. Hello? The Atlas Clinic. Doctor Volterra. It's Mrs. Grasse. The architect's wife! How can you not know where he is? No, it doesn't matter. I'll call back. Good day. - Who is it? - Volterra. Good evening, Joyce. I heard you were looking for me. Yes, but I didn't actually think... I thought you wanted to see me straight away. Everyone's sick today. It's suffocating. This wind has ruined our weekend. It's a hard life being a doctor. - Would you like something to drink? - Yes, thanks. Whiskey, neat. I'll join you. You look pale. Impossible, I feel like I'm burning. We have an incredible summer. Where are you going to spend the summer? It depends. We still haven't decided. Are you better now? I'm surviving. There's a problem with the electrics. I can't stand it in here anymore. A sense of panic? Yes. It's like I'm at the bottom of a well. Take a deep breath. And again. Better? A bit. Lie down. It's not just the heat. We'll see. I keep having these dreams. If you speak while I've got these on I can't hear anything. You were saying. What does dreaming of a snake mean? What was it like? It wears glasses. And when it leaves it sheds its skin. My dear Joyce, lots of people wear glasses. It tempts me. I swear. It presses on my stomach. Does it look like someone? Your snake, I mean. Promise you won't laugh if I tell you. No, of course not. Alex. Well? Half the city's in the same state as you. - Doctor. - Yes? I want to come to the clinic. I can't sleep here. I'm leaving first thing in the morning anyway. Where's Alexander? He's gone hunting with the consul. With Mayer? Great idea in this weather! I'm ready. What is it? I thought you were made of steel. Me too. But everyone sees you differently. Who? Everyone? Alex's friends. I defend myself, it isn't easy being the wife of someone like Alex. He works too much. We'd better take my car. May I? Let me try. The keys. I'm just keeping you informed, consul. Whenever you like. I'm at your disposal. Say hello to Mrs. Mayer. See you soon. Come in! - I don't wish to be disturbed. - Okay, doctor. Hello. Come in. - Your dinner. - So early? - It's still light. - We have a schedule. If the lady doesn't want to eat now she can do whatever she wants. She isn't a patient. She's just a guest for the night. I fell asleep. Run a hot bath for her. Are you feeling better? Much better. It's just that... It came back. Yes, the one with the glasses. Strange things happen in a climate like this. I advise you to take a couple. They'll help you sleep. You're leaving, doctor? Everything's going to be okay. No, nothing. Goodnight. - Shall I make your bed? - Yes, thanks. - Do you need anything else? - No, thank you. These things happen. Don't worry. Please, I want to go home. Now why's that? Wouldn't you prefer to change room? A taxi. Can you call a taxi? I can take you. I was just about to leave. You can breathe. Let's hope we got a big downpour to calm everyone's nerves. Look at that, all this emptiness suddenly comes to life. I haven't felt like this for nine years. If you'd been here then. I was here. I mean, it's like I was here because Alex was here. It's all we talked about at home. For years. Always. The earthquake. The earthquake. Where are you taking me? Is there something you need to tell me? I'd say it's a beautiful day. It started terribly, a broken crossbow and a flat tyre. So we moved over to the second jeep. And we followed some tracks for a few miles. We finally spotted the pack. I jumped out of the jeep. And I let off a round in my haste. I almost killed Ali. The poor kid was injured. It's no fun being grazed by a bullet on the neck. We were both very excited. It was the first time I'd seen such a fine specimen. Alex! How far do you think it is? I asked Ali. 200 feet, he replied. So I said, I can't shoot it from where I am. Mrs. Grasse? Follow me. Come on, get up! Do you know him? I want to know his name. Ali. Come with me. Now you listen here. Have you ever kissed a woman? Never? Wouldn't you like to try? Do you feel how sweet it is? My mouth. Come on, try. Come. Kiss me. Are you scared? I can help you. Look at me. You must look at me. I won't tell Alex. I won't say a word to him. Give me your hand. Do something. Get out! Go away! Is it this one? Let her. Listen! Please get these photographers out of here. Quick, call an ambulance. Get back! Please, get back! Subtitled by Air Conditioner Stan August 2020
