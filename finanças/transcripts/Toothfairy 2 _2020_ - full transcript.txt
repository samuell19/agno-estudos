Tammy, bed time. Shut the phone off, okay? Mum? Whoa, Corey, don't have a heart attack! Christ Edgar, what the hell are you playing at? There, that's a bit dark, isn't it? I thought you did illustrations for kids books. Why do you want to do that? That was really good. Look, I'm just busy, mate. That was just a doodle, I'm trying to focus on this latest commission. I preferred the other with the bag of stones. Those were teeth. Teeth? Well, that's twisted. Anyway, all set for the big weekend? To be honest, Edgar, I've got so much to do. Don't back out on us, Corey. Look, everyone else is going, the whole gang from uni. When I say the whole gang, I mean the whole gang. Jess will be there. She confirmed? Yes and... What? She asked about you. So? She asked about me, so what? Mate, just come. For the love of god, just suck up and get things going with her. This is a second chance. It's now or never. You can have that one for free, buddy. Hey man. Uh, yeah. I'm in, okay? Uh, Jess. Corey. Oh my god, it's been so long! I know, you just got here. I got here a while ago with Hazel and Jo. Can I help? Yeah sure, thanks. How have you been? Fine, I actually moved back a few years ago now. I missed it. I heard through the grapevine. You like it? Yeah! It's not quite the same tranquil surroundings as Marcom International Academy though. I guess. Hazel and Jo flew in the other day. I hear you're still good friends with Edgar. For my sins. Do you still see Paul? Oh, I never understood that. You guys knew each other as young kids. And you were the only two English boys in our group. Guess we weren't obligated to like each other? I've missed you. We had some good talks back at uni. And you weren't just drunk the whole time like the other guys. Ed told me you live in London now. We should stay in touch after this weekend, Corey. I'd like that. Catch you in a sec. So you still hate his guts? Yep. No offense dude, but I just don't get it. What is it about the guy you don't like? I knew him as a kid. You ever hear of the tooth murders about 20 years ago? Rings a bell. What happened? Some crazy asshole killed a load of people. Ripped out their teeth. Happened not far from here. He's obviously some kind of nutcase, although some locals, being quite a superstitious area, thought that it was actually some kind of demonic tooth fairy. So, what? Not human? Hell knows. All these people murdered, including my cousin. And he, his aunt, and his stepdad somehow got away. Never understood how they escaped. There was always something odd about that to me. This horrific serial killer the police couldn't stop and somehow they escaped. That's grim. So, you think he's somehow involved? Or his family? Who knows? They were reclusive. Moved away not long after she ended up in a nuthouse, and his stepdad pissed off abroad. I tried to talk to Corey a number of times about it in passing during freshers week at uni. He just kept playing dumb. I don't care, he'll get what's coming to him, don't you worry, I flicked through this, it's go incantations, rituals. Tooth Fairy's gonna make a little appearance. We'll fuck with him a bit, play it off like a fun game. But him, I want it to haunt him. That's a bit much, buddy. Are you gonna help out what? I guess. Good. I'll run you through the plan, and we go in and play nice tonight is my idea, then execute the plan. There you are! Here you go. Thank you. And something stronger. Go on. Hold on. Hey! Guys, look who I've just found. Oh hi. You're a star. Hey, how are you? Shall we toast now or wait for the others? And for you, get that down you. Have you got a drink here, Jo? Oh perfect. Were you away recently? Yeah I was in earlier, I was in earlier, yeah. Get over here. How was your journey? Yeah not bad. Like two hours. Looking great as always ladies. Hey man, good to see you man. Hey. Good to see you. Come here you big lug. Get a drink. You doing well? Uh, good yeah. You? I'm great. So we toasting or what, Edgar? Yeah. Well, I'm glad to see everyone here, I hope we all last the weekend. It's been too long, so here's to Marcom International Academy, dorm five, alumni 2014. America's finest and the Brits of course. Woo! You okay, Corey? Corey, can I come in? Are you okay? Dig in, boys and girls. Soak up the hangover. Where's Hazel and Corey? Little the worse for wear, I think. Oh. Oh my god, that's awful. Horrific. What is it? Five people were murdered last night down Leon house. Two little boys and their family. That's awful. I can't believe this happens around here. I know. How about a little game tonight then guys? Lighten the mood. A game? What? I've got a book on local myths and legends. It's full of incantations, spells and stuff. Let's summon the Tooth Fairy. ...Oooh, the Tooth Fairy! Don't be stupid, Paul. It's a silly local legend, it's bollocks. Let's just do it for a laugh. Remember the Ouija board night we had? Hazel thought we'd summon a ghost, turns out we just had rats in the bloody wall. Oh my god I remember the rats, that was so funny. Shall we? Could be fun. Believe me ladies, after a few beers it'll be a laugh riot. I'm game. Me too. Yeah, me too. Awesome. I'm sure the sleeping beauties upstairs will be up for it. Yeah. Yeah nice nice, okay. Yep. No no don't bring that no. Oh yeah yeah. All right, nice, that's the plan. Yeah, be ready. Hello, Corey. Give thy tooth. Jesus Christ, Corey. You terrified us. Guys, can we have a moment please? How many fingers am I holding up? Two. Look, I'm fine. Okay, well I'm keeping a close eye. Anything else happens and I'm calling the ambulance. Okay. I just wanna enjoy the rest of the weekend. Get involved a bit more. I dunno, Paul's got something odd planned for tonight. What? Yeah, we're going to summon the tooth fairy apparently. Won't be able to last a weekend. Hey. You guys want anything in town? We're doing a booze run. Just booze, lots of booze. Anyone else? Chocolate. Noted. Booze and chocolate, gotcha. We'll be a couple of hours. Let's go. You guys remember that Easter party we had back in second year? Oh god, please don't remind me. Hazel, tell me something, when you're deep into a weekend drinkathon, how come you always get chocolate cravings? You literally blitzed through two chocolate eggs. Never a good idea after a night and morning of pounding shots. After the results of Hazel's barf, I haven't been able to look at a chocolate fountain since. Yo, Corey. Get in here and sit yourself down. What about Christmas in second year? Now that really was a disaster. Oh stop. I can't believe we missed out on ball tickets and ended up raving at the community center. I know. Ed is still to tell us whether he went home with that woman who was double his age. Triple. I can neither confirm nor deny. I need something you can collect for me. Leave him alone. He is mental. We have to tell the others. Forget it. Don't go spoiling the rest of the weekend. We're not going to see him again after tomorrow. I promise, after tomorrow, I'll call Jess up and tell her. Come on. Listen, can I ask you something? Sure. You're not on drugs, are you? No. I just need to lie down for an hour. A man of few words, Ray, but buddy, you can cook. To Ray. To Ray. So Corey, you're an artist. Yeah. Yeah, my nephew reads one of the books you did the artwork for. That's cool. Pays the bills. What are you doing these days, Jess? I'm a stock analyst. Raking in the big bucks. Yep. And boring my ass off in the process. What about you, Eddie? Guess. I think you're an estate agent. Any advance on that? It's something like that or you're a car salesman. Yeah I'll say an estate agent. Dude, tell her what I do. He's an estate agent. So me and Hazel, we've opened up our own boutique clothing shop. Oh! Why doesn't it surprise me that you two work together. Hello, Corey. Are you okay? Corey? It's me. I need to lie down. I'll be fine. Stay here, enjoy yourself. Corey! Leave me alone. I'm fine. Here he is. You feeling better? I feel okay. Cheers. Right then. Who's ready to raise a demon? Come on then. Over you come then Corey, over you come. Do you definitely want to do this? Yeah. Are we all ready? Hang on. Right, now I'm ready. Let's begin. Everyone hold hands. Close your eyes. I've come to collect. Corey, what is it? Something's not right. Jess? Yeah? Nothing. Was that it? Yeah, we've unleashed a demon. What's going on? I'll get it. No, I'll go. What the hell's going on? No signal, getting no signal. No signal either What the hell's going on? You stay with the girls, don't let anyone in. Me and Corey will go and help Ray. He's probably still alive. You with me Corey? There's a shed with some bats and some crowbars, let's arm ourselves. Where is it? Wait here. Weapons, Corey. Go get the weapons. Go! What's going on? What's going on? I don't know. Still no signal. Let's just take one of the cars and go. But what about the others? To hell with them! Just shut up! Stop! Who are you? I'm Danielle. I'm Paul's cousin. Someone just passed the window. Ray? Ray, what the hell's going on? You total asshole! What's going on? It was a prank. A prank? A prank? I nearly had a heart attack Where's Corey and Paul? Corey ran off into the south field and Paul's gone to get him. He ran off? I have to go and find him. No no wait a little bit. It's no use, everyone going to get lost. I'm going! Let's give it 10 minutes. Corey's well up tight, but once he calms down he'll be all right. Nice of him to abandon us all. Shut the hell up, Hazel. What do you want, Paul? Well, you exceeded my expectations, good work. Thanks, that was fun. Uh, money? Oh yeah. There's an envelope in the glovebox of my car with your money in. Go grab it, introduce yourself to the house and have a few drinks. Cheers. Let's go find them. No, I'll go. Wait. What? I'll go with you. No, watch the women. Watch the women? You lot can do what you like, we're going to get more booze. Come on, Haze. Answer me, Paul. Answer me! What do you want? Help! Help! I'm only here for me. Don't waste your breath. You think I'll go to the police? I don't give a shit. I just want something from you. What do you want? The truth. Damn, we're running low. Think there's a box of unused bottles outside. Catch you in a sec. Do you hear that? Yes. God! Don't sneak up on me like that. Did you get the booze? No. Alcohol is bad for the teeth. What? You should go with the others. I need to check outside again. What is up with you? Go with the others. I'll go get the alcoholic beverages. Did you take something? I will soon. What's going on, Ray? Ray? Why don't you want us looking? You better tell me, Ray, or I'm going to stick this into some part of your anatomy. It was Paul's idea. Where are they? The shed. Wait, what the hell's going on? It's just part of the joke, nothing's happening. I want you to take me back to a night 20 years ago. People were killed, a serial killer, that couldn't be stopped until they burned themselves alive. Not before killing my cousin. I don't know what you're talking about. Yes you do. Of all people, why was it you and your family that survived? What made you so special? Why you? What are you looking at? She's not real. Who's not real? Maybe you are crazy. Just let me go, Paul. You'll see me somewhere. Please. That's Paul's car isn't it? Someone's in the front seat. Yeah, I think it's Paul. Maybe. Should we go and look? We probably should. After you. Who are you? Who are you? It's in you somewhere. The truth is in you. Blood for blood, Corey. I can't get the scum who took my cousin, so you're accountable. Tell me what happened. Who is the Tooth Fairy? I was just gonna take out one from the back. But you know what? Now I'm taking one from the front. I'm the Tooth Fairy tonight, Corey. Me! You act strange. You always have done. Maybe you don't believe you're crazy. I have a confession to make, Corey. I'm worse. Corey? Is that you? That's not Corey. Shit. Quick, get out of here. Dead! She's dead! Who? Some woman, I don't even know who she is. Danielle, Paul's friend. Where did you disappear to, Hazel? What are you talking about, I was in the kitchen, I'm literally just done. What is wrong with you? You just followed me out there. I didn't go outside. You were in the kitchen talking to me, you're crazy. Girls. What on earth is going on? If I didn't see you in the kitchen, then who was it? Where's everyone else? Paul's dead. I don't know what's happening. It's the Tooth Fairy, I've just seen it! No! The Tooth Fairy doesn't exist. The girl's teeth were all ripped out, Ray. And Paul's. His whole jaw and teeth were ripped out. Where's Corey? We haven't found him. Tooth Fairy isn't real. So what is it then? Who is it? Corey ain't here. Don't be ridiculous. He probably ran off because you two idiots terrorized him. We seen Corey earlier, Jess. Me and Hazel. So? He was acting really weird. Talking to himself, having a complete meltdown. What? Why didn't you tell me this before? Because he's a creep. He's always been creepy. He's a nut job. Do you know anything about his history? 20 years ago? What history? He's involved. People died, including Paul's cousin. He's a freak. That doesn't make him a killer. Edgar, you know him better than anyone, why aren't you saying anything? It's nothing. Maybe it's just... What? Spit it out, Edgar. This is important. I saw him a couple of days ago. He'd been sketching something out, a monster of some kind. I didn't think much of it until now but he'd drawn it carrying a bag of teeth. Well that's it, he's flipped. Wake up, Jess! He's a psycho. Whatever is out there, whoever, we need to get out, grab the car and go. Paul's car's dead. Well we'll take mine, go to town, call the police. Jess. How can you explain the fact Hazel and Jo saw each other when they weren't even there? Everyone's running around scared. Probably just in shock. Yeah. Come on. Give thy tooth. I really don't want to do this. It's okay, it's okay. I can't see anything. Stay alert ladies, keep an eye. Keep a look out while I start her up. Sure. Shit! What's that? It's nothing. What's taking so long? I don't know. What's happening? I can't believe it. No no no. What's happening, Ed? It's been tampered with. We'd better go back and tell them. We'd best get back to the house too. Sure. So now what? Can we check the other car? If he's tampered with one, he's tampered with them all. I say we make a run for it. Don't let him in, Ray. You can't be sure, what if he needs our help? He's a murderer. We don't know that. Edgar! Ray, he will kill us. Please no, Ray, he's crazy. We need to let him in. Fine. Ed, get ready. When he comes in, get ready to take him. Let me go! Let me go! Help me, Jess. Why'd you do that? I'm not taking no chances. Calm down you two, help me get him to the shed. This is wrong. Jess, until we know exactly what's happening or who might be out there, he's safe here. Okay here's my suggestion, we go back to town together, send the police to pick up Corey. If he's innocent their investigation will prove he's innocent and eliminate him from the murder inquiry. And if he is then there's still somebody out there. Well, I'm going. I'm staying. Hell yeah I'm going. I've had it up to here with this place. Let's get out of this hellhole. Ray? I'm staying. We can lock ourselves in. If you want my honest opinion, I'm 100% certain that we've got this killer locked up. I mean, it's true, right. if it looks like a dog and it smells like a dog, then it's a damn dog. I'm staying. I'm gonna pour myself a drink and I'm gonna take a shower. Fine. Josephine, Hazel, we're going. It'll take us an hour if we cut through the back fields along the farm, okay? Cool, let's go. Stay safe out there. Yeah, you too. I'm gonna tidy up. Fine. Leave him alone, Jess. I'm having a drink. I need to stop. When we get as far away as we can. Ed please, we need to stop. Come on, come on. We're going to make it, please just stop. We're gonna head straight to the cops. They can lock that psychopath up and throw away the key. As soon as we get there we need to demand to speak to someone and get them sent straight to the house. Can we stop talking about the Tooth Fairy, then they're going to think we're all crazy. No, Corey's behind this, that's all they need to know. We don't need to start talking about this Tooth Fairy crap. It was insane, I don't know what happened. I can't believe I made him come. I invited him. This is not your fault, Edgar. You weren't to know what he's really like. I've known him for so long. I never thought he'd be capable of this. You weren't to know, Edgar. Strange is one thing, but a killer. I feel so guilty. No please. We should have said something earlier, we seen that he was messed up. Oh we can... Gun. Gun, Corey. You want to live? What? Give me an offering or I will take them all. Another Can I go now? Another. Right after I take the rest. Just let me, just let me go. Corey, I'm, I'm sorry. I'm just sorry okay? Ray? I'll be right down. I'm just cleaning my teeth, we can have fun soon. Fun? Yeah, we can be like the others. Come and play. Where are the other guys? They perished. Ray didn't make it. Let's take the road up this way. That's away from the cottage. You wish to go back? Edgar, you and I both know that Corey is innocent. He's locked up in that house, we need to go back and get him now. Go. I'll catch you later. Edgar? Edgar! You coward! Corey! Corey, no. Corey, please. I came back to get you out. Corey, where did you get that gun? I just found it. Corey, it's me. It's Jess. Come to collect. It's Jess. What's wrong? Your time will come, Corey. Corey, what's wrong? It's your destiny. No! I'm gonna put the gun down. Just calm yourself, okay? Jess? Yes yes yes yes. Come on, Corey. It wasn't me. I didn't do it. I know, I know. I know, I never doubted you. We have to get this thing, okay? It's gonna all right. What are you looking for? Sugar. Anything sweet, it seems to repel her. Okay. How do we kill it? I don't know. Paul's book. What? The incantation actually worked. If there's something to unleash her, maybe there's something to stop her. Maybe. I know where it is. There it is. Okay, it must be here somewhere. Corey, concentrate. This is the incantation page, so here's the summoning. This is it, The Collector. Collector? We have to summon another demon. What? The Collector: a demon who collects escaped demons who have stayed too long in the mortal realm. If we bring him here, he'll bring her back to hell, it's the only way. Be careful. Let's go. Corey, Corey. Go, go! Take the book. Let me in. Please, Jess, it's Corey. It's over. It's over. You can collect for me. This is your destiny. Corey?
