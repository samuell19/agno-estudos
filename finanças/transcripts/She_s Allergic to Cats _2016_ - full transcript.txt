What do you think? Uh... Okay, Michael. I... I do not know where to begin. Uh. Remind me what what is this Carrie? Is this a popular television show? A cartoon character? - What is this? - No. It's... It's a famous horror movie, from the 1970s? Based on a book by Stephen King? No, okay. All right, let me explain it to you. It's... There's... It takes place in this small town... and there's this girl with powers... and her mother, and they live together. - I will look it up. - No. Sebastian, you don't have to look it up. K-A-R-Y? Kary? - Kary? - No, with a C. - All right. - Boom, got it. 1978 supernatural horror film, - yeah? - Yeah. Stephen King. Good, got this right. and then you said... telekinesis is in here. Okay, right. Yeah, I get it. So... What? Demon cats, you're saying? No. No, it's not demon cats, it's just... It's... It's this prom scene, with pig's blood and... Okay. Uh, well, Michael, as your producer, I'm going to advise you that this is a terrible, terrible idea. And, I do not think you should do it. Hi, Mom. Yeah. Uh, I'm doing good. Mm-hm, the meeting with Sebastian went really well. I think he's really into it. So, now we just gotta present it to the band and... Stuff's happening. Is it supposed to bleed? Is it supposed to bleed? Huh? When you're cutting their nails, is it supposed to bleed that much? Not really, I'm... I'm just not very good at this sort of thing. Hmm. Well, what are you good at, then? I don't know. Obscure movie trivia, making weird video art that nobody wants to watch. I'd watch your video art. Really? Yeah. Thanks. - Right now. - Okay. There we go. There we go. Okay, let me get the, uh... - Come on. - You got it. Happy Fourth of July, son. Rick! Okay, where's food? Here. Hi. This is Honey Davis. Hollywood street musician and property owner. I'm recording my next big single right now, so please leave me a message after the beep, and I'll get right back to you. Hi, Honey. It's Michael, your tenant. I'm still having the problem with the rat infestation. Michael. You are distracted. Pay attention to your work. I can train you to be a good groomer. A doggy stylist to the stars. Sound good, huh? But you're not there yet. Your work's still sloppy, lazy, and disinterested even. Example... this Shar-Pei, Beatrice, you did not wash out the excess colloidal oatmeal conditioner. You see her hind legs? They're as slick as a monkey's back. You must bathe her again. Michael... I like you. I really do. But your imperfections benefit no one. Hey, Honey! Honey! Honey, wait up! Honey. I'm glad I caught up to you I... I just left a message on your machine. Did you get it? I haven't checked 'em yet. I have a gig right now, on Hollywood Boulevard. Okay. In the message, I was talking about how I'm still having trouble with the... the rat problem. Well. Uh. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll get on the web, and I'll I look on Wikipedia and some other sites, and I'll find out what we're supposed to do. Yeah. You know, but like, research is great and all, but it's just... it's getting really bad. Last night, they ate my bananas. A whole bunch. The dog is lost. The dog is lost. The dog... is lost. The dog... is lost. The dog is lost. The dog... is lost. The dog... - the dog is.... - Is found, found. Everyone is a lost dog. Hi, Cora. This is Michael, from Tailwaggers. Yeah, I've been thinking about you too. I was... Thinkin' that maybe we could go out... sometime and... I could take you out, yeah? Yeah. I'd like that. Tomorrow night. Let's meet at your place. Gina! You move so fast. What's it feel like to move that fast? Feels like flying. Gina, ride around me in a circle, as close as you can, okay? Okay. Faster, Gina! Faster! Faster! Faster, Gina. Now, jump over me, Gina. Jump over me, Gina! That was so great. I was so scared. - Were you scared? - Not once. Oh, I don't believe you. Uh. Put your face up against the plastic. What for? I did what you wanted me to do, now do it. ♪ Come inside ♪ ♪ Come inside with me ♪ ♪ You will be mine ♪ ♪ Eternally ♪ ♪ There will be nowhere ♪ ♪ To hide ♪ So, please leave me a message after the beep, and I'll get right back to you. I think it's time we move on to the next phase. I'm not really sure what that is, but, we should discuss options, talk about the rats. See what ideas we come up with. So, give me a call when you can, please? Thanks. Menstruating demon cats? This is not appealing to girls, Michael. If you're going to make your art, at least make something that will, you know, get you laid. Service! You know, I'm trying to make something that matters. And for your information, I have a date tonight. No. - Yeah. - Really? Yeah, I'm gonna see this girl. Like, a real date? Yeah, she's a real date. And she's a real girl. Michael, this is amazing. How long has this been, now? Like, what? Two, three years since you have... That's not true, okay, I've just been really wrapped up in my work lately. Tell me more about this girl, Michael. What is she like? How are her breasts? Are they supple? How about her ass? How are those cheeks, are they... Tell me more about this girl you will fuck. I'm not gonna fuck her... I mean, I don't know if I'm gonna fuck her, I just know that I wanna hang out and see what happens. There may be a real relationship here. Michael, my friend. You are a giant pussy. Michael, I want to tell you about the best idea I've had in many, many years. It's a website. It will be called, Kaufmann Mercantile. A website devoted to the finer things in luxury living and menswear. We'll feature only the highest quality, carefully selected products. It's going to have a blog as well. We'll talk about product design, manufacturing and materials. I'm speaking with Jorgen tomorrow over some coffee to discuss a business plan. It's exciting, no? Sebastian, can I ask you a personal question? Yeah. Have you ever had... rats? What do you mean, like as a pet? No, I will not pick up rodent excrement. No, not like a pet. More like an infestation. Ugh. Really, Michael? This is terrible, it's disgusting. Why are you telling me this? Please, stop it. I thought I could confide in you. Michael, you are a filthy boy. Your life, it is really just, hopeless and very, very pathetic. I know this is harsh, but I say this to you because I'm your friend, Michael. And I care about you. You know, right? That you are just a giant, sad, dirty man-baby. Um, I know I gotta figure some things out, Yeah. You need to work it out now. Your "girl", your "love of your life, coming tonight, to your rat palace? You called an exterminator? No. I gotta do something about those rats. Oh, uh, amphetamines. Do you have some of this? I don't know. What are those, uppers? Yeah, uppers. I need uppers. - Have you heard of Adderall? - No. Great, get me some of those. - No, I can't... - Thanks, Michael! Hi. Mom. Yeah. Uh, I'm doing good. So, uh... I gotta get going, um. I've gotta get... myself organized, I have a date tonight. Yeah, she's really nice. She's Mickey Rourke's daughter's personal assistant. So, sometimes she brings Mickey Rourke's dogs into work. You're not very good at talking to girls, are you? I don't know. I mean, we're talking right now, right? I mean, are you good at talking to... Not to girls, but to guys? Well, I'm good at talking to the wrong ones. But, you don't seem that wrong, though. I guess not. Shouldn't you be watching what you're doing? You mean with the dog's nails? No, the driving. Your clutch just failed. What are you talking about? Don't you hear that noise, What noise? Oh, yeah, that. I guess I gotta get that fixed. I'll text you later. My name's Cora, by the way. Oh. Hey, Cora. I'm Michael. I gotta call AAA.

I'm real sorry about the message I left earlier, I was out of line. Just kinda, outta control. Look what I have in my hands. What is... is that a kitten? No, it's the cure to all your problems. - Huh. - Her name is Mo. Hm. Short for Mozilla. Oh, yeah? Is that... Is that like the web browser? No, not actually. More like the Japanese movie monsters. I wanted to name her either Mothra or Godzilla. Oh, yeah? So I combined them. Huh. She's a killer. Yeah. But these rats are vicious. They ate a hole in my laundry detergent and that's poisonous, so I'm pretty sure they're... mutant rats or something. Oh... Well, I'm sorry about your laundry detergent. And look, I'm really so sorry about your bananas. Yeah. I don't know. I just... think I could really fall for someone like you, Michael. You love dogs, which says a lot about a person. And you're so passionate about your art. You just seem like you really have your life together. Yeah. I'm gonna do something about those rats. ...do something about those rats. I'm gonna do something about those rats. Yes... ...do something about those rats. Yes... Nice. Very nice. Oh, wow. Fantastic hand control. For artistic perfection to be achieved, you must start... in the bath. And work its way out until the last follicle is trimmed. You must lather the organic almond crisp shampoo into the animal's very soul. Be sure to hit the pressure points as you run your hands against the sucker. Bask... in the pleasure of the blueberry facial. Knowing that only a clean dog is truly a happy dog. Express the anal glands. Not the most glamorous of the grooming experience, but a necessity nonetheless. It prevents an impacted gland that could lead to a rectum infection or a stinky carpet in the event of a self-expression. Dab a little coconut cool conditioner on the anus to relieve the smell. Yes. Yes. That is good. Perfection is everything. You ever groom a cat before? Usually, it's pretty easy. Except for that bitch. Scratched the shit out of my arms. Whoa. That troublemaker's got it coming, though. She's not getting picked up 'til Monday. Gonna have to stay in that cage all weekend. She can rot in there for all I care. Your girl, your love of your life, coming tonight, to your rat palace? He's the cure to all your problems. Yeah. I'm gonna do something about those rats. Hey, Rosemary. I don't really like cats. You guys seem to take everything a little too seriously. But that's why I respect you as actors. You know, I'm actually working on something right now, sort of a animal homage to Carrie, but, uh, we'll talk about that later. Well, Rosemary, I'm gonna make a deal with you. I'm gonna let you out of that cage, but you're gonna eat my rats. You're gonna kill my rats. You ready? Go kill. Go kill. Um... So, uh, - hey. - Hey. Uh. So, there's this dive bar that's, uh, in... within walking distance. They've got... sad clown paintings on the wall. - Do you wanna check... - Yes. Oh, okay. Uh, let's... So... Do you live alone or by yourself, or... I mean, yeah. Do I live alone? - Yeah. - Yeah. I don't need a bunch of roommates making a mess, you know? I make enough of a mess as it is. Not that my house is messy. - No. It's not. - No. I'm really clean, it's just, I don't need the clutter. You know, I read this article that, uh, that some amount of clutter is actually a good thing. You know, that, uh, really highly creative people, they keep clutter around... Mm. so that they see things that inspire them and that... sparks ideas. Yeah? What kind of ideas do you have, Michael? I... You know, I... Holy crap. That's the missing dog. That's, that's Karma. That's, that's, that's the missing... What dog? It's this dog, the... This lost dog. It was stolen by transvestites. There's an address on here. Let's take Karma home. - You want to? - Yeah. Come on, let's take her home. - Okay. - Okay. This guy's gonna be so happy when we get him back his Karma. Yeah. Ooh. I'm really happy right now. I'm happy being with you and the dog. And so, um... You know, I don't think this guy is home. We should probably just hang on to Karma ourselves. We could go back to my place, curl up with her, and... watch a movie or something. This is serious, Michael. I'm going in. I'm finding a way inside. I'm gonna jimmy open a window or something. I don't think that's a good idea. I mean, this is a house and you'd be breaking into it. That's breaking and entering. And we could get in a lot of trouble. I know. It's exciting, right? No. Okay. All right. Very gentle, and don't let go of her... - I got it. - ...at any moment. - I know, I won't. - Okay. That's a pretty cool hat. I think it's a hunting hat. That would make the guy that lives here, a hunter and those people tend to use excessive force when they find people trespassing on their shit. I think we should get out of here. I don't think anyone's home. Plus, I didn't see any guns. Let's explore! No, I don't... Whoa. What? His DVD collection. Milo and Otis. Hot to Trot. Congo. I fucking love this movie. It's terrible. Man, these are all... animal movies. Talking animal movies. I love talking animals. You know, I had a, a talking animal idea. Actually... the animals wouldn't even need to talk, they wouldn't have to. Just dressing them up in the right costumes would have been enough. I really wanted to recreate my favorite horror movie. But with cats. I hate cats. Yeah, it's probably a stupid idea anyway. Howard the Duck. This guy's got great taste. I've never seen it. Ah. It's a strange movie. There's this one part, at the beginning, on Howard's home planet, it used to make me feel really weird. 'Cause you see, this naked duck lady and that she's got these, these duck boobs. But, uh, it doesn't make any sense. Because... ducks don't have boobs. They're not mammals. They don't even breastfeed. When I was little, I lived... upstate, on a farm. There were goats, and chickens, and ducks. There weren't any other kids around, so, I would just play with animals. During the springtime, they would have... The ducks would have little ducklings. About a dozen or so. I never really been conscious of anything being younger than me. So in my mind, I was a duck mother. I felt responsible. So I decided to teach them how to swim. 'Cause ducks need to know how to swim, that's what they do. So I filled the kiddie pool up with water. And one at a time, I held each and every... duck... underwater. 'Til it could float all by itself. I spent a half-hour making sure that every single duck could swim. As I was holding the last duckling underwater... my mom saw me. Sitting in a pool of dead ducklings. I'll never forget the look on her face. I instantly knew... the secret to death... and its core of shame, Michael. Its dark and lonely shame. I know what you mean. I'm gonna put Karma down now. 'Cause right there it seemed like you wanted to kiss me. Maybe you didn't 'cause it would have been logistically difficult to make out with a girl holding a cute pug. So, I'm just gonna put Karma down now, okay? And then you can do whatever it was that you were gonna do. I was going to kiss you. Do you wanna go to that bar, still, or what? Mm. Not really. Yeah, me neither. Oh. You know, we could go back to my place. Watch a video. Mmm. Really? What kind of video did you have in mind? I don't know. I was thinking it would be nice to curl up with a bowl of bananas and watch Congo. Cora... To be honest with you, I... I don't have any bananas. I did, but, now, I don't. And even if I did, I don't own the movie Congo. Well, Michael. I just so happen to... borrow a copy from our good friend, Karma. Now all we need is a bowl of bananas. So. Welcome to my house. I'm so wet. Oh, uh, can I take your coat? Oh, god. Fuck. Oh, do you want, uh, something to drink, - a bottle of water? - Yeah, sure. Oh, great. All right, I can't find any, uh, cold bottled water, is room temperature okay? Yeah, that's fine. Thank you. Actually, I don't have any bottled water. Is soda all right? Yeah. - Hey. - Hey. These are the last two sodas. What's that? Uh, it's just gunk from the fridge. Oh. Oh, shit. Kiss my neck. Kiss my neck. Touch my boobs. Come on. Kiss my chest. That's right. Michael! Kiss my chest. Touch me. Touch me... No. Do you have any condoms? Yeah, one second. I just need... I just need to breathe for a second. All right, all right. All right, hold on. Hold on, one sec, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna get some water. Okay, just have a glass of water, all right? I'm sorry, Michael. I'm sorry.
