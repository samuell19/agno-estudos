Seven... I think it's almost seven years of living together. Plus five dating. Backwards and forwards. The good thing about getting old is that you never regret what you've done, because you never remember what you've done. Well, I remember very well. Very. She's wonderful. She's sweet, fun, a companion. And will give me my best present. Honestly, I never thought of breaking up with her. She's the love of my life, we've built everything together. Now, more than ever, I can say that it's forever. Funny. I'm very, very calm. A bit of nausea, eh? It's normal. Can I get a coffee? I didn't sleep at all last night. Ah, no way, no. Just thinking about coffee makes me sick. A bit of consideration, for the love of God. What does that cost? If we broke up? I think I would miss how calm he is, how lighthearted, the certainty with which he tells me that it'll be all right. I would miss the company, the affection... and the... Right... You don't say... Okay. It's fine... It's fine. Hug. Bye. - Hey. - Hey. Let's... eat in the lounge, Malka? I need to see the news. My student skipped the last class, so I decided to make a little something different for us. I used some delicacies... to make this pasta. Oregano? I added some. I added it to give a different touch. Miguel, I don't like oregano. No? How was the trip? We'll speak later, okay? Just let me see this. No, no, no, Miguel, stop, stop. No, I've worked all day, my love, I'm exhausted. Okay, the show was great, congratulations. - Just a quickie. - No. Tomorrow. I promise. Tomorrow. I have lots to do. No. Look! My things. - Ah... - "Tomorrow, tomorrow". That's all you can say, "tomorrow". You realize we didn't exchange a single word during dinner? And between news broadcasts, you... switched to news on another channel. The news are the same. Or do you think in a split second, there'll be a unique occurrence that only a reporter in the country can discover? Ah... You spent almost a week away, José. Didn't you miss me even a little? Aren't you the slightest bit interested in how my day was, how I am? Do you think such a relationship is healthy? I know you've been working yourself to death... José! Ah! Why do you have to scare people like that? Scare? I just entered my lounge. Exactly. Did something happen? No, nothing. I just arranged to speak with the boys on Skype. Look! That must be them. - Oh, my babies! - Hey! Hey, guys? - Speak, Baryshnikov. - Speak, rabbi. - Boys! - Can I speak? Speak, Dad. Very well, I called you to let you know that I was lucky enough to have two sons and sad that neither of them wants to continue with my business. I've decided to retire. What was that? I've had an offer to sell the textile plant and I thought this was the moment to change focus. - Nice, Daddy. - If you're happy... But the office? Me? How... We'll speak later, later. That's it, boys, go back to doing whatever highly important thing you're doing there. Bye, Dad. Bye, Mum. - Thanks, Mr. José. - Wait. Done. I think I need a drink. - At this time? - Now. I'll see if... I have whiskey in my room. Nine... One more, Dani, let's go. Ten! Nice, girl! That's it! - No, enough. No more. - Enough? No, there's another series, let's go. Come on, come, come, it's ending. Go. I want to see. Just a moment, Dani. Come on, go. Don't stop. Two... Where are you? Where am I? In the gym, Roberta! Has something happened? What happened is you're lying. I saw that your student canceled the class today. Saw where? - On WhatsApp. - What? - You've touched my phone? - That doesn't matter now, right, Miguel? What matters is I saw that she's not there. Roberta, that message is from last week! How can you be so childish? - I have to hang up. - If you hang up, Miguel... I have to hang up! Dani, are you leaving? Tomorrow without fail! Hey. Hey. - Can you help me with something? - I... I can. - Which machine? - That one. Are you okay? Dr. Hamilton... Yes, yes. Sorry. It must be 100% cold. - What? - Your coffee. Ah... Take this one, I just got it. Thank you. To my new phase! To ours, José. To our new phase. Of course. To our new phase. But now, am I going to have to leave this office? Of course not, the structure will be the same for some time. Fabiana will continue, as normal. I'll miss her a lot. Her work. But tomorrow I'm signing my writ of emancipation. Tomorrow? Saturday? Saturday, but it's the only day that we could arrange, Malka. Life is hard. Do you think my day to day is as calm as yours? So calm, my day to day, so calm. You're right. But from tomorrow mine will be too. What are you going to do now, José? I don't have a clue. Isn't it great? So, you're a marriage counselor? No, I'm a secretary, but Malka is a great therapist. - Cool. - Why? Is your marriage in crisis? No. It's good. Good. I'll give you my card, call me if you need anything. At any time. For whatever you need. Really? Wonderful. We need to talk. Sit a little, Roberta. - Now? Let me change first. - We need to talk. We never can, we never have time, but we must. Life is busy. Do you think it's easy to handle all this here? I don't work? You think it's not busy for me? But your job is... Roberta! Get back here! My job is what? Speak! Nothing, leave it, Miguel. Do you see how ridiculous you are? Because you understand numbers you think you're better than others. Let me tell you something: Nobody cares about statistics. Nobody you know, eh, Miguel? Statistics make the world go round. Ah, of course, clearly. If it weren't for you and your nerdy friends... Boom! The world would end. And if it weren't for you and your lovely students, the world's beauty standards would be 50% more interesting. I don't know what's worse, your arrogance or your jealousy. - Jealousy of what? - Of me. Of my job. Roberta... I don't want to be married to a woman like that. Then find another. The muscular one, for example. There's no point speaking to you. You know what, Miguel? I'm tired, you know? What's new, huh? I'm being serious. I don't think there's anything left for us. Wanna break up? What do you propose? Time. We need more time for us, Roberta. Just us. Impossible. Impossible? Why? Let's travel, let's be together, just us two. We'll have a holiday now, we'll sort it and go. Okay. Promise? I promise. Do you love me? And do you love me? - A lot. - Really? How many percent? José. - Do you think I look all right? - You look great. Shall we have coffee? I need to go out. - Can I? - No, Roberta! - Please! - Please? Today is Saturday! For the love of God. Hang up. Just hang up. Roberta! Hey, Dr. Hamilton. - Damn! - I can speak, yes. I know, his thesis is about copulas for generalized distributions of extreme multidimensional values, right? I saw it. Very interesting. - Very interesting, wow. - I've been on some boards before. Wow, but an invitation from you is an honor. Monday after the holiday? - No, it's a bit short notice. - No, no! You're going to be away. No, I'm not planning anything. - Not planning anything? - I'm totally free. I can, I can. If it's important, we can always find a way. FIRST SESSION - Morning. How are you? - Hey. This is my wife, Roberta. We have a meeting arranged with Dr. Malka. Of course. - Just a moment. - Thanks. You can go in. Malka is coming. Thank you. Excuse me. Do you know each other, you and the secretary? No. Of course not. Statistically, if she had done this whole course, she wouldn't have time to meet anyone. Look here. Malka Stein, PhD. For what she covers, it could be PhE. PhZ. Funny, huh? - Whoa! - Stop, Miguel! I didn't mean to! - Good afternoon. - Afternoon. - How are you? - Well, thank you, and you? - Everything all right? - Everything's in perfect order. Please, sit. Excuse me. Right, I'll start. The issue is this: Do you know Dr. Hamilton of Souza Castro? He's like the pope of statistics and he's invited me to participate on a board for a masters thesis of a student of his. Yes, late notice, but the professor was sick, lucky me. What's the problem if we leave this trip for later? Will someone die? In life, we have to have a focus. Just 12% of people who start a career have a better result after some years than they had expected. - What's that? - She made it up. He wasn't like this. When we first met, he wanted to have a gym, to start a line of shakes. All right, the percentage of businesses started by a person without any kind of investment plan is small. But what did he have? Ambition. Now, after all this time, I find him lazy and selfish. I know. Typical husband. She promised me this trip, doctor. Promised me. A trip for us to be together, just us. It's hard, money's tight and we have things to do, but we agreed that this would be during this holiday. But no, this guy calls. Not this guy. Dr. Hamilton is a... You see, doctor? She cuts me off all the time. She doesn't let me speak. I've had enough of it. I know. Typical wife. I don't want to play the role of the sucker anymore. She doesn't value what I do, my work. I work hard, I give lessons... I'm a personal trainer and I'm always somewhere in the city, working. And I like what I do. It's not my fault that she doesn't like her work, which is boring. No, no, it's not. It's boring for you, since you're ignorant. You see? I don't want this anymore. I'm tired. If you're tired, I'm exhausted. Children? How are we going to have children if we don't get laid? It's true. At first, doctor, we screwed all the time. It was nonstop, we... We liked it, didn't we, Roberta? It's just, at some point, we decided it would only be once a week and on Sundays. - It's not like that. - Ah, you're right, it's not. Because it's been two Sundays since we did it. If she doesn't care for me, how will she care for a child? That's all wrong, okay? He could admire my efforts, respect me more, without always thinking of himself. There are no relationships like that, eh? There are. They last three months, maximum. That's why children's stories always end at the marriage ceremony. But if you're here, you want to give it a chance. What's that? It's my phone. Don't worry. You can answer. It's my husband, he knows I'm in an appointment. Look, how wonderful, he respects her things. I don't respect your things, Roberta? - How long have you been married? - It'll be thirty years. - Wow! - Wow. - Do you have children? - Two. But let's get back to you. I think that, with my method, it'll take five sessions. All of that? Too many? We thought you would be faster, since it's expensive, you know? Yes. Could it be resolved in two or three sessions? Look, I think in three thorough sessions we can do it. I need at least four more sessions. So, you need four and we need two. We'll pay for ours and you pay for yours. I'll leave you to think about what you really want so you can decide what you want to do. - We... - Sorry, we didn't mean to offend. No, you didn't offend me. You showed me that you're on the same side, which is a good start. I'll expect you next week at the same time? Excuse me. Thank you, Fabiana. It's good, right? Very. Pleasant, calm, sure of herself. Thirty years of marriage. But then she knows everything, right, Miguel? So it's easy. Her husband's lucky. As soon as you get this message, call me. - If it's not... - Hey! - Ah! - What is it, José? What on earth are you doing scaring people like that? What do you mean scaring? I said "hey". Exactly. Everything all right? Everything's in perfect order. And you? What? Why? Who were you speaking to? With Carlão. What did you do all day? I suppose nothing, eh? You called me out of desperation. I don't answer the phone during an appointment, unless it's urgent. But it was urgent. What? What happened with Benjamin? Did the kibbutz explode? Tell me! What happened to my baby? Speak to me! But you won't let me! First, your baby is a grownup. Second, Israel is safer than Morumbi. I called you because I wanted to ask... - It was something important. - What? I don't remember. I think you need to speak with Tiffany. Stop that. Do you still have that nonsense? Nonsense? Who helped you when Ray decided to attend dance school? It was Tiffany. Tiffany showed you that Daddy was being chauvinist, prejudiced and just because our son decided to live in San Francisco with his African friend Nabab... doesn't necessarily mean he's gay. No, of course not. José... Speak to Tiffany. Go on, talk about your real feelings. Tiffany, honestly, the only thing I'm feeling right now is constipation. Our anniversary is coming! Mine or yours? Ours. The pearl anniversary. What's that? Thirty years of marriage. Already? Wow, you're getting old, eh, Tiffany? This year I want to travel. Shall we? Ah, no. Stop with that. Crowded airport, delayed flight. You know how much a first class ticket is? You want to risk getting thrombosis from being squeezed into economy? Don't jinx it. Do as my father said: "Pretend you've already gone." Let's dine at the restaurant of the Hotel Bozzano. Again? We've been going to that restaurant for 200 years. That's what we're up to, right? 200 years of marriage. It has been the best restaurant for 200 years. I'm not interested. I want something different, I want something to remember the day. José, let's change. Come on! I'm asking. It's the armchair! I remember what I called to ask. What? When was it that you moved this armchair? It was time to have a child, right? Our family... - I think it will be awesome. - Yes, it will. Because I loved him, okay? I hoped that, with time, he'd start to mature, acknowledge my work with the children. My mother always told me: "Changing husband is like changing shiksa. You're just changing defects". I don't think that things will change that much. What? Hey? Coming and going. SECOND SESSION Beatriz. 73% of Beatrizes are strong, successful women. She made that up. And you? I dunno. João? He wants to be just one more, a common man. This choice says a lot, doesn't it? I don't know. He could have picked Paul, Joseph, Steve. As if my doll's going to speak English. It's not funny. He doesn't take me to any sophisticated places, you know? Go to a cool restaurant. No. Doctor, for me, simple things are enough. To make a tasty little dinner at home, flirt in peace. I don't care about going to the Hotel Bozzano restaurant. But I do! I want, like, work for that. But no, he thinks it's stupid. It's stupid to work like a camel and waste all that money on food, since it all ends up in the same place. Ah... - You know what you should do, Roberta? - What? To go to the park with me, to run, exercise, no? See if you raise your endorphin levels and become happy, you know? Gain muscle tone, tighten that butt. Are you saying my butt is soft? Your mother has a soft butt. What was that? This buzzer will indicate when it's time to... breathe. Can I take it home? - Miguel, talk about your in-laws. - Well... My parents live inland, far away. But not far enough. Really? Go on and tell her what your mum gave me on my birthday. What's the problem? A pet. It's a sweet thing. Sweet? His mum gave me a fish. - And you don't like fish? - I do. I do. In an aquarium, the sea, on a plate. She gave me a fish in a bottle of vodka. But it was empty. I mean, it had water in it. Of course, because she's very responsible and sweet too. Jerk! Go on. Tell her what you did with the fish. Say it, Roberta! I put it in a tank in the living room. And gave it the name Cow. She shows it to everyone who comes round. It's still there. Cow is tough. - Is that necessary? - As well as that... Her mum treats him like he's a baby. It's like he's ten years old when they're together. When he's with his sisters, well, you have to see it. She never taught Miguel to manage on his own. He was always the youngest, everything given to him, there you go. There what? A completely settled person. I'm settled? You never want to screw. I'm not talking about sex, Miguel. I'm talking about attitudes to life. Ah... Do you know why Roberta's like this, doctor? She takes after her mother. She doesn't drink at all. So damn boring, huh! Press it! It's clear that family is a point of conflict. Well, it would be a surprise if it wasn't. I want you to stop blaming each other and to tell João and Beatriz... how you're feeling. Is everything all right? Your call is being redirected to voicemail... Just a minute. What is it, José? I'm in an appointment! Finally! If it had been a heart attack, there'd be no time to resuscitate me. Where are my favorite flip-flops? You know? The ones we bought last year. I don't believe this! And I complained when you had to spend a week away. - What was that? - Nothing, José. The flip-flops are in the wardrobe, with your others, next to your shoes. - No, they're not. - Obviously they are. Look properly! Ah, I found them! But it's better to leave them next to the bed, you know? We'll talk about that later, okay? I'm hanging up! Selfish. Sorry. Let's see. Roberta, tell João how you feel about your marriage. I feel anger, frustration. I don't want to have to give up my things for anyone. And also... I want you to respect me and to put me first. Whoa, hang on. I'm not... João is an imaginary me. I don't put you first, Roberta? What is this rubbish? Last year I gave up going on a fitness cruise, to go with Roberta to a statistics conference in "Tibibipipoca" just to hear you speak! Now you see how seriously you take your job. - I don't believe you said that. - It's Ibitipoca. What do you think Miguel could do to improve your relationship? I want him to understand what I need to be happy, which might not be what he wants. To stop wearing flip-flops and cargo shorts, once in a while. To grow up and stop being such a crybaby. To take on the role of a husband, you know? To become a real man. And you, Miguel? That she was mute? I want her to be... generous, caring... to compliment me once in a while. Not just to point out when I do something wrong. That is, when she thinks I've done wrong. I say the same thing. - The same as what? - What? - I don't care for you? - Not as much as I would like. - Well, you're nothing like I like. - Well, find someone else. Are you seeing this ignorance? Well, I think we're wasting time here. And it's been a long time. Maybe I don't want to wait thirty years. - For what? - To realize it wasn't worth it. It's all the same, you know? You lost your spark long ago. Each day is the same thing: either he's giving lessons or he's lying on the sofa, in flip-flops and cargo shorts. I can't take any more. I want something different in my life. Extreme. Go bungee-jumping, who knows if the elastic will hold? Extreme. What I'm going to ask you to do at home is this: write down on a piece of paper two names of celebrities or characters that you think represent each other. Exchange lists and tell each other why you chose them. Let's see how one sees the other and what this has to do with who you really are. Therapy has to continue outside of here. Use the dolls. Without insults. We call it "working on the relationship." It needs work. If it was easy, there would be no need for aspirin. - It's all for today. - Thank God. - Thank you. - Thank you, doctor. See you later. But my favorite flip-flops weren't like that. Excuse me. I'll be leaving. You can go, I'm off too. It's a shame, eh? Mr. José won't be coming here anymore. You think so? I like him a lot, really. Fabiana, can I ask you something? - Of course. - Have you ever gone bungee-jumping? No, Jesus! I'd die of fear. But you just go there and jump. You know what's extreme? Really extreme is to sleep with the same person your whole life, have children, compromise. For that, yes, you really need courage. It's tiring, see? So tiring. I go to the gym every day after I leave. It's great to see people, there's a lot of great classes, to feel good. That's a good idea. Because if we don't care for ourselves, who will? Can I go? Sure. Excuse me. Malka, pick up! Fabiana! It's funny. We've worked together for so long and I know so little about you. Yes. It's always so busy, right? Are you dating? I'm going out with someone. That is, I was. But he's engaged. How lousy. Right. I don't want to talk about it. You're lucky. Mr. José is incredible. Well, onto the next one? No, that's enough for today. I think I'll be going. See you tomorrow. Start. Mónica? Who is Mónica? Mónica. From the "Turma da Mónica" series. You think you're the boss, you're assertive, bossy, and always in charge. Give me that. This game makes no sense. I want to know what you really think of me. Okay, Roberta? We agreed with the doctor, so that's how it goes. I can take it. Ah, well. Clark Kent? Yes. Why? I don't know. Tell me. Tell me, or you won't be sleeping here, you'll sleep in the lounge. Speak. Because... Because he wants to look like a nerd, but he's incredibly handsome. He's strong, charming. A bit silly, but... Good or bad, he's a superhero and he was always my favorite. Roberta, let me... - No, no, no! - Quickly! - You can't change it. - I just want to make... an adjustment. Celine Dion? Because you shout, see? And you're boring. Open yours. Garfield! I like it. "Because you're lazy and settled, Miguel". Right. But he's cute... and everyone loves him. I love you too, Roberta, you know that. It's late, it's late. What? You're going to stay there with that face? Everything has to be when you want it, is that it? Not when I want it, at the right time! I'm horny. Can't it be now? What's the problem? Miguel, you have to respect my wishes, my love. I don't believe that you're saying that. Why? Well, let's do something. I'm going to sleep! I won't say anything else. Okay? Wow, great decision. We're paying a fortune for a lady to make us understand each other and you don't want to talk. Speak to Beatriz, then. I can't, and you know why? Beatriz wants to study, to use the phone, to use the Internet a lot, to become the queen of the doll kingdom. It's just, she's going to do that all alone. - No, I'm listening. - Right. José, I'm going on the computer. To do what? Solitaire, to play solitaire. No, stay here with me. You know I don't like these kinds of films. That's some therapist, that Malka. Malka. What kind of name is that? You're speaking to yourself, you idiot. - You still call her doctor. - Idiot. - She's not even a doctor, you know? - I'll call her what I want. Why do you defend her the whole time? - I'm not defending her. - Yes you are! You're always implying that she's a good wife, that I could learn from her. You don't even know her. At least when her husband calls, she worries about him. At least her husband is a partner, who's interested in her stuff and isn't... Isn't what? Asking for stuff all the time. - Malka! - What? Let's have some tea. Make me some tea. Ah, I was worried. I thought it was something about the boys. At least she trusts him and doesn't have an jealousy crisis. Aren't you coming? Where? You know what, Miguel? I'm not going to ask a single thing about your work anymore. - Wonderful! - You don't need to tell me anything. - Great! - Great! Bad night. At the start it was normal, but now it's becoming strange. I'm very... Very horny. Before I had to insist, now she seems to be possessed. And nothing from you, right? What? It's nice, huh? Ha. With us, once in a while, we... We still fool around. More than once in a while. You can hardly walk. But I just have to lie down. THIRD SESSION Now let's talk about your sex life. How is it? - Okay. - Okay? Roberta! After their first year of marriage, 92% of couples have sex at most two times a week. That's with each other? Speak, doctor. Tell her. Does your husband leave you to it? Of course not. Why? She takes care of herself, everything's in the right place. Tell her how to be a real woman. Let's do this, Miguel. - Take... - Beatriz. Right. Tell Beatriz, calmly, how you feel about your sex life. Don't you see, Beatriz? Our sex life is shit! - Oh, is it? - Shit! That's right, it's shit, João. He's right. You never want to screw. And you never get tired of asking even if I'm not in the mood. And he doesn't make the slightest effort to be romantic. He burps and farts in front of me the whole time. I bet your husband doesn't. Tell him, tell him how it is to have a real husband. Apart from not seducing me anymore, there's zero romance, it's... "Sit here, sexy!" Ah, sexy isn't a compliment? Is that it? If you find her sexy and want her to sit here, what's the problem in saying "Hey, sexy, sit here"? - I think it's nice, caring. - But in her eyes, it's not. - We've lost the magic. - What magic? - The magic. - For the love of God, Roberta. The other day, we were there... It was nice, everything was right, we... I had already said that I loved her, suddenly... She stopped. She didn't even care. Now be smart, Roberta, because men who don't eat at home, eat elsewhere. - What was that? - Exactly! Doctor, tell me. How many couples have problems because the man cheated? Many. Everyone has limits. - You're chauvinistic! - It's not chauvinism. - It's not? - No, it's a fact! Women have the right as well. If the man is annoying and isn't trying to get it on, then women also have the right to... go for whoever they want, right, doctor? No. But that's not the way. Honestly, you can't live without sex. Sex is like going to the bathroom. - How romantic. - I'm romantic, yes. I am. - I say you're pretty, give you clothes. - Which you get at the gym. But I give them to you, so we can do things together. I don't know, run in the park, exercise. You need to exercise, to be firmer. Are you calling me saggy? Your mum is saggy! - Mind your tongue! - I say what I want, jerk. - Idiot! - Fuck you! - Fuck you too! - No, you! Why did you marry her? Good question. Very good question. - Well, answer. - Why? Because... Because she was beautiful. I mean, still is beautiful. Secure, intelligent. She was the one who most attracted attention at the gym. When she arrived, she hired me personally and things started, you know? - But now... - And you? What? - Roberta, what was that? - What? I don't believe you said that you married me because of my dick. And you say I'm not romantic. Doctor, who is right? - It doesn't matter who's right. - How come? What matters is if you're willing to make an effort to fix this relationship. Take his hand, Roberta. Tell me what you would miss the most if you were to break up. Wow. I don't think I've ever thought of that. - But you've threatened it often. - Think now. Okay. What would you miss? I think how calm he is. How lighthearted... how certain he makes me that everything will be all right. And you, Miguel? What would you miss if she were to leave? Roberta is my confidant. She... Has always been my friend. My best friend. I don't know, I think that... I would be totally lost. Separation is not the easiest solution. You can see. How do we know, then? How do we know when it's time to break up? When it's over? A woman went to speak to a great sage. She said that her husband was horrible, she couldn't stand living with him and asked: "Should I divorce him?" The sage answered: "No". She went away. Some months later, she returned, saying that her husband was even worse, wouldn't stop fighting with her and she asked again: "Should I divorce him?" And he said: "No." So the woman, angry, said: "How do you know that I shouldn't divorce him?" And the sage responded: "Because you're asking me". Divorce is not an option, it's the only way out when you stop asking. Marriages have many stages. There are stages when work takes over, when children arrive and women have many other responsibilities, there's even a moment where the man feels more vulnerable and doesn't want sex. No. No, that'll never happen. - Why not? - It won't happen. I'm telling you, it won't happen. If the guy doesn't want to screw, you can be sure: either he's with someone else, or the relationship is over, but the guy doesn't know how to leave. Is everything okay, doctor? Everything's in perfect order. What I'm going to say is a very important thing. Pay attention. One of the greatest secrets of marriage is masturbation. Ah, of course. - You have masturbated? - Erm, I have. Of course I have, I just don't like talking about it. To your therapist? There's no need for shame. And you? I have, nonstop. It's normal. I'm just a bit worried, because if I continue like this, I'm worried that at the end of the month I'll have RSI. Repetitive Strain Injury. Right, well I think that's enough for today. That's good. Don't forget the dolls. Here, Roberta, it's an opportunity to fantasize. João may not be Miguel, but... he will do well for our purposes. Thank you. - See you later, thanks. - See you then, thank you. Go on, it's green. What are you doing? Speak, José! What's happening? Are you okay? It's awful. I don't know what to do. What is it? I'm not... How can I say it? I'm not... working anymore. You're saying... I have the desire, you know that I've always been attracted to Malka, but... it won't get up. You think mine gets up? - Without help? - No? Of course not. Of course not. For a long time. You've done well. Lasted a while. But you take this here and your happiness will be right back. It's a miracle, José. As you see, I keep this in my wallet. You never know. No side effects? No dizziness? Tachycardia? There's some dizziness, tachycardia, but fuck it. Fuck it. Today he hasn't called all day. Right. When you need them, they're busy. When they're busy, they don't care. Ah... Eight. Malka, I hope you're ready. The sleeping giant is back. Model airplanes. That's just the first step. Next he'll want to buy a motorcycle, get a tattoo. Men at that age are dangerous. Women too. Aerobics. Pick up. Please, pick up. He wants to be young again? Well, then, he'll have to start chasing after me. Ah, such emotion, it's the first time. Doctor Malka. Hey, Miguel! You're exercising here? Well, I have to look after myself, eh? No way, you look great. - You work at this gym? - Every day in the afternoon. Excuse me. Well, you're in great hands with Isa, so anything you need, just let me know. - Thank you. - I'll be over here. You're welcome. Sorry... but Tiffany and I are going to have a conversation. Right, Tiffany? Right? Eh? Well... A scarf... José! Malka, stop creeping up like that. Like what? I said your name. Didn't I tell you not to make a mess? But you're a natural at that, eh? Is everything all right? Just a bit of tachycardia. We should go to the ER, it could be a heart attack. Where's the Isodril? Calm down, it's fine. It's fine. You're sure? What's Tiffany doing here? She... I was talking to her. Didn't you tell me to speak to her? I did. Really? Ah, how lovely, José. Maybe that's why you're nervous. You're not used to talking about your feelings? It must be that. You see they're not just little things? My method is very effective. Very, very. I'm going to go lay down a moment and think of what happened here. Your lust, your tenderness My legs brushing against yours Where I spill my verses In my shameless decency Whispered desires Discretely revealed Your body stiff with desire Your body stiff with desire FOURTH SESSION Right, since today is our penultimate day, it's time for some role play. Miguel is great at this. Roberta, you can be Miguel. Miguel, you can be her. Imagine yourself in thirty years. Miguel is retired. Roberta, no more children at home. You can start whenever you want. Ro, Ro... I'm hungry, Ro. Ro, where are you, Ro? Ro, where are my tablets? Ro, Ro! And because I don't have arms or legs, I can't move. And I'm a man, you will have to care for me your whole life, like a child, and I won't thank you for it, because you're doing no more than your duty, even earning more than me most of the time. You have to take care of the house, the children. No, I'm the man. I own the world! And yours too, of course. My turn? Get off me, Miguel! Stop bothering me! Stop asking me for things and demanding that I do things at the time you want, when you want! Don't think of doing anything without me, okay? Don't think of leaving me aside, okay? Also, where did you go last night, Miguel? There's obviously someone else! I don't want to screw, but I also don't want you to fuck anyone else. Thirty years! It's been thirty years and you don't want sex. That's normal, right? It must be. I treat you like a retard, but I'm not your mother, okay? I want to be left in peace, but I'm going to keep bossing you around until you understand what it is to be people! I don't want to change you. Just a little. Nobody changes, doctor. He's right, nobody changes. Right. A person, with some effort, could improve himself, but they can't want more from someone than he can give. The truth hurts... but it's a relief. What do you want? Who do you want? Are each other still enough? Painkillers. Roberta... where are you? I'm at home, making dinner. Where are you? No, I don't believe you're still at the university. I'm... No, it's not drama. I'm making din... I'm not making drama, Roberta. You... We agreed... Nobody can do that for you, is that it? Ah. No, it's fine, it's fine. I'll wait, I'm here waiting. Bye. Hello. You're not going to say hello? You fell out of bed. You're not going to speak to me, is that it? Miguel, don't forget today is our last session. I'm being serious. It's expensive, you know? I'm the one who's paying! 55 years of marriage, eh? And? And it's impossible, that in that whole time... Like what? You know it meant nothing to me. It was just once and it's gone. Look, seriously, there's no problem. I forgave you. That's why they say that women are more moral. After I had sex with my co-worker, it became easier to understand you. I traveled a lot, you know? But I always came home. I always came back to her, my love. I think you didn't understand the question well. It's fine. You know it didn't mean anything to me. It was one time. It's in the past. FIFTH SESSION - Good evening. - Good evening. Malka left already? I should be asking you, right? My appointment was at 7:30 pm, I was late because of traffic and I've been waiting almost five minutes. - That long? - Right. You are...? José, Malka's husband. - It's a pleasure. Roberta. - A pleasure. I've been imagining what you would be like. Are you disappointed? No, no, of course not. Look, I tried to call her cell phone, but it seems to be going off in there. But it's all dark and I didn't want to go in. I'll see. What's this? These two skeletons are Pedrão and Tiffany. Tiffany? It's some nonsense Malka made up. Nonsense? This here is Beatriz. She gave her to me. And this one on top of her... is João, Miguel's doll. It's obvious! Tiffany, you whore! I don't think this means anything. Look here, look at this jacket! This jacket here is Miguel's! I've been looking for it for weeks. You're not being a little bit paranoid? Paranoid? How? Don't you get it? They left these dolls here on purpose, for us to... To find? As soon as I saw her reaction when I told her the size of his... And Miguel, Miguel was all praise for her. "Malka, yeah, she's a real woman". They were talking at the gym. Malka's going to the gym? How could I be so stupid? Why didn't I notice sooner? Wait, it might just be a joke in poor taste. - Empty. She's gone. - With Miguel! Roberta and Miguel! She told me about you, she said you were boring and he was handsome. What? I'm going to contact the Medical Council! She's not a doctor. I'll... Ah, how stupid! Now I'll be just another statistic about heterosexual couples who break up because of male infidelity in a smaller space than the one spent dating. What? I screwed up as well. I really screwed up. But I love Miguel. And I was ready to change, you know? I even canceled my night classes just so we could spend more time together. And me? We've been married thirty years today. Thirty years! That's a lifetime. With time, things started to fade. With age... My God, a handsome, well-endowed young man. I never thought she'd have the courage. How disgraceful! Answer, it could be her! - If it's her, I want to speak. - It's not. No? Hello? Yes, yes, I made a reservation, but something came up. Unfortunately, I'll have to cancel, is that okay? Thank you very much, in any case. Good night. I had even prepared a surprise. We were going to eat at the Hotel Bozzano restaurant, then... Wow, it's my dream to eat at that restaurant. But Miguel never wanted to, he never took me. I don't believe this is happening to me. I don't believe it! I'm going. Hey. - Miguel? - I... I was here the whole time. I got here a bit before you both and I was dying to go to the bathroom. So I left the doll on the chair, went to the bathroom, when I was leaving, you were arriving so I decided to listen... to your conversation to see what you'd do. And I heard you say that you were sad, because you thought I... I was going out with the doctor. She's not a doctor! Whatever. What matters is that I heard that you wanted to drop your lessons tonight to look after us more. I love you, Miguel. I love you lots, too. Come here. Oh! Fabiana! What's going on here? Anyone? - Malka, where were you? - I'm asking the questions. What were you doing in the bathroom with our secretary? No, Malka, I was... With Miguel. Dani, are you leaving? Tomorrow without fail! Hey. So you're a marriage counselor? No, I'm a secretary. Excuse me, I have to go. It was a mistake, I know. But today, when I got here, it was just her. And she started threatening me, telling me she was going to find you and tell you everything. When I saw you arriving, I couldn't think of anything else, so I locked myself in the bathroom, together with her, which was a bad idea, I admit. Roberta, look at me. It was a mistake, forgive me. I don't know... I don't know if I can. I'm going to get some water. And you, where were you? I went to collect a package which arrived. What is that? Before you trade Tiffany for two 25-year-olds... These are Jessica and Stephanie. I like it. I'm going. No, wait there. Just a moment. When you were in here, I heard you say that you messed up badly. - I did? - You did. What did you do? This has never happened to me before. It's fine, it happens to everyone. Oh, my God. - And it was great! - What do you mean? Ah! We'll lose the reservation. Reservation? Don't say it's for the Bozzano! You wanted to go to that restaurant, right? What? That restaurant, you wanted to go. José... could you arrange a table at the restaurant for me and Roberta? - I can try. - Wait. No, Miguel, I don't know anymore. Roberta, please! Let's try. Let's start over. The restaurant is very expensive. - Oh, dear. José, you can... - Miguel! She wants to go to the restaurant, don't be stupid! Doctor, hang on, she's not saying that, she thinks one thing and says another. - Roberta, please. - It's fine, it's fine. I want to go, yes. This sort of thing is important to me. Let's start over. It's reserved. Shall we? Thank you. I'm just going to have some water. - Well, good luck. - Thank you. If you need me, you know where I am. - Thank you very much. - Congratulations on thirty years. Thank you. - Shall we? - Let's. What was that? The appointment. Fabiana ran off, but they need to pay for the appointment. What appointment? We didn't have an appointment. I was here at the arranged time. - We didn't sit down... - It's all fine. Here, look. We found out last night. Really. Now that life is becoming more calm, we were starting to travel, to go out... We're going to start all over again. But she wanted to get through it, too. Right. We didn't just expect it to work out the first time. But it's good, they grew up together. It's worth it, because we grow up with differences, we learn to deal with them. It's annoying, but she's right. Flexibility and patience. Perhaps that's the recipe. And sex. Did I not say laying down would work? You fine piece of ass! Good night. It must be through there. Malka! José! I thought we were having dinner earlier, but we have strawberries. To us? To us. Just us. I love you. I love you too. I'm not doing anything. Nobody's coming. Everything all right? Everything's... in perfect order. Malka dear, do you know where my hat is? Ah, found it.
