Subtitles by Renatinha Tankinha All of these aspects of myself, all of these thoughts, how do we heal them? How do I unify them? How do we create the way... ...to an eye? Every evil we experience in this world... ...is actually the world in perfect balance with itself. I'm only a vessel for your unfoldment. I'm only here for you. So, when a conflict arises at me, the universe then sends a runner to manifest that conflict... ...in a form that I can see, to deal with outside myself, to create the harmony that I've lost within me. But the fear, the fear of not having, the fear of not knowing, the fear of being left behind, the fear, the fear, the fear... Hardly leaves any room for love. Love is a reality. Love is the only reality. And I run from it. I run from the things that heal me, because I need to feel powerful. I need to feel validated. I need to give expression to these tears that I have inside. Because without them, who am I? Who am I? I'm an illusion. I'm not even here. - Mom? - It's not a great time, honey. I'm out with the girls. I don't know what he wants. Hang on, I'm finding out. - Honey, what's the problem? What happened? - I... I don't know. - What do you mean you don't know? - Um... a friend came over... What did you guys bring something? -No. Mom, just come home. Please. I... I need help. -We need one another so that we can get to that place of balance. If we knew what balance was, we would just achieve it. No. We have to feel our way like blind men walking in a vast room looking for the walls to hang on to, to feel so they can look for a way out. -Mom? Am I bad? -No. Of course not, honey. -Why did this happen, then? I'll explain when you're older. You'll listen to them and do what they say. Okay? -How long will I be there? -That depends on you. It's time you took responsibility for yourself. You'll have to choose your own path and follow it to the end. You have that key I gave you, right? - Yeah. - That's a good boy. -Welcome to the clinic. Your treatment awaits you. Please make yourself at home. And we want you to be happy. -Breathe in... ...breathe out. Close your eyes and think of your new self. A self without limits, that can create a new world where anything is possible. Breathe in... ...breathe out. Breathe in, ...breathe out. Your mind exists only in the form you are going to continue Breathe in, ...breathe out. Breathe in, ...breathe out. Breathe in, - -[speaker] Go ahead, this is your room. You may unpack if you wish. -The others.... why are they here? - -[speaker] They are all in their own journey Journeys a lot like yours. -Huh. - What happens here? - -[speaker] We are here to help. Once you select a path, you'll see. - What's that room? - Selection room. - [speaker]- When you are ready, you can select a path there. Once you make a choice, the treatment can begin. -Treatment? - [speaker]- Why don't you get some rest? You can meet the others later. - [voice-over] I created an Automaton. And then two. And then four. Until I was surrounded with them. And I call that reality. I could replicate anything that was already in existence... ...and call it my own. And feel powerful. It's almost as if I am lost in my own dreams. - [speaker]- Your trainers will be here soon. - How can I be your mother and not feel responsible? You're my son. I look in your face and find no other eyes but my own. I'd hoped that would have turned out different. I wanted you to be perfect. But I can't help but wonder is perfect something this world needs? No. Perfection is horrible. It will destroy us all. - What happened? My mother... -[speaker]- Tell me what's going on. - You have to tell me what's going on. - I don't... I don't... - [speaker]- We can't help you unless you open up. -I don't know. -[speaker]- The danger is still real. - Hi. - Were you...? - No, I was just... Um... - Sorry. I was just trying to find my room. Um... I'm guessing it's this? - What's your name? - Sarah. - Where are you from? - Me? I grew up pretty far away. - Do you feel out of place here? - No. I think everyone's on similar journeys. What about you? Where are you from? - Not too far away. My mom came here when she was younger and she thought they could... um... ...fix me. - Fix you? -I've been having these strange... visions - Hmm... have you made your selection yet? Not yet. - What are you waiting for to start your journey? I don't know. - You have to evolve past your [element] nature. You have to get to the next place if you want to get along here. -You're doing that? Evolving? - Yeah. Come with me. - When every space that we see is empty, there is a story being played out. There's a universe unfolding. Between two people, there may be thousands upon thousands of realities happening that they may not be aware of. - I need to make my selection. - Okay. Please hurry. You see, for those two people who see each other, they are vibrating at a... ...specific frequency. One that allows the other person to be manifested before them. But the true process, the one that brings them together, is so much more subtle. -Hey, check it out. Girls in outer space. [laughs] What's wrong? Come on, tell me. I can tell you're thinking. What's up? -I mean... you look so familiar. -You're weird. You know that? -[speaker]- You're putting her at risk. - Why are you here? - To fix this... this problem. Why haven't you chosen a path yet? Don't you remember what happened to your girlfriend? It was like I was... I was in a dream. - What did you see? -I was terrified. I had no control. I... I couldn't do anything. It was like I was on a ride I couldn't get off of. But at the same time, deep down, I liked it. And... and... and then I woke up. - [speaker]- Are you ready to be in treatment? You're endangering her. What will it do? Transgenic, enviable microbioonic implants will cure you. - [speaker]-This technology can mutate your perception and free you from your base programming. It's a choice you can make. You can become something better, something more refined, more evolved, but you have to act now. This miracle process will only work if you start your journey and allow it to take its course. - Are you ready? - Yes. -[speaker]-Good morning. Congratulations on starting your journey. Come closer. This is how your packages will be delivered. This is a personal process. You will earn [????] to upgrade yourself. Information. 1379. - Thank you. - Just follow the instructions. I'm here if you need help. Step one: remove the first item from the package. Step two, use the item to draw the specific lines. Step three: press the button. Step four use the item to penetrate. The pain will only be temporary. Step five, remove the absent from your body. Step six, take out the beautiful, unclean treatment. Apply the treatment in cavity. You are one step closer to completion of being pure. Wake up. Try to be free. -You chose a path. -Where were you? - I think you're great, but I think we should continue our transitions separately. I'm too far ahead of you, and I see you like a man sees a man. But I wish you well on your way. This is goodbye. Thanks for showing me my room. The Chrysalis is the people stage of the butterfly. Chrys√≥s is Greek for gold. It's called that because of the metallic gold color found in many butterflies. When the caterpillar is fully grown, Fuses itself like silk to a twig. Then the caterpillar skin comes off. Under this old skin is a hard covering. The chrysalis. - Hi. - Hi, mom. - Sorry I haven't called. - How are things going? - Are you happy? - Trying to be. Nothing's really changed yet, but I am committed to making it work. -Well, that's good. What kind of stuff are they having you do there? Mom, there's this girl here who... You would like her. Be careful, sweetheart. Take it easy. I am. Don't get too close. You meet anyone else there? Anyone that works there? There's this voice that talks to me through the intercom. I feel like this is my fault. Like I wasn't there enough. That's not true. Or maybe if... if I was a better mother... Mom, that's not-- This is already passed, just not yet. It's happening, but somewhere else. How do I reconcile that when things feel so real? So, who are you? Are you my adversary? Are you my enemy? Are you a thing that I must control? The way out is really the way in. And the deeper in that I go, the more free that I become. You are the person, you are the guide, you are the one that will lead me back to myself. In this great illusion of love, an object cannot exist without something else to reflect itself back onto itself. How's the boy? [????] I didn't hear you come in. Is everything on schedule? I think we are about to find out. He's grown so much since last time I saw him. He's becoming a man. I don't have much more time left. You will need to start the transfer soon. Yes, the right schedule. Sarah... Stay with me. It's not an option. I need you. You have to let me go. You can't follow me where I'm going. -It's not how it goes. -Please stay with me. I need you. Don't leave me, please. Don't. You are her, aren't you? I just need more time. I don't have any more time. Sorry. Here. Turn in. Look at me. In here. I can feel myself changing. My mind is becoming less numb. I need to release my soul. I want to know every detail about your entire life. -Really? -Yeah. Hold for a second. My mom came here when she was younger. - Truth... - Shhhh I came here because I killed my... The bow of God's wrath is bent. And the arrow made ready on the string. And it is justice that bends the arrow at your heart. And it strains the bow. And it is nothing but the mere... pleasure of God. And that of an angry God. That without any... promise... or obligation at all... that keeps the arrow... one moment from being drunk with your blood. If your right eye cased you to stumble, then tear it out and throw it from ... for it is far better to lose one of the parts of your body than to have your entire body thrown into hell. The patients are treated by intense social connection. You, yourself are quite susceptible and are therefore likely in danger. Every time you open up, you are putting everyone at risk. I can't believe you know that. That is the purpose of the clinic. Tell me the truth. -What's wrong with me? -Your animal brain bred for harsh life on the savannah, is not suited to the present-day world of civilization and discipline. You need to open up yourself to complete reprogramming. -Only then will you have peace of mind. -You don't get it. Even if I can evolve, it will never be enough to earn peace of mind. That's the thing. How can I ever trust myself again? How could I ever get close to anyone again? -Well, for instance, through a radio. Ozawa. -That's your name. -How do you know? Control yourself. Don't lose focus. Stay right here with me. Listen, you must exercise will. Never saw like this before. -Stay right here with me. Yes. Let it all go. Let it all go out. It's okay. Yes. Let it out. What happened? I need more! You've already reached the limits of what we can safely do for you. But I am not clean, I am not pure, I am not perfect yet! What is this place? Does that stuff even work?! Of course it works. But it's not instant. And it's also up to you. You have to be able to accept the changes to let yourself be pure. -What if I end my treatment? -If you wish to end your treatment now, I'll have to recommend you be confined. -Confined? -Unfortunately, you are still at danger. Then I don't want to continue my treatment. -Are you sure? Yes! Yes, I mean it. There's one final level. We usually don't recommend it to people transitioning for the first time. But in your case an exception can be made if you feel it can help your progress. But I will need approval. Please, please, I fucking need it! Please! Please! Perhaps we should stop. I think we should try. A true purification might simply be too much for him. You‚Äôre my best efforts. I'll talk to him. Access the risks. Time to get up! Don't worry, it will all work out. It will be OK. Who are you? My name is Dr. Hamilton Price. You know your mother came here into this clinic as a young woman? Yes. No. I founded this clinic. And I treated your mother. And let's just say I fell in love with my work. Come on. You mean you're my... Yes. Both figuratively and literally. What's wrong with me? There's nothing wrong with you. I've made mistakes. Lots of them. But you're not one. You've just been a slave to other people's bad choices. Your mother and I... never accepted our responsibility... And now we're going to fix that. I'm gonna free you. Would you like that? Yes. Let me see your hands. I'm going to help you. With this. Just lay back. You know... a reflection... ...never really knows itself, never knows it's real. Because it isn't. Let's make you... Damn, this is some good stuff. I feel really... Think about it. I'll always be a danger. I thought you already come in. ??? I can't even trust myself. I've been thinking about that. And I have an idea. If you're willing to trust me. You shall be closer to that source that bodies need to be You, as a mind, are merely the vessel of its creator. And I have created this clinic to free us from the will of the maker. So that we may freely give ourselves back to the city of life. You need to look inside yourself. My soul. Let's sit. Close your eyes. Now breathe. Breathe in. Now breathe out. Your breath is a ball of energy moving down your spine and the top of your head. Focus those thoughts inward and see yourself. [????] You better take a look at this. -I'm busy here. -It's rejecting the treatment. Attacking like an invading army. Watch out now. they're all over the place. This isn't right. We have to stop this. It's working beautifully. Go on son, accept it! Accept it! This is what you call working? This is monstrous. We have to help him! We are helping him. What a beautiful delusion I lived in. I had no idea. I summoned you thinking that I would be safe! When I saw you, I ran. I ran to the edges of my own reality. I ran to the place that I never knew existed. The place where I would find myself. And I hid there for a while in plain sight. I must have looked like a madman. Overtaken with fear and grief. You had to go. You had to go far away to forget what I saw. And what I felt. And everything and everyone associated to that. And create a new reality. Because you see, you've destroyed my old one. So there was no going back. Have we changed ourselves? From one thing into another? I think the first thing is to allow our mind the path of the possibility that we may not be nothing at all. That what we think we are is actually a projection. A projection of a fractured ego. A projection of a damaged heart. a failure to consciousness from a social cotangent. thinking [????] from the inside [????] It's what makes the nerves between our toes if lightning strikes to reboot your integrated IBM desktop computer, and finally give you something older to die for. There was very little that was original in my life. Everything was stolen from a [????] that I have seen somewhere before. It made me feel comfortable. It made me feel connected. It made me feel... in control of my [distorted] destiny. You see, back then, I thought that that was what power was. To control the world around you. I feel like I'm meeting myself... wherever I go. It can be daunting. It can be lonely. [echoing] I am the vessel. [distorted]and I am always running [normal voice] from that vessel. And in that [distorted] and all that big story life... [normal voice] life seems to find me. [distorted] And embrace me. [distorted] But I fight it. I never give in. And as I do, I sink deeper into it. [distorted] so there was no going back. The problem with the truth is that once you know the truth, you can't un-know it. It will haunt you. You will see it in everything. And it will consume you. [distorted] you see, I... like you, I came into this world fighting. Fighting to exist. Fighting to stay in existence. Oh my god! And for the first time in life, in this experience that I call life, [distorted] did I see myself being seen [distorted] did I...being seen.... and your eyes looked at me. for the first time I felt the separation of myself [distorted] separation of myself... looking back at me... -I was so scared. -Close your eyes and listen. [distorted] and then that life... Do you hear the ocean? [distorted]that life I've been hiding from became human. Be baptized son. And breathe in light. The water is a symbol and you will be reborn. As the ripples travel across the surface, you will know the innocence and bliss you deserve. Stop feeling less aware, less present. There will be no more growing. Not anymore. You're home. My baby. I'm here. I love you.
