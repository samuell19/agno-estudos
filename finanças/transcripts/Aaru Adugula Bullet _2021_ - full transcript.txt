'AARU ADUGULA BULLET' [ship honks] [vehicles honk] [tires screeching] [tires screeching] [engine turns off] [in Hindi]: Show me who is that, rascal! He isn't here, bro. Where has he gone? That rascal has hit my man. Who is that fellow? -I don't know, sir. I don't know. -Don't you know? Don't you? [groans] -Hey, wait! -Ah! Come out if you are a man. -Ouch! Ah! -Come out rascal! Who are you, man? My name is Shiva... Born in Vijayawada, brought up in Hyderabad. I wouldn't forgot you if we just meet. But if it's a fight, you wouldn't forget me. This isn't any information... It's a warning. [in Hindi]: Bro, it's him. Rascal, how dare you lay hands on my men and warn us too? You are finished now. You are finished! Hey, get him! Hey! Hey, you shouldn't mess up with me... If I my hand get's started... Your body would start trembling. Hey! Richter scale would break down. Hey! Aye! Hey! Ah! Hey! Hey! Ah! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Ah! Pratap! Hey! This is Maharastra not our state. It has been just few days that you joined here, Would you mess up with workers? He didn't fix the elevator cable properly. People might die if it fails. But nothing happened, right? [in Hindi]: Boss, from today no one will work here. [in Telugu]: Dali... he is new here, I will explain him, you don't stop our work. I will give you whatever you need. [in Hindi]: I am leaving you because, he is requesting. I'll deal with you later. Fire him from the job. He will do another mistake if you let him go. -Rascal! Why are you provoking? -Hey, Dali... Dali! Hey! You learned Telugu with just a punch? -Hey, you... -Hey, Dali! Hey, stop! Boss, fire him... Else tell him to apologize. -Say sorry, rascal! -Hell no! Stop it guys! What are you doing? I hired you because your father was my childhood friend and requested me to. But you created a scene. Say 'sorry'! I don't like that word, and the people who ask me to say it as well. My business would collapse if you don't say 'sorry'. Would your father pay up for my loss? Ow! Talk with respect, man! How dare you hit me? You're fired. [men laughing] Thank you, brother. Did you expect an apology? You lost the job, right? Basically, I've done this to lose my job. Lose your job? Why? I am missing my family for past two days. It's been just two days, my boy? When I complained on someone who committed a mistake, They've labelled me wrong and got me attacked by goons mom. Oh no! Is it? I became skinny mom, you can't take it if you see me. I am coming back to Hyderabad. We are going to Vijayawada. Your dad got transffered. Why didn't you tell me about it, mom? Did you think I was dead or wanted to get rid of me? Why are you talking like that? Since this call began, You asked me to come home many times, How can I not listen to you, mom? Alright, come back. Did he quit the job? -What's his problem? -Well, he complained on someone... But they've fired him instead. Wont you change? Would moms like you ever change? Would you melt by his tears? That is why he called you. He wouldn't have a problem, he might have become a problem for someone else. You think he's sad out there? He might be enjoying there, I belive. I know him well since 30 years. He didn't study, neither has a job. He likes living like that. I'm tired and hopeless. You started annyoing me that he like's construction, I begged my friend and got him hired in his company. But he couldn't stay for at least two days. He is good for nothing. [birds chirping] My child! -Mom! -Mom! -How are you, mom? -I am good, my son. Damn! By the way, looks like you gained some weight? What happened to you, dear? You became skinny? I didn't have food mother, Your thoughts kept me alive. I was living on my tears. Would he ever change? Only his age has changed. He was 20 when you last saw him. -Now, he is 30 years old. -What thirty..? -Hope you are fine? -Yes, I am fine. -Yeah, go. -Fine. Hey, oldy! You look so strong. What are you eating, you're living so long? I am doing some house hold chores too other than just eating. Who is gonna feed me, if I sit without doing anything? Are you kidding me? Or else what, who's going to sit doing nothing? What do I do? The world is moving further and we are stuck here. Why are you still here, you should also have moved further, right? Grandpa died three years ago, then why are you still here, why didn't you go? He is irritating me. Few things can't be understood, leave it. I like construction business. If your son had encouraged me in it, I would have ruled the world you know. Alright, take this bag in. I'll go meet my childhood friends in Vijayawada. Hey, slow down this isn't Hyderabad it's Vijayawada. You tell them sir, or at least you, This is my shop, sir. I bought this shop working very hard. Why should I handover this shop if someone comes and asks for it. Should I be afraid, if it is Kashi or his brother? If you want to occupy this shop, you need to cross my dead body, man. Tell me, would you do that? Or should I lit myself? Huh? Tell me! [fire crackles] [screams in pain] [chaos] If I want, I just want it. That's it. Not a single dead body, I will cross mountains for it. Pothineni Tata Rao! M. Shiva Rama Krishna! When did you come, dude? Where are you? How are you? Wha are you doing? How much are you earning? Approx rupees 45,000, man. Oh my God! Forty five thousand? What job are you doing? My dad is a government employee, he earns rupees 35,000. Younger brother is an engineer he earns rupees 10,000. Total is rupees 45,000. Which means, you are doing nothing? I didn't get a job which suits me, And dad didn't support me for the business. No one understood me. Who you are talking to, man? Dad, did you recognise him? He is M. Shiva Rama Krishna. He is the same guy who sold your bicycle for Venkat Rao's school fee., This is him father. Hey, did I tell you not to make idiots your friends? Will we leave our childhood friend though he is an idiot, uncle? I am talking about you. Your dad didn't stop joking, dude. Hey, it's getting late for the event. Stop this and leave. -Dude, -Huh? When Vijayawada is very happy, then why did my grandma scare me? Leave it. -Hey! -Hey! Dude, don't shout. Is he a mad, can't he see? No one, will question even if he kills someone here. -What? -His name is Rakesh, Kashi's brother. -Who is Kashi? -Like a house is owned by a person, or a car owned by a person, he owns this city. Rowdyism, crime, mafia... all together is Kashi. But they said rowdyism has come down in Vijayawada? Yes, it has, dude. He is doing the job of 100 people. He is mad about wealth. He killed his own uncle for wealth. [knife swishes] [groans] He wouldn't let it go if he eyes on something. He would question if we see him. If we don't see he says, why aren't you seeing when I have come. He is egoistic. His ego is such... Can you see the mall? He occupied that land and built it. It was inaugurated exactly a year ago. Dude... Kasi is here. Did Koti bro come? He is getting ready it seems. [phone rings] [siren wailing at distance] Hello? -What? -What happened? It seems that he fell on the ground while rushing. -Koti bro's leg got fractured it seems. -Damn! We have called only him for the opening. What should we do now? Hey, he is a politician and this guy is a goon. Why would he come, he will not. Hey, how would it be if he appears in a photo with the minister in a news paper? It would look odd. -[indistinct chatter] -Boss... Boss... Minister's car has started. But not for the opening, but to his guest house. He lied to you because he don't like to come, boss. [music] What is this brother? How many things I have done for you? I asked you for the first time to come to the opening ceremony. I thought your presence alone would be enough for me. But you come to her? That too you lied to me. Kasi, I am a politician. We give assurances but won't give you a word. How can I say whether I will come or not when a person like you is asking? You need to understand. There are rumours that you and I are having connections. If I come and cut the ribbon, it will become true. Still, we shouldn't trust this media people. The time I cut the ribbon, they'll telecast it a million times. and totally they will tarnish image. Whatever but you are a goon. And I am a MLA of an area, more over I am a minister. We should be together in between four walls, but when we go out we have to act as if we don't know eachother. You have to condemn if someone says we are linked to each other. To put it in plain words, we have to meet someone like her and someone like you, only in the dark, man. Ah! Ah! What did you say? You compared me with her? Is it a shame for you to inaugurate my mall? Which leg is broken? Right leg? Left leg? Left leg, is it? Tell me! [screams in pain] -Hey! -Yeah? [music] [chants] [cameras clicking] Cut it, brother. Photos should look awesome in the newspapers. [laughs] [crowd applauds] If Minister has come even after his leg is fractured that means... Kasi isn't an ordinary person. What is with Kasi? Did you at least understand now, why your grandma, asked you to stay calm? Why are you thinking about that Kasi, dude? Look how colorful the life is... Come on, let's enjoy. Why are you so late, man? Everyone are here? Do you know, we didn't recieve our advance payment? -I will pay you, come on. -Come on, dude. "We invite you all to grace the ocassion" "This event begins from now" "The joyous moments vary from here on" "This wedding has brought new colours to this land" "The sky wove a grand canopy" "And the earth is set as a stage beneath" "While the near and dear grind the holy tumeric" "The wedding joy intensifies" "The art work at the entrance..." "Seems to be welcoming every guest" "The arch at the entrance..." "Seems to ask every guest about their well being." -Hello! -Where are you? You asked me to attend the Sangeeth event, right? I am asking, when did I tell you? I am your boss, you think I'm a fool? To pay you salary and send you to events and marriages? But sir, we are the event managers for this program, right? But, you asked someone to come at 4:30 pm, right? Sir, it was you who told me to. Alright, you better be here soon. [Telugu song playing in back ground] Hey, M. Siva Ram Krishna! Where are you going, dude? -Wait I will tell you. -Hey! Sir, I have already started. -Come, I will drop you. -I am on the way, sir, [music mutes voice] Please stop here. Stop! Stop! I am the boss here. -Your job is done. -Sir, I am here. Tell her what you need. We need a presentation. I gave a brief, did you make it? What is he saying? It seems that they have give you a brief of the event. When did they give me? Do they think that don't have a briefcase and suitcase? Brief means, the requirment, sir. Why are you still staring at me? Brief them. Sir, you didn't tell me. Shut up! I am the boss and you are an employee. Do I look like a man who accepts brief case and suit case to give a presentation? That is your job, why am I paying you? You bloody... One minute, sir. I will get you the file. -I am the boss. I... -You are the boss. Okay, so if you can tell me your budget, I will show you the set ups we have. Is this all, sir? Did you tell them everything? Did you tell them about my affairs too? Have you even told them that I call Chintamani as Cinthol, Lakshmi as Lux... -I didn't say any of those, sir. -Then? [mobile ringing] Hello, ma'am! He is still in office. I think he may not come home to night, there is a lot of work, ma'am. Okay, ma'am. -Who was on the call? -She was Lifeboy. Wow, you are dealing with Lifeboy too? Yeah... Yeah! Lifeboy, if you want take it. -No, I use Santoor. -Sir, give us 24 hours. -I will get back to you. -Yeah, sure. Yes! Go, home and take rest. I will go to Cinthol, Santoor and Lux, as I have full work, go. -Okay, then we we leave. -Yeah. Listen... You stay in the office and do all the work of this week tonight itself. Sir, night? When should I sleep? Do you want your sleep or your job? Decide on it! Sadist fellow! -Sir, greetings! -Greetings, sir. God! You danced very well, sir. You rocked it, sir. Sir, we waited for hours in front of your office to meet you. -The events you handle are awesome, sir. -Super, sir. -You are great, sir. -We are your big fans, sir. Yes, sir. Please have a seat. [chuckles] Film celebrities have fans, Do event managers have fans too? What do you mean? Sir, you are our God. Wow, what a stylish hair style you have! Looks very awful! Lux girl asked me to get it done in London, so I got it done. -Do you like it? -[in unison]: Mwah, super, sir. Ah? Why are you dull Mr? I have a problem, sir. Why do you care, you met your fans, that's enough. It won't be enough, you are my fans. Your happiness is my happiness. And your pain is my pain. I willl get hurt if you don't tell your problem. -Oh God! -I fell for a girl at the first sight. Didn't she love you back? She ignores me, sir. Even if I touch her she doesn't care, sir. Her skin might be senseless. She should be in love by now, but she's working day and night without leisure. Pity, she isn't doing any work other than the work given by her boss. Is it? She sat on my bike, sir. She didn't even recognise me when we met again. Oh! I couldn't see my girlfriend doing such hardwork, sir. Do you mean to say that, you also want to work and share her problem? -I am thinking to make her jobless. -Ah? She would be happy, right? I like you, man. You can't see your girlfriend working. Then, make her resign, what's the problem? -Her boss. -How he looks? He looks very ugly, sir. He looks like a socks which isn't washed in the past 6 months. -To be frank he doesn't look like you. -Ah? Yes. -Bloody rascal! -Cool down... -Control... -Cool down, cool. He is torturing my girlfriend, sir. Oh! Making her do all sorts of work, He ruined her glamour sir. -What should I do to him, sir? -Hit him. That would be enough. Ah! You are unfit. You are fired. -Sir... -Get out! [parrot squawking] -Thanks. -You are welcome. Looks like you are very upset. Won't anyone get upset if someone says 'you are unfit'? I have done so much for him. I couldn't increase his height, but... I increased his office to seven floors. How could he fire me from the job? He says I am fit for nothing. Do you know, if it was anyone else they would have died. If so, then I should die 100 times a day. What do you mean? The way we hear music in Sankarabharanam Shankara Sastry's house, In my house my family members scold me, for everything. I am talking to you, you are fit for nothing. We are dying to feed you. Hey, how are you living without doing any job? -Hey, Anand give me some money. -I don't have, man. -Hey, come on, sure you will have. -Hey, leave! You say you don't have but you have enough money. Even after bearing this much, look at me... how happy and joyful I am. Still, why God gave us ears? For what? For not listening the things we don't like. -Then, what about mouth? -To change the words. You just lost your job, not your life. You should throw such silly matters in dust bin, but you can't move on in life if you keep them into your head. If we give our parents life becuase they gave us birth, and boss because he gave us salary, then when will you give time to yourself? Still, what happened to you why are you feeling upset? Aren't you beautiful, don't you have courage. don't you have a boyfriend, don't you have a friend, don't you have a guide, or a philosopher. Leave these. Let's go to that Coffee Day and have a coffee and enjoy the life. Hey, when did they opened the coffee day here? Thank God, for not asking when I was born. Sorry, I didn't notice. That is why I am saying to see. Look how nice the sky is, look at the ground, how green and nice it looks. Look here, not there this side, don't you feel like loving love at first sight? -Love who? -Your life. Look how beautiful your smile is... You should always keep smiling. That waste fellow, I mean, your boss, he should cry seeing you. Come, let's enjoy the life. Enjoy! [music] "Shall we search for a new world for us like Columbus?"

You are doing a mistake, sir. I am not going to sign it. The law, justice and trust are still alive in this country. Is it? I remember that I already killed them. Fine let us do one thing. I am giving you one month time, prove me that the law, justice and trust you are talking about are still alive. Do nothing, whoever you trust, Tell them to call me and make them say, 'Kasi, whatever you are doing is wrong' 'leave Mr Murthy'. Let them say that. I will let you go. I am giving one month time, not for your signature, but for your belief. Hey, what's the date today? It's 31st, boss. Let's meet again on 31st. All the best! -Sir... -Why would I come to court? How dare they send me notice, who the hell is he? -It's from the court, sir. -To hell with the court! Sir, he tore those court notices again. They will issue an arrest warrant under contempt of the court. We have to struggle with that. -Tell him to come to the court, sir. -Hey, lawyer! Kasi... I am Kasi's brother. I won't come. He says he doesn't want to go. Sir, the judge isn't a good person. Lawyer, take how much ever you want. Give whatever the judge wants. Manage it. Now, leave! You asked me to come immediately? Thank you so much. Do you know how happy I am since past two days? Looks like you are enjoying a lot. Yes, I am but, a small thing is pending. Can you come with me? Even I will have a companion -Hey, stop it. -What happened? Stop here. -Whose home is this? -Wait, I'll tell you. [glass shatters] Wait, wait! What are you doing? Listen to me. Please, don't stop me. I mean... You wait here. Hey, who are you? I am the secretary who lie to you daily when you call thrice a day to check, whether your husband is in office or not. -Move! -Ah! -Hey, Rajesh! -Hey! Ah! Oh no! They are expensive. Move! Where are you hiding like a pussy? [glass breaks] Come out. What did you say, am I unfit? -I will kill you! -[groans] -Ah! -You are finished. -You? -You? I caught him, while he is trying to escape. Where are you trying to escape? I will... Hey, stop it! You must hit him, not me. Why should I hit him? I am asking why? He is a friend who is gifted by God to me. You are so short, why should I listen to you? -Because he... -Come on, say it! What will you do if I say? -What soap does he use at home? - He uses only Life boy. What about outside, then? About what are you talking? About Cinthol, Lux, Santoor, -Medimix... -Hey, listen, I won't tell your girlfriend anything. -Don't tell anything to me to my wife. -Fine, I won't. What would he say? I will say it. Look... Cinthol stands for Chintamani, Santoor stands for Sandy, Lux stands for Lakshmi, -Medimix stands for Madhavi. -What kind of a person are you? -They are all his mistresses. -Rajesh! Ah! I beg you. I will see your end to night. Damn! Hey, Rajesh... This is called 'Tit for Tat'! Hell with you. Do you know how would it be to carry an unpinned granade with you? What's that? He's the one who slapped me to fire you from the job. That is why I fired you. He is not your friend. He is your enemy. Shiva! Won't you tell me unless I ask about why you did this? I love you! Love at first sight. The problem is, your mind and heart aren't free. For you to love me you must know how much I love you. That means, you should get to know me. You should have time for it, that means, you should be fired from your job. That is why I did this. Now, we have a lot of peaceful time. -You are happy, right? -You rascal! You are jobless but why did you got me fired, man? Do you know how important that job is for me? Do you know how many lives are dependent on that salary? Wait, I am coming. Hey, it's ok if you lost your job. But I don't like you working in this house. Hey, this is my house. Your house? Who are they? They are orphans. I've adopted them and giving them proper food and education. Is that ok? Isn't it too much? You don't have anyone and you want them both? Shut up! I don't know what you would do, I lost my job because of you. Take care of me until I get another job. Crap! What are those words? Taking care of you? Shut up! From today, my rent, electricity bill, food, from hair clip till every small thing, you are responsible. Give him the groceries list. Excuse me, I have seen monthly maintenance and yearly maintenance but, this looks like your life long maintainance. Hey, this is for one month. -To eat or to resell? -To eat it. Go get them. [billing machine beeps] How much, madam? It's nine thousand rupees, sir. Here. Hey! You! Hey! Where are you? Hey! Where are you? -What happened sir? -Some guy is running with my groceries. Hey! Just stop there. Hey! Who are you? Hey! Just stop there. Hey! Give my bag! Hey! Come here. Hey! Hey! Stop there. Stop! Thief! Thief! Hey! Move aside. Who are you? Both of you just stop. -Hey! -Can't you see me? I was driving correctly. Who are you? That's my vehicle. Stop there. -You! -Please leave me. No I don't. That is my hard earned money. Sir, you can afford to buy groceries again. But' I'm so poor. Please leave me. You words have a lot of respect towards me. Are you really a thief? Remove your face mask. Remove it. Sorry, sir. Sorry! -[screaming] -Oh no! It looks like a wonder to me. We have seen people robbing money from the customers of the bank. We have seen people who rob the jewelry from the pedestrians. But I haven't seen people who rob the groceries. That thief is a well known guy to us. He was so respectful before hitting me. He was apologizing for hitting me. -I won't leave him. Get some water. -Okay. [mobile phone ringing] -Hello! -Murthy! Already 14 days have passed for your deadline. Only 16 days are left. Just sign the documents. Murthy! This house was built by your father. It's seeping here and there. The repair costs upto 2 lakhs. Just look into this matter once. Yeah! That's true. If the garden gets repaired I can grow some flower plants and creepers there. It's okay. We will discuss it later. I'm busy with some other work. -Don't ignore it. It's rainy season... -I'll discuss about it later. Can't you understand my words? Why did you steal the groceries? It's necessity! Necessity will always serve you new ideas. If I had your intelligence I would have setup a studio stealing my dad's cameras. -So why are you waiting? Do it now. -What? [mobile phone ringing] Just a minute. [mobile phone ringing] -Hello! -Where are you? Nayana! Did you get all the groceries you have asked for? The items doesn't match with list of items I asked for. He wouldn't have bought the same items you asked for. Who was that? You should adjust with the groceries I bought you. Adjusting? Who will pay the kids school fees and the house rent? What? How much does it costs? Rs 20,000 and today is the last day to pay it. Rs 20,000? She's is demanding me as if it is her father's money. Dude, give me your bike keys. The fuel is fully filled in the bike. Enjoy! Bye, dude. Give me one tea. Take it. Who was that guy riding my bike? What happened to my friend M Sivaram Krishna? And my bike? -Take this balance amount of Rs 4000. What is this balance? Why did you come in auto? Who was that guy riding my bike? -Who will pay their fees and rent? -What? Did you sell my bike? You're taking care of two girls child's education. I'm jealous of you. Oh god! My bike is gone. [mobile phone ringing] Nayana are you done? We have paid all the fees, rents and other expenses. Let's celebrate now. That's the reason I've called you. Tomorrow it's Diwali festival. I promised children in my apartment some fire works. Get some. If we spend all the money on other kids, what will spend on you kids in future? Shut up! Looks like a shining jewelry? Hey, that's the gift given by my deceased grand mother. Take this balance amount. You're too shy to say that to me. -Dad! -Yes! I want Rs 7,000. -For what? -I should buy some crackers. -What? -Yes, dad! I should buy different kinds of crackers which we light during Diwali. -Hey! Come here. -Mom! Are you giving me? You would have told me before. Look at your age and look at your requirement for crackers. Give me all the available crackers in the shop for Rs 7000. -You want all the crackers for Rs 7,000? -Yes! -Take your money. You can't these all. -Give the crackers that worth my money. -Give me that large one. -Okay! Give me a good one. It should work properly. Give me a good one. Yes! Give me the one which is beside. Yeah. That's right. -Give me one rocket type cracker. -Okay. Just add to this bag. Hurry up! I don't go! I don't! Are you dare enough to arrest me? Try to touch me. Sir, please send him. Already we have crossed the limit by not attending the court. Go, brother. Just check whether the court area is feasible to occupy. Don't worry you're Kasi's brother. Visit the court and come. We will celebrate Diwali happily. Hey lawyer, your time limit is 2 hours. After examining the primary evidences, it is decided to remand Mr.Rakesh for 14 days. You idiot! Sir! Sir! Sir! I asked you come back in 2 hours, but we his sent to remand for 14 days. Sir, we use this time to get rid of the case. We have 14 days with us. I will misrepresent the evidences and manage the Judges. He will come back. My brother was born on the day of Diwali. Today is his birthday. I planned to celebrate his birthday in the whole city. But he is not with me now. Sir, please sir. No one should celebrate Diwali as my brother couldn't. -Boys! -Brother! If anyone tries to burst crackers, warn them that I will burst their heads along with it. There is no Diwali for the city this year. [people screaming] [people screaming] Looks like all of you are waiting for me. Hey kids, here are the crackers. Let's burn them. Come on! -There is no festival for us this year. -Is anyone of the family died? -Kasi's brother was sent to jail. -So what? Are you new to this city? Confronting Kasi is like getting into troubles by self. First your fears are need to be burned. I don't get this. He is into jail as he did a crime. What did kids do? Won't you let them to celebrate the festival? Just look at them with the dull faces. Sister, let's burn the crackers. No, dear. Just listen to me. Let's celebrate the festival when he comes back. Please lets burn them. Just listen to me. Let's go inside. Nayana, let me explain. -You want to burn crackers. -Yes, uncle. -Which one? -I will burn the rocket. Come! Kids, all of you, come on. Siva? We celebrate Diwali on the occasion of killing an demon called 'Narakasura'. Then it isn't a festival if a demon called Rakesh is sent to jail? Uncle, are we doing this for sure? -Are you scared? -Yes! I'm with you. Go ahead. You know one thing. You're the first to burn crackers in Bezawada. -Festival is going to start with you. -Is it? Come on! Guys, some one is firing up the crackers. Don't fire the crackers. Stop it. [goons shouting] Rakesh brother got released from the jail. We can celebrate now. Did Rakesh brother get released? Is that true? Sir, heard Rakesh brother got released from the jail. Where is he? How would an accused in remand get released? Some one fooled us. He made the city to celebrate even after I denied it. Who is he?

Please! -Nayana, met my dad. -Greetings, uncle. Dad, she is Nayana. Are you in love? -Can I talk to her? -Sure. -If you leave us, I'll. -Is it an interview? -Yes! Okay. All the best, Nayana. Do you know about him? -He told me uncle. -Oh great! Look, he leaves the house in the morning. And returns the home in the night. He comes to my office for money. No one knows about his life style, his activities and hid friends. As a father, even I don't know about his activities. You might have seen a father who talks to a girl whom his son is loving. You might have seen fathers who warn that girl that she isn’t correct to his son. But I'm different. My son isn't correct to you. He is in love with you and he is roaming with you because he is useless. Try to understand. Love is fine until one don't have responsibilities. He isn't eligible for marriage. Can I come? -This is the bill. Its Rs 1200. -Okay. I'll pay. Stop, dear! Don't mind, dad. She will pay. Why will you pay? Son, you pay the bill. -Me? -Pay the bill. -Okay, then. Do you accept cards here? -Yes, sir. Is it? Do you own any cards? What you have is mine, dad. Give me you card. I'll pay it. You pay the bill. That's what I meant. Give me your card. I'll pay it. Okay I'll pay it. But, when will you return the money? That's my dad sarcasm. You have seen fathers who gives money, but have you seen who lends the money? When will you return the money? In a month? or two months? or in an year? What are you talking, dad? The person who can't take the responsibility don't need to love. A useless guy don't need to show attitude. [deep exhale] One should look into their purse if they want to do some expenses. It's not the others purse they should look into. Listen to me, dear. I'm saying this with 30 years experience in taking care of him. Love is fine until one don't have responsibilities. He isn't eligible for marriage. Dad! You forgot to add some tip. What does your father think about us? He might think that he insulted you. But, he insulted my love. Hey, He don't mean it. He might be in some office tension. How can he insult his son in front of a girl? Insult? I don't care all those things. These things are normal between dad and a son. Just ignore it. No! I fought with the boss who insulted me at the office. He is different person. But here, it's my father. These things are normal in a family. Just leave it. Is it a family? Is it great to insult the elder son of the home in front of others? No need to stay there. Leave the house. I'll take care of you. Do they think you can't live with out them? Nayana don't heat up the issue. Leave it. Damn! I don't even like to enter such house. -Is that a family? Crap! -Hey! That is my family and he is my dad. He has every right on me. he can scold me. He can hit me. And I like to staying without eating. But I prefer to stay at home. My family is my strength, honour and life. Leaving the relations is so easy. it's like cutting a thread. Being together may be as difficult as binding a thread. One who leaves the house fearing those relations is always be alone. First learn to respect and love the family. I don't like who just loves me. I like the girl who loves my family too. To gain her love, I'm even ready to die and take birth again. You're asking me to leave my parents who are everything to me. What is the guarantee that you won't leave me in future if you're angry at me? If I can't get the girl until I leave my family, I don't want such girl in my life. Good bye! Have you observed, dear? Your son is same like you. You used to think that many people should have food when we celebrate any occasion. Now, your son is doing the same. I think now your soul in resting in peace. All these my brain didn't get some ideas. I was confused about the land which belongs to you. Now I got some idea. I want to donate it to Kanaka Durga temple. Some one will have some food in your name. My grand mother! Do we own 10 acres of land? It's not 10 acres. It's only 4 acres. I was just guessing. But it went right. Do we have 4 acres of land beside Baba temple at 'Padamata'? It's not in Padamata. It's in Benz circle. -In Benz circle? -Yes! Come, let's discuss about this. -Tell me what's your problem? -Sit and listen to me. How did you manage to hide this secret for 20 years? Do you know that it is worth of crores now. You want to donate it to Kanaka Durga temple? I just want to know. Do the goddess is lack of money? If she want to bless us, she will bless all of us. She don't require those 4 acres of land. -Please give it to me. -No, I don't I don't want your permission for that. I will take it myself. Are those the documents which are in your luggage bag? Why will I keep them in the luggage bag? It kept them safely in a plastic cover and placed it under my pillow. Oh god! I'm so lucky today. -Thank you grandma! Thank you? -Hey, don't touch them. I'll kill you. -It's okay! Hey, don't touch them. I'll kill you. Grandma! Grandma! Grandma! If you try to own those properties I'll torture you turning into a ghost. Grandma! -Mom, what happened mom. -Mother in law, what happened to you. -Mom! Mom! -Grandma! She raised us with lot of love. She might be arrogant with her words, but she was always good at heart. By the way, what was she saying you before she left us? That's...she told me to take those 4 acres of land. Mother in law! You love your grand son a lot. Murthy, sir. Grandma is still alive. Mother! Mother! Oh! No! My 4 acres of land. My documents. -What happened to my documents? -Mother, what happened? -My 4 acres. -What happened, mom? Still you didn't understand? Your elder son tried to steal these 4 acres from me. I was in hurry that he might steal these. Then my slipped down. I'm happy that I'm alive. Didn't you ask him to take that land. Why will I ask me to take it. He was trying to steal it. I never give you these documents. Even if I die. What's this, dear? Murthy sir's family has a lot of respect in this area. You tried to killed her just for the land? Now everyone is so angry at you. You took down all the respect your family own. Oh god! Okay. I planned something. But it didn’t go well. Leave it. Leave it? -Planned to kill her? -What are you talking, dad? Don't talk. Don't talk. I thought that my father's soul will rest in peace if I donate some food. But giving birth to a son like you never make his rest in peace. Why are talking so? I'. accepting my mistake. Grandma, try to explain him. Why are you creating a scene here? Am I creating a scene here? I'm securing all the respect and honour our family has from the past 50 years. You took down the entire respect on to the road in one day. Nothing change now. Even tomorrow everyone will greet me, if I go out. But, there used to be respect in that. Now it has some sympathy. Dad, why are so concerned about the other people? Do they really care for you? Donate your assets as you like. It's your wish. I'll sign all the documents. Dad, it's my mistake. Please forgive me. I never repeat this. -Mom, I'm hungry. Serve me some food. -Don't serve him, Lakshmi. -He's just joking. Come, mom. -Don't serve him, Lakshmi. Can't serve myself if you don't? Everyone can eat the food prepared for the grand father's ceremony. But, I'm not. You should not eat this. You're not worth enough to taste the food offered to your grand father. Listen to me carefully. From now, you will not even a grain of rice from this house. What are you talking? That's it. Dad, why are making this bigger? What was my mistake? Doesn't the grandfather's property belong to grand son? Don't we have a right on that? Tell me! It's all over and again you are talking the same. Why are talking about your rights? You should be my son first, to become a grand son to grand father. And I should say that but not you feel it. Now I'm telling it. The guy who took off my respect is not my son. You're not my son. He is my elder son. Get out! Get out of the house. Why should I? This is family and I'm your son. I don't go leaving you all. Damn! Stop it. "I like this family. I love you a lot. I don't go anywhere" "I love you a lot." I'm tired of hearing all those words. If you love this family so much, what have you done to it? Tell me what have you done? Are you useful to anyone of us in this house? Always talking about love. What we do is called love. We love you even if you don't have a good education like her and a job like him. We even love you if you don't earn like me and we're bearing your torture. That is the actual love. That is the love of the family. What you said is not love. The tree in front of our house is far better than you. I planted it when you were born. Now after growing up it is producing some fruits. It will give. Because it was watered three times a day. Medicines were sprayed for the strength. A stick was planted for support. Grandma was kept as a security to avoid the tree from insects. There was some investment. Then it give some yield. Did you invest on me? I told that I want to start a construction business. Did you listen it? No! What would you have achieved if you started it. Didn't you lose the job after I managed to get you a job there? How many times should I explain, dad? I can't live without you all. I don't like to live a life where I earn money and I send you half of it. And I can't live alone happily with the rest of the amount. If I have to do so, I prefer to stay jobless at home. Great! One will be always ready to move around the world for the family. But you're not even ready to move out of the house. More over you say that you love your family. Why are you acting so? You know you don't work and you can't. Because you got used to depend on us. And you name it as family and love. You're a lie and your love is a lie. To explain in one word, it is not the love you have. It's your need. This is not your house. This is hotel which serves you food with you charging a bill. This is a lodge which serves you when you want to sleep. We are not a family to you. We are ATM machines which provide money when ever you require. Wow! What kind of a life is yours? Dad, I never thought in that way. I always thought you're all my family. -Get out! -Dad, listen to me. Get out of the house! -Mom, stop him. -Get out! Mom, try to stop him. Get out! [telephone ringing] It may be from our son. [telephone ringing] He don't listen to me. -How many times should I tell you... -Murthy, sir! "Law. Justice. Belief" Didn't you find any of these, murthy sir? I'm coming. Please sign the document and send me with respect. Don't provoke my ego. Okay? What happened? Who was that on the phone? Is our son fine? Who was that on the phone? I'm observing you from a month. You're feeling so scared and tensed when you receive a phone. Last time, you were so angry when I asked about house repair. -What happened to you? -What should I explain, mom? I'm feared that I may loose this house. What happened? Kasi! Kasi wants to own our house. -I liked your house, murthy sir. -I'm not selling my house. I'm not here to buy it. If Kasi likes a house, he occupies it. he never buy it. He gave a time of one month. I tried a lot to get justice. I've approached police, lawyers, societies, MLA's and many officials. But they are cared of Kasi and they were helpless. The deadline ends in an hour. How will be here after that. -Drag them out! -Guys, come on. What are you seeing? Come with me. Hey, stop! -Please leave him! -Leave him. I expected you will handover the signed documents by the time I reach you. But it didn't happen. Now, my ego got hurt. So...I dragged you out of the house. Sign the documents. -I don't. -Guys, make him do it. -Dad! -Sign it. Son! -Sir, please leave him. -Mother-in-law! Dad! Dad! They are hurting your family, Murthy. Sign the documents. I won't let you put your hand on my house. I don't happen when I'm alive. Leave me! Leave! Son, look at him. Please go and save your father. Please go and save your father. [police siren wailing] Sir, I beg you. Please save my husband. I beg you. I beg you, sir. Please save my husband. Come on! Come! -I beg you, sir. -Lakshmi, don't do that. No, Lakshmi! Look at the people who are waiting to see you die. Look at your wife who is begging for help. No one will help you! Why about others? Look at your son. He is so scared. While everyone understood me, why are you unable to get this? Why are you still so stubborn? No one is born in Bezawada city, to turn against me. Leave me! Leave! Son, give me you phone. Give me. Son! Look at me carefully. If Kasi like anything, just give it him. If you deny to do that, you will be dead. How many times should I say you? How may times should I warn you not to provoke my ego. Father! Hit that idiot! Hit him hard. Hey! How dare you hit my father? No, Siva! You know nothing about them. Yes, I don't know father. I don't know how to study like sister. I don't hoe to do a job like my brother. I don't know how to earn like you. I don't know to feel responsible like you. But I know one thing father. If anyone lays hands on my father, I know how to break it. You can sold me. You can hit me. And I even stay, if you don't serve me food. But I can't stay without you. It is not me 'need'. It is my love. My love is not a lie. It's true. You... you know whom you are fighting with? Kasi! Kasi! Kasi! Look at him carefully. He is my father. And that is my family. You might kill your own family for assets and properties. But my family is an asset to me. Be it Kasi or anyone, I will tear them apart who tries to touch them. Heard that you're so confident about no one can turn against you in this city. But you must have understood this when the Diwali was celebrated which you denied. You must have understood that there is man in this city to turn against you. Listen! This is my father's house which means it is my house. If anyone tries to dig it with a crow bar, I will insert that in their heart. Sir! I don’t know about the issue, but I'm very happy sir. What are you talking about? It's about your elder son, sir. The people who blamed him all these days are praising him for the thing he did. Really it's very great sir. I'm very happy to listen this. Super, sir. Really super, sir. [mobile phone ringing] -Dad! -Are you busy? Can I speak to you? Please tell em dad. Come to my office once. Just stop! Don't get down. Let's go! When did buy this bike? No, I don't own a bike. This is my friend's bike. Come! Let's buy a bike. It's required dad. I can manage without it. I don't like Murthy's son asking his friend for a bike. It shouldn't happen. Come! -Hi, Kareem! -Hello, sir. He is my son. -Greetings, sir. -Greetings. I want to buy him a bike. What's the cost of it? It's Rs 80,000, sir. Avail me some discount from the company's offers. Adjust the price. You select the bike. Hey stop the bike! Come here! Give me a plate. Is it good? You want one more? Give me the sugar candy. No dad! I'm not kid to eat it. You used to ask when you were in 1st standard. But I didn't buy you. It don't look good. It is an children food. I'm buying you and you're eating it. Give me two candies. Son! When you were born... I had a lot of thoughts about you and your life and education. I dreamed a lot about that. But, when you weren't like that, I was very angry. I scolded you. I beat you. Finally, I sent you out of the house. I did a mistake. You should dream about your life, but I dreamed a lot about it. I'm sorry. You shouldn't say me sorry, dad. Parents shouldn't force their dreams on their children. They should try to make their children dreams happy. How I did miss this small logic? Hey! Hello! I went out with my son. Tell me, what's the matter? Was it your elder son, who bet Kasi? It's my personal issue. Leave it. How can we leave it easily? It's normal to see a son turning against a person who hit his father. But here he hit a big guy named Kasi. But he did a small mistake. What was that? He forgot about me. Dangerous Kasi has a brother too. He will get angry if anyone hits his brother. He gets provoked if he gets angry. Your son forgot that he will kill other person if he is provoked. Don't get scared. I won't kill you. This eyes saw the fall of Kasi. it should again witness his raise. But your son is finished. Hey! Who's that? I think you're Rakesh, Right? Heard that some one beat Kasi. Will Kasi stay quiet? Leave about Kasi, will you keep calm, if anyone beat your brother? Won't you find him and kill him? I thought you would do so. But what did you did? You became useless and went to father... and warned him with a pen on his throat. Hey! You may be Rakesh and your brother may be Kasi and the city may be scared of you. But, you are dealing with Siva. Siva! You rascal! If I my hand gets angry, your body will get an earth quake. Rector scale will be too high. -You! -Quiet! Kasi, you went after my father and I came after you. It is balanced now. I'll forget about this and you too forget this. Your brother is on a plan of killing me. Look! I wouldn't have beat you if I was a person who thinks about the consequences. I don't have such fears. Generally, I don't beat anyone. But if I do, I'll make sure that hand will land on the body and blood is out of the body. Leave it. Why should we leave it? What do you want? What do you want? No! No! The knife which cuts the fruits will also cut the throat. -Cut! Cut! -Cut or compromise? Compromise? -Louder! -Compromise? Learn from him. You're saved. I wish you a speedy recovery and normal lifer after this. Bye! By the way... my family which was out tot track for 30 years is perfect now because of you. Thank you so much, brother. Good bye! Dad! problem is solved. He never dares to face us again. Compromise. How did he agree for it? I explain him in his style. He never look at us again. I'm so happy now. By the way... you fought with people who shouldn't come to our house. -What about the one who should come? -Who's that? Daughter-in-law. Search for a good alliance. I will marry her. Hey! Hey! Wait! Stop there. What about that girl? You did all the damage and now you're asking about her? What did I do? You scolded me that I'm not eligible and I can't pay the bill and I'm useless. That was back then... She asked me to leave this house saying that this house don't deserve me. I was angry on her. I scolded her and I left her that day. You did a mistake. When all of us didn't understand you. She was the one was with you. Do you know she was the one who felt sad when I was scolding you. She loved you a lot. She became a part of this family when she started loving you. You care for your family a lot and how did you leave her? I don't care about what happened. We want our daughter-in-laws and you're getting her. That's it. If I go now, I'll be done. She will see my end. It's your job. I don't care about that. All I need is that girl. -Come and serve me food. -Yes! It's not that dad... -Stop! -What? Is she really so beautiful? Does you pair look good like me and your grandfather? -It's more than that. -Oh! Why are proving your sadism and remembering about her beauty? What's the matter? Her beauty and her glow! "Your sharp looks cuts down the my smile" "My heart got your sweet love bite" "You made me drown in your love" "My heart is filled with you in every inch" "Your looks got me a lovely heart attack" "You made me to get on love track, fully" "You made me to get on love track, fully" "You killed me with a love bite" "Your sharp looks cuts down the my smile" "My heart got your sweet love bite" "By the time sun rises and the light for the eyes" "You emit your glow as lightening to me" "By the time moon raises and star struck hard" "You will shower your smile which is a cool breeze" "I'm spending a lot of days in your memories" "Without you I'm always incomplete" "Your looks got me a lovely heart attack" "You made me to get on love track, fully" "Your looks got me a lovely heart attack" "You killed me with a love bite" "Your sharp looks cuts down the my smile" "My heart got your sweet love bite" "Let my foot marks cover your foot marks like an umbrella" "I'm always with you like your shadow" "Let my eye brows turn into wings and fly my eyes" "And I'll search for your presence every second" "My life was a mess before meeting you" "I'm eager to lead a life with you. Come on handsome" "Your looks got me a lovely heart attack" "You made me to get on love track, fully" "Your looks got me a lovely heart attack" "You killed me with a love bite" Hello! -He is calling you. -I know. Just move. hey girl, please stop once. Who are you? What do you want? -Big egoist! -What? Nothing! I came to ask about my matter. What's the matter. it's nothing. We don't each other. You said that you will leave me too if you get angry. Now, I'm angry and I'm leaving you. You have your family. Go and leave with them. Bye! it's not that. Listen to me. What? Tell me? Do the men speak as they like when they are in love? Don't compare me with all other men. What will you do if I compare? You're here to beg me. Not to irritate me. -What? -What? Are you only one who has a family. Don't have a family? -Then why are you not staying with them? -It's my wish. I don't like some one demanding or commanding me. I don't like male domination. That's the reason, listen to me. I don't like you. I don't marry you if beg me and plead me. We are done. I'll marry anyone idiot except you. But I don't marry the guy who rejected me on my face. No other will be a better choice other than me. If no one is there, I'll make one. -What do I lack? -Then go ahead. -I'll find. -Go ahead. We will also enjoy it. I'll find a better choice on the spot. -See the line, there. -Okay. The first person to cross the line will marry me. -If it is a girl? -I'll marry her. Any problem?

Dad, if you speak so, this time it will be difficult for you to find the address. Don't blame me later. You can stay if you want. You can visit Kanaka Durga temple. Don't try to disturb me. Don't be so angry. -Can't understand this girl. -Oh my god! Who will marry her if she is behaving like this? Excuse me! -Buddy! -Buddy! -Buddy! -Buddy! -Buddy! -Buddy! Buddy! Leave me! I'll die.

Parents are not allowing Kumari to come out of the house. -Is that your problem? -Yes! -I'll bring her out and get you married. -Is it? If you move a step ahead, I will stab you.

Don't make me a hero. We as your fans won't accept it, if you deny though. Why are you here as sudden surprise? How do you know that we are here? I'm here for Naina! I found out that she stays here.

Where is the guy? -Please be quiet. Don't you introduce him to us? Which guy are you talking about? I'm talking about your son. Not my son. I'm the guy ready to marry. Son-in-law? Please don't call me so mother-in-law. Your relations will get changed. Father-in-law! Am I father-in-law to you? Do you the age difference between both of you? Age is not a matter. Love don't care about age. It was your girl who proposed me first. You can enquire her. -Nayana! Call her! What is this? Are we here to see this nuisance? This old man is saying that you loved him. -It's no that... -Tell them Nayana. Tell them that you love him. You are brave enough to propose him on the road. But can't you tell them now? You want to marry him, right? Who is this guy? He is Nayana's friend. And he is my well wisher too. What is this dear? Yes, dad. I love him and I wan to marry him. Hi, darling! -Come on darling, Lets go the park? -Okay! Please stop them. What is this, man? You told that you are her friend. Tell me, what's the matter?

I can't understand when you say like this. -That's it, right? Come. -Yes. If I get the clarity then you'll also get it. Yes. If she is convinced to me, that means she has convinced to you too. -Correct. -If she fall for me, that means she will fall for you. Here I don't understand, sir.

How can she falls for me if she had fallen for you, sir? -Deepak Raj. -Yes? -If I get the clarity first... -Yeah.., -You will also get the clarity. -That's right. If she is convinced with me, she will get conficed to you too. This is also right, Only if she is okay with me then only I can make her agree to you. That is why she will get convinced to you once she is fallen for me. -Yes or no? -Yes. You said 'no' till yesterday, how did you get convinced just in a single night? I gave it a thought mom. Am I right, who came this far leaving you all for my happiness, Or Shiva who left me for the sake of the family. I felt it is my selfishness and it's love with him. I called him to tell sorry in the night. But he united our both families in the morning. Brother-in-law, you don't have to think of anything. How much dowry do you want What type of gifts interest you, tell me clearly. I've gathered some 500 acres already! How can we get love with money, brother-in-law. You are sending a girl who couldn't bear even if his own father says a word. as a father you gave me the chance to fulfil my sons life. This is enough, brother-in-law. Psst! -Hey, Deepak, why are you here? -Ah? -Oh. I am sorry... I forget. -You willl forget man. I came here because that short fellow called, me. -Engagement it seems. -Yeah. I thought it is for me and her. But it is for her and you, it seems. -Shucks! Deepak... -Yeah? -What did we discussed that day? -What did we spoke about? Talk slowly everyone will listen. What did we spoke? [fast forwarded speech] No. how can she falls for me, if she has fallen for you? -Hey, listen carefully. -No, I won't agree, How many times should I say? Everyone will listen. They will get to know, be silent. If I gets convinced to me then she'll also get convinced to you. That's it. If I get the clarity then you'll also get it. Yes. If she falls for me, she will for you too, So, you should stay close and bless us. -You should have food too, okay? -Hmm. -Mwah! -Ah! [chants] Please exchange the garlands. Come on, you put that garland. You both change your garlands. Come on. Both the families exchange ritual offerings. Exchange your offerings. Make some pan with those leaves. It would be fun. Take blessings. Get married soon, and within an year, give us a beautiful gir-- Give birth to a boy and keep in his hands. -Okay. -[screams] We shall leave. -We are leaving. -Dad, you go home, -I finish my interview and come. -Okay, come fast. -Bye. -See you. -See you. -Bye. Bye. [phone rings] -Hello? -Nothing, bro... I felt like telling you a story. Once upon a time there was a forest. A goat which went for food in that forest. Ha mistakenly disturbed a Tiger. It left home after finishing her food. After returning home, all other goats told it that, 'you disturbed a tiger, it won't leave you, it will kill you and eat you.' That goat couldn't hide its fear and couldn't kill it's ego, how courageous it was when it disturbed it, with the same courage it went to the forest. And asked tiger, what has happened is happened, forgive me, let us compromise. Seeing the situation even the tiger agreed to compromize. With that the goat felt it is all settled, happily it settled it's marrige with a female goat. But, the who compromised didn't leave it. It attacked the family of the goats and ate them. Why did the tiger break the word? Because the tiger lied. The group of goats is your family. Hey... That tiger is me. Hey, please... [phone rings] Bro, tell me? Hey, where are you? Ah, Kondapalli Khat. [tires screeching] Hello! Hello? Cam you hear> [tires screeching] Hello! Come on, drive fast. [tires screeching] [music mutes voices] [tires screeching] Hey! Get going. Push them. [screams] [screams] [gasps] [indistinct voices] [glass shatters] [groans] Hey! [groans] [groans] -Yea! -Hey! [groans] -Hey! -Hey! [groans] [glass shatters] [music mutes voice] Hey! Ah! Ow! Ow! [gasps] [knife swishes] [groans] [engine starts] Hey! [knife swishes] [blood strapping] What is this, son? Huh? What's happening here? No, son... don't stay here go somewhere. Go far away. -Go some where far away, peacefully-- -Should I escape? [vehicle arrives] [siren wailing] -Who is Shiva here? -It's me. The one you stabbes is in hospital fighting for his life. If anything happens to him, I have to arrest you. =No, inspector-- -Arrest me now on attempt to murder. -Come... -Hey! -Hey! -Hey! I know that you are Kasi's guy. I am letting you go seeing your uniform,, If you come to us again and again, this time there wouldn't be attempts directly I will kill. This time not anyone else, tell him that I will kill that Kasi. Go! Kasi. I thought a fellow is roaming inside my house these many years but. I understood it recently, that he is my big son. To my big som, who is born after 30 years, I am not ready to lose him Kasi. I am afraid that he would become a goon, or a rowdy in this querrels. If you are so scared, why didn't you give me your house when asked? Why do you disturbed my ego unnecessarily? Vijayawada is my palace. I sentence the one who oppose me in my palace is, death penalty. Here are the papers. The house is yours from this second. Give us a week time, we will leave it. Huh! Deal is very nice. Actual is given. Then what about the remaining. Your son has insulted me in front of others. How will you make it right? Kasi, please. Why are you requesting, sir? Ask your son to request him. Tell him to beg Kasi to spare his life. beg him sorry catching his legs. I mean, he don't have the habit to say so. I don't think he would say. You want your son, I want his apology. You want this to get to an end and I want to win this. Lawyer, people say that I am egoist, right? I am telling that I will forgive the one who layed hand on me, right? How, would I am an egoist? If I had gone for ego, I should have killed him, right? You understood it, right? You can leave now. You just have two ways from this house. One is to Kasi's house and the second is to the grave yard. If you get your son then come here, if you carry him you will go there. Shiva has started this for my sake. He fought for his family. Now if I ask him to give an apology to Kasi... I can't do that mistake. But I can't stop Kasi too. He can do anything to satisfy his ego. There is only one way to stop this querrel. Shiva should give an apology to Kasi. It is only possible for you. No, uncle... Shiva won't listen to me-- He will listen to you. Tell him that it is for your sake. Tell him that it's for our family sake. I don't care you would play with his streangth or weakness/ But it's your responsibility to convince him. You can think that why a person of your father's age is talking like this. If he is my life, then this is my last way I am trying to save my life, dear. [cuckoo bird coos] Are you waiting for someone, hubby? -That is... they will come, you go. -Yeah. [parrot squawking] -Greetings uncle. -Thank you, dear for accepting this. He is in his room, come... come. This way dear. He is inside. Go, go... Hey, idiot! Hey! Hey, what are you doing, son? I have a small work with him. He isn't listening to you that is why I sent her inside. They both didn't got married. There is no link for marriage and this. You come. Hey, wait! "Hey, don't consume my heart... don't do it" "Hey, don't consume my heart... don't do it" "Like we stole the sweet from Setty's store in our childhood" "Hey, don't consume my heart... don't do it" "Like we eat the snacks hidden by mom" "Hey, don't consume his heart... don't do it" "Did I drape it after seeing you or did I see your after I've attained my youth?" "In these strange eyes, did I hid myself and gave myself to you?" "Did I flirt with you and add scent on me or did I added scent before flirting with you?" "Did I gave my heart to you in your love?" "Like we stole the sweet from Setty's store in our childhood" "Like we eat the snacks hidden by mom" "Eyes so round and body so smooth" "Kiss me with your warm lips, like a sweet" "Decorating myself with ornaments" "You are my future husband, so make our cozy home ready" "I'll marry you soon" "I'll be as close as a soap to you" "I'll be your cute puppy always" "Hey, don't consume my heart... don't do it" "How did god carve it so smooth? "The beautiful girl is shining brightly" "At the time of engagement" "Why do you play around with me?" "I'll be there on a snap of your fingers, I'll take you for a ride on a horse cart" "I will give myself to you with my little finger" "Hey, don't consume my heart... don't do it" "Like we stole the sweet from Setty's store in our childhood" "Like we eat the snacks hidden by mom" Wow, it's very nice like this Naina. I love you Naina. Naina, if I had know it would be like this if we get married, -I'd have married you long back. -Hey, wake up! Hey, how come are you here? How did you come here? I am right here. You are in your dreams. Wow! If in dreams I am feeling like that, it would be great in real. You say like this only, but I can't sleep. First I remember you, later I remember your issue with Kasi. Hey, chill. I can't. Do something and end this, right. I hit him, when he came for the house, when he came for dad and also on me, still how many times I have to hit him? Um, can't you hit him on his ego for once? If it gets satisfied, he won't come to us. Tell me clearly. Nothing, can you give an apology to Kasi, right? That idiot will fall silent then. Get out! Get up! Shiva! Shiva. Shiva you are hurting me. -Shiva leave me. -Hey, leave her. -Leave her. -Get out of the house. -What are you talking? -Do you know what she said? I have to give an apology to Kasi, it seems. He did the mistake, he was the one who broke his promise. He even thought to kill my family. And you wnat me to apologise to him? If the same happens to your family would you talk like this? You asked me to make him agree, right? Why don't you talk? Is she telling the truth? Tell me. Yes, it's true. What mistake I did that I should say sorry to him, dad? Say something, dad... What do you expect me to say? What do you expect me to say? I can slap and say that you have done a mistake if I had a bad son. But I know that you didn't do any mistake, son. I know that you are right. But whatever is going on in your life isn't right. Not knowing how to explain it or what to do, I am experiencing hell from 2 days. Listen, son... For those who have not had children even after 25 years of marriage, the happiness the get when they get to know that their first child is born, the same happiness is what I am feeling. Hey, showing you a nice future, I want to feel proud as a father. But that Kari won't let any of this happen. I couldn't stop him, or couldn't lose you, I couldn't come before you and ask you to apologise to him So I requested this innocent girl. Hey, once... say sorry for once. Hey, I said I will say sorry by bowing near his legs, but he did not agree. He wants an apology from you only. This is my life-- What is this dad? I thought we had become close. But you left the gap as it is between us, dad. You should have told me, right? Before the love you are showing, few letter word 'sorry' is nothing. Not once, I would say as many times as you want me to. Hey, give me a word. Whatever he says, or whatever happens there, promise me that you won't get angry. You are leave me no option, dad. Promise me, son. I give you my word, I won't react. Hey! When did they come? Hey, you said that you would blast my heart Why are you standing like a stone here? Are you here for your life or for you dad? For apologising. Louder, I can't hear you. Brother, I beg you. I have lost my sense that I opposed you. I did it not knowing who Kasi is. I will live telling your name, please forgive me. Guys, he is asking forgiveness, -shall we let him live? -He should ask us too, brother. Beg to us, beg us to let you leave alive. Brother, I beg you. Please ask him to forgive me. I won't lay hands in front of you, I will not even lift my head. Please. Wow. What a father and son combo you both are, super! Son who is begging for the sake of his father. And father who gave his house for the sake of his son. I don't like a man who bows his head, or a woman who raises her head. Get lost! [music mutes voices] [music mutes voice] Will you leave the one who insulted you in front of everyone, for a small sorry? When he gave his house as a alms to you, you leave him without doing anything? That's not right, brother. If this news gets out, even a stray dog of Vijayawada, will pee in front of Kasi's house. It would apologize if you shout on it. Is that okay? Is it okay to you? His father is worried what happens to his son, if he gets into qurrels and murders. That is why, the one who was ready to die for that house, has given the document to us as a piece of paper today. After these many years, his father became close to him, with the fear he would again go away from him, he bowed his head though he could fight. Hey, their sentiment is their curse. If we make him a goon, his then father would be finish. If he becomes then his father won't let him inside the house so, he is finished, Finish! [laughs] Brother, our man is in the hospital. Let us meet him, come on. -How is he doctor? -He is alright. I am discharging him tomorrow. -You do the payment mean while. -Thank you doctor. Um... If you don't mind, How are you related to him? You are taking care of him daily. Does that should be a relative to ask about good and bad days. I am just a common man. It's okay, sleep. -Who do you feel now? -I feel good, brother. I survived by God's grace. Anyway, what is this man? Don't you care about your life? I am living for you, boss. Not just this, I will give my life for you, boss. Shiva! Shiva! [pants] It seems, the person you stabbed died in the hospital. Cops are coming to arrest you. -Did he die? -Yes, uncle. He was fine when I went to see him in the morning. He was going to discharge tomorrow-- What is this, son? He didn't die, dad. Kasi killed him. What are you saying? He said he will leave you if you say sorry, right? What is this again? Your way isn't right for him dad. I am the right person for him. He won't listen if we bow our heads, -we have to cut his head. -Shiva! Only one can be alive in this city. That might be Kasi, or Shiva you will get to knoow today. [both laughing] Not the real joy starts. Call him once. [phone rings] He is only calling brother. What? Did you understand who is Kasi, now? The hunt has begun. Run, run away. Hey, I should have killed you in the very beginning, but you escaped. I should have killed you when you hit me on road, but you escaped. You can't run anymore. Run! Your dad felt very much that you shouldn't become a rowdy, but I made you. There is a charge opened on you. Run! Hey, did you became dumb or did your heart stopped? Come on, talke. You made a mistake Kasi. You made a last mistake in your life. Until now my dad struggled because he doesn't want me to become a goon But if that situation comes, my dad would feel no matter if I become a goon, rowdy or another Kasi, it is enough if my son is alive. How did you missed such a small logic, man? I am ready to go to jail. But not for the murder which I didn't do. I will go only after killing you on road in front of everyone. Hey! Hey! Hey! Come, come...! I will be waiting alone in the center of Vijayawada. -Come on! -[screams] Guys... he is the one who killed one among you brutually. His soul may not rest in peace if we just do the rituals. His soul would rest in peace only when he is chopped into pieces. Kill him! Hey! What's the querrel between you and me? What's the querrel between you and me? [electric crackles] [groans] Ow! Why do you want to kill me? Ow! [glass shatters] Ow! Ah! Hey! Ow! Ow! Hey! Ah! [knife clanks] What is he for you? Is he your brother, younger brother, or brother-in-law? What is he for you? Hey! What is he for you? What is he for you? One among us. Who will get lost if he is killed? For whom, it is? [groans] To his wife and his family. Then who has to take revange? It's his wife's revange. If she feels that I killed him, and if she wants to kill me, then ask her to come. Without moving a step, without laying hand, I will let her kill me bowing my head. Call her. [sword swishes] Before your husband's final rituals completes, kill him On the name of your ruined life, kill him. Go, dear. Kill the person who widowed you. Lakshmi don't leave the perosn who killed your husband, kill him. Aye! Kill that Ba****d brother. If you want me to kill the person who killed my husband. Then I should kill that Kasi. [weeping] I am there for you, boss. Not only these knife stabs, boss, I will die for you. Then give it. -Boss? -Huh? -Boss! -Sir... -No... Ah! -Hey! -Oh no! -Hey! Please leave him, sir. [gasps] [muffed groans] [sobbing] When my husband was looking at me for help, fighting with death. I stopped for my daughter, brother. When these men are saying that they will die for you. We thought he would be our support but, we didn't thought that he will make us orphans like this. Brother, this Kasi has killed my husband. This Kasi is the murderer. His father wished for our lives asking about him every day coming to hospital. But for the one my husband fought, came to the hospital for one time. Not to make our lives better. To kill. They say, if we offer anything we like going to Kashi something good happens. Now, I am saying if you leave this Kasi you all will be good. Not one or two, hundreds of families would have better lives. Kill him, brother. I opposed him because he has layed hands on my father and disturbed my family. But you gave me another great reason to kill him, madam. Hey, Kasi! Diwali date for Vijayawada has changed. For this city today is diwali. -Come! -Kill him, guys! Hey, let's go guys. Hey! Hey! [sword swishes] Hey! Ow! Hey! Ow! Ah! Ow! [music] [music] [metal gate creaks open] [music] Sir, sir... I will give your house back to you. Not only your house, if you need I will give you my house. I will leave Vijayawada, sir. Please stop him, sir. Or he will kill me. At least you tell him madam. Sir, please... stop him, sir. I will catch your legs. [groans] [door opens] [groans] I requested you many times, but you didn't. If I ask my son to stop he will stop and you will live. But I will die as a father for him. [groans] [thuds] [indistinct chatter] Check your bag. [knife swishes] Ah? My name is Puri. If you want your life, or business to run, you have to give money. From today, this whole Vijayawada is mine. Don't you goons get out names other than holy places? Kasi, Puri, Sri Sailam. Hey! [knife swishes] Fine. I will give money to safe guard my future. But if I start giving money. Then your future will become like that. Is it okay, for you? -What happened to him? -Sir, alms. A six feet bullet has hit him If not this town another town. Hey, it could be any place but your games can go on till just one person opposes you If one does, the same scene will repeat. Are you trying to scare me? I have a knife in my hands, can't you see? Do you know we have courage? [knife swishes] God! [crackling] [sizzling] Dad, you also come. Hey, I won't come. I feel scared, son. [indistinct voices] I will go sit outside. [laughs] Hey! My saree got burnt. God! [laughing]
