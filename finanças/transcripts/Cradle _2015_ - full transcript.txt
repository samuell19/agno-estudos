Subtitles by explosiveskull ♪ Ah-hi ♪ ♪ Ah-hi, ha ha ♪ Hey, I've got tequila, beer, and whiskey. Gentlemen. Not the smartest place to get a drink. You're a long way from civilization. We went through a lot of problemas to get this information. What my amigo means is do you have our money? Or just wasting our time? Man of his word. Good to see this in our business. Mister, you sure you want to do this? This only brings death, your death, if you know what I mean. The map? Why do you seek this? It's my business. I find that a man of few words, is a man not to be trusted. Johnny! Looks like you're running from someone. Or something. The map, don't make me ask you a third time. The map? The deal is off. Price just gone up. What's the new price? I'm afraid it's everything you got! Hey! Hey! You're just gonna leave? Make me clean up your mess? Wanna take a ride? I'm working. Suit yourself. Thanks for the help, pal. Baba, I'm working' here. Well, I hope you didn't pull a muscle. Not a chance, I knew you had everything handled in there. Change of heart? Yeah. Great, let's ride. Anna, Anna! Anna, get in here! - We need help! - Hurry! - What are her levels? - Bad, we need a sedative now! First we should get her into cardiac position. No time, sedative, now! - Her heart rate just hit 200! - Anna, the sedative. Anna! Pedro, I need you to get into your bed, cover your eyes and ears, can you do that for me? Get over here, do it now! Okay, she's stable. Anna. Anna! When I tell you to do something, I don't... Sedatives will wear off in a few hours, we're gonna do exactly the same thing tomorrow! Don't tell me how to run my clinic. Filling children with anesthetic morphine, not a cure! They're in pain, Anna! They need our help. What they need is a cure! It's not gonna help 'em if we're just gonna shoot them up every time it happens! We need more resources for a cure, more doctors. They only sent me you. We'll never know why some survive and the other die without letting me run these blood tests! What I need you to do is stop playing scientist. The girl almost died. We have work to do. He meant you, I'm off. Really? Are you gonna be okay? That girl, she just looked at me like she knew me. It's the drugs, no doubt about it. I didn't come down here just to watch women and children die. I came here to make a difference. I thought you came here for me. Thanks for the support, by the way. Anna, you know I don't like to get all worked up, it stresses me out. You know our job is to just try to help as many people as we can. And that's why they send us here. I know. Alright, so don't rock the boat down here, I like this place. Something ain't right about it. Yeah, people keep dying. Then why won't he let me do the blood tests? I don't know. Maybe he is afraid you'll get all the glory. Yeah, right. She calls for her. She... she's dead. She must stop the evil. Yeah, I'll tell her. She calls for her. Hello. Sit back and let the medicine do its work. It hurts. I know, but it'll make you feel better. Will it stop the pain? I'll try my best. Anna, am I gonna die? No, sweetie, you're gonna be just fine. I hear many of the other nurses talk sometimes, they think we can't hear, but we do. I know there's no cure. Okay, there's no cure yet. But you know what, we're discovering more and more about this every day, and before you know it, you're just gonna be right out of here. I hope you're right. We'll find a cure, I promise, okay? You'll be fine. Anna, you can't keep making the children promises. It's not good for them. You do things your way, I do things my way, nurse. She's a loose cannon. Anna... Anna... Where are the children, Anna? Anna... Hey. Yeah, I'm almost home. Go to the forest, go now! Death is there, death is everywhere! You can stop it! No, no, no, no, no, I'm sorry... Hey! Leave her alone. Happy birthday! Whoo-hoo! Oh my god, you're getting so big! - Thanks! What everyone loves to hear. - When did you get here? A few hours ago. You didn't really think I forgot your birthday, did you? Happy birthday, baby. You didn't call. Why didn't you tell me they were coming? Well, if I did, they'd have nothing to yell when you walked in. Yeah. Alright, champagne? - Yes sir! - Let's get this party started, baby! Happy birthday, baby! Whoo! To Anna. Oh, he's been kicking so hard ever since we landed! Oh. You know, things haven't gotten better here, like at all. Yeah, I heard. A lot of kids, huh? Let's not talk about that right now, shall we? Nadia, so do you know yet? I'll be happy, boy or girl. He's the one hoping to raise a big strong man to chop wood and bond over fishing and whatever. Breakfast for the pregnant lady. And the pretty lady. Uh, I don't know, I just think that you should know the sex before they're born, you know, you don't want to go out there and buy the wrong colors. And why invent the technology? Because normal people want to know! Are you scared? Uh, no I'm excited, you know I love kids. Why am I a professor? Have you given fatherhood some thought, Manuel? Um, no. Raising a boy, is hard work. Look what I have to deal with. Oh you think that's funny, right? Something isn't right. What do you mean? Weren't you supposed to get here after the baby was born? Eh, yeah, no you're right. Um, the college sent me out her to study the legend of uh, a rare beast. You know allegedly this beast only appears here, you know, nowhere else in the world. This creature never shows itself, so if I can get a photo of one, then, eh. And what is this beast? The White Witch. - Who? - Come on. - What are the... - No, really, you've never heard of the White Witch? - No idea. - No, I'm out here studying local legends and apparently the White Witch is one of the oldest. Uh, I'm gonna get some juice. He's full of shit, there is no witch. I don't know, the locals seem to believe in her, huh? To our health! To our health. Something on your mind? Same as always, brother. You know another trinket to find, another place, another place like this. Yeah, you're not losing your will? Baba, come on, you know me. It's just that, you know what I don't want this to turn into another jade at Jakarta. That wasn't my fault. Those locals, they weren't very friendly. Friendly? They wanted to cut our freaking heads off, man! Nah, just the King. The King. Look, I've been with you since day one. Even back in basic. Yeah, Fort Bragg. Good old days. Yeah, they were, man. They were. You know what, I'm starting to get this feeling, like I had in the Philippines, and also in the Congo that time? This place here, man it's... You know, I get the same vibe! When was the last place you didn't have that feeling? You know it's just like the walls are closing in, and get so tight you can't breathe. We should really, really rethink this plan of yours. You really believe that? Or you just haven't located your next victim yet? Ha, ha, you know me too well, brother. Hm... In and out. Locals won't even know we were there. I hope so. You know what, I kind of got used to this head of mine, and I want it to stay right where it is, none of that fft! Well, since when? I was always the man with the plan. That's right, you were, I got to toast to you that, man. I'm gonna check my gear again. See you in a bit. I'll finish this beer, man. Mr. Raleigh, you better be right. Got everything? Baba, come on, I've never let you down yet. That's true. I'm not sure this is the best time for them to visit. Yeah, I know you don't really like company, especially since you can't keep your hands off of me. I'm so tired, like, I had a hell of a day. Well, I understand. Since when does he study legends? I don't know, but it's not very manly. And it's not gonna make him mayor of the town either. What do you mean? Well, people around here believe in all kinds of things, you know, if you go poking your head in their business, they're not gonna like it. I said no. What's wrong? Nothing. Hey. Come here. Why don't we go to the beach tomorrow? I can't take a day off. It's not possible. Well, I already took care of that. Really, you did? Well, it's your birthday, baby. And you can't save the entire... You can't save the entire island. I mean I can't believe Nadia's pregnant! Like, I guess we reached that age. Well, she looks fat to me. Like... Hey. What? James... James... James, James... James... James! Whoa... You alright, man? You scared the hell out of me! Was that you? What? No, uh, I just... I heard something. Ah, it's probably the humidity, it does that. - Ah. - In this part of the world it's always kind of, spoken to people, you know? Oh, dude, this morning, some of the elders came up to me and they were warning me about that white stranger with suspicious gadgets. - What? - Walking out of my place. Stranger? No, no, I used to live here. Yeah. Yeah, but these people don't remember that, man. They're ancient. I mean you should have seen them with my iPhone, - passing it around and whispering. - Yeah. Well, I guess they think that your cameras were like, kind of would disturb the balance of this place. But do they mean the witch? Well, these people believe in all kinds of things, so it's better to just stay away. Yeah, I won't bother them. Yeah, it'd probably be better. You know they can get really... Oh yeah, yeah, no, I get it. Their legend goes all the way back to the Mayans. You know, I really wouldn't talk about it too loud around here. - Why? - Well, superstitions, I told you, they are... they're a prehistoric people, and, that's like an omen around here. Look, trust me, alright? You got work to do and these people can get really crazy if they find out that you're trying to catch one of those things. It's their local legend, you don't want to mess with it. Okay, well, is it an omen or a legend, which one? I don't know, both. Relax. Can you tell me what the hell we're looking for? If I did, you wouldn't be out here with me. Oh that's terrific, that's great, just great. Spiders, mosquitoes, snakes! What are you mumbling about? Ah, nothing I'm just venting, man. God, where is this beach? It's secluded, none of the tourist BS. It's beautiful. Thank you, baby. It's like we're in high school. Yeah, right. Do you think he's gonna ask you? Who? Manny? I don't know. What is that? Anna! Anna! Hey, get away! Anna! Anna! What is his problem? We need to take you to her! - No! - She calls for you! Hey, back off! When the night comes, they will come for you! For all of you! I'm right here, why don't they come now? The night belongs to her! Yeah, you better run! What? Those ladies need to know who's in charge! I've seen you before! Why are they after you? I'm wondering the same thing. - Anna! Are you okay? Are you okay? - Yeah. I'm alright. Can I help you with something, pal? - No, no... - Is there a problem? He saved me! Who are those ladies? - Disciples. - Of who? The White Witch. You're in danger. From a few old ladies? I don't think so. Well, for some reason, they think you're a threat to the witch. Me? Why? I don't know. But they didn't seem to want to talk. So you're just gonna say that and leave? Yeah. I didn't come here to save a girl. I came here for the witch. Well, those ladies looked like witches. Why don't you go after them? They're her minions. She can control the weak minded. You don't believe in this stuff, do you? Don't I? Maybe you should start. - You're okay? - Yeah. - Let's go. - It's so weird. You're alright? Are you okay? Oh my god. - I'm gonna go and check out the hats, alright. - Okay. It's happened twice now. Twice? Last night, on my way home, some of the locals stopped me. You're sure you're okay? I'm alright. Those old ladies scared the shit out of me. What did he mean by her minions? M-hm, I think heat must have got to them. Well, next time those ladies come back, they should take Manny. Hey, you're feeling alright? Hey, maybe we should take off for a bit? Well, I'm not leaving my patients. Alright, good for you, baby. Don't let those ladies mess up your day off, okay? You know what, they didn't. Hey, come here, what's wrong? Alright, I tried. Anyone down for a glass of wine? Oh you know what, I think we're done for the night. We'll see you guys in the morning. Goodnight. Well, I don't know about you, but I'm wide awake. What did I do now? Oh, I don't know, why shouldn't you ask those girls from the market? What are you even talking about, Anna? You know exactly what you did! - What I did was, I tried to give you a good birthday! - No. But obviously I failed. I mean you're being ridiculous, come on, please! Honestly? They were just asking for directions, that's it. What a great day! It's a bad idea. I don't have any choice. She only comes out at night. Yeah, then let's wait for the daytime. This jungle stuff's for birds, man. You know why I didn't tell you about it. Yeah, you're right, I would've never came! Oh god! Is that the witch? What the... ♪ The best part of waking up ♪ Morning, Nadia. Morning. ♪ Is Anna in my life ♪ For some, I guess. What's up? Hmm, good morning. Really? Trouble in paradise? No dude, she's crazy. Any luck catching the witch? You know, I'm not really looking to catch her, I just want to show that the legend is, you know, just that. Well, for starters, you need to reposition the cameras. They're all looking at the trail. You know you need to cover more ground. Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah. I'll keep that in mind. I'm just trying to help, man. Oh I'm sorry, dude, did I look like I was asking for directions? Shut up, man! Wait, pause it! What is that? It could just be a lens flare. Or the witch! It's probably just an animal. Anna! There you go, get it out! Uh, shouldn't that be you? Only in the first trimester. This is all you, lover boy! Did you eat something bad? Did you eat anything? Here. Thanks. Hey, you're okay? Okay, Anna I'm sorry, alright? I'm an asshole. You are, right here, you are an asshole, like, you know what, you're like even more than that! What? Isn't it like obvious? You're gonna be a father, you asshole. You're joking. I wish. Anna, don't play with me. Really? Baby, I'm so... I'm sorry, baby! Come here! I love you, I'm sorry, okay? I love you, I don't care. Really though? I'm gonna be a daddy? I'm gonna be a daddy? I'm gonna be a daddy! Yes! Yes, baby! Good morning. - Hello. - Morning, Maria. Where's Pedro? Maria? Maria? Where's Pedro? What happened? Not in front of the patients, come here. Come here. I'm sorry. He was a very good boy. Yes, don't... My fault. No! I told him he would get better. I wasn't even here when... Anna, how many times are we going to go through this? This is the job. Please, you have to pull yourself together. These children need us to do our jobs, not to cry for them when they are gone. Do you even have a soul? Look, you can attack me all you want, but you know it's the truth. I just call it as I see it. Anna. I know it is hard. I'm sorry about the boy. His name is Pedro. It's so strange. That doesn't make any sense. Anna! Anna! Hurry up! Get me the injection now! God damn it! There is something in their bloodstream, that's not supposed to be there. - What? How do you know that? - I tested some of it. Without my authority? I told you not to do that! Oh! She's gone that way! God I hope not! Like, are you still afraid of the dark? Hey, you know what, we stay here any longer, she'll come for us again. Oh I'm counting on that. Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of. Well, it appears our witch, has paid a visit to the hospital. Who are you laughing at? Oh we must be getting close. Huh... I need this like a hole in my head. Anna... Am I gonna die? We'll find a cure, I promise. You promise? I promise. Nothing. has haunted locals and taking them into... They're eternals. Not possible. Just need... to rest. Don't even scream, 'cause no one's gonna hear you. Exit's there, you better hustle. - And who are you supposed to be? - The white knight. Are you willing to die for that girl? I was gonna ask you the same question. I think you're making a big mistake! I think you're making a big mistake! I think you better pay attention! Listen, gringo, I don't care who the hell you are, your ass is mine! Are you gonna tell me where the White Witch is or am I'm gonna throw your ass off this balcony? Believe me, you don't want to know how to find her! I am not gonna ask you again! - Welcome to the party! - Yeah, and it's a good thing, 'cause that guy right there, was gonna turn you into Swiss cheese. Hey, you got that right. I was trying to get a couple of questions answered but these guys had other ideas. To hell with 'em. I'll tell you one thing, the dean is gonna be pissed off. Yeah, I think you might have lost your scholarship. I'm ready for some good tequila. Hey, I'm buying. Open up, Manny! Open up! Manny, open up, let me in! Okay! Open up, open up! These men came after me! What men? - Wait, wait. - I went to the library. - Calm down, calm down! - I went... I went... - I went to the library. - Why did you go to the library? What men are you talking about, Anna, calm down, calm down. It's okay, it's okay. It's okay, breathe, breathe. What's going on, baby? What happened? Anna? Anna? What's wrong? What, what, what? What's wrong? What's wrong, baby? Look, they're here in San Juan! We need to talk. About what? I'm a hunter, I collect things. What, like Indy? I track things down for people. They pay good money. Are you here for the witch? You don't believe in these stories, do you? What exactly were you researching? My patients are dying. I will do whatever to stop this. Are they really dying though? I think I would know the difference. Then how come I found one of your patients from your hospital, out in the jungle? That doesn't make any sense. Why would they go there? God knows what's lurking out there. I don't think they're doing it on purpose. You mean someone forcing them? I mean she might have been drugged. Who would do such a thing? Somebody protecting something valuable. Yeah, out in the jungle? Hey, guys! Come check this out! These three, they look familiar? - This is Pedro. - Who? He was a patient of mine. They told me he died! Who's they? Anna! Baby? Hey! Do you know where Anna went? - Mm. - Uh-uh. She could have waited. Ha! Anna! What? Why didn't you wait for me? I called you! Uh, my phone is off. - How long have you been here? - Mm, like a few hours. Anna you're gonna drive yourself nuts if you keep going along with this hunter's story. That lady, that we lost yesterday, her body is missing. They probably already got her. And took her where? Look just don't get involved, okay? You're not a cop and this is dangerous. Someone has to stop this. Yeah, and that has to be you, Anna? I don't see anyone else stepping up! He comes from the next village. Over there women are dying. They're like possessed. Three pregnant women died. We can't help him. Anna's the most qualified person to understand what's going on, and this could give us a wider sample. I'm sorry, but we have to go. Anna, you're not going anywhere. Excuse me? Like I said, we need you here! Our children need you! My workers stay right here. I don't work for you! Of course I can call Dr. Alvarez if you like. A larger sample can account for many of the variables I'm considering. I know that you don't understand it, or believe it. It's what you don't believe, Anna that's gonna end you! Okay, we're here to end the suffering of these poor souls, not rewrite God's history! I'm here to save lives, not to debate about it. Come on. We gotta go. Dr. Alvarez we have a problem. Oh you weren't kidding about being short-handed. Can you help us? We're gonna try. Get me vials for blood samples. Let's start with the boy. It's worse than I thought. What are we gonna do? I don't know, we have to find a cure, that's the only thing. We have to go into the jungle and find the witch. That's some idea you got. Ugh! There's a rock. Map says this is the place. The place for what? Damn, somebody beat us to it. Hey, brother, we gave it a shot. Time to go home, beer's on me. Not so fast! I guess we're not going home. Eh, we're gonna need more supplies, and more people. Oh great, that'll be fun. Just what I was looking for the whole trip. - Got it. - Alright, I'm gonna step out for a second, okay? You're one of them, aren't you? You're doing this. Don't come close to my girl again, you understand me? Or I will kill you. We know about the baby. Get out of here. Anna! You've saved many lives. Not yet, but I'm trying. You can save them, I trust you. Thank you. It'll be alright. Hm... Where were you? Um, I had an emergency. Oh no. I'm sorry, guys I've been just all... Yeah, you're alright? Want one? - No. - I need one. So what was the emergency? Some other village has the same thing happening. Must be spreading. Oooh, it's the witch! No, speaking of that, I saw those old ladies again. - Really? - Yeah. And get this, they know about our baby. What? What? You don't think it has anything to do with the story of the witch, do you? Guys, you should leave. Nadia's pregnant! Oh. Alright, Anna, don't be rude, okay? - The number you've called, nine, eight fo.... - Hey... Who are you calling? The treasure hunter. Anna, you can't trust this guy. This guy's a... The guy who saved my life? I need to find a cure. Anna, we've talked about this, alright? I need to know that you're willing to help me to take the samples! What? I was with you every step of today! I stood up for you! Okay. The number you've called, nine eight, four, one, seven, seven... Fuck! The moment this baby's out, I'm gonna drink like, Dean Martin! Who? Shut up! What about your breast milk? Oh yeah, you should pump and dump! Keep talking, and I'll pump and dump your ass! Sorry, guys, Anna's a bit emotional. For sure, she's pregnant. Uh-hum, it gets worse. Puppets. Where are you? At the bar in your village. I... I'm pregnant. Why are you telling me this? That's who they usually go after. Hello? Yeah, I'm not a guy who usually gets involved. I don't believe that. Ask around. This illness, or whatever's going on, is spreading. Same thing happened in the next village. And you helped them? That's my job! Well, then they'll be coming after you too. Who's they? Someone who never wants you to find a cure. I'll have to call you back, friends just showed up. Hey! You're gonna tell me everything, or you can join your ugly friends here! I really hate violence. I'm sorry. It's okay. It's okay. Come here. Okay. Mm, I just want you to be safe. Hey. Uh-um, take that outside. I'm quitting soon, come here. We're going to be a family, and that doesn't work without you. Last one, I promise. Oh shit! You really know how to make an entrance, don't you? Anna home? She doesn't like surprises. She's in trouble. Mm, is she? What makes you the expert, huh? Hey! You see this, this ain't my blood. Someone wants to shut us all up. For good. Manny, she's having complications! - Oh, oh! - Take it easy! I'm sorry, I have to go! This is my clinic, I'm gonna be alright. Things aren't what they seem to be. This is my sister, and she needs my help! This is what I do, I get involved! Be careful! Ah, ah, ah! Go! Women. Really. Hold on tight. Where? Where? All the way in back! Right here! Just gonna run a few tests, you'll be fine, you'll be fine! Anna, where's everyone? That's impossible, find Maria! Just go, go, go, go, go! - I can't lose my baby! - Do something, do something! I can't lose my baby! - We gotta get out of here. - Did you find anyone? What? We gotta get out of here! Get me a sedative! - Are you sure? - No, No! Anna! Why do you keep following me? Your boss, the man that runs this place is responsible for all this. He's a doctor! And, where are the patients? Well... We try to help people here, he can't... Dr. Alvarez is only interested in helping himself. How do you know that? Because I can show you where all your patients went. Tell them. The doctor you work for, I work for him too. Yeah, what are you, in charge of bedside manner? I'm the muscle. Your boss ain't what he seem. How so? He's out in the jungle, looking for the Lost City of Gold. Come on, man really? He's been searching for years. So he used the legend of the White Witch. Are you really buying this? There is no witch, there is only gold. So the witch is a cover? These people fear her, the legend of her goes back centuries. He make it seem like she came back. And my patients? He using them to dig for the gold. He poisoned them with some drug, then they dig and dig. The children? He knew if he took them, the legend will grow. The witch would live in their fear. I found a shrine, it was meant to scare anybody that might venture out that way. No, we have to step in. Damn right. What's the problem, I understood everything he said. Now, tell me the drug he gives them. How is she? She's okay. Is that gonna make it stop? It should reverse the effect. Thank you. Alright, I have to go. Where are you going? To stop this. - Hey, we're having a boy! - I thought that... I know I just... I called the doctor 'cause I wanted to know, I couldn't wait. So, thank you. You saved my little boy's life. Keep an eye on here. She needs you. She'll be all right. You hear, you should be alright. I've seen him before. Come on! What happened? Oh he's a big one. He's all yours, brother. Alright. Watch my hat for me. No, problem. All you gotta do is get out of the road. So that's how it's gonna be, huh? It's a bad decision, buddy. We're having fun yet? Baba, what took you so long? I was about to order a pizza. Your concern is overwhelming. And give me my damn hat. Here you go. Well, that was pretty cool, the car is toast. It's alright, we can go on foot from here. I hope you got more clothes in that backpack. I hope you do too. Yeah... Can I help you? I need a guide. To where? Know this place? I don't think you want to go there. Gimme a minute. He's the best guide. I heard you're a doctor. Yep. You know it gets real lonely in the jungle at night. Not that kind of doctor. Victor. This place we're looking for, is sacred ground, man. You don't want to go there. I've been warned before. It's dangerous. Especially for you. Alright, let's stop here. We're gonna look for a place to camp tonight. Oh god damn it! I'm sure James is taking good care of her. Yeah, I hope so. So what is that map really of? You wouldn't believe me if I told you. We're camping out in the middle of the jungle, at night, so just try us. Alright, you've heard of the Seven Cities of Gold? Okay, how about Sir Walter Raleigh? Yeah, everyone has. This map was his. Stolen from his family collection in England. Walter drew this map after he found one of those cities. Of gold? That's the legend. Legends come from somewhere. I'm sure it's not a city, but a room full of gold. Damn right, there better be! People have been searching for those cities for centuries, right? But not in this area, and not with this map. Why didn't Raleigh take the gold with him? That's a good question. His son was killed in combat with the Spaniards. So he went back to England to get help, and he never left again. Why? Simple, he was beheaded by King James for disobeying his order not to fight with the Spanish. So how does the witch fit into your story? She's the legend, kept everybody from coming out here looking. How long have you been looking? - Vic, did you hear that? - What is it? Th... that's probably the White Witch herself. Come on, man you don't actually... No, no, no! Don't move, stay down. Stay down, stay down! Stay right here! What the hell are we doing now, He-Man? Do you see, do you see anyone? Oh shit! Any more, Jorge? I'm not sure. Look at me, are you okay? Yeah, are you? No, hell no! We gotta go back now! - No. - That's what they want! - No, we should stay, we have to help these people. - What? It doesn't look like we get much sleep tonight. - Indeed, let's go. - Let's go. What is that? Remember, somebody went through a lot of trouble to keep this place hidden. And what exactly are we looking for? Where they're digging. Be quiet, keep your head down! That's our patients. This will bring them back. Take it. Oh Pedro! Dr. Anna? I'm right here, I'm here! No, don't! Clever girl! You should not have come here! Come on, come. You're coming with me, in case any of your friends survive! Come on, get in, get in! Get... Argh... What are we gonna do now? You know they're gonna be guarding the entrance of the pyramid now! You're right. I got another idea. Welcome to the jungle. It's a dead end. What do we do now? We swim from here. What, in there? Yep. I hope you really love this girl. Yeah, why? Because you're probably gonna drown. Move! I have been looking for this gold for 10 years! I heard about the legend, when I was working at another clinic. Using those women and children, just so they can work! Nuts! Brilliant! Free labor is hard to find. And the witch? Yes, I heard about that legend too. And I discovered bringing her back would keep the locals off of my back. Prying eyes don't go looking for a scary bedtime story. But then you came along, looking for a cure where there was none. Now what? They will help me bring back the rest of my gold. And then, well... Then? Then we'll end up like Maria? Maria got too greedy. I don't like to share. You're just in time to see the fruits of my labor. It couldn't be. You're real! Don't be afraid! Come on, come on! Oh no where are we going? I'm sorry you didn't get your gold. There'll be plenty of maps and plenty of tombs to find. He looks like you. Oh I know, you say he's so sexy, right? Pretty soon we'll be here with our baby. I can't wait. - Really? - Really. I'm so proud of you. You're the strongest woman I know. You're the strongest, most beautiful woman I know. And I was hoping, you know since you let me knock you up, that you would also let me be your husband. Will you marry me? Yes. Come here. I love you, I love you. Oh. Maybe he could give you away? I think we could do worse. Yeah, we can. I'm calling about the map. Let's see the baby! Yeah, you can do it? Oh I've got something much better than that. Subtitles by explosiveskull
