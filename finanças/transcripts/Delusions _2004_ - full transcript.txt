Donna Productions Presents A film by Nimrod Etsion & Saar Lachmi Ayelet Bar, the star of the film "A Moment Before the Dream", tell us, what is the film about? Funny you should ask. The truth is... The truth is that when I read the script, I didn't fully understand it. I must say that even during shootings I didn't fully understand what the film was about. And they tried to explain it to me, but then the film got out, and there was such a huge buzz around it, that I said to myself, hey, this is really... It's really a great film. I'm paying this psychologist so much. Why can't he solve it, for God's sake? - Mali, it takes time. It's a process, there are no magic solutions. Johnny Rocker, how was the transition from rock 'n roll to the big screen? Look, I didn't come to this movie as an actor, I came as a poet. Because first of all, I am a poet. "Rating" Do you think we're a good match? I think you're quite a catch. But my life isn't interesting at all. Life isn't a movie, it shouldn't be droll. And Shakespeare said, I mean, Shakespeare! That the world is a stage, and everyone's got his own movie. You understand what I'm saying here? You get where I'm coming from? It must be some pure souls that are afraid of new blood in the system. Yes, of course, no doubt. Good luck. But you can never beat the truth doctor. You can never beat the truth. Ruth, I'm done here. You can enter the next patient. Tamar Gal, you can come in. He thinks it's a disease. He doesn't understand that it's ideology. Did you know that the theme song "Right is Not Left", which you wrote for the film, would become such a hit? Of course. It's a good song! Look, I believe in the power of good songs. I don't really believe in these psychologists. He's a psychiatrist, it's a completely different thing. He's a doctor. Do me a favor, keep an eye on her. Tami, are you feeling alright? And now, to the young and much appreciated actress who needs no introduction - Tamar Gal, at the start of her new movie. Tami, tell us a little about the character you play. This time I'm playing a very borderline character. We wanted to find out what happens beyond the limit of sanity. As I understand, you actually went to a psychiatrist. Yes, I went through a marathon of mental treatments. The psychiatrist was extremely cooperative and at a certain point he thought I have really lost it... But my husband, Johnny Rocker, calmed me down, so I calmed down... I loved a girl and I told it right to her face... I loved a girl and I told it right to her face... Someone I loved... Someone I loved... a making of a movie is a long and exhausting process, but at the end of the day I felt content, because I'm doing what I love so much to do. I feel complete, as I've never felt before. Good luck, Tami! What a wonderful morning. We are awaiting the arrival of the star, Tami Gal. Why do we always have to wait for her? This is a case of a young woman who suffers rare delusions, which describes imaginary reality, in which she is a movie star. Although it is a broad range psychotic reality, I do not see indication for compulsory hospitalization. Nevertheless, there is a great anticipation anxiety towards the shootings of a new movie, in which she plays the leading role. Everything alright, Tami? Why does everything always have to be alright? No, of course not. It's a process, it takes time. But there is an improvement, right? - Yes. Did he say that? - Yes. The diagnosis: An exceptional case demanding long term drug therapy. Why don't the three of us go shopping, buy you some nice clothes? Would you stop it? - Just to get out of this madness... Stop it already! - Why? - Enough! Enough of what? You can't just say "enough" all day long! It's not good for you! Tell us what's bothering you and we'll help you. We only want what's best for you, Tami. But I don't want what's best for me. - What do you mean? I feel good when I don't feel good, and I don't when I do. And that's it, just leave me alone. Untreated, the prognosis is deterioration towards Poetic Schizophrenia. - Poetic? - DELUS IONS It's an interesting part. You've never done such character. A simple, ordinary girl. Tami, a call for you! Bring it over, I'm in the shower! She has enemies who try to harm her, but she needs to deal with them. Hello. Oh, hi, Eli... Especially her cousin, Ayala, who annoys her and plots against her, together with her mother. But Tami won't allow them to succeed... I'm fine, how are you? Yes, she's here, let me put her on. It's Eli. - Is this your phone? No, I just didn't want it to get disconnected. Did you sleep well, beautiful? - I slept fine. So, how was it? It was great. - It was, wasn't it? Ayala! Ayala! Say... - Shut up a second. Hi, it's so lucky you're here! I've got to get home. The keys in the den? Yes, you can take them. - Mika, wait, I've got to talk to you, it's urgent. Talk to me later. Listen, Avi, I mean, Eli, it's all very interesting, what you're saying, but I gotta go, so bye. Too bad, he actually looked like a pretty smart guy. Mika, Mika! Wait, you've got to help me! I can't go on like this! You're the only one who can save me from this boring life, I'm simply going crazy! - What are you talking about? Actually, there was someone here today. - That's nice. Maybe something will come out of it, finally. No, I don't think she's taking him seriously. Remember what you said, about inventing a fictitious celebrity? About that plan? - Yes? - And you didn't know who it's going to be? Yes? - So I thought it might be... Three letters, a masturbator? You! - So I thought it might be... me! What!? You think there's any improvement? - It's hard to say. Tami, your brain is flying around in your skull like a trapped bee. I can't plan anything seriously with you! I think it should be a person of quality, prominent against the backdrop of general shallowness. The ideal celebrity... Listen to this! Oded Kopelman was seen exiting a bookshop... Oded Kopelman! Who are you going to read all these books with? The deeds of the Kopelman are not of interest to the general public. But still? - To our correspondent's question, Kopelman replied... What is there to say that hasn't been said before? Nothing. You won't pry anything out of me, not an insight, nor a statement, not a message to the nation, and surely not some naked cliche? Oded Kopelman! Such a fascinating man! Am I not prominent enough against the backdrop of shallowness? Not enough. - Alright, look, if she's going to that psychiatrist anyway, shouldn't she at least do what he tells her to do? That's exactly what I told her. I'll never be famous. - We'll see, we'll see... Sure, Mika, sure. Think about it. You know you are my key, Mika. Keys are not really my forte. Alright, I'll tell her to hurry up, we'll be right out. Bye! Come on, Tami, let's go! She called, she's on her way already! I don't understand why she should be calling you. I don't know, she probably tried your number and you were unavailable. Tami! See? Available! Available! - OK, enough. Let's go, it's not nice, we're always late. Why are you so concerned? She's my mother, not yours! I can be late if I want to! You're so irresponsible, Tami! That's why she calls me and not you! Don't you dare talk to me this way. - I'll talk to you any way I please! And would you stop it already with this emotional blackmail? Don't you yell at me! - Of course I'll yell at you, you're not moving! If you really want to have this conversation, let's do it on the way. We won't have any... - Tami, stop it, don't talk back to me, just take your bag and let's get out of here! - Cut! Cut, cut. Ayala, would you come over here, please? Look, this isn't working out. I'm not feeling any improvement. Maybe I can help in any way? No you're just fine. - OK You shouldn't be so hostile, you should be much softer, make her love you. - Alright, I got it, I'll do it this way, OK? Don't worry, you'll see. No, no, no, Ayala, come here. Look... I don't think this is going to work. I think we're going to have to let you go. What? You can't kick me out just like that! We've shot the end scene already! I don't believe this! What are you going to do, replace me? Who are you going to get instead? Who? Ayelet, that was great. Let's do it again, from the moment Tami comes home. Action! Are you ready to go? I'm really not up to it now. - When are you up to anything? As a matter of fact, I'm usually not, but sure as hell not now. Let's call her and tell her to come back some other day. You don't say, and what could we tell her? Let's tell her we can't come, tell her that we're... sick. We'll bring her a note from my mother. I'm very happy that you're here Oh Darling stop it, stop it... Tourist? - No, we're actresses. What? - Movies. Movie stars. Really? Stars, huh? From where, Switzerland? Excuse me? - Oh, sorry, sorry. Where are you from? From are you? Oh, we're from... Southern Comfort. Yes, I know it, it's near Germania, right? Sorry, Germany. - Germany? Germany, yes! - Exactly. Exact, Germany, exact. I know Southern, very, very nice, Southern. - Yes, indeed. What's the matter with you? Drive! Crazy drivers, crazy. Here we are, this is Caf? Names. No, I wanted to go to Caf? Caf?, not to Caf? Names. What, it's not here? - No. Shit, these fucking tourists... Wait! Hey, come here a second! Where is Caf? Caf?? Fuck you! Great, now what? - What? Nothing, nothing. - What did you say? I mean nothing, "shum davar". Fucking tourists... Hey, you! Hey! Yeah, you! You know English? Who, me? - Come here a second, do me a favor. Fuck, it's Johnny Rocker! Come here. Look, I got these two tourists from Northern Comfort, I don't understand where they want to go. This sculpture is very... innovative. Yes, I like to be revolutionarily inventive. It reminds me of myself in high school. You gonna buy a paper or just drool? Hey, Avi, come here a second! - Just a second, John. So, girls, I didn't get what the driver said before. Where are you from? Oh, we're from... Southampton. - Oh, Southampton! Are you from Tel Aviv? - Yes, yes. This is my place, this is where I live. This is what I am. - Johnny, what did you want? We've got tourists here. - Look at them, double-dating on my buck! Tami? Avi? Unbelievable. - What was that? It's Tami Galfender, we went to high school together! - What? Are you putting me on? Is this some new fad, conning cab drivers? Don't we have enough trouble with terrorists and murderers? I'm sorry, it was a joke... - I'm not laughing! Alright? Get the hell outta my cab! - Alright, take your 10 shekels and be quiet. Go fuck yourself with your 10 shekels! Don't talk to me like that! Excuse me? - "Excuse me", my ass! - Ayala, it wasn't nice. Tell him that! Why is he taking it so hard? Gosh! Don't you tell me how to take it! Get out of my cab! You too, get out! And you, get out of the occupied territories! - What's your problem? Who are you, why are you talking to me? And what are you two doing here? Don't look at me like that, get out of my cab! - Don't get so mad, OK? Be cool, we're getting out! - I'm not mad, I'm not mad... This was great. - Yeah, good scene. I think I'll use it for my autobiography. Unbelievable! - It's just that I'm going to become famous soon... No, I mean I still can't get over seeing you here. Yeah, that's really weird, isn't it? You don't know how weird. In fact, I've been thinking about you lately. What were you thinking about? - I was thinking about... what happened between us. No, not like "why is it over", more like... what did it consist of, that thing we had, what kind of materials... - Hey, Avi, you've really changed, haven't you? That's right! It's amazing that you've noticed that! Is it so obvious? Hi, Mali. - Hi. Hi, Mali, how are you? - Fine. Mali, I've missed you so much! I haven't seen you for ages! Ayala, tell your cousin to stop playing the loving daughter. I've know her for too long for that. Why are you saying that, Mali? Here, I even brought you... a present. But you probably left it at home. - No, actually, I didn't. Here you go, enjoy. Tami, It's your cellphone. I'm not going to take it, am I? - Why not, Mother? It's a present. Now, I'd like to ask you two something. Seriously, OK? Do you think I'm weird? - Why? Because Avi thinks so. - Stop it! Who's Avi? Someone new? No, Avi Hacham, her boyfriend from high school... Doesn't matter who he is, forget it. Just dropped on me out of the blue with all kinds of nostalgia and riddles, and then said I was weird. Avi Hacham, you know... In other words, what kind of a relationship was it? In fact, I didn't understand it either, until recently. I mean, what version of Tami are you wrapping yourself in today, when you go out? Or what is the plot of your last episode? In God's name, what do you mean? I mean that... that you were... Weird in high school. - Me, weird? Tami. Avi, Avi Hacham, her boyfriend from high school... Hello, who is it? Eli? Why are you calling me here? No, I didn't have fun. No. Listen, I don't want you to call me anymore, I hope I'm making myself clear enough now, goodbye. Why are you always so mean to the guys you go out with? That's exactly what I told her. - Do you enjoy playing with people? People can feel it's not going anywhere serious. Can't you see? You are incapable of building anything meaningful! Exactly, because with her it's never beyond the level of a flirtation! So how can she... - She's simply too picky. And, she acts like she's allowed to do anything. I'll never get married. Oh, it's my husband, must be urgent. Just a second. Hi, Johnny! - Hi. Well, when are you coming? I miss you. What? - I said I missed you. Just a second! Shhh! What? Miss you, babe! Miss you! Got it? It looks like you're gonna get a part in the movie. - Really? That's great! Wow, wow! Ask them if they want me to write the soundtrack as well! I'm sure they'd like that. - I'm full of ideas. Wow, I could give them "Promenade Girls"! Wow, far out! Are you finished there at the caf?? - Not yet. I'll be back later. We've changed the lead actress today, remember? We need to shoot everything again. I'll talk to you later, sweetheart. Kisses! - Love you! - Me, too. Me, too. Bye. Now we can go on. Can't you see? You are incapable of building anything meaningful! Exactly, because with her it's never beyond the level of a flirtation! She's simply too picky. - Alright, Mali, enough of this pessimism, I want to tell you something that will cheer you up. Really? - Your daughter is going to date someone famous. Who, Avi Hacham? - No, his friend. Who? Johnny? - Yes, Johnny Rocker - Singer of the Year, Mother! Popular rock singer, Johnny Rocker, and his babe girlfriend Tami were seen exiting a very private party. Hey, how did she snag that guy? Hey, Johnny! - Yes? Who's the babe of the hour? Tami. - Well, it's still in first drive, but you can write it down: That I'm in love. In love, in love... He's in love! A tough break, girls. Johnny Rocker is taken! The planets, too, circle the sun, and every once in a while they meet. Then they remember that they've already met in the past, and go on, circling the sun. Do you want to make the call or don't you? No. - You don't want to make the call? No. - Then don't make the call, Avi. Hello. - Hello? Hello, Tami? - Who? No, no... Hi, how are you doing? It's Avi. - Hi, Avi, what's up? How is Johnny? He's fine. Say, did he have anything to say afterwards? - Actually, he did. What? - The fact is... he was pretty enthusiastic. Really, what did he say? He said... we both said, that you are pretty cute. Right from the start I saw he was pretty keen So I played along, to make him think I was happy to see him, at least as much as he was. Well? - Well what? It was obvious he was going to call me! And now what? - Now I'll get him in touch with his past, and he'll get me in touch with my future. And this future is Johnny? - It's worth mentioning, isn't it? Where, in my column? - Sweetcakes, forget the fictitious celeb plan! Yours truly is Johnny's latest and you're getting the exclusive! Are you gonna take it or not? - We'll see, we'll see. What's to see? - We'll see... what develops. Mika, you're s such a skeptic! Don't you know that all the celebrities were anonymous the second before they got their break? Alright then, I don't need you. I'll manage by myself and you'll be left all alone. What? You drink coffee to wake up! Ever asked yourselves why? I don't drink coffee! Do you know why? Because I'm awake! Waitress! I just wanted to say that the food here is not to my taste! Because the soul is missing in this place! And who am I? Huh? Who am I? Bunch of blabbermouths! Blah, blah! Blabbering face! Ridiculing friends! Each word for 20 cents! Where are the heads here? Where are the heads? On your head be it! But where are the heads? Sir, I must ask you to... - Ask? Say "please"! Such a cowshed! Watch out before cream will get you dead... Pass on this rumor! With two sweeteners! And not a gram of sugar! Shalom aleichem... A powerful explosive device was discovered near a downtown caf?, thanks to the vigilance of a guide dog... The dog, named Rex, pulled his blind master towards the device and began barking vigorously. The security forces disarmed the device. No casualties or property damage were reported. The following report has just reached the newsroom. One of the station's anchormen, namely Itamar Ben-Gal, was seen yesterday breaking into one of the coffeehouses in the city. With the staff trying to eject him, Ben-Gal climbed on a coffee table and began angrily rebuking the astonished patrons. This is the news from our newsroom! Itamar, you fuckhead, Porat will kill you! No, I'm just a tool! A symbol of the protest, of the revolution! Ben-Gal! You fucking moron! Where the hell do you think you are, a high-school radio station? What the hell was that supposed to mean? Nobody needs to hear over the news that Itamar Ben-Gal yells at people at a caf?? Or spills bleach at a supermarket, or that Itamar Ben-Gal... I don't know! Nobody gives a shit about you! Understand? I mean, nobody! Yes, Hezi, I'm sorry. I promise, it won't happen again. Mark my word, one more stunt like this, and I promise you that I will personally see to it that you are out of here like a rocket and the only news you'll read will be the specials at a supermarket! So, Itamar Ben-Gal, watch your fucking step! I don't understand why you do this to yourself. I really don't. I'm ready to do whatever it takes Hey, Itamar, I saw your picture in the paper. Where? - The society page. Which paper? I don't remember which paper, some paper! - Have you got it here? No, I saw it at a newsstand earlier. Alright, I gotta go. Nobody cares who I am or what I think about the twaddle I read over the radio all the time. - This is Itamar Ben-Gal - Who am I? Who am I? - The popular rock singer, Johnny Rocker - - and his babe girlfriend Tami were seen exiting a very private party. - - Oded Kopelman - my fictitious celebrity - - Mika's world - Look who you write about in your column! And I'm not good enough for you? You are not an extra in this play. You are Itamar Ben-Gal... Itamar Ben-Gal Revolution!!! Take them out. - This is Itamar Ben-Gal - You know that what you are doing is simply vandalism. Vandalism is writing stuff like this. I just prevent this violence from happening in reality. See, how weird she was... She was very different. So, Johnny, do you bring a new girl here every day? No. As a matter of fact, no. I mean, there was a time, but lately I've been looking for something more meaningful. Really? - Yes. Look, I've always loved women, alright? But now I feel I've grown more mature. I have tasted love. Say, Avi, Johnny has really matured, right? Yes. Johnny is serious now. He reads a lot of books, too. - Really? What kind of books? Everything. Even some that nobody's ever heard of. Like in that song, "Someone I Loved". "Someone I Knew". - Yes, "Someone I Knew". Hey, I see you know the songs! Here. Do you remember how it goes? I knew a girl and I told it right to her face... Listen to this, she knows all the words! First, a superstar cup of coffee for Ayala, the number one groupie. Never mind, it's a joke. Someone I Knew... She was... Someone I knew... Hey, that's some song! - You know, I heard your song today on the radio. You've really become a leftist, right, Johnny? To say this song is leftist... is simply reducing it! We don't think the song is political or not political. No, no, no, I'm not saying it's a bad thing. We're very left-wing too. See what I'm talking about? Do you see what I'm talking about?! Look, "Right is Not Left" was written last year, obviously... But what's really great about it is, that it fits any period in the history of the country. - Well said. This song was successful not because of the political situation. It wasn't that at all! It was simply because it's a good song! We believe in the power of good songs. Do you know why? Because I believe in one thing: When a song is good, it's good. And it doesn't matter if it's a song of protest or a love song for your dog. Amen! - In my opinion, this song says that we have to look at things above the level of politics and not through it. And this connects it with that other song of yours, "If You Will, It's Not an Agenda", that says that Zionism is an outdated movement that has lost its direction, and all that. Hey! I can see we're on the same vibe here! Of course. You are on a universal vibe. Listen, I've got to show you something I'm working on now. Want to come with me a second? Avi, is the multi on? - Yes. Come with me a second. Come here. - OK. Ayala, we're in a hurry! Alright, alright, I know! The moment I saw you, I recognized you had the potential to be the double agent of the revolution! But what for? - What do you mean, what for? For the revolution! What exactly is your directive? - What are you, a detective? No, simply poetic inventive. Isn't being salesman enough? I aspire for more in life. I wish you luck, in conclusion. - I'm sorry for the intrusion, were you serious about the revolution? No, No, we are only kidding. Too bad, I'm quite fittin. You are much better at snacks selling. Don't say no, I have experience! Let's find another store of convenience! What's wrong with this, it's uncool? This man is simply a fool! If you're not here to buy, get off my stool! Some fucking revolution... - This is Itamar Ben-Gal - Nobody knows what to do, nobody knows Exactly! This is exactly what I'm saying! - You don't need to yell. People are confused, because everyone knows we're tangled up with them and we just need someone to come and untie this knot already, but nobody knows how to do it. Do you remember what a neurotic wreck I was? Remember how in Miriam Zafir's class I stole her "stress ball" she used to play with all the time, and threw it at... No, not Dikla, what was her name? I don't remember. - The girl that sat with Udi... Orli? - No! Orli sat with Efrat. I mean the one whose father is a psychologist... Dana, maybe... Doesn't matter. Was The point is that I was neurotic, but I've changed... This is supposed to carry on the momentum of "Right is Not Left"? Exactly. You see, I feel I am at a point of power, you understand? Like it's a one-time opportunity, because people really listen to me now. I feel that in concerts, the real kick in the head comes from... The lyrics. - The lyrics! I don't believe it! The dialogue with the audience! Understand? - Exactly. Now what? Anyway... - Anybody could get there, it's not like... There's someone at the door. - Yeah, just a second. Like, I feel that as an artist, I must do something about it, see? Sure. Of course I see, but it's not that simple. Johnny! Johnny! - Just a second, Avi! What were you saying, it's not all that... what? Like, to say something unambiguous, you have to take a risk. Not everyone is prepared... - Johnny, one moment. - What? Would you like to make a donation for autistic children? Yes, sure. Tell them, later, to come back later. Alright, we'll come back later. I'm sorry, he interrupted you. What were you saying? You said something really important, that I... - Must take a risk. Take a risk, of course! You gotta take risks, understand? Anyway, when I saw you, you seemed to me somehow pretty much the way you were in high school, kinda weird. And then I realized that I must look the same way to you! And if I underwent this far-reaching change... You must have changed too. Tami, is everything alright? - Yes, yes, fine. Are you sure? Because I can feel that something is wrong. Don't touch me! Tami, if there is something wrong, just say so. I'm normal! Perfectly normal! Are you sure? Yes... Anyway, what I wanted to say was that if you went through the same process, and now I'm sure you did, and I know this for myself, and it's absolutely certain, then this is exactly what I'm talking about, People change, I mean, it's obvious that there is something here, you know, things that are natural, that... - Avi! Leave me alone! Alright? We're really in a hurry! Where are you rushing off to? They haven't finished yet. What do they have to finish so much? I'm going to tell them to come out. Come on, how long does it take? - Why, was it long? Very. What exactly are you doing there? Cutting a new album? Alright, Ayala, let's go, I'm tired of this. Tami, let me just put them back, and I'll come to say goodbye. It's just that I wanted to tell you we're going to grab a bite somewhere. What? I can't believe you're doing this to me! Alright, don't take it so hard... Sure, go, enjoy yourself, you must be very hungry. I don't want to get in the way. Ok. We start shooting. Actors to first position. It's best that they both start by walking. Tami, It is a complicated scene. - OK. Stay concentrated. Are you ready? - Just a sec. - Yes, yes. Johnny, are you ready? Ready! Good luck, everybody! Tami. Go girl. Action! I'm not ready. I can't do it... I'm sorry. I'm sure you can handle it. Action! What do you want? It's not very nice, you promised we'd come back together, and then I find myself alone here! Tami, don't try to manipulate me now. We just said we'd go to their place and come home later. You don't have to make it look like broken promises and broken trust. It's so insulting that... - Now you're looking for an excuse to be offended? I think you just want to make me feel bad, to get back at me, because Johnny... - What? Never mind. - Never mind what? Never mind, we'll talk about it later. Alright, we'll talk about it later. See you. - Bye. Tami, Avi is asking if it's alright if he calls you tomorrow? Sure, great. - Alright. Is she alright? Anyway, you know, I've tried a lot of things, what didn't I try? I tried sleeping over at my friends, reading a lot, hitchhiking, another great moment was when I went down to Eilat... Have you ever been to Eilat? - Yes. The people there, they just made me open myself up, understand? They made me open up my mind, my stomach, my heart. They taught me that the most important thing for me was simply... - Ayala! Ayala! What? - Come over here a second. What? - I just want to tell you something. What is it? - Just come over a second! It's alright, go. - Alright, but I'll be right back. I'll be waiting. But I'm a little hungry, alright? Go on, talk. I just wanted to tell you that I'm sorry. This Avi, he just made me go nuts, I couldn't stand listening to him for another moment. Just so you know, what you think about me is not true. I know. I'm sorry. So, peace? - Peace. Oh, sweetheart... Well... - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Wow... Eilat... Ayala? Ayala? Ayala? Is that you? - No, it's me. Oh, hi, Mika. I was just looking for you. I wanted to give you an update, about Johnny. Why, is he there? - No, I'm alone now. Where is Ayala? She's not home? - No, she hasn't come back yet. Where is she, this time of night? I don't know. I think she went for a bite. Mmm, yummy! - Anyway, Mika, I just wanted to tell you that everything is going according to plan. - Aha! Really. I'm just back from Johnny's, he'll probably come over tomorrow. That's it. Looks like I'm entering your column through the main door. Great. So, you can put it in this week's issue. I don't know. - But Mika, you promised. I didn't promise anything, I said, we'll see. Anyway, I'm sick of all these pretentious Johnny Rockers. Besides. I decided to make a change in the column. But Mika, it's wrong! This is what people like to read! No, it's not wrong. It's reality. Ow, Mika... - Ow, Tami... Tami, meet Itamar. Ben-Gal! Itamar Ben-Gal! Isn't there some radio anchorman called Itamar Ben-Gal? Yes, there is! - He means to say it's him. Yes, he really does look familiar. Bye. Strange. - Yes, it is strange. What's strange? That she couldn't tell by my voice I was Itamar Ben-Gal. Oh, she's not a radio person, she's more a TV person. Never mind, it's alright. Everyone will know soon enough. Know what, Itamar? They'll finally know that the really significant medium is the radio! And not the shallow technology of this flat screen, filled with all kinds of caricatures of reality! I say that what we need to do now is that you sing something and then we'll play with it a little with the computer. We could stick her in after the drums. Alright, go answer the phone. - Look, I don't really have a voice... You don't need a voice with the computer. You don't understand what we're doing... Hello, Tami! Hi! - Let me talk to Ayala. Hello? - Hi, where are you? Right, you're at Johnny's... Tami, this is Avi. Look, I just wanted you to know that I really don't understand why don't you want me, and that you'd better grow up a little... Remember, we talked about a plan that would save the situation? Yes? - So, I had an idea. - Well? To invent a celebrity and insert him into the columns. An ideal celebrity, prominent against the general backdrop of shallowness. - Right is Not Left - - Psychiatric - Johnny! Johnny! Sure, my pleasure. I'm not really sure whether to base it on some real character. And if so, on whom? - What do you mean, on whom? On me! Me! Tami, hi, this is Avi. Listen, I just wanted to know if this was final. But why? Hold on a second, why? Is it because I'm not prepared to declare I'm a leftist? What is it? Alright, I'll wake her. She will go to her room No, don't wake her, let's go to my place. Hello. - Johnny, let me talk to Ayala. Alright, Tami, just a second. Tell her not to call here anymore, this is starting to annoy. What's wrong? Thanks! Don't mention it! You know, every time I fall in love, I feel the need to say thanks for the privilege to know the female species from up close. You know, this is what my most political song is about, "Woman Is Right Now". - Oh, yeah? Yeah. Say, do you think, it's good to be aware of what makes you feel good... ...aware of what makes you feel good? Like, what? You're asking if awareness harms spontaneity? - Yes, exactly! Like everything that... Where were we? - Like everything that has to do with love. Then this need to constantly define to yourself what you're feeling doesn't allow you to get carried away. Yes, I understand what you're saying... Alright, enough is enough! What the hell? Gosh! - Guys, what's going on? I can't work like this, Benny, I'm sorry! What do you think you're doing? How am I supposed to create an intimate scene here... A cigarette, please! When you shove this furry thing in my face? I asked for a cigarette! When you stick this furry thing in my face! What do you think... Oh, sorry! Pervert... Gimme a light! Have you ever seen two people in bed with each other, with some Benny standing over them with this furry stick, and some Uri with a mixer... - Yuri. Alright, Yuri, with a mixer and headphones! Alright, calm down, we're all professionals here... - Don't touch me! Oh, yeah? Fine. Just so you know, there are a lot of actresses who would kill to be in your place! Alright? - You don't say! Yes. - I saw what you got to offer all those actresses! Big deal! Hey! This is what happens when you hire fourth-rate actresses! See? And you expect me to work with them? I work only with Tami! Only Tami! I've had it with this movie! You people make me sick! God damn it! Then there is a situation where you are aware of being carried away and you still allow yourself to get carried away... Well said... - Thanks. Can I come in? - Just a second! Hi. I'm making coffee. You two want some? No, we don't feel like it. Ask Johnny, maybe he wants some. Why are you starving him. Johnny, want some coffee? - No, thank you! Alright, I'll put the kettle on. I'll be right back. Shit... She is awful. I don't know what to do with her. I can't understand how you can live like that? To tell you the truth, I'm just dying to leave. I'm telling you it's sucks. Get a grip on yourself. This isn't what you think. You are warm, you are good, you are giving, control yourself... I bought some incredible nut coffee. Do you want some, Or do you prefer vanilla? Cut, cut! Lights! Alright, this isn't working. Take a break. Would somebody fix Benny something to drink? Yeah, that would be nice. - Take five. Idiot! Just so you know, I wanted to do this scene with you. I told the director... Excuse me, sweetheart. Did you see that? She doesn't even have the tits for the part! See? But you've got the tits, they're beautiful. You know, you and I would have made this a great scene. You can take the set down, we're moving on to the hallway scene. Alright, Tami, I'll talk to you tomorrow. Bye. Bye, Tami! Ayala! Ayala! - What? Didn't we say we'd do something tonight? What? We said we'd catch a movie. - Well, we'll go some other time. We can't, it's the last week it's playing. Do you really need me to come? Alright, never mind, I don't need you. - Come on, Tami... Forget it, don't come, I don't need you. Let her go, let her go. Is it really that important to you? - Yes! I've cancelled a lot of plans for this. - Oh, yeah? What did you cancel? - All kinds of stuff. What difference does it make? Besides, you promised you'd come and I expect you to... - I didn't promise, I said we'd see... I don't understand why you can't come with me. - What's there to understand? Why is it that when you want to go somewhere, I can cancel all my plans, and when I ask you to do one little thing for me, you can't be bothered! - What are you talking about? You'd think you haven't seen him for a month. Alright, we'll talk about it later. - I don't want to! Tami, we will talk about it later. - I don't want to! We'll talk about it later? - Later? Like the other day, when you said you'd be back later? And I stayed up all night waiting for you! I don't need you to wait for me! This is so selfish of you. - Would you leave her alone already? Shut up! - Tami! What's up? I got confused here. You're crazy! - People are waiting for you, because you promised them! And you don't need them to wait! - Alright, Tami. Calm down, don't take it so hard... I'll be back and we'll talk about it, alright? Don't worry. How can I not worry? I don't know what you're doing, I don't know where you are, who you're with, where you go, I worry about you so much... I think about you all the time... There are terrorists around, Ayala. - Alright, calm down. Come on, stop it, it's gonna be fine. You don't need to worry about me so much. Come on. That's it, see? Now I gotta go. But I'll be back, I'll be back later and we'll talk about it and work everything out... OK? Sure, go, leave me like this... Tami, what do you want me to do? Hi! It's so good you're home, because I really have to... Oh, what an honor, Johnny Rocker, as I live and breathe... Meow. - Hi, Mika, what' up? Cool, everything's cool. Am I disturbing you? Alright, don't mind me, I'll just take my keys and... Tami, I see this is getting serious. Maybe I will actually write about you in the paper, after all. Bye... You're lucky I'm against violence. You're real lucky that I'm against violence, just so you know. Just so you know. Hello. Is now a good time? We've already donated at home. God damn it... - Itamar Ben-Gal's vehicle of the revolution - - This is Itamar Ben-Gal - Maybe I'll just come with you? What about your mother? Isn't she waiting for you at the store? Oh, yeah, that's right. Damn, I really don't feel like going shopping with her right now. I hate going shopping alone with my mother. Mika, would you come with me? No, no, I've got to get to the editorial. Why? - They really pissed me off this time. They didn't like my new ideas about the fictitious celebrity. Looks like I don't have a choice, I have to write about you and Johnny. About who? - Tami and Johnny... Tami and Johnny? - Why, is there a problem? Well... No, doesn't matter... Johnny... he's with Ayala now. What? What was that? It's not enough you're having laughs at cab drivers' expense, now you're trying to con a society writer on duty? Do I look like an idiot? You two won't con me with your kinky stories! Swinging inside the family, threesomes with rock stars... Nothing doing, girls, Mika Tevet won't be deceived! Oh, really? - Let me off here, Mika. Don't you want to get off at the library? - No, never mind, I'll take a shortcut from here, it's a two-minute walk. Are you sure? Because if you want me to, I could... No, no, I'll walk from here, it's two minutes. Hey, are you going uptown by any chance? We're going to meet my mother, is that good for you? Can't you see they need to go the other way? Sorry! Too bad, they looked pretty hot. Ayala! It's like in Johnny's song, "The Promenade Girls". The promenade girls, each one is different... She's nuts! I almost printed an item about it, with a picture! She's been driving me crazy lately. I'm afraid it's only going to get worse. - Isn't it bad enough already? Looks like Johnny and I are moving in together. - What? I'm really afraid to tell her. She doesn't know yet? - No, not yet. This Tami is really fucked up. How could she think she was with him in the first place? I have to tell her before... - She finds out for herself. Mika, don't you say a word! - Of course not! You probably won't believe me and it may come as a surprise, but Johnny proposed to me. Tami! Four letters, and had it with you! Mika What's with you, Tami? You won't let facts affect your reality? "A report from Chechnya: 25 acres of forest land are on fire. "In the intense fighting, entire forests burn to the ground." And now, to the local revolution in blue and white. A popular radio personality Itamar Ben-Gal threw down a gauntlet before the dictatorship of the routine and announced the beginning of the Al-Routine Intifada. Yesterday afternoon Ben-Gal marched through the city streets, proudly wearing a shirt with his own image. Circling the streets, he surprised his many admirers who didn't know what the object of their adulation looked like. The crowd of late risers that thronged to him and accompanied him on his march, chanted slogans like "Go, go, Itamar", and "The revolution finally has a face". Take him off the air! Take him off! Why is he still talking? Take him off already! Where the hell is the technician? He went to the bathroom. - Call him back here, now! Dear listeners, you should know that at this hour, efforts are being made to take me off the air. However, we shall remain here, as usual, a clear and lucid voice. The revolution, led, as you already know, by Itamar Ben-Gal and his new girlfriend, the classy society writer, Mika Tevet! In the course of this eventful week, the indomitable pair of masterminds are planning a massive information attack on the various newspapers, with notes of Ben-Gal's activities on the revolutionary front... Where the hell is the technician, man? - This is Itamar Ben-Gal - He's insane! - I am absolutely sane. I mean, breaking down conventions... And I will not allow any slave of the hegemony... Pull the rug from underneath... Take him off... Take him off... This is just the beginning. We are not slaves. We won't let anybody undermine the revolution. That's it, he's off. I have to go there. - But be back later. Alright, we'll see. We'll see. - Don't leave me alone, Mika. Alright already, we'll see! Come down, Hezi, they can't hear him anymore. Calm down! Hezi, they can't hear him! Hezi! They can't hear him, Hezi, we've taken him off the air! To all our listeners... Please accept my apologies. This is Hezi Fullman, deputy director of the station, announcing that he's been fired! Please stay tuned. One thing for sure, they won't forget you there any time soon. Won't forget me? They won't stop remembering! It's not everyday that you reach this kind of audio-phonic height, and live, too! What are you going to do in the meantime? What do you mean? In the meantime, we have the newspaper. What newspaper? - Your newspaper. That's just it, the truth is, I wanted to tell you that... That I've thought about it and... It looks like I'm going to leave there. Are you insane? No, it's just that I can't see myself writing any more of this... But Mika, what about the revolution? - We will carry it on! But not from there. It's no good. Mika, you're wrong. Do you understand it's wrong? Do you? It's not wrong. It's reality. Mika, as long as we have the paper, and we don't have anything else, it leaves us in the picture! - What picture? Picture-shmicture. Hello? - Ayala, sweetheart, what's going on? Are you coming? Maybe later. How is she? Alright? Not really. I don't think the therapy is working. Can't be, it must work. She just probably doesn't go there enough. Tell her she must do whatever the psychiatrist tells her. So why don't you come here and tell her yourself? How about this? - It's not you. As a matter of fact, Mali, I'm pretty fed up with this. She just wore me out completely. Hold on, she's asking for you. - No, tell her I'll talk to her later... Hello, where are you? Why didn't you come? I'm... still at the library. Oh, come on, I need you to come. Don't be like that. I don't know, Tami. Please, Ayala. Don't leave me alone! Please! Alright. Alright, I'll come. Bye. What's with this thing? Well, you know. It's a sensitive subject with her. I don't want to get in trouble over this. - What trouble? Being with me, means getting in trouble? - It's got nothing to do with you! It's not... Never mind, let's talk about it later. Later? Occupation is bad! Peace is good! Let's get out of here. I see their signs and don't want to get into it. Why not? They'll be very happy if we'll come over and give them our support! And if that makes them make some changes in their lives, then, hey, we've done it! Avi, I've told you a thousand times, I don't support anyone. I am an individual. Understand? An individual! You can't be an individual your whole life, it doesn't work like that. There comes a time when you must get up and tell the truth right out, you must make a stand! - Tell the truth? Make a stand? You are telling me? You, telling me?! You can't compare these things, it's not the same! Of course it's not the same! In your case it's a lot easier! But Johnny, she's right. We just need to go over there and tell everybody, like, what we think. Tell the truth right out. Avi, you need to grow a spine. I've told you a thousand times, I've got my principles and I don't do protests, understand? It's too concrete! Too simplistic! Yes, but just so you know, that is the reason she left me. What reason? - That I don't say what I think, and this is what I think. I wish that was the reason, Avi, that could be fixed. Stop it, it's not nice... Oh, yeah? Then I'll have you know that you are conceited. Just because you're a part of the herd, doesn't mean I'm conceited. You'd better watch out, Johnny! - Why, what are you gonna do about it? What, are you gonna tell me I remind you of yourself in high school? No, I'll just go. Wait! Hold on a second! Avi, hold on, will you? You are wrong, Johnny. And don't tell me it's not wrong, because this is reality! See? This is telling the truth right out! - You're right. I'm serious! - Alright, alright... Come on, let's get out of here. Pull over, I need to buy some cigarettes. Get me some, too... sweetie. Give me a pack of Marlboros and Marlboro Lights, please. I'm sorry, this is fake. Aren't you making a mistake? This is a forgery, through and through. I can't believe it, it cannot be true! I know my forgeries, but not this brand. I don't understand it, I got this from a friend. Just get another bill and that will be the end. Is an apology a solution? I think you're delaying a revolution. Occupation is bad! Peace is good! Occupation is bad! Peace is good! Yes, this is another tedious protest rally by the left... With me is Anastasia, who came to this protest... Anastasia, why have a protest yet again? We must carry on, never stopping, until we reach peace, until we achieve peace! But today we see reality looking us squarely in the eye and telling us that the Oslo Accords are dead... That Rabin is dead, that there is nothing to be done... Look, it's Johnny Rocker! - This is Johnny Rocker! Get his picture. A sensation, ladies and gentlemen! Johnny Rocker is here! I'm out of here! Can't you wait? - No, I gotta run! Take the key, then! I'll wait for you at home! Bye! Johnny! Johnny! Johnny! Mika! Come on, will you? Mother... - What? I feel lonely. - Why don't you buy yourself a cat, Tami? Isn't that Mika? Hey, Mika. Hi, Mika. Hi. - What's up? That's it, I left the paper. Are you nuts? - I told you, I can't see myself writing anymore of this... Hold on a second. Did you have time to write about me and Johnny? No, I didn't. Tami? Mika, this leaves us out of the picture completely. What picture, Tami? Do me a favor! Picture-shmicture! Tami! - Just a second, Mother. Johnny Rocker, Singer of the Year. Have you come to express your support for the Israeli left? For the leftist street? - Yes, indeed. Look, I'm much more in tune now with the vibe of the street. It's very important to me to pick up on the things that are going on around me, you know? He's one of us! - This is exactly what I wrote in my song... "Right is Not Left"! - No, there are some other songs on that album, it's called "If You Will, It's Not an Agenda". So, in fact, by coming here today you say to the people of Israel, I am Johnny Rocker and I am a leftist. No, no, you should listen to the words of my songs. I don't categorize myself like that. - Are you right-wing? What are talking about, right-wing! No way! - Wait a second, listen! I don't place myself in any distinct political category. Let's get off this subject, It's pissing me off. You don't categorize yourself, yet you come to a leftist demonstration. Forget it, we'll get him categorized, don't you worry! - No, guys! Listen to my songs! In the words of my songs I say everything, I don't want you to put me up on any pedestals here, because I'm apolitical, you see? I'm apolitical! Enough talk, Johnny! - The street says, enough talk, Johnny. What do you say to the street? - That this is not the time for me to become political. This is not the time. And I think that, first of all, I am a poet, you know? First of all, I'm a poet. - Enough of that bullshit! Shut the fuck up! Get your hands off me! I'm against violence! We're all as one! You asshole, we're all as one! The unexpected arrival of this year's Singer of the Year, Johnny Rocker, to this left-wing demonstration has surprised all of us here, and not less surprisingly, created an atmosphere of violence. I'm against violence! What about Johnny and Ayala? - I don't know. What do you mean? You're supposed to know! - I don't know, Tami! Leave me alone. Ask Ayala. Ask her what? - I don't know, really. Ask her. I don't want to say anything else, just ask her. Ask her later, Tami. Let's go already! Hold on, Mother! Well, what's the story? - Tamar! What?! - Let's go! She's completely insane... Hold on, Mother. Just a second. I'll come later, OK? What later? What later?! I'm not going there alone! Alright then, go! Go on, get out of here! I don't want to come! Well? - You can stay if you want, but I'm not going to pay anymore for your therapy. Well? - I'll talk to you later. No, no, you're not going anywhere. Look at me, don't leave me like this. I'll talk to you later. Mika! Mika, wait. Mika! Hold on a second, Mika! Mika! Mika, hold on a second. - Itamar, leave me alone, I have to go. Where? - Just go. Come on, I'll take you! - No, thanks. Maybe some other time. - Wait! Let's talk, alright? Enough, I can't do it anymore! - I don't understand, is it something I did or what? Mika, we're good together, you and I. - I don't think so. So you're just dumping me like this, without an explanation? I have to go. But Mika... I love you. I love you, too. - Wait then! Mika, hold on! You forgot your keys! Alright, you can go. Go, leave your job, find yourself another job! Be like the rest of these petty, narrow-minded people! I don't need you anymore! I can hack it alone! You will see who Itamar Ben-Gal really is! Everybody will see who Itamar Ben-Gal really is, because Itamar Ben-Gal... is me!!! Kopelman? Ayala! Now you decided to show up? What took you so long? Did you leave her alone? - Yes. But she's really fragile right now. You know she can't be alone! She drove me crazy, I just couldn't stand her puerile nonsense anymore. I don't think it's puerile. I think something is really going on there. I asked you to keep an eye on her. What can I do? She must do what the doctor tells her! Don't bullshit me. You're just making her nervous and then she has to go to all kinds of dumb shrinks who screw her up completely. Come on! - How are you? - Not good! I'm on my way, I'm on my way. I'll be right there. Where are you? What's taking you so long? I got tied up, doesn't matter. I'll tell you when I get there. Where are you? Still at the store? Never mind, forget it. You don't have to come. Where are you? I can't hear you, you sound very far away... Very funny. Mika told me you had something to tell me. Really? What about? - About Johnny. So, it's true, then? That you've got something to tell me? More or less, I just... It's a little difficult for me to be with you lately. Fine, what's that got to do with Johnny's apartment? - What? What did Mika tell you? She just said you had something to tell me about Johnny's apartment. That's it? - Yes. What else? That we are, apparently, moving in together. Tami! Tami, are you alright? Tami, are you alright? Don't touch me. - Tami, relax. I don't want to see you anymore. - Tami, come on. I know it happened too fast, but... You've got a boom in the frame! - What? Can't you see? There's a boom! We can't go on like this. We need another take. Alright. Don't be ridiculous. - Don't talk to me ever again. I'm just moving to another house, don't make such a bit deal out of it! It shouldn't happen here. This is not happening here. Alright, it just happened, really. Don't make such a fuss about it. I got you. I got you back then. What are you talking about? What do you think? That I didn't see you climbing all over him back there? You've got such a dirty mind! At least I don't move in with every idiot who thinks he's something! What? You wanted him for yourself a second ago, and now he's a idiot? Who wants him? He's nothing! You disgust me, Tami. I disgust you? Me? You'll kiss anybody's feet for a little attention! Alright, I'm not stooping down to your level. This is jealousy talking. That's not it at all! You don't understand anything! What do you want from me, then? Why are you doing this to me? Yes Tami, I can't do it. - Come on, answer me. I don't know if I can. - You can't give up on this scene. It's a once-in-a-lifetime part. - That's it? You've got nothing else to say to me? But we didn't rehearse it. - So what? You did great at the audition. I don't know. - You are great. Don't worry, you are great. Well? - Who do you like to be with best? Him or me? - What? Who is more important to you? Me or him? I don't prioritize! - You mean, him. That's not true. - Don't you like being with me? Of course I do! I like being with you, I like it more than anything. But you know, lately... I know, I know, you don't have to tell me. I know I gave you a hard time. I just was under a lot of pressure lately, but it's over now. You'll see, I won't make another one of my scenes ever again, alright? Alright. - So you're staying? I can't. I want to move. I don't understand. I don't understand it, I don't... Don't you understand? - What? Don't you understand how blind you are? - Why am I blind? What do you think? Can't you see, he's just using you! No. He found himself a convenient solution, that cleans by day, and then you can fuck it by night. Ayala, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it, it's what they told me to say, it's their fault! What? - Don't go. - Forget it. There really is nothing to talk about. You know what? Go. Go on, get out of here! Who needs you? Come over here, you know what? Wait, let me help you! We're going to pack up all your ugly clothes and then I'm throwing them the hell out! Alright? For your information, I'm not taking the drugs you told him to give me, because I know it's all you and my mother plotting behind my back, how to humiliate me, how to make me feel alone! Alright, Tami, I'll talk to you tomorrow, OK? If you go, I'll never speak to you again in my life. I'll talk to you tomorrow! - Don't go! Wait a second, hold on! What? I just wanted to... I'm going. Don't go! Wait! Tami! Leave me alone. - I'm sorry! Ayala. Wait! I said I was sorry! I said I was sorry, you cunt! Don't go! I said I was sorry! They didn't tell me it would happen like this... Nobody told me this is the way it is. She shouldn't have left. It's not in her contract, that she leaves! I have to talk to my agent. She can't leave! I'm the main character! What kind of an ending is it, if she leaves? - "A moment before the dream" - What kind of an ending is it... Cut! Wrap! We've got a wrap! That's it, we're done! You can start taking the set down, everybody! You were wonderful! You carried the entire film on your back, I'm so proud of you! I can't wait to work with you again. Tami, you are huge. Bottoms up! Tami, I wrote a complimentary piece about you! You shouldn't have. - Yes, I should. I want to tell you something. We were great! Real stars! Ladies and gentlemen! At this moment we have successfully concluded the filming. I would like to thank the one person who made this film - Tami Gal! Bravo! Come on, don't be so modest! Mark my word, she'll get an Oscar for this! She's a star! A star! I'll see you all at opening night!
