EVERY 350,000 YEARS, THE COMET, BAY-LEDER 7, PASSES EARTH SO CLOSELY, IT CAN BE SEEN WITH THE NAKED EYE. TONIGHT, THE WAIT IS OVER. ASTRONOMERS ARE TELLING US THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE THE COMET... YOU KNOW, DAD, MOST MEN WHO ARE HAVING A HUGE PARTY, THROWN IN THEIR HONOR, WOULD BE AT THE PARTY ENJOYING IT AND NOT STANDING ON THE BALCONY LOOKING AT BIRDS. ANNA, BAY-LEDER 7 IS MAKING ITS CLOSEST PATH TO EARTH, AND I'M WATCHING FROM A BALCONY, NOT FROM A TELESCOPE. THAT'S THE PRICE YOU PAY FOR DISCOVERING IT. - I DIDN'T DISCOVER IT. YEAH, THE INSTITUTE DID... THAT'S CLOSE ENOUGH. ECKER PUT THAT AWAY. Sergeant Parker, it looks like we have a breach of security on the third floor... two unidentified subjects. ALL RIGHT, THIS IS PARKER. I'M ON IT. OVER. BETWEEN THE INSTITUTE, YOUR CHARITY WORK, AND POLITICS, IF YOU DON'T START TAKING TIME TO RELAX, YOU'RE GOING TO GET A HEART ATTACK, AND THEN THERE WILL BE NO ONE AROUND YOU TO RUN IT. - YES, THERE WILL. - WHO? ME? THE STAFF LOVES YOU AND RESPECTS YOU. - WHAT ABOUT HINTZE? HINTZE IS A BRAVE MAN, BUT HE HAS NO VISION. HE'S NOT LIKE YOU. - I JUST... THEY KNOW, DAD. I'M NOT A LEADER. - YOU MIGHT BE SURPRISED. UH, EXCUSE ME, THIS AREA IS RESERVED FOR EMBASSY STAFF. I'M SORRY. WE'RE JUST HAVING A CLOSER LOOK AT THE COMET. I'M SORRY, DR. STARNDORF. I DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS YOU. UH, THIS IS CAPTAIN PARKER. YEAH, I FOUND OUR STRAYS. IT'S DOCTOR STARNDORF AND HIS DAUGHTER. - They're cleared. - YEAH, I'VE GOT IT. OVER. DR. STARNDORF, PLEASE, STAY AS LONG AS YOU LIKE. WHEN YOU'RE READY, I'LL ESCORT YOU BACK TO THE PARTY. - UH, MISTER...? PARKER... CAPTAIN TOM PARKER, SIR. SO, CAPTAIN PARKER, WHY DON'T YOU JOIN US? I MEAN, THE BAY-LEDER IS SO CLOSE FROM HERE AS IF I'M... I'M SORRY. STARNDORF. WHAT? BUT THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE. YEAH, I'LL BE RIGHT THERE. COME ON, ANNA. I'M SORRY. - CERTAINLY, SIR. - GOODBYE, CAPTAIN PARKER. - BYE-BYE. - Hello? - SANDRA PARKER? YES, WHAT ARE YOU WEARING? - OH, IT'S TOO BAD, YOU KNOW? I WAS EXPECTING A CALL FROM MY SECRET LOVER. UH, NO, NO. I'M AFRAID HE'S BEING TORTURED TO DEATH RIGHT NOW. - WELL, I GUESS THAT MEANS I'M GONNA JUST GET MYSELF ANOTHER ONE. THAT MEANS YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO MAKE DO WITH ME, HONEY. I'LL MAKE DO WITH YOU THIS EVENING. All right, I'm working. I got to go. KISS THE PRINCESS FOR ME. YEAH, SHE'S JUST ABOUT READY FOR BED. - ALL RIGHT, I LOVE YOU. - YOU TOO. BYE. SIR, OUR CALCULATIONS WERE CORRECT... UP UNTIL THREE HOURS AGO. - WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL ME SOONER? YOU'RE MY CHIEF ENGINEER, HINTZE. I THOUGHT IT WAS A SYSTEM ERROR. THE BAY-LEDER'S TRAJECTORY HAS CHANGED. - GRAVITATIONAL SPIKE FROM EARTH? - PROBABLY. IT LOOKS LIKE AN IN-SPACE COLLISION WITH AN UNCHARTED ASTEROID... IT HIT IT HARD ENOUGH TO PUSH IT OFF-COURSE. WHATEVER THIS IS, THIS IS JUST GREAT. OKAY, LET'S RECALCULATE THE COURSE. - NO, NO, NO. NO, THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE. - OH, MY GOD. - HOW MUCH TIME? GET NASA ALONG WITH EVERY GOVERNMENT IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE ON THE LINE. I SHALL CALL COLONEL WATERS. - HONEY? HONEY. HI. HI, SWEETHEART. - TELL ME THIS ISN'T HAPPENING. - EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY. CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND? - YEAH. - BE RIGHT BACK. - WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK, SWEETIE. GENTLEMEN, WE ARE ON A VERY TIGHT SCHEDULE TODAY. - COLONEL, BELIEVE YOU, WE KNOW, BUT WE LITERALLY HAVE ONLY ONE SHOT ON THIS. WE MIGHT AS WELL TAKE A WATER PISTOL TO THE SUN. YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT'S GONNA WORK? REMARKABLY SIMILAR TO THE ONE THAT WIPED OUT THE DINOSAURS, AND WE'RE TRYING TO STOP IT WITH AN OVERSIZE MICROWAVE OVEN? NO, I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA WORK. NOW, LISTEN TO ME NOW, "MR. HANSON," IS IT? - HINTZE. - HINTZE. YEAH, WELL, I WOULD NEVER ENTRUST NATIONAL SECURITY TO A MICROWAVE OVEN. SolStar-2 RESPONDING, ADJUSTING, TARGETING. EMERGENCY BIRTH IN 30 SECONDS. GENTLEMEN, WE MAY BE ABOUT TO SAVE THE WORLD TODAY. - COLONEL, DO YOU PRAY? -20 SECONDS. - NOT LATELY. - YOU MIGHT WANT TO START AGAIN. - THIS IS CRAZY. - SHUT UP, HINTZE! THERE ARE THINGS YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. SIX, FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE, ZERO. WE'LL FLY OUT OF HERE IN A COUPLE HOURS. LET'S GET GOING. - WHERE? THEY THINK THE COMET'S GONNA HIT SOMEWHERE IN NORTHERN RUSSIA, SO SOUTH, I GUESS. OKAY, WELL, THEN I GOT TO PACK. - NO, NO, NO, NO. NO LUGGAGE... THERE'S NO ROOM, OKAY? THIS IS AN EMERGENCY BROADCAST. SCIENTISTS HAVE CONFIRMED THAT THE COMET WILL IMPACT EARTH SOMEWHERE IN NORTHERN EUROPE WITHIN HOURS. CITIZENS HAVE BEEN ADVISED TO EVACUATE... WE'RE GOING ON A LITTLE TRIP, SWEETHEART. IN LAST-DITCH ATTEMPT TO DESTROY THE COMET, A TOP-SECRET MICROWAVE-BEAM WEAPON HAS APPARENTLY BEEN USED. IT APPEARS THE WEAPON HAS FAILED. AT THIS BASE, ALONE, NO LESS THAN 50 C-17 AND C-130 AIRCRAFT HAVE BEEN SENT TO CITIES LIKE COPENHAGEN, OSLO, AND BERLIN TO EVACUATE AMERICAN PERSONNEL. FROM RAMSTEIN AIR FORCE BASE, THIS IS JOHN ELKIN REPORTING. PRELIMINARY ESTIMATES SPEAK OF OVER 4 BILLION DEAD AND MOST OF NORTHERN EURASIA BECOMING UNINHABITABLE, POSSIBLY FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS. - YOU CAN'T SEE THE SUN ANYMORE. THE SKY IS PITCH BLACK IN PRAGUE AT 2:00 P.M. ANNA VOLKOVA FOR CTN BULGARIA. MAJOR INCIDENTS OF LOOTING WERE REPORTED IN WARSAW, BERLIN, DRESDEN, AND KIEV ONLY MINUTES AFTER THE IMPACT. - COMMUNICATION IN EUROPE IS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY LIMITED TO SATELLITE CELLPHONES NOW, AND THEY'RE BECOMING INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO GET BATTERY POWER. - ...HAVE RELOCATED TO TANGIER. U.N. OFFICIALS HAVE STATED THAT THEY EXPECT A NEW GOVERNING BODY OF WHAT ONCE WAS EUROPE TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED WITHIN DAYS NOW. TEMPERATURES HAVE DROPPED BELOW ZERO WITHIN HOURS, AND THE BLACK SNOW RESUMES IN NUCLEAR FALLOUT. THE CLOUD OVER CENTRAL EUROPE IS DEFLECTING 85% OF THE SUNLIGHT. - ..ICE AGE. ACCORDING TO SCIENTISTS, EARTH FACES AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE AND A VERY LONG WINTER. COME ON, GET UP. NOW, THIS AREA IS FOR DIPLOMATS ONLY, OKAY? YOU GUYS STAY HERE. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. - WH-WHY CAN'T WE COME WITH YOU? I GOT TO TAKE CARE OF THIS SITUATION FIRST. I'LL COME RIGHT BACK. I PROMISE, OKAY? HE'LL BE RIGHT BACK, SWEETIE. IT'S OKAY. YEAH, IT'S ALL RIGHT. - I need clearance now. Can you hear me? I need clearance. - NO! NO. FORGET CLEARANCE! WE'VE GOT TO GET THIS PLANE MOVING RIGHT NOW. - I CAN'T LEAVE. MY FATHER'S STILL HERE, AND HE NEEDS ME. MS. STARNDORF, YOUR FATHER MADE HIS DECISION. HE WANTS TO STAY. HE MADE IT EQUALLY CLEAR HE WANTS YOU OUT. - BUT YOU CAN'T LET ME GO! - YES, I CAN. - MS. STARNDORF! MS. STARNDORF! I'M SURE YOUR FATHER'S GONNA CATCH A PLANE IN A DAY OR TWO WHEN HE SEES THAT EVERYTHING'S ALL RIGHT. I HAVE A DAUGHTER, MYSELF. I'M SURE HE JUST WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE SAFE. NOW, PLEASE... PLEASE GET ON THE PLANE. - GOOD WORK, PARKER. WHY DON'T YOU COME UP AND HELP ME CALM THE OTHERS. - SIR... - NOW, PARKER! THAT'S AN ORDER. - EVERYBODY, SIT DOWN, FIND A COMFORTABLE PLACE TO SIT DOWN, HOLD ON. Flight 210, you're clear for immediate takeoff. Clear out of here as quick as you can. We have major storms moving in. - OKAY, CLOSE IT UP. - PULL IT BACK! - COLONEL, I NEED TO GET OFF THIS PLANE! - IT'S TOO LATE. - N-NO, SIR, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND... - YOU ARE TOO LATE. SIR, MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER ARE OUT THERE. - THEY CAN GET ON THE NEXT PLANE. NOW YOU SIT DOWN, AND THAT'S AN ORDER. - OKAY, PARKER! NOW, YOU'RE COMING ON THIS PLANE EITHER AS A PASSENGER OR A CORPSE. IT'S YOUR CHOICE. I'M GETTING OFF THIS PLANE RIGHT NOW, COLONEL. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER YOURSELF REALLY SPECIAL, PARKER. YOU'RE THE ONLY MAN WHO EVER PULLED A GUN ON ME AND LIVED. - UNH! - WHAT THE HELL?s LOOKS LIKE ONE OF OUR OFFERS JUST LET UP. THE SolStar-2 HAS JUST SWITCHED FROM RED TO GREEN, I NEED YOU TO CHECK IT OUT. WHY? BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE CODES. IT CAN ONLY BE ACCESSED FROM ITS ORIGINAL CONTROL CENTER IN BERLIN. LOOK, EITHER SOMEBODY'S ALIVE OUT THERE OR SOME GENIUS JUST RIPPED THE CODE. - SANDWICH? - THANKS. - I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. I BARELY MADE IT OUT OF THERE THREE YEARS AGO, AND NOW THEY'RE SENDING US BACK IN. FOR WHAT? LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY FORGOT TO TURN THE LIGHTS OUT AT THE NLI INSTITUTE IN BERLIN. - YOU'RE KIDDING ME. THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT? - YEP. - DRAG. I WAS IN BERLIN FOR TWO YEARS... WILD TOWN IN ITS DAY. - HEY, YOU FEEL THAT? - THE PLANE'S GETTING WARMER. - JESUS. SOMEBODY TELL THE PILOT TO CUT THE HEAT. I'M GONNA SEE WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON. - RIGHT. CAPTAIN, WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON IN HERE? WE'RE ON FIRE BACK HERE. THAT DOESN'T LOOK SO GOOD NOW, DOES IT? WANT TO CHECK IT OUT? MADAME PRESIDENT, IT WAS A MICROWAVE BEAM FROM SolStar-2. BASICALLY, THEY WERE FLASH-FRIED. AT LEAST WE KNOW THAT SolStar-2 IS ACTIVE AND UNDER CONTROL... ALBEIT HOSTILE CONTROL. WE LOST 18 MEN TO FIND THAT OUT. I THOUGHT IT WAS ACCESSIBLE ONLY FROM THE COMMAND CENTER IN BERLIN. THAT'S RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DEATH ZONE. AND ACCORDING TO OUR LATEST INTELLIGENCE FROM THE DEATH ZONE, WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY CONTACT THERE FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS. I'D SAY WE HAVE AN INTELLIGENCE FAILURE THEN. COLONEL, SolStar's MICROWAVE BEAM PRESENTS A THREAT TO ALL OUR AIRCRAFT. - THERE'S MORE TO IT THAN THAT. - WHAT DO YOU MEAN? THE MICROWAVE BEAM WAS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED TO BE TRANSMITTED TO GROUND-RELAY STATIONS AT A LOW LEVEL OF ENERGY. - AND? - AT A HIGHER LEVEL, IT CAN BE DISCHARGED FROM A SINGLE, CONCENTRATED BURST. - RESULTING IN...? - MASSIVE WIDE-SCALE DESTRUCTION. SolStar-2 WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AN EXPERIMENTAL POWER STATION THAT WOULD GIVE HUMANITY AN UNLIMITED SUPPLY THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY END OUR DEPENDANCE ON FOSSIL FUELS. THE MILITARY FUNDED ITS DEVELOPMENT. WE NEEDED IT TO HAVE SOME SORT OF WEAPON CAPACITY. A WEAPON? EVEN YOUR BLACK OPS HAVE BLACK OPS. ANYTHING ELSE I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT? - SolStar-2 WAS CONSIDERED LOST. WE ASSUMED IT HAD BEEN DAMAGED OR DESTROYED WHEN THE COMET ENTERED THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE. WE SAW NO NEED TO PUT A DEAD PROJECT IN THE REPORT. WELL, SOMEBODY OUT THERE IS USING IT AGAINST US. ARE THERE ANY EXPERTS WHO CAN HELP US? GREGOR STARNDORF DESIGNED THE SATELLITE. HOWEVER, HE AND HIS PROJECT SUPERVISOR, HINTZE, REMAINED IN BERLIN WHEN IT WAS EVACUATED. BUT HIS DAUGHTER, ANNA, WHO ALSO WORKED ON THE PROJECT, DID GET OUT. - WHERE IS SHE NOW? - QUITO, ECUADOR, SOUTH AMERICA. - I WANT HER BACK. - YES, MA'AM. NO, NO. SI, SENORA. - YEP. YES, HELLO? TODAY? NO, OUT OF THE QUESTION. I JUST... IT WHAT? I'M ON MY WAY TO THE AIRPORT. YEAH, BYE. - HEY-HEY-HEY, HEY, HEY. - IT'S OKAY, OKAY? - LEAVE HER ALONE. THANK YOU. - ANNA STARNDORF? - DO I KNOW YOU? YEAH, UH, TOM PARKER... USED TO BE "CAPTAIN TOM PARKER." I'M NO LONGER IN THE MILITARY. I MET YOU AT THE U.S. EMBASSY IN BERLIN WITH YOUR FATHER. - OH, YEAH, YEAH. SORRY, YOU LOOK SO DIFFERENT. YEAH. SEEMS WE ONLY RUN INTO EACH OTHER WHEN THERE'S TROUBLE. AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TROUBLE THE LAST THREE YEARS. IT HASN'T BEEN THAT DIFFICULT. - AND THIS IS YOUR FRIEND? THIS... THIS IS SASQUATCH, MY TRAVELING COMPANION. - OH, REALLY? WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN TRAVELING? NORTH... ACTUALLY, I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET BACK TO BERLIN. - BUT THEY SAID THAT NO ONE... - WELL, NO ONE HAS. THERE HASN'T EVEN BEEN A RESCUE MISSION IN THE LAST THREE YEARS. I'VE BEEN TRYING ALONE. I KNOW THAT PROBABLY SOUNDS CRAZY, BUT... NO-NO, NO-NO, NO, IT SOUNDS WONDERFUL. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES I'VE FANTASIZED ABOUT PACKING A BAG AND HEADING OUT, YOU KNOW? UNFORTUNATELY, I'VE BEEN LIVING IN ECUADOR, SO A JOURNEY TO BERLIN IS A LITTLE BIT OUT OF MY WAY. - ECUADOR? - YEAH. I'M HELPING TO FEED REFUGEES THERE. SO, AFTER BERLIN, MY SPACE RESEARCH SEEMED TO... SPACE RESEARCH... THAT'S RIGHT. YOUR FATHER DEVELOPED SolStar-2. - YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. SO, YOU'RE HERE ABOUT THE PLANE CRASH. - HOW DID YOU KNOW? IS THERE SOMEPLACE THAT WE CAN SPEAK IN PRIVATE? - YEAH, COME WITH ME. - MS. STARNDORF, NORMALLY, WHEN YOU'RE CALLED BEFORE THE PRESIDENT, THE SUMMONS IS FOR YOU ALONE... NOT YOU AND A GUEST. - MY APOLOGIES. THIS IS TOM PARKER. HE USED TO WORK AT THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN BERLIN. - AND HE'S HERE BECAUSE...? TWO DAYS AGO, UP NORTH, ONE OF YOUR MILITARY JETS CRASHED. I SAW IT GO DOWN. - A TRAGIC ACCIDENT. - IT WAS NO ACCIDENT, MA'AM. YOU CAME TO THIS CONCLUSION BY YOURSELF? - NO, MA'AM. I RECOVERED THE BLACK BOX. THIS DAMAGE OCCURRED BEFORE THE PLANE BLEW UP. THE ONLY WEAPON THAT I KNOW THAT COULD CAUSE THIS KIND OF DAMAGE IS A MICROWAVE-BEAM WEAPON... SolStar-2. WHY DON'T I HAVE PEOPLE LIKE YOU ON MY STAFF? I'D LIKE TO BE INCLUDED ON THE EXPEDITION, MA'AM. - WHAT EXPEDITION? THE ONE THAT YOU'RE GONNA SEND TO BERLIN TO INVESTIGATE. - THAT'S OUT OF THE QUESTION. COLONEL WATERS, I'M THE MOST EXPERIENCED PERSON... LOOK, WHY DON'T I JUST HAVE YOU ARRESTED AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN'T GO? WHY DON'T YOU STICK A GUN IN MY FACE LIKE YOU DID LAST TIME? - THAT CAN BE ARRANGED, PARKER. EASE UP ON THE TESTOSTERONE, GENTLEMEN. WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO BERLIN, MR. PARKER? - PERSONAL REASONS, MA'AM. - HE'S RIGHT. HE HAS ALREADY TRIED TO GET THERE EIGHT TIMES. HIS EXPERIENCE COULD PROVE INVALUABLE. CONSIDER YOURSELF DRAFTED, MR. PARKER, BY THE N.U.N.S. GOVERNMENT. IF YOU FORMALLY WORKED FOR THE EMBASSY, I DON'T HAVE TO REMIND YOU ABOUT SECURITY? - NO, MA'AM. - THANK YOU, MR. PARKER. I DON'T KNOW HOW WELL YOU KNOW COLONEL WATERS, BUT HE'LL BE HEADING THIS MISSION. YOU'LL BE TAKING YOUR ORDERS FROM HIM, IS THAT CLEAR? - YES, MA'AM. WELL, I HOPE YOU'RE BETTER BEHAVED THAN YOUR DOG, MR. PARKER. YES, MA'AM. YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO THAT I DON'T WANT YOU ON THIS TRIP, BUT I HAVE MY ORDERS JUST LIKE LAST TIME. - AIN'T MUCH. - WHAT? A HANDFUL OF SOLDIERS, A COUPLE TRUCKS... I'D EXPECT A BIGGER CONVOY FOR WHAT'S AT STAKE. WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST. THE UNITED STATES HAVE US BY THE BALLS. WE NEED THEIR ALL MORE THAN EVER NOW. THIS IS SARAH HENLEY. SHE'S EX-S.A.S. WITH THE BRITS. SHE'S BEEN SELECTED AS MY SECOND IN COMMAND, AND THAT MEANS THAT YOU WILL FOLLOW HER INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY THE SAME AS YOU WOULD FOLLOW MINE. YOU UNDERSTAND? EXACTLY THE SAME WAY I'D FOLLOW YOURS. - HM. - SURE. SURE. - IT'S NOT ALL CHEER. I CAN HANDLE THAT. - I BET YOU CAN. - CATCH YOU LATER. IT MAKES YOU WONDER, DOESN'T IT? WE ONLY GET THAT ON NATIONAL HOLIDAYS AND BEFORE A DANGEROUS MISSION. DOESN'T IT MAKE YOU WANT TO TAKE EVERYTHING YOU CAN GET BEFORE YOU LEAVE? I GUESS THAT WOULD DEPEND ON WHAT I COULD GET. THAT WAS GOOD. - LADIES, GENTLEMEN... PRESIDENT. MADAME PRESIDENT, WE'RE SET TO GO. 4 MILLION, WATERS... REMEMBER THAT NUMBER. - EXCUSE ME? Space research lab's registered a shift in SolStar's position. According to their calculations, It's targeting pretty much the ground we're standing on. If their estimates are right, it'll be ready to fire in 48 hours. IF IT DOES, FOUR AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE COULD DIE. GOD SPEED TO YOU ALL. OKAY, PEOPLE, WE HAVE A DEADLINE... 48 HOURS. LET'S MOVE. EVERYBODY IN THE TRUCKS. PREPARE TO DROP. - THANKS FOR TH... WHOA. - TOM? TOM, IT'S TIME TO... OH. WE'RE FLYING SO LOW. - ANY LOWER, WE'D BE DRIVING. MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ONCE LIVED HERE. NOW IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN LIKE THIS. IF THINGS STAY THE SAME FOR A WHILE, LIFE TRICKS US INTO BELIEVING THAT THEY ALWAYS WILL BE. - TOM, CAN I TRUST YOU? - WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YOU'RE DOING THIS FOR A PERSONAL REASON, SO AM I. THEY THINK THAT MY DAD IS ALIVE AND HE'S IN CONTROL OF THE SATELLITE. - WELL, WHAT IF HE IS? - MY FATHER DIED IN BERLIN. WELL, WHAT IF, FOR WHATEVER REASON, HE DIDN'T DIE AND HE IS IN CONTROL OF THE SATELLITE? - I DON'T KNOW. - THEN I CAN'T MAKE ANY PROMISES. - WHEN HE WAS LITTLE, HIS PARENTS STAYED IN BERLIN DURING WORLD WAR II. IT WAS ONCE SUCH A VIBRANT, EXCITING CITY, BUT THE WAR DESTROYED IT. WHEN IT WAS OVER, THEY STAYED, REBUILT, AND TURNED THE PILE OF RUBBLE INTO A CITY AGAIN, EVEN BETTER THAN BEFORE. HE ALWAYS SAID, "BERLIN IS LIKE A WIFE. YOU STICK WITH HER IN GOOD TIMES AND IN BAD." SO, HE AND HIS ASSISTANTS STAYED BEHIND. - BRAVE GUYS? NOT BRAVE... STUPID. THEY SAY BRAVERY AND STUPIDITY ARE CLOSE FRIENDS. ONLY THE RESULT SEPARATES THE TWO. AND NOW YOU CAN SEE WHY I KNOW MY FATHER'S INNOCENT. HE'S SEEN TOO MUCH DESTRUCTION IN HIS LIFE TO CAUSE ANY, HIMSELF. HEY, LOOK. HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO PARIS? - MY HONEYMOON. - SEE YOU ON THE GROUND. TRUCK TWO, DO YOU READ ME? - This is truck two. We're good. OKAY, SYSTEM CHECKED, EVERYTHING IN THE GREEN. WHEN THE SATELLITE STARTS TURNING, THEN WE DROP. YOU WANT TO WAIT UNTIL SolStar-2 IS READY TO FIRE ON US? - THE PLANE'S EXPENDABLE. - BUT WE ARE NOT EXPENDABLE. IT'S A NECESSARY RISK IF WE'RE GONNA CONVINCE WHOEVER'S IN CONTROL OF THAT SATELLITE THAT THEY'VE DESTROYED US. - YOU DON'T LIKE WATERS. - DO I HAVE TO? - WHAT ABOUT THE STARNDORF GIRL? - WHAT ABOUT HER? - YOU SEEM TO KNOW HER. - FROM ANOTHER LIFE, YEAH. PEOPLE ALWAYS USE THAT EXPRESSION, "FROM ANOTHER LIFE," WHEN REFERRING TO BEFORE THE IMPACT. I THINK IT'S BULLOCKS. IT'S THE SAME LIFE. I WAS A SOLDIER BEFORE... I'M A SOLDIER NOW. A COMET CAN'T CHANGE THAT. - I GUESS NOT. - THE SATELLITE IS TURNING. - HOW LONG? -20 SECONDS. - OKAY, EVERYONE, STRAP IN. IT'S GOT A LOCK ON US. WE NEED TO DROP. - NOT YET. - IT'S POWERING UP. EVERY SECOND WE SPEND UP HERE IS AN HOUR LESS ON THE GROUND. ON MY MARK... MICROWAVE BEAM... WE'RE HIT. COLONEL WATERS, WE NEED TO GET OUT OF THIS PLANE RIGHT NOW. THE LAST PLANE TOOK 40 SECONDS BEFORE IT BLEW. - THIS IS INSANE. - NO, NO, NO. IT'S A RISK. SOMETIMES, IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE OUR GOALS, WE HAVE TO TAKE RISKS THAT OTHER PEOPLE MIGHT SEE AS INSANE. DO YOU KNOW WHO SAID THAT? - MY FATHER. - THAT'S RIGHT. INITIATE DROP. SHOOT DEPLOYMENT IN FIVE SECONDS. FOUR... THREE...TWO... ONE. SHOOT DEPLOYED. OKAY, EVERYONE, HOLD TIGHT. IT'S GONNA BE A ROUGH LANDING. - GREAT. WELL, CERTAINLY BEATS TRYING TO GET TO BERLIN ON SNOWSHOES. - DON'T KNOCK IT TILL YOU TRY IT. - HM, 'CAUSE YOU HAVE. - TRIED EIGHT TIMES. I GET EVERYTHING I WANT THE FIRST TIME I TRY. I WOULD NEVER TRY ANYTHING EIGHT TIMES. WHAT KEEPS YOU GOING? A PROMISE. WHY DO YOU KEEP GOING? MY ORDERS... THAT'S KIND OF A PROMISE, TOO. HERE WE GO. - IS EVERYBODY OKAY? - THAT WASN'T SO BAD. - EXACTLY WHERE ARE WE? NEAR THE FORMER FRENCH-BELGIUM BORDER. OUTSIDE TEMPERATURE'S NEGATIVE... 52T CELSIUS. - OKAY, LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. TRUCK TWO, WE TAKE THE LEAD. - THIS IS TRUCK TWO. ROGER THAT, TRUCK ONE. AH, THIS DAMN TWILIGHT. I CAN'T SEE A THING. YOU'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE. DOES IT GET ANY BETTER? - NOPE. GONNA BE DIFFICULT TO DO THE WEATHER FORECAST OUT HERE. YEAH, EVERY DAY'S CLOUDY AND COLD... THAT'S IT. - YOU SEE? THE WEATHER'S STABLE, BUT THE GROUND ISN'T. THAT COMET CAUSED SOME SORT OF PROBLEM WITH THE MAGMA FLOW. PEOPLE THINK THAT EUROPE'S GONNA BREAK APART. AS LONG AS IT HOLDS UP LONG ENOUGH FOR US TO GET OUR ASSES OUT OF HERE, I DON'T CARE. WHAT WAS THAT? - ICE GEYSER. THERE'S A LOT OF PRESSURE UNDERNEATH THE ICE. - YEAH, YOU'RE TELLING ME. WHY DON'T YOU AND PARKER GET SOME REST. Let Scott drive. - YOU WANT TO GET SOME REST? SORRY, SOMEBODY DOESN'T THINK THAT'S A VERY GOOD IDEA. WHAT THE HELL DO YOU MEAN "DETOUR"? According to David Crockett, here, we've got to be very careful crossing the river. - THE GROUND'S FROZEN SOLID. IT'LL EASILY TAKE THE WEIGHT OF TWO TRUCKS. THE GROUND OVER THE RIVER IS EXTREMELY JAGGED AND COMPLETELY UNSTABLE. The bridges are intact. I say we use one of those. FOR GOD'S SAKE, PARKER, YOU KNOW TIME'S OF THE ESSENCE. OKAY. OKAY. WHICH ONE'S THE NEAREST? WEILER, COLOGNE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF BRIDGES IN THIS CITY. - PICK ONE. - TARGET THE COLOGNE CATHEDRAL. The Deutzer Bridge should be right next to it. WE HAVE THE CATHEDRAL ON OUR SCANNERS. IT'S ONLY FEW MILES OUT OF OUR WAY. COLOGNE... I WENT THERE WHEN I WAS A KID... GREAT CARNIVAL. YEAH, WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE WE MISSED THAT CARNIVAL OF YOURS. Okay. LET'S DO THIS. THE SOONER I GET OVER THERE, THE HAPPIER I'M GONNA BE. TRUCK TWO, YOU TAKE THE LEAD. - ROGER THAT, COLONEL. TAKE THIS SLOW AND CAREFUL. WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WE'RE GONNA COME UP AGAINST, ALL RIGHT? IT LOOKS LIKE LEVEL ICE UP AHEAD. PICK UP THE SPEED, PARKER. - NO-NO, NO-NO, NO-NO. - Come on, Parker! Faster! - I WOULDN'T ADVISE THAT, SIR. WELL, YOUR ADVICE HAS BEEN NOTED AND IS DULY BEING IGNORED. GIVE ME SOME MORE SPEED, MALONEY. THAT IDIOT'S GONNA GET US KILLED. OKAY, GIVE HIM SOME SPACE. SHIT. COLONEL, ARE YOU OKAY? IS EVERYBODY OKAY IN THERE? - BRACE YOURSELVES! WHEN THIS THING GOES, IT'S GONNA BE A BUMPY RIDE! PARKER! ARE YOU TRYING TO GET YOURSELF KILLED?! NO, SIR, JUST TRYING TO SAVE YOUR LIFE. HERE CATCH THE ROPE. - LADIES FIRST, MS. STARNDORF. - I CAN'T. I FALL. I GOT HER, COLONEL. YOU GUYS GO AHEAD. - OKAY. - BETTER HOLD ONTO ME. I GOT YOU, I GOT YOU. HOLD ONTO ME. HOLD ONTO ME! JUST SLOWING YOU DOWN. IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY. I GOT YOU. SEE? TOLD YOU. ALL RIGHT. I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT, BUT WE'RE ALL ABOUT TO BE KILLED! SO GIVE HER A HAND, HENLEY! HELP ME OUT! OKAY, ANNA, WE... HERE WE GO. - GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE! - WHERE IS PARKER? - I DIDN'T SEE HIM GET OFF. AAAAH! LET'S GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE! - BLOODY HELL, WHAT NOW? - WHAT IS IT? WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE WE BROKE THE FRONT AXLE ON THE LAST RUN. - DO WE NEED TO FIX IT? - YEAH, WE DO. UNLESS WE WANT TO TRAVEL TO BERLIN ON A TURBO SLED. IT SHOULD ONLY TAKE ABOUT AN HOUR. TOBIN, SCOTT, CAN YOU GET ON IT? - COME ON, GUYS. GET A MOVE ON. PARKER, THAT WAS A CRAZY STUNT YOU PULLED BACK THERE. THANKS. - YEAH, SURE. UH, I'M GONNA GO OUTSIDE AND GET SOME FRESH AIR. - CAN I COME WITH YOU? - YEAH, SURE. - I WANTED TO THANK YOU, TOO. NO, I'M HAPPY TO HAVE THE COMPANY. - NO...FOR SAVING MY LIFE. THAT WAS VERY BRAVE. - BRAVE OR STUPID? I GUESS I'M NOT GOOD UNDER STRESS. WELL, YOU GET BETTER WITH PRACTICE. SOMETHING TELLS ME THIS TRIP... WE'RE GONNA GET PLENTY OF PRACTICE. WHAT'S THAT? IT'S PRETTY CLEVER... DOESN'T NEED ANY BATTERIES, WON'T EVER FREEZE, KEEPS MAKING NOISE NIGHT AND DAY. DO YOU THINK THERE IS SOMEONE IN THERE? NO, NO, BUT MAYBE THERE'S SOME CLUES AS TO WHEN THEY LEFT. LET'S CHECK IT OUT. THESE PEOPLE TRIED TO FIGHT THE COLD. - THEY DIDN'T LEAVE. HOPEFULLY, THEY DIDN'T SUFFER TOO MUCH. I HEAR IT DOESN'T EVEN HURT. DO YOU THINK THEY... YOUR WIFE AND DAUGHTER... ARE STILL WAITING FOR YOU? I HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE. WE BETTER GET GOING. - HOW'S IT LOOK? THE CITY IS BURIED UNDER 20 METERS OF ICE AND SNOW. - ANY SIGN OF LIFE? - NONE SO FAR. I'LL PLOT A COURSE FOR THE INSTITUTE. NO. NO, DESPITE WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR FATHER, THERE MAY BE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE WILLING TO DO US HARM. WE'LL RECON FROM HERE. - I CAN CHECK IT OUT ON THE SLED. - YOU WOULDN'T COME BACK. - AND WHY IS THAT? BECAUSE ALL YOU WANTED WAS TO GET TO BERLIN. HOW CAN I TRUST YOU TO COME BACK? YOU KNOW, THE SLED DOES ACTUALLY HAVE TWO SEATS. I COULD GO WITH HIM. I MEAN, HE DOES KNOW THE CITY. - BE MY GUEST. - FINE. - OKAY, SECURE THE PERIMETER. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? - I WANT TO HAVE A LOOK AROUND. IT'S MY HOME TOWN, REMEMBER? - UH, NO, NO, NO. IT'S A WAR ZONE NOW, AND I CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE YOU. YOUR JOB STARTS ONCE WE SECURE THE INSTITUTE. HEY, HEY, TAKE IT EASY, COLONEL. - DON'T TELL ME TO TAKE IT EASY! NOTHING'S GONNA JEOPARDIZE THIS MISSION, YOU UNDERSTAND? SAS, SAS. STAY WITH THE NICE LADY. KEEP HER COMPANY TILL I GET BACK. OH, DON'T WORRY. HE DOESN'T BITE...USUALLY. DO YOU MIND PUTTING THE GUN AWAY, PLEASE? LET'S JUST CALL IT MY INSURANCE POLICY. - OKAY. - WHAT, YOU LIVED HERE FOR YEARS? YEAH, WELL, I DID MOST OF MY DRIVING AROUND AND WALKING AROUND ON STREET LEVEL. I DON'T RECOGNIZE THAT HILL. LET'S GO CHECK IT OUT. - DO YOU HAVE TO DO THAT? - HEY, I JUST SAVED OUR LIVES. LEAST YOU COULD DO IS BE POLITE. - OH, MY GOD. ARE THOSE LIGHTS OVER THERE? - OH, NO, NO, NO. THEY USE A LOT OF MIRRORS INSIDE SO THAT THE SUN WAS SHINING ON PARLIAMENT. YEAH, ALL RIGHT, PROFESSOR... FASCINATING HISTORY LESSON. I THINK WE SHOULD GET GOING. IT'S GONNA GET DARK SOON. - I DON'T SEE ANYBODY. GET INSIDE! HENLEY, LET'S GO! - JESUS. THEY'RE UNDER ATTACK. THEY'RE SITTING DUCKS RIGHT THERE. WHY DON'T THEY MOVE? OH, MY GOD. - Parker, get out of there! - COLONEL WATERS, YOU'RE ALIVE? We're about 200 meters ahead behind the building. They've seen us. Get out of the sled! - WHAT HAPPENED?! WE CAME OUT, THEY SAW US, SO WE EVAC-ED THE TRUCK. - ANY CASUALTIES? RICH DIDN'T MAKE IT. WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? SAME AS YOU... WE CAME UNDER FIRE. WELL, THIS EXPEDITION'S TURNED INTO A MILITARY CONFLICT. WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE! LET'S GO! - OKAY, GO-O-O-O! - TOM, LOOK! - WHAT IS IT? - I DON'T KNOW... RIGHT THERE. - IT'S A TUNNEL! - WELL, LET'S GO DIG THAT. ELLISON, TAKE POINT! - SAS, COME HERE, BOY. COME HERE. - IT'S A LOT WARMER DOWN HERE. WHAT'S THAT? - IT'S STILL WARM. WHAT IS IT, SAS? WHAT IS IT, BOY, HUH? GO! MY GOD, IT'S A LITTLE GIRL. - THIS LITTLE, POOR THING. SHE'S SCARED. HEY. HEY, IT'S OKAY, SWEETIE. HEY, DON'T WORRY. WE'RE NOT GONNA HURT YOU. LOOK, EVEN MY DOG, SASQUATCH, LIKES YOU, SEE? LOOKS LIKE YOU MAKE FRIENDS FAST. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? - SAS, GO. - DON'T YOU HAVE A NAME? - MAYBE SHE CAN'T SPEAK. CAN WE SPEED UP WITH YOUR TOUCHY-FEELY STUFF. TAKING THE INSTITUTE'S OUR PRIORITY, AND, IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED, WE JUST LOST OUR RIDE HOME. - LET'S NOT RUSH INTO THINGS. ANYBODY WHO SURVIVED HERE FOR THREE YEARS KNOWS MORE ABOUT THE CITY THAN WE DO AND PROBABLY ABOUT OUR ATTACKERS. AND WHAT IF THEY ARE THE ATTACKERS? SIR, I THINK OUR PRIORITY'S A... I'M PERFECTLY WELL AWARE OF OUR PRIORITIES, HENLEY... AND ALSO OF THE CHAIN OF COMMAND. DO YOU KNOW WHERE THE OTHER PEOPLE ARE? HEY, DON'T WORRY. WE WON'T HURT YOU, BUT WE NEED YOUR HELP. HENLEY, GIVE ME ONE OF YOUR ENERGY BARS. WHAT AM I? THE SALVATION ARMY? - JUST DO IT. - YOU HUNGRY? HERE. YEAH. LISTEN, WE REALLY NEED TO SPEAK TO THE OTHER PEOPLE. CAN YOU TAKE US TO THEM? OKAY, GREAT. ALL THIS TIME, WE THOUGHT NOBODY SURVIVED. - IT'S AMAZING. - WHERE DO YOU FIGURE WE ARE? UNLESS I'M COMPLETELY OFF, THIS IS THE U2-LINE SERVICE STATION. - EXCUSE US. WE HAVEN'T SEEN STRANGERS HERE SINCE... WELL, IT'S BEEN YEARS. WE WERE SENT HERE BY THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PROVISIONAL NORTHERN STATES. - FOR US? - NO. - EXCUSE ME. HAVE YOU... SEEN...THESE...PEOPLE? NO? - NO, WE'RE HERE ON A MISSION. WE HAD NO IDEA THAT THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE HERE. DID YOU TRY TO LEAVE? - THINGS GOT VERY BAD VERY FAST. NO PLACES WERE LEFT... THE STREETS WERE BLOCKED. THE GROUND FROZE, SO WE COULDN'T EVEN BURY THE DEAD. EVENTUALLY, A LOT OF US WENT UNDERGROUND. - WHO'S YOUR LEADER? - LEADER? WELL, SOMEONE MUST BE ORGANIZING ALL THIS. WELL, HE'S NOT SO MUCH OF A LEADER, BUT THE DOCTOR HAS HELPED US TO GET THINGS ORGANIZED. - CAN WE TALK TO HIM? - HE'S NOT HERE RIGHT NOW. HE KEEPS TO HIMSELF. HE'S NOT VERY WELL ON HIS FEET THESE DAYS. HE USUALLY IS IN THE REICHTAG. - AND HOW DO WE GET THERE? OH, GO DOWN THE OTHER TUNNEL ABOUT 500 METERS. YOU'LL SEE A BREAK... YOU SEE, WE BROKE THROUGH A WALL TO GET A DIRECT ACCESS TO IT. - THANK YOU. - TOM? TOM, ARE YOU COMING? IS THIS LITTLE GIRL PART OF YOUR GROUP? HER PARENTS WERE KILLED IN AN ACCIDENT A FEW YEARS BACK. WE OFFERED HER A PLACE TO LIVE, BUT SHE LIKES TO COME AND GO. - SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK? - SOMETHING DOESN'T ADD UP. I DON'T LIKE IT WHEN THINGS DON'T ADD UP. HEY, LOOK, I THINK WE CAN SAFELY SAY THAT THESE PEOPLE DIDN'T ATTACK US. HAD ANYONE SEEN YOUR FAMILY? - NO. - TOBIN, SECURE THE POSITION. SOMEBODY'S GOT A REAL GREEN THUMB. - YEAH, I GUESS I DID SEE LIGHTS. LET'S SPREAD OUT AND FIND THIS DOCTOR. ELLISON, SECURE THIS POSITION. - SAS, WAIT. FINSCHEN, WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO, MY LITTLE GIRL? - DADDY? - ANNA. - DADDY. - DADDY. - ANNA. - DADDY? DADDY, WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU? WHEN I DECIDED TO STAY, I KNEW THERE'D BE A PRICE TO PAY. I COULDN'T LEAVE ALL THE PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T MAKE IT IN TIME. WILL YOU FORGIVE ME? OH, DADDY, I FORGAVE YOU A LONG TIME AGO. YOU DID WHAT YOU THOUGHT WAS RIGHT. - SO, I GUESS YOU'RE THE DOCTOR. - OH, REALLY? THAT'S...WHAT PEOPLE CALL ME BECAUSE I HELP THEM TO GET BY. - DAD, THIS IS TOM PARKER. REMEMBER HIM? HE WAS THE HEAD OF SECURITY AT THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN BERLIN... THE NIGHT WE DISCOVERED BAY-LEDER 7 HAD CHANGED COURSE... - I'VE FORGOTTEN SO MANY THINGS. WELL, MR. PARKER, IT SEEMS LIKE YOU COULDN'T STAY AWAY, EITHER. - YES, SIR. - CUCURBITA LAGENARIA. THE ORDINARY CUCUMBER. - DAD, WHO BUILT THIS? - WE ALL PULLED TOGETHER... PLENTY OF TIME, AS YOU CAN IMAGINE. - SO, YOU GROW ALL THE FOOD HERE? - ONLY A LITTLE. THREE YEARS AGO, STARVATION WAS AS MUCH AS A KILLER AS THE COLD. THE COLD FINALLY WON. SO MANY DIED THAT THOSE WHO SURVIVED COULD EASILY LIVE FROM THE FOOD THEY FOUND FROZEN IN THE STORE THROUGHOUT THE CITY. - SO, THEN WHY BUILD ALL THIS? PEOPLE SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN FEEL THE LIGHT, MR. PARKER. HE WILL BE TRYING TO SELL US A TIMESHARE NEXT. - WHO IS THIS? WE CAME HERE WITH COLONEL WATERS AND A FEW SOLDIERS. WHY HAVE YOU BROUGHT IN SOLDIERS? - IT'S SECURITY MEASURE, MR. STARNDORF. - SECURITY MEASURE? THE ONLY PEOPLE STILL CARRYING GUNS ARE THE DISTRIBUTORS... MY SECURITY FORCE. AND WHY EXACTLY DO YOU NEED A SECURITY FORCE? AFTER THE STORMS, PEOPLE CAME IN FROM THE NORTH. WHEN THEY THREATENED OUR EXISTENCE, WE... SO DISTRIBUTORS WERE FORMED TO PROTECT YOU FROM LOOTERS. - WE HELPED AS MANY AS WE COULD. AND WHAT EXACTLY ARE THEY DOING NOW? AS THE WORD IMPLIES, THEY ARE DISTRIBUTING FOOD AND MATERIALS IN THE REGION AND SETTLE CONFLICTS. HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE STILL ALIVE IN BERLIN? - LET ME GUESS... 603? WE HAVE 11 BABIES. WHO EXACTLY IS IN CONTROL OF N.L.O.S.I. AT THIS TIME? - OH, THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE. - WHAT DO YOU MEAN, DAD? - THE REACTIVATION OF SolStar-2. THE USE OF SolStar-2 AS A WEAPON OF MASS DESTRUCTION. IT HAS BEEN DEEMED AN ACT OF TERRORISM. - THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS. - CONSIDER YOURSELF UNDER ARREST AND SURRENDER CONTROL OF THE SATELLITE TO US IMMEDIATELY. WHO EXACTLY IS IN CONTROL OF SolStar-2 RIGHT NOW? - AFTER I DESIGNED THE PLAN, WE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BEST THAT HINTZE SHOULD RUN IT. - KLAUS HINTZE? OF COURSE. CAN SOMEBODY TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? - WHAT EXACTLY WAS YOUR PLAN? MY PLAN WAS... MY PLAN IS TO WIDEN THE FOCUS OF THE BEAM TO TARGET AN AREA NEARLY 1,000 KILOMETERS WIDE. THE BEAM WOULD HAVE HARDLY ANY EFFECT. WELL, THAT'S WHAT HINTZE THOUGHT, BUT I COULD PROVE TO HIM, SINCE THE WEATHER HAD VIRTUALLY COME TO A STANDSTILL, IT WOULD ACCUMULATE THE EFFECTS. YEAH, BY BOMBARDING THE COLD LAYER WITH A LOW-INTENSITY MICROWAVE BEAM, YOU COULD CREATE AN ARTIFICIAL WARM FRONT. - RESULTING IN WHAT? - CLIMATE KICK START. AT THIS MOMENT, SolStar-2 IS POWERED UP AND AIMED AT CITIES IN NORTHERN AFRICA. TAKE ME TO THE INSTITUTE RIGHT NOW. - DOCTOR, NOT IN YOUR CONDITION. ANY HAND TOUCHES METAL, YOU'RE DEAD. DOWN. - SO, YOU HAVE BETRAYED ME. - DOCTOR, BE FAIR. HAVEN'T WE BEEN HELPING ALL THE TIME? TAKING MY TECHNOLOGY AND USING IT FOR... COMMIT A MASS MURDER. - IT'S A WAR ABOUT SURVIVAL, AND WE JUST GOT OURSELVES A WEAPON THAT CAN WIN IT. - SO, WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO NOW? - THE QUESTION IS, DOCTOR, DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO? - NO, I DO NOT. - IS EVERYBODY OKAY? - YEAH, I'M OKAY. - I'M GOOD. - ANNA? ANNA. PLEASE, DADDY, DON'T... - DON'T CRY, MY LOVE. I'VE GOT MORE THAN I EVER HOPED FOR. I GOT TO SEE YOU AGAIN. YES, I'M... I'M HERE. MR. STARNDORF, WE NEED THE MASTER CODES AT THE INSTITUTE... - LEAVE US ALONE! REMEMBER... IT'S WHAT YOU ALWAYS SAID. - REMEMBER WHAT? - YOU ALWAYS TOLD ME TO REMEMBER. - REMEMBER WHAT, DADDY? NO. SIR, CAN I SUGGEST THAT WE PUSH ON TO THE INSTITUTE AND TAKE CONTROL BEFORE HINTZE FINDS OUT HIS TEAM FAILED? YEAH, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. MS. STARNDORF, PLEASE COME WITH US. YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS THE FACILITY. BUT I CAN'T LEAVE HIM LIKE THIS. ANNA, HE WOULD HAVE WANTED YOU TO STOP HINTZE. I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR FATHER. HE WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY MAN. I KNOW, BUT FATHER CARED TOO MUCH FOR OTHER PEOPLE AND TOO LITTLE FOR HIMSELF. THAT'S WHY MY MOTHER LEFT HIM. WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE HE DID A LOT OF GOOD FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE. - WHAT ABOUT YOU? WHAT MADE YOU GO LOOKING FOR YOUR FAMILY AGAIN? I THOUGHT THAT WAS ALL YOU WANTED. WE HAVE TO FINISH WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE FIRST... THEN I'LL FIND MY FAMILY. IT LOOKS WE'RE BOTH MUCH MORE RESPONSIBLE THAN WE CARE TO ADMIT. - YEAH, IT LOOKS LIKE IT. - YEP, I'M GONNA PUKE. - DON'T MOVE! - WHERE'S THE DOCTOR? WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH HIM? - HE'S DEAD. - SEE, HERR HINTZE WAS RIGHT. OKAY, H-HOLD ON, WE DIDN'T KILL HIM. - WAIT. THE GIRL WAS WITH THEM. SHE MUST HAVE SEEN WHAT HAPPENED. DID THEY KILL THE DOCTOR? - THEN WHO DID? - NOW, JUST A SECOND! THE REAR ENTRANCE TUNNEL LEADS RIGHT TO THE MAIN LINE. - GUARDED? - ONE GUARD. - HOW MANY PEOPLE INSIDE? FIVE, MAYBE SIX IN THE INSTITUTE, AND TWO MORE PATROLLING THE MAIN TUNNEL. OKAY, SO, WE'RE GONNA NEED YOU TO CREATE A DIVERSION IN THE MAIN TUNNEL TO DRAW THE GUARDS AWAY. YOU THINK YOU CAN DO THAT? - YES. - OKAY! LET'S GO! - WAIT, HOLD ON. - WE STAY. I NEED YOU TO STAY HERE, OKAY? MY DOG, SAS... HE HATES TO BE ALONE, OKAY? SO, SAS. DO YOU THINK YOU CAN STAY WITH HIM UNTIL I COME BACK? YES? OKAY? SAS, STAY. STAY, SAS. ARE YOU SURE THIS WILL WORK, HENLEY? - NEVER FAILS. - HOW DID IT GO? - PERFECTLY. OH, YEAH, AND I DO HAVE A NICE ASS. - OKAY, WE SPLIT UP. YOU'RE WITH ME. COME ON, LET'S GO. GOOD WORK. NO ALARMS. TILL WE'RE THROUGH THAT DOOR, WE MIGHT AS WELL BE IN TANGIERS. YEAH, WELL, LET'S SEE WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST. - HE DOESN'T LOOK WELL. HE'S LOOKING AT A MONITOR. CHECKING THE FLIGHT PATH OF SolStar-2. - NO, NO, IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S... - A SECURITY-CAMERA MONITOR? HEY, GUYS, HOW YOU DOING? WELCOME TO BERLIN! BEEN A FEW CHANGES SINCE YOU WERE HERE LAST, BUT I SUPPOSE YOU NOTICED THAT. HI, ANNA. DID YOU MISS ME? I MISSED YOU. "WHY, SURE, KLAUS. HOW YOU BEEN? WHAT'S GOING ON?" OH, YOU KNOW, NOT A LOT... JUST CHILLING OUT. DO YOU GUYS LIKE MY NEW SECURITY MODIFICATIONS? MNH! NICE SHOT, SOLDIER. WELL, WELL, WELL, COLONEL, UH...WALKER, ISN'T IT? - WHAT DO YOU WANT, HINTZE? - NOTHING YOU CAN GIVE ME...SIR. SIR, YES, SIR! LET'S MAKE A DEAL. WHAT DO YOU WANT? HM, OKAY, UM, I'D LIKE TO TRAVEL THE WORLD, HELP CHILDREN, AND OPEN A BOUTIQUE. NO, I'D ACTUALLY LIKE MY LIFE BACK. YOU KNOW, THE FUTURE I WAS GONNA HAVE... THE WIFE, THE KIDS, THE HOUSE, THE BARBECUE, THE DISTINGUISHED ACADEMIC CAREER. YOU DON'T HAPPEN TO HAVE THAT ON YOU, COLONEL, DO YA? I DIDN'T THINK YOU DID. TRAVELING LIGHT? AND WHAT'S THAT? A PLACE IN THE SUN? LIFETIME SUPPLY OF PLAYMATES? 24/7 HAPPY HOUR AT THE LOCAL BAR? WELL, THAT'S VERY TEMPTING... SUN, WOMEN, AND LIQUOR. MNAH! GODDAMN IT, COLONEL, THROW IN A BACK RUB AND YOU GOT A DEAL! DO YOU THINK THAT ANYTHING THAT YOU COULD OFFER ME COULD COMPENSATE FOR THESE THREE YEARS IN HELL? - HE'S CRAZY. NOW, THAT'S A CHEAP SHOT, COLONEL, AND I RESENT IT. I REALLY DO. "CRAZY"! WELL, EVEN IF I WAS, IT DOESN'T AUTOMATICALLY MAKE ME DEAF, SO BE POLITE. SHOW SOME RESPECT, YOU BASTARD! - KLAUS, WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS? WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO MY FATHER? - ANNA, I LOVE YOUR FATHER. WELL, I LOVED HIM UNTIL I FIND OUT THAT THE HYPOCRITICAL BASTARD HAD GONE AND BETRAYED ME. HE STABBED ME IN THE HEART, AND THAT REALLY HURT. HE TOLD ME SolStar-2 WAS ALL ABOUT PEACE... "BRINGING PEACE TO AN ENERGY-STARVED WORLD"... AND THEN NEGOTIATED WITH THE MILITARY TO FUND IT BEHIND MY BACK... HIS CHIEF ENGINEER, SEVEN YEARS! BET YOU ALL KNOW ALL ABOUT THAT, COLONEL. - KLAUS, IT WAS ABOUT FUNDING. THE WORLD ISN'T BLACK AND WHITE. OH, IT IS. WELL, IT'S WHITE, ANYWAY. IT'S WHITE. IT'S WHITE, WHITE, WHITE, WHITE! BUT YOUR BASTARD FATHER... HE SAID TO ME, "KLAUS, WE MUST STAY HERE AND HELP THE OTHERS UNTIL THE RESCUERS COME." ARE YOU THE RESCUERS? YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE THE RESCUERS. THEY DIDN'T COME! BUT ME AND MY BOYS... WE GOT ORGANIZED. WE KNOW THE DEAL. BUT TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, WE'RE PRETTY PISSED OFF ABOUT BEING LEFT BEHIND, SO WE DECIDED TO GIVE YOU GUYS A WAKE-UP CALL AND, UH, WRITE SOME HISTORY AT THE SAME TIME. YES, SIR. - IT'S NOBODY'S FAULT. I HATE TO CONTRADICT YOU, DARLING, BUT I HAVE THE BIGGEST GUN, WHICH MEANS IT'S WHOSEVER FAULT I SAY IT IS. YOU SEE, I'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF READING WHILE I'VE BEEN HERE... DIDN'T HAVE MUCH ELSE TO DO. SHAKESPEARE... YOU KNOW THAT GUY? HE'S REALLY GOOD, GOT A LOT OF GOOD SOUND BITES. YOU WANT TO HEAR SOMETHING? HOW ABOUT THIS... "AS FLIES, ARE WE, TO THE WANTON GODS. THEY KILL US FOR THEIR SPORT." WHICH MAKES YOU AND EVERYBODY ELSE THE FLIES. AND ME... BAH, WELL, YOU GET THE PICTURE. IF I TRY AND BREAK THIS LOCK, IT WILL SELF-DESTRUCT AND THE PASSWORD IS 512-BIT ENCODED. WELL, WE'VE GOT LESS THAN TWO HOURS BEFORE THAT NUTBAR HAS ENOUGH POWER TO BLOW UP TANGIERS, HERE. - ANNA. ANNA. WE NEED YOUR FATHER'S PASSWORD. - I DON'T KNOW IT. HE TOLD YOU THAT... TO REMEMBER, OKAY? SO IT JUST MEANS YOU KNEW IT AT ONE POINT IN TIME, RIGHT? SO, JUST THINK. WELL, THAT'S SEVEN POINTS FOR TRYING. COME ON, GUYS! YOU CAN GET IT. ONLY 7 TRILLION POSSIBILITIES TO GO. I KIND OF HOPE YOU GET IT. I'D LOVE TO HELP YOU GUYS SINCE WE'RE GETTING ON SO WELL, BUT I GOT MY DUTY. I GOT A JOB TO DO. YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT, COLONEL. AND, UH, YOU KNOW, I GOT A CITY TO DESTROY. YOU CAN STAY AND WATCH IF YOU WANT. - WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU, HINTZE? YOU KNOW, THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING QUESTION. AS A DELAY TACTIC, IT'S ALSO NOT SO BAD. IT'S... IT'S HARD TO ANSWER. IT'S A LOT OF THINGS, YOU KNOW. IT'S BETRAYAL, JUSTICE, REVENGE, WHICH IS VERY SWEET. I'M REALLY BEYOND ALL THAT. LET'S JUST STAY WITH THE INSANE THEORY, HUH? KEEP IT SIMPLE. THAT'S MY MOTTO. YOU KNOW, WE'RE GETTING VERY CLOSE, AND, UH, YOU CAN STAY AND WATCH, BUT YOU GOT TO BE QUIET, OKAY? I LIKE TO WORK TO MUSIC, SO EXCUSE ME. - I DON'T KNOW HIS PASSWORD. COME ON, ANNA. HE TOLD YOU TO REMEMBER. REMEMBER WHAT? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? REMEMBER? REMEMBER WHAT? - WHAT ABOUT HIS FAVORITE COLOR? HE'D COME UP WITH THESE COMPLICATED PASSWORDS THAT HE'D ALWAYS FORGET. WE HAD TO ANALOG HIS NOTEBOOK EVERY WEEK. I ALWAYS TOLD HIM THAT THE ONLY GOOD PASSWORD IS ONE YOU CAN REMEMBER. - THE NAME OF HIS MISTRESS? - WHAT A SECOND. I'VE GOT IT. IT'S "REMEMBER." HEY, HEY, HEY. WAIT. WAIT. HE'LL HEAR THE SYSTEM DISENGAGE. LET'S GET READY. OKAY. AND...GO! - YOU REMEMBERED. BUT YOU'RE TOO LATE! WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO THAT FOR?! HE WAS NO THREAT. I DIDN'T SEE IT LIKE THAT, COLONEL. I HAVE TO TRY TO OVERRIDE THE PROGRAM. DO IT. WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME. OH, MY GOD. THE BASTARD SAW US COMING THE WHOLE WAY. HE'S GOT SECURITY CAMERAS EVERYWHERE. - I USED TO LIVE RIGHT THERE. MY DAUGHTER USED TO PLAY IN THE PARK ACROSS THE STREET. - LISTEN, I'M SORRY. - FOR WHAT? - BEFORE. YOUR FAMILY. ORDERING YOU TO LEAVE. IF YOU'RE ASKING ME TO FORGIVE AND FORGET, COLONEL, NOT GONNA HAPPEN. NOT A SINGLE DAY GOES BY WHERE I DON'T REGRET THAT DECISION TO FOLLOW YOUR ORDERS AND GET ON THAT PLANE. SO, WHY DON'T YOU GO FIND OUT WHAT YOU CAME HERE TO FIND OUT? - SHIT. - WHAT IS IT, HENLEY? LOOKS LIKE YOUR LITTLE FRIEND FOLLOWED US HERE. - IT'S NOT SAFE HERE. - I'LL GO GET HER. - GOOD IDEA, PARKER. SO, HAVE YOU GOT CONTROL OF THE SATELLITE YET? - ALMOST, YEAH. - JUST RELAX, HENLEY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN, COLONEL. I'M VERY RELAXED. SIT DOWN! NOW, SHUT THE DOOR AND CHANGE THE PASSWORD. WE DON'T WANT TO LET PARKER INTERRUPT US, NOW, DO WE? I SUPPOSE YOU'VE PROBABLY GOT SOME QUESTIONS. - YES. JUST AS WELL. I'VE GOT THE ANSWERS, THEN. SEE, WHEN THE MILITARY FOUND OUT THAT THE SATELLITE WAS STILL FUNCTIONING, SOME OF US WEREN'T TOO HAPPY WITH THE IDEA OF DESTROYING A PERFECTLY GOOD WEAPON. UNFORTUNATELY, PRESIDENT HARRISON DIDN'T QUITE AGREE. SO, YOU SEE, I WAS PLANTED ON THIS MISSION TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WEAPON WASN'T DESTROYED. WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH IT? - I WANT TO CHANGE THE WORLD. CHANGE THE WORLD. ANNA, THE ARABS HAVE RAISED THE PRICE OF GAS TO NEARLY $100 A GALLON. THEY'RE SQUEEZING US BECAUSE THEY KNOW 2/3 OF THE WORLD IS HIDDEN UNDER ICE AND NEEDS THE ENERGY. NOW, IF, SAY, SOME ROGUE MILITANT GROUP HIDDEN AWAY UNDER THE ICE TURNS THE SATELLITE ON, SAY, UH, MECCA, I THINK IT COULD BE A VERY DIFFERENT STORY, DON'T YOU? YOU DO THIS AND YOU COULD START A WAR. THERE'S GONNA BE A WAR SOONER OR LATER ANYWAY. SOME OF US ARE SICK OF BEING GUESTS IN OTHER PEOPLE'S COUNTRIES. NOW, WILL YOU PLEASE BE A DEAR AND REDIRECT SolStar-2 ACCORDING TO THESE COORDINATES? - HEY. I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO STAY. THAT'S IT? A SHRUG? A NOD. OKAY. NOW, A NOD'S A DIFFERENT STORY. SAS, YOU KNOW BETTER. COME ON. SHH. SAS. Do you know what happens if I lose my patience? - You'll shoot me? - Very good. AND IN YOUR CASE, I'LL ACTUALLY ENJOY IT. - But then you won't have anyone to control the satellite for you. - OH, YOU SEE, HERE'S THE THING. IF I KILL YOU AND THERE'S NO ONE LEFT TO CONTROL THE SATELLITE, I'LL JUST GO HOME. I'LL HAVE SAVED THE WORLD, SO I'LL BE A HERO. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET HOME? THE TRUCKS ARE GONE. DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT. THAT'S MY PROBLEM. On the other hand, if you help me fry the Arabs then the people that sent me on this mission, they're gonna pay me $10 million. I THINK THAT SHOULD JUST ABOUT BE ENOUGH TO BUY MYSELF A PLACE IN THE SUN. - SHIT. - I need the manual. - WHAT DO YOU THE MANUAL FOR? I THOUGHT YOU KNEW HOW THIS WORKED. I HAVEN'T USED THIS PROGRAM FOR THREE YEARS. HINTZE DID SOME MODIFICATIONS, OKAY? NO, NO, NO. SIT DOWN. I'LL GET IT. WHERE IS IT? - OVER THERE. - KEEP WORKING. - ANNA, YOU ALL RIGHT? - OH, SHE'S JUST FINE, PARKER. NOW, DROP YOUR GUN AND SHE WON'T GET HURT. HENLEY, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING? AAH! - OKAY, OKAY, OKAY, OKAY! THAT WAS JUST A FLESH WOUND. THE NEXT ONE WON'T BE. NOW, REDIRECT MY SATELLITE, OTHERWISE I'LL SHOOT HIM! GET RID OF THE GUN. JUST STAY WHERE YOU ARE, OTHERWISE I'LL SHOOT HER. YOU KNOW, THOUGH, TWO AGAINST ONE KIND OF STILL SEEMS UNFAIR, DOESN'T IT? I ONLY FUCKED YOU TO SCREW WITH YOUR HEAD. BUT ACTUALLY, IT TURNED OUT TO BE QUITE ENJOYABLE. NOW, I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT THIS, BUT I'M SURE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND IT'S JUST SOMETHING I'VE GOT TO DO. STOP! AAH! OH, TOM, DON'T DO ANYTHING STUPID. YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO END UP LOSING ANOTHER LITTLE GIRL, NOW, WOULD YOU? - AAAAAAAAH! WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED? IT LOOKS LIKE WE WEREN'T THE ONLY ONES TRYING TO GET CONTROL OF SolStar-2. - YEAH, NO KIDDING. LET'S KILL THIS SATELLITE AND GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE. - IT'S POSSIBLE. WHAT'S THAT? - MY FATHER'S IDEA. INCIDENTAL CALCULATIONS. IT COULD WORK. SolStar-2 CAN KICKSTART THE WEATHER. - HOW LONG WOULD THAT TAKE? - ALL CALCULATIONS ARE DONE. WE JUST HAVE TO TRY IT. - OKAY. GOOD. LET'S DO IT. WHAT ABOUT THE ORDER THAT WE HAVE TO DESTROY SolStar-2 AT ANY COST? - I TRUST YOU. - OKAY. OH, SHIT. - WHAT'S THE MATTER? THE DISH ON THE ROOF IS DISCONNECTED. - ALL RIGHT. I'LL GO CONNECT THE DISH. YOU KEEP DOING YOUR THING. - ARE YOU SURE? YEAH, YOU HAVE TO PROGRAM THE SATELLITE. - OKAY. YOU THOUGHT IT WOULD BE THAT EASY, YEAH? BYE, PARKER. SO, YOU'RE MAKING A HABIT OF SAVING MY LIFE. I GUESS YOU OWE ME. LET ME KNOW HOW I CAN REPAY YOU. - LET ME THINK ABOUT IT. "I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE IS GETTING THROUGH, "BUT THERE'S ALWAYS HOPE. "THE SUN IS SETTING, "AND I'M GOING TO JOIN OUR LITTLE PRINCESS IN BED. "THE NIGHTS ARE BITTERLY COLD AND GETTING COLDER. "HOLDING HER IN MY ARMS BRINGS US BOTH WARMTH AND COMFORT. "I LOVE YOU. MORE LATER. SANDRA." - I GUESS I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN. NOW IT'S REAL. IF THIS WORKS OUT, THERE WILL BE A LOT TO DO AROUND HERE. LOOKS LIKE YOU MIGHT HAVE DONE IT. - LET'S HOPE. - YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS? THAT'S THE SUN.
