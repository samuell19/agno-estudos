(synthesized crescendo) (drum beat over fuzzy static) (electronic music) - [Voiceover] Where you been, you fuckin' bitch? Waitin' so long. Aw yeah, oh it's worth it. Show it to us, c'mon. Oh I can't wait to see! I want to see it. Stop being a fuckin' tease. C'mon bitch! You're killin' me here. Slow, delicious. Come on, show it to me now! (moaning) Aw yeah, work it. Work it. That's hot. God damn, you fuckin' bitch. Come on, show it to me now! Show it to me now! - Hey Tony1, welcome back. - [Voiceover] Hey. - Do you wanna get off? - [Voiceover] No, um. I wanted to ask you something. Can we private chat for a sec? - Uh, yeah. (chat window opening) - [Voiceover] Can you hear me? - Yup. - Hi. It's me, Sam. - What's up? - Um. Remember a year ago, you said if I was ever in New York... - Yeah? - Yeah well. You're not gonna believe this, but. - What's up? - Well, I'm here. - Here where? New York? - Yes. - That's exciting. - Yeah! Maybe we can meet up, for coffee or something? - Uhh, I. I don't I don't know. That's not really that... - I mean, look, Carla, do you remember six months ago? What you said to number five when he caught his wife cheating on him? You said, um, "Life is too short." That you need to find someone who likes you for what you are. Someone who loves you for who you are. I don't want just this online thing with you. I want I want to meet you in real life. - [Carla] (sighs) Listen, Sam. I don't do this, okay? And you shouldn't be asking me this. So, uh. - Yeah, okay. I'm gonna go now. (key clicks) - Shit. - Hey. - Hey girl. - [Carla] How'd it go? - It's all good. But damn girl, need to get a vaccine for this shit already. I take this test every three months, and I fuckin' hate needles. Hold up, girl. Did I tell you about the fuckin' freak I met last night? - What're you talking about? - Girl! So I'm workin' my corner, holdin' my shit down. All of a sudden this trick comes along, talkin' bout he wants a date. I'm about to tell the motherfucker to get lost, when all of a sudden he pulls some Benjamins on me. Girl, I get in his car. 10-98, we're back at my spot. We take care of business. I'm all excited and shit. And then he tells me he wants to choke on my weapon, girl. - [Carla] Oh my God! - [Cinnamon] But of course, he fucking can't get off! So then all of a sudden he tells me to pistol whip his ass. - [Carla] What did you do? (loud thud) - (laughing) Where they find these motherfuckers? - I don't know girl, but you always do. - 'Cause I'm a professional. - Gotta work it! - (laughing) The shit I have to do to make a coin. Right before he blacked out, he asked to see me again. - You're not going to, are you? - Girl, that money was cute. Every single man wants a woman with a thick, (men cat calling) juicy, delicious secret. - [Man in striped shirt] Awoo! - Damn nigga, what is with all this shit on your face? - Santii baby, you wouldn't know a real woman if she fuckin' beat your sorry ass. - (scoffing) I don't see no real ladies here. - Yeah, where they at? - The fuck are you doin' bitch? - Yo my nigga, you gonna let her do that shit to you? - No, I ain't no fag, nigga. - [Cinammon] You know you want it. Stop denying it. - [Man in striped shirt] Fuck. - What the fuck do you want? Why are you bothering me? - I ain't bothering you, bitch. - Leave me alone, Ramon! - [Cinnamon] The fuck up! (screaming) - I got you, bitch. - [Cinnamon] I'll fuck you up! - Watch your back! (heavy breathing) - (laughing) Oh shit, girl! (clears throat) - Girl, work. - [Cinnamon] Girl, they can't take all a' this! And they can't take all a' this, honey! - [Carla] And they can't take all this (laughs). - [Cinnamon] Girl, did you see Santii? Oh damn! Shit. Damn girl, I need to get me a pair of those. - I can make you better shoes than that. - Then why don't you, bitch? You know you can design rings around all those other bitches. Hm! Walk me to work. Goodbye, shoes! (door slams) (phone beeps) - [Voiceover] You have two new messages. - [Voiceover] Hi Carla. It's Phil from Bleecker Street Pharmacy. The doctor called in your prescriptions, you can pick it up any time you want. (phone beeps) - [Voiceover] Hi Carla, it's your grandfather. I wanted to remind you we're havin' lunch this Saturday at my house. I'm making your favorite, quiche! Okay? Haveta go, love ya. (whispers to herself while typing) (bath water runs) (knocking) - Carla. - Hi, grandpa. - Come on in. - How are ya? - Mm, okay. Go have a seat in the living room, darling.

And then when you're finished, you're gonna make up some excuse and you're gonna get the fuck outta here. - What's goin' on out here? Frankie, what'd you say to your sister? Apologize to her. You do it now or ya get the hell outta my house. (fork clatters) - [Frankie] Let's go. (door slams) (birds chirping) - What a waste of time. Sorry. - You coulda told me. - Would you have come? - That's not the point! - Yes it is the point. I know, you think they hate you. But they don't, they're your family. God knows I have a hard enough time accepting what you're going through, I really do. Ya just have to face this head on. There's nothin' to be afraid of. - I gotta go. (chat window opening sound effect) - [Voiceover] Hi, I'm Sam. - How you doin'? Can we have some fun tonight? - Can I talk to you? (sighs) - Baby, I got some business I need to take care of. Don't go nowhere, okay? Girl. Well fuck you, motherfucker! Shit! (sighs) Spit it out girl, the longer you're here the more you fucking money you're costing me. - I know, I know but, girl, you know that nerdy guy I talk to? - Right, the weirdo? - Yeah. Aren't they fuckin' all? - So he wants to meet. - So meet him, girl. - Well like a date. - And the problem is? - Jesus, I don't... - Girl, if you want to meet him meet him. If you don't, don't. But if you do decide to meet him, make sure you do it somewhere in public with lots of people around. These folks on the internet, they fuckin' crazy. Now get the fuck outta here, you're messin' with my money. - Okay, girl. - [Cinnamon] Girl, your nipples are showin'. (gentle music plays) - [Man] Oh you can fill mine up, I'm not driving or anything. - [Both] Thank you. - Its nice to finally meet you. Cheers. - (clears throat) I'm a little nervous. - Um, tell me about the new job. - Oh um, I'm a programmer. - Programmer, uh? - Computers!

Singularity is this very advanced new way of thinking by this really great mathematician named Kurzweil and he developed this whole new futuristic way of of um, you know. Um. So um. So um.

I gotta go. - We need to talk. Please? - What is it? - Well. What happened last night? - 'Scuse me! I'm from Brooklyn. Nothing. Which is what should have happened, okay? - Well. Really? 'Cause I thought it was just supposed to be me and you? - Oh girl. Girl! Mmhm. This him? - [Carla] Those are my friends, okay, so if you don't like them you don't like me alright? (laughing and shrieking) - This a blind motherfucker! (laughter) - Yeah, well. It just seemed like you were trying to ruin everything. - Hey, may I walk you home? - (laughs) You're not gonna get into my pants okay? - No, no, I didn't. I didn't mean it like that. - You comin' bitch? - Go home, whitebread. - Jesus christ, Sam. (sighs) Are you done?

What's so unbelievable? - [Carla] Where are you? Nevermind, I see you. What the fuck happened to your face, Cinnamon? Cin, who did this? - Remember that trick I was tellin' you about? The one with the gun? - I didn't think you were gonna see him again. - The coins were cute girl! (laughs uproariously) Hey daddy, you wanna date? Mind your own fucking business! Bitches. (laughing) What, girl? Ain't all fuckin' got a knight in shining armor who's gonna come and save our sorry asses. Some of us fuckin' have to hustle for it. (snorts) - Bullshit, Cin. You don't have to do this. - The fuck do you know, you fuckin' white bitch? That's right I said it. What? I'm losin' a fucking date because of you. - Cin, you have to stop. Promise me you'll stop. - Whatever girl. - Promise me you'll stop this! - (laughing) Okay girl, I promise girl. I'll stop okay? I'm sorry girl (laughs). It's been a long day okay? - Okay. What's this one? (phone ringing) - This is Carla. - [Voiceover] Hi, may I speak to Ms. Deluca please? - Yes? - [Voiceover] Hi Carla, I'm Henry Dupont from Entral Investment Group. You submitted your resume to us a few days ago? - I did? Yes, I did, I did. - [Voiceover] Well, I just wanted to let you know, looks great. If you're up for it, we'd love to line up some interviews for you. - That. Great! Yes! - Um (laughs) not um. Not singularly, it's singularity. It's um, it's what I was talking to you at dinner about. - Right right right. - So it's a different word and it's a different thing. - Oh shit. - What? - Let's go this way. - Here chicky chicky chicky chick. You know what you got there, white boy? - Leave us alone, Santii. - You know, Carla she's my favorite...

I have a bunch of interviews. - [Voiceover] Interviews? - Yeah, a design thing. I decided to give it a shot. Just like you said. Hello? - [Voiceover] Yeah, that's great. Good for you. You know where to find me. (phone ringing) - Grandpa, I'm about to go in for a meeting, can I call you back? - [Voiceover] I'm only gonna take a sec, can you meet me later for lunch or coffee? - Yeah, I'll call you back. I gotta go, okay? - [Voiceover] Good. Good, don't forget now. - I won't. Okay, bye. Sorry. - Oh no problem. They're ready for you now, please follow me. - Okay. - Ronny, have Bruno call my cell. Hello. Kay. You went to CUNY? - Yes. (phone rings) - Hello, Bruno? Do you have no prior experience in the business? - No, but I've been working on my own designs while working customer service. - Hello? What the hell happened? How should I know? You're the designer, aren't you? Well that's not what they told me. Okay Bruno, I'm not going to get into this right now. Thank you for your time, Miss Deluca. I don't know, all I know is that they want you to fix it. Yeah! That would be great. Because I need that thing yesterday, okay? - It's too steep. - Excuse me? - The arch, it's too steep. It's gonna create a pressure point at the bottom of the foot. The opening in the toe is way too narrow. It's gonna pinch the toe. And uh, it's boring. - Huh! (gentle piano music) - Carla, please? Have a seat. - What's going on? - You look very beautiful. I like your jacket, your whole outfit is very lovely. - He didn't tell me either. - I didn't tell either of you for a reason. Listen because this is important to me. You too please. I want some peace in my family, and love. That's all I'm asking for. - Not when he's like this. - He? - You know what I mean. - Really ma, tell me what you mean? - Do we really have to go through this again? You know your dad is beside himself? - Dad? Why the fuck are you sticking up for dad? I'm your kid, mom. - Yeah, well you wouldn't know it. - Look at me ma! - I am doin' the best I can. - You're doin' the best you can, you're leavin' your kid all by himself. - Himself. You can't even accept what you are. What are you? - I'm your kid, ma. - I don't know you anymore. I want to, but I don't you. - Enough, enough! All that I want... - I don't care what you want, dad. - Carl is only thinking of himself, that is all... - Carla! It's Carla. - You can call yourself whatever you want. But if you don't go back to what you truly are then you are just a freak. - Wait, wait, wait. - It's alright, it's alright. Wait Carla, please. Please? (train rumbling) (knocking) - [Voiceover] Hi, it's me Sam. (knocking) What happened? - I met my um. Seems so stupid. I met my grandpa for lunch and my mom was there. - Oh. - And she just tore into me. I had to get outta there. - [Carla] (breathes out) Uhh. I, I just. Can't right now. Can you just hold me? (tender music) (car horns) (pills rattling) - (yawning) Do you have any aspirin? - Uh yeah, in the kitchen. - (yawning) Okay. Ahh. Hi. - Hi. - Thanks for the aspirin. - What aspirin? - The aspirin you left, right next to the glass of water. - Those weren't aspirin. Those were my hormones. (choking and coughing) - Hormones? What? What hormones? - [Carla] My estrogen. - What? What's? Wait, what's gonna happen to me? Seriously, I don't feel good (coughs). - Oh shit, I don't... - [Sam] (coughing) - You're gonna. - What? - You're gonna grow tits. - What? - Your skin's gonna get soft. - Seriously? What? - Nothing's gonna happen! - [Carla] (laughing) - Huh? - You're fine. Cheers (laughs). - Ha ha. Ha. I still don't feel good. - Do you want coffee? - Yes please. - How do you want it? - Um. Milk, sugar. No estrogen. - It would be so fucking great to wake up and not have to take estrogen and testosterone blocker. - How many, uh. How many do you have to take? - Estrogen? Two in the morning, two at night. - That's 1,440 pills a year. What does estrogen and testosterone blockers do? - Makes me tired, depressed. And lovely hot flashes. Lots of fun stuff. But this is what I want. This and surgery. (cars honking) - Su-surgery? Okay, um. What's holding you back? - Each surgery is really expensive. - Each? - [Carla] One, two, three. Jesus christ. Gramps, are you sure it's back here? I don't see anything. Are you okay? - I'm alright, I'm alright. - Sit down. - Alright. (grunts) I'll tell ya the truth, darling. That wasn't really why I called you over. I wanted to apologize. - For what? - For lunch. I ambushed you. I just didn't know any other way to get the two of you to talk together, ya know? And look how well that turned out. I don't know, I thought if I could get the two of you to talk together then, then things would be better, you know what I mean? - Yeah, but gramps, she's pissing me off. It's whatever he says goes. She always takes his side, it's like she doesn't even exist anymore. - Truth be told, sweetheart, it isn't your fault. Your mother just isn't that big a person. She's not that evolved. As much as she wants to protect you she just can't go that far. And decided to go the whole way, she just couldn't do it, it's too traumatic for her. That woman who you seek is in there somewhere. I think. Maybe. I do hope. We have to put this back. - Gramps, let me do it. Gramps, no, let me do it. - Okay, go ahead. - Jesus! Oof! - And straighten out the rug. I wanna get my money's worth. - [Carla] (laughing) Good? - That's good, thank you. Come here. I just remembered something. You know, when your mother found out she was pregnant she was going to school, she was gonna take up a profession. And you know what she did, she dropped out. - Why? - Because she either had to marry your father or have an abortion. And she made her choice. And that was a loving choice, that was a loving mother's choice. Understand what I'm saying? - I gotta go, gramps. - Why do you always have to go? - I'll talk to you later? - Of course. (train rumbling over persistent drum beat) (electronic music) - [Voiceover] Yo you missed a spot! Under the table! Bend down bitch! - [Voiceover] Shit. - [Voiceover] Damn, I can't see it. Come on bitch, let us see it! - [Voiceover] So sexy. Bend down, further. Let me see that sweet ass. (phone ringing) - Hi mom, uh. (deep breathing) (somber piano music) - And to my grandson, Frances Deluca, I leave my automobile, my military uniform and medals. And finally, to my granddaughter, Carla Deluca. - Can we talk about this? - There's nothin' to talk about, Diane. He's just gonna waste it! Where do you think you're goin'? - Home. - It's not your money! - Listen here, listen to me. You spend one penny of that money on that shit-show operation of yours and I will fucking end you. What happened to you? You used to be my brother. Now you're just a circus freak. (phone dialing) (phone ringing) - [Voiceover] Hi, it's me Sam. Leave me a voicemail message after the tone. - Hey Sam, it's me. Can you call me back? I need to talk. - [Cinnamon] Shit. Mothafuckas is cheap today! Don't fuckin' have time for this shit. Some fuckin' money. Fuckin' feet hurt. How'd it go girl? - Sucked. - I'm sorry, girl. I know he's the one who was family for you. Speakin' of which, how are the assholes? - Still assholes. - Well girl, fuck 'em, right? Fuck 'em! (laughs) - I wish it was that easy. My grandpa left me some money. - So what girl? How much we talkin'? - 400. - Bitches, stop! What the fuck! I said stop bitches. Bitches stop! Stop this shit. What the fuck are you doin'? Professional! I don't have time to put up with this shit. Fuckin' hoes. Damn! What the fuck is their problem? 400 dollars? They're givin' you shit over 400 dollars? Shit! - 400 thousand. - You shittin' me. - No. - 400 G's? Girl. Well you know what you gotta do. You gotta handle your business. You gotta get all your shit taken care of, and fast, because you might not get another chance like this. You know if it was fuckin' me with that money, what I would do? I would fuckin' live a life I'm supposed to be livin'. Instead of all this fuckin' bullshit I have to deal with. I would be the woman I was supposed to be. And motherfuckers would respect me. I would be somebody, girl. So you gotta do that for both of us. Handle it for both of us, girl. (gentle jazz music) - How're you? - How're you? - So, my fucked up family is planning on suing me. - What? Why? - My grandpa left me some money. - A lot? - 400 grand. - Huh. - I know, right? Cin thinks I should take the money and go for the operation. - The operation? Yeah but, you could do so much with it. I mean, think about it. With all this money now you don't have to do your site, you could do your design thing if you want. - Do you think I like doing this shit, Sam? - No. - It tears me up inside. I figured I'd do this until I had enough money for surgery. - So, that's it? You made your decision, you're gonna go through with it? - No, I don't know. I haven't decided. - I don't understand. - Do you know what it's like to live like this? - No. - This is not what I'm supposed to be. Don't you want me to be happy? - I do. It's just that... - What? - I like you the way you are. (train rumbles) - Hey, have you guys seen Cin? - Oh shit, bitch didn't hear. (laughing) - Can you tell me where the fuck she is? - Motherfucker she was with messed her up real fuckin' good. Dumped her sorry ass right on this corner. Ambulance decided to come and get her, took her to St. Nick's. - Where is that, where is St. Nick's? - Shit. Do I look like Google Maps to you? - [Both] (laughing) Get the fuck outta here! - Fucking bitch. (kissing noises) (heart monitor beeping) - Hey girl. - You were right, girl. I shoulda listened to you. - You're gonna be okay. - How did you know where to find me? - Your girlfriends down on the corner. - (scoffs) Friends. Yeah right. (sighs) Those bitches. They're probably glad I'm not there. More tricks for them. I need to fucking quit that corner, girl. You so lucky, you know. You got a good man. He ain't gonna hurt you like this. - I'm not so sure about that. He doesn't want me to have the surgery. He said he can't be with me if I change. - Well maybe you shouldn't. - [Carla] What? - Maybe you shouldn't ruin a good thing. - But you said I should go... - Look at me. Do you think this is any kinda good life? Even when something good happens to one of us it's still shit. I don't have a grandpa who's gonna die and leave me 400 G's. I don't have somebody who's gonna love me for who I am. You gotta hold onto him. Girl you gotta hold onto him. - But you said I need to be me. And Sam doesn't want me to be me. He wants whatever this is, and this is not me. It can't be me. - I was wrong. - [Nurse] Excuse me, is everything okay in here? - Do you know how rare it is for one of us to even find a man at all? - [Nurse] Is there a problem? - No. - Wait, wait. Look at me. (chat message dings) (chat message dings) (chat message dings) (chat message dings) (chat message dings) (sobbing quietly) (birds chirping) (sighing) (pill bottle slamming) (sighing deeply) - Fucking (drowned out by pills clattering) ! (loud sobbing) (sobbing and gasping) - Hello? Hello? - Hello? - What are you doing here? - Someone has to pack up all of this. - Surprised dad didn't come to see what he could steal. What is it, ma? Ma? - Your dad is gone. - What? - He left me. You know, I always thought it would be me. (laughs) - Wasn't even his father and he wanted that money. He left me because I told him he couldn't have it. I told him it was yours. Look, Carl. Carla. You need to do this thing? Fine, you go ahead and do it. I don't know how I feel about it. I guess I hate it, I don't know. But you're my kid. (gentle piano music) (door slams) - [Voiceover] You have no message. - Hello it's... - Come in. I've decided. - You're doing it. - Uh huh. - I don't understand you, I don't. - You said you want me to be happy. - I do. - How can you be with somebody who hates who they are? Don't ruin this. - I'm not ruining this! I'm not ruining it, you're ruining it! You're ruining it 'cause you're the one that's changing. - Sam, I've hated this body my whole fucking life. But I can change that. I'm almost there. - Almost there, Carla? Aren't you the one that told me that it's gonna take years of surgery? It's not happening over night. - I know that but I can do this. I want to do this. And I want you there. - I thought you changed your mind! - I want this, Sam. - More than me? - Fuck you. - Fuck me, great. - Are you gay, Sam? Is that what it is? Do you like me because I have a dick? (door slams) Answer me! - No. You're beautiful. - This is beautiful? This is fucking beautiful!? - Stop! - Are you a faggot, Sam? - What if I am? What does it make you? - Get out. Get out! Get out!
