Present ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN This is amazing! - Good morning. - Good morning. - What are you doing? - You can see. Why are you asking if you can see? But I'd like to know. Are you getting ready? Time to go. It's cold today. Get on your bike, or you'll get cold. - It's a scooter. - A scooter, then. I don't have a bike. Ask your mum to get you one. My mummy's not here, but my daddy is. What's your name? What's my name? Don Juan. Yes? Didn't you make it up? No, I didn't. - And my name is Tomek. - Tomek. It's a nice name. Yours is very pretty, too. - Tomek - a very nice name. - I'm Tomek Łoziński. - What's that? - Tomek Łoziński. - Łoziński. - Yes, and you? Well, I'm Don Juan. But what's your last name? Juan. Really? You've got such a French name. - How do you know it's French? - Because I know. - You are very elegant. - Oh, thank you very much. - You also have a very nice jacket. - A real man. A very pretty jacket. You look good in it. And you both have very nice, white gloves. That's right. Everyone's got something, right? But you can change yours. - One like this and one like that. - One is long and one is short. - Why? - Just for fun, for laughs. Look, this one goes with my trousers, and my hat and my handbag. And this one goes with my jacket. - And with this. - See? That's right. You're something. Good morning. - Good morning. - Morning, sonny. - You're a nice boy. - Got a driver's licence? No. But I can ride here. - Do you know, where the right and where the left side is? - No. - One should know that. - Where is your right hand? - This one. - Which one do you cross your self with? - Do you say your prayers? - Pardon? Do you say your prayers? No, you don't? - You do not pray? - No. That's why you can't tell the right hand from the left. - If you prayed, you could tell. - Right - left. Right hand, left hand. - How old are you? - You could say 70. - And you, madame? - The same. - 70? - Not yet. I'm 60. - You're a little older. - Yes, I'm older. I'm the man. I'm older, I know the world. And I think, that you should learn to pray to God. God created everything: the flowers and the people. Nature did it. Nature created the flowers. God created nature, the universe, everything. One should pray to God to ask him for wisdom. I once did a sin. Well, humans aren't perfect, they do commit sins. I once said that God's a bull. One has to ask God for forgiveness and everything will be all right. People, who don't believe in God, are just like animals. One has to believe. Because one has to respect one's mother, father, grandma, grandpa, boyfriends, girlfriends... everybody. But my grandpa died. Well, okay. Then you should go and light a candle on his grave. Say a prayer for his soul. Thank God for your grandpa, for your mom, for your dad. You have to be happy, polite and shouldn't throw litter around. You have to be cultured. Everything comes from faith. Bye! Is there anything underground? Pardon? - Is there anything underground? - I don't know. Me neither, but there should be something. Something that holds it. - Holds what? The Earth? - No... this weight. - What should that be? - The mass. - The mass of Earth holds the earthly weight, right? - Yes. Are you interested in galaxies? What's a galaxy? Galaxy is planets like: the Earth, the Moon, Venus, Mars, Jupiter... Guess, what will happen, when the Moon and the Sun come together? That's impossible. - But if it happens? - It's out of the question. Do I look young or old? - What? - Rather old. Really, so old? - Not so much... but old. - Not so much. But old. I'm not young anymore. I'm almost 70 -that's not young. - And the young... - And I'm 5... I'm 6 already. Oh, so you are very young. And I'll have three birthday parties. My birthday party was yesterday... and maybe I'll have... You know what, sonny? Don't try to grow up too fast. Being grown up is nothing but trouble. Life's best, when you are little. It's a good loving life. Mummy hugs you. You've got a good mummy, haven't you? See? And daddy hugs you sometimes... - So how did it happen? - Well, the war broke out and there were no conditions to study. And to go to the University when the war broke out. And you had to escape from the war. One could not escape from the war. It was everywhere, in the whole of Europe. So there was no escape from the war. The war messed up your plans? Criss-crossed them - like a swastika? Like a sign of swastika. Because the Nazis invaded Poland and destroyed our plans, our cities... But, luckily, they are repaired. Anyway... what we went through... I wouldn't wish for you to experience that. - You should have a better life. - Did you win, sir? I didn't win anything, I just lived through two wars. - Two? - Yes. I've got a computer game, and there is a helicopter and tanks... Sometimes, you have to kill, sometimes you don't kill... And they hide in the bushes and you have to shoot at these bushes. There are also the hardest of all obstacles... - I've been through a lot. - Really? War is a horrible thing. But what is it for? Who knows? Actually, it's a crazy thing. People fight God knows what for. When you are my age, probably there won't be any wars. No wars at all. And when I'm your age... will you be still alive? Oh, no. Not anymore. I'll be long dead. But it can happen, that you will be still alive. - I might live few more years. - How long? - We'll see. Maybe 2, maybe 5, maybe... - Maybe 20. - No, 20 is impossible. I'd be over 100 years old then. I'd be 115 years old. People don't live that long. - But one can be 115 years old. - No, there aren't such people. Usually, the people, who live long are 101, or 102 years old. And not 103? - Some live to be 103... - How about 104,105? My grandpa had a lot of life ahead of him, but he died of a disease. How old was he? I don't know how old he was. Some and something. Sir, when I'm old, will you still be alive then? I doubt it. You would like me to live, then? Yes, very much. But you see, people don't live so long. - But it may happen. - It may, naturally. Some people may live to be over 100. Or 600 years old. People don't live that long. But it may happen. It could happen once in life. - Anything can happen in life. - Yes, but these are rare cases. One can come across some rare cases, but it's very rare. One can meet a baby dinosaur. Clench your hand. Make a fist. You'll have two wives. Two women are meant for you. As a young boy, you'll be very popular with the girls. Short and fleeting, but lots of them. Well, your life... Two life paths. One longer, one shorter. But so far there were crosses on your way. They belong to the past, but... - What are these crosses? - Some tragedy. Maybe you went through some illnesses. You're still lucky. Maybe luck won't pass you by. You're right. Once I shrank and you might shrink as well. You shrank? What do you mean? - Instead of getting bigger, I got smaller. - That can't be. You're a phenomenon. They should write about you in books. One can't get smaller. Who told you that you did? My dad measured me. - I was this high and then... - Maybe your dad was kidding. - No he wasn't. - That would be impossible. You're very big. Everything about you is so big. But I'm swollen. Look Your stomach is swollen too. And what a huge head. Everything is swollen. The most important thing in life is health. If you're healthy, you'll work, you'll earn money, - You'll have everything. - I'll be rich. - You'll be happy. - And you'll give it to the poor. You'll give it to the poor, but if you're ill... you'll work only for yourself, for your medicine. You won't enjoy life anymore. But you still enjoy life, because you aren't lying in bed yet. I'm really glad that I can walk, because there was a time, that I couldn't. Very strange. You have strange glasses. They're tied with a wire. Yes... because I broke them. - Is your shirt torn? - Pardon? - Is it torn? - No. It's not. Why are you poor? Why? Because I haven't got much money. And that's why? I've got only my pension, because I don't work any more. And that's why you are poor? It's because I don't have money. - How do you manage? - I live on my pension. It's not much. When you work, you earn a lot and you're rich. I have some for you. And for you. And for you, too... of course. Why are you collecting bottles? To have some money for bread. To eat something... - But these are empty bottles. - Yes, naturally, they're empty. - What do you do with them? - I sell them. - But the empty ones. - I sell them at a shop or at a recycling place... And that's how I get money for food. You sell these empty bottles and they pour something in them? For sure there is a place, where they wash these bottles and then they fill them with something. - And they give you money? - Yes. - And you live on it. - Yes, I do. Do you have great-grandchildren and grandchildren? No, I don't have children. - You're alone? - Yes, all alone. You had children and they got married? No, I didn't have children at all. - Only you and your husband? - Yes, just the two of us. It's a difficult thing to say... but... you divorced your husband and that's why you're alone? I divorced him. We didn't get on together well and I divorced him. You didn't agree over what? - What didn't you agree over? - You know, we quarrelled a little. My husband had a thing for alcohol, you know how it is. And that's why we divorced. And who stayed in your house? My husband did. - And you went a little bit further? - Yes, to the railway station. I've been homeless for 10 years. I live at the station. I collect bottles, like I told you. Out of the litter-boxes? Out of litter-boxes or when they are lying around. My mum also picks up litter that lies around. - Your mum does? - Yes. Because, she hates it, when there's a mess. - Who did you want to be? - Me? A farmer. I love horses. I always wanted to be near them. I really like them. - Horses. - Yeah, I like horses a lot. - Horses are great. - Yes. Then I grew up and things changed... and I didn't get to be a farmer. I got to be a mechanic. For cars? Yes. And then I even got to be a janitor. A janitor? In which kindergarten? I didn't work in kindergarten. So where were you a janitor? - In jail? - No. No, not a jail. In a housing cooperative. And if you were born again, what would you like to do? If I was born again? Well, sweetie... Now, I would know what to dream about. Now, I wouldn't dream about horses... I'd dream to be somebody different... A president, or a minister. So that I wouldn't have to work hard. - Or a king. - A king - why not? But now, I've lost my health... - my legs hurt when I walk. - And you can't be born once again. That's true. Can't be born again. But this may happen to me, or to you? Well, it could happen, but... It hasn't happened to anyone yet. I haven't heard about it. In the News. Yes. Are you alone, or somebody loves you? Maybe somebody loves me besides God, but I live alone. And where is your wife? My wife... I don't live with her. - You got separated? - Yes, we did. Why? There were some reasons and we had to. - You have to get separated one day. - So it seems. You have to. You want to be together, but you have to get separated. That's the rule. That's the rule. If something doesn't work out... if it doesn't go well, people have to get separated. - And if it goes well, they don't have to. - Sure, they don't. - People can be together till death. - So it should be. The children are with the mum? Or are they with you? Some stayed with their mum, some with me. But they're grown up now, and married. And you are both alone. And I'm all alone. And your wife too. And my wife too. My wife is not alone. She got married again and she's with her husband now. And I'm all alone. My dad and my mum haven't got separated yet. They are still together. - Obviously, they do not need to. - I wonder, who I will stay with, when they split in two halves. Who will I stay with? With my clad, or with my mum? It will depend on you. I wouldn't know, who to choose. So they'd better not split up, right? So that everything would be as it was before. - Are you sad and alone? - Pardon? - Are you sad and alone? - No, absolutely not. - Who are you with? - I'm by myself, but I'm not sad. Because you're with your grandson? I'm alone, but I've got plenty to do. So I don't have time to be sad, besides, there's no reason. Why do you think, that I should be sad? Because you're alone. Well... I'm happy. - Why? What's important? - And what do you think? I think.. It's important to be healthy... and to have money. You're right... especially about the health. And money is less important. And the most important thing is to be able to accept life and oneself. But, I guess, you don't know what 'to accept' means. - I don't. What does it mean? - It means... to think that life is good, as it is. - To accept somebody. - ...and that a human being... - What's that? - A swan. - A swan? - Yes. Ah yes, on the little island. How does it happen? The years keep coming. First one, then two, five, ten... twenty and so on... and one gets old. You keep shaking when you show something. - Is it... - No. And then I went further, and higher, and years went by... - And... - And who did you become? I taught at school. - You were a teacher. - Yes. And then, as the years went by... I had to stop teaching, because my hands... - Are you scared? - No, I'm not. - That you will die? - No, I'm not. When you reach a certain age, you know, that you will have to die. - How old are you? - I'm very old. I'm 80 years old, already. - How old? - I'm 80. - 80 years. I'm very old. - Not so old. - Very old. - After 80, there's 90. To be 90, I'd have to wait 10 more years. Are you happy about your life? Am I happy about my life? - No. - Why not? Because I'm lonely. - I'm all alone. - One has to be always happy in life. One should be happy, but it's not always possible. When you are lonely, and many things are missing... then you're not... you're not happy anymore. - And what do you miss? - What do I miss? I'd like to live with somebody... To be together... When you have family... and children... you live happily then. And you want to live. But when you are alone life is difficult. And when did you cry last time? I cry very often. - But when? - Even now I feel like crying. Really? That's the end of the conversation. It's strange, that when somebody asks you about it... you want to cry. No... - Good bye. - Good bye. Stay in good health. I wish you good health, too. ...and if you study hard... - Will you be here tomorrow? - I will. - On the same bench? - Yes. - So I'll come, too. - I'll be here then. You know, this year my dearest wife died. The most beautiful woman in the world. And the best. But I'm not going to cry. Don't worry. Now my children look after me. Do you think, you will meet your wife again? I'll tell you something. I'm still seeing my wife. The house is full of her. I can hear her going about her chores. That's the impression I get. I keep telling myself, that she is still with me. My wife was very dear to me. Just like my mum... She thinks, that my grandpa, who died... - ...that he is still there. - Yes. I think so, too. If somebody dies, it doesn't mean, that you will not meet them again. It doesn't mean they died completely. Because their memory lives on, all the good things they did... People remember them and they keep saying that it was such a good person. People live as long as others talk about them. If somebody died, it does not mean, you'll never see them again. It may happen, that there will be death... and then the death will be over and life will return. It can happen.
