He's been going by the name of Victor Stavros for a while now. And where is he? See, that's the complicated part. Where's my son? Valverde State Prison. He's in prison? He's fine. He's doing a stint for robbery and a bunch of other shit. They're trying to pin the death of an undercover cop named Ramon Chavez on him, but it's not sticking, seen as Chavez shot at Vincent and his driver. Wait a minute, he shot my son? I said he's fine didn t I? Ok, wait. This prison, where is it? California. Copy that. Check's in the mail. 4A. To the desk. Personal belongings. Glasses. Sign in, first name, last name, time in. See my colleague? Face me. Arms out to your side, feet spread apart. Turn around. You guys done? We're done. Thank you, Mr. Smith. What are you, 6' 3"? 6' 5". OK. Hello, son. Hi, Alex. Back to using first names again, right? How'd you find me? It doesn't matter. It was Kirk, wasn't it? The fucking narc still diming people out to you after all these years. He's a good friend. He's a fucking tool. What do you want? I don't need to want anything. I'm your father. Victor, huh? At least that's what I said on my fake ID. Funny thing is it was your mother's first choice. Her great grandfather's name. We ended up tossing a coin, and Vincent won. Yeah. I know that story. Yeah. Penny. Yeah? How are you holding up in here? [inaudible] bring my fucking [inaudible].. I don't know. I mean-- Kirk mentioned something about an undercover cop. What about him? Man, it's me you're talking to, OK? I'm not an attorney. And assume I already know what happened. I just want to hear your side of the story. Buddy and I we, ran off with some cholo's payload over in East Hollywood. Security must have tipped him off because his muscle caught up with this pretty fast. Muscle was undercover. No, he's a fucking cop. Fuck, he was so dirty. Did you shoot the police officer? What if I did? Yeah, it's not like you don't have any experience killing people. That was different Vinny. That was a job. I had to put food on the table. Same fucking difference. Look, it's been fun, Alex. Just wait. Make it fucking quick then. Get the fucking-- Who do you think I am? You can I'm a fucking idiot? You think I'm stupid? I know I wasn't around enough for you growing up. I know that. Come on, try ever. Well, I'm trying now. I'm trying now, Vinny. Now you had [inaudible] fucking [? leave. ?] What are you going to do now, especially now, now that I'm in here in you're out there? Listen, Vinny, how many times do I have to go through this with you? I've explained it. I have to tell it you over and over. Yeah, you can explain shit every time. Black Ops, top secret. So fucking cool. There comes a time when you just heard enough. Hey, don't fucking touch me! Oh! Fuck! Oh! Shit. Fucking asshole. What the fuck was paying for, man? Too fucking cool. All I'd ever do at school is talk about how fucking cool you are. I had my prom date asking, where's your dad? But the real kicker is when your mom is on her deathbed, and she's begging to see her husband just one last time. And all I could do was lie to her. That's all I could do. Tell her, hey, no, no. He's on-- he's on the way. He's coming. He's going to be here. You just hang on there a little bit longer. You skip holding her hand, nice and firm. You know, like what it means to be there until finally I just felt her stop holding my hand back. That should have been you! Hey, watch it. Settle down. That should have been you. I'm-- I'm sorry, Vinny. I'm really sorry. You don't even know what that word fucking means. Vinny. [crying] So what? You think you can just get me out of here, hmm? You really think so? There's no such thing as a guarantee. I'm not playing these fucking games anymore. Come on, Vinny. Why don't you just fucking leave. Leave! Leave! Fuck you. Fuck you. [music playing] [chatter] Yeah, I can't wait to get out of here. Let's get this going. We have 10 more after this one. [music playing] Inmate 201693, Maximilian Ezekiel Chandler. You certify that this is you? That's me. Warden. Chandler. How's the stab wound? Healed up nicely. How's the taser marks? [chuckles] Sergeant Baker, nice of you to join us today. I wouldn't miss this for the world. But it's such a beautiful world. It is. It's be much more beautiful without you in it. You know, considering our history, I thought maybe you might have something perhaps a little less cliche to contribute. Can we continue, please? Yes, of course. How rude of me. Please. You are here to determine if you're eligible for parole based on past time served. You were tried for four separate terrorist bombings resulting in numerous deaths. Four. I told them it was 15. Well, cops rarely do their due diligence, isn't that right, sergeant? You have been in four fights resulting in the deaths of three inmates. You had your aforementioned encounter with the warden here and pulled out another inmate's eyeball from the socket while he was alive. I guess I needed it. Mr. Chandler, why on earth would we approve you for parole? I found Jesus. Do you think that erases your crime? No. Then why do you deserve parole? Well, because I'm more dangerous inside than I am outside. [music playing] Have you watched the news lately? The world is reaching a boiling point. And keeping revolutionaries such as myself locked up just turns up the heat. You know, I never expected my art to be so broadly accepted by small minds. So I forgive you for that. OH. OK, I think that's enough. I vote his ass stays here. Second. Unanimous. He stays here. Any parting words, Mr. Chandler? Yes. Do you have the time? It's 12:57. You're going to be late to lunch if you don't make this one quick. Looks like we still have a few minutes then. A few minutes before what? Don't listen to this shit. Stop. I'm not done talking. You know, Sergeant. I'm truly sorry. I'm sorry that you spent a decade of your life tracking me down. I am sorry that your wife left you and your kids don't want to see you. And I'm sorry you're such a shitty cop that not even drinking helps you sleep at night. Ouch, Max. [music playing] And you, I'm sorry you do such a horrible job running this place-- should be torn down and turned into a shopping mall. And I'm truly sorry I stabbed you in the neck. What are you wasting our time for, Chandler? Who says I'm wasting anyone's time? [pa announcement] I almost forgot your partner, Williams. Is he still eating all his meals through a tube? [gun shot] What's the time? The time? It's 1:00. [dramatic music] [beeping] [explosion] [dramatic music] I'm done with them. Don't. No! No! No! [gun shots] [music continues] [rap music] Those ain't earthquakes, is it? Nah. That was no earthquake. I can't override it. This is bad. I'm going out. Copy you on your six. Good afternoon, gentlemen. I'm the next shift. [gunfire] Max, you copy? I hear you, Luke. Well done. That's what I do. Time for phase two. Test, test. Test, test. Good afternoon, my fellow inmates. Max Chandler speaking. [grunts] I'm here to inform me that I am now in control of Mount Vernon prison. Ah! And I'm here to offer you a chance to get freedom. You can either choose to stay here under my command until our demands are met, or you are free to go. My men will not stop you. There is no punishment for taking your freedom back. So go, fly, be free. And if you choose to stay here, my demand will now be your demands. And for those of you who are either here visiting loved ones or working here for minimum wage, my men are coming for your phones, and to escort you to the cafeteria where you will be held under gunpoint till this is over. And if any of you try to play hero tonight, you will be executed immediately. [commotion] Aye, this fool series? Guess we'll fucking see. That's Max Chandler, man. Can't follow this crazy son of a bitch. Man, I don't know about this. [commotion] It's like music, isn't it? I need a phone. [sighs] Local news. Associated Foreign Press, FBI. [chuckles] Whom am I forgetting? What are you doing? Making our demands known. [inaudible] invitation. You film me. Come here. Get my best. [clears throat] OK. Ready. Max Chandler here. For those of you that don't know me, I am currently incarcerated in Val Verde State Penitentiary in California for planting and detonating bombs in churches and government buildings 12 years ago. I'm here to tell you that I am now in control of Val Verde prison, and I would like for you to hear the warden's thoughts on this. But he's coming off long shift, and he's dead tired. I'll have that I've granted the other prisoners their freedom. Good luck in finding them. And I can assure you that if my forthcoming demands are not met, then I will destroy the rest of this prison with all the hostages remaining inside. And my demands are simple. Release the six remaining members of the Trier crime family and provide an escort to a country that has no extradition to the United States. Once I receive word of their safety in a helicopter of my own, I will release my control of Val Verde and defuse any remaining bombs that remain on the grounds. You have six hours. Hey, what the hell happened in here? What's going on? What are you doing in here? Smith? Yeah, that's right. Why the fuck are you still in here? We evacuated the building. Hey, man, take it easy. I was in the bathroom when the explosion went off. Hurt my shoulder pretty fucking bad. I didn't hear no evacuation notice. Probably because you were unconscious from the explosions. I wasn't unconscious. Who was that on the intercom? One of the prisoners. He's responsible for all the explosions. No shit. Yeah. Yeah, no shit. OK. Well, look, I need to get out of here. I got to get to the hospital. I hurt my shoulder pretty fucking bad, man. Which is the way out? Just follow me. This way? Yeah, this way. So Smith, you've got family that work in the building? Why do you ask? Just the two guys that checked me in this morning, they were called Smith as well. It's a pretty common last name. I used to hate it when I was a kid. Fuck! [gun shots] [dramatic music] [struggling] Now we heard shots. Smith, status. Yeah, there was a straggler, but I took care of everything. Everything's under control. Good. Hey, don't fuck around next time. Understood. [music playing] [emergency sirens blaring] [police radio chatter] [helicopter whirring] [police radio chatter] I didn't expect to see you here so soon after the incident downtown. Me neither. So what we got? You went briefed? I think, I'm refreshed. Get my [? fear ?] out [? my uniform, ?] yeah? Yeah. Well, we got explosions on the east south wings of the facility. Got the blast covered for now, but not before a few of the prisoners escaped. How many? Handful. Enough to keep the department and Highway Patrol busy. Got a few arrests already, and I'm sure more coming in soon. Who's responsible, huh? Former LAPD bomb squad Max Chandler. Luke! Always good to see you, my friend. How's the family? As well as could be expected. Hmm, what do we have here? New recruits. New recruits. So you chose me over freedom, is that right? Yes, sir. Oh, boy. What's your name? Rico Walker. I'll do anything you ask me to do. Hmm. Anything, huh? Yeah. Mm. [blood gushing] [laughs] What the fuck, Chandler? Any more kiss-asses? Never trust the first motherfucker to speak up, you understand me? Apparently, there's an armory in here to prevent this sort of thing from happening. Does anybody happen to know where it is? Anybody? You do. What's your name? Vincent. Yeah, maybe if you don't kill anyone else, I could lead us all to it. Hmm, interesting. Well it looks like our new friend here will escort you to the armory. So if you're not armed, get armed. Follow me. Can one of the Smiths get up here and pick up three dead bodies? Copy. Nice. [music playing] [inaudible] Oh, my kids do that. Sure. [laughs] Hey, this is Officer Chaz Coleman. Now, it's my understanding that the man who set off the explosives in your prison has also said that you could go free. He's full of shit. Any inmate who was apprehended off of prison grounds will face severe repercussions. Now I understand-- I understand what your demands are. But please know that this is going to take some time. We can't just set prisoners free, do you understand me? [music playing] [gun shots] Welcome to the party, Mr. Coleman. That was one of the prison doctors. It's a bullet to the back of his head. Does that give you an idea the speed I need you working? That definitely does. That definitely does. Thank you. Thank you. [phone ringing] Get it. Yeah. Yeah, I got him right here. It's for you. What? Somebody on the inside. Hostage? I don't think so. OK. Can you anyone one to crack on this? Yeah. Yeah, I'm on it. This is Coleman. Don't give him what he wants. I'm sorry? Who am I speaking to? Don't worry about who I am. Just know you got a friend inside. Well, maybe you don't want to be my friend, huh? You want to send you a picture of the man I just killed? Maybe some other time, you know. I'll have to take your word for it. [chuckles] The man I just killed was wearing a corrections officer uniform. they supposedly moved the hostages to the cafeteria. I've yet to see a single one of them. I'm afraid some of them may have been killed. Who are you? An employee? I'm the janitor. Taking applications? [phone hangs up] Bad joke, huh? Did you get it? We're working on it. All right, we'll get it. Son of a bitch. So I'd kicked that dirty hippie out of my house. That's your place. [? any ?] [? sort, ?] so my girlfriend asked me, so are you fucking somebody behind my back? Yeah. What did you say? I said, yeah. Who the fuck you think it is? Right? Right? [laughs] Dumb bitch. [laughs] Hey, [inaudible] Got to take a piss. You're going to be OK out here? Hurry up, man. [inaudible] flashbacks about the prison showers? That obvious? Without you saying something. Hurry the fuck up, man. Hold up, hold up. I'll be right out. Keep it together. Come on, man. Hurry the fuck up. You need to hold your horses, kid. It takes me a full minute and a half to get this behemoth out of my pants. Something you'd have no idea about. [grunting] [blood gushing] [toilet flushes] Look, kid, I don't want you to get all bent out of shape about what I said about your mom. I was just joking about that. Wasn't being honest. What the fuck? [gun shot] [body drops] [music playing] What's your name, kid? Freddie. OK, Freddie. Listen to me very carefully. Get out of here. Jackpot, motherfuckers. Oh. Now, we're going to fuck some shit up. Woo! Check the shotgun. You take a shotgun. You got a gun. No. Just keeping an eye out. If y'all lead, I'll follow. All right, bro. [inaudible] fucking [inaudible]. Just making sure no one gets the jump on us. You see someone out there, you're going to need that. Thanks but no thanks. Is there a problem? No. Just last time I used one of these is the reason I ended up in here. Well, now it's your ticket out. Yeah, fuck it. Kill this, man. So what are you going to do with your split? Man, I'm gong to work through with this. I don't know about you, but I can sure go for some good floor steak. The hell's a floor steak? Come on, man. That good pussy, that meat between the sheets. Ankles up, always ready. [gun shots] [commotion] Motherfucker! Telling you, he's not going to go for that. Yeah? When the last time someone did? If you can tell me that, then I'll gladly go along with this shit. But until then, stop pulling this shit on me, OK? I'm a 30-year man. I've been doing this shit before you were watching Nick Jr. No luck? I don't think they realize they're going to be responsible for the deaths of an unknown number of civilians if they think that playing by the book is the best option. Going by the book doesn't defuse these situations. Gut instinct does. Only gut instinct does. Yeah, I hear that. Right. I need an update. Jenner, hey. Nothing yet. Nothing yet, but I need a little bit more time. [gun shots] That's another hostage death because of your negligence. I hope that helps you take me more seriously. It certainly does. And my transportation? En route. Military escort? Working on it. In progress. [interposing voices] [police radio chatter] Woo! It's our prison now, bitches! Our prison now! Woo! Is that you little, bitch? Fuck you! [inaudible] motherfuckers. Take a ball out of China or some shit? Let's fucking do this shit, man. [voices echoing] Fuck you. [inaudible] motherfucker. Come on, where you going, man? Vincent, where you fucking going to the gym? Chase, you guys clear the hallways. I'll meet you on the West Wing. Come on. Let's have some fun boys. Woo! We got to make it to cell block six, you know what I'm talking about? Yeah! [inaudible] you hear me motherfucker. What you doing so far ahead of me? Don t fucking call me... (indist Fuck you doing, man? Let's have some fun! [whistles] Hey, what the fuck was that? [whistling] [tense music] [grenade clicks] Get the fuck down the hallway. [machine gun fire] [action music] [knife unsheathes] The fuck is going on, [? nuovo? ?] Oh! [slashing sound] [body thuds] [punches exchanging] [grunts] [stabbing sound] [eerie music] [tense music] New recruits? Where are the bodies? Bodies? The bodies. You told the negotiator you're executing hostages. I did. You're right. But I guess you're not. Ruke, would you take the men out and do the rounds? Copy that. [footsteps] Come on. Let me see. You see these people are willfully ignorant. They don't understand how things play out in the real world. What people? Those that are not enlightened. Did you know 90% of humanity won't cry for help until the ship is sinking? They're like pigs to the slaughter. As long as it means their bubbles of self-delusion aren't [? popped ?] [? then ?] they can die peacefully believing whatever bullshit they spent their entire lives filling their heads with. So what's your point? Point? Yeah, is there a greater point? A method to your madness? You know, I used to be a cop, bomb squad. No. You know, I'm in here for blowing up churches and government buildings. Why would I do that? To make a statement? To make a statement. You are smarter than I thought you were. I was tired of seeing all the bullshit and I knew I had to do something. Did you kill innocent people? Hmm, see, my definition of innocence is different than others. And do you know why they can only get me with four charges? You got me? Because I was told I almost had a hung jury. You see, my lawyer had a way of convincing the jurors to see my side of the argument. You see, people need to get punished so I took away their meaning of life. Their churches, their financial institutions, these things that they believe give their life meaning. I hear you. Who are these people you asked to be released? [chuckles] I don't know. Ruke gave me their names based off their confessions. You see, if you give law enforcement a large enough task, they will bury themselves in it before they realize they've been duped. Do you understand? Yes, I do. You're too smart to be in here. [panting] Somebody just killed two of us. Who? I didn't get a good look at him, man. Fucking smoke grenade. He wasn't dressed like no cop. Bomber? [radio crackling] Cruz? We got a problem. Someone is clearly not playing by the rules. [police siren] Chandler, hey. Hey, can you to fill me in? Someone is killing my men. I gave a warning in my initial announcement. Nobody comes in, nobody plays hero today. [gunshots] Shit. [tires screeching] [cellphone vibrates] [dialing] [phone ringing] Who is it? Alex? Alex? How'd you get the name? Ah, the same way I figured out, you know, the janitor. Listen, I've already told you guys I'm on your side. We know that. Look, we need you out. You've made your presence known and Chandler has begun executing hostages. You know, I'm not sure about that. Why? Well, I've seen more than half of this damn place and I haven't seen a single hostage. And I've got to tell you, I've got a bad feeling. Well, let's hope you're wrong, OK? Listen, you've got to do me another favor. What's that? OK. The prison inmates that were released, any go by the name of Vincent Barros? Vincent Barros? No. OK. I'm assuming you already know that's my son. That means he's still here. In all likelihood, yes. [cuts call] Vinny. I don't know what's going on. [breathing heavily] There is a snake in the henhouse. There is someone in here stealing your freedom. Killing your friends. It is not a cop. I know cops. Special forces, it's the only kind of person to be able to stay undetected this long. So what do we get if we take him down? Oh, you want a reward? Someone's out there taking us out. It's only right if we get more money. OK, fine. $1 million to whoever brings me that motherfucker. Dead. Let's go. [footsteps] Yes, sir. Bring him to me. [gun cocking] [tense music] [eerie music] [cellphone ringing] Oh. Hey. I found the hostages. I don't like that tone. I know that tone. They're all dead, right? Yeah, every one of them. Every single one of them. [sighs] Ah, shit. Hmm, that felt good. Might as well get in the may day [screams] [stabbing sounds] You let me go. You let me go. [chuckles] Let me go. You need to try harder. Let me show you what a stabbing looks like. [gunshots] [grunts] [heavy breathing] [screams] [heavy breathing] OK. Come on. [tense music] [dial tone] [cellphone ringing] Alex? [chuckles] [chuckles] Chandler. That's right. I figured I'd keep this one just between friends. Yeah, well, since we're friends, I guess you should know. I-- I know your little secret. Oh, what's that? Oh, come on. The hostages, they're already dead. Let me guess, your little friend on the inside, what's his name, Alex? Did he tell you that? Is that right? That's right. And how do you know it wasn't your friend? Because I know his type and you should too. I mean, it used to be a cop, right? I can't get anything past you, John. So where does that leave us? Well, this gets to the higher-ups and SWAT comes and then wipes floor with your stupid ass. That's about it. Unless you didn't tell them. You didn't, did you? No. You really have a lot of faith in your friend Alex, don't you? I do. So where does this leave us now? You're still working on your friends. Chopper's en route. I can't promise transportation to anywhere other than Mexico. And once you make it there, you're on your own. You won't be protected. Yeah. Win some, you lose some. [tense music] [deep breath] [door opens] [gunshots] [bullet ricochets] [gunshots] Vinny? Dad, what the fuck? I should have fucking known it was you. What does that mean? You stayed behind. I wanted to stay behind. I was in the bathroom when the bomb went off. Yeah, and then you went into old ways, picking our guys off one by one like it's a fucking wraith. I thought you only killed people for a paycheck. Now's not the time for that. Now what did you say, our guys? Yeah, our guys. Oh, Vinny. Come on, man. What are you-- what are you thinking? What are you doing? It's not the way. Max makes perfect sense. And he's one of the few people I've ever met who knows how fucked up the world really is. Trust me, Vinny, there's a lot of people who feel the same way. Yeah, but they don't do a damn thing about it, do they? Listen to your father. I've been there, OK? I've seen some horrible things. I've seen fucked up. And I've also seen things worth fighting for. And I'm telling you, this ain't one of them. You fight for a cause? Well, so do I. We're more similar than I ever would have hoped. But what you did was legal. Vinny, this is real life we're talking about. If you decide to leave here with Max, you'll be shot on sight. Yeah, why's that? Why do you think? If only you knew the fucking truth. You're the only one here who's killing anybody. Oh, Jesus, Vinny. It's true. You're the only one killing anybody. Max hasn't fucking touched the hostages. That's not true, Vinny. Yes, it is. It's what he wants you to think. That whole PA, execution shit, that's bullshit. You should know that. Shh. Vinny, the hostages are dead. Shut up. The hostages are dead. Don't try to fucking lie to me. I'm not lying to you. Stop being so fucking naive. Take a look at yourself. Don't you-- Look where you are. Just stop being so fucking naive, OK? That's what I used to tell your mother. She used to listen everybody. Talking about my mother! Well, I'm trying to tell you, you don't make the same mistakes, OK? What are you-- What kind of fucking mistakes? You're the only one making a mistake here. Vinny, you're doing the stupidest thing you could do, so stop being naive and stop being like your mom. Like my mom? Listen to me. Tell me more about my mom then, huh? As if you fucking knew her like me. Vinny. You don't even know me. Stop it. You're being stupid, OK? I'm not going to tell you again. Your decision, what are you going to do? Think about it. Come on, what are you going to do? Fucking hate you, yo. But I'm not going to kill you. [gunshot] Get the fuck out of here while you can. All right, dad? Oh, Jesus. Get the fuck out of here. [radio chatter] One for you. You wanna talk to it? Yeah. [radio chatter] What? [? sir, ?] I don't know. Nothing. Don't worry about it. [chuckles] [? gnp ?] on EMT. Don't worry about it. [eerie music] [grunts] [breathing heavily] [? get me ?] [? through to that ?] [? voice. ?] Come on. [grunts] [grunts] [scalpel drops] [heavy breathing] [grunts] [screams] [panting] [screams] [panting] [grunts] Oh. Rhino? Rhino? [radio static] Rhino, come in. Uh, Rhino, no, he ain't come back. Alex, nice to meet you. Can't say I feel the same way. You've killed quite a few of my men today. They had it coming. An unfortunate side-effect of progress. You spend enough time and a place like this you'd understand, but you wouldn't get that, would you? Believe me, I would. [grunts] Where did you do your time? Marawi City, Philippines. We flew into expected Congressman's plane went down and I lost my whole unit. Ended up in some POW camp. I had to fight my own way out because the government wouldn't come to terms. And so good news is, got an honorable discharge. But the pension pays about as much as a fast food manager, so I'm fine. I'm good. I made a career in the LAPD. Had one bad session with the staff psychiatrist and I got put on leave with a severance where I couldn't even afford a studio in South Central LA. But I found my higher calling. Yeah, I remember your name. Ex-hero cop who turned Unabomber. But I got to tell you something, Max. I'm not sure a bad psych evaluation is worth killing all these innocent people, you get me? Oh, I only killed people who were responsible for the social and economic downfall of this nation. I sympathize with you on that one, pal. You give your life to a cause then they spit in your face. For no reason. Other than that, no use for you in one way whatsoever. Your particular case, Max, I think it's time maybe you cash it in. Call it in or call it a day, pal. Maybe they'll look after you. They only kept me alive because I've been leaking Intel to the FBI. You know, after today, I don't think they'll have any use for me, kind of like the LAPD after I divulged my feelings. No, it's-- it's too late for me, Alex. I hear you. Then let's make a deal. If it's a cop that's going to take you out, go with me. I'll make sure it's me first. You know there's one thing that we forgot to discuss. Yeah, what's that? Well, you're not a cop. You're not a corrections officer. So who are you? I'm the janitor. [chuckles] Bullshit. You wouldn't be here right now unless you were trying to get somebody out. [tense music] [grunts] [breathing heavily] [numbers dialing] Which one is this, huh? This is me too, Alex. Hey, thank God for that. Alex, hey. They have my son. What? He was a hostage? No, no, no, he's not a hostage. Somehow Max convinced him to join the team. OK, listen, man. There's a helicopter coming right now and he thinks it's going to take him to the border. The thing is, he doesn't know that my superiors are aware he's executed the hostages already. So once the helicopter takes off, Chandler's dead. And then SWAT's gonna go in there and take out the rest of his team. And that's it. Did you hear me, Alex? No, wait, what-- wait, wait. Don't let them kill my son. Look, I'm afraid it's out of my hands at this point. It's out of my hands at this point. How long do I have? Not long. Minutes. That's all I need. [tense music] [side conversation] Stay frostie. It's getting done. He's going to smile. All right, gentlemen? That's what I'm here for now, buddy. You like the sound of that? [chuckles] A well-earned rest. Well, especially after our last. Oh. Right? Yeah, stuff is harder than that. That go his way? [chuckling] [interposing voices] [breathing heavily] ...just that nice long vacation. Aww, man. I got that new girl I'm gonna take. There you go. Money well spent, I hope. Yeah. All it does is cost more. Spend wisely. [laughter] Not tonight. No exhume. Back to the job stuff. You're a smarter man than me. Nah. It's wise to hold down, right? Let's do it. Yeah. Spend a nice long vacation. Aww, yeah. Get that girl in there. There you go. Hey. [silenced gunshots] [screams] [breathing heavily] [gunshots] [grunts] [breathing heavily] [metal banging] [gunshots] [grunts] [tense music] [breathing heavily] [music playing] [gunshots] [gunshots] [groaning] [groaning] [gunshots] [music playing] [gunshot] [gunshot] [groaning] [gunshots] [gunshots] Moment. Take Delta at three... [inaudible] Remember [inaudible] shoot on [inaudible].. Wow. You're the snake. I hate snakes. [punching] It's all good. I can do this all day. Are you ready? Yeah. [laughs] [punching] [groaning] It's disappointing. I bet you were a bad dude back in the day. And now, you're old. You're tired. What are you anyway, hm? Army? Special forces? Navy SEAL? No, no, no. I know what you are. The only way you could have creeped around all day picking us off one by one. You're a rough fucking ninja. [laughter] Black Ops. I know the type. I think someone like you will be used to the pain. I spent weeks in a Taliban camp in Afghanistan being waterboarded. I thought for sure I was dead at one point. Then, the goddamn American army came in guns blazing. Turns out the British patrol missed me by barely 50 feet. Those motherfuckers just didn't look hard enough. That's when I knew guys like Max had it right. We're all expendable to those in charge. And the only way you get them to listen is to light a fire and watch them run. [laughs] Yeah. [groaning] Hm. Fighting to the end, huh? It seems like you've been around. [laughs] OK. Now, let me take you somewhere that you haven't been. Let's do it. Yeah. [punching] [groaning] [punching] [groaning] [punch] [choking] [spitting] [music playing] [phone buzzing] [phone beeps] Your ride's here. Be on the move in five minutes, not six. Five. Good. Five minutes. What about the others? They're not going to make it. Let's go. What do you mean they're not going to make it? I mean they're not going to make it. Is there a problem? Are you coming? If you are, you probably want to leave the gun here. They will shoot you on site. Problem? No. Good. Let's go. [thud] [music playing] Ha! Right on time. Oh, I should learn to trust my instincts. He's here for you, isn't he? [helicopter whirring] [sirens] Who is he? Huh? Your brother? Your uncle? Your cousin? Who is he? He's my father. He's your father? [laughs] I should have known that. I don't care about him. I don't even fucking like him. Let's test that theory. How about when he comes up here, you take this gun, and you point it at him? You can put a bullet in his head. How do you know I'm not going to point it at you? Oh, I don't. Let's play a little game. Let's find out. You want it? Take it. Take it. [inaudible], kid. Take the gun. Fuck off. Take the gun. Point it at me. That's right. It feels good in your hand, huh? Now, all you've got to do is point it at me and pull the fucking trigger. You're in control of your own fucking destiny. Do you want to be with me? Do you want to be with your dad? Do you want to be with yourself? What do you want? Point it at me. [police sirens] That's it. Higher. Point the gun at my face. Pull the trigger. That's right. You can do it. That's right. That's right. [helicopter whirring] It's hard to hold it still with a helicopter up above you, isn't it? See, now that is control. Do it. Pull the trigger. Shut up! [screaming] You have an amazing new life ahead of you. I'm proud of you. Let's go. Alex! Dad. You come to see us off? Nope. Vincent, are you OK? Good. You? Yeah, I'm good. Come here, son. Come. [gunshots] [groaning] Dad! No, no, no, no, no. Dad. Dad. Dad, where are you hit? Where are you hit? [inaudible] Come on. I got you. I got you. I'm good, Vinny. Took my right arm. Lift the gun. Lift the gun. OK. Lift the gun. OK. [helicopter whirring] [gunshot] [panting] Do it. [music playing] Finish it. [helicopter whirring] I'm tired. [helicopter whirring] [music playing] Oh, my son. You know, you have grown big like your grandfather. He was a big man. I'm sorry for shooting you. That's OK, son. I think I deserved that one. [helicopter whirring] [music playing] Come on. Take me home. Come on. Let's go. I got one problem. You've been looking at me, and I don't like that. Get your old man to a hospital, kid.
