I guess when you consider it, life is... life is chance. A bunch of moments stuck together. Could have gone one way or another. But in the end, they went the way they did. I guess the only way they could. And I don't think there's anything that me or anyone else could have done to change that. Tell me I won't. - Tell me I won't. - You won't. And I guess that's where we'll begin. No, you won't! So, when am I seeing you again? What makes you think I want to see you again? Oh, okay. No, for real, though, I would like to see you again.

And if it don't come out, which it never does, turn it-- Am I staying back there in the spare room? -Pardon? -In the spare room? Yeah. -I can stay there? -Yeah. All right. All right, I'm not a weakling. I am a strong person out here on the street. And there's a lot of very, very nice people here. - Yeah. - In Tampa. And all joking aside, it rains a lot here. Mmm. During rainy season, and I know hurricane season is coming and, you know-- Mm-hmm.Gotta bunker down, man. - Yeah. - Look at me. - Yeah. - I'm a hairy man. I can take-- I could take the rain without-- without a shirt. When you-- When you're a gorilla, you can take-- Yeah. And-- and I am a gorilla. You have beautiful eyes. They're really cool colors.
