My dad lives in Cuernavaca, sometimes he comes to visit me. Do you have his number? Any other relatives? I have an aunt in Canada. - Where's my dad? - He couldn't come. Your family sent for you, go with him. You can't stay here. Please. MEXICO CITY COME BACK SOON Don't you remember me? Dad! Hi. Don't you know who I am? Haven't they told you about your grandmother? Is my dad here? He's away. But he'll soon be here, don't worry. You'll sleep in this one, the other one's your dad's. Look, here are some clothes from when your dad was your age. They're a bit old, but you can wear them if you want. It fits perfectly. Everything will be all right. You need a lot of rest. Tell me about the stick up. You were there, weren't you? It's a miracle nothing happened to you. - Will my mom be okay? - Of course, I'm sure she will. Dhely, don't be rude and talk to the boy... ...tell him about your kittens. Yes, Mom. Andy, I have lots... ...of kittens. And what are their names? Bruno, Chanito... Cu... ...Cumbancha. Cumbancha, very well, Dhely. Very well, darling. Yes, Mommy. Mom! Come on sweetie, time for breakfast. These gadgets aren't good. Give it to me. It's confiscated, I'll give it to you when you leave. Come on, let's have breakfast. The boss wants you to put him to work to keep him busy. Come this way, you'll learn something. I'm not going to hurt you. I know what happened to you, it's okay. Look, I'm sure your mom will get better soon, you'll see. Let's get to work. You have to stick the trowel under these tiny plants, they're weed. Stick it all the way in... ...and pull it out, root and all. Now you do it. Well done, kiddo, you're not that stupid. Do these and I'll do all those back there. Look at you my baby. Andy, come. This is where I cure them. These are my costumes. Here goes my special power, rays strike you! I am a witch! Dhely, no cats inside the house. Sit, children. Sorry, Mom. Are we having supper? No, we're not having supper. Andy... I think it's better for you to know. Your mom is dead. The lord is the stronghold of my life; Of whom shall I be afraid? One thing have I asked of the Lord, that I will seek after: That I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life... ...to gaze upon the beauty of The Lord, and to inquire in his temple. For he will hide me in his shelter; in the day of trouble... he will conceal me under the cover of his tent; he will lift me high upon a rock. And now my head shall be lifted up above my enemies all around me... Andy... Your grandmother and I decided... ...it's best if you come to live in Canada with me. Take me to Cuernavaca with my dad! Andy, you'd better go with your aunt. No! You'll stay with us... ...while your aunt does the paperwork to take you to Canada. Why didn't my dad come? Really, he'll come home soon. Don't worry! Dhely, don't play with your food. I'm not hungry. Eat as much as you can, leave the rest, don't play with food. I want to go to my room. Go ahead Andy, it's all right. Good night. ANDRES (SON) Please leave a message... Please leave a message... CALLING Your credit has expired. - Are you okay? - Yes. All right, go to sleep. You need to get a lot of rest. May I have a kiss? I know what you're going through, Andy, I've been there. I can help you. Do you know how to punish the bad guys? Don't think about that. My dad will know how. Where do you call my dad? To his cell phone, he travels so much. When was the last time you called him? Last night. Why the third degree? You sound like a detective. I told you, he'll be back soon. Hey, kiddo. Hey, Andy. Are you okay? Come, let's go. Come. You can't just lie here, in the dark. Come on sweetie, get up, come on! What city is my dad in? I don't know, he travels so much. Come on, get dressed. As of tomorrow, you'll help us make jam. It's been the best therapy for me. She says she loves you. Come. I can make it on my own, Mom. BATTERY NEEDS CHARGE - Something else will turn up. - Hope so. - Take care. - We'll keep in touch. Where are you going? It's dangerous outside! Making jam will keep you busy. This is where we make the jams. I brought the machines myself, from Germany. That's why my jams are the best in Cuernavaca. Guys, from now on, Andy will help us harvest. Mommy, can I come in? Go away! Well, okay, everyone get to work. We have to fill the buckets with guavas. Look, these are the good ones, the ripe ones. Oh, that's pretty. Look, this is the right color. Hey! - What's with you? - It fell! Hey, what's up, kiddo? Are you coming with me? Don't listen to him Andy, he's just bothering us. This is it. It isn't that hard. See? Now you. I don't know. You can do it, come on. One, two, three. The girl I like, her name is Poison. Well, that's what they call her. She's really pretty. What? You like girls, don't you? Yes. Come on, I'll show you a great place, it'll cheer you up. Jump. This is how we open it. This is the jungle. Your grandmother doesn't like us coming here, but I love it. I come when I feel sad. You can see my house from down there. This is really cool! That's where I live. Look, that's my gang, the girl is Poison. I can see you, your jacket is nice. Guess who? I'm looking at you. I'm your conscience. Help me make a cell phone work. What cell phone? It's really cheap, where did you get this? It's my dad's. Thanks Andy, I love guavas. Oh! Here comes the bad guy. So will you help me with the phone? I don't like that loon, why do you hang out with her? She's nice. Come on, help me with the phone. I have to take it with me to check it. Stay with her, ask her for help. How did the harvest go? Fine. When Grandpa died, I felt the same way. But focusing on work, it faded away. Did you also tell that to my dad on the phone? What do you mean? Andy, Chanito does love you. Stop it, Dhely. Go with Esmeralda or with the Icon. Please help me. You didn't let me take it to check it, I can't help you. I can't find the charger. Your old man must've lost it, he keeps losing things. Let me see. - What do you want it for? - It has messages to my dad. - They're no use to you. - They can tell me where he is. If you want to listen to them, give me money for a phone card. And extra money for a charger. No, don't take it. Who'd want it? You have to give me at least five hundred. - Where would I get it from? - From your grandma. Look. Go away! What are you doing here? Go to sleep! - Can I have some money? - Go to bed! Where's my grandma? She isn't feeling well this morning, sit down and have breakfast. Esmeralda, girl, come! Take the boss her aspirin. I'll be right back. What? Go away! Poison is playing hard to get. She wants me to quit the gang. You're two-hundred short. Just kidding! I'll have your phone working by tomorrow. When my dad comes, he'll take us far away from here. Us? Besides, it's a beautiful place, though it's a long ride. Shut up, girl, come, learn how to defend yourself. I'll teach you. Defend yourself! Really? No. Check this out. Guard up, double punch. An upper jab, another. Come on, girl, like I told you. Like I told you, double. Another one, upper. That's it, great. Put them in there. You're all stupid. You're stupid. What are you doing? Charly, put your shirt on and go home. - Can you pay me for the harvest? - We'll talk this week. And you, go to your room! - Dhely, come! - Yes, Mom. Why did you take money from my purse? I didn't do it. Dhely saw you. I'm missing some money. - It's not true. - You're a thief, like your father. That's how he started and ended up in jail, now you? My dad is in jail? No, not anymore, but he's never taken care of you. Give me back my money or you'll be grounded until you leave. Charm! We're going to mass, and if you repent, I'll buy clothes for you. Just as messy as your father. Did you pray for your mother? Yes. Are you sorry you stole from me? - I want bubbles, Mom. - Yes, darling. - Here, your allowance. - Yes, Mommy. You're not getting any, you didn't give me back what you took. - Carmencita, how are you? - Hi Blanca. Fine, and you? Fine, but a bit tired, our neighbors won't let me sleep. - Yes, they're terrible. - Terrible. - Don't go, Andy! - I'll be right back! Don't take long and don't stray too far! Tickets, please! Pay with this also thems, and thems. I'll give your chage right away. Make it spin! - Hey. - Give these to the gang. Here you have. Want some? What about my card and charger? - Not yet, later. - I want some cotton candy. I don't have enough. Blanca, we're off now. We'll have breakfast and find a solution. - Yes. - We're all tired of those people. All of us. - Have a lovely Sunday. - Thanks. - Goodbye. - Bye. Andy, we're leaving! - Please. - Where are you? Let's gm. Coming! My purse! My purse! He just stole it! Thief, he stole my purse! I forbid you from seeing Charly! - It wasn't him. - It wasn't? You're a terrible liar, your father's criminal genes! - To the restaurant, ma'am? - No, home! Charly can't step foot in my house again! Get it? Yes, ma'am. - I'm hungry, Mom. - We'll be home soon, darling. What is it, Delfino? Don't look. We can't take it any longer. Cuernavaca isn't what it used to be. Come for breakfast with Blanca, we must do something. They're right next door, it's madness. Fine, see you tomorrow. Don't fire Charly, let him come back. That topic is closed forever. Can I sleep with Chanito? He's sick. No Dhely, you know you can't. Yes. Yes, Mom. Help me, before the women come. Look, these are really ripe. Andy, help me get down! Charm! Charm! Kiddo, what are you doing here? Come in. What, can you tell I'm working out? - What's up, girl? - Cut it out! What? Do as I taught you. You're a sissy. Do you have the card and the charger? I ran out of money. That's not all, the gang doesn't want me near them. They say I'm an idiot. Well, enjoy. Please Charly, help me with the phone. Don't worry, I'll have it all tomorrow. I'll give it to you at the river. Stop whining. Here you go, blondie. Hey, kid. Wait. Look, it's not that I don't want to help you... ...but since I can't go inside the house, everything's harder. You know. Do you promise you'll help me? Yes, the problem is that damn old woman. We're both screwed. Yeah, damn old woman. Thank you Carmencita, they look delicious. I'm glad you like them, we make them with all the love in the world. My husband loves them, he says they're the best jams in Cuernavaca. They are. Okay, what should we do about the neighbors? My husband says they're drug dealers. - I can not talk to governor's wife. - Yes, talk to her. They might be involved with the dealers too. How did the cats get in? What's going on? Rosa, Delfino, get these cats out of here! Andy, get over here! I won't take any more nonsense from you! Next time I'll send you to your aunt in Canada! You can't, I'll go with my dad. Your dad won't come, he doesn't love you. Go to sleep. I'm glad you came. Thanks a lot. Now you have to help me for the gang to take me back. Yes, of course. Help me break into the house. - Promise you'll do it. - I promise. Thank you for increasing your balance. You can make calls now. - Are you all right? - Coming! All the guavas you harvested need to be peeled. I'll tell you how, this is one of my secrets. We boil the fruit without the skin. Pay attention! Come here. Esmeralda, teach him how to peel them. Careful he doesn't cut himself. Yes. Look, it's easier this way. There are many ways to peel them, like this... - I'm going to the bathroom. - Don't take long, we have to finish.
