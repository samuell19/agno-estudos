ROBERT: We had no sibling rivalry when it came to writing. I didn't pull away from him, he pulled away from me. The hardest part was... I don't want, I... I don't know... We've perpetrated a facade for 50 years. I'm Gregg Sherman. I'm Dick's son. I'm Bob Sherman's son, Jeff. JEFF: I met my cousin, Gregg, four years ago at a Sherman Brothers' event. It was the opening of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang in 2002. His family was sitting all the way to one side of the theater, and my family was sitting all the way to the other side of the theater. GREGG: After the performance, Jeff and I spoke all night. It was the first time we'd talked in almost 40 years. JEFF: I never saw him. I never talked to him, and we live seven blocks apart. Here were two men that devoted their careers to writing family entertainment music, and yet neither one of them could get their families together. JEFF: My father and his brother Dick worked closely together for over 50 years, yet there was a lot of animosity between the two brothers. GREGG: And I was told, &quot;When you're older, you'll understand. &quot;It's better this way.&quot; And I got older, and I still had no idea why. JEFF: So we tried to figure it out. Bob and I are two and a half years, and about 5 eons apart. (CHUCKLING) We are different people. JEFF: Dad, since you moved to London, do you miss Los Angeles? I don't miss it at all. (LAUGHING) I really don't. RICHARD: The funny thing about brothers... You don't forget that relationship no matter how old you get. I'm still the kid brother. JEFF: I'm gonna ask basic questions to start, okay? How's the sound? Can you hear him? Okay, good. Hi, Dad. Howdy. Good to see you. Good morning. Good morning. You ready to tak. How you doing? ...journey backwards? This is gonna be wonderful. RICHARD: I've never set foot inside the house since 1940. We had a company called The Alley Productions. That was when we were little boys. We got bawled out by the folks because we had taken this newly painted garage. ROBERT: We had a pot full of blue paint, and we wrote &quot;Alley Productions,&quot; and it dripped. We had two sawhorses, planks, and we used to put up plays. RICHARD: Bob was the director, producer, writer, and I was the performer. I would be the star. One thing I wrote was Avaron. He was a strange guy from outer space. &quot;I am Avaron, the soul searcher, &quot;looking for an honest soul.&quot; Bob did not approve when I did my own variations. He did whatever he wanted to do. The kids would just sit on the ground here or... No, no, no. We had stools for them. This was a high class operation. JEFF: Was there any business aspect to The Alley Playhouse? We used to charge one or two cents. Dick let all his friends in, and they didn't have pennies. He'd let them in anyway. RICHARD: Bob didn't like that. He said, &quot;No, they gotta pay to see the show.&quot; And Mom and Dad would always stand at the back like this, watching us. And they never made us un-paint the door. We were a very close-knit family, though. We used to have a slogan, &quot;Always together, always one.&quot; They loved me. They loved him. I was Bobby-boy, he was Dicky-boy. ROBERT: Dad was a tremendous kite maker, and he used to take us out on weekends and buy string and buy paper and mucilage, and he'd make these marvelous kites that'd fly forever. Kids would gather around, and he'd give them kites. He mended it! It's wonderful! How ever did you manage it? ♪ With tuppence for paper and strings ♪ You can have your own set of wings ♪ With your feet on the ground ♪ You're a bird in flight ♪ With your fist holding tight ♪ To the string of your kite ♪ Oh! ♪ Let's go fly a kite ♪ On Sundays, Grandpa Al would come to the house, and he'd give me a piano lesson. When the wind would start blowing, he'd sort of point to the door, and I and my whole family would run across the street to this little round park, and we'd make and fly kites. And I remember in the early days, Gregg's family and my family would do this all together, and those were great times. RICHARD: My father was born in a little town outside of Kiev, and in the year 1909, the Sherman family immigrated from the old country to America. JEFF: As a young man, Grandpa Al got a job as a mood music pianist for silent motion pictures at Biograph Studios in the Bronx. That's where he met Rose Dancis. ♪ It's hard to see a needle in a haystack My mother, she was an actress, and she was in silent films. She was a lovely lady. ♪ That I'm crazy over you ♪ OSBORNE: Music and the entire show business was really centered in New York City. The Brill Building and Tin Pan Alley, that's where all the songwriters gathered and plugged their records and got record deals. Al Sherman was the Tin Pan Alley songwriter. (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) You had to be at the top of your game because if you didn't get the job, somebody else would win it. Well, sorry. I've gotta have something with snap. JEFF: Al had his first big hits composing bright, optimistic songs during the Great Depression. Many were recorded by vaudeville stars who were moving into the talkies. Al Jolson, Helen Kane, Rudy Vallee and Eddie Cantor. And my dad, Jerry Stiller, would go around doing... ♪ Potatoes are cheaper, tomatoes are... ♪ I don't even know what this means, but apparently Eddie Cantor did this. (STILLER LAUGHING) ♪ Now's the time to fall in love ♪ Now's the time to fall in love ♪ What we recognize as the American sound, so much of it came from people like Aaron Copland or George Gershwin. Similarly, Al Sherman. Who interestingly enough, all three of them were first generation children of immigrant Russian Jews. Probably the least likely people you could imagine that were able to manufacture what we all recognize as being quintessentially American. It's kind of a... In the history of music, it's a miracle. ♪ Save your sorrow ♪ RICHARD: During the '30s, there was a tremendous migration of pop songwriters that were coming out to Hollywood. And Dad was hired. Somebody wanted him. We drove to California in an old Chevy. RICHARD: It was a long, tedious trip out to California. I remember the... We had no air conditioning at the time, so it was blistering hot. Just about the day he arrived in California, the executive that had hired him died, so here he was with his children and his wife and no job. But even though we were going through tough times, Dad always wrote optimistic songs. ♪ I'm so happy! Happy-go-lucky me! ♪ I just go my way, living every day! The fortunes of a songwriter was such that we had to move often and I had to change friends, go to different schools. Terrible thing. There's no paycheck at the end of the week. It was just... Maybe you'll have some song that makes some money or not. ♪ Living in the sunlight, loving in the moonlight ♪ Having a wonderful time! ♪ (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) I met Bobby in the... At El Rodeo School. He was extremely observant, this impression of shy, kind of very interesting eyes that always were very alert and watching. ROBERT: Sammy, he used to come to my house. We spent a lot of time together. He's my best friend. SAM: I remember my father once saying to me, &quot;Friends, friends. You're very lucky if you got one friend, &quot;and you happen to be very fortunate with that Sherman boy.&quot; (LAUGHING) I remember Bob was very proud of his father, and the first thing he did was to explain, well, he wrote a song. I said, &quot;What was the song?&quot; And he said... ♪ You gotta be a football hero ♪ To get along with the beautiful girls ♪ You've gotta be a football hero ♪ To get along with the beautiful girls ♪ JEFF: Now, you and Dick as kids, um, were you close? Not really. We were never close as kids. Didn't know him that well. We adored each other. I mean, I looked up to Bob. He was my hero. ROBERT: When I grew up, I wanted to be a writer. Novels and plays. I used to write poetry. About everything. Mother's Day, Father's Day, birthdays, weekdays. Bob could recite a poem, and everybody'd say, &quot;Oh, isn't Bobby wonderful? He's wonderful.&quot; And Dicky was sitting there being a dweeb. This was a very large cedar closet that was Bob's dark room, and heads would roll if you went in there when he was working because it destroyed his... He'd go in here with Sam Goldwyn? Yeah, they, Bob... Bob and Sammy used to work in there all the time. GREGG: And who was in this? Well, let me see. I don't... (THUDDING) (ALL LAUGHING) I'm up to my old tricks. You see that roof? GREGG: Yeah. There was like an open area here. I would jump off the roof on... Just to create the illusion that I could fly. I certainly did weird things like that. I used to jump out of trees a lot. JEFF: You got your accolades through your achievements. How did he get attention? He had asthma. (LAUGHING) JEFF: He ended up in military school. How did that come about? Well, there's various versions. I think he tried to burn the school down. I didn't burn down the school! (MEN LAUGHING) I was playing with matches. I mean, that's not the same thing. JEFF: Did it change him? He had a nice uniform. ♪ There's a job to do, there's a fight to win ♪ Follow me, boys, follow me ♪ We were in the war, and I wanted to go and kill the Germans. I prevailed upon my parents. They finally signed the permission, so at 17, I enlisted in the Army. JEFF: So you went overseas. Where did you go? Oh, from France to Belgium, to Holland and Luxembourg, finally to Germany. Well, we were taking a little town called Bredenbeck. The captain says, &quot;Six minutes and we'll charge.&quot; And we're shooting... And as I was crossing a field, I got hung up on some barbed wire, and by the time I untangled myself, a machine pellet hit me in the knee, and, uh, so I shall remember it for a while. He was really in bad shape when I saw him after the war. Really, it was very upsetting. I couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe the shape he was in, and I was worried he wasn't gonna live very long. The pain was just killing him, and look what a survivor he is. I had just graduated from high school, and Bob had gotten out of the Army. ROBERT: And I wrote some short stories, typed them up, sent them out to about 12 different magazines. One day on the hospital ward, they said, &quot;There's a telephone call for you.&quot; This is Grace Fischler from Coronet magazine. She said, &quot;Well, we're gonna publish your stories, one every month.&quot; She said, &quot;Henceforth, anything else you write, I'd like to see first.&quot; I said, &quot;I'd never met a person who used the word 'henceforth.'&quot; (LAUGHING) We were both gonna go to Bard College, New York State, and I had to declare a major for myself. Bob wanted to go into literature. He knew that. I was all of 17, in a terrible, terrible depression, and I decided to take a walk, and as I walked, I was hearing music, and I was wondering, &quot;Where is this music coming from?&quot; And I realized it was coming from my own head. So I darted back to the apartment where we had a little piano and started picking it out on the piano, this feeling I had. I'd never done that before, never. And my father said, &quot;What are you doing here? What is this?&quot; I said, &quot;Well, this is something I felt.&quot; I just... I had to say it. This is what I feel. He says, &quot;You're gonna be a music major.&quot; That's when it happened. (PIANO PLAYING) RICHARD: Because of the war, Bob and I both entered Bard College at the same time. He was a war veteran, you know, and I was just a wet-behind-the-ears kid. The two and a half years that we were separated by years became 10 years because he had lived so much more than I had. ROBERT: I looked at things a lot differently, so he went with his friends, I went with mine. We didn't speak much to each other. That's the way it went. GREGG: Would you go home for, like, Christmas break or anything? I stayed at school, and it was boring 'cause nobody was there. Dick had a girlfriend, and he went to their home. RICHARD: It was kind of a childhood romance, you know, that type of thing. We sort of got married. That's one of those things that we did. It was a mistake, but a beautiful thing happened. We had a little girl named Lynda, whom we both adored. After school, reality hit us. We came back to California, and all of a sudden I had to make a living. My grandfather had a very well-established dry cleaning business, and he wanted Dad to go into the business because he knew it could support his wife and child. RICHARD: It was kind of terrifying because I wanted to be a songwriter more than anything in the world. I'd rather do that than breathe. It would be a very unhappy marriage to keep going like this, and it had to end. And I had my clothing and a few articles that I owned at the little apartment that I shared with my first wife. Uh... I needed help to get the stuff out of there, and I said, &quot;Bob, you gotta help me. I don't... &quot;I just can't do this by myself.&quot; JEFF: You remember having to go to his then wife's place and getting his stuff and helping him move out? I don't remember. RICHARD: And it was a very embarrassing thing for him to go through this, but he said, &quot;Okay, I'll do it. I'll do it for you.&quot; And he said, &quot;You owe me, kid.&quot; I said, &quot;I know, Bob. I owe you.&quot; And he collected one day on that one. ♪ Just when you're sure ♪ Of a dream that you planned ♪ That's when the scenery changes ♪ It changes ♪ We both really didn't necessarily wanna be songwriters. What I wanted to be was a great symphonic composer, and Bob... I wanted to write the great American novel. He was determined. Or at least a California novel. And after graduation from college, we both set about to do that. I was writing my great symphonic sketches, and Bob was writing chapter after chapter of the most boring drivel you've ever read in your life. And I would say that about the music I was writing, too, because I don't wanna just, you know, single you out (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) for achievement... It's all right. ...in that department. But one day, our dad... There's a good punctuation now. JEFF: It's something I never really completely understood. You guys were very different, lived different lives, had different friends, but you still chose to live together. Why was that? It was economically good 'cause our folks were giving us the money. RICHARD: Bob and I took in a little apartment over a cleaning store. LARSEN: Dick always had his papers and everything all set up on the ironing board. I don't think they could afford a desk at that point. And the lady next door, who was upstairs, was deaf, so I could play the piano all I wanted, and Bob could pound on his typewriter as much as he wanted. One day, our dad came up to our little apartment. He said, &quot;I'll bet you two guys couldn't pool your talents &quot;and come up with a song that some kid would give up his lunch money to buy.&quot; Bob and I both kind of looked at each other and said, &quot;We could, you know, do something.&quot; So we tried it, and it wasn't easy. It was very difficult. Dad used to say, &quot;The three S's, &quot;keep it singable, simple and sincere. And original.&quot; ROBERT: He was the greatest teacher. Finally after about 3 or 4 months, he said, &quot;You got a hook here, in this one idea.&quot; And it was called... BOTH: Gold Can Buy Anything But Love. ROBERT: He pointed us in the direction of Hollywood and Vine, and he said, &quot;There are a lot of publishers out there. &quot;Now you go play 'em for them.&quot; RICHARD: Finally, one publisher said, &quot;You know, I think it's a pretty good song.&quot; We were overjoyed because Gene Autry had recorded it, and he was the number one country western singer of the day. RADIO ANNOUNCER: And now, here's our newest Columbia recording that we think is gonna be a big hit. ♪ Love, love, love ♪ ROBERT: Well, people on Vine Street were congratulating us. They heard it on the radio and said, &quot;How does it feel having a hit for your first time out?&quot; And we said, &quot;We don't know, you know, we don't know yet.&quot; One day we heard an announcer on the station saying, &quot;And now we're gonna hear Gene Autry's smashing hit. It's breaking all record...&quot; And we were ready to congratulate ourselves and... We started spending the money mentally. President Truman had recalled for General MacArthur and had asked him to resign. And MacArthur made a speech, and he concluded his speech when he said, &quot;I remember the old barracks room ballad.&quot; An old soldier never dies. They just fade away. RICHARD: And Mr. Autry decided to record it at the same day. Our song was called off the presses. It never saw the light of day again, and that was the end of our career as songwriters, we felt. By some amazing miracle, our father seemed to know we were gonna be charging into Hollywood to speak to our publisher, and he cut us off at the pass. He said, &quot;I know what you're thinking, &quot;but if you can't learn to take a curve in this business, &quot;get out of the business.&quot; ♪ Hup, two, three, four ♪ By the ranks or single file ♪ Over every jungle mile ♪ RICHARD: I was gonna be drafted, and I joined the Army Reserve. GREGG: He never saw any kind of action. Never killed anybody. He started conducting the band. RICHARD: I never fired a shot in anger. I shot my mouth off a lot. (LAUGHING) COLONEL: Wipe off that silly grin, soldier. This is the Army. LARSEN: Now, I'd met the Sherman Brothers kind of collectively back in the very early '50s. All of our friends were struggling artistes, if you will. We had, practically every week, our pals over, and, you know, we'd run pictures. Bob was there and Joyce was there but they didn't come together. They just met there. ROBERT: She was an airline stewardess. I was stricken with her. She was gorgeous. Slim, suntanned. I called her and asked her if she'd like to go to a movie. I couldn't look at the movie. I had to keep looking at her. I was nuts about her. I asked her to marry me. JEFF: On your first date. Yeah. And she called Wisconsin, and said, &quot;I have met a real great guy.&quot; It was simple. ♪ I might have known ♪ Life alone ♪ But that's where you came in ♪ Your lovin' arms ♪ Have saved me from ♪ The things I might have been ♪ And then a very similar thing happened with a lovely lady, who is now Elizabeth Sherman. I came back from a trip, and who was there? The girl that I wanted to look up in the first place that I had met a few weeks earlier. ELIZABETH: He asked me if I would like to hear a record he had just gotten, and I said, &quot;Oh, sure. What did you buy?&quot; And he said, &quot;Well, I didn't exactly buy it.&quot; And I said, &quot;Uh, what did you do, steal it?&quot; Because he had told me he was in the insurance business. And I was losing interest quickly because I thought he was too excited to see me, and he lies. Elizabeth taught me how to laugh at things. Changed my whole perception of life. ♪ About you, about me, about us ♪ About your love and mine ♪ Well, about time ♪ I think I'm instrumental in being cupid on those two things for just having a nice place for people to meet. ROBERT: I got one room in a building in Hollywood, and I let everybody know that I was publishing. JEFF: What was the name of your publishing company? Music World Corporation. Bob had a determination to publish songs on his own. ROBERT: I wrote with different partners. One of them was Bob Roberts. RICHARD: They were having a bit of success together, and I was doing my own thing, writing on my own. ROBERT: I didn't wanna write with him. We were going our own directions. RICHARD: He did say, &quot;Come up if you ever have a good song. You think you have... &quot;Nobody else wants it, bring it over here. &quot;Maybe I can do something with it.&quot; One day I was driving down Santa Monica Boulevard, and there was a sign, and it said, &quot;The Tall Girls Shop.&quot; Tall. Ooh. That's a good word. Tall. Bob Roberts and I had a start of a song called Chalk on the Sidewalk, Writing on the Wall. And Dick came in, and he joined us. ♪ Chalk on the sidewalk ♪ Writing on the wall ♪ Everybody knows it ♪ I love Paul ♪ Tall Paul ♪ Tall Paul ♪ Tall Paul ♪ He's my all ♪ The Walt Disney Company. They were looking for a song for Annette Funicello, who was a big star of the Mousketeers. We always called her our lucky star because she started it. ROBERT: It became a smash. Bob Roberts was not too happy about the fact that the kid brother was coming into the thing, and we wrote a lot of songs, the three of us. At one point, there was a big fight. Roberts said, &quot;I think I should add more bass.&quot; And Dick said, &quot;No.&quot; All of a sudden, he lost his cool. He threw a pair of scissors at me across this sound booth. Whap! Like that. I pulled out of the way, thank God. Bob got up, grabbed him and shoved him out of the door. And I said, &quot;I never wanna see that guy again.&quot; And from then on, Dick and I wrote together. ♪ Ooh, you come on like a dream, peaches and cream ♪ Lips like strawberry wine ♪ You're sixteen, you're beautiful ♪ And you're mine JEFF: Dad and Dick were occasionally landing songs and getting some airplay, but their families were growing, and it was tough to make ends meet. ♪ Well, you're sixteen, you're beautiful, and you're mine ♪ ROBERT: We started writing more songs for Annette, and she recorded about 15 of them. MAN: Take 3, Baker. Hold it. Uh, Pineapple Princess. And you guys knew how nervous I was, and you were so supportive and wonderful. Well, you see, the trick was, you know what Tutti said to me. He said, &quot;Any time she looks like she's a little worried about the song, &quot;you go in and sing it for her. &quot;She knows she can sing it better than you.&quot; ♪ Pineapple princess ♪ He calls me pineapple princess all day ♪ As he plays the ukulele on the hill above the bay ♪ RICHARD: Bob had gotten a phone call from the musical director of the Disney Record Company, and he said, &quot;The studio wants to put Annette into a film, &quot;and they need a song for her. Would you guys like to take a shot at writing it?&quot; Said, &quot;You're kidding? Really!&quot; He said, &quot;Yes, but they need it right away.&quot; So, we drove to the studio, and there was a big fence with a guard there. RICHARD: We thought we'd have to pay to park 'cause we had about 35 cents between us. ROBERT: So we parked outside the studio, and we walked in. Jimmy Johnson, the head of the music company at Disney, said, &quot;Walt wants to hear it.&quot; Walt Disney? So, Bob and I, terrified, walked into Walt Disney's office. ROBERT: And he started talking about a picture with two girls that were sisters. They were twins, but they had never met. They meet in summer camp. We let him go for a while. We said, &quot;But, Mr. Disney, we're...&quot; RICHARD: We didn't let him go. This was Walt Disney talking to us. You don't interrupt a man like that. But at a certain point, Bob got the courage to say, &quot;Mr. Disney, we came here to play you a song for The Horsemasters.&quot; And we played the first song we ever wrote for a Disney production, and that was a song called Strummin' Song. ♪ So, ho-hum, let's sing a strummin' song ♪ Ho-hum, let's sing a strummin' song ♪ Ho-hum, one that we can hum along ♪ Ho-hum, one that we can hum along ♪ He listened to the song, and he said, &quot;Yeah, that'll work.&quot; And we got kind of confused. &quot;What do you mean it'll work? It's a good song.&quot; We didn't realize that when he said, &quot;It'll work,&quot; he meant it'll work. ROY: Walt, of course, was never quite satisfied with anything, but he would drag you into doing something even better than you thought you could. RICHARD: He said, &quot;Listen, I wasted a lot of time &quot;on this other thing, so why don't you get 'em a script &quot;and maybe we can come up with a song for this picture.&quot; ♪ Let's get together, yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ Why don't you and I combine? ♪ Let's get together, what do you say? ♪ What do you say?

ROBERT: The book was called Mary Poppins. He said, &quot;You know what a nanny is?&quot; We said, &quot;Yeah, a goat.&quot; He said, &quot;No, no, no. It's a British nurse maid.&quot; I said, &quot;Oh, okay.&quot; This time he just said, &quot;Tell me what you think.&quot; We knew he was interested in us as writers, as thinkers. We found six chapters in her books that we could put together and make a story. RICHARD: We had just written about 16 bars of various songs. Two weeks later, we brazenly ask, &quot;Could we have a half an hour &quot;of Walt's very, very valuable time?&quot; And we stayed there for about two and a half hours, and he was as enthusiastic as we were with what we were doing. We circled the six chapters, and he smiled and turned around and got his copy, opened it to the index. The same six chapters were underlined. That was a miracle. He said, &quot;Play me that bird lady song again.&quot; ♪ Their young ones are hungry ♪ Their nests are so bare ♪ All it takes ♪ Is tuppence from you ♪ He looked at us and he said, &quot;That's what it's all about, isn't it?&quot; He said, &quot;You guys like to write, don't you?&quot; I said, &quot;Yes, sir. I always like to come here.&quot; &quot;Then will you write for me?&quot; We said, &quot;We love to work for the studio.&quot; And... (SIGHING DEEPLY) That was the day. That was the day. I think probably I'm the only person who is really close to both of them, has ever been really close to both of them, either professionally or personally and was close to both their wives. A.J. Carothers, one of Walt's favorite writers, became one of ours. We were very close. RICHARD: Bob loved A.J. too, and his wife Caryl, and we just kind of got along. Everybody was kind of fond of each other then. CAROTHERS: Working with them in the '60s, we were happily ensconced at Disney. We were all three very happy there. Walt Disney gave them a home. That was very unusual for songwriters. CAROTHERS: They were the only songwriters that Walt ever had under contract. The Sherman Brothers are not only very talented but very cooperative. They go for the team play, you know. That's the way we work here, as a team. They never knew what the next assignment was gonna be, but there would be one just around the corner. ♪ Color ♪ Color ♪ Color MALE ANNOUNCER: Walt Disney presents... ♪ The wonderful world of color ♪ We started getting paid by the Disney Company. It was marvelous. It was the second week that we were coming out of the studio. We had gotten our first $500 check each. They're paying us money to write songs. Couldn't believe it. It was exciting. That's more money than we ever had. Bob's car was in front of mine, and he held up five like that, and I held up five, and I waved back at him like that. And that was our hand signal. As the weeks went on, it was 600! And we were just reveling in our relationships with the studio and with Walt. ROY: Walt always knew that music was about story. Walt was all about story. He was a great storyteller. And both Bob and Dick were great storytellers, too. The Sherman Brothers, for more or less the first time, brought a musical theater sensibility to screen projects. That was, I think, very influential. We had a very definite philosophy. We don't start anything without an idea. The idea came first, then the music and the lyrics followed. And we'd both throw lines to each other, back and forth and we sort of Sherman-ize, we like to call it. And so many people pigeonholed their songs as children's songs. I didn't write kiddie songs, I wrote songs for kiddies.

I blew it. I blew it right there. I blew those words and notes. And Dick tends to not be very soft pedaled when he's playing and singing his songs. Once in a while, Bob and I would, like, be screaming some lyric or something, and then a little rustle would come under the door. ROBERT: A wonderful cartoonist named Roy Williams, he used to draw whatever went on in our office, write what he heard. BOTH: ♪ If you say it loud enough ♪ You'll always sound precocious ♪ Supercalifragilistic- expialidocious ♪ RICHARD: Better? (PLAYING PIANO) (PIANO KEYS BANGING) Oh! (PIANO PLAYING CONTINUES) Oh! (PIANO PLAYING CONTINUES) That was the best one. My brother, Dick, was spontaneous. I always was slow and plodding. He was in there, and it was exciting. It's great to work with a guy who's a sparkplug. RICHARD: When we come up with a good song idea, there were no two happier guys in the world. We just jumped for joy. It was just fantastic, and we knew it. We'd both look at each other and... &quot;Ah, yeah, we did it, yeah!&quot; They had the reputation, which was largely true, I think, that they could write a song over lunch hour and bring the next song back to you. When something is so engrained in the culture, people don't even have a connection with the fact that two guys sat in a room and had to actually work and create that. I was in their office, and Richard, Dick, would sit just playing the melody, really loud and just shouting out lyrics, anything that came into his head. (PIANO PLAYING) ♪ Put it in the album, ♪ Put it in the album, the family album ♪ Robert was sitting at his big desk, listening, and every couple of minutes, as Dick just went on just shouting things, Robert would raise his hand like this.

Put the date above it. And Dick would go, &quot;Oh, my God!&quot; And boom, go right in and sing the perfect line. ♪ All your friends will love it ♪ Your family album ♪ Put the dates above it, the family album ♪ Dick was always very easy to goof around with. We always thought of him as Mr. Sunshine, but Bob is much more retiring, and I didn't entirely know whether that was because he was shy or whether there was a sort of dark aspect to him that countered Dick's sunshine. Clearly, one might say, &quot;Oh, gee, Bob's moody.&quot; I think that is so skimming the surface of one of the most complex people I've ever met. Bob is a little more Feed the Birds, I think, and Dick is a little more Supercalifragilistic. GORDON: The closest analogy that I've ever been able to come up with is John Lennon and Paul McCartney, and if you think of Paul McCartney, bubbly, effusive, very much like Dick. You think of John Lennon, a little more sardonic, a little darker, like Bob. They would keep the songs from being too sugary and giving it just that little bit of adult twist to it. ♪ Up where the smoke is all billered and curled ♪ 'Tween pavement and stars is the chimney sweep world LASSETER: What the Sherman Brothers did with Walt Disney, they made these perfect moments where dialogue, visuals, animation, whatever, cannot communicate an emotion as good as that Sherman Brothers' song. ♪ On the rooftops of London ♪ Coo, what a sight! ♪ As a filmmaker now, I don't forget those moments. A man has dreams of walking with giants. To carve his niche in the edifice of time. ROBERT: Walt kept putting off Mary Poppins. Finally, I learned that he didn't have the rights. We had poured ourselves for two and a half years into this project. Dreaming of it and thinking about it. There was a woman who wrote the basic stories called Mrs. Travers, Pamela Travers. I didn't know until later, but I heard that she had to agree to sell him this stuff, but he put on with Bob and Dick, and with Don DaGradi and Bill Walsh, this enormous show for her. These are two giant boats, titanic vessels heading on a collision course, and somewhere in between is a little raft on which are sitting Bob and Dick Sherman. ♪ When the day is gray ♪ TRAVERS: No, no, no, come on. No, no, no, no. No, no, don't make it like that. She was a very feisty, ramrod straight old lady. She didn't really hit it off with children, oddly enough, for somebody who was so famous in the world of children's literature. She was a witch. Book freaked me out as a kid. She breaks her fingers off, and it's gingerbread and... She's kind of unpleasant. TRAVERS: I beg of you not to do that. You're going to spoil the whole thing. She didn't like any of the ideas we had from her book. None of them. She didn't appreciate the genius of what they had come up with. Walt said, &quot;Listen, I have a lot of work to do,&quot; and he just got up and left the room. I'd give anything to be there with you, but this seems to be one of those times I'm tied down here at the studio night and day. TRAVERS: Now, look, I do not think this is right. You had to say the right thing and try to press the right buttons with her. RICHARD: We wanna make this a great picture and want to do justice in some way to the magic of this wonderful pile of books here. We love Mary Poppins, we really do. TRAVERS: Thank you. ROY: She grudgingly finally came through. They made the movie that they saw fit to make. Take a look! It's her. It's the person. I was very daunted by the thought of doing my first movie ever. Those songs were so compelling and that's what made me feel, &quot;Yeah, I think if I was given half a chance I would be able to cut it.&quot; VAN DYKE: Bob and Dick Sherman, they play the songs for me, and I've never been so impressed or enthralled in my life, and I said, &quot;Oh, God, I've got to be part of this.&quot; ♪ But through the eyes of love you can start ♪ WALTON: One of the songs that Dick and Bob really loved when they originally played us the score was, I think, called The Eyes of Love, and given how incredibly positive Julie responded to the score, they were really kind of startled when she said, &quot;You know, I'm not sure about The Eyes of Love.&quot; I think she thought it was too direct. It was not oblique enough for Mary Poppins' character. This was the... One of the most important numbers to us, and we were kind of heartbroken about it. Then Walt said, &quot;Try to write something that would be more &quot;in keeping with the way Mary Poppins would feel.&quot; This one day I came home from school, and all the shades were closed in this room he was sitting in. He was sitting in a chair. I didn't even see him right away, it was so dark in the house. He asked me, &quot;How was your day?&quot; And I said, &quot;I had the Salk vaccine at school.&quot; He said, &quot;Well, you let somebody give you a shot? And did it hurt?&quot; And I said, &quot;No, they took up this plastic spoon &quot;and put a sugar cube on and put the medicine in it and you just ate it.&quot; And I saw my dad go like this... And with that, I said, &quot;A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down.&quot; And I couldn't wait to tell Dick. The next morning I said, &quot;A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down.&quot; He said, &quot;What?&quot; He said, &quot;You nuts?&quot; (WHISTLING) ♪ For a spoonful of sugar ♪ Helps the medicine go down ♪ The medicine go down ♪ The medicine go down ♪ Just a spoonful of sugar ♪ Helps the medicine go down ♪ In a most delightful way ♪ VAN DYKE: Both of The Boys, Bob and Dick, were there all the time, because they were so involved in it and so in love with it.

That's Richard Sherman. Robert Sherman, devastatingly handsome, very sartorial. Trying to describe to we kids what the scene was about. I was at a party the other night, and a 22-month-old girl, I mean, that tall, walked up and she said, &quot;Hi, Bert!&quot; And I said, &quot;Hi, what's your name?&quot; She said, &quot;Mary Poppins.&quot; She stepped on my lap, and we sang the entire song of... ♪ It's a jolly holiday with Mary ♪ ♪ Mary makes your heart so light ♪ You haven't changed a bit, have you? ♪ When the day is gray and ordinary ♪ Mary makes the sun shine bright ♪ Oh, honestly! That's the third, maybe the fourth generation of children that are charmed by that movie. It's a great tribute to the Sherman Brothers. We kind of stepped into the big time in a real serious way with Mary Poppins. MALE ANNOUNCER: Hollywood goes to a world premiere. It was a real live action movie, my goodness! And look at Disney doing this sort of thing. MALE ANNOUNCER: Here in the forecourt of the renowned Grauman's Chinese Theatre, all of Hollywood awaits the world premiere of Walt Disney's Mary Poppins. (BLOWING WHISTLE) It appears that Walt Disney is arriving. (CROWD CHEERING) Walt's last premiere was in 1937 for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. ROY: Bob and Dick and wives were in a limo together and creeping up to the front of the Chinese Theatre with their window down, and some little girl poked her head in the window and looked at them, looking for celebrities, and said, &quot;They're not anybody.&quot; And Joyce Sherman goes, &quot;We are too somebody!&quot; (LAUGHING) I always love that story, you know. And, of course, you know, by the time the evening was over, they indeed, they were somebody. ROBERT: Well, they had the parking lot tented with parties, and we're coming out of the theater, and Mrs. Travers was coming out with Walt. She didn't look too happy. She really was not too pleased. She said, &quot;Well, I guess we'll have to roll our sleeves up and get it straight.&quot; And he looked at her and said, &quot;Pamela, the ship has sailed.&quot; The period, 1963 to '69 basically, Walt brought songs and music into the parks for the first time. The first one was Tiki Room, which Bob and Dick wrote. LASSETER: The Sherman Brothers' music within the amusement park rides, it takes you to those places. You forget about the long line you just stood in. You are taken away. ♪ Welcome to our tropical hideaway, you lucky people, you ♪ If we weren't in the show starting right away, we'd be in the audience, too ♪ RICHARD: We were given the assignment to do a song for the UNICEF pavilion at the World's Fair, which was called &quot;UNICEF Salutes the Children of the World.&quot; The first time I met Dick and Bob, we had set up a, uh, test of how we were going to do the music from different countries, and it was a mess. It sounded like a million kids all singing different things. It was a cacophony. Walt says, &quot;Can you write one song that'll cover everything?&quot; I said, &quot;Well, we'll try.&quot; ♪ It's a world of laughter, a world of tears ♪ It's a world of hope People think it's a little novelty.

I get so moved in the boat, going through that and seeing all the children. There is something that is just so wonderfully moving, and the song always gets to me. It's like this life changing experience as a child when you go on it 'cause it's, sort of, kind of scary, but not. You do spend about five minutes in there where that thing just goes cycling around endlessly in your ear. Once it's in your head, it's just there forever, in a good way. It's a lovely song, the first four or five thousand times you hear it, and then it just like drills into your brain. You wake up in the middle of the night and it's still going. ♪ It's a small world after all ♪ No! No! Anything but that. I have this image of both your fathers sitting there like... (LAUGHING) It's probably the most important thing that's in any of the parks. Wouldn't it be wonderful if people acted like that, to the words of that song? In 1964, we all flew together on Walt's private plane to the World's Fair where they were introducing It's a Small World, and when the ride was about a third of the way through, the tape broke, and the four of us stood up and sang It's a Small World through the rest of the ride. Which was really fun. We had a good time together. ♪ It's a small world after all ♪ OSBORNE: Jerry Lewis said that when he and Dean Martin started out as a team that Lou Costello gave them advice that he had gotten from Stan Laurel, and that was never let your wives socialize with each other. Where you get four people involved in it, then personalities take over, and it doesn't work. CAROTHERS: The wives were very different, one from the other, as were their husbands. So I think had they not been brothers, they are two couples that never would have had a relationship because I don't think they had enough in common. Dick has never changed from the day they were above that cleaning shop. Very careful about where his money is spent. He probably has a big coffee can in his backyard full of gold. Dad is probably the most generous human being on the planet. I liked Laurie Partridge, I wanted a keyboard. So he got me this entire huge like church organ, and I think I played it eight times on total. Bob would be more the businessman, and I would be more the other guy. I would do things for nothing, just for the fun of it. Dick thought that Bob was, you know, extravagant and threw money around and Bob thought that Dick was, you know, close fisted and uptight, and so their lifestyles were different, and so they didn't enjoy being together. ♪ So there's a great, big, beautiful tomorrow ♪ Shining at the end of every day ♪ There's a great, big, beautiful tomorrow ♪ Just a dream away ♪ Well, it sounds pretty good.

We posed with one of them behind our backs so that it wouldn't look like we were overpowering her. ROBERT: Overnight, every doorman, every maitre d', every waiter knew our names. The next day, we went to Walt's office to thank him. So we marched in with our four Oscars and we put 'em on his desk, and he's working away on a script, and he looks up and he said, &quot;Well, boys...&quot; &quot;Congratulations.

CAROTHERS: Bob really got annoyed with the I-can-have-it- for-you-in-10-minutes thing. At times when he... He just lost it. JEFF: How'd you work with Uncle Dick? Like brothers. What would you do if you didn't like his ideas? I'd tell him so. What would you say? &quot;It stinks.&quot; And he'd say the same to me. LINDSAY: My father, Mike Conner, was the Shermans' manager for 30 years. He was also, sort of, their agent and lawyer, and given the relationship, he was also the referee and the mediator. We argue quite a bit. I'm gonna disagree with you on film. They could argue about almost anything. It's akin to poetry... But it has to be sung, so it really, truly isn't poetry in itself. And almost at the drop of a hat. We're the telescopes in the space of time. Okay. And you just sort of completely threw me 'cause I didn't know if you were disagreeing with me. Chris's question. I don't know... His question was... This shouldn't be on the film. A lot of my choice of lyricists is based actually on who I wanna be in the room with.

Because I said, &quot;Oh, damn it,&quot; and the piano went clunk on the floor. That's it. I didn't kill anybody. You know, but these are things, you know... We're brothers. Listen, we're human beings and break a piano or break a typewriter. You know, now you have computers. You can't hurt a guy too much with a computer. GREGG: How did you deal with my dad's temper? I dodged it as much as I could. I didn't really acknowledge it. Often, he would come home from work frustrated and angry with something Dick had done or said that day, and he'd wanna leave the team. And my mother would instantly pull out this typewriting table, put it in the middle of the room and say, &quot;Go ahead, write your novel.&quot; He'd write a poem or a short story and those frustrations would subside. Privately, Mom did more to keep the Sherman Brothers together than anyone ever knew. As time went on and their relationship became more and more strained, it was more difficult, of course, to work together. RICHARD: Walt was not happy with the first version of The Jungle Book, the way it was going, and he decided to scrap practically everything. He said one wonderful song by Terry Gilkyson called The Bare Necessities, which everybody knows and loves. ROBERT: Walt called us in. &quot;I'd like you to Disney-fy it.

Bob came to my office and told me that he was leaving, that he wouldn't be around for a while. He was worn out with everything, and he was very depressed, profoundly depressed. He didn't know where he was gonna go, but he was gonna be gone. Bob said, &quot;You gotta do this for me. I can't do this. &quot;I have to have some clothes. I gotta get out of here, &quot;and you're gonna have to help me. &quot;You're the only one who can do it for me.&quot; And I was reluctant. I didn't wanna do it, but I did 'cause he's my brother. JEFF: Tensions had been mounting between Dick's family and ours. For my mom, Dick showing up at our house to get Dad's clothes was the last straw. A lot of misunderstandings took place because I was trying to be kind to my brother and help him. Jeff, as a little boy, used to sit on my lap, and I loved him. He was a beautiful little boy and we just had a simpatico. It was fantastic, and I didn't see him after that. JEFF: A couple of days later, Dad was back, and no one ever talked about it. Bang, we just went... We'd see each other at events, and we'd always keep a nice front in front of everybody. Nobody ever suspected that Bob and I didn't see each other socially. This is painful stuff. I don't know. That's enough. I don't wanna talk about that. JEFF: Do you have a favorite Sherman Brothers song? Yeah. Which one? Called On the Front Porch.

I always thought of the Sherman Brothers as these really great heroes as long as there were musicals there. But they were kind of the flag bearers alone. The Happiest Millionaire was my first film.

JEFF: What did Walt say to you when you walked out of The Happiest Millionaire screening? &quot;Keep up the good work, boys.&quot; And it was kind of strange, 'cause he never said something like that, and then he walked down the hall again. That's the last time I ever saw him. He had cancer. He was saying goodbye. Walt dying happened pretty suddenly to most people. I loved him very much. SKLAR: Privately with Dick and Bob, he didn't mind showing that he was emotional, and that was rare. We didn't see it. ROBERT: This was Walt Disney's office, and often on Fridays he'd ask us to come down and talk with him. Then he'd say... He'd look to me and say, &quot;Play it.&quot; And, uh, I pretty much knew what he wanted. He wanted to hear his favorite song. After he was gone, I'd still come down on a Friday afternoon and play it for him. ♪ Feed the birds ♪ Tuppence a bag ♪ Tuppence, tuppence ♪ Tuppence a bag ♪ There was that feeling that the daddy genius was gone. And a lot of people were wondering what we're gonna do now without Daddy there, you know. Walt was, I'd call him uncle, but he was Daddy to an awful lot of people. RICHARD: Markedly, from the time Walt died, the phone stopped ringing. Nothing came to us. We had no good assignments. There was some hostility towards the Shermans from other folks at the studio. Some thought that they were, you know, Walt's special boys. It was like, um, we weren't needed anymore. We felt like unnecessary cogs in the wheel. Which was kind of about the time I decided it wasn't a lot of fun working there anymore, and I left. The phone rang one day and I thought it was gonna be an assignment. It wasn't that at all. It was somebody saying, &quot;Have you turned in your time card, sir, this week?&quot; And that was kind of strange because that was something that never was done in Walt's time. After a while, we just decided we wouldn't wanna stay there anymore and we left. BARBARA: My father had been producing the James Bond films. He really wanted to make a film for us, for us kids. He used to say it was the happiest experience he ever had on a film because he had a wonderful working relationship with the Shermans. It's ironic that so many times people say that it's another one of Disney's great pictures, and it wasn't. It was actually Cubby Broccoli. Oh, there was a prince of a man. Whenever we'd write a song, we'd play it for him. He loved it.

There are children here somewhere! I can smell them. JEFF: How do you think my dad's war experiences affected him? Well, it did, it has cast a shadow over his life. I think that, that... Anyone that you hear of or speak to who had visited any of the camps, they can never forget it. I was the first American into the Dachau prison camp. My squad and I walked in and we saw the poor bated prisoners and had terrible experiences looking at corpses and ovens, and it was enough nightmares for the rest of my life. JEFF: What did you do when you came home from the war? I relaxed, had a nervous breakdown. ROBERT: In 1943, I was 17. I didn't know anything about anything. But I learned. He never talked too much about it. He didn't talk about it. I don't think he wanted to. ROBERT: I've been painting many years, even before I was a songwriter. I love painting. I get rid of the thoughts of Dachau and the thoughts of explosions and pain and hospitals. Beautiful things helped clean my soul from the horror, but the horror lasted a long time. At that time, I didn't realize, and I don't think any of us did, what his personal experience had been in World War II. Sound the advance! (TRUMPETS SOUNDING) Just in time for the kickoff.

They didn't attend each other's receptions, and everybody else had to attend one or the other. Ever since I was a little girl, I was told, &quot;Well, if we meet at family events &quot;you can wave hello and be polite, and that's best.&quot; The first time that I met Richard Sherman and his wife Elizabeth was at an event, and they all went to another side of the theater, and I thought, &quot;This is kind of odd.&quot; Another person's weird is our normal, so that's just the way it was growing up. LINDSAY: Dad got to the point of exhaustion with the sibling rivalry on a number of occasions, but he always found a way to get back up the next day and have a plan to bring his boys back together again. ♪ He just knew that I was softhearted ♪ I was barely getting started ♪ Now I'm taking all of my fun... ♪ Why don't you try, uh, &quot;Now I'm giving all my time.&quot; Okay.

He would say, &quot;Well, this is not exactly doing Slipper and the Rose, is it? &quot;It's not really doing Charlotte's Web, is it?&quot; Or maybe it was me. I guess maybe I grated on him or something. Bob would retreat to his own thoughts and he would love to paint. He'd sit at home and paint and do all kinds of things like that and take trips up the coast. He would do all kinds of stuff that I just didn't. &quot;Why aren't you writing? I mean, this is the fun of life, is to write new songs.&quot; It wasn't necessary. We didn't just write songs to write songs. If there was a requirement for a picture, we'd do it. That's all. RICHARD: He became more Bob Sherman, and I stayed being Dick Sherman. MENKEN: Howard and I are... We're in this conference room, and we're presenting The Little Mermaid, and at a certain point we're told by one of the people at Disney, &quot;You know, next door over there, &quot;the Sherman Brothers are over there.&quot; I go, &quot;Really?&quot; He said, &quot;Yeah. Yeah, yeah. &quot;I mean, we gotta listen to them.&quot; But, you know, the implication being, &quot;You're our guys, you're the hip, new guys. &quot;You're coming in, and you're gonna be, &quot;you know, we're gonna be in business together.&quot; It was a surprising moment. I mean, on the one hand I felt this pride that we were now entering this tradition. On the other hand, you feel sort of the fleeting nature of our importance in Hollywood or in show business. I knew they wrote Small World, and I'm making a comedy that deals with this kind of fantasy land. I said, &quot;Write a real song that you would write &quot;for a theme park called Wonder World.&quot; You know, you're talking to Bob and Dick, they're both here, but you're talking to them as individuals, not as a team. I asked Bob and Dick if they would be in the movie. I was surprised how thrilled they were! Bob was in a bar with Arthur Hiller and Ray Harryhausen. You know, and he was good. Did you hear? Somebody shot Dave Thornton. Somebody shot Uncle Dave? Is there a TV here? Dick's cameo was just in the parade. It's just a moment they trimmed. He blew the whistle to lead the parade. (BLOWS) I saw Bob, I said, &quot;Hey, did you like yourself in the movie?&quot; And he said, &quot;Yeah.&quot; But with the glee with which he said, &quot;I enjoyed more that you cut Dick out.&quot; (LAUGHING) Dad died January 7th of 1993. He used to be the one that filled in where Walt wasn't there and where Dad wasn't there, it would be Mike, and then Mike passed away. And so there was nobody putting us together anymore. Bob is a romantic, and Dick is a sentimentalist. And a lot of people think that's the same thing, but it's not. F. Scott Fitzgerald had a wonderful definition. He said, &quot;A sentimental person thinks things will last, &quot;and a romantic hopes against hope they will not.&quot; And then one day Bob just said, &quot;I don't think we need the office anymore.&quot; We weren't getting these big assignments, and so I said, &quot;Well, okay. We will then.&quot; I thought it was an end of an era. Yes. Ironically, we got busy after that. LOGGINS: When we sat down to write the Tigger song, Richard said, &quot;Well, I was thinking of something like this.&quot; (VOCALIZING) ♪ That Tigger ♪ And I kind of went, &quot;Well, you know, um, &quot;I don't see me singing that.&quot; You know, and he turns to me and goes, &quot;Well, what did you have in mind?&quot; ♪ Sunny days and starry nights and lazy afternoons ♪ You count the castles in the clouds ♪ And humming little tunes ♪ I saw things happening that were so fast between the two of them that I didn't pay much attention to it. I just accepted it as the shorthand of two people who've worked together all their lives. They hadn't mentioned to me that they'd been away from the Disney camp for quite a while.

No. But it so happened at a point in my life when I became a widower, I decided to change my whole background. Bob found that everywhere he went was a reminder, and he couldn't bear it, so that he had to get to someplace where there were no memories. Dick and I were at Bob's house, and Bob said to me, &quot;I'm moving to England.&quot; And Dick said, &quot;What?&quot; I didn't know, but he had leased out his house and taken an apartment and lives in London now. I donated these two paintings of mine to the temple. My wife's name is up there. They dedicated it to her.

Personally cut it out and fixed it up and put it into this frame with a little note, and the note is something I'll treasure forever. &quot;The sun reflects upon our smiles. Now we awaken and the mirror lies. &quot;Time and place is transient. &quot;Only love and memory abide, &quot;for within our hearts the major music hides. &quot;On this, the celebration of your birth, &quot;your worth to me is more than I can say. &quot;It is rooted in the suns... (STIFLED SOBBING) &quot;In the suns of yesterday.&quot; JEFF: If you ask them how long it takes to write a song, their old saying is, &quot;Your entire life and the time it takes to jot it down.&quot; And when you get to know them and understand what they've been through and with each other, it's almost like a Greek tragedy in a way.
