Please cross the bridge and turn left, and continue to follow the road for 42 miles. Please turn right and continue for six miles. Please turn right. You have reached your destination. All right. How you doing? I'm Edmond Murray. Hi. Can I see your ID, please? Of course. Here you go. Mr. Murray's just arrived. Copy that. Good morning. My name's Officer Birch. How you doing? I'm the initial investigating officer. Uh-huh. Ms. Richmond is waiting for you over by the water. I'm Ethan's dad. I know that, Mr. Murray. I'm afraid that I cannot comment any further on the case. Inspector Roy will be down here later on. He'll be able to fill you in on any questions. Okay. Ms. Richmond is just down by the water, if you follow the path over to the right. Okay. Thank you. Joan! Fuck. Joan! What are they doing out there? They're looking for him. They think he's in the water? I don't know. I don't know. What the fuck happened? I don't know. That's where he was sleeping. You all right? I can't go back there. Can I go in there? No, sorry. Fuck. I've rented this place. I'm going to stay here. Okay, I'll stay somewhere near. Good. Would you be able to do something for me? Mm-hmm. I need you to go back to the house. Ethan drew me a picture the day before he left and... I can't stop thinking about it. Thanks. Do we know anything about the people that run that camp? No, they said they've questioned everyone. Did you meet them? Before you sent him? Yeah, I mean... They seemed really lovely. The woman was really lovely. I don't... Uh-huh. I... I'm sure they were fine. I'm sure they were fine. I never would have sent him there if I thought that there was anything wrong. Ever! I know, I know. You're a good mum. I know. Hi. Are you okay? - Yeah. - Yeah? - It was fine. - What did they want to know? Well, they just had some questions. What sort of stuff? My relationship with Ethan. Why? No. Are you on your way back? Can you come back? Okay, all right. - Bye. I love you. - Love you. Bye. Is that your man? Yeah. Was it his idea to send him to the camp? Oh, fucking hell. Yeah, sure, it was his idea. He's my son. Okay? It was my choice. I wish he hadn't gone. So do I. I didn't want him to go in the first place, but... kids his age, they're doing stuff like that. And Ethan's not... He's... He's different, and he... he didn't want to go. And I knew he didn't want to go. He seemed okay, before he went? I just... I just needed a... I'm sorry. Was it... He's been having a hard time. Okay? All right? Get them ready to go. Inspector, this is Eddy, Ethan's dad. All right, Mr. Murray. I'm Inspector Roy. Inspector. I'm running the investigation with my team here. Mr. Murray, I'd like you to come into my office this afternoon at 3:00, please. Of course, 3:00. The details are on the card. And my personal mobile number is on the back, should you need it. Miss, are you sure you want to take part in this? Yeah. Yesterday, you seemed-- No. You sure? I'm here. I can take over. No, I want to do it. Very good. If you'll just listen to the instructions and then I'll tell you where to stand. Okay. Thank you. Attention, please, everyone! This morning, we're going to search this entire slope. I want you to move through the bracken together. You keep two meters apart. If you find anything, you raise your hand and you shout, "Here!" It's very important that you touch nothing. Understood? All right. Thank you all for coming. Take your positions, please. Where do you want us? You can stand here, at the end of this line. Thank you. Two meters, two meters. Kennis! Let's go! Ethan! Ethan! Ethan! Ethan! Ethan! Ethan! Ethan! Ethan! Ethan! Ethan! Ethan! - Who's she? - Inspector Roy can tell you. Please, come with me. How you doing? Mr. Murray. Please. Is there any news? Nothing, as yet. How are you coping? I've-- I've known better days, you know? Allow me to tell you where we are. The alert plan has been triggered since yesterday morning. Good. We continue to interview everybody who has come into contact with your son. Now, the supervising staff at the camp, they tell me that they would do regular checks of the tents and the pods, to make sure that the children were asleep and all was well. The last check took place at 1:00 in the morning. And he was in there? He was in there. At that point, everything was fine. When I looked at his cabin, I could see his clothes were still in there, his bag was still in there. His little snacks were still in there. Now, Mr. Murray, I have to tell you that we're investigating every hypothesis, including kidnapping. Now, allow me to ask you a number of questions. You may find some of these questions unsettling, intimate. May I? No, don't worry. You can ask me whatever you want. First of all, I understand that you've been traveling a great deal. You've been in Libya, Saudi Arabia, Iraq. Why is that? My work's international. I've been working abroad for the last ten years, um, give or take. I work in the oil fields, and I go wherever they send me. Would you say your business, your work was dangerous? The work, in itself, is not dangerous. You can sometimes be in places where you are in danger. And I am constantly aware, when I'm in certain places, that I need to watch my back. Have any of these things affected you, Mr. Murray? Ah... A subordinate of mine was taken hostage. We went through a whole fiasco trying to get him back. It was a fucking mess. And we ended up paying the hostage ransom. Sir... Oh, come on. If you've got something to say, you can say it in English. I'd like to ask you for your mobile phone. We need it for the purposes of the investigation, to retrieve the contacts. It's procedure. I'm not supposed to give my phone out. I'm sure you can appreciate the importance of this, at this point in time. I completely can. The nature of my work means there's sensitive material on here. You just need my contacts? Yes. Thank you. It would be fair to say that most of the countries where you work would be unsuitable to take a child to, yes? Most of them, yes. The hours that I work, and the far-flung places I end up in, even if they aren't insecure, aren't suitable for taking a child. I can't take him all over the world. He's got to be in school. He's got to have his friends, got to have some stability. He's got to have a house, a family. And I can't offer him that. When did you last see your son? I saw him at Christmas time. I saw him... I saw him on Skype at Christmas time. He seemed fine. Do you have a good relationship with your ex-wife? It's not-- It's not bad. It's not her fault we split up. Is there any antagonism? From me, none. Do you have any contact with her new partner? I've seen him on Skype a few times. He seems fine. Have you security checked him? Because isn't it well known that nine times out of ten, it's someone you know, someone in your family? This is the case, which is why it's part of our primary investigation. And you? Is there someone new in your life? Yes. Yes, I have a partner. I've been seeing her for five years. Two years ago, your wife told you that your son was unwell. I came back and we went away together for a month. We had a cracking time. We went all over North America. And... And then I went back to work. Do you have reason to believe that it's because of what I do that Ethan has been taken? I have reason to believe that somebody made a decision to choose your son and not the other child. That's why I'm asking you these questions, Mr. Murray. Why Ethan? Why him? Why not the other boy? Unfortunately, all you can do at this point in time is wait. Wait for us to contact you. - How you doing? - Edmond. Nice to see you. Come in. All right. Thank you. Joan? Where's Joan? Ah... She... She's resting. Sit down. You want a whiskey? Aye. Sure, thank you. Brutal weather outside, eh? Uh-huh. Apparently, it's going to be... It's going to be an early winter, apparently. I mean, that's what, you know, the locals are saying. All the old people. But no one fucking believes them anymore, do they? They just believe the... the fucking Internet. Slainte. Joan's just... She really broke down tonight. You know, I just think it really fucking... really hit her. I know. Fair enough. So I've just given her a little something to help her sleep. So hopefully she'll get a full night, so I'm not gonna-- What did you give her? Fuck. I don't know the name of it. Um... I... I struggle with sleep occasionally and I got a prescription fucking ages ago but... How long has she been asleep for, with that? Um... About an hour and a half ago, something like that. But I don't think-- I don't think I should wake her up, really. She needs the rest. Nothing to worry about. Okay. Yeah. It's not a regular thing. In the circumstances-- All right, man. All right. Yep. So what are you... What's going to happen with your work? What are you going to do? Ah, work can wait. It's easy for me, really, 'cause I work for myself. I set up a business. I've got this construction company and... I mean, it's, you know, small but I've had it for about 15 years. I started in my early 20s. Based here? International? No. No, I'm not like you. No. No, I... I want to stay here. Local, really. It's small, you know. I started it myself. It was a grind, believe me. But now I've recruited enough people that it just kind of runs itself, which is great. So I can now essentially just be here, be there for Joan and... Nothing more important than that, eh? She's fucking amazing, man. Have you heard anything? Has anybody called or... Today? Uh-huh. What about? The searches? No, no. To be honest with you, my focus is really on her, you know. I'm just focusing on her. No. I'm actually just going to switch my phone off for a bit. Is that a good idea? Well, you're here. You've got your phone on, no? I just wanted to have a conversation-- Yeah. No, no. I just don't want to be disturbed. So where are you going to stay? Joan said you don't really have anywhere around here anymore. Don't worry about me, Frank. I'll be fine. I'll find something. Why don't you stay at Joan's? I mean, it's technically your-- your place, as well. Aye. Well, if you're not going to be there... Listen, I understand that you and Joan might need some space. No, look, it's-- Time together. I can-- I can escape. My parents-- I inherited this little shack in the middle of fucking nowhere. I can go and, you know, get out of the way. I'm selling it, actually. Because, following in your footsteps, I found this unbelievable bit of land, and now we're going to build a house, and it's just so beautiful. Joan loves it. The light is amazing. Actually, can I-- can I show you something? Here, come into the kitchen. Come on. So these got delivered today, actually. I was just looking over them. So, I've been working with this architect. He works in my company. So he's designing it with me, and Joan also. So this is the outside of the house. The sea is here. And we've got all the light here. It's beautiful. Glass here. Actually, I think I want a bit more. But then this is the top floor. We've got our bedroom here. Lots of light for Joan. It's going to be unbelievable. And then down here is the basement. Just don't really know what to do with it. Maybe... Maybe a games room or... Be careful. What do you think? Are you actually fucking kidding me? Um... Where's Ethan's room? Okay... Are you putting him in the basement? No, we're not putting him in the basement. I can see that you're angry and upset-- Joan! Hey, hey, hey! She's asleep. No. She's asleep. I need to talk to her. Hey. I need to talk to her. Why? She's asleep. 'Cause my fucking son's missing. Yeah, I'm aware of that. I'm aware that your son's missing. He's also my son. I love him very much. Don't. Fucking don't. Don't what? Don't tell me he's your son, as well. Well, let's be honest. He's been... He's been more my son than he has yours the last year, hasn't he? You're a very fucking weird man! What have you done with my son? I've done nothing with your son. What the fuck have you done with my son? I love your son! What the fuck have you done? Inspector Roy, you need to come over here. I'm at Joan's rented accommodation. I'm here with her partner, Frank. He's unconscious. He's been high as a kite. He's given her drugs. And he knows something. He fucking knows something. Please call me back at this number as soon as you can. -Get the fuck off! -Get in the van! Get in the van! Please, you're making a mistake! You're making a big mistake! Hey, there's a picture in the bag. Just give it to Joan! Just get in the van! You're making a mistake! What? Section 1 of the Criminal Justice Act... You don't understand. The man has taken my son. Or he's done something to my son, or he fucking knows something about my son. You've gotta go back there! You take me to fucking jail, and you're taking him to the hospital? Do you understand? You're having a fucking laugh! ...informed of your arrest and you'll have access to a solicitor. These rights... Fuck! ...will be explained to you further once we arrive at the police station. I suggest you make yourself comfortable, Mr. Murray. I don't care how fucking badly he is hurt. The minute he wakes up, you need to ask him what he's done with my son. You're not going to say anything? Nothing? My son's missing! My son's missing! Fuck. That's my wallet. That's... They're actually Joan's keys. That's Frank's phone. That's my phone. You want to put that somewhere else? Put it in there, please. That could be evidence. Make yourself at home. All right. Obviously, you'll be held in custody until the morning. I'll come back then and we'll see what's to happen to you. I'm really sorry about everything that happened. But have you spoken to him yet? I have to impress upon you, Mr. Murray, you're wasting our time now. Every hour is critical, and you're wasting our time. There's something not right about that guy. The day after my wee boy's gone missing, he's showing me blueprints of some house that he wants to move into with my wife-- my-- my ex-wife. And he doesn't have a room in that house for my son. Either he knows something or he's criminally a fucking prick. Please, Joan's taking Valium and going to sleep. I have known that woman. She's a good mother and she would not take anything that would stop her answering that phone. She would be up checking that phone every 15 minutes. So I am really sorry. I apologize. I'm not going to talk anymore. But please, just treat him seriously. You're not stable right now. I'm telling you straight. You're in no position to tell me how to conduct this investigation. I'll see you. It's my wee boy... Mr. Gilchrist is still in hospital. He has two fractured ribs. He has a dislocated hip. Nonetheless, he's decided not to press charges against you. Were you able to talk to him? I've communicated with him. I have taken a similar position. I'm not going to take this any further, Mr. Murray. One of my colleagues has retrieved your car. It's at the station here. You're letting me go? You're no longer in custody. You don't think it's weird that he's not going to press charges? Mr. Murray, I'll explain something very significant to you, to help you clear your mind of all of this. One month ago, your wife suffered a miscarriage. What? Yes. I'm telling you this, so that you can understand the situation, the predicament of both Ms. Richmond and Frank Gilchrist. Now, this was a very difficult thing for her to deal with. In fact, this is the reason that she decided to send your son to the camp. So that she could get some calm, some peace, to deal with this. It was nothing to do with Mr. Gilchrist. Is she all right? In these circumstances, no. And I understand that this is a very difficult period for you. I'd like to offer you psychological support. You need to go home. You need to clear your head of this, to allow us to go on with the investigation. No, I'm fine. I won't be any more problem to you, I promise. Thank you. Thank you for your patience. Hi, this is Leah. Leave me a message. Thank you. Leah, it's Edmond. Um... I'm here. I'm sorry I've not checked in earlier. I got in a bit of trouble with the police last night. I'm fine. I'm absolutely fine. And we haven't heard anything about... what's happened to Ethan yet. Could you tell the company I'm really sorry I haven't checked in? Can you do that for me? Tell them I'm okay and I'll be in touch soon. Um... I love you. If you get this call, just please call me back, okay? Joan! Joan? Joan. You okay? Have they found him? No. Not yet. Joan. I'm really sorry for what happened to you. What do you mean? About your wee baby. I'm very sorry. Who told you that? Inspector Roy. He was trying to-- Well, he's got no fucking right to tell you that. I know you guys were going through a very difficult time, even before this. Fuck off. Was it hard for Ethan? 'Cause he said that you... I... You needed peace and... I mean, this is bad enough, as it is. I don't know what you're trying to do to me. I'm not trying to do anything. He didn't... He didn't want me to have a baby. Ethan? No, of course he didn't. Does that make you happy? That he hated it? No. 'Cause he fucking hated the idea. He hated that Frank had moved in. And he hated the fact that you weren't here anymore. And the only person he could talk to about it was me, because you weren't here. So I had to deal with our son being upset about something that I was really happy about. I'm really sorry about that. Where were you last night? I was in the police station. They just let me out. They said Frank's not going to press any charges. He fucking should. Did he give you Valium last night? Yeah. I've never known you to take a pill in your life. Well, you don't know me anymore. Okay. I thought you were going to say you were sorry. That's what I thought you were going to say. I thought you were going to say sorry for beating the shit out of my boyfriend. You know, he never even mentioned Ethan. He's all excited about his blueprints for his new house that's he's building. Yeah, we were really excited about that! We were really excited about that. Ethan was excited about that. And we all talked about it together, as a family. Me, him and Frank. We all sat down and we discussed it. That's what we do. That's my family. And you'd know that if you asked about him, if you asked your son about him. But you don't, do you? Because you never fucking call and you never fucking do anything. You sent a present on his seventh birthday. He doesn't even get the chance to talk to his dad. Have you even thought about what this all means? That your son's missing? All I've been thinking about this whole time is that I'm a bad mother, that I've done something wrong. Have you even thought for a fucking second what sort of father you are? What sort of father you've been to your son? I know, I know. I know I'm a bad dad. I know I'm never here. I know he can't rely on me. But it's not my fault he's gone missing, darling. I just... Hey, hey! Stop and think for a minute. Just think of what we need you to do. Frank is not... He's a beautiful, strong, amazing man who loves your son. I don't believe that. Right. Why do you think that my phone is being tapped? Listen. At 2:00 this afternoon, I got a call from Glasgow. They asked me to come off this case. I said, "Why? Why should I drop this file? Why? You must send me a written explanation why I should drop this file." And they yell at me, shout at me. And I hung up. At 2:17, I get a call, this time from London. From Sir Patrick Nelson. This man, he's higher up than anybody in the police force in Scotland. And he tells me this case will be handled from London. This time, I get a chance to say nothing. He tells me that this is in everyone's best interests. And that's it. At 3:00, I tell my team we're no longer involved. And I leave. I didn't have much faith in a kidnapping related to your work in the oil industry. I could be wrong. London must have some information that I don't have. But I'll tell you this. You're on your own. Basically, you're on your own, Mr. Murray. I can't stay. Don't use your phone. Thank you. Come on, darling. Pick up. - Hello? - Leah? - Can you hear me? - What's this number? What's this number you're phoning on? It's not my phone. Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me. No, you listen to me. Do you have any idea what's been going on here? Do you know the cops came into the office? They turned the whole place upside down. They've got the computers. They've got the hard drives. They've got everything, Edmond. - Do you understand what this means? - What? They've got all the files. I mean, they've got the Iraq files. I mean, Jesus! Has anybody mentioned my name? Has anybody been looking for me? Listen to me. Listen to me, Edmond, okay? I've gotta tell you this. Don't call me again. Do you understand? -Leah... -Do you understand? I'm sorry. - Can I take it off? - Yeah, sure. - Oh, my God! - Joan. That is not what I was expecting at all. What do you think? It's amazing, eh? - It's amazing. -I know! We can build a house along here. I was thinking this is where, you know, if you wanted to... we could, you know, start a family. Yeah. Yeah! I want to, yeah. - Well, I love you very much. - - I love you. You clever, clever man. Ready? Make a wish! Three, two, one! Come on! One more, one more, one more. Come on, come on, come on! Come on, come on! Don't leave me hanging! Yay! Do you like it? Okay, okay. Let's open the big one now. This is the one. This is from Daddy, who wishes he could be here, but he can't be here today. This is from Dad. - Oh, my God. - Oh, my goodness. What's that? It's a helicopter. Isn't that amazing? Yeah? Ethan, how do you like your present from your dad? Yeah? Good present? All right! You're doing really good. You're a good mum. You are a good mother. A rocket! Whoa! Oh, my God! You got that? Ethan! You having fun? Are you happy? You having a good birthday? Look, Ethan! Look! What do you think? It's pretty cool, eh? You're going to be hanging out with that guy. Hey? Look at that! Hi, guys! How you doing? Yeah, sure. You want to say goodbye to your pal? See ya! Are you all ready for this, junior astronauts? - Yeah! - - That's what I like to hear! Okay, so, just to let you know, Mums and Dads, before you head off, we've got loads of busy days-- Love you. You'll be all right, okay? Just try and enjoy it. You'll have a great time. Say bye-bye to them, Mums and Dads. I love you, darling. Bye, Ethan buddy! Have fun! Bye, Ethan! There we go. The first-- The first time he's slept away from home. - Bye, darling! Love you! - Bye, Ethan! Come on, give us a wave. Bye, bud! Go on, Ethan! Go, go, go! Come over here. Go, go, go! - Who wants a balloon? - Me! They're all tangled up. They're going to be well-fed. They're-- Astronomy camp-- Have fun! Hi, are you okay? Frank? Hey, Joan. It's not Frank. It's me. - Why are you calling me on Frank's phone? - I took it off him last night. The police thought it was mine, so they gave it back to me. Please, before you get angry with me, can you listen to me? Can I come over? I'll give you-- Why? I think I've found something. You're going to be hanging out with that guy, eh? Isn't that amazing? Want to say goodbye to your pal? I can't watch this. Why are we watching this? See ya! Just have a look at this. The same car? Two different places, two different times, and the common factor being our son. Well, the common factor's not our son. The common factor is that he was at a birthday party with all his friends, and then he went to adventure camp with all his friends. So that's... It's probably just one of the parents' cars. That's fine, that's fine. Worst-case scenario, I'll turn up at his mate's house and I'll get a sympathetic cup of tea with some innocent dad. I think you need to call your brother. Oh, fuck... Call your brother. He still works in insurance. He'll be able to get the license plate. He'll be able to get the home address. Yeah, illegally. I still think... I still think we should call the police. I can't-- I told you before-- I know! I can't... We are on our own. Darling, we are all that Ethan's got. Those were Inspector Roy's last words to me. Call your brother. Now. They might have already moved him. Fine, fine! Go, go, go. Rob, Hi. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry it's so early. Yeah, I know. No. Nothing yet, no. Um... Look, I need you to do something for me, if you can. I don't know, it looks like a house or a building or something. It's in the middle of nowhere. It's not that far away. If I take the long road, I can come around on it from behind. All right, look, William O'Connor. Have you ever heard that name? No. I don't know. All right, fuck it. Fuck it. All right, I'll come with you. No, no, no, no. No! You have to let me go. No, I can't just stay here. If something happens to me, he's going to need one of us. Okay? Just think before you do anything, okay? Don't do anything stupid. Uh-huh. All right? And if you're not back by midday, then I'm calling the police. That's it! Okay? That's it, Eddy! Call Inspector Roy. All right. I've got Frank's phone. Maybe, maybe, maybe, you might see a shooting star or a comet or something. Wow! Your mum has done amazing research into this camp. I think I just saw a little smile. You will reach your destination in 300 yards. You will reach your destination in 200 yards. You will reach your destination in 100 yards. You have reached your destination. Turn around. Turn around. It's too dangerous now. I need to wait. I'll leave in 20, I think. Okay. Look at me. Look up. What the... Look at me. Look at me. Do you know who I am? No. Do you know why I'm here? No. I know who you are. What are you talking about? I've got pictures of you. I got pictures of your car. My car? Outside the Lockey Camp. What? Outside the climbing center in Crianlarich for two weeks following my son. Do you know who I am? You're fucking mental, man. Do you know why I'm here? You're making a mistake here, man! This is fucking nothing-- Tell me what I want to know! I don't know what you're fucking talking about, man. Tell me what I want to know! What about? Where's my fucking son? You've made a mistake, man! Just fucking untie me and let me-- Tell me where my fucking son is! Or I will drive this up through your mouth, up through your brain, and outta the top of your fucking head. Do you understand? I don't fucking know! You fuck! What are you fucking doing, man? Don't fucking do that, man! You've made a mistake. Untie me, let me go, and I'll say fuck all about this, mate, all right? Man, what are you fucking doing? Man, don't fucking do that, man! I don't fucking know! Tell me where my wee boy is. I don't fucking know! Fucking tell me where my wee boy is. I don't fucking know. You going to tell me where my wee boy is? I don't fucking know... What the fuck! Where's my fucking son? I don't fucking know, man! I don't fucking-- No, man! You take my fucking son? Don't fucking do that! I'm going to burn your fucking feet off. No, don't do that! Tell me right now! I don't fucking know. Where the fuck is my son? I don't know. Where's my fucking son? You going to tell me? Okay, okay, okay! Tell me where he is. He... He... What? Fucking speak! Dunmore Lodge. Where? Dunmore Lodge. We take 'em there. We drop them there and they come and pick them up later. Who? I don't fucking know. Who? I fucking swear! I swear! I don't fucking know that, man! I swear... I don't fucking touch them, man. I'm not like them! I'm not fucking like them. I'm not like that. I just deliver them. I drop them off and that's fucking it. You don't touch them? Never, man. Never. Who touches them? Who touches them? I don't know, man. I just... I take photos. Fucking... I take photos outside the schools. And then... And then they pick them. I'm sorry, man. Don't fucking hell, man! No! He should be here. Huh? He should've been here at least 15 minutes ago! Call him again, then. William, where the fuck are you? You're late! Come on. Spit it out. Get in. Get in. He's still not picking up. - Shit! - I don't like this. There's cops everywhere. They put roadblocks everywhere. The whole area's swarming with cops. Maybe he got nicked. Forget the girl. Let's take what we have and get outta here. They really wanted the girl, though. Okay. We're not staying here. Let's go. - Let's go! - Hurry up! Fuck. Fuck it! Steven! It's fucking flat. When did that happen? It must have been done on the road, when we drove here. Probably a nail or a screw. Those can make it deflate slowly. It takes me five minutes to put the spare on. Take the kid back inside. I'll call you when I'm finished. Steven? Steven! Where the fuck is he? Steven! Where are the fucking keys? Give me your fucking keys. Here we go! Steven! Steven! Inspector Roy, it's Joan Richmond. Can you call me as soon as you get this? Steven! Are you there? Are you there? Steven! What the fuck are you playing at? Steven! Where the fuck is he? Have you seen Steven? He's not downstairs? Have you got the car keys? No, Steven has them. Where the fuck is he? Call him! Shh, shh, shh... Steven, where the hell are you? We're looking all over for you. Listen to me. That wee boy that you've got is my son. The police are on their way. You have to leave the little boy where he is and just run away. It's your only shot, pal. You listen to me, prick. I'm coming for you. Stay with the boy. What if the cops come? Bullshit! Do what I told you. Fuck! Hey, man! Hey, man! Hey, Ethan! Ethan, can you wake up, pal? Can you wake-- Can you wake up? You stay asleep. Eddy! Joan! Eddy! Shh, shh! Come this way. Come on, quickly. You okay? Yeah. Fuck! Fuck! Is he still following us? I can't see. Joan... Joan! Eddy? - Eddy! - Eddy! Eddy? Eddy? Eddy! Eddy! It's all right! It's all right! It's me. You're safe, you're safe. Oh, geez! The boy... The boy is all right. It's all right. There you go. Just be real gentle and take it over to the left, like that. Oh, you see it bob like that? - You want a go? - Yeah, you want a go? - Yeah, sure. -You want to try it? Okay. Here we go. Right. Here we go, the vital moment, the transference of power. Get your fingers on it. Ready? Get your fingers on it! There, you've got it, wee man. It's all yours. Well done, Ethan. Well done, pal. Is it good? Don't bring it too close towards you. I want to keep my hair. You cheeky thing... Whoa! So good, wee man. So good. I'm going to leave this to you, 'cause you seem to know what you're doing. You do! Kinda. It's making me scared. Don't drop it on our heads! Whoa! Wow! Wow! You'll be a pilot for the MOD before you know it. Mr. Murray! Hey, pal... I'm going to need to get going. Should we land it and say a proper bye-bye? Okay, all right. I love you, pal. When are you coming back? Um... I might be a wee while. Okay. But I am going to come back. I'll come back and be here, okay? Okay. Okay. See ya, Joan. See ya. You okay? Yeah. Whoa! The dismantling of the network is accelerating, you know. I believe that there will be more arrests. It'll be a big list. What a shame. But it could be good for you. You think? Yes. The judge will probably take this into account. Aye, hopefully.
