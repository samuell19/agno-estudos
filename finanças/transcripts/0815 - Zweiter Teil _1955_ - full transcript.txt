08/15 PART 2: AT THE FRONT Based on the book by HANS-HELMUT KIRST DIRECTED BY PAUL MAY Russia, Winter of 1941/2. The fronts were stiff with ice and snow. "General winter" was in charge. - Close the window, there's a draft! - Damn shit! Come on, out! - Go fuck yourself! - It wasn't that deep! Close the window, there's a draft! Who's the bloody idiot who left his car out here? Shall I push this road louse into the ditch? Bullshit! You better stop. Officer's baggage. Whose is the jalopy out there? Close the door! I asked, whose is the jalopy? Hello, is that Army Headquarters? That's no jalopy, that's an Opel Kapitaen. Come out, move that scrap heap aside. We can't get through. Anyone can get through. Come out this instant or I'll smash your state couch! - I'm phoning, don't you hear?! - I hear. Don't you see there's an officer standing before you? - Yes, I see that. - My rank is captain. - Yes, captain. - Don't order my driver around. The only one who gives orders here is me! I respectfully ask the captain... to order the captain's driver. to kindly drive the captain's car aside. - What's your name? - Asch. - Rank? Unit? - Sergeant. Third battery, third Artillery regiment. And do you know who's in charge of your battery? First Lieutenant Wedelman. Big mistake! Because I'm in charge of your battery. As of today What do you say now? The third battery will be mighty pleased! I hope so You seem to be a messy lot. I'll get you going! Zest and Discipline! Wait outside! I'll check myself whether you can get past my car or not! Yes, Captain! Come in, this will take some time... Is some idiot making trouble? 08/15 operations! - He comes from the moon? - No, from home! It's exactly the same! Close the door, you're not at home here. - Can't you wait outside? - Shut up! I want to report to the captain that it's cold outside! I said: wait outside! Kindly notice from now on... every order I give is to be obeyed without reservations! Yes, captain! - The Army Headquarters! - It's about time! Major Bär please. Hello, Richard! Witterer. Captain Witterer, quite speechless, are you? They're quite a messy lot, but we'll lick them into shape! Listen, I wanted to ask you, how's little Lisa? Lisa Ebner? Did it work out? Super! And in our section of the front, no less You're a genius! You're invited when we get Lisa to take care of us... By Lisa always, right? Yes, yes. First Lieut Wedelmann, reporting to the Lt. Colonel. Not so much fuss, Wedelmann... you'd better crank up my gramophone. Wait, not that side, it's all scratchy, the other one... careful, careful, it's the only record I've got left. What's your opinion on the situation, Wedelmann? Hasn't changed in four months, sir. You're an intelligent boy, you may speak your mind. You always have to be explicit with your stupid commander. As soon as the thawing starts, supplies will stick in the mud. So...? The whole column should retreat at least 40 kilometers. Bravo, bravo! That's what I've been saying for months! - And why doesn't it happen? - Hitler must have his reasons. And the main reason is: "German soldiers don't retreat an inch." without considering human and material losses. The latest in modern warfare. But we don't get the modern weapons for such warfare. And the shitty war has only just begun! If I can't trust the Führer, whom can I trust? You don't have to think of the Nazis whenever I say shit. What's with the Army Headquarters? Busy. What's with the new portable telephones? We requested them months ago, sir. I'm getting fed up, you. When the war gets back on it's feet, I'll need them. The old ones are not portable, do you understand? And I trust the phones even less. Remember the lost attack, when all batteries were isolated... and I was sitting there phoning till I was blue in the face... because ail the cables had been cut. I don't think the official way is going to work. It doesn't work quite so well any more, does it? One has to organize, Wedelmann. That's something I can do well. One needs contacts I've got them. One has to find bypasses, like all the other guys. That I can do, too. As of today. What the hell is going on?! Still busy? How can that be? Wedelmann, I need a completely trustworthy man who can... get equipment and men at home and send them on the double. I'll see to transportation by air back and forth... I've got friends everywhere. I need suggestions. Perhaps Vierbein, NCO Vierbein. He's earned a short leave home a long time ago. He's been doing fine recently, right? But do you think he's the right man for the paper war at home? - Sure, sir. - I'm telling you, if I don't... Free? About time! Would you kindly tell me... who blocked the line for so long with his secret talks? Who? A Captain Witterer! That's very interesting! Now let's see there's lots of room here. Enough for a 100-room castle! Come on, start! Yes, sir. Are you crazy? The snow covered that large hole, there! What, you knew there was a hole? I know all the holes in the neighborhood but the new ones. And you drive into it, you fool? Yes, sir. Every order I'm given is obeyed without reservations! And another thing I wanted to tell you, Wedelmann... We'll soon cross paths with a certain Captain Witterer. the left hand man of the left hand man of a big shot. Nice position! Only, he does not have the makings of a hero. They started the custom of sending everyone to the front. - I didn't ask for him. - And what's he here for? Well, this Captain Witterer your health, Wedelmann... - Your health, sir. - takes over the 3rd battery. My battery? Just kick your old commander in the pants. You assured me that my battery is the best in the department. That's why you're staying with me to make sure the guy... does not mess it up too much. - Yes, but... - Do you understand me? Yes, sir. - Is this the world's ass? - Yes, sir. How're you, you snotty nose? Son of a bitch! What? Don't be angry! That's the only word Olushka knows in German! She doesn't mean it! But you speak German quite well, don't you Matka? I'm child's aunt! Only arrive yesterday. That's good! That's harascho [good]! You aunt... and I uncle, eh? Thanks. - Where's the orderly room? - There, sir. Good! Get me a car, I need to go to the commander, now! Take the car to the orderly room. Baggage to my quarters. Yes, sir. - A lovely man. - Cabbage head! - Full kit march? - Bloody idiot. Nice jalopy! - New? - Yes. Exactly what I can use. Ah, yes! It's bloody cold, isn't it? Yeah! True Benedictine, from France. Right. That's for the artillery? Right. - How much do you get for it? - Nothing. How stupid! You're on a special mission. - So what? - This is for all of us... not only the artillery guys! Listen, the 6-ton truck is and remains for the artillery. Don't take that attitude, man... you were quite normal, and now you play the tough warrior. Not as much as you in the barrack's square. But the damned ammo is more important than enough food! No, but I prefer an empty stomach to a hole in the head! My last offer: a package from the Führer, at your choice. and the six-ton truck for my shop! - Is that your last word? - Yes. Good. Good. Good! You take over the Third Battery. It's the best battery in the section. Thank you, sir, for your special trust. Don't mention it. But talking of trust... trust is the basis of cooperation at the front. - You come from transportation? - Yes, sir. So you know that for every fighting man... there are twelve for supplies and administration. But a battery is good only if everything that happens... is designed for the fighting man. So it was for Wedelmann, and I hope it will be the same. Yes, sir, for me it's an honor to take over this battery. If it's an honor, then I won't worry. Thank you, Captain! Lieutenant Colonel, NCO Vierbein has arrived. Let him in. Come in, NCO! - NCO Vierbein. - Don't talk so much. Put your weapon in the corner. Come here, have a drink, and take a seat. Did First Lieut Wedelmann inform you? Yes, sir. Now pay attention to what I'm going to tell you... If you ever get in difficulties and you can't get out... I've got on this piece of paper... a few names and addresses. Don't lose this note, no one should know about it... and you go to one of these gentlemen... don't get miffed if they are mistrustful at first... and tell them simply that I've sent you... and would like to know if the chimneys are still smoking. Don't look so stupid, Vierbein, it's easy to remember... even if it sounds rather idiotic... the chimneys are still smoking. Yes, sir. Well, have a drink, son. No one comes in unless I'm here, Werktreu. That also applies to you, remember! But you're here! The way you've shaped up, I still can't believe it. How con you stay so thin with all this food...? Thin but busy. I've been looking for you for ten minutes. So have I. We're getting a new battery chief. Oh, really! Nothing can happen to me, with all this storeroom! He seems to be more interested in women! That I can supply too. Seems to hove something very special in mind, in one word... support staff. Already asked me for an especially trustworthy man. - So? I'm one. - Right. I already told him so. Listen, Werktreu... one hand washes the other, Platzek does everything, but not free of charge. I want the new 6-ton truck for the food services. Wedelmann won't allow it. But he will not be in charge any more, Werktreu... one has to know, who holds the power. Capisce? - Special message? - No, heartburn. - What's your name? - Kowalski, sir. - General Kowalski? - Only Kowalski, sir. - I'm asking your rank! - Private, sir. - Why aren't you shaven? - Medical certificate. The Russian climate is not good for my complexion. I'm very tender by Nature, sir. Don't talk nonsense. Come on! To Headquarters. Yes, sir! Shit! Wait here! Hey you. Don't you know Hitler's orders that at the front NCO's have to salute privates? You serf! Always waiting, right? Cold feet, Chauffeur. You black marketeer! Any more ideas for the loss? What's the new chief doing in there? Secret command affairs. Ah, women? None of your business. If the chief gets a pair of broads, I'm responsible. You coolie. If he wants women, they'll be ladies! You won't even be asked! And you? Once you were a sharp slave driver, perhaps. but now you take care of canned food! Cut it out. Those are theater artists, we should offer them something. Ask them, what do they want! If they don't throw you out, you'll get a bottle. Done. Kowalski doesn't get thrown out. Here. Just wait. Excuse me, Lisa, it is shockingly primitive here... but I'll change that You'll be satisfied with me. I'll make you comfortable I'll spoil you no end. Why do you do it, Mr. Witterer? Isn't it obvious? You're here because of me, aren't you? - We hardly know each other. - Yes, sure. We only sow each other once, at some party. I remember exactly... you wanted to do something for the soldiers. ...if possible Army support. And you used your contacts. Your wish is my command. - I'm very grateful. - I'm glad. This will be a great experience for me. I hope so, and insofar as I can do anything... ...it will be done. A kiss...! Good boy! Is this the right place? Did you knock? - You never heard of knocking? - Yeah, I heard of it... ...but I'm slightly out of practice. Then, I would get used to it again, slowly. What can we do for you, Mr...? Kowalski. Bruno Kowalski. Please, Mr Kowalski. May I know which perfume you use? And what else would you like to know? I'm looking for my captain. There's no captain here. Perhaps he's in my bed? I could have a look! - What do you want? - I can well imagine. Not everyone wants what you think. Little do you know, Miss... Charlotte. And my name is Viola. This type of war is what Bruno likes, right? I think so, yes... Excuse me... You know you cannot have gentlemen in your rooms. You didn't knock, did you? He's looking for his captain, who's probably with Lisa. - Bye! - Bye! Round the corner, first door on the right. For you I would even shove! Don't overdo it! These are ladies! Don't be so formal, call me Paul! - What're you doing here? - I wanted to ask... how long do I still have to wait, sir. What do you think you're doing? I'm fed up with your gall! Where do you think you are? In the company of ladies, sir. You better leave and wait till I come out! Yes, at the canteen, so I can have a drink in the meantime. You can't drink, you're the driver. Coffee, sir, to get warm! Have a sip. Greetings from home to the fighting front. Thank you, madam, I'll praise you at the front! Out! You and I are not done yet. Yes, sir. Sorry, Lisa, but the men have become dissolute at the front. It's about time I shape them up a little. Please, have a seat... we won't let this bother us in our nice conversation. Three cherry cakes, 150 gram bread - 15 gram fat are gone. - They're over there. - Oh, yes. - One beer, two coffee. - One moment. Excuse me, could I speak to Miss Ingrid Asch, please? Miss Asch is not here, she's on duty at the BDM. Is Mr. Asch here perhaps? No. He's at a meeting. Can I give him a message? No, please don't. I'll come back later. - Do you know who that was? - Her fiance, I think. - Elisabeth! - Hannes! - I was on my way to you. - Something wrong with Herbert? No, nothing. He sends you his best regards. Thank you. You are on leave? No, on special duty. For leave, Herbert would be first in line. - How... how is he? - Well. We're standing here... why don't you come with me a little way. Herbert said I could describe exactly how his child looks. Like any other baby. Sometimes like Churchill and then Molotov. When it sleeps, it looks just like Herbert though. I love it most when it sleeps. Don't woke it up, it shouldn't see a gun and steel helmet now. - Yes, of course. Forgive me. - You must understand. I really miss Herbert terribly and I'm sick of this damn war. Mr. Vierbein, you're still alive? Or are you a pleasant ghost in the middle of the night? If you'll allow me, I'd like to... You'll get whatever you want. Come in! Or do you still think I bite? Come with me! Take off everything. Don't be coy, throw everything off! Or can't you live without this junk? - I just wanted to. - You never knew what you wanted. Wow, Iron Cross first class! Schulz will be furious! He's only got a service medal. But he polishes it daily! Don't be afraid, he's in the barracks all day, he likes it... he feels he can play the wild man there, as he used to! - It's nice here. - Nice? Well, it depends with whom you live. - Even a grand piano! - Yes, it's not mine... someone left it here. Oh, right... you're a musician. Please play, if you want to, that will put you in the mood! No, I brought you something! With greetings from First Lieutenant Wedelmann. Specially for you! For me? I was so happy that you decided to pay me a visit... and it was Mr. Wedelmann who also thought of me! I've asked you all to come, so that you get to know me! The third battery is considered the best in the section. It should remain like that. I'll do anything I can... to make you the best battery in the whole regiment. But unfortunately discipline in this battery is a catastrophe. I think that the fighting spirit is more important! One is conditioned by the other! Unfortunately, today I have to punish for the first time. - Private Kowalski! - Yes, sir! Private Kowalski. Private Kowalski reporting! I'm punishing Priv. Kowalski with three days in solitary, because he repeatedly acted refractory, provocative and without discipline towards his battery commander. Yes, sir! You were head driver. From now on you carry ammo. Dismissed! The best driver in the battery will be head driver. The best driver in the battery is Kowalski, sir. Not for me! That would leave only Private Damhirsch, sir. - Well, bring him in. - Krause, bring Damhirsch! Yes, sir! Next item: how much fuel have we got? - For 2 or 3 weeks, sir. - Weapons? Full supplies, sir. - Ammunition? - For about four weeks. - Rations? - 2 to 3 months, sir. How can that be? Tomorrow we have beef with dumplings. For Sunday, fresh rolls, and for lunch, duck. All done by my battery Kolhoz. - Your what? - My battery's farm collective. You should see my business. I don't have to do anything! But I will, you can be sure! The captain can always rely on me! Wait here! Come here, you dummy. If you're going to be head driver, you must know. The car is in the stupid habit. - of driving into every hole. - Into a hole? Where else, you idiot? If it doesn't drive into a hole... something's wrong between you and me, of course. - Do I make myself clear? - But that'll cost you! It costs exactly one liter schnapps. You can get it when I'm back as head driver. - Got it? - Got it. Why are you storing so much ammunition? You want it to rot? Ammunition doesn't rot It's stored properly. Have you heard there's a war? What's going on here? Is there no shooting here? No morning and evening greetings? They've no artillery and both infantries lie in dirt holes. It makes no sense to have shoot-outs. Is this a war or are we playing ludo? In any case I would recommend not to take any action... without advising the infantry commander. There can be no doubt in the fighting spirit of our infantry. I will make sure this can soon be said of us, too. I have in my hands the papers of the squadron leaders. Certain changes will be inevitable. Remember that! Goodbye, gentlemen. What do you want here? Private Kowalski reports for punishment. Three days arrest, as of now. Get out, you! - We're not through yet. - Are you nuts? - Have you driven long? - Yes, sir. Damn it, open up hell, I thought you could drive, idiot! Yes, sir. - Damn it! Call that that driving. - Fool! Orderly room! - Captain'? - Another driver. - Kowalski, captain! - No, the best driver! - That's Kowalski, sir. - It's not Kowalski. Yes, sir. What's the matter? There's no fuel, sir. Are you nuts? What now? - I'll go to fetch fuel, sir. - How long will that take? Not long, sir, two or three hours. - You idiot! - Yes, sir! Reporting that I'm not really allowed to drive. How come? The rules say, punishment is to be applied immediately. You won't get out of it, I can promise you that! I wouldn't want it any other way, sir. Better watch the holes! Yes, sir. Wanna talk to the Commander? Just... just like that? You come down from the moon? Don't make stupid jokes, I'm coming from the front. That makes no diff... difference. Aren't I released from general duties? - Why? - Well... I only have my chief's orders as all leaves were cancelled. Dear man, the First Lieutenant will decide about that... I can't do it. Stay put, for a mo... moment. Yes! NCO Vierbein wishes to speak to the First Lieutenant! What, our good old Vierbein? Yes, Vierbein, you old milksop! Do you remember our clumsiest recruit, Frost? Vierbein... and a NCO to boot! And Iron Cross first class? NCO Vierbein, ordered to take personnel and equipment... - to the artillery reserves. - See, Frost, my methods. Yes, sir, superb! What did you get that for? - I knocked out tanks. - How many? Seven. Well, well, seven tanks. So, we licked you into shape, after all! So your education was worth it, wasn't it? You must admit it, Verbein, right? Gimme well, don't you understand, you dolt? Your papers! Your documents! You're carrying out service orders! Come on, man, lay your egg! Sir, I've been expressly ordered... to report my message only to the commander in person. Have you gone up in life! Such a big shot! From a hot dog to a big shot! Yes, superb! Well! In half an hour you report to the commander. Then you'll know what miracles are! Come in! I've been expecting your silly face for half an hour. Come closer! In war, dear Vierbein, the best ones are the achievers. I'm the commander of the reserve section right now The Major has leave, and I'm replacing him in the meantime. Give me your papers. Yes, everything's as it should be. Technically, everything is OK. The equipment is here. But it has not been field tested. - First Lieutenant, sir... - It's quite easy, dear boy. You at the front, nothing goes quickly enough for you. But us here, who aren't lucky enough to be at the front... we must carry out our orders to the last detail. I cannot just supply men and equipment I want to supply trained men and tested material. I'll inform First Lieutenant Colonel von Plönies. If you wont to have him worry, do so, dear Vierbein. By military mail it takes eight days for the Lieutenant Colonel to get this message. By then, the equipment will be tested and the men trained. But I must have the equipment... What you must have, I decide, my dear Vierbein. Understood? You hove been posted here. I'll find an appropriate occupation for you! You can train the men. With the guns! Show what you've learned! And when you're through, you can go off till taps. You'll have enough time to get the shit off you! But take care, my friend! If you get a dose... I'll consider it self-mutilation, understood? - Nice to see you, Mr. Vierbein. - Hello, Mr. Asch. Look, he's got on Iron Cross 1st class. Why didn't you tell? It's not that important! - I think our hero wants a bath. - With pleasure. That's not possible, they've cut off our hot water. Soon they'll cut off the air. But father, you're not wearing your party insignia again. I am, child. Come, help us. We're sticking on these stamps. Stamps! That's idiotic. Can't you think of something better? Sure, eat and drink, whatever you want. I'm for drinking first! Wait here! Where's the food supplies team head? Food supplies... good! Take your hands off the pig when you talk to me! I've asked you a question! Kindly talk German to me! The man is a Hiwi! Platzek is in the pig sty. Super! My God, what a stink! Pig sty third battery, sir! With five pigs and the goat Lisbeth. What a piece of work! The best piece is being worked on, sir! Tonight there's fresh sausage for the artillery position! I didn't come for the menu, but to control operations. And God help you if I catch any irregularities. That doesn't happen with me sir. First Lieutenant Wedelmann wouldn't accept irregularities! The men are very grateful for some variety in their rations. We're not through yet. What's the matter here? Pig's liver, captain, a delicacy! I ordered you to wait, Private Kowalski! I'm waiting, sir, the liver is not yet done. Go to your car this instant and wait there! Yes, sir! Matka, my dove, I'm taking the oven to the car. You don't need me here. There's a Russian woman who speaks German. Natasha? In the house, there. You also deal with Russian women. This is not your usual Russian woman, captain. She is special supplies. Whatever, as long as she speaks German and I learn Russian. It should be the other way round, they should learn German. That's a matter of opinion, sir. Yes, a matter of opinion. But don't let me bother you, Mr. Wedelmann. I have seen your papers! You have a disciplinary transfer in your file. Yes, I trained the men, sir. Perhaps I was a bit tough Major Luschke thought. I should get experience working with material. - Now, I got it. - Come on, sergeant! - Show me your papers, now. - Yes, sir! Son of a bitch! You! You, Natasha? - Yes, sir, I'm Natasha. - May I come in? Please, do. 5000 cans of meat! You don't think I'll cover all that! Why? It shall only get to be a problem if we leave... then you'll need an escort for the field kitchen. A what? That's why I need the 6-ton truck of the ammunition team. You have the largest number of vehicles in the whole battery! But the battery has the most supplies in the division, sir! And I have to have some extras, sir, for bartering! Nothing comes out of nothing! I had to give up 200 kilos of lard... only for that. What do you mean? That's special fare for the captain's ladies. First, the usual: milk chocolate, chocolate with nuts. Bitter chocolate, bonbons, and now my specialty... Crimea champagne, caviar à la Malosol... French perfume... and here silk stockings soft as breath. Superb! It's the mostest, captain! - Who's got the 6-ton truck? - The ammo team, captain. Let's start. That means: would you like a glass of tea? I used to have a samovar. Yes, I know... the Germans requisitioned it. You also had many cups and glasses that the Germans took. Why do you say that? Are you angry at yourself? The Germans probably killed your parents too. That's it. Exactly. - You hate us all, don't you? - No, but how can I love you? Let's talk of something else. As you like. Son of a bitch! - The child likes you. - I can hear it. Can be nice, this son of a bitch, right? That means: war is a great disaster. Look. Are these fit quarters for a battery commander? Oh, God, first we should whitewash it, Captain. That camp bed is impossible! Yes, we'll put in a couch, double width. And a decent cover. Yes, let us say two, sir. - What about the 6-ton truck? - You'll get it. There'll be problems with Asch. Who commands the battery, Asch or I? He needs to be occupied, sir, or he'll look for something. He gets on my nerves. If he gets impertinent... he'll be appointed for special duties. There's no mirror. Mirror, yes... mirror. He's versatile, one could even entrust a brothel to him! - Stop that. - That's good for morale, sir! Just like the dames from Army Support. Dames! Watch your language! Those are ladies. And Asch is exactly the right man for such ladies. Handstand, soap. Yes, handstand, soap, French, yes... That's it, Captain. But I just thought of something, sir. NCO Krause would be good for special duties... he's even a candidate for officer. - Really? - Yes. Must you read the newspaper all evening? What do you want me to do, it's so boring here! What should I say then? At least you have your barracks. In the evening you're always tired. Don't you know that there's a war on? That's the stupidest thing I've heard in a long time! - Lore? - Fritz? - Do you want to? - Yes. What? To get ready for black-out, of course, you idiot! I often dreamed of this. Of what? - Of this. - Shame on you! Why? - Can't you understand me? - Yes. You always sleep on hard ground. It's not that! When we've got time there... we dream of a person who belongs to us completely. - Can you understand? - I understand very well. Marriage is the basis of the state. Yes. But there must be love, too. Of course... that's a prerequisite. - Ingrid, I've missed you so much! - And I've missed you! Ingrid, we have only very little time. When you came, I thought let's go to the Civil Register. Please, please, don't. Hannes, Hannes, please, don't. Everyone's asleep here! Position B, third battery, one NCO and 4 men, no new events. - Where's the observation post? - Straight ahead, Captain. That's where the enemy positions are. Yes, captain. Not very interesting. - They're hibernating, what? - Yes, captain. Man, that can't be. - Have a look, Krause. - Yes, captain. - Don't you see anything? - Nothing in particular. Something's moving in that group of trees, can't you see? I see. Probably someone delivering the food. And the guy goes without taking cover. They always do that, and so do we. Get gun 4 ready for firing. Have you got wax in your ears? Firing position. Fourth cannon, ready for fire. Are you drunk or have you got ants in your pants? All right. 4th gun, out! Alarm! - Do you recognize the target? - I do. Give the firing order! - Are you serious? - Are you stupid? Since when is war a joke? - Wedelmann! - Lieutenant Colonel! The order finally arrived. Secret commando. Retreat from front overnight, without Russians noticing. When? Not yet determined. Presumably in a few days. If the weather stays like this, there'll be no problem. For you and me, but what about Witterer? Wait, someone is shooting! Short! Add 100 yards! 2900, one group. Like a kangaroo. His pants must be full of shit. Yes, captain. Good. Same distance. Three groups. Wipe him out! Go on, until that jumping jack is shot to little pieces! Adelheid 3, yes. For you, sir. The infantry commander. What does he want? He asks who the idiot is that's shooting here? Tell the gentleman to go fuck himself. Captain Witterer says the Major should go fuck himself. I bet it's the infantry commander. Plönies. What did I tell you? Our infantry colleague is a bit enraged. Understandable. The record, come on. Just a moment! But the chimneys are still smoking, aren't they? That's the first reasonable sentence I've heard today. You'll agree that it's idiotic to shoot in this area for no reason at all! In plain daylight. You're right, it's idiotic! Drunk? No, on the contrary, thirsty! Thirsty for fame, and heroics and medals on his chest. Of course I'll keep to our agreement. Yes. And because you're so nice, you can listen to my favorite song. There you are... great. Come here! Special rations! Right away. Please do not be impatient. - You look very nice! - Do you like it? Very much! But come quick, it's cold here. This is a summer dress! Whoever has problems, has booze as well. You have problems? - Is it noticeable? - To a woman. You are a woman? No. You're always just a Soviet Russian. Why must there be war? Without the war, we'd never have met each other! That's a bad excuse. We could hove met during a vacation trip... at a sports event. Do we always have to talk of these things? Time's so short! Do you have to go? Why? That's how it is, in war. Would you miss me? Yes. I'm very happy to hear it. Wrong, you should be unhappy... to have to go. Am I bothering you? - Very much so. - No. I'm sorry, sir, the commander is expecting you. Then you'll have to excuse me, Natasha. Pity. Good-bye, Miss Natasha. You'll come again? - Without fail. - Of course. Come here! Go at once to the Commissioner. Tell him the Germans are planning to retreat secretly. About our wounded and frozen in the field hospital... the captain did not ask once. Stop babbling, Asch! Don't always say everything you think. I'm here because I have to. And you, because you still think you must save Germany! But that guy's here because he wants shooting! He wants to kill people! He doesn't aim at targets... but at people, to kill them. - Only because his shitty... - Shut your trap, Herbert! Now I've said it, I'll keep it shut. You think I'm stupider than I am. I've tested a new method, Lieutenant Colonel. One could call it the knight's move method. Really? One could? You're quite late, First Lieutenant Wedelmann. You'll only be excused if you were with a woman. Then I'm excused, sir. I'm glad. The First Lieutenant learns Russian from a Russian woman. As I said, you're excused, Asch! Sir? Map chart! Are you aware of the effect of your shooting, captain? How should I understand your question, Lieutenant Colonel? Last night, the enemy has moved up artillery... It was to be expected, Lieutenant Colonel. Do you know how many batteries? No, they felt they didn't have to tell us! We can get the information, sir. Really? How? We'll send a reconnaissance troop. What a florid imagination you have! But before I risk my men's lives, I'll try another method. Perhaps we can get the information in a different way. Come here, gentlemen. Well, it works perfectly. Heavy mortar. No one ordered to take cover, Sergeant Asch! That does not require orders! At the barracks. Whoever wants to take cover can go. I'm impressed, Captain I see you're a hero. Slay and see if the enemy deploys artillery and tell me. Yes, Lieutenant Colonel. I'll be there, under cover. Because I'm no hero, you know. Excuse me. And he really stays! Witterer! Stop the heroics! Come here, man, quick! Don't be so desperate for entertainment, Asch. This knight's move was an excellent idea, Lt. Colonel. I didn't ask for your opinion, Asch! As lively as ever! - Fortunately, everything went alright, Witterer. - Yes, sir. Well, captain, I'm waiting for your report. Yes, sir, those guys... Don't say "those guys", please refer to them as "the enemy". The enemy obviously has only mortars. What do you think, Wedelmann? I assume those colleagues of ours won't reveal themselves... by shooting pointlessly. You'll soon be at the front. One of the most dangerous... situations is a tank attack on the gun emplacement. When a gun can't fire any more, the order "full cover" is given. Then everybody races off and takes full cover. Understood? - Vierbein - NCO Vierbein. - Sir. What's going on? Are you asleep or are you training? I'm explaining the order "full cover". Do you want to train the men to be cowards? Sir... at the front... You are not at the front. Get that, you loser. Put some pressure on these men, and suddenly! Well, get going, or what's bothering you? Nothing, sir, but my order... It's under control, man. While you waste your afternoons... we work like crazy to supply the front with material and men. Worry about your job and not mine. You think because of your medal you'll get special treatment? - No, sir. - Well, then, carry on. ♪ Vallerie vallera vallerallala, ♪ ♪ Rosemarie... ♪ - Who are they? - They're off to the front. ♪ Soldiers are soldiers ♪ ♪ in word and in deed ♪ ♪ They don't play dirty tricks ♪ ♪ and only love one girl ♪ ♪ Vallerie vallera vallerallala, ♪ ♪ Rosemarie... ♪ ♪ It's so good to be a soldier, ♪ ♪ Rosemarie ♪ ♪ Not everyday brings sunshine.

You'd like to get a few extra days of leave, what? I've been entrusted by order with a task. Plönies said... that if I had problems, I should talk to the Major. - That's what he said? - Yes, sir. I should tell you from him... the chimneys are still smoking. Well, wait next to the phone in the other room. Yes, sir. Schulz? What? In the middle of the night? Are you mod, Schwitzke? What? Who? The Lieutenant Colonel? Come on, man, put him on! Yes, sir, this is First Lieutenant Schulz... deputy for the reserve section replacing the Commander... Twelve men, First Lieutenant Schulz. And if you dare make the slightest difficulty for me... I'll consider it military subversion and I'll requisition you. And if I requisition you, I'll get you. And then you won't breathe the air of home for a long time. And I'll give you hell... until your ass freezes! Over and out! Yes, Lieutenant Colonel. Yes, Lieutenant Colonel. I'll do whatever I can. Yes, Lieutenant Colonel. Schwitzke, Schwitzke! Draw up immediately a list of twelve eggheads... who can take the radio phones straight to the front. Who? Who, who? Don't ask such a stupid question, who? The guys we want to get rid of! First the guys at the hospital, they need a change of air. And then the very worst. And the loud mouthed ones. Bartsch... Ruhnau, Becker. What? Shit, who cares about Becker's stomach ulcers? 12 men, Schwitzke, a dozen. Do you want to make difficulties, Schwitzke? I think so too. Otherwise you hove breathed the air of home for the last time. And then I'll give you hell... until your ass freezes! Understood? Over and out! A clear case of military subversion! How dare you speak to me like that? You should be ashamed, a so-called First Lieutenant. Why do you always interfere in official matters? You're a pig! Listen, you're going a bit too far! If anyone needs a change of air, it's you! Why me? I've got a dozen men. A pity. 13 is my lucky number. What's going on? No entrance here. I mean it. I'm not allowed entrance, either? If you permit, Sirs, of course, I cannot do otherwise. This barn is the only place where we can have a performance. By the entertainers? Great. Then I'll take everything out. Without the truck we can make dressing rooms for the artists. Yuck! As dressing room only my place is possible, it can be heated. Back there ammunition chief can build a podium, he's carpenter. And I'll distribute the seats. Of course the colleagues from the infantry will be our guests. And the coachmaster can check on the ladies' bodywork. The ladies' toilet will be in my quarters, sir. That's enough. In any case Miss Ebner has to approve of the premises. Amateur! Toilets are important. What if they get stage fright. Miss Ebner best come to my quarters. Kowalski can drive. Yes, Captain. I just want to know what all this rubbish is good for. - This rubbish is just right. - Why? Well, when this is empty, I can load it all. Very discreetly. - Oh, dream on. - No, the dream's already done. Oh, oh! Those two are quite racy. One of them is exactly my size. - How about sizing her up? - Any time. - Have fun! - Whatever else? Yes? May I pay a courtesy call on the ladies? You call this courtesy call? I'm informing you officially, that the captain expects you. - And unofficially? - Don't ask silly questions. Of course you declined. Why should I decline? Oh, a little lady on a big trip, eh? You've got some nerve! I barely know Capt. Witterer neither more nor less than Major Bär and Capt. Burger. Draw up a list and make copies of it... and send the list to all interested parties. Why do you say such things? Because I don't want you to go to the dogs here. What should I do? Stay here, close the door, and write a letter... to your mother. Let's go! I've picked up a chaperone. You're not going alone, Lisa. She's not going at all. Do you want to ruin the tour for this old private? Nonsense. What do you mean by "ruin the tour", Mr Kowalski? Something quite indecent. Come in! The Captain sent me, Miss, you're urgently expected! Miss Ebner stays here. Are you coming? No. You won't let Miss Ebner accept the Captain's invitation? I'll stay here. I've got things to do, preparations... You see. Get lost. - I'll report it to the Captain. - Please, do. Don't you want to come? No. Damned shit! - Is he always so vulgar? - Love does that to him. Miss Ingrid is not here. She's collecting furcoats. - for our soldiers in Russia. - And Mr. Asch? He's at the distribution center for artificial sweetener. Well, tell them that I was here, to say goodbye. I'll tell them. It's back to the front? - Yes. - Oh... good luck! - We didn't see each other much. - I'm sorry. But I had so little time and I thought things'd be different. So did I. I kind of look forward to seeing my comrades again. Oh right, I forgot. You are a hero. Seven tanks. Please, stop. I think of it often enough. The poor guys. You don't have to talk about it. Now they have a new method on the other side... when you sit in your hole and the tanks come... they drive over it and turn and turn till the guy in the hole... Stop it! I'm sorry, I didn't want to talk about it. You still have such fine hands. You wanted to play the piano. You used to play so well in the barracks. Please, play something. - What? - Something nice, as farewell. I can't, I'm sorry, I can't play anymore. A musician's hands are not for guns. When they finally are. Then his hands are no good for music anymore. And for me this was the most essential. The most essential? You must leave? Tonight. Take me with you. I can't. It's too far away. You can if you really love me. Do I mean that much to you? It would mean so much to me. I'll try, Natasha I'll try everything. I'll come see you once more in any case. Stop farting, there are ladies coming! - Really? - Yes. - Hello. - Hello. - Had a good trip? - Yes, a bit cold, though. It's the weather in this area. Capt. Witterer. Welcome to the front, dear ladies. Perhaps a small glass of liquor to get warm? No, first work, then pleasure. Thank you. Perhaps the gentlemen would like a glass? The ladies will want to freshen up, my quarters perhaps? - We're fine. - There's a room for the ladies. Would the ladies wish to go to the rest room? - What sort of bird are you? - A queer one in any case. He's got a position after the war: concierge at a brothel! That's my dream but only in Paris! Please, it's down here. Please. Do you live here, too? Of course! See ya! OK. Major, gentlemen, welcome! So you're the sharpshooter! Show me what you can, then! Perhaps the Major would like a brief sip with me later? Make it a long one. Excuse me, please I want to be sure everything's all right. The auditorium is behind the tarpaulin. Krause'll take you. Please, Major? What's going on here? Dawai, dawai. Get going, get going. Move your asses, the stuff has to be gone by the end of show. You can't do this, Platzek. I can't? I can. You move the front and I move the supplies. But not without marching orders and in the middle of the day. Platzek and marching orders! You 08/15 moron. If it was up to you, we wouldn't have shit to eat. Go... Oh, you're in a rush to get out, what? Man, save your breath and take care of your papers. Go, go... You and your special deals!

At 11:00 pm, the battery commanders come to me. Synchronize watches: it's now 05:25 p.m., on the dot. Yes, sir. I don't want any unnecessary vehicle movements! Yes, sir! - How's the weather? - Starting to thaw. So, too late. As always, everything too late. Your Vierbein, too, is a failure. Look, Lisa, you must leave before Witterer invites you! - Come on, come on! - Must I? Yes, dammit, girl! - Come on, guys, let's go! - Where to, man? - To us. - You're in a hurry! Are you tired? Thirsty? Hungry? Très bon. Well, come on in! - We did a nice job, right? - Superb! We shall see. I propose for Asch to have a little drink with Miss Lisa... I'd rather have something hot. And Miss Charlotte will show me how she hits the high notes. - A request program? - Of course! But not so loud! With coloratura sopranos, one never knows! And what shall we both do? Shall we solve crosswords? You don't take me seriously at all! Be glad, child, otherwise it'd be very dangerous for you! I'm fed up being always so sensible! Who isn't? ♪ Boom, boom!

How long have you been on this tour? It adds up. What'll you do after the war? Get married. - I'm engaged. - To your health, then! Please, Major! She's got a behind like a horse! I like riding. I thought so! This looks like a brothel! You don't do things by halves! That's the way to do things in war. If I had my way, this shit would have stopped long ago! I understand, but you have a Knight's Cross already. It cost me 62 men and a shot in the balls. You can bring your women, I can't do anything to them! - Captain! - What? Where are the ladies? - Gone, sir. - Then I have to... Stay put. Tonight we'll have enough fireworks. "On the way to the front." "My Ingrid." - Everything ready? - Everything ready. Where's Platzek? He went ahead with his food transport. Without an order? He'll hear from me! - He escorts the women, sir! - Ah! - We shall, in three minutes. - In three hours! Who gives the orders here, you or I? The person who sees the situation clearly. You think you're very smart, don't you? Smarter than the people who give the marching orders! And forgot to take the weather into account. Stop it! Shut your impertinent trap! Asch is right, captain. Nothing's going right. Since this morning, it's been thawing. And if it rains shit, we're leaving at 1:00! Understood? Understood! We're not through yet. - Certainly, sir! - The 08/15 shit-boy! Well, war's on again! Yes, staff and directors leave at 01:00, the procession's on! - The roads? - Blocked. At the large junction it can be all muddy. Can! Is! But it may not. Anything else? An NCO from counter intelligence is waiting. - For me? - Yes, sir. Bring him in. All right, Brack, leave us alone. You can come closer... I don't bite, not yet. Well, talk, man! We have spotted a Soviet agent emitter. And? It reported 3 days ago that our front is retreating. - What? Three days ago? - Yes. We only found out today the position of the emitter. And where is it? In the zone of the third battery, sir. You don't say! This cannot be true! - If the Russians really knew... - Lieutenant Colonel, sir. Just a moment. Come with me I'll prove you wrong. Here. Do you hear anything? - Engine noises! - Right. Those are the roods leading to the West. The vehicles are blocked due to the weather. If the Russians knew, they would radio in! And now listen out there. - Do you hear anything? - No. Well, that's the East. That's where the Russian positions are. I know. If what you said before was correct... and I was their commander, I'd attack... now, this minute. Report to all batteries! We remain in our positions! Sit down. Please. In the zone of my third battery are infantry, anti-tank guns, news, tanks. How come you come to me? The chimneys are still smoking. What do you mean? I don't understand. You really don't, sir? So you listen to my telephone conversations? Yours too, Lieutenant Colonel. For whom do you actually work? It gets more mixed all the time. I'm in the service of the Gestapo and the Secret Service. But personally, for the chimneys to go on smoking. What do you expect from me? To put things right without my service having to interfere. You can count on that. I do. Thank you, Lieutenant Colonel. Thank you. I hope we'll stay in touch. So do I, sir. Wedelmann! Sir. At long last. We've packed already... - Where's the emitter? - I don't know. - Spy! - Thief! - I'm a soldier. - So am I. - You're a woman! - Women are soldiers, too. - You lied to me. - Not a single word was a lie. - With your actions. - That's not true! - You know what I've got to do! - Do it! Do it! My life isn't worth anything to me anymore! And mine? We loved each other. And it was forbidden. That's all. Shoot! Start with me! In this country there are 180 million spies! I don't shoot women! You were never part of my life. But you were part of mine, almost. Well? It was true. - A girl? - Yes, sir! It's all clean, this thing. Yes! But I'm ready... to bear any consequences of my behavior. Well, well, you can't go on living, can you? You feel contemptible? You feel guilty for the death of so many soldiers? Yes, sir, that's it. I feel the same way. Lieut Colonel von Plönies feels the same way, old boy. We were a large family, parsons, clerks, officers. All decent people. They lived honestly, sired children, died quietly. I'm the last one. I don't live honestly... didn't sire children... and will not die quietly. The last of the Plönies was done in by the Fatherland. This dishonest war! I hate this war too, sir. And so you'll simply abandon it? You'll shoot yourself? Let them court-martial you? And leave war in the hands of those who love it... This shitty war without honor and without dignity? - Lieutenant Colonel, I... - You stay! You stay with me, with your honest dog-face... and help me, and support me.. so that there's a few men left going against... this stinking, rotten wave! - Have I made myself clear? - Yes, sir! Good. And now we'll go where we're needed. Forward, sir. No, you go behind. That's an order. - A sip of rum? - Sure. If I piss later, we'll have punch! How're things? The Russians push the nearby division. To strangle us. And we don't get to advance a single step here. At the crossroads is a major, he only allows his men to pass. - OK, I'll go forward. - He'll just bawl you out! Major! Major! The General is stuck two kilometers from here! - What General? - Dunno, report immediately! - I? - The major at the crossroads. Damn it! You, there! Report to the First Lieut, crossroads clear of enemies. Super! And now, son, it's my turn. Third battery! Move on! Hannes! - Herbert! - Man! - How was it at home? - Don't ask! Here, Elizabeth sends this. And some snapshots of your child. Thank you very much. What're you doing here, man? - My mission. - Everything's gone by now. The chief is at his new post, waiting for the radios. - Have you got them? - Yes... and 12 men! - Where? - Out there, at the airfield. I have to speak to the commander. Where're you going? To the firing position. - Any cable connections left? - Yes. - Take me with you. - Let's go! At home the violets are blooming! Hannes, it's you! How was it, old boy? Who is that? NCO Vierbein reporting back from the reserves! You're the legendary gunner with the seven tanks? Right on time! We have tank alarm! I must report to the Lt. Colonel that his equipment is here. Bullshit! He's gone. Your equipment is of no use to him. You stay here. Do you see that elevation on the left? Yes, captain. From there you can see all the front if the tanks arrive. You can show what you can do, NCO Vierbein. Gun four, up there. But we cannot get up there with heavy guns! We'll be stuck in the mud! - Then we'll use anti-tanks. - Captain, we captured those. And you know there's not enough ammo for them. Another word and I'll have you court-martialed for cowardice! - But captain... - Stop it! Anti-tanks, forward! Tanks to the right! Three tanks! Five! There, on the right! What are they doing? Playing circus? They turn on our infantry men under cover, to finish them! What are we waiting for? Fire! We only have five rounds! If we miss one round, we're all finished! I ordered fire! Too much to the left! Too much to the right! Still too much to the right! Right! That's the way! Blow them up! There are tanks turning... on our gun positions. - I've got to go there! - He's escaping... Kowalski! Driver! Step on it! Come on, come on! - Change of position? - Yes. - I'll get the trailer! - Come on! That pig! Full cover! Vierbein! Vierbein! Vierbein! Vierbein! Vierbein! Vierbein! Vierbein! Vierbein! Vierbein! On the way to the front My Ingrid. Most people can't get near each other in war time because they are not able to live together... it did not happen only to you and me. But every war comes to an end. And then I'll be on this world for you only. And for our children... I only want girls... because in life they're loved a little more... and have to stand to attention a little less often. Their names will be Katrin, Barbara and Elizabeth. What do you think? I want to have a window... through which one con see all of life... as long as it is without war. We must have such a window in our small apartment... and when we open it, we shall see a garden. as beautiful as the Garden of Eden. Little Katrin will see the flowers... Barbara the butterflies, and Elizabeth the sun. And when there's peace, there shall be much music... and everything will be harmonious... and we'll live together forever and ever, like in fairy tales. Until then, I'll always think of you, wherever I am. Millions live the same life, but they don't speak of it. We are all yearning for a time without war. If you look forward to seeing me again... as much as I do, then everything will be all right. I won't sign... signatures put an end to things. © 1955, 1999 TaurusFilm All Rights Reserved.
