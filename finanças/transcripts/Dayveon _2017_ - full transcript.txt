Stupid house. Look at that stupid tree. Stupid garbage cans. Stupid stones. Stupid concrete. Stupid people. Stupid bike. Stupid sky. Stupid house. Stupid t-shirt. Stupid hands. Everything is stupid. Stupid. That night I fell asleep while playing a game. I was waiting for my brother to come home. It wasn't happening, so I went to bed. Later that night everyone came to my room. Day-Day, Day-Day! Get up ! Your brother got shot. He got shot. Yes, he got shot. Damn, he got shot. In memory of Trevor "T" Buckingham A, of them, three, four... STUPID THINGS What? Yeah, I'm coming.

There is nothing at the moment. What is that ? You know how we do it, man. It's heavy weed. This is what I need. What are you doing? We're waiting for Day-Day, man. Day-Day is in a hurry. He is not here. I'll smash it. He says he's coming. If he comes back, then he's a guy. He keeps his word. He wants to be initiated. I'm going to fuck him straight, straight. It's not too early. Is that that nigga over there? Come here ! What is that ? That nigga is dressed all in red! What are you doing in red? What, what am I doing in red? Are you not in red?

See, over there? Do you see the dog? Aren't you saying hi? See daddy? Hello Darling. Are you okay little guy? Who is it ? Dada. Dada! - Has the night been long? - Yeah, honey. This night job is exhausting me. Dayveon. Day-Day. Did you roll around in the grass, or what? I will be going soon. Okay. There must be lunch left the other day, if you're ever hungry. How much did the milk cost you? Drop it. It's nothing. Ok. So, see you later. Help yourself from the fridge. Okay. Here, darling. Thank you. Are you not eating? Yes, I will eat a little later. I will go and submit my application files. Cool, cool. And there's some stuff left for Dayveon and you, If you are hungry. Okay. Could you hang out with him? He seems to be bored. I'll find something. We'll do something today. OK cool. Get some sleep today. See you later. Damn, those damn nuts are super tight. What did you put them with? Impossible to loosen them. This fund is fucked up. I dunno. I will try this. Maybe it will work. It will work with that. You say you know how to fix cars? Yes sir. What can you do? I can do everything. I am a jack of all trades. You wouldn't be able to change that tire. You wouldn't be able to loosen the nuts. Why is it so long? All that for a tire. The nuts are very tight. Damn, don't you have anything stronger to loosen them? I didn't make it, so I'm trying with this. Take care of yourself, man. We have to move. Tell him we have to get out. Could you loosen them? I don't do that. It's not my job. Tell him to eat. Old people suck. They are too slow. Shit. Pay no attention. - Are you hiring? - No. I don't want this shit out anymore. It stinks. What is this mess ? Cool. By the way, I need something. Go to the pharmacy and take mom's meds. I no longer take out the trash. I have trash juice everywhere. Don't inflate me with the trash. - I'm on the phone. - Nothing to give a fuck. I don't fucking take her out anymore. No, it's okay. Just the meds. I almost got stung by a bee. I have to hang up. Piss off! See you later. The bees sting me, I have trash juice everywhere. You're crazy. What do you mean, am I crazy? It's just a trash can. Then do it. Here, some garbage juice. I have to shower. No, it is especially necessary to clean the tree with all the bees. OK I will do it. But in the meantime, be careful. What are you doing ? What do you mean ? I eat my cereal. Kim made you some eggs. I do not want it. It makes me throw up. So I'm gonna eat them, mate. Must not spoil. You don't know what you're missing. By the way, what did you want to talk to me about yesterday? You're welcome. Its good. Its good ? - It's okay ? - Yeah. Cool. Didn't you tell him? On what ? The gun. My brother's. I didn't tell him anything. But I'll tell him eventually if you don't. It's up to you to manage. You understand ? I will do it. Cool, that's what I want to hear. I was initiated. What did you say ? I was initiated. What are you talking about ? I was initiated. Initiated to what? Initiated by the Bloods. Stop making fun of me. Why am I kidding you? It is true. So, aren't you lying? Why would I lie about this? Very good. Tell me more. Who was it ? It doesn't interest you. It does not interest me ? Damn, I'm asking you because I'm interested. Who was it ? Mook and Country. The two motherfuckers in the street? - What are you laughing at ? - Nothing. Are you having fun? Are you having fun? Do you find that funny? Relax, man. Don't tell my sister. Don't tell Kim. Don't tell Kim. You say that every day. You don't want me to tell Kim about the gun and you don't want me to tell her that you were initiated. Does it make you laugh? Calm down, man. Serious. Damn, it's you who will calm down! What's your problem, man? I don't want you to approach me, understand? Don't fuck with me today. Serious. Calm down ! You're lucky I love your sister. Fool. She hates because I don't want to fuck her anymore. It's that weed too, man. She is too good. Spin. She tried to confuse me. This bitch tried to turn my head around. All bitches do that. Almost all. It's not my thing. Suddenly, I move, I trace. Did you think about it, nigga? It was your girl. Not just a whore. It was your girl. You're not ready for a girl. Pass me the stick, man. Don't change the subject, man. This is serious, shit. - You're in love ? - No, I'm not in love. I don't know what love is. Are you going to shoot yourself for that bitch? Oh no ! She put pressure on you. You shouldn't be tense. It's okay. All I'm gonna do it is to put me well, I will ask myself. Nothing to give a fuck. - Do not take the lead. - It is what I am going to do. From now on. It's good. Are you ready ? - Are you really ready? - Yeah. Time to initiate this nigga. We are ready. What is happening ? Why are you kidding, man? You find that funny, man. I prefer to walk, man. It gets me drunk, this thing. - You hear me, nigga? - What? My leg hurts. I prefer to push this stuff. Where you go ? It's over there. You got a queer bike. - Cappuccino. - My leg hurts. You're just lazy. You have nothing in your leg. Yes, it hurts. You have your bike. Do you know who shot you? Not really. My grandmother filed a complaint with the cops. Still don't know who it is? No. Do you still have the gun? Yes. He is at home. Does your sister know that? No, I didn't tell Kim anything. She would take it from me. - I know you want to shoot with it. - No. Don't you want to shoot? No. You know my situation. You a real chick, man. Guns aren't really my thing at the moment. That's all. Your currency. Get your leg healed. She is healing. - Hi brother. - Hi. - What's your girl's name? - Atteeyona. - What? - Atteeyona. - What? - Atteeyona. Say again. Atteeyona. What? - What? - Atteeyona, brother. Atteeyona. Yeah. Doesn't she have a nickname? Like AT&T? - And your girl? - My girlfriend's name is Cricket. She is too charming! Yo, go ahead! Shit. Watch out ! Move! Where do these bees come from? There's one near your ear. Kill her. Show your bike. Move! Damn it, man. This one is better. Show me. Show me ! We're racing. We're racing. We're racing. We're racing, man. Why do you no longer live with your father? I support my father more. And my mother, she is completely off. Completely crazy. What do you mean ? What do you mean ? After my brother died, she got up in the middle of the night and she was screaming. She was screaming with all her might as if she didn't know what was going on. She kept screaming. Sometimes I have nightmares. What kind of nightmare? My sister and I forgot about him and he's texting us. Like, we forgot to go get it. He keeps texting me. So when I wake up I check my phone. As if I had missed his call. I tell myself he's gonna call or text and tell me it was a big joke. And now it's a mess. We do it like that. Hold on. No, that's how it is. How? 'Or' What ? We do it like that. It's the Blood sign that we're doing in the neighborhood. Ok. Put that one down. Clench your fist a little. And lift one of the fingers. Drop those two. - Like that. - Okay. And then you do that and you fold your arm like that. And you do that. And you put both like that. Like that. Yeah, that's it. You do B-L-O-O... You spell the word Blood. It's not just the "B", it's the whole thing. Take a picture of me, man. Okay. I am a Blood. Show me. - Country! - Day-Day! How are you, nigga? - You took a long time. - Looked. Look, he pees as hard as a cow. He's emptying his entire fleet, brother. This guy has hate. He's thinking about something. Do you have a lighter, man? Yeah. Why did you text me? What did I tell you when I took you with us? If you have a problem, call. If we need something, we'll call you, right? I'm ready for everything. I do not care. Once we're there, you better not cheat. Including ? Yeah. Hide the joint. Nothing to give a fuck. Hide the joint. I need to talk to him. This guy will never hire you. You're wasting your time. It's all bullshit. Do you have any plans for the summer? Not really. Take this. Look, if you don't do anything tomorrow... No. You could come help me. OK what time ? - I can pick you up at 5 a.m. - Yes sir. - Does it suit you? - Yes. Awesome. I will see you tomorrow. 5 hours. - Glad to see you. - Me too. Avoid confusion. Be careful. This plane leaves traces behind. - What? - The lines are coming out of the plane. Do you know what comes out of it? It's not smoke. - What's this ? - Some spaghetti. You really are a phew! They will bump into each other. They are going to have an accident. Check it out. We're going to see a plane crash. They saw it on the radar. - That bastard is coming down, right? - Yeah. They assure, guys. I'm looking for planes. Pass me your cigarette, Blood. Mook, once you get the trick, are you really gonna do it? Well yeah. Everything will be ready soon. - Are we going to move? - Yeah, man. Day and Brayden. Are you ready ? It's time to do some work. Shit ! Damn, I don't have time! It's so funny, man. How the fuck are we gonna move forward if the cash register does this? Shut up or I'll bust you all. He needs an engine at your checkout. I do not believe. I don't see how we're going to move forward... It's okay ? We've been in the car for two hours. We haven't changed our route. Where are we going ? Change your glasses, nigga, your eyes are rotten. Damn, Mook, are you okay? It stinks, that stuff, man. What the fuck is this? Give me a taste, man. Here, Blood. What is this shit? Is it PCP or what? Why PCP? Damn, this is too strong. Dude, what is it? I don't feel it. This is good. Where are we ? What is that thing ? I have never been here. It's cool, man. Relax. Who the fuck is he? I dunno. Get the bags out of the fucking glove box. Nigga, go cover the fucking plates. What do I do with that ? Will cover the plate on the back. What plate, man? That of the cash register! Damn, the license plate! Really a kid, that nigga. Blood, give me the gun in the back. What? The gun under the rug, man. Move on ! Damn, you guys are slow! We're gonna get caught. It's all downright stupid. Really, man. Have you covered the license plate? No one will see her, eh? Watch out and don't move. Ready? Shit ! I have nothing! What was that ? We have nothing! Watch the road, man! Damn, the road! Did you shoot someone? That nigga tried to kill us! He almost shot me in the head! Damn, it's over! This is the last time ! Who did you shoot? I almost got killed! For that slab! Day-Day? It's okay ? Yeah. Come here ! Are you thirsty? Forget it, Kim. I'm taking care of it. What do you want to eat when you're done? I want a sandwich, but I can make it and make it for everyone. Okay. Hey, sister. No nothing. Here, Blood. Not worth it, all that shit. That's why you have to do something with the guys. Hopefully you'll keep me from falling back. Because it's weird outside. I am fed up with all that. But what can I do? I have to feed my kid. Shit. That's crazy. It's hard, man. - I got the light turned off. - What? Your light? I am fed up with all that. Whore. This is crazy stuff, brother. All these fucking bills are piling up. We have to find something. These fucking bills fuck me in the shit. They screw me in the shit. Piss off. What am I going to do? At the same time, I'm here dreaming of chrome rims. You understand ? Looks like you're in another world, man. You understand. Chrome rims. Pass it to me ! Shit ! Damn, man. Too bad, your pass. Too bad. That's crazy. Come on, man. We start on the other side. This is what you thought. You are going nowhere. Brother! You're disgusted. - Where you go ? - I don't know. The joystick is not working well, I think. No, I don't want to hear that. It works well. Not bad. - I let you win. - That's it ! I shoot. Go ahead ! You are disgusted to have missed. Shit. You hate because I win. No, never, man. I want you to win. I beat you like I beat Trevor. Yeah, T, that was my mate. A straight guy. But for real man if you need something or want to talk to me, don't be afraid to come see me. I am here for this. - You understand ? - Yeah. Really. Your brother and I were close. - I know what you got... - I got it! I know we don't... There's nothing we can do about it, but really, if you... Play, man. Look, I like you to be here. I tell myself it's my duty to be there for you, you see? This is what I want. He meant a lot to you. So when you wanna talk to me, come see me and talk to me. Like a big brother, you know? Like to a what? Like a big brother. You will never be my big brother. Really. Come on, man. Calm down. Shut up. Where you go ? D, calm down. Brayden! What's up mate ? And you ? Ready ? Ready for what ? I texted you. I have something to show you. And where are we going? Come on, I have something to show you, it's true. No. I'm not moving. - What do you mean ? - I stay here. Why ? My leg hurt all day. I don't care about your leg. Go get your bike. I don't ride a fucking bike. When I tinker with it, you'll get on it. What are you going to do ? Don't worry. - Brother, I won't ride that bike. - Oh yes ! You're crazy. - Hold it. - That thing? Pushes you. - My knee is going to explode. - What? I don't think it works. I told you. I am a pro. Stop jumping on the bike, man. I try not to fall. You will not fall. We're like brothers. Yeah, brothers. Like Bray and Day. "The palace life of Bray and Day". Better than Zack and Cody. Nigga, we're not in a palace, we're struggling. Yeah. "The district of Day and Bray". "Life in the Day and Bray Quarter". You delusions. What are you doing ? - You leaned over. - No. Get off and walk! Don't give a fuck about those pedals and everything. My legs hurt to pedal for your big ass. You weigh heavier than me with your big head. Did you see your fucking forehead? You're phew. But the girls don't agree. Who ? AT&T? I bet your girl would choose me. One more word and I roll on the grass. - It's finish. - What did you say ? I am not kidding ! With your big head. What was that ? A fucking throw. Look at this ! Looked. Tony Hawk. You hear me ? What are we doing here? - I have something to show you. - What? My balls! Come on, you wanna show me what? For real, that's where Bryan works. What, this shit? No, it's like... Where we crush rocks and other stuff. Here, a ball of earth. I have something to show you. What? Come on, watch. Close your eyes. Turn around. Stop being stupid. - Are you sure you want to see? - Come on. You can open your eyes. What the hell are you doing with this? Get your ass back up there. Shoot once, please. No. Damn, man. Shoot, I know you want to. - No, it's okay. - Come on, shoot. Point it at me. Stop pulling me! I'll aim for the top of that. You see ? The top of what? Shit. Damn it, man. Did it make the same noise with you? No, louder. It was a .357 Magnum. Let me see. Let me see the hole. Were you hit there? Did the bullet go through? No, she blew up my bone. There, I really want to go to Vegas. After that, probably Los Angeles, San Diego, at your mother's house... at your girl. I do not think so. Mook keeps texting me. What is he saying ? He will come and take us. We have to be ready. I'm not moving, man. I'm going nowhere. Me neither. He says he'll be there in ten, fifteen minutes. I won't be ready. I stay here. For real, man, last night it was nonsense. Really anything. Hi, how are you ? What's up ? It's okay ? Guy. Sorry about last night, little brother. I owe you something. Here. What's this ? Take. Do you want to move? Hang out with me a bit. Come on, Day-Day. Bryan? In the bedroom, honey. Hello Darling. It's okay ? You look good. And you, you're all happy. Do you have some good news? I have an interview at the retirement home. It is true ? That's excellent news. I told you you shouldn't worry. It is true. Where are you going ? - At Bird. - At Bird. You wear your beautiful watch. Yes, she will bring me luck. Be careful with the dice. You never know. I'm not going to be a jester. I promise not to overdo it. I am a little late. I should have been there for 30 minutes. Can you pass me the keys? I'll be back in two hours, but don't wait. Cool. You look like a donkey, nigga! It looks like a donkey! How are you going to arm it? Day-Day. You hear me ? Go on and I'll do you like the guys in the park. You hear ? Day-Day, come here. What? You see that ? It's gonna get you some money. I'll teach you how to make money in the streets. That's not cool. Day, go sit on the porch. Country, this little nigga, he's thirteen. What is this madness ? He shouldn't see this. I recognize myself in you, Day-Day. I'm trying to help you. Mook, where are we going? I like you, so I take you under my wing to teach you everything I know. My life is worth it. I don't care what people think of me. From what they say about me of what I do, where I live. I want you to understand. You have to be a man. I don't care if you're 13. I have also been there. I know how it feels to be in pain. My big brother was killed like yours. I found him dead in the woods. That day I bought a gun and I found who did it and I farted their ribs. Always aim for the ribs. It's number 1. I broke the ribs of all the guys in the neighborhood. They had to suffer like me. I teach you that so that these bastards suffer like you. Let no one piss you off. Keep your head up and strong ribs. Keep your head up. And the strong ribs. Come on, let's get started. Sorry to be late. Ready ? I am the fluff. It's nothing. You are sitting there. - D, are you okay, man? - And you, big? - Ray One, hey, man. - How are you ? I see. - Are we good? - Shall we get started? Everybody's got money tonight. I have 100 dollars there. We begin. I bet everything. Place your bets. I take it all. How come ? Listen to me, Day-Day. I want to help you make some money. No one should stop you. We got the hell out of the liquor store. I needed that money, man. It was phew. Do you know anyone there? No. I'll tell you what to do when we get there. So, did you get a job? Yeah, I'm at the factory. - Are they hiring? - No. It is in interim. - Oh, man. - What shit. - They tested your piss? - Yeah. This happened ? Yeah, I work, you see. However, you don't know how to play, man. What do you have ? - Look at him, that one. - Take this. This is how you get your money. This is how we do it. You have to bet everything. I bet $ 100. Go ahead, launch. You just lost $ 100. And no hand on the table. Show your watch. Bet your watch. I want it too. We bet all that money. Go ahead. Shit. Come on. I believe in you. Come on, play. This part could end badly for you. He will free you! Do not do that ! I'm going nowhere. Check this out. Eight. That makes 11. I really like this watch. I'm gonna take it home, man. - Seven! - Shit ! Everything on the table! Put it all on the table! On the ground ! Put the money in the bag! Put your head down or I'll smoke you! Take it all, nigga! Put it all in the bag! Take care of yourself, man! Hurry up, grab the cash. Take it and get out! Whore. What was that ? - My money's gone. - Shit ! Well done, Day-Day. Good game. T where? I keep this. What's this ? Take this stuff. Bring me. You're gonna blow my fucking door. Don't throw the money at me! What's the matter with you ? I have something else to fuck, Day-Day. Take me home. Oh no ! You spend the night with me. You hear ? It's your fucking night. Everything is fine ? Small, how are you? Come here. You bastard. I saw you, man. Do you think I haven't seen you? Whore ! What are you talking about ? Stop being stupid. What's your problem ? Do you think I haven't seen you? - How did you know I was there? - I did not know. Oh yes. You set me up. This is it, eh? - You tricked me? - No, man. I am sure it is! I told you to stay out of this, D. And now you steal from me? Fuck, man! I am sorry. Are you sorry? You're crazy ? You could have been killed! Have you lost your mind, D? - Here, your watch. - I don't care about my watch! I'm sick of your little games. You're gonna give me your gun. Give the. Where is he ? - He's not here anymore. - What do you mean ? Where is he ? Give it to me. - He's not here anymore. - Where is he ? Give the. Give the ! Damn, give me the gun, D! Give it to me ! He is no longer there. What do you mean he's not here anymore? Like my brother. What is this madness ? What the fuck are you talking about? What are you talking about ? Do you think this has something to do with your brother? Is that what you're telling me? All that bullshit? Those guns? That fucking gang? It has nothing to do with your brother. Hold on. Listen to me. Listen. I understand. Listen. Look at me. I understand. No, you don't understand anything. - I understand. - No. Look at me. Listen. Look at me. I said, I got it. I understand. Are we cool? Come here, kid. Come here. I understand. I get it. It will be fine. STUPID THINGS IN MEMORY OF CHARLES COLEMAN
