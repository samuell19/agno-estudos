You seen what I seen and you still want to plan. This ain't Cambridge, astronomer. You can't think your way out of this one. I was one of the first Black doctors to graduate from Cambridge with medical degree. Have I told you that? Well, that's very nice for you... I applied to all the best hospitals in the country. Immediately, I was told there were no positions available. I fought tooth and nail for my education, and yet no one would let me practice it. Finally, I was offered a position by post. Royal physician to King Carol the First of Romania. My name, it reached them somehow. But the color of my skin, it would later seem, had not. Captain Eliot once asked me over dinner what I most desired. I told him I wanted the world to make sense. I need this world to make sense, Mr. Wojchek. This beast-- and mark my words, it is a beast-- deep down, I need it to make sense, too. I need to know why it is the way it is and why it does what it does. And then I will remind the beast that it, like the world, has absolutely no hold over me. And then? And then I want to kill the cursed thing. If we barricade this cabin, we are a day from London with this wind. Can't set more sail, crew what it is. CLEMENS: What, you want us to wait around, eyes in the dark, served up and ready for dinner? WOJCHEK: It ran from our guns in the night. It won't risk an outright attack. -ANNA: Running? -It's... It was not running. (gun clicking) It was rationing. Rationing? (gun racks) One a night. Once we had hit open waters and could no longer make port. It hid below deck, sustaining off Anna until then. But now it has us right where it wants us, doesn't it? Like he said, London's only a day away. It no longer needs us. So we have to kill it before it reaches the coast. ABRAMS: Kill it? We can't even find it. No, we can't. It is why we're to set a trap. We must sink the ship. With him on it. Scuttle the Demeter? Have you gone mad?! CLEMENS: She's right. We set up an ambush and leave it on the sinking ship. Then we can escape on one of the lifeboats. If the course is right, we should be able to make shore. This is my home. And I won't tear her apart for this fucking thing! I grew up on a boat, Mr. Wojchek. Just like this one. My father was a deckhand his whole life. He always told me that the... the ship, the living part, is the men on board. The crews. The stories. Everything else is just timber and nails. No! This is my home. She's mine. It's going to be me. CLEMENS: We barricade the hold, so that he only has one way out on deck. As night falls, Anna will be at the helm. When it comes for her, we'll have a clear shot from the crow's nest. We sink the ship and send the wounded beast to a watery grave. (hissing breath echoing) (ship creaking) (door creaks) ELIOT: 21 July. Fourth August. It dare not touch-- You got to get Toby home. 1830... Captain. No, uh, people need to know. Uh, logs. There needs to be a record. The Demet is lost, sir. We're abandoning ship. Abandoning ship? Aye, sir. Mr. Wojchek's below deck making preparations as we speak. We'll leave the beast a sinking ship as a farewell gift. (gasps) He comes to me. He whispers to me behind my own eyes. He can bring Toby back. He took him away. He can bring him back. Captain, come to your senses. You know that's not possible. Toby... (breathing heavily) Toby. I just need to bring the Demeter to shore. I'm sorry, Mr. Clemens. -No! -ANNA: Captain. -(breath shudders) You have seen him as I have. You know deep down that is not all. (breath shuddering) When I dream, sometimes... I remember who I was. Before him. But most often, I think of the box he kept me in. How every time he came for me and tore into my flesh, drank his fill, dirt would seep into the fresh wound, filling me up. You cannot sink the Demeter. Picture Toby's face. His smile, his laugh. And think of that dirt filling him up, too, because that's what the devil does. He takes what is good and what you love, and he... he uses it, and he twists it, and he rots it from within. Do not let him do that to the memory of your boy. (breath shuddering) ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ I will...
