Think again Ramu. Look Ramu ! No matter how big a man becomes He cannot be bigger than his father. You could not give him any happiness when he was alive, but.. Now do some good by performing his rituals. What happiness I could not give, My father himself was not ready to see my face. Turned away even at the last moment. We have died for them since long. If anyone is left then it is his dear daughter Subhagi. Will do the rituals of his father. That thing is fine, but Ramu, you also have some responsibility, don't you? Enough I know my duty. You go from here. Uhhh! Lets go Subhagi, Subhagi, Your mother is calling you. Mom, What happen Our luck has gone bad daughter. Everything is spoiled. You becomes widow now. Crying.... Mom what is a widow? Crying........ Sister-in-law, Tulsi... Look Life and death are all in the hands of God, Nothing is in the hands of human beings, It was God's will here And no one works before God's will. Everyone who has come into the world has to go one day, keep your heart strong and have courage you have courage and give courage to this girl too. please dont do this have some courage. Ramu ! Ramu ! Today you have come drunk again, where are you going now. Coming back Everyday takes money. Take Tara, I have brought this sweetdish for you eat it quickly otherwise everyone will have to feed it. Eat this. I can't live here, I am suffocating in this house, what I have to do. I have to leave my dear daughter. Leave it now feeling good mom? Now stop this smoking father. Will not leave, will not leave in this birth. they don't care they don't care Subhagi Yes bhabhi Dirty utensils have been kept near the stove since morning, when will you clean them. I will finish all the work in a while, now let me massage to mother. You have been sitting here for hours, then you will say that I used to fill my father's pipe. Just doing this way even if the flies keep buzzing on the utensils. Let's go my daughter but you don't care Come on daughter, let me get the dishes cleaned. No mom no , You will not do any work while I am there, I will do all the work, you sit and rest. I will come now. Subhagi, Wash my clothes too, they are dirty. You can wash your clothes yourself, can't you, brother, or else get them washed from sister-in-law. You don't have any problem in washing mom dads clothes, then what is the problem in washing my clothes? How do you talk brother ? Parents are getting old now, let them rest now. You are getting only this much love, so keep your parents apart and do service, then you will know whether service is sweet or bitter ? Why are you troubling this poor girl? And listen carefully to one thing. As long as I am alive in this house, no one will say anything to this girl. Understand. You have made this innocent girls life difficult? This much love is coming, so keep it tied around your neck, I can't tolerate it. If that's your wish, then fine. Now I call the fraternity and divide. . At least it will be able to breathe in peace? My heart will also feel good. Brother Ramu Listen Subhagi mother Listen to your son. When he was born, we celebrated by borrowing from people. And when the daughter was born, despite having money, did not spend anything. Thought daughter is a stranger that's why didn't spend anything. stranger Dad, I am not a stranger to you, am I ? No daughter, No daughter , No No daughter You are no different from us baby girl! So the point is that Ramu wants to stay aloof. Chief When the children grow up, then the love of the parents starts to bind them. Where did the issue of bondage come from in this? So what's the matter? Sajjan Singh Ji When five utensils start clashing with each other in the house then there is benefit in giving them separately. No son, No This is no Matter When a man walks at the behest of a woman doesn't the utensils or even the walls of the house become enemies? Why do you have trouble living together ? What to tell now, I just know one thing that now we will not be able to live together. You have seen the mood of this boy ! God did bad to my daughter Otherwise, of what use is a field and a house to me? I would have earned and eaten wherever I lived. Father, Father, all these problems are happening because of me, so please separate me By working hard, I will also fill my stomach. I will do whatever I can, I will also serve you, all these problems are happening because of me, so please separate me Yes, I myself do not want to be with you. . It is better to separate than to fight everyday. Wretched, you have eaten your husband too. Daughter in law! Has she spoken wrong, Father is she telling the truth? This girl is lying here only for the farm and the house, Otherwise it would not have gone anywhere else. Brothers and sister, Seeing these conditions, they should be divided. Yes, let the division happen. Thank Yoy So Much Ramu Don't show me your face after today. Hey, what did you bring again? How much buttermilk will you give, I am already drunk. Now drink it well, earlier your mother and sister used to keep it suppressed and when the cow will produce, there will be no shortage of ghee and milk. Then both have fun. did you eat ? You eat first. You have done a very wise thing by taking the decision to stay separate. The truth is that I used to suffocate in that house. I have done it only for your happiness my dear Eat this What a nice food he has cooked, I feel like kissing your hands along with the food. It was fun Cook the same food everyday. You didn't take medicine again today. Daughter ! Medicine test doesn't look good. Yes You get relief from smoking, don't you ? My age has passed while explaining to him. they don't listen to me. Please you do it. I have also spoken thousand times. I'm thinking, buy a cow because I don't like to eat without milk and butter. Till today you have never eaten ghee and milk. Why today? Rampal is selling his cow. But he is asking for ₹ 10000. From where will we get so much money? Don't worry about this I have something and whatever is short, I will take it from Pradhan ji. Okay, If you are saying this then you must be saying something after thinking. Will take bread. No One ? Let the cigarette rest for a while. Hey, you are becoming my mother day by day.

I will not get marry And I swear to you that this will never be discussed again in this house. But Daughter Told that there will be no marriage now All you need is an excuse to cry. How to explain her ? Shiv’s dad , Hmm What thoughts are you in ? Subhagi The poor thing is very unfortunate, she became a widow at a very young age. and the brother also separated But there is one thing, despite suffering so much, she is managing the house alone. She is not unfortunate, she is absolutely a goddess in appearance and character. Hmmm Whichever house she steps into, that house will become heaven. O God, you have shown such bad days, You have given so much sorrow in the fate of my daughter. One trouble after another trouble after one! One trouble after another trouble after one! The son turned out to be worthless. Oh my god ! Oh my god ! What happen what happen Subhagi Subhagi Set fire to it. subhagi Subhagi look what happened to your father ?

When he was completely well you were roaming around as his beloved. As soon as he fell ill, remembered brother. What happen Papa's health is getting very bad. Tell brother to go home. What should I do for so many days you were roaming around like a son, now go and become son! How are you talking brother ? Stop chanting this brother's rosary Go and get the old man treated. That old man and old woman don't seem like anything to you, what should you say brother? The relationship was broken a long time ago when he said in front of everyone that after today don't even show me your face. Dont take the scolding of your parents to heart, he is your father too? So what is my fault in this ? No, it is not your fault, it is the fault of those elders who brought you up and brought you up. The fault is of their faith which they do on you. The fault is of his love, which he has been doing to you since childhood. There is no fault of yours. Listen I don't have time, you go from here and get that old man treated. Okay brother, despite being a daughter, I will also fulfill the duty of a son. Mom Mom you know that the crops have started waving. Small ones have come out. The cow has also started giving milk, now all our debts will be cleared, Mom ? Mom I went to Sarpanch's house to repay the loan. They are very nice people, they don't let me come back without having tea and breakfast. Mom, I am going to the farm Should I ask you something? Did you take money from Sajjan Singh again ? How much Mother, why do you worry when you called me a son, so I had to fulfill the duty of a son too. how much did you take Not much, just some money left which I will pay along with the crop. shall i go now ? Yes daughter and go carefully. I will bring your food in time What happened Shiv's father? what are you thinking about ? I have received a proposal from the Zamindar Lal Singh of the nearby village. For our son ? No , its for Subhagi So Subhagi refuses Than Lalsingh becomes angry and said I am such a big landlord, I have so many fields and land and that 2-kopeck girl refused my proposal. Stupid, she would have been happy if she had got married. Happy ? You have become a fat bull after eating, buffalo, is your intelligence behind ? so what did i say wrong? His boys are spoiled. Keeps chasing after girls. Remains intoxicated with alcohol all day. Are they worth it ? So why are you getting so sad? My These old eyes can no longer see your pain and suffering, daughter. Daughter,please listen to one thing of your old mother. Tell Daughter, fulfill my last wish, get married Mom I am not alone, You are with me. Why do you cry so much? How long will i live. I can understand your sorrow. I can understand But We have such a relation with sorrow like the relation between clothes and body we take off one cloth and wear another, Sorrow is like a cloth, one goes, another comes. When we cannot live without clothes then how can we live without sorrow. You know know that sorrow makes a person strong, it teaches us to struggle. Happiness can deceive a person, but sorrow stays with him as long as a person breathes. Now you tell me how can I cheat this sorrow, you wait, I came after cooking. Mother Mother...... Mother...... Today you also cheated mother, you also cheated Subbu, Make a promise to me that only you will perform my last rites. uncle !
