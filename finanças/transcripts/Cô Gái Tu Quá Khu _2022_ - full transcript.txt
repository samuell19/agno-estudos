What are you doing? Let go of him, you're killing him. Fucking... Hell. You bitch. Oh no... Sir Tung. Let her go. Let her go. Fuck you. Where did you get this necklace? Give it to me. Give it to me. Where did you get this necklace? Let go. Give it back to me. Sir Tung... Give it back to me. Are you OK? Sir... Sir... He's dead. We should go. We should not. I need to save him. Let's go. Stay away. Ms. Kim is coming. Just stay away. Sir... Sir, please wake up. Please don't die. What the hell are you doing? Sir Tung... Sir Tung. Sir Tung. Please don't die. Hands off. Sir. Sir... - Sir... - Oh my Lord... You killed him. It's you. No. Not me. It's you. That's not true. - I didn't do that. - I'll call the police. I'll call the police. Ms. Kim. Ms. Kim. Oh my God, what have you done, Yen? I was scared when she said she would call the police. We are in deep shit now... We should split up. No... No. Why should we split up? Go. Let's go. You need to calm down. Listen to me. No one knows you were here. I will take all the responsibilities. But no one knows you were here either? Let's go. I beg you. Let's go. Yen, listen to me. - We need to go. - Get away from me, as far as possible. When everything is OK, I'll find you. Promise me. Do not look for me. Never. Understand? Promise me? Do it. Now go. Let's leave. GIRL FROM THE PAST [SAIGON, 2022] Maserati, Ms. Q's choice. Cut. Thank you. Fix my make-up. Cà phê Americano cho Ms. Q đây! Thank you, baby boy. The designer has just sent over the sketch for your wedding dress with 360 diamonds studded as you wished. For real? Your husband's work, hello. Also, we've got schedule to see the showhouse at Madam Tran Real Estate tomorrow. Make an appoinment for wedding dress fitting too, will ya? Sure. This number's been calling you nonstop, but hung up everytime I answered. Let me answer then. Jack. Hello? Hello, Ms. Q's talking. Ms. Q... Hello? Hello? You better watch out. Hey, Quyen. Quyen, are you okay? Did you get hurt? I'll take you to the hospital. Call the ambulance. Quick. Are you hurt anywhere? I'm fine. Are you sure? Sure. Should we still go to the hospital for a check-up? Why make such a fuss about it? [One more week to your wedding, right? Wait for all the fun to come.] What's that babe? Nothing really. It's the antifans again... What? Show me. Let me see. Don't bother yourself with this kind of bullshit. Consider it a dream, can you? You'll forget it when you wake up. Hello Doctor. Long time no see. Who wants to see a doctor if everything is okay? How's your baby girl? My little baby? Oh she's a big eater. Have a sit. - Bitch, why come so early? - Maria Maria. Sorry, sorry. Why come so early? Has Quyen not come yet? Not yet. Who's this? Oh, this is Dr. Linh Dan. She's my postpartum psychological counselor. How do you do. Hello. Hello Doctor. In case you need pregnancy crisis care, go to the hospital, I'll do the check-up. How many weeks? I'm not pregnant. My belly is flat, what are you saying? I'm so sorry. Must be too many layers. No worries. Not knowing fashion is not your fault. Let's make the order. Hold on. Let me do the social ritual. Hurry up, I need to go home for breastfeeding. First husband, now child, breastfeeding all the time. You guys have fun yeh, I'll go first. Yes. Such a foul-mouthed woman. But your tummy is huge. You bitch. Call Quyen and ask for her whereabout. Dr... Too busy recently? I read on the news that you're getting married next week, aren't you? Yes. Congratulations. Thank you. How are you? I'm good. Why don't you... I'll call you later. Quyen... Quyen. Been waiting too long? I'm starving. You're paying today? Sorry. Do you have another option? This is the only penthouse here. You have 360 degrees view of the river. Fully furnished? Yes, fully furnished. You can move in right after the wedding. What do you think? Quyen. Oh sis... Excuse me. Oh my... If I knew you're back, I would have brought the wedding invitation for you. No need to. You can just send me a photo for my story. By the way, a customer has put in a deposit for your mansion in Bao Loc. Really? Hey, sis. Oh, Jack? My handsome boy, give me a hug. Congrats to you both. And, you're making more than 5 millions profit out of that mansion. Sis... Wait, which mansion is that? I asked her to find me some mansion to buy. Sis. Remember to find me something. So that we can move in after the wedding. Sure. Jack? - Yes? - Follow me. Losing sleep again? Yes, I was just looking for some medicine. You. You should not rely too much on medicine, it's not good you know? I know. Go to sleep. You have an early flight tomorrow. Babe. Next time wake me up when you can't sleep, yeh? So I can stay awake with you. Go back to sleep now. Ms. Quickie. Quyen. Wake up. Open the door. Why you sleep like a log? Quyen. - Coming. - Quyen. Open the door Ms. Quickie. - What's taking so long? - Quyen. What took you so long? I'm thirsty. Did you die or something? What are you carrying? Someone left you a gift at your front door. It's so heavy. Your million-dollar-wedding is making headlines lately. 1000 guests fly to Phu Quoc and stay in 6-star hotel. How awesome it is getting married to a rich husband. Shut it, Quyen's beauty alone deserves 10 rich husbands. You cut your bullshit. One is enough work for the down low. You're too greedy. Where's my Jack? Jack, Jack? He flew to Phu Quoc. For what? For the wedding setup. God forbids. He's running around taking care of the wedding while... you're here sleeping like a fucking log. Such bliss. Hey, open that thing. Let me do it. How to open this... Move over. You're so useless. For things like this, just... tear it open. Oh my God, the fuck is this? Who'd send such a bizarre painting as a wedding gift? You killed him. It's you. What the fuck, Quyen? Hey... Looking for a female housemaid, 125 dollars per month, room and board included. For real? 125 dollars per month for a housemaid? Why do we bother going to Saigon to work as masseurs then? Don't buy it. But I'm afraid I won't be able to make it in Saigon. Yes, you will. There's a lot of money there. I will earn a lot of money, won't I? I need to collect the fee, everybody. Where do you go, bro? Saigon. Saigon? 3 dollars. Where do you go? Saigon... 3 dollars. Get out. Out. Why you want a fancy ride when you have no money bitch? Let's move. It's Quyen... Is it right? Yes, it is. How did you get here? I went by bus. Did the bus come all the way here? They dropped me off in town. I walked all night to come here. Be quick, you gotta see the Lord. Yes, Lady. The house-keeper, not the Lady. Hey. Be quick. Yes. Come in. Today is the Lady's memorial day. By the way... does anyone know you work here? No, my whole family passed away. I see. In this house... You have to do everything, got it? Yes, I'm willing to work as hard as possible, as long as... Rubbish. All the girls before said the same thing, yet none withstand the first month. Another one? You always employ such unique ones. This one is exactly his taste for country girls. He's so fortunate. Such misfortune. What are you standing there for? Hurry up. Yes. That's the Lady. She's gone for almost 10 years now. An accident at the foot of the mountain pass. The Lord'd been paralyzed ever since. Plus the heart failure. Poor him. How about that man? It's his son, Bach. He lives all the way in Saigon. Only comes back when he's broke. Useless bastard. And the girl... Why are you asking too much? Walk faster. Sir... She is here. Good morning, sir. Got my gift? What do you want? What else would I want if not everything that belongs to me? Where are you then? I want to see you. What's the rush? I'll give you time for better preparation. No need. Let's end this now. Where are you? Speak. Fuck. I said I'll give you 3 days to prepare. 3 days for what? I don't have... Hey. Have you thought carefully about this? We paid a lot of money and had to pull a lot of strings for the land right certificate. Plus another million dollar to get it fixed. Now you want to just leave it? It's also against my will. But something happened... And now I can't sell it. Did Jack change his mind? Let me talk to him. This has nothing to do with him. Come on... Can you try to fix it for me? What you had spent on it I'll give you back. Hold the money talk. What I'm concerned about is reputation. The customer has wired the deposit. They're asking to see it too. How can I just tell them that the deal is off? Sis. You can fix this. Plus I still have a few good pieces of land. Can we show them those instead? Nevermind. Let me work this out... Thank you. I have to leave. I'll be back this weekend. Let me make it up to you with a nice meal. I thought we'd never meet again. I only came back 2 months ago. Then came to work at Madam Tran's agency less than a month ago... but haven't been able to finalize a single deal. I'm afraid she's going to fire me soon. No wonder why I thought I saw a familiar face the other day. Didn't think that was you though. You've changed so much. And you too. Honestly, I saw you too. But we made a promise back then... So I avoided you. And now you intentionally come to see me? Sis. Bach has got out of prison. I know. He sent me this just this morning. Moreover... He's been sending me threatening emails the last few months. At first I only thought it was from the antifans, so I paid no attention to it. But he got worse. [I will ruin your life. You can never escape your past.] [You fucking swindler. The fancy Ms. Q used to be a maid.] [Don't you think your wedding will be the hottest topic?] [You cheap whore. Go die, you fucking whore.] [You fucking swindler. Give me back everything.] [Wait and see you bitch. Revenge is a dish best served cold. Trash.] He even came to my filming set. He wants to ruin everything. Why are you so afraid of such a loser fresh out of prison? If he had the evidence, he'd have come, all in, at you by now. He wouldn't have wasted time just ringing bells like this. Besides, now you are Ms. Q. What could possibly scare you? Am I wrong? And yet he gave me 3 days. To take back what was his. What does he have? That mansion. I'll just give it back to him. Are you sure he'll shut up after you give it back? What else can I do now? I can't just sit there and let he play his game like that. I'm getting married soon. Any kind of drama now will be a media storm. Most important thing is... I don't want my husband to know about my past. This needs to end, the sooner the better. I don't want to have anything to do with that past. I am a part of that past. I'm not talking about you. Do you remember the promise you made to me back then? You said... When everything is OK, you'll find me. Now you're living a queen's life. Yet you don't seem to think of me at all. If I didn't come to you today, you even remember I existed. Let me clean it for you. Where's your house? I'll take you home later. No. I'm not going home. What's up? If I go home, he will... He will... He will... It's alright. It's alright... I'm sorry. Sis... Can you let me stay here, please? Please? This is not my house. Sis... Besides... I'm just a housemaid. Sis... Help me... Please help me. Help me please. I don't wanna go home. Come on. Stop crying. Let me find a way. It's Ms. Kim... If she knew I let you in, we're done. Quyen. Quyen. I'm here. Sis... Sis... Quyen. Sis... Follow me. Yes... The ritual's done. Come help me move the food. Then go clean the floor. Yes. Be quick. Yes madam. I'm sorry. But please look at it from my point of view. The last ten years plus had been tough for me too. I'm just saying. I wouldn't come to you if I were mad at you. Whatever happens... I just want to protect you. Right now the hotshot is we need to find a way to deal with that bastard. No need to. I can deal with this myself. Moreover... I don't want to drag you into such a drama ever again. It's late. Let me take you home. But sis, that bastard Bach... No need to worry. I know what he wants. I've done all the paperwork to give the mansion back to him. When all of this is done, we'll be at peace. Hey gurls. It's rare that Jack is not home. How about a hen party for Quyen? Let's have fun with some more dicks one last time. Let's do it another day. I'm having a meeting with the real estate agency tonight. The hell? Dicks don't wait dude. The fresher, the harder. So eat it while it's still fresh. Wait, why would you go buy houses at night? Or are you going to... Cut the crap! I'm meeting with Ms. Yen from Madam Tran's agency... no guys included. Yen? Sounds like a countryside name, doesn't it? Just an old acquaintance. Then tell her to join. The more the merrier. Is she slutty enough? Get her to join our gang. Someone's calling. Hello? It's hard to reach you. Sorry, I didn't have my phone with me. I've got everything prepared. Where can we meet tomorrow? Meet me at the mansion then. What? Where did you say? The mansion. Don't tell me you forgot how to get there. I just said, see me at the mansion tomorrow afternoon. Hello... Hello... Hello? What's up? Quyen. I gotta go. You guys have fun. What? What's going on? We've only got a few holes left. Hey, biatch. He wants to meet at the mansion. How dare I go back to that place? What if... you just follow his order? Didn't you say you wanted to give him back the mansion? Only then you can get married in peace. Did you? But I'm... Let me go there with you. Don't you worry, okay? Hey, Quyen. That's Quyen. That's Quyen. Quyen's over there. Where? Quyen where? You're mad. Are you mad? Mom... Mom... Step father... What's wrong? He's haunting your dreams now? I would not forget even if I die. Sis. Can we solve this as soon as possible? [Bao Loc - 12.5 miles] It doesn't change much, does it? Why did you have it repaired? Did you plan to sell it? Quyen. Quyen. Are you day-dreaming? Yes? What are you doing? You can read? Yes... Nevermind. Stop cleaning. It's the Lord's bath time. What? What do you mean by bath? This is your first task. Try to do it well, you got it? I got it. If he's not happy, you're fired. Open the door. Ms. Kim, open the door. Ms. Kim... Open it. Ms. Kim... Ms. Kim... Ms. Kim... Ms. Kim... Sir... Are you okay sir? I'm... My apology. Ms. Kim... Fuck. The fuck took you so long? This is me being fastest. Come pay for my taxi. Move the fuck quicker. Got it. Get out. Motherfucker... You locked yourself in this goddamn forest, how the fuck you ran out of money? You have a closet full of money, who are you going to give it to? What's going on? How did you know that? The fuck I don't know in this house. I'm your only son. Can you not take good care of me? How good is good enough? I gave you a house, you pawned it. I gave you a car, you sold it. The only thing left is this house with your mother's shrine. So you haven't touched it, have you? This is an intellectual family. An uncultured addict and gambler like you doesn't belong here. Get out. Sir, please calm down. - Intellectual? - Please calm down. OK. Then why don't the intellectual one give this bastard some money, I'll fuck off immediately. Damn you, old man. You should leave this mansion to me in your will now. In case you suddenly die tomorrow without a single last word. You fucking moron. Fuck. Who knows how much time you have left, yet you keep holding on to your property. Asshole. If I didn't get this mansion, I'll burn it down to the ground. My pill... Fucking dirty old man. Sis... Aren't you hungry? Oh yes... Been too busy cleaning, I forgot my hunger. Let me take your to town and find something to eat yeh. What do you want? I can go myself. Do you know the way? Did you forget that I used to live in the area too? Besides, if you go to town, people will chase after you for photos. You stay here. I'll be quick. So that we can catch him later. What... Who told you to prepare his dinner? I did. What's this? Fish? Oh my God. He never eats fish. Hey, leave it. It's delicious. But you always said that it tasted too fishy for your appetite? She even made soup with it. How tasteless. It's okay to mix up the menu sometimes. I can get bored with your same old dishes. Get your hands off. Leave. Quick. Yes ma'am. Don't force her to do it if she doesn't want to. I'll fire her if she refuses. I didn't hire her just for the household chores. I think you need someone to help you with the work too. Look at yourself. You're too old now. I'll hire someone new then. Nevermind. I'll tell you when I need one. Sir, this girl is not that simple... Please leave. I'm not finished... Just go out. Please eat... But when you finish... Remember to notify me to clean up. Sir... Oh... You haven't left? This is my house. Do I need your permission to stay or go? Sir... Why you are here? My house, my rules. Sir please go out. Or I'll have to call Ms. Kim. Ms. Kim? That lame woman is only a housemaid, just like you. But you're not here only for the chores, are you? Sir, please, don't. Sir, please. Be a good girl. I’m about to become the owner of this house. You better be a good girl. No, sir. Please let me go. No Yen, No. He'll die. He'll die... Leave. Leave. I'm coming. You're fast. You're repairing the house? That's nice. This should cost a lot. Thank you, housemaid. The old man would be very thankful to you if he could come back to life. I bring all the paperwork. I've signed them too. Now you sign them. Then we go to the notary office, and it's done. Why the rush? Sit down. Let's walk down the memory lane for a bit. Why are you not sitting down? Are you scare? I thought after all the terrible things that you'd done, nothing could scare you anymore. Sit. You really want to leave? Yes. Ms. Kim talked to the Lord about firing me. And Bach wouldn't leave me alone. But where will you go? To Saigon. Be a masseur. I'm going with you. Are you mad? I can't even take care of myself, how could I take care of you too? Go back to your mother. Let her care for you. But she's dead. Now I only have you. Ms. Kim... Ms. Kim... Ms. Kim... Sis... I'm coming with you. Stop the nonsense. Sis... Sis what? Stay right there. Ms. Kim... Old man, where's the key of the closet? Tell me. Ms. Kim... Tell me. Or I'll kill... Sir... Are you alright? Stop right there. If you come closer, I'll kill you. Ms. Kim. Ms. Kim. You knew it was me, that was why you pretended to save him at all cost, right? After that, he totally trusted you. And no one could kick you out of this house. Brilliant. I'm meeting you not to reminisce about old time. Besides, I need to go back to Saigon immediately, so would you please... Answer me. How did a housemaid bought a whole villa the moment she set foot in Saigon? And bought all the designer stuff... and the diamonds on your fingers... And the money you used to clear your disgraceful history and join the showbiz? With a maid's salary? No way. Because I saw you seducing my old man in my dreams. You even fooled him into giving you my mom's necklace. Didn't all my dreams come true, you whore? He gave it to me. After I saved him that day. Now he even trusts me more than Ms. Kim. But I feel like something's off about this family. There's always something weird about rich people. Bach was not like that before. It was all my faults. I did his mother wrong. She was so upset she hung herself in the back garden. He resented me so much... that he disappeared. Only came back for his mother's memorial day every year. He ruined everything. He wants me to live in torment because of his mother's death. Quyen... Yes? Will you accept our apology? And... I want to apologize for the other day too. I mistreated you. This... Consider this our apology and also my thank you. For saving my life the other day. Please take it. Please, sir... I can't accept this. Please take it. It comes from the bottom of my heart. I cannot. Take it, to please me. Will you? Quyen... Take it. Are you still nervous around me? From now on, you stay here. You're family, now. Family? Yes. But Ms. Kim... Don't worry. I'll talk to her later. Then... Thank you. I'll take my leave. Wait, Quyen. You know who the thief the other day was, don't you? Please keep it a secret for me. It's too humiliating if anyone found out. He has banned Bach from coming back here. Really? That's good. But there's still Ms. Kim... She's not a problem. I'll replace her as housekeeper sooner or later. You will not go to Saigon anymore then? Why the hell should I go now? From now on... This is my new family. Sis... Those people are luring you. Gosh. Why would they lure me? I'm nothing. Something still feels off... What feels off? How about... We still go to Saigon? Now you have the necklace. You can sell it and we go there. How much can I sell this necklace for? How many days can it feed us there? Who are you talking to? No one. Where did you get that necklace? This... The Lord gave it to me. [A mansion in Bao Loc was on fire, a whole family died] [Bao Loc mansion on fire] If you don't want to take the mansion back now, we'll talk about it later. Call me when you need it. Wait. Do you bring all the paperwork? Of course. Let me see it. Here you are. Fuck. That stupid old man. I'll prepare the document to adopt Quyen as daughter. What? From now on, you should start treating her like family. Oh no... My Lord... About Bach... Don't let him take single step into this house. How come, my Lord? Bach is also your son. I don't have such an imbecile child. Do you know the robber that night was... Then do you know what Quyen's really like? She's just like every other girl. She came in here just for money, I know that. Quyen's not like that. Please leave. You should think twice. She only saved you once. And now you're taking her in as your child. How easy is that? I know what I'm doing. Please leave. I'm not leaving. I can only leave when you wake up. I'm sure... You must be under her spell. Shut up. How dare you talk to me like that? Get out. Wait. Give the closet's key back to me. What do you need? Let me help. Not your responsibility to keep it from now on. What do you mean? I'll hand it to Quyen. Why so? Give it to me. No way. Give it to me. Sir... I said give it to me. Get the lawyer to come here and change my will immediately, you hear me? Do you want to sign now? Fine. Then sign it. We have to go to the notary office quickly before it closes. Who told you I wanted to take this mansion back? Then what do you want? I want you to go through everything you put me through the last 15 years. You put yourself in it. Not me. Fuck. Who then if not you? I wasn't the one who burnt the old man. I didn't kill Ms. Kim. I also didn't burn this house down. You did everything, then blame it all on me. I was jailed because I couldn't prove your existence in this house. Fuck it. No one believed my testimony. I don't have time for this bullshit. You wanna run? Let me go. Look. Look at this. The evidence against you is in my hands now. You can run all you want. Run. Give it to me. For all the years, I want to get hold of this paper even in my dreams. That old bastard's will with your full name on it. Do Hoang Quyen. That's the only thing that could prove that my testimony was right. That you used to live here. And you were the culprit behind all the crimes. Now I've got the evidence, and your life's finished. You can't escape this time. Bach. You need money, don't you? How much do you need? I'll give you all, everything. I don't need your fucking money. This paper is all I need. I'll give you everything that you gave me. You can be Ms. Q in jail, you fucking housemaid. Call the police. Yes, immediately. What's the number? 115, call them. Are you mad? It's 113. Call it. Now. Can you guys stop making such a fuss? She's only been away for a few hours. Away what? I'm sure she's gone missing. Quyen has never been like this. All the messages or calls haven't been seen by her. Definitely gone missing. But I'm very sure I saw her in the bar yesterday. Still on drugs? She said she was meeting Ms. Yen or something from Madam Tran's agency, didn't she? Wait, what? She told me she was going out with you guys? We did, but it was only for a little while and we left early. She had a call and left very suddenly. That must have been that Ms. Yen or something calling. And she completely disappeared after that call. This is too suspicious. Call the police immediately. Yen? There's no one named Yen here. How about Zen? Anyone named Zen? None as well. Could it be another company? There's definitely no zen here, just thunder and storm. She must be an imposter then. She's our prime suspect. She kidnapped Quyen. Doesn't that sound about right? What are you blabbing about? Are you mad? Just a hypothesis for the investigation. I'm leaving now, thank you. Just leave. Leave. Everything almost gone wrong. So lucky I followed you. More like you got me into bigger trouble. Look. You'd just killed him. It's murderer, you understand? He deserved it. Even if you kill me... You won't get a dime. I changed my will, I will leave everything to Quyen. Ungrateful bastard. Quyen... Quyen... Shut up. You wanna die? Stop pretending. Wake up. Old man, wake up. Wake up. Think back on it. He'd already died when we came in. He was the one who killed him. Even so, you should not have killed him. Think about it. We're no longer the silly girls of 15 years ago. We can't just get into trouble, burn a house down and leave. This time you really got me into huge trouble. Yes... I have to call Jack. My phone... Sis... Sis... Sis. Did you say you don't want him to know about your past. Didn't you? Or you want to ruin everything? Quyen. Calm down. I told you, I'll deal with the body. What did you just say? I said I'll deal with the body. Shut up. Stop getting yourself deeper into the trouble. Leave it to me. Quyen. Quyen. Listen to me. No one knows about this. We just need to find a way to hide the body. Shut it. I mean it. No one would care about a loser fresh out of prison. Give me the phone. You can't answer it. Give me my phone. Don't you see it? We just murdered a man. I didn't. You are the one who did it. Give me the phone. The phone. Give me the damn phone. Give it to me. Give it to me. Give it back. What are you doing? I'm helping you. I don't need your help. Sis, Bach has got out of prison. Meet me at the mansion then. You should follow his order. I'll be with you. So it's you... Do you remember the promise you made to me back then? When everything is OK, you'll find me. Now you're living a queen's life. Yet you don't seem to think of me at all. It's you... You set me up. Are you awake? What do you want from me? Nothing. I just want to protect you. Get away from me. You did all of this, didn't you? True. I set it all up. How would you get this mansion without me? Thanks to me, you now live in such wealth, such comfort, free from all the guilts, the threads. It's all thanks to me. What do you want from me? I want nothing. All I wanna do is protect you. Let go of me. Let go of me. Stay still. Sis... I'm sorry. Please let me go. Everything I do, I do it for you. I just want to protect you. Jack? Jack. Help me. Jack. Jack. Shut up. Do you hear it? I hear... nothing. But this place is so creepy. Yes, so scary. Forget it, let's go back. Quyen should not be in there. Are you mad? We went all the way here, at least go in and look for her. You go in then. I'll stay here and guard. All of you can stay in the car. I'll go inside alone. Good idea. I'll go with you. Well then let's go in together. Agreed. - This is frightening... - Wait for me, wait... - It's so dark here. And cold. - Slow down. Stop pulling me you crazy woman. But I'm scared. Ah, it hurts... Stop pulling. Quyen! You scared the shit out of me. Keep your voice down. I was scared. We should split up and search. You guys look around, I'll go inside. Why splitting up? We should go together, I go... You go ahead, ignore her. Aren't you terrified? I am. But it's better than in there. You're crazy. Jack... Jack... Jack... Quyen... Quyen... Let me go. I'm sorry. You're Ms. Q. My most beautiful woman. You have to maintain your celebrity charisma. Your friends are here. I can't let them see you in this horrible state. Trust me. As long as I'm still here, you'll always be beautiful and safe. I'll protect you. Sit still. Sit still. Yen... I'm sorry. I got it. You're the only one that protects me. You finally get it. Promise me now. You'll never leave me. Promise me. I promise... Say it. I'll never leave you... Louder. I promise I'll never leave you. Say it. Say it again. I'll be by your side. Are you hurt? Let me take this off for you. Fuck. Stay still. Stay still. Hello Dr. Linh Dan. I'm Quyen's husband. Quyen came back here last month for a re-examination. She said she got stressed out by the upcoming wedding. She lost sleep due to frequent nightmare. Is that so? Yes... I gave her a new prescription for better sleeping, and also scheduled her follow-up session. But she didn't show up. It looks like she also didn't take the medicine. My God. That's why... What's up? What's wrong with Quyen? She asked me to keep this as a secret though... I don't know if I should tell you. Please tell me. My God... Quyen. You're here. Wait for me... Hold on. I'm sorry. I'm fine. Take this off for me. Yes, yes. Let me take it off. Did you get hurt? I'm totally fine. Let's go then. Let's get out of here. Quyen. I'm here. Nothing is gonna happen to you. Let's go first, I'll explain later. What's wrong? She's back, we can't go this way. Follow me, go. Quyen. Calm down. You need to listen to me. Let's go. Ok, ok. You should sit down here first. Just sit down. What's up? Shouldn't you go with me? It's alright... Just slow down. Jack. It's her. She approached me. She set up the whole thing yet I didn't know anything. It's Yen. She did it. But there's no Yen at all. There is. She's Madam Tran's staff. Right... Give me your phone. I'll tell her to fire her. Give me your phone. Give me your phone. Quyen. There is no one named Yen at Tran's agency. How do you know? Hold on... How did you know about this place? I never told you about this place. Quyen. That's it. It's you... Yen... Then Bach and Tran. You guys are on the same boat. Teamed up to ruin my life. You all want to push me to the edge. It's not what you think Quyen... Hello. She's here, come down here. Eye-opening huh? No one is sincere to you. You know why? Because you had never been sincere to anyone either. Isn't it? It's all because of you. It's because of you that I'd spent the last 15 years living in fear. No one would know about that goddamn past. Why did you comeback? Why did you guys team up to ruin my life? Because I'm always by your side protecting you. You harm me instead. What's the use of knowing now? You're at the dead end. You'll be the headline on tomorrow morning news. Everybody will be surprised, shock, and disappointed knowing who the real Ms. Q is. You'll be the hot topic. But you always want to be the hot topic anyway. Am I right, the Beautiful Murderer? I didn't kill anyone. You did. It's you, not me. It's you. You did it. Quyen. Look. Why did you say there's no Yen? It's Yen. That's her. She's Yen. Quyen. Everything is ruined. Now you need to kill me, and him, to cover up everything. Do it. Do it now. As I used to do it for you. This time I'm not helping you. Do it yourself. Kill. Quyen. Calm down. There's no Yen here. Just me. You'll be in prison if you let us go, got it? From Great Beauty to Great Prisoner. You want it that way? Kill me. No. Kill me. No. Destroy your ugly past. - Shut up. - Kill me. Kill me. - Shut up. - Kill me. - Shut up. - Kill me. Stop it, Quyen. You better die! You better die. Die, bitch. Die. Epic. That's Ms. Q. You are not real. Not real. Jack. Jack. Quyen. Kill me. They deserves it. Bach has got out of prison. Help me. Quyen. Why do you want to kill me? You are not real. I always want to protect you. Fuck off. - I always want to protect you. - Fuck off. - Why do you want to kill me? - Fuck off. Fuck off. Fuck off. Why did you stop using the medicine? I'm pregnant. I'm afraid it will not be good for the baby. What's going on Quyen? I told you... You should not get pregnant while being treated. I'm fine. No you're not. You gotta go back to the medicine. I'll change the prescription. You need to choose between being treated or having a child. You can't have both. Can I choose... the baby? Quyen has had treatment history of schizophrenia when she came here. Schizophrenia? Here's her history of treatment. It was diagnosed that she got very serious mental trauma. Due to being abused by stepfather. And being sexually abused when she was young. Mom. Help me. Let me go. Let me go. Mom. Please let go of me. Mom... Mom... Mom... Why didn't you help me? Mom... Quyen chose to keep the baby and stop the treatment. That's why her condition got worse again. Have you ever heard her mention the name "Yen"? That girl is her imaginary friend. She created Yen. Everything is just an illusion. Yen is not real. Bach is not real. Everything is not real. Just an illusion. Yes, that's it. Baby... It's alright now. It is just a dream. It will all be gone when we wake up. The trial of the famous MC, Hoang Quyen a.k.a Ms. Q... in one of the most followed cases has come to a conclusion. It has been proven that the defendant has a history of schizophrenia and is also in pregnancy therefore, has been spared from all the charges. However, she will be taken into specialised psychological facility for further treatment, away from society. Bang bang bang. You can not do that. [According to WHO, 0.6 to 1.5% of the world's population has schizophrenia,] [65% of which are patients with paranoid symptoms.] [Please take better care of the psychological health] [of the people around you, especially women.]
