Producciones Cinematográficas H.L.F Presents THE FOUR SECRETS - Run, run. Run, he's running away with the gold. - Hurry, he sees you! Hurry, Jim! - Get the machine gun, come on! - Kill him, Richard. - Where's the horse? - Fool, that's another show. - But I want the horse! - Enough, it's bedtime. - No, Mom, it's still early. - It's too late. I'm turning off the TV. - No! A little longer. It's almost over. Just a little longer. - Good night, Chuchu. Good night, Chacha. Good night, Lito. - Go to sleep! Don't cry. - But... But... - Stop nagging, you scaredy-cat. - He's afraid of the dark. - I'm not afraid, but you can't see anything. - Shut up or I'll throw you under the bed. - I'm going to imagine with all my might that I'm a butterfly. I am a butterfly. I'm a butterfly. I am a butterfly. And now, I'll imagine that I'm on the moon. I'm on the moon. I'm on the moon. - A flying saucer is different. How can I imagine a flying saucer? - You must envision it with all your might. - I want to be in my flying saucer. - See? - What a nice hat! - It's not a cap, it's my space helmet. Look, look how I fly! - And me! I want to be something too. - Well, envision it. But envision it really hard. - My Marisol doll. - The bold captain. -My dog Tito. - The dreadful masked one. - Princess Lina. - A space car. - Lots of candy. And kittens. - The enamitronic recorder. - Why don't we envision a trip? - And where can we go at this hour? - All over the world and space, so we learn the mysterious secrets of life. - Yeah, let's go. I want to go in a balloon. - On a balloon we can't get far. - I want to go in a balloon! In a balloon, in a balloon. See? What if it punctures? - Did you see? You can't go in a balloon. - I want to go in a balloon. - Well, fine. You'll go in a balloon, but one with very beautiful colors. - Yeah, yeah. - And a basket so you don't fall off. And lots of little colorful flags. - I like it! Will you come with me? - No, Chuchu. I'll go on a bird. - In a bird? Are you crazy? - In a big, very white bird. - A balloon and now a bird. What kind of trip do you think we're going on? - No, not white. Blue. No, not blue either. Pink, or green. No, purple. - Stop it with the birds! We have to go in my flying saucer. It's space travel! - We could race. - But the flying saucer's the fastest thing there is. - Let's race anyway. Let's see who wins. - Well, okay. That'll convince you. - Great! - You have green hair. - Yes. - Nobody has green hair. - Me, I like it. - It's cute, it's cute! - How far should we race to? - Up to the square. - No, no. It's too close. - Up to the Andes Mountains range. - All the way to the Andes? - Yes. Up to the Aconcagua, round trip. - I accept. Up to the Aconcagua, round trip. - Great! - We'll meet back at the square. - Great! - Whoever gets to the square first, wins. And no cheating. - I want you to have a little basket like me. - Ready! - Ready! - One... two... threeeee! - Lieutenant Tricky, set security controls. Operator Gordon, the coordinates should point to the mountain range. I see an asteroid. Attention! Use atomic buster rocket number three. Aim carefully. Fire! Puahhh! Well done, lieutenant! We've pulverized it. Go ahead. - Operator Gordon, the calculations failed. Check the turbines and flight direction. Lieutenant Tricki, I'm holding you personally responsible. We must get to the square first. Whatever it takes! Go ahead! - How did you get it? I flew much faster. - But you forgot this. - This? What's this? - This, imagination. - This, this. - What's imagination got to do with it? - Indeed, stupid. When we wanted to be on the Aconcagua, we envisioned it and we got there. And when we wanted to go back to the square, we envisioned it and that was it. In half a second. - In half a second. - I'm a conqueror of land and sea. And you, who are you? Answer! - What strange names. And what are you doing up at this hour? - We're going on a trip. - A trip? For heaven's sake! I like it! What region of land or sea do you intend to reach? - Our journey is neither by land nor by sea. We'll go through space in my flying saucer. - In a flying saucer? Are you making fun of me?! - N-No. No, look. - Ah... very clever. Very clever. A bird without wings. - We'll travel through space. We'll lear all the secrets of life. - The secrets of life? Do you even know how many there are? Where are they to be found? Listen carefully. There are four secrets. And the journey is risky and full of dangers. Won't you be afraid? - No, we won't be afraid! - Good. Here are the instructions for the trip. Open it later. Understood? - Understood! - Where are you going? - I want to pee. - Come on, be quick! - Hurry up. We must leave. - Goodbye. I'll wait for your return. - See you back! - Have a good trip! - Are you ready? - We're ready! - Space Lieutenant Mary Lany, activate the turbogenerators. - What's my name? - Cabin Boy Chuck Tracy. Cabin Boy, check the compression latches. - I want to be a captain! - Open the instructions. - Quiet! Whose flying saucer is this? Mine! Who's the captain? Max Blacky the sly. Me. Whose idea was the trip? Mine. This is a very difficult to fly spaceship. I name you my super collaborators. Super Lieutenant Mary Lany and Super Cabin Boy Chuck Tracy. Agreed? - Agreed! - We have to go west. - Super Lieutenant Mary Lany, activate the turbogenerators. Super Cabin Boy Chuck Tracy, check the compression latches. We'll leave immediately. - I want to take my balloon. - And I want to take my bird. - No useless stuff. They take up too much room. - But we can take them. Come, Chuchu. This way they won't take up space. - Let's go! - Super Lieutenant, engage the autopilot. Head West. ♪ On all sides, four guarded secrets. ♪ In the west, the first one, ♪ must be found, they said. ♪ - We need a map. - It's my teacher's. - Here it is.

Put it in this crate and store it. - Look at all the food in there. - This isn't food! - It's all stuff to eat. And very tasty. - Hell no! What we need are vitamins, proteins and all that stuff. - I don't want medicines. - They're not medicines, fool. It's what comes in the food, meat, fruit and milk. - Or in breaded-beef steaks with french fries! - I want chocolate. - Allow him. We have something more important to do. - Super lieutenant, watch the course. - Okay, Captain. We're getting close. - Prepare for landing maneuvers. Attention, attention, all crew. Prepare for landing. Have descent equipment ready. - Can't see a thing. - I don't want to go down. - Should we wait a little while? - It's clearing up. Let's go out. - He's got a pipe. I want to have one. - My equipment is special because I'm the captain. - I want a pipe. - Not even as a joke. I'm the captain. - I don't care, I want a pipe! - I want to go up. - Why don't you use your balloon? Do you like it? - We can't waste any time. We must go west. - To my left is the rising sun. The east. - No, wait! - In front of me then, the south. At my back the north. And to my right the west. It's that way. - There are the rocks. - There's no one there. Come. Come! Don't be afraid. - We should g-go f-find the map. - It's a farmer, Lito. Talk to him. - Hey, mister! Here, sir!

Captain Max Blacky. - Come in, sir. - Go inside? There? - I'll use the electronic super shapechanger. - What happened? What did you do to me? Where are you taking me? I don't want to go to another planet. I must go get the melons! - Calm down, sir. - We just want to ask you something. - Are you Martians? - We're terrestrials. We're on a space mission. - We're seek for the mysterious secrets of life. We left at night. Mom doesn't know at all. - And who controls these devices? - I can do it, but they won't let me. - I'm the pilot. They're my helpers. This flying saucer is the greatest invention in the galaxy. It's faster than a space rocket. It can also move on the ground. And over water. Under water. Up. Down. Turn around. This is the electronic supershapechanger. - Yes! The tequetronic tetematraque. - We brought you in by using it. - And this is the turbine driven transvisualizer. - Yes, the burtine ditherer. - It's for bringing things closer. - This is the magnetic expressometer. - Yes, the express... netic. I know how to use it. - It's used to make things talk. - Things? What things? - Anything. This apple, for example. - Me, me. I want to handle it. - What's up? Why are you staring at me? - What are you going to do with all these gadgets? - We are looking for the first secret. It's called kiñe. - What? - One of life's mysterious secrets. - It's next to those rocks. - I know them like the back of my hand, but there's no secret. - We'll investigate. Super lieutenant, we're moving towards the rocks. - Super Lieutenant, reduce size and penetrate the soil. - Soil, nothing but soil. Dirty soil. - Did you see? There's no secret. - Nothing, there's nothing! - Well, not nothing, this soil is very good for sowing. - I'll go look for the secret. - Chuchu!

Get in. - Will it hold? - Yes, let's go to the flying saucer. Quickly. - I want a mountain. - How are you going to take a mountain? - If I envision it, I can. Right, Chacha? - Don't do it! The earth will be angry. - I want a mountain! The trees said the earth belongs to everyone! - We must leave to look for the second secret. - Take the first secret with you, the wonderful earth. - Do you want to come with us? - Eh... I have to work, like the earth. Otherwise, no wheat, no corn, no fruit. Some other time. - See you soon. Now I'll apply the shapechanger on you. - Where's Chuchu? - There he is. - I want a mountain.

Super Lieutenant Mary Lany, are the automatic route controls set? - Yes, Captain Max Blacky. - Have the coordinates been computer verified? - Yes, Captain Max Blacky. - Radar and correlative sinusoids, do they work? - Yes, Captain Max Blacky. - Then let's eat breaded-beef steaks with eggs and french fries. - Yes! - Super Lieutenant Mary Lany, this is the most delicious ice cream... mmmmm... ...that anyone has ever tasted in our entire galaxy. - Captain Max Blacky, this custard and cream is the most wonderful in all of history. - Why don't you eat now, huh? - Stay calm, rest. - You're to blame! You! I'm going to my mom's! I'm going to my mom's! - We've reached the lake. - I'll give you some tea. Mom always makes it for you. - Will you unstitch my pocket? - Okay, but you'll behave, huh. - Stabilize the southern controls. Right, sir. Derive power sources for the reactors. Roger, sir. Landing brake set. Aye, sir. There's nobody here! - The paper says south of the lake. - It's here. West is too big. Wait, I'm going to explore the territory. - I'm coming. - Oh, it's windy! - It's too windy. - I want the balloon. - This is no time to play. We must find the epu. - I'll look for it with the balloon. - Don't go away! - Let him! If he gets lost, let him be doomed. - Epu! Epu! Epu, Epu. Epu. Epu! - Why are you calling the epu? - Because I want to find it. What are you laughing at? - The epu is all over the place. - And where is the place all over? - Up and down. Here and there. It has no smell, no taste. It has no color. The epu is there and you can't grab it. - I can't see it. - You have to breathe it. When the epu blows I move. And if it doesn't blow, I stay still. Look, look how the epu brings your brothers. - Chacha, Lito! The epu is here, it's here. - It has no smell, no color, no taste. Guess, guesser. - It's the air! - I brought the air to you. Temperature changes make the air move. - I'm not still. - I know. Moving air is called wind. - Hold on, quick! Head to the flying saucer. To the flying saucer! - And if it doesn't blow, I stay still. - Super Cabin Boy, to your post. We're going up. We're at four thousand meters above sea level. - Throughout the atmosphere you will find 3 different zones to travel through. First, the troposphere, where clouds and fog always form, rain, hail, frost, snow, and moving air becomes slow. Higher and higher, always going up! Oxygen is scarce, breathing is difficult. This zone is called the stratosphere. Higher and higher, towards the stars, we enter the ionosphere. - How dark! I can't see a thing! - It is the lack of air. We are at 120,000 meters above sea level. - The ionosphere is so big that nobody knows how high it reaches. - Look, look! Where's he going? - He must be going to the moon. - And how does he breathe? - He carries oxygen, like us. - I want to go to the moon. - This is a flying saucer, and we're on a mission. - I want to go! - No. - I'm going. - Come back! You have no oxygen! You won't be able to breathe! - When I grow up I'm going to take a rocket to the moon! I'm taking a lot of oxygen and I'm not taking you guys! - We have to go back. Hold on for the descent. - Let's return, return to the wind that makes me spin. - And my bird, it wants to fly. ♪ In the air I fly, ♪ and flying I tell everything I see. ♪ I see, I see, I see clouds playing ♪ across the sky until they become a downpour. ♪ In the air I fly and flying ♪ I tell everything I see. ♪ I see some kite going up, it flutters, ♪ flies away and then it sways. ♪ The boat that gets there must return. ♪ Whoever finds it, with so much swaying, ♪ gets lost in the sea. ♪ Only the wind knows where it goes. ♪ In the air I fly and flying ♪ I tell everything I see. ♪ - Let's go back. - I want to take the air with me. - No Chuchu!

It's a mystery. - We're looking for... -It's just that... - It doesn't matter. It's just that... - Quiet! We're looking for the palama. - The palama? - Yes! - So the palama is a secret? Here's all the palama you may want. - I already knew it was the water. - You didn't know at all. - Well, I figured. - Hey, awesome! - Can we enlarge a drop of water? I want to hear what it says. - What does it say? - Quiet. - I don't want to be here. I want to go back to the sea. To the river. Or the lake. - Why don't you want to be here? - Climbing, descending, running, slipping from the well to the waterfall, from the creek to the stream. I want to turn the bend of the pipe, go out through the faucet, I want people to drink me. I want to move turbines. I want to... - It's evaporating! - It's leaving, it's leaving! - I'm leaving.

Some downwards, some upwards, from the east and from the west; the winds, too, blowing and blowing, make them flow. The rotation of the earth diverts the great waters to some place. The heat of the sun, the winds and the rotation make the waters of the sea circulate. - I have fish of thousands of species, animals that no one knows and gardens that always bloom. I have the biggest and the smallest, the most terrible and the invisible, the strangest, the most beautiful, and deep down where the sunlight does not reach, I keep secrets of great value. - Let's go back. - Goodbye guys, I'll keep fishing as long as there are fish. - Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye. - No, don't take it.
