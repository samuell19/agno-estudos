(rock music) Yeah, come on in, let's race. (rock music) I'm getting off here. Who are they? (overlapping talking) Hey, bring me a drink, will you, I'm thirsty. Okay. [Man] Hurry up. (overlapping talking) Well, I'm not bothered. [Man] How can you drink that? Smells good. How is it? Are they done? Ugh, they're horrible. Lovely. (overlapping talking) (dramatic music) (women screaming) (men fighting) Careful, I know karate! (women screaming) Let me go! Let me go, let me go, let me go! (dramatic music) How about it? You'll like it, it'll be fun, okay? Not okay, I wouldn't like it, naughty boy. Why not? (indistinct) Oh come on, it's just once, it'll be lots of fun. [Woman] No, no, no. I've got to go home after we leave here. [Man] How come? No, my mother said. As soon as you leave the beach, you gotta come home. That's a real pity. No, she said I must. Your mother must know my mother. She told me the same thing. You clumsy idiot. (loud whirring and explosion) Help! Help me! Help me. Help. [Ninja] Grab that. Thank you. You alright? I'll help you out. (man screams) (men sparring) Keep your arm straight. Concentrate a bit more. Ow! You're hurting me. (dramatic music) (woman gasps) Huh? Hey! Hey, you okay? (men fighting) (woman screams) [Woman] Let me go, let me go! Get your hands off me! [Ninja] Move it. (tense music) (man gasps) Ah. Come on. (dramatic music) (yelling and fighting) (man yells) Great! This is exactly the woman I've been looking for, to save my daughter. Jenny, come over here. This is a photograph of my daughter, plus a down payment. When you've got her, I'll give you the balance we agreed on. Don't worry about her, I'm sure I can find her and bring her back to you. (serene music) (dramatic music) (Jenny gasps) No, put me down. (picks and shovels digging) That's what I like to see, new faces in the camp. Yeah, Davis will be happy. Everyone, settle down. Back to work, come on. Where are we going? Shh. Down here! (women yelling) Get after her! Run, run! You shut up. I said shut up! You shut up! Shut up, shut up! Come on, be quiet. (dogs barking) (tense music) (woman screams) (dog growling and woman screaming) (tense music) Take your clothes off, hurry! Hurry. Faster. (chuckling) Here. Take those shades off. Put these on, whore. Here. Your turn. (tense music) Hey, what are you staring at Judy, your date? You'll get your chance later. You'll have to take your clothes off and get in line to be assessed. First get those clothes off, come on, hurry up. (guard laughs) Ah, good. Now crawl. Like it, huh? Alright. (woman gasps) (guard laughs) Faster. Come on. Mr. Santana, our big client from the Middle East will arrive soon. He wants 50 female slaves and three for his personal use. One of them Chinese, two western. I think there's no problem. There's plenty of fish in stock this week. Good. However, you've got to be very careful. Don't arouse the suspicions of the local government. Once the government discovers our little operation, such an ideal centralization camp for the white slave trade could be totally destroyed. Don't worry about the secrecy, boss, I've taken care of that. Prisoners sent to this camp mysteriously have their paperwork mislaid. Hmm. I'm still a bit worried. What happens if that doesn't work? Who'd dare do that? We'll terminate them, that's the only way. Right, it's the only way out. (woman talking quietly) These are the new girls, you tell them what to do. Oh, no problem, just leave it to us. Get in. Go on, move it. Get in. There. Right. Hey, are they gone? Hey. Hey, little tramp, get down where you belong. Come on you, get over there, by the wall. And you, sunshine, you can join her. You're not allowed to sleep on my bed, okay? You get on the floor. (women laughing) Hey, huh? Alright, you're looking for trouble, lying there like that. This is the chief's bed, now you get off it. Shut up! You be more polite if you want to talk to me. Who's in charge here, huh? So you want to see the chief so soon after arriving here. Some of us have been here a real long time. I've been here longer than you've been grown up, kiddo. So watch what you say, or are you looking for a fight with me? I'll get you! (women fighting) (indistinct yelling) I'm going to kill you! Ow, alright. Guards coming! Hurry. What's going on? Who started fighting? Fighting, we weren't fighting. That's right, we weren't. You'd better not be fighting. Okay then, let's finish the fight. You can have the chief's bed. Forget about it. I don't want to be the chief. I just want to have some place to sleep in peace. (unsettled music) [Woman] Can't you sleep? Let's have some fun. Hey hey. I heard you fighting. That new girl's really pushing her luck. We'll have a meeting with all the cell chiefs. We'll decide on what to do with her, but we'll teach her a lesson. Today we're going to teach the new girls who's boss around here, okay? Okay, sure, come on. (women fighting) Let me out! (whistle blowing) [Girl] Let go of her. [Woman] Get her! Who does she think she is? Just get her! (women fighting and yelling) (steam hissing) (women yelling) [Guard] Be quiet in here. Hold it, quiet. Here. Give this bowl to Mary, please. No, let her have this one. What are you doing? Please do it. Alright. Helping prisoners who are in for questioning. That won't get you anywhere. Here, this is for you. (quiet music) (dramatic music) Take it. (women digging and panting) Sylvia's such a pretty name. And I can see you're such a pretty girl as well. If you have a problem, you can feel free to tell me. I. Come and sit down here. I want to leave here. I need to go home. My father will get very worried. Can you help me? [Chan] Help you? You see, my father is a very rich man. Is that right? But aren't you happy here? I thought you girls were having a good time (chuckles). How about a little kiss, huh? In there. Hey, how was it? Sylvia. (women digging and panting) Work harder! [Woman] Watch out, look out! If you think I'm going to thank you for that, well then you're wrong. I didn't ask you to. Sorry, I didn't mean that. (Sylvia gasps) Sylvia, I've just realized you're the millionaire's daughter. And you helped me. Let's shake on it. It was a pleasure. Forgive my past behavior. I didn't realize you had such courage. I see I was wrong. To resist these guards takes guts. Not everyone would have done it. No, it's nothing really. It's an old underground drainage system that goes all the way out to the sea from here. No one knows about it. Not even the government knows that this place is in existence. So the government doesn't know that we're prisoners here in this damn hell hole. Mail's here! (women calling excitedly) Wait a minute, wait a minute, I'll call your names out. Here, 308, number 627, there you are. 496. 307, this one's for Wong. Now number, number 103. Miss Wu, number 76, here you are. There you go, now number 78, Miss Wong. Here you are, that's all. If you write a letter to your father, I'll deliver it to him. [Sylvia] Do you think you can? Trust me. (expansive music) [Sylvia Voiceover] Dad, I can't stand it any longer. Please rescue me as soon as possible. Love, Sylvia. Ask Sylvia to be patient. I'll do my best to rescue her. I'll take care of her. Hai! (overlapping talking) [Guard] What's all this noise about? What's going on? [Woman] Someone help me. You there will tell. But it could be serious, she should see a doctor. What did you say? Who the hell do you think you are? Get to work at once. This could be a matter of life and death. Go and get a doctor immediately. Oh, you poor girl. I'm sure she's got appendicitis. We can't operate here! (woman moaning) Take it easy. I've never operated before, and all this equipment's rusty. She needs to go to a hospital. Can't she go? No one can leave the cells. In that case, I'll go to the warden myself. Good idea, let's go. (overlapping yelling) So boss, what do we do now? We can't send her down the mountain, otherwise our secret will be revealed. That's true. It's much too risky to send her away. She's only a prisoner, after all. What does it matter if she dies? Okay, let her die. She's nothing special, anyway. We can't get a high price. Much better idea. We save on the price of the treatment, too. (both laugh) We arrived here together, and now I'm burying her. They don't give a damn about us, they're merciless. This is a living hell. (dramatic music) There they go now, it's like lambs to the slaughter. I won, yeah, this time. Hey, more newcomers. Get in. Take good care of her. Oh, Molly! How come you're here? Sylvia! (Molly crying) (dramatic music) (Jenny gasps) (quiet sawing) Hey. Sylvia, don't do that. The ninjas are really smart. Don't undo the floor, it's all booby trapped. Don't waste your time or your energy. Sylvia. You might as well forget about escaping. Look, there's no way out of here, just forget about it. You'll just get more and more upset, and then you'll break. No one's ever been known to escape from this place and live. Stop it. Stop it. Sylvia, stop it. Martha, my needle broke. What's that? My needle broke, I need another one. You clumsy girl! You do that side. When you come back to the cell tonight, bring some soy sauce, lots of it. What for? You want to drink it? Just do as I ask. Mm hmm. Come on. Time to go to work. Rise and shine. Get a move on. Sylvia, time to get up, come on. She's been sick all night, diarrhea. What's this, someone thinks they can have a day off? Well they can't! (Sylvia groans) She does have a fever. She's not faking it. Have a day off. Sylvia. Yes? You better not give me any trouble, or I'll send you out before you're better. I'll send you down to the mines if you're up to any tricks. (tense music) (Sylvia gasping and moaning) (Sylvia gasps) (tense music) Careful. It hurts! Take care. Mary, Mary, are you alright? Mary. I hate it here, I want to die. I want to die! Stop it, Mary, stop it. I hate it! Stop it, stop crying. [Guard] Hey, what do you think you're doing there? Oh no, no, please stop it. Don't hurt her, don't hurt her. Stop it! Stop it. (Sylvia panting) Faster! It's too hot, they can't take it. Let's finish it. Time to stop for now. Stop work, enough work for today. Keep working, okay girls? Oh, alright. I said stop, can't you hear? Are you deaf? Hey, why do you want to keep on working, huh? Just let me finish my job, it's okay. (tense music) Okay, move it on. Ain't no good playing with him, he cheats. That's okay, here. [Guard] Ready! One, two, one, two, one, two. She's still sleeping like a dog. Sylvia? Sylvia! What the hell did you say, huh? (alarm blaring) Go on, back to your cells. Did you see anybody? Nothing. (dramatic music) She went through here. You go and look, see if she's still inside there. Yes sir. Don't go any further. Stay there and wait. Come on. (tense music) Come on, pour. This kerosine will make her inedibLe unfortunately for us. (tense dramatic music) (Sylvia panting and gasping) (quiet music) (guns firing) Okay, in position. Hold your fire! Mr. Chan. You can't behave like this. She's far too valuable for us. She's one of the three personal slaves. You can't just get rid of her. Get up! Dismissed. Hmm, we'll soon see just how valuable she is. (Sylvia yells) Oh no, let me go! (quiet music) (dramatic music) Time for you to die, lady. (yelling and fighting) Alright, come on. Get along there. (tense music) Got you! Well, so I see, you hide cigarettes. You know the penalty for that, huh? The death sentence. Huh? What? It's only a couple of cigarettes. I know. But it proves you're unreliable. This time it's cigarettes, but the next time what? Drugs, weapons? Oh, please don't kill me. I beg you please don't kill me. I promise I won't do it again. I'll do anything you want. Please, I'll give you money, anything. Please don't kill me. Stop begging. Get up, come on, get up. Oh please, I beg you. - Come on, move. - I promise I'll be good. I'll do anything you want. Hey, take a walk, huh? I understand. You said you'd do anything. Do you still mean that? Yes. Good. What are you doing? Hey, get dressed! Do you think I'd go to all that trouble if all I wanted was a fuck? Here. You know what that is. It gives you mobility. I want you to do something, and I want you to keep it top secret. I want you to get Sylvia out of here damn quick. Of course I will. One, four, six, eight. Look at this. Yeah, she thinks she's so great. Hey, what's all this. Don't know. Sylvia, the officer wants to see you. What for? No. Don't be scared. He isn't so bad. He wants to talk to you, to help you. He really isn't that scary. He's been okay to me. He specifically said he wanted to see you. Look here, it's my own key. My knee hurts. Come on, let's go. Give me the watchtower. (phone rings) Yeah? I understand. How come there are no dogs around? Maybe they know about us, and locked them up. Come on, Sylvia. Hey, the searchlight's not on. Maybe they're sleeping. Where are you taking me? To the chief officer. In the tower? (both gasp) (machine gun firing) Who fired those shots? Warden, when a prisoner goes near the wall, the guards must shoot. That's usually true, but not this time. It was Sylvia Bentley. She's too valuable to us. You can shoot other prisoners, but you know very well she's been sold to the Middle East, don't you. No sir, I didn't. Don't lie to me. I gave instructions for Chan to tell you all. Believe me. I had no idea she was anything special. I think it was a trap, you did it deliberately. You wanted to kill Sylvia, didn't you? Isn't that true? Uh, I don't know. Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt you, but I've just received a letter from the boss, and I almost forgot to give it to you. You can wait outside. - Sir. - Sir. It's excellent, it's very good news indeed. (chuckles) I'm glad. Um, would it be related to the sales of our girls, by chance? Yes, it is. The Middle Eastern client has paid up front and in full. (Chan chuckles) We have the 53 ready? Yes. Now I'm going to give you an order. You look after those girls. They've got to be dolled up and healthy. They've got to be looking first class. Uh, but, sir... He's our best client. If he likes these girls, he'll order some more later. Don't forget that. (women talking and laughing) (women shushing each other) How come you're back? Oh, are you alright? What happened, tell us. It was Mr. Ri, he ordered it. Oh, Mr. Ri. Three of my ninjas are missing. I believe there's someone unusual here, someone harmful to us. If any one of you speak out, your sentence will be cut by half. Sir. Furthermore, 53 of you will be going to the Middle East to live life in a palace, which is better than life here. I hope you will be cooperative, otherwise you'll spend the rest of your lives right here. (women talking) Be quiet, back in line, go on. No comments. (women talking) Stop chattering, be quiet. Who's shouting back there? Huh? (women talking and yelling) (whistle blowing) Dismissed. (women clamoring and whistles blowing) Go on, go on! Get them back to their cells, right now. Go on, go on. Things are going to get worse now, you'll see. There's to be no food until the work's finished. You have to finish this road. There'll be no stopping and no days off, understand? That's an order from Mr. Chan. Hey, hello. Let me do that, let me, huh? Sylvia, let me help you. Hey! Hello! Put an air tube in it, go on. Hello. Hello. (excited music) Come here, come on. Come here. Mm hmm, that's right. Me? Oh, really? You dirty old man, you think I really fancy you? (man stammering) Open up please. Oh, thank you. Hey, wait a minute. Huh? Ew, go on, go. Thanks. 344, what are you doing? Where is Sylvia? Gone to the bathroom. Patty, you let her escape. Find her, find her at once. Nope, not there, next one. (siren wailing) Torture her. (chuckling) Speak up, where's Sylvia? Come on. Come on. (dog barking) Easy there, nice doggy. Steady, hold on. Steady! (dog barking) (overlapping talking) (dog barking) (dog growling and Sylvia yelling) It's stupid to try and escape. The ninjas will capture you if we don't. Why not enjoy life in the Middle East? (laughing) Sorry, this is my fault. Never mind. Sylvia will be going soon. We've got to help her escape. In the Middle East, she'll have nobody. At least here she has us, even if life is hard. (women digging and moaning) Hey, leave her alone, leave her alone. Get back to work, hurry up, come on. Hey, wake up, come on. I said get back to work! Get up! You lazy. Come on. (whip cracking and woman groaning) Come on, back to work. Back to work. (whip cracking) (dramatic music) Bury him, go on, hurry, hurry. We'd better hurry. Good, enough. Alright, we've buried him. Okay, let's go now, but remember, just pretend nothing happened, okay? Just act normal. (rain pouring) (thunder crashing) (Sylvia whimpering) (radio beeping) Get them to fix the road. Right. Hey, hey, he's coming. Right, you better go, I'll stay here. Fine. That's good. Him with me, huh? With me, come on. Good. Hurry, will you? We need more tar. I can't hurry. There's something wrong with this machine here. Don't talk rubbish, you're just lazy. Where's Jenny? Oh, uh, um, she's down there. Right. (mystical music) Come on. (dramatic music) Quick, come here, he's hurt, he's hurt! What happened? Get out of the way, get out of the way, where is he? (Warden yelling and moaning) All the girls will be locked up until further notice. There'll be no food for any of them until we find the culprit! He's in terrible shape, I wish the doctor would hurry up. Most of his skin's got that stuff on it. Isn't there anything more we can do for him? God damn it! We ought to have a doctor on this bastard camp. Right, this is an emergency. Get headquarters to send a helicopter. Yes, I will. Is there anyone here with medical training? Yes, there is. Sylvia and Amy both have. Hey, here. Hey. (Sylvia groaning) He needs a blood transfusion. What's his group? It's a rare one, rhesus negative. I don't know if there are any. Bring all possible donors, we'll check them out when they're here. The one's the closest, but it's not negative. What? This one's not right. The types aren't compatible. Sorry, but thanks anyway. It's Mary. Forget it, he's not having any of it. What's that? I'm ordering you! No! That's not the way to do it. Well, my dear, please spare us a drop of blood. Would you do that? After the way you've treated us all, I don't care if you all rot in hell! Alright, alright, alright. If you do it, you'll get better food from now on, alright? Better food isn't enough. I don't want to do any more physical work here. Hey, you can have days off. And when you do work, it doesn't have to be so hard, huh? Come on. Come on, come on, come on. All of you out. Come on, come on, easy does it, here we go. Hmm. Hey. Alright, we're all ready. (tense music) Hey, his temperature's going up. His pulse is weak. We need outside help. Any news of the helicopter? It shouldn't be long now. (helicopter approaching) (dramatic music) Come on, hurry up. Come on. Hey! (overlapping talking) (overlapping yelling) Come back here! Bitch! You saved my daughter. I'm very grateful to you. And this is what you will receive as your reward. Thank you. Sylvia's now taking a rest in hospital. This is the address. If you have time, go and visit her. She needs a friend like you. Of course, we're already friends. By the way, I've got to go now. Where do you live? My driver can give you a lift. No thanks. (dramatic music) So, the little bitch who ruined my empire is here. I'm going to destroy you and make you die in agony. Hai! (dramatic music) (yelling and fighting) Ow! (heart beating) (tense music) (yelling and fighting) (tense music) (gas hissing) (psychedelic music) (alluring dance music) No, no. (sword drops on floor) Naughty. Hya! (dramatic music) (ninja laughs) (yelling and fighting) (guns firing) It's you. You saved my life. [Mr. Bentley] Jenny. (men fighting and yelling) Yeah! Alright, come on. Hey. Our Father which art in heaven. Come on, hurry up. Take aim. Come on, hurry up, take aim. Get on with it, shoot him. Go on. (indistinct) Shoot now. (tense dramatic music) (ninja yells) (tense dramatic music) (ninja yells) (tense dramatic music) (missile explodes and ninja screams) Well! (flames crackling) (victorious music) Where's Lady Ninja? She went.
