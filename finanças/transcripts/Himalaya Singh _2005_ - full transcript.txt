Are you satisfied with such a life? What are you not satisfied with? That tour fare which costs 9,000 dollars. Do you still care about that 9,000 dollars tour fare? I joined barely a day.

Then, speed up in full force and knock me down with a kick. I won't dodge and you can kick me. -Are you happy with this? -Yes. No way. I'm afraid you'll dodge. If you dodge, I'll fall. I surely won't dodge. I'll be dead if you dodge. Can't you trust me just once? I trust you but I'm really scared. All right. Let's switch. You stand right here. I'll go over there and run over to kick you down. If you dodge, I'll fall. -You wouldn't be so scared then? -Yes. You'd better dodge! Of course. Do you think I'm a fool? Hang in there. Don't die. You can't treat her so nicely after you marry her. Who? -Indian Beauty. -Okay. Thieves! Thieves! Hypnotize me. -I want to go back and meet my wife. -Hypnosis. -Hypnosis... -Not done yet. -Hypnosis... -Thanks. -Hypnosis... -Hypnosis... Not this place.

Is that my junior's son? Your daughter will come in and quarrel with you after ten seconds. Then, she'll run away. You must lock her up. -Dad. -Beauty. Dad. You can't choose my husband for me. This is your destiny! -I want the freedom to love. -This is India! I must marry someone that I love. I shouldn't have sent you to study in England! Dad! Dad! Dad, please! Indian Beauty.

We got lost and missed the tour bus. Our tour bus! -Yes. -Hey! Hey! Wait up! -My friend. -Why do they have coconuts? Why the three of us don't have coconuts? All of them get to sit except us! Did we not pay the tour fare? -Hey, you dropped something! -Hey! You dropped something! -There are lots of money! -Lots of money! Uncle, what should we do with the money? Uncle, what should we do with the money? That depends if we are the good guys or the bad guys. Good guys will return others' belongings. Bad guys will keep it for themselves. We didn't keep the money despite picking it up. It looks like we are not bad guys. Where's the money? Hey, what are you looking for? Do you need help? Answer me! No, thanks. You'd better be! I've been watching you for some time. The three of you are whispering to one another's ears and acting sneakily. Tell me if you need help. I'm the person in charge here! -No, thanks. -Hey, take a shower. Hey, do you want to worship Brahma? Do you want to learn yoga or buy flowers? You're not answering me! Ma'am, just say so if you need help. Are you crazy to carry it by yourself? Come. Let me help you with it. Goodness! It's so heavy! Do you have a death wish?

If Indian Beauty gets married to him, her entire family -will never have peace anymore. -Right. Uncle, is the guy who talked loudly a good guy or a bad guy? Of course he's a good guy. Hey, who did you say is a good guy? I'm talking to you! The three fools with hats! If that's not considered a bad guy, what is it then? Sit down! Next time, don't ever let me hear you say that he's a good guy! -Got it? -I'll beat you if I hear that again! Get out of here! Get out of here! Damn it! He's still a good guy. Is it because of us? Are we not bad enough? Is that why we couldn't make him be one? Why don't we find him a tutor? Why did I ask you to buy the dyes? -I forgot. -I forgot. Check if you've written it down. "Today, we..." Not this. Let me see. This is... "There were three wicked men with many tattoos at the bathhouse." "Draw something to protect ourselves." Draw quickly. Go to the bathhouse after it's done. Take a bath. -Hey, wake up! -What's the matter? Hey! What's going on? I know who we are. Who? Idiots! We're the Japanese triad! Initially, this place was ours. Hey! It's the three of you again?

Yes, there's a bus to the casino every month. It will depart in a minute. Let's go then. So fast? Can't he learn it here? -Hey, the boss has left. -Let's go. He's going for three days.

I became a bad person during the last three days. There's no need to forget the first nine days. Just forget everything. I don't want to stay in your heart. It's enough if only I drink it. You don't have to drink it. Just drink it. Let's forget each other. -This is-- -Stop nagging. Who are you? Do you know how to go to Yoga City? Why do you want to go there? To marry Indian Beauty.

Brahma, please grant my husband wisdom. Brahma, please grant Himalaya Singh wisdom. I'm Peacock, Brahma's messenger. Each of you had an extraordinary adventure in India. I would like to hear your opinions. Let's start with you, the one who lost his memories. Who's the one that lost his memories? That's you. Why me? I don't even know who I am. I have no memory. Without memory, I don't exist. Since I don't exist, why do you bother asking me? Such wise words! What about the one who dreams? Who's the one that dreams? It's me. When I was dreaming, I thought I was awake. When I was awake, I thought I was sleeping. Are you sleeping or awake now? I think I'm awake, but I know that I'm actually dreaming. Such wise words. Himalaya Singh, what about you? Everything is but Brahma's dream. Where did he go? He has been selected as the new messenger for Brahma. Both of you may return to fight for Indian Beauty. Hey, how to solve the Unresolved Mystery? Give us some hints. You shouldn't be asking me. Count on yourselves! -Count on myself? -Count on myself? -I know! -I know! -Ring the bell! -Ring it. -Count on myself! -Count on myself! -Uncle! -Uncle! -Uncle! -Uncle! -Uncle, we saw our tour bus! -Uncle, we saw our tour bus! Take me with you! Take me with you! Beauty! Beauty! Beauty! Go after them! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Help! He has been possessed! I'm Brahma's current messenger, Peacock. Peacock? My mission is to replace you and guard Brahma while he sleeps? If Brahma wakes up, everything in this world will disappear including you and me. All of us live inside Brahma's dream. When he falls asleep again, the world will start all over. From now on, I'll be reading people's wishes to Brahma who's dreaming. If Brahma gets it, that person's dream will come true. -I'm counting on you. -Leave it to me. Anup in Bombay wishes for world peace. A Hong Kong tour guide in Jodhpur wishes to find the four missing tourists. Everyone is here. Gosh, it's a pity those four are still missing. -Hey! -Hey! -Hey! -Hey! -Hey! -Hey! -You're the uncle! -You're the uncle! -Both of you are his nephews! -Both of you are his nephews!

You meditated with the others. Why are you meditating for so long? You're so troublesome. Actually, you're quite awesome. Why don't you be my husband? It's a deal then. This girl and I are pretty interesting. When I thought our relationship just begun, it's actually ending. When I thought it's ending, it's actually the beginning. The King of Yoga of Yoga City wishes to grant Himalaya Singh wisdom to solve the Unresolved Mystery. The snake's head is biting its tail. Head is tail, tail is head. The beginning is the end and the end is the beginning. It means to be indifferent to the beginning or the end. Hey, you're awake? Is the world going to vanish then? I just started. Brahma falls asleep and continues to dream again. The world starts all over again. They are back to the age of the uncivilized again. There is a group of primitives living in this uncivilized world. They don't know how to talk or stand up straight yet. The young primitive men are drilling the wood to start a fire. Unfortunately, they burn themselves instead. The adult primitive rushed in and reprimanded them at once. They mark down this incident by using knotted string as records. Since it has too many knots, the adult primitive forgot the reason for making such a huge knot. Human's memory is unreliable after all. In other place, these two teenagers are falling in love. The woman uses a stick to express her interest. If the man is interested, he'll let the woman hit his head. Then, the woman drags her man home. The primitives' feelings are very direct. The primitive father and daughter are having a walk. They were almost hit by a Velocisaurus. The smart daughter realizes that the standing up posture of the Velocisaurus enables it to run fast. So, she starts to learn how to stand up straight. When the others saw such an interesting behavior, they learn to stand up straight too. They fall down and stand up again. They fall down again after standing up. When these primitives are trying hard to stand up, a primitive at the faraway Himalayas already knows how to stand up. He is able to do the handstand too. Since it's too boring to be by himself, he twists his body in every angle. This is the earliest stage of yoga. This Himalayas' primitive starts to think how this world is formed and how he comes into existence. Then, he tries to communicate with the sky. Om! Don't underestimate the om. In yoga, it represents the beginning of a universe. It holds infinite energy. Go, primitives! -Human's progression depends on you! -Om! Subtitle translation by Angel Choo
