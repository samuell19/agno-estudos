Every day, it was the same. Is there anyone… anyone in my old life who would still talk to me? Wouldn't hang up the phone when I ask for money? And as soon as I got that money, it was gone. And then I needed more. Like that guy in the story. That guy who keeps pushing the rock up the hill, and every time he gets to the top, it rolls straight back down. Every day, I pushed that rock up the hill, and every day, it rolled right back down to the bottom. But I'm here now, and I know that every day can be a fresh start if you want it to. Amen, Jade. Thank you. Good job. Thank you. Darby. Darby, it's your turn. Um, okay. Darby, 11 days. The whole pushing a rock up the hill thing is very moving. I remember the first time I heard you tell that story at the recovery center. What was that, like, two years ago? Fuck you. Honestly, what are we doing here? Sobriety is a battle. It's a daily battle. I know, I've tried. Seven times. The Sobriety Center, Way Forward Recovery Clinic, A Better Tomorrow. NA. But, hey, it's rehab or jail. Darby, I've sat where you're sitting. I told myself the same thing, "Rehab doesn't work." - But... - Excuse me. - Darby, phone for you. - Just a minute, Mike. They said it's urgent. Carry on. Hello. It's Joe. Your mom's in the Lakeview Hospital. She had a brain aneurysm. Doc-Doctor says there's a lot of bleeding in her brain, so they're gonna operate tonight. I know you haven't talked to anyone since you left, but you should call your sister. Devon's at the hospital now. I'll give you her number. - 801-555-0148... - Wait, can you... Wait. 801-555-0148. - You got that? - Yeah. Look, I'm not sure I should even be calling you but I just thought you oughta know. - Joe, we need you. - I'm sorry. I gotta go. Things are crazy here right now. You should call Devon. Yeah. I'm, um… - Promise me you'll call her. - Yeah, I'm going to now. Okay, I'll talk to you later. - Okay, bye. - Bye. You okay? - Darby? - Yeah. Yeah, my mom... I need to make a call. No outgoing calls. You know the rules. My mom is in the hospital. I have to call my sister. Last week you said your mom was in a car accident. Last week I was in detox. Who knows what the fuck I was saying? This is a big thing, Darby. I have to call Dr. Fletcher. What's going on? My mom is in the hospital. He won't let me make a call. Darby, you know the rules. I have to speak with Dr. Fletcher. He's your doctor. Call him. Ben Fletcher. Leave a message. - Tell him that it's urgent. - Hey, Dr. Fletcher. It's Mike from the Center. Can you give me a call when you get this message? Tell him that it's urgent. - It's Friday afternoon. They're... - Go fuck your Friday afternoon. Darby. Jade. Jade. - What? - I need to borrow your phone. I don't have a phone. Sarah told me that you let her call her kids yesterday. If you don't give it to me, I'm gonna tell Dr. Bill his perfect patient has a phone. And then no one gets to make calls. I'm doing this program at the Center here. It's actually going really well. I just... You need to call them and tell them what's going on, so I can come and see Mom. That's not a good idea. You should stay where you are. You call them. It'll be fine. Jesus, Darby. I'm not bailing you out of rehab. I've got enough problems with Mom in the hospital. Fuck. I told Joe not to look for you. No one has time for your bullshit right now. - Mom could die. - Devon. Don't call me back. Come on. Hey, Mikey, can you give me a hand with Susan? What's the problem? She said she had a nightmare. Now she won't get back in bed. Roaming the halls. Okay, hold on. Keys, keys. One day at a time, huh, Mikey? This is Devon. Leave a message. It's me. I'll be in Salt Lake by morning. Call me back, Devon. I need to know how Mom is. Weather alert. Incident ahead. Expect delays. Exit right towards Route 50. This is Devon. Leave... Oh, God! Someone, please... Please help me! You okay, ma'am? I... I just... I pulled over for a break. I think I must've fallen asleep. Not the best place for a nap. Yeah, I know. I'll get... I'll get going. No, you won't. The road's closed. Interstate's closed too. This storm's just getting started. My mom is in the hospital. I have to get to Salt Lake City. No one's getting through until the storm passes. You got two choices. You can either head back down, or I opened up the Visitors' Center for some folks. It's a few hundred yards up the road. You can wait it out there. Ma'am, you need to decide now. Uh… I'll... I'll go to the Visitors' Center. And when you get there, you stop. Promise me you won't drive on. You won't get through. I don't wanna find your car under a snowbank in the morning, okay? Okay. Shut the door, hon. You're letting in the cold. Bathroom? Back around the map. I told you we should have stayed on the interstate. You heard what that cop said. We can always head back out the mountain. I can't believe… Anyway, you go back down, you'll change your mind. Anybody in there? Do you have the Wi-Fi? Excuse me. Mm-mmm. No, there's no Wi-Fi. Storm's on top of us now. Well? I got one bar by the tree for about ten seconds. Which tree? Muir Tree. The tree in the middle of the lot. I'm here. I'm here. Fuck. I'm gonna get you out, okay? I promise, okay? Come on, come on. Shit. Leaving already? No, I-I forgot something in my car. Yeah, you were out here so long, I thought maybe you got some service. No, nothing. Hey. Hey, are you okay? Yeah. Why don't you come on over here and sit down? Make yourself comfortable. We are here till the storm clears. And then some. So what's your name? Darby. I'm Sandi. Ed. And what's your name, son? What's your name? Lars. Was I snoring? I was snoring, wasn't I? Yeah. Place sure filled up. And what about you? What's your name? Oh. I'm Ash. Sandi, Ed, Darby and Lars. Anybody wanna play? You can't wait? We're stuck here. Seven Card Stud. Quarter a hand? I don't gamble. That's smart. What about you, Ash? Oh, I'm not too good at poker. Perfect. Wanna play? Got a lot of time. I got a game everyone could play. What's that? Bullshit. Bullshit? Yeah, Bullshit. It's the best game. Okay. I'll try anything once. - Really? - Yeah, come on. Okay. - Sandi. You in? - Fine. But aren't you scared you're gonna lose? You know I can see right through your bullshit. - Oh! - Your game, your deal, Mr. Bullshit. How do we play this thing? Well, it's pretty simple. I divide the cards evenly between everyone, then the person to the left of the dealer puts a card facedown on the table. They say what it is, but none of us can see it 'cause it's facedown. The next person's gotta put a card down on top of that, that's either the same value, one higher or one lower. Suits don't matter. So, if I put down a two, the next person's gotta put down a two, a three or an ace. And all the cards are always facedown, so we either gotta take each other's word for it, or if you think someone's lying, you call, "Bullshit!" Then what? That depends. Um, if you call bullshit, the person's gotta show the card they put down. If they were lying, they gotta pick up all the cards on the table. But if they weren't lying, the person who called bullshit has to pick up all the cards. First person to get rid of all their cards wins. Ten cards each leaves two in the middle. Facedown. Sure we don't wanna make this interesting? Well, it's a friendly game. Let's keep it that way. Left of the dealer goes first. Jack. So, where's everyone from? Jack. Um, Lower Haight. It's right next to San Fran. San Jose. Jack. Jack. Oh, four in a row to start a game? - They got a name for that? - Yeah, bullshitter's row. That's not a thing. Queen. - Jack. - Bullshit! Jacks are out. - Ooh! - Hmm. If you had two Jacks, you should've put them both down. I just did. But the same time. Hmm. Is that the rule? No, doesn't... No, you don't... I guess you don't have to. It's your turn. Six. - Seven. - Two eights. So, Lars, you didn't say where... Where are you from? Battle Mountain. Where is that? Two nines. - Bullshit. - Goddamn it. You cleared your throat. Everybody's got a tell. Trick is, play the man, not the hand. Everybody's got a tell, huh? What's yours? You're gonna have to figure that one out for yourself. Two sixes. Where you from? Sacramento. Five. So you're a big poker guy, huh? Four. Guilty. Picked it up in the service. Two fives. - Four. - You're in the army? Marines. 22nd MEU. My dad was a marine. Yeah? Where'd he serve? Uh, Third Battalion, First Marines. Fallujah? Yeah. Some hard fighting. Were you there? No. I stopped after Desert Storm. Well, thank you for your service, really. And your dad too. Okay, everyone always says that, and it sounds about as empty as "thoughts and prayers." Babe. Look, nobody knows what you sacrificed, Ed. - It's okay. - I didn't mean to offend. - I'm sorry. I... Really. - No offense taken. Did you ever kill anyone? Jesus. What? I lost count. Just kidding. Whoa. Your turn, Darby. Three. So, where's everyone headed? Two twos. Ah, Reno. Yeah, Sandi here surprised me with a little vacation to my favorite city. Reno's your favorite city? Yeah, all the action of Vegas, half the noise. Ace. Ace. And you, Darby? - Two twos. - Uh. Three. Salt Lake. Four. What's in Salt Lake? My mom's in the hospital. Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that. Sandi's a nurse. Was a nurse. - Two fives. - Bullshit. Goddamn it. Told ya. I go through Salt Lake on my way home. Where's home? My parents live in Johnstown, near Denver. Hmm, that's a long drive. Queen. King. - Bullshit. - Bullshit. Nine. Um, Lars, so where you headed? Uh… - I'm headed home. - Ten. Battle Mountain? Yeah. Yes, middle of Nevada. Ed, are you gonna play or what? Two nines. Three tens. Damn. Bullshit. Mm-mmm. Ooh. Screwed in your own game. That's a bad beat. Fuck that! - Whoa. Hey, buddy. - Hey, hey. Relax. We playing 52 Pickup now? That's not... Don't... That's not funny. Don't... Don't... Don't make fun of me. No one's laughing. Yeah, I'm sorry. I... Ugh, sometimes I just... Sorry. Sorry. Shit. - You need a hand with that? - No. You need to relax, young man. Oh! We're getting out of here. - Okay? I've just got to cut you free. - Mm-hmm. Are you sick? Mm-hmm. "That's a bad beat, huh? Fifty-two Pickup, huh?" That's funny. That's real funny, huh? I'll put a bullet in your fuckin' brain funny! How about that, huh? Oh, sorry, Jay. Sometimes people... You're lucky you're out here, Jay. That place is full of liars and cheats. I just came to warm it up for you. Where's he going? Sore Loser-ville. Good thing he doesn't gamble. Oh, it's gonna be a long night. Yeah. That's better, huh? Feeling better? You don't look so great. What the hell? Oh, shit. You do that? Don't touch the cardboard, okay? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. I know this is the scary part, but you're gonna be all right. You're gonna be more than all right. Just gotta hang in there, Jay. All right? It'll get much better when we get to Uncle Kenny's. Trust me. Shit! I was gonna bring you a snack. You like snacks? Brb. Shit. I can't be here when he comes back. There's not much time. Listen. Listen. Your name's Jay, right? Mm-hmm. My name's Darby, and I need to go get help. I'll come back. I promise I will. I promise. Party in the van? I left my phone out there. Uh-huh. I'll be back as soon as I can. "Party in the van." Are you serious? Shit. Hello? Darby? Everything okay in there? Look, if you need someone to talk to about your mom, I'm here. Get in here. Get in here. - What? Yeah, what's going on? - Just please... Okay. What the... What the hell is going on? He has a little girl tied up in his van. Mr. Bullshit? - Are you sure? - Yes. She's little, like, nine or ten. I knew he was a fucking creep. - We need to call the cops. - I tried. I tried. No service. Shit. No. What do we do? I don't know. I don't know. I hoped maybe you or Ed... Okay. Maybe we can wait until there's a break in the storm, - and then we can call cops. - No, it's gonna take too long. He's not gonna be able to go anywhere. There's a blizzard. He can't drive any... No, no, no. She's... She's sick or something. She could die out there. - We gotta go get her. - Yeah. But he's probably just waiting out there. I think he knows that I was in the van. That's why he came in here. If he suspects you, then he will follow you out, right? Mm-hmm. Okay, so if you go outside, he follows you out just long enough for me to tell Ed. And then the both of us will follow you straight out. He has a gun. Look. Maybe Ed has a gun. He's a marine. All right. You're gonna be okay. You're not gonna be out there by yourself. What if Ed doesn't have a gun? Then we have to find something here. Okay. So, where is Reno? Well, it's not on this map. Forty miles north of Lake Tahoe. I bet it'll still be there when the storm clears. I'm sorry we're stuck here. It's, uh... It's not your fault. I was the one that said we should stay. I know it hasn't been easy lately. Maybe the universe is telling us we need to spend more time together. I have to pull it off. Okay, like a Band-Aid. One, two... Fuck. It's okay. It's okay. We're getting you out of here right now, okay? But where are the men? Men? The ones who took me. How many men were there? How many men? Two. What's wrong? - She's in the van. - Yeah, no shit, she's in the van. - Why would you bring up Battle Mountain? - I'm not good at making things up. Then stay quiet. Listen, and that's it. Stay fucking quiet. Now we gotta do damage control. Give me the gun. - What's this? - Careful. I rigged the safety so it fires like a real gun. We were gonna ambush you. Let's go. What're we gonna do? Ash? Keys. Where the fuck is she? Did you see anything? No. - I'm going out there. - Ed. Ed. Just relax. Keep fucking quiet. Fuck. Go around. Whew! - Everything okay? - Yeah, it's, uh... It's all good. I don't like that guy. Ed, you don't know that guy. I've known plenty of "that guy." Weird little white boys with a chip on their shoulder. Give me your phone. You text anyone else about this? No. Let's see. Who sent these? Hmm? My sister. And she's expecting you at the hospital? Mm-hmm. And why would she write that? She doesn't want you there and, apparently, neither does your mom. Why do you care? I need to know who's messing up my life right now. Hey! Where's Darby? Darby? Yeah. Darby. I don't know. Ugh. Uh… I think she's outside trying to find bars. Darby's outside? Yeah. I'll be back in a minute. So your mom kicked you out of home, huh? Why'd she kick you out? Lots of reasons. Yeah? What did you do? Drugs. What kind of drugs? Whatever I could get. Bet your dad loved that, huh? Big-time war hero with a junkie daughter. He's dead. What, he die in the war? He shot himself in the head. Like this? No. Was it like this? - Um… - Well, then, it must've been like this. No? First, the kid got sick, then there's a storm, and now you. - A junkie. - You don't know me! I know exactly who you are. At least I'm not a child molester. I'm not a fucking child molester. This is about money. You should see the house that little girl lives in. Her dad's some tech big shot. So he's gonna pay and then we're gonna ship her back without a fucking scratch. She's sick. - She needs a doctor. - Yeah, no shit. She's got Addison's. If she gets too excited, she'll OD on adrenaline. So your little intervention didn't do her any favors. So, here's what's gonna happen. We're gonna walk out... Hi, uh, think I could talk to Darby for a moment, please? Sure. I'll see you outside. Fuck this up, I'll kill everyone. Uh, sorry to interrupt. We're just... We're stuck here. So… Mmm. You know, if there's anything else that you, um… I can handle it. Darby. - Lars was spying on us earlier. - Oh. So I wanted to talk to Ash alone without him following me. Mmm. Okay. 'Cause if there is something that's really wrong and you need to tell me anything, you will, right? Do you know anything about brain aneurysms? Uh, is that why your mom's in the hospital? Is she gonna die? If she's in the hospital, she's in the best place she can be, right? Darby, wanna join us? Please? You said your dad was Third Battalion, First Marines? - Mm-hmm. - Hmm. What'd he do? He was a gunner. How 'bout that. So was I. I bet we could swap some stories. What you said earlier about me not knowing what they go through, you were right. Darby, she told me what her dad did when he got home. It's a tragedy. I mean, someone taking their own life like that… I can't imagine that kind of pain. Sorry about your dad. That wasn't your goddamn story to share. You might wanna think harder before you open your damn mouth. Jesus. Well… I should go apologize. Yeah, you should. No! All you had to do was nothing. Ash? What are you doing? Where's the girl? She went up a hiking trail. Uncle Kenny's gonna be so pissed. Uncle Kenny's not gonna find out. We're gonna go get her right now. She's not gonna come to us. Doesn't matter how cold she is. Maybe not. But she'll come to her. - Get up. - Come on. - Quick, she's gonna freeze to death. - Get up. - Hurry! - Don't worry. - We're gonna find her, all right? - Okay. - She won't get far. - Yeah. I'm cold. It's really cold. Should've worn something warmer. We just gotta keep pushing, all right? We're almost out of here. When we get to Uncle Kenny's we're gonna look back at this and laugh. Yeah. We're not gonna tell him anything, though. Remember what happened last time? He went nuts. Yeah. He was so pissed. Who's Uncle Kenny? He's our foster dad. Took us in when no one else would. Better than blood. That's right. What's Uncle Kenny think about your line of work? We work for him. He finds them better homes. Call out for her. Do it. Jay? Jay. Louder. She dies out here, it's your fault. Jay! Louder. Louder, so she can hear it. Jay! - I told you she wasn't gonna go... - Jay! Ah, shit! - That was a gunshot. - Hmm. Are you sure? There's only one thing that sounds like a gunshot. Ed. - Is she alive? - Yes, she's alive. She's in a bad way. - Shot? Oh! - No. Be careful now. Lars! Hey. Oh, God. Ed, she's freezing. Give me your coat. Where the hell did she come from? Come on, honey. Shh. Come on. - What's this? - It's a medical alert bracelet. She's in an adrenal crisis. - You got her. - You know this girl? Ash and Lars kidnapped her. She was in their van. What? Ash has a gun. He's gonna kill us all if we don't get out of here. Jesus Chr... - She beat us back. - I can see that. We have to go now. Ed, she's right. We need to... We need to move. Come on, honey. - What do we do... - Lars! Give me a minute! - Yeah, yeah. All right. - All right? Hey! Give us the girl and no one gets hurt. They're gonna kill us. Don't make me come in there and get her. That's not gonna stop them. I'm buying us time. What are we doing here? - You ready? - Yeah. Okay. I got Ed, you cover the other two. - Okay. - Okay? Here they come. You walk through that door, I will shoot you dead. You think he's really got a gun? I don't know. Ed! I think I'm gonna call bullshit on that. Okay. Come on in. Fuck! Is it working? They're talking. Good. Let them talk all they want. Out there. We gotta get her out of there. - No shit, Lars. - She probably needs her medication. You're a goddamn genius, Lars. You're a goddamn genius! The girl is sick. She needs her meds, and we have them, Ed. Huh? We have them! Sandi, you're the nurse. You know it's true. You keep her, she dies. It's your choice. He's right. You give her to us, we'll be gone. It's that simple. I say we do it. - No! - No! If this girl does not get her medication, she will die. Let them take her. They can't leave. I have their keys. What? No. You have to give them back. We want them to leave. They have to leave. Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Hey, Ash? Yeah? Give us the medicine, and we'll let you leave. Are you serious? Yeah. Give us the medicine, and we'll give you the keys to your van. Ash? Ash! Medicine for the keys. Are they doing it? They're walking back to the van. Can you see anything? Do they have the medicine? No. They have a gas can. What? No, no. - Shit. - What the fuck do we do now? They're bluffing. They're not crazy enough to do it. - I think maybe they are. - Just give them what they want. If we do that, we're dead. You don't know that. Wait, wait, wait. They can't kill us if they can't leave, right? Hide the keys. These too. Go ahead. Ed! Hey, Ed! Ed. We should just give them what they want. We've been in holes before. And we're gonna claw ourselves out of this one the way we always do. But this isn't a hole. This is a grave. Splash it everywhere. Let's go. So what's your plan, Ash? What does it look like, Ed? Huh? It looks like you're thinking about setting fire to the only thing you care about and stranding yourself at the scene of the crime. You're stupid, Ash, but you're not that stupid. You know what's stupid, Ed? Stupid is getting yourself killed for a stranger. I'm a Marine, you idiot. It's what we do. How about you, Sandi? You wanna die because Ed wants to play hero? Huh? You give us the medicine. We give you the keys. You drive out and it's done. I'm done talking, Ed. They're hidden. Good. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I forgot I have something better. Since when you been carrying Mace? I'd need a much bigger purse to fit everything you don't know about me. Give me the matches. Are we really gonna burn 'em? That's up to them. Five! They won't do it. Four! Ed, please. Three! Fuck. Ed, I don't wanna die here. Nobody is dying here. Get in here. Ash? Come on. What are you doing? Two! Ed, please. He's crazy. He's gonna... He's gonna do it. We should give them what they want. They're bluffing. Mrs. Lowery? Hey, guys. This is my maid, Mrs. Lowery. And now she's gonna do the dance. Ready? No... Honey, I've got work to do. Well, then, I could tell my mom about that time I caught you smoking pot on the porch. Uh... Like this. ♪ Put your hands up ♪ Everybody go whoo! Put your hands up! Come on, dance with the vacuum. Do it! ♪ Put your hands up ♪ ♪ Everybody go whoo! ♪ That is so tragic! Oh, my gosh, you guys. That is so hilarious. This that video? Yeah. Jay does that kind of thing all the time. And you didn't hear anything? Well, I was vacuuming and I had my headphones on. No! Please! - Help, Mrs. Lower... - Stop! Come... - Calm down! It's gonna be okay. - Let me go! - Shut up! - Let me go! The medicine wasn't where you said it would be. And now she's dying again. So you need to come meet us, or we'll bury this kid in the mountains and you get nothing. You got that? One! Wait! Wait! He doesn't have a gun! - What the fuck did you just do? - God! She's the one who fucking did... Jesus Christ, Sandi! Are you crazy? Ash, what... What'd she say? The bank called me, and they told me that it was all gone. Our savings, our future. All of it, Ed. All of it! So I tried to fix it. That is what I did. Why didn't you just say something? I had a plan! What? You're gonna win it back? We're coming in, Ed. Drop it! Drop it! - Lars, take her over by Jay. - What? Do it. Stay there! Please, don't move. Please. - Leave... - You're gonna... You're gonna be okay. I just wanna go home. Yeah, I do too. Are you done? Hurry up, Sandi! You'll be okay now, Jay. Kid's gonna live. Hallelujah! How did you even meet these freaks? The Internet. We were never even supposed to meet and nothing was supposed to happen to Jay and nothing is going to happen to her, right? You're still gonna ransom her, right? They were never gonna ransom her. They traffic kids. They sell them. You got catfished. Don't you say that. Yeah. We're finding her a better home. Right, Ash? - That's right, Lars. - Yeah! No. Whatever you were planning, you can still change your minds. It's $2 million. Is someone offering you more than that? Huh? Whatever it is, Jay's parents will triple it. - They'll... They'll triple... - No. Ed, you get it, right? I just did it for the money. It's so much money... Sandi, this isn't about the fucking money. Shut up. We don't deliver the kid, we're fucked. Okay. Okay. Okay, you've got her now, so why don't you just leave? Well, that's a good idea, Sandi. Where are the keys, Ed? I don't know. I'm done playing games! Where did you put the keys? Fuck you. She hid them out back somewhere. Darby! Where did you put the keys? Listen, you tell him, and we're all dead. No! Oh, God. No! Oh, Ed. I'm so sorry. No, no! No, no! No! No! No! No! No, please! No! Please! No, please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Listen, please, please! Ash. Ash, my eyes! Hey. Let me see. We're gonna wash it out. Okay? Come on. Jay, if you move, I'll kill her. You killed him. You shot him dead. You shot him. Ja... Jay! I need your hel... I need your help. It's okay. Quickly. Come... Come here. Come here. I had to. I had no choice. I have to look after us. All right? - I know. I know! - I have to look after... I have to look after you, Lars! - I'm scared. - I need the hammer. I need the hammer. I need you to keep it together. We just gotta get the keys, and we're gone. All right? Come on. Let's go. - No. - Shh! Okay, okay. It's quitting time, Darby. Where are the keys? I don't have them. Your mom died. Thoughts and prayers. What's wrong? The text to the cops went through. You know she sent a text? Yeah, but I deleted it. Where are the keys? Keys. Where are the keys, Darby? No! Please! No! Ash, don't! - Please, no. No, please! - In the snow. - In the... - Please! In the snow outside the bathroom! No. Lars. All right. Hold it. Come on. You got that? If she tries anything, you shoot her, okay? All roads are opening back up… It's okay, Jay. We're gonna be out of here soon. Come on. I need you to turn out the lights. I can't. Yes, you can. He won't hurt you. Jay, what are you doing? - Lars. I know you don't wanna hurt Jay. - Jay, sit down. Go back now. Jay, sit down! - Lars. Listen to me. - Uh-huh? You're not that guy, Lars. You don't have to do this. - Jay, don't... - Lars, that's not who you are. - You're not like him. - Shut up! Shut up! - Put the gun down, Lars. - Stop. - Lars, she's just a little girl! - Tell her to sit down! Tell her. - It's okay, Jay. It's okay. - I need you to sit down, okay? I have a gun. Jay. Jay, where are you going? Jay. Please. He told you what was gonna happen. Don't make me use this. Huh? Jay? I need you to sit down now. Jay. Before he comes back, I need you to sit down. Wait... No... Don't... Turn the light back on. No! No! Darby! Hang on! No! - No! - Come on! - No! - Jay, stand up! - Get off the ground! - No! Jay! Get up! Yes, yes. No! Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Shit! Ash. Ash.
