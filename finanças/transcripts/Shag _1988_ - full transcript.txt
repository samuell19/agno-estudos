Ah! Luanne, this place is huge. Oh, wow. Wow. I think I could live here. Luanne, this is some beach house. There are going to be some rules around here. For one thing, I don't want anybody sitting on the furniture. If you have to sit down, then just sit on the floor. Also... don't anybody use the telephone. Oh, come on, Luanne. The house is supposed to be empty. If we run up that phone bill And daddy sees someone was here- What about calling Harley? You're not calling Harley! And furthermore... daddy's bourbon... strictly off limits. Other than that... why, make yourselves at home! "5:30- Give your hair "A fresh set. "He's worth the extra trouble. " How does she know? "After your bath, apply a cloud-Like spray "Of his favorite cologne, "And don't forget your deodorant. " I can't believe she put that in here. "6:30- Apply makeup. " What does she say about eyeliner? Does she do that little taily thing at the end? I think eyeliner looks trashy. I wear eyeliner. Well, I like the way it looks on some people. So, what does that add up to? She spends 21/2 hours getting ready to go out? Reckon that's how she got to be miss Galaxy. She's not even that pretty. Don't y'all think she looks Exactly like Mary Pat Montgomery? Ewwwwww! Ha ha ha! Mary Pat Montgomery was the one Who told me about boners. Gross! It isn't a bone at all. It's a muscle. This cousin of hers dated a clemson tiger Who sprained his in a game. And she had to massage it every night when it got hard Because he was in so much pain. Mary Pat told you that? And she always acts so innocent! Ok, come on. What do y'all think? French twist or bubble flip? Bubble flip's much better for shagging. Come on, let's go. I'm not gonna dance. It wouldn't be right. You're gonna dance. Honey, this is your weekend. Just forget about that ol' wedding. And let us spoil you. Carson, I will never get over How tiny your feet are. What size do you wear? Four? 41/2? Harley is certainly a very lucky boy. Sugar... what's wrong? Looky, looky. It's Binky. Sugar, tell Luanne what's wrong. I love y'all so much. And, uh... y'all are going off to college and everything. And you're gonna forget me.

Wow! Yeah! Look, there's Johnny! Johnny! Where you going, blondie? Luanne, how come you never brought us here before? I haven't brought you here now. Right, girls? Oh, right.

Luanne, damn it, you made me lose miss Sun Queen, But I'm not going to lose Jimmy Valentine, too. Now, you owe it to me. And you better get over there quick Or we're never gonna speak to you again. Right, Pudge? Right. Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy! Excuse me. Do you mind? I am a nurse, and this is an emergency. Excuse me. Hi! I'm thrilled to meet you. I'm Luanne Clatterbuck. My daddy, senator Buford S. Clatterbuck Asked me to cordially invite you Over to the house for a cocktail with the family. Right now. Uh... I can't. I'm supposed to do this promotional thing. Oh, well, it's gonna be a great party. Everyone's gonna be shagging. Yeah, beach music. My manager's like a priest, man. You think I get to go to parties? Aah! Will there be, like, girls there? Girls? This is the grand strand. Myrtle Beach. Wild! Wild. It's not a party- There'll be a band and everything. Are you sure you can't come? Carson, y'all aren't eloping? I'm going back to Spartanburg tonight with Harley. Harley's so square, he's got corners. What's wrong with Buzz? He's a sweet potato. They're here! Carson, tell me quick- some Jimmy Valentine things. You know, favorite color, favorite perfume. Jimmy Valentine's not down there. Honey, Luanne got him. Red? Blue? Jimmy Valentine in this house? So is Harley. Blue. It's definitely blue. Pudge, run downstairs and get Jimmy Valentine a drink. Buzz... I can't bring myself To hurt a decent, God-fearing boy Like Harley Ralston. Would you object if I check on my little Carson? She's asleep, Harley. She had a real bad headache. Where we going? Which room, Luanne? I don't know. Call her, Harley. Sugar pie. Ha ha ha. The senator regrets that he has been detained By a very, very important phone call from Washington. I think it's Jacqueline Bouvier herself. Lemonade? Uh... nah. Scotch and water would be fine. Man... look at that fish. Look at the expression in his... eye. He knows it's over. Man, I dig parties the most. Ow! When's the band get here? There's no answer at Carson's house. Well, then, I'm calling the police. No, Harley, there's absolutely no need to call the police- You know what? She took the bus back to Spartanburg. She wouldn't be there yet. She missed you so bad, She jumped right on that bus and went home. She went back to Spartanburg on a bus? In the middle of the night, unescorted? She's left all her clothes up there.

Only, you know what I just realized? I don't have to fall in love with anybody. I can just write to you. It's not like writing to a girl or nothing.

Harley, I think somebody's been here. Oh! Oh! I see! Oh! Elvira, what are you doing here? I come to open the house up for the senator, On account of him and your mama Are arriving on the noon plane. Did you see all the mess? Alex, where's my shoe? Y'all get out! Get up and get out! Move on out of here! See you later. Oooh. I thought it might interest you to know That my parents might be arriving any minute. Now here. You wear these. Come on, now. Go, go, go! Are you... are you... fuzzy? You shut your filthy mouth. All right. Where is he? Oh, God. What are you doing? Easy. I think I'm blind. Wait! Jimmy, Jimmy, write down my phone number. Come on. Come on. Come on, huh? Huh? You see that? Do you see this? I got 10 grand in that mouth. It's gorgeous. You should have teeth like this. You ever see a chin like that? It's like art, like sculpture. 3 grand. Singing lessons. The kid has got a wardrobe Makes Liz Taylor look like a cleaning lady. I'm talking about investment, all right? So don't think I'm gonna let Some piece of dixie ass parade in here and crap all over my dream. Let's go. Come on. I know! Let's you and me pick them up at the airport. You and me are in Fort Sumter. Whose is this? Carson. Oh, my God. Carson. What am I gonna tell Harley? Tell him you're in love with me. He'd never believe that. Oh, God. I wish Harley would die. It would be so much easier. I didn't mean that. It's terrible. Tell him you're going to college. With you? Crazy, girls don't go to Yale. But there's loads of women's colleges around there. That's how Yale gets around not letting any females in. All the girls from these other schools come over on weekends. I mean, they don't expect Yale men To go 4 years without sex. You want me to go all the way up there To a yankee school Just so I can come over every weekend And practice free love with you. Well, not every weekend. Aah! I can't find 'em anywhere. Chip, where do you think Buzz would go? We better start calling motels. Motels? Oh, my God! If daddy's little girl is your daddy's yacht, Luanne, I hope you know there's somebody down there on it. They're not in the attic. Thank you for reporting That there's somebody on the yacht, Harley. Chip, come take Harley up to the senator's study And show him daddy's collection Of confederate uniform buttons. Buttons? Maybe I better call Carson. There's one that's got some blood on it. Go take a peek. What buttons? What happened? Nothing. We had a party. What happened to you? Did you go all the way? Oh, my God. Oh! Are you sure? You poor thing. Here, put your feet up, OK? What did it feel like? Don't ask her that! Wait, wait. Did it hurt? Melaina! You must really love him. I hate him to death. He attacked her. I knew it! No. He didn't attack me. I let him. Y'all... I'm wild. Guess I've been wild all along. I just didn't know it till now. Way out! Y'all think I should throw Harley over? Yes! It's only fair. It's liable to kill him. He'll get over it, I know. Pudge, go get Harley, OK? He's upstairs. Wait! Don't y'all think I better marry somebody? I mean, I am way out of control. So marry Buzz. I wouldn't marry Buzz Ravenel If he were the last man in the free world. Beevo? You rape artist. I only want to talk to her. Jeez. Hello, Harley. Hi. Hi, Harley. Who are you? Buzz Ravenel. It's nice to meet you. Maid, huh? Buzz is, uh- He's- He's Luanne's boyfriend. He is not! Oh, Luanne. Don't deny our love. If Luanne asks where I went, tell her I'm on a manhunt. What are you doing in mrs. Clatterbuck's closet? Looking for my ticket to Hollywood. Why the face? Melaina, what am I gonna do? I love him so much I feel sick. He acts like I'm his pen pal. You spent the last 24 hours with him. What more do you want? I want him to feel like I feel. Does this look like a birthmark? Remember in forever amber When they were on the balcony? I want him to take me in his arms and crush me with passion. There's only one way to catch a boy like Chip. Make yourself look irresistible, and act like you can't stand him. And be nice. And above all, do not bring them to this house until we've left for Spartanburg. Well, what about the shag contest? That's it. That's a good idea. You take them to the shag contest. No, I ain't taking them to the shag contest. I was supposed to be in the shag contest with Pudge. Don't be stupid. You can't take Pudge to the shag contest. I'm taking her back to Spartanburg with me. Well, what if they don't want to go to the shag contest? I don't care. You take them there anyway. Nobody wants to get married, OK? Go, go, go! I don't especially feel like getting married myself. That's no reason to call off a wedding. My daddy's invited half the state. Don't test me, Carson. Pudge? Caroline? Don't be a moron. He's only knocked once. Perfume should linger. Caroline? Pudge? Be cruel. What do you want? Um, gosh... blue. Um. I guess you're leaving and everything. I just wanted to say that I'm sorry We didn't get to enter the shag contest together, and- Well, I was thinking maybe I'd come down from Annapolis- I wouldn't shag with you If you were the last man in the free world. Now, wait about 5 minutes, And go offer him a chance to apologize. Chip? Oh, Chip? Where is he? I sent him to pick up my folks. Is he coming back here? Of course not. He's gone, Pudge. Now, hurry. And go change your clothes. We're leaving now. Buford, what are we doing in this contraption? Sir, let me ask you something. In my experience with girls, I've found that as soon as a girl knows you're in love with her, she starts treating you just like a dirtball. You found that to be true, sir? Every time, son. Every time. I tried to be so cool this time. Just like Buzz. I never let on I was crazy about her, like I definitely was not in love with her. But she knew. She looked right into my mind and she knew. This boy is crazy. Son, did your supervisor tell you where to take us? Because we're running real, real late here. ...directly to the pavilion. Uh... But there's a shag contest at the pavilion, sir. Yeah. We're guests of the Mayor. We're the judges. We'd have been in that shag contest If she didn't... if she hadn't... if she didn't... did you attempt a familiarity with this young lady? No, sir! I'm a southern gentleman, sir. Recently accepted at the United States naval academy at Annapolis. Annapolis? Well, I'm an Annapolis man myself, son. Really, sir? Say, you know, I got a tie exactly like that. This is intimate. Let me out. What are you doing with that guy? I'm insulted. He's completely wrong for you. You don't know me. You don't love me. You sure as all damn don't want to marry me. So why don't you leave me the hell alone? I don't think I can. Hah! That's my mama's dress. Take that off right now! Melaina Buller, you take every stitch of this Off your body! You see if I ever invite you to Hollywood. Everything's in the car, Luanne. I left your keys in the ignition. Thank you, Harley. I wish everyone was as considerate as you. I thought it would be so sweet- One last fling together... best friends... those selfish little twerps. I wish Carson was half as mature As you, Luanne. You're a great person. I keep telling myself It'll be different after we get married, but what if it isn't? Follow your heart. Y'all is the horniest bunch of white folks I ever seen. Luanne, I'll be right back. Don't be mad. No! Oh, no! Oh! You Judas! Don't worry, Luanne. My T-Bird can catch a Cadillac any day. Son of a bitch! Are you coming in? No. There's no point now. I got to get back. Luanne will be mad. Well, thanks for the lift. I'll write you from California. Good luck with Jimmy Valentine. Jimmy Valentine? Pudge, he's small potatoes. I love you, Melaina. Me, too.
