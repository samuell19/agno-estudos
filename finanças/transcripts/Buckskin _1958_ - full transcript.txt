Pa, isn't thereany way we can stay? You know there isn't. If we allgot together, we could open upthe creek and run marlowe'sbunch out. There's been too much killing. There are plenty of valleys, and we'll find one. Your mother's crying again. Get in the house and give her some comfort. [Horse whinnies] Jimmy, get the rifles! Some Indians are coming! How many are there, pa? Two of them. Two too many. Get in the barn and cover me. Is there goingto be trouble, frank? Stay in the house, Sarah. I think if we show them we mean business, they may leave US alone. They're not Indians. At least,the man isn't. Something you want? Yeah, I've been looking for water. Thoughti might try here. Water? We ain't got water. Why do you think we're moving out? Sorry to bother you. No, wait a minute. We won't be using the water in the trough. There's no need letting it go to waste. All right, go ahead. I thank youfor the water, but I'd feela lot better if whoever'scovering mewould come out. I almost shot him. It's all right, Jimmy. A stream ranthrough this partof the country. There was, until rep marlowe bought the land north of here and dammed it up. Marlowe?he's a gambler,not a land baron. You know a lot about what's going on. Who are you, mister? Boy, you're liableto get a man angry, pointingthat at him. Mr. Marlowe makes his money off the cowboy and the miners. He thinks we homesteaders will bring law and order. How many peopledepend on the waterhe's blocked up? Seven. We're joining them in a little while. We're moving to Oregon. Mm-hmm. Boy, unhitch that horse, ride and tell the others that they'll have water. Why should you carewhat happens to US? I still want to knowwho you are. My name is chaddock. Montana territorial marshal. Frank, does that mean we can stay? But marlowe owns the land the dam's on, legal and proper. You'd be breaking the law. A badge in my pocket says I'm the law. My name is frank Cody. This is my wife Sarah and my son Jimmy. Boy, when you talk to the others, tell them I'll want them to file homesteading claims. Yes, sir. There won't be any trouble, will there? When the railroadcomes through herenext year, this place will befilled with homesteaders. Better to register now,avoid trouble later. Of course, marshal. Boy, weren't yougoing somewhere? Uh...yes, sir. I knew the government wouldn't let US down. We've worked so hard on this land. My son's motherwas Indian. Her people were surethe governmentwouldn't let them down. But them Indians never did anything with this land. They're nothing but a bunch... This is your land now. I'll protect it for you. Much obligedfor the water. You'd thinkthey could at least send a man whowas full civilized. Rep marlowe will civilize him. Jimmy, ride over and tell the others what the marshal said. We'll hang around for a while and see what happens. Oh, uh,howdy, sheriff. Passenger list in yet? Oh, yeah. Yeah,here you are. Don't look likeno lawman on it. Who's this Talbot? Oh, he's thatfarm equipmentdrummer came through here,oh, last spring. Oh, yeah. Well, this time he ain't going to have nobody to sell anything to, is he? I'll see you later. Morning, tangley. Where's marlowe, still in bed? Was playing cardswhen I come in. Travis here losteverything he had... More than 3,000. Stupid half-wit. Hello, sheriff. Did you hear? I lost all my money. I was going home to St. Louis. You never donenothing to earnthat money anyhow. Didn't I? We was out here before anybody. We cleared this land, my brothers and me. Indians killed my brothers, scalped 'em. But I killed six of them for every one of my brothers. The sheriff didn't mean nothing. You'll make it again, Travis. You always do. Come on now and sit down. Mr. Marlowe don't want any trouble. I'm to keep him here till this afternoon, and you're to see that he's on that stage. Oh, sure. Treat him real good... The stupid crud! Hey, Travis, come here. Come here. Do you see what I see? That's the injun that killed your brothers. No. What do you mean, no? I seen their scalps hanging from his belt. They killed your brothers, Travis. And they're laughing at you! Listen. They're laughing at you, Travis, 'cause they killed your brothers. They're laughing. They're laughing, Travis! What did youtell him that for? That crud's going to get what he's got coming. What's this fight about? Listen, you think you can come into this town and run roughshod over people, you got another think coming. My name is chaddock.I'm the newterritorial marshal. How'd I know? You wasn't wearing no badge. Take him to jail,get him a doctor. He don't need one. I got business to attend to. You can take him to jail your... Do as I sayor take off that badge. All right, marshal. I didn't mean no offense. Come on, Travis. Come on. Sheriff, after you get him a doctor, wait for me. I want to see you. You all right? Yeah, son, I'm all right. Hi. Something I can do for you, marshal? Yeah, my sonneeds a haircut, a bath, and, uh,some clothes. Just what sort of clothes do you have in mind? Oh, well, uh... Well, what...Whatevera boy his size wouldbe wearing this year. Sung li, get the bath started. O.k., sir. Pa, I wantto go home. Now, son, I told you it wouldn't be easy. I don't like this place. I don't likethese people. I want to go back. Akii, there's nothing to go back to. Besides, I promised your mother I'd bring you up in a...Civilized man's world. No. I'm an Indian.I want to go back. Back to what, the reservation? Where your mother died? Where the people are starving and they won't even allow them to hunt? No, akii. No. The Indian way is dying. It's not happening to you. You're my son. But whatif they kill you? They wouldn't kill a marshal. [Door opens] Bath ready. Indian boy take bath with clothes on? You take a bath now. Let them cut your hair. I'll pick you up later. Got some more in back. Most of the families with kids moved out a while ago. Well, I'm surethese will be fine. That mean you're staying in gloryhole, marshal? Mm-hmm. Why the sudden interest in our welfare? Hmm? Officials up in Helena never bothered with US before. Maybe they figuredthat some ofthe people here deserve each other. You think we like living under rep marlowe's law? There's one wayto find out. Could youcall a meetingof the townspeople in front ofthe sheriff's office, say? Marlowe doesn't like US to have meetings. That's one reasonI'm calling this one. All right. I'll do it. Morning, Mr. Marlowe. Tangley... Any sign of that marshal? He ain't come out of the general store yet. Breakfast will beready in a minute,mr. Marlowe. Hey, patch, I understand you acted kind of jumpy when you heard the marshal's name was chaddock. We've met. What does that mean? I'm going to kill him. You'll kill him when I tell you. I'll kill himthis morning. Tomorrow this valley will be ours and with it, control of all the land east of the bitter roots. You'll kill him then. I'll bet he had something to do with your face. He did, didn't he? For five yearsI've waitedto catch up with him. I'll wait till tomorrow. - Tangley! - Huh? Has chaddock gone tothe telegraph office yet? No. That means no onein Helena knowshe reached here. Who in townwould say different? Mr. Marlowe, if he'd a-got off that stage, we'd have bushwhacked him. Patch... I shouldn't play poker all night anymore. I don't think so clear the next morning. Are we going to kill him? First we're going to stack the cards, be sure that nobody sends a telegraph to Helena. Why don't you ride out of town a ways and sort of cut the wires? Look...there he comes out of the store now. See? There he is. Before you go on your little chore, find out what he's doing in the store. I'll be over at the hotel. There goes a dead man. You don't need a doctor, Travis. You just need time to sober up. Chaddock! How are you, doc? They told me in helenaI'd find you here. That's why iasked the sheriffto get you. I thought you could fill me in. Tangleydidn't get me. I happened bywhen he draggedpoor Travis in. Don't tell me you'rethe new marshal? Yeah, that's me, doc. How'd they get youto take this job? I thought it might be a good place to raise my son. My wife and the littlest... They died. Smallpox. I'm sorry. Yeah. Yeah, so am I. What's his story, doc? Why'd he jump me? I understand it was sheriff tangley's idea, you know. Travis there, he's not quite right. He lost all his money to marlowe, and he's halfway out of his mind. For a little sport, tangley got Travis all mixed up and told him you and your son were the Indians that killed his brothers. That sheriff's mindis just as clutteredas this office. Who you looking for anyway? Oddly enough,our friend the sheriff. There he is now. It's time somebodytaught him some manners. Wait for me,will you, doc? I thought I told you to wait in your office. Why, you... You try that again, you'd never get up. Kill him! Kill him right now! You'll never make it, patch. Sounds like he remembers you. Why don't you draw? He'd kill US both. Well, looks like the new marshal has won the first hand. Oh, doc, take a look at red, will you, please? Sung li, come over here. What did he want in your store? Wire cutters, and, uh... And he... "And he"? He said they're going to kill you. And he also say they kill anybody who say you've been here. Cut the telegraph wire,kill me, pretendi never arrived. That the idea, tangley? I don't need to tell you nothing. You tell me wherethe telegraph officeis right now. Marshal... Hmm? He not pay for wire cutters. Give the man back his wire cutters. Let's go. Send a wire... Montana territorial marshal's office, Helena. Is, uh...Is that all right, sheriff? He's not the sheriff anymore. Start sending. Yes, sir. The bartender's one less gun to worry about. Dead? Yeah. I'll start a pot of coffee in your office. Thanks, doc. I'll be right over. We're readyfor the message. Arrived gloryhole safe and sound. Sign it chaddock. Yes, sir, marshal. I got a message for you, too, tangley. Tell marlowe next time I don't wait for anybody to draw. Make it clear. Yes, sir. Bring that to the marshal's office. Marshal. Yeah? You asked for a meeting. I wanted to meetall the townspeople. That's all that would come. Hmm. No wonder marloweruns this town. Remember, we have to be firm. Gentlemen. Marshal. Thank youfor meeting with me. You can pass alongto the otherswhat I say. Soon the railroadwill be comingthrough here. Marshal, I think we know what you're going to say. The fact is, we want you to get out of gloryhole. What are you saying? This man was sent to give US law and order so we have a chance to live in dignity. What happens when he's killed? We'll still have to live with rep marlowe. I called this meetingto ask for your help, not your permission. I was sentto clean up this town. If you don'twant to help, just don'tget in my way. Nice town you got here, doc. Ah, those peopleare frightened, chaddock. You can't blame them. Marlowe's becomea desperate manthe last few months. I came here expecting gloryhole to be wide open. Instead I find an almost ghost town with a handful of terrified people. Well, gold'splaying out fast. Pretty soonit'll be a ghost town. But if the people really believe that, why do they stay? Why does marlowe stay here? Well, marlowe,i don't know. The others hopethat things willget better again. Maybe when the railroad comes. Not a boom town, but they'll be able to make a living. I wish I could figure out what marlowe's trying to do. Doc, do you knowwhy he cut off the squatter'swater supply? Marshal? Mr. Marlowe offered me $500 last week to file on one of those farms when it was abandoned. Oh? And then what, sell it back to him? Yes, sir, but I turned him down. Didn't need the money then. Just waiting to take the stage home. Hey, doc... Doc, I think I know why marlowe tried to get me killed. Look at this, doc. If marlowe could get this valley, when the railroad comes through, he'd control all of eastern Montana. Is that possible? Yes, it is possible, unless I can figure out some way to stop him. You mean open upthe dam again? At least that would keep the homesteaders here. As soon as they gettheir water back, won't that bethe end of it? Not until they file for homestead. Marlowe could chase them off and file for himself. I got to figure out some way to do away with that dam. Have you seen it, doc? No, I haven't, but it's too riskyto try alone. I've seen it, marshal. Ain't nothing some dynamite won't bust, if you ever get close enough. Thanks, Travis. You going out there now? No, doc. Not yet. I want to talkwith my son first. You thought you came to tame a town, but it'll be a lot more trouble than that. Be careful, chaddock. Marlowe is dangerous. Yeah. That's far enough. We weren't jawing justto hear ourselves talk. You're leaving town,marshal. Corbin, don't be a fool. Keep out of this, doc. You better listen to me. We'll handle this. Go get his kid. I wouldn't do that if I were you. One more stepand I'll shoot. Why don't you put that gun away? I told you to stay out of my way. The next thing I break won't be a gun. You're a lucky man, Corbin. I tried to warn you. If we don't get thatmarshal out of town, we'll all be killed. We've all been dead for years. This whole town has been. Thing is,now we get buried. He's the only chance for life we've got! Well, now. Well, now,I'd say we wereall slickered up. Sung li showed me where they heat the water for the baths. That was very niceof you, sung li. Pa, what happened in the street? Well, akii,I'll tell youall about that later. Right now,you've got to getyour haircut. Sung li says if anyone needs a bath and haircut, that's you. He's right. I've gotsome business first, then I'll behis next customer. - Really? - Mm-hmm. We give boy haircut now. Come on. There something I can do for you, marshal? How do you tella little boy that the whole townwants to killhis father? Not the whole town. Oh. I know.I'm sorry. Mr. Perkins, I want threesticks of dynamitegift-wrapped. You going to use them on marlowe? That depends on him. You all right? My son's laughter. For a second there,i was remindedof his mother on a long ago July. What are youdoing here? I had to see you. Where are the others? They're still out guarding the dam. We didn't see none of the sodbusters moving out. We decided to find out why. We thought I better tell you. And? There's a new marshal... Sent word he's gonna open up the dam. Chaddock does know. I don't think so. If the people in Helena knew what you were up to, they'd send more than one man. Chaddock's alone. You may be right,but either way,i don't like it. Browdie,this new marshal'sa big man, and he wears buckskins, but he doesn't wearany badge. So if you see himanywhere near that dam, you and the boys shoot,and you shoot to kill. I'll ask you again. Why wait? Do you knowwhat trouble killing a marshalhere in towncould bring? I know what he can bring if we don't. I'll make hima fair offer. He can't be bought. Anybodycan be bought. Mr. Marlowe's right. Any white man marries an injun squaw, why, he ain't so high and mighty. How do you know? He had that kid with him, his son... A half-breed. A boy? You didn't say anything about a boy. Yeah, a kid about 10 years old. He's right. You should havetold US. But, no matter. We'll take careof the kid after the father'sout of the way. If he knows of your plan to take over the valley, it's all over! I don't knowwhat's gotten into you. We'll use himto gather in all thosehomestead claims. Then if he doesn'ttake my offer, him and his kidare the losers. I've been waitingall my lifefor this chance. It's one potI'm going to win. Want this? Nah. Pa...pa! Now, I didn't mean tofrighten him, marshal. You make a habit of breaking jail? Mr. Marlowesent me to get you. He's stillat the sheriff's office. Says he wants to talk. How many guns with him? I think he's all alone,marshal. You get sung li to take you over to doc Raymond's. Introduce yourself. I'll be along in a little while. No buts. Go on. [Yelling and cheering] What's that carnival all about? Miners coming infor Saturday night. That's justthe first of 'em. Town'll be filledbefore nightfall. They always that noisy? They're behavin'themselves now, marshal. After the Wells fargoman gets here and exchangestheir gold forspending money, all hell breaks loose. Not anymore, it doesn't. Now, marshal... I'm really sorryabout what happenedbefore. Guess I hadtoo much to drink. If there's anythingi can do... Our horses could stand a feeding. I'll be glad to. Oh, marshal, like the doc says,be careful ofmr. Marlowe. He's tricky. Thanks. Not a very nice place to meet. Sheriff tangley keeps a real pigsty. That's notvery surprising,is it, Mr. Marlowe, consideringthe former sheriff'sfriends? I have no friends, marshal. Tangley works for me. Everyone in this town, one way or another, works for me. And now you want tohire me. What's your price? More than you've got,marlowe. More than I've got. This is my town.I own it. I own thisvery buildingwe're standing in. Oh. Worth about $300, wouldn't you say? If you're in town next week, drop by for a voucher. The territory of Montana owns it now. You can't do that! No? I just did. There's another piece of your property I'm going to dispose of... Unless you want to save me the trouble by opening that dam yourself. Marshal, there's...1,000, 2,000... In gold. It's yours. Marlowe...marlowe, those homesteaders aren't going to move out. Tomorrow morning I'm going to deliver their signed claims to the stagecoach driver. He'll take them to the registrar's office in Helena for filing. I'll add 5,000 to that. That'll fix yourfamily up real nice. Just ride out of townand don't come back. What's left of my family is with me right now. All the more reason,then. Marshal, don't makethat boy of yoursan orphan. Don't you ever threaten my boy again, marlowe. Go on. Get out of here! Something bothering you, boy? That man... He keptlooking at me. Hello, doc. Hi, chaddock. You and the docbeen gettingto know each other? Yeah, pa. Whatcha beentalking about? We were just talking. Son, run off to the general store and tell Mr. Perkins I said to give you some candy. No, thank you. What's the matter,you sick? Look at those miners. They work hard all week, then on Saturday night they give marlowe everything they've grubbed up. Why are they in the street?Isn't the saloon open? Marlowe doesn't start the girls and the gambling till after dark. I wish I... Look here, chaddock, I've got to talk to you alone. The boy can hearanything you wantto say to me. All right. Get out now before it's too late. Why doesn't marlowe? Sure as i'm standing here, you'll get yourself killed. The boy deserves better than that. Yeah. Yeah, you're right,doc. He does. People deservea lot of things. They don't get themby running away. You take him to another town, another territory. Marry again and give him a mother. What's more important than that? To know that his fatherwon't back down. Chulee! Help! Well, looky here.We got ourselvesa pigtail. Oh, no! No, please! No! No, please! Please! Oh...oh, no! Please! [Gunshot] [Chaddock]Let him go. We was just after his pigtail. And a small thinglike a man's dignity wouldn't standin your way,would it? This ain't none of your concern. I won't forget this. You better not. You all right? Yes, sir. Your son... He very smart boy. He say you good man. You very brave. Thank you. Thank you. I go now? Mm-hmm. Oh, sung li,i want to ask youa question. Is therea schoolteacherin this town? Uh...miss Johnson. She used to teach school. Now she work for Mr. Marlowe. Works for marlowe?How'd that happen? Long time ago, uh, miners come into town. They break into her house. After that, people say she can no longer teach children. Where does she live? I think she live in hotel now. Thanks, sung li. I'll go clean up,then go see her. Let's go inside. I'm tired. Tired. Well, you didn't get much sleep last night. That chaddock...If he thinks he'sgoing to stop me now, he's not. The stakesare too high. He'll try. I've told you that. But why? What's this townto him? I offered him money...$2,000. Thinks i'llthrow in my hand. What does he knowabout being old and backed intoa corner? At my age,I'll never getanother chance like this. This whole territorycan be mine. If he tries tostop me now, so help me god,I'll grind himinto dust! That pleasure's going to be mine. Tangley! Tell the miners what I said. Yes, sir! Howdy, boys.Boys, boys! Boys, I gotgood news for you. You don't have to waitfor the Wells Fargo mantoday. Mr. Marlowe saysthe drinks is on the house. As far as gambling'sconcerned, why, he says he'll acceptyour personal ious. Oh. When did marlowe get so all-fired generous? He just wantsyou to know that he knowswho his real friends are. Now you go in thereand have a time. I'm going to getthe women now. Yeah. That can build a lot of friendship. Who is it? My name is chaddock.I'm the new marshal. Where'd marlowe find you? He didn't. The territoryof Montana did. Is this an official visit? If you like. I don't go to work until nightfall. Uh, wait, wait a minute, miss Johnson. Miss Johnson, I understand you're a schoolteacher. Ha! That wassomebody else from the countyof once-upon-a-time. Well, I have a little boy. Well, that's notmy problem. No. No, it's mine, but it... Could be yours. Not anymore.Never again. Why not? Why don't youget out of here? Miss Johnson, I don't think you understand. This place is changing. Changing around here? The railroad is coming through next year. Homesteaders will flood in. Homesteaders have kids. Kids need schooling. They won't want me. I think maybe they will. Look, you don'tknow me. You don't knowthis town... The gossip,the filth. I'm everythingthey say I am. And you're everything you used to be. You been hurt, but you don't have to quit. And underneath all this make-up, I see a schoolteacher. [Knock knock] All right, girls, Mr. Marlowe wants you at the saloon right away. Nora. Nora. Nora. Why don't you answer your door? [Knocking] Nora! What's this all about? Oh...i...i...i ain'tsupposed to tell. But maybei could tell you, if we could do itkind of private-like. Marlowe wouldn't like that. Well, then...I ain't gonnatell you. We could have a drink together later. Well...now,don't you tell any ofthose girls over there. Mr. Marlowe, he wants the minersin a good mood today because there'sa new marshal in town, and he's causingtrouble, and Mr. Marlowewants to get rid of him. There, now, I...I...I told you. How about you... No! All right,miss schoolteacher. You ain't no betterthan the rest of them. You better bedown there in 15 minutes with the rest of 'em, or i-I'll...Aw! You forgot to tell me you're a dead man. You quit easy. When I wasa little girl, a man came to townselling watches in solid gold cases. Three days later,when the casesturned green, I couldn't find him. Now you come herewith all yourfancy talk... Only this timeI'm not buying, because whatyou're selling is just as phonyas those cases were. What I'm selling is as good as the person who buys it. Get out of here,dead man. I get paidfor talking...10 cents a drink. Yeah, maybe you're right. Maybe I am a dead man. Maybe that's why I came here. [Coins jingle] There's enough for a hundred drinks. If I don't come back, talk to my boy. What do I sayto him? Oh... Just let him hold onto you for a little while, then send him on his way. Well, son, I see that you and Mr. Travis are becoming friends. Mr. Travis has a boy, same as me. My wife sent itto me last month. Just a likenesson a piece of tin. Haven't seen himin four years. Too busy tryingto catch a rainbow. Handsome family. I got the horsesfed, marshal. I left akii'sat the stable. Thank you. Wait here, will you? Come inside, son. I want to have a talk with you. Pa, I saw that man with a patch on his eye. Who is he? Oh, he, uh... He's just a man your pa used to know. I want to leave here. I'd like that, too, son. But, akii, I want youto remember something. When we came here, I made a promiseto bring law and order. Soon you'll be a man, and when you are,you'll find out there are certain thingsyou have to do or you aren'ta man at all. But doc says they'll kill you. Well, I supposethey're goingto try, but... Akii, if anythinghappens to me, get on your ponyand ride eastto fort halleck. Pa, we can go away from here. We don't have to stay. It's a long ride, son, but you're almosta man now. You can hunt.You can take careof yourself. When you get tofort halleck, there's a tradingpost there run by an old mannamed Aaron. You give him this. He'll knowwho you are, and... He'll take careof you. Pa... I'm not almost a man. Son, you spendthe night here. If your pa'snot back by morning, you get on your pony, ride east,fort halleck. Travis... I'd appreciate it if you'd keep an eye on the boy while I'm gone. Be glad to, marshal. Thanks. I understand you lost some money to marlowe last night. All I had. You'll find $2,000 over in the desk drawer. You mean it? Yeah, I mean it. But you'll wish I didn't if I ever catch you gambling again. What do you think? I think he's calling your bet. Hmm. I got four guns to his one at the dam. That's what I like about you, marlowe... Always give an even chance. Hey, what's wrongwith him? He's got another one of his headaches. I'm getting sick of 'em. You want I shouldcure his headachesfor good? What part of his back would you aim at, hmm? Well, I... Frank? The marshal's coming. Howdy. We thought you had forgotten US, marshal. I haven't forgotten you, Cody. What about those others? They're staying, just like US, to see if you can deliver that water. Frankly, we don't see how, but we've nothing to lose but one day going to Oregon. I'm getting fed up with the hang-dog attitude of you and your friends. We're tired of fighting marlowe. You were brave enough to walk in here behind the army and claim this land when the blood of Indians who'd lived here a thousand years was still wet on the ground. Now somebody wants it, you're ready to run. You can't talk to US like that, squaw man. Boy, if you don't want a mouth full of boot, keep it shut. We can't farmwithout water. You'll get your water... If I can do it. Might help to know where that dam was. 6 miles north. Ride through a rocky canyon, and you'll find the creek. How many men you figure marlowe will have there? Mmm, three or four. They'll be expecting you. Uh-huh. Homesteading applications. Tell the others if the papers aren't signed by morning, the water won't do them any good. Marlowe's got an idea of filing papers in his own name. He said that? Yes, ma'am, he said that... That and a lot more. Think he'll make it, pa? He's a powerful man. What are we going to do, frank? Well, we'd be outof this valley right now if it wasn'tfor the marshal. We're gonna stay... If only to make surehe gets a decent burial. I'll keep himbusy from here long enough for youto get up aroundbehind him. Go on. All right, lawman... Just a little bit closer. [Neighing] Marshal,in back of you! Get down, boy! Yeager! Sweeney! Yeager! Yeager, sweeney! You down there? Boy, that's the second time today you almost got yourself killed. Yes, sir. When you going to learn, boy? I do have a name. Hmm? I'm glad to hear that. People call me Jimmy. Nice name, boy. There's still one of them up behind that rock. You stay put. [Rattling] Boy! Boy,get over here! Snake got me. Fix me a tourniquet,quick. Get it good and tight. Tighter. That's it. - That's it. - All right? All right.Yeah, yeah.Tie it off. Yeager! Sweeney! Yeager! Thank you, boy. Pa would've come himself, except he can't ride with that bad leg. [Gunshot] Besides, he hadto go into townin the wagon to getthose papers signed. You did wantthem signed, didn't you? Aah! Here, reload this. Give me your rifle. I'm sorry... Jimmy. Sarah! Sarah! What's the matter? They did it... Our son Jimmy and that marshal! The water? Yeah. I was just crossingthe fording point, coming back from hap kelley's. All of a sudden, I looked up, and there it came. To hear you talk, you'd think it wasthe wide Missouri. I know it's just a creek, but like this place, it's ours! The others?They'll stay, too? Yes. I've got the homestead applications all signed. Oh, frank! Oh, Sarah, this is a good country. I guess we've lived here so long, well, we've never really seen it. I've known itall along, frank. It's god's country. Oh, I betterfix supper. Shall I set a placefor the marshal? Sarah! Frank! It's Jimmy! Frank! Jimmy! Frank! Frank, it's Jimmy! Give me a hand, Sarah. [Crying] Oh, be careful! Get him up! Oh, Jimmy! From the shape he's in, that arm is just loaded with poison. We've got to do something more for him than we have, Sarah. You stay here, Sarah. What are yougoing to do? We've got to get something to draw out that poison. Cow's liver's all we got. We only got the one. It's got to be done, Sarah. Your books, Jimmy. All that working and learning... It's just like everything else now... It was for nothing. Nothing. [Gunshot] Ohh... Ohh. All right, boys, the wheel is spinning. Bet 5, win 25. Put your bets down. Here we go. And... The lucky winner is... Sweet lady of fortune! Number 6. The gentleman hereis the lucky winner. And are you ready now? I'm sorry, sir.You're the loser. And you are the winner. I can't forget to paythis gentleman. Here we go again. And the wheelis spinning. And... The lucky winner... Oh, the lucky winner,number 13. I'm so sorry, sir. Do try again,will you? Oh, there'sa lucky winner! There you are, sir. Too bad your luck's run out. We wantsome change here. Here you are. Mr. Marlowe! Where's Mr. Marlowe? What happened? Where's sweeney,adams, and Yeager? They're dead, all of 'em. Now, just a minute! I know whatyou're going to say. The marshalblew up the dam. Y-Yes, sir. How did youcome out alive? I almost didn't. Give me another glass. There you are. You ain't mad? Disappointed, browdie. When you playfor big stakes... You can't affordto lose your head. Now, finish that offand go see the doc, and he'll fix you up. Yes, sir. We've got tostop chaddock before he putsthose homestead paperson that stage. I'm gladyou're on my side. Why don't you let him get them papers on the stage? I could take some boys... Hey, hey!Look around you. You know what Wells fargomeans to these miners. What do you supposethey'd do to a man who would ambusha Wells Fargo stage? Better chance if youmurdered their mothers. Maybe you're right. People are like... Well, they're like cards. If you knowhow to shuffle them, you alwayscome out the winner. What are you going to do? Take two mento the general store. Bring back enough gunsand ammunition for every manin this room. When you get back, I'll show youhow to stack a deck of men. Let's resume the spinningof the wheel. All bets should be down. Mr. Marlowe? Chaddock opened the dam. Figured he would. You don't seemvery concerned. Marlowe, you pay for my gun... Nothing more. Open up that gun cabinet. What's going on here? Never mind! Never mind! Break out the ammunition for them rifles. And do it right now! Come on! By what right? By this right! There you are. Come on. Hurry up. Come on. Grab that ammunition. After we take care of the marshal, I'm coming back. I got a score to settle with your chinaman. He told the marshal I didn't pay for them cutters. I'm coming back. Come on. You heard what tangley said about you. Yes, Mr. Perkins. With marlowe, patch, tangley, and all those miners against him, the marshal's come up short. Look, sung li, you can take my horse and be gone by morning. Maybe we all should get out. You go, Mr. Perkins. I stay. I fight with marshal. But why? In China, we believethat when man die, god pull himto heaven by pigtail. Over here, people laugh becauseI'm different and becausei wear pigtail. But marshal... He no laugh. It all differentto him, also. He show me respect. I stay, Mr. Perkins. I stay, and I fightwith marshal. Let me get dressed, and we'll find doc Raymond. He'll know what to do. Lock up that door. Oh, Mr. Marlowe, here they are. Good. Put them on the bar. All that to kill one man? Chaddock islikely to bring a bunch ofhomesteaders with him. And you'd cut them down, too, wouldn't you? The next time chaddockrides into this town, he's dead. And that goesfor every man, woman,or child with him. Boys... Gather around here. Got a few words I want to say. Boys... When I look around this room, I see men I've grubstaked, men I've stood a meal for, the same men I play cards with and shared a bottle. I look around this room, and I see my friends. Oh, we've had good times and bad times together, and we'll stick together now! Listen to this... The big money boys up in Helena have decided to give the homesteaders your mining rights! What's the matter, you and marlowecan't kill the marshal? You need these men? Nora... I want to talk to you... In back...Now. And thisso-called marshal... I call hima hired gun! And the first thing he done was come in and beat up on poor old Travis and then put him in jail. That's right! That's right! He wants to get rid of all you miners, just like he got rid of Travis. And he will, too! He'll pick you off one at a time. I tried to reason with him. He threatened to kill me. He said nothing...Nothing is going to stop him until he gets all your claims! He ain't going to get mine! He's out there... Right now... Trying to line up the sodbusters against you. I won't have any partof marlowe's plan. Neither will I! I'm leaving gloryhole. Patch, you alwayslooked out for me in there. I'm sorry for whati said before. A man with a face like mine gets used to worse. I always thought you'dtake marlowe's partagainst the marshal. It wouldn't be quite right. He saved my life once. The marshal? It was a long time ago. I was a captain in the army then. I never knew that. We were out on patrol... Been out two weeks or so searching for a band of renegade Indians. Chaddock was my scout. So that'show you knew him. One night we were camped. One of my lookouts reported an Indian village just over the hill. Chaddock insisted they were friendly. I'd been a captain for 10 years, and I wanted a promotion. I guess I felt... Just like marlowe does in there right now. I wanted glory. I'd been small-time for so long. This was my chance. Nobody was going to stand in my way. But chaddock tried. I had him placed under guard and planned the attack. At dawn, we...We rode down. The village was just waking, and at first, some of the Indians... They seemed friendly. Why didn'tyou stop right then? It was too late. My men were already firing. The... The braves, they ran for cover or weapons. The squaws ran for the young. And the young... The young... They just looked up... Unafraid. Unbelieving. Patch... How awful. 203 men, women, and children were killed. I had those awful nightmares afterwards... Till they finally stopped. Until today... Today...today... When I saw chaddock's boy. You said chaddocksaved your life. He testified against me. I was dishonorably discharged. The day I left the fort, that band of renegades we'd been chasing captured me. And he rescued youfrom them? Not until I'd been tortured. Each scar is a life. Two days and two nights, and they weren't even half through when he found me. For five years, I've wanted to kill him. I blamed everything that happened to me on him. When you sawchaddock's son, that changed your mind? Yeah, the kid brought back the nightmares. All those years, it wasn't chaddock I hated... It was me. What happenedthat makes youturn against marlowe? Marlowe. Marlowe, I... I now see myself. For the first time, I...i know what caused the nightmare. Greed... Hate... The... Desperation. I can't stay here. And you don't belong here, either. Now, I'm not asking you to be my wife or anything like that, but, please, just... Just let me help you. Let me help someone. Stay and help chaddock. I can't. That's impossible. That's what I told him, but he told Mei could teach again. Before he left, he said, "if I don't come back, "talk to my boy. Let him hold youfor a while." Does the greed and hatealways have to win out? There'll be a dozen guns against him. The homesteaders,won't they be with him? Maybe. Even so, he doesn't stand half a chance. Did he ever? Well, that's the picture. The marshal and the sodbusters. You can let them cheat you and Rob you of everything you got... Or we can fight! Now, I'm with you! Are you with me? - Yeah! - Yeah! All right! Now, pick out your rifles, your ammunition, and the drinks are on the house. You sure stackeda deck of miners. Poor dumb slobs. Hey, where's patch? I don't know. I want him ready when that marshal rides into town. Take two men, post them outside of town, then clear the streets. I don't want to see anything... Men, dogs, horses... Just chaddock. Yes, sir. Little fella... All tuckered out waiting for your pa. [Door rattles] Who's out there? It's me...Nora. It's open. What do you want, patch? We've come to help, Travis. I don'tneed your help. The marshal will, when he gets here. I sure would hateto pull this trigger. It might wake the boy. He shouldn't be sleeping over there. I'm fixin' toput him to bed when you two leave. Since we're not leaving, I better move him. Touch him, and i'llblow a hole in you big enough todrive a coach through. Rep marlowe's got a saloon full of angry guns. One of US better stay on watch to keep an eye on them. It'll be easier if that boy's in bed where he belongs. Patch... This is the endof the nightmare. All right, you'vedone your good deed. Now, get out of here. Now, are you going to stop pointing that rifle at me? How do I knowit's loaded? See for yourself. Now, got any coffee? Fixin's are over there. I'll make some coffee. [Clang] What happened? He'll be all right. We almost lost him once during the night. He's a hard man to kill. I was dreamingabout Jimmy, frank. He was 10. His hairwas so yellow. I'm going out tobury him now, Sarah. It was his birthday... And you came home, and he'd let the pigs out. He was playing with 'em and chasing 'em. You were so angry. You said he'd run good meat off of 'em. They'd trampled your fields. It was his birthday... And you strapped him. Not without good reason, frank. He came to me and cried. He came to me. I'll come back and get youwhen I'm finished. We'll say wordsover him together. Mmm. His hair was so yellow. Thought marlowe'dmiss US before now. Would you like me to watch a while? No. They've quieted downover at the saloon. They're waiting forchaddock to come back. How about you, Travis? You in it to the end? Pa! Pa! It's all right, honey. We're friends of your father. That's right, boy. That man... He tried to shoot my pa. It was a mistake. A mistake I'll never make again. He means it, honey. My name is akii, not honey. Oh, I'm sorry, akii. And I'm miss Johnson, your new schoolteacher. Schoolteacher? I don't need a schoolteacher. My pa taught me to read and write, add and subtract, and he even taught me some geog... Geography? I know that, too. How long till sun comes up? Not long. If my pa isn't back by morning, I'm to ride to fort halleck. He'll be back, akii. May I go back to sleep now? Would you like me tostay with you a while? I'm almost a man now. I don't need anyone to look after me. Maybe I am only a saloon woman. Miss Johnson? Miss Johnson? Did that soundlike a saloon? Go on, schoolteacher. You got yourselfa pupil. Yes, akii. I'm here. Marlowe will never let you put those applications on the stage. Your son died for this land. I wish you'd nevercome to this valley. I take it, Cody, that, uh, you're not coming with me? What good would I be? Yesterday I sent my sonto do my job. With this arm and leg,I'd be in the way. Yeah, you might be at that. Mr. Marlowe. He's coming. The marshal's coming. All right, boys,you know what to do. Boy, your father will be back soon. [Dog barks] Oh, pa, I knew you'd be back. Ahh! Not all the way back yet, son. Here, you carry that. Not all the way back until I deliver some papers to the stagecoach. I kind of figuredyou'd be back. I thought you'd be bringingsome homesteaders with you. Yeah, I did, too. Well, I don't know where they went, but a minute ago, a little rag-bag army came out of the saloon. Those papers really that important? Yeah, they are. From the looks of things, you'll need some help. I figured you'd be over there with marlowe. A 10-year-old changed my mind. He means it, but just two of you, you don't have a prayer. I'm with you,marshal. You don't have to, Travis. Yes, I do. What do you think? Well, I think our prayer is getting bigger. So marlowe's got a rag-bag army staked out, huh? Like all gamblers, he wants an edge. We could use an ace ourselves. Got any ideas? Yeah. There's an old buckboard out back. You give patch a hand. Load it up with that whole rack of rifles we've got inside. Save the time it takes to reload, huh? Empty one gun, pick upa fresh one. Good. We'll use the back door. Marlowe won't tip his hand, we don't tip ours. Hello, Mr. Chaddock. Oh, hello, sung li. Do you have trouble? Yeah. Is there somethingi can do to help? No, nothing, sung li. Nothing. Just, uh... Hang onto your pigtail. I have idea. Oh, I...I getmr. Perkins, too. I thought you told me that patch is over there in front of the sheriff's office. Well, he was,with Nora and the kid. Now he's probablyin there with Travis. Stinking turncoat. You fellas waiting for somebody? Yeah, we're waiting to put chaddock in a pine box. I have to agree. He doesn't have much chance against you and all those miners. You go over and tell that to your friend chaddock. Tell him to give me those homestead claims. There'll be no argument. All right, marlowe, I'll do it. You ask me, he ain't going tocome over here and dump them claimsin your lap. He will if he has any sense. What are you goingto do about him after youget the claims? Then? Then we kill him... Him and patch. And if doc and Travis don't like it... Marlowe, Travis is a friend of mine. So is doc. Don't ask US to be a part of any shooting at them. All right. You and your people just... You just shoot at chaddock and patch. [Door opens] Oh, you, doc. I come tothrow in with you. You took your sweet time getting here. Marlowe told meto tell you you haven'tgot a chance. Maybe. What's all that stuffout there? That's either an ace in the hole or a hole in the ground... One for each of US. First, I'm going to talk to marlowe. Oh, don't risk it. Well, maybe we canavoid this whole thing. Just in case, doc, see that the rest ofthese rifles get ready. Pa... Son, you stay with miss Johnson. Told you. Doc talked some sense into him. Have you got the claims? I came to talk. Talking isall over with. The claims. I'll go get them. Ah, he knows when he's whipped. Maybe somebodyought to tell him. Look! Well, they gone loco. Chaddock just picked out his pine box. Get that wagon over here. Let's put him in it, eh? [Gunshots] Must bethem homesteaders. Homesteaders, hell! Those are firecrackers! Drop those guns or you're both dead! Drop 'em! Now, get over here! Cover me. Marlowe? Pa! Tell that stage driver to stop at my officeon his way out of town. We've got toget those claims to the registrar'soffice in Helena. Pa! You hurt? No, I'm all right, just a little shaky. Pa, why did ithave to happen, sung li and allthose people dead? Because a man got greedy, son. Come on, schoolteacher.
