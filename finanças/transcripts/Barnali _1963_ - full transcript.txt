Cordial invitation. On the twenty sixth of next month.. ..tenth of June, Wednesday my only daughter Kalyani.. ..is getting married to Mr. Shaileshwar.. ..son of late. Mr. Surandranath Ghosh. ..resident of 25/2, Suresh Mollik street.. ..Gondolpara, Chandanagore. You are humbly requested to be present on the.. ..aforesaid date and bless the newly-wed couple. R.S.V.P. Trideepchandra Sarkar. Do you understand the condition.. ..of this R.S.V.P. Trideepchandra Sarkar? Only two and half days are left. And you got the cards printed today! Sir, finding the card took time. Finding the card took time in the city of Kolkata? No, sir. Had to bring from Bombay by air parcel, sir. Look here, what a velvet finish, sir. This kind of card had come to Kolkata only for once. For the wedding of sir Gopen's niece. We supplied, it sir. - Enough! Showing me card! Five hundred cards have to be distributed now! They are not Tom, Dick and Harry like you! If the least of mistake happens in the invitation.. ..that's it; I won't be getting even one tender for the year. What's the matter? Next Wednesday is my daughter's wedding. Your presence is requested at my house that evening, sir. But, I don't go anywhere for social invitations, Mr. Trideep. You'll have to keep my request, sir. - You know what. All the tenders for next year have been called. Now if I go for any function to any of the parties (clients).. ..there are other contractors; they could think otherwise. Shame.. shame.. shame; even listening to this is a big sin, sir. A religious man like you will go and bless my daughter. Why is the tender being involved in this, sir? All right, I will try but I cannot promise. No, sir not try you will have to come for once. My house is towards the station.. ..from the turning at Dhakuria.. - I know.. I know.' I do visit that place sometime. Okay, sir. Okay, sir so then I will leave. - Bye. Mr. Chaudhary? - No he has not come back from court yet. Oh I see. Well next Wednesday evening is Mr. Trideep Sarkar's.. ..daughter's wedding at his place. So the four of you, means you both and your sons. Be there for the wedding and have dinner. Here is your card. Oh, next Wednesday evening? - 'Yes, sir.' Isn't the next one number forty one; Mr. Nagen's house? No, that is seventeen by two; Sudhanshu Gupta's house. Oh I see. The numbers are messy here in your locality. Yes that is. - Okay I'll leave. Gentleman, where is house number forty one? No idea. Gentleman. - Yes tell me? Where is house number forty one? - Number forty one? Yes old garden? - Straight ahead there's a lane on right. It's on that lane. - On the lane. Well, number forty one is found at last. 'Who's it?' As are the streets so are the numbers. After five is twenty five, after twenty five is thirty seven. Next Wednesday, you both husband wife and both your daughters.. Whom do you want? Oh ho. No I mean, you both sisters, and your parents.. Trideep Sarkar of house number one.. ..his daughter's wedding at his house; you all are invited. We are invited.. ..in Mr. Trideep's house? Yes. Your card.. Perhaps I've forgotten the card. Okay I'll bring it later. The thing is that you all are coming next Wednesday. And you'll be kind to have dinner there. You come inside; I'll call father. Be seated. Father. - 'What is it?' Come for a while. - 'Coming.' What's the matter? - He is saying something. 'Greetings.' - Greetings. But why are you standing? Be seated. - No I won't sit now. Next Wednesday is Mr. Trideep's daughter's wedding. Oh. - You all; you both husband wife and both.. ..your daughters are invited for dinner at Mr. Trideep's place. Very well; this is very happy news! But I forgot your card. - What's the need of the card? You people have invited we'll certainly go. - Okay. Mr. Trideep's daughter's wedding? - Yes, madam. That house number one? - Yes.. yes. Are you Mr. Trideep's relative? Yes I am Mr. Trideep's.. Means Mr. Trideep is my uncle. - Oh ho.. ho. Okay I'll leave. - Okay.. okay. It's surprising even to think. A man like Mr. Trideep has invited you? Even if he is a wealthy man, he's not proud. - It may be so. But it doesn't seem that he would know your name? Well, he may not know that. But I think he has invited everyone in the locality. So he got the names of everyone from someone. Would be so. At least fifty people were hunting for their daughters. Is it an easy job to snatch the groom from them? But I got some relief. I heard that Shaileshwar is a friend of my sister-in-law's son Ashesh. I took advantage of this opportunity.. ..and I enticed them that I'll pay all the money for the foreign trip. That's it; the fish was hooked! Hey, tell aunt to send some tea! I'm tired of walking. You got so late? - Won't I get late? The old garden street is a riddle. And the most difficult was to find Mr. Nagen of number forty one. Did you go to Mr. Nagen's house? - Yes. You didn't meet him; was Mr. Nagen's wife at home? Yes Mr. Nagen's wife was there, Mr. Nagen's daughter was there. But I didn't meet you? 'I left house just now and came straight here.' How is this possible? Did you go to house number forty one? Yes. I guess you didn't go to house number one of forty one. Husband wife and two daughters. No, sir. Then I perhaps made a mistake. Comedy of errors! Anyway, finally it's known that the four.. ..people from my house have been invited. You do not worry for the formality in vain. No.. no, is that ever possible?! One has to be given the prestige that one deserves. Otherwise it is self disrespect. Ashesh, take one more trouble. - Tell me? You go to Mr. Nagen's house right now. Meet his wife and give the invitation formally. Well that house number one of forty one. Which side is your house from that? - On the left. On the left. - There's a garage on the side. You'll recognize it on seeing. Okay then I'll leave, Mr. Trideep. - Listen.. listen. Well the gentleman who got invited by mistake. I mean who lives in house number one of forty one. It seems that you know him. Who is the man? I mean is he respectable enough to have my invitation? Respectable, means.. - Does he pay income tax? I mean is he quite well to do? - Just the opposite. What?! - You mean a cheap man? Ordinary poor gentleman; lives in a rented house. Perhaps he is a teacher. Okay I'll leave. Shame, Ashesh. Did you really mind it? Yes I did a little. Four cheap people will come and have dinner at my place. This is certainly not any matter of concern for me. The question is about my prestige. Look, it's my minor mistake. I know perhaps it would have been laughed at a little. But you're thinking about prestige.. You're not able to understand, Ashesh. Why should I invite just anyone? This Mr. Nagen, I invited him; but why? He is the income tax inspector. So I keep flattering him. Because it's unpredictable when I'll need his help. If I invite someone in vain whom I don't need.. ..then he will think that I'm flattering him! What's the harm in that? - Much harm. It will harm my prestige. It will harm the prestige of the.. ..reputed women who'll come to my house. And it will harm the teacher as well. A false pride will be injected into him. I didn't know, the rules of the world are so distinctive. You didn't know that's why you made a mistake. Now go and mend the mistake. How? Go to that teacher's house and.. ..tell him that he was invited by mistake. This doesn't look good, uncle. If you argue I'll again suffer inconvenience, Ashesh. Why should I invite someone, whom I don't need? Moreover if there is no motive in the actions and.. ..speech of people then it is considered insanity. Okay. All right I'll go and say. Who's it? Kindly will you call your father for once? Father! - 'What is it?' What's the matter? Hey, you? So why are you standing outside, son? No I'll say something and go that's why.. That's why you are standing outside? Well how foolish you are. Come.. come; come inside. Come.. come. Come and sit. Come. Hey, bring tea. Sit.. sit.. sit. The reason I came back, is actually.. 'Why are you being so impatient?' Have some tea, relax. Then I'll hear everything. - Tea? Yes. - Tea at this unusual time? Oh no.. no this is not an unusual time. The tea was ready. At night I don't take anything apart from tea and a piece of bread. You know it's better to eat the minimum at this age. What you said is almost right. I know a little about all these matters; I'm a doctor. 'Oh I see!' So; now understand if I say right or not. They think that I eat less deliberately. But there should be a limit to eating less. Only a cup of tea and a bread will increase.. ..the chances of low blood pressure. Now? - Now what? I can tell about your bad habit as well. Well I remember. Your name.. - Ashesh Rai. Okay, Ashesh you say, is it good for health.. ..to keep awake and study till late at night? Certainly not. Well what's the reason to keep awake.. ..and study so late at night? She is appearing for B.A. exams this year. She's doing her honors in philosophy. Tea is over. Now about the disobedience.. ..of my younger daughter Triloka.. - No. This girl is very disobedient you know. She can dance very well. So I say that if you dance like that without drinking milk.. ..properly then you'll fall sick. Isn't it so? - That's true. You know, son I respect your uncle a lot. Well, some people say that he is a very egoistic man. But I don't feel so at all. If it is so than why would he invite a man like me? 'Like this Biman Chaudhary an ordinary man.. ..for his daughter's wedding?' Look, the matter for which I came, is.. ..I mean.. I mean..there has been a very embarrassing mistake. I invited you all by mistake. You people have no invitation to Trideep Sarkar's house. I mistook yours for Mr. Nagen's house.. - 'Oh say that!' What's there to be so embarrassed, son? No.. no you don't be embarrassed at all. Hey everyone could make this mistake. Look, you go and tell your uncle.. ..that we won't mind anything. No. Okay. Okay so I'll leave today. - Okay, son. Bye.. bye. How funny. Look she's laughing. Come, let's go inside. 'Hey will the tent be done properly?' 'Don't worry at all, sir.' The way I'll make it, people will be wonderstruck. Take care, man; all reputed people have been invited. Master's reputation shouldn't get harmed in front of them. Don't worry at all, you may leave. Hey Gedu, son, pull it and tie it. 'Leave the middle one, son. Why didn't you bring Korunno?' 'Bring two extra men and wrap the bamboos.' 'Leave a hole in between; chandeliers will hang there.' 'Pull a little, son.' 'No matter what you people say, sister-in-law.' 'I had been to so many wedding houses.' 'But I have not seen anybody who bought such nice things.' Look here; this set alone costs three thousand rupees. Don't forget whose daughter is getting married. Brother says; if people don't get dazzled.. ..then what is the need to spend money?' Here you are, Ashesh. I was searching for you. Look, we won't get time to breathe tomorrow morning. So I was thinking of sitting with you and.. ..decide how to welcome the guests tomorrow. Okay, you go I'll come. And yes look it's good that you cancelled.. ..the invitation to the teacher, understand. If a cheap man would have entered among so many respectable guests.. ..the situation would have become very delicate, isn't it? Okay then you come. 'Excuse me.' - Who's it? You; at this hour? I was compelled to come and disturb you again. I'll say a few simple words and go away. People get annoyed if you come to say.. ..even a few simple words at midnight. I know that. And moreover I came prepared for your rude words. Saying the truth is not rude words, Mr. Ashesh. Okay look, in the time you took to say so much.. ..I'd have finished speaking by that time. And I could have gone with peacefully. Tell me? Tomorrow you people please come to our house in Alipore. Why? - You people are invited. Invited? - Yes. Why? - Ah.. assume that it's just like that. My sister Sudha's birthday happened a few days ago. Anyway I'll make an excuse and say on the occasion of Sudha's birthday. Look, Mr. Ashesh perhaps you think you are very clever. Yes.. yes.. Suddenly? You believe that on getting invited.. ..at rich people's place like you.. ..people like us will immediately run for eating. Look.. well, people like you often come to our house? Now my sister Sudha; her new friends always keep coming. And I too go to so many places and eat. What's extraordinary about this? But why are you inviting me? You can understand; because of my mistake.. ..the insult you people faced today.. Insult? What insult? I invited and then backed off. It's a shame. We'll be belittled on not getting.. ..an invitation from Trideep Sarkar's house? We don't have such strange beliefs. I'm unable to make you understand my point properly. What do I gain by understanding your point? You'll go to our house. Look I am just a messenger. It's uncle's daughter's wedding. He'll decide whom to invite and whom not to. I'm just supposed to do as I am ordered. That's why you got upset. - Correct. So then say that you'll come to our house. Instead.. instead if I say that rather you.. ..come to our house and eat something? Very well, fine. - Fine. Then you are invited tomorrow. Okay. But tell me that you.. I mean you people.. ..don't have anymore misconceptions about me. No. - Okay then I'll leave. 'Listen, Mr. Ashesh.' Want to say something? Will you surely come tomorrow? - Yes of course. But I won't be present tomorrow. - You may not. But I will come on time eat and go away. You'll come even after knowing I won't be present. Yes, of course. It's very late night, Mr. Ashesh. - Oh yes; I'll leave. Look at this; this is called fortune. I didn't expect to see you here and you yourself.. ..stood beside me and supervised my meal. And the people with whom you hoped to chat so much.. ..you didn't see them on coming here. Really, I completely forgot that today we are.. ..supposed to go to maternal uncle's place. But I invited you; so I was compelled to stay back. Got punished for inviting by mistake. Oh wow; why punished? While going father and mother told me.. ..that you shouldn't mind anything. Oh what a trouble! Why should I mind! I relished so much with pleasure. Moreover I got an excuse for coming once more. Do you need an excuse for coming once again? Of course I do. The way you made me nervous last night. So tell me what should I do? A gentleman whom I got introduced to only a few hours back.. ..if he comes to the window at midnight, then.. ..he should be handed over to police. You tell me, isn't it suspicious? Well, I don't understand one thing. Why did you invite me after getting angry? When I understood that you are feeling.. ..bad for an ordinary mistake. Just that? Not just that. I saw.. I saw that you are a very simple person. That means? That means I don't need to be afraid of hearing anything bad from you. What bad, Aloka Chaudhary? Something that a person like you.. ..should not say to a person like me. Now I understand. I see you are a very serious kind of student. Remains buried in books day and night. - Certainly not. But these thick books are not supporting your words. Shaileshwar Ghosh? Which Shaileshwar Ghosh is this? Dr. Shaileshwar Ghosh. No.. no I too know a Dr. Shaileshwar Ghosh. Lives on Suresh Mollik street. - You know the right man. But.. but your acquaintance with him..? Is he some relative of yours? Not yet, but soon he will be. How come? I mean.. I'll get married to him. Get married? How come? As every marriage happens. No I mean.. I am Shaileshwar's friend but I don't know. You will come to know when the time comes. Do your parents know about this? Yes. This marriage is happening with father's will. May I ask you something? - Tell me? How long have you known Shaileshwar? How did you come to know him? Mr. Shaileshwar was my father's student. Hence he often used to visit our house. To discuss the thesis. So what if my father is an ordinary school teacher? In knowledge and wisdom he is better than many others. Then? Father and Mr. Shaileshwar used to.. ..discuss so much about the points of the thesis. And I use to sit and listen. I used to feel.. I used to feel if I could.. ..provide any help in this great cause.. ..then I will consider myself worthy. Coming to know about your feelings.. ..Shaileshwar must have jumped with joy. Exactly. What help did you provide? I brought so many good reference books.. ..from the National library. - And? Kept awake at night and copied the notes of thesis. And? - I even typed the manuscript of the file. Then? Then. Then it was the day of submitting the thesis. That day we were so happy. We were returning home in a taxi. 'Today everything looks good to me.' 'The evening sky, the trees out there; everything.' 'You've become a poet in a day I see.' 'Why not?' 'Today you've submitted the thesis.' 'And a couple of days later, you'll be Dr. Shaileshwar Ghosh.' 'Come on, let's celebrate this day.' 'Fine, come to our house; I'll cook delicious mutton for you.' 'Not to your house. Let's go somewhere else. - Where?' 'Let's go.. to my flat.' 'Why there?' 'It's so inconvenient to find you alone in your house.' 'Moreover, you never saw how my house and things are.' 'I will see one day for sure.' 'So let your flat remain unknown for these few days.' 'You'll see one day; but seeing today is all wrong.' 'Moreover, nobody is there at my house.' 'We both could.. chat in privacy.' 'What; shall I ask to turn the car?' - 'No.' 'Oh.' 'So this is how much you trust me?' 'Mr. Shaileshwar, why are you spoiling.. ..this very joyous day in this way?' 'That day I could not keep his wish.' 'My heart got filled with some unknown suspicion.' I could not go. - Then? After that day Mr. Shaileshwar didn't.. ..come to our house even for once. Didn't you ever go to enquire? I wrote a letter. Didn't get any reply. Does your father know this? No. He still believes Mr. Shaileshwar will keep his promise. Well, you are Mr. Shaileshwar's friend. If I make you a request.. ..will you think I'm very shameless? What request? If you talk to Mr. Shaileshwar.. ..if you go and tell him, that Aloka wants to know.. ..how long does she need to keep waiting like this. The marriage could have happened this month. If the marriage doesn't happen this month, what's the harm? 'If the marriage never happens?' - Mr. Ashesh! 'Wait.' Going away without saying anything? When I won't be of any help to you; so.. You'll say a few words to Mr. Shaileshwar on my behalf. Is this very difficult? Yes. Very difficult. Fried mixture. Fried mixture. Ashesh you. Come.. come; come in. Come in.. come in.. come in. So then, what's the news? You are not to be seen. Whether I'm to be seen or not you'll see on your wedding. Sit.. sit.. sit. Tell me what will you have; coffee, tea? No thanks. - Okay, you sit; I'll come in a moment. So then, Ashesh; tell me what's the news? Come on, have a cigarette. You look very happy? - Shouldn't I look happy? After all I'm getting a wealthy father-in-law! Well, Shaileshwar. - 'Yes?' Do you know someone called Biman Chaudhary in Old garden street? Biman Chaudhary? I heard you were his student in school. Oh, teacher? Yes.. yes.. yes; I know. Then you must know his daughter Aloka Chaudhary? Why this topic suddenly? No just like that. Oh. I know. I know means, I used to go to their house sometimes. 'Radio Kolkata.' - Then the girl served me tea a few times. 'Sitar was being played by..' - Then we got acquainted. 'Indronil Bhattacharya.' - Nothing else? But Mr. Biman believes that you will marry his daughter. This is wrong of them, Ashesh. If I have tea a few times in some house and.. ..they think that I will relieve them of their daughters.. ..then I could not, go anywhere. And if you yourself have promised the girl? - That's a lie. They could not prove this anyhow. No, of course they could not. If you had said something to some girl.. ..in the colorful light of a taxi in the evening.. ..then only your prudence could have proven it. And I feel you've suppressed that because.. ..you are getting a wealthy father-in-law. Okay, I'll leave. Wait, Ashesh. I hope you won't tell your uncle about these false rumors. No.. no; don't be afraid of that. And even if I say why should he believe it? Just as you want to get a wealthy father-in-law.. ..he too wants to get a doctorate son-in-law. So that his reputation grows a little more. Okay. Greetings. - Greetings. Are you fine? Come. - Welcome.. welcome. Welcome.. welcome. Brought your son? He's out of station. - Oh I see.. I see. Welcome. Welcome. - Has the groom come? It's time now. Welcome.. welcome. Listen, take them inside. Come. Welcome, sir. I'm so fortunate that you've come to my house today. But Mrs. Mukherjee didn't come? - She is not well. Oh ho. Welcome.. welcome. Come.. come. Come, sir.. come this way. Come. Have a seat. Look at the flattery. - Flattery! It's grand flattery. Without flattery he won't be getting that.. ..contract worth one lakh rupees. I myself will serve your dinner, sir. I won't take even a sweet, Mr. Trideep. Outside home I don't eat anything at all. Look at me and have a little pity, sir. - No, gentleman. I couldn't kill myself by taking pity on you. I fall ill even if I smell the food of a Bengali invitation. So then.. Ah ha.. ha what are you doing, gentleman? A fan is already there above my head. No, sir it's very hot. - Moreover I'll leave in a while. I've to meet an honorable gentleman in your locality. You'll meet him here, sir. All the honorable gentlemen of the locality.. ..have been invited; nobody is left out. Oh, so Mr. Biman is coming here. What's the name you said, sir? Mr. Biman? Yes; Biman Chaudhary. But I don't remember anyone by that name.. ..who has been invited. So what's the use of waiting in vain? Come on; let me bless your daughter. And proceed to Mr. Biman's house. Ashesh. 'Listen.. listen, come here.' Tell me what is the matter? An honorable gentleman named Mr. Biman.. ..living in our locality didn't get invited? Who Mr. Biman; that school teacher Mr. Biman? Yes, the school teacher Biman Chaudhary. I call him Debotullo (God like) Chaudhary. Quite a few years ago, I was coming to.. ..the Kolkata head office from our factory in Agartala. After getting down from train and boarding the taxi.. ..I found my cash bag was not with me. Gentlemen, I kept blabbering like a mad man whole night. 'In the morning I saw an unknown gentleman.. ..had come to meet me; my cash bag was with him.' 'Not a paisa missing.' I wanted to give him a reward of five thousand rupees.. ..and found that such a man is still there on earth. He must have not taken that reward money for sure? That's what I am saying. Such a God like man is in your locality and you don't.. ..even know about him, Mr. Trideep? Surprising. No.. no why wouldn't I know, sir? I didn't understand initially that you are.. ..talking about our respected teacher. Ashesh himself had gone and invited him. No I didn't. What?! What are you saying; why? You know better why I didn't invite him. Did you see, sir; how these boys make mistakes? What a terrible mistake. Anyway, gentleman I'm going to Mr. Biman myself. You please sit for a little while more, sir. I myself will go to respected Mr. Biman. Ashesh made mistake. I'll apologize for that.. ..and bring him here right away. Leave it; you don't need to take the trouble. Moreover not.. ..only Mr. Biman; I need to meet his daughter also. All of them are coming, sir! I myself will bring them in my car. I'll make them meet you, will serve dinner myself. And then I'll drop them home myself. You please be kind and sit for a little more while, sir. Tables are ready; should I make people sit? Yes.. yes make them sit. Welcome, Mr. Biman. 'Today I'll introduce you to such a person.. ..that you will be completely surprised.' - Aloka? 'Is it so?' 'Aloka.' That' why I wondered, who's calling Aloka here. You people here? Your uncle insisted so much.. ..that there was no way to refuse. Triloka and mother have not come back yet. So I had to come with father. - I have something to tell you. Tell me? - Can't say it here; come let's go outside. Let's go outside; nearby. Come. - Come. Tell me what you want to say. Come on, let's take a walk. Suddenly? Just like that. That means? - No it means.. it means.. I have not told my story to you. But I heard your story. Is this story time? - When will be the time for it then? But what will you gain by telling your story to me? So then why did you tell me your story? What gain did you expect? My story is full of sorrows. Your story doesn't have sorrows for sure I guess. If I say it does? Then what will I gain by hearing your sorrows? I couldn't find any solution. There comes the groom I suppose. Yes perhaps the groom has come. - Wow; let's go. I've come to the wedding and shouldn't I see the groom? Rather you don't see him. Tell me what your intention is. I request you. You've nothing to do in the wedding. Rather.. Rather? - Rather if you trust me and take a walk.. ..somewhere far off then you'll be benefited. Mr. Ashesh, you are daring too much! Let's go. I request you. What? Come on, let's go to my house. Your house is certainly a very big house? Not very small. Certainly very beautiful? Yes, you may say that. Decorated with so many expensive accessories? Yes that's right. So you believe that Biman Chaudhary's daughter.. ..Aloka Chaudhary will get impressed with your house? Certainly not. I don't believe that Aloka Chaudhary is such an ordinary girl. You.. you've put me at great inconvenience. - Why? If a girl goes out with a gentleman.. ..whom she knows for just one day.. ..then what will the gentleman think about the girl.. ..and what would the girl think about herself? If you believe me; that gentleman will.. ..not think anything at all about that girl. And will not say anything as such.. ..to the girl which disrespects her. Then? No, then there's no point in letting it grow. There is. You don't understand now; you'll understand later. It seems as if you are trying to give some news? Yes of course, news. News about Mr. Shaileshwar? Yes.. yes news about Mr. Shaileshwar. Not bad news I suppose? No why bad news? - So then? So then did you meet him? No I didn't meet him but.. - But? But I got news. - What news? I won't tell the news here. And if you do not agree to me, then I won't tell at all. Fine, let's go. What's the time? Half past seven. Half past seven? Yes, perhaps the groom has now sat on the dais. Why are you so serious? I was thinking. What? What is it about Mr. Shaileshwar.. ..that you had to bring me out of the wedding venue? If not.. - If not? No, Mr. Ashesh; I trust Mr. Shaileshwar. At least he will not break my trust. He is so shy, what should I tell you? The day he came to see Nomi, I said; Shaileshwar.. ..ask the girl whatever you want to ask without hesitation. Oh dear forget about asking. He himself sat quiet looking downwards as if he is the girl. Come. Come upstairs. Come. Be seated. You sit for a while I'll come in a moment. - But.. You please sit; I'll come in a moment. Why have you brought me here?! What do you want to do?! - What.. what are you saying? I want to know what is your motive behind bringing me here! 'Where're you, Ashesh?' 'Here, Minudi.' Look, didn't I guess right? Really, it seems you got scared. But it's not my fault; it's because of them. Said just coming.. just coming and took so long. This Rama takes twenty minutes only to wipe his face. Certainly not. Tell me what to do? I was cooking; can't leave it halfway. What's your name? Aloka. Please don't mind, Aloka. No.. why should I mind? - Seeing Ashesh's deeds. He has invited you; but nothing is arranged here. Mother has taken all the maids and servants.. ..with her for working in the wedding house. This is Minudi; sister of our locality. But she is not any less than my own sister. And this one is Rama, and this is Bina. My sisters from the locality. But in what way are they less than my real sister?. The thing is that you never forget.. ..to bring spiced peanuts for Sudha. And for us; never ever. Sudha would have answered this if she had been here. Anyway, Minudi you take a little trouble. - What? You make and serve tea to her. - And both of us? You both.. Okay you go and cook food. And Rama.. ..let Rama sing and impress Aloka Chaudhary completely. As you wish. Come. Tell me why did you get so impatient and called them? I called them because I thought that.. ..on seeing the house empty you may perhaps.. You should have told me for what you've brought me. Then the trouble would have been over! Of course I'll say that. But you came to my house for the first time. But the house is empty. Just so that you don't feel uncomfortable.. Rather say the truth! Am I not saying that? - No. You've called them because you'll be uncomfortable. &quot;Who are you, wild deer, in the garden of the heart?&quot; &quot;Suddenly you lost way and came close today.&quot; &quot;Who are you, wild deer, in the garden of the heart?&quot; &quot;Suddenly you lost way and came close today.&quot; &quot;Who are you, wild deer?&quot; &quot;So many women desired; but couldn't get you.&quot; &quot;You couldn't be acquired.&quot; &quot;So many women desired; you but couldn't get you.&quot; &quot;I wonder what the occasion is today.. ..you offered yourself.&quot; &quot;What language gets written in both the eyes in your ignorance?&quot; &quot;What language gets written in both the eyes in your ignorance?&quot; &quot;Who are you, wild deer, in the garden of the heart?&quot; &quot;Suddenly you lost way and came close today.&quot; &quot;Who are you, wild deer?&quot; &quot;It feels surprising to think about the ways of the heart.&quot; &quot;Why does it go missing ahead of dreams?&quot; &quot;It feels surprising to think about the ways of the heart.&quot; &quot;Why does it go missing ahead of dreams?&quot; &quot;A moment brings an ultimate meeting like this.&quot; &quot;Brings meeting.&quot; &quot;A moment brings ultimate meeting like this.&quot; &quot;Bud-like eyelids preserve everything within the soul.&quot; &quot;Tell me where will you roam with the anklets of love?&quot; &quot;Tell me where will you roam with the anklets of love?&quot; &quot;Who are you, wild deer, in the garden of the heart?&quot; &quot;Suddenly you lost way and came close today.&quot; &quot;Who are you, wild deer?&quot; Wow; magnificent! - 'Hey, you all come to this room!' Come on, dear. Is Sudha there? I'm Ashesh. Hey Sudha, listen there's a gentleman.. ..named Biman Chaudhary downstairs. Ask uncle, he'll tell you. He has a thick moustache. Yes listen, tell him that his daughter Aloka Chaudhary.. ..had a headache; I have dropped her home. 'Aloka Chaudhary; who is she?' I told you Biman Chaudhary's daughter. 'What, brother; love affair or what?' - Being naughty? Ashesh brother, the tea is getting cold; come quickly! You'll have to eat everything. For you, Rama. You take. I won't have. - You won't? Have it, Aloka. What's the use of getting angry on Ashesh? This is his habit. Forgets even after inviting. Now he does; but he won't forget anymore after a few more days. I'll leave now, brother. - Why so early? Again it will start raining; I shall flee before that. And we had tea, got introduced to Aloka. I'll leave, Aloka. Okay? I'm very pleased to meet you. And you also endured our hospitality with pleasure. 'This is what we wished.' The actual days of hospitality are still to come. Ah, don't tell everything now, Rama. Let the day come, then. Okay, I'll leave. - Okay, we'll leave, dear. Whatever happened here since I came here.. ..I didn't like any of that! - W.. w.. why.. why? What's the matter? Your Minudi, Rama, Bina.. ..their way of talking is not good at all! I don't know. I don't understand why you didn't like their way of talking. In my opinion there is no girl so decent.. ..with such a beautiful nature in our locality. Did I.. did I say that? - Then? Nothing. Now if you'll be kind to arrange.. ..my return, I will be obliged. You'll go? But, the sky doesn't seem to be calm. There may be a storm. Couldn't you stay back a little more? - No. I'll have to go right now. You'll go without the news about Shaileshwar? You do not have any news about Mr. Shaileshwar. If you had known you'd have certainly told me by now. So that means I was cheating you till now? It's better you yourself decide that! Oh dear! It seems you are very angry. So I must arrange for your return. Rama, how come you're here? I forgot my handkerchief on the table. Oh you forgot so take it. Will you arrange for my return or not?! Let's go; my car is parked outside. Thank you. Calling a taxi for me will be enough. Let's go. Ramlal. Ramlal. - 'Sir?' Didn't I ask you to stay here? - I was at home, sir. Go and call a taxi. - Okay. He was at home till now? - Yes he was here. The driver was here, the gardener was here. But.. Did you think that I left you alone in this unknown house and went away? I need to apologize to you. Apologize for what? I've told you a lot of things that no gentleman should endure. You can understand easily that I am not gentleman. That means you are still angry. - Why shouldn't I? I insisted so much that don't go now, it's going to rain. But no, you've to go right now. Go; now go in the rain, huh. Well.. your Minudi is also not being serious. About what? 'No I was saying..' that girl Rama is quite good looking. Yes good looking. - Quite jolly, friendly. Yes that.. is true. Then why is nobody getting the idea? - What idea? Even after knowing that you are still single.. ..Minudi is not making any arrangement. Oh. Oh.. No.. no she didn't think at all. And you? Don't you have any.. No, I too do not think about this. That means? That means there's no gain in thinking. I didn't understand. Actually, even if I wish, she doesn't. How surprising. Why doesn't she wish? Only she knows that. I'm thinking how foolish that girl is. Okay. So then shall I leave? - You'll leave? Yes, Mr. Ashesh. May I escort you? That won't be needed. The time got spent only in quarrelling. Did you feel very bad? So then you'll remember Aloka Chaudhary as a quarrelsome girl. I'll have to think over that. You'll go straight home I guess? I'll have to go to the wedding once. - You'll have to go? Why do you ask? - No, just like that. Perhaps we won't meet again. Perhaps we won't. Perhaps you may not get a chance to set foot on old garden street. I may not. What's the harm? You'll forget everything I guess? What's the use of remembering? That's true; what's the use? Wasting time by remembering an ordinary girl like Aloka Chaudhary.. ..you are not such a cheap man. All this shouldn't be said to anyone even jokingly. Jokingly? If people hear they may think otherwise. I don't care for people. What's this; the taxi went away? Yes it went I see. So then? So then what's the option? My car is there; come in my car. No.. no. Why? When I get down from your car at the.. ..wedding venue then what will you say to everyone? I understood. Then let's do one thing. Let the rain stop, then we'll take Ramlal's help again. Why would you trouble the poor one in vain? Rather let's go walking. - Walking? From Alipore to Dhakuria? Won't we find any taxi on the way? And what if we don't find? - Then, a rickshaw. And what if we don't find rickshaw either? Then we'll stand on the road side all night.. ..and keep quarrelling like this, okay? We're walking for half an hour and didn't find any taxi. You are really unlucky. - Unlucky? Who should be blamed, you or me? But make some arrangement; shall we walk all night? Wow! Just a while ago it seemed you are prepared.. ..to walk to the end of the world along with me. But really think about this; not seeing me there at the.. ..wedding venue, father must be worrying by now. Not worrying at all. - How do you know? Because I myself called him and.. ..said that his daughter had a headache and went home. Why did you lie in vain? Because I did not know any other way of making him worry less. But what could be the reason for not going there? I don't understand it at all. You didn't go there hence I got your rare company. Are you kidding? Tell me honestly, did you lose much by not going there? Then why were you so desperate to go there? Have to go somewhere; tell me where should I go? Wherever the heart wishes. If the heart says to go missing? Then? - Fine; that will be so. Taxi! Come. - What's this; where will we go? Wow! You just said you want to go missing. - But.. Well, only if you do not feel afraid of going with me. What are you thinking? Nothing. A few hours were spent in joy, right? Get some good sleep on going home. You'll see you don't remember anything; you'll forget it all. And what if I don't forget? - Certainly you will. One month, two months.. at the most a year. Then you'll see you've forgotten everything. You'll be busy with your studies. And I'll be busy with my doctor's job. Perhaps there would be no possibilities of meeting again in life. And moreover even if we meet there'll be nothing to fear then. Why? - What why? Then you'll have a big vermillion mark on your forehead. A huge veil on the face. With your husband as bodyguard. If I move ahead to talk to you he'll come charging at me. Have you ever seen Kolkata at night from the Ganges? Will you go, for a boat trip? Fine, don't go. But it will feel very good if you go. It looks very beautiful. If you say, I'll go. If I say then you'll go.. and if I don't say you won't? That has been happening since evening. I have been agreeing to your wishes. It will be the same this time as well. Wait I'll arrange for a boat. Will you take us aboard for a trip? Hey? - Of course, sir. How much will you charge? - Five rupees each, sir. No, not five; I'll give you four. 'You have not spoken at all for so long now.' No, is it? Shall I say whom you are thinking about? About Shaileshwar. How did you come to know.. ..if I'm thinking about something else or not? I read in a story; a man secretly loved.. ..a girl of rare beauty. The man didn't know that the girl has another lover. 'Both were deeply in love.' Then? Then.. Then one day the man stood in front of the girl with a bunch of flowers. The girl said not this flower. Then; which one? Blood rose. Then the man searched for blood rose in the market, in the fields.. ..in the cities, in the villages, in the valleys; didn't find it anywhere. 'Again he stood in front of the girl.' 'Blood rose doesn't grow anywhere in the world.' 'The girl got upset and said; so then you go away.' 'Your love is not love.' Then? Then what? The man went to the forest with his sorrow. And the girl forgot about him. This could not happen; the girl could not forget him anyway. Wow! That's in the story. The story is wrong. Fine; so then now I'll change the end of the story. The girl didn't forget the man, right? But you are not saying anything. Now you tell some story. I do not know any story. Okay then you sing a song. How did you have this notion that I can sing? No, I couldn't tell that exactly. But I felt you can. Perhaps by requesting without knowing I disturbed you a little. Don't mind anything. &quot;When it shattered, the illusion of union shattered.&quot; &quot;When it shattered, the illusion of union shattered.&quot; &quot;I had thought I won't ever forget the sight.&quot; &quot;When it shattered, the illusion of union shattered.&quot; &quot;Day after day in the soil of the path.. ..flowers fall down to become garlands.&quot; &quot;Day after day in the soil of the path.. ..flowers fall down to become garlands.&quot; &quot;I don't know when the time of coloring the world came.&quot; &quot;Got broken.&quot; &quot;Day after day when the pain of the heart increased.. ..I had thought my tears won't be shed anymore.. ..won't be shed anymore from my eyes.&quot; &quot;Day after day when the pain of the heart increased.&quot; &quot;I had thought my tears won't be shed anymore.. ..won't be shed anymore from my eyes.&quot; &quot;On suddenly meeting you on the way.. ..I could not stop crying then.&quot; &quot;On suddenly meeting you on the way I could not stop crying then.&quot; &quot;I was looking to forget.. ..the play of tears got broken.&quot; &quot;I was looking to forget!&quot; Aloka. Aloka. Why didn't you let me forget? It was.. ..it was much better if we had not met. Now let me go. Come. Father. Oh, what's this? You've not gone home yet? I came to take you. Come. - Oh yes that's right. Come.. come it's very late in the night. Come. 'What's this; you are leaving? - Yes, sir? Yes, sir. Look it's very late in the night. - Have sweets. No.. no.. no. I told you I won't eat anything. Aha, at least watch the wedding. The wedding.. - - Yes. Come.. come. Come, child.. come. You come. - Come. 'Move a little, move. Move a little, move.' Come.. come. 'Sanskrit chant' What's this? Shaileshwar? - Yes, Dr. Shaileshwar Ghosh. Gem of the university. 'Shaileshwar..what is Shaileshwar doing here?' 'Shaileshwar.. - What happened, gentleman?' 'Hey Mr. Biman?' 'Sanskrit chant' 'He had promised me.' 'No.. he..' 'Shaileshwar.. he said.. he'll marry Aloka..' 'He had promised. What are you saying?! Come, let's go. Come.. child.. come; let's go away. Come. 'I knew it beforehand..' 'Sanskrit chant' 'Sanskrit chant' 'Sanskrit chant' Hello? Ashesh, I'm going to that teacher's place right now! You also be present there! You don't know how disgustingly.. ..he and his daughter behaved here last night! They said Shaileshwar betrayed them! But Shaileshwar says he doesn't know them! If the teacher fails to prove his allegation.. ..then I will see how he lives in the locality! What's this? Shaileshwar, how come you're here? Well.. You told me that you didn't know them. Where is your father? Gone out. When he comes back tell him, that he should forgive me for.. ..the injustice I've done on you people in my ignorance. And.. the crime that Shaileshwar did.. ..I am sorry for that. Okay now I'll leave. Do you know? Last night, I just kept thinking about you. Early morning I got uncle's phone call. While coming all through the way I was thinking.. ..what I should do. Now I have decided. What have you decided? I'll have to take up the responsibility of this foolish.. ..daughter of the simpleton Mr. Teacher, for all my life. What, do you object? My agreement will be waiting for you. Enough, that's fine. Only your father is left, no point knowing him. Stay then. -Hey! Where are you going? Outside.. to get you tea. No?
