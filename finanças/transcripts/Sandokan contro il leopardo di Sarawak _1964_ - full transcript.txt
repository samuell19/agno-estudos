Sandokan, the mythical pirate known as the Malaysian tiger... He conquered all the areas that his father had lost. The huge adventures he lived with the Europeans and... His native friends are now a thing of the past. Sandokan reigned in Salavak and will get married... Sweet Samoa. I want to see it. Excellent, Sandokan. It was worth it to go back to Borneo to see again! You came for my weddings, not my achievements! Let's go back to the palace. Samoa is waiting for us! Hello, Samoa. A little one I do not know, came to see you. He said that Mochi is getting worse and wants to see you. I was told it was better. Now, it's worse. He keeps asking you. He stopped taking his herbs and medicines... I will come with you! I do not need an escort. I will be right back. One step, and your son is dying! Do not force me to shoot! I have no money. But I give you what I have to save him! I do not want either your life or that of your son. Do what I say and I will set you free! Why did you call me? What happened; Watch out, Samoa! Stay where you are. I'm sorry, princess, but you will come with me. How dare you; Sandokan will kill you! Let him kill Saravak the leopard. Not me. Come on, let's go! My child... Sandokan... My prince... Omar! What happened; Talk to me... The princess... Samoa... They took her... And my family, dead... Who did it; Strangers... Demons ... Find my son's killers... I'm afraid of Samoa. We will save her! The tiger you killed today is not so wild... As much as Saravak the leopard! Look, who came! Why do you hesitate? Kill me. You never fail... No, I want us to fight. From here... Here's someone who plays with weapons! Our old friend! Massunbata! He is our old friend. Take him to the palace! I thought that for the good of both of us, we would not be reunited. I was always hoping for a new meeting! I was strong before you came! Why exploit the poor! The people are not happy with your kingdom! They are enough to start an uprising. The leopard of Saravak! How about Charles Druck? It has English gold. English gold? I'm not surprised. I remember what happened in the past. But to hell with the English and Saravak the leopard! Where is Samoa? I do not know. Where is; Calm down, Sandokan, he's not going anywhere. Let me talk to him. He needs a persistent man. Hurry up. Samoa is in danger. They will not kill her. Leave this man to our Malaysians. They eat meat but do not drink water. He did not spoil your appetite... Here we hold our important prisoners. All my cooks were notified. You can eat as much as you want, but the water, you will save it! My cook is amazing but he has a bad flaw. He puts a lot of salt in the food. And that brings thirst, as you know. I will not speak. I will force you. These things take their time. You are brave. I admire you. I'm sorry you are not cooperating. What do you think; Will you change your mind? You will regret this. My men will bury you in the sun! Initially, you will cool down, from the wet soil. Silence, the heat will make the soil look like hell. The heat will burn you... And the thirst will make your mouth dry, so much so that... You will feel that your intestines are on fire. And then, you will talk about a drop of water. You will not resist anymore! Water... Please... Where is Samoa? Where is Samoa? One word, and you will have so much water that you can drown in it. No, Sandokan. If you want to live, speak! Where is Samoa? They kidnapped her... Who? The leopard of Saravak... Where did she go? In the caves... At the mountains... You will tell us where he is. Give him water and get him out of here! You are stupid! Massunbata would return. He had just destroyed Sandokan. Bring me Samoa. Good evening, cousin. For years, I no longer have the joy of seeing you. Come closer. Do not be afraid. Why are you afraid of your cousin? You got me from Sandokan, the man I love. Sandokan killed my father. Your father killed his whole family! It was a struggle for power. Was it necessary to kill innocent old men and women? We fought with the weapons that bring us victory. Kiss me, Samoa. I always remember the last time I saw you. I do not forget you... I wanted to marry you because I loved you. And I still love you. If the Malaysian tiger did not come between us... You would have married me. I never loved you. I will never marry you! No one else can make me happy! You will never see him again! Sir. Glad to see you again, princess. Your compliments are lost. The princess has forgotten her... old friends. He will think about it. And the day will come when... She will distinguish her enemies from her good friends. Put the woman in jail! If he escapes, you will pay for it with your life. Always arrogant and proud. I do not have an other choice. I will follow your advice. I was waiting for you, Prince Charles Druck. I spoke about your virtues, to the prince. Does the prince know why I travel all over the East? He wants to build a temple for his god. Do not be afraid. You will have as much gold as you want! But first make sure you do what I want! Come with me. I will prove it to you. Raise the railing. Do not be afraid. I am here. I hope you are convinced. Look at them. They will stay that way, as long as I want! You will do the same in Samoa. Her will will not resist, mine. And why not hypnotize me too? You will have us all on hand! I have no power over a man of your own free will. Women are different. Lower the railing! Thanks. And I was thirsty. There. Leave her. Well done, cousin! If I wanted to have fun I had to see how... You managed to escape from your cell. Well done, I congratulate you. Get him out of here. I feel sorry for him and those who still deceive and follow you... On the downhill you lead them. After you. Do not be so kind. My men follow me because they know I want to... Any sacrifice to destroy the Malaysian tiger. You believe that; Then you do not know Sandokan. Because you will see... If you want... Samoa, will you help your cousin regain his throne? He answered, Samoa. Answer! Commanding you! Yes I will do. And whatever else you ask me. Be sure of her. Samoa will obey you. May the gods protect you! I trust you with Saravak's defense. I want to come with you. No, Saravak must not be left defenseless! See you soon, my friend. We will be back soon and winners. If I were Saravak the leopard I would not feel safe with the two of you. My friends, let's get started! How many? 30 Malaysians. Sandokan and the Englishman. They are worth as much as an Army. Where are they; At the river banks. We do not have enough army to deal with them. You have not seen them fight. Otherwise you would not talk like that. Only with intelligence can you defeat them. Massunbata sent them. He was injured. I thought Sandokan would execute him, in front of the people. He must be judged in front of the people, if we capture him alive. How will we do it? Do you know the passage? I'm one of the few who knows. Sandokan will be careful. Take your brother with you. Sandokan will talk to him. He is an elder and a leader of your tribe. You are tired; I obey your orders. This man I hate, this tyrant... He is my enemy and the enemy of my homeland. And who is the true leader of Sarawak? My cousin Charles. He is in hypnosis. She will do whatever you ask her. Under my orders it can stay that way, until my death. Don't you hate me? You are my master. You order, I obey. This is not the love I want from you. You are my master. You order, I obey. Write! Take the pen. Writing. Sandokan... Sandokan, I'm a prisoner... The leopard of Saravak. Help me. Follow the one who brings the message. Keep me alive, the hope of seeing you again. Is it the graphic of the character? Yes, I recognize him. What's your name; Kouron. Are you from Ekimbaro? The Charles area? My father is your faithful citizen, prince! I was waiting for an opportunity to show you my faith. When Samoa was captured, I felt compelled to help. How is it; Do not be afraid. They do not treat her badly. She cries for you... Where to go? From Pantanos. He did not return alive, who took that path. He will lead you. Calm down. I know the path! They are coming. They reach our trap! Wait for them to reach the right distance. Aid! Get them out of here! He is of no use. Jackals need fresh meat. Captain Young! Any news? None! We searched the banks of the river. And the slopes? Nothing. He did not have to go alone. Maybe the Malaysian tiger fell into a trap. To double the Guard. To change men every two hours. The tiger of Malaysia! It does not look like a tiger at the moment. I openly fought my enemies, I never fooled them. You are here because you could not defeat your enemy. They say you never give up. Even when there is no hope. But you never lost anything. But you will lose the kingdom you stole from my father. And you will lose the love of the woman who is now mine. And he loves only me. She made sure we trapped you. Bring Samoa. You are lying. You would torture her. Samoa even hates your name. See and you will be convinced! My love... Who wrote the letter in Sandokan? The one we arrested him with? I. I wrote it. And it's not just that, Sandokan. Tell him why you wrote it. Speak, it can not hurt you. Because I'm sorry for what I did. I helped Sandokan, the enemy of my people. And I agreed to marry a man I do not love. It's not true. You love me, Samoa. The man I love and have always loved is... He! My cousin... If so, kill me. That would be very easy. Your execution will take place in front of the people of Sarawak. Let the world see your carcass. Take him, from here! In prison. Watch him. Remember, it's the Malaysian tiger. Should I retire? Indeed? How will my life be with her? He was left without a will. Will it always be so? Patience. When Sandokan dies, and you have taken the throne... She will accept her destiny. Calm down. You can choose how I will love you. If you want that, of course... What is this noise? The drums announce that the tiger of Malaysia... It is in our hands. The news will pass to the villagers. And you will have an enthusiastic army by your side. The sound of the drums will pass from city to city! Did you come to betray me, once again? You saved my life. I am not ignorant. Follow me! Let's go. No, if I do not see Samoa. It is dangerous... Where is it? From there... What do you want; Let's go while there is still time. I will not come with you, Sandokan. I can not. I do not want... What do you mean; I hate you. I have to hate you. Because you have to; You can not hate me! Come with me. My future no longer belongs to you. I will be back. Quick, Sandokan! Our guard was killed from outside. There is a traitor among us. Let him escape! You from there! He fell into our trap. No one came out of this cave alive. Sandokan... Be careful! Our fight with Sandokan is over. He arranged his men. He is invincible. We should have killed him immediately! The snakes will arrange it. The Malaysian tiger knows from snakes. Everyone knows we arrested him. What will people say if they find out he escaped? We should do something! Even if it survives, it will take time to get organized. The last time I saw you, you spoke to me like a snake. I should kill you. I deserve it, because I betrayed you! Leave, before I forget that your brother fought for me. Take his knife. It will help you remember that real men die! I know what happened in Ekimoro. And that you were a friend to my brother. What I am telling you is true. Now, do you believe me? Speak. They leave the mountain. All of them. Together with Samoa. Is it over 100? Then a direct attack will be impossible. We will follow them. We will wait for the right moment to attack them. After all, we want to save Samoa. Gather the men! Let's go! Prince, let me go back to my tribe. I will gather the men! I will tell them that you are alive and preparing an attack. I will be back in a few days. If you tell the truth, you will be rewarded. Your friendship and trust are enough for me! Take me to Samoa. No talking, if you want to live. Get the logs! Quickly. You may not need it. If Sandokan liberates Samoa, we will not attack! We must attack the Prince. I would like to slaughter him for what he did to my brother. You will do whatever I say. Did you understand; Come on! Quickly! Wake her up from hypnosis! What if I order her to kill you? Do it quickly, wake her up. Just use the sword and your death will wake her up! Okay! Samoa! Sandokan! Let's go! Catch Samoa! Give me a gun! Ready? Fire! The ammunition! Keep them! Tell the men to go from there! He would not come alone. Listen! It is as if an entire army is approaching. We are not waiting any longer, for a signal! Let us attack! In a few minutes, my men will have approached Druk! We will hit them from 3 sides! Go ahead, Tigers! Long live Sandokan! Go ahead, Tigers! Charles Druck! The leopard still has sharp teeth! And the tiger is still proud. But not for long yet, Sandokan. You believe that; Now, however, I am not tied! Druck, stop! It is moving sand! Come back! Charles Druck and his associates paid with their lives... Their horrible crimes. Now, your turn, Massounbata. The law must be imposed! It's your right, Malaysian tiger. The right of the strongest! Princess Samoa asks me for a strange wedding gift. He asks me to celebrate the day, with an act of mercy. I'm glad for you, but it's not right to let him go. As long as we have friends like you, we have nothing to fear. The people learned the great news. Listen, Sandokan! Your Tigers greet you! GYPSY == GYPT end
