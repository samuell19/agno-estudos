Free Press Bulletin Evening News! Fiery debate in Legislature... ...over divorce. Legislature debates Divorce Bill... ...over divorce. Legislature debates Divorce Bill. Give me my money. - I had given the money. The Divorce Bill is going to be passed. What's it? The law on divorce is about to be instituted. Then go and rejoice! All the time women's lib, man's excesses... Do you girls know anything else? - Don't scream. There's a meeting on. To hell with your meeting! Am I scared? God knows what's come over this house. All the time, meetings, lectures! All of them have become British. Last month I led a deputation in favour of the Divorce Bill. You know how important this bill is for our independence, our self-respect. Our society.. - Madam! In a man's society, woman is taught to be happy slaving for her husband. I hear cream is great for facial skin. - I think orange peel is more effective. Hear. Men have tormented us. Times were when a man would marry four. The poor women could only tolerate. That slavery still plagues our mindset. Just rub fresh orange peel on your cheeks. Mudpack is better. Wear it at night, watch your skin glow the day after. The Divorce Bill is imperative to stop this injustice. It's about to be passed! - How come you know? Look. Why didn't you say so before? Well done, Ramesh! Well done, Ramesh! Great form! Go for straight sets! Don't let him get a single I'll try. - Trying won't be enough. You must win! - All right. You know how I got here? - With the tickets, right? Aunt wouldn't let me come. I escaped through a window. Only for you. I see. Where's Anita? - Must be seeing Ramesh. Seeing Ramesh, again? - Who says? She's in her room, asleep. She's lying, madam. - Go on, take a look. No, she's unwell. Let her rest. Damn you 15/30. My shoes... those shoes are mine. Shoes, please. The other one too. Hurt on the nose? Staring at what? Look, there's a lovely match going on out there. Wonderful! Excellent, Ramesh! Saw that? Know him... who he is? You don't know him? That's Ramesh! India's number one Anita. The bloody secretary! Run! Bye-bye Ramesh. Hey Mister. First pay up your last week's dues. Then you can place orders. Stop sniffing that handkerchief. Out with the money, don't waste my time. Great. Great. For 3 days, I've been looking for you. My legs are tired, and here he sits... peacefully. You handle the cash register. Why haven't you been coming home? Where have you been? Cash register I've spent 6.10 on cabs, 9.14 on bus fares looking for you. Had you been at home, I would've spent at most a tenner. Now look at what I've lost! That's a lady's! Whose...? The cat got your tongue? "What magic holds my heart spellbound." "My pulse..." "it set my pulse racing." "My eyes have met someone's." "And I'm not the same anymore." "What magic holds my heart spellbound" "it set my pulse racing." "My eyes have met someone's." "And I'm not the same anymore." "Don't even ask me how I was yesterday." "My eyes were seeking, seeking, my heart was wishing, wishing." "Don't even ask me how I was yesterday." "My eyes were seeking, seeking, my heart was wishing, wishing." "Then I saw her, my wish came true." "Darling, my luck is changed forever." "What magic holds my heart spellbound." "My pulse is racing." "My eyes have met someone's..." "and I'm not the same anymore." "What strange addiction, this ecstasy of love." "She is mine, yet she knows not." "What strange addiction, this ecstasy of love." "She is mine, yet she knows not." "Oh cruel love, what plot is this?" "Oh darling, my luck is changed forever." "The magic spell on my heart..." "has set my pulse racing." "My eyes have met someone's..." "and I'm not the same anymore." "I can still hear her footsteps" "I'm still glamour-struck when I think of her." "I can still hear her footsteps" "I'm still glamour-struck when I think of her." "Has the day dawned? Is the night over?" "Oh darling, my luck is changed forever." "The magic spell on my heart..." "has set my pulse racing." "My eyes have met someone's..." "and I'm not the same anymore." "The magic spell on my heart..." "has set my pulse racing." "My eyes have met someone's..." "and I'm not the same anymore." What happened? - Is he unconscious? He's still alive, I guess? - Check his pulse. - Give him water. You were sick, weren't you? And you went out? Where...? Nowhere in particular. - To the doctor, maybe? Yes, I've been to the doctor. - What did the doctor say? He advises an outdoors life to stay fit. Watching tennis matches to stay fit too? I didn't go to watch any tennis match! She did. - Aren't you ashamed to lie? She's lying. You may leave Mona. Go on. There's a lot of difference between you and a common man. Getting mad about men doesn't befit you. But women are rarely fooled, they always fool the men Anita, tomorrow you complete 20. What I tell you is for your own good. I was married. I tell you, men are opportunists. You better believe me. All of them...? - You are a child no more. Tomorrow, your will inherit your father's millions. Thousands of young men will want to marry you, for the money. Fall for them, and you are deceived. Understand? The machinery inside is working? - Perfectly! This is just a sham... to stall me. He hasn't paid the rent and food bills for the last 3 months. But no more sympathies for him. - And no more picking his brains. Oh dear, calm down. - You shut up. Is he on his way out? What says your tubes? A few questions to clarify his state. - Go on. Is he a baccalaureate? - Graduated first class. He's a cartoonist too? - First class too. He possesses a single pair of woollen trousers? And his shoes wear out every two months? Once every month-and-a-half. Remaining fortnight, he makes do with cardboard, poor chap. He buys cigarettes on credit? - There you are! Cheapest brand. But you've said nothing about the disease...? It's one of the two diseases that's plaguing the 20th century. One's cancer and there's another. Cancer kills in 6 months. But a protracted illness of the other syndrome drives the patient... into a well or a deep lake. - What disease is that? Hunger and unemployment. Thank God, I'm employed! But doctor, what's the cure? Not medicine. Two square meals a day. - Two square meals...? If you get rid of one of your servants this poor chap might land a meal a day. You want to get rid of me? Out with my fees. Pay him. You pay. We'll settle accounts later. - God knows when. Look away. Look away. Here. I hope that wasn't two currency notes? You heard what the doctor said about two square meals a day, Mummy? Don't Mummy me! I have no sons! - I wish you had one. He'd be grown up now. - He'd be older than you are. And when he was a baby, he would've played in your lap. And you'd sing him a lullaby, and today, he'd be all grown-up... just like Pritam. Would you let him go hungry? Not at all! - Would you let him die like this? Why are you talking like this? - Then give him something to eat. Poor fellow is hungry. - I'm going. Help, please. Excuse me. - Go help her! That takes care of 15 days at least. After 15 days, we'll chat up Daddy. You're great. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday, my darling. Happy birthday to you. They have turned English! - Thank you, Aunt. Many happy returns of the day, Anita. Mr. Lawyer, no point wasting time. Let's read my brother's will. Sure. On this day, 10th of September, 1945. I.. Mohan Chand Verma.. Cut it out. Come to the point How much has my brother left Anita? How much he has endowed? In all, about 7 million 7 million...? - Yes. It's 7 million! You needn't marry someone for support. When will the trust bequeath the estate in Anita's favour? After her wedding. After the wedding! After the wedding? Yes, she must marry if she is to inherit the estate. When must I marry? Right away? Impossible! You must be wrong. Wrong? What are you saying? It's right here, in clear words. "Provided that if Anita fails to get married..." "within a month after her 21st birthday..." "the entire estates shall pass to an orphanage." When he dictated that... my brother must've been of unsound mind. - Must've been of unsound mind. You shut up! Then I too must've been of unsound mind because I was right there. He has also left a letter addressed to you. Read it, things will be clear. What did he write? - Read on. "My dear sister..." "I know what esteem you hold men in." "Therefore I fear, that once I'm gone and till time that you depart..." "you will keep Anita a spinster." "Which is why I am wording my will in this fashion." "Your loving brother, Mohan" Anita, if you see the joke in that, why not go to your room and laugh? Loving brother! My sibling turns out to be my enemy. May I read out the entire text? - No need to read that damned text. There's more spice to it, madam. - You may leave. If you say so, should I look for a suitable boy? There's little time I said, you may leave. - Certainly. Listen... there's a month left, no? - Yes. Hello. Johnny. - Hello. How are you, Johnny? - Hello. Good morning, Johnny. - Good morning! Hello, Johnny. - Excuse me! Hello. Hello. Johnny. - Excuse me please. Hello. - Hello. Okay! - Hello, Johnny. - Hello. How about an introduction? - How about doing it yourself? Thank you! Some thing. Please wait. The boss is busy. Front, first class. Profile, super class. If I were to say you're the prettiest in town, what would you have to say? I'd complain to the editor. - No show, if it's my job on the line. Would you still insist, if I offered you a lollipop? No... - Then here you are Johnny. - Yes, boss? Ramesh is leaving for England tomorrow. Go over to the club. Take some photos. Okay, boss. Don't you worry. I'll be right back. - Johnny, be back by lunch I haven't cash. - Understood. Hold your ground. And venture no farther on pain of hunger. "Like black clouds carried by the cool breeze..." "the maiden's heart sways ; there's love in her heart." "Like black clouds carried by the cool breeze..." "the maiden's heart sways ; there's love in her heart." "I waited till I heard my heart." "I waited till I heard my heart." "When I heard my heart, I couldn't wait" "I was swayed." "But my heart says, o'sway some more." "The maiden heart swings, I'm waiting for love." "Like black clouds carried by the cool breeze..." "the maiden's heart sways; there's love in her heart." "When I looked at myself, I was embarrassed." "When I looked at myself, I was embarrassed." "What was it on my mind that made me break into a smile?" "My tresses took a trot back after they kissed my lips." "The maiden heart swings, I'm waiting for love." "Like black clouds carried by the cool breeze..." "the maiden's heart sways; there's love in her heart." "A music tugs at my heartstrings." "A music tugs at my heartstrings." "I follow my dark eyes." "Oh, will it rain?" "Will the black clouds rain today?" "My maiden heart is waiting for love." "Like black clouds carried by the cool breeze..." "the maiden's heart sways; there's love in her heart." "Like black clouds carried by the cool breeze..." "the maiden's heart sways; there's love in her heart." Ramesh. Ramesh I'm talking to you! I have news for you. What...? - My Daddy has left me 7 million. That happened 9 years ago. - You never listen to the whole thing. And you always interrupt me. To get hold of the money, I must marry someone or the other in a month's time. Do that right away. - How about tomorrow? With who... me? - Yes. So when do we pick up our licence? - Anita, we've just been friends. When did you get into marry-mode? - When I heard of the inheritance. But I've never propositioned you. - Then do it now. Look, I've no time for a marriage. Tomorrow I'm off to England... playing at the Wimbledon. - Marry me, take me along. Ramesh, call for you, from some newspaper. I forgot! I have an appointment for a photo session today. Appointment? Shoot it! First fix the date for the wedding. Don't talk rot, Anita. I told you, I haven't the time. Listen... we're going to the movie this evening. I'll have your ticket sent over. Let's talk it over in the cinema. That's an interesting cartoon. Mr. Sharma, you always find my cartoons interesting. How about evincing an interest in offering me a job? As you know Pritam, my cartoonist has been working with me for 6 years. To put you on the job, I'll have to sack him. That's asking for too much. But if there ever arises the opportunity, I'll surely... Give me the job I've heard that several times. But of late... I've been in a delicate situation, concerning bread and butter. Why didn't you tell me you need money? Take it from me. I forgot my wallet at home. Excuse me. Hello. Speaking. Ms. Sita! You sound elated! Is the Divorce Bill getting passed? My efforts have borne fruit. You better be wary of your wives. Mr.Sharma, you're well-connected, aren't you? Will you do something for me? - Sure, what can I do for you? I'm looking for a boy, a gentleman. Better if he's educated. Strange! I thought you never employ men. It's a bit delicate. So he should be trustworthy and a man of his word I see... excuse me. Pritam, here's a job if you're willing. - Is it for the asking? Sure. Not a cartoonist's job, something else. - Whatever it is, just say yes. I have someone who fits your bill. When do I send him over? Right away? Let me give you Ms. Sita's address. So when will you be back from the Wimbledon? After a month? 3 or 4 months at least. I'll take a tour of Europe French Riviera, Rome, Paris Paris! Say that again. You could help me! Got that? Say 10 or 15. - But you've had so many. All robbed by my friends, and who spares a dish? Baby sends you cinema tickets. - Thanks. You may leave. Which baby? - He knows. What's this mess? Who's this baby? - Not baby. Big girl. Irritates me to the point of asking me to marry her right away. Then do it. - I don't want to get married. Then spurn her. - I've refused her a hundred times. But she refuses to listen. She's a die-hard fan. There's one way out. - What? Give up tennis. - Stop joking I'll put an end to this squabble once and for all. Johnny... want to see a movie? - Only for free. This one is. Here's the ticket. - Give that to me. Watch the movie and do me a favour. - What? She will be sitting beside you. Give her a letter. Write it out. Have you called a man? - Yes. He's here. - Show him in. Hey mister, come in. Sit. You may leave, nanny. Mr. Sharma has sent you? - Yes. What's your name? - Pritam. Are you educated? - Baccalaureate in arts. Yet you don't know it's bad etiquette wearing hats and raincoats indoors. Let it be. - Why...? How do I tell you this...? - What is the matter? My trousers are in a delicate way... - Never mind. You are a bachelor? - Yes, thank God. And employed too, thank God? - Yes. Excellent! Sit. Forgive me, I do not comprehend your appreciation of my poverty. You will. Unemployment is tough, isn't it? You have expenses... rents, bills to foot, food bills, the tailor's bills... No tailor's bill. The laundry bill. So how much do you spend a month? - Say 200, or 250 I can solve all your problems if you do something for me. Do what? - Marry. You have to marry. May I have a glass of water? No cause for anxiety. You will have to stay married for only a few months. You will file for divorce when the time comes. Divorce? Whom? You...? Don't be silly. I'm talking about my niece's wedding. - Ms. Sita, do you think I'm for hire? Be it you or your niece, I'm not willing to sell myself. Am I to marry this one? - Yes. Then I'm marrying. - But there are 3 conditions. Number one, after the wedding, you won't see Anita ever again. Nor shall you try to see her. - Then what need for a marriage? My needs, I know better. Condition Two... no one gets an inkling of the wedding. Last and most important... you must file for divorce as and when we want. Do you swear to abide? - Yes. Come what may...? - Yes. You won't mind if I sit here? - No. You won't mind if I pick up the bill? You won't mind, will you? No problem, eat! Have you tried Kashmir apples, the red ones? Aren't those dimples on the apples lovely? Yes. But I'll bet that your dimple is lovelier, with a smile. Maybe. - Then smile. A bit more. Hungry? Are you hungry? Keep this money. Have a treat. Let's eat together. - Together...? Must you spoil my party? Go to the next cafe. The next cafe? But I owe them 4 bucks. Four...? What a nuisance. Give me the money. Keep five, and get lost. - Why not here? Why are you after my life? Wait, I have something nice for you. Here, a ticket to the cinema. You'll find a girl next to you. Give her this letter. From Ramesh. Then take her out to lunch tomorrow. Provided you can. Now it's up to you. The show is at 2:45. 2:45 I said. Move it. This is movie time. Lanogamlin reporting. Excuse me, Ramesh sends you this note. Listen, he's passing a note to me. - How dare you make a pass at my wife? Forgive me, my mistake. - Bloody mistake. I'll fix you at the interval. In London, the initialing of memorandum of understanding.. ...carried out.. - I'm so sorry. I hope I'm not too late. When you walk in, you can't make out a thing in the darkness. Why are you shying away? Cozy up. What about the wedding? Listen, he's elbowing at me. Elbowing! You won't lay off, will you? Move over. Why did you elbow her? Why don't you answer me? Okay, I'm not getting angry. Once we're married, you won't go elbowing others, will you? You...? - Yes. How come you're here? - I'm carrying a letter from Ramesh. What happened? - Did he pass you a note? Hello, Johnny. - Hello. Hello, Johnny. - Hello. Hello, Johnny. - Hello. Hello! Here you are. Four. - Four? For me? If I could get hold of a porter, I would've bought out a shopful. If you throw those away, I'm going to complain to the editor I won't! Let's talk outside, please. - Let's go out right now. Not now, later. Go on, now. I love.. Love.. You. I'm taking this to the editor right away. My mistake. I'll erase it for you. I might erase what's written on that. But how do you erase what's written... on my heart? Not even laundry soap can wash it away. I'm tired of working and working! Meetings, lectures, all the time. Is this a hotel? British, all of them! Get up and eat breakfast. - I'm not eating all that. Then what will you eat? - Poison. Don't you ever say that again. Come on, get up. Sit. You've never been in love, nanny! That's why you're forcing me. In our times, we'd make love after a hearty meal, never hungry. Eat. I'm not hungry. - Not hungry? Why? Ramesh, that son of a gun... has refused to marry me. - Just as well. I hated the sight of him. You'll find someone far better. But who will play better tennis? - Tennis is the man? What will you marry? The man or the game? Eat, you're out of your mind. Not going out for lunch? Then it must be in here! - What? What I'm looking for. - What are you looking for? What I've lost. - What's lost? What I'm looking for. What are you looking for? - What I've lost. What have you lost? - What I'm looking for. What are you looking for? - What I've lost. What have you lost? "God knows where my heart's gone." "It was right here, right now... where's it gone?" "Fell for someone." "Ran scared of eyeballs." "God knows where my heart's gone." "It was right here, right now... where's it gone?" "Fell for someone." "Ran scared of eyeballs." "Has the fear made it run like a rat?" "I've looked into every corner, no wonder it's nowhere." "Why did you bring that here in the first place?" "Look fast! It's nearly evening." "Why did you bring that here in the first place?" "Look fast! It's nearly evening." "God knows where my heart's gone." "It was right here, right now... where's it gone?" "Fell for someone." "Ran scared of eyeballs." "Just one loving look..." "Just one loving look..." "just name your price, for my heart" "just name your price, for my heart." "You don't bump in, rob and walk away." "Come on, I'll have you jailed for theft." "You don't bump in, rob and walk away." "Come on, I'll have you jailed for theft." "God knows where my heart's gone." "It was right here, right now... where's it gone?" "Fell for someone." "Ran scared of eyeballs." "Just tell the truth, and no airs." "Just tell the truth, and no airs." "Are you the one who flicked mine?" "Are you the one who flicked mine?" "This is between eyes, understand eyespeak?" "Fall at my feet, then I'll tell you." "This is between eyes, understand eyespeak?" "Fall at my feet, then I'll tell you." "God knows where my heart's gone." "It was right here, right now... where's it gone?" "Fell for someone." "Ran scared of eyeballs." "God knows where my heart's gone." "It was right here, right now... where's it gone?" "Fell for someone." "Ran scared of eyeballs." Who is that? Pritam stays here? - No. His luggage stays here. She means, yes, he stays here, but he keeps outdoors mostly. Please come in. What's that please-come-in? - You don't know how to talk. Shut up. Do you want something to do with him? - No I just wanted to see... how he lives. - Are you a relative? Is that Pritam's room? - Yes. I keep nice lodgings. Tea at six, breakfast at eight, with porridge-toast-butter-and-tea. Will you please repeat that? Have you any complaints against Pritam? - Oh no, he's a decent boy. Who's concerned with decency? I want my rent. 3 months. Oh, dear! - What dear! How long has he been unemployed? - Ever since he came here. No. Add two more months to that. - Hear him, all praise for himself. Had you asked me that other question, you would've got a clearer picture. No problem. I'll ask you the rest. May I come in? Consider this your home. How can you live in such confined spaces? By now I'm habituated. Maybe you say that because you haven't seen a better life. Maybe you say that because you haven't seen the life... of the millions who live on pavements. I'm far better off than them. Are you a communist? - No, I'm a cartoonist. I have brought some papers for you to sign. The wedding notification. You arrive on the nick of time! Go on, you'll see her downstairs. Who...? - She just came asking for you. Don't waste time, you'll miss her. - Some girl...? Yes. - Let me wash my face first. By then you will have lost her. - But who is it? Julie. - But I was with her all along. What?! - Yes. Then go and look up Rosie. - Just say you want to be left alone. Is there anybody in there? - Yes. Who...? Who's in there? - Two ladies. They're coming out. Be there at 10 on the 20th. Be there. Going on the 20th? You'll be needing money, right? Just ask me, I won't give you a cent. Try pawning your trousers. Why are you sticking like a gadfly? - I never know, you might eat poison. Use the umbrella. It's sunny. - Get lost. With a sunburn, no one will marry you. - I don't want to. You go, get married. Good Lord. You...? Are you crying? - Not at all, am I? Just a cold. - Must be a bad one. Maybe I should tell you. Yes, I was crying. Why? - Ramesh, that son of a gun deserted me. Ramesh, the same one...? - The tennis-wallah. The one whose note you delivered. Damn him. Of course. Listen, I'll tell you something. Come down here. Oh no, how can I tell you? - Why not? You're a man too. - Not my fault, though. You don't know these men! Scoundrels, all of them. Really? - Yes. Have you ever been in love? - Of late, I've been... a victim of this disease too. - Don't catch that virus! I say, stay away from that virus! It's a dreadful affliction! What happens? - You're force-fed but you aren't hungry. Doesn't bother me too much. Over here, the starvation is stark. Not even bread. No bread? Why not eat biscuits? - Why didn't it ever cross my mind? You're smart. - Am I...? You aren't a bad sort. What's your name? What kind of a name is that? - Roll it over, you'll get to like it. Try saying it. "Face to face..." "don't hold your heart back, pretty girl." "Face to face..." "don't hold your heart back, pretty girl." "Just feel the cool breeze." "And feel your heart on fire." "Just feel the cool breeze." "And feel your heart on fire." "Why are you going away?" "Look, your beloved is coming for you." "Face to face..." "don't hold your heart back, pretty girl." "Pretty girl, you're hiding a smile." "You are overcome with passion." "Pretty girl, you're hiding a smile." "You are overcome with passion." "Those dark eyes that caress her lover shy away from us." "Face to face..." "don't hold your heart back, pretty girl." "Whenever their eyes meet, it sets her heart pounding..." "Whenever their eyes meet, it sets her heart pounding..." "ere the world gets to know, ere someone gets to know..." "Oh God forbid." "Face to face..." "don't hold your heart back, pretty girl." "Face to face..." "don't hold your heart back, pretty girl." I have found a way to save the legacy. - Even I've been trying to save it. But my scheme has failed. - Not my scheme. I've found a boy... willing to marry you and once you inherit, willing to divorce you. Will I marry someone who's thinking of divorcing me before we're married? Am I so unlovable? - Where's the question of love? We're paying him 250 a month. He's marrying for the money. This is a worse insult! He'll marry me for 250...? I won't marry him! - Don't be silly, Anita. Why are you bothered about how he regards you? It'll be enough if you manage to inherit. As you please! Johnny. - What is it?! What's the hurry? - I'm late for a meeting with Juliet. Johnny, what do I owe you? - I know, you need money. You aren't getting it. - What's 65...? Add another 10... and we have 75, round. - Add another 25 to make a hundred. I'm getting late. - I only have to sell 2 cartoons... and I'll pay you back. - By then I'll be broke. What a hassle! Look away. Away. Take this. It's nine! Will you iron my pantaloons while I take a bath? Where's the soap? How did the soap disappear from the bathroom? Pritam... gone? Pritam. He has disappeared too! My suit has disappeared too! What a hassle! And how many days before the other suit comes back from the laundry? Today's the 20th 20th...! He has gone to meet the old hag. What brings you here? Same as you. - I'm here with my aunt. She's talking to the registrar. You're here to see the registrar too? No, I saw you and I walked in. Listen, if I let you in on a secret, will you leak it? Not at all. I'm getting married today. - I see. Aren't you surprised? - I'm amazed. Whom are you marrying? - A mercenary. I haven't even seen his face, nor do I want to! Then why are you marrying him? - Aunt says that I must marry... someone or the other to save the inheritance. How did I miss it? I should've married you. Me...? You like me? - Yes... somewhat. What if this other man is as nice as I am? Can't be! He's marrying me for money! - Maybe he's in love with you...? Nothing like that! I haven't even seen him. Maybe he has seen you...? - Why are you taking sides with him? I don't like him one bit! Lady, you have been asked to come in. Wait here while I get married. I'll be over in a trice I'm coming with you. - No! Aunt will get angry I'm marrying on the sly. It's past eleven! There are 10 more weddings to be registered. Where's the bride? - Here. Sit. Read this. Go away. Where's the bridegroom? - Let me take a look. Here's the bridegroom. You...? Aunt! Is he the one? Greedy! Cheat! Selfish! How could you be all that? Listen... Anita... I'm not going to marry him! - How else will you save the money? You promised! Why are you concerned? He'll give a divorce whenever we want. Read this. Come. Are you being forced into this marriage? No. Have you read it? Then say, I Pritam Kumar accept you Anita Verma as my wife. I Pritam Kumar accept you Anita Verma as my wife. Now you say... - I Anita Verma accept... you Pritam Kumar as my husband. Where do I sign? First you sign. Now you. Let the witnesses sign. Congratulations. I said, congratulations. Here's your cheque for 250. You'll keep receiving cheques monthly. Don't try to meet Anita again. Did you want to see me, Mr Sharma? - Yes, sit. So how is your new boss? - New boss...? Yes, Ms Sita. - Should be fine I haven't seen her in weeks. - Have you been fired? No, the job entails getting paid for staying away for her. Would you like to have the job here? As what? - Cartoonist. Really? - Yes. When do I join? - Tomorrow. I hope you aren't joking? - Not at all. Still combing? What's this? Lipstick! Hurry up, we're getting late. - Don't you get worked up. Or I'm not going. - Okay, I'll show you my teeth. Come on. You want money? It's in my drawer. - Let me have the keys. Here you are. - Johnny, let's take Pritam along? Till you've eaten mincemeat, you won't know why bone in mince is a spoilsport. Join us. What's it? - Forget it, man. Go on. Let me have a cigarette. Where have you been so long? Come, meet my friends. My friend from school, Ms Anita. This is Johnny. Mr Pritam Kumar. So what are you doing nowadays? - Doing a job. Haven't we met before, Miss Anita? - Maybe... but not at some dance party. You should know that it's a must to be dressed formally at balls. Sorry. Sit down. She's gone. Where did you meet her? - Don't remember. You don't? Strange! I'd never forget where I met a damsel like that. Let's dance. Take care. They don't give me credit here. I got to talk to you. - I got nothing to talk to you. What kind of a joke is this? What will people say...? They'll say, what an insolent wife! Doesn't want to talk to her husband I'm not your wife! - Forgotten so soon? You haven't forgotten about the marriage certificate, have you? Shall we talk now? I should be leaving. Why have you started hating me? - You expect me to love you? Sold yourself for 600 bucks! - You've got me wrong. I'm not greedy. Then why did you marry me? - I couldn't refuse you. Lie! I like you Anita. No matter how much you flatter me, you aren't getting a pay hike. Not a cent more. "Sky blue eyes." "Sky blue eyes." "Someone moistens my eyes." "Someone moistens my eyes."

Had work to catch up with. - This cartoon idea is great. This woman looks familiar. Who is it...? More heart than head? I mean, it isn't wishful thinking, is it? That blue-eyed girl at the club was super-class! Is she married...? How do I know? - You don't know? How long will the chameleon hide? Every Tom, Dick and Harry wants my advice in such affairs. And you? You made no mention of it. Where's the matchbox? Whoever finds out, will curse me, not you. Because I'm experienced. What will I say? 4 cheques? 250 each? Signed by Ms Sita! Johnny, put it back. - You pay me back my 75. It isn't meant for encashing. - Meant for wearing around your neck? What do you mean? - How long will the chameleon hide? I heard everything at the club. You were there? - No, I sent my ear after you. Just do as I say. If you can convince her that the wedding... was a matter of the heart, not money, she might. Great! Here I am wracking my brains, and you're pushing a pencil! Forget it Johnny, it's pointless. Let me work I'll forget all but my 75. Make sure you pay me soon. You're making headlines. - Are they praising me? No, it's a cartoon about you and Anita. Look. You get back to work. Which scoundrel did this? - It's Mr Sharma's paper I can't believe this! Let me find out. Forget it. You drew this cartoon? Yes. That's Anita and myself? - Yes. Do we look like that? - Yes. You make fun of us? You know the outcome? Yes. - Having anything more to do with you... is disgraceful! I want a divorce! - Divorce? But as far as I recall... I married Anita. - I hate insolence! You promised... you'd give a divorce whenever I want! - Does my dearest wife agree too? She isn't your wife! - If she isn't my wife... why ask me for a divorce? Besides, you're forgetting. It's the court that decrees the divorce. Not I. There can be several arguments for convincing the courts. Like... - Like, you've been ill-treating Anita. Perfect. But first give me a chance to ill-treat her. The you will have grounds for divorce. - What do you mean? Won't the courts ask how I misbehaved with her... ...if I haven't lived with her for a single day? You and Anita should live together? Before the divorce? You mean that? Can't do it after divorce, can we? Otherwise you won't give divorce? - Not on your terms. You're unworthy of dignified discourse My lawyer will speak to you in court. Is your lawyer indignant? Is this relative holding a convocation of degrees here? Bestowed me with one. What is the matter? - I refused to divorce her niece. You refused? Great! But what do you do now? Can't figure out, still thinking... - It's right here, in my head. Come along... this is tried and tested. Come on. - Where to...? Just come along. Got it? Wait here. Let me find out. What a shine! Is someone riding out? - The young lady. Mr Chauffeur... one minute. Not a strand out of place! Lovely moustache! Never saw whiskers like that. Are you a Rajput...? How come you know...? - Oh I know everything. I'm an expert. Will you do me a favour? - Yes go on. You really will? - Just ask. Let me take a photo of yours, along with moustache. But the lady is travelling... - Your moustache is more valuable. But... - Please try to understand... Just come along. To the club. Now which angle to I take it from...? I want to go to the club! Where are you going? To your in-laws. I am, yours truly. How did you get here? - By dint of your chauffeur's whiskers. Stop, right now. - No. Are you taking me perforce? I'll jump out of the running car! - Jump. What happened? What if I break a leg? - I settle for a lame wife. She won't run from me. Idiot, where were you? I was at the gate. I saw him taking the car away. How was he to look at? I couldn't take a good look. - Anita was supposed to take the car. She might've seen. - Yes, she must've seen. Where is Anita? Call her. - Can't do that. He rode off with her. What...? - Yes, he drove off with her. Idiot! Why didn't you tell me before? Are you saying something? - I'm cursing you. Of love, or hatred? What happened? I asked you what happened! - Your car is no less than you are. What? - And just as well. What will happen now? - Husband and wife... can spend the night together in the car, comfortably. My foot! I'm not staying in a forest. - Would you prefer some place else? Fix the car. - Let's give it a push. I won't! - Then drive it. I can't drive! - Looks like we're here for the night. "There she goes, leaving my heart aflutter."

"Will you go away leaving my heart aflutter?" Disembark. I won't. You won't get off? - I won't. What insolence is this? Put me down. That's what I'm doing. She has twisted her leg, you see. Have you got married on the sly? Listen to that! She asks me whether I got married to you on the sly. What...? I hope you aren't in pain. Do you need medicine? No, I'll be all right. What's your name? - Anita. The way he carried you, I thought... Oh no! So you're still to marry? - She'll stay a spinster... for another 20 years. She has millions stashed away at home. What more happiness for a woman than making a family of her own. You don't know, sister-in-law! Unless they have much to gain... these city-girls don't marry. - Don't mind him. He's always babbling. Take some rest. I'll make lunch for you. Take her to the room upstairs. Lady, move it. Pick me up. I've sprained my ankle. - Are you out of your mind? All the way up 30 steps? - Why not 300? I've sprained an ankle. Keep sitting. I can't do it. - You can't...? Sister-in-law! Uncle... Put me down. Down, I say. Why are you carrying her? Who is she? She's a fairy. You must handle her delicately. Is she a fairy? - Yes. Where are her wings? She has her wings hidden, spreads them only when she flies. Can we see her wings? - Don't you touch the fairy. She'll fly away. Keep an eye on the fairy. Don't let her fly away. Come here. She talks. Come here. Why? - You might fly away. I won't fly away. Your uncle is a liar. Touch me, see if I have wings. Come on... Look, do I have wings? I have no wings, right? Sonu! Aren't you going to school? I'm not going to school, there's a fairy here. The fairy is staying on for a few days. Talk to her later. So you've brought home a fairy! I hope she doesn't cast a spell on you. She has surely cast a spell on you. You're right. I like the girl. Get married, fast. Forget it! Who likes me? I'm going to die a bachelor. Why won't she like you? Is my brother-in-law any the lesser? You don't know them. They're very rich. So what? If she has money, you have the heart. If you say so, I'll talk to her. - Forget it, she isn't my stuff. When is my brother coming home? - He's away on a tour. Call Anita down for lunch. Come. What are you grinding? - The wheat. Let me do it for you. No my princess. Not for you. You'll get blisters. Let it be. I'll learn if I work. All right, you supply the wheat. But I'll grind it. Why do you work so much? - Who else will do my chores for me? Happiness with my family is also about the household chores. Doesn't this hard work take a toll on your health? I've been married these four years. No toll showing yet. Only four years? - Yes. Three children in four years? - How naive of you. I meant to say, having babies one after the other isn't good for you. And it costs you your independence. - What independence? What mother would want freedom from her children? Can I ask you something? - Sure. Does your husband beat you once in a while? But he loves me too, doesn't he? Once in a while, when you chew your food... you might find a stone in it. But you don't give up eating, do you? Get married first. Then you'll know what love is. "You are pretty and my heart is young." "This is a tale of many colourful nights." "You are pretty and my heart is young." "This is a tale of many colourful nights." "What poetry is this? What is this tale...?" "Oh, where have I lost my heart? Oh, what poetry is this?" "The Spring has come into my home, it's amazing, yet I await her." "The Spring has come into my home, it's amazing, yet I await her." "Is love punishing me?" "Is love punishing me?" "Or is the night pining?" "This is the season of youth." "You are pretty and my heart is young." "This is a tale of many colourful nights." "What poetry is this? What is this tale...?" "Oh, where have I lost my heart? Oh, what poetry is this?" "The stars are burning." "Loneliness is love's curse." "The stars are burning." "Loneliness is love's curse." "The fragrance in her tresses..." "The fragrance in her tresses..." "makes my heart pound." "My eyes speak the language of my heart." "You are pretty and my heart is young." "This is a tale of many colourful nights." "What poetry is this? What is this tale...?" "Oh, where have I lost my heart? Oh, what poetry is this?" "I wish I had someone who would take to heart my love" "I wish I had someone who would take to heart my love." "Dreams of you fill my nights." "Dreams of you fill my nights." "In the shade of your eyes, my rests." "My lips speak your words." "You are pretty and my heart is young." "This is a tale of many colourful nights." "What poetry is this? What is this tale...?" "Oh, where have I lost my heart? Oh, what poetry is this?" Oh touch me not! You'll wake me up I've tied the fairy's wings, she can't fly anymore. It can be untied. Not the bonds of love. You...? Welcome. Come inside. Where is Anita? - She's right here. And she's very happy. - What you've done isn't surprising. Thank you. I must commend your intelligence. Maybe you think this was chivalrous? But we civilised folk call this brutish. Which means I have no right to my wife? I see. Among civilised folks, is the husband the wife's slave? I know your intent. The lure of the lucre will entice any pauper. Wonderful! Shall I make a note of this? How much for getting out of my way? - Not to inconvenience yourself. Thanks to your good wishes, I can provide for my needs. Then you wouldn't have sold yourself for 250 a month. Keep this cheque. For 10,000. In exchange, set my niece free. A question for you. What price, the freedom of my wife from your tyranny? Cast a stone in muck, the filth rises at you. I do not wish to speak to you. Excuse me, Anita isn't leaving against her wishes. This is her wish. Read this wire. You sent this wire? I ask you, did you send the wire? Then why did this farce with me? - You're getting me wrong. I should've known. No trusting butterflies like you. You've no right to insult me! I'm not your slave. Oh no! You are an Empress! What use talking to you? Go on. They say love lasts lifetimes. Before taking the decision... ask yourself. Where's Johnny? - Pritam! You're back? A week's programme over in two days? How did it go? Forget it, come here. Can I get hold of a bottle of booze? - Hush! If someone hears... we're going to jail! - Johnny! You told me you don't drink. There! Now you field her. - Didn't you tell me you don't drink? It's true! Who's drinking? - Why were you talking of booze? Just talking about it! My mistake! - You're lying! You deceived me! No! - Yes! No! - I say, you deceived me! I say, I didn't! - Don't you ever try to see me again. Gone. I'm always losing because of you! Lost my money, lost my suit... now my girl's gone too! Why did you say you want a bottle of booze? I just want an empty bottle. - Empty bottle? Why didn't you say... "I want an empty bottle of booze" You say empty, after she's gone? Next you'll say you want a girl! - I do. How many? - Two. Two...? The fan... the fan. What has come over you? Why do you want a photo like this? What's your problem? Just snap it. How am I concerned! Here. Oh! You forgot the bottle. Put it there. That cost 12 cents. Not for free. The label towards the camera. Won't you come please! You too. Why don't you take a cure for grey hair? Your whole head is grey. You take the cure, dear. - Do I...? Did you hear something? - I've been hearing you for 25 years. Just go on talking. - Not I! I heard a girl's voice... coming out of Johnny's room. - Must be your voice... echoing back from the neighbourhood. - You've become dumb, man. Your head isn't working anymore. You blame me for voices? Let me take a look for myself. I'm dead! - Don't open. Say you're working. Go on. If I don't open up, it'll be broken down. Put out the light. Shaking up the whole building in the middle of the night? Won't you let anyone work? - Why is it dark inside? Can this be done with lights on? - I'm sure there's someone inside. Who...? - Two dozen rats. 50 dozen bedbugs. Go away, don't bug me. Papa! It's past 11:30. Go to bed. I saved my life. But someday, you'll get me thrown out on the streets. Now get over with the photos and send them away. Come on, please try to understand. You...? How can you walk in like this? No! If you're going to behave like a goon, I'll call the police. Watchman... Not to be afraid. You still have many more years to live to redeem womankind. By what right do you scale my walls and come in through the window? Had you taught your commissionaire how to behave with your niece's husband... I wouldn't have had to enter like this. - Why have you come here? For your benefit. Keep this. Why are you giving me this dirty photo? To help you prove in court that I am characterless, wayward... unfit to be your niece's husband. On the basis of this photo... and court will rule a divorce. - You really want to divorce her? I can't believe this! You forced her... - I didn't force her. It was up to her. Anita will be very pleased to see this photo. I have more to incur your pleasure. Here are all your cheques. If money is esteem, keep it. It'll add to your prestige. Was your aunt born in England? A marriage isn't purposeless. If you've taken a man's hand, you stand by him all your life. I'm ready and I'm willing, only if he's willing. You never gave him a chance! Have you ever spoken sweetly to him? When I wanted to, he threw me out! - After all, he's a man. How long can he stay mum? Are you an empress? You are his wife. I'm his wife... Then why doesn't he come to woo me? - As if that's the only thing to do. You go on, you woo him. How do I woo him? - Just go to him. You'll get to know. Don't you try to instigate Anita. You are a maid, don't you forget. Get out. You have much faith in Pritam, no? - Yes, as I should. I will certainly see him. - Then you will be deceived. He's an old hand at taking advantage of girls. You are getting him wrong! He loves only me. That's what he must've told you. But this photo says something else. Where did you find the photo? - From the girl he deceived... before he deceived you. - I won't accept it! It's untrue. He isn't like that. - What do you know, what he's like? How long have you known him? If not me, trust your eyes. If he isn't like this, how did this transpire from? If you want to jump into a well, knowing fully well, you're welcome. Who am I to stop you? Nothing's still undone. You can get a divorce on the basis of this photo. "My world was being plundered, and I stood speechless." "My world was being plundered, and I stood speechless." "My heart was being torn to pieces..." "but who cared?" "My world was being plundered, and I stood speechless." "My world was being plundered, and I stood speechless." "Not a tear in my eyes..."

"but who cared?" "My world was being plundered, and I stood speechless." "It's true..." "no, not a tale..." "It's true..." "no, not a tale..." "of the lunatic..." "who was plundered." "This soil lay hushed, the sky was silent." "This soil lay hushed, the sky was silent." "My heart was being torn to pieces..." "but who cared?" "My world was being plundered, and I stood speechless."

"My heart was being torn to pieces..." "but who cared?" "My world was being plundered, and I stood speechless." "My world was being plundered, and I stood speechless." "My world was being plundered, and I stood speechless." My Lord, before I go into the charges of misbehaviour... alleged against Pritam Kumar, by the plaintiff Anita Pritam... I would like to delve into their lives preceding the marriage. Before the marriage, Ms Anita Verma was the sole heir to a fortune... the scion of a cultured family. The accused was a jobless wastrel. When a rich, naive girl steps into the life of a wastrel... he finds in her a wonderful opportunity to put an end to his penury. An innocent girl starts believing in the false promises of love... faked by a clever girl. And Ms Anita Verma begins... to take a liking to Pritam Kumar. - Not to worry Anita I've got the best lawyer in town. He'll make sure you get a divorce. On October 25, 1954, they married. That very day, Mrs Anita Pritam Kumar... was jolted for the first time in her life. That very day... Pritam Kumar deceived his wife. But it wasn't enough to stem... a wife's love. In her concern for her husband's penury, she sent him... cheques for 250 Rupees every month. And the rogue that the husband was... he squandered his wife's money in his deviant pursuits. This is a small example of his debauchery. So that's why you wanted that photo! I'm not going into the witness box. Stop raving at him. Is Anita Pritam Kumar here? Your name? Anita Pritam Kumar. You will swear to speak the truth and nothing but the truth I shall speak the truth and nothing but the truth. Did you know Pritam Kumar before your wedding? Yes. - How come? We met a few times. - Where did you meet? In the park, in cinema halls. During these meetings, were the two of you alone? There was no one else? - Taking advantage of seclusion... which of the two of you proposed first? Please answer me. Your reply is necessary. Who proposed first? The same man who wooed you till the marriage... deserted you the very day you married him? Is that true? - Yes. True too, that after deserting you, he lived with other women...? What do you know about his lifestyle? Have you seen this photo before? That's all my lord. Madam, it's going to be my turn. - I told you not to talk to me here. If you aren't talking to me now, I'm not talking when I'm in the dock. I want it right now. Is Lily D'silva present? Yes, sir. Excuse me! Your name? - The court clerk screamed for me. You didn't hear the name? Order! Order! Answer the question. Say, what is your name? Lily D'silva. You shall swear to speak the truth and nothing but the truth I shall speak the truth and nothing but the truth. Hi! How are you? Mrs D'silva, do you know that man? - What a silly question, man. How can I not know a man who has been living in my guest house for 10 months? This is a court. Please mind your manners. What happened at 11 pm on the 2nd of last month? I was sewing. My husband was sitting beside me. I was telling him... about his greying hair. But you're balding... Forget what you said. What did you hear? What did you see? That's what I'm saying. I heard girls' voices from Pritam's room. But my husband said, it was I... - Then what did you do? I knocked on his door. Then what happened? - I'm telling you... Johnny opened the door and said... - When was the door opened? How long after you knocked? - After a full five minutes. What did you see inside the room? - I only saw Johnny. It was dark. He shut the door quickly. There were girls in there. How do you know there were girls inside? - How would you know? I heard noises from inside. Then I broke down the door. And what do I see? There was Pritam, sitting with two girls. One on each side. That's all, my lord. You forgot to ask the real thing! He also had such a big bottle. A bottle of booze. Order! Order! Thank you, you may go. Is Pritam Kumar present? Have you appointed a lawyer? Have you anything to say about the accusations against you? I would like to ask the accused a few questions. Is it true that you were unemployed before your marriage? Yes, unfortunately. - How were you living? Off my friend. - You are one of those in society... who won't take the trouble of making a living for themselves? Instead, you hunt for preys? - No. I'm one of those... who don't prey on others for money. Instead, I think it better... to ask a friend to help. - At the time of your marriage... you were looking for an avenue for making a living? Yes, and I found it in this marriage. This is a court. Stand upright. Do not digress. Ask your questions. - You agree that you married for money? It's all lies! Why doesn't he say? - Then you go and tell the truth. After your marriage, have you been wayward? What do the vanguards of society, men of your ilk, consider to be wayward? This is being wayward. - No, this is a photo. The girls in this photo with you, are honourable ladies? Yes. None of the girls are any less honourable than the women here. He's abusing us. Do you call women who sell themselves for a few Rupees, honourable? If those who defame others for the sake of a few millions are honourable... why not these girls? - How much of your wife's money... have you squandered on such honourable women? Answer me! How much of your wife's money have you squandered? The court is adjourned till tomorrow. There's Anita. Congratulations. I'm a reporter from Modern Times. A few questions. You can ask me what you want. Whose fault led to this divorce? Anita? - What are you saying? Pritam is the guilty one. - This is a question of woman's honour. This divorce must be granted! - Yes. Long live Women's Lib! - Long live! Long live Ms Sita! - Long live! In the train, I met a liar worse than I am! He was saying... his wife will spend half a buck, if it takes one. I said mine spends a quarter. He's shaken, asks me how? I ask him, you say how. He says, she buys a fan worth a buck, and she tears it into two. For 6 months, she uses one half, the next six, she uses the other. I say, my wife makes do with it for two years, and he asks how? She holds the fan in front of her head and she sways her head. You didn't laugh? - Matches? What an insult! Why matches, ask for my life, I'll lay it down for you I've taken more than enough of advantage of you. Not any more Johnny, how much do I owe you? Seventy five, no? - We'll see that later. Keep it. Might not get another chance. - Why...? I'm leaving for Delhi tomorrow. - Tomorrow...? Yes. "Come to me, my love..." "My love-lorn heart calls you. Come to me, my love." "Come to me, my love..." "Come to me, my love..." "My love-lorn heart calls you. Come to me, my love." "Come to me, my love..." When will you return? - To Bombay? Why return to the city of merchants from the city of the kings? This is what I don't understand about you. Agreed, you don't tie someone... into a marriage against her wishes. But why did you give them that photo? Why bring yourself to disgrace? - You got to have the heart. If I'm out to please someone, why not pull out all the stops? Whatever you say, I'm not convinced that this is making Anita happy. When she looked at you in the court, there was such pain in her eyes. "Come to me, my love..." "Come to me, my love..." There she is. - Did you see the papers today? Yes, Ms Sita's niece after all! - Yes, they must be celebrating. Is Anita here? - Over there. Good evening. - Good evening. If you've forgotten my name, I can remind you. I remember. - You also recall, I'm Pritam's friend? You are here to talk about Pritam? - Who cares talking about Pritam? To hell with Pritam! I'm talking about the weather. Isn't the weather lovely? Yes. - This is the season... that reminds you about your partner...? Look, look at that. What do you see? - Fireflies. Why do they shine? - I don't know. You don't know? That's Mrs Firefly signalling to Mr Firefly. But it's different with us. The missus is running from the mister. Why not? Mr Firefly doesn't ditch Mrs Firefly for other fireflies. Correct. They trust each other. Unlike us they don't... start mistrusting over trivia. - You call that photo trivial? Says which fool? It was a sacrifice, just to make the divorce easier. Aunt said a girl gave her the photo. - Your aunt wear spectacles... yet she can't see. Pritam gave her the photo. He also returned the cheques. Also the cheques? - Yes. How do you know? - Who else would know? I took the photo myself. If you don't trust me, I can show you the negatives. The lawyer was saying, you'll get the divorce tomorrow. You should be glad, Anita. You're going to be free. Are you glad? - Yes, indeed. Then I should be glad too. - What do you mean? All my life, I've been doing everything to make you glad. It's for your own good. - Pritam gave you cheques back. He gave you the photo himself! Hiding all that was for my own good? So you met Pritam? Not yet. I'm going now. Don't be insane, Anita! The matter is in the courts. The papers are writing about it! If you go back now... just imagine how disgraceful this is going to be for us! Your prestige! So what if it ruins someone else's life? Whatever you do... you are self-serving! The leadership is self-serving! Self-serving are... also the ideas you impose on others! - It's for the betterment if women. Experience has taught me everything! - Then take some more experience. Instead of holding forth on dias, go out among the masses you despise. Go to their homes, and see how women cherish their homes in India. Those stupid women think slavery is happiness. What do they know... what freedom is? I shall teach them the meaning of freedom. Freedom as I have learnt from women in America and Europe. And they will give you more to learn, like changing husbands every season. Coming from a village girl, that could be understandable. How strange! An educated woman like you sings paeans in praise of slavery. If working your own household chores, if keeping your family happy... is slavery, then a thousand paeans I shall sing. If it is in slavery... that man and wife find love and appreciate each other... and care for each other's happiness, then it is a far cry better... than this liberation which is no more than hatred of men. You want to see me happy don't you? If this is the way I am happy... then why are you sad? - Sad will be the day... when you come to me crying after you are discarded. But by then... all will have been ruined! - Not to worry. I will never knock upon your door. - I do not wish to argue with you. You aren't leaving. Try stopping me. - You will pursue your will? Absolutely. Do it. Aunt! Aunt! Aunt! When is the flight to Delhi? - One at 8:30, one at 9:00. May I have the ticket please? Faster Johnny! He's gone! - Where? To the airport. He's going to Delhi. - Hurry up. Move it. Faster. Push it. - Step on the accelerator. Faster, my man. How long before the flight leaves? - Very little time! Push it, man. Has the plane to Delhi left? - About to leave. We must meet a passenger. - Not now. Can you put me on the flight? - Sorry, too late. "Come to me, my love..." "Come to me, my love..." "Come to me, my love." "Under the tree, on a rain-drenced night..." "we played hide and seek together." "Under the tree, on a rain-drenced night..." "we played hide and seek together." "Remember, my love..." "the love-song you sang for me. So come to me." "Come to me, my love." "Come to me, my love." "Come to me, my love." "Come to me, my love." "Come to me, my love" - Pritam! What has come over you? - You were supposed to be gone. Not that one. My flight is after half an hour. I'm not letting you go. Who are you to leave me? Come to your senses. What will people say? What a bad husband! He's deserting his wife. Husband...? The divorce...? Over. Come on, hurry. We're here too. Where are you going? To the court. - Shall we go too? To court? - What fool goes to court? Oh, I am sorry! We're going elsewhere. Excuse us, this is private. The registrar or the church? - Church. Turn that side! Registrar. - Church. Registrar. - Church I say, to the registrar! No, to the church... In this duel... ...yours is gone! Mine too!
