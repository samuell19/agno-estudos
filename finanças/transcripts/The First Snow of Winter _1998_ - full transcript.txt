[birds chirping] WHOA! LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT BIRD. HA, HA! HE'S NOT AS TOUGH AS HE LOOKS. AND NEITHER ARE THEY. [squawking] COME ON, PUFFY, LET'S SCARE THOSE GULLS. OH, DO WE HAVE TO, SEAN? THEY'RE NOT DOIN' US ANY HARM. PUFFY, GULLS ARE JUST STUPID. THEY DESERVE TO BE SCARED. THEY HAVE FEELINGS, JUST LIKE US. WELL, THE ONLY FEELING THEY'RE GONNA FEEL RIGHT NOW IS PANIC! BLAH! YEAH! I LOVE THIS! GET OUT OF HERE. GO ON! [Sean whooping] [laughing] HA! WORKS EVERY TIME! OH, SEAN, WHAT WOULD YOUR MA SAY? SEAN! SEAN! WHERE THE DEVIL IS THAT BOY? WE'LL BE LATE TO MIGRATE IF HE DOESN'T COME HOME SOON. AH, EASY ON THE LAD. HE'S JUST OUT HAVIN' FUN. FUN, IS IT? WELL, ISN'T HE HIS FATHER'S SON? SEAN'S A DUCK RUNNING AMUCK, AND YOU JUST SIT THERE BLOWING YOUR SILLY WHISTLE. SOMETIMES THE 2 OF YOU-- AH, KEEP YOUR BEAK ON NOW, MOTHER. HE'LL BE HOME SOON. ♪[playing flute] (both) WE'RE READY, MOTHER. OH, BLESS YOU, MY DEARS. I'M GLAD WE'RE NOT ALL FEATHERBRAINS IN THIS FAMILY. HEY, PUFFY, WILL YOU LOOK AT THIS? WOW! HEY, LET'S GO FOR A SLIDE! OH, MORE LIKE A FALL, SEAN. GO ON, IT'S NOT THAT STEEP! EXCEPT FOR CHICKENS. WELL, I THINK WE SHOULD GO HOME, SEAN. [clucking like a chicken] HEY, THEY MUST BE WONDERING WHERE WE ARE. FINE. YOU RUN BACK TO YOUR MUMMY, AND... [gulps] LEAVE THE HEROICS TO ME! [yelling] [laughing] AM I OR AM I NOT MAGNIFICENT? [stammering] HA, SPEECHLESS ARE YA? SEAN! AH! [gasping] [panting] [sighs] THAT WAS CLOSE! [both panting] I TOLD YOU. WE SHOULD HAVE GONE HOME. WHAT? AND MISSED ALL THAT ADVENTURE? HEY! DID YOU SEE THE LOOK ON THAT-- (mother) SEAN! [both screaming] SEAN SEAMUS ALOUICIOUS DERMOT DUCK. WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING? OH, HELLO, MA. ONLY PLAYIN'. AND HAVE WE FORGOTTEN WHAT DAY IT IS TODAY? ER, THURSDAY? UH, IT'S FLYING SOUTH FOR THE WINTER DAY, ISN'T IT MRS. DUCK? SO WHY AREN'T YOU AT HOME GETTING READY? BYE, SEAN. BYE, PUFFY. MA. YOU'LL SEE PUFFY AGAIN IN THE SPRING. COULDN'T WE JUST STAY HERE INSTEAD? NOT WITH WINTER COMING. IT'LL SOON BE TOO COLD. WE HAVE TO FIND SOMEWHERE WARMER. MA. YES? WILL THERE BE GULLS TO CHASE WHEN WE GET THERE? NOW PAY ATTENTION, EVERYONE. FROM NOW ON, WE MUST ALL STICK CLOSELY TOGETHER. AND THAT MEANS YOU TOO, SEAN. YES, MA. NOW, WHERE ON EARTH'S YOUR FATHER? (father) STAND ASIDE. EMERGENCY LANDIN'! GANGWAY! DUCK! [guffawing] "DUCK", DID YA GET IT? [chuckling] NICE LANDIN', DAD. UH, SORRY I'M LATE, GANG. I FORGOT ME WHISTLE. OH, AND WE WOULDN'T WANT THAT NOW, WOULD WE? LOOK! LOOK AT THE SKY! [birds chirping] OH, NO. WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT? IT'S STARTED. WE MUSTN'T BE LEFT BEHIND. ALL SET, EVERYONE? RUDDERS. WINGS. ALL CLEARED FOR TAKE-OFF. GO! OH, BOY. GULLS! [mimics plane engine] [chuckling] (Sean) COME BACK! COME AND PLAY! [gulls squawking] W-WHERE'S EVERYONE GONE? MA! MA, WHERE ARE YOU? CAN'T ANYONE HEAR ME? IS THAT YOU, MA? MA! IS THAT YOU? AHHH! SEAN! WHERE'S SEAN? WE'VE LOST SEAN. SEAN? HE MUST HAVE TAKEN A WRONG TURNING IN THE CLOUD COVER. NOW RELAX, MOTHER. HE'S JUST DRAGGIN' HIS WINGS A LITTLE. I'LL GO BACK AND LOOK FOR HIM. NO, NO, YOU STAY WITH THE LITTLE ONES. I'LL GO, AND WE'LL CATCH YOU UP. [coughing] PICK ON SOMEONE YOUR OWN SIZE. MA! COME BACK. DON'T LEAVE ME HERE. MA! [thunder rumbling] [grunting] (Voley) GOOD MORNING, DUCK! IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE YOUR FLIGHT HAS BEEN CANCELED. [chuckles] GO AWAY. GO AWAY? AND WE'VE ONLY JUST MET. NOW THEN, WHERE'S YOUR MANNERS? LOST 'EM. NOW LEAVE ME ALONE. I'M ALL RIGHT. AND I'M VOLEY. PLEASED TO MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE, MR. ALRIGHT. [guffaws] THE NAME IS SEAN. OUCH! AND YOU'RE NOT ALL RIGHT, ARE YOU? I--I THINK I'VE BROKEN MY WING. HMM, NOW THAT DOES PRESENT A BIT OF A DILEMMA. YOU SEE, A BROKEN WING MEANS NO FLYING. AND NO FLYING MEANS NO FLYING SOUTH FOR THE WINTER. AND NO FLYING SOUTH FOR THE WINTER MEANS-- WELL, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THAT MEANS FOR THE MOMENT. IF YOU CAN'T FLY ON YOUR OWN, WELL, PERHAPS YOU JUST NEED A LITTLE HELP. ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS? ABSOLUTELY, ABSOLUTELY. YOU ARE ONLY TALKING TO ONE OF IRELAND'S GREATEST PILOTS. I'VE NEVER HEARD OF A VOLE FLYING BEFORE. IT WAS IN ALL THE NEWSPAPERS. WE DON'T GET ALL THE NEWSPAPERS. [groans] OK. NOW, AFTER TAKE OFF, REMEMBER TO FLAP YOUR FEET AS HARD AS POSSIBLE, AND KEEP ON FLAPPING LIKE THE CLAPPERS TILL YOU SEE COCONUTS AND PALM TREES. NOW OFF YOU GO! HMM. WELL, I DO HAVE ANOTHER IDEA. NOW, THIS IS A LITTLE TRICK I LEARNT WHEN I WAS AN ASTRONAUT. SEE YOU NEXT SPRING! [Sean exclaims] [Voley laughs] [water splashing] COULDN'T I JUST STAY WITH YOU INSTEAD? SEAN! SEAN! SEAN! [gasps] OH, NO. SEAN. HOW COULD I LET THIS HAPPEN? IF I HADN'T LET YOU FALL BEHIND, YOU WOULDN'T BE... NOW, LISTEN. WHY THE LONG BEAK? WELL, WITH THIS LITTLE SPLINT HERE, YOUR WING SHOULD MEND IN NEXT TO NO TIME. I MISS MY MOTHER. WE ALL MISS OUR MOTHERS, BUT YOURS WILL BE BACK SOON ENOUGH. IN THE SPRING, I EXPECT. WILL SHE, VOLEY? OH, SURE. AS SURE AS GRASS IS MUSICAL. AW, GRASS IS JUST GRASS. ♪[playing] [laughing] AMAZIN', ISN'T IT? A SIMPLE BLADE OF GRASS AND YOU CAN SQUEEZE AN OLD TUNE OUT OF IT. OH, CAN I HAVE A GO? OF COURSE! JUST HOLD THE GRASS THERE, FILL YOUR CHEEKS AND BLOW. [sputtering] [chuckles] A LITTLE MORE BLOW, I THINK. ♪[playing tune] [Sean laughing] (Sean) THIS IS FUN! [sheep bleating] WHAT'S THAT, VOLEY? OH, NO. IT'S A SNOWFLAKE. AND WHERE THERE'S ONE, THERE'S USUALLY MORE TO FOLLOW. [chuckles] THEY TICKLE! HMM. THAT'S NOT ALL THEY DO. COME ON. (Sean) BUT WHY ARE YOU SO WORRIED ABOUT SNOWFLAKES? UH, THEY SEEM HARMLESS ENOUGH. SNOWFLAKES ARE HARMLESS. BUT SNOW IS ANOTHER THING ENTIRELY. WE'VE GOT TO FIND YOU A WARM HIDEY-HOLE BEFORE THEY BEGIN TO GANG UP ON US. THERE NOW. WHAT'D YA THINK? IT'S BROKEN. WELL, OF COURSE IT'S BROKEN. IF IT WAS WORKING, THERE'D BE A DANGER OF PEOPLE TAKING IT OUT TO SEA. OH, IT SMELLS OF SEAWEED. IT'S THE PERFECT VESSEL FOR A VOYAGE TO THE SPRING. [Voley grunting] ONCE WE'VE FIXED THAT, OF COURSE. WELL... STEP ABOARD, SON, AND SETTLE IN. IN THE MORNING, WE GO SHOPPING FOR SUPPLIES. [birds cawing] SQUIRRELS, SQUIRRELS! YOU'RE JUST A BUNCH OF RATS WITH PERMS! [Voley laughing] ARE THOSE YOUR TAILS OR IS SOMEONE PAYING YOU TO DUST THE BRANCHES? MISSED, HA. MISSED. CAN'T YOU DO BETTER THAN THAT? THANKS FOR THE DONATIONS, FELLAS. DUCKS DON'T EAT NUTS AND BERRIES. AS OF TODAY, YOU DO. [sheep bleating] [whooping] WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'? COLLECTING WOOL, SON, TO KEEP YOU WARM. DID I EVER TELL YOU ABOUT THE TIME I WAS A COWBOY? SOMETHING ON YOUR MIND, SEAN? I'VE BEEN THINKING. NOW, NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT. IN FACT, I'D ENCOURAGE IT. AM I A BAD DUCK? NO. AS FAR AS I CAN TELL YOU DO THE DUCK THING VERY WELL. THEN WHY DIDN'T MY PARENTS COME LOOKING FOR ME? PERHAPS THEY DIDN'T WANT ME ANYMORE. PERHAPS THEY JUST-- [shushing] [mumbling] SAVE THE TALKING BIT FOR LATER. [whispering] QUICK, UNDER HERE. [Sean gasps] OH, NO, NOT HIM. I GATHER YOU'VE MET BEFORE. [sniffing] [sneezes] [screaming] AND ANOTHER THING, IF YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT, THEN YOU ARE ALL JUST NUTS! [panting] THAT WAS BRILLIANT, VOLEY. WHICH REMINDS ME, DID I EVER TELL YOU ABOUT THE TIME I WAS PURSUED BY A VOLE-EATING TIGER? IT WAS LIKE THIS... (Voley) BEAK UP, SON. I MANAGED TO ACQUIRE A FEW MORE SNACKS FROM OUR SQUIRREL FRIENDS. [chuckling] THERE. THAT LITTLE LOT SHOULD KEEP YOU GOING ALL WINTER. NO, NO, HA. YOU MEAN KEEP US GOING? YOU. US. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE? YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LEAVE ME, ARE YOU? UH, NOW. ABOUT THAT. I'VE BEEN MEANING TO HAVE A WORD OR 3. THE THING IS, WELL, DUCKS IS DUCKS, AND VOLES ARE DIFFERENT. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO FLY SOUTH FOR THE WINTER, AND ME, I'M SUPPOSED TO SLEEP. [yawning] AS A MATTER OF FACT, IT'S WELL PAST MY BEDTIME ALREADY. I OUGHT TO BE HITTING THE HOLE. TAKE ME WITH YOU, VOLEY. I CAN SLEEP, TOO! NOT IN A BURROW IN THE GROUND. NO, NO, NO. AND NOT FOR 5 MONTHS. I'M SORRY. IT'S JUST NATURE'S WAY. BUT, VOLEY, I WON'T SURVIVE WITHOUT YOU. OF COURSE YOU WILL. YOU'VE GOT FOOD AND WARMTH. AND YOU'RE SEAN. SEANS ARE NATURAL SURVIVORS. I COULD SLEEP FOR AGES, IF YOU TOLD ME A VERY BORING BEDTIME STORY. YOU'D ONLY BE UP EVERY HOUR ASKING ME FOR A GLASS OF WATER. VOLEY! YOU... YOU TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF, OK? AND LOOK OUT FOR THE LAMBS. LAMBS MEAN SPRING, AND SPRING MEANS... [sighing] VOLEY! VOLEY! [wind howling] [creaking] [footsteps] (Sean) PUFFY? PUFFY. WAKE UP! SEAN, IS THAT YOU? OH, YOU'RE FROZEN STIFF. COME WITH ME. WE'VE GOT TO GET YOU WARM. WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? THERE WERE SO MANY BIRDS AND SO MUCH SEA, AND I LOST MY MOM AND DAD AND-- TAKE IT EASY, PUFFY. SURE, YOU'LL BE AS GOOD AS NEW IN NO TIME. I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU. THANKS, SEAN. AND WHEN YOU'RE WELL AGAIN, I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO PLAY MUSIC WITH JUST A BLADE OF GRASS. YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN SMART, SEAN. NO, I HAVEN'T, PUFFY. BUT I'M LEARNING. [bird chirping] [bird chirping] [yawning] [gasps] PUFFY! PUFFY? PUFFY! WAKE UP! COME AND SEE! [bleating] HELLO. PUFFY, DON'T YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS? LAMBS MEAN SPRING, AND SPRING MEANS... (Sean) WE MADE IT! (both) WE MADE IT! [both cheering] LOOK, BLOSSOM! AND BUMBLEBEES! (both) YEAH! [Sean chuckling] COME ON, PUFFY! I KNOW A GREAT PLACE TO WATCH OUR FAMILIES COMING HOME. [growls] [gasps] (Voley) LOOK OUT BELOW! VOLE PATROL TO THE RESCUE! [grunts] VOLEY! YOU CAME BACK! WELL, I NEEDED A SPOT OF EXERCISE AFTER SUCH A LONG SLEEP. [chuckles] BOYS, I THINK YOU'D BETTER MAKE YOURSELF SCARCE. RIGHT, RIGHT, COME ON. GIVE US YOUR BEST SHOT. BUT, VOLEY! GO. [Voley mumbling] VOLEY! RUN, SEAN. HE'S SPOTTED YOU! [water rushing] [gasps] [giggles] I CAN FLY! VOLEY? COME ON. WAKE UP, VOLEY. PLEASE WAKE UP. VOLEY, I--I DID IT. I CAN FLY AGAIN. I CAN FLY! YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN ME, VOLEY. I BEAT THE FOX. I FLEW! [bird chirping] VOLEY? DIDN'T I TELL YA, IF YA FLAPPED YOUR FEET HARD ENOUGH, ONE DAY YOU'D MAKE IT. [gasping] [chuckling] VOLEY, YOU'RE ALIVE! [mumbling] LOOK IN THE SKY, SEAN. THERE'S MY MA AND DAD! [birds chirping] AND THERE'S MINE! OH, I'M SORRY. I THOUGHT YOU WERE... HEY, GUYS. REMEMBER ME? I'M SEAN. [birds chirping] HAVE YOU SEEN MY PARENTS? HAS ANYONE SEEN MY PARENTS? THEY DIDN'T COME BACK. [sniffs] [ducks quacking] WHY ARE WE ALWAYS THE LAST TO LEAVE AND THE LAST TO RETURN? WE COULDN'T SET OFF WITHOUT MY WHISTLE! MA! DAD! IT'S ME! IT'S ME! MOLTING MARY, MOTHER OF DUCKS! IT CAN'T BE! IT'S SEAN! MA! SEAN. I THOUGHT THE FOX HAD GOT YOU. AH, DON'T YOU JUST LOVE A HAPPY ENDING? ISN'T HE HIS FATHER'S SON? YEAH. ♪[playing flute] HEY, VOLEY. WOULD YOU MIND VERY MUCH IF I DIDN'T STAY WITH YOU NEXT WINTER? OF COURSE NOT.
