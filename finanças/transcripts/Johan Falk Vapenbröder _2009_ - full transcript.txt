BROTHERS IN ARMS -They're on the roll. -Ok, thanks. Have a nice day! Don't cut yourself on the paper. I like to change, but the office needs someone who can read. -Will he get the last word? -Please be kind the weak. Hello, Egil! The cars are leaving now. -They'll be there in ten. -I'm ready. Ten minutes? No, sorry. Ten days of course. Send them as an economic package. Norwegians! -Here they come. -Ok, Egil. They're here now. -The stage is yours. -Ok. Ok, John, That was your tip. What do you see? Felix and Seth Rydell- -Frank Wagner, Martin Borhulth, Viktor Eriksen and Conny Lloyd. Damned fool ... Conny. Zoom the camera a bit closer, Spark. 23,000 per piece. -We could arrest them all. -But we won't. We won't take those thugs today. Yes? Turn up the volume. I want more sound. Well ... Mmm ... Take up the other one. -Magazine? -He's good. Where did you find him? There are services and favours. Patrick helped the Norwegians by playing the villain in a deal there last year. Wait a minute. We need to talk. Is there something to talk about? I don't sell by the piece any longer. -Take the whole lot or we won't do business. -What the hell is this? -We agreed on six. -And now I say 12. You buy 12 or we close the shop and go home. You choose. Are you kidding me, right? Is that a no, or? Zoom the camera a bit. Closer. Good. Yes, Egil, continue. -It doesn't break the contract! -That's nice of you. I'll give you first chance, but I want to sell them all. -It doesn't break the fucking contract! -Pipe down now, Fleksnes. Then you have to call a consumer advisor. It's all or nothing. It leaves me in the shit. -There's the money. I'll take the weapons. -Conny! Drop your bags. You got that? Drop your bags! What? Chill out, chill out! Ear piece! Easy, easy ... There is a new deal now. Take it! What should you do? All or none. Decide. It was hard to get money. I can't. You know that. -The customer has pulled out. -Good, old man. Then we prefer. Ok, what do we do now? We let them go. Nothing has changed. We'll let them walk. -You heard. Just pack up. -Ok. -Can I do something more? -No, hell. -I can't do more. -It's enough. Johan! Better handle office equipment next time. Depp doesn't have any Kalashnikovs. Clas Ohlson is looking for replicas. -Are you going with the train, Dick? -I don't have time today. -Welcome home. -Thank you! Give him time. He needs time to himself when he can. He probably knows more than you right now. Tell us. Someone rang Seth Rydell. Then, we didn't buy. -Do you think they learned? -What? That we were there? Then, the Norwegians would oblige us to have a new colleague now. I think Rydell had a better offer. Somebody who wanted to buy all 12. I've never seen anything like it. Cancelling an on-going deal! -We'd have bought the whole lot ourselves. -Absolutely. There, I agree. We'd have sudsidized the underworld with 25,000 kr directly from the Treasury. -Great! I love the Swedish people. -Do you want shops robbed using the weapons? We had to money. Cancelling the deal is better than having the other 6 scattered all over town -Are all 6 bound for one buyer. Or? Contact all your informants out there, to see what they can find out. Someone's not content with half a dozen AK-47s, but must have all 12. It is hardly an ordinary robbery. Linda, a double vodka and Sprite? Niki, you cover for me down there? Have a beer. Cheers! Come on. One more. Cheers, guys! -How do you think it went today? -Good. don't you? Good. But you know what I'm doing here? I meet people, I have the contacts ... People trust me. You know why? I stand by my word. People rely on my word. I prefer a casual buyer, who leaves with 140 salmon. What the hell do you think he is saying about me after you pissed on him? -You think you know everything, right? -Obviously not. You'll thank me when we're done with this. Try saying that to the little boys inside the jail. "little boys in prison" ... We'll go up there. Sitting here and talking is ridiculous. I don't know what you're doing. You're my boss, with all due respect. But I don't know what you're doing. I thought we'd make money; not make lots of new enemies. Hope you can damn well get paid by the new buyers, whoever they are. We must. You are so fucking angry all the time, Frank. What is that? Call it a "shopping list", if you want. Are you kidding me? -Shall we take this out? -Yes. There aren't any problems? -Hey, Frank! -Hello. Do you want some? -Ask Seth. Not here! -No ... Give me a shot then. -Do you have money! That's new? -Yes. -To me, too? -I'll pay. -Here's to you. -Let it be! Cheers to you, Frank. Cheers. -Your action today was good. -Keep the money. You stood up for us even though Seth blew our deal. -We back each other up, right? -That's not all. You helped me. You were in the hospital with my mom and ... I did this for you. I wouldn't do it for anybody else. Take a look. Did you see the list? -What is MGL? -Multi-Grenade Launcher. Some damn rocket launcher that fires three shells in seconds. -Who the hell is it? -Hell, I don't know. It isn't our job to find out. You're crazy to worry about that. He'll contact you when he can. What's he doing? -He saved our Norwegian today. -Yes. Egil said so. Egil said that? He exposes himself to a hell of a lot. Egil saw, and I don't know which of us in the nest ... Inevitably the group eventually begins to suspect ... ... What we have out there. What you have, I have, Sophie has. It's so. But everything stops here. All right. And what will the prosecutor do? What prosecutor? What? No, but wait a minute ... -What the hell are you saying? -What the hell do you think? -Do we now trust the prosecutor? -How else can we operate? We'll look like idiots if we call him before we have a suspect. -But, what the hell! We don't know if Seth Rydell will sell a dozen Kalashnikovs. -You have to think it through. -No one said we're running without a prosecutor! Who's the investigator? You? -If you can handle it better, let me know. -It is that Ok by you? -It's the job. -It isn't us who take the risk. No one requires something like this. He is a pro. We are professionals! He has a restaurant and you easily persuaded the poor fellow. Take an early evening, John. Go home. Have you got the apartment in order? How does it feel? Good. It'll be nice. Yes, more or less ... Have you got anything up on the walls? Ola's picture of the clown? Absolutely, it's in the hall now. I'm looking at it right now. Our project then? Did you talk further with the broker? No, hell! Forgive me. I haven't reached him. There's been so much crap. Or do you want me right there? What do you mean? Shouldn't we have a lot to say to each other When we haven't seen each other for so long? -What? Haven't we? -Do we have it? Do you find it? Yes, or course, we're talking now. I'm just having dinner. Ola makes me crazy. He must have something. All right. But ... What about him? Is he good? -Yes. -And Nina? They feel good. It's just too late. You know how he is. All right. -Give him a kiss. -Yes. I'll call tomorrow. -Good. -Hey! Hello! -Did you sleep? -Yes, indeed. -What is it? Tired? -It was a bit tough today. And now you want to go back to sleep, right? No, now you have brought me you may blame yourself! -Hey! Subject matter "Vnd"? -Upstairs, aisle three. Humour! I read what you wrote. It is perfectly Ok, and I understand if you jump to ... ... ago. Now we need you more than ever. -You have children, right? -Yes. -How many? -Two. One's from my wife's 1st marriage. How old? Five. A boy. When you hug him ... ... You didn't get a sense then ... I was there when your mother was buried. There was a girl with a pram some distance away. Is that her? That list, you e-mailed me ... -If it's true ... -It is. Broadly in all cases. I may have forgotten something. If it's true, is anyone ready to mobilize for a small war. Something is gonna happen and we must act. But we can't do it without your help. I say to them today I'd like to opt out. And you think it's Ok for them? My mother has just died. It isn't even a lie. Wouldn't I be where they don't want me. It's that simple. I've seen what they do. They'd kill their own for the smallest pretext. Imagine if they knew we were talking! Yes, but hasn't it been dangerous all the time? There is little difference now when you have nothing to lose. -Think about this. -I have done it. Think for a bit then. Howdy! It's Martin. I need help. What happened? I can't hear you. -I need help, Frank! -Where are you? With you. Shit! What the hell has happened? What the hell has happened? Stay awake now. Who did this? Martin, who? I don't know ... -What? -I don't know. Of course you know. Who wrote it? Tell us! Who? Who? -View ... -What did you say? Seth. -What do you? -We get nothing more from there. And I understand him. I'd have done the same thing. Despite this, you realize you can't reveal the source? We have no one else out there who knows anything. This is damn serious, John. -We have to take it upstairs. -To the Prosecutor? They're downstairs. I said "up". "Armour-piercing rocket grenades"? Yes, gun or maybe it's called grenade in Swedish. -Equipt for the war? -I don't know. Who preparing for war? We only know someone has ordered it. It's not good to have it in the attic. -You wanted something. -We are well clear. The priority now. Now we try to get as much information as we can. -Nothing that affects the rest of us? -Yes? Can I suggest something? If I took this strategic decision- I wouldn't act for a while, unless something new happens. Leave it a few days. There's enough for us. -What is it? -Welcome aboard. You begin to think like us. Come on! Was that a compliment? I will say this: your friend has had a tremendous turn. No internal bleeding, two cuts but no fractured ribs. -So he can handle himself? -He is stitched here and there. Moreover, he'll be on his feet in a few days. You know we have a notification requirement on this, huh? If I don't think he fell what do you do think? I can think of something if you want; but it just happened. He has been given pain killers and is sleeping now. Would you like to stay, we'll tell him when he wakes up. Thank you. Here, check out ... Good! Typically, you should do it also. Other line now. -What the hell are you? -Glad to hear you. You nearly beat him to death. You have a good reason. There in the harbour yesterday with the Norwegian ... don't ask me how, but the cops were there and knew everything. -How do you know? -Does it matter? The important thing is I know. We should be glad nothing happened to the dealer. How do ... You miss the point. We have a spy among us, so somebody squealed. one of us. Are you sure? -Martin? -It could be him. What do you mean by that? Turns out you almost killed one of our guys for something he's responsible for? Sorry the wrong person got the message. But I'm convinced that signal will reach the right person. -You are sick, Seth. -It comes from my hard childhood. Stuff is about to show up. You check everything works before we ship. don't do it. we'll get big problems. Do you understand what I'm saying? What they are angry at Dad! -What is the situation? -Good. The doctors think you're the worst geek. The world is in uproar, and you've received a small cut. Frank? I didn't shirk off. -I didn't shirk off. -I know. -Hey! -Hi. It's me. I just wanted ... What are you doing? I slept in the office, can I refresh myself. Will you be there on 15 November when he starts kindergarten? Mmm. Has something happened? No ... -It's just some stuff. -What? Nothing dangerous. I promise. But I'll sleep in town tonight just in case. You'll turn into the worst house father. Sometimes it would feel better if you got a little angry instead. There'll be an end to this. I promise. -Kiss. -Kiss. You say nothing unnecessarily, right? Are you surprised? You've always complained when I'm talking for a bit. You know what I mean. Locked doors, half-sentences ... Nobody knows what you're doing, and now you're there. You were the secret; not the job. No, but I'll do better. I continue to keep quiet about my personal life too. You ... -Yes? It's me. -Hey! -What is it? -Good. I'm still on the job, got to work over a bit. Can I call you then? I have a meeting. -Sure. -Good. Hugs. -It is Anja. -Hey! Are you gonna work all night or do you want a ride? Why did you come back? Europol. You could have sent you anywhere in the world. What? Would you have liked it? Huh? I don't know were it is; but if you want, I have tea. No take away sandwiches, but tea and ... Yes, tea. -Is it programmed to do so? -No, there is nothing like that. But ... we'll do it another time. Tea, that is. All right. Hey, wait ... That meeting with J?ger Power. Are you doing anything? -Do? -Do you have someone under surveillance? If you ask me that? Why I didn't even know what you were talking about. All right. Good. SOS 112 What's happened? I want to report an apartment brawl. -What is the address? -11 Victoria Street. -An ongoing assault? -Just now. -Are you nearby? -I live there. -Have you been out and checked? -No, I haven't dared go up. -She cries all the time. -Ok, we'll send the police. If he isn't a police officer, who the hell is he? Do they have reason to suspect you of anything? Apart from having a smoke with you? I've been so damn cautious. Seth knew you had surveillance at the harbour. -How the hell did he know it? -He thought Borhulth talked. No ... It was a signal. A signal? Well ... You ... You know what I'm going to say now, right? Don't let them think that they can scare you. I don't say it because I want to keep you. I will, of course, but that isn't why. It is so. The weapons are on route. Seth doesn't want to shirk off, but he needs me- To check all weapons and manage the whole thing. Where did you heard that ... ... I was in the Foreign Legion? -Just because you were there. -Not as long as people think. When I went down to Marseille, I almost got to the door. A crazy Frenchman strikes you on the head and screams ... They want to break you down physically and mentally- - and then build you up again. I didn't learn how to dispose of a fucking Multi Grenade Launcher. I googled a little yesterday. It's the type. All right. -Seth's little brother is here now. -Ok. Can you get these? Start with Gisson and then the other. There should be enough now. How nice! Then we can handle another month. -So this is a MGL? -don't! Put on gloves or something. What does your brother do? You'll just be a little boy. -We just talked about you. -Really? We have a prima donna who are too good to stand. -I'll have a cigarette. -I want to talk to you later. -Have you locked up? -I'm not stupid. -Are you running home to me or Seth -I'll take the car? Frank? -Quiet! It's red. -don't say that to me. So. Green! Pussy too! What the hell ... -Stay in the car. -Now I'm out there. It was just a small accident. -How long did you drive around like that? -What do you mean "drive around"? What the hell ...? -Did you see it was broken? -I didn't seen anything. I had no idea it was so, for real ... Jonas! The hands on the roof, both of you! The hands on the roof! What the hell ... Frank, the police want to talk to you. -Hi. -Hey! -Frank. -Patrick. -Nice to meet you. -Yes, unbelievable. -Did you ever unlock them? -Yes. Sorry. -Bend forward, young man. -Yes, sir. -Now it will stick to the bit. -Ok. So. -Hey! -Hey. -Hey, Hasse. -Welcome. We go to the room where we have classroom. -Yes. For a long time since last time. -Yes, a while ago. -What about the civilians? -Good. And yourself? -You have gone down. -It has made up for you! I wonder they don't me check out when the police bring a guy with ski mask? They think you are the police. Then we'll have coffee. Who wanted sugar? -Me. -Aloo. Then we'll have cognac. Welcome. I'll take the gun Before I tell what's interesting. It's Milk MGL MK-1, a hand-held rocket propelled grenades. Used as a support weapon. The magazine takes six shots, in three seconds when I shoot. And it revolves clockwise. It is also interesting to know it has a functioning spark plug- -Much like an ordinary revolver -When I push off. I remove the spark plug. The weapon doesn't work. Period. The spark plug is here- And that part is interesting. If I remove it, I can disable everything. -Where is it somewhere, then? -It sits on top. So there. Excuse me. I'll just take this. I do and go at me too. How long can we keep on like this before people start to wonder? When you refuse to cooperate with the police we can keep you 72 hours. By that time you should be an expert on that gun. Felix then? He sits in the interview room right now, just like you. I want to ask you about something. Check out my apartment. It is in the pipeline. Officially, the search for weapons, which of course we can't find. However ... I can promise you- if anybody monitoring you at any time, we'll discover it. You have nothing to lead to your girl? Good. By the way, Borhulth is Ok. He was discharged today. I thought you wanted to know. -What happens now? -You'll be released the day after tomorrow. one hour apart. Felix first. From now on you can reach me on the cell phone around the clock. So if you hear anything, whatever ... Have you been on holiday? -State? -Ow ... Hope you don't have any plans. We have no stand in. What the hell! id they release you or did you escape? Well ... -What is wrong with you? -Tell me what the hell happened. -I don't know what you mean. -We trust each other? I asked you, who trusts anybody. Do you trust me? Do you trust me?! Are you kidding me? I have sat in jail for three days. You put someone to spy on me. Careful now, Frank. don't cross the border. You put yourself in the shit. I didn't go into the fucking car. -I'm not talking about some tail light. -What are you talking about? Is there anyone you know, right? What? Come on. Just. It is good for business. How about this? Someone you know? -Have you taken it? -Yes. It is good. But I saw you didn't come out from the apartment. I'm a bit better spy than you are. And the cops? Was it you who got them there too? What do you think? I think you are good, Frank. Really good. Excuse me, but I have to check everyone I will work with. -I didn't know we cooperated. -Now you know it. -Welcome to Sweden. -Thank you very much! My name Asim Popov. They are my colleagues Lukic and Zivkovic. Frank Wagner, Swedish arms expert. -Nice to meet you. -Zivkovic. -I need your expertise. -For what? A rescue mission. Everything is arranged. I know I'm not God's best child- -But I don't deserve to end this way. You don't deserve this. Fly home with the kids tomorrow. Leave Sweden before anything happens. But if you don't survive then? What awaits me here there is no life either. I promise you. It can only get better. I don't how to do it. Popov's guys do it. We manage our part. If I do a job, I must know what it is. This is no regular job. Then they didn't only have surveillance on you. They've looked into all of us. They are soldiers. If they are so fucking NATO, we fix there without someone on the inside. There's no escape from the outside. Especially not close to the Riksbank. It is well, right? -You have never been a family guy. -What? If you haven't been busy with the right people- -So maybe you'd have found out something about them. Say to my brother Frank who associated with. Yes, she is working in some office and turn the paper in an office. Stop the car. Stop the car, I say. Stop the car! Is your brother a bloody pimp? Martin was printed in one week. When Felix is behind this, it's your bastard brother - I'll fuck him so hard in the ass he won't be able to sit till 2015. -Ok. Are you ready there? -I'm done there. How to ... It was pure coincidence we saw it. Gisson and Alm wanted to eat hamburgers at the port. don't ask me why, but so be it. You know, life. They see a black van parked just around the corner from the shed. Out go two dudes and a chick carrying a camera bag and something shit. The guys are thinking "We hooks on them." Where do you think they go? They go down Sk?negatan. Are you with me? Who are we exempt? You fucking pussy! I won't join in if I don't get any information. His name is Milo Komacek. He is Serbian. He is waiting for Hisingen to be flown to The Hague. -Is he a war criminal? -I don't know. But Popov waits with someone from Serbia- To help him so Komacek will miss the plane. We will handle the practical, stuff ... cars, weapons, maps ... Then we will keep a low profile. The alternative is that we have the cops after us the rest of our lives. Perhaps you want that? Come on. Four Millars. We must. You get one, I'll take one. 800 in expenses and the rest for the guys. As I said, it's up to you. Four ... Wait. Is there anything of this that only you know? Seth told me, so you can't use it. Is there anybody who's ever thanked you? I do it because I haven't a choice. Yes, but thanks anyway. What you do, don't talk in prison. -How fucking stupid are we! -No ... I just want to ... I just want to tget out of here now. If any of this happens, people will die. Guaranteed. Mmm. There is one thing ... everyone knows, not just me. We're looking for two vans as ordered. All right. Place? Chevy, covered, pre-1999 models, before they had electronic locks. -Have you any idea where to look? -LDE and idea ... I would take a chance on self-service. -"Self"? What? -Ask your colleagues. There is a Chevy there. How do we do with it? I called. They are on the road with a tow truck. -Tow truck, then? -Yes. What the hell do you think? -don't be here all night now. -No, Rojas will relieve me at four. Great. When we reviewed. No. I have no issue, Roger! can't you just send it? ... Helen, John, Nina and Ola's answering machine. Leave a message. Hey, baby. It's me. I thought you'd call yesterday. We haven't talked in a while and ... Yes, call me when you can. Bye! Yes, sometimes it's nice to have a profession to be married. That's what's in store with the Norwegian last week ... Yes, you can't help to see things. There you noticed also. All right. But you ... It doesn't mean you're talking about it. We have a way to talk about things we should know. Goodbye. -Hey! -Now, something happened at Landvetter. -Both cars? -Yes. GPS working? -Yes, perfectly. -Then, just wait. -Yes. Hello! How do you know I'm not asleep now? Maybe because it rings every place in the whole apartment. You're a sick bastard, John. Yes, I know. I bought some scones. Are you hungry? -Yes, that's me. -Good. -If I let you out. -Yes, would you do it? Fools errand! They get a hell of a get away. How many are they? The order was for 12 Kalashnikovs, so it is hardly less than that. That means three or four cars. At least. To be fuelled up and deployed. -How many are we? -You, me, Martin and Felix. Then Kenneth Elm and Mack Gisson. Some I wouldn't dare talk to. Six people? To fix an emergency a fucking mini-war? Please, Frank! don't be so negative all the time. We usually work like this. -We usually don't mess with war criminals. -It's not working with old soldiers, either. Use your imagination. Suppose- You are a cop, and your car is hit by an armour-piercing grenade. Isn't it a bit messy before you can continue to hunt? It is Niki. Sorry to disturb, but Felix is down there. -Release him. -Ok. Close the door! Will we kill the entire police escort? Whatever they choose to do, then we're finished with our role. It's getting worst than the fucking Palme murder! You know how much money there is in there. If we don't do it, someone else will earn it. -Seth? -What is it? I have a date. It's going down. They move Komacek next Friday. No one threatened. But transportation starts at seven to avoid traffic. -How do we get here? -Angered Way, across the bridge. -Not how. With what? -The cars. Are you completely gone? You mean you ...? -Where are you going now? -Outside. Completely legally parked. You can't fucking mean you'll drive across town. Are you a stupid fucking bastard?! First you stole a car outside my restaurant? Are you stupid in the fucking head, boy? Will the cops come here before we even had time to start? Not so ... Need I explain this to you? Apparently. Then I explain it slowly so can you take. What happens, Felix, if somebody catches sight of the car tonight? What if the cops take us and hold us after the time we're supposed to start? Do you think we can finish on time? Do you believe it, I ask?! Seth, for hell. I would ... No, no! Come and check out, Frank. Come here. What the hell is that? It is UV-sticker. Then we're under surveillance. They put it on so they can see it from a helicopter. Then they can follow us in their cars. Take care of this, Martin? Clean both the cars of everything that shouldn't be there. Will you? Can you fix it? Keys. -Has it been easy? -How quiet all the time. Not a problem. Get dressed and get in the car! Good morning. Would you like coffee? A little breakfast? I'll take something when I arrive. I'm already late. Shall we talk even less now to each other? It is clear we shouldn't. I just have to ... Is it Ok? Yes. Absolutely. It is fine. -I'll take the bus. -Ok. See ya. -Hey! I'm on the road. I'll be there in five. -Good. -The two vans are back. -What do you mean? On Landvetter. Neatly parked, as if nothing had happened. -Surveillance cameras then? -Two guys with hoods as before. They know we know. We can plug in other departments. Now? What do you say to them without our guy getting killed? -We must be creative. -I understand it. A GPS in every car. How the hell have they managed to do that? We didn't know which car we'd take. How the hell could they know? Come on! Who is it? There must be someone in the gang. Your little pimp may babble. You think I'm talking jobs with the girl? You are obviously stupid enough to drive through the whole town with a stolen getaway car. Shut up now, both of you! You are standing and chattering as two stoned squirrels. We don't know how can cops know this. We only know that they do. So far we agree, don't we? It can't be anybody here. Listen and do as I say. From now on, don't do anything alone. Sleep, eat, shit, piss, fuck ... Any strange behaviour and I want to know about it immediately. Nothing what we said applies any more. Here and now we are starting from scratch. Gisson and Alm join in from now on. What's up? We know this - for sure? -Pretty. Komacek will be released, but we don't know by whom? Well, we know that. I got it from a source in Europol, who received it through a contact in Serbia. 12 soldiers, it might be more, excluding Komacek- When he's being escorted to Landvetter Airport next Friday. All are Serbs? No Swedes? The leader is Asim Popov. According to Europol, he's Komacek's second in command during the Balkan War. Nowadays a mercenary. He was here butt we didn't act on it? -As you didn't even tell us. -We didn't realize the extent before. -But the list? Armour-piercing shells -And you don't understand the scale? You may not be too smart anyway. We're where we are now. Komacek is not a soft guy either. With his background, he'll be rotting in the Hague, and he knows it. So what do we do? As I see it, we have two ways out. Preferably driving fast as hell before they intercept the shiment Say nothing to anybody, not even in the office. The alternative is we give them as many escorts as we can. Cordon off streets, alert National Intelligence, everyone ... You didn't answer if any Swedes are involved. No. I'll examine how soon we can move Komacek- I'll get down to the National Task Force directly. We'll get back together later ... ... Two hours? All right. It isn't me, Seth. I know. Satan ... I know. So what do you suggest? we better get him out now, he'll never forgive us. -I know the guy. -I understand. Listen here. All my people are working two by two so they monitor each other. So if one of them is talking to the police he's out of contention. Do you understand? The time to change prisoner transport is right now. What the hell do you suggest? I don't know. What do you think? I suggest we do it now. What do you mean by "now"? Now immediately? -Yes. Now. -You can't. First of all, you don't have time to get us the rest of your people. Lucky for me I trust you, Seth. Hello. So yes. Wait a minute. It is ... Frank Wagner Auto Service. All right. All right. Yep. Yes. -What did he say? -We have received a major task. -Nothing more? -No, hell ... It's in the stomach. We are one step ahead. -There is more, huh? -Some. I'll just lock up again. I will. You! Come back and help me. Come on. pack it better, so it doesn't rattle around. Not a problem. They check each other now. We're probably not more distant. Sophie?
