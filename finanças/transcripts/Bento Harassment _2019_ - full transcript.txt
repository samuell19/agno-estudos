Kentaro 5 years old Cartoon bento What's this? Fight!, Fight!, Fight! Hello! Hello! Where's Futaba? She went home. What about club activities? She quit. Well, Then we're off. Bye. Fight!, Fight! Where have you been? I heard you quit the club. Wait a minute. It doesn't matter if you go or not. As long as you're okay. What do you want to do? It's no use telling you. What's with your attitude? When you speak it's all useless, useless, useless. You haven't said a single word. Poetry? Alone in the universe I am alone in the universe. In this corner, there's nothing I can do. No one can hear me. I can't speak up. It's safe. The flowers are blooming. It's cold out here. Is it just me? I am lost. I am alone in the universe. You dropped this. You didn't read it, did you? Read what? Poetry. Cool. Futaba writes poetry too. I wrote too, at her age. I just remember it, I’m too shy and sweating on my back. Yeah, I know. I feel like I'm gonna die. Embarrassed to look at yourself in the mirror. What's with your tone, you sound like an old lady? Because I am. But I'm worried she's really upset. The darkness of the soul and such. Here you go again, Worrying blindly. So what if it is? Tell me something. Hello. I have been watching your blog recently I'm a single father who's not good at cooking. Next time, can I imitate your lunchbox? Thank you for reading my blog Please do as you please. Great! Kentaro 5 years old Forget it. Eh? It's already this late? No side dishes. Thanks for the food. what's that? Is that a zombie? I failed. But can you teach me how to make a bento... This is a picture of me and my son. Yeah, sure. Great! Then please. Let's start with the simplest cartoon lunch. First of all is the foundation. The octopus sausage. First cut the small sausage diagonally in half Cut it four more times so it becomes like an octopus feet. Fry until all four legs are fully open, okay. Ingredients should be rich in color The richer the color, the more balanced the nutrition The eyes of the octopus are made of cheese taken out of a straw. The rest of the cheese can't be wasted. Eat it. Good morning! Good morning! Off you go! Kentaro, enjoy your lunch today. If you'll excuse me. Thanks for the food. Wow! What is it? It's a little octopus. So cool! So cute! Octopus sausage. Octopus sausage? - It's too easy. - Is it wrong to put octopus sausages? Just try one. The usual octopus sausage. Why is that? She probably won't be making any more bentos you hate. Think about it. You're not going to the club all of a sudden. She doesn't know what you're thinking. She's a mystery to us, too. Hey, hey, check this out. Teaching Tokyo single-parent dad a cartoon bento? Looks pretty handsome, doesn't it? - Single father. - Single mother. It feels good. Huh? What are you guys doing? Oh, Tatsuo! We're having lunch. Still a cartoon bento? It feels different today. There are stories of grown-ups. It's nothing. She must love you very much, your mother. My mom never made me a bento. Just business. But it doesn't matter to me who prefers to play drums. Hey you... I'll take one. Bye-bye. Ready to go. Okay. Oh, my God. Take it easy. Why did you take your clothes off? Don't stare. Eh? You've always liked him, haven't you? My brother who grew up next door. I heard that he was dating Sayaka from his regular class. Why don't you do something? Or you'll lose to your mother. Those are two different things. Tatsuo, is getting more and more handsome, isn't he? He used to so thin like a bean sprouts. Loves to eat bean sprouts. That look like a bean sprouts. Now he has become such a good young man with too much temperament. It's summer. Make a decision this summer. So annoying! Annoying! Annoying! Annoying! Annoying! Annoying She actually said it 6 times. Eh? What is it? Let me see. Ah, wait a minute… No, no, no, no. How about that? Excuse me? Nothing. Let's eat. Let's eat. Kentaro. Kentaro. It's okay, Kentaro. Daddy's here. It's okay. it's okay. It's all right. Why didn't mom come back? Because I'm crying? Does mom hate me? It's not your fault that mom didn't come back. It's okay. Mommy. It's okay. Although he only cried for a while. But I know, it’s not okay to only have a father. - Ah, If you please... Sorry to tell you these unhappy things. Even if you say don't be too sad. It's still sad, isn't it? It's been 12 years and I still feel the same way. Thank you for sending me a message, Shinsuke-san. That being said, I'm sorry telling you my troubles. Actually, my wife died about six months ago. It was sudden. My son always thought that because of his crying that her mother died. Let me know if it's convenient. What happened to you at the time? Futaba is staying at my house tonight. You should have told me earlier. You have the ability to speak for yourself. So annoying! She's so annoying. Annoying than the rainy season. It’s necessary to escape at this time. Here comes the meal Omelet Rice. Let's eat! When my daughter was young Let's eat! When my daughter was young We were a very happy family. My husband love our daughters and our daughters love their father. One night, When I was making dinner, I found out that I ran out of salt. So my husband went to buy it. Then my husband got hit by a big truck running a red light. If I didn't ask him to buy salt... It's been hard living with this remorse. If my husband is not here, can I take care of our children? I have to live your life the way you did when my husband was still alive. And I tried so hard. Futaba, listen to your sister. Wakaba, I'll leave it to you. I'm off to work. The fever hasn't gone away yet. But I have to go. Wakaba, will you help your sister change her pajamas? I'm off to work. But soon, my eldest daughter started asking for help. Mom, I don't know what to do. What do you mean? Futaba keeps crying everytime you go to work. I'm so tired. Come to Mommy. Come here. I never noticed that. I'm sorry. Spend more time with them, even if you're broke. So I work less. I thought I'd finally be able to take care of them. But it didn't. I thought I could take good care of them, but my kid has entered a period of rebellion. Why should we go to the restaurant I was very angry and started to make her a nasty bento. Feels like a boy who deliberately messes with the girl he likes just to get her attention. Exactly. But I've always care. I can't do my mother's job when it's time to take care of her. When she's rebellious, she's not allowed to be rebellious. Let's work hard together. Yeah, that's right. Let's work hard. Okay, don't be sad. I won't stop messing with my daughter until she changes her mind. Long time no see. We are comedians, Nippon Electric Power. Every day, she's keeps making nasty bento. Whether it's a rainy day Windy days Bento has nothing to do with the weather, does it? Be cautious, let your voice go! Be cautious and let go of your voice On snowy days Be cautious and let go of your voice On snowy days Does Hachijo even snow? The day of making bento continues throughout the year. Her daughter is now in junior high. I like spring very much. GO, like Sagawa Kiyoshi I like spring very much. GO, like Sagawa Kiyoshi In the blink of an eye, summer is over and autumn has arrived Six months before graduation. A lot of things to decide. No, no, no, no. What's your plan after graduation? Have you decided which university you would go to? Please let me know. I mean, I can't do anything about it, but I can help you look into it a little bit. I'm talking to you. Ah, yes. it's the weekend. You're cleaning up. When you cleaned before This place is still dusty. Let me tell you I want you to clean all corners... and you're not listening. I didn't expect you to make that kind of bento for her. After all, I've decided to do it until she changes her attitude. I made up my mind, I should stick to it. You have to set a good example for your children. You're right, but is it really okay to keep going like this? But it will be over soon. I already plan to stick to it until she graduates. I guess she's not feeling well. Don’t you want to find your own happiness? I'm happy. This is delicious. I want another drink. Ah, how's it going with him? The single dad in Tokyo. What else can I do? That's hard to say, right? Yeah. What, yeah? Don't be ridiculous. Will Futaba leave the island? Did she say that? I don't know yet, anyway. Determine early where to graduate Determine early where to graduate. Determine early where to graduate Determine early where to graduate. So annoying! You're right, it's so annoying. But I know it's out of concern, though. Eh? Have you been scouted? Yeah, I think so. I heard that I can continue glee club after college. I decided to go to a special school. Futuba, are you still considering being a nurse? Yeah, I'm thinking about it. I say I'm thinking about it. But neither true or false. I can't think of a way to come up with a result. Whether I want to do something or get out of here. I don't know why it's been that way all the time. I can't find anything I like. I can't tell anyone what I like.

It has nothing to do with learning. There's only one left. It's not over yet. Futaba is going to Tokyo after graduation. To be separated from us for a long time. Four days before graduation. There's no school or lunch. I wonder what was in Sayaka's bento? Yes. Thunder in this season? That's not good. Why did it suddenly started raining? The laundry's wet. Mom. Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mother Futaba. How's mom? They are still checking. I still don't know yet Really? If only she'd had more rest. It's all my fault. She didn't have to make me bento. When mom decides to do something, there's no one that can stop her. When mom made bento for you, it reminded me of that when I was a kid, mom would worked late every day. It was only the two of us sleeping together. When I woke up in the morning, mom was already up. She made breakfast and went to work. Because we don't have time to talk. So every morning mom puts a letter by the pillow Remember that? Mom must be thinking, "I want them to see the letter.” She must have written everything she wanted to say to you on the bento. Futaba, Sister just went back to work. I see. Did I made you worry? I heard the doctor say That it's an early symptom of a stroke. It's not an emergency, But you're going to be in the hospital for about a week. Not for that long. No. Futaba. I haven't heard so much from you in so long. How can you sleep for so long? There's a delivery coming soon. I have to finish the final bento. The factory can't do without me. There's a delivery coming soon. Oh, I think I just said that. I'm okay. I don't need a break. Um... I don’t know how old you are, but you're getting older. I mean, what's the level of physical fitness like when you're young? Can't you pay more attention to your body? Yes, I see. But you are not talking to me. You ignored me. But I still have to do the bento - After all, it's last. - I don't want it. I decided not to go to Tokyo. What? Anyway, I don't care anymore. It's the same trouble everywhere. Are you saying that because you're worried about me? I'm fine. You can decide what you want to do in the future. Mom was really happy. Pay attention to your body. You sacrificed yourself. That's what bothers me the most. There's no point in doing anything. We're all going to die anyway. Why bother? Let's open a restaurant together. Didn't we make that promise when I was a kid? The three of us running a restaurant together. Let's open a restaurant. Stop it. What? Stop saying those childish words. You're already old. Now you're halfway there. Aren't you ashamed of the people around you? You're about to enter the working society. Stop saying willful words. And even if we had to open a restaurant, What can you do to help? We only fight That is not where you should be. How long do you want to stay with me? Do you have plan to reconcile with mom? I can't I can't control my temper when I see her. So you're leaving the island without seeing each other? Any discomfort? No. Then I'll turn off the light. Thank you. Tomorrow is the graduation ceremony. Yes. What? Why don't you two made up already? You want to send her away too, right? And the last bento. You want to do it for her, Don't you? Forget it. Did he throw his bento? Yes. Kentaro didn’t eat anything, He just threw it away. It's been a while. I didn't notice. I'm really sorry. No. Rock, Paper, Scissors. Kentaro. The teacher told me you threw dad's bento away. Why did you throw away the bento? If you don't say anything, how would dad know? Kentaro. Mommy listens to me. What? Mom will listen to me. But dad won't listen to me at all. Kentaro. That's dangerous. Hello, Kentaro! You're just pushing yourself too hard. Thank you. I thought I was in good health. It's because you stay up all night and make bento. You're such a darling girl. But... I can't help it. Every day, I want to be a better mother. But it's always not good. Kentaro! And then it gets really frustrating. Kentaro! I worried about her being independent enough to live alone. Before you know, you can't control your emotions. And then regret it afterwards. Kentaro! These kids are a real pain in the ass. Pathetic. Eat. Okay. It's so annoying. Cute and pathetic. I can't help it. I want to hug her tightly. Kentaro, I'm sorry. Dad thought you were gonna like those cartoon lunches. You're not happy about that. Still can't do it like Mom. Dad's an idiot. Only a stupid would call someone stupid. No, dad's calling himself an idiot, so it's not a conflict. You've said it idiot twice, it's not good. I mean… Dad. Why don't you make me another hiragana bento? What? You can do it. Got it. Dad, got it. Let's do it together. You must be hungry. Let's go home and cook. Okay. Okay, let's go. Kentaro. It was you, dad. You caught me. This was written by Kentaro. Wakaba. What is it? Can you do me a favor? Come on, Come on, hurry up. You told me to buy all the stuff here. Call me as soon as you feel something's wrong. Right away. Right away. Don't push yourself. I know. Then I leave you to it. Wakaba. Thank you. Don't forget my share this time. Bye. Let's go. Is there anything wrong Kaori-san? No. Then I'll turn off the light. Okay. - Futaba, here. - What's this? A mysterious gift for you. - It's heavy. - What's the mystery? Congratulation on graduating. Then I'm off to school. Go ahead. It's so heavy. Go on. Graduation ceremony It ’s too heavy. Why on the last day... Forgive me It's so heavy. - Let me help you. - It's okay. Too heavy. Stand up. Bow. Have a seat. Tokyo Metro Hachijoji High School. The graduation ceremony will begin. I'm a little embarrassed that you guys care so much. It's heavy. It's really heavy. Clear the table over there. Here, Move it over here. That too. Thank you. It's heavy. What the hell is in it? What could it be? It's really big. What could it be? - It's amazing. - It's amazing. Excuse me. Thank you. - Is the rice below? - Is it rice? - What could it be? - What could it be? Letter of commendation to my dear daughter. For the past three years, my mother has been making you embarassing bento every day. - MOM. Your mother is amazing I'm sorry. Let's eat together. I can't eat this alone. All right, everybody. - Let's eat. - Let's eat. Thank you. It's delicious. That's amazing. -This is so cute.-This is so cute. Her mother is amazing. Goodbye. How's your recovery? Ah, almost recovered. It's fine. Don't worry. I found this at home. It's from Futaba. take care Thank you, mom will take it. I'll buy something hot. Well, thank you. To mom. I remember the first time when I saw your cartoon bento in high school, My friends say it's so cute. And I don't think it's cute at all. But what struck me was, These bentos were made by yourself, not bought. Every day you work until midnight. But you always get up at 5 in the morning and busy in the kitchen preparing my bento. I'm really touched. Every time you ask me, is it delicious? Although I'm always silent. But I really like mom’s cooking. That's why I want to work something related to cooking. I'm going to Tokyo. Although this is still in Tokyo. I don't know when I can come back to this island. But... I'll try to do it so I don't regret it. Like you said, your efforts are not wasted. If I see you, I'll lose my temper. So I wrote you a letter. Just like mom used to write for us when I was little. Although, Mom, you can be really scary sometimes. Always do the strangest thing, but I love you from the bottom of my heart. I want to be like you mom. In the end, Thank you for never missing in three years. Thank you for all the nasty bento. Thank you for doing this for me for so long. I'm listening to you. Your rebellious daughter. W-what's going on? What's going on? What is it? My chest hurts like a needle. No, doctor. Doctor! - Doctor. - Wakaba. I still want to see her off. What? Please. Please. Hurry up and drive safely. There's a bike. So annoying! We must catch up. Come on, come on. Look to your left. Devil I see it. I see it. Futaba! Mommy loves you! Mommy loves you! Mom! Please take care! Take care! Please take care! I'm going! Have a safe trip! Have a safe trip! Let's eat it together. Okay. Here. Take care, mom. -Okay, Let's eat. - Let's eat. Delicious. Delicious. Look at you. It's all over your mouth. - I'll do it. - Thank you. - Let me know when you're done. - Okay. - Can you hold that for me? - Yeah. Did you find it? What's to eat? It's the ocean. Isn't that raw egg bibimbap? I see. Eh? What? Eh? What? Nice to finally meet you. What's wrong with you? Nice to meet you. By the way, this is my son Kentaro. Say hello. - Hello.
