Aurelius! Here's another letter from Eddie, begging me to come live with him. Well, it's only natural. He wants his father near him. But you wouldn't be happy in the city. And we couldn't do without you, anyhow. Bless you, that's the sweet Lord shining through. Brother Sheffey, there's no way I could pay you back for what you've done for folks all over these mountains-- including me and my own kin. Yes? Does Robert Sheffey live here? Yes, he does indeed. Come in. That's Brother Sheffey. Sit down. My eyes have faded, and I don't recognize you. What's on your heart, my young brother? Oh, uh, well, I’d better tend to some chores . . . outside. I'm sorry to run you out. Oh, it happens about twice a week. Folks come from all over to get help from Brother Sheffey. I want you to forgive me for something. What do you want me to forgive you for? You'll hate me. Hate you? Hate me and despise me. Oh, God, forgive me and save my wretched soul! Son, whatever it is, telling me doesn't count for much, but telling Jesus will take away the sin, no matter how big. I can't tell Him. Not until I’ve come here. I’ve got to tell you that . . . but I can't. A peace that's made with God doesn't need the forgiveness of man. But there was a time, I’ll admit, when I didn't think this way. I was about your age when I found the Lord, and I guess I was just about as worthless a sinner as there could be. Robert? [Aunt Elizabeth] Where are you going? Out. Please come in here where I can hear you. Now then, I asked you where are you going? I was going to meet some-- friends. It isn't necessary to be vague, Robert. I know very well who your friends are. But I was speaking of your purpose. Perhaps you've considered returning to college. I don't think college suits me. What does suit you, Robert? It was your late uncle's wish that you would be provided with a fine business opportunity, but you haven't shown the slightest initiative. Your life is worthless, Robert. Uncle James was just about the richest man in this part of the county, but now he's dead and what good did his money do him? It's taken care of you in fine style, for which you don't even seem to have common gratitude. I'm sorry, Aunt Elizabeth. It's just that there must be more to life than making money. It seems like everybody's running around like a headless chicken, trying to get things and do things without a real purpose. My head's like a bumblebee's nest. I don't know what I'm looking for. Whatever it is, I'm sure I haven't found it yet. Well, you'd better find it soon. And in the meantime, I will thank you not to bite the hand that feeds you. Do try to join the family for the evening meal. [Muley] I says to him, "My sins have been laying heavy on my heart lately, preacher. I think I’ll be there." [laughter] [Muley] Hey, Robert! Come on in! You're just in time here. Clefus, me, and Shem here we're all going up to the revival meetin'. Come on! We need to do something fun. Oh, look at Robert there. He's so somber, he could sour milk. But he needs to be tee-totally saved. Oh say, that's what my mama's always telling me. Now, Clefus, there's nothing more fun than a revival meetin', especially if you got some corn cobs. You can kind of liven the place up a bit. Now you're talkin'. Come on! Let's go pelt the old sin socker. [congregation singing "Brethren We Have Met to Worship"] ♪ Will you pray with all your power, ♪ ♪ While we try to preach the Word? ♪ ♪ All is vain unless the Spirit ♪ ♪ Of the Holy One comes down; ♪ ♪ Brethren, pray, and holy manna ♪ ♪ Will be showered all around. ♪ Be seated, friends. Be seated. Our service is almost over, but God's plan is so simple it doesn't need a long sermon to explain it. Our scripture deals with the prophet Elijah. By the hand of God, Elijah was taken into heaven in a fiery chariot . . . You reckon my mules will catch fire on the way home? Be not deceived. God is not mocked. Some of you have come here tonight without knowing why you're here. There may be those in this room who have been searching for something without knowing what they're looking for. This Bible teaches us that we're all sinners. it also says that sinners can have no fellowship with God. Maybe that's what you've been looking for The comforting hand of . . . [gasps from congregation] Well, this book teaches us how we can have that comfort. Come on, Robert. You get him. No! Let him alone. [preacher] God so loved the world He sent His son Jesus down from heaven to be a sacrifice for our sins. All we have to do is . . . All we have to do is accept God's offer. It's a free gift. What's wrong with you? I got to hear him out. [Muley] Wasn't hurtin' nothing, Robert. We was just havin' some fun. I'm all right. My glasses. The commotion seems to be about over, friends. Be seated and we'll finish the service. Now look here-- look at this Bible. God's offering us a free gift, and all we have to do is ask Him for it. I'm going to ask God to give courage to anyone who feels God's Holy Spirit urging him to come forward, and see from the Bible how to be saved. Well, the service is over for tonight, folks. Thank you and good night. I'm sorry for what they . . . what we did. They're really not so bad. Most of the crying anguish in hell'll surely come from people who don't think themselves bad. Now, son, is that why you came up here? To apologize to me? No. In God's sight, all men without Christ are equally bad. Preacher, what you said about searching. I'm the one you were talkin'. . . Preacher, is it as easy as you say it is? It is. Say, you sound educated. Can you read? Yes. Then read this. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. What's your name, son? Robert. Robert Sheffey, sir. Well, Robert Sheffey, do you believe this book? Yes. Then all you have to do is ask God's forgiveness and be saved. Can I do it now? You can do it now. Robert's late again. [door opens and closes] You're late, Robert. I'm sorry, Aunt Elizabeth. I apologize. Well, come on in and have your supper. Aunt Elizabeth, there's something I want to tell you. Yes, Robert? Aunt Elizabeth, everybody, there's something I’ve got to say. You've already told us that, Robert. Yes, well I . . . I accepted the Lord tonight. [Aunt Elizabeth] You what? Where have you been? At a revival meeting. Robert, I should like to speak to you in the other room. Does our family church not suit your liking? I never heard there what I heard tonight. We are not sheep of itinerants. Aunt Elizabeth, I didn't mean to hurt you. Is that what you want? To shame us? To tear down the good name of your dead uncle? Aunt Elizabeth . . . I have tried to bring you and your brother up as my own sons, with dignity, with proper religious instruction. If you had to make some sort of commitment, why couldn't you have done it in a more gentlemanly manner, and in your own church? I didn't make some sort of commitment. I was saved. And I didn't do it in our church because no one ever asked me. It will be hard to forgive you, Robert, if you insist on continuing to humiliate me. I'm not trying to humiliate you. I thought you'd be happy. I thought you'd be glad I became a Christian. Robert, you were born a Christian and reared a Christian. We are not weeping, breast-beating, repentant sinners like farmers at a campground meeting. Religion is a good thing. No one believed that more strongly than your uncle and I. But religion, like anything else, has its proper place. I have tried to give you a good start in life, but you will never amount to anything unless you learn to . . . to control your emotions. I’ll give you a day or two to think this over, Robert. After you have calmed down, you will come to me and apologize for your rash behavior. I’ll apologize for nothing. I’ve done the right thing. The only thing I’ve been wrong about has been the misplaced values of this family. I’ll not humiliate you any more. Whoa, boy. Let's go. Come on. [man preaching] People have been coming to Jesus for almost 2000 years, and no one has ever been cast out. God says to all those that will come unto Him He will in no wise cast out. Won't you come and accept Jesus? No doubt there are those here who have been putting off this final decision for years, and you know you ought to be saved, but you keep telling God,"No, not yet." But one day God's mercy will come to an end. Perhaps there are those in this room who have loved ones, a mother, a wife, a husband, who's spent hours on their knees praying for you to come to Christ. Come on. What are you waiting for? If God's Spirit is speaking to you, why don't you give in? It would be a terrible thing to hear the gospel, and you know that Christ died for your sins. You know you ought to be saved, and you leave this room tonight unsaved. You may never have another opportunity. You may never come this close again. Just think of the rejoicing in heaven over one soul that God loves when he quits fighting and comes to Him. And there will be a special blessing for God's servant who points that soul to Christ and urges him to overcome that final barrier. Lord, we thank Thee for this soul that has come to Thee. Will thou dismiss us with thy love and mercy, in Jesus name. Amen. May the Lord bless you, my dear brother. Do we have a visiting circuit rider in our midst? Oh, no. I’m not a preacher. I just spoke a word of encouragement to a man that needed it. Well then, God's hand is on the exhorter as well as the preacher. Do you consider this work your calling? I don't know. You said I was a servant, a servant of God. And so you are. You have done God's service already. I'm Cass Wilkerson. I'm Robert Sheffey. [Wilkerson] I’m proud to meet you, Robert. Say, I wonder. You sound like you might have some education. I went to college for a while. Well, listen. I’ve got a proposition for you. We've been looking for a teacher for our children. We can't pay much, but . . . I’ll take it. It's only $30 a . . . I’ll take it. My present situation doesn't suit me very well, and . . . and I’ll take it. Fine. By the way, I noticed what you did here. We don't have a regular preacher or circuit rider at the forge. Maybe you could double as our pastor . . . I'm not qualified . . . Well, I saw you speak . . . I couldn't speak to a group. Well, it doesn't matter. I don't know a thing about you, Robert Sheffey, but I’ve got a feeling you're going to make a fine teacher for our children. Is it a bargain? Yes, sir. [woman] Howdy, Cass. Howdy, Bertha. Guess this must be the new schoolteacher. Just like I promised. Bertha, I’d like for you to meet Robert Sheffey. How do you do? Robert, this is Mrs. Kincannon. We were hoping you'd still make that extra room available. [Mrs.Kincannon] Sure can. Robert will want to see his room and get washed up for supper. Good day. Mrs. Kincannon. Come along, Robert. If the room suits your liking, it'll be $10 a month, including meals. Washing will be extra though. Well, what do ya think? Do you think I can teach children, Mrs. Kincannon? Apparently Mr. Wilkerson thought so. He doesn't know anything about me. I promised him I’d get a letter of reference from college, but that won't prove I can teach or do anytng else. What makes you think you can't teach? I’ve never been able to speak in front of a group any group. I just can't say anything. Maybe it's because you never had anything really important to say. I mean something you really believed in. Mrs. Kincannon, I feel like-- like God has something for me to do, but I don't know what it is. He wouldn't ask me to do something I couldn't do, would He? No, He wouldn't, but He might want something you just don't know you can do yet. God is our friend to love and talk to as we talk to our mothers and fathers. that You're so near to us constantly. And I pray, Lord, that You will be with these children and help them to see Your beauty, in Jesus name, amen. [children] . . . and health and strength and eyes that I might see. [applause] You did fine. Well, school's out for spring planting and summer. What are you going to do with yourself? I don't know for sure. Teaching has helped me. But my calling's in another direction. I heard there's a revival going on over at Saltville. Maybe I could ride over there and lend a hand. Oughtn't you to take a little time for yourself? Maybe make a visit back to see your aunt. I said I’d never go back, and I won't. She shamed me without mercy, and it's hard to forgive her. Besides, she probably wishes to see me even less than I wish to see her. Hello, there. Hello yourself, laddy. Have you traveled far? Been traveling two days now. I spent the night back alongside the road. I found out these spring nights are still cold. Aye, that they are lad. I was hoping you might have room for a lodger. I have money to pay, of course. Well, let's have a look at you. You're not a drummer, as you have no wares. No, I’m not a peddler. I'm a teacher when school's in session. Right now I'm . . . I'm just a servant of the Lord. I'm Robert Sheffey. Well, now. I’m Shed McComb. And you're in luck, lad. We got ham and black-eyed peas, and there's only me and my good wife. You're welcome to stay, lad. Come on inside. Ellie. So you're headed to a revival at Saltville? How long will you be preaching? Oh, I’m not the preacher. I'm just going to try and be of some help. How's that, lad? Sometimes a word of encouragement or testimony, spoken at the right time can make the difference. It's all a man needs to decide to accept the Lord. While we're on the subject, I hope you won't take it amiss . . . Oh, lad, I know what you'll be asking, and we don't take it amiss at all. But the fact is that Ellie and I, well, we're both trusting the Lord. Shed, what about the church? What about it? Well, Mr. Sheffey here could do it. Of course he could. I should have thought of it. What church? Our church. I helped build it. Uh, but, we don't have a preacher yet, not a regular one at least. We're in need of a good sermoner. You could do it. I could no more preach than rise and fly. Now, lad, an empty church house is the devil's delight. Now suppose we . . . suppose we just disappoint him a bit with a sermon? But I can't preach. We don't need a fancy sermon, lad. Just tell us what the Lord has laid on your heart. Surely that's why He sent you to us. I’ll try. I'm not promising anything, but I’ll try. I’ll be back through here soon. Maybe, I can do it then. It's time, lad. Everyone's here. The place is full. Dear . . . Dearly beloved, I’d like to speak today from the book of . . . Genesis. The message from the Scripture today is . . . The message is . . . The message is . . . Let me go. Easy. I’ve got to get out of here. Easy now, lad. I’ll not let you fail, Brother Sheffey. You're God's man. I'm sure of that now. How? I’ve failed. I’ve made a fool of myself. No, no! So you're afraid. So what of that? It shows you've a proper respect for your responsibilities. 'Tis a fearful thing to preach the Word of God. But I’ll not let you quit. Not if I have to carry you back in there myself. What would I say? Just tell us. . . . Tell us anything. Tell us your testimony. How you were come to the Lord. And that's how I came to accept the Lord. I went to the revival for the worst reason, but God, in his mercy, overruled. Just as He overruled here today. Lord, don't let us forget that when You give us Your commands, You give us the strength we need-- but not more than we need, because then we proud critters would take the credit ourselves. We ask this, in the name of Jesus our Savior, amen. I knew it. I knew you were sent of purpose to preach the Word of God to us. I'm thinking the devil is more than a little unhappy today, lad. You done well, brother. Thank you, brother. You done wonderful, brother. Thank you. Ma'am. Thank you. Whoa. Well, old friend, that wasn't so bad. [horse snorts] All right, I admit it was a little tough at first. But you know, old friend? The Lord was helping me. I could feel it. Maybe I could be a preacher-- that is, if that's what the Lord wanted me to be. And it's beginning to look as if He does. I'm afraid Mr. . . . Uh . . . Sheffey, that the presiding elder does not find your request for license to preach to be in order. You simply cannot expect the examining committee to put its stamp of approval on a person of your . . . uh, irregular background. Irregular? Very little college training, and, uh, no seminary or theological training. But many of the circuit riders are hardly educated at all. Mr. Sheffey, we have done some checking into your background. And? We found that you were a man of some ambition, sincere, perhaps, but that you are a bit peculiar in your actions. Peculiar? Look, I don't know what you've heard . . . I’ll speak quite frankly. We've heard, for example, that when you're supposed to be teaching school, you, instead, take the children out into the woods and tell them stories. Well, yes, but . . . Well, there's more. There's your praying. It's abnormal. You've been observed praying for hours by the side of the road, and your prayers in your classroom are unnatural, too. One boy reported that you sound as if you are talking right to God. That may be so, but tell me, to whom do you talk when you pray? Be that as it may, Mr. Sheffey, we do not want our licensed preachers acting in peculiar ways. But the Bible says anyone who preaches the Word of God will be considered peculiar by the rest of the world. I doubt if your wandering all over the mountains can be considered preaching. At least, not from what I’ve heard. I do the best I can with the talents God has given me. No doubt. Mr. Sheffey, why don't you reconsider your calling. Perhaps you could do some good among the simpler classes. I will. I certainly will. Thank you very much for your advice. And you may be assured that I will pursue whatever God calls me to do, with or without your official sanction. Of course, no one can keep you from going about as an unlicensed itinerant. Good day, Mr. Sheffey. [Mrs.Kincannon] Here's some side meat, dried beans. Now what you're going to cook them in I don't know. So far most folks have been pretty gracious to take me in. Be sure you don't wear your welcome out. Mrs. Kincannon, I never accept a family's hospitality unless I’m sure God's laid it on their hearts to help me. Robert, you're like a child. I never saw anybody so sure of what God wanted him to do. I'm as sure as if I got one of those newfangled telegraph messages. Maybe in a way I have. Jesus simply went about doing good and preaching everywhere He went and I want to pattern my ministry after His. I don't need man's approval as long as the sweet Lord can lead me by His Word and His Spirit. I’ll be back in a few months. Goodbye, Bertha. Where ya headed first? Up towards Tazewell. But that's nothing but mountains. It's ten miles between cabins. Nothing but trappers and moonshiners. But they need the gospel, too. Besides, I’m following some theological advice. 'Bye, Robert. Be careful. Well, Gideon. God has given us a beautiful day. Whoa, boy. You know, Gideon I hope Brother Tortoise was going in that direction. Whoa, boy. Probably somebody shooting a squirrel. All right, preacher man. Now get on that there horse of yours and make some tracks. Next time I catch you around here preachin' or prayin', I'm gonna aim just a little lower than your hat. Now you get. You get out of here. I said get. Wait! Come traipsing to pester in other folks' business, mister? [Sheffey] What's this man done to you? I don't suppose it's any of your business. First of all, he's trespassin' on my property. Just like you are. This man's unarmed. Well, I only aimed to scare him a little bit, but I’m beginning to wish I’d saved my bullet for you. I'm a little nervous and kind of careless with this here gun. Now you get your friend and get. Is this your still? Well, now whose else ya think it is? And how much liquor can you run in this still? Well, if everything is going good, I’d run might near 50 gallon a day. Well, what do you do with all that? I sell it. What do you think? [preacher] Yeah, he sells it to broken-down old men. Shut your mouth. I got the liquor for sale, and they don't have to buy it, and there ain't no law against it neither. I suppose you're one of them preachers too. I guess I am. You start your preaching and praying 'round here . . . Dear Lord, You've told us in Your Word that strong drink is wicked and that You despise drunkenness. Lord, we know it's not Your will for this man to be the means of turning other men into wife beaters and child abusers and worthless, drunken idlers. Lord, destroy this still. Make a mighty oak tree to fall on it, and to break it to pieces and destroy it forever. Amen. That's a plumb funny prayer, mister. There ain't an oak tree in 200 yards of this whole place. Don't underestimate God's power. Only the fool says in his heart there is no God. Confound it, mister. You've had time for your preachin' and prayin'. Now get your friend and get on out of here. Let this be fair warning to ya. Next time I find you on my property preachin' and prayin', I'm gonna shoot both of you. Now get out of here. [preacher] That scum. Why does God let people like that live? Why doesn't he just kill them when they get so rotten? Excuse me, brother, but I don't even know your name. Frazier. Tyler Frazier. [Sheffey] You're doing God's work back there. Don't let bitterness in your heart rob you of your blessing. Brother Frazier, you must find forgiveness in your heart for that moonshiner. Why? Because God's Word commands it. God doesn't tell us to forgive what that man's doing. Is it the liquor you're angry with right now? That man's the meanest liquor- maker in Virginia. Look what he did to me. But I say unto you which hear, love your enemies; do good to them which hate you; bless them that curse you; and . . . and pray for them that despitefully use you. But that man's hindering God's work. Yes, and that we must pray and work against, but not the man himself. You must forgive him. Hatred and bitterness in your heart will ruin your own effectiveness for God. [memory of Aunt Elizabeth] You will come to me and apologize for your rash behavior. I’ve got to go. Can you ride on alone? It's only a mile to my cabin. We can spend the night. No, I can't stay. But the weather-- it's going to storm tonight. No matter. I’ve waited too long now. Good-bye. Looks like a bad storm comin'. Let's make haste, old friend. [cracking] Aunt Elizabeth? Is anybody home? Aunt Elizabeth? Aunt Elizabeth! Annie! Why, Mr. Robert, I declare. What happened? Where's Aunt Elizabeth? Ms. White's gone to glory. She's what? Dead. Buried two days. Two days? Annie, I didn't know. They tried to reach you. I’ve been in the wilderness preaching. I wanted to see her. Did she ever mention me? She mentioned you often. She left something for you. You and Ms. White were so much alike. Both of you proud folks. Before she died, she said when you came back here, I was to give you this. Thank you, Annie. [voice of Aunt Elizabeth] "Dear Robert, the sheep is honored by God for its meekness. Ride upon the sheepskin, Robert. Pray upon it, and remember the humility of the sheep. You were right; my values were misplaced. God has shown me that the only thing of true value in this world is salvation through His Son Jesus Christ. I have accepted Him as my Savior. May you continue to follow the Lord and serve Him faithfully all your life. Kind regards, Aunt Elizabeth." She's forgiven me. She knew I’d conquer my own pride. She died trusting the Lord. I wasn't too late. Gideon, a day like this makes me want to shout for joy. I feel like a new creature scrubbed clean. You got to be Robert Sheffey. I'm a servant of the Lord. Do I know you? No, but most everybody around here knows about you. When I heard there was someone up here prayin' alone on the side of the mountain, figured it had to be you so I come up on purpose to meet ya. How long have you been here? Oh, about two hours. Course, that don't count the time it took me to get here after the trapper who saw you up here came by and told us. I'm James Stafford. Pleased to meet ya, Mr. Stafford. I thank the Lord for sendin' you by to encourage me. It's nothing to all the folks you've encouraged all these years. Fact is, I come up on purpose to ask you to take your meal with us. My wife and family be right proud if you would. Well, Gideon, I don't think we'll turn down this invitation, will we? You always talk to your horse that way? Well, Gideon's pretty good company; never disagrees with anything I say. [horse neighs] At least hardly ever. [Sheffey] I guess Gideon will be as glad as I am to get to the campground. He'll have a long time in the clover with nothin' to do but get fat. [Mr.Stafford] Jimmy. Jimmy, take care of preacher Sheffey's horse. Yes, sir. Thank you, son. Listen, you be good to him. Be sure to give him a drink of cool spring water-- fresh, mind ya-- and 12 ears of corn. Yes, sir, I will. Allow you could use a cool drink of water yourself. Come on inside. Thank you; that looks good. [Mr. Stafford] Now that we've met, I should tell you that your name and work are not unfamiliar to this house. We've offered prayers for your work, more than once. I'm obliged to you. That's the most precious favor we can give to each other. Will you offer thanks for us? I will, as soon as our dear sister here is finished. Well, I’m finished now, Mr. Sheffey. Haven't you forgotten the dumplings? I don't always fix dumplings with stewed chicken. Oh. Dear Lord, we thank Thee for this dear family and for their kind hospitality to Thy servant. And we're grateful for these material provisions, but even Thou knowest, Lord, that chicken would be better with dumplings. Amen. Mr. Sheffey, I declare. Now I know you're Robert Sheffey. Everything I’ve heard must be true. Mr. Sheffey, we heard that you were a man of prayer. A man who felt so close to God he could just talk to Him about anything, and I think that's wonderful. I do too, and I want you to consider this your home as you travel-- anytime you pass this way. We can do that for the Lord. The next time we'll have dumplings. Would you speak at our little mountain church? Tell us about your missionary work. [Jimmy] Oh, what about the Indians; do you preach for them? Oh, yes, I have. But there are very few Indians left now in this part of the country. Oh. What about the blacks or is that a dangerous question in these times? Oh, no. I find that the dear black families are as glad to have me in their homes as the white folks, and they usually serve me dumplings. No doubt, your wife serves you dumplings too. I had a wife, but she died about ten years ago. Right sorry to hear that. You expecting a good crowd at the camp meeting? I don't rightly know. The attendance has been off the last few years. [Mr. Stafford] Times are changing, I reckon. Times are, but men and women aren't. We still need the gospel preached. I’d be right sorry to see the end to the camp meeting. It's about the only time all year we get to see anybody much. I doubt Mr. Sheffey would count that a real good reason, Eliza. [Sheffey] Oh, I count the fellowship of God's people one of the main blessings of the meeting. It's a blessed sight to see the preaching shed packed with thousands of folks singing and happy together. And I praise the sweet Lord for hundreds of souls I’ve seen trust Christ. Education can't do that. No, I reckon it can't. Well, Brother Sheffey, I expect we'll be there. I thank you for that, and I’d appreciate it if you'd invite your neighbors; we want to have a good crowd. Hey, mister! Hey! Did you pass an old woman on the trail? Who? Have you seen Aunt Sis, the midwife? No, I haven't seen anybody on the trail. She's supposed to be workin' round the mountain today; I’ve got to get her. Is somebody in your family sick? It's my sister; she's in bad labor-- real bad. You point me toward your house; I’ll go back there and do what I can. It's back yonder, the way I come; I’ll go this way. [girl screams] Oh, Mama! Can I go get her husband? [girl cries] Has he been sent for? She ain't got no husband. What we ought to do is call for all the girls in the county seat; [girl cries] maybe if they saw a little of the agony side of it, they'd do some different thinking. Perhaps so. But our dear Jesus is very near to us all when we're in agony of mind and body. Let's just make her as comfortable as we can. [girl screams] Oh, Mama. It won't be long now, child. [Mama] Aunt Sis is a coming. [Aunt Sis] Howdy, Brother Sheffey. [Sheffey] Aunt Sis. Well, I’d better get busy. You men folk be gone. Oh, Brother Sheffey, you better say a little prayer. They ain't comin' so easy today. I’ve lost one already. [boy] So you're Preacher Sheffey; I heard of you. And you knew my pa. What was the name again? Archie Tilton. I don't remember him. You ought to; I heard him talk of you plenty of time. He was a moonshiner, and he said you prayed against his still, and he said that after you prayed a big tree--as big around as a wagon wheel-- come dancin' down the mountain and landed smack dab on his still, and squashed it as a stepped-on chicken egg. The Lord be praised if your father changed his ways. Pa never made another drop of liquor after that. He's in heaven now, anyway. Son, would you go get my sheepskin off my saddle? I see the sunbeams comin' through that tree yonder like the very gates of heaven are open, and I want to pray. [baby cries] Is the girl all right? Oh, of course she is. Those young ones make a lot of noise, but they're as tough as pine knots. Mr. Sheffey. Mr. Sheffey. Mr. Sheffey, I . . . I know I’ve sinned, but will God forgive me, and use my son and not curse him? God's always merciful, and life's always a new beginning. Let's pray. This young sister has confessed her sin to me already. Thou canst take human mistakes, and glorify Thy name, though we must always bear the scars of our sins. Lord, we ask of Thee a mighty thing today. Take this little infant boy and make of him Thine advocate who'll stand in a hundred pulpits across this land and bring a thousand souls into Thy kingdom. Lord, Thy servant Sheffey would like to know before I join Thee in heaven, Thy plan for this little life. Amen. Not a bad crowd tonight either. It's been a good week. God has blessed our efforts. What do you think, Robert? How does it compare? It's up some over last year, but we've much work to be done. I can remember when we had as many people standing outside the shed as inside. We haven't done badly though. No, praise God, we've seen many souls trust the Lord. Well, somebody must think we're a success; we're having special visitors tonight. Two conference officials just came in. Well now, we must let neither the praise nor the censure of man divert our attention from God's Word. There's still much work to be done here tonight. Are you one of the preachers tonight, Brother Sheffey? No. I feel a great burden. I believe I’ll spend some time with the Lord during the preaching. But, Brother Sheffey, you should be on the platform where the folks can see you. [Sheffey] I’m going to pray that men and women will turn their eyes from the platform so they can look into their own hearts. [inaudible conversations] Hey, wait up! Brother Sheffey! [Sheffey] Hello, Opal. See how much he's grown? There you are, Brother Sheffey. You see, we're all here. Well, praise the Lord for that. Four other families from our church are here too. That's half our congregation. Well, thank you, dear friends, for your help. Hello, Mr. Sheffey. Hello, Eliza. God has blessed your meeting, and I’m thankful for you. Will there be another meeting, next year? Looks like there will be. And will you still be traveling around? Eliza, make haste. The service is starting. [Sheffey] I’ll still be traveling. [song leader] Brothers and sisters, let us open the service this evening with "How Firm a Foundation." ♪ How firm a foundation, Ye saints of the Lord, ♪ ♪ ls laid for your faith ln His excellent Word. ♪ ♪ What more can He say ♪ ♪ Than to you He hath said ♪ ♪ To you who for refuge To Jesus have fled. ♪ This evening my text is found in the gospel of John 3:14-16. "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the Son of Man be lifted up that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish but have eternal life. For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son should not perish but have everlasting life." Here are three glorious and grand truths of the Word of God I call to your attention. [preacher] Oh, my dearly beloved, can't you see that our Lord's words of salvation are simple? For just as the people of Israel looked in faith upon the serpent of brass and lived, so must we look upon our Lord Jesus Christ. The prophet Isaiah cried, "Look unto me all ye ends of the earth and be saved. For I am God and there is none else." There are many here tonight who are anxious about their souls. Delay no longer, but arise now and come to this altar, and receive Christ as your Savior. Come now, I beg you. [congregation sings] ♪ Come ye sinners, ♪ ♪ Poor and needy, ♪ ♪ Weak and wounded, ♪ ♪ Sick and sore; ♪ ♪ Jesus ready stands to save you, ♪ ♪ Full of pity, love, and power. ♪ ♪ I will arise and go to Jesus, ♪ ♪ He will embrace me in His arms; ♪ ♪ ln the arms of my dear Savior; ♪ ♪ O there are ten thousand charms. ♪ [preacher] "Come now, let us reason together, saith the Lord. Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow. Though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool." "Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn of me. For I am meek and lowly in heart, and you shall find rest unto your souls." [Sheffey] Welcome, sister. Wait, please. Our fellowship would be richly blessed if you would join us. I’d hardly fit in there. Is there anything on your heart? Of course not. I was just curious. I just came to see those people making fools of themselves. You can satisfy your curiosity better inside. In there? I’d be the laughingstock of the whole town. Will you come back again? I don't know. I’ll be praying for you. Save your prayers for them. Jesus died for your sins as well as theirs. Died? I’m not ready for death. Death to self is the first step to eternal life. Here, I give this to you. It's red and alive like I am. You'll have to get the faded white flower of death from somebody else. "Behold now is the day of salvation. Now is the accepted time." If the Spirit of God has made your soul anxious tonight, come now to this altar and receive Christ as your Savior. Time and again the Spirit of God has spoken to your heart, and maybe never again He'll call. Maybe tonight. This is the last hour. Come now, I beg you. Come now. Young man, has the Lord spoken to your heart tonight? I can't go down there; everybody would see me. Let's slip outside then. God will meet you anyplace. No, I couldn't. Right here. Right in your seat then. No. Don't tell me about it. I don't want to hear it. As you will. The Lord said, "Behold I stand at the door and knock." But you'll have to open the door and let Him come in. Next year, I promise. Next year, not now. [man behind Sheffey] Brother Sheffey, I need to be saved. [Sheffey] Amen. Amen. [Sheffey] You've seen what the Bible says, and you know what God has promised and what you have believed. Take my Bible. Hide God's Word in your heart. [other man] Thank you, Brother Sheffey. Thank you. [man on stage] Mr. Sheffey, might I have a word with you? Certainly. Something on your heart? No. I had something quite different to say to you. Do you know me? No . . . I . . . Well, I believe I do. I thought you would. I’ll come right to the point. Some years ago, I was compelled to turn down your request for a license. It was not my decision. I merely relayed it to you. But I agreed with it at the time. It appeared that you did. In short, Mr. Sheffey, I’ve come to tell you that it was a wrong decision. Your subsequent activities have indicated that you do indeed have an aptitude for your work. I have little natural aptitude, only God's calling. From what I’ve heard, you're largely responsible for the success of this camp meeting. Mr. Sheffey, I’ve come to offer you our official sanction. I heard you're the one that wanted to do away with these revival meetings. Not entirely, not quite correct. My concern since my recent election as the presiding elder of this district has been that time and money-- God's money, of course--not be wasted. But now that we have a big crowd, you want to get in on it. The world is changing. Now that the War Between the States is over, the whole country is opening up to new ideas. With better schools and education, I believe the camp meeting will diminish. You may be right, but I believe it'll grieve the Lord. It's progress. It's progress but in the wrong direction. I’ll continue to support the camp meetings, but I won't need your help to do so. You must realize that by refusing our support, you may actually be hastening the end of the very thing you sought to save. Is that your choice? Choice? It's no choice at all. As far as I can tell, you don't even believe the gospel I preach, but you tell me that by your support I can have bigger crowds and keep the camp meetings open longer. You want me to do something I believe is contrary to what the Bible commands. It's against the Scriptures, and against my conscience. I will not do it. Very well, Mr. Sheffey. I complimented your influence, but don't overestimate it. [Tyler Frazier] Robert, I was looking for you. Did you hear that? Yes, I heard. You were right, dead right. [Sheffey] Tyler, we've got to work harder than ever, that's all. You already cover more miles in a year than any three regular circuit-riding preachers I know. I mean, we've got to pray harder. That reminds me, I had the strangest experience tonight. I met a young woman hiding behind this tree, listening to the preaching. Well-to-do? She was dressed right fancy. You know her? Heard of her. I don't know her name, though. From some wealthy family. Preacher Maiden. [Maiden] Yes. Brother Bob talked with our mysterious visitor tonight. That poor girl; I feel sorry for her. She comes to the services quite often, but she never comes inside. She needs to be saved, and she knows it; but she's afraid she'll have to give up her social standing. A rich, young woman coming secretly by night. Reminds me of Nicodemus in the Book of John. Lady Nicodemus. Well, I hope I didn't scare Lady Nic away for good. [Maiden] I doubt that. There aren't many that can get away when you pray for them. Where are you headed on such a day, brother? Hunting for a job; heading down to the saw mill. If they don't hire me, guess we'll plumb starve to death this winter. You ought not to be out in this weather in clothes like that. Ain't got no others; no socks at all. Besides, it weren't as bad when I started. From here, saw mill's just as close as home. Hold on a minute. What are you doing? Taking off my socks. What for? For you, of course. My toes might well be froze as yours. My boots are better than yours; besides God will take care of my needs. I’ll be praying that you get your job. Much obliged. Much obliged. What's that noise outside? Papa. Hello! Who's there? Is that you, Brother Sheffey? Jimmy, quick! Jimmy, take care of Preacher Sheffey's horse. Oh, Mr. Sheffey. What happened? He must have got caught in a snow storm up in the mountain. Oh, must you ride in such weather? Face is all cut to pieces by the sleet. We weren't expecting you this time of year, Brother Sheffey. I was wondering how to get you the socks I knitted for you last week. Here they are. I hope you like indigo. Yes. Indigo will be fine. [Sheffey] I think a fair exchange is in order. Merry Christmas, Eliza. Oh, The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne. Wherever did you get it? Thank you, Robert. I often think that this home means to me what the home of Lazarus, Mary, and Martha meant to Jesus. That's a great compliment. I meant it to be. Eliza, how long have I known you and your family? Well, let's see. One summer you stopped by on your way to preach to a convict camp. And the next year you were off to convert all of West Virginia. Only the southern half. Then after that you were off to the Cumberland Gap and then . . . With a good many stops coming and going at my favorite place. Do you feel at home here? I feel at home with you. Eliza, I would be honored if . . . Robert, I . . . can't pretend this is a surprise. We both knew where our hearts have been leading us. The possibility has been discussed in this house. And? My parents are afraid that your constant travel would be a hardship for me. Eliza, what are your feelings? I’ll come to that. First, I wanted you to know how my family feels. They still believe in you and your work. Now Robert, what were you saying a minute ago? When? What? What were you going to ask me? I said, I would be honored if . . . if . . . Robert, are you asking me to marry you? I was. Then I accept. What? I accept. You do? Oh, yes. I’ll marry you. Well, you sure went around the cowshed about it. Robert, we're too old to fool ourselves. I love you, and I want to be with you. But I believe in you, too, and I want to help you in your work. God is good. I want you to continue your ministry just like before. I’ll travel less, Eliza; I’ll make a home for you. No, Robert. You follow God's calling and I’ll be content. I do love you. God is so good. Robert! Does Mrs. Sheffey live here? Indeed she does. We're not so sure about that Mr. Sheffey, though. It's good to be home, Eliza. Oh, you've been gone so long, Darling. I missed you. Where's Eddie? Eddie, where are you? Pa! In the apple tree. Pa! Hello. Hello, Eddie. Good to see you. Have you been a good boy? Have you been fishing lately? No, you want to go? I’d like to go. I’ve got something for you. Oh, good. And for your mother too. Gideon, let's see. The big one is for your mother. Oh, thank you, Darling. And the best one is for you. Thank you. And how have the meetings been? Oh, we had a wonderful revival. [Sheffey] Good meetings. These are all prayer requests. There's so many. There's more. Papa, I’ll make a list so you can remember them all. I’ll put these aside. I’ll get to them when I can. It will soon be time for me to ride the circuit to persuade people to come to the campground. You can't persuade everybody all by yourself. Eliza, if you don't support me, I don't know what I’ll do. Whatever God wants you to do, I’ll stand with you. I know you will; you're a pearl of precious worth. Do we know anybody named Beamer? [Mrs.Sheffey] Oh, that one. She sounds like she's in bad trouble. She sent a homemade map. She lives someplace called Bear Wallow in West Virginia. It's too far; it's dangerous. Robert, you're not listening to me. Yes, I am. You're telling me you don't want me to go because it's too far. And because it's dangerous. You don't know what kind of people are up there. They're people in need. They sent for me. Everybody sends for you. They think you're some kind of miracle worker. Well, if they do, I must go and disappoint them. Besides, I can introduce them to someone who can work a miracle in their lives. All right. But please, Darling, be careful. I will, Eliza. Who is it? [Sheffey] Are you Mrs. Beamer? Yeah. I'm Robert Sheffey. I had a letter . . . Oh, Brother Sheffey, I knowed you come. Mama said if I ever needed anybody for anything, you'd come. No matter what. I . . . can't take it no more. He's gonna kill me. And maybe the babies too. Your husband put those cuts and bruises all over you? Yes. He's not such a bad man when he's not drinking. Honest, he's not. And what do you want me to do? I don't know, Brother Sheffey. Where is he now? I don't know for sure. Out drinking. You can't talk to him when he's drinking. [drunken singing] He'll kill you if he catches you here. [Mr. Beamer] Woman, get my vittles. You be a hustling now or I’ll whip you again. He's out cold. He'll be like that for four or five hours, and then he'll wake up. And then he's sober? Then he starts drinking again. That's when he starts beating me. If I take his liquor, he'll kill me. We can't talk to him. We'll try something else. Brother Sheffey, why are you taking his clothes off? [Sheffey] There's no clothes in hell. Nothing to hide behind. In hell? What do you mean? You're not gonna . . . We're going to give your man a taste of hell-- for one night only. Oh. Please, don't hurt him. [Sheffey] You bring some fire from the stove. Oh, that liquor will sting him. Let's take him home. He'll do better. I know he will. Stand back, child. Oh. Huh. Huh. What? No! Oh, no. No! Ahhh! Oh, no. No. No. Nooo!! Help! No! Noooo!!! Uuh. He's all right. I’d better be on my way now. I’ll ride through the clearing and get shed of the evidence of our deed. What if he remembers? He'll never mention it to you. A man returning from hell won't care to talk about the experience. I think you're going to have a sober husband for a while. I’ll stop back later, Mrs. Beamer. The only thing that will cure him permanently is the gospel of Jesus Christ. If I can talk to him, maybe I can win him to the Lord. Thank you, Mr. Sheffey. ♪ How firm a foundation, ♪ ♪ Ye saints of the Lord, ♪ [continues humming song] What's the trouble, old boy? Surely my singing's not that bad. [Sheffey] What's this? What happened? Don't rightly know. My horse just dropped down like he was shot. I'm afraid he's a goner. Well now, we're not far from a town. You can buy another horse there. I ain't got but four dollars. You know of any four-dollar horses for sale? Don't lose faith now. God will provide if we trust Him. Let me talk to the Lord about it. [Sheffey] Dear Lord, would You require so much? There's no use praying. Go get your harness. What did you say? You'll need your harness to put on Gideon here. We ain't beggars. I told you I ain't got no money. You need no money. The Lord's laid it on my heart to do this for you. Take him for Jesus' sake. We'll pay you back somehow. Oh, no. God will supply my needs. Only . . . leave me alone with him a minute. Old friend, it's not what I want; it's what I must do. I won't forget how you've served me-- through the snow and across the miles. You've been a good friend. We'd kind of like to know who we're obliged to. I'm Robert Sheffey. So you're Brother Sheffey. Folks say what you pray for always comes to pass. Sometimes praying can be an excuse. The horse was already provided; there was nothing to pray for. God bless you. Be kind to him, and he'll give you good service. Feed him only good grain. And give him fresh limestone water. Bye, old friend. Why, Brother Sheffey, is that you? It's me. The sweet angels are not out today. How come you're walking, preacher? I gave Gideon away to a needy family. Can you loan me a horse to get home, Aurelius? [Aurelius] You know I will, Brother Sheffey. [man on porch] Hold on, now. I’ll pay for you a new Gideon. Just happens there's a horse auction tomorrow. Now ain't that a coincidence. [auctioneer] $50 once, $50 twice, sold to the man in the brown hat for $50. Bring on the next horse. Ain't that a dandy, boys? Look at those feet. Look at the conformation. Anyone would be proud to own this horse. [Nye Finley] That's the horse we need to buy for the preacher. Who'll start the bid? 65. 65 I got. Now who will give me 70? 75. 80. 82. 82 dollar bill now. 90. 90 I got. Would anybody go 95? Last time around. $90 once? $90 twice? $91. $91 then. $91 once, twice. Sold for $91 right over here. Hot diggity! There's your new horse, preacher. I won't waste any time or effort; I’ll call you Gideon. Bring my saddle and bridle. Just a minute preacher, these horses are fresh from the west. They've never been broken yet. We'll get along just fine. You can let him go. Move along, Gideon. Thank you, friends. You've been kind to God's servant. Come on. Giddyup, Gideon. Robert, Robert, it's Eliza, Darling. I'm here. [Aurelius] Brother Sheffey, can you hear me? I remember the stream. What happened? [Aurelius] Far as we can tell, your horse saved your life. Aurelius found you and brought you home. That was several days ago. Several days . . . I need to get back on the trail. No. The doctor says you won't be riding anywhere for a long time. You must rest now, Darling. [Sheffey] Toby, I appreciate your driving me all over creation while I’ve been sick. It's been a blessing to help you in your work, Brother Sheffey. I’ll be able to ride Gideon again soon. Whoa. [Eliza] Robert. Eliza. Did you have a good trip, Darling? Wonderful trip, Eliza. Oh, but look! Here we stand leaving poor Toby. Good day, Mrs. Sheffey. Toby, thank you. We'll see you again next week. Have you taken care of yourself, Robert Sheffey? I stayed with the Beamers. They took good care of me. Did you see Eddie this trip? Yes, and look at the new suit he gave me. That boy, he's going to spend all his money on us. Hello, Zeke. Oh, Darling. Eliza, I had a wonderful trip. That buggy's not as good as Gideon, but it was a great blessing to be able to visit the sick and help bear their burdens. Well, just remember, when you get Gideon back: no more than ten miles at a stretch. You haven't been on a horse for almost three years. When I get to heaven, I'm going to ask the Lord why he made a woman's head so hard. And he'll tell you it's to make up for your soft one. Hello, Brother Bob; you at home? That sounds like Tyler Frazier. But . . . what would bring him now? [Tyler Frazier] Hello, Brother Bob. [Sheffey] Hello, Brother Tyler. Eliza. Tyler come on in. Warm yourself by the fire. Tyler, you're here so soon. I wasn't looking for you until spring. I'm not ready to leave for the campground circuit yet. I'm afraid there won't be any need for that this year, Bob. The camp meeting's been closed. Closed? Robert. Why? What happened? Same old excuse-- not enough interest, new age. Tyler, they can't do this. We've got to do something. We'll open the meeting on our own. It's not that easy. Lots of problems-- very little public support, no official church sanction. That campground was built by people like us, people who believed in it. Surely they can't keep us from using it. Some would like to. At any rate, there'll be no meeting this year. It may take a few years, but we'll bring it back. We can do it. We must. Hi, Mr. Sheffey. Hi, Mr. Sheffey. Hi, Mr. Sheffey. [Frazier] lt isn't going to be the biggest crowd we've ever had, but it's not bad for a new beginning. From what I hear, the only reason there's a meeting at all is because of you and Brother Sheffey. I wonder if everything I’ve heard about him is true. Likely it is. I’ve never known his equal. He's like one of the mighty warriors of the faith in the book of Hebrews. Closer to God than most of us can even imagine. When will Brother Sheffey be arriving? Excuse me. What's going on there? What are you boys doing? Put those pipes out. We ain't hurting nothing. You're endangering a thousand people. Think what could happen if one of these wooden buildings caught fire. The whole place would be gone in a minute. Yeah, it might at that. Now, take those pipes off the premises. Brother Sheffey! Brother Sheffey! Brother Sheffey! Hello, boys and girls. Brother Bob, so glad to see you. I want you to meet Ed Bailey here. He's from the conference. Well, Mr. Bailey, I hope the conference hasn't sent you here to hinder our work. No, Brother Sheffey. I'm here on my own because I love the camp meetings, and I’ve heard what you've done for this one. Then we're glad to have you. We need all the help we can get. Mr. Sheffey? Mr. Sheffey. Yes? It's me, Mr. Sheffey. Ed Bailey. What is it? It's what you said about the conference. I apologize if I was abrupt. No, I . . . Well, you were, but you were right in what you said. I feel it myself. I guess that's why I’m here. You see the new attitudes creeping in among your leaders. It's so hard to understand. They pick the Bible apart; criticize everything I believe, and they do it so smoothly. I don't know what to think. Look. What are they trying to do? They want to call themselves Christians because it's respectable, but they try to tear down everything that Christianity has ever been based upon. They say that Christ is not the Son of God, but they try to support a religion that's based on this very fact. They claim that the Bible is only a human book, but everything they know about their religion is based on it. They claim to follow Christianity, and then deny everything that Christianity has ever taught. But on the other hand, there's so many other good men who still believe everything I believe. There are a good many, but they seem to have less and less influence. It's always the liberal attitudes that are attractive. You think I must make a choice. It will not be an easy choice. What about you? My choice is easy. . . . Or rather, it's already made. Years ago, when I was denied a preaching license, it was a great sorrow to me. But I determined to follow the leading of the Lord anyway. In these latter years I have come more and more to rejoice that I am not obligated. I do not have to choose between my loyalty to some organization and the Word of God. When you put it like that, it's not really much of a choice. Doesn't seem so to me. It's more a matter of courage. Brother Sheffey, will you pray for me? We didn't have as big a crowd as we'd hoped, but it's a start. We'll do better next year. Oh, I almost forgot. Here's your souvenir. What's that? It's from a friend of Robert's, Lady Nic. Did you talk to her? Nobody did this year, but she hasn't forgotten. What's this all about? Lady Nic is a woman who lives nearby from one of the finest families. She's been coming to the camp meetings off and on, long as I can remember. But she can't quite overcome this world for the sake of the next one. That rose-- she sends it to Robert every year as a symbol of her defiance. I still believe God's going to save her. Then she will send a white rose of surrender. See you, Brother Tyler. God bless you. [Mr. Bailey] See you, Mr. Frazier. We'll see you next year, Brother Sheffey. Where is that letter? How I do miss Eddie since he grew up and went away. Ah, here it is. "Dear Reverend Sheffey, I finally got your address from a peddler. Throughout my lifetime I’ve been told that many years ago you stood at my unmarried mother's bed and prayed for God to make a preacher of me and stand me in many pulpits across the land until I had brought a thousand souls into the kingdom. It is my joy to inform you that I have served churches from Tennessee to Texas, and up to the sixth of this month the total that I’ve led to the Lord came to 1000 converts. And it's signed, "Archibald "Archibald Tilton." Tilton." The sweet Lord manifests Himself in so many wonderful ways. Robert, hasn't the time come now when you can be a rocking chair preacher? You have no business riding all over creation. I have all the business in the world-- my sweet Lord's business. You're not getting younger, Darling. I don't feel any older, though. I feel like I’m as strong as ever. It was reopening the campground, Eliza. It gave me new life. It didn't give you a new body. They thought they could close it down. And now that it's started again, we'll keep it going. But we can't do it sitting around. You can't go like you used to. It's coming on winter soon now. You don't know how many times I’ve pictured you lying somewhere in a snowdrift and nobody finding you 'til spring. My dear Eliza, all right. All right. For your sake, I’ll take it slower this winter. [horseman] Brother Sheffey! Brother Sheffey! Brother Sheffey! Brother Sheffey, the campground, it's burning! Burning? The campground? Yes, sir, I just came from there. The whole thing's on fire. No, it can't be. Yes, sir, it is. You can see the smoke from the top of the hill. Go on, Toby, go to the top of the hill. See if you can see the fire. Yah, come on. Get. Yah. Robert, no. You've been sick. [Eliza] Robert, Robert, stop. There's nothing you can do to help. [Eliza] Robert. It's all on fire, Brother Sheffey. Robert! Come back! Ro . . . Ro . . . Look at the smoke. Let me take your horse. You bring mine. Tell Eliza not to worry about me. Rob . . . Ro . . . Mrs. Sheffey! Mrs. Sheffey! More. Quick. [Sheffey] Hold my horse. Oh, Brother Bob. I'm afraid it wasn't an accident. No one knows who, but somebody did it deliberately. Tyler, looks like we have our work cut out for us again. No, Robert, not again. lt can't be done. It can! I’ll do it myself . . . Alone if I have to! The doctor! Eliza! Eliza! Eliza! You better speak to her; she's sinking fast. Eliza . . . Eliza . . . I always thought I’d put you to rest first-- to be sure everything was all . . . all right. Eliza, I love you. [Sheffey sobs] Lord, how can it be? How have I failed you? What have I done wrong? Everything I’ve loved is gone. Have I been wrong? Is the world right? Oh, Lord. All gone. Everything. My dear Eliza. Lord, forgive these feet of clay. Forgive my pride. Forgive my trusting in my own strength. Forgive me. Brother Sheffey, Brother Sheffey, Brother Sheffey. That's what I’ve got to tell you. It was me that burned the campground. Oh, mercy. Oh, mercy. I thought it would help if I . . . But after all you told me, I’ve ruined everything for you. You could never forgive me. I forgave you long ago. My dear sweet Lord convicted my heart of pride and bitterness-- only then I didn't know who should receive my forgiveness. Now my joy and blessing are complete. Blessing? But the campground will never be rebuilt, will it? No. I used to think that it would be rebuilt. In fact, I thought I would do it, but that was only my own pride. My own pride. The campground is gone forever. God never forces His will on men. He calls them unto Himself, but if they will not follow Him then they have to go their own way. The campground is gone not because you burned it, but because God's people didn't want it, and God let them have their own way. Every time we give up a part of our faith to try to fit into the ways of the world, we lose it forever. We lose a precious part of God's promise. Sacrificed to the world, and the world will never give it back. And someday when the world tells us we can no longer have our religion except where they say, and God is driven from our schools and our government and our homes, then God's people can look back and know that our religion was not taken from us; it was given up, handed over bit by bit until there was nothing left. [preacher] "Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid. Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your Father which is in heaven." Beloved Sheffey, we bid thee not farewell but only for a little while good night. Thou shalt rise soon at the first dawn of the resurrection day of the redeemed. It is we who linger in the darkness. Thou art in God's own light. Our night too shall soon be past and with it all our weeping. Then with thine our song shall greet the morning of the day that knows no night. Then at his voice thou shalt spring from thy couch of earth fashioned like unto his glorious body. Until then, beloved, sleep. We praise God for thee and expect to praise God with thee. Amen.
