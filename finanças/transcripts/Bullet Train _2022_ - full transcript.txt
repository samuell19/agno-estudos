Thank you for taking the job on such short notice. I am ready. You are getting the new and improved me. Since I've been working with Barry, I am experiencing a calm like never before. Never. Like, I'm less reactive to situations, I'm more accepting of people's shortcomings. I was a little uncertain about coming back to work, but it's like Barry says: You put peace out in the world, you get peace back. I think your new therapist might be forgetting what you do for a living, little Ladybug. Ladybug? Mm-hmm. Your new operational name. Ladybug? Really? You don't like it? You like it? I like it. Well, if you like it, all right. Oh, I see what you're doing. Ladybugs are supposed to be lucky. Ha, ha. You don't have bad luck. Really? My bad luck is biblical. I'm not even trying to kill people and someone dies. That's an exaggeration. It is? My last job? The political blackmail photos? I voted for you. Remember the suicidal bellboy climbed to the roof of his hotel, couldn't take it anymore? Seems more like his bad luck than yours. Hang in there, buddy! And he didn't die. Okay? You drove him to the hospital. It's good luck. All in how you frame it. Sure. Gotta say I like it here. I could live here. I like the atmosphere, the people are considerate. Except for that guy. Why is this job paying so well? It was supposed to be Carver's, but he's got some stomach thing. Carver? You know, and he doesn't do snatch and grabs. I'm filling in for Carver? Y-You picked me second to Carver? You said you wanted simple for your first job back. Doesn't get simpler. Shit. Shit what? I think I must have lost the key when that guy bumped into me. What's the number again? Five twenty-three. Momomon. Carver. What an ego. I mean, talk about a candidate for self-improvement. I mean, calling in sick? I mean, what is that, high school? Mm. I can hear that personal growth. I know I'm being judgmental. I need to... work on that. But, Jesus, what a douche bag. You have the strangest requests... firecrackers? I'm industrious. Please tell me you didn't order the sleeping powder. Nope. You almost gave that bodyguard in Anchorage a heart attack. I've worked on the dosage. Take the gun. Hai. This train is bound for Kyoto. Hai. Domo. I'm gonna assume you didn't take the gun? Barry says every conflict is an opportunity for a peaceful... what was it? And your handler says some conflicts require a gun. Shit. Okay, I'm on. Well, that's a start. Hey, this is nice. Economy? You know, I'm thinking of starting my own agency. You know, all simple jobs, all the time. That's a terrible business plan. No more sociopaths, no more maniacs. Just quality people. Barry says it's time for some change. I think he's right. Barry does not know what you do for a living. Okay, here we go. The bullet train has 16 cars: ten economy, six first-class, and remember, only one minute stop at every station. Bloody fuckin' hell. Do you mind? What is he, fucking blind or something? Hey, hey, hey. Come on. Oh, come on, nicking...? No. You don't have to nick the biscuits, man. Oh, no. You all right? Okay, cool. Yeah. Fucking asshole. Thank you. Why'd I do that? It's like I got a compulsion or something. I have to take it if I see it. Need to talk to someone. Serious. A goldfish biscuit? I mean, I don't, I don't understand it. Okay, simple snatch and grab. What am I snatching and/or grabbing? A briefcase. Intel says there's a train sticker on the handle. Briefcases have owners. Owners are not simple. Mm-hmm. And last update says the owners will be in economy class. O-Owners, plural? Why didn't you tell me to bring that gun? I did. You chose spiritual enlightenment. Please. Ticket. Hold on. Ah, no, no. Receipt. Oh. Shit, I think I dropped my ticket, too. Uh, that receipt shows I bought a ticket, though, right? One stop. Yep. Domo a rig at...
