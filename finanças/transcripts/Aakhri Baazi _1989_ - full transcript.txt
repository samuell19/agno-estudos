You are distancing yourself from me! Sapna.... .....I am trapped so badly.... ...where light..... .....is also not helping me! Reason? Cobra Gang. I am assigned to catch them! No news about them? I know everything.... ....their meeting places.... ...who is their Chief! Why dont you arrest them? Sapna! -Yes! If a beloved.... ....sees his beloved cheating on him.... ....the one who was God for him.... ...how would he feel? He'll be really hurt. What should he do at that time? He should forget he ever loved her! And should be punished! And instead of the beloved..... ....would be his own mother? Even you dont have an answer right? A corpse lying at a Crematorium.... ...cannot burn its pyre! Sir, Laxman is dangerous for us.... .... he can even hang us! Laxman is my brother! He can never be dangerous for us! But since he is a police officer.... ...he can be dangerous! But dont forget one thing..... ....he my brother first..... ...and then a police officer! The law doesnt consider any relations! He is not even your real brother! Dont talk nonsense! What do you want to say? Just that.... ....you have made the rules of cobra Gang.... ...and you will only break it? What rules? If any police officer gets any news about our gang.... ....he should he killed! We should kill Laxman! I make rules! Only I have the rights to break it. Remember one thing... ....if you get such ideas... ....I will be your worst enemy I know you hate me! I wish... ...I could hate you. If not hate.... ...but you'll no longer like me the way you did! Yes. And so I melted... ...inspite of wearing my uniform! And I dont want... ...your uniform to turn into a shroud for you! Some people of my gang want to kill you! I dont know who and when can they do it! I suggest... .....get transferred somewhere else! And start a new life! I have started hating my life and my existence! Let them kill me! He has no rights to live... ....who cannot complete his duties... ....nor can pay his debts! It was my duty... ...to serve you! And by playing your duties.... ...you are stuck in a quagmire of sin Sin-Virtue... Good-bad.... ...the one holding the scales.... ....has always been unhappy! If you also want to judge me... ...then tie a black scarf like the goddess of Law So that you wont be able to see a single thing! Then will you be able to live a better life! Take some money! Will help you. You are buying me? Bribe? Sad. Prashant Kumar has never bribed anybody! He wants to give a new life to his brother! If you want to give me a new life.... .....you get yourself arrested! Now you are talking like an Inspector! So listen... Prashant Kumar can never bend in front of law! I am a looser! And I am not scared of death! Laxman... ......dont be stubborn.... ...and keep this money! Money, Money, Money! The money that you have earned sinfully... ...will be gunpowder someday! And later you'll only hear blasts! Take your money. I dont want your money! Take it. Instead of you if someone else would have done this... ....this would have been the last mistake of his life! Parvati.... ....you are back? What happen? Laxman has refused to leave this city! He refused? Why? Because he is an officer! He has started talking about playing duties, trust and conscience! He is paying back my favours by not arresting me! Why dint you make him understand? I thoroughly made him understand! But he dint want to understand! I even told him..... ...take this money.... ...get transferred! He told me.... ...you are trying to bribe me! Me? I'll bribe my brother? Have I ever differentiated between Ram and him? This is the fruit of our deeds! But Parvati... ...what is all this for? Say For whom? Had he seen my poverty... ....he wouldnt have dared to talk to me in this way! Anyway... ..he does what he wants! I will do my duty! I will protect him from all the dangers! And I'll call the advocate tomorrow I will transfer my entire... ....property to Ram! Laxman. Laxman. Laxman, where are you? Laxman. Where are you lost? Idiot! What is the matter? You seem to be very happy today. Not me. Call me with respect. I am not Ram anymore... ...I am Ram Kumar Sahab! Brother has made me a chairman of each of his companies! I am so lucky... ...I have a brother like him! Who was just a coolie... ...through his hardwork... ....honesty and truth.... ...has owned a huge empire! I havent seen God... ...but I think he would be my brother! Inadvertently, if someone assumes a person to be his God,.... ....his status doesnt change by that! What do you mean? What did you mean? Your brother has not earned through his hardwork, honesty and truth.... .....but has murdered many and has reached here! The companies you've become a chairman of.... ...was founded by taking hundred innocent lives! And that... ....hardworking coolie.... ....is still a coolie.... ...but the difference is.... ....now he doesnt carry luggage he carries the burden of sin! He is not God.... ...he is a smuggler, thief and a murderer! You abused the one.... ...who helped you? Why dint you turn speechless before saying this? Because... ....I dont tremble on speaking the truth! But becomes stronger! Ram... ....the help you are talking about.... ....that help has.... ...stopped me from my doing my duties! Else... ....my duty.... ....was to hang him! If this is true... ...my Godlike brother is a thief.... ...is a smuggler.... ...and he is a criminal.... ..I will chop his hands off! So he cant be a coolie of these sinful activities! And this is a lie Laxman.... .....Ram will be Ravaan for you! Remember! Ram What happen? What's the matter? No, Nothing. I think you are hiding something from me! Tell me what is the matter? No! I was thinking about my future! What? You are a rich man now.... ....I hope you dont distance yourself from me! You wont forget me! Is it possible? You will always stay with me! Here in my heart. How do I tell you Ram... .....the truth about Brother! You want to resign.... ....this is a pyre..... ....where lies a brave officer's deadbody! A police officerâ€¦. ...who had promised himself to... ....do his duties when he becomes an Inspector! To do my duty... ....I can sacrifice every drop of my blood! But.... But I am helpless! Helpless? What is it? Helplessness shouldn't come the way of your work For the sake of your duty..... ....a father sacrifices his son! For the sake of duty.... .....a wife sacrifices her husband! For the sake of duty.... ...a brother can even kill his brother! And such people.... ...become immortal in history! Come with me! This boy who is locked... ...his name is Deepak. He is famous in the world of smuggling, theft and robbery! Today.... ....he is imprisoned here for years! Do you know who is he? He is my son. You? My enemy is here? In search of death? Shakaal, the one who is in danger.... ....he himself finds life! You are foolish. Who has come to a person who can kill you. They are foolish... ...who doesnt make an enemy's enemy a friend! Meaning? P.K's brother... ...Inspector Laxman.... ....wants to hang us! And P.K.... Who can sacrifice you for his brother! Yes! Even he is my enemy! I'lll take a revenge of his slap by killing him! Then what are you waiting for? Shakaal will protect you! Kill them You'll not only be saved from getting hanged... ....but you'll also be the Chief of the Cobra Gang! Chief? -Yes! Chief of the Cobra Gang! This was always a dream! But such dreams only come true after killing many. Keep the cake here and flowers there! Make it quick. All preparations done? Everythingâ€™s fine? Yes! I am thinking on this auspicious occasion... ...lets get them engaged! Very good! Nice idea! On this occasion... ....nothing will be a better gift than this! I have got some news... ....Inspector Laxman is coming to arrest our gang! And even that... ....some man from our gang..... ..... is going to kill him at Diamond Harbour I wont let that happen! I wont let that happen! Parvati, you manage! I am just coming! Now reach Diamond Harbour with my men! Now Durjan will kill them! And I'll kill Durjan And later.... ...The reigning champ..... ...I'll be. I! Laxman Brother! Laxman! Why did you come give up on your life? Say! Why? Brother, you had told me one day... ...leave the city! I am leaving this world! I had not asked you to leave me for ever! You still have to live your life! It was good, if I would have died! But your death... Your death is my loss! I can never tolerate this loss! I can never tolerate this loss! The day... The day you'll leave doing all this... ...that day I'll again be alive! You gave me one life! Promise meâ€¦. Promise me you'll give me one more life! Promise me! Promise me! Take it there! Sister in law! What is the time? Its 7 already! Still brother has not come!
