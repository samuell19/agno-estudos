No one's throwing in the towel or even agreeing with that doctor's report. - Yeah, I know, I know. - I know it's not practical. - No. No, it's not. It's political. - Good. Keep your head up. - Why is he working so hard to hide it? - He doesn't have a choice. - Oh, I disagree. - How can you disagree? "There by the grace of God goes us"... that's what they're saying, as if our body is who we are. Well, it's not. Our soul is who we are. But they don't know that. - I wish he could just wheel himself out there in front of everybody. - Eloise, sweetheart, he can't do that; it's politics. - Yes, but he could use this opportunity... Perrini: When you get right down to it, it's not gonna matter if he hides his legs, as long as he doesn't hide what he knows. And what he knows is what it's like to be be one of us. - Good afternoon, picnickers. - Hiya, Doc. [Franklin gasps] Mahoney: Now wait. Just wait a moment and catch your breath. - Aw, damn. You all right, son? Elliott: Fine, pop. - You fell down. - Yes, I did, Daisy. 12th time today. Must be a new record. [laughter] Mahoney: You're just tired. You just overdid it, that's all. - [groaning] Roosevelt: And so America must find... America...America must be requir... America needs a pathfinder... - That's...that's good. - A blazer of the trail to the high road that will avoid... [sighs] That will avoid the bottomless morass... [sighs] - Well, what is it? What's wrong? - What if I fall trying to get to the podium? - If you fall, then you show them how to get up. - No, if I fall in front of thousands of people, I lose everything, but their pity. And they'll be writing my obituary before I can get up off the floor. - Elliott won't let you fall; he'll be there. All the arrangements have been made, boss. It'll be fine. - Who are we fooling? This will never work. It's a waste of time for me to place Al Smith's name in nomination. They'll never let me back into politics. They'll never see past my legs. - My darling, they'll never see past your legs, unless you do. [somber music] ♪ ♪ Franklin. - Don't worry, Doc, we're not coming with you.
