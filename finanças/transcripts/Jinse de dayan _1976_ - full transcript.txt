Shanghai Animation Film Studio The Golden Wild Goose papercut animation The story is set in the Tibetan region of my country and takes place in 1959, post-liberation. The Sargi Steppe is suffering a serious locust plague. Comrade Ba Sang! All I can see here is people trying to fight the locusts. People are quite enthusiastic about it. However, the locusts are truly raging. I agree. The plague is hard to deal with. It will be too late by the time the locusts grow wings. I've already sent Captain Kabu to the town hall for further plans. No matter how hard it is, we have the Party, and Chairman Mao's leadership. We can surely destroy the locusts! - Yes! - Come on. Good! ♪ In those distant times, ♪ Disaster struck on the vast grassland, ♪ Locusts were as cruel as herd owners ♪ the vast grassland ♪ is desolate ♪ Legend has it that from the East flew ♪ The Golden Goose ♪ Spring wind swept away all the pests ♪ Magical goose ♪ flying over the grassland ♪ Cows and sheep cheered happily. Flowers blossomed ♪ Ah - the Golden Goose. ♪ This beautiful story is being spread over the vast grassland. ♪ This beautiful story is being spread over the vast grassland. Huaerdan! It would be so good to have a chance to meet the Golden Goose! That is simply a myth. But maybe it's real? Let the Goose fly. Fly! And destroy all the locusts! Don't waste time talking about a golden goose. Even goddess Guanyin, with her thousand hands, is unable to stop the god-like locusts! God-like? I see they as pests! Dawa! No more loose talk! Offending the gods and Zen master Foye is no joke. Locust! Locust! Renqing thinks you're god-like. Show me your power then! Now the god-like insect can meet Foye (is dead). What are you laughing at? Anyway, it'll only be a few days until the locusts grow their wings. When that time comes, everywhere visible from here, will be dark and gloomy, with gusting wind. It will only take an instant, for the cattle and sheep, the tents and children here, all to be gone. Ha! You've gone too far. Renqing, from what you're saying, you think all our efforts will be in vain? Secretary Ba Sang, I only meant we shouldn't go against the gods' will. Gods and spirits! We don't believe in any of that. Right! Man's power is supreme. We newly liberated herdsmen do not believe in fate. - We believe in the power of Revolution! - Yes, yes, Secretary Ba Sang. Children! The Golden Goose is coming. The myth is about to come true! Really? The Golden Goose is coming?! Captain Kabu just came back from the town hall with some good news. Chairman Mao is so concerned about us Tibetan people that he has sent People's Liberation Army aeroplanes to spread pesticides to destroy locusts. So you can see that the Golden Goose really is coming! It's coming! It's coming! Uncle Ba Sang, since the aeroplanes are coming, what can we Red Scarf pioneers do? Ah! There's so much to do! Such as... building a temporary landing strip. and planting the signal flags! Signal flags? They tell the aeroplanes where to spread the pesticides. Secretary Ba Sang, this is such good news! We liberated herdsmen could not be happier! This grassland can finally be peaceful. No. Wolves don't close their eyes, and snakes are blocking the way. Children. Although we are victorious at the moment, those bloodsucking reactionary herdsmen will never give up. Wang Jin is the worst of them. You haven't caught him yet. Yes! We must take extra caution now, so that those bad guys can't even plot against us in their dreams. We must use our blood and souls to protect this socialist grassland. What? The Communist Party is sending areoplanes to fight the locusts? Really? Yes, it's true. They are about to build a temporary landing strip... Headman Wang Jin. Headman Wang Jin, I thought the locusts would eat the whole grassland. And the people would suffer. I did not expect the Party to send aeroplanes. Now even the locusts are of no help to us. My dear herd owner! Now only Zen master Foye can help us. Got it? That's difficult. Those nasty serfs do not believe in Foye. They only trust the Communist Party. No. It's not that simple. You need to use your status as liberated herdsman. Plus, we have Foye's power. We can use this to mislead the people. Right. If we mislead them, the landing strip cannot be built. And no aeroplanes will land. Within days, the locusts will grow wings. The locusts will cover the whole sky. Even the Party can do nothing about that. By that time, we'll be able to work together with our spies. Get our hands dirty. The Party will have no place on this grassland. - The world will be ours again. - Hahaha. Little Jiga! Little Jiga! Time to go. Coming. Little Jiga! Little Jiga! Come back! Grandma, what's wrong? You just said I could go. - Child! Come back. - Grandma! Grandma Jiga, let Little Jiga leave. We Red Scarf Pioneers' shouldn't lag behind in building the landing strip Huaerdan, the other comrades are already on their way. Let's hurry up! Dawa, wait for us! Let's go, Little Jiga. Why isn't Huaerdan here yet? He'd better be quick! Where did he go, anyway? Hey! What are you making a noise about? Wait till we remove this pole! That'll give you something to make a noise about! - Huaerdan is coming! - Huaerdan. Huaerdan. Huaerdan! Fellows, let's get to work! - Okay, give me that axe. - Give me that axe. Huaerdan! Huaerdan! Children, you mustn't do that! This pole is not to be axed. What should we do now? Grandma Jiga, what brings you here? Whatever it is, don't hurry. Grandma Jiga, rest here a while first. Take your time. Hurry up, everyone. Hurry up! Quick! Grandma, how are you? Are you all right? - What do you children know? - Get off me! Uncle Ba Sang said that all obstacles near the landing strip must be removed. With the pole there, the aeroplanes can't land safely. Children... I know all this. But this sacred pole protects the peace of our grasslands. This is the pole of the gods. Foye's spirit lives here. No one may touch it! What pole of the gods? It's only a piece of worthless wood and lies. - It's best to burn it as firewood! - Huaerdan... - Give the axe to me. - No. No. No. No. I won't. Grandma, are you all right today? I'm afraid Foye will be offended if the pole is taken down. Then our grasslands will be doomed. Grandma, who told you this? Everyone who lives here says so. Humph! It's you spreading the misinformation. Me...? What do the rest of you think about this? Say something! Am I really the one spreading misinformation? Isn't that what you were doing just now? I... Stop making fools of yourselves! Who's making fools of themselves? Let's make things clear! We're fighting the locusts, which you claimed to be godlike and can't be harmed. We're building the landing strip, which you do not like because of the pole. On top of that, you're using Foye's name to scare us. Aren't you just an alarmist? Huaerdan, don't forget that Foye is our ancestor. You are also a child of Foye. No! We are the children of Tibetan people. We are the Revolutionary Forces of liberated herdsmen! I'm telling you... stop that nonsense now! Comrades... chop it down! Huaerdan! Renqing - there! Folks! This pole of the gods is not to be taken down! Ten years ago, Huaerdan's father and Grandpa Jiga offended the spirit. Foye was angered, and the entire grassland suffered. Pooh! And now Huaerdan is going to repeat history! Renqing, what are you up to? I... I... Secretary Ba Sang... I... I'm just trying to consider everyone's well-being. Nonsense! You only came here after the liberation, so how do you know what happened 10 years ago? Er... I heard it from others. Oh! So you are very concerned about our grassland here. Uncle Ba Sang, Grandma Jiga said... Grandma Jiga. - You... - Secretary Ba Sang. Speak, Grandma Jiga. The golden sun will shine on the Sargi Steppe, and thousands of years of snow will melt away. Whenever I think of 10 years ago, it still frightens me. That year we really suffered a serious plague of locusts. Grandpa Jiga and Huaerdan's father fought the locusts with fire. We didn't intend it, but the pole caught fire. Headman Wang Jin insisted that they had offended god-like insects and thus Foye. I used the last drop of lard... to light a lamp for Foye. I prayed for my family. But... but... Grandma! Grandma, you respected Foye, protected the pole, used up all the oil, and shed all your tears. So why are so many people still suffering? Maybe it's because I didn't pray hard enough. No... Grandma Jiga. That plague 10 years ago, was due to the old society. Bad people in power. At that time, Wang Jin was in power. This Foye, and the gods' pole, those are all just shameless lies! The pole is no more than a poison planted by Wang Jin in our Sargi Steppe, a poisonous needle, piercing right through us. A poisonous needle? In the past, the headmen were in power. They made us work ourselves to the bone. And now the same strategy is being used again. Why's that? They crave power! We start having a good life, and they can't stand that. - You're right! - We do not accept their nonsense! - Chop the pole down! - Chop the pole down! Huaerdan, give grandma the axe. Grandma... you... - Let's do it. - Grandma! Come. Let's do it together! The Golden Goose is coming tomorrow. What should we Red Scarf Pioneers bring as welcome gifts? How about noodles fried with extra oil? - And some strong milk tea. - Grandma has already prepared this. How about offering ceremonial scarves to People's Liberation Army? - My grandpa has prepared those too. - So what shall we do now? The thing that best represents our Tibetan people's pure feelings is... ... the snow lotus high on the mountain! Snow lotus? Yes! Let's go, and pick some snow lotus! Huaerdan. Look! Those signal flags have been planted so tidily by us. Huaerdan. Look! It's a snow lotus. - It's a snow lotus! - The snow lotus is coming! Let's bring these snow lotuses over, once the Golden Goose is here. Yes, yes, yes! Huaerdan... what does the Golden Goose look like? It has a pair of spectacular wings, and flies all over the blue sky. - Can it see the entire grassland? - Yes. - Huaerdan, can it see Beijing from here? - Yes, it can. That's amazing! It would be so good if we could fly to Beijing on its back! And offer our lovely snow lotuses to Chairman Mao! ♪ Oh, the Golden Wild Goose. You fly faster. Fly faster. ♪ And fly over the snow mountain. ♪ Please bring our lovely snow lotuses with you. ♪ Our lovely snow lotuses. Offer them to the Beijing City that we love! Hello. ♪ Offer them to the Beijing City that we love! Hello. ♪ The Golden Wild Goose. ♪ You fly faster. Fly higher. Fly over that dense forest. ♪ And here we have arrived. ♪ We have arrived in Beijing. ♪ Beijing! Chairman Mao smiles at us. ♪ Hello, and how are you. Chairman Mao smiles at us. ♪ Hello, and how are you. How good it would be, if we could actually fly to Beijing. We surely can. The People's Liberation Army has sent its aeroplanes. Huaerdan! Why are our flags scattered around? Someone has sabotaged our work. Let's get down there immediately. You lot go back to help uncle Ba Sang. Dawa, you follow me. Little Jiga! Grandpa will be coming as well. Dawa. Look! It's Renqing. Why is he going into the forest? Something's not right. Let's go! The vultures see the other vultures fly. Bones piled up. One pile after another. Where there's food, there are people. And there's a cave. Let's have a look. Bah! Ah... - Huaerdan, I can't see anything at all. - Shush. Pooh! I cannot believe that a herd owner like you, would be so frightened, by a straw in the wind. That lowlife, Wang Jin! So this is where he's hiding! Renqing is a herd owner?! I'm afraid I've been exposed, and they will all come soon. Who taught you to act like this?! You should have been more careful. I hate them so much, headman Wang Jin! Humph! Hatred is not enough. Be ruthless! When will the Communists' aeroplane come? - Hmm? - Ten o'clock. Good. That gives us enough time. Come here. This is some good stuff the Commander gave us before he left. Time bomb? Yes. Once the aeroplane arrives, blow it up with this! - What? You want me to do it? - Surely you're not scared? My dear herd owner... what about your cattle and sheep there? Your serfs and land... don't you want all that? Oh, yes, yes, yes! We must take back what's ours! This bronze pot might be useful. I, Renqing, wish to present milk tea, on behalf of liberated serfs. Hooray! Renqing is plotting against us. Let's go back now to help uncle Ba Sang! Mm. Hey, Dawa!! - Someone's there! - Run! - Chase them! Seize them! - Don't let them get away. Huaerdan! Dawa! Run quickly! Quick! Quick! Why are Huaerdan and Dawa not back yet? I've already sent a few soldiers to find them. Ah. Mmm. Comrade Ba Sang. Renqing was seen going to the snow mountain early this morning. He's not back yet. Uncle Ba Sang. Uncle Ba Sang. The bronze pot... The bronze pot has a bomb in it! What? Hahaha. Remember me, serf? Eh? You damn money-hungry wolf. Shut up! If you keep following the Party, I'll blow you up, just like your father. Over my dead body! Wait and see. Your "Golden Goose" is about to crash. Phooey! You just wait! Uncle Ba Sang will bring you to justice sooner or later. I'll kill you now! Help has arrived! We must protect this vast socialist grassland, with our blood and souls. Huaerdan. What should I do now? You go watch cave entrance? Huaerdan! Dawa... we must protect this vast socialist grassland, with our blood and souls. Go back! Back inside the cave! Or I'll shoot you! You wouldn't dare! People are looking for you now. They're coming. Stay where you are. - Uncle Kabu! - Uncle Kabu! Huaerdan! Dawa! Renqing is taking a bomb to the landing strip. He's going to blow up the aeroplane. I must let them know. Good! Go quickly! Leave Wang Jin to us. Uncle! Isn't it difficult for you to come here, at your age? We've been waiting for the Golden Goose for years. How could I miss it? You're absolutely right. We all should be here. Brother Ba Sang. - Grandma Jiga! - Hello! Grandma Jiga... you are here as well. I want to welcome our People's Liberation Army! - Let me help you secure the cattle. - Thank you. Renqing. - Secretary Ba Sang. - You came. Being able to witness our People's Liberation Army, is also my wish, as a liberated serf. Oh. I did not know you cared about this. Where were you before? I... I did not go anywhere... - Is that so? - Comrade Ba Sang, telephone call. Oh. You're busy. Take your time. Uncle Ba Sang! Why haven't Huaerdan and his friend come back yet? Don't worry, Little Jiga. They will be back soon! Then... when will the Golden Goose be here? Hey! Listen! Golden Goose! It's the Golden Goose! Uncle Ba Sang! Stop right there! Bronze pot! There's a bomb in it! ♪ Warm sunshine on the frontier ♪ Liberated serfs are happy ♪ Chairman Mao's leadership gives us happiness ♪ Golden geese fly over the vast sweeping grassland ♪ Gallop forward on horseback A new generation is growing ♪ Follow the leader Chairman Mao, Follow the great Communist Party ♪ Follow the leader Chairman Mao, ♪ Follow the great Communist Party!
