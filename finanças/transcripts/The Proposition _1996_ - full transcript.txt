(MultiCom jingle) (dramatic music) (kids shouting) - Get over here! Catch them. Come here! - Get off me. (shouting) - Come on. - Get off me, mate. Let me go. - I need a drink, come on. Ellis, stay there. - Oh come on, gentlemen, I could do with a drink. This is thirsty work. (dramatic chords) - Press gang? - So? - They're young. - Army still pays the same. - Drink? (sighing) (thuds) (lively music playing) - Well, what are you waiting for? - Come on, run! Let's go, let's go! (shouting) (punching and yelling) (intense music) - Whoa. (horse neighs) - Stupid fools, what do you think you're doing? - Elen. - I wouldn't, Jenner. - Arrest them, take them away. - Are you all right? - Yes, thank you. (clicks) Walk on. - My God, Rhys, look at you. You're an embarrassment. (coughing) - Sam, Sam wait. - Terrible business, this war. Napoleon's got a lot to answer for. Oh, you brought them in then. Very nice, Mrs. Morgan, very nice. Five pounds perhaps? (sighs) - Five pounds? - Take it or leave it. - That one's not included. Let's go home. - Mrs. Morgan. (carriage rattling) - Sheriff's here, mum. - See to the horses, Evan. - Yes, ma'am. - Tom. - Catherine. I'm sorry about what happened in town. Rhys has become ... - An embarrassment? You could make things easier for him. He doesn't cease to exist just because your father's dead. - Really, well when was the last time you invited him to dinner? - When was the last time I invited anyone to dinner? He's your brother. - My bastard brother. I'm not his keeper. Forget about Rhys. Harry's death has left you with problems enough of your own. I didn't say anything in town, but, his creditors are talking about a forced sale. - But Harry died fighting. (sad music) They can't just take my farm. - They can, and they will. Gambling debts are gambling debts. They don't care how he died. Look, let me lend you the money. All right, let me buy the cattle. Pride is a fine thing, Catherine, but you're running out of time. And you don't have any choice. (sighing) - I can't, Huw. - Think about it. I'll call again later this week. (dramatic music) - Well, did you tell him you'd marry him? - No, I didn't. - He's a powerful man, Miss Catherine, he's not going to wait forever. - I know that. - Then what are you waiting for? You can sell every painting in this house, but sooner or later, there will be no food on the table and no roof over your head. What are you going to do then? - I'll think of something. One loveless marriage is enough. - There are plenty of worse things than a loveless marriage. And you'd be a damn sight better off than most. You can't run this farm on your own. - Can't I? (whistling) (owl hooting) (drunken singing) - Well, well, well. What have we got? Mrs. Morgan, what are you doing down here? - I, um, ... Your door was open. - So? - So I came in. - I can see that. - I have a proposition. - Really? - A business proposition. I want you to drive my cattle down to Gloucester. - I don't do drives anymore. - I thought you might if I explained. - Well, you thought wrong. Why should I drive cattle I don't own across land I can't own? And why Gloucester? Why not sell your cattle to Huw? Like everyone else. - I can't do that. - Really? I thought you'd have him eating out of your hand by now. What's the matter? Huw's hand not good enough for you? - I shouldn't have come. - Well maybe I'll take the offer. - But? - You wouldn't pay my price. - How much? - Well now, some men like a girl who is pretty in the face. Some men want a girl who's slender on the waist. But give me a girl who will wriggle and will twist at the bottom of the belly lies the cuckoo's nest. - You really do belong in the gutter, don't you, Rhys? - It's getting very crowded down here, Mrs. Morgan. (door slamming) What are you looking at? - He's bought the cattle then? - Rhys, why? - I saw Mrs. Morgan leaving his house the other night, that's all. - Something on your mind, Charles? - No, no. - Good. (men mumbling to one another) - It's going to happen to us, isn't it? We're going to be evicted. - Your mother won't let that happen. - Oh won't she? And what's she going to do? We've nothing left to sell. - She'll think of something. - I'm not a child, Evan, I know what's going on! - Well I'll think of something! - Not much left, is there? - Huw? - I'm sorry. - You're evicting me? - Catherine, I'm the law around here. I have to uphold it. - Don't let them take our things. - You go see Mrs. Abbott, right now. Right now. (stomping) When? - You have about a month. - I see. - Is this French? (sorrowful music) - Leave that alone. - There is another way. - That's not the answer. - I'm offering you a way out. In a month, you'll be out on the street with two young girls. Is that really what you want? - I think you'd better leave. (dramatic music) Get out! Get out. Get out! Get out, all of you! Get out, this is still my house! - Life with me, it really wouldn't be that bad. - Damn you, Harry. (crashes) (music swells) Oh, come here, I'm sorry. (cattle mooing) - (mumbles), this is? - No, she's clear. - Nice evening, Miss Catherine. - Is it? I don't want to sell them to Huw. Who else could I sell them to, Tom? - The Army, maybe. If we could get then down south, that is. - So let's take them then. - We've got no drovers. - Oh yes, we have. Rhys Williams, he's a drover. - He's a womanizer and a drunk, Miss Catherine. - I don't care, Tom. - Well, he might have been a gentlemen when his father was alive, but I wouldn't go hiring him now. All he'll do is pull you down with him. - With this much at stake, Tom, I'd hire the devil himself if I had to. (dramatic music) - I don't want your money. - Then what? - You really mean to go through with this? - Not much of a choice. Huw's haw for life, or you, once. Which would you choose? Do we have a deal or not? I'll be ready in three days. (horse galloping) - It's been a good year, Rhys. - What do you want, Huw? - Stay away from Catherine Morgan. - Catherine, she'd make a man of you all right, Huw. - Don't play games with me, Rhys. I'm not a little boy anymore. - Of course, you're not. You're the Sheriff. - That's right, I'm the Sheriff. And if you don't want to lose more than you've lost already, you'd best stay away from her. - Like you said, it's been a good year. I've no plans to go anywhere except down to the tavern for a drink. Welcome to join me if you like. Please yourself. (soft dramatic music) (people laughing) (shouting) - Fire, fire! Rhys Williams, at your place! (suspenseful music) - Will he come? - He'll be here. - He's here! - I told you. You're late. - I had things to do. Where are my drovers? - We're your drovers. - You've got to be joking. - I said I'd get you drovers. I got you drovers. We made a deal. - Not this kind of deal, we didn't. I have bad luck enough without taking women on a drive, believe you me. - There are no men. They're all on the road. We're at war. - Old drunk. - Well that's it, we're on our own then. Come on. - How many we got? - About 200. - Now let's get things straight here and now. I give the orders around here. Not you, not Mother Evans, and not some snot-nosed know-it-all boy. You need me to get your cattle to where they're going. 'Cause as sure as I'm going to hell, not one of you knows how. Understood? - Yes. - Move them out. (slow adventurous music) (livelier music) (children shouting) - [Rhys] Well, Mrs. Morgan. You did well today. - Sorry to disappoint you. - Oh, there's still time. - How long? - Hmm? - To get to Gloucester, how long? - Two weeks, maybe a month. We can't use the regular routes, thanks to you. And I want to avoid the towns, because they're riddled with disease. Something wrong? - No. I didn't realize it would take so long, that's all. - What'd you expect? We've got a bunch of old men, women, and children, and 200 head of cattle. You haven't thought this through, have you? - I don't have a lot of choice. - Well there's always choice. - Oh, like the one I made? - It was your proposition, not mine. - Don't worry, you'll be paid. - Damned right, I will. (whistling) (knocking) - Where's Mrs. Morgan? Cat got your tongue? Where is she? - Gone. - Gone? Gone where? - On the drive. - Drive, what drive? What drive? With who? Was it my brother? Was it? (snoring) - Damn you, he's drunk. - Told you. - I don't need any I-told-you-so's from you. Get the cattle moving, I'm not waiting any longer. We're leaving. (snores) (cattle mooing) (gentle music) (children singing) (coughing) - Well well, Jenner. Comfortable? (spits) Don't push me, Jenner. I'm in no mood. I've got a job for you. I think it's something you'll enjoy. Release them. - What have you done? - What does it look like? - But you look like a boy. - Well it's man's work. - Does your mother know? - I don't have to ask my mother's permission for everything. - Move on. (thumps) (cow mooing) - Come on, come on. Are you all right? You've got to learn, come on. Bring up the wagon. Get across, hurry! - Mr. Williams, Mr. Williams. - Not now, Emily. - Are you mad at me? - No, I am not mad at you. - Are you mad at my mother? - Not now, Emily. - My father died. - Well, so did mine. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry, Em. You want to ride up front with me? - Yeah. - You sure? Come on, ups, I gotcha. Do you want to drive when we get across? Good girl. (splashing) (cattle mooing) (children yelling) - We're not very good at this, are we? - You are. - I been looking after cattle all my life. Except for the war. - Why did you go? - I didn't want to. No one does. That's why the press scandals and stuff. - Well, someone's got to stop Napoleon. - Well that's really gentry speaking, that is. - What do you mean? - The aristocracy keeping its head. That's what this war's really about. People like me getting blown apart, dying in France, when we should be back home taking care of things. - Evan. - Well, look what's happening to your mother. It's not right. Things are going to change. I'll tell you that. - Do you think so? (suspenseful music) (horses galloping) (majestic music) (fire crackling) - Whoa, ho, ho. (thunder rolling) - Damn him. We haven't got time for this. - I want a word with you, come and help me with this cow. Hold her head. I was watching you today. I've been watching you ever since you came back from the war. - Yeah? - You're paid to work with the cattle, so don't you go letting me down. - Letting you down? - Miss Elen, leave her be. Come on, lift her head. - Oh, I see, I'm not good enough for her, is that it? - She's a lady. So don't you go filling her head with your crazy ideas. Don't you go messing up her future for her. (soft singing) (dramatic music) - Don't push that leg, son, ride when you need to. - I can do whatever you can, and I don't need a drink to do it either. - Guess that makes you just about perfect, doesn't it? There's still a long way to go, Mrs. Morgan. Make this straight. - [Catherine] Keep going, push! - [Rhys] Keep it straight. (shouting) - Pull, pull! Heave, heave! (dramatic music) - Drovers, women? (lighthearted music) (cattle mooing) (men laughing) - Shoo, shoo. (mysterious chords) (chains clanking) - Whoa. We'll spend the night here. - Why are we stopping? - Because I said so. Owen. - Rhys Williams. - Glad to camp here tonight? - Yeah. - I've got to go into town. Catch you later. - I don't know what your problem with Jenner is, Rhys. This drive is more important. - It's not Jenner, Miss Catherine. He needs a drink. - Shut your mouth. - You want to try that again now that I'm ready? - Lesson in life, trust no one. - Stop it, he's just a boy and a crip. I mean. - I know what you mean. A cripple, yeah? - Leave it. It's me you're angry with, not her. - You make me sick. All of you. - How could you be so cruel? - Elen. - Put them in the field. You really handled that well. - Oh you, you really are. You're going to go get drunk, aren't you? - No. - I don't believe you. - Believe what you like. I don't care what you believe. (metal clanking) (dramatic music) - Rhys. - It's been a long time. - Usual? - No, just some food and some water, please. (drums beating) - Are we (mumbles)? - You'll see, Jenner's got something that'll keep him quiet. - Whiskey and another beer. Have one on me. - I'm not drinking, Jenner. - We could let bygones be bygones. That's up to you. - Oh Evan. - Seen enough, or do you want a closer look? - Don't talk to me like that, Evan, you just sound foolish. - You sound like your mother. - Well, sometimes she's right. I brought you some biscuits. - I think it's getting worse. - Does it hurt? - Sometimes. Sometimes. - Sorry. - Do you think I'm going to lose it? (sighs) - I'll get some padding. You'll be more comfortable. (suspenseful drum beating) (suspenseful chords) - What is it? - What do you want? - Shh, don't do anything stupid, boy. We don't want to hurt anybody, now, do we? - Jenner (gasps). (crashing and shouting) (screaming) - Aren't you the first? I said you was mine. (gun firing) - Let her go. I said, let her go. You too. - There's an awful lot of us. Only the one of you. - That may be, Jenner. But I've got a shot left in this pistol, and it's not pointing at me. Kind of makes us even. - Steady, Rhys, you're gonna miss. - Your drug didn't work, did it, Jenner? Don't. (clanging) - Out, get out! - You heard what she said, out! - We'll be back. - I'll be waiting. (crying) - It's gonna be all right. You're drunk! - Did you expect anything different? - No, I didn't expect anything different. You're a drunk, and you'll always be a drunk. - And you, you are a selfish woman, Catherine Morgan. I warned you about this drive. But you just care about you, and what you want. And to hell with the rest of us. - Is that what you really think? - Well what do you want, Catherine? What do you really want? (dramatic music) - You all right? - Yeah. - You know, I quite like it short. Now that I'm used to it. I'm very proud of you, Elen. When everything else starts to fade, remember that, won't you? Now get some rest. - How is she? - She's resting. Rhys, I ... About tonight, I. - Sorry, Catherine. I tried to keep them away. I just did what I thought was best. - I know, that's what we're all trying to do. - Want some? It's just water. You were pretty good with that frying pan in the fight. (laughing) (rooster calling) - Safe journey, Rhys. - What happened? - Stupid bitch. Almost broke my knee. (laughing) - Catherine did this? - Don't worry, Jenner, next time you can have her when I'm finished with her. She won't be so uppity then. (laughing) (gun firing) (shouting and splashing) - All I asked you to do was stop the herd. Is that too much to ask? - No. - Then get it done. Bury him, if you can find him. - He's off his head. - Yeah. But he's got his coming. (piano music) (men greeting one another) - I thought you'd be out chasing Frenchies, not foxes. - Same thing. - The French run faster. (laughing) - You know Captain Wilkes? - Richard. - Huw, surprised you're not in uniform. Not like you to miss a good party. - I prefer my parties a little smaller and closer to home. - So what brings you here, Huw? - I'm running a herd down to Gloucester. They'll be here shortly. I thought perhaps I could graze them here a few days. - Absolutely, have your drovers put them round the back. Join us, I'll let Sarah know to expect you for dinner as well. - Really, Colonel, there's no need. - Oh nonsense, I insist. - Excellent. - [Unison] Death before dishonor. (horn calling) (hounds barking) (flute playing) (clapping) (ominous music) - I never thanked you, not properly. - Oh sure, the cripple got beat up. - Stop that. - Inside, I'm still whole, you know? I'm still the same person. Really. - Evan. It's bad enough other people expect too little of you. Don't you do it too, hmm? - Don't worry, I won't let Elen fall in love with me. - What? - Tom. He says that Elen should marry a gentleman. - Oh, he does, does he? Well you can tell Tom, Elen will choose who she marries. Right now, what she needs is a friend. Now eat your breakfast, you. (ominous music) (music picking up momentum) (gun firing) - Clear the camp! Get out now! (screaming) - Emily! Emily! Bring her over here. (dramatic music) - Under here. Move, come here. - Are you hurt? Are you all right? Elen? - You all right? - [Catherine] Elen!? - Evan. - Jenner! - Elen, Elen, where are you? - Is the horse okay? - Have you seen Elen? - Clear this mess up. - Tom! - Oh, Elen. - Evan, find Tom. - Yes. - I'll get your cattle back. - Hold his head! Rhys! You'll be all right, Tom. You'll be all right. - You take the wagon. We've got to get some help. - What about the cattle? - Damn the cattle. - Hold on, Tom. - Whoa, whoa. - Tell Lady Sarah Catherine Morgan would appreciate a moment of her time. Do it. - I hope you're right about this. - There is nowhere else to go. Easy, Tom, easy. - You shouldn't have gone to all this trouble, Miss Catherine. I didn't fight. - I'll look after you, dear. Oh, Sarah, I'm terribly sorry to come crashing in here like this, but our stock man's been hurt, and we. - Take him inside. Send someone for the surgeon. - Thank you, Sarah, we had nowhere else to go. - Rhys, look after her. - This is Rhys Williams, my drover. - Ah. - Lady Sarah. You have some cattle in your lower paddock. Do you know where your husband bought them? - Oh, they're not his. They're Huw Williams', your brother's. - Sarah, they're my cattle. I don't know what Huw's told you, but they're my cattle. - Oh, I see. I think you should wait and talk to the Colonel, don't you? - No! - Please. He'll be back soon, so will Huw, stay. And you, too, Mr. Williams. Stay for dinner. Catherine, Mr. Williams. Well you'll both need to change. Let the servants know what you need. Right, well, I'll see you both at dinner. - Thank you. Huw sent Jenner. - Looks like it. - This is all my fault. - No it isn't. You're not the first person to come between Huw and I. If you're so worried about your farm, why didn't you just marry him? - I made that mistake once already. I married my husband for security. He gambled it all away. When he died, I didn't care. I felt nothing. And that scared me. (dramatic music) I'm scared. - Oh, I could use a drink. Catherine, you look stunning, come. Help me fix this. I haven't dressed like this in years. Father used to take Huw and I to the parties, his heir and his bastard. We both hated it. - You look wonderful. - What's the matter, you're trembling. Don't be afraid. We'll handle this together. What is it? - There's something I have to tell you. It was my fault. I brought this on us. I don't know what I was thinking. I didn't think that Huw would send Jenner. I thought that you wouldn't take me unless you really needed the money. But I needed you, Rhys. - What are you talking about? - I was the one that burnt your haystack. - What? - I was going to pay for it. (dramatic music) - Like you paid for the drive? Well, consider me paid. - Rhys, I. Rhys, please, just let me explain. It's not what I meant. Rhys, please. - I'll finish the drive. You spare me the tears. - Ah, here they are now. - Ah, Catherine, you look wonderful, my dear. - Thank you, Colonel Griffiths. - Rhys, welcome to my home. Sarah, why don't you get Rhys a drink. - Of course, Mr. Williams, this way. A drink, Mr. Williams. It's so nice to meet Huw's brother at last. I knew your father very well. He was a lovely man. I used. - Excuse me. - I don't want to interfere, my lady, but you shouldn't quarrel with Huw. I'm sure he's only trying to help. Huw may be headstrong, but he is one of us. Rhys is, uh ... - What? Unacceptable? - You're in danger of losing everyone's sympathy, my dear. - Catherine. (slapping) (punching) (Catherine cries out) - What's going on? (punching) - Stop it! - [Sarah] Stop, for God's sake, stop! - I think you'd better leave. - You never belonged here. - This isn't over. - Get out. (cackling) - What's happening. - [Elen] What did they say to you, mother? - Where's the cattle? - Are you all right? - What'd they say to you? - What took you so long? - What happened? - Huw has the cattle. - How's Tom? - Doctor said he'd be fine. - What happens now? - We're going to steal them back. - What? - We are going on. - We are? - I can't undo what I've done. (women making a small commotion) (fire crackling) (suspenseful music) - Jenner. (thuds) Good night. (whistles) (cattle mooing) - I can hear them! - [Elen] Come on, keep moving! Come on! (splashing) Come on, keep moving! - [Rhys] Stay with me! - She'll be fine. - Hold onto her, Rhys. - Elen, oh Elen! (whips) - I don't need this. We're leaving. (majestic music) - Rhys, can I talk to you a moment? - I'm busy right now. - The others can handle it. - Later, the rains are coming. Evan, secure the pens. (thunder crashing) What is it between you and Elen? - Nothing. - Nothing? Be careful of nothing. - Are you hungry? - Yeah. - I cooked you some food. (chuckles) - Go on. She's a lucky girl. (dramatic music) - Here. We've almost made it. - Tom would be proud of us, wouldn't he? (thunder crashes) - What happens now? - Well. Tomorrow we sell the cows and go home. - That's not what I meant. (gentle music) (fire crackling) - I have nothing to offer you, Elen. Less if I lose this leg. - We'll be fine, you and me. (suspenseful music) - First the cattle. - You can't just keep ignoring me like this. - What more do you want from me, Catherine? Tomorrow we'll be in Gloucester. You'll go your way, I'll go mine. - I'm sorry for what I've done. But I am not the same person now. And it's you who've given that to me. I love you. And I will always love you. No matter where you go. - But can I trust you? (sorrowful music) Hey Sam, hey Sam. - I'm gonna kill you, you bastard! (intense music) (shouting) - What was that? - Rhys! (dramatic chords) (shouts) - Huw, Huw? - Rhys! - Huw, get out of here. (punching) (shouting) - You're a fool for saving me, Rhys. Just know and remember. (punching) - Rhys, get them! - Help me, we've got to get them out of there. - Now what have I told you? - You're my brother. - Get up and fight me! - [Rhys] Don't do this. - [Huw] I warned you. Stay away from her! - Help me, we've got to get them out of there. (suspenseful drumming) Just let them out, now! - Rhys! - No, Huw! - [Rhys] Huw, don't do this. Don't be a fool. It's me you want. Shoot me, kill me. - [Catherine] No, Rhys! - If I can't have her, nobody can! - She loves me. (yelping) (gun firing) - Come on, quick. (groaning and yelling) - Rhys, Rhys? Oh, Rhys, Rhys, oh. (crying) - Catherine. - Ma'am, they're ready for us in Gloucester. Shall I move them out? - [Rhys] Come on, Em. I have a proposition for you. - A business proposition? (rolling pastoral music) (MultiCom jingle)
