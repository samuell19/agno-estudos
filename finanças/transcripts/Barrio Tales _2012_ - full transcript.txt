Why do you care? I don't know. I used to have a friend in the taco business. He made the best tacos north of barrio. Yeah, well, who doesn't make tacos in this fuckin' town? That is very funny. You don't mind if i eat, do you? Go ahead. Sure. Mmm. Fresh tacos. So good. You know, my friend tio who used to make the tacos, he had the best seasoning. Just muy perfecto. They say it was the, uh, secret ingredient. Tio's tacos is now open for lunch. Guys. Guys. Guys, wait up for me, man. I'm trying to read you this story. We can hear you from here, oggy. And i don't need you spittin' on me, man. Okay. Okay, listen, guys, this is important. "Four teenagers have gone missing in the last two weeks. "Evidence suggests that the county sherriff's department "suggests that these cases are all part of and connected to a serial kidnapping." Dude, why are you always reading depressing shit like this? I mean, can't you just enjoy the summer like a normal human being? Oh, okay. You want me to live like a normal human being? Okay, so basically what you're saying is for me to live my life, you know, go to the beach, have a good time, put on some sunscreen, build a slip 'n slide, you know, have the best summer of my life and pretend like nothing-- nothing's going on. Oh, and if i get kidnapped, yeah, that's just, like, supposed to happen, 'cause that's the way the world works, right? If you got kidnapped, the napper would be so bored and tired and annoyed with you that he'd have you back before dinner. Hey, uncle tio, what's happening, man? Hey, tyrone. How are you, bro? I'm good. How you doing? Good, man. You ready for round two? Oh, your tacos are killer, bro. All right. What do you want? Tres asada. Three asada. Coming right up. Nice. You're gonna like these ones. Oh, yeah? Extra special just for you. That so? On the house, brother. Oh. On the house? On the house. Órale, man. Thanks, brother. Now go fix those potholes for me. Always, man. Take care, huh? Me and my homeys were in the mgm grand, and tony hawk came by-- yo, baby, you like tacos? Fuck you. You like tacos. True. What's up, guys? Hey, tio. What's up, man? What's going on? What's wrong with him? Oggy's scared he's gonna get kidnapped. Like anyone even wants him. You kids are funny. So what can i do for you? Um, i'll take a number one, no beans, no rice, just the guacamole. Okay. And, chad, i already know what you want. Two tacos, carne asada, extra meat. You know it. All right. What about you, oggy? Oh, i'm not-- i'm not hungry. What? You telling me you don't want my tacos? Well, i-i'm sorry, tio. It's just-- i'm on a mission. Planning on stopping the kidnappings? Well--well, at least try. I mean--i mean, the cops aren't doing anything. Well, let me know if you need my help. Okay? Let me get those tacos for you. Don't forget the guacamole. I will not forget the guacamole. It's already ready to go. Nice day today, huh? Yeah. I always say it's a great day for tacos. Definitely. Cheers. All right. Bye, tio. Are you going to stop eating every time something bad like this happens. Like the time you heard about chelsea's older brother elton... oh. Dying in the bathroom? You thought you were gonna go blind for the next six months. Hey. Hey, that's a legitimate fear, okay? You don't play around with that. You don't touch that, okay? He had 20/20 vision before that, and then suddenly he couldn't see, okay? All right, oggy. For sure. Hey, guys. Hey. How do you like my tacos today? A little spicier. New recipe? I added a little something extra. Okay. I'll tell you my secret if you help me prepare for tomorrow's lunch. Why? Where's hector? Hector... oh, hector. He went back to barrio. So any takers? I got soccer tonight, man. My mom's making me dinner before she leaves town tomorrow. Well, tio, i-i can help you. I mean, i'm free, so... great. On one condition. Yeah. What? You can't tell anyone my secret, including these two. Come on. Come on, tio. All right, you got a deal. All right? Deal. Thank you. See you soon, okay? All right, bye, tio. Take care of yourself. Bye, tio. Bye. Hey, dude, have you seen oggy? I don't know. He's your friend. I haven't talked to him since last night. He probably got his penis stuck in an anthill again. That's ridiculous. Yeah, so can we get something to eat? I've got the munchies. Thank you. Who's the freak show? That's my brother les. He's staying with me while my mom's away. What is wrong with him? I have no idea. Tio! Tio! Tio! Hey, kids, what's up? S-sorry, tio. Um, we just thought you might have had some more tacos for us. Uh, you okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah, i'm fine. I'm fine. Just, uh, workin' hard, you know? Aren't you closed? Yeah, yeah, i'm closed, but i'm just finishing up some things. You know, i'm getting ready to go. I'm tired. I'm real tired. Okay? See you guys. Uh... what about the tacos? Yeah, i'll get 'em for you. Oh, hey, tio, uh, have you seen oggy? Uh, yeah, last time i saw him, he was with, uh, you guys having lunch. Didn't he help you with the new recipe last night? Yeah, yeah, yeah, i-i haven't seen him since then. Oh, okay. Mm-hmm. All right. See you later. You guys take care. That was weird. I saw blood on his shoes. Chad, he's a chef. But it looked new. Where's your skateboard? Oh, shit. Be right back. Tio? Yeah. Hello, chad. Well, hey, tio. My skateboard? Thanks. Take care of yourself. Okay, dude, there's just no way you're right about this. I swear to good, mims. Chad, are you sure? Yes, i-i saw his glasses with a crack right down the frame. Okay, chad, but it's tio. I mean, how can we accuse uncle tio of being the kidnapper? Kidnapper? He's a fucking murderer. I-i think i know what happened to hector. Yeah, me, too. He moved back to barrio. No, mims, he got hacked up into little pieces by uncle tio. Les! Les! Les! Les! What the fuck, yo?! Don't turn that shit off! Les, it's important. Okay, i told you not to bother me when i'm working on my whip, meem. Okay, that's-- that's sacred time. Okay, les, have you seen oggy by any chance? The little freak with the glasses? Yes. That wears the high-up backpack and the mad scientist haircut? Yes. The type of dude who's gonna shoot up a school in three to five years? Yes. No, i don't think i've seen him. Les, are you sure? I'm as sure as this north valley high c.t.f. championship ring, so, yeah, i'm pretty fuckin' sure. Oh, did you grab me some of those tacos? No. Tio was too busy hacking up oggy. What the fuck is this little shit talking about? Chad swears he saw oggy's glasses bloody and broken in tio's truck. Yeah, right, okay, uncle tio-- uncle tio wouldn't hurt a fly. He's like the town saint, okay? He might as well be my real uncle. No, les, there's something wrong with tio, and it has something to do with all those kids that are disappearing. No, no, there's nothing wrong with uncle tio, okay? The only thing that's wrong with uncle tio-- he's a kind-hearted mexican man who's been serving this community for many years, okay? Javi! Hey. What's up, brother? What--listen, not now, les. Please. Enough of the sandbox conspiracy theories, okay? Scoot your boot. Les! Scoot your boot! Your sister, dude. You got what i need? You mean a hit? I fuckin' need more than a hit. Let's do it. Don't touch it. Don't fuckin' touch it. Chilly. Go away, you stupid cat. Are you sure this shit isn't laced, man? It's making me feel kinda funky. Uh, no, homey. I got it from some crackhead from el barrio. I told some kids that i got it from some celeb dealer, so i charged them, like, twice the price. You're a badass motherfucker, javi. Who the fuck is that back there, dude? Dude, relax. That's that taco guy. Oh, it's uncle tio. What a weird dude. You bit your fuckin' tongue when you talk about uncle tio, okay? He's a good man. Jeez, man, take it easy. You know what? I'm fuckin' sick of people prejudging uncle tio before they give him a shot, okay? He's got a big heart and makes a mean motherfuckin' taco. Les, i didn't mean it like that. Yeah, well, it hurt my feelings. I wonder what he's doing out so fuckin' late at night, man. Maybe he's open late nights. Whoa, really? You think so? Oh, but it's like fuckin' 3:45 in the morning. That--that's too late. That--that's weird. So go find out. And bring us back some tacos. You think so? You think he would give us some? Yeah. Yeah. Tacos would be good. So i'm gonna do it. Yeah. Here, you take that. Just don't--don't smoke the rest of that, okay? No, no. Don't fuckin' smoke my shit. Hey, bring back some h-o-t sauce. Puto. Tio! Tio? Tio, dude, you-- you okay? Fuck. I'm coming to save you, tio! Fuck! Fuck, man. What the... tio's tacos are people. Tio's tacos are people. Tio's tacos are fucking people! Les? Les? Who you tryin' to get crazy with, ese? Don't you know i'm loco? Les? Les! Les, it's him. Les, open the door, please! "Mimi, i hope you've enjoyed your family and friends "for the last few years. "Your brother helped me make this for you. Uncle tio." Shit, shit, what do i do? Where's my bat? Where's my bat? Where's-- aah! You can't beat me. You're just a stupid-ass little girl. I've been doing this my whole culinary life. And human flesh... oh, it just tastes better. Hunting people is so much more intimate than hunting animals, because we're so much easier to catch! This mole sauce? It's your brother. You're fuckin' crazy. Fuck you, you little bitch! You love my tacos. I'm uncle tio, remember? That's right. Dude, come on, man. That's disgusting. Man up, kyle.

Stop being a pussy, dude. You ate some fuckin' bad tacos. Boohoo. Listen, i know you're fucking with us, man. And i'm starting to think pedro's not gonna show up. So what the fuck is going on? Relax. Relax. We're in the middle of nowhere. It takes time to get out here. Not all of us have cars like you. Sometimes our shit breaks down. Don't be so jumpy. There are a lot of wild animals around here. This is just a coyote. Not like it's a monster or anything. But who's to say what a monster is? Maybe a monster to me is not a monster to you. And maybe a monster to you is not a monster to me. Or maybe a monster to me is somebody who kills his own kind. I'm talking about... human-on-human killing. Hmm. What if i were to kill one of you, no explanation necessary, just cold-blooded murder? Hmm. They say a monster still lurks in this very area in search for vengeance. He was once the most feared mexican killer there was. He killed everything that stepped in his path till one day some mexicans killed his family and thought they'd slain the monster himself. But every night i can still hear the groans of his suffering and the thirst for his revenge. ♪ Getting too close, better pull on back ♪ ♪ sucker punches, need a one-two ♪ ♪ when you're talkin' on the telephone ♪ ♪ you don't m-m-m-m-m-m-mumble ♪ ♪ you got business, need to follow through ♪ ♪ yeah buenos dias, amigos.
