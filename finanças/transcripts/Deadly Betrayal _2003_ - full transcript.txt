[EAGLE SCREAMING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [BOTH MOANING] [PANTING] [WOMAN MOANING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [MOANING CONTINUES] WOMAN: Oh, yeah. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. [MOANING RAPIDLY] You didn't really think you'd get away with it, did you? You and the little stud set me up from the start. But this is where it ends. When the police get here, you're gonna get everything you deserve. And the whole world's gonna know exactly what a rotten piece of work you... [GUNSHOT] [CHOKING] [PANTING] [CHILDREN PLAYING] Have you seen my boots?Under the bed. Okay. What? It's not like I have a choice in the matter. Just gonna miss Melinda's science exhibit. She's gonna be disappointed... Again. Well, Melinda is a big girl now. She can handle it. Used to be days. Now it's months. Well, this time it's only two weeks. I'll be back before you know it. [CAR HORN HONKING] [SIGHS] That's the cab. Oh! [GRUNTS] DONNA: Whoa, are you okay?Dammit! God! I thought I fixed that thing. Listen, I'll call you when I get there. From the middle of the Sahara? Donna. [GRUNTS] Jeff? You are... Hey! You are gonna be back by the 24th, right? Oh, nice. It is our anniversary. Listen, don't worry. I'll be back on time, I promise. Okay. [BOTH SIGHING] Give Melinda a hug for me, will you? Mmm-hmm.I love you. [CAR HORN HONKS] Gotta go. [DOOR CLOSES] [SIGHS] Two weeks! Wasn't he away for two weeks, two weeks ago? [SIGHING] Uh-huh. I figured out in the past year he's been gone close to six months. [SCOFFS] I resent it, Roz. You know, I'm tired. I'm tired of being mother, father, cook, chauffeur. [LAUGHING] Get off it, Donna! What? You've been crying on my shoulder for months about how you and Jeff are drifting apart. About, about how you're doing all the work, and he's always away. Gee, what happened to my marriage? When did it all turn? [EXHALES] Donna! I'm sorry. I don't mean to hurt you. It's just... You know, back in college I never would have guessed that you would've been the type of girl to fall for that "stand by your man" crap. What is that supposed to mean? Well, it's like you said. Look at your life. Meanwhile, Jeff's off covering another story. He's searching for another headline, and you keep the home fires burning. What ever happened to that girl who was gonna go to New York and set the town on fire? Who was gonna be the top editor at the top publishing house, and brunch at the Russian Tea Room with the latest literati? She fell in love. [SCHOOL BELL RINGING] [CAR HORNS HONKING] [CHILDREN PLAYING] Just because your marriage ended like that. Yeah, it's because my marriage ended the way it did that I'm talking to you like this. Okay? Shannon honey, come. Hi, Mrs. Cooper!Hi, Melinda. Hi, Mom.DONNA: Hi, sweetheart. Hi, Roz.ROZ: Hi, cutie. MELINDA: Mom, did you hear what happened to the Coopers? No. What? Put your seatbelt on. Shannon just told me. They were robbed. DONNA: Really?ROZ: Aie, aie, aie. Who is that? [CHILDREN LAUGHING] That's Mr. Hamilton. My teacher. Your teacher? Mmm. Is he married? How should I know? I'd really like to polish his apple. Roz![LAUGHING] What? Gross! ROZ: You don't even know what that means. Mmm? Mrs. Randal? Hi!Hi! I'm Melinda's teacher, Adam Hamilton. Oh, hi, Mr. Hamilton. Donna, Donna Randal. Listen, I just wanted to tell you how much I enjoy having Melinda in my class. She's one of my best students. Aw!You know, she's smart, she's creative. [MUSIC PLAYING OVER STEREO] Of course, she does get a little carried away sometimes. Well, that's Melinda. I'll try to dial her down a little. No, no. No, she challenges me. I wouldn't do anything to dampen her spirit. Kind of keeps me on my toes. [CLEARS THROAT] Oh, uh, my friend Rosalind. Oh, call me Roz.Oh, call me Adam. Oh, you can call me anytime. [LAUGHS] I'd say, it would take the entire fire department to dampen her spirit. Yeah, but I'd bet it'd be a very happy fire department. Oh, yeah, you got that right. [LAUGHS] Listen, it was very nice, meeting both of you. It's nice to meet you, too. See you later. Bye.Bye. DONNA: Okay.ROZ: Yeah. DONNA: What is the matter with you?[CAR ENGINE STARTS] That's it![SIGHS] This one's nice. Mom, no! I hate that stupid sweater. And anyway, I've had it for, like, a gazillion years. [IMITATING MELINDA] Okay, like, what's wrong with this one? [SCOFFS] Melinda![PHONE RINGS] Oh! Thank God! [RINGING CONTINUES] Hello? Hi. DONNA: [OVER PHONE] Hey. It's nice to hear your voice. Who is it?It's your father. [GASPS] Daddy! Daddy, tell Mommy to get me a new sweater for Robin's birthday party. I can't wait for you to come home tomorrow. I miss you. I miss you too, sweetheart. Can I talk to Mom now? Alone, please. MELINDA: But, Dad...I promise... I promise, we'll talk about the sweater. Okay. Let me have a minute. Go on. Yeah. Listen, uh... Something's come up. You're not coming home, are you? Bill Greer broke his leg. They want me to go to Bosnia in his place. Things are really heating up there... Can you just tell them, no? Tell them to get somebody else. Oh, come on. It's our anniversary! What about the cabin that I reserved at the lake? Or the concert tickets for Friday night? Well, you can find someone to go to the concert with you. I mean, take Mel. She'll love it! No, she won't. Then, take Roz. [INHALES] You volunteered, didn't you? I can't believe you're doing this, Jeff! You've barely even seen us for the past two years. I want you on that plane tomorrow. I really don't have time for this right now. You never have the time. Unless, you count the time we argue. Maybe that's because you don't listen. You don't hear me, Donna. What I do is important! We used to be important. Dammit, Donna! You still are. I just... I can't have this conversation, right now! What is this really about, Jeff? Huh? 'Cause you need your space? Time to think? Figure out what you really wanna do with your life? Donna, don't. Go to hell! Oh, come here, sweetheart. Come here. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I... [SIGHS] I know I got angry with Daddy. I just... I just want him to come home. Hey! Hey! Don't you worry, everything's gonna be fine. Okay? All right? Let's dry those pretty eyes. [SCHOOL BELL RINGS] [BLOWS WHISTLE] TEACHER: Go, guys. Come on, let's go! [WHISTLE BLOWS] Let's go! Let's go! Penny for your thoughts. Oh. Big time problems, huh? Quarter? Inflation? You having trouble at home? Mom and Dad don't understand you? Your mom and dad are having problems? My dad's not coming home. He's gonna miss my science fair. And Mom's gotta go to a stupid concert on Friday night all by herself. Hey! It's not so bad. I mean, it's not like they're getting divorced, or anything. Your dad has just been delayed. Hey. Everything's gonna be all right. They wouldn't get a divorce, would they? No, no. They'd have to be very mad at each other. Mom sounded pretty mad. [CASH REGISTER RINGING] ROZ: Enjoy. Oh, my God, did you see her? One more face lift, and her smile will be on her forehead. By the way, did I tell you, I've decided to have a sex change operation? I figured, since I can't find a man, I might as well become one. How did I know she wasn't listening to me? Hello?Huh? Oh, I'm sorry, I was miles away. [PHONE RINGING] Rosalind's Books. Happy holidays. Oh, hi. Yeah. Yeah, just hold on. [WHISPERING] Donna. It's Adam Hamilton. Melinda's teacher? Hello? Donna, I was wondering if we could get together and talk. It's regarding Melinda. Is something wrong? Well, I don't think it's anything to get too concerned over. I just don't think we should get into it over the phone. I was hoping you'll meet me here in my class room. Oh, yeah. I can be there in 20 minutes. Great! I'll see you then. Okay, thanks. A midday tete-a-tete? It's about Melinda, Roz. Well, I hope she's okay but, you know, I think Mr. Super Stud's got a little bit more on his mind than Melinda. Don't be ridiculous. Oh, tell me you didn't see the way he looked at you the other day. You know, I've hardly ever seen you so flustered. What? You're crazy.Yeah, right! I'm a married woman, remember? So? Never hurts to look. Bye, Roz! Good luck. Hi!Hi! Glad you could make it. Uh, please, have a seat. So, what's... What's going on? I'm concerned with Melinda's recent behavior. She's, uh, not participating in class, she's distracted. I'd even say sad. She also told me about you and your husband. What did she tell you? Well, just there are problems. She's afraid you might be divorcing. Oh, my God! Look, uh, Donna... I realize this is none of my business, but I just... Thank you, Mr. Hamilton. Adam. Adam. I'll have a talk with Melinda. Look, um, if there's anything I can do to help. Please, just let me know. All right. You changed your hair? Well, it was up when we first met. Now it's down. It's... It's very nice. Thank you. Thanks. DONNA: Dinner's almost ready. I'm not hungry. I think we need to have a little talk. [SIGHS] I know you're worried about me and Daddy. I don't want you and Daddy to get a divorce. We are not getting a divorce. Daddy and I have been having some disagreements. It happens. All parents have them every now and then. It's not my fault, is it? 'Cause I'll be good... Of course, it's not your fault. This is nothing to do with you. It is strictly between your father and me. Hey. We both love you more than anything in the whole world and nothing's ever gonna change that. We just have some things that we need to work out. And we will. Okay? Okay.Okay. I've got something for you. I'll be right back. Ta-da! What's this?I don't know. Open it. It's the one you liked from the mall, isn't it? Mom, it's... It's perfect! Aw, I'm glad you like it. Can I have a kiss? You're hungry now? Yeah. Good. Let's eat. [PIANO PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] ADAM: Donna? Hi.Hi. How are you?I'm good, good. Nice to see you. It's nice to see you, too! Another music lover.Yeah. You know, Chopin's Nocturnes, and Brahms are two of my favorites. Mine as well. So, where you seated? Down there, in the orchestra. Oh, lucky you. I'm up in nosebleed country. But, that's okay. It's good acoustics. So, where's your husband? 'Cause I'd like to meet him. Oh, he's, uh, out of town. Oh, that's too bad. Yeah. So, I take it you're here with Melinda? No, it's not exactly MTV. [DONNA CHUCKLES] [BELL DINGING]Oh! I think they're trying to tell us something. Well, maybe I'll see you later.Hmm. Enjoy the rest of the concert.Thank you. Adam? [PIANO PLAYING] Well, sometimes I think that Chopin's music is just too personal. Intense, you know? Raw. Well, he was madly in love with one of the greatest French writers of the time. George Sand.That's right! Yes, apparently, she used to write furiously... BOTH: Under the piano. While he practiced. Yeah. [BOTH LAUGHING] Thank you, you made this a more enjoyable evening. Well, thank you. Look, um, I'm famished. Would you, uh... Would you consider joining me for diner this evening? Uh...I'll give Melinda less homework. Or, I'll give her more. I mean, whichever you prefer because, well... I mean, clearly, I'd pretty much do anything not to have to dine alone. So, please, don't... Don't say no. So, I hear you're the Alex Trebek of Dalton Academy. Oh, my Jeopardysessions! Mmm-hmm.Hmm. Yeah, we play games. You know, like, uh, Wheel of Fortuneand Concentrationand, uh... I mean, learning should be fun, right? Absolutely. And, uh, I try to do my best. And you do a very good job. Melinda really likes you.Thank you. WAITER: Are you ready to order? Oh! DONNA: That's an unusual watch. Oh, thank you. Yeah, I've had that a long time. I have eaten here several times before and I can tell you, that the ahi is amazing. Sounds good to me. Great! Ahi it is. Uh, make that rare for me. Same, please. Are you always this easy? [LAUGHING] Uh, when it comes to food. Ah. Well, here is to good times... ...and good friends. [GLASSES CLINKING] You know, I'm kind of surprised you've never been here before. I mean, given that it's so charming and romantic. Given your taste of music I would've thought that, uh, you and your husband would have... My husband and I don't eat out very often. He travels a lot. So, his time at home is really important to him. He's a cameraman for National News Network. Oh, wow! Well, I'm sure he cherishes the times that he has with you. I guess it's safe to assume that you like to read. I mean, seeing as you work in a bookstore. Oh, I help Roz out. But, yes, I do love to read. So what's your favorite? Austen? Bronte? Wuthering Heightswould be on my top 10 list, yeah.Mmm-hmm. Yeah, I always kind of felt that, uh, Heathcliff and Catherine spoke to my wife, Emily, and I. You're married? Yeah, I was. My wife was killed in a car accident, five years ago. I think I was very lucky to have her in my life. You wanna know what I really miss most, though? The little things. Things we used to do together all the time. You know, you're very, very lucky to have someone to share that with. This was a great evening. It was great music and great food. Of course, the company wasn't so bad either. Well, the food was good. [CHUCKLES] I know, I shouldn't say this, but I don't want this night to end. Oh, Adam. [CHUCKLES] I've gotta go home. I'll make sure you get home safely. I am fine to drive. Thank you. [SIGHS] You shouldn't have followed me. You can't come in. Goodnight. [SIGHS] [WHISPERING] Stop. You've gotta go. I know. Hey. Goodnight.Goodnight. [CHUCKLES] [CASH REGISTER RINGING] All right. Your change and your books. Thank you so much, sir. Happy Holidays. ROZ: Lunch! DONNA: Ooh!Yummy, yummy! Let's see. For Miss never-gains-an-ounce.Yes? Cheeseburger. Fries. Chocolate shake.Ooh. So politically incorrect. And for moi, our lady of the ever expanding thighs... Oh, stop it!Rabbit food. [LAUGHS] So... I didn't get a chance to ask you this morning, how was the concert? Oh, it was glorious. I loved it. I, uh, bumped into Adam Hamilton. Oh! Now I really wish I'd made it. Oh, I bet you do.Yeah, so that explains it. Explains what? The way you've seemed distracted all morning. And you have that certain look that women get when they've been perhaps naughty. Nothing happened.Uh-huh. Bulls eye! I hate to be right when I don't wanna be right! Nothing happened!Uh-huh? Hearty appetite, I see. So, how was it? Whoa! You'd better slow down, girl. People can get hurt. People you don't wanna hurt. What are you getting at? Well, you don't know jack about this Adam guy? Yeah. Look, Donna, I'm not making any judgments here. You're a big girl. All I'm saying is I could do Super Teach, go home and wash my hair and not give it a second thought. Can you? If there was something...[PHONE RINGING] Rosalind's Books. Happy Holidays. [CLEARS THROAT] Hello! ADAM: Donna? So, when can I see you again? Thank you, for your concern. You can't talk, can you? How's tonight? Uh, my place. Mmm. I've noticed that too. Oh, good. I'm glad you noticed. I just, uh, I thought it would be more private. You know, less chance of anyone seeing us. I tell you what, I'll make dinner. 'Cause I make a pretty mean scampi, you know? Thank you. I really appreciate you calling. You're very welcome. Well, seems like Melinda is doing better in school. Oh, great! You must be pleased. Mmm. [DOORBELL RINGS] [INTERCOM BUZZING] [KNIFE CHOPPING] Hello? ADAM: I'm in the kitchen. Mmm, something smells delicious. ADAM: Yeah. It's my mean scampi. Would you like some wine? No, thank you. Oh! What a great kitchen. Yeah, not bad on a teacher's salary, huh? Ah, my family had money. You have great taste.Thank you. [SIGHS] And I love these cabinets. Yeah, I built these myself.Really? Yeah, it used to be a motorbike shop. You know, it was a bit of a mess when I got it, but had great potential. I wanna give you the grand tour, okay?Okay. This where I work out. And I bought those bikes when I purchased the place. This is great! Here, I'll take that.Thanks. Why don't I show you the upstairs? Okay. It's right here.Yeah. So, how long have you had this place for? Couple of years. It took me that long to renovate the place. I'm not surprised. Oh! What an incredible space. Thank you. Uh, make yourself at home. I'll be right back.Okay. You like champagne? Yeah. [MOANS] [KISSING] [ADAM EXHALES] Oh! [SIGHS] [DISHES CLATTERING] Hey! Where you going? Oh! It's late. I've gotta go pick Melinda up. I'm sorry. DONNA: You tired? Hmm? No? Have you said thank you, to Roz? Thank you, Roz! You're welcome, sweetie.Oops! Wrong way. [ROZ CHUCKLES]Thanks, Roz. No problem. Okay. JEFF: Hi![GASPS] Oh, my... [CHUCKLES] What are you doing here? Well, I live here. Remember? [SCOFFS] I've been on a plane for 14 hours. And, uh, I thought you would be glad... ...to see me. I would have liked to have heard from you. Are you dropping off your laundry, on the way to your next appointment with history? Donna! [FAUCET RUNNING] I'm home for good. [WATER STOPS] What did you say? I said, I'm home for good. No more foreign assignments. I've asked for a permanent station here and they gave it to me. Are you serious? I'm dead serious. What's going on? We were in a small village, a couple of hundred miles from Sarajevo. I was shooting video for Lou, Lou Tirelli. [SIGHING] Suddenly, shells started raining down around us, like hail stones. We were right in the middle of it. There was buildings falling, bodies flying through the air, there was fire everywhere, it was an inferno. I saw families torn apart, you know. Lou and I, we just... We ran as fast as we could. Lou didn't make it. Oh, I'm sorry. Lou and I have been together since, I don't know... Forever. And all I could think about was you and Mel, and... I love you so much and I'll never do that to you and Mel again. [SIGHS] Daddy? Daddy, you're home!Hi, baby. [LAUGHING] Oh, I missed you so much! [INHALES] Just look at you. [EXHALES] I love you. So you missed me, huh? Did you, huh?[GIGGLING] Did you miss me? Come on.[STAIR BANGING] God, I'm surprised you guys haven't killed yourselves on this thing, yet. Well, now that your home, Daddy, you can fix it. Sweetheart, now that I'm home, I plan to fix a lot of things for good. Give us a kiss. Aw. Come on. DONNA: Root beer floats! [DOORBELL RINGING] Who's that? MELINDA: Mr. Hamilton? What are you doing here? Mr. Hamilton?I'm Melinda's teacher. I'm Jeff, Jeff Randal. Pleased to meet you. Come on in. ADAM: I was in the neighborhood. I thought I'd just drop by and see how Melinda's doing. Well, Melinda, sweetheart, you wanna go to the freezer and grab us some ice cream? We'll be right there.Yeah, okay. Is there a problem? No, no, there's no problem. Thank you, for your concern. Everything's fine. If you'll excuse me, I didn't realize it was quite so late. Uh, Melinda, I'll see you in class! MELINDA: Okay! Good night.Yeah, good night. Guy's got nothing better to do with his nights? What's going on, Donna? [SCOFFS] What do you mean, "What's going on?" Melinda had a tough time with you being away. Seems like, she took it to school with her. He's just concerned. That's all. Okay, well, now that I'm home, there shouldn't be anymore problems, right? Shouldn't be. [EXHALES] It feels like a long time, since I've held you like this. Hmm. I'm sorry, Donna. I'm sorry for everything. Donna! I wanted to call, but with Jeff...Adam. Let me talk.Okay. Uh, well, it's about what happened between us. I was vulnerable and I made a big mistake. [SIGHS] If things were different... How can you say that after the last two nights? Hmm? You know you want me. I'm in love with my husband. And I really want my marriage to work. I'm sorry. Stop it.Oh. You're afraid of me, aren't you? You're afraid of how I make you feel. You need to be touched. To feel the way that I can make you feel.Stop it! I don't want you to call me. And I don't want you to try to see me again. I'm sorry. [DOOR OPENING] [SIGHS] I guess he didn't take it too well. Oh, Roz, it was awful. What was I thinking? [SIGHING] How did I let all this happen? Look, this is a lesson learned. You got to put it behind you. It's over. It's done. Christmas stocks came in this morning. So, let's get back to work. And here's a thought. What shall Roz get her new possible soulmate, one Roland "Sweetheart" Sheridan for Christmas? Ronald "Sweetheart" Sheridan. "Sweetheart?" Oh, I'm thinking ahead! But, while you were gone, he came, he saw, he bought the complete works of Milton and then he conquered my heart. I mean, I thought I was the last of the Milton lovers. Anyway, we've got our next date on Thursday. Hmm. Well, at least the two of you span the same centuries. Hey. You know it's gonna be okay. Yeah. SALESMAN: Thank you, very much. $20 will do it. Do you like this one?Yeah, I think so. JEFF: You guys will help me out. Right? Okay. [EXCLAIMS] Okay. All right, come around the other side, and on three. One...Watch out. Watch out. Two, three... Help! [GRUNTS] [LOCK CLICKING] [EXCLAIMS] [GRUNTING] [GROANING] [PANTING] [DONNA LAUGHING] JEFF: Donna, call the police. Be careful! DETECTIVE: Oh, just try to relax, Mr. Randal. Get some rest. This was a professional job, they seldom come back. But, um, just to help you sleep better, we'll have a car patrol the area for the rest of the night. Okay?All right. Thank you, Detective. I appreciate that. Mrs. Randal. Sir.Thank you. Good night.I'll see you out. Well... Listen.[DOOR CLOSING] I am not going to let... ...some stupid thief ruin our Christmas. No. I'm gonna get the tree. You guys wanna get the decorations? Yeah.Huh? What?Let's go. Are we decorating a tree, or what? We're decorating!All right, let's go. [DONNA GIGGLES]Here, you put this one up over there. [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [BOTH MOANING] I believe this is yours. You dropped it last night. You have any idea how many of those are around? Where's yours? I lost it. You son of a bitch. You played me from the beginning. Didn't you? All you wanted to do was rob me. Go home, Donna. Jeff's back, and you're a nice little family again. You got what you wanted. I got what I wanted. So, why don't we just go back to our lives? Are you crazy? I'm not gonna let you get away with this. You're a criminal. I think I prefer "thief." It's sexier, don't you think? Your insurance will cover the loss. You're not gonna get away with this. [CAR DOOR OPENING] You were weak. And you wanted me. And you still do. You're pathetic. I'm going to the police. I wouldn't do that, if I where you. Oh? Well, you're not me. Well, I guess Jeff will have to know. And Melinda. I think I preferred you with your hair up. [CAR ENGINE STARTS] And then he threatened me. How can I let him get away with this? Ugh. The thought of Melinda in that man's class just makes my skin crawl. [SIGHS] You should have seen the smug look on his face. What am I gonna do?Nothing. You do nothing. You take the scumbag's advice, Donna, collect your insurance and get on with your life. I know you're right, but how am I gonna see him at school? And pretend that everything's all right, when there is this monster teaching my baby? You do not. I repeat, not open a can of worms here. Look, you and Jeff are finally making it work. You're gonna make yourself forget what happened. Who knows? Maybe the bastard will get caught. I told him I was going to the police. Maybe that scared him. Well, you're not going to the police. DONNA: Hi, baby. Where's Melinda? At the Cooper's. I'm going to go get her in a little while. What are you doing? Jeff? What's going on? This was delivered to my office today. [BOTH MOANING] I guess Mr. Hamilton does a little tutoring on the side. It feels like somebody just died. I really believed that you wanted me home. Hell, I even felt guilty about it. Jeff, I wanted to tell you. Well, I think that tells me everything. Jeff. I'm picking up Melinda. I think, under the circumstances, she's better off with me. You can't take Melinda.Watch me. I want her out of this house! I want her out of that school! And I don't want her anywhere near that son of a bitch! Jeff, don't do this! He's ruined my life, Roz. He has destroyed everything that's important to me. It's all my fault. I saw the way he looked at you. I saw it all coming. I should have stopped you...It's not your fault. Maybe, if you talk to Jeff again. You got to try. Just don't give up, Donna. Okay? I'm not gonna give up. I'm gonna go to the police. And once they've arrested Adam Hamilton... ...maybe Jeff will forgive me. Hmm? [DOORBELL RINGING] [SIGHS] Hi. I don't know what to say to you, Donna. I know, Mary. Is Jeff here? Ma, I got it. You got a lawyer yet? Jeff, please. Talk to me. Talk all you want. [SIGHS] When you didn't take my calls, and I didn't even hear from you on our anniversary, I felt like you abandoned us. I was hurt, and angry... Then I did something really, really stupid. Listen to me, Donna. You made your choice. And I've made mine. Wait. Um... He... [EXHALES] He's the one that broke into our house. I, uh... I found his watch and... And he admitted it to me.Really? Where did he leave his watch? Under my bed? I have a hard time believing anything you say. I know it sounds crazy, but it's the truth. [POLICE SIRENS BLARING] [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER] Have a seat. Can I get you something, Mrs. Randal? No, thank you.Cup of coffee? So, what can we do for you, Mrs. Randal? Well, I know who robbed my home. Who might that be? Adam Hamilton. He's my daughter's teacher. And why do you think your daughter's teacher is the man who robbed your home? Well, this is, um... [EXHALES] This is very difficult for me. I, um... I had, uh, what you would call a brief affair with Mr. Hamilton. And a few days ago I told him that I didn't want to see him anymore. And the next thing I knew, my house was robbed. The following morning, I found this... It's his. I confronted him with it and he admitted it. Actually, Mrs. Randal, Adam Hamilton has a very different version. [CHUCKLES] What are you talking about? The only thing your stories have in common is the affair. But, according to Mr. Hamilton, he broke it off with you. Well, that's a lie. He says, you won't let him go. You've been stalking him day and night. Calling him at all hours, showing up at his home, at school. And when he told you to leave him alone, you became angry and vindictive, and threatened to get even any way you could. He is lying.DRUMMOND: He even said, you might claim that he was the one who robbed your home. [SCOFFS] And you believe him? Frankly, Mrs. Randal, it doesn't matter who we believe. It's your word against his. And you're gonna need a heck of a lot more proof than your former lover's watch. DRUMMOND: By the way, if you are stalking him, we'd strongly advise that you stop. ROZ: Maybe, if I talk to Jeff. Maybe he'd listen to me. He's not gonna listen. He's done it before. What? Adam. He's done this all before. It explains everything. His house, his... He even said it himself. "Thief, it sounds sexier." If I can find one of his victims and convince her to go to the police. And just how do you intend to do that? Background check. Find out where he lived before, where he taught before Dalton. There must have been other robberies. I'm gonna get this guy. Are you crazy? This guy is dangerous.Yeah. He's gotta be stopped. "Robberies." [KEYBOARD CLACKING] Jan Cooper. Jan! Hi. Have you got a minute?Hi. Morning, Shannon. JAN: Donna, what is going on? Where's Melinda? Shannon told me she hasn't been in school. Yeah, um... Could we go somewhere and get a cup of coffee? Oh, I've got to get to work. Um... This is sort of awkward. But, um, I know your house was robbed.Yeah. Ours was as well. Oh, that's awful. I know, I know. And I think I know who did it. And you know him too. What are you talking about? Adam Hamilton? [SCHOOL BELL RINGING] Uh, look, I really have to go. Jan, please. Wait a minute. He seduced me too, and then robbed my home. Sound familiar? Yeah, he actually admitted it to me. This guy is a professional thief. He's evil. He set us up. And we've got to go to the police, please. We can put him away. Look. Are you crazy? [STAMMERING] I can't help you. I can't get involved. But you already are. Look, what happened between Adam and me is over, I'd like to keep it that way. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go show a house. [PHONE RINGING] WOMAN: [OVER PHONE] Dalton Academy. Yes, this is Mrs. Edwards from Boston Liberty Bank. Mr. Adam Hamilton has applied for a personal loan and I need to verify his employment. WOMAN: Mr. Hamilton is a teacher here. Uh-huh. How long has he been employed at the school? WOMAN: Mmm, just over six months. Mmm. Uh, less than a year. We're gonna need more than that. Um, do you have a record of his previous employment? Would you have that on file? WOMAN: Mmm, yes. Um, it's the Stanton Elementary School in Woodbridge. Stanton Elementary School, at Woodbridge. Mmm-hmm.Okay, thank you very much. Yes. There were a number of robberies at Woodbridge at the time he taught there. Uh-huh. I've got names, I've got addresses. Now I'm going to see if any of these victims are willing to talk. I can't believe the amount of women he's taken advantage of. All married, all with kids. [SIGHS] I mean, I must have spoken to a half a dozen of them. And not one of them is willing to help. He's a clever son of a bitch. Of course, they don't want to help. They've got too much to lose. But then, you know that. [CAR HORNS HONKING] [GASPS] Mr. Hamilton. Are you teaching here now? No, I just dropped by to see my favorite student. Actually, your mom asked me to pick you up. Okay, so I guess I'm going to my Mom's? Well, I guess so. Buckle up. So how do you like your new school? I like Dalton better. I'm sorry to hear that things aren't working out between your folks. How's your mum handling it? My mom's trying to fix things, but my dad's really mad. Well, I'm glad I get to see her today. I didn't even get to talk to her yesterday. She was up in Woodbridge, or something, all day. Woodbridge? Really? I wonder what's in Woodbridge? It's Donna. Could I speak to Melinda, please? MRS. RANDAL: She hasn't come home yet. What do you mean? She should've been home an hour ago. Well, I know. I've called the school. She never got on the school bus, Donna. Oh, I've tried to reach Jeff... Well, why didn't you call me? I am her mother, you know. Should I call the police? No, she's here. Melinda. MELINDA: Hi. Thanks for the ride, Mr. Hamilton. You're welcome. I hope my giving Melinda a ride home didn't give you cause for alarm, Mrs. Randal. Goodbye. Are you sure you're okay? Yeah, why? Just checking. Here. When are Daddy and I coming home? I love Grandma's house, but I miss you. Oh, soon, Melinda. I want things back the way they were before. I want us all back together again. How can we not be together? It's Christmas. Oh, I know, sweetheart. I want us back together too. Daddy's gonna be here any minute. Can I just sleep here tonight, Mom? Please. Maybe next weekend. Okay? JEFF: Melinda. I'm here, Daddy. Sweetie, go grab your things. We don't have a lot of time. Okay? So, what happened? This Hamilton guy went and picked Melinda up from school. He's dangerous...Donna, I don't want to hear about it. [WHISPERING] I can't believe this is happening. MELINDA: Mommy, can you please help?I got it, sweetheart. Goodbye, baby.Bye. I love you.Let's go. [CAR LOCKING] Okay. [CAR UNLOCKING] [CAR ENGINE STARTS] DONNA: I knew it. The same restaurant. This is definitely the next one. There she is. Married written all over her. Oh, my God. [EXHALES] They're leaving. I gotta go. [CAR UNLOCKING] [CAR ENGINE STARTS] Hi. I'm Donna Randal. Um, could I speak to you for a moment, Mrs... Maronville. Helen Maronville. What's this about? No. None of these incriminate Hamilton. Well, yes, but don't you see that these burglaries follow a pattern? He moves and they stop. He relocates and they start again. Besides, some of these women even admitted that they had affairs with him. And yet, not one of them will corroborate that with us. I met this woman this afternoon, Helen Maronville. She lives here in town, she has a child at Dalton and she's having an affair with Adam. So? Don't you see the pattern? It's obvious. She is his next victim. Would she be willing to come in? [SIGHING] Well, she doesn't want to get involved. She's having marital problems, and is temporarily separated. Don't you see? That could be me. I mean, Adam befriends her, seduces her, and then he robs her. But, she's having second thoughts about him. So, she told Adam that she's going away for the weekend with her husband. And you think that Hamilton's gonna take the opportunity to break into her house and rob her? It's a perfect opportunity. Why wouldn't he? "Maronville," hmm? "Maronville." Thank you. LENTINO: 2261 Silverlake. This is it. WOMAN: Yes?Ma'am. I'm Detective Lentino. This is Detective Drummond from the 25th precinct. What can I do for you, Detective? We're looking for a Helen Maronville. Yes, well, I'm Helen Maronville. This isn't Helen Maronville. I beg your pardon? LENTINO: Do you have a daughter, Mrs. Maronville? I have no children, Detective. Now, what is it you want? There's obviously been some sort of mistake. I'd like to apologize. I'm sorry for your trouble, ma'am. LENTINO: Have a good night. DRUMMOND: Happy Holidays to you. That's not the Maronville I met. Yeah, we already got that. I can't believe I let you talk us into this. Don't you see he set us up? Do us a favor, Mrs. Randal, whatever game you and Hamilton are playing, play it in your own time, all right? [GASPS] Did you really think I didn't know you were following me? Hmm?[WHIMPERS] You can't win, Donna. This is your last warning. So, you let it go. Hmm? [WHISPERING] Let it go. [KEYS JANGLING] [GRUNTING] [DOORBELL RINGING] [SIGHS] Donna, this has gone too far. [SIGHS] You're in way over your head. Honey, you listening to me? Yeah. This man, he is evil, he's ruthless. There's no way you can play in his league. [EXHALES] I'll do what I have to. I've got nothing left to lose. Except your life. [TIRES SCREECHING] [CAR APPROACHING] [BLINDS RATTLING] [DOOR OPENING] You're not gonna believe this. I have the goods on Adam Hamilton. Oh, my God. You really did it. You've got brass ones, Donna. How did he get his psychiatric file? I guess we can presume he stole it. This is sick. Do you believe his father? Pimping out his teenage son. How twisted it is that? He made his kid have sex with women to distract them while he robbed them. [EXHALES] "Adam had a love-hate relationship with his father, "which transcended the grave. "When he was a child, "his father would beat him when he wouldn't steal "and reward him when he did." If I didn't hate him so much, I'd actually feel sorry for him. So he steals out of guilt, seeking his dead father's forgiveness. That I understand, why he steals, but what's with the seduction first? He's just doing what his father taught him. Oh, my God. What? He killed a woman.What? He was 16. He strangled her with a red bra. Emily Sinclair. He said his wife's name was Emily. "Emily Sinclair, an older woman, "may have been killed in part "because she bore a close resemblance to his mother "who ran off, abandoning him, when he was five. "Exhibiting classic sociopathic behavior, "he equates all women with his mother's betrayal. "Hence, his distrust off all women "and his need to control them, "to humiliate and punish them. "And possibly, to do them harm." That's it. Drop it, Donna! Just let him go. You know what, Roz? There has to be more tapes. There have to be tapes of him with his other victims. I've got to go back, Roz. If I get those tapes, it will prove everything. [RATTLING] [DOOR CLOSING] WOMAN: So, this is where you live? Mmm. Wow, how long have you had this place? ADAM: Mmm, a couple of years. Took me that long to renovate the place. WOMAN: Wow, it's huge. [ADAM CHUCKLES] WOMAN: Don't you get lonely living here by yourself? ADAM: No. Maybe sometimes. ADAM: I'll be right back. [CAMERA BEEPING] WOMAN: Baby, I'm waiting. [FOOTSTEPS RECEDING] Why don't we wait on the champagne, hmm? WOMAN: Uh-uh-uh. Let me. Ooh.Hmm. [CHUCKLES] Uh... Oh. Oh! Mmm. [WOMAN MOANS] [WOMAN GASPS] [BOTH MOANING] [MOANS] Ten, baby. Ten plus. Mmm. [CHUCKLES] Mmm. I'd love to stay and play some more, but I need to get home before Mark does. Oh. Did Mommy take good care of her little boy? [BOTH LAUGHING] ADAM: Here you are. Ms. Preacher.Of course. ADAM: Good night.WOMAN: Good night. [DOOR CLOSING] [TIRES SCREECHING] [PHONE DIALING] Oh, come on, Roz. Why aren't you answering the phone? [RADIO STATIC] [TUNING RADIO] DONNA: [OVER RADIO] Hi, Detective Lentino, please? MAN: [OVER RADIO] Lentino? No, he's gone for the day. Do you wanna leave a message? Ugh, yes. Tell him this is urgent. It's Donna Randal. He has to call me as soon as possible. MAN: I'll tell him. DONNA: Thank you. [RADIO STATIC] JAN: [OVER RADIO] Hello, Donna. Hi, uh, it's Jan Cooper. Listen, uh... I've been thinking a lot about what you told me the other day and the thought of that man out there, doing to other woman, what he did to me, what he's done to you... I wanna help you. Okay? Um... What do you need me to do? Will you go to the police with me? JAN: Yes. DONNA: How about tomorrow? Tomorrow morning? Yeah, I can be at your place around 8:30. That would be great. DONNA: I'll be here. Yes, you will. You both will. [PHONE RINGING] Hello. It's me. DONNA: Melinda?MELINDA: Mom, I love you. Oh, sweetheart, I love you, too. I want to come home, I don't want to live with Grandma anymore. Where are you Melinda? I took the bus from Grandma's. I'm at Grove Street stop. Can you come get me? DONNA: Of course, I'll be right there! And do Mommy a favor, I want you to stay in the phone booth, okay? Close the door, and I don't want you to talk to anybody. Do you understand? I'm gonna have to drop you off at Roz's for a little while. DONNA: And then we'll spend the rest of the day together. Okay? Okay. DONNA: All right, I'll be right there. [CAR DOOR CLOSING] [CAR ENGINE STARTING] Hello? Jan? Jan? Where are you? [GASPS] ADAM: You shouldn't have done it, Donna! You, my jilted lover and stalker, luring my current lover here to kill her. But, you end up killing each other. It's rather clever, don't you think? Adam...You know the old expression... Killing two birds with one stone? Just put the knife down. [EXCLAIMS] [SCREAMS] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [GRUNTS][SCREAMS] [GRUNTS] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [SCREAMING] Geez, Donna! What's going on? He tried to kill me! Who?Hamilton! [DOOR CREAKING] There's no one in here. No! [GRUNTS] [SCREAMING] [GRUNTING] [PANTING] No! [GRUNTING] [STRAINING] [DONNA WHIMPERING] [CHOKING] [DONNA STRAINING] [GRUNTING] [GRUNTING] [GRUNTING] [THUDDING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [GROANS] Oh, my God! Are you okay? Here, come here. Come here.

My husband has been stabbed. Please, please hurry. [GROANING] Hold on baby. Hold on, I know.[GROANING] I know, you're gonna be okay.[GROANING] Talk to me. Hey... Please, just talk to me. JEFF: I'm sorry I didn't believe you. DONNA: Everything's gonna be okay. I love you. JEFF: I love you too, baby. [SIRENS WAILING]
