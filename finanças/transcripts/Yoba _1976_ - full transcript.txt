1976 National Arts Festival Participant Produced by Daiei and Nagata Production You may not believe what I'm about to tell you. No, I'm sure you'll think that I'm lying. What I am about to tell you here really did happen in the Taisho era. And it happened here in Tokyo, a place where we have been accustomed to. A place where, if we go outside, there are trains and cars running. And, when we come home, there's a phone ringing. If we look at the newspapers, there are reports of strikes and women's movements. In such a day and era, in one corner of this great city, Taisho 8 (1919) this strange incident happened. No matter how much I insist that it's true, it's understandable if you don't believe me. No matter how humanity's science has conquered the natural world, there remains a hidden corner of nature's map that we are still unable to unfold. Even in this city of Tokyo, bathed by the light of civilization, astonishing supernatural phenomenons are constantly appearing like a beautiful flurry of light.

Don't worry about anything. Don't feel bad, I will go and greet all the guests. If you say so. Please excuse me. He looks like a scholar. You do have a good eye. He deserves to be the heir of this place. It would be a great help if he could take over the gold mines in Tohoku one day. Everything will be fine. You have found a good man. Thank you. Thanks for the meal! Why are you in such a hurry? Take it slow. They said they want to return to the shop and drink some more. Is that so? They can drink without hesitation that way. That's right. Well, it's true that drinking in one's own shop is better, no? He is the best son-in-law you could have. - And your daughter also seemed happy. - Really? - I'd say so. - I'm sure he will be a good young master. Please kindly help him, too. Yes, we will need your support as well. He came from a completely different field, didn't he? What are you saying? Ma'am. Would you like me to help you in the kitchen? It's okay, Sawa-chan. You're a guest. I can't let you do that. Next time, it's Sawa's turn to marry, right? If you find someone nice, please introduce him. How about you, Nobu-kun? She's not going to like me. Now, if you excuse me. Thank you. Please excuse ourselves. Don't joke about it. Sawa-chan. Go ahead and take a bath. You're going to sleep downstairs tonight, okay? I know you've always slept at the second floor, but, you know... Indeed. I understand. I think I'll go ahead and rest. Mitsuya... - Mitsuya! - Yes? Get Sawa-chan's nightgown ready. Is it okay if I take the one that the young miss wears? Hush. She's the young missus now. Let me hold your hand. Can I come over there? Yes. Please... turn off the lights. No, I want to see your face. I'm embarrassed. Sorry. I'm tired. Where did this come from? What's with this comb? It just come out of the young master's kimono. What? Is this yours, Shima-chan? No, it's not. She said it came from your husband's kimono sleeve. Why a woman's comb? Oh? Are you ready to go? Yes. Are you going to make your rounds, greeting everyone? They'll visit places that are closer first, just the two of them. Like the matchmaker's place. Just the two of you, so no one can bother you, huh? It's not like that. It's just more convenient. How nice of you. What? I understand. Here. What's wrong with everyone? We need to finish breakfast quickly. Call them. The young madam says she doesn't want to eat. This is Sawa's comb. What? I'm pretty sure because I saw her wearing it on her bangs. There's something wrong with your body. Please, come in. There's nothing wrong with a newlywed couple not having good sex within the first or second month of marriage. But he said that I am not normal. He said that? Yes. He is in a very bad mood these days. He goes outside every day and never comes home. Isn't that just his nerves? I'll examine you, and we can see if something is wrong. This way, please. Is something wrong? Hey, you! Get her in there! My mother said she found your comb, and she blamed me for it. Isn't that just a false accusation? How can you say so? The madam was actually against it from the start, but her husband, who arranged the marriage just pushed it through. A businessman can't be as good as a child keeper, anyway. But you do like Shima-chan, don't you? But still, it's unexpected that some people say I'm doing this to get my hands on the family's wealth. I'm jealous. When I heard that the marriage has been decided, I thought to myself, how lucky is Shima-chan to be married to you. Say. Since she's an only child, the madam always called me over to their place, and we both grew up like sisters. We practiced together. So I've heard. As for sewing, Shima-chan was better than me because she received better education at home. But I was better than her at performing Nagauta. I sang "Funabenkei", while she sang "Kanjincho". I didn't want to lose to someone three years younger. I worked really hard at that time. So, what can I do for you? If I can be useful to you, I'd do it. Everything is fine. Perhaps your husband was impatient, or simply unfamiliar with the situation. I'll see you out. No, I'm not leaving just yet. - I can't stand that heavy mood at home. - Oh my. I'll stay with you to help you feel better, then. I'm worried about you. The watchman said he saw it. He's going out and about even though he's just married, walking around with another woman during the day, it's just too much. In addition, I heard him say that something's wrong with Shima-chan. No one would take his words seriously. It's inappropriate for us parents to intervene in a married couple's quarrel. Are you sure he was walking with Sawa-chan? Yes. It's not normal for him to hold on Sawa-chan's comb on his wedding day, don't you think? We've got one hell of a son-in-law. Would you like me to send him to Mt. Shinzan for a while? I think it's useless. Poor Shima-chan. She's just an innocent girl. To be treated like she carries a defect like that! Shinzo, he's not infertile, isn't he? That's right. I'm going to continue my affair with Sawa-chan. She'll hide under the shadows and beckon me softly. Unlike you, who's from a reputable house, she's risking herself by coming to see me. There's something cute about her, and it's tickling a man's nature to want to protect her somehow. So, she and you will continue.. That's right. I'll take her to the gold mine and leave her to stay at the second home there, and you can take care of the main house here. So, I am just for show? But isn't that just the fact? No matter. Being adopted as an heir is hard. I'm always being under scrutiny. I don't know where you've been following me. No. The watchman just happened to see you, and Sawa-chan together. Is that so? Well, I don't care. If you don't like this, just say so and I will leave this house. I don't like it when people say I'm aiming for your family's fortune. I see. So, you're a virgin wife and another woman has taken your husband? Relax your shoulders. Take a deep breath in and breathe out. Your marriage is a bad match. You should get a divorce. Isn't there some way to recover from this? Unfortunately, there's an evil spirit who fell in love with her husband. But I feel sorry for your daughter. Rather than letting her fall as a prey to a man possessed by such an evil spirit, if you really want your daughter to be happy, she must first end this evil relationship. It's like being watched by a demon. You should get rid of this man. I feel like I should do something to save this young, innocent lady. Otherwise, she'll lose her mind! If you want to end up ruining your life without ever knowing happiness, you can go on and continue serving that man, but you must be given "a breath of life" to prevent you from going insane. Return here when you've made up your mind and decide to undergo the ritual. Yes. The first thing you need to do is to cut your relationship with this man. And then, pray to our sun god, the center of our life, and get back on your feet. Yes. Once you've made up your mind, come alone next time. The evil spirit is clinging around all of you, it's difficult to do things here. If you're worried, you can just drop her off here, and pick her up again once we're done. Then, let me do so. Please take care of her. You, please come with me to the altar for a moment. I feel like there's an evil spirit clouding over your person. We have to get rid of that evil spirit first. Please help her. You were very wrong about that man. That's why I quickly decided to put an end to this problem. As you should! According to the watchman, he took out the store's money again yesterday. If we don't do something soon, it's gonna be too late. We have no other choice. Let's talk to him about it. Are we going to ask him to leave? We'd better do so before Shima gets hurt. We should! He even called her a "defect". Does he still see Sawa-chan? I don't know. But he did say that he won't leave Shima-chan. He did? Well, it doesn't matter, anyway. It's like Sawa-chan's the one who's taking care of him. Anyway, we have to act fast while he hasn't done anything to our daughter. Whatever the method, she should cut her relationship with that man. Even with a purification ritual, it's hard to cleanse it. The evil spirit must like her very much. Yes, I asked the priest to bless her, so that no man will betray her in the future, after the evil spirit is cleansed. Well, I'll leave you to it. Yes. It's a disaster. The master's going out! Four years later, the Great Kanto Earthquake turned the entire downtown area into a sea of fire. Oshima lost her parents, her house, and her store in a single night. The servants were buried under the crumbling bricks or burned to death. Oshima, who was attending a sewing class, was the only survivor, and later fled to Ueno. Here you go. You can sit here. May I? We will still have to walk a long way to Akabane. Thank you. Even though last night you slept outdoors in Ueno, it wasn't too comfortable, so you must be tired. Will the train really depart from Akabane? Where to? I have no idea, but I just want to get away as far as I can. Thank you. I have a house nearby, only one staff stays there. He won't bother anyone, so you can stay there for two or three months. I see. But what about your family? Well, my wife's parents live in Hokkaido, and she's there now, so there's less burden on me for now. If there were children about, I wouldn't be able to tend to my business. I was just about to start a paper mill, but then, I'm back to square one on everything. What's wrong? Please, go on ahead. Are you okay? It must be difficult for a woman to ride a train alone. Moreover, in this unstable situation, it's dangerous to walk alone. The rail ahead is broken! If you can continue by walking, it's better to do so! The rail is broken! Excuse me! How long until the train can run again? We don't have enough manpower, so we can't really say. Excuse me. Please, let me pass. Let me help you. This way. It's cold water. Drink it. It's so cold! Here's a hand towel. It feels good. - Where did you get that from? - I asked someone to share it. It's beef and chicken. Take it. Okay, let's cut it half and half. I already ate. I was hungry, so I ate some while you were sleeping. Thank you very much. All this freshly cooked rice? Have you ever been married? Just the ceremony. That kind of thing can happen? It's true. Well, it doesn't really matter. Eat lots of food and hang in there. It's delicious. I look at you and I feel bad, I can't just leave you alone. Here you go. Is it good? Chew it well. My wife hates to take care of the kids. Is this how you take care of your children? That's right. I'm already used to it. Don't leave anything, eat them all. Yes. What are you thinking about? You're not feeling well? You're so innocent. Why do you say so? I wish this journey goes on forever. I don't mind, even if you're going to kill me after. You could be a murderer. Why do you say that? I don't know. But I know that Shima-chan, the murderer, will kill me now. That's a terrible thing to say! It's true. Shima-chan, the murderer. I feel like I'm about to fall into the depths of the ocean. You have no regrets? Let me show you this. So cute. Is this your wife? My daughter's name is Chidori. When she turned three, a friend from England came and took her picture. She's really cute. Really cute! I really like to dote on her. Why is she so cute? I'm sorry for what I did to you. I don't mind. There's nothing I can do about it now. I'm the one who's sorry to your wife. I don't want to let you go. I don't care what anyone says. It's a telegram from Hokkaido. Chidori fell into a jug of water lilies and died. Come home now! I'm home. Huh? What's wrong? I received news that Chidori has died. It's said that she fell into a water jug. It was the mother's carelessness. I can't believe it. I hope it's not true. - You're going to go there now? - Yes. She is just a wife who can't do anything anyway. I will be back soon. I need to tell you something. What do you want to tell me? What is it? I'm pregnant. What?! But in these two months since you came here... It's still early, but I'm sure of it. How can you be so sure? I had a dream. What dream? Chidori-chan! The ghost of a child rising from a jug of water lilies, she hugged me and wouldn't leave me. What's wrong? What are you sad about, Chidori-chan? How dare you take a my husband?! Could that be your wife's voice? I've never heard her voice before, but I did hear the harsh voice of a woman. Is there such a thing as a living spirit? It could be, but still... The way Chidori-chan died was not normal. When I think about it, it makes me afraid of giving birth. Midwife Excuse me. How are you feeling? We're not going anywhere if you're this tense. I've never seen anything like this before. Most of them would just endure the treatment and returned home soon after. I intended to have the baby, no matter what, and then, let this child meet the father. Don't be so stubborn. He's left for Tokyo, together with his wife. I'm sure a man like him is busy, but I hope I can go outside again when I regain my strength. That is good. That man has no intention of being with you, at all. If you rely on such a person, you too will be dragged into misfortune. If you understand this, use this chance to break off the relationship and start fresh. In the meantime, you need to eat properly. Why is it taking so long? Right now, your womb is exhausted. You need to take plenty of nourishment. Otherwise, you'll lose. Here, you need to fight. To dispel the evil beings attached on your body, you mustn't rely on weird tricks or evil gods. How can you tell which ones are the kind gods, and which are the evil gods? Most of them are animal spirits or low-level spirits. They'll listen to all kinds of people's wishes, even evil ones. These people felt grateful, and they started to gather more believers. These "gods" tell the people to do evil things, it's a proof that they're not real gods. A real god would not let such evil happen. I had someone did an exorcism ritual on me. An ascetic? Yes, he even took me to a waterfall. Maybe it's still clinging on you yet. It's not going away that easily. Is it going to stay with me forever? Maybe they're trying to suck your blood out of you, like a leech. It's not normal for someone to suffer this much. You're not gonna eat that? You can't fight back if you're hungry. How can I get back on my feet again? I want to start my life over. Just one more time. After this matter is settled, I want to live under the sun again, until the end of my days. Please God, save me. You have to wish it. If you pray hard enough, maybe your wish will be granted. There's not much else that I can do for you now. I have some prayer beads that I received from Kannon-sama before. I'll rub your body with this prayer beads. Let's see what happens. May the baby's vengeful spirit leave this woman. May they go to heaven without any regrets. Please listen to our prayers. It's so hot... Winter, 10 years later I know it is selfish of me, but I would appreciate your help. Yes. I'll have it tailored as soon as possible. It seems that you have a lot of orders, and it would be more efficient if your apprentice could handle them. I don't like the idea of having my apprentice seamstress make this cloth as their training piece, so I will do it myself with all my heart. That's why your business has such a good reputation. I'm leaving it in your hands. Please give my regards to the landlady. I will tell her. Please excuse me. Excuse me, I heard there is a famous tailor around here by the name of Oshima. Her place is right there. Ah, so this is the correct place. I've come here from afar. So many people came all the way from afar to visit her. I'm sure she's very busy, then. I can't say much since we're not close, but she doesn't receive a lot of orders. Does she work slowly? She probably could finish it faster, but even when there's a lot of orders, she sews all of them by herself, day and night. That's impressive. She doesn't even have a husband? Yes, she's very devoted to her work, which is probably why she has such a good reputation. I see. I heard that, when a person wears a kimono that she made, for some reason they all look more beautiful than usual. How nostalgic. Since the earthquake, I've never visited Tokyo anymore. It's been so many years. I heard that you fled to the vicinity of Ikaho, so I knew you're safe, at least. But I'm surprised that you made it back to Asakusa. I'm sorry to bother you, I know you're busy. Have you been staying single, all this time? Yes. What about you, Sawa-chan? I've been in and out of relationships with different guys. I have bad luck with men. I've been dumped several times already. Men are so unfaithful. I had a hard time. I wasn't in a position to meet you. Just when I thought I had finally found happiness, he died at the same time as he made the promise. I'm not talking about Esaki-san. There was nothing between me and Shinzo-san, even though people were suspicious of us. That was a long time ago. Since then, I've fallen in love several times. Once, my fiancé left me before the wedding ceremony, and I even had his child. You kept the baby? Of course! Without a family name, the child doesn't have a proper legal status. But it's my most precious treasure. No matter what the public says, I kept on going and raised my own child. Oh my! I had a hard time. For the sake of my Otoshi, I've done so many unthinkable things. I've even stolen a few things. Searching under a guest's pillow and everything. The earthquake wiped out the entirety of Yokohama, and there's no one I can rely on. With Otoshi in my arms, I wondered how a woman could survive on her own. In the end, I ended up relying on men. You're doing fine just by yourself, but I cannot do the same thing. Oh, please forgive me, I heard about your business' reputation, so I thought I must come and visit. I know it's silly of me, but I want my daughter to wear a kimono that you tailored. Somehow, she grew up to be a good girl, and a rich family took a liking to her. I sent her to be an apprentice at a kimono store. The store owner has a son named Shinzo. He's not like that Shinzo Esaki, he's young and newly joined the store. They just put him in charge of the new warehouse here. The owner and his wife also like my daughter very much. They already agreed to marry their son off to my daughter! I need a favor. When I heard about your reputation as a tailor, I just knew that it must be you and I couldn't stay still. I really missed you. Anyway, I heard that wearing a kimono you made, increases the attractiveness of the wearer. That's not true. Sometimes, all these talks and gossips make me worry. Don't be like that, Shima-chan. This comes from my heart as a parent, please hear my request. Let's take this as a chance to forget the past misunderstandings between us. We both have no one to rely on, let's help each other! Ouch! The needle! Thank you. It's looking good. Sorry to keep you waiting, ma'am. Thank you for choosing us. Thank you. Please, go ahead and have a drink. Here you are. Is Isoko-sensei alright? Yeah, the permanent machine just came in today and we're testing it. Oh, that must be quite a hassle. It's not easy being a barber. But I'm surprised Oshima took it on. Where in Asakusa is she? Are you planning to visit her? Of course not, I'm just curious. Don't worry about it. I see you're still not over her yet. Don't tease me. I'm going to tell Isoko-sensei. You're an idiot. I'm an idiot, that's why I came all the way here to Kamiya. Oh, come on. I'm serious. And? What about it? - Are you that afraid of her? - No! You sure have changed. You've become much more careful. You're spineless. Stop being snide. My life depends on this job. Don't be ridiculous. I have to look out for my customers, too. This is a woman's business. - Then, please take care of yourself. - I know. If Oshima were to accept your request, she wouldn't do it for free. Why? Because she thinks you're the one who screwed up her entire life. Me? Your comb came out of my clothes, you know. I don't care who put it there, but I was desperate with the situation, so I decided to go with you. It's a prank. After all, in the end, you abandoned me too, and I've been the target of grudge from both of you for over a decade. It's all in the past. As a professional tailor, maybe she doesn't think about it anymore. Or maybe, she'll make you a kimono laced with a curse. Don't scare me like that. She might infuse her grudge into that kimono she's making. Why would you ask her to do it for your only daughter's wedding kimono? She carefully does each stitch with her own hands, and her creations have a reputation for giving the wearer a beautiful glow. Everyone wants one. She's good at promoting her business. She was such a sheltered young lady. She's changed completely. Besides, we were close as cousins, it shouldn't be a problem. But still, I'll tell you this. Please don't think that I'm accepting Otoshi-chan as my child. What? Of course not! Even if it's just a joke, it's not funny. Please, don't... That's enough. It's not like I want this. Excuse me. Please, through here. It's nice of you to come. What an impressive place you have here. It's nothing. I share this place with three of my colleagues. We're relying on our salary. It's not an easy life. I wish I had good skills like you do. Such a nice room. Please, have a sit. I was hoping you could have a meal with me. Please, relax. I wanted to invite you as a guest, so I sent someone to pick you up. I'm so happy that you came. I wanted you to come visit my place, even if it's just once. Your parents took such a great care of me in the past. Even though I was such a nuisance to them, they took care of me like their own child. Excuse me. Tell Otoshi-chan to come here, and greet our guest. Yes. Here you are. You said you have something to tell me. What is it? Oh, it's nothing. It's nothing, at all. I thought you wouldn't come unless I said something like that. It's nothing serious. I just wanted to have dinner with you. I pray to the gods of Basara Okami. Please let Oshima, a 33-year-old tailor, lose his resentment towards Osawa. Please, purge these 15 years of misfortune. Please help us to keep Osawa out of harm's way. Please lend your support to Osawa's daughter, Otoshi. Basara-Okami! Basara-Okami! This girl is Otoshi. It's nice to meet you. The kimono suits you very well. I thought you would like to see her in her kimono. Your skill is amazing. I've never seen Otoshi look this pretty. Say thank you. Thank you, ma'am. It's nothing. You wear it so well. Really, it's nothing that great. Serve some tea for the auntie. Come on. Here's your tea. I hope we can still keep in contact, just like the old times. I feel the same. Thank you very much for this favor, Shima-chan! It's nothing. Thank you for treating me this meal. Don't say that. We're both old, and have no one to rely on, and fate has brought us to meet again. And, like I've told you before, with your help, I'm finally on my way to find happiness again. You've been through a lot. Raising a child alone as a woman. - Yeah, well, she's a fatherless child. - I see. Yet, you've come so far. I did my best. Good for you. But she's a lonely girl. Isn't that right? I'm glad you were able to help her with something. It was really nothing. I know I can count on you. Oshima, the tailor in Asakusa, has a reputation for being as good as Shimada's Oteru, the famous hairdresser. You are like a woman among women.. Oh, stop it. I'm just a mere tailor. I'm one who should be thanking you. I'm jealous. There you go again. Right? I'm always jealous at everything. But really, I've never been better than you at anything. But you have a good daughter now, don't you? Yes, but it took a lot of work to get this far. I don't have anything like that. Having a good daughter. I guess I win on that one. Otoshi-chan, pour a drink for auntie. It's so nice to see you again after such a long time. Basara Okami, Basara Okami... Basara Okami, Basara Okami... It's because of the alcohol you drank. I'll come back and check on you again in a few days. I'm sorry. I'll make sure to finish your order in time. Please take care of yourself. Please give my regards to the landlady. Of course. This is for you. Whenever misfortune strikes, this bead of Kannon-sama will purge your sins and impurities. Not only the dead spirit of a child, the living spirit of someone else can also cause a disaster. The God of Basara Okami, please... Are you alright? Are you alright? This is not easy. It's not normal. There is something that is blocking my power. What? What could that be? And the spirit is too bad to leave easily. I need to recompose myself and pray once more to Basara Okami. Or else, nothing can be done here. Basara Okami, Basara Okami... Good morning. Oh. Thank you for the dinner the other day. You're welcome. I'm so glad you came. Please, come in. Don't bother, I'm not going to stay for long. Are you a believer of some sort of religion? Those beads. This? It's nothing... I was once possessed by the spirit of a child. A spirit? It's a dead person's spirit. It was my fault, and I was given this prayer beads of Kannon-sama to help purge it. Is it working? I think it's only to ease my nerves, and I'm not feeling well these days. What happened? I'm just not feeling well. Oh, my. An unhealthy body can be a problem. Please take good care of yourself. You're the only auntie that Otoshi has, you know. Please help her in any way you can. And it's not good for either of us if there's a misunderstanding here. I don't want there to be any ill feelings between us. Hey, you know, I'm glad you broke up with Shinzo. That man is now working as a master at Yagumo Beauty Salon. So I've heard. It might sound posh, but really, a hairdresser? That job suits him, I guess. I heard he's still fooling around as usual. I'm not surprised. Why did you come today? I was just in the neighborhood. Maybe I shouldn't have come and bothered you. I also haven't had a chance to thank you yet. Here, it's sponge cake. Shima-chan, you like it, don't you? But I just keep on receiving things from you. You used to eat half of the cake by yourself and then washed it down with lots of water. In the end, you needed to go the toilet in the middle of the night. It was agonizing. Please, take it. Thank you very much. Don't be so stiff. I would love us to reuturn to how we were, from now on. Let's just get along nicely, okay? Of course. That's what I wanted to say. Is that so? I'm having a hard time thinking that I have caused of your divorce. Because there was never anything between us. Even I was annoyed. It's all in the past. It doesn't really matter now. Really? You don't have any doubt about it, do you? About me and Shinzo. Even though you may have ruined my life, or rather, my future... No... Even if that were true, it would be my own fault, since I'm the one who had misjudged him. So, l can't really blame anyone. But it's definitely not me. Trust me on that. No matter how much I'm inclined to want other people's things, I wouldn't go that far. Why are you worrying about that now? I'm not worried, I just want to brag to everyone that Oshima the tailor is a close cousin of mine that I grew up with. Besides, Otoshi will be getting married in a couple of years, and it would be convenient for the guests to know that she's related to the daughter of a rich and influential man who once had a gold mine. After all, Otoshi is also pretty good at socializing. Is that it? What do you mean? It's important. You don't know how society works like I do, so you can't imagine how my daughter will be worth. I'm sorry for being so selfish. In return, I'll do whatever I can to help you, Shima-chan. It's okay. I swear by Heaven, Earth, and Life that I have not done anything shameful towards you. Do you understand me? Yes. Oh, that's good to hear! Now, I can finally sleep soundly. It's been a really hard 15 years, being falsely accused. But I'm glad. I feel like a weight has been lifted. I'm really glad. I'm so glad. Thank you for this. I'm going to the sushi restaurant for a bit. Oh, don't worry about me. No, it's really close. Just give me a minute. Come on, you don't have to do that. Shima-chan, you don't have to worry about it. Welcome back. Maybe you dropped it outside somewhere? No. I was just right outside when I noticed it's gone. I'm sure you will find it soon enough. I've kept it with me so securely, how could it be gone? The Great God made her drop it. It is not good to go against Basara Okami. Now, this Oshima will do whatever you want her to. Don't worry, she won't resent you nor go against you. Thank you very much. So, how much do I have to pay you? No need. The person shall become the payment. The God Basara Okami wants Oshima to be a human sacrifice. Human sacrifice? What kind of payment is this? It is said that Basara Okami's spiritual power will suck the life out of human beings. Does that mean, Shima-san? She was chosen to be a living sacrifice. But all I wanted was to make sure Shima-san doesn't hold a grudge against me, or do something bad to me. I never promised to sacrifice my cousin to the gods. This is your reward from Basara Okami, this is what Basara Okami wants to do. Oshima-san? Are you alright? Oshima-san? Thank you for your concern. I'm just getting more sluggish by the day. That's not good. Please, let me know if I can be of any assistance. Excuse me. I'm coming in. Oh, Oshima-san! You need to get treated and restore your health. I don't know, I just feel strange. I'm sorry to keep you all waiting, but my condition is not getting any better. So, someone's visiting her every night? Yes. I wonder if it was a man? Sometimes, I hear a strange moaning sound. - Oshima-san! Oshima-san! - Oshima-san! Someone said they heard moaning last night, too. Did something happen to her? Oshima-san! I thought you weren't home. I am sorry for making you all worry. Excuse me, master. Master? Master? For rent I'm sorry for making you worry. Since that day, I can't find what happened to her. She said she was going to the hospital and left, but she never returned. Not even a goodbye for me or Otoshi. I've done everything I can. I just hope she's still alive somewhere. I wanted her to come to the wedding ceremony, but it's been some time, and still no news about her whereabouts. I'm afraid that she might be dead somewhere out there. Do you know where she could have gone? Where could she have gone to? I really don't know. By the way, on my way here, I passed the Ichinohashi Bridge in Honjo. On the rising tide, the boatmen said they found a body of a woman. They were discussing how to bring it to the police station. And then? I don't think it's her, because they said it was a body of an elderly woman. I'll check again with them on the way back. An elderly woman? Not a middle-aged woman, I hope. Well, I wonder how old the woman was that they found? This is some incident. I guess she must have thrown herself into the water. - The body will soon float to the surface. - This is bad. They were catching some marlin this morning. And when they throw the net, they caught that body. I guess the body must have floated up last night. It must be a sign from the gods. Look at the soles of her feet! There's an amulet attached on it! Basara Okami What a strange case indeed. Excuse me. Coming! Otoshi! Please, do not come here again. Otherwise, something life-threatening will happen to you. Where's the long-haired old lady? She'll be right back. You need to go now! What do you mean my life is at stake? I don't understand! Don't be like this! Please, just go! Go now! It's dangerous! Please, please, I beg you, hurry up! Okay. I'll come back when the long-haired old lady returns. No, I want to stay here, after all. Do not come in! Terrible things will happen! Please! Otoshi! Go home! It's dangerous! Please, leave! I'm begging you. Otoshi! Wait for me! I will help you! Please, wait. Before you go to the police, if anything happens to Otoshi, it will all be too late. I'll go take a look myself. You are calling from a soba noodle shop in Honjo, right? I'll be right there. I think that long-haired old woman is Oshima-san whose life force has been sucked out by Basara Okami. I think she's been granted some psychic powers now. I'm afraid Otoshi will also have her life force sucked out by Basara Okami to increase her psychic powers. If I pray hard and beg to Basara Okami, I am sure she will listen to me, a believer. Even if it costs me my life! Your resistance is futile. Hello? Hello? Hello, Shinzo-san? Hello? The person who came today is my fiancee, Shinzo-san. I love that man with my whole life. I was happy because that man also loves me. I've been waiting for the day when I can give my body and soul to him. And yet, and yet... I am drained of all my life energy. He said he'd bring me out of here tonight. Before he went, he has sworn that he would rescue me, even if it costs his own life. I'm sure he will come. Otoshi! Otoshi! What are you doing here? Otoshi! Otoshi! What have you done? Otoshi! Hang on, Otoshi! You infidel who does not fear divine punishment! How dare you?! It's too late now. You can't take back a daughter that I have presented to the gods. How dare you do such a terrible thing to Otoshi?! Mother! Mother! No, it's dangerous! What if you also drown? Don't let go of my hand! Understand? Yes. The next morning, only Sawa's body was found. After that, the police conducted a search, but Oshima's body never turned up. Could it be that Oshima's still alive? Even I do not know if this unfortunate Oshima is still alive or already dead. THE END
