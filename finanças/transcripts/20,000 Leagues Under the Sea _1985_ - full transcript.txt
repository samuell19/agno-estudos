(adventurous music) - We surely cannot make it. - Yes, we can. - Either way, we lose. - Look, there's worse yet. (adventurous music) (gentle music) (birds croaking) - Oh what luck, I even managed to save my journal. - Yes, and we saved our skins too, but to what purpose? - For one purpose, none other, to describe our amazing experiences to an unsuspecting world. (adventurous music) (gentle music) (men snoring) (gentle music) (professor clapping) - Gentlemen, please, wake up. - Professor, I thought I was dreaming. - Me too. - No, it's no dream. We're safe and I do believe we have found shelter. Look up there. (birds chirping) - I know this part of Norway. The seas are notorious so they built these huts all along the coast for shipwrecked sailors. - I thank heaven for that. (door creaking) (mysterious music) We can wait here for rescue while I write down the incredible experience we've just been through. - I'll gather some firewood from the beach. - And I shall write while you dictate, professor. - Very kind, I'm sure, Conseil. (light music) (clearing throat) Purpose and discovery were high on my mind this last year. It was a year of a sinister sea phenomenon, which will not be forgotten for a long time. (adventurous music) 1866 found me in the United States, accompanied by my eager apprentice, a lad who had shown such early flare for marine science. He had been assigned to me by scholarship. - [Reporter] Monster sinks another ship, marine experts baffled. - Professor, if I may respectfully inquire? - Yes, Conseil? - Does the professor have any fears for this expedition? - Most certainly. The professor knows there is great danger ahead of us. - Uh uh, so you're the professor I've heard about. - Professor Pierre Aronnax at your service. - Ned Land , harpoonist at your service. - Sea monster sinks another ship. Marine experts baffled. Sea monster sinks another ship. Marine experts baffled. - And do you admit to being baffled, professor? - I have a theory that this sea monster is nothing more than a freakishly oversized narwhal, monsieur. - Could it not be manmade, this monster? Perhaps it is a ship. - Ships do not rise from the depths of the ocean, strike at target and then return to the bottom, Conseil. - No, they do not and a good thing too. - Ah, Commander Farragut, have you met our marine expert here? - Howdy do. - Ashante, commander. - As you say, professor, ships do not sail under water and this creature has destroyed a dozen ships. We must not fail in our mission. We must clear the seas of it. - All aboard! - So, we set sail. Come aboard gentlemen. (adventurous music) - Ahoy, see the almighty glow! (ominous music) - Whoa. - What was that? - The monster! - No, it's coming towards us. - Full steam, we must retreat. - But commander! - This thing exceeds any power known. I cannot condemn my ship to oblivion. - But just let the monster taste my harpoon. - That glow is very peculiar. It must be phosphorus in the water. - Just let it get closer. Just let me harpoon it. - It'd be like shoving a toothpick into an elephant. Harpoon indeed, cannons fire! (ominous music) (canons firing) - You've got it! - There he is! - Stopped in its tracks! - The beast is simply tired from the chase. - Who was talking about toothpicks? Watch this! (adventurous music) There, it's finished! - You've done it in! (ominous music) (cannons firing) (bells ringing) - [Male] We can't control the ship's course. (bells ringing) - Oh help, help! (water bubbling) Is it you? - Awaiting orders, professor. - But how, how did you? - Come professor, swim. - Swim, swim where? - To that beam over there. - My clothes are pulling me under. - Ahoy there! - Monsieur Land? - Where, where are you? - But how do you float like that? - I'm sitting on our monster's back. - You killed it? - No, not even my harpoon can penetrate sheet metal. - It can't be. - I'm afraid it is. - It is a vessel. - It is an underwater ship. - Yes and I don't fancy sitting here when it decides to submerge. - This is some kind of doorway. (door squeaking) What gas could create such powerful light? - There is no gas which could. - Close that hatch. - We have no alternative but to enter. - No! - You said to yourself, if it submerges- - No! You're signing your own death warrants. You're fools to offer yourselves. - Look, a galley. - Food? Hmm, well... (mysterious music) (water bubbling) (slurping) (men giggling) (light music) - Look, a stove! (gentle music) (professor sniffing) - There is no gas in the air. - Just oxygen, which we consume with ease. - You consume the oxygen and I'll take care of the food. I'm starving. (sizzling) Yow, it's burning and there are no flames. - Then what can create this heat? (ominous music) (electricity zapping) - Yow! (ominous music) (doors opening) (gasps) - We were passing by and we got a little hungry. - Please Ned, Professor Pierre Aronnax, marine scientist astounded I must say by a vessel I have only dreamt of. As we found ourselves victims of the sea- - Not the sea, him, victims of a murdering pirate. - Ned, keep a sealed tongue. (clears throat) As a consequence of this unfortunate, please gentlemen. - [Ned] They ain't gentlemen. (Ned grunting) You've bent my harpoon, caused us bad inconveniences, interrupted my dinner. Hey, I'm hungry! - Hmm. (ominous music) - [Ned] Hands off! (grunting) (ominous music) - We are submerging! - And still breathing. - Hmm, I'm hungry. - It is indeed a wonder, in this year of 1866, we are actually traveling under the ocean. (whimsical music) - It must be morning. - Who'd ever know trapped down here? - Yes, gentlemen? - Don't even try talking. My pet seal understands more than these. I hope these gentlemen are announcing breakfast. And what can this ocean killer be wanting from us now? - Monsieur Ned, your tongue is like a razor. - And may end up by cutting your own throat. - These foreigners can't understand a word of English. Wonder what can they want? - Oh I understand and it's nothing I want of you. Was it I, Captain Nemo, who sought you out? - We cannot say it was, captain. - No, you cannot. Remove those two, take them to the galley. - Hey breakfast, well now you're talking my language. (whimsical music) - Come with me, professor. Professor, I wanted time to consider your fate. I've read your books and I'm familiar with your work. - And I am in awe of yours. - There is much you cannot know. (whimsical music) - What nation can have constructed this marvel? - None! This is the Nautilus, a tiny nation unto itself answerable only to me. Those who sail here have broken all the ties on Earth. - But surely, some nation with warlike intent has financed its enormous cost. - She was financed by the ocean. This is my bank. My pursors are making a withdrawal right now. (whimsical music) - Then your deposits can only have been put there by pirates. - I fight for those who can no longer fight. I use their capital to right the wrongs done to them. - Surely sir, nothing can be gained by roaming the seas to settle all scores. - Rest assured, I have good reasons. (alarm beeping) (dramatic music) A giant squid is advancing on us! (alarm blaring) All to surface! Quick men, scramble up! (alarm blaring) Watch out! (alarm blaring) Set the engine to ascend! Increase power! - Captain! - Get a grip on him! Get this machine to the surface. (alarm blaring) (dramatic music) (captain yelling) (dramatic music) (alarm blaring) (squid squealing) (whimsical music) Well Captain Nemo, I see your style of banking has its hazards. - I don't remember calling for your help. - And I don't recall asking for your gratitude. - You shan't require this then. - But I'm the hero of the day. - You are an uninvited guest and as such, you'll abide by my rules. - Do tell. And what might those be? - First, you will not mistake your knife for your fork. - The only mistake I made was in saving a certain tyrant. - And when I'm engaged in private work, you will all be confined to your cabin. - You mean when you're blowing ships up? - [Nemo] Watch your manners, man! - I'm watching this veal and a rare treat it is, sir. - And a rare fool you are, sir. That is not veal. All our produce comes from the ocean. You are eating fried sea urchin. Perhaps a hunt will provide food more appropriate to your delicate taste. (Conseil groaning) (helmet clanking) (whimsical music) (ominous music) (water pouring) - [Male] Seal the airtight doors. Prepare to flood the diving chamber. - [Male] Ay ay, sir. - Count me out. I've changed my mind. (gentle music) - [Professor] Brave Ned was not alone in his fear. We were men moving underwater like amphibians. It seemed an impossibility. But fear was soon replaced by wonder. At last, men could properly explore the secrets of the ocean. There, revealed to us, was a splendor we never expected to witness, the kingdom of coral. Man has moved into another dimension. This was Captain Nemo's garden. Its natural treasures were like flowers you felt no compulsion to pick. Only the enigmatic Captain Nemo could leave behind a priceless pearl knowing its secretions could increase its beauty every day. Whether his course on Earth had been evil or otherwise, Captain Nemo had trapped the ocean's secrets and he respected them. And Nemo was bringing us into contact with creatures unknown to those of us who study the sea, as well as creatures we knew and feared all too well. It was a shark. (whimsical music) And now it had spotted more vulnerable query. (ominous music) (gentle music) (spear firing) (ominous music) (woman gasping) (mysterious music) (woman screams) Heavens to Neptune, girl, the menace has been dealt with. - But who are you? - [Nemo] We are friends. - Monsters, who are you? What are you doing here? - More to the point, what are you doing here? - This is my territory to dive for pearls. - These waters are infested with sharks. You'll not survive long. - Now he tells us. - But I must. If I don't, my people will starve. (gentle music) (woman gasps) What a treasure. - Ahoy, a dugang, the mermaid of legend. What a prize she'll make. - No, stop. - Ah, and what was that for? (water splashing) - Dugang's have all but disappeared, hunted out of existence. I'll not have you killing so rare an animal. - Your pearls. - No, it is for you and your people. - You cannot mean that. - May its profit keep you out of the sea and safe from sharks. (gentle music) - The sea can never be safe from sharks. - Or men it would seem. - Ow! I'll never understand that madman. We were supposed to be hunting. - But not for creatures which are disappearing altogether from the face of the Earth. - These poor fugitives must be protected. - How could a man like Nemo care about that? - He is a fugitive. He roams the sea like an endangered species himself. Where can it end? - I don't know where but I'd like to know when. - [Professor] Months went by and still, Ned's question remained unanswered. Captain Nemo traveled on and on, never venturing near mainland spurred by a secret hatred which never diminished. For Ned Land, this miracle of engineering beneath the ocean was simply a cage which could barely contain him. - How much longer can this insane nomad keep us prisoners? (ominous music) - Monsieur Ned, you must contain yourself. - Go to the galley Ned, eat. Food can be a comfort. - It is October and still we are trapped. If I eat another fish, I'll grow scales. - We have our studies, but for Ned, the days seem endless. - By the time Christmas falls, we will have escaped and that's a promise. I'll not have fish for Christmas lunch, I'll not. - [Professor] Do my eyes deceive me? - Land! And on Christmas day! - And there is our gift, a tropical island. - Wahoo! I'll have pork cutlets for lunch if it kills me. (ominous music) - Excuse me, captain, if I may interrupt. - We want to celebrate Christmas. - We wondered, captain, if we could simply touch land this very special day. - Indulge your sentiments if you must, but no tricks. Stay in view there on the beach. - Certainly, captain, your graciousness. Absolutely, your worshipful, your wonderfulness. - Enjoy yourself, Mr. Land. ♪ Deck the halls with boughs of holly ♪ ♪ Falalalala lalalala ♪ 'Tis the season to be jolly ♪ Falalalala lalalalala (birds squawking) - I imagine you wish to start hunting lunch, Ned. - Yes indeedy, professor. But yohoho, first I'll have another drink. - Temperance, Ned. Hunting requires clear senses. - And the captain will be expecting us back before long. - Back? There? Never. Yo ho ho and I'll have another drink. - [Conseil] Look, a wild hog. - Start the fire, our cutlets are as good as sizzling. (hog snorting) (trees rustling) (hog snorting) - Yo ho ho. (frog croaking) - Yo ho ho and you'll have another drink, hmm? - Hmph. - I think I have found our lunch. - Well blow me down, I suppose I'll have to congratulate you on the kill then, lad. - Oh I did not kill it. I simply scooped the bird from the ground. It seemed groggy from eating these. - Well yo ho ho and blow me down, I do believe it is drunk from gouging on nutmeg. (professor laughs) Now we have two inebriates to deal with. - Hmph, that's enough of your sarcasm. - But dear Ned, we must keep our wits about us in a strange place. - Don't worry about me. We're escaping and we're escaping now. - But Ned, my good friend, I think a small island would be as much a prison to us as the Nautilus is to you. - And I must continue my studies. - Then lads, I'll just have to say, well I'll miss you and I wish you well. - If it must be. - Farewell, friend. (gentle sad music) (birds squeaking) (whimsical music) (Ned laughs) (birds squeaking) ♪ Deck the halls with boughs of holly ♪ ♪ Falalalala lalalala ♪ 'Tis the season to be jolly (Ned gasps) (Ned gulping) (spear striking tree) Oh we, old Nemo's fire water sure packs a wallop. (spear striking tree) Savages, headhunters! (water splashing) Help! (group of men yelling) - Run Ned, run! - But have you got the bird? - Forget the drunken bird. - I'll not leave my Christmas lunch. (adventurous music) (bird squeaking) Got ya! (group of men yelling) (tribal music) Row lads, row. (tribal music) (group of men yelling) (spears flying) (tribal music) (doors opening) (bird squeaking) (group of men yelling) We must shut the hatch. (tribal music) This infernal modern miracle will be the death of us. - We can't close the hatch. (electricity zapping) (men yelling) (gentle music) - [Conseil] The sea air has sobered the bird. - And this may sober the man. (Ned yelling) (electricity zapping) (gentle music) It is a simple current of my own devising, harmless enough but effective. - No, no, no, no, no, no. - Ned, are you injured? - Worse than injured, much worse, I'm safe and sound on the wretched Nautilus yet again. - The sea brought you and is welcome to take you back. - We want land, man, land. - Oh no, you'll not get that. - Take us to the mainland, any mainland. - Impossible, out of the question. So I suggest you cool off. - I'm going to bed. I plan to sleep a useless life away. I'll not see you till new year. (gentle music) - Did you sleep well, professor? - Yes, thank you, Conseil. (Ned sighing) - [Conseil] Good morning, Ned. - I hope it's good. Have we entered the new year yet? - I'm sorry, Master Ned. - Alas Ned, it is merely December 26. - And what fresh hell is this? - Breakfast compliments of Captain Nemo. - Now there's something to arouse my suspicions. - And there Ned is something to arouse your appetite. - Right, professor and my appetite always wins. - Eat well gentlemen, because you are hereby confined to cabin until further notice. - May I inquire why, Captain? - You need only know I have matters to attend to. (ominous music) - Well, there is, how you say, a pretty kettle of fish. - This fish is no longer pretty to me. - I cannot imagine why eating breakfast is taking such a toll. - Or what dangerous activity the villainous captain might be planning. - I have never been more tired in my... - Our food has been laced with a powerful sleeping potion. (men snoring) Oh no, we are approaching a ship. (professor collapses to the floor) (cannons firing) (adventurous music) (men snoring) - Wake up. Professor, professor, I must have your attention! - It was not enough to lock us up, was it, captain, you had to lace our food with- - Yes, sleeping potion. But tell me one thing, do you have any doctoring experience? - I, I had to study medicine before becoming a professor, yes. - One of my men has been badly hurt. - How? - That does not concern you. He needs immediate attention. He is beyond my help. (dramatic dark organ music) - The maniac is losing his grip. - He seems to be taking the sailor's death badly. (dramatic dark organ music) - I feel that my eardrums could burst. - This is deeper than we've ever been before. - What can be his reason for going down so far? - We must find out and we must finally demand to be taken to freedom. - I'm afraid you're right. This latest excursion is far too extreme. (captain laughing) - The rocks have us but not for long. And you here, what do you want? (clears throat) - Captain, I must demand freedom for my companions. (mysterious music) - Demand? Freedom? When I am about to show you, professor, the only truly civilized continent? - Sir, I have my studies, my fascination for marine life, but it is otherwise for Ned Land. For him, this is slavery. - Give it any name you please. It is not for my pleasure I keep you here. - Then take us back to the surface. Why can't you free Ned at least? - Whoever enters the Nautilus can never quit it except in the manner you are about to witness. (dark music) - [Conseil] What made him come here for a funeral? - [Ned] Lads, I'm going to find out. - Curiosity can kill more than cats, Ned. Do take care. - Round to the observation window. I want to watch this. Conseil, it is what I secretly dreamed it might be. - But can it really be true? (gentle music) - [Professor] It is the lost continent of Atlantis. - [Conseil] Crabs, and of such a size, titanic. - But do you see how they allow passage as if sensing this to be a burial ritual? (dark music) They are returning, but where is Ned? - Perhaps he prefers the lost continent to his confinement here. - Never, not while he still has hopes of once again drinking at a tavern in San Francisco. (ominous music) (claws clanging) - Where is your foolish companion? - He's not here, captain. - All power to surface! (dark music) - Please captain, no. - Return to your cabin! - But our companion, he's not aboard yet. (ominous music) - Here's our target, lads. - But the captain is already so angry with us. - And if he caught us in his own cabin. - He must keep his navigation maps here somewhere. - But what do you gain from knowing the course he plans? - From that I can plan my escape. - [Conseil] Here they are. - [Professor] Here is history, Nemo's chartered course for Atlantis. - [Ned] But this excites me more, lads. It points that dryer parts. - His next course is for the seas of Norway. - What are these two names? - One is a shipwreck called the Avenger and another a ship called the Conqueror. - Not a wreck yet, but obviously planned as one. - How do you know? - Nemo has marked it with a black flag. - The ship has enough problems without Nemo's black flag. Norwegian waters at this time of year are notoriously treacherous. - Shh. - What is it, lad? - The door. (door creaking) Oh, I thought it was the captain. - Thank heaven it is not. - But gentlemen, it is. (ominous music) (Conseil gasping) - Murderer! We know of you plans for the Conqueror. - All the more reason then to lock you up properly this time. (Ned grunting) (dark music) - What is it that compels you to destroy these ships? - A hatred no men could comprehend. - But how is such hatred born? - When a man loses everything, that's how. When a man loses children, wife, father, mother and country. - You lost all this on the Avenger? - I did and now the ship that sunk us shall pay its dues. The Conqueror shall die. - You not do this, you mustn't. (captain laughing) - But I will. - We are rising. I can only dread what awaits us at surface. - We must try to reach the Conqueror. We must try to save it. - Ned, we cannot even escape our cabin. - Yes we can. I've hidden a weapon, small, but perhaps enough to save an unsuspecting ship. - Ned, you are a resourceful man indeed. (metal clanking) I'm going on deck. (ominous music) - Tighten that rope. Do as I say, lash me down. I want to face this one as she sinks. Now, go below. (ominous music) (thunder clapping) (dramatic music) - Captain, this is madness. All the slaughter in the world will not cause the Avenger to rise again. - I want this ship destroyed and I want to watch it happen. - These are not the same people as those who sunk the Avenger. - It is the same ship. It must pay its debts. - I'm going to put a stop to this maniac for once and all. - No Ned, no. (dramatic music) - He must be stopped now. (ominous music) Let me back up there. Let me at him. - Kill him Ned and you become part of his evil. - All right, but then we must try to reach the Conqueror. - How? - By boat. - We cannot. Nemo would see us. - You're right. He'll blast us out of the water. - I would rather go down with the Conqueror than live with the stench of evil here. (ominous music) (whimsical music) (ominous music) (doors opening) - Stop where you are. - [Ned] You stop where you are. (ominous music) (dramatic music) (cannons firing) - We surely cannot make it. - Yes, we can. Look, there's worse yet. (ominous music) (birds squawking) - It seems the storm had blown us ashore. I know not how. I only know that my worthy companions and I traveled 20,000 leagues and we traveled them under the sea. I can only hope that future progress will lead the way to a proper comprehension of Captain Nemo's miraculous underwater ship. There, valois, at last it is finished. - The end. - [Ned] But is it? - Is it what, Ned? - Finished? Do we know what became of the Nautilus? - And the what of Captain Nemo? Is he dead and gone? (gentle music) - We can't know. Perhaps he's still out there roving the depths, seeking to take revenge on the rest of mankind. (gentle music) (adventurous music)
