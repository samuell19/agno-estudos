starring editor music by director of photography produced by written & directed by Good evening. Please come inside. Have a seat. I need to get dressed. Wait. Just spit it out. We keep searching. We don't know where he is. We were really lucky. More than thirty men worked there. Most importantly, they don't have kids. - Where is Sikora? - In his office. I can't fucking wait... One sec. Call you back. This is Mr Sikora, the deputy manager. Good morning, God bless you. Magda, this way, please. CRISIS TEAM OFFICE This is the crisis team. We won't bother them. Would you like some water or juice? - We are here, he's probably out there. - How do you know that? That's where his mining team saw him for the last time. He can't have moved anywhere else. So he's alive? Magda... Someone from the mine will take care of you now. We have a special room for the family. A car with a driver. We'll manage all your matters. Excuse me. - Where were you last night? - In the office. Two minutes before the tremor, that is at 0:10, someone called you at your office phone. Don't fucking cover for him. Tell us what you know. - Did he go down? - If he clocked in, he did. Some collect a methanometer, clock in, and never go down. Not him. Let's go to my office. Magda, who should we inform? He's got no one else but me. At 0:10, you were at my place. Is it possible he didn't go down? He did go down. People saw him underground. Eat something. You'd better think what you're going to tell him. The face is the most dangerous area in the mine, right? It was the only area Oskar was assigned to. They'll prove you sent him there. And you knew about it. Did I know what the face was? Back then, I was focused on the arse. - Anything else? - No, thank you. These tiles are really nice. It looked level. Looks aren't everything. They closed my bus stop. Hi! Hi. - And? - Will you give me a lift? I have a job interview in an hour. I've just mixed a bucket of glue. - Call a taxi. - But it's far. I can give you a lift. Have to go to my dad's anyway. Can you? There! You gonna be fine? I guess so. - Fancy a cig? - I don't smoke. Sorry. Are you pregnant? No. I just quit. Do you remember that? You still have it in the car? Do you know his father isn't really his father? Then who? A stepfather. Well, yeah. You knew? We've never talked about it before. About what? Just a little bit. It's not so obvious. He's a stranger after all. What if we adopted a boy? Would I be a stranger to him? - Shall I feed you? - There's too much. The fridge needs defrosting, we must tuck in the grub. I didn't understand a word you said. - Were the lights on? - I don't remember. Were they on or not? A man would hit someone in the face, not send signs. Move on! In fours! On your knees! We checked the drift. Can't go further than the 30th metre. There's a rockslide. You have to clear the rubble by hand and build a rescue tunnel. What about the atmosphere? Close to the explosion triangle. You can't fucking breathe. Tell them to go back. Get back! Ventilate the workings. And? His team mate saw him on T-707. - It's right here. - What time was it? He wandered off 30 minutes before the tremor. Let's find him. The arch timbering and the net protect us. The highest pressure is where the coal is mined. Here's an intact working section. And here's a collapsed one. How long is the rockslide? We don't know that. Where do you think he might hide? There are special zones resistant to pressure of a few hundred tons. Very safe places to be. There are two exits in the wall and only one in the face. So how long is it going to take? This clearing... Magda, we can't accurately assess it. And just a ballpark figure? How many hours? Days? Is he going to spend a week there? There's another option. We can drill a borehole and lower down a capsule. We'll keep him alive until we get to him through the drift. That's the fastest solution. I want to talk to the General Manager. I won't leave this room until you tell me everything. - Look... - Need to talk to the GM. I don't want to hear anything from you. Should I tell her we've got out-of-date German maps? Tell her we don't have machines precise enough. But the refinery guys do. A simple drill bit can get screwed up in the wall. - Will you hit this desk from one km? - They did in Chile. After six attempts. From 500 metres. Why the hell did you tell her that? Above the rockslide, there might be a road, a hospital or fuck knows what. Tomorrow, we'll make a test drill, okay? Tomorrow, for fuck's sake. That's too late! He can't wait! Neither can she. - ...Let us do our job now. - I want to understand... Just fucking take her out of here. - ...Let us work, please. - Am I bothering you? I want to see what you're doing. Do I have the right to do it? I want to go where we always went. I've got to go back! You hear me? Fuck... You wanna stay here until midnight? What the fuck are you looking for? Fuck me... Magda! I will get him out. If the borehole happened to be located under that house, you'd have blown it up, right? - Take a look... - Hello. Take a look. See? He's walking just like him. He looks just like him. And he's wearing his jacket. Pause! Here. Can you zoom in, please? He's walking around the shop, not buying anything. But he leaves in no hurry, right? No need to if they stopped me at the tills! Did you call him? Excuse me. I've got CCTV in here, sure. I saw him go down the mine. He can't have left without being seen. How often did you come to my place while officially being underground? So where is he now? You're scared to think he might stand right here and face you. Yeah, just go away. Just go! He's already achieved one goal. Maybe he even caused the cave-in? You'd rather he'd gone down, right? It would solve all your problems. And what's gonna happen now? Tell me, Kacper. Do you love me? Fuck you. You go fuck yourself! I had my suitcases packed! You know what I thought when I saw you? That you came to take me to your place! LAUNDRY SERVICE: one motorcycle jacket TRAINING DEPARTMENT My father works for a Czech mine. There are more Poles than Czechs. The Czechs don't want to work for the mine. Safety standards were lowered for profit. - My father... - More people than jobs. ...told terrifying stories. Hey, gentlemen! Shall I send you invitations? You think you've passed? Aye, sure thing! - Let me sign it. - Here. Thank you. Good luck! - Goodbye! - From now on, we say "God bless you!" You blocked it? Let's unload it! The boss is coming! Work harder! God bless you! God bless you! What is it? I missed the quota. Why? The wire got fucked up and we're two hours behind. Did you report it? Cut him some fucking slack. - What? - We'll hurry up and won't report it. You don't owe me anything. Do your job and go home. Hey! Come to our place tonight. We'll be waiting for you. What do you get when you throw a piano... ...down a mine shaft? A flat miner. Flat. Miner. That's a perfect death. I'd rather know it was the end. To get ready. It's nice to grow old. Like your parents. Does it matter at all how you die? One moment and it's over. Who's got a light? Those who stay behind get the worst of it. Amen! Hey, mate! A bit of Physical Education. Were you up or down? - Honey... - What's this? Mind the neighbours... He really has lung problems. Hold it. Were you up or down? Lie down! Here's something for your safety... Legs! Hold them still! Let's go! Jesus... I'm so happy you two are here for me. My great mate, you're gonna make it. Cut it out, will you? Don't you like it when a man is pissed? I do. Jesus... An underground foreman. Bottoms up. He's a bottom foreman! You okay? - Now he looks dignified. - Magda... He must be dreaming about you. Forgot to serve the cake. One for the road. You were wearing a white dress. It was almost dawn. You should go. You gave me a head start. Please... I'm hungover. See ya! Wait... Hey! Why didn't you even say hi? I didn't even say hi to him. Coming! - Hi. - You've got the wrong house. You want me to leave? No, no. Come in. - You could've called me. - Are you busy or what? It's about Magda. I need to talk. All right. Have a seat. I'll get the glasses. What's this? The money I owed you. Thanks. You needn't have. You know anyone who'd want to learn English? - Extra lessons or a course? - I can ask around. She can't sit still. If she had something to do, she'd feel needed. I've got a number of my dad's friend. Her daughter will be taking final exams in English. So maybe she can... "Oskar is here." She said that school would reply this Thursday. - Can't find the number. - Yeah, and last Thursday too. - I'll get the door. - No, let me do it. A family reunion. What are you doing here? Looking for you. And you've found him! Come on in. You were supposed to be at the swimming pool. Are you following me? I called him. - We want to talk. - Sorry, I'll just... I was worried. But I'm fine. Gotta go. I can see I've ruined your party. - Are you coming or going? - I'm just... Bye! What's going on? You got a guilty conscience? I didn't go to Kacper's place by chance. You hear me? You're stupid. Is that what you really want? I've got a lot to lose. Too much. Magda... I won't give up. Today, blasting works are planned in this area. Jakubik, you will handle that. Stasiek, you will cover Level 850. "Come to my place" The best for the best. Oskar, 707. 707 already stinks of your piss. Thank you! God bless you! You coming? God bless you! Why the fuck didn't you go down? Forgot to leave my cigs. I'll take them. You're not going down? The boss called me in. Oskar! You need an email to go down? God bless you! - Hello? - This is the dispatcher. Yes, hello? There's been a tremor. The power and phones are out. No contact with our men. - Where? - On 707. The sensors are going up. Something got fucked up. Hello? - Hello? - Are the rescuers on their way? They had to move back from the shaft. - You going already? - Got a call from the mine. - Stay for a minute. - I have to go. - No, no... - Magda, please. Come here. Please. Please, oh please. I don't want them to know... We want them to know. ...that I'm here. I'll come back when I can. I love you! Mates, get your cards ready! No problem... Kacper, don't go in there. Wait, where's your card? Kacper, stay away. - Where's Oskar? - Don't know. - Have you seen Oskar? - No. You'll find out soon. Go get dressed. - Where's Oskar? - Isn't he up? - Wasn't he with you? - We worked on 707. Then, I didn't see him. Bloody fuck. Guys, go and tell his wife. I'll go. - You'd rather go alone? - Yes. Pull it up! This is a difficult operation. We can't really say when the drilling will be over. We don't know what dangers we might expect. Do you know when and if you will find him? We always search for a man who's alive. This situation is no different. Good morning. Please, get in. Kacper couldn't make it? He's got more urgent things to do. You can see we're doing what we can to save him. Formation pressure? Yes. Probably methane. You fucked something up again? What's going on? The drill bit was blown back up by methane. - How much time do you need? - Twenty minutes to repair it. I told you I'd call you when I had any news. I wanted to know what was going on. And now I know. Wait a second. What is it? Send me down. It's not fucking atonement but a rescue operation. Get the fuck out of here. Just so that nobody regrets it. Yeah, go ahead. Sure, like I said. Here, hold it! Shit... Let's fucking move on! Mates! Can't you hear the creaks?! It's gonna fall on your heads! They say it's gonna collapse! - We gotta secure that. - No fucking way! Let's go! - It's gonna collapse. - What is? Let's go! - What? - Methane. Kacper! What? Boss, methane got the fuck out. Mates, get the fuck outta here. Get me the box. Let's go! I won't leave you here. Let's go. - Fuck... - Come on. This is not a joke. We can't dig the tunnel. There's only one way to get to him. We'll know everything by tomorrow. Stop! A little lower! Can't hear you! Lower! - The borehole ends here. - Shit... Hold on! Pull it up a little! Hold on! There! The borehole! Stop! See? It's blocked by the ring. This is the fucking ring. Switch it off! - That's the reinforcement mesh! - And these are actuators. That's right. Mates, we've got him! We got there! Oskar! Rescue base to Oskar. Say something if you hear us. Magda, wait. He's not replying because he might be asleep. He might be too weak. Or even unconscious. We'll keep calling him. The iron pipe sends sound like a bridge. He will hear us if he's there. If he's asleep, he'll wake up when he hears a familiar voice. I'd like to be alone, please. Oskar, this is Magda. Say something if you hear me. Oskar, say something, please. Oskar, can you hear me? Oskar... Oskar... Oskar, please, say something. Oskar... Give it to her. Oskar, please, say something. Oskar, please, say something. Oskar... Oskar... Please, say something. He's not reacting even to the familiar voice. I'll be calling him now. Oskar, this is Kacper. Help is coming. Over. Rescue base to Oskar. Help is coming. Over. Help is coming. Over. Rescue base to Oskar. Help is coming. Over. You're not going home? Why? Am I bothering you? Why the fuck did I listen to you? He could've stayed in the office until now. How he thanked me every time he saw me... He said one bottle of vodka wasn't enough. You heard that? And I was such a fool to say: "Thank Kacper." Rescue base to Oskar. Say something if you can hear me. Rats. Repeat! Two hits! Oskar! Two hits! Fuck me... Once again! Oskar! Two hits! There were two. Fuck me, he's alive! It's impossible. We've got it! Oskar, we want to hear you. Two hits! Three hits! Hell, yeah! We got to you through a rescue borehole drilled from the surface. I repeat: from the surface. Help is coming. We keep digging underground. We're coming to get you, mate. But it will take a while. So we've lowered a rescue capsule for you. There's some booze... ...meds and food. We'll keep you alive until we get to you underground. Do you copy? Mate, I need to localize you. Do you know where you are? Where are you? Give me the map. T-707? T-12? T-404? You went far! Oskar! You must go to the intersection of Wall 7 and Drift 7. Wall 7 and Drift 7. There's a microphone we're using. The booze, meds, and food are waiting for you there. Fuck me... He got far, eh? We have to tell everyone. Let him get there first. Oskar, are you there? Oskar, are you there? Give us a signal you can get to the intersection. Can you get to the intersection? There are meds, water, food. Give us a signal. Can't he? If you cannot get there, hit the pipe twice. I repeat: if you cannot get there, hit the pipe twice. Bloody fuck. Oskar, are you cut off? Did the drift collapse? Can you clear the rubble? I repeat: can you clear the rubble? You must clear the rubble and get to the intersection. The rescue capsule is there. Just clear the rubble. We need another borehole closer to him. Call the minister. Go on! Wake him up! - Call the fuck... - He won't survive another ten days! Then what? Oskar! Calm down. Everything's gonna be fine, mate. We're doing what we can. Let us think. Everything's gonna be fine. He knows. We have to lie. He knows the seam and our digging possibilities. He knows we can't make it in time. He must fight. Is he supposed to die there because we can't help him? - Should I fucking tell him that? - No need to. Oskar, we've got a decision. We're drilling a borehole closer to your location. It's gonna be fine. Just hang on. You're gonna make it! We'll be here for you. Tell him that. He already knows everything. This is your tenth day underground. Another borehole would take ten more days. The underground tunnel is dug by hand. It will take one month to get to you. Oskar, I can't get you out. I repeat: I cannot get you out. Do you copy? Oskar... I'm not able to help you. Bring Magda here. You hear me? Oskar, I'll bring Magda here so that you can talk. I'll bring your wife Magda here. I don't understand! He doesn't want anyone to know. Kacper! Kacper! Kacper! You want the reporters to hover around this place? What about her? Did you think about her? You want her to die with him by the mic for the next two weeks? Is that what you want for her? What about the others? Who the fuck's gonna go down after something like that? He knows what he asks for. Nobody can find out about it, get it? We will know! There's no other option. I know you're scared. I'm scared too. But you can't show him that. Because now he's the one who's scared. And you must help him get through this. It's nearly dawn. We don't have much time because the new shift is coming. Then we will disconnect and stay out. Oskar... I will take care of your wife. Not only now but forever. Oskar, it's me. Please listen to what I've got to tell you. Can you hear me? I didn't know... I didn't understand... So many years... But I didn't know anything about you two. For the final time... Oskar... Thank you. Don't wait for me. So, was there anything? He would have replied by now. We've been trying really hard. Oskar, this is Magda. Can you hear me? Oskar, it's me, Magda. Can you hear me? Please, say something. Oskar, love, I'm here. I'll never leave you again. Give me a signal if you can hear me. written & directed by director of photography editor music by produced by Subtitle translation by Magdalena Cedro
