Martin? What's going on Martin? Are you not in school? Hello? - How's it going Muriel? - I'm fine. Tired, but fine. - Excuse me. - Not at all. Not easy, is it? No. Both suit you really well. I think I'm going to go with this one. Alright, why not? Please, take it. It will give me more time to think. Thank you. Hello? Martin, where are you? Can you hear me? Hold on, I don't understand. Alright Martin, enough, very funny. What? What are you talking about? No, wait. Hang on. You tell my son that's enough. I'm trying to work here. Put my son on. And why would I believe you? Put my son on. No, wait... Hi, it's Martin. Please leave a message. It's Martin's mum. Could you call me back, please? Don't hurt him, that's all I ask. I haven't told anyone. I haven't phoned the police. I'm trying to get the money, but it's a lot. Anyway, call me back. We'll find a way. I'm willing to sell my shop, but it's not easy in such a short space of time. Phone me back. I've got 30,000 euros in the bank, but I'll get my hands on the rest. Just don't hurt him, please. Can you phone me back? Did you fix it? Are you sure it works? We can't do without it. Try it. Here you go. Just one is enough. Here. What's your problem? 100 is enough. I'm not a beggar, OK? Keep your hair on, mate. You're lucky. I'm in a good mood today. What did she tell you? And what did you tell her? I told her, "My love, my love." We need those 200,000 euros. I've got a little over 30,000 in the bank. What about you? Me? What do you think I've got? I've got nothing. No money set aside? What do you think? I've got two kids. If I had the money you'd have it in a heartbeat. Same goes for me. Such a handsome boy. You need to phone the police, Muriel. He might be right. I'll pay. I'll get the money and I'll pay. I'm not telling anyone. I'm just an employee here. I don't own anything. I wasn't like you. I wasted it all. Would your bank not lend it to you? Business is good, right? 170,000 euros in two days? - It is a lot. - And you have no idea who it is? WHY DON'T YOU ROB A JEWELLER'S? Excuse me. So he knows who you are. Big deal! Our faces were in all the papers. The bastard must think you're loaded. Look, don't worry about the money. I'll sort it, alright? I told you, don't worry. Go back to work if you can. This will all be over by tomorrow. Hi dad. Are you going out? Where's your sister? She has judo on Tuesdays. Where's dad going? To see a customer. Did you have a fight? Can I watch TV? I don't have school until 10 tomorrow. Finish your homework. Do you see that guy in the suit? Will we have enough to leave soon? Yes, don't worry. - Evening. - Evening. Can I get something? All good? F**k! Give me your weapons. Do you know who you're talking to? Yes, I'm so scared. Come on, hurry up. Right, here you go. You too. And the third, come on. Now the cash. - Give him the cash. - Go on. Hey, take it easy. Bloody hell! It's François. I'd love it if we could meet up. No, I'm not far, just down the street. F**k me, it's cold. What do you want? Big win on the horses tonight? It was a three-way bet. Long shots? That's right. How much is there? I don't know, take it. You can count it yourself. BOUCHES-DU-RHÔNE SAVINGS BANK There you go. I'll leave you to it, Mr Giacalone. Thank you. It's short by about a third. Is that OK? Yeah. Thank you, François. With this you should have enough. I thought you were skint? Thank you, René. Yes. Yes. Location W... Alright. 3.59 pm, I'll be there. Excuse me, are you going to buy a ticket? No. Can't you see? I'm buying a salad. Are you in a hurry? I am actually. - Where are you going? - Nice. What are you going there for? - Window or aisle? - Window. I've got a job interview with the council. A job interview with the council... First or second class? Second class. Yes, with Nice city council. There's a bar near there called Le Grand Dormeur. Go there and tell the owner René sent you. He might come in handy. Enter your PIN. This is legit what I'm saying. René from Marseille, the fixer. If you say, 'the fixer', he'll understand. Alright, see you. Thank you. Yes, I'm here. Where are you? Damn it. That wasn't the plan! Was that him? What did he want? The location is now Place aux Huiles. - In Marseilles? - Yes, in the car park. What is his bloody game? Marseille, Place aux Huiles. The car park. We're going to be chasing him about all day. Hello? Where is that? - Martin's there. Can you see him? - Yeah, I see him. What about the money? No idea, I'm totally lost in all this. HOSPITAL Right, I'll call you back. We need to stop... ...seeing each other. We can't see each other any more. I want to be left alone. I don't need you any more, so I don't want to see you. I didn't know how to tell you. Thank you. For everything. But I don't want to see you any more. Who were you phoning? Cut it out! Why were you on the phone? Get out of here! Beat it! I mean it! Get out of here! I've put everything away upstairs. Is it alright if I go? Call me if you need anything. See you tomorrow. - I need an ambulance. - What's the matter? There's a woman. She's collapsed in her shop. Sometimes I think suicide should carry the same punishment as murder. I should charge you with attempted murder, just as I should charge you with concealing information. I don't know anything. It still seems odd to me. The marks around your son's wrists and ankles. What should I make of that? What do you want? A guy was walking past your shop and saw you lying on the floor. He took out his mobile and phoned for an ambulance, only he phoned from your son's mobile. Who is he? What was he doing outside your shop? If I were to start piecing things together - those marks on your son, the large sum of money you withdrew from the bank - I'd be entitled to think this was a ransom demand. Was it a ransom demand? What went wrong? What happened? Who did this? If I knew, I know what I'd do. I'd kill them. Don't move! Does this mean anything to you? That's what my dad used to call me. Did he ever tell you that? Answer me! - Are you Marc Agostini's girl? - Yeah. Don't do this! You're at it again, aren't you? Is that where the money came from? And that car? I don't want you doing this again. - Are the girls out? - They'll be back soon. I don't want to lose you. What do you think of the car? Not bad, eh? Do you like it? Let's take it for a drive. I'm not here right now. Leave me a message and I'll call you back. It's François. I wanted... How are things? If you need anything, just phone me, alright? Talk to you. Alright, how's it going? Is that yours? Jealous? Do they not do a men's version? Could I have a bottle of the same, please? Have you seen her? No. Me neither. I've left at least ten messages, but no reply. Are you scared she'll do something stupid again? Aren't you? If she really wants to, what can we do? - Do you know Jo? - Jo who? Jo from The Biribi in Le Panier. - Yeah. - It was me who set up his bingo. Do you know how much money it makes? 3,000 a week. A quarter for you, that's 750 euros in your pocket. I'll have a think. We'll see. He's having a think. That means it's in the bag. Does that bring in much? A decent amount. So that's where your money is from. What is this, a lecture? She's been disappearing for more than 15 years now. She comes back and then what? I have to give up all my savings? For what? For friendship? Memories? Let me tell you what I remember. I remember the noise that day in that car park. We both jumped out of our skins sitting there in the car. Were we not supposed to be using toy guns? Where did that bullet come from? And why doesn't she just tell the cops everything now? Should I not have come? I'm worried about you. Don't be. Can I give you a hand? No, you'll get your suit dirty. These boxes are full of dust. Did you notice? I bought it yesterday. It's for you. Shall we go for a stroll? No. Look, François, I don't want you coming round here, even if it is kind of you. You don't need us any more, that's normal. What's normal? Nothing is normal. Nothing. Some guy killed my son right in front of me. Is that normal? Nothing is normal. But that same guy saved my life. He saved my life. He phoned for an ambulance on Martin's mobile. He kills my son, then he saves my life. He was outside the shop. Come with me. Let's go for a stroll around our neighbourhood, where we belong. How does that sound? Will you come with me? Hello, Solange. Do I know you? I'm Muriel. Doesn't ring any bells. Have we changed so much? Remember the fur coats? - What coats? - We robbed a lorry. We were giving out fur coats to the whole neighbourhood. All the local women were wearing mink, including you. I don't remember that. She doesn't remember. We were gods. Do you remember? Everyone around here was applauding us. Are you selling fur coats? Is that why you're here? We're here to see Henri. Thank you. Can he still use the stairs? Not so much any more. How old is he now? I don't know. Henri. It's François. I'm here with Muriel. We thought we'd come and say hello. Do you remember us? Why wouldn't I remember you? It's been a long time. Not long enough for me to forget that you used to kiss me, Muriel. I heard about your son. It's sad because he was young. But you're still young too. I've lost three. But they had the time to live their lives and I had the time to start growing old. That changes a lot of things. Death is like a game to young people. It doesn't frighten them. They don't fear anyone. It's only later that death becomes more of a serious issue. When you can feel its presence all around you, lurking, persistent. I'm used to it now. We're old friends. We play hide and seek together. But I know that, one day, death will find me. I don't think I have any compassion for this world any more or for the people who live in it, starting with myself. Has something happened to René? No, he's working. I told him not to blow it all, but he went and did it anyway. - How's the perfume shop doing? - Good. And do you still have your boat business? Yes. It's all revenge, revenge, revenge. There's nothing I like less than revenge. We can help you. No, François. Did you ever love me? I've thought about it a lot and I think the answer is no. But that never stood in our way before. Why should it stand in our way now? Go home, François. I love you. We're too old now to play this game without getting hurt. I'm going to leave my wife. I don't love her. Not any more. But I still love you. She's waiting for you. I'm not. I'm going to leave her. That's your choice, but don't do it for me. I want to believe that you are somewhere else and that we'll see each other again. But I know that you're dead. I've lost you forever. We'll never see each other again. He killed him for nothing. Why not kill him right away? Why demand the money? Because he's a madman. You can't expect logic from a madman. - Pull over. - Where? Here. Wait here, I'll be two seconds. It's closed. It's closed. Come back later. What was that all about? I had two bingos. The new owner ditched them and agreed a deal with a new crew. That's not right. That's what I was saying to him there. I think he got the message. Yeah, I think he did. René? What if we did another job? We were the best, weren't we? Hello. Can I have a go too? How much is she? I've got the money now. No, you can't. I'm fine with strangers, but not friends. That's just how it is. Are you jealous? That's just how it is. Have your drink. Muriel... She can't manage on her own. We need to find this guy. So that... So that she can see him, so she can touch him. Because otherwise... Why aren't you saying anything? No reason. I'm happy we're back together, all three of us. After all that time, just like before. I was even thinking that... How old was that guy? - Who, the jeweller? - About 50 or so? He'd be dead now regardless. If we hadn't killed him then, it's likely he'd be dead by now anyway. I didn't kill anyone. And neither did you. It was her. I love your new suit. Sorry it's all dirty now. I want my money by tomorrow, or I'll kill your wife and kids. Got it? - Do you hear me? I'll do it. - He's deaf. He is old, right enough. Tomorrow night, here. You'll be with your pals soon. You wanted to kill children? My children? Hold on. Not too loud for you? Safe travels, boys! You've been busy. How many have you got? I've got quite a few now. I'll bet you have. You've got it made. All you do is set it up and watch the money roll in. I do have to go collect it. What is it you're watching? I don't know. Is this alright? Would you mind if we had a chat? Not at all. I want to talk. There are plenty of things for us to talk about: politics, the weather, football... I don't have much of an imagination. I never normally drink beer, but I really like it. Yeah, I really like beer too. I like going into a bar and having a beer. Do you come here often? Every now and then. What about you? I've never seen you before. You wouldn't have noticed me. Maybe not. Are you from around here? No, not really. I live in Aix-en-Provence. - What about you? - Yes, not far from here. Is this a nice part of the city? It's alright. Do you work? No, hang on. You're a student. No, I work. I studied sales and I work in an office at Fnac. It's hardly the most exciting job, but I like it. I get a pretty good discount as well. The money's good, it's not too tiring. What about you, what do you do? Me? You don't have to say. It's fine, I'm not a secret agent, I can talk. I live in Aix. I'm a teacher. I've got two kids, two girls. I'm divorced. I have them every other week. And as you might have guessed I don't have them right now. There's nothing better... It's a tiring job being a teacher. But I've got a Fnac member's card, so I get discounts as well. - Do you want another? - Sure. Then what do you say we get out of here? Sounds good. I'm not forcing you. It's only if you want to. No, it's not that. Alright. I really like you. Well then. Don't move! What's she doing? - My dad used to call me that. - Are you Marc Agostini's girl? Yeah. Don't do this! He keeps phoning me. Don't worry, Muriel. We'll get him, I told you. Don't do anything stupid. I'll phone René. We'll handle it. Do you think I'm being punished for what happened in that car park? Don't talk rubbish. Look, I'm on my way. I don't care if you go to her. I'll be here tonight. Did you hear what I said? Do you still love her? I really don't know any more. I feel like I'm forcing myself. I'm forcing myself to be in love. To love her. To feel my heart beating. It's been a long time since I heard anything. There's nothing in there. He's not going to phone. He hasn't called since the other night. We're not going to find him. I'm going to give it all up. The shop can go to my assistant. She'll run it as well as I can. It's like I'm not even there any more. What I miss most is having to watch over him. When he was still with me I could never sleep. It's not how things are supposed to be. A mother burying her son. Now I sleep like a log, the whole night through. There's nothing to keep me up. Where are you going? What should we do? Let's wait a bit longer. You know, François, I'm older now than my dad was when he died. He was a street sweeper. And that's how he died: with a brush in his hand, right in front of me. At home he was always sweeping up: inside, outside. I can't pick up a brush without thinking about him. What a funny thing to pass on to your children. What is the point in sweeping? S**t. He went into a small, four-storey block of flats. Maybe 12 flats in total. One of those 12 flats was in the jeweller's name. But he's dead. Yeah. An 11.43 bullet in the head, just like Martin. Did you find him? He lives here with his wife and his two kids. What? I said he lives here with his wife and two kids. You could have told me that before! What were you planning? Will you manage? I can't do that in front of his family. No. François, you need to turn the key twice when you start the car up. That's the safety mechanism. What are we doing? You're going to wait for me. I'll bring him down. Yes. I'm your neighbour. We're going downstairs. Tell your wife you're going for a walk. - No. - What? There's no-one else in. They're out at the cinema. Alright, then let's go. I used to live right there. Do you remember? When I was off sick I'd be too scared to go out onto the balcony in case my teacher saw me. When we went to prison in 1985, a screw came to tell me that my dad had died. We always thought... We never accepted that he had killed himself. That wasn't him, to throw himself out of a window. He didn't jump. He was thrown. Unconscious, beaten black and blue, then thrown from a window on the fifth floor. There were two of them, the screw who told me everything - he might have had a choice, but he was too scared to say no, he was young, he was new - and his boss. They had been paid to do it, by someone on the outside. - Why? - For the money. My father's accomplice disappeared into thin air. I think it was Henri who took care of him. He had got his hands on a lot of money, but my mum and I never saw any of it. A year later the boss quit his job and became a jeweller. It was better paid than being a screw. I'm sorry I dragged you into all of this. He was unarmed. I killed him in cold blood. I knew who it was. I had planned everything. No, don't do this! I think... My parents had had an argument. It was a Wednesday. My mum had gone out and my dad didn't want to leave me home alone. Does this mean anything to you? That's what my dad used to call me. - Are you Marc Agostini's girl? - Yeah. Don't do this! I'd been in your shop a few times with my wife, but we had no idea. Then, one day, I saw your tattoo. I went back to look at newspapers from the time and I found out you'd gone to prison for stealing jewellery. It all came back to me. Did you not see him? I never bought the idea that it was self-defence. You ruined our lives, Muriel. You used us. You made me doubt what I'd seen with my own eyes. That tattoo haunted my dreams and eventually it became unreal, until... I wanted to hurt you. Not just for what you did to my dad, but for what you awakened in me. I couldn't sleep. I thought about it all the time. I couldn't think of anything else. I didn't want anything. All I felt was this growing hatred. I thought it would bring me some comfort doing what I did to you. Making you suffer. Hearing the panic in your voice on the phone. But it didn't have any effect on me. I thought just hearing your fear would be enough. But it wasn't enough. It would never be enough. Seeing the state you were in at the station should have been enough, but it wasn't. In the bar, you were right next to me. I could see with my own eyes what I had done to you. That also should have been enough, but it didn't change anything. It was as though I had done all that for nothing. But how could a person do that for nothing? How could a person kill a kid for nothing? - Let's take him back. - What? Someone needs to put an end to this. No, François! What do you mean, "no"? I've got nothing to lose. What is it to me if I kill some guy? It'd hardly be the first time. You came back, Muriel. I thought my life had meaning again. Something... Why do we live? Why do we do all this? What's the point in any of it? What's the point in me repairing boats? What was the point in me having kids? You die and you're on your own. I thought you would give my life meaning again, that everything would fall into place, like before. That we would go back to being what we were. Young. Beautiful. We would grab life by the scruff of the neck and stay up all night, dancing. All that would have worked if Martin had been my son. Don't you think? René, was he your son? Cut it out, François. Or was he my son? Muriel... Was he my son? Was it my son that this bastard killed? No. You're a liar. Look, he wasn't your son. What good has it done me to love you, Muriel? I don't know, François. Can't you lie to me? Lie to me, for f**k's sake! What was the point in bringing your son into this world? You don't know either. Did you think killing him would give your son's life meaning? Don't leave me, Muriel. Don't f*****g leave me! Excuse me, are you selling tickets? Excuse me, are you selling tickets? Excuse me, are you selling tickets? Excuse me, are you selling tickets? Miss... - Here you go. - Thank you. What are you doing? Have you lost your mind? They didn't catch me. I'll never grow old. How good is that? I'll never grow old. The dead stay young.
