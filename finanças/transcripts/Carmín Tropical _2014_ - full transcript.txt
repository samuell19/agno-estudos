They say your actions and the past always return hand-in-hand. And I say it because having to come back... and explain the things I once did isn't among my priorities. I don't think anyone should be judged for their mistakes, especially when you're not old enough... or are too inexperienced to understand something called life. When... they told me... I could hardly believe it. I thought... they'd made a mistake, that it was a joke... or something. I was asked to identify the body, but it wasn't until I saw her... lying there, dead... It wasn't until then... that I was forced to accept it. How are your mom and dad? In a bad way. They've taken it the hardest. I mean... it's not the kind of thing you say, but... Dani was their favorite and you know it. And then there's the fact... she was going to look after them in their old age. Me and my brothers are married. That's why she was going to stay with them. This is the last photo taken of my daughter, before she was killed. She looked so happy at the time. She said she had a surprise for me, but that she couldn't tell me yet. She was about to get herself a good job. She always used to say, "If they give it to me, Mom... we'll have some extra money... and you can use it for whatever you want. You don't have to answer to me." You know how she used to help me around the house. She was good company. Good morning! Excuse me... I'd like to talk to the chief or the boss... or whoever's in charge of homicides. What can I do for you? I'd like some information on Miss Daniela Quiroz's case. The only one who can give out that kind of information is the Investigations Coordinator, but the Commander isn't here right now and I don't know what time he'll be back. Anyway, you need an appointment. Sorry, hon, but you look fat. Is that what you invited me here for? To tell me I look fat? What should we do? Cancel the snacks? Order a yogurt instead? Go to bed? Excuse me. Don't pay any attention to me. I'm only kidding. You look pretty. Very pretty. As my Uncle Reynaldo would say, death to my enemies! - Cheers! - Cheers! How much is it? Twenty-five. Look at Faraona with her classic cocktails. Listen to you! Who do you think you are coming here and criticizing? She doesn't remember what she was like when she first got here. She didn't know how to dance, or talk, much less sing. She couldn't even carry a fucking tray. Everything would sway... and I mean that in a good way. But look at her now. She's an artist, even without the feathers and the sequins. Shut up! All you talk about is ancient history. But it all came to an end all of a sudden. The day she skipped Juchitán. The little bitch didn't as much as say goodbye. That's gratitude for you! But I get it. I know what it's like having teenage hormones raging in you. Speak for yourself! Hormones had nothing to do with it! And just to be clear, I didn't skip town. I left, which is completely different. No! You fled Juchitán, you didn't leave. Cheers. Tell me about Daniela. A fisherman found her dead. Or at least that's what they say. He saw a car in the early hours. He thought it was a couple of lovebirds, but in the morning he was the first one to see Daniela's body. But has anyone been arrested? Are there any suspects? Rubén Jiménez. Who's he? Rubén works here. He's a stripper. He comes, or should I say, he'd come to give his show, but no charges have been filed. The last time I saw Daniela was the last time I saw everyone, when I had to leave here. I didn't say goodbye to anyone that day, much less Daniela. I left for lots of reasons. Because I wanted a different life, to meet new people, sing at other venues, see the world and feel alive. But the main reason I left, was to be with the man I loved. We found your friend Daniela dead... in the early hours of November 9 in Punta Alacrán. She'd been stabbed 27 times in the back. When was the last time you saw Daniela? When I left here. 10:00 - 11:3012:00 - 12:30 SATURDAYS NO SERVICE Hey! Sir! I remember the night me and Galdino left. We decided to take the first route and go as far as our money would take us, without giving a second thought to anyone or anything. We didn't get very far... or maybe we didn't want to leave our memories behind. I don't know when Daniela discovered what I'd done. I don't even want to know what she thought, how sad she must have been. I never spoke to Daniela again after that. I didn't even dare write her a few words explaining how ashamed, how sorry I was for what I'd done. She can't hear me now... and I can't talk to her or find her. 1, 2, 3 you're it. You don't listen to me anymore. You're not my friend anymore. Let me show you some photos. She's faking the smile because she said a boy should have presented her with her certificate. This is when she won her reading competition. Look. In this one we were fighting because... she said she should be the one wearing the huipil, not me. This is my mom's favorite. She says she always liked having her photo taken, even when she was little. This was her favorite. She used to say this was the best pose of all her photos. And this was at a party to celebrate St. James the Apostle. She was happy because all the boys were hot for her. They all bring back good memories of her, don't they? Yes. Now that Daniela's gone, I wonder what her family will do with all her things. What's going to happen to her dresses? To all her clothes that still have her essence? What's going to happen to this place? The hairdresser's isn't the same... without the music blaring, without her laugh, her scathing humor. I've lost count of the times I stayed behind here talking to her. Talking about our dreams and our troubles. What do you keep these for? If you don't want them, give them to me... and I'll throw them away. Don't you have change? I have a 20. Give it to me. You can pay me the difference next time. Thanks! What's your name? Modesto. Nice to meet you, Modesto! She's Darina and I'm Mabel. Hi! Let's take it from the top! Five, six, seven and enter. One, two, three and four, five, six, seven and eight. One, two, three and four, five, six, seven and eight. One, two, three and four, What are you doing, Darina? You look like you're kicking. Give me sexy, girl. Stop! Stop! Stop. Baby, please. If you're going to lead the show, I want you looking at the audience and smiling. Always smiling. Not worried about what you're doing. Let's repeat it again, please. Five, six, seven and enter. And one, two, three and change, five, six, seven and eight. One, two, three and change, five, six, seven and turn. Go keep an eye on the table at the back. She's barely the legal age. No, it's the lights. How long has she been working here? Almost... two years. What's her name? Her artistic name or how she likes to be introduced is Miss Bonbon. But I think her real name is... Leonor Martinez. I knew Daniela, but I can't say we were friends. When was the last time you saw Daniela? I don't remember. I think it was a week before she disappeared. I'm one of the first ones on and one of the first to leave, except on weekends. And Daniela used to get here early and leave late. Did she always leave on her own? I don't know. Like I said, my show is one of the first ones. I do my number and as soon as I'm done, I leave to go dance at another club. Do you know if she had a boyfriend? I wouldn't know. I never saw her with anyone who looked like he might be her man. She was easy, I know that much. What'll happen to these photos when I'm gone? No one's going to care about these memories. And the love that was here. No one's ever going to know what these photos once meant. Raquel, my godmother... Why didn't I say goodbye to her before I left? When she was probably the only one who would have understood and accepted me wanting to leave with Galdino. Is Veracruz nice? Yes, it's lovely, but I didn't stay there long. I went further north. That's where I live and work. Honey? And is the weather as insufferable in Veracruz as it is here? No, nana, there's no comparison. It's a lot hotter here. Are you still singing? No. After I broke up with Galdino... I didn't feel like going out or singing. Do you make a good living as a taxi driver? I get by. I don't have much choice. I wouldn't say I'm rich, but I make enough to do. It's like everything else around here. I like driving. It makes me feel good. And everyone who gets in my cab tells me their stories. Do you know anything about the muxe who was murdered? No. Just what everyone else knows, but I'm not familiar with the details. No. And the man who was arrested? All I know about him is that they call him "The Doll". His name is Rubén Jiménez, and he claims he's innocent, like everyone else on the inside, but who knows if he's telling the truth or not. Hey! Where do you think you're going? I'm here to see Mr. Rubén Jiménez. Visiting hours are 9:00 to 14:00 and 15:00 to 17:00, Monday through Sunday. - But... - And you have to show a valid ID. I can't let you in. Me and Daniela used to play like that. She used to run like a mad thing when she was little. I remember she had a pair of pink sneakers and she wouldn't go anywhere unless she had them on. When you're born this way... no one can change you. You sure work hard. It's not as if I have a choice. Do you always drive this slow? I don't like going fast... but that doesn't mean I take the slow lane in life, eh. That Lady Kansas used to date The Doll, the stripper. No one likes that bitch, myself included, but I have to admit... she pulls the crowds. There's no arguing with that. What is it you don't like about her? She's a... What is it you call those people who don't like our kind, - who hate us because... - Homophobes. That's the word. Can I help you? We're here to visit Mr. Rubén Jiménez. Unless you're family, only one visitor at a time. - A question. - What? A store nearby that sells cold beer. Alcoholic beverages aren't allowed in here, sir. It's not for the guy on the inside. It's for me. Oh. Go back two streets the way you came and take a right. There's a store there where you can buy beer. You go in. I'll wait here for you. Okay. Full name? Mabel Díaz López. Who are you here to see? Rubén Jiménez. Jiménez who? I don't know his other surname. Gender? Muxe. A wallet. A compact mirror. Open it, please. A lip gloss. Two lip glosses. Three in all. Canderel. Mints. A comb. Pick up your things, please. You can't take this in. Were you seeing Daniela? At first, like all men... I'd only date chicks, but it was different with Daniela, and admitting it doesn't make me any less of a man. On the contrary. Provided I played the champ. The champ? The one on top. The machete, if you will. So you remember Daniela? To be honest, I miss her. That's the first thing she said to me when we met. She said... You, Doll... I bet you'll miss me. And I'm not saying it because I get a kick out of it. We had a relationship. A good one. Me and Daniela took things to the next level. We even moved in together. What happened? Nothing. The usual. We broke up. She got involved with someone else after me. I don't know who. I'm a man. I wasn't going to grovel. It was big enough of me not to wish her any ill. - And you never tried to get back together? - No. You know when there's a third wheel in a relationship. It was over and as they say... There's no point flogging a dead horse. Do you know of a place called Cozumel? As far as I know... The motel. Except it used to be called "Delicias". Remember? Who's that? Daniela. Wow! She doesn't look like a muxe. Is she the one who died? Who's the other person who's cut out? That's what I'd like to know. So you came back because of what happened to your friend? Or were you already thinking of coming? No. Just because of her. So are you going to leave once you've solved it or will you stay? I don't know. Until I run out of money. - Can you take me to the Cozumel? - The motel? Is there somewhere else called that? Not that I know of. Will you take me? Sure. I want to know who brought Daniela to this motel. Whoever killed Daniela brought her here first. You think the answer's here? I do. Who gave you these photos? - I found them at Daniela's house. - Where exactly? In her bedroom. They might have been the last photos taken of her. Are they any use to you? They don't prove anything, but it's a start. So what more surprises do you have in that bag of yours? None. Are you busy? According to the medical examiner, Daniela was murdered one or two days before she was dumped. What does that mean? Whoever killed her didn't feel threatened by her presence. Anyone else would have killed her and gotten rid of the body, but he held her for 13 days. Daniela knew her killer, she let herself be tied up, she went to wherever she was killed of her own free will. I'm sure she knew her killer. You like him. What are you talking about? Come off it, you little slut! You know. You're all idiots. I don't fancy him. You always get the wrong end of the stick. You haven't stopped talking about him. You even have a glow about you. Just because I speak well of him it doesn't mean I fancy him. That's why I cut down on the booze. Every word you've said is nonsense. He's not bad looking. What's bad... What's disgusting is that you deny it. She's right! It's so annoying how she acts the innocent. But look at her. Those cheeks are a dead giveaway. They never lie. Just admit you like him. - You like him. You like him. You like him. - Shut up. I don't. It's your loss. What are you doing tomorrow? Nothing. I'll probably go to Darina's... and we'll think of something. But we were with them all day. What if you don't go? Tell her you want to rediscover Juchitán. Wouldn't you like to go somewhere with me? Where? I don't know, but the forecast says it's going to be sunny tomorrow, with a high probability of having a good time. - You'll pick me up? - Of course. I'm a gentleman. I'll see you out here tomorrow at 12. - Okay? - All right. - Thanks for the ride. - You're welcome. It's been a while since I came here. I bet. It's not Cancun, but it has its charm. Yes, it's nice. - Ready? - Mhmmm. Let's go. I don't get this modern music. There's not one you like? This one, but I'm not convinced. It all sounds... I prefer a good ballad, something more romantic, more, more... So you're a classic romantic. If you weren't a taxi driver, what would you have liked to have been? First of all, I'm not from here. I'm from Nayarit. I think because I grew up by the ocean, I'd have liked to go to Navy Academy. And then what? I came here with that idea in mind. I took the entrance exams and passed them and everything, but I failed the physical. They didn't want me because I have flat feet. They turned me away. I was the only one who jumped over 20 meters on the trampoline, but they still rejected me. Are you going to stay here? A few years. Then I'll decide what to do next. So how did you get started in the singing business? I learned to sing here. I had my show. I'd dance and sing, but I never stripped. Seriously. Then I went to a bigger bar in Veracruz. "The Clam". The owner was a politician, married, with kids. Then he was elected to congressman or senator. I'm not sure what they call it. When he left, "The Clam" closed and... I was out of a job. But you still sing? No, not much. I ended up with this guy... and I gave up the singing business, as you call it. Do you have a girlfriend...? Or a boyfriend or something? No. No. Well, sometimes, but not often. Only when I feel... the urge... or I'm feeling romantic or both. Look, let me show you my girl. Let's see. Ready? That's your girl? But look what she does. How do you do it? - Can I touch her? - Sure. But gently because otherwise she loses control. It feels good. I know. That pretty boy is my cousin Gerardo. He was my first love, although he never knew it. He got married and joined the army. And the one beside him is me, totally in love. My whole family's there. My granddad, Abdulio Díaz, along with my grandma, Roberta. There's my godparents, Raquel... and Odilio López. And here's Uncle Chucho, who was a good-for-nothing... that's his wife Pancha. My parents aren't in it because they died in a car crash. I was four. Look, here we all are having a few beers. Faraón and Darina, as fat as always. Daniela, Galdino and me. Here I am with Daniela. I remember we were going to sing together that day. It was the first time we'd ever done it. A few days before we bought those dresses in installments. We spent the whole day at her house... getting dressed... and doing our hair to get it to look like that. And here's Galdino. My ex. The bastard I ran away with and married. In the end, Galdino wasn't who I thought he was. How so? He changed. In time, he turned out to be possessive. And I mean fucking possessive. All because he didn't want me singing at "The Clam". If only Daniela knew... Galdino turned out not to be worth it in the end. Deep down, real deep down, Galdino was a jerk. To think I stopped singing for him. Too bad. Time to start over, right? Come here. It's my turn. Hey, would you sing for me? If you ask me nicely, yes. Sing to me. No, but first tell me, why would you sing for me? You know I fancy you. In love, it seems history repeats itself. The same codes, the same words, the same glances, but especially not being able to stop thinking about the other person and hoping he's thinking about you too at that precise moment. I'll have a dark beer, please. Thank you! Thank you all for being here. Like every other night, it's a pleasure for me to be able to host this show, which will begin in a few more minutes... here at your bar, the Kinj Kong. Tonight is a very special night... Because the Kinj Kong is celebrating its 18th anniversary. Might not sound like much, but it's been 18 long years. May I? Hi. Come on in. A big round of applause for the wonderful Miguelito. So this is where the transformation into beauty queens takes place? This is the place. Look at you. I can give you a once over if you want. You could use it. - No. - When I'm done here. No. Look. This is for you. "From Model. For Mabel." Model? My mom used to call me that when I was a kid. Like a term of endearment. She'd say... you're my model boy. Can I ask what it is? If I told you it wouldn't be a surprise. Wait and open it after the show. We'll open it together then. I'm going to get changed. To talk of an artistic career would be hard, especially in the case of a young lady who's been with us from the start. She left us... no, no, sorry... she went on tour, but she's back... to delight us with her moves and inimitable voice. Put your hands together for... elegance incarnate... Introducing... Mabel. Thank you! I'd like to dedicate this song to all the people who have always been there for me and who know me inside out. You too, Modesto, but I'd especially... like to dedicate this song... to my friend Daniela. ♪ A little more ♪ ♪ And maybe we'll come To understand each other ♪ ♪ A little more ♪ ♪ I smell a new sweetheart ♪ ♪ Let's get back on The path of love ♪ ♪ It doesn't matter What you have to forget ♪ ♪ If we're going to suffer Over a mistake ♪ ♪ It's better to beg ♪ ♪ A little more ♪ ♪ Will ease the blunders ♪ ♪ And if you go ♪ ♪ At the very least Take my tired arms with you ♪ ♪ After all, I've already given you ♪ ♪ My love, my faith, My entire life ♪ ♪ And if you don't take them With you, what do I care ♪ ♪ If they're left out In the cold ♪ ♪ Why are you leaving, My love? ♪ ♪ So hastily you can't enjoy My happiness ♪ ♪ If the night can wait The whole day ♪ ♪ You can wait too ♪ ♪ You can wait too ♪
