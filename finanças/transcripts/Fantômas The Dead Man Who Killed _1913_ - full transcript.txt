After the explosion at Lady Beltham's villa, Jérôme Fandor, gravely injured, is slowly recovering. THE FIGHT AGAINST THE BANDITS AFTERMATH OF THE TERRIBLE EXPLOSION IN NEUILLY The gardens surrounding Lady Beltham's villa on Richard-Wallace Blvd. in Neuilly were an apocalyptic sight. The wreckage teemed with police, rescue workers and ambulance crews pulling charred and dismembered bodies from the rubble. The nameless bodies attest to the violence of the explosion. INSPECTOR JUVE AMONG THE VICTIMS Reading these words, Fandor realises the gaping hole the loss of his friend is going to create in his life. Next to the courthouse, a second-hand shop run by Ma Toulouche, a well-known fence. She's recently hired a simpleton nicknamed Crânajour due to the fact that his cranium seems singularly empty. Toulouche's right-hand man, a prison guard named Nibet... The cellar under the shop connects to the sewers which empty into the Seine. Part One THE TRAGEDY IN RUE NORVINS Jacques Dollon, a young ceramist, works on rue Norvins in the heart of Montmartre. The next morning, the cleaning lady arrives. Terrified, she returns with the police. Baroness de Vibraye, dead. But how did she get here? Dear Madame, If you'd care to visit Montmartre one evening, I'd love to show you some ceramics I'm preparing for the salon. My sister Elisabeth should return soon. Humbly and respectfully yours, Jacques Dollon Unable to prove his innocence, the young artist is brought before the investigating judge. In the Anthropometry Department. Jacques Dollon, dazed, is then transferred to a courthouse holding cell. In his cell, Jacques Dollon falls prey to a vicious attack. Once again, it's Nibet at work. Mean while, in The Capital’s newsroom, Fandor, fully recovered, is finishing his article on the tragedy in rue Norvins. Hello, Fandor? Breaking news. Dollon was found strangled in his cell. This calls for an update. Breaking: News We've learned that Jacques Dollon, who was arrested for the murder of Baroness de Vibraye, has been found strangled in his cell. Our investigation is under way. Very quickly, Fandor arrives at the courthouse, which becomes his second home from that moment on. He's immediately admitted to the office of Judge Fuselier, who is in charge of the case. The journalist hands the judge his article entitled Scandal at the Courthouse. Elisabeth Dollon, having returned from a voyage, requests the judge's permission to see her brother, Jacques Dollon, who is being detained in a holding cell. Miss, you cannot see your brother... He is dead. Where is the body? Comforted by Jérôme Fandor, Elisabeth Dollon leaves the courthouse, that House of Tears. In The Capital's newsroom, Fandor writes a new article on the courthouse mystery. How can a corpse disappear from a cell without anyone noticing? This is the astounding question we may pose the authorities. JÉRÔME FANDOR, BE CAREFUL. THE MATTER YOU ARE INVESTIGATING IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE BUT MAY HAVE TERRIBLY DANGEROUS CONSEQUENCES... It takes more than that to scare the young journalist. Elisabeth Dollon arrives at rue Norvins to begin the painful inventory of her brother's studio. Baroness de Vibraye, April 3, Jacques Dollon Hold... Sonia Danidoff, April 19 Thomery, during May Nanteuil, end of May Meanwhile, in the sewers under the courthouse on Île de la Cité, the Man in Black prepares to perform a gruesome operation on the young ceramist's corpse. Part Two FANDOR'S INVESTIGATION Fandor has himself locked up in the courthouse in order to discover how a corpse could disappear from a holding cell there. Crânajour lodges in the garret over Toulouche's shop, and its skylight overlooks the courthouse roof. In an air duct, there are tracks... Midnight. In her shop, Ma Toulouche plays cards. Cargo arrives via the Seine at midnight. Be there to help me unload. The Sailor. To our health, Ernestine. Nibet is furious at Crânajour for his actions. But now Fandor knows how a body could have been removed from the holding cell without using the door... Part Three THE PRINCESS'S NECKLACE That evening, the cream of Paris society throngs the party hosted by Thomery, a prominent sugar manufacturer, in honour of his upcoming marriage to Princess Sonia Danidoff. Thomery shows the princess the boudoir provided for her private use. An incident. Pardon me. I must fix this tear. Once again, it's Nibet. He catches the necklace and calmly walks off. A senior police official is among the guests. He immediately begins searching for clues. Did you notice that fingerprint? We've got him. The next day, in the Anthropometry Department, the senior official compares his photograph with the police files. The fingerprint is a perfect match to one recently filed... FIRST AND LAST NAME: JACQUES DOLLON BORN FEBRUARY 20, 1888 IN PARIS PROFESSION: CERAMIST/PAINTER RIGHT HAND FINGERPRINTS I'd like to believe you, but that's absurd. Dollon died a week ago, and the necklace was stolen last night. Perhaps so, but Dr. Bertillon's system is infallible. The print is definitely Jacques Dollon's. Part Four NANTEUIL, THE BANKER A few weeks later, in the banker's office. To Nanteuil, from Detouche. Market order to buy 500 shares of Thomery stock, deliverable in five days. Sir, a lady asks to see you. She wouldn't give her name. Lady Beltham, Fantômas's mistress, accomplice and victim. Unable to resist her tyrant, the poor woman obeys. We have reason to believe that Princess Sonia Danidoff would be interested in these pearls, which are just as fine as those stolen from her. We could obtain a similar necklace for her at an excellent price. 3 o'clock, Weber Restaurant, Buttes-Chaumont Park. Thomery goes to the princess to tell her of the dastardly extortion. The meeting at Weber Restaurant. The emissary of the thief is waiting. Part Five ELISABETH DOLLON The young lady has taken lodgings at Bourrat's boardinghouse in Auteuil. Baroness de Vibraye, April 3, Jacques Dollon Hold... Sonia Danidoff, April 19 Thomery, during May Nanteuil, end of May Bourrat's boardinghouse is quite reputable, but, due to a premonition, Elisabeth seeks a hiding place for the strange list. She resolves to accept the aid Jérôme Fandor offered her. Dear Mr. Fandor, In my brother's studio, I found a strange list of names and dates, which recent crimes have given a sinister meaning. I don't dare risk mailing it. Would you come get it tomorrow at Bourrat's boardinghouse? At midnight. Fantômas himself comes to search for the list he lost at Jacques Dollon's. Elisabeth is deeply asleep, doubtlessly due to the herbal tea she drank before bed... After a fruitless search, Fantômas decides the young woman will take his secret to the grave. The next morning, Fandor arrives at The Capital. In my brother's studio, I found a strange list of names and dates, which recent crimes have given a sinister meaning. I don't dare risk mailing it.

And Fandor goes to recover the mysterious document.

A police captain with a striking resemblance to Nanteuil, the banker, accompanied by an aide oddly similar to Nibet, the guard... DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SEARCH WARRANT By order of Judge Fuselier, Captain Dulac is authorised to immediately search the lodgings of Elisabeth Dollon at Bourrat's boarding house in Auteuil. By taking everything, Fantômas is sure to finally recover the incriminating list. But... it's Thomery. Shaken, Fandor returns to The Capital's newsroom. The editor requests Fandor to write an article as soon as possible on Thomery's mysterious disappearance, which has been causing his company's stocks to crash over the past 24 hours. Thomery, during May Nanteuil, end of May Jérôme listen to this. Havas News Agency We have learned that Mr. Thomery's body has just been found in an empty apartment on rue Lecourbe. The deceased had been strangled with a police chief's scarf on which were found, once again, the fingerprints of Jacques Dollon, who committed suicide in his holding cell. The fake police chief at Bourrat's boardinghouse. His scarf around Thomery's corpse's neck. Once again, Jacques Dollon's fingerprints... Nothing but bizarre clues. Part Six THE GLOVES OF HUMAN SKIN That morning, near police headquarters at quai des Orfèvres, Fandor again studies the mysterious list sorely missing his friend Juve's intuition. Juve's office. It's you, Juve... It's really you. I needed to hide. Thanks to Crânajour, I was able to get close to Fantômas's gang and save your life in the sewers. Baroness de Vibraye, April 3, Jacques Dollon Hold... ditto Sonia Danidoff, April 19 Thomery, during May Nanteuil, end of May You and I are going to pay this Nanteuil a visit. JÉRÔME FANDOR JOURNALIST, THE CAPITAL INSPECTOR JUVE NATIONAL POLICE The secret of the dead man's prints. The skin of Jacques Dollon's hands. You're finished, Fantômas.
