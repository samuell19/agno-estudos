My god! My god! No! Shit. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Come on. Shit. Shit. Come on. OK. What the? Come on. Thank god. OK. Chuck. Chuck. Shit. Rings of Saturn. Chuck! Sam? What the hell? The phone has been ringing for like two hours. And I'm working. Yeah, answering the phone is working. Chill out, Mr. I'm Going Off the Grid for a While. What, you lasted like two days? Yeah, well, things haven't worked out quite as I planned. Being responsible for an entire summer camp, what could possibly go wrong? You have no idea. No, actually, you might have the exact idea, which is why I'm calling you, 'cause everything started out so great, and now there's this crazed killer roaming the campground. Wait, really? Yes, Chuck, really. Everyone is dead, or almost everyone. Whoa. Damn. I mean, that sometimes happens, especially the camp counselors. But I just never thought-- I know, I know. It's terrible. It really is terrible, and I'm really scared. So I thought maybe you can help me out, give me some king of advice so I'm not, you know, dying. OK. Yeah, well, first of all, your phone seems to be working fine. Wouldn't you rather call the cops? I did. I called the sheriff. I left a voicemail. Wait, a voicemail? Yeah, a voicemail. I mean, he's 76. He doesn't really work nights anymore, and-- and given that and the town being 25 miles away, I mean, I don't think anyone's getting here before I'm dead. How far off the grid did you go? Far. 25 miles. Gotcha. All right, well-- well, first, I got to ask how many so far. What-- what do you mean? Like, body count. How many dead? I don't know. I don't know, you know. I'm a little flustered. Counting's not, like, my thing right now. How did this even start? I'm not sure. All I remember is that everything started out so great when we first got here. No phones, no shirt. Step right up. And I designed the logo myself this year. I think they're pretty cool. What do you think, Carol? Yeah? OK. Yeah? It's all right. Hey, Ted. Hey, thank you for choosing Clear Vista this year. I know you had a lot of offers. Steve! The Kayak King. How you doing, man? So glad to have you back. My pleasure, my pleasure. Good to be back. Here you go. One thing, and it's not a big deal. It's not a big deal, but, um, they're canoes, so-- don't even worry about it. It's fine. Yeah, not a big deal. What's up, Sam? Hey. Drew, right? Yeah. Find you one. There you are. I'm totally ready to just unplug from the world and catch a vibe with this place. Beer? It's really peaceful here. Super peaceful. That's the spirit. You guys hear that? Wait, wait, wait. Imani's there? Well, I mean, I couldn't not hire her because she dumped me. That's discrimination. God. Hi, Imani. I don't wanna be a whiny bitch, but-- Might wanna just leave it there then. - Thank you, Freddie. - Here you go. Thanks. Is this unplugging necessary? Nature is our nature. Come on. It's going to be a fun awesome-- - OK, whatever. --relaxing weekend. Here you go. If you're look for other ways to stimulate yourself, just you let me know. OK. Here you are. - Yeah. - Thanks, Brad. Guess I'll have to give that harassment speech after all. Look, guys, when the kids get here, it's really hard work. So you're going to want to appreciate every moment. Yeah. Being in nature? That's what you are saying. You know? Right. - Commune with nature. - Right. Thank you. That's what-- exactly. Jamie, right? You gotta give these kids the best summer they've ever had. Wait, hold on a second. OK. So of the group, who's dead so far? OK, I wanna say all of them, but definitely most of them. And-- and when we say dead, you mean killed. Yeah. Stabbed, mutilated, ripped apart. And now he's hunting me. And you've seen him? Yeah, freaky looking dude, really scary. Ugly, ugly. I mean, hideously ugly dude. Like Freddy ugly or Matt Cordell ugly? Maniac Cop. I'm just gonna say ugly. And you're sure it's a dude? Well, isn't it always a dude? Aw, just ask Jason's mother. Excuse me. $26.66. My god. I think he's found me. My god. Chuck. Got your Serial Slasher card? God. Kill. Kill, kill. Because that's like the classic bag that you-- Chuck, do you hear that? Hear what? Voices, voices. The store is full of customers. I hear tons of voices. No, no, no, not them. Gas. I smell gasoline. Gas? Sam, what is going on there? My god. Shit. Shit. - Sam? My-- Hello? Sam? My god. Shit. OK. What? Sam. You almost gave me a heart attack hanging up on me like that. You gave me a heart attack blowing up my phone for everyone in this camp to hear. Well, OK-- well, in the spirit of offering you advice, I'd suggest maybe silencing your phone. You don't think I already thought to silence my-- OK, look. I had a thought. OK, you said this crazed killer is a guy, right? OK, so maybe we should talk about the guys out there, you know? See if we can figure out who this asshole is. How does knowing who it is help me not die? Well, I think figuring out what they want could help you not die. Smart. Like, is it an old camper who got teased as a kid and is back for blood? No. Or is it a parent who's looking for revenge after a counselor let their kid drown? Jesus, I hope not, no. Or does one of the counselors have a formerly conjoined twin? What movie is that from? That could be a huge problem. No, it's nothing like that, Chuck, OK? It's-- it's nothing like that, I promise. OK? OK. OK, let me think. Um. You mentioned some guy named Steve. Yeah. Steve, the Kayak King. But it's not him. My god. Steve, the Kayak King. He's up shit's creek now, and I'd say without a paddle, but-- Who does this? What kind of psycho? Holy shit. Is that Ted? It's Steve. The Kayak King. Guys, he isn't the only one. We found Bob and Carol's bodies in the kitchen. Ted and Alice are missing. So is Drew. Who's Drew? from the city. Missing. Not necessarily dead. So you're an optimist. Wait. What if one of them did this? This is insane. We have to do something. Sam, what do we do? What? Well, we all gotta-- OK, we all need to-- We all just need to-- we really gotta-- Put an end to this bullshit, get our cell phones and call the police. What the hell? No. No, no, no, no. Somebody better explain quick. Sam, where are the phones? It's impossible. I put them all in here. I locked it. No one knows the combo but me. You mean your birthday? Hey. Come on! What the hell's going on? That's bad. Right? What now, Sam? Are there any other vehicles on the property? No, no, this was it. Great. Looks like we're walking. No, no, no, I-- I don't think that's a good idea. I mean, guys, look around. There's swamp and marshland in every direction. A town's not for 25 miles. OK, so we hump it. We can take that. Maybe when the sun comes up, but not now. There's snakes and gators out there-- poisonous snakes, giant gators. Great. So we get sliced up by a madman or eaten by reptiles. Did you see Steve? I vote reptiles. There's gotta be a third choice. What if we hole up in the cabins until morning? Yeah, 'cause those old ass cabins are super secure. No, no, no. Jamie, that's a good idea, all right? We can find an area, and we can make it as safe and secure as possible. No, Sam, no. Look, that's not enough. I wanna take the fight to this guy. Fair enough, OK? We'll-- we'll divided into teams, OK? Half of us on defense to make a safe place, the other half of us on offense. We'll set up traps. We'll take it to this guy. Wait, wait wait. You went patrolling by yourself? Well, it's pretty logical in the heat of the moment. Yeah. OK, that's fair and all, but it also means you get killed quicker. Can we just move on, please? Come on. I don't think this is a good idea. Why, 'cause Sam didn't say so? Yeah, kinda. Look. They're trying to fight a maniac with toothpicks and pots and pans. All right, if I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die trying. Yeah, die running. Come on, man, that's what you're saying. Good people don't run away from a fight. And guess what, Nancy? You're not not gonna be good for anything if you're dead. Hey, what's going on, guys? Sam already said it's too dark out there for us to go out. Sam. Right, yeah, Sam. Plus, I don't wanna just desert everyone. Deserting? Whoa, you guys, I told you-- We're not deserting anyone. All right, you're saving yourself. --there's swap and marshland in every direction, poisonous-- You know what? I don't have time for this. I'm getting out of here. Holy shit! Nancy, run! Jesus! It was beyond traumatic. And that's it? Yeah, yeah. Horrifying. But why didn't he kill you? I don't know. You know, I-- I don't-- I just don't know. Well, think about it. Why? Why-- why did he kill Freddie or Nancy or Steve or any of the others? Why-- why does it even matter? OK, here's a different question for you. Are you covered in blood? Chuck, are you even listening to me? Just answer the question, Sam. No. Um, a little. Why? So if you were just a witness to these murders, then how come you're covered in blood? You know, I don't-- I just don't know. I'm, helping my niece with her creative writing assignment. Man, the crap education kids get this days. Whose blood is it? What do you mean? Well, is it your blood? How-- how-- how would I be able to tell? Well, are you bleeding? No, I don't-- I don't-- I don't think so. No. If you were just a witness to these murders, why are you covered in blood? Because I was a close witness. I mean, I was-- I was, like, a very hands-on witness. I was really, like, right there. OK, what else? Are you holding a weapon of any kind? Probably a sharp one? No, no. I mean, just this baseball bat. Wait. I mean, a knife. Sort of. Sort of knife? Well, I don't know. Would you consider this a weapon? In this context, yes. But you could have had it because you were protecting yourself. Where did you get it? I don't know. You really don't know? No, I don't know. I mean, I thought I was holding a baseball bat, but now I have a really weird knife. Weird how? I don't know. I mean, it's like made of like jawbone, like the serrations are teeth. It's got like a real sacrificial vibe. And I don't know, it's hard to place the era. Like the knife that you described the killer carrying? Yes. Sam. OK. Look. I hate to ask you this, but are you sure you're not the killer? I can't be 100% sure. Maybe this is like a Jacob's Ladder kind of thing, and I'm already dead, and none of this is real. Well, that's not possible because I'm here and I'm very much alive. Damn it. Not that, you know, you're alive. But, you know what I mean. OK, look. I mean, you're-- you're definitely not the killer type. You know, this is just not you. Maybe you're like out of your mind or something. Did somebody drug you? No, I don't think so. Well, and you keep saying that the killer's like hideously ugly, and you are definitely not that. - Aw. - Wait. Are you wearing a mask? No. Are you sure? Um. I'm pretty sure. Damn. That would've explained everything. 'Cause, like, if you're physically killing somebody but that's not really you, then this could've been the case where the consciousness of the killer was like possessed by an object, like an evil mask. My god. Kill. Kill him. Kill. Um, Chuck? Kill. Kill him. Kill, kill, kill. Kill. Kill. My god! My god. - What? I'm the killer. My god. What am I gonna do? You didn't realize you were murdering him? Stabbing, tying him up? No. I just remember standing in front of him already dead. Well, what did you think you were doing? I don't know. Talking to you now, it's coming more into focus. Honestly, I don't think I was thinking anything until the mask came off. You really didn't know that you were murdering Steve? No, no. I was staring at him like you'd stare at anyone you found diced up and dead hanging from a tree. It was just horrible. But you know now that it was you doing it. I saw what the mask saw. You forcing me to remember everything is bringing up stuff that I didn't even know was there. It's kinda freaking me out. So, yeah. I'm pretty sure it was me. I'm sorry I dragged you into this, Chuck. No. Don't apologize. You know I live for this kind of thing. Look. I found some reference books, some really old stuff that-- that we had in the storage room in storage, stuff that never sold. You mean stuff you stashed away so you could keep it. Maybe. Um, anyway, I know that we're going to get to the bottom of this. So what should I do now? Lock myself away? I mean, I don't want to kill any more people. Is there anyone left to kill? Yeah. Yeah, I mean, there's tons. I mean, you know, I think-- yes, I think so. There are people alive technically, which is good, and we wanna-- we wanna keep them that way. This conversation's harder knowing that I'm the killer. What about Imani? Still can't believe you invited her back. How's that going? You guys cool? Can't we just keep talking about me killing people? Well, yeah. Yeah, I mean-- well, that-- that's where I was going. I-- I was gonna say like, if-- if she still cares about you, you could confide in her, and then maybe she can help you. Yeah. Yeah. Um. OK. I just-- I'm-- I'm really not really sure where she is right now. OK, I think Imani's dead. Wait, what? Why didn't you tell me that? I don't know. I just-- You just remembered. Yes. Damn it! God, she was-- she was really something. OK, guys, well-- hold on. OK, guys. OK, I don't think-- here, can you hold that for me real quick? It's not working. Maybe try to get it to work if you can. All right, guys, well, welcome to Camp Clear Vista. My name is Steve. Some of you know that already 'cause you're in the best cabin ever. My cabin, right? This is perfect. The camp, the kids, the counselors. Yeah, Steve's really good with kids. And those kayaks. But these are in fact what? Canoes. Great, that's right. I'm glad you guys knew that. So camp ends on Friday. What are we going to do then? - I don't know. You know this is just a summer fling for me. It's more than that. What? Come on. Are you worried about the kids seeing us? No. Have to learn sometime. Then what? I don't know. Why can't you just relax? You know? Have a good time. And when it's all done, you'll have a good memory. Just enjoy it. Now these are only to be used to the water, OK? It's not for hitting people, OK? It can also be used for air guitar or as a golf-- you know, like a, um, club there, OK, guys? But not for hitting, definitely, OK? And don't worry if you end up in the water 'cause we send a scuba diver out there about a week ago to check for alligators, and, he hasn't come back yet, so I think he's doing a very thorough job. If you see him, you know, let us know. You know, people were worried. So all right. Don't look like a sad puppy. Why do people think I look like a puppy dog? 'Cause you do. Come here. Come here. Whoa, hey! No. How could you? Everybody, we're gonna play and laugh at Sam, OK? He just fell in the water there. Steve, save me! That's why you wear the life preservers. That's why you wear the life preservers. You fell for it. I'm gonna destroy this thing. Be very careful how you do that. Sam. Sam, what's going on? I tried to burn the mask. Your face is burning, isn't it? Yeah. I was worried about that. I'm afraid the thing probably imprinted on you. There's plenty of instances of that happening in here. How do you know that? Sam, please, you called me for a reason. Wait. Shh, shh, shh. Hey. I think I saw that son of a bitch heading this way. Do we really wanna find him? When I catch this guy, I'm gonna beat him till he's dead. Then revive him so I can chop him up into little bitty pieces. They're on to me. They're coming after me. Who? Whoever's still alive. How do they know you're the killer? They tried to burn the cabin down with me in it. That's a pretty goddamn good clue. This doesn't make any sense. Why would Sam do this? I don't care. I just want him dead. What about giving yourself up? Like, explain the situation. Maybe they can restrain you so you don't kill anybody else. Brad would kill me. He'd ripped my head off, Chuck. I'm trying to stay alive. OK, where are you now? Still hiding. Hold on. Yeah, OK, I think I'm-- I think I'm good for now. OK. OK, good. All right. So just-- just stay where you are and-- and hunker down. OK. Um. OK, I'm hunkered. OK, good. I think we just need to regroup and focus. Yeah. Right. OK. And-- and maybe we can come up with like a timeline of exactly what you did with the mask on. OK. OK. Yeah. OK, what is your first memory of things going wrong or going weird? OK, I remember being confused as to why I was running. Running. Running where? Away from a dead tree. Yeah. I-- I remember something bad happened near a dead tree, and-- What? Shit. İt's right there, and I just-- I can't remember. Shit. OK, what do you remember? I remember a pool. Hey, pal. Kill. Having a little palm party there perving on us? You chopped his head in half? Yeah. What did you do to her? I liked it better when I didn't remember. Whoa, hey. Kill those lights. What is the matter with you? You wanna flag everybody around here, get them to all come in here and get to the good stuff before us? Come on, they're all out looking for that grave thing anyway. Yeah, which gives us a chance to party. So help me out? Yes. Jackpot. Now all we need is-- --chocolate. Kill. Kill Carol. Damn, Sam. I know. I hate myself. Well, is it too obvious to ask why didn't you just take the mask off? When it's on, I don't want to. Yeah. Shoulda figured. But this kill was different. I think it pushed me a little too far. I-- I-- I became aware of myself for just a split second. No. No. Please. Please don't make me. Kill. Kill, kill, kill. Kill Steve, the Kayak King. Kill the Kayak King, Steve. Steve. Hey. Just getting 'em ready for their maiden voyage. Kill Steve. Who-- who is that? What are you doing here? What are you wearing? Wow. This is so bad. So how many do you think you've killed? You know what I think? This asshole should kill himself. How long have you been listening? Long enough. You should choose your friends more wisely. Have fun being an accomplice to murder, sweetie. I'll have you know it's a killer mask doing it, not my friend. Don't act like that sounds so weird. They're right, you know. I should just kill myself. You found an evil mask, and you put it on. What in God's name did you think would happen? I don't need your judgment right now, Chuck. Can you at least remember where you found this thing? We were scared shitless. And we'd been looking everywhere. We even called the police. When we finally found him, his body-- or what was left of him-- his body was just lying there limp and lifeless, his eyes glazed over. We realized that Brad had gotten so drunk that he locked himself in his car and fell asleep. Thank you. Thanks, Freddie. Thank you, Brad. All right, I'm gonna-- I'm gonna tell a different kind of story. OK? It's sort of, um-- sort of like a history lesson. It's about this camp, and it's all true, and it happened right here on this very land. So long before the French Cajuns arrived here, the natives lived in harmony with the land. It was peaceful back then. But when the Cajun settlers came with their gris-gris and their potions and black magic, they awoke something, something dark, sinister. And it struck with a vengeance. Suddenly, these Cajun settlers started dying in the most horrific ways, right? Killing each other. Killing themselves. It went on this way for many months till finally a, , a medicine man, was able to trap the dark spirit in an old red oak tree somewhere in these woods. And there it stayed locked up for 100 years, and people were safe. Until one winter day when a woodcarver came upon the tree right here in these woods and he chopped the tree down to get his wood. But something happened 'cause this woodcarver, his trade was furniture, children's toys. But that day, something compelled him to carve a mask. And this mask was unlike-- unlike any other. It had dark empty eyes that drank in the light, sucking the goodness out of the world. Do we have to listen to this? Aw, somebody's spooked. Guys, guys, listen. I'd-- I'd stop, but this isn't just some story. This is the real history of this place. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. So you're saying you knew all along that your family's campground had this creepy history with the evil mask? Not to sound like a broken record, but why the hell did you put that mask on? Would you just listen to me please? So finally one night when the woodcarver couldn't sleep, every night he'd have nightmares. Said to his wife he was hearing voices. Ever since he carved this mask, he'd been restless. So he took it out into the woods, and he goes to destroy the mask. And as he raises his ax, again something compels him instead to put the mask on. And although this man was known as the kindest person in his town, that night he killed everybody in the village, including his own family. There was one survivor. It was a young woman who happened to be out butchering chickens, and when she came back, she used the butcher's ax to kill the woodcarver. Wow. Goosebumps. OK. But I'm telling you, ever since this land has been plagued with all kinds of weird accidents, unexplained deaths, murders. I'm sure you guys have heard stories. But to this day, the evil mask has never been found. Steve! Come on, Steve. You know we don't play those crazy games. Crazy white boy Steve. Come on now. Yeah, so, guys, in-- in all seriousness, the murders were horrendous. So, you know, be careful out there. And it's also true that the mask was never found, and the legend has it that it's buried at the woodcarver's grave, which is somewhere on this property. OK. Let me get this right. We have a creepy mask and a cursed grave. Two words, guys. Treasure hunt. Right? Come on. No, no, no, guys. Come on. We're gonna make this fun, Sam. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Stop being little boys, seriously. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait wait, wait. You guys, that's not the point of the story. Sam, I don't think your story had a point anyway. It's a cool legend. Guys. Yeah. He was just trying to scare us with that story. Come on, baby. Hi. Hi. Shall we go? What are you talking about? Your parents have owned this land for how many years now? Like you don't know where the grave is. I-- I mean, maybe. I guess I'll meet you there. No, um-- I mean, I'm sorry. You know, I'm responsible for these wackos, so. I understand. Look, I got the fire. I'm cozy. I'll just stay here. You go on. Hey, guys? Drew. Hey, Drew. Come on. This is not funny, guys. Drew? Drew? Guess who? God! Drew. Gotcha. Not funny. Come on. This place is like creepy cool. So you didn't actually have any idea what this was, did you? I didn't need to, did I? OK, you got me. Can we go now? Drew, come on. Let's go back to the others, all right? Do you know if this says anything? Yeah, it says, "Congratulations, you found me. Now get the hell out of here." You can go brag to everyone else. Come on, Drew. Seriously, I've been here a bunch. It's not a big deal. There's a tree. There's a saddle, the headstone. What is this? That's the ground. Good one. What a surprise. So scared. My god. Hey, hey, don't touch that. Drew. Dude, I know the whole first night initiation thing. I've been going to camps since I was eight. No, this is not that, OK? Trust me, please. Can we just get out of here? Please, just put that down, and let's go, OK? Drew, come on. Hey, don't put that on. OK. God. You put it on. Die. Kill, kill, kill. Kill. Sam. Sam. Sam. Sam. It's yours. Sam. The knife is yours. Take it. I thank you. Sam, this isn't funny anymore. Kill. Kill, kill. Sam. Sam. OK, look, with all this craziness, it just goes to show you that history loves repeating itself. You know, Sleepaway Camp and killer masks. It's like fries and gravy, peanut butter and bananas, Mets fans and perpetual suffering. Things that go together even though they shouldn't. Right. All right. Let me see if I got this straight. Drew was your first kill, and then the skinny dipper. Then what? - And then-- Steve, the Kayak King. Did I forget anyone? Right. So without knowing about the others, you've killed eight so far. Nine. Imani. OK, so nine. This is so bad. None of them deserve this. Well, I think it's only gonna get worse. I think you're probably gonna die. Wow. Sorry, Sam. It's just that's how these things seem to go. On the bright side, though, in a lot of these cases, the killer comes back in a couple of years. You know, lightning strikes their grave, and then they're back from the dead. That's not funny. You know it could happen. There's got to be something that we're missing. There's just got to be. How did Imani die? OK, after we found Steve hanging from that tree, that's when we all started making traps. We figured we had to catch the killer. Catch me. Holy shit, Jamie. Did you just do that? Good job. You guys dig a lot of holes? It's not quite the arts and crafts project I was hoping for, but we're getting through this. You know, to be honest, I liked last summer way better. Yeah, me too. My girlfriend and I are going to culinary school together. That's the plan anyway if, I get in. What are you gonna do? Marry a rich guy. Smart. Well, that works. OK. So we checked the perimeter. Everything's clear. Yeah, there's no one in that patch, so we should be safe for now, guys. Guys, what was all that noise? We were just testing the alert system. OK, good. Sam, what do we do now? Well, we've got a secure perimeter. OK, that doesn't answer our question. What do we do now? Well, I think now we-- you know, we just circle the wagons. You know, circle the wagons. Stay inside the safe zone. There's a killer out there. We circle the wagons, we'll be sitting ducks. We need to go after this guy. OK. Yeah. Yeah, let's-- let's kick it up a notch, man. Hey, why don't we combine offense and defense? Yeah. Um, I'll-- I'll run outside the perimeter, right? I'll run around. I'll be like bait. OK, and then the killer sees me. I'll run back, trip the alarm. He'll come in. You guys converge on him, force him into the pit. - What? - Y'all seen Jamie's pit? What if you end up coming from the other direction? There's no alarm there. How many pots and pans? I can go 100 feet that way and be a lookout. By yourself? Jamie. I'll go with her. Yeah, that makes more sense. - Yes. - Let's just do this. Jamie, I got you. Kill, kill, kill, kill. Sam. Sam. Wear it. Wear it. Do it, do it, do it. Kill. Kill, kill, kill. Sam. Kill. No. Sam. Now. Kill, kill. Kill. I don't think this is a good idea. Why, 'cause Sam didn't said so? Yeah, kinda. Well, guess what, Nancy? You're not gonna be good for anything if you're dead. Sam already said it's too dangerous out there to go out in the dark. Plus, I don't wanna just desert everybody. You're not deserting anyone. Right, you're saving yourself. I don't have time for this. I'm getting out of here. Hey, asshole. Come over here. Come on. Come on, let's play a game. Little bit closer. Come on. There you go. Kill, kill. Hey, assface! This way, baby, come on! Die. Die. Kill her now. Kill Imani now, now, now, now, now. Kill her. Imani! Go, go, go, go, go! My god. My god! My god! My god! My god! My god! Rings of Saturn. Chuck! This is a really bad development, Sam. You know, I really thought I had a chance of getting back together with Imani. What? Yeah, it's bad that Imani is dead, but, no, I'm talking about the other girl, Jamie. Jamie? Hold on, hold on. What's bad about Jamie? Well, the fact that she's still alive. I mean, it's good for her, but it's bad for you. In what sense is that bad for me? In the sense that she's gonna kill you. Jamie? What, are you crazy? Your friend's got serious relationship problems. Hey, it's after midnight. How come you haven't turned into a pumpkin? Come on. I have to lock up. OK, what time do you open? Yeah, yeah, goodbye. Jamie's the last person I have to worry about. Precisely. No, no, no, no, Chuck, you don't understand. You know, Jamie-- Jamie's like the sweetest girl on the planet. I-- I mean, you should see her dig, but she's really, really gentle. She loves to paint. I mean, she wanted to run arts and crafts. Haven't you learn anything from the thousands of hours we've spent watching horror movies? If you're the killer, Jaime's your final girl. Final-- Laurie in Halloween, Nancy from Nightmare, Sally from Chainsaw. It happens all the time. It's-- it's always the purest soul. It's always the last girl to survive. Listen, Chuck, I take back whatever I said about you over explaining stuff. Well, exposition is my middle name. So let's say I kill Jaime. My god. I-- I can't kill Jaime. What am I talking about? This is crazy. Well, Is there anyone left that could kill you, anyone at all? Whoever lit that cabin on fire. That-- that could be Brad. You know, it probably was Brad, and I don't remember killing him either. Well, as soon as you put that mask on, he's toast. Bloody toast. That's insane. You're-- you're saying if I put on this mask, I can kill some muscle bound meat head like Brad, but a-- a sweet girl like Jaime's gonna kill me? Yep. Wow. There he is. All right. So let me get this straight. Only one person walks out of here alive, and that's the most pure person. Always. And that's never the killer? No. And not just in the movies. Do you remember Boondock Butcher? No, Chuck, I don't remember the Boondock Butcher. A kindergarten teacher put a stop to his killing spree, and she must've weighed like 98 pounds soaking wet. Captain Howdy, 'member? Yeah, a nun crushed him with the steeple bells. Meaty Face-- guess who stopped him. A paraplegic. Rolled over him again and again with spiked wheelchair tires. Must've taken like two hours. All right, all right, enough. Thank you. I get it. I get it. OK, Jamie's gonna kill me. That's great. That's awesome. Sorry, Sam. Of all the possible parallel universes, you've got to live and die in this one. What are you gonna do? Kill the bastard. No, I don't wanna kill Brad. I wish this goddamn mask would kill me. Wait a minute. I have an idea, Chuck. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I have a pretty good idea. Sam, what's going on? It was a bad idea, Chuck. It didn't work. It didn't work. Die you bastard! What the hell? Sam. Kill. Goddamn. Damn you. Sam. My god. Damn you. Damn you. Fight it, Sam. Fight it. Kill. Kill. Kill. Sam, come closer. You can do it. Closer. No. No, goddamn you. I won't put you on. God, no, no. No. No, no. You bastard. Sam. Die, asshole. No. No. No! Sam. Sam? Kill, kill, kill. Sam. Sam. Sam. It's OK. It's just me. It's just me. I thought you were dead. Yeah, I know. But, hey, I figured if he thought I was dead, I'd be off his list, right? Give me an advantage. You-- you think he murdered all of us here intentionally? Well, I don't know, and I don't care. Well, how do we get out of here? There's only one way. Over Sam's dead body. Come on. Hey. There's stuff in here we can use. Look. You can do some damage with these. You'll be dead before you get close enough. If I got a good swing with this-- You'll be dead if you miss. This is way too heavy. Close the door. Samuel Justin Wescott, don't you even think about it! Stop it, man! Come on! OK. OK. No. OK. My god. My god. My god. My god. No, no, no, no. God, what do we do? My god. My god. Hold on, look around. Look around. Find something. Think quick. Imani. Hold on. What's this? Wait. Shovel. Shovel. OK. Go, go. Come on. Let's go. There you are, Sam. Caged, no other way out. I thought you were dead. And I thought you were a nice guy, but now I want you to rot in hell. Let's go. No. No, no, no, no, no, it wasn't me. It was the mask. The mask made me do it. The mask? Yes, yes, Jaime. Jaime, I swear, I swear I have fought with every fiber of my being against it. You're such a liar. No, I-- I promise. I've struggled! You kept your phone. What? We had to lock our phones up. You kept yours. It's my camp. I'm responsible for everyone. I have to have my phone in case of an emergency. It's selfish and two-faced. Letting people think you're dead is pretty damn selfish. Really? Is that right? Yeah, yeah. I was heartbroken enough when you dumped me. OK? It wasn't just a summer fling. You-- you don't think I wouldn't care if you were dead? You tried to kill me! I was not trying to kill anyone! Yes, you were! My god. Look, look, look. You know me better than anyone, except maybe my friend Chuck. You know I'm telling the truth. I could never do these things that I've been doing. This-- this thing makes me do them. It-- it's the story that I told you. It has some awful power when you put it on. Its evil takes hold of you. The legend is true. If you knew the legend was true, why'd you put it on? That's the thing! I didn't put it on. Drew did. Yeah. Drew put it on me. Drew. Yes. Yes. We found it at the woodcarver's grave. What were you doing with Drew alone in a forest? Jesus. It would've been nothing if you didn't have your dumb let's go on a treasure hunt idea. You know, Jamie, one could make the argument that this whole mess is Imani's fault. My fault? Yes. I'm not the one with the crazy knife, and I'm not the one who mistakes a summer fling with something-- It was more than a summer fling! You guys! This is not the time. Sam, you need to promise no more killing. No more killing. I swear. Look, I need you guys to stay alive so I can stay alive. I'm not following your logic, Sam. Look, I've been talking to my friend Chuck, and she says the way these things always go is that it's the final girl who kills the killer. So as long as you two are alive, you know? No final girl. We-- we all stay safe. Your friend must be as crazy as you are. Hold on. OK. Here we go. Sometimes she doesn't pick up right away. Sam? Chuck! Hey. God. Are you OK? Yes. Well, no, I'm-- I'm locked up, but that's-- I'm still kicking. I panicked. I-- I-- I called the sheriff by the camp. Yeah? Left a voicemail. God, he should just retire. Um, hey, Chuck. This is, Imani, Sam's friend. Hi. So, Chuck, I-- I need you to back me up here and tell these ladies about this whole final girl thing because I'm-- I'm looking pretty crazy right now. Ladies? Jamie, she's there too? Yeah, yeah, Jamie. Jamie. Chuck, Jamie, Jamie, Chuck. Yeah, yeah, Jamie's here. Um, Jamie hit me with a shovel. OK. OK, um, well, yeah. First of all, ladies, I know this is all insane. Just bear with me for a minute. But, OK, whatever you do, do not let Sam put the mask on his face again, OK? The mask is responsible for all this, not Sam. And, second, in situations like this, in the paranormal or when there's a lunatic on the loose or whatever, there's usually a pure and innocent girl, you know, the-- the final one alive that usually-- the final girl that-- that saves the day. Sam. Sam. Kill. Come on. Do it. And, Jamie, from what Sam says, that-- that sounds like you. No offense, Imani. Guys. What's happening? Um, Sam's getting the mask. Guys, run. Run! Do you know where we're going? Nope. I know where you're going. Imani, what the hell are you doing? We're not gonna be able to stop him. Well, it's not gonna help if you turn on me. I'm not sure there's much either of you can do to alter the course of these events. So it goes. No, Chuck, we can make this happen any kind of way. And I know I'm more equipped to kill Sam than Little Miss Perfect over here. OK, this isn't a logic problem, Imani. No matter how strong or smart you think you are, no matter how determined, you just can't outplay this. There's just no way that you're the pure soul that survives at the end of the day. I'm sorry. You just aren't. Yeah? Well, there's more to purity than meets the eye, and I know she's not this perfect image she shows everybody. Do you party? - Why? - Drugs, alcohol, caffeine even? No. Just face it, Imani. You're not a virgin, are you? That's personal. Yeah, so is life and death, baby. And it's down to me and you. - So are you a virgin? - Yes! Are you happy now? Nope. 'Cause that mean Chuck was right, and you. What's-- what's going on? Hello? Imani bought into what you were saying. What did you do? I acted first. OK. What do I do now? You-- you've got to kill Sam. He's right there. Sam? Sam? Hello? He's got the mask on. Then you should be running. No. I have to end this. Now. How are you gonna do that? I have a shovel. No. No, you can't possibly take out evil this powerful with a shovel. I'm sorry. You're just not. Then what am I supposed to do? You have to meet him on-- on the right field of battle. What does that mean? A place of power. What? OK. You-- you know at my work? The woodcarver's grave, where Sam found the mask. Just go there. I don't know where that is. OK. After Sam killed Drew, he-- he-- he killed Ted and Allison in a swimming pool. So-- so the grave must be around there somewhere. Run! Kill, kill, kill. Kill, kill. Kill. Sam? Hello? Sam? Sam? Sam? Sam. Hello? Hello? Chuck. Sam? I think I can conquer this thing. OK. I don't have to kill Jamie. OK. And she doesn't have to kill me. No, I know, OK. I know you think it's inevitable. But I'm gonna take this mask back to the woodcarver's grave, and I'm gonna end this. Sam, you know what? I-- I have some more old books in the back, like more arcane stuff. Maybe I can-- I can find a spell or something? There's no time. Well, can you give me like just five minutes or something? I'm not sure how much longer I can hold this power off. No, no, just-- just give me like five more minutes. Hello? Sam. Hello? Jamie. Sam! Get away from me. OK. It's me. No mask. I don't trust you. You're sick freak. But you have to believe me. How can I? See, I've got the mask. But to stop it-- see, I think I know how to stop it. The woodcarver's grave is that way. I'm going. You don't have to come with me. I'm not letting you out of my sight. OK. Hey. OK. Look, all right, this-- this is where we found the mask. And-- and I think-- I think this is where we need to bury it. Now it's-- it's OK. Nothing's gonna happen. We can end this right now. We can both walk out of here together. We just need to put this in the ground. I was gonna do it myself, but I just don't think I should be near this thing any longer than I have to be. I don't even think we should be seeing each other anymore. OK? Now let's put that shovel to good use. All right, all right. OK. Thank you, Jamie. Thank you. That's right. That's right. Just dig. Doesn't have to be too deep. You know, it's not-- sorry. You know what you're doing. You have a gift, Jamie. I'm lucky to have you-- I'm lucky to have you here doing this. Maybe don't touch it either, right? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Just, um-- maybe just dump it out. Just-- just just shake it out, OK? I don't even think I should see it. Jesus. Grab my keys. God. Is it out? I don't think I have much time. Put it on. Put it on. Do it. Do it now. All right, and just let me know when you're done because I don't want to risk seeing it. All right? You just let me know. Put it on. You good? How you doing? Just an appropriate size hole. Put it in the hole and bury it. Right? Then we'll be done. We'll be done. Now you just let me know when you're done. Just tap me on the shoulder or just whistle or-- or something so I don't risk look-- looking at it, OK? Jamie? Are you done? Jaime? Hello? Sam? It's over. I finished it. OK. May he rest in peace. Bye, Chuck. Sam, Sheriff James here. Just got in the office and I heard your voicemail and your friend's too. Look, I know you kids love messing around, but I don't think that land's something to joke about. Things have been good out there since your family took over, and I can't imagine you doing anything to screw that up, right? My granddaughter will be at camp this year, so keep an eye on her. I'll be sure to come by and make sure everyone's staying out of trouble. Bye, Sam. Rings of Saturn. This is Chuck. Chuck! I was on the hunt for blood. You were feeling lost in love. All it took was just one look and you were into me. I wish that I could cut you free. But you're already in too deep. You feel the curiosity of what we could be. Baby, if it's on, don't hesitate. I promise you I'll be your best mistake. You found me for a reason. Call it fate. Call-- call it fate. 'Cause it's feeling great. The night's about to get real. We're going in for the kill. This is power. It's not cold-hearted. And we're just getting started. We've been having so much fun. This night's been a thriller. Don't think about what we've done. You might be the killer. You can take your hands off me. This night's been a thriller. As long as you see what I see. You might be the killer. We've been having so much fun. This night's been a thriller. Don't think about what we've done. You might be the killer. You can take your hands off me. This night's been a thriller. As long as you see what I see. You might be the killer. Baby, after just one touch, I knew I'd never get enough. You should know I like it rough, but you'll get used to me. Baby, you can count me dead. Sleep by all the things you said. But, baby, you look good in red, so just keep killing me. We've been having so much fun. This night's been a thriller. Don't think about what we've done. You might be the killer. You can take your hands off me. This night's been a thriller. As long as you see what I see. You might be the killer. You might be the killer. And we're just getting started.
