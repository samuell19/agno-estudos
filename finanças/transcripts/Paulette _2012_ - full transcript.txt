[INTERREGIONAL PLUM TART CONTEST] [MY DREAM VILLA] [PASTRY MAKING DIPLOMA] Father Baptiste, I've sinned. I put roaches in the food of those Yellow bastards who took over my restaurant. Try to understand, Father. And God must understand me, too. Those Gooks, Arabs, Negros who invaded France... they stole our jobs. Come now, my daughter Don't get carried away by hate and anger. They are always bad counselors. I don't mean you, Father. You deserve to be white. I mean the Junglebunny with my daughter. And the Gooks who took over my restaurant. They drove Francis to drink. It ended up killing him. If your business failed... ...those who bought it aren't responsible. Don't make all foreigners scapegoats of your misfortune. Say 10 "Our Fathers" and 5 "Hail Marys". And don't do it again, Paulette. Never again! Buy my Périgord cheese! 5 euros for 5! Try this, Madame. You too, M'sieur. 5 euros for 5. M'sieur, try it. Plenty for everyone! Taste my cheese... Too cheesy! Let go ! I saw them first! What'll I eat tonight? - The phone... - What phone, Rashid? My sister's phone. What? An all expense paid week in Marbella, for her phone. Is it working? Why shouldn't it work? Home Decor Encyclopedias. I can see you're interested in interior decorating. Lucky, I'm here to tell you about... our promotion. This elevator busts my balls! Shit! Shouldn't we call Maintenance? Are you retarded? They don't come here anymore! My respects! I hope you'll be proud of me, honey. I hope it turned out well. Oh, yes, good! Not bad... 1, 2, 3... 8 PM in Paris, 2 PM in New York. Here is today's news on Sept 11, 2011. Tonight, we bring you a special edition on this very emotional date. What is the mood today? Cheers. 10 years already... If only you'd listened to me and kept off the bottle, we might not have lost our restaurant. It says "September 2001" on the walls of New York... 10 years since the World Trade Center... 3,000 dead... A sad date... 10 years ago... You'd think they're doing it on purpose! Why aren't they out working? The 35-hour week, retirement at 60 - what a joke! Hello, Mademoiselle. I didn't know your husband was my wife's neighbor. "Sept 11, 2001." Did he die in the Towers? Did your wife die because of an April Fool's trick? 21 Jan. 1945 - 1 Apr. 2004 Lazy bastards! Why not go out begging? Jérémy, wait! I stepped in shit! Fuck! Fuckin' pain! Jérémy, something's moving by itself. You smoke too much! What's he up to? There he is. Good evening, gentlemen. Tollbooth! It's all there. We gotta check. That's business. Francis, I've never seen so much cash. What is this? Thank you, young man. Have a great evening. You too. Goodbye. Hi, Mom. Say hello, Leo. Hello. - Hello who? - Nana. Don't want him to call me that. What should he call you? I'd rather he didn't call me. When will you be back? The want me to do overtime... What time! Around 5. That all there is? If you don't like it, don't eat it. I'd like a TV like that. A TV like what? Why don't you like me, Nana? Because you're black. You're Debbie, the new recruit, right? Yes. You can call me Deb. OK, what else? No new leads. Look at the DNA! Francis, this new cop is really dumb! It's not hard. DNA's everywhere, even on butt hair! I'm not home! Paulette, won't you let me in. No! My mother-in-law's a bit strange. What? Madame, I'm Cpt. Marchal. We have some questions about drug trafficking. Hi, Paulette. How long have you hired blacks to arrest drug traffickers? Don't mind her, she's always like that. We're on an investigation. I thought you could help us. We arrested a kid from this building. Jérémy - ring a bell? Thank you, but... Don't want any? No, I'm used to it. So, you've arrested Jérémy? Suspicion of trafficking. Trafficking? Trafficking what? Cannabis. Much money in it? In town, 4 - 500,000 euros a year. What? That little shit, 500 grand a year! He's just a dealer. We're after the big boss. A certain 'Vito'. Hello, Paulette. Coming to play cards? That's where it's happening! I shit on your card games! Madame Courtine, I'm appointed by the Court to seize your belongings... Go fuck yourself! Here. A year's outstanding payments on a loan, 2 years' unpaid gas and electricity bills, on your rent and service charges. You're not solvent, the court decided to seize your belongings. You can't! I'm on a minimum pension. So, we have... 2 reproduction armchairs, 1 standard lamp... Not my lamp! 1 TV, brand: Radiola. Not my TV! A dresser, style: country or rustic. Bunch of assfuckers! If you have a complaint, phone the Court. The number is on the paper I gave you. To make a bill Payment, say "Payment". It worked just now. Please repeat. I did not understand your selection. - Going out tonight? - To a party. Call the guys up, then. - Where is it? - In Paris. What's up, Granny? I want to see the boss. Who? Vito! What name? Get off me, Jigaboo! Say that again. Let her go! What d'ya want? To talk to Mr Vito, please. That's me. Who is it? Mr Vito, I know what you do. I want in. Oh yeah? What is it I do? I want to sell drugs. Hey Granny, you think this is a retirement home? Hold on! I ran a business for 35 years and very well, too! Go to bed, Granny, it's late. No idea what you're talking about. We thought you weren't coming. Hello, my little darling! - Peekaboo! - No! He'll need a dentist. I'm partners with Maria, you're with Renée. Renée? She can't recognize her own name! Paulette! What? It's true, isn't it? Yes, but we take turns. Hi, Walter! Ladies! That's all we needed! You're more resplendent every day. Mr Walter! It's true. OK, whose turn is it? Pass. You gonna bid today?... Where's Francis? Renée, just play. Remember, we played at the restaurant, before our shift? We should put her to sleep. She's just gonna get worse. Go on, play, Alzheimer! Ousmane, Yves, that way! Hurry! Now what?... Peek-a-boo! It's Granny Paulette... bringing you something you lost! You fucker! Go on, whack that ...! Square, triangle! Where d'you get that? In a trashcan. What trashcan? Listen, Mr Vito, I know that Jérémy and his pal sell drugs. I saw them. I promise I won't complain if you give me work. I can't afford to eat. I worked my whole life. She lives in Block Victor Hugo. There must an opening now that Jérémy's in jail. And the fuzz on your ass. The what? The cops. Who'd suspect me? Listen... Paulette. It's the first a little old ladywants to work for me. Maybe not such a dumb idea. I'll try you out. 90-10. 90% for me, 10% for you. It's a deal, Mr Vito. Know what to do? 5-gram bars. Want me to show you? No. What do you think I am? You nuts, Vito? Very clever, bro! Don't you get it? In business you gotta innovate Keep it down! What does this shit sell for, anyway? Francis, do you know? Ousmane, you have a visitor. Something wrong? Everything's fine. Why are you here? I came to say hello. - So, Osama... - Ousmane. Could you show me around a bit? I've never seen a police station. The thing is... Where's the stuff you confiscate? I dunno, like... contraband cigarettes, coke... Won't you show me, dear little Ousmene. 100 kilos! How much would that fetch? 200 to 250,000 euros. That much! Biggest bust we made ! And this? 5 kilos. 10,000 euros. Twice that, on the street. 5,000 grams, each worth... hm Know where I can get some hashish? What?! Hashish. - Hash! - I got it. You get stoned at your age? At my what? Never mind. By the station, in the underpass. - At your age it's not right. - Here's my age! Want some dope? Some what? Want some drugs? Hashish! M'sieur, you want drugs? You work for the cops? Hashish. You're a narc?!.. Man! No, I sell drugs. What're you doin'? Dealing? Who do you think you are, selling shit to grannies? I'm not. Go on, beat it! Piss off! If I see you dealin' here, I'll kick your head in! Beat it! How much for a bar? Well, 25 euros. 5 grams. I weighed it myself. I only have 20. Alright. Thanks! You here often? I'd rather buy from you than those kids who sell me crap. At least, I can be sure you don't work for the police. What an ass! - I hope it's not cut with tires. - Tires? Don't worry, grandma. If it's good, I'll be back often. Already? - It's all there. - Sure? Don't just stand there, get the shit! - 10%, right? - That's right. Thank you, Mr Vito. There! What is it, boy? What is it, "Delinquent"? Find it, "Delinquent"! Track him. Filthy beast! Track'im! Good boy! Get off me! Hold your slobbery mutt! Filthy beast! Hold your dog dammit! He knocked the lady over! "Delinquent" is on a trail. "Trail" ?!.. He's on my mother-in-law. No, I'll carry it. I'll manage alone. No, I insist. Heavy bag! What you got in it, hm? Drugs. Drugs?! No, it's OK. That's a good one! I didn't know you could be so funny. Well, thanks. I bet the elevator's out. I'll take it upstairs. Thanks a lot. You know, I'm really pleased... we can talk. Things improved between us. You stopped calling me a "filthy Black". - Can I ask you... - Yes? How much does a cannabis retailer earn? Paulette, open up! Oh, shit! If you don't open I'll call the super... Where have you been? We keep calling, but you never answer. You don't even come to play cards. Are you redecorating? It smells good. It smells really good! Not in there! What are you hiding? Someone's in there. Who? A man. Introduce us. He's not "visible". - You mean...? - Buck naked. All naked? I'll tell you later. Who do you think it is? The janitor? No, she can't stand him. Not Father Baptiste? No. Plus, he's black. Notice, they were doing it in the kitchen! It must be very physical. - Passionate. - And how! Walter ! No ! Why the fuck is she here? 1 euro a can! A can of tuna, 1 euro. 2 steaks, 1 euro! Shit, Afghan, ganja! - Good stuff? - Oh, yeah! I'll take it. Got the money? Piss off! You short changed me. You owe me 20 euro. Here. Later! Hi. Got more stuff? 5 bars for the price of 4. A bargain! Here you are. Never touch the stuff, Madame. Top-quality... When will you reconnect my phone? Tomorrow, or the next day. Not today? Your payment has to clear. Fucking trade unionist! Who's this? Come now, Renée... ...it's Paulette. I didn't recognize you. What's that coat? It's calfskin. The bag's new, too! From that guy, the other day? Who? You know very well, who. In the kitchen. Drop it. You're like the Fuzz! - The what? - "Fuzz". My respects, Miss. You're ravishing, today! It's him, the old fool! No, it's not him. Who, then? A young one. You heard how she speaks now! - Where are you going? - You promised to tell us. Later. Can't now. Body of Christ... Body of Christ... Father Baptiste, I've sinned. You put roaches in your neighbor's food? Worse than that, father. The sin of lust? No! Worse than that. What have you done, my child? I sold drugs. You sold what?! Hash, ganja... Paulette, you know it's forbidden! I know it's wrong, very wrong. A momentary lapse. Never do it again. I earn money, I meet people... I pay off my debts, I buy myself nice things... I feel as excited as when we had the restaurant. I want to make a donation. I want God to profit from it, too. Just put it in the box. I don't want to know. So that some "Sand Monkey" could snatch it! No, thanks! I'll give it directly to you. Paulette! What? Your collection at Mass won't pay for the new roof. Go on! Hallelujah! It's Granny Giggles! Go sell your shit! Don't go, Granny. You got good stuff. What's in your bag? What's your name, Granny Giggles! Give me your bag, Granny. Not so proud now, you old slut? What's with you? And you!.. You're French, dammit! Yeah, so?... Stop. Have you guys flipped? Shut your face! You said you'd just scare her. She's my grandma's age. She's poaching customers on our turf. Do we say nothing?! Piss off! Time to retire! Fuck off back to the farm, mind your cows! We don't need you, here. If I see you on our turf, I'll rip your head off! I'll end you! Stop ! Don't blow a gasket! What'll I tell Vito? "Those little shits swiped half my wad"? A 5-gram bar... A bit of tire... Not enough tire. What happened? Why are you wearing Dad's sunglasses? I have to work overtime, again. I won't keep the kid. I got no one! Should've thought about it before you got knocked up by a spade! And don't bug me! Where's the TV? If they ask, you know nothing! "How To Beat The Heatwave..." What a stink! This shit'll never work. What do you want? Please open up, Grandma. No! What smells? I baked a cake for my friends. Can I have some? No! Leo? Is this Mom? You're smiling. Looks like you're having fun. Leave that, you little shit! What did I do? You shit disturber! I didn't do anything! Open up or you'll get it! What are you doing? Leo, let me in. Please, sweetie... dear... You're mean! I was mean, yes. But I won't do it again. Come on... My little Leo, let me in, please. I shouldn't have got upset. I was wrong. I'm sorry. - Did you touch this? - Touch what? Don't tell your mother. What's so important in that box? If you like, Granny'll give you a big slice of chocolate cake, because you've been good. I don't want any cake. And I'm gonna tell Mom. Sweetie, I'd like us to get to know one another, see more of each other. Sometimes I may tease you, 'cause you're black. I'd rather you were white. That's just how it is. But deep down, I like you a lot. Rotten liar! I'll tell Mom! Just you wait and see! Granny! Quick... Water... Why are you mean to everyone? Why don't you like anyone? You saved my life, my little Pickaninny. Of course, you're my Nana. Sorry I'm late. Couldn't help it My battery died... No big deal. Was Nana mean to you? Did she hit you? No. Come on. You're wearing a ton of make-up, Paulette. Expecting someone? What's wrong? It's got an odd taste. Salt, pepper... Mm-sugar... And something, I don't know... What? I'd guess, cinnamon. You put cinnamon in it. With less sugar, salt and pepper, it'd taste different. Sill, it's not bad ! I'll have another piece. Choikan Restaurant? You hungry? We'd like 4 pizzas. The Japanese don't make pizza. No they do, but with raw fish! Or noodles! What's so funny? Tell us what you put in the cake. What is it? It's him. Mr Walter? Speaking. My heart's on fire. I want you so much! Stop it. Who is this? Come... I'm waiting! Stop messing around ! - Stop it! - Wait, wait. Miss Paulette! It's me, Walter! You've gone too far ! Francis, thanks to the little pickaninny, I think I found a way out. Pau... Agnes tried to reach you. She was worried. You look odd. Are you OK? 'Course. I just woke up, is all. It's 2 in the afternoon. Really? Thank you, Ousmana. You know her? Yeah, I know her! She said you had a tiny dick. - What? - Nothing in your pants, buddy. Where are you going? Didn't you get what I said? - I'm selling cakes. - Are they any good? - Paws off! - Are you crazy? Don't touch me! - Stop it, Zak. - What? Piss off ! You disrespect us and take our business. Who do you think you are? So you're in the cake business, now? "Mademoiselle" Zak, the baker! - Pick on someone your own size! - Is she your grandmother? Don't mention my grandmother! Why, what's wrong with your grandmother, camel face! Very funny, you clowns! Tasty Afghan shortbread! Giggle cakes! Afghan shortbread! Giggle cakes! Afghan shortbread! Got any shit? No, I bake cakes now. Cakes aren't my thing. Afghan shortbread! For you, I'll try one. How much for a shortbread? 20 euros. It's expensive! Well, it's extra labor... Plus, it's organic. Giggle cakes. How much? - 20 euros. - 20 euros?! - Can we sample them? - It's shortbread. Not at all, no samples. It's 5,000. How do you do it? Third time this week! Mr Vito, I have business training. A propos of which, it seems a dealer's percentage is 30-70 rather than 10-90. - Who said that? - It's not important. But next time, I want 30 or I'll go elsewhere. Mr Vito, you wouldn't take advantage of a penniless little old lady? - 25. - 30! - Can I help you? - I want a TV. Of course. Do you want... ...a 50 or 80 cm. screen? That one. That's the Ferrari of TVs. 156 cm., Full HD, Double speed progressive scan 3D, of course, but it's not for you. What's 3D? I want this one. Seen the price? Will you pay in 20 installments? 40 installments? Cash, you twat! 'Evening, Paulette. He asked where you lived. It's my girlfriend's birthday. She loves your shortbreads. I want her to have a blast with some really good stuff. For how many? 6 to 8. Come back tonight. - Granny Giggles... - ...and her killer cakes! Come in. What do you want? A dozen Afghan cookies. And Madeleines that get you stoned. Rachid, why'd you do that? They'll only deal with you. The others are real jealous. Pierrot's stirring up shit against you. Be careful, Madame. I'll tell you something. See these jerks... they both thought you wanted to screw me. I swear, she's crooked... Shut up, Pierrot! You never bring in this much. - And you... - My jacket! Keep cheating at "Infamous 2" and I'll break your fingers. Want a drink? No, Mr Vito, I'm not thirsty. 4 kilos this time. OK? What? A problem? Anyone bothering you? Tell me, I'll clean house right away! Don't be a jerk, Vito. Vito, calm down. - It's not that, Mr Vito. - What's the problem, then? I'm tired. You should've said. Momo, take the shit to her place. Take load off, guys. What's this, bro? What does the old bag want? Listen to her, 2 minutes. She's proposing a deal. What proposal? You'll see. Sit down. Not for me. Help yourselves, kids. Oven fresh! I think there's room for everyone. I'll handle pastrymaking, only. And I'll give you 10% for every customer you bring me. That way everybody's happy, no? This IS good! Shut up! Listen to him talk! The cake's good ! Admit it! Just 'cause WE don't bake... doesn't mean it won't bring new customers. It's great. We'd be screwing ourselves. Guys who get high on "Space Cake".. ...smoke less spliffs. But a full stomach, also makes you wanna smoke. And when you smoke, you want to eat. 15%. Alright. This busts my balls! Not even room to pass by! Cool ! Still getting stoned at your age! Know what my buddy says? "No age limit for toking up." I didn't understand a word. What's "toking up"? I'll tell you later. Later. Madame Paulette! Yes! Do you know Granny Giggles well? "Granny Giggles"? We know her whole family, even her grandson, Leo. Her daughter, Agnes. And her son-in-law, who's in the police. There you are. Thank you. Goodbye. Voila. What are you doing here? We are "miffed"! Like, "totally"! Madame doesn't come to play cards anymore. And when she does, Madame falls asleep. What's your little secret? I sell cakes. Imagine "The Bold and the Beautiful" on a TV like this! So, with your little cakes you bought that! Hm? Do you take us for idiots? No, I don't take you for idiots. I thought we were friends, but if you're afraid we'll steal your thunder, keep your little secrets. We'll find a fourth for our card game. Come, Renée. Don't go. You're my only friends! Very well. Spit it out! Remember the chocolate cake? Yes. The "ingredient", was "shit". Yes, hashish! You know, ganja, cannabis! Drugs! Ah! That was the funny taste! I know it's wrong, but I was fed up living like a bag lady. That's great, Paulette! You're so right! Sheer genius! Work more, earn more! 'Course, I never touch hard drugs! Of course not! Gran, how's it coming along? They seem impatient. I can't manage alone anymore. Wanna help me? We'll share. Do we ever?! Yes, coming! Afghan Shortbread. Paris Marrakesh. Ganja Sponge Fingers. Granny Giggles' Meringue. It's too quiet. Even the winos stopped drinking. Scuse me, dude. Where's Chez Paulette? [QUEBECOIS] No speak English... What'd she say? Yes, coming... come in. Hi, Paulette. We were in the neighborhood. We came to say hello. - Are you busy? - No. Bye, Paulette. Bye, guys. By the way, Paulette... Yes, goodbye. Your little business is doing quite well ! Everyone's talking about it. Not too legit... all this. Private premises, no license... You're not gonna nitpick with little old grannies who bake! What's in it? It's a secret, isn't it? Sure. Hey, thanks "bye", Paulette. That was good "Tabarnac"! [QUEBECOIS] - Piping hot! - What're you up to, Renée? What do you take me for, a dumb blonde? Madeleine..? - No, wait. - A meringue... - They're not done. - Waddaya mean, not done?! You can see they're not. So, how are things at home? Agnes sees only the black side. Yeah, well... Things are tense between us. And Leo's bearing the cost. No one's getting that? Yes, coming, coming! Hello. Granny, got any of those mind-blowing cakes? Meet "Osama" and his colleague. Policemen. They're investigating hashish trafficking in the hood. It's OK, Paulette. Don't let us put you out. Pretend we're not here. How's the investigation going? Seems like the dealers are on vacation. Right, Ousmane? What the hell are they doing here? Idriss and Momo, such nice kids. They run errands. I'll fuckin' smoke 'em! Cool it, we're at my mother-in-law's. Hands up! Mademoiselle Paulette's not in? Are you mental ? Excuse us, Monsieur. I just wanted to invite her to dinner. Mr Walter, Paulette will be delighted to dine with you. Isn't that so? - When? - In 1 hour. Sorry, gentlemen, Paulette has to get ready. Yes, of course. We won't keep you. This place? Yes. You know it? Come on, Paulette. Good evening. Mr Walter, we reserved you our best table. Thank you. Meet my friend Paulette. If you'd come this way. Been here before? Yes, Madame Paulette comes often. To unwind and let go of what "bugs" her! Paulette, to think we've been neighbors for so long! Tell me again what you saw! Fuck, I told you 20 times! We went to restock Paulette. 2 cops were there, having tea. And then? I'm sure she wants her neighbour to put his icing on her cake! Thanks for a splendid dinner. Paulette, I want you! I can't stand it anymore! You drive me crazy! Not tonight. - Why not? Not the first night. Why not? Huh? Paulette! Another time... maybe. Paulette! Screw her and be done with it! Are you angry, Francis? I swear, you've no reason to be. - Father Baptiste... - No, I don't wanna know. We can fix the church roof. God is grateful, but that's enough! Father Baptiste... I feel like I'm changing. At my age, it scares me. Me, who didn't like anyone -- I detested the Yellows, the Blacks-- I ate Chinese and it was good. I fraternized with that little Camel Jockey. I've reconciled with my Jungle-bunny and even my neighbor. The ways of the Lord are always impenetrable. You think so? I'm sure of it. What will my Francis think? I think he'll be very pleased to see you happy. Hallelujah! What about me? - How was the boat ride? - Really great. What's wrong? You're interested, now? I lost my job. It was bound to happen. I'd like nice clothes, too. Or weekends at the seaside. But my life is ugly and shitty. Always fighting with Ousmane. Here. This might help. Where'd you get this? We bake cakes. Me Maria and Lucienne. It's going well. I don't want your cash! Where were you when I gave birth? Why'd you never come to his birthday? Did you buy him ONE single gift! NOW you remember your grandson! Keep your damn cash! Agnes... Leave me alone, mom! I wanna play! Screw this "Sharon and Desi" shit! Shut up, you! That's a real woman! - Vito. - Now what? Taras wants to see Paulette. You shittin' me? I thought Ashley's breasts would be bigger. Flat as a board! Yes? You're here? Madame Paulette, would you follow me. Monsieur Taras is waiting. I'll be right there. Paulette. - Hey, Paulette. - Hi, Rachid. Hey, Paulette. Hello. Brown-noser! Watch your paws! Pow, pow! Paulette! She's clean, boss. Give him a right hook! Delighted to meet you. Who are these floozies... whores, or friends of yours? Give her the champagne.[RUS] Na zdorovia. Your health, Mr Taras. Babushka (grandma), sales have tripled, in a month. What's your secret? Mr Taras, if I tell you, it won't be a secret. Enough! [RUS] As my husband, Francis, used to say: "The trick is to vary the menu to increase the clientele." Hear that, Vito? Yeah, "vary the menu, to increase the clientele." Why didn't YOU think of that? Honestly, I dunno. Babushka, you take his place. - We'll take drugs beyond the ghetto. - Wait. You and me, we're going to expand the business. And me, Mr Taras? You? Fucking Taras! Dumps me in this shithole! Fuck, shit! ♪ She said go whistle ♪ there upon the hill ♪ And wait for her with a bouquet of eglantines ♪ I picked the flowers And whistled all I could ♪ I waited and waited ♪ She never came ♪ Zai zai zai zai... Kids love cakes. Imagine, Babushka... ...if we sell in kindergartens. Kindergartens? They'll soon be junkies. Then, crack, heroin, cocaine! A higher income level! Imagine the dough we'll make, Babushka! But, Mr Taras... What?... Chocolate buns! Kids love chocolate! Start on it tomorrow. ♪ Zai zai zai zai... Nana, what are you doing here? Who gave you this chocolate bun? Mom did. Know what? My friend's going to the seaside with his granny. Would you like to see the sea, pickaninny? You bet I would! Una cosa (one thing [SPAN]) Did the guy at Hertz tell you how many gears? 6, he said. 6? I can't find at least 2 of'em. Are you happy? What do I do? Try the red handle under the seat. The salon. The first bedroom. And here's the second bedroom. Mesdames, we wish you an excellent stay in our hotel. This is where we spent every summer. But... where's the house? We're too late, Alzheimer. Granny! Not too fast! Is this where you came with Mom? - Yes - It's beautiful. I'd forgotten how beautiful it was! No, Mom... If she was mean, I'd tell you. No need to ask. Sure you won't be scared alone? No, my pickaninny's not scared. Why'd you act mean for so long? You're not as mean as that! Be careful, though! Y'know, if we're here, at all, it's thanks to you. Paulette... I'll tell you when you're grown up. Mr Taras, I thought it over. I wouldn't touch your "cakes for kids caper". Why? Because I think it's wrong. Know what, Rusky? Get bent! How about a drive along the coast? Just us two. Piss off! 7, rouge, impair. (red odds) You're very lucky! - What's your name? - Alzheimer! You OK, my little Leo? Time to go back home, now. What happened? Francis... Is there a problem, Mr Vito? You could say a "slight" problem. Taras hates it when people hang up on him. What are you gonna do? We'll burn your feet with a blowtorch. Then, we'll cut you up into little bits. Right, Vito? - We have your snotty kid. - My pickaninny! Listen, Paulette, do everything Mr Taras wants. Or I'll grind the kid into Merguez (sausage)! Don't hurt him, I beg you, Mr Vito. He has nothing to do with it. Her birthday? No, she took Leo to the seaside. Paulette. Watch it, it's the police. Open up! If you don't open, I'll call in SWAT and they'll smash your door! One... Paulette? Paulette? Don't forget your grandson. Keep your mouth shut!.. Let's go! Pardon me. - What happened? - Nothing. - Nothing? You've been robbed! - No. I'll get a patrol here, now. No, Ousmane, there's no need. A gust of wind slammed some doors and knocked over a few trinkets. A gust?... More like Katrina! It's fine, really. - You sure, Paulette? - Absolutely, thanks for dropping by. I just have to tidy up now. Tidy up. I think they're bluffing. Leo can handle himself. They mean business. Mom, open up! Is he here? - Who? - He's not? - Who? - Leo, dammit! He disappeared after school. I thought he was here. Vito kidnapped him. Who's Vito? Our drug supplier. We started dealing hashish. That imbecil, Vito, thought we were double crossing him. So, he kidnapped the kid to blackmail Paulette. What? I'll call Ousmane. No, don't do that. They might hurt the kid. Who is it? Tell me where the kid is. Or we'll eat your balls! Momo, what the fuck's up? What's going on? What's this shit? Fuck you doin'? Don't play with fire, Paulette. Don't fuck around, Vito, they're mean. - Not so smart now! - Drop it. We'll talk. - Free the kid first. - The hell you say! - "Not negotiable!" - What? Les Experts: Manhattan (CSI: NY) Now what? Untie him! I don't give a fuck if I die! - Untie the kid. - Seriously? Do as I say, dammit! Granny! Run fast, pickaninny. Where the fuck's Momo? Dunno where the fuck he is. Yeah. OK, Taras. Babushka, why won't you be reasonable. Mr Taras, never... Never will I lace cakes with "shit" for kids my grandson's age. Vito. Yeah. Got it, Taras. Idriss, the blowtorch. Oh, fuck, what a mess! What did you tell the fuzz? Mr Vito, I'd never rat to the police. Anyway, it's not my fault... ...if my son-in-law's a cop. Are you taking the piss? Stop! At the moment, my daughter is having domestic trouble. So he came over to discuss it. Ever had couples' problems, Mr Vito? Shut up! Drop your weapon! Don't move! Go on, move! I'll deal with this myself. Your act, back at the apartment, made me suspicious. Do you know about the cakes? What cakes? Vito says you're the dealers. He has proof. Is that true? I know, Francis, I shouldn't have. You've been gone 10 years. How can I get by on 600 euros a month? How? I'll miss my pickaninny. I've become attached to him. Free Paulette! Free Paulette! Free Paulette!

As you see, the court's decision was welcomed by the defendants' supporters and has calmed tensions... What'll we do without the cannabis? No more vacations, shopping, and restaurants.
