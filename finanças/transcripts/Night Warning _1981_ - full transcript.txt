Yeah, (door squeaking slamming shut) You're a good boy, come with me now when Mommy and Daddy go. Be good, son, back in a couple of weeks. Don't forget to tell me if they like the preserves. Oh, you're so sweet. (quiet piano music) You be good now, Billy. Don't give Auntie Cheryl any trouble. You be careful. Mommy and Daddy are going over the mountains all the way to the Pacific coast to see Grandma and Grandpa. Remember, we had to change hotels in Cedar City. Bye, Daddy. Bye. Good-bye. Good-bye, Mommy. Bye-bye, Honey. (baby sobbing) Bye! Bye-bye. (child screaming) I love you. (baby sobbing) (sinister music) (upbeat music) [Car Radio Announcer] The champs, the Packers, and what a game. The mighty Green Bay Packers, who have dominated the National Football League for the past few years with an unprecedented three consecutive NFL championships, were the winners of the first Super Bowl, defeating the Kansas City Chiefs by a score of 35 to 10. For many, the Packers win came as no surprise. Billy looks so cute in that baseball cap you bought him. I miss him already.

(purring) Five more minutes. Okay, Billy. But you're beginning to make this a habit. Gonna have to start getting you up earlier. Five more minutes. Right. (door clicks shut) (birds chirping) Yeah! (lid slams down) (peaceful music) (birds chirping) (knife chopping) (ball bouncing) (knife chopping) Billy, don't eat that now! I just made you breakfast. Well can't you freeze it? I gotta pick up Julie on my way to school. What am I going to do with you? What's the matter? Do you see this? This is a glass. We use this for drinking. Why dirty a glass? (birds chirping) (quiet music) I was thinking, can I invite Julie over for my birthday dinner? Julie again? Sounds serious. I think she's got a crush on me. She does? Billy's got a girlfriend, Billy... Billy! Don't do that, that's disgusting. I am going to be your date tomorrow night. Sorry. Whatever makes you happy. I'll see you tonight. You make me happy. (door slams shut) (ball bouncing) (bright music) Yeah. (motorbike buzzing) (quirky music) (motorbike revving) (ball bouncing) (sneakers squeaking) (camera shutter clicking) (whistle blowing) That's fine, that's fine, that's fine! You guys look like a basketball team! All right, c'mon, set 'em up now, set 'em up! (teammates chatter) All right, let's go, let's go, shoot the other way now! (whistle blowing) (excited team chatter) Pass the ball, c'mon! Hey, that's a foul! Foul! You only say foul, because you're trying to dribble through him now! Eddie, you gotta move the ball to back, you can't dribble through the guy. C'mon let's go, let's bring it back. Let's go, shirts! Shirts ball, get back! Watch your back door! All right, you traveled now, let's go, let's go back the other way, here we go! Set 'em up, set 'em up, here we go, c'mon! Get 'em up, that's right. C'mon! C'mon, Eddie, play some defense, son! (whistle blowing) All right, that's good, that's good, good job. (clapping) Now get out of here, I'm tired of looking at 'ya. It's a good practice, Russ. Billy, can I talk to you for a second? Sure. Good practice, looking good, good, all right. Listen, Eddie, I gotta talk to Billy for just a second. Listen, I'll talk to you tomorrow, all right? Go work out. I got some great news for you. I'd like you to meet me in my office right after you shower, all right? Hey, check it out. Look at him, will you? The coach's number one wimp. Gee Julia, I gotta meet Coach after I shower. Oh, that's okay. Thanks. (kiss smacks) C'mon, let's go inside. (ball thumps) Hey, Lynch. Next time keep your queer hands off of me, okay? I don't like to be touched. Knock it off, Eddie. I didn't foul you. Bull! Hey, what are you getting so hot about, now, huh? We're on the same team. Yeah, I know. It's just that some of us think we're better than others. Some of us are better than others. We'll find out about that. Oh thanks, Cheryl, you're a life saver. Hope he wasn't too much trouble. No, he's good as gold. (car horn beeping) Just a minute, Frank. What about tomorrow night? Do you need any help? No Marge, I'm okay. Okay. Listen! Frank knows this guy at work. 35 years old, a real hunk. Margie, I'm not interested in dates, blind, or otherwise. (car horn beeping) In a minute, Frank! You know, Billy's gonna be 17- Bye, Margie. You're gonna need a man around the house! Oh, I know, I know. See you tomorrow, thanks for the pickled tomatoes! (car horn blaring) I am coming! (birds chirping) (quiet, suspicious music) (footsteps clicking) (handle clicking) (door banging) (suspicious music) (loud bang) Gotcha! (camera clicking) Julie, I hate it when you do that. What are you doing here, anyway? Well, I thought that you'd think- You thought that I was going- You think, forget it. All right. What took you so long? I had to meet with Coach Landers. For an hour? It's 6 o'clock. Oh, six. Hey listen, Julie, can I talk to you later? See I didn't call Aunt Cheryl, and you know how she gets about dinner. Call her now. I can't, I gotta go home. There's something I gotta talk to her about. Okay, I didn't mean to upset you. I'm sorry. How about I give you a ride home on my moped? Billy, I'm wearing a skirt. You can ride side side-saddle with me. (dog barking) You are late. And I'm fixing your favorite. The meat sauce will never forgive you. I had to take Julie home. I had a long talk with Coach Landers this afternoon. He's got great news! Oh. Yeah. See he thinks I can get a full scholarship to the University of Denver. And there's a scout, he's coming out to our next game. Well, what do you think, huh? What do I think? Forget it. You got a job next year, I've set it all up. Yeah, but this is a full athletic scholarship! Denver, that's where Julie's going, isn't it? Yeah. (pan clattering) Gee, that'd be nice. College is for rich kids and people with brains. You wouldn't fit in there. You never said that before. (faucet running) You always said we couldn't afford it. You didn't say you didn't want me. Well, I don't want you to! We can't afford it. Besides, I thought you were gonna stay here and contribute something. All we have left is Mommy's house. But I was figuring you'd sell this place. It's too big for you, anyway. All my life, I've lived in this house. All my memories are in it. And they're not for sale. And as far as I'm concerned, you owe me. For the past 14 years I've sacrificed everything to bring you up. Aunt Cheryl! You're the man of this house- (screaming) (pan crashing) You're staying here, and that's it! You're taking that job! I'm gonna get that scholarship if I can! I'm going away to school, and no one's gonna stop me! Not even you! (loud slap) (quiet, dramatic music) You upset me. (dogs barking) (pan crashing) I'm gonna go upstairs and lay down, cook your own meal! (dogs barking) (rooster crowing) (door squeaking) (quiet music) (footsteps clicking) (rooster crowing) (quiet music) (Cheryl whispering to herself) I don't care. Extra sugar, I can't stand it, that's for you. (sobbing exhale) So afraid. Chuck, I don't know why. It's just a birthday. One more and he'll be gone. (chair squeaking) Something will happen. He'll see I need him. (door clicking open) (birds chirping) Billy? (Billy moaning) Billy? Wake up. Hi. Good morning. Happy Birthday Thanks! I thought after last night- Sshh! Read the card. "For my nephew on his birthday. "Some extra special love. "P.S., good luck with the scholarship." Hey! Took me some time to understand it, that's all. You're terrific. You know what we both need? Is a big cup of coffee, I'm exhausted. Oh, before I forget, stop by Brody's TV Repair before school, will you? We paid $38 to have the set fixed and it still won't work. Why can't you call him? You know him. Tell him I want him here this afternoon. I have to go shopping this morning. Buy someone a present. (door clicks shut) I can't believe it! A scout from the University of Denver, from my school is coming here. You didn't even tell me! Well, that's why I was so long with Coach Landers yesterday afternoon. Oh! There you go. It's your birthday. Oh, thanks. So why didn't you tell me then? Well, I wanted to run it by Aunt Cheryl first. Excuse, guys. So what did Aunt Cheryl say? How'd she take it? Well, she's working it out. It's too good to be true. I feel like it's my birthday. I haven't got the scholarship yet. You will! Oh, I forget. Happy Birthday! (Cheryl humming) (big sigh) (humming) (sinister music) You're leaving now? Yeah, I finished. Don't go. Lady, you got to be kidding me. I'm gonna give you a (indistinct). Look Lady, I'm just not interested, okay? (moped revving) (dogs barking) I won't tell, I promise! (sinister music) I can't believe this. Please! I need a man! Well, it's not gonna be me! Please! I'll let you do anything to me you want! All right. How 'bout you doing me? Work on it. (slapping) You stupid bitch! (shuffling) (dogs barking) (sinister music) (wailing exclamation) (screaming) (dogs barking) (sinister music) Cher, what? What'd you do? (sobbing) You saw him, he tried to rape me. You saw him, you saw him! He tried to rape me! (sobbing) Billy, Billy! You saw him, you saw him! (dogs barking) (door slamming) Frank, let me have the cake. If I know you, you'll drop it. Thanks. I hope she likes it, it's a new recipe. Oh, and Frank, be sure to say something about her pickled tomatoes. They were terrible. Frank, if you can't say something nice, don't say anything. I won't say anything. Good! Well, you think she could put a porch light on, you break your neck- Give me your arm. For crying out loud. Where's the bell? Just knock real loud. (knocking) Well where is everybody? (clock ticking) (door creaking open) Cheryl, Billy! You-hoo! (sinister music) Hello? Hello, hello? Hello? (Cheryl sobbing) Oh my God! Oh, Shit! (screaming) (eerie music) (sobbing) (muffled police radio chatter) (bag zippers) Okay to remove the body? Yeah, go ahead. You buy attempted rape? No. Do you? No. It wasn't his day. Poor guy didn't even get his pecker out. (laughing) Yeah. How are the twins? They're fine, Joe. You gonna have that operation? What operation? The snipping. Hell, no. Billy, how long had you been home before they arrived? We've already been through this. Let's go through it again. I already told you. You gonna tell me again, son. Well I came home just before they got here. And then what? Well, I was coming up the back stairs, and I heard some voices in the kitchen. So I looked through the window. And then I seen this guy hunch over my aunt. So I went in to help her. To help her. That's very good, Billy. That's exactly word-for-word what you told me before. Did she help you memorize all that? No. Did she? C'mon tell me the truth, son! Did she? You stupid bully, he's telling the truth! Why you doing this to us! Because there's a dead man laying out there, and I wanna know why he died. I killed him! He tried to rape me! If it's a hollering contest you want, you're sure as shit gonna loose. Be nice to me, lady. He tried to rape. I disagree. There isn't a bruise on a you. Your clothing hasn't been torn. And these two walk in and find junior here holding the knife. It's interesting, folks. (bag zippering) Hold it, Cook. Are you all right? I don't know. I feel kind of scared. Honey, everything's gonna be all right. No, don't! Billy! I just need some air. Maybe you should go with him, Frank. I don't think I better. He's all right. He's just disappointed. He won't be able to go away now. Hold it, Billy! Where you going? Outside on the porch. Stick around. Come back. Did you, or your aunt, know Phil Brody? Well yeah, he's been here a couple of times. We didn't know him. You didn't know him? But you knew him? Turn around. What? Turn around! (clock ticking) Did you actually see Phil Brody try to rape your aunt? Yes! I'm shy, I can't hear you. Yes. Between you and me, Billy, did you kill him? No! Right. Miss Roberts! (explosion) Miss Roberts, would you come in here? I wish he wouldn't yell. You know, you don't have to go through this, you have your rights. He's got to understand that I killed him. (footsteps clicking) (clock ticking) Thank you, Miss Roberts. I thought you were going outside. I changed my mind. You do make a lovely couple. I wanna ask you a couple of questions. Please have a seat. May I have a seat? Thank you. Now you said you weren't married, is that correct? Yes. Are you divorced? No. Widowed? No. But you do have boyfriends? No. Do you like girls, Miss Roberts? God, you're a pig. Just sick. Why don't you stop tormenting her? Are you talking to me, lady? Yes. Don't. Billy, where are your parents? They're dead. Let the boy answer. Well, my aunt's been taking care of me since I was three. Just the two of you in this big old house? It must get awfully lonely. No, we're good company for each other. I bet you are. You claim attempted rape. I took at little peek at this fellow, Brody. It seems to me that was fairly athletic fellow. How come he didn't just pin you down on the sofa? He tried, but I got away. Now you said he touched your booby. What else did he do? I refuse to answer any more of your questions. Lady, I don't give a shit what you do. Lieutenant, I'm leaving now. Then go ahead and leave, Cook. (clock ticking) Fascinating. (click ticking) (moped revving) (birds chirping) (footsteps clicking) (birds chirping) (door creaks open) (Cheryl whispering to herself) (screaming) (deep exhale) I thought you had practice this afternoon. Well, we had a short session. Oh. Kind of warm for a fire, isn't it? I'm cleaning out the attic. This junk has been around here for years. I thought I'd make you a little apartment loft out of that space upstairs for next year. Well, I might be going away to- You're gonna like it when I finish, you'll see. Don't go up there until I tell you to, okay? Well, what's wrong with- Promise! Sure. Hey, by the way, did Detective Carlson call today? No, maybe he's forgot about us. No, he was at school. And he still wants me to take the polygraph test. I do not approve of you taking that test, and I do not wanna discuss it again. Is that clear? Sure. (clock ticking) (papers shuffling) (Cheryl whispering to herself) (birds chirping) (footsteps clacking) (eerie music) Shit! (eerie music) (papers rustling) (rat squealing) (eerie music) (rat squealing) (banging, bumping, crashing) (footsteps stomping) (eerie music) Good Lord, what happened to you? Are you all right? I'm okay, I just tripped, I'm all right, I'm all right. Why are you only fully coordinated on the basketball court? You shouldn't had been up there anyway. I know. (sinister music) Who is that? Who is that? What's the matter? It's, just some twerp your mother used to go out with. Chuck Strang, his name was. (quiet music) Clean all this stuff up for me, will 'ya? Okay. (quiet music) All right, John, take it up to basket, take it up to the basket. Ledge, why don't you save that fancy stuff for EU, huh? (ball bouncing) C'mon, Tony! That's great, Tony, that's great. You look real pretty, the shot hit the goal. (players chattering) Coach Lander? Yeah? I'm Detective Carlson, I need to talk to you. Yeah, we're in the middle of a drill, can it wait for about five minutes? No, it can't. Is that Billy Lynch out there? Yeah, that's Billy. It's remarkable how tough today's youth is. I mean, take Billy, just a couple of days ago, he witnessed a particularly gruesome killing. And take people in general. I mean, there are people today who loose a loved one, and seem totally unfazed by it all. I know it's your ring, Coach. What is it? Does it surprise you much, if I had to make good? I found this ring on Phil Brody. The man who got killed. Inside it says, "To P.B." I take that to be Phil Brody. "From T.L." And I take that to be Tom Landers. Yeah, that's you. Yeah. (ball bounces) How does Billy fit into this? Well it doesn't figure into this, Carlson. I've coached the kid four years, and I've watched him become a real good ball player, and I care about him. I don't doubt that. I suggest you resign. If you don't, chances are you're gonna get yourself lynched. (laughing) Yeah. You have a nice afternoon. Hey, Carlson! (ball bouncing) (Cheryl whispering to herself) (sinister music) (banging and crashing) (sinister music) (eerie music) Hi! I had to tear the wall down. You're the only one I can talk to. Billy's not going, I fixed it. He's gonna stay here with us. Everything's going so wrong. I just wanted to show Billy I needed his protection. I didn't mean to kill that man. But he hit me, he hurt me. Just like you did. (knocking) Miss Roberts? (eerie music) (door squeaks open and shut) (eerie music) (clock ticking) (Cheryl screaming) What the hell are you doing in here! Easy, lady. What do you think you're doing? I, I, I knocked, nobody answered. Do you have a search warrant? I heard a noise, I just thought something was wrong. The only thing that's wrong is you're in my house. Now get out of here! Now look- Get out! I just- Get out! I just wanted to talk to you. I don't wanna talk to you! Now get out! All right, all right. Get out! (door slamming) (screaming) (labored breath) Hey Lynch! Did you hear about your buddy, the Coach? (snickering) Yeah, Eddie. Kind of interesting. Billy, ignore him. You were always in Lander's office. I always thought you guys were... You know. What? Real close, Lynch. I mean, real close. Billy! (laughing) Oh, shit! (punching thud) Billy! (punching thud) Billy! (scuffling, moaning) (group yelling) Hit him hard! Hit him hard! Get him! I'm gonna kick your ass, Eddie. I'm gonna kick it! Billy! (threatening, scuffling) I'm gonna kill you, Eddie! (moaning) Let go of him! I'm all right. Yeah. (ball bouncing) Nice shot. That was a lucky shot. You got technique, pal. Damn good moves on the basket. Coach Landers teach you those? Yeah. Doesn't it bother you that he's a fag? C'mon. Tell me, Billy, are you a fag? No! I'm gonna ask you again. And keep it mind that it pisses me off when people lie to me. Are you a fag? You're crazy. Phil Brody, remember him? The man who got wasted here? Well he was a fag. And it doesn't make a whole hell of a lot of sense for a fag to be raping your aunt, now does it? It does make sense if you are a fag, too. Now I'm just postulating. (quiet, dramatic music) But I believe that you and Phil Brody were having a lover's quarrel. And the thing got a little out of hand. And your aunt walked in and saw you with a knife in your hand, and decided to take the wrap. Isn't that the way it happened, man? You filthy pig! You think you got it all figured out, don't you? Well, you're wrong! Maybe. You do that, Billy, so help me, God. I'll break your arm. On your outside jump, stay loose. Helps. And your wrist, keep it limp, like. That shouldn't be too difficult for you. (utensils scraping) (peaceful music) (crickets chirping) You know what they don't teach you in school? What? How confusing and difficult life can be sometimes. You really don't understand, do you? Billy, everything's gonna be all right. It's not all right. Carlson doesn't believe us. He thinks he can prove I did it! No, he can't. We won't let him. You're not making any sense. Did you know that Coach Landers was a homosexual? No. Billy? No! Do you know that homosexuals are very, very sick? Do you know that, Billy? Coach Landers is not sick! Billy! Billy! Hey, Billy. Yeah? Aren't you gonna say hello? Don't you mean goodbye? I heard you quit. Why you leaving? Look, this is something that I'm gonna have to fight in my own way. And I just didn't wanna be here when I did it. Carlson came over yesterday. He told my aunt you were gay. Don't you worry about it, okay? I know. You know what? He also says he can prove that I killed Brody. Look, don't let it worry you, all right? I'll go check it out. And man, listen, if there's anything that I can do, all right, you call me? Sure, Coach. Any time. Yeah. Take care, partner. You, too. Take it easy. See 'ya, Bill. Rapes are 18%. What the hell are you people doing out there? Child molestation is up 3%. I want all these fucking deviants off the street. Pronto? Y'all got that? What are you doing here, Nancy? Fuck you! And fuck you! God-damn hookers. All right, I don't want anything. That's right, it's just you and me, ain't it? Here, you want a cookie? (drawer slams shut) (knocking) Landers, I was just talking about you. (chuckling) Yeah. Billy Green. Does the name ring a bell? No? One of two young boys molested last night. I figured you might know something about that. Well, it was just a thought. I understand you resigned. Smart move. Good for everyone. What do you want? I forgot to tell you something, Carlson. What? Phil Brody used to be married. That means that Cheryl Robert's story might possibly be true. Why you telling me this? I thought it might help you. Help me? (laughing) Or help your phat boy, Billy. Carlson, what's your problem? People like you. Get the fuck out of my office. Deviant, Mackie, you know what that is? (dog panting) Fucking deviant. The world is full of 'em. Oh hey, I'm sorry about the last couple days, you know? I mean, it's been pretty rough. But you gotta let me work it out on my own. Well, are you? No. But you're sure you don't wanna be helped. Everything's so screwed up. Do you wanna talk about it? No, not here. What are you doing tonight? What about Aunt Cheryl? Oh, she's going to Sedona with Margie and Frank. She won't be home till later. It's about time. (dog barking) Thunder, calm down. (dog barking) I'm fine. Mother! Would you call Thunder upstairs? (dog barking) (Julie screaming at dog) Sorry. Okay, I like dogs like that. Can I help you? Are you Julie Linden? Mm-hmm. I'm Lieutenant Carlson. I need to talk with you. It's kind of private, do you mind taking a walk with me? Okay. Thank you, thank you. (door rattles shut) How long have you and Billy been going steady? About a year. Is it serious? It is to me. He's very special. Well he certainly has had an unusual background. Do you find his relationship with Aunt Cheryl a bit peculiar? I guess, I don't know. How's Billy with you? I mean, is he strong, aggressive, kind of? Lieutenant, you seem to have something on your mind. I'd like to know what it is. I need to know if you two are making it. That's none of your business! A man got killed. Supposedly by a woman who's claiming attempted rape. The man was a homosexual, an acquaintance of Billy. I have a responsibility to find out whether or not Aunt Cheryl is covering for Billy. And whether or not he's a homosexual, too. That's ridiculous! So tell me, are you two making it? I'm not going to answer that. Julie? I think you just did. He's more of a man than you'll ever be. Humph, okay. (dog barking) (crickets chirping) (footsteps crunching) (eerie music) Hey, you want something to drink? Sure. I'm on my way. (chuckling) Hurry back, okay? Okay. This house gives me the creeps. (footsteps crunching) (eerie music) (eerie music) (crickets chirping) Billy, I didn't wanna tell you this, but I don't feel right keeping it from you, either. What is it? More bad news? Not bad news, exactly. That Detective Carlson came by my house, and he asked me some questions. Like what? General stuff, mostly. And he asked me, how many, how often we make love. What did you tell him? That it was none of his business. Good. How come we haven't more often? Billy, is there something wrong? Something you wanna tell me? No. Yeah. You have a terrific body, you know that? You really do. And you're really sexy. (eerie music) (lips smacking) (deep breathing) (eerie music) Billy! (door slams open) You get dressed and get that slut out of here! (dogs barking) (door slamming) (dogs barking) (mysterious music) (footsteps clicking) (Julie screaming) Sergeant Cook, homicide. Oh Jesus, you scared me! I'm sorry. What are you doing here? Well, actually, I came to ask Miss Roberts some questions, but I'd like to talk to you, if you don't mind. Did she catch 'ya? You might say that. Well that's good. That's good for Billy's case. You see there's kind of a strong feeling that he's- I know. Are you finished? Yeah. So am I. Okay. (shower running) Billy, I wanna talk to you! Well, I don't! Okay! Billy! Do you mind! I want you to promise me that you will never do that again! Hand me a towel. Jesus, Aunt Cheryl, I'm 17 years old! And it's not the end of the world! I want you to listen to me! No! Do you promise? Okay. That's a good boy. (shower running) (door slamming) God! (quiet music) Perverts and sluts! They're doing everything they can to take him away from us. Did you know that he's still thinking of leaving? (sobbing) Sure you did. You know everything, don't 'ya? But he won't, 'cause I'm gonna keep him here. The same way I kept you here. He'll never leave us. Cook, walk with me. Julie Linden's mother called and complained about you scaring the shit out of her daughter. What were you doing out there? Well, I was just checking. See, I don't think that Billy Lynch had anything to do with the murder. I kind of see it different. Oh, is that right? And how is that? Well for one thing, Miss Roberts caught Julie and the boy in the sack together. That kind of weakens the fag theory. The victim was a fag. The coach is a fag. And the kid is a fag. He grew up without a father, with only women around. It's a classic case, Cook. All right, all right. There's something else. This is from the "Flagstaff Courier", September 12, 1967. Bill and Ann Lynch, the boy's parents, were killed yesterday outside Flagstaff when their car crashed into a logging truck on Interstate 89. The cause is thought to have been brake failure. Now I talked to a few of the locals, and they remembered that there were rumors about the brakes being tampered with. Cook, I hope you're doing this shit on your own time. Because I forbid from doing it on department time. Incredible. Schmuck. (milk pouring) (quiet music) (quiet, sinister music) (crickets chirping) (spoon scraping glass) (quiet, eerie music) Billy, can I talk to you? Is it important? I'm in a hurry. It's very important. Billy, please? Come sit down. I thought you'd like a glass of milk, some of your favorite chocolate chip cookies for good luck. I mean it, Billy. I know how important tonight is for you. I want you to know that if you get that scholarship, I'm behind you, 100%. (footsteps clicking) Good luck tonight, Billy. (crickets chirping) I know you're in a hurry, take these with you. Mm, thanks. Go get 'em. I'll be there. (giggling) See you later. Bye! (cheerleaders chanting) (spectators applauding) Good luck! Thanks! The scout from Denver's here, I know you'll get it. I hope so. I'm feeling kind of dizzy, but it's a hell of a time to come down with something. Don't worry, you'll be all right! (spectators applauding, cheering) (buzzer) (spectators cheering, applauding) (whistle blowing) (spectators cheering, applauding) (ball pounding floor) (spectators cheering, applauding) (ball pounding floor) (spectators cheering, applauding) (whistle blowing) (spectators cheering) (cheerleaders chanting) (mysterious music) (muffled arena noises) This way, it's a point shot, all right?

Take it easy, all right. Take your time. Take it easy. I'm okay, okay, okay. (crashing to floor) (dramatic music) Billy! Billy, honey, honey. Honey? We're going home. (birds chirping) (Billy moaning) (birds chirping) Hello, there! Welcome back! You've been sleeping on and off for 14 hours. (eerie music) Where am I? Remember I told you the attic could make a nice little apartment for you? Well, you like? I guess so. I knew you'd be thrilled. What happened at the game? Honey, you slipped, or something. You had a nasty fall. You hit your head hard. (eerie music) What time is it? Noon. Oh my God. Where do you think you're going, young man? School. I promised I'd meet Julie by one o'clock. Did anybody call? No, no one called. You stay right here. You don't wanna go back there anyway, Billy. You learned enough. Besides, it's full of perverts. You stay here with me, I'll teach you things. Oh, look what I found when I was cleaning up. (eerie music) Look. (metal clinking) Your father gave this to your mother when they got married. (birds chirping) I don't, you- She had it on when she died. No! All right. I'll put it in here for you. (box snapping shut) Hungry? Sort of. Why don't I come down? You stay right there, you need your rest. I'll bring you something up. You can get washed if you want to. Whoop! You're so cute. (door snapping shut) (Cheryl humming) (birds chirping) (eerie music) (sinister music) "Dear Cheryl, "even though we've only know each other for two weeks, "I know this is the start of something very special-" (tray crashing) What do you think you're doing? Nothing. I'm just looking. You're lying! You're going through my private belongings. That's very rude! I don't want you to ever do that again! Why didn't you tell me the truth? About what? Chuck Strang was your boyfriend, not my mother's! Honey! (sobbing) Phil Brody didn't try to rape you, did he? Billy! He did! You know he did. You saw it! Aunt Cheryl, there's something wrong. You're lying to me. Why would I ever wanna lie to you? Lock her up. Sit down. Donde? Ay, yah. Sit down on the fucking floor. Donde es su casa? Aqui. Bullshit! Donde es su casa en Mexico? Joe? What? I got some more information on Cheryl Roberts. Could you do me a favor and keep it to yourself? The more I find out about that woman, the stranger she gets. She dated a guy in high school named Chuck Strang. An older guy, not a local. One day he just disappeared. Left his clothes and everything. Hasn't been heard of since. You look tired, Cook. You need some rest. Go on home. As a matter of fact, I don't even mind if you go on vacation! (eerie music) (scissor snipping) That's better. (eerie music) (Cheryl whispering to herself) (footsteps clicking) (birds chirping) Stop it, you! You're always teasing me. I know, I cut it off. You made me! (indistinct) You're happy, aren't you? Just you and me, and Billy. No one's every gonna take him from us. (deep exhale) I feel so good. (eerie music) Don't you? (eerie music) You gotta help me. She hates me, she won't talk to me. Well yeah, she will. If you go up to the house, you can distract her for a few minutes, then I can find out what's in that jewelry box. Okay. (suspenseful piano music) (birds chirping) (knocking) Miss Roberts? (birds chirping) (eerie music) (door creaks open and shut) (door creaks open and shut) Miss Roberts? (eerie music) Miss Roberts? What are you doing in here! I told you that Billy is under doctor's orders to rest! I know, I didn't come to see him. I came to apologize. I don't want any apologies from you! I am inviting you to get out of here! No! Not until I said what I came to say! You can talk till you're blue in the face. I saw you the other night. I know what you do. (eerie music) (plate rattles) I hope you're not gonna make me throw you out of here. (hammer pounding) Miss Roberts, I just wish you could understand. Billy and I really love each other. (hammer pounding) (Cheryl sobbing) I still think of Billy as my little baby. Everything moved so fast. Yesterday's become tomorrow's before you even blink. I do understand. I had a boyfriend once. I do understand, Honey! C'mere. Oh, Honey. (sobbing) (eerie music) I have another round sitting in the refrigerator. Honey, could you get it for me? Sure. Oh, you're so caring. Thank you. (sobbing) (sinister music) (body thumping on floor) (eerie music) (birds chirping) (footsteps clicking) Hello, hello! It's me, Margie! (eerie music) Hello? Cheryl? (eerie music) (Cheryl whispering to self) Hi, Margie. Oh, hi! (laughing) What? Your hair! What did you do? You like? Yeah. I did it myself. I think it makes me look younger. Oh, definitely, yes. Oh yeah, I love it. It's different. Thanks. (chuckling) Hi, Margie. Hi, Cheryl. Hi, Billy. Billy! I thought you were upstairs! Where have you've been? Didn't you get my note? No. Well, I had to go to Julie's house to give her books. Her mother said she was coming over here. Well, did she come? Well, didn't she? No, she came by, she had to leave. She said she'd call you later. Here you go. Doctor says he's gotta have lots of milk. Cheryl, what'd you do to your hair? Don't you just love it? Why, it's the latest thing. (chuckling) I brought you some of my homemade cheesecake. And look, some new sports magazines. Basketball. Oh sit down, Billy, we'll all have some. You know, some one was out of work at Frank's office for three weeks! Isn't this fun? It's like having a party. And then my sick boy is going straight upstairs to bed. You really should take care of yourself, Billy. Maybe I should've brought my chicken soup instead. The doctor said the only way to get rid of it is plenty of sleep. (thumping on floor) Billy! Billy! (thunder rumbling) (crickets chirping) (Billy moaning) Oh, he's coming out of it. (Billy moaning) Hi, Honey. Don't talk. I still say you should call a doctor. Margie, you have said that 10 times now, he'll be fine, thank you. Why don't you go home? I don't need you any more. (thunder rumbling) I see. Well, obviously you know what you're doing. I just wanted to be of some help. But if don't want me- I don't! All right. (crickets chirping) She seems to think I need help taking care of you. Oh, the reason that I brought you into this room, is that I didn't want her to know about our little room. You, Ma- Save your strength, Honey; save your strength. Oh. The note. (crickets chirping) (eerie music) I'm your mother. (chuckling) Chuck. Chuck's your father. He was gonna leave me. Just like you were gonna leave me. He said he didn't love me. Wasn't going to marry me. So my sister and her husband adopted you. But then I wanted you back. So I had- (phone ringing) Be right back. (phone ringing) (thunder striking) (phone ringing) Hello? No. No, I haven't seen her all day. Mrs. Linden, if Julie was here, I would of seen her. To the airport? Why don't you take a cab? I don't really care. No, you cannot talk to him, he's very sick. Yeah, I'll tell her, if I see her. I thought you told Billy that Julie had been here. (thunder rumbling) Do you always listen on other people's phone conversations? I wasn't listening, I was- What are you doing here? I closed your windows. It looks like it's gonna rain. (clock ticking) You better go, Margie. (clock ticking) Do you mind if I use your phone to call Frank? I don't wanna get caught in the rain. There's an umbrella in the broom closet! You better use it. (thunder rumbling) Then go. (clock ticking) Would you hold, please? Just one second. Julie Linden's mother. I don't wanna talk to her. I already told her you were here. Thanks. Hello, Miss Linden? Look, I'm sorry about... What time was she supposed to pick you up? (thunder rumbling) I see. I think Miss Roberts is kind of peculiar myself. Well maybe I should just stop by and take a look. Bye-bye. What's wrong? Is Westcott working the Injun Road area? Yes. I'm going out there. Tell him to stop by the Robert's place, and tell Carlson where I am. (thunder rumbling) (crickets chirping) (eerie music) (Cheryl singing) Little boy Billy all dressed in blue I love you Yes I do Little boy Billy with eyes so brown Come to me, come lie down I found the umbrella. I'm leaving now. (door slams shut) Little boy, Billy. You will drink it! Drink it! I spoke to Chuck about you. It's all your fault. He agrees! (eerie music) (thunder rumbling) Drink the rest of this. What a little messy baby. (smack) (eerie music) I'll be back. (eerie music) It's time to go to bed. I'll be downstairs.

I put him down there where he belongs. He's with me forever. But a rotten sister. She tried to take you away from me. I took care of her, too. Don't ever make me do that to you. You promise? I promise. You promise? You little lying shit! (slapping) You're a lying bastard! You're lying! (screaming) You lying bastard! You lying bastard!

Yeah, he's dead. (police scanner blaring) Captain, I'm going in there. (gun trigger clicking) (thunder rumbling) Don't hold your breath, Billy. Don't, just keep breathing. You keep breathing. There's nothing pumping down there, there's nothing. Ow! Get your hand away from it. You'll be all right. (footsteps tapping) (quiet music) Get away from there! Back up. Well, you really did it, Billy. Hey, Lieutenant! Oh, God! (eerie music) Julie! Which of you two assholes killed Cook? No! It was her. She killed him. Look in the basement. Get on the radio and get her some medical attention. Right away! Shouldn't I check the basement? She saw Miss Roberts kill Cook. Carlson, the girl said- I don't care what she says! Get home! No! No!
