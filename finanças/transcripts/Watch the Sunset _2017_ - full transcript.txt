It's just when I get off of it I hate it. Every day it's about you know, if I don't get the money, I'm just gonna be like this. People, including the ex-chief commissioner Christine Nixon, says let's give us back the heroin days anytime over the current problem of ice. It's almost the reverse but with the same outcome, that is they were in poverty, gangs, drug cartels, and full prisons. And the deaths that were happening from drug overdoses with heroin, the deaths that they have from murders and violence from ice users. A 13-year-old boy started on it, and then he and a group of guys break into a house and the women was there and was pregnant, and they slashed her up. He's in and out of jail, and he's only just 15, since he was 13, and he's a lovely kid. But that substance makes him into a monster. Every day, six, seven times a day, the paramedics come straight up Swanson Street, up under Langley's, and I've never seen it before. Probably in the last six or seven months it's happened. Before that there was, you never saw it. I can see like people that are 14, 15 that are doing ice. I can see it in their eyes. These are the most out of control, most violent human beings I've seen in my life, and I've been around for a long time. In your entire career? Absolutely. And I wanna thank the police officers who have been giving us a very comprehensive briefing on the ice scourge. Come on. Come on, come on. Hey. Hey, I just need to talk to you. Don't touch me! Just need to talk to... Get the fuck away from me! Sally! Hey, can you lay that down come on... We're in the middle of a lesson. Well, I'm sorry. - Look... - Sorry. Do you mind?
