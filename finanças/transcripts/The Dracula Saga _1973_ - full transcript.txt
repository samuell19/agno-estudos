The old lineage of the Draculas was about to become extinct. The Draculas were already considered in those times... strange beings, to whom the locals attributed powers and habits that no one dared to mention. I inherited that feared name, and thanks to me the world still respects and fears vampires today. The old Count made that possible by bringing his granddaughter; who had been raised away from our family. She was a girl named Berta. - I fell asleep. - Yes, almost half an hour. I don't know how this racket didn't wake you earlier. It's terrible. I fall asleep all the time without realising. It's probably the pregnancy. When will you feel it? I suppose it will kick and move soon. Don't be silly. I can't feel that in the fourth month. - We'll stop here. - Here, in the middle of the woods? How can that be, Hans? Tell that man he can't do that. The horses don't want to go on. You won't be thinking about leaving us? We paid to get to Bistrita. We can't walk with the luggage. You'll do it. Sure, sure. Tell that to the horses. There's an inn not far from here. I'll help you there with the luggage. It's the devil. The devil is ringing the bell. My horses think it's the devil, fine. But you know it's the wind. And help me with this. Is there a place to sleep here? Sleep? I hired a trip to the hotel. My wife is in a state that requires the best care. Well, if you want to sleep in Bistrita, you'll have to walk there. My horses won't leave on a night like this. The forest is filled with lamiai. You're a Vlach. A stupid Vlach. Don't mind him, he's mad. But he'll make room for us here. Tomorrow morning, I'll take you to the hotel, with new horses. What are lamiai? And why the devil? Who else could make us hear the bell from the cemetery? How do you know if it's the bell from the cemetery? Or from a church? Or from a convent? Or from any other place in Bistrita? You Vlachs are all mad. Because of them, civilisation hasn't come. They're no better than the horses on my coach. You see, sir, they all want the unification of Magyars, but how can such different lineages become confused? Each with their legends. Romanians, Hungarians, Moldavians, Gypsies... Transylvania is a wasps' nest. Stop telling stories and take my horses to the stable. And bring us some wine. Strong wine. And the... what did you say? The lamiai? Who are the lamiai? They're very beautiful, madam, like you. But they're evil. The driver is right, Berta. Those are just ridiculous superstitions. Why don't we walk to the hotel? It's just a forest, anyway. Could you send us our luggage tomorrow? Whatever you want, sir. But the bell you hear ringing is from the cemetery of Vlad Tepes' castle. Vlad Tepes' cemetery is inhabited only by the dead, and it's ten miles from here. Tell me, then, who if not the devil can ring that bell and make us hear it so far away? It's a warning. Today, the forest is possessed by evil. They warned us. This is insane, Hans. Who cares if we reach Bistrita a little later? My grandfather isn't expecting us on a specific day. Please, Berta, control yourself. We come from a civilized country. We're not going to sleep among horses just because a superstitious peasant talks about devils and witches. - The lamiai are witches? - Something like that. Come on, Berta, let us walk. If we keep our pace, we'll soon be resting at the hotel. I feel as if someone grabbed me from the ground so I can't go on. There's no path here. Let's go back, Hans. These forests are filled with Russian hawthorns. They say their seeds came in the manes of Muscovite horses. I don't want to go on blindly. Your explanations are not enough. Come on, Berta. I'm with you. You have no reason to be afraid. Get out. Stop interfering. As if you had never seen a pretty girl lying down. Leave. Haven't you called the doctor? This girl is anaemic. She's lost a lot of blood. Didn't you see her wounds, Mother Petruscu? Don't call me mother. I should rather have died a virgin than have a son the likes of you. And what can you see with your only eye? I saw wounds on her neck and other parts that I don't mention so don't call me interfering. It must have been terrible to find her like this in the woods. Did some animal attack her? Everything is their fault. They provoke men with their shamelessness. Sin attracts violence. You never know what beasts lurk in the woods. She must have been attacked, and it seems she's still in shock. Who brought her here? Can you tell us how you found her? It seems as if she was attacked. Some sexual deviant, perhaps. We'll have to alert the authorities. My wife saw her first, but I'd prefer if you didn't question her right now. She's very upset and she's not feeling well. That experience in the woods must have been horrible. You should lay down. Let Mother Petruscu take care of you. Your grandmother was the best and noblest lady around here. Wasn't she? Not everybody in the castle was like her. After the grandmother died, they started to behave in a very different way. And that woman that came from so far away... Okay, okay. God has surely forgiven them. Nobody taught you to respect the law? - Who called me? - Those people. Sheriff, there you have it. Lust is laying on that table. Satan will take us all if we don't do penance for our sins and if we don't submit our flesh to abstinence. But... but this woman isn't dead. The living need the law too, Sheriff. This woman was attacked in a strange way. - I see. - And with terrible cruelty. I would say she was slowly drained of blood through her wounds. But here? In the hotel? No, no. It was in the woods. In the woods? It probably was an animal. And who are you? - I don't know him. - The gentleman is not from Bistrita. He's visiting. And I don't think an animal would choose so carefully the points for the wounds. If you already know what happened-- who attacked her and why-- file your report through the normal channels. But if you need my intervention, I'll be the one who says-- Have you read the sacred book of Revelation? Sin will lead us to confusion, and everything will be horror, blood, and fire. Watch him, Sheriff. He sells prayer books on the roads and is always looking at the girls. We'll have to exterminate the beast so there can be peace again among the Lord's children. There are many just as mad as he is capable of biting a woman. And you, sir? What do you think? I don't know. I don't know this region or your customs, but I guess there must be an explanation. If someone takes responsibility for this girl, we'll have to give her a transfusion from some animal. And give her chopped liver. Raw. Are you asleep? This room is a little damp. I hope your famous castle is full of big fireplaces. Were you sleeping? What a strange story, that girl's. The doctor said those are very strange wounds, and that she lost a lot of blood. Were you afraid? Yes, a little. Well, I confess that I too was afraid. What is it? Where's the girl? Mother Petruscu, I fell asleep, and she wasn't here when I awoke. If the girl left, it was because she wanted to go. None of us knew her, what do we care? You're all brutes and irresponsible. That girl was in no condition to go wandering off. She was brought to my house, and my obligation was to take care of her. What do you think, Doctor? A patient that escapes from her doctor. She probably got soared because of the blood. Who knows, Mother Petruscu. Maybe she liked her illness. Well... if she left, it's her choice. Poor little dove. But we can't watch her all night if she wants to look for the eagle's talon herself. You see, sir? You bring her to us, and she doesn't seem to like it. You, girl. Take the gentleman to his room. if she didn't wake up, don't tell your wife. Her homecoming should be peaceful and sweet just as her childhood was in the castle. Don't worry. Are you going to Vlad Castle? Are you part of the same family? You truly belong to the same bloodline. Bring fresh bread. The lady wants fruit. Mr. Hans prefers an alcoholic beverage. Hurry up, Sergei. Where is Stilla? She's a princess. She must be sleeping. Did you sleep well? It's a beautiful day. You should get strong now, with milk, bread, and honey and some stimulant. I'll look for a plum liquor that I've had for many years. Miss Berta, I suppose. I was sure you were from the castle. I'm here to take you home, Miss. You and your husband. I'm Gabor. I'm the administrator. You wouldn't know me. I came to the castle after you left. How is grandfather? The Count is well. He wants to see you badly, as do Miss Irina and Miss Xenia. It's been a while since they've been with someone their own age. They didn't marry? Well, they still have time, they're very young. Mr. Gert and Mrs. Gastrop haven't forgotten you either. They're still alive? this gentleman is my grandfather's administrator. My husband. Gabor. He'll take us to the castle. I'll wait for you to finish your breakfast. We'll finish right away. We can leave now, right? Of course. Do you have the bill ready? We're leaving now. Take me to the coach. I want to see it. Does it have our county's coat of arms? I hope she's always as happy as when she was little. Here. I'm sure our luggage will get here today. Let that go toward our transportation to the castle. To the castle? Forget it, sir. The mountain is very steep, and that area doesn't have a good reputation around here. Your butler can come and get the luggage. Are you going to let that girl sleep all morning? Get up now, you lazy good-for-nothing. It's time to get up. All this will belong to the next Count. We'll go first to the cemetery. I want to see Grandmother's grave. It's the first one to the left. "Felicia Castelnuovo de Tepes." "In memoriam. She wished and knew how to be silent." "Ivor Vlad de Tepes. Count Dracula." That's grandfather. Gabor, what does this mean? Don't worry, Miss. Let's hurry. Your family is waiting for you. Don't mind that. Your grandfather is anxious to see you. Well, we're finally here. Isn't grandfather home? Follow me. Where's Grandfather? And my cousins? I was told to take you to your quarters. But I want to see them. Come, Berta. You'll see them later, Miss. Will you tell my grandfather that we're here? Don't worry, you'll see him soon. It's not bad. Listen. - What? - Be quiet. I don't hear anything. I don't know. I thought I heard someone crying. Crying? - Yes, Crying. Come here. Do you like it? And our luggage, Hans? What are we supposed to do? Hans, what do we do? Gabor will go and collect it. What are you worried about? It's just that... I don't like what's happening. But, Berta, what's happening? I don't know. I was expecting a different welcome. Maybe they're preparing a surprise for you. It's true that Gabor is a little strange, but he's very nice and thoughtful. You'll see, your family will show up anytime. They're probably out. Or perhaps they're still in bed. We should ask Gabor for a mirror. I'm going to look for him. We need our luggage, and they must bring us a mirror. I don't understand why Gert isn't here. - Who? - The old servant. I'll get somebody. Are you there, Mrs. Gastrop? What are you doing here? Why did you come up here? Where is Mrs. Gastrop? And Gert? And our luggage, who's going to get it? I was about to leave. You don't have to worry. I'll take care of you. Lunch is served, and your husband is waiting for you. Look. Now, this is a nice surprise. I'm starving. So, it's just the two of us for lunch? Apparently. There's nobody in the kitchen. The whole house seems empty. And we won't see them either at dinnertime? The rooms are locked. There are no servants. So, let's begin. The food looks excellent, doesn't it? Did you see this beef? And this wine? It's undrinkable, horrible. It's awful. It doesn't smell. But it tastes terrible. Give me some water. I found the mirror, you know. I was going to tell you when Gabor called me for lunch. It wasn't broken. They had just taken it down. Do you want beef? No, I don't want any. Aren't you going to eat? No, the beef is too rare. I'll have fruit. I don't like it. It must be the pregnancy. What? I don't know. Are you well? Yes, I see you eating and behaving as if nothing happened. You don't seem concerned. Why should I be concerned? Those graves from the cemetery. The cemetery? What's with them? Are you talking about that bell? I'm talking about the headstones for grandfather and my cousins, as if they were buried there. He wrote to you, didn't he? And that man, the administrator. He talked about them as if-- I mean... He didn't say they were dead. That's what's disturbing, don't you understand? There must be an explanation. It's very strange, of course. It's inexplicable. Some gloomy detail. They probably have their graves ready for when their time comes. In a way, it's practical. Although... truly unpleasant. Do you want to go outside? We could take a walk. You'll see, they'll show up soon. Maybe it isn't locked. Gabor left afterwards. He could have left it unlocked. Wake up. You slept a long time. Let's go, Hans. Let's leave straight away. Don't talk nonsense. Come on, they're waiting for us. Get up. Come on. You should get ready. We have to go down for dinner. Everybody is waiting for you. Everybody? Yes, in the dining room. My dear Berta. The girl that left. You've never met Munia. She is my wife. Munia, this is my granddaughter. She's even more beautiful than you had said. Your hands are freezing. Let us sit. Don't overwhelm her. Berta, this is your place. Hans, you sit here. Berta, you have to tell us everything you have done. - How is London? - And how is your house? Is it like the castle? No. It's a bit smaller. Is it true that you're going to have a baby? - Yes. - In five months. There will be time to talk. Leave us, Mrs. Gastrop. Can you feel it already? No, not yet. I wonder how it is now? When will it start to move? Come, now, leave your cousin alone. What's it like to have a living human being inside? The child doesn't do anything yet. He grows inside the mother... and feeds on her blood. Gert, please. You haven't sewed wine to the lady. No, thank you. I'll just have water. Is it because of your state? I don't think it will disagree with you. - No, not at all. - No, it's not that. You never drink? We have to celebrate your arrival. Come, Berta. Just for tonight. I'd like to toast to our reunion. And especially to you, our kind hostess. I think the toasts should be made at the end. Let's toast to the heir. The future Count Dracula. And to his mother, without whom he'll never exist. Well. And you'd leave me out? He's as important as Berta. We'll toast to him. This is an extraordinary wine. You like it? Well, you'll only have it in this county. We have a good reserve. The cellar is full. Berta, you still haven't tried it. Drink. Let's see what you think. Gert, you may serve the beef. No, please. I'll go with her. Excuse her. It must be the pregnancy. She barely ate this morning. And she felt sick just by seeing the meat. We have to take care of her. I left her in her room. She insisted on lying down, but she didn't seem sick. Let her drink whatever she wants. You were delightful. The heir to the title is inside of her. It doesn't surprise me that you were frightened. Those graves you saw... and then us. All of us. What do you mean? Who told you? In fact, our family's destiny is moving towards those graves. We suffer from a unique illness, and doctors can't agree about it. But they all agree that we're fatally dominated... by fear. By sadness. Did you notice the lack of colour in our faces, Berta? Our skin is like an old parchment... without that contrast that gives vigour to human faces. We Draculas are pale, melancholic, misanthropic. And that loneliness... is reflected in the colour of our faces. Vlad Dracula, Voivode and Lord of Walachia. The most feared of the leaders in Transylvania. He was called "The lmpaler" because he used to impale his enemies. There are more than 100,000 deaths attributed to his reign. But the family's book only talks about our reign in this life. It doesn't mention our activities... in the next. Your son, Berta... your son will be the heir of the county of Dracula. Our existence is exhausting. Dangerous. And that future grandson... comes to replace his tired ancestors in the eternal melancholy that we suffer. Gabor. Is this the luggage? Berta's luggage. I want to see it. No, I have to take it to the Countess' bedroom. - We'll help you, but... - We want to see it. We want to see it first. She asked me to bring it. - Gabor, wait. - Come, ladies. - Be reasonable. - Gabor, please. - Stop it. - I opened it. Gabor, don't be foolish. Miss Irina, your flattery won't work. Don't do it. What are you doing? Look. - We won't do anything bad. - Stop it. - Look at this dress. - This one. Come here right now. That's not yours. Leave Miss Berta's clothes alone or I'll tell the Madam. This is outrageous. Everything disorderly. It wasn't like that. Of course not. Look at your handiwork. - It has to be folded. - We know how to do it. Don't move, or I'll call the Count. "I saw a woman sit upon a beast, "full of names of blasphemy, "having seven heads and ten horns. "And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, "and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, "having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations. "And upon her forehead was a name written... Mystery." "And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the martyrs." Who's there? I could guess who it is, since you hide that way. I'm not afraid of you, even if you have a word engraved on your forehead, and even if you have more than one head. You're two. And from the look of you, I surmise nothing good brought you here. No, sir. My sister Irina and I were lost in the woods and we were hiding, afraid because we didn't know you. But from your prayers, we saw that you're a good man. So you are sisters? And I suppose you do your pranks half and half. The point is, my sister hurt her foot and we can't get home. I can barely walk. How can I feel sympathy for you, you who so often are a cause of sin and perdition for man? How could I move to mercy? The sight of lust itself. - What damnation. - But, sir... You attack the man and provoke his fall... with...with your deceptive... We beg you. With your deceitful charms. Could you accompany us? I beg you. If you're truly in distress... Would you be so kind? Who's there? Is that you? Who is it? Whoever you are, can you hear me? I just want to know what happened to my husband. Where is he? Help me, please. What's wrong? I can't find my husband. And the castle is empty. There's no one. Like the first day. The first day? Hans has disappeared. And there was blood in the forest. And this shawl. My luggage- Do you know anything about this? She was found in the forest completely drained of blood. Yes. I saw some Gypsies--- Lower your voice. You said you saw some Gypsies? Yes. They hid when they saw me. Doctor, did something happen to my husband? And may the eternal light guide you. - What's wrong? - She saw something in the forest. Bring a glass of liquor for the lady. What is it? Do you have a clue about this death? There are some vagrants. A man and a woman. I saw them. People don't do things like that. Didn't you see the bites? This was done by beasts. The shawl. Two years ago, wolves came into town and killed two children. It's not wolves. Damned Gypsies. We need to cast them out of the region. Who told you it was the Gypsies? Why would they drink her blood? Someone is guilty, and we have to take action. Tell us everything you know, madam. What's wrong, my girl? The shawl. - It was...it was-- - Why did you flee the castle? We have to capture those Gypsies immediately. First, we should investigate if they caused these atrocities. I wonder if something happened to Hans. Where are you taking me? I came to warn you. They'll be here soon. They'll ask questions. Exactly. And the quieter they find the castle, the better for everybody. You'll spend the night with the only member of the family you haven't met yet. You have a visitor tonight, sir. I hope you like it. Miss Berta, we were worried. Where were you? The shawl. But I myself put it in your luggage this morning, cleaned and ironed. How is this possible? Ask him about Hans. Have him tell you where he is. Dear. What happened to you? You had us worried. Thank you, Doctor, for bringing her. What has happened? Your wife is very nervous. There were some unusual activities in town. She was afraid for you, and she couldn't come back by herself. For me? Come on, my love. We were all worried about your whereabouts. Did you bring her in your coach? No. A peasant brought us. I'll take you back to town, Doctor. Will you come with me, Miss? Your grandfather and the ladies are waiting for you. You go with Gabor. I'll thank the doctor for his kindness. We have to leave. Don't you see what's happening in this house? Leave me. Get out. You've done it again, Valerio, blast you. Gabor, take her away. Excuse me. Now you see? Could that thing ever inherit the title of the Draculas? Only your son will be able to save the continuity... of our lonely species. He was born that way-- repulsive and ridiculous. And that monstrosity that you saw, that monster would have to be my heir. Valerio is the result of the excesses and degeneration of my ancestors. But Berta's son will be strong, healthy, powerful-- like the first Vlad, who put all Walachia at his feet. There. That's it. My little girl is going to rest. You must rest and take care of yourself. In your state-- Why did you let so many months go by without calling me to examine her? Especially if she's as bad as you say. Well, her illness doesn't seem to be in her body. It's more in her mind. Her illness is in her head. Her weakness is caused by a loss of blood, of course. It's very strange. I examined her thoroughly, and there isn't a sign of a single wound in her body. You mean she hasn't lost blood? It obviously isn't a case like the ones we had a few months ago. There aren't any marks on her body. Nobody has attacked her. Attacked her? My granddaughter hasn't left the castle since that night. You brought her yourself. I'm sorry, but since the strange deaths of some people and the disappearance of others, they fear the most horrible mysteries in Bistrita. I had to stop a crowd that pretended to search the forest to capture two Gypsies that your granddaughter saw. Superstitions? But sometimes, you know, their vulgar obsessions-- what they usually call a legend or popular fantasy-- has its hidden truth. Sometimes. I think in this country we're closer to the mystery of death. I knew that the moment I came to this forest. Here, superstition can come alive. You're not Transylvanian, Doctor? No, I am German. Then you won't stop until you've solved the mystery. His Lordship the Count has called me? Prepare the coach to take the doctor. I'm sorry, Your Excellency. I wish I had been more helpful. You helped us more than you think. One last question, Doctor. Berta's current state... won't harm her pregnancy? I've seen no indication of that. On the contrary, it's strange how nature manages. Right now, the child is the stronger one. Careful. These aren't labour pains. It's still too soon for that. Don't you see? Someone is biting her from inside. Someone that lives. My grandson. Pick that up and throw it outside. Take Berta to her room. We must remove another body. Take them wherever you want. Take that garbage out of the castle. Valerio killed that Gypsy, sir. He's awaiting your punishment. Leave Valerio to me. Berta's son is alive. Therefore, Valerio's existence doesn't mean anything anymore. Berta, what are you doing up? Come on, Berta. You mustn't tire yourself. There's little time left. It'll be over in a few days. I think she's almost ready. - Because of the size. - And the dates. It could happen any moment now, and... let us hope it's at night. He's dead. And the boy? Where's your son? Where is he? He's dead. And I came back to life. I had a long existence ahead of me. I would continue to feed on blood, and my life would be an eternal loneliness. But the Dracula bloodline had been saved.
