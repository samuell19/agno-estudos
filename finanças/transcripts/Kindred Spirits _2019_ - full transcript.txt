I'm flying! Come on, Aunt Sadie! Catch me! Catch me, Aunt Sadie! Nicole! I owe you my life, Aunt... Sadie. Hey. What's out there? Mm. Your workout routine's gonna kill me. Huh. You are my workout routine. You're not leavin' already, are you? I do not wanna be here when your daughter gets home from school. - Hey, Chloe. - Hello, Derek. Is my daughter upstairs? Goddammit, Nicole. So, did you use protection? I mean, if you can't even talk about it, maybe you're not ready for sex. Hey... I'm not making any judgments. I just don't wanna see you make the same mistakes that I did when... You can't wait until after dinner to remind me I was a mistake? That is not what I said! Yeah, that's not the best choice of words. - I don't think. - No kidding. Well, I mean, you can't give her ammunition like that. Well, Alex, she turns everything I say into ammunition. I bet she's in there right now trash-talking me to Shay. Trash-texting. Yeah, Shay's the same way with her mom. She just pushes me away. You know, I think you could be talkin' about us. I mean, you push me away. Don't you think this is nice, you know, the two of us in bed? Talking about how our day went. We should try it in person sometime. I should probably go check on her. Hey, Chloe... I like you. Okay? And more than w-whatever this is. Goodnight, Alex. Hello? Oh, shit. Nicole? Can we talk? I miss her, too. With those red streaks and the jacket. Like, where did she get that... I think my mom is straight up ignoring me now. I wish my mom would ignore me. And the boots. Stella, Charlotte and I have a question for you. Damn, Nicole, what'd she do? Why? Hello? Yes, this is Chloe. Thank you. Aunt Sadie! Nicky! - Hi! - Hi! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! - Oh! What are you doing here? - Oh, my God. I had to come see my favorite little niece. - I'm your only niece. - Ooh, that's right. - Ooh. - Ooh. Oh, you're so gorgeous. - Don't you know? - Sadie. Hi, Chloe. Come on, don't be sad. I should be incredibly mad at you. One whole year and nothing? Uh, yeah, but I'm sorry. - Mm... - Ping, ping, ping, ping. - Well, I'm not even mad. - Yeah, don't be. Hi! Hi! - Look. - Wow! Ha-ha-ha! - Oh, my God! - Heh-heh. So what do you think? Does the house feel smaller? No, it's the same. I mean, it feels kind of big. - Oh, wait, here. - No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. - I've got it. - Okay. Um... Are you in my old room still? - Yeah, best room in the house. - Okay. Well, will you put my stuff in there, then? - Yes, master. - We have a spare room. - Don't you want your own space? - No! I wanna be with Nicky. Oh, yay! I am home. Oh, it's been a long time since I've been able to say that. I really love your hair, by the way. - Really? - Yeah. You haven't grown it out since you were little. I'm glad you like it. Where were you? I think the last I heard was, um... New Orleans? Yeah. Doesn't really matter. It matters to me. How long are you here for? I don't know. How long will you have me? Well, for as long as you'd like. I mean, it's still your home, too. - Move in! Move in! - Okay. I mean, I don't have anywhere I've got to go. So I guess we could just take it, like, one day at a time, if that works for you. You'd probably be sick of me by tomorrow. - No way. - Really? 'Cause I'll keep doin' this. I would love it. Well, why did you leave us? I, um... Well, you know, your mom had been basically looking after me since she was 15. - No, that's, that's not... - No, it is true. Totally true. 'Cause after my mom and our dad died, Aunt Betty moved in. And she just... She sucked. She just, like, drank G and Ts and watched Bold And The Beautiful all day, every day. So your mom was basically all I had. And then she had you when she was a baby. That was, that was great and fine and... - So it was my fault you left. - No! It wasn't... It's not. Not... That's not true. Um, that's not what I meant. I just like... It was just... I had more energy than this town could handle. So what did this girl do, the one that you hit? - Bitch was about to talk shit. - Hey... Wait, she was about to talk shit. So she hadn't? Oh, so you're just nippin' it in the bud, are you? - Mm-hmm. - Be careful. - This one's impulsive. - Oh-oh. Like me. I always said Nicky and I are kindred spirits. I know I should have outgrown this thing by now, but I just... I just love it. I think we'd all be better off if we never outgrew the things we loved as kids. It's so funny that you still have that. I'd be roadkill if it wasn't for you. I owe you my life, Aunt Sadie. Mm, you owe your life to your mom. Mm, yeah. She reminds me of it every day. Your mom is the strongest person I know. You'd be surprised what can happen if you just open up to her. - She doesn't give me a chance. - What do you mean? - I sort of have a boyfriend now. - Whoo-hoo! Nicky... Wait, what's his name? - His name is Derek. - Derek. Derek and Nicole. Nicole and Derek. I love it. What else? He is cute and... I don't know, he likes video games. He sounds perfect. So... He's better than that. I don't know. The other day... mom walked in on us and our shirts were off. Nicky! - Are you sleeping with him? - No! No, no, no. No, no, no. We were just messing around. But, see, at least you ask, instead of just assuming. Have you slept with anyone? No! That's a good thing. Teenage boys have a lot to learn. It's really nice to be able to talk to you about this stuff. With my mom, it's just so weird. "Nicole, are you using protection?" Yeah, well, imagine if you had a baby right now. Yeah. No, thank you. She had to raise you all on her own. She's had to do everything on her own. So, I don't know. I guess it seems like she's kinda hard on you, but you can always talk to her. Always. Mm, whoo. I like that haircut of you, though. It looks great. You're not mad at me for copying you? I mean, you didn't really copy me. Uh, yes, I did. Ugh! - You look pretty. - That is... - Yeah. - Mom says I kinda look like you. Yeah, sure! I owe you my life, Aunt Sadie. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Hey, Sadie. - Mm? - Can-can we talk for a minute? - Yeah. - Is everything okay? - What do you mean? Oh, well, I mean, you showed up out of the blue... which, don't get me wrong, I'm grateful for. I'm thrilled to see you. But if it's because... you need help with something or somebody or anything... you need to tell me. - Sadie. - Yeah. No, sorry, I'm just, uh... I, um... I wanted to come home 'cause like... I've kind of... you know, made a mess of a lot of things and... I've, like, failed in literally everything I've tried to do, so, I, uh... I don't have many options. I just thought that I should, you know, come home and... um, maybe start over? It's, which is probably stupid. No. It doesn't sound stupid to me at all. Hey, look, I-I don't, I don't know what you've been going through, but... I know that you're still young and, I think, maybe you're being too hard on yourself. And I think it makes perfect sense to take a moment, regroup, rebuild. And in the meantime, you're home. Right? Mm-hmm. Come here. No more sad face. Give me a hug. What's going on in here? Nothing. I was just getting ready for work. Mm-hmm. Oh, and, Sadie, I'm not exactly thrilled with the idea of Nicole having too much fun as she's suspended. Oh, okay. Should we make her scrub the floors, then? You know, that might teach her a lesson. But I know she hasn't seen her Aunt Sadie in a long time, so... And that girl was gonna talk shit. - That is true. - All right. Let's not go there now, but I suppose I can postpone the punishment for now. - Thank you! - Aw... - All right, have fun. - Yup. Still be good, but don't have too much fun. Nope. Never when you're not here. Eh, so what should we do first as good girls? We do, uh... garage? - Okay, you weirdo. - Okay. - Okay. - Yeah? Oh, my... Hey, did... - I smashed this to pieces! - I know. One of your famous temper tantrums. Mom told me all about it. I get them, too. It took me forever to put it back together. - Look. - Yeah, it's the Edwards family. I made these guys. I used to play with them all the time. - Wait, you did? - Yeah. I also, uh, have that book that you wrote about them. - You're such a good writer. - Mm-hmm. Shay and I added a few of our own, but they probably suck. We used to get dressed up and pretend we were the Edward sisters. So nobody understood... Nobody understood. Are you... mad? No. Kinda seems like you're mad. No, I'm really not. It's just a lot of nostalgia. Haven't looked at this stuff in ages. Hey, are nana's old theater costumes down here still? Mm-hmm. Come and get me! Good day! My lady. Kill her... Sadie? What's wrong? Come on, we should go. We don't wanna get caught playin' hooky. Mom won't like that. Bet you can't catch me! Ha-ha! - Yes, I can! - Bet you can't! Ah! Ooh! - How did you do that? - I'm very, very, well, smart. - Thanks. See you. - Okay. See you. - Well, hello, Shay. - Hey, Chloe. Did my dear darling daughter ask you over? - Yeah. - Is that okay? - Hello, Alex. How are you? - Hello, Chloe. It's nice to see you again. Did Shay here tell you that Nicole was suspended yesterday? Uh, no. She didn't mention that. - Mm... - Come real quick. Sounds like you're not supposed to be here, sweetie. - Dad. - No, actually, it's okay. Sadie is back in town, and, uh, well, I might've postponed the punishment. So go ahead. You're good. - Sadie, huh? - Yeah. - Blast from the past. - You're telling me. Shay mentioned that there might be a party tonight. I was thinkin' if the kids went, we could, um, get together. Well, if they go, I'll probably just be hangin' out with my sister. - Okay. - But I'll catch you next time. Okay. Hey, what are you guys doing? Hey, Sadie, what should Shay be? - Hey. - I can't believe you're here. Mm-hmm. Hey, look at you. You're all grown up. How's your family? - Remember my brother, Rory? - Mm-hmm. He's pre-med at Columbia. - Oh, wow! - Go, Rory. - Pretty, yeah. - Nice. - What about your parents? - Oh, uh... They're separated. Her mom kinda bailed. Oh, no. I'm so sorry. - They'll get back together. - Mm. They're a total mess without each other. Yeah, I'm-I'm sure that's what's gonna happen. But Nicole's right, we have to get you changed. - You look ridiculous. - Yeah, what is this? Hey, mom. There's a party at Kenny Killian's tonight. Can we go? I feel like this, absolutely, should be out of the question. Oh, please, oh, fair noble queen! You may taketh my head on the morrow, but tonight let me partake in the revelry. Oh, come on, please! I don't know, I feel like Sadie doesn't wanna go to a high-school party. No, I don't mind chaperoning these butt-heads. But we go under one condition. We go in costume. Yeah? - That's hilarious. - I don't know. Come on! Get you changed, anyway. Looks like you two had fun. Yeah, we did. Nicole feels like a little sister to me. So... does she confide in you? - Don't... - Do what? Don't turn me into an informant, Chloe. I'm not. I would just say... don't assume things 'cause... she's a good girl. Okay? You look pretty. I feel like we shouldn't have brought you here, you know? Yeah, you should have. I don't know what we were thinking. - I can't go in like this. - Yes, you can. You can do literally whatever you want in high school as long as you have one thing, confidence. Shay! Shay! Shay! Shay! - Shay! Shay! Shay! Shay! - Oh! Oh, my God! Crazy. - Come on in. - Let's go out. Get a bite to eat. It'll be like a proper date. Mm, my feet hurt. Come on, let's just order in and that way we can fuck while we wait. - Don't do that. - Do what? Try to distract me from the fact that you don't wanna be seen with me. - Ever. - Aw... - Look, it's just... - Come on in. Okay? And you're cute when you pout. Good one! - Nicole? - Derek! - What are you doin' here? - What am I doing here? - This is my Aunt Sadie. - Oh! - I-I heard a lot about you. - Oh, yeah? What have you heard? Um, I heard you saved my girlfriend's life when she was little. Did he just say the G word? Well, you take care of this one. She's literally the best. I got my eye on you. Cheers to that, I guess. - Will you be a doll? - Yeah. Nicky, he's hot! I'm just happy she's back. And it could be good for Nicole, too. And when are we gonna tell her and Shay about us? Well, w-what is it that we should be telling exactly? The truth, that we like spending time together and-and maybe that'll become something in the future or maybe it won't, but right now something is happening. Mm... not yet. Give Nicole some credit. She can take it. Sometimes I think that you're trying to keep her a kid. I'm not trying to prevent her from growing up. I'm doing the exact opposite. Okay. Look, they're gonna be adults in a hot minute, which means we'll have plenty of time to figure out what to do with ourselves. Okay. Whoo-hoo! - I thought you would want this. - Huh? I-I thought you would want this. Oh, yeah! You're totally right. Cheers. - I'm Sadie. Who are you? - Kenny. Oh, you're Kenny! This is your party! - Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. - Oh, cool! I like your mask. It's cool that you guys, you know, do your own thing. Yeah, I mean, we like to play. Where do you go to school? A-are you a senior? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah. Um... I'm homeschooled. But... it's my last year before college. - Yeah. - Where do you wanna go? - Columbia. Pre-med. - Oh. Wow! Beauty and brains. - Where have you been hiding, S... - Kenny! Nah, it's okay. I have been in hiding. But now that you've found me... what are you gonna do about it? Want to see my room? - Yeah. - Okay. - Wow! - Oh, yeah! What's her deal? Like, how do you mean? I mean, can you imagine ever wanting to go to a high-school party again? Because I can't. You know, she said she wanted to start over. That's one way to go about it. She's always been a little... immature. How old is she? She's 25. - Do you wanna sit down? - Oh, yeah, sure. Take off your mask. How come? I think I really like you, Kenny. Kenny. - What? - I have to go. Why is that? My mom is really strict. - Well, that sucks. - No, it doesn't. It means she really cares about me. She's giving me a test tomorrow. - Because I'm homeschooled. - Oh, yeah, right. - Remember? - Right. Bye. How do I look? - You look amazing! - Really? Yeah! Oh, my God! - Did you do a streak? - Yeah, I did. But don't worry. This is, like, not my actual hair. I didn't cut it again. - This is one of nana's wigs. - Okay. I was, like, chopping it up all last night while you snored. - I don't snore. - You... Yes, you do! - I snore? - Yeah. It's cute, though. It looks good. - Twins! - Twin... Hey, did you know that last night, like, half the party thought that you were our age? - Really? - Yeah! That's stupid. My Aunt Sadie's still got it. Oh, you're boney! Well, that's why I have my healthy breakfast. - Hi. - Hi! Ah, the horses. Oh, well... Okay. Wait, there's two of it! Oh, perfect! Oh, yeah. It's beautiful. - These shoes. - Oh, yeah. 'Cause I... Uh, hello? - Hey. - Oh... - That'd be 22.36. - Okay. - Thank you, Sadie. - Of course. Wish me and my sister got along as well as you two. Yeah, we're very lucky. Nicole. Whoa. Sadie. Oh... Hey! I never realized how much you guys look like each other. - Mm-hmm. - Ah. How was school today? It was a nightmare, I seriously almost slapped Serena to get suspended. Ha! That's amazing. Come on, let's go. So did you skip out of school early? Uh-uh. Wednesday's a half day. Hey, we still going to the movie? Yeah. We could just go over there now. Play some pinball while we wait. Oh, does The Old Mill still have pinball machines? - That's right. - What? You're pretty good at it, aren't you? I'm really good at it. But, uh, I don't think I'm gonna come with you. - Because I don't feel great. - What's wrong? Nothin', I'm just kinda like headache-y and, you know, nauseous. - We could go home. - No, you guys go to the movies. I'll go home for a bit and then, like, I'll pick you up after? Yeah, okay, if that's okay with you. Yeah, it's totally fine. Just text me. - Okay. - Okay. - We'll miss you. - Love you. Bye. - Feel better. - I will. Why is she trying to look like you? Don't you think that's weird? No. I think it's cool. Come on. Come on. Ah. Nicole! Hey! What are you doing? Nicole! Hello? Hey. Sadie, I'm sorry. I, I thought you were Nicole. Um... - I've never done this before. - Uh... But I want to, with you. You won't tell anyone, right? At school? I-I just don't wanna get a reputation. It would break my mother's heart. N-no. I... - I-I won't tell anyone. - Okay. Is this your first time? Derek? Shh... Anyone home? Nicole? Nicole? Honey, what's wrong? Nicole wanted to give me a haircut so we'd be twins. So you wanna, you wanna tell me what's wrong? I'm gonna be 26 next week! It's not funny! Hey. Hey, hey, hey. We can celebrate yours and Nicole's birthday together. The same time, like we used to. No, Nicole wants her own party. Uh, no. She adores you. I can't remember the last time it was just you and me. I love you. I love you, too! Always. - Bad TV? - Mm. - Yeah, bad TV. - Mm-hmm? - Chinese food from Twin Dragons? - I want Chinese food. All right, well, I'll go order. I'm old! Oh, my God. Those shoes are hideous. Look how different her nose is in this season... Wait... Right? Like, they say it's not scripted. But it's clearly... I thought you were gonna pick us up. Yeah, I thought you were gonna text me. Your phone is right there! I texted you multiple times. Did you really? Oh, shit! Nicole, I'm sorry! I didn't see! I'm so stupid! - How did you get home? - Shay's dad picked us up. But we had to wait for him to get off of work. - Is Alex here? - No. He went home with Shay. Why do you even care? Oh, Nicky, you're mad. I'm sorry. Whatever. Are you hungry? We have Chinese. - Where is it from? - Twin Dragons. Ugh! That place is fucking gross. Hey. Look, I'm sorry there was a mix-up, but that's no excuse for this attitude. I think we should rewind now 'cause now she's crying, so we miss... Yeah, but she's, like, always crying. - All right! - Fine, fine. She always cries! I wonder why she's crying this time. I'm sorry. - Are we still friends? - Of course. - I feel like a flake. - No, it's fine, I'm... Honestly, I feel stupid. I feel like I overreacted. Mm-mm. No one likes to feel like they've been forgotten. I get it. It's just your mom was feeling lonely, so I thought I should spend time with her. Derek and Nicole. Nicole and Derek. Sadie and... Sadie and Derek... Derek? Yeah? I think I love you. Oh, my God! I can't believe I just said that out loud! I can't believe I just said that out loud! Ah... Hey, you don't have to say it back. When you do say, I-I want it to be spontaneous. That's the only way that I'll know it's real. Okay? - Okay? Okay? Okay? - Okay. Well, now I know exactly what I'm gonna wish for my birthday. What did y'all wish for? Oh, we'll never tell. - I'm here for you. - Not for me. Thank you. Let's cut some cake. Birthday girls... Okay, now... Thanks. Do you want me to load the dishwasher? - You're the birthday girl. - No. Nicole's the birthday girl. - Mine's the day after tomorrow. - Okay. It's funny that your dad's here, huh? Chloe said I should invite him. He never passes up cake. Oh. Wow. You know, Shay, I think... I think you're very... - What? - Ah, it's not my place to say. Sadie, what are you talking about? I just think you're being very immature about all this, you know? No, I don't know. Oh, are you se... Mm! I'm so sorry. Like, just... Forget I said anything. No, whatever's going on, you know you have to tell me now. - Right? - Hm. Yeah, I guess that's true. Um... Let's take out the trash. I better get going. Already? Yeah. Well, I-I'll come with you. That's not the only... I-I'm surprised you didn't know because, like, Nicole acted like you knew. - Knew what? - About Chloe and your dad. What about them? Well, you know, that they're... - Wait, are you serious? - Yeah. - For how long? - I don't know. - A while now. - How long has Nicole known? I think, like, a few weeks or something. - A few weeks? - I know. It's shitty. Come here. It's fine. What's wrong? Nothing. Come on. Nothing's wrong? No. Then why are you being such a dick to me on my birthday? I didn't expect a gift, but might've been nice. Or just like a gesture or maybe even just responding to my text. I'm sorry, I just... I got some stuff going on now and it's kind of a lot to deal with right now. All right. I'm sorry. What's wrong? I'm not really ready to talk about it yet. Okay. I understand. You know I'm here for you if you wanna talk about it. Happy birthday. Goodnight. - Hey, we got to go. - What's up? We got to go. - Now? - Yeah. Okay. Wait, what... Shay? What happened? It's okay, it's okay. Happy birthday, okay? "It's okay..." What's okay? I-I... I'll talk to you later, all right? Shay! You're not gonna look at me? Bye! Have a great night. Thanks for coming. Thanks. Oh, you smell nice. Why did Shay leave? I don't know. She didn't even say goodbye. This sucks. Do you wanna go bowling or see a movie? Bowling on my 18th birthday with my mom. That sounds like a lot of fun. Well, why don't you grab the last plate and we'll... I'm not fucking cleaning! It's my birthday! - Go to your room. - Go to my room? Are you fucking kidding me? Do I look like I'm kidding you? You're a dumb cunt. Get off of me! Hey! What is wrong with you? Oh, no! Please, don't cry. Aw... Hey, it's okay. You're doing your best, Chloe. You are. I see it. I see it all the time. You work really hard and... I mean, I honestly don't think anyone should be able to talk to you like that, especially not your own daughter. - I should go say something. - No, no, no, no, I just... I think that'd make things worse, don't you? Just, like, maybe let it settle. Let it cool off and then I can go talk to her. Yeah? Calm down. I'm glad you're here. - Here. - Thanks. Do you think I could have one? Uh... yeah. Okay! Mm-mm! Hey, I wanted to ask you, um, I was thinking about getting my GED 'cause I have these online classes and... Yeah. I think that's, that's great. - Yeah? You think so? - Absolutely. I just, I've always been such a slow learner. No, you haven't. You just never really a-applied yourself, but... I think this is a perfect first step. Do you think maybe, like, you could help me sometimes if it's hard? Absolutely. Yay! It'll be like homeschool! Yeah. I guess. Hey. You okay? Yeah? Is it okay if I sit here? I'm sorry that this all happened on your birthday. I know it's not what you planned, but... Try not to be too hard on your mom. I think this whole thing that Shay's dad is turning out to be way more serious than she thought. What? What do you mean? Well, just that she's really stressed out about it. - No, what thing with Shay's dad? - That they're seeing each other. - Mom and Alex? - Wait, you didn't know? Are you serious? She hasn't told you? Okay, well, I'm sure she's going to tell you, but... - Jesus! - Does Shay know? I don't know. That's why she's been ignoring my texts. Oh, Nicole, please, please, don't tell your mom that I told you. That bitch is the last person I wanna talk to right now. I'm flying! I want my mom. - Hey. - Hey. - Did Nicole leave? - Yeah, she must have. She wasn't here when I woke up. I wanted to talk to her before she left, but... Last night was... Yeah, but you didn't do anything wrong. Can you please just, I don' know, ask her to call me? Yeah, but I think I know what's up with her. - Really? - Uh-huh. - What is it? - We talked last night. And she and Shay think there's something going on with you and Alex. Which is silly, right? So you are seeing... You are seeing Alex? I didn't wanna tell anyone until I knew if it was gonna... be a, a thing or-or go somewhere. A-and is it, um, you know, going anywhere? Could be. I-I guess. I mean... When we first started out... it had been a while since, you know, I had sex with a person. And... I don't know, I don't know if it's just... me and my age or something which I kinda read about or, like, if he's super good at oral, which I think... Oh, my God! I can't hear this! I can't hear this! Stop! You're k-kidding, right? Yeah. Of course. Sorry, that was a bad joke. Why are you ignoring me? Look, I know that this whole thing is really awkward, but it's not like any of it was my fault. - You should've told me. - I just found out last night! - I don't believe you. - Why not? 'Cause you knew I'd freak out and then you wouldn't have the little family you always wanted. - What? Shay, that is so... - Okay. - That is so stupid! - What about my family? My mom and dad aren't even divorced. - They're just separated. - Stop! Okay, Nicole! Okay. - Shay, seriously! Shay! - Are you gonna hit me now? That's what you do when you don't get your way, right? - But I... Wait! - Just leave me alone! Just tell me! How did you find out last night? - Sadie. - What? "Mom, I just feel like" Nicole is around all the time. "And she always copies me." "I know, Sadie. I see it happening." "I wish there was a way I could help." "That's it, mom. That's what we should do." We should send Nicole away. "But, but how?" "I don't know. Maybe boarding school." "I heard you!" "Oh, Nicole!" "Nicole, now just calm down." "No!" "Mom!" "Sadie!" "Oh, thank God, you're okay. I don't know what I would do without you." "Oh, mom, now we're... Now, we're free. Now, it's just the two of us." Hey, Sadie. - Is, uh, is Chloe here? - No, you just missed her. Okay. I'll give her a call. Thanks. Wait, why don't you... Hey! Uh... Do you wanna come in for some coffee? - Nah, I... - No, come on. Come in. Come on. Thanks. You drove here? So she was really upset? Yeah. I mean, you know Nicole. She's strong. She pushed me all the way back. - I'm sorry. - Mm... Chloe says that she worries about her temper, and... I-I can see that. - Mm-hmm. - I think she's right. Yeah. I don't know. Maybe it's for the best. I don't think Shay has really dealt with the separation very well. I think she thinks that things are gonna work out with her mom and me, but, um... they're not, so... So what are you doing with Chloe? - Hm? - What are your intentions? I've known Chloe forever. I've always liked her and, um... I guess I don't know... when exactly I fell in love with her. I've never said that to her. I've never said that out loud. I think, um, if we could keep that as our little... our little secret, you know? - You know, Sadie? Right. - Mm-hmm. Yeah. - Okay. - Our little secret. Will you just wait one second? I'll be right back. You are seeing Alex? I want my mom. - I fell in love with her. - My pretty Sadie. You know, come home and then... um, maybe start over? I want my mom. Your mom is the strongest person I've seen... I can't remember the last time it was just you and me. I love you, baby girl. Your mom was basically all I had. You can always talk to her. Always. Would you mind giving me a hand? There's a box I need to get down in the garage. Thanks for the coffee. I should, uh... - I should probably go. - Yeah, no problem. Um, before you go, could you just help me, uh, in the garage? There's a box I need to get down before I leave. - Like, you're leaving leaving? - Uh-huh. Yeah, I mean, you know, I don't wanna get in the way of you and Chloe. You guys deserve to be happy. No, I'm... That's not what I meant. I'm sorry, that's not what I meant. I... You're not in the way of anything. Can you help me still? I mean, yeah. Yeah, of course. Oh, yeah, this is an old family thing. - You still play with it? - Mn-mn. It's just up there. That box. - Sadie's things. Right. - Uh-huh. Sadie... Sadie... Sa... Sa... Sa... Chloe... Please. No, you can't have her! Hello? Where's... Hey, shh! Hey! Hey! Okay! - Help me... - Okay. Okay. Uh... Oh! Ah! Oh, my God. Holy... Shh... Ugh... Oh... Ugh! Mm! - What are you doing? - Hey! Oh, you look different. I don't wanna look like you anymore, Sadie. Okay, well, I guess it's a good thing you're developing your own sense of style. - What are you doing? - Oh. I was washing my hands. - 'Cause... - No, you know what I mean. No, I don't. I really don't, Nicky. Don't call me that. Okay, fine. Nicole! You told Shay about mom and Alex. - No, I didn't. - You're lying. Why are you trying to ruin my life? That's... I don't even know what that is. That's crazy! What did I ever do to you? You're the reason Derek stopped talking to me, aren't you? You tell him some kind of stories about me? Look, I really don't know what you're talking about. But I love you an... Hey! Come on! Why are you... What the... Fuck! Geez! - Sadie! - Hey. - What are you doin'? - Look... I don't wanna cause problems and... I-I feel like I'm just getting in the way here 'cause, like, the whole thing's... - Don't freak out. - Oh, my... - What happened? - It was an accident. - So what happened? - Okay, fine. Um, I was trying to explain to Nicole that I didn't tell Shay about you and Alex, because how would I know about you two... Uh... Ho-ho-hold on. - Did she hit you? - Okay, it was an accident! It's not like that! It was just a... It was an argument. And she got carried away. I don't think that she meant to hurt me, Chloe. I'm sorry. You're not going anywhere. This is ridiculous! Where have you been? You know me. Off doing drugs and having unprotected sex. Sit down. Sit down! You hit Sadie? Come on! You're going back to school next week, and when you do, you're gonna start seeing the counselor. - I didn't touch her! - Yeah. Well, you know, I wanted to call the cops because nothing else will get through to you. Mom, she... She does this. She's a liar. She's lying to you! I guess you're just gonna have to tell the counselor all about it. Goodnight, Nicole. Hey, Nicky. Sadie. A little black eye? I could do much worse than that. Don't, Nicky. You're scaring me. You should be scared. If you don't leave me and my mom alone, I really will hurt you. I know you don't mean that. You're just confused. Ow! Sadie. A little black eye? I could do much worse than that. Don't, Nicky. You're scaring me. If you don't leave me and-and my mom alone, I really will hurt you. Shay! Come on in. - Hey. What's wrong? - Have you heard from my dad? No, I haven't. Why? Because I can't get a hold of him. I even tried him at work and they said he didn't come in today. Did he say that he had anything to do? Something's wrong. He wouldn't just disappear on me like this. All right. All right. Well, let's, let's figure this out. Okay? Let's, let's call the police. Mm-hmm. Okay. Well, thank you, officer. Bye. Well, the good news is, there have been no local accidents today and he's not in the hospital. And the cops are gonna let us know if they, you know, hear anything. So... Yeah, that's good. Mm-hmm, yeah. Yeah, listen, Shay. About your dad and I... Don't care about that right now. Okay. But I want you to know... that he wanted to tell you a while ago. And... for some reason I wasn't ready or I... I don't know. It was stupid of me. And I'm sorry. It... It's okay. Hey... you know... your dad is a great guy. And I know we're gonna find him. Okay? I'm sure that his car broke down and his phone died or something. That's all. Hm. Yeah, he's not very good about charging it. Yeah. I mean, nobody is. I'm sure that's all it is. I'm sure he's fine. What happened to your eye? Hey, what were you doing yesterday driving Shay's dad's car? Hey. Um, would you just lie down, just like right there for a sec? - Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah? Yeah. Okay. Now, go on, lie down. I just don't want anyone to see us. You know? I'm nervous. You're really cute. You're so cute. Are you nervous? No... Uh! Oh, fuck! Fuck! Oh, my God! Oh, fuck! Nicole? You killed him? What did you do? Nicky? - What did you... - Nicole? - Mom! - Chloe! - Chloe, she killed him! - Mom! Oh, oh, shit! Oh, my God. Oh, my God! What the f... Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, my God! Chloe, help! She's gonna kill me! Help her! She went crazy! Help! Help! Help! Please help! Help! Help! Nicole! Stop, Nicky! Stop! Please! Chloe! Wait! Wait! Wait, you have to help! She's trying to kill him! She-she's trying to... Can you please call the police? Please call the police! - Call the police! Please! - What did you do? Please! This is a joke. Why did you pick up the knife? So she wouldn't stab me with it. - What would you have done? - What made you hit your aunt? I already told you. I didn't hit her. Your mom says you did. My mom was at work. So how did Sadie get a black eye? Because it would just be impossible for her to give herself a black eye, now, wouldn't it? You think she gave it to herself? Yes. Or... Or Alex clocked her when she killed him. Then she, what, planted your locket on him? You really think I would be that stupid? Oh, so you're saying you'd be smarter? - If you murdered someone. - Yes. Your friend, Shay, says you shoved Alex pretty hard yesterday mornin', shortly before he was murdered. Did Sadie orchestrate that, too? Or the girl you hit at school? You have quite the temper, don't you, Nicole? Sadie. A little black eye? I could do much worse than that. Don't, Nicky. You're scaring me. You should be scared. If you don't leave me and my mom alone, I really will hurt you. I know you don't mean that. You're just confused. Ow! Okay, let's go through this again. And this time, try the truth. You're not exactly the definition of a master criminal, are you, Sadie? A neighbor saw you and Derek walking into the woods holding hands this morning. Is my mom coming soon? Isn't your mother dead, Sadie? I'm not crazy. I don't mean... I mean my big sister. She's like my mom. I call her mom. She takes care of me. She's always taking care of me. You wanna tell us why we found strands of your hair in Alex's car? Is she coming? She's coming, right? Chloe doesn't wanna see you, Sadie. She's with her daughter. - But that's impossible. - Why is that impossible? Because... Because Nicky's been dead for, like, ten years. - Dead? - How did she die? She got hit by a car when she was, like, seven. Sadie... A forensic psychiatrist will be able to tell us if you really believe that. I tried to help, I tried to, like, stop it from happening. I tried to save her, and I couldn't. Like... We know that isn't true. Just level with us. - Why did you do all this? - Chloe was so sad after that. But, like, I made her feel better. I helped her. All right. She's fuckin' fruit loops. Let's get the psych boys in here. She needs me. And I need her. We're all each other has. We're family.
