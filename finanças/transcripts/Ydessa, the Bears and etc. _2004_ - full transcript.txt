THIS COLLECTION OF PHOTOGRAPHS GATHERED BY YDESSA FROM AROUND THE WORLD WAS INSPIRED BY A PHOTOGRAPH OF HER COUSIN, SZLAMUS ZWEIGEL WHO DIED AT AUSCHWITZ A child with a teddy bear. Two children with a teddy bear. Two grown-up girls with two teddy bears. Three toddlers with three teddy bears. And two bears with two older ones. And a tiny one with a large family. Look at it, in the lower right corner. It's the punctum of this photograph. And the common thread of the collection YDESSA Hendeles exhibited in Munich, at the end of 2003. Hundreds and hundreds of photographs. In every one of them, we see a teddy bear. This installation, which she named Partners (The Teddy Bear Project), was part of a larger exhibition in which YDESSA had the triple role of collector, exhibition curator, and installation artist. A DOCUMENTARY FILM BY Soon, we want to learn more about the lady with a name from a novel, YDESSA, who imagined all of this. On site, there are two clues. What we see and hear about her on a monitor set up in the museum's lobby. YDESSA talks like an artist. The other clue is found on the only two captions in the entire exhibition. Here she is in her crib, with a teddy bear. Here's her mom. Here's her dad. And the same dad, only his sleeve showing. YDESSA wanted to allude yet again to the Holocaust he survived. As she grew up, this little girl amassed over 2,000 photographs. The bear we see here. Is it a childhood memory that became an obsession? Or merely a topic to narrow the choices? Or the theme of an exhibition that fills two rooms, from floor to ceiling? I had to talk to this woman to find out. It's so full, that we long for emptiness. I flew to Toronto, where she lives. She established a foundation and a gallery there. That's where we met. She seems to live in osmosis with the artworks she loves. She gives them a lot of space in the rooms of her gallery. An entire room for Katharina Fritsch. Which of the two is more mysterious? YDESSA, with her long hair? Or this ghost, near a pool of black blood? Here's another work by the same artist. Money. At a preview opening... YDESSA knows how to play by the rules of the artistic milieu. She's renowned for her superb collections of contemporary art and photographs. Also for her unique status of "collector-curator-artist." She herself makes the bouquets, in the Puppy Vases by Jeff Koons. Her profession of faith is clear and sincere. YDESSA values the meaning of the works more than their market value. Yet, it's worth noting that, while she drives a Citroën 2CV, she's wealthy enough to buy artworks worth up to $800, 000. To buy them, store them, and exhibit them when and how she wants. That said, we came here to see her Teddy Bear Project. She knows that and carries her teddy purse. She shows us a teddy bear. She says that bear started it all. Then she did some research, and found these unique photographs. It took her ten years. Are visitors aware of her unique quest? Documentary reality is about real people. This real child appearing in a photo printed on real photographic paper. But soon, reality slips away, dividing itself, drifting towards fiction, towards a script. Once upon a time, there was a sister and a brother who were very close during childhood. Later, they turned their backs on one another. The little girl quarreled with a neighbor. Then eccentric characters, or somewhat peculiar, stirred up the family circle. The sister studied ballet. In high school, all the boys were in love with the literature teacher. The brother had become very romantic, and found himself on a three-way trip. Jules and Jim, maybe? With a beauty. Other fiancés were athletic. Then they started a family. There are still free women out there. Snapshots of women in risqué poses. And snapshots of men in their deep brotherhood and their penchant for violence. Then problems occur. Real puzzles. Sometimes, things are worked out. We all come together and have a laugh. For children, it's not so simple. They suddenly feel abandoned. The train of life speeds up, it all goes faster and faster. It all piles up. As soon as I came into this room, I felt a bit claustrophobic. I felt the effect of so many photos piled one on top of another, the staircases going up, and the cabinets bulging with information. I felt like I was almost being suffocated by somebody else's obsession. There was no way to absorb all the information. There was something threatening about the sheer volume of it. You couldn't escape it. Everywhere you looked, there were teddy bears. They appeared everywhere like in a hall of mirrors multiplying endlessly. Sometimes the bear is large, right in the middle and easy to spot. Sometimes, we look for the bear. You no longer look at the image, nor the people. One of the risks of this game. Yet there are so many children, so many people who are more captivating than a teddy bear. Yes, we do think about that. All these small black-rimmed frames. Like bereavement stationery. We also think of a columbarium. Artfully arranged boxes containing the ashes of the deceased. It crosses our mind. We assume that most of the persons we see here are dead, but not all of them. Not Ydessa's mother, anyway, whom we met in Toronto. She shows us a young man, and herself as a young girl, soon after their return from Auschwitz. Then they were married. And YDESSA was born in Marburg in December, 1948. That's where she grew up until age five. Then the family emigrated from Germany to Canada. They enjoy flipping through Ydessa's childhood photo albums. There are no earlier photo albums. Which is the case for the families of deportees. There's only this photograph of a grandmother. CURATOR Knowing Ydessa's family circumstances, we first assume she borrowed photographs from other families, to assemble an imaginary album. But she obviously went way beyond her personal quest, to create a panorama for a wide audience, in which each detail can catch the eye of visitors. Some pictures make them react, or resonate in their own memory. I think this exhibition is marvelous. It's inevitably touching to witness such a moment frozen in time. We get acquainted with many people. Each one, so unique. A unique moment, gone forever. This group of beach goers shouts its joy of the moment. But one of them is bidding us farewell. There's a sense that these moments are forever lost. And when pictures have started to fade, it's even worse. Adding to the feeling of irremediable loss is the deterioration of the photographs. And when part of the picture is out of focus or blurred... we fear that the very memory of that person dissolves. As for this sweet and soft little girl, dressed up like the pale bear she hugs, she takes us back, as does this whole exhibition, to our fading childhood. The bears that we see in the exhibition are the same ones that appear on the photographs. YDESSA managed to buy the photos, as well as the bears shown in them. These belonged to two brothers from Ottawa. Photographed in 1908. Then life separated them. It's amazing that YDESSA has found in two different cities, the two bears now reunited. Displayed atop the original photographs. All the teddy bears we see have documents proving their identity. The collector has precise motivations that are somewhat concealed by the picturesque display. It's more like a showcase exhibiting people who have either chosen or agreed to be represented. Pictures that comply with how they wanted to be remembered from the day the picture was taken, or by an amateur. Or by a real photographer, when they went to a studio. They'd dress up nicely. There'd be a backdrop of draped fabric. Or a fake sky scape. And a rug, or a setting. They'd dare to exchange an official kiss, during 1/10th, or 1/5th of a second, or longer. As for children, they'd dress them up to take them to the photographer's studio. They'd bring their own bear, or the photographer had one handy to soften up the kids. Every studio had a bench for children's photographs. In conformity, there was some variety. If you pay close attention to the benches, do you still notice the children? But we do notice the Hitler salute. And the amazing eyes of this little girl. Most of the photographs seem to be taken in Germany, or in the United States. We found one taken in Berlin, Ontario. There's a small series... devised to entertain young and old alike... of kids taking pictures of teddy bears. There's a series with all forms of wagons, wheelbarrows, mini strollers, strollers, mini carriages, and carriages. There's the predictable "seaside vacation" series. It's entertaining to see the swimsuits in vogue at the time. We almost forget to ask, "Why bring a teddy bear to the beach?" Here are gathered little girls with their pre-war hairdos. With a very large bow on the head. Decorated like a gift, or an Easter egg. There are two exceptions in these photos. A girl with a black bow... and my own presence. Improper because I didn't have a bear. Here are sportsmen. Was the teddy bear a mascot? A veiled message to the family? And now, sportswomen, then groups of women and children. And always with teddy bears, for company or comfort. So there's a self-portrait from the 20th century in the Teddy Bears. Then, we get to the third room. The building that houses the museum is steeped in this horrible tragedy. The same walls surround the exhibition. I thought it was remarkable that YDESSA, obviously a Jewish person, and someone who's marked by memories of the Holocaust, would want to exhibit the show in this environment. I found it remarkable. I don't know if it's brave or foolish. In any case, it was certainly out of the ordinary. I agree, it was extremely brave and very meaningful. But history writes itself, even on innocuous pictures. Teddy bears found their way from Army to family. Here we see children who loved their parents, and whose father was in the military, perhaps even among the worst. It was wartime, but the children played. They also played with other children whose fathers weren't in the military, or whose parents were Jewish. Suddenly, I thought of a children's book, Otto, written and illustrated by Tomi Ungerer. I slipped it into this film. Because it literally says what the exhibition implies with its title: Partners. We wonder if the children visiting the exhibition also enjoy seeing these naked women. In any case, they observe the bears, a cat on wheels... and a stuffed dog. It's a piece by Maurizio Cattelan, the artist who also created Him, the statue of Hitler. YDESSA says this dog poses the question of reality and fiction. Either way, it's hard to tell whether the dog's watching the watchman, or the watchman's watching the dog. When the watchman breaks for lunch, a watch woman tells us her side of the story. For some, it's a speedy affair, indeed. And there are very few who stoop to look at the photographs at floor level. Don't assume that the ones on the bottom are of lesser importance or of lesser interest. Quite the contrary. We discovered a particularly interesting series. Yet another series, rather strange. Small bears, barely two inches tall. Much smaller than the one in this soldier's hand. They were custom-made with eyes placed up high, for soldiers leaving for war. YDESSA has one at home, and another one steeped in history. The other teddy bears in Ydessa's room are displayed as in the bedrooms of little girls and teenagers who visit teddy bear websites, and communicate by e-mail, and chat, as they say, with other teddy-bear-philes. The difference in this room is that each bear has a listed value on the teddy bear market. More than a collection, it's stuffed equity encircling Ydessa's bed. As if tenderness and business could rhyme. She's the happy owner, among others, of two rare, colored bears. One is battery-powered and his eyes light up, unless the battery's dead. And another blue one. She started her collection, twenty years ago. We learned that an unnamed Canadian had paid $97, 615 for this bear. Aside from auction sales, YDESSA buys online, mostly through eBay. She created a real market for what she loves. And she has her network. I recall her telling me she clinched over 8, 000 deals. Here, she sorts things out. I think she knows every photograph. She has a whole filing system, organized by categories. First, second, and third choices. The pictures are tucked away into transparent acid-free sleeves. She can't resist showing us a few. YDESSA lives alone, and works by herself in this 18-room house, where some things are much too large... and others, much too small. In her vast kitchen, she prepares the page layout of a book about her Teddy Bear Project collection. She's used up all the space around the central kitchen island to lay out what's called the "railroad" of her upcoming book. She moves pictures around, tries different pairings. Faced with such obsessive energy, such patience and meticulousness. Plus the immensity of the kitchen and the enormity of the project, the length of Ydessa's red hair, and the length of the "railroad," I was overcome by dizziness. Calm will return to the Munich installation, which is just as contrast rich as the double image of the bear. A wild and dangerous animal, which as teddy bear becomes the very image of tenderness and comfort. I wish to salute YDESSA Hendeles. Intelligent and eccentric, imbued with a certain fame deriving from her collections, and all alone amidst her treasures. She deserves our admiration. And cheers to Elliot. And now YDESSA withdraws into her English-style manor, which could be the perfect setting for a mystery film. She hides herself away behind a hidden door. And what's left after this whirlwind of photographs? A few images. This one, in which people are posed with such intensity, that we can hardly bear their gaze. Or this group. We could entitle this one Gazes. Who's gazing at whom or what? And who's gazing at the camera? There's a couple gazing at each other. One is gazing at the camera. That means you. That means me. And there are always a few loners. This child enjoying the silence. This man on a path, with his teddy bear, paws inwards. And this teddy bear woman, the most mysterious of all. Standing stiffly in the snow.
