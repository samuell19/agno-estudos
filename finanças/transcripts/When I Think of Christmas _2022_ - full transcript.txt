Well, there's a lot to do, and I couldn't let you go it alone. Sorting, hauling... And... and... Christmas. Of course. And seeing that sign in front of our house is so weird. I know. But I think you'll like the condo. Come on, let's get your stuff. Aw, Mom. It looks so beautiful in here! Look at that tree... gorgeous. Clarkson's Farm, of course. And the reindeer that Dad made outside... the stockings... Oh, no! I just realized... I don't have a fireplace at the condo. That is okay. We will find somewhere else to hang them. But, speaking of moving... I was expecting to see lots of packing boxes. There's no reason to rush the inevitable. Mom, after Christmas, we're gonna have, like, five days to pack up your whole house! I know, but this is our last Christmas here. Can't we enjoy it for a little while? A little. Nana's piano. Oh, such a richer sound than my upright in New York. I always loved this thing. Me too. All right, young lady, let's get you upstairs and freshened up. We've got a big day ahead. Can't wait. Do you think Dad's old posters will fit in the new place? Well, we'll have to measure. When do I get to see your new condo, by the way? Well, uh... we can go tomorrow morning. - I get the key tonight. - I can't wait. Send me the Atlantic Ridge Energies ledger as soon as you got it, okay? Thanks. That doesn't sound very vacation-y. Ugh, sorry. I'm drafting an appeal that I need to file in January. Over Christmas? Don't worry... You are not even gonna notice. You ready to go? Yes. But I believe... we need these! Aw! The Santa mugs! Mm-hmm. Where did Dad find these, again? Chattanooga. You were almost four... It was the year before he passed. He played an extra gig that night, which barely paid for the gasoline, but I fell in love with these cups the minute I saw them. Look. It's a shame we can't take this doorframe with us across town. So many memories here. It's gonna be hard to say goodbye. It will. Oh! Look at the time. Oh, better go. Sara Thompson! You're back home! Mr. T! Hi! And what have you got in that handsome cup? Oh, well, it was cocoa from the bookstore. Mm. Well, no need to try the rest, because now you got the best... from Hickory Real Estate! Serving the same at the office, just a half a block west! Ted Ramsey, are you always selling? Oh, why are you asking? Can I interest you in another condo? Ladies and gentlemen! Can I have your attention, please? It's almost time... to light our tree! For all of you out there new to our "Lights Carols" festival, we've got a real treat for you! Two weeks chock-full of so many fun events, and on our last night... The big Christmas concert! Now, I am pleased to announce our brand-new concert producer is our very own Josh Hartman! Thanks. I'll be brief... because Christmas is coming and I've got a lot of work to do! This is, uh, quite an honor. Unexpected, but great. Auditions will be happening in two days at the civic theater, and I am really looking forward to hearing the voices of my hometown! Well, we are thrilled to have a big Nashville performer take over, and, oh, by the way, Josh? No pressure. And now, it is my honor to commence our Christmas season! Are you ready? Are you ready? Yeah! Josh, would you like do the honors? I would love to. I proclaim the Oakcrest Carols Lights Festival has begun in three... Two, one... Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas, sweetheart. Merry Christmas, Mom. Anna! Ahh! Merry Christmas! Right back at ya! Sara, hi! Isn't that something about Josh? I bet you're jumping for joy. It... sure is something. It was kind of a surprise. Oh! Josh? Hi. Hi. Uh... wow, I-I haven't seen you once in ten years during the holidays, and... and here you are, home already. Hey, congratulations. You'll be a natural at producing the concert. Oh, yeah. Well, we'll see about that. Josh? We'd better get back. Ahem. I'll see you around. Yeah. See ya. Ugh, another year, another hot-cocoa stomachache. So, did you know that Josh was back in town? No. I mean, his uncle did mention once that he thought that Josh would be perfect to take over producing the concert, but I thought Josh was dug in in Nashville. What was it like... Seeing him again? Fine. Why wouldn't it be fine? Well, was he excited about the concert? Uh, yeah, he seemed kind of nervous. Well, two weeks to produce a concert, when you've never done it... I'd be nervous, too. - Mm. - I'm gonna turn in early. We're gonna go see the condo in the morning. Oh, no. The condo. What? Ted Ramsey was supposed to give me the keys tonight. Well, with the Cocoa Crawl tonight, his office is probably still open, so I'll just walk there and pick 'em up. Oh, I can drive you. I live in Manhattan... we walk. Mm. That's right. Manhattan. Hello? Anybody here? Hey, sorry, there's no cocoa left. Oh. Hi. Again. No hot chocolate, but thanks. So you're helping your uncle out? I am, yeah. Combination office floater and, uh, cocoa barista. Do you need something? Ted was supposed to give my mom the keys to her new condo, but didn't happen. I think the locksmith dropped those keys off yesterday. Let me take a look. Okay. So... you are working here and producing the Christmas concert? Yeah, that's the idea. What happened to Nashville? Nothin'. It's still there. Grand Ole Opry, Bluebird Cafe. Yeah. I mean... Yeah, I know what you mean. I was just doing my thing in Music City. Uncle Ted called and said they were in a panic to find a new producer, and he convinced me I was the right guy for the job, so here I am. That's great. Josh? Are you ready to go? Can you just give me a second? Yeah, I'll be parked right outside. You're making new friends. Well, it's a friendly place. Congratulations to your mom. My uncle says that the condo's a perfect place for her. Anything else? Look, Josh, I'm glad to see you're back. Now you have music and family. It's everything you said you ever wanted, back when... When we were, um... ahem, making plans? Yeah. Yeah... what a waste that was. Uh... look, I'm sorry. I've got concert meetings in the morning, auditions in two days, so... Josh... Forget it. I can see you have your hands full. Yeah. I am busy, so. Merry Christmas. This is so cute! Oh, really? I'm glad you like it. Huh. This is it. - That's my unit. - Hi. Hi. Is this your condo? - Yes, it is. - Oh, I'm sorry. My daughter told me this unit was empty. I'm trying to unload this tree here. Um... I'm George Brooks. My daughter lives next door. Oh! Oh, well, hi. I'm Anna. This is my daughter, Sara. Oh, nice to meet you guys. Well, I'll get out of your way. No, no. Please, please don't We're just here to take some measurements. We can take a visitor's spot. I don't move in till after Christmas. - You sure? - Yes. Oh, I really appreciate it. Well, I'm sure I'll see you around. I'm doing a little work on her kitchen. If there's anything you need... Anything at all... Just... just ask. Oh, well, thanks. We'll be fine. But you never know! You never know. Yeah. He's cute! Oh! Mom, I love it! Do you really? I mean, it is nice. You know what? I know you're right about selling the house. It's less maintenance, for sure. Change can be good. You're right. It can. Oh, honey, I've got to go to the hospital. I thought you had the time off? Well, I do, but a water pipe broke, and they're having to move patients. I really should be there. I forgot. Maybe you can cover for me. Cover what? I'm supposed to be a judge for the gingerbread house contest in town... - Uh... - In 30 minutes. No, no, Mom, I do not have time to... Okay. Thank you. I love you! I love you. It's gingerbread. How stressful can it be? Okay, everyone! The time has come! One lucky boy or girl is going to win the 68th Annual Oakcrest Gingerbread House Competition. Now let's meet our judges. From the Thompson family, past winner Sara Thompson. And our other judge... Our brand-new maestro... Josh Hartman! Your uncle make you do this? No, my uncle just asked me to do this. I didn't know you'd be here. Same. Funny coincidence, huh? Mm. Hilarious. Okay! Let's get started. Ooh! Very nice! Love the angles on the farmhouse! It's nice, but... Whoa! Look at the frosted snow on Santa's cottage, oh, and the feel of a glowing fire inside. It's not about "feeling". It's about skill. - It's about artistry. - It's about planning. It's about passion! What's "passion"? - Oh, it's when... - Uh! You know... why don't we, uh... huddle? Okay, uh, do we have a winner? Yeah, number one. Best layout, best execution. No. Number six. Great imagination. Really sings to me. Oh, boy. Um... Okay! Uh, the winner is... number seven! Sara? You dropped this. Thanks. I'll, uh, see you around. Yep. Hey, how do you remember it? What? Us. I gotta get going. You know what? Three years we were together, dreaming about our future, and right when we had an actual plan, I turned around and you were gone. Okay, well, that's not exactly how it happened. We had a showcase lined up in Nashville, - and you ghosted me. - A showcase is no guarantee! That's life! There are no guarantees. It's complicated, but I am not the first person to choose to go to college. Can you seriously blame me for that? No, but I can blame you for bailing on me without so much as a goodbye. I had to go right away. Okay, great. You know what? This is useless. No. Just because I gave up on music does not mean that I gave up on you and me. Okay? I wrote. I called you dozens and dozens of times, and you never got back to me. You are the one who quit on us, Josh. Wow. Look, Sara. It's the holidays. We're probably going to bump into each other, so why don't we just get through this and go our separate ways? It should be really easy for you. Oh, honey... you know, Ted must have had his reasons, for sending Josh to judge. You know, he's always liked the two of you together. Always said you were the next "Faith and Tim". Well, that ship sailed a long time ago. Plus, Josh isn't any fun anymore. Really? What did he say? He feels like I shouldn't have strung him along for so long if I was just gonna run off to college in the end anyway. Well, you had a great scholarship to Yale. Who passes up that? I didn't, but I was really confused back then. I know. I mean, I definitely could have handled things better with him. Well... Oh, I'll get it. You, uh, sure you have the right house? Very funny. It's a gift for your mom. Oh, Josh? Come on in! What is this? Oh, ho... Swiss chocolate? Oh, no chance those will make it till Christmas. Mm-mm. You didn't have to get me a Christmas present. Oh, no, it's a thank-you from Uncle Ted, and everyone at Hickory Realty. For becoming such a valued customer this year. That's so sweet. Josh? Something wrong? My rehearsal pianist fell through, got a gig in Memphis, and now my backup's falling out. Aren't auditions tomorrow? Yeah, um, listen, I should get going. I need to deal with this. Enjoy the candy. - Okay, thank you. - Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. No good deed goes unpunished, hey? Guy comes back to rescue his hometown... Now look. There's always you. Me? Mm. You play piano beautifully, ad you can sight-read. Oh, I do not have time for Josh's auditions. Okay? We have Christmas shopping to do, and packing. This is a vacation, not a military operation. Yeah, but the move, and I have this appeal that I'm working on. I am so proud of how driven you are, but you do love to play. You go do what you have to do, and I'll finish the cookies, okay? Fine. Josh? Hey, um, if I were able to play piano for your auditions tomorrow, how long would it take? Uh, I don't know, three hours, tops? Okay. I can do it. Wait a minute. When's the last time you even played a piano? With my coffee this morning. Seriously? Fair enough. You go with your other choice. No, no, no, no, no! Uh... 9:00 a.m., sharp? Are you sure you can audition all these acts in three hours? Ah, I'll just make it work. Unlike the law, showbiz is spontaneous. Brr-rr-rr-rr. Um-um-um-um-um-um-um, ahh... Just give me a second.

Thanks for today. You bet. Honey, are you sure you can't come to Santa Jam? Too much to do. But you go have fun with Imogene. So, is this what it's like for you in New York? 14-hour days, and then home to last week's casserole? Absolutely not. I get take-out there. Oh! You don't? I'm kidding. Sort of. Sara, please come. This is our last year here... That makes it a one-of-a-kind Christmas. Right? Well, maybe I could use a break. You could. Anna! Sara! You have got to try Sherry Romero's icicle churros. You two go. I'm just here to get some fresh air. You sure? Yeah. I'll be right there. - I'll find you. - Yeah. Thank you, thank you! Well, we're here to keep your Christmas merry, and to add to the cheer, here is Josh Hartman. Whoo! Thank you. All right, let's give it up for Lynette Sparks and her band! I just wanted to remind everyone, that we have our big Lights Christmas Carols concert coming up in just 12 days. Since it's been a long-running, seven-decade tradition for this town, I better see each and every one of you at the ticket booth, all right? All right, you take it away, Lynette. Now wait a minute, Josh. We're not letting you off this stage without a song! Oh, no, no, no, no. I came to see you perform. Oh, no. Come on up here with us. Come on! Okay. Let me tell you something... This guy can really rock. Hi. I'll... I'll take the cinnamon-apple, please. You know what? Better make it a double. Thank you. Wow. Never seen Josh Hartman surrender a stage before. Hey. I thought you had to work. Ah, I needed a break. Hmm. Yeah, I know that feeling. So, is that what this whole producing-the-concert thing's about? A break from Nashville? Something like that. When my uncle called, it seemed like a good chance for me to take a break from the grind for awhile. Makes sense. And I bet Ted convinced the town that your Nashville success would rub off on the concert. If only they knew. Knew what? Ahem. What'd you think of Lynette's guitar-playing? She might be a good fit for the concert's band. - Yeah, she's all right. - I mean, she's no Sara Thompson. Well, you may joke, but back in the day, we were pretty good. - Yeah. - You especially. It's a shame you didn't take the stage tonight. I was looking forward to watching you. Well, I didn't come here to sing. I came here to produce a show with fresh talent... and fresh I am not. Oh, come on. What are you talking about? I'd better get back to the ticket booth. 'Kay. Thanks for stepping in today. You really helped me out. Um, you start rehearsals tomorrow, right? Did you find another pianist? Yeah, I got one solid "maybe". You want me to play? Really? Yeah. Believe it or not, I had fun. Between the hassle of packing and the stress of work, I could use a little fun. "Fun". Right. Yeah, I could use that, too. All right. You're on. - Goodnight. - Night. - Oh! Hi. - Hi. I was just dropping a book off for my daughter and I saw these on top of your car. I'm not sure if you left them or... I did, I did. Gosh. Oh, please, come in. Okay. Can you put them right there? Yeah, for sure. Oh! Thank you. You're welcome. I swear, I'd forget my head. I was just putting away some china. Oh, my mother used to have some nice china. I re-surfaced all her cabinet doors with glass, so she could see them. Oh, that sounds lovely. Actually, I'm doing the same thing for Caity right now, and I'd be happy to do yours, if you like. Oh. Heh. W-Well, thank you, b-but, no, I'm fine. Okay. No, I understand. Hoo! I was bound to be bad at this. Bad at what? Pitching myself as a carpenter... Which I was for a while in my 20s, till I became an oil rigger. I get it. I know what starting over feels like. Yeah. Bet you handled it better than I do. George? Do you think you could do the interior of the cabinets in a cream? Absolutely. - Well, that'd be great. - Okay! I'll... I'll see you soon. - Okay. Sounds good. - Okay. ♪ And heav'n And nature sing ♪ ♪ And heav'n and nature sing ♪ And heav'n And heav'n ♪ ♪ And nature sing Okay. That was great. Um, I'd like to try something.

And do you realize that no one's heard us sing in nearly a decade? That's crazy, right? I didn't feel the rust at all. Same. How did you feel? Uh, kind of liberated? Yeah. Music'll do that. I owe you an apology. For the way I left. I should have told you that I got a scholarship offer, and that I was considering it. Yeah, you should have. I just chickened out... and that's inexcusable. Yeah. It kinda was. It was the hardest decision that I've ever had to make. I knew I'd be disappointing you, but I was afraid if I told you, that you would talk me out of it, and then I'd be letting other people down. Like who? My teachers... my family. Well, I mean... it is a shame I wasn't on that list. Honestly? I just thought, somehow, we would always stay together, no matter what. What can I say? I'd never been in love before. Me neither. Sara! Don't forget my Christmas party's tomorrow night! Remind your mom, too! I-I will! I hope we can make it! You hope? My Uncle Ted'll be crushed if you guys don't show. We have to pack and I'm working on this appeal. I can't just brush it off and hope for the best, so. You know what? I think maybe you're just afraid to trust your own talent. Mm, says the guy who wouldn't sing on stage at Santa Jam. All right, look, I need to post the rest of the schedule. Okay. ♪ Joy to the world ♪ Mm-hmm-hmm-hmm-mm ♪ And heav'n and nature sing Well, someone's happy! What's gotten into you? I did a little singing at rehearsal, with Josh. Oh, really? How lovely. Can you hand me that? Yeah. How did it feel? It was fun, don't get me wrong, but it's also sad, just thinking about everything. You mean having to choose between Josh and college? No... yeah. Josh, and making music. You know, I made that decision, and went back and forth a million times in my head, over the years, wondering if I made a mistake... was I ever even good enough to make it? Did you think I was good? Honey, I thought you were extraordinary. Did you say that to me back then? I'm sure I did. I know it was a tough time, but you chose wisely. Well, I chose what you wanted me to choose, so you're a little bit biased. Well, look how well how it turned out. If you say so. Uh, I have some work to do, so I'll see you later. Okay. Good morning, Sara. I didn't sleep well last night. Oh, well, that's not like you. I couldn't stop thinking about what you said. Sara, years ago, I never meant to make your decision for you. That's what it felt like. I'd lived a life in music, and I knew it was hard. I understand. Very sensible. And now I can afford to pay my bills and a whole lot more, and, uh... what if I've missed out on my best life? Oh, Sara... I'm sorry. I-I don't have time for this. I've got to get back to work, you've got to drop stuff off at the condo, right? Yeah, a bunch of linens and stuff. Go. I'll be fine. Okay. Don't worry about the dishes! I'll do them later! - Oh. Hi! - Hi! You must be Anna. I'm Caitlin Brooks. George's daughter. It's so nice to meet you. Oh, Dad has been saying how lucky I am to have you as a neighbor. Has he, now? Well, I guess I'll just have to try to live up to his opinion. - Oh... - Hey! We have to hurry. Do you have the cookies for the assembly? A fellow teacher and neighbor. I've got 'em. Sprinkles and sugar, both. I said chocolate-frosted. No chocolate-frosted, and Susie Braun's mom is gonna put me in a timeout. Leonard, Leonard! You are bringing the chocolate-frosted. I'm bringing the chocolate-frosted. - Uh-huh. - Yes! Yes. That's what I said. Okay. Nice to meet you! Nice to meet you. She's lovely. Yeah, I think so, too. Is it too soon to start your cabinets? Um... No. That would be fine. Okay. Great. Hi. Hey. What are you doing here? I, uh, needed to stretch my legs before they went numb. Whatcha doing? Yeah, I believe there's a cherished theatrical term for this... "grunt work". It's my attempt at a set on a shoestring budget. Yeah, a year ago, I was playing national tours. Now look... painting snowflakes. What really happened with your music, Josh? Uh... the national tours were for headliners. I was just in the band. And I got frustrated, I decided to go all-in on myself, before it was too late. Too late? What were you, 29? Oh, come on, there are tons of guys in the "Home for Retired Musicians" by 29. Yeah, I said no to every single job and I spent every dime I had on my solo career. And? Oh, radio silence... until I landed this gig at the best club in town. - Nice! - Yeah, you would think. But... right before signing, they changed bookers, and I was out. But hey... Best thing that could've happened to my painting career. Um, I can stick around and help out, if you want. Don't you have a lot of work to do at your mom's? Mm, yeah, I'm slammed, but... No, you'll be more productive there than here. I really don't mind staying. Sara? You're the one that has a real career. You have a real career, too. Yeah, sure. Legions of adoring fans, wherever I turn. Come on. That's just fame. What happened to the guy I knew who was just in it because he loved the process? Please, just go. Okay. They're lovely! Really beautiful. Thank you, George. You're welcome. They still need to be painted, but maybe you can be my second reference. I've got Caity, but everybody knows your daughter'll vouch for you, right? Something wrong? No. No, everything is fine. What do I owe you for the cabinets? Oh, come on. Something's going on. It's either family or job. Which is it? Oh, it's just I'm working through something with my daughter. Oh... Oh, I'm sorry, George. I should just keep moving down my Christmas to-do list. Let me pay you for the cabinets. If you want to pay me back, why don't you just educate me on the highlights of an Oakcrest Christmas? Have you been to the Knothole Diner yet? No. It's almost noon. How about lunch? No, I really should get back... Well, don't you eat lunch? No, I... Yes, I do, I eat lunch. Well, good, 'cause I just heard of a great diner we could check out. So, where did you move here from, George? I came here from Iowa. Most of my work was out of town. Oh. The long hours away got to be too much for my ex-wife. When Caity moved here, I realized that... I needed to follow. Get to know my daughter again, make up for lost time. How's that going? It's getting there. It's never easy, making up for past mistakes. You speaking first-hand? Sara threw me a curve yesterday. You know, back in high school, she had to make a career choice. I remember trying so hard to advise without pushing... But? Now I'm not sure she's happy with her decision, or if I was objective enough. Ahh, well, it's a rare species... An objective mother. You know, her father was a musician. We nearly ended up broke. Being a performer became like a bad dream to me. It still is. Well... no one gives you a book on how to be the perfect parent. The way I look at it, you just stay in the batter's box and keep on swinging. We only get so much time with the ones we love. That's so true. You're pushing those my way. I am. Would you like to try one? - Absolutely! - I can't eat another bite. Thank you so much. I may be Mike Thompson... It is my name on the drum kit... But here's the real star of the band and my life... Anna Thompson. ♪ O, holy night ♪ The stars Are brightly shining ♪ ♪ It is the night Of our dear savior's birth ♪ ♪ Long lay the world In sin and error pining ♪ ♪ Till he appear'd ♪ And the soul felt its worth ♪ A thrill of hope ♪ The weary world rejoices ♪ For yonder breaks ♪ A new and glorious... Mom? I've never heard you sing like that. I'd forgotten about that recording. You were good. Really good! It's from another life. ♪ O, hear the angel voices... Was that life so terrible? It sure didn't sound like it, from the tape. How did you leave all that behind? Because we had to survive, honey. Uh, for some reason, I had it in my head that you would just sing backup for Dad, but you were so much more than that. Did you guys write together, too? How did you even meet? Th-There are so many things that you've never told me! I met your father... at a Lights Carols Christmas Concert. I never knew that. Yeah. He'd come down from Nashville with a band. There is such a thing as love at first sight. By the next Christmas, we were married and on the road together. Then you came along. Life wasn't perfect... but it was filled with music and love. Until it wasn't? Until it wasn't. Until that night when your father's car skidded off the road in that terrible rain, and then that life was over. And next came the hard part. Struggling and scrimping, and just trying to put one foot in front of the other, and keep us going. But you did. You saved us. Honey, I guess I was just always afraid that lightning could strike again. When you were a senior in high school, I saw you following in my footsteps. Falling in love with a handsome musician, imagining a fairytale life in music... and I was just so afraid that something like that could happen to you, and I wanted to protect you. Well, hearing all this helps me understand. Thanks for that. I am sorry, honey. I really should have told you this sooner. Uh, you should get ready for Ted's party. "We". We should go get ready for Ted's party. Uh, no, I cannot go. I have to work to do. - What? - Yeah. Ted Ramsey is one of this family's best friends. Yeah, but if I get my brief done now, then it means we have more time together tomorrow - to pack. - Packing? It's just packing! I... I don't have anything to wear, either. I think I can fix that. Come on! Come, come, come! Open it. It's not Christmas. Well, we got a tree, we got stockings... It's close enough. Oh... Mom! It's beautiful. Well, I'm a single mother in a small town who doesn't get to see her daughter nearly enough, and who worries that her daughter doesn't have nearly enough fun. Well, it's more than enough just to be home, helping you. This is me helping you back. And that's all I ever want for Christmas. Oh, it's so pretty. I can't wait to see it on you. Come on, let's go. You know this isn't an ugly Christmas sweater party, right? - Yeah, I know. - Okay. Sara! Hi! Come say hi to the Johnsons. Hey! Christmas music. You know, we should all sing. Um, can anyone play? Oh, you want singing? I heard Sara and Josh singing at rehearsal. They're dynamite! Oh, no, no. Yeah. "Sara and Josh!" Sara and Josh! Sara and Josh! Ahem. ♪ O, come all ye faithful ♪ Joyful and triumphant ♪ O, come ye O, come ye ♪ ♪ To Bethlehem ♪ Come and behold Him ♪ Born the King of Angels - ♪ O, come let us adore Him - ♪ O, come... ♪ O, come let us adore Him ♪ ♪ O, come let us adore Him ♪ Christ the Lord Whoo! Encore! Encore! One more! I gotta get going. Oh, Josh! Would Sonny desert Cher? I have to open the theater for a guy who's delivering the lights. Tonight? Yeah. Yeah, he's doing me a favor. Besides, you don't... You don't need me. You all have the real deal right here... Give it up for Sara Thompson! Whoo! - I told you they were great! - No, they were fantastic. How're the lights coming along? Uh, work in progress. Well, at least there was a light delivery tonight. That sounded super-fake. Yeah, about that, um... they were actually delivered this morning. Why did you leave the party, then? Uh, because I realized... after singing together again, I will never be as good solo as we were together. That is all in your head. It's not true. Believe it or not, I really have to get this done. You know, my mom and dad met at the Lights Carols concert... Right here, 34 years ago. I didn't know that. Mm. When I was five, my dad wrote my mom a Christmas song. She was gonna play it in that year's concert. But by December, we'd lost him. What happened to the song? I just found it. Where are you going with this? What if it were played in this year's concert? Are you serious? You think you could ever convince your mom to sing again? No, absolutely not. But... what if we did it? You and me. That's... that's crazy. That... Uh... but it... might actually work. Are you sure you want to do this? I want to dedicate it to my parents... show my mom that... even though dreams don't always come true the way you imagine, doesn't mean you should give up on them. I can relate to that. All right, I am off to go do some work with Josh at the theater. Okay! I like this. What? You know... energy, smiling. Please. It is just the caffeine, okay? Got to go! Well, have fun! ♪ Mm, mm, mm-mm ♪ Mm, hmm-hmm ♪ Mm ♪ Mm, hmm-hmm ♪ O, holy night ♪ The stars are brightly shining ♪ ♪ It is the night of our dear savior's birth ♪ All of my dad's cassettes are amazing. I want to listen to every one of 'em. And then, there's... this. Wow! This is incredible. I'm telling you... We can crush it. Sara... this song... It's your family's legacy. If this performance is for your mom... I think you should sing it solo. No, I could not begin to do that. You want your mom to rediscover the thrill of music, right? - Yeah. - Well, what's stronger than if it comes from you? We... are stronger, together. You said that. Remember? Yeah. Now remember, Ellie, on this one, just try to have fun, okay? - Okay! - Okay. All right. Watch me. I'll count you in, okay? Okay. Three, four... ♪ O Christmas tree ♪ O Christmas tree... ♪ How lovely... ♪ Are your... ♪ Your... Okay. Let's stop. Um... It's "branches," right, Ellie? I know, but I just keep forgetting. Okay, uh... Tell you what. If you forget again, why don't you just take a peak at the Christmas tree and it'll help you remember. That's not a Christmas tree! That's a piece of wood. That's fair. O-Okay, kiddo. There's Mom and Dad. That's it for today. I'll see you next rehearsal, okay? Bye! I'm proud of you, Ellie! The words will come. You're gonna be fine! Me, however? Total breakdown. Hi, Mr. Clarkson. Hey, Josh. Sara. We need a Christmas tree... 14... 16 feet at least? Oh, we're sold out of all the ones that big. What would you guys do with a tree that size, anyway? On stage, for the Lights Carols Concert. Anyway, thanks. You know, wait... I do have one about that size, down by the pond. I was gonna save it for next year, but... you're a good man, Josh, taking over the concert. You know, if you come back later this evening, that'd give me time to cut it and have it ready to haul. Fantastic! Uh, we will be back. Your mom sounded great on tape. Yeah, she did. Kinda reminded me of the first time I heard you sing, in sixth grade. Oh, please. You were way too busy chasing around Amanda Dobbs in the sixth grade. No way. Amanda couldn't harmonize like you. Nobody was better than the two of us together, huh? Are you ready for this? The moment of truth? All right, hit me. Wow! It's perfect. This is crazy. You need crazy in your life. I've... been having fun with you and-and... I mean, everybody enjoys a blast from the past, - but that's what it is... - Hey, Sara, are you happy? I'm content. Yeah? You could've fooled me. Um... Uh... we should call it a night. Uh... yeah. Mom, I have to finish this for my office somehow, before I'm at the theater by five. I will be in my cell. Okay. Hello? Hey. Yeah, I heard you mentioning you're gonna move some stuff out of your garage tomorrow morning... I'd like to offer my truck. Oh, George, that's so sweet, but you've done so much for me already. I'm starting to feel guilty. Ah, I like doing things for ya. Oh... okay, well, that'd be great. Yeah, I'll, uh, I'll see you tomorrow. What are we doing at the high school? Is this even legal? Oh, I'm not worried. I hear you're a great lawyer. Josh... Relax. The Mayor gave me a spare key, in case we needed some extra rehearsal space. Unbelievable. This hasn't changed at all since we were in high school! Where it all started, for you and me. Hmm. You sat there. Way too close to Amanda Dobbs! Come on. It was only platonic. I swear. And I would always sit... Wait. Where is the piano? It's out for service. Some sort of incident with a stumble and a cartwheeling tuba. And so how are we supposed to rehearse with no piano? Sit down. Take a seat. Sour gummy worms? Our ritual, remember? Whenever you got nervous about one of our shows... Which was, like, always... You would steer me here to the band room, we'd eat a whole bag until I blissed out and was ready to play for the King of England. Worked every time. And here I thought, when you stopped at the drug store, you were really just after cough drops. Ahh. Cover story. Mm. Admit it. You kind of feel like a kid again, hmm? A kid? After a decade of hard work? Funny, I've never thought of music that way. Mm. Your career's no cakewalk either. True. Look. There's the school's band-practice schedule. I remember, your mom used to slip the schedule into your backpack... Drove you crazy. Yes, it did. Worked, though. She always had your best interests in mind. Yeah, well, how do you think I ended up in law school? What do you mean? Nothing. Mom and I just keep going back and forth about where her opinion stopped and mine started, back when it came to choosing Yale. So you're saying your mom was the one who drove you to go to college? Oh... sure felt like it at the time. And I get it... She lost her husband, she had to raise me on her own during tough times... Right. Well, then, how could she not choose an education over the gamble of showbiz, right? Mm. She says she never meant to interfere, of course... like I just picked up on her instinct and chose the safest path on my own. Couldn't that be the case? Thing is... no matter your mother's influence... You had plenty of time to change your mind, Sara. A lot of years between then and now. True. Though maybe that's what it was always about for me, too... Survival, racing one step ahead of the next calamity. Right, but then you're as secure as a bank safe now. So why not go after fulfillment? Will you stop? You are not very good at hiding your agenda. What? Do you think they still do Christmas Tree Row? Let's find out. Want another one? Remember when we used to come here late night to decorate for orchestra? I do. One night, we stayed so late my mom was convinced our tree must look like Rockefeller Center. I've missed that laugh. Well, what can I say? You bring it out. I have a confession. I have spent years trying to convince myself that I wouldn't change a thing about the way things ended with us. That's not so. Hmm? You're the one thing I truly regret. And? That's... That's your cue. Josh, look, these past couple of weeks with you have been... wonderful. Okay, ahem. Let's pretend it's "Emotions for-Dummies" here. Are you saying that... Just maybe... During this whole time, working on the show, that you've had some feelings for me? Okay. "Some". Maybe. But it's probably just proximity. Mm. That must be coming from the skating rink. I love that song. I think you love music... and the music we make together. Look, Sara. I know you're a hugely successful attorney. You have every right to be proud. I'm proud of you. But can I ask you something? Yes. Is your heart racing as fast as mine is right now? Yeah. What if we could feel that way nearly all the time? ♪ It is the night of our dear savior's birth ♪ ♪ Long lay the world ♪ In sin and error pining ♪ Till He appears ♪ And the soul felt its... Ah! Hi! I'm sorry to scare ya. The door was open. - Don't stop. - Stop what? Don't stop singing. I was really enjoying that. You're just being kind. You have a beautiful voice. Well, you're gonna hear a lot better ones tomorrow night at the concert. Oh... um, speaking of the concert... I've been meaning to ask... do you want to go together? Uh... uh, well... you know, I-I usually go to that with Imogene. Okay. Yeah. I understand. No problem. But you could come w-with us? Uh... ah, I don't think so. I'll probably see if Caity wants to go. George... I really like you. I've made some big mistakes in my life. I've made a vow to myself to think things through and... and take them more slowly. Yeah, I made some mistakes, too. But I guess, um... I learned something different. You can't stay locked in the past. A real connection... That's a rare thing... and if you're lucky enough to find it, you grab it while you can. - Hello? - Hi, Josh. It's Becca in Dan Ross's office. I have a royalty check to send you. Not much, but I need your new address. Oh, uh, yeah, just send it to Hickory Real Estate. I'll text you the address. Great. Actually, I'm playing the Christmas concert in Oakcrest tomorrow night. Um, we're only a hour away. I-If Dan's interested, let me know, and I'll put some tickets at will-call for him. Sounds cool. All right. Cool. That's our show! Merry Christmas, Oakcrest. And... curtain. You guys will run up on stage behind us. We will all join hands. We bow... end of spectacular Christmas Concert. Tomorrow night, we do it for real. Get out of here, get to bed. Oh, hey, Ellie? I'll walk you to your mom. Okay. My lady? Sara, I have an idea that... Is everything okay? Look. Don't worry. Rough dress rehearsal, great show. My office texted me. Uh... The partners were so happy with the work that I did for the appeal... my boss and his wife invited me back to New York for their big New Year's party. Okay. Well, isn't that cause for celebration? Oh... sorry for interrupting. Josh, is your phone off? For rehearsal, yeah. Uh, your Nashville agent called the office and he will come to the concert. That's pretty neat, huh? Uh... I'll leave you to it. Thanks. You invited your agent? Yes. Why didn't you tell me? Uh, I mean, it just happened this morning, so. Well, I hope he loves you. Yeah, yeah. He just might. You know, that's all... That's all thanks to you. I mean, you've helped me find my spark for performing. That's great. Uh... I'm confused here. Is something wrong? Uh, somehow... I actually thought for a second that you were making this about us. Yeah... I mean, it is, Sara. I'm not the one who needs music to come back to life again. It's you. Yeah, you work, you have success... but joy? I only see that in you when we're rehearsing together. Look, I care about you, Sara. Deeply. But what happened to love in your life after we split, hmm? That's so melodramatic. Melodramatic or not, look, I invited my agent tomorrow night because what happens at that concert... That could lead to a second chance. Okay? For us. And when did you get the impression that that was something that I wanted? Or that it was your decision to make for the both of us? I already have a career. I know. And you're great at it, from what I hear, but how does it make you feel? There are people counting on me, and most of those people think th-that I am on track to make partner. Is that what you want? I'm not throwing away a decade of my life! I am a good lawyer, and I just need to get back to New York... because I know that I can find happiness there if I just work harder at it. Listen to yourself! You shouldn't have to work to find happiness! Sara, come on. I, um, I do have one favor to ask... that you sing my mom's song solo. W-What? I'll accompany you on piano, or whatever, but give your agent to see you, the new you. Come on, this has never been about my agent, Sara... He's already my agent. Look. I'm done fighting for you, okay? That's it. Good. Good. Then we are on the same page. So you sing and I'll play, and my mom will be overjoyed and... that works out better anyway, because I have a lot left to do for her move before I go back to New York. Thanks, Josh. For everything. What's the matter, honey? Something happen with Josh? Um... we have parted ways. Is that something you wanted? Uh... Man. I was over him. Or so I thought. And now, the music, and just being close to him again... I'm a mess. Oh, honey. You know... Your first love never leaves you. All those years ago, I made the hardest decision of my life... and here I am... the same hurt, all over again. Sara, I never meant to interfere with your decision. I'm sorry. I let my own fear get in the way, and I'm so sorry I wasn't a better mother to you. A better mother? Mom... you lost the love of your life, and then you sacrificed the thing that gave you the greatest joy, all to protect me, because you loved me that much. I literally could not have wished for a better mother. And that hard choice all of those years ago? I made it. Just me. You know, I was thinking about something that George said the other day... about how we shouldn't stay shackled to the past. You should listen to him. Mm. Maybe... sometimes... people just need to think with their hearts instead of their heads. Well, I try. I try! But I'm getting mixed signals! Well, maybe it takes a leap of faith. You know? And it's Christmas... what better time, right? Well... I promise you that I will sleep on that tonight... If you will, too. I love you... I love you. Oh! - Ahem. - Sorry. You scared me. My bad. I, uh, I didn't get much sleep. Listen, Josh, I-I didn't get a lot of sleep either. Yesterday... um... I felt like I was falling for you all over again, and it put me right back to where I was when I was 18, and it really freaked me out. Is that a compliment? What if you come with me to New York? For New Year's? Uh... and then what? You follow your lawyer star, I unpack my guitar, and start over in Manhattan from scratch? Uh, I don't know. We just figure it out as we go. I've had an amazing two weeks with you, Sara, you know, coming to believe that nothing's changed between us, no matter the years, but... maybe time gets the last laugh. huh? Hey, Josh? You're needed for sound check. Uh, right. Ahem. I gotta... Yeah. Okay. Anna? George. If the invitation's still open, I would love to go to the concert with you tonight. I was hoping for a quick yes. Yes! Okay.

Besides this show, my greatest joy this Christmas has been reuniting with a special person in my life. Tonight would not have happened without the help of Sara Thompson, which leads us to our final number of the evening. We have chosen something very personal to Sara and her family. Josh... is going to be singing... a song written by my dad, though not performed, for this very concert... Nearly three decades ago. This one's for you, Mom. Love you! Actually, you know... Hang on a second. I-I'm not sure I've conveyed how important Sara's been to this concert. Or to me. She deserves more than just an acknowledgment. Much more. So... ladies and gentlemen, I give you the lovely, the talented... Anna Thompson! I haven't done this in a very long time, because I was afraid... of a lot of things. But somebody told me that... maybe I should take a leap of faith. So here goes. This is a song by Mike Thompson. He wrote it as a gift to me.

Come on, you guys. You were incredible, Ellie. That was so much fun! Oh, look. Mom and Dad. You're looking for my mom? - Yeah. - This way. - You were amazing. - Thanks! Mom, look who I found. Oh! Hi. Well, some date I turned out to be, huh? Oh, so it was a date? Wasn't she great? I just got the whole story! She was up all night, rehearsing with Josh. Well, Josh didn't call and ask me to sing until after Sara went to bed. And then, well, he still had to do the arrangements and print the programs... He was up all night. That must be his agent. Oh, no. That's just a friend. Josh called off his agent once he convinced Anna to sing. Actually, George, you should come meet the guy. He needs someone to renovate a new duplex he bought. Come on. Go meet the guy. Come on. You are very good at keeping secrets. Well, that was Josh's idea. He wanted this moment to be as memorable for you as it was for me. I didn't think anyone would get you to sing again. Hmm. Neither did I. But Josh... and George... sometimes, you're lucky enough to find people who care enough about you to show you what you've been blind to all along. Sweetheart. I never want you to stop dreaming. Come here. What a night! Wouldn't that be pretty in the bay window at the condo? Absolutely. What better way to celebrate Christmas in your new home? Our new home! Time to make some new traditions. All right. Anything else you want me to take? Well, if there's enough room, you could take me. Oh! Just happen to have a space. Right next to me. - Goodnight, sweetheart. - Goodnight. You were glowing tonight. Likewise. It almost felt like old times, huh? We're timeless. Yeah, well. And here I thought you could manage anything. Story of a producer's life, right? Make a clean sweep and start all over. Mm. Speaking of "start over"... I've been thinking about that. It has its advantages. Yeah. And I'm licensed to practice law in four states, so I could pretty much do that from anywhere. But music... I can only want do that in one place... with one person. Really? Just a day ago, you were off to a big law firm gala in New York for New Year's. My plans changed. Don't you ever want to make partner? I already have a partner. And I already have a ticket to New York. ♪ I'll be coming home ♪ I'll be there for Christmas ♪ Christmas, baby ♪ So keep the light on... ♪ Keep the light on for me ♪ It's Christmas, baby... - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. ♪ ...Don't matter how long ♪ I'll do whatever it takes to reach you ♪ ♪ So light the fire ♪ 'Cause I'll be home tonight ♪ It's Christmas, baby
