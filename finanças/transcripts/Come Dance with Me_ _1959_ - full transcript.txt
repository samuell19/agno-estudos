Hello? Just a moment, please. - Five thousand more. - I'll see you. someone would like to speak to Professor Herve Dandieu. Two pairs of aces. Yes? No, it's impossible at this time of day, miss. Had you been a client... Tell him it's for me. Yes, I'll tell him. It's for Mr. Decauville-Lachenet. Decauville-Lachenet? Don't know him. I beg you, Mr. Dandieu. My father seems to be in such pain. You know what it's like to have a toothache. Make an effort. Be nice. Oh, very well, come by. 15,000 more. Okay. All I have and I'll see you. Color! son of a bitch! You got me! Hey wait! Allow me! Four flush. Just a moment, kids. I'll be right back. Just a moment. Would you step into my office? Thank you. Open your mouth. I think it must be a large cavity. Dad's nerve must be affected which would explain. Does dentistry interest you? Yes, very much. What are you saying, Virginie? It's the first time you've been to a dentist. It's no surprise. Your daughter has magnificent teeth. Do you think so? And they go so well with your mouth. And everything else, too. You should have come much sooner, sir. Your tooth is in such bad shape. Don't stay here, Virginie. I hate it when people look into my mouth. Go away. As for you, my young friend, I didn't wait for you to be treated. My dentist is Professor Godard. This type of bridge isn't done much nowadays. Well, I'm delighted by his services. Open your mouth. Anyway, we have to pull a tooth. Pull a tooth! I don't want to. You won't feel a thing. It's the only way. I forbid you to touch anything. All I ask is that you kill the pain, until tomorrow. I can knock you out with a painkiller. It's easy. If I were you, Dad, I'd trust Dr. Dandieu. He seems to know his work very well. Be quiet, Virginie. As for you, young man, I want you to know... that my daughter is engaged to a man that I entirely approve of. Therefore, there's no hope for you. - What are you going to do to me? - I'll prepare a dressing. I can't stand the drill. I assure you it won't take long. And if you move, I could hurt you badly. Open your mouth. It's true that you are engaged? It's true. Just imagine. I had four sevens. I give up like a fool. And this bum shows me two pairs! Listen, something wonderful is happening to me. What? I've just met the love of my life. - Come on. - Yes. she's here in my office. What an adventure. One can't say you were lucky when you chose this dentist. - A party-goer and an alcoholic. - Not at all! You didn't notice? He reeks of alcohol. To top it off, I don't like his physique. He looks like an apprentice butcher. A beef handler. Yes, that's it! A beef handler. Well, I find him great. Are you crazy? He's exactly the kind of man I need. Come on, Albert, don't make such a face. My son-in-law looks like an apprentice butcher. And you look like a monkey. Make an effort. At least congratulate him. Well, it's done. Right? I hope you will make her happy. A spoiled child! That's what you are. You're impossible. You meddle with everything but you don't know a thing! All this because you managed to get a little diploma. I could've had one too, if I wanted! Go right ahead. Get the exams and leave me alone! And if you're so interested in dentistry, tell your father to set up a practice for you. That way you'll have your patients and you won't take care of mine anymore! Dentistry never interested me, my poor friend. First, it's a minor profession. - What are you doing? - I'm leaving. I won't stay a minute longer with a hooligan like you. Listen Virginie, if you pass this door, we are through. Good riddance! I don't need a pain in the neck like you. Your upbringing is showing. You meddler! Bad dentist. sir, dinner is served. I will not dine in. You come here often, madam? My name is Anita. You come here often, Anita? Very often. One can meet very nice people sometimes. Are you married? Yes, with a wonderful woman, fantastic. I wonder how she even became interested in me. Why isn't she with you tonight? We had an argument. A silly argument, you know. - Like all arguments. - Exactly. Let's dance. It will change your mind. I am married, too. Do you like your husband? He's a failure and a jackass. It's amazing how well you dance. I'm a dance teacher. The Anita Flores Dance studio, that's me. You must think I'm a bad dancer. You could use a few classes. You should come and see us. Good evening, Mr. Decauville-Lachenet. - How are you? - Very well. Do you have my table? Oh, my God! What's the matter? My father-in-law. If he sees me with you, I'm done. I've never even cheated on my wife. Just my luck. Particularly since we're not doing anything wrong. You don't know my father-in-law. He hates me. - Do you think he saw us? - No, I'm almost completely hiding you. Come on. Give me back my keys. I'll give them back if you come up for one last drink. When you have an idea in mind...! You don't say. Okay. I'm coming up for only five minutes. I will have warned you. Five minutes, promised. Please excuse me, I made myself comfortable. Listen, you must be sleepy. I'll run along. Not at all. Let's talk another few minutes. I'm not sleepy at all. You smell very nice. Do you feel okay? I feel quite well myself. My darling. My darling. Don't you like me? Yes, a lot. If I'd met you a few months ago, maybe... As I told you, I adore my wife. It may seem silly, but I've never cheated on her. A faithful husband is very touching. Your wife trust you, you trust her. If she learned that you had cheated, especially with someone like me... it wouldn't be the same, right? Maybe, I don't know. Have you been married long? Three months. Well, go away, bad boy. Thank you for your hospitality. Thanks to you I've had a very pleasant evening. - Goodbye. - Good night. How are the pictures? A couple of them might be amusing. The one where you breast-fed him, for instance. You didn't get much tonight, my little Leon. Who is this guy? A newlywed, a dentist. stupid. With a loaded father-in-law. It might be interesting. Oh, you scared me. Where were you? And don't tell me you spent the evening with your parents. - Why, did you call them? - No. - What time is it? - 3..30. It's crazy. so you don't want to tell me where you spent the evening? How about you? Where did you go? I didn't go out. Poor little Herve. How he must have been bored by himself. He was very naughty with his little wife. Don't try and change the subject. I asked you a question, so answer me. If I tell you where I went, you'll be furious. I went to the sexy Club. Where you wouldn't take me. What? You can't imagine the raunchy strip-teases! And all the overly-excited men yelling... it was something. You dared going alone to such a place! Would you have preferred that I go with someone? Are you mad? I promise never to go out without you again. Come to bed. I'm terribly sleepy. Is that true? Of course not. Where are you going now? To the bathroom, to brush my hair. Is it really necessary? No. Do you love me? Yes. Am I the only one you love? You're the only one. We won't argue again. Never again, I swear. I was unhappy the entire evening, you know. Me too. I was thinking of you the whole time I was watching the strip-tease. I adore you. What are you doing? I'm looking at you. I find you very handsome. When I think that all this is mine... all mine. You see, my dear... if men were to do strip-tease, you would certainly be a big star. You're silly, my dear. Come here, my love. It's true, you know. We are forever admiring women's bodies. but I find men's bodies much more appetizing. Don't you? You see, for me, it's rather the contrary. Is it true? Do you find me appetizing? You haven't realized that yet? It's amazing how life's well made. There! You see I didn't hurt you. Over here. The next person. Check out your next patient. Quite a pin-up! Good morning, Doctor. It's Mrs. Vita. Will her fixture be ready on Monday? Yes, have her come. I'll take care of it. It's my wife. she is lovely. Obviously, she doesn't know we went out together. Listen, madam, I'm flattered you came to see me, but if you need a dentist, I can recommend a good one. That won't be necessary. I don't have a toothache. I came to show you something. something that will surely interest you. Virginie, could you get this lady's files? she's an old patient. It is Mrs...? Mrs. Flores. Anita Flores. You slut! If you think I'll fall for your dirty tricks, you're wrong! I advise you to use another tone of voice with me. Unless you want me to give these pretty pictures to your wife. Or to your father-in-law, maybe? I'm sure Mr. Decauville-Lachenet would greatly appreciate them. I'll wait for you tomorrow at my dance studio. We'll find it quieter to discuss our little business. Do you remember, Mr. Dandieu, I promised to give you some lessons. I looked everywhere. I can't find the file. Where is your patient? she's already gone? Yes. she's some sort of lunatic. she doesn't even have a toothache. I don't know why she came. My poor darling, you should see your face. It's funny. Yeah? Listen, Virginie. Bring in the next patient. I'd rather die than bring you this money. You won't get a dime! You really want to create a scandal. You filth bag! Give me back these pictures. Give them back right away! You hear me? One, two, mambo. Don't you think we should intervene? It's only a small argument. - Mr. Flores. - What is it? Your wife seems to be having difficulties with her client. Maybe we should check it out. I never interfere with my wife's business. You can check it out. A scumbag. Give them back to me! What's going on? There's some trouble with the boss. I don't have them with me, I swear. Can I help, madam? Next time, I promise, I'll really punch you out. You know no one's allowed in my studio when I'm teaching. Yes madam, but we thought... As for you, Daisy, there's no need to be zealous. Anyway, you'll leave the studio at the end of the month. Did you have Mrs. Leclerc at 6..00 p.m.? No. she called to say she couldn't come. When did she call? Around 5..00 p.m. Perfect. You will charge her for a lesson. she should have canceled sooner. Very well, madam. It bothers you that Dad's coming for dinner. No, dear, it's fine. Do you love me? Yes. Am I the only one you love? Yes, only you. It's for you, Herve. It's Anita Flores. Anita Flores? Isn't that your patient from the other day? Yes. I'll take the call in my office. Be sweet and go keep your father company. I'm coming. Good evening, Mr. Dandieu. I hope you're in a better mood tonight. I had asked you not to call me at home anymore. Just what I thought. Your husband has a mistress. It's not true. I'll expect you at 7.:30 tomorrow. After the dance classes we'll be able to talk in peace. I'm becoming wary of your volcanic temper, Mr. Dandieu. see you tomorrow, Mr. Dandieu. I'm counting on you. What do you think? We could ask him to explain this mysterious date. This is my business. I'll take care of it alone. Goodbye, Mr. Flores. Good night. I may be a little late. I still have to give a lesson. Oh, it's you. Just a second. see you later, my love. Kisses. Yes, I love you. I'm leaving. I wanted to know if you're dining at home. No, I'll dine out. Very well. Come in. Oh, it's you, Daniel. I bet you've come to ask for money. Your timing is bad. I'm waiting for someone. - Did you bring your dance lesson slips? - Yes, madam. Here, hang this sign before you leave. WANTED, FEMALE DANCE TEACHER I'm counting on you. Hey, what's wrong? Didn't she want to pay your overtime? Getting money out of this one! Oh well, I'll go on the offensive again tomorrow. - lsn't that the guy from yesterday? - Yes, that's him. - should we stop him from going up? - Yes, go ahead. What can we do for you, sir? I have an appointment with Anita Flores. Very well. I'll let her know you're here. Mrs. Flores, there's a gentleman who claims to have an appointment with you. Okay. I'll send him up, but I thought... It's the same person who came yesterday. Very well, madam. Mrs. Flores is expecting you. - What are you doing here? - What are you? What are you doing with this gun? Where's your mistress, Anita Flores? The poor Anita Flores was never my mistress, I swear. so, can you explain what you're doing here? I came for a dance lesson. You thought I danced badly, so I wanted to surprise you. This is a bad time for questions. I have enough problems as it is. - Help! Murder! - Be quiet! You can give the keys to Mrs. Flores for her to close. Very well. You killed her. Mrs. Flores, I'm leaving. I'll leave the keys on the table. Good night, Mrs. Anita. Don't trouble yourself. see you tomorrow. He left. We're saved. Let's wait a few minutes, then we'll leave. I'm in a terrible situation. I swear I didn't kill this woman. she was already dead when I walked in. I found her by the phone. she must have been killed a few seconds before I came in. You don't believe me? Of course, I believe you, my dear. What I don't understand is that I kept watching the door... and no one else besides you walked in the studio. There may be another door. Go and see. There is no other door. You must admit it's extraordinary. I don't understand, either. It's the mystery of the yellow bedroom. No one came in, no one went out. Unless... he went out the window. It's the only explanation. There is no window. Why are you looking at me like that? I told you I didn't kill her. Quick, hurry. The murderer is still in the house! - What's going on? - There was a murder at Flores'. Yes, the Flores studio. 10 Foire street, near the park. Come on, we can't stay here. Over there, quick. Who could have foreseen such a thing? I'm shattered... shattered. - All the pictures were taken? - Yes, lnspector. Good. You can remove the body. - Goodbye, lnspector. - Goodbye, Doctor. It's okay, you can go. Inspector, some students came. should I send them away? Do as you wish. It's none of my concern. What do we do? Personally, I feel incapable of giving a lesson today. Can you imagine dancing under such conditions? But since the students came, go ahead. Courage! Miss, I have to leave. I have an appointment. The doctor is busy with a patient, but he'll see you right away. You say you didn't kill her. I want to believe you. - But still. - Dad, please! He has enough troubles. How could you get yourself into such a situation? You should never have gone to that nightclub. It's all my fault. If we hadn't argued, he wouldn't have met this horrible woman. You're mad! They're going to arrest you any minute now. What are you saying? Herve's description is in every paper. - It's impossible. - But of course. "The assassin: a male between 30 and 35, athletic... with blue eyes, brown hair, a very handsome man... wearing a gray suit, eluded the police by escaping over the roof." That's extraordinary. - What? - We left through the garden. Virginie is right. The one who escaped over the roof must be the killer. Well, the mystery of the yellow bedroom is solved. The assassin shot her from the vent in the ceiling. To think that the police will go on the wrong trail sickens me. We must definitely do something. Perfect! You've got the tango. Now let's see the other dances. It's funny, this vent. Oh, you think so? It's an air vent. There is one in every studio. Is it easy to clean? I beg your pardon? I'm saying... it must not be easy to clean. How do you get to them? I don't know. I've never thought about it. This mambo is very catchy. The students love it. You have a very special technique. Really? I didn't know that step. I'm just doing anything, you know. Oh, what beautiful hair! such legs! such a waist! This lady came for the teacher's position. I think we can take her on a trial basis. I think it's an excellent idea. What is your name, miss? Fernande. Working doesn't frighten you, Fernande? Oh no, on the contrary. I love to dance. Well, congratulations. You'll have plenty of chances. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. No, one, two, three, four... together. - I'll never get it. - Yes, you will. One, two, three, four... It's not bad for a first lesson. Practice alone in front of the mirror, I'll keep an eye on you. Go on, continue. After you, lnspector. - Good morning, lnspector. - Don't let us interrupt you, miss. We took down all the names. None of these men match the description. The guy we're looking for is not from the studio. No, probably not, but... Who's this young lady? she's the new dance teacher. Why didn't we question her? she was hired this morning. she came from out of town. I've asked for an office on the main floor. It'll be quieter. sorry to have troubled you. You didn't trouble me at all, lnspector. Miss. I think you scored a point, boss. The kid was all eyes for you. Really? I didn't notice anything. I love the be-bop, don't you? Yes, yes. shall we do it again? We still have 15 minutes. - Aren't you a little tired? - No, not at all. Rest for a minute anyway. I'll be right back. Where are you going? Is your lesson over already? No, there's still 15 minutes to go. Then go back to your studio. I haven't stopped since this morning. You have the lunch hour to rest. Go back to work. Ah, there you are. You seem rather nervous today, Doctor. Dentists have their problems like everyone else. It's madam, sir. Will you excuse me? Hello, Virginie, where are you? I'm at Anita Flores' studio. I got myself hired as a teacher. This is crazy. Come home right away! Please, Herve, don't shout like that. You think it's fun being here? I haven't stopped dancing all day. My feet are killing me. I'm almost certain now that the killer fired through the vent. I'll call you later. Virginie, Virginie! It's no laughing matter, madam. Is that you, boss? Yes, Joseph, I'm here. so, how was the little walk on the roof? Unfortunately, there's nothing new about this. After he was surprised by the bartender, our killer made it to the street using the service staircase next door. Funny place, isn't it? The bartender said Mr. Flores used to come here to watch the girls take showers. He must have had fun. There are a lot of cuties here. This is where he watched? Yes, but it's not relevant to our investigation. Come on. - Did you talk to the inspector? - No. You should, you know. How else can we find him? And we won't have any peace until we do. No, no. If I talk to the inspector, he'll know my wife advised me, and I really don't want that. I have a better idea. Look. MR. INsPECTOR MARCHAL An anonymous letter. That way the inspector will know the name of the man he's after. It's an excellent idea. Give it to me. The inspector went out for lunch. I'll place it on his desk. He'll have it when he returns. What do we risk? Excuse me, lnspector. I took over your office. I was told you had gone to lunch. I didn't think you'd be back so soon. Excuse me. Did you know that it's very bad? - What is very bad? - Eating too fast. I know, but in our profession, we are always so rushed. Are you married, Mr. Inspector? I'm a widower. A widower? Did you lose something, lnspector? Yes, my glasses. I'm almost certain I left them on this desk. Oh, your glasses... Here they are. It's amazing how impressive you look with your glasses. It changed you completely. It makes you look much more serious. You see, if I had met you in the street like that, I never would have guessed what you did for work. I imagined police inspectors totally differently. A lot older, first of all, and a lot less seductive. I would have liked to be a police inspector. Really? You know, I read a lot of murder mysteries, and I can also guess who the killer is. Come in. Do you need me anymore, lnspector? I'm leaving. Actually, yes. I'll need you later. Oh no... since I'm off, I was going to rehearse at the Blue Fetish. You'll rehearse later. I won't keep you long. You sent for me, lnspector? Yes, sit down. I'll take care of you right away. I'll send for you later. I must ask you to leave this office now. Me, too? You, too. so, Mr. Flores, still in the same frame of mind? What do you mean? I don't understand. You said this morning that you knew almost nothing about... the extra-curricular affairs of your wife. You probably also didn't know she was a blackmailer. A blackmailer? It's impossible, lnspector. I never heard about this. I'm starting to get fed-up with all these cops. Did you notice how unpleasant the inspector was with me? Of course I noticed. Want to know something? I think the inspector believes you're the one. The murderer. Come on. Everybody knows who the murderer is. The guy who had an appointment with her that night. The one who had come the night before. Well, that's the point. It's not him. I hear it's a false lead. But don't tell the inspector I told you. That's incredible. Are you sure about this? Absolutely sure. Believe me, I'm in a good position to know. Oh, really? The inspector told me, okay. The killer shot Anita through the air vent in the room. Unbelievable. And you think the inspector suspects me? No, in reality, he suspects everyone. You, Mr. Flores, Daisy... the bartender. The bartender, it's ridiculous... He's the one that called the police. so, what does that prove? since I'm telling you, this is all a set-up. I understand the inspector might suspect Daisy or Mr. Flores. - They had a reason to kill her. - Oh, really? I don't know, actually. I'm guessing. But I had none. I wasn't her lover or her heir. Besides, I know why the inspector suspects me. Why? Because of my morals. What are your morals? And don't tell me you hadn't noticed. I swear, I hadn't noticed a thing. Well, that's the way it is. I don't like women. - Not at all? - No, I really don't. Take you, for instance. I find you very pretty and friendly. But, I don't feel any desire to kiss you. I would have to force myself. - I hope I didn't hurt your feelings? - Not at all. I can understand one wouldn't want to kiss me. Everyone is free to do as they please, right? That's not the inspector's opinion. You should've seen his face when I told him I worked at the Blue Fetish. What is that, the Blue Fetish? A nightclub of a very bad sort. Not at all for young ladies. How fun it must be! It's you who are fun. Go on, go on. No, I don't want to. It would be pure madness to go there. Let's go home and wait for Virginie to return. I'm telling you, you're not in any danger. You've never been to this dance school. Therefore, these people won't know who you are. All you have to do is take a lesson. If you think I feel like dancing right now... You've put my daughter and me in an impossible situation. If I was told you did kill that woman, I wouldn't be surprised. You could've had the decency to leave me out of this. We certainly intended to, Virginie and l. We knew if we were in trouble we couldn't count on you. Do you know it's forbidden to double park? Do you have your driver's license? Excuse me, Mr. Flores, the boss would like to see you in his office. Try and dance together. Tell the inspector, I can't keep interrupting my lessons. No kidding? I'm coming right away. Well, this is it. He found our man. I'm impossible. It's true. They took him to the inspector's office. As soon as we identify him, it'll be over. Continue the lesson without me. I'll be right back. You will examine him closely before answering. I remind you that it's a murder. Your accusations will be extremely serious for him. You can bring him in, Joseph. I would like to know what this is about, lnspector. The cops picked me up in Orly. I didn't have time to change. Can you remove your hat, please? - so? - No, lnspector, it isn't him. - And you? - No, it's not him. And you, Mr. Flores, you don't recognize him either? No, lnspector. It's the first time I've seen this gentleman. Okay. You can leave. I don't need you anymore. No, you stay. I have some questions for you. Don't think you'll get away with it so easily. Not being identified doesn't prove you're innocent. Far from it. I don't understand a thing you're saying, but I find you absolutely charming. What are you doing here? I'd like to say a word to you, lnspector. Mr. Flores is looking for you everywhere. Apparently you left your class without telling him. I haven't stopped dancing all morning. I'd like to see you switch places with me. My human resistance has its limits. Very well, go wait for me next door. sorry to have kept you so long. But considering the rather special relationship... Considering your special relationship with the victim, we wanted to verify your alibi. My relationship with the victim? I saw this woman three times in my life. Even then, it's because I was obliged to. I always found Mrs. Flores very unpleasant. That's partly why we called you in. It's lucky I was on the New York plane at the time of the murder, or you probably would have arrested me. We don't arrest people so easily, rest assured. Goodbye, Miss. This mambo is very slow. For a beginner like you, it will be easier. Oh no, sir. You must concentrate a little if you want to learn how to dance. One really wonders why you came for a class. You don't even listen to my instructions. Then you'll be surprised not to have made any progress. We are going to do the mambo again. The weight of the body on one foot... then the other. Don't be afraid to exaggerate the hip movement. We can tone it down later. No, look. Ah, finally! Not a moment too soon. You're finally here, Miss. I thought I told you not to leave your studio. I had to teach this gentleman for you. I'm sorry, Miss. If you want, I can continue the lesson. Unless it disturbs the gentleman. At this point, it doesn't matter if I change teachers. Yes, I would actually prefer to change. Well, I see, perfect. Whatever you want, sir. Let's continue, sir. You're crazy to have come here. It's your stupid husband who made me. You don't know what shape he's in. He definitely wants you to come home. I'm not leaving until I discover who the killer is. What you're telling me is incredible! - That young lady is back in her studio? - Yes, lnspector, she is. It's insane! I never said your wife's mysterious visitor wasn't the killer. But I also never told anyone I suspected you or the other dance teachers. As for suspecting the bartender, it's absolutely ridiculous. I'd rather tell you, lnspector. This story about the air vent... it's surprising. surprising, indeed. It's not your husband's name in this letter. What? The assassin is Gerard Lalemand... 59 Avenue of Versailles. How about that? Do you think this Mr. Lalemand could be the killer? Could you come in, Miss? I need to talk to you. Get ready for this, lnspector. I have big news for you. This time, I think we've got him! Come over here. I feel like we're being watched. Listen, Miss-- Hello. Listen to me carefully, lnspector. The killer is a certain Gerard Lalemand. He lives at 59 Avenue of Versailles. What do you think? Listen, Miss, I've been extremely patient with you, but now it's over. And I thought you were nice, lnspector. If only what you said made sense! But you keep saying foolish things. Oh, really? You insist that Mrs. Flores' killer was not the man next to her in the studio. Precisely, lnspector. The killer fired through the air vent. shall I show you how he did it? I see she also told you her version of the murder. This young lady will drive us all crazy. I was looking at this. It's another theory. Maybe, but all the test proved that the shot was fired at point blank. Therefore, the assassin had to be in this room. Are you sure about that? Absolutely, Miss. Our experts are never wrong. so it's the mystery of the yellow bedroom. No, Miss. There's no mystery of the yellow bedroom in this murder. she's terrible. she wants to create mystery where there's none. Ah, there you are! Virginie isn't with you? No, Doctor. I've been waiting for an hour. I should go before this gentleman! - It's an emergency. - For me, too! sir, I'm the father-in-law. I owe you no explanation! Go back to the waiting room! - We'll call you! - Well. But where is Virginie? she's still at the dance studio. she couldn't be swayed. she wanted to stay there. One really can't ask you for anything. That does it! You don't realize the risks I took by going there! I had to dance slows and mambos for over an hour. A man of my age! Under the sharp stares of the police inspector who took me for a dirty old man. Tell the doctor I'll never set foot here again! I had a 4:00 appointment. 4:00! You know how determined Virginie is. she would do anything to prove your innocence. she had discovered a small closet, used for storing records. But this closet was so small. Virginie was forced to admit that the killer couldn't hide in it. What are you doing? Leave me alone! Help! Help! someone help! Let me go! Why are you shouting? - I didn't hurt you! - I don't want to go in the closet. You're crazy, Miss. Look what you've done! - You're a nasty tattle-tale! - she tried to push me-- A nasty tattle-tale, that's what you are! Enough, Miss! We've had it with your extravagance. We took you on a trial basis. It hasn't worked out. - Are you sure of that? - The witness is positive. - lnterrogate him yourself. - He must be mistaken, it's impossible. I assure you, boss, the two descriptions don't match. The one who escaped by the roof is not the same one... that was seen at the dance studio. Instead of looking for one, we'll be looking for two. Perfect! Go and fetch the new dance teacher for me. - Who? The pin-up? - Yes, the 'pin-up' as you say. I have some questions for her. I think this young lady took me for a fool. Do you think so, lnspector? she's so cute. she charmed you, too? We chatted a little. Nothing more. The young lady just left, boss. What? - she didn't leave. It's impossible. - I fired her. she was never at her position. students were complaining. Fortunately, it can't be too difficult to find her. - What's her name? - I don't know, lnspector. she told me her name was Fernande. That's all I know. How can that be? You hire people without knowing their names? It's unthinkable! I hired her on a trial basis. If she had been permanent, I would've asked her name. The first name she gave you must be fake. she doesn't look like a Fernande. The little bitch. she got us good. THE KlLLER Is GERARD LALEMAND Is this the residence of Gerard Lalemand? Yes, this is he. I'm calling on behalf of Anita Flores. On behalf of Anita Flores. Yes, I heard. On behalf of Anita Flores. I have a big revelation for you regarding this murder, Mr. Lalemand. I would rather we see each other. Whenever you want. I'd tell you to come to my place, but... In a cafe, we would be quieter. Thank you, Clemence. Don't forget to close the door, there's quite a draft. Very well, sir. Would you like to meet at the Versailles Bar in half an hour? It's close to your place. In a half hour? I'll be there. Tell me what you look like so I can recognize you. I have blue eyes, my hair is white, and I have a crew cut. Okay, I will certainly recognize you. Let's say 9:30 sharp at the Versailles Bar. see you later. I forbid you to go to that appointment. You could have wiped your feet. You got everything wet. I have a bad feeling, Virginie. Don't go to that appointment. I risk absolutely nothing, I swear. After all, this man doesn't know me. No, you're not going to wear this dress. Yes, I am. I know you don't like it. It doesn't matter, I love it. It is grotesque, unwearable, and indecent beyond limits. One more reason to wear it today. Because you absolutely want this man to see your chest. Under such circumstances, it might not hurt him. You should go out naked while you're at it. I'd like that. When I'm naked, I lose all my complexes. You can't understand this. You're not a woman. It's not so easy to be a woman, you know. Men are so much stronger than us. so we must fight with whatever little means we have. Yours are not so little, you know, dear. Help me. Hello, Mr. Dandieu? - I'd like to see you. - What about? I was an intimate friend of poor Anita. It was 500,000 you were going to give her the other night to recover your pictures. You didn't pay. You were wrong because now the police are looking for you, and the prices will go up. Go to hell, mister! Tell the police, I don't care. I'm not the one who killed Anita Flores! If I were you, Mr. Dandieu, I think-- Go on, my little friend, this is all very interesting. You were the one on the roof the night of the murder. Don't try and lie to us. Witnesses saw you. I didn't kill her, I swear. Be careful what you're about to say. Your little blackmail scheme will cost you plenty already. It's that Mr. Dandieu. I didn't do anything. How are you so sure that it's him? Because I was there. I knew Anita was meeting him at 7.:30 to get the money. Every time, she tried to scam me out of my commission. so, I hid above her studio to see the money exchange. For once, I must say, Anita had an unlucky draw. When I walked in, the dentist had already done her in. He was cleaning his gun. And you didn't think of yelling of doing something? I'm telling you she was dead when I arrived. What good would yelling have done? I understood that I screwed up by hiding above, and I split in a hurry. Later, you thought of taking advantage of the situation? I just wanted to take some money from him. In jail you won't need it. All expenses will be paid. It's you! You gave me such a scare. Take off your glasses, people will notice you. I get the impression your guy isn't coming anymore. Things are going real bad, Virginie. some guy called me and wants to accuse me. It's unreal! so I was able to impress him by telling him to go ahead. It seemed to work. He hung up right away. But still, I don't feel reassured, you know. Was someone here supposed to meet a Lalemand? A Mr. Lalemand? Yes, it's me. This gentleman says he won't be able to come. That's all? He didn't leave a message? - No, ma'am. - Thank you. It's funny, isn't it? I was sure he wouldn't come. I'm sorry it took so long to open the door. When I'm alone in the apartment, I always lock up. Oh, what a nice portrait. I recognized it right away. It's of Mr. Lalemand, right? Yes. I served Mr. Lalemand for over 40 years, Miss. I had an appointment with Mr. Lalemand earlier, but unfortunately, he couldn't come. Why are you looking at me like that? Because... What you've just said is impossible, Miss. Why is it impossible? Because Mr. Lalemand is dead, Miss. He's been dead three years. I assure you ma'am, I don't understand. I called him earlier to make an appointment. You must have talked to Mr. Gerard. Mr. Gerard is the son of that poor man. His son? Then why did he give me the description of this portrait? That's the way Mr. Gerard is. He doesn't respect anything. Not even the memory of his father. I don't know Mr. Gerard, but he doesn't seem to like you very much. He would like to see me dead. I know a lot of things. Too many things. Yes, I was told he wanted to part with you. And since I was looking for a position... Look elsewhere, believe me. Mr. Gerard is a scoundrel. Now that he's about to become rich, he's trying to get rid of me. He's about to become rich? He's going to collect an inheritance of 50 million. That's all I know. He won't need to work anymore. For what he was doing! He changed jobs all the time. He even changed names. Really? Mr. Gerard once decided to get into theater. Mr. Gerard dances very well, I hear. In reality, all those dance and theater groups were excuses... to mingle with boys of his type. Boys with the same morals as him. If you know what I mean. Very well. I would like to know if... Excuse me for a second. Yes, sir. Precisely. The young lady who should replace me is here. I would've preferred to be told directly if I know longer suited you. How's that? But-- but this young lady told me... No, sir, no. Yes, yes. Go away! You lied to me. You tried to make me talk. Go away, I'm not-- I beg you, ma'am. It's very serious. It's about the murder of Anita Flores. Anita Flores? she's dead? she's dead! Go away! Go away! she's dead! Anita Flores! Go away. Hello, Mr. Flores? I'd like some information, it's for lnspector Marchal. - I'm the deputy. - Yes, Mr. Deputy. I wanted to ask you... Do you know a certain Gerard Lalemand? No, Mr. Deputy. I don't know him. Come on, Mr. Flores. You and your mistress Daisy sent us an anonymous letter this afternoon. The police are well informed, Mr. Flores. It's true, I accused Mr. Lalemand. But I didn't know him. My wife told me about him several times. I thought for a while he was the killer, but I was wrong. I only wanted to help the police. You knew this Gerard Lalemand, but... he may have worked under another name at the dance studio. The name Daniel, for instance. What are you saying? It can't be the police, be careful. What does that mean? He hung up. Police. Mr. Dandieu, please. There's no one here. Mister and Madam are out. The little slut. she really got us. What are you doing here? I'm the father-in-law of Mr. Dandieu. Is that so? I see that you work together as a family. Leave us, Mathilde. Inspector, I'm delighted you came. - Really? - I couldn't take it anymore. In fact, I had decided to come and see you. You should have, Mister...? Decauville-Lachenet, industrialist. Be keeping quiet, you've put yourself in a very bad position. A scotch, please. Thank you. Why are you here, Mrs. Dandieu? You don't impress me, you know. What expression would you make... if I told the inspector that you stole from my purse today? I beg you, don't say anything. I'm married with three children. Ladies and gentlemen, good evening. Welcome to the Blue Fetish. Do you know a certain Gerard Lalemand? You know him? I never heard that name. He's Anita Flores' killer. The charming Danielle. You're making my head spin My merry-go-round, it's you For me, it's always a feast... It's him, Daniel? Yes. He's doing a transvestite show. If I were to go around the world, It wouldn't spin anymore than this The earth is not round enough To make me a dizzy as you do Daniel is not his real name. His name is Gerard Lalemand. What a life we both have When one loves like we do We could change planets As long as my heart is near yours I hear the carnival's music And the earth is not responsible Well, Mathilde, you're not in bed yet? You look upset. What's the matter? Your father-in-law is in the living room. Excuse me, Albert. I didn't know you were coming. I have to talk to you, Herve. It's extremely important. - Where's Virginie? - At the Blue Fetish. - At the Blue Fetish? - That's correct. As she learned that a Gerard Lalemand didn't like women, she concluded he must have killed Anita Flores. Please, don't try to understand. say, Albert, you don't look well. Forget all this, and go to bed. I have very bad news for you. Go ahead, I'm immune to it. Here it is. There is a witness to the murder of Anita Flores. What are you saying? A witness who was there and saw everything. And this witness saw the murderer kill Anita Flores? Yes. And you call this bad news! You silly oaf. What you're saying is miraculous! I'm giddy with joy. They'll finally know who did it. I'll be proven innocent. I have to kiss you for the good news. I adore you, Albert. I adore you. - Who are you, sir? - lnspector Marchal. son of a bitch! You sold me out. You're very unfair, Mr. Dandieu. Your father-in-law went to great lengths to convince me of your innocence. It shouldn't be hard to prove now, if there's a witness. The witness did not attend the crime, unfortunately. We only did this to see your reaction. Your father-in-law had this brilliant idea, as a last resort. I could hardly refuse him that. Albert, you really did this? I always thought you were innocent. The dressing rooms are off limits, Miss. No, let her in. - This lady's a friend of mine. - Very well. Good evening. sit down. Excuse me, I'm getting ready for the next number. - How have you been? - Very well. I'm sorry you didn't come to our appointment. We had an appointment? That's news to me. I called you earlier. You gave me a false description. since then, I went to your place. I saw your housekeeper. I know everything, Mr. Lalemand. - What did you call me? - Gerard Lalemand. I'm sorry, my name's Daniel. I know very well your name's Daniel. Women are decidedly rather complicated. If you know my name's Daniel, why in the hell do you call me Gerard? Because Gerard is your real name. You wanted to do theater, your father didn't want you to, so you had to change names. And you chose Daniel. Listen, Miss, that's crazy. My name's always been Daniel. As for my father, he's an old actor, touring the country, so I didn't need his opinion when I decided to act. If I'm here to give him 10,000 francs occasionally, that's all he wants. Then your father didn't die three years ago? Unfortunately not. I still have to support him. - It's terrible. - And how. Especially since he started drinking lately, which complicates things. Don't worry like that. You'll manage to discover Anita Flores' killer. I'd like to, but I'm starting to have serious doubts. so you're disappointed because I'm not your killer. If I don't find him, my husband will be arrested. Really? And you have reasons to believe this Mr. Lalemand is guilty? And how! You can't imagine what his housekeeper told me. If I were you, I'd try to see this guy by all means. The fact he's trying to flee from you is a rather good sign. At his hour, he might be home. Maybe. I should try, after all. What do I have to lose? But be careful, anyway. Going to see a man at this hour and in that dress... I have nothing to fear there. I heard he doesn't like women. Pardon me. You don't hurt my feelings at all, little one. - Daniel, it's your turn. - Excuse me, I have to go on stage. I was glad to see you. I find you very appealing. It's true, I like you. You see, you might be the first woman to give me regrets. Hands of little women are admirable And all similar To birds They wave their cute and fragile fingers Like sparrows' wings The fine little hand Cuts, sews and knits When she also combs her hair While doing like this Their gestures are always pretty When they play With their fans Or arrange their eye make-up When they play piano or tap their fingers Bravissimo! When on their pretty face They put some rice powder I proclaim women's hands Are jewels I'm crazy about I love the hands of flower shop girls Pretty artists, like fresh bouquets Will he be long? I have several questions for him. No, he's almost done. I like cooks who prepare my food Little succulent dishes That I'm very fond of Because I must admit I am a gourmet It's me again. Is Mr. Lalemand back home? No. Go away. I beg you, go away. What's going on, Clemence? It's that young lady who was already here. Well, let her in. so... you're Gerard Lalemand? I was sorry to miss our appointment this afternoon, but I had to report urgently or Orly. You can go up to bed, Clemence. We won't need you anymore. she's completely mad. You don't know the effect you had on her, when you told her about Anita's death. Your housekeeper was perhaps a relative of Anita Flores? No, not at all. Anita Flores was my father's mistress. Oh? Was Anita Flores already married then? Of course, to this awful pimp Flores. Do you know that Mr. Flores immediately suspected you? It doesn't surprise me coming from him. He never had much imagination. Anita's death suits you, though. You're going to inherit 50 million. These 50 million have been mine for three years. - Really? - Yes. My father, who had principles, would never have disinherited his son in favor of his mistress. so, I'm the one who inherited the 50 million. Anita, while living, was to enjoy the inheritance. You'll say that I must not have cared to have all that dough, and not be able to use it. And I agree entirely. However, I didn't kill her. I probably had all the motives, but I didn't kill her. Why do you seem so nervous? What are you afraid of, Mr. Lalemand? Afraid? What would I be afraid of? Of you, perhaps? You're so pretty. I know you found a trick to get rid of Anita Flores without taking any risks. I'll manage to find your trick. May I answer the telephone? Please. - Is that you, Gerard? - Yes. Why are you calling at such an hour? Things are going very bad. The only thing that could've gone wrong, just did. Really? Your maid spilled the beans. The police will soon realize we know each other. I told you to get rid of that old woman. That old bitch was the only one who could prove we knew each other. Well, no, my little Francoise, this idea did not cross her mind. For a while, I thought like you, but I checked and I assure you all is well. You think so? You're marvelous, Francoise, always worrying for nothing. Relax, relax. I'm telling you life is beautiful, and all is well. But I have someone here. I'll call you later. Bastards! You tricked me. I talked for nothing. The maid didn't say anything. You knew nothing. Bastards! Rest assured, your buddy won't get away with it now. You won't be the only one carrying the blame. That's what you wanted, you scum! I've been had like a dope. And your story about the photographer above the vent who saw everything. You concocted that, too! We had to find something to make you talk. Take him away. You bastards! Gerard, get away! I turned you in! The cops know everything. Get way! Quick, Gerard. You're still here? We're here to see Mr. Lalemand. Where is he? He's there. Take care of him. I hope you didn't kill him. I only knocked him out. I thought I was doing the right thing. He got a phone call when I was here and answered strangely. Yes, my little Francoise. No, my little Francoise. since his maid told me he didn't like women, I found this rather strange. You don't need much to knock people out, do you? I guessed right, though. It was his accomplice on the phone. His accomplice is Daniel. He's the one who killed Anita, so that his boyfriend Gerard would inherit the 50 million. This woman is absolutely crazy, lnspector. The person who called me is Francoise Rancheau. You can verify it, she's a good friend of mine. Tell me, your good friend Francoise was calling from my office. Go and prepare a small bag, we're taking you with us. Escort him, both of you. As for you, Mrs. Dandieu... Yes, lnspector? Now that your husband's innocence has been proven... you don't need to charm me anymore. But I'm not. I just wanted to know how Daniel killed Anita. You still don't understand? No. Think about it for a second, Mrs. Dandieu. When your husband arrived at the dance studio... the assassin was watching out for him through the window. Daniel had been waiting for such an occasion for a long time. Come in. The day before he'd heard your husband threaten Anita in front of witnesses. He also knew Anita had given him an appointment that night at 7.:30. Oh, it's you, Daniel. Daniel only had a few minutes to carry out his plan. A rather clever plan, which would enable him to get rid of Anita, while pointing the finger to someone who had all the motives. Hey, what's wrong? Didn't she want to pay your overtime? Getting money out of this one! Oh, well. I'll go on the offensive again tomorrow. - lsn't that the guy from yesterday? - Yes, that's him. And when your husband arrived, Daniel made a scene to convince the witnesses that Anita was still alive then. Mrs. Flores, there's a gentleman who claims to have an appointment with you. Okay, I'll send him up, but I thought... It's the same person who came yesterday. Daniel had planned some sort of perfect crime. Especially since he had no apparent reason for killing her. And you understood this all by yourself. Of course, my dear. Is that the truth? No, it isn't. The inspector told me. Do you love me? Do you love only me? Only you.
