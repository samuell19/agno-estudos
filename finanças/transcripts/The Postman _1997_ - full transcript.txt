TELL THEM IT'S IMPORTANT. TELL THEM WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. The Postman: ONCE MORE INTO THE BREACH, DEAR FRIENDS, ONCE MORE. WE'LL CLOSE THE WALL WITH OUR DEAD. IN PEACE, NOTHING SO BECOMES A MAN AS MODESTY AND HUMILITY, BUT WHEN THE BLAST OF WAR BLOWS IN OUR EARS, THEN IMITATE THE ACTION OF THE TIGER, SUMMON UP THE BLOOD, DISGUISE FAIR NATURE WITH RAGE AND LEND THE EYE A TERRIBLE ASPECT. WHO ARE THEY? I DON'T KNOW. LOOKS LIKE MOSTLY WOMEN AND YOUNG PEOPLE TO ME. HOW MANY? UH, IT'S AN ARMY. AT LAST... SOMEONE WITH COURAGE ENOUGH TO BRING THE FIGHT TO ME. RECKONING, GENTLEMEN!

YOU KNOW, GENERAL, YOU'RE NOT EVEN A GOOD PAINTER. ARE YOU TRYING TO GOAD ME INTO A FIGHT? WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT IF WARS COULD BE FOUGHT JUST BY THE ASSHOLES WHO STARTED THEM? WE CAN SETTLE THIS RIGHT HERE. YOU AND ME. MM. WELL, UNFORTUNATELY, IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY. BUT IT DOES IN YOUR ARMY. I INVOKE LAW 7 OF THE LAWS OF 8! ANY MAN MAY CHALLENGE FOR LEADERSHIP OF THE CLAN. WHAT? I CHALLENGE YOU. YOU'RE NOT A HOLNIST. YOU'RE NOT A MEMBER OF THE CLAN. YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT. I HAVE EVERY RIGHT! I INVOKE LAW 7.

I SHOULD HAVE FOUND A WAY TO KILL YOU THEN, BUT YOU SEEMED SO STRONG. LAW 7... IT IS! THIS WAR IS SETTLED HERE! I STUDY PEOPLE. I KNOW YOUR PROBLEM. DO YOU KNOW WHY YOU CAN'T FIGHT? HUH? BECAUSE YOU HAVE NOTHING TO FIGHT FOR. YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT ANYTHING. YOU DON'T VALUE ANYTHING. YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ANYTHING. THAT'S WHAT MAKES ME BETTER. I BELIEVE... IN THE UNITED STATES. NO. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY. WE DON'T HAVE TO KILL EACH OTHER. Ford: LAW 3... MERCY IS FOR THE WEAK. FORD, DON'T. LAW 8... THERE'S ONLY ONE PENALTY, AND THAT PENALTY IS DEATH.

Hope: MY FATHER SAW HOW FRAGILE WE ARE AND HOW QUICKLY WE FELL INTO THE HANDS OF TYRANNY. HE SAW THAT ORDINARY MEN COULD REACH DEEP WITHIN THEMSELVES AND FIND COURAGE. HE SAW THAT IF WE BEGAN TO COMMUNICATE AS A NATION, WE COULD BECOME STRONG AGAIN, UNITED, BUT HE NEVER DID SEE ST. ROSE. HE SAID... THERE WAS TOO MUCH TO BE DONE. HE'D MADE A PROMISE, AND IN KEEPING IT, HE TRADED ONE DREAM FOR ANOTHER, WITH NO REGRETS. AND SO, IN HONOR OF MY FATHER... [APPLAUSE] THAT WAS ME. CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY WARNER BROS.
