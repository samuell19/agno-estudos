It's up to your paper, Fillmore, to support the honest people in this community. Yes, you know as well as we do, Hackett don't deserve to re-elected sheriff. Why, we been robbed right and left, and he ain't done nothing about it. Well now, boys, our paper's always been ready to serve the people, all of the people. Then let's get Hackett and the whole mob outta the election, put in an honest man for a change. Well, just for the moment, we haven't decided on the editorial policy for our paper at the coming election, whether we're going to support Houston or Hackett. But I give you my word, boys, that we'll support the right man. Say, now thanks again, gentlemen, for coming in. I appreciate it, thank you. There we go. Ee-yaaa, there you are, Julie. I told you I'd get you down here in plenty of time. Stage won't be here for another 15 minutes yet. You can't blame me for being a little bit anxious. Good morning, Mr. Fillmore. Good morning. Well, my goodness, Julie. You look like you were off for the day. All dressed up, huh? Why sure, didn't you know that-- Shh, Scoop, it's a surprise. Surprise, well, I hope it's a pleasant one. I'm sure it'll be just as pleasant a surprise for you as it is for me. Yes, well, say, would I have time to run a little errand before it takes place? Mm-hmm, but don't you be too long. No. Julie, why didn't you tell him your brother was coming in on the stage? Seems to me, he'd be glad to know that Bill was outta jail. I mean, coming home. Why, of course he'll be glad. That's why I wanted to surprise him. Mr. Fillmore isn't as young as he used to be, and Bill will be able to take over a lot of his work here on the paper. Yeah, I bet Bill's got some up-to-date ideas about running the paper too. That's why I went out and got one of them newfangled picture boxes. Picture boxes? A kimona, chamelia, a cameera. You mean a camera. Well that's what I said. What's she think I am, iggorant? And it's getting serious, Cash. Why the ranchers are complaining that they're getting a raw deal, that their cattle's being stolen, -that they're being cheated. -So what? Well they insist on running Tom Houston for sheriff. Now, Cash, can't you just take it easy, just until after election? The ranchers demand that I print the truth. So they want the truth? All right, give it to them. Tell them these stories are just a pack of lies, put out by Tom Houston, who's trying to get himself elected as sheriff on a campaign of mudslinging. Why nobody would believe that. Say, what kind of an editor are you that you can't make people believe the truth? Hurry up, Scoop, the stage'll be here in just a minute. Just as soon as I get out from underneath this thing. Oh my goodness. Hold still. Boy, that's tricky. But she's worth it. This'll the first picture of the Buffalo Springs Independent. We'll be just like them city papers. Hurry up, Scoop. Just a minute, Julie, I wanna see how this flashlight works. It says right here. Put a little flash powder in the trough. It don't say how little, but it does say not too much. Then hold it away from you. And then turn the flint and the flint lights the flash powder. Well that's simple. Now go over there and strike a pose. I'm gonna take your picture. Now, wait a minute, there you are. Now we'll see if the flint works. The flint works. -Good morning, Mr. Houston. -Miss Linda. Good morning, Judge. Well, how's our next sheriff? I hope we're not too late. The stage'll be along any minute now. When Bill Fargo steps into his father's shoes, the Independent'll help you wage a real fight for honest government in this community. -Julie. -Linda. Oh, I'm so happy for you with Bill coming home. Isn't it wonderful? Linda, the fact that Bill has been away won't make any difference to you, will it? Oh, of course not. I only hope the rest of this town won't hold it against him. ♪ Welcome home ♪ ♪ We're all here to meet you and really greet you home ♪ ♪ Each gal and fellow ♪ ♪ Says hi there and hello ♪ ♪ We hope you never ever roam ♪ ♪ Welcome home ♪ What's the celebration for? I don't know. Julie said something about a surprise. Get out, hi, hi! Here comes the stage, it's sure in a hurry.

Why didn't you tell me Bill Fargo was out of jail? Why, I didn't know, Cash. Linda. Mr. Houston, it's certainly nice to have a turnout like this to greet an old jailbird. That's no way to talk, that's all over now. Thanks to Judge Tyler. All I know was that Julie and Judge Tyler were working on his parole. Ahhhh. After all, he served three years. Now that he is out, I don't want him sticking his nose into that newspaper. I know but, Cash, he owns half of it. His father and I were partners. We can do the same to him as we did to his old man. Now look, boys, let's not have any more trouble. Why don't you make up your mind which side of the fence you're on? Suppose the kid found out you framed him and sent him to jail and then had his old man bumped off? Why, Cash, that was your idea. Vic Savage killed his father. And I'm beginning to think I killed the wrong man. There must be some way out of this besides more killings. Stop sniveling. Get out there and act like you're glad to see him. With the election coming on, this is a bad time for Bill Fargo to show up. Yeah. He'll probably take over the paper. I'm gonna have a talk with Sheriff Hackett. Now, that's just right, just one more thing. Now Bill, will you put your arm around the girls? That's it. They told me to say watch the birdie. That's what the book says, but I ain't got no birdie, so why should I say watch the birdie? Kinda silly, ain't it? Now hold still, everybody. Here, Judge, that's it, straighten up. That's it, now you look nice, Judge. Now hold still, everybody, don't move. I just wanna get another peek. That's it, hold still. Look right here, keep smiling. Smile, everybody, show your teeth. This is gonna be a good one, I'll bet you. Now hold still. Right now. Well, well, my goodness, Bill, hello. Hello, Clem. Glad to see you back. Guess your anxious to get back in the harness, huh? I'm anxious to get my fingers back in the ink again. I thought so, now come on in the office. Now, Mr. Fillmore, if you don't mind, I'm kinda anxious to get this picture. What picture? I'm taking it. Step right back in there, will you please? That's it, now please, everybody, hold your chins up. Keep smiling. Just get over a little closer. That's it, now I just wanna take one more picture. Now keep smiling folks, that's it, keep smiling. Doggone, that's funny. Can't see a thing, must be outta focus. You're standing in the same place. Now, folks, don't laugh, just smile, that's it. All right. This camera's got legs, it's walking. And I don't want him making any moves I don't know about. That's easy, if he's out on parole, he's under my jurisdiction. Well get over there and let him know that he still isn't a free man. Tom Houston has agreed to run for sheriff against Hackett, and we'll need all the support this newspaper can give. You know, Bill, since your dad's gone, this paper hasn't been the same. Well now we've always maintained-- I don't say you haven't tried, Clem. But we've got a fight on our hands, and we need the support of every man and woman in this county. This is yours, Bill. Dad always wanted you to have it. Thanks, Sis. But I can't carry a gun anymore. That's right, he can't. He's out on parole. Hiya, Fargo. Hello, Sheriff. I see you got-- Say, wait a minute, what are you doing with a gun? Convicted murderers aren't allowed the same privileges as honest people. Hackett, even you ought to know the difference between a murderer and a man you helped frame. This gun belonged to my dad. I was just looking at it. Here, Sis, put it back on the wall. I don't know how they expect a man to keep this town clean when they let troublemakers like him outta jail. I know just how you feel. When then let me tell you something. As a paroled convict, if I ever see you packing a gun or disturbing the peace, you're gonna go right back where you came from. You mean if you're still sheriff. You don't have to worry about Bill, I'll vouch for him. He's paroled to me. Well I'm still the law and order in this county, and what I said before still goes. Don't worry, Sheriff.

All right, you go that way, I'll go that way. It's quite a nice turnout, Mr. Houston. Yeah, shall we start the meeting? Maybe we oughta wait for Fillmore. I don't think he'll be here. He doesn't think our paper should take sides. I don't understand Clem. Guess he's just getting old. Oh, he'll be all right, he'll swing around later on. I tried to keep him from printing it, Cash, but I was afraid to say anything more for fear they might suspect something. You wouldn't want that, would you? Now I'm sure I shot the wrong guy. A newspaper has no right attacking an officer of the law. It's slander, that's what it is. Well they'll probably say more than that at the meeting this afternoon. I suppose they'll be spreading a lot more of those lies. There's only one way of finding out. Vic, round up some of the boys. What are you going to do, Cash? Never mind what we're gonna do. You just go home and start writing. What'll I write, an editorial? No, an obituary. And I tell you again that our newspaper is going to stand for the same principle that it stood for when my father was running it. And that principle is clean government. And here's a man who's going to give it to us. Your candidate and mine, Mr. Tom Houston, our next sheriff. Citizens of Bannon County. Hold it, everybody, and I'll take a picture of you. That's it, don't be afraid. Look pretty, ladies. Turn around this way, that's it. Hold it. Nothing's gonna happen. That's it, hold it. Doggone it, Brownie, you didn't have to take it out on me. Look out for that camera, doggone it. Doggone, you didn't have to take out on the camera too. I'm afraid that horse won't improve your picture. But now to get down to the more serious things. You know, Cash, perhaps it isn't such a good idea, me attending their rally. You're the sheriff of this county, aren't you? You're just here to keep peace, in case somebody starts trouble. Sure, go on, Sheriff, get lost in the crowd. Maybe you'll learn something about making campaign speeches. Any gunplay that's occurred here always favored Scanlon's henchmen. And these things have been going on beneath our very noses. This never woulda happened if Sheriff Hackett hadn't been the tool of those cutthroats. There's Scanlon and his men. Please don't start anything. Don't you worry, honey. If I'm elected, I promise you this. The undesirable element of this community will not be called my closest friends. You're doing an awful lotta talking about the undesirable element. But I've never seen Sheriff Hackett palling around with a jailbird. He wouldn't have been in jail if he hadn't been convicted by as crooked a jury as you could hire. You've said just about enough. You stay outta this, Fargo, unless you wanna go back to jail. This is a fair fight. All right, everybody, stand back, stand back. I'll take charge here. I demand that you arrest Savage for murder. What do you mean murder? Houston went for his gun first, I saw him do it. That's right. What do you want me to do, arrest a man for shooting in self-defense? Self-defense? That's cold-blooded murder if I ever saw it. Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute, folks! If we take things in our own hands, we'll destroy the thing we're fighting for. And that's law and order. You're smarter than I gave you credit for. Thanks, Scanlon. I've always heard there were more ways of killing a chicken than by ringing its neck. And I guess there are just as many ways of killing a snake. Here, print this story. Bill said he wanted to write the Houston story up himself. No, no, I can't hold up the paper. There's the story, I just wrote it. This says that Savage killed Houston in self-defense, and that ain't what happened. I got that story straight from Sheriff Hackett with his signed statement, now go ahead and set it up. Not me, I ain't gonna print this story. What do you mean? I'm still giving orders around here, ain't I? Yes, you're still giving orders, but I ain't taking them from nobody but Bill. What seems to be the trouble? He wants me to run the story saying that Savage killed Houston in self-defense. And you know that ain't true. You seen it with your own eyes. That's right, Mr. Fillmore. Tom Houston was deliberately murdered. Well, Julie, we can't doubt the word of our sheriff. Doubt the word of our sheriff. You better go find Bill, Julie. Don't worry, Mr. Fillmore, Bill will be able to straighten everything out as soon as I can find him. He's out trying to scare up another candidate for sheriff. Yeah, well, I can't hold up the paper for Bill. I'll find him. Hey, Cash, I've gotta talk to you. I'm glad you came in. We should run this ad in our paper. What's this? Only advertising the Houston place for public auction. I wanna pick it up for unpaid taxes. But don't let Fargo know you're running this ad. Kinda sneak it in. All right, Cash, all right. But just know, I've gotta talk to you about something else. Gee, Linda, I wish you'd help me talk your dad into running for sheriff. He's just the man we need. No use, Bill. There's nothing I'd like better, but I'm too old. Oh, that's just what you think. And besides, Bill, it's too dangerous. Bill, you'd better come down to the paper right away. Why, what's the hurry, Sis? I'll tell you on the way. See you later, Linda. Goodbye, Judge. With Fargo out of the way, you could run any kind of story you wanted. I'm not gonna stand for you killing Bill. Who said anything about killing? That's the fartherest thing from my mind. But Fargo's out on parole. He could go back to jail just for being in a fight. Why you don't think he's dumb enough to start a fight, do you? No, but I think he's dumb enough to start swinging if somebody else started trouble. How about it, Vic? Why this ain't gonna be trouble. It's gonna be fun. Why don't you look where you're going? I'm sorry, Savage. I have a good notion to punch you right in the nose. Nothing would give me any more pleasure than to have you try, but the laws says I can't fight and you know it. Bill! Pick him up, Bill, pick him up. Come on now, come on now. That's it, Bill. I warned you, Fargo, if I ever caught you starting any trouble, I'd send you back where you came from. Savage started this fight. He didn't shoot in self-defense that time, did he, Sheriff? Why don't you arrest Savage? All right, Savage, you're under arrest. Come on, Julie, let's get the paper out. A few days ago, I thought we could fight our battle with words. But now I'm convinced it's going to take more than that. We have got to stand together and fight for a common cause. Form a vigilante committee. We're with you, Bill, what's the next move? Find a candidate that we can trust, a man like Tom Houston. Then it's up to us to see that he's elected. You sure made a mess of things. Now you're gonna stay in there until the election's over. You mean you're gonna take a chance on an election? Sure, they're holding a meeting tonight, to pick their new candidate for sheriff, and who do you think it's gonna be? Santy Claus. No, but you're getting warm. I got men spotted all over that meeting. They're going to make sure that the new candidate is going to be that fearless, law-abiding citizen of the people. Fillmore for sheriff! Clem Fillmore himself, we want Clem Fillmore. Well, Clem, it looks like you're the man they want. And if you're not afraid of Hackett and Scanlon, we're behind you. Well now, Bill, if you're referring to that Houston story, I didn't have the slightest idea of the true facts, but I can assure you that my eyes are open. That's fine. I wanna take a picture. Look right out there please. That's it, everybody, hold still. Look right in here, and I'll take your picture, I hope. I wanna just look, see what you look like. Oh my goodness, you're upside down. Oh, well I guess it. Here we go now, wait a minute. Up, up. You're a little bit too close. I gotta come back a little, now hold still, I'm coming right back with you. Everything's all right, hey! Doggone it. There you are, Miss Linda. Thanks, Scoop. Well, Mr. Fillmore, I'll bet you feel pretty proud with the paper saying what a great man you are. I only hope I can live up to everything that's being written about me. Well, Linda, looks like they've got you working too. You said that we were all united in a great cause. That's right. A few more stories like this and we'll have Hackett and Scanlon on the run. Bill, Scanlon's out at Mrs. Houston's, foreclosing on the place. Foreclosing? He claims he's buying it for unpaid taxes, and Mrs. Houston has to be off the property by noon. Scoop, you and Julie round up a few men and meet me at the Houston place. Linda, where's your father? He's probably at the courthouse. I'll go get him, I want this thing to be legal. Come on, Sheriff, let's start this auction and get it over with. Can't do a thing until 12 o'clock. It isn't 12 yet, I can tell by the sun. Don't you ever carry a watch. Don't need one. Sun's my timepiece. Then maybe your timepiece needs regulating. Because my watch says one minute to 12. All right, start your spiel, we want this nice and legal. Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye. According to the authority vested in me by Bannon County, I hereby proclaim all property belonging to the deceased, Tom Houston, subject to public sale for delinquent taxes due and owing said county. Do I hear any bids? No, but you're gonna hear what I've got to say. Well now, Mrs. Houston, I have told you before that I'm only doing what the law demands. But the law wants you to be fair with honest folk. If you'll just give me a little time, I know I can raise the money. Unfortunately, Mrs. Houston, your husband was too busy meddling in other people's affairs to take care of his own. There are only two sure things in life, death and taxes. Too bad your husband didn't take care of his taxes before, well, before his time was up. His time wasn't up, you just set the clock ahead. Whoaaaa. There they are, dividing up the spoils. Judge, are you sure that property has to be advertised for three days before it can be sold for back taxes? That's the law, my boy. I see, that's all I wanna know. Better wait for Julie and the boys. There's liable to be trouble. Maybe you're right. All right, let's go. That's Fargo, and he's got some of his vigilante committee with him. All right, boys. You're too late, boys, the bidding's all over. Yeah, and we don't want anybody interfering with the majesty of the law. The majesty of the law, that coming from you is a laugh. Judge Tyler here will tell you what the law is. The law of this state says that before any action for dispossession can be taken, a three-day notice must appear in the local newspaper. That three-day notice did appear, and in your paper. For a fellow who is always minding somebody else's business you certainly don't pay much attention to your own. There must be some mistake. All right, then let's go back to town and see Fillmore. I'll prove that this smart aleck is just aiming to stir up a lotta trouble. Believe me, Mrs. Houston, if Mr. Fillmore put that ad in the paper, Bill knew nothing about it. All I know is, ever since your brother got out of jail, things have been happening too fast. What's the trouble, boys? Clem, why'd didn't you tell me you ran this ad on the Houston property? You and my father were partners, and I always thought you stood for the same things he stood for. But now I know you don't. I demand we dissolve our partnership, and I demand you withdraw from the race for sheriff. If the people want me for sheriff, I'm at their service. Seems to me you're doing an awful lot of demanding, Fargo, when you should be doing an awful lot of explaining. I have nothing to explain. I thought Fillmore here was honest. Nobody says he isn't, except you. And who's going to believe a jailbird. Come on, boys, I guess we've shown up our fearless editor. I coulda told you Fillmore wasn't the right man for sheriff. I'll bet he wouldn't even take a good picture. Anybody knows that a politician's gotta take a good picture if he ever expects to be elected. All of the pictures in the world won't help. What we need is a candidate who won't sell us out to Scanlon. I can't understand Clem. Maybe he didn't mean anything wrong, Bill. Whether he did or not, it doesn't help our cause any. Our ranks are split, and when we start fighting among ourselves, we're playing right into Scanlon's hands. Cash, I've gotta see you. I told you 1,000 times to stay out of this office. Well that's why I came in the back way. Nobody saw me. What's on your mind? Well I'm, I'm worried, I can't go through with it. What's there to go through with? Everything's fine. Oh, I don't know, just chalk it up to the fact that I have a conscience, I guess. I always knew you had a yella streak, but a conscience? Huh, where you been hiding it all these years? Look, Clem, you're in this as deep as the rest of us. You can't back out now, and if you gotta worry about it, go somewhere else to do it. I got troubles of my own. All right, Scanlon, you'll never hear another peep outta me about my troubles. Now if I was running for sheriff, I tell you what I'd do. I'd promise the people, uh, uh. What would I promise the people? We ain't had any rain for quite a spell. I'd promise the people a lotta rain. Oh, Scoop, this is serious. Oh I know it's serious. But I could be, I could be a sheriff. A ain't a-scared of nobody. So who would take your picture? Yeah, who'd take my picture? I'd take my own picture. I'd get right back here like this. Now that'd be easy. Clem, I didn't think you had nerve enough to come here again. Sure, I know what you're gonna say, Bill, so I'll say it for you. Yes, I double-crossed you. I've been working with Scanlon for a good many years. Now if I was to take a picture of myself sitting right where you're sitting, I tell you what I'd do. First I'd come over here. Then I'd take out this plate like that. Oh boy, now, what would I do? Oh yes, I'd take the flashlight and the flame. Move over, move over, I'll show you, hee hee. I'd put the flashlight right down there like that. And put some powder there. Then I'd put this bulb right down here like this. Put one foot on the bulb and the other on the flashlight, and that's the way I'd do it. Out of the way, Scoop, Clem here's gonna write a confession that'll stand this town right on its ear. A confession? Listen, you two, ride out and get Judge Tyler, then round up the Vigilante Committee and tell them we've got all the evidence in the world to run Scanlon and his mob outta town, now hurry. All right, Clem, start talking. Julie, what brings you out here this time of night? Judge, we've got to round up the Vigilante Committee. Has anything happened to Bill? No, but something's gonna happen to a lotta other people. Judge, get your horse. Looks like Scanlon was right when he told us to keep an eye on Tyler tonight. Wish I could hear what they're saying. You will soon enough. When they ride out, we'll join them, kinda casual like. Anything wrong, Judge? Nothing but your opinions, boys. Bill Fargo was as innocent of what happened today as you were. Sure, Clem Fillmore's down at the newspaper office right now making out a confession. What's Fillmore confessing? I don't know, but Bill says it'll run Scanlon right outta town. That's why we're rounding up the vigilantes. We'll round up some of the boys ourselves. Why don't we take the north fork? Thanks, boys, that'll help a lot. Meet you in town. After he got you outta the way, he tried to buy the newspaper. And, when your father wouldn't sell, why-- Yeah, I know the rest. Fillmore's over at the newspaper office, spilling everything he knows. What? And they're rounding up the vigilantes. Well, ain't you gonna do anything about it? Sure, I'm gonna do some rounding up myself. Here they are, Clem, just waiting your signature. I guess you know, Bill, that this is like signing my own death warrant. Well, if it's Scanlon you're afraid of, don't worry. He'll be in jail with Savage before the night's out. Hiya, Scanlon, I thought you'd forgotten all about me. Hey, what's going on here? Don't get excited, Hackett, I'm just taking Vic out for a little air. And I sure need it. This is the stuffiest place I've ever been in. You said you were gonna leave him here till after election. Keep your shirt on, Hackett. I'm only borrowing him for a few minutes. Come on, Vic. But you can't do that, I'm still sheriff here. And if you wanna keep on being sheriff, go back to sleep. You didn't see him leave, you won't see him coming back. As far as you're concerned, he's been in jail all the time. Say, Bill, I've got an awful lot of signing to do. I wish I had a drink. I'm sorry I can't offer you one. Here, have one of your campaign cigars. Yes, I guess I can't pass them out. I might just as well smoke them myself. He and Fillmore are in there alone. Now if we can just get Fargo away from there. What's this all about? Look, Vic, you always said you killed the wrong man. Well this time I'm giving you a chance to kill the right one, only you've got a perfect alibi. You're in jail. Bill, you're not gonna let the vigilantes do anything to me, are you? You have my word, Clem, they'll go easy on you. After all, if it wasn't for your confession, it would be-- Hey, there's somebody at the door. Don't worry, it's probably Julie and the boys. You writing something, Fillmore? Why, yes, just a little something for the paper. You mind if I, take a look? You dirty, sniveling rat. Why, this is downright slander. So you were just an innocent tool in the hands of Scanlon. And I'm the most cold-blooded killer in the West. Now that's what I call right pretty sentiment. Too bad nobody ain't gonna read it. So listen, Vic, can't we talk this thing over? Scanlon's not a bad fellow, maybe he'd listen to reason. Save your breath, Fillmore. What are you trying to do? You better get rid of these. Sheriff, I thought I heard a shot from the newspaper office. Don't you think you'd better investigate? -What happened, Bill? -Somebody shot Fillmore. All right, boys, you better stay out here. I'll take charge here. What are you doing with a gun? I picked it up outside. Fillmore found dead, and you standing there with a gun. All right, hand it over and come along with me. Listen, I didn't do this, but I can't prove it if I'm locked up in that two by four jail of yours. I'm warning you, Fargo, you're under arrest. You'll have to get me first. From now on, I'm gonna use your kind of weapons, guns. ♪ She was everything a cowboy could desire ♪ ♪ She had such a lovely face ♪ ♪ When she looked at me, she set my heart afire ♪ ♪ With her charm and her feminine grace ♪ ♪ Geraldine, queen of all the cowboys ♪ ♪ Her beauty was fair to see ♪ ♪ Geraldine, queen of all the cowboys ♪ ♪ The pride of the whole prairie ♪ ♪ With her big brown eyes, she set my pulses pounding ♪ ♪ Even though her skin was rough ♪ ♪ I'm aware this all may seem a bit astounding ♪ ♪ But her beauty was virtue enough ♪ ♪ How her eyes would shine each evening when I'd greet her ♪ ♪ She would heave such winning sighs ♪ ♪ And although at times I found I had to beat her ♪ ♪ It was always with tears in my eyes ♪ ♪ Geraldine, queen of all the cowboys ♪ ♪ Her beauty was fair to see ♪ ♪ Geraldine, queen of all the cowboys ♪ ♪ The pride of the whole prairie ♪ ♪ But at last that devil age crept up and got her ♪ ♪ And although it may seem cruel ♪ ♪ I took out my gun and tenderly I shot her ♪ ♪ Geraldine, my adorable mule ♪ ♪ Geraldine, queen of all the cowboys ♪ ♪ The pride of the whole prairie ♪ Well, Hackett, you can't say I didn't do my duty.

Fillmore's out of the way, Fargo is a fugitive with a murder charge hanging over his head. I'd feel a lot better if he was in jail myself. Forget it, Hackett. I've got my men posted at every road that leads into town. He'll never show his face around here again. Did you find Bill? No, but I heard some of the Scanlon men talking. They didn't find him neither. Well that's something. I'm going out and see if Judge Tyler and Linda have come to town. Straighten things up a little, will you, Scoop? Yes, ma'am. Miss Julie, Miss Julie. Look what I found. Why that isn't Bill's handwriting. It was right near the spot where the found Fillmore. Maybe it's got something to do with his killing. Scoop, do you know how to develop a picture? Sure, it says so right in the book, come on. Keep that door closed, Julie, it's gotta be dark in here. All right, how's it getting along? The book says it's gotta be dark, and when it's dark, I can't read the rest of the instructions. Well why don't you go out in the other room and read it? That won't work either, because when I get back in here I'll forget what the rest of the book says. Oh. Oh, keep that door closed. Something's gotta happen pretty soon. Come on, camera, be a good little camera and give Scoopy a picture. I'm worried about Bill, Dad. I think Bill can take care of himself, Linda. What worries me is that, everything Bill and I have been fighting for is lost. Voting for Hackett? If I wasn't, I'd have stayed home. Ain't nobody else running, is there? Maybe everything isn't lost, Linda. Bill wanted me to run for sheriff in the first place. Old or not, I'm going to do it. It's pretty late now, do you think you have a chance? I can try. We've got friends. You go down to the newspaper office. Tell Scoop and Julie, they'll help. I got it all wrong. The book doesn't tell me to dump the whole camera in the developer. -Well of course it doesn't. -Only the film. Well what are you waiting for? Why don't you go in and do it? I already did it. I don't understand you, don't you think I know anything? Julie, Scoop, what do you think? Dad's gonna run for sheriff. Haaa. Giddyup, come on, giddyup. Hi, gents. I'm not running for sheriff because of any political gains. I have no ax to grind. I'm running for a principle. And if you men believe in that principle, go out there and vote for me. And we'll show Scanlon and Hackett that we're not licked yet. Judge Tyler gets my vote. Well, I've done most everything. Something oughta happen pretty soon. Do you think it'll really work? That's what the book says. Look, it happened. Yoo-hoo! Savage killed Fillmore. How could he, he was in jail? Well take a look at that, it's right there. So, that's it. Hackett let him out of jail so he could kill Fillmore. Oh, I wish Bill were here. Well, he ain't, there's only one thing I know to do. Print this picture and get out a special edition. Go get your dad. What's this Linda's been telling me about a picture? Here it is. -Bill. -Bill. Hello, Sis. You shouldn't have taken a chance on coming back. I had to. It's a good thing you did, we've got a lot to tell you. -My camera finally took a picture. -Now don't talk nonsense. I came back here to stop this crooked election. And Scoop's picture is the only thing can do it. The presses are all set up. We was just getting ready to put it in the paper. Good, if we can get the paper out before the poll closes, we still have a chance to win this election. Come on. There you are, Julie. I've got to have more papers, Bill. Everybody wants one. Good, now we'll see how the election goes. There you are, Bill. If I run off any more papers, the press is gonna burn up. The fool, didn't he know that Fillmore was taking a picture? How are the votes, are we in the majority? Sure, but I don't know for how long the way the Tyler votes are coming in. We'll close the polls. The election's over, now get Savage over here. But you can't do that. It isn't time yet. My watch says six o'clock. Sorry, the polls are closed. But we haven't voted yet. You're too late to vote now. That's a fine thing, he can't do that to us. Come on! They won't let us vote, they closed the polls. They did, eh? Well we're going to open them. But, Bill, you're a wanted man, you can't go out there. Maybe I can't, but I am. Then I guess I'd better come along. Me too, I smell a fight. If you wanna get in on it, you better hurry. I'm hurrying, where's my hat? Yeah, I smell a fight. A good one too. I wonder if this is loaded. It's loaded! Hackett, Hackett, Hackett. Another one for Hackett, and Hackett. 112. Well, Hackett, you're reelected sheriff. Good. Scanlon, take a look at this. Hackett, go out there and arrest them. I couldn't do anything with that mob. All right then, we will. Hey, we better get outta here, fellas. Hackett, we are asking you to open these doors and let us vote. Polls are closed. Tell him the law, Judge. The law says the polls don't close till sundown. You can regulate a lotta things around here, Scanlon, but you can't regulate the sun. You fellas better get outta here, or I'll start shooting. Come on, Scanlon, let's get out of here while the getting's good. Just a minute. There's just one thing I wanna fix. Here, don't hold your hat so high. And put your chin up. Oh boy, I can see the headlines now. Sheriff's daughter marries young editor. And right underneath'll be your picture. Are you sure you know what you're doing? This is one time I do know what I'm doing. Now, now, now, don't move. All right, we'll hold perfectly still. I'll just take one more picture to make sure. That's it, all righty. Now just hold that pose. Now let's just get this just right now. Watch me. Edited e syncr. by WesternKasa /GM NOV2020
