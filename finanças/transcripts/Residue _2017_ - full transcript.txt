(tense music) (motorcycle revs) (music swells) (knocking) - [Man At Door] John. - (Sighs) Anthony. - John. - Now is not a good time. (whooshing) (door creaks) (door thuds) (soft rattling) (door slams) (unsettling music) - How the hell are ya, John? You all right? You, uh, fucked up? I mean, I know I'm a bit fucked up, but it's just the whiskey. (exhales) I imagine you are fucked up in a whole different kinda way, huh? - I'm fine, Anthony. I just need to get back to my work. - Oh yeah? What page are you on, John? (John groans) Huh? - I just reached page 40. I believe. Yes. One of the companions is missing. And so is his knife. So yes, I just reached page 40. (Anthony sighs heavily) - I see. (sighs) Okay, John. I thought you'd be special. But I'm afraid your time is up. (jarring tones) What can I say? I'm very sorry. - I just reached page 40. - You've been on page 40 for six goddamn weeks. - What? No. No, it can't have been. I don't have that much time. (Anthony sighs) - But Lamont says it's time for the book to move on. - Wouldn't do that, Anthony. It doesn't like violence. (jarring notes) (Anthony chuckles) - Well then, it's gonna hate me. (gun clicks) (sick squishing) (whipping) (groans) God damnit, John. (chittering) You are past page 40. - Oh look, you're right. Page 43. - Fuck you. (gun fires) - It would be painless. (gun fires) (Anthony shouts) Or so it keeps telling me. (gun fires multiple shots) - Fuck you, John. (screams) Son of a... - If only there was a quicker way. To just skip to the end. (eerie tones) (sharp whooshing) (flesh squelching) (John gags) - [Electronic Voice] Your device storage is full. Create cloud storage? - [Luke] Private journal from Luke Harding. This is for whoever reads the book next. I'm not sure how I've made it this far, but maybe my story will help you reach the end of yours. How did this all start? I guess you need to know how I ended up with the book. I need to back up a couple of cases, when I first started working for Mr. Fairweather. I thought it was a simple surveillance job. Follow 10 people. And catch them doing something just a little dirty. It sounded simple enough. Hell, I'd already knocked off the first eight. But the ninth was a well-respected priest. I really thought this one would take awhile. But I was forgetting what side of the tracks I was on. - Prostitution is immoral. Proverb 23:27. For a prostitute is a deviant and an adulteress. (suspenseful music) (drone hums) - [Prostitute] Let's say I give you the candy 'round back and then call it a night. - [Luke] I was so close to a payday. But what I didn't realize was something really valuable was passing through town. (metallic clanging) (groaning) My employer was about to make a very dangerous power play. And there I was, about to walk right into the middle of it all. I had to keep my tail between my legs. Because as easy as the first nine on my list had been, the 10th had proven impossible. - [Man] Let's go. - [Luke] It was time to have an audience with Mr. Fairweather, a wrestling promoter turned crook. (loud thudding) (electronic rattling) (energetic rock music) (horn blowing) (audience cheering) The champ had arrived. Scotty was Fairweather's right hand man. We went back. We had been friends and enemies several times. I wasn't sure where the scorecard had left off when Scotty introduced me to Fairweather. And I was too broke to care. (distant crowd cheering) (loud thudding) - [Wrestler] Lookin' forward to tonight, man. - So there's two things, all right. Two things. - [Wrestler] I'm gonna give your guys a throw down. - Are you in the show? - Pardon? - Oh, are you workin' with Fairweather? - I work for myself. - Me, I'm both. You doin' a list? You know, basic shit. Try to find a little dirt on each person. - [Man On Right Chair] Yeah, throw down... - Hey, who took my fuckin' cheese grater? Was it fuckin' you? - Take it easy, Ferox. Mr. Fairweather will see you now. - Mr. Luke Harding. I gotta tell ya, I got a five year old niece who could fly a drone better than you. But you got what I needed for that guy, so. - Good. - I just got one glaringly obvious thing the discuss here. Seeing as how I gave you a list with 10 names on it. - I know, but... - Now, I ain't no math magician, but I'm only seein' nine files here. Yo Larry. - Yes, sir. - If I was to ask you for, say, 10 cigars, what would you do? - Bring you 10 cigars, Mr. Fairweather. - And if you only came back with nine? - Oh no. I'd never come back with only nine, sir. - You see, Luke, that's why Larry is wearing more expensive shoes than you are. Why he smells better. Why he has a nicer haircut. Why there's pussy hangin' off him all the time. Because Larry knows how to fucking count to 10! - Look, I followed that Gary Huang guy for a month. Kid's clean. - So you're goin' to bat for this Squeaky McClean? - Yes. - So I'm payin' you to tell me that this kid could be standin' at the gates of heaven, and God himself wouldn't find the parking ticket. - Yes. And even with our contract, that states you only pay 1/2. - I know our fucking contract, Mr. Harding. And believe me, it was a one time thing. Now get the hell outta my office. - Actually, I was hoping to get that 1/2 now. - When Mr. Fairweather says it's time to go, it's time to go. - If you don't mind, I have some bills. - Yeah, if I don't mind. Suddenly you're all detente. If you don't mind, Mr. Fairweather, if you don't mind, Mr. Fairweather. Well, I mind. (thudding) For fuck's sake. (breathes heavily) What the fuck am I payin' ya for? Gimme a runway, god damnit. Okay. Here's your salary. (low uneasy music) You're a miserable failure, Harding. - Please welcome to the stage, Ruby Reds. (electronic dance music) - [Luke] Happy birthday to me. Time for my annual email from my father's estate. He paid to record dozens of messages for me from his deathbed. It was the greatest gift of all: a reminder that he was dead. - So, son, it's your 37th birthday. You were my one chance for a legacy. - Hey. - And look what I got to work with. - [Luke] Two shots, whiskey. - You miserable excuse for a human being. - Thanks for askin', dad. - Now, I know that life has probably chewed you up and spit you out a few times. - Angelina's doin' just fine. - You were the most pointless part of my existence. - I don't see her much, but - Your whore of a mother hated every second of you. - I try to be there for her. - And she, (coughs and gags) I think it's safe to say that you are probably worth... (earpiece beeps) (unsettling music) - [Luke] Having a terrible father was no excuse for being one. My daughter, Angelina, was havin' a rough go at her mother's. And here I was, just squeezin' by. And only gettin' 1/2 my pay meant I wasn't crawlin' out of my hole any time soon. But the least it was a start. Monica. - Luke. - I got my rent. And what I was short last month. - (vocalizes interest) It looks like Luke and Monica are up to something'. - What? - Are you sure you can do this? - Just take it while I got it. - Neighbor, hey. - Hey Edwin. - Hey, how you doin'? - Shut up. - Yeah, is it raining today, do you think? - No, I'm good. - It's not gonna rain to day. - I'm just tired of it. - What are you mumblin' about? - You got nothin' to say. - I hope it doesn't rain. - I hope it doesn't rain, too, buddy. - (scoffs) Get a drink. You old cow. - You worthless piece of shit. - [Edwin] The mountains are out. - Yeah, they certainly are. I guess the dream was to land one big case. Earn enough to move to a better section of town. Work for a bigger player. Like Mr. Lamont. He ran this city. A job from him could change a man's destiny. Whereas a call from Fairweather tended to be more trouble than it was worth. (cellphone rings) Hello? - Mr. Harding. Jules Fairweather here. - What now? - (groans) Don't be like that. I was actually just callin' to apologize. I sometimes let my emotions get ahead of me. I get so used to dealin' with dip-shits all day, you know. You know how it is. Anyway, it looks like you're right on point with this Gary Huang kid. So, my partners and I have a little test. Our friend Gary Hung has passed this test, so now we need to deliver to him his prize. - What kind of prize? - Well, that's the $10,000 question, isn't it? - [Luke] What do you mean? - I give you 10 grand to deliver this package, and you never ask that question again. - That's a lot of money. This isn't some kind of hit or anything? - A hit? (sighs) You think if I'm gonna commit a homicide, my first instinct is to call up some trailer park garbage for fuck's, (mumbling) fuckin' Christ. I'm just really sorry. I Must be off my meds. (chuckles) Thank you for your patience. I have a simple, but very important thing I ask. Deliver a package to Gary Huang, and I, I can't stress this enough, Gary himself has to be the who opens it now. You've tailed this guy for a month, so, you know his schedule. (Luke sighs heavily) Simple delivery job. - I'll be there in an hour. - What a fuckin' idiot. (unsettling tones) - [Scotty] Luke. - So, now's the time? - Yeah. Doctor Who is on in a couple of hours, and Gary always watches it alone. - Hmm. Then go to it. My associates will accompany you. - Well, I don't really need 'em. - Oh relax. They're on your side now. Gentle as kittens. - Meow. (foreboding tones) - I guess this Gary Huang is a pretty lucky guy, right? - Don't fish, Luke. It's very unbecoming. - Gimme your piece. - Who the fuck is this? - Got no idea. - But you know this is the first time that someone's actually passed the test. - What the hell are you talking about? - Scotty, you gotta pay more fuckin' attention. - Forgive me if I'm too busy main-eventing and getting laid - Oh God. To worry about your extra hired goon. - [Ferox] You make it sound so fuckin' dirty. (gun fires) (glass shatters) (Ferox groans) (tense music) - (groans) You fuckin' thing. (engine revving) (tires squealing) - [Scotty] What the fuck does he want? - [Ferox] He fuckin' shot me. - [Luke] Turn it. - Oh fuck. (Ferox groans) (Ferox breathes heavily) - Hustle, he's... - Scotty, I'm fucking dying, man. I fucking need you to do something or... - [Scotty] You want it in the temple? - Or I need to go to the hospital, you fuck. - (groans) Fuck this. - [Ferox] Scotty. (groans) Fuck, Scotty. - Unlock the door. - Scotty. - Open the door. Let's go. You, get the fuck out. (muffled speaking) (thudding) (Luke groans) Hurry up. Face the door. Face the door, you fuckin' prick. If they don't come in shooting. I'm callin' Fairweather. (blows connecting) (grunting) That was stupid. You really wanna do this, Luke? (tense music) You really wanna take on the champ? Huh? (blows connecting) (groaning) (Scotty shouts in surrender) (loud cracking) (Luke groans) That's why you can never play heal, brother. - [Luke] Yeah? (blow connecting) (grunting) - Oh shit. (heavy breathing) Luke. God damn karma. (loud thudding) Truce? - All right. (Scotty groans) Scotty. (thudding) (door creaks) Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. It's all good. I don't want any trouble. This is what you want, right? (gun fires) (Scotty shouts) (grunting) (metallic clanging) (groaning) - Shit. Oh. Oh, where you goin'? I'm not done. I'm not done. (aggressive shouting) (loud slamming) (blow connecting) (groaning) You get the fuck outta here. (blows connecting) (groaning) (loud clanging) (aggressive shouting) (bone cracking) (groaning) Was it Lamont? Huh? Did Lamont send you? (loud groaning) Huh? (ripping) Oh fuck! (flesh squelching) Ow, shit. (groaning) (gun fires) (body thudding) - Scotty. (Ferox coughs) - Oh fuck. Who the fuck are you? Fuck you, you... - Shh. - [Scotty] Fuck. (groans) - [Luke] What do you need, what do you need? - (groans) My glasses, my glasses. No, no, no, no, no, you. You put them on. (groans) Look at me, look at me. I look good, right? You look great, Scotty. - Oh yeah, I'll leave a good-lookin' corpse. Ow. (gasps) (sirens wail) (tense music) (Luke sighs) (unsettling tones) - [Luke] Whatever was in that package had somehow saved my life. Maybe deep down I felt a connection with it. Like I owed it something. (breathes raggedly) But the truth is, I killed one of Lamont's men. Not exactly the introduction I was looking for. If he was somehow involved, then I needed to get rid of that package immediately. (eerie tones) But I was still chasin' money. (creepy whispers) (soft creaking) (unsettling tones) (strange chirping) - [Explorer] I can feel you reading this as I write. The creature draws near. I can't help you survive. But if you want me to free your soul, you need only to stand up. Otherwise, - Please remain seated while reading this book. (foreboding music) (squishing) (eerie tones) Where are my keys. God damnit, where are my keys? (metallic jangling) (disturbing tones) (electronic rattling) (phone dialing) (phone ringing) - Hello? - I don't like gettin' shot at. But lucky for you, I still got your package. You want it back? - Well, yeah. - Here's the deal. You pay me what you promised for the delivery, I bring you the package back. We can call it danger pay for keeping your merchandise safe. - All right. - My place. Tomorrow at noon. 45th and Thurlow. Unit 273. - Very well. (tense music) - [Lamont] Oh Jules, what did you possibly think you could steal from me? Well, my friend, I hope you're ready. (gun fires) (sick squishing) I want you to go there, tomorrow, noon. Pay whatever the price, and bring me back my book. - Okay. - [Lamont] And bring Jacob with you. Things have been messed up enough already. I think we should err on the side of caution on this one. - Mm-hmm. (phone rings) - Hi honey. - Hey dad. Can you hear me okay? - Yeah, how are you? - Look, do remember when you said that, you know, if things ever got rough for me or whatever that I could come stay with you for awhile or something? - Yeah, I remember that. No, no, that's fine. It won't take me long to straighten up. (speaking in foreign language) (knocking) (Monica groans) - Luke, it's like almost 11 o'clock here. - I know. Yeah, I just realized what a terrible idea this is. - Am I supposed to mace you now? - I hope not. - Tell me what the hell it is you want. - Your cleaning services. And I can help. And I got this. I didn't have any cash left, but I do have this fine bottle of brandy. It's worth over $90. There's still at least 50 bucks worth. - You want me to help you clean that shit-hole apartment of yours tonight? - And I can pay you more later, too. - Look, I'm sorry, Luke. I clean all day, and I just really wanna... - I understand. But you know, just keep that bottle brandy, and I'll just, I'm sorry I bugged you. - Why do you want that apartment of yours cleaned by tomorrow? - [Luke] My daughter. She's coming. - Oh no. You do not lay some sob story on me. Especially about some kid. How old is she? - 18, just. - How rough's she had it? - Very rough. - So there's a slim chance right now that you can make up for a fraction of the crap that you put her through. - A small chance. - And you've got paper towels? - Well yeah, I think I've got a... - I'll be over in five. - [Luke] Oh my God, thank you so much. - Be ready. - I will. (cart rattles) - I knew this was a job for big old Bobby. Okay. (sighs) I'll get started here. You get to the bathroom. And don't hesitate to throw anything out. I'm gonna stack anything that looks important on your table. You can go through it later. (dark tones) Okay. Only two more trips to the dumpster and then we're done. (eerie tones) - It's so... - Adequate? (foreboding tones) So, how long's it been? Since you've seen your daughter? - Two years. Probably more. - You miss her? - So much. But I mean, I ain't got much. - You've got a safe place to sleep. Sometimes that's enough. - I guess. - There was a time in my life where I would have killed for just enough stability to get somethin' goin'. (sighs heavily) We make a pretty good team, you and me. You didn't step on my toes once. - You know you're... - What? - Quite... - What? - I'm sorry, it's just... - Yeah, it's okay. You looked interested. - With my daughter comin' here soon... - It's okay. (rattling) (doorknob turns) You go be good daddy now. (rattling) (door shuts) - [Luke] My dad always said it's better to piss a woman off for a night than for a lifetime. Like always, I wish he was out of my head. The thing is, Monica was the sharpest one in the tenement. She didn't deserve to get caught up with someone like me. (low ominous tones) (soft whispering) (sick squishing) (groans) Shit. (eerie tones) - [Explorer] We knew from the moment we saw its fleshy nest we must destroy it. I dragged it to the soft ground using a whaling hook, where we buried it immediately. - What a weak, miserable, pathetic excuse for a... (phone beeps) - First entry for a personal interest case. Attempting to assess the value of an untitled journal. Something about an explorer trapped in the woods. If it is a true journal, he's clearly going insane from panic. - [Electronic Voice] Your device storage is full. - What? I should have tons. (phones beeps) First entry for a personal interest case. Attempting to assess the value of an untitled journal. The text appears to be handwritten in ink. First journal entry for Luke Harding. This is the first entry for a personal interest case. I'm trying to figure out, assessing the value of a book with no title that I think might be priceless. His ship landed in 1903. (phones beeps) There were 20 in his original party. Some kind of residue, I had enough of this fuckin', what the hell was I just saying? God damnit. (thudding) (soft chittering) (tense tones) That thing in the bathroom couldn't have been real. I just need some sleep. (thudding) (soft chirping) (thudding) (odd warbling) (soft slithering) (curtain rattles) (Luke groans) (dark tones) (squishing) (strange whispering) (jarring notes) - [Explorer] Page 18. My companions don't seem to be showing any symptoms, but I know my mind has been poisoned. I feel my memories shattering until I can't trust my own thoughts. I can't trust anyone. (pounding) - [Luke] I'm coming. (locks rattle) - You must be Luke Harding. - You're with Fairweather? - We came for the package. - Excuse my eager friend, but we are here for business. - It's on the table. You don't look familiar. - You do. Do you work for Fairweather much? - Only once, but it's been a long job. (tense tones) (jarring notes) - My God. You've only had it for one day? - Yeah. Wait, what? Look, I just want that thing gone. - I'm afraid it's a little late for that. Thank you for your time. (electronic whirring) - Where are you goin'? We had a deal. - We came for a package, not this coloring book. - That's bullshit. Look, I just need that money. - You have any problems, take it up with Fairweather. Hey, why don't buy some sleeves. - I'm really very sorry, Mr. Harding. But believe me, there's nothing more we can do for you. - God damnit. (phone rings) Come on, answer, you bastard. - [Jules] Hello. - Fairweather. - [Jules] Yeah, this is Jules Fairweather. - It's Luke Harding. Your men came, then refused the package. - [Jules] I see. Did you by chance open the book? - Well, yeah. - [Jules] Ah, that would explain things from my end. - Look, I just need that money. I don't care about some stupid book. - [Jules] Shit, Harding. Let's just say that's about to change. - I could snipe him, easy. - The man's performed a miracle. And all you can think to do is kill him? (phone rings) Mr. Lamont. - Do you have it? - It's inside, but it's been compromised. - Tragic, but acceptable. - The guy is on page 18. - [Lamont] Pardon? - It's true, sir. Page 18. - [Lamont] In one night? - [Jacob] Of my own eyes. I saw it. - Well, that changes everything. - [Jules] Just remember to remain seated. We've lost many good people to the hooks. - What hooks? - [Jules] Well, they come with the book. - What? - [Jules] The rest will come from you. You just gotta get to the ending. I doubt you'll survive, but who knows. - I don't want him touched. Observe and get closer. I want a full study. - [Jules] As much as I'd like to break out my violin and play the sad tune you wanna hear, I'm in over my head, too. And we need to work together to get out of it. - We had a simple deal. I want you to come and pick up this god damn book. - [Jules] No advice I give will make any sense to ya right now. We're just gonna have to wait until you've read more. - I've hacked into his phone. It's recording a conversation right now. - Anything unusual. - [Luke] Do not send those two monkeys over here anymore. (static crackles) (phone beeps) - It sounds like he's talking to flies. - I imagine he does. That's what I expected. (unsettling tones) - It was at that moment I decided, whether it was a possessed book, a toxic hallucinogenic, or they were testing some elaborate con on me, I would treat this like any other case. I keep leaving notes to myself. To help with my sudden lapses in my memory. I would use the explorer's own words to track him and plot out his journey. The creature was so hideous, their instinct was to bury it. Then the madness set in. Hallucinations, memory loss, and paranoia. But the explorer only had a feather and ink to try and document his experience. Whereas I could separate and organize his random thoughts. (electronic beeping) I just need to keep track. I began with two companions, a lantern, a length of rope, and a knife. Maybe this substance is made from some rare plant. I had to get to know him. How can an explorer simply bury the discovery of a lifetime? And then it hit me. The one thing the explorer was doing that was out of character. To keep such immaculate records, he had never once mentioned this mysterious substance. What if he had brought it back. What if this isn't just a journal of the creature? This is its tomb. (eerie notes) That is, assuming that it's dead. (ominous tones) In these brief flashes, somehow, it all just comes together. And I know exactly where he is. And what he needs to do. - [Woman] I hid your keys. (tense music) - [Luke] And what he needs to do. - [Woman] I hid your keys. (rattling) - Hello? - [Girl] I hid your keys. - Daddy. - Daddy! (suspenseful music) (girl giggling) Jesus. (Luke sighs) Sorry. Hi. - Come on in. - [Angelina] Okay, sorry. (door slams) (low tense music) - So, how was the bus? - Yeah, um. Sorry I was late. - That's okay. (sighs) I'll give you as much space as I can. You come and go as you like. And you're really on route to someplace else, and you just stopped by to sting me, there's a firebox wedged behind the bookcase there. What little stuff of value I've got is in it. I'm not saying that I think that's what you came for, just that I'd understand. And I wouldn't recommend bringing any guys home. Sorry, but that's the best I can offer. - [Angelina] That's okay. - How's the couch? - Yeah, it's comfy, I guess. - I'm gonna go take a nap. - Yep. (Angelina sighs) (Luke sighs) (foreboding music) (phone rings) (soft whispering) - [Luke] Hello? - Luke. How's the apartment holding up? - [Luke] It's doin' great. - Great. Um, listen. I've been getting a lot of calls lately. - [Luke] What kind of calls? - (sighs) Mrs. Oats. She's always seeing things around here. And I figured, since we have a private detective in the building, I might as well give him a call and ask him if he wants to... - [Luke] I hear somethin'. You're cookin', aren't you? - Yeah, just lunch. - [Luke] Same plans for dinner? - Is this an invitation? - [Luke] My place? - Yeah. (laughs softly) (eerie tones) (whipping) (door slams) (phone rings) - Yeah? - [Jules] You're still alive. Damn good thing there's no gambling in hell or I'd be a poor man right now. (laughs) - I don't know what you're on about. (mumbling) - Lamont must be pissed a moron like you comes along... - Look... - And passes page 40. - Then why don't you give my five grand. And I'll take it today. - [Jules] (groans) You won't be goin' anywhere. You probably already tried to leave a dozen times. Walked around in some daze, only to end up back in front of the book. It doesn't work. And it only wears ya out quicker. - I keep seeing things. - [Jules] Ah, most of it's just in your head now. You just need to get to the end of the story. - What's so special about the ending? - [Jules] That's what I wanted to find out. I stole the book to harness its power. Just remember, all this shit started the moment you opened that book. And it'll finish when you're done reading it. - Just read the book. The voice spoke as if it were my own thoughts, constantly trying to trick me. Okay. - You miserable little pencil-pecker. - Fuck you, dad. - Did you just tell your father to fuck off? And who the hell is this? (suspenseful music) (tense tones) - So, today, I can go to Julie's place. She's this girl I met on the bus. And she said she's gonna help me with my resume and stuff, so. - Yeah, great. - Yeah. Are there any openings at your office? - No. - Maybe? Nothing, like in the mail room or... - No, no, no, no. I mean, I'm not an accountant. - Oh. Okay, so what do you do then? - [Luke] Uh, surveillance, security. - What, like a private eye? Why wouldn't you you tell me you were a private investigator? It's, like, badass. - Just wanted to set a good example. - By pretending to be an accountant? (laughs) Here, I'll take it out for you, I'm out. - Don't you have to finish gettin' dressed first? - I am finished. - Ain't that a bra? - Well, like, it acts like one, but it's like a shirt. Too, kinda. - Can you zip it up, and just pretend that's how you're gonna look today? - Yeah. Fine. Oh, um, thanks. You know, for the couch. - No worries. - Okay. See ya. - Sorry. - Fuck, man. This job usually has caviar and shit. Why the hell are we bothering with this nobody? - Because he's got street smarts, like you. - (laughs) Yeah, you're right. All this time they've been dickin' around with these Harvard grad types like you. (guitar music) (knocking) - [Edwin] Oh, hold on. - But it takes a man like me to get the job done. (gun fires) (groaning) (thudding) (Edwin groans) - Help. - It's true. - [Edwin] Help. - All this time Lamont's been trying to lure it like it's some kind of princess. And the fact is, - Help me. - It's nothing but a soulless, primitive monster. (Edwin gags) - Exactly. See, if it were me, I would just pretend to read the thing. - How 'bout that. Two minutes on the job, and you've already solved the whole thing. - Oh, one more thing. As a piece of advice. Shit goes down, walk away. Safety first. - You're gonna be around a long time, Boston. - Oh for fuck's sakes. (sighs) - About this equipment. Did you have family in the Cold War? - [Boston] What? - Exactly what I thought. (drill whirs) (drill hums) (water splashes) - Jesus. - God damnit, am I thirsty. (sighs) (can spraying) - Nice camera placement, Boston. - [Luke] Note to self, I already have water. - Okay, this place gets a C plus for sandwich fixins. - Fuck, I'm thirsty. (jarring notes) - Find me. (tearing) (groaning) - Something's happening. - [Luke] Fuck. (groans) (unsettling tones) - That was, uh, fascinating. (eerie tones) (haunting tones) - [Explorer] I have a rope, a lantern, and a knife. (sharp whooshing) (dark tones) (Jacob sighs) (creepy tones) (Jacob gags) (Jacob gasps for air) - What? No mustard? This place is spooky. - This is all in your head. Fuck. (speaking in foreign language) - Hey, dad, remember when I told you about Julie? - Pleased to meet you, Mr. Harding. - Yeah, you too. - We were just gonna watch a movie. So, I didn't think you'd mind. - Yeah, okay. Well, you two have a good time. - Dad? - Yeah? - Julie is my special friend. - Well, that I didn't know. You and me are gonna have a talk. - If you have a problem with this, I can just go. - Hey, my daughter's sexuality is none of my business. But if you wanna sit that close to her, it is. Now, my daughter is a very special person with a lot of dreams and ambitions. And I don't want her hookin' up with some... - Dad! - Person with one thing on their mind. So what are your intentions? - Um. Noble. We're just getting to know each other. Seeing if we click or not. - Well, I don't think you have to sit that close to do that, but so be it. You're outta here by 11:30. - Yes, sir. - [Luke] Okay, enjoy the movie. - Thanks. - I'm so sorry. - Oh my God. That was so cute. (laughs) - That was not cute. That was so embarrassing. - Don't be. Hey. He puts you on that same pedestal that I want to. (faint speaking) (foreboding tones) (electronic beeping) - [Luke] Where was I? I could feel exposure to the book boring holes in my memory as it assaulted me with my past. God damnit, where are my keys? So you might wanna wear gloves when you read it. As for me, it was a little late. So I decided to meet this thing head-on. (eerie tones) (Luke screams) - [John] Just as your notes predict, here you are. Welcome to the future, Mr. Harding. (door slams) (unsettling tones) - Dad, are you home? I need the shower. (disturbing tones) Hello? Is someone there? (low growling Dad, is that you? - Where are my fuckin' keys? (growling) (tense tones) - [John] Stay calm, Mr. Harding. You're experiencing a vision from the book. - Do I know you? - [John] No. But I feel like I know you. And thanks to your notes, I've captured this. - [Luke] What is it? - [John] It spawned the moment I reached page 18. And you've already warned me what's coming next. I've been following your story. Quietly. On the shadows. You have an advantage. I believe the book chooses those it wants to include in its pages. It chose you. - How can I stop it? - [John] Depends if we can trust each other. How do I know you're not a manifestation of the book? Trying to manipulate me. You see, I already know your story. Tell me mine. (sharp whooshing) - What's wrong with your face? - It's okay, Luke. (jarring tones) You're not even here. - Yeah, so that's pretty much everything, you know, about me, that I've got for first date confessions. You all right? - Yeah. - [Boston] How's it goin'? - Are we going to the gym? - They have one here? - Thanks for comin' over. - Thanks for the dinner. And the wine. - He's a good listener. - Luke, I had a lot of fun tonight and, um, I look forward to date number two. - Me too. - There's something too innocent about him. Look at her face. She's already worried about hurting him. - Of course. Anyway, that was nice. - Yeah. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - No chance. (Boston scoffs) - Hey dad. Is your date over already? - [Luke] It wasn't much of a date. - Hey dad. (sighs) I didn't have much of a date either. - Why? Did she do somethin'? - No. I did something. (laughs softly) You know, you might find this hard to believe, but I'm actually the one that the parents warn their kids about. Julie would never admit it, but I know she's only going out with me out of pity. - She's only gonna feel that way about you if you keep tellin' her to. - Are you giving me advice? - You may not think that I know much about relationships, but I can get ya started. - [Angelina] I don't know, like, I just, like, I don't know what to say or what to do. (sighs) She's so confusing. - Is there music on this thing? - [Angelina] Yeah. - [Luke] All right. - Boston, why don't you hit the sheets. I'll take the first shift. - What? - The most important thing that you need to know about women is that they love to dance. (soft pop music) - No, I don't dance. - [Luke] Prove it. - [Angelina] Dad, seriously? - Well yeah, I mean, we're the only two people in this room. - [Angelina] I can't believe you. - Come on. You ready? (Angelina laughs) - [Angelina] I don't know what to do. - I wish my dad would dance like that. - Please go to sleep. - Now, you take Julie dancing. And you're gonna prove to her that you know how to have fun. Yeah, there we go. (Angelina laughs) (low tense tones) - Just grab the bottle of wine. That's what you always end up picking. - I ain't thirsty. It's just that, (scratching) (soft squeaking) can't you hear that? - Hear what? (scratching) - Scratchin'. - Please, I don't hear nothin' but you. Bitching about nothing. - (sighs) I'm callin' Monica. - Will you leave her alone. We ain't got rats. We ain't got raccoons. There's only one thing I get around here. - Yeah, what's that? (soft squeaking) (jarring notes) - Irritated by the fucking worthless sound of your voice. (dark tones) (phone rings) (Luke sighs) - Yeah? - [Jules] Damnit, Luke, I gotta say, I thought you were a gonner. I even let myself rot. - Can you gimme somethin'? What do you already know about the book? - [Jules] I'll tell you one thing, you get to the end, you'll be the safest man on the planet. Lamont will keep you protected for that piece of information. He's the only guy to survive an encounter with the book. But we ain't exactly on speaking terms anymore. (tense tones) - [Explorer] And although I was grateful to have two companions, I just couldn't shake the feeling that I'd begun this journey alone. (unsettling tones) - [Angelina] Dad! - Jesus. - Did you not hear me calling you? Oh my God, you get so spaced out when you read that, what? - Listen, you need to promise me you're not gonna read this thing. - Dad, you literally, you give me this speech every 20 minutes. I don't wanna read your stupid book. I was just trying to show you my new outfit, that's all. - Well, you look beautiful. - Thanks. Okay, well, you need to shower, because Julie's gonna be here at 6:00, so. - Me? - Yeah, you've been festering in that bedroom for too long. You stink. - I need you to make sure that you stay away from that thing. - Dad, I don't wanna read your stupid book. Are serious? Okay, I've gotta clean up out here. Can you just hurry up? - Fine. (uneasy tones) (water splashing) (suspenseful music) (dark notes) (panting) (jarring notes) (phone rings) (dark tones) - Hello? (flies buzzing) Hello? What the hell? (unsettling music) (scrubbing) - See, I didn't kill my husband. He turned into my uncle. I mean, he literally turned into my uncle. And my uncle's already dead. - Whatever you say, Mrs. Oats. - Ms. Oates, if you don't mind. (knocking) (tense tones) - Good evening, Mr. Harding. - Gifts. - The roses are for Angelina, but the chocolates are for you. - You are so sweet. (smooches) Thank you. - Butterin' up the old man. - What'd you get, dad? (dark tones) - Uh, chocolates. - Can I have one? - Yeah. - Thanks. - You drive here? - No, I took a cab. - Good, I'll even pay for the cab fare home. - Oh no. - No. - No, no. - Dad, it's fine. - It's okay. It's okay. (grotesque squishing) - Well, just promise me you'll go easy on the drinks. - We'll be too busy dancing, don't worry about it. - Good. Care for a chocolate? - Sure. Thanks. - Bye, dad. - Bye. (door slams) (locks click) (jarring tones) - I hid your keys, and you haven't even tried to find them yet. - I can't play with you. - At least page 70, not that I was looking too close. - I'm sorry. Maybe whatever you are was somehow real. But you are not my daughter. (pounding) - I'm real, I'm... - Relax. That's why you bring me in. I'm always one step ahead. (tense tones) Who the hell am I talking to? (unsettling music) (phone beeps) (dark tones) - God, no. No! Angelina, no! (sharp whooshing) (strange sighing) - This isn't just your story anymore. And she's such a bad girl. I blame her parents. (tense tones rise) - Sir. We've finally reestablished communication with Jacob and Boston. - Good. - They're acting very peculiar. - Really? Put them on. (electronic whirring) Oh my God. (dance music) - Hey, you okay? - [Angelina] I'm gettin' kinda hot. - Okay, let's take a break. - Hello, sir. - Hello, gentlemen. How is everything? - He's been very active on the book. - Oh, I have somethin' to report. On Dave the jack-off standing right next to you. - Pardon? - He kept tellin' us there's a third person in the room with us. - I see. - That shit ain't funny, Dave. (dance music) - Do you want a beer? - No, no, I'll have one in a little bit. Thanks. - You have such beautiful eyes. - We would appreciate a certain professionalism. - Of course. Dave. Apologize for your poor sense of humor. - I'm sorry. - Do you think we're a fun couple? - I'm having a fun time. - Me too. (dance music) (crowd chattering) (music slows) (eerie tones) - Wait, I love this song. We so have to dance again. - Thank you, sir. Things are just getting a little tense around here. - Well, I'm glad everything's on track. I look forward to your next updates. (unsettling music) It's happening. - Jacob, you gotta try this. It's all like 3D and stuff. Oh whoa. - [Jacob] I find it disorientating. - [Boston] Oh, it's so cool, though. (laughs) Oh wow, it's so, wow. (heavy breathing) - You had a point. Safety first. (door slams) (music grows more tense) (Edwin growls) (eyeballs squishing) (Boston screams) (phone rings) Mr. Lamont, if you are able to hear this message, I wanted you to know, I quit. Vacate. Now. Get out. - Okay, okay. - Okay. - [Angelina] Fuck. - [Jacob] Thank you. - Fuck you, bitch. - Driver. Get me to the airport - Jerk. Now. - Prick, man. - Tango? (Angelina giggles) You've got it, girl. (tense music) (heavy breathing) (girls giggle) - I'll give you a big dip, you ready? - Yes. (girls laugh) (shushing) (demon growls) (demon grumbles) - Say goodnight to your dad for me? - Yeah. Hey dad. - [Demon] Find the keys. - Hi. - Hello, dear. - Is everything okay? - Oh, why yes. We're just about to have tea. Why don't you join us? (gun clicks) - Dad? - [Demon] Fuckin' keys. - You didn't ask where my date went. (ominous tones) - Did you really think I would stay because you hid my keys? I'd have torn my arms off to get away from you and your mother. You're one that I hated. Have you found my keys? I look at you. And I hate myself. For creating something so worthless! Where are my fucking keys? (Angelina gasps) (phone dials) - So, we're just gonna sit here and have a nice cup of tea. (phone rings) - I know who you think we are, but we are not demons. - You are demons. Oh, you may not know it yet, but it'll happen. (phone rings) (gun clicks) (Monica screams) Oh dear. - It's not loaded! (Mrs. Oats cries out) (furniture crashes) - Hey Jules, I need you to call me back. Look, I think when we were at the club someone slipped me something. (suspenseful music) (sick squishing) (tense tones) - [Explorer] It's not until I reached the last few pages of this journal I know what I need to do. (dark notes) (thudding) (crunching) (squishing) I must stop this story. (unsettling music) (man groans) (flesh squelching) Or will the creature find another way to preserve itself? - [Luke] He killed them. He killed all of them. Was that really his solution? Was it supposed to be mine? (phone rings) - [Jules] Luke, you're so close. Just one last demon to kill. Angelina. She's in the closet. So finish the book, please. My time is up, I've just gotta know now. - What a god damn mess. - Didn't even let the poor bastard hang up the phone. - Fairweather! The explorer's ending wasn't enough. The creature wanted me to kill. But violence hadn't exactly worked out for the explorer. How do I reason with something that really thinks it's my baby girl? I'd have to face something I'd intended to take to the grave. - When I was a kid, I went and I... - Hid my keys. - Yeah. (dark tons) (unsettling music) (jarring notes) - You can't find them! You have to see me! - You are not my daughter! - I was playing. And I hid your keys. I guess, I don't know, I thought it would be funny or something. But then you started to get mad. (demon breathes heavily) And you started to get upset. And then you just, you left. - I'm sorry, kid. Your father died in prison when you were two. - (gasps) Figures. - It was your fault. I just couldn't take living with you anymore. - Why wouldn't mom say anything? - I told your mother not to tell you. - Yeah, is that why? You just couldn't stand me? - No. I found something. - What did you find? - Love letters. Not from me. - I know it wasn't right, but of all the things I've been, your father was the one thing that I couldn't let go of. - Dad, I'm really sorry. - Dad? You'd still call me that? - You'll always be my dad to me. - No. It'll hurt. - (laughs softly) It won't hurt. (demon groans in pain) - What happened? - What's happened is you two have just made history. - Jesus Christ. - Sorry. I didn't mean to startle you. - You must be Lamont. - Yes. Although, I've told you that several times already. Not to worry. The effects will wear off shortly. - What happened to us? - What happened is that instead of one survivor, we have two survivors. So rather than your having to split the reward, I'll simply double it. - Oh my God. - Of course, you'll have to surrender all the recordings you made. - Sure. - Good. I look forward to seeing them. - [Luke] The creature has found rest now. For how long, who knows? I wish I could tell you more about the ending. But I had help. - So, I meant to ask you? - Yes? - [Luke] So I only have 1/2 the story. And my memory of it all is fading fast. - If we can just get you to sign some of these. - [Luke] And there's some mercy in knowing Angelina will forget as well. (door clicks shut) - [Dave] We'll have some more forms for you to sign later. - Oh my God, Luke. Mrs. Oats went crazy. She killed some people, and then... - I'm so glad you're okay. - It's gonna be... (Monica gasps) (Monica sobs) It's gonna be okay. - (sighs) Is that it? - That's it, John. I hear you're a real miracle worker. - Well, if the book does what you say it will, then thank you. - Oh, John. Mind the hooks. - [Luke] Private journal from a Luke Harding to a mister, well, I didn't ask your name. So I'll just call you the surgeon. You haven't met me yet, but believe it or not, I've met you. And if you trust me, I can help you change your story. (unsettling music) (knocking) - John. - Anthony. I've been expecting you. (jarring tones) (eerie notes) (haunting music) (soft chant singing) (music intensifies)
