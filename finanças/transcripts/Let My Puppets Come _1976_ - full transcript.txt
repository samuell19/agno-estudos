Goddamn right. - Well, there's only one way to make that kind of money in 24 hours. Make a porno flick. A dirty movie. You'll clean up. - But we don't know nothing about movie making. - Aw, with some technical assistance, you can put together a dynamite fuck film. What you need is lots of raunchy sex, plenty of sucking and fucking. Yeah, maybe even a plot. Terrific Red. Nah, nah, nah. You need plenty of hardcore sex. Close ups. Penetration. - Whoa! - Moaning and groaning. Oh yeah. Now. Here's an idea. You got this girl, see, and she's all alone, practically. Another lonely Saturday night. Stood up again. Men are so horrid.

Excuse me, I'm a little embarrassed about this, but who do I see about taking nude photographs. Ooh. - Well, you came to the right place, honey. Is there anymore at home like you? - Well, I- - I don't see him. Girls get a load of what just walked in. Oh my goodness. - Oh my god. - Yeah.

How do you like it, Gramps? - Oh, I like it like that, but what about the pictures? Ooh, oh, my heart. Oh, that's nice. Yahoo! - Here we go again! I got this side. Well, how'd you like it? - Well, it's a swell fantasy, Gramps, but it's just not believable. The audience will never buy it. What do you mean? It happened to me twice just last week. - Ooh, ooh, I got an idea for the flick. Yeah, here it comes. - Well, everyone's been in a hospital and had those fantasies, thinking of the nurses, whacking off in bed. I never whack off in bed. I think it's depraved. - Nah, fuck you. Well, anyway, here's the idea. Guy's just waking up from an operation. See? He's groggy. Just coming to, see. And he starts calling, see. Nurse, nurse. Nurse. It's all right, sir. Nurse is here. What is it? - I'm sinking fast. - Yes, I know. - I only have a few minutes. - Poor thing. - I'm so horny. Help me. Please. Oh, you poor sick thing. Well, Nurse McPringle never shrinks from a challenge, no matter how big. Yes, nurse, ah. Yes! I'm coming! Oh, that's it. - What's going on in there? - Oops! Some poor devil is suffering. - Doctor, who was that masked lady. I wanted to thank her. - Why sir, that was no masked lady. That was the head nurse. Down. Down boy, down, big fella. Whoa! Whoa! My idea was right. - Now, that's box office, I tell ya. A first class motion picture. Gummy Pachino. I've an idea for a picture. A porno monster thriller about a blowfish. Who sucks off on weary swimmers. Can't you see that fucking fish? - We'll title it as Deep Trout. - Gentlemen, we're just floundering around here. It seems clear we've reached the point where we need technical assistance. I know just the man you need. Give me that phone. Person to person to Federico Gepetto. Met Gepetto on the beach at Anzio during the big one. We surrendered to each other immediately, and we've been fast friends ever since. Huh? Well, prado to you to. Hey, Gepetto! Oh, it's me, Grandpa. Yeah, it sure has been a long time. Listen, I got a job for you to do. Hop on a plane and get over here. And hurry. Ciao. Hey, you guys, now all you need is a first-class cameraman. I know just where we can dig one up. Listen to me, all of you. I have to be in this film. I wanna be the star. I need a chance. Give me the chance. - I'm sure you're aware, Miss Bliss, that we can't hire an actress without an audition. I understand. Come and get it, boys! Oh, baby! Wait a minute!

We know each other? Sure, from the old days. You were directing Army training films. I was a key grip. - Ah, Army training films. Now, those were actors who understood the meaning of discipline. Hi-yah! Hi-yah! Cat of nine tails, it's an enforcer. Hmm, hmm? We ship anywhere. - No, listen, Lash, we need your help. I'm working with a bunch of greenhorns on a fuck film. We need a great cameraman. How about it? No. I'm through with the business. - For old time's sake, piece of the picture? Never. I'm not even for points. I have been pushing these prurient interests, amorous bullshit, for years now, and I couldn't be happier. Get into plastics, kid, you'll make a fortune. But the actors need you. They need that professional touch. Sorry. - They need inspiration and organization. Forget it, sweetheart. - More than anything else, Lash, they need discipline. - Why didn't you say so? I'm your boy. Get me a cab. Call me a taxi. - You're a taxi. Hi-yah, hi-ya! - Gepetto! - Grandpa! Ah, and this must be Pinocchio.
