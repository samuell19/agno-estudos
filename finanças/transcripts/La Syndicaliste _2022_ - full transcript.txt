You've reached the police. I clean Ms. Kearney's house, and when I got there, the lady was tied to a chair. Is she injured? There's like a triangle on her stomach and a knife in... In what? Between her legs. - Where are you going, sir? - I'm Maureen Kearney's husband. Alto, down! Is the woman bleeding? No. The knife... It's the handle that was inserted... Mr. Hugo? Your wife is in there, but you'll need to wait, please. - I'll go get the rest. - Yes, thank you. - Are you Mr. Hugo? - Yes. You can go in now. No internal injuries. Only the knife? No other penetration? Sorry. You can get dressed. Do you have a pen and paper? I want to write down everything that happened. - Of course. - Thank you. Around 6:30 or 7:00, bathroom, putting on my makeup. Suddenly, a hat is shoved down over my head, covering my eyes. I felt like there was a gun to my back. He made me sit down on a stool and put tape over my mouth. And then... It's easier to fire us than the men. It's been weeks. The manager won't negotiate. He's refusing a redundancy plan, but I'm here to find a solution. If he fires us, what will we do? Does he want us to turn tricks to feed our kids? I'll demand you get retraining, and I promise you won't be abandoned. Why should we believe you? When I make promises, they're not empty. I fight to keep them! CFDT Union Delegate Head, European Workers' Council What did your Socialist pals do? The deal with the Greens? It won't help us. 12% of voters support them. - We have to talk... - I can't, she's expecting me. It's the reason we went to Japan. I met with the Prime Minister... Yes? - I'm not late? - We're done here. He assured me he had high hopes for our efforts to block China. So, Maureen, how was Hungary? What's the trouble there? He's laying off the women. Their output is lower. Are they less productive? Less profitable. Since they never take time off, even when they're sick... there are accidents, manufacturing defects... Why not see a doctor? Without any health coverage, public or private? Women at our subsidiary can't be fired like that. They need a redundancy plan, retraining... OK, fine. Luc, do a study on that, and I'll present it at the next board meeting. Thank you, Ma'am. The women stick together. When two women work closely, they're not doing their jobs, but sticking together? Pathetic, Dumont. I'll handle the study personally, Ma'am. Thank you. Do you have a minute, Maureen? Yes, I... It'll be quick, my kids are coming for lunch. This is it, Maureen, Sarkozy is sacking me, and appointing my successor before the election. Who is it? Not some "hysteric in a skirt", to quote his private secretary. Not Oursel, I hope? Luc has been working his contacts for weeks. He has no experience. It's not possible! He's not made to be on top. Since when do we demand that men be qualified? It won't be fun working with him. Are you up to it? Someone has to keep him in line. That's reassuring. You know I'll always be there to help you. I love your earrings. A gift from my husband. All these years, and I can't tell what you're holding. Are you joking? She's a born bluffer. Under that sweet exterior. No table talk! Are you in or out? - I fold. - Me too. How's it going at Areva? All good since Fukushima? Spare us the ecology sermon, Fiona. She's trying to distract me. You have to admit we trashed the planet for them. We're leaving them a mess. You're joining in, too? Areva employs more than 50,000 people. My job is to defend them. As for the game, I'm all in. I fold. Show us. I'm sure you've got nothing. I knew it. It's just a game... Take your 30 euros. Your money's radioactive. You're a pain tonight. Someday you have to tell me what you hold against me. I'm working on it. It keeps vibrating. All of Areva is calling you. First up this evening, Anne Lauvergeon, CEO of Areva. It was announced yesterday: Anne Lauvergeon will not continue to lead Areva. There's a political uproar, with many denouncing the president's decision. Her replacement is an unknown. Completely unknown: Luc Oursel, a man with a low profile. The president calls him a choice for continuity at Areva. Let's hear more about him and his appointment... The Labor Confederation doesn't usually talk nice to management, but I admire you, Ms. Lauvergeon. You led us out of an era of stigma, when nuclear power seemed outdated. We really enjoyed working alongside you, and we're proud of what we built together. Thank you, Jean-Pierre. Thank you. It was wonderful working with you for so many years. And the bonds we created together are strong. Today I'd like to thank the woman who spared no effort to defend your interests. A woman who sometimes sees management as an adversary, but never as the enemy. I'm talking about Maureen, of course. It was precious having her by my side as I faced all those men in suits! I remember when you first burst into my office. - 1999, right? - Yes. Newly elected union rep and not intimidated at all, she was demanding of everyone, and I knew right away we'd work well together. And we did. Thank you. I'll miss our Saturday breakfasts. Those choux pastries! The choux pastries... Thank you. Dear Anne, what can I say... You can count on us to look after this wonderful place. Those who know me also know I'm not about to let my guard down. The struggle continues! Long live Areva! Good-bye, Luc. I'll be back. This is my home. That jerk won't be in my chair for long. Good-bye, Anne. Thank you for everything. - See you soon. - Yes, soon. Ms. Kearney. Pardon me, Mr. Oursel is expecting you in 10 minutes. Very well. Ms. Kearney. Have a seat. I hear you're running for re-election as union rep? Yes. That's a wonderful idea! What will that be, your fifth term? Sixth. labor relations are one of my priorities. And I'll be thrilled to keep working with you, constructively. My father. A navy colonel. Like him, I have a sense of duty, and I'll do my utmost to right Areva's course. It's my mission. I'll be visiting the Latina plant in a few days. You could come with me. To Rome? If it's to discuss the future for Areva's employees, - why not? With pleasure. - Excellent. We're going to innovate together. And we've got work to do! I'll see you out? You know our gender equity seminars? Yes, I'm very committed to them. Which is why you cut them from the budget? I have to make cuts to overcome the bad management... So you slash the program to bring women into management? It's a proposal, not set in stone. We'll discuss it in Rome over a grappa! I don't drink. Keep the grappa, and I keep the seminars. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. I didn't mention it, but I was re-elected union rep. Weren't you gonna pack it in? Your new boss is a nightmare. That's why! He's dangerous. If I do nothing, it'll be a disaster. Wonder Woman hasn't turned in her costume. Wonder Woman, with her hot pants and magic lasso. I'm better than that, no? So no changing jobs? Two more years and I quit. It's the last time. Fine. I'll do more concerts and keep paying into my retirement... Maureen! Did you seen Philippe today? - What's wrong? - I emailed you. He said crazy stuff about his colleagues at his review. HR almost suspended him. Sorry, I've had no time since Lauvergeon left. This is urgent. He's burned out. I have to answer this. Ms. Kearney. I have information you should know about Areva. Who are you? I work for EDF. Call me Tiresias. Ms. Kearney. Your phone, please. What do you do at EDF? I gave my life to EDF. When Proglio came in, I was pushed out. Lauvergeon is dismissed and you show up? Don't take me for a fool. Proglio wants to take Areva down. He wants the nuclear sector in EDF's grip. - That's not news. - But he's about to succeed. He's negotiating in secret with the Chinese. What for? To build plants with them. And sink Areva. Do you have proof? This is a memorandum of understanding with a Chinese consortium. Give it to the media, they'd be interested. - I don't trust journalists. - But you trust me? You're an agitator, and you know people. And if the socialists win, you've got an in. CGNPC to access EDF's expertise in nuclear plants in France. CGNPC to participate in new EDF nuclear projects in France. Good morning, Ms. Kearney. - She's waiting for you. - Thank you. Good morning, Anne. So, trouble with Oursel? - What's going on? - Well... His new crazy idea is to partner with EDF and the Chinese to build low-cost plants. He dreams of winning big international contracts. Behind our backs, of course. It's not his idea. He's the one behind it. Oursel's a minor player. The enemy is Proglio. He's the predator. He's power hungry. EDF is too small. He wants to be the world leader in nuclear. He's obsessed, and won't give up. And he'll love destroying what I built. A deal with the Chinese will be awful for our employees. We have to loop the politicians in. Now? With the elections coming up? Don't dream. None of them have the balls to get involved. Especially with no proof. Where's this from? A guy at EDF who hates Proglio. You never had any idea? You can't imagine the dirty tricks he played on me... It's nuts you got your hands on this. If I can prove it's authentic, it could be explosive. If you reveal that, you'll be on the front lines. Without me to protect you, you'll be attacked. You know that? Are you prepared? I was starting to get soft... At 8 p.m. exactly we're showing the results. We estimate that François Hollande has been elected president with 51.9 percent of the vote. You could wear a tie. I took off my union vest. When you meet a minister, you dress like a minister. This thing isn't signed. You're worried about nothing. If they sign it, we lose everything. It's a real risk for our jobs. Frankly Maureen, the real emergency is finishing Areva's first EPR in Finland. There have been delays, it's true. 2.6 billion euros in penalties. An arm, a leg, and two kidneys! So you sacrifice Areva? Fukushima complicated nuclear energy. If EDF can help you through these difficult times, you should celebrate. It's good that French expertise is marketable in China! And the next step? The Chinese build here and our guys are on the dole? I understand, and thank you for alerting me. But no one wants Areva or its employees to suffer. Who told you? Proglio? Trust me. We need to globalize. France already has nuclear plants everywhere! But I will protect Areva's know-how and jobs. That is certain. OK, yes. Let's talk later. Thank you. Lauvergeon's still your boss. You're joined at the hip. Go get me a plate instead of talking nonsense. A present from my mole at EDF. It's a carbon copy of the Areva brochure for Seoul. They reformatted it and replaced the blue with red, to look more Chinese. Damn it, you're burning them! Here, hold this. If it's not Lauvergeon, it's China! Relax a little. Gilles, this is really bad. Go on, answer! Tell her to come over! We need more sausages anyway. Maureen works like a dog, 24/7. It's been 24/7 for 20 years. Frankly, isn't this paradise? In a few years we can move here. Slow down a little. Is Maureen on board? - Maureen? - Yes? Do you think about slowing down? Me, slow down? I don't drive fast. What is the Labor Federation up to? The "questions to management"? The complaints to the minister? We've asked about the Chinese projects for weeks, and you won't answer! You don't understand corporate strategy! You're selling off our technology to China. I'm no fool. You're plotting with Lauvergeon to undermine me. You're paranoid! You see her everywhere! Is it exciting to think you're important? Do not touch me! Be careful. Stop now, or I'll take you to court. I have support that you don't. ...pain in the ass. - Please, sir... - Sorry, Ms. Kearney, I'm in a hurry. - Not interested. - It's your job to save jobs! - You're not interested? - No. Please read this! Our nuclear sector is being sold off to the Chinese. OK, Maureen. I'll read it soon, I promise. Call me. Let's talk. - OK. - Thank you. Things are heating up. It's Montebourg! "Stop pamphleting the MPs. "It's awkward for me..." - The minister is annoyed. - So? If he's worked up, something's happening. Be careful, this is the big leagues... If it's out of your league, I'll handle it on my own. Henri Proglio here... We need to talk since you're intent on blowing up the nuclear industry. I'm not blowing anything up. What's your ten-year vision? Be sweet and spare me Lauvergeon's old ideas. I'm not "sweet", and I definitely won't be "sweet" with you! Excellent. So I'd like your enlightened opinion. But I forgot: you're not even an engineer! Take my advice: stick to your English classes. What are you doing here? Dad called me from Le Havre... Why did you come? It's nothing. I owe you for the times you came to the station for me! Go home, I'm fine. This'll take forever. It's OK. I filed a police report last week. I noticed a guy parked in a car at the house all day. You think he was watching you? Maybe. The next day he followed me, so I took his plate. Are you sure? You're not imaging it? You're such a pain. Fiona! I'm sorry. I'm a little tense... You're always tense, and you never want help. The coffee's gross. Want one? Ms. Kearney? You can come in. I'll wait for you. Apply yourself, sweetie! Hitting them into the net won't get him to Roland-Garros! Did I tell you I'm writing a book? I'm settling my score with those morons. You're sure it's a good time? Hollande will offer you something eventually. With the scandals he's trying to pin on me? I won't get anything, and I don't care. I'll manage all by myself! I'm shocked that Areva is investigating your husband, - accusing you... - It's intimidation. I get harassing calls, threats... They think they're scaring me, but I'm onto them! I hired a bodyguard for my kids. You should watch out, too. They won't accept it, especially from a woman. Watch out for who, exactly? Aside from Oursel and his clique. Alexandre Djouhri, a pal of Sarko who does his dirty work. His sights are on me now, but soon it'll be you. Frankly, I can't believe... If they can take revenge, they will. Believe me. How is our issue advancing? I'm moving heaven and earth, but no one's listening. You have to aim high. Very high. The president? And this guy from EDF handing over info just now? Strange coincidence, isn't it? You said I could always count on you... You don't trust me anymore? Revelations about Alexandre Djouri They want to add few dates, but I can say no. It's OK. I've got so much work... I'll get home on Tuesday... Maureen, can you hear me? Yes! I thought I was cut off. No coverage. The line is terrible. I've gotta load the truck. Love you. I love you, too! Gilles! Hello? Mind your own business, or else... The in-house paper at EDF published it! Last month, in Avignon. Proglio and his covert team threaten journalists who talk about it. What covert team? This isn't Ukraine... Journalists have been hacked, and their data stolen... Hold on a second! Have you seen this guy before? Alexandre Djouhri? A psycho. He's a middleman in dirty deals. - A bag man? - Yeah, and that's not all. You're not telling me everything. What about Lauvergeon? You studied engineering together. Areva is recovering. Our cash flow is breaking even for the first time in eight years. I have proof you're a liar, Mr. Oursel. What did you get from the Chinese and EDF before you agreed to sign? It will be your fault if the agreement fails and people lose their jobs! At last! It was about time... Did you inform the government? Why should I answer you? You're Lauvergeon's puppet! She's a liar, and thinks she's perfect! She's got balls. As you put it. I have proof, too. I know about your secret meetings. Don't justify your failures with imagined plots. You're Proglio's flunky. Hello. This is Maureen Kearney. I'd like an appointment with President Hollande. As quickly as possible. It's urgent. Next Monday is fine. Anytime. I'll make it work. Thank you. Are you alright? You've had severe trauma to the right shoulder. The rotator cuff tendons are involved, which is causing the pain... You'll need to avoid carry anything, and get some rest... Are you sure you want to go? You don't have to ruin your health... A little shoulder boo-boo for 50,000 jobs is pretty cheap. It's more than a boo-boo. I won't stop until I get them, those bastards. You're obsessed, and it's fucking annoying! Thanks for your support. Make sure the electricity's cut. Good morning. Shit. Can I drop you at the station? I'm sorry I'm late. You're not invited. - What should I do? - Go! - I should go? - Yes. Have a seat. What are you expecting from these legal threats? Obstructionism? Seriously? You have one week to respond to our questions about the alliance between EDF and the Chinese. Is that blackmail? You think a little union lady can intimidate me? Mr. Oursel, I have 50,000 employees behind me. And government ministers. And President Hollande, too? You're a total liar! I've been sacrificing my life for months to save Areva! I won't let you get in my way. I'll reduce you to rubble. Take me to court. Go ahead, if you like! Now get out. Out! Good-bye, Mr. Oursel. I'm going to bed. I've got a big day tomorrow. - Can I take you to the surgeon? - No, it's fine. I see Hollande afterwards. It's my last shot. If it doesn't work, I don't know what to do. Maybe a hunger strike? Enjoy the game. You'll call me if there's a horse head in our bed? - You OK? - Fine. You think you're scaring me? You're wasting your time. Maureen? I'm here! Are you upstairs? Hello, Alto. Sweet doggy. Who's a good doggy? Help me. - Ow! - Sorry. What happened? Let me help you. I'll remove it. I've been working on something sensitive at Areva for a year now. I had an appointment with President Hollande. I think there's a connection. Can you tell us more? Were you being pressured? I'm used to taking a few blows. It comes with the job. Do you have any enemies outside of work? Kearney was attacked at home. What's going on? You don't think I'm involved? It's your job to calm things down. When will this union mess be over? I'm keeping French nuclear from blowing up in flight, sir. This bullshit will cause a diplomatic incident with China. Is that how we're gonna sell your plants? Fuck him. Good evening. I'm gonna walk Alto. Come! Good morning, Captain. Good morning. The attack on Ms. Kearney... Did you see or hear anything in that direction? The attack on Ms. Kearney, at No. 10, yesterday... I'm listening. Apparently I'm like her, which doesn't make life easy. But our family is really tight. I'm going to lie down. How are things with your wife? We've been together for 20 years, so there are ups and downs. But we love each other. Our relationship was strictly professional. We never had a private relationship of any kind, though of course, after I left Areva, our connection remained... cordial. Maureen's a go-getter, but I could tell she was running on empty. She should have stopped. She went too far. What kind of woman is she? She's an uncomplicated woman, meaning direct. She's a fighter, with a lot of energy. And what's surprising is there's something fragile about her, she always needs to feel supported. Maybe Ms. Kearney feels neglected by her husband, which would explain her commitment to the Areva business? You don't know Maureen. Her job is her adrenaline. I think it's an attempt at intimidation. She's upsetting someone. Did Ms. Kearney share with you the pressure she was under? Yes. Yes. She felt a lot of pressure about the EDF-China deal, about which she was shocked. Obsessed, actually... Maureen pushes hard, but she hit some resistance. No one believed her. She didn't know what to do. Ms. Kearney is an insignificant union rep excited over nothing. She was desperate for the spotlight, highlighting her political connections. I know she was under pressure. Her management was unresponsive about the Areva-China projects. Do you think the attack is related to her union activities? I have a hard time believing that. - I've been treating her for ten years. - Thank you. Have you had or do you have a psychological hold over Ms. Kearney? Is that a serious question? If my cleaner hadn't called the police, I never would have. I would have just given up. My job and everything else. Hello. Jean-Pierre Bachman. I have a meeting with Ms. Kearney. - We're aware. Go ahead. - Thank you. Just released. You haven't read it yet? No. But I can't seem to read. Not even the paper. I'm mad at myself. I should have taken the threats seriously. Don't be, it's my fault. And it's OK, I'm not dead. I'll eat it later. What's new with Oursel? Has he shown you the agreement with the Chinese? Not yet. Have you subpoenaed him? No. The works council decided not to... We're all just so stunned... Everyone's afraid, wondering who's next. Take your rum baba home. I won't eat it. Get some rest. - Try to forget all that. - Forget? You wanna see the "A" carved into my stomach? Are you crazy? What are you doing? I couldn't bear to see them. You can't just destroy a crime scene! Maybe there's evidence? Were these chairs under seal? No. - What'll the police think? - They don't give a damn. Did you see what they took as evidence? It's gonna be OK. I'm here now. As your lawyer, I'm here to help you shed light on the attack. Thank you. I'd like to show you were the victim of a destabilization campaign, - designed to shoot you down. - By who? Can you prove EDF or Areva organized a thing like that? We'll figure it out. It doesn't matter who we upset, even if it's secret agents, because the truth is on our side. I'm going to have to leave you. I have an appointment with my shrink. And I need a haircut. But we're doing this for you. And I'm doing things for myself, too. I'll leave you my card, if you need to reach me. Your dog seems nice. He is, but he's very old. You were meeting my husband? Tiresias? He isn't coming. He died two weeks ago. A heart attack. Shall we walk? I'm so sorry. Were you having an affair? No, he was just helping me. I must seem ridiculous, but I needed to know. He liked women like you. Be careful. Good-bye. I'm going into Paris. I miss the polluted air! - Can I bring you some small particles? - Great! Have a nice day. Yeah, a nice day. All good! I'm glad to see you're holding up. It depends on the day. How are you doing? At every government reshuffle, people imagine I'm in. But, no. It's all just rumors. That's because of me... What are you saying? Both of us are victims... Is the investigation going well? There's talk about some intermediary who was overzealous about his commissions... Kickbacks. Like the Taiwanese frigates. Have you heard we're a subject of society gossip? Us? Why? Apparently I'm behind the leaks about the Chinese contracts, and you're my puppet and I asked you to sacrifice yourself to save my empire. That's pure Oursel. Next they'll say we're sleeping together. Did you tell the investigators about our meetings? I don't think so... My mind's a little foggy these days. We need to know. It's important. Thinking again, I'm sure I didn't. I didn't say anything. Good. And don't. They're always looking to make trouble. Maybe we should tell the police about the bribes and intermediaries? Who should? Me? It would carry more weight. Why didn't you tell us about Paris? We know you saw Lauvergeon at the Lutetia! I thought you were protecting us, not spying on us. You've been summoned by the forensics unit. ASAP. I'll take you. See you later. If you consent, I'd like to do a new gynecological exam. I also need to see the marks on your stomach. Wait here. I'll be back soon. If you don't mind, I need to do one last test. What test? Sit down so I can insert an 8 cm speculum in your vagina. The same size as the knife. You have the right to do that? Did the captain ask you to? We'd like to verify some things. With your permission, of course. And if I refuse? What if I refuse? I've applied lubricant. Don't worry, it won't be long. Spread your legs. Relax. Is that OK? Of course it's OK. Why are you asking? All done. See? It was nothing. Is someone here? I felt a hand. Thank you. We're fine. It's your arm. It must have gone numb. I can't feel it at all. You need to move it. It fell asleep. Get the blood moving. It'll pass. It's been a long time since you massaged me. Do you want to? With the security guys everywhere? Who cares? My cleaner arrived. It was hours before she came. He didn't kill me. I was in the bathroom, putting on my makeup, doing my hair. Before I was in the kitchen, I drank a cup of tea. I drink a lot of tea. Do you have coffee? For me, here? I'll be right back. It's crazy how she recites it, so composed... If she makes no mistakes, even backwards, she's telling the truth. Or she learned it by heart, like a good liar... Let her stew another ten minutes then bring her to my office. If it was a man with a knife up his ass, would he believe him? Did you see the forensics report? The knife would have been expelled from her vagina. Has the doctor heard of tampons? When he covered your eyes, you didn't fight back? I was too afraid. I was petrified. Did you scream? I think so, but no one would hear. Did you see anything in the mirror? Nothing. Your dog was in the house. Did he bark? He didn't move. He's old. When he carved the "A" on your stomach, you didn't struggle? It was strange, I saw myself from outside... It didn't hurt. After your aggressor left, did you try to get free? I couldn't I thought he'd disemboweled me. I felt... my intestines, on my knees. The warmth of my intestines. You read a lot of crime fiction, don't you? What do you like about it? Why did you underline all these passages? The doctors say she doesn't act like a rape victim. You think she made it all up? We have no leads, even for the threats she says she got. We have to wonder... No aggressor, no aggression? So it was a setup? With self-mutilation? That's would be huge. We searched her shrink's office. Here's a copy of her medical file. You'll see, she's psychologically fragile. Maybe she just lost it? There's a lot of political pressure on this case. In high places they think her life is at risk. Neither you nor I can be wrong. I was elected by the federation to implement a real redundancy plan. You're in the paper! Nothing too bad, I hope? France-China: State Secret Kearney, a signed attack? Unbelievable! They say I'm a crazy former drunk. You could have kept this rag to yourself! She's a mess, Dad. It's heavy, and it stirs stuff up. We have cops in the yard, and journalists who write shit about us. Men in uniforms are sexy! Maybe I'll sleep here tonight. Will you have me? I can find a replacement. The concerts will do you good. And what could happen here now? Go before I change my mind. Thanks. Let's go, guys. Just one more, please. Stay a little longer. OK. But it's really the last one. A glass of Calvados? - Thanks for coming. - Of course, old friend. It's been a while. How have you been? Not well. This has gone on too long. It's no good for me. The union lady? Do you have any leads? The officer in charge is starting to doubt her story. Really? Did you know she attempted suicide a few years ago? I've been telling you: she's crazy! She wants to blow everything up, like a kamikaze! Montebourg seems to think she has real power to influence. Power to annoy! She's making me look incompetent. Put yourself in my shoes! I'm sick of being the scapegoat when all I do is fix other people's messes. I hope you can clear this up ASAP. Ms. Kearney? Captain Brémont here. Can you come to the station with your husband tomorrow? Mr. Hugo, come with me, please. - Are you OK, Maureen? - Yes, fine! You'll need to be strong, and keep calm. Good morning. Come in. Detective Captain Nicolas Brémont As of now, you're being held for questioning. You're under suspicion for filing a false report. But that's absurd! The analyses at your home are clear. No fingerprints were found that are not from you or your family. - He wore gloves! - Even gloves leave traces, particles. We found no DNA either. That's impossible. You're right, it's not. Aggressions without aggressors don't exist. As a result, the rape investigation is closed. Crazy as it may seem, you're no longer a victim, but a suspect. No evidence and no witnesses substantiate your story. I was threatened, and raped! And the scar? Who did that? Let me go! Don't touch me! Please. Do you recognize this scotch tape? It's not scotch tape, it's gaffer tape. It's like what I use for work. I've got some in the shed. This comes from your wife's handcuffs. - It's like yours... - Stop calling it mine. Other people use it, too. The tape, the hat, the knife. Everything used in the attack is from your house. Pros coming empty-handed is bizarre, isn't it? Your neighbors saw nothing. No traces of a stranger in your house. The guy's not gonna leave DNA everywhere. You see, Mr. Hugo, we don't believe your wife's story. The Chinese contract business... maybe it got out of hand? Now you need to help us get her to confess. You're sick! One's enough. You agree to continue with the questioning? - Can I go to the restroom first? - Of course. We'll take you. Your wife is a former alcoholic? She sees a psychiatrist? So? We wonder if your wife set it all up before the cleaner came. The tape handcuffs. A ten year old could have gotten free. Fine. I've had enough. Calm down, Mr. Hugo. Calm down? When you think she's twisted enough to mutilate herself? You're completely nuts! - Have a seat. - I'll sit down if I want! Have I been accused? Am I being accused of something? I was telling your lawyer that it would be good if we could go to your home, to recreate the conditions of the day of your attack. Would you agree? I was putting on my makeup. Then someone pulled a hat over my head. Facing the mirror, you didn't see the attacker? No. OK, continue... I felt a gun in my back. He made me sit on that stool, and put tape over my mouth. He made me stand up and forced me to walk to the laundry room. Show us. Pardon me. You said your dog didn't react? He's deaf and half-blind. Sometimes he reacts, sometimes not. Whatever works best... He made me sit down on a chair. Where is it? The memory was too painful, so we... We burned it. OK. I'll go get another one. Once you're seated? He started tying me up. My feet first, then my hands. He got annoyed, I couldn't see anything. He said it was my last warning. I thought he was going to stab me. Then he started cutting lines... on my stomach. He already had the knife. No, he found it here. It's ours. Where do you keep it? The drawer on the right. Lift it a little, it sticks. I see. Who would benefit from keeping you quiet? Some intermediaries, maybe? - In that kind of contract... - Do you have proof? You're completely alone. Everyone's abandoned you. Starting with your husband. Do you want to hear it from him? The "A" carved on your stomach... was that to implicate Areva? And burning your chairs was to destroy evidence? What crime novel did you find that in? Most of all, why not try to expel the knife that was in your vagina? I tried, I think... It would be better to tell me the truth. You're really not helping me... I don't like people like you. Hasn't this gone on long enough? If you don't confess, a media and political bulldozer will crush you. You'll never recover. Your family won't, either. So tell the truth. It'll be easier if you talk now. Talk! I don't want it to happen again. With what you've been through, it's normal to lose your grip. I invented everything. I made it all up. I must have snapped. Can I have a cigarette, please? Thank you. - You're leaving? - Yes. Thank you for being so welcoming. Maybe I shouldn't, but the guys and I wanted to tell you... Be careful. Be on your guard. Mr. and Mrs. Oursel, your table is ready. Thank you. See you soon, Mr. Cazeneuve. Good-bye. Excuse me, I'll be right back. Mr. Montebourg! Did you hear the news? I told you! The union lady is crazy. She invented the whole thing. It was a setup. I heard it on the radio. But let's be patient. You still have doubts? That woman is completely crazy! If you'd done your job, it wouldn't have happened. My head is spinning! Breathe, Luc. Breathe. - It hurts. - Let me give you your medicine. What kind of work do you do to be here at this hour? I write books. What kind? Crime fiction. I love crime fiction. What are you working on? I'm writing about a woman who stages her own rape. That's dark. Really dark. How does it end? Hi, Maureen, it's Jean-Pierre. Whatever happened, for us, you'll always be the victim. Lots of love. What's he doing? Captain, I've got something. June 22, 2006, three masked men attacked a woman. Her husband worked at Veolia, the water company. They raped her and scarified her skin. There are crazies everywhere! The MO is like for Maureen Kearney. No evidence, no witnesses, no DNA. Shouldn't we look into it? Is this article all you've got? The police don't have the file. Neither does the prosecutor. It was all destroyed. - Don't act paranoid, that's procedure. - Yeah, but... Chambard, wake up! We'll have her written confession soon. The Kearney case is closed. Stop wasting your time. That's an order. You can go now. Is it bad? What's bad is what happened yesterday with the police. It was unbelievable. You want me to take back what I said? None of it holds up. It makes no sense. If we start over, it'll take years, and destroy us. I'm writing a confession and turning the page. Will you also explain how you tied yourself up? Can you show me? You want some tape? You're trying to protect us, but I know you'll regret it. I don't understand. It's not about burnout anymore? Burnout isn't like that. This was more like, let's say... like going off the deep end, or Munchausen syndrome. When you invent imaginary symptoms, to attract attention. Since no one was listening to me, and I was under pressure, up against a wall, my only solution was to be a victim. A rape or an attack can't be denied. So I force people to listen, and I'm in the center of a major affair. That works. What? Are you sure about this? "inserted a knife into my vagina..." You're right. It's not possible. I can't do it. I'd never get over it. Ms. Kearney! One judge is unavailable. The hearing is postponed. And the reopened investigation? For rape and acts of barbarism? I filed a motion, but there's no news yet... What's more important than my hearing? - Calm down. - Enough! No more calm down! They had time to force a confession, but not to reopen my case? - Don't touch me, it hurts. - We're leaving. Don't worry, everything will be fine. We'll make your shoulder right as rain. Trials for false declarations are rare. The charges against you are weak. We should get them dismissed. But we have to talk about something I found in your file... What? Your first rape. What's difficult is that, at the time, the lawyers for the accused were able to cast doubt on your testimony. Yes, because, at the time, when the guy who picked me up hitchhiking raped me, I didn't fight him off. But there's another problem about that attack... I wasn't wearing underwear under my pantyhose? - Yes. - I was twenty years old. Still, the rapist benefitted from "mitigating circumstances". He only got three years, two suspended. The court didn't believe you. I wasn't a "good victim", already? Is that it? This court cannot change... I don't want to go to jail. It'll be fine. They say she's severe, but fair. Case number three. State v. Maureen Kearney False declaration to a judicial authority resulting in unnecessary investigations. No drinking from a bottle in court. This is not a picnic. Come to the bar and state your identity. My name is Maureen Kearney. You claim you were raped and subjected to acts of barbarism at your home on December 17, 2012. The investigation by the Versailles police revealed inconsistencies in your testimony, and you admitted imagining the events before retracting that statement. I remind you that you risk a maximum sentence of six months in prison and a fine of 7,500 euros. How do you respond to the accusation of false declaration? I'm innocent. I really was attacked on December 17, 2012. At what time? Between 6:30 and 7:00 a.m., I think. It's what I said in my deposition. I didn't ask what you memorized with your lawyer. I asked what you remember. There's a lot I don't remember anymore. When you think you're about to die, your brain doesn't react normally. You're accustomed to power plays. Union activism isn't la-la land. What's clear is that it upset you. You took your dealings with Mr. Oursel personally. No, I didn't take them personally. Luc Oursel was irascible. He was known for it. I regret he passed away so young. I would have liked to hear his version. That affair made him ill, as if devoured from inside. Let's return to the facts. What did you hold against him? Mr. Oursel stressed everyone out. He could be very violent. He threw a chair at me. You'd been harassing him for weeks. He snapped. You expected it, didn't you? You were obsessed by the contract with China. Your daughter said you had suicidal tendencies... You started on anti-depressants just before the events you reported. Don't you have strange dreams when you take those drugs? No, I... I wasn't dreaming. How do you explain an attacker coming empty handed? I can't. I've never attacked anyone. You said your attacker attached your feet before your hands. It's not logical. Nor is attaching your hands with twisted tape. But it makes sense if you did it yourself, doesn't it? Lowering your stockings seems impractical for an attacker. Tearing them would make more sense. You weren't wearing panties under your stockings? Another inconsistency is your claim that six hours passed between the attack and your cleaner's arrival. Six hours during which you had no physiological reaction to expel the knife from your vagina. How do you explain that? Ms. Kearney? Can you answer the question? Maureen. Duchesne here. I just heard from the clerk. You've been found guilty, with a five-month suspended sentence and a 5,000 euro fine. You got off easy. To begin. Your turn, Mr. General Secretary of the Federation of Nuclear Unions! Can we still joke around now that you're part of the elite? You're saying that? Go on, play. Be careful. You may think you can change the world, but you pay. I'm going to appeal. Are you sure? Have you talked to your lawyer? Not yet. First I'll look at my case again, find some new leads. Or look for some, anyway. Try to understand. And then I'll look for a new lawyer. Trump! I win! ...organic, and made using the finest artisanal techniques... Thank you, Mr. Montebourg. After now, to the news... Mr. Montebourg! I'm Gilles, Maureen Kearney's husband. Ah, Maureen. It was unfair what happened. How is she doing? She's getting better. Good. That business was such a scandal... I know she wants to appeal, and I understand. Tell her she can count on me. I sincerely hope she'll be cleared and we find out who did those horrors. All the best. Gilles, wake up! The fire alarm! Call the fire department! What the fuck are you doing? Come on! Let me go! It's strange. I can't tell where the fire started. But it's out now and there's no danger. You can go back inside. - Have a good day. - Thank you 120/70. You'll be OK. You risked your life for that. I didn't lie. My police record says I'm crazy, and a liar... I didn't lie! We don't care what they think! We do care! It's my last chance. I have to find the proof that I didn't lie. So... What about next time? If the whole house becomes a barbecue, what do we do then? Do you need any help? It doesn't look easy all alone. And before you attach your hands, you need to put on the hat... Not to mention the rest... No one tried! No one ever asked me how I did it, in reality. Crazy, no? Draw the curtains. If anyone sees you, it won't help your case. - Hello, Ms. Kearney. - Hello. Thank you for coming to meet me. I hesitated. I was not excited about seeing you again, Ms. Chambard. I understand. Can we sit down? I was an auxiliary officer back then, and I didn't like how your attack was investigated. You mean the one I made up out of thin air? During the investigation, I found something. My higher-ups weren't convinced, but... Former Veolia CEO: "I received death threats." Preliminary Inquiry Victim Testimony There were three of them, in ski masks... I wish I could have done it sooner. - Can I keep it? - Of course. My husband was an engineer at Veolia, in water treatment. He was working on a new deal worth several billion euros in the Gulf states. He was introduced to the man at a lunch with an investor... "The man without whom Henri Proglio would be a nobody" - Alexandre Djouhri. A few days later, at another lunch, things got heated. Djouhri wanted his 20% commission. The investor refused, and my husband supported him. He was fired from Veolia on some phony pretext. Djouhri and the investor were page one news when they got into a fight at the George V. My husband told investigators about bribes Veolia paid in the Middle East, and our lives became a living hell. We started receiving threats. We went to the police, and then it became a horror film. "Shut your face" and "You're a dead man" on the car, the mailbox... One afternoon I was alone, working from home. The children had just left for school. It was hot, and the back door was open. There were three of them, all dressed in black, with ski masks on. When they came in, I couldn't do anything. It was impossible to defend myself. They dragged me to the kitchen, tied my hands, and laid me on the kitchen table. They used a box cutter to carve a cross on my stomach, and a coffin above my left breast. Then all three of them raped me, taking turns. It felt like it lasted for hours, and I lost consciousness. When we went to the police, the detectives said they must be pros. There were no fingerprints, no DNA... They had no leads, and my story wasn't very coherent. They wondered if I'd imagined the whole thing. This investigation deserves an F. I've never seen the likes of it. It's full of errors and lies, and contains no evidence. It proves only one thing: the opinion of the officer who wrote it. I am honored that Ms. Kearney chose me to defend her. Mr. Temime has shown that I could not have tied my own hands behind my back. I suffered from a torn rotator cuff at the time of the attack. My surgeon will testify. Other new evidence will allow us to finally reveal the truth. Can you tell us more? The wife of a Veolia employee had filed a complaint for an attack similar to the one on my client. Hardly anyone knew about it. The media barely reported it at all. What is your theory of the case? It's possible the same perpetrators attacked both women, six years apart. The choice of the victims: two women with complex pasts, somewhat fragile, having previously been sexually assaulted. Depraved attempts to break women seen as weak links by men who left nothing to chance. Do you have proof? Come in. - Ms. Kearney. - Good day, Mr. Brémont. I wanted to inform you myself: you'll be receiving a summons. I'm appealing my conviction. So here you have my phone records from 2012. I highlighted for you the two anonymous calls that don't exist according to your investigation. You can keep it. Just one first bit of proof so you'll stop setting victims up as perpetrators. See you in court, Mr. Brémont? Good-bye. We're with you. Break a leg! Fortunately for my client, her mind allowed her to escape her body. Not to scream in pain when her attacker forcefully inserted something into her vagina. The knife? She didn't feel it. She felt nothing, in fact. She didn't know where she was or what was happening. She was no longer there. She was criticized for not defending herself, for not trying to break free from her ties, for having been paralyzed. It was also conveniently forgotten that moving her shoulder at all sent an electric jolt through her body. Her small body that was injured, tortured, gagged by surprise, and masked, didn't fight back against an attacker who may well have been armed? Ms. Kearney wasn't a good victim. A real victim, according to the gentlemen investigating, doesn't behave like she did. Forgotten as well: all of her fingerprints came from Ms. Kearney's left hand, though she is right-handed. At the time of the events, she could not use her right hand, and even less tie her own hands behind her back with tape. None of the DNA analyses of crime scene objects were preserved. None! The sealed evidence sent to the forensics lab never came back. All of the samples disappeared, as if by magic! Maureen Kearney was immediately suspected of being a liar. Why? Oh, right! There was that first sexual assault... Because she was raped when she was 20 years old, Ms. Kearney was somehow inclined to invent another rape? Ms. Kearney is guilty today because she was a victim yesterday? Isn't that what you were suggesting, Madam Prosecutor? First example: National Assembly commission of inquiry into the French nuclear sector Ladies and Gentlemen, silence please. The session is open. Ms. Kearney, please now swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Raise your right hand and say: "I swear." I swear. Thank you, Madam. I give you the floor. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Honorable Rapporteurs and Deputies, after the dismantling of Areva, and the disaster that followed, as I feared, and proclaimed for many months, thousands of jobs were destroyed. You can look for the thousands of nameless, faceless, voiceless victims in the press and elsewhere, but there is nothing left. Not a trace, except of me. I'm the only one who still has a name, a face, and a voice. For a long time, I was the "Areva union lady". Or that's what I was called. My name is Maureen Kearney. I didn't lie, and I didn't make anything up.
