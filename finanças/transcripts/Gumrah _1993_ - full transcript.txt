STRAY What did my baby do in school today? Papa, I danced today. Really? I never knew my baby could dance! - We also sang songs! - Very good. I'll take my baby for some ice cream! Roshni, you are here? I was looking for you over there. Let's go home, it's getting late. Grandmother! Come over here, Roshni. Where is my papa, grandmother? Tell me, grandmother, where is my papa? Ask your mother. Roshni, why do you ask this question? I've told you not to. I've often told you that your Papa... is dead. - Maid, take her away. - Yes. Let's go baby. Mother. For how long will we keep hiding this from Roshni? I think we should tell her everything. Don't you dare tell her! Got it? Mother, you put a garland on grandma's picture every day. But why isn't there a picture of my father in this house? So that even I can garland it. Roshni, I've often told you not to ask questions about your father! I am not a child mom. I have a right to know about my father! I also have the right to know, whether I'm a legitimate or an illegitimate child. Roshni don't you dare. Don't you dare call yourself an illegitimate child. Then why don't you tell me about him? - Was he a bad person? - He was not a bad person. Then what is it, mom? I am tired! I am tired of you. I am tired of your questions. You keep asking me the same question. You've made my life miserable! Do you want to kill me? If you asked this question again, - I'll never talk to you again. - Sorry, mom. - I'm sorry, mom. - I'll never ask again. Sorry, mom. I will never ask you again. Anything special? Yes. My mother lied years ago. I've reached my grave trying to keep up with it. I have cancer. I have very little time. My end is near. That's why I'm requesting you to take Roshni to Mumbai with you. So she learns to live without me. Roshni, what's the matter? What's the matter, child? Since childhood, I feel things are kept hidden from me. Kept from you? You are getting it wrong child. - Nothing is being kept from you. - What were you and Mom discussing? Nothing. I was just asking her that how long will you keep a pretty, talented girl locked down here. - Who are you talking about? - You! I know you sing very well. You call my humming, singing? What we have to see is what I call singing, and you call humming. What do people in Bombay think of it? Bombay? Yes! You're coming to Bombay with me right now. - But uncle. - You have to come. There is no way out! - Mother. - I've spoken to her. - Seeta. - Yes, sir? Quickly pack baby's stuff. It's such a lovely house. You like it? Your room is upstairs, to the left. - What's wrong? - There's somebody upstairs. - Who is it? - A boy. A boy? Not just a boy, a handsome boy. - Rahul, when did you arrive? - This morning. Roshni, meet him. He's Rahul. We've met. I mean banged into each other. If you don't mind, I'll introduce myself. My name is Rahul. Rahul Malhotra. Occupation is export-import trade. Some times in Delhi, sometimes in Bombay. London, Paris, Hong Kong, and at times in the bathroom. The only son of Ahuja uncle's friend. And most important, single. - Now your turn. - Pardon? Tell me about yourself. She's my niece. Now, she'll stay with me. Actually I want your suggestion about her. She has always been very fond of music and singing. Now you tell us, what to do? How to go about it? Uncle, Please. Do you have to do this today? Correct. Not today, we'll do it now. Just watch me! How are you? I'm calling from Bombay. I have a friend who sings beautifully. Her voice is like a golden bell. Tomorrow? At 11? I'll come over with her. Your job is done. You'll have an audition in HMV. The day after you'll record a song. The next day you'll be a star. What do you think? But you never heard me singing. - Then? - We'll hear you now. An upcoming singer will sing for you today. Excellent, Roshni! After years, I've heard such a song. I'm confident you'll become a great singer. We'll record your song very soon. Your job is done. Now may I leave to do my work? - Where? - New York. Want to come? If not New York, at least come to the airport. I want to say something. I'll never forget your act of beneficence. Just because of you, I have confidence in myself. Just wait for what lies ahead. Today I'm talking to a singer. When I'll return, I'll be meeting a star. Roshni, sky is the limit now. It's up! Your Roshni's poster has been put up! See, it's such a huge poster. Call her your sister-in-law! It's been two years, you have gone crazy about her. She hasn't even looked at you once. And you dream of marrying her! We are black marketers. We'll sell tickets, two for five. Yes, we will. But before that I'll purchase 200 tickets, Two hundred? I will earn a lot of money. Make a garland of it. And will put it around my darling's neck. And then you'll beg. Do you think 200 tickets are 200 peanuts? - Where will you get the money from? -It will come. - Where have you brought me? - It's nothing. Only two men fighting. - Nothing is going to happen. - Let's go back. - We'll be in unnecessary trouble. -Let's go. OK, OK. Where are you going now? Be quiet. Jaggu, where have you brought me? This seems a dangerous place. Let's run away. Pakya, 500 bucks can be turned into 5000 here. You'll get your bones crushed in return. Let's go. Let him go home. Excellent moves, my braveheart, excellent. Let's go, come. Keep quiet. Let's ask him the current rate. No. Listen to me. What are you trying to do? Hey, brother, - what's the rate? - I will give 30 for one. - It's too little. - Be quiet. - Just this much? - What else do you want? Come on. I'll fight him. - Are you crazy? - Be quiet. Stop! This fair boy will fight our macho man. Anybody 30 to one? - I say the odds are one to 50. - Look at that macho man. He has already knocked down previous candidate. He'll kill you and me too. It's better to sit outside the temple and beg. Be quiet! - Brothers... - We are going. - No, no. - We are leaving. - Why aren't we leaving? - Pakya will give 50 for one. - You'll have me killed. - Collect the money. Fifty for one. - There are no rules in this fight. - What are you talking about? Anyone can hit anywhere. Got it? Listen, brother. Look, both of us want to earn money. I have such a lovely face so go easy on me. Now, you are over. I'll straight away break you. You get away. I'm requesting you. What! You have turned into a sparrow now. I have such a lovely face. - Come shake hands. - You want to shake hands? Yeah, let's shake hands. Awesome, Jeva. Awesome. I told you to go easy on me. If I lost it, it'll cause you some damage. You hit me on my face! You have ruined your face. - Collected the money? - A little left. What are you talking about? I'll collect the cash. You go and fight. What are you talking about. We'll get nothing for me! - Don't be scared. - He hits hard. Hundred for one. 100 for one. On the face! This guy only hits on the face. I told you not once but twice I won't say it for the third time. It's a lover's face. Go easy. If I lost it. - Oh it's you? - Why don't you go, hit him? That rascal even kicks on the face. Has my rate gone up? - Got a lot of money. - You don't say. He hits a lot. Let's leave. Who will pay for the bets? Your Pop? They'll cremate me. Go and fight. Go, go, go. - I have your back. - You have my back? OK I'll go. - Hey you, what will you say? - Jeva. - Jaggu! Say Jaggu. - Jaggu! This is a tavern. This is a tavern. This is a tavern. This is a tavern. For all alcoholics. For all alcoholics.. This is the ultimate abode. This is a tavern. This is a tavern. This is a tavern. This is a tavern. For all alcoholics.. This is the ultimate abode. It is bad to drink but what should an alcoholic do. Some are troubled by their poverty while some are sick of their money. So what if this is poison. It is medicine for all ailments. They jump out of joy when they pop the cork. Some lost gamble while some got beaten by sorrow. This is that place. Which is visited by everyone. This is a tavern. This is a tavern. This is a tavern. This is a tavern. HOUSE FULL Lovers come here more without any objective. This wine puts everything at rest. Whether it is lover's betrayal or a separation. Can't forget those moments they recall those times by having a wine. This fire and water is their life. They have an old relation with this place. They have an old relation with this place. This is a tavern. This is a tavern. Now I will tell you the state of alcoholics. It is fun times. The lovers are swaying. They are not aware of what's happening around. Cigarette isn't lit but the finger is burnt. Everyone is feeling tipsy. They wobble and hobble. This is a tavern. This is a tavern. For all alcoholics.. This is the ultimate abode. This is a tavern. This is a tavern. - Who is it? - Flower delivery boy. You? The Calcutta police is strange. They didn't let me come on stage. And garland for you. This garland I wanted to put around your neck so I had to disturb you here. You followed me from Bombay to Delhi and now to Calcutta! Why do you waste so much of money? I earn everything because of you. I sell tickets of your show in the black-market. Earn money and offer it to you. May I garland you? Go! Don't be crazy. Go on. Go. Look at this. Your daughter has created a storm in India. Mumbai, Delhi, Calcutta. All the photographs. Who will believe she is the same Roshni, who first came to Bombay with me a few months ago. That's a load off my chest today. Now I can die in peace. What nonsense. Your enemies should die. Oh, yes. Roshni has sent a letter for you. How are you mother? I'm always worried about you. I feel like meeting you. But there's no time in Bombay. There is one show after the other. I'm very happy. The only thing I miss is that same thing. The question about my father keeps striking my mind even today. I am sorry mom. Take care of yourself. Miss you. Love, Roshni. There are worlds beyond the stars. There are many tests of love. Congratulations, superstar. - Hi, Rahul. Where are you calling from? - I'm still in America. Believe me, your songs are super hit over here. Since people found out I know you, offers for shows are pouring in. Really. That's great. - What should I tell them? - Say what you feel is right. - I'll say you've agreed. - You're confident of yourself. I'm confident about you. Romance in the air. Spending a lot on international calls. Sharma, I never waste time or money without any reason. This is an investment. You have to invest to gain. - Madam, how was your show? - People appreciated it a lot. Can you tell us the reason for your success in a short time? The people who love me are responsible for my success. Miss Roshni, when will you get married? - I haven't... - Yes? - I haven't thought about it. - I'll tell you. She'll get married as soon as she finds a good boy. I want to talk to you in private. - Sit down. - On one condition. I'll pay the bill because this is our first date. Why do you follow me? I love you. What did you say? Love, romance. I want to marry you. Listen! I know what you'll say. How can we get married when we don't know each other? But 90% people in India marry in this manner. They get married, know each other and then fall in love. I know it's old fashioned but I still like it. If you ever follow me again, I will kill you. Listen to me. Think it over. You won't find another lover like me. Promise. I've thought it out. I won't let go so easily. I'm a lover, your lover! Where will I keep these? - What's all this? - Some admirer of yours sent these. So many? This is nothing. Go in and see. You handle this. I'm off. I AM YOUR LOVER You are in my every dream. You are in my every dream. You are in my every dream. You are in my every dream. I am a part of your beautiful thoughts I am a part of your beautiful thoughts. I am a part of your beautiful thoughts. In exchange for the color I want to fill my heart with blood. I am your lover. I am your lover. I want to love you. In those deep eyes of yours I want to drown. I am your lover. I want to love you. I AM YOUR LOVER There are many ways to come and go. There are many ways to come and go. But I left all those paths. For your sake. I just want to walk. Past your lane. I am your lover. I want to love you. Take my name and attach it with yours. Take my name and attach it with yours. Or break my heart and set me free. Or break my heart and set me free. I want to live my life pleasing you. I want to live my life pleasing you. I am your lover. I want to love you. In those deep eyes of yours I want to drown. I am your lover. - Sit down. - On one condition. I will pay the bill. So you want to marry me? It's easy to nod your head but have you ever thought, how can a black marketer like you marry a girl like me? The only difference between you and me is. You have a car and I don't. You have a bungalow, an air-conditioned bedroom. Lots of dresses etc. Absolutely right. I have my own style of living. My own life style and I'm used to it. You mean these petty things, are stopping you from marrying me? OK. Let's make a list of those things. Things without which you can't live. Car with driver. A house with a garden. Servants in uniform. Bedroom with an air conditioner. Clothes with jewels. And a husband with love. That's me. Anything else? Oh no! This is enough. It will take you seven births to earn that list you made. Let's see how much time it takes. But I challenge you. Up until I don't get these things, I won't meet you again. Forget her. You're mad! Compare yourselves. We are black marketers. She is right. Make us some snack. There's an international match today. Let's sell tickets in black. - We'll earn lots of money! - I got it. What did you find? I have an idea. Arrangements will be made to earn money for my darling. God! He's here again. The first item in your list. Mercedes with a driver. - Come on. - No, thank you. Come. Come. Look at it properly. The second item in your list. House with a swimming pool. Come. The third item, a bedroom with an air conditioner. And these dresses with jewels. Have a look. - Good day, madam. - This is item number four. Servants in uniform. So what do you think? Come with me. Where did you get all this? - I stole it. - Stole! Yes. Looks like you don't read the paper. Look at this. A bank was robbed by me. I bought all this with that cash. I have all the receipts. You robbed a bank! But why? It would take me seven births to earn those items honestly. This was the only way to fulfill it. Theft. Fool! Idiot! You can be jailed. I know that. But I did this only to tell you. I love you! I can do anything for you. I can earn this honestly but give me some time. The police is here? But it's my challenge they can't catch me. - May I escape? - You won't run away! You'll surrender to the police. If I go to jail, all my plans will fail. - I'm running. - I said, you won't run. OK, I'll go to jail on one condition. That you will come to meet me in jail every week. Caught him! I've been looking for you. I have a warrant for you. Promise me, madam. Otherwise I'll escape in a second. - Now say, will you come? - I'll come. Now it's fine. It's a matter concerning the heart. - Now, it's fine. - OK, let's go. Will you come? She's my girl. Let me romance with her. Where were you? I've been looking for you. What's the matter? Is everything fine? Lie! Why did you lie? Why do you keep hiding things? Why do you keep the truth from me? Why didn't you say you were sick? Sent me to Bombay! So that you could lie here alone. - Why did you not tell me? - Come my baby. I've told you many lies. I hid the truth all my life. Now I have very little time. You want to know about your father? So listen. His name is Prakash. Prakash Chadha. He had come here from Mauritius on business. Your father was a good lawyer in addition to being a businessman. We first met at Deccan Bridge Club. I don't know what it was that attracted us to each other. One meeting led to another. Then the third. We never even realized when we fell in love. We quietly got married in a temple. The day after the wedding, for some official work, he had to go to Delhi. I was left alone. He had promised me that he would return in four to five days. He would take me to Mauritius. But he never returned. Nor did we get any news of him. There were headlines in the newspaper. Prakash Chadha has misappropriated government funds. My mother became a wall between us. Your father tried to contact me. But my mother never told me. I was expecting you. After your birth, I tried looking for him. But I couldn't find him. Whatever the world says, but my heart tells me that he is innocent. He is innocent, my child. My child... Mr. Prakash Chadha, you are all alone today? What's wrong? After so many years, I don't know why. I'm missing my country and my people. I'll go search for my Papa. Prakash Chadha's family lived in Mauritius. We don't know if they are still there. I have their old address. Roshni, I would have accompanied you, But your mother's will and the matter of your inheritance. Also needs to be sorted out. Don't worry. I'll manage. The good news is, Rahul is in Mauritius these days. I'll call him up. He'll receive you at the airport. I apologize for troubling you. It's no trouble. When you do really trouble me, then you may apologize. How did you suddenly decide to come to Mauritius? I'll tell you in the evening. Right now just leave me at the hotel. If this is the case, I'll move earth and heaven, to find your uncle and father. I swear by this flame. What are you doing? You'll burn your hand. Let it burn. It's just a hand. - Rahul? - What's the emergency? - What is it? - Good Morning, Madam. - You have to go to Paris. - I have already told you. - I won't go anywhere. - Sir, we'll lose a huge order. So be it! If we don't get the order now we'll never get it! We'll lose a lot! Madam, you explain to him. He must go. I've also booked the ticket! My staying here too is essential. You don't see money every time! Relations too count. You may go. I'm elder to you. I won't let you suffer losses... - Because of me you... -Don't you dare talk of profit and loss! - I swear I'll burn my hand... - No! What else will you promise by burning your hand? That I never lose your hand and your companionship. Great acting, I enjoyed it. That's OK but I'm fed up. Are we going to work or not? The time is ripe. Just watch. We'll do business as well as make money. And enjoy ourselves too! What did you say? What's the name of that singer? - Call her sister-in-law! - Sister-in-law! She will come to meet you every week. - Where is she? Tell me! - Don't add salt to injury. Otherwise I will escape. And if I escape, you'll lose your uniform! I'm here for your sister-in-law or I'd have escaped long ago. Terrible! I'm dead! Why are you alive? Jaggu escaped! Find him. He must be around! You go there. You follow me. A tall man escaped from the police station. Have you seen him? Why don't you say anything? As long as I live. I will keep drinking like this. Companion give me more to drink. The lips are thirsty. The heart is on fire. The lips are thirsty The heart is on fire. One sip and I've passed out. Ever since I became a little notorious. Ever since I became a little notorious. By God, I became very famous. By God, I became very famous. I became very famous. I lived in palaces I lived on streets I lived in palaces I lived on streets. I saw many jails and won many games. But I lost my heart when I fell in love. This was going to happen to me. By God, I became very famous. That mesmerizing beauty. She was like a cool breeze. The day I laid my eyes on her I made a promise. From today on I am your slave I swear by God I became very famous. Like a lost person. When you want to sleep Take some rest. Nobody knows what tomorrow will bring. But tonight we are well prepared. I swear by God I became very famous. Ever since I became a little notorious. I swear by God I became very famous. - Jaggu, don't run! - Get away! How far will you run? I won't spare you! Forgive me constable. I will never run. - It's me, me. -Oh, you? Pakya you almost killed me! How long will you keep running? Someday you will be caught. So what do I do? But I have to meet your sister-in-law. What do I do! There's one idea which will save me from the police. And I'll be able to earn some money for her every day. Then do one thing. Go abroad. You get lots of money there. Will you go to Hong Kong? I know Chadha uncle. I will work something out. I'll go. So you've also come from India in search of work. What will you do? - Anything, sir. - What does that mean? I asked what work? Something straightforward or a fraud? I wanted to be straightforward. But everything went wrong and I had to escape here. Helplessly! You are absolutely right! Man runs from his dear ones only when he's helpless. Come and sit down. Shall I tell you something? Everyone has to run in life. Sometimes from himself or circumstances. It's another matter that some get tired of running. And some like me, pretend to forget life with the help of alcohol. - What's your angle? - I'm not from the tired ones. I'll earn a decent living here. Go back, finish my sentence and then marry my love. Like me, you're also a heart patient. You can work for me till you don't find another job. With hard work and honor! Roshni, I've found your uncle. I don't deny that. Maybe you are Prakash's daughter. But how does that concern me? And why have you come to me? What can I do? You can tell me where he is. I don't know! Nor do I want to know! Whatever name my ancestors had earned in this city. He ruined that name! We were destroyed! My father died of a heart attack! He couldn't take the shock. And it was all because of him! He is dead for us! - But Uncle. - I'm not your uncle! Understood? You are my uncle! Because my father is your brother. The same blood runs through my veins as yours! We share a blood relation. You are lying! You know where my father is. Whether he's alive?! Place your hand on my head once and say you know nothing. Then I'll never ask you anything! Come with me. Five years ago when our mother was sick. He left this number. I don't know if he's still there. - What number is this? - Of Hong Kong. Hello. I'm calling from Mauritius. May I talk to Prakash Chadha? - Who is calling? - Please give him the phone. - Tell him it's from Mauritius. - Just hang on. - Father? - Father? Father, I'm your daughter. Mother told me about you before she died. So far I never knew you were alive. Listen, I don't know what your mother told you. But I know I have nothing to do with this. Father, don't disconnect! I beg you, Father. Please, listen to me. My mother was Sharda Devi. She lived in Poona. - In Poona? - Do you recall? Some crazy girl says, "I'm her father." I have no daughter. Think with a cool mind. Maybe he's not your father. Maybe but it's also possible that he is my father. That's why, he denied it. I want to go to Hong Kong. Can you help me? Sure. I too have work there. I'll come with you. You finish packing. I'll arrange for the tickets. Here's the packet. Are you ready? We are leaving by tonight's flight. - Where are you? - I'm in the bathroom. - Did you pack your bags? - It's near the table. Talked to Ahuja uncle? Yeah, I told him everything. Also you're going with me. He was very happy. Who won't be happy going with a star? It will give me a chance to meet your father, and we will have another show too. I am ready. I too am ready. Will you always support me like this? We must reach the airport. Don't you have to go to Hong Kong? Roshni, see I have no luggage. You get a trolley and bring your luggage. I have some calls to make. I'll explain in your language. Is this bag yours? Yes it is. - Do you know what's in it? - Yes, I know. Did you leave the bag with a stranger? Or was it open anywhere? No. Sign your statement. What's the combination number of this bag? Is this yours? - Are these keys yours? - Yes, they are. Look here! Is this yours? - Is this also yours? - Yes. - Is this also yours? Answer me. - Yes. And this? Whose is this? Answer us, whose is this? - Answer me. - No, it's not mine! When all these things are yours, why isn't the cocaine? Answer me! Why isn't this yours? Do you know the penalty for drug smuggling in Hong Kong is death? A death penalty! Madam, what have you decided? Do you admit you brought drugs here for personal use and were caught? - Please call Rahul... - You are lying. No man named Rahul came with you from Mauritius. We've checked the complete airline passenger list. The man sitting next to you was Anand Saxena! He's a South African dealing in diamonds. Why don't you understand? Admit to your crime if you want to save your skin. Or I will prove that you are a drug smuggler! For which the punishment is death! When I have not committed the crime, why must I admit it? So this is your decision? Very well. Very well. There will be a case and we'll meet in the court. And I will prove you smuggled drugs in our country! - I'm innocent. -And you'll be sentenced to death! - I am innocent! - Death Sentence! I am innocent! Look, crying won't help. At first all this will appear filthy. Then you'll get used to it. Then you'll like it. This stench, will smell nice later. That's better. You're very brave. When I first came here, I thought I would die. I cried for weeks. What's your name? My name is Angela. I'm from Calcutta. I've been here for two months. I won't stay for long. Why? Will you be released? They will shoot me. I was caught smuggling drugs. They proved my crime. Now, I await death. Somebody is here to see you. Me? Father... What are you doing here? I ran away from Bombay. I told you the police can't harm me. But how did you get caught? Forget it. It's the job of the police to catch us but we must escape. But hear one thing. As long as I'm alive I won't let you be harmed. These Chinese can't harm you. I'll take you away from here. If you can do anything for me, get me a lawyer. I'll get ten. Anything else? There's a Prakash Chadha here. I'd spoken to him over the telephone. He's probably my father. I had his phone number. Now I don't know where... I came here looking for him. Can you locate him and tell him his daughter is in jail? Yes, I'll bring him. Before I leave, I bought this for you. We have an old connection. Keep it. Money is great. It speaks every language. Please, keep it. I will go now. - Jaggu, where are you coming from? - I've brought a case for you. - Tell me do you want to take it? - What's the case? An Indian girl has been caught in the drug smuggling case. - We have to release her. - Who is going to pay the money? - Does she have any close relatives here? - Yes, heard her father is here. What is her father's name? Her father's name is Prakash Chadha. Yes, Roshni is your daughter. I just met her. She's in Hong Kong jail. She needs her father. In jail? For what? Go and ask her. Maybe she's innocent like you. Maybe she's been framed. Would you like her to live like you in shame? Nobody else can save her in Hong Kong. Yes, these are the papers. Go inside. - Yes? - My name... ...is Anil Bhatnagar. I'm a lawyer in Hong Kong. Jaggu sent me. I've studied your case. - So what have you decided? - I met Inspector Philip who... You can call me anything. He is of the opinion that if you admit to your crime, you'll be imprisoned for a few years. And we can appeal for mercy and get the sentence reduced. And if I don't plead guilty? If the Inspector proves in the court, that you smuggle cocaine, you can even be sentenced to death. How can I plead guilty when I am innocent? Look, my dear. The issue is not whether you are guilty or not. They found cocaine in your bag. They have a strong case. Sir, Rahul kept the cocaine in my bag! I am innocent whether you believe it or not! I know that you are innocent but... Look, Roshni, by your admitting it, they save their face and you your life. I only know this. As your lawyer, I advise you to admit it. Tell me one thing, Sir, can the truth be bargained? Go and tell that inspector that I am innocent. I have done no wrong. If he wishes he may free me. - Or he may kill me. - Just a minute. That boy, what's his name? - Rahul. - Yes, do you have his picture? There's a camera in my bag. It is in that. All right. I'll prepare your case papers. Even after knowing that my case is weak, will you help me? I have to support the truth. I'd asked Jaggu to find my father. Did he find anything? Your father? I don't know. I will ask him. What happened? Is she admitting to her crime? - No. - Why didn't you tell her? If she doesn't, Inspector Philip will prove her guilty. She can be given the death penalty! Why is she doing this? Why? Because she's my daughter! My blood! Today she faces the same accusation that I did years ago. Even I never admitted to being guilty! I got ruined! Got separated from my family! She's my blood! She's very stubborn. She won't admit it! If you're so proud of your blood tell her you're her father. I'm scared, that I might lose the case. What will I tell her? That her dad is so weak he couldn't save her? She can bear the greatest shock. Till the day she doesn't find her father. But the day she finds him, she'll break. That is why I am saying. A lawyer can lose this case, not a father. Did you find anything about that boy? There's a camera in her bag. It may contain his picture. Where's her luggage? With Philip. We'll pay him to get the luggage released. This is the rascal who has trapped my baby. Have courage. You take the elevator. I'll take the stairs. - How are you, Mr. Chadha? - Fine. You? What happened of that girl's case? That case is still in progress. Find him yourself if you have his picture. - It's the job of the police. - We know our job well. Who are you to teach us? The police will do what it has to. You do what you want to. - Clearly tell us what you want. - Everybody's God is the same. - What? - He won't listen like this. - How much do you want? - Very good. - US $50,000. - US $50,000? - Are you mad? - Me and mad? - He has gone mad! - OK. - Jaggu, you come with me. - The man is crazy! I've brought you some things. Jam. Cheese. There's an Indian who makes good sweets. And some money. You haven't answered my question. Is there any hope? We'll have to find some way. Don't lose hope. If you lose hope... Jaggu will definitely do something to get you out of here. You keep this bag. We will arrange for more money, keep this. So many things? Who gave it? Come here. - Who gave it? - What does it matter? - May I eat? - Yes. Neil. He too must be hungry. - Do you have money? - Yes. Keep it in. We'll go out tonight. We'll give this to him. Will you come with me? - Who is this? - My brother. He too is here. In the men's jail. Now I'll show you how this lock opens. This is the men's hospital. Neil, I've brought you food. This is Roshni. Can't he speak? He is dumb. They caught him along with me. The poor thing was innocent. Eat all this. Tiger! Tiger! This is Hong Kong not Bombay. You could lose your life. Life is momentary. But we need money. - Don't bet till I tell you to. - OK. Take care. - Are you all right? - Don't bet till I tell you to. - He will kill you. - Nothing will happen to me. Stake all the money. I can't. We'll organize money from elsewhere. - You'll die! - No! It's my life! - Do as I say. - Why are you doing this? Why are you endangering your life for my daughter? I'm not doing it for your daughter. - I'm doing it for myself, my love. -Your love? I love Roshni. I came here for her. My love cannot lose. Then go on. Pound the rascal to pieces! I am with you. Your love is with you. Go Jaggu! Thrash the scoundrel! Here's the money. She'll be released tomorrow. It has been proved that the packet contained talcum powder and not cocaine. Hence the court frees Roshni on bail till the next hearing. And she is warned to be present in the police station every week. - How did you manage it? - Jaggu did this, not me. I told you I'd do anything for you. I'll arrange for your air tickets. Meet me at the airport by evening. Show her the city till then. Come on. Greetings to your love, my lover. Greetings to your love, my lover. My life is dedicated to your name. I am yours. Greetings to your love, my lover. Come near. There is no distance left between us. Come near. There is no distance left between us. There is nothing left of you nor of me. Let's get lost in one another. Greetings to your love, my lover. I am yours I've become sleepless and restless. Love has made me blind I've become sleepless and restless. Love has made me blind. My steps have begun to wobble. Greetings to your love, my lover. My life is all yours, my lover. I am yours. The evidence that the customs officer placed before court, proves that Miss Roshni bribed a customs officer. And had the cocaine replaced with talcum powder. The court holds her guilty of drug smuggling in our country, offering bribery and misguiding the court. And sentences her to death by a firing squad. We will appeal. Your case will go to the Supreme Court. And if it is not accepted? Promise that whatever happens to me... You will have Rahul punished! So that he does not ever play with another innocent girl. But nothing will happen to you. My heart says so. And what does the mind say? Do you want anything else? Any news of my father? I feel he still doesn't know. What is happening to me. Nobody in this whole city knows what's happening to you. As far as your father is concerned, forget him. Forget him. Because the man who left your mother in difficulty. The one who is still running from you. Who is afraid of the responsibility of a father, it's best to forget him. Nothing will happen to you. Nothing will happen to her! Nothing will happen to her as long as I am alive. What will you do? And what will I do? They will shoot her before me and I, her father will do nothing! Being a lawyer I won't be able to save her! If I can't save her, I can help her break jail! - What did you say? - If I can't help her, I can help her break jail. Don't talk like a madman! How will she break jail? That I don't know but I know I can get her out! But how? There's no jail in the world that you can't break out of. There must be some way to break out of this one too. Jaggu, come here. Read this. When Japan attacked Hong Kong in the second world war... Seven prisoners escaped from the cell Roshni is in. It is mentioned here. It's connected to a tunnel. Meaning if that tunnel exists, Roshni too can come out. But how will you reach there? You guys don't know my idea. Let me get in. I'll set fire to your prison. Shut up! Look at this. Just a minute. One minute. Bombay jails are better. What are you looking at? I'll give you a slap! Look at him. Who asked you to spend all the money in one day? You small timers have this problem. You know how to eat but not to digest. Now rot in prison. Idiot! Got me also in trouble. I'll give you a tight slap! I'll hit you so much you'll turn dark! Shut up! Jaggu has come to this jail. He's made a map of the tunnel. He'll bring it to you. I'll wait for you at the airport tonight. I've to take your picture in these glasses. Wear the glasses quickly. I'll make your fake passport. And I'll wait for you at the airport. Hey, rotten face! Give me a smile. Is your mother dead? Is your father dead? Why don't you smile? Come here. I will show you something. I'll give you a guard's job if you come to Bombay. Look here. Here. Hail Lord Ganesh! Don't get up. Bye. Jaggu! Trust your love. Trust your love. Just wait. A little more for me. So what if the world, luck. And god turn against you. So what if the world, luck. And god turn against you. My love can't bow down. Except in front of my lover's feet. So what if the world, luck. And god turn against you. My love can't bow down. Except in front of my lover's feet. You can hurt me I don't care. I have loved and not committed a sin. My body is full of bruises. But I didn't whimper even once. Now give me another punishment. Just take my name. And show some courage. This world isn't powerful. We are not weaker than the world. Love is greater than this world. Jaggu is in the men's hospital. We only have tonight. I've heard they'll shoot you tomorrow. Do you know where the men's hospital is? I know. I can reach there. Then you must get out tonight under any circumstances. I'll wait for you at the airport. - Good luck. - Do you have some money? Now go. Get up! Jaggu, get up. Get up. Roshni... ...take this map and go. - No! - I can't come with you. I'm in a bad shape. - Take it. - I won't go without you. I won't leave without you, Jaggu! - Get up! - Don't insist. It's very important for me to stay here. Let's go. - You go. - No! - Go on! - No! Don't worry about me. I will make it there. I'll wait for you. Come soon. Hurry up. I'll always have the sorrow that I didn't meet my father. It's time for the flight. Let's go. Continue walking with me. She came to meet me. I'm her father. Go. Hurry up. My child! My child! Take care of yourself. Nothing will happen now. Still in the bathroom? Hurry up. The flight to Bangkok leaves in two hours. - I'll be out soon, darling. - Packed your bags? Yes, it's on the table. We're going to Singapore later. Shop all you want there. - Who is it? - Waiter, sir. Who are you? What do you want? Why are you beating me? What have I done to you? Roshni. This is for cheating me! This for the days and nights, I spent in jail! This for the tears I shed! And this is for misguiding girls like my daughter! Take him away! I've been waiting for you since my childhood. Don't ever leave me again! I'll never leave you! Found him! Found him! Thank you, God! I found my Jaggu! I'm running behind you since you escaped from jail. Now I've found you and I'm safe. Let's go. How are you sister-in-law? Madam, we share an old relation. I'll go to jail and get him medals. And beat Rahul some more. I'll be back very soon. - But Jaggu... - It's just a matter of few years. They will pass in a flash. I'll go and be out soon. Will you come to see me in jail? - Yes. - Found him! - Let's go. -I'll get my promotions this time. Greetings to your love, my lover. My life is dedicated to you name I am yours
