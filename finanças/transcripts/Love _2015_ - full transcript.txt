These people are unafraid. Yeah maybe I just want. You can't have that. I don't want you to come back to my police station, To my office, because you beat another guy Who looked at your girlfriend. No that's not gonna happen again. Yeah but for that you need to free yourself From that feeling, you need to forget about that. You know it's, forget about, You are in France here, forget about your American feeling Of possession, of ownership, of war, Of violence. Try to think differently, in the United States in the 60s You were different, people were loving each other. What's wrong about going in the club, Fucking other women, because you know You will fuck other women in your life, But you will fuck other women in your life in her back. Here you do it with her. It develops your confidence, your trust. I'm sure you will like it, there are gorgeous women, Beautiful women, it's clean, it's nice, There is music, it's even nicer than a normal club, Don't think about it like filthy club Or something like that, it's beautiful it's clean. You go every week or what? Oh we go often, not every week, often, yeah. And I live my sexuality in a good way, I feel relaxed, calm, balanced, I don't have the feeling you have, I don't beat people, And that's probably the most beautiful thing You can do with your girlfriend. Just to know that she has some other desire And you offer her that desire. Bring her, she will enjoy, Perhaps she will enjoy watching you Fucking another woman. As long as she knows you come back with her. We go often. And we're cool, look we are friends. When's the best time to go? Ah Friday, Saturday. The weekend. The weekend you have plenty of people, So plenty of choice, you can pick up the one you want, Or you can watch, I love watching. You loved it, you were in heaven, I look over and your jerking some French retard's Cock off. You were so sad there, fucking all the girls. Right in my face. All the girls, you were fucking another girl! You wanted me to fuck her! Oh so it's just something what I wanted now? No. I don't even know why you let me bring us to this fucking Place to begin with. You wanted to go there, and we said We would have to try everything together. Well I'm a fucking bonehead okay, So don't let me be so stupid next time, please. You fuck two girl at the same time, I want to fuck two guy at the same time. No. If you want you can join us.

What I'm sorry, how come your sorry? Relax babe, there's no problem. I want you. I want sex with you. I think I had a blackout. Don't worry. Don't worry. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. I wish I could erase that thing from my mind. Don't make such a big drama. Promise me That you will never tell anyone about this. There is nothing to hide. You can just say it to Julio. Secrets make you stronger. No. Secrets make you darker. You know what? If we had to break up, I would probably disappear. How many guys have you left? This is not the point. The guy I left, I wasn't in love. Let's try to protect each other. I love you. I love you too. I'm not painting and your not doing your stuff. We are taking so much drugs, fighting. Yeah and it's raining. And it's cold. And maybe we're not The great artists that we dreamed we were. Maybe this is All just shit. Maybe I should sleep in my place for a little while. Yeah, maybe that's a good idea. I feel we are losing time and... I'm not always a good influence for you And you are not even a real good Influence for me. Yeah maybe we should take a break. You know sometimes I miss your ponytail. Sometimes I miss to laugh. You were so joyful. When we met. When we first met? At the park? No I mean also later. It seems like a long time ago. And you weren't wearing these. Hi. Hey. You having a good time? Yeah, this is my favorite park. Cool. But I have to go. Yeah? Yeah. I'll walk with you. No I'm fine. No really I'll walk with you, It'll be more fun, it'll be nice. Anyway, you have to be careful, Because Paris is a really dangerous city With all the foreigners around. Where do you come from? America. You? I'm from everywhere. Oh one sec, Julio! What's up, where you going? Oh uhm, I'll be right back, I'll catch you later. From everywhere? I mean I'm, my blood is, Is mixed. Celine, I will call you, bye. They are my schoolmates. Yeah? I'm going to art school. Oh cool. And what do you do in Paris? I'm in film school. Are you in love? I have someone. Well of course you do, All the best girls have someone, But they're not all happy. But you didn't say you were in love with him. I don't know anything about love, But in my mind it's like a place You don't want to live. Okay? It would be something like a... Okay, so you've been in love, You know what it feels like, But your no longer there, you left? Well I mean, It happened that we wound up in a situation Where you feel a lot of love around you. Not only like in a relationship, I mean love is, No, love is life, Love is life. Hey, no that way! This way? Yeah. Sorry. Sorry. It makes people brag. Yeah it makes people brag, Also it drives people crazy. A young person without love is like, Like a sparrow without air. Oh you didn't know you could fly, did you? That's what I want to do. It's true, you think I'm joking? I'm serious, I'm fucking serious like now. Look we live one life. When we're born, we know we're gonna die. And so what's the point, To keep on fighting? For what? There's no hope, because, We should just commit suicide. I don't wanna say goodbye. Hey. What's the meaning of life? Love. What's your name? Murphy, what's yours? Electra. I wanna fuck you so much. So much... Will you promise me something? No matter what, We will protect each other, From anyone, That will ever stand between us. I promise. I promise too. Are you afraid of death? I'm afraid of pain. I don't wanna die in pain. I'd rather Commit suicide. Please, please, please, God, Tell me she's okay. I don't want anything bad to happen to her. Just tell me she's okay. Tell me she's happy. Tell me she's alive. No, please, God. Tell me this isn't true. No, no, no... I wanna go back. I wanna go back to the first night. I wanna wake up with her. Grant me this one wish. Please let me do that. And I swear I'll live a good life. I swear, I swear to you. A place that. I swear that this is ours. Life is what you make of it. I'll be good. Like a dream. I'll be true. I like you. I like you too. Electra I love you. There's nothing after death, Nothing, Nothing at all. Did you come inside me? When you die. You die with your memories.
