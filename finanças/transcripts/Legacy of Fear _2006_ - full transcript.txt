♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Mellow R&B - Cathy, Cathy, Cathy... [ Muted gunshot ] - What are you doing? - Hi, Cathy. [ Sobbing ] - Daddy! Daddy! [ Growling ] [ Phone ringing ] - Hello? - Partner, a housecleaner just found two stiffs on Crescent. Looks like our boy's at it again. - I'll be there in 20 minutes. [ Sighing ] [ Police radio ] - Two victims, no sign of a struggle. Male, one shot to the head. Female wasn't so lucky. He strangled her, but not before having his fun. Ritualistic cuts... Tied her up, just like he always does. You see the Polaroids? Bound, photographed, and strangled. It's the BPS Killer! - You sound a bit too excited about that, Wilson. - Uh, what my partner is trying to say is shut the hell up. - What? It's not like it's a secret. The guy's killed 8 people already. - Already? This whole damn city is in a state of BPS panic. The last thing anyone needs is a wannabe detective and his half-assed speculation. Now I suggest you go serve and protect on the front lawn. - Well, that was kind of brutal. - So's this. That's the kind of excitement he wants. - Looks like he left another note. Written in is own special code. - I'm sure it's another demand for publicity. - What do you think this guy goes home to at night? - God only knows. - Details are sketchy on what looks to be another two victims of the BPS Killer. - It's too early to tell if this is the BPS Killer. There appear to be similarities but we're not going to comment until we've got a chance to review all the evidence. - How can he keep getting away with killing people? - That detective is stupid. - Well, I hope they catch him soon. It scares me to be home alone when you're working nights. - You don't have anything to worry about. I quit my night job. - You mean it? - Absolutely. I can't have my wife and baby home alone with the dangerous BPS Killer running loose, can I? Besides, I'm going to be a hands-on dad. One more night, I'm all yours. [ Doorbell ] - Yes? - Hi. I'm conducting a brief poll for Councilman Wallis. Are you aware the state plans to approve a toxic waste dump a few miles from here? - No! I wasn't. - It's unbelievable. I haven't found one resident who is. If I could have a moment of you time it would go a long way toward fighting it. - Mommy, I can't find Red. - Well, hi there! What's your name? - Jeannie, but my dad calls me J.J. - Well, that's a very pretty name. - Thank you. - And you have a very pretty doll. Listen, I can see you're busy. - No, it's OK. I'd like to hear more about it. Come in. - I want you to be real quiet now, Jenny. OK? No matter what you hear, all right? - Please! Don't hurt her! - Well, that all depends on you, Linda. Help me make your husband understand what it is I do. [ Sobbing ] I might just let your daughter live. - I think we've been looking at this case ass-backwards. - How's that? - We've been looking for patterns in his victims. Physical type, age, occupation... Hoping to figure out his next move. Forget random. What if he knows 'em? Stakes 'em out. [ Screaming ] [ Screaming ] - Well, that would explain a lot. - If he knows the victims, knows the schedules he's got all the time he wants. [ Telephone ringing ] Joyce. - You're a lucky man, Detective. It takes special courage to die the right way. For all your bravado somehow I doubt you could die with the same dignity and courage Linda has shown. - I'm not sure I know who this is. - Yes, you do. There's no need to trace this call, Detective. I'm calling from your bedroom. [ Linda moaning ] [ Dial tone ] - Get a car to my house, now! [ Siren ] [ Siren ] Oh, God... J.J... - Jeannie! - What's wrong? - Nothing. I'm done. Let's go get coffee. - OK. You sure you're supposed to be eating that? - One of the perks of living as long as I have is that I can do whatever the hell I want. - Seems to me that your doctor recommended against it. - He also recommended that I do this aerobic walking every morning. So, it's a wash. [ Laughing ] - You're a trip! - So, how's work? - What kind of question is that? - I'm making conversation here! I'm old! Humour your grandmother. - It's good, it's fine. It's been quiet. - Good. - Mmm-hmm. - How's that new partner of yours? What's his name? - Fred. Fred Brampton. He's good. I'll tell him you were asking about him. - You like him? - Yeah, he's fine. Still a little green yet. - Do you like him? - Oh, you're a nasty old woman! - Why? Because I'd like to see you find balance in your life? - Why do I have to be married to have some balance? - Who said marriage? - Everything comes back to marriage with you. - What's wrong with marriage? - Nothing, if that's what you want. I don't. Maybe someday that'll change. But right now I have a career that fulfills me. - Your father had a career that fulfilled him too. You're just as obsessive about your work as he was. - You're saying I'm going to end up like my father? - I'm saying you're obsessive because of what he did. And I don't want to see it rob you of the best years of your life. - My job is part of my life, Mimi, and I love it. Why can't that be enough? - Is it enough? - Yes. I'm very happy with my life. Very happy. - OK, what kind of juicy tidbits do you have for me? - How about the guy at the counter? He looks juicy. - I'm serious, Jeanne. I'm a journalist with nothing of consequence to write about. You're a homicide detective. If I can't exploit my friend, it's time for a career change. - We have an opening in Vice. - Does it pay? - Vice always pays. [ Chuckling ] What do you want me to do? Make something up? Things are quiet. It's the way we like it. - I'm not talking about your love life, Jane. - You're a real stand-up. Just like my grandmother. - If you mean that we both understand the medical benefits of getting laid once a year, then yeah. - Come over for dinner on Saturday. Unless of course, you get a better offer. - I'll be there. - Hi, Cindy. - Morning. - Is Freddie in yet? - Half hour ago, with doughnuts. - You're easy. Good morning. Ow. Thank you. Huh... - Hey, boss. Just finishing up the paperwork on the Anderson shooting now. Be on your desk in 5 minutes. - You don't need to beat me into work everyday, Freddie. - I know. It just works out that way. - You better take it easy on those doughnuts. Cindy thinks you're coming on to her. - Really? Ha! Maybe I'll bring in some danishes tomorrow. See if I can't get lucky. [ Phone ringing ] - Yeah? We're on it. - Where we headed? - Boathouse Cove. Two bodies. One of them apparently very ugly. [ Siren ] - Hey, Jeanne. Fred. - Hey. - What you got, Val? - One male, one female. Killed sometime between 10:00 and midnight. The male took one shot to the back of the head, execution-style. As for the female, somebody really did a number on her. She was strangled, but they took the long way around the barn to get there. A few small cuts. Looks to be ritual. I'd say she was kept alive for a couple of hours before she was strangled. I'll know more when I get her back to the lab. - Got any prints yet? - No, not yet. But we'll go through the drill. Now look at this. - What do we got here? That's our girl, isn't it? - It appears to be. - What kind of a sicko likes killing so much, takes pictures of it? - BPS. - What was that about? What's BPS? - A serial killer. - Great. Why haven't I heard of this guy? - Disappeared 30 years ago. - What are you talking about? - I'm not sure, but if I'm right, we're looking at a monster. Bound, photographed, and strangled. The BPS Killer terrorized this city for months in 1977. It's the same M.O. Duct tape, ritual cuts, Polaroids. Looks like we've got some catch-up research to do. - Mmm-hmm. - Mmm-hmm. [ Elevator bell ] [ Knocking ] - Hey, Jeanne. - Hey. - Sorry. - No, no. You'd think a homicide detective would be used to looking at dead bodies by now, huh? - Occupational hazard for me. After a while, it's kind of like dressing a mannequin. So, are you here on business or pleasure? - It's all business until 6:00. Is this our girl from the boathouse? - Yeah. I'm not quite finished yet. But here's the report on the man. - Oh, great. - What about after 6:00? - Uh, after 6:00 I rest up for the next day. - Well, you must eat dinner. - Yeah, when I remember to. - You don't make it easy, Jeanne. - Make what easy? Oh... You're asking me out? - Is that a bad thing? - No, I'm flattered. Really. It's just I'm not interested... - Fair enough. - No, Val. I mean I'm not interested in dating anyone at all. Period. That's what I meant. But if I was... Anyway... - The guy was killed by a single head shot. .38, died instantly. I sent the bullet to ballistics. - OK. But the real story's with our girl, huh? - Yeah. Cause of death was strangulation. - Fifteen cuts, 3 burns with a lighter and he strangled her. - How did you know that? - Thirty years of prep work. Is there any chance the killer left any DNA evidence on her? - CSI didn't find anything at the crime scene, so I'd say not good. - Things have changed in 30 years. He's got a lot to think about now. He's going to make a mistake this time. - You think he's killed before? - If it's BPS, he's killed plenty. And if it's not he's about to. [ Knocking ] [ Knocking ] - It's Fred. Hey! - Hey! - You up for a little overtime? [ Chuckling ] Veggie special! [ Sighing ] What I can make out, BPS liked taunting the cops as much as he liked killing his victims. - Yeah, he would call and tell them where the bodies were. They have recordings of his voice but they could never close to catching him. - No. Jeanne, why didn't you tell me? - Habit. First thing people think is I'm obsessed with the case and can't be objective. - Are you obsessed with the case? - For as long as I can remember. But I am objective. And I am sure that the boathouse murders are somehow connected to BPS. Absolutely. - Well, for what it's worth, I think you're right. - Thank you. - But why would he just stop then start up again after 30 years? - Maybe the only thing he stopped was bragging about it. - Huh... Your father was running the investigation. You think BPS got to him? - I think that my father made it personal and he paid the ultimate price for it. That's why he shot himself. He was absolutely devastated after my mother was murdered. I had the hardest time sleeping for years afterwards too. - I don't know how you kept it all together. - Yeah, I've got it all together. My booming social life shows you how popular I am. - It's quality, not quantity that counts when listing friends. You're a good cop. I'm proud to be your partner. - You know, my father was a great cop. And I've always considered him to BPS's last victim. - It's him, Ray. - Aw come on, Jeanne. It's a big jump for 2 dead bodies with a couple of cuts and burns, don't you think? - What about the Polaroid? - A Polaroid doesn't make a serial killer. - BPS's original first two victims were killed in a boathouse similar to the one these two were found. In both killings the man was shot in the head the woman was bound, cut, and strangled. I follow the facts and connect the dots like a good cop. It's not a coincidence. It's him. - You really think this guy starts killing again after what, a 30-year vacation? - At this point it could be a copy-cat killer. I admit that I don't have all of the answers but these killings are not a coincidence. I know that. And they're not going to stop. It's either BPS or it is someone just as deadly. - OK then, we're dealing with a serial killer. - Thanks, Ray. - Jeanne? - Yeah? - Make me look like I know what I'm doing, OK? [ Screaming ] - The DNA extracted from the boathouse belongs to the victims. - Where they killed there? - The evidence says yes. - That fits with BPS. - There's something else. She was strangled with an old hemp rope, at least 20 years old. The neck wounds are definitely post-mortem. - You sure? - I'm sure. Why would someone strangle a corpse? - To send a message. - They found number 3. - In a wooded area? - In the wildlife reserve. - Well, let's shut it down before the press gets wind of it. - I just have to change. - BPS wouldn't go to the trouble of mimicking his own murders so perfectly. Nobody gets past here. - Why not? He was all about his own publicity. - It doesn't feel right. Not like this. We're dealing with a copy-cat killer. Same cuts... Strangulation... - Yeah, it's the same M.O. - It's going to be in code. Same one my father broke. - What is that? - It's one of his trophies. Connie McMullen's driver's license. - Who the hell is Connie McMullen? - His third victim. - Guess that shoots your copy-cat theory all the hell. - Maybe. - What copy-cat theory is that? - Kathleen, what are you doing here? - I got an anonymous tip from one of my adoring fans. - Let's go. - Give a girl a break! - Fred, wait. What kind of tip? - A phone call. He said the biggest story in 30 years was out here. What's going on, Jeanne? - He picked you. - What do you mean? - He wants to use you as a conduit to the public to tell them just how frightened they should be. But I don't want that story broken right now. - All right, but I think you can trust me enough to tell me why. - We've got a real psychopath with a taste for killing and an even bigger taste for publicity. If you break this story now, you start a panic. - The public has a right to know if for no other reason than to protect themselves. - OK listen, Kathleen. I want a shot at this guy before all hell breaks loose. It is personal. He's making sure I know that by picking you. - You know I will do whatever you want. But you got to give me a break here. I need this. Just keep me in the loop and I will sit on it until you say go. I promise. - You're already in the loop, Kathleen. But you should know that everyone in the loop is a target for murder. What is it about red meat grilling that brings out the animal in me? - It's primal. Somewhere in your DNA is a cavewoman who wants to be taken and fed. - That's the truth. Any chance you can get Fred over here for dessert? - Trust me. He's not your type. - Like hell he's not. Another glass of this and he can tie me up for an evening of light spanking. - Not funny, Kathleen. - You need to lighten up. What is your problem? - I don't have a problem. - Like hell you don't. - I understand your job can be a downer but you gotta learn to leave it at the office. Life's too short. - Don't lecture me about how short life is. We have a man running around tying up women and killing them. - That is not what I'm saying, and you know it. I'm just trying to have a little bit of fun. I'm just as concerned as everybody else is. - I don't think so. - What does that mean? - It just means that it hits a little bit closer to home for me. You know? - Granted you do have a front- row seat to all the carnage. But that's no reason to hammer me. - Remember what I told you about my mother's death? - You told me she died in a car accident when you were 6. - She was murdered by BPS. - What? - She was his last victim. I was tied up in the closet listening, waiting for my turn, but he never came. - Oh my God... Jeanne, I didn't know. Why didn't you tell me? It's not exactly dinner conversation, Kathleen. - I'm sorry. - It looks like your boy put his John Hancock all over the boathouse murders. Ballistics ran a perfect match between the .38 slug we pulled from this guy's head and all the slugs they found in the BPS victims from 30 years ago. The guy's using the same gun. - It all just seems to keep falling into place, doesn't it? - You don't sound convinced. - BPS left a coded message announcing who he was with the second woman he murdered, Connie McMullen. This new note uses the same code. But this time it's a threat, to me. - "The fun is just getting started. "Let's do it all again and fulfill your destiny, Jeanne." It's him, Jeanne. It's got to be him. He's got all the same trophies. He uses the same gun. He knows the code. Who else could reproduce his murders with the same level of precision? - It all fits but it just isn't the right tone. I can't explain it, but it just isn't the same arrogance. - You were a kid, Jeanne. You really think that you can remember the tone of a serial killer's taunting all these years later? [ Sighing ] - Maybe not. I know where I can find out though. [ Knocking ] What took you so long to open up the door? - I was in the shower! - Um... I... I need to talk to you. - What, your phone's broken? - It's not really something we can talk about on the phone. It's important and it's difficult. - Difficult short or difficult long? - It's BPS. - I don't talk about that. - He's back, Mimi. I know that we don't talk about this but I really need your help. - Your father always said "BPS wants to be in the serial killer's hall of fame." They had a secret battle going on between them. BPS wanted Don to be his puppet, a conduit to fame. Don would have none of it. He twisted every arm in the local press to hold the story down. Just give them the facts, nothing else. Well, a lot of people felt that by not giving BPS what he wanted Don was pushing him to kill more. And your mother was one of them. - And did Dad know how she felt? - No. Oh, she tried to tell him but he was so obsessed with the killings he lost his objectivity. - How? How was he obsessed? - He brought everything home. Pictures, evidence. Couldn't talk about anything else. Your mother put up a brave front but it was obvious to me how scared she was. - Scared of BPS? - No, scared of what it was doing to her husband. Don became obsessive with the objects that BPS took from his victims convinced that they held the answer to catching him. - Yeah, the trophies. - Your father started collecting all the same items to try to get inside the killer's head. - Collecting the same items? - Yeah, whatever BPS took, Don would take the same thing. If he took the victim's sock, Don would take the other one. If there was a watch missing, or a piece of jewelry he'd find out exactly what kind it was and buy the same thing. He was copying him. - What did he do with it? - Linda said he laid it all out on the basement floor and stared at it all night. Couldn't sleep. She could hear him down there pacing back and forth, talking to himself. - Do you hear me? Don't! - After he died, I got rid of everything. - Don't look at me like that! You hear me, dammit? Don't! - She was convinced that he was trying to think like that madman. It's not hard to understand why Don did what he did after Linda died. - Oh my God. That's it! BPS took Connie McMullen's driver's license. It's the only thing of her personal effects that was missing. That's the way Dad first fingered him as a serial killer. - I don't understand. - The new killer left it on Tara Leach's body as a calling card. Serial killers don't give up their trophies. - Are you saying it isn't BPS? - That's right. He took Tara Leach's license to mimic the original murder But BPS doesn't need to prove who he is. He's too arrogant. We are dealing with a copy-cat. Thank you so much. Thank you. - Oh my lord, I forgot! I've got a date, and I'm not ready! - A date? What does that mean? Got a date? - I mean a man's taking me out to dinner. - Get outta town! - No, just down the street. And you be nice to him when he comes. - Well... - He's younger than me! Whoa! - You're so excited, you don't know how to get into your own house! - Hello? Hello? Is anybody home? - Hi! Right here! - Hello. - Hello. - I'm Jerry DiCaprio. Is Mimi ready yet? - Actually, she's still upstairs. I'm... - Jeannie. I would know you anywhere. - Really? How would you know me? - I told him! - You're all she ever talks about. - That's not true. I talk about my sordid medical procedures. - That is true. - That's nice, Mimi. Where are the 2 of you off to tonight? - What are you? My mother? - I just thought it would be nice if I joined you. To get to know Jerry. - Forget it! Two's company, three's a nightmare. - But... - Get your own dinner date! - Hey! - Hey! - Is that rain check still good? - I didn't know we had a rain check. - Well then, I guess I'm buying. - You're so dreaming right now. There's no way you're getting anything out of me. - Come on, Freddie. - He's going to kill again tomorrow night. One male shot in the head, left in a car. One female strangled and left near a river. - Yeah, but where? - I don't know where. - What do you want me to do? Want me to pull over every car with a man and a woman and send them home? I'm not saying that I don't believe you, Jeanne. I'm just saying that there's not much we can do but wait. Right now I've got every available body on patrol. All we can do is hope to get lucky, that's all. - This isn't about being lucky, Ray. This is about out-thinking this bastard. - Then go out-think him. But it's a big county, Jeanne. Why don't you narrow down his target area to let's say something like 10 square miles? Then we can talk about a dragnet. How about that? In the meantime, why don't you go back to your dinner date over there and let me get back to my coping mechanism, OK? - Cheers. Have fun. [ Sighing ] I swear, sometimes he can be so infuriating. - Yeah, I know the feeling. - I'm not pulling this out of thin air. This guy is taunting us. Telling us how and when he's going to murder. Am I right? - Yup. - BPS is dead. That's why he stopped killing. I know that I'm right about this nutjob. He's paying some kind of twisted homage to BPS. He must know him, Val. Because he knows the smallest details about the murders. Things that only BPS would know. He's got the trophies, he's got... - Jeanne? - Yeah? - I thought we were going to have a nice dinner, and conversation... - Yeah, that's what we're doing. - Well, then can we talk about something else? - We're chasing a killer. I mean, what else is there to talk about? I can't exactly check this at the door. - Well, I can. This is a job to me, Jeanne. I do have a life outside the lab. Cops need to compartmentalize to deal with the crap we gotta deal with. If we want to keep our sanity. - Yeah. I mean, I hear what you're saying. It's just I need some closure on this to get on with my life. - I guess you should have told me that before we ordered. - I'll catch you later. That is the kind of disappointment that comes from love, not work. - You working for the rags now? - Just calling it how I see it. - You need to have your eyes checked. Because we're friends, nothing else. Under a lot of work-related stress. - Whatever you say. So, you think BPS is going to strike again tomorrow night? - And where did you hear this? - You know how boys like to talk. - Yeah, he left a letter for me, telling me that he was going to keep on killing until I fulfilled my destiny. - What destiny? - To be bound, photographed, and strangled. His last victim. Just like my mother. Have a good night, Kathleen. - OK, OK... Let's call it a day before you knock my head off. - You're not patronizing me, are you? - Hardly. Hate to be the guy who tries to steal a base on you. Here, hydrate. So... You this obsessive about everything, or just all things non-sexual? - Ha! Don't confuse obsession with passion. - Ah, that's what you call this. Seems to me you've got a passion for pummelling men. - Just one man. You know, I've spent my whole life thinking that BPS was going to come back and kill me. Can I trust you with something that's a little screwed-up? - You can trust me with anything. - I was actually kind of relieved when this guy showed up. It's like every nightmare I ever had finally made sense. I know he wants to kill me but for the first time in my life, I'm not afraid. I think the only person in the world that can understand that is him. - Guess we better find this guy, huh? - I know I'm close, I just can't crack it. Because of that, two people are going to die tonight. - You've grown into quite a woman, Jeannie. Have you thought about me as much as I've thought about you? I've been waiting a long time for this moment. You have been thinking about me. Your mother changed the way I looked at people. She was strong, and beautiful. I chose her for revenge, but she taught me how important life was. Your life. She was willing to do anything for you. Even knowing that I was going to kill her after it was done. What about you, Jeannie? Are you the woman your mother was? [ Spitting ] I'm going to make you pay for that with more pain than you can possibly imagine. B... [ Knife scraping ] P... S. Connect the dots. Come and find me. - B... P... Rose Park. Rose Park! It's a B. The first two sites are different. But the pattern is identical down to the exact distance. - What are you talking about? - The sites were the bodies were are in the shape of a B. I think I know where he's going. - I'm calling back-up. - No, if I'm right, we can't risk it. This may be my only shot. I'm on my way to Rose Park, where Tapley turns into Bay. - OK, I'm on my way. At least wait for me, Jeanne. Jeanne? [ Sighing ] - I'm Detective Joyce! Freeze! But your hands where I can see them. I said put your hands where I can see them, now! [ Woman mumbling ] [ Gasp ] - [P.A.] Orderly, to surgical supplies. - How you feeling? - Where am I? - General hospital. That's one nasty bump you got on your head. Any idea who gave it to you? - No. There was a girl. - Yeah, well, all we found was the dead man, and this. On your forehead. - "Not yet... BPS." Right. - Car belongs to Kevin Cunningham. He was the stiff next to your car. - He's going to change his pattern now that I blew it. I got to get to the station. - Whoa... You're not going anywhere. Except for home. Couple days rest. This is Ray's orders. And he also wanted me to tell you that we are searching every single riverbed in the city but so far nothing. - Am I interrupting something? - No, no, Mimi. It's fine. - Oh... - I'm OK. This is Fred Brampton. - Hmm... The partner? - Yes, the partner. And can we please submit all embarrassing questions in writing? - It's very nice to meet you. - So, Fred... What do you think about our girl? - I think that she's going to be just fine. As long as we can get her home to bed. - You have my permission. - You are a nasty old woman. - What you call nasty, I call practical. - OK, I got to get going. - Please do. Don't forget this. - Thanks. Good to meet you. - Give up. - Hi there. What's your name? - Jeannie, but my dad calls me J.J. - Well, that's a pretty name. Look, I can see you're busy. - No, it's OK. I'd like to hear more about it. Come in. [ Phone ringing ] - Hello? - All hell just broke lose. Get your ass back here now. - What's going on here? - Surprise! - Happy birthday! - You may have forgotten about your birthday but we didn't. We have big plans for you tonight. - Were you two in on this? - Guilty. Happy birthday, Jeanne. - Come on. You could use a night out. Forget about this psycho. Go tie one on with the girls. He'll still be out there tomorrow. - Come on. You need a night out more than I do. - I really appreciate the sentiment, you guys, but no thanks. - Then that's an order, Detective. - I know you enjoy calling the shots but you're not in charge of my personal life. - Ooh! Well, you're absolutely right, so why not I rephrase that? Either you go out and celebrate your birthday tonight or early tomorrow morning, in my office and we'll have a little talk. It's your choice. - Let's go. Come on. Bye! - OK... - Let's get this party started! [ Screaming and whistling ] ♪ ♪ - Mornin', partner. I understand your party was a big hit last night. - Big is relative, Fred. Unless of course, we're talking about guns. In which case, bigger is always better. And from the look of your panties here I would say that you missed out on that memo. [ Chuckling ] - Fun's over, folks. Back to work. You know, it would have been nice if somebody had told me. - OK, I had no idea. Kathleen promised me. I don't understand. - I just spoke with the Governor. He's demanding we come clean to the press with the whole story. - You can't. You'll start a panic. - What do we got going now? - We cannot give this bastard what he wants. Just let me run point on this. We will talk to the press, but we'll use as an opportunity to... To provoke him into making a mistake, OK? - I just hope you're not making a mistake. - "I gave you a chance to be part of history "and you ignored me. "I suggest you visit the library "and check with Emily Post on etiquette. Do it again and you'll pay with your life." - I'm sorry, Jeanne. It was waiting for me when I got home. We were 15 minutes to press and I thought you'd say no. - You still should have called me, Kathleen. - I know. I know, but I was scared. - It's all right. We're going to get this guy. All right, this is what we know. The first 4 murders were an almost perfect re-creation of BPS' first 4. And the woman I saw is most likely the 5th. Not just because of the way they were killed but because of their size, their age, and hair colour. It's obvious to me he spent a great deal of time researching his victims. - These weren't random choices? - No. His timing, his preparation... It's obsessively meticulous. There's no doubt in my mind that he had 11 victims chosen before he even made his first kill. - That's so he could stick to BPS' original time frame? - Exactly. He knew their schedules. He predetermined where to kill, where to dump the bodies, and all without a single trace of evidence. - So where does that leave us? - He'll definitely change his location pattern I'm sure of that. But he will stay on his original timetable. Which means that he's going to kill again tomorrow night. [ Sighing ] "I suggest you visit the library and check with Emily Post on etiquette." - You think she's being rude by blowing him off the first time he called? - This isn't a reprimand. - Great, another one of the psycho's cheeseball little games. - Well, he's nothing if not arrogant. Here it is. Emily Post, all about etiquette. - What does it say? I don't get it. Why dump her all the way the hell out here just to tell us where she is? - We had to find her before the animals do so we can appreciate his handiwork. - This is getting old. - Things are only going to get worse. If only I wasn't out wasting my time last night I could have figured it out and saved her. - Come on, Jeanne. You went out with friends. You can't live this thing 24-7. - He does. Take a look at that girl and tell me I'm doing enough. - Maybe it's time you step away from this, Jeanne. You're too close to it. It's not a knock, it's just this guy's in your head. There's no way of knowing whether he'll play you again. - Sounds like you're saying I'm a problem. - I'm saying you're a huge part of this psycho's motivation. Take you out of the picture, what does he do? - He kills, Fred. We're all part of his equation. - One of her earrings was ripped out. It's not here. - I was right there that night. I could have saved her. - Pretty doll... - Give me a glove. - What is it? - It's my doll. - What do you mean? - When I was 6, I was playing with... He's saying how he's going to kill me. Fred? Can I get a picture of this please? The murders appear to be related But I would like to reiterate that we are not dealing with BPS. I'll take questions now. - How do you explain the Polaroids left on the bodies? - He may be a copy cat, but it's not BPS. - How do you know? - Uh, copy cat finds fulfillment in merely mimicking. BPS revelled in what he considered to be his art: fear. - Wasn't your father the detective in charge of the BPS investigation? - Yes, he was. - And your mother was BPS' last victim before he disappeared? - Thirty years ago, yes. At the time, this rendering was circulated nationally. It was sketched as per the description of the only person to see BPS, me. I was 6 years old. I know every detail of every murder. And I can tell you unequivocally that we are not dealing with BPS. The person that we are looking for is a coward with little intelligence and no insight into human behaviour whatsoever. - Are you worried that he might be coming after you, Detective Joyce? - It is not BPS. No, what worries me is that the people of this city will allow a lone psychopath to affect the way they live their lives. Thank you. - Detective Jeanne Joyce, sole survivor of the BPS Killer's original reign of terror standing defiant against a serial killer determined to galvanize our city with fear. - You better know what you're doing. - I do. Every time he makes a play for attention I'm going to run interference and have the press talk about me, not him. - We just put a bull's eye on your back. - He put the bull's eye there. I just gave him a reason to use it. - Gerry says you were wrong for calling the killer stupid. - I don't give a damn what Gerry thinks. Who is he? Where did you meet him? - Bingo. - Bingo? Bingo, Mimi? What does he do? - He's a retired butcher. And that subject is closed. Now I haven't made this in years, so don't expect too much. - Come on. Nobody makes casserole like you, Mimi. It smells good. - Your mom never liked my casseroles. - Really? I find that hard to believe. - She was a bit of a snob when it came to cooking. I think it was the artist in her. She was a great cook. She could make a plate of hot dogs taste like a gourmet meal. - I don't remember. - Oh... I always forget how small you were when we lost her. Hard to hold onto your memories when you're that young. - I want you to be real quiet now, Jeannie, OK? No matter what you hear. All right? Shh... - Please! Don't hurt her! - That all depends on you, Linda. - No child should have had to endure what you did. But Jeannie, it's been 30 years. And you can't undo the unspeakable horrors he committed to your mother. - I'm not trying to undo anything. - Aren't you? - No. - Your mother wasn't the only thing that monster killed that day. Part of you is still in that closet. And that part's lost, Jeannie. Finding Linda's killer isn't going to bring that back. - I'm not trying to find Linda's killer. I'm just doing my job. You bastard. - They were a little late. - I think it's OK... - Jeanne. - Yeah, Ray. - I'd like a word. - Noun, verb, or adjective? - How about suspended? The serial killer enters your apartment leaves you a token of his affection and you don't brief me on this? - I just wanted confirmation from Val. - Like hell you did. You don't play me on this one, Jeanne. I warned you about this lone ranger crap. - I'm sorry. I wasn't hiding anything, Ray. I just didn't think that it was... - You didn't think it was important? You didn't think it was policy? What? - What do you want me to say? - Yes, sir. No, sir. And I won't do anything without back-up, sir. If this sick bastard wants you on his trophy case then I want him to go through every man I got to get to you. Is that understood? - Yes, sir. - Good. - And Ray... I love you too, sir. - It's a perfect match. I'm sure DNA tests will confirm her blood on it. I guess we know why he took it now. - He's letting me know that he can get to me whenever he wants. - If that's the case, doesn't it seem a bit reckless to challenge him? Especially in the press? - If being reckless gets me a shot at him colour me reckless. - I don't think calling him a coward and unintelligent is productive. - He is a coward. - He's also murdered 5 people and hasn't left a trace of evidence. - Not that we have found yet. - I guess maybe we should all be as productive as you are. - What the hell is that supposed to mean? - We all want to get him, Jeanne. For our own reasons. - Hey, I got here as soon as I could. What's up? - He sent me another message. - "I only chose one writer "so your fame is inevitable. "Your defining moment is here, Kathleen. Don't be afraid. Embrace it." - He wants me to print the story. I'm not sure what to do, Jeanne. I didn't tell anyone about it. But the truth is, it's the story of a lifetime! The national coverage I could get off this would change my world! I may be able to use this as a springboard to a whole new career. Maybe one of those on-air news correspondents at a major network! I mean, my editor would kill me... - What the hell are you thinking? You do understand that the man who wrote this is planning on killing 6 more people, and one tonight? - Yes. But I also understand that if I don't do what he says, he'll come after me. He picked me. Remember? Look, Jeanne. I'm scared. I want to do everything I can to help, but I'm afraid. How do you know that printing that thing won't help? - I don't. My father was wrong and he killed my mother. Run it, don't run it. I don't care what you do, Kathleen. - Where are you going? - I'm going home to find a killer. - Jeanne! [ Beep ] [Kathleen]: Hey Jeanne, I decided not to run it yet but I really need to talk to you about it some more. I'm on my way to yoga class to work out some of this stress. Can I swing by later tonight? Call me if that's OK. Hope you're feeling better. [ Beep ] [ Exhaling ] - Why did he pick you? You're pretty, by why you? Lived alone as a writer... Lived alone as a writer... "Lisa Torbett, believed to have been abducted outside a disco "between 8:00 and 10:00 on Wednesday was made famous as the BPS Killer's 6th victim." "Waitress, student, housewife, secretary, student, writer." She was the only writer. She was the only writer. "I only chose one writer so your fame is inevitable." Oh my God. He's going to kill Kathleen! Oh my God! He's going after Kathleen this time. It's going to be within the hour. It may already be too late. - How do you know? - I don't have time to explain it now. You'll just have to trust me. - Are you sure about this? - As sure I am that he is going to kill again. - What do you need? - The yoga class at the church. Get some units over there right now, please! [ Woman moaning ] [ Woman moaning ] - Police! Freeze! - What the hell are you doing? - We're just making out. It's my boyfriend! - It's OK. It's all right. [ Siren ] Just relax. Stay right there, it's fine. It's fine, it's fine. - It's all right. It's not our man. It's a false alarm. - What the hell happened here, Jeanne? - I blew it. - What's going on, Jeanne? - I thought he was coming after you. - Oh my God. - Back in the car, guys. - You can get back in your car now. - Jeanne? Chief's waiting for you. - Jeanne, come in. This is Agent Diamond from the FBI. - How you doing? - Agent Diamond will be taking over the BPS case. - Ray's brought us up to speed. You've done some pretty impressive work so far. - You can't be serious, Ray. - The Governor told the Feds they can expect our full cooperation. That would include giving them everything you know about BPS. Past and present. - Sure. When pigs fly. - Don't forget your place here, Detective. - Look, I understand how you feel. But this is a matter of experience, not competence, Detective Joyce. We're trained to handle these kinds of cases. - With all due respect, You don't have any idea how I feel. - That's enough! - You're right. That is enough. - Right there, Jeanne! I will not tolerate this kind of insubordination. You understand me? - This is insane, Ray! Nobody knows this case like I do. My entire life has been about getting a shot at this guy and when that happens, you hang me out to dry! Why? Because the Governor makes a call to the FBI just to bolster his poll numbers? - I made the call. - I screwed up last night, Ray. Fine. I had a hunch and I acted on it. You would've done the same thing. Come on. - Maybe I would have. But that doesn't change the situation. You're still off the case. - Why would you do that to me? - Because it's not about you. We need a new set of eyes on this thing. Every piece of evidence indicates that it's BPS but you disregard it like it's a plate of bad clams. He's playing you, Jeanne. And the people of this city are dying on my watch. - Was Fred in on this? - You should go home now, Jeanne. You're suspended until further notice. [ Police radio ] [ Beep ] - You have one message. Message one: - Open your eyes, Linda. Do you see this? Keep your eyes open. Either you watch or Jeannie does. [ Sobbing ] That's better. - I can't do this! For the love of God! Please! - Look at me! I don't want to hurt her, but I will. Whatever you don't watch me do to you I'll do to her. Do you want to protect her from that? - Yes! - Then keep your eyes on the knife. - Hey, partner. - Not anymore. - You know, for what it's worth, I think taking you off the BPS case is a friggin' joke. Can I have a beer? But I don't think that the FBI coming on board is a bad thing. - There go your chances of getting lucky tonight. - If you're going to go that hard on bourbon you should probably get something to eat. - You're a real buzz kill, you know? - Can we have a couple burgers over here, please? - I don't need a nursemaid to sober me up or preach to me the virtues of crimefighting the FBI way. See you on the slab, partner. - Yeah. - Hey! You're not ducking me, are you? - What are you talking about? - I acted like a jerk the other day. - Well... - No, no. I'd like to make it up to you. Why don't you let me make you dinner? - Are you sure that's what you're after, Val? Dinner? [ Chuckling ] - You're drunk. - Well, that's not a bad thing. I'm at my best when I'm drunk. Take me home. - OK. Not like this. [ Chuckling ] Ha! What are you doing? What are you doing? Get the hell off me! [ Screaming ] - Welcome home, Jeanne. I bought it a year ago. The owner died in his sleep one night. - What are you... Ah! - It's the only place we could do it, don't you think? I mean, this is where it all started for you. I underestimated you, Jeanne. I admit it. You almost had me in Rose Park. Don't do anything stupid. You of all people should know how thought out this is. - Mimi! Mimi! - You were your mother's reason to endure. Being your only relative, she'll have to do. Let's hope your courage matches your mother's. - Why are you doing this? [ Muffled yelling ] - Because I love you. I have for some time. This is our destiny, Jeanne. It was decided long before we ever met. - You don't have to kill me, Val. - Of course I do. Killing you is the only way to have it all make sense. It's our 30 year anniversary. - What about my grandmother? - Well, that depends on you. [ Knife sharpening ] - You know who BPS is? [ Laughing ] - Of course I do! It was my father. He was the perfect dad. I really had the best childhood. Only I had something the other kids didn't. A father with godlike power. Deciding who lived and died. - And he passed his power onto you? - Oh. The first photograph he ever showed me was of you. That's when I fell in love with you. I've dreamed of this moment for so long, Jeanne. - Why now? Why start killing now, Val? - I told you! It's our anniversary. Dad taught me the importance of timing and preparation. He was my hero. And I wanted to find a way to pay tribute to him. To bring his genius to a new generation that will appreciate BPS for what he was. A man to be feared. And worshipped. - By killing 5 innocent people? - Innocent? We're all guilty of something, Jeanne. The truth is... dying sometimes... is an answer to pain. - That's what you'll do? Hurt me with a few little burns? I'm disappointed. - You're special, Jeanne. Dad said you would be. - Your dad was sick. You don't have to do this, Val. - My father was an artist. - He was an animal! - Shut your mouth! - Is that how he did it, Val? He beat her and then he burned her later? - You want to see how my father did it? - Yeah. - You can see first hand. I'll love peeling your skin off. - You're pathetic! A disappointment to your demented father! - You're going to beg me to kill you! What now, Jeanne? You seized your moment. Made your move. Just one problem: Soon this room will be an inferno and your grandmother will be burned alive! - Drop it right now! - Come take it from me. You feel that? Feel me squeezing the life out of you? That's power, Jeanne. [ Mimi grunting ] My power! - Let's go next door! Just go! I'll be all right! - Oh! My granddaughter's still inside! - Mimi? Mimi? I'm OK. [ Siren ] It's OK. It's OK. - How's it coming? - Ten years and I can't even fill a box this size. - So there's no chance you'd reconsider, huh? You're too good a cop to just walk away from it all. - I've been a cop since I was 6 years old. Time to think about doing something else. - So what are you going to do now? - I was thinking about getting married, having some kids. Sure get Mimi off my back, wouldn't it? - Jeanne? I like kids.
