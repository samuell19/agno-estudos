Hold on one second, I gotta take off my necklace. Whoo! Mom! Lena! Lena! Lena! This is it. Hey, it's from Natalie. "Welcome to your new home." That's sweet. Sorry. I didn't mean to get you all wet. That's fine, I'll dry. Tobey, where are you? Over here, mom. Beckett, at last, you're here! Hi Natalie. Welcome to your new home. Now I wanted to get you your Hamilton uniform, which I think... oh, good, it's just exactly the right size. Beckett, have you met my son Tobey? Hi. Hey. I thought I heard voices. Hey Tobey, good to see you. Hi Miles, how are you? Thank you so much. It was my ex-husband's. So how's the draft? What draft? The publisher won't wait... Can't sleep? It never gets dark here. Isn't that great? I like the dark. You know, Hamilton is a really good school. We're lucky Nat could get you in. I know it's hard, Beck, but this will be good for us, you know? It's like a fresh start. Okay, dad. Aren't you coming? I don't want to embarrass you. You go on, have fun. Welcome to Hamilton, Rebecca. I am Ms. Neal, your principal. It's Beckett, not Rebecca. Beckett, of course. Ladies, I'd like to introduce Beckett Warner. Say Hello. You can take that seat in the back. Thanks. So...we need to talk about what's happened to our heroine. Sunday? Um...devirginated. And so... So she's without value to her family. Very good... Any other ideas? Hey, new girl. You might want to be careful. I'm Jen. Beckett. So what brings you to Hamilton? I just moved to the city. Is it job or divorce? My mother died. Oh...I'm sorry, that sucks. You dropped this. Everything's gonna be alright. Let's just go to my office and we can talk about it. Beckett? I'm afraid our garden is closed for renovation this year. Sorry. It's okay. Why don't you come with me? Come on. Come on. This is our founder's parlor. Hello. Beckett, come in! She's a Hamilton mother and a member of our board of trustees. How do you do? And this is Vivienne Carpenter. She's in charge of the upper school. We were just talking about your dad. Her father is Miles Warner. Natalie's publishing his new book. Yes. I am such a big fan of your father's. We read his last one... it had beautiful poetry in it. Oh! Beckett? Are you alright? Honey, you alright? Yeah, I just feel dizzy. Let me take you to the nurse's office, ok? Yeah? Come with me. Pamela will fix her right up. I heard about her mother. So sad. Pamela, I think you made a mistake. That's a rectal thermometer. Well, then it's in the right place. You're fine. Thank you, Sunday. No, I'm sick. Help me. Out. You heard her, Chloe, out. I'm going, I'm going. Everything is going to be fine, ok? Come on! Careful, we're all sick here. Hey Chloe, wait up. Would you like to come through? You want to hop on? So you're the new girl, huh? You can call me Pamela. Beckett. Why don't you lie down? How are you feeling? I'm fine. Just a little bit dizzy before. I like your necklace. Thanks, it was my mother's. Have you eaten today? Yeah, probably not enough though. Alright, under your tongue, that's it. I remember my first day here as a student. It was a very long time ago. It gets better. Alright. Well, looks fine. I think you're tired. Why don't you stay here, lie down for a while, and I'll come back and get you. Thank you. Lena! Lena! Lena! It can be quite challenging, but I think it's also quite a gift. We like to think of ourselves a little like a family. Well, that is exactly what she needs right now. What are you doing here? Hey, honey. Your nurse called me. We thought we'd let you sleep for a while. You okay? Yeah. Thank you again for staying with her. It was fine, I was working late anyway. Miles! Natalie! Beckett, how are you feeling? Much better, thank you. Hi, I'm Ms. Lawrence. Nice to meet you. Beckett, hello. Pamela, you ready? We were just looking for you. Get home safe. This is the Hamilton Alumni Book Club. Ladies, shall we resume? It's one way to get your blood pumping on a Friday night. You better make your escape while you can. Thanks again. It was a pleasure to meet you. Your nurse seems nice... for a school nurse. Dad... Hey! What are you doing? Come back here! What is it? We'll get it on Monday, honey. No! Help me. No, no, no...No! Beckett! Oh my God. Beckett, mind if I come in? Oh, hi. I wanted to see how you were doing. Fantastic. I found this in my office. I thought you might be missing it. Thank you. Your father, he mentioned that the police had been here again. Yeah, I told them that I had seen Sunday cutting herself. I should have -- I should have said something earlier. Beckett, she had been suffering for a while. It was me who should've done more...not you. Pamela brought us some dinner. You hungry? A little. Beckett told me that you were also a Hamilton girl. I was. When did you realize that it was your vocation to heal teenagers? This is really good. Well, I was studying botanical medicine in Paris, where, incidentally, I read part of your first book. Why not the whole book? Distracted. How? I fell in love. Oh yeah, that'll do it. And? He died. So are you taking Beckett out of Hamilton? Probably. No. Dad, I don't want to run away. You sure about this? Yeah, I'm sure. Alright then. Good, that's good. Honey, you okay? Uh...yeah, I'm fine. I think I'm just going to go to bed. Goodnight, sweetie. Thank you for having me. You feeling better? Dad...Yeah, I'm alright. How late did Pamela end up staying? She left pretty soon after you drifted off. It was nice of her to come see you. Yeah. So Beckett, do you know what I do? You're a psychiatrist. Yeah, and in the wake of Sunday Wilson's death, I'll be seeing students on a weekly basis. Did you treat Sunday? Yes, I did. Do you think about Sunday a lot? Yes. Why she killed herself, and if she was scared, what she was so scared of exactly. What do you think she was scared of? I don't know. Aren't you the one who talked to her every day? That's Sunday's mom. Wow...she's so good at being sad. Is that a horrible thing to say? Her daughter almost squished you. You can say whatever the hell you want. I can't believe that Pamela ate at your apartment. Her like great-great-great, or something, grandmother founded this school so she inherited like mad amounts of money. Are she and your dad like boning hard yet? What, Jen? I'm sorry. Was that rude? Do you think that Chloe knew Sunday was going to jump? I mean, they were best friends. They had a pact to stay virgins together. I don't know. I kind of wish I knew Sunday better. Ok, well, you could always ask Tobey. He used to go out with her. You know him? Do you like him or -- It's sine, not cosine. Thanks. So, uh, Jen says you dated Sunday? Um, not really. I mean, we held hands and fed each other French fries for a summer, but you know, that's about it. I'm sorry, I... Let's go! Now. What floor is yours? 12th one. Come on, let's go. Hi Eddie. Hey, ladies. Hi. Jen? Beckett... This is my mother. Beckett, so nice to meet you. You, too. Did you eat yet, honey? Yes, Ava. What did you have? Salad. Okay. This is all she does all day, like go to the gym and take vitamins, and stay hydrated, not with water of course. Do you see the way that she looks at me? It's like I'm mold, like, she's like disgusted that I've grown this far. Jen, your room, I really like it. Thanks. Kent says it's really important for me to create my own world because Ava is an alcoholic. Well, my dad's an alcoholic. What if they went to meetings together sometime? I wish. How long have you been seeing Dr. Kent? Once a week since I was little. Ava figured if I didn't have a dad, then I should at least have like a steady therapist. She and Kent went to school together. Come on. Let's get you out of that uniform. These are cute. Kick it, kick flip it. You can get higher than that. Hey Jenski. Hirsch, what are you doing? Just go sit over there. You know, I bet I can flip this chip from here using only my tongue. If that chip leaves your mouth, I'm going to dismember you. Yes, please! Hello again. Hi. You skate? Not really. You should try. Okay. There you go. Want to learn? You want to teach me? Hey, Pamela just dropped by to see you. I thought you'd be home sooner. Hey. Hi. She's kicking my ass. What is this? Where? How did I miss that? Come on, stay and help me. I'm tired, I think I'm going to go to bed. Well, then I'm out of here, too. Beckett, I wanted to give you something. I just thought it would look incredible on you. I couldn't resist it. This is really pretty. Thank you! You're welcome. Dad? Help me. Help me comb my hair. Please help me. Help me! Help me! It's ok, baby, it's alright. Wake up, baby, wake up, come on. There you go. Just a bad dream. It's alright, baby. It's ok, it's ok. I...had a dream about Sunday last night. Yeah? She asked me to comb her hair. Did you comb her hair? I wanted to. You wanted to? Beckett, who used to comb your hair? My mom. Nice. Do you sometimes feel you could've helped your mom? She had an aneurysm. There was nothing I could do. That's true but is that how you feel or is that how you think you should feel? I don't know. You don't have to know. You just let your feelings come out when they're ready. In the meantime, I'm going to write a prescription. It'll help you sleep. Hi. Brought you my old deck. That's goofy, that's goofy style. I like being goofy. Basically the trick to the ollie is it's basically like a one-footed jump, but the second that the tail hits the ground, you're up off the board and then your front foot slides forward and levels the board out so -- I'll just show you. Here, why don't you try? I got you. That's good, that's really good. You can't overthink it though, you just gotta put the moves down and just... That was good... sort of. No, no, no, please not by myself. Hi. Where were you? I was at the park with Jen and Tobey. I texted you. Is that why you smell like pot? I don't know, I guess some kids were smoking -- It won't mix with your prescription, Beck. Dad, I don't smoke pot. And on school nights, I want you home by seven from now on. I don't need you to tell me to do my homework. Good. Miles... Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Natalie, she persuaded your father to read at our benefit and he's not too thrilled about it...and I think he misses you. Beckett...are you taking your pills? Good. Anymore nightmares? No... but sometimes I hear these sounds that aren't there. Do you see things? There you are, I was waiting for you. Come on, let's get out of here. You've done this before, right? Yeah, and I'm very hygienic, you know that. Ok, go for it. Tobey is going to love this. It's not for him. Right. Gloves, ice, extra alcohol, extremely clean needle. Just count to 15. One, two, three, four...ow...five... Beautiful. So, let's see it. Okay. That's not bad. You must have a pretty amazing teacher. Where? Now you just have to teach me how to surf. I don't surf anymore. Why's that? Because of my mom. Right. I'm sorry, that was a stupid question. It's okay. I think you'd be a good surfer. So, you wanna come over? Today was fun. Yeah, it was. Literally, five seconds, I swear to God. Just dedicate it to the color of... You're bleeding. It's okay. Sit down. Let's see it. It's might sting a little. There, all better. Thanks, nurse. Tobey, turn it down -- Jeez, mom, knock. Beckett, you need to go home...now. Hey. Where's my dad? He's at a meeting. We got some review copies in at the book club. Natalie called. We weren't doing anything. Listen, if you rush into something that should be so beautiful, it can turn ugly. Do you understand? Does my dad know about this? No, and he doesn't need to if you promise me not to rush into anything with Tobey. Can you do that? Yes. Goodnight, Beckett. Goodnight. Help me. Help me! So when are you going to see Tobey again? Never if Natalie and Pamela get their way. Well, we can be pure as the driven snow together then. Why is that? Hirsch was with Chloe last night. 36... Help me. So Dr. Kent bailed on our session. I was going to see if you wanted to come over. Is everything okay? Jen, it happened before. What? Ew, gross, I think my mom actually knew those girls. Um, I have to go. Beckett? Beckett. Bye. I was wondering if you knew these two girls. No, I didn't know them. Because Ava said that she knew them and I know you guys went to school together so... Yes, Ava and I did, but she was in a different class. She's a few years older than me. Beckett, I really wouldn't believe too much of what Ava says to you. She's having some personal issues right now. I'm sure you've noticed. You should get back to class. Only when Odysseus comes home is the heroic cycle completed. That's what I want you to write about. A cycle from your own life. Write something brave. Like, brave how? Chloe. Chloe! Those flowers that you were drawing before in class... Sunday, she had them in her hair the day she died. Look, Beckett, I don't want to play with you. Where did you find this? Someone mentioned it to me so I looked it up. So you're drawing a connection between these two girls who drowned and Sunday. I'm not drawing a connection. There is a connection. They all went to Hamilton and they all killed themselves. So what is it about Hamilton that makes students want to kill themselves? I'm not quite sure yet. Dad? I really don't want to read. Do I have to read? Yes. Where's my tie? I know it's here. Hey honey. Come on. It's time to go. Beautiful. Beckett, you look beautiful. Miles, very nice. Where's Tobey? He's home. He was swamped with schoolwork. He was very sorry to miss you. Come on in. Thank you. Semper et aeternum. Always and forever. Beckett, if you'll just excuse us for a moment. I'm just tired, I'm tired of all this. You're not tired, Ava, you're drunk. Hello...I know I've seen you before. Have you lived in Perugia? No, I'm afraid I haven't. Perhaps it was somebody who looked like me. I'm sorry to interrupt -- Please no, please don't be angry at me. We're not angry at you. We're disappointed. Malia, Malia! Don't call me that, don't call me that. You need to go to sleep. You'll be better in the morning. Come on, let's go outside. It's locked. I got mom's keys. What's wrong? Beck? Where are you going? Beck? Hey, I've been looking for you everywhere. Where have you been? I thought that you were at home studying? I am. Do you have a key for this one? Yeah, of course. Your mom just left the keys where you could find them? That's kind of weird. What are you looking for? Relax. What is this? It's a Shirley Temple. Ah, it's gross. How can you drink that? I think it's delicious. Your loss. Don't lay down on that, Tobey. It's disgusting. It's fine, they clean it. This place is kinda creepy. You can go back out if you want, Jen. Why is it I don't like that idea? What are you doing? I'm trying to figure out what kind of pills Pamela is giving to Chloe. This is Vicodin. Excellent. Hey, maybe we should not be going through Pamela's meds. Can we just go? Stop complaining. Am I interrupting something? I wasn't feeling well so I was just looking for something to help with the pain. Tobey, Jen, will you go rejoin the others please? We really weren't doing anything, Pamela. Sunday, she gave me this the day she died. My family have been looking after this school for generations, Beckett. These are private keepsakes. Do you understand? Are you testing me, Beckett? Breaking into a school office crosses a line that you can't cross! Do you understand? Yes. I already told you I wasn't feeling well. Beckett, do not lie to me. Dad, do you not see what's been going on here? What? She was giving pills to Sunday, okay, and now she's trying to give them to Chloe, too. Will you just listen to me? She's the school nurse, Beckett. If a student is taking prescribed medication, It's more than that and you're not listening! What more than that? What are you talking about? Pamela, explain to her what you do. What is she talking about? Beckett, do not walk away from me. Rebecca, I am trying to talk to you. Rebecca? Rebecca, I am trying to talk to you. What is that? It's nothing. That is a hunk of metal in your belly button. You know what, Dad, it's mine...Mine! So get out! Can I talk with her, please, Miles? Get out! You know, you really remind me of myself when I was your age. You're so stubborn. I am nothing like you, whatever you are. Beckett, honey? Talk to me, Beckett, talk to me, talk to me. It's okay, it's alright. It's okay, baby, it's okay, baby. I'm here, it's okay. It's gonna be okay, it's gonna be okay, alright. There you go. I'll be back pretty late so the deal is, you're not going to leave the apartment, right? Okay. I love you. Hey Hirsch. Do you trust me? You gotta try this. Just stay cool and wait...trust me. Hey. Hold on. Hey. Hi. Um, can you come over? It's really important. I don't think I can. Tobey, I'm serious, I really need you to come over. Wait, what's wrong? I don't want to tell you on the phone. I have to show you something. Beckett, what's going on? Get over here now. Who is it? It's me. What is that? Wake up. You're still pure aren't you, Beckett? Beckett, wake up. You're just dreaming. Beckett, it's me. Your father asked me to check in on you. Have you taken your medication today? Yeah. You...drugged me. Beckett, you cut yourself. I'm just going to clean it, okay? No! Hey, just, you lie still. No. I'm worried you're going to hurt yourself, okay? It's okay, calm down. Get off me! Stop it. You're one of them. You know what, you're upset and I totally understand that, but I am not going to hurt you, I promise. God...you scared me. It's beautiful. What is it? It's for you. Hey, what's wrong? Tobey, I want you to know that if anything ever happened to me, I would never do anything to hurt myself, okay? Beckett, what's going on? You won't believe me. Of course I will. It's Pamela and the book club... They're trying to kill me, Tobey. I got you, didn't I? Beckett...we don't have to do this. I want to. Hey. I wasn't sure if you were ever going to wake up. Can I borrow a shirt? Yeah. I should probably get going. Your mom is going to wake up soon. She's not going to be back until later tonight after the book club meeting. Book club is tonight? Yeah, why? Tobey, I need to borrow your phone, okay? Beck, what's going on? I'm sorry. This is nuts. Miles, I know this is hard, but this is what kids... How could this happen? This is what kids do. She'll be home when she's ready. Trust me. It's Beckett. Everyone's like freaking out and looking for you. Don't freak out. I'll explain later. I just need you to meet me. Can you please meet me? Why are you on Tobey's phone? Jen? I'm going to call you back in like two minutes, okay? No, don't hang up! Hi sweetie. Hi mom. You look so beautiful. What's going on? Oh sorry. Is Jen home? I think she's in her room. Jen? Jen! Jen? Jen? Hey, it's me. Tobey, they have Jen. No, no, we have to help her. I think they're going to kill her, Tobey. Please believe me. I'm really scared. Can you meet me by the tunnel? Okay, when it's dark. Hello? Hey Jen, it's Tobey. Tobey? Is everything okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Just here with mummy, bored out of my mind. So you're sure you're okay? Mm-hmm. Okay, gotta go. Okay...freak. Tobey! Tobey, we have to go, okay? Beckett, wait. What's wrong? Beckett. They're gonna help you, Beck, they'll take you somewhere safe. Tobey cares about you a great deal. Don't make this harder on him than it has to be. This is yours. Come on. I'm sorry. Stop! Pamela? Pamela? I can't wait anymore. You didn't answer your phone. We have to do something. I didn't answer my phone because I was talking with Beckett. Where is she? I don't know. She didn't say, but she's safe and she promised me that she would call you later tonight. Oh God. It's alright. It's alright. This is Beckett's. Well, I don't know how it got here. Are you sure she was wearing it? Yeah! I have so much filing to do. Yeah, well, I guess I'll go home and wait for her call. If I get all this finished in time, I'll come home and we'll be together. Alright, it's fine. It's time. Jen? You're going to be just fine. I want you to know that you will be with me forever. No...no, please. Somebody, please! Help! Shhh... I will not feed you. Alverna... When I left her in your care, she was pure. It's not my fault, she ran away. Your blood is worthless to me now... but my blood, it can help you live. Don't be afraid. Taste it... No, no. Join us. You're mine, you're mine. Let's go. Beckett, it's okay, I'm right here. Beckett, it's over.
