(WOMAN EXCLAIMING) (SPEAKING GERMAN) (YELLS) WOMAN: There is major internal tissue damage. I'm not promising we can repair it, but if we don't try, Leo will never be able to talk. Your son deserves that we do our best. I understand you have your own beliefs, but sometimes the good Lord does his best work through human hands. (CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY) LEO'S MOTHER: No. (IN GERMAN) Come, my child, help me. He'll be fine. We just need to get him home. God will heal Leo.

(AUTOMATED VOICE) Please watch your heads. FlyMeal coming through. You really don't mind eating this again? It's comfort food, you know? Here. (CLEARS THROAT) Don't get me wrong. I really love your very... peculiar way of living, but... it would make things so much easier. It's the oldest, simplest phone I could find. (PHONE CHIMES) Wow! (LAUGHS) So that's where you... Wait, let me show it to you. (PHONE CHIMES) So... Okay, that's how you turn it on, and... (NAADIRAH LAUGHS) (CHUCKLES) What? Leo, stop hiding. You are so beautiful. Da stargo tora. The black of my eyes. Da stargo tora. Means "the thing that makes me feel beautiful." (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) - Hi! - Hi. (ALL CHEERING) One more? That's a real sexy hood ornament you got dancing up there tonight. Upstairs. I need two more of those. That's my favorite so far. But it's too easy. Make me a sea horse. - ROB: Here you are, mate. Here she comes. - Come on, love. - Thank you. - Thank you very much. Ladies. ROB: Here, love. My man's got a question for you. I'm wondering if the top matches the bottom. ROB: Isn't he charming? - Just take that. - LUBA: Hey, Naadirah. - Hey, pretty girl. - LUBA: Naadirah, let's go take a break. Come on. - She loves it. - Loves it. So, did Nicky talk to you? - Yeah. - How much money you have saved so far? - Not enough. - And why isn't he helping? He doesn't know. Luba, get off the car. What? He doesn't know? Wow! Mute and dumb. What a catch. You haven't brought him over. I hope it's got nothing to do with me. Luba. You can put a sock on the door handle so I know not to come in. Or wait till I'm asleep. I know he'll be quiet. Stop. Why the hell can't he talk anyway? It's complicated. It's his mother's fault. He needs surgery. It's against her beliefs. If my mom tried to stop me talking, I would fuck her up. - And she's in a wheelchair. - (LAUGHS) He doesn't need words. He's kind. Why wouldn't I love him? Love? Yeah. I didn't do that? - (CLICKS TONGUE) Aw, Luba... - No. - I'm gonna go back inside. - Wait, wait. So who did Nicky suggest? Oswald. It doesn't matter how close you rub up against Grace, Luba, you will never be as beautiful as her. (LUBA GROANS) - Get off my car. - Okay. - Back to work. Let's go. - Fine. Blue is my favorite lollipop color. I just lick 'em like... You know what I think? Maybe I didn't offer enough money. - Get your hands off me. - This goes easier if you don't fight... - Get your hands off me. - Who do you think... Hey! What you doing? Hey! Rob! Rob! - What you doing? Hey! - It's all right. Leave him be. - I didn't know she was your woman. - Leave him be. Get your hands off him! - You all right? - Yeah, he took my money, man. - Fucking thief. - ROB: Never put your hands on me. - This is expensive shit. - It's not worth it. Leo. Leo. Leo! I can't lose this job. TOBY: Yeah, listen to your bitch, Leo. (LEO BREATHING HEAVILY) ROB: Yeah, go on. Keep walking, lanky prick. TOBY: Yeah, get out, man. Fucker. (OVERLAPPING CHATTER) TOBY: Hey, don't push me! (AUTOMATED VOICE) Welcome. Please take your seats and fasten your seat belts. TOBY: Yeah? That's what your mom liked. (CHIMING) Hello? Oh, yeah. All right. All right. Getting it. Thank you. Hey, lover boy. Let's go. MAKSIM: I built my dream here, piece by piece. My car, my club, my security. Not easy. If you interfere with what I have made... One warning. One. I don't want to see you in here again. (STATIC ON RECORD PLAYER) (MUFFLED INDISTINCT CHATTER) (STATIC STOPS) (MUFFLED CHATTER CONTINUES) (SIGHS) Something happened tonight. No. No, I'm not hurt. But I... I need to tell you something. Someone I... I need to tell you about someone. But no! No, I'm not leaving you, but I... I have to tell you something about me. God, Leo. The last thing I want to do is leave you. What are you always doodling in there? A bed? A bed for us? (TRAIN RUMBLING) Leo, where are we going? It's freezing cold. Leo, do you have a car? (THUNDER CRASHING) It's like it's from a fairy tale. I don't deserve you, Leo. I love you. I love you so much. I always will. But you don't know me. DUCK: Maybe if she saw Josie more, she'd get off your back. You're down here half the time. CACTUS: She's my daughter. She stays with me. DUCK: What does Josie want? Hold on. I can't see shit. You know what? We're gonna have to cut these pants right off. CACTUS: She's a kid. She does what she's told. Her mom can kiss my Yankee ass. DUCK: I'm trying to save this leg. CACTUS: I'll make it up to Josie when we get back to New York. Oh, what fun panties. - DUCK: Club camo? - CACTUS: And they work with the garters. DUCK: What do you have in here? Are you throwing this out? CACTUS: Junk. Leave it. You know, I can see the shell, - I just can't... - (MAN GROANS) - CACTUS: Yeah, yeah... - DUCK: Easy... I know. It hurts all over. CACTUS: Put weight on it. - (MAN GROANS) - (CACTUS CHUCKLES) That, my myopic friend, is a .38. DUCK: My, my. So it is. You got eyes like a hawk. Leave those baby blues to me. I'll recycle them. Checkmate. - CACTUS: Want to chuck some rock later? - DUCK: Sure do. Is good? - CACTUS: He was shot five times? - Gunther... (SPEAKING GERMAN) - Da. Five. - Yeah. Well, then... is good. Old slim here's gonna be ready to rob and roll before you know it. Go on, close him up. DUCK: An honor and a pleasure, my friend. - Is this guy family or one of your goons? - Not family. No. Make the stitches big. AKIM: No one in my family is stupid enough to get shot five times. CACTUS: Yeah? Tell him to get the fuck out of the way the next time, because I don't plan on sticking around to help him sort out his social life. So, you leave soon? I don't know, Akim. Do I? Boss says two days. Three at most. DUCK: That sounds like an excuse, babe. It does, right? I mean, that's an awful lot. Still, it's gotta be nice, right? Having a surgeon on call? All private and such? (CHUCKLES) Well, that is me. Miller time. How about you, Akim? Want a little drink? Black Russian, maybe? (LAUGHS) If he say he get you out of country, he get. It's delicate. Maksim has to be careful, yes? He doesn't want trouble from military police. - You are a-hole. - (LAUGHS) AWOL. Yeah. See, I'm AWOL. You're a-hole. Expensive to make American soldier disappear. Especially now. Lots of work. But he likes you, Cactus. Relax. Is not going to be problem. Oh, goody. 'Cause the sooner I am out of this shit stain of a country, the better. If you hate Germany so much, why are you here? He joined a fraternity. Wanna-be-a-papa. Don't be a fuckin' AWOL.

I mean, you did that. It's... it's pretty impressive. I thought you and Naadirah were trying to pull some disappearing act to get away from me. You really are looking for her. Aren't you? What, you like these? Don't worry, they come off. You can borrow them. Yeah. Yeah. Love is fucking crazy, man. She needed money, and I told her I would get it because... I hate myself enough to do that for her. Would you? Do you really love her that much? Would you do anything for her? Anything? If she's not with me, why would she be with you? What are you? You're nothing. She's gone. She took the money that I made for her and she left! And now... Now Maksim knows what I did. (SIGHS) Fuck, I need to get out of here. Do you want help in finding Naadirah? I know you're not that big on technology, but do you know what this is? I shouldn't be here. I need to tell you something. There's something you need to know about me. I shouldn't be here.

Now... glasses, purse... Would you be a dear and watch my things for a minute while I go and get my biscuit? It's called a fucking cookie! Oh! Hello. Did you bring your mom with you? No, that's the new girl at the parlor. I thought she'd make a nice change of pace for you. Is that for me? Maksim called. What's he want? He wants us to put the squeeze on Nicky Simsek. Nicky? That's heavy. He's a bad boy. But I thought he was team Maksim. What gives? Asshole wants to find out what Nicky's been doing behind his back. And you watch. I'm not gonna make a goddamn mark from this thing. What did Nicky do? Oh... (STAMMERS) The fuck knows. I... Besides, Maksim's being all rapey about it. "Do this to his ass. Do this to his ass. Do that..." When did torture get so gay? Jesus. You know, I've had training. Years have gone into these hands. Now, I'm wasting it on this Spanish Inquisition bullshit. That mute bartender was with Nicky. They were probably just making very small talk. - That's funny. - (CHUCKLES) You know, I think that freak is looking for Naadi. Good luck with that. What do you mean? Nothing. Just... I hope he finds her, so everyone can mellow the fuck out. - What do you wanna do about Nicky? - Well... I say, we just slice the guy a new fucking Jap's eye and see what the son of a bitch has to say. Hold on just a second. Lady, why don't you stare at your fucking tea, because the next time you give me that stink eye, I'm gonna take that cup and ram it so far up your snatch, it'll look like you grew a third ear. That way. Jesus. People are so fucking rude. You sure you want our help with this? You seem to be doing a fine job beating the shit out of him without us. - You want him on the table, babe? - Yeah. Put a sheet on it first. DUCK: Thank you very much. MAKSIM: Cactus! How are you? Maksim. Where are my fucking IDs? Tomorrow. What is it? German Valentine's Day? For your daughter. It's Trippies Sugar Bombs. Come on. I know how much you miss home. Trippies! I feel bad. I didn't bring anything for you. MAKSIM: So, this is where you work? Not much, but it's home. - Who's this? - This is Duck. We used to sleep together. DUCK: Don't give him the wrong impression. We were in Kabul together. Did a tour of duty. Shared a bunk. Where we touched penises. - Duck, how are you, my friend? - Nice to finally meet you. - Do you need papers too? - Oh, no. No, sir. No, I served all my time. (CHUCKLES) How are you? This fucking mother-sucker... Nicky has been sending girls out on personal business. I want to know what the deal is Nicky has with this crazy bartender. This kind of thing hurts my reputation. You know what, Maksim? I don't care how many discos you own, - you're still a dirty communist to me. - Hey! (SCOFFS) You are a bitter man, Bill. Like the world owes you something so much better. But you live pretty good life. You have a beautiful daughter, a nice house, women, friends. I pay you good money. You are living the dream. Trust me. Be a little more courteous, Cactus. I make your life possible. DUCK: Don't take it personally, boss. Cactus has been a dick to everybody lately. Then take it out on this asshole. (GRUNTS) MAKSIM: Duck, do whatever you have to. Whatever Nicky says, record and give to Gunther. He'll stay with you. It's your money. And, Maksim, I want those fucking IDs in the system. Passports, new birth certificate for Josie. Certified data in the fucking net. No problem. No problem. (IMITATES MAKSIM) "No problem." "No problem." "No problem." (IN NORMAL VOICE) Think I'm giving that poison to Josie? They're called Sugar Bombs, for fuck's sake. What an asshole. DUCK: This is all just about finding Naadirah. We know why the Mouth was hassling this guy. He's not gonna tell us anything new. Maksim needs to hear what he needs to hear. He's got some cockamamie story in his head? Let's give him just that. Well, that's kinda harsh on slick here, you know? Maybe give him a shot. Take the edge off? CACTUS: No. Not with the book club over there. It's gotta sound real. Well... - (NICKY WHIMPERS) I haven't done anything. - It's been a blast, Nicky. You are one unlucky son of a bitch. My daddy always did say, "Girls are nothing but trouble." (SCREAMING LOUDLY) Ducky boy! Hey, Duck, where you at? (TAPS KEYPAD) Hey. When did you get here? "Itty-bitty titties," huh? Jesus Christ. Are you high? Stay the fuck away from my daughter. Don't talk to her. Don't touch her. Don't even look at her. As far as you're concerned, she doesn't exist. Got it? What the fuck, Bill? I know what you are, you sick son of a bitch. And I got a good idea what was going on in Kabul too. - What the fuck are you talking about? - I saw your cameras. Oh, come on, man. The fucking cameras are for patients. I use them for work. How long has it been going on? I... I just installed them. I haven't even recorded anybody. Don't lie to me. I just saw a little girl... Ow! ...naked on your screen. You gonna lie to me now? I... I was... I was just messing around. Like, as a game... "A game"? No. Basketball's a game. Tiddlywinks is a game. Bowling is a fucking game, Donald! - Well... - This is gonna stop, right now. The minute you're thinking, while you're thinking of something? You're thinking of it. But the second you do something, that is a world of pain, my friend. I know. I... - No, you don't. Clearly, you don't know. - (GROANS) Here's what's gonna happen. You are done treating kids. There are plenty of other doctors that can do it. No child is going to step foot in this fucking room ever again. Okay. You wanna know what else? Now I know. What does that mean? Means it ain't a secret anymore. The second that you do something, or the second that I think that you're even thinking about doing something, I am going to break your fucking arms. From your shoulders all the way down to your fingernails. - Jesus, Bill. - Got it? What the... - Got it? - Yes, I... - Got it? - Yes. I... I... Yes. I will. I will try. (GROANS) Fuck. (STAMMERS) Don't. I'll do it. I'll stop. I promise. I promise I'll stop. I promise. (STAMMERING) And I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Come here. Fuck. I love you, brother. All right? I won't let anything happen. Yeah. Talk to me, Maksim. Mmm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Huh? Tell me when and I'll pick 'em up. All right. Yeah, thanks, Maksim. Thank you. I got my papers. Josie's, mine. Everything. Well, that's great. Yeah. It's great. (BOTH CHUCKLE) We're gonna celebrate. Grab your shit. We're going to the mall. - (LAUGHING) - ("DIG THAT CRAZY SANTA CLAUS" PLAYING) ♪ With his red suit on ♪ Fuck you! ♪ Oh man, oh man, he's really gone ♪ ♪ Dig that crazy Santa Claus ♪ ♪ With his bag of toys ♪ DOCTOR ON CALL CACTUS: Oh, my God!

I got a plan. Lay it on me. I wanna give you the house. Cactus, no. The house, man. It's yours. Cactus... It's perfect. Look... Get rid of the surgery. Get rid of that whole kids cyberwear deal. Ah, yeah, all right. Give yourself a little perspective on things. - Hey, I have to make money, babe. - Exactly, from Maksim. - That fucking Russian prick? No way. - He needs a surgeon and I'm gone. He's met you. He knows that I trust you. Come on, man. It's pulling rounds and sewing tears. - You could do it in your sleep. - I don't know. You'll be doing the same amount of work, but getting paid double. Look, you sell the clinic? You got it made in the shade, buddy. I can't believe you're really going, babe. End of an era. Fuckin' A. To you, my friend. You, sir, I love. - The band in the sand. - Band in the sand. Fuck it. Let's get laid. My treat. We gotta stop and get Josie first. Kanwal wants to take off early. Uh-huh. Hey, Cactus... I wanna thank you for everything. Oh, shut up. Have a peanut. No, hey... Thank you. I'm serious, man. Thank you. Gonna miss you. I'm gonna miss you too, babe. (BOTH CHUCKLE) Hey, I'm sorry I've been such a dick lately. I've had a lot on my mind. Hey, listen. I gotta tell you something too. I'm kind of fucking with that mute bartender. Leo. Just, you know, like, on the phone. (LAUGHS) - Why would you do that? - (MAN EXCLAIMS IN GERMAN) Like you said, you were kind of being a dick. He could've fucked everything up. Hey, relax. He's a goof. Asshole. Hey! Hey! Excuse me, please. - Who is this? - (CACTUS CHUCKLES) She's a jealous little Nazi. (BOTH LAUGH) Hey, hey, stop! You're just not our type, okay? God, what is wrong with her? Penis envy. You must pay, sir. What, did they have a half day at school today? Huh? Who says I should pay for this? You? You says? Is that it? I'm talking to you, not your faggot friends. I've got a better idea. How about I just eat all of them? And that way, there's no fucking evidence. Hmm? You are under arrest. (LAUGHS) Okay, why don't you grow a foot and come back and talk to me man-to-man? Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! You mean business? How's this for business? Fifty cents worth of candy? How about I pop out your pupil and put the change in the socket? DUCK: Cactus, don't fuck up your last night in Berlin. Cactus, come on. Come on. - (GRUNTS) - That's for fucking with my shit. (WHIMPERS) Please. (SPEAKS GERMAN) Please. Please. There you go. It's a little word, but it makes such a difference. (LAUGHS) (INHALES DEEPLY) It's a crime to be so selfish when there's so much of me to go round, right? What's happened to your lip? Oh, um... I tripped. Such a klutz. Have you ever played seesaw? - You don't know seesaw? - KANWAL: No. DUCK: They have seesaws here, right? Yeah. DUCK: Never taken Josie to a park all this time in Berlin? I'm gonna teach you girls everything. I'm gonna teach you... kick the can, monkey in the middle. - Oh, I'd love to. - Yeah? Teach you four square? Ever played? - Let's go. - No. If we play four square, we might need some more rubbers. Come on. Let's go. You okay? Yeah, yeah. Fucking fantastisch. Maksim, talk to me. All right, I'm gonna be there in 15 minutes. (SIGHS) Do you think you could... WOMAN: Josie? Hmm. Sure, she can stay. She's no trouble. DUCK: That's it, baby girl. You want more? You know what? It's all right. I'm gonna take her with me. Hey, wanna go for a ride with Daddy? Yeah? Bye-bye. (SPEAKING GERMAN) (IN GERMAN) Hey, isn't that Maksim's car? What? I can't believe it.

He's looking for you. He has your address. Where are the documents? Where the fuck are my IDs, Maksim? He took them. Took them. MAN (ON TV): Yeah, I'll give her a surprise. A big surprise. (ROAR ON TV) Got your seat belt on, sweetie? MAN (ON TV): What's going on in here? CACTUS: Duck! You hear me? He's got my papers and he's got my address. - I'm dropping Josie at the... Move! - (CAR HONKING) I'm dropping Josie at the parlor and then I'm home. Meet me there.

(NICKY GRUNTING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (WHISPERS) Wait here. I'll be right back. (BLOWS KISS) (MUFFLED BREATHING) You think I'm gonna let you take my daughter away from me? Huh? That's insane. You're crazy. You're a crazy fucking bitch, you know that? She's family. She's my blood. I'll kill you before I let that happen. You're evil! You are evil! (MUFFLED BREATHING) You need time to get your mind right, Naadi. That's it. (MUFFLED BREATHING CONTINUES) You need a lot of time.

Hey, can you make me some bookshelves? I take your silence as a "no." (LEO GASPS) Where do you think you're going, you big, dumb son of a bitch? You gonna give me some trouble, big boy? Huh? Or are you gonna channel that famous Amish Gelassenheit serenity? (LAUGHS) (SIGHS) Jeez. What the fuck did she ever see in a fruitcake like you? Fuck you. Fucking mute freak. (GURGLING) (SNIFFLES) (INAUDIBLE) Lose your keys, Cactus? Shit. Oh, fuck, man. Oh. - (GURGLING) - (DUCK STAMMERS) - (GURGLING) - Oh, that's bad, babe. (GURGLING CONTINUES) I don't think there's anything I can do here. Maybe I can... Maybe if I got you back to my place or maybe a hospital, where I... Is that what... You want a hospital? Oh, I don't think so, babe. I... They'll talk. They'll say something. They'll call the police. No, you don't want that, babe. NAADIRAH (ON SPEAKER): Leo, stop hiding. You are so beautiful. Da stargo tora. The black of my eyes. (GURGLING CONTINUES) Why'd you have to kill Naad, babe? You had it made. All this over a broad? You're smarter than that. I always knew your temper was gonna get you into trouble. You should have been nicer to me, Bill. (GURGLING CONTINUES) (GURGLING) DUCK: There you two lovebirds are. - You and I need to have a talk. - (GRUNTS) (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING) You know who had a great voice? My grandpa. Smoked three packs a day. Had to have his voice box removed. When you start out, you're gonna sound something like that. - (MACHINE SQUAWKING) - (CHUCKLES) Big fella like you is gonna need a deeper voice than that, right? (SQUAWKING DEEPENS) Yeah. (INDISTINCT CHATTER ON TV) DUCK: She's watching cartoons. Kids, right? (CHUCKLES) You killed that little girl's dad. Hmm? You did that. Not me. You. You should apologize. (LEO'S AUTOMATED VOICE) Stop the pain. I'm so sorry I killed your buddy Cactus. Yeah, well, you should be sorry. Say you're sorry. Fucking say it! There. - (MUFFLED GASPING) - (MACHINE WHIRRING) (GAGS) - Now, say it. - (GASPS) DUCK: Say it. I got an idea. I'm gonna show you something. DUCK: ...then dip into France, we can go anywhere. We can go to Florence, we can go to London, go to Cannes... see all the movie stars. Let's just say we can have a lot of fun, baby. A lot of fun. Morning, sir. Was wondering when you might be joining us. You look beat. (CHUCKLES) Oh, uh, Josie, this is Leo. Leo, this is Josie. The young lady and I were just discussing the splendors of the Cote d'Azur. You have any tales you'd like to regale us with? Stories of the French high life? Nothing? Josie, how about you? Nothing? Huh. You may have your father's eyes, but you do not have his knack for conversation. It's supposed to be fun. You're supposed to be having fun. (AUTOMATED VOICE) Hi, Bill. Your battery is at 37%. Anything? Go ahead, say something. Did all that work. (DUCK LAUGHS) All right, you stay in the car, darling. Uncle Duck's gotta drop Leo off. (GROANS) (PANTING) You recognize this place? No? Your photo of Naadirah... I took it... here. Bill and I used to come up here with Naadi in the summer with her friends, back in the day. She was a real hottie back then. Before she got all fucking knocked up. You see that? Ain't that the sweetest thing? It's funny, you know, because now... they're together forever because of you. You did that. Fucking you! Well, I tried, Bill! Fucking goon's got a heart of stone. Looks high. Shit! I chopped your girlfriend's tits off and I wore them as fucking earmuffs! Fucking say it. You fucking say it. You fucking say it! You fucking say it. "I'm sorry, Duck. I'm sorry about your friend." - (LEO INHALES DEEPLY) - "I'm sorry that I did that to him." (GRUNTS, GASPS) Get the fuck off of me! Get the fuck off! (MUFFLED GRUNTING) (MUFFLED GRUNTING) (GASPING) JOSIE: Leo! Leo! Leo, are you okay? (DISTORTED) No! Josie, get back! It's dangerous! It's dangerous. You sound funny.
