(LOUD REVELRY) (REVELRY CONTINUES) (GRUNTS) We have killed Babylonians! (CHEERING) We have killed Mesopotamians! (ALL CHEERING) We have killed Assyrians, Mycenaeans, Sumerians. But we have never had the pleasure of killing an Akkadian. (GRUNTS) Which limb do I take first? May the gods have pity on you because my brother will not. (GROWLS) (SCREAMING) Boo. (ALL SCREAMING) (YELLING) You missed. (YELLING) You're lucky we have the same mother. MALE NARRATOR: Before the time of the pyramids a fearsome horde came from the East and swept across the barren lands of the ancient world. (HORSES WHINNYING) (WOMAN SCREAMING) NARRATOR: By the law of the horde their greatest warrior was proclaimed their king. His name was Memnon. He was the greatest swordsman the world had ever seen. With the predictions of a sorcerer who could foretell the outcome of every battle, Memnon slaughtered all who resisted him (PEOPLE SCREAMING) until only a brave few remained. (ALL ARGUING) SHence! My father has called for silence! Hold your tongues! We are gathered in this place to put our differences aside. There is still time for us, the last of the free tribes, to stand together against this tyrant. With his sorcerer at his side, no mortal can defeat Memnon. And if the sorcerer were to die, what then? It's too late for your schemes, Pheron. I have raided Memnon's caravans, broken the supply lines to his troops, but he still swept across the land like a plague. I will not send my people to their deaths in a battle that can't be won. And what people would that be, Balthazar? You are the ruler of nothing but a pile of rocks and sand. If I'm no king, (GROANS) why are you on your knees before me? Balthazar! Guards! Akkadians. I thought they were wiped out long ago. They are the last of their kind. By their hand, the sorcerer will die. You put your faith in a clan of cutthroats who kill for money? They are more than that. They are skilled assassins trained for generations in the deadly arts. And what price do these mercenaries ask from us, Father? Twenty blood rubies. That's the last of our treasury. Be quiet. If these men kill the sorcerer, will you fight? (MURMURING) (ALL SHOUTING) So be it. As long as one of us still breathes the sorcerer will die. Assassin! Him, we'll kill for free. We can reach Memnon's encampment by nightfall. When are you gonna get rid of that filthy beast? He doesn't mean anything by it. Horses are faster. But camels are smarter. (GRUNTS) (WHISTLES SOFTLY) (GRUNTS) That one's mine. Live free. Die well. Stop. Stop. Listen to me. I am a high priest of Set. Spare me, and I shall bless thee in five different languages. You'll scream in five different languages. Horse thief. Wait! Wait! (WHISTLES) (GRUNTS) Hey! I'm not that heavy. ARPID: Look out for the fat one! He's behind you! Help me! Help me! Whoever you are, help me! Oh, thank you. Thank you, good sir. Quiet. Surely you've heard of the enormous reward for my safe return. The sorcerer's tent. Back! (GRUNTS) (ALL YELLING) MAN 1: Make way! MAN 2: Find the other one! You've been betrayed, Mathayus. You know my name? And why you're here. SOLDIER 13 He's in the tent! SOLDIER 2: You! Move around back! (GRUNTING) (BOTH GRUNTING) A living, breathing Akkadian. This is a rare pleasure. I hear you train yourselves to bear great pain. You must teach me this, if you live long enough. Not looking so full of yourself, are you now, assassin? You betrayed your own father? Yes. He was very shocked. You could tell by the look on his face. By my father's head, I pledge my allegiance. MEMNON: You have proven your loyalty, Takmet. This one still lives. Beautiful. Bring him to me. Mathayus. Mathayus. Live free. Die well, my brother. So, how shall this one die? He shall not die tonight. Really? We shall see. Nor shall he die by your hand or any hand you command. You have seen this in a vision? To ignore this would bring great misfortune. The gods show him favor on this night. Just the gods? A puzzle then. How to kill you without using my hand or any hand I command? Fascinating, isn't it? The smoke, it causes the fire ants to abandon their homes, you see? All the sooner to feast on our naked heads. (CHUCKUNG) You think this is funny? It's a little bit funny. Yes. You see, I am about to escape while you are about to die a horrible death for leaving me to die last night. So what are you waiting for? You see that one up there? He's been drinking that yak piss for about an hour now and sometime very soon... You see? (GROANS) Hey! Where's the horse thief? (SCREAMING) (GRUNTS) All right. Come on. Get me outta here. Do you promise not to kill me? Yes, I promise. Remember, you are an Akkadian. You make an oath, you always have to keep it, right? That's right. Promise to take me with you and share in the spoils of your adventures. What? All right. Fine. Yes, I promise. All right. Now hold still. Oh, here's one. That's a big one! My! Here comes the mother. (GRUNTS) So, where are we going? To Memnon's kingdom to avenge my brother's death. Never touch the bow. Not a problem. (WHISTLES) Who are you calling? My ride. It's a nice camel. Not much room back here. Scoot up, please. Hey! We had a deal! That's right. And I haven't killed you yet. What news from my sorceress today? (WOMAN SHRIEKING) What news? Your armies will conquer in the West. Queen lsis's forces will scatter to the four winds. Give the generals the news. Have them make their armies ready for the final campaign. Yes, my lord. (GROWLING) You think I'm cruel, don't you? Perhaps you've forgotten what it's like outside these walls. Heartless, ignorant and savage. But I can change that. I will bring order after centuries of chaos. An order which will last for a thousand years. Rivers of blood can never bring peace. But they can bring obedience. That will suffice for now. And when I have become the king of legend, then you shall take your place beside me on a throne and in my bed. But, my lord, in your bed I would lose my gift of sight and you would lose your advantage in battle. The day I speak of is the day I no longer need your vision. Gomorrah. Let me tell you, after a hard day of looting and pillaging, there is no greater city than Gomorrah. Except maybe Sodom. I wish I could join you. You're not going? Believe me, I'd like to even the score with a few of those Red Guards myself. But with the price I've got on my head, I'd never make it through those gates. I have faith in you, my friend. You'll get us in. You see? They've got the city sealed up tighter than a crab's buttocks. I wish there was something I could do to help, but... Oh, but there is. What business do you have here? I've come to collect a bounty. Horse thief. Oh. I know this dog. They'll behead him for sure this time. He'll be all the prettier without it. What happened? You got us in. I knew you could do it. A jug of your finest wine for my road-weary friend here. Wait a minute. The last thing that... That I remember was this huge Akkadian fist coming straight into... Here's your wine, sir. Please, let me know if there's anything else you'd like. It's good to be back in the big city. Watch my camel for me? Gladly. Been working here long time? How's the kabob? MAN: Merchandise of the highest quality. Virgin steel forged by the monks of Pompeii. Here! Here they are! The world's finest swords. You can't get respect in Gomorrah without a quality blade... Birds of paradise, birds of prey. The most beautiful birds in the world. Hey, soldier. Those big muscles look cramped. Perhaps one of us can help you relax. Maybe all of us. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Mister, mister. Guide, mister. You need a guide to find your way in Gomorrah. A good guide might be able to show me a way into Memnon's palace. But a smart guide wouldn't, or he'd be shown into Memnon's dungeon. I don't have it. Do you wanna earn this one? (MEN LAUGHING) (SHUSHING) Get ready. I'll kill half, you kill half. All right. I'll kill them all. How about we go around them and not kill anybody? Good Lord. Are you going to kill me? Maybe later. Memnon's always threatening to have my head. Don't touch that. What is it? That's my special magic powder. Magic powder? Yeah, magic powder. It's a Chinese formula that I procured at great expense. If I get the recipe right, it'll move mountains, clear roadways in an instant. Do great things, wonderful things. Or terrible things. Like all my inventions, Memnon will try to use it for war. Where is Memnon? Oh, you mean to kill him, do you? Yes. Well, in that case, I'd say he was in the training courtyard. (GRUNTING) (ALL APPLAUDING) (SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) No! Let me go! I didn't do anything! You know the penalty for thievery. No! Oh, no. BOY: No! MAN: Intruder! Follow me! You again. How do I get outta here? Through that door. What's that? That's one of my latest inventions. It was meant to be a means of quick transportation but there was a little problem with the landings. GUARD: Open! Open! Don't touch that. You'll set it off. Right. (SCREAMING) Oh. Oh, my! A man. MATHAYUS: What is this place? Lord Memnon's harem. But he visits so rarely. And it gets so lonely. Can't you leave me alone, Thorak? Watch your tongue, Philos. Careful with those! They're delicate instruments. You're lucky Lord Memnon has a taste for your "science," you old fool. If I find out you had anything to do with this intruder I will send the executioner. We know how to please. Oh, I'm sure you do, ladies, but I... Stay with us. Stay with us. That's nice, but now's not a good time. We will make your every fantasy come true. (WOMEN SCREAMING) Kill him! After him! Go get him! (SCREAMING) Well, are you gonna try to kill me or just stare at me? (GROANS) Take a breath. (SCREAMING) Gods be praised! How dare you touch me! Sorceress, I am an Akkadian hired to kill you. Now, I find myself in a position where you are of more use to me alive. Don't make me change my mind. And he said it's not the size of the hump, it is the motion of the camel. (ALL LAUGHING) (HORNS SOUNDING) (WOMEN SCREAMING) Alas, I must leave you now. There's the traitor! Oh, great gods! ARPID: He is dead! Just admit it, you smelly camel! I am your master now! You belong to me! He's dead! Dead! Dead! You are alive. I knew it! Right. I was just saying to the camel, "Camel, no one could kill our good friend Mathayus." Get on. Why should I make it easy for you? You're sworn to kill me. Others will die first. That's comforting. So who is your friend? Memnon's sorcerer. Memnon's sorcerer? Are you insane? She's going to get us all killed! Memnon will have to leave the safety of his palace to get her. So you're going to use me first and then kill me? I feel so much better. I could always do it the other way around and kill you first. So where are we going? The Valley of the Dead. The Valley of the Dead? Nobody goes to the Valley of the Dead! That's why they call it the Valley of the Dead! Wait for me, please! Take a dozen of your best men, track him down, kill him and bring her back to me. Send me news when he's dead. Yes, my lord. My lord. There are rumors spreading to the armies that she's gone. Is this true? It is, my lord. Then silence them! They must believe she is here, if only for a short time. And when you find the Akkadian, give him this from me. Are we where I think we are? Yes. Home. Where are you going, Sorceress? (GRUNTING) In a hurry to get back to Memnon? No, I'm in a hurry to get away from you. I'll never go back to Memnon. He's kept me prisoner since I was a child. Why did you help me that night in the tent? I knew you were the one man who could help me escape. Run if you like. There are worse dangers out there than me. MATHAYUS: What do you mean you can't find it? I know it's around here somewhere. What are you looking for? Just a little place to get out of the storm. What storm? You'll see. Thorak. Memnon didn't come, did he? Sent his maggots to do his work. He's smarter than you think. Or more cowardly. Can I go home now? Stay here. Cover up. You'll be safe. Look, sir. He's attacking! Alone? The sun has fried his brain. A thousand duranas for the one that brings me his head. (HORSES WHINNYING) Akkadian bastard! Where is he? This way! You two first. Come on. Go. (SCREAMING) (SCREAMING) Stay on the stones. (GASPS) (SCREAMING) Come with me. Don't touch that. (SCREAMS) Coward! Show your face! (BOTH GRUNTING) (COUGHING) The Akkadian. Mathayus! (CAMEL GRUNTING) You are alive! You swatted them like flies! You are invincible! Tell me. Do you think you can save him? His fever's high. The poison was made with scorpion venom. If he does live, the blood of the scorpion will always flow through his veins. (GRUNTS) Sorceress. It's a miracle. She cured you. I knew it! I felt her magic! It almost killed her, but the gods, they were on our side. Why? Why would you risk your life to save mine? Because I believe you can save the people. The people are not my problem. Memnon is. You and the people have the same problem. (BIRD TWITTERING) Pardon, my lord. A message from Thorak. Finally the Akkadian is dead. Is there something wrong, my lord? Not at all. Everything is in order. In fact, things are going so well that I'm moving up our plans. Tomorrow night, we feast to celebrate our impending victory. And then we'll drive the last of the rebels into the sea. Now, go. My lord, it is customary for the sorceress to be present at these meetings. Why is she not here today? She's indisposed. It is nothing serious, I hope. If it were serious, then you would know about it. Now, go! She is alive. She is with him and he's coming here. Get ready. It works! It works! My lady. How lovely to see you out here in this desolate place! Let me show you. it works! Come, come, come! My lady sorceress. You see? I worked it out. My Chinese formula. My magic powder works! All I needed was salt. Petered salt. It was here all the time. This place is just full of it. By the way, do any of you happen to have any water? What do you think? Is it safe to drink? (WHOOPING) Not anymore. Delicious. The sandstone must act as a natural filter. Quiet. I'm alive! I'm alive! For the moment. Mathayus. Move! Assassin. The gods are good to me. When we last met, you offered to kill me. Now I have a chance to return the favor. You're trespassers here. Our survival depends on this place being kept a secret. So we have a problem as long as you're alive. ARPID: No problem. I can keep a secret like no other. In fact, I cannot remember how we got here. We took a left turn... It's too late for that. WOMAN: Balthazar! This place is sanctuary for all of Memnon's enemies. You know that. This man is dangerous. Your judgment is clouded. My judgment keeps all of you alive. This man cannot be trusted, and I'll prove it. Bring the woman to me. The first man to touch her will have to come through me. I had hoped for nothing less. (BOTH YELLING) (ALL CHEERING) (BOTH GRUNTING) (ALL CHEERING) That's not fair. (CLUCKING) Get him. No! Yeah! Do you yield? Never. Then you're a fool. We're brothers in the same cause. Brothers? You brought death to my people. Memnon will follow you. He will come for his sorceress. Yes, I know who she is. And Memnon will stop at nothing till she's returned. He'll come swifter and deadlier once he has her. Memnon will stop at nothing. Hide here as long as you can, but believe me when I say he'll find you. And if he isn't stopped, he'll sweep across this land and kill all of you. (LAUGHING) And who's gonna stop him, Akkadian? You? Will you stand alone before the fury of his armies? Yes. (PEOPLE CHEERING) A gentleman always lets a lady win. You didn't. Best two out of three? Dates? Oh, thank you. (WOMEN SCREAMING) MEMNON: Cassandra! I've had a vision. Memnon will follow me here and destroy these people. You know this? The things I see are like shimmers in a pond. Some are certain, and some remain shadows. But I do know this. Memnon will release his armies and ride straight through this place. Memnon will die by my hand. It seems the gods favor me tonight, Akkadian. (GROANS) If you face Memnon, you'll die. That is your destiny. I make my own destiny. I need your help. ARPID: You can't leave us here. Mathayus, don't be so stubborn. Listen to reason. You can't go alone. You're going to get yourself killed. Where do you think you're going with my horse? To Gomorrah. Nothing we can say will stop him. Without your sorceress? She returned to save the lives of your people. I won't let her face Memnon's wrath alone. Step aside. Akkadian, you're riding to your death. If I let you ride alone, what glory will there be left for me? (DRUMS BEATING) (CROWD CHEERING) So tonight we celebrate. Eat and drink your fill for tomorrow we ride into battle. (ALL CHEERING) I would've captured him myself, but he ran like a coward. He left his bow behind. (WOMEN LAUGHING) My lord. There is something that is troubling our soldiers. How distressing. Pray tell. It's been said the sorceress is no longer by your side. Soldiers will fall prey to idle palace gossip. You have my word, she's perfectly safe. If the men are to fight, to die, they may need more than that. Do you doubt my word? It is not that, sire. It's just she is a symbol from which the men derive courage. Symbols are most effective when seen. SORCERESS: My lord. (CROWD MURMURING) I am here at your request. Pardon my absence. I was not well. But our impending victory has lifted my spirit. Is this sufficient to placate your men? Tell them what you see, Sorceress. I see a great victory. Your enemies will reveal themselves to you. Halt. What is in the cart? "What is in the cart"? Actually, it is a bit of a surprise. A gift for tonight's festivities. Prince Takmet's request. Very nice. Well, now. Let's see that pretty little face. (GROANS) (SCREAMING) Now go to my chambers. We have things to discuss. My sincerest apologies, my lord. I understand. You are fearful, weak. (ALL GASP) The feast is over. To bed, men, for tomorrow we conquer. Fortify the palace guard. (GRUNTING) Whoa. All right. That was the easy part. Everybody know what to do? Cripple the guards. Ignite the powder. And try not to get killed. What are you doing here? You could get hurt. So could you. Stay in the wagon. You watch yourself, Akkadian. No need for concern, miss. Oh, he's gonna pay for that. Hey, hey. Seal the gates. Seal all the gates. Though I'm relieved to see you unharmed, I am somewhat surprised the Akkadian didn't kill you. He was after you. I was merely a pawn. But you escaped his grasp? I'm not without my wiles. Yes, I'm well aware of that. Bring them. Tomorrow my victory is complete. That is your vision? As I said, I have seen it. Have you? I sense a change in you. You seem somehow diminished. I assure you. I am myself. Good. A small demonstration shouldn't trouble you then. A simple test. (SNAKE HISSING) Now go. Everyone leave. Where am I going? Stop. It's over there. Should be just there. Good man. Well, well. What do we have here? (GRUNTS) One at a time. Six urns, four cobras. Now. Let's see what you can see. ExceHenL One empty pot left now. Who dies first? We're almost there. You know what I see? Fear. You have lost your power, thrown it all away. What magic is this? My magic. I see your fate, hollow king. And its time has come. You wish to test magic against steel? I've come for the woman and your head. The assassin and the sorceress, how romantic. I'll bury you both together. And here it is, the foundation stone. Hurry, we're running out of time. I'm hurrying, I'm hurrying. Fire in front, palace guard at your back. Looks like I'll be keeping my head after all, Akkadian. Kill the witch! (YELLING) Mathayus! For your father. (GROANING) Die well, assassin. (GRUNTING) (GROANS) it seems the gods favor me tonight, Akkadian. Mathayus! (GROANS) Hurry up and light it. You hurry up and light it. This is your invention. Follow me. Ready! Weapons! (MATHAYUS GROANING) So much for not getting killed. Catch this. Hail to the king! ALL: Hail, hail! I knew it from the start. Hail! Yeah! Mathayus! (ALL CHEERING) Stay here with us, Balthazar. There's much work to be done. I have to look after my own people. You're a king now, Akkadian, and a good one, I think. Don't forget how you got here or the people you came from. My people will live on through me. Remember, there'll always be a place for you here. Live free. Rule well. Remember, Nubian eyes will be watching you, Scorpion King. I see a time of great peace and prosperity ahead. How is it you see this? Don't the legends say you'll lose your powers if you... Can you think of a better way to keep a king from taking advantage? Well, neither could my ancestors. And how long will this time of peace last? Nothing lasts forever, my king. That is the destiny of all kingdoms. Then we'll make our own destiny. (ALL CHEERING) (I STAND ALONE PLAYING) I've told you this once before You can't control me If you try to take me down you're gonna break And I feel your every nothing that you're doing for me I'm picking you out of me You run away I stand alone inside I stand alone You're always hiding behind your so-called goddess So what you don't think that we can see your face Resurrected back before the final fallen I'll never rest until I can make my own way I'm not afraid of fading I stand alone Feeling your sting down inside me I'm not dying for it I stand alone Everything that I believe is fading I stand alone inside I stand alone And now it's my time Now it's my time It's my time to dream It's my time to dream Dream of the sky Dream of the sky Make me believe that this place is invaded By the poison in me Help me decide if my fire will burn out Before you can breathe Breathe into me I stand alone inside I stand alone Feeling your sting down inside me I'm not dying for it I stand alone Everything that I believe is fading I stand alone inside I stand alone inside I stand alone inside I stand alone inside (ALONG THE WAY PLAYING) I'm dizzy and weary from the heat As the sands erase the hands of time Do a job with you involved This is a betrayal I walk through the valley and stab him to death I see a face I can't seem to forget The war you wage Whatever that happens you pay Something wrong in you Comes alive in your hate Lose yourself in some kind of hell Left you burnin' up where you are now You'll never ever get out No Somewhere along the way Time changes everything This race cannot be won Some days it crawls while other days it flies It feeds on our flaws It knows no compromise
