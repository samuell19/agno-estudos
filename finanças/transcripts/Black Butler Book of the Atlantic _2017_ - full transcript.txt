Subtitles by sunny49 joyee Wah! So this is the Campania ship! Sure is huge. So suprising! Please take these to the first class suite number A66. Campania ship. Majestic Star Line - a bet on the company's service of construction, a super luxurious cruise sailing across the Atlantic ocean. I get excited only by watching. It's so nice! Snake is also going together with them. Take a good care of the young master for us. I have always wanted to travel on a ship. While we are gone, please do your jobs properly. Yes Sir! Well then! We're off! Have a good trip! Be careful! Welcome! All the boarding passengers, please make haste! Goodbye! Be careful! Don't get a sea sickness! Bye bye! Phew! Made it just in time! I'm on the board, all according to the plan, so - Wind in our sails! The future is looking bright! For us, that is. We have started departing. Yeah. What lies ahead... is known only to the great ocean. In other words, you're saying that they are reviving the dead there. That's about right. Unfortunately. I'm not really into an occult - And what if that's not an occult? What? Karnstein hospital. Down at the black docks the Earl has left me in charge of. They seem to be doing a lot of shopping. Drugs? No. People. They come shopping for foreign slaves illegally. The amounts are quite unusual. So there is a possibility that the revival of the dead is occuring as a result of illegal human experimentation? That's right. If that is the truth, we certainly have a problem. Removing the thorns from the rose in advance will prevent hurting your hands in the future. Sebastian, investigate immediately. Please leave it to me. I have returned. That was fast, as always. What's with that outfit? As they say, when in Rome do as the Romans do. Moreover, I have obtained some rather interesting information. What. According to a nurse, Karnstein hospital have opened a secret association called Aurora Society. Their motto is: "The complete salvation for the mankind through medicine.'' They collect donations from nobles, and holds presentations for the results of their experiments regularly. However. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any trace or evidence of the slaves. As expected, We will have to search within the Aurora Society itself. Yes. Just about that. Their next meeting is scheduled on 17th of April, on a passenger ship departing from the Southamphon port. Meeting on a ship. Even for nobles that is - On the 17th of April... I will go on a trip with my family in April. For 3 weeks starting from 17th of April we'll be travelling to New York on a luxurious passenger ship. My father wondered how about asking Ciel to join us. What is the name of the ship? The Majestic Star Line's luxury - "Campania" cruise. Ciel. No way! When I invited you, you said it's not possible. I - I wanted to suprise you. You took a vacation for my sake! I'm so happy. Elizabeth. Please do not display such indecent behaviour in public! Mother is right, Lizzie. Moreover, I still haven't acknowledged you as my brother-in-law. So get off her quickly! Come on, brother! Why are you still saying that! Viscount Midford, I have not seen you in a while. Long time no see, my future son!! You're cute as always. Darling! You're cute as always. Father! You're cute as always. Father! So we can be together for the whole 3 weeks? Yeah. We have never been together for so long before! Escort me to the dinner party, okay Ciel! Okay, okay. What the hell. Isn't it alright. The meeting will be held on the night of 19th. How about taking a good rest occasionally? I have to dress up! Well, it's okay occasionally. Eh, you're on a vacation, really? You guys are - Earl Gray! Earl Phipps! It has been a while, Midford couple. Why are you here? That is our line. This time we were invited to board on this ship as a present from her Majesty. And then meant to find a caring person and fall in love. By the way, I knew it, you weren't dead. I have returned back to life even more healthy. Could it be, that it was necessary for me to get injured by someone. Eh! Well then, you have to be thankful to that ''somebody''. He is the savior of your life. Certainly. I'm praying that this will be a fun experience, for both of us. Ah! Ciel! Look, look! That cake is so cute! I will bring you some too. As expected of the Earl Really, the nobles are - They are gathering everyday, talking about the most irrelevant things. I feel stupid to have abandoned my work to come here. Well then, you won't accept the marchioness invitation to give you an introduction to fencing? Are you not gonna let me see the face of the goddess of the statue of liberty. More importantly, Young Master. It is tonight. Yeah. Would you like one? That is it. The signal for opening the Aurora Society's meeting is a waiter walking around the hall carrying empty glasses. We're following him. Take care of it. Delicious. I'd rather have Ale than any high quality champagne. You also think so, don't you! Well, but you have to have some refined brand name champagne if you drink with your girl! Must be nice! I am so jealous of her! If only I had one. What? You don't have? No way, is that- Even though I don't have a girl, No way, is that- Even though I don't have a girl, I have a lot of time. For our free time - Cheers! It's over there. Please hold on. According to my information, Aurora Society has a fixed greeting. The ones who does not know it, will be made to leave. Say those things sooner! Well. What kind of greeting? That is... Unbelievable. Really? Something like that? If you're unable to do it, we will be exposed as outsiders. And escorted out immediately. Please do not hesitate under any circumstances. Well then, shall we get going. Welcome. The first time, I suppose. Th- The complete flame in our chests... Shall not be extinguisged by anyone. We are... We are... The Phoenix! What's up with this pose! This can't be right! If we are wrong, everything will be ruined, Sebastian. The Pheonix! Welcome to the Aurora Society! These are your membership badges. T- Thank you very much. I won't do it twice. To think that you would do that! Undertaker! Saying ''The Pheonix'' with that serious face. You bastard! Now, now. young master. More importantly, why are you here? Have you forgotten what is my work? The hospital is a regular customer of mine. Regarding to what is happening in here - Do you know anything of it? If you want information, I have to get my compensation. I already made you laugh a plenty! Let's see... How about you do that pose once more? Who will! The Pheonix! Sorry, I arranged to pose in my own style. Is that the Viscount of Druitt? Come to think of it, he had a doctors license, didn't he. He is coming this way. Oh my, are you beginners? Yes, we saw the article in the newspaper. Have I met you before somewhere? No! I'm sure this is our first meeting! Indeed, I surely wouldn't forget such a beautiful boy as yourself. Ah! But what a pitful bandage you have. F-Father! My father said, if I come here it can be cured. Father? Hey, you two! It is starting! He is the founder of our Aurora Society, Ryan Stoker. The complete flame in our chests... shall not be extinguished by anyone. We are the Pheonix! The Pheonix! Everyone, thank you for coming to Aurora Society's "Complete salvation for mankind through medicine''. What is a complete salvation? That is a complete health! A healthy body, healthy teeth, healthy spirit, a healthy mood! Healthyness is truely splendid! However, there is the worst kind of health issue, that we cannot overvome, no matter how hard we try. What is it? Death. And the great power that will save us from this disaster... It is the Aurora Society's medicine! From now on, we will present the fruits of our ''Complete salvation through medicine'' project. Margaret Connor. Aged 17 years. Lost her life at an early age due to an unfortunate accidient. It is truly pitful. This death has scarred her families hearts and ruined even their health. I want to save them completely. I want to save them completely. Is the corpse real? I want to save them completely. Is the corpse real? Most likely. Is the corpse real? Most likely. The smell of death is so strong, it makes my nose to twitch. Well then everyone, please take a look at this. The power of the medicine. A complete salvation! Oh, it's about time. Where are you going? There is a job I must do. Eh? Already? Well then, would you like to meet tomorrow here as well? OK. If we meet alive, that is. What do you mean! Come! Rise from the death! Just like the Pheonix! Take a look! Maggy. With our medicine, we can even overcome death! Maggy. With our medicine, we can even overcome death! Unbelievable! Doctor, thank you very much! That is the complete salvation! What is going on! Did he really revive a corpse? Margaret As long as you are alive, your mother is, your mother is... Wait Maggy! Sebastian! Yes, my lord. Did you get her? Please step back. What on earth is going on! I'm sure I stabbed her in the heart. It is a being that I do not understand. Shit! It failed! Why are you standing about! Take her down, already! You useless! Wait! Young master! How the hell are we supposed to take care of that? Firstly, dismember it so that it cannot move. These guys cannot be killed unless you smash their heads. Like this. You are... Ah, really, I knew she was dead. That's why I told them, I collected her properly. Totally unbelievable. Who are you. You should know them well, young master. This one has it alright. Investigation complete. A Shinigami? Ah, that getup... Could it be, you're the rumoured ''Sebas-chan''? The Shinigami Dispatch Association, Collection division: Ronald Knox. Thanks for taking care of my sempai! You just said, that they cannot be killed unless their heads are smashed, but - Do you Shinigami know something about regarding this? Nope, we don't know any details either. Just, we had reports of corpses, who's souls had surely been collected moving around. So I came to investigate. This thing here really is genuinely a corpse. Because I definitely got her soul 2 weeks ago. So it looks like we have to make Ryan to spit it out. Let's go! If the administration gets a wind of a demon being on the board, it will turn out very troublesome. And I'll totally pass on any overtime. So won't you just vanish? I will go on ahead. After you've done playing, hurry up and follow me! Understood. So nasty. Kids nowadays feeling to it. Should you really be looking the other way? Huh! As expected from a death scythe. It's impeccably sharp, isn't it. Pretty much. The cargo area. Lizzy! Jeez! Are you going to shoot your fiancée! More importantly, why are you here? Why? Even though I told you to wait, you just disappeared! So that's why I was looking for you, and saw you running. Ciel! Oh no! Such a dark place, it's so unpleasant. Who is there? Snake... Did you notice only now? Says Wordsworth. What are you doing in a place like this? The cooking was so delicious, so I thought I'd share it with everyone. Says Dan. Well then. By the way the cake was really tasty! It's the cake with strawberries that you like so much. I wanted you to eat it! Here! Huh. This isn't the same one from before! There were more? Leave it to me! Says Wilde. That's the mark of Aurora Society! Ryan brought another revived corpse? Snake, I will do something about it. Take care of Lizzy. Snake! Hey, listen to what - If it's the bird mark, there's a lot more of it over there. Says Oscar. Don't tell me. Could all those be - You're just as good as rumoured. Well, thank you. Whoops, it's almost time. Well, thank you. Whoops, it's almost time. I didn't have time to play around. No way that I'm going to write an apology for being late. One should know how to do their job. So anyway! See ya! Sebas-chan! Run Lizzy! Ciel! Smile! Quickly, climb up here! Says Oscar. What are those? Aside from the poision not affecting them, they have a horrible smell. Says Webster. I don't know the details, but for some reason these corpses began moving about. C-Corpses? Snake, the snakes. It is going to be impossible with this amount. Says Oscar. C-Ciel! It's okay! I'll definitely protect you at least! No matter what happens! How admirable, young master. That's how an english gentleman is supposed to be. Sebastian! Don't stand about! Clean them up already! Understood. It's not very stylish But if just destroying their heads is enough... Then I guess this is the fastest way. Splatering crimson. A dancing black. This is... The same scene as that day. I'm done, young master. What's wrong? Come. Please come over. Don't touch me with those hands. They're filthy. I'm very sorry. Couldn't you have done it a little more elegantly? Just like a beast. My apologies, it was an emergency. Also Their bodies seem to be much softer than a normal human beings. But why are there so many on this ship? That is... Something that should be asked to him. Ryan Stoker! It's wrong! It was an incomplete complete salvation- I didn't plan on reviving them in this unhealthy state. Besides for them to eat other - Ack. No need to be hasty. There is a plenty of time until we reach New York, so we'll listen to your story leisurely. Wait a second! What is it? I already cleaned them up, so - It's not that! Huh? This ship has the latest gigantic boiler with a steam engine, which is installed in the center. This place is divided in two sections, and the boiler separates them. What's about it? In other words. There is another cargo room on this ship. And over there we have stored ten times as much samples as in here. Ten times? Hey. What's the matter? It's a warning signal from the ship preceding us. What? This is bad! Go and tell the captain! Understood! Dammit. Well then, basically this ship is - Most likely infested by a horde of them at this time. No way! Sebastian. Go ahead and take my aunt and the others to a safe place. And young master? We'd just be a burden. I have a gun. We will be fine for a while. Come back as soon, as you have ensured that they are safe. Understood. Well then. How about telling us everything? First of all, how should we deal with them? There is no way you decided to transport something so dangerous, without any kind of insurance. Isn't there another way to stop them, besides smashing in their heads? Well, there is one. In my room, There is a device that allows you to render patients subjected to complete salvation again. Lead me there. What. Are you injured? Butler! What are they? I don't know any details, but there is only a one way to defeat them. Destroying their head. Apparently what you said is true. In consideration of the advice, this time I will excuse your slovenly face and hairstyle. Thank you very much. Ah butler. What happened to Lizzy? She is with the young master. They are both safe. If they are together, we have nothing to worry about. Yes, that boy is going to protect his fiancee at all costs. Indeed, at all costs. I was ordered by the two of them to escort you to a - We cannot do that! I was ordered by the two of them to escort you to a - We cannot do that! The members of Midford household have protected england for generations. As knights we never abandon people in danger. We are english knights. We are the shield that protects the weak. Right? Frances! Mother! Yes. Go back to where they are right away. But... Don't you trust our ability as a swordsmen? I understand. Please be safe. Lets go! Tell this to Ciel! If something happens to my sister, he won't be forgiven. Certainly. See, I did say we might not meet alive. Since you're on the list. I'm sick and tired of this, seriously. I'm so busy already. And the worst has yet to come. So cold. Hey, aren't they a bit too loud downstairs? I bet it's just the usual drunktards making - Huh？ Why no one is answering? At this rate! I swear, we've got a super overtime course here. Overtime is really not my thing. The guys in the management is asking for the impossible. How can we collect so many souls. When there's only two of us. You shouldn't be that rude on a maidens first night. If you ram such a big thing into her... She will break. A broken, bloodstained maiden trip. It's now unstoppable. You can't go back! It's too late to turn around! This is like a ... Big guilt trip of ... DEATH. What is this shaking? Could it be? Did we crush into that? Water tight doors. Now it will hold the flooding for a while. But to think that all of the crew has been wiped out. Seems like tonight will be the worst. Huh? Hey don't look the other way! Come on! Why don't you try feeling it? This salty breeze! Almost as if my whole body is being - Carresed! Umm, Sutcliff sempai. Carresed! Umm, Sutcliff sempai. Are you trying to torment your new subordinate? I'd rather do it with a more handsome guy than a brat like you! I just can't get excited at all with you as my partner. I give up, give up. Anyway, we really shouldn't be doing something like this. Take a look at this list! We have only 1034 collections left! For us the soul collecting is absolute. Let's get over with it. Ah, it finally stopped. What was that shock just now? This alarm means... The water tight doors are shutting! Hurry!! Lizzy! Ciel! It's too late, boy! Lizzy! Ciel! Ciel! Why! I promised, I'd protect you at all costs. Snake, you guys go ahead. I can't leave you behind! Says Emily. Don't worry! We will escape through the duct. Your friends cannot be soaked in a cold water for too long. Go! Smile Keats will guide you through the duct! We'll meet up later! Says Emily. Yeah - I'll definitely see you later! Lizzy, first off with those clothes. N-No! Don't be stubborn! You can't wade through this with that kind of skirt. No way! I want you to think of me as cute until the end! If you die, you won't ever be able to wear the clothes you love! It's all over when you die! All of it! I'm sorry. I'll ask Nina to make a new dress for you. A much nicer one than you're wearing today. So... No, Ciel! I'm sorry for being stubborn. I'm also sorry for being so rough. Well then, let's go! This way youngster, quickly! What happened to him? Says Oscar. You jerk! Hey stop it! Says Oscar. At a quick glance, the ship seems to have taken damage over quite an extensive area. In this state 3... No, at least 4 divisions should have flooded already. Which means - One after another, there is no end to it! Can't we just quit this already? Because this ship will sink - within one hour. The water should be about two degrees. To be soaked in it for a long time will harm the body. That means - I must hurry to their side. L-Look, I'll give you this check... When you return to land you can have a good life! Hurry up! Let's go lower the lifeboats! But if those things are outside... What was that just now? We're doomed. Don't give up!!! Made of the first rate swordsmanship - The first rate butlers! But this has really turned out beyond any expectations. However, at this rate if all of the passengers would be fated to die, Her Majesty would be deeply saddened. We will hold this! Anyone who isn't injured, go help lower the lifeboats! Hurry! Yes! By the way, they are monsters. Are you alright, Gray? If they can be cut with a sword, they do not frighten me. Very well! Forward! To the Queen! Ciel! It ... doesn't hurt. Sebastian! Please excuse my lateness. Are you two injured? Ciel protected me, so I'm fine! What about my aunt and the others? They are unharmed. Thank you, Sebastian! Well then, the lifeboats are being prepared as we speak. Let's hurry to the deck - Hottie. Found you. You are... Grell Sutcliff! Hi! Sebas-chan! It must be fate for us to meet again here! It's a coincidence. Ah! So cold! That side of you is lovely as always. Ah man, he found him... You never change, don't you, Sebas-chan! Sempai, please do not forget about the souls. You never change, don't you, Sebas-chan! Sempai, please do not forget about the souls. RONALD! Tell me sooner if Sebas-chan is around! I would have put more effort into my make-up - Ah! Wait up there! We need to hurry on, so could you please open the way? And if I say no? I'll have to use force. That's fine. I don't mind getting a little aggressive. Well then let's have a death match that's even hotter than a love romance! Who is he? Just a pervert. I'm afraid it might be contagious, so please step back and stay away from him! That's rude! I'm just honest about my feelings! No! Let's go! Young master! Forgot about me, didn't you? Lizzy... Lizzy! My leg! Lizzy! Run! The bullets! I - I wanted you to think of me as cute ... until the end. Lizzy! This ... This uncute appearence. I didn't want you of all people to see me in such a state. But! This time I will protect you! I am the daughter of the leader of the british knights, Marquis Alexis Leon Midford: Elizabeth! The wife of the Queen's watchdog! What are girls made of? Sugar, spice and everything nice. They are made of this and that. Poetry over philosophy. Embroidery over cooking. Dancing over chess. Be an innocent angel. All the girls from the rose state are raised like that. But I was different from other girls in one way. Gray. Is that the Marques Midford's son, the one rumoured to be a genius with the sword? Huh! What are you saying Phipps? Not here. Valid!! The genius is the daughter. I wasn't dancing waltz in those halls. But one day Ciel said - We'll leave it at that for today. Ciel, are you okay? Such a strong woman is scary... I'm glad that you're the one who's going to be my wife, Lizzy. My cute fiancee, one year younger than me. At that time I decided ... I would become a wife that he could protect. But that day. That incident happened. And that dream was never to be fulfilled. But - But Ciel came back home! Along with a pitch-black butler. The Ciel that had returned to us had become thinner and shorter than I was. But soon I realized that ... It wasn't Ciel who had become shorter, it was me who had grown taller. At that point in time, I made a decision. That I would become a wife capable of protecting Ciel. All the girls of my age are wearing cute high-heels. For Ciel, who is trying hard to be seen as an adult ... I will smile and walk beside him in my childish low-heeled shoes. Low heeled shoes, mother's teachings, a sword to protect you. Those are ... the ''nice things'' that my current self is made of. I'm dripping. Huh? I'm fine with not being cute, as long as it means that I can protect you!! My lady. No further. Sebastian... To have forced a lady to go through so much trouble ... I have failed as a butler. I am deeply sorry. I'll take it from here. I guess my entrance was ruined... Well whatever. Let's continue. Smile! Black! Snake! What happened to Ryan? Sorry, he ran away. Says Oscar. Sebastian! There is no time to waste on someone like him. Ryan holds the key to everything in this case. After him! What? Ryan... Wait a second. You mean that if we put the screws on that guy, we can learn about these walking-corpses? Sempai, look. Hmm? I see. Indeed we have no time to waste. Actually, we were instructed to investigate the truth about the moving-corpses. It's too bad, but we'll have to leave it at this, Sebas-Chan. I'll wrap you in the red of roses next time for sure. Bye bye! We should hurry as - ugh. Oh no! I will carry you on my back! Lady Elizabeth, I'll take care of that... That's right. Yes. Oh no, I ... I am the kind of scary girl that Ciel hates!! Huh? What do you mean by that? You said you don't want a strong wife, didn't you! T-That was in the past. And anyway, I should be the one apologising right now. Then, you will take me as your wife? You wont hate me? I could never ... W-We don't have time for this! Let's go upstairs already!! Ahh so amusing... Even the young master can't help himself in front of a lady, huh? Shut up! Be quiet! Well then shall we get going! You bastard stop laughing. Out of the way! Woman and children first!! You dare call yourselves english gentlemen!? Brother! I'm glad you're okay! Edward, I have a favour to ask. Instead of me, let this guy on. I can't get on the boat just yet. What are you saying! No! It's dangerous! Says Oscar. If Ciel's staying I'm also ... Butler! It would take too much time to make lady Elizabeth understand... Please take care of Lizzy. I understand. Leave it to me. Let's go Sebastian. Yes. You don't have to come back. I'll be fine not having to give you my little sister as a bride. I'll be sure to make it back then. Dammit. It's tilted a lot already. Where in the world are... My, quite a handsome one, aren't you. Got you! Would it be okay to make you into a corpse and let you walk? They're troubling, aren't they. The irregular guys. Death is a rule that you cannot take back no matter what. And - How to stop those things? In... In my room there's a device that can render the complete salvation ineffective! Don't let the light die out! We never know when those monsters are going to attack again! We got a message from a freighter sailing nearby. They should be able to get here in about 2 hours. I see! The only thing we can do is get as many people as possible in the lifeboats. So - Where is the device? No way! It was definitely here... Could it be that... that man! Ah, you're - The Viscount of Druitt...?! Hm? You two, have we met somewhere? More importantly, could it be, that this is the device to stop those corpses? If you want to know, you shall accompany me. To view the new sunrise - The new ''Aurora-thanks to medicine.'' Fine? Should I try to steal it from him by force? No, we don't know how to use it. Let's wait for him to activate it... U-Undertaker! Hi! What are you doing here? While I was escaping I was asked to help carry this. By the way, do you happen to know how to activate this? Who knows - How will this thing be of any help, I wonder. Please be careful, that's worth more than your lives. Are you going to activate it? Not yet. We don't have enough cast. The cast? Bastard! Why did you take the device!? Welcome Ryan. I was waiting for you. Today the Empire you built will collapse like Pompeii! And in it's place, my new realm will be born! With the power of this device ... I will create a new Empire!! Huh! The one who conquered eternity, shall rule over everyone else with corruption and decadence! It will be called... The Aurora Empire! Sounds kind of complex. I'll paint him red right away. You don't care what happens to this device? Huh! Who the hell are you- Wait a sec, Sempai!! Huh! Who the hell are you- This is the real ''power''. I can win against you all with one glass of wine!! Would it be alright to kill him? No, wait. Though I understand your feelings. Wait... there are too many!! Please activate it, Viscount!! No! I am not a viscount anymore. "Caesar". I will activate it if you call me that way. Yeah, let's kill him right now. Please wait, although I understand your feelings. Excuse me! How many paladins putting their fleeting lives at stake... This place is like a coloseuim of corruption. And I'm watching them from above, slowly enjoying my wine. Just like the Emperor Nero! Oh, do we kill him!? You just stopped me earlier! Hey you, make that thing work already! Fine. It's time to found my new Empire. Come on, everybody. Show me the dance of the Pheonix to pledge your loyalty to the Emperor! Let's kill him. Oh no, Are you sure you don't want to know how that device works? What are you doing? Come on!! The... The complete flame in our chests... Shall not be extinguished by anyone ... We are the new incarnation of ... The Pheonix! Well done, gentlemen. Now I will show you! How the dead army prostrates itself before me!! Huh. What is going on! Ryan the device you built isn't working! No way! So it wasn't you who built it? How could I build something like this? Bastard! So you fooled me!? What a useless farce. That's amazing! Wait sempai!! We mustn't kill people! It's been a while since I've laughed so much... To lose such an amusing man would be like losing the whole world to me. Don't you agree? Shinigami? Young master! Ah, how sad would it be, should the laughter disappear. Undertaker! You've been hiding yourself well. Since you kept your eyes hidden, I never noticed either. Me too. I fell for it. Sempai those eyes! Yes. There's no mistaking that yellowish-green glimmer. A shinigami. How nostalgic. It's been half century since someone last called me that. Undertaker is Shinigami? What is the meaning of this, Undertaker? Didn't you tell me that we could control the corpses as long as we have this device? Is that so? Did you fool me? But you see, I thought it was funny, since you were trying to bring the dead back to life in all seriousness. Then - So our goal of making the entire world healthy was...!? But the moment you relied on my skills, that can't be called medicine anymore. The kind of guy who would use a treatment he doesn't even understand on his patients, is no longer a doctor. No way. You were a good boy who honestly believed in my story. In other words. You're the mastermind behind the human resurrection experiments... Undertaker! That's a secret. Is what I'd like to say, But by doing that Phoenix pose you've paid me for an awful amount of information. So I'll tell you. It's true, that I was the one who made these moving corpses. Why? Let's see... At first it was probably just my curiosity towards humans. Humans are "a flesh body" and ''a soul'' If you bring those two together, one can exist amongst the living and keep on documenting their life's memories in the ''cinematic record''. And when the flesh body withers, and the shinigami collect their souls, the record ends there and the living become the dead. Shinigami take the soul from the body according to a list, causing an end to the record. Day by day. Indifferently. Peacefully. When I had lived that shinigami life for a long time, one day I thought... What would happen if the ending had a continuation? What would happen to the flesh body without a soul, if you were to connect a continuation to the memories that had come to an end? No way. You edited the records? Well then, How about you take a look at their records with your own abilities? Wha- What is this!? This is!! What's happening!? The end mark of the cinematic record that comes along wiht every death. By connecting these fake records to them, I made it so that end would never come. And if you do that ... Somehow the body mistakenly thinks that life is still continuing, and starts moving again without a soul! And they who have awakened instincively seek what they lack ... In order to find a ''soul'', They will try and open up the bodies of the living. To settle the balance of the never-ending cinematic record. So they moved by sensing our souls! It's impossible to make another's soul theirs though... A flesh dolls without a self. Not living and not dead ''Bizarre dolls''. This beautifully stitched skin as white as wax, just like they were alive. Their mouths that cannot clamour noisily or tell lies any longer. Aren't they far more beautiful than when they were alive? It makes me sick! That you can't understand this beauty just means you're still too young earl. There're humans who want these bizarre dolls too, you know? They don't feel pain or fear. They eat the living, craving their souls. What do you think? It's the best animal weapon there is, right? That eccentric bunch said they wanted to see till what extent they could use them. By throwing the same amount of humans and bizzare dolls on a luxury cruise ship, it was a decided experiment. Let them kill each other and see how many survive on each end? Quite deranged. But I never thought we'd crash into an iceberg. Having quit being a shinigami, I don't own the list anymore. Well. Considering that it saved me the trouble of making it sink, it's like catching two birds with one stone. It sounds like something that cannot be overlooked. Agreed. Shinigami disorting the way of ''death'' is totally impossible. Though he doesn't have glasses. Is he one of those ''deserters'' you see sometimes? He can be anything for all I care. It's against the rules for shinigami to come to the human world and meddle with life and death matters. You're one to say sempai! Also The crime of hurting a maiden's face! No matter how hot you might be, I can't forgive you for that! I'll take your ba - Sebas-chan, what are you planning. I'd be in trouble if I let you guys haul him off. Huh!? We also have a duty to present the truth before the Queen. We can't let him get away! This is a problem between shinigami! Stay away, outsiders! I also have my job as a butler. So please stay away, outsiders. My my. As fascinatingly stoic as always, Sebas-chan. Fine. If you're going to be like that, we won't hold back either. The fact that something like ''hold back'' exists in your dictionary surprises me more than anything today. Okay, we'll keep it simple and have the fastest be the winner. But I don't intend to lose against some old geezer!! It's almost like a rabbit hunt. Well then... I wonder which rabbit is being hunted? Oops, I made a mistake. Your eyesight seems to be very poor. Shinigami are all heavily near-sighted, you see. Then you're at a disadvantage, aren't you! I cut it? Then why couldn't I last time? My glasses! You seem to be relying on your eyes. Still green- Are you sure you'll be able to take me down with that small tableware? It's not as good as a death-scythe but, our silverware has top grade sharpness! I see~ Hey hey, what's up? The three of you really can't do any better than this? Weren't you going to hunt me down? This is getting so annoying. The ship's tilting badly. We're out of time. I don't care how it looks! We can only go for a head-on fight!! Again! Impossible. There should be nothing a death-scythe can't cut. How can it take it on? The death-scythe can cut everything, huh. Don't you think that catchphrase is a little strange? There is one thing, isn't there? That it can't cut. No way. Ugh- That's - A death-scythe!! I see. The ''it can cut anything'' catchphrase is false when multiple death-scythes are involved. They should've collected it when you retired... It was with me for such a long time, that it became hard to part with. I went through quite some trouble to take it with me, you know... Well then, how about I hunt you now? Like the pitful rabbit in hunting game. It's no use. Cutting a table takes no more effort than breaking a cookie. I just wanted to get within the wide reach of this scythe. You think some really interesting things. Then. So will I. I can finally put you in one of my specially-made coffins. Earl. I knew you'd come! They may be weak and fragile, but a human life is quite hard to drag out. Butler. I always wondered... Why a vicious beast like you would dress up and play the butler? Show me, your record. Sebastian! Ahh, he's calling me. In the midst of sadness and anger, confusion and despair. The cursed words are spat out. Summoning me. What's your name? My name is... Ciel. Ciel Phantomhive. The one who will inherit the house of Earl Phantomhive. I see. That'll be fine. Then I should take a form suitable of being in service to an Earl. Well then. Give me any order. My little lord. He made three requests. That I protect him without betraying until he obtains his revenge. That I obey his orders unconditionally. And that I never lie. They're all quite difficult to accomplish, when you're playing the role of an elegant butler. Someone out there tried to obliterate the phantomhive household. My predecessor lost the game. However. I won't lose. As the head of the Phantomhive household - Ciel Phantomhive, I swear I won't. What's so funny? Well. You told me not to lie, yet you seem to be quite a liar. This looks like a hassle. However, even if it takes as long as all of this boy's life, It still feels like an instant to me. If I can kill time and get a good meal out of it, that's fine by me. Well then, master. Let's go back to the mansion. I don't know where it is. Eh? I have a relative at the royal hospital. Let's go there first and ask. Certainly. Oh my, I ended up serving a boy that was kept in cotton wool. Wait, demon. What's your name? Whatever my master wishes. Then. Sebastian. From today on your name will be Sebastian. Certainly. Well then, from now on please call me Sebastian. Is that the name of your former butler? No... It was my dog's name. I take that back. I ended up serving an incredibly disagreeable boy. This is quite horrible. Young master! Father! Mother! This was the first and the last time, that I heard him call his parents that way. Young master! The sun is setting. The night wind is not good for your health. There are pubs and inns offering lodging in this area, we can - No, that will not be needed. No way! Didn't I promise you? I don't tell lies. This - Something like this is- How could I be the butler of an Earl, if I couldn't even do this? Come! Starting from today this is your manor. Welcome back. My master. Hot! You can't just pour all the boiling water in at once! Check the temperature!! I am sorry. I'll be more careful next time. Well then, I'll wash your body. Ouch, ouch, ouch. That's it! Don't touch me! I'm getting out! What are you saying? You're still dirty. I can't risk having you die suddenly because your wounds- Get out! Certainly. That brat. What's the matter!? I just slipped when I was reaching for the towel. You must be tired after all that happened today... I'll wash you. I said you don't have to. You're being a little too stubborn. Humans are weak animals. They can easily die just from bacteria entering from the smallest of wounds. You're a child that cannot even treat his own injuties properly, don't waste my time. Humans are low beings that will get hungry under any circumstances. Shut your mouth. Well then. Please help yourself! Sebastian Don't ever do such a thing again. Why? If someone sees you they'll get suspicious. Do you want me to do everything one by one like a human? How troublesome. You're my butler! Do what I ask. Certainly. Oh, didn't it please you? It's greasy, spicy and salty. I see. I guess this menu is a little too heavy for you, since you've been in that place all this time. I'll make some risotto- Enough. I'm going to sleep. Please excuse me. What? I brought some hot milk. You should eat something. I don't need it! It probably tastes awful anyway. I only warmed the milk, I didn't add anything to it. I cannot tell if it tastes good or not. Will you try it? What about honey? You can put as much as you want. Grandpa used to tell me that it's bad for teeth before going to sleep. Well then, from tomorrow I shall do the same. Sebastian. The hot milk was tasty. I'm glad to hear that. Also... If tomorrow's breakfast is as bad as today's food I won't forgive you. I'm not going to live on hot milk like a puppy for the rest of my life. So in the end you messed up today's breakfast too. I'm very sorry. My sense of taste is different to humans. Anyway, we have a lot to do today. There are too many things that I don't know about this household. Not only that. As the head of the house you will have to attain a wisdom and education that rivals that of adults. I will perfom the role of the teacher. You? I haven't lived this long for nothing. But I'm pretty strict. That'll be fine. Earl and butler - we're still fake. We have to become real thing as soon as possible. Certainly. Another mistranslation. Did you forget that you made the same mistake yesterday already? Okay. Hands open. Start over. Today's tea is Darjeeling. Sebastian, open your hands. This isn't tea, this is just colored water. Start over. Your stance is off. You have to stand more firmly. If you keep going like this you can only dream of hunting on horse back. The fork is cloudy. You mean to have your master eat dinner with dirty silverware? Start over. If you flinch you lose when dealing with animals. Well then, face forward once again. You're loud Sebastian! I'm very sorry. There are many intruders, so it's taking some time. If you ruin my sleep another night, I won't go easy on you! But he would wake up every night, regardless of the racket. Young master, are you okay? Who? It's Sebastian. It's your butler. Sebastian... Did you have a bad dream again? They're all dead, they're glaring at me. There's no one in the mansion but you and me. No one else. Nothing happened today? Yes. It's a quiet night. Come, lay down - Don't touch me!! Don't touch me ... Do not touch me. Then I'll retire, but if you need anything - Stay. Stay there. Until I fall asleep. Yes. My lord. Excellent! A full score! Not bad. Splendid! Guests should enter properly, through the front door. Also When the young master is awake. This is... Welcome home, Earl Phantomhive. We warmly welcome your return. You shoud've gone and watched up closer. You're as good as family to Ciel by now. It would be presumptuous to call myself something like family. I'm just one hell of a butler. Now you're officially an Earl. The status, the fortune, a beautiful fiancee. They're all yours now. How about it? Would you throw away such foolishness as revenge, and live on in happiness like this? That doesn't sound bad. But! I didn't return to attain happiness. I came back to fight. After taking up this title, Earl Ciel Phantomhive - There's no other way to go but forward. I'll stake on this evil name of mine that I will definitely attain my revenge! He turns his back towards the light without hesitation. That figure that charges into the abyss at a dignified pace. How beautiful and foolish solitude. It's an order Sebastian. You will be my sword and shield. And bring me victory! Yes. My lord. I will definitely deliver you the crown of victory. When you obtain the crown riddled with despair... Your soul will surely be ... extremely delicious. Sebastian! I was sure if it's you, you'd be able to protect the Earl. As expected of you butler. Sebastian. Hey. Sebastian - Ugh. You're loud... I can hear you just fine. Your record was pretty interesting. But it seems like you only make the Earl miserable, after all. So maybe I'll just have you disappear. Crap! Could it already be!? My, my. Oh no! Ryan! Ryan Stoker. 1854. 08. 24. - 1889. 04. 20. Dies in an accident. Nothing to note. Sebby, as you see, there's really no time. I'm sorry but I'll be taking him. You just stay there and watch. I won't- Sempai, I'll leave that to you. I'll finish off the weakened one over here. I can't have you looking down on my butler. Weakened by this? That joke isn't even funny. Right, Sebastian? Yes, very much so. Oh man. It's like I'm picking on the weak here. Huh!? What did you say about picking on the weak? I thought I have seen you somewhere. You were the shinigami playing Madam Red's butler. You also tamper with human lives, don't you? No one likes nosy guys, you now! Isn't the time almost up for you guys? With all these handsome men in front of me, I'm not gonna leave like cinderella. Ronald! Younguns these days are really so feeble. So what's left is ... Young master! L-Look! The ship is!! Well then, it's finally time to say goodbye. It was pretty interesting. Earl. I'll entrust that to you for a while. Please take a good care of it. It's my treasure. Wait, Undertaker!! See you, Earl! Let's meet again. The ship is! Take a deep breath! The the situation being as it is, please forgive me! I went and borrowed this from the sinking ship. Please wear this. I'm sorry I can't prepare any hot tea for you. There might be more people around here! It is impossible to go back with this boat. Behind you! Sebastian! They can move in the water?! They don't need to breathe, so I guess they can't drown either. This is! Sebastian, get in! How many of them are there? I cannot tell. They will probably keep going after souls until their body rots away ... Which also means that you are probably the only living human around here. Well then, we can't escape. If we do, Lizzy and the rest will be targeted. We can't expose the survivors to danger. Whatever it's good or bad thing ... They only seem interested in the soul nearest to them! We'll stop them right here. Can you do it Sebastian? There is no need to ask a servant anything. Please give me an order. This is an order, Sebastian! Clean them up! Yes. My lord. It's going to get a little shakey. So hold on to the boat! How interesting. Humans will drag others down in order to get what they want even in death. What truly insatiable creatures!! Those voices are? What on earth is happening? There might be survivors! Turn the boat around! But - It's too dangerous to move carelessly in this darkness. And what if those monsters are still there. I'm scared! Smile... Sebastian! A death-scythe blow is quite tough even on someone like me. Undertaker... What is his goal? I cannot comprehend but - As long as you hold those funeral lockets, I am sure we will meet him again one day. He did not seem to want to cause you any harm. I've never seen you like this before. I am deeply sorry for my unseemly state. I have failed as the phantomhive family butler. It's the rescue ship. Sebastian... I can't have the phantomhive butler staying like this. Take a good rest once we get back to the manor. You did well today. Young master! Please stop. For you to say such a thing. I don't wish to see a storm after all this. Honestly. Not even able to make collections properly. Did you slack off too much during your suspension? To be transfered from another department. Try putting yourself in my shoes. I can't finish up in time again today. Wake up! Grell Sutcliff! Ronald Knox! Will!! You came to get me didn't you!! This is not a pick up. I came to clean up after a certain piece of trash dispatch member who can't even manage their own job. Hurry up and start collecting. That gaze colder than the sea, ignoring any kind of human rights! It sets my body ablaze! Real lively aren't you, sempai? It sets my body ablaze! Real lively aren't you, sempai? I have been waiting for you, Will!~ Hey! Will! Hey are you listening? Hey lift me ~ Ciel!! Ciel!! Ouch, ouch. Lizzy! I'm so glad! Ciel!! Ciel!!
