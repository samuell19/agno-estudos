'...to study in her uncle's place in the neighboring village' 'The Tiger' 'Few years later' Load those fruits too Let's go It's getting late Chief, demons have entered our village Call Marudheera He's the only one who can oppose the demons Leave me Let go of me Sir...sir Please forgive us We are worlds apart You are a Vethal We are a bottomless hole! You'll be large-hearted enough to forgive us this one time I hope Next time we'll queue up And pay our taxes promptly Marudheera, our tax that's due Marudheera is the only reason... ...you escape every time holding on to my legs forcefully If you delay payment the next time... ...you'll all be entombed! Bro, what's your name? Pidari 'This is our brother Pidari' 'He hacks with his hatchet happily' Our brother- Sing your praises Long live...long live...! 'Pidari is our brother clever He chops people with his cleaver' Long live! Long live!! 'This is our brother Pidari He slashes with his sickle sturdily' Long live 'This is our brother Pidari He kills with his club constantly' Pidari is our brother cleve- He pardoned us and left long ago Oh! Has he gone? Marudheera...! Looks like the entire village is awestruck by your act To crouch now is to pounce later You held his leg today Tomorrow you'll hold him by the scruff of his neck That is time's decree Remember that Your blessings, sir Need a small favor Whoever visits our town... ...you bring them home safe and sound Tomorrow is 'Uthira pooja' My daughter Pavalamalli is finishing her studies on this auspicious day And she's coming back home Tomorrow can you go in the morning... ...to the riverbank and bring her? This is also- This is also- He's trying to say this is also his duty Isn't that so? Marudheera, will Pavalamalli be dusky, dark or fair? She'll be green complexioned How do I find Pavalamalli? 'Can't find my Tharagamangala' 'Neither on land nor in the water' 'She will jump down from the sky maybe' My dearest? 'She has landed' 'Who is this work of art layered with make up?' I'm your cousin Tharagamangala You're not an ordinary star You're a pure white lotus -My mother told me -What did she say? That you sport a dual moustache Who else in this whole world will be so daringly different? From the moment I set eyes on you... ...I have fallen flat He has become as bald as a coot Hey! Scoot Angamuthu...? I'll be right back How is your business? Marudheera, I'm so happy... ...you're riding us home He is 'guiding' us sounds better! Marudheera, you've grown beyond recognition, moustache and all now You don't sport a moustache But does that mean you haven't changed? You look like 'poetry in motion' I must say, you look like a chiselled work of art Your sari drapes that layer You're turning me into a slayer Alright Forget it So what else is happening? Very eventful indeed Even yesterday Marudheera fell at the demon's feet Pleaded and saved our village from a fate worse than death You fell at his feet to save our village? 'Blabbermouth!' I'm ashamed to say I belong to Vairanallur Kodangi...? All this cannot be understood Why not? Doesn't our village boast of daredevil men at all? Marudheera, turn the carriage to the left We can all escape If you aim for the man in the middle and fall at his feet, we can escape Don't think Let us escape and then think Pat on the back! Bravo! Well done! In the 'Goat and tiger' game... ...you have proved you are the tiger You are beyond compare You are unbeatable Then why did you fall at his feet yesterday? For Pavalamalli's sake I'll fight the mightiest army And powder them to dust But if innocent people are dependent on me... ...I have to yield a little bit Patience is another quality along with bravery If that patience is mistaken for cowardice, what can I do? Other than that- No one needs to be ashamed for being a Vairanallur maiden Courageous men live in Vairanallur too! Fly like the wind! Tharagai, I can't wait any longer Let us plan our wedding and finish it phat-a-phut! Mother Come, dear How are you? I'm good, mother Pavalamalli, bless you, my child Mother, on our way back we were in great danger Marudheera saved us Thank you, Marudheera That is my duty Come What? What happened? I just cannot believe it Why? The demons you had arranged... ...surpassed the real Vethals! Fantastic! What an act What agility! What grace and poise! Marudheera Seeing you fight nimble-footed... ...won't Pavalamalli fall in love with you? I should think so She had better, otherwise I'll arrange for another duel What next? What?

We can go for a walk? Get inside You can leave now Don't waste your time Without my permission... ...my daughter won't cross our doorstep Look over there, dear How could you? Is this how much you respect your father? When have I ever disobeyed him, ma? That's why I used the rear entrance instead! See you, ma Pavala...? How did you recognize me yesterday? Your eyes When my sister died when we were young... ...the same eyes shed tears for me You are... ...a poem That means? You know how poetry should be? How? Like the 'mundu' worn by the women of Kerala Fully draped and not revealing Like the attire of the women of Maharashtra Covering and not concealing Like the sari-clad women of Tamil Nadu Revealing and yet concealing Covered and still opened This is the metre for poetry In that way you are... ...'poetry in motion' I think with your poem you'll make a girl surrender We indulge in so many acts Won't we excel in this? My father is intent on getting me married to my betrothed Even when you went to the neighboring land to study... ...I took good care of you in my heart Will I let go of you now? I want to share this happy news with you I can't believe my luck Tharagai and I are getting married tomorrow Why all of a sudden? You got the glow of a new groom now! If you had waited a little longer you could've got married... ...when you're 60 as a milestone ritual Don't make fun There's more You should be in the forefront and perform my wedding We'll rock it Then for my wedding night- That's too indecent if you made out in front of me Don't be impulsive You are full of youthful vigor You'll know how to satiate your future wife Your fertile imagination will be working overtime If you give me just 3 tips... ...I'll follow it to a T And mesmerize Tharagai completely You won't tell me? Then shall I ask you a general doubt? Shoot For the wedding night... ...milk and fruits are essential, right? Why are you laughing? Milk and fruits are necessary First of all you should have enough strength in your body Bless the couple I have wedded my beloved Tharagamangala My dear sweetheart For so long I was waiting for this day Tharagai...give- 'What is he looking for?' Is your father a flower vendor? What a silly question! He has decorated our cot with all the flowers in the world This doesn't feel like a bedroom More like a flower market! Is this research very important, now? Akka? How is the nuptial decoration? You have an overload of conceit How often I've told you not to call her 'akka'? You call her sister once more I'll pickle you to pieces Come out Till my 3rd baby is born don't cross my path After the 4th baby? Don't act smart with me How can you be so rigid? What happened? He barged in An innocent kid has entered my bedroom What if he gets scared? Who will be answerable to his parents? See you, akka Don't 'see us' Just scoot You take your wife and go that side I'll take my wife and- Aiyaiyo! After all it's only a cat You're yelling as if it's an elephant This is a terrible omen on such an auspicious night This shouldn't be ignored Tharaga, come with me Hope nothing bad happens All because of a cat, they won't make me strum the love-guitar God help me! The time when the cat crossed... ...Venus occupied the 4th house And Mars which should have been in the 4th house is in the 7th house Whichever way you see it... ...for another 3 days you cannot initiate your wedding vows Did I hear this right? Good Lord! Father...mother, help Astrologer sir, is there any loophole? My son is in a tearing hurry How else do you expect me to be? You're behaving like a cat on a hot tin roof here! Then I dread to think what you will do- I will make a deep impact! Every mishap has a redemption Tell me how I should atone I'll do it in the blink of an eye And start my job Redemption, right? None indeed Son-in-law, let us postpone your wedding night for 3 days No one will walk away with the water from the well Can I just fill 1 pail of well water for the time being? You are in for trouble even if you fill a cup! Get lost, man Why is your hand full of blisters? Nothing War I am getting ready for war To drive away the demons Not just me I am preparing my 3 children too What? What happened? Do you have children? Not as yet But if you... ...co-operate it can happ- What? Our next baby won't be a figment of my imagination What a novel way to profess your love Do I take this smile as a sign of acceptance or- What? Are you worried I'll let you down? I'll agree even if I am losing myself If you are the one who will let me down "Rainbow becomes a circled entity" "Cerulean sky in close proximity" "On earth, cottony clouds gather to robe this peacock-feather" "Night turns to noon And sun into the moon" "Seasons disguise to swoon" "Girl, my beloved lady why do you change me?"

'...bowing in reverence to our sacred river' '...that symbolizes our mother' '...I unite you both' Marudheera What is this? Out of the blue you stand before me as husband and wife I am very happy for you Let us announce this evening and get Malli's father's permission formally -What, my dear? -Your blessings, sir Marudheera, by anointing our family deity with 9 flowers... ...we must fulfil our long overdue vow Definitely, sir Then... ...tell us what you want You were the 1st person who wanted us to be together Get me a shawl With fond memories of you I will wrap it around me 'Over-enthusiastic' 'They've come in disguise' Demons Don't worry, Malli These boys will come to show off now and then A few pats and they will be on their way You carry on, dear I'll have my fun and catch up with you It's been a long time My limbs are tingling Why this frenzy? You know she has fallen in love with me Then why disguise yourselves and torture me like this? Did anyone call you? Go now, I'll see you in the evening I'll make sure you get your wages Looks like they won't let me complete the sacred vow Is someone else dressing up like us? Oh! It's you On my way I saw 4 or 5 demons So what? They are real Vethals Sir already warned everyone not to dress up like demons They are original demons? Marudheera...Marudheera The demons are destroying our entire village Come quick Marudheera, those fiends have set our village ablaze Can someone save her? Sir...sir! They showed no concern even for the elderly Talk to me Marudheera...? The demons have taken Pavalamalli to their palace They went this way Marudheera Sir...sir- Marudheera, I tried my best But I couldn't save my daughter-in-law Don't spare those demons Drink water Marudheera...Marudheera I want to share a secret with you Drink this water first You...you are- I was an orphaned baby You rescued me And raised me as your own child As a son, I haven't done anything for- I couldn't even wrap you in the shawl you asked Before 'aiyah' died, he wanted to share something with me Does anyone know what it is? Don't know, Marudheera You must take his place and look after our welfare There is a rumor about sacrifice and full moon night Pavalamalli was also born on a full moon night You must only save our land that's enslaved And rescue my daughter from those barbaric monsters We can win them over only through trickery Your father was very skilled in the art of disguise In the same way you should also disguise yourself like a demon Then enter the Vethal palace and bring my daughter back I have the necessary self confidence But how can I handle them with mere human power? I can remedy it This is no ordinary medicine Where footprints of humans have not made any mark... ...this is a juice extracted from rare cave plants If you drink this... ...blood circulation will speed up multiple times The body gets firm and strong to combat the force of gravity Due to this brain stimulation... ...you can receive powers on par with the demons We can also fly in mid-air like them And fight with aggression But there's a small hiccup If consumed at this stage of my research... ...you can stay a demon only for 8 minutes After that you will get back your human form Try drinking it Stop...don't go near him Move away Get back You are not Marudheera now Think you are a demon and try You can do it You can fly in mid-air Get up He flew without any wings If you ask what is impossible in this world? It is...not making an effort You have found this strong medicine And proved it Marudheera, it is not that easy to enter their fort Before that you must find a super-centenarian Machakoodan Only he knows all the secrets about the Vethala palace It seems he is 180 years old 180? One important news Kangini Desam in the north is another kingdom of demons Once in 5 years medical supplies are brought from there to this fort They suffer from rapid decrease of blood cells That is the cure it seems Don't know why But I believe the last supplies were delivered 8 years ago So you can pretend to be the demon from Kangini Desam delivering supplies And enter their fort easily You can take anyone with you for assistance Let Kodangi and Sama come with me By all means By promising to free the people... ...he is shutting the door to my wedding night plans! All of you eat and go to bed early Must wake up early tomorrow My marriage won't be consummated How does it matter if I wake up or not? What is it, Marudheera? My horse isn't moving It's scared of something What did it see? What happened? Remember what our chief told us We've entered Yazhi mountain region where invisible humans reside Invisible humans? Don't know which direction they are in Let's greet them in every direction possible Greetings -I have a doubt -What? Will these invisible people be clothed or not? They might think they are anyway invisible and not wear anything at all Then even the girls- What are you looking for? Hey demon! You fell into our trap Trying your tricks with our king? Shoot Shoot some more My turn in the center Why am I king? To twiddle my thumbs? Will it reach? That was a deliberate shot Clap-clap! He has fainted, right? Useless chameleon, faster Let us not wait any longer The 3 demons who came to destroy the land of the Villiputs And the talking bird I hereby order the spider with its poisonous tentacles to kill them Father, stop If you look at the demon's eyes, he doesn't seem evil Why don't we inquire first and then punish them? Stop winding Untie that demon's gag alone King of all the 'Villiputs' We are not demons But normal humans disguised like them We are from Vairanallur The demons have kidnapped my wife Pavalamalli How cruel is that! To save her and to free our land from captivity... ...we are heading towards Vethala Desam Is that right? Soldier, remove his fangs Thank God!

Greetings Sir, I am Kama Korkai Newton's daughter This is Marudheera He has a problem If you could help- Marudheera? You alone step forward Roll the boulder Path will unfold Roll the boulder Path will unfold Change your name Strength you will gain Note it down please, quick Write it down Give it to me In Yavana's bed Key to our fort Fort is ours If squashed, go and pee Looks like he'll add 'if queasy, go and crap' Break the scepter when the sun eclipses Break the wand when the sun conceals If you do all of this properly there is a chance you will win Win...or whatever! The door has been shut This Mock turtle could have kept his mouth shut Kodangi, foolish people speak nonstop Most of it will be sheer nonsense The wise will speak less But his words will make a lot of sense Take your hands off! Can talk less But like this weirdo, to talk half baked rubbish- That's a lot of slippery saliva He shoved his feet into his mouth! You've got yourself a place in history I've heard of bears spitting But this is the 1st time a turtle has spat on a man I'm so proud of you Here, please eat Thank you Just a small bit will do Last a whole day Alpha and Beta are here But where is Kama? Kama is right there by Sama Did you eat? I did, what about you? What is the buffalo flirting with the mouse for? I have never seen any girl in this world... ...with eyes as beautiful as yours Only if you look close enough you can actually see her! He's reeling out poetry about her dot-sized eyes! Oh no! Why are you crying? The moment I saw you my heart broke into two Kama, I love you whole heartedly This is the last straw! Now they are kissing each other You aren't even capable of that Zip your lips and go to bed Good heavens! I take a detour when I see a canal back home How will I cross this stream? This looks like it leads to hell How do we cross this? You're right in lamenting To complete this bridge and then cross will take years What if Soora can just lift us across? Idiot! We can But who will carry them? If we fall, even our bones can't be cremated! Right on time to scare the hell out of us! Roll the boulder Path will unfold Is he looking for some rabbit or what? Roll the boulder Path will unfold He's going around like the 9 planets? Our heads spin watching him move If my calculation is right... ...I need to drop this boulder in that pit You can do it...lift That's right He has lifted it Bravo! You can do it Hold tight He has dropped it in Really heavy Why does it sound like the earth is rumbling? It has come out now I don't know which direction to take That's a 'chengaluthi' leaf This is a magic leaf that shows the way! Pick it up Kama, get the book Look here, it is written If you make a leaf-whistle and blow... -Wind will flow! -Cuss words galore!! If you whistle, a frog called 'Pachai vaayan' will guide us I thought only a leader shows the way Even a frog can, huh? If it's the right path, frog or leader, does it really matter? Try blowing it once more Look! A green frog Appeared out of the blue as soon as you blew Help me up, please Marudheera, without hesitating ask the frog to show us the way Can you tell us the way to the Vethala fort? Don't blow the frog away Let's look up what's written again 'Pachai vaayan' will appear If a man who is married but not consummated his marriage... ...asks for directions and licks the back of the frog God help me! ...it will show you the way 'Why is he blowing the conch my way?' Instead of making out with Tharagai I'm stuck here... ...between this rock and a hard place Don't worry so much Just lick the frog Shut up, you turkey berry Yes, lick it Fast, just lick it! Stop it Is this a sweet offering from a temple to lick and relish? It's a frog that swallows a snake for breakfast The snake won't mind Just do it Go ahead, bro...lick My dear wife! Goddamn green frog! Tell me Where are the Vethala hills? Why is he pointing this side? Oh! So that's the way The green frog has given us the green signal (scream) The wonder drug is in this Where is he running off to without taking it? May I ask who you are? Who are you? What are you doing to our princess? Princess- Answer me Who the hell are you? When your princess was being chased by a leopard... ...were you out picking tamarind pods, huh? He is our commander He is the one who saved me from being killed by the leopard I am Jaladharanga General of the Vethala Desam Yes, my job is to pluck tamarind pods What about you? We are Kangini demons from the Himalayas Take a look at our eyes I am the prince of medicine in Kangini land I prepare the medicine from tigers usually Not tamarind pods From tiger's milk You have brought medicine for me? Not just you but for all the people of your land Hereafter see how this tiger's medicine works In that case, only I will take you there Don't worry, I am sure I can find my way there I've checked their belongings The bags only contain herbal roots and seeds Why should a doctor carry a weapon? Take it away Marudheera, they have taken away our biggest strength We are like snakes without fangs now We have entered the arena Let's see one way or the other Whoa! Magnificent! Marudheera Don't show your fear What did he say? Even if death turns you upside down flat... ...shouldn't show fear it seems Who are they? They look pathetic 'She won't eat us up!' 'Is she a queen or a magician?' Where are they from? You heard the queen, didn't you? We have brought herbal supplies from Kangini Desam I'm Marudheera The prince of healing Low blood cell count causes Neutropenia 3 people die every month You took your own sweet time to come here Shall we say we had 'the loosies' on the way Where- This royal lady suddenly flits place to place to show us her palace Tell me, prince of Kangini When I was coming back with the princess... ...I saw them near Vulture hill So he is the prince who saved my daughter from the black leopard I heard about it I am glad indeed What happened? Tell me Why the delay? Your Majesty, a violent storm battered our Kangini land All the herbal plants were uprooted That's why we were delayed How long does it take for you to prepare the medicine? Cook up something First we need to boil and strain the 'koruku' seeds Then we need to crush special herbal leaves by hand I don't care about all that When will I get the medicine? It can be done in... ...3 days When it is ready you will prove it can cure the disease, right? Why don't I hear an answer? De...de...definitely... ...we will prove the disease can be cured, Your Majesty Good Get some rest And then start your work Thank you...very much, Your Majesty This Turkey berry fellow! Who is he targeting and rolling the dice? To close our chapter of course What is your Oracle saying, Beta? It says good news will fly in from the west Good news it seems! It's our Soora and riding on him is Alpha The wonder drug We found the capsule Only after seeing this in your hand... ...my heart started beating again Soora Alpha Don't...I feel ticklish For God's sake switch the drug to another place Let's transfer it into the capsule in our bag And fill this with water Marudheera...Marudheera Soora and Alpha while collecting this medicine got wind of some news What? The girl kidnapped from Vairanallur... ...will be sacrificed in a royal ritual it seems Pavalamalli? Where could she be? The sceptre burns red hot like a ball of fire This is no ordinary magic wand In has trapped within, the souls of 17 lives Only 2 days left What we will get is... ...treasure of all treasures! That mountain must be the prison The way my stomach is somersaulting the entire fort seems like prison to me Help me stop my 'loosies' please The queen has 4 daughters, anna? 1 is the princess The other 3 come free Marudheera drink the medicine Wonder drug Save us! Was he born an adult? Yes, anna Why is he just walking instead of flying? Don't know, anna He's heading towards us -He's here -GO Turn around and go He has just 1 eye Where is the other one? When Marudheera put out his hand... ...why did Mamuzhiya stop? Even I am puzzled How did you combat such an ogre of a demon? When I'm next to a beautiful girl like you... ...danger is like eating a donut! 'He lays it really thick!' Mother What did I tell you? The medicine is underneath The capsule just has water! When you saw that Cyclops I repeatedly asked you to drink it You drank the water instead and with bravado faced him eye to eye! That's right I forgot too So what I drank was water? Then what did you think? When I held up my hand... ...why did Cyclops stop in his tracks? You should ask Cyclops himself Greetings, Royal Highness Greetings, Brave heart Goodness! Not a single girl in our clan can match her beauty What are you looking at? Do you like my dress? To tell you the truth, I can't even see any dress What did you say? Finito! They can serve us gruel in the prison Don't misunderstand what I said, Royal Highness I meant, your beauty hid everything else Alright, step in for the feast I am glad you are at the table of Yavana 'rani' ...in the royal abode of the valorous Vethals Let the feast begin Looks like if the gravy there has to be passed on to us... ...we'll need a horse to bring it Forget that Look over there What a huge crocodile barbecued on its belly Being gluttonous, don't end up with 'loosies' again To our flights of fancy! Should we also drink to our flights of fancy? What on earth is this? It is our tradition for us to clink our glasses with those of our guests Clink all you want To our flights of fancy Why should we bathe because of your flights of fancy? We take great pride in having met queen Yavana To rule 56 villages is not child's play Yes They are my people I live for them Very heartening, Your Majesty You thought I would say so, huh? Only those who belong to my Vethal clan are my people Alright Cat got your tongue, faith healer? It's the same in our land The demons rule Ordinary people are our captives Very true "Ruler of fantasia, emperor Lord of love, enchanter" "South Indian, chivalrous Crossing seas treacherous" "Expert, brainy and brilliant As strong as an elephant" "He shoots an arrow deftly with a rainbow" "Without a knife or bloodshed you will kill with your eyes instead" "Princess Mandakini Future queen is she" "Do you need a golden mountain Or a chiselled statue of a woman?"

I might as well have been stuck in the jaws of a demon Think of it as mint 'chutney' and lick it quick, anna Yuck! Green frog Where is Pavalamalli? Why is he pointing up? Has Pavalamalli gone to Heaven? You half-wit! Who? She is in the top storey Good lord! Alright, see you soon Malli? Pavalamalli? Your life is with me If I have to kill you, they have to snuff my life out I promise I will save you 8 minutes have passed Still no sign of our Marudheera Is he in some sort of danger? The priest blessed us with love, laughter and children Looks like Tharagai won't become a mother at all Hey Kodangi, only if she dies she can't become a mother Even if you die, she can give birth to children -You jinxed-mouth fellow -Alright...alright From the beginning your actions are topsy-turvy Tell me honestly who are you? Why have you come into our kingdom? Answer Nothing...nothing I hit you playfully 'Is it 8 minutes already since I drank the medicine?' Did Marudheera faint with just 1 punch? I have my doubts if he is really part of the Vethal clan Tomorrow morning Bring him to the sacrificial altar Let the people assemble Gave the wonder drug, right? Once the drug starts working, watch Marudheera in action Prince of physicians, Marudheera I have my own doubts if you're a demon at all! You won't know by interrogating You can find out only if you see me in action Send your demons to fight with me You are just a dewdrop that melts He's the malefic Saturn who will stop your pulse I melt like a dewdrop only for the sake of love When it comes to enmity... ...I am a tiger The medicine is working Bravo! Brother, it's important to know if strength is through force or skill When you lost the fight you are as good as dead Queen doesn't suspect me But the middle men are the ones who are suspicious Tell me who else should I prove to? Shall I prove it to you? Or you...? Enough Who else is in doubt? To you...? You...? Why is he playing the drums for a concert that's over? Can you prove it to me? I'm sure it isn't wrong Certainly, Your Majesty -My God! -What? 8 minutes of magic time is over That means the malefic effects of Saturn has started now You fought and defeated a demon But according to our tradition you have to take part in the climax Single Vethal duel This madam's livelihood seems to be conducting fights If you win this, I'll accept you as a demon beyond doubt This is the single Vethal-hoop Soora, quick Give him the capsule Demons can enter on one side And exit on the other The demon's body can take this heat But a human body will burn to cinders Please don't...don't, sir Please let go of him -Save me, sir -Spare him Anna, I can hear the sound of the funeral conch -I don't hear it -Why? Because I'm already dead! Kaput! No one can fool our queen Yavana My daughter princess Mandakini... ...will marry the brave Marudheera I shall announce the wedding date soon "Like a baby calf playful and sprightly this beautiful girl captivates me" "He's like a two-tailed sparrow To this handsome hulk, a big hello" "On your forehead vermilion red dot adorned" "On my cheeks, lassie kiss me repeatedly" "Man of intellect, my dear" "I am a bud about to flower Tendril in your hand tender" "You are a challenge for me" "On your forehead I want to kiss you Tickle you pink is what I want to do" "Deer, honey, peacock, koel All these blended is you, damsel" "My precious princess, sweet jaggery Come to me, my river Mandakini" "Like a baby calf playful and sprightly this beautiful girl captivates me" "He's like a two-tailed sparrow To this mischievous imp, a big hello" "Your Imperial Majesty, dear I'm your lucky mascot deer" "You are a man, one and only Don't kiss my honey layered body" "Hey maiden so beautiful You're a mermaid graceful" "Your legs are pillars of art Nectar that you are, don't part" "With eyes that thieve don't make me conceive" "Cheek to cheek, don't take what I cannot partake" "Deer, honey, peacock, koel All these fused is you, damsel" "My precious princess, sweet jaggery Come to me, my princess Mandakini" "My dear wish-fulfilling jewel Slender like a palm tree, archangel" "I will make you mine, dearie Kiss me, don't leave me" "Brave warrior marvelled You're like teak wood chiselled" "You are my betel leaf's areca nut my taste buds yearn, don't walk out" "With a bouquet of roses red don't tempt my heart that's innocent" "Deer, honey, peacock, koel All these mixed is you, damsel" "My precious prince, sweet jaggery I am yours forever, Mandakini" "Like a baby calf playful and sprightly this beautiful girl captivates me" "He's like a two-tailed sparrow To this naughty fellow, a big hello" Marudheera passed even the Vethal test! First and foremost, without anyone knowing about it... ...close Marudheera's chapter Call for that Pei-azhagu kuruvi? They seem so distressed He has got up...finally My favorite demi god! I'm very confused myself Why didn't I die in the Vethal single hoop test? Don't know Marudheera The palace washerman wanted to meet you secretly I saw this leaf in your bedspread I've been eating this from when I was young Do you know what it does? To control the demonic power within you... ...and show you as an ordinary man ...is the extraordinary nature of this herb Then am I... ...a Vethal? Yes Yes, you are a demon Do you know who your father is? With his single intense glare like a volcano... ...Pulivendha has the ability to set ablaze 10 men First see if he rushes to your aid Oh God! Ask your Pulivendha to come now Ask him to come You dare laugh at me? Can't you hear the sound? Our prince has come to our rescue Our savior with immense power The knife which will take your life 'The people were overjoyed by your father Pulivendha's timely arrival' 'Your mother Pushpa radha bearing you also arrived' 'Pulivendha had left his home 18 years ago to learn all the arts' 'He returned because his people of Vagainallur called him to save them' Why are they tying up our brave men and killing them? Who is to blame? You or the king? The new General Jaladharanga 'Your grandfather Karunthelnandha...' '...has done a lot of good for all the villages here' 'His only blunder was his choice of General' 'From that day onwards, he made everyone dance to his tunes' 'But he hid it very well from the king and the princess' Through generations in all the villages... ...2 sacred rituals take place as part of our tradition One is when the seeds are sown called the 'Uthira pooja' The 2nd is during harvesting called 'Paadha pooja' After this wretched Jaladharanga came into our lives... ...we haven't performed 'Paadha pooja' at all This thanksgiving to God should be performed day after tomorrow But it won't It will, ma Day after tomorrow Thanksgiving to God will be performed in Vagainallur I'll be here till then I haven't been born to rule as king But to ensure my people don't lack anything 'The king and princess were waiting for the arrival of Pulivendha' 'But they received only a message from him...' '...in which he had conveyed everything, the whole truth as it is' 'For many years 'Paadha pooja' has not been performed in Vagainallur' 'The Vethals are looting the innocent people' 'He promised to come with details of the mastermind behind this' 'Reading his scroll...' '...the king and the princess were right royally confused' 'Jaladharanga was shocked' 'He met a cruel sage called Koduvari immediately' 'The sage gave him a powerful voodoo ring' 'To draw the princess into a black magic spell' With the hair you gave me from the head of the princess... ...I have cast a spell I have made a sacrificial ritual in the cemetery And made this ring with witchcraft 'If the leg of the spider in that ring is pressed...' '...the green smoke emanating from it will fly through the air' 'Despite the number of people present it will attack only princess Yavana' Your Highness? I told you to leave 'If the ring is broken...' '...she will become a woman possessed' 'To imprison the king, Jaladharanga used the king's daughter as a scapegoat' 'The entire control fell into the hands of Jaladharanga' So Yavana 'rani' now is a mere puppet on a string Along with his savagery, Fate also joined hands to play an evil game 'On that specified day, 'Paadha pooja' in Vagainallur started on a happy note' 'Jaladharanga resorted to nabbing Pulivendha the crooked way' Pulivendha...? God! Our children...oh dear! You look just like a tiger Not only to look at Don't worry They are not your children But mine I will definitely save them One more step forward and your children will be corpses Children are the Heavens bestowed to us even when we are alive After butchering them which hell will you rule? I'll stoop to any level to get the reins to reign It will not happen till we are alive -YES! -Of course After your arrival their fear has evaporated But it has entered you The wrongdoer may have a 1000 weapons But a good soul has only 1 People That's why I'll destroy you with your own weapon If even 1 drop of blood is shed from their fragile bodies- If you do not wish to witness even 1 drop of blood here... ...you must drink this poison ...to the last drop Not just these children Even if you kill all of us... ...we are not prepared to lose our prince We will not let that happen This love is enough, ma I'll forsake my life for you how many ever births I take I thought as much when you did not combat face to face with me Will you show us your bravery aggressively? Or end your life submissively? If I drink that poison will you let them go? I promise I trust you Don't do it You are our heir We are willing to lose our lives You should live Please don't do this Don't...don't Listen to us Do not sacrifice your life It is a leader's duty to protect every single life in his clan Don't drink it It's your duty to obey my order For the sake of the people... ...I will embrace even death with joy Don't do it If you die, who will protect this land? YOU If all of you love your motherland bravely... ...a king is not needed This land will soon belong to me You will be dust to dust ashes to ashes Jaladharanga I am a seed In the place where my seed is sown another liberator will blossom General, his wife has given birth to a boy baby He has bloomed just as you predicted Where is he? My baby Oh God! Pushpa...! Kill this baby Along with the people set the whole village on fire 'Men cursed by sage Koduvari who had been turned into birds...' '...were living in the mountain side' 'They saved you from the jaws of death' 'Nestled you in a nest with an egg by your side...' '...they sent you to safety by nudging you into the river' Is Soora one among the cursed men? Yes No wonder he talks Jaladharanga enacted a drama as if a black leopard killed your parents 'Princess Yavana got married and a girl baby was born' 'Jaladharanga killed her husband and as usual blamed it on a leopard' 'And convinced everyone' 'The queen had no idea what was happening' 'She believed everything' 'The princess crowned herself queen' 'But from that day onwards Jaladharanga was the mastermind' 'The cruel sage asked Jaladharanga to perform...' '...a ritual that would bestow immortality to him' 'Only a girl with royal lineage can perform this ritual' 'On every solar eclipse day...' '...he made the innocent queen sacrifice a maiden born on Full moon day' 'If this was performed for 18 consecutive years...' '...the queen will get immortal powers' 'And if Jaladharanga being a bachelor had physical relationship with the queen' '...he would become immortal too' 'In the end he intends killing the queen too' 'This is his plan' They have sacrificed innocent victims for 17 years without any hindrance This is the 18th year Tomorrow is the solar eclipse The last sacrifice Marudheera, somehow stop that ritual please Otherwise mankind will be in his clutches And rot along with the dust to ashes Only you can stop it Where is Marudheera? He didn't tell me where he was going Take your hand off my shoulder We are caught, huh? Then what? I am Pei-azhagu kuruvi We are just actors You must ask the one who asked us to transform like this That is only fair You are begging bloody slaves who fall at our feet Are you trying to play games with us? If you come with love we know to wag our tails If you come to fight we also know... ...with our swords to make you wail I've understood almost ¾ of this Change your name Strength you will gain You are Marudheera When you knew you're a demon you got your strength If squashed, go and pee Goes above my head We got that wrong, it means take the 'single vethal hoop' test I walked on fire and won That's true, right? Break the sceptre when the sun conceals What does this mean? Let us think Alpha, Beta, Kama You must now go to the royal altar of sacrifice Ready Kodangi and Sama you should enter the jail Somehow save my grandfather Soora, you have to keep an eye on the various parts of the palace Certainly, Marudheera Let tomorrow dawn favorably to the people Marudheera has met the washerman I've ripped him apart and made him confess What is the truth? The assailant from Kangini Desam who has come to destroy you... ...is none other than Marudheera Marudheera You intend destroying me? You start the sacrifice I will have the pleasure of destroying Marudheera You have come in search of death, Marudheera Generally everyone will run at the sight of death But Death will flee for its life when confronted by a brave heart Won't that Cyclops also be inside?
