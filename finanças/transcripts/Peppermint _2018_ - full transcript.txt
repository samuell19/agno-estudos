Mom! - Riley! - She's back. - Riley! - Just keep going. I know you can hear me. Honestly, I don't know what you were thinking. Sorry, Peg. I said I was sorry. This parking lot is where we set up. Everybody knows that, from here to the Pottery Barn. We have earned this spot because we sell more Firefly Christmas baked cookies than anyone. Maybe if you actually showed up to a Den Mother meeting, you'd know these... Well, not all of us can sit around in our perfect little houses south of the Boulevard, Peg. Some of us have to work. I will be lodging a formal grievance - at the next Den Mother meeting. - Okay, you do that. I don't think you're Firefly Troop material. Neither one of you. Come on, Penelope. What an asshole. - Don't say that. - Well, she is. Well, maybe so. But still... You should've punched her lights out. Punched her lights out, huh? You can't go around punching people who are jerks. Then you're just as bad as they are. Mom, I know you took the morning off work. Thanks, for trying to help me. Do you know how amazing you are? Happy birthday, get in the car. Run, run, run. Go, go, go. Listen, I wouldn't ask... When do you think? Next month. Right. Yeah, thanks. - Hi, Daddy. - Hey, squirt. - Oh, how are you? - Hey. - I'm good. - Good. - I should be home by 4:30. - Okay. Someone's gonna have a birthday party. The other kids will be there by 4:00. Can you handle 30 minutes on your own? How many other kids? All my friends, Daddy. Chris North, everything in your life has prepared you for this moment. Oh, hey, I'm late. Love you. Love you, bye. - Love you. - Bye, guys. Bye! Come here, birthday girl. Oh! Oh, hi, Mr. Watson. I'm late. Sorry. Well, we'll talk about it later. I gotta do some Christmas shopping. - Okay. - And I need you to close today. - Oh, today is actually... - Dee Dee called in sick. So you're closing. - It's my daughter's birthday... - You asked for extra hours. I'm giving them to you. You're closing. Are you sure, Mickey? Are you really sure? - 'Cause, don't put me in a situation... - I got kids too, man. Ten minutes, our lives change. Our kids' lives change. Nobody knows, nobody will know, all you gotta do is drive. I'll take care of everything else. I don't know, Mickey. I don't know. You wanna get Riley a house, right? Good school for Carly. This greasy hand shit, it's not gonna get you there, man. This will. Hi! I'm here. Happy birth... Where's everybody? Nobody came. Nobody came? Riley, Peg. Let's forget that little snafu in the parking lot ever happened. We're having a little holiday get-together today, Penelope invited the whole class. I think Carly's invite must have gotten lost in the mail. Feel free to stop by. If you're not doing anything else. I'm sure you remember the address. South of the Boulevard. Hope to see you guys. Told you. You should've punched her lights out. You know what, buddy? We don't need them anyway. It's your birthday. My birthday sucks! Carly, language. It does. We're gonna go out for pizza. Um, we are, just the three of us. It'll be fun. And then we're gonna go... we're gonna go to the Christmas carnival. - Yeah! - Oh! Yes, the Christmas carnival. And when we get there, we are gonna ride every ride, and play every game. We'll do all the virus and germ infested... Whatever. But I'm good with that, it's your birthday. - And then... - Ice cream? - Ice cream. - Ice cream. Yes! Heck, yes. Ice cream, yes, as much as you want. All right, we're gonna have a big night. Go get a jacket. - Let's go, go, go. - Yeah! I'll be ready in a second. I'm sorry, I just... Hey, honey... it's not always gonna be like this. You promise? Yeah. I promise. Come here. This is Mickey. I'm not here right now, please leave a message. Mickey, hey, it's Chris. I'm out. I'm not risking it. It's not worth it, man. All right, listen, I'm sorry. Uh, give me a call when you get this. - Where's your dad? - He's out here. Oh, good. Carnival! Yay! All right. Here we go. Carnival. I'm so excited. ♪ Jingle all the way ♪ Oh what fun it is to ride... ♪ It's me. Is the boss around? I found the other one. Seriously, you trying to rip me off? Did you really think you were gonna get away with it, Mickey? Hey, boss, it's for you. It's Cortez. I have to take this phone call. I hope you don't mind, Mickey. Talk to me. What you got? I'm tailing the other guy. What do you want me to do? Smoke him. Make an example. A loud one. Mickey, is this what you wanted? Huh? Is this gonna make all your problems go away? Feels good, huh? Have some folding cash on you. Right? Right? Fucking puto. Yay! I'm the king! Give me that one. High five! I kept my eyes open almost the whole... Oh! Oh, I hope I look smart. - Aw. Not so much. - Look at me. You're a booger. - Pretty charming. - Oh, ice cream! Let's get ice cream. - Come on. - We're coming, we're coming. Hey, what'll it be? Uh, two of your finest Rocky Roads, and... Yes, and whatever the little lady... Peppermint. Double scoop. And a peppermint double scoop. - All right. - It's her birthday. - Happy birthday to you. - Thank you. - ...with the... - Yeah, I agree. Goodness, look at that. Can I try that? Do you like it? - Birthday, kiddo. - Bye, sweetie pie. - I'll grab a napkin. - Okay. Okay. - Do you mind? - Yeah, you got it. - Thank you. Have a good night. - Bye-bye. - I know. Every day! - We're gonna have your birthday every day. Hey, make sure we can get it in the car. Ready? Three, two... Adult female, 35 years old. Gunshot wound to the head. Severe cerebral hemorrhaging, vitals holding. Closing up. We're good. Can I take a look? It's messed up, I get it. But you need to get your game face on. We got a job here, all right? Shit ain't easy when it's a kid. It's not supposed to be easy. That's the difference between us and them. You were supposed to call me the moment she woke up. You don't wake up from a medically-induced coma like flipping on a light switch. The gunshot may have missed her brain, - but the cerebral swelling... - But she's gonna be all right? "All right," is out of my hands. When her memory returned she... We had to restrain her and she had to be sedated. Mrs. North. - My name is Detective Stan Carmichael... - Detective. I've been waiting to speak to you for a long time. I'm very sorry for your loss. Forgive me for jumping in so abruptly, but we have three suspects in custody, who we otherwise will have to release tomorrow. Detective, this is really not the time. I... I can talk. We think that what happened may be linked to your husband. There were rumors he was involved in a plan to rob a drug dealer named Diego Garcia. He wouldn't have to... He wouldn't do that. No, yes, you're absolutely right. We recovered a voicemail on his friend's telephone, your husband did refuse to go along with it, but, word had already gotten out. And got back to Garcia. Now, an informant has given us a very credible lead, but no witnesses are willing to step up. We know everything, but can't prove anything. Detective. I think that's enough now. You get some rest, Mrs. North, I'll come back. But I, uh... thought you might wanna have this. I saw them. All right, bring 'em out. Let's go. Get in there. Um... It's number five. Number five, step forward. Take 'em out. Next group. Number three. Number three, step forward. That's him. Four. Hmm. Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. Hey, thanks. What's the matter, you not hungry? Tell me what that is. That would be a detective badge. That would be all they found on the last cop who went after Diego Garcia. It was in his locker, hanging in his locker here, inside Metro Homicide Headquarters. Garcia has people on the inside? Garcia has a nickname, La Guillotine. There's a reason for that shit, Stan. Chris North didn't even rob Garcia. He just considered it, and he's on the wrong side of the grass with his kid. Whatever happens with this case, let it happen. Don't be stupid. You'll only get dead and it won't change anything. Hello? - Oh, Mrs. North. - Who are you? I hope you don't mind I let myself in. Um, I'm... I'm a friend. Uh, do you wanna have a seat? What do you want? Eviction notice. I can only imagine how awful all of this has been for you. I mean, how does one even begin to recover from something like that? Why are you here? I just, uh... I just wanna give you a bit of advice. The road to recovery has to begin somewhere. The recognition that um... as gut-wrenching as it is, in the end, nothing's gonna bring your family back. I know, and that's the regrettable, yet unavoidable truth. Eventually, maybe not right away, but eventually it'll be time for you to move on. New place, new clothes, new memories. A new life. What is this? Lorazepam. Lithium. Risperidone? That's an antipsychotic. Hey! I think it's time for you to leave. Maybe you've made a mistake. Your memory is a little hazy. I'm just putting it out there. Maybe you didn't see things the way you thought you saw them. Hmm? Get out of my house. Get out of my house! Get out! You think that you're gonna have justice? Make them all pay? They won't. Get the fuck out! Is there anything else you would like to ask the witness, Mr. Henderson? One last question, Your Honor. Mrs. North, just to clarify one point. Did you see them get out of the car? - No. - Hmm. Did the car ever stop moving? No. And yet you identified my clients as the alleged shooters? - They did it. - Objection, Your Honor. Calls for legal conclusion. Sustained. - Mrs. North, we're interested in facts. Not opinions. - He just asked me a question - and I just answered. - It's okay. You identified my clients, correct? - Yes, I did. They did it... - Okay. Okay. And are you currently on any antipsychotic medications? What? - Lorazepam. Lithium. Risperidone? - Wait. - Is there anything else we should know about? - But that's not... - Wait, that's not accurate. - You identified not one, but three men in a moving vehicle at night from 30 feet. - After a month in a coma... - I saw them. - and a mental breakdown... - It's not something you forget. And under the influence of antidepressant and antipsychotic medications. Excuse me, he's not listening to me! Is it possible that your recollection isn't what you thought it was? No. No further questions, Your Honor. Wait, but you're not hearing me. Can you help me out? You're the district attorney. Can't you do anything? I didn't even take those pills... It is the opinion of this court that in this preliminary hearing, the evidence is insufficient for a juror to reasonably conclude that the State has met its burden of proof. I see no reason to hold the defendants over for trial. Wait a minute. This can't be over. - These men killed my family. - Mrs. North, you're excused. No, they killed my family! - This guy showed up in my house. - You are excused, Mrs. North. No, I am not finished! - You are excused, Mrs... Mrs. North. - He offered me money! - No, no, no! I am not done! - Mrs. North, you're excused! - They are killers! They're fucking killers! - Mrs. North. Bailiffs! Get away from me! I'm gonna kill them. Bailiffs, remove this woman. Mrs. North, I'm remanding you to a mental health treatment program. Next case. Why is she bleeding? What happened? She wouldn't stop banging her head into the bars. - She's all yours now. - All right. Mrs. North? Riley, it's Detective Stan Carmichael. Do you hear me? Hey, guys, come on, come on. She saw her family get murdered and the guys who did it just walked. How about you lighten up? Clear? One, two, three. - Where is she going? - County General, psych hold. That place is a nightmare. County General, psych hold. That place is a nightmare. Hang on. Let me make a call. Hey! - You all right? - Yeah. Sorry. Well, you called it. She'll turn up. One way or another, they always do. Carmichael, 3-8-7-7, Gang Homicide. Don't you look especially pretty this morning. Thanks for showing up. I've always been a firm believer in beauty sleep. Pro tip. Wait until you're dead before you embalm yourself. Well, that's new. ♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells jingle all the way ♪ ♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh ♪ ♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way... ♪ - Good morning, Lisa. You got a minute? - What? Somebody drove a truck into a gun store out in San Bernardino a couple of nights ago. The place was a class-three dealer and military-grade stuff. ATF called us after reviewing the security footage. Uh, it was a woman. They got a partial frame of the suspect's face. Give it to the DHS Fusion Center. Let them run it through their facial recognition system. I did. Got a possible match from customs on a stowaway incident, container ship, at the Port of LA three months ago. Uh, your name popped up on the case file, so I... Inman. Inman. Are you maybe thinking what I'm thinking? Carmichael. Who? Yeah, sure. The FBI wants to talk to us. Feds? Did you guys run out of terrorists? How come the feds care about a squirrelly soccer mom? Didn't she smack you in the head five years ago? Smacking dumbasses ain't a federal offense. Ha-ha. Bank robbery is. The night Riley North got away from you, she stole $55,000 from the bank where she was employed. Are we talking about the same Riley North? Bank robbery? Mm-hmm. She just disappeared, completely off the grid, as if she just ceased to be. You're shitting me. She wasn't the type. I agree. A woman with no priors, even if her family is brutally murdered doesn't just up and take 50 large and then take off. Got my attention. How many times did you betray your oath, Your Honor? I think that you're so goddamn corrupt, I don't even stand out. Well... So, here's the deal. If you can tell me my name, I'll let you live. I mean, you'll eat out of a tube the rest of your life, but you'll live. You ready? Do you remember my name? Interpol tagged her four months later. Used her real name in a hospital in Hong Kong. Showed up with a dislocated shoulder, facial fracture, ruptured spleen. - Car wreck? - Don't know. She left before we could have her apprehended. She vanished. Every now and then, a lead trickles in from somewhere. Some we can almost substantiate, some we can't. She's a shit magnet. Why are you wasting our time? Then we found this on YouTube. Wait, that's... that's Riley North? Herself, in Europe last year, under one of the four identities we've tracked so far. She got really, really good at staying off the radar. So she spends the last five years bouncing around the world, learning how to get into trouble. And? We don't exactly know what she was doing. What we do know, is that she arrived in L.A. three months ago. Security cameras got this during a gun shop burglary a few days ago. She only took military grade. Automatic rifles, high-capacity shotguns, specific ammunition. She knew exactly what she was looking for. She's back. And today, you found the three guys that allegedly killed her family. Strung up, execution style. Do you know what the date is today? - Come again? - The date. What's today's date? It's December 21st. Five-year anniversary of her family's murder. This stuff wrapped around you is det cord, explosive rope. You can cut through anything with this. Cut through trees, cut through concrete... Corrupt judges. Watching someone take everything from you. All you have, all you're ever gonna have, just gone. Hurts, doesn't it? And knowing that it's all over, and there is nothing you can do about it. You didn't serve justice, Your Honor. I will. Carmichael. Hm-hmm. What? Okay. Thanks. Steven Goldman and Robert Henderson, the DA and attorney at that hearing, - five years ago? - Yeah. Goldman was found face down in his swimming pool and Henderson's house burned down with him in it, last night, both of them. And that's not all. LAPD bomb squad is currently onsite at the residence of one James Stevens, criminal court judge, recently retired. Some sort of explosion at his house. There's barely enough left of him to fill an evidence bag. Don't think I need to tell you who he was. We gotta go wide with this. APB, the media, the whole deal. That looks good. Stack it up. We need to talk to you. - We have a problem. - What? Just a minute. Our informant called. She got a judge and, uh... And a lawyer we paid off. Smoked some of our homies, too. The ones we sent to take out her husband. When the fuck was this? Like, five years ago. Is there a problem? No, just uh... Go and get Jessica out of the car, bring her in with a couple of drinks. And that thing? Put a paycheck on her head, call it a day. Some personnel stuff. You know how it goes. Got ten more tons... Your bullshit ain't why I'm here. You know, you shouldn't play games with the cartel. I came to deliver a message from my father. It's just a misunderstanding. One shipment goes missing, maybe it's a mistake. But two? In a week? You think I tried to steal from you? That I lasted this long by being stupid? Everybody wants to be a big dog. Little dogs trying to eat my food. That's all it is. Hey, baby. Get the fuck outta here. There's something you need to remember. You are still a little dog. Don't let our business be interfered with again. Who's that for? It's for you. Thanks. Is he okay? He drinks. I have to take care of him sometimes. Stop requested. Please use rear... Dad. Come on. Bye. I told you not to speak to strangers. Hey. Where'd you get that shitty toy? Sit. Sit. Give me your wallet. Oh, okay. Okay. I'm gonna need you to stand still, please. All right. What do we have here? Bryan Hartley, 1214 Harlow Street. Open your mouth, Bryan. This is one of those life-altering moments. Do I have your attention? I want you to take your boy Christmas shopping. I want you to give him the time of his life. I want you to grow up and be the father he deserves. Do you understand me? I understand. - Say it again. - I understand. - Do you swear? - I swear. 1214 Harlow. I will never forget you, Bryan. Are we clear? - Yeah? - Yes, ma'am. What are you still doing here? Come on. You ever sell him anything else and I will blow you and this place to bits. - Do you understand? - Mm-hmm. - Do you have a car? - Yeah. Give me the keys. Consider it a rental. Hey. You're in the wrong place. Oh, actually I'm not. Get the fuck out of here. - What's up, man? - What's going on? Listen, I'm about to get this money, homes. ...in this normally quiet upscale neighborhood. Maureen, can you tell us more? What do we know about the suspected bomber? North is suspected to have been behind today's bombing and of possibly killing up to five others. Authorities believe her to be armed and extremely dangerous. If you see her, please contact the police at the number on the screen. ...so called "sweet killer." What could be expected for her next move? What will the law enforcement agencies respond with? What the fuck? Come on. Let's get the fuck out of here. Come on! Oh, shit. - Hi. - Oh, God. I have questions for you. You're not busy, are you? No. A fire has partially destroyed this downtown pinata store, Crazy. Crazy, crazy. She's fucking crazy, man. You already said that, Marvin. Yeah, well, I'm saying it again. So, you decided to tell her everything. The whole damn operation. Yeah, but you guys would have done the same thing. It's... I'm so impressed by how fucking stupid you are. How much did she take? She... Well, she didn't take anything. She... She burned all the money. It's the last fucking shit that I need right now. Boss, I'm so sorry. You know that I would never... It's just these were some extenuating... Shut the fuck up! Trust me, we will have a short... a very short conversation about this in a minute. Double security. Put that bitch in a box before sunset. Before she gets us all killed. Thank you, Joanna. Today, Los Angeles has witnessed a disturbing series of violent events which some are speculating are part of a pattern, possibly even the work of a single suspect. According to sources at the Los Angeles Police Department, everything seems to lead to the same name, Riley North. So, who is Riley North? Looking to social media, theories abound. One possible link, Riley North's husband and daughter were gunned down in a drive-by shooting, five years ago. There is a storm of online speculation about a connection. Folks, I'm gonna need you behind the tape, thank you. Thirty-four, Asian, male. - Yeah, yo. Check it out. - Roughly... Well, I got a dozen witnesses who suddenly went blind and didn't see shit. So we got that going for us. What the hell are the Koreans doing, slumming it with Garcia? Money laundering. Garcia's using their infrastructure to launder his cash. These fuckers ain't gonna be happy. It's gonna get a whole lot worse if we don't get ahead of this. We got every black and white in this city looking, every camera. Her face is all over the news. Well, she knows what she's doing. It's turning into a typical social media shit storm. Garcia's gonna love all this attention. Hey, man. There's, uh, something I want you to take a look at. Over here. Stand back, thank you. Well, this is a hard sell. You honestly think that Riley North did this? Well, your Fed girlfriend thinks so. - My what? - Stan, my man, you gotta focus on the task at hand. It's embarrassing. The only interest I have in Agent Inman is professional. - If you say so. - Oh, Jesus Christ. All right, I'll hit up Gang Narcotics and see if they have any intel on suspected Garcia locations. Get a list, set up some Code 5s, do surveillance and see if she shows. You be careful who you ask those kind of questions to. - Fuck's sake. Here we go again. - Oh, hey. It only takes a few guys in the right places. Watch your ass is all I'm saying. And you say hi to Bigfoot for me. What, lover's quarrel? What about Bigfoot? Yeah, we were debating who gets to be impressed by your FBI prowess. I won. So what are you thinking? Riley North arrived in LA almost three months ago. Aren't you guys a little curious where she's been hanging out? You have a crime analysis department, right? Yeah, come with me, I'll take you there. Cartel up our ass. And now the Korean Mob? What's she gonna hit next? Bet Marvin told her about the lab. - That would be my bet. - Fine. Then we send everybody there and just kill her when she shows up. Boss. How'd she know about Marvin? The one guy who happened to know everything. And she doesn't kill him. How did she know? She must have been watching us. Oh, you think? Those missing shipments, it was her. She's been stirring shit up, finding out the moving pieces. Bitch has been fucking with us for weeks. If that's the case, then maybe she's expecting us to send everybody to the lab. That dance is over. Bitch wanna have the motherfucking lab, I will give her the motherfucking lab. The system tracks reported crime in real time. From that data, we determine where to send our resources. Stop problems from spreading. Any anomalies? Areas of higher violent crime than expected? Besides tonight? Going back a few weeks, are there any areas that stand out? This can't predict where she'll turn up next. It might tell me where she's been. Everywhere she goes, people get dead. She has to be living somewhere. Maybe I can locate where she's been staying, her base of operations. Find her that way. Nothing. No sector or neighborhood stands out. No abnormal spike in crimes anywhere. It was a good idea. I was impressed. Really. Oh, you wanna see something really interesting? I was looking at this before you got here. Social media is lit up with support for her. She's a multiple homicide suspect. Well, not to them she's not. Now that people know what she's been through, they're rooting for her. Look. Zoom in. There. What's that? Skid Row? Why does it look safer than Bel-Air? Hmm. That's odd. Has it always been like that? You keep the data, right? Can you give me a minute? What's going on? You see anything? I don't see nothing. She's in. Hit the remote. Uh... Okay, so the crime pattern started changing about three months ago. Oh, shit. What's that? Multiple reports of an explosion. Fire. Industrial warehouse, downtown... You stay here. I'll catch up with you. - Catch up? Where are you going? - I got a hunch. But we didn't talk about a hunch. What? Radios are lighting up. - What happened? - Downtown warehouse just exploded. Is it her again? I'll check it out. Was it on the list of Garcia locations you got from Narco? - I don't know. - What the heck does that mean? Did you get a list or not? It... I haven't heard back from them yet, okay? But I'm on it. They're probably just busy, there's a lot going on right now. Yeah, right. By the way, Bigfoot says hi. Oh, come on, Moises, it doesn't mean anything. They're just... Hey, are you okay? Hi. Hey! Hey, what the... Hey! Hey! Get out of my car! Wait, come on! Give me my car back! It's them. They got her. What's the word? Hey, boss, we smoked her ass. Are you sure? She was up in there when it went up. There's no way she's living through that shit. Trust me, she's gone. You fools are moving up in the world. Be calling some shots pretty soon. Thank you, boss. Now get your ass back here. We'll be calling some shots! Whoo! Mm. That's a cop. How do you know? Who else would be dumb enough to bring a new car here? Hi. Can I talk to you guys for a second? You lost? I'm looking for someone. Looking for someone. No one's looking for nobodies. Isn't it dangerous at night for the kids? Not anymore. Why's that? 'Cause we got an angel now. Is that car following us? What are you talking about? I told you to lay off that shit, man. - You're getting paranoid. - Shut the fuck up. Shit. What the fuck's up with that guy? Oh, no. Ah, yeah. Boss, check it out. What makes you think Riley North did this too? 'Cause I saw her jack this dude's car and just take off. And she was pissed. Social media continues to explode with debate about female vigilante, Riley North, still on the loose. It's them. Open it. Kill the lights. Stay with the boss. Don't, please. Please, don't. I'm not here to hurt you. Shh. - He... - Go. Fuck. Don't fucking move! Who the fuck are you? What do you want? What do I want? I want justice. Papa? Come here, baby. Let's go! Boss? Boss? Boss? Where is she? Where is she? It's okay, baby. It's okay. It's okay. Jefe, we gotta go. We gotta go now! We gotta go now! Riley? Good evening, Peg. I remembered the address. Sorry, we missed the party last time. Riley, you're fucking crazy. Everything they said about you is true. You know, I couldn't help but notice, you're not wearing a ring on that finger anymore. He left you, didn't he? For someone younger, prettier. Go fuck yourself. Oops. Yes, he... He left, okay? You're right, I... Please. This is... This is not gonna bring her back. I... I'm very sorry that Carly and... Don't say my daughter's name. Okay. I won't. I... You're gonna get locked away. You're gonna go to jail for a very long time. They... They will catch you. This is not... You don't wanna be doing this. - Thank you. - I'm going to burn your house down now, Peg, with you inside of it. Oh, good. Riley. Riley! Get back here, Riley! - No! - Stop squealing, Peg. - I'm just kidding. - Riley! No! No! Riley! Moises. - Got that info you wanted. - Shoot. All right, this place is owned by an overseas company out of Belize. So, any number of assholes can be... This is Diego Garcia's house. Hey, I'm just saying. Hey, you seen Carmichael anywhere? I can't get him on the phone. Ain't my turn to watch that baby. Hey, asshole. If you see him, tell him to call me. - Getting a little worried about him. - Roger that. Hey, Barker. Barker. What the fuck's going on in Narcotics? Carmichael's been trying to get a list of Garcia locations from you guys and he gets blown off? You got somebody trying to protect that motherfucker? - Hold on, Moises... - No, no. Don't "Moises" me. I've been trying to call Carmichael all goddamn night. - What? - Yeah. Calls, texts, emails. Even went by his desk twice. We've been trying to coordinate with him since this thing started. Who told you we didn't call him back? He did. I think there's another cop. Where's your backup? What took you so long? Sorry, they're a little behind. What do you got? I snooped around a little. Look what I found. Damn. The van wasn't even locked. You'd have to be insane to leave a vehicle in this neighborhood. But unlocked, with an arsenal in the back? People are too afraid to steal from her. I don't think it's fear, Stan. It's not some software glitch that makes this area low crime. It is low crime because of her. So how do you wanna play it? Set up surveillance, apprehend her when she returns. - We can take her alive. - Alive? She's obviously been watching Garcia's operation for weeks. God only knows what she's figured out. We get her to talk, we take down him, his suppliers, everything and everybody. If the rumors are true, Garcia has someone tipping him from the inside. And she's gotten closer than we ever will. I'm gonna head back to the office, I'll coordinate the inter-agency, FBI, DEA, LAPD, and Internal Affairs. Hey, Inman, I have to tell you something. - Yeah, what? - I'm sorry. I know where to find her. Stay where you are. You gather your crew. Tell those fuckers it's time to earn their money. I don't care if we have to burn the city down. But this shit ends tonight. Understood? Let's get these motherfuckers. I got someone in the 911 center. Any calls from this area will route through him. We gotta to do this fast. Is this smart? We're announcing ourselves. I don't know that she's here yet. If she's here, we'll find her. All right, let's go. - Hey! - Get up! Get out of here. Check over there. Mom. Mom. You have to wake up, now. We got something here. Warehouse, west of the alley. Whoa, whoa, come on. Talk to me, guys, what's going on? Did you find her? Maybe. Going in now. Holy shit. Man down. Cortez, we heard gunshots. Did you get her? Cortez. Listen to me. Get outta here. Leave these people alone. Just give me Garcia and go. Or so help me God, I will kill every single one of you. Your choice. She's bluffing! I can hear the pain in your voice. You're hurting. You're hurting bad. Out-manned, out-gunned. How you really think this is gonna go? I'm gonna shoot you in your fucking face. And then I'll pretty much figure it out from there. I'll see you soon. You've reached Special Agent Lisa Inman. - She's not answering me, either. - Shit. We gotta find her. See if we can get a location on Inman's cell phone. - Find out where it last pinged a tower. - Yeah, already ahead of you. Hi, this is Special Agent Li. I need a cell phone location. - This is Barker, Narcotics. - Special Agent Lisa Inman. I need a stingray van immediately, Los Angeles area. - 323 555-9357. - What? Yeah, yeah, right now. Where's the remote? Where's the remote for the TV? - Where's the remote? - Here. - ...prove it to you right now. - Moises, we got the van. Look. Okay. You see, that guy is a dirty cop. Motherfucker. That scumbag right there, that is Diego Garcia. He is the man who killed my entire family. If you have a news crew, come on down, and if you have a cell phone and you wanna come and take videos, come on down. And if you are the LAPD, this is where the party is. I'm not going anywhere. Come and get me. I'm Riley North. I'm in Skid Row, I'm on the corner of Olympic and San Julian. - We got a location! - Riley? Let's go! Let's go! Let me go! No! - Stop. - Hey. Come on, man. He's just a kid. You're in this. You've always been in this. You want out, just nod. No, you're right. I'm in. Maria! Hey, soon-to-be dead bitch, you hear me? I've got someone here I want you to meet. Say your name, sweetheart. Tell her your name. My name is Maria. Maria, here, she's about to die because of you. Damn. You just don't seem to have any luck with little girls, do you? No! Stop! I'm gonna count to five. Then I'm gonna blow her fucking head off. One... No! Two... Maria. Three... Four... I'm coming. I'm coming. SWAT team is ten minutes behind us. Forget it. We're not waiting. Drop the gun! Are you okay? I knew you'd save me. I knew it. You were right. Here I am. Let her go. You have to go now, Maria. You have to come with me. - I can't. I wish I could. - No! - Get her outta here. Come on. - Just go. Get safe. No! Please! No! No, get off me! Please! Get off me! No! Stop. Stop. Are you scared of me? Is this where you have one of your flunkies shoot me? Coward. You don't wanna get your hand dirty, huh? Get her up. - I'm waiting. - We gotta get outta here. She's toying with you. Stalling. - Just get it over with. - Shut the fuck up! Let me have a little fun here. No! You hit like a girl. Oh, Jesus. You see that? She ain't toying with shit. I must say that I'm a bit disappointed. I thought you were gonna put on a real fight. Make it fun for me. You wanna hear a secret? You should've listened to Carmichael. LAPD. Stay where you are. Drop your weapons. Police! Police! Police! - You sold me, puto. - No! Uh, you guys can't go through here. Stay back. Yo, hey! Move! Move! Out of my fucking way! Riley North! Step back! We got him. We'll take care of it. Like you did last time? No, he ain't getting away. Just drop the gun. Riley! On the ground! Don't do it. I'm begging you. Please, Riley. You're a crazy ass. You'll spend more time in prison than me. We're not going to prison. Cease fire! Cease fire! Fuck! Where the hell is she? Airship, Airship, what do you see? You got eyes on anything? Negative. Negative. We lost visual. Total clusterfuck. She could be anywhere. We're setting a perimeter ten blocks out, but... Who knows? Don't bother. I know where she's going. I've missed you. I've missed you so much. I miss you so much. Riley. My husband. My daughter. They're waiting for me. Please, just let me die. I can't do that. This isn't where the story ends. It is for me. Need an RA! Now! Thank you. So is Riley North a vigilante, folk hero, common criminal, or all of the above? Public opinion seems largely in support of her, but the law may not agree. The LAPD's stance was clarified just an hour ago by Chief Matthew Rogers. The Los Angeles Police Department's position is clear. Riley North will answer for her actions. And she will stand trial for multiple counts of homicide. Questions? How you doing? Detective Beltran. I'll take over for a bit. Why don't you grab yourself a cup of coffee? Okay. Hi, Riley. Remember me? How you feeling? You killed a lot of very bad people. You took down a massive drug operation. Exposed dirty bastards, in my own department. There's not a cop I know that... Well, let's just say, some of us wish things didn't have to be this way. Well... Hope you get better soon. Subtitles by explosiveskull
