We're gonna have, I've got a baseball cap and several gifts to give you for answering my questions. - [Man] I ain't going. - It's your turn. - [Man] Last time he nearly killed me. - It wasn't you he was trying to kill. - I didn't see nobody else. - He was having one of them nightmares. - Still, I ain't going. - [Jud] It's your turn. - Jeez, Jud. [laughing] - [Jud] Come on, boy, go get him. [country music] [laughing] ♪ I spent my paycheck ♪ Spent up all of it ♪ I didn't wait up ♪ My girlfriend waitin' for me - Pershing? Pershing! - Ahhhh! [glass shattering] [screaming] - It's me, Les! Sheriff's waiting for you. [breathing heavily] - I'm glad Mr. Santier has prepared to accept the natural order of things. You're lucky he didn't take them back. - I'd bite him if he tried. [giggling] - Too much pulp. Not enough ice. - Aren't you afraid he'll bite you? - No. Would you bite a friend? - Wouldn't do much good if I did. - Thank you very much, okay? We're gonna call you if we need you again, okay? Thank you. What a lovely old man. - Dale ought to be here soon. - Dale is like a cat. She likes to play with them first. - Okay baby, it's time for you to go to sleep. [car honking] - Keep sucking on that fire water, boy, you gonna burn yourself. [car honking] [country music] - Golly, I ain't never seen one like that before. - Yeehoo, look at Boot, he's crazier than a hoot! - Looks like I'm gonna have company in jail tonight, huh? - [Clifton] Arnold. - Town character. Does it all the time. Name's Boot. One hour after they boot him out of jail, he's back in again. - Good job, your mother would be very proud of you. - [Boot] Nope, that's okay! We definitely went on the half shell, man. Went on the half shell. [yelling] - Local color. Name's Boot. - Dale's got everything covered, gentlemen. - This is an important meeting, Jack. You don't want any surprises. - Very impressive. [bells ringing] - Right on time. The local drunk. [country music] Seems to be everybody's charity case. - A strong drink is the worst kind of temptation for a man. He's fallen a long way. - Mmm. - Morning, Sheriff. - Morning. Pershing. You wanna be my deputy, you better look the part. - [Man On Radio] Set it for clear, Petticoat, right at Petticoat. - [Sheriff] This is Carnival, Pershing, it ain't the Wild West. - Always pays to have an ace in the hole, Sheriff. - Do these days right. Boot's in the back, he wants to stay, you let him. See you Monday. - [Pershing] See you, Sheriff. [country music] [snoring] [water running] - Ready, gentlemen? Good. Then I think it's time we called in Mr. Santier. [phone ringing] - Spin the dial and carefully listen as the tumblers fall. You get one number, you get another, and another. Then one magic day, you get them all. You get the combination. And the world stops turning against you. It starts to turn just for you. [bluegrass country music] [guns firing] [groaning] [door squeaking] [dramatic music] - I brought your ice. [gun firing] - Get your, get your gun, man! Get, get it! Get your gun, man! Get that gun! Get it, go ahead and get it! [breathing heavily] - You still breathing, Jack? - Barely. Come on over here, Dale. - Why, Jack? - 'Cause I got something to tell you about, baby. - I'll listen from here, lover. - You lied to me. - I never lied to you, Jack. - Yeah you did. You told me that Clifton, Clifton was gonna accept things the way they were. - This is the way things are, Jack. - No it's not. [gun firing] - [Boot] Get it! - I'm all right, I'm all right! - You're all right, you're all right! The key! The key, man! Pershing, the key! All right! Which one is it? Shit! Which one? Goddammit! Pershing, which one? - [Pershing] Shit. [gun cocking] - Right there. Drop the piece. - You getting paid for this? But you'd do it for free, wouldn't you? - [Clifton] I'm so sorry. - If you take me with you, I'll live. - [Clifton] I can't do that. You're no longer whole. - You can make me whole. - [Clifton] I can do a lot of things, but I can't do that. Shhh, go to sleep, go to sleep. Shhh, go to sleep. That's my baby.

[guns firing] [device beeping] [explosion booming] - [Boots] Where we going? - [Pershing] Montreal! - Montreal? - He wants me to follow him! - Don't do it! - I got nowhere left to go! Besides, he'd find me anyway! - Let's just walk away! Just close the door and walk away! - I walked away once! I should have stopped him! The body count keeps rising, this time I'm gonna face it! - You're a stubborn bastard, Pershing! We're in this together! - Don't do me any favors, Boot. - I ain't doing ya any favors! I owe you a few! ["Amazing Grace"] - Dale? - Oh, it's one thing I didn't plan on. - I'm sorry. - So am I, thank you. She was a beautiful, charming girl, but I don't cry over the losses. You taught me that. - I never taught you anything you didn't already know. You've done very well, Clifton. - [Clifton] So have you, Bobjoy. All clean money, everything is spick and span. It gives me the sweetest feeling inside, it really does. - What's the next step, Clifton? There's only one rung left on the ladder and I'm on it. - In my opinion you deserve everything you get. - So do you. [laughing] - Come on, Ted. Well there's nothing like playing with a stacked deck, is there? Gentlemen. - There's enough room at the top for you and me. What would you say to being equal partners? Just the two of us. - Just the two of us. - I've been like a father to you. - Yes you have, you truly have, but come on. I mean I'd stab myself in the back to get ahead. - Show me some mercy! - You want me to show you mercy? Okay. I'll tell you what. I'll fix it. So you don't hear anything. [guns firing] - Thanks, Boot. You just be here when I bring him out, okay? - Well you know, you ain't the man you used to be, man. - I'll be whatever I have to be. - [Boots] Pershing! You got everything you need? You got money for a bus ticket? You speak any French? No! [speaking foreign language] [cars honking] [man whistling] - [Man] Taxi! Taxi, yo! [sultry piano music] [singing in foreign language] - Would you like a drink, come have a seat. [singing in foreign language] I can be a dancer, a stripper, or even a bedtime story. - How about a letter? - [Woman] What would you like in the envelope? - A message for Sierra Larange, wish you were here. - [Woman] Are you going to lick the envelope? [laughs] - This oughta seal it. [singing in foreign language] [whispering] - Where'd you find that? - It found me. [door clicking] Aren't you gonna ask me what I'm doing here? - I got a feeling you're the kind of man who shouldn't be asked what you're doing. - Why's that? - 'Cause you're gonna do it anyway. - I'm gonna look through your friend's stuff. - That's different, most people are interested in what Dale doesn't wear. - [Pershing] What about you, Sierra? - Being a stripper can be real fun, you know. - How's that? - Well for one thing, when we're kids, we're the dangerous types who always seem to be falling out of trees. - Dale fell this morning. - She's not getting up, is she? - Not the way she fell. I'm gonna open this locker, you got a problem with that? - This town, nobody ever stops anybody from doing anything. - [Pershing] Bosco. - That's Clifton Santier. - Clifton Santier? That's cute. What's he do around here? [scoffing] - Clifton does everything. - How does he get away with that? - I guess he does everything very very well. - [Pershing] How do you know him? - Before Dale ran with him. - You ran with him? - It was good. - [Pershing] I bet. - In fact it was the best for me so far. You're here to kill him? - If I have to. Tell him. - What? - Tell him Pershing's here. [phone ringing] - Kling. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Sierra. The drunk's in town. Should I call Clifton? - Please Arnold, let me decide. - Hush up, I make the decisions. - Couldn't I make one just this once? Please? - Okay, Lester. On the one hand, information. On the other, Clifton hates to be interrupted. Reacts badly. - You better not call him. - [Arnold] The Deputy, the drunk, he's making a nuisance of himself, asking about Dale, you, talking to Sierra. - Well then send someone to remove Pershing. - [Arnold] Broker for the drunk. What about Sierra? - She's no asset to my portfolio, lose her. Goodnight, Arnold. [light classical music] [speaking foreign language] - Never knew you when you weren't using something, Rooks, go right ahead. - Horoscope. Libra. [sniffing] It says I'm destined to meet someone from a past life. Thank you! - I couldn't keep him here. - Us Libras change very fast. - Rooks, I tried, all right? - Not hard enough. You see, in the plan you were set to go down tomorrow, but we gotta move you up. See, Santier paid your ticket, so you go to sleep today. By the way, he thanks you for telling him about the drunk. [breathing heavily] [speaking foreign language] Money I'm paid. I dance alone. - [Pershing] Take the guns off of Miss Lee. - Who are you? - [Pershing] Somebody you're never gonna meet if you don't lower those guns gently. - [Rooks] I just got one question. - [Pershing] What's that? - Something my horoscope asked. Did we meet in another life? [gun firing] [screaming] - No, but we'll meet in Hell. Call the police. - What is the police? - Sorry about the blood. - Hey! Wait up! - [Pershing] So you were supposed to set me up? - [Sierra] I can't believe I was such a fool to always do everything Clifton asks of me. - [Pershing] I know. [police sirens wailing] - Know what? - You ever heard the story of Parzival? Give me that, let me check. - No. - Parzival was a knight. While he was in action a terrible thing happened. He spent the rest of his life dealing with that guilt. - You feel that way? - I am that way. Come on, you better put this on, cover up the blood. Come on. Let's go. Is anybody gonna recognize you at this hotel? - [Sierra] 20 bucks they wouldn't recognize their own mother. - [Pershing] All right, you got 20? [phone ringing] [siren wailing] - Yes? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. He just put a tag on Rook's toe. - He won't be shopping here anymore. - He never shopped here, Lester. He was a size 36 small. - That's why you never liked him. - As ma always says, think big or don't think-- - [Both] At all. - [Sierra] Pershing. Who would name a kid after a tank? - My father. He named me after the tools of his trade. - Now you do what your father did? - No, he was the General. I never made it past Private in the regular army. You, you missed a spot. [water running] Come here. [police sirens wailing] [soft piano music] Your eyes. One's green and the other's hazel. - It's the other way around. [laughing] You know, I've taken my clothes off for men much worse than you. - [Pershing] I don't think so. - You don't give up, do you? - Never surrender. - What If you had nothing on your side? - You always have something. [water running] [ominous orchestral music] - Ladonne, What are you doing here? - House detective gave me his keys. - What do you want? - I want the 25 riding on the head of this scum sucking drunk! - 25? If he's such a scum sucking drunk, why does killing him bring that big a prize? - I don't care, I want him. And I want to trim another piece of your blue legs, baby! - You did that a long time ago. - Sure I did. [laughing] Clifton got you used after me. Now it gets you debt with a drunk and I get the 25 grand. - Why don't you come lie on the bed next to me and get away from that door? - Ahhh, sure. [chuckling] Listen you drunk bastard! Get out here or I'll make the walls wet with this big bitch's guts! [guns firing] [screaming] [groaning] - Gotta be more careful the way you talk to a lady. You all right, come on. [light acoustic guitar music] [wind howling] [gun cocking] - [Bags] You know what that noise is? - Mind If I look? - [Bags] You can. - [Pershing] Do I know you? - [Sierra] It's Big Jim Bags, Detective second grade. - What are we doing here, Bags? - Saw Ledonne Francois go in the front. Heard some gun music, figured somebody should come out the back. - Know who I am? What I'm worth? - Uh-huh. - This town's a bunch of machines working together? - Yeah? But better to be really alive for a week than be part of the machine for your life. - You never answered the call. [siren wailing] - I figured you'd be a man, Mr. Quinn, who falls forward in that dark. Like me. - What if you don't come out, Bags? - Then at least I dared. Like you, Quinn. - We gotta find the car. - Look out. [car approaching] Don't let that cab see you, Clifton owns all of them, they tell him everything that happens on the streets. - He's got the whole town in the palm of his hand. - Not Ruth. Thank God for Ruth. [whistles "Amazing Grace"] [thunder crashing] - Just left the Venture Hotel. That's not far from Ruth's, that's where she'll take him. - Let me do it, Arnold. I know I can. Give me a chance to do it on my own. - Mother would never approve. - Why do we have to tell her? Arnold, please? [clock ticking] - Watch the girl. And take some men with you. - I'll make our mama proud, Arnold. - [Sierra] Ruth? Ruth, are you there? [speaking foreign language] - Ruth, I gotta borrow your truck. [speaking foreign language] - Well the first man I was with just tried to kill me and he was probably hired to do it by last man I was with. - Well, well, well. And you? You look like you do some drinking. - Way I do it, that's an understatement. - Well maybe we should all do the drinking. - Ruth, you haven't had a drink in three years. - [Pershing] Footsteps in the jungle? [gun cocks] [gun cocking] - Drop the gun, mister! Couldn't you change your shirt? I'd hate to kill anybody dressed as bad as you. - [Sierra] Is that you, Lester? - Move! - [Sierra] Lester? - Me and my boys. We're waiting for you to bring him to us. As mother used to say, where there's sugar, there's coffee. Sierra, come with me and be my girl. Please? Or stay with them and you'll be a fine red mist. - You know Lester, I never knew a big boy like you would be interested in a girl like me. - Do you have an investment in him, Sierra? - Only investment I have is in staying alive, Lester. You know Lester, now that you're working without your brother, I'd really like to tell you something. I always knew that big boys carried big guns and this is your little present. [groaning] [guns firing] [groaning] [gun firing] [gun firing] [gun firing] [grunting] [dramatic music] - The only girl Lester ever had. - I make you feel dangerous, Sierra? - You make me dangerous. - Hey, get going, it's not over yet. Car's in the back, key's under the mat. - [Arnold] I was told I'm an idiot, Clifton. I was hoping you'd be there with me. - I'm really no good at that kind of thing, it's just something that you're gonna have to do on your own. - Please? - [Clifton] Look, you're a big man. Tell her it was an accident. - I never lie to mother. - Well then go tell her you sent her baby lamb off to slaughter. - You're making me lie to her. - No no, that's your choice, buddy. - I'll have to change my tie. - You do that. And get Lester out of the morgue. [sobbing] [thunder booming] - Wait for me here, okay? - I got nothing but time. [police siren wailing] [gasps] - Hurry. - [Pershing] I didn't shoot him in the face so you could have an open casket. I got a message for Bosco. Can you remember it? Or do I have to carve it In you, fat fuck? Shit. [gun cocks] [Sierra screaming] - You're gonna love this. - Rather you hit me than talk to me, Arnold. - You know what I like to do? [grunting] I like to bust up a guy's guts. [grunting] And then I do his kidneys. [grunting] And I make sure that if he's still alive, he spends the rest of his life begging for their beating to the men's room! - I bet that's where you get all your dates, Arnold! [groaning] - Poor boy wasn't so tough. Bring the bitch over. We'll shoot them both here. [grunting] [coughing] [groaning] [grunting] - I'm just letting you live so you can tell him you weren't good enough! [yelling] And when I find him, he won't be good enough! [groaning] Tell him Hell's coming and I'm bringing the fire! - Riddle, bring Mr. Kling a hot cocoa. Bring me a tea. - [Riddle] Five sugars and a twist of lemon. - Arnold, I really really hate to see you like this. - Bosco, he called you Bosco. He said something about the hand of God. - That was the only time in my life he was more powerful than I am now. Africa. He and I alone then. I thought he died there. - How did that happen? - It's very easy. I betrayed him. There comes a time in life where you have to betray your teachers or you don't learn. [soft jazz music] - This looks good. - Aren't you afraid of being seen? - That's the idea. Jack Daniels. - I guess you know Clifton even better than I do. [Bags whistling "Amazing Grace"] - [Pershing] So what are you doing here, Bags? - Watching. - Yeah, what do you see? - I see a man who's falling into his past. - Would that be so bad? - Well it depends on how you look at it. - So you're not gonna try and take me for the reward? - Only reward for me is getting to know a fool like you. [whispering] - Hello? - Sierra, turn around and look. Come here. So good to see you. Come and sit with me, come on. - I did everything you asked me to and you tried to kill me. - If I wanted you dead, you'd be dead. - You scared the hell out of me. - I came here because I wanted to see you. You remember what you used to say to me when we're alone? Come on, you remember. - Blonde hair, blue eyes, empty head, perfect lover. - I want you to take this. Ask him for the other one. Tell him I forgive him. I'm taking you back, Sierra. I want you to come back to me. [jazzy music] - Where is he? - He said to tell you that he wants me back. And he wants you too. - And you? What do you want, Sierra? - I want you, Pershing. And I wanna leave now. - Look, I'm not leaving without him. In cuffs or a body bag. - Pershing, he found us! He was watching us, nothing can stop him. - You talk about him like he's a God. - Well in this town he's the closest thing-- - Sierra, will you just start the car and drive? Please? [car revs] [dramatic music] What are we doing here? - [Sierra] It's Dale's apartment, I almost forgot something. - What? - My lucky boots, I loaned them to Dale. - Didn't help her much. - She didn't wear them. Lucky boots. My dad gave them to me last time I saw him five years ago. - Where is he, in jail? - No, he put people in jail, he was a cop. Never married my mom. - How come? - Mom said cops don't marry hookers. - We can go now, right? - No! I need a margarita. [dramatic orchestral music] - Sierra, could you make tea please? Tea with five sugars and a twist of lemon? - That's very sweet of you to remember that. - Bastards are the ones you never forget. - Yeah, well I couldn't forget you either. - What do you want? Why'd you set me up, Bos? - It's simple, I had to see if you still had it. Obviously you do. - What If one of your clowns got lucky? - Well, then God doesn't want you. And if God don't want you, then neither do I. - I should've shot you back there on the bridge. - Maybe, but you see, your biggest problem was you thought they would trust us in Africa. We were the hand of God. - You think too much of yourself, Bos. - And you, you think too little. - You betrayed me, Bos. You betrayed everything! - You betrayed yourself. You know, I don't see fire in your eyes anymore. Maybe I was wrong. Maybe you're just some rummy circus clown, what do you think? - You think you're gonna talk the bullets out of this gun? - I know you wouldn't kill me. - [Sierra] Tea's getting cold. - Bound for glory again, huh? [chuckles] - Sierra, did you tell him we were gonna be here? - Pershing, I swear, I didn't even know we were gonna be here. - Come on, you think I need a stupid broad to find you? - Where to? - Straight. Hang a right at the corner. - Good guys, bad guys. They're all my guys, Persh. I mean you're never gonna make it out of here. [chattering over police radio] - I'd rather fly dark right now. - I don't want you to get hurt. - I'm the one with the gun. Stay away from him. - Hey, can I get a little help here? Don't tell me you're falling in love with him. He's a scum sucking drunk. Come on, I mean do you really think you can open to him the way you do to me? Do you? - Clifton, you think you can see inside everybody's soul and reach in and grab it. - I can. - Don't flatter yourself, you're losing. - Okay. Okay. [dramatic music] [thunder booming] - You drive, come on! - Pershing, police! It's over. - Shit, don't try anything fancy, Bos, I'll put a bullet right in your heart. - [Clifton] You remember the last time we were this close? - That bridge. Tobololi River, Africa. - You told me you'd drop me if I dropped the bridge. - We had a cause. The mission was to drop the bridge and not kill refugees. - Cause. It was war, total devastation. Do anything to win, you know that as well as I do. - We won that day. - You had a gun right at my throat, you couldn't shoot me. Just couldn't pull the trigger, could you? I don't know why, man, I, I didn't get blessed in the river with you. I swear to God I thought you died and went to Heaven. - I woke up floating in that river. surrounded by all those dead bodies. Women and children, all their faces looking at me. How come you don't see those faces, Bos? - How come you forgot what you were, man? - The river. The river, man, every time I close my eyes I see them. [sighing] I dragged myself out of that river. But I've been dying ever since. Why'd you come after me? Why? - 'Cause you're the only friend I ever had. Friends are supposed to help each other, they're supposed to make each other better. [light orchestral music] - Control. [phone ringing] - Yes? Stay on it! We're moving and moving hard! - [Dispatcher] 73-5, code six, 105 North End, Route 52. - Hell Pershing, you've really fallen into nothing this time. [birds chirping] - So how many more are we gonna put into the dark Earth today, my friend? - If all goes well, none. - [Clifton] Aw, come on, who are you kidding? It's gonna be your biggest show yet. - [Pershing] You know Bos, you only get one roll of toilet paper a week in jail? - You guys look sharp, it's time to earn our keep. - We're gonna make a lot of cake when we get Santier back. - Yeah, but let's not forget all that money will only buy us a little happiness. - I can settle for that, Styles. - About 10 minutes, Boot will be here. - That's too long. Better load up, brother. [dramatic orchestral music] - Pershing, someone's coming. - [Pershing] Shit, let's go. - It's Bags. - Bags, what the hell are you doing here? - You got serious trouble. - This has nothing to do with you, why don't you go home? - I couldn't let you go without saying goodbye. - You're a leper, Bags. Outside the camp of men shall your dwelling be. - How much time we got? - [Bags] That's the one thing that you ain't got. [car approaching] - [Clifton] There's no surrender now. - [Sierra] There never was. - [Clifton] Never is. - Is he running or is he rolling? I hear his mother put him in ballet classes. [laughing] - Is it true the drunk was an American in Africa? - Yeah. When you kill him, make sure you keep on killing him. - You know I still got a gift for you, Persh, if you want it. - [Pershing] I'm all ears. - Kiss my ass. - [Man] Dead center. - I got 10 men. Now we're 12. - We're the jury. [laughing] [dramatic music] [grunting] - [Pershing] You still running son of a bitch! [coughing] - [Clifton] Getting old, bud - [Pershing] We're gonna run back now. Fast and low. [snake hissing] [chuckling] - I think we'll just take a moment, okay? See, this is a copperhead. The most dangerous snake in the world. And I think he'll do exactly what I say. - That's his fault. - And you? You could be just like him. Doing just what I say. Following me again. - I could never follow you, Bos. - Oh. But you see, you used to. You just don't realize it. See, there's no difference between you and this snake. It kills because it's its nature, just like you, my beautiful friend. Go ahead. Take the life. Come on. Yeah. See? Take your real life back. Attaboy. [breathing heavily] Beautiful, huh? Don't be afraid, he won't bite you. Take your life back, baby. Feel the power. Feels good, doesn't it? Let me release him for you. Take him home. Take back your life. Come along with me, buddy. You see? - Bos, the devil wouldn't want your soul. - You're probably right, but the two of us, we could probably take over Hell. [chuckling] - Oh, we'll go to Hell together.

You let me walk, and I'll let you fly with the broad! - I beat you Bos, it's over! - Never surrender, don't you get it? - Surrender, you've been captured already! It's over! [Sierra humming] ♪ That saved a wretch like me ♪ I once was lost, but now I'm found ♪ ♪ Was blind, but now I see [humming "Amazing Grace"] [suspenseful orchestral music] [guns firing] - Keep on top of them, force them down! [guns firing] - [Pershing] Boot! Boot! What are you doing? - When I make my move, move fast, man. - [Pershing] Don't do it! You don't wanna try to make it. - Come on! [gun firing] - Boot! [explosion booming] Go, move. [heavy breathing] Go, go, go, go. Back, get back. [breathing heavily] Get up, get up, come on, come on. [gun cocking] [gun firing] Ah! [gun firing] [gagging] [grunting] My leg! - When you get tired of living the good life, look me up. Get him to a hospital. [grunting] - Hold on. - [Pershing] I'm all right, I'm all right, just tie it up, tie it up. Yeah, tight, tight, yeah. [groaning] - Arnold, good job. Just a little bit tardy, yeah? Let's go. [gun cocks] - [Arnold] No further. - Quit being my eye on him. - You're nothing now, Santier. You were brought down by a drunk. [gun firing] [grunting] [grunting] [gun cocking] - I think I may have been just a tiny bit overcritical of Arnold's performance. [breathing heavily] - Sierra, there's gotta be a church bell in here. Find it, when they come ring it, okay? - Give me the gun. Come on, Pershing, tell her. Tell her it's just like the good ol' days, huh? - Give him the gun, he'll need it. - Gun, baby. - Do it. [gun cocks] [groaning] [dramatic music] - Pick up your gun, Bos. [groaning] - Ahhh! Okay, okay, just one, please, just one, okay, no no, please! Come on, please please please, just, you love me, right? Come on, just one? One? It's good, it is good, right? No, no, no no no no more, right? No more, right? - It's okay. It's okay, Bosco. Clifton, get up! Get up, man! [Clifton muttering gibberish] It's all right, it's all right, Bosco. Come on, come on. Come on. You're okay, you're okay. You're okay, man. All right, all right, all right. - Kinda like in the winter and this place, thorn of crowns on the grass, he whispered to me. She'll think of the snakes. And then she'll speak in tongues. They shall speak in tongues! - [Pershing] Bos, you're with me! - No! - This is just an old wooden church, man, that's all. - No, not only a church! He'd come into my bedroom and drag me out of bed. Take me to a little old church. He had his bag of 12 snakes and he'd put them out on the fucking ground and he'd say Bosco, Bosco, catch 'em, boy! And I'd say but dad, what, what if they bite me? And he, "Bosco, if they bite you, then God don't want you. "And if God don't want you, then I don't want you neither." - But you always caught them, right? You always caught them. - Yeah. I really hate my father. And I hate God. [heavy breathing] [guns cocking] - Oh my God. [hissing] [bell ringing] - Get up. They come in, they come in-- - They come in-- - Shoot the light. - Watch the floor. - See the Sheriff. - See the Sheriff. [guns firing] Motherfucker! [gun firing] [bell ringing] I got him. [heavy breathing] [groaning] [dramatic music] [heavy breathing] [gun firing] [breathing heavily] [breathing heavily] - You shouldn't have come looking for me, Arnold. - You insulted my mother! - Night, baby. [gun firing] [groaning] [bell ringing] [groaning] - Ouch. - You look like shit. It hurt a bit? - No, it just hurts like hell. - You and me. We really could've been something together, you know? - Nothing I wanna be, Bos. - Well, I'm outta here. You're gonna have to shoot me in the back if you want me to stay. - [Pershing] I'm coming after you, Bos! I'm coming after you! [groaning] - I look forward to it. [gasps] So long, baby. [light acoustic guitar music] [screaming] - Clifton, stop! [gun firing] - Nooo! [guns firing] [groaning] - I had something really great, I really did. Does it hurt? [sobbing] - [Pershing] Christ. - Did we win? - We never win. We just live. [upbeat folk music] [singing in foreign language] [singing in foreign language]
