Film Studio Devini and Kisi Productions present a Film by Inara Kolmane Spouse. Yes! I was just thinking about you. What exactly? The same thing as always. Of course, the same. What? I am going to my uncle’s funeral! Of course, today! No, I did say. I am going to the funeral, and I will also take a look at the inherited house. Yes, I have people who can sell my house but I have no people to send to the funeral in my place. And ... original screenplay by Arvis Kolmanis, Inara Kolmane Ok, honey. Bye. cinematography by Uldis Jancis original score by Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson, Örn Eldjárn directed by Inara Kolmane Could you tell me the way to the cemetery, please? You don’t need to go there. They’ll take you there! On the other side of the river. We are strangers and cohabitants in front of You. Oh Lord. Like our fathers, our days on earth are like shadows without independence. This place is not for us to stay but we are searching the next. Through one man the sin has come in this world, and through sin the death has nestled among men. As you all have sinned. From earth thou came, earth thou shalt become. Closest of kin to the deceased first... Are you Tomas? I called you. Janka. I was asked to give you the keys. You will find the house behind the slaughterhouse. The only one there! May he rest in peace... What’s up? Where did you go? I went to your place - no one there. I was looking for you like an idiot, but you are drinking vodka with that old trout... Let’s go to your place! Why weren’t you at the funeral? I had to work. They brought cows. Besides, to be honest - what is he to me? He means nothing to me. Do I mean nothing to you too? Mona, I’m sorry. Alright, next time I’ll come. Let’s go, Mona! Mona, please... I’ll join you soon. Thank you... What are you doing here... Hallo... Yes... Already? Of course, I’ll be there. Do you have a car? You are by car, right! Yes... Let me out here. Mona, I can’t handle it anymore... Take the kids away! Henks, pigs are waiting for you! Cows came too. Let them live a while longer... My blouse is stained in blood. Have to put it in cold water otherwise, stains will stay. Bastard... Stop it, Henks! Get away... What's wrong with you? - Off... Get dressed... I said, get dressed... Let’s go! Henk! Give me the key! Drop it! What are you doing, bastard? At the door! People are walking here! Shoo, stupid! What has the dog done to you? You have to love your neighbour... Well I’ll leave if you lend me some brass for a beer. Neighbour! Borrow it from these neighbours of yours! A tramp feeds tramps! Now the same happens here. A cow escapes from the slaughterhouse, nobody knows where it is. It’s ok if there is one cow missing. But then another one disappears! Imagine, cooper, Janka, is looking for cows now! A cop looking for cows! Listen up, what Henks has messed up? The inheritor has started to seduce the girl. A handsome man, posh house, money too. Of course she won’t be in need of Henk. Well, of course. But the guy can’t work, goes crazy. Pigs sliding on the conveyer belt and he’s standing there with the saw in hand and dreaming... Will become a drunkard just like Arkady. Some meat, sir? Very fresh, just arrived. Madam, the one that eats animals can say that is not killing anyone, but when he buys meat, he is paying someone else to kill for him. Why should I be spending money on that? Hey! Fingers all thumbs? Dzintra! Get here someone broke a jar! I’ll pay for it! No needed! Oh, sorry! Oh! It’s you are alive! So you haven’t found the cemetery! What? Be a sport, lend me some brass for a beer! If you give me some, I'll tell you a secret. I’ll tell you, what you don’t know. Ah... yeah. Take it! You gave some to me after all! Shit, I won’t ever forget it! Listen! What now? I bet you did not know it! Pigs have their tails curled when alive and straight when dead! What? I left my blouse and my bag here... Oh! What’s wrong with your hand? Let me bandage it. Spouse. Where are you? Is it still raining? No, I was swimming. Ok. Alright. Can’t you bandage it?! It's so simple, look. Did you live here with the old chap? What do you mean by it? If you real want to know, I had a room here. I can understand it surely. Country has long been free, women are free too... Many do this. They even go abroad to live with rich old men... Why do you have to run away? I did not mean... Sorry, I really didn’t mean it! Mona, I’m sorry. Smells good. What kind of tea is it? If one drinks this tea he looks young forever, never dies and is able to walk on water. As a matter of fact, you don’t deserve such a tea. To have tea and walk across the river? Are you laughing at me again? It has cinnamon. And the Chinese... Oh, Chinese... I wonder if Jesus was drinking cinnamon tea too. The Ancient Chinese believed if one used cinnamon with toad’s brain for seven years in turn... With what?! I’m allergic to cinnamon. Let’s have some whiskey. I’m allergic to whiskey. Okay. I’d still like to change. And then I’ll leave. Wait. You don’t have to run away at night. You can stay here. Especially once you have a room here... It’s no problem. Well... Maybe... In point of fact, I cannot get into my flat... The key must be broken, I cannot unlock the door. I told you it’s no problem. Besides, you could take me around the town. For I don’t know anyone here. In Latvia I haven’t been outside Riga for ages. I go to Copenhagen or Berlin, Paris more often... Well then... Good night... How ’bout the tea? I woke you up! I did not want to... Well yeah... Can I still offer you a drink? I’m doing some cleaning, washing the floor... You like it? That sound. Oh, the song... Yes! I love France. I even studied French for some time. Don’t you like it? I don’t like women singing. It‘s strange, isn’t it? No, there’s nothing strange about it. I don’t like men singing. But... I can also... You’re upstairs, and I’m downstairs... I can change the music if you want. We could sit and talk... You’d tell me about my uncle. Who was he, anyway? He was a photographer. Good night!! Good morning! Good morning! I thought you left... I went for a swim. You’re a sleepyhead... Well yeah, if one washes floors all night, it is hard to get up in the morning. Thank you for cleaning. I was going to drive to town, but now we can go together. Is it always necessary to drive? If you want to see the town it is better to go by foot. I will show you the shortcut. This is a strange place. Don’t you feel it? Your uncle could also feel it. He used to come here since his childhood. He told he had lived abroad for a long time but nowhere was feeling as good as he felt here. We met here. And then... It was my fault. He was old and I used to tease him... Well... for being afraid... Just like you are... What happened? - He... fell down. - Here?! No, no! He was not killed. You see, it was my fault. He wouldn’t have fallen... if not for me. So I started to help him. To clean up, to go shopping... Aren’t you afraid? Could you... jump down here? Me? Afraid? Girl, are you mad? Let me go! You wanted to see the town, right? Hi! Oh he's a star here, or what? No! That is a plaque from the communist times. Arkady used to be very sensible in his own day, he organized various concerts. Then all the mess started, unemployment. Many are leaving the town. Why don’t you take it away? Who is going to do that? Lenin also was removed only recently. Besides, the board casts a good shadow, the roses don’t wither. I’ll be back in a moment. Please wait. Just don’t get me wrong. It is a present in honour of our meeting... I just wanted to please you. No... They are too expensive. I told you, don’t get me wrong. It’s just a kind gesture. You better try them. - They don’t fit me. - Let me... I told you they don’t fit me. What are you doing here? Looking. For a cow. In my house? I knocked. You probably did not hear. Another cow has run away from the slaughterhouse. Your house is the closest to it. Haven’t you seen it? No!! What’s that? From India... Mona birdie gave it to me. She said it’s better to breathe this smell than drinking vodka. I think - you can do both: breathing and drinking. Double high! It stinks nicely, doesn’t it? My little one, we’re going to learn how to sing now. I hate all this... Henks... You see, I’m talking about blood, get it? You don’t give a shit. If I could have some other job I wouldn’t saw pigs. You would saw them anyway, Henks. Do you think I don’t know what you are doing after your shift? I know! You keep your mouth shut! I’ll be silent! Henks... I’m sometimes thinking I could also fuck like this. I’m completely sober when I’m thinking it. And some voice is talking to me at times like that, saying: Arkady! That’s right: Arkady, Arkady... A voice like Mona’s... Henks, let’s get some chicks! Oh... quiet! Lonka! Play our song! A granny popped in the slaughterhouse and slipped on a pig shit. Now her chopped up carcass lays in a super market for a superprice. Will you let me in to spend the night? I don’t have my key again. Are we going anywhere? Get lost. I have to go to work! Hi, Maruta! I was out of coverage. No need to worry, Juziks has the signature rights. He knows what to do. That’s all, Maruta. I am busy. Hi. Have you seen Henks? I guess he went that way. Have you gone totally mad? Boss is already trying to kick your ass. Henks, he’ll throw out if you don’t learn how to drink. I could both take the hair of the dog and get at work in time! Mona was there, she was looking for you. I don’t understand. He could leave the house to the girl. If she was not there old man would have lived all in trash. Mona went there every other day. The rich guy is to blame. They say it’s his relative. A relative? Shit not a relative. Just imagine, he even did not get in time for the funeral. Did not have a funeral meal. And now he’s messing with the girl. They aren't ashamed at all. Walking hand in hand. But she was Henks... Henks... What can Henks do about it? He has neither money, nor car, he’s just slaughtering pigs and he always will. You got what you deserved. Boss wants to see you. I don’t care. Did you forget anything? I wanted to say I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have behaved like that. In the park... That’s fine. Maybe we could strike a bargain... If I looked after your house? And you’re returning to Riga anyway, right? For the only job here is at the slaughterhouse. I don’t want to work there... You can take it for a deal. And I’m not returning to Riga yet. Butcher, how long are you going to mess about? Shall I tell you a joke? A butcher retires after 30 years of working. Pension is too small, he finds a job at the maternity hospital, becomes a sanitary worker. First birth. Nurse gives him the child and says: ”Clean him, weigh him, all as required.” He takes the child goes away and returns in a while and says: "3 kilos 200 grams without bones!” Idiot! Don’t tear them! I saw them already... These are very good pictures. So what? Yes! He took art photos... He said it is beautiful, and I liked it too. But why are you tearing them now if you liked it? Actually, I wonder what a human feels like when you are photographed naked? Witch! Whiskey! Is that the only one? Then vodka. No, that one. There’s the same moonshine in that bottle. Don’t you know it? You don’t fucking know. You’re wasting your money for nothing. One more. One more. Hey, come on, join me! Fuck off! Hi! Has Henk been here? He has. He mended the door. Our work is perfect. We have even a slogan. We recycle all except for the pig’s squeal. What? We recycle all except for the pig’s squeal. Great advertising text! We process everything except for the squeal! I invented it myself. Let's have a drink! I do not drink with murderers! Am I a murderer? Son of a bitch! I’m working... Janka, to the bar... the bar... I'm working so others can gobble! Knock it off! Get up! Looking for a cow again? Let’s go. Me? Where to? Let’s go. Don’t resist! Let’s go... let’s go if you want it... Wait... There’s something I have to... What do you think... this... Mona... Did Mona Lisa ate meat? Let’s go! You don’t know... nobody knows... Like driving on the sky... Damn! Where are we going? You’ll see. Do you want a bribe? I do. Then take me home. Do you know what karma is? No! Sure you don’t... Take me home! How much would you like? None. You said you wanted a bribe! No money. What then? Give me the red dress. You don’t have a wife, do you? I have, only far away. My wife is here. Do you think I’m an idiot? Yes! No! If you have money you can buy any dress you like! Money is a bribe. But no one will believe about the dress. What if it doesn’t suit her? I’ll give it back to you. What’s that?! What now? What now? Go home. Give me your hand! Oh! A hedgehog in a fog... You... I’m sorry, miss! I’m a guy from the city. I thought there are still some places in country where one can pee peacefully... Well okay... Here we are, aren’t we? And how are you now? Fine? No... I did not mean to... Ah! You didn’t mean! That was cruel! Cru-el! You mean that... - That was... interesting. - Interesting... That camera has no film! Besides, it was you, who wanted to know what it feels like to be photographed naked. In fact I never photographed you! Who would have thought? You were so silent, so silent all the time and now... Can’t shut your mouth! My mouth? I wonder how? That’s how! What are you... And also like this! Mm... damn... What happened to you? Mona! Stay here and don’t go anywhere. Mona, you don’t known how dependent and weak a person can be! A moment! A moment, Mona! Mona! Mona!! Yes, Maruta. What should be photographed? The house? Broker shouldn't come here, I’m not selling anything. What else? Bankruptcy? Maruta, cut it off. Loss of one client isn’t a bankruptcy. I will call him personally. Good morning, Mona! I knew you’re here. I have to talk to you. It’s not a corridor conversation. You’re dressed, let me in! She’s asleep. That’s good. She won’t hear. You see Mona. I... It didn’t happen suddenly. I've been thinking about it for a long time. And now when Henk isn’t between us anymore. What? You didn't know? Everyone knows except for you! Oh God! Now I have to tell... But you will think I am doing it on purpose. You see, Henks left you. And left you squalidly. I told him but he... What are you talking about?! About Henks and that slut leva. I told him he couldn’t go to your flat, but no, you know what Henks is like when he gets drunk. He cannot stop drinking. I can. I won’t be drinking anymore. I’ll try at least. Wait, don’t break me off, Mona! Now you are alone. You won’t survive alone in this town, that would be a horrible life. It’s for you. Mona, I want to marry you! Don’t say “no”! I won’t leave you alone! Try them on Dzintra! What? I need some dough for vodka. Get lost. - Why are you so rude? Damn you, no money again? No, look! A couple of satins! You dropped something. Show me that! She’s mine! Don‘t you dare! Show me! Scrooge, I wish you were dead! A man without a car is like a hedgehog in the fog... I have to go to Riga for a few days. But I can’t go anywhere now. Is he Russian? No, he is a poet. Is that one also a poet? No, he's a butcher. According to laws of karma... The ones who kill animals turn into animals themselves. And the killed animals inhabit bodies to slaughter their killers. And what do those turn into who fuck the animal killers at the slaughterhouse? Are you hot? Give my key back. Don’t come! Throw it! I had a nightmare... Let’s not mourn the untimely death of Henk. As Our Lord is the one, who sets the time for each of us. Let’s comfort ourselves with belief in eternal life in the Kingdom of God. Where have you been? He was found in the slaughterhouse... in the scraping machine... Where? Where? Scraping machine... some say he's in pieces, some say he isn’t... Pity it’s closed... I wanted to take a look... The whole thing is fishy... As if his own fault, as if not... The inheritor has been seen at the slaughterhouse at that time. I will wait by the car. Let’s take the flowers and accompany the deceased to the resting place of his ashes. Give it back, it’s mine! Hush, are you crazy - at a moment like this! This one is yours! You should be ashamed. What's new? Damn it! No one can do anything without me. Ok, Maruta. I will be there. Everything is fine with tires. That’s all. I must go to the funeral meal... Get in! We have to talk. Don’t you see... Henk... Bugger Henk! Why are you avoiding me? You vanish for three days, now you wouldn’t talk to me! My head is full of stuff already, I have to go to Riga otherwise, my company will go bust. Mona, what have I done to you? If I am to blame for something, tell me! Not you. - Then who? I myself... - Mona... We have to go, Mona. - Mona, wait! - No more waiting. Roast is getting cold! Hi. Did you catch the cow? There are suspicions about cows. And you too. Go to Riga! They have seen you by the slaughterhouse. Tomorrow I’m interrogating the lady officially. Then I will have to lock you up. I can do it for three days. Me? Why? On suspicion of alleged murder. Murder?! What rubbish! Who of us is stupid - me or you? I’m not stupid, I’m just stammering! Go away! I don’t believe you are capable of that, but that is my duty. You will not have a life here anyway. Everyone will be pointing fingers at you! It’s country... Hey, but what about the dress? Mona, dear... You can’t do anything there. Don’t be sad. The grave awaits everyone. Shut up, Arkady. I only want what is best... One must know how to handle the grief. I'm grieving too but no can see it. My aunt has died. She lived beyond Urals. I am sorry, I didn’t know. I didn’t know it either. The letter came yesterday. I don’t understand how it reached me. I went to church yesterday... Lit a candle. One of those you gave me, I had no others. I have no aunt any more. I was sacked from the slaughterhouse. Should I be sad? Not me... I found a job in a farm already. Were you sacked? Didn’t you know? Yes, Because of the cows. But you see, Henk was a true friend... Mona... Let’s go... - I’ll come tomorrow. - No, you didn’t get me. Come with me to Riga. Forever... and now. To Riga?! What will I do there? It doesn’t matter. We’ll think of something. Get in. What do you mean - it doesn’t matter? You don’t understand! It's very important for me! No, you don’t understand! How can you! Today of all days! When else?! Besides, the situation is totally idiotic... That policeman... Get in! Death is not an idiotic situation! Leave me alone and go to your Riga! What are you staring at? Your eyes will drop out! Yes, Maruta, I am already coming. I’m getting in the car. Find me a decent lawyer. And I need a broker too. Boss, sorry... The broker called to ask what you have decided. He says he can't have it like that - one day you want to sell it. The other one - not. Let him wait. If he can’t wait, he can go to hell. Colleagues... You will leave anyway. For a moment. Just a flash and I’ll be back. And then another flash... and yet again... Sunday driver... No, I will stay for ever. You are lying to yourself. It is like the dreams, you know... Each of us have our own dreams but when we wake up it’s all gone... ...for both of us. - Why do you have to wake up? Come! Go away. It is easier to say good-bye in summer. Go away, grasshopper... Spouse. I paid the priest. Mona dear, what’s now? Don’t just stand there, Lona is waiting, you know that he got the car only for an hour! Lona, what’s wrong with you? Close the bloody door! My birdie will get frozen! No animal has been killed or injured for the purposes of filming. Filming in the slaughterhouse has been only done during the actual meat production process.
