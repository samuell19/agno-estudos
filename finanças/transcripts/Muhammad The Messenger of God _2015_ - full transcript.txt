In the Name of Allah What you are about to watch in this movie is based upon authentic historical narrations as well as a portrait of my self-perception as well as a portrait of my selfperception of the personality of the great Prophet of Islam, Muhammad (p). The director: Majid Majidi Makkah, 10th year after the beginning of the prophetic mission. Supporting those who have been banned is considered as a disregard to the treaty of the Quraysh. All residents of Makkah, regardless of their status, must adhere to it. Else, the sign of treachery will be stamped on the hands of these men, so that others can take heed. There is no compassion in you Abdul Uzza. This is what you have inherited. Assistance to the dwellers of the valley is against the treaty and this is its punishment. This treaty stinks of murder. This is treachery towards your own family! He is under my protection, Abu Lahab! If anyone draws his sword, then he will face my sword! Is this my cousin Hamzah who is passing through the city in a mask and is being so brazen?! I was just protecting myself from the dust. I speak to my enemies face to face. Are you calling me an enemy? Say what you have to say. I do not see anyone who is willing to listen to me. I am the eyes and ears of Makkah! Hamzah! Speak! I only want well for Bani Hashim. Your goodness is your vice Abu Sufyan. Don't deviate, Hamzah! I only signed the order to exile Muhammad and his followers because I believed that he would have created unrest in this city with his denial of the gods. Untie him! Makkah has no place for traitors. Whoever has been given your protection can no longer stay here. Samuel, you must leave this city before sunset tomorrow. Throughout the first seven years of Holy Prophet's mission, the polytheists of Makkah were not satisfied with only torture and torment, but rather were intent to kill the Holy Prophet. It was the reason why Muhammad and his followers left Makkah to seek refuge in the Valley of Abu Talib which was located between two mountains near Makkah. The polytheists had also sealed off the entrance to the valley to ensure, that according to the signed order, no food or supplies enter and no interaction with the residents of Makkah occurs. We Muslims would stay in this dry gorge for three years under the severest of difficulties and amidst the cries of starving children. The Holy Prophet has said taht the birth of a daugther opens a door of paradise for you. Congratulations! He has named your daughter Aminah, the name of his mother. Aminah. Aminah. He gave these dates as a blessing and said that it will increase the mother's milk. Where did you go? Five days of unfruitful travelling, searching for a grain of barley, searching for a tribe of Bedouins who would take my money. News of the boycott has reached the furthest tribes. Don't worry; their own messengers have unintentionally delivered the call of Allah's religion far and wide. The Holy Prophet just recited something into the ears of the newborn. My heart has been enlightened. All will be resolved soon. Makkah's leaders did not imagine that Muhammad and his followers would be able to withstand and bear such hardships. Determination showned by the Muslims during this time exposed the rifts that existed within the leaders of Makkah. Abu Talib. The leaders of ten tribes have gathered at Dar al-Nadwa. They are waiting for you. Watch over the Holy Prophet's house. Ali, my dear son, is the distribution completed? Do not leave the Holy Prophet alone, stay at his side. Certainly dear father. Where is the opposotion if we all wish to end the boycott? I am the most concerned about my family members in Bani Hashim. Makkah will welcome Muhammad, if this is what the elders want. We will close our eyes to the visible gods and attach our hearts to an invisible one. You tell me Aas, are you ready to share your table with your slaves? And you Hisham. are you willing to allow your wife, with the permission of the God of Muhammad, to speak over you? You want to shut down the brothels and bars to the traders? Then you should all deny your fathers! We should just destroy all the gods of the pilgrims and sit quietly hoping that a caravan comes this way. If it is the benefit of the elders, then why would not I be with you? Welcome O elder of Quraysh! Makkah has been counting the days until it would see you again in its company. The elders still recognize you as the head of the sitting. Welcome Abu Talib! Time is short and there is a lot to get through. I will give you a summary of what was said. Makkah is growing bigger everyday, but its reputation is degrading. Up until a few years ago, this city had great traders such as Khadijah. Do you know what status Muhammad could have today? Not higher than what he already has... God's chosen one. Abu Talib, the income of Hajj has greatly increased this year. I wanted to leave the gathering as I have a secret that can only be mentioned to you. My heart has accepted the invitation of Muhammad, however I want to know how much is he willing to pay in order for Abu Sufyan to join his religion? Belief is not a commodity of sale Abu Sufyan. He is the God's chosen one and I will also be his follower. Together we will come to an agreement. There is no better fragrance than the hand of the one who pledges allegiance? It is possible that his heart may become filled with belief, but do not bring the world of these people into disarray! Abu Talib, do these people not have a god? Don't they have rituals? Do not say no! It is sufficient for Muhammad to keep his God in his heart and become a partner in the wealth and honor of this city. The same goes for you Abu Talib, with your name, jus like before, you can make the large caravans of the city prosperous. No, you yourself are well aware that showing the wealth of Makkah is useless. Unveil the other stories that you are hiding, Ibn Hamd. Other stories?! Come with me. Tolerance of this tribe has ended. All are united on one opinion. What follows is out of my hands. War between tribes?! They're the ones putting themselves in danger. blood (life) is priceless. I have never stepped in blood nor gotten blood on my clothes unless someone else put it first. Abu Talib, if Muhammad refuses to stop his claims, Bani Hashim will remove their support from him. Then no sword will be able to save you. Then will you confront me and an unsupported person who is the Prophet of God? When the drums of war are heard, Bani Hashim will have no place to hide. You have until sunrise tomorrow. In the Name of Allah, the All-beneficent, the All-merciful. All praise belong to Allah, Lord of the Worlds. The All-beneficent, the All-merciful. Master of the Day of Judgment. You alone do we worship and to You alone do we turn for help. Guide us on the straight path, the path of those who You have blessed, not of those who have incurred Your wrath, nor those who are astray. In the Name od Allah, The All-beneficent, the All-merciful. Have you [O Muhammad] not regarded how your Lord dealt with the Men of the Elephant? Did he not make their stratagems go awry? And send against them flocks of birds. O prophet Have you not regarded how your Lord dealt with the Men of the Elephant? Did he not make their stratagems go awry? And send against them flocks of birds pelting them with stones of shale. Thus making them like chewed-up straw? Come this way! Come this way! Hurry! It's mine. Let it go! Go this way! Hurry! Where is Suwaybah? Go! Suwaybah! Suwaybah! Suwaybah! What do I say to Abdul Muttalib? Tell him that I am staying. I will return. Do you see? At the peak of chaos your presence gives me tranquility. When I felt you existence for the first time, your warmth eased the pain of not knowing what happened to your father on that ill-fated journey. Abu Talib! Abu Talib! Abu Talib! Where is Aminah? She did not want to come, what should I do? Is'nt the mountain path riskier for a pregnant woman? She's my brother's legacy. Do not leave her alone! Go! Go! Abu Talib! Abu Talib! Come with me! Follow me! What are you doing in the city? How did you get hurt? The Army of Elephants has taken all of father's camels. The elsers of the tribes are also lamenting and requesting our protection. They are that close? They have set up camp at Muqammis. Abu Dayr and I were there, the rest were taken captive. Where is father? I will return shortly. Father, resistence is impossible. Only a few soldiers remain. Only a handful from all the tribes. Udayd also brought news of your herd of camels. Abraha's army looted them as spoils of war. What about Aminah? She wishes to stay. I have entrusted her to Fatima. Tend to all those whose refuge is the Ka'bah and who are staying here. And also assist all those who are leaving the city. Also find someone who knows Amharic. I am Abdul Muttalib, the elder of Makkah. He is Abdul Muttalib. The elder of Makkah. Come in! You are the elder of Makkah and the gatekeeper of the Ka'bah. During the last two days of my travels, the elders of the every city have groveled at my feet. Some of them requested kindness while others did not. I killed some of them and destroyed their gods, I spared others along with their gods. However, the destruction of the Ka'bah ha been my target since the beginning. I have come to hear the requests of the leader of Makkah and to see what the gatekeeper of the Ka'bah has brought. Now is the time for requests, as once fighting starts, there won't be any opportunity. This is my request. Your army has been taken my 90 camels as spoils of war. Without war, there are no spoils. So tell them to release my camels along with their riders. Without war, there can be no victory? You have lost my respect elder of Makkah. Your request from the general of the army of elephants is the return of your camels and not the safety of your city or the house of your God? Why would my Lord need my intercession? I am only the owner of my camels. This city and gods 'huose has its own owner. I, Abraha, the governor of Yemen, have built a temple in Ethiopia, upon my king's order. It shines as bright as the sun. With the gold from its walls, I can purchase Makkah and all its inhabitants. Answer me gatekeeper of the Ka'bah. Then why is the prosperity of the Marketplace, religion and popularity of the Ka'bah keeps flourishing? What is the secret behind the Ka'bah? I do not know its secret. But I do know that it is all made of stones and not gems. It was not built by a governor as orfered by a king. He said that this visit is over, prepare to defend yourselves. Return the camels and their riders! Get away from my army! These camels are entrusted to you until tomorrow morning. Lord! This house is Your house and we are all residents within Your sanctuary. God's will was such that the elephants did not enter the sanctuary of Makkah and did not go towards the Ka'bah. Light! the light in the sky! The light! Look! Light! Light! Look! Light! Stay still! Keep quiet! Keep quiet! Keep quiet! Silence! Keep quiet! Keep quiet! And this is the blessing wherewith Moses, the man of God, blessed the children of Israel before his death. And he said, The Lord came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints; from his right hand went a fiery law for them. Yes, he loved the people; all his saints are in thy hand: and they sat down at thy feet; every one shall receive of thy words. Moses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob. (Deuteronomy 33/1-4) Nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son od man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven. (Matthew 26/64) It has been realized. Make sure you give food to everyone; no one must leave this gathering hungry. Welcome dear brother! What is happening? A banquet for relatives and elders? You still don't know our father? I know I should have to sit at a table to eat the leftovers of the poor. I am ready to give up all honors, but I will never disgrace myself. Why are you late? The little one is hungry. My lady did not allow me to come. He is very hungry. I saw the banquet that your father has prepared outside Makkah. It's a celebration for his grandson, aren't you pleased? Taking pride in a baby who has no father and a mother who has no milk; they are now using my slave-girl as his wet nurse. I told you to ignore this banquet! I did not go to it. You went and returned with shame. You said that pride must be purchased, so I went to get my share. How did he look? Did he look like Abdullah? I did not see him. Did they not say whom he resembled from amongst the family? I did not meet anyone. This is your portion from the sale! Honor is the share of Abullah's orphan and his other eight uncles. Give birth to a child, then you can also claim a share. From you, I have only carried hatred! Is it? Am I your issue? Or not? Was it that Abdullah didn't look at you and your luck felt on my empty heart? My anguish is that I was the peacemaker who reconciliated the Bani Hashim to the Bani Umayyah; from the ten sons of Abdul Muttalib my share was neither the goods of the family nor its bravery. If you are the peacemaker, the world does not see peace between the Bani Hashim and the Bani Umayyah. I curse you! Examine them all, they must have no flaws. Examine them from head to toe, even the smallest of scars will cancel the transaction. Put the strong ones aside. Where is this one from? Is he able to work? This one is not for sale. Did something happen in Makkah? It's a normal day in the month of Rabi' al-Awwal. I will return. Where are you going? My order? We only saw a light in the sky. Did God not speak to Moses throughout fire? There is a huge difference between that fire and this light. The Mount of Sinai from which Moses came down from is unknown and so is the land of Paran. God and His savior are hidden from us. Was the land of Paran not the place where the other children of Abraham took up residence? Was not the glad tidings of the manifestation of his light the reason why the Children of Israel migrated to this land in the first place, so that one day the promised one can rise from amongst us? Without doubt a chil was born to these people and that soul of the promised one that existed from the beginning of creation descended into its human form. And he is now amongst us. So we know something, but we will not do anything to check it? We should first investigage on whom from amongst the Jews gave birth to a son. The Jews in Makkah are very few. Samuel, the time of arrival of the promised one has not been specified. We will wait and see what the scholars of Khaybar have to say about this. If he is amongst us, we must enthusiastically adhere to his call. We will go to Khaybar in the next few days. But we first need to gather information about the births of this nation that occurred in Makkah. "Atsa" "Atsa" "Haba" "Haba" Is it possible for a prophet to come from this nation? Not from this nation, rather for this nation. Let's go! We will not get our answers here. The grandson of Abdul Mutta?ib from the tribe of Bani Hashim. On that day, everyone named their children with the names of the idols of their tribes. However, Abdul Muttalib went towards the Black stone and sought blessings from the heavenly stone, which was a remnant of Abraham's time. Muhammad Muhammad? Muhammad! What name is this?! We have not heard it before! Where did this name come from? There are no blessing from our gods nor any trace of our ancestors in this name. What is this name! There is no mention of the gods in this name. We have never heard this name from any tribe. No boy was ever named Muhammad. His name is "the praised", praise be upon him! His name is "the praised", praise be upon him! Muhammad! Muhammad! His name is Muhammad! Blessing in that name! His name is Muhammad! Blessing in that name! What do I have? Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Suwaybah! Jameelah is requesting her slave-girl back. But she just got here. Suwaybah! Feeding a newborn does not take long. She left her domestic work to come and feed a child! This child is your nephew. Jameelah is also my wife. Give us some time; the mother has insufficient milk. Life is short, let's stop this game! Where is Suwaybah that she can't hear me? Suwaybah! Aminah, Jameelah is unhappy with her slave-girl feeding your child. Go. but he is still hungry. I do not want words of unhappiness in this house. Why don't you cry? What are you doing? Are you crazy! Do you want to die? Wait! We need water. We were left behind and are thirsty. A little further up there is water. I lost my mule. And the sun has sapped all our energy. We are in a hurry. Wait! Please! Just a drop so that we can get to a well. Just a drop! Come this way and see our condition for yourselves. Lead the way! Come. Where are you going? To Makkah. We are going so that we can share the milk of this child with another. In exchange for some bread to feed my family. You have come late. The naming ceremonies are over. You will miss the wet-nurse market. Take this. In this desert, you should have thought about carrying a few more water bags. You are very kind sir. Father! Clear the room I want a word with you! He doesn't understand our language. Do you understand our language? Your nephew is getting weaker and until we find another wet-nurse he will perish from hunger. Your slave-girl has milk and you are withholding it? Take a fee for the milk or set a price and sell her. I have given the slave-girl as a gift to my wife. A gift cannot be taken back nor be sold. Your wife... Father, Jameelah is your daughter in-law. Do not speak ill of her as she is part of your family. I am not complaining about my daughter in law, But I am complaining about and embarrassed by my own flesh. Bani Umayyah have purchased you with this woman. Or not! Rather you have yourself sold your family lineage to them. If it were not for you this union would not have taken place. Why?! Do Bani Umayyah have some sort of status? What have I gained from my own family? ?Even Cain was not as jealous and hateful as you are to your brother Abu Lahab! The High Priest already aware of the sightings. He also knows about your astonished state and that you took the news of the light rain of Paran to Madaris. He took those signs to be the begining of a new dawn. After such a lengthy period of waiting, what a great blessing has occurred in our era. The truth will be shortly revealed to us. I am worried. Worried?! The signs of the birth occurred but not the signs of the Savior. It points towards Makkah where the Jews are an extreme minority. During the light rain, no male child was born into Jewish family. While awaiting of the Savior continues, rumors of his arrival will also prevail. We should nor await another disciple who will again split this great nation into factions. For years we have been awaiting from generation to generation, what will this all mean if the Savior is from amongst the Arabs? The arrival of the Savior does not have any condition nor stipulation from God. What if he is not from our nation? We do not need you to confirm the apparition of the Savior, you are just an employee. It is our duty to find him. On the one hand I have doubt, but on the other I have certainty. Is this not the order of the Pharaoh reported by the believers of Moses? He must be recognized, as this is the order of the Book. For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder. And his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. (Isaiah 9/6) Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this. (Isaiah 9/7) What if he is not from our nation? How is it possible that a prophet be truthful if the is not from us? Do you doubt the chosen nature of your nation? Go to Makkah and start a business. As you are convinced in the light rain of Paran, search out the child who has the sign of governance on his shoulder, a sign that other prophets also possessed. The Arabs do not believe in a promised savior. If I find that magnificent soul of which the signs speak about... That child is like a treasure, a treasure that could end all our suffering. Go and find him. I am going that way. Harith, no one hired me to be their wet-nurse. I only got this from the wool of the sheep that we brought. What should we do? I don't know. This Jameel does not have the energy to return. Be satisfied. I will take him to the market and hopefully we can get some money from him. They will not pay for it. It will only create more annoyance for our daughter. We don't have any other choise Haleemah. Come. My madam is very difficult to please. However, whoever is chosen will be paid well. Both of you come with me. Don't needlessly walk him around the town. This chunk of meat he has will burn off. His body has scars but I will buy it for the price of its meat. I will not charge you for the slaughtering and you can have the skin. How many dinars? Try and make your madam pick me. My child has no one and is need of food. Catch him! Jameel! Watch out! Where are you going? Jameel! Wactch out! Wactch out! Jameel! Jameel! Wactch out! Jameel! Catch him! Jameel! Jameel! Catch him! Jameel! Watch out! Come back here! Jameel! Watch out! Watch out! Watch out! Jameel! Watch out! Catch him! Jameel! Jameel! Jameel! Jameel! Jameel! Jameel! Jameel! Get up! Get up! Come out from there! Jameel! Jameel! Get up! Get up! Get up! Get up. He is scared. Let him calm down. Will you not eat with me? I had the feeling that I would be receiving guests today. Do not worry! The others will come and take care of him. Welcome. Come inside. Welcome. Please sit. Put your baby down over there and rest for a while. Go! Go! He is hungry. I do not have milk. He has rejected all the wet-nurses that have come during the last few days. My tears are of maternal affection; for that milk that he accepted. Why are you crying? This breast of mine did not produce, but as soon as he started to suckle on it, it became full. What is your name? Halima. Halima Sa'diyad? From its sound you can tell it is pure gold? It will be the property of the one who finds the child. A child who will be known by his blessings. He has a sign on his shoulder, on the back. Because of the heat, this city has a very dry climate, mothers usually send their children to wet-nurses living near the city or to the desert. Search in the city and its surroundings. Go! Go! Go! Go! Quickly! Quickly! I know it is not easy to let Muhammad go. I'm having a hard time separating from him. Is it not possible for the wet-nurse to stay here instead of sending him? She has a husband and other children, how can she stay? If only you gave me permission to go with them. It is of the best interest of you and of Muhammad that he goes alone. Why are you worried? This is our good fortune. I know this family well. We will visit him whenever we get the opportunity. A two months old Muhammad began his first journey. How surreal it was for us, but for Aminah it was unbearable and a source of great grief. Open the door! To protedt you children from devil and from evil spirits! Open! Mother! Let me see him! What is his name? Welcome back! It was a difficult journey. What is his name, mother? Muhammad Unload the camels! Hurry. Sweetheart, did yo see? Do not open your eyes. Muhammad Muhammad Muhammad Come! Come! Get out! Get out! Move away! Remain clean and burn all your clothes. Burn all the grains that were harvested duranting the previous years. Do not allow the animals to drink from the wells located in the center of the city. Bring water for them from the wells that are outside of the city. The city's businessmen must open up their storerooms and generously distribute their cloth amongst the people. What should I do now? See if you can get some wheat from Ta'if. If you see an infected person, separate him from the people. See if you can acquire a few camels and horses for me. I have brought wheat and clothes, with no necessary recompense. Food and clothing! They are worth more than pure gold during these days. How can we compensate you? There is no need for compensation when you distribute what you have equally between the Jews and yourselves. It is the renowned fairness of the gatekeeper of Abraham's Ka'bah that motivated me to do this. There is no difference between us. The Jews are residents of this city and are our brothers. It is the right of the neighbor. Our destinies are intertwined. This is a gift to honor your worthy intentions. For the children of this city and to that child who was born on the night when the stars were raining from the sky of Paran... the one whose name you know. I do not know anything. Tell me the price of your goods and take the money for it. You know. Please begin. Muhammad must return to Sa'diyah tommorrow. He is not the only one leaving. All the children must leave Makkah. Please begin. Do you know how much I love Muhammad? I have spent my whole life in separation. Separation from my previous love Abdullah and my future love Muhammad. So now that the mothers are going with their children, let me go with Muhammad. Love requires the ability to bear difficulties. Because you love him, let him remain unknown. This child has brought so much blessing to all, but where is his own share? Only distance and separation? It's a mystery of love, without doubt someone else loves him more than you and I. Muhammad! Muhammad! Muhammad! Go away! Get lost! Which one is he? The one wearing white. What do you want? We were left behind. Just some bread and water if you have. Shaymah, bring them some water. What do you want with that child? To be healed! My tent is not too far away. Have your water and bread and leave. My husband is sick; let him come with me for a little while so that he can cure him. I said leave! Whatever amount of money you want I will give you, just let us get cured... I will end your days if you utter another word! Leave! Quickly! They are coming. Move! Hurry! Inform your father. Zayd come quick! Hey! Help me! I have been stabbed. Zayd! What happened? Zayd! I am taking Muhammad to Makkah. Get him ready. We will leave before sunrise. My dear Muhammad, this is your travel bag. Give it to your father. As I said, I was very careful. I never left him alone. Halima did not permit any women into the house. No one should know that he has returned. Tell them to get ready. I will take him myself to a safe place. What about Aminah? Inform her once that I am gone. Prepare something for Harith, I will return quickly. Muhammad Muhammad Muhammad! Muhammad! Muhammad! My dear Muhammad, welcome to the cave of Hira, with all its great solitude, purity and tranquility. Air has such a beautiful smell up here! You came up very quickly, I was worried that I might have lost you, but it seems that you know the paths here better than me. I am missing my mother. When will she come? We have come here to wait for her, so that we can take a journey. A journey? A journey to visit family. Muhammad The love and affection between a mother and her child, who had been separated for many years, found an opportunity to manifest itself on a journey to visit relatives in Yathrib. A villager brought that child to Makkah with haste last night. Do you know his name? Muhammad Muhammad Muhammad The spring has dried up. The spring is dry. We will camp here. Keep your allocated portions of water. Keep the allocation of the animals for them. Do they seek water from these idols? In this dry land, God gifed the children of Abraham water. He then commanded him to build the Ka'bah from stone and to establish the religion of monotheism. The people of this land instead of worshipping the one true God only saw the Ka'bah. They took stones of the Ka'bah with them so that they could worship it as they pleased. This is how they forgot the God of Abraham and his religion. And that is why the water stopped flowing. They have arrived. My beloved Aminah! I cannot show enough gratitude, after so many years, I finally get to see you again. Distance and your lack was an excuse to come to visit you. Yours eyes are a reminder of Abdullah, dear Muhammad! Welcome Aminah. It's so good to see you. Welcome. Go inside. Children, Muhammad is your guest, so take good care of him. Abdullah, I have brought Muhammad to you. Muhammad come here. Come here Muhammad. Your father is resting here. When I was a child, I wished to touch the sky, but I couldn't. I wanted to pluck the fruit that was on the highest branch of the tree, as then I would be closer to the sky. Just like that apple. The first time I saw your father, he was like a ripe fruit located on the highest branch of a tree that no one could reach. He was handsome, noble, chaste, with a radiant face. God accepted Aminah's plea and made Abdullah part of her destiny. Even though this union only lasted two months, it was like a sweet and peaceful dream. Mother, I have brought an apple for you. Quicker! Open your eyes wider my dear. Muhammad! Muhammad! Muhammad! Muhammad! Muhammad! Muhammad. The difficulty of the journey is not good for you health. I am feeling better, I can manage the journey. I have to deliver Abdullah's trust. I will not insist more. I will pray for you. My dear Muhammad, know that this also your home. I will miss this city. We will also miss you. Have a safe journey. Move out! Get going! Get going! I need to know what is happening with Muhammad and Aminah. I dreamt that I was extremely thirsty, but instead of my dried lips, I saw myself plunging the lifeless body of Muhammad into water. I do not know its inyerpretation. Water?! I cannot think of an answer. It has made me restless. Its interpretation is your going, go now. Welcome O son of Abdul Muttalib! Why all this fear? We thought that you might have been the thugs again. Bandits? They were not thieves. A day ago, they attacked our caravan, but they were not after goods. What were they after? They unvelied that they were searching for a mother and child. Muhammad! Aminah! Where are they? While travelling, Aminah's health deteriorated, so we were constrained to take her to a village called Abwa. Abwa? What did you say to the assailants? We did not tell them about the village. We told them that they returned to Yathrib. Thank you! Let's go! Don't worry. Come. It is raining as if it will never stop. But finally, it came to an end. The stars then came out abundant and entertaining as if they were endless. But on daybreak, their lifespan also comes to an end. One day, this world will come to an end and the only thing that will remain is love and affection. Just like the sweet scent of your hand wich has accompanied you all the way from Yathrib. Sir! Sir! Aminah has passed away! What happened? The daughter in-law of Bani Hashim has left us! Muhammad, Muhammad has fallen ill! Muhammad, What happened to him? He could not handle the separation. Fever of losing his mother. Sir! Muhammad! His body is heating up. His fever is not coming down, Abbas! Protect Muhammad! Samuel. Aminah has passed away! Aminah! Aminah! The daughter in-law of Bani Hashim is no more! The beloved of Bani Hashim has left us! Muhammad I entrust you to the one true God. Muhammad When the Jews were looking for a place to reside in and God gave them glad tidings, did He tell you that this land, in its entirety, belonged to you? And that they were not inhabited before you? We have received dreadful news from Makkah, Samuel! The jewish traders have been banned from carrying out any business. Do you see this as positive for the Jews? Our religion does not see business as an aim to earn personal wealth but rather as a mean to uplift the entire community, and in order for this to happen there needs to be cooperation with other communities. Your egos are dangerous and must be tamed before they destroy the entire community! Your own ego and that of the ones who is feeding it. The one who throwa rocks towards the sky will get them back on his head. Do not wear the name of a God who you don't fear on your clothes! Abu Talib, father. Muhammad The polytheists, to perform the ritual of the Age of Ignorance, circled around the Ka'bah. They had mixed up this ancient practice with polytheism and idolatry. However we, in accordance to the legacy of Abraham and his religion, still perform the Hajj. Labbayk! (I have answered Your call O Allah!) I have answered Your call O Allah! Labbayk! (I have answered Your call O Allah!) I have answered Your call O Allah! Welcome! Nice! I am honored to have one of the great businessmen of Makkah set foot in my tent. A desert dweller with such lavishness? Tell the truth. Where did you find the treasure? Your father does not consider me worthy o residing in Makkah, so I am forced to trade my pearls in the desert. I have no interst in your pearls nor is my father is of my mediation. Khaybar and I know how to recognize pearls. I heard that your father has taken ill. He is sick. He handed over the affairs of pilgrimage to one of his other sons. Hopefully during the next Hajj there will be no hindrance for my business in Makkah. Let us make this meal the first draft of a pact between us and the dignitaries of Quraysh. Accompany me to visit my father. Leave us alone. I will sacrifice ten camels so that you regain your health. My heart has been yearning for the warmth of your hands, even though you have always been distant from me. But you are a father, a father and an elder to all. My heart does not want the warmth of your hands to be withheld from me. Death is not easy for me. My dear Muhammad, go and tell all the relatives to gather here. Do not lose hope. This is just a minor ailment. Do not worry about Muhammad either, he is dear to all of us. Father, father, it is hot milk. Drink it. It will warm up your body. There was a time when milk was denied to this child. Abu Talib Abu Talib take care of this unique child. He has never felt the warmth of a father nor tasted the sweetness of a mother's compassion in his life. Treat him as a part of yourself. Just like your own child. Now, I can rest in peace. Muhammad 50 coins! 150 coins! 400 coins! 450 coins! 450 coins! 500 coins! 500 coins! 500 coins! Sold! 450 coins! 500 coins! Sold! Take her away! Next slave-girl! Suwaybah! Suwaybah! Please do not sell my wife and children! Please do not sell my wife and children! Get out of here! Please do not sell my wife and children! 500 coins! 500 coins! 700 coins! Sold! Bring the next slave-girl! Sir! Please sir! She is Suwaybah, she has served you all her life! A deal is a deal! Bring me what you owe me and then you can have your wife back! Sir I have been very unfortunate. My flock has been struck by disease. Sir! please! I do not recognize any disease or any goat. I only recognize you and this is how you will repay me! Throw him out! Sir! Sir! Please show mercy! Sir! Be patient! Please give me some more time! Peace be upon you dear uncle. Muhammad? You have grown up well. Forgive Suwaybah and her child. He agreed to pay me twice the amount I gave him at a certain time. He gave his wife as a guarantee. Free his wife, he will repay you one day. Him?! How? He has nothing to give! Whike he worked for me, I provided food and shelter for his wife and children. He became greedy and asked for a loan so that he can work for himself. I cannot endorse his misfortune. Give me some time to pay back his debt uncle. If I am unable to do so then I will come and work for you. You? Who will be your guarantor? Abu Talib? Is it not sufficient that he is Muhammad the trustworthy? His guarantor is his truthfulness. Today is a special day. Muhammad finally stepped foot into this house. For once your nephew requested you something. Tell them not to sell her. Why are you waiting? Return his wife. Suwaybah was my slave-girl, the agreement in exchange for her freedom is that we should get to see Muhammad more often. This is a worthy agreement. Do not forget about our agreement. Don't worry. I won't. Noooo! Noooo! Have mercy! Have mercy on me! Help! Noooo! You sent a message saying that this one was a boy, so where is he? I have come from far away just to see your daughter Sawahi? Please leave her alive! She will serve you. You will feed her only for her to become a slave-girl for her husband's family? I will feed her from my own share! Please leave her alive! You are a source of disgrace! The women of our tribe have given birth to sons. So during time of war or when work is needed, they can hold their heads up high. Leave her alive! Please! You didn't gige birth to a boy! You don't deserve to remain alive! Who are you? Is she not your daughter? She looks very much like you. She has beautiful eyes, just like you. If only she had a long life, she could give birth and keep the legacy of your eyes alive. Congratulations to you on having a girl. A daughter is a blessing. Abdul Uzza! Abdul Uzza! What remains in Makkah that your caravan doesn't yet have? The only thing that remains is Muhammad's debt, concerning that mother who he freed. It's a very big caravan, counting it has made me tired. I am not blind. They are taking MUhammad with them. Doesn't matter. The reality is that you should have desired Muhammad from your father and not from your brother at least you would have kept a part of his life. Leave me alone. You cannot stay in your room, wear colourful clothes and claim to be the head of Quraysh! If it is a befitting title, then why is it attached to Abu Talib? Go to Kanis and find Barukh. Tell him it's a message for Samuel. Let's gather to welcome the bell! Let's gather to welcome the bell! Hasten to welcome the bell! When the world will be filled with injustice and religion will be no more, God will show mercy to the people and send a messenger to them who will have a white cloud above his head. He will be your savior. Bring me my robes! Get them away! Move from here! Get out of the way! Strike them with stones! Get the lepers away! Stay away from them! Stay away from them! Do not get close! Go away from here! Get out of the city! Move the lepers! Stay away from them! Are you the head of this Arab caravan? He is asking if you are the head of this Arab caravan. Yes I am. The priest of this church wishes to invite you and your companions for lunch on this blessed day. Accept his invitation dear uncle. This protector of the helpless, is he your son? Muhammad is like a kind son who is living with us. He is my brother's son. Your brother? Yes. This is also a sign. He is alone, while the shade of God is upon him. What do you mean? God Almighty is His words to our master gave glad tidings of another comforter who will come and remain with us. Who is that comforter? He is a person like the Son of man endowed with the spirit of truth. He will bear witness to our master. It is a good news for us. Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannat receive, because it does not see him, nor know him: but you know him; for He abides with you, and will be in you. (John 16/7) But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all the truth; for He will not speak of his own initiative, but whatever He hears, He will speak and He will disclose to you what is to come. (John 16/13) Peace be upon you. Welcome young man! Peace be upon you. Why can they not be treated in a way that you would have like to be treated? The sin is from us. This status has been established so that we may seek forgiveness from people's sins. However, our sin is the neglecting of the destitutes. But your words reflect those of our predecessors. Jesus has said: "Do unto others as you wish other to do unto you." This is another sign young man. That you gave no importance to the majesty of this church, but instead sought out the failures of man and its' trails. Just as God willed. These are the words of Jesus. Just in another form. Our first teaching is: know that your Lord is one. Where do you find God? In the hearts of the downtrodden. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. (Matthew23/39) To this part of the world more than any othaer place many messengers have been sent by God. I have seen clues in this land, of the fallout of a nations' malice a nation that could not tolerate their own prophets. They request a savior via their tongues, but in their hearts there is fear. They have gotten used to the little profit of this world and are afraid that their world will be turned upside down. This all stems from their ignorance. They are afraid that the savior will come and nullify the teaching and books of the previous prophets. They do not know that he has not come to abrogate, but rather to complete and perfect the religion. There are many signs of his appearance. Tell me one of those signs? One of them should be located between his shoulder blades, have you seen it? Yes! Do you know what it means? It is the sign of prophethood. Listen carefully. this path is extremely dangerous. End you journey here. Do not go to Syria. Return to Makkah and take extreme care of him. And anything left in the caravan will be for you. We have to allow them to exit Busra, so that the government soldiers cannot assist them. You said the balancing of your people's debt is the tribe. So what do you want with their property? Only the salvation of the misguided ones from amongst us. Salvation? After twelve years of research we finally have the occasion. And I have only thought about the salvation of my own people. Know that God Almighty said to Moses: "A prophet from amongst them, from amongst your brothers for you will be chosen, so listen to him." He is not from us Samuel! I am worried. You said that only the Arabs are protedting them, not the Roman army. They are very strong and well trained. This will not work. Go and hire some more men. You will get it after the fight. Keep this between us. Send three archers forward and hire some more men for this fight. And if no one comes? Then wait in the mountain pass. Go! You there! Follow the caravan step by step. Let's go! Buhayra's plan to leave us a little later than the main caravan from Deir was well thought out. Didn't you say after the fight? Hmm? A horse alone in the desert? Where did he leave its rider before running away? No horse would leave its rider and run away, unless the rider himself runs away. Samuel?! We will stop here. Tie down the camels. Come here. Come here all of you. Dates! Gives us dates! Dates! Dates! Gives us dates! Dates! Gives us dates! Dates! Gives us dates! Be careful. Slowly, slowly. Gives us dates! Where are your menfolk? At sea? No. He is injured. He does not have the ability to travel. Where can I finf them? Distribute whatever we have among them Just keep enough for us to reach Ghadeer. Jerish! O Great Jerish! Have mercy upon us! Look at our lamentations! Look at our hunger! O Great Jerish! This woman and her children are a sacrifice for your stillness. Please look upon us again! We will throw out our sacrifices into the sea. So open its bounties to us! The wailing of women? The wailing of women! The sacrifice to sea! The sacrifice! The sacrifice! The sacrifice! The sacrifice! The sacrifice to sea! Who do you think you are? Get away! Get away from them! They are the cacrifice to the sea! Get him away! Get him away from there before he makes Juraysh angry! Get him away! Get him away! Get him! Get him! Tie him up! Tie him up! Throw him into the sea! Abbas! Protect Muhammad! Move out of the way! Stay calm! What are you doing? What are you doing? Remain calm! Wait! Dear father, the Holy Prophet is calling you. Muhammad is the prophet of God who has been given the responsibility to deliver to you the message of your Lord loud and clear. The message of God to Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him is this: The pact concerning the boycott of the Muslims is no more, that very pact that was signed by the leaders and heads of Quraysh. Son of Abdul Muttalib! Son of Abdul Muttalib! He was not the one who endorsed the pact that he can to cancel it when it pleases him! The tribes of Quaraysh have elders, leaders. They have gods. Where is the invisible God of Muhammad who has the audacity to stand up against our gods? Leat, Uzza and Hubal! They have brought bounties and security to these people. What has the God of Muhammad brought to his followers except poverty, misery, hunger and death? O sons of Abdul Muttalib! Is this the great revelaton of a man who speaks in the name of God? You have summoned young and old, women and children here in order to claim that the pact of the Quraysh has become invalid?! In front of the general public, tell us where is your proof? Where are those words worth listening? And they have ho proof, so know this, Abu Talib, this pact and boycott will only end when I say it does, when the heads of the Quraysh will want it! If it occurs in any other way, the answer of Makkah to your valley will be war and swords! With which pact have you gained supporters for war and conflict? Why do you not ask your leaders, before you stain your hands with blood, to reveal to you the pact which they wrote and endorsed in secret? Maybe, you honestly do not see these people as your own! God revealed to His messenger that the pact no longer exists! Termites have destroyed the pact. If this is not the case then show it to everyone! This is a clear pact. Behold! Only "In the Name of Allah" remains! God is great! Was it not your gods which were upon the truth? That god who protected the believers is upon truth. Without the pact, which war? Which swords? This is sorcery! Who besides the sorcerers could come to know about a pact that was signed in secret? The magicians also thought that the staff of Moses as witchcraft, they did not believe him. They called him a sorcerer. But he was a messenger from God. Everything except the one true God is insignificant and transitory. O people! Take this as a sign of your invitation towards the truth. Turn towards God, who has no equal and whose name is eternal. I see no pact that needs to be upheld. This is a sign of their victory Abu Sufyan. Do not hesitate any longer, your swords is still sharp. As long as Abu Talib is the one who supports and protects Muhammad, nothing can be done. Muhammad In the Name of Allah; the All-beneficent, the All merciful Say, "O people of the Book! Come to a word common between us and you: that we will worship no one but Allah, and that we will not ascribe any partner to Him, and that we will not take each other as lords besides Allah." But if they turn away, say, "Be witness that we are of those who submit." (Surad Ale Imran (3): 64) There is no compulsion in religion: righteousness has become distinct from error. So one who disavows the Rebels and has faith in Allah has held fast to the firmest handle for which there is no breaking; and Allah is All-hearing, All-knowing. (Surah Baqarah (2): 256) O you who have faith! Be maintainers, as witnesses for the sake of Allah, of justice, and ill feeling for a people should never lead you to be unfair. Be fair; that is nearer to Godwariness, and be wary of Allah. Allah is indeed well aware of what you do. (Surah Maidah (5): 8)
