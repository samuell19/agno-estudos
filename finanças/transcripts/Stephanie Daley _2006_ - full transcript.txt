- Stephanie? - She's bleeding. - Does anyone have a jacket or a blanket? - Is she okay? - My God. - You're okay. - Tamp it. - Her name is Stephanie Daley. - Ma'am, calm down, it's all right. It's all right. - Where is it? Where's the baby? - Mrs. Daley, please. - Stephanie, Stephanie. My baby. We're gonna see her, okay? - Just keep your head down. - Mr. and Mrs. Daley is it true that-- - I don't know. - What are they doing at the house? - Look, just stay in the car, I'll get rid of 'em. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, you need to, you have to get back, you have to get back. This is private property. This is private property, come on. - The police took things. - Where's the door? - The doctor said we should take it off so we can make sure you don't hurt yourself. - There's a kick. - He's always kicking. - Three pounds, 10 ounces, 29 weeks, three days. Not bad, young lady. - Hey. - Hey. - Sorry I'm late. - Look, look. - May I ask why you decided to change doctors? - Well-- - well, you were recommended to us as someone who specialized in high risk pregnancies. - I don't consider you high risk. - Well our previous doctor did not betray a lot of confidence and was always talking about Lydie's age like she had done something wrong. - I have delivered many women older than you. I would say your health is more of a factor at this point. You conceived three, just three months after a stillbirth. That's remarkable. - Well I'm healthy. No, I just, would you admit it if you didn't feel fine? - What's that supposed to mean? - Nothing, nothing. You wanna grab lunch? - I'd love to but I have to stop by the office. I'll see you later. - Jack. - Lydie. Good to see you. You look wonderful, when are you due? - No one asks what I do anymore, just when. - I already know what you do. That's why I'm here. - Come in. - You think Paul's up for diaper duty? - We're gonna find out soon. - Hey, scheduled another competency hearing for next week. They're just aging the case, but what are you gonna do? I had Jacobsen on it, but some kind of conflict. - What about a plea bargain? - There's one on the table, but the parents won't touch it. They wanna clear their little girl. - Medical examiner estimates 26 weeks. I'm at 29 weeks, by the way. - That's not a bad thing. - Is it a good thing? - You're a good thing. - Thank you. - She claims she didn't know she was pregnant. Claims that the infant was stillborn. Used her teeth to cut the cord. - Air in the lungs? - And bowels, also toilet paper embedded in the face. - And the father a marine 19 years old. - Claims he was unaware both that she was a minor and that she was pregnant. Parents, teachers, classmates, all clueless. Thought she was gaining a little weight. - Abdominal muscles at that age are very tight. You think she knew? - That's what I want you to find out. - I'm asking you what you think. - If this is cutting too close to your leave I can call Levenson. - I'll call Levenson. Mr. Daley, Stephanie, Mrs. Daley. I'm Lydie Crane, I'm sorry to keep you waiting. Come on in. So I am a forensic psychologist and as you probably know I have been hired by the prosecutors office to provide an evaluation for the competency hearing next week. And should your case move to trial-- - We're not taking a plea bargain. - Should your case move to trial I would very likely be called as a witness. I also need to tell you that anything you talk to me about in that it may be relevant to the case, could be considered evidence and used against you in court. Do you understand? - We have nothing to hide. - Stephanie? Good news is that I have your test results here, so I won't be asking you to do those again. We'll just be talking. At anytime you like to speak with your parents or talk privately with your lawyer that's fine, okay? Watch out, that's very hot. Take it by the handle, okay? Okay, do you wanna ask any questions? - They hire you 'cause you're pregnant? - Actually, I was hired because I handled a similar case for the prosecutor two years ago. - What happened? - 17 year old buried her infant alive. - I didn't kill it. - I didn't say you did. - I already told the police and the doctors everything. - Well, I'm not the doctors and I'm not the police. - You work for the police. - No, I work for the prosecutor, that's different. Do you understand the difference? I was hired to make an unbiased evaluation. If I don't, your lawyer will take me apart, you can trust me on that. So, why don't we start by you telling me about last summer. - It was just a regular summer. - Steph, let's go. - And I'm gonna go see your mom after church. - Thank you. - Richard. - Hey, Joe, how are ya? - Hi Terry. - And you, Miri? - Hi, Stephanie, how are you sweety? - Looking forward to seeing Steph in AP English this fall. - And drivers ed. And driver's ed, dad. - Not 'til the spring. - You'll have to come over and babysit sometime. - Okay. - You know, when your mother was your age she used to babysit for me. Yeah, yeah, I was nine years old. I had a crush on her the size of Nebraska. - Submission. It's not a very popular subject these days. Look around you. Everything is teaching you how to be a leader, a trendsetter. It occurs to me that all this talk is because we are trying to replace God. Follow God and you're a leader. - You wanna go down? Yeah? There. There, yeah, yeah. No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no. Come on, come on. - No, Ralphie, no, no, no, no, no. - Hey, honey. - Paul. - Why does he do that anyway? He's afraid of that thing. - He just wants the attention. - Now I know you're superstitious about buying stuff, but first of all I thought it would match your Jeep beautifully, and it was on sale. - Well, it's broken? - What do you mean? - Well, here. - What is that, is that an important part? - It's okay, I can exchange it. - Can we sue? - Yeah, we'll sue. We'll sue 'em. We're not suing anyone. - Can't just fire everyone. - I'd fire me too if I were them. I deal with selling things. Every single person in three counties has been reading about this. - C E C F C G C E C. - That sounded good. - I'm just trying. Okay, stop, shh. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. What? - Come on, that's totally cheating. - Hey lard ass. Put 'em on the scale. - Okay. - How much do you weigh? Somebody needs a diet. - Cutest little. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. I wanna wear the white skirt. - What, the one with the-- - The one with the ties on it - Wait, wait, wait, this one's jinxed. - Why? - It just is. - Then you're not wasting your space. - Hey, mom. I'm gonna go sleep over at Rhana's. - Be good. - Are you close with your parents? - Sure. - They talk to you about sex? - No, but my Mom tried to, but I mean I knew everything already, so. - How? - I dunno, TV I guess. - They talk to you about abortion? - No, but I could never do that. - Why not? - Because it would be like killing a baby. - Hold still. - I'm trying, it tickles. - Hello? Yes, Stephanie's here. - That's my mom. - Yeah, the girls are watching a movie. Would you like to talk to Stephanie? No, it's not a problem. Bye. - Your sister's cool. - She wants the house to herself tonight so she and her boyfriend can fuck. It must be weird being an only child. I bet that's why you're so shy. - I am not. I'm not shy. - Around guys you are. - Well, it's just that I haven't' found one that I like yet. - Hey, Steph. That isn't your shirt. - Shut up, Brad. - Jen and Rhana, what's up girl? - How are you? - Good, how are you? My God, Stephanie, you came. - Yeah, hi. - I'm so glad you came. - Hey Rhana, hey Steph. Steph, nice top, you can see a little belly. - Okay. - There's Mickey. Do I look okay? - Duh, go ahead. - Okay, bye. - I really wanna go to school for psychology. - Can I see some ID? - I don't-- - I'm fucking with you, actually. Okay, give me the beer. No, you gotta tip it so you don't get too much head. - No such thing as too much head. - I knew you were gonna say that Jeff, 'cause you're an asshole. What's your name? Shut up. What's your name? - Stephanie Daley. - That's cool. - Hi kitty. Hi. Hey. Hi, look at you. Can I pick you up? My goodness. Come, we'll sit on the floor. Hey. Aw, hi little kitty. Listen to you purr. - Hey. - Hey, hey. What? - You up here all alone? - Yeah, I'm just trying to be by myself. - Yeah, yeah I get that, yeah. Those people downstairs, you know, they're just like a bunch of fuckin' kids. - Yeah. - Yeah, sometimes I feel like I'm like a babysitter sometimes. - So, are you, are you a senior? - No, I just graduated. - So what college are you gonna go to in the fall? There he goes. Is it like really cold in here? Or is it really hot, I can't even tell. I'm sorry I. - No, it's... It's a cat hair. - Yeah, you got some right there. Is that, can I? I'm sorry. Close your eyes. Close your eyes. Just close your eyes. Close 'em. Okay, now this one. Now you have to do me, okay? - Okay. - Okay. - Okay. - Yeah? - I just. - Yeah? Yeah? Yeah? Stephanie? - Yeah. Stephanie? - Yeah. - Corey, let's go! Now! Come on! Corey if you don't open this door I'm coming in Corey. You're my guy. - I didn't cum. - Let's go! - How'd you get home? - Hitched. - Were you scared? - Nothing really ever happens around here. - Well something had just happened to you. - Yeah, but I didn't think that it counted. - Why not? - I didn't think it counted because he didn't cum. - So you didn't tell anybody? Not even Rhana? And when your period was late? - It was always late. I mean, it was never regular and I was on a diet. I heard that could. I heard that could make you lose it for a while. - And Corey? - Never saw him again. - Hello? There she is. My darling. Where's mommy? Is she in here? Here she is, there's my big girl. Hey baby. - Hi, I'll make you something to eat. - I can't stay, a client of Paul is having a party. - But you remember dinner on Thursday? - No, I know you don't want another shower, but we have to celebrate week 29. Here, take this. Put some cheese on it, jalapeno. Right there. - Paul is bringing Frank. - Is Frank still desperate for a wife? - Are you still not interested? - I already have a child. - Did I tell you I'm evaluating Stephanie Daley? - The ski mom? Congratulations. - Thanks, if you mean it. - Jesus Christ you're bleeding in the lasagna sweety. - I'm so sorry. - Don't be sorry. - Wow. - It's okay, it's nothing. - But how could I have not noticed that? - I do not know. - Shit. - Here, hold this up. Lydie, I'm not an expert, but I don't think anyone's ever brought a kid into this world without losing their mind a little. Do you want flowers or a dinosaur? - Dinosaur. - Dinosaur it is. It will be worth it, I promise. - No, cat. No, no you don't. I'm so sorry. - I was getting worried. - I stopped by Jamie's. - I really, really do not wanna go to this thing. - Come on. - Hey, kids, I'm glad you could finally make it. - Roy. - Good to see you, Paul. - How you doing? - This is Sharlene. - Hello, how do you do? - Hi Lydie. - I'd like you to meet my wife, Lydie. - How do you do? Very pleased to meet you. - It's very nice to meet you. - Paul, buy one get one free. I really love what your husband did with this place. Paul, can I see you for a minute? - Yeah. - Excuse us. - Sure. - I really didn't wanna go to this. - Hey. - Hey. So, so, how are ya? - I'm fantastic and I'm 30 pounds overweight, but everyone keeps telling me how great I look. - You look totally hot. - Totally hot. - Totally. - You know that I have varicose veins. - Really? - Real ones. - Can I see 'em? - Yeah, you wanna? - Whoa. Whoa, whoa, do those hurt? - Yeah, they do. - Frank, over here. - Um, I gotta go. - Yeah, go, go, go. - You're Paul's wife? - I am. - Your talented husband must be doing wonderful things with the nursery. - Well, actually we're waiting till after the birth for that. We have some things picked out, but-- - Aw, don't be like that, honey. Don't think cautiously, you must have a ballsy vibe. Otherwise, you're gonna pass on all sorts of things to your child. I know, I know, I'm doing regression myself. - And what exactly do you remember? - Waves of panic, my mother saying that I was destroying her figure and she didn't want me. Her heart beating above me in the dark. - Excuse me. Hey. - Hey. - Seen Paul? - No, but I'm sure he'll come back. - Paul always comes back. - You all right? - Yeah. - Why don't you step into my office? - Thank you. - I heard about the ski mom. - News travels fast. - Are those clip on? - Yeah. - Wow. No holes. - I'm afraid of needles. - I got mine done after my divorce. At the mall. - That's very brave. I wish people would stop smiling at me. - Sorry. Hey, that's one wish. You got two more. - I wish that I didn't have to pee every two minutes. And I wish I could have a drink. - I can get you drunk with my hands. Come on. Give me your hands. Now close your eyes. - What are you gonna do? - Close 'em. Both of them. Don't cheat. Now, visualize a bloody Mary. Limes, olives, celery. Tall, frothy, bloody Mary. - Are you sliding yet? - I am. - You smell like Roy's scotch. - You can smell that? You have a nose of a bloodhound. - Shit. - My Dad took off last night. - You know where he went? - Denver, it's where my uncle lives. He's a hippie and makes flatbread. I don't even know exactly what flatbread is but... My dad told my mom that he needed a change. I don't really blame him, I mean I wouldn't really wanna be around me and my mom either. - Why not? What's wrong with you and your mother? - She thinks this is all gonna go away. That I'm just gonna go back to school and it's gonna be the way that it's gonna be before. - giving me like this random phone call. Steph, hi. My God, she's put on like 20 pounds. - Hi Steph. - Hey. - All right ladies and gentleman. It's that time. How's everybody doing? - Good. - Good. Jacob Brower. - Hey Mr. Thomas. - Satan Carmichael. - It's Satin, Satan has an A at the end. - Sue, Katie, one, two, ready and-- Left, left, left, left. Play from the top. - I cannot stand this class. My God, look at your boobs. Wow. - You're out! - Hey Satan! - Hey lard ass! - You bitch. You were already out! - Ignore her, just ignore her! - Satin used to go to our church when she was little. She was a really good friend of mine. And then she got really weird. And they're like, there were all these rumors about her having sex with different guys. - Did you believe those rumors? - I don't know. Didn't really think about it. It's just, stuff, stuff people were saying. I don't know, it wasn't really real. I think she kinda felt like I dumped her. - Like Corey dumped you? And Rhana? - Rhana didn't really dump me, she just got a boyfriend. - That's awesome. - What are you doing? Stop. Are those diet pills? Aren't there like speed in those? - No, I think they're herbal, my mom gave them to me. - Let me have one. - All right everybody, welcome to ski club. Mr. Jeffrey, welcome, glad you could make it. All right everybody, this year's trip, second weekend in January, mark it down, put it in your calendar. - Come on Steph, are you serious? Would you really wanna be one of those girls? Jeff's into you. - I don't think so. - You know what your problem is? You don't believe in yourself. You have to believe. Believe. - Hey. - Hey. It's a cute uniform. - Yeah. - I like the buttons. - Have you talked to Corey? - Corey, why would I have seen Corey? - I thought you guys were friends. - Well yeah, we hung out sometimes, but you know he's kind of a jerk. You heard he joined the marines, right? He totally shaved his head. Like a peach. Can I see this? Do you wanna thumb wrestle? - Sure, yeah. - All right, let's see this. Pinchers, all right, one-- - One, two, three. - Go, playin' possum? Come on, come and get it. Killer vice grip. So are you going to the ski trip? - Dad? - Steph? It's awfully late, honey. I know you're almost grown up but I do still wash your sweaters. - Lots of kids smoke at parties. - Do you? - No. My mother didn't think that I wanted to ski, she thought I wanted to hang out with my friends. And then she told me about how she used to be a pot head. Look what that did for her. - How did that make you feel? - I knew if I couldn't go, I wouldn't get Jeff. And I'd never break the jinx. - The jinx? - Sounds like really silly but ever since summer, and sometimes it was worse than others but... Sometimes you can predict which way it was gonna go, you know, if you watch for the signs. - What sort of signs? - Well, I mean it could be, could be a fly on the wall. The way somebody looks at you or something that they said. Has that ever happened to you? - Sure. But I know it's just my brain working. You know, playing connect the dots, whichever way it can. - This is Paul, I am unable to take your call right now so leave a message. - Hello? How are ya? - Any dizziness or headache? - No why? Is something wrong? - Well your blood pressure's a little high. It's probably nothing, but I want you stop in here again tomorrow, we don't want to take any chances. - Okay. - Hi. - Hey. Cat box is broke. - Yeah? - I'm not allowed to handle cat feces. - Yeah, I know. I'll take a look at it tomorrow. - We have a birth class tomorrow. More of Roy's scotch? - Well you know, I work with Roy Gilcrest just to drink with Roy Gilcrest. Yeah, I like what we're doing though. It's different, yeah, different than we usually do, you should come have a look. - Yeah. - How did it go with the doctor today? - Fine. - Not what Jane says. - What? - I called. - It's nothing we can do anything about. Something we have to watch. - Yeah, well if you stopped working like you said you would. - I can separate my work from my personal life. - Then what's it doing in bed? - Look if you wanna fix something, can you fix the cat box? - You want me to fix the cat box? - Yes. - All right. - You're gonna do it now? - Yeah, I'll fix the cat box. - The car wasn't starting so I brought it into the garage. Billed me $375 for it I don't know how I'm gonna come up with that. Look the hearing is next week, after that? When are you coming home? Here's Stephanie. - Hey Steph! You're so beautiful. - Is this your husband? - Yeah. - He's cute. Your hair looks different. - Yeah, it's an old photo. I was pregnant last spring. - What happened? - Here come on, sit down. - So, I saw you near the drug store yesterday. - Really, didn't see you. - You were driving over the bridge across the street. - I hate that intersection. So the fact that you saw me yesterday, is that a sign? - What do you mean? - What you were talking about yesterday. - Not really. - No, why not? I mean, what makes a sign. - I don't know, I think it just has to be something specific. - So give me an example. - Well the eggs. - So now that you know what everything is and how to get pregnant, let's talk about how not to get pregnant. Anyone? - Condom? - Sorry, Pratt. I'd love to say you're right, but according to the school board, the only way to be a 100% certain you won't get pregnant is abstinence. That's the only way. To be 100% certain you won't get pregnant. All right, let's move on to parenthood. This is a beeper baby. The beeper says feed me, change my diaper, whatever, you press the button here. Everything's cool, healthy baby. So, all of you in the aisle will get a beeper baby. And everyone else will get a slightly less exciting. Beeper egg. - Fuck off. - You're walking up a hill, we all know about hills here. Your load is heavy. Where is your comfort? Where is your staff? Do you find it in drugs? Or alcohol? Maybe it's your job. Or the internet. - Did you say something to her about us? - These things may seem as if they're going to make your life easier, but what do they really do? - Bull shit you didn't. - At the end of the day, they make our loads heavier. Where do we turn? What do we do? You give it to God. - You didn't say anything? - Say anything to who, what are you talking about, Joe? - What she just put that in her sermon? - You think I'm telling the preacher what to say in the service? The universe does not revolve around you. - Fill it up. Do you have cigarettes here? - Joe no. What's that? - It's just an egg, supposed to show you how to have a baby. - No man for any considerable period can wear one face to himself and another to the multitude, without finally getting bewildered, as to which may be true. Okay, anybody with a baby doll or an egg, do whatever you have to do, but please make them be quiet. Thank you. All right, talking about the Scarlet Letter here. Anybody wanna tell me the point of this book? Stephanie? - I think the point of the book is to show that it's harder to live a lie than it is to tell the truth and be punished. - That's good, Steph, good. Anybody think this story has any relevance today? Satin? - I think it's bullshit. - Okay. Maybe you could be more specific. - He writes about this hypocritical priest guy. Who trashes this woman's life and we're supposed to feel sorry for him because he's ruined his relationship to God. - And you don't think a relationship with God is an important thing? You know what great literature is about, Satin? It's about man and God. Nothing else really matters. - Come here, come here. I'm sorry. - You're not sorry. You're such a fucking sheep. - All right everyone, hello. The moment you've all been waiting for. I'm collecting eggs and babies. Cheryl. Jeff. Stephanie. Stephanie? - Stephanie, where's your egg? - I don't know. - You don't know? What does that mean? Is it hiding? - I lost it. - Stephanie. Did you know you were pregnant? - No. - Stephanie. - No. - Did you think you might be? - I thought it was a test. - A test of what? - I was weak. God knew it. - God knew it? - I was weak. - Negotiating with God is one thing. Blaming God is another. You were the one with a choice, you could have found out. - I thought I was being punished. - Last year, I lost a little girl at 23 weeks. They found out her heart had stopped beating, they induced labor, it took six and half hours to deliver her, she came out looking like her father. What was I being punished for? - You tell me. - And what we need to know is, is this a form of legal insanity or not? - Well once we establish that she the possibility of pregnancy then we can argue that she had not only the responsibility to examine that possibility but also the resources to do so. - You're saying she wasn't in real denial? - No, I'm saying that I don't believe her denial was pathological, I believe it was a choice. - So now that we're all comfortable, let's work on our breathing exercises to help with relaxation. Partners you can do this as well, so let's start with some deep long, deep breaths. Good. - Hey. Paul couldn't make it. - Now we're gonna work on some panting exercises. Let's take a deep breath. - What? - I can't believe he sent you! - I know, I know, it's a client meltdown, you know Paul is the one they trust. - These classes are ridiculous, it's not even, I'm mean we've done them before, but even if we didn't, they're just a way of keeping me busy so you think you're getting ready. - What you're not ready? - Is Paul seeing someone? - I'm sorry, what? - Is that why you're here? - What are you talking about? - I found this in the cat box. - Well. Did you talk to the cat? Okay, I'm kidding, I'm sorry. Did you talk to Paul? - Something's wrong. Like last time. - You mean physically. - No. It's just... It's just a feeling. Like when you know it's gonna rain and you're not sure when. - Do you know something? Last time, wasn't your fault. - Then who's fault was it? - Sometimes things just happen. Look. - Give me a hand? - I'd like to thank God for the position I'm in right now. - Make no down payment, no monthly payment-- - 19 year old Corey White office today. White is accused of statutory rape in connection with the ski mom case. - Private White is doing everything to cooperate investigation. We expect a fair and timely resolution. - Morning Jack. - I wanna talk to you about Corey. - I spoke to the prosecutor's office this morning. Corey said that you went to see him before Christmas. Why did you go and see him, Steph? - You put it on. - You put it on honey. Who's that boy? - He's just a guy. - Hey! - Stephanie? What are you doing? - I heard something outside. I thought it was a deer, I thought it was hurt. - Steph. Steph. Come on. Let's go see if it's still out there. It's gone now. Steph, you're not a little girl anymore. Still it's crazy thinking about you growing up. Taking risks. I hope it's not too late for that ski trip. Don't break your leg or anything. - Come on! - Did you think about getting any help? - No. - No, it didn't occur to you? Or no you didn't want any help? - Both, I already knew she was gonna be dead. - How did you know that? - I just know. - Did you check for a pulse? - Wrapped her up in toilet paper. - And threw her away? - Yes. - But first you had to cut the umbilical cord. Did you hold her while you chewed the cord? Was she still in the leg of your snow pants? - I don't remember. - What did you do with your hands? - I don't know. - Tell me what you believe happened. - What if what I believe turns out not to be true. - Then stop believing it. - I don't remember. - I think we're done here. Did you think about getting any help? - No. - No, it didn't occur to you, or no you didn't want any help? - Both, I already knew she was gonna be dead. - How did you know that? - Just knew. - And then? - And there she was. - So when do the headaches begin? - This morning. - The baby is fine. - He stopped kicking and I thought, I don't know. I don't know what I thought. - Lydie, when you had your miscarriage, did you talk to someone, a grief counselor-- - A stillbirth after 20 weeks it's a stillbirth. Not a miscarriage. - Stillbirth, I'm sorry. - Yeah, sure I talked to someone. - And? - That's not this baby. - What are you so afraid of? For having this baby? - Just afraid of... Being afraid of absolutely everything. - Sweetie, Jane, reminder about dinner tonight. Be here, be hungry. - Do you have piercings? - Yeah. - Does it hurt? - Just for a second. - Yeah. - You missed a great dinner. - Was Jane furious? - Yeah. And she sent some leftovers. You pierced your ears. - Just one. - It's nice. What? - It was in the bathroom, you tell me. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Are you sleeping with someone else? - No. - Don't know how to believe you. - There is no how, either you do or you don't. If it's any consolation, I think about it. A lot. - Jesus, I don't care what you think about. I care about what you do. - I haven't done anything. Better? - What's happening to us? - Last spring is happening to us. We should have given her a name. And a service. But we pretended like nothing happened. - I think about her every day. - You're ashamed and there's a difference between shame and grief. - Don't be smug with me, Paul. - Do you know what I think? I think you don't want this baby. - I want this baby. - What about me? Do you want me? - I don't know. - I'll sleep at the office. - Stephanie! I want you to have my baby! - Stephanie. - Mom. I really need to talk to you. - Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? I'm in labor. - Here let me help you up, come on. - I wanna stay here. - You sure? - Yeah. - Hey. - Hey. - You just missed him. - Yeah. - You wanna try his cell? - No. Hey, look. About what happened. I don't wanna come between you and Paul. - Me and Paul. Remember when we were pregnant that first time, we were so close. And that baby. I felt like I really knew that baby. - I remember, you were happy. - Apparently after 20 weeks, the fetus is not considered medical waste, it's the responsibility of the parents to dispose of the body. We had her cremated, so we're driving home with our box of ashes, and arguing about whether to have a service or not, and Paul wanted one. And I didn't. And we're driving 23 past the corn fields, where they're building there. And, I just road down the window and shook 'em out. Paul just stopped the car and got out and walked away. - What did ya do? - I waited. - He come back? - Paul always comes back. - I'm going to take a plea bargain. - I think that's a good idea. - Criminally negligent homicide. My lawyer says I'll get five years. But if I go to jail for six months then I might be able to get parole. - You'll get parole. - Baby coming soon? - Yeah, soon. Hey. What happened? - I held her. - What? - I held her. She barely moved. She was so small. She wasn't crying. Breathing was all wrong. I knew that she wanted to live but... But I didn't want her to so I... Told her to die. And she did. I killed her with my mind. - Thank you.
