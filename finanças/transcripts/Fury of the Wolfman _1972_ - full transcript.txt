When the sun sets beyond the distant mountains and the full moon glows in the night, in some place on earth a man becomes a wolf. THE FURY OF THE WOLFMAN Waldemar! It must have been horrible, the blizzard, all your friends gone forever. Buried beneath the snow. Fortunately, you were just injured. Poor thing, you must've suffered a lot. Pentagon. Pentagon, pentagon. The outlines of the scar that mark your chest are still indistinct, but if one clay they take the shape of a pentagon, open this box. Inside, you'll find the cure for the ill that afﬂicts you. If after seven moon cycles it still doesn't happen, destroy the box without opening it. When the sun sets beyond the distant mountains and the full moon glows in the night, in some place on earth a man becomes a wolf. The blizzard, we couldn't see anything, and the wind battered us mercilessly. All of a sudden, the creature attacked me. I fought him off. I walked and walked and walked. My companions, what happened to them? We haven't found them, and they'll probably never be found. The mountain has devoured them. That monster was a yeti, but that's not possible. I'm a scientist, and those creatures don't exist. It was a hallucination, nothing more. Yes. Calm down, it was probably just that. A hallucination. If one clay your wound takes the shape of a pentagon... Pentagon, pentagon. Everything mentioned leads us to one conclusion: if it is possible to create a human zebra with fixed frequency brainwaves, then changing a man's genotype and creating a being in a laboratory is viable, one who's reactions can be controlled at will. This could be of great benefit to mankind because we could cure minds damaged by madness, control emotions... In one word, resolve all of man's problems. That's all. My assistant, Ms. Karen, will be at your disposal. She'll take note of any thoughts you might have. Have a good clay. Excuse me, but do you have proof of what she just said? It's a fact, though the technique isn't suffi-- sufficiently advanced, it's just a matter of ti-- ls something wrong, Professor? It's nothing. You can go. You're call came as quite a surprise. So, what exactly have you been feeling? It's incredible. You'll find the explanation here. I'll look at it later. I'll see you tonight in my apartment to give you an answer. Or do you have to go back home? My illness is from Tibet. Anything can happen there. Strange things that science can't admit or explain for now. That's very exciting. It's like a challenge. I was in a remote place very high up in the mountains. I don't know if I saw or dreamed it. There, they spoke of beings who lose their personality on nights with a full moon. Those are just legends. - Perhaps. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Professor, are you sick? - No, it's nothing. You've come back to school too soon. - Perhaps. You must take care of yourself. Thank you for your concern, Karen. Excuse me, Professor, this letter just arrived. It's urgent, but I didn't want to interrupt your class. Thank you, Klaus. Professor. - Yes? I'd like to talk with you if I may. - Go ahead, Karen. I've been meaning to talk to you for a while. I don't know, I'm troubled by the doctor's work. - Why? Could we be treading into forbidden territory? Forbidden? - Yes. It's like we're playing with man's deepest feelings, and that's against nature. Don't worry. The doctor just wants to help mankind through science. I'm glad you said that, so I can calm my nerves. You know how much I admire you. Goodbye. "Your wife is cheating on you with one of the students. You have a trip planned to Kirchenburg, so come back early and keep watch on your house. That way you can see proof of her adultery." It's clone. Are you there? Answer me! Answer me! We had agreed to tamper with his brakes, right? Yes. It was the only solution. You have to understand. Say something. - We'|| meet in the usual place. Erika is cheating on me. Erika is cheating on me. She's cheating on me. She's cheating! She's cheating! It had to be this way. - Yes. We couldn't keep seeing each other just three nights a week, the three nights Waldemar had classes at the University of Kirchenburg. Don't torture yourself. Though I really would've preferred that the storm that wiped out the expedition could have also left us free to do what we want. But they all disappeared except for him. We can't keep talking about things that happened. What now? Now we only have to worry about being happy. We won't have to stay apart. What if something goes wrong? You shouldn't think about that. It's impossible. Let's sit down. - I don't want to be late to the meeting. There's more than enough time. Plus, I see you so rarely. Every clay, or almost. - Yes, but for a very short time. I here to work. I want to be a psychiatrist. And that's more important to you than I am, right? Please, Wilhelm, we always come back to this. Before we get married or anything else, I want to get my doctorate. If you don't stop me, I'll be done in a few months. You know I'd never stop you. I came from Berlin, and I've neglected my parents for many years to study with Dr. Elmann. I'm sorry, Karen, but I don't like that doctor. You're jealous and selfish. No. It's not that exactly. Oh 1 my' Hans. Hans! Erika. Erika? Hans! Mr. Commissioner. Yes? This is the license plate. - All right. There's no sign of the people who were inside. A rather strange accident. There was a murderer, and I believe there's a victim. Our problem is finding them. And believe me, we will. I didn't know you lived together. Yes. We keep each other company. I'd like to speak to you alone. I'm going to put away the first aid kit. All right, we're alone. You can say what you want. Erika is cheating on me. The accident was no coincidence, it was them. When you say "them," I suppose you mean your woman and her lover. - You knew? The husband is always the last one to find out about these things. You must get a hold of yourself. Waldemar, she doesn't deserve you. I don't want you to destroy yourself. Nothing matters anymore. Her love was the only thing that could give me strength to fight the curse. You have me, I'll help you. I'll operate on your brain, I'll cure you. I know what I have to do. Only you know my secret. By the love you and I once felt for each other, keep it. Yes, I promise. But you have to carry out your duty as a man. llona. I thought you had gone to bed. - No. I have to talk to you. Leave me alone! I suppose you heard. I don't have to eavesdrop to know that you've been involved with that man whose heart has just been broken. That's why you're so bitter. Karen! Karen, forgive me. Ma'am, dinner is served and everything's in order. If you don't mind, we'd like to leave now. The village is far away, and the weather is terrible tonight. Very well, you can go. - Oh, I forgot to tell you. Peter came by here, the guys from the center. He told me that the storm had knocked down several posts and there wouldn't be any power tonight. I'll see you tomorrow, ma'am. Good night. Why did you scream? It's me. You didn't expect to see me, right? Well, I've come back to you. And tonight, I'll love you like I have never before. Erika, you're lovely. That's why I love you so much, even if you wish to see me dead. Death has been brewing in me for a long time. What's up? - This just arrived. I noticed it too. It's odd that someone would have a car accident and die under strange circumstances all within a few hours. We'll have to investigate. I think we have an important article here. Yes. "Lovers murdered, Professor Waldemar died by electrocution while ﬂeeing. If this death is strange, then no less mysterious are the claw-like wounds that the corpses of the wife and young man bear. We are awaiting the results of the autopsies." What are you thinking about? I'm going to Dunkerstahd. I'll be back tomorrow. Pack your things. You may be coming with me. To Dunkerstahd? Why? I'll tell you once again. Controlling the cerebral cortex and the hypothalamus is always possible thanks to the chemitrodes. The latest experiments have shown to what extent it's possible to remotely control the human mind. In every which way. It goes without saying that waves sent in succession can create sensations that are hitherto unknown and unsuspected reactions. That's all. I'd like to ask you for a moment of silence in memory of our illustrious colleague Professor Daninsky. Come in. Thank you for seeing me. I'll try to be brief. As you know, Professor Daninsky's death occurred under rather strange circumstances. The information we currently have lead us to believe it wasn't an accident. And you want to... - I don't know. Anything you can tell me may be useful. For example, his studies, his travels. The doctor's specialties covered a very wide field, the autonomic nervous system, the metabolism. He was a genius. I don't think his studies had anything to do with his death. Any lead could be useful to us. I understand. A few clays ago, he returned from a scientific investigation from which he was the only survivor. And to tell you the truth, he seemed a bit strange. Strange? Yes, like he was nervous, ill at ease. Waldemar's death is just an apparent death. The Tibetan scroll clearly shows that he can't truly die except under special conditions, which did not happen in last night's events. Everything is going perfectly fine. Dr. llona Elmann? Yes, that lady there is her assistant. Excuse me, I was wondering if you could let me know about your professor's studies. Basically, she works with chemitrodes. Since I can see you're no specialist in these matters, I'll simplify things. It's an attempt to control people by directing their minds. Chemitrodes. Open the box. It's not dangerous. His mind is being controlled. Take him. Explain yourself, this is all very strange. I couldn't say goodbye any other way. Besides, I'm traveling tomorrow. Where are you going? I don't know yet. You're going on a trip, just like that? And you obey without asking where nor why. That woman has you completely wrapped around her finger. Don't take it so hard. I'll write you, of course. I don't want to say goodbye like this. I don't plan to abandon you, Karen. I think you need me. Very much. - I love you. Yes, sort of. They don't let you love me completely. Yes? Me, yes... No, nothing. I'm in a hurry. Yes, of course, as you wish. Yes, I'm ready. I'll go right away. Bring the wine. Yes, it's Waldemar. His heart is weak. Do you think... Don't touch him! But... The electric shocks will strengthen his heart, and his vitality will attain superhuman heights. That's very dangerous. Keep an eye on Waldemar. This is Karen, a new assistant. These are Heather and Barbara. They're from the University of Stuttgart. They'll be helping us. These underground galleries are full of surprises. The experiments we'll carry out here will revolutionize science. That's what I've been preparing you for years. Take care of Waldemar. Have you heard about the desecration of the graveyard? Yes, and about many other things. But the strangest thing is the theft of Professor Daninsky's corpse. You'd be surprised if you knew what I thought about all of this. What's that? You'll find out. I just came to see the rough prints. I'll be back soon. Wilhelm, be careful. This is dangerous business. Hold it. Explain why you're in this house. I'm a journalist. - I know. Then? That's no reason to break the rules, search a home without authorization, and get mixed up in a murder case that is strictly police business. I was just looking for information to... - Have you found any? You know I haven't. - Not even in the library? What are you trying to say? - That you were in the library. You asked for every book about chemitrodes and you seemed very interested in the studies of Helmut Wolf stein. I don't think that's a crime. No. I also know you've been studying ancient Tibetan legends. The Professor had just come back from an expedition to Tibet. Don't get involved in this. I'm sorry, it's part of my job. - Mine too. I'd like you to tell me your theory. They're just conjectures. If I learn anything, I swear I'll tell you. There's something else that links you to the case, your relationship with Karen, Dr. Ilona's assistant, who happens to be mixed up in the Daninsky investigation. Karen has nothing to do with this. She's just a student. A student who disappeared with the doctor. They're working. - Where? I don't know. Right. And does it seem logical that she'd leave without saying where she was going? No. No, but that's how it is. Anything else? No, that's it for now. The outlines of the scar that mark your chest are still indistinct, but if one clay they take the shape of a pentagon... pentagon, pentagon. What are you doing here? I heard some screams. You know you're not allowed to go in. What's the doctor really up to? She's a scientist. - And those beings? They're at a stag... - No, don't go on. As a student of the doctor's, you're quite fearful. Nature is everything. The earth, the ocean, the wind, the sky. Yes, but also hell and destruction! If you fear everything, you can achieve nothing. The oracles of Dodona were talking oaks. One could hear the sacred trees speaking in the woods. But all of that isn't science, it's occultism, hearsay! ls this hearsay? It's neither animal or vegetable for now, but when it goes beyond this first phase, it will be an authentic mutant, like the ones already living in the crypts. No, I don't want to keep hearing this. I don't! This isn't scientific, it can't be! I don't want to keep... I'm sorry. But we still don't know the whereabouts of Daninsky's corpse. I'm sorry, there's no new information. God, they're nosey. We don't know anything about this case. There are many odd circumstances in this matter. Too many. We should get going. I don't think we're going to get a straight answer here. I don't think the solution lies in learning of the Commissioner's investigations, rather in investigating the forbidden studies of ancient scientists. Will it work? I think so. The chemitrodes will act on the hypothalamus, annulling his destructive instincts. That way we'll be able to control his mind and guide his will. We'll have to wait until the full moon. llona, who was that man in the rubber mask? He's a patient, like the others. Like those mutants, those drug-addled people who live under your care like animals? I'll return them to their human state. They're my patients, and I will cure them. They trust me. I don't know, but sometimes I think that everyone, Waldemar, Heather, those drifters, me, we're all just guinea pigs for your experiments. What are you saying? You know me well. You think I'm capable of something like that? The close was small. The dilation of the iris didn't reach the projected levels. llona, why? Why have you brought me back to life? llona. llona. The full moon is approaching. What will you do with me? While you can tell me what you feel It's very important that we learn what effect the treatment is having. Come on, tell me what you feel. Can you speak? Yes? Who is it? Speak! Trace this number, hurry. Speak, who is this? Speak! Tell us what you saw. Who are what killed him? It's useless. We found this shred of cloth in the victim's hand. Hurry, let the clogs smell it. I'm fear the wolves even more. And the other night we gave them a good lesson. They've lost the trail. What should we do? Go on. Karen, I'll be leaving for a few days. You know what you have to do with Waldemar. Where are you going? I need some products to continue my experiments. What's your goal? What will you do with Waldemar? What are you really planning? I see you're quite worried about his fate. You know what my experiments are. If I can accomplish them, then all the violence, all of man's destructive instincts will disappear from the face of the earth. Humanity is misguided, and it needs to be corrected. You're very young and don't understand these things. But... Listen, little one, just follow orders and don't try to comprehend everything, understand? The outlines of the scar that mark your chest are still indistinct, but if one clay they take the shape of a pentagon... pentagon, pentagon. The outlines of the scar that mark your chest are still indistinct, but if one clay they take the shape of a pentagon... pentagon, pentagon. Karen, where's llona? What have you done with me? llona isn't here. Just you and I are trapped here. They've locked us in. Where was I all this time? I vaguely remember horrible things, violence, blood. llona wiped out your will. She's controlled you at her whim, and I couldn't do anything to stop her. She dominated me. We have to leave this place. We have to find a way. It's useless, I've already tried. We'll try again. There must be a way out. Everything is hermetically sealed. I'll look for something to force the door open. How did you get here? They left the door open. - We have the right to be free. Fools! llona will punish you. A minute of liberty is worth life itself. Long live liberty! Vain, man, work, liberty, life. It's strange. She told me she was going on a trip with you. Well, she told me the opposite. She said she had decided to spend her vacation with you. Anyway, I don't think it's anything to worry about. She probably went to see her parents in Berlin. She'll get in touch soon enough. I'll call her house, that way I can put my mind at ease. After everything that's been happening lately, anything seems possible. Now, you're starting to worry me. I'll wait another clay, and if she doesn't come back, I'll call the police. Ma'am, the police. Ma'am. You're here? Yes. It seems that Ms. Karen isn't with the doctor. Do you have any idea where she is? No, but there's no reason to worry. Perhaps. I'd like to ask you a few questions. Alone. I understand. And I beg you not to write any more articles like today's. I don't want people panicking. But you know... - That's a request. You're the only journalist who knows the details of this case. Be patient. I'll try. - Thank you. Sit down, I'm at your service. They're just standard questions that I didn't ask the other clay, because of your trip. Go ahead. - Now about these latest events... It's useless. This wall has been recently built. it might be an exit. We'll free them. I can't stand to see them locked up like animals. But it could be dangerous, they're abnormal beings. No, they know me. They know I was never cruel to them. Get him! Stop! Can't you hear me? Stop! He's our friend, don't hurt him! I want to help you! She's right, she was always kind to us. llona and the others are our enemies. Free! We're free! Free! It seems that there are only two ways to free me from my curse: being destroyed by another beast like myself, or by having a woman, who loves me enough to die for me, shoot me in the heart with a silver bullet. That woman does exist, Waldemar. I would die for you. It's useless. The doors are reinforced by steel plates. This is a real rat trap. llona's room. We might find something to help us in there. We'll knock down the door. Come on! "Dr. Helmut Wolf stein, Werner Congress, 1933." "Eva Wolf stein's diary. Kirchenburg, April 26th, 1967. Waldemar finally made up his mind, he's marrying Erika Herner. My supplications meant nothing, neither did the memories of the love we shared for three years." "October 8th. Progress is slow but steady. I've managed to control Erika Herner's cerebral cortex, and on occasion, her hypothalamus. Soon I'll do the same with the to her occipital lobe. I've also found the ideal subject for the rest of my plan: student Ludwig Manchet Soon, I'll cause an uncontainable passion between them that will lead them to adultery." "Match 3rd, 1968. Everything is going perfectly well. The waves emitted by the transmitter guide the minds of Ludwig and Erika perfectly. It is now possible to control all of their emotions. The chemitrodes have been a complete success. The experiments that my father began in Berlin are now a reality. I've confirmed his incredible theory." "November 3rd, 1970. Something incredible has happened. Waldemar has made a surprising revelation. He believes he's cursed with lycanthropy. I'll make that a reality. He'll murder his wife and then commit suicide." llona, my daughter. Beer? - Yes. From the castle? - Yes. Why do you ask? This place is out of the way, only villagers and guests from the castle come here. Does that happen very often? No, though lately there's be a lot of movement. Movement? Yes, many cars arrive in the middle of the night with their lights off. I'm very curious, who could tell me about the castle? Frederick's over there. Thank you. Mr. Frederick? - Yes? Forgive me for bothering you, but I'm a journalist. I'd like information on Castle Wolf stein. Go ahead. I really don't know, but I think what's happening inside affects me directly. That's a place I'd never dare to go. Why? The ambience, the solitude that surrounds it, everything is sinister My parents were servants there when Helmut Wolf stein was alive. Wolf stein? - Yes, he was the owner. And now? - The owner is his daughter. His daughter? Yes. She's also a doctor and a professor at the University of Kirchenburg. Thank you. Yes? This is Wilhelm Kaufman. I've investigated the matter well and there's no doubt, llona and Eva Wolf stein are the same person. Impossible. - I have proof. The daughter of Helmut Wolf stein, the Killer Doctor... Dr. Wolf stein, neurologist and famous for his studies on the nature of the human mind. He sacrificed many people in his experiments. I know. When the police surrounded him, he locked himself in his lab and set it on fire. The whole house turned to ashes. Exactly, and llona is his daughter. I'm convinced that she's behind all the strange occurrences that have been happening in this region. Your hunch coincides with our own. I followed the doctor to the foot of the Carpathian Mountains. She entered Bremen. The Wolf steins' ancient home. You see? Everything fits. Listen, don't do anything. Wait for us there. We won't get there until morning. And, besides, we've gotten ahead of the men. We should stop for a while and wait for them. No, we have to get there as soon as possible. I fear the worst. It was them, Karen let them loose. They also killed your father. Karen? Karen? I have Karen. Don't take another step, or your beloved Karen will suffer a fate worse than death. With his science, he gave me infinite power. I can turn her into this... into any other being. Or into anything I want. I will destroy everything that could separate us. But you, I'll keep you... for myself The moon is starting to rise, the full moon. And you, my perfect lover, I have two surprises in store for you. llona, your perversity and madness will turn against you. Soon you will be a beast under my control. I assure you that as a man you'll be my slave. Yes, it's your wife Erika. I took her from her grave. I brought her back to life for you. But you should know that before you ripped her throat out you wounded her over the heart and passed on the curse of the pentagon. Look, Waldemar. Hello. - You took a long time. Be patient. - Please, Karen is with her. I'll go with you. I know the castle and all its entrances very well. All right, let's go. It's Karen, so pure, so naive. Young, perfect as a goddess. And you will destroy her, but only after defeating Erika. It's Waldemar, your husband and his lover. He killed yours, the one you loved. He also gave you his curse. He turned you into a monster. This is the only entrance that can be forced. And inside? Perhaps the portcullis is open. We'|| have to take a risk. - I think so too. Come on, hurry. Open this door. Be still. I want to see if you love him or hate him. I'll let you take the initiative. Let's go! Kill Karen. Kill her. Obey me! Kill her! The underground entrance is just ahead. Not even the most fevered imagination could conceive half of the horrors we've seen. And I'm still convinced that when we investigate more deeply... Those disgusting hippies are like lab rats on which Wolf stein unleashed the horrors of his madness, well assisted by his daughter Eva. Gentlemen, let's forget this, so Ms. Karen can too. See, it's a splendid clay. THE END
