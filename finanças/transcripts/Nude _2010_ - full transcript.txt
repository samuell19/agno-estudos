On the first day I started AV shooting, the Director told me to be happy in front of the camera. Because I look good on screen. The audiences would be happy to see that too. I try to do that until now. Hello. Thanks for your help. Okay, l will adjust it. Acting pornographic before the camera, I am already a professional. Though I was not confident at the beginning. Sorry, I have just delivered before deadline. Yes, we should transfer the computer today. I think it should be on the way. To everyone, sex should be one to one. Who can have sex with a stranger in front of the shooting crew? However, in the world of AV, a threesome with one woman and two men is normal. There are no threesomes in my private life. When I make love with my lover, I can't stand... if there is one more person. If my love made love with another person in front of me, that would hurt me. Okay, cut. Okay. Good. Where is Mihiro? She is on the balcony. On the balcony? Yes. Okay. Hiromi. What are you looking at? I am looking at you, Mr. Enomoto Me? You were talking on the phone when you were coming in. Are you writing your autobiography? I will keep writing. The Editors said, they hope you write something which should be keep secret. The lives of AV actresses are so hard. You should get the attention of readers Please, Mihiro. Okay. Oh, you are so hot. Comfortable? Yes! Keep going. Yes, take more scenes. Great! Great! I am gonna cum. Almost... I am cumming. Cut, Okay. Nice. Thank you. How is that? Does it hurt? I am fine. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you. There are scripts for AV shooting. I act in sex scenes through the dialogue in the scripts. The actors are nice. I never met anyone terrible. I am coming. Hello. Mihiro, you can take a rest. For 30 minutes? I think there should be an hour. Thanks! Sorry to bother you. I came to Tokyo when I was 18. I lived in Niigata before that. I am a normal girl. Why didn't you tell me? You are going to find a job in Tokyo. You never told me that! Sa, don't be angry. My Dad wants me to do something like my relatives. So meaningless. I will be security in the airport. There's a lot of luggage in the airport. Checking if they are safe is time consuming. Airport. Tokyo. What? When are you planning to go? The day after tomorrow. What?! But I am frustrated now. My boyfriend will go to Tokyo. We will leave you at home. Wait for me. You do not want to break up with your boyfriend. But you do not care to split up with me? That did it. Work hard in Tokyo. Sa. Wait for me. Sa. When we were sharing our expectations of careers, we looked up at the sky. The planes are up there. I want to be a flight attendant. If I can be an attendant, that should be great. But you have to study in professional college before being an attendant. But I really want to be an attendant. I think working in the airport is fine. I can still find this kind of job. But security is totally different from being an attendant. Not at all. They are both important jobs. So you have made up your mind? Yes. I will go. An ordinary person like me, cannot go on an adventure like Hiromi. I cannot go to Tokyo. Are you really OK? Here is a small village. But Tokyo is the capital of Japan. Do you understand? I hoped I would be discovered in Shibuya And then become an actress. I want to be an actress. I want to be in the show-biz. What are you talking about? I want to be an actress. So bad. Really bad. No. Sa... Hiromi is pretty, it is a pity to stay in the village. I do think so. However... However... If you are going to Tokyo, I do think something is wrong. If you become another person, I will not accept it. Never. Sa. I really like you. Do not cry. I do not want to separate from you. We are best friends. I really want to cry. Look, there is a shooting star. Did you make a wish? It was too quick. This is the first time I saw one. Me too. Let's make a wish. What? What is your wish? Quiet. What is that? Quiet, keep quiet. A few days later I set out for Tokyo to work at the airport, but I think I left Niigata because I wanted to be an actress. Good Morning. Good Morning. Good Morning. Good Morning. Where shall we go today? To watch a movie. Good Morning. Is that all? Say your reason. I am asking you. On the plane, a bottle with liquid is prohibited. I want you to explain. Excuse me, sir. Because of anti-terrorism protocols, carry on of liquids is now prohibited. I never heard of it! Would you mind checking your luggage? You should tell me earlier. Excuse me, do you want to be a model? No, thanks. Excuse me, do you have a second? Do you want to be a model? I have an artist agency. I approached you because I really think you are pretty. A girl like you, can be a model starting from tomorrow. Really? Hiromi. What's up? Call me if you're interested. Anytime. What is the matter? Careful, many of them are frauds. Let's go. This is the process of logistics. This is the end of today. Do not forget to do your revision. Yes. "Sa, an agency approached me" "I will go to the agency office" What is the matter? Nothing. This is so beautiful. This is Hiromi's. We exchanged this when she left. You are really good friends. I heard she has gone to Tokyo. I think she is doing well. So jealous. HEY- Let's go barbeque. Great! I can invite my boyfriend. Sayaka can invite him, too. Here it is. Look! Photo of you two. Do you often come to Shibuya? Yes. For shopping and karaoke. Karaoke? Yes. Let's talk about work. On these print ads, they are the girls of my agency. Nude? We are actually an AV agency. In additional to the print model agency. We have different kinds of business. Isn't it an artist agency? We will let the artists sing also. Hiromi, what do you want to be? For instance... acting, modeling, or dancing and singing? I want to try everything. Really? Excuse me. Hello. Excuse me. In the beginning, it is difficult to be an artist. You have to do it step by step. In order to get popular, shooting this kind of photo is a good way. Okay. Don't be that difficult. Call me if you are interested. I will give you a job immediately. We never force our artists. I refuse to shoot AV as a condition, but I decided to be a nude model. At the same time, I resigned from the job in airport. Good Morning. Good Morning. Is there any fax? I have put it on the table. The fax has come? Do not ask. This is the girl. This girl? Okay. Boss. Please look at this. Okay. Hello. Hello. He is the manager, Mr. Enomoto. Are you Hiromi? Yes. Mr. Enomoto wants me to give you a good porn name. What name is good? My porn name? What name is good? Please help me. Mihiro. Nlihiro? Mihiro. Is that good? That's great. So, Mihiro, work hard. Um... Thank you. This is our new star Mihiro. This is her first time here. She must be very nervous. Please treat her well. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you... Are you ready? Yes, I am fine. That's good. So beautiful. Yes. Mihiro, are you nervous? A little bit. It will be fine, the photo will be good Good. Your hair. Yes, fiddle like this. Yes. Mihiro is so beautiful. Really good. Can you take off your one piece? Yes. Smile. Yes. Alright. Please take off the shoulder strap. This one? Yes, take off it. Now please turn to the back. Yes. Take off the hook. Okay. Good. So pretty. Very good. Very good. The feeling is good. Right. So beautiful. Yes, very good, isn't it? Very good. Yes. My technique is awesome, isn't it? Yes. This one is good, too. You can have it. Really? Yes. Thank you. This is like another person. My name is... Nlihiro? Good. Yes. Very Good. Please sit down there. Okay. There are five to six shoots a month for the model job. I did not like to be unoccupied. I worked for two part time jobs. In that period, my boyfriend often came home and asked me to give him money for living. I am home. I am home. Sorry, I am late. Eisuke, how about a burger for dinner? Eisuke, what is the matter? You are so strange. I bought the ice cream you wanted. What are these photos? This is my job. What kind of job is it? Can you resign immediately? If you resign, I will not say anything. Eisuke, sorry that I did not tell you. However... I have to continue working. I do not want to resign now. You said you will not resign? What are you thinking? Doing poses like that for strangers. Your nude photo will be spread everywhere. Do you know what are you doing? I am sorry. Sorry. I am sorry. I was a little bit over. Sorry. I hate to let other guys to look at your body. I hate it. Really hate it. After that, my job as a model increased steadily. I became the top model in the agency. This made me proud of myself. Don't you like it? You like it already. Don't fool around. Don't... Look at the face. What? This is real. Just kiss it if you like that. No... Don't you like it? Look carefully. This is Yamase. Aren't you classmate of Yamase? Yamase was my classmate, so? Here it said that she is Yamase. I heard that she is working in the airport. This is absolutely Yamase. You should be wrong. She has showed her breasts. If that was real, will she come back to Niigata? Call her and ask. Say we are her fans. Call her. Call her. You know her number, right? Is it really Hiromi? I cannot believe it. You see. Her name is Mihiro, from Niigata. This should be her. It cannot be burnt. Does Yamase have a boyfriend? She has. If I were him, I will break up with her immediately. However, letting her earn money for me is good. Then you will be her pet. I do want to be a pet. Do not say anymore. Sorry. She will regret this part of her life. After having a child, the kid will say mama is a porn star. So disgusting. I do not care. Though she is pretty, her life will be over with this job. However, I think this job is more suitable for her than that one in the airport. She looks like she can have sex with man easily. Hiromi will not having sex with men without concern. Maybe there is some reason for her to do this. Please do not blame her. That hurt! That hurt! Do not fight. Do not fight. I am going home. Sa, What's up? Do you know what kind of job you are doing? Very normal job, what is the matter? Did you meet some bad guys there? What are you talking about? Just say it plainly. You are shooting nude photos. Is that real? That is real. How do you know that? What? What are you doing? Do you feel happy to let the men look at your butt? Is that what you want to be? Your parents will also know that. If they know that, they will cry. Why don't you work in another industry? Why do you keep silent? I guessed it right, didn't I? You are so bad to do that. I will never agree. You are insane. Sa will never understand. I have sent you email. But you never reply. I said that you were entering local college, you can forget me. Do not think me as your friend anymore. I do not need your agreement. Just leave me doing that. I do not agree you neither. Do not think me as your friend anymore. So bad. That bitch! Call Mihiro. Sorry, but she did not pick up the phone. What can we do? Please come along. Prepare as what I said. Hiromi. Do you feel upset? Come out. Let's talk here. Your job is in progress. Do not be that naive. Do you know what big trouble you brought us? Hiromi. Mihiro. Can you hear me? Mihiro. Can you listen to me? I understand your feeling. I had the same feeling as you. But you are a professional actress, aren't you? If you are, you have to finish your job today. Can you open the door? Alright, let's go. She is about to retire. She has done everything in AV industry. She will retire soon. You have to plan for your next step, too. Then do I have to shoot AV? I did not say that. Work happily. If you do not work hard, you will soon be replaced by others. I do not hate my work. Frankly, movies, TV shows... I pay every effort to make you popular. However... You will not become famous if you do not work as a nude model. If you work for other agencies, you will have less work than you do now. I just want to say that. Yes. This is a job of Movie V. You have to take off clothes but it is really a movie. This is totally different from the work of modeling and TV shows. Take it? Yes, please. If you repeat what had happened today, I will terminate the contract. However... from day one I saw you in Shibuya, I could feel your ability. You have to trust me. Everything can be discussed. Are you angry? Of course. Because I am a manager. What I have to do is to help you to reach a higher goal. The heart of Men, I knew it since a long time ago. They are more colorless like glass. There is nothing complicated. But Mr. Enomoto seems different. I slept so well. Morning, honey. I want to live with my Lord from now on I am your pet come from the future. Nice to meet you. My pet comes from the future? How shall I start? Cleaning, washing clothes and cooking! And... so... much... more. Good, cut. Cut. Okay... Mihiro acts really good. Change the scene. Help me to clean up. Next scene will be a challenge. Please take a rest first. Okay. Good? Yes Do you want a coffee? I am getting one for you. The name of Movie V is "Karami" There are many filthy and nude scenes. I kept thinking that it was an attempt to train my acting. Eisuke. Mr. Enomoto. I will stop there. Thanks. Good bye. I am home. You are home. I am home. Hiromi. The truth is... Will you marry me? Can you promise me? What is the matter with you? I feel unsecured. You are so beautiful. I understand you want to be an artist. But... I feel you are going away from me. Hiromi. You are not continuing the nude model job, right? I am so happy about that. Therefore... I will earn your part. I promise. After I have got a stable job, I want to marry you immediately. I was continuing the nude model job. But I did not tell him. Hiromi and Mihiro, is continuing her own performance. I love you. Sa, how do you do? I have been a nude model for a year. I think I can attend a TV show. There will be an interview tomorrow. I keep working hard for today. I just want to let you know. You do not need to reply me. I will work hard. How does Mihiro spend your holiday? I'm going shopping. What will you buy? For clothes... I buy what is popular. Some simple clothes. You can ask whatever you want. Do you go shopping in Shibuya? Yes. Thank you Good Bye. Excuse me. Thanks. Thank you, excuse me. Thanks. We are leaving now. What is the matter with you? You have given a really bad impression. You said I should say something special You do not need to do too much. You just need to talk naturally. You hope to let people think you are very good. Do not think that everyone will praise you. I am sorry. In order to let this happen, do you know how much effort I have made? After that, there is no producer approaching me. He said something really bad like there are many people can replace me. Miss, if you are feeling upset, we don't have to talk. Yes. Are you working as a model? You are so pretty, you should not feel upset. How do you know? I am a model. Yes, are you Mihiro? I know... I often see you on magazine. I check thoroughly when there is a photo on the magazine. Thank you. Do not leave anything. Okay. Can you give me an autograph? So kind of you, thank you. I will support you, please work hard. Thanks. You have to work hard, too. Sa. Oh, I think you are not here. Long time no see. Are you unhappy? HEY- I came from Niigata to see you. Shouldn't you let me inside? Sa. I am sorry. I was being rude, too. I am really bad. Do you cook? Yes, I cook for myself. Yummy. That is my recipe. And I am addicted to it. Let's eat. Delicious. You have so many things. Because I have to keep up my image. Is your job going well? Yes, I am happy. So excited. They always say my pose is good, or my expression is good. I feel I have become a professional. I like to take photos. I can work what I like, isn't that good? I like your photos with clothes more. You said you are a professional? I do not understand. They praise your acting well. And ask you to do some pose that men like. The job is exploiting girls' youth You are more beautiful than a normal girl Girls like me will never work like this. But... I do not want you to regret. I am starting to act now. I'm taking part in Movie V I am happy to act. There's some love scenes though. Can you reject it? Can't you reject it? Why can't you be the simple Hiromi? Sa. I cannot. Because I am doing quite well. I hope you understand. Really? You will not reject it, even if I beg you. How is everyone? We are all the same as before. You should come home sometimes. Relax. On that day, we slept together. Sa asked me to not see her off. She went back to Niigata with her familiar smiling face. Hello. Hello, is that Hiromi? It is. Can you come back to the office right now? Now? There is a famous producer wants to see you. If he likes you, your career will be very good. I think she is working too hard. I will wait for her. Excuse me. Mr. Sato, she is Mihiro. I am Mihiro. This is Mr. Sato, the producer. I am Sato. Please be seated. I heard that you want to be an actress. Yes. What kind of actress do you want to be? It seems that you have given up. Don't you? Are you working as if you are playing? No. I am not playing. You shoot nude photos. And you shoot the love scenes of Movie V. But you never shoot AV. Doesn't that mean you've given up? I don't really know the difference between Movie V and AV. They are different. I do not shoot AV. I have a boyfriend. I think ones who shoot AV do it just because of the money. If you do not shoot AV, then do not shoot Movie V. So I said you have given up. Although you are working hard, I do not even know the name Mihiro. Maybe you get a little bit famous because of the magazine. But you are a nobody in the movie industry. And you will be forgotten very soon. No one will be interested in you even you shoot AV then. Mihiro. Mr. Sato is saying that for your own good I come here because I know a pretty girl like you is neglected. I am not interested about what you will become. I am leaving. Thanks. Good bye. Sorry to bother you. Thank you. Thanks and good bye. Are you OK? Hiromi. Why do you sit that in front of me? He was being a little bit rude. But I share the same opinion with him. Mr. Sato cares about you. He thought you are pitiable. Why pity me? AV is too pornographic. It is totally different from Movie V. Hiromi, listen to me. Mr. Enomoto wants me to shoot AV, don't you? If I shoot AV, you will earn a lot of money, right? Why? Do not beat about the bush. Why don't you say that plainly? I am sorry. Although Mr. Sato was a little bit rude this industry has been around for a long time. Everyone is doing it. If you shoot AV, you will become famous. People will remember your name after you shoot AV. You are still talking about something good. But what you have done is prepare for me to shoot AV. There are all AV girls in our company. I know it is impossible for me to stand out from them. I hope you understand that, I want you to shoot AV, not just for money. But... you will reach a dead end very soon. Of course, you can make the final decision. Nobody will force you to do. There is no stars can be seen in Tokyo, But the night scenes are beautiful. Which one? A bashful look. To lick. Lick more. Lick more. Finger move more. Finger move more. I have signed contracts to shoot 24 AVs with two companies. Excuse me. This is so-called well-treated in AV industry. The contract is valid for two years. Which means my productions will be released one per month. Thank you. Nomi. Yes. Put the camera here. Okay. This time the producer can earn US dollars. Sorry, now... I was scolded. No, I did not. When I am doing that... I am here. Good Morning... Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. Why do you give me an ugly girl? Who is he? Actor. Have a conversation first. After that, start to do. And then... Like this? Yes. He is an experienced actor. You can let him lead you. Hiromi. This is not love, this is a job. A job. Come in. Sorry to bother. We will start soon. 15 minutes left. Please. Okay. If you feel hurt, tell me. You do not need to struggle. Are you listening? If there is something... Stop it! What is the matter with her? We cannot work like that. Is there any problem? As normal. Normal, but it should be reasonable. Do not mind anything. Devote yourself happily to the movie. Does the director know? Yes. I have to keep up training. This can keep good health, and help sexuality. Really? Yes. Drink this. Here you are. Really? Please. Mihiro. Face the camera happily. Your expression will be recorded. The audiences would be happy to see that too. Okay. Let's start. Okay. Reapply some makeup. Okay. The actor have to be ready, please. Please. Alright. Let's start now. Alright. Then I go on the bed. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. The massage device. We do not need it today. I am sorry. The lighting today is so hot. The pillow is not comfortable. Do you like ice-cream? Ice-cream. Me? I love Chocolate ice-cream. Mihiro. What do you like? Has the camera started? I like ice shavings. You will have a stomachache. When I touch the actor, I feel his body is warm. Has the camera started? Keep continue. Right. Your breast is so beautiful. Stick out your tongue. I am going to insert my finger. You look carefully. No... Mihiro. Look at my face. Close the eyes. Think he is Eisuke. Mihiro. Do you enjoy? Eisuke. Cut, nice. Change the tape. Okay. It is ready. Alright. Mihiro, please take off the towel. I am coming. That make me shy. Do not shoot my face. Faster! Are you okay? I am fine. The shooting will continue. At eight o'clock. Yes. Hiromi, is this OK? I put it here. Everyone said that you were acting well I was so nervous, too. 30 minutes later... You can have a rest first, wait here. Hiromi. I will pick you up tomorrow at 7. Alright. Thank you. Thanks. I am home. You are home. Today is so late. Today is cold. I have made a hot pot. And I have bought some beer. Eisuke. Thank you. It looks delicious. Really? I am sorry to be spending your money. So I have bought you some great meat. Really? I am tired. I want to start now. Good. HEY- When will you have your holiday? I want to go somewhere with you. I love you. I love you, too. Hiromi. Let's not use a condom. No. No...No. No. What is the matter? Why do you cry? I am sorry. Really. I will use a condom. I am sorry. Why do you cry? Hiromi. No. I am continuing.... I am continuing that job. As a nude model. I know. I know you so well. I know you will never stop that job. I pretended I do not know. I want to love you more. Then you will know, You will be happy with me. I am the one who understand you the most. If I work harder, will you resign from that job? I am waiting for you to resign. You have almost come back to my side. I believe. Eisuke, sorry. I am shooting AV. Started today. Really? Eisuke, I am sorry. Sorry. Eisuke, I am sorry. Sorry. Stop it! I am breaking up with you. You have done nothing wrong. But I... I am happy when you come here. I am so selfish. Sorry. Why do you do that? Why? I love you so much. Hiromi... You will keep doing this, won't you? I knew it. Do not do that. You hurt me. You cheat the girls here, and forced them to do this kind of job. It was decided by herself. We did not force her. My daughter said... she was cheated. Speak! Come here, please. What? You can ask her here. Please wait. Let's have something to eat. After my boyfriend left me, my job continued. Mihiro. As a new AV girl, I started my singing business. I am happy to sing in front of my fans. Thanks Thanks for your applause. Thanks! I am Mihiro. We know you. I am so happy that you come to my concert. My singing career is just starting, I want to be a person who makes you happy. Please keep supporting Mihiro. Thanks. Mihiro... Thank you. Thank you very much. We will always love you. Thank you. Keep going. Thanks! You are home, Sa. Dinner will be ready soon. Feels so great. Do you feel it? Feels so great. So great! Hiromi. Push. You are so happy. You even shoot this. Are you really happy? The body is so beautiful. Can you feel it? Feels so great. So great! Do you feel thirsty? I am not a doll. I am about to cum. Sa. I will not regret it. I will keep on going. Hiromi, how are you? I am still living as normal. Good? Please get ready. Coming. From a while ago, your AV is spread out in Niigata. I have seen it too. I cannot understand you. Contact between you and me... this is the last time! Maybe I am doing too much, but I am canceling the wish I made when we saw the shooting star. I wanted to be good friends with you forever. But deep in my heart, I cannot accept a Hiromi like you. I am sorry. Excuse me, is Hiromi ready? Sorry, I'll go check. Okay, cut. Hey, you! How could you stop you hand? You want to let our actress wait? Do it seriously, okay? I am sorry. Do it again. Okay. Please. He is a newcomer, sorry. Mihiro, please be the leading role. This is not just terrifying, but also painful and delightful. Okay? Okay. Are you okay? Why do you look in a daze? No, I am fine. You have to resist, but you cannot outplay men's strength. You cannot get the climax at once. You have to feel it. You feel terrified at the beginning. Your expression will become frozen. I get it. Okay, start. Okay Reapply the makeup. Yes. This time is for real. Okay. Ready? This time is for real. Camera ready. Ready, go. I am coming. No... If you resist, I will kill you. Kill me. So beautiful. I miss this place. I wish to come here. Sa, listen. My wish has come true. Sa. Sa... You are awake. Great. Are you OK? How are you feeling? What about the shooting? It will be fine. You have made a stir. The actor asked if he hurt you. He was scared and came to apologize. I am fine now. This is the end of today, the director said. You keep writing, won't you? I will go to the scene. Okay. I was like sleeping for a long time. "Her story is just beginning." I like you so much. I like you so much. Hug me tightly. I beg you. I like you so much. I like you so much. Hold me tight. I like you so much. Hold me tight. I beg you.
