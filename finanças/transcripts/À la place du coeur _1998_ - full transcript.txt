Come on dad you are getting older I'm tired. He is 6 years older than me. Her name is Sophie, but I I always call her Sister. Now everyone calls her that, less in the faculty. Come on, hurry up, lazy. You will see! If the lawyer wants money, Tell him to call me. What will change that? You tell him to call me. For what? If you want money, wants money. Do what little sister tells you. He is a friend of my teacher, He won't talk to me like that. Okay, whatever you want. We will manage. Of course baby It's like family. It is from the family. Put us something to drink. How would... B?b?'s mother, let's celebrate A sacrament I have not gone crazy. We will toast For a new life. Clim is going to have a child of B?b?. It serves. How long is it? It will be 4 months. Four months? I thought so. Four months. Just before the arrest. - Do you want to have it? - Yes Dad. And baby too. Do not think I want to reproach you for anything but baby I mean the big one ... It is not easy to have A baby at your age. And his father is in jail. That is why I ask you. It's disgusting, But we will help you. I can manage alone. Do you think I can't? - Of course you can. - You think you are invincible, but to me You consider me useless. - What's the matter, Clim? - Nothing. He's my son. I'm not as strong as you I don't study, But he is my son. I'm sorry, I didn't want ... Do your parents know? You want Let him tell Franck? Clear. I hope it's a boy. Old Franck is going to hallucinate. What if we all go? It is Saturday and we still have foam. Are you agree? Clim, do you feel like it? The first time That we made love It was weird. We did not see it coming, It happened suddenly. We did not know That was the case forever. We could not see the moment. But the moment He had seen us for a long time. He was there waiting for us. was totally available. I played cards, sent kites to space, inspired dreams in hearts, shattered revolutions. I just expected that those two boys that entertained after school They will make an appointment. One afternoon, like any other, I felt his sex inside me. I didn't see it until A few weeks later, July 14, When he came back with a sculpture. He had done it. I saw something that nobody else saw. B?b?'s face It was bigger than the world. His eyes were deeper than the sun, more vast than the desert. All the universe, From the beginning, It was on his face. How are you All right? And you? This is Khalil, my boss. Delighted, Miss CI im. Come eat. Identity Control They are together? Any problem, agent? I had never seen it In your world. I had not seen love and respect That men have. I had not seen him laugh like that. As if his laugh went up of the balls. Yes, the laugh went up of the balls. How I loved him I could understand. If I don't want to go home, I sleep here Let you? My father trusts me, and my mother thinks I get high and robbery Listens. I am a normal guy. I will not fuck your life I won't hit you I don't go after the girls. I smoke weed from time to time, But I've never stung Clim, what I want to say is... I can't offer you much. I have no money, you know it. I do shit jobs to eat. I don't drink with the system, so you too You must work. That does not scare me. And when you get home, i will probably be working with my chisels, and maybe you have the impression I don't know you exist But you shouldn't think about it. Never. When i leave the tools, I will return with you. Forever. I need you, I love you. Are you doing well? 2. 3. 4 Of course. You are doing well. I barely had a chest then, Even if it was a few months ago. I didn't remember seeing before B?b?'s sex, but I sure had seen it, Like your legs And he had seen mine. they made us go up and down the stairs, towards each other. Do not be afraid. Do not forget that I am yours. And it wouldn't hurt you For nothing in the world. You just have to get used to me. We have it all The time of the world. Upon discovering his body, I also discovered that I had one. And that she was a virgin. Well, more than a virgin, was a girl. Do you love me, Clim? I mean... you like what does love make you? You just want to hear me say. If true. And so? So what? Why don't you say so? It is as if I had passed over a truck. It's the biggest what happened to me. Me too. We look to see how? If you want... I will see your parents. You don't have keys? Have you seen the time? We were very worried. What happened to you? Is it time to come back? Dad almost called the police. I'm sorry, Mrs. Patch?. It is my fault. Weeks ago I didn't see Clim, We had a lot to tell each other. We are a little late. We want to get married. Jo?l Come right away, this is incredible. I don't know what you've seen in her. Can you give me an explanation? You have no respect for your mother, Not for your sister, not for me? Do not be angry. I love your daughter, that's why I was absent so long. Understand it, Mrs. Patch?. He had things to do and ... I tried with other girls. But I love her. I suddenly feared that was gone So I ran back. And I don't want to leave anymore. We have always been together. You know what I'm worth. He is his father. He knows that I love her If not, I would not be here. He would have let her down. How old are you? 18 years. Do you think they are enough to get married? I do not know. How will you feed her? How did you feed her? 500,000 unemployed years ago. Three million now. And you have a job? I am a sculptor. It won't be easy, but I will arrive To be a good artist. Have you asked him who married you? Are you announcing it to me or asking me permission? Both. What would you do in my place? I would ask her. Do you love him Do you want to marry him? What if I refuse? I want you to say yes, because I love you. Mom is disappointed. I expected marry Alberto de Monaco. All fixed, You marry B?b?. It's okay. I'm glad. And you, why don't you get married and do you leave dad and me alone? You would miss me. You are totally crazy, But this had to happen. Only it is very soon. Take care of each other. What do you do? Do you remember the star what did i give you I look at her often. I also. B?b? doesn't know who can't have children, But I know it's her. It is sterile by vocation. It's like being a nun. Adopt two children at once it's like getting points at the gas stations. Believes in God? it's a ticket to heaven B?b?'s mother clings to heaven, and his daughter too. You've seen to my son's hair? It's okay, sends you a kiss. Aren't you very hard on him? I ask you because you He tells you things that he doesn't tell me. Secrets of lovers. He is very brave, he will endure. But there Than get him out of there. If it wasn't inside, We would not have to get him out. Do we drink a glass of this sparkling? Does it bother you, Mrs. Lopez? Who cares if it bothers me, or not? Blondine, bring glasses. I'll help you. Bring the B?b? cake. 3. 4. 5 I'll make another one. How do you feel? Well I ... What do you think of Mr. Assas, lawyer? I would like to be strong, but I have no courage to visit it. I'm even ashamed go to the church. The doctor says I have to take care of my heart He told me:"Mrs. Lopez, don't forget that his son needs his mother more Than get out of jail. " I don't care about me God sustains me. Do you know, Mrs. Patch?? When this lasts the most, I'm more sure that God is testing us. The jail are not bars and walls, but a door. The guards don't have The key is here. If you know how to use it to open the door, so... - Maybe he's right. - Yes. It is He who It puts us to the test. He never abandons to his children. I know it's not fashionable, But I believe in God. I know that he takes care of me and of those who love him. We live in a world of hate where respect, mercy and love They don't mean anything anymore. Without God, we would only be monkeys. But God is full of love. I wonder how does God think you should act When your son is in shit - Franck! - What? You say he doesn't abandon his children. And what happened to yours? He crucified him. Sure that I wanted to get rid of him. But I am not like that. I will be full of love When my son comes out of hell. I will be full of love when I hugged him and looked into his eyes. Then i will be full of love. And if that doesn't happen, I will roll some heads. If you keep mentioning to Jesus, Mary and Joseph With those who always sleep, with whom you spend the day instead of taking care of your son, yours will roll the first. How dare you? I have to do everything. Have you come for your daughter to insult me? Insulting you? I've just asked you why don't you go see your brother I have already gone! Only once and you didn't stay Not five minutes. And now you sit there and you act like Vanessa Paradis. Why do we provide? Father? I have announced to B?b? That he will be a father. at that time something it passed through Franck's eyes. They nailed in my father?s, took him by the hand, and both Without moving, They set out on a long journey. A long and strange journey. Not long ago my father made houses where people ate made love I cried and laughed. B?b?'s father repaired engines of ships that crossed the seas. Other men, somewhere, They unloaded the ship. When you had to work hard, They negotiated with their bosses. Franck in the harbor, Jo?l in his cement. From man to man, and often they got its objective. After three days and three nights of uninterrupted work, they were coming home with bright eyes of fatigue, but thinking of useless things They could buy us. But it had exploded a storm, the job had disappeared. They were no longer young, Or irreplaceable. They no longer negotiated, they were afraid. Jo?l builds real estate hates And Franck repairs bad machines They barely cross the Mediterranean. the world had changed very fast, and they didn't care the ones he left behind. I even reproached them Not being able to follow him. The world humiliated them. Love with 16 years? What I cams Inside will never be a child. Do you want me to abort? How could he leave you pregnant in jail? You will not ruin my family. My son never entered there and never left anything of his In your gut Never! Do you hear me? Never! - Father! - What? - Your heart! - What? Still beats, But that is not a heart. I'm glad, Clim, a lot. God! Look at these. I remember the night We conceive the child. It was the day we found a floor. the guy's name was Levy, And he was very good people. We have almost arrived. All good? You'll see, There are many things to throw away. Come on, get in. Have you seen what a mess? But they are young. At his age, Nothing is too much. I'm not like those old men They hate young people. I think they don't hate young people, but themselves. They turn against young people Because they can still love. And them They do not love themselves. If you like it, They can keep it. Take away all this, they put some blankets, they sleep there And they make a son. I was also born in a workshop. The world needs children, So make us some babies. They have to do them now that they are young and that they still have inside The cry of the baby they were. I have no children, They will wonder why. It is a long story, very sad To be able to tell it. Do not worry about the neighbors. They are workshops that close at 6. No one To touch the eggs. Two months in advance. In agreement? If it is okay. Well, install yourself quietly. Clean it and paint it a little. So, they will only pay at the second month It's very kind, sir. It all happened that day. Happiness does not come alone, there are always winding roads and you never know what waiting for you in the corner Leave it, baby. He started touching my ass Yeah right. - Shut up! - It was her. Where were you? In the store. Is that so, my son? - Yes! - I am not your son. You are right, you are not my son. Now here near. You will have the papers In order, I hope. Don't you expect otherwise? The papers! It's okay. We will see each other again. I will not forget you. Do not do that again. The what? - Protect me. - You have protected me. That is different. Hey, lovebirds. You will be hungry. And without a hard. Miss Clim. I do it for you. You understand? For her. You will starve her. It is like a stick. Two dishes of the day, I guess. You suppose well, Arabic. Well, I'll bring it to you right away. You can't always be over my. I've already left alone a thousand times And nothing has happened. It's not your fault. I don't want to be separated. We are very fragile. They can tear us apart whenever you want. That night we conceived the child. I know from the way B?b? I touch myself, He hugged me and penetrated me. I grabbed him with all my strength, I followed all his movements, And I felt life Life. His life that flooded me And he was staying in me. Do not move. Open it. When can we take it out, Mr. Assas? It is a very difficult case. We miss him. I do what I can. Mrs. Radik You must change your testimony. But it has disappeared. Missing? How can it disappear? This is a great city from a great country, People disappear. It can be close, Or he may have returned to Sarajevo. Sarajevo? How could it have gone so far from France? There is nothing against her. It's free. I will try to find her. Needs money? You are right. Hopefully, I will find her in a couple of days. I only know that he left his house Without leaving any address. Can you use it against her? She accused B?b?. She is a poor immigrant traumatized by a violation. His behavior is normal. If we don't find it, There will be no trial. The crime has been recognized. The case continues With or without her. And there is that cop that identified B?b? Like the rapist. He says he saw B?b? leave the building He is a liar. The two policemen saw Someone running away. The policeman says it's B?b?. They entered and found Mrs. Radik. The policeman forced her to say that. It is his word against his. He is a fascist, a racist. He hates young people. We can't sue him For your opinions. We will only get B?b? If we show that he lies. I think B?b? is innocent. That's why I accepted the case. - And the money? - When you can. I have started looking for her. No, Clim, nothing like that. Do you know the first thing you ask me B?b? when I see it? How are you.? And I answer that well, but he reads the answer in my eyes. I will see him later. What will my eyes tell you? He is screwed. - We will find her. - Where in China? Not so far. Why not? That pasma would give you money To leave. Where will you get the money? We are working. Yes, and you are going to chase her all over the world with that salary. Mom and I work. My sister cleans A teacher's house. You will never win for Pay that damn lawyer. He plays with people. Do you want me to burst here? You have no idea how it is. Please, get me out of here. Get me out of here. And the money what? Pasta! Have you ever had pasta? Well now don't start To worry about that. Damn cop. hopefully the balls dry. He wants you to worry about pasta and that your son rot there. The money doesn't take me away the dream. When I need it, I will steal it, Like the bourgeois. A child is going to be born And the road is not easy. Your son is the father of my daughter's baby. Don't forget that, Franck. As a child nothing scared him, except his mother, maybe. I didn't understand her And what could I do? Reproaching us We will not get him out of jail. I wish I had a son. From now on Mine is yours too. Look who I bring. A lot of time has passed. Daniel? Exactly, you are right. Do you know I leave Nora? Nora? You were always arguing. Yes, I remember, but ... So we do not find out of the tragic end of Dora. The children were told that they were shit and everything confirmed it. They were lying about the future, hopes, and love. they fought while they could. But they ended up falling Like flies Nora fell like a fly, and Daniel too. I unconsciously I had clung to B?b?. If not, it would have fallen too, along with B?b?. Are you really going to get married? It will seem weird but I only love her And to my wood. I don't know if it's weird, but you are lucky I do not have anything. I just got out of jail. Two years. Quiet, here you are sure. Do you know, Clim? It scares me Because he is scared. Do you believe? You never give Nothing account. Why do you sleep here? He is afraid of being alone, To see the pasmas. Daniel Corti carried this on. He says B?b? drew them. It is true. The paper was folded like this, and contained drug. Daniel is a camel. B?b? gave him the drawings. That is what Daniel says. We have never taken drugs. I know, Clim, but that his drawings appear In a drug case, it won't help. And the testimony of a camel ... Don't tell B?b?, It is no use worrying you. The objects collect dust, and the spirit too. And they don't know why They stick the dust. But if they have picked it up, it never goes away. My dust was that cop, I saw it everywhere. the century was ending, It had been worse than the previous ones. Even so, that cop was sure and was striding To purify the universe. He believed all his shit. I had never seen such eyes. they were like... I dont know... Eyes in which it is better not to exist. If they fall on you ... I can help her? You're like a splinter you irritate those eyes, and his only wish is to eliminate you Can i go with her? I talked with the mother for a while Her boyfriend's. The direction It was in his papers. I have good memory. For faces too. As I said, adopt children it's very good. But why go so far? Before you have to clean The misery itself. She agreed. She is a good woman. You also seem A good girl Do not be afraid of me. I do not have it. I am a legal type. Tell your boyfriend. You don't deserve to live in a cave. Goodbye. that same night, not far from here, They raped that woman. You're good? Calm down, it's nothing. I can not help you a lot now. But maybe I can help a little. I know what suffering is, And I know that one day is over. I would lie if I said That there is always a happy ending. Sometimes it is the opposite. You suffer so much that in the end There is no more suffering. And that is worse. But remember this: the things that are made They are what we decided to do. Further... You are not alone in this bed. There is another being nearby from your heart. And all of us, B?b? and everyone else, we count on you To bring it to this world. Only you can do that. Yes mom. Will I someday get this bum accompany us to the church, instead of staying in bed Sundays? I'm exhausted. I, every morning, I'm at the port at 6. Sunday is for rest. Go to the church Do you think it's a break? Do you not hear anything? The Lord calls you. He calls you. Can't you hear his call? Lord help me To bring this man to you Approach me Help me sir. It will help you. When you undress and you stay in balls. Come, come closer to the Lord. Oh Lord! Where does it hurt? Here? Here? Do you prefer with your tongue? Lord help me To bear this burden. We are in sin. We can never have children. Who knows? God could do a miracle. Help us! We wanted children. We spend a fortune on doctors. but we couldn't have them. It is my fault. No way. Yes, it is I who cannot. So we had to decide take another woman?s children. And that was very hard. She has gone crazy, Jo?l. She's crazy. She stopped loving herself, and above all to me. So he turned to the church In search of love. Now it is full of mercy. Piety. A merciless mercy. He condemns us all Because we are not like her. But... I still love her. I have dreamed that I was sculpting. You were in the wood, I had to free you. And there the dream is over. I woke up in the cell, alone, with snoring of the others And his stench I stink like them. I felt strong outside But here I am too young. With all those thoughts my sex hardens, and I stroke it without noticing. I force myself not to think about you, and my sperm comes out, splashing my hand, The belly, the balls. Then I open my eyes, and the cell falls on me, And I remember that I'm alone without you. I love you my love. I love you so sure Like your hair is growing I'm horrible. I'll take care of you. I also. I also. They can't with me. They can force me to anything, But they can't with me. I have an appointment, an appointment With a baby face. And I will come. Even in the shit And the stench, I'll be there I will always be there. I'm going out, and I will work the wood And the stone I have understood. I am not an artist. I work with my hands And my guts I am like my father and yours. You understand? One day I wondered what life it would lead that blind old man I saw every afternoon. What life would lead all those people with his sorrows and hidden joys? I was wondering what would happen to a pregnant woman If he suddenly got sick. Would people trample it to get off the bus? I feel chills. Every day I will be heavier And more sick. And baby count on me to get it out Even if I can't walk, I have to be strong. And every time I am less. I think I gain weight 100 kg per hour. I do not recognize myself. You have never been prettier. Thanks, you're very kind. If you had twelve, We would enter the record book. Come now! I can not imagine How will I be at the end. It does very strange things in there. If you could touch it ... Sometimes is Like Sleeping Beauty. I wonder If you are plotting a leak. Then suddenly It is everywhere. And it hurts a lot. But it is his way of speaking to me. It has moved? I'm not afraid anymore, Sister. I have been talking With the lawyer. - That woman doesn't lie. - What? Okay, yes. She repeats what the policeman told him. And surely he suggested It will wash immediately. I knew the sperm it wasn't from B?b?, and that would have proved His innocence. But she does not lie. For her, B?b? is the rapist. It was a nightmare. He will not go through that again. So he is screwed? Someone should talk to her. Lawyer? No he can not And he is also a man. I will go! No, you stay here. If B?b? doesn't see you It will drive you crazy. I have classes, work and I have to pressure the lawyer. - Just left... - Mom? It is the only one. And the trip money? I can see her? I have not seen. And the direction? Here it is. This is the address of the club where his brother Piet works, near Sarajevo. How old is he? 18. As his son-in-law Hopefully the old I got it. I'm glad you go, Marianne Another thing. B?b?'s mother and sister They are a problem. According to them, B?b? has always been a rogue. If the accusation gets to those respectable people ... Two old cretins! - It is not true? - His mother is right. They can be cretins But that does not change anything. Neither her pregnancy either. - Then there is the father ... - Franck is lovely. They will say that he is a drunk, A bad example for your son. He is not a drunk. He threatened the prosecutor being drunk - You? never baby? - What does it have to do? If you could not help your child imprisoned, He would also get drunk. Yes, but I would hire a lawyer that prevented me from doing nonsense That will harm my son. All good? Do you get me? Do you speak French? I'm looking for a taxi driver Let him speak French. Sorry sir. Do you speak French? I manage quite well. Can you take me to this address? Very good. God, how young I look! No one will believe that I have a daughter older and above pregnant. You don't look your age. You don't have the same paper here than at home You can dress any way you like, you will always be the rich tourist, because nobody knows you and you are alone. Life is easier in your country. No one will believe you here. No one will believe you come to save To the father of your future grandson. It is useless I. It won't do any good. What am I doing here? James. Is I called like that? Do you want more? Do you want your child to be born? Of course. Well, I'm sorry to tell you, But you will have to stop working. I know it's for the money, But it's tiring you If you keep it up, You will lose the son. If you lose it, you will lose B?b?. He will not want to continue living. And if you lose it, you will get lost And me. Everything will be lost. I'm not kidding. Yes I know. We have to take care of ourselves to each other. There are things that I can do: make money. And things you can do. I can not have the child. If I could I would do it. He would do anything for you. I know, dad. And there are things you can only Do you for your great B?b?. In agreement? It's a kid and is going through things that not even an adult would endure. And he has nothing but you. I'm a man, I know what I mean. I know that young people You don't like to talk to us like that. I was also young. Ok dad. Bring us that boy safe and sound, and we will get B?b?. I promise. Do you promise? Yes I promise. Finish the chocolate, It will cool down. And it will weigh you in the stomach. I have to see someone, I will not be late. Clear. French? The person you are going to see ... French? He speaks French? I don't know, I have no idea.
