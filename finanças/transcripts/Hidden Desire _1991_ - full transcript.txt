I believe you can manage Let me tell you When I was 15 years old dad had me to be assistant in the company from office boy to be supervisor I've worked for a decade but people outside think I live on my father in fact, I have my own ways! I must prove I am able Eight companies rush for the small tobacco transaction we'll surely win if you make a plan Sure I'll answer the phone Hello, speaking I'm no free, call you back another day, bye Tin Tin, shall we eat? Aren't you busy? Yeah, to eat with you I saw him seeing you back, sorry I worked late tonight so he invited me to dinner You know, that bastard Charlie has cheated much money from the company but we have no proof, or he must go to jail I know you all work late I did call him up so the caller was you Yes, maybe he prefers eating with you Why quit? You aren't happy here? David, I won't say any more You'll know after reading this Though she didn't explain I know it is all because of Joey What's in your mind, David? You won't eat with me? Sorry, I want to be alone you might leave now I know you don't like me, you prefer Tin Tin Tell me, you like her better than me Do you? Tell me Don't ask, I don't know Candy left me from that minute then I received letter from Tin Tin David, I have arrived in US Life is not bad I think time cure all wounds Though I leave you this minute yet, time flies In future, maybe I will forget you and you will forget me too thanks for giving me a good memory, Tin Tin. So lonely to be alone? You? Alone too? Where's your girlfriend? Where? She's left Can't believe you are all alone I now indulge myself to fill my loneliness then I went out with Joey Who do you prefer, Tin Tin or me? Why do you ask? Real love is like that song Smoke Gets In Your Eyes, no one knows Joey is a woman of lust and can make all men kneel before her she brings me a world of lust I nearly got lost in love but such sexual excitement is only temporary so I decided to leave her then I met the last woman in HK, Yoshiko my company met the failure at last and was bought up by "Ota", a Japanese Company "Ota" president is Taro Mitsuda and Yoshiko is his only daughter Taro sent Yoshiko to HK to take over To maintain my business, I got into affair with Yoshiko I appreciate the working efficiency of Hong Kong people I have no experience, so you must teach me more Stop the politeness, you should give me opinion I must say there's much to improve but I'll have someone sent here form Japan I hope you don't mind We can surely work well Good cooperation Thanks for seeing me home You're welcome, good night Goodbye David, are you free tomorrow? I hope you can see around HK with me Sure. I'll pack you up tomorrow, bye Bye Thank you for accompanying me all day. How do you like HK? Very beautiful, like Tokyo but much busier than Tokyo And you? You're from US, how do you like Hong Kong? At first I was not used to, but now OK I feel fine as I live with compatriots Foreigners look down on Chinese abroad I had much dispute with foreigners so I came back to work in HK As men live in civilization it's happier to be in his own land I don't understand why Hong Kong people rush to emigrate HK is like this Everyone here wants to leave Hong Kong but people outside want to come back to HK I am the one who rushes back here What in HK attracts you? As I like Chinese culture I majored in Chinese Literature in University then knowing I had to come to HK I started to learn Cantonese I speak pretty well now? Very well, even better than I do I want to invite you to dance Terrific My car is over there, I'll see you home Let's go How are you? Had a good sleep? Don't know, I didn't sleep a wink I figured the way we danced once I closed my eyes If you like, I can dance with you every night You lie Don't you believe? We shall start tonight Don't just promise me easily As I fear you will be heart-broken You mustn't think afar My dad has come, he wants to see you I did mention to you many will come from Japan in fact it is his idea, he wanted to change you to but I highly recommend you to him I've also told him the sentiment between us so he wants to see you - Welcome -How are you? Please be seated Yoshiko, you're very pretty today Dad, don't laugh at me You're most happy today It's different when you have a boyfriend David, I've read your project Very good I intend to have a total change of company Yoshiko should have told you this? Yes, she has OK, David, I take you as my family I should reveal my plan to you I intend to have Japanese as all seniors as you are buddy of Yoshiko you should become Japanese But Chinese and Japanese are the same The Nanjing Massacre is just a distant statement, I don't believe it. I hope you don't believe it. You should think over for the sake of the company I know dad's request is too much I won't compromise anyway Not even for me? Sorry, I'm not the kind of guy you're looking for I'll resign tomorrow I'm leaving - Hello -David David, are you mad with me? I want to see you will you come out, David? Sorry, I should force you Tomorrow we'll see him and convince him you mustn't leave me for this Dad Yoshiko, why so happy today? Sit down Try the Japanese Tea Ceremony Please Which is better, Japanese or Chinese style? They both have advantages Yes, it's is very true why do you come all the way here? Dad, don't force him Must David become a Japanese? David, you feel ashamed to become a Japanese! I don't find it a shame but it's a shame to betray oneself Have you thought about your future? I do hope to work on in the company but I hope to be Chinese more you will refuse even if I want you to, right? Right OK, I admire you, and can even promise you, but we Matsuta family has a rule our family business must not given to outsiders If you really love Yoshiko, you should marry here at once Once married, you're our family, and you'll become the President At this moment, and you'll become the President She is very lovable I can have my own career with her she is very obedient to me I find no reason of not marrying her but I am at a total loss why don't you come in? I'll show you something Sure wait for me a while David Am I pretty? I'll wear kimono on our wedding, like it? You're the most beautiful Japanese girl I've ever seen I like it very much Yoshiko is the goddess for all men I can't deny living her but such loving is for her beauty, for money I'm betraying myself if I marry her Once again, I've decided to leave I know I did harm to Yoshiko Maybe it's magic spell of love I may regret my whole life but I have never seen Yoshiko after that we are two of a kind we depend on each other, believe me, we'll work out Cheers Miss Yoshiko, I do admire you Japanese The Nanjing Massacre is too exaggerated How can war not kill people? Our two companies can surely Let's sign on the contract Hope we cooperate well Come on, cheers you're feeling unwell? I feel faint Let me see you home Be careful what place is this? Everywhere is the same what are you doing? No No No, leave me alone No No David David Cry? You thought he took you as girlfriend? He was fooling you!
