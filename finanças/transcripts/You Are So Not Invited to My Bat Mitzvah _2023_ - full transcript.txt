All across the world, and maybe ever since the beginning of time, different cultures had different ways of celebrating a kid coming of age. There's the quinceañera. There's Sweet 16. There's also something called land diving. My dad told me that in the Brazilian Amazon, there's this thing called a bullet ant initiation where fire ants crawl all over your hands and bite you. And if you can handle the pain, you're ready to be a man. I told him if he thinks that sounds bad, try being a girl in middle school. Everyone has their own thing. And we have ours. Va-y'chal Moshe... At a Bar or Bat Mitzvah, when you're 13, you step before friends, family, and elders of the temple and read from the Torah. Then, there's usually a party. All right, mishpachah, please say hello to our newest and most fabulous adult, Stacy Friedman! Your Bat Mitzvah is the first day of your adult life, and everyone knows an iconic adult life hinges on how it starts. ♪ I don't care, I love it ♪ The theme. - The food. - Can I get one? The entrance video. It all tells a story. Who do I want to be? Will I have amazing lifelong friends like Lydia Rodriguez Katz? Nothing before that day matters because that was the old you, the kid you. Now you're an adult. So who cares if two years ago you accidentally peed yourself during a field trip and had to get a secret dry pants delivery from your awesome older sister Ronnie? This is a hypothetical situation of course. ♪ I love it ♪ Go Stacy! That's my sister! And what better way to kick off adulthood than with the hottest guy in seventh grade? ♪ I love it ♪ ♪ You keep me under your spell ♪ ♪ You keep me under your spell ♪ ♪ You keep me under your spell ♪ Andy, what are you doing? Stacy, I've loved you since the first time I saw you in the temple's Purim Pageant. You were the finest Queen Esther I ever laid eyes on. Is it okay if I officially signify me being your boyfriend by giving you a kiss? Consent given, Andy Goldfarb. Stacy! Stacy, we're gonna be late. Let's go. I know you can hear me. One second, I'm flossing like you tell me to! - Now I'm gurgling. - Well, hurry up! - You too, Ronnie! - I'm ready! You always say that. Never ready. - Ugh. Fine you got me. I'm not ready. - Yankees are winning. That's what you're wearing? Yeah, I don't even know who this kid is. I'm not gonna wear a suit. It's a junior high friend. We have to get to know those parents too. I don't want to get to know 'em. I liked when they were little. All we had to know was them and the trampoline park guy. Ronnie, we're gonna be late! I'll be ready when Stacy's ready, Mom. It's all good. Hey, Andy, of course I'll share a matzo ball soup with you. Hi, Andy. I like your yarmulke. I didn't know you were going to the Bat Mitzvah tonight, that's cool. Honey, what are you looking for? I can't find my earring. Oh, good luck. Keep looking, baby. Keep looking. Take your time. Stacy! Sorry, I'm coming! Those are cool. - Mom will never let you wear them, though. - She won't even notice. And if she does, I'll put on a sad show for Dad. Oh, she'll notice. She'll hate them. And Dad will feel bad, but ultimately be too afraid to stand up to Mom. I've known them longer than you. Um, excuse me, what are those things on your feet? Lydia's mom bought us each a pair, so we could twin. What's twin? Wearing the same thing. It's very seventh grade. Take them off. You look like a stripper. - Mom, you can't say that. - Yeah, Mom. You're gonna get cancelled. Oh boy. Take them off or lose your phone. Oh. No, you can't. Just take them off. Everyone in the car. Thirty seconds or there's going to be no food left at this thing. You're the one who's not ready. We're ready. - I don't know where my earring is. - Babe, did you look everywhere? Honestly? 'Cause if you look hard enough, you can find it. Why would you do that to me? Because I knew the girls needed more time. I also... I don't want to go to this thing at all. - You guys are the worst. - Yeah. I love you. Okay. Come on, Mom, just let her wear the shoes. It's not fair to Lydia to make her wear them by herself. Okay. You're going to hate them in two minutes. You're welcome. Thank you. Love you. - Whoa. Ow! - Stacy! I'm coming! Ugh, fine. Move, child! Coming, sorry! - Oh yeah! - Oh, nice job. Taking after Dad with the dress clothes and sneakers. Comfort always comes first, sweetie. - There she is! - She's limping. Hi, sweetheart! - Hi, Lyd! - Lydia, Lydia encyclopedia. Hi, guys! Nice shoes. You look super cute, Lydia. Oh, thanks, Ron Ron. Stacy and I are twinning. We heard. Hmm. Not anymore. - You took yours off. - I got you. - Oh, thank you. I couldn't feel my feet. - Mom and Dad know we're taking you? Well, I told my mom, and then she told Dad's lawyer, so we're good to go. Nice! Ugh! Dad, can you turn this song off? It's embarrassing. Why is it embarrassing? No one's around to hear it. Oh my God! You're humiliating me! All right! I'll turn it off. Jesus. I turned it off, guys! What are we still upset about? Their watching sad videos to see who can cry first. You're trying to cry. That is so bizarre. Ugh! You're so freaking good at this game. I hate it. Everybody in this house needs a shrink. Yeah, you need two. Ten. That's nice. Everyone be normal. We're going to temple. Here's your music. Make some noise, mishpachah! Woohoo! It's Devin's B'nai Mitzvah! They're becoming an adult. Let's hear it for Devin! We've been pushing all the teachers to assign more homework. If we want to prepare our kids for this world, we gotta start 'em early. India's been kicking our ass. - I'm always telling my son, Marvin... - I'm sorry. Can I interrupt you for one second? I think this is on behalf of the table. We came here to enjoy chicken and fish tonight and maybe have a few drinks, so could you stop talking? ♪ I want your stupid love ♪ Thank you. Wow! This is such a classic. Have you watched Leprechaun in the Hood? Dude, that's a masterpiece. We know. We've seen it. It was awful. Can you just let us watch our movie? Bye! That hurt. - We've seen that? - No. Okay, I love this Carnivale theme, but your Candyland theme is gonna be the best of the year. Oh, until your New York theme puts the entire school to shame! If my parents let me have it. Did your dad talk to DJ Schmuley yet? Let me hear you scream, "DJ Schmuley is my king!" DJ Schmuley is my king! - He's already been booked. We got it! - Sweet! Looking nice, ladies! - Hi, guys. - Hi. Can you believe we're becoming adults this year? - No. - Yeah. My mom actually let me shave my legs this afternoon. First time. So magical. Oh, I'm so proud of you, Nikki! It burns so bad right now, like somebody wiped wasabi all over my shins. Oh. Oh my God. Why do Kym, Anya, and Megan always look so cool? Are those birds rescued? - Say what? - They better be. - They scare me. - Yeah, you know what else is scary? Nikki's mom is allowing Ronnie and Zaara to drink alcohol! One, two, three. Woo! Okay, let me hide those. Yeah, she's trying to be like a cool mom. It's really weird. Let's go! Oh my God, Andy Goldfarb looks so cute tonight. ♪ Let's go ♪ Do you realize that one day he will be mine, and you will have a cool boyfriend too, and then we'll have a joint wedding and move to adjoining lofts in Tribeca? In Taylor Swift's building? - Yeah! - Yeah! I'm gonna talk to him. - What? - I'm ready. You should, Stace. Yeah, you got this. Come with me, please. - Yeah. - Let's go. Go, go, go. You got this. Gang way! Hey, wait for me! - No! You're embarrassing me. - Yes! ♪ I don't eat, I don't sleep ♪ ♪ I do nothing but think of you ♪ ♪ You keep me under your spell ♪ ♪ You keep me under your... ♪ Hey, Stacy. I like your kicks. Andy, smile! Finish him! Why would Mateo do that? That was so uncalled for. Oh, sorry. Completely. Sorry. Why does Andy hang out with that Italian exchange student anyway? I think he's Ecuadorian. Whatever. I heard he has a girlfriend back home. She's in college. Um, no. I think that's, like, illegal. Oh my God! - Sorry. - What's wrong with you? - Why would you do that? So embarrassing. - I'm sorry. All right, everybody, make some noise! ♪ If you don't wanna see me Dancing with somebody ♪ ♪ If you wanna believe... ♪ Come on, let's dance, everybody! Come on! ♪ Don't show up, don't come out ♪ ♪ Don't start caring about me now ♪ - Let me hear you scream, Schmu... - Ley! - Schmu... - Ley! - Schmu, Schmu... - Ley! Why does everybody like this idiot? - He's the best! - The best. You've been officially Schmulitized! Thank you family for joining us today. Let me take you all on a journey. Picture this. My entrance video starts... Which, as we know, sets the tone for the entire Bat Mitzvah. Mm-hmm. - Ugh, Ronnie! - Girls, come on. Anyway, I descend the stairs of a private yacht on the Hudson River to cheers and fireworks. Whoa. Then! Oh, who's that zipping by on a jet ski? Why that's international recording artist Olivia Rodrigo. Wait, how we gonna pay for this? Oh, we have ideas. They... they got ideas, honey. Okay. No. Wait. No. The old guy was supposed to be for your dad. Oh no. Just keep going. - There. - Okay. Oh, this is amazing. - Shut up, Ronnie. - No, you shut up. I'll kill you, Ronnie. Not if I stab you first! Oh, that's... that's nice. Oh my God, this is important! I'm becoming a freaking woman, everyone! Okay, woman. All you should worry about right now is your mitzvah project and practicing your Haftarah. - Mm-hmm. - That's not important! I mean, it is important to you and other old people and God and stuff. But to me, the party is important. If this doesn't go well, I could end up like Kate Kossman. You are not gonna end up like Kate Kossman. Who's Kate Kossman? Oh, she had this terrible medieval themed Bat Mitzvah called Kate Kossman Knights, not realizing the initials spelled out KKK. Yeah, no, I could see that being a problem. Okay. So now, she just sits alone in the cafeteria sewing friendship bracelets for literally no one because she has no friends. That sounds a little dramatic. Oh, so you think you shouldn't be punished for promoting the KKK. Wow, Mom, didn't realize you supported racism. Oh boy. Hear me out. You're always saying how my Bat Mitzvah determines the rest of my life. And I think Dua Lipa would make my life perfect. No. No famous pop stars, no yachts, no sailboats even. That's so unfair! Ronnie got a baked potato bar at hers! Listen, when I got Bar Mitzvahed, we had a party in Grandma's basement. We all split, like, this giant matzo ball. That was the fun. You know what the theme was? Being Jewish. Just practice your prayers and write your speech already. Oh, I've been doing that Mr. Friedman. It's all covered. You're writing Stacy's speech? - You know I'm not good at writing. - English is her worst subject. It's really bad. - Stacy, that is so not okay. - It's fine. She's gonna do my entrance video. I know she'll crush it. Don't worry. Can I at least have a virgin mojito bar? You can have a ball pit. Oh my God, Dad. That's for kids! I've had my period for seven months now! Wait, Stacy. That's a long period, sweetheart! You know what? I'm gonna head out. I'll drive you. Love you. See you in the morning. Don't worry, Dad. It'll be okay. She's growing up so fast. It's crazy. I'm drinking now. I tried it the other day. I didn't like it. We're good. Va-y'chal Mosh... Va-y'chal... Dear God, what's up? Stacy Friedman here, but I guess you already know that. And I guess you already know what I'm going to say. But just to be super safe, I'm going to say it anyway. I would really, really appreciate it if I could have an amazing Bat Mitzvah. And I know I need to do my mitzvah project. But isn't a mitzvah project supposed to be giving back in a way that represents me? Which is why I don't know what to do. I mean, I'm not popular. I'm not a loser. I don't know who I am. But I do know, if I have a kick-ass Bat Mitzvah, doors would open, and I can have a fab life on my own terms. No. No famous pop stars. You can have a ball pit. A ball pit? Lydia's gonna get everything she asked for. Even a Twizzlers station for me. I'm starting to worry Mom and Dad don't get it, and the whole thing's gonna suck. - You had her phone the whole time? - No, she was lying. - The audacity. - The monster. Yeah. - Can we sit outside? It's a nice day. - No. I mean, I definitely could use some color. - Yeah, it's true. - Is that Tory Burch? Oh no, it's Walmart. I got this and a water bottle for only $12. I was talking to her. M-me? Your skirt. Uh, yeah, it is Tory Burch. My mom is trying to spend all my dad's money before the next court date. I'm pretty sure I saw Hailey Bieber wearing the exact same one. Oh cool. Okay. Bye. That was weird. - I love and hate them at the same time. - Yeah. What just happened? ♪ Wait a minute ♪ ♪ I think I left my conscience On your front-door step ♪ ♪ Whoa ♪ So get this. I heard Megan's doing her mitzvah project next weekend. She's passing out sunscreen at Coachella. - What? Wow. - So cool. Guys, I have to come up with something amazing. This is so much pressure. How long do you think it takes to become a social activist influencer on TikTok? Uh, six months? Too long. You know what? We just need to chill our brains. What are you doing Saturday? My mom's out of town this weekend. Why? You gonna throw a party? A dork party? What if I did? Well, I mean, my dad's out of town. Now, you could actually throw a party. You could invite the whole seventh grade and not exclude anybody. Oh, come on. Wouldn't it be fun to exclude people instead of being excluded for once? Heads up! Ay dios mío. Stace, Stace, Stace, Stace? Are you okay? Oh shit. That doesn't look good. You have grass in your hair. Stacy. Are you okay? That's my bad! You good? Yeah. Sorry about that. Have some water. Oh my God. That was perfect. He went... And then you went. You guys are meant to be. Hey, are your legs okay, Nikki? They're fine, Mateo. Just relax. Really? Oh, by the way, Dad invited the dry cleaner to the Bat Mitzvah, Stacy. What? No, that's so unfair. The ratio to old people to normal people is already so unbalanced. Why is that kid Mateo going to Hebrew school? Maybe he wanted to convert and take some Jewish holidays off? You gonna invite him, Stace? Mateo? No, I barely know him. You know, if you invite Mateo, Andy might come. Have fun learning! Love you! Oh shit! Are you on dru... Take me to your best friend's house Goin' round this roundabout, oh yeah - Thank you. - Good job, guys. - Manishmah. - Hi. - Shalom, you two. - Shalom. Oh, this looks really good. I am not that creative... I was not good at arts and crafts, like, at all. - I like your outfit, Ashley. - Thank you. Oh yeah, it's really cute. Look who's coming out of the make out closet. Oh my God, were they hooking up in there? How do they not get caught? There's literally so many people around. Would you believe when I was your age, I was in a Jewish rock and roll band? We called ourselves Exodus because Genesis was already taken. I'm sorry, Aaron, am I boring you? What? No... I was listening, Cantor Jerry. Stace, Lyd! - You look so cute. You guys good? - Yes. - The pole! - Pole! Oh, wait, how's your Torah portion going? It's like 6,000 pages long. Why did my parents pick the third week of August? But mine's literally, like, a minute and a half long. Thank you, June 10th! Chop-chop, ladies! Curtain's up in five! I like to think of Hebrew school as a little performance I give. Your prayer book is the playbill, and I'm the star, cutie-pops. Giving you a bit of the ole razzle-dazzle. You know what I'm saying? Kidding. Come one, class is starting. Let's go! Rabbi Rebecca! - Can we please have snacks? - You want some latkes and gefilte fish? She's insane. I know. I love her. "And I'm the star, cutie-pops, razzle-dazzle." - Very nice. - Very good. Thank you. Thank you very much. - Is she serious? Oh my God. - I know, right? I really want a cloud. Like, I want to taste a cloud. - You want what? - I want to taste a cloud. I want to taste a cloud. That's all. - It seems... - Yo. You good, bro? Yeah. Why? Uh, your head from earlier. Head injuries are no joke. One time I barfed at soccer from a concussion. Did you barf? No. I didn't. Tight. - All right, shabbat shalom! - Shabbat shalom. How's everyone feeling? We having the time of our lives right now? You guys start your mitzvah projects yet? - No. - Yeah. No? It's the most important part of this whole thing. It's when you do something menschie for your community, for society at-large. What? You guys don't care about society at-large? - No. - Yeah. All right, how about we pick up where we left off with our old buddy, David. Remember him? Homeboy was about to get his groove on with the foxy Bathsheba even though she was married to someone else. What a snake David is! You a snake, Aaron? N-no. You ever pull something like that? Cheat on your wife? - M-me? - Dude, I'm messing around with you. Relax! You're sweating, my goodness. You're not a snake, Aaron. You're awesome. Look at that arm hair and mustache coming in strong. Baruch HaShem, Aaron. Let's go. So I told the sales lady, "I'll take one in each color." And she said, "Are you getting a divorce?" And I said, "How'd you guess?" That's really funny, Mom. Hey, can you let me bring over some people on Saturday? Oh sure. Like a playdate? A playdate? Mom, I'm 13. Please don't call it a playdate. My dad's calling me. Hi! Hey! Stacels. Hey, I'm at the store right now. Mommy told me you need some, uh, tampons... - But I'm not sure what size you use... - Stop. Get whatever. There's a lot of whatever to choose from. Do pads. I don't care. What kind of flow do you got going? - Uh, heavy flow situation? - Heavy. - Oh my God. - A light flow? Or extra chunky? I... I... I got confused. I'm getting peanut butter also. - I mean... - Mommy said it was a high-alert situation? That you might have to sleep in the bathtub? I'll drop 'em off in your room immediately. Oh my God. Love you. Bye. "Hey, Lyd, it's Kym. Having people over now." "Pull up if you're free." Wow. Um, what do I say? Do you want to go? No. But, I mean, I should respond. Yeah. For sure. Uh, if you want to go, I don't care. I just think they're awful, but it's your choice. - Let me ask if you can come. - No. Please don't do that. Yeah, I'm gonna ask. Doing it right now. Look, I just did it. Whoops. Sorry. Oh my God! Okay, Mom, can you drop us off at Kym Chang-Cohen's house, please? - Wait. Can you stop by my place first? - Sure. - Period. - You gonna ask if Tara and Nikki can come? Oh. Oh. Um, I mean, I don't think so. Bringing three people would be, like, a lot. - Yeah, I agree. - Yeah. You can't go now. Okay. Hurry. - Hi, Ron. - Hi. - Should I wear a jacket with this? - No. Where are you going? Kym Chang-Cohen's. Oh wow. First rule of going to a cool kid's house, don't disagree. Don't get too excited. - Got it. Thanks. - Cool. Oh, Dad left pads on your bed. They're enormous. I almost thought they were pillows. Are you joking? That's funny. Oh my God. Remember. Don't disagree. Don't get too excited. So, Lydia, any crushes? Oh, uh... No, not really. There's not a lot of options for boys in our grade. You know? Oh, so you only like boys? Uh, I think so. Don't worry. Some of us are straight too. Cool. I don't disagree. Yeah, Stacy, what about you? Who do you like? Uh, no one, really. Uh, people are coming to my house tomorrow if you want to come. Nothing big. Sounds chill. You guys have to come. It'll be freaking amazing! Her house is so cool. I mean, it'll be a'ight. Uh, anyways, we should probably wash this off before we go. - Uh, we have to change before we leave. - Where are we going? To the ledge. - No way. - We'll be careful. I don't want to die. - We have to. We can't disagree. - What? Don't act excited! Andy will be there. Come on, Lydia, can't you do this for me? I already got you invited here. Isn't that enough? I didn't mean it like that. You guys coming or what? Yeah, I'm down. ♪ It's irresistible ♪ ♪ I'm so stuck on you ♪ Ugh, my mom said I have to wait a year before I can get lip filler.

It's, um... it's still on her body, so... Yeah, we love that. And I'm not barfing, so, yeah. Uh, anyways... What's up? I'm Andy. Uh, I know. We, uh... we go to Hebrew school together. Lydia. We do? Yeah. I dare one of you guys to jump in! Come on! Let's go. Jump off the ledge, Aaron? You'd break both legs on impact and your spine. Yeah, I heard Melissa Quinto's cousin jumped, and she now has to text with her nose, so, no. Looks like it might be fun. Hey, I'd jump if I didn't have my contacts in. Oh, I'd be happy to hold them for you, Aaron. Oh shit. You can't see. I'll do it. What? You'd jump in? That... that's sick. Let's see it. Okay. - No way, no way. - Oh shit.

Just take my sweatshirt. Not a big deal? That was humiliating! Andy looked at me like... You're a badass! That's all anyone was thinking. No, whatever. I'm over him. Call it. - Stacy, think this through. - I did. Call it. 5:23. Stacy Friedman's crush on Andy Goldfarb has ended. Time of death, 5:23 p.m. Okay, let's just go. No, you just stay with your new friends. What? What are you talking about? Oh my God, stop! You didn't have my back. Just admit it! You stop. I told you not to jump. I didn't even want to be here. Only because you already got them to come to your party! - You're being so dramatic right now! - You're such a wannabe right now! I'm freezing. I'm gonna go. Wow, Stacy. I can't even. I can't even, even more. What you gonna do, sweets? Sending out the invitations today. I have to get my hair dyed... Oh, will you call DJ Schmuley? He's asking for a green room and per diem. And he may or may not have hit on me. Well, I may or may not punch him in the face. - Yeah, okay. - Let me handle Schmuley. So, you, I'm going to the movies. You want to come? Too weird being at a movie theater alone with my dad. Okay, you never want to be with me again? What are you gonna do all day? Zaara's coming over, and we're going to online shop and then take a nap outside. And that's not weird to you? We're tired from frickin' school all week! Honey, go have quality time with your younger daughter who still loves you. - Yeah. - Okay? Have a good day. This one scares me. - Miss you already, Daddy! - Do ya? Great. Oh my God! - We ready in there, buddy? - One second, Dad! Don't do this to me. Let's go! Coming! Bubie, I'm psyched. I'm psyched about the popcorn. Lots of butter. Lots of anger after I finish it. - Lots of oil on my face. - Dad, can I skip the movies? You wanna skip the movie? How come? You don't want to be seen with me either? No, no, no. I just need to talk to Lydia. Can you drop me at her house? Sure, buddy. What's the matter? Something bugging you? It'll be fine. Whatever it is. Here. Don't tell your mother. Have some coffee.

Oh, I heard he touched her underboob in PE this morning. - Tara... - It's fine, guys. Junior high gossip. Never ends. Okay, well, when did that start? Her party this weekend. She had the party? Guess so. She didn't invite us. No surprise, because they were awfully chummy laughing at my near-death experience at the ledge. You guys went to the ledge with Andy? Oh, it's just the ledge. It was last minute. Hmm. - Come on, Tara. Let's go. - Yeah. Okay, today we're going to be talking about tikkun olam. Does anyone know what that means? Kym! If God exists, then how do you explain climate change? It's actually an amazing question. Um... Yeah, and why can't straight people get on gay TikTok? It's way funnier.

Seema! What did Rabbi Rebecca say about being on your phone? Right? Aaron knows what I'm talking about. Come on, dude. - Yup, Baruch HaShem, Aaron. - Yes, sir. All right, what's going on, young lady? You used to be such a good, respectful kid. Now, you're on your phone. You're not practicing your portion. Talk to me, sis. What's crappenin'? Do you know what your portion is about? Do you understand Ki Tisa? Yeah. Lots of golden calf talk and stuff like that. Yeah, but it's also about becoming your own individual person. It's about taking responsibilities for your mistakes. You know, grown-up stuff? Let me take a wild guess. You haven't started your mitzvah project yet either, huh? I'm narrowing it down. Seema, I'm telling you, the sooner you do your mitzvah, which is a good deed, a commandment by the way, the sooner you'll find things falling into place. Wait, so, if I do a mitzvah, God will reward me? - No, not reward... - And he'll give me what I want? Well, I definitely did not say that. No, thank you, Rabbi. You helped me so much. I gotta get to work. Wait. No, no, no! Gotta start my journey, Rabbi Rebecca! Can you get me a Gatorade? - Hey, uh, can I sit here? - Sure. Hey. You wouldn't happen to know why people keep asking me if they can floss their teeth with my nipple hair today, do you, Stacy? Uh, no. You know, seventh grade is hard enough without people pointing and laughing at me whenever I walk down the hall, screaming out, "Here, comes spider-nips." Better than, "Here comes Aunt Flow and the Blood-Pads!" But that really happened, Stacy. - How do I know your nipples are hairless? - Because you do! Why are you dating him? I thought it was just one kiss? And stop doing Rabbi Rebecca impressions to Andy. That's my impression, you freaking ripoff artist! And I'm the star, cutie-pops, razzle-dazzle! That sounds so much like her! Do Cantor Jerry. I don't know how. Boo! - Um, uh, chicken? - Ronnie? Ronnie. Can you help with my mitzvah project? I need to get on that ASAP. I'm kind of in the middle of something. Oh, chicken parmesan! Correct. Honey, why don't you and Lydia do something with the homeless or volunteer at the animal shelter? Cause it's my Bat Mitzvah and I'm not doing my project with Lydia. It's a statement about me. Stace, that's what you said about the egg roll piñata. - And the dress. - And your hair. Shut up, Zaara. Why are you always here? Hey. Ugh! You guys don't get what this means. Nobody does. Biggest drama queen in the room? - Correct. - Oh my God! You're not funny. Girls, leave her alone.

I was showing them how to queef. Wha... You better not show this to anyone. I swear to God, if you show this to anyone, I literally will murder you. You understand this? You understand that? - I wouldn't do that. - Okay, good. Love you. Stop, I'm being serious. This could be dangerous. They're both nuts together. Stacy, stop smothering Lydia. Aw, that's nice!

Are you excited about your Bar Mitzvah? Yeah, it should be all right. That's dope. Yeah, but Lydia, she's being all salty 'cause she has to miss some dumb dance competition to go. Ugh. I hate how competitive she is. It's just like, why can't it be about the dancing? Well, I mean, I play soccer, and soccer is pretty competitive. Uh, well, soccer's a sport. Dance is an art. Facts.

Uh, we're gonna go get some boba and then watch a movie, Evil Dead 2, if you wanna come. - Yeah, just... - Oh, thank God. Yes! What happened to your armpits? Oh, I shaved this morning. It did not go well. It's fine! I didn't need you anyway. Don't you love puzzles? Puzzles are corny. Facts. I have a question. Is Lydia a good kisser? She's a'ight. A'ight? Huh. Probably because you were her first kiss. No, she's told me she's kissed a bunch of guys before. At camp? Yes. Does her tight-lipped technique suggest a high level of experience? Nah, it's like she thinks she's kissing a stuffed animal or something. Plus, every time I try to move my hand, she starts laughing, says she's mad ticklish. You have the patience of a saint. A Jewish saint. True. Twenty points for me. Get it, Grandma. Want a picture of you and your grandma to prove to your moms you're here? Uh, yeah. That's low-key a good idea. Okay. - Yeah, Grandma. - Hilarious. I have to prove to Rabbi Rebecca I'm here too. I'm volunteering for my mitzvah project. - That's what's up. - Here, I'll send it to you. - For sure. - Oh, shoot. I just sent you more pics. - Just ignore. - Andy Goldfarb. Nice. - That one's way too big on me. - Okey-dokey. Well, why don't you try the strapless one? So, how's Lydia's entrance video coming along? I finished it this weekend. Great! No. Why is it a no? Just... it's just a no. Well, okay, then try the last one on. No, that's the worst one! Well, just try it! Oh my God. It's so ugly, Mom. Maybe it'll look good when it's on you. Oh. You know what? I like this. I look like the lady at school that pulls kids out of class when their parents get into car accidents. How often does that happen? Can we please get this dress? Come on. It's the dream dress. It costs more than our house. Okay, so wear the cheap dress in front of God. Got it. It's not cheap. It's reasonable. That's what every kid wants to hear on the most important day of their life. "Wow, Stacy, you look so reasonable." You know what? This is a nice, temple-friendly, well-priced dress. And... No. Don't say it. Please, Mom. Please, I beg you. - We're gettin' it. - Oh my God! You're ruining me! So ugly, Mom. - So, is this, like, a swipe or a chip? - Yeah, it's a chip. Good? Okay. Wait, did I take it out too soon? Why? We could color coordinate. We're not color coordinating, Mom. We're not doing that. - You want to ruin me? - [Gabi Okay. No. It looks like something the counselor at school wears, Mom. - Okay, okay. - Please, I'm not wearing that. - Yeah, I got that app too. - Eli! - What? - What do you think? What? Uh, Rudy, hold on a second. I'm at a family function or something, uh... Yeah, that dress is gorgeous, kiddo. Only the best. Papi, you don't even know which one we're talking about. It's the prettiest one. Just like you, pumpkin. Twenty-three skidoo! Wee! Okay, yeah, I think you gave me a good price. Mom? Mom, can we go? Yeah, okay. Take the dress. - Thank you. - Okay. So great. We got a great deal. Where's Daddy? I don't remember... - No. - Gabi! Bree?! Lydia! Lydia's here... Oh my God! I haven't seen you in forever! Hi!

It's so great to see you. How you doing? Terrific. We're getting divorced. Oh yeah. I'm... I heard. I'm so sorry. I'm not. I'm on six dating apps. Six? Wow, that's a lot. Andy broke up with me. Hmm. Sorry to hear that. You were the perfect couple. He said he couldn't deal with the ticklishness or the closed mouth kissing. Sucks for you, I guess. Said he heard I lied about kissing boys in camp. Well, you did lie. So... See you at temple? - See you at temple. - Okay. Anyhoo. Gonna go. - Happy shopping! - Yeah! - Bye, Eli! Enjoy those dating apps. - Yeah. - Bye, Stacy. - See ya! Come on, honey. What's that mom's name again? Bree. Are you kidding me? You need to get your fat head in the game, Eli.

This is supposed to be the most important day of your life, and you're not taking it seriously at all. You haven't even done your mitzvah project yet. I did my mitzvah project. I volunteered at the retirement home. So you could do a mitzvah, or so you could flirt with a boy? How did you know that? Let's just say there's a wonderful woman there, Mrs. O'Leary, who wishes to convert to Judaism, and you never brought her bookies! Yeah, you're not the only one who's amazing at impressions. I'll do better. Let me take off my "rabbi hat" for a second and put on my "tough love hat." If you don't shape up, your Bat Mitzvah is gonna be cancelled, sis. And that's the way the hamantaschen crumbles. Capisce? Yes, we understand, Rabbi Rebecca. She doesn't really even deserve a second chance. We thank you for that. Mm-hmm.

He didn't take a breath. No. Hey. We don't slam doors in this house. - Dad, I need a break. - Well, welcome to being an adult. And welcome to being Jewish. We don't get breaks. Oh my God! Stop! Kissing a boy in a temple? You know how disrespectful that is? Every time you walk into that synagogue, you are declaring to everyone and God, "I'm Jewish, and I am part of this!" Well, maybe I don't want to be! Yes, you do! I was born into God's kingdom! Yeah? Well, God wants you out right now! How's that? - I hate you! - You don't mean that. Wow, I never said that to him, and I was nuts. You hate me?! I do. You're a jerk, and you won't let me have a mojito bar. Gabi! Hi! That's why we fought the Nazis? So you could have a mojito bar? Is this a bad time? - Um, no. What's... what's going on? - Are you nuts? Well, Stacy was supposed to do that video for Lydia's Bat Mitzvah. Oh, yeah, yeah. Of course, right. Get out of my room! Stop ruining my life! - Anyways... - I paid for this room! She never sent it. I was in the neighborhood, and thought I'd pop by and see if it was ready. Really? Oh, hi, Ronnie. Hi, Zaara. How's it going? Andy Goldfarb? That's who you pick? Great! Nice to see you. You girls got so big. How's high school? You'll be the reason I start doing drugs! Same here! Hard. Very, very stressful. Good God! Um, I think that Stacy said she finished the video this weekend, so I can just email it to you ASAP. Thanks. Lydia keeps talking about how she doesn't wanna have a video anymore. - I know she'd regret it. - You're on your own! Good luck! I hope you die before Mom! - I'm taking you with me! - We'll see you. Mazel tov! Bye! Andy Goldfarb is going in the goddamn wood chipper! Okay. Dear God, Stacy here. So, as you probably already know, Lydia's Bat Mitzvah is coming up, and I really don't know what to do. I'm not even sure if she wants me there. If I was in this situation a month ago, I would've asked my friends what to do. Hey, look, we're twinning. Twinning? What are we in fourth grade?

Pull it together! - Calm down. - I don't want to go. Can you stop? H-hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Shabbat shalom. Shabbat shalom. Today is a very special day. Our brilliant, young Stacy Friedman is called to the bimah for her Bat Mitzvah. Oh, God. Do you hear her calling me up to receive an honor I do not deserve? I've been dreaming about this day my whole life, and now it's here. And I wish I could go back in bed, or under my bed, or literally anywhere... Seema? Barechu et Adonai hamevorach. Baruch Adonai hamevorach leolam vaed. Baruch Adonai hamevorach leolam vaed. Baruch Atah Adonai Eloheinu melech haolam, asher bachar banu mikol... ha-amim... I made a huge mistake. I'm sorry. I don't even know what I'm doing up here. Uh... In the Jewish religion, I am supposed to be a grown-up today. But I have been so selfish and bratty and annoying to my parents who just want... And then, it happened. The very day I was supposed to become a woman is the day that everything started to make sense. ...Nikki, Tara... When you're a kid, you think it's okay to put yourself in front of your friends in pursuit of something better. A woman knows there is nothing better than your friends. ...Kym, Megan, Anya... When you're a kid, sometimes you think you have to be someone you're not in order to fit in. ...if I'm being honest, it's probably 'cause we were, like, jealous or something... But a woman knows it's not about hiding who you are. It's about being yourself and speaking your truth. ...but also, you guys can be, like, such a-holes sometimes. Keep it PG in the temple. Sorry. Where'd she learn to curse like that? No idea. And the biggest difference between being a kid and an adult... Andy... ...is knowing what really matters. I'm gonna keep it brief 'cause I know you can't focus on one thing for that long, but you're basic and not nice to people, and if I'm being honest, not that good at soccer. You suck! And worst of all, because of you, I ruined my friendship with the one person that matters the most. I need to tell her how bad I messed up. Hey, hey, hey... You gotta go up there and finish your Torah portion before you go. Come here. Give it your best shot, and then we'll all fix this together. Hopefully, after I take off this itchy suit. You have coffee breath. Okay. All right. Use that up there. Go. Quickly, so quickly, so quickly. So quickly. Va-y'chal Moshe mi-dabeyr itam Va-yiteyn al panav masveh. Uv'vo Moshe lifney Adonai l'dabeyr ito Ya-sir et ha-masveh ad tzeyto V'yatza v'di-ber el b'ney Yisrael et asher y'tzuveh. V'ra-u v'ney Yisrael et p'ney Moshe Ki karan or p'ney Moshe v'heysheev Moshe Et ha-masveh al panav ad bo-oh l'dabeyr ito. I did it. Ya'sher koach! Now go! Lydia! Lydia. Lydia. Lydia, please open... The Andy stuff. I know you never hurt me on purpose. I should have let you apologize. I miss you, and I love you, and I'm sorry. I've been a horrible, selfish friend. Please, please forgive me. Stacy, you ruined my Bat Mitzvah. What part of that do you not understand? I don't under... Like... - I know. - Let me finish. That day at the ledge, I told you not to go. I told you don't jump. You jumped. Then the whole thing ended up being my fault. - Then I was the shitty friend? - I'm sorry. And I've known you liked Andy for, like, a million years, but guess what, Stacy? So has every other girl at our school, including me, but I never told you anything because I knew it'd just make you upset. And then, when you uninvited me to the day I've been helping you plan forever, I dated him to make you mad. Until you ruined it. Then you ruined your best friend's most important day of her life. So, yeah, I'm... I'm done here, Stacy. Wait, you're right. Yeah, I know. Just come to my Bat Mitzvah party tonight. I promise it'll be worth it. Please. I'm gonna take that as a maybe. Hello, again. Honey? Hi, Mom. Your father called in a lot of favors. I think it's gonna work out if she shows up. Come on. Let me do it. I know tonight's not exactly what you dreamed it would be, but I'm really proud of you. Okay, go. There. - Hmm. - Gorgeous. Thanks, doll. - I have something for you. - Okay. Okay, now, I know you may not like this, but... Really? Thank you! I think I'm gonna wear sneakers. Oh my God, you're a woman. You're a smart woman Let's party! Is she here? I don't think she's coming. Honey, she's gonna come. May I have your attention? It's starting. What if she doesn't come? Then everything's pointless. It's not pointless. - I could've been working on my golf game! - Oh, you're fine. You made it. I made it. Perfect timing. Just in time for your grand entrance. Listen guys and girls, ladies and gentlemen... No, Lydia... Please give a very sweet welcome to your Bat Mitzvah Lydia Rodriguez Katz! It's time for yours. Stacy, what is this?
