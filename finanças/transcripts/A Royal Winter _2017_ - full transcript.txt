"As they spoke, a royal coach drove up "with eight beautiful horses "decked with plumes of feathers and a golden harness. "They then took leave of the king and got into the coach, "and all set out full of joy and merriment "for the prince'’s kingdom, which they reached safely. "And there they lived a happily great many years." And there you have it, The Frog Prince. Still one of my favorites. I hope you all enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed sharing it with you. And let'’s all show Miss Marks how much we enjoyed having her read to us this semester. Thank you so much for your help. Good luck on your interview. Thank you. Finished top of your class. Good. The City Literacy Program, what'’s that? They send volunteers to read with kids in inner-city schools. All through law school? Yes. You had time? Uh, well, yeah, I made the time. I love working with children. Maggie, let me be really clear. We need somebody razor sharp, focused, committed 200% rain or shine. Absolutely. Once you'’re on the team, there isn'’t time for much else. Are we clear on that? Clear as rain. I mean glass. I mean... Very, very clear. That was tough. A lot tougher than I expected. She was just testing you. They'’re a top firm. They'’re weeding out the weak. That'’s me, the weak. No, you are not. They want commitment, you can commit. Honestly, I don'’t know if I'’m cut out for this. So you try a smaller outfit, something more boutique. Yeah, that'’ll go over really well with my dad. "Boutique is for shoes. You need a top firm." Okay, I'’m no lawyer, but there are... It'’s not just that. The bigger question is, do I really wanna be cooped up in an office 24/7, surrounded by guys, yes, mostly guys, clawing their way up to partner while doing meaningless work that helps no one but some corporation'’s bottom line for years? You know what? You are stressed out. You'’re exhausted. It'’s not the best time to be making life decisions. Which is what I wanted to talk to you about. Come to Europe with me. What? No. Why not? Even if I could, I cannot handle your friend Jenny for two weeks. And that'’s just it. Jenny canceled. She got a job. [SIGHS] That'’s what I need, a job. Look, they said they'’d get back to you in two weeks. It'’s the perfect time for a getaway. I got it all set. All you need to do is show up. Trust me, you'’ll have way more fun without me. Maggie Marks, when'’s the last time you had fun? From LSATs through law school, the bar exam, you'’ve had your head in the books for how many years now? You'’re the spontaneous one, not me. It'’s not you, which is exactly why you should do it. You said so yourself. Don'’t you wanna live a little before it'’s all billable hours, cooped up in an office 24/7? Where are you going again? MAN: Calpurnia? Where'’s that? Europe. It'’s southwest of the French Alps. Here we go. Big enough? Yeah, that'’s perfect. Thanks, Mom. And you'’d be gone two whole weeks? What if they want you back for a follow-up interview while you'’re away? [SCOFFS] Then you'’ll buy her a new return ticket. You can afford it. Here. Uh... "Calpurnia, a virtual winter wonderland." Oh and it really is a proper kingdom with its own royal family. "The perfect mixture of quaint and romantic." [GASPS] Who knows? You might even meet a nice European gentleman. Mom, please. That is the last thing I need right now. She needs to focus on work.She needs a break. Oh, hang on. I have something else for you. [SIGHS] I did try my best. You had one tough interview. I'’ll call. Please don'’t, Dad. Look, I know you wanna help but you gotta let me do this. [SIGHS] Or maybe I just can'’t. I don'’t know. Of course you'’re anxious. It'’s natural. But you'’re the toughest and smartest gal I know. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] Thanks, Dad. Here we go! Winter wonderland looks cold. [LAUGHING] I love you, Mom. I love you, too, honey. FELIX: Let'’s see then. Today you'’ve got a luncheon at noon, followed by a meeting with the chief of staff at 12:55. He requested the full hour to review your coronation speech. Then a 2:00 p.m. fitting with the tailor and his team for your coronation uniform. Whoa, no, hold on, hold on.Highness? Mother just left a five-minute gap between 1:55 and 2:00 p.m. I'’m not sure I'll know what to do with myself for those 300 seconds. [LAUGHING] [CELL PHONE VIBRATING] Ah, speak of the... ...queen bee. Her Majesty requests your presence immediately. It'’s in all caps. That'’s me done for. I blame you. You'’re the one who showed her how to text. It'’s fine. Just tell her I'’ll be down in a minute. Thank you. Good morning, Mother. Good morning, Dory, gentlemen. You made the papers again. Must be a slow news day again. This is ridiculous. She was a tourist. I was giving her directions. Well, you certainly seem very happy doing it. Mother, seriously... Adrian, you have to be careful, especially with your coronation coming up. More so than ever, you represent not only our family, but the entire country. So we want to present Calpurnians as what, exactly? A surly, unsmiling lot who are rude to tourists? Don'’t dare be daft. You know exactly what I mean. I want you to limit your gallivanting about town in this last stretch before the coronation. I'’m not staying cooped up in here for a week because some trashy tabloid prints lies. Your father, may he rest in peace, had a wonderful saying, "Sacrifice in..." "Sacrifice in service of your country is not sacrifice." Yes. I don'’t think he meant it to include house arrest for his son. Very well. In that case, I must insist that Felix go with you on your little outings at all times. Mother! Fine. Fine. I will consent to be chaperoned if you consider my previous request. Absolutely not. I'’m not turning a centuries-old tradition into a public free-for-all. Why shouldn'’t the coronation be open to the public? They'’re our citizens. If not for them, we wouldn'’t have a country. Adrian, the coronation is one of the few traditions the noble families have left. I will not take it away from them, from us. Yes, but... I won'’t discuss it any further. Fine. Well, then I guess I'’m free to roam, sans chaperone. I'’ll try not to disrupt the almighty schedule too much. [SIGHS] SARAH: Yes, yes, yes, you need a new hat. MAGGIE: I'’m okay, really. SARAH: These are classy. MAGGIE: Okay, let'’s see. Oh, how about this one? Mmm, I don'’t know. I look silly. You look adorable. She'’ll take it. Thank you. Thanks. And thank you. You'’re welcome. It'’s definitely you. And if we'’re lucky, the new you. [CHUCKLES] What are you doing? Nothing. Stop checking your emails! We'’re on vacation. We'’re supposed to be having an adventure, not... Here, give me that. This is all you need. And you can have your phone back when you start having fun. [SIGHS] SARAH: Let'’s see, the Forever Fountain. Legend has it that if you throw in a coin and make a wish, it'’ll come true. Okay, let me give this a try. What'’d you wish for? For you to lighten up. I will, I promise. Good, '’cause what happens in Calpurnia, stays in Calpurnia. I think we need to go on a tour with that tour guide. No, thanks. The last thing I need is guy trouble. It'’s not guy trouble if it'’s the right guy. You go. Honestly, I wouldn'’t mind wandering around for a bit. I'’ll be fine. Let'’s meet at the hotel at 4:00, and we'’ll figure out dinner, okay? Okay, thanks. [GIGGLING] Hey, my phone. [SIGHS] Okay, I'’ll give it back to you on one condition. You have to do something adventurous today. Something not you. Deal. Ciao. Ciao. [GASPS] [HORN HONKS] ADRIAN: Watch out! [GASPS] Hey! Watch where you'’re going! Hey! Hey! Come back! I guess that qualifies as an adventure. Looking for this? You! '’Tis indeed I. And this, I believe, is yours, with my apologies. Sorry. How did you clean it up so fast? Magic. Did the store have the same one? I will tell you on one condition. It'’s an ancient Calpurnian custom that a knight on horseback who rudely tramples a lady'’s hat buys her a latte. That'’s cute, but I gotta run. Run if you must, but aren'’t you forgetting something? If you'’re looking for another thank you... Oh, no, I meant this. How did you... Give me that back. How did you do that? A magician never reveals his secrets, unless he'’s plied with very strong coffee. No, honestly, I can'’t. The whole spontaneous thing, it'’s not really me. Well, how about tonight? Tonight is definitely less spontaneous than right now. Uh... You know what? Don'’t answer. Let'’s just leave it to mystery. If you decide to come, meet me at the fountain at 8:30. If you decide otherwise, well, then I hope you enjoy our little kingdom. I'’m enjoying it already. I'’m enjoying it already? I'’m enjoying it already. What is wrong with you? Good day, Your Highness. Mr. Wickford! How fares the hardest working chief of staff in the land? Well, sir, I can'’t complain. It'’s very kind of Her Majesty to lend us her office. My mother is nothing if not generous. Um, sorry I'’m late. No apologies necessary. To save us a little time, I'’ve drafted something we could use as a template for your coronation speech. Great, thank you. [CLEARS THROAT] "Citizens of Calpurnia, assembled members of..." Assembled members. Sounds like something out of Frankenstein. [CHUCKLES] Of course. Well, we can can always adjust later. "As your future monarch, I solemnly pledge..." Nope, not "solemn." It'’s not a funeral. Wickford, can I ask you something a bit off-topic? Of course. What are your thoughts on opening the coronation up to the public? You know, 21st century, bring the people in on the process. Well, it'’s not really my...Come on, come on. I'’m not looking for an official position. Just, you know, your personal opinion. [CLEARS THROAT] Whilst I admire your intentions, I feel that the coronation is a special tradition set aside for the noble families. My mother already spoke to you, didn'’t she? Yeah. Never mind. "The law of succession is an immutable..." I'’m sorry. This sounds nothing like me. Well, to be honest, Your Highness, I used your late father'’s coronation speech as a framework for this draft. Oh, well, that explains a lot. Um... All right, once again, in case no one'’s noticed, I'’m not my father. Of course, Your Highness. And we will adjust as necessary. MAGGIE: And then he asked me out. [CHUCKLES] A near-miss with a motorbike? Yeah, that definitely counts as an adventure. I keep my promises. So, you gonna meet him tonight? No. I don'’t know, should I? Why not? We'’re an ocean away from home. If you don'’t like him, you don'’t ever have to see him again. I guess. Thank you. Thank you. SARAH: Oh, I could shadow you if you'’re worried. You can what? You know, like, go with you, hang in the background, make sure he'’s safe. What are friends for? Hello, ladies. Might I interest you in a souvenir? I made them myself. We'’re raising money for our school trip to Rome. What did I tell you? You may do your fundraising outside. You may not disturb the guests in here. Excuse me, she wasn'’t disturbing us. I was actually just looking for a souvenir for our trip. My apologies, mademoiselle. You must understand that management tends to frown upon... Students showing leadership and creativity? Exactly! I'’m a leader, not to mention creative. Let'’s see. That one looks really beautiful. Oh, let me see. So lovely. Oh, you can quote statistics all night long, but the fact is the Arabian is the only purebred racehorse left in the world today. Not quite. Your Arabian is the oldest, but still a human-developed breed, so not technically pure. What do you think, Your Highness? Oh, I think they should ask the horses whether they enjoy racing in the first place. The Royal Equestrian Rally is one of your late father'’s favorite traditions. Not all traditions deserve to be continued. My Lords, if you'’ll excuse me. Your Highness. Your Highness. Ah, there you are. I want to introduce you to Lady Camelia. She'’s dying to meet you. Oh, I... We need her father'’s vote in Parliament on a trade agreement, unless you have a more pressing engagement. No. Then come. Lady Camelia, may I present my son Prince Adrian. Your Highness, I am so delighted to meet you. Pleasure is all mine. I'’m so sorry, honey. I guess he'’s not coming. That'’s all right. Let'’s just... There you are! Sorry I'’m late. Family thing ran over way past its time. Hi. Hi. I'’m glad you came. Hello, I'’m Adrian. Hi, I'’m Sarah Payne. I'’m just here to... Make sure I'’m safe? Perfectly understandable. Did I really make that bad a first impression?[CHUCKLES] You'’re right, he is funny. And definitely easy on the eyes. Sarah. Sorry. I forgot that was my outside voice. [CHUCKLING] So do you want to get that coffee now? And would you like to join us?Yeah, you should come. Oh, no, no, I'’m... [YAWNS] I'’m really tired. The jet lag is catching up with me, so you guys go. Okay, okay. Go have fun! Bye. Come on. I know the perfect spot. By the way, I'’m Adrian. Yeah, you already... Oh, I'’m sorry. I'’m Maggie. Just one cup, okay? Otherwise, I'’ll be up all night, and the jet lag. You have my word. One cup only. If they offer us refills, we'’ll have them executed. Hello. Oh. Oh, Y... Your... Your... You'’re more than welcome to sit anywhere you like. [PIANO PLAYING] MAGGIE: I'’m good at it, but lately I feel a little trapped, like I'’m... Following someone else'’s plans. Yes! Like it was expected of me to be a lawyer, so I never really gave anything else a try. And then it dawned on me at this interview that here I am desperate for a job where I'’ll be spending millions of hours, just a cog in a machine. Maybe you should trust your instincts. Don'’t do it. Um... Not that simple. I mean, it'’s a good career move, I want the security, I need the salary, and to be fair, my parents did give up a lot for me to get to this point. Ah, yes, never underestimate the power of parental guilt. Yeah, but it is also me. I'’ve been on this path too long. I'’m too scared to get off. I know the feeling. I'’ve had my life pretty much dictated for me since before I was born. Hmm, let me guess. They always wanted you to be a doctor. Uh, no. We have a family business. A very old family business. Lots of rules and regulations. Banking? No, mostly real estate, a bit of politics, boring stuff. My late father was really good at running it. Now my mother and everyone else expects me to take over, but sometimes it'’s the last thing that I want to do. No siblings? You don'’t have a younger sister you could pass the torch to? Sadly, no. When I was younger, I loved being the only child. Now... Now you'’re like, "Please! I wish there was someone else "they could obsess over for a while." Yes! [BOTH CHUCKLE] So come on, out with it. Tell me your secret. Excuse me? I went for coffee with you. The trick with the watch. Oh! [LAUGHS] Well, you want to know the real secret? Yes. The secret is that you don'’t really want to know. [CHUCKLES] Well, sir, that'’s very presumptuous of you. You don'’t want to know '’cause it would ruin the mystery. You enjoy the mystery too much to ruin it. I can see it in your eyes. Can you? Yes. Uh, well, it'’s late. Thank you for the coffee and the mystery. You'’re very welcome. You free any other days while you'’re here? Uh, well, my friend Sarah planned the trip. I'’m kind of just along for the ride. So, I'’m not sure what the schedule'’s like. Why don'’t I just check in with you tomorrow? We can leave it to mystery. Okay. I'’d like that. Good night. I had a great time. Me too. [BOTH LAUGH] I worry about you, riding that machine at night. Thank you, Mother, but I'’m fine. And a bit old for a curfew. When we were young, your father loved to go dancing on Friday nights. Did he? Yes. But after his coronation, he stopped. Why? Because he realized it was unseemly for a king to just be one of the guys. The people expect us to be different, separate. We'’re not just citizens. We'’re symbols of state. That is just sad. Profoundly sad. Good night, Mother. [KNOCKING AT DOOR] Coming. Room service. I didn'’t order this. You did not, and yet here it is. Oh, come in, please. What'’s going on? "If you'’re into more mystery, eat a good breakfast "and let Henrik, your concierge, know if you'’re available "for an outing at 10:00 this morning or any time thereabouts. "He will get the message to me. "Adrian. "P.S. Dress warmly "and tell your friend Sarah she'’s welcome to come along." Do you know Adrian? Since he was a boy. And his family. Wonderful people. He said they were in business. What do they do? I am sorry, mademoiselle. I have been sworn to secrecy. Come on, out with it. I have also been threatened with unemployment. Do they own the hotel? No. I'’ll be back with tea. Should we go? You should go. You'’re not coming? Maggie, this is breakfast for two, but it'’s an invitation for one. Yeah, but he wrote... Uh-uh! Just the facts, please, Counselor. One, and I quote, you guys talked for hours. Two, you said you felt like you'’ve know each other your whole lives. Okay, okay, I get it. You don'’t want me along, trust me. Besides, I still owe you a birthday gift from last year. So, I'’m gonna pick that out this morning. I'’ll meet you at the art museum after lunch, and you can act surprised. I don'’t know. I gotta think about it. What is there to think about? He sent bacon. True. MAGGIE: It'’s not that I don't wanna practice law any more. It'’s just that I want my work to mean something. Wow. It'’s beautiful out here. Really beautiful. So if you weren'’t a lawyer, what would you do? I don'’t know. Probably teach. I love working with kids. Right, yes, the tutoring. Hey, you know, I work with kids, too. Oh, yeah? Yeah, I coach volleyball. And the kids, they'’re amazing. You show them something new, and their faces light up. They realize they can finally do something they never thought possible. Opening up the world for someone, it'’s like... Magic. Yeah. [CELL PHONE RINGING] Sorry. Uh, it'’s work, um... Of course. What is it? FELIX: [OVER PHONE] Apologies, Your Highness. The Royal Trust Judiciary meeting? No, isn'’t that in... Uh, no, I lost track of time. The Judicial Secretary'’s here. Your mother'’s insisting you sign the transfer documents, as we'’re so close to the coronation. And she'’s ready to tear the kingdom apart looking for you and blaming me. ADRIAN: [OVER PHONE] Okay. Tell them I'’m on my way and I'’ll be there as soon as I can. Is everything all right? Yeah, I forgot about a meeting. Lost track of time. Easy to do out here. Yes, it is. Well, we should get you to your meeting then. I mean, I'’d much rather not, but... I get it. The real world calls. SARAH: Lost track of time is good. And he'’s taking me on a ride around the countryside tomorrow. Nice! Wow. Excuse me? ATTENDANT: Yes, please. Who are these people? Well, like the plaque says, that is the royal family of Calpurnia. That is our late King Albert, may he rest in peace, and that is his wife Queen Beatrice. She is our current monarch. And that one? That one is their son Prince Adrian. In just a few days, he will be crowned as our next king. Uh, Maggie? Yeah. You may wanna get over here. That is the Prince of Calpurnia. Yeah, so? Wait, that... That'’s Adrian. There he is, Prince Adrian of Calpurnia. That'’s crazy. Uh-oh. What? "Europe'’s most eligible bachelor, "the Playboy Prince." Oh, no. [MOTOR IDLING] [MOTOR TURNS OFF] Hey, ready to go? As you wish, Your Highness. Cool, let'’s... Your Highness? You know? Sarah and I went to the museum. Portrait gallery. Yeah. Right. Uh... Hey, it'’s the prince! WOMAN: Oh, my God! [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Your Royal Highness, a pleasure as always. The pleasure is all mine. I was wondering, is the atrium closed for the winter season? Yes, sir. Please follow me around back. [SQUEALS] [LAUGHS] ADRIAN: I'’m really sorry. I should have told you. MAGGIE: Yes, you should have, Your Worshipfulness. Forms of royal address obviously not covered in American law schools. I gotta say, I feel a little foolish. Maggie, we were getting along so well. I didn'’t want to ruin anything with... With the truth. No, no, just... You seemed to enjoy my company for who I am, not because of my title or the money or what they write about me. Wait, some girls wanna go out with you because of what they write? You'’d be amazed what attracts some people to celebrity. I come from a completely different world. Yes, yes, exactly. And that is what is so great about you. One of the many things, I might add. Do you say that to all the other girls? Come on. The tabloid stuff, it isn'’t true. No, I'’m just sorry that... That you got caught. No, no, just that we were getting to know each other as real people. The real me and the real you. That'’s the thing, Adrian. For me to get to know the real you, that means all of you, not just the part of you that you want me to see. Okay, fair enough. I'’d like to show you the real me, but in a different way. What do you mean? But not here. Okay, the thing is, I'’m actually really terrified of motorcycles. Oh, no, no, it'’s fine. We can walk there. It'’s only a couple of blocks away. And you can escape back to your hotel anytime you want. Please. Okay. Okay. Uh, okay, come on. There'’s another way in. You see, avoiding paparazzi is like the royal sport of the Calpurnian crown. Let me guess. You'’re the reigning champion. Smart and beautiful. I like that. [BELL DINGING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Okay, now this, this is what I wanted to show you. This is the real me. This is where I feel most at home. Ooh! How lucky. [BLOWS WHISTLE] Okay, just carry on. Felix, this is my friend Maggie. Maggie, this is Felix, my valet. He also helps out here, out of the goodness of his true Calpurnian heart. A pleasure. The pleasure'’s all mine. Felix, do you mind telling Maggie a little bit about what we do here? Uh, sure, what exactly should I... Tell her the whole truth and nothing but. BOY: Come on, Adrian, we need you! Right, okay, my lady, you'’ll have to excuse me. My presence is requested. [BLOWS WHISTLE] Okay, guys, let'’s practice serves. Everyone line up on the other side. You must be a really good friend for him to bring you here. Does he bring other friends here? He'’s never brought anyone here. You are the first. His own mother doesn'’t know anything about this. You'’re kidding. Nope. The work we do here is his true passion, and he is very protective of it. See, when he was a boy, Adrian was shocked to learn that there are people in Calpurnia less fortunate than he, so when he turned 18, he received a large sum of money from the royal trust, and he spent most of it setting up his foundation for children from low-income families. Wow. FELIX: It'’s funny. The tabloids call him the "Playboy Prince." What kind of playboy spends most of his money on this? [BLOWS WHISTLE] All right, guys, good stuff. Right, let'’s run some drills. Uh, Felix. Excuse me. Duty calls. Thank you. So what kind of lies did Felix tell you about me? Only the truth and nothing but. So this is the real you, huh? Well, it'’s the part of me I like best. I like it, too. Can I ask you a question? Of course. Why keep this a secret? The press gets one whiff of this and your whole public image changes. I don'’t trust them. "Playboy Prince" sells papers. "Good-Boy Prince" doesn'’t. WOMAN: All right, children, everyone up on the stage. What'’s going on over there? Oh, choir practice. Yeah, some of the kids aren'’t as into sports, so we... BOY: Adrian! Uh, I'’ll tell you what. Can you just give me two seconds? I just... Yeah. [PIANO PLAYING] ♪ Frere Jacques Frere Jacques ♪ Dormez-vous Dormez-vous ♪ Sonnez les matines Sonnez les matines ♪ Hi.

Your life'’s mission, huh? Mmm-hmm. I guess that means we'’ll be seeing each other again. Only if you want to. I guess I do. It'’s just... I'’m only here for a short while, and you seem pretty busy. I'’ll make time for you. That'’s sweet, but don'’t you have a coronation to get ready for? Yes, my lady, but we have people for that sort of thing. I'’ll tell you what. Why don'’t you drop by the palace for dinner tonight? You said you wanted to meet all of me. This would be your chance to see the other side. Wow. I... I mean thank you. But is the palace someplace you just drop by? It is if you'’re with the prince. [CHUCKLES] All right. How about I send a car to pick you up at your hotel, and we get you on the guest list? All proper like. Maggie, trust me, it'’ll be fun. Okay. Great. SARAH: I can'’t believe that you'’re dating a king. He'’s not king yet, and we'’re not dating. We'’re just enjoying each other'’s company. Uh, I think that'’s the actual definition of dating. I don'’t know. This one? Is this fancy enough? I guess. Maybe next time you should consider your wardrobe before accepting a palatial invitation. [KNOCKING AT DOOR] Hello. The Prince realized you might need some assistance for this evening. Oh, my... Wow! Dating a prince definitely has its perks. Ah! Adrian'’s bringing a guest? Why wasn'’t I informed of this before? I am sorry, Your Majesty. It'’s a last-minute addition. I'’ve only just found out myself. Would you like me to talk to the prince? No. Let'’s meet this person. But as with any palace visitor, I assume you'’ll run a full background check. Absolutely. Right away. Wow. Miss. Thank you. Miss. Thank you. I knew you'’d pick that dress. You did? I wish you would have told me. It took me an hour to make up my mind. [CHUCKLES] You look beautiful. I'’m really glad you came. You dress up pretty nice yourself, Your Highness. I guess that'’s not a joke. That'’s your real title. I'’m chattering on. I'’m sorry. The only other time I'’ve been to a castle was at Disneyland. Well, we'’re not much for amusement rides here, although dinner with my mother can be a roller coaster. Good evening. Mother! May I introduce Maggie Marks, an American visiting our fair land from New York. Maggie, this is my mother Queen Beatrice of Calpurnia. Uh... How do you do? Fine, thank you. Welcome to our home, Miss Marks. I'’m delighted that you could join us. Since my forgetful son has kept everything about you a mystery up till now, I'’m eager to make your acquaintance. He does love his mystery, doesn'’t he? Indeed. Well, I'’m famished. Shall we? New York'’s lovely at this time, but not like here. To us tourists, you live in a fairy tale. LADY CAMELIA: So how exactly do you know the prince? The street. I mean, we met on the street. I ran over her hat. Oh, how adorably uncivilized of you. Perhaps it'’s time to give our American guest a chance to eat. Your Highness, I hear the final arrangements for the coronation are moving along smoothly. Yes, my mother and staff have me on quite a tight leash. Speaking of which, I'’d love your opinion. As an expert in government affairs... Adrian. ...do you see any reason why we shouldn'’t open the coronation to the public? Ah, the age-old question of modern populism versus aristocratic tradition. I believe your father, may he rest in peace, said that there is an inverse correlation between how long a monarch has ruled and their desire to be seen as one with the people. It takes awhile for young rulers to realize that their job is not to be popular, but to govern. It'’s not about being popular. It'’s about allowing our citizens to be part of a ceremony that will very much affect their lives. Well, personally, I appreciate that the coronation is one of the few traditions we have kept according to its original centuries-old design. People love the aristocracy because our traditions give everyone a window into a more civilized past, as far back as the Renaissance, even the Middle Ages. I hardly think the Middle Ages were civilized. MAGGIE: And the Renaissance wasn'’t great either. I mean, didn'’t the Inquisition happen during the Renaissance? Well, certainly not here. No, I wasn'’t implying that. And what would be the American perspective on the issue? Oh, I wouldn'’t want to meddle, I mean intrude. QUEEN BEATRICE: No, no, not at all. We'’d be very grateful for your opinions as an outsider. Well, of course, I don'’t know as much as all of you about the issue, but I agree with Adrian. I don'’t see anything wrong in inviting the people to the coronation. Wouldn'’t it give the press something positive to write about? That'’s exactly what I was saying. I read a survey recently that said the whole idea of royalty is becoming quite obsolete and not just in third-world countries. So maybe connecting with the everyday people would make the monarchy more relevant? Well, I for one, do not feel obsolete. No, I didn'’t mean that. And Calpurnia is far from a third-world country. Dory, I think time for more wine. Yes, please. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] I'’m so sorry. Oh, no, if anyone should apologize, it'’s me. I just threw you into the lion'’s den. I had no idea it would get that tense. Adrian. I need to speak to you. Felix will see Miss Marks back to her hotel. I'’d rather take her. No, no. No problem at all. Felix can drive me. Please. And again, thank you so much for your wonderful hospitality. Dinner was delicious, and you have a beautiful home. I'’ll give your compliments to the chef. Good night. Good night. I'’ll call you in a bit, okay? Sure. Adrian, you hardly know that girl. Why did you bring her here? Because I really like her, and I'’m getting to know her. You are the future king. Do you not understand the implications? You can'’t just date anyone you wish. No. That'’s the thing, you see. I can. And I will. The rest of you just have to deal with it. [SPLAT] [SPLAT] [SPLAT] Want to go for a walk? Are you sure? Of course I'’m sure. I'’m sort of a lot of trouble for you. Maybe I like trouble. Give me a minute. [DISTANT CHATTER] Sorry for all the sneaking around on the back streets. It'’s just... I get it. You'’re not just some guy. As much as I want to be. Maybe you shouldn'’t try so hard to be someone else. Find your own way of being king. Easier said than done. I don'’t know. Maybe I'’m just not ready. I wish you could see yourself the way I see you. The way you are with those kids at the church. You'’re kind, you're caring, you'’re funny. Funny looking. [CHUCKLES] You'’ll make a wonderful king. Well, you are very kind. But that'’s not what makes a good ruler. Who defines that, your mother? My dad was so good at it. Like at dinner. He would have run circles around those nobles and their pretentious nonsense. He would have had them and my mother agreeing to whatever he wanted before the second course and then thinking it was their idea in the first place. So he'’s a master manipulator. Pretty much. I don'’t know how to do that. Who says you have to? You'’re more of a doer than a talker anyway. Oh, well, don'’t sell my dad short. He was a great guy. No, I didn'’t mean that. You miss him. When I was little, he used to make up stories for me with whatever was around. Like if he was here, he'’d say these lights are mystical flowers that bloom only at night, and they grant wishes to whoever knows how to unlock their secrets. Who says they aren'’t? See, the lights are magic. They turn your hair to gold. You'’ve a beautiful way of seeing things. And you'’re just beautiful. Thank you, Your Highness. I'’ve never kissed a prince before. How was it? Awesome. [CAMERA CLICKS] [CLICK] [CLICK] Thank you. Oh, I slept in and I still can'’t believe how tired I am. That'’s what happens when you stay out most of the night. You'’re just jealous. PHOTOGRAPHER: Hey, there she is! [ALL CLAMORING] What'’s happening? Out, out! Please go back to your room. Quickly! You must leave immediately! Out! This is private property! Have you seen the papers? Do you ever think about the consequences of your actions? I messed up again, and I apologize. Where are you going? To see if Maggie'’s okay. To see if Maggie'’s okay? What about us? It'’s your coronation in a few days. We have to mitigate the damage. You have an entire staff to mitigate the damage. You don'’t need me here. Don'’t you realize it's not me you'’re avoiding? It'’s yourself. Your responsibility. Honestly, sometimes I'’m glad your father'’s not here to see this. Do you know what, Mother? The truth is you don'’t want me to take the crown. You want Dad back, and that'’s not happening. How dare you! No, I'’m not a puppet, and I never will be. And I don'’t think my father would want me to be one either. SARAH: "Although there has been no official statement "from the crown, "the young lady in question appears to be "Maggie Marks of Manhattan." Nice alliteration. Not funny. It just goes on to say that you are a recent law school graduate on vacation, blah blah blah. Uh, there is no mention of me anywhere. This is bad. Right before the coronation, too. They must be going crazy at the palace. Did you talk to him yet? It keeps going to voicemail. [CELL PHONE RINGING] Adrian? No, it'’s Dad. Oh, hi. How are things at home? For what I can see, not as hopping as things are in Europe. That made the U.S. papers? No. You didn'’t call last night, and so your father Googled "Calpurnia" to see if anything bad was happening. Maggie, what exactly is going on there between you and this prince? Nothing. They'’re making a big deal of nothing. Well, that'’s good because from here, it looks rather embarrassing. Dad, it was just a kiss. Brockton & Pierce take appearances very seriously. So what do you want me to do? That'’s not for me to decide. You'’ve got a good head on your shoulders. I'’m sure you'll do the right thing. Love you. Love you, too. SARAH: What did he say? I think he'’s expecting me to go home. Did he even ask you if you like the guy? No. Out! Out, out! You got my text? Are they still out there? Yeah, just some of our more die-hard journalists. Vultures, really. I'’m so sorry. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] Thank you. It'’s not your fault. I'’m happy you're here. Let'’s go to Paris. What? Yeah. Just for a couple of days. It'’ll be a lot more fun than sneaking around here, avoiding the vultures. I'’m not sure that'’s such a good idea. Well, your friend Sarah can come, too, of course. I'’ll get you guys your own hotel suite, everything. That'’s very generous of you. but aren'’t you being crowned in a few days? That'’s all set in motion. I'’d rather spend the time with you. And I with you. but right now the whole country is watching, waiting to see what kind of king you'’ll be. And running off to Paris with some American girl may not be the best idea. You'’re not just some... Do you know what? It doesn'’t actually matter what I do. The tabloids will print what they want. Surprise them. Tell them about the children'’s foundation. No. I wouldn'’t let them use the kids as pawns, even if it helps me. You are so wonderful. I want everyone to see that. I'’m just glad you see it. [CELL PHONE RINGS] Sorry. The palace? No, volleyball. I have practice in half an hour. Do you wanna come? I would love to, but I promised Sarah I'’d finally go shopping. Ah, of course. Well, try to stay clear of the vultures, and if you get into trouble, this is Felix'’s number. He'’ll extricate you anytime, anywhere, and bring you straight to me. Thank you. Any other expert advice on avoiding the press? I have two words for you. Yes? Winter wardrobe. Who knew your mom'’s clothes would work well as a disguise? Why don'’t you say it louder so that everyone can hear you? Sorry. I can'’t believe you turned down Paris. I just met him this week. Okay, so maybe he jumped the gun a little bit. You think? But he'’s not just a guy. He'’s a prince. Like, you remember Lenny Schwartzman with the crazy beard, who lived upstairs from me on 23rd Street? Yeah. So we go out on a few dates, couple of good night kisses, next thing you know, he wants me to drive to the Poconos to meet his mom. So? So? Prince Adrian of Calpurnia taking you to Paris is Lenny Schwartzman taking me to the Poconos. They'’re royals. They fly everywhere. Who wouldn'’t wanna live like that? [CELL PHONE RINGING] Oh, no. They must have seen the tabloids. What? I should take this. Hello? JANICE: [OVER PHONE] Maggie. It'’s Janice Brockton here. MAGGIE: [OVER PHONE] Janice! It'’s so nice to hear from you. Likewise. Listen, we have some news for you. Look before you say anything, the article, it wasn'’t... What article? Oh, uh... MAN: Maggie, it'’s not an article we need to talk to you about. It'’s a job. Really? JANICE: We'’d like to offer you a position here, an associate position in litigation. We'’re willing to make you a very reasonable offer, but there'’s a catch. We need you to start right away. How soon? We need an answer by tomorrow morning so we can get you started on Monday. We'’re emailing you the offer right now. You'’re gonna make your dad real proud, kid. Thank you. Thank you very much. What'’s wrong? WICKFORD: It'’s done. They'’ve offered her the job. Did she accept? They'’ll know for sure tomorrow. She'’s an ambitious girl, but she struck me as a little timid. She'’ll go for the safe choice. I'’m so glad our background checks proved useful, Your Majesty. There'’s really no choice. There'’s always a choice. Like what, give up the perfect job for some guy I just met? For a prince you just met. That'’s irrelevant. Let me rephrase that, Counselor. For a prince that you'’re quickly falling for. I'’m not. Oh, please! Tell it to the judge. How about this perfect job? Would this be the meaningless job that had you terrified you'’d reduce your life to billable hours, working in an office 24/7, a cog in the machine? [SIGHS] I came here for a vacation, not to have my life turned upside-down. Let me ask you a question. Rushing back home like this, does it make you happy? Yes. No. I... There are more important things in life than just being happy. Oh, of course! What was I thinking? ADRIAN: All right, good game! Well done! BOYS: Bye! Hey, stranger. Hey. Can we talk? Yeah. Oh, but before I forget, um... [CHUCKLES] What'’s this? It'’s from little Katya. She made it for you. She said it'’s a thank-you gift for helping her sing. What'’s wrong? They offered me the job in New York. That'’s great. They want me to start right away. Ah. Well, when would you leave? The day after tomorrow. The day of your coronation. I see. Uh... Well, of course you should go. I mean, it would be crazy for you not to, right? Exactly. This is the job you weren'’t thrilled about. It'’s a really good career move. The perfect one, really. No, yeah, of course. And I'’ve been thinking, I'’m a huge distraction for you. Like last night. No, no, that was just a hiccup. Stuff like that happens all the time. To you, not to me. See, we'’re from really different worlds. For me, being with someone is a personal decision. For you, it'’s an act of state. Yeah. Well, you'’ve certainly thought this through for both of us. I'’m sorry. I didn'’t mean to... All right. Last night, you told me not to try so hard to be someone else, to find my own way to be king. So I ask you, and of course, I'’ll respect your decision, just make sure you'’re not trying to live the life you think you should, instead of the life you want. What are you saying? Stay. Please. I don'’t want to lose you. I'’m sorry. I can't. I was thinking. After the coronation, I'’ll stop riding my bike. Not too seemly for a monarch. [SIGHS] [CELLPHONE VIBRATING] Hi. MAGGIE: [OVER PHONE] Hi. I wanted to see if you were okay. Are you still leaving? I'’m sorry. Well, then I'’m not so okay. But hey, at least my mother'’s happy. She'’s getting the coronation and the son that she always wanted. Will she at least let the public come, give you something to make it your own? You met my mother just once, so it'’s understandable that you don'’t know her at all. And she doesn'’t know you at all, not the real you. You need to show her who you are. Don'’t give up. Neither should you. I guess I should pack. And I have a speech to memorize. Has to be perfect on the big day and all that. Right, right, of course. I'’ll let you go. If you need anything... I'’ll call. You too. Bye. Felix? It'’s Maggie. Is Adrian coaching the kids today? What time? No, no, it'’s not for me, but I have a favor to ask. A big one. Begging your pardon, Your Majesty. Yes. You have a visitor. I do? There'’s nothing scheduled until... Ms. Marks. I'’m so sorry to intrude, Your Majesty. Did my son bring you? No, he has no idea I'’m here. I brought myself. Don'’t blame Felix. It'’s really important, or I never would'’ve barged in on you like this. I'’m leaving tomorrow. You'’ll never see me again and neither will Adrian, but there'’s something I must tell you. Then you better come in.

Really good work. I'’m very proud. Um... I'’m going to let you in on a secret. I asked Madame here to teach you that song because it'’s very special to me. You see, my dad used to sing it to me when I was a little boy, so... thank you for making an old man very happy. It was great. Weren'’t they good? What are you doing here? That was quite something. I remember your father singing it to you. So this is where you come on your outings to town. You... This was all your idea? Yes. Why did you bring her here? Oh, he didn'’t. I mean... He drove me here, but it wasn'’t his idea. It was your friend Maggie'’s. She arrived at the palace uninvited. She burst into my office and demanded to be seen. Then she told me I didn'’t know my own son. She was adamant that there was something I ought to see, something that might convince me he wasn'’t just a dilettante gallivanting about town, that he was a serious man, ready to be a leader. Maggie told you all this? Yes. She felt she owed it to you before she left for America. She'’s still leaving, then? Yes. [SIGHS] But... I'’ve had an idea. We should invite the children to sing at your coronation, that very song. It would be a beautiful tribute to your father'’s memory. You'’re serious? Invite the children? Yes. Oh, for heaven sake, let'’s just invite everybody. Everybody? Everybody. Yes, yes! [ADRIAN LAUGHING] [KNOCKING AT DOOR] HENRIK: Special delivery. From the palace. Invitations to the coronation. Thank you. For the first time in Calpurnia'’s history, the royal coronation has been opened to all our citizens. Good night, miss. [CHUCKLES] We'’re invited to the coronation? Wow. Maybe it worked. You should go. I can'’t. You go. Oh, I'’m definitely going. I'’m not cutting my vacation short. Wow. It'’s beautiful! Gold lettering? Oh, you should definitely go. It'’s the chance of a lifetime. When'’s the next time you'll be invited to a royal coronation? I mean can'’t you get your dad to pull some old-boy networking strings and have them wait an extra day? I can'’t. Oh, sweetie, I'’m so sorry. Of course I wanna go see him become king, but I'’m scared. Of what? That if I go, I'’ll want to stay. Would that be so bad? My real life isn'’t here. It'’s at home. This is a vacation, a fantasy. Your life is whatever you make it. [KNOCKING AT DOOR] No need to put that on yet. You'’ve still got hours before anyone shows up. Couldn'’t sleep. Neither could I. She was right, you know. You'’re going to make a wonderful king. I'’m so... Very, very proud of you. I'’m sorry it took a complete stranger to make me see. Not a stranger. Of course. Forgive a foolish mother her choice of words. It'’s all right. Oh, make sure to have breakfast. These things can go on forever. DESK CLERK: Here you go. You enjoyed your stay? MAGGIE: I did. Thank you. I'’m sorry to see you go, miss. I'’m sorry, too. Thank you for everything. Happy to be of service. Let'’s get you to your car then. Car! Oh, my goodness. I'’ve been so all over the place, I forgot to call a taxi. I wouldn'’t exactly call it a taxi, miss. What'’s going on? Someone wants a word. I don'’t think I can. Please. Adrian, I... Your Majesty. Good morning, Miss Marks. I know you'’re in a hurry. Well, um, just my plane... Oh, I'’ll have them hold the plane if necessary. Oh, thank you. First of all, I came to thank you for yesterday. The children, my son'’s work at his foundation, it really opened my eyes. I'’m glad, very glad. And Adrian misses you. He'’s really suffering without you. I miss him, too. I have a confession to make, a rather embarrassing one. Our family has sizable business dealings in America. A few days ago, I instructed my chief of staff to retain the firm Brockton & Pierce to represent us in three very lucrative negotiations. You... I convinced them to offer you the job you wanted. To get rid of me? Yes, as I am most ashamed to admit. Oh, you have to understand they were delighted to have you. You'’d greatly impressed them, so it wasn'’t a difficult push. But it was wrong. I thought I was protecting my son. But really I was protecting myself. So... I'’m going to make up for it. What did he say? It wasn'’t Adrian. It was the queen. She offered me a job. What? She wants to expand Adrian'’s children'’s foundation, not just here, but all over Europe, try to get other royal families to participate. And you'’d be... Its legal counsel. Use my negotiation skills to forge new partnerships. So you'’d get to work with kids, and you'’d actually be helping people? This is so awesome. That sure beats all-nighters at Brockton & Pierce. I gotta think about this. It'’s all happening too fast. My flight leaves in two hours. Shall I call for that taxi? Yes, please. [BELL TOLLING] And part of that pledge, perhaps its most important part, is to make your concerns my own and to listen to you, all of you, which is why it was so important for me to have you here because it is only through the support and goodwill of the people, each and every citizen, yes, even the members of our ubiquitous press... [ALL LAUGH] ...that monarchy has any place at all in a modern government. As someone very special to me recently told me... I'’m more of a doer than a talker. So it is with a humble heart and doors open to all that I ask you to let me show you what I can do for Calpurnia and for each and every one of you. Thank you. BISHOP: Your Highness? Your Highness? So much for listening. [ALL LAUGH] [DRUMBEATS CONTINUE] BISHOP: Ladies and gentlemen, citizens and loyal subjects all, may I present His Royal Majesty King Adrian of Calpurnia. Long may he reign. ALL: Long live the king! Long live King Adrian! [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Congratulations, Your Majesty. If you'’ll follow me this way, the press would like a few photographs. I'’m sorry, I just need a minute. But, sir, they'’ve been... Wickford, they can wait. Of course, Your Majesty, as you wish. You'’re here. You sent the invitation, gold lettering and all. What about your job? A mysterious stranger once told me, after destroying my hat, mind you, that I shouldn'’t follow someone else'’s plan. And I may have some new ones. Might they include you sticking around for a while? Well, that'’s the thing. I was thinking if I'’m gonna give up the job of a lifetime... Yes? I might need to be persuaded. How'’s that for a start?
