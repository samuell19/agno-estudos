What a huge black forest! Wang Zhong,where are we? lt's Mt. Blackwind ahead,full of monsters! No wonder it feels so weird here. Master, let's walk around it. There's a shortcut ahead leading to MtFingers l think that road would be safer. Okay, let's take the shortcut. Wang Zhong... Wang Zhong... Zhang He... Zhang He... King, we caught Monk Tang. Good, excellent. Bring him here Yes. Bring him here. Yes. Eating Tang's flesh can bring you long life. Monk Tang. l've waited for you for years. l've never imagined, you would be under my control today. Come, pour wine. Yes. Who are you? l'm Monk Tang. Bullshit, you're not Tang. Where is Tang, tell me. l don't know. Don't know. Tell me. l don't know. l don't know! l'll show you my powers. Third Prince. King of Black-wind, you're not my friend. You didn't tell me you're eating Tang's flesh. Forget it, that's not even Tang. The real Tang ran away. lmpossible, you're hiding him. Why did you say this? You knew it well. Release Tang immediately. Otherwise, l'll get my sword out. Prince Third, you're pushing the limit. You've no sense of appreciation. See my sword. Come. Hang on. l smell Tang's flesh. What? Tang's flesh? Tang must be somewhere around here. Guys, come and catch Tang. lf you can't find him, you'll all be dead. Yes. Wake up, Mentor. Wake up, Mentor, wake up, Mentor. Mentor. Who are you? I'm Monkey, I messed Sky Palace 500 years ago. Why are you here? It's because I made an offence in Heaven, Buddha Ru-lai suppressed me here. Guan-yin saved me from the swayed path, to protect you to the West for the Script I've long been waiting for you. Quickly get me out of here. Mentor, save me. Mentor, save me, please. lf you save me, l will accompany you to the West. How can l save you? There's the Buddha's gold book at the hill top All you need to do is remove it. Mentor, quickly save me. Mentor... Let me off, so I can go up and see. God, Follower Chen is told to get the script. Monkey and I are fellow apprentices. We can remove it and enhance the hill spirit. You can't remove it... who? You must not remove it. Who are you? I am the God of this land. You must not remove the book! Why? The Monkey turns into demon. He is no good. He can turn the world upside down. No one could stop him. He messed both Dragon and Sky Palace. Even Yu-Huang Emperor can't stop him. lt's hard for Buddha Ru-laito keep himthere. lfyou release him, You'll getinto bigtrouble. Mentor... Mentor... Look. Mentor, don'tlistento him You God, getting in myway. l'll give you ahardtime when l am out. He is so powerful even when he's inside. lt'll be worse if I release him. Old man... Let me ask you, I am not your enemy, why do you want to suppress me? He is kind. He's afraid you can't change If we release you, the world will be a mess. Mentor, I was really bad-tempered. Didn't take Yu-Huang Emperor seriously. In these 500 years, I learnt my lesson. I experienced hard times & learnt to be good. If Mentor releases me, I promise to be good and start a new life. You sure know how to talk sweet But it's always hard to change. Old man, how dare you bluff! Mentor... l have done wrong once 500 years ago, and will l never be excused? Mentor, l beg for your kindness. Give me one chance. lf you release me, l will repay you for your kindness. Everyone has sin. lf you realise you're wrong l will give you a chance Hang on... No kidding. Let me leave before you remove it. l took Buddha's orderto suppress Monkey. Now that the imprisonment is over you and mentor will be together again. Mentor... Mentor... l was tired of the 500 years of captivity Now all of a sudden, l feel so free. Mentor, you saved me. l will remember your kindness forever. Be good, stop being wild. Start a new life. Follow me to the West for the Script. Obtaining it'd mean more than just being monks. l'll remember Mentor's teachings l'll strive to protect you to get the Scripture Though there are hills and mountains ahead, it will not affect our relationship. Great. Here onwards, we might experience ups & downs but we won't return without the Script. Sure, Mentor. Apprentice, please help me down. Mentor, your stick is still hung at the hill l will pick it up foryou. Apprentice, what's yourname? My name is Monkey. Since you've shown interest in Buddhism, l'll name you as ''Walker''. Thank you Mentor. lt's getting late now. Change back to your normal form, let's go. Yes Mentor. l can do a flip that reaches thousand miles Let me carry you. Three flips and we'll reach the West. Sure. Let's go. Mentor, why don't you hold onto me? You're powerful, but l'm jus tan ordinary monk... Can't reach the skyin just one flip like you Are we walking to the West,without a horse? We've to suffer to get the Script. lf we have faith,we can make it. Apprentice, if we can'tfinish in 10 years, 20 years then. lf we can't do it in 20 years, 30 years then. Yes, we'll surely reach the West. Apprentice, come on let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Where is the monster? Monkey, you can't kill. Master, help! You can't fight with him, you mustn't. Mentor, stay back. You'll break the rules if you kill. lt's the commandments. You'd better go. Monkey. Mentor,why do you let him go? lf l let him go, he might not hurt me. lf you don't kill him, he'll kill you. You are freeing a tiger! Stop, kindness is key to Buddhism. How can you break the rules to kill. l got nothing in return out of my kindness. Okay, if you're friendly with the monsters, l can't protect you to the West. l'd better go back to Hill of Flower& Fruit. Come back. lf you're not suffering with me, it's fine. Butl hope you'd learnt from your mistakes and it deserved my effort saving you. You'd bette rgo. l need to rush too. Mentor, take care. Be good. May Buddha bless you. Dragon monster, freeze. Mentor... Monkey... Mentor... Monkey... Mentor, are you scared? You came at the rightmoment. That Monster is really powerful. Do you know him? No. Come and have alook. lt's you. l knew that if you didn't kill him, he would pounce on you. Mentor, you understand now. l didn't realize he would do that in return. Aren't you back to Hill of Flower & Fruits? Why are you coming back? l knew this monster has bad intentions. How could l put you in danger? l followed Mentor all along, protecting you from behind. You are my good apprentice. Although l'm bad-tempered, l can distinguish between good and bad. l'll be loyal to Mentor from now on to protect you. Good, let us be together forever. Yes, Mentor. You are pretty miserable. lf you'll promise to be good, l'll let you go! What? You want to let him go? We monks practice kindness. Why do you want them to die? See...you're making the same mistake. You've forgotten the key to the problem. No, l must kill this bad guy. Stop. You dare not hurt him, and l won't treat you as my apprentice. l don't have such Mentor,too. Sure, since we always have arguments, you should go your own way. l will go formine. We'll just strive for our own future. Monkey, stay. Monkey, how can you give up? Guan-Yin Buddha l didn't get along with him. That's easy. l will give you one thing. You'll get along with each other well. What? lt's nice. Do you like it, l'll give it to you. You'd give that to me? lt will fit your head, try it. lt fits. Buddha Even if l wore this, it will not change Mentor's mistakes. But it can change your mistakes. A medical treatment is written on this jade. lt'll cure Monkey's bad-temper. Read it out, see if it works. Enough, stop reading. Buddha, what treatment is this? The Binding Curse controls your temper. l don't want this lousy thing. You can't take it out. lt has been stuck on your head. Protect your Mentor to the West. Bring the Scripture and return. l will remove it for you. You asked me to wear this lousy thing. l could better die. l'm not going. Monk Tang, read again. Don't read... l'll go. l'll go. Yes, you should move on. Thank you Buddha. Buddha, l think we'll never reach the West. How come? Mentor is a layman. Are you asking him to walk without a horse? l have made some arrangements. Prince Third of West Dragon King l am here. You've broken the commandments. King Jade could've chopped your head off. l should keep you at the Ying-Chou gully. But if you could do me a single favour, you can make up for your deeds. Do you want to go with Tang for the Script? lf l can make up for my wrong deeds, l'd like him to be my Mentor. Protect him to the West. Okay, l'll turn you into a horse. Hope you bear with that and go with them. Monkey, there is along way to the West. lt's tough... Since you are more senior, you should take better care of Mentor. l know. l'll give you ''Confident''. Thank you, Buddha. With Confident, you'll solve all problems. Take care. Mentor, look. This family is having a celebration. Monkey, go and get some food. Let's eat. Yes, Mentor. Let's rest for a while. Sure. Master. Master, you'd always be kind. Ming has got a good daughter-in-law. Go!
