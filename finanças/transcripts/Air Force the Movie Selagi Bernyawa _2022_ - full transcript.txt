The peace and well-being enjoyed today was not easily achieved,... ...but through the sacrifices of heroes who gave their lives to... ...protect the country. We hold steadfast to our vow as warriors to defend the country's... ...sovereignty, security and interest, till our last breath. Namburi. A volatile country in the Pacific Ocean. For five years, the northern and southern Namburi have been at war. Then a ceasefire was called in Namburi just four months ago. Humanitarian missions are accompanied by PASKAU,... ...deployed to Namburi for a peace-keeping mission... ...during the ceasefire. Today, the ceasefire in Namburi has ended. They must return home to avoid being trapped in this civil war. The ceasefire in the Namburi Civil War... ...has reached a dead end. The Southern Namburi separatist militants... ...now control more than half of Namburi. They kill anyone siding with the Northern Namburi military. Meanwhile, the Northern Namburi military... ...are on the hunt for the Southern Namburi separatists. Women and children are not spared as victims of this civil war. The international community provided humanitarian aid... ...during the ceasefire. Malaysia has also sent its humanitarian delegation,... ...with help from The Royal Malaysian Air Force. However, the violence in Namburi persisted. Death toll has reached..... Pause here. Fighting has resumed. Everyone has left, except us. Rewind that for me. The ceasefire has ended. All foreigners are advised to leave the country immediately. I repeat, the ceasefire has ended. All foreigners are advised to leave the country immediately. Come on, guys! Move it! Are these the only footages available? It's inside there. -Open the inserted folder. Open in? It's time to leave. Enough, we'll resume editing it in Kuala Lumpur. Let's go. When will we depart, Adib? Everyone else has already left. We're the only ones left. Don't be late. Rock, coming in hot. Over. Copy that. Bravo! Weapons ready! Move to the gate now! Go! Go! Go! Here we go again. Come on, girls! Go! Go! Go! They're after us! Hurry! Open the gate! Go, Hujan! Go, Hujan! Go, go, go! Close the gate! Close the gate! -Adib, hold the line! Yes, sir! -Paco, jump in! Closed! You're dead, foreign traitors. Everyone stand down. We'll wait till they leave. Okay, let's go! Susan! -Bring the stretcher! Put him down. -Are you okay? Press down on the wound! He's Southern militant. He brings danger. -How long has he been like this? Help me, come on. -Move! Yes, sir! -Now! Hey, move, move! Help Susan! I'll do my best... ...but this is the last time. He's gone. Hey, don't record. -Excuse me? We're just doing our job, sir. -Don't try to sensationalize this. I want to show the truth. Everyone out. We are about to leave. Hurry. Now. We don't have time for all this, sir. What would you have done in my shoes? Although he's a child, he is still human. Have you forgotten your principles as a PASKAU? You shouldn't have saved that boy. You've possibly made enemies with the most dangerous militia... ...of Namburi. -I know what I did, my brother. Adib. My advice, destroy that. Paco! -Sir! Hujan! Pilot, this is Loadmaster. Scan check completed. Cabin secured. Everything settled? You hate our army that much? Angkasa 1-1, ready for taxi. Hey, look at this. "Fighter jet fly low, civilian file suit". What is your problem, Zaf? Always with your "beat-up". Take off. -Stabilise. Man Toga SRS autothrust armed. Checked. Power set. Positive climb. Gear up. -Gear up. Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! -Shoot! Shoot! Shoot the traitors. -Yes, sir. Passing one zero thousand. Missile. Missile. Sir, spike at 4 o'clock. -Set countermeasure. Ready on my go. -Countermeasure ready, sir. Seatbelt sign on. Drop! Flare! Flare! Flare! We grew up together. We grew up sharing the same dream. Dream of flying together. Every struggle surely has a beginning. Every beginning surely starts with a choice. Left, right, left. Adib. There. That's Captain Adnan. I heard a story he once rescued over 50 refugees. Isn't that crazy? He's the youngest PASKAU... ...bestowed with the Pahlawan Gagah Berani medal. When did you take this photo with Hana? It's an old photo. When were you planning to tell me? I really wanted to tell you but I didn't want to get you upset. Of course I'm upset, Adib. We've vowed to fly together. What is this? -If you want to fly, go ahead. That's your dream. -It was our promise, Adib. Come here. -Whatever. Forgive me, Zaf. We both have different paths. This is my journey. Here. Wow. Now, this is wife material. You're so full of it, Adib. Hang on, I'll go get my identity card. Where to, Komando? What with you, Zaf, snapping at me like this? Why are you still upset with me? You fly, I'm with PASKAU. We each have our own strengths. Are you dating Hana? Yes, I'm dating Hana. Is there a problem? -The problem now is... ...you're dating my sister secretly, behind my back. I knew it. You are still pissed at me for joining PASKAU, right? Don't drag Hana into this. It's not about that, Adib. You are fickle. I don't want my sister to get hurt. Can you guys stop it? Whether you're a pilot or PASKAU, it shouldn't matter. You've been friends since childhood, why fight about it? Zaf, please respect my choice, whomever I chose to be with. Please respect Zaf. Like it or not, Zaf is my brother... ...and might be your brother-in-law. "Might be"? -Yes, "might be". Enough, Zaf, we're on a date. From then on, me and Zaf were never on good terms. Our differences... ...will eventually come to pass. That's my hope. Taking off. We are here for a reason,... ...not by chance. If you choose to fight,... ...never ever back down. Keep on fighting as long as we live. Understand? -Understood, sir! Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! This is Angkasa 1-1, we have been shot! Bail out! Bail out! Come on, the ramp! Go, go, go! Missile. Missile. We got them. Good. Now, go kill all the survivors. Send the death squad to take over the tunnel. Move! Understood. Go to the tunnel and kill all traitors from the south. Go now! Okay, Mantis. Exercise completed... ...but your category is still under review. Take us back to base. We will wait for the engineering reports. All the best, Mantis. -Roger that, sir. Let's return to base. Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! This is Angkasa 1-1! We've been shot! We've been shot! Bail out! Bail out! We get ready for all possibilities. Open all communication line. Get the approval from higher authority. Activate search and rescue. Let's bring them home. Well done, chap. Good to go? -Yes. Let's go. -Let's move. Come on. Natrah. Nat, we got to go now. Okay? We got to go now. Come on. Let's go! Paco? What are you doing, Paco? Who is that? Who is this kid? Paco. Paco. I've tried my best. I think these are corpses of villagers from the east side. The militants must've done this. These people were supposed to go... ...to the airbase for yesterday's supplies. They're East Siders. What else do they want? Our sortie just now was good. The recent case wasn't even your fault. Hey, Lowball! This place is for pilots who can really fly,... ...not for those with fake licenses. Pal, an A400 went missing this morning in Namburi! Isn't your brother-in-law there? Paco. Rock. Go, let's go. Sir. Matno, you okay? You okay? -Take off your bright jacket. Take it off now! They should be nearby! Find them! Is everyone okay? Hey, hey. Move. -Go, go, go. Sir. Why are you here, Mantis? I know what happened, sir. I am requesting to be part of this mission, sir. Your case is still under investigation, you know that. But I'm the best fighter pilot you have, sir. And you know it. -We'll discuss it some other time. Not now. You're dismissed. Mantis, you've breached the SOP... ...with an unauthorised... ...low flying. We'll do a standard check flight. In the meantime,... ...your category is suspended. Your flight status will also depend on the BOI report. So, you're the one handling my case? You enjoy deciding the fate of others? Let me ask you this. Who decides your fate? Me or this Sukhoi? Or is it on you? We are being hunted. Only the Northern Namburi... ...military owns surface-to-air missiles. Our mission, find assets and weapons. We are here now. Find any remaining survivors and also the A400 data pack. It's the only proof we have. Only then, we move towards airbase. Wait for rescue. Move quietly. Then we'll go back to Kuala Lumpur? I promise everyone will get home safely... ...to Kuala Lumpur. Get me the latest satellite images. Sir, Zafran volunteered himself for this mission. However, he has a case under investigation. I think he is the best pilot we have for this mission, sir. I recommend we give a fair chance to all our pilots,... ...including Zafran. Let them prepare the mission plan. I agree. Proceed. Thank you, sir. Down. Gaban, no! He's just a child! Why didn't you shoot? -They are not far. Find them! Rock. Lejen, we have to split. Stick to the original plan. -Hujan, here's your beacon. Beacon on, so we can be tracked. Move to the crash site. Shut it, shut it. What's that sound? Go find it! Lay low. Wait. Rock, grenade! Rock, okay? -Okay! Paco! -Okay, Lejen! Tuai! -Are you okay? Okay. -Are you guys okay? Clear! -Up. Go, go. -You go. Guys, keep searching. Lejen. Come here, go, go. Go. Hujan, whose watch made that noise? Whose watch? Tuai, stop it! -Say it. Your watch. -Lejen! If you mess with me once again,... ...I shall kill you myself. Get it? Stop it! -Got it, sir. Tuai! Lejen! Over here! -Tuai! Stop it! Matno. We're stuck here, Matno. I don't want to die here, Natrah. As long as we stay together. Lejen, the militants are here on trucks. They're at the bottom. Lejen, I've found the data pack. Good. Paco, change into the militant's outfit. Tell Hujan to do it too. We move to airbase... ...on truck. Understand? Understood. -Move. Commander. The Government has ordered us to proceed with our plan. Sure, Dato' Sri. I will go to Charlie Cube later. Yes, Dato' Sri. That's our true enemy, sir. We need to move fast. To achieve such speed, we need to fly light. Hence, we must revise our weapon configuration. To avoid detection, we must fly low, sir. Sir. Negative to fly low. We go full force. This is my mission plan. Matno. I entrust this to you. Keep this data pack safe... ...as if it's your own life. That's the only proof we have. Yes, sir. This is Angkasa 1-1, come in. This is Angkasa 1-1, come in. They got away. Be careful, everyone. This is South Namburi camp area. Those are Northern armies. Paco. Are you serious? What do you plan to do with this child? We'll take her to the airbase. I can take care of this kid, Tuai. Focus! Focus! Rock, move, Rock! Rock, move, Rock! It's them! It's them! Move! Move, Rock! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Down! -Down! Guys, weapons out! Incoming! -Cover! Hujan, Gaban, cover! You guys okay? -Yeah. There's blood! There's blood! She's bleeding. Matno, help. Put pressure on her neck. Press! I can't feel anything. I can't feel anything. Lejen, we will continue to safe area. Sir, we've received new information. They're from the satellite feed. Sir, based on their movement, this is our men. There's a four hour difference between their location and ours. It's almost night there. We must act fast. A400M standby for combat deployment. Once we get aerial pictures from our AWACS in Namburi,... ...we'll identify missile sites,... ...then you guys do the rest. Understood? Yes, sir! -Yes, sir! Negative, it's not working. You must try to get a signal, Hujan. I'm trying. -Until you get it. If you had shot the kid,... ...Susan would still be alive. Will you stop chewing? Is there something wrong with your Commanding Officer? What do you mean? He promised to keep us all safe. We didn't ask for this to happen. It just did. We trust Major Adnan. I hope you will too. Trust should be earned,... ...not given. Natrah, there's blood. Not my blood. Burn down this place! Move! Lejen, we have to change route so the enemy can't track us. Everyone move. This is too open. The A400M plane which disappeared from radar... ...is feared to have crashed. The RMAF is gathering more information. They should have passed through here. Burn this place down! Hurry! We need to turn back. We've just passed the roadblock. We can't turn back. We've got to press on. You want to go through this area? -Help! Hey. Help! Lara, my child! Paco! -Paco! Paco! Paco! Paco! -Help! Help! -Adib. Paco! Come on! Is Lara safe? Lara is safe. Paco. I know him, uncle, but... ...I still haven't gotten any information. I'm sorry. Excuse me. -Be patient. We've been waiting long. Hana. -Zaf, I want to know... ...what happened to Adib. Why is it nobody knows anything? All of us are still waiting, Hana, including Zaf. Waiting for what, Zaf? -We still don't know... ...the situation there. Maybe there are still..... Still what, Zaf? What happened? -We don't have information. Are they safe or not? -It's too soon to tell. Sir, what's going on? Who's safe and who's not, sir? Do you know something? -Be patient. Tell us, sir. -Please, sir! Be patient. Have patience, please. -How can we be patient? I'm sorry, everyone. I'm not an officer assigned for this mission. Any information... ...will be relayed by the higher authority. I apologize. Sir! How long must we wait? Zaf! Zaf! Zaf. I know you guys haven't been closed. But I'm begging you, Zaf. Bring Adib back. Lejen. Please clear this. Why did Paco do that? That's his child. His daughter has long been gone. Paco accidentally ran over his daughter. So, he can't forgive himself. Orders? Stick to the original plan. We head to airbase. Do we have to go through this? That can't be. Tunnel. -Lejen, I don't think... ...the tunnel is our best choice. You want to go through this? It's the only choice we have. Hujan. -Yes? Call airbase, request for an update on the tunnel. Quick. -Okay. Lejen, I suggest we move to higher ground... ...and try to make contact. The tunnel is too dangerous. We don't know what's inside. We can't expose ourselves. The tunnel is our best choice. -But Lejen..... Stick to the plan. Lejen, negative. Whatever happens, you guys stay close to me. Sir. Display it on the screen later. -Sure, sir. Good job, Layla. Good job. According to our intel, the survivors are located... ...on high ground nearby the Namburi Airbase. We believe they will access the tunnel... ...to avoid the militants. The enemy is equipped with surface-to-air missiles... ...dan the MiG-29 fighter jets. Suit up and be ready for Mission Hornbill. Yes, sir! -Yes, sir! Status update, we've reached FOB 0300, sir. Very well. What's the latest satellite imagery? AWACS? -Sir. Latest update, sir. -Okay, standby. I'll show you the latest image. Mantis. Sir. We've agreed to follow your flight plan. So,... ...you will lead this operation. Yes, sir. Mantis. Their fate in Namburi now rests in your hands. Don't let them down. God willing, sir. I will do my best. Thank you, sir. Bring them home. Sir. Your plan has been authorized. Low flying and all. -Their fate lies with us, Spoon. For us, it's zero... ...or hero. Come. -We have work to do now. They are inside. -Go in. Come here, woman! Don't resist! Grenade! Take cover! Hujan! Take cover! Gaban! Check on Hujan! Bring this girl. Lejen! Sir. Let's go. Useless. Let's go! Rock. Enemy. Take cover! -Gaban, take six! Rock! Tuai! -Move! Tuai! We've got company! Cover, Gaban! Tuai! Let's die together! Pass me the bag. Go. Rock. Airbase, this is Angkasa 1-1. Do you copy? I repeat. Airbase, this is Angkasa 1-1. Do you copy? Airbase? Lejen, airbase has been compromised. Let's go. Lejen. Find weapons that we can use. Get the MiG-29 ready for flight. Tuai. How much ammo left? -Limited. How's airbase? -Compromised. Order? Lejen? Lejen, we need to secure the perimeter here. Are you okay? -I'm okay. Check on the others. What bracelet is that, sir? A gift from my son. During his therapy. He's autistic. I did my best. Adib joined PASKAU because of me. It's not easy to be a leader. I have failed. Sir, you haven't failed. You saved me. I should be eating a burger right now,... ...watching Blu-ray,... ...gaming. Anyway,... ...I'm still stuck here. I'm amazed at how you guys can do this. We became PASKAU... ...so everybody else don't have to go through this. I too have a habit when I'm stressed. Biting your nails? -When I'm stressed,... ...I fart. No wonder it smells. Are you okay, Matno? Okay. My bag is not, though. Lejen, we are ready to move. I am sorry. I've made the wrong decision. Sir. What has happened wasn't yours or anyone's fault. It's fated. But what I've learnt from someone I respect is... ...to continue. Continue to live. Fight for those we leave behind. They pray for our strength, sir. Don't let them down. As long as we live. Rock. I think I've found an exit. There's a door. Okay. Gaban. Surveillance sensors ready, sir. Support element ready, sir. Fighter formation ready, sir. Local weather good, sir. Okay, guys. Operation Hornbill is a go! Naga Formation, F18, requesting to take off. Mantis. All the best, pal. Thanks, buddy. We're okay? There are more important things than our egos. We're okay.

Bring Lejen and the civilians to a safe location and take cover. Okay. Hujan. -Yes. Come with me. We'll go to a higher ground to make contact. I will find you guys later. Now, move! Lejen, sir.
