(phone beeping) - It's my sister, Frances, probably just calling to see if I paid her rent. - You pay her rent? - Yeah. She's kinda like the black sheep of the family. Didn't go to college, can't keep a job, you know the story. - Every family has one. (Sydney chuckling) Well, I don't think you helpin' her. - What are you saying, I shouldn't help my sister? - Nah, I'm saying, how's she ever gonna learn to stand her own two when she got you as a crutch? - That's a good point. I'll think about that while I'm in the shower. (soft music) - I think I'll take me a shower too.

I ain't got that many minutes left so I have to make this quick. - So what's up, baby girl? - I need to borrow $300. - And if it was $300, me would have spin you. What ya need it for? - You know that contest they had to win a jam in Jamaican summer weekend? - Yeah. Yeah. Me did call them ras people out there, trying. - I won. - Three days, two nights in a four-star hotel plus free brunch, lunch, and dinner. You're lucky. - Hot fun in the summertime, girl. - And a mandem? - Hold that thought. I got a call on the other line. What it do? - Is that any way to answer a phone? - [Frances] Sydney. - I just got out of the shower. I saw I missed your call. - Look, I need to talk to you, but I got somebody on the other line. I'll call you back. - Well, call them back. - I was talking to them first. - Well, which is more important? Your sister who pays your rent, or then bummy ass bitches you be hanging out with? - I'll call you back. (phone beeping) Sorry. That was my sister, the sex offender. - What she is? - Sex offender. Every guy that fucks her is offended. - Fuck the family affair. Now tell me what a go on in your yard, - Okay, I'm gonna tell you. So the last night after the concert, I'm at the hotel bar getting my late night drink on, thinking about not bringing my unemployed ass back to LA and... - And don't tell me. A dread lock rasta walks in. - Dreads down his back. Skin like black coffee wearing white linen and a six pack to die for. - You want me to give you money to go back a yard to go find your bombo rassclat man? - No, I need to borrow some money to get an abortion. - Frankie, you never used protection? - I fucked up, didn't I? - No more than nobody else, baby girl. - Can you help me? - Frankie, you know if me did have it, you would have get it. But my money is funny. And you know every penny I make go into my mother lawyer. - Thanks any who. I got to go. I ain't got that many minutes left and I gotta trace this paper. - Well, keep the faith on. Everything soon all right. All right? So later. (upbeat music) - [Sydney] What's up, Jordan? - Okay. Tell me who he is. - Who, who is? - We talk every day, sometimes two or three times a day. The only time we don't talk is when you either break up with a guy or meet a new guy. So who's your new love of the minute? - This is gonna last more than a minute. In fact, I wanna make it permanent. - That's dangerous for chicks like us. (phone ringing) - Sydney Michaels. Hello? Hello? - Hi. Sorry to bother you at work, but I was hoping that you had a few minutes so that we could talk sister to sister. - That's pretty much all I have, sister to sister. What is it you want, Frances? - I need to borrow $300. - What's it for? - Does it matter? - You're asking me for $300. Yes, it matters. - Will you give it to me if I tell you? - One thing's for sure. I won't if you don't. - I'm pregnant and I need to take care of it. - By whom? - Nobody you know. - Well, if you're not gonna to tell me, why don't you ask him for the money? - I can't because I don't know. - Jesus, you're fucking so many guys, you don't know who knocked you up? - I know who it is! I was there. Okay? Give me some credit. I just don't know his last name or how to get in touch with him. It happened while I was on vacation. - You know what? This is a good life lesson for you. It'll teach you to be more responsible. - I am responsible! I don't need a life lesson. What I need is $300. Are you gonna give it to me or not? - Not. - Thank you. You've been real helpful. (headset beeping) (upbeat music) (Lovely humming) (door knocking) (upbeat music) - [Lovely] Mr. Corbin. - I'm terribly sorry for not calling. I hope I didn't catch you at a bad time. - No, man. What happened to your phone, it lock off? I've been calling. - Yes. I currently relocated my office. But rest assured, your case will be handled with the utmost care. You wouldn't happen to have any hot sauce, would you? - Yeah. (upbeat music) - I normally keep a bottle of hot sauce at my apartment, but my wife got it in the divorce. (upbeat music) Immigration law is a very lucrative occupation. Keeps me very busy so I gotta eat when I can. - Speaking of which, how my mother case a go? - Very good. It's moving like a freight train. Just zooming down the tracks. It shouldn't take no more than another six months. You two will be together. - Six months? - Things have slowed down a bit since 9/11. Homeland Security tripping. Acquiring a visa isn't as easy as it used to be. - You don't understand. My mother, she's dying. I promised her I'd get her here. - There may be a way we can work this out. These INS people have been known to be a little motivated. - How much? - $5,000 will probably expedite the process. - $5,000? I don't have that type of money there. Between your attorney fees and me mother medical bills, I'm doing the best I can not to get evicted. - I wanna do whatever I can to help. (dramatic music) - You gon' help me? - No, you're gonna help yourself. But the question is, what are you willing to do?

(Corbin moaning) (Corbin panting) (upbeat music) - Did you get the file from Channing? - Yeah, it's on the back seat. (upbeat music) - Didn't I see this guy on the news, a rapist or something? - Pedophile, but he was never convicted. Forget him. Did Channing tell you he wanted to make me his number one motivational speaker? - Better you than me. I hate that shit. But if you're good at it, maybe you can talk some sense into my stupid ass sister. - You know, not everyone has a new piece at home like you. - My new piece has a name. Leonard Williams. - Is Mr. Williams gainfully employed? - He's a mechanic. He fixed the Mercedes. - That's not all he fixed. Blue collar. There you go slumming again, Sydney. - There you go being judgmental. Not all men have to have a six figure income to be appealing. - Says who? - It's not about the money. If a guy can just be nice nowadays, that's a leap in the right direction. - [Jordan] You're right. Good men are few and far between. - I didn't know lesbians thought about that type of shit. - I am not a lesbian. I am bisexual. And yes, we do think about things like that. What do you think, I want to be an old, bitter dyke? - You're going in that direction. - Bullshit! I like dick. Some good dick. As a matter of fact, now you're just connected to a thick bank roll. - It's more than sex with us. - [Jordan] Bitch, you tell it. - It is. You wouldn't believe what he did on our first date. - What, show up late with a six pack of beer and a video? - He sang to me. - Get out of here. Okay. So he has the pipes of life. But what other the type of pipe does he have? - Wouldn't you like to know? - Yes, and if you don't tell me, Imma run us off this road. ♪ You got a style, you got a taste, girl, taste girl ♪ ♪ And if you was mine, I would keep you laced, girl ♪ ♪ So you do your thing, girl ♪ ♪ You doing your thing, doing your thing ♪ ♪ Doing your thing, yeah ♪ ♪ Do your thing, girl ♪ ♪ You doing your thing, doing your thing ♪ ♪ Doing your thing, yeah ♪ ♪ This goes out to my hot style mamas ♪ ♪ Whose fit game has been dressing hot style on us ♪ ♪ Rocking your red Dolce and Gabbana ♪ ♪ Has got a pair with your Christian, Louis Vuittons ♪ ♪ Mani pedi with your hair did ♪ ♪ You a fashionista, you got it, ma ♪ ♪ I could tell from your Givenchy, Prada, Balenciaga ♪ - You realize the little taste I had was on the house?

(dramatic music) (water running) - So you finally go and crack that FedEx piggy bank? What you gon' buy, another house? - Nope. I'm getting out. - You gonna take that vacation finally? I hear that. But you should have enough stash for what, two or three dozen vacations. - I mean, out of the game. - This is a joke, right? - How do you figure? - Let me put it into perspective. You've been playing the role of motivational speaker but really putting down scores for Channing for, what? - Ever since I failed the bar exam. Five years. A month in a month out. - Right. And beyond the fact that you don't know how to do shit else, what makes you think Channing's even gonna let you out? - Channing and I are like sisters. - What does it have to do with the price of pussy on Sunset? - I want to have Leonard's children. I pulled all of my money out of the bank. Leonard and I are going to the Cayman Islands tonight. - There you go. Thinking with your clit again. Channing know this? - I'm gonna tell her when I deliver the chips and the books. - Good luck with that. - Imma be good, girl. (slow music) - Good. Very good. You guys did good. (drink pouring) (glass clanking) So you want to talk about it? - It? - Yes, it. You wanna retire. - How did you know? - I know the look. I've seen it in the mirror before. Why? - I met someone. - A man? - A good man. Leonard Williams. - [Channing] The mechanic. (dramatic music) - I love him. - Let's see, my little love bird. You made 300,000 last year and whatever you and Jordan skimmed off each hit. 67,000 in the bank. Another 140,000 in stocks and bonds. And last week, they approved your black card. So let me ask you again. Why? (dramatic music) I didn't know what I was going to do after I failed the bar exam. And you brought me in and you made me a part of something special. And it's not that I'm ungrateful for that. It's just that I'm... - In love. - Yeah. - You know, if you love this man and he loves you, leave tonight and never come back. - Thank you. (dramatic music) - Go. (dramatic music) (crickets chirping) (slow music) - Leonard? - Sydney. Sydney. - Hey, you're up. - Yeah. Man, that chicken soup you gave me worked. (slow music) - Can we talk? - I mean, I was about to go take a shower, but what's wrong? Bad day? - I have something to ask you. It's the most important question in my life right now. - Aiit. - Do you love me? - Come on. That's a silly question. Of course I love you. I've told you I love you. Yes, baby. I love you. - Do you love me enough to go to the Cayman Islands tonight? - Wait, I don't understand. What about your job? - I quit. Now will you go with me? - You quit? - Yeah. - You wanna go now? - I've got two plane tickets and a car will be here in an hour. - Sounds like you already made a decision. Of course I'll go with you. Yes. (Sydney inhaling sharply) (dramatic music) (Leonard breathing heavily) You going now. - I loved you. - I know. I know. (slow music) - She retired. - Yup. Got her retirement fund right here. - Good work. - I do what I do. - It's a shame though. I think I loved her. - Just not as much as you love money. (Channing snapping fingers) - Let's go. (somber music) (upbeat music) - See, I'm telling you, girl. A nigga hit you once, them go and hit you again. - But he said he didn't even mean it. It was an accident. - The first man that accidentally beat him and see how him like it. - Hey, y'all remember Jordan. She worked with Sydney. - Yeah, I remember seeing you at the funeral. - Well, I see you're all moved in and you let your girls here and all. - Yeah. You know, we doing our thing. Jordan brought over some photos to add to the scrapbook. Can I get you something to drink? - Yeah. Whatever y'all drinking is cool. So what's going on? - Out there fighting lines with switches. - And talking about these tired ass niggas. You can't live with them and you can't live without 'em. - You need to learn how to live without Maurice if you don't want to end up in a hospital. - [Tasha] Maurice said he was sorry. - I'd be sorry too if I didn't have no place to stay. I don't know why you let him live with you in the first place. - But Maurice isn't all bad. In the beginning, he was real cool. - Correct. Cool in the beginning. It's what I'm saying in the long run you must worry about. - Besides, ain't no woman gon' get with no man that starts off acting a damn fool. - It has to do with the guy's parents. If he sees the father beating the mother, he thinks that's how it's supposed to be. - Now that's a woman that knows about a man. - I don't know. Them sound like excuses to me. They know right from wrong. I don't know what you saw in him. This is a classic case of domestic violence. - Maurice was funny. He knew how to make me laugh. Told me this crazy joke the other day. What's that useless flesh around a lesbian's pussy called? - I give up, what? - A lesbian (laughs). - Okay. Well, you know what? I got to get up early, so Imma go. - Okay. Thanks for coming. I'll show you out. - Now, see, why did you have to say that? I told you what Sydney said about her getting with girls. - I forgot. Y'all should've gave me the heads up she was gay. - Like what? Hey, everybody. This is Jordan, Sydney's friend, who eats pussy. You need to learn how to be politically correct girl. - One random comment and now I'm gay bashing. - See, now I'm gonna call and apologize for you. - Well, somebody needs to teach me about this girl thing. - Maybe they have classes about it. Dyke 101. - I'm not gonna remember that. Can you write that down for me? What? I'll write it down myself. - I just got this new job. Imma fuck around and lose it over this shit. - [Cuz] What are you talking about? - Cuz, man, caught a domestic violence case. - [Cuz] Trifling ass bitches. Always trying to keep the black man down. - Right. - [Cuz] That's why I only date white girls. - Nigga, what? You already know me. I had to put my pin pan down. - [Cuz] That's right. - I hate a bitch can't take a punch. - [Cuz] You used the smack a bitch method? - Trick ass bitch wasn't complaining the other night when I was smacking that ass while I was running up in her. - [Cuz] Fuck me. Spank me. Pull my hair. - Right. I love that shit, yo. - [Cuz] I feel you, dog. - Man, I'm telling you, next time I should just kill the bitch. One side of the story, easy to tell. You feel me, my nigga? - [Cuz] You should have did her OJ style. - Hell yeah. Yo man, she ain't answering anyway. Imma just raise up out of here. Imma hit you back later. - [Cuz] Aiit, dog. - Aiit. - [Cuz] I'll hall at you. - One. - [Tasha] How'd you get in here? - You changed the apartment locks, but I still got my building key. - Not anymore you don't. - Tasha. I came all the way down here and bought you a present. Smell that. That's something that will head bank a bookie straight to your brain type shit. Let's twist one up and do what we do. Come on. What you say? - So you just come down here all blasting and I'm supposed to forget about how you slapped me around? - Didn't I say I was sorry? Ain't that enough? I thought we been through this. - You beat my ass. No, it's not enough. And something's really wrong with you if you think that it should be. - Aiit, then. Be that way, bitch. Act pretty if you want to. You ain't that fucking fine anyway. I got mad bitches blowing up my phone trying to get with. Fuck around with this bitch. Yo, Lisa. (Lisa speaking in foreign language) - I've been thinking about you, baby. (mellow music) - And no other girl this up? You can't do it. - I can never get those dances. I appreciate you staying over. Being here is still a little weird for me. - A little glass of liquor. I'm here. - For sure. Look, we all know Tasha a little dingy, but that shit she told Jordan was right out there. - And you see how the girl get stuck up and left? I don't know how that was your sister's friend. You know say, I see her at the funeral, and she don't even speak. - It's funny you should mention that. Because the last time Sydney and I spoke, we argued. - About the $300 something? - Yeah. - It's probably why it happened. No, man. A bad joke me a make. I'm sorry. - Don't apologize. There's a lot you didn't know about Sydney. She had a side to her. And although she treated me like shit when she was alive, she left me everything. House, the car, money in the bank. - Okay, so Sydney was a tough pill to swallow. But you see, everyone have them good points. It's just a shame she had to die to learn about hers. - Yeah. - Empty. - Shit, we out. Sydney got something up in here. - She must have some liquor about the place. - She used to hide it from me. - And what that, a portable liquor cabinet? - Damn, sister. What the hell were you into? - Apparently, there's a whole lot you didn't know about Sydney either. (slow music) (doorbell ringing) (slow music) (water splashing) (slow music) - Can I help you? - Tasha Ramsey? - Mm-hmm. - Now this nigga is trying flowers. Hold on, I think you're gonna be taking these back. - [Jordan] Hey, Tasha. I thought I'd sent you some flowers so that you could see that all all us lesbians aren't all useless. - No, I'm good. Thank you. (slow music) - You wanna make money, ladies? You've got to use the talents that God gave you. Because we're talking about what? Being bloated, some new carb diet that isn't working, guy you met at a club stood you up when you wanted a meaningful relationship. Bullshit, right? Let's talk about something important. Sensuous cosmetics, the one vocation created for women by women. Symbolically personified in the form of a convertible Cadillac. And you want that Cadillac, but you can't have it. You wanna know why? Because you're a weak bitch. I have been giving motivational speeches for years and I have never met a sorrier bunch of bitches than yourselves. You can't sell cosmetics. You're not a woman. So take your ass home and serve your husbands' and boyfriends' dinner. Pop a chicken pot pie in the oven or let him pop one in you because if you can't sell sensuous cosmetics, that's all you're good for. Do you think that Madonna and Oprah wake up every morning with your attitude? No. Get out there. Every broad that ever smeared on lipstick is a potential client. Some chick calls you up and asks you, does she need makeup? The question isn't, does she need makeup? It's an essential accessory. A woman needs makeup like she needs shoes. Pretty young thing doesn't ask you to her trailer park unless she wants to buy. She wants to give you her money to make herself beautiful. Define her eyes. Give her cheeks a youthful blush. Let her bask in the glory of sexual glow without the sex. Give her the dream. Because if you can't do that, you better put on your stilettos and hit the pavement, princess, cause you're out of here. And you'll be sitting around a section eight apartment with two fleas sucking your tits to your knees watching cable talking about I'm every woman, when you could have been. (bullets clattering) (phone ringing) - This is Jordan. - Hey, Jordan. - [Jordan] Hey Frankie. So how'd the scrapbook go? - Good. Good. Again, I am so sorry about what Tasha said. She's... - You know what? Don't worry about it. It's no big deal. Besides, I sent her flowers. - You did? Wow. Good for you. - Yeah, it is, isn't it? - I was going through some of Sydney's papers and I was kind of curious as to what kind of work she did. - Well, as a rule, we're into sales, but occasionally, we're asked to give motivational speeches to some of the employees. You know, stimulate them, bring their numbers up. That kind of thing. - Would you know why she'd have a gun? (dramatic music) - Sydney had a gun? - Sydney had lots of guns. - Well, she was your sister. If you don't know, I couldn't tell you. - I thought maybe he had them because somebody was trying to bother her or something. - Listen, Frankie, I gotta get some work done. So if you wanna talk again, just give me a buzz. Okay? - Yeah. Thanks anyway. - Okay. (headset beeping) (dramatic music) (phone ringing) - Aha. - [Jordan] Hey, pretty girl? - Jordan? - I dreamt about you last night. - Tell me I was dressed. - I could, but I'd be lying. You know the thing with girls like you? - [Tasha] Straight girls? - Yeah. - What's the thing with girls like me? - You're fed up with men who treat you like shit, but you're too intimidated to try new things. - [Tasha] What new things? - Women. - [Tasha] That's not exactly new. - Well, you and I are. You like the flowers I sent you? - Yeah. They made me feel good. - Then we'll be safe to say that I made you feel good. - I see where you're going with this. - Then let me go there. I promise you'll feel better than when you got the flowers. - Can you just give me some time to think about this? - Sure. I just gave you five seconds. - This doesn't feel right. Hello? (headset beeping) Hello? Hello, are you there? (slow music) (upbeat music) - Thank you. I ain't mad at you, ma. You sure know how to handle your business. You know what it is? - Shade told me you were special. You put it on me like a champ. You got a real diamond, hard diesel dick and you know what to do with it. - Cold metal specialist, baby. You know how us gangsters do. (lady laughing) - You must watch a lot of videos (laughs). Every nigga that watches videos want to be a gangster. - That's cute. Let me tell you something. Come here. (upbeat music) Now there's two versions of reality. When people tell it to your face, and this one. (lady screaming) This ain't no video trick. (lady gasping) (lady screaming) (doorbell ringing) - Jordan, you shouldn't have come over here. (tense music) You're assuming a lot or practicing to be a Victoria's Secret model. (slow music) - It's cool if you don't want to. (Tasha gasping) But you'd be a fool if you don't want to. (Tasha gasping) - Jordan. Please. Fuck me. (slow music) ♪ Hope you're ready for this ♪ ♪ Hope you can handle this ♪ ♪ Hope you know just what I want from you ♪ ♪ I've been waiting so long ♪ ♪ Feelings getting strong ♪ (slow music) (Tasha moaning) - [Jordan] Is it good to you? - Aha. - [Jordan] Say yes. - Yes. - Yes, ma'am. - Yes, ma'am. - You want some more? - Aha. - More? - Yes. Yes. - I thought you were straight. - No more. - No more, huh? - Uh-uh. - Say no. - No. - No, ma'am. - No, ma'am. (Tasha moaning) - So who do you belong to? - You. - Who? - You! - [Jordan] Who? - You! (Tasha moaning) (slow music) - So how do you feel now? - Better than when I got the flowers. - Well, just for the record, I'm not some pathetic lesbian stalker. - I didn't think you were. - You know the way I showed up at your door. - Aggressive, but a gift from heaven. - Well, there are several religious groups that would disagree with you. So would you still think I was a gift from heaven if I was a man who showed up at your door in his underwear? - I would think you were a stalker. - You smoke a lot? - I could do this for a living. You want a hit? I actually brought something else to party with. (slow music) You want a hit? (slow music) - Yeah. - You ever done this before? - No, but I've done a lot of things tonight I haven't done before. Why stop now? - You sure? (slow music) (glass clanking) (dramatic music) (upbeat music) (phone beeping) (phone ringing) - Yeah? - Wassup, girl? - I don't know. Just trying to figure something out. - Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you for hooking me up with Jordan. - I didn't hook you up with her. You did that all by yourself. - Whatever. So I'm seeing her again tonight. - Second date. - The first day, wasn't really a date. It was more like... - Sex? - [Tasha] Very good sex. - Is there any other kind? - With men there is. - I'm the wrong person to talk to about that. - [Tasha] Because Jordan's gay? - No 'cause she lied to me when I talked to her about Sydney. - How do you know? - [Frances] I don't know. - Well, I can respect that. As long as it's not because you're a new member of the church of I hate gay people. - Starting to feel guilty about my relationship with Sydney. We were never as close as sisters should be. - You should never live your life with regrets. - Then how do I deal with the guilt? - Be more like me. - Get high every day and start dating women? No, thank you. Imma have to talk to somebody else about this. - All right, but when you're done comparison shopping for friends, you can call me back. - Don't worry about your phone. - You do you and I'll do me. - No, Jordan will be doing you. - I know that's right (chuckles).

What a go on? - I just had a quick question. - On Sydney's calendar, it said that you did her hair the day before she went on a date with this Leonard guy. - You know your sister. Love call last minute and act up if I don't take her without an appointment. - Did she ever talk about Leonard? - No, not really, but she did tell me some man named Shade know him. - Who's Shade? - Some tip-looking man used to get him girl hair done at the shop. - You got a number one on him? - Why would I have a pimp's number? - Can you see if you can get a number on him? - I'll ask around at the shop. But me nuh make a promise. - For sure. - All right. Love you, girl. - Hey, sorry I'm late. - You could have called. - I was at work. - They don't have phones where you work? - Look, I'm a grown ass woman and there's a lot of pressures where I... I see you've been busy. - Not really. - They were in the kitchen drawer. Found them when I was looking for the corkscrew for the wine. - You do know I wasn't born yesterday, right? - Yeah. - And although you a virgin to this lifestyle, I wasn't. - Forget it. Let's just eat. - No, not yet. You haven't thanked me for the flowers I gave you. - The flowers you gave me three weeks ago? - Yeah. - I thanked you. - No, you didn't. - What do you want me to do? - Crawl. (Tasha laughing) - You're kidding, right? - No. - You think I'm just gonna... (blows landing) - Crawl, bitch! Crawl! Crawl, bitch! (phone ringing) - Hello? - Hey, Frankie. - Lovely. What time is it? - [Lovely] Late. What ya do, sleep? - Yeah, but it's okay. Is something wrong? - No. Me good. Look, I was just calling. The man, Shade, who you look for, him live at the motel on Third and Main. You know it? - Yeah. Yeah. Good looking out. You sure you all right? - Yeah, man. Don't worry yourself. I'm all right. (birds chirping) (slow music) - Isn't it a little early in the day to be drinking? - Not for what I have to tell you. (slow music) According to Sydney's calendar, she was seeing a guy named Leonard. I checked her charge card and she and Leonard was supposed to get on a plane and fly to the Cayman Islands the night she was killed. She saw this guy almost every day for a month, but he wasn't at the funeral and he hasn't called once. Zero. Nothing. - He's cute, for a guy. Well, what do you think is going on? - I don't know. But I think your girlfriend knows something and I want you to find out what it is. - And I think you need to stop drinking so early in the day. - Why you gotta bring that up? I'm your best friend. - And Jordan's my woman. - Would you take off those goddamn sunglasses? 'Cause I can't believe you're choosing her over me. - My God. Tasha, did Maurice... - I haven't seen Maurice since I hooked up with Jordan. - And where was she when you was getting the shit beat out of you? (slow music) Did that bitch put her hands on you? - Don't call my bitch no bitch. Jesus, we got in an argument. I pushed her buttons. - Don't say it. Do not say that this was your fault. - Don't start with me. Please. (slow music) - I'm not fucking with you for the sake of fucking with you. I'm telling you this because I care. - And I think you think I'm made out of porcelain. - Then what are you gonna do about it? - I love Jordan. - If this was a man, we wouldn't be having this conversation. - You don't have to pretend to be at good friend, Frankie. You are a good friend. I gotta get back. (slow music) (dramatic music) (door knocking) - Economy going to hell in a hand basket. (door knocking) Get the goddamn door, yo. The fuck? You hard of hearing? - I worked last night. - Hi, I'm looking for Shade. - Some bitch for you. (upbeat music) - You hear about the thing? - You're Shade? - I'm the one you wanna be under when the heat is too much for you, Shade. - This look good. - Ayo, what is you doing? - What? - There's money in the street, yo. Get to getting, bitch. Fuck wrong with you? Come on now. Fuck. Ayo, Sunny, don't fucking play with me. I will wipe the floor with yo ass. Should have put her in a goddamn corporation here, fuck. Seen a whole lot of bristles in my day but you nice. You well nice. - Thank you. But... - Ain't no buts, baby. Me and you gon' make a whole lot of money together. Imma be your number one man, right? - I don't... - No, no, no, no, no, no. Don't talk like that. - I think this was a mistake. - Where the fuck you going, bitch? You don't go nowhere unless Shade say you do. - Lovely said... - Lovely? (Shade laughing) - Jody Wallace sent you? - Who? (Shade laughing) - No, Lovely said... What's so funny? - Girl, you ain't got no idea what you almost got. Wasn't nothing nice. Boy. - [Frances] You're crazy. - What can I say? It ain't no shrimp fried rice and newspapers out here. Fuck you want? - You know Leonard Williams? - With the Business? That's what they call them. Anybody that fucks up, he gives him the business end of a sharp knife. High-end pro. - You're friends? - Friends? No, he ain't got no friends. Say, we used to rock back in the day until he put the business on one of my girls. Cut the bitch up so bad, I couldn't even make a dollar off of her. Had to send her ass back to Orange County. - You know where I can find him? - Sure you wanna do that? That building over there through Haney and Wilsher. - That's where my sister worked. - That's what the Business works too. Non-smoking building, they be in the back, blazing it up. I'm telling you right now, he a slick talker. You going after him, you better be careful, or you gon' get the business. - You know where he live at? - You know what?

Are you going somewhere? - One of the girls at the office is having a party so I thought I'd stopped through and show my face. - What else are you gonna show 'em? - Well, what's that supposed to mean? - This is the fourth time this week that you've gone out. - You know what? I don't have to go. It looks like you cooked. Too bad I'm not hungry. - What? - I'm not hungry. - Okay. Don't eat. (dishes clanking) - You either high or out of your fucking mind. Now clean this shit up. - Fuck you, bitch. Clean it up yourself. - No, fuck you, bitch. You obviously don't know who you fucking with. - I don't take this shit from no man and I'm damn sure not gonna take it from you. - Bitch, when I slap you, you'll take it and like it. - I ain't no bitch. (tense music) Fuck you, bitch. - Fuck off me. Crazy ass hoe. (tense music) - Shit. (both groaning) (tense music) - Who's my bitch? Say it or I swear to God I'll break your fucking arm. - I'm your bitch. - [Jordan] What? I didn't hear you. - I'm your bitch. - And don't you ever fucking forget it. (Tasha crying) If it'll make you feel any better, you never had a chance. I'm a professional killer. It's what I do. It's what Sydney did and it's why her boyfriend killed her. And if you ever thinking about leaving me, stop, because I will find you and I will break every bone in your body. (Tasha sobbing) (door knocking) - There she is. How you doing, sweetie? You look great. - You get the something for my mother? - Did I get the visa? (dramatic music) - Lord God. I can't believe it done. - Done? Look, there's no reason to mess up a good thing. - You gon' talk to me, or did somebody else walk in here? - What is that supposed to mean? - Means the days of you pimping me over a long time. I'm done. (dramatic music) - Bitch, you've done when I say you done (groans). Come on. You can't tell me you didn't like it. A different dick for every day of the week. (Corbin groaning) Motherfucker. Stinking bitch. (Corbin gasping) - Mr. Corbin. Mr. Corbin. (dramatic music) This nigga dead. (dramatic music) Yes. Hello? My lawyer, he's having a heart attack. Yes, please hurry. He needs help. (slow music) (phone beeping) - [Frances] Hello? - Hey, girl. It's me. - [Frances] Tasha? - You got time to talk? (slow music) - Damn, Tasha, what happened to your arm? - Girl, I broke it rollerskating. - [Frances] And you didn't call me? - Did you suddenly get a degree in medicine? - If you wanted to talk crazy, we could have did that over the phone. - I didn't want Jordan to know I was talking to you. - Why? She might think I'm trying to get with you? - No, I didn't want her to know that I was going to tell you that your sister, Sidney, was a professional killer and she was murdered by her boyfriend. (slow music) - Leonard. - The guy you showed me in the picture. Yeah. - But how do you know? - I lied to you when I said that I broke my arm rollerskating. Jordan broke my arm. - You need to do something about that bitch before she kills you. (slow music) You know, the Lord only helps those who help themselves. (slow music) - Then pray for me. (slow music) (door banging) (car engine roaring) (door banging) - Whoa. What's going on here? - You killed my sister. - Lady, I don't even know you. - Sydney loved you and you killed her. - Frankie. Sydney's Frankie? - Amazing what a 38 can do for your memory. - Look, look, look, look. Slow your roll, sister, aiit? You don't wanna do nothing crazy. - I wanna know how you can do what you did to Sydney. - Frankie, think this through. Okay? It's not worth it. You and your sister, you had nothing. She didn't like you. You didn't like her. You should hear some of the things she said about you. - What type of shit? - Like you couldn't hold a job. Like she always had to pay your rent. You got knocked up, didn't even know who the father was. Always begging her for money. And you know something? She had the money. But she didn't give a shit about you. (gun blasting) Fucking bitch! (gun blasting) I did you a fucking favor! You inherited what, two, $300,000? And you wanna come in here and do this shit? - When your sister's killed, you're supposed to do something. It doesn't matter if you didn't like each other. But you're supposed to do something because you're sisters. - I can I have another foot of road, bitch. (gun blasting) - So what's up with your bag out there? I have to lend that to Frankie. She's going on another trip. (bullets clattering) - We need to talk, but I gotta unwind first.
