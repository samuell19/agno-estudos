BLOOD FOR DRACULA This is too much. now she will have to stay in the crypt. Help her to sit down. And you yourself have only a few weeks left. Count, you must leave Romania and travel far away. Maybe to England, maybe to France. I think to Italy. Why Italy? There are many reasons. Italians will be impressed by your title and you will find virgins. - Virgins? - Yes. Because of the Italian Church. They need virgins for their marriages. How can I go to Italy? I hardly can move around my own rooms. You can. We have a car, and I bought you a wheelchair. So it's very easy for you to travel around, Count. But I can't leave my family down in the crypt. You must. You must have the blood of a virgin, or you will die in a few weeks. You and your sister are too well known here in Romania. Perhaps you're right. Of course I am. I suppose we have to pack. but I don't know where to start. I've been expecting this for some time. I've been making plans. The only thing to do left is to pack your personal belongings. I jsut wish to take some books, my dried flowers, a few birds. No flowers no birds. They fall apart in the car. They aren't meant to leave the house. Neither am I. I take care of you. Not the birds. Does the heater work in the car? Yes. If you really were clever, Anton, you would bring me a virgin from Italy, and I would not have to go. You know that it's impossible. No good family would give their daughter to me. I can find a girl for you on the streets, but certainly she would not be a virgin. I suppose you're right. I should show up in person. My bed. It doesn't fit into the car. It will ride on the top. That will look suspicious. We will tell the people that it is the body of a relative returning to it's ancestral home. And my clothes? They are well enough to walk around the house, but wouldn't they look peculiar to people? I thought about it. Maybe they are a little bit out of fashion, but it suits you. In besides, people will be impressed, being Romanian. And you, my sister, what will you do? It's better you have the virgin. Then I must go to Italy. But I am the first one in the family who leaves. Take me to the vault, please. So sad. All my relations lying here so peacefully, and I have to go to Italy on this terrible journey. When they were active, they didn't have to leave the castle, so many were so many virgins around. The woods were full of them. And for my sister and I, I cann't manage even to find one. I'm go with your blessing. Our family will continue. Oh Esmeralda, these gardens used to be so beautiful long ago. You see where are the girls are working over there? The gardeners used to plant different things in those beds every season. I used to have daffodils and iris, And in summer I had a garden planted just for scent alone. I'm sure it'll be beautiful again, some day. It's another hot day today! At least we should be more comfortable. Zaffiria! How can you be so vulgar? And besides Momma will see you. Shut up you little baby. We are workers and peasants, and we may as well start acting the part. My! Aren't we developing! Stop! Stop! Stop! Rubinia, Zaffiria! Stop that at once! Put your clothes back on. Troublemaker! Behave yourselves. Your mother's watching you. ' don't care? Am I gonna see you two later? Don't count on it. Cover yourself up. May I help you? We want a room for tonight. Well you must speak with the owner. Two gentlemen for you madam. I like a room for myself and Count Dracula for tonight. Well, I have a room, but it is not ready yet. We can wait. Dracula? What kind of name is that? A Romanian name. And a noble one. Romanians, We haven't had any of those here before. We made a long journey to find a wife for the Count. A wife? He doesn't look up to it. He does look too thin. Does he want something to eat? What do you have? Salami, cold meat. No thank you. Just hot water for tea, later in the room. He looks very sick to me. I hope nothing is going to hapen to him here. They have a room, but it's not ready yet. But they don't have the food I eat. They only have chicken, or vegetables I have never seen before. I am sure they have no virgin meat. We will prepare you a salad later, in your room. I will speak to them, to find out who lives around here. May I? Please. Do you know anyone around here? Frankly no. You see, we made the decision to come here in some haste. A death in the family made the trip necessary. We've been to a number of country places, we've been avoiding the cities because of the corruption there. But is it an Italian wife he wants? His first wife was Romanian. He loved her very much. And when she died he wouldn't look at another girl for years. But he has to marry again. So he wants to find another type of woman, who won't remind him to his first love. Well My God, but there are so many beautiful girls around over here. I don't deny it, but you see the beauty of the Romanian girls is matched by their purity. And the Count's family traditions requires that he marry a virgin. that's why we came to Italy. Because we know that the Italian people are very religious, and keep their daughters virgins. We know so many nice families around. Why don't we introduce him to the Di Fiore family for example? Their girls are so beautiful. Not the oldest one. She never got married. She's a real tramp. How can you ever say so? She was all prepared to go to the convent. And she had all her dresses ready to join the Ursuline order. Are they religous? Oh I am sure they are religious, they have a very nice house. I see your rooms are ready. Can you imagine, if one of these girls ever married a Count from Romania? This room is terrible. And it's full of light. We must get the coffin tonight. No, not yet, we aren't long here. Wait one more day, things look promising. Oh, you think so? I have no coffin to sleep in, the kitchen is full with impure meat. We have been traveling for days, no progress. If they do have virgins around here, they are certainly not for us. Do you think this family around here would leave their daughter out of there sight for one second? It is an impossible situation. But, Count, you heard them talking about this Di Fiore family that has four daughters. It is unbelievable good luck to get this information. What good will it do to us? The people in this country are so suspicious of foreigners. They wouldn't even talk to us for one moment. Why did you take me on this hopeless journey? Let me go home and die in peace. What's good is it to have tea if I can't find the right vegetables to go with it? I guess I have to eat the rest of the Romanian lettuce with lemon. Oil! They put so much oil here on everything! But there must be some cheese. You ate it last night. Grapes? There are gone too. I know it's difficult for you, but don't be discouraged. I go immediately to this Di Fiore estate and pave the way for your arrival. With four unmarried daughters to support, they will be verry happy to hear of an interested suitor. They will be impressed by your title. Stay here and rest Have Faith. I'll return with an invitation to better quarters. Yes, yes Anton. Go ahead but quickly. Don't forget to mention about my special diet. I take care of all details, Count. Please. Let me out tonight. you must. No. no. not tonight. Wait. Buon giorno, Richard. Good morning. Do know that man Gian, who runs the hotel in town? I just had a very strange telephone call from him. He rang about the secretary of a Count, a European Count, who's staying there, He don't know what country he's from. He travels all over the italian countryside looking for a wife for this Count. He mentioned us to him because of the girls. Esmeralda, I don't think we'll ever get her married off. But Zaffiria. Zaffiria is the right age. She should get married, don't you think? My dear, we aren't in the middle Ages. We can't force it. We must be civilized in these matters. When the right moment comes, everything will work out. "everything will work out", that's so like you. You always say "everything will work out". The girls know they don't have to do anything they don't want to do. I do everything, I do the cleaning, I do the cooking ... I have no other servents left except for that handyman. We must do something to bring new money into the family. To save our home. It breaks my heart to see the walls peeling, dust everywhere, the furniture so shabby. This Count may be the most important thing that's happened to us in years. We must make girls understand how important a marriage like this could be to us. Why should we do that? Flowers that are too cultivated they lose some of their perfume, they wither away quickly. In this house, one can say the most intelligent, the most poetic things and nobody takes any notice. I'd rather be far more appreciated. I think I'll go very soon. This is the Di Fiore house? I would like to speak to the Marquis, or the Marquise. Dear, this is Anton Guinegg. This is my husband, the Marquis Di Fiore. I am very honored to meet you sir. I can only be blunt. Since the Count is pressed by family matters, and has only a short time left in this country. His family is very rich, they own thousands of acres, have many workers, 4 castles ... But let's come to the point. The Count is looking for a wife, an Italian wife, and he wishes to know if your daughters are virgins, and available for marriage. Because he heard that your daughters are very, very beautiful. Yes, they are very beautiful but they are still children. My grandmother had a cousin. that married too young and all of the children have bad compexions. I don't know what to say. We're flattered and honoured that you pay us such a compliment. Our daughters are of marriagable age it's true. They'd be happy to meet the Count. Where is he staying? He's at the inn in town. His name is Dracula. Dracula, did you say? Dracula. The sound is so intriguing. Three syllables. Dra-cu-la I like that name. Well, it seems silly for them to stay at the inn, when we have so much room here. I'll have rooms prepared for you and expect you both tomorrow. thank you. It is very kind of you, madame. But one more favour: can you have a special vegetarian diet prepared for him? No trouble at all. The Count is traveling with a coffin, It contains the body of an uncle, who recently died in Rome. And who he wanted to take home to his family vault. So don't be surprised when you see it. Excuse me madam. Would you object if I were to sit at your table and maybe offer you a drink? I am a stranger in town, just passing through and lonely for company. Why no, please sit down. Thank you. may i offer you some champagne? Champagne? Oh no no, just wine. Waitress! Yes sir. - Some more wine. - Yes sir. What a lovely child you have. Is it your daughter? Yes she is. We just stopped in for a quick one on our way home from the fields. I see. Do you happen to know by any chance the Di Fiore family? The Di Fiore family? Yes I think I do. Can you tell me something about them? What is it that you want to know? Why do you ask? You know them? We all used to carry their manure for 4 seasons. They still didn't pay us. So, maybe you can help me? So, maybe you can buty us some wine? I'd be delighted. Sit down. Waitress! Where is she? Thank you. A little friendly came of cards? I don't play cards. Dice? You don't want to play? I would like to play with you, but I don't know any games. "You can do what I do," you know this game? No I don't. Well. I play with Pino. You watch. Okay? Look. Ready? You see? I won. It's ridiculous. Every child can play this game. Well we play. Alright. - Ready? - Yes. Let's go. Cheater! Cheater! The little girl! We got him inside. She is bleeding! She is bleeding! How can you leave me alone for so long in this condition? Where have you been? I have splendid news for you. The Di Fiore family invited us to stay at their house, Especially to meet their daughters We go there tomorrow. I don't even have the strength to make myself presentable. You have seen whats happened to me before. Look at this. An extraordinary thing occurred. I was at the tavern, to get some information about the Di Fiore family, when someone came in shouting that a girl had been hit by a car, and was bleeding. I had to think quickly. I took bread, and ran out. I made my way to the centre of the crowd, and there in a pool of blood was the mutilated body of a young girl I pretended to faint at the sight of her, fell, falling into the blood. I felt the blood soak the bread. They picked me up, but not before the bread was soaked with her blood. Her age Anton, Her age? She should not have more than twelve or thirteen. Was it good? It works. It works! She was pure. Tomorrow we are going have a visitor, girls. and I hope that you will show him all the courtesy a man like him deserves. Dracula. Count Dracula. I admit it would do very well in our family tree. Your father, my children, can understand the substance by the form, the pulp of the fruit by the peel that covers it. There are wine tasters, and name tasters. Yes, Dracula, just the right amount of orient and occident. Of reality and fantasy. If I was not too afraid of making literature or rhetoric out of it, I might add that it has borrowed some ingredient of the Count of Montecristo, or even Sinbad the sailor. To be kept preferably in the horizontal position, away from the light, like great wine. I can already imagine it, just his name. A gentleman, as you might say, aged in wood of the best wood. Now I tell you about his culture. Oh let's get to the point dear! The representative of Count Dracula of Romania has come here with a letter of intention. He intends to select one of you for his bride. He's arrives tomorrow, and will stay with us. You mean, One of us will have to go to Romania with him? Well yes I hope so. How old is he mama? It would have been in poor taste to inquire. Of course. I think you, Zaffiria, that he will seek you out the first. But one can never fortell the vagaries of the human heart. So I want you all to be at your most charming in case he chooses one over the others. You owe it to yourselves and to the entire family for this opportunity. I wonder, those Romanians, look like these gypsies who came around last spring? They were so crude. But those were Yugoslavians. Besides you don't expect gypsies to be refined do you. Although some could be very well trained. Assuming they are dark as a rule, and are quite tall. If he is not fat and greasy, there is a chance he may be quite suitable for one of you. Of course he must be rather odd if he goes around wife-hunting in a foreign country. Well, that servant of his looks like a creep. I saw him leaving the house. I don't want to go away without Rubinia. She'll have to stay with me always. Won't you? Nada. I'm getting out of this dump before the ceiling falls in. I'm going to get myself a Prince. And you, you can have all the Counts of Romania. If he was very ugly what would you do? Then I would run away with Rubinia, and you can have him. Let's go to bed. I don't care anymore what did he look like. Don't you think we should tell him that Count Dracula did you come to marry me? oh yes, the one that is going to make us rich again? That's right. We will have enough money, and be giving parties and shopping in Paris. I decided to take Rubinia with me. But don't worry about not seeing us, because here is what we have planned for you. A nice job like a butler, at the palazzo Dracula. I don't need a job as a butler. 'cause pretty soon, there won't be any butlers. But, of course, oafternce I get married, it will be a strictly master-servant relationship. I want that understood. This is your last chance to be the boss. Or do you start practicing to be a slave? Would you like that? So he's an aristocrat. Is he broke too? I'm sure he's not. Mother wouldn't let anyone in here without checking his background. Your mother has some high-falutin' ideas. for a woman who's got a crack-pot for a husband. and a house that's falling down All you got, it's a title to put in front of your name. And some day that's not going to count either. You're going to be on the bottom. It's going to be just like Russia. Russia? Don't know what's happened in Russia, you dope? Why should she know? They had the revolution there, that's all. They killed all the rich people. Took everything they had, and then killed them. You won't even have this crummy house when it happens here. In the meantime, my dear, you're living on our land. I'm tired of you two tramps. What about your sister? What does she do all night? I'd like to rape the hell out of her. She is only 14! You haven't gat a chance with that one. She's a goody-goody, just like Esmeralda. I'd treat her real sweet, she'd like that I bet. May I introduce: Count Dracula. i can't tell you how delighted I am to be a guest in your villa. A perfect German-Italian architecture. My home is your home. That's very kind of you. I have heard fine things about your family, and your daughters. i understand they have been raised according to the Holy Mother Church. Unusual to find a religious family this day and age. Religion is very important to the girls. We have our private chapel you know. But let me introduce you to them: Esmeralda, our eldest, Rubinia, Perla, the youngest, and i especially want you to meet Zaffiria. Your secretary tells me you have a special diet. That's right, but I don't want to bother you with that matter. it's no trouble at all; cooking is one of my hobbies. In fact, when he gives me the special details, I shall prepare all your food myself. I will not allow anyone else in the kitchen while you are staying here. How considerate of you. But if you would please excuse now, I must go straight to my room. I don't feel very well. Our man Belato will take the bags off the car and carry them up to your room. And the coffin? Of course. How am I supposed to move a coffin? Get somebody to help you. Your count is very different from Mario. Is he your type? I don't know if I could handle him. I love to know what he's like. Maybe he's better than Mario, but then again maybe not. Anyway, he is very formal. I don't think I like him. He could be 20 or 40, you don't know. i think it's terrible that Mum and Father think we should marry him just because of his money. What do you mean "we"? That's your problem. You have to see him first. I didn't find him unattractive but then I never want to marry until I have found out what he is like in bed. That's for sure. That's not a bad idea. It may turn out to be nothing, but anyway, I think I like Mario. Where do you want these things? Just leave them here. But we'd like the coffin brought up to the room immediately. First of all, you're going to have to help me lift the damned thing. And second, It goes in the chapel where Ms. Di Fiore says it goes. You want to stink up the whole house? Well then...Please, Can we have the wheelchair brought? After you help me with the coffin. Are you our servant for our stay, or not? I'm no-ones servant. I'm a worker here. Oh, excuse me please, I misunderstood. My vocabulary is not large. I thought that worker and servant are the same. Just don't make that mistake again. I see, well, what do guests usually do if need something taken care of? I don't know. They haven't had any guests here in so long. You have to get one of the girls to do it for you. I try to arrange that. I don't want to get my white dress dirty. He's horrible. He's really horrible. He is so white, and thin, and weird looking. He is so ugly! Of course he's ugly. You'll have to have babies for him and they'll be ugly too. For the rest of your life you'll be with ugly people, you might as well get used to it. Don't say that. I am so miserable. What are you telling me you're miserable for? You deserve what you're getting. Right now he's a disgusting person with money. After the revolution, he'll be a disgusting person with no money. You are right. Not like you. What will I do? Don't ask me? Maybe you can teach him this. Stop It! Stop It! Stop it! What do you mean, "stop it", Huh. You're hurting me! Stop It! Slut! I'm not good enough? Stop it You're hurting me! I will not hurt you. Please, stop! I love you, Mario. I'm tired of you, you bitch! I won't ever leave you. I know you girls think you're so frightfully modern. Count Dracula may not seem like the ideal husband, but he comes from a very good family. You just have to learn a little give and take. Of course, he is deadly pale, but then he's a vegetarian and they all seem to look like that. Which reminds me, I've prepared his special diet And I want you, Zaffiria, to take it up to him later. But the Count looks sick. What does he think he will do with a wife? His poor health may be a blessing in disguise. I don't understand why you want me to go away with him. We just don't know what kind of man he is. Something bad could happen to me. He could take me away, and beat me or something. Why don't you play your cards right. He seems to like this house. He might even take an interest in it. It must be tonight. The girls are beautiful. They look so pure. But how can we get at them? We'll wait until everyone is asleep. and then, we will try to find their bedrooms. but it's difficult because the villa is so large. And it's a risk, because if someone sees us, it looks suspicious. But we too close now to worry about appearances. We must move quickly, we must try and get as much as we can, before their parents realize what's happening. Anton, see who is that. Come in. I've brought you something to eat. Anton, I wish to talk to this young lady. Leave us alone. You are, I believe, Zaffiria. That's it. What are you got there? Tomatoes, and carrots. It's very thoughtful, very nice. Sit down. You are a very pretty girl. Tell me, How do you feel about marrying me? And coming to live with me? Would you like that? Yes, sure. Well, my family requires that I marry a virgin. I heard that. Are you a virgin? Yes of course. How is it that you never had a boyfriend? It is so unusual to find a girl as developed as you are who has never been with a boy. It is not that unusual. Besides, I am not that developed. Yes, but when you were a little girl, and your body is starting to change, somebody must have put their hands on you. Dis anyone touch you here? Or here? Or here? No, not even the doctor. Not even the doctor? I am going to tell you a secret. I myself don't care if my wife is a virgin or not. You see, I am a very modern man. In front of Anton, I pretend to want only virgin, because he tells everything to my family. I couldn't care if my fiancee is a virgin or not, as long as she is beautiful. And you are very beautiful. So, you can confide in me. You aren't a virgin, are you? I told you I am. I see you aren't from the way you are looking at me. But that's perfect! I want my wife know all the details of love-making. You will have to teach me because I don't know. Come on, I don't have to teach you anything. I'm sorry to put you to so much trouble. but I don't know anything about sex. I wish I did. But I don't. Sorry. You don't know what boys do with little girls? Your sister never told you? They would be too embarrassed. You are a virgin? You're telling me the truth? I believe you. Where's that sister of yours now? Maybe she's seeing the Count. What is she doing with him. staying out this late? It shouldn't take this long to get what he wants from her. It's her responsibility someday to marry someone like him. She's only doing what she's been brought up to do. No point waiting for her. You think he's great, don't you? He isn't rough and clumsy like you. He knows how to treat his woman. All you do is read your stupid manifestos. Who cares about them? You're asking for trouble getting involved with this aristocrat. His days are numbered. I'm telling you for your own good. What do you mean? You sound as if you forget that the Di Fiore are aristocrats? You and your sisters are doing alright working in the fields, helping your mother in the house That's the way it should be. Everybody should do that kind of work. I'm not going to keep on planting vegetables. Somebody has to. And we're not always going to do it for you. The lower classes are born to work, so the upper classes can have a good time. I am an aristocrat, a Countess too. We belong with our own kind. Go find yourself a nice farm-girl who likes to get beat up and shoved around just like a sack of beans? I don't like it anymore. It was just a stage i was going through. I don't see why someone like me tcouldn't marry you, or one of your sisters? Are you crazy? Yes. Your mother'd never hear of such a thing. I had a good lok at him in that wheelchair. Almost about to die. That's the way it is with all that rich trash, they're all sick and rotten. The only future's in socialism. Don't start talking aboput that again. You know how it bores me. You're good only for one thing. Some rich man is going to like me someday, will throw a party for me, will introduce me to the society, to take me shopping on our honeymoon to buy me some beautiful clothes, you will see. What happened last night? I waited up for you How did you get on with the Count? He knows the truth about me. What are you talking about? What does he know? He knows I am not a virgin. Why did you have to say a thing like that? That's no way for a girl to behave. Have you no sense? Did you have to make an entire confession to him? He doesn't want me. You silly girl! You look ill. Go to your room. Your sister's messed everything up. I don't know what the Count will think of this family. The first time he meets one of you girls, look what happens. I hope you will not be so foolish, if you get a chance. But then, of course, he may not want to stay. I don't think she likes him, mother. He is a bit strange. Don't apologize, Marquise. Your daughter Zaffiria is a very nice girl. There is no need for you to be embarrassed. It happens once in a while in every good family. It's so kind of you to say that. A man in my position is well aware of the dangers of modern life, especially for young girls. Are you preparing this soup for me? Yes, I think you'll like it. I trust there is no garlic in it? Oh no, your secretary warned me about that. It's a traditional Italian dish. In the 17th century, when this house was built, they made all the soup with wild herbs from the garden. You sound as if you would know a lot about this subject. Well I've read most of the old cookbooks in the library. You don't have to be so modest. Esmeralda, you've read them all. It's very useful for a woman to practise home-making. Would you like to have lunch in your room? Yes, I would prefer that. Belato, help him back with his chair. We'll send it up to you. You gonna walk up or do you want me to carry you? I'm perfectly able to walk. I'll manage, if you just can bring my up my chair later. Is the chapel over there? Yeah that's it. I saw your lights on pretty late last night. Maybe you can't sleep? Thinking about your relative lying in there? Oh no, he's dead for quite a while. He must have been very sick, the coffin doesn't weigh much. Well, just remains. How long have you been employed here, may I ask? All my life. My father worked here before. Then you must know this family quite well. I was curious; Do these girls have any suitors, any boyfriends? They must. Nobody comes around here. Their parents only want them to get involved with ceertain types, I guess. That's understandable. They're looking out for their best interests. You think so? I don't. I think they're just spoiling things for them. How are you feeling today, Count? Well, thank you. Studying for school? No, it's a new novel, called "Three Weeks," a American lady wrote it. It's so exciting. I'm not familiar with it. I haven't read any recent books. When I'll be finished with it soon, I'll lend it to you. That's very kind of you. Oh no, anytime. Thank you. Surely a girl like that shouldn't marry beneath her class. People don't recognize that classe stuff anymore. It's a thing of the past. You sound very sure of that. I am. I read books, too. Not novels. I know the kind you're talking about. This seems to make you very bitter. Because I know how should that be? So, you dreaming about a change in the order of things? No, not dreaming; waiting. I have heard that before. He is not so bad. In a way he's very attractive. That's not what I heard. So Zaffiria didn't like him. For me, do not necessarily prefer the man with muscles. He looks very sensitive. It may be a nice change from you. So why didn't he like your sister? I thought it was all arranged. I don't know really. There must have been a mistake or a misunderstanding. Must have been more than that. He was about to marry her, now he's not. Well, if you must know, this man is obsessed with marrying a virgin. Oh, well, you didn't tell me this. So what's he doing with you two whores? My sister and I, may go slumming once in a while, but that doesn't make us whores. but how did he find out? I don't know. She won't talk to anyone. I think he upset her very much. But how could he find out he wasn't the first, without her not going to bed with him already? Well what if she did? Is not so awful. It's tough enough looking for a virgin these day anyway. Who does he think he is? Poor Zaffiria! I worry about her. Don't worry about her. You watch. She'll come crawling right back to me. Just watch. You pig! You bitch! Get down there. Being rich doesn't just mean you have money. it means you have time to learn about things that really please a women. I am looking forward to meeting this Count. In fact, I'm going up to see him right now. After I washed this stinking smell. You can't imagine what a man can do to a woman. I hope you never go with this peasant Mario. But I know you see him all the time already. Don't say things like that. Why not? You're old enough. You have to learn about that sometime. The trouble is, you can't fall in love with the first one, or with the one who's good in bed. This is what happened with Zaffiria. She can't get to love with the Count because she likes Mario. But she can't marry him and live in a shack. You aren't supposed to have boyfriends and the husband. It isn't right. As long as you clean and wash yourself up after each one, it's OK. You just have to smell fresh. But you could get a disease. Or something like that. You'll end up just like Esmeralda, if you think like that. It's a new age now. Don't you read the magazines? Oh yes, I want to know all about your home. i heard gypsies are a problem there? I never allow any on my properties. In Romania, it is a custom to have a virgin bride. Their husbands treat them like saints. Why should they treat woman like a saint? Not just a woman; a virgin bride. I'm not sure that I know what you mean. My first wife was an angel. Each morning, I went to her door and knocked. She had her own bedroom? Of course, with her maids. Did your wife ever have any children? No. She was too delicate. I wouldn't put that burden on her. But then, she must have had beautiful clothes. Where did she shop? She didn't like to shop. She liked to read. Your sister was very beautiful. But I see you now, how beautiful you are, and finding we like the same thing, I wish you would have come to me first. What happened between you and Zaffiria? Your sister has ... boyfriend. Really? Did she say who he was? No, she didn't, but I don't care who he was. What about you, you ever went with a man? You had a fiance? I haven't. But nobody cares about those kind of thing anymore. In my country, people do care. You seem so sensitive. You must learn to have fun sometimes? Don't you ever give parties? Your sister did lie to me, but I found out the truth. Tell me! Are you a virgin? Yes, I read all this, but I am a virgin. Tell me the truth. But it is the truth. You have no reflection! My body can't take this treatment anymore. The blood of this whore is killing me. I just want ... my coffin back. To sleep in. I'm rather worried about Rubinia. I tried to talk with her this morning, she looked at me a strange way. However, I have among other things confirmed my deep conviction that everything will end for the best. Dracula gives us the guarantee. Even from an ontological point of view, up to today there is no indication that names ending in "ula" show any negative signs. I hope the poor girl won't take it too badly. Why should she take it so hard? He's a very sick man, he can't last much longer. And when he dies, his widow will be quite a rich woman. The other night, I was going past his room, and I heard him vomiting, poor creature. He could hardly get out of bed. Why he would want to get married, God knows, but since he does If we can't get one of our girls married under these conditions then we never will. I wish my affairs did not require my presence in London at this moment. I'm sorry I have to leave you to cope this sort of problem by yourself. But I be away only three days at the most. Don't worry, my dear. I didn't want to tell you, but I'm getting the analysis of Count Dracula origins made by Professor Bellson. The result will be positive. I am sure. More than positive. Goodbye My dear. This is one of the last of your dresses. They'll all be gone soon; Completely worn out. Excuse me madam. May I have a moment of your time please? Sit down. Count Dracula thanks you for the hospitality you have shown him, but regretfully he must return to Romania. You mean because of Zaffiria? But I thought he would stay and meet Rubinia. It seems that they have met. And that neither of your marriagable daughters are virgins. I'm sure the Count knows you offered them in good faith. Your father will be so disappointed. I wish things had worked out better. It's seems such a shame that Perla has to find out these things so young. And within her own family. How old are you, little girl? She is 14, and much too young to entertain prospects of marriage. Unfortunately. Yes, much too young. But she is very pretty. I'm sure that someday day, she'll make someone a fine bride. You're a good girl, aren't you? Excuse me, but I have to pack for an early departure tomorrow morning. What can I do for you? Momma wants me to tell you to pack the Counts bags on his car tonight. He will be leaving early tomorrow morning. Yeah. Any of your sisters going with him? No. I'm afraid not. That's too bad. Where are they now? They don't come out of their rooms anymore. Maybe they're upset by what's happened. That's hard to believe. They're probably glad to get rid of him. They look like they're sick. There's something slimy about that Count. I don't think he ever wanted to marry any of them. Then, he was interested in something. Why else would he come? He seems to unhealthy to go traveling around the country looking for a wife, dragging that coffin along. You know he wanted that thing in his room with him? It's kind of peculiar isn't it? The coffin was very light, Like there was hardly anything in it. It's strange. They haven't both been to bed with him, have they? What do you mean by that? Don't act innocent with me. You know what I'm talking about. No what? How come I never see you down by my cottage? I have no reason to go there. There are a lot of things down there for you to do. I saw a lot of nice furniture around the house, but all broken. How sad. Especially when it happens, over the years. You sound as if they won't be replaced? I don't think it's possible. You must like this house, don't you? It's run-down now. I notice there aren't any servants around. We don't have any. As I suppose you have guessed, the family is rather hard up for money. I don't want to embarrass you. I'm not embarrassed. You're the first visitor we've had in years. You can't be expected not to have noticed that most of the furniture here is wicker from the garden. But how did conditions here get so desperate? Father gambled all the money away in London. And when the cash was finished, he put up the furniture as collatoral, and also lost most of that too. What stopped him form losing the hous itself, I don't know. And now he's in London again. This state of affairs seems to trouble only you. Your sisters are more light-hearted it seems. They think I'm strange. They always laugh at me, actually. But if I don't care, after father and mother are gone, the family traditions will be finished. I am the last one in my family line also. No brothers and sisters? None living. How come that an intelligent girl like you are is not married? Once I was engaged. It lasted 17 months, then it didn't work out. I see. You've been engaged. And now my parents think I'm not suitable for marriage anymore. I'm must return tomorrow to my country. Maybe in different circumstances, we might have gotten to know each other better. Are you alone? Where is Esmeralda? She must be with with mother. What do you want? What are those marks? The kiss of Count Dracula. Look. Is she? She is. You must come with us, to the Count. Why? Why? I don't want. I don't want to. Perla, please, come on. My sisters are in trouble. Something strange has happened to them. They won't talk. They have marks on them. Their necks have been bitten. I'm so scared. They just came after me. You should have known that before. A creep from Romania looking for virgins. That Count who was going to do so much for your family is a vampire. What does that mean? It's a throwback to religous perverts in the Middle Ages. He needs to suck a virgin's blood to stay alive. And your mother was so stupid and money crazy she set you all up for him. Why did he do that to Zaffiria and Rubinia? They are not virgins. That's right. So the bites didn't make them vampires. But they're probably under his control. You're the one he wants now, no wonder they went after you. You lose that, uh, virginity of yours, before he catches you. You don't mean ... Why not? My God! You are just an employee. How dare you put my daughter in such an unfortunate position? Shut the hell up. You don't know what you are talking about. It's nothing to get so upset compared to what's going on right under your nose. It's better I'm doing it to her than her sisters do it, or that she gets sucked sucked by that vampire. What vampire? Where are those two tramp sisters of hers? I can show you what the Count's done to them. be quiet. He's an important man. Now I realize that it's all your fault that we're in so much trouble. Just show me where they are. You'll see. What happened when you went to see the Count? He was much better than you. I'm sure. Look at her! And her! Why were you taking your sister there? He told us to. Why would he do that? You mean you still don't understand? You sending them up to meet a vampire. What? The Count's a vampire. So, forget about a wedding, and start thinking about how we're going to kill him. Kill him? Where is he now? In his room I think. Esmeralda, come here. Where've you been? Terrible things are happening here. I don't feel well. You're the one in real trouble. You are a virgin, as far as I know. If he gets to you, you'll be a full vampire. I'm going to get an ax. You stay away from him and that servant of his. If he gets away, these two will stay like this forever. I'll do what you say. Don't shoot. Let me out. I will tell you everything about your daughters, and how you can stop Count Dracula. You betrayed my entire family and now you turn on your own kind. You can not hurt me, you fool. I am not one of you. No! Leave him alone! He belongs to me! Get away from him. Don't you know what he is? He's a lonely soul! I will take him away. We will die together! You're crazy. He lives off other people. He's no good to anybody and he never was.
