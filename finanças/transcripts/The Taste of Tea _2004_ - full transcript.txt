The girl he had a crush on moved away. Hajime Haruno regretted never having told her, nor talked to her. Not that it was going to make any difference, as he knew he never had the guts to confess anyway. And all this self criticism made him... ...regret even more. THE TASTE OF TEA Sachiko! What? The tea's getting cold! Or... it could be... Like this. Like this. Yeah, the hands... Like this... And... That could work. The hand and... I like it. Remember that pose, okay? I'll go get the camcorder. Okay? Just a sec. Go. It's a bit... ...different than before... It was like this, and then you went... You know, I'm thinking... This pose? I think I'll go with this. That? Isn't this better? Early July, I make my way into a field of blooming sunflowers, Facing the golden sunlight as they set my heart on fire. Are your eyes ablaze? Are your ears ablaze? Is your soul ablaze? It recalls the words of Buddha in the primordial Sutta Nipata scriptures. For a long time, nothing burnt me. I spoke to no one, answered to no one. Being a daughter, a mother, a wife, and a human being kept me busy, made me forget. The color of the burning sky, the smell of the warm earth. Who is that calls? Why am I not running, now that I've been released in the field? Right, then. Another poetry recital from the vice principal. Now, Murakami, anything on behalf of the student council? Yes. Um, this is what we decided at our last meeting. 1. Don't pick fights with Yamaguchi. 2. Don't throw stones at his house. Sachiko Haruno was wondering. When on earth was that giant version of her going to disappear? And whenever she wondered, there was a story she always remembered, as she was doing now, a story told by her uncle. You know that pond you often go to? That area used to be a forest. Folks here called it the haunted forest. And so, well... ...dunno, maybe kids these days don't believe in haunted forests, but... I guess... You guess...? Anyway, er... Oh, yeah. So I was in 6th grade... No, in 5th... about 5th grade. In the haunted forest? Right, where I took a shit outdoors for the very first time. Shit outdoors? Yep. For some reason, there were lots of wild chickens out there, maybe they flew the coop, dunno, but kinda having no money, I used to go there to find eggs, y'know? And on that day of my first outdoor shit, I didn't go to the bathroom all day. Even after school, I was wandering about, looking for a good spot. I ended up going to the forest, but still couldn't decide where to do it. It's surprising how much you struggle in spite of wanting to go for it, y'know? Anyway, I soon came across this egg. It was half buried in the ground, like somebody had tried to hide it. It was weird, but somehow gave me the impetus. And I badly needed to go. So, I did it, right then and there. Because I'd kept it in for so long, it was quite a dump. I felt great afterwards, till I noticed how dark it had gotten. I suddenly felt scared and went home. But on the way back, I started thinking... What the hell was a huge egg like that doing there? And why did someone try to bury it? And on top of that, why did I have to shit on it? Normally I'd have brought it back home, a big egg like that... And thinking like that made me feel really miserable. But I let it pass for the day. After that I kept going back to look for it, but it just... ...disappeared. It's not like I wasn't familiar with the forest, y'know? But I couldn't find it. So I finally gave up looking. And that's when this guy showed up. What guy? A guy covered with tattoos, bleeding. You mean, like a ghost or something? Yeah, maybe. God... He'd be watching me at every turn. It was freaky. He'd be there whenever I let my guard down. Like when? Like when I'd be cleaning up at school... Raking the school yard... cleaning out the chicken coop... You were cleaning 24/7! Shut up! He also appeared when I was studying, right here in this room! And when I visited the shrine... Anyway, he'd show up, no... He'd just be there, watching me. But why was he covered in blood and tattoos? Beats me. Wonder why. Anyway he was all bloody, tattooed... And had shit on his head. Shit?! Yeah. Shit, blood and tattoos... Wait, does that have anything to do with you shitting in the haunted forest? Dunno... probably not. Anyway, so this guy... Hey, it's a pretty good story, right? Yeah, weird... but cool. So he's watching me, till one day, he suddenly disappears. Disappears?! I was working on the horizontal bar. Practicing all day, while he stared on. I'd sorta gotten used to him by then. So I thought what the heck and kept practicing. Then, when I finally got around the bar, he disappeared. Just like that... Sachiko often wondered if the best way to get rid of the big Sachiko was to do a backflip on the horizontal bar. However, something held her back, kept her from practicing. One of the key points being that the man watching her uncle was a total stranger covered in blood, whereas the person watching her, was herself. Perhaps his case wasn't so useful in solving her problem, she'd conclude, every time she remembered his story. Anyway, there actually was another episode even Ayano didn't know about. Something which happened right about the time he managed his first backflip... Boss! Hey. What the hell... Skull fracture? No... See this and this? Guy's been shot. It's a yakuza case? Yes. Shit... Is that like, for calligraphy? Are you kidding? 'Course not! Hey, look at me. Yes. How do I look? Nice. And this? What do you think? Awful. Killed, buried and crapped on. Didn't happen at the same time. How do you know? You have to ask? He didn't die a skeleton, did he? And what of the miraculously fresh shit? Decomposition first, then came the shit. Oh... Better check the shit out as well then. Yes. You do it. Here. Around that time, Ayano did a successful backflip in the schoolyard. And the ghost of the dead yakuza who had been stalking Ayano, was finally set free from the stench and from this earth. In light of how it returned a lost and angry soul of a yakuza to afterlife, one could say, Ayano's shi... ahem, droppings did have certain merits. Wouldn't you agree? I like you. I like you a lot, Hajime. PS. I'll be waiting at Romanchi after school today. Romanchi I felt up Aizawa's breasts! No way! Which hand? Which hand? This hand? You perv! How did she react? She was wearing a bra. And they were firm. Firm! Wait, wait, wait. You're pissing off Matsuken. Apologize, man. Apologize. I'm sorry. But, how did she react? Like, y'know? You lucky bastard! Boing! Aw, I'd kill for that! But who'd you pick as a wife? I'd go for Kazumi Furune from Class B. No way! Kazumi? I like her, too. Huh? Really? Get your own! I've liked her since first year. Me too. She gave me a gift on Valentine's Day. How about you? Me? Linda... In first year? You like 'em young? You watch your mouth! I DO like 'em young! Jailbaits? Uh oh. Entering dangerous territory! Young works for me. I'm all for it if it's Matsuken. Aw, what a loss, man! Here he comes!! Hurry up! Make sure he doesn't see you! Legs out! Head in! You've gotta seduce him! Hey Hajime! Not even listening. Ah, well... It's all your fault. Me? It's yours! You and your ugly legs! Ugly and gross. Excuse me, but I'm the one who had to shave my legs till I was raw. Well, man. I think it looks pretty sexy. Not sexy, but like, nice and smooth! What's nice about 'em, huh? Touch 'em. Feels like sandpaper! What, you like him? Yeah, he does! Not like that. Not like that. I just like smooth legs! End of story. Anyway, we're way off topic. We were talking about Hajime. One month had passed since the girl moved. And he was on the brink of female phobia. There were two reasons for this, Namely 'The Soba Noodle Shop Incident' and 'The Convenience Store Incident'. 'The Soba Noodle Shop Incident'. Set B, please. What's wrong? Huh? What? Nothing. We don't have to, y'know? You're saying that now? We don't need to go. Whatever. What do you mean whatever? Huh? What? What? I'm not forcing you. I'll go! Why? What do you mean? I don't want you to feel pressured. I'm saying I'll go! It'll be over before it starts. Hey... Will you really love me more? I love you just the way you are. So I don't need to go? Give it a rest, okay? Sorry... You said you wanted it too. I wanted to make you happy. I did some research, read up on it. They say it feels totally natural. You mean when men squeeze them. Don't talk like that! No, I mean when women... 'wear' them? All I care about is if you'll love me more and more and more! Don't make light of this. But that's all that's been running through my head! Don't worry. It won't feel strange. It won't?! Of course it'll feel weird! It's fine, apparently. But... You've said you wanted big breasts too. Big tits. Don't you want 'em? Yeah... Let's go. It's time. It'll be fine. Should I call my mom? No, that's not necessary. She might worry. She'll be fine. Maybe you could call her for me? No way! That'd be too weird... Uh uh. Too fucking weird... Here you go. 'The Convenience Store Incident'. Hey, what's up? My girl needed pantyhose. Oh... Hey, did she hit you again? Can you tell? You're black and blue. No bone fractures. That's what you say. And your ribs? They've healed? Still hurts when I breathe. But no sweat, eh? Tough guy. I've gotten used to it. Used to it?! Yeah. Your girlfriend's scary. Oh, she's not... What the... What is it? Look at me, this way. Look over here! It's nothing. C'mon, lemme see... Your nose is crooked. It is not. No, seriously. See, it's crooked. It's not. It's crooked! It's not. It's fuckin' busted!! Yeah, she got me good. And what about her? I mean, does she ever hurt her hands or what? Dunno... she wears leather gloves. Scary! Nah. I'd better get going or she'll be pissed. See ya. Bye. It's my birthday... What to do? My birthday song... What to do? My birthday... Good morning. Morning. Good morning, boss. Sit, boy. You brought Aki? I told you not to. No real dogs. Pets aren't allowed in this building. Hey, are you listening to me? No pets! None whatsoever! So don't bring them! Would you like some tea? Yes... You're just like a triangle. Why, oh, why? Why, oh, why? Why are you a triangle? Why, oh, why? Why, oh, why? Why are you a triangle? Because I am a triangle? Why are you a triangle? Why are you a triangle? To a good game. I'll go first. Here's your tea. I have mine. Really? Then I'll drink it. That was some wind! Err, Miss...? Suzuishi. Oh, yes. Suzuishi. Well, why don't we start over again? Go ahead. Uh... I'm Aoi Suzuishi. Miss Suzuishi? Yeah? 'Yes'. Nothing else you'd like to add, like where you're from? Sorry. I'm Aoi Suzuishi. I previously attended Yoyogi High. 'Aoi' as in 'blue' in kanji? It's actually in katakana. And your favorite color's blue. Moron! You? No, you! Ah, you're beautiful. Cut it out! Um, where should I sit? Kakinuma, you can go home. Phew! Really? Fetch a desk. You could've just said so. Wait till the desk comes. In the meantime, let's start. We're having a popquiz today. Not fair! Consider it last week's review. You have 15 minutes... And just like that, Hajime was in love again. So, it's a school holiday? Nope. Uncle... Yeah? What? What is it? What's wrong? This is stupid... No Trespassing. Shit... Another one! Another one? Here goes. Wow, this guy's amazing! Sonoda! Bro needs ya! Wait a minute. What are you doing? Please? Where did you two go together? Hey, Aoi? Have you decided? Yep. Which club? The 'Go' club. 'Go'? Are you serious? Yep. I like Go. Really? Never played? No. It's kinda fun. Um, could you leave? We're trying to clean up here? Can't you see we're talking? And we're sweeping. So? Leave? Alright. You played Go at your former school? Yeah. I'm not that good though. Go! Hajime! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go Club! Yes! Go! Go Club! Go! Hey. Uncle Ayano! You're full of energy. Wanna play Go? Nah. I'm exhausted! Where's mom? Shopping. With Grandpa. Man, I'm so tired. I rode my bike all the way from school. Oh... I can't breathe! The Go club! Who the hell are you? Stay back baby. Don't worry. Get your hands off my girl! Show me what you've got! Piece of cake. I'm the Go Man! Go Man! Go Man! I'm gonna take the bike to the station. Okay... Hey, you're late. Yeah. School club? Nah, my bike... What about it? I went home on my bike, but decided I'd need it tomorrow morning. So I brought it back. I see. Excuse me, sorry. Let me through. Sorry. So what do you think? Of what? Of this? Good vibe? What vibe? Well, I was wondering... Oops... Be careful. Sorry. C'mon, look at me. I am looking. What is it? Don't I look weird? Out of place? But we had to wear them to carry them, right? I know that, but... We could've taken a cab. Which is what I said. Don't pull! But you'll hit it again. I won't. At least yours isn't as bulky, Rokutaro. Don't call me that. Huh? I'm not Rokutaro when I'm wearing this. You're upset? If anyone, I'm the one who should be upset, period. Period, huh? Anyway, yeah, that is a dickwad outfit. So I do look weird? Me and my costume? Yes. Looks funny? Incredibly. Incredibly? A disgrace to The Meteor Power Force. 'Meteor Power has reached critical point! ' 'That is possible! Totally possible! ' 'What is your opinion? ' Should we do it here? Let's do it! 'And now! Deep within your eyes! ' 'Turn on the Meteor power! ' 'It's already on, sir! ' 'Kids these days... ' 'Call it evolution. ' Your tears are the signal, the signal. The twinkling signal, yes, the signal. Bright sky filled with your soul's energy. Starlight Connection! You want some, shithead? Huh? Are you making fun of me? Sorry! Sorry! Please don't damage it! Yasuda! Let go of me! Home run! Been getting your hands on boss's money, Yasuda? Get in there! That really happened? All true. Pretty scary stuff... Right in front us too. That's way too creepy! Gave me goose bumps! Don't exaggerate. But it's scary, sis! How? Execution! Execution?! You're doing good. Aggressive, aren't we, Hajime? Wanna play? Think you're smart enough? Hurry up. Just a moment... Not bad. For an airhead. Shut up, will you? We're serious. Sorry. Ok, I'm leaving. Right. Bye, then. I'm leaving too. Bye. Mr. Todoroki? I'm off tomorrow. Oh, really? Please don't call my house like you did last time. I told my husband that I'll be working here all night with you. Oh. You know what I mean? Yeah. Don't call me at home tomorrow, like last time. Are you listening? Are you listening to me? Yes. Bye then. Hello? Your wife's having an affair. Who the hell is this? Mountain, oh my moun... Oh, hey... I thought you left... Go out with me! Wait! Wait... ow! Stop it! Stop! Don't hurt me! Don't hurt me! Ow... Stop it! Ow... Why'd you do that for?! Bitch! Haruno... Where's Little? He's um, still in Brazil. Oh... Still working on his art? Yeah, he's been back and forth. Oh, really? Does he have a show? Like now? Yeah, over there... Maybe, that is... Right... How have you been? Me? Okay. I'm still a sound mixer. Oh. So... how's business? You have to ask? Oh, guess that's the way it is. Right... I'll open that for you. Jammed. Happens sometimes. Your hands... Nah, it's ok... I'm just... y'know, really glad... Huh? I mean, you look well and... I'm glad... I... and I'm glad about your marriage too... I'm over you, really... But since I... never made it to your party or to our class reunions... Thought you might've felt awkward... But I guess you didn't... I did worry. Really worried. I called... so many times. Really? Oh... right... But I'm glad too. Huh? You look well, too. Me? Yeah, totally. Good as can be, yeah. Well, um... Congratulations on your marriage. I really mean it, honest. This is embarrassing... Congratulations! Thanks. Sorry, my hands were dirty. Oops! What am I doing? Thanks... I shouldn't keep you from work. No, no, no. So, good luck. Which may not be the appropriate word here, but... Want some tea? No, that's okay. I've gotta... You have to go? Yeah... Nebuta dance! Sumo wrestler! Give them a break, Grandpa. It's the weekend. I love squid! I'm home! She's back. Told you. I'm relieved. Squid. Where's my squid? No squid, Grandpa. She wasn't with Ayano? Dad! Hi. I'm hungry. Coming right up. Where'd you go? Here. Want natto beans? Can you pass it honey? Excuse me. You're distracting me. Why don't you ask him directly? Yeah? You think? Look, I really couldn't say. Ask Ayano directly, okay? I'll have him call you when he gets in. Where did Sachiko go this morning? Dunno. No. He'll do it if you ask properly. Look, I'm busy now... I'll get him to call you. Want to talk to him? No. So, he'll call you. Yes. Bye. Grandpa! What did he want? He wants Ayano to make his CD. His CD? He's a manga artist, not a musician. Well... He's singing? Yes. He also wrote the song. Why is he asking Ayano then? 'Cause he's a pro? That's way too much trouble. And not his style. Well, they did fall out before... Grandpa! See, you're choking! Damn... Leave the tomatoes! Why don't you take a bath? Huh? Hello? It's me. Stop hassling Ayano. None of your business, brother. But I'm serious too. What's wrong with a manga artist making a CD? It's not for sale, just a private thing. A birthday gift for myself. Yeah, yeah, yeah... But that's between Ayano and me. And it's been settled. Financially. With money. It won't cause you any trouble. Eh? I see... Okay... I'll call him directly. Gimme a break and shut the fuck up! What? Are you stupid? Yeah, I'm listening. Hey, don't transfer any money! 'Cause I'm not gonna do it! Mixing your birthday song? Do it yourself, asshole! No, I'm telling you not to... If you transfer it, I'll use it, but I ain't mixing shit for you. Whatever, dickhead! I'm hanging up. I swear to God... I'm deleting this... Um, I can play the keyboards. Good enough for a demo. Really? Yes. Why don't we make the demo first, send it to Ayano, and then ask him if he'll do it? Really? And the chorus? I can sing too. - And dance? - Dance? You're hot water. I know. That birthday song of his... Wonder what it's like... Sachiko? Your feelings, your heart. The comfort you offer. For you are hot water. For you are hot water. Hey, hurry up! Move it! Sorry! You filthy bastards! Don't get dirt on it. We won't. I'm starving. Dumplings at Sudo's, bro? Sudo's? Closed already. The old gal closes up early. Oh... I wouldn't mind Ran Ran's dumplings. Ran Ran, now that's a plan. We haven't eaten there in ages. My treat. Let's go. Oh, Yeah! Don't you dare leave stains! So this is the red elephant, discovered by Poliades the 13th... Look carefully at its tail. At the tip, where it's curled. When an elephant's tail is curled, it suggests that in its next life... Haruno, are you listening? Eyes over here, please. In its next life, it'll become something with natural perm. Okay? The curly tail will be passed on. This'll be in the exam. It's been raining since morning. The baby fox was lazing about. 'Why don't I write a letter? ' But he saw Rabbit and Raccoon yesterday. 'I know! I'll write to Mouse. ' 'I haven't seen her for days. ' She hurt her leg and can't go outside... So I'm lying there and suddenly... Like this. See the difference? He's amazing. That's beautiful. A true master. Please eat, eat. Go ahead. Thank you. Nobuo? You know this is my last night. Will you do that for me? Sure. Great! That? That. What's 'that'? Inhale... Together with me... Exhale... Inhale... Exhale... Now... Look at this... Stare at the light... Stare... Concentrate... You're blinking more than usual... And your eyelids are becoming heavier, but that's fine... Becoming heavier... And heavier... And finally they become so heavy, they close, and stay that way... You've now reached a very deep place. It feels very good there. A place that belongs to you alone, where nobody can bother you. You can only hear the sound of my voice. You'll be able to hear nothing else. I will now remain silent for a while... 'The Jungle girl who shocked the nation! ' 'Discovered in the wild 13 years ago! ' 'Brace yourselves, 'cos she's back! ' 'As a comedian! '. Enjoy. You can turn it up now. You sure? They can only recognize my normal voice. Who is this? Jungle girl turned comedian. Hello, we're Tokyo Dombi Combi! Look at her, everyone! She used to live in the jungle! Unbelievable, right? I mean, she looks just like the girl next door. I used to be like a saber toothed tiger! Wrong cue, partner. Well, at least you can tell this is really a live show! So, um, as to why I decided to team up with her... A saber toothed tiger! So, um... 'Please Wait a Moment... ' I totally experienced a new world. A new world? Space rushing towards me like crazy, blinding my vision... And I was mixing... I might be the real deal! You already are. The real... Shit, Nobuo! I feel embarrassed! Well, mine had some cool moves. Your tea. It was like a 3 D burst of colors, right from here! I know! It felt great! Then what happens? Then... I become a part of it, and nothing matters anymore... It's not about what happens next. Why? Well, it's somehow liberating to assimilate with that world. Probably because it belongs to my subconscious... I think... Why? It might be hard for you to understand, because it's my world. Even I don't get it. Just like so many other things in this world, yes? Do you know what I mean? Please give it back. What? Isn't this it? Give it back! These please. Hey, Uchi. Check this out. Look. A book on Go. This one too. Bingo! Jackpot! Um, what is it? You're in first year? Yes. You like Go? Join our Go club. I'm the president, and he's... The vice president. But I... You're not a member of The Nihon Ki in? No. Are you in cram school? No... Any extra curricular activities? No... Then join us. Which class? Class 3. Same as Aoi. Yes! All set then. See you after school. But... Be there! Hello. Hey! Hello. We met him in the library. I like these poses, they're good. You don't see stuff like this nowadays. I like it a lot. But something's not quite right yet... No, really. Like this one? It's good. This is the way it should be. Oh, yes. But this one's awesome too. But it has to be like this, you see. Not this? This, this, then this. This, then this... I wanted to make it a bit more masculine... And Grandpa won't look at them? Not recently, no. Even today, he went out to see my brother in law. And he knew you were coming... Ah, but that sounds like him. Does it? Your brother in law is Ikki Todoroki, right? Yeah, the manga artist. I'm a fan. Last thing he'd went to hear. He's a bit weird, just like Grandpa. Really? Hey, you're in the frame. Sorry. Ready? Looks good. Realistic. Again. Here? How's this? Nice! Good? Looks totally real. Hey, what happened little girl? That area's off limits. What's the matter? Mud man. Mud man?! You beat me. You're good. Where did I go wrong? With this move? Thought so. Another game? Sure. I have to go home. Bye! Take care. I should've moved this... Hajime? I'm alive! Here, use this. Thanks. Thank you. You can keep it. Sorry... Thank you... Thank you... Thank you... I'm so sorry... Don't mention it, Mr. Yasuda. Thank you... Thank you... Then what happened? He ran off, crying. He sure is something! Yeah. If I couldn't eat for three days, I'd die of sheer hunger. That's why you're impressed? What's wrong? Y'know, you're really something too. I agree. Right? Here. I'm home. He's back. We have guests? What a dumb song. Again? Nah, take it out. What was that? My stupid relative made it. Sorry about it. No problem. It's got no vocals yet? No. Damn... Get me the schedule sheet. Back to work? After a break. Yeah? Ayano, why did you become a sound mixer? Well, it's more like, why shouldn't I, y'know? Good enough answer? Yeah. Good. Ayano, the Mixer... And you? How's your wife? My wife? My wife's fine. I haven't seen her recently. Close the door, man. What's Chiba Gas? Chiba Gas? Oh, that's Chiba Gas. Chiba Gas, as in Chiba Gas? It's, y'know... Oh, that one! One half ass job after another. Book that period. And you're assisting, Sabu. Thank you. Right, ready to give it a shot? A shot? A shot, man! Roger! Roger, my ass! And the title? 'Oh, Mountain'. 'Oh, Mountain'? What? 3 Days Later. Moun moun moun Mountain Mountain Mountain. Moun moun moun Mountain Mountain Mountain. Moun moun moun Mountain Mountain Mountain. Moun moun moun Mountain Mountain Mountain. Moun moun moun Mountain Mountain Mountain. Moun moun moun Mountain Mountain Mountain. Mountain! Mountain! Mountain! Mo... un... tain... Oh, my mountain, Oh, my mountain The mountain is alive. Oh, my mountain, Oh, my mountain The mountain is alive. Oh, my mountain, Oh, my mountain The mountain is alive. The mountain is alive The mountain is alive. Oh, my mountain, Oh, my mountain The mountain is alive. Oh, my mountain, Oh, my mountain The mountain is alive. Oh, my mountain, Oh, my mountain The mountain is alive. Oh, my mountain, Oh, my mountain The mountain is alive. The mountain is alive, mountain is alive The mountain is alive. The mountain is alive! Listen to it long enough and your brain will melt. They're like perverted aliens from some unknown world... Hey, wanna trust me with this track? It's platinum disc material... You're nuts. There's a white wall. A white wall... Observe it and give me more details. It goes on, forever and ever. It's tall and in front of me, on my sides, behind me, extending into infinity. And you... where are you in this white world of yours? I'm floating in the air... Wearing this white bodysuit thingy... something sort of fitted... thin and translucent over my whole body... with something cute and fluffy, like bunny ears on my head. And I'm floating in the air. That sounds nice... Very, very nice... Where's dad? At my brother's again? He's in his room, working. Working? On what? We aren't to look. And that stupid song? Is that finished? Ayano sent us a copy of the CD. Complete with a bonus video. Is it any good? Gave me a headache. Did you watch it? I liked it. I'll listen to it when I have time. But given the choice... Exactly. I kinda liked it. What about it? It's more cool than weird, and it stays in your head. It was sorta cool. Seriously? What is it? What? Oh, c'mon... What is it? Grandpa? Hey, wait! We've gotta go. Already? Yeah, it's starting. A bit more? Tanaka's turned green. Green! Just remember it! Sorry. Rain check? Sorry! Sorry! Green? Green! Didn't he say purple? They left. Maybe I should go too. Haruno? Yes? A game? Five handicap? Sure. To a good game. To a good game. Um... I... It was my dream to play Go with you like this. Then let's play everyday. I'd like that. Thanks. Hajime? Hajime! Dad! Good day? How long have you been there? Not telling. Will you pay attention? It goes in here. Not there. Sorry. And close this. Hi everyone. The director has arrived. Sorry I'm late. Ready? In a minute. It's not working well. Last of today's dailies! Running time? About two minutes. Wow, that's long! Right then, everybody please take a seat. And close all the curtains please. All of them. Tightly. No lights please. I want pitch black. Everybody ready? Wrong seat, Yoshiko. I'm fine here. These are your drawings. Go upfront! Please... Must listen to the director... This sequence is all yours? Yes. It's Yoshiko's world, full on! I want sound and effects! We'll improvise on the spot! Make it good, guys! I'm psyched! Ready? Yes. Here we go! Lights off! I'm already liking this. Scene 64: Tired... Aw. Aw. That hurt! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Awesome timing! This is great! Oh and here he comes! Man, he's wicked! Gattai King! Super Big! Super Big! Take this! Take this! God, they're SMALL!! Tiny! And flat! And it's Marimari! That was fantastic! Lights on! Welcome back! Thank you. What did you think? Absolutely wonderful! Your movements are tops! Thank you so much. I'm relieved! It was a great opportunity you gave me... And with advice from my master/Grandpa, I was able to gradually get back in form. And now I feel like I could have a family and also be an animator. I did it! And it was a lot of fun! Drawing's where the joy is. Yes, that's what... Anime's about! No doubt about it! Just a moment, please. Hello? Doctor! Wait a sec... Yes? I see an angel. It's telling me I'm okay. That's good. It's a hair dryer. Oh, um, well... I'm going to take this call right now. So you go ahead and have fun with your angel dryer friend, okay? Yes. Hi, sorry. What is it? Is that right? The director too? And another job offer? That's great news! What a comeback!
