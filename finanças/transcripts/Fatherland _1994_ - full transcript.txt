Sync. by Barel It has been 20 years since the second world war ended ... with the failure of the allied invasion of Normandy. A triumphant Hitler declared victory over Europe and the British Empire. The United States withdrew from the conflict ... listening to those like Charles Lindberg ... who had argued against a war with Germany. In the east, only the Russians fought on in a bitter guerrilla war. American efforts turned to retribution for Pearl Harbor. That came in the summer of 1945 with victory over Japan. By then, American General Einsenhower had returned from Europe to the United States ... in a humiliating retirement. In 1947, King Edward and Queen Wallis assumed the British throne. Winston Churchill, who had barely escaped with his life after Normandy ... died in exile in Canada in May, 1953. In the years after the war ... country after country of the old Europe ... had become part of the vast Nazi Empire of Germania. The Führer's architect, Albert Speer, built a monument to the 1000 year Reich. Germania's capital, Berlin, became a Nazi showplace. The SS became a peace-time police force... patrolling clean and orderly streets. As the 50's came to a close... Hitler was able to put a more civilized face on the Greater Reich. But news continued to be tightly controlled. The 60's began with the war with the Soviet Union still dragging on. Hitler desperately needed to conclude a formal peace with the United States and forge an alliance against the Russians ... still led by the 85 year old Joseph Stalin. Hitler saw signs for hope in late 1960... with the election of a new president of the United States. The Führer believed with President Joseph Kennedy Senior in office... at last there was someone with whom a deal could be struck. Now, in 1964, for the first time in 20 years. Germania's borders are opening to the Americans. The world press has been invited to cover the Führer's birthday celebration, on April 20th. There are rumors that President Kennedy will attend... a Germanian-American summit conference. An alliance with America would assure Germania's invulnerability. But there are other, more persistent rumors that could threaten Hitler's plans. There were stories that something terrible happened in Germany during the war. That the official Nazi story, that Jews and other minorities had been relocated to the east ... wasn't true. There are also rumors that in the Greater Reich terrible things are still happening. Televison, radio and newspapers are all controlled by the powerful Ministry of Information. Nobody, in the New Berlin, dares to ask awkward questions. Push. Let's get out of here. Yes, March. - Good morning, March. There's a body in the park, by the lake, about 500 meters from the main road. Meet Eisler there. - It's Sunday, my son's here. I know it's Sunday, but you're on standby and there's no-one else. Alright. ... further North, morale among our forces is high and Eastern Army command is anticipating a complete collapse of remaining Russian military forces within a month. But the big news today is the preparation for the Führer's 75th birthday, in four days time. Papa... Do you think we could visit America soon? Why? Well ... I'd like to spend more time with you, really. I'd like that too. Maybe you should ask your mother when you go home, nicely. I have and she already said yes. Did she? No, but she should have. Come and help me. Thank you. Führer, my Führer bequeathed to me by the Lord... ... protect and preserve me as long as I live. Thou hast rescued Germany... -Pili ... Do you remember you used to say grace... when your mother and I were together? No. Want to try it. Okay? Okay. For what we are about to receive. For what we are about to receive. May the Lord make us truly thankful. May the Lord make us truly thankful. Amen. Amen. Thank you. Heil Hitler. -Heil Hitler. When was the body discovered? - An hour ago, sir. Hermann Jost, an SS cadet from the Sep Dietrich Academy, on his morning run. Here is his statement. -Thank you. Sir. Morning Dr. Eisler. Guten morning, Major. Where's Jäger?... - I wish I knew. A great partnership you fellows have. Enjoying the weather? -It was a lot colder at Stalingrad. Give me a closeup of the face. He obviously wasn't out running. An old amputation. Rather well done! -Very good indeed. I'm very happy for him. Did he drown? -Well, they pulled him out of the lake... but, ask me after the autopsy. Time of death? There's early rigor, but the water is very cold. It's difficult to tell. "Ask me after the autopsy." Where did you find him? In the water... just behind the rock. Nice start .... Sunday. Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler. -Greater Reich Tourism welcomes you to Tempelhof International Airport. I am Helga Schröder, your guide. On behalf of the Ministry of Culture and Education ...

She met my father before the war. ... Maguire I knew a Paul McGuire here...diplomat. -He was my father. You're kidding?

Your key, Miss McGuire. Your'e in room 75. Enjoy your stay in Berlin. -Thanks. I read your works, Mr. Elliot ... but I think, maybe, this will help you be a bit more accurate... Fraulein Maguire? You dropped this, I think. No, I don't think so. I think you did. There was a lot of water in the lungs, which were swollen ... balloon-like... and a watery, foaming fluid came out when pressed. So, he could have drowned. but, he has also suffered a massive coronary. Hard to say which came first. Extensive bruising on the upper part of the body... Bruising? He must have struggled to get out of the water. Probably in the water less than two hours. Thank you. Josef Bühler. Architect of the Jewish re-settlement programme. Admitted to excesses in work camps during the war. In the 1950's ... he... ... introduced... reforms of the camp system. He was a close friend of Hitler in the 1920's. Connections in every department of the Reich. Forced retirement in 1961 ... After allegations of improper use of state property. I remember... Hitler intervened personally on his behalf. Well that's great, isn't it? A dead party big shot. Think of the paper work. Thank you. Walter Stuckhart, 45, Josef Strasse. Please go to this address and ask Herr Stuckhart, where it all began. Franz Luther Franz Luther. Xavier March, to inspect the Bühler residence. ... the Führer today issued and invitation to the President of the United States of America... ... to visit Reich for personal discussions ... Thank you ... allowing greater understanding between our two... For a true comrade, Adolf Hitler. April, '49. Bühler? Yes? Heil Hitler. I swear to Adolf Hitler as Fuhrer and Chancellor of the German Reich. loyalty and bravery. I vow to thee and to the superiors whom thou shalt appoint... obedience until to death so help me God. Jost ... stay here. The others ...! Dismissed! You resemble your mother. We went to school together. Do you like gymnastics? It is part of my training. How long have you been a cadet? Three months Major. Is your father proud of you? He is a founding member of the SS, isn't he? We all follow our fathers. We try... as best we can. I've read your statement about the incident. You've been very helpful. Relax. One thing... You couldn't have seen a body from where you said you were. I checked. So I was wondering ... What you see ... What made you stop? A car ... three men. Nothing else? No... nothing. Then what are you afraid of? Did you recognize someone? Tell me. You'll feel better. At the beginning of term, we had a special guest. He lectured on the organization of police forces in the Reich. I was part of the honor guard. I was this far from him. It was him at the lake. I know it was. So ... who was it? It was the general in command of the Gestapo. Globus? Can you keep a secret? Good! 45 Josef Strasse. Holidays in Greater Germany Madrid, Vienna Caretaker. Heil Hitler. -Yeah. I'm here to see Herr Stuckhart. You are American? -That's right. Are you here on business? Herr Stuckhart? You'll find him on the second floor. Apartment 7. Thanks. Thank you. Herr Stuckhart? Oh my God. Hi, sorry I'm late. Well, don't worry. -Thank you. (Adolf Hitler to meet J. Kennedy.) That's good news. About the Kennedy-Hitler meeting. General Nebe, wanted to see me. Ah, Major March, General Nebe is expecting you sir. Please, go straight in. Xavier ... come. This time next year we could be vacationing on a beach in Miami... or California. -Not on my salary, General. We need the Americans. Without their cooperation, the war in Russia could go on for years. I thought we were making progress Like last year, or the year before it? Switch it off. That's my eldest grandchild. A very nice.... boy. How's that boy of yours doing? He's doing very well. Thank you. I... wish I could live with me. Hmm. -Are you covering the Bühler case? -Er, yes sir. Not any more. This case has been re-designated a state security matter. Gestapo... have taken over the investigation. Police enquiries to be closed. Effective immediately! I do have a sighting of General Globus at exactly the location where ... ... Bühler's body was found. -Sir. -Globus -Yes, sir. Really? -Head of the Gestapo. Walter Stuckhart.... was found shot dead with a whore this morning. Shh... Stuckhart! -Party member from the beginning Wrote the... definitive textbooks on the race question... Retired 3 years ago from the Interior Ministry. I suppose that must be... a matter for the Gestapo as well. Not the Stuckhart case. Not yet. Why don't you dig... just a little further? See if there's a connection between the deaths. Do we have anything.... on the Stuckhart case? Ah... there is the... American... who found him... One of the visiting journalists. She had an appointment with him. We're holding her. Talk to her. Find out what Globus is up to. Nothing in writing. Report direct to me. Yes, sir. Sorry I kept you waiting. Xavier March, this won't take long. In your statement it says you wanted to interview Herr Stuckhart. Yes. He was a founding member of the party and ... ... my editor wanted his reaction to the Kennedy-Hitler meeting. The Cold War is about to end. Isn't that wonderful? Of course. And that was at 10:45? Very well. Oohh.... I can go now? Yes. Er... no. Not yet. Follow me please. So, would somebody like to tell me when I get my passport back? When we don't need it anymore. You've been to Germany before? -No, not since I was a little girl. Nice rebuilding job! You are from New York? Xavier saw a lot of New York in the war, didn't you Xavi? Through a periscope, hunting North Atlantic convoys. Yes. Well... the war's over. We're allies now. Sure, but we know how many people died. -Your raid on Dresden killed 100,000 people. You threatened to drop the atom bomb on Great Britain. -You dropped it on Japan, twice. -Yeah, but we we fighting for our lives! So were we. Oh ... Cute. It's, er, for my son. We go sailing together. Uh,huh. On the lake in the Tiergarten. The young cadet... Jost. I want you to pick him up and put him in protective custody. Discreetly? Yes! Please. Understood. And if you decide to, er, sleep in Xavi, I'll cover for you. Heil Hitler. We need to see Herr Stuckhart's apartment. But Gestapo have sealed it, Major. I know, but I have to see it. But they gave strict instructions that no-one was to be admitted. Key, please. Excuse me. Herr Stuckart live alone? Herr Stuckart was most discreet, but never lonely. This way. Had he lived here long? As long as I've been the night porter. 9 years. Who's in during the day? Nobody! Heil Hitler. That wasn't the man who let me in this morning. You didn't mention man in your statement. I didn't think anything of it. I thought he was the porter. Why have you brought me here? I wanted to have a word with you. So you brought me all the way here just to have a word with me? In private! You lied to me at the station Why? I didn't lie to you at the station. Why did you not see this man? I told you. I wanted to interview him about the Hitler-Kennedy meeting. And it's all my statement. You came there at 10:45. The meeting was announced at 11:30, at a press conference. You couldn't have known about it. You have to get out. Get out! Take the stairs. Quickly. Wait. This way. Take the second elevator. Please, mind your own business. What are you doing here? We sealed this apartment. I'm an officer of the SS. Engaged on official duties. Where is American woman? And what was she doing here? It's been a very long day. Excuse me. By the way, you double parked, you might get a ticket. You're out of your depth, March! Heil Hitler. Thank you. Yes? -You can see almost everything from here, can't you Nebe? What do you want, Globus? I want to.... broaden your horizons. We need to talk. Heil Hitler. Good morning, sir. -Good morning, Xavi. The Gestapo beat us on this one. Let me show you what we missed. It will explain everything. Close the door. Now here we have Kaiser Ferdinand III, by Delois... Jan Christian Hagenberg by George Heydrich ... Otto Schwarzenberg, by Hans Felachen.... and there are at least 35 other well known paintings. Imagine Bühler sitting here, door locked... ...like a dirty old man in a brothel. Well they are very lovely paintings, sir. -As State Secretary in Poland ... ...Bühler had access to everything. He shipped the stuff back to Stuckart at the Interior Ministry. And Globus' men are now looking for Franz Luther of the Foreign Ministry. His position gave him the opportunity to travel abroad... ...and once or twice a year until last week... ...he smuggled most of the artwork into Switzerland. Er, excepting Bühler's rare, souvenir collection. At some point last week, the three of them realized the Gestapo ... ...were closing in, two suicides, Bühler and Stuckart. And there's no doubt a third. When Luther realized this, there's no way out. I... understand... ...this is now in the hands of the Gestapo. On the direct orders of Reich Minister Heydrich, himself. Well... that's it then. -Yes... it is. I found Herr Bühler's prosthetic leg in his closet. So I don't quite understand why he would hop all the way down to the lake on one leg... ... to commit suicide. This is a matter of state security. You're a good promotion prospect, Xavi. Leave this alone..... you could go far. You can't afford to make an enemy of Globus ... ... or of me. Yes, sir. Wait! I think it's time to go home. Heil. Heil Hitler. -Hello Heinz Let's get something. Something warm. I want cake. Excuse me? I want a big cake. One big cake and.... one hot chocolate ... -Please. Happy? Mmm. Who is JC?. I do not know. Where'd you get it? -It was given to me... ... for loyal services to the fatherland after the war. Who by? -Er... -The commander in chief of the Navy, Doenitz ... You think I could have it? Ooh, I er... You can keep it for a while. Can I keep it forever? Yes, you can. I think it's cruel to let them grow up this way, don't you? What do you mean? Because he's crippled and he's never going to get better. Well... what would you like to do? -Well... I thought they should put him to sleep like we do. Who told you this nonsense? -A lot of people. My teachers, my friends ... Mum even. Let me tell you a story... about a clockmaker He was over a hundred years old. Wrinkled face, his hair was white as snow. He'd worked all his life hunched over clocks like this... So... he was a hunchback. People thought he was ugly. People of the village. And they used to call him names. So, he lived on top of the mountain with all his clocks And he worked day and night While he was working all the time, he didn't notice that the hunch on his back... -started to grow, bigger and bigger. And one day.... -when he went out for a walk.... -his nose almost touched the ground. That's how big it was. That same night, he was working, working away on his little clocks... -they suddenly stopped ticking. And he looked up... and he saw... in the mirror... two little... feathers coming out of his coat. And they started growing... they were white, and he looked in the mirror... - and he saw that he had these two big wings... -and all the clocks started singing. - and he opened the window, looked at the stars, and flew up into the sky. Then what happened to him? He became an angel. Will that happen to him? -Well ... We can't kill angels, can we? No It's time to go home. Release the young cadet, the case is closed. Well that's just as well... because he's dead When? Last night. -How? He was training at the gym. He fell and broke his neck. No witnesses? -No witnesses. The instructor said he loved gymnastics. I want an autopsy. On the left temporal lobe a small deposit or contusion was found On the right hand side of the thorax, in line with the arm, two ribs were fractured. Oh, and there was an interlayer hemorrhage under the spinal column covers. The, er, fracture of the spinal column and bruising is consistent with a fall. In my opinion, the death was caused by inhalation of blood into the lungs. If help had come, who knows, it may have been possible to revive him. Before the Second World War, Joe Kennedy had been an exponent of appeasement with Germany. Isn't this initiative an extension of his long held beliefs? Joe Kennedy, as private citizen, was never shy about expressing his concerns ... - about U.S. involvement in what was, at that time, a European conflict. Obviously, once the United States was attacked, it had to respond and Joe Kennedy's views didn't support it. -This initiative is an effort to stabilize relations ... Fraulein McGuire? This is Reich Tourism. Good morning. -Excuse me? Reich Tourism. I have the arrangements for your sightseeing trip. Er, there must be some mistake. -We spoke yesterday about the sailing trip. Oh, well what makes you think I'm still interested? I think you are. ... but the United States cannot live in isolation ... ...put the past behind us and try to forge a future of peace for all peoples of the world. -You only want the one chestnut? -Both. Are you happy? -Yes. Here. Darling... -You're late. I know. -I've been waiting for half an hour... I'm so sorry, go ahead. I couldn't do anything, I had more work. Thanks Reich Tourism? What is this? I have a simple proposition. I'll give you back your passport... If you tell me your little... secret. Er, well, why should I do that? -You stumbled into something quite delicate. You don't know this country. -No, but I'm staying. I know that there's a story here. -It's a matter of state security now. Hitler and Kennedy are about to make news. I'm gonna to cover it. No, I have... a simple proposition for you. I give you my lead. We both follow it. Come on. You're not supposed to be here, are you? I mean, those guys last night.... they were Gestapo, weren't they? They followed you. Or I could go to the Gestapo, I could tell them about our little meeting. I'm sure they'd be interested. You have no idea what might happen to you, do you? Alright. Here. I was given it by a man at the hotel. Never seen him before. These people don't mean anything to me. Huh! I thought you were a cop. The building does. It looks shabbier in the photograph. Good afternoon, welcome to Wannsee. You are visiting someone? Yes, we're making some enquiries. You're a policeman. What is this place? The House of the Blind. A hundred thousand glorious German dead or missing on the Russian front. Cheer now for twenty years .... twice as many wounded A hundred thousand, are you sure? - It's true. If you can't see it , you must be blinder than I am. What was the name of your unit? Good morning, Major, Fraulein. Franz Kruegger. I'm the administrator. Please, can we talk in my office? -Of course. -Follow me. This is a very beautiful building you have. Has it always been a home for the blind? Since the end of the war. -During the war? During the war? You know who sat in my chair during the war? No. -Reichmarshal Heydrich himself. Really? Uh-huh. What was he doing here? Don't know. It was all kept very secret. Now where? -The Reich Archive Fund ... 50 million files on every aspect of the party history. Do you have a moment? Xavier! Hello. Hello Anna. You haven't changed a bit. Don't say that unless you mean it. I mean it. How's Pili? He still stuffing with pastries every weekend? Yes. -I'll need six copies of that. Thank you. He's a sweet boy -Yes, he is. When do you think this was taken? Early in the war. I'll take a guess. Late '41, 1942 Before the really big raids. You see there isn't any blast tape on the windows. Now this was a meeting of some sort? Yes. Why? Xavi! How many meetings do you think there were during the war? Late '41, early '42 ... Wannsee? This is a letter, January 6th, Heydrich ... confirming that the inter-agency discussions at Wannsee ... followed by a lunch, originally scheduled for December 9th, 1941 ... had been postponed til January20th, 1942. -Who was the letter circulated to? Bühler, Eichmann, Freisler, Hoffman, Klopfer, Kritzinger, Lange, Leibrandt, Luther, Meyer, Müller, Neumann, Schöngarth, Stuckart That's it? Yeah, that's it. Anna, excuse me. Who are these people?, I know this is Stuckart. This is Bühler? -Yeah, that's Bühler. That's Hoffman, transport. This man? -Lynn, munitions! A serious meeting? -Yeah. What the ...? They're all dead. I want nothing more to do with this. Please, go! Get out of Berlin tonight. Why? -It's too dangerous, I don't like it. But what about our deal? - The deal's off! This goes to the highest level of the Reich, to ... Heydrich himself. What are you saying? What did they tell you there? -Everyone in the photograph has been murdered. Except one, Franz Luther. They were all high party members. Get out of Germany before it is too late. And don't try and be clever, You will be followed. Tour guides report directly to the Gestapo. Please ..... go home. These were delivered for you, madam. -Thank you. Shall I order you a taxi for the airport? Humboldthain Station, Platform 9. Take any local train, Luther. Yes .... thank you. Districts D, K and Z, all units alert! Humboldthain station ... All units? For a 65 year old art smuggler? What do you want from me? I want to ... I want to desert. You will arrange this through the American embassy. Why should I do that? -I have a story that will make you famous. The biggest secret of the war. Thousands have been killed to protect it. -So what is it? -A terrible crime was committed ... Since then, everyone with direct knowledge of it has been quietly killed by the Gestapo. Only I am left. I have proof of what happened, documents ... papers, photographs, signed orders. They are the price of my admission to the States. You will get your embassy to arrange transportation out of the country for two people. You will need this to prepare our travel papers. Nothing will be the same again. Not for you, not for anybody. Come on, Jäger. It must be arranged today. Where will I meet you? I'll contact you. Hey, hey you! Stop! -Franz Luther, male, 5ft 9inches, Stop him! - a 185 pounds, aged 60. Come back here! -a thousand marks for .... information. There he is! Don't shoot. What are you doing here? Come with me. Why aren't you on that plane? -Luther called me. What would you have done? I'm taking you to the airport where you should have gone this morning. -Get in. Why'd they kill him? Why are they killing everybody? -Why don't you just shut up, for once! Yes of course. I'll deal with it later. Goodnight!! -Globus. -I wanted him alive. Luther. What were my men supposed to do? You were being fired on. Innocent people were being killed. -We needed Luther for questioning. Why? The man was just a common criminal. Wasn't he? A woman was sitting next to Luther in the train. He was seen giving her ... an envelope. Was it the American March took to Stuckhart's apartment? I really don't know. Why did March release the American? -There were no evidence against her. Evidence? Times are changing, Globus. This is the age of detente. If there's anything else we can do to help the Gestapo... ... of course, let us know. Oh, yeah! Yes, I'll let you know. So, what are we going to do? I'll let your embassy know where you are. What? I'm placing you under arrest. Why? When they question you, keep your answers short and consistent. Consistent with what? -The truth, try it for once. You'll be a lot safer in SS custody. -Bullshit. Bullshit, you're scared if you don't turn me in you're gonna die. Well you will anyway. Luther told me that they killed thousands to protect the biggest secret of the war. Look! He gave me these. They wanted the American Embassy to arrange travel documents. Who's that woman? Maybe his wife. Well, if that's his wife.... Who is this? . I don't know. Come in! Please sit down. Thank you for calling us. What exactly did Major March ask you to find for him? Well.... you have to understand, that he's a policeman, and I was trying to help him with his investigation ... Of course.... you were trying to help. Yes! So, when he came to my office ... -You didn't know him before he came to see you? I knew him slightly. Not terribly well. -Not terribly well? No! Are you in the habit of sleeping with people you don't know... terribly well? Go and see mummy. Max Jäger? Yes, what do you want? -We're looking for Xavier March. I do not know where he is. Do you mind if, er... we continue this somewhere else? -Of course not. Good evening, Gunther. -Good evening, Xavi. I... want you to pull a file for me. You're not a friend to have right now. Get out of the car. I was thinking of asking Internal Affairs ... to all of the records of the sexual crimes unit. I understand they will find a lot missing... photographs, magazines, films ... ... very interesting material, including child pornography. Whose file do you want? -Franz Luther. Luther for God sakes Xavi? -Get it! I'll get it for you tomorrow. Happily married for 40 years ... ... one serious affair between 1948 and 1950. ... it was ended because of pressure from von Ribbentrop. See? Same woman. -Anna von Hagen, the actress. She's expecting an American. -Okay. Yeah? -Anna von Hagen? Who is it? - Herr Minister Luther sent me. From the American Embassy? -Yes. So, we are leaving now, huh? It is all arranged? Yes, er... all arranged. Where is Franz? Why is he not here? He's still at the embassy. He's making the final arrangements. He... sent me to pick up the papers. He said if anybody came asking.... I should destroy them. Yes, well, he told me that too. But the embassy needs the papers before they can give you... the travel documents. Ahh! Franz says he's looking forward to sending von Ribbentrop, a postcard from New York ... A very rude one. He loved me.... as much as I loved him. We decided for the sake of the party and the Führer ... ... that he would remain married... and we would... meet each other secretly. It was a sacrifice. Huh! But when one thinks of the sacrifices that some have made ... Huh! So, we'll, um, ...we'll send a car for you ... in a couple of hours. America. Franz says you still have them in America. You didn't do anything about them? All that may change of course ... ... now you have a president who thinks like the Führer does. It was a real problem for me ... making a career in Hollywood. Why? -Jews. They controlled all the studios, you know? They even tried to keep 'em out of Broadway. But the public wanted me, you see. Then they started the war. Berlin was beautiful before the war. The only thing that spoiled it, was the Jews! I have no career left. But I would like to go to America, just to upset the Jews. So what do you think? Did you finally do something about your Jews as we did with ours? What did you do? We put them in cattle cars and shipped them East. Always East. To the Ukraine, you mean to the, er .... the re-settlement camps? Ja, to re-settle them ... in the air. -Excuse me? -To turn them into smoke. They burned the bodies after they gassed them, they had to ... but nobody would ever know. At first, it was a bullet each .... But a child takes as big a bullet as a grown man or woman.... ... and at the height of the war we needed those 6 million bullets we saved. So, er ... 6, 7 million Jews ... ... and then the bullets ... ... for Gypsies, the lunatics, the cripples. So all the Jews were killed? There was no re-settlement? My dear.... I hardly think that after the war there were enough left alive to re-settle a half acre. He was a clever man, Heydrich. One authentic genius after the Führer himself. Oh no! Stuckart was a genius too in his way. He had an entire Reich ministry employed in correspondence with all those Jews in America... ... who wanted to know what happened to their relatives. A postcard every year, saying: "We are well, we are being taken care of." But with the fighting on the Russian front, they couldn't check, could they? And people get tired asking questions when they don't get any answers. The children want to get on with their own lives. The war was over. The Jews were gone. They were ... ... up in smoke. And in two generations time... who will care enough to ask? Well, I should... I should ... be going. You said the car would be here in two hours? Yes. I'll be ready, I'll be waiting. See you later. Charlie. Charlie ... wait! What the hell's going on? Charlie. What did she say? - They killed all the Jews. That's Luther's secret. - We re-settled them. We gave them ... their own piece of land. Xavi, look at these. These are forgeries. Forgeries? -That must be. So Luther, and ... Stuckart and Bühler they were ... they were killed for forgeries? Do you want this to be true? Do you think it's a good story? It is true! Look at them! You agreed to follow my lead wherever it took us. Its brought us here. We can't go back. You knew. -I was at sea during the war. What does ... "Necessity of... of removing biological basis for Judaism once and for all", mean? What does "Final Solution" mean? - I do not know. This is a rail timetable. "One train one day, 60 persons per car, 60 cars per train" ... that's 25,000 people a week. What happened at ... er ... Auschwitz and Belzen? - I can't believe this. What was Zyklon-B? - I do not know Charlie. It's gas. They killed them with gas. Gas. You took everything they owned. You gave them as gifts, to your troops. Jewelry ... fountain pens ... watches. After the war, I beleived ... what everybody else believed. No reason not to. I'm a loyal son of the Fatherland. I served murderers of my life. How do I explain it to my son? They met at Wannsee to plan the final solution. They killed an entire people. Luther and others, they were killed because they were the final link to Wannsee. They were the final ... obstacle to detente. Hitler needed them killed .... before the meeting with Kennedy. - Charlie. If your ... government ... knew ... would Kennedy still meet with Hitler? I don't know. You need to get these documents to your ambassador right away. As long as Kennedy is here, they won't touch him. Do it quickly, and then you should leave. How do I tell my son I served murderers all my life? How do I explain ... this was not a glorious war for national survival ... It's Germany's. You have to come with me Xavi. I cannot, it is my country. - No it isn't ... not anymore. I, can't leave my son. - Well, bring him too! I won't go without you. I mean it. Meet me at the park tonight. I'll find a way to get these to Kennedy ... I promise. Children of the Fatherland ... Today you will be asked to renew your vows to the Fuhrer and to the Reich ... A few moments ago, Air Force One carrying President Joseph Kennedy and his wife Rose ... ... touched down at Tempelhof International airport. ... looking relaxed and cheerful, President Joseph Kennedy was met at the airport ... Hello? -Yes Clara, it's Xavi. Can I ... speak to you alone? -What's it about? ... my apartment. Why can't you come here? I'd rather not argue in front of Pili. It's urgent. OK. OK, I'm on my way. -Thank you. Papa. - Hello son. Close the door. - What are you doing here? Mom's just gone out. I wanted a word with you alone, without a mother. Come here ... now. Are you not well? - No, I'm fine. Open your mouth. Show me your tongue. Alright. Now, you remember we talked about America? - Yeah. Do you still want to come to America with me? When? - Now ... right now. What about mom? - Just you and me, Pili. We... ...have to explain it to her later. How long will we be gone? A long time? - Yes, quite a long time. Okay then. Okay, yeah? - Yes. Excuse me, but you have no badge. Oh, er, I'm press. - Fräulein, you can not go in there. Wh... what why? - Because you have no badge. O .. Oh yeah, my ba..., my badge fell off. -I'm sorry. I have a badge, but I should be on a list, er.... Charlotte McGuire. Fräulein McGuire, your name is no longer on the list. - Yeah, but... you... you know who I am. It is alright, she belongs to the group. Yeah? Thanks. ... yeah, we're looking to see if in about an hour or less .... Elliot, I've been looking all over for you. - Hi Charlie, sit down. How are you? Listen, we have no time. You gotta take a look at these. You gotta help me. You're the only one who can get this to this president. Are you coming? Change your mind? We'll fly to New York .... ... find a place to live. Maybe we can even live on a boat. You'd like that, don't you? Yes. Alright ... then tell me ... what bothers you. I need to know. - You're sick. Sick. What are you talking about? The Gestapo told me. - Gestapo? What do you mean? - They want to help you. Did you tell 'em? - I phoned them. They lie. I lied to you. Listen ... son, you're a big man. Now, you need to learn to think for yourself. Wait here! Don't move! Bastard! Come on Charlie .... I see him. There he is. Charlie, you go on in. - Please let us through. Mr. President ... Mr. Ambassador, you... Mr. Ambassador, you ... Mr. Ambassador, you've got to see these. Mr. Ambassador, stop the car. Stop the car. You've got to look at these ... You've got to show them ... You've got to show them ... Mr. Ambassador, Mr Ambassador, look at these pictures. Mr. Ambassador. You've got to show them to the president. Attention .... Attention. Because of the Bolshevik bomb threats these celebrations are hereby canceled. President Kennedy is returning to America immediately ... ... and takes with him the good wishes of the German people. Dear boy ... hurry up, please. Son ... listen to me. It wasn't your fault. Don't believe them. You gotta ... grow your own wings ... - Papa! - Where are you? - Grow ... - Papa! - Grow your own wings ... Papa ... I used to wonder why she never got out ... while she had the chance. But she and my father were the first to see those images of horror ... ... the first to know ... ... and that somehow linked them forever with each other ... ... and the victims. So she sat on ... until the Gestapo came for her. Everything has changed. Without the American alliance Hitler's Reich collapsed. Of course, there are some who say it never happened. Those who look ... and do not see. The years since have been difficult ones ... ... but my father would be proud to know ... ... that no longer are we all living in the house of the blind. Think I could have it? Oh yeah ... You can keep it for a while. Can I keep it forever? Yes, you can. Perhaps we all do want to follow our fathers. I would be very proud to follow mine ...
