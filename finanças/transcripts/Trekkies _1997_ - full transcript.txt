I didn't watch Star Trek the original series before I was on. I looked at the styrofoam rocks and said, "Forget it." ...means, "Can you speak Klingon?" Give the right answer or else! I dance at powwows, I'm into the Indian way of life and I'm also a Trekker. It's the greatest feeling in the world, and I do it about 30, 40 times a year. To walk out on stage and to feel that love that pours right out at you. It's just fans! I grew up with it, so I couldn't help but be a fan! This is the Andorian ambassador, Ed Vark. I am Guard Number 48, and this is Guard Number 28. You have to understand that even now, I still have an ongoing process of trying to grasp all of this. The name's Douglas Marcks. I live in Portland. I've been a fan of Star Trek for a number of years. I started watching it back in the '60s. I've been in this for seven years and it's becoming normal. In 1987, I auditioned for Star Trek: The Next Generation. I admit I went to this audition with some hesitation. After all, it was a re-hash of a cult status sci-fi series, and it had a profound effect on the original cast members' careers. But since I was unknown, unemployed and unclear as to where any of this was headed, I went. What I didn't know was that I was becoming a part of something much larger than just a new TV series. I was becoming part of a phenomenon. I'm John Paladin. My Klingon name is Kruge. I'm Harminder Pal from Glasgow, Scotland. - My name is... Who am I? - Lieutenant Commander... I'm Lieutenant Commander Horatio, from the starship Battle Queen! I'm Steven Silverman from New Jersey. - Canton, Ohio. - San Diego. - Melbourne, Australia. - Berlin, Germany. I have fans that write me from Germany, Italy, Australia, England. I've been to conventions in all those places. - How many conventions? - Probably close to 50 or 60. - Really? - You gotta have something to do. - This is my third convention. - We've been to 20 or 30. - I lost count, you know? - I've been doing this since 1969. This is my 366th convention this weekend. I have attended over the course of eight years 28 conventions. I'm preparing to go to the Pasadena Star Trek Babylon 5 Convention. I'm going now to pick up my new tailor-made First Contact uniform. - Hey, Travis. - Hey, Gabriel. - Come on in. - Linda dropped it off? This is the uniform featured in Star Trek: First Contact. Linda Thuringer, our club's captain, outdid herself here, except I have some quibbles, like this red stripe. In the movie, it's half this thickness, but she can change that. The lines running across here are more prominent, but she can do top-stitching there. She wanted to take the legs down, but I don't see why. Overall: fantastic! - This'll be your car? - I hope so. I'll be 15 in June. - A year later, I'll get my licence. - It's the Roddenberry. I wish it could fly to another planet. - Someone never grew out of the '60s. - Yeah. I spent a lot of time in vans. We'll put a laser beam on the front, so we can shoot a 1,000-foot beam. I'm Lieutenant Commander Barbara Adams of the USS Artemis, the Little Rock Unit of the Federation Alliance. I'm here at the convention in Boston where I've brought some things. Many people are interested in what I did in going to the trial in uniform. I was selected for the jury for the Whitewater Trial in Arkansas. Many curious people have asked about us and looked at my drawings. I study graphic design and I enjoy drawing the Star Trek people. One of our charters in the Alliance is to perform community service, and, as Commanding Officer, I'm the role model for my crew. So I felt it was necessary and a good decision to wear my uniform. For a week, everyone's seen the picture of Barbara Adams... Each morning, there were more reporters, waiting to see if I was coming in my uniform. It got to the point where it was just a wall of cameras, and I had to walk all around them to get to the door. It just got ridiculous. My brother had a picture of her walking out of the courtroom. One of the papers reported that I had a "Vulcan-like stoicism". Wow! They came close to the truth, 'cause usually, before the trial, I would always come to these conventions as a Vulcan. The bus driver I'd met kept asking, "Why do you wear the uniform? "What if the President comes to testify?" I said, "I'll wear my uniform." "But it's the President of the US!" "I'll wear my uniform." He turned round and looked at me and said, "You are a brave woman." Every day, I wear my communicator badge, rank pips and tricorder. To me, as an officer in the Alliance 24 hours a day, even out of uniform, I want that known, that at heart I'm a Star Fleet officer. I read about her in the newspaper, and I got her autograph. Basically, the philosophy behind Star Trek that she is so... ...promoting... ...is the philosophy behind an honest juror. A jury needs an open-minded person. Based on Star Trek ideals, she'd be an asset. This is what she wants to do, this is America. We should look how we want. She's a pretty neat lady to have the guts to be herself, even on such an important thing. You can put on a uniform for football year round and nobody cares, basketball, nobody cares. Put on a Star Trek uniform, people giggle. I don't want my officers to feel ashamed to wear their uniform. So I went to a civic duty, what we do is community service, I performed my duty in my uniform, just as any officer in the military would wear theirs. - I came to meet the stars. - To see a personal side of the stars. While I was in Florida, Ruth-Anne gave me this buckle on my 138th birthday. Now, every time I see someone, they say, "You're so much younger in person." The first one that I did, I think, was around '72. I got a call to come to New York. They had done one convention, and it wasn't really a convention. They got together with 35, 40, 50... The way I heard this story. ...fans of Star Trek that wanted to get together and talk about the show. And they said, "Why don't we put our money together, "and rent a hotel ballroom?" "And talk about our mutual interest and show what we've collected, "in the way of tapes, paraphernalia, photographs?" "If we could get 300 people to attend, "we could pay for it." And I thought, "They're inviting me to New York? "They're willing to pay expenses and fly me there?" I thought, "They're fools!" And there were something like three or four thousand people there, and it was absolutely wild. They had to call the fire department and let them in in increments. Everything came to a stop. It was jam-packed with humanity. The revolving doors couldn't revolve. Escalators and elevators stopped. And the din out there indicated that there was more than 30 people. The woman went on stage to introduce me, I stepped out and the place exploded in applause. They were hanging out of the balcony, it was like over-aged Beatles for me. There was hardly a chance to speak because every word created a roar. A wall of emotional sound hit you. We were all taken aback, and moved and touched by it, because of this tremendous affection. Now there is a Star Trek convention... There are Star Trek conventions somewhere every weekend in the world. Hi. Could I have a schedule, please? Definitely gotta see Majel. She's on stage now? - What time is the auction? - 2.20, this afternoon. OK, this was worn by John Colicos in which episode? "Blood Oath". This is the turtle, as they call it. Michael Dorn calls it the Great Turtle. "Turtle Head". There's "Speed Bumps". Whoopi Goldberg says "Old Intestine Head". The other one I heard is "Rocky Mountains", the latest one! Here's the opening bid for this: $500. $500! We've got a $500 bid! And it's there... ...to a Klingon! - $550. - Six! 600. 600. Do I hear 650? - 650! - A thousand. $1,000! $1,000! - Eleven hundred. - $1100! - Twelve hundred! - What? - Twelve hundred? - Yeah! OK, $1200. - $1300! - Fourteen! $1400! Going once, $1400! Going twice, $1400! Sold! - Qapla, man! - Qapla! I was bidding on the headpiece and the price got up too high for me. - That Klingon really wanted it. - Yes. - How badly did you want it? - I wouldn't have left without it. It's a little bit of history that I'll preserve. I collect the items when I can, and they're wonderful to have. They're definitely one of a kind. Everything we touch, a piece of hair or a nose, something small, there's a cult market out there where pieces sell for thousands of dollars. What we see in these rooms could run into the millions, if we opened up a market on the outside. Everything's under lock and key. Unfortunately, John de Lancie couldn't make it to this show. We have an autograph... The Q-Virus was the most bizarre thing. John de Lancie, who plays Q, barely made it to the convention. He was really sick, very ill, dizzy, questioned whether he was going on stage. He went up on stage, did his show and left his water glass. I held up the glass and joked, "Who wants to buy the Q-Virus?" But the crowd went absolutely crazy, they went bonkers for it. So I went ahead and auctioned the glass for $40 or $60. A guy bought it and I said, "Look..." It was half full still. "...you don't want to drink this, he's very sick, very ill." "Oh, no! I wanna drink it!" He downed the glass right there. "I've got the Q-Virus!" He planned to spread it all over the world. That was his thing. I was walking down a street in New York, and somebody said, "Are you Q?" I said, "Yeah." "Can you bring people back from the dead?" I went, "Er...only people I like." And he goes, "Cool," and walked on. There was a fan who, in 1973, came up to Jimmy Doohan and pulled out a hypodermic and asked Jimmy for a blood sample. A woman stood up in one of the conventions and said, "What's it feel like to be beamed?" 20 years later, at a convention in New York, and the same guy came up to him with the hypodermic and said, "Can I get a blood sample?" He was doing the same thing 20 years later. There's one gentleman who, for about ten years, almost the whole run of The Next Generation, has been sending something in the mail every day to Star Trek. Every day. But it has nothing to do with Star Trek. He sends us travel brochures... And that's all he sends. And postcards from his travels. Or sometimes... Look at this one. We've got a Victoria's Secret catalogue that he sent. Something about a mission. A fruit trees and landscaping catalogue. Caribbean, Hawaii, Canada, Australia. He sends postcards about his lunch, how much coffee he drank. It's always to Star Trek, but never about Star Trek. We wonder who he is, where he's from, why he's sending these things. Over ten years every day, that's a few packages. All right. Let's go, please! Exactly. OK, here we go! - Rolling! - And...action, please! Maybe you didn't read the crew roster, but my name is Dax. I'm the new science officer on this garbage scow and you are in my seat! And cut! Very nice. There was a man confined to a wheelchair called Jordan LaForge. The man was given six months to a year to live. He attributes the fact that he lived for many years after his prognosis to watching Star Trek. Finally, when he did pass away, Gene thought that having somebody in that place as Geordi would be a perfect example... a nice thing to do in memory of him. Originally, Geordi was the ship's pilot, so the blind man flew the ship. I watched the original series when I was a kid, and I enjoyed it. At this point, I enjoy his enthusiasm more. I enjoy the shows. I enjoy the conventions. I like dressing up. I love dressing her up. But I enjoy his fanaticism. It's contagious! And what makes you a fanatic as opposed to a fan? The fact I'm so into it, I do a lot of collecting, I relate to so much of it. I know a lot about it. It's more than just a casual... I enjoy the show, the concept, I'm really into it. This is the Trek room. This is my room, I can design it the way I want. Although it does spill out into the other areas of the house. This is the bathroom, and we've carried the Trek theme in here. We have our Star Fleet towel set. Our Federation blue tile here is offset with these hand-painted Trek tiles, the planets, the Enterprise and one of the enemy. We asked to visit Cape Canaveral, Nichelle and I, and we peered in a porthole and there were astronauts working inside. They turned around and looked and recognised our faces peering in. You should have seen their eyes light up! They came scrambling out of there, and the first thing they asked us was, "Can we have your autographs?" We went to get their autographs, and they were asking for ours! Star Trek came along at a time when the public was hungry for that adventure. It went a long way to stimulate interest in the space programme. Star Trek is a cultural icon, it's part of the lexicon now. As a psychotherapist, I have Star Trek stuff in my office. I use Star Trek metaphors that everyone understands. If someone has a defensive reaction, I talk about the shields going up. Everyone understands, even non-fans. The front part of my office is a straight forward surgical office. My own private consulting room is filled with Star Trek stuff. I'm Denis Bourguignon. This is my son Doug. My wife Shelly, and my daughter Kayla. We're here in Orlando, Florida, Denis's dental offices. - Good morning. - How are you? Welcome to Star Base Dental. We decided to go with Star Trek because the episodes are always geared with a moral. They're good-doers, and we wanted to portray dentists as good-doers. - So, this is reception. - Yes, where patients check in. This is our holodeck, where I do my work: fillings, crowns, dentures, things like that. We were in a sci-fi store one day, looked at each other and said, "Are you thinking what I'm thinking?" and we said, "Let's try it." Two weeks later, we bought up everything we could find, and, boom, we did Star Base Dental. Our transporter's up on the ceiling. It transports you away from here, while we're working on you. These are nice pieces over here. These are my cement handprints of the stars. You're about a James Doohan size. He's missing a finger. A gardening accident. This is the first theme office I worked in, it's really neat. It's different coming to work. You don't know what's around. He brings something different in every time. You wonder what's gonna be on the walls that wasn't before. The uniform I wouldn't do at first. That was impossible for me. - How long did you hold out? - Almost a year. I was the last one. - What made you turn the corner? - He told me I had to! She cried a few times. We dress up at home in different characters, and it helps our... Relationship, yeah? Like going out with different people! I haven't done you yet, I'm not tall enough, so he puts a wig on. - Then I have to be Data. Or Quark. - Sometimes Quark. - How do the patients respond? - Most of them like it. The Star Trek theme is great. It takes your mind off where you really are. It's not like any other dentists', that's for sure. Most people, even if they don't like Star Trek, like the idea. I've only had one person who didn't like the idea, but he wasn't happy about his bill in the first place. Afternoon, Preston. Good to see you. Let's get you going. Let's take a look here. Number two...occlusal. Number three, crown. Shelly and I started in another office about the same time. She was the receptionist. After a while, she liked dentistry so much, so I brought her back and I taught her to assist. We worked well together and made it a bond for life. We're together now forever. I'm dressed as a NASA astronaut, whose death was investigated, in an episode called "The Royale" of The Next Generation. That was the original idea. Then I kind of moved on, kind of character-developed it a little bit. Instead of it being him, it's his wife! What is your interest in Star Trek? Mainly Brent Spiner, Lieutenant Commander Data on The Next Generation, as you know. I know him well. You guys call yourselves Spiner Femmes. Spiner Femmes? I like that. I think there's a series in that! My Brent page. When somebody else discovers him through my page, I feel good. Let other people outside the Star Trek universe know who he is. This is where I keep, right down here, all the important collectibles. I've got videos, T-shirts, mugs. The important stuff. If there's an earthquake or fire, I want this to be intact. These are more convention photos and more convention photos... It goes on for days. I put them in facing the same order. Once I get through with these, it switches to ones this way. It saves having to turn the photo album every two minutes. Palm Springs Convention. I took over 100 pictures there. When I got them back, I took a picture of all the pictures. Lots of enlargements. I had a calendar made up one year for friends. That's my back right there. It was a Texas stamp with a sheet about the background of Texas. I ordered it from the post office and framed it for him. I don't get much stuff any more, 'cause I said it wasn't necessary, and it wasn't a good idea people spending their money on me. I expressed that we do OK, and they should save their money. It's not the money. It gives me a good feeling. I do that for my friends, too. I like to get unusual gifts for people. After living here a year, I found where Brent lived... I can't see his house, but I can see the hill he lives at the bottom of. So when I'm stressed out, I come out and take a "Brent Break", and just gaze off in that direction and daydream for a while. What do you like to do at conventions? - Ever heard of "filking"? - No. Science fiction folk singing. - Could you explain that? - I'll give you an example. Episode of the original series called "Space Seed", which launched the second movie, The Wrath of Khan. There is a song called "Vow of Vengeance". It's Khan's vow. Let's see. The summer sunlight The howling at night The blood of friends spilled On the sand Amid some quick death She breathes her last breath And dies as I cling to her hand Mere mortals you be The truth you can see You think you have right But... It's been a while since I've sung it. You think... Action! - An alliance with the Borg? - More like an exchange. If we teach the Borg how to modify their own probes, they'd have a blueprint to create a weapon to fight the aliens... When I am asked to go to a hospital, it's a specific boy, and he's not going to be there the next time I go. It means a lot to him that I be honest with him. That can change your life. There's a woman almost totally paralysed, and she was able, through an interpreter, to say, "For the hour that you are on, "I forget the body that I am imprisoned in." I got a fan letter from a young lady. It was a suicide note. So I called her and I said, "Hey, this is Jimmy Doohan... Scotty from Star Trek." I said, "I'm doing a convention in Indianapolis, "I want to see you there." I saw her. Boy, I'm telling you... I couldn't believe what I saw. That was definitely suicide. Somebody had to help her, somehow. Obviously she wasn't going to the right people. I said, "I'm doing a convention two weeks from now in St Louis, "and two weeks from then..." She also came to New York. She was able to afford to go to these places, and everything else, so... That went on for two or three years, maybe eighteen times, and all I did was talk positive things to her. Then, all of a sudden, nothing. I didn't hear anything, I had no idea what was happening. I really never saved her address, right? Eight years later, I get a letter, saying, "I do want to thank you so much for what you did for me, "because I just got my master's degree in electronic engineering." That's...to me, the best thing I've ever done in my life, and it brings tears to my eyes every time I even talk about the story. Over several years, we've raised several hundred thousand dollars for these charities. This is what Star Trek does. It's part entertainment, part philosophy. This part of Star Trek goes unnoticed to the public. Have you thought of talking to teachers and schools about it? Can you organise that? I teach kindergarten so it's hard for them to grasp racial diversity. So if you have a show like Star Trek that shows different aliens and different people getting along, it illustrates that point wonderfully. Star Trek has changed the way that I teach science, specifically space science. By giving children an immediate frame of reference that they know and get excited about, it inspires their imagination. This is something we've been excited about, having Kate Mulgrew portray the captain on the Voyager. They feel it's the first time they can view a woman in a leadership role as a family, without having to discuss what she stands for. She is so obviously a woman of authority and strength, but she's not a witch with a capital "B". She's just a person in authority. I get a great deal of mail from women who say they watch Voyager with their daughters, and how good it feels to be able to point to the screen and say, "See, you can be anything." - What do you want to be? - An astronaut. Mae Carol Jemison, the first African-American woman in space, became a scientist and an astronaut, because she saw Nichelle Nichols on Star Trek and said, "That's for me!" There were two little girls around eight or nine years old when Star Trek first came on, and one of them told me years later, "I looked on that television, "and I saw you. "I saw this black lady, "and I ran through the house screaming, 'Come quick! "'There's a black lady on television and she ain't no maid!"' And she said, "I knew right then and there "I could be anybody and anything I wanted to be." And so she decided to be a superstar! Her name is Whoopi Goldberg. - I'm Joyce Mason. - I'm Evelyn DeBiase. We host a radio show called Talk Trek and Beyond. One lunch hour at work, and we thought about Trek. It's something we do a lot of, so we decided it would be a great radio show. I called the directory assistance for the number of a radio station. - She asked me... - "Which one?" I didn't know, so I said, "Pick one," and she picked out KAV. We went over, two weeks later we were on the air! - First time. - Seven years ago! And we're still on! It's been a lot of fun. We didn't know what we were doing, but... We still don't! ...convention on the air. Evening, how are we doing tonight? Welcome to Talk Trek and Beyond. We're delighted to be with you. We have a special guest with us. - Denise Crosby. - Denise Crosby! Yeah! Are you ready? Our listeners are dying to talk to you. - John in Portland on line one. - Hey, Portland! - Hi, you guys! Hi, Denise. - Hi, John. Without"Skin of Evil", there could've been no "Yesterday's Enterprise". Right. Exactly. There's irony in that, isn't there? I always felt I had to die and get off the show to get the best episode! I love talking to you like this. When the show originally aired, my father passed away. A lot of my friends were Trek fans and around me at the time, and we sat down and watched that episode. Strangely, at the end with the holographic message, it helped me a great deal. Now I get to thank you personally which I appreciate and still do. John, I'm really touched. So many times, people don't realise just how important a show can be. It can destroy you or, as in a case like this, give you comfort. Yes. Between the ending and the holographic imaging and the clouds, it was what I needed at the time. I don't know how to say thank you for that. - Thank you for Talk Trek. - Thank you for being with us. There's nothing like a bunch of Trek people sitting and talking. They'll go for 24 hours or more. That's why it's called Talk Trek, because it's not just about Trek, but it's a whole universe within itself. Just like people talk French and German, we talk Trek. - What does your bathtub look like? - It looks very green! - Who's your favourite captain? - Captain Kirk. - Captain Picard. - I'm a Kirk fan. - Kirk, 'cause he was the first captain. - The original, the prototype. - Absolutely Kirk. - Captain Jean-Luc Picard. - Picard. - Picard. A very handsome man, Captain Picard. - Who's your favourite captain? - Data. - Data's not a captain. - I don't like any captains. Who's gonna beat Captain Kirk? Come on, he's a stud! - I'd say Janeway. - Janeway's a stud, too, but... - Janeway. - It's split between Janeway and Kirk. - Kirk. - Avery Brooks, 'cause he's cute. - Who's your favourite captain? - I am. I couldn't pick one captain over another. - The Emissary. - The Emissary! He is most important. But to place the others above the Emissary would not be right. When I got the job, everybody said, "Oh, the Trekkies!" In fact, they're very smart. One has to be smart to connect science with the imagination. That's what's interesting to me, that a show could have fans that span and bridge every sort of classification. Stephen Hawking, Mel Brooks, Dr Marvin Minsky, who's head of robotics at MIT, or the Mercury astronauts. Accountants, lawyers... just people who enjoy the programme. There's a preconceived notion that they are peculiar people. I haven't met anyone, Star Trek fan or not, who wasn't peculiar. We're all peculiar. The word "fan" is an abbreviation of "fanatic". There are some people who fit that category, who need to get a life. But most fans are pretty normal people, who have a hobby and a sense of the desire to escape. They know it's a show, but it's just fun. We are the largest ship in the San Diego area. We do community service, we go and visit children in hospitals. - We're having a mini-golf tournament. - Dressed as Klingons? - You play, dressed as Klingons? - Yes! For money for charity. I'm Marc Okrand and I've developed the Klingon language. ...our only greeting, translates as "What do you want?" For Klingon softball, I never devised words for "You're out", so they improvised with "You're dead", "You're alive", which works. I like the way Klingons believe, their code of ethics and honour. What I've done is tattoo the Klingon insignia. It took two and a half hours' work with a home-made pen. This is a Klingon Disruptor Pistol. Two basic settings. That's the stun setting. Never have I heard it used in Star Trek. Not just in the movies, but people like to speak the language. The Klingon Language Camp we've had for the last four years. It's a summer programme to learn the language, customs of the culture. How do you say "kill"? They just came out with the first edition in Klingon of Hamlet. A team of scholars are working on translating the Bible. They've translated the theme songs to Sesame Street, Gilligan's Island. - Klingons are really popular. - Very popular. - It's an interesting phenomenon. - You said that with a straight face. Klingons are popular because they're fun. Klingons allow us to express a certain aspect of our personality that we're not allowed to do in public. I want to get the sour cream and chives potato. - With cheese or without? - Without. Without cheese. Just combo? OK. Would you like super size with two large fries and a drink? $9.56. - Ever served a Klingon before? - Yes. - You've served Klingons before? - Yes. When I was six, January of 1989, I attended my first convention. And here is a picture from it. One day, I got a phone call at home, and Gabriel at that time was six. The school says, "Would you pick up your son?" I said, "Is he hurt?" They said, "No. "He's wearing his Star Trek uniform and his pointed ears, "and this is not the right attire for school." It was a Catholic school. They made me pick him up, which was funny. It took him years to understand that he couldn't go to school like that. I was supposed to wear my plaid pants and tie. - Another interesting thing... - I'll get that. Hello? Peter, this is the worst time to call! Go away! Bye. Around this entire section here, we have my collection of autographed Star Trek action figures. Over here, I have the collection of the four captains. Sisko here might look a bit messy, because I shaved it with a knife, as it's his new look this season, and I painted on a goatee. Over here, I put up a chart of my Datas, illustrating the change in uniforms in the past few years. We start here with Data in the first/second season jumpsuit, which caused the actors backache. Then, the third through seventh season two-piece uniform. Then the Generation's jumpsuit version. And now, the grey-shouldered First Contact garbs, which, of course, I'm wearing now. I normally dress up as Data. One lady thought I was Data. She came up to me with her baby and said, "Will you touch my baby?" I've been asked to bless people. One wanted me to sign the interior of his car. To marry people. "Wow! He touched my baby!" and she ran off screaming. One wanted me to help him ease his way into death. Odd request. Maybe we should've told her I wasn't Data. The Mark and Brian Radio Programme, 95.5 KLOS. There is a Star Trek convention here. Trekkies from all over the world. In celebration of that group, we give you the Star Trek theme. - I'm a little dizzy now. - We'll take a commercial break. - Do you have a favourite episode? - The original? - Of course... - The original? He shouldn't even be in this. He doesn't even dig Star Trek. I like Star Trek. You're like, "Who are those guys with the pointy ears?" Star Trek's a way of life, man. It teaches us all. This background was rendered by me. It's the Nemesis station from Star Station Nemesis, the film project our club is working on. This is the screenplay in computer form. This is where it was written with all the modifications. This script is basically the back story conceived for the club. I translated the outline rewrote into the 172-page screenplay. What you're about to see are some of my fledgling opticals. There's a considerable amount of detail that went into it. This is a pan-up shot that I did. There's flickering I'm trying to remove. I've been tinkering around with a Romulan Armada shot. I rendered the sequence in two parts. This is the logo for the movie trailer showing at the next meeting. Gabriel and Travis had an idea to make a movie for our club. Gabriel designed new uniforms specifically for the movie. - For your approval. - There's yours. We're still in process. You have to decide which one to wear tomorrow. Yeah. That'll be a tough choice! This costume I designed out of fifty conceptual sketches, and this is my favourite from my film project. It should be noted that this is only a prototypical version. The collar on the completed version will come to here, but she cut it short. It'll have shoulder pads and will be all wool. This has some wool and some polyester components. The first version looks nice. My friend does custom tailoring, so he does my uniforms. I have a dress uniform, I have a couple of T-shirt tops. This is a jumpsuit. This is normal attire for me. We don't feel we look different 'cause we've been doing it for so long. Sometimes, I leave work with my uniform on. People will be staring at me, but to me it's just natural. I go out a lot in the uniform, and I find it a positive thing. I sometimes get people smiling, they'll say something or give me a Vulcan salute. I've never had a negative experience. I enjoy it. Occasionally, people have asked me, "How long are you gonna do it? "Don't you have a life?" But this is part of my life. - Hi, Steve. How are you? - All right. As long as I'm able to do it, I'm going to do it. It doesn't hurt anybody. It makes a lot of people feel good, and that's the point of things. I'm going inside here to search for new Star Trek memorabilia. I spend around...maybe... $300-$400 a year on merchandise. But, if I could, I'd spend a lot more, way over $1,000. The reality is Star Trek fans devote more time, energy and finance to their object of affection than any other group. I'm a die-hard Star Trek fan and I'm trying to get everything before I die. This is the Data Redemption red Playmates doll that's very rare. I got it for $25 at a convention and now they're worth $250-$300. Not that I'll ever sell mine! These dolls are numbered. They look for the lowest number. I'm about to trade for these figures worth about $100 apiece, because they were limited to 10,000 for the rare Thomas Riker figure. I'm getting the better deal, because the production number was lower. It goes for more on the secondary market than this set. - These are from Huntsville. - The only place to get them. Some were numbered over 10,000, but that was a mistake. - Interesting. Thank you. - Those are the legs from Spock. - How do you know? - I'm on the internet. I'm keeping those for myself. My folks would get mad because I'd talk about it all the time. I love the wonderful Star Trek stuff. I'm 27 years old, and I still collect and love it just as much. The Super Phaser Target Game, pretty hip for the early '70s. Star Trek: The Motion Picture: The Pop-Up Book. The hottest thing when I was a kid! And these are Star Trek 1984 drinking glasses. In 1989, with Star Trek V, the special offer was for a futuristic marshmallow dispenser. So I sent for this thing, and here we go! It's still intact, like mint in a bag. This stuff has overtaken my house! One of my goals is to build a great big shelf where I can display it. When we started doing the Star Trek cruises, the fans came for quality time with the stars. Each fan has their picture taken with all of the Star Trek celebrities. What's the passport? It looks like a US passport, but it says United Federation of Planets. We filled it out. You pick them up at the conventions. I went to Honduras and Belize, and they just stamped me in. In fact, I even have one... Scary. US Immigration. February 7, 1994, they stamped me in. Coming is Jimmy Doohan's director's chair. My wife is flying in with that today. - That'll be for sale? - Yes. Here's the sign. - That's worth what? - $375. I don't know if it's worth that. We hope it is! It's hard to put a price on that. It could be worth $1 million! Whatever you collect, you can find here. At a typical convention, you'll find a plethora of Star Trek merchandise. Here we have some gorgeous cardboard stand-ups. I must get one. A nice collection of various novels. A set of figures I just traded. Ship diagrams and blueprints, bookmarks, jewellery. Uniform adornments, software, plates, CDs, lithographs. Calendars, phasers, model kits. I love building the model kits. I've just put the finishing touches on Voyager. The nacelles fold, as you see, on this series. One little problem is this is coming apart. The Voyager doesn't have saucer capability. I became a dealer because I read too many Conan books, and I got interested in swords and armour, learned how to make armour. Then we went to gun shows and carried the armour on the table. In 1991, the 25th anniversary Star Trek cards came out, and I got all excited and bought a few too many boxes, broke them all for sets and there were sets left over, so we took them to the gun show, put them next to the armour, and they all disappeared and people asked me for this and that. The armour moved farther off the edge of the table, and now these and those have taken over everything. My company is doing cookie jars. They're 30th anniversary Star Trek cookie jars. I've collected 759 autographs in five years of the Star Trek characters. This is like Christmas, ripping open all these packages. She got me hooked on the cards. I'm addicted. - All you have to do is buy one pack! - And you're addicted! I've been in printing for 11 years. I work in the bindery department. Many people think she's strange and wonder what she's really like. Honestly, she's very well-educated and intelligent. She takes her job responsibilities very seriously. But people think she's not very intelligent, whereas she is. Bobbi is a little bit eccentric, but it's a good quality eccentricity. Customers do think it's strange sometimes. Everyone's got their quirks, and we work around and with those. When I first came here, I was meeting everyone and getting names. For Bobbi, they said, "This is the Commander." Commander! Do we have enough 80-pound rich gloss? - Yeah. - OK. Thank you. - Commander. - Yes? Which job? When I first called her "girlfriend", she didn't really like that. - I said, "What do you prefer?" - My rank is Lieutenant Commander. "'Commander' is what I'll call you!" She started telling me about Star Trek that she was into. She was commander of some spaceship locally. Did she explain what she was wearing? Yes, one's a phaser and it beams her up. The other's something else. I've never got a negative response. Some customers recognise me from the trial but don't say anything. Has it encouraged you to watch Star Trek? Actually, yes. Only because you want to understand what I'm talking about! I'm not a Star Trek fan, but I get into it because she's into it. My favourite fan letter I received, I opened it up, and there was a marijuana cigarette glued to a piece of cardboard and a photo of a very delightful-looking young girl. And she said, "You have turned me on so many times, "I thought I would return the favour." I kept that one. I've saved some great stuff that fans have sent me: ink drawings of Chekov, Captain Picard, Saavik, Dr Crusher. A woman named Jean Cluge drew me in a Davy Crockett motif. This is from Blowing Rock, North Carolina. "Tasha and Sela together again." This is a kind of King Arthur, Knights of the Round Table motif. Sela, looking tough. A lot of times kids send me things. A nice Lucite box. This is Tasha, done in needlepoint. It's my favourite. This is a very imaginative pose! At first, I tell you, I was shocked. Then, I've kind of grown to appreciate it. What was weird was not just how they got my naked body perfect, but yours was almost specific! Are you filming? Star Trek is unique in that we are the only television show that has an open script submission policy. We will take scripts from anyone. I once had a fan come in dressed in a Star Fleet uniform, who called himself Ensign Jones. All of his stories had to do with Ensign Jones taking over the Enterprise, or Ensign Jones goes to the Klingon home world, or Ensign Jones travels through time. I write in the original Trek genre, involving the characters of Kirk and Spock. I write "slash" on the internet. - You're talking about the K/S 'zines. - The Kirk/Spock fetish groups. The term means one character with another, like Kirk/Spock. We thought the studio would put a stop to it, but they didn't care, because it's small circulations. We're all very normal ladies, mostly housewives... ...who want sexual stories about Kirk and Spock, but not with other women. The mailing list is completely anonymous. Why is it important that your identity not be revealed? Because of the controversial nature. We're living in a culture that isn't as progressive. It's important to avoid censure. I write The Secret Logs of Mistress Janeway. It's about how Mistress Janeway beats Tuvok with a riding crop. That was interesting. A fan made this out of an X-Men figure, repainted it complete with whip, cat-o'-nine-tails, handcuffs. Another fan wrote a Klingon sex manual. "There's no safe sex in Klingon." "Is your daughter seeing a Klingon?" "Initiating the mating ritual." We both pushed each other and wrestled... That is part of the Klingon culture. The female pushing or slapping a man is like, "I find you attractive." I threw it away, but they had made, from latex, a Klingon condom. It was ridged. Big ridges. There are now thousands of K/S scenes. It's too late to stop it. I'm Daryl Frazetti and this is Bones. We've been to a dozen conventions together, because he enters the costume contests. It's something fun to do together and with the people we meet. He's got a med-kit here, his props. This is the original Trek scrub top, and this is the science insignia. And his DeForest Kelley pin that he always wears for luck. We're bigger classic Trek fans than the other shows. DeForest Kelley is our favourite actor. He will sit there and watch television. Some cats will. Some actually respond to the phasers or the ships going by. We're here for this convention. We're old friends who met through Star Trek, and it's our 13-year reunion for the four of us. We're so divergent in personality, backgrounds and family styles, and yet we have this common thread of Star Trek keeping us together. The first convention we went to, we've forgotten what it was like. We were accepted, and when we went home, we had to act normal. The one thing in this world that I'd take to my grave is the fans. They are so loving and warm and tender. If you go into a convention and you don't know anybody, you really do, because they're all thinking like you are. My family thinks I'm the odd one. They think I'm totally weird. But I found this club, so I guess I'm not so weird after all! It's great to go to a convention and it's like a family reunion. My wife and I actually met at a Star Trek club. I know many people that I'd never have met without this club. It's about meeting people. We set up a recruiting table to get new members to join the organisation. Recruitment happens every moment. Every time you see one of us, in uniform or out, we're recruiting. We belong to two international fan clubs, the United Federation of Planets International, and the Romulan Star Empire. I'm Linda Thuringer, the Captain. My Romulan name is Aoife t'Livett. I am the Commander of the Romulan Praetorian Guard. Steve Menagh. I'm the First Officer and my Romulan name is Menhall tr'Hellan. I'm the sub-commander of the Praetorian Guard. I'm the Security Chief and a member of the Romulan Star Empire. - My name is Teris T'No. - I'm Chief Medical Officer. At first, I was afraid to come, but it was a lot of fun. But this group is unique and the people are educated. They know a lot about science, and it's neat to be with such people. It's fun because it's the only place I can think of that you can goof off, and grown-ups goof off the same way about the same subjects. - Are you a Trekkie? - Totally. How do you say "Trekkie"? ...means "I'm a Trekkie." "Traveller" is what it means. - Are you a Trekkie? - I am. I am a Trekkie. Not card-carrying or the kind that wears uniforms. He is a card-carrying Trekkie, his credit card says Star Trek on it! I'm a Trekkie and a Trekker. Every serious fan considers themself a Trekker. - Trekkie? Trekker? I don't understand. - It's a generational thing. The Trekkie either saw old Star Trek when it first came out or started in with the reruns in the '70s. The Trekker primarily started in with Next Generation. Trekkers seem to be snobs. "I'm not a Trekkie, I'm a Trekker." Trekker sounds pretentious, but it's preferable. A Trekker is a Star Trekker. They are walking with us. The Trekker is motivated, in motion. The Trekkie is neutral, benign, harmless, who just wants to watch. I am a Trekkie. Actually we're called Trekkens, but I'm a Trekkie. "Taking a Trek? We're not Trekkies, right?" Then we're watching the Trek. But the Trekker comes with us. A Trekker is somebody who enjoys Star Trek. They probably have a small collection at home, they go to Star Trek conventions and sometimes dress up. A Trekkie lives their life according to the Star Trek laws. I prefer Trekker, but I'm not as adamant about it as other fans. I don't like the Trekkie/Trekker labels because of the negative connotations. If you say, "I'm a Trekker," people make rude comments. I'd rather be known as a Spiner Femme. I usually refer to myself as a Star Trek fan. I just forget about the Trekkie/Trekker debacle. I first met William Shatner on the Tonight Show. I got the name of the casting director and sent her a package, found out that he was due to be a guest. They wanted me to do a quick spot with him. He was a gentleman. My name is James Kirk. I changed my name because since I was little I wanted to change my name to something I would enjoy. Something more befitting my character. I've had ridicule, but a lot of people go, "I wish I had the guts to do that, just change it to something I like." And I go, "You can do anything you want in life." I'm with the starship Riverside from Iowa. The town's famous because Kirk says he's from Iowa. About 12 years ago, Riverside proclaimed to be the future birthplace of Captain James T Kirk. So far it's been a boom to the town, with a Star Trek Fest every June. We get three to six thousand people to the parade and carnival. It's just a boom to the town. - Jimmy, my boy! - Happy birthday! We've been having this party for years. Every year it gets to be more fun, more people come. It started off small and now younger people are coming. This year we had a girl come. I foresee it going on and on. It's a fun bonding thing we do. Every year, I whip up my famous Romulan concoction. - I won't reveal the ingredients. - I like the Vulcans, they're logical. That's why I like Spock, he's very logical. At the conventions, there's a lot of Klingons, and being a Vulcan, it's nice to stand out. The Vulcans are obviously smarter than the Klingons as well. I drove down through Calgary today to look at the Enterprise, the model we have here in Vulcan, Alberta. I'm impressed with the beautiful job they've done. It's great that in Canada the town of Vulcan has adopted the Star Trek theme. We enjoy having people from around the world to talk with and share their stories of Star Trek. I'm visiting Vulcan because of the convention. Obviously it's a Vulcan community. My heroes are Spock and Tuvok. Some people have fake Spock ears, but I have the real thing. As you can imagine, it's been 30 years of an amazing experience. I was at a party many years ago that Paramount was giving, and a lot of movie stars were there, and the place was packed. I felt a pair of hands on my shoulders. And somebody whispered into my ear and said, "I recognise you. You had your ears fixed." And it was John Wayne! Everybody was doing ear jokes in those days. I got a kick out of that. There's a great deal of my personality that is Mr Spock. I try to function on logic, intelligence, not get carried away with emotion. I consider myself half Vulcan. I did draw the line at having my ears surgically altered to points. It was too expensive. I'll tell you the real truth... I... ...if I had the money, I'd do it. I don't march to the regular drummer. - You'd go through the pain of...? - I really would. And it's not so much... Yeah, I really would. I like to be different. This is a unique way of being different. It's a non-invasive, non-harmful way of being different. Even if I have pointed ears, I can still function in the world. It just makes me more different, and in a positive way. But I won't be getting it tomorrow. I would hope he couldn't find a doctor willing to do that, personally! This is Computer. Hi, Computer. This is my dog. All this stuff that Star Trek predicted is coming true. The talking computers, they're better now than in the original series. People are intrigued by the speculative technology on Star Trek. My buddies would have Farrah Fawcett posters in their bedroom. I had the blueprints for the Enterprise. I started to build this from the episode "The Changeling", where the computer robot is going to destroy the Enterprise. Another project is the Romulan cloaking device. I've started it here, as you can see, this is the main power generator. This is the round part here of the actual cloaking device. I think I can modify it like in "The Enterprise Incident". I can modify it for use on a Federation ship. I've built a lot of stuff, like a communicator, a phaser. The one that's the coolest is Captain Pike's chair, after he was crippled from radiation burns. This is Captain Pike's total life-support unit. It encompasses the entire body except the head. It supports life and takes him wherever he needs. The beautiful simplicity of it is that you can ask a yes or no question, and for "yes" it's one blink, and for "no" it's two blinks. So if you ask me a question, I can answer with a yes or no. It's motorised, so I drive it around parades. Hi. Is Craig around? He set aside some parts for me. An HP 12-volt unit, some transistors and a relay. I talked to Craig about my Nomad project, and he said I could use the 3.9 ohm resistors or the 2.70s. Could I get away with the 2.70s? My next project is to build a dilithium chamber, and I'll build some anti-gravs, too, and maybe an M-5 computer. I'll connect my house with Jeffries Tubes. I've lots of projects to do. Star Trek has had a lot of impact on the future. We have cellular flip phones, nuclear-powered engines that'll take us to Mars. All science fiction now is true. Star Trek has always been a fun part of my life. It motivated me to go to the Air Force Academy. It encouraged me to study. As Star Trek took place in space, it turned my interest to things such as astronomy and astrophysics. As a result, I got my bachelor's and master's in astronomy, and I now work as a data analyst for the Hubble Science Institute. I really liked Spock's logical mind, and that pushed me into a logical field, computer science. It's unbelievable, it's had such an effect from an educational angle. It's affected all of us, all the actors have received so much mail. I get a lot of mail from parents who tell me, "We appreciate your positive role model for our son." I very much support the future that Gene projected as far as elimination of hunger and elimination of poverty. Star Trek has a really neat message. The whole infinite diversity and combination is very attractive. I wish the world would grasp it as beautifully as the fans have. People of all races, religions, political backgrounds, sizes, shapes, are all equal at a convention and nobody is ostracised because they're different. That attracts a lot of people, because elsewhere they don't have that freedom. This weekend was great, because I went to the convention, picked up some great stuff, met some cast members, talked to them, shook their hands... The most wonderful thing. I also got to meet many fans very similar to myself. They're great, gorgeous people, who know how to place Star Trek in the proper context with the rest of their lives, and that's a unique gift for fans. I met a very wonderfully talented lady who was a political cartoonist, an English lady. But when she saw Star Trek, it gave her a vision, not of a world necessarily that she could live in, but it gave her an understanding that there were people who were thinking those thoughts. Most people like Star Trek because it expresses issues that can't normally be expressed in today's society without somebody coming down on you. My father grew up in the Nazi era in Poland, but he was protected as a German citizen. When he came to the US, he realised his principles were wrong. When we watched Star Trek, he'd say, "This is the right way to think." Like treating people as equals and with respect. I hope that everybody can get along in the future. We struck a chord with the youth of this country, particularly those who came back from Vietnam and the hippies. Plus it came at a turbulent time, when the future of society, the planet, was up for grabs. For the first time, people on television saw themselves... ...men and women, as equals. I like the hope and the chances it gives people. Especially gay men and women, in a world that's not accepting, there's a dream that one day there will be acceptance. Gene Roddenberry offered a vision of hope and that we'd have a future. Not only did we not annihilate ourselves on this planet, but we are going forth. What progress! With a sense of adventure! Gene said there'll be a tomorrow, a better, kinder, more gentle world. He talked about the things that bugged us in the '60s and disguised them, because the network would never let us talk about politics or war. We couldn't mention the black/white problem, so we painted Frank Gorshin half black and white, and his adversary was half white and black. It looked so ridiculous that everybody said, "Hey, we get this." My basic prediction here is that Star Trek will become the blueprint for the 21st century. The philosophy, the ideals, the Prime Directive, they'll all be a genetic map for a better future, a better mankind. My feeling is that we had a great time for 30 years. There were tribulations and trials as well as triumphs, but the consensus is of a very positive nature. I don't want to be one of those people still talking about it 20 years... It's 30 years after the fact. God, I am one of those people! No! At these conventions we'd say, "It'll last another few years, "and that'll be it," you know? Ten years later, we were saying, "Well, it'll last another few years." Twenty years later, "God! It'll go on for ever!" I don't think it will ever die. Something like that can never die. You've got a phenomenon, this is our 20th-century mythology. That's big. I don't know, I hope it lasts for ever, it's a good thing. As long as it's thoughtful, it's a good thing. - Remember, live long and prosper! - Goodnight. I want to thank all of you. I want you to know I'm a Trekkie, too. I love Star Trek, and all I can say is this... Glory, glory Hallelujah Star Trek's truth is marching on His truth is marching... Ladies and gentlemen, live long and prosper! A-huh! Thank you! Thank you! I am a big Star Trek fan, I got beat up most of my life for being a Star Trek fan, usually by sports fans, which is ironic. Someone that's really into football will wear the uniform around town. If I put on my Klingon uniform and go to Safeway, I'm a geek. "Excuse me, these yams have no honour!" "We boldly go where no man has gone before." When they get there, there's someone waiting for them. James Kirk as an archaeologist. "Bones!" The Prime Directive is you don't tamper with cultures, 'cause you're so advanced, you get that one thing you need and go. He didn't pay attention to that at all, man, "Your Bible is a lie! Everything you believe is wrong. "Freak out! I'm the bloated God-being from the sky!" There's always that one minority that gets beamed down and disappears. "OK, James, Bob, Bones... and Rodriguez." Rodriguez is dead! When they get down, Jim goes, "Rodriguez, check behind that rock. "Regular cast, stand over here!" Of course, there's a brain-sucking plant behind the rock. Rodriguez should say, "You check the rock. "I lost two cousins on this show last season!" Remember the three brains with the gambling problem? "I bet 400 on the newcomer! Where are you from?" "Earth." "What's the spread on the UCLA game?" One day, you'll have Klingon comics. Worf as a comic. "Thank you. "It's a pleasure to be here at the first Ice House on Klingon. "Remember in school when your teacher would anger you, "forcing you to kill him? "My father would be so proud, he'd hold my hands in flames!" "Scotty, how are the engines? And don't use a metaphor!" "Aye, sir. The circuit clutch is cross-wired... "...like a Christmas tree on the Fourth of July!" "No, Scotty! How are the engines?" "Aye, they're overheated, sir... like a supernova in August!" "No, Scotty! No metaphors!" "Can I use a simile, sir?" "An allegory? An anecdote?" "No!" "The Klingons are here!" ...a 14-year-old kid, never kissed anyone, and there's a holodeck on the ship. If I had a holodeck... ...when I was 14, I'd never have left the thing! "Where's Weinhold?" "Holodeck one." I'm climbing out of a giant... "It's time you saw Counsellor Troi." "This is Counsellor Troi!"
