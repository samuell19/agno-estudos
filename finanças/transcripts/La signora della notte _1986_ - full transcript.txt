Stick it in me! Push him hard into me! Simona! Simona! I want to marry you! Why you do not answer me? Don't you want to marry me? Michael, you're the best! Cockie, what are you doing here right now? Go to bed! Come! LADY OF THE NIGHT (ANGELINA) One, two, three, four ... One, two, three, four ... One, two, three, four ... One, two, three, four ... Okay girls, it's time to shoot the beast! Giulianna went after you! I'm going to have a drink. I'm almost thirsty. Come on girls! Work! Leave me alone! I don't want to deal with you anymore. You disgust me, bad man! Bruno, where are you going? Come back to me! You got the wrong floor, Mr. Bianchini. This is the third floor. Ah, hell, and I have to climb a lot! Do you play the violin, not the joke? Yes, but not for long, I swap it with a guitar. But you also play the piano very well as far as I can hear. You can hear the sound on the floor. Oh no! The piano is for those who take music seriously. I have to go now! Then I wish you good luck! Good bye! Oh, hello Cuckie! Simona! I'm here! Why didn't you try to arrest her? I'm crazy about her. That's exactly what I wanted! We called the company and they will pick it up on the terrace with a crane. But you don't need a crane. We can break it to pieces in two minutes. I can already imagine her there. It will look great there. We will finally be able to invite someone to dinner. What smells so good? Something special, which I cooked. We'll have dinner by candlelight. It will be very romantic. I'll be back as soon as I take a shower. Don't be late, the food is ready every now and then. At least my gift to you is small enough to fit in the door. Thank you! I think it cost you a monthly salary. That's why I make money, I hope you like it! Yes, it’s simple, but nice, I mean tablets of soldiers in the military. For Marc, with love from Simona, October 10, 1982. exactly at 9:30. At exactly the same time, three years ago, we were married for six hours. I think it's too late to change your mind, right? You give orders! You are my commander! Everything will get wet. It's not important! Forget it! Hey, are you okay? What a happy boy I am with this rain! When you know how to be awkward, you don’t even know how to undress me! Were other men in your life better at it? Don't you get jealous again? No, but you could tell me the truth about it. It's not important. How much, come on, tell me! Everything that used to be is gone. Only you and I matter now! I never want to see you again! Leave me alone! You disgust me, bad man! Bruno, wait, come back! Bok Simona. Bok Cuckie! You are very sweet. I'll buy a puppy like you! You will not do that. There are no men or dogs, so Marisa agreed. You haven't met my new roommate Barbara yet. I'm glad! Me too! Come on, Marisa, we have to go if we're not late. ALRIGHT. Hello! Hello! I think it's late. I think my watch stopped. Hurry up! What are you doing with that? The teacher kept complaining. You know how it is! He will never solve anything with this attitude of his What the hell do you think elevators are? He says he's afraid of getting stuck between floors. You'll tell the carpenter that, won't you? I will strive, but I promise nothing. Maybe he'll come tomorrow. But someone could steal it. I'll take care of her, you don't have to worry. You can scratch it or worse. I do not think so Looks like it's your property. It's cute. It's half past seven. I'm sorry, you can take Cockie, I have to run. Thank you! Forget the keys, you're very nice. Yes very well! Thank you! One two Three! One two Three! Hello! Yes, wait a minute, I'll call her! Simona! Your husband is on the phone. I'll be there in a minute. Oh, give me a coin for a cup of coffee, please Giulianna! Thank you! Hi Marko! Hi, I wanted to say we're going to a party tonight. Maybe yes. I am open to offers of any kind. There is nothing extraordinary. You feel capable of walking. Still better than nothing, I think. Then it remains. Ah, I wanted to forget. You don’t have to buy anything. So come straight home. See you later! Ah, hello! All the information is in the computer, no problem. Okay, tell me you're coming to the party? I'm definitely coming! I couldn’t stand it anymore, if I didn’t run away, I would die! They only talked about engines and planes. But what do you think of dinner? It was like they were serving us on international flights. All that awful menu, with steak chicken and dehydrated vegetables. When they started serving that instant coffee with powdered milk and cream, that was the end of it. Someone had to tell us how to put on the belt. Cockie, what's up, will you pee? Then the master will take you for a little walk, okay? His master has other plans, he will watch the boxing match. They have a special program tonight with historical matches, which is why I left the party. Marko, it's your turn, I was with him this morning. And I often took him in the morning and evening. You know I'm scared at night. Don’t be silly, it’s only 11. Turn the block for two minutes and come back right away. Hey, this is Sugar Ray Robinson! Then let him pee on the balcony if you're scared! That's how bad learning is! Come on, get up and get him out! Are you doing what I asked you to do? I'm going head, straw, come on, take the money! I know I'm going. I fell for the money. Come on, Cockie, let's hurry! If you want, I'm going! I hate you! What a good dog! Come on, Cockie! Hey, what's wrong with you? Stay! Good night Simon! Get back to hell here! It's just your damn bitch! What are you doing? I ask you a simple question! You're superb! Look at me! I want you to look at me while I put it on you! Marco! Yes! You love Me? Yes of course! I'm in love with you! You would never leave me, would you? I want you to swear to me! You know I wouldn't leave you! Come on, I want to sleep! I'm looking forward to getting started. Look! No thanks, the coffee I drank almost made me vomit! What's been wrong with you lately? You can't stand anyone anymore! Let's not exagerate! Don’t tell me you’re in trouble with your husband because I refuse to believe it. You have always been different from others, special! What’s so special about me? You and Marco have always been together. I don't see you arguing. Who told you Michael and I were arguing? Nobody. I was just trying to figure out why you were so grumpy. See why I told you. You are very nervous I want to know why men are always the root of women’s problems? I mean, women have sex all the time, and it’s all pleasurable for men. That's really crazy! Are you cheating? To deceive me? Yes, with someone else. No, I know he wouldn't do that. I met someone else. You're joking! No, that's right! I am revolted, an evil individual, but there are the most hidden passions in me. I did it in the car, leaning against the back of the door, even in the mud. I think you're slowly going crazy. You took it seriously. I was joking too! I don't have a lover. Our life is normal. There is nothing dirty here. One, two, three and! One, two, three and! Home, husband, work and weekend. Home, husband, work and weekend. Simona, you are crazy! You could have killed us. But can I know what's wrong with you? First you drive like crazy, and then you stop here. I want you to make love to me in the car. I haven’t done it in over 90 or 95 years. Remember when you took me to the countryside and we weren't married yet? You lowered the seat just before you stopped the car. At home we have a much more comfortable bed. Cut it out! Someone doesn’t really believe what he’s saying! If anyone passes by, they could look at us and see. I better drive. I'll make up for it in bed at night. Leave it, it doesn't matter! Hey, what did I tell you? I almost went crazy. No one realized what was wrong with the engine. Until I found out that only one screw is missing. Nothing bigger than a piece of this pasta that I’m just swallowing now. Still, it created a problem with the engine. Marko, please, you are very boring. Okay, I forgot about our deal. See what's going on? When I stop talking about work, I have nothing to say. Hey, look out, wine is not water! I’m a little thirsty and that’s it. Let's look! Here's how I run! A real work of art! 3000 cubic centimeters 120 kilometers per hour. Remote control. All-wheel drive is a miracle. I also designed very nicely during my student days. Of course it's a little outdated now. Do you mind if I talk to these guys a little? If you want to go! I will feel good walking around. Alright! Hunters! Hunters, go to hell! Hi, beautiful lady! Hello! Hello! What's your name? Simona. How much money do you have? Honestly, I don’t have a lot of them! Hell, it was right around the corner! I bet that scared you a little? To shoot! To shoot! To shoot! To shoot! Marko! Tell him! Nothing! To wait! It is very good, thank you! It does not need to be repeated. You will get some spaghetti as a gift. No kidding, forget some patterns. You have a very beautiful, very photogenic body. Want to shoot commercials? I’m not too busy with my job already. Thanks anyway! Don't shout, it's an armed robbery! Forgive me, but I had to see you again and talk to you! I haven't slept at night since I saw you that day. Get out of this car and never bother me again! I'm sorry, I know it's a little rude of me, but I had no choice but to approach you on the street. I knew that if I called you, you would hang up immediately. I could have come to the gym, but I didn’t want to gossip about you. Marko! I can not anymore. Almost an hour's drive from downtown Olympica to home. Traffic has become hell. Olympian, it makes you think about fast racing, instead you wait until you get a headache. You walk a few feet and stop, and a few feet and stop again until you start to lose all hope. Yes, I like it, it's good. Hey, where are you going? Come back! Simona, open the door, let me in! Simona! I'll break down the door. Simona, open the door! Open Simon! Can I have fun with you too? I can handle it, I don't need it! Leaves! Leaves! Finish! You never know when the time is right. I never reach orgasm! I never reach orgasm! I never reach orgasm! Don't give up, try again! You will arrive, relax! Release if you reach orgasm. Do not worry about me! Who is? Marisa. Hi! Hi! It came to me by mistake. It's yours. Thank you! How is it? Good good! In a couple's life. Anyway, most of the time it’s okay. I was pretty sure you would say that! Goodbye, see you later. Good bye! Hello yes! It's me, can I come in? Give me a chance to talk to you for a moment, now that you’re alone! Please don’t leave if you don’t mind too much! I need to see you again! Give me a second for my own good. Go away, please go away! I will not open this door. Of course! I beg you, my dear Simon! I will shout for all your neighbors to hear! I hope you like it! When you find a free moment to tell him ... Can you speak louder, please! When you find free time to tell her that, tell her I’m sending her a kiss! You're not helping me at all. But you know the rules, don't you? It's my turn to cook. And who went to buy food? Do you want us to play before they come? No, I'm not playing with you. I've already beaten you five times, what's the point? I practiced a little too. you won't beat me so easily now. Why not wait for your friends? Do they know how to play? How do I know? I've only known them for a week. I thought your pilot friend was coming with his wife. The pilot went to India. We better not talk about planes tonight. What a relief! It has nothing to do with me. But how is it, is it fine? Well, I hope she's good. What do you mean you hope? How do I know? She could be Dracula's sister. Is it okay. So will it be some kind of surprise party or whatever? Come on, it's going to be really nice! I mean, it’s because of the people we usually call. He is a very well-read man and knows many things. He deals with advertising. I met him at work while filming a commercial. What is his name? Ettore Rossati. What do you got Simon? You only do nonsense every time, right? A table that doesn't go in the door, you always just talk about motorbikes, you make me go out at night with the dog, And roll over with a doll, invite a stranger here to have dinner with us. You arrived on time, please come in! Hi how are you? Let me take this! My name is Ettore Rossati. What's your name? Simona. I hope you like these flowers very much. You shouldn't have bothered! Thank you! I admire your taste! Oh, vampire video game, I like it! It's my favorite game. Can you play? Of course I know. Dracula must suck as much human blood as possible, without receiving the policeman's silver bullet in the heart. Before dawn. Of course, he's just a vampire. So he returns to the sarcophagus. What a great idea to use mineral water for orchids! I didn’t earn a lot of points. Like me, right? Do any of you drink anything? Yes, thank you. We have a special cocktail, Simona's creation, ownership is reserved. I think she's better off with a little ice, but she's not entirely convinced. If this is her creation, it would be better to add a little water. Try it first, then say how it is. May I ask if you work? We both couldn’t stand my salary. So what are you doing, Simona? Why don't you answer Simon? He goes to aerobics classes. What a terrible coincidence: aeronautics, aerobics. I think you are the perfect combination. I think I need to get some ice. If you're still going to the kitchen, get me a lemon. Look, I'm doing better, see how many points I earned? It's very good. I'm already a little jealous. Do you mind if you let me out? I understand what a woman you are, Simona! You don't need flowers, you need to be taken by force. Simona, come with that lemon! What are you doing there now and picking it up from the tree? I bet you'll fall first! They taught you that in school, didn't they? Wonderful, wonderful! I won! You were great! I mean, Ettore’s daughter is a professional model. Daughter Ettore, I can't laugh anymore. You heard what he said, Ettore, I'm your girlfriend! You know that would be a good idea. No, you're not my type Valeria! You are too open-minded, too knowledgeable. I am attracted to women who have an aura of mystery. And married, but whores, right? Reputable whores, right? But it seems obvious to me that you two are somehow together. We are like brother and sister. When did you first become a couple? Legally, three years ago. And for now, well, right? Simona, right? Yes, you are my boy. Still, something is wrong between you, I feel it! It's time for another drink. Midnight cocktail. No Thanks. This is my cocktail. I would love one, so how about we go for a walk on the beach? All together, passionate. Sounds great, I think we're going for a walk on the beach. I like this picture. It’s delicious, given the theme. I didn't choose him! My husband’s pilot friend brought it to us from India as a gift. But it didn’t help much, I think. Your husband is very masculine, but he lacks sensuality. Yet it is an incomplete picture. For example, this is missing. Leave me alone or scream! I don’t think you have the courage to do that! If you’re hysterical, just complicating things, you should explain that we’ve already met. You haven’t told him that yet, and there must be a reason why you haven’t. You certainly have something to hide, and this is that I am the person you have suffered with. Your lover. And now I'm out! Count Dracula, come! Oh, your wonderful cocktail! Here are the results. That is it! Take that chair. Hold him! Sit down! Are you OK? A glass of whiskey will correct you. Four whiskeys please! You better give us some coffee. Come back now! Let's shout now! Lean forward! What are you doing? Get your hands off me! Please! Shout for help, shout for your loving husband! Come on, call him! You look better now, come on, drink it all! Please have coffee. Good. Bog! Don't tell me you're ... European middleweight champion between 1949 and 1954, right? You like me to dress him like an animal. Fuck you, dominate you, fuck you in the ass. You like dirty, don't you? Yes, because I'm a bitch. Simona! Hector! Where are you? What are you doing?! Damn it! I'll kill you! Stinky pig! No stopping! Please stop! Poor worm. You bastard! No Michael, please! Why? Why? Why? How could you do that? You make me throw up! I don't want to see you in life anymore, stinky bitch! Holy God, who knows when this elevator will be repaired ?! That’s too much for a girl who works all day. Simona! You pick up the others! Simona! Simona! Gives. You're worse than my father. And he sometimes locks himself in the room all the time and his mother has to bring him food. But now you are exaggerating. But what do you think you are dealing with this way? Attention! You're back at the gym again tomorrow! You have to occupy your mind again and you have to start over. You know I can't feel it! But it's been two weeks since you've been locked up in the house. I feel a little guilty that I can’t do too much to help you. So now I think it's time to help yourself. But you did so much! Hey, even if I could have done more. To get you out of the house, to laugh a little again. No sense in trying this with me. How could I forget? Giulliana, I'm sorry I'm such a damn bitch. Ma, stop talking nonsense. I feel bad when I see you like that. I think I'm crazy. I don't even know how something like that could have happened. How could I be so weak? I don't know what happened to me! It was like I was sick of not being able to do anything at all. I felt like I was getting hurt. I was a completely different person. My pleasure was mixed with disgust. But what haunts me the most is that I know I hurt Marc. He believed me blindly, he believed in my innocence. He knows me much better now. I'm glad he found us both. As far as I know Marc, it's not over yet. It will come back to you, you will see. Hello! Ah, you are Marko! In the lawyer's office. All right, I'll pass that on. I can take care of the dog if it bothers you. In fact, I think he will keep Simon company. How about a minute with her? No Marko, how do you want me to know? You better talk to her. Hi Marko. It's me, Marco! Marko! Hello! Hi, nice to see you. Simona is fine, isn't she? As I know. I'm single again. Can we go out together if you want? Maybe you introduce me to your friends. Or better yet, one day have dinner together, what do you say? With pleasure! Ok then. Hello! Good bye! One, two, three and ... One, two, three and ... Hello! Look, I managed to change that, Simona! What do you think? Let's show a little enthusiasm too! At least look at her! Look, it looks like it was made for you. It will get you back on your feet. Giulianna, you just know I can't feel it. You just don’t want to be a nun! All I wanted was to make you go to the theater and you promised. And the boys have already taken the tickets. But who am I? You know who Giorgio is, he came to pick me up from the gym a few times. Bring a friend who you will really like because he is a very dear person. His name is Giulio. He just became a doctor. What a good coat! It was from my mother. It’s a bit old-fashioned, but it looks great on that black dress. I think I'll go to bed with Giorgio soon. It’s a little late considering we’ve been out for six months. Six months, you know. Giulliano's calculation finally warmed up. What should I do? Oh, God, spare me more! There are two friends we wanted to go out with. What kind of fun is it if we go out in threes? Okay, but I'm only doing this for you, I'm not interfering, okay? I do that for you too. If you don’t start going out into the world, you’ll go crazy. Do you like theater? I prefer cinema! What do you think of the song we’re watching? Interesting, but a little difficult. Imagine there are two more hours of standing. Want to skip the rest of the song? I would be much happier to do that. Then we eat together. Of course. Don’t you think we should tell the others? Maybe you should. I'm sorry, my friend, but I wanted to tell you to skip the rest of the show. He doesn't waste much time for a shy young man. Well done Giulio! What is the result? Do you want a table? I'm paying you for a short tube. I pay you double for that. What happened girls, are you deaf and dumb or what do you have? When did the last reel get stuck in your throat? You think you're too good for me, don't you? Where are you running to? Fuck the whore! Do you want something? Yes, beer please! Poetry number 32 I dedicate to the young lady of the night Please, my sweet Psidilla. My treasure, my love. Let me come to you tonight. And please if you tell me to come. Do not have the porch already closed. And be good, don't leave home. Because without ever stopping, I want to shoot her nine times a night! Cookie! What happens to the dog? How do I know? Yes, maybe you should see what’s wrong with the dog. Come on, go! Go to bed bad dog what are you! I'm going home. Don't go, wait! I'm sorry! Do you really have to leave? Yes, it's very late, I have to go home. But you can sleep with me! No, I prefer to sleep alone. I have exams tomorrow and I really have to study. I hope to see you soon. It was a delicious meal, especially a dessert. Do you mind if I come unannounced as many times as I want? Yes, every time you run out of parties, come to me. Oh, Marco, don't be silly. Good night. Cockie, where the hell are you? Come on, wake up! I'm sorry, boy! I'm thirsty! I wish I had seven grits so I could put them over you. At the same time. Even in the nose? That! Both in the nose and in the ears. I am happy with the one you have. If you put it where I tell you. If we change roles a little bit, you wouldn’t be able to do that. Maybe I could. How? With this? I think you're crazy! Oh yeah! That's terrible! Let me try! I won't hurt you. Really. What the hell are you doing? I forgot the keys to the house and am waiting for Giulianna. But it is dangerous to stay on the street at night. Something bad could happen to you. Why didn't you remember that when you sent me with Cockie after midnight? It was not the same situation. I'll take you ... Simona, come home with me. It's so easy. You forgot ... You better look at me. I was just causing you trouble. I'm not good at anything. You better go out with Maris. what has she got to do with all this? She is young and approachable and is a better wife than me Here, I'm waiting for you. Simona! How did you get here? I've been looking everywhere for you. Good night! How did you get here? I wanted to take a walk. And did you want to stay here on the street and wait for us? I've been here since 11 o'clock. You forgot to take the keys, didn't you? Of course I forgot. When I had to choose a specialization. I opted for gynecology. As for pregnancy, it all seems so fascinating to me. I am dedicated to the female sex. You know what I mean. Men love women. Your hobby, your passion. So you don’t care about anything else about a woman. You don’t have to take everything ad literam. Maybe I'm also interested in a relationship. Are you interested in me? You just broke up with your husband, as Giulliana told me. Is that all you know? He didn't tell me much about you. I cheated on him very often. A betrayal that still makes you feel guilty. You can now be free to do whatever you want. That is not the case. I am too inhibited to be free. Why can't we go to you? I live with my mother. Do you mind? I understand, no marital memories. I also have a gynecologist's chair there. Come on, go. Where the hell is that tent? Hey, no music! they become upset. Can I help you? What do you want? We are waiting for you. Why? I thought ... I don't think we have anything to say to each other. Simona, I want you to forgive me. I feel lonely, please come back to me! Very funny. No sense in telling you now - I don't wanna ruin the suprise. Be patient! I hope you will explain to me again and again. I have no explanation for you. We said goodbye forever. Please don't go like that! Whatever it was, I forgot what happened. There is no point in pretending, it’s all over and you know it’s best for us to keep separate. Simona, you may or may not care, but I'm still crazy about you. I want to make love to you! Oh, Marco is not well. I guess others shoot you day in and day out, non-stop. Who's shooting you, Ettore? It's none of your business! Or someone else. Who? Do not touch me! Do you need help? Not! The doctor is now ready for you. Simona! What a pleasant surprise! Why did you come? I want a consultation! I'm glad you came to me. What is bothering you? I decided to take off the spiral. How long has it been introduced? Almost two years. Did your husband know about him? That. Is there a problem? Is there inflammation? Not ever. Giulio! Have you concluded that you want to have a child? Yes, finally. Yet it could be harder now when you don’t have a husband. If that could happen, I know it would be a fundamental change for me. I need something that makes sense, responsibilities, someone to protect myself and protect myself. So Simon, who do you want to be a father? It takes two to have a baby. I do not know yet. If I need you, am I here? I am thinking of you. Giulio would be a good choice. Hello! However, Giorgio prefers the Peruvian type. Don't be silly, you chose the right one, she will like it. I will spend Christmas in the countryside with Giorgio and his family. And only that idea pulsates me, oh God! Merry Christmas. Happy celebrations! Do you like something? Just like the meal Marko gave me for my birthday. Yes Simon, that man is still in your mind. How could I betray everything I had? Help! But Cockie, I think Simona is here! The chain was so delicate. So I put stronger. Go and change. The meal is almost over. For us! I drink in our honor. I'm so tired. Hey! Calm down! Don't be in such a hurry! You excite me so much! How can you afford it? Why don't you want to be bad? Do you know what to do? On your knees! Oh Michael, Michael, it's going to be a boy! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! END
