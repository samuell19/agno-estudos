Pass the ball! Here. (Recording Room) Is this how I taught you to take pictures of objects? No. Ahn Ji-ho, do you know what day December 18, 2018 is? No. It's the day the whole country declares war on those who sneakily take pictures of other people like this. If today, other teachers caught you, then colleges, works, marriages, etc., your life is doomed! I'm sorry. Ahn Ji-ho, stand up. And here you want to go to Seoul University... Are you out of your mind? I was wrong. If you did it again, I'd kick you out of school, you hear me? Yes. Wash your face and go to class. Don't let others know you were beaten. Thank you. Ahn Ji-ho. Why are you sweating so much? Oh... I played basketball, and it was a bit hot. Im Sung-min, stand up. Did it hurt? You already knew by looking at it, why would you ask? What? It's just... you are going to be my brother-in-law... Don't think of me as your student, consider me as your brother-in-law... I went easy on you because I consider you as my brother-in-law. If you weren't my brother-in-law, punishment wouldn't just stop at expulsion… Alright, I know. But… please don't tell my sister. I would die if my father knew. Then why would you do this? I told you that Ji-ho took it. I just asked for the picture files. How about we call Ji-ho back? Or you can check my computer. (Student Information Full Name: Ahn Ji-ho, Gender - Male) Such a Mom's friend's son kind of kid. Could he have Antisocial Personality Disorder? (Hell Cinema) - Oh, I'm sorry. Are you okay? - I'm okay. Okay. What? You want me to invest in the movie? Shouldn't you tell me when she went abroad? You jerk. When will she come back? I don't know. So till tomorrow morning, she won't be in Korea, right? You want me to go to the club again? I told you I quit. You'd better say fish do not live in the water anymore. If I get caught again, the wedding will become my funeral. Even if it's a cremation, you still have to go. Hello, Sir. There is a car exhibition today, those model girls already booked the place, you bastard. You are such a... It's no different than the men's bathroom. Why only five of them are girls? They really booked here, but were taken by the other clubs. Those bastards! Sorry, dude. Staying a little longer, you would see the differences. I'll put my hands together and pray for it to happen. Why do I suddenly have the urge to go hunting today? - What are you doing? - Have a few glasses, then go home. What's the point of coming just to drink? Why don't you go to the sidewalk shop and drink there? Hey, stay for the next round, no, stay until the extra time. - Look alive! - Why aren't you excited like this when you do a movie, bastard? Drink up. What? What happened? Video call. (Video call - Sun-ae) It's Sun-ae? Wait... what to do? Toilet... Convenience store! (Missed call - Sun-ae) (Calling - Sun-ae) (Calling video call - Sun-ae) (Video call - Sun-ae) Sir, it's me, Ji-ho. Today, I understood your "Spare the rod, spoil the child" lesson. I sent you a small gift as a thank you. This kid. (Ahn Ji-ho's gift, Send Thank you Card Combo Thank U, Donut + Americano) Hello! What are you doing? Why don't you go inside? Come, we have waited for a while. Come in. You can sit anywhere. What is this? Do you go to the gym? Your arms are really firm. Who is this? Sang-bom can't bring good stuff like her. - Or gold digger? - This is for you. This is for us. Cheers. Drink up. I have a bad feeling. If so, I absolutely won't drink. But... who are you guys? Where is this? VIP room. Then who are we? VIP! Shall I pour you some wine? We go all the way today! I have to leave here before the video calls come again. - Or else, - Come on. - The wedding and my sweet life... - Well, start! Hey, drink up. Will vanish into smoke. Go on! Drink up! Drink up! Put it in. Quickly drink. Yoo-bin! Do Yoo-bin! Why are you this drunk? Let me take off your shoes. Lift your feet up. That's right. Look at me. Wait, hold on. What do I do? Hey. Look alive. Do you know who I am? Let's see. Well. Take this off. Raise your head. That's right. Hand, hand. Take off your pants? Again, lift your butt. Lift your hand. Let's see. Loosen up your fingers. Here you are. It's done. What is this? His girlfriend is pretty, right? Right? Is he looking at us? Hey, he was three sheets to the wind. Don't worry, he won't remember anything. Hey, look here. Look alive. Woof woof. Try barking? Bark? Woof woof. Woof woof, try saying woof woof for me. Woof woof. Quick, bark, please. Bark, please. Woof woof. Woof. Woof woof. Woof. (The Distributors) What is this? My phone. Where is my phone? Hivi. Hivi. Hey body! Hey body! (Woof woof woof) I'll get crazy. Oh my. Do Yoo-bin. Please open the door. Yeah, honey, wait a minute. Oh, it's you. It's really you. Hmm... your whole body smells of guilt. What guilt? I may disobey the law, but I can't live without you. Really? Alright. Darling. You said you'll come back tomorrow, why didn't you tell me... Why didn't I tell you? Since I departed in Italy until I arrived in South Korea, I kept calling you like a stalker. Explain yourself. Why can't I call you in this 5G era? I lost my phone. Lost your phone? Why did you lose your phone when I was not in Korea, when you could play tricks behind my back? Would you believe me if I said that? Of course, I would believe you. Even with a knife on my neck, I would believe you. What is it again? Why does it smell like cheap perfume? I was too drunk yesterday, Sang-bom carried me back, so it must be clung to me. You remember? You always say Sang-bom smells like cheap perfume. But why is Sang-bom not here? What? Normally, if you two get drunk like that, the next morning you guys would go sober up together. Didn't you guys normally do that? Yeah, we meant to do that, but he said he had an emergency... Speaking of emergency, I suddenly want to go to the bathroom. Use the bathroom inside. Why? Sang-bom "terrorized" the toilet. (There are people in the car with the intermittent explosive disorder) Damn. Please come in. Oh, you came? You bastard have no sentiment. How did I get home yesterday? Why are you asking me, you are the one who disappeared without a word? Didn't you come back with the other two? Looks like they took me home, but I don't remember anything, my phone is also gone. Your phone got stolen? I have a bad feeling. I called, but the phone was turned off. If she used my fingerprint to open my phone while I was sleeping… I'll use another phone to see. (Information in the device has been initialized) Alright. It's done. Really? It's initialized remotely, even if you unlock it, there is nothing inside. Even if Steve Jobs came back to life, he couldn't get it back either. Okay? But... is the car out there yours? I just bought it. You crazy guy. You haven't paid me off yet, but you dare to buy an imported car? I bought it to repay you! I have to use it to be noticed by investors. The car was flooded before, even if you sold it, you wouldn't be able to buy your tires. If you don't believe me, take the car. Why are you so harsh? You jerk. Hey. Anyway, let's go eat hangover soup. What? What? Just say what you want. It's just... you said your father-in-law objected because your family was poor? If Sun-ae didn't care about her life on a hunger strike, he wouldn't let you two get married. So? What do you mean? Could it be... the girl last night was hired by your father-in-law? Why? To break up the unsuitable marriage. It can't be. Does he run a slot machine business in Japan? What does a person like that not dare to do? It's the kind of tea used to serve distinguished guests. The scent is very elegant, how should I say it? Oh, I have good news for you, Yoo-bin. Is the decision out? The film department will be established this year. Although there were still some objections from the directors, the chairman stood by his decision. Thank you, Dad. Thank you, Sir. If you weren't Sung-min's homeroom teacher, I would have arranged you into the faculty's management board. Please help him until the college entrance exam. Yes, please don't worry. I will keep an eye on him. Congratulations on becoming both a groom and a professor. What? Why? (Unknown number) (Unknown number) Take the call. Yeah? Take it. Oh yeah. Hello? Do Yoo-bin, listen carefully to what I'm about to say. Go to the restroom immediately. You will reveal the feeling in front of your fiancée. What's wrong? Is something wrong? Oh, it's the department head, Kim Mi-young. Is there something wrong at school? Nothing, I'm talking about phone scams. Excuse me. I'll go to the bathroom. Sung-min, show him the way. You do it. Hey. Follow me. Excuse me. Sung-min, are you outside? What happened? My stomach hurts so much. If you don't mind, please go somewhere else. Oh! Feel free to go! Thank you. Hello. Prepare 33 million won in 50,000 won bill by 6 on Wednesday. - Who the hell are you? - Someone who knows all about you. If you call the police, I will reveal to the world your private hobby. I will inform the location at the most suitable time. Hello? (An unread message) (Limit to display number) Look here, open your eyes. Please bark. Woof woof, bark. Woof woof. Woof woof. If Sun-ae knows, it's over. Is there no other way? Hey, there is no way, call the police. If I call the police, and that guy puts the video up… Hey, how about telling the truth to your father-in-law? He used to be a part of Yakuza. Then I'll be killed first, like the Yakuza. Then my dear friend almost died. Anyway, are you sure she stole it? They even accessed the black box and CCTV. But... why are they targeting me? Why else? Does your SNS look like a high school teacher? You are like a rich man. I'm so jealous, you met a rich wife, you could change your house and car. Isn't that even weirder? What? Why 33 million? Not 330 million. Make sense. Sure enough, someone had been following you all along, seeing that you were about to marry the daughter of a pro-Japanese family, so they want to interfere? Who would that be? How do I know that? Only you know. Are there any suspicious girls? Sang-bom. Do you remember Ga-young? Jung Ga-young? What is it about her? Compensation fee seven years ago. Me 30 million, you 3 million. Could it be... She also has the motive to get revenge on me. She wants me to experience what she has to go through. But it's been seven years, why choose now to take revenge? Because... I'm getting married. (Legal Entity Detective Ilmok) Name. Her name is Jung Ga-young. She might be using a nickname. 30 years old... or 31? Do you have a picture? No, the pictures on the internet are also deleted. Phone number? We only trace through phone numbers. But it's a fake number. Then... the school she attended? I only know that she attended high school in Incheon. No photos, no SNS, she uses nickname. It's tough. It's indeed tough. Seven years ago, she reported my friend and me to the police. Is that useful enough? The groom saw his fiancée so beautiful that he was shocked. I already went to the Italian store to see it. The wood color is darker than shown in the picture. So if we want to coordinate with the bedroom interior color tone... Do Yoo-bin! Wake up! Yeah, what happened? You do know that in order to marry you, I have to fight against my father, right? If you let me down before the wedding day... I'm not gonna let you down. So don't worry. What is it? (Limited display of incoming calls) Limited display of incoming calls? Just hang up. It's all spam, don't take it. Hello? Yeah? Hello? Who is this? What did they say? Donate old things behind the villa. Prepare 33 million won in 50,000 won bill by 6 on Wednesday. I will inform the location at the most suitable time. (Collect old clothes) The north, south, east, and west roofs are all installed with cameras, including the back of the villa. If you want to avoid camera's view, escape through a hole in the ground. You worked hard. It's been a while since I experienced working in the field again. We only played for one night, and we ended up in this goddamn situation. Isn't this a lot like the Hitchcock movie? This is Hitchcock movie to you? This is my life-or-death situation, you bastard. What is this? Really? Don't be scared, only gas gun. What if Jung Ga-young really came? What else? We have to watch till the end to know! - Hello. - Oh, you scared me. Oh, Ji-ho, what are you doing here? I live here. Really? Did you come to meet my parents? Because of last time incident. No, what happened last time was a secret between two of us. I came here to see a friend. How are you doing, buddy? My friend just came back from America, we are talking. Just go home, see you tomorrow. Okay. - Goodbye. - Bye, see you. What happened last time? Just a few things. Damn. Stand there, don't move. Raise your hand! What are you doing? Who sent you here? Damn, who's behind? - Hey! - What is it? - Do Yoo-bin! - What? This... Hey, the kid talking to you earlier, can you trust him? And the fact he lives behind the villa. He even recognized you in the car and started a conversation with you. He will be a Seoul student in the future. There are boys from Seoul University stealing from people. You think going to Seoul University makes you a bad guy? No, it's the bad guys who want to go to Seoul University. Anyway, the way to keep out of the camera, there is only one way. Going to a place where there is no camera and giving the money. Damn, are you doubting me? Lately, you haven't borrowed money from me. Show me the trunk of your car. Yeah, check it out, just check everything. Also, I will sell the organs and return the money to you. Don't ever show up in front of me again, damn you. It's crazy. Hello? Prepare 33 million won immediately. This time, you transfer Bitcoin. What the hell are you saying? I prepared the money, let's meet and talk. Let's meet. I'll call you next Thursday. You... You are Ga-young, right? Jung Ga-young? Answer me! Hey! Hey! Min-ji, what's wrong? I have something to say. Tell me. Not here, somewhere with few people. How could you do that? I didn't mean to show it to anyone. My computer broke down, so I gave Sang-bom to fix it. Either way, he didn't expect it to be spread. I requested deletion on some websites. They will disappear soon, don't worry. If the videos show your face, can you be calm? Actually, I also want to go crazy. I'd rather it be my face… Anyway, I'm sorry. I apologize to you. First, Sang-bom and I gathered all our money. Ga-young, let's… let's settle this a bit more humanely. What's wrong with you? What do you want? You think it's humane to solve problems with money? So… what should I do? It's not like I forced you to film, nor did I intentionally upload it online, what do you want me to do? Whatever you want, just say it, I'll do it all. Did you do it on purpose? What? Gong Sang-bom knows this video will make money, so he purposely wanted to fix your computer. Because I broke up with you, so you wanted to take revenge on me. You wanted to destroy my life. I told you not, really! Why couldn't you believe me? It didn't matter anymore! Whatever the reason, because of what you did, my life was ruined. I would make you pay everything back. No, the humiliation that I have to endure, the feeling of being afraid of people's looks is like hell, I will make you taste it little by little. Sir. Sir. Ji-ho. See me for a while. Ji-ho, let's go to the cafeteria. Oh, hello Miss. Because of what you did, my life was ruined. I would make you pay everything back. We found her, Jung Ga-young. Did you really find Ga-young? Come over here first, I'll text you the address. What is this? Why is Jung Ga-young here? I don't know, you go ask her. So you are being threatened and you think it's me? Only you know about the deal that Sang-bom and I gave you. Your motives are clear. Get revenge on me. Revenge? Yeah. I want to take revenge on you like crazy. But... even if you die, my video won't go away. Even if you and I die together, there is still someone watching that video. If you are going to be pitiful about losing your job and having your marriage annulled, then just die. What's the point of seeing me? I also want to believe that you didn't do it, but no matter how many times I think about it, you are the only one who is suspicious. As long as you delete that video, I will bypass everything. Could it be... you also filmed a video with your fiancée? You… You are still an asshole, after all. What are you doing here? Has the guest arrived? What? Who is this? Is he that bastard? You asshole, you come at the right time. There are many beautiful sunny places here. Hey. I'll kill this asshole, don't stop me. Stop it. (Incoming call Sun-ae) Why can't I call you all day long? I'm sorry, I'm a bit busy. What happened to your voice? Is something wrong? Dear, hello? (Tae Woon Police Department) Prepare 33 million won in 50,00 won bill by 6 on Wednesday. - Who the hell are you? - Someone who knows all about you. If you call the police, I will reveal to the world your private hobby. I will inform the location at the most suitable time. So, you gave him money? Yes, and this Thursday, he asked for another 33 million won. But what hobby is he talking about? Probably the video I filmed with my fiancée. Excuse me. But did your fiancée agree to shoot that video? Huh? Without the consent of the other party, you can be fined according to the provision of the law on sexual exploitation and abuse. I filmed it with the consent of both. I only asked to confirm. The case has been received, please cooperate. Detective, can you do me a favor? The fact that I was threatened, please don't tell my fiancée. There is one more month till our wedding. Hello, how can I help you? I want to learn about the phone number that does not show on my phone. We are sorry, but we can't tell you. Why? Why can't you? You have to report to the police and submit proof of your damage. You think Yoo-bin has an affair? After I came back from Europe, he's behaved strangely. It's weird that the girl who has an affair with your fiancé called and said, "Donate old things behind the villa." Make sense… You came there and saw nothing, didn't you? Maybe they called the wrong number. I think you have pre-marital stress. It'd be gone after the wedding. Can you be honest with me? What happened in Recording Room with Mr. Do Yoo-bin? Is it related to the phone? No, it isn't. Ji-ho, it's not that I'm scolding you, but I'm helping you... before a more serious problem comes. Sweetie, feel like eating fruit? I'm going to sleep now. Ah, are you? Has the mock test result come out? It will, tomorrow. I see. Sweet dreams, dear. (Unknown user - Just now. Reply in 10 seconds or the bomb explodes) (Unknown user - Just now 10) The results of last month's mock exam are out. For 12th-grade homeroom teachers, you guys make a list of students who are likely to get into universities in Seoul, based on past mock tests results and academic records. Mr. Do Yoo-bin hasn't gone to work yet? (Precise and meticulous convenience-store-half-price delivery. (Half-price delivery collecting point) (Receiver) I have no idea. I'm not sure, either. "I'm not sure either" means you really don't know, or you know who she is but don't want to get involved? Can I watch the CCTV footage of that day? You know, without any warrants, I can't. You think it's nothing because I talk gently, right? Or should I call all the anti-narcotics teams, sexual violence investigators, and the officer in charge of the county office, tax department, and fire station right now? You guys pissed me off. According to internal rules, the hard drive will be erased and rebooted every three days, so there's no footage of that day, we're so sorry. The picture that you gave was immediately sent to our chat room. Once we find her, we'll be in contact right away. We'll contact you right away. Miss. Miss. Yeah? Can I go to the bathroom for a moment? Sure. Why did you mention December 18, 2018? I tried searching, it turned out on that day, penalties for illegal filming were increased. So what? There are illegal pictures or videos on Ahn Ji-ho's cellphone, right? Please answer me, is it true? That's why you punished him, right? Miss Sang-hee, if it is illegal filming, are you going to ruin a student's bright future because of that? Huh? Mr. Do Yoo-bin, you have made three mistakes. First, you punished students by trampling on their human rights. Second, you abused your power to cover up issues that are supposed to give to the disciplinary committee. Third, you instilled in that child the wrong idea that men are allowed to commit such a great crime. Yes, I admit that I was wrong. I was wrong, indeed. But, can you bypass Ji-ho, regarding the disciplinary committee? Please forgive Ahn Ji-ho just once, I beg of you. What if illegal filming gets spread on SNS or the internet? Time goes by and if these are discovered later, how are you going to handle the damage? This problem can't be prevented by burying it. To avoid further damage, they must follow the rules. Miss Lee. If following the rules, Ahn Ji-ho won't be able to attend university. Isn't that Ahn Ji-ho? He is. What's wrong? Everyone, back to your seats. Back to your seats. Hey, Ahn Ji-ho. Ji-ho. Ji-ho, Ahn Ji-ho. Hey, go inside, to your classrooms. Close all the windows. Go inside quickly. Quickly go inside. Call 119. Fortunately, the critical condition is over. How come you, the homeroom teacher, didn't know this? Something is wrong, right? Hasn't there been any sign all along? A student fell from 1st to 50th place in the entire school rank. Mr. Do, did you really know nothing? I'm sorry. Yes, Mr. Principal, I'm listening. The surgery ended very well. His parents… Did the surgery end well? Ji-ho, is he okay? (Cyber investigation team Detective Yoon) Please drink these, you guys. Thank you. But they say it's untraceable if you transfer Bitcoin. Is that true? No, it all can be traced. It turned out it could be. But it's over midnight now, and still no call. Didn't that person know the police were here? Hypothetically. Hello. Hello. You must tell me the wallet address, so I can transfer the money. Do Yoo-bin, why are your enemies on all sides? Hey, you have to live properly. Woof woof woof. Hello. Hello. How is the taste of being deceived? That doesn't feel good, right? Tell me the address, so I can transfer the money. You're not listening. Huh? The game was over, you bastard. Location detected. Don't be so worried. We can identify the suspect by tracing the access history. You told me not to worry? Didn't you listen just now? He said the game was over. It's just a strategy to increase bargaining power. He will call again soon. Let's talk for a while. Is there anything you're still hiding from me? What is that? The question, "How does it feel to be in that situation?" Doesn't seem like an out-of-nowhere one. Can you guess what it has to do with? I can't. Is there something that bothers you? Suddenly, I'm curious about Do Yoo-bin. I wonder what kind of life he's had. (Hansul Yesul High School) While watching "Regarding the Pain of Others" by Susan Sontag, one question popped up. The picture describes the pain and hell that those little kids weren't strong enough to deal with, who has the right to see it? People who spend money to go to exhibitions? No. The author said that pictures like this could prevent the war and those who can handle the pain of those kids have the right to see it. For others, they just watch to please their eyes. The game was over. You bastard. Six, nine, six… The game was over? Change it next week. That's it for today. Yes. You worked hard. Excuse me. Are you Im Sun-ae? Who are you? Someone had me send this to you. What is that? They said you would know when you opened it. In short, I already passed it to you. Hey... Wait. Who are you? The mistress sent us here. Please follow us. What? Wait a second. Why? Oh! Hold one. Stay put there! Hey! Stop there! Hey. Stop! Stop there. Hey! I watched a video today. Some crazy guy was being filmed nude, no matter how I watched, he was still the guy who was going to marry my daughter. I'll go straight to the point. Answer me honestly. Yes, I will. During the time Sun-ae was in Europe, you bring home some girls, right? Dad, that… Throw him down. Dad! Wait a second. Please forgive me. You brought some girls home, didn't you? I did. I was wrong. Please forgive me. Then that girl asked for money and you didn't give her money. No. I gave her as requested. But she didn't keep her promise. Please trust me. How would the situation change if I trusted you? Please spare my life. Please spare my life. I'll ask the last question. Besides the video I watched, is there any other video footage? I mean, is there any video with Sun-ae in it? There isn't. That's all. Only that video. Please spare my life. Yeah. Next month, I'll leave for America. You just let that person go. Search all the possible places for videos. I'll tell you as an evangelist. There are hundreds or thousands of illegal chat rooms on the social network. Either do I have to pay to join there, or do I have to share illegal videos. Even if I found the video, I have no idea who released it and the places he posted it. The only way to do... is to report it to the police. I reported, what else to report now? You think it's a scientific investigation like in the movies? There is no result at all. If the video that was filmed with Sun-ae got spread out one day, it would be the day I die. I'll die for sure. No need to worry about other things, just find the first distributor. It doesn't matter how much it costs. As long as we catch that guy. I will drag him to hell. If the video with Sun-ae in it got released, your parents would not be able to see their son even when they die. Look, it's beautiful. I said it was beautiful. Yeah. I looked up Do Yoo Bin's profile, one interesting thing. He was accused seven years ago of secret filming. (Do Yoo-bin, Result: Use candid cameras, violate the law of sexual violence) Quitting order from the above? I heard that you already paid for the surgery and treatment? Isn't it irresponsible to just leave your job? Irresponsible? So how responsible should I be? Ji-ho becomes like this not because of his performance. You want to investigate the truth of the matter? Ji-ho's parents may lose their only son. And you want to meet and tell them that their son got caught because of secret filming. You want to force a person standing on a cliff to the edge of the abyss? Is this the principle and justice you mention? Don't you have any sympathy? So... what is the principle and justice that you think of? If Ji-ho hadn't been a 1st-place student in the school, would you have just given that punishment on that day? Did I say I punished him? The places those illegal videos were posted to, to whom they sent, have you checked them thoroughly? I deleted all pictures right there. It's not just about deleting. Have you checked the website login history and SNS message? You haven't checked those yet? A few days ago, I received a text from Ji-ho. It's an automated message that he set up before the suicide. He said he wanted to be a director like Hitchcock, and... regarding the hidden videos, he would take responsibility for what he caused. As you said, we can't do that to Ji-ho's parents. I know... we have to check Ji-ho's phone and computer (Unknown number) To prevent hidden videos from being spread out. I know it'd be hard for you… Mr. Yoo-bin! Hello? It's like living in hell, right? Who are you? Who are you, bastard? Don't be too worked up. Your real hell has just begun. Woof woof woof. Hello? (Business Massage) Hey! Do you know this woman? What is that? I ask again, do you know this woman? We aren't her manager, we just captured this photo from a live-stream. You captured it, don't you remember? I can recognize her face, but what is her nickname? Oh, Buing Buing fox. - Hurry up, I'm tired. - It's live. Quickly drink, drink it up. Drink it up with Buing. "Spank me" sent 2,500 star candies. Oh, Henry is watching too. - It's his first time watching, isn't it? - Hello. "Golden spoon" sent 5,000 star candies. - Give us 10,000. - "What to do today" sent 1,000. "Henry" sent 33,000 star candies. 33,000? Who are you? Is that you, Henry? What's wrong with you? - Henry. - Do you want something? What do you feel like doing? I can do everything as long as not breaking the law. - I love you. - Thank you. Thank you. What do you want me to do? - Let me dance for you. - I love you. Thank you. I love you. You're the best. What time is it? It's been 30 minutes already? Maybe he won't show up? If so, it would be better. What a loser, we'll go home in ten minutes. What if he asks to return the candies after we leave? How can he? We are on time, he is the one who didn't show up. Make sense. Sha ba doo... You're crazy. Where do we go now? What is that? My neck. Uncle, didn't you see the red light? Are you drunk? Get out. Come here. I told you to get out. Is something wrong with your eyes? Do you recognize me? Who are you? Turn off your phone. Is it a crime to receive star candies? I didn't ask for them. I'm just here with my friend as company. Please forgive us. You truly didn't remember anything? Last Friday of last month. Havana Club VIP room. You remember now, right? You came to my house that night, right? We did come, but I just filmed you as requested. I didn't do anything. Me neither. I just acted as an intermediary to introduce Da-eun. Introduced to whom? What is his name again? Hitchcock, Hitchcock. Your friend who came with you that night, who was a director. Is it possible that the girl last night was hired by her father-in-law? It's over midnight now, but still no call. Didn't that person know the police were here? Damn, are you doubting me? What are you doing? What else can I do now? Doing what you asked for. Hey, the juniors are asking for more money. Just give them, no need to argue about. Where are you? Of course, I'm at home, you bastard. I'm coming. Yoo-bin, it's true that I took your phone and your money. But I didn't call to blackmail you. I didn't send the video to Sun-ae. Are you going to keep lying to me? It's true! At first, I also thought it was Jung Ga-young. I was tricking you, then she came in the middle. If it weren't Jung Ga-young, which bastard know about the compensation of 33 million won? You are going to be crafty now? Where is your phone? Of course, it's at home to be an alibi. So check if your phone got hacked. Someone can see the agreement on cloud storage by hacking your phone. Otherwise, it cannot be explained. Shut up and answer my questions. The video with Sun-ae in, did you post it? Give me a cigarette. Answer me first. Give me a cigarette first. Yoo-bin. You goddamn bastard. Why don't you trust me? You bastard. Are you going to kill me for real? Answer me, you bastard. If the video with Sun-ae in was posted, would you kill if you were me? You were the one who posted the video with Ga-young in, you son of a bitch. The coffee coupon that you received was set up with hacking software. As well as the video sent to your new phone. Do you trust me now? I just took your phone and swapped your money. That guy did the rest. You're going to jail anyway, you bastard. Okay, I'll turn myself in and go to jail. I will live like a sinner for the rest of my life. I ask you only one question. Coffee coupons with hacking software is from the boy living behind the villa, right? The boy going to attend Seoul University? Then I'm certain. He is Keyser Söze... in The Usual Suspects. If Ahn Ji-ho were the culprit, then who threatened me after Ji-ho was hospitalized? That's the real culprit! But why did Ji-ho jump down? Why? Sir, you came. I'm sorry, but can I have a look at Ji-ho's phone? Ji-ho's father is finding it too. But it can't be found either in school or at home. Lately, he'd also been texting someone in a hurry, we also doubt that he was hiding something. We were going to check it too. Texting? Besides me, is anyone else looking for Ji-ho's phone? Yes. Why do you ask? Who is that? Why don't you delete the hacking software? You were eavesdropped. Last time, I was because I wasn't aware of it. This time, I intentionally leave it there because I know now. You stay here, I'm going to meet Jung Ga-young. Yes. (Public phone number) Hello? This is Do Yoo-bin, please do me a favor. Which favor? This bastard! Gong Sang-bom. Why? What? Let's film an episode for the last time. To Hitchcock. (Miss Lee Sang-hee) This is Do Yoo-bin. I have something to ask you. Before jumping down, Ahn Ji-ho sent you a message, right? Yes, he said he wanted to be like director Hitchcock. He asked me to help him. Was that the last message from Ji-ho? It was. What's wrong? I'm finding Ji-ho's phone. The last message he sent contained a cue. 688 H5. What are you talking about? 688 H5. If that guy is also looking for Ji-ho's phone, he is trapping me. Are you finding this? Ji-ho's mother told me. You're also looking for Ji-ho's phone. Not only is there evidence that you asked Ji-ho to secretly film, but also evidence to entice accomplices to threaten me. Why did you do that? Answer me, son of a bitch. Why? It's interesting. I'm not a god anyway, but he did whatever I told him. This is way more interesting than phone games. Also… You are the most famous of the slaves listed in my chat room. Since I started threatening, I publicly informed your every move. Until the day you went to the cemetery to find Jung Ga-young. Wow, that's amazing, I got a lot of Super Chats that day. Why did you do that to Ji-ho? Because I don't like him. Teachers keep mentioning him as some Seoul University student, so I want to ruin his life. I told him to pretend to be a girl and masturbate right in the chat room. And that crazy jerk followed every order. Do all Seoul University guys act like that? What makes you go this far? What else? I told you it was interesting. Also, why are you pretending to be naive? You're no different from me, given what happened to Jung Ga-young. All members. Now it's time to punish the teacher. Let's start Fight Money now. Don't be scared. I won't kill you. (Wow, education? User 148 donated to you) (Is he really a teacher?) (This isn't a setup, is it?) (Educating teachers even? Why just the sound, no video?) (Turn on the lights, please! Turn on the lights) (Wait until your mother drags you home. Will you denounce them?) (Show your face, then fight. Take some photos as a souvenir) (Will you do livestream after going to the police station?) (Sender: Ahn Ji-ho. Postal code: 2361812 (Delivery to: Happy 25 Songcheon branch) What will the police say? Huh? Outraged at being annulled by his fiancée, a guy called her brother out and planned to kill him. Unexpectedly, the brother is good at fighting, so the guy was beaten to death. That sounds interesting. For your information, the marshal is here. He still receives pocket money from my dad in his fifties. You didn't know that, right? Members, today's live is over. Sung-min. That phone is not Ji Ho's phone. Ahn Ji-ho's phone isn't here. Bullshit. (Limit to display number) Little brat. Look up at the ceiling, see many cameras? What you confessed was sent directly to the police. You're done now, you bastard! Damn. At the high school in Yanghyeon-go, Seoul, the case of a 3rd-year student jumping off has been elucidated to be as a result of cyber-violence by a classmate. The incident made everyone even more terrified. The culprit, via an online chat room, he asked the victim to take a video of sexual exploitation and threatened to post it online. Take it slowly. - Are you okay? - Yes. If it hadn't been me, but you had discovered Ji-ho's video, it wouldn't have been this worse. It's all thanks to you. (Seoul Detention Center) (Visitor registration) (Full name: Do Yoo-bin Relationship: Teacher) (Relationship) Sir. You came! Are your legs still okay? Anyway, my family lawyer is coming here soon. Haven't you heard anything? It's a petition, if you write it, my sentence can be reduced. It wasn't like I told Ji-ho to die. You understand, right? Let's... Let's settle this a bit more humanely. Ga-young, let's… let's settle this a bit humanely. (The Distributors)
