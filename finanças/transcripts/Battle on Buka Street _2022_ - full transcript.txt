[female narrator] Welcome to Buka street. The food head-quarters of Otanwa community. Where you can get different delicacies of - any tribe in Nigeria. - [drumbeats] [market chatter, sizzling] - My customer! - [market chatter continues] [female voice] The boss has arrived. - Customer come! - [market chatter in background] Customer! Eh? Customer! [in Pidgin] Come, ah! Where are you going? Come and buy from me! There is eba, there is ogbono soup! Please leave me! You don't put pepper in your food! May pepper be the end of you! [in English] Buka street is where I, Yejide, [in Yoruba] cook so good that you'll lick your plate. Iya Ade the amala seller [in English] owns the biggest and best buka. - [in Yoruba] Do you want ewedu or gbegiri? - Ewedu. [Yejide] Wait. Wait. Before I continue my story, Let me take you back to the very beginning now. A normal family consists of the parents and their children. And they're supposed to have so much love, peace and harmony. Just like this family! And this is my own family. My father, Mazi Kanayo Maduka. Always eats. [in Yoruba] He's always about food. [in English] One of his major weaknesses! -[in Igbo] My husband, -Hey, hey! [in English] stop eating now. Do you want to spoil this picture? And this is my ever troublesome attention-seeking step-mother. [in Yoruba] Ezinne, the troublesome woman. [man in English] Where is this woman now? - Asake! - Eh! - My husband, I'm here! I'm here. - I'm coming oh! My husband! Come! - [licks fingers] - [Ezinne hisses] [plates clinking] [in English] And here comes my mother. [in Yoruba] My mother. Asake. The one whose wealth causes envy. Stunning beauty. [in English] So beautiful. [Asaka hisses loudly] I'm sure you all are wondering where Yejide is. Right? That's me inside my mother's womb. I'm yet to be born. [chuckles softly] - Eh, where are your children? - [Asake scoffs] - [husband] Where are your children? - [Ezinne] Where are those boys? - [Asake] Children! Come on! - [Maduka] Calm down! - We're ready oh! - [Ezinne hisses loudly] [Maduka in Igbo] Ehen! Yes come! Daddy's lookalike! [giggles] [in English] My children. - Are you ready, sir? - Eh? [smacks lips] Yes we're ready. [winds camera] Children say cheese. - Cheese. - [Yedije] Are you seeing this? Trouble family. From these pictures, you now know the kind of family I come from [Maduka laughing] [groans] Hmmm! Here comes my father again. Mazi Maduka Kanayo. The least spare part seller in Otanwa, my papa, just married another wife. [laughing] As long as you're beautiful, and you can cook very well, my father will marry you! [in Yoruba] Continue! [laughing] Hmm. [in English] And this didn't go down well with my mother. [in Yoruba] Asake, my mother. But for Ezinne, the troublesome woman, [in English] this calls for celebration from Ezinne's camp. Because she wants another woman [in Yoruba] to overthrow my mother. Right? [laughing] My husband welcome. - How are you? - I'm fine. [Ezinne] Welcome. Eh? - [grunts] Take it easy. - [mocking tone] [in English] It is good for you. [in Igbo] When one marries a new wife, he gets rid of the old one. [in English] You can talk, right? Let me see you talk again. [snickering, screams] [in Igbo] My God! [groans in pain] - [Ezinne screaming] - Mother! Mother! [in English] Go and call your father. - Papa! - [Maduka] What is it? No, doctor! You cannot perform CS on my wife! - For what reason? - Mr Maduka, that's what the patient wants. And her EDD is close. [in Igbo] What EDD? [in English] Her expected date of delivery - is around the corner. - [hisses] She has consented. We can do it. Doctor, what rubbish consent? - Asake. - [in Yoruba] Look, look my husband, [in English] that's what I want. I want to give birth to my child today. - But Ezinne... Ezinne... - And so? [hisses loudly] [hisses] Ha! [screaming] - You're almost there. - [panting] Madam push now! I will not push until I see my husband! He-he-he! Look at her! Attention seeker! [in Yoruba] Ezinne the liar! Push! Lazy woman! [in English] Just because she wants my father's attention. Because you know he will be all out for my mother today, right? [yelling] I said I want to see my husband! Please hurry up. Fast. Mr. Maduka! Please come back. - Your wife, Asake, is not cooperating. - Okay. - Mr. Maduka? - Yes? I called you because your other wife, Ezinne, has refused to push until she sees you. - Yes. Okay. - Please let's get going. - Mr. Maduka! - Yes - [Asake screaming] - [Ezinne screaming] - [clapping] Please come! - Maduka! - Maduka! - Maduka! [Maduka screaming] [Ezinne in Igbo] I'm dead! - [Nurse] Mr. Maduka. - [Asake and Ezinne screaming] Finally, I, Yejide Adufe Njideka Maduka arrived. [baby cooing] [Yejide mimics baby, sniggers] But on the same day with my ugly, annoying, disgusting, step-sister. Awele. [hisses then scoffs] [babies cooing] I hated her so much already. Just the thought of her beside me, made me start crying instantly! [baby cries] And the jealous Awele, just like her mother, started crying annoyingly. So that her voice can over-shadow mine. - [in Yoruba] Never! - [babies crying] Huh! That day... [distorted voice] a new battle was born. [market chatter] [Yejide] Yes, things are going all fine for my mother and I. [in Yoruba] Asake, the great cook. [in English] The Queen of amala in Otanwa community. Look at them. [hisses strongly] Awele and her mother, Ezinne, with their tasteless ofe-akwu. We battle them! - [in Yoruba] Sell amala to me. - Give me food! - What is it? - [Pidgin] Leave here. What is it? Please calm down, there's no food! Give me! [in Pidgin] There's something wrong with you! - [Ezinne in Igbo] Come! Come! - [in Yoruba] You need to be patient! - [in Igbo] Come! - [commotion in background] [in Yoruba] I've told you, you need to be patient! Why are you doing this to a customer? - Mummy! - Yes, what is it? - Mummy, look! - Where? What is it? Take food there! [Asake] Mummy Micheal, come and serve! - [Yejide] What?! - What are you waiting for? - [Awele screaming] - [female voice] What are you doing? - No! - [female voice] My God! My God! - [Ezinne yells] Hey! - [Asake] Bastard! - [voice in crowd] Hey stop! - [Asake] Ehn? - It's a lie! - Sell this food! [commotion] [in English] Hey stop! Despite my father's shouting and how much he tried to separate us, even with the crowd around, the fight continued. Anyway, my father, Mazi Maduka Kanayo was reaping a hundred fold of what he sowed. [sigh] - Hey... - [in Yoruba] When did you come in? [in English] Oh my in-laws, you're welcome. You're welcome. - Ah-ah, Lanchili, You're welcome. - Yes sir. It's Olanshile. Look at this one. You want to teach me how to pronounce Yoruba. - [Lanshile laughs] - Ehn? I started pronouncing Yoruba language before you were born. [chuckles] Sir, the Lanchili is fine sir. [in Igbo] It's all the same. [all laughing] [in English] That was why I was able to marry your mother. - I like Yoruba women. - We can see. - In fact, I even like their food more. - [Ezinne singing] My husband She cooks fantastically. [chuckles] My husband. Hey. My husband - Mummy. - Yes? - [in Igbo] Is everything okay? - Everything is great! My husband Ehen, Chukwuemeka is here. - [man laughs] Yes. - [Mr. Maduka] Chukwuemeka? [in English] Yes. He has come to tell us his intentions concerning eeh, [in Igbo] our daughter. Our Ijeawele. [in Igbo] Hello Sir, I greet you. [in English] I can't see your face. - Why is your cap covering your face? - Take off the cap okay? - [in Igbo] Sir, it's the fashion. - [Ezinne cackles] I'm a typical fashion junkie. [laughs] [in Igbo] Can you see his chest? [laughs] - Is he a boxer or what? - [in Igbo] He's a drummer. [Chukwuemeka] Yes, part time. [Chuckles] - Thank you. - Which part time? - Sir, drink. - [Yejide] Ignore them. [Yejide in English] I guess you're as shocked as we are. Wait, the biggest shock is coming. - It will be well with you. Hmm? - Amen. - God will continue to help you. - Amen. Wherever you go, you shall make peace. - Amen! - Eh? Now go and show us that person who has taken your heart. - Thank you, Papa. - [Mr. Maduka laughs] [in Yoruba] Toyin and her mother are here. [in English] Hey! Go and bring them in. Oh! Are you people seeing what I'm seeing? Awele and her conniving mother. They made sure she got married on the same day Lanshile and I got married. - [Ezinne in Igbo] What is it again? - My husband, come. Your children... [crowd clapping, cheering] [Mr. Maduka] Hold on let me see... Hold on let me finish... [in Igbo] I greet you all! Welcome! - Okay children! - Ehen! - Eh... - Yes. [in English] It shall be well with you. - Amen. - Eh... [in Yoruba] Eh? Where is your father? [Mr. Maduka praying in Igbo] - [in Yoruba] Look. - Who? - Amen. - [exclaims] [in Yoruba] She played a fast one on me. [in English] Yes, wherever you go, God will continue to bless you. - [crowd] Amen! - Ehn? - Whatever you put... - [in Yoruba] My husband. - Amen! - [tense music playing] - I don't like what is happening. - Calm down. - I don't like what is happening at all! - [Ezinne laughs in disbelief] My daughter picked today before they jumped on it. - [Ezinne exclaims] - I don't like it oh! - [in Igbo] Look at this woman! - [Asake in Yoruba] Okay let's go. - Go where? - Don't be annoyed. - What is the meaning of all this? - This woman, you're looking for trouble! [mimics her] You too... - Look at this woman! - [music intensifies] And that is how my father got entangled, as usual. Moving left, right, front, back... He didn't know where to settle down. And my mother and I [in Yoruba] won't have it! [in English] As you all know, every battle has a beginning and an end. Obviously, I Yejide, Asake's daughter, I won the battle! And the loser Awele and her tout of a husband, left Otanwa community for me oh! Let us come back to the present. You all can say I am living a good life. - Mm-hmm, Yejide my friend! - Yes? Eh? [in Yoruba] Cooks so good that you'll lick your plate. That's me! I'm very interested in the takeaway. [laughs] The takeaway is definitely better. Please put beans soup. [Yejide] Everything was going fine for me. My beautiful children grew up lacking nothing. - What's up? - I'm good. [sighs] Life has indeed favoured me. Don't ask about my husband. [in Yoruba] It's not your concern. Take your bag inside. Go and join them in boiling the goat! - Did you hear me? Good. - Okay. Yes ma. Don't let it burn, it's ready. - Well done mummy! - Thank you! [indistinct background chatter] - Yejide. - Three... Yes, mummy. The soup is ready. - I'm going to my husband's house. - Grandma. - Okay mummy. - Grandma. - [in English] I will call you ma. - Thank you my dear. [in Yoruba] Ah, my son! - Welcome. - I'm hungry. Don't worry, food is ready. - [in English] How many amala? - [in Yoruba] Four ma, four. - Mummy! Bye mummy! - Yes? - Bye-bye my dear. - Bye ma! - Ehen! - What's up? Uncle! Aunty! Ah, my friends! [in English] Ha! You have started drinking beer. Ah. Allow me to drink beer. [in Pidgin] I'm in my friend's shop. - [laughing] - I'm in my friend's shop. Everything you're eating goes straight to your ass. [screams] Show us! - Thank you, let it go there. - My friend! My big ass! [Yejide singing] [all laughing] - God blessed us all. - Yes. On my end, it's shaking. - It's shaking. - [laughing] Please. What are we wearing to Iya Ramota's daughter's wedding? I was thinking we'll all wear white. [Iyadije] Happy ending, right? [in English] I guess not. - [in Pidgin] Who is this? - [indistinct background chatter] I'VE ARRIVED. MAKE WAY... [Yejide] Huh? [in English] Ha! My worst nightmare is back. - Ah-ah! - [indistinct background chatter] [in Yoruba] Awele took the shop in front of mine. Mummy! - And so? - [screams] Is this the first time someone is owning a shop in front of yours? Have we not seen or heard this before? Mummy competition will start. What competition? Is it today they started competing with us? Have they not been competing with us since? When you got married, didn't Ezinne make sure her daughter got married on the same day as you? [in English] And since they've been competing, are they ahead of us? [in Yoruba] Are they ahead of us? - Answer me! - No mummy. Why is this difficult? Don't die before death comes. [groans] But mummy, if her shop is right in front of mine, she's going to steal all my customers. [exclaims] What customer is she going to steal? What is wrong with you? Come, [in English] Have you forgotten who you are? [in Yoruba] I'm Asake, the amala seller, Yejide's mother who passed the amala making baton to you. - Isn't it so? - Yes mummy, you're right. But mummy you're the one cooking the amala soup. [in English] You're the one cooking the amala soup. [in Yoruba] Mummy, I can't prepare it. Now that Awele is here mummy, [in English] what if she cooks better than me? [in Yoruba] What are you scared of? Did I say I won't cook again? Look at me. I'm not dead. I'm not smelling. I'm not going anywhere. Come. What are you scared of? What is Awele cooking? Is it all those trash soups she's going to cook that's making you scared? Or is it her sick mother that can die at anytime that will come and cook for her? - [dramatic music playing] - Look at me, I'm standing right here! I'm standing firmly behind you. I'll keep cooking. Have you heard me? Mummy. [in Yoruba] I thought this was over. - What are you saying? - [in English] I thought it was over. [slams on table] What? It is not over! [in English] It is far from over! [in Yoruba] Look at me very well! The devil wants to eat with you and you said no. I'll continue making the soup. Look at me very well, we're all going to die there! Yes I said it! [sighs] [in Igbo] Wonders! [in English] So Awele, - you're truly back to Otanwa? - [claps] For the twentieth time, mama, yes. [exclaims] [in Igbo] What do you mean by that? Don't yell at me. [in English] If you were in my shoes, will you not be expecting a miracle? Mama, what miracle? - [in Igbo] I'm back already. - [phone ringing] And you're asking me about shoes and miracle. I don't want this please. [in English] Mummy, daddy is calling. Tell him that I said I do not want to talk to him. [exclaims] Why? Why? Hello? Daddy. Mummy said I should tell you that she doesn't want to talk to you again. [spluttering] Are you mad? What does she mean by that? Give your mummy the phone or else I'll come over there and slap you! - [in Igbo] Have you gone mad? - Ah-ah? [in English] Mummy, he said he'll come here and slap me. [in Igbo] Come, are you deaf? [in English] Tell him I said he's a bastard. - [exclaims] - [in Igbo] He's a nuisance. [in English] Daddy, mummy said I should tell you that you're a bas... [exclaims in Igbo] Shut up your mouth! Look at her! [in Igbo] Owl! [in English] Is that not Grandma's voice I'm hearing? It's Grandma. Should I give her the phone? - [spluttering] Give her the ph... - Come. - [Awele hisses] Idiot. - [Ezinne in Igbo] Just look at. You're sick in the mouth. [in English] By the way, why did you snatch the phone from her like that? Mama please. [in Igbo] Please. I'm begging you in God's name. [in English] This is my battle. Allow me fight it myself. Do not interfere. Please. Come, what... [coughing] Mama sorry! Sorry mama sorry. - This child wants to kill me. Leave me. - Sorry... You people cannot tell Mama sorry? - Mama sorry. - Mama sorry. [whimpers in Igbo] These children... [coughing] These children will kill me. [in English] Mummy I don't know why we left Agida. All my friends, my life. Everything is back there. We just woke up and moved! [in Igbo] Come, are you mad? Are you in your right senses? [mimicking] Everything is there, all my friends. - [laughing] - [in English] Go back now. Go and stay with your useless father and his concubines. Then you will know that home is wherever your mother says it is. Mummy, you could have just moved and you'll leave us there. Simple. [exclaims] - [in Igbo] What? - [Awele] Oh my God! Ifunanya. [in English] So you are this ungrateful? You would rather stay with your useless father, who has no respect for me or you his children. Just because you want to stay close to your friends back home. - [in Igbo] Right? - Mummy, [in English] that's between you and daddy. It has nothing to do with us. We have no hand in this, do we? - It's between you and daddy! - Come! It's between you and daddy! - [Ezinne] Ah-ah! - [in Igbo] Come! - I'll break your head. - What is it? - [Awele spluttering] - [Ezinne] Come! - [Awele] I'll break your head. - [Ezinne] I'll also break your head. - You're an idiot! - You're an idiot! [panting] [clicks tongue] Sit down! [panting] Head of idiots! [whimpering] I said you should sit down! [inhales sharply] This man has killed me. [Ezinne exclaims] In short... Ifunanya, you and your siblings should go outside. - Okay ma. - Excuse us. I have been dealt with. [Ifunanya clicks tongue] If I give you people slap! [Ezinne crying] I have been dealt with. I don't understand. Awele. [in English] Why? What is this? [in Igbo] My God! [Awele] Hey! [exclams in Igbo] Good gracious! Come, Nnaemeka. [in English] What is this I'm seeing? Ehn? What does it look like to you? Eh... - Mummy. - Daddy? [in Igbo] Did she say daddy? [in English] Take. Just... hold on to this for now. Hmm? - I'll see you later. - Thank you. [in Igbo] Come, Chukwuemeka. [in English] Is that not Ifunanya's WAEC money? [in Igbo] WAEC indeed! [in English] And so? Yes it is the WAEC money. Look at you. You think you can disgrace me in front of mummy. - [in Igbo] Who is mummy? - [in English] It won't work. - Mummy... - Yes. [giggles] Daddy. - I'll see you later. - Okay. Bye-bye. [in Igbo] Who is sweetheart? Give me that money! And she took the money! [in English] Are you alright? - [in Igbo] Are you alright? - [Awele screams] [Chukwuemeka] Are you mad? - [Awele screams] - Mummy. - Mummy, it's okay. - [girl] My money! Did he say mummy? Who is mummy? - Did she say mummy? - [screaming] Who is mummy? [girl whines in pain] - [in English] You slapped mummy? - Yes! - You slapped mummy? - [in Igbo] Who is mummy? - You slapped... - [scuffle] Who is mummy? [Chukwuemeka screams in pain] [Ezinne crying] You want people to mock me oh! [in English] How mama? Because I left a useless man? But why will you not stay and manage the marriage? Did I not stay with your father? [exclaims] What will people now say? The exact same thing they will always say, mama. They will say the same thing they will say if my husband kills me and renders my children motherless. [Ezinne groans] [exclaims] "Awele has left her husband's house." That is what they will say. Because for once I refused and I chose to put my children and myself ahead of what any other person will say. [indistinct market chatter] - Uncle! Aunty! - [Igbo highlife music playing] Simbi! [indistinct market chatter] Aunty! - Okay hurry! - [highlife music continues] Sorry. [man coughs] - Be fast! - Ah. - [coughing continues] - Customer! - ... order the food inside. - sorry [in Igbo] Come! Where are you? Come Kaira, bring water! [in English] Sorry.

She's fine. - Usual oh. - Sorry. [in English] Is it okay now? - Yeah I'm fine. Thank you. - Sorry. - [in Pidgin] I'm trying now. [laughing] - You tried. Do you want to order your usual? [in English] Yeah, I've come to make my order. - [man coughs] - Can I go out since this place is dry? [in Igbo] Come, are you speaking with your senses? Where is dry? Here? [in English] Idiot. Don't you know that there's power in the tongue? [in Igbo] And you're standing here and telling me it's dry. [in English] But mummy, the Bible says that we sh- Shut up your mouth. When last did you go to church? [in Igbo] And you're telling me about the Bible. [mocking] "The Bible says..." You'll buy gum and lollipop and chew it anyhow. [in English] You cannot use that your mouth to pray and say God, let my mother make money. - Sorry mummy. - Aha. Go there and call customers to come and buy the food your mother is selling. You're an idiot. [in Pidgin] Quickly Jacinta! How far? - Ehen. - Ah. Just tell madam she will deliver safely. - [in English] Amen. - And we'll come to eat and dance. [in Igbo] Get out of here. Hurry up now! You're always shaky. Ehen. Thank you very much. See this one here, I've told her that anytime you come, you'll get it - for free. - Ah!

Quickly, how much amala do you want? [indistinct chatter] - Attend to us. - We've been here since. Order! Go and take their orders inside! Please attend to us. - Please put meat. - Please answer us. Turn the stew quickly! - Ah! - Yes. Take, this is my plate. [market chatter] Attend to me, I want to buy food. - Answer me, this is my plate. - Mummy well done. Ah-ah!

[in English] Everybody is just going to aunty Yejide's shop. [in Igbo] Are you speaking with your senses? [in English] Who is your aunty? Ehn? [Ifunanya sighs] Mummy. [in English] Maybe you should just go to her for some ideas, you know? Because we're new in this area. Come, I'll slap you now. [snickering] Idiot. [in Igbo] Wasn't it you that said [in English] Mummy, if you want to be number one, let us go and buy this ankara table mat. Let us go and buy apron. Ehn? Let's go and buy food poster. This ugly one you bought with your foolish idea. [in Igbo] Come, are you people okay? [in English] Have you forgotten that they are our enemies? - Mummy. - Did she say mummy? Have you forgotten what her mother did to my mother? How she made life difficult for us? That's in the past. No matter what, we're still family. [in Igbo] Come I'll slap you now. - [girls snickering] - [in English] Stop that nonsense. Come here everybody. Let me warn you. I do not want to see you go near Yejide or her children. Did you hear me? - Yes mummy. - Yes mummy. Yejide, her children and her mother are our enemies. What did I say? - They're our enemies. - They're our enemies. Why? - Because mummy said so. - Because mummy said so. [in Igbo] It shall be well with you. She's standing there and listening - to me and she won't respond. - [snickers] She's listening to me and she won't answer. - Idiot. - [snickering] Now leave here. Quickly! Come in! Yejide, you're here! Quickly take her inside. Mummy, your phone is ringing ma. Who's calling? Hello? [laughs] Iya Sikira? Iya Sikira, please don't be annoyed. I've been busy. I'll call you back. Thank you. - If she calls back, pick. - Okay ma. - Tell her I'm busy. - Yes ma. Double up! Ah! [Asake] This soup is sweet. Hmmm. [in English] Do you know that Yejide's mother is the one cooking amala stew for Yejide? I saw it with my two naked eyes. - Really? - Yes! Well everybody knows that Yejide is [in Igbo] a useless person. She's useless. She cannot cook. [in Igbo] Mama, that's not what I'm telling you. - Really? - I said [in English] Yejide's mother is the secret to her success. - Really? [groans] - I'm telling you. - Really? - Yes. [exclaims] Well but, [in English] no matter what secret of success they use, you'll be better than them. [in Igbo] Mama that's not what I'm telling you about. What I'm saying is not what you're explaining. [in English] It's not about you'll do better. Ehn? Business is very dry. One or two customers for the whole day, mama. It will pick up, okay? [in Igbo] And she's telling me it will pick up. - She's telling me it will pick up. - [coughing] That's not what I'm saying. - Mama. - [groans] [in English] Kaira and Kaiso, they've done market survey of that Buka street. Only one person sells ofe akwu. [spits] It is not even as sweet at the one you used to make. You know you make the best ofe akwu? - [in Igbo] My goodness. - Hmm? Well so... [in English] what are you trying to say? Mama, God has done it. - [in Igbo] Really? - See, you'll stand up. You'll stand up and come and help me prepare ofe akwu - so I can have customers. - Really? - Yes. - So... I can, as I am, I will now help you, I will follow you - [in Igbo] Please. - to go and make ofe akwu. Please mama come and help me make ofe akwu, so I can have new customers. -Plea- -Oh. [in Igbo] My husband, welcome. [in English] Who is cooking ofe akwu for who? [Ezinne groans] [in Igbo] Welcome, Father. [clears throat] Welcome? Who is talking of ofe akwu? - [in Igbo] Yes that's her. - Hmm? Papa, it's business. [in English] God has done it. Mama has to stand up and help me come and cook ofe akwu so that I can have customers. - Is that what it's all about? - [Ezinne groaning] - God has done what? - [Ezinne continues groaning] God has made your mother sick so that she can come and cook ofe akwu for you. Sometimes.. look at how you're saying it like it doesn't mean anything. Have you looked at your mother and seen how sick she is? [coughing] And you want her to come and cook ofe akwu for you. - She's getting better now. - [Ezinne coughs] Why are you not going to be better in what you're doing? Look at her food. She has not even touched her food. You couldn't urge her to eat her food. - Only to come and cook ofe akwu for you. - [cough] [in Igbo] He has come again, can you hear him? Can you see? Ehn? [in English] I don't know the day that daddy is going to stand by me in this life. He wants my enemies to mock me. Your enemies? Who are your enemies? No, mention them. Tell me. Mention one. [in Igbo] I'll squeeze your mouth right now. I won't mention names. You're very stupid.

What's at your back? [in English] What's that? What? - [screams] - [in Pidgin] Sorry! [screams] Bro, why did you put the chair there? Ah! Please leave me!

Okay now. [laughs] - [Ademide] Sorry oh. [laughs] - [Ifunanya laughing] - I thought you knew. - [fuji music playing on stereo] [Ifunanya] How would I know? [snickers] [in Pidgin] Yeah but you have a job. It's not working, leave me alone. [both laughing] [in English] Wait, I thought you were in America? I'm guessing you're also in Canada. [laughing] Oh my God. See, our mothers will lose it if they find us talking. - [snickers] Mm. - Let alone eating together. - [in Pidgin] Wow! Man! - [Ifunanya laughing] - I don't even know. - [Ifunanya laughing] You know, I'd love to say mummy forced me to come out here, but the truth is it felt like my only way out. Yeah I know, right? You know, growing up around all that drama for such a small town! At some point, it felt like I was stuck. Like the demons who went after my father were coming after me. [sighs] See. May our village people lose their sight - Amen. Amen. - Before they see us. - [laughs] Amen. - One thousand times. - Amen. - [in Pidgin] One million times. Ah. This Lagos. Everybody says come to Lagos like it's easy. Like we'll just be walking on the streets, and see gold and pick it. - [chuckles] - Yes now. See I'm not going to lie. I'm tired of working for that woman. I saw how she was screaming at you. Why? And to think that she's a relative. Can you imagine? Man, I'm counting my days till I find something better to do. [scoffs] Please start counting fast, because time is going. You too, count fast. Thank you. - Ehen. - Thank you. Good evening customers. [in Igbo] Thank you. [in Pidgin] Hey my brother, how are you? Ehen how is... [exults] [in Igbo] Thank you so much! - My goodness! Thank you! - [in English] Welcome ma. Thank you, Iya Femi. Hello all. - Ah-ah. Iya Femi. - Ma?

Is this the right time to warm the ogbono soup? [in English] Welcome madam. Why are you just warming the soup? I'm sorry ma. - [in Igbo] Did she say sorry? - I'm sorry ma. Hello! Hey! Mama Joy! Hey! [laughs] [exclaims] How are you? You didn't bring garri for me again. - Awele. - Yes? - [in Pidgin] Garri is expensive now. - Really? Ah! I'm not in the garri business anymore. - [explosion] - [dramatic music playing] - [voice yelling] Fire oh! - [Awele] My shop! Pour the water inside the shop! [in Igbo] My goodness! - Run to my shop! - [glass shattering] Please water! Water! Help me oh! Look at my shop! - Look at my shop! Help me! - [dramatic music crescendos and ends] Officer. [sniffs] Officer please. [crying] I'm not a thief. I have never stolen anything before in my life I swear to God. Shut up! Everything starts in one day! Unfortunately for you, you were caught on your very first attempt at stealing! - Ify! - Will you sit down there! - What happened? - Ify, I don't know what's happening. - Excuse me. - Sir. [spluttering] Good morning sir. Sorry. - Good night. - Good afternoon. How may I help you? He's my cousin. So you're the one representing him, right? Yes sir. He stole from the factory where he works. No sir, I didn't steal any money sir... Will you shut up! - In fact. - Please... - Ah sir! Please! - Move it! - Please sir he's not a thief! - Move it! - Please don't take him away! - Take him away! - Sir please. Ask Ify! - Will you move! - Please. - Please ask Efe, he's my friend! - Move! - I didn't steal. I swear! [exhales] Yes, he didn't steal it. Everyone knows Fred stole the money. But why didn't you talk? Why did you let them arrest Ademide? [hesitating] Em... Okay, who is Fred? [spluttering] Sir talk! Oh God. Madam, give me four bottles of power oil. - Okay. - The big size. - [phone ringing] - Hello Fadekemi. Mummy it has happened! What? Mummy, you know that Aunty Awele keeps her kerosene keg beside her shop? [in Yoruba] Yes, what's my business with that? [in English] Mummy wait! That's how I paid one boy to swap the kerosene keg with petrol! - And so? - Mummy calm down, this is the interesting part. When she wanted to cook, they used the petrol! There was a loud bang! Mummy her shop has exploded! [in Yoruba] Ah! Fadeke has killed me! - [in English] So you burnt Awele's shop? - Yes, mom. The whole Buka street has scattered! Who sent you Fadeke?! You should have told me this was what you wanted to do! Ah, Mummy are they not the ones that brought cockroaches to our shop? Mummy I had to retaliate. I had to do this one. Ha! That's too much! It's extreme! But are you not the one that said that the battle line has been drawn? - Where are you now? - Mummy, I'm in the shop. Quickly go away! Go to grandma's house now! [in Yoruba] Go to grandma's house! - Come, Yejide! - [scream] So you sent them to burn my shop? - ["Gbas Gbos" by Adam Songbird playing] - [both yelling] [in Pidgin] You people should leave the front of my shop! You burnt my shop! - Why are they fighting? - [dramatic music playing] - [Yejide yells] - [woman] Separate them now! [in Pidgin] Cause I will put it on your body -Cause girl you will give in -[people continue screaming] [woman] My shop! [commotion] [woman] You'll pay for this! - You'll kill someone! - [women screaming] [women screaming] [woman yelling] My garri! [Awele] Yejide! - [commotion] - [women screaming] You'll kill each other here! You'll pay my money! You've thrown all my rice away! My garri! [screaming, commotion] Idiot! [screaming, jeering] [man] Hey! Hold that one! [screaming] You want to kill her! - [indistinct chatter] - [man] What sort of problem is this?! [indistinct chatter] What's all this? [Maduka in Igbo] This is getting too much! [in English] It's getting out of hand! [in Igbo] It has gotten out of hand! Maduka, calm down please. - Take it easy. - Me! Kanayo Maduka that owns the biggest - spare parts shop in Otanwa market. - [man exclaims] People come, they give me respect and the two of you are aware the kind of respect people give me! I go to give them advice! Now I'm being summoned by red cap chiefs to come and answer query because of these urchins. [in Yoruba] Huh! What? - [in Igbo] What did she say? - [Asake] Please, please! [in English] There's power in the tongue! [in Yoruba] There's power in the tongue. [in English] The only power you have resides in your tongue. I know, you don't need to sound it. But you should have been using those powers on your daughters. - [screams] Please. - Not on me. [in Yoruba] I know the child I gave birth to. I know. [in English] I have only one daughter. [in Igbo] Asake please... Don't put fire in this situation, please. Did you see kerosene with me? You are petrol yourself. [grunts] Over the years I have been telling Asake and Ezinne. Please stop this rivalry. You're quarreling with this person or the other, because it's going to be transferred to your daughters. Stop this, they didn't agree! I married them, Ibekwe, because I was - looking at them as educated people. - [Ibekwe] Mm. It was not education. It was illiteracy! They covered their illiteracy with paint of education. I should have married illiterates. - Me? - Yes. I am not an illiterate! I am the illiterate. Look at Diana and Ejiro. If I tell them to stand here, they will stand. Sit here they will. I have never had any cause to scold them. Or to quarrel with them. Do you people have any cause - to have my scolding? - Not at all. - Have I ever scolded you? - Not at all. [laughs] Why won't you say no? Because you don't have any other place to go to! - Where do you have? - Maduka, it's okay. This is my house and I'm not leaving! - Maduka calm down. - This is your house. At least let us thank God that the person affected did not die. - Ibekwe. - Yes? My pocket died. - [Awele in Igbo] Come, leave. - [Ibekwe] Nobody died! But that shop that got burnt, got somebody burnt too - and the person is hospitalized. - [Ibekwe] Aw. And I'm paying for the hospital bill! Yejide, why did you set your sister's shop on fire? Mazi Ibekwe please I don't want to say you're lying sir. - I didn't set her shop on fire. - [in Igbo] Lies. Papa, you all know how successful - I've been on Buka street. - [Awele] Mm. I've been the best food seller on Buka street. Any other one is a counterfeit! - Ride on! Tell them! - [in Yoruba] Yes mummy! Somebody suddenly came to Buka street. Causing trouble. Mazi Ibekwe can you imagine she sent cockroaches into my shop - just to spoil my business. - [in Igbo] Come, shut up, man. - I'll break your head. - Please, it's okay. Ah-ah! My daughters, take it easy with your father, you know he has high... Who are your daughters? [in Yoruba] Do you have a child here? - [in English] I'm talking to you! - Who are your daughters? It seems you've lost your mind! I'll hit your head! [indistinct shouting] Yejide! [in Yoruba] Is this you? Asake's daughter, amala seller. Is this you? [laughs] When you're not under a spell, you kept quiet. You'll go out and go spiritual. [in English] You will go spiritual. Spiritual, [in Igbo] right? [in English] Yes. I'm ready to go to any length, as long as it ends Yejide. [in Yoruba] Mummy, I don't want to be fetish. What did you say? You'll go beyond being fetish! Don't you know it's never easy to win? How else do you want me to say it? Mummy, I know. [in English] But I didn't think this thing would get to this level. - [in Yoruba] You see? - Ehn? I didn't ask Fadeke to set the shop on fire. Shut your mouth! You! You should hug Fadeke when you see her! You should be grateful and thankful to her! Do you think the way you slept is how Fadeke sleeps? We'd have been saying something different by now. I will not cry over you! I'm thankful she takes after me. Look at me! If Awele has to kill you, [in English] do you think Awele will think twice? Awele will kill and destroy you! And kill everything around you! [in Yoruba] She will do more than what she was asked. You've forgotten what her mother can do. Ezinne. And you want to wait. If there's anything greater than fire, we'll use it! [in English] You will kill them before they kill you! [in Yoruba] Have you heard me? See how your eyes are burning. And you said you didn't send her. Nobody should be relaxed. [in English] It is far from over. Mummy. What are you saying? I should go to church? [Awele hisses] Mother, when you said I should go spiritual, I thought you want to give me "back to sender". [mimicking gunshots] That will attack the attacker. Pursue the pursuer and destroy the destroyer. Ehn? [weakly in Igbo] Awele, my child. [in English] Please. When your father called for a meeting, You see that I could not attend... because my health... [whimpers] it is getting worse. [coughs] [in Igbo] Sorry. [sniffs] Please. [sobbing] [in English] Let us drop the weapons. Did you say I should drop the weapons? [in Igbo] Please. Please. [in English] Did somebody swap my mother with another mother? No. It is still the same me. Strong. Bold. Ezinne. [in Igbo] No. [in English] My mother will teach me how to attack. She will give me weapons to fight my enemies. [in Igbo] Please. [in English] Let us not attack... Asake and her children anymore. Mama, please change this topic. [in Igbo] Don't say this please. This thing you're saying is annoying me. Don't say that! [in English] They burnt my shop. [in Igbo] And you're telling me peace. [in English] That is why I said... [coughs] you will go to church. So that the prayer warriors can intercede for you. Inside ice-cream church? - Ehn? - Yes. [wheezing] Even if you say we should go to church, let it be the one that has a strong Prophet or even Alfa. So I can see results quickly. Whatever you choose to do, [in Igbo] please, don't attack Yejide. - Please. - [exclaims] Hey! - [in Igbo] Oh my Goodness! - [in English] You see, when you get to my age, when you grow older, learn to choose your battles. Are you listening to me? [exclaims] Hey! [male voice] [in Pidgin] See, nobody teaches anybody how to be smart in Lagos. If Ademide had any sense, he won't be paying for another man's crime. [in English] But you shouldn't have roped my cousin. [in Pidgin] Oh please! I can rope anybody I like. Ask about me. I told Ademide to join me. But he wanted to show he was an honest person. Now see what has happened to him. [in English] I don't understand, what... [in Pidgin] But please... I agreed to give you an audience because you're a fine girl. [in English] Wow. This is a very good evidence that can help the case. You know what? We'll investigate further and I'll make sure that we get to the root of this. Oh, thank you. I, Awele, drop my weapon. For who? That thing that will throw the next punch anytime? Never! [in Igbo] No. [in English] You see, your mother is right. You need to calm down. You need to calm down. You need to take things easy. [in Igbo] Come, Kareem. [in English] If you were in my shoes, you will do worse. - Yes! - [emotive music playing] Look at this woman here. This woman that looks frustrated like this. Do you know how many battles I have fought? Do you know how many demons I have wrestled with? Since I was born, I have known no peace. Is it in Kanayo Maduka's house? Or in the failed marriage to a useless drunkard that beats me? And I have three children to cater for all by myself. And then the only thing that I have to take care of them with [in Igbo] gone! My number one enemy burnt it to the ground. And you're asking me to calm down? If it is you, will you calm down? - [Awele sniffs] - [emotive music continues] Take this. [in Hausa] Nobody ends war with war. A solution must be found or we go back to the table. [in English] I used to be the biggest farmer in Otanwa. But a rival set my farm ablaze. I lost everything that I worked for. But I thank almighty Allah that gave me a father that taught me something. He said no matter the amount of revenge, it will never bring back what I've lost. Never. Not even that. The wife I was supposed to marry, her family called off the wedding. Because they said I had nothing. I had no money. So I'm useless and I can't marry their daughter. So you see, you're not the only person with painful experiences. So please, please I'm begging you, please calm down. Calm down. [sniffs] Mallam, the only reason I came here is to say thank you because you paid my own part of what was destroyed at the market. - No, don't worry. What are friends for? - Hey! [menacingly] I am not your friend. [yelling] Because if I am your friend, you will not ask me to calm down! - [hisses] - Awele. Ah-ah? [in Yoruba] Yejide, daughter of Asake. You have seven mountains to climb. And you have one day to do it. Once you get down from the seventh mountain, you'll see a river. It is a deity river. That's where you will bathe with the soap and sponge with you. You will go and return in peace. [male voice speaking in tongues] - [bell rings] - [man] Hey. [laughs] [male voice speaking in tongues] - [in English] I want to end her. - Hm. Cancel her. You have come to the right place. Where your prayers will be answered quickly. [Pastor laughs, speaks in tongue] [in Yoruba] Where are my prayer warriors? - [rings bell] - Where are you? [in English] Come over! Ah! [laughs] [in Yoruba] War has come! [screams] - [in English] We're going to pray. - Mm. Mm! We're going to pray. What did I say? We're going to pray. [groans and pants] [in Yoruba] I won't be tired. I won't be tired. I will climb this mountain. [male voice] You must not get tired. I have spoken to authority from the highest places so you must not get tired. Once you finish bathing, you will overcome your enemies. Awele or what is she called? [laughs] She has gone mad. [exhales] [rings bell, speaking in tongues] -[in Pidgin] Lord, answer me quickly -Answer me quickly -Lord, answer me quickly -Answer me quickly... [in English] Make sure you're praying. -Lord, answer me quickly -Answer me quickly -Lord, answer me quickly -Answer me quickly... - Jesse! - Sir! - Bring the incense, now! - Okay sir! How long will it take to light it? I'm coming! -Lord, answer me quickly -Answer me quickly - [Jesse] Ah-ah! - Answer me quickly... - I'm sorry sir. - Lord, Lord, Lord -Lord, answer me quickly -Answer me quickly... - [Yejide grunting] - [melancholic music playing] [panting] [in Yoruba] That's water. It should be water. [panting] [feebly] It should be water. [in English] It's water! Water! It's water! [male voice in Yoruba] Abomination! No evil will come to you! -No, if you don't finish your task, -[grunts] you musn't eat or drink. I've forgotten! [groans] [panting] [phone ringing] Hello mummy. Mummy, can you hear me? I can't hear you! Hello, Yejide? Hello mummy, I'm tired. Sorry my child. [in English] You will make it! [in Yoruba] Have you heard? Don't worry. [in English] What number are you on now? I'm on the third mountain top. [in Yoruba] I'm on the third mountain top. Sorry, it will pay off. Okay? [in English] Take a little rest whenever you're tired. Mummy, I cannot rest. I can see two small... [panting] rocks in front of me. [in Yoruba] There's a small one and a big one. [panting] [in English] Let me just climb it and finish. [huffs] [in Yoruba] I've heard you. I'll call you back. Okay? [in English] Okay. [in Yoruba] Bye mummy. Take it easy! [speaking in tongues] Ah! [in Yoruba] Rise up! What does the [in Yoruba] worm do? It wiggles. But when the heavenly salt touches the worm, it wiggles and dies. - Yejide, you're the worm. - Yes. - You will wiggle until you die! - Yes. [speaking in tongue] We're going to pray. - Oh God! - [prayer warriors] Oh! Let Awele defeat her enemies! [in Pidgin] Hello, guy. Please help me play Madrid. - [Pastor] Let Yejide be under Awele. - [Jesse] Over two point five. - Pray! Awele! - I'm in church! I'll give you money when I come, please. Okay? Thank you. Let Awele defeat her enemies! [in English] That's the spirit at work! - [Awele screaming] - Fire! Fire! Fire! - Fire! - Get water! [Awele screaming] My leg! My leg! [screaming] - [screaming] - Fire [groans] - [panting] - [phone ringing] [in Yoruba] Hey, who is calling?! Look mummy, I'll call you back, you're distracting me. [in English] I'm about to climb the fourth one. [hisses] [dramatic music playing] [screams] [male voice]The soap and sponge must not touch the ground. Mummy has put me in trouble. All I have said today must come to pass. [exclaims] Hey! Hey! Hey! Ah! Awele has gotten me. Mummy has put me in trouble. [screaming] Ah! [groans] You should have just allowed me go to the Health Center. See, this will not give you a scar. - [groans] - Yes. [exclaims] If I catch Kaiso and Kaira, ehn? Your children? Don't put your pain on them. Why? Why are they not here? Ehn? Why did they go out? This whole house, nobody is here to assist me with this pain. But I'm here with you now. I'm here to help you with anything you need. Thank you. You still didn't tell me how you got your leg burnt. [in Hausa] Did you fight somebody? [in Igbo] What does that mean? [in English] Did you fight somebody? Yes. I'm a fighter, [in Igbo] right? So fire cannot burn somebody in peace, right? [in English] Now you're fighting me. I'm not fighting you. It's because you're asking too many questions. [in Igbo] Saying what I don't know. - Don't do that. - Do what? You see, I know you're passing through a lot. And everything is getting to you. But you just have to be calm. Mm? Don't push away the people that care for you. - So you care about me? - [soft music playing] Isn't that obvious? Mm? You care about a woman that used to fight. Why? Because you're a strong woman. [in Hausa] Stunning. Very beautiful. But you are stubborn. I like it too. [chuckles] But not too much. [wincing] [in Igbo] My God! [hissing] [in Pidgin] Please, take your leave. Thank you. [wincing] You'll kill me my God! - Sorry. - [wincing] [in English] I'm here till your kids come back. But you were about to cook when I called for help. - I'll eat later. - [soft music playing] I have egusi and garri. Do you want? Yes. [hisses] Mummy, mummy! You won't believe who we just saw! - [Kaiso] Ademi... - [Kaima screams] - Ehn? - [dramatic sting] - Ifunanya. - Yes, I'm back. I am tired. I will not go back to that aunty Vero, who doesn't know the difference between an apprentice, and a full time slave. [in Igbo] Listen to me. [in English] Since you have decided to disgrace me. Your child will also disgrace you. [exclaims] Hah! [Awele in Igbo] You'll see. [in English] Mummy, why? You cursed me. Just because you want to be on top of this rivalry. And if you must know, Ademide is also not in America. I saw him in Lagos. Ademide, why? - Why? - Were you ev... Mummy, were you even listening to what I was saying since? If I had remained there, I'd have been in serious trouble. Even if you wanted to come back, [in Yoruba] you should have called me. You just brought your bags and came. Mummy, you don't pick calls! [in English] Do you know how many times I called you to complain about what I'm going through in Lagos? - [Yejide] Eh? - And you don't pick! It's because I want you to work hard. [in Yoruba] I don't want your life ruined. Ehn, Ade. You didn't see anybody else to play with except Ifunanya. Awele's daughter, my enemy's daughter! [in English] Mummy. Ifunanya is the only reason why I'm not sharing a prison cell block with your husband. I've told you never to talk about your father like that again! [in Yoruba] What's wrong with you? If not because of what happened, all these issues won't occur Ah, what am I going to do now? [clicks tongue continuously] This child has turned me into a liar. [in English] Ademide, the whole community believes you're in America. Ehn? You know what? You will lock yourself in your room. You will remain indoors. Because I don't want people to see... [in Yoruba] What's funny? - [in English] I should stay indoors? - Yes. People have seen me! Everybody has seen me! Mummy, look I just came here to clear my head, and figure things out with my music before I go back to Lagos. You and mummy Ifunanya that lied, good luck to you. Because Ifunanya and I are back. [Yejide exclaims] Ah! Ademide. [exclaims] Ah! [bangs table] [in Yoruba] This boy has put me in trouble and turned me into a liar. God don't let my enemy get me. - [siren blaring] - [dramatic music playing] [gunshot] Lord you gave me life and made me know You're the boss. The boss oh!

My husband. [sniffs] [in English] I'm so happy to see you. [in Yoruba] My husband. I'm happy to see you. [clicks tongue, sighs] [in English] Lanshile I tried. - I tried to get justice. - I know. - But it didn't work. - I know. You know, I know that running from prison is a grievious offense. [in Yoruba] But I had to run when I saw how everyone was escaping. Look my husband, it's good you escaped. Ah! You've suffered enough. Look. You're not going back! [in English] Enough is enough. [in Yoruba] Whatever it takes, we'll give. Look at your child, she's older. Ademide is older too. You're not going back! [in English] I'm so happy to see you. [sobbing] [in Yoruba] Fadeke come to me. Come and greet me. [crying] No. - Fadekemi, this is your father. - Mummy, no. [crying] Mummy no! [Fadekemi crying] - Give me that phone! - [Fadekemi crying] [in English] I'm not a stranger. [phone thuds on the table] [in Yoruba] It's okay, my husband. Look, leave her alone. We'll come back to this matter. My child doesn't know me. Let me cut your hair - She doesn't know me. - [Yejide] So you can bathe. She doesn't know me. - Leave her. - I was looking at her. - She doesn't know me. - Leave her. - Let me cut your hair. - [cricket chirping] Lanshile, please eat. I'm not hungry. Ah! I'm not hungry. Please call Fadekemi let me talk to her. - Please. - She's sleeping. [in English] You'll talk to her tomorrow morning please. [in Yoruba] Please. Wake her up. [in English] Let me feed you. [in Yoruba] The food is delicious. It's very delicious. Look. Good. Can you see it's delicious? Asake the amala seller cooked this? - [licks fingers] - Right? [in English] You remember my mother's stew. - It's unforgettable. - I brought the remaining from the shop. I can never forget it. I miss it. [laughs] - [laughs] - [door unlocks] Don't be scared, it's Ademide! He has a key. Sit down! Hello. - [closes door] - [Lanshile] Ademide. Your dad is back. [door locks click] [in English] Come and meet him. - How are you? - I know who he is. [Yejide sighs] It's hard to forget the face that keeps me awake at night. - Ah. - Ademide. Don't talk like that. Oh. He's a part of the jail break, right? That's why he's here. - [scoffs] - Right? Ademide. - [in Yoruba] Please. - Hey. I'm not talking to you. Please let's talk. Don't talk to your father like that. Why are you talking to your father... - Mummy, how could you? - Sit down. Please sit down, my husband. After all these years, you allowed him come back into our home? - [scoffs] Ademide. - Sir... Do you know what they called me growing up? - [in Yoruba] Son of a murderer. - Ah! Ademide! [in English] I've told you it's all lies. You know the truth. Your father is innocent. Mummy, of all those people, 95 percent of them believe that this man you call my father killed that man out of jealousy! And it's true! - Ademide! - Mummy, no! We struggled because of him. Struggled, how? [in Yoruba] I'm the one who went through it all. [in English] I hustled to raise you and your sister. - Yes you tried. - You didn't lack anything. You tried but we still can't stand on our own two feet! Everywhere we go, this man's stigma follows us around. It wasn't until grandpa made a move to help me clear my image, that I finally found a chance to shine. And now that things are getting better, I will not allow some jailbird try to spoil it! How dare you talk about your father like that? How dare you! [in Yoruba] It's okay. Please. [in Yoruba] When you're not a bastard. How dare you call your father that?! [in Yoruba] Ademide please. [in English] It's a long story. Let me tell you. [in Yoruba] Let him be. [key clinks on the floor] - Ademide! - Bastard! Listen... Don't be angry with him. [sobbing] I'm sorry. - [yelling] My shop! - [screaming in background] [yelling] I'm in trouble! [screaming] My shop! Help me! - [yelling] I'm dead! - [screaming in background] My money is gone! [screaming, commotion] [in Pidgin] My money! All my money! All my money! All the money I saved is gone! Everything is gone! - [screaming] - Sorry madam! These prisoners are causing a lot of havoc in Otanwa. Hold on, [in Pidgin] is it the prisoners that escaped that did all this? [in English] Who else? Since they broke out of the prison, we've not had peace in this community. - [noise in background] - I'm sorry. [screams] My shop! [screaming] [in Pidgin] We interrupt this program to bring you the latest news. The police have released the names of the escaped inmates from the Elesho maximum prison Their names are, Kelechi Okoli. Akeem Quadri. Olalekan Aremu. Uche Nwaneri. Usman Ahmed. Wale Adeniran. Lanshile Aladesimi. [in Yoruba] Enter. Enter quickly. Just come on inside. Yejide, are you sure this place is safe? [scoffs] Darling. [in English] Darling this is the safest place I can think of for now. [in Yoruba] Apart from the small farms here that people don't go to, nobody passes here. I was thinking we should turn around, because it's a lot of problem. I don't want to cause problems for you and the children. Ah! Lanshile. I reject it, my Creator rejects it! Ah! See those children will never lose you again. Don't say that again. [in English] See, I've started making plans for you to leave this town in a few days. [in Yoruba] I just want you to hide here for a while. [in English] Ademide already thinks I'm a bad person. [in Yoruba] Fadeke cannot even come close to me not to talk of speaking to me. What was the point of me escaping? [in English] My husband with time everything will fall in place. Please just be patient. Enter let me arrange this side. I'll make it liveable for you. Let's go. [Yejide grunts] Quickly. Come on. [in English] Mummy! Mummy! Mummy! Where are they? I don't know. They just left in a hurry. See... [clicks tongue] Look, we need to let everyone know. Ademide. - Didn't mummy say we shouldn't... - Tell anybody, right? Yes. And she seized my phone - so I don't even have... - Look, I don't care. - We will tell. - [door opens] Hello. Ah, mummy. Where are you hiding him? [in Yoruba] Bring down your voice. I've told you to stop shouting. [in English] Mummy, you can't be doing this! Not now that my music career is about to take off. Mummy, I am performing at the Otanwa youth carnival, and nothing will jeopardize my chances. Ah. [clicks tongue] [in Yoruba] What a pity. [in English] Ademide, why are you so selfish? Do you think this world is all about you? Mummy. There has been armed robbery attacks by those jailbirds all over Otanwa. If people find out that you've been hiding him, we all are going to be in trouble! Your father knows nothing about the robbery. How would you know? This man just broke out of prison after so many years and you take his word for it? Ademide, no! See, I don't think daddy is evil. No. Daddy is a criminal. [in Yoruba] Shut your mouth! It's time to speak out. [in Engish] It's time to talk. [in Yoruba] Behaving like a bastard! Let us talk! [sighs deeply] [in English] What happened here? He was trying to harass me. And I took the bottle to defend myself. - Did he hurt you? - I was the one that stabbed him. Ah. [in Yoruba] He's not breathing. He's not breathing. - He's... - What should I do? Call my mummy? - Or po-call my mummy or the police? - Don't call the police. - Lanshile... - Are you okay? Give it to me. Give me this. Give me this one. You see, whatever happens, I did it. [in Yoruba] What? You? - I'm the one. I did it in self defense. - I know. Am I stupid? I know. - Now go. Go. - Lanshile. You can't take the fall - for what you didn't do. - [hushing] It's okay. [crying] You and me, you're okay. Did he hurt you? Now go. No, Lanshile! Please go! Do you want them to meet both of us here? Be going. Listen, whatever happens, don't tell anybody the truth. - Okay? It's okay. - Lanshile... - I can't do this to you. - Clean your hands. Clean your body very well. [in Yoruba] I did it. [in English] Go! [sniffs] That was how I ran. When the police got involved and they picked your father, he let them know that he was only defending me. And in the process Prince died. Nobody believed Lanshile. Just because of the history of the rivalry between him and Prince over my matter. [sniffling] So with the influence of Prince's family, Olanshile was locked up. He remained in the prison for years, awaiting trial. [crying] To date, your father never stood before any judge. Nobody sentenced him to prison. Just awaiting trial. [crying] Mummy. Why didn't you tell us this story before now? Ademide, I told you people everything. The only thing I hid was that I killed Prince. Just because your father said I shouldn't say it outside. Maybe if you had told us, it would have have helped prepare our minds. [crying] We would have known that he fought for you. And ignored all the negativities about him. [clapping] We have to revisit daddy's case. We can't keep quiet about it. Mummy we have to do something. I've tried. - Mummy, see. - Yes? We're going to protect daddy with everything that we've got. We have to keep him safe until we can figure out a way to get him justice. [door unlocking] Code. 24 August. [exhales shakily] [in Yoruba] Enter quickly. [Fedemike cries loudly] Daddy. Please don't be angry with me. - [Ademide] Sorry. - [crying] Daddy, we're sorry. My child stand up. - [sobbing intensifies] - I'm sorry. We're sorry. I knew it. I knew she was hiding something. [in Igbo] I said it. [in English] I said it. But nobody believed me. Awele. [in Pidgin] You like problems. Awele, you're hot tempered. [in English] Calm down. Meanwhile, the main culprit is Yejide and her husband. She has sworn an oath that there'll be no peace in Otanwa community. - [coughing] - [in Igbo] Sorry mother. [in English] You want water? Please drink water. Drink water. Okay? You don't want water? [in Igbo] Eheh. Sorry okay? Sorry. - Awele. - Mother. [in English] Let it go. For what? I must expose them. That woman and her husband, who is a murderer. To what end? Till I get my pound of flesh. - [emotive music playing] - The reason you want to talk is not because you care for this community. [sighs] It is because you... - want revenge. - And so? Is that not what you taught me? And I'm telling you I regret it. [coughing] [in Igbo] Sorry, mother. - Let it go. - No! I'm begging you in God's name, do not regret it. [in English] This one, leave it for me. I will show them action. I will show them action! Just leave this one! She thinks I'm playing with her. Does she think I'm playing with her? [hisses] Do you remember that time - when... - [emotive music intensifies] Mother. Mother! Mother! [in Igbo] Come. Mother! Mother! Mother please! Mother!

Please ma, please... - Sorry. - [Asake screams] - [Asake sighs] - Sorry. [screaming] [exclaims] [Yedije grunts] Ah, mummy. Yejide. Why are you wearing black? God will not allow me to mourn. Why did you come in the rain? Mummy, my step mother is dead. I have to wear black to honor her. [in Pidgin] And so? [in English] Ezinne is dead. She has gone to her grave. [chuckles] Ah, eh, gone to her grave - Ah, mummy. - Ah, eh, gone to her grave [in Yoruba] What? Don't mock the dead. We will all die someday. I didn't say we won't all go, everybody that came to this world must leave. But we're not going anywhere right now because we will grow old. Do you understand? - Mummy. - What? Awele's mother is dead, but don't mock her. It's okay mummy. It's too much. Let's leave all this alone. Ah-ah, Yejide. - When did you change your song? - [scoffs] See, when one gets old, they fight with caution. Enough is enough. Mummy I'm tired. I'm tired. [exclaims] You're tired? Why won't you be tired? Lanshile has come out and you've seen him. What? Mummy, I didn't see Lanshile. I didn't see him.

Listen please, whatever problems we have, let's solve them as a family. [in Igbo] Who is your family? [in English] Mad people. - [Yejide] Ah. - [Ifunanya] Mummy. - Mummy, they saved my life. - [soft music playing] - They saved my life. - [Awele] Hm. Ademide carried me in the middle of the night to this place. And they revived me. If not because of them, I would have been dead. Lies! They're acting a movie. Yes! Why didn't you take her to the house? This place is closer, that's why. Hm! They brought you here because they know there's a secret they're hiding. That will soon be exposed. So they're trying to win over more people. Ah, Awele. - Isn't it? - Aunty Awele please. Let it go, mummy. - [Yejide] Awele please. - Mummy please let it go. Let what go? - Ehn? - Mummy please.

You'll destroy yourself and your children. - Ah! - Because you're going to jail. - Ah! - Yes! - Aunty Awele. - [in Igbo] Who is your aunty? - Ehn? - Awele. [in English] Going to prison has taught me some lessons. - Listen. - Please... Everybody can witness the beginning of a battle, but nobody can tell where it will end. It is because you want revenge. [in Pidgin] And so? [in English] Is that not what you taught me? And I'm telling you I regret it. [coughing] Awele. Let it go. - Please. - [Awele hisses loudly] - Mummy, please. - [Lanshile] Awele, don't do this. - [Awele] Leave here! - [Lanshile] Awele. - ["Gbas Gbos" by Adam Songbird playing] - [mob shouting] Mummy the youths are coming!

We're here to work on it, - this useless woman! - She's a witch! I will slap you! Your life will be ruined! Hey! You know you told me my brother that you saw Ifunanya come here. So I decided to come and look for Ifunanya, and I saw Ifunanya's slippers here. This mad woman here refused to allow me inside. So I used my instincts and said, - she's hiding something there. - Mama Ifunanya. But you told me you saw one of the men that escaped from the prison - and that is why we're here! - Yes! [in Igbo] No please. You see, the problem is... Come I'll break your head! - The problem is what? - This woman! [scream] - [in Igbo] My God! She bit me! - [Yejide in Yoruba] Bastard! Mama Ifunanya, the problem is what? Hey! So you mean that you didn't confirm that you saw somebody and you made me assemble the youths! - We even called the police. - What? Police? -Yes -I didn't ask you to call the police. I just said I thought that... Come, this woman is a witch! Help me beg her to release my daughter from juju! What kind of nonsense is this? I did not carry her daughter you people! Why are you people doing this? I didn't - take her daughter. - She kidnapped my daughter. - What trouble is this? - This is my mother's property Help me! You're an idiot! My goodness! Kinzo! Come. Youths, it's a lie. You know if this woman didn't see anything, she won't make it up? - That's right. - Yes! We must search this place. - We need to. - Yes!
