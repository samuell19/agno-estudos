(Madame Olga hums) (piano music) (bright soft music) (footsteps clumping) I'm scared. - What of? - I told you that the Englishman who rented the room for a month hasn't arrived yet and today's the 29th. (window clicks) (door clicks) And what if your mother comes up to clean? She never comes up here anyway. (footsteps clumping) It's beautiful here. What's in there? (footsteps clumping) The kitchen. (door slams) (door slams) (hatstand clatters) Don't worry, it does that every time you close that door, my mother's screams about it but she never fixes the nail. What if someone heard? Who? There's nothing up above and Madame Olga is either billing herself or getting someone else to. (sings in foreign language) It's supposed to be a love story. Does he live here? Who? The officer. I doubt it. Ever since I was little she's been singing that, he hasn't left her yet. Will you leave me? Already? (sings in foreign language) Come upstairs and look. (sings in foreign language) (footsteps clumping) (sings in foreign language) Count to 10. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. (footsteps clumping) (both laughing) Do you like the bed? It's all right. No sheets. Not yet, my mother was going to put them on when the Englishman arrived. You told me there'd be sheets. And you tell me you love me. I do love you but I want the bed with sheets. All right, but you saw what happened at the hotel. You were scared, admit it, when they asked how old you were. No, I wasn't. Of course, you were. I'm not scared of anything. Oh, no? All right, if you think I'm scared of everything, then all we have to do is leave. Don't be silly. (mellow music) It's a real bed, isn't it? (mellow music) Would you like me to try and pinch some sheets? No, I did say sheets, but we've waited a long time, haven't we? Yes, a long time. (mellow music) Why do they always say we're too young? We say they're too old, we'll get over it. Do we have to take our clothes off? You think it's better? Yes. (soft suspenseful music) What if your mother comes up, you're not scared? No. (soft suspenseful music) Let me, you have big fingers. I don't have big fingers. You do, ever since we started working for that locksmith. All right, even if I have big fingers. You're so silly. No, you don't have big fingers. (soft suspenseful music) (people murmuring) (bell chimes) Bojour madame, a baguette, please. No, half. As you wish. 25 Centimes. - Okay. - (bell chimes) (engine roars) (wipers buzzing) Wait here, I'll be a little while. (wipers buzzing) (door slams) (wipers buzzing) (door slams) (wipers buzzing) I'd like a quarter of a pound of your pate de campagne, please. The rillettes are more expensive, aren't they? Well, of course, sir. Then I'll have the pate and the bottle of your Vin Ordinaire, how much is it now? 275. It's gone up, Well, everything has and it is no better. That will be five altogether. Two dozen of the Portuguese, the small ones. Two dozen, here we are little lady. Maybe you only give me a dozen and a half. Some people don't know what they want. I agree with you. Then they regret it the rest of their lives. (paper rustling) (door knocks) (spoon clatters) What is it? My name's Rolling, I rented the studio for September. Oh, Mr. Rolling, the English man and you land on us at this hour? But you never moved in. I used to live in that room once, I remember that in the concierge was Madame Boudin. Oh, that is my mother, Madame Boudin. Mama, do you remember this gentleman? He says he lived here before. I don't see too well anymore. Oh, wait. (door clicks) Rolling, you used to call me Geoff, Madame Boudin. Oh, Geoff, and so you've come back to see us, that's nice. For one night, yes. All alone? No, not alone, I'm waiting for a friend. Uh, I thought so. So, I go up with you and bring you some sheets. Thank you, but it's not necessarily, if you'll just give me the key, I know the way. Oh and here, thank you for being so helpful. Oh, you didn't have to do that. Just to make up a little for what I could never give Madame Boudin. Could I have the keys, please? (keys clings) (soft piano music) (footsteps clumping) (soft piano music) (door clicks) (soft piano music) (door slams) (hatstand clatters) (soft piano music) (footsteps clumping) A dozen and a half. A dozen and a half, not two. I didn't have enough money and I stole the lemon just like before. Nothing much has changed. No and the hatstand still falls down when you shut the kitchen door, do you want to see? Don't move, if you move, one of us will wake up and run away. (footsteps clumping) 15 years, Patricia. I wonder how many other couples have been here since then? Don't, this is our room, it always was our room. (Patricia inhales) Foolish Geoff. Yes. I'm famished, let's set the table. Yes. (footsteps clumping) First I must open the oysters, oysters, can you believe that's what we had the first time. Anything is possible the first night. (footsteps clumping) (utensils clatters) They've lost a knife, you know the other knife that was so good for oysters? And they've changed the plates, these are not our plates, Geoff. How thoughtless. I bought you these violets, and what I could never give you before, champagne and caviar. You cheated. If it's the same vanodinair, it's undrinkable. I was cheating anyway to think we could have the same thing as we had before. We're not the same. (footsteps clumping) Let's taste the pate for old time's sake and eat all the caviar. (champagne pops) That was a shot. No, it wasn't. Listen, there's someone in the studio. Couldn't be, it's the 29th. I can see the lights on, it's your mother. (indistinct) It must be the English man, he's here with a girl, we've had it. We'll have to get out by the window. After like that the 29th, the last night, that's the English for you. Pass me by things, quick, they're under the chair. (wood creaks) Let's go back to bed and not move, that's the best place not to make any noise. I hope they don't need to come up. Why do you think they came here? I'd certainly remember my wedding night. Yes you will and so will I. Now, let's stay on the bed and pretend they're not there. (bright soft music) (champagne pours) (bright soft music) It's not easy to be poor with a pretty girl. It's not easy to be a pretty girl. (bright soft music) (match stick strikes) (bright soft music) What about the painting? Well, to be honest, I really don't think I have much talent. And what about your dancing? Oh, I married Robinson 'cause he's going to subsidise a bet at Monte-Carlo, he did subsidise a bet at Monte-Carlo but not even Robinson could make a ballerina out of me. (bright soft music) So, we did the right thing? (bright soft music) Undoubtedly, we got scared, that's all, scared of really living. Yes, we were wrong, Pat. No. We were wise. (bright soft music) We finally understood that we weren't heroes. (bright soft music) Do you often cheat on your wife, Geoff? Don't you ever cheat on Robinson? (dog barks) (footsteps clumping) But we're not cheating on them, Pat, we're cheating on ourselves and have been for 15 years. You're too rich now, you can't afford to be romantic. (Geoff chuckles) What did you think when I suggested this rendezvous? I didn't, I said yes and thought later. What'd you think I was gonna ask you? To make love, naturally. (footsteps clumping) - You're too cynical for me. - Why? It's an agreeable occupation and good for you. I do it lots. Without really wanting to, without love? Love? What a question? It's a child's disease I never caught again. (spoon clatters) It'll pay or what frightened you? Your eyes, they used to have a certain warmth. It died out. Let's go up and make love, hmm, it's really why we're here. What are we waiting for, we finished the pate, if this is like the last time, the moment has come. No, Pat. Don't I appeal to you anymore, I'm I that much older, less attractive? No much more. You used to be rather sort of skinny. Yes, that was what you liked, wasn't it? (pigeons grumble) (dog barks) No, not this way. (bright soft music) Yes, this way. Not like before, please, but the way I do it now with anybody, tall, dark, athletic, young, those empty eyes and healthy teeth, that's all I need. (bright soft music) (pigeon grumbles) You're frightening, Pat. Nope, I'm dead. Nobody knows it, I laugh, I make a lot of noise, for 15 years now, I've been dead. Come on, let's go up. Come on, we better go before it's too late. (footsteps clumping) (soft music) (footsteps clumping) We're sorry, Madame, we are not burglars. Besides there's nothing here worth stealing. Let me try and explain, I'm the son of the concierge. Well, how did you get in, the door was locked? By the window over the roof of the laundry, you can climb down that way. Yes, I know. [Boy] Do you? I went out that way myself, often. You are the English man. [Geoff] That's right. You see, you never moved in and it's the 29th, I thought the room would still be empty tonight, you know? It's the first time we ever had a chance to be alone, Simone and me. That's Simone, she's my friend. You might have, just cover up in front of Monsieur Simone. We're just leaving m'sieur dame. No. Was it the first time? Yes, Madame. Do you love each other? Do you love each other? [Boy] For a long time, she lives next door, (footsteps clumping) But she wanted a real bed, so. Champagne, caviar, violets, take them up there and go back to bed, the room is yours and remember, you don't make love just once, isn't that right, Geoff? (footsteps clumping) Bonsoir m'sieur dame and good luck. Sir, if you really want to be nice, don't let my mother see you, if she thinks you're still up here, she'll never dare come up. Understand? Yes, I understand that, child, we'll creep out on all fours just as we used to. (footsteps clumping) (door slams) - Can you believe it? - (Boy chuckles) I told you, I never do things by halves (laughs). (soft suspenseful music) (footsteps clumping) Now, down. (footsteps clumping) (both laughing) (water burbles) (broom scrapping) Bye. (footsteps clumping) (bright epic music) (wings flapping) (bright epic music) (soft sombre music) (broom scrapping) (footsteps clumping) (soft sombre music) (boy whistling) (soft sombre music) (dog barks) (bell chimes) (soft sombre music) Hello, I've come about the ad in the paper, I'd like to see the room. You're a foreigner? Yes, American. The owner isn't very keen on letting rooms to foreign girls. - Morning. - Morning. What are you doing in Paris? I'm studying medicine at the American hospital in Neuilly. Oh, so you're almost a doctor. Almost, not quite. I must ask you for a favour because if you're going to be here, you can keep an eye on my varicose veins. (footsteps clumping) (woman sighs) The doctor has given me some ointment but that was bad, is it? (footsteps clumping) (woman sighs) At last. (door clicks) Here we are. You ought to see it when it's sunny, it's quite cheerful. (footsteps clumping) You can wash and dress there. (footsteps clumping) And now please come and look over here and you'll see there's plenty of room for your clothes. It's fine. And there is the view over the rooftops for people who like that sort of stuff. - I do. - I don't. I work with my varicose veins and my bad heart, you don't expect me to bring up your letters, do you? It's all right, I get all my mail at the hospital. And what about your young man? I haven't got a young man. (engine roars) (crowd murmurs) We're going for coffee, you coming? - No thanks. - Why not? 'Cause I don't want to, I want to go home, I have to study. (footsteps clumping) (door slams) (Joan chuckles) I'm sorry about this hotel, my God, I didn't know where else to bring you. I think it's wonderful. I didn't know places like this still existed. In Paris, everything exists, now, in America, we'd need two rooms, two suitcases and lots of hypocrisy. Why doesn't this dresser have any shelves? Because nobody's ever used it. (footsteps clumping) (Joan chuckles) What? (bright soft music) (Joan chuckles) Do you believe that chandelier? (bright soft music) (glass chinks) (bright soft music) This must be the only place in the world where you can't do anything, but make love, it's a dream. You're a dream. [Joan] Look how they fit together. - What? - Our hands. (soft music) Is it true what they say at the hospital? That you've been nominated by the French to the Academy of Medicine? That's quite an honour. You'd probably be the first American now. Yes, but I'm gonna write and tell them I can't accept. [Joan] Why? Because I couldn't, that's all. [Joan] Because of what, because of me? Yes. - Ain't I lucky? - Are you, why? Because I waited and I waited to be born just at the right time, for you. (soft music) I never knew loving could be so good and so simple, so soon. (soft music) (footsteps clumping) (bright soft music) (pipe clatters) (sings in foreign language) (bright epic music) French confort. (bright epic music) (water burbles) (engine roars) (door slams) I stopped here because of your concierge. How right you were, she's hopeless. (engine roars) (door slams) I got all dressed up for you today. Don't you think this dress makes me look a lot older? (Harrison laughs) (bright soft music) (engine roars) (bright soft music) Oh! (plate chinks) (birds chirping) Deux monsieur, two please. (birds chirping) (footsteps clumping) Here, you'll be nice and quiet, sir. Thank you. What's the matter with all of them? I've never seen so many teeth. Call me Papa. (birds chirping) (engine roars) (birds chirping) (crowd murmurs) Dessert? - Yes, papa. - What would you like? Une creme, papa. Une creme and I'll have some fraises des Bois. - Papa. - Yes? I'd like some fraises des Bois too, please. I thought I did that quite well. A little much. (birds chirping) - Papa? - Mm? I'm jealous with the way you hold your glass. I guess I'm just mad about you. [Harrison] How shocking. What would they say if I kissed you? On the cheek, nothing. And on the mouth? They'd call the police. I dare you, papa. (wine pours) What's the matter? Did I say something to offend you? Yes. No. A little. (plate chinks) It really a game for you, isn't it? Eat your strawberries. (soft sombre music) [Joan] How fragile it all is. Yes. It's what you said at the restaurant that's between us. Yes. Words stay once they're spoken. (soft sombre music) How can you think it's just a game for me? (soft sombre music) [Harrison] Have you known any boys? Last time you didn't ask. Two. (soft sombre music) Would you rather I'd been a Virgin? Yes. (soft sombre music) [Joan] I'd have been scared and then we'd probably never would have met. [Harrison] Probably. Would you have preferred that? No. (soft sombre music) At my age, everything counts so terribly, it's not as though it's fun, (soft sombre music) That's why it was wrong for you to say that, that's why it hurt me. That's right. At my age, it's fun. We put on weight and take everything lightly. At my age, we build and each important moment is a stone. You're one of my stones. A very long time from now when I'm an old woman with children and grandchildren, and you'll have been dead for years and years, you'll still be one of my stones. (soft suspenseful music) I can't see you anymore in places like this. Can I come to your room? No, it's too ugly, I'd be ashamed, besides my concierge wouldn't understand. Then we'll just have to go to the country. We couldn't, could we? (waves rumbling) (bright soft music) I won. - You cheated. - No, I didn't. All right, come on, let's do that again, ready? (bright soft music) (waves rumbling) Go, go. (bright soft music) - Yeah, I won. - You cheated. Come on, we'll start again, are you ready? (bright soft music) (waves rumbling) (bright soft music) (birds cawing) (bright soft music) (waves rumbling) - You won. - (both laughing) I won a heart attack, that's what I won, you're the one who's 22. Anyway, you cheated, I saw you, you had one foot over the line. Of course, I always cheat, a little, I have to win. You're terrible. (bright soft music) (waves rumbling) (crowd murmurs) (footsteps clumping) (crowd murmurs) You think she's his secretary? - What's it to you? - Well, he's wearing a ring, she's not. (utensils chinking) He's old enough to be her father. Now, if anybody propose something like that to me. But they want what they want, so? Soon we'll be back in Paris, here, everything's so simple, it's only other people who complicate things. (footsteps clumping) (utensils clatters) Oh, excuse me, Mademoiselle. (footsteps clumping) (seats dragging) (crowd murmurs) (footsteps clumping) (crowd murmurs) (rain burbles) At least she thinks we're nice. Are you coming for a walk with us? Janine, come here. Go on, they're calling you. I only hope that monster doesn't give her a slap she's been dying to give you ever since we got here. Me, what for? - Being happy. - (woman slaps) (footsteps clumping) Do you have any children? Yes, two. (bright soft music) And now, (indistinct). Oh, congratulations and at your age too. Thank you. (footsteps clumping) - Congratulations sir. - Thank you very much. (footsteps clumping) I don't understand. I'm not sure I do. I hope you're happy at least. Yes. (footsteps clumping) 127. (footsteps clumping) (speaks in foreign language) She seemed better, still delirious, then her blood pressure started to drop, she must've taken a whole bottle of pills and then the gas on top of that. (speaks in foreign language) What did she say? [Doctor] It's hard to translate, she jumps words. Typical case, a German or pair girl, naive, who got involved with a much older married man, he dropped her. (speaks in foreign language) (water burbles) (man hums) Hi, congratulations on the academy, I'll clean this up here for you in a minute or you can use that one, I'm going home for lunch today and I wanna make myself nice and pretty. I was up all night on a little escapade, got in at eight this morning, just in time for rounds. Extraordinary girl, picked her up between the cafe floor and the Rumery. Conversation and a grey body. (water burbles) What about you? You're a sly one but we've heard about you. Just a kid too. You be careful now, you know at her age, they still believe in the moon. (man blows) Well, ciao, as the girls say. Say, what if we all went out together some night, the four of us, we'll talk about that, huh? And give my respects to your wife, is she all right? We never see her anymore. (soft sombre music) (water burbles) (men murmuring) (soft sombre music) Mark, let me have a scotch, make it a double, Mark. Thanks, Mark. (men murmuring) Have you got a light? (men murmuring) Can you stay with me for a couple of hours? No, here. I just don't wanna be alone. What are you drinking? Scotch. (men murmuring) (thunder rumbling) What is it? Ms. McLean. Top floor, but it's too late for visits. She's ill and I'm a doctor. This is a respectable house, we told her when she rented the room. Look, here's my card. Oh, you must excuse me, doctor, but with these young girls, you never know. She didn't look so well when she came in, top floor, there's a little cup by the door. (footsteps clumping) (thunder rumbling) (lighter flicks) (Harrison knocking) [Joan] Who is it? It's me. (door clicks) I waited a long time. I'm sorry. I was held up. (soft music) (door clicks) (soft music) My sweet one. (bright soft music) Why are you so serious? (bright soft music) (cart rolling) (bucket clatters) (cart clicks) The ice man. I'll have to go. I told your concierge I was a doctor, she'll never believe I had to stay all night. It doesn't matter now. Is that your father? [Joan] Yes. Why do you turn him away? I didn't want him to see you. [Harrison] And your mother? She understands, women do. What will you do when you become a doctor? Take care of children, I haven't asked you anything yet. I know. It's strange. [Harrison] What? The feeling that you don't wanna touch me anymore, and yet you were so warm and gentle next to me all night. Yes, more than ever before. What happened since yesterday? Nothing. I must've grown old. Tell me really. I watched you sleep just now, with your determined little forehead and even in your sleep, you were building stone by stone. What I don't know, that fragile house where I feel strangely alien, but there are two moments in life I think, one, when you build that house and one when you wonder why it doesn't hold together anymore. They're two separate moments and you must never try to mix them. And yes, they do fit together. They did. (engine roars) [Joan VO] Is it true what they say at the hospital? That the French have nominated you to the Academy of Medicine? It's a great honour, you'll probably be the only American ever. [Harrison VO] Yes but I'm gonna write and tell them I can't accept. [Joan VO] Why? [Harrison VO] Because I couldn't, that's all. [Joan VO] Because of me? [Harrison VO] Yes. (footsteps clumping) Doctor Harrison. (footsteps clumping) We are so very happy to welcome you among us. (sings in foreign language) (bicycle rolling) (sings in foreign language) (dog barks) (sings in foreign language) Thank you. (door clicks) Oh, Mr. Marcel, - you've got your hands full. - Oh, don't even talk about it and you Madame, good hunting today. Turnips, where I come from, we feed them to the pigs. They take... - (luggage clatters) - Oh, sorry. They take everything. An old army friend of mine is a butcher, tomorrow, I bring you a pound of sausage. Oh, Mr. Marcel, you have such connections. All is going well upstairs? Little by little it would be finished in time for Christmas, I hope. I have always liked that room but it's never looked so nice before, I don't know what it is. It's love, Madame, just love. - [Concierge] Oh, Mr. - Marcel, you are so naughty. (footsteps clumping) (door clicks) (toilet flushing) (footsteps clumping) (Marcel knocks) Josette, where are you? (door clicks) (paper rustling) (footsteps clumping) (door clangs) (door slams) (wood clatters) (footsteps clumping) (drapes rustling) (footsteps clumping) Josette! (woman hums) (footsteps clumping) (soft piano music) (woman screams) (soft piano music) Come in. (footsteps clumping) - Oh, darling. - My love. (both kissing) You didn't come so I popped in to see Madame Olga. I was held up, good morning ma'am. We've been amusing ourselves do exercises, do you know my dear man, this child's voice is pure gold, pure gold. I had so many parcels and I couldn't find a taxi, Josette, come and see what I have got for the room. Mr. Marcel, how you spoil the child, we can't wait to see little one, can we? I adore beautiful things, may I come too? Tomorrow, my dear lady, tomorrow. I have so little time this morning. Oh, and actually, you just arrived and you're leaving already? Don't be mean my sweet, you know how difficult it is to get around in Paris since the occupation, - the Germans... - They have taken everything, even our taxis. Ah, yes, and with your wife in Trocadero and your girlfriend in Montmarte, the only women you're spending time with are the ones you see in the metro. No, I don't use the metro, I take those damn velo-taxis everywhere, she's unfair, sorry, really unfair. Off you go to your nest, you little turtle bobs, don't waste your time talking to me and anyway here's Monsieur Grondin for his lesson, come in Monsieur Grondin. Permit me, Monsieur Grondin, Mr. Dutartre-Dubreuil, - Monsieur. - Monsieur and Josette Papillon. Mademoiselle. Good bye. I wish she... (door clicks) I wish wouldn't tell everyone my name. But Marcel, it isn't as if it's well known. It does happen to be in the cement business. It work yet you pay ticket to the opera, that's all they care about. (footsteps clumping) (door clicks) Darling, darling, it's been too long, hasn't it? Yes. And it will be too short as usual. It doesn't hurt if you talk about it. And since you're sure to say it in five minutes, I thought I'd beat you to it. Come, come and see what I have bought for our little nest. Ha ha. Not a clock! Isn't your watch enough? Josette, you're naughty, naughty, naughty, naughty little pussy cat (laughs). - Do you really think she's? - Ravish. And look at the life he leads her, I wouldn't blame her if she looked elsewhere. Neither would I. But no, she's faithful to him. That's all very well for as long as the post pain catalyst structure lasts (laughs). But we all know how long that is, don't we? Oh well, perhaps you don't, but it will be lucky young men who one day. Well, my dearest Grondin, to work. (soft piano music) (clears throat) (sings in foreign language) My sweet, I'm a married man, I have to be careful, I have responsibilities but this evening, we'll have plenty of time. I told her I have a board meeting. So, that means we'll have two hours! Don't exaggerate but we'll certainly have an hour and a quarter. Don't over do it. Oh, you're too sarcastic. And you are too married. (chuckles) Don't tickle. Nah, let's not spoil the little time we have together. Who's is this? And this? Marcel's. And that? Marcel's too. (sings in foreign language) (epic piano music) Who's is this? Marcel's. And this? - Marcel's. - U huh. - And this? - (gasps) No! (footsteps clumping) (Marcel chuckles) (footsteps clumping) Josette, where are you? (footsteps clumping) (Josette moans) I love it when you hold me in your arms, I want to purr like a little cat. (Josette purrs) When I'm with you, I never think of anyone else, it's only when you're not here. Even then, don't think of anyone else. But then you always hold me like this, that way I can't fly away. My little half apple. What! Half apple? I'm I too fat? Of course not, silly, Plato said that. Plato? Yes, a Greek philosopher. He said we are each of us half an apple and when we find our other half, we finally become a whole apple and nothing can separate us again. That's nice, that story, but what if one half apple is married to a whole thin cucumber? No, Josette, that's not the, - oh, my God! - Huh? A quarter to. I have got an important guest for lunch at home, I'll see you tonight, we'll have lots of time. Be true to me till then. - I'll try. - (footsteps clumping) (bright epic music) (bell chimes) (door clicks) (door slams) (footsteps clumping) [Mrs. Marcel] Would you like half my apple? Good god, no! No, I mean, I mean, no, thank you, my dear. You see what I mean, Leonard? He's hardly finished his lunch and off he's again. How many hours do you think he has given me this week? 17. Did you count them? [Mrs. Marcel] It's all written down in my diary. [Marcel] And what about at night time? I'm here every night. [Mrs. Marcel] The nights. You know what he does at night the minute we go to bed? He reads the memoirs of Saint-Simon and there are 52 volumes. Good stuff. Have you re-read them lately? 52 Volumes, you could go mad. Coffee is ready, Madame. (footsteps clumping) Oh my God, forgive me if I have mine now but I have got an appointment at the office, please. Look at him. I give you the benefit of the doubt, I call it an hour and a quarter. No, this is a ridiculous, really. A telephone call, Monsieur, from Madame, your mother. And now his mother, that's all we need. Leontina, brings some hot water and a towel to clean Monsieur's trousers. No, don't bother, I will go to the kitchen. No, you won't, she'll do it here. (footsteps clumping) That girl is much too pretty, - I'll have to replace her. - Heloise, you worry too much. One has to think of everything, and now his mother. Six months since your poor father died and I'm alone in this big house, you never come to see me, never, I might as well be dead too. But mama, I saw you on Wednesday. And do you know what today is? Monday? It happens to be Tuesday, is it too much to ask that I see my son once a week? Of course not mama but I've been busy at the office and... I need you, Marcel. I have terrible problems, there's a plumber who's given me a ridiculous estimate for fixing the shower, I must give him an answer tomorrow at the latest so, I'm counting on you to be here at six o'clock. Not, this evening, mama. Whatever it is, your mother comes first. Oh, Kipi, darling. (cat meows) Oh, Kipi, my little (mumbles). Good bye, I must dash. Well, me too. (door slams) My dear, Leonard, you are his friend and you always take his side, but maybe you're right, perhaps I don't make enough fuss over him. - You know what I'll do? - Yeah. I shan't say a word, but just turn up at his office at six and we can walk back home together like two young lovers. It's a very good idea. But you must consider that the last year's figures are higher than these, what will the company do about it? [Man] Even with the war, we can surely do better. I agree, I think we could get more business in the north. I have a contact there, you know him, George Delia. Oh yes, oh yes, George Delia (mumbles). He said he'd be here at six and he wouldn't have to hurry back home. Shall I tell you something? When I was young, I was a very gay girl and all of us in opera led, thank you, what we call the Bohemian life, but I had one strict rule, I never took up with a married man. You know why? A girl can let her life pass-by waiting for him. No, you are... There's my phone. (phone ringing) Come, it may be for you. (phone ringing) Be patient, I'll get rid of them in no time. But lumpkins, my pigeon, my pussy cat, don't be such a grumpy little bear. I think he must have a private zoo over there. (men laughing) (bell chimes) (phone clicks) (phone rings) Have the goodness to tell Mr. Dutartre-Dubreuil that his mother is waiting for him. Yes, Madame. (door clicks) Could you tell Mr. Dutartre-Dubreuil that his wife is waiting for him. Yes, Madame. A moment, please. (phone buzzing) Your... (clock ticking) (Josette sniffles) (portrait clatters) (birds chirping) (bright epic music) (bell chimes) (man panting) (birds chirping) (man groans) (birds chirping) (bell chimes) At last. You tell me you want to see me urgently as if it were a matter of life or death. You make a rendezvous in in the Bois the Boulogne and I have to go across Paris to get here, have you gone mad Leonard, you know my problems? I'm always late for everything as it is without to making me later. A little fresh air is good for you. I don't give a damn about my own health. Anyway, I'm supposed to be with Josette in half an hour. Don't fly off the handle, Marcel. (water burbles) (birds chirping) Here, no one can eavesdrop, but it is a matter of life and death and not just yours or mine, but our country's. [Marcel] Go on. Well, I didn't talk to you before because I must admit the resistance movement was a bit of a terrorism at first, but now we have regular contact with London and we've thought of you. In your position and with your company's contacts with the Germans, you could play an important part. Think it over carefully my friend, it's a serious step to take, I mean, we are all free to choose. It's a question of time, how to fit everything in? - Already, I'm... - It's a problem we all face but I know your difficulty, even this could make your life easier, can't you see? Item one, your wife is very prodigal, isn't she? (Leonard chuckles) I have underestimated you. (laughs) Forgive me, Leonard, you're a genius, can you pass me those oars, I am going into trim. (bright epic music) No, no cheese, thank you. Nine o'clock, I'm sorry my love but I have to leave you again. Be careful my dear. Have no fear. I listen to the gentlemen on the radio. Keep it low, who knows? The Germans are everywhere. We'll get them, take my word. (Heloise chewing) (Josette chuckles) - Who's is this? - Marcel's. - And this? - Marcel's. And this? (laughs) Marcel's. How did you do it? Love finds a way. I think you're wonderful. Who's is this? Marcel's and for the whole evening. ♪ And darkness was upon the face ♪ ♪ Of the deep and the spirit ♪ ♪ Of God ♪ (phone rings) ♪ Moved upon the face ♪ ♪ Of the waters ♪ ♪ And God said ♪ - ♪ Let there be light ♪ - Hello. I would like to speak to Marcel Dutartre-Dubreuil. - To Mr. Marcel. - Oh. Yes, he's there but. I didn't like to disturb him. Tell him it's his friend Leonard and that the business is urgent. You could at least tell me why you have to rush off just because of the telephone call. Who is this Leonard? You sure it's not Leonora? Quite sure. If you must know, he was in command of my unit during the war. So what, the war is over. Not quite, darling. I hate you. I hate you. I should be unfaithful, you're driving me to it. I shall, I shall, I shall, (crying). (door slams) There, we will have a nice cup of tea just the three of us. A true English tea. The (speaks in foreign language) And the first flow give it to me, he's so sophisticated. And now Monsieur Grondin, we must cheer up this little girl, she's left too much on her own. How difficult it is to believe that the young lady so pretty, - how anyone... - Monsieur Grondin, please, we all know you have charm, but don't overplay your Don Juan. Leonard, life is absurd. Things are not going well with Josette? Worse, they're going to well, I think I love her. But that should make you happy, it's a season of good cheer. That's just it, Christmas eve, for me it's a nightmare, Heloise naturally expects me to be with her, my mother will be furious if I don't go to her house and Josette. She won't be with her family? She has none, she's alone here, which leaves me exactly eight days to find a solution. (water burbles) Look, I didn't want to say anything yet, nothing is sure but the information you've supplied seems important enough to London for them to want you to go there and report personally. When? I don't know, perhaps at the Christmas. - Christmas? - (shivering) (soft Christmas music) (bell chimes) Oh! Hey. (soft Christmas music) (bell chimes) - Good afternoon, Madame. - Good afternoon. Have you any handbags? For you Mr. Dutartre-Dubreuiil, yes. Perfect! I can see that you have good taste Madame, I'm in a hurry and I needn't look further, I will have this model. Thank you, Monsieur. - With that be all? - Yes. Oh no, no, I'd have two more, just like that. Just like this? No, no, let me think, - if you have it in red, yes? - Oh, yes, yes. Fine, it will do for a younger lady and one in black kid for an older one. As you wish, Monsieur, but if the ladies would meet. God forbid. Charming, I had nothing wheely fixed for Christmas eve. Well then, that's fine, it's settled. Forgive me but I am in a rush, I'll take care of everything, champagne, oysters, turkeys, the tree. And I'll provide the guests. That's I, the important thing is that it's fun for Josette. Oh, it will be such fun, I've asked all my older champs from the opera. Fine, here is the tree. - Good bye. - Thank you so much. (machine glides) You really can't leave your poor mother alone for Christmas. There was no question of that mama, of course, you would spend Christmas with us. Yes. You inflict your mother on me? She just telephoned nasty as ever, the one night we could be alone together and you do this to me. What else can we do? It's her first Christmas since my father died. Do you think I'd want to go out and celebrate the first year you died? I didn't expect her to jump for joy when I told her, but do you know what she said? No, mother, I don't know what she said but I bet you're going to tell me. [Mme] She said that... I would like to speak to Marcel Dutartre-Dubreuil, the Archbishop has beaten the clock twice. We've just heard from the general about your departure to London, you will leave on Christmas night disguised as a butcher - with a cow, understood? - Yes. [Leonard] Don't forget, Christmas night. Hold on, please. I don't want a Christmas tree or your presents, or all of those old folks of Madame Olga, I just want some fun. Perhaps you might be feeling a bit alone that night far from your loved ones. I wouldn't be the way Madame, with all my heart. A war is horrible but we must forget our little differences that night. - Of course. - Don't you think? Of course, Madame. (door clicks) Come on, my dear, we will give you a little party, you will see how good it will be? There is nothing gayer than singles, the other old man who likes music is going to play us a little Schumann and then there is Monsieur Grondin. No, admit it, you know you like him, Monsieur Grondin. Good, another time. Thanks, George. (footsteps clumping) Goodbye Marcel a nice Christmas and don't work late. - Good night, Marcel. - Good night, George. (paper rustling) These are the last, Monsieur, (speaks in foreign language) And here are the receipts and your change. Thank you, thank you Mademoiselle, you must go home now. Will you be able to manage by yourself? Oh, yes, yes, I ordered three little taxis. I hope you will have a very happy Christmas, - good night, Monsieur. - Good night. (phone rings) Damn, damn, damn, damn! Mr. Dutartre-Dubreuil is not here! What do you mean you're not there? It's me, Leonard. It is very important I see you tomorrow, the Archbishop has beaten the clock twice. (phone clatters) (bell chimes) [Maid] Merry Christmas, Madame. (bell chimes) (footsteps clumping) Good morning, mother, I'm delighted you could join us today. So am I. (bright epic music) (bag clatters) (bright epic music) A dream a dream, tonight you must be a dream. Is she a dream? You mustn't let all these go to waste. I had a faithful nature too my dear, but enough is enough, and when a man does what he's doing. Josette. Santa Claus! My dear friend, we were just talking about you. (glass chinks) [Mme] When he was little, my son was always on time. That's really the end! Are you implying that I'm the one who taught him to be late? I'm simply stating that while he lived with me, he never kept his mother waiting. (bright epic music) I'm late, can't you go a little faster, please? You're not in a horse. (bright epic music) Alt. Up here. (bright drum music) Allez. (engine roars) (door clicks) (bell chimes) (footsteps clumping) (bicycle glides) (bell chimes) (footsteps clumping) (bell chimes) Mama, why aren't you upstairs? I was, - your wife drove me away. - Oh no, no, can't you make a truce for Christmas, the English and the Germans have. Never! After her behaviour, I would rather spend Christmas by myself. No, no, please mother, come. (bright epic music) (bicycle glides) (bright epic music) (footsteps clumping) (engine roars) Thank you. (footsteps clumping) No, you didn't have to come, my son. Oh, mama. I could have cooked myself some noodles. (door creaks) I have no appetite for food these days. - A woman alone... - Nonsense mama, with these oysters and fois gras, we'll have a nice little Christmas luncheon, just the two of us. I'll go home again much later. (soft music) (glass chinks) Oh, my child, come on, eat your oysters. Your mother's the last to be dodged, six will be enough for me. But mama, I bought six dozen. Eat my son, eat. Nothing gives more pleasure to a mother's heart than to see her child eat. (wine burbles) (utensils chinks) (bell chimes) (glass chinks) Upsetting, most upsetting. Its a final insult, he keeps us waiting here while he takes the old cow out to lunch. No, no, my friend, I tell you this is too much. And all these oysters getting warm. Four dozen. Four dozen? - The last one. - No. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes;, to please your mother. (cat meows) (bright epic music) Here, these oysters are quite special, well worth waiting for. Here, here. Marcel doesn't seem to think so, but that's because I got them for him. [Marcel] Oh, please, please Heloise, not today, show a little generosity, please. Generosity? Four dozen oysters? Leonard, I'll ask you, is that mean? Here, here, eat your filth, I'll show you generosity. [Marcel] No! [Heloise] Take them out, I don't want any. Keep them yourself, I have had enough. [Heloise] Did you hear him? (utensils clatters) I'm the one who's had enough, this is Christmas and this is the way he behaves. Come on, Marcel, be sensible. Don't, don't forget, the Archbishop has beaten the clock, twice. What do you mean the Archbishop? Who's beaten what clock? I see you're making fun of me in your stupid private language. You will drive me mad, both of you. The Archbishop has bitten the clock, my God! Mother, mother, I wish I was dead. (footsteps clumping) (door slams) Do you mean you would go out without saying goodbye to her? Well, I'll do it for you. Don't forget, (door clicks) - In two hours from now... - Josette's the one I've got to say goodbye to, when it's time, come and fetch me there. Don't forget. (door slams) (bright epic music) Well, who would have thought it? Thought what? (bright epic music) That you could play like that, you always seem so selfish. You haven't seen anything yet. (bright epic music) (bright soft music) Some more of this beautiful champagne Oberleutnant? (soft piano music) Thank you. Enjoy the champagne, but would you, war is war. In half, it was I never got a bigger one in his life. (all laughing) Some more champagne, Cusigin? I was just about to propose the same (laughs). (sings in foreign language) (Olga screams) He's here. He is here. My dear friend, we thought you were never coming. Come, come, let me introduce you. But Josette? Oh, she's next door, she's dancing in your room with youngsters. Just listening to her and you thought you'll have a lonely Christmas day, she's having a mad time but let me introduce you. Madame Bala Dimitriev. (bright soft music) (Josette laughs) - Good evening, Marcel. - Good evening (mumbles). Julius Qutrapigan of the (speaks in foreign language). (bright epic music) (trumpet music) (crowd applauds) (sings in foreign language) - [All] Bravo. - (crowd applauds) Bravo, bravo, and now Mr. Marcel and now the beautiful and disturbing (speaks in foreign language) Who was and remains one of our great prima ballerinas. Marcel, your party is quite delicious but we've had far too much to drink, I'm afraid we're all as drunk as pools. Not in front of Oberleutnant, remember, you promised not to talk politics. And now Mr. Marcel you must eat - first a little something. - No, no, really. I am honoured dear sir, to be your guest. Surprise, we saved his oysters, we didn't forget him now, did we? No, my dear lady, I've already had. No pass, the little one thought of it herself, she kept some saved for you and it wasn't easy with all these big, strong men (laughs), now there, a nice fat oyster and who's is this nice fat oyster? - [All] Marcel's. - (all laughing) And all for all these ladies. - No, no. - Can any man refuse anything served with such lovely hands? (all laughing) (sings in foreign language) (footsteps clumping) (cock crows) (cow mows) (footsteps clumping) There's good ideas in London, we won't run into a single threat. (cow mows) The pass is made out for two, you see. A butcher and his helper. Stick a blouse on him and I drop him off at the air strip - fresh as a Daisy. - Poor, Marcel, what a Christmas day. For all of us. (bright soft music) Oh, darling, there you are. I thought you weren't coming. I told you I would. Monsieur Grondin was teaching me the slow. Is that what he's teaching you? We'll just finish this one. You didn't mind, do you, darling? Have you had your oysters? They were keeping them for you. Yes, I've had my oysters. (bright soft music) (engine roars) (cow mows) (door slams) (sings in foreign language) Are you sure this is it? - It should be here. - (sings in foreign language) This can't be here, listen to that. (sings in foreign language) It's a whole nest of Germans, let's go downstairs, we're gonna wait for him there. (footsteps clumping) (sings in foreign language) Excuse me, I don't feel very well. (sings in foreign language) (audience applauds) Thank you, thank you all. You are too kind. My dear friend, long live them both wine and song. And love, dear lady. Long live love. (audience applauds) (footsteps clumping) (water burbles) Here, drink this, it will make you feel better. (Marcel sighs) Oh, you never could behave like other people, hence being sick on Christmas day. Don't be cross with me, Josette, not this evening. Who says I'm cross with you? But it's true, isn't it? We were all enjoying ourselves and as soon as you come, everything goes wrong. I'm sorry, I have just had too many oysters, that's all, but it was a nice party and you did have some fun. You see, I keep thinking that no matter what I do, I don't really succeed. I tried, though, I did try. Hurry up, Josette, there's more to drink next door, are you coming? Coming? - Josette. - What now? I was really in love with you. I love you too, silly. When you feel better, come and dance with us. Get some sleep, mm. Close your eyes. (footsteps clumping) (crowd murmurs) (door creaks) (dog barks) Goodbye Marcel and good luck. Thanks, old man. (cow mows) (doors slamming) (engine roars) Some Christmas day, huh (laughs) And think of the rest of Paris, all of them with their feet under the table. Cigar? (engine roars) (cow mows) (engine roars) You know what we ought to do when we get there? We're early, so. I know a little bistro near the airstrip which stays open all night, we have to go in there, the two of us while we are waiting and have a dinner on a dozen oysters.
