Where is the waterfall? I can't see it. That's why they call it magic. So, close your eyes. Close your eyes and count to ten. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Give me two Henney. Just Henny on the rocks. Guy, calm down now. Guy, relax, now. Relax! - Hey! Those two shots of Henney, how much? - Ten thousand. - Say what? - Ten thousand naira. Hey! Chi! - Chi! - Nnamdi! How are you? Oh, my...! Yeah, I'll catch up with you guys. - Look at you! - What's been up with you? - School. - Mm-hm? Yeah, you know, I did my masters, and I work with Access Bank now. - What about you? - Well, I'm into advertising now. I used to work with JJW, but I left them. Now I have started an agency of my own. And, uh... tomorrow's a big day! You know? I'm signing my first major client tomorrow. Wow! You must be super excited. I'm excited! - Congratulations. - Chioma! - Come here! - I'm coming. - I need to go with my girlfriend. - Oh, sure! - All right. - Really nice to see. - Take care of yourself. - All right. We used to go to school together. Uni. I used to help her do assignments. Shut up, now. Relax. Hold on. - This is my VIP. - But we are with them. They're already in already. This is my VIP. You can't go in. - Calm down, now. - Leave this place. This is my VIP. You can't go in. Guy, what is your problem? I'll deflate your body so it looks like a sign board. Look, I brought thugs here. Guy, deal with him. What did you say? You can't talk like that. Come on, leave. Leave. Touch me one more time now. Touch me again! - What rubbish! - You're stupid! - Is that you? - Yes, it is me. You are quite scarce around here these days. I have a lot of work. The world is moving away from traditional media. New media, it is, and even more now so, about direct engagement. Stupid. Jesus! New media, that has got to be the boss. This is the direction that Infinite Ideas intends to take SoftMoney. We start off by harnessing the full power of social media by creating a special experimental campaign. Leveraging the offerings, the fantastic offerings and products of our company. Our billings are in no way comparable to that of JJW! You will have no regrets coming with us. - You got this, bro. - Let's go Good morning. How's everything? Eh, Mama Ibeji! Mama Ibeji! Give me the akara. We will see later. I got a big day. What's up? Let's go. - Twenty billion dollars in the kitty. - Absolutely easy! Nnamdi. You think you're smart, huh? In this business, you must learn to pay your dues. It's a dog-eat-dog world, and we eat puppies like you for lunch. Always jumping the gun, Nnamdi. Oh, boy, you truly show yourself. Uh, sorry. Excuse me? Did they just come out of a meeting with Timi and Jaye? Yes. Is there a problem? Excuse me? Excuse me, sir? You cannot go inside. Hello? Excuse me, sir, my job, please! You cannot go inside. - You cannot go inside. - Grace. - It's all right, Grace. Please excuse us. - What's going on, now? Don't tell me those guys got you to change your mind? We talked about this. See... Uh, I've done the work. I've done the work, and it's brilliant, even if I say so myself. Uh, uh, uh, Nnamdi, we are so sorry. Um, actually, they made us tie-in offers that we just couldn't refuse. This is madness. It's just business, Nnamdi. So... what should I do now? Hmm? Because the only reason why I quit my job at JJW in the first place was because SoftMoney was supposed to be my first client. - We shook hands on this. - Nnamdi, you are a brilliant young man. I'm sure you know that. There'll be many other opportunities for you out there. It's not the end of the world. Yeah, just... just man up, and you know... Better things in the... in the future... - How could you? - What the... - How could you? - No, no, no, no! - How could you? - Nnamdi, calm down! - Hey! - How could you? - No, no, no, no! - You're wicked! - Calm down! - You're very wicked! You're wicked! How could you? Same shit. Different toilet. My guy, I told you, people's behavior can be very ugly. I was the one that handled the account at JW. - I know. - And they were being ripped off. And they were not happy about it. So, when they got $9 million from the venture capitalist people, they were going to shop for a new agency. - I said shop, guy, for now. - Yes. When I took the initiative, I approached them. - I'm not in Lagos for leisure. - Not at all. I said, "Listen", guys, I manage the account. I know the account inside out, - "so let me just leave these people." - Yes, yes, yes, yes. "And start my own agency, and you will come with me as my first clients." They agreed! They bought the idea! Hell, they even encouraged it! - Bastards! - Criminals! - Mad people. - Stupid people. - Useless people. - Nonsense people. Chai! They even just got $9 million! Ha! Look at how you are mentioning this money. When mentioning this kind of money, call it with dignity. Call it with respect, my friend. Call it with reverence. Nine... million... dollars. You truly do pass yourself. Anyway, forget that one. Are you still traveling tomorrow? As early as possible, see bus, see Nnamdi. And it's off to the East. Brother! Brother! Brother! What's up with that? What is this guy's problem? Guy, can't you see? Sorry, boys. I didn't see you guys there. How would you see us when you are driving a big car? Brother, this is the G63. That's a heavy machine you've got, my brother. - I see you know your cars. - Definitely now. This is a 3,0-ton SUV, eh? Takes off from rest to 60 mph in just 5,1 seconds. Shows that good things are coming. - See you around. - All right. - Take care. - Well done, sir. Don't you know that's my dream car? Something on your lips, clean it. No, here. - The center. - What is it? Shit. From when you were kissing ass. - Toby, me? - Shit, clean it off. OK, that's enough, that's enough! Mama! The lady has a big foot. When she sets foot in my shop, things disappear. - Hm. - But I'll set a trap for her. If she steps into my shop again, I will sweep her out with a broom. Take your feet off. I'm talking about a lady with fat feet and you're putting your legs up! - Enough. - Stop telling me enough. How many years, and you keep doing the same thing! - Enough. - Leave that matter. Mama. Tell him. He is your father. If you ignore him, there won't be space for anything but his legs. Ay! It's good to have you back, my son, job or no job, OK? Papa, I started my own company. - What did you say? - I started my own company. Infinite Ideas. Infinite Ideas. Infinite Ideas. So, how is that going now? It's not so easy but we are doing it. You see? You see what I said? I still cannot understand why you left your job to start your own company. And the job was paying so well. Even Toby here was saying that you tried to steal one of their clients. Papa, I never said anything like that, though. - Well, that's what it boils down to. - Papa, I didn't steal anybody's clients. I only saw an opportunity, and I took it. Uh-uh. That is where that's landed you now. And now you cannot go back. Take it easy, easy now. It's not a child you are talking to. You forgot how he was complaining bitterly - and blaming God for neglecting him. - Oh. It took him five years after graduation to find a job. Now he got a job, and under one year, he just threw it away. Huh? You do pass yourself, sir. Papa, nobody ever gives an entrepreneur a chance until they begin to make it. - Ah. So, you are now an entrepreneur. - Yeah. That's what I am, Papa. Anybody that runs a business is an entrepreneur. So, Obioma selling recharge cards is an entrepreneur? Leave him alone. He has just come back. Hm. Mr. Entrepreneur. I'm glad you're back. I'm happy both my sons are here for Thanksgiving. Greetings and felicitations. Come and take your mum's bag. I'm really sorry. My dear, you're leaving already? You don't want to greet me and my husband? We're hurrying home because we have a meeting later this evening. Do you ever rest? Even the Lord rested on Sunday. Pascal, Pascal! You are aging well. You look good. How are you doing? Hey! Are those Toby and Nnamdi? My God! Come, come, come! Come and greet me properly. Nnamdi! Look how big these kids have grown! He is such a handsome young man. - And a charming smile. - Just like Andy's. - Ooh! - Sorry, Ma. You know my biological father? Nnamdi? Nnamdi? Come on, let's go, let's go. - How do you know my father? - Um... That will be a story for another day, OK? - Are you working now? - Yes, Ma. - I run an advertising company in Lagos. - Oh, my God! Your son is in Lagos and you didn't tell me? You should be ashamed of yourself. It's you who should be ashamed. Look, Nnamdi, come and see Chief, so that he helps you grow your business. Get his number from Obinna. Give Obinna your number, so you both can connect on WhatsApp and Facebook. - Yes, Ma. - Don't "Ma" me. - Call me Auntie. - OK. Auntie. Yeah! I'm on Facebook. Send me a message later. All right, Ma. You have been keeping secrets from this boy? You and your husband are experts in keeping secrets. - Hey! - Stay away from this boy. Have a good day. Gossip monger! So, you still gossip? Chai! Please, I have a question. Who was that woman we greeted in church, and how does she know my dad? Leave that alone. It doesn't concern you. Daddy, how do you mean, it doesn't concern me? Son, just disregard it. Let everything that bites at night be termed "mosquito." Disregard it, please. Mummy, what's the meaning of what you said just now? Please, leave it alone. What? Eh? What? Every time I ask about him... you tell me either that he died or he abandoned my mother and I before I was born. Eh? Nobody wants to talk about him. Please, what's the real story here now? OK, when I return to Lagos, I will go and pay Auntie Nneka a visit. Do you want to kill us? What kind of thing is this? You will do no such thing. Nobody in my household will ever be associated with ritualists! Ritualists? It's 2018! So long as you live under my roof, you will have nothing to do with that man. You will not bring shame onto my good name. I will not allow it. My wife tells me you are into advertising and marketing. Yes, sir. You know I have friends in high places that can help you? Make you madly successful. Yes, sir. I'm sure you do, sir. How desperate are you for success? Very desperate, sir. You must be strong. Strong as a lion. Now... kiss the lion. Kiss the lion. Sir? Kiss the lion's head. I'm in deep shit. Please, come. Come, come, please. I nearly shit myself here. Ay! This man will kill you. I know. This man will use you for pepper soup tomorrow morning. You are finished. Are you trying to make me feel worse? Because you're succeeding. Jesus Christ! Toby, were you and Chichi at it while you were driving? I let her drive. - What? - She said she could drive. And you believed her? Obviously! Come, come. Where are you going? - To call Daddy now. - But why? Why now? So, he can see how dumb his son is, dumb enough to use his father's 190 to run around with cheap girls. Chichi's not just any girl. - I'm just playing with you. - Get away, idiot! Which one of you idiots did this? We all know your mother and I did not go out last night! It has to be one or both of you! What kind of thing is this? Don't you hear me? Who did this? Which one of you idiots did this? Who did this? Will you come out! - Papa, good morning. - It was me. I don't know why you can't get this together. Huh? We have always tried to be a good mentor to you. And always tried to bring you up the right way. And you always find a new way to disappoint your mother and I! Do you knew how long I've got this car? To you, it's just a Mercedes-Benz 190 padded. But don't forget, it is the blood and sweat of your mother and I! Keep this in mind. Keep this in mind when next you decide to go on a drunken spree! - Get out of here! - What kind of nonsense is this? Nnamdi, why? Please, please, please! As if you haven't done enough already, and now this! Why, now? Come, guy, why did...? We all know how this would've killed Mama mostly. Her perfect son. Her perfect son. The son she boasts about. The one that just got a job at the Ministry of Justice. No, now. Do you want her to have a heart attack? Besides, whatever you go through, I go through it as well. You didn't bash the car. We did. Nnamdi Okeke. Nnamdi Okeke. You must make it in this life. - Sir, Auntie said you can come inside. - Yes. - Ah, Nnamdi! Welcome. - Good afternoon, Ma. Hope it wasn't difficult to find. - No, Ma. - Oh, that's very good. Thank you for allowing me to visit, Ma. Oh, please, I told you to call me Auntie Nneka. Sorry, Auntie. Welcome. Thank you, Ma. Thank you, Auntie. You're welcome. - You know my son Obinna? - I know you from somewhere. Uh-uh. Oh! Oh! The G-Wagon expert, now. Oh! That was you! Oh, really? No. Welcome. - Thank you, sir. - You're welcome. - Obinna? - Huh? - What is it? - Nothing. Something just got in my eye. - Oh. - Sorry, welcome. What brings you to Lagos? - I live in Lagos. - Ah, OK. Please sit. - Welcome. - Thank you, Ma. This is Zion Rail Network. That is obviously our graphic. And yes, that's your graphic. I pulled it straight from your website. OK. When you look at this, what do you think of? A heart. Yeah. A heart. Anything else? OK. Check this. This is the palm of my hand. Just like yours, if you wish to take a look. These lines are train tracks. They are all connected, leading somewhere, taking you wherever you need to be. So, I would say that Zion Rail Network is in the palm of your hands. Please, sit down, guys. Sit down. I love it. Brilliant! "In the palm of your hands." Absolutely brilliant! And who might you be, young man? Uh, that's Nnamdi Okeke. The young man my father spoke of. Ah! My name is Richard. Richard Williams. I love it. Absolutely. I think it's ingenious. Go with this "in your palm" thing. I wanna see it. I wanna hold it. In my palm. Make sure you work on it, right? Right away, sir. All right, guys. Get back to work. I can see you love your cars. Good afternoon, sir. Um... I have always loved cars since I was a child, sir. You wanna drive? Give it a shot. Let me show you how to drop the top, yeah? What I really like about this, there's something about it so exotic. Let's go. Is this how you wanna drive this car? Crawling like a snail? It's a Ferrari. It was built for speed. - Step on it, bro. - OK. - Faster! - Oh, my God! I-I'm sorry, sir. - You're sorry? - I'm just scared. Never apologize for being alive. Never be scared. Take the bull by the fucking horns and you move the frickin' car. Step on it. Yeah! That's what I'm talking about! Whoo-hoo! Twenty-seventh. Twenty-seventh. March 14th.

You are always posting on my blog. Your blog? Yes. The... OK, OK. I am Uzoma. - OK. OK. - Yeah. OK. Then how did you find me? Your IP address. IP what? OK, OK, OK, how did you know it was me? The parables were a dead giveaway. And most of my readers, they are, you know, of a younger demographic. I mean, no offense. Yeah, so whenever I see someone, you know, quote old, wise, proverbial sayings, it catches my attention. You're a smart man. But I'm sure you didn't come here to show me how smart you are, obviously. Andy... I need your help. What do you know about Richard Williams? Enough to know that a toddler like you is digging his early grave. All right. I have something for you. What is it? - Hm-hm. What is that? - Look at it. The resemblance. That's Nnamdi. Your son. My friend... My son, how possible? All I can say is that he grew up in Owerri, with the Nwories. Yeah. Pascal and Eunice Nworie. Eunice! Ego's younger sister? Ego was my second wife. How did you know all this? Facebook. - You never knew she had a baby? - No. So... where is she? She died a long time ago. She took ill shortly after she left me. Eunice, her younger sister, wrote me a letter. She made it clear that was... her last words to me because she still believed that I killed her sister. And I never heard about her again. I have a son? I have a son... oh! And now Richard has him. You need to get him out of there before it's too late. You need to help me take down Richard and his brotherhood. The Six. The what? That's what they call themselves. The Six. Richard is... a part of this Six, right? Part of it, you say? He owns it. In the '90s, Omego, Ichie Million, Mike, Paulo, they were in their prime. They kidnapped and killed women and children for money. No one would ever dare question or confront them. But there were whispers. One day, the people of Owerri got fed up with the too-many ritual killings going on. So, they took justice into their hands. And that is what resulted in what is now known as the Otokoto Riots of 1996. Otokoto! I knew it! I knew it! I was on track! Go ahead. The likes of Ichie Million were victims of the jungle justice. But the likes of Omego, Mike fled abroad. Richard Williams gave them safe havens. Wow. That makes sense. Richard Williams is a business tycoon. He's a billionaire. But no one seems to know the source of his seemingly endless wealth, or where he came from. Sorry, sir. Was that Mandarin? Hm? - Sir, Obinna said to come and see you. - Yes, indeed. You all right? I'm OK, sir. Just a little under the weather. Look, I must commend you. You're doing very, very well. You're working really, really hard, and I'm mighty proud of the work you're doing for Zion Rail campaign. Kudos, bro. Kudos. Thank you so much, sir. I wouldn't know how to thank... So, how long has it been now? Funny, right? Funny how time flies when you're having fun, right? Yeah. Ah! Have you heard of Vinoli? - The Cognac? - Amazing! I see the man knows his drinks! Awesome! So, you see, they are moving massively into the African market, and I've asked them to make you their lead agency here in Africa. - Wow! - Mm-hm. - Thank you so much, sir. - You're global now. Thank you, sir. Have you ever been out of the country? Very well. Send a passport to Mirabel, OK? We'll be going to Durban, where you're gonna meet the group MD of Vinoli. Wow! OK, sir. I'll do that right away, sir. - Good. - Thank you, sir. That will be all, Nnamdi. Have a good day. You too, sir. Thank you so much, sir. ♪ Who want it?

Um... this will be very hard to say. - OK. - But... My name is Andy Okeke. And I'm your father. Is this a joke? No, it's not. It's not a joke. It's a long story. I never knew about you. I just found out about you recently. OK. How? Where? From one young man, Uzoma, who runs a blog. He found out that you grew with the Nwories. He knows everything about you, including where you work. And that's the major concern now. - Richard Williams, your boss, is the... - Is the what? I'm sorry to have to cut you short there. But this Uzoma, he put you up to this? No. I know him. Son, I know him well. I used to be a member of a brotherhood before you were born. And before I knew it, I had to pay the greatest price. Merit. My first wife. I had her sacrificed for riches. What? Yeah. That's what they do. They lure you in with the promise of wealth and power. And before you know it, you will have to pay with the life of someone you love. You sacrificed your first wife? I didn't wanna die. I was a coward. You are worse than a coward. You're a murderer! You're not hearing me, Nnamdi. The brotherhood I belonged to is the same Chief Omego belonged to before you were born. Do you know who runs the brotherhood? Your boss, Richard Williams. Oh, come on. That's bullshit. Open your eyes. This is all true. I have contaminated our blood lineage. - But you can correct it, my son. - I'm not your son! A man who uses his wife for a blood sacrifice is not my father! After all this while, you waltz into my office and you're trying to tell me how to run my life? Newsflash, sir. I've been doing very well without you all these years. So, please, leave my office. You're making a mistake, Nnamdi. You are in grave danger. And you don't understand the magnitude of what you are getting into. Please leave. - Here, right? - Yes, sir. - Well, voilà. - Voilà. Thank you so much. Voilà! Big man! Congratulations. Margot, thank you for stopping by. - Thank you so much. - Oh, wow! Steve, thank you so much. - Congratulations. - Congrats! Congratulations. Ha-ha! Look at them! - Nice to see. - Oh, my God! Charles! I want you to meet Nnamdi. He's the new kid on the block. This is Charles. - Oh, wow! Pleasure to meet you, sir. - I've heard of you. - Thank you. - Grow a beard, bro. I have something for you. - You always have something for me. - Exactly. Look at that. - You're a good man. - A-ha. Nice, nice, nice. The best of the best. Monte Cristo. Cuban cigar. You know that deal I spoke to you about the last time, Charles? I have something for you. But give me a second. I'll be right back. Vanessa? Keep my colleagues company, will you? Hello. How are you? - Lost in thoughts? - Yeah. - God is really something, isn't he? - He really is, sir. Yeah. - Having fun? - Oh. The time of my life. You know, you remind me so much of my younger days. I do? You felt you were never really where you were meant to be. Growing up, we always wanted more. I mean, look at this. Look at this house. Look at the sky, the sea. Look at this life. Do you want this life or would you rather the life you were born into? I want this life, sir. And I can give it to you. Everything. You name it. Success. Influence. Power. Everything. I want it, sir. I want it all. But it's not free, my boy. When you take, you give. It's the order of things. Do you understand? Yes. So, are you ready to give what is required for you to have access to opulence and wealth, success and power? And I promise you, it's worth it. I understand, sir. Are you ready to get your key? What key, sir? The key to the good life. The hour of our master is almost upon us. We have a sacrifice and a harvest of souls for his worship. Let the new devotees step forward. We shall partake in the feast of our master after he has tasted and blessed our offerings. Come, O great one! Come, O great one! Come, O mighty one! Come, O mighty one! Come and receive our offerings and the pledge of your new disciples. Do you accept to dedicate your life to the service of the Dark Lord? I do. It's just a dream. It's just a dream. Beautiful lady. Daughter of her father. Land of Owerri, I greet you! Greetings! Greetings! What is making that child cry? Obinna Omego. Obinna Omego. Obinna Omego. You sure know how to put up a show, bro. One can never believe that this is Obinna's third wedding. Can you imagine? Losing your wife is bad enough but to lose your daughter a few years after? I can't even imagine that. Looking at him now, he looks all fine. I can't seem to figure him out. How can you be OK to marry just after seven months of burying your daughter? I'm not talking about Obinna. I'm talking about Nnamdi. Oh. So, what can't you figure out? I don't know what his play is. I mean, the first time he met me, he wouldn't stop looking at me like he just saw Kim Kardashian. After that, he just... fell off the radar. - Maybe he's gay. - Shut up. Or maybe he's looking for a wife. What's that supposed to mean? Ladies. Is it just me or did the two of you get more beautiful in the last 15 minutes? It must be that thing that you're holding in your hands. And you dare offend the gods, huh? - So, Mr. Okeke... - Hm? When are we going on that weekend getaway? You know, the one to Accra? Jesus Christ! Kelly the klutz! Kelly. Um, ladies, it was a pleasure. I'm going to have to excuse myself. Take care. Hey! Did he just...? Did he just pat me on my shoulder? Hello. Hi. Hi, again. - Hi. - I'm Nnamdi. - Kelly. - Pleasure. - OK. - So, what are you going to do? About your broken heel. Oh, uh, stupid thing, I broke it trying to walk. - Sorry. - Yeah. I saw. - Are you stalking me? - No. I'm not. OK. - So, did you drive? - Nope. - Hm. - Yeah. So, how are you gonna get home? I think I'm just going to call a taxi and go. Nah, I could actually drop you off. - If you don't mind. - No, no, no, no, thank you. I don't really know you, so... For all I know, you could be a serial killer that just grabs people, takes them to the forest and just... Never to be seen again. Sorry. Too much crime TV. I'm so sorry. What is it? Are you all right? You speak Igbo? Of course! Where did you think I was from? And we've been sitting here speaking English. You chose to speak English. That's good. OK, do you know what? I'll tell you what. Hm? Since you're not so sure if I'm a crazy psycho person, how about I just sit here with you until you arrange to grab a cab? OK. But wait, where are your friends? I don't want to keep you from them. Yeah, that's true. My friends, my friends... Have you seen my friends? Eh? No. Ah, boy. - Want some? - What's that? Palm wine, freshly tapped. - Hm? - Hm-hm. Hm... Ah, sorry. I'm sure you won't like things like this. Are you serious right now? Gimme that. Mmm! OK. - That's Kelly, yeah? Kelly? - OK. Where have you been all my life? I mean, you're so beautiful, you're down to earth, natural. Like... OK. - Give me your hand. - Why? - Just give me your hand. - For what reason? Give me your hand. - You have not told me why. - I want to check something. OK. Hm... Four. Four what? Four babies, that's the number of children we're gonna have. Two boys. Don't make that face. Two boys, two girls. Perfect family. Yeah, um... They will soon pack us with the chairs. I think we need to go. - Yeah, um... - Uh... I insist. Allow me to drop you off. - Please. - Uh, sure. - Sure? - Sure, sure. OK. Go on, hop in. - Oh, yeah? Is that so? - You have a broken heel. OK. Just... come up, up, up. Hold that. Last one to get to the car is a crazy person! Look at this girl! You can sprint with those legs! Ah, you're not so bad, too. It's been a while, though. My brother and I, we were known for this kind of thing. - Oh, yeah? - Running around everywhere. For nothing. OK. You know, I never pegged you as a G-wag type of guy. - Mm-hm? - Yeah. What kind of guy did you peg me as? - Camry. - Camry? - Yeah. - Ah! OK. What? Camrys are, like, super reliable. No. I, Nnamdi Okeke, is super reliable. OK. Oof! Sorry. Um... - I have all kinds of music. - No, are you kidding me? That's fine. I listen to Oliver De Coque all the time. - You like highlife? - Yes, I do. Listen, if my dad had his way, he'd be one of the Oriental Brothers, and he'd be playing music and he'd be playing highlife. This is my jam. Please, let it play. - Woman, you love highlife music? - Yes, I do. - You speak Igbo. - Yes. You love palm wine. Here, take my heart. Here's the key. I found me a princess! OK. To your house. Oh, hey, baby. How are you? You sure know how to sweep a lady off her feet. Just look at this girl! Yeah. Who said it was me? Nnamdi, be careful. Don't play with me. All right. So, I would love to take you out for dinner tonight. Dinner? I'd love that. Fantastic! Fantastic. So, what's your coordinates? Mm. The '93 Cabaret. Well, aren't you the wine connoisseur? Actually, I'm just a village boy. A village boy at heart. But why at heart? Well, when I first moved here, I realized that to make it, you have to first of all fake it. Yeah, My slogan was, like, "Fake it till you make it." I had to learn the basic table etiquette. I had to improve my culinary palate. I'm just kidding, Culinary palé. You know, just to blend in. I had to do all those things, yeah. Listen... You don't have to fake it with me. OK? How did you... Where did you get all these from? Years, years of research. Asking questions and, you know, breaking into places I clearly shouldn't be in. Um, tracking down commenters on the, you know, internet. And why? - For what? - For justice. I understand. But this is a lifetime of work. You're a very young man. Obviously educated. Why is this so personal to you? No. You don't understand. This... This right here is more important... The question is why? Why is he after you and your son? When you sell your soul to the Devil, he comes after everything. Including lineage. I took an oath on the greed, and now even my offspring suffers. We are running out of time. Is there something you can tell me that will help us pin these guys down? Maybe. It just may be that of one of these is Judas Iscariot. Look, Richard, the truth is... this is not what you told us would happen. It's not. As a matter of fact, it's the exact opposite. The bloggers shouldn't be having a field day. They shouldn't. The information being published is... sensitive. Very sensitive. Only an insider... Chief Mike. I understand your concerns. Chief Omego is running for Governor today, without being jailed by the EFCC. Because of me. When I first met you, you were a billionaire. Selling cars in the East, exotic cars that regular people couldn't afford. Even a toddler could tell that that money didn't add up. EFCC target number one. Now, what I promised to you and fulfilled is legitimacy. All kobo accounted for. We had access to all the powers that be in the country. Security and protection from all angles. I know and I see all things. Now, if you decide that you wanna change your reputation, I suggest you hire a PR firm. And you don't know the person or the people who are involved in this blog? In all honesty, I didn't even look at it. I don't believe I will be affiliated with such. Ah! That's because you were not directly involved. And that's where you're wrong, Richard. That is where you are wrong. Because if we go down, you go down. Oh, yes. I think I know who's behind that blog. - Who? - Andy. I mean, it has to be Andy Okeke. Check this. You told us not to worry about him, that he's not gonna bother us in any way. Now his son pops out of nowhere. Oh, come on. I think his son is a mole. I think you've been watching too many thriller movies, Chief Mike. This is not a conspiracy, you know? There will be blogs and there will be bloggers. And they can only scratch the surface of things. And the minute they start to inch close, I snap their necks. Ta-da! - No way! - Yes way. Oh, my God! - Oliver De Coque. - Hm-hm. Oh! The Warrior and his Oriental Brothers. - Tony Okoroji. - You bought this. Chief Stephen... Osita... Osadebe. What's wrong? It's nothing. Come on. Tell me. What is it? Nnamdi... I don't want to make another mistake. We've been doing this for a while now. I just... I just feel like there's so much about you that I don't know. I don't want to push or intrude or... You know, forget it. Forget it. I just... Don't worry about it. Kelly. Come here. Ask me anything. - Anything? - Hm-hm. Are you sure? You sure? Like this. There she is. OK. Where do I start from? Hm, um... OK, so... Toby is your cousin? And you grew up together? Yes. What about your parents? I started living with the Nwories when I was about five years old. Just after my mum passed. Oh, no. I'm so sorry. And your dad? I don't know. My mother left him and found out later that she was pregnant. I don't think he even knows that I exist. My mother says that he was a bad man. Evil. That was her... way of defining him. You never met him? Something funny happened recently. Not too long ago, a clown came to see me in my office. - A clown? - Yeah. He just sat there and said he was my father. That his name was Pastor Andy Okeke. You know, you just make a little change, and all the scammers come up from everywhere. If this is the same Andy Okeke that preaches against the ritualists and the world of the occult on TV, I don't think he's a fraud. Hm. Come here. Your secret is safe with me. OK? Gosh. You're beautiful. Grant me your wisdom for tomorrow's service. Let my words not be with the enticing words of man's wisdom but in demonstration of your power. God... Andy Okeke. My beloved brother. Begone from me, you devil! For greater is he that is in me than he that is in you. "Whatever is born of God" overcometh the world. And this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith! And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb "and by the word of their testimony." Andy, my brother, you forgot the last part of that quote. "They loved not their lives even in death." But you, Andy, you love your life, don't you? That's why you ran off like a scared little puppy. You're pathetic, Andy. I can smell your fear. But you know what? I can save you. Join the Six, and you can live the rest of your life in dignity. I will never join you... bloodsuckers. - Ouch. You offend me, Andy. Don't you think that's a bit too much of an exaggeration? Mere little droplets here and there. People fail on their promises these days, you know? But you see, the big guy, he's big on promises. God is above him. "Because at the mention of the name of Jesus, every knee shall bow." "Of things in heaven, of things in earth, of things under the earth." But you do know the Greek translation of that, don't you? It says "should bow", not "shall bow", meaning it may or it may not happen. Certainly unsure. Come on, dude, are we gonna spend the whole night quoting Bible verses? Are you gonna join us in this thing or what? That's a reference from The Godfather, in case you missed it, but hey, look, I know, and I totally understand it, OK? There is no doubt about it that preaching is your calling. Let me make you an offer you cannot refuse. I can give you a fleet of churches that would rival any church in the world. I can make you the biggest pastor in the whole of Africa. Hm-hm. All you need do is redo your oath. That's all it takes. And I promise you no more sacrifices. Take my word for it. Brother. Do you know how many pastors come get their powers from us? A lot. I don't care what you say or do to me. I will never bow to you. I rebuke you in the name of Jesus! Depart from me! You worker of iniquity. Blood of Jesus. Blood of Jesus. Blood of Jesus. Blood of Jesus. Blood of Jesus. Blood of Jesus. Blood of Jesus. Blood of Jesus. Blood of Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord. We are victorious. - Jesus! - Nope. Just Richard. - Am I interrupting something? - Uh, no, no, no. Not at all, sir. I just didn't hear you come in, sir. But of course you didn't. You have a beautiful view out here, Nnamdi. The office suits you. Thank you... thank you so much, sir. I owe it all to you, sir. Not at all. Don't thank me. All this is as a result of your work. You worked for it. Have you heard me? I got you a little gift from Switzerland. Wow! This is beautiful, boss. I love it! Thank you so much. Don't thank me. You can thank them yourself when you get to meet them in London to discuss the campaign for Nigeria and South Africa. Um... thank you so much, sir. You are far too kind. I will never know how to repay you. Soon enough, Nnamdi. Soon enough. Good day, Chief. Sit down. I have asked you to see me because my reputation is on the line. You remember I was the one that took you to Richard. I lie? No, sir. So... You won't bring me to disrepute. We are all waiting for you, my friend. We have high hopes for you. Your father, Andy Okeke, had his hesitations. But he paid his debt. As you must yours. But, um... Nnamdi. There's no "but" in this matter. You will be fine. We all did it. And we are all doing fine, too. Nnamdi, you'll be fine. Thank you. I need to pay for something so just wait for me in the car. - All right. - I'll see you. Hey. Oh, wow! That was fast. I did, I did. Thank you. Here. - Hey, bro. - Hey! - Mr. Chuma. - How you doing? How are you now? - How's it been? - Fine. Fine, fine. Listen, um... I know we haven't really talked much. And things are a little awkward because of Kelly. But I just want you to know that, um, I understand everything you're going through. I know it's not easy. But you will be OK in the end. Chuma. - Thank you very much. - No problem. I really, I really appreciate it. Thanks, man. Thank you. - Are you OK? - I'm fine. - It doesn't sound like you're fine. - I'm all right. - You are sure? - Hm. So, since when are you and Chuma buddies? We aren't. Oh, yeah? It didn't look that way from where I was standing. You know this guy is friends with my boss, right? So, Chuma and I cannot have a conversation? Because you guys used to shag. Just wow. Please, I'm sorry, OK? OK? I didn't mean to say it like that. Don't touch me. - Kelly. - Don't you dare touch me. I'm sorry. Something's off. Nnamdi, something's definitely off. I've felt this... this dark cloud hanging above our heads for a while now. I don't like it. I've damn near drove myself insane thinking that maybe it's guilt from my past trying to rob me of my happiness, but it... it just keeps getting heavier and heavier. And I don't like it, Nnamdi. It's suffocating me. This... this whole... secrecy thing. Secrecy? What are you talking about? Don't you dare lie to me! You're hiding something from me, and you know it! You barely sleep. And when you do, you're screaming in your sleep. You think I wouldn't notice that? Do you? Nnamdi... Why won't you let me in? Talk to me. I'm right here. Look at me. Let me in. Why won't you let me in, Nnamdi? Why won't you let me in? Why won't you let me in? Nnamdi, talk to me. Did Richard make you do something? This is not about Richard. It has nothing to do with Richard, but then, who? Who, Nnamdi? What is this about? Kelly, Kelly, just... just drop it, OK? - But, Nnamdi, you're not... - Stop! Nnamdi, you're not talking to me. That's... that's it. Nnamdi, remember this tattoo? I now remember where I've seen that tattoo. That's the same tattoo on Chuma. The same place, same position. Nnamdi, what have you done? Nnamdi, what did you do? Nnamdi, what did you do? What have you done, Nnamdi? What have you done? Nnamdi! Nnamdi, what have you done... - Nnamdi! - Leave me alone! Nnamdi! Nnamdi. This whole... secrecy thing... it's going to kill you. And I'm not gonna let it kill me, too. Goodbye, Nnamdi. If a vulture fails to hover at the end of a sacrifice, you know something obviously has happened in the land of the spirits. Nnamdi Okeke, it is time to hover around your sacrifice. Nnamdi Okeke. You have pledged allegiance to the Dark Lord as your master and savior. And in return, money, influence, and power have been showered upon you. The Dark Lord has blessed you. Now, as a token of appreciation, you shall bring the head of the one you love the most to the Dark Lord and master. If you don't do this, you die. Hello? Hello? Uzoma? Obinna. Did you get that parcel I sent? Yes, I did. It contained a flash. Everything is in there, in the flash. Uzoma, don't tell me to calm down. You don't understand. Hello? Hello? Kosi. Kosi! I'm sorry, Kosi, please! Just let... Stop! Just... Obi? Open up, now. Obinna! Ah, thank God. Obi, I've been looking everywhere for you. - I've been to your house. You're not there. - If it wasn't for PJ... I wouldn't have known where to find you. I need your help. I can't do what they're asking me to do. I can't! Leave me alone! Get away from me! Obinna! Obinna? Obinna! Jesus! Kelly? K... If... if you can hear me, please open up. Please. I'm sorry. Obinna Omego, son of the governor aspirant, Chief Omego, the billionaire, has been confirmed dead. Sources say that he committed suicide as he jumped off from his 18th-floor penthouse apartment. He was thirty... Richard! Richard! Richard! Richard! Yes, Nnamdi? I need to talk to you. Please. Gladly. I'll be right down. Come. Let's go get a drink. You look rather tense. Uh... you... you heard about Obinna? Yes, I did. These things happen. I've always known his was always going to be a short life, anyway. Drink? I... I don't want a drink. I just want to talk to you. Very well. I'll have it. Richard! Ah, my friend, forgive my impudence. Please, come and sit down. God! I haven't come here to sit down. I want out. Out? Out of what, the country? Wow! Marbella is a beautiful place to go at this time of the year. We could get my pilot and then we could all fly down... Out of the Six! I'm done! I never signed up for all of this. All this blood-sacrifice voodoo nonsense! You people did not explain this thing to me properly. I never signed up for this. Nnamdi. Are you sure you never signed up for any of this? Really? You signed up with your soul. "I, Nnamdi Okeke, take the Dark Lord as my master and savior." Remember? Hm? Did you think we were playing here? Hm? OK. - This is no fucking game. - Is that clear? You came to us. You begged for it. You asked for the key, and I gave it to you. Now, it's all about the flashy cars, beautiful, sexy women, and you were lapping it all up like a hungry dog. Now it's time for you to pay back the debt you owe, and you wanna run off? What do you think this is? Huh? Tell me. What, you think you're special? You think you're lucky? Like, there's a fast track, you know, from a mere 5,437-naira account to hundreds of millions of naira in your account, signing up deals all around the world, globetrotting. Well, let me tell you something, Nnamdi. You are special. You know why? Because your blood lineage is part of the brotherhood. Your generations to come are part of the brotherhood. - God forbid! - No, far from it. You're going nowhere. You've got everything you have at a price. Now it's time to pay, and pay you shall. You want me to sacrifice the woman that I love? You want me to bring you the head of an innocent woman! Oh, come on, Nnamdi! Stop being so dramatic. What do you take this for, Nollywood? That's old-school, man. We don't do those things anymore these days. Richard Williams, you're a demon. Please! Listen. You don't have to be scared. Like I said, there's no need chopping anybody's head off. Just bring a name of anyone you love to the altar, that's it. And... it's done. Please. Not her, OK? Please. Take... Take me instead. Please take me instead, please. Nnamdi Okeke. You are not the one I want. Have you heard? The clock is ticking. Tick, tock. Tick... tock. Tick... tock. - Oh. Sister Agnes. - Good evening, Pastor. - How are you? - My girlfriend needs to talk to you. Good evening, sir. Ah, young girl, how are you? - Fine, thank you, sir. - I'm sorry, have we met before? No, sir. How may I help you? Um... it's about your son, Nnamdi. Kelly? Kelly? Kelly! Kelly? Nnamdi. Why? Nnamdi. Toby. I knew you were inside. Jeez, bro, you look like... It smells like shit. What the...? What the hell is going on here? Huh? Oh, my God! Guy, what is happening here? Mummy has been trying to reach you. You're not taking calls. I even called Kelly. Even she doesn't know anything about you either. - And you say you're fine. - Toby, what do you want? Huh? An award? Best Brother in the World goes to Toby Nworie. Is that it? Brother... What is it? Talk to me. Talk to you? Why does everybody keep saying that? "Talk to me, talk to me." What does talking help? What does talking solve? Absolutely nothing! See, Toby, I'm done. OK? I'm done! I'm done. I fucked up, bro. I fucked up. I fucked up, I fucked up. I fucked up big-time. It's OK. Whatever it is, we'll fix it. That's exactly what Kelly said. But nobody can help me! Nobody can! I'm fucked! Fucked. Uh... We'll find a way around it. We'll work things out. OK? It's not the end. Remember. Dad's favorite quote. Um... Come home. Leave all this, all this shit behind. And come home with me. Toby. You don't understand. No matter where I run, no matter where I hide, they will find me. They? The Six. Richard. Richard? As in Richard Williams? Your boss? Toby, it's a long story. Does it look like I have somewhere to go? I need a beer. You want one? Sure. Now, so that's it. I know way too much. That's why they're trying to kill me. And they won't stop until they get me. Bad guys are after you. I get it. So, disappear, now. Huh? Go under the radar for a few months. You can go to Mum's place to seek the consent of a deity. Whatever. Look. I don't know, but somehow, somehow, we will get through this. Remember when... when I bashed Daddy's car? Remember what you told me? You said to me, "What you go through," I go through. You didn't bash the car. "We bashed the car." You're my brother. My blood. Till the very end. Come here. Nnamdi. Wake up. Give me Toby. You know what to do. What's going on, bro? Do it. No. No. Don't do this. I'm your brother. Your blood. The key to the good life. Do it. I said do it. Nnamdi... Nnamdi, you don't have to do this. Do it! No. No! Don't be a coward! Sorry, Toby. But I have to do this. - Come on, bro. - Nnamdi! Do it now! I love you, bro. - Do it now! - Nnamdi, no! No! No! No! Nnamdi? Nnamdi! Nnamdi! In a surprise move by the Nigerian police force, multiple arrests were made this morning after an audio recording confirmed to be the voice of Obinna Omego in his dying moments. Obinna Omego is also a known associate of billionaire tycoon Richard Williams. This audio recording, made by freelance journalist and blogger Uzoma Adibe, has already set social media ablaze, as there are already reports of mob attacks against property and personnel associated with this so-called brotherhood. Well, joining me this morning is Uzoma Adibe, a blogger. - Thank you for coming on. - Thank you very much. I am very happy to be here. Now, according to your report, which you published widely on your blog, this cult group, the Brotherhood of the Six, have been involved in countless murders, some of which are high-profile cases, which is being investigated by the police. But are you not afraid of being sued? Because you did mention some high-profile names here. We are talking about Chief Omego, who is a governorship aspirant, Paul Nwocha, Mbaka, Mike Ekejimbe, and many others. OK, let me quickly come in there. You have mentioned important people's names. Now, let's mention ordinary people's names. Everyday people who have been sacrificed by these bloodthirsty, evil men. When we are done with those, then maybe we can have a serious conversation. It's quite shocking and heartbreaking to believe that this is still happening in this day and age. But there must be, for you, some sense of accomplishment, having finally brought some sort of justice to those who you believe represent and are responsible for your sister's and your niece's deaths. My sister was... Obinna Omego's first wife. They had a daughter together called Kosi. Obinna, in his desire for wealth, and to ingratiate himself to Richard Williams and the brotherhood sacrificed both of them. And as you already know, he confessed this to me before he was killed. Good news. Nnamdi's awake now. Please come with me. But the report stated that he died from injuries sustained... Oh, Nnamdi! Hey, let him breathe. Sorry. Dad... I'm sorry, Dad. It's OK. OK? I swear. Hm? - I'm sorry. - It's fine. It's OK. Tobes. So, now, what's next for you? There is no next for me. I mean, it's... it's... it's my life's work. It has not ended. Fine, yes, we've caught some of these evil men, but there are still a lot of other evil men out there. Chief of which is Richard Williams. You see, Richard Williams is an enigma. With Richard Williams, in all my research, I have not been able to pin him down to a particular place of birth. He's... he's from everywhere. He's from nowhere. All we know about him is that he's connected to the highest level of global power. As it is right now, it seems he's untouchable. It sounds like you're describing the Devil himself. Considering all the atrocities he has perpetrated, he might as well be the Devil. Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
