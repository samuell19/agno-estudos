It is said that for the good of their soul, people should do two things they dislike each day. But every day I am troubled by way more than two things. My life seems to revolve around endless work and countless cup noodles. It takes all my effort just to get by. So, like my friends, I put my faith in astrology and Lucky Koi, hoping for a miracle in my life. And now, a miracle has occured. Team credit Sis Sis I don't wanna die single! Watch out. Get out of the way! Happy birthday. You can't be drunk in the morning, can you? You don't smell drunk. Get up and drink together. Get up. Are you stressed out lately? Why are you weeping? No, I'm not. Is it raining now? Let me turn the wiper on. It's not working. We're gonna be late. Take a walk. Blow in it. OK No alcohol, thanks for your corporation. A good miracle is a surprise. A bad one, an accident. Because of an accident, I am magically connected with a stranger thousands of miles away. Revise the bid package for Lingshui Project. Make sure the CAD revisions reflect the opinions from the planning committee experts. I want it at the office by 9am. Morning. It's another day full of energy. I am amazed.

Oh No He saw me at the worst moment. Darn it. Get your dirty hands off. I can tune the piano myself. You think you're better tnan us because you graduated from Berlin Arts Academy? Go to be a pianist! Why are you tuning a piano in this tiny church? Hick. What are you doing? You are just a baby who does nothing but do drugs and play video games. Get your money and go home to mommy. Psycho. If you talk me like that again, I'm gonna get you. All I asked is to put four Roman columns here. What part of it did you not understand? But the architecture is Chinese Hui style. Also, if the cloud patterns on the gate wall are replaced with Rococo style white corals... I'm not paying for you lecture me. By the way, tell your boss send a male engineer next time. Are we clear? Mr. Li Make sure the team follow the drawings and embed the pipes in the right places. - We can't afford any mistake. - Got it. How's it going with you guys? Be careful. Ok, Mr. Chen Mr. Chen You've asked me to come along is there anything I can do for you? I've heard about the client's complaint. Boss told me to cover your back. Sorry for the trouble. I feel like I'm no use at all. It takes time. When I started out, I was just like you. Just like me? Full of passion. Making rash decisions. Hang in there, Ms. An. You are a brilliant architect. It's just that you haven't grasped the law of survival in this business. Mm-hmm. Cheer up. Mr. Chen, Actually, I... Stay safe. Hello? Alright. OK. I'm on my way. Mr. Chen, There you are. What's the rush? I made some desserts yesterday. Have a taste. Dessert? I learned it from a cookery book. Try it. Well then, thanks, Fang Fang. How is it? Not bad, right? Hello, Mr. Gao Ang. We are sorry to inform you that you didn't pass the interview for the pianist. Goodbye. Beethoven was only 13 when he composed his first variation set. Bach was 19 when he wrote Easter Oratorio. Bro, you and I must to make ourselves heard in German music world. Gao ang, my friend, welcome to Germany. I heard the Germans respect the rules. I already rented the apartment. How could they go back on the deal? If it weren't for you, I'd be sleeping out in the street. Bro, not a chance that'll happen. I have no family. You are the only family I have. As per HR, you are not eligible for company compensation since this was an accident on your part. Your absence is recorded as sick leave at half pay. Three days tops. Turn it down! Who is it? Stop playing in the middle of the night! Ah! Are you done? Who is this? Oh No Is the concussion affecting my hearing? Oh No I'm having hallucinations. I must be haunted. I must be haunted. All I did was banged my head... Am I the chosen one that connects the parallel universe? Whoever this is, enough with the shenanigan. Get out of my head right now. YOU get out of MY head! Ouch! When we were fighting yesterday, something seemed to hit his foot, but my foot also hurt. Your brain and another person's brain are connected Human brains undergo changes in the brain waves following a serious concussion. To put it simply, it's like mirroring the phone screen on TV. The phone functions as normal. So does the TV. However, they share the same signal. Don't tell me you're having ice-cream. I'm on period. It's my cheat day. So Am I the phone or the TV? You are the phone. You are also the TV. I happened to have read about similar cases on a lesser-known medical book. Two patients with abnormal brain waves, although thousands of miles apart, could feel the presence of each other every moment of the day. Some of their senses were even connected. When one's heart rate ramped up to over 100 beats per minute, his brain wave would also intensify even to the point of controlling the other's body Controlling my body? My life is already out of control. And now my body, too? What's the cure for it? Like cures like. You brain wave altered because of a hard blow to the head. Therefore, only another blow can bring your brain wave back to normal. But you don't want to end up like this. What can I do now? Let it be. You have to adapt and get used it. Imagine you're a married old couple. Once you're used to each other, you won't be able to live without. But... That's your time. Wechat or Alipay? Maybe you're meant to know each other. Isn't that nice? Goodbye. He is clearly a con man. Don't be stupid. He is a maverick doctor, OK? I won't bother to argue with you. Since you've heard it all, saves the trouble of explaining to you. Let's do this. Are you taking the blow or am I doing it? Do I have a sign on my head that says "stupid"? What do you mean? If you want to fall for a scam and kill yourself, leave me out of it. You are the most irresponsible man I've ever met. What are the odds. You are the most unreasonable woman I've ever met. Irresponsible. Unreasonable. Irresponsible. Yup. Irresponsible I am. Alright. If so, let's set up some rules. Rule No.1 no talking. Rule No.2 stay out of danger. Rule No.3 keep the heart rate under 100. Good. That's exactly what I thought. Goodbye. OK. It's good. Just according to this plan. Are you keeping penguins? What penguins? I said "condition." Have we turned on air conditioning? It's a bit chilly. The AC's off today. Are you having a fever? Go see a doctor if you're ill. For the sake of others. No, sir. I'm not ill. I'm just This plan fully meets the functional need of each floor. Meanwhile, on each floor Hello? What are you doing? Every floor is rotated by one unit. Check your heart rate. You're breaking the rule. Through repetition, every six floors form a recurring pattern, so as to achieve a dynamic effect on a static facade. Excuse me. I'm having an allergy. By adopting such a structure with distinctive variations, we are able to present a high-rise building. That is both modern and dynamic. Once the project is complete, it will become the CBD of the city. Man, what's your problem? I was at work. You were at work, and I am at home. If you hadn't hurt yourself in the head, I wouldn't even be involved. Don't bring this up like it's my fault. You're the one blaming me for your own problem. Stop being a baby. This is childish. Hello? I said stop being a baby. This is childish. The stupid signal is off. Give me your number. I know what you're up to. You're going to use my number to fabricate a dating profile online. What are you, delusional? Delusional? Give me your address. I'll show you who's delusional. Alright. 12 Romantic Road Romantic Germany. Germany? Who are you kidding? I'm in no mood for kidding. Leave me alone. And get out of my body. YOU get out of MY body. You... Mom! Sir, one more round. Ok What are you doing? What? What's the matter? I warned you. Stay out of my life. Quiet down! What did you say? I can't hear you. My hometown makes the best chilly sauce. It's so freaking cold. Are you eating coal? I can't eat spicy food. What a pity. You would miss so much fun. 9478 sheep 9479... You are taking this personally. What's wrong now? You drink coffee at I am. You tell me what's wrong. I told you I live in Germany. It's afternoon. I don't see what's wrong with some coffee. Whereas you are counting sheep in the middle of the night. What are you, a shepherd? "Sheep" rhymes with "sleep." It's a mental trick. Sheep. Sleep I just wanna get some sleep. Sleep. 6550 sheep. 6551 sheep. 6552... Put that down. I said put that down. I didn't get any sleep last night. I need coffee to work. Let go. This is not working. If neither of us gets any sleep, we'll both suffer organ failure. No. You are. This plan takes the honeycomb shape as the motif and extends it through replication. The hexagon motif can be applied both on a 2D and on a 3D design. I don't need your lecturing. Tell me, how are you going to sell this? In terms of form and structure... Are there existing projects that adopt this structure? How do you manage the cost? If the construction team has no relevant experience, what's your solution? Maybe we can try innovating... You want to talk about innovation? The client wanted Roman columns in the Chinese Hui style architecture. Wasn't that innovation? Why did you have to go against him? If I hadn't asked Chen Mingyu to pick up your slack, do you know how much money we would have lost? And What the hell are these? Unbelievable. Are you out of your mind? Look what you've done. Talking to yourself all day. Wrapping yourself up in office. Acting weird in the meeting. You... Do you even want this job? Listen. Get it together, or get gone. We don't keep losers. Hey. This looks really nice to me. Our bald boss has such terrible taste. My good girl, don't let him get to you. It's fine. No need to cheer me up. Ever since I graduated, I've been struggling every day, either to do my job or to pay my rent. My strength is like the sand in this hourglass, slowly draining away. Well, let it drain. Just start it over. If I start over, it'll just be the same old story. No one cares about your idea. No one listens to your opinion They don't see you at all. That's He Qing. Take this. Go introduce yourself. Now? Now is the chance. Hurry up. I don't think so. You can do it. Come on. You can do it. You got this. We're on a truce today. No drinking even at a bar. I know. Hi, Ms. He Qing. Hi. You are Ms...? My name is Anyi. I am also an architect. Assistant. I absolutely adore you. Hello. We're having a chat. I'm sorry for intruding. I'm a big fan of Ms. He. That's alright. Have a seat. The honeycomb shape is the most efficient natural form. You fully incorporate its quality in your design. That's impressive. Really? But my boss sees it differently. It doesn't matter. You'll find someone who sees you. The true value of architecture is not defined by its business profit but by the lives of its residents. Ms. He rarely compliments anybody. Let's drink together. Cheers. I'm sorry. I can't drink today. Next. Gao Ang. Pianist. Is there any problem? No. Everything's fine. Ms. He, let me toast to you. Here. Cheers. Cheers. Mr. Chen. Anyi. How is... your injury? I feel better now. Don't tough it out. I'm glad you feel better. I'm sorry. Happy birthday. Thanks, guys. Come on, Mr. Chen. Make a wish. Three, two, one. Let's make a toast. Here we go. Merry Christmas. Cheers. Merry Christmas. Let's take a photo. Why are you crying? You did a number on me as well. I didn't say a thing. Are you happy now? You didn't have to. You didn't need to make a fool of me. I know what a total fool I am. I never thought of you as a fool. Although you can be unreasonable sometimes. You say things you don't mean. You have a bad temper. You even hurt yourself just trying to get back at me. Is this supposed to be comforting? Isn't it? When I was a child, I cried because I felt Now that, I cry because I'm disappointed. No matter how hard I tried, I could never be recognized by my boss or by the man I admire. I'm such a failure. Many people have to be the one they dislike instead of who they truly are. But if you don't love yourself, nor will anyone else. I didn't know you can say nice things. That's Somerset Maugham. Not me. Fang Fang has been practicing for six months for this moment to blow everyone away. She was supposed to be the host. Not me. Bravo. Thank you so much. What a great performance. Give it up one more time for Fang Fang. She has proved herself both beautiful and talented. To play such an unforgettable piano piece, she must have trained hard for years. Gross. I did it for you, OK? I'm not talking about your spitting. The prize is a Bluetooth headphone. Please check your seat number. Wish you good luck. What are you doing? The piano is 30 degrees to your right. About six meters away. Walk over there. Everybody's watching me. Don't do anything stupid. Stop messing around. Relax. Trust me. Just enjoy your moment to shine. Are you playing? Why didn't you... This is the first time I've cheated. It feels great. Hold on. We've known for a while. But I still don't know your name. Why don't we introduce ourselves? Hi, I'm Anyi. Pleasure to know you. Pleasure is yours. Fine. Since you're so good at piano, I'll call you music prodigy. Prodigy. If I were a prodigy I wouldn't be crashing at a friend's place and working as a tuner in a no name town. I see. You are one of those musicians who puts a million-dollar instrument in a hundred-thousand-dollar car and drives a hundred miles just for a ten-buck gig. I'm sorry. It's OK. I'm used to it. I have walked so long on my journey towards the moon. When I look around, there is not a soul but myself. Those who stay behind for the sixpence are all mocking me. Seriously? He thinks he's a prodigy? Maybe they have a point. Hey. Don't give in to those who look down on you. I don't need your consolation. Hold on a sec. What are you doing? Come on, play the piano. No. Just play. You'll see. Shall we Did you feel it? I've never heard such beautiful music. Hi. I'm Gao Ang. Pleasure to know you. Gao Ang. Gao Ang. You've got this. Honey, what happened to your hands? It's just a protection. You are so adorable. You didn't wear gloves at the construction site but have them on making drawings? That must be a pretty dangerous pencil. Why are you wearing gloves? Protecting your hands. Hands are vital to pianists. If my hands are hurt, you won't be able to play any more. Where did you get those gloves? Feel so stingy. Definitely not made of pure wool. What's the matter? Are you having a fever? I'm cold. Gao Ang. Thank you. If you keep working like this, one day you'll burn out at home, Your body won't be found till three weeks later. Your company won't even shed a tear. Have you heard of this joke? The client tells the designer, Send me the drawing when you leave office. The designer goes, "No problem." Next morning, the client asks, "Where's the drawing?" Why haven't you sent it?" The designer answers, "I haven't left office." That's my life. Is this OK? At least give it a shot. The plan is perfect. The point is the executive power. So remember folks. With strict execution, our sales will double this month. Does it sound good? It sounds great. I told you you're a prodigy. Anyi, actually, I wrote this piece just for... Who is it? Anyi, I... I didn't know you'd done so much for me. I should go. Anyi I don't know why Recently you give me a special feeling. I think I have feelings for you. Gao Ang! Am I dreaming? Ouch! That hurts! What are you doing? Proving that you are not dreaming. I wish you can be happy. My god. Is this a plot twist in my love story? My mind totally blanked out. Did I make a fool of myself? Anyi, I gotta go. Let's talk later. Cut it out, Gao Ang. Morning, Anyi. Morning, Mr. Chen. Who is Gao Ang? My cat. Anyi, I'm calling to ask you to keep our relationship a secret. You know the company's policy. So, for your own sake... I understand. Mum's the word. See you at the office then. See you later. Damn it. Hello? So? Do you like my present? I like it. It's just I've never worn high heels. Women's love for high heels is written in the DNA. No woman can resist their charm. I'll see you later. See you later. So, everyone, allow me to introduce a young, promising architect Chen Mingyu, Mr. Chen. Please. Mr. Zhang, I'm flattered. I should be grateful for your appreciation and for giving us the opportunity to develop. Here, Let me drink a toast to you. Good. I like you. You are straightforward, unlike some self-righteous architect lecturing me on aesthetics. Right? That's why I can count on you. You revise the plan exactly as the client demands, no questions asked. Right? My top priority is the client's interest. Only when clients make profits can architects earn money. If we take architecture as art, we'd starve to death on the drawing board. Let's all drink to Mr. Zhang. Here. Smart. Mr. Zhang. Mr. Zhang. Well, the phase 2 project is on your turn. No problem. Ms. An, I'm told you have excellent piano skills. May I have the honor of listening to your music? Really? You play piano? Show us. There are many people here. I shouldn't be intruding. Right? We're all in the mood for music. That pianist is no match with you.. Play for us. Don't spoil the vibe. Please. Maybe some other time? I insist. Come on, Ms. An. Come on. Do it. Come on, Ms. An. Please. Gao Ang, help me out. I know you're there. Who is he to make decisions for you? Don't you think you've become a tool that pleases Chen Mingyu? Help me out first. I'm begging you. Just for once. I don't care how much you've respected him, but I don't play music lightly. Gao Ang. Gao Ang. Gao Ang. Gao Ang. Gao Ang. I'm sorry. I'm not feeling well. Let's drink. Apparently I'm not important enough. Sorry for embarrassing you. I know you have emotions, but that was our client. You're a grown-up. Have you calculated the cost of being capricious? Do you ever consider the consequence before doing anything? Forget it. I don't wanna get into pointless fights. Drive. Gao Ang, I thought we were friends. Why couldn't you walk in my shoes? No one in the world understands better than you how badly I wanted this relationship. Why did you have to go against me? Are you alright? Yes. What's up? You look more than just upset. You look devastated. I'm devastated every time I work late. I'll be fine. Take it easy. Call me if you need me. Bye. Bye. You didn't return my text. I was dining with the client. You stayed up late just for this? This is a project with Wanhe International. I've got a new idea. You wanna check it out? Lady, spatial imagination is not you women's forte. Why bother anyway? I make the drawings, and you make the spreadsheets. It's as easy as that. But you were supportive... Let's leave it at that. Gao Ang, Again? You're going too far. I don't mean to blame you, but can we talk about it openly? What is your problem? I have no problem. Why did you hit him? Are you going to blame me every time something goes wrong between you two? Did I do something wrong? Listen, go have a glass of hot milk, and go to bed. If you have an issue, just tell me. I can help you. Help me? That's hilarious. You're an idiot who is blinded by love and going to crazy lengths to please the other half. Thanks for the offer, but I'm not the one who needs help. Gao Ang. Being mean and callous only pushes people away. You'll be left in darkness forever, defied any chance to be loved. I was too pushy. A woman's modesty is a man's treasure. Gao Ang, this is not how we're supposed to be. Hello? Is this the moving company? Great job being late. Do you know how long I've been waiting? Hello? You hear me? Hello? To disconnect the brain wave, you must endure not just the blow to the head, but also the excruciating pain caused by the resonance with the sudden counter wave. Final warning for you once you're disconnected, she'll be lost for good. I won't bother to argue with you. Are you taking the blow or am I? Are you sure you wanna do this? She is your only soulmate in this lonely world. Think twice. Anyi, Happy birthday. Thank you. I've always wanted to ask, What is that you like about me? I like that you can play the piano and that you are a good, obedient girl. Gao Ang, you've got this Don't give in to those who look down on you. Gao Ang. Gao Ang. Stop it for now, Chen Mingyu. Stop it. No. I said no. I said no. Why did you hit him? Are you going to blame me every time something goes wrong between you two? Can you grow up? I don't have the time or the mood to play this mind game with you. What the hell is your problem? Stop being condescending and blaming your problems on everyone else. My problems? Yes. I shouldn't have picked up your slack when you were being stubborn and almost caused us to lose a big client. I shouldn't have covered for you when you acted crazy in the meeting. I shouldn't have apologized on your behalf when you threw a tantrum on the client. Everybody's watching you. So, for your own sake... That's how you think of me all along? Anyi, I told you I don't want to get into fights. I just want you to be a good and obedient... Chen Mingyu, I admit. I had fallen for you since my first day in office. To me, you were a far-fetched dream. I'd never thought it would become true. But then I mistook worship for love. I never questioned anything you did. I didn't tell anyone about our relationship. I didn't tell you how much I hated high heel shoes. I also didn't tell you how much I detested your sycophantic philosophies. What did you say? It is over. By the way, I can not play the piano. What's the matter with you? I really don't get you. You never did. Gao Ang. Gao Ang. Gao Ang. Gao Ang. Gao Ang. Hello. The number you have dialed does not exist. Please check and redial. Does it sound good? It sounds great. I told you you're a prodigy. Many people have to be who they dislike instead of who they truly are. But if you don't love yourself, nor will anyone else. Gao Ang. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right. I was an idiot. I was a fool. I was unreasonable. But please say something to me. Please say something to me. My hometown makes the best chilly sauce. Gao Ang. Gao Ang. I can't eat spicy food. What a pity. Gao Ang. Gao Ang. Gao Ang. Gao Ang. Gao Ang. Enough I said so many hurtful things, but I didn't mean any of them. I feel like such a fool. I know all the marker colors by heart, but I don't know what my heart wants. It hurts so much. He said he is allergic to alcohol. Am I intoxicated now? Whenever I think of him, it hurts. It hurts right here. Wu I lost him. Why don't you fly over to see him? Germany Am I a fool? What is your problem? Where are you? Get back here right now! Gao Ang? Are you here for the Chinese lad? Hello. Do you know where is the landlord? Are you his friend from China? Yeah. You probably don't know yet. He just passed away. I'm so sorry. Such a pity. He was such a young boy. It's cold out here. Come on in. I'll make you some coffee. Come in. Ms. An, here is your file. Thank you. And this is the online novel I told you about. Every time you play this song, it reminds me of this book. It's amazing. So I printed it out. Put it here. OK. Ms. He. Do you have a pad? I'll get you one. I know I can count on you. By the way, clear your schedule this Saturday. A guy from my school just returned from abroad and is seeking a job in Beijing. He is an Ivy League doctor. Became a partner at a firm right out of college. He's a really nice guy. Definitely a keeper. He's only been in one relationship. I looked through the contract with Wanmao. They are pushing for a deal. Check it out when you can. Work can wait before the deadline. But love is elusive. Miss it and it's gone for good. You're killing me here. Do I have a chance with you? You wish. It's gonna take a longer "period." Get out. Fine. Somerset Maugham said, "Each one of us is alone in the world. He is shut in a tower of brass, and can communicate with his fellows only by signs, and the signs have no common value." That is why we are all lonely in this world. I was constantly overwhelmed by loneliness. It became ever more suffocating when my only friend fell into coma. Just as I gave in to loneliness, That girl broke into my world. Who is it? No, I should say, she broke into my mind in a way that's irritating yet irresistible. Get out of my head right now. YOU get out of MY head! Those days were miserable. But once gone, they became the most beautiful memories. It was a profound soul-binding experience. She shared my pains and sorrows. She inhabited my heart. The greatest happiness is that The person you're waiting for is also waiting for you. The person you care about also cares about you. The person you see can see you through. But it was a fleeting luxury for me. I tried to hide my attachment to her. Because if I crossed the line it would crush her hard-won happiness. I think I have feelings for you. If this was a test, I failed. I decided to accept it and leave. It was a relief at the moment. But in the days that followed, I was devoid of everything. Gao. My condolences. It's been seven years. You've taken good care of Marvin. You've tried your best. You probably don't know yet. He just passed away. Maybe some things are better left in memories. Some people are meant to be missed. Here's the thing about time. Your thoughts may be many, but the night will end. The snows may be heavy, but winter will be over. Before you realize, another year is around the corner. So I should move on now. In time, the bitter will fade away. Good morning. Where are they? At the rehearsal room. Do not let anyone fiddle with my piano. You're such a lousy pianist. You're not a great novelist yourself. It is said that in your world 70% of people know you. 20% of people use you. 6% of people hate you. 4% of people like you. But only 0.1% of people see you. She is my 0.1%. Hi, I'm Anyi. Pleasure to know you. Hi. I'm Gao Ang. Pleasure you to know you.
