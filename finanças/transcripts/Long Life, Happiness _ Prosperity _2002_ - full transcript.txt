Yellow God, Yellow God. Thank you for making my life heaven on earth. Tam, what's she doing? The latest charm she learned. She's our newest best customer. She's talking to herself. ...phone work. Her crazy mother, what an oddball. Hey, she was happy once. Then her husband runs off... leaves her with the baby. No wonder her kid's weird. Lily used to be like Mindy. Shuck and I couldn't wait for her to grow up. But now the house is too quiet. Good. You can have sex whenever you want. Coming through! Coming through! Barbeque pork buns, sticky rice wraps, chicken feet... Good. Let me pay! Let me pay! No, let me Pa!!! - Whoa! - Sorry, Kin. What are you waiting for? Hurry up! Yellow God, Yellow God... What did I do? Was I ungrateful? Hun Ping, what's wrong? I'm missing Lily. I can't help it. The house feels so empty. I prayed to the Yellow God. He'll protect Lily. He'll protect all of us. What if he doesn't? You must have faith. Without a God, we might as well be dead. I'll be alone one day. Why are you talking such nonsense? What a fuss. Nothing, nothing. You feel so far away. You're just missing Lily. You think it's me? Don't worry. With the Yellow God, we are blessed. Really? Of course. Our devotion will be answered. Our devotion will be answered. Don't worry. It's my dime, Dad. You always worry about long distance. Father-in-law, how are you? Thank you for Peter's wonderful gift. No need to thank me. Can I speak to him? Sorry. He has a sore throat. Well he has to hurry to start his training. Yes, yes, and he's very excited! Thanks to you. Can I speak to Bing? Great as always! You are my most honored father. Shuck! Hun Fin!!! I'm just doing my rounds. - Guess what I heard? - What? The All Fix needs a full-time calligrapher. I'm going to meet Lee Tai-Tai about it. They're lost without me. I'm sorry. Can we talk later? Sure. Oh, I almost forgot, I brought you a treat. Dance with me. Come on. You're in a good mood. You were right. You've got to have devotion. I got the job. I thought we should celebrate. And since... we have the house to ourselves... My wife has a job. How ironic. You said it. Devotion will be answered. My wife has a job. But wait... I must offer thanks to the Yellow God. Lee Tai-Tai, your charms always work! Thank you so much. One dose and the house sold! I just heard... What are you talking about? Shuck losing his job. You must be so upset. Yes. Yes, I am. Excuse me. - Mr. Zong, How are you? - Fine, and you? - I wanted to ask you... - Yes? Do you need an able-bodied man to help you out? Looking for work? Yes, I am always ready for work. What's so funny? Life's funny. If I had a wife like yours, I'd quit working in a flash. But here you are wanting a second job. Isn't that funny? Yes. Life is funny. Well, there's no work here. I'm sorry. Wrong number... alright. You've reached the Lai residence. Please leave a message. Dad... I know I am not good enough. I shouldn't be calling you. I deserve silence. But a lot of years have passed. I have great news to share. I have won the lottery. I'm sorry if I let you down in the past. I promise to spend the rest of my life making you proud. Dad, I am mailing, overnight service, a first-class ticket. I am honoring you with a big party- Come and bless us with a speech... ...for posterity. Please think about it... Dad... I've never stopped... ...thinking of you. Yes, Bing, I will bless you with a speech... I will bless you... Come in! Sit down. What do you want? I understand. BIG LOVE MAGNET. My Yellow God... Are you smiling or frowning? You've been playing with me, haven't you? Judging my heart. Thank you for this test, Divine One. I know all will be well. Shuck! That was your brother, Yeu. He wants to take us out for lunch. He has good news. Shuck... You know how many times he's asked you to join his business. Perhaps the time is right? Yes, the time is right. Oh, Yellow God, you are so kind. Only true love. You've lost weight. I can benchpress 100 lbs. now. You should come, too. Pump iron! Maybe one day. Brother-in-law Yeu, how is business? Yes, yes, my big news. I hope you will be pleased. You've always said I work too hard, and too much. It's true, you will hurt your health. You think I don't listen, but I do... That's why... I'm retiring. I'm so lucky. Can you believe it? I will learn golf. Congratulations to you. Yes, we congratulate you. Allow me. It's such wonderful news. But you are my guests. - It's mine. - Brother, please. - It's done. - I want to pay! - Don't dishonor me! - This is my meal! Don't! I am the oldest brother. Yes, yes you are. Tell me, why all this suffering? What did he do? What did I do? My husband is a good man. Yellow God, I beg you... Take care of him and protect us. What are you doing? I'm talking to the Yellow God. What are you doing? He's not listening. Good morning. Good morning. I have to deliver my work to Lee Tai-Tai. You gonna be okay? I'm fine. I've got to get to work, too. Shuck... Nothing. - You again! - Miss me? You! You don't think I see you? Where are you going? You were in my room. Did you find something nice? My things... You little thief. Look at your trash! What kind of mother are you? Raising a little thief! Please, she's just a child. She stole from me! That's enough now. I'll take care of this. My dearest... Bad storm! The Gods are angry. Party's over. Let's go. Dad, where are you? Dad. I said I would bless you with a speech. And here it is... Stop bothering me once and for all. In my heart you were dead to me 20 years ago. And this is... an unchanged... truth. 20 years ago? I can explain. Who was I on the phone with? You must think we're all so stupid. Well, you're right... I am stupid! Stupid to have married you. Where are you going? To be with my son. I'm back. Yellow God... - Shuck... - Hun Ping. You're all wet. You scared me to death. I've been looking everywhere for you. Why didn't you think about me, why? I thought you might be lost. The Yellow God... showed me the way back to you. What do you mean?
