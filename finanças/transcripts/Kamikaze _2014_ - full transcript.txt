MONDAY We haven't got much time. Take off your clothes, Slatan. They're both ready. But tomorrow, only one will go. It's your decision. I'll go. I'll go. Let luck decide. Got a coin? And you? Should I go for change? There's a supermarket. No. How about you? I haven't got anything. I found one. Heads, tails. Slatan, you win. TUESDAY Move slowly. Act sure of yourself. Make eye contact. What if something goes wrong? Wrong? What is your name? My name is Slatan Sveraev. Where are you traveling to? Spain. - Why? - Work. Alicante, pharmaceutical. The jacket you're wearing has nothing metal. The scanner won't detect the explosives. Nothing will go wrong. Are you carrying anything metal? Oh, right. It must be my wedding ring. Remove your shoes. What could I be carrying in my shoes? A machine gun? Plutonium? What are you afraid of? You must not be searched. They cannot touch you. What's wrong with you people? This is disrespectful. Why are you touching me? - Thank you. - You're welcome. You'll detonate the bomb during takeoff. Over the urban area. With 90,000 liters of kerosene in the tanks. The metal components of the detonator will be hidden in your personal objects. There are two ways to detonate the bomb. The cord on your chest detonates the bomb in your jacket. If you're discovered, push the auxiliary button. The bomb will explode after four minutes. Right when the cops are all over you. They will never take you alive. The mix of explosives is very sensitive. Humidity makes it unstable. Do not drink. Do not sweat. If it gets wet, it will explode. Act like a normal passenger. Be friendly. Alex! Don't be a nuisance. Sit down. For years you've lived hidden like a dog in Alicante. Do you speak Spanish? A little bit. He's not completely deaf. He has 6% hearing. He had an accident at home. They can operate when he's older. Women... will embroider your face on clothing. Children... will learn your name at school. Slatan. All of Karadjistan is with you... Where's your luggage, Sasha? We agreed that if I didn't relapse, we were going to Spain today. Your sacrifice is the greatest act of love. If I'm nuts, don't come with me. Stay in this shitty city. It smells like a hospital! If I'm nuts, you shouldn't be with me! - You're not well. - Of course I'm not. - I'm not going. - Wait... It's your time, Slatan. You'll be a hero. Sasha, please... Give me another chance. Please, don't leave me. I'll kill myself. I swear I will. People will never forget you. You're going to die for our people. Russia has offended our honor... ...murdered our hope. 100 years of oppression are enough. We will not hang our heads. We will not forgive their insults. We will never forget our fallen. 100 years of oppression are enough. All of our enemies will die. They will die. They will die! Excuse me. Thank you. Excuse me. The Chinese make everything their size. Let's see... Here we are. Pardon me. I just married this pretty little mouse sitting beside you and they gave us separate seats. Would you mind sitting here in my seat? I'll change seats. - Really? You don't mind? - Not at all. Thank you. Do you speak Castilian? Spanish, do you speak Spanish? A little. I saw you in Customs... They checked everything but my rectum. They're psychotic about terrorism, Jesus. It's crazy. Hold on. The seatbelt. Where's the...? Wait... Oh, that's yours. You're right. Good lord. My God. Geez, it's hot. "What to do in case of an accident." Preparing us for the worst. The wings on Russian planes are stapled on. Never fails. Accident, Russian plane... Two anti-anxiety pills and a prayer... and we'll be in Madrid. I'm Eugenio Sanardy. Eugene. Slatan Sveraev. Nice to meet you. Russian? Sorry, they spilled... - There. - Yes. All set. Thanks. We're going to spend more than 6 hours together. A lot of marriages don't last that long. - Oh, newlyweds. Congratulations. - Thank you. - Honeymoon in the Caribbean. - Yeah? Who could ask for more? After two years living in Moscow. - Hooray for the newlyweds. - Hooray. What's wrong? What's going on? I told you. Russian plane. Something defective. Technical problem? It smells like gasoline. Your attention, please. The flight has been cancelled due to the storm. The passengers who need lodging will be taken to a hotel. But due to the number of cancellations, it's possible the hotel will be out of town. What time will the plane leave tomorrow? We'll pick you up at ten, sir. Have your luggage ready. Enjoy your stay. Damn Russian music. I can't believe it! What are you doing here? -It's a mistake. - My room. No, my room! Okay, it'll be our room. Seated together, sharing a room... It's destiny. - How about that! - How about what? No, I mean... What's your trade, pal? Your job. What do you do? I sell medicine. We're practically colleagues. I sell shoes. Nothing like a good shoe for a healthy body. Look. Check these out. Not bad, huh? Ladies shoes. You know why? Know what my slogan is? So comfortable even a man can wear them. No blisters, never a damn chilblain. Sanardy Shoes change your life. I have some with me, look. Yeah, springs. Russian hotels still don't use bed frames. Like sleeping in a bird cage. Don't move. Why not? Because... my bed. 0K8)'- I'm going to the can. Hi, it's Slatan. I'm in a hotel. Are you crazy? They'll trace the call! Hang up, you idiot! Hang up! Hang up! Hang UP! WEDNESDAY Hi. Hi. I need some razors. - Razors? - Yeah. The storm caught me off guard... and I want to shave my legs. Shave. One moment. Razors. - Thank you. - Goodbye. Excuse me. Excuse me. Good morning. When are they taking us to the airport? It probably won't be today. The forecast is snow, snow... and more snow! 0K8)'- I'd like to change rooms, to a single. All the rooms are shared. This is a small hotel. It isn't prepared for so many guests. I'm sorry. Good morning! Any problems with the snow last night? Please try to understand. Ruskie! Come here. You can sit by me. Come on. He didn't hear me. There's no oatmeal? A kiwi? Something healthy. What do you mean, I can't cancel? 7 thousand euros! - Sorry... - No, no... Please, ladies first. - Thank you. - Miss, are you lame? I'm trapped in Russia. Russia! How should I know what time I'm getting to Puerto Vallarta? Say you'll be there at a quarter to. Have them put some champagne on ice. Like hell I'm going to pay the honeymoon suite. I am being polite, just don't fuck with me. It's my honeymoon! Once in a lifetime! I won't send shit in writing! Pinhead! Thief! You're corrupt! I'm sorry, I can't talk right now. I don't know what's happening. I can't stop laughing! Finished? What's a lady with such a great sense of humor doing in the Russian steppe? I was at a funeral. My husband's. Mmm, tasty. Hi. Hi. What happened to your wrist? Nothing. I cut myself on a bottle of perfume. Clumsy me! Here we are, the whole Spanish colony. And it looks like for a while. We should do something tonight for entertainment. Alex! Karaoke? Getting laid is pretty unlikely. Maestro, you play the piano, right? I've called the company 85 times already. I talked to a machine that... Camilo, what's your problem? - Sorry, my love. - You think this is normal? Have you seen my son? Always the same. I turn around and he takes off. Alex! He was playing in the snow. Hold him for a second, okay? Wait...! That was you outside the door in the bathroom, right? It wasn't a bottle of perfume. You know what? If you really want to cut vein, you have to cut vertical. And zigzag. So they can't stitch. Then you get in bathtub with hot water. There you can go... very peacefully. 0K8)'- Can you watch baby? Yes. Get out of here. Out! Knowing that I loved you, that you were my joy and my blazing dream. It's too late to comfort me. That's why I get drunk to forget your love. Bravo! What's going on? Karaoke night. Who wants to try? Come on, my shoes are full of swing. That's it! Ruskie! How about it? Sing us something. We're in your land. Sing something from Mother Russia. You want a little help? Maestro? Hit it. Ravil! The storm has intensified with a low pressure polar front. In the next 48 hours'; we expect lows of -32C along with strong winds and heavy snow. Oh, good. There's a little left. Bring it over. Keep the party going. Lola, if you want to go to bed, that's okay. What? I have a babysitter for once. I left them with the Argentinean. He'll dance them right to sleep! Tell me, sweetie... What brought you to Russia? Want me to show you? Where is there a telephone? Here. No... ls there a public telephone anywhere around here? I feel like going for a walk to get the blood flowing. It's 30 degrees below zero outside and the nearest village is 9 kilometers to the north. To the north. Thanks. - You looked beautiful. - There we are. Six months after meeting in Torrevieja. “Listen to me, Dolores. Do you find me attractive? Well, honey?“ He should try a little sun block! His face looks like a monkey's ass! "It's not the sun, I'm red from the vodka. From the liquor. From the brandy. From drinking anything." Go on, put your tie on your head, Boris. Look, look! "This is as calm as you'll see me in the next 8 years. Everyone listen to me. The Spanish girl married a Russian. And she thinks that because I'm old I'll treat her with respect and dignity. Well, I won't. I will leave her with two children. Without a single orgasm, not a penny to her name and with marks on her body. With this open hand I'll beat her for 8 years, her and her children. And if one of them goes deaf, too bad. That's life." My wrist could have really used one of your broken bottles of perfume. What rotten luck. Such a pretty young girl cutting herself like that. Lucky it wasn't serious. We can't take your call at the moment. Please leave a message. It's Slatan. This phone is safe. The plane has been delayed a few days by the storm. If I don't receive instructions, I'll blow myself up at the Limbads Hotel. I repeat. I can kill... I can kill 20 or 30 people. For Karadjistan! THU RS DAY Go away! Go away! Dog... Easy... Good boy. Stay there. Stay. Eugene. Your roommate, the Russian... He never talks. No, he's a little shy. I'm calling from room 104, Slatan Sveraev. - Has anyone called me? - One moment. No, you have no calls. Shy'? I would say anti-social. He doesn't even say hi to people. Alex, honey, wipe your face. Stop teaching them gross things. Let's not judge Slatan for not saying hi once. It's not only that. He kind of scares me. Not just his appearance, it's the look in his eye. What look? Listen. Dragging my ass across the world for 30 years has taught me 2 things: The first... Sanardy Shoes make you walk better. That... Russia has offended our honor, murdered our hope. The second: How to know people. You look at the Russian and what do you see? He doesn't wear Christian Dior, his cell phone is out of credit... he doesn't go around telling jokes in the hallway“. 100 years of oppression are enough. And you know why? Because something tragic happened to him. Something is wrong and he carries it inside. He doesn't sleep. He spends the whole night pacing back and forth, consumed by his anguish. Maybe he never talks, that's true. But he listens. So what? Is that weird? Maybe we're the ones who are weird. We let him eat breakfast alone in a corner. For Karadjistan! For my people! Slatan Sveraev! Your call. Your call. Slatan? We heard your message. The mission is still on. You must blow up the plane in ﬂight. Until then, behave like a normal passenger. - Understood? Understood. For your people, Ruskie. - For your people, Slatan. - For your people. For your people. Thank you. Thank you. He is a little weird. Just a little. I saved this for you, or the Chinese will eat it. You have a button loose. Take off your coat, I'll mend it for you. We hear you're buying breakfast. Nice touch! We're keeping you company. I'll trade you this cookie. These are delicious. Here's to you, Slatan. He's scratching his head a lot. So is he. What? My God, look at all those split ends. I think you got lice from the boy. Lola. How about a ride in my convertible? Oh, a sled! Okay. I'll put up my hair like Grace Kelly. As long as we don't end up like her. Okay, you two are on your own. Where are you going? Okay-- By the way, my name is Anunciacién, but everyone calls me Nancy. After the doll. I'm Slatan Sveraev. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Yes. Wait, it won't rinse out. Sorry. I need your help. Hold the towel with your hand. It's very pretty. What does "nadezhda“ mean? Hope. Hope? Wow, the Ruskie is sensitive. Ready. Up. Parted in the middle, on the side or shoulder-length? Hold on, Lola. Hold on tight or you'll go flying. This thing is a rocket going down the hill. Trust me, Lola, don't hold back. Come on. That's it. Go with the flow, you're with an expert. Our trip was insured, right? You should send an SUV or a damn tank for us. Mr. Garrido, I'm going to take legal action. Slatan, watch out... We're almost there, one last push. You look very handsome. Who does your hair, Slatan? You're dangerous with scissors, huh? You know what? A lot of people have tried to dissuade me from killing myself. But nobody had ever given me advice about how to do it painlessly. That's very nice. Thank you, Slatan. You're welcome. Sorry! Hold on! Watch out! Eugene! - Are you sure you're okay? - Yes, yes. That was quite an impact! Just a scare. It looked worse than it was. Hey, Ruskie. I have a question for you. I need to ask him something. Listen... Come with me... I broke my balls. - Look at me. - What are you doing? Is everything where it should be? It was like an explosion, a crunch... I felt something burst. - I'm coming, okay? - Take a look. Please. Well? What the fuck am I doing here? Should I put it on ice? What's wrong? Get out. What's wrong? If you have a problem, so do I. I must dry medicine, need to keep warm. Problem of life or death. Don't worry. Please, everyone come out here. The Ruskie has a problem. We need to dry his medicine. We need heat. - A hair dryer. - I have a heater. Please. - A hair dryer? - Please. - I have an extension cord. - Sure. - I have an electric blanket! - Get it. MY hair dryer! It's dry. What a mess. Right, dog? I have a theory about heels on shoes. Yes, I think the height is related to a woman's problems. Two centimeters, few problems. Eight centimeters, a ton of problems. I love them! Thank you very much. They're beautiful. How high would yours be? Fifteen... -at least. - Good lord. I don't think I have any... Have you got family? Divorced. Well, in Argentina getting divorced is required for citizenship. It's in the Constitution. Selling shoes in three countries a week... Well, you don't get home late. You're never there. Maybe I married the wrong person. Me too. So I decided to run away with my children. But the day right before I got on the plane... he goes and leaves me. Myocardial heart attack. He drank vodka like chocolate milk. I don't know... He's upstairs, in the room. - Here? - His ashes. In the room. Here we go! Press 1 if you'd like to buy an airline ticket. No. Press 2 if you'd like to speak to check in. Not on your fucking life. Press 3 if you'd like to buy insurance. Which later turns out to be useless. Explain the reason you're calling briefly and clearly. Need ﬂight. We did not understand you. Please repeat. That damn crematorium... They vacuum seal the urn and I can't... Please. A tool of my trade. Sorry. This will be weird for him. All that ice and so little vodka. Did you want to say a few words'? Fuck him. Amen. He said 89. Here we go. 43. Wait, wait, wait. I wanted... to thank you because you helped me... It was nothing, son. Here, sit down. Come on. We have 33... Let's do this: How about you turn the lever -and say the number out loud. - Go on. Here we go! I'm having a bad streak. Here, let me. Are you sure? - No, but... - Okay. - He's all yours. -53. In Russian, please. 53. This feels like... -a vacation. It's funny. - It is. At least for me. He always does that every time! Well, well... - Did he get you wet? -It's holy water. - Holy water, he says! - Sure. Silly. 72. Who said I couldn't fly a kite at 20 below? We've done everything but play smash ball. Right, honey? Slatan. Give me a 22 and we'll run away with the winnings. Okay? Let's go, bingo! Who has the bingo cards? - We'll play together. - Are you having fun? Tell me' Are you enjoying your honeymoon? Because while I eat shit on the phone all you do is play with dessert, your kite, the snowman and all the other crap! We have nothing in common. I married a little boy who'll never grow up. Grow up? What for? To be unhappy, like you? Because you seem very sad to me, Natalia. You know what the problem is? The honeymoon wasn't the reason I got married. You are. And you choose where the sun and the beach are. That's Russia for you. Plenty of sun and beach. That's how it is. Russian cuisine is good, that's true. Yes, excellent. Ruskie, let's make a goulash for everyone tonight. We can make Chinese food too. We'll find out if it's true the Chinese eat each other. I'm kidding. Where's your friend? How about it, Ruskie? Let's cook. Goulash, goulash, goulash! Goulash! Goulash, goulash! I'm not from Russia! I'm not from Russia, Eugene. I'm from Karadjistan. Karadjistan. Do you know where that is on a map? No. My people were crushed by Russia. And they exiled us. They cut our electricity, communications. Power. Food! Did the United Nations do anything? No. Domestic problem, they called it. Nothing is what your countries do. They do nothing. And after years of embargo... nothing is left. No hospital. No medicine. No antibiotic. Children die and diarrhea. And then bombing start. Ravil! Slatan. Slatan. Slatan. Slatan, I need you in the hall. It's urgent. Please, hurry. Camilo! What? We have to wait? Half an hour? Please. Please. Alex, Lola's son, ran off into the woods. It's been half an hour. - Let's do a sweep. - We need to hurry. - It's 30 below. - My boy won't hear us. But he'll see us. Don't worry, we'll find him. - Oh my God. - Here. No, I'm not going. What? Weren't you listening? A 7-year-old boy is freezing to death. I'm not going. 30 below zero. Boy is dead. Lola... Lola! How can you say that? I thought I knew people. I don't know shit. Go on. Go. You know something? You should get another tattoo that says there is no hope. Because there's a little boy alone out there in the snow waiting for his mother to find him. And he's going to die like a little bird. You know? You don't care. You're dead, Slatan. You're dead. And you don't know how sorry I am. Alex! Alex! Mauthausen. 1944. I know what you were talking about in there. The bombing, the killing, the horror... I can't complain. I'm alive. Mom, Dad... My five brothers and sisters. They all ended up getting cremated. Some nights I still dream about the smell coming out of the smokestacks. The smell of Mom and Dad. Son, no matter how much you've suffered, there's always someone who suffers more than you. Always. Alex! Find! Slatan? Slatan! Slatan! Slatan... Slatan... Where are you going? Boy look for sound of quarry. That way. Alex! Where are you? Alex! Alex! Alex! Please, no... Please, no... Oh, my baby... My baby... Thank you... Thank you... Thank you... Look. Ravil. He's very handsome. Yeah. He took a long time to come into this world. He didn't want to leave his mother's belly. Smart, huh? Neighbor had to come to help with birth. They had to cut her open to take out. No doctor, no hospital... My wife died during the birth. But Ravil lived. And he didn't cry. Here we went to Kostani. Kostani? And I told him that if he got lost, not to move. To stay where he was, that Daddy would find him again. You know? And he looked at me with face he made and went like this: When he did that everything... I knew everything would be okay. You know? And he got lost. And at 11:30... M-15 started bombing like always. I lost Ravil... He was good boy. He didn't move. In the middle of square. Waiting. He held duck very tight. Tight. Very, very tight, like holding him... would keep him in world of the living. But no. - Don't cry. - No, I'm not crying. It's just... Good night, Nancy. You mean good morning. FRIDAY Don't be like that. It's a Christmas sweater from Santa Claus. Your clothes are in tatters. Nancy and the rest of us all chipped in... Why don't you shut up a little? Give me a hug. Take it easy, man, come on. That's it. Thank you' Really. For what you did for the boy. I misjudged you at first, but I care about Lola and the boys very much and... We stayed up all night talking... "Pim, pum, pam...“ Until dawn. -"Pim, pum, pam?" - What? -"Pim, pum, pam?" - No, no... No, talking, really. She's a wonderful woman. I see love here! - No, no... - What? It would be crazy. We live on different continents. Come on. Look at him run! Bravo! Thank you! Hero! Brave! How are you? Are you okay? He's okay. Bravo! Okay, we can let the lovebirds go back to their honeymoon and keep the party going. Who wants to give it a try? Come on! Slatan, sing a song from Rajistan, from your country. Yeah, come on! - Let's hear it! - I don't want... Sing! Sing! Sing! Everybody settle down. Singing isn't Slatan's style. But yes, - I can sing a song for you. - Okay. 0K8)'- Come on! I can't believe it! Let's go! I can't believe it! Let's go, my friend. The stage is yours, Slatan. - I only know one. - Then sing that one. - Or sing another one. - Stud! Russia has offended our honor, murdered our hope. 100 years of oppression are enough. We will not hang our heads. We will not forgive their insults. We will never forget our fallen. We will fight the enemies who strangle us. We will fight to the end! To the end! The enemy will die. The enemy will die. All of our enemies will die. They will die, they will die, they will die. Our country we will free. We will never give in to the enemy. Quiet! Quiet. Russia has offended our honor, murdered our hope. 100 years of oppression are enough. We will fight to the end. Russia has offended our honor, murdered our hope. 100 years of oppression are enough. All of our enemies will die. They will die! They will die! Bravo! Is that tasty? Well, dog... How are you doing? The airport will be opening in one hour. The bus outside will take you to the international terminal. The plan is still on. As we agreed. Is that clear? It's clear. You... You're a rock star, Slatan. You're the man, Slatan. The fucking king. Holy shit. Forget about Bon Jovi. Spaniard... When we get back to Madrid, set up a concert! For you this has been a mountain holiday. - Your mission ends here. - No. You can go back to your family. They're waiting for you. Tell your parents that you'll be home for dinner. And your wife Yedé will be there, celebrating your return. You must be eager to see... your son Ravil after all this time. Of course I want to see my son Ravil. And I Will. Everything is fine. Don't worry. Come on, we're leaving! The rickety bus is here! Let's go! Excuse me... Bye-bye Russia! Here we go! The best honeymoon! The Caribbean is overrated. Slatan... I was looking for you. What...? It's just a little cold. The 30 below zero will make him stronger. Like an Eskimo. What's the plan when you get there? Well... my sister is picking me up at the airport after all. Just as well. Because with the baby -and stroller... - Yes. And the bus to Madrid... And you? Run around, as usual. - All over the place. - Right. - Eugene. - Yes? Sorry. Somethings wrong with Slatan. He's been in the bathroom for 20 minutes. After the fajitas the other day, I'm not surprised... Excuse me. Lola. Go ahead and board. What is it? What's wrong with him? What is that? It's a bomb! Eugene! Son of a bitch. You said it was medicine and it's a bomb. There's a terrorist in the airport. We don't understand. Say it's not true. They don't trust me. What? What's wrong? There's another terrorist. Eugene... Understand? Where are you going? Eugene! Eugene... Eugene, I swear... I swear on my son Ravil that you aren't wrong about me. Andrei, come over here. They only speak Spanish. There's more medicine on the plane... What's the problem? Dad? He's my father. He's not well. Everything's fine. They'll catch the terrorist, okay? Are you wearing Mom's shoes again? Sorry. He'll try to detonate bomb in the air. We have to disarm him before we take off. He has a detonator on his chest and delay button in his hand. If he sees any police or notices anything strange, he won't hesitate. He'll blow himself up. So we have to do it by ourselves. Pardon me, sir. I just married this pretty little mouse... and they gave us separate seats. Would you mind changing seats? Excuse me. I'll change with you. Okay, yeah. Young people still get married, huh? They don't know what comes after. Break-ups, lawyers... A total bust. Hooray for the newlyweds! Here, let me hold him. Let me hold him, see if he calms down. Come here... It's okay, come here... Come on. Just as I thought, a full nappy. Let's change you. Do you need some help? - It looks like it. - Thanks. It's not easy in a plane. I'm good with kids. Yeah, they love me. Here we go... That's it... Here, take him... Sorry... Easy... He's a baby. Slatan! Slatan... - Hold him tight. - Are you okay? - Nancy. - What? He pressed delay button. What does that mean? That bomb will explode in 4 minutes. Slatan, what are you going to do? Get the bomb out of here. Tell the captain to stop the plane or it will explode. - Slatan, don't! - Oh my God... Take emergency positions and lean forward. - I'm not letting go. - Nancy... There's a bomb on board. I repeat... - Nancy... - I'm not letting go... I go wherever you go. - You can't come! - Yes! Get it out of here... Everyone... Sound the alarm! Are you okay? We have to start over. Start over in Russian prison? Stop! I said stop! Stop. you scum! Get down on the ground! I said get down on the ground! Hands on your head! Go away, dog. Go away. No! Go away! Go! Get away from me! Prepare to fire! Stop or we'll shoot! Stop! Get away! First and second, fire! I'm his girlfriend! If you die, I'll kill you. If you die, I'll kill you... You told the police you're my girlfriend? Yeah. Yeah. I finally find a good man and look what trouble you get yourself into. Don't talk now. It will be okay. Yes. Slatan! Sorry. Sorry. - Sorry. -It's okay. Take it. Slatan! What did one terrorist say to the other terrorist? This is gonna be a blast! Slatan! There's always someone who suffers more than you. And you only have two choices: Either rot inside, or dance to the rhythm of life. SATURDAY
