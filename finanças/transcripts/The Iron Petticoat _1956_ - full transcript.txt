HEADQUARTERS OF THE UNITED STATES ARMED IN GERMANY Once upon a time... RUSSIAN ZONE EAST GERMANY Aquí Foxtrot Red and Blue. An unidentified plane is approaching . - Are you sure of that signal? - Take a look for yourself, sir. It goes this way. Hello, Foxtrot. Here Turnip. We have one for you. It is dangerous. Here Turnip control. Go ahead Foxtrot. Go ahead Foxtrot. - The interceptors are closing in. - Foxtrot Red and Blue, this is Turnip. Here Turnip. Is it a Russian Mig? I repeat, is it a Russian Mig? Foxtrot Red and Blue, acérquese. Follow me - Colonel. - Have you already spoken to the prisoner? - No sir. - Good. I want to take care of myself for several reasons. This should be done by someone who understands the Russian temperament. - That's asking a lot. - Not if it was studied first. - Do you understand English? - Naturally. - What's it called? - Inka Captain Kovelenko. - Pilot. - Do you mind taking off your helmet? - A woman! - Correct, sir. - Sit down, Miss Kovelenko. - Captain Kovelenko! I do not feel if there is a colonel standing. Excuse me We welcome another refugee from the Iron Curtain. I am not a political refugee. Let's say we're happy to welcome a smart Russian who thinks communism is in bad taste. - That is false. - The fact that? That I am against communism. It's the salvation of the world and the cherished dream of its inhabitants. Straight to the point. Explain the violation of our airspace. No problem. It's very simple. I've lost my temper. - By the communists? - No. Because of the male sex. - Can you be more explicit? - I have confessed. - What else do you want? - I want facts. It will not come from Russia and enter American territory just because she's blinded by some boyfriend. What is this about being blind? May I take the floor? - Ahead! - The colonel wonders if she left Russia because a man broke her heart. - That is false! - Well, tell the truth. I was heading to my new position when I heard it announced that Captain Ossip Gonovitch he had been promoted to commander of my squad. And I stayed as captain. It's a case of archaic anti-female discrimination. Gonovitch is a drunkard. Four planes have collided. He is color blind. He's the worst pilot in my squad. This would not have happened if Stalin were alive. He was not afraid of women. I know how you feel, Captain Kovelenko. - Thanks. - I think it is more complex of what you believe. If you intend to brainwash me, I won't say a word We are not brainwashed. It is a communist procedure, not ours. - I am mute. - He probably lost his temper because there are things that bother him and they disappoint him in communism. Your tortures won't get a lie out of me not in a thousand years. No one is going to torture him for a second. By saying she's disillusioned with communism - I mean your subconscious. - The communists have not. That may be what happens to them. She fled her country because she is fed up of the injustice of its military system, true? I won't say a word. Hi Newt. I'm sorry to break in this way but you forgot to sign my permit. I would appreciate it if it were two weeks and not one. It is the same. It's your hunt, Chuck. I present you to one of our boldest pilots , Captain Lockwood. He forced her down. - How are you? - What's new for the Kremlin? I won't say a word. Sign as a good friend and I leave you alone. Captain Kovelenko will be our guest. - I hope you enjoy your stay. - Western hypocrisy. - There is a lot around here. The comndante Lewis will accompany. Intelligence will need a week to clarify the situation. Colonel. Commander Lewis. Please take me to my cell. This way, miss. - How about? - Uniformed women They confuse me. I don't know whether to kiss them or greet them. - Report from Lieutenant Feasley. - Ahead. Resumen de inka Kovelenko. Page and a half of the "Who's Who" of the Kremlin, five first-order medals, three aviation decorations and a mole at the end of the column. Fantastic. Do you get an idea? I'm watching. Yes sir. One of the Russian heroines and she's on fire with the communists. Imagine what weapon for psychological warfare. The truth about communism according to one of its heroines. This young woman will lend herself to the proper discussion. Arguing with a Russian is like arguing with a record player. I disagree, Chuck. I assign you the mission to soften it. I would love to help you, but you know that in London everything is ready. - You just have to sign here. - Permission denied. - You won't be able to do that. - It is done. In the recruiting office it was not like that. Newt, already explain that to you. Connie's parents, Lord and Lady Warburton-Watts They will go to London to meet me, from Ruginweed, Knockenbaird. - The land of Edward the Confessor. - They will have to postpone the pleasure. You want me to plant the British aristocracy - to flirt with a peasant? - The country needs your talent. - It's an important plan. - You don't understand. Million dollar aristocratic bride . I'm not that young anymore. Maybe it's my last chance - to achieve happiness. - He'll wait for you. - Martyrdom is not bad. - An heiress? It's like not opening the parachute. Would you like to retire in a year and live in a mansion with a pool, horses, yachts ... with everything you want, for free? What do you say to that? - Are you trying to bribe me? - No, I'm inviting a friend over. Tonight you start with Inka Kovelenko. It would fail. I have no incentives. - For patriotism. - Let's stop advertising. We will try. I want you to start Bringing you this bottle of whiskey. Then take her out to dinner and sell her America. I wanted to get vodka, but it didn't fit. Yes, I have heard that Americans have meager rations. Say when. When. - For world peace. - For world peace. Do you dare to openly toast that ? Well, I don't think anyone has heard me. It's not as good as vodka, but outside of Russia, what do you want? I don't want to force her. Thanks. A hole in a girl, right? You have been assigned to disarm me. - Isn't that true? - If you want to cooperate. I thought they would send a taller man. - It may grow. - He has a funny face. It matched the body. He has specks in his eyes. I only use them to see. We do not quarrel, we have to endure. Do you mind repeating your name to me? - Chuck Lockwood. - Chuck. It has a Slavic sound. When I get angry I get thirsty. - The calm. - Yes, it relaxes me. That's what I'm here for. Happy anesthesia. To live, darling. Why do you call me "honey"? - It is an insult? - No. It's an informal word. It means comrade. Thanks. I like you... Dear. I will have dinner with you. How many times have you flown over the North Pole? A. If you've seen one north pole, you've seen them all. I've flown over it seven times. At what maximum speed have you flown? - A 800 km/h. - Yo a 1.200. - With plane or without? - I'm one of the best three. Maria Elynova is more famous than me, but I am younger. Why don't you ask me to dance? I thought that minor feats were not for you . Yes I love to dance. masters. Please. Chuck, come on. - What is your strategy, Captain? - I am now between suicide and desertion. - ¡Chuck! - oy. I'm coming. - How are you doing, Chuck? - Kremlin 7 Lockwood nothing and a half. - Good luck. - Yes, may the best man win. Wings down, this is a small victory. You are amazing. Because American women are shallow. They are basically interested in nail polish and fake breasts. Yes, they usually make mountains out of a molehill. I must say... I do not understand how a man of your intelligence and sensitivity he is not communist. My habitat is to blame. You are a victim of capitalist propaganda. Yes, a sucker. Honey, despite those medals, you're fine. Soft as a bunny's ear . Thanks love. If I could take you to Moscow ... Thanks. If I took you to Moscow, like an American who prefers peace to war, freedom to bourgeois slavery ... it would be a great honor for me. If I could persuade an American to fight for peace ... I don't see myself prepared for that. I understand. Spiritual changes take time. - How long do you think? - Well, I highly doubt that I ... - You want to give me a hand? - Ideologically. - Well, captain, I have an idea. - Yes? I couldn't read those books in the barracks, in front of everyone. - Would they form a court martial for you? - Yes. If you came to London ... - I'm a prisoner. - I'll fix that. - The colonel will give you parole. - With what excuse? I'll tell him that you want to study the wonders of democracy that you try to become adept because it is better than communist tyranny. Do you think the colonel will be fooled by such nonsense? If he eats in the army, he'll swallow anything. What was I saying, Lewis? I am never wrong with a woman. Round one and the Russian lady is on the ropes. You have my permission to try to mislead him. I too will be deceptive for the cause. Then from London We will fly to Moscow together. Let's drink for it. - Through Moscow together. - Through Moscow together. Now, the KO. masters, commander. - Please don't get up. - You are standing, Colonel. - Can we join? - Sit down please. This is a kind of official ceremony with no bureaucracy, Captain. Here's a taste of the esteem of the American Army. - What is this? - A check for a hundred thousand dollars. - Nothing, the parrot's chocolate. - It's written. It is not even printed. Yes, he needed the go-ahead from Washington. It is the bonus we give to Russian pilots fleeing the Iron Curtain. Please, if you want to bribe me, please at least not treat me like an idiot giving me a worthless piece of paper signed by a certain John Smith. He is our financial manager. That role, captain, is the promise of that sum in any bank. Promises, that's the only thing the West knows how to give. You never find anything real like in Russia, not real money. Sorry, inka. Considering our discussion, I think it would be advisable for you to take the check. At least until you have it clear. Okay, colonel. Thanks for the check, Chuck. You'll see, Uncle Sam has a big heart. Don't forget I want to see you later. - We'll talk tomorrow, Captain. - If you wish. I'll keep it as a souvenir for you to see in Moscow Which is actually American money. Have you tried taking her to New York? We have argued for an hour. I have not been able to convince her. He keeps saying, "Take me to London. Maybe in London I want to listen. " oy to approve your idea. - It was not mine, but yours. - I'll give you five thousand for expenses. Give him a chance to throw money away. Nothing brainwashes a woman like money. Forget Connie and her parents. I don't think I have time for that. This requires total concentration. I'm glad to see that you notice. I've alerted the department. All eyes will be on you. Even in the White House. The White House! They shouldn't look so much at the Democrats. Good luck, captain. ace to make history. Thanks, Newt. If I haven't been back in seven days ... - Yes? - Send more money. SOLETIC COMMERCIAL MISSION Enraged by Ossip Gonovitch's promotion to commander, Inka Kovelenko left the Prosen airfield at 14:00 on Wednesday. - That was yesterday. - At 4:00 p.m. ... At 4:00 p.m. on Thursday, Kovelenko left Berlin for London on an American plane with an American pilot, - Captain Lockwood. - Kidnapping of a Soviet citizen. We will demand excuses from Washington, to the UN and the British government. Not good. - Why not? - It's not politics, it's a love affair. Aya, do you have any information, Colonel Sklarnoff? They have reserved separate rooms at the Pall Mall. Separate rooms? - What love affair is that? - One in the first phase. What's that? That he is not ready. Colonel Sklarnoff ... Wait, I have to change the tape. Why does Kovelenko fly to London and call herself a deserter? if he is not ready? With a woman in love, there are no explanations, only solutions. I suggest we send two good men to that Pall Mall Hotel with instructions to end this adventure. Not good. We must avoid unfavorable publicity. Inka Kovelenko is one of our heroines. His arrest would cause the disappointment of the younger generation. A true communist is never disappointed. - Please, Dubratz. - If our great Stalin ... No philosophy, please. I myself have the solution. She has come to see her lover, a member of our delegation. Where are we going to find a lover here? - Has Ivan Kropotkin arrived? - Yes sir. Good. Bring him in. - Do you keep someone up your sleeve? - Fire versus fire. - Are you Ivan Kropotkin? - Yes sir.

He let me hold his hand. That's all? - Yes sir. - You will have a very delicate mission. I'm ready sir! To start with, you have to shave. Follow me I take you to the last step, but I do not see it advisable. I understand. It will take 20 minutes. I will hurry. Don't worry, I've waited longer while on duty. Connie is very glad you came. - I'm Tony Mallard, his cousin. - How are you? - They have spoken to me very well of you. - I hope to get over it. - Connie won't be long. - Will you have the marriage license? He has asked me to give it to you. Do you want to read it? I don't want to rewrite it, I just want to sign it. - I don't even want to see the fine print. - Oy to rush her. Thanks a lot. Charles! My love! I was not expecting you. - Was it tonight? - That's what the days I have crossed out say. How adorable! - What do we do with Hamlet? - Does it give you problems too? We were going to the theater. To a special charity function. Tony, do you mind putting Charles up? - Good idea. - I can not. The colonel is waiting for me. - Can't you phone him? - Aryan generals, an admiral ... it is an important meeting. I have only come to say hello. - Hello. - We won't need him anymore. Good. I'll see her at the north pole. If I go back, I'll ask for you. Good night, little brother. That man looks like a spy. Careful. Look for the Free World Library. It will be the first thing we do tomorrow. Good. Wait here. In the section with more gallons. - In which? - Forget it. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Proceed. - Yes sir. Hello, inka. Are you surprised to see me? - Yes. - I'm with the Soviet Commercial. You were always a businessman. - As time goes. - Yes, we get old. - You do not. - You're going to start again. I wasn't dressed because she was taking my picture. Why would I take a nude photo of you? For medical research. My spine has a unique position. For me you can pose for whoever you want. Olga Yahupitz doesn't mean anything to me anymore . Not even for me. A fat blonde with a cushion face. I feel nothing but contempt for you and her. For you, more. I hate deception. - You despise me? - Yes. I feel at home again. Mom asks me incessantly: "Where is Inka?" And I always answer him: "It's in my heart." Yes, along with Olga Uahupitz, Fedya Tulabov and Anna Krantzmeyer. In your heart you can only stand. Your face reminds me of how vile even a Russian can be. You have given me new hope. Thanks. Fixed up. The luggage is upstairs. I stay at the hotel. I forgot to see you. Captain Lockwood, Commander Kropotkin, - an ex-friend. - Charming ... oy to ask your opinion ... About the US Please be honest. - I'll do what I can. - What percentage of starvation occurs among American workers ? How difficult. As far as I know they die of thirst, not hunger. is? They hide the data from you. In 1954, the 28th / of the mortality of American workers it was due to starvation. - Go figure! - Not counting the children who died for lack of milk. "Pravda" revealed the data - last month. - What is that pamphlet called? "The hundred lies of capitalism." - What an incisive title. - What is the percentage of illegitimate children born in the US? I should know, averages are good for me. Twenty-seven percent. During the war it was worse. One American child in three he has no father. We couldn't get cigarettes either. We drink something? Tell me frankly Have I impressed you baby? - Tremendously. - In what sense? Your sincerity. - What else? - Your way of carrying alcohol. That's all? Your brain. I've never met a woman with your brain. - Thanks. - Inside such a pretty head. I kiss you like a soldier. - What happens? - I don't usually kiss soldiers. Now let's go to bed. - We? - Yes. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. We will continue in the morning. Okay, teacher, what time is class? At dawn. We must not waste time. - Goodnight. - Sleep well. - I will do that. - Are you going to bed? - I think so. - Is... locked that door? - Usually yes. - Then go over there. - I will see you in the morning. - Yes. Forgives. - Do you have the key? - Yes here. I was worried. Goodnight. Allow me, sir. Thanks. I've brought you this in case you're cold. - Thanks. - Sneakers. And a toothbrush. No, please, I use a washcloth. But I will try the toothbrush as in an experiment. - Goodnight. - I am very grateful. - Goodnight. - See you tomorrow. - Early. Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Hello. - I always read before going to bed. - Me too. - That's what I thought. It is entitled: "The capital of the spiral economy." - Oh. - It's a bit deep, but if you read it twice, it becomes clearer. Sounds like fun. - Do you have something to read? - Yes, my criminology. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. If there is something you don't understand ask me tomorrow. I guess I will have a lot of questions. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. I'm coming! Hello, honey ... Honey! What a surprise! I was not expecting you. - Do not? - Not you. How about Hamlet? - Very interesting. - Really? You prefer Russian ballet, right? Me? Lots of Lauratilobas in long underwear? Do not. We have seen a friend of Connie's, one Bill Brandon. It belongs to the Military Intelligence. He told us you brought your Russian dancer to London . - Excuse me, ma'am. - You want? - The key to the inner door. - From what door? The one that overlooks the adjoining rooms . Thanks. That will be more comfortable. The truth is that I am on a secret mission. Do you know ...? You're not listening to me. I'm on a secret mission. - The Russian girl is an official matter. - It sure implies secret non-military meetings. That is unfair. It is not like you. - I serve my country. - Why didn't you tell me? I didn't want you to be late for Hamlet. I like this plot better. If we don't have the kill at the end. What is your official business with her? I try to attract her to our side, to teach her democracy. But you already know... how are the Russians. They are always screaming ... They are crazy to tie, they hate the people of the outside. They believe that freedom is for the birds. - How is? - They're always arguing. I asked you a question. - How is? - Personally? Don't worry about inka in that regard. He's square, he's wearing boots and pants. He always covers himself up like an Eskimo. It is a human ice cube. It has a 98º / of Russian and a 2º / of woman. - You know that I ... - Honey, I wish that ... I'm sorry for the meddling. I think I was wrong in the percentages. Captain Kovelenko, this is Lady Warburton-Watts. - Thanks. - And Mr. Mallard. Well ... how about Ivan? Do you know something? - No. - That Ivan looks great. - Do you sleep with this? - Naturally. Are they badges of good behavior? No. For breaking the sound barrier , 1953. First solo trip to the North Pole , 1954. That is your main interest, the North Pole. Well, it will seem that there is a lot of current. Good to know you're still wearing your pants. I've come to see if you can give me your clothes to wash. - I work in the bathtub. - The hotel takes care of that. - I'm much better. - I only have a dirty shirt and ... Thanks. The rest later, please. Goodnight. Goodnight. Well, drink. You cannot be jealous of a washerwoman who haunts the North Pole. Always rolling the bearskins. Yes, you don't have time for anything else. I understand that what that Brandon says bothers you. I would feel the same, but it is not true. We must advance the wedding. Perfect! You will see if you want to ask someone. Yes, I'll think about it. Look to see. My love. Hope you don't get soap in your eyes. Goodnight. Those medals must be awkward at times. Yes. Where is Curzon Place 223, the New World Bookstore? Go through Curzon Arcade. The second on the right. - Shall we take a taxi? - No, it's a lovely day. I prefer to walk. Do you think that this type of adornment is important in sex? Dressings don't bother me. I am against it. A woman should attract a man with your personality, not with edging. Don't you think? It depends on what those piping are attached to . Feudal symbols of wealth wrested from the masses, that's what they are. How much does one say cost? - The pink? - No, the black lace one. - It's very good. oy to ask. - We are not going. - Why do you smile? - I think how good it would do you. I am not in mourning. But it's spring, doesn't it make the Russians react? Yes. We are glad to know that the wheat has started to grow. and that work resumes on the northern levees. Siberia in spring. It must be the peel. Yes. Since we are on the subject, Do you mind telling me who it was? - Who are you talking about? - That low-cut woman from last night. - Oh, Lady Warburton-Watts. - It's called like that, but what does it mean? She is nothing more than a London capitalist. It gave me the impression that you were lovers. - He's not my type, honey. - Too low-cut? No, I do n't care , it's not hot enough. Understand. I ask because ... reminds me of a woman that I knew, Olga Yahupitz. Sorry if I insulted you with my suspicions. I will be tolerant about it. FREE WORLD LIBRARY It is like an oasis in the middle of the desert. I have the list. You better wait outside. They could arrest me just for looking in the window. Senator Howely, you will not regret leaving the Geneva conference for this propaganda project. I'm always happy to turn down a peace conference. My record is clean as a whistle. That Kovelenko will weaken communism more than 40 years of summits. - Oh oh. - Your colonel, he's after us. Too late, he has seen us. - Act with indifference. - I have a diploma in counterintelligence. If you have problems, swallow this. - How are you? - Colonel Tarbell. - Perfectly, thank you. - I came to see how everything was going. - How is our student doing? - I'm impressed with ... Sugar Ray Robinson y el Boston Tea Party. I try to make the classes interesting. Well, it's a good start. - Books, huh? What have they bought? - Old things. The arrival of Columbus, the Mohawk uprising, - things like that. - Excellent. - Do not apologize. - I told him about private property. - Books are our castle. - Yes. I see. Senator Howely is with me. He just got back from Washington. Head our inka campaign. - What's that? - An intrepid investigator of ours. Tonight we will have a party to introduce Captain Kovelenko to the senator. Let's say... at eight o'clock? In her honor, we will celebrate her in "The Russian Bear". - What's that? A restaurant? - Very chic, by the way. It is very luxurious. Couldn't we go to a nicer inn? Nerd. I'll be there. At eight o'clock. - I have to go study. - Good girl. Colonel. Sorry, honey. Comandante Lewis. Lockwood, no, Lewis. - Its busy. Can I help you? - Do you know where we have dinner tonight? In "The Russian Bear". At eight o'clock. You're welcome. Goodbye Sir. Hello. Can I help you with something? I would like to buy something. Something of lingerie? The one with black lace. A negligee? - Is a negligee long? - Depending on who's looking at it. The black lace is up to here, from here. It was in the window. The Cleopatra set. Black lace with bobbin trims with a scarlet ribbon. - Can I see it, please? - Of course. - Why don't you sit down? - Thanks. Do you imagine yourself in blue? I have what you are looking for. I want the black lace. What reason is he. It's more of his style. Made for you. I buy. - How much is it? - Thirty pounds. - Is he taking it? - Yes please. - Is there something else, miss ...? - Captain Kovelenko. We have some lovely red garters , captain. No. - The "Eureka" bra! - What's that? Is it for swimming? - It can be carried in the water. - Is it in front or behind? In front. He teases me. It is not for swimming. It is a fake breast. - Bra for short. - So that's how it's done ... The illusions of democracy! Who is your hairdresser? How does it take so long? He may have taken the polar route. 20 minutes is nothing. They like to entertain themselves before a party. - Brushing the boots? - Maybe he'll stand us up. I trust less a Russian than a horse. They are all spies. Watch out, senator. They can add something to the vodka. - I'll be right back. - Good. What's the point of dragging a spy toward us? Do you want to have vodka? - Yes good idea. - Of course not. Bourbon. I did not know that there were so many communists. They sure are harmless. - Are you Captain Lockwood? - No, he will come right away. - Oh, can I help you? - We are guests of the captain. Connie, I'm going to find him. - Stop, I'll go find you. - Are you Russians? Don't worry, senator, they don't need a test. - I'll be right back. - Would you mind sitting there? You've been court-martialed. - There must be an error. - You lied to me. I couldn't lie to you. You are a very clever psychologist. - We have to get in together. - What do you mean? We are not interested in the senator investigating. I would like to know if your habit of driving on the left has some political meaning or it's just another one of his bloody things. Hey, what a fun group! I'm glad you have come. It is an important mission. - The senator told me. - I've invited her to join us. We all long to help civilize your barefoot washerwoman. ¡ inka! aya ... You didn't tell me your middle name was Cinderellavitch. This is how a self-respecting pilot should dress . - Captain, dear. - How are you? Sorry for the delay. Absolutely. May I introduce you to Lady ...? We all know each other, except that man ... Captain Kovelenko, Senator Howely of Alabama. I've heard of Robert E. Lee. He was a good revolutionary. My opinion of the Russians has grown in a matter of seconds. - Do you want a drink, inka? - A jug, half champagne, - half vodka. - Waiter. Two pitchers, half champagne, half vodka. - And water for everyone. - That's the "Moscow Minuet". - I'm glad. - Where did you find the fairy godmother? There were many. They have worked hard. Do you like the effect? - It affects me a lot. - I'm sorry we didn't study together. Everything takes so long. The hands, the hairstyle, the stockings, the shoes. In the end I came back and bought the garters. - Don't tell me you're wearing red garters. - Yes, they are very attractive. still very good with black lace. Llévenos de gira, Srta. Kovelenko.

How he looks at me! He laughs at me with those predatory bourgeois eyes of his. - Why are you laughing? - You are crazy. Nobody laughs at you. - Do I look weird? - You are precious. - I'm very thin on top. - It is fashionable. - I have very long fingers. - We'll shrink them. I feel like a box of paper flowers. - You have the right to laugh at me. - Now it is OK. You are a roar. what do you mean? It's like honey, but in a bikini. Thanks, thunderous. I'm glad that you admire me - Yes it's correct. - If what is true? That you admire me Totally. That's good. I have fixed myself for you. I wanted you to know that when you come to Moscow with me you wouldn't miss out on female sex and beauty. We have both. They make a great team. Senator, we drive on the left so that the driver has a free hand from the gun in case highwaymen attack . Tell me the theory behind the curtain's wage bill, honey. Let's save it for when we're alone. It has gone to the other side. What do you think? Correct. - Traitor. - You see. We lose ground. Goodnight. Is it still here? Is dancing. I am wearing your favorite flower. The blue batchelor.

In our army there is no class distinction. Take for example Chuck Lockwood. - With pleasure. - I say it because I am his friend, an absolute homeless. Not a penny to his name. But he has high regard, as if he were a millionaire. Why should a millionaire be highly regarded? Fast! Senator! - Is there a safe place for this? - The dresser. - Where is that? - It's that door over there. - inka! - I want to talk to you. I'll take it, baby.

Dear Lord Warburton-Watts, I hereby show you my sincere apologies for any inconvenience that his precious daughter, Constance, has suffered , due to an unavoidable technical failure of an employee of mine. I return her with a special escort. I hope that the friendship between our great nations does not ... - It has escaped! - Don't bother me, I'm going to return it! - No, the other one! Kovelenko. Of the hotel. - They were there? We still needed to cover the fire escape. - Idiots! - We were following instructions. - You morons! - We have given the alert. Collect your belongings from the hotel. Alert Group Eleven. - The whole group? - You have to find her and silence her. Thanks. I have not slept. I have taken off one suit and put on the other. - What does he want? - I want to see Colonel Sklarnoff, - Head of the M ... D. - Impossible. And I haven't had breakfast. It is the same again. You have to make an appointment. - What is this? - Kovelenko. We have arrested her. Why didn't he say who he was? Everybody up. I will announce it. Steadfast! March on! Meeting of the special tribunal of the M ... D. Dr. Dubratz, can you speak to your client. As your attorney, I suggest you confess totally and openly. - The fact that? - His betrayal. I don't have to confess any betrayal. If you prefer, I'll plead imbalance. - It could save your life. - I'm not unbalanced. That is a very broad statement. The consultation is over. Declaration of the prisoner. Innocent. - And what does that mean? - Innocent. Let the prisoner step forward. Is it Inka Kovelenko from the Soviet air force? When did you decide to betray the Communist Party? Since I entered at the age of eleven, I have never had an anti-communist thought. Last Wednesday, he defected from the air force, he stole a plane and fled to the American zone to meet his lover. ¿Erdadero the false? - Fake. - I ask permission for a clarification. Granted. The reference of my American lover ... it is false. I have no American lover. Don't you know an American captain named Charles Lockwood? I know it, - and I despise it. - Last night he clung to him, They danced for three hours and melted on his shoulder. ¿Erdadero the false? - I despise it. - It's enough. I beg the court to let my client finish. I assure you that it is over. The court has indisputable evidence of his betrayal. - That Captain Lockwood ... - Hush! If you allow it, you are stripping your soul. I hold a check found in Inka Kovelenko's wallet. In your name. One hundred thousand dollars. Signed by Officer John Smith. There is also a photograph in which she appears with her lover. One hundred thousand dollars. It is a worthless piece of paper. I kept it as a souvenir. It is the price of his betrayal of the Soviet. - That's a lie! - In exchange for that money, he was going to tour the West lying about his own country. That claim is ridiculous. You may find my next statement less ridiculous. As judges of this special court of the M ... D., we found the prisoner guilty of treason to the USSR. And we sentence her to death. The sentence will be carried out in Moscow in the next 24 hours. We have lost. The prisoner is allowed to make a statement. I only have one statement to make. If this is Soviet justice, I am mute. ...incompetence. Captain Lockwood. - They arrive very early. - Cocktail brain! - They beat me. - Sir, they just informed us that Kovelenko has been arrested by the Russian secret police and judged of treason by a military court. - What was the verdict? - Guilty, sir. - The death penalty! - We are sunk. - It was my fault. - The Department will blame me. What does the State Department matter ? It was me. I have killed her. I am an assasin. I have sentenced a person to death . Sir, my political career is hanging by a thread. - Go away ... We must be consistent, Senator. We could not do anything. They followed her since she arrived in London. One of the judges occupied the suite next door, Commander Ivan Kropotkin. Almost half of the taxes people in Alabama pay It is intended for the maintenance of the army. And this is the ineptitude that we receive in return. - Is that Kropotkin still here? - They told me you just arrived. - Kropotkin! But ... - Shut up, Senator. Maybe if we play well, we can find out about this inka. amos. Commander Kropotkin? I am Captain Lockwood. - I can enter? - I'm going now. Give me just five minutes. I can prove that Inka Kovelenko is innocent. - Too late. - Has she been sentenced to death? One moment. This is a trick I learned in high school. Pick up on this. - Why did you do it, comrade? - It still works. He is not guilty. I was working for you. - For us? - Yes. I was converting to communism. That's what he came to London for, to convert me. We lied to that filthy capitalist my colonel. Have you betrayed your colonel? More than that, I've ridiculed him. And the State Department as well. That is their fault convert to communism. It has reformed me. It has made me see the truth of communism. The hundred lies of capitalism. I know. One in three children does not have a father. - It is awful! - This would not be believed nor MacArthy. Always nice to meet a supporter. I'm not a sympathizer, I'm red. - It's his doing. - Comrade, you have made me very happy. You will be a monument to his memory. He will replace her in the fight for communism. - Goodbye. - Wait! - They'll have to try her again! - No, comrade. Nothing can change Soviet justice. Now they will take her to the airport. And will return to Moscow for justice to triumph. - Hey! - Stay where you are. - I have to ... - You're under arrest. You are joking. ¡Eh! ¡Lockwood! Captain Lockwood, I wish to see Colonel Sklarnoff. - He has an appointment? - Tell the colonel I'm here. No date? Get out, please. - Wait a minute, ma'am. - Out of. One moment. I demand to see your superiors immediately. - It's not allowed. - It won't stop me. What does this mean? One moment. I don't want to hurt you, ma'am. It will serve as a lesson. And the referee? - Colonel Sklarnoff! - Do you know this man, Maria? - No. - Lockwood, captain of the FF AA. Charmed. - Charmed. - Maria, let him stand up. Time. I wouldn't do that if I was wearing glasses. - Can I help you? - I want to see Colonel Sklarnoff. Over here please. And I want revenge. Please sit down. Thanks. Colonel Sklarnoff? I engo on behalf of the American Armed Forces AA . I must tell you something and I thought that maybe you ... Colonel Sklarnoff? I'm from the US Air Force Headquarters. I'm here on a very important mission and ... Colonel Sklarnoff? If I don't see him there will be a terrible international tension. That's the man, Colonel Sklarnoff. I am Colonel Sklarnoff. How are you, Colonel? I would like to talk to you. Can... talk privately somewhere? They will not listen. Proceed, we are alone. What will they not hear? - No. - Good thing, because it's confidential And I don't want to ... Well, I'll tell you what's officially there. I have been delegated by my superior, Colonel Tarbell, to demand the immediate return of our prisoner, forcibly taken from American custody. You may not know that Kovelenko violated our territorial limits. Kovelenko inka arrested on May 2 by Lockwood Charles. iolation, chapter I, clause III. I promise... Broadcast from American headquarters , Colonel. - Put it on. - On behalf of the United States and Newton ... This is Colonel Tarbell in command of the US Armed Forces. We ask for your help in capturing a prisoner who has fled, Captain Charles Lockwood. It measures 1.80, He has brown hair and weighs 80 kg. He's desperate and his nose is turned up. Turn off. Put me through to Colonel Tarbell. Everything you said is false. It is a slander. His stupidity is only surpassed by his beloved Kovelenko, whom they take to Moscow, where she will be executed for treason. - No, that's ... - The colonel on the phone. - I'll talk to him. - Hold him. - I thought they weren't listening. - Colonel Tarbell? This is Sklarnoff. We have the captain in custody at the Russian Trade Delegation. - What do you want us to do with him? - Look. I do not matter. The one that matters is inka. That's what I wanted to talk to you about. Newt! Very good. We will do that. Let him be in the waiting room until the American police arrive. - Bring the prisoner. - One minute and I'll prove your innocence. - It couldn't be more red. - You follow his orders. Give me just ... Don't give me anything. I'll take this higher I'll take him to the UN. There must be some healthy country in the world. They can't ... They'll see when I catch them outside. Our plane has arrived at the airport. High or tall. It's fine. - Take her to the car. - I would like you to give me permission to carry the hat down the street. Of course, we are still on foreign soil. - Thanks. - We're leaving in ten minutes. Left. Nice waiting room. No magazines. Are you an American officer? Captain. Burtons. How are you doing in the American Army? Charles Lockwood, Captain of the Air Force. Number 46712 ... and I do not know what else. Colonel, how long do you want inka Kovelenko's obituary? Not very long. Do you object if I call her "The Soviet princess of heaven"? "Princess" is not a pretty word. Of course. Excuse me. It's hard to get into the American Army without knowing someone from above. I'll fix it. - Free? - Yes. There are precisely two vacancies. I have a cousin in the Brooklyn Army . - One of the best regiments. - Alyo Paskinevski. - Couldn't it be Al Paski? - Do you know him? One of the most popular officers on Ebbots. Are you an officer? He wrote saying he was a soldier. - When was that? - Two months ago. It takes two months to become a captain, four a colonel ... Then it slows down. You know, politics. - In Russia it also happens. - Do not tell me? - How much does a soldier charge? - At first? - One hundred dollars a week. - American dollars? They are the only ones we use. A month, 50 more. We are losing time. If they really want to enlist. - We mean it. - I admit immediately. - Can do it? - I'm from Military Induction. That's why I got into this mess. They accuse me of taking a $ 5,000 bribe from someone who wanted to break in. But I'll prove my innocence when I get out. Attention. Do they abide by the rules of the US military in war and in peace? - We don't want to fight Russia. - Maybe not necessary. - I'll put it in a clause. - We abide by them. They must obey the orders of their superiors - without question. - We promise. I appoint them first-class soldiers of the United States. - That's good. - When my cousin finds out ... Attention! La Addition. Turn around. Make way. Ahead. On going. One two. Colonel Sklarnoff and company. They are waiting for us. Well sir. Gate 9. Wait. Do not move. Say nothing.

Ossip Gonovitch. ¡No! - Be quiet! - I demand my rights as an officer. - What rights? - You must execute me in Moscow a firing squad, not in the air at the hands of a clumsy pilot. I will not lower myself by responding to an enemy of the people. - Quiet! - We are still in a foreign land. - We should go now. - I need a permit to fly. - Send the copilot. - There is no. I'll be right back. Excuse me Can I help you? Where do they seal the documentation? Yours? I can see her? What about the building behind the bus?

Dr. Dubratz, be good and ask your client to fly the plane. The colonel wants to know if you will grant us the honor of piloting. Yes, I'd rather delay my killing until we get to Moscow. Do you agree. - Commander Kropotkin. - I'm here, sir. Inform the commander that you are co-piloting the plane. And the prisoner Kovelenko's guard . Yes sir. Excuse me, Commander Gonovitch. Give control to Captain Kovelenko. It's an order from Colonel Sklarnoff. In addition, he is responsible for the custody of the prisoner. ¡Muévase, Gonovitch! Inka, I would like to express my deep pain and my admiration. Thanks for the expression. It was a bad day for the Soviet air force the day Ossip Gonovitch was born. It's okay now, Gonovitch. - Why so many revolutions? - Don't get tired, darling, it's all bad. Do not worry. We will land in Berlin, in the American zone. I don't understand their behavior. Kiss an enemy of the people! - He's drunk, Colonel. - I await your explanation, Commander. He's almost blind, Colonel. - I was afraid of it. - Let me explain ... Shut up! will smell Moscow. If you try any tricks, I will kill your lover. none. You have a lot to learn to be a host. Kidnapper! Saboteur! Fascist hyena! Spy! Go on, I'm over there. - And assassin of Commander Gonovitch. - Me? You've been reading Mickey Spilleane. Tell the Kremlin we have an American terrorist and we have thwarted a mass murder. Say you are Kovelenko's co-conspirator in London. A triumph of propaganda. Double execution. Running is their national sport . Try baseball. It's more fun and the players last longer. - Be quiet! - They have a great agricultural plan, but they are not going to plant me. I am an American and a soldier. They don't take this for a coward. They'll find out ... That is fast service. Don't worry, they can't change our hearts. No, just fill them with bullets, that's all. - Don't be afraid, darling. - Who is scared? I like to walk with you, darling. Thanks. This walk will not be long. Let's slow down.
