Subtitle ReEdited by ♪ ALEX FOX ♪ - Back at the Seaview resort for Shoprite LPGA classic, just outside Atlantic city, Galloway township, New Jersey where we have a beauty on our hands right now. Zoe Papadopoulos trying to break back into that winner's circle for a very promising career that has gone a little wayward of late, trying to hold off, or actually catch in this case Nicole Castrale, a prolific winner on the LPGA tour. It's not a tough putt. She's got a lot out of her game today and made plenty of putts on these inconsistent Greens at times, but this is a big one here, final hole. For the win, did she hit it? Oh, but she left it just short. That's a certain par, tap-in for Nicole Castrale. Now, all the pressure switches back to Zoe Papadopoulos. She now has three feet to force a playoff and we'll see if she can get those nerves under control. Trying to settle herself down. It's just a routine putt, it's only three feet, it's straight uphill. She could make it with her eyes closed. Not a word being spoken. You could hear a pin drop in the gallery. Oh, hit the lip again. Oh my word. - Damn. - She just buried the putter in the green, that's an unforgivable sin for golfers and the worst display of sportsmanship I have ever seen. This is a complete meltdown. No, burying that putter in the green is almost a certain suspension for a very long time. - Okay. Not so fast. - Where are you going? - Okay. - Thank you. - Calling to drop me, Derek? - Drop, no, why, because of the thing? - Yes, Derek, because of the humiliating myself and ruining my career thing, Jesus. - Everybody wants you, everybody. - What are you talking about? - ESPN, GMA, Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, Kelly Meyers, the list goes on. That little meltdown you had, it went viral. Everybody wants a piece of you, honey. - No, no way. - No, no way, everybody thinks you went a little crazy. I try to keep a little low, but if you go on these shows and show you a little humility and a little contrition... - don't use words you don't understand. - Hey, hey, doll face, it's my job to turn this into a positive, okay? Go home, have a dr... - this is good here. Holy mother of god! Zoe! You give a heart attack, Zoe. I didn't know it was you. - I'm sorry, Yiayia - who is it? - Your granddaughter! - How did you get here, why didn't you call? - Hi, Pappous. My love! - How did you get here? Why didn't you call? I would have come to the airport. I asked her this already. - I know, I know, I'm sorry. It was just a spur of the moment decision. I just really wanted to see you guys. This place hasn't changed at all. That's because someone doesn't fix what he's asked to fix. I work all day long, woman. - All day long with the newspaper. - Whatever. - But where is the boyfriend you wrote us about, Zoe? - He's not in the picture anymore. - Why, what did the bastard do? Take Zoe's things to her room, this is none of your business. That's what I'm doing. - Oh, no, it's okay, Pappous, I got it. - It's okay. I have to fix these steps. Someone might kill himself. Watch your step. Come on. Unpack and we'll eat when you're ready. Very good, Pappou. I'll be there. Good morning. Good morning! - We were going to send for the doctor. Oil the tray. - I'm sorry, is there any coffee? - Coffee. - It smells amazing in here. It's the sugar cookies. - You must eat something. Athletes need energy. - Athletes. What are you grumbling about, old man? - Now, I know you never wanted to believe it, Pappous, but golf is a sport. - We have missed our little Zoe. It was been too many years since your last visit. I hope you can have a long stay with us this time. - Oh, I can stay a week, 10 days at the most. A week? What kind of visit is this? Stop it. - What your Pappous means is it's wonderful to see you and we will enjoy whatever time we have together. - Hey! Hey! You need to be more safer. Golf is played in a green grass. Not the sea where you can make people dead. Hello? You speak Greek? - I do, but I think you don't. - Why aren't you playing on a golf course like a normal person? - I'm not allowed to play there. - Probably 'cause you're a hazard. - No, I know how to play, better than anyone in this village. - Oh, really, and who taught you the game? You know, you really should be using a wedge. Me? A skip shot. Watch. - Father. Katarina. - Excuse me, Marcos, a moment. - You remember my famous granddaughter from America? - Of course I do. - We have been following your career somewhat, Zoe, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too. - Zoe, father Anthony also knows the golf. - Hardly. I spent some time in America and some of my friends there are big golfers, not pros like you, of course. - Zoe is on her way to play a pro tournament in Dubai. - So, your suspension was a short one, that is a good news. - Suspension? Tell me of this suspension. - I meant to tell you about all of this earlier, Yia Yia. I'm really sorry, I needed to clear my head first. - Clear your head of what, what trouble? - What is going on? - Zoe was suspended. - Okay, how do I say this in Greek? Um.. I lose game. I go crazy. Um... Then I make myself the ass. I wanted to see my family... because I feel too bad. Sit down, sit down. - It's okay, Zoe, it's okay. Don't worry about this golf, it is nothing. No, no, golf is very important for Zoe. We want to hear, tell us. - I could sum it all up in one sentence, I have the yips. - Yips? - What are yips? - It's a kind of golf curse. It means I can't putt, if I can't putt, I can't play, there's no more tour for me. - Well, maybe the time for golf is over, maybe it's time for something new. - What your Pappous means is we want you to stay here as long as you like. We have golf course here, you 'member? - How can I forget? It's the first place dad ever took me to play. I haven't been there is so long. - Yeah, you don't wanna go there, trust me. It is owned by a rude American and run by a Greek idiot. - What does it matter, it's still a proper golf course where Zoe can practice her yips. Eh? Eh? - Well, this is quite a golf course, Panos. - I'm glad to hear it, sir. - Kinda like playing in your own backyard. Got the whole place to yourself. - Privacy is very important, sir - you know what it reminds me of, Panos? Peeing in a dark suit. You get this warm feeling, but nobody notices. - Yes. - You see, I didn't pay a small fortune to have my own private golf course. I bought this thing because I wanted to make some money. - Yes, yes, making money is very important, sir. - Will you explain to me how I'm suppose to make some money when there's not one blessed golfer out here? Oh my god. Are those sheep, really? I've got big plans for this Panayiotis and if you wanna be involved, then you get this house in order and you turn this ship around. - I'm really sorry, sir. I just didn't know when you want to begun the renovation, but now I know it and from tomorrow morning, I will start renovate everything. We can hire a golf professional or... - do I look like the guy who gives a rat's ass how you do it? Next time I come back here, I wanna see this place filled with paying golfers. - Excuse me, sir. - Don't make me sorry I hired you Panayiotis. - I apologize, everything will be better, I promise. Why did you bring the sheep here! You're killing me! What do you want? Money? Always money? Oh! Come on! How did you get in here? Thank you. - How did you do it? - Oh, hello, again. - Father Anthony said you're professional golfer from LPGA. Is it true? - This is true. My name is Zoe Papadopoulos. - I'm Stella. - Well, nice to meet you, Stella. Now, how did I do what exactly? - Hit the shot the other day, I want to know how you did it. - Well, that's a tough question. I mean, you never quite know how good a shot's gonna be, do you? You can do all the preparation and line everything up just right and poof, you get a fat shot into the rough, you know? Or, practice. - I practice everyday, but it's hard to come perfect because I don't have a course to use. - Oh, right, you said you weren't allowed? It can't be because you're young 'cause I was about your age and I played there. - No, you have to pay a lot of money if you wanna play. - But what about clinics? Don't they have free golf lessons for kids? Mmm-mm. - This book is in Greek, but you don't speak Greek. - So you keep reminding me. I used to speak and read it pretty well. I spent many summers here growing up, but now my Greek is you know, I think I've managed to get through two whole pages. - Okay, I'll help you with your Greek and in exchange, you will give me golf lessons. - Oh, Stella, I'm sorry, but like you said, we don't have a course to play on and I'm afraid I'm not gonna be here much longer anyway. You know what I could do, I could work with you on your swing, we don't need a course for that. - Hello, miss. Hello. - Hello. - Hello, hi. Hi, my name is Panayiotis Manalakis, people call me Panos. I'm the manager of colossus golf course. You're Zoe Papadopoulos, right? - Right. - Well, it's a great honor to meet a golf superstar such as yourself. - Whoa, easy there. - I have a proposal for you. I want to invite you to run a golf clinic for the summer. - Oh, I'm not gonna be here... - okay, you're a big star and we can use your expertise, but... I hear also you have putting problems, right? - It's nothing I can't manage. - Listen, listen, if you come work at the course, you will be able to practice your game without pressure and then when your suspension is over, you can return to the tour better than ever. You see, good for me and good for you. - Look. I appreciate the offer, but no, thank you. - Listen, we have great plans for this place, listen. Just come and visit the course. You may change your mind. Mmm. - Zoe. - Yeah? - What is a matter with you? Are you making down again? - Yia Yia. Yiayia, this Galaktoboureko make me dying of the happiness. We used to make it together when you were young, remember? I do. I remember the entire kitchen smelling like sugar and everything in the world just seemed right. - Yes. - That's why I married her, her cooking tricked me. - Hey, do you guys know a little girl in town named Stella? Cute girl, maybe 10 or 11, extremely serious. Could it be Stella Roussos, Marcos' daughter? - Ah, Marcos Russos, yes, the widower. - He and his daughter live near the prophet Ilias, why do you ask? - Well, I've seen her at the beach a few times and she says she's teaching herself golf. - I thought she was a bright girl. - Pappous. So, where exactly do they live? Hello? Hi. Stella lives this house? My Yiayia says true but don't know. - Yes, you definitely don't know. - Thank god you speak English, I'm not even sure what I just said. - What matters is that you're in the right place. - Oh, good. - You are Zoe Papadopoulos the famous professional golfer and my daughter's new hero. I'm Marcos Russos, pleasure. - It's nice to meet you. I keep running into your Stella, so I just thought I should come over and properly introduce myself. - Well, thank you. Well, she tells me she will be teaching you Greek. - Yes. - From what I can tell it's a great idea. - I know, it's so embarrassing. - Look who's here. - Oh, hi, Stella. - Hello. - She tells me you have the most perfect golf swing she's ever seen. - Oh, wow, I don't know about that, but thank you, I'm very flattered. You know, she's quite the little golfer herself. - You wanna come in? - Okay, thank you. I can't believe I'm eating another piece of this, it's obscene. - So, you were born in America? - Chicago, but my father's from here. We used to come here and visit my grandparents every summer. Actually, the first time I picked up a golf club was here at colossus. - Oh, yes? And how long are you staying this time? - Long enough to help me with my drive, Baba. We have a lesson set for tomorrow. - Really? - Yes, well, your daughter is very focused and very persuasive. - Yeah, that she is. Okay, love... say goodnight to miss Papadopoulos and go finish your homework. Goodnight, Zoe. Thank you for the dessert. - You're so welcome, I'll see you tomorrow. Goodnight. - I feel I should thank you. - Well, I'll pass it on to my grandmother. I can't take credit for her Galaktoboureko. - No, no, I wanna thank you for your kindness towards my daughter. - Well, it's my pleasure. She's a very bright and dedicated girl. - I just don't want you to feel that you have to spend all of your time with her. You're here visiting your family. - No, no, don't worry, it's just hitting a few golf balls. It'll be fun. - Relax. Come on, let's try again. - Are you sure you wanna keep playing with just this one club? - I have no choice, it's the only one I have. - Really, where did you get it from anyway? - Some tourist boy left it behind. - I don't know, Stella. I mean, you really need a course to play on and a full set of clubs. I mean, this cliff and that five iron are only gonna take you so far. - I told you... - I know, I know, but listen, if you truly wanna learn, you have to believe there's a way. Never give up, okay. Now, I can't promise anything, but I think I might have an idea. - Thomas. Thomas. - Where's the fire? - I'm not paying you to read, okay? - I hardly notice you were paying me at all to be honest. - You're very lucky to have a job, we are lucky. So, you're gonna clean this up and to have discussion for improvements, Henderson wants this place filled with golfers. - This place, this place filled with golfers? Oh, it's a crazy dream. - It's not a joke. We have two months to start showing a profit, okay? Otherwise we're out of business. - Okay, I'll get right on it. - Hi. - Oh, hello, you must be lost. - Ms. Papadopoulos, welcome. I'm so happy to see you again. Ms. Papadopoulos is a professional golfer from the United States. - Oh, the cavalry come to save us, good luck. - And Thomas is our greenskeeper and have a lot of work to do. Go, Thomas. So, when can we start? - Oh, wait, hold on, not so fast, I have... - excuse me, it's Henderson and give Ms. Papadopoulos a tour and I'll be right back, I'm sorry. - So, you wanna have a look around our little sinking ship? - Oh, Mr. Henderson. How nice to hear from you this fine day. - How about we cut the crap, Pano? Are things shaping up out there? - Of course, sir, I've just hired a golf pro. - What's his name? - His name, sir? - Yeah, tough question, what's his name? - His name is car, Carter, Zach Carter, yes, Zach Carter. - Where did you find him? - Well, this is a very interesting and complicated story, sir. - Well, how about you give me the three second version? - Yes, of course, sir. He was working in Elle's club in Dubai and he needed a change of scenery, so I hired him immediately. - Excellent, excellent, but you know what, Pano? I just decided I'm not gonna fire you. - Oh, thank you very much, Mr. Henderson, thank you, really, very much, thank you. - I'm all in. - You are all in. - The course looks a little different than I remember it. - How do you remember it? - Beautiful, no? - Well, you certainly can't beat the views. On the other hand, that clubhouse could maybe use a fresh coat of paint. - Fresh coat of paint? Yeah, well, that is viewing the glass half full. - So, have you thought about my offer? - I have, yes. - And? - I'm interested. - You are? - If we can make a deal. - What did you have in mind? - A few things. I'm free to go whenever I want, no contract, no commitments. - Deal. - I can use the course whenever I want. - Deal. - I run all the clinics by my own rules and I take a 10% commission. - Deal. - But. - Always there's a but. - None of the villagers have to pay. - Well, what? - Look, you can charge tourists and out-of-towners anything you want, I don't care, but locals play for free. - I'm afraid that's impossible, Ms. Papadopoulos. - Well, I'm afraid it's non-negotiable, Mr. Malakis. I mean, Mr. Manalakis. - Pano, Pano, what are you worried about? Come on, the villagers hardly ever play golf anyway, even when the town owned the course. I mean, I'm sure they'd be happy to live out the rest of their days never playing golf. - Don't worry, I can bring you some paying customers. It's just not gonna be the locals. Deal? Good morning! Good morning! I thought I'd be up before you guys. - This is nothing to wish for, Zoe, the earlier you riser, that means the older you are. It's a fact. - You want to help us with the bread? - Absolutely. But you're gonna have to remind me what to do. It's been a while. - You never forget how to make bread. It's like riding a bicycle. Just throw your hands in, there's no wrong way. - Okay. You guys must have hands of steel. You have to use your whole body and you won't get tired. - It is supposed to be an "Agonas" Zoe, you know "Agonas" struggle. The dough is like life you see, you give it everything you have and after you've done all you can with it, then what? You release it into the fire, so that something new can become of it, something better, bread, but this transformation is only possible with a struggle, then after that, the letting go. - I hope for nothing, I fear nothing, I am free. - Bravo. - Thank you. - Stella. - Baba. - Is that haralambous's bread? - It is, would you like some? - Please, thank you, it is heavenly. - You know, we should hit some balls sometime, father. I'd love to see you play. In fact, I'm running a clinic this weekend. - Clinic, do you mean at the colossus? - It's a temporary position. - I could definitely use a few pointers, but... - a few pointers about? - Well, I'm teaching a clinic this weekend at the golf course. Stella's invited, of course, if she wants to come. - Well, there's no question of her wanting to. - Well, it's free for locals. It'll be fun. - Does Panayiotis know about this? - Of course, he loves the idea. - Well, then, I gladly accept. - Good. - I can safely say that Stella gladly accepts, too. Come on, let's go to bed. You are drunk. - Hey, there I am. - So, wait, you're telling me that your illustrious if presently somewhat compromised career began here? - Yeah, that's my dad. I guess that's why I can't help, but have a soft spot for this place. I just want everyone to love it as much as I do. - Yeah, well, good luck with that. - What, you don't think that we can bring people around to caring about colossus? - Oh, whoa, what's this we business, Ms. America? Firstly, it's your fool's errand, should you wish to pursue it, and secondly, I think these people care too much. It's pride. There lies the problem. - There are people here for your clinic. Two people on the course, zero euro in the cash register. - Hey! - I remember the first time that I watched a game. It was so quiet, so much focus. It felt like the players were all having a religious experience. I had to see for myself how hard can it be to hit a ball into a hole. Well, of course, I soon found out. Well, any idea how we get other locals to come out and play? - It might be a little tricky. The course belonged to the villagers, you know, and even though most people didn't play here, we have always been very proud to own it. It was a terrible blow when the crisis forced us to sell it to Mr. Henderson. So, people might not like it if they think you're working on his behalf. - But I hardly think offering free clinics is working on Henderson's behalf. I mean, I just love the game, I wanna share it, that's all. - Let's see what we can do. I would like to remind you that next week we have organized a trip to Panormitis at SIMI. And for everyone who may not know, Zoe Papadopoulos has begin to offering a free golf clinic for everyone who wants to learn to play golf at the lovely local course. And I understand there will be free food and free drinks at the clinic. - So, what do you think? Was that a positive response back there or negative one? - No, time will tell. I'm going to Aliki's house, okay? Yes, but be back at three. No, please at four... - Three, my love! - Okay, at four it is! - How about you? Any interest in coming to one of my clinics? - Me? - Yeah. No, thanks, but no, it's not for me. Stella enjoyed herself very much, though. - I just thought that maybe your daughter would've infected you both with golf-mania. - I'm afraid I don't have the Patience for such a game. You have to be so quiet and it takes all day to play. - Yeah, my dad was the one who played golf in my family. He taught me and my mom the game, not just the rules and how to swing the club, but the philosophical aspects, too, what he called the soul of the game. - The soul of the game, that's very poetic. - Yup, that's my dad, a true poet philosopher. I miss him and my mom every single day, but I like to think that the golf gods wanted them to be together. - The golf gods? - Yeah. My father decided that all of the ancient Greek gods now watch over golfers. You know, since they don't have anything better to do these days. It's kinda crazy, right? - Yeah, but a good kinda crazy, the crazy that lightens the spirit. I could have used that back when I was an attorney in Athens. Oh my god, I was so serious, and even though I was married, it was as if I had nothing else to do in my life but work. - I know that feeling. So, when did you make the transition from lawyer to teacher? - Well, Stella came first into our lives, so we wanted her to grow up near family, we move back to the village and that's when I started working at Panayiotis' law firm in rose town. - Wait, Panayiotis Manalakis, he was a lawyer? - Yes, actually, a very good one, but then the crisis took many things away from all of us, so I start teaching and I love it. So, I'm right here. I guess I'll see you again. - Okay. - Bye. - Bye. - I'm so sorry. - Sorry. - Good. Make sure your arms and shoulders move as one like a pendulum. Grab another. Good. - Yay, almost, very nice. - Keep the putter between the two lines, grab another. - How she doing? - We're getting there. Good, just don't break your wrists. - Have you ever hit a hole in one? - Yes, many times, but it's always a surprise when it happens. - Do you have a favorite course to play on? - Really, my favorite course is always changing. Right now, I'd say pebble beach, but if you ask me again, it might be some place else. You're going to tire Zoe with so many questions. No, I don't mind, what else? - Why did you go crazy? That is not a nice thing to say! - I'm so sorry. - No, you know, it's fine, I did go crazy and I've been at this game a long time and when you work so hard at something you really care about, the bad times can get a bit dramatic. - Okay. - Okay. My god, I'm so sorry. - I hope for nothing, I fear nothing, I am free. Are you okay? - I'm not sure Henderson is gonna be okay with any of these changes. - You are joking me? This place is virtually a palace now compared to what it was. People are no longer embarrassed to be seen playing here. Look at the reservation book. - 90 rounds this week. Six new annual memberships. Plus 40 reservations for next week. How did this happen? - Mostly the remodel and I called in a few favors. Oh, and I got you a little writeup in golf digest online, too. - Oh, I could kiss you both. - I'll pass on that. - Hey, has anyone shown up yet for the clinic? - Well, no, of course not. - The who does what? - It's football. - Zoe! - Hey, everyone. - Thomas, Thomas. - I'll be at the bar. - Just a reminder that we still have the free clinic going on at the golf course right... So, they lost, big deal. - Football is a game we care deeply about, Zoe. - Okay, but golf should be, too. - Name one good reason. - Besides the fact that it's a sport you can actually play your entire life unlike soccer. - Football. - Football, and on a golf course right here in your own village nonetheless, I'll give you all the best reason there is, it's Greek. - Oh god, someone's more pissed than me. - Oh, no, no, no, hear me out. Greeks invented everything, right? - Not everything. - Most everything. - Well, golf is one of the things they invented. - Well, as a subject of the UK, I do feel compelled to point out it was actually the Scots. Well, a kilt looks an awful lot like a fustanella to me. - Yeah, actually, bagpipes are mentioned in the odyssey. - Yes. And the name Scotland comes from the Greek "Skotia" which is the Greek word for the land of darkness. Their patron Saint is our San Andreas and his cross appears on their flag which happens to have the same colors as our flag. - I think that's stretching it a little bit. - And if you go back even further before Scotland existed, you've got the development of geometry, philosophy, physics, all concepts rooted in ancient Greece, all essential to the game of golf, and then there's the influence of the Greek gods. I mean, you have Hephaestus who forges our mighty clubs and Athena who gives us the wisdom to choose our shots and Apollo who guides our aim. - Dionysus who inspired this brilliantly insane conversation, allow me, Zoe. - Please. - Poseidon who tests and tortures us with his hazardous water. - Ares who gives us energy. - Yes, Pappous. - You're aware we no longer believe in these gods? - Not literally, maybe, but they're still a part of the Greek psyche. - Then why don't the Greeks play golf? - I don't know. I mean, maybe we get so caught up in our past, sometimes we forget to appreciate the present, but in golf, the present is all that matters. Nothing else exists. No failures. No disappointments. It's just you and the ball, the green, everything else falls off. Anyway, do you really want the Scots to take all the credit for this glorious game when everything it represents is key to the Greek mind and soul? No. What about Henderson? I mean, he might own colossus, but he doesn't own golf, right? No! Right, so make the game yours. I want you to go out there, hit some balls, and rediscover your roots. - Yes. - Here are the purchase orders you asked for. Oh, and I'm taking these, so just take 'em out of my commission. - Do you want tsipouro? It's good for hangover. - God, no, I'm never touching that stuff again. - Okay, but I'm telling you, dog's hair is the only cure. - Well, I rather suffer, it'll pass. - Some suffering does not pass. The Henderson kind of suffering, working for this man is worse than any hangover. - Then why do you do it? - Money. If I could make the course profitable, I could be an equal partner. - Well then, why are you so upset? You have more customers now than you've probably ever had. - Everybody hates me, the whole village, I have no one. The only girl I ever loved married somebody else, my parents are long gone, my brother is abroad, and last year, my dog, she left, I have no one except Henderson, this greedy snake, a lying pig. - Panayiotis, you either had too much of that stuff or not nearly enough. - Wow. Great shot, Agapi. - Hey. - Hey. - I thought I'd find you here. Marcos, you on the other hand I didn't expect to see. What brings you to Stella's cliff? - I wanted to show Baba my special place. - I see. I have something here for you. - Really? - That's too generous of you, Zoe, thank you. - No, Stella deserves them. So, wanna have a little lesson today? - Can I please, Baba? - Sure, sure, I'll just stand out of the way. - Let's see. Okay, I want you to grab the seven iron. Today's lesson is this, you're gonna tee off with your eyes closed. - What, that's impossible. - Nothing's impossible, you can do this, Stella. You just have to believe it, close your eyes. Go ahead. Ok, Now, I want you to feel the sun on your face. Hear the sound of the waves. Smell the salt in the air. And imagine yourself hitting the perfect shot. If you can envision yourself taking the perfect swing, really seeing and hearing yourself connect with the ball, anything is possible. Now. See the shot in your head. Take a deep breath. Exhale. And swing away. Woo! - Bravo. Great shot, bravo, Agapi! - Baba, did you see, I can golf with my eyes closed? - How did you know she can hit the ball without looking at it? - I have a confession to make. I actually didn't know for sure. - What? - Yeah? - Come on, that could have been a disaster. - Yeah, I know, I know, but, I mean, don't you find that the best things in life come when you're one step away from catastrophe? You know, like when you take a risk. - Yeah, I think I know what you mean. - Pappous, what are you all doing here? - We are here for the clinic. And the free food! - Okay. Before we begin let us bow our heads in prayer. Dear lord, guide this flock of virgin golfers to replace their divots. Teach them to not stand in front of other golfers when they're hitting. Remind them to rake all traps. Compel them to yell "fore" when they ball may strike someone's head. May they enjoy the fruits of the game and not kill anyone. Amen. - Amen. - Let the chaos begin. - Please stop with your balls. Hold your balls. So how do you win a golf game? I'll tell you... You throw your balls, they get in the hole, and if... What if you throw too hard and it goes really far? Cheers! So you throw it 900 feet away and then what? - Then you lose... - No, you get another ball. - You either win or lose... - No, it's very simple... You throw it from here, it goes over there... Then I get my ball and I run like hell... We try to get the balls into the holes! Cheers! - Oh my god, it's him. - Who? - Henderson. Henderson! Get out of here now! All of you! - What's going on here, Pano? Who are all these people? - Hi, you must be Mr. Henderson, can I get you something to eat or drink? - Who are you? - I'm your pro, Zoe Papadopoulos. - Zoe Papadopoulos, you hired Zoe Papadopoulos as the golf pro? The meltdown queen of the LPGA? What were you gonna do? To hold a clinic on golf etiquette? - Everything okay here, Glenn? - Yeah, everything's fine, this has nothing to do with our deal. - Deal? What deal, sir? - You know, maybe today really isn't the kinda day we should be doing this. We'll try it again tomorrow. Antonopoulos would you take these guys back to the yacht, please? - Deal, what are you talking about, sir? - None of your goddamn business. - I thought we were partners. - Oh, we're not partners. You're fired. - What? - And that goes for Ms. yips, too. You can relax because your little village is about to become a world-class destination. I'm selling this property to those two gentlemen there and they're gonna build a five star golf resort. - You're selling. - Sir, you just bought it. - It's gonna be a kind of a club med here. We're gonna have a hotel, shopping, resort, restaurants, there's even gonna be a waterpark, and maybe you could find yourself a job flipping burgers at one of the many convenient poolside cafes. As for the rest of you, get the hell outta here. This place is closed. - Wow, you really know how to liven up a party. - Are you okay? - Of course not, son of a bitch. - Panayiotis, we can fix this. - Oh, come on, how can I fix this? He has the money, the power, the glory. - You have the power of your own. We all have the power! - Sorry, what are you guys talking about? - Come on, don't you remember? All the work. - Come with me. - What, where we're going? - Panayiotis, what is this mess? - What exactly are you guys looking for? - My weapon. - What? - I'm going to destroy him. - Look, this is not a solution. Violence isn't the answer. - Here, I found it, the contract. Panayiotis represented the town in the land purchase. It's the last deal we made before closing the firm. - I'm done with him, this cheap, lying, gambling-addicted bastard. Be quiet, please! Quiet! Sit down! Quiet! Shut up! The mayor is speaking! Come on, mayor. We're here to discuss... The options to Mr. Henderson's development plans. What are our legal rights? Options? Rights? What rights could we have after that idiot Panayiotis signed them all away? I have the contract. Quiet, you! You're the one who got us into this mess. - Come on, let him talk, give him a chance. - The contract says, "notwithstanding the sale of the property "by the buyer at any future date, "all development right are hereby exclusively reserved "by the village named herein "and therefore any and all new development of the property, "both now and in perpetuity shall be subject "to the full approval of the same." Understand it? What the hell does that mean? Listen, listen. Henderson cannot go through with his plans unless we allow it, okay? - That hotel and the new building and the parking lot, the last thing they do is put it in. All right, Roland, stay with me on this. I'm thinking luxury suites right here to take advantage of the five star oceanfront view and then we go shopping, shopping, shopping, and then on that pad, that one up there, is where the Aegean sea finally comes to face to face with its natural enemy, the waterpark. Oh my god. It's the village people. It's like a scene out of a movie, but they usually come with torches and pitchforks. Excuse me, people, you are, Antonopoulos, come here. Would you please tell them in gibberish that they're trespassing on private property? He wants you to give up your own land. The barbarian. Thank you very much, that was very heartfelt, what he said. - You might want to read again the contract, Mr. Henderson, there is a clause in it that protect this land even from you. You cannot hammer a single nail without our permission. And we do not give him the permission. Do we? No! - Bullshit. All right, it's a technicality. I'm willing to deal with some legal issues. - That's your choice, but I can personally guarantee we will keep you in courts for years. - Is that so? Well, I'm guessing that by the time you Greeks get your shit together, I will have made this sale, they will have filled in this place with concrete and we'll all have ourselves a really nice ribbon-cutting. - I hear you're a gambling man, Mr. Henderson. Maybe there's another way we can settle this. - And what would that be? - I don't know, maybe a simple golf match between you and me. - How stupid do I look, you're a pro. - A pro with questionable mental health as you so kindly put it and a bad case of the yips. - Unless maybe you're afraid of losing to a woman. - All right, I'll bite, what are the stakes? - You win, you make your sale, and they can build whatever they like. - And if I lose? - Ownership of the property reverts back to the village. Do we have a deal? - One change. I want somebody who will properly represent the village, somebody who's got a little skin in the game, somebody who was born here. Where you born here, Ms. Papadopoulos, I think not. - It's a little unfair given they just learned the game. - Yeah, isn't that a shame? Their player for their property, that's my deal. Any takers? I didn't think so. So, if you don't mind, I'm gonna excuse myself and I can call and have you arrested or you can turn around and leave the way you came. - Wait. I'll play you. - Stella. - I can win, Baba. - You've got to be kidding me. You people are pathetic, you're embarrassing yourselves. - You're right, why don't we ask the village? How do you feel about Stella representing us? - Yes! - Yeah, of course. - I think you have your answer. So, do we have a bet? Goodnight, Baba. I want you to know I'm very proud of you. You're much braver than I am. I wish mama could be here to see me beat the American. She'll be watching you from above... And she'll be proud of you, too. Goodnight, my angel. Goodnight, Baba. - I must be out of my mind letting her do this. If she loses... - she won't lose. - He's an adult, Zoe, he's a mature man who has been playing this game for who knows how long, the whole idea to me is really absurd. - Wait, listen, I've been doing a lot of research on Glenn Henderson's game, at best, he's a five handicap, and Panayiotis said he didn't even shoot par at colossus. - Say it in English, what does this mean? - It means that she can take him, Marcos. She has a chance to win. - Hi, Derek. - Finally, you pick up, I've been trying to reach you forever. - I know, I'm sorry, I just really needed to unplug. - I wanted to let you know your suspension is over. - Really? - Yeah, they dropped it a week ago, so come into my office tomorrow, I've got a few dates lined up. - I kind of have tournament here tomorrow. - Where is here? I don't know what you're doing. - Relax, Derek, it's not a paying gig. - Is this charity again, Zoe? I hate when you do charity. - Derek, besides, I'm not even playing, I'm just being a caddie. - Oh god, this is worse than I thought. - Would you stop? - Okay, call me when you get back, hopefully that's soon. - I will. Goodnight. - Ouzo, I love the way that sounds. - I want this business deal done. - Roland, you're getting all of this pristine oceanfront property for 20 cents on the dollar. I've gotta be crazy for selling it to you for that price and you know that. You work your developmental magic on this, you're gonna have a piece of property that's worth 10 times what you paid for it, 10 times. - Shall we begin, Mr. Henderson? - All right, come on, gentlemen, let's go have some fun. Well, it looks like we've got ourselves a gallery. Stand aside, everyone, I take large steps. - Welcome, everyone and "kalimera". - "Kalimera". For today, format will be an 18 hole match play between Mr. Glenn Henderson and our very own Stella Russos. I will serve as today's referee. Now, we shall flip to see who goes first. - Why don't we dispense with the formalities there, padre? I'll tee off first. Owner's prerogative. Keep that close. I'd bet you'd like a piece of that. - It's called sportsmanship, my friends. - Just go play your game, Stella, you got this, okay? - That had so much box. It's okay. - Do you wanna sweeten the pot a little bit, say, $100 a hole? I'll just play for a box of thin mints. Oh, like a god. Don't hand out titles easily. Oh, that's a shame. She's been spraying that ball all over the frontline, legs are probably getting a little tired now, too. Hey, Roland, see the top of that hill, that flat pad up there, that is where you put the waterpark. - Oh, nice. Jackass! - Wait, there's a word I recognize. Defeat sounds the same in any language. You'd know all about that, though, wouldn't ya? Zoe with the sign of a Z, washed up has-been pro that's relegated now to caddying for a child. Boy, I'd say your life has hit an all-time low. - Yeah, well, you're an all-time low. - After nine holes, Mr. Henderson is four up. What happened? Why is she angry? - What is that, the ancient Grecian rattle torture? - God and I both saw that, Mr. Henderson. - Really? Well, I'll tell you what, I'll deal with god later, how about a small donation to your church that says you didn't? - I'm afraid it doesn't work that way. - Come on, padre, do we have a deal? - Now, you'll be hitting your second shot, Mr. Henderson. - They will never find your body. - No, my five iron for everything. - Everything? - Yes, have a little faith, okay? - I don't have a little faith. I don't even have a lot of faith. What you have, Stella, is all of my faith. - You're Goliath and I'm David, I will watch you fall. - Feeling any pressure, Henderson. - I don't feel pressure. Some people get headaches, I like to give 'em. Give me a nine iron. Get down. Get down. Get down. - Out of bounds. Out of bounds. You're killing me! - I asked for a nine iron not a six iron. Bozo. - That is a one stroke penalty. You'll be hitting your first shot from the field. - You son of a bitch. - All even with only one hole to play. - Whoops. Cocktails. What can I say, it's a gift, and I've gotta share it. - Okay, you might be in the bunker, Stella, come on. - Now, that's why god made a nine iron because that's how far it's supposed to go. - Relax, you can hit the green from here. It's okay, you can still make the putt. Stella, Stella! Stella, what happened? - What happened, Agapi? - I hit something hard under the sand. - Come on, let's get you out, come on. - Great, can't dig anywhere in this country without discovering an ancient city. - How good are you at lining up a gimme, padre? - The child is hurt. The game is over. - Gentleman, let's go sign a contract. - Wait. Let me hit the putt. - You? - And I'll sweeten the deal with a little side bet. All of last year's tour earnings if I miss and I'll use the five iron. - Oh, this is like the perfect storm? - Come on, you're a gambling man. What, are you afraid of me? - Afraid of you? You're on. You don't mind if I just finish my birdie, do you? - Be my guest. - My par. All yours, Princess. I hope for nothing. I fear nothing. I am free. - Shit. Guys. Guys, hold on. "A golf star is born" - good morning, hotshot. Good morning! - Good morning! - Is she okay with you? - Yeah, of course. Actually, I wanted to talk to you anyway, might be my only chance before all your admirers start crowding in. You can keep that. - That's okay, my father bought about 25 this morning. - I bet he did. - What do you want to talk about? - Well. It's just that... It's time for me to leave. I gotta go back out on tour. - When? - Tomorrow. Love, do you want a lemonade or something? Stella. - What happened? - My suspension got lifted. I told her it was time for me to leave. - Okay. - Stella. - She'll be fine. She just needs more time. - I didn't mean to upset her, I feel really terrible. I just thought it'd be best if I told her the news myself. - Of course it was, Zoe. You had to be the one to tell her. You see, for Stella, when people leave, she can't help but think it's going to be forever. - But it's not gonna be forever. I plan to come back a lot more often. - It's only fair that you follow your dream, not just for yourself, but for others you inspire. Like Stella. - Look, I don't know how to explain it, but the game means everything to me. But I'll miss everything. - She'll miss you. I'm gonna miss you. - Here, this is for your journey. As you know, when we make bread, we don't think of anything else, the bread is all that exists, it is also the same with golf, is it true? - Yes, Pappous, it's true. It's the soul of the game. - Okay, you two. It's time to go. Have a good trip! Bye! Take care, Zoe! Don't forget us. Come back soon! Have a safe trip! - Could you pull over for a second, please? Just right up here. Could you pop the trunk, please? When friends are about to be separated, it's a golf custom that they make a wish and hit balls at the same time, so they cross each other in the sky and Grant our wishes. - It grants wishes? - That's what my father always said. - When will you be back? - As soon as the tour season's over, so no more skipping school like you did today, okay? - Okay. - Otherwise your dad's not gonna let you help me run my next clinic and I need you. - Okay, I promise. - Remember when you asked me what my favorite course was? - Yes, you said it was always changing. - Not anymore. - One day, we will never be separated. - How is that? - When I turn pro, you can be my caddie. - Ah, I see, you better pay me well. - Half of what I get and I will never fire you. - Caddie for life, huh? - Well, we'll be like partners except I will get all the trophies. - Partners. I like that. Okay, ready? Now, close your eyes.
