where is she? only my sister would be late to her own surprise party. Sorry, I took so long. It's just-- hey, it's okay. Just tell me you're on the way. Paul, we need to talk about something-- grace, what was that? Talk to me! Grace! What's going on? 'get her out of there!' somebody call the doctor! - Somebody call the.. - Grace! - 'paul!' - grace! - Grace! - Give me the phone. Grace! 'it's really day to day right now.' now is the time for us to have an honest conversation. 'it just..' 'you gave us quite a scare.' mom! I'm gonna go call paul. I'll be right back. just relax. You're gonna be alright. 'you just rest.' so we're gonna keep an eye on those scans. Okay? 'everything's going in the right direction.' 'sorry, I'm late.' what did I miss? 'are you okay?' do you recognize this man, grace? I think so. Um.. You're that guy from tv, right? That relationship guru guy? Well, yes he is, but is there anything else? wait.. And you're my husband. That's right. Th-that's not funny! haven't you put me through enough? I couldn't help myself. I must say that a sense of humor after such a traumatic event is a wonderful sign. I was just telling your wife that her most recent scans show that her swelling has almost completely subsided and she doesn't appear to have lost any executive function which is remarkable. Did you hear that? I was officially diagnosed with being remarkable. I already knew that. Aw. Where's taylor? - I'm dying to see her. - She's on her way. She was at her boyfriend's 'when I called her with the good news.' nice try. I wasn't in a coma that long. What do you mean? These three months have felt like a lifetime. 'exactly. Three months.' I would've had to be gone a lot longer than that for you to try to trick me into believing that our daughter 'is old enough to a drive a car and have a boyfriend.' is this another one of your jokes? What? Mom! Taylor? she's.. You're not.. Mom, are you okay? I can't get over how grown up you look. The last thing I remember, you were only 12. I'm 17. That's five years! Memory loss is normal. It-it takes time. Okay? I thought that we were going home? we are home, baby. - Really? - Yeah. Oh, wow! - Yeah. - Okay. - Good to go? - Yeah. Wow! I've always dreamed of owning this painting. This is like the-the first time all over again. oh, my goodness! I can't believe that we live here. Paul, your career must've really taken off. Well, I can't complain. You know your company has taken off as well. You've acquired quite the celebrity mom clientele over the past few years. - Are you serious? - Well, yeah, yeah. Why.. Why do you think I was so upset about your accident? I was hoping that you would be my sugar mama. - Oh! Is that right? - 'mm-hm.' - welcome home, sis! For you. - Oh, thank you. - It's good to see you. Yes. - Mmm. Thank you. - Hey, girl. - Hey, aunt lisa. Your sister has really stepped up and been a god send since your accident. She's practically been living here. You know, helping taylor and I manage your company so it was here when you returned. - Really? - Yes. I am capable of being a mature adult, you know? No, I didn't mean that, it's just.. Anyhow, thank you. Mom, come up here. I wanna show you something. Oh, okay. Ah, sweetie, would you put these in some water? - Yep. - Okay. Thank you. 'just go through this little hallway and I'll meet you..' - actually, I was gonna get you. - 'okay.' okay, stay there. - Right this way. - Okay. - Tada! - Oh, wow! Oh, my gosh! Look at us. I still have a lot of other videos and stuff that I wanna show you on my phone but I read online that printed images help trigger part of the brain that digital doesn't, so.. I just wanted to make sure all your bases were covered. How did I get blessed with such an amazing daughter? Oh, I don't know about that. I was kind of a brat the past year so you don't need to remember that. Are you kidding? I want to remember it all. Okay, but don't say I didn't warn you. - There's more of it here, too. - Oh! - Grandma's birthday. - Oh! - 'did we go horseback riding?' - yeah. - I bet that was fun. - Oh, it was so much fun, mom. - look at you and dad! - I know, look. Thank you, baby. I love this. Baby, I love this. that parrot would not be quiet. And it would sing with you. 'you did duets together.' ♪ mary had a little lamb ♪♪ 'anyway, enough.' another toast, for my beloved daughter! - You're home! - Yay! - Thank you. Love you. - I love you. - I love you, mom. - I love you. Mm. Mm. - Wait a second. What is this? - 'what?' - purple hair? - Oh, yeah. Yeah, when I did that you literally said to me "young lady, you are grounded until you graduate high school." oh, my god. I knew you'd be the one to turn out like mom. Hey, there's nothing wrong with that. Yeah, and you just wait until you have a kid that does this to her hair. - Hey, I like it. - Thank you. I had a similar hairstyle when I was in my early 20s when I was back-packing through europe. - It was amazing. - It was horrible! - It was cool. - Horrible! hello? 'I can't wait to kiss you again.' ah, you have the wrong number. Some guy wanting to kiss his girlfriend. - That's weird. - Lucky girl. Well, give him my number. Come on. 'I could use a phone call like that.' oh. It's like grand central station in here. - I bet you it's thad. - 'oh.' - who's that? - 'it's her boyfriend.' he's v cute. 'mm-mm-mm.' yes, it is thad. but I'm just gonna text him that I can't talk until later tonight. Why? You're finished eating. But mom, we're helping you with your memory. Oh, honey, it's going to take a lot more than one dinner to help me remember five years. 'you have plenty of time to help me get back my memories.' listen to your mom, and go talk to your boyfriend or I will. - Oh. - 'oh. I don't trust her.' yeah, you should, because she will. Okay. - Okay, fine. - 'go! Go!' okay. - Run! - Say hi to him for me. - Bye. - Run! - Very sweet. - Run, lisa's coming. oh! - oh, god! - Oh, my god! I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I-it's okay. I was just, um, looking at the view. Oh. God, it's beautiful, isn't it? Yeah. Hey, well, I was just seeing if you need anything before I headed out. Why don't you just stay in the guest bedroom room that taylor told me that you've been using? Oh, no, no, no. It's your first night back. - I don't want to intrude. - Nonsense. From what I hear, I wouldn't have such a settled life to come back to if it weren't for you. have you seen my necklace? Uh, the one that paul gave you? Yeah. My lucky charm. You know, um, you did have it on at the hospital. 'I'll give them a call tomorrow' 'and see if it's in lost and found.' oh, it's really no big deal at all. What're you guys doin' out here? Just trying to convince your aunt to stay over tonight. - What do you think? - Duh! Come in! You coming? Oh. Yeah. So this thad character.. - Do we like him? - Oh! Yeah, he's a good kid. I mean, I like him as much as I like any boy dating my daughter. well, she really likes him. Yeah, I guess. Anyway. About tomorrow's interview. this is why it's happening so fast. We're promoting your new book? I finished it right before the accident. You gave it your seal of approval. - Did I? - You did. Well, then it must be another new york times best seller because I have excellent taste. You do, that's why you picked me. it's true. Okay. - Oh, hello. Mm. - Yeah. Actually, this is an advanced copy. Ah.. My publisher wanted to wait. Obviously, I couldn't do a physical book tour when you're in the hospital and without press they didn't think it'd be a new york times best seller, so.. Yeah. Baby. Oh, god! I really wish that accident never happened. Oh, hey. No, no. Hey, hey, hey. No. Don't even think this is your fault. - Okay? - Okay. Just.. ...Just thankful that you're here. - Heh. - Hm. To be honest, I-I didn't think you would be. Thank you for proving me wrong. Yeah. Well, for that I'm very happy. Honey, I live for proving you wrong. Oh. Oh. and look at this handsome devil. I'm going to dive right in right now.. - Don't you worry about him. - And I'm goin' to read as well. No, I have to read the book now. - I'm handsome right now. - Excuse me. Excuse me. I have to read your new book. and I'm so grateful for all the doctors, nurses and staff. And, of course, my family. We've talked with several of the hospital staff who told us a pretty romantic story 'of a husband who showed up every day.' I guess that's what we all expect from, right? Paul, you've been touted as a relationship guru to the stars 'who saves dozens of marriages.' tell us how you never gave up hope. It all comes out of honesty and trust. Communication is the foundation of our partnership. So not having that for three months was hard but.. ...But I never stopped believing in her. 'and grace, how is the recovery journey going?' I understand there is much of the last five years still missing for you? Yeah. I mean, it's going pretty well, considering. There are still some big gaps. It must be surreal to learn things about your life 'and have no memory of them.' do you remember the accident at all? The doctors don't expect her to ever remember. That said.. ...No one knows my wife better than I do. And I expect her to make a complete recovery. 'doin' all the deliveries? All the prep..' 'you are amazing.' don't be so surprised. I did go to culinary school you know. Okay, maybe for a year, but it still counts. Well, thanks for holding this place together. Did it take you away from another job? Um, no, I was actually in between jobs anyway 'so it really kinda helped me out.' plus, I forgot how much I really loved cooking. And, thanks to your ocd like perfection, all the recipes were written down to a t, so I learned some new recipes which I will steal from you when I gonna open up 'my own business one day.' ah-huh. I don't think so. hi, zoey? Your sister karen.. Alright. There you go. thank you. So.. Did you get a look at the driver? Unm-unm. No. It was probably just some kids pulling a prank or something. Maybe. I did get a text from a private number a few days ago. - It said, you look stunning. - Mm-hm. I don't know, I-I was sitting out here all alone and I swear it felt like someone was watching me. Watching you? It sounds silly when I say it out loud. I don't know. You know, I'm sure that they're unrelated. I just.. I don't know why I'm so paranoid. Dr. Leopardi did say that as your mind is trying to remember things it turns to the imagination to fill in the gaps and make sense of it. Still, if you want to call the police.. No, no. We've so much on our plate. I'm, I'm sure it's nothing. - You sure? Okay. - Mm-hm. Thank you. come on, sweetie. Paul, wake up. Alright. Okay. He was staring right at me. There was someone. Honey, there was someone. I-I saw him. I.. Come on. Come on, honey. There's no one there. I-I.. okay. 'oh, no.' what's wrong? - I have an idea. Mm-hmm. - Mm. Doctor said the best way to trigger your memory is to surround yourself with people and things from your life, right? And, so, why don't I throw you another birthday party? Whoo! You know people, over pictures might work better. Besides, everyone is dying to see you since you've come home. - Yeah. - Kill two birds with one stone. - Ah. - Come on. Come on. - It's worth a shot. - That's my girl. mm, alright. Do you want me to stay home tonight? I can tell my publisher I'm not ready to do press yet. No, you've done enough for me already. Tonight, I just want to sit on the couch with a glass of wine and eat my feelings. - Mm. - Okay. happy birthday, grandma. 'taylor, this is crazy!' 'do you have any other videos of your big momentous moments' like, I don't know, learning how to drive a car, or your first day of high school? Are you kidding? Mom, I'm a teenager. I document everything. Ah, you were ten. Come on. You were so good at this. I don't remember. Ah! ooh! Almost. Oh! - Really? - I can't throw. How does that feel to just have popcorn.. I really missed you, mom. I missed you. And I know your memory's gonna come back. I know it. grace. mom! Taylor! - Baby! - Stay here. It's okay. It's okay. You're safe. I love you. You're safe. Were you able to get a look at his face at all? Ah, it was dark. Everything happened so fast. Notice any distinguishing features? Any tattoos, scars? - No. - No. - No. - No. Was there anything stolen? I don't think so. I came home before that could happen. Sounds like you came home just in time then. Yeah. A house this size, with its all its contents really should have a security system on 24/7. I suggest you keep it on to help prevent something like this from ever happening again. I'm giving you my card, and this is my direct cell number. You remember anything, anything at all.. ...Don't hesitate to call me. Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. oh. We're closed. If you're waiting for my sister, she's on her way. - We better make it quick then. - No, no, no. Stay there. - Grace. Grace, relax. - Seriously! It's me, kyle. Your boyfriend. You're not my boyfriend. I'm married. Ah, true, but not happily. Hence.. - You really don't remember me? - No. Grace, we've been seeing each other since last June. I left my wife for you. You were waiting till taylor graduates in a couple of months to file for divorce. How do you know my daughter's name? you stay right there! Hey, look, I've been texting you on our app since you got discharged but you haven't written back. That's why I texted you on your phone the other night. I-I was careful, and I blocked my number but.. I didn't know what else to do. I waited till paul finally left the house but he came home early and ruined it. That was you? You broke into my house? Whoa! Hey! I did not break in. Alright? I used the key under the fake turtle by the pond. That's how I've always snuck in. Look, check your phone. Alright? There's an app called zen talk. That's what we always used to communicate. It'll prove that everything I am telling you is the truth. Look, I'll leave, please, just check the zen talk. I'm not lying to you, grace. I love you. thank you. The market was crazy today. They were out of like everything. Probably gonna have to change the menu around to make it work. - What's wrong? - Huh? What? Oh. Just another dizzy spell. It's gonna be okay. 'why don't you go home rest. I got this.' hey, I have a question for you. In our old house we used to keep a spare key in a fake rock in the yard, do we still do that? yeah, except at the new house we switched it to a little turtle by the pond. who all knows about it? just you, me and taylor. Why? there's no way the burglar could've been tipped off if that's what you mean. Grace. - 'grace.' - right. Okay. Well, I still think it's probably best if we, uh.. ...We stop doing it for a while. I'm gonna bring it back inside the house. 'okay, cool. Oh, hey, that's my other line.' 'I'mma grab that. I'll see you when I get home.' bye. oh, god! God! - It will all come back.. - Oh! Sorry. - I hope so. - Yeah. There're hardly any photos of us in the last year together. Same as my phone. We didn't take too many trips. You were up to marketing, and your business took off. It was all consuming because you didn't want to hire any help and wanted to do everything yourself. I know. Plus, my practice was stressful with the tv appearances, demanding clients. You know, writing the book.. We weren't having problems, were we? No. No, I.. I mean.. Maybe, maybe we took each other for granted but, you know, what couple doesn't do that? Right. Hey, you know, to be honest I don't care if you remember anything from the past five years. - You don't? - No. I don't wanna live in the past. I.. I wanna focus on creating new memories. Almost lost the chance to ever do that again. - Yeah. - You know? I'd like that. 'I am the luckiest guy in the world?' dad, ew. Don't be cheesy. you look gorgeous. Well, like mother like daughter. - Oh, indeed. - No kidding. - You look beautiful, mom. - So do you. But your neck looks a little bare. Oh, I.. I know it's not your lucky one but it's the exact same necklace and I thought you could wear it until we find the original. Oh. That's so sweet. - You like it? - I love it. 'come on. Let's go.' I don't remember half of these people here, paul. Oh, relax. This isn't meant to be stressful. Mm? No one expects anything from you. We're just all happy that you're alive and healthy. Mmm. - Okay. - There's my publicist. She's gonna wanna grab a couple of shots. Do you mind? Yeah. - Come toward. - Um, sure. - Cheese. You alright? - Okay. Sure. - You good? - Okay. We're good. We're good. Thank you, guys. Alright, thank you. You know, I'll meet you in a second. I'm gonna run to the ladies. come on, grace. Get it together. These are your friends. Your family. hello? No! No! Surprise! No. No! Grace! Grace! Grace, stop! Grace. Grace, grace. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Hey. Hey, sorry, I just wanted to surprise you and try to get some alone time. You used to love it when I brought you roses. Why are you here? Look, I couldn't wait any longer. I wanted to see you. You look beautiful. - Did you check the app? - Yes, but I'm sorry. - I still don't remember you. - Maybe this will help. What're you doing? You have a good evening. - Oh, here's mom. - Oh. - Hello, mom. - Hello. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi, you. Is lisa around? - Hi. 'she's right behind taylor with one of those guys.' I know something that will surprise you. - What? - Or should I say "someone?" who? Yvonne! Oh, my god! Oh, my god! It's so good to see you. So good to see you. You look amazing. Oh! I missed you! 'is that brad and india bates?' - 'where's paul?' - 'he's right over.. Oh-oh.' - I better save that. - Yeah. It's probably wise, honey, unless you want him to start telling thad stories about when you were in diapers. - Oh, no. - No. Can't believe you left me all alone here in la. Please tell me at least that we kept in touch after you moved. Yeah, but not as much. You know how it is. We both were really busy. But we did still find time to vent to each other every now and then. You'd bitch about paul and I'd bitch about henry. Was it ever anything serious about paul? Just typical marriage stuff. You were having trouble finding time for each other but you both also had a lot on your plate. Did I ever confide to you about anything else? - Like what? - Um, I don't know. I'm just trying to piece together the last five years, and you and I used to tell each other everything, so I just.. I figured that if I had any deep dark secrets that you'd be the one to know. If I had any. Nothing significant comes to mind. But like I said, we haven't kept in touch as much as we used to. - We played a lot of phone tag. - Right. Why? Do you remember something? No. I was, I was just curious. - hey. - Hey. Mm. I can't believe that all those people were in that exact same place waiting for me the night of the accident. Yeah. Yeah, it was the worst night of my life. I'm just glad we got to a do over. 'I'll take anything over how the last one ended.' so, lisa still seems to be the life of the party, huh? I mean, I thought at one point I'd have to pull her off of you. You know how she is. You know, she feels like she has to overcompensate when she feels self-conscious. That's, it's totally innocent. Mm. I don't know if innocent's the best word to describe lisa and her effect on men. Oh. Really? Can I let you in on a little secret then? Hm. I wouldn't have any idea about lisa's effect on men because I am totally into her sister. - Oh. Is that right? - Yeah, that's right. mmm. - Ooh. - Mm. it's always nice to have something to hang on to, you know? it was just a nightmare. - Go back to sleep. - Okay. I need to speak to you alone. What is it? Was that kyle that you were with last night? Look, I know about you two. You told me about the affair. What did I tell you? Well, that you and paul were having hard times. You were feeling neglected. Were friends than lovers. And you had met kyle, and fell in love. Look, when kyle came to the hospital I had to lie to the hospital staff to tell them that he was an old family friend. He came to the hospital? Yes! And to see paul so devastated and heartbroken over you and I had to keep a secret about an affair! Honestly, when you woke up and you couldn't remember the last five years, I thought it would be a blessing 'cause we could just move on from everything. And then I saw you kissing kyle last night. It's not what it looked like. Look, I'm not stupid. You obviously remember him. I don't. I swear to you. I thought he was out of his mind when he came to the cafe and told me about the affair. Look, I had lied for you in the past because you're my sister. But I'm not doing it anymore. Paul is a good guy. He loves you. I love him too and I would never wanna hurt him. It's just, I can't fathom leaving him for someone like kyle. I'm not even into the bad boys, you were. Well, maybe that's why you liked him. Because he was so exciting and different. Maybe. But I don't feel that way anymore. Then break it off with him. Lisa, I told him I don't remember him. He's a guy, he's gonna take that as a challenge. You need to let me know that what you two had was a mistake. That the accident was your wake up call. He just thinks that you're confused. You need to convince him that you're not. Sooner rather than later. oh! - Hi. - Hi. I got something for you. Oh. Ah.. I'll put it on you. You know how these clasps can be. oh, right here. Yeah, just come a little closer. there we go. Your good luck charm, right? I'm having a hard time understanding how we would have ever started dating. Where did we meet? We met in san diego at the jai yoga retreat. It was total kismet. Just like in the movies. We spent a magical two days together and that's when we knew we were meant to be. Did you know that I was married? Yeah. Yeah, we were both miserable with our partners. That's one of the first ways we connected, grace. Look, kyle, since I don't remember the last five years it means that I have no emotional attachment to it. So, if I was upset with my husband it's like now there were never any problems between us. And if I fell in love with you as you say well, I don't feel that emotion anymore. What're you saying? I'm sorry. I can't pretend to feel something for you now that I don't. The doctor say that I might never get those memories back. Yeah, but look, we can alw-- but I don't want them! Not those memories anyway. Kyle, whatever we had it was a mistake. How could you say that? Huh? We had a life together. We had a future planned, grace. Don't you understand? Let go of me. is this your sister talking? 'cause she was a total bitch to me when I came to saw you at the hospital. No, she was just being protective. Kyle, I love my husband, and I don't wanna leave him. So, if I said that I would, I'm sorry. But you haven't even given us a chance, grace. - You haven't even tried. - This was a mistake. I shouldn't have come here. Grace. Grace. - Kyle, come on. - Grace, grace, grace. Kyle! You don't get to decide when this is over. I gave up my life for you. My wife. You might not remember what we had, but I do. You're the love of my life and I'm not about to let you go...Ever. Kyle. I'll see you soon. Here you go. - Oh. Thank you. - No problem. If that man was my boyfriend I'd be dropping things when he'd kiss me too. What? Oh, no. He's not my boyfriend. Oh, sorry, husband. God, wish my husband still looked at me like that. You're a very lucky woman. 'the way he talks about us.' I just don't see it. That's 'cause you don't wanna see it, grace. Maybe. I did have a small memory of being with him the other night. - You did? - Yeah. It was a dream. I couldn't put it into context, but it felt real. I didn't have any romantic feeling for him though. It felt completely platonic. It's because it was a dream, grace. You probably just conjured up a picture of what you want the truth to be. As soon as you accept that you just made a mistake we can all just move on from this. So, how did kyle take it when you broke it off with him? Not well. I don't think he's just gonna walk away. Hey, did I ever tell you his last name? Um, no. I don't think I remember it. Why? I feel like I should learn more about him. If I knew his last name, maybe it would trigger my memory could figure out where he works, maybe talk to a co-worker. You did asked me to pick you up from his house one time. So, I'm sure I have the address saved in a text messages somewhere. Would that help? Yeah! Yeah. Thank you! oh, grace. I'm sorry, I didn't know it was you. Kyle left about an hour ago. Wait! Do I know you? Oh, that's right. I'm melanie. I live next door to kyle. I'm sorry, I don't remember you, or kyle for that matter. But maybe you can help me with that. Was I here a lot with kyle? A few times a week at least. Oh, shoot. Sorry, I gotta run. It was really great to see you. Yeah. bye. grace, you ready? Grace! bye, grace. Coming! Just kidding. - 'thank you.' - 'of course.' - 'I needed a getaway.' - 'it's gonna be great.' - I love it up here. - Yeah. So peaceful and quiet. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Are you okay? I'm so sorry. I was changing the song in my phone and I totally didn't see you, I.. It's fine. Oh, my god, I can't believe we ran into each other again. - Literally. - Literally. I, I don't think we've met. I'm-- paul patterson, I am a huge fan. I was just trying to get my husband to read your book 'to help us fix our marriage' but he thought leaving me for another woman was a better solution. I'm so sorry to hear that. And for what it's worth, it sounds like you're better off. Yeah, well, you know what they say about karma "you get served what you deserve." my friends brought me up here on a girl's weekend to clear my head. It sounds like you have good friends. How do you know my wife, grace? Your wife? Well, I, uh.. Oh, I had one of my dizzy spells and dropped my keys and she came to help. Oh, a good samaritan. Oh, uh. Oh, I gotta take this. It's brad. No, that's fine. Take your time. 'yeah. Okay.' I'm so sorry to put you on the spot I can assure that what you saw in the parking lot wasn't-- you don't owe me any explanation. I'm not the one you're married to. But as someone who was just recently cheated on herself can I offer you some advice? Stop lying. The truth always comes out. - It just does. - No.. - I can tell you the t-- - hey, sorry about that. It was very nice to meet you, paul. Oh, it was nice meeting you. See you. - Well, you okay? - Yeah. I'm fine. - Um, let's go to dinner. - Let's go. ugh, now it's india. I'll just let it go to voicemail. Oh, no, take it. It takes me longer to get ready anyways. Just give me the keycard and I'll meet you up there. - Okay. - Okay. - See you. - Alright, bye. Okay. after you. What? What are you doing here? I'll see you later. What? 'hello!' no. grace! Hello! 'grace! Hey, grace!' grace! 'what is going on, grace? Let me in.' 'you said your home in la was broken into recently as well?' 'two weeks ago. Do you think they are connected?' 'think it's too much of a coincidence for not to be.' this feels personal. Anybody you know who might have an axe to grind with you? Someone you might have wronged? No. What about you, ma'am? Um, I-- I can assure you, she has no enemies. She's not the type of person to make anyone feel wronged. Wait. You're the relationship guru, am I right? I've seen you on tv. Any chance this could be a jealous ex of one of your patients? 'I never thought about that.' I, I guess so. When you go back to la, I suggest you make a list of names of anybody who could've done this. Give it to the cops and have them look into it. Yup. Here. Feel free to send it to me as well. - Thank you. - Of course. Thank you. let's go home. Thanks. Should I call taylor and have her come home? No, let her have fun with lisa. There's no reason to have everyone's weekend ruined. Right. Paul, I need to talk to you about something. Um, let's eat something first. Yeah, I'm hungry. Um, let me get dinner started. 'actually you know what, I'm gonna make a drink.' 'do you want anything in particular?' uh, give me some scotch. okay. Is this what you wanted to talk to me about? I can explain. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Will you say something? What do you want me to say? You're angry. You feel betrayed. - You don't understand. - Yes. To all those. - I don't remember him. - Yeah. Your memory loss is real convenient right now. I don't remember him, paul. - It's like this never happened. - But it did happen. Apparently it's still happening. It looks like here, okay. Look, he was holding my hand really hard in this and in this he was, he was putting my necklace back on. How does he have the necklace that I gave you? How? How does he have the necklace that I gave you? He said that the hospital called him. Why didn't they call me? Why didn't they call me? I don't know. You have to believe me. Okay, please just let me explain it.. Don't touch. How can I believe you? Apparently you've been lying to me for over a year. No, no, I'm telling you the truth. Well, a picture's worth a thousand words. oh, my god. Dad? What are you guys doing home? There was an issue with the hotel and we had to come home early. - How was the concert? - Oh, my god, it was so.. oh, we had the best time, mom. 'I was just gonna make dad and I some dinner. Are you hungry?' - I'm starving. - I'm actually starving. - Yes. - I would love some food. - Let's go. - Let's go. so, does this mean you guys are getting a divorce? - No. - I don't know. Uh, hey, taylor, let's go upstairs and give them some time to talk. 'come on.' I think right now we should focus on keeping our family safe. Clearly, this guy is unstable. You don't really mean what you said about getting a divorce, right? Paul, I don't know what it is but there's-there's there's something about this that just it doesn't feel right. Cheating never feels right, grace. I would never do this. What's his last name so I can tell the detective? 'what is his last name?' I don't know. Okay, what about the text messages? They can trace him through that. We didn't send text messages. We, um, apparently communicated on a private app. Wow. oh, god. It's like I don't even know who you are anymore. - Paul. - No. I just don't get it. Why would I do this? What the hell was I thinking? God, I even roped lisa into lying for me. I am a terrible person. - No, you're not. - I am, mom. You're not a terrible person, you're a good person who made a bad decision. Everyone makes mistakes. This was a pretty big one, mom. You said there were photos of the two of you together? Can I see what he looks like? Yeah. Sure. Oh, he looks familiar. I-I can't pin point it but I feel like I've definitely seen him. Well, lisa said that he visited me at the hospital. Did you see him there? There were so many people that came to see you at the hospital, honey. I-I certainly couldn't keep track of them all but maybe...But I definitely recognize him. Great. Confirmation that I really am an adulterer. no! Let me, let me out! Oh, my gosh. What are you doing in here? - What are you doing in here? - I'm sorry. I thought you were at home. I'm sorry I freaked out, I got claustrophobic and everything's so weird right now. oh. 'what is it?' 'grace, is everything okay?' it's taylor. She wants me to pick her up. - You okay? - Oh, go pick up taylor. - I will handle everything here. - Are you sure? Yes. Go. You're the best. Alright. See you later. come on, taylor. taylor. Hello! Hello! Taylor! taylor, are you in here? - No. - Leaving so soon, grace. Remember me? Kyle's wife. I tried to warn you about karma. Remember? You know, I never actually believed in karma myself until I found out about your little accident. I prayed every night that you would never wake up. That you'd get exactly what you deserved. But then you did wake up. So, I decided to take karma into my own hands. No! Look, stacy, I'm not in love with your husband. I swear to you. I don't remember him. Yeah? I'm gonna go. I don't believe cheaters. You seem to forget that I ran into you 'after I took those photos.' the ones I sent to your husband. You certainly seem to remembered him then. Do you know how tempting it was 'to tell your husband the truth right there?' but you lied so effortlessly. I wasn't sure he'd believe me. Besides I'd already left him that message in your hotel suite. You ruined my life so I get to ruin yours. No! No! What's that saying, grace? Huh? What's that saying? If I can't have him, no one can. No! No! get in here! stacy, stop. I don't remember.. stacy. Stacy! hey. What the hell happened? - Where's paul? - Um, he's not coming. The media got tipped off and they've been calling him non-stop. 'there's cameras outside your house and here.' miss patterson? A minute, please. Uh, wait here. All I want is for stacy to be behind bars. - Who? - Stacy. - The woman who attacked me. - Her name's not stacy. It's tina. Tina lewis. And she's not being arrested, I'm afraid. What are you talking about? What's going on over here? Is everything okay? Ms. Lewis claims that you assaulted her after you broke into her home. You can't possibly believe her? Well, you did come to her house. 'yeah, but I didn't know this was her house.' I told you that my daughter sent me a text from her friend's phone asking me to pick her up here but obviously it was just a set up from stacy that tried to trick me into coming here. - May I see those texts? - 'oh.' just one second. No. No. No. - Is there something wrong? - They're not here. I must have accidentally deleted them during the altercation but I got a text. I was there, I witnessed it. And you personally witnessed what was written in that text? Well, no, but, um, I-I asked her and she told me that taylor needed a ride home. So, all you know is what she told you? You have no idea if that's what the text said? What are you implying that my sister was lying to me? I'm not trying to imply anything. I'm just trying to find provable facts. Let me ask you this, mrs. Patterson. How did you get into ms. Lewis's home? She claims you broke in. Okay, this is ridiculous. My sister did not break in to anyone's house. Grace? I first knocked, and the music was loud. And the door was unlocked, so I just entered. 'you broke into someone's house.' 'the door was open.' I'm telling you, this stacy-tina she's setting me up. Why else would she have lied about her name? Well, according to her, you knew exactly who she was which is why you came to her home. No, she orchestrated this whole thing to get back at me for having an affair with her husband. An affair I don't even remember having. You have to believe me. I wish I could, mrs. Patterson 'but you need to understand, I'm dealing' with a lot of she said she said here. And the only real evidence is not looking very good for you. I'll be in touch. Is that taylor that really texted you? How can you even ask me that? I, you gotta see it from my perspective, grace. I mean, first, I catch you kissing kyle which is somebody supposedly you don't remember and then kyle's wife texts you that she wanted to meet you alone to attack you but she's the one leaving in an ambulance. - Okay. - And in the text message. Okay, so what are you saying? That I've been lying this whole time? That I'm still seeing kyle and I, I don't know I came over here intentionally to hurt his wife to take her out of the picture? You can't actually think I'm capable of that? I don't know, grace. I didn't think you were capable of having an affair but here we are. Lisa, I'm your sister. Come on. I just need to wrap my head around this. mrs. Patterson, do you have an affair? Who is he? 'what's his name?' how long have you two been together? No comment. Please just leave me alone. I-I have no comment. I have no comment. 'how is this affecting your kids?' how is this affecting your business? Mrs. Patterson. 'paul patterson's wife, grace' 'showed up at this home behind me' 'and got into a physical altercation' with a woman who is the wife of her alleged lover. It all comes down to honesty and trust. Communication is the foundation of our partnership. I'd say there's trouble in paradise. 'we'll bring you more details as they become available.' 'back to you, wendy.' I honestly never thought I would say this but I-I don't think our marriage can survive. You've completely destroyed any trust that I had. 'what if this woman decides to press charges?' she attacked me. You broke into her home, grace! Which means, legally, she can claim self defense. 'as if you cheating on me wasn't bad enough' you're putting my livelihood and my reputation at risk. I've booked an airbnb for taylor and I for a couple days. If you need some space, that's fine 'but don't take taylor away from me.' if you're telling the truth, grace a-and that is a big if then this woman knows our daughter's name. She knows the names of our daughter's friends. Which probably means she stalking taylor. We're lucky all she did was pretend to be her this time. I'm not letting your poor choices put our daughter at risk. She's coming with me. Okay, I have kyle and tina's last name now. And I'll find something on them-- no. No! 'do not talk to the police.' 'you'll only incriminate yourself further.' from now on, I will handle everything. I think you've done enough. why can't I stay here with you? Your dad's right. It's not safe here. If anything were to ever happened to you.. Well, for what it's worth.. ...I believe you. I don't care what pictures or what anyone says, okay? I know who you are. And I love you. Okay. - Go. - I love you. - Hey. - Yup. I love you. Okay, stacy, tina, who are you? 'hey, grace.' 'grace.' grace, I saw the news. And this is great. We don't have to sneak around anymore. Grace. You can't ignore me forever, grace. I'll be back. 'open up!' 'grace!' 'grace!' 'it's pointless to hide.' 'everyone knows about us.' 'I'll just keep coming back.' - can I help you? - 'um, yes.' is this the tina lewis that works here? Yeah, but she won't be in for another hour so you'll have to come back. That won't be necessary. Maybe you can help me. Sure. What kind of tat you're looking to get? Oh, no. Um, I was hoping that you could answer some questions about tina and her husband kyle. Husband? Heh. Kyle's not her husband. He's her brother. Okay. Thank you. Bye. tina? I can't believe you'd have the nerve to show up here. I could press charges. I know that you and kyle are brother and sister. Put down the knife. I'm not here to hurt you. Okay? Please. I just can't figure out why you lied about it? It doesn't matter why. It does if you don't want me to press charges against you. 'cause the way that I see it, as soon as I take this new information to detective wallace it will confirm my version of the assault and all of his attention will go to you. What do you want? I want you to explain how I know your brother. Why do I remember him? I can't rat out my own brother. The truth is gonna come out eventually. You told me that, remember? You can either explain it to detective wallace from a jail cell, or you can just explain it to me right now. Tina, your clients are waiting. Let me go to my client. I'll meet you at the cafe on 3rd at 4:00. I'll explain everything. You can't do this, alright? You'll ruin everything! look, I'll give you more money. It's not about money anymore, kyle. Okay? It's not right. I only agreed to help you break up her marriage. 'you never said there was a kid.' and as for the other night, if she presses charges they'll revoke my probation and I'll be sent back to jail. Yeah, and what makes you think she won't press charges anyway, huh? 'I don't know but I have to try' and besides, it's, it's not up to me anymore, okay? My sense of right and wrong has kicked in. I just, I have to stop doing this. Even for money. All those times that I saved your ass as a kid 'and you're gonna go.. Tina?' tina! - See you tomorrow. - See you. forget something? Save your breath, alright? There's nothing you can say or do to change my mind. ♪ and I can be replaced ♪ ♪ before you know you're wrong ♪ ♪ I'll be gone from this place ♪ ♪ watch me go ♪ ♪ watch me fly ♪♪ - ah! - 'oh!' - 'taylor.' - mom! What are you doing here? Does your dad know that you're here? 'no. Thad dropped me off.' 'I just wanted to see how you were?' sweetie, oh, you scared me. - You scared me. Oh, my god. - Hey. - Come here. Good to see you. - Hi. It's good to see you. How are you? I'm okay. - Yeah? Are you sure? - Yeah. You scared me. no. hello, detective. Can I help you? Cleaning house? More like falling apart. Actually I was gonna call you about tina lewis. She's the reason I'm here actually. 'I heard you paid her a visit today.' yeah, I did. Um.. I can't believe tina called you. She didn't call, mrs. Patterson. She was found unconscious and bleeding. If there's anything I should know, now's the time. No, no, I only went to her work to talk to a co-worker and they told me that kyle is her brother. Her brother? Why would she lie about that? Exactly. I went there to wait in the parking lot for her to get to the bottom of it and she agreed to meet me at the cafe on 3rd when she finished her shift, but she never showed. She must have told kyle about telling me the truth. I'm assuming a waiter or someone at the cafe will be able to confirm that you were actually there during the time of the assault? Yes, there was a bartender there. Okay, I'll check it out. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Uh, detective? I didn't do it. - oh, my.. Oh. - No. - hey, mom. - Hey, honey, uh, where are you? 'just hanging out at thad's, why?' do you have that, uh, that video of grandma's 70th birthday party? The one that we watched during our girl's night? - Yeah. Sure. - 'yeah.' 'can you send that over to me right now?' do you have any other videos of that night? No, just that one. Mom, are you okay? - What's going on? - Too much to explain. Um, just send it over right now, okay? Okay. Bye. Thank you. happy birthday, grandma. happy birthday. I-I can't pin point it, but I feel like I've definitely seen him. How long have two been.. - With your sister? - Yeah. uh, just a couple of months. - 'you guys.' - 'mom.' gotcha. what are you doing here? Seriously, you need help. I finally figured out why I don't remember my affair with kyle and it's not because of the accident. Grace, stop. I-I don't wanna do this. Not tonight. It was always just a tiny little memory just a flash of us being together. I don't wanna hear that. No, we were just talking but, you know, I could never place where we were until tonight. What are you talking about? I'm talking about this. Taylor took a video at my mom's birthday party and in the background, you can see lisa kissing kyle. I must've talked to kyle at some point in the party. But I wasn't there with him, lisa was. Look. That could be any of your sister's boyfriends. - You can't even see his face. - But look at this. Th-the tattoo peeking out from his shirt? That matches the tattoo on the shirtless selfie that he sent me on the app. 'the app that was purchased' when I was in a coma. Look, it's right there. Lisa must've sent these messages and manipulated the time stamps. Paul, this picture of kyle and I, this is lisa. She photoshopped my head. You can see on her left foot, that scar. That's lisa's scar. She got it when we were kids. Okay, lisa dropped everything to be there when you were in your coma. Exactly. So she could step right into my life. She's always been jealous of me and she's always had a crush on you. that's absurd. As long as I was in a coma, she could live my life and have everything she ever wanted. The problem was that I woke up. - This is crazy. - No, paul, it's not crazy. She had access to everything, to my photos to my phone, to my credit cards. She even managed to convince me that I confided in her about the affair with kyle. I just don't understand how she convinced kyle and his sister. Wait, wait. His sister? Yeah, tina is his sister. We're gonna be okay. No, lisa, no. what's wrong with you? 'lisa?' 'what the hell is she doing here?' she wasn't even supposed to be here. 'she figured it out.' how did she figure everything out? - Did you tell her? - 'whole thing's falling apart.' 'kyle's an idiot. Your friend's are idiots.' 'they don't wanna cover it..' yeah, that's why I did what I did to get her away from you. - 'I don't understand why you--' - I did this for us. I did what I did because I love you. God! I told you that she was in love with you. You, what are you trying to do? You trying to steal my life now? - No. - Hm? Look, I, I really wanted to help you but I didn't intentionally mean to fall in love with paul. We just found comfort in each other. Oh. If you actually think that these feelings are mutual you are more delusional than I thought. I'm calling the cops. Alright. where's my phone? - Paul, hand me my phone. - Hey, just.. - Just wait. Relax. - Paul, hand me my phone. You're in on this too? I'm sorry. It-it, it just happened. What? The night of the accident.. ...I found your letter. You told her she was the love of your life. I knew. I was on my way to confront you. My god. It started eight months ago when your business picked up. You weren't around. One night we kissed, we didn't stop. So you actually wanted to make me out to be the cheater? I had to. Okay? There's no way I could leave you after the accident. It would ruin my career. Okay? So I had to make it look like you betrayed the relationship. It's good of you, paul. It's really good of you. So what, you had me attacked? Tina wasn't gonna seriously hurt you. She was just supposed to cause a scene so I could...Tip off the press. Of course. Was that even kyle's house that you sent me to? And the neighbor? Just a friend who owed me a favor. - I'm out of here. - Hey, hey, hey. - Let's just talk. - No way. - Too late. - Hey, grace, just listen! - Let go of me. - Okay? - Oh! - God! You wanted to get the press involved? Oh, let's get the press involved. They'll have a field day with the relationship guru to the stars cheating on his wife. Oh, that'll do wonders for your book sales. I can't let you do that. Where did you get that? Tina's car when I paid her a visit. Forget something? That was you. I had to keep her quiet. I was planning on using this so I could frame you for her attack 'seeing how the first time didn't stick.' do you honestly think that those text just magically disappeared? Lisa, just stop it. Just stop. - 'no, just, eh..' - lisa. You had everything when we were kids. You were always so perfect. You couldn't accept the fact that you had an affair. You just had to keep pushing and pushing until you ruined everything! Poor grace, she couldn't remember that she had an adulterous affair with her lover kyle 'and when things didn't go as planned' out of jealous rage, she comes up.. Lisa, come on. ...With his sister's gun. Hey, hey, hey, hey. No, no, no. We can't do this. hey! Hey, you gotta help me! - Freeze! - What? No, no, no. My sister's trying to kill me. - She killed tina. - Cuff her. What? No. Ms. Patterson. It's okay, put it down. - 'no, no, no.' - it's okay. I'm innocent. I'm not the one who killed tina, she did it. Save it. When kyle found out what happened to his sister he came clean about everything. Get her out of here. Stand down, officer. No. No. No. I'm sorry I didn't believe you. At least you do now. Did kyle say why they did this? Your husband paid them $100,000.
