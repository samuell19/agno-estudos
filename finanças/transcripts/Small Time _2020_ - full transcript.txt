Waiting for Jessie to get up. It's, like, almost 12:00. Maybe you should just go get her up. I already tried, three times. She won't get up. I don't think she wants to. She's gonna be mad. God damn it! Jessie, don't, fucking... do this to me! Do not do this! It's okay. Breathe, god damn it. Come on. Come on. - What did she take? I don't know. I don't live here.

It's just like mine was when I was little. Were you sick? I'm feeling much better now. What's that? A hammock. Go try it out if you want. Okay. What took you so long? Miko's dicking me around. I was playing cat and mouse for a half an hour. - What, again? - Yeah, he's falling apart. I got it all, though. I got a bunch of deliveries waiting on me. Hi, Emma. What you doing? I'm swinging. Wow. You really are becoming a woman, aren't you? Jesus. It's like time on speed. - Better? - Hmm... My baby's gotten so big. I should have woken her up earlier, right? Hey. It's not your fault. She fucked up. Is she gonna die? Nah. Morning. Coffee? I'm gonna go into the hospital today, see your mom. Maybe she woke up. She's sleeping? Yeah, they, um... a deep sleep. Deep sleep. Like, dead sleep? No. Deep sleep like... coma... sleep. What's coma sleep? It's sleep. Just for a while. I'll bring you news. Are you Rick's girlfriend now? Yep. Rick's my man. Do you know my mom? I know her. She was Rick's girlfriend before. I know. She's in the hospital. I know. Rick said she's not gonna die. - I think it's stuck. - It ain't stuck. Pull back, not down. Yank that baby back. Holy cow. Let's go! - Is it cocked? - Yeah, it's cocked. - Are you sure? - Hey, careful with that. That's ready to shoot. Straighten your arms. Grip it tight. Ready, aim... fire. Holy fuck!

Shoot it. Hey, hey! What are you doing? You're blind. Come on! Get off of me. Okay, hold it over the flame. Hold the spoon? Yep, the spoon over the flame. Closer. You said we were gonna cook. We're cooking, babe! I want to cook cookies. We're gonna do that after. We just gotta finish this first. - The spoon's getting hot. - Don't drop it. Look, we're almost there. See how it's starting to bubble around the edges? It looks like maple syrup. Mm-hmm! It's my special syrup. Mm... Good girl. Nice job. Mmm... Okay... What's an "oz"? Hmm... I don't know. Like the wizard? An "oz" of butter. Oh. I'm not sure. Just put in the stick. A stick like one of these whole ones? Just put that whole thing in there. Oh, I have to melt it. How do I turn this on? I need to melt an oz of butter. You said you'd help me! One. Two. Three. Don't think too hard, now. Did you see smoke coming out of my ears? You're gonna hurt yourself. All right, I'm taking the Middle East from Afghanistan, so who's got it? I got the Middle East. You're going. You're going down. You fucking terrorist. Just grab the dice. Who you calling a fucking terrorist, you ISIS slob? You're history, Rick. Whatever. Play the game. Ahh! Take two. Back in your hole, Akbar. Hey, calm down, man. Fuck ISIS. That's not even where Afghanistan is. This map is grossly inaccurate. And you would know. Yeah, that is right. I would know. I'd never put my guys there. You couldn't pay me to put my guys there. Hey, okay, I've got all of the United States. Who wants to wrestle me for it? - I'll take you on. - You're on. - All right. - Wrestle? You're disturbing him in his... No, stop it, don't fight.

I thought dinosaurs were instinct. You thought wrong. Is it scaly? Touch it. It's smooth. Mm-hmm. You like it? - Is it yours? - Sure is. Hey... I'm gonna go on a ride now... if you want to come along. Where's Jessie? She's taking a nap. So, you coming? Okay. You all right back there? Yep. Hold on tight.

Did you tuck her in? Yeah, I did it. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. You sure you don't want some? No, I can't eat bacon. Why? I'm Muslim. Why can't you eat bacon if you're Muslim? I just can't. Hmm. Catholics are allowed to eat everything. I don't think I could be Muslim. You're a Catholic? Yeah, well, my family is, so I think I am, too. We even eat the body of Christ. Isn't that cannibalism? I don't know. But his blood is really gross. Hey! Emma. I thought that was you. What are you doing here? Nothing. How's it going now? Okay. Hey, uh... you want to maybe... help me run a little errand? - What is it? - It's super easy, you'll see. There's a hot fudge sundae in it for you. Okay. Get in. Wait here. Hi. Come here. Can you get that? You're really pretty. Thanks. Don't move. Look at me. Don't blink. I never got to wear makeup until I was 15. Oh... oh, my God. All right, we ready to go? Holy shit. Come on, let's go. Bye. You gonna eat that cherry? The cherry's for last. Mmm. How old are you? None of your beeswax. I'm just saying. I'm interested. Interested in what? So, uh... I'm sorry about your mom. Thanks for the sundae. Sure. Looks like you guys got everything under control here, so, uh, I'm gonna go. You gonna be all right? Uh-huh. I'm glad you're back.

Two. Two. Sweet dreams. She knows the way. She does it every day. You gotta walk her. I got nothing to say. Then just walk! Now get out. What's the point? I'm taking you to school. Okay. Why didn't you want to be my dad? I do want to be your dad. I'm here, we're walking. I know, but, I mean... why didn't you want to be my dad when I was born? I was going to war. Who were you in war with? Terrorists. Didn't you want to know me a little bit, though? From the war? It's different there. It's empty, it's a desert. It's just... Just sand and heat. You forget about everything else. Well, when did you get back? I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. You're so lucky. I want one so bad. The tooth fairy gave it to me. Seriously? The Tooth Fairy only gave me five bucks and you got a phone. I got earrings last time. They were pretty nice, but I'd still rather have a phone. What does the fairy do with the teeth? I mean, maybe the fairy has hundreds and thousands and millions of teeth just lying around. Where does she put them? I'm just saying. What does the fairy do with all the teeth? Her mom's a retard and her dad's crazy. That's why she's a perv. Oh, my God. Oh! Hey. What's wrong? - Just don't... don't look back. - Mrs. Pinkins! Mrs. Pinkins! Mrs. Pinkins! Mrs. Pinkins! "The Goldberg "is the strangest eel in the sea. "It lives in the cold, dark ocean depths. "It gulps down anything that swims in its way. "Eels are long, slim, snake-like fish. The eels in tropical waters have spots and..." I think they're coming. I'm so sorry, Cathy. She'll get a good talking-to. You can be sure about that. Say you're sorry. Say you're sorry. I am so sorry. I... I have to go pee. It's not that hard to say. Just say the words. "Sorry." But I'm not. Sometimes you just say it anyway, and take the high road. When Jesus was slapped across the face, what did he do? Did he slap back? No, he did not slap back. He turned the other cheek for more, because Jesus... Jesus is love. Well, if Jesus is love, then why did he want to be slapped? Because he's strong in his love. - - And he can absorb the punishment. He takes it on himself to relieve others of their hate. Wait, so instead of punching Haley, I should... let her punch me? No. You're not a very smart one, are you? Jesus died for your sins. You know that, don't you? Um, yeah? Well, all right, then. And your mama did not abort you. She kept you going. What does "abort" mean? That's when you're murdered before you're even born into this world. Where is my mom? Well, she, uh... she got herself screwed up because she was weak. And, uh... she did not follow the ways of God. - - Does Lonnie follow the ways of God? Well, he's trying. He's kind of screwed up, too, but, um, he's trying. Because of terrorists? Well, maybe because of that. Or maybe because he's just not praying hard enough. You can't just pray. You gotta pray hard. Did you, uh, finish up your chores? Yep. I heard something happened at school today. So... what would you like to confess? Well, um... Haley's not a very nice person, so... I punched her. But, I'm not really entirely totally sure that it's a sin. 'Cause she's a jerk face. Do you want to get into heaven? Yes. Then you need to truly repent. Okay, but, she deserved it, and that's the real truth. Also, Sadie said that Jesus turned the other cheek, and Haley didn't turn the other cheek, but she did get punched once, so she is absorbing the hate like Jesus did. So maybe that was helpful for her, actually. To be like Jesus? We're talking about your soul here, not Haley's. The way to get into heaven after is to repent now. You don't want to be standing at the gates of hell wishing you had just said your penance, do you? No. Well... then... you owe God 40 Hail Marys. ...blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners... Hey, I lost a tooth today. Oh, you're growing up. No doubt about it. Should we celebrate with the Tooth Fairy? How about we celebrate with my special grilled cheese? Take this to the boys. Dinner's ready. Look, I lost a tooth today. Wow. Radical. Move! You're blocking the target. - Comin' around that tree. - Yeah, I see. Twitch him. Turn that thing off. We're praying. Turn that off. And wait until the "amen." Dear Lord... help us to ward off the devil, for he is real. And show us your face, Lord... for we will not forget it once we have seen it. - Amen. - Amen. Not too bad. 83 hits. 27 kills. Dear God, please save my soul from going into hell. Help my mom find me. And... tell the fairy to come get my tooth. Amen. Here we go. Cha cha cha. How you guys doing? How you doing at home? One... Now we're gonna take the swivel side, and cross over. Five. One more time, let's do these side crosses. Back to mambo. Front, cha cha cha. Back. Front. Cross it over. Now let's cut that in half. Two mambos. Cross over. March in place. Now we're gonna change it again. Walk forward. Forward shimmy. Here we go. Looking good right there. You go back. Add your hair, your flavor. Are we doing communion? Put that all together. The world is shit. Five, from the mambo. Cha cha cha. It's better you know that now than to have to find out later. Forward. Shimmy. Going back. Now we're gonna march in place. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. I wonder how rocks are made. Maybe they're made from, like, boulders. Or, like, statues or something. Are you saying that rocks make statues? I'm saying that statues make rocks. Maybe. This is my mom's house. Uh... Boost me up. I'm going in. Where the fuck were you? I almost called the police. What? - Hi... - I didn't know what to do. What are you, brain dead? Don't you ever go there. Are you sure that you're okay, Emma? Yeah, we went to a garage sale. Look what I got. She wanted to go for a ride, I took her for a ride. You were gone for four hours. You cannot even begin to imagine the shit that has been going through my head. What is with the cat? It's a kitten. "It's a kitten." Isn't he cute? I'm naming him Ace. How could you take her without telling me? You were sleeping. She's fine. Emma, you thirsty? Yep. So's Ace. Don't worry about her. I need you to swear on your mother or God or whatever you swear on... your bike, for fuck's sake... that you didn't touch her. You are sick. You're sick in the head, you know that? I don't understand. I don't understand. I don't understand why you were gone for four hours. I just... I just... I don't understand. That's all, shit. Jessie. Jessie. Shut your fucking mouth. I'm not gonna say it again. I'm not trying to make you mad. I just want to know where my little girl was. I took her to Dennis's. I told you I had drops to do. - Dennis?! - She had a blast. Are you insane? And you bought her a kitten. No, she stole the kitten. You're starting to make me angry. I just... I don't understand. That's all. I don't... I don't understand. Stop whining. Stop whining at me! Sweet kitty, sweet kitty. Shh, shh... God damn it! And are you getting to know your dad, then? Um... Yeah. Mr. Pilsko? Have you been spending some quality time together? He tucked her in. He... he... walked her to school one day. Uh, they're getting acquainted, in God's own good rhythm. That sounds nice. Um... So, what did you talk about on the way to school? Terrorists. Uh, okay. Dear Lord... Good night. Good night. I told you not to go in there. I would have shot 'em. Fuck! Lonnie, I'm coming in. Lonnie? Come here. Aah! Lonnie, you gotta calm down now. Get 'em off of me! He's not right in the head. Like my mom? - Stay over there. - Surrender! Honey, I'm coming in. - Aw, God! - You hear me? Lord God in heaven! - Aw, fuck! - Protect us from his sickness. Surrender! - What? - Lonnie's at it again. I'm coming over. - I can go more! - Bring it over, and hurry. Where are you? Now, you run away. You run out that door and you stay away until it's all over. - I'm in my nightgown! - Get out, now! Go, far away! - And pray for us! - Now I see you. Get out of there, you fucking haji. Come on! I'm beyond despair! Aah! This is your mama talking to you. - Shit. - Hurry! He'll do it finally. Have you got something? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got something. Lon! Lon, man. - Get the fuck out! - Hey, it's me. Man, I'm here, I got your H. I'll finish you! Lon? Lon, friend, not foe. Here's Rick, coming in, all right? I'm coming in. Don't you fucking shoot me. Hail Mary, full of grace, The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women. Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

You're gonna have to do a lot better than that if you want to communicate with your people. You're my captive now. Don't try and resist. Look, this is lame. Untie me. Okay, mister, I'm gonna need you to settle down and listen real careful-like. What the heck? Now stop squirming, and beg for your life in bird. Don't shoot. Beg. Please? In bird. Now promise me you'll always be my friend and love me forever and ever no matter what. Okay. You're not a traitor, are you? Okay, well, break's over. Gotta go. Wait... Wait, Emma. Wait, where are you going? Emma! Let's go, let's go! No wet noodles. Keep it up. Untie me. - Ask in... - Untie me! All right, calm down. It was just a joke! Lonnie, why don't you say the prayer tonight? ...a full tank of chemicals into your toilet bowl. But the Little Blue Elephant stays around to clean 24/7. Even streaks are no match for the powerful Little Blue Elephant. Jesus... you heal the sinner of their sins. Here's how it works. Six ounces of fresh water passes through the Little Blue Elephant and brings the cleaning chemistry down the refill valve into the toilet bowl. If I had you in front of me right now I'd ask you why there's so much dark shit all around. Language. ...and no tools are required. It really works. I love the Little Blue Elephant. Drop-in toilet tablets only last for a week or two and they can damage the internal parts of... Sometimes... Sometimes life feels... I like life. Amen. Amen. Does God ever go on vacation? Sometimes... it feels like God's on vacation but he's always here. He watches everything we do. Is God... fictional? Why would you say that? God is as real as you or me or any of us. Are fairies real? Fairies don't exist. Maybe you're getting them confused with angels, - who come down from heaven... - Ghosts are real. I'll tell you what's real. Demons are real. And that's why we need Jesus. Because it's a war... and we gotta win it. An incredible value, so order now. Good night. Good night... Daddy. Tomorrow will be better. That's what they say. Okay. So, uh... you like life, huh? Yeah. Why? I don't know. Okay. Good night.
