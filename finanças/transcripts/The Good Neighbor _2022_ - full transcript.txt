- David Stevens? - Yeah. You from Riga? It's my first time. Love the, uh, the architecture. It's so beautiful here. - Good to see you, you old rattlesnake. - Ohh! - David, how you doing? - Grant! -Good. How was your flight, man? - Oh, it was good. - Good! So the, uh, painters are behind on your apartment, but they assure me they'll be out in a few weeks, and then we can get you closer to town. -No, it's... it's fine. Really, Grant. -But it still needs a lot of work, the exterior. -I think it's... I think it's beautiful, really. I like it. - Good. Well, the office is walkable from the train, and there's a train station very close by. Or else you could use my other car, which is in the, uh, garage, if you need to. You'll get the lay of the land. -You know, I just want to say thank you for setting this up, Grant, really. It's... I'm excited for some change, you know? -Well, don't be too excited. I need you to serve as a swing writer. I know it's a step down for you now, but, uh, we'll get you into the system, and we'll go from there. - Okay. That's... Yeah, that's no problem. I'm here to work. You know me. Alright. Excuse me. Sorry, I'm lost. Hi. I'm David. - David Stevens. - Uh... -Your desk is over there. -Thank you. - Hi. - Hi. Hey, how you doing, man? - Good. -Yeah? Alright. -So, you met Iris? Hmm? - Yeah, I did. - She's amazing. I mean, if you're looking. Noted. Oh. Come on. Hi. I'm sorry to bother you. Um... -Hello. I'm Robert. -Oh, you're British. -Yeah, my mom was. I went to school there. - Okay. - And you're a hamster. -Is that what I said? - Yeah. How can I help you, David? -Uh, I can't seem to get my car started. I was wondering if you had a gas can that I could borrow. -Oh, I think I can do a little bit better than that... Give you some actual gas. Come in. - Oh. That's amazing. Thank you. -Excuse the mess. Do you want a beer or something? - Oh, no. Maybe another time. I just really want to get the car sorted. -Right. -Here you go. -Alright. Thank you. Did you catch that? - Yes, I did. - Huh. - You fish? - Oh, no. As a kid, uh, I wasn't very good at it. Okay, uh, thank you... - Welcome. - for this. Look, I will return this full tomorrow, I promise. -No problem. I know where you live. Right? Come on, you piece of shit. Alright. What the fuck? David, do you need a hand? Hey. Um... Yeah. - The fuse box is good. - Mm-hmm. Are you a mechanic? - Me? - Yeah. -I'm a nurse. I work for a mobile nursing unit. -Wow, that sounds rewarding -It's an odd job, really. A lot of people come to Riga to die. It's nice like that. What about you? - I'm a journalist, yeah. - Oh, really? - Mm-hmm. -Have you written anything I've read? -No, probably not. Just mostly U.S. news. - Okay. Try it now. Take it for a ride, let the gas go through. - Yeah. Hey, uh, I'm not really good with cars. You want to go for a spin in case this bad boy breaks down? - Alright. Car sounds good. -Mm-hmm. -So did you come here alone? -Yeah, just me. -No wife, no girlfriend, nothing? -Nah. No, we're done, you know? It's kind of the reason why I'm here. - I'm sorry. Fuck. - No, that's alright. Yeah, she... She dumped me because I wasn't ready to get married, and then she ran off with my best friend. -I don't think he was your best friend. Yeah, I guess not. -You know, from suffering comes happiness. You have to believe you'll be alright. The universe will take care of the rest. -Mm. -Or something. I mean, what the fuck do I know? No, I like that, I like that. Hey, that's good. You know, you're a good guy, man. - Come in. - Hey. - Hey! - So I'm going to head out. Uh, I sent you that money laundering piece. -Great. Great. I-I'll have a look. -Okay, cool. Hey, uh, if you're up for it later, drinks, my treat. -Oh, shit. I'm sorry, I would love to, but I got this, uh, phone interview from Boston. It's probably going to go late. - Okay. Sure. It's no problem. - Take a rain check. - Yeah. See you tomorrow. - Pieces of leaves with their jaws. The are transported back to the nest, where they are processed into a nutritional substrate for their subterranean fungus gardens. It's this symbiosis between the ants and the fungus that appears to be rewriting the insect evolution. But we still don't... - David. - Hey. - Hey. - What are you up to? - Watching TV. - Yeah? You wanna go grab a drink? - Now? -Yeah, I owe you a drink for helping me with the car, so... -Alright. I'll throw something on. - Okay. -To the universe. -Yeah, the universe. Hey, listen, I've read a couple of your articles. You write well. - Thank you. Thank you for reading. - Yeah. Doesn't make you feel good? - No. -Cheers. -I'll have another one. Thank you. I'd like a drink. What is it? -It's called a short trip to hell. Short trip to... I like the sound of that. -Want a sip? One's good, but the second, you might regret it. -Well, I'll buy the next round, then. -This is my... third, I think. I'm David. - Janine. - Janine? I like your bracelet, Janine. -That? Just my cycling ID. - What? - It's for my bike. I cycle everywhere. It's got emergency contacts and stuff. American? -Mm-hmm. I'm just here for work. What brings you to Riga? - Soul searching. - Ah, soul. -I'm from London originally. -Um, are you with anyone? -I met some friends earlier, but they've gone. What about you? - Yeah. A friend. He's here somewhere. - Yeah, sure. You don't have to make things up. You're better than that. - I'm not. I'm not. - Convince me. Come on. You've got my number. Call me. -I'll buy you another drink... Water, anything. -Another time. I have to get up early in the morning for work. -Don't go. -Yes? -Now you got my number. - Right. Uh, yes. I'm sorry to leave you hanging. I just met the most amazing girl. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. - Did you get her number? - I did. -Good. Let's go. Do you want to go for another beer or something? -I got to work tomorrow. I wish I could. I don't think you should smoke in this car. - I'm sorry, man. - No, it's all good. Here. Alright. Mm. - Do you know how to work this? -No, that's the wrong button. Oh, shit. -Watch out! -David, we hit something. -What? -Shit. J-Janine? Janine? What the fuck? What the fuck? -Move away. -Robert? -She's not breathing. Ooh, come on. Come on. - Robert, what's wrong with her? - Come on, babe. She's dead, David. - Shit. Shit. Shit, shit. - David, I'm sorry, mate. - Oh! Shit! - David, David... David, I'm sorry, David. - Oh, God. Fuck. Oh, God. Oh, God, it can't be. She can't be dead. Why are you driving your bike down the middle of the road? Why is there no fucking bike path?! Please. Why don't you just wake up? Wake up. -David, we need to leave now. - We got to call for help. - We can't call anybody. You've been drinking. This is murder. David, we have to go. Now, David! -Oh, fuck. - David! -I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. We should have called the police. -This could have happened to anyone. - Yeah. But it didn't. It happened to me. And it happened to her. -It happened to us, David. Look... I know this girl shouldn't have been riding her bike in the dark with no light on. But if you report this, nothing's going to change for that girl. You can't undo it. But what you can do is move on. What's past is past. Don't let this ruin us. Alright? Relax. -So where are we? - Okay. -Right. Kiel? -Yes. Police have concluded the investigation into the murder of... -Okay. That, uh, leaves us with the hit-and-run yesterday. Cyclist found dead. Uh, David, that would be you. Any questions? -Great. Let's get started. Happy Friday. -Thank you. Ohh! -Hey! You speak English? -Yes. -You were at the press conference. -I'm one of the journalists. -They're saying they have no leads. I-I don't understand. -Did you know her? -She's my sister. I'm not even meant to be here yet. We... We have kayaking. -I'm sorry. I have to go back... Back to the office. -Hey! Will you write... in... in your article, will you write that we need witnesses to come forward? - You did what?! - I took care of our problem. -And what did you do with it? -Do you really want to know? It's gone... for good. -I was at the police station for the news conference. - Uh-huh. - The girl's sister was there. -Whose sister? Who do you think? Janine's sister. She wants to know what happened. -Of course she does. What do the police know? -Nothing... far as I can tell, for now. -Good. - Robert? - David? -It's not too late to turn ourselves in. -Yes, it is. Do you know how many years you'll get for a hit-and-run in Latvia? Do you want to go to prison here... as an American? I wouldn't. Goddamn it. What do we do about the car? -Wait 'til tomorrow and report it stolen. Look suspicious if you did anything else. -Shit. -That night, you and I went into town. But we didn't drive. We went to a bar. We had a few drinks. We left the bar at 12:15 and took a tram at 12:30. Remember? Got it? Good. We have to protect each other. We have to rely on each other. Come on. It's beautiful, isn't it? -Mm-hmm. -You ready? Let's get involved. Oh, st-stay calm. - What do I do? What do I do? - Let him have the hook. - Okay, okay, okay. Whoo! - Whoa! - Wow! -Bring it in, bring it in, bring it in. Come on. - You got it? -You are blessed. What are you doing? -Jamie Oliver trick. -Oh, yeah. - You want a drink? - No, I've tea, thanks. Sorry about the smell. - It's alright. - I'd have cooked it outside, but my barbecue's broken. -Do you collect these? -Excuse me. Please... don't do that. -Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't... -My mother used to leave them for me. She went away. -W-What do you mean, went away? -You got a drink? Let's eat. -Yes, Officer, that is correct, I'm not the owner of the car. Okay, so he has to be the one to report it was stolen. Okay. I will tell him. Thank you. - David, you have a visitor. -Hi. Um, I don't know if you remember me. I'm Janine Rafael's sister. -Yes. How can I help you? -I'm Vanessa. You wrote that article about my sister, about how the police have no leads. -Yes. -I wanted to speak to you. The police, they're not moving very quickly, and, uh... -You know, I-I really have a deadline to finish. -Um, okay. Uh, maybe a drink after work? -Um, my schedule is pretty packed. -Look, I think I know how to catch the killer. This is the highway from Dzintari to Riga, which is the fastest route from the club. And this is the back road where my sister died. - Right. - What if someone was deliberately avoiding the highway? -You know, most people have driving habits. A road they'll take during the day they will also take at night. -What if they'd drunk too much? -Still could have been coming from Dzintari taking the back roads. - But that's a much longer trip. - Look, all I'm saying is that there are many reasons why someone might take that road. -So you're not going to help me. -I'll do what I can. Look, let the police do their job. You know, these things take time. - Yeah. Is someone helping you through all this? -My dad died when we were younger. And my mom died a few years back. Janine was all I had. Look, please. I need answers. I don't know what else to do. -I'll see what I can do. -Sorry. Thank you. Alright. -Do you know what? The best fishing I've ever done is in Ludza. I mean, it's beautiful. It's not far from here, actually. Fish just hop out of the water. Do you know what? I think we should go together, you and I, to Ludza. I've got a mate up there who rent apartments. Not expensive or anything. - Oh, fuck! - Shit. Let me have a look at it. What are you doing? - I'm sucking out the infection. - Stop it! -I'm sorry. There's Band-Aids in the box. Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. -It's fine. -No, it's a problem. - Robert? - What? -I have killed a woman. -Yes. But you of all people should know how this world works. -What the hell does that even mean? -You worked as a journalist in New York. -And -Bad things happen to good people all the time. Get over it. - How about you take care of your own shit, and I'll take care of mine? -Okay. If I did that, you'd be in jail. -Okay, how... how do you spell... -You just need that, that... -David, you got a second? -Uh, yeah. -That's fine. I'll finish. Yeah. - So you're settling in? - Mm-hmm, yeah. Well, I met the guy who lives next door. - Oh. - Do you know anything about him? - Rob... Robert? - Mm-Hmm. -Something like that? Oh, well, neighbors told me that his mother was an airline stewardess, used to leave him alone for weeks and weeks as a kid. He's an odd bird. But... Is everything alright? - I'm... I'm... Yeah, I'm good. I'm just working. -Okay. That's good to hear. By the way, I'm, uh, thinking of taking off this weekend. I'm going to go to the Baltic Pride Festival in Vilnius. Probably, uh, need to swap cars so we can all fit. -Oh, shit. I forgot to... To tell you. I've been having trouble keeping the car running. I was going to call a mechanic, have him come out, take a look at it. Uh, just, you know, a little gift from me to you. Everything you've done, you know? -Don't worry about it. I'll get one of the boys to drive us all. No problem. - Right. Whatever's easiest. You know? - No. All good. Okay. -Alright. I'm good, by the way. - You got a new car? - Hey. Yeah, it's just a rental. - Nice. -And you got a new grill. -This is for you, actually. - For me? - Yeah. - David... -I know your old one messed up, so I wanted to apologize for the other day. -Oh, please, mate. Forget it. I mean, I will take the grill. Can't believe you remembered. - Yeah. How about we fire it up tonight for dinner? Sound good? - Yeah. - Yeah? -I'll fire it up about 8:00. - Okay. - Okay. Thanks, David. - You're welcome. - Yeah. Wow. I can't believe you bought me a present. -Hello? -Hi, Vanessa, it's David Stevenson. -Hey. -Um... Just calling to see how you were doing. -Well, good, actually. Detective Reine called. A witnesses just came forward. -Really? - David. - Robert, listen. A witness came forward. Some old lady who lives by the road called the police. -Have they been to see her yet? -No. I'm sure they will today. -Listen to me. There's no need to panic. You find out what they know. I'm sure it's nothing. -Hey. Thanks for coming so quickly. Come in. Take a seat. So witness came forward. -Detective Reine is on her way. Maybe now they'll catch the piece of shit who did this. I don't know how people sleep at night. I'm sorry. Can I get you a drink? -Yeah. Sure. -Okay. Hello? The witness... s-she had a heart attack. She didn't make it. -I'm so sorry. - David. - You will not believe this. The old lady, the witness, she had a heart attack. -Okay. That's good. You okay? - Yeah, yeah, I'm good. -What time you coming over? -Um... Hey, I'm really sorry to do this. I'm way behind at work. -Yeah, yeah, sure. Come over whenever you want. Don't sweat it. -No, I'm not going to be able to make it. I'm really sorry. -Are you sure? I've got a lot of really nice food here. Be a shame to waste it. -I'm just, uh... I got to finish this... this piece, and they pushed my deadline. So I'm stuck here all night, really. -Yeah, yeah. Sure, sure. Go, go, go, go. Do your job, mate. Yeah, no problem. - I'm really sorry. - See you later. -Bye. Hello. I'm looking for David. -David Stevens? -Yes. We were meant to have a barbecue this evening, and he called me and said he had to work late. So I thought I'd bring the dinner to him. -Oh, I'm sorry. I'm Grant. I'm, uh... I'm one of the editors here. You... You look very familiar. -I don't believe we've met. I live next door to David. - Robert! - Yes. -Yes. Well, we have met. I... I own the house. -Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't recognize you. -Yeah. Well, um, David left about a half an hour ago. He said he was going to go down to Main Street, get some sushi, and then, uh, come back, finish up. But, uh, I mean, it... It smells nice. -Why don't you enjoy it, while it's warm? -Oh, well, that's very sweet of you. -It's my pleasure, Grant. -So did you always know you wanted to be a writer? -Uh, yeah, sort of. My mother used to say she always knew when I was a kid because I'd have all these random questions, you know? Like, here's one... Why is there a "D" in "fridge"... Think about it... - Mm-hmm. And not "refrigerator" -So I didn't ask you... What do you do for a living? -Mm. Graphic designer. -Wow, very cool. -It's good because I can work from anywhere, but London is home. -So you married? -No. Almost. We were together six years, but it just didn't work out. You? -On the mend from a recent split. -Sorry to hear that. Hey, last piece is yours. -No, it's yours. I insist. -I insist. Sorry. Mm-hmm. Well, thanks for a nice evening. - Yeah. You're welcome. - I needed that. -What the fuck? -Shit. -Who would do something like this? I'm... I'm sorry. Uh... Can I give you a ride home? -It's okay. I'm only like a five-minute walk from here. Thanks. -Mm-hmm. Have a good night. - You, too. -Great. Fuck me. - Hey, Robert, it's, uh it's David again. Been trying to reach you Just give me a call when you get this. Bye. Hi. -Uh, Vanessa. Hi. -I'm sorry for i-intruding. I went to your office, and they said you were here. I wanted to give you these to say thank you for being so helpful, for listening to me. -Thank you. Uh, you really sh-shouldn't... -Please. -Okay. -Can I come in? Janine and I, we weren't really speaking. We got into this huge fight in Greece last summer. And she left to come here. Just so stupid. I just wish I'd done more to resolve things. I feel so guilty. And I miss her. I really miss her. God. I'm... I'm sorry. -No, it's okay. -Okay. Hey, I didn't know if you wanted some... -So cheerful, bright. Beautiful. Much too early to be called way. -She was the best chef, the best colleague, the kindest person at all. -May she... rest in peace and... have freedom... forever. -Janine and I had been through so much. We were always there for each other. It's amazing to see that she found her tribe in such a beautiful place. To Janine. - To Janine. - To Janine. - To Janine. -I'm so sorry, Vanessa. -Hi. Thank you for coming. -I'm sorry for your loss. -Where were you? - What? - Were you at the memorial? -Yeah, I had to cover it for work. -Why was Vanessa Rafael at your house last night? -Are you spying on me now? -Her Uber turned around in my driveway and woke me up. Have you read this? -David! The sister, David. The bloody woman is dead! And you want to go play therapy with the sister. What are you trying to be, David? Her rock? Look... All I've ever asked of you is your loyalty. I need to know I can count... -I'm not going to tell her a damn thing. Trust me. Eventually, she finds out everything. Women always do, David. Then what? -Well, that's about it, then, I guess. Um, no questions, uh, have a good weekend. - Have a nice weekend. - Thank you. Bye. -Uh, Henry, could I speak to you a second? How's David doing? -Well, actually, he missed a couple of deadlines. -A couple? -Hey. How you doing? -Yeah, you know, I'm just, uh, really swamped at work. -You haven't returned any of my calls. Are you sure you're okay? -I don't think we should do this anymore, Vanessa. -We met because of Janine. Don't you think some good can come of that, some light after all this darkness? Could be a chance for both of us. -Yeah? Grant here. -Hello. This is Officer Pavlows. I'm calling about your stolen car, a 1984 BMW. -My stolen car? -David?! - Hey, there. -So nice. -Mm-hmm. - I'll go get the kayaks. - Okay. - Thank you very much. - Take care. Have fun. -There's a really nice point to stop if you want to stop for a romantic lunch, hang out and have a drink. Yeah. - Cool. -Other than that, the lake is beautiful. - Thanks. - What are you doing here? - You know each other? - Yes. How do you know each other? - This is Vanessa. We're friends from work. Vanessa, this is my neighbor. -Oh, I'd like to think I'm a little bit more than that. I'm his friend... Robert. Pleasure to meet you. - Have we met? - Oh, I think I'd remember. -I think our kayaks are ready. -Okay. Nice to meet you. -And you, Vanessa. -What the fuck are you doing here? -Kayaking. There you are. What a beautiful day. Not too hot, not too humid. -I somehow imagined this differently. -Hey, Robert, uh, do you mind giving us a little bit of privacy? -I'll find a good spot, and I'll leave you two alone. By the way, special occasion? -My sister and I used to do this trick before she passed away. We thought we'd do it to celebrate her. -God, that's awful. I'm so sorry. What happened? -She was hit by a car. -A car? That's not the girl in the newspaper? -Robert. -They still haven't caught him, right? - Robert, please. Please. - That man's a pig. I can't believe that bastard. Leave a beautiful girl like that dying in the street like an animal. Vanessa! Vanessa! - Vanessa! -I'm sorry! I'm so sorry. -Vanessa! Robert! Son of a bitch. Motherfucker. -Aah! -Robert! Oh, my God. -David! David! Here! -I got you. I got you. Hey. -Hey. - Here you go. - Thanks. How you doing? You okay? -Thanks. I saw... I thought I saw... I thought Robert... -Robert what? -Nothing. Doesn't matter. I'm just glad it's over. How is she? Is she alright? -She... She almost drowned, Robert. What the hell is wrong with you? -I have no idea what you're talking about. -You know exactly what I'm talking about. Do you think this is some kind of game, huh? You come down here. You insult her. You embarrass me. -Insult her? Embarrass you? You killed her sister. You're doing the insulting. -You know, Robert, why don't you just leave? -Or what? - Or what? - Yeah. Or what? -I got this under control. -I know you do. Of course. I'm sorry. -Mr. Stevens? I'm Detective Reine. -Yes, I know who you are. I was at the press conference. -Ah. Oh. What a coincidence. How are you? - Good. Is there news about my sister? -No. Sorry. Actually, we are here to talk with Mr. Stevens. - Please have a seat. - Oh, thank you. -Can I get you something to drink? -No. Actually, the reason we are here is you reported your car stolen, Mr. Stevens. - Yes. Well, technically, it's not my car. - Mm. We know. Our officer tried to confirm the owner, but he hasn't returned the call. -I think he's on a getaway with some friends for the weekend, yeah. - Huh. -You reported the theft on Saturday, after the hit-and-run last week, yeah? -Yeah, on Saturday. It might have been Friday. - Small details, right? - I think it was Saturday, yes. -Let me ask you something. -Thursday night, where were you? - Thursday night? - Yeah. - Um... Teritorija bar. -Was Ms. Rafael there, as well? -No. No, we... met at your briefing. -No, I mean, Janine Rafael. -I'm sorry. Uh, what... What is this about? I don't understand. - Ms. Rafael's phone records. You called her that night at, uh... at 11:28? -That must be a mistake. I did make a call that night at the bar. There was a woman, and she wrote on my arm, and then she left. God, I'm... I didn't know that was her. -How long were you at the bar? -Uh, not very long. Quarter past twelve. I took the tram home. -Can anyone testify to that? Mr. Stevens, can anyone testify to that? Yes. Robert, my neighbor, he was with me all night. -Okay. So we'll have a little chat with him. -You knew my sister. -I guess I did, but it was brief. I didn't even realize. -Well, you knew her well enough to call her. -Why didn't you tell me? -Because I didn't realize until just now. -And the car missing? That doesn't seem odd to you? -That was stolen from work. You knew that. -Well, it's a fucking coincidence. -What do you want me to say? -I want you to tell me the truth. -Did you know my sister? I... I knew her. But I didn't realize I did. What does that change? -Everything. -What did you tell them? -The truth. We took a tram at midnight. -Took a tram at midnight. -Okay? Come in. This has to stop. -What has to stop? -You at the wheel. You think you're the only one with something to lose here? -They don't have anything on us, right? They don't have a car. They don't have a witness. -No. Sleeping with the dead girl's sister puts us at risk. You have to deal with it... now. -What could you possibly have to say to me? -I... -What, you're going to make something up? I don't think so. -Ludza are the best fishing grounds in the world. Throughout the year, from March to October, fish can be found in more than 50 lakes. -It's over. Are you satisfied? -She'll turn on you. She'll ruin your life. You can't trust anyone, David. - Hi. - Hi. - Vodka martini, please. - Up, rocks? -Rocks. Did you know her? -Janine? Sure. She came here a lot. -And the night she died, did you see her? -I saw her. She looked happy. So sad to hear the news. -Thanks. -I'm sorry. I-I don't speak Latvian. -You need to catch the shuttle bus heading north. Tram stop running in the night. Construction. -For how long? -All night, from Thursday until Monday. No trains after 10:00 p.m. -Since when? -Over a month now it's been like this. -You must be from out of town. -Yes. Thank you. -Vanessa? Hi. -I need to speak with David. -I'm sorry. He's not here. He's got a deadline. -Right. Another deadline. -Can I help you? -No, thank you. -Okay. -The night my sister was killed, you and David, you left the bar together. -Yes. -By tram. -We knew we were going to drink, so we took the tram. -And you left when? -Why are you asking me these questions? -Answer me. What time did you leave? -Around midnight. -The tram doesn't run past 10:00. -What? -They've been out of service for over a month. Vanessa... I know you're desperate to know what happened to your sister. There's no need to lie. -You lied to the police. You were in that car, and you hit her. You left her there to die! -Did I? Did I?! -Robert. -David! -How the hell did you get in here? - It was open. - What are you talking about? It was locked. - I'm sorry, it was open. Who cares? Come on in. Sit down. You alright? -Mm-hmm. So what are you doing here? -Right. I know things haven't been easy for us, with the accident and everything, so I thought I'd get you a present. That is two weeks fly-fishing in Ludza. Train tickets. Leaves tomorrow night. What do you say? Robert, what are you doing? -What? -You know I can't go. I have to work. -You could write an article. -Shut up. Just shut the fuck up. -Whoa. I thought I was doing something nice for a friend. -Friend. Oh, we're not friends. We will never be friends. Get out of my house. -David... -I'm asking you to leave. Fucking fishing trip. Get the fuck... out of my house! Hello? Vanessa, y-you there? It's David. It's really important. It's about your sister. Phew! -Hi, it's Vanessa. You know the drill. David, hi. -Ooh! -Sorry. Listen, our meeting was canceled. - Why? - Because no one can get a hold of Grant. Have you heard from him? - No. - Well, he went on that trip, but still hasn't shown up yet, so, we're going to postpone 'til noon. - Okay. - Okay? - Yeah. Hey, Grant, it's... It's David again. Just... give me a call when you get a chance, okay? Just checking in. Excuse me. Excuse me, hi. Sorry to bother you. Is it possible I could borrow your phone for a moment? Mine's run out of battery. -Sure. -You're so kind. Thank you. -Vanessa. -Hello, David. -Robert? Where's Vanessa? -She's with me. -Can you put her on the phone, please? -No, not right now. -Robert, listen to me. Whatever you're thinking about doing, we can talk about this, okay? Just tell me where you are. -I'm thinking of taking her fishing. -Ugh! -Damn it! -Oh, please. Please let me go. I won't tell anyone. Please, please, just let me go! Please! - Shh. -I'm going to tell you a little story. -Your sister was alive when I drove away. I convinced David that she was dead and that he was the murderer. You see... - I've never had a brother. Oh! Ah! - Ah! -Oh, my God! Vanessa. Oh, my God. Vanessa. Oh, my God. Vanessa. I'm so... so sorry. -David. -What have you done? -What have I done? What have I done? Are you thick?! I've protected you. That's what I've done. Isn't it obvious? Like I've been protecting you from the day I met you. -You killed her! -Oh, no, David. You killed her. You killed them both. And your friend Grant. Because you're too stupid to listen. You ungrateful prick. I did this for you! -Oh! No! David. This isn't you! You're a journalist. I'm the murderer. You are a good person. Don't ruin us. - Aaaah! -Freeze! Police. Put the weapon down. Hands behind your back. -Ah! You cannot be serious! He killed her! -Then we'll find some fingerprints, won't we? -Let's move. Come on, let's move. What a beautiful day. Ja. -Hmm?
