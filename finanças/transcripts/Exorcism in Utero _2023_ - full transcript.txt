- Don't touch it, put it down. - And then the chest opens up into a big mouth and tears off the guy's arms. So McGritty gets the flame thrower and lights the body on fire, but the alien is too smart, and the head falls off and legs come out and it crawls across the floor. It was so cool. - You're so lucky you got a TV in your room. - Okay, see ya. - See ya. - And then Elizabeth came up from the basement with blood all over and said something to Mr. and Mrs. Johnson. And Charlie and Elizabeth, they kneeled in front of them. And Mr. and Mrs. Johnson went back into the basement where the green light was coming from. And well, I got a little bit freaked out after that, so I went to close the blind and that's when I saw Charlie looking at me and he looked really freaked out. - Well, Charlie seems like a nice boy. Does he ever play with you and the other neighbor boys? - He's a weirdo. David tried to get him to come out and play tag once, but he couldn't 'cause he has to listen to his father read from the Bible every night. He's always so quiet. I get it now though. - Get what? - Why he's such a weirdo. His parents suck, they're devil worshipers or something. - I thought the Johnsons were Catholic? - They are, dad. Peter is just a little liar. - I'm not lying. - Do you know how exhausting it is to have to constantly call out your bullshit? But somebody's gotta hold the line. - What was that movie called again, Peter? It sounds pretty good. - No, I saw it happen at the Johnson house. - You know, honey, you can always come get into bed with me and your father if you have a scary dream. You're not too old. - It wasn't a dream. The Johnsons are freaks. - Catholics aren't freaks, honey. They're just a different denomination. They're just a bit more traditional. - Repeat after me. Movies aren't dreams, dreams aren't, reality and reality isn't movies. - It wasn't a dream or a movie! - Let's watch "Gladiator" tonight. That's a fucking movie innit? - Oh, hey, you must be Herma. - Hello. - Come on in. Hey, thanks for house sitting at such short notice. We really appreciate it. - Yeah, I actually haven't got an apartment yet, so you're doing me a favor. - Really, that's great. Charlie, did you get your retainer? This is my daughter Elizabeth. - Hi, I'm Herma. - Hello Herma, it's so nice of you to watch our house for us. - Sure thing. - And this guy, this is Charlie. Charlie, can you say hi to Herma? - Hi. - Charlie, manners. - Hi. - Herma, I'm so glad you could make it. - Mrs. Johnson, it's so nice to see you again. - You found the place all right? - Yes, thank you. I took the bus. - Perfect. - So Barbara said that you've been attending church for a while, but I've only seen you in the last couple weeks at Saturday, mass. Did you grow up Catholic? - No, one of my foster families was when I was 15. Lately, I just felt like I could use a little guidance. - Jesus is the light. - Amen to that. And regardless of the path you are on, we are just so excited to have a God-loving woman watch our house while we're on vacation. - I will do my best. - Great. - All right, let's finish packing up. - Nice to meet you. - Good luck. - Thank you. - That's not nice, buddy. All right, I will be out in a few minutes, give you a quick tour. We'll start with the kitchen. - Sure. - So here's the kitchen. We made sure we stocked all the cupboards for you. You got tons of food. Let's see, stove works, dish soap, everything's under the sink. Dishwasher also works if you want. There's extra taps under there, pretty straightforward. - Thanks. - Cool, all right. Before I show you your room, I just wanna point out, we have a cellar door here. - Oh? - Yeah, but do me a favor, don't go down there. There's a leaky pipe, and it's dripping right by our electrical panel. - Okay, no problem. Somebody will be out in a month to fix it, but if there is an emergency, we keep the key right behind you on the piano. Great, lemme show you where you're gonna stay. All right, so this is your room. Nice big bed, plenty of towels in the bathroom. It's pretty stocked, so everything you need should be right there. - Great, thanks. - I'll give you a minute and I'll see you back downstairs. What you see is what you get. Oh, we did stock the fridge. - Thank you. - So there's plenty of food in the fridge. So I will call you once a week to check in and oh yeah, there's the key and I think you're set. - Thanks. - Cool. - Oi, howdy there neighbor. How's it going? I'm just messing with you Charles. How you doing, mate? How's it going? - Those are our neighbors, the O'Neils, super nice people. - How you doing there, Charles? - Hey, how goes it neighbor? - I'll come and say hello. Just wait there, wait there. - Oh, here he comes. - Sure, I'll come over for a barbecue tomorrow. That sounds really nice. - Right, I've gotta cook something up after hearing about this lot's trip to The Bahamas. Speedos, mai tais. - Frank. - No, Frank, most of our time's gonna be spent doing missionary work, Frank. - Well, missionary work can still be down in Speedos with a mai tai in hands, right? Right, am I right, Charles? - I'll make I plan to beach day or two. - Oh, there you go, there you go, there you go. - Hey Peter. - Ah Peter, we've just been introduced to Herma, right? - That's right. - Herma's gonna be saying at the Johnsons while they're away in The Bahamas. - Hi. Now it's just you and me. Oh. Well, I can see why they didn't want me down here. Mrs. Johnson, you saucy broad. It's a bit graphic for me, Mrs. Johnson. Well, that's different. Whoa. Oh, I think I'll borrow you for the evening. Jesus, that one came on fast. Maybe I just didn't sleep so good last night. - Oops. - Fuck, no more midnight snacks. Here, let me help you with that. - Oh, what manners! Frank, can you turn that off, honey? We have company. - Oh fuck, you're here, I thought you were Ally. - No, this is, I actually don't remember your name. - I'm Herma. - This is Herma from the Johnsons. - Yeah, I remember Herma. I was there. They're always fucking off on vacation that lot. Oh, fuck off, cunt. - Ah! - Frank is from England. - Give it back you little Gremlin. - It's ringing. - That was a foul, that was a foul. - Hang it up now. Give it back now! - This is normal. This is how they show their love. - Yes, I'm calling for Ally O'Neil to confirm her appointment this afternoon for a Brazilian. - Hey, hey, hello, yeah, sorry, wrong number. There, sorted. - Are you kidding me? All phones have caller ID, dad. This isn't the '40s. He'll know it was me. - So he'll think it's a prank caller and you'll have something to talk about. - But he'll know I like him. This is a disaster. - I've never understood that. I mean, isn't that a good thing? How else do people get to talk to each other? - But you can't force logic on the heart, Frank. I'll go talk to her. - Hi. - Hi. - I'm Peter. - I remember you, Peter. Do you remember my name? - Herma, kind of a weird name. - Yeah, it is. - I like weird. Normal is boring. - I think you're right. Better to be weird than normal. - Have you seen "The Evil Dead"? - No, I don't think so. - You should, it's a great, great movie. And there's this basement where they find this evil book. And you're staying at the Johnson's, right? - Yeah. - Have you been in the basement? - No Why? - Cool, that's good. - I'm just gonna use the bathroom. - Okay. - What Peter did was wrong, but I don't think he actually did any damage. - How can you say that? He totally embarrassed me. - And that was not nice, I agree. But for once, your father is right. Look, if this boy finds out that you like him and he likes you, then he's gonna be happy, and he's gonna wanna talk to you, and spend time with you. He's probably just as nervous about it as you. - But what if he doesn't like me? Well then that's good to know, right? Then you can move on. Look, I know this is hard, but this is gonna happen a lot in your life and it will get easier, I promise. It'll still be hard, but it'll get easier because someday, you're gonna realize that you have so much to offer and you deserve to be loved. And it is not worth wasting your time on people that do not recognize your value. Plus, you're just gonna get better at recognizing when people are interested in you in that way, okay? Peter, come over here please. - What? No fair. - It's perfectly fair. - Prank call on Ally's phone is a one month penalty. You are now at 16 years, seven months, and 23 days. - That's so old, this sucks. - It's amazing how predictable you are, Peter. - You are responsible for your actions, Peter. This chart is here so that you know what the consequences will be. - Why do you keep doing this stuff? - I don't know. - Do you even know what a Brazilian is? - No. - You're a sticky little turd. - Ally. - It's a good one, I like that. - Who are you? - I'm Herma, I'm house sitting next door. - Cool, like Hannah. She was cool too. - You think I'm cool? - Yeah, why not? - Can I tell you guys something? - Of course, anything. - I'm pregnant. - Oh my goodness, how wonderful! - Congrats. - What was that? - Herma's pregnant. - With a baby? - Yes, with a baby you doofus. - Where's Mr. Herma? - Mr. Herma? - Your husband, I see you got that crazy ass wedding ring. - Oh, right, my husband is on a business trip. He goes to a ton of conferences and stuff. - Well, how far along are you? - They said about eight weeks. - Oh, that's so exciting. - All right you lot, come and get your kebabs. - What's going on, honey? - Huh? - You okay? - Yeah. - Did you finish your homework? - Almost. - Well, why don't you finish your homework? It's almost bedtime. - Okay. - And no movies until you finish your homework. - Come on! It's just some swelling. It's gonna go down. Shit! - Jesus! Fuck! - Come on, baby. I didn't mean nothing by it, I swear. I hear you shuffling about in there, baby. Why don't you open the door? I just wanna see if you're all right. - I'm fine, I don't shuffle. - Oh, oh, yes, you shuffle, baby. You're a shuffler through and through, through, through. Do you remember one thing about me, baby? I wanted to be that I revealed you to be a shuffler, not to the world, but to you, baby. I want you to know what a shuffler you are and what a shuffler you've become. Please God, please let my baby see her shuffling. - Then your son will be a shuffler. Hey, what are you going? Leave them alone! - Herma, why don't you come in? We're having bacon. - Wow, that smells amazing. I think you should know that my ex broke into your house. He's in there. - Of course he is. Why don't you come in? - Okay. - Dig in. - This is my ex's food? - He's our guest. Why do you think we're eating so late? - You invited him. - He is your husband. - No, he's not? - I sure hope I'm in a loving marriage before I get pregnant. - You fucked up. - I know, I was actually hoping to ask you a few questions. - Mm, I have to take this. - My joints feel loose. Is that normal? I really have to pee. How long is he gonna be in there? - As long as it takes. - Peter! Peter, oh my, don't eat that! What do I do? - Nothing. - Stop, hey stop. - I'm not done! - I am cleaning you up. - It doesn't even hurt that much. - Don't be silly. You were bleeding all over your food. - Are you sure it wasn't ketchup? I like ketchup on my eggs. - It was blood, and you shouldn't eat blood. - It's my blood, I can do whatever I want with it. - I'm just saying you shouldn't eat blood, yours are anyone else's. - What about cow blood from a steak? - That's fine, you can eat all the cow blood you want. - Isn't that confusing? - No, it's time to brush your teeth. Good night. - Good night. - Good night. - Please God, send me the way to her salvation. Jesus. - Are you sure it wasn't just another bad dream, Peter? - It was real mom. She came into our house and got in my bed. - You watched a scary movie again last night, Peter. - Of course he did. He watched four movies. I could hear it. - I'm not a liar! - I know, honey, but sometimes you can get things kind of mixed up. I really don't feel right accusing her of something so bizarre. She seems like such a nice young lady. - Maybe she was sleepwalking. - Or maybe you can't tell the difference between dreams and reality. - Or maybe I can't tell the difference between you and a big fat cow. - Peter! - I'm going to school. - That was a good one. I liked that. - He's getting better. I would've probably gone with hippo or manatee. Cow's pretty good. - Think she'll come again tonight? - I don't know. You wanna hang out for a little bit? - I can't, I gotta go mow my lawn. - Okay. - Okay, bye. - Bye. - Mommy! - It's Peter! What is it? What's going on? - She's back, she's in my room. - Peter are you okay? - What is it? What's going on? - Peter had another nightmare. - It wasn't a nightmare. - Ally, not now. - Where did you see her? Well, she's in there now? Oh, God. I'm sorry, I didn't see anyone in there. Were you drinking coffee? - I wanted to stay up to make sure it wasn't a dream. - Honey, that is not a good idea. You're gonna be awake all night. - Were you just drinking this with the grounds. - Who cares? You still don't believe me. - Sorry Peter, I didn't see anyone in there. - But she was just there. She was just here. - Come on honey, you can sleep with dad and I tonight. - Even you don't believe me. - I believe that you are in distress and that is what matters to me, okay? - Oh fuck. No more eating after nine, that's the rule. It's fine, you're gonna be fine. Just a couple weird dreams. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, that's not real. It's not real, it's not real. Hello. - Herma, it's Charles Johnson. - Mr. Johnson, how's The Bahamas? - Oh, it's lovely. We are having a blast. - That's wonderful. - We are blessed. Hey, how's everything at the house? - It's great, things are great. - How lovely. And you are doing well? You're finding the accommodations to your liking? - Yes, thank you. You have a lovely home, very generous. - Thank you, I'm glad all is well. Well, that's about it. I just wanted to call and check in. - Yes, all is well. - Great, we'll talk to you in a week. - Sounds good. - Bye bye. - Hi, mom. Yeah, I'm a little busy, but what can I do for you? Oh, no, well, doesn't Mr. Cole take the trash to the curb? Can you call aunt Holly? Because I'm busy. Yes, yes I am. I'm way across town, mom. Mom, and not to take the trash to the curb, no. I'm gonna call aunt Holly, okay? All right, I will call you back. 10 minutes, yes. Okay, I love you too. All right, bye bye. - Hey mom, can David sleep over on Saturday night? - I don't know, honey. You haven't been sleeping so well. Do you think you can actually sleep if David is here? - We'll be in bed by 8:30, I promise. - We'll see, I'll talk to your father. - But dad doesn't care. - We'll see. - Mom, what's wrong? - Oh, Deb, bloody hell. Peter, look at me. Peter, Peter, look at me. Hand me that towel. Keep that there. Keep the pressure on. Ally, Ally, Ally, I need you. - What is going- - Look, she's gonna be okay. Just keep it on her head. Keep her comfortable. She'll be okay. She's gonna be okay. Okay, okay, it's gonna be okay. Hi, yeah, my wife, she's epileptic. She just hit her head and she's having a seizure. Yeah, it's her first in five years, yeah. Yeah, 357 Northeast Taylor Street, yep. Okay, okay, thank you. Thank you so much. Yeah, okay, all right, okay, thank you. All right, she's gonna be okay. All right, ambulance is coming soon. This has happened before. She's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. You're gonna be all right. All right, breathe. - Come on. Hey! - What's it called? - What? - Mom's disease, what's it called? - Epilepsy, it just means she gets seizures sometimes. - That time she fell at the grocery store? - Yeah, she had a seizure. That's when I found out. - Has she had it her whole life? - Yeah, I think so. - You can sleep in your room if you want. - You okay? - I'm okay. - Okay. I'm just in the other room if you need anything, just holler even if it's the middle of the night. - Epilepsy. - Okay. God damn. That's it. Yes, I'd like to set up an appointment. I'm pregnant and I'm sick. I'm coming apart. My skin is gray and peeling, and my fingernails are coming off. I don't know, I found a ring and I put it on and it won't come off. Yes I said a ring like you put on your finger. I don't know how else to explain it. The ring is making me sick somehow. The doctor said I was only eight weeks, but now I'm huge, and that was only three weeks ago. And everything is happening too fast. Yeah, maybe it is an emergency. I have to go. I have to take my son to school. Maybe I'll stop by later. - Heavenly Father, I appeal to You with the utmost humility, but I just cannot understand this. Why won't you provide me the clarity I need? These dreams persist. That place, those faces, a woman is in danger, Father. Why can't You pledge Yourself to me as I have pledged myself to You? Please show me the way. Show me the light. Let me bring her into Your arms, into Your salvation. - In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, amen. - Ally, honey, how was your day? Did you get your chemistry test back? - It was good. No, not yet. - Huh, shouldn't you have gotten it back by now? I feel like you should have gotten it back by now. - No, it's normal. - Okay. Peter, honey, I called your teacher today and Mrs. Goodwin had so many nice things to say about you. Let's have some of that food. There you go, honey. She said you can be quite the charmer in class. Aren't you hungry? - No. - What's the problem, Peter? - Me, I don't have a problem. Mom's the broken one. - Peter! - What did you say? - You're a broken person. - Oi, watch it. - Like the van when we went camping last summer, it broke down because something was wrong with the engine and that's what epilepsy is. - Oh, do I spank him now? Is that what I do? - Dad? - No, Frank, it's okay. He has a right to be angry. - Why don't you just die already? - Oi, you leave the table now, go on. - You wanna play a game? Cool. - Hello? - Hi, Herma, how are you? - I'm not good actually. I'm pretty bad. - Is that so? When you didn't answer my call last week, I thought something might be happening. - Really, I missed a call? I mean, I've been a little, I went into the basement. - Oh, you did? - Sorry, I know you told me not to, but I went into the basement and I found this ring and I put it on. And well, I feel like I'm dying, and I'm afraid my baby is dying. - I see, wait, your baby? - I'm pregnant, something is wrong in there. Everything is sped up and I dunno, I dunno. - Interesting. - It's the ring, the ring. I feel like I can't make any of my own decisions. And I think I've been sleepwalking. And any time I try to call for help, my body won't let me. And my baby. - Oh, okay, Herma, I need you to listen to me. - I can't call for help. Can you call me an ambulance please? - Sure, but listen to me. Okay, I want you to go down to the basement. - What? - I want you to go back down to the basement and I want you to just stay there. - The basement? - Yes, go to the basement. Everything will go smoothly there. There's a nice comfy bed and everything will be much easier to clean up. - What? - Hey, Herma, I have to go. I'll see you in a couple of weeks. - Herma, honey, are you home? We haven't seen in a while, and we just wanted to make sure you were okay. We wanna invite you to a barbecue tomorrow. Oka, well, I'll try again later, honey. Don't be a stranger. - Wait, come back. Please come back. Please don't go. Why can't I just open the door? - She's actually really cool, I swear. - I don't know, Peter. I just tell my mom. She always knows what to do when I am sick. - But she's not really sick like that. It's just different. She needs a priest, I know it. - Look mom, we gotta speed this up. We already spoke to the doctor, okay? He said no cheese. I think any amount of cheese is probably gonna be too much cheese. Hey mom, can I call you back? I love you too. This is it. I found it. - Excuse me, are you a real priest? - Okay, so there might be some side effects. So just let me know if you feel anything different, headaches, mood swings, anything. - I'll tell you. - And most importantly, and Ally, I cannot stress this enough, this does not mean you shouldn't be using condoms. - Right, STDs and stuff. - Exactly. And yeah, stick up for yourself. Tell 'em what you want. - Okay, I get it, mom. - Hey, we need to be able to talk about this stuff. - I told you I'd tell you. I'll tell you. - Good honey, I'm so proud of you. - Mom! I'm going to my room. - Love you. - Love you. Peter! You little shit head! - I have something to show you. - You are the worse person I know! - Stop, I have something to show you. - Peter, give 'em back. - Stop, I have something to show you. - Give 'em back. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, wait. - Don't hurt her. - Peter, I'm sorry, help me. - Peter, what the fuck? - My son, has she done this before? She seems to have come back. - Okay, what the fuck is happening? Who is that? - It's Herma. Hide! - Peter, there's a priest in your room. - Yes, hi, my name is Father Bresson. I'm from St. Joseph's Catholic Church. I do apologize for the intrusion, but I am here to help you with the... - Whoa, what the fuck is that? Is that a woman? - Yes. - Her name is Herma. - Watch out, she's dangerous. She attacked me. - She came at you? Come here girl. - She's not dangerous. She was trying to protect me. - What is all of the commotion up here? - Peter's having a party, I guess. It's not my type of guests, but... - No, no, no, my name is Father Bresson. I'm from St. Joseph's Catholic Church. I'm here because of... - Oh my gosh, who is this? - That's Herma from the Johnson's place. They did something to her. - Be careful, mom, she came at me. - What? - He took my pills and I was trying to get them back. - Are you okay? - No! - Peter! - I came in here. Peter took my pills. - Hey, will you guys shut up? I brought you here to help her. - You didn't bring us all here, did ya? - But we need to help her. The Johnsons did something to her. They messed her up. She's possessed by a demon or something. That's why Father Bresson is gonna do an exorcism. - The church rarely grants exorcisms my son. - It's the only way. - No, we have to get Herma to a hospital. - Will you listen to me for once. I was right. You were wrong. I told you about her weeks ago when she was entering into my room, but you didn't listen just because I'm a little kid, but sometimes I'm right and you're wrong. - It's not always about being right, Peter. - It is about being right. I was right. You were wrong. And that's why, that's why I deserve a new TV. - Oh, fuck off. - Peter, now is not the time for bargaining. We really need to get Herma to a hospital. - Should we start the exorcism? I got holy water. - You have to help me. You have to help me. You have to help my baby. - We'll help you honey, we'll help you. - My child, what has happened to you? Does it have something to do with this? - I think so. I found it in the basement. - I knew it. - I thought it was just some sort of weird kinky sex dungeon and I thought the ring was cool and I was just messing around, and then I fell asleep. And when I woke up, it wouldn't come off. And things are just getting worse and worse. - All right, where is this sex dungeon? - It's in the basement, but it's not a sex dungeon. It's some weird prison for pregnant women. - I think I'll go have a look around, see if there's anything that can help us out. - I'll go with you. God knows what you'll find down there. - All right, you're it then. - Charles, you devious bastard. Missionary work, fucking knew it! - Jesus Christ, Frank! - I'm sorry. - They're imprisoning women down here. - Well, at least she gets a decent bed to sleep on, how generous. Oh, fuck me. - Yeah, I'm no expert, but I'd say they're definitely delivering babies down here. - What's this about? Are they running a franchise of burger joints or something? - Missionaries maybe, I don't think they're nice vacation spots. This must be it. - What? - Where she got the ring. - It's a bit cold in here innit? - Wait, what happened to the last person that underestimated this place? - Do you have anyone that we can call? - No one. - Well, what about your husband? - There's no husband. I lied, the father's an asshole. - Okay, any family? - No, no one, I'm an orphan. It's just me. It's just me and my baby. - Okay, well, we'll make sure to get you some help, okay? - How do you do it? How do you bear the responsibility? I mean, I don't even know what a mother looks like aside from you. - We're all just winging it. You just gotta listen to your heart. Your heart and God. And I can tell that you have a good heart. - You don't know that. You can't know that. - Maybe not, but it's what I believe. - Even if you're right, what kind of world am I bringing this child into? What right do I have to bring a child into this world, this world of pain and suffering? And this baby is already suffering. I can feel it inside of me, and I can't be his guide. Just look at me. What am I? I can't, I can't do it, I can't do it. Look at me, I can't, I can't do it. - Okay, it's okay. We're gonna help your baby, okay? Okay, it's okay, honey. We're gonna get you to the hospital, okay? - Mom! - Hey, what are doing? - Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! - Get off her! Oh my God! Father, help her for Christ sake. Peter, Peter, Peter. Get down there, help your mother. - How could you? - Peter, stop that! Peter, stop it. Oh my God, stop it. I'm trying to keep her. Oh my God, oh my God. - Oh my God, bloody hell! Quickly Father! Damn you with the fucking holy water, get her with the holy water. - For the love of God, release this child. - Oh my God! Peter, go check on your mother and make sure she's fine. - Yeah, keep going. - Yeah, it seems to be doing something. More holy water. - The power of Christ! - It compels you. - Keep her still, keep her still! - Mom's still alive. - Oh, thank God, son. Is she okay? - Yeah. - Oh God. - Dad, her water broke. - Ah, fuck me. - She's in labor. - Thank you, Ally, I get it. I know how this works. - She's having a baby now? - Well, it seems like it innit? - What are we gonna do? - She's having a baby. Untie her leg, untie it. - Do you guys want me to keep going with this, or should I? - Just deal with one thing at a time. Just deal with one thing at a time. Peter, go grab a latex gloves, scissors and all. - I think that we should take her to a hospital. - And push, push! Good boy, come here, bring that. Bring me the towel, hand me the towel. Good lad, good lad. It's all gonna be okay. Oka, all right. Scissors, scissors, mate. All right, just push, push and breathe. - I can't. - Oh, fuck me! - What the fuck is that? Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding! Just keep going, just keep going. You're doing very well. Fucking keep going, love, fucking hell. - Come on, you can do it. - Push, push, push, focus! - Yes, you can. - You can do it, keep going. You're doing good. It's nearly there. - I can't, I can't. - Keep going! - I can't, I can't! - Go, one more push, one more push! - Oh my God, what is that? - What is it? - What is that? - Dad! - Dad, oh my God! - Get it off! - Bloody hell! - The ring, it's getting the ring! Don't let it escape! - Don't let it get away. - Oh shit! - Pull Peter, pull, pull! - Ally! - Get the ring, get the ring, get the ring! - Stand back! - Go for it, go off my son! - Get ja ja, bro. You're trash, go back to hell. - What the fuck was that, Frank? - I dunno, it was a baby, I guess. Oh, how's the other baby? - The other baby? - Oh yeah, the human baby. - Herma's baby. - Can you guys show me this baby, please? - He is a beautiful baby boy. - Well, nice work there, mate. I suppose this is just a day in the life of a priest innit? - Possibly, I was just ordained last week. - Hey, it's okay, it's okay. Don't worry, honey. You basically look human again. You might have a bit of scarring, but your appearance should return to normal. - Thank God. What happened? - You gave birth to a healthy baby boy. - And a little demon Gremlin baby. - What? - It was awesome. It was sucking out the baby's head, and then it grabbed on to dad's arm and he yelled at, mom, stop. - You are such a liar. You were pissing your pants. - Just because something is scary, doesn't mean it can't be cool. - That's enough. - We're just glad that you're awake, my child. - Me too. Who are you? - I'm Father Bresson. - His name's Ron Bresson. - Nice to meet you, Father. - All right, why don't we give them some time to get to know each other, huh? - Okay, come on. - Yes, please. Hi. Keep you warm, hi. Come over here. What do you think I should name him? - If I had a baby, I think I'd name him Necromancer. - Necromancer huh? - Yeah. - Well, I will take that into consideration. Thank you. You should go get some lunch with your family. I'm sure they're looking for you. - It's my grandfather's name actually. - Yeah, I get, kind of like innit? - Peter, come on.
