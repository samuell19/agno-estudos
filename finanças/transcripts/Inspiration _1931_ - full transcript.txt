My friends. I propose to drink a toast. A toast. To a lady whose beautiful face is immortalised .. In the paintings of our good friend, Jouvet. Whose graceful figure will live forever in the marble of our good chum Coutant. You flatter me. And whose wit and charm. Is registered in that scintillating book of love by our good friend Galand. You are too gracious. And if I may add my own undistinguished name. To a lady whose gracious presence will live always in my heart. In simple words, my friends. I propose that we drink a toast to .. Your inspiration. Yvonne. Well. If I didn't know you all so well I would be flattered. Isn't she gorgeous. Who is she? Who is she? You don't get around much, do you. Well, this is my first big party. That is Yvonne Valbret. She is as well known as the Eiffel tower. And twice as beautiful. She is fascinating. Half the men in Paris are crazy about her. And the other half are trying to forget her. You know there are tricks in every trade. You ought to know, dearie. Your trade is the oldest. Well, you are not deserting us? Dare I stay .. With four of the most wicked men in Paris? Look at her. The queen of the studio. Listen, dearie. She makes the rest of you trollops look like scrub women. Come on, Fou-Fou. Shall we join the ladies? A glass of champagne. You seem so lonely, Yvonne. No more than usual. Why do you treat me like this? Well, I think I am being very nice to you. You know I am still insane about you. You artists. Really, you are insane about nothing but yourselves. How can you say that after what we have been? But that is all over, Henry. Let me come and see you sometime. Friendly. I am afraid that is impossible. You are not even listening. What did you say? Nothing is the same since you left. My work. It has gone to pieces. There you are. Always your work. You were more than my model. You were my .. Yes, I know. Your 'inspiration'. I wish you knew how tired I am of artists. Come, Henry. Your new model is looking for you. I thought you were bringing me a drink. He was on his way to you when I interrupted. Do forgive me. Well, are you having a good time, my pet? I was never so thrilled in my life. But you must be ashamed of me. My poor child. Why should I be ashamed of you? I am such a nobody among all these famous people. You are the most charming little nobody I have ever met. Don't you believe a word he says. But he says such lovely things. May I have this dance? That is if Mr Delval doesn't mind. But I do mind very much. But, as long as it is you. Run along my child. Amuse yourself. I'll be right back. As soon as it's over. Charming, isn't she. - Very. And so young. Oh no. She is not too young. Nearly eighteen. Where did you find her? At the usual place. The front row. Why, you and your chorus girls. Why do you always choose that kind, Raymond? Just playing safe. I am reasonably sure of getting tired of them before they get tired of m. What are you thinking about? I was just thinking what a pity it is that all the new men that want me .. Are all artiest. That is the way they seem to you, eh? Poor old Coutant. He is still in love with you. One can't expect these things to last forever. Are you really as heartless as you seem, Yvonne? What would you want me to do? If Coutant had been in my place he would have done the same thing to me. You're all alike. You men. You only want the satisfaction of being through with us first. That's all. So far, I have had the good fortune of beating you to it. So .. I am heartless. Who are you staring at so intently? Who is the boy over there? Huh? I haven't the faintest idea. Somebody must have brought him. Oh, come along. I've engaged a troupe of Circassians. They will perform their night dance for us. Don't wait for me. Ah. I like your eyes. Who are you? My name is Andr?. Andr?? Just Andr?? Andr? Montell. How old are you? Twenty-four. Artist? No, Mademoiselle. Thank heaven. Are you having a good time here? Well, you see. I don't many of these people. I know too many of them. I don't think I shall stay much longer. No. I don't think I shall either. Did you come here with .. With a lady? - No, Mademoiselle. No? Did you? Did I? Well, I was going to ask if you came with a gentleman. Yes, I did. Oh. But that doesn't mean that he is taking me home. Shall we go? So I took the bag up the apartment and gave it to her. Did she give you a reward? I'll say she did. [ Laughter ] Look. Here comes your madam. Get going. Let's take that. It will be fun to drive in this. - It seems a shame to wake them up. Where do you live? Where do you live? 99 Rue Quarante. Do you want a drink, darling? - Have you seen Yvonne, Lulu? Yes. I saw her with her wrap on, going out. Oh, boo-boo doesn't like it. - Out where? Out of the door of course. She wouldn't go out of the window, would she? There isn't very much to tell. I am not very interesting. I am only a student. I think that is interesting. I am sure you must study something very important. I am studying for the consular service. I am very much impressed. I go to Africa in three months. That is too bad. I mean of course, it is wonderful for you. But I am doing all the talking. Please, let's talk about you. There isn't much to tell. I am just a nice young woman. Not too young. And not too nice. I hope. [ Door knocks ] Who is it? Where is your mistress? She hasn't come in yet. - You are lying. If you know so much go and see for yourself. I will. Yvonne. Yvonne. Yvonne. Yvonne. Here we are. It is not much of a place. I think it is charming. Shall I wait for sir? It would be a shame to keep the poor horse waiting. Giddy-up. We mustn't wake the concierge. Why? Is he a grouch? - No. But his wife is. Where are your rooms? At the top. Way up there? That's not far. It's only three flights. Only three flights? Let's go. I haven't done any climbing since I was in the Alps. Well, that is supposed to be bad luck. You mean good luck. You shouldn't be superstitious. The cat wasn't expecting us. I wouldn't do this for anybody else. I am sorry there isn't an elevator. Look. The dawn. Say something magic about the first dawn that two people see together. I cannot go another step. I am so tired. Come on. I'll carry you. You couldn't. - Oh no? No. Will that be all, Monsieur? Will that be all, Monsieur? Look what I have brought you, Andr?. Thanks. So that is how you appreciate the massage for my hands. Did you ever see anything so lovely? Never. Really. I meant the flowers. And you haven't had your coffee yet. How many lumps? Wait a minute. I remember. One. Two. And lots of milk. There. I wish I could always see you across the breakfast table. 'Always' is a dangerous word, Andr?. Did you have enough breakfast? A perfect breakfast. A perfect morning. Perfect everything. You know, this is a marvellous place. How did you know about it? Oh, it is quite a well-known place. Have you ever been here before? I should hate to think you had been here with anyone else. Andr?. Nothing that happened before I met you matters. I feel sorry for them. Who? For All the people that aren't in love. We are as far away from the world as if we were alone in the enchanted forest. Is that so? 'Darling. I wish I could always face you across the breakfast table'. 'How many lumps, dear'? Don't run away. We will be right down. Be careful, darling. You will break your neck. Aha. So you are trying to get away from us, huh? Do you know Mr Montell? - I don't but I am going to. I have a suspicion you are not very glad to see us, Yvonne. Of course I am. So. You haven't tired of each other, yet? We haven't made the stupid mistake of coming down to earth. I know you. Bluebeard with a shave. Trying to break poor little girls' hearts. Go on. Go on, Lulu. I enjoy it. Well, we must be getting back to town. Andr?, will you get my things for me? We must be leaving. - Surely. Excuse me. I thought you were staying here. Oh no. We just drove down for breakfast. Delval, will you talk some sense into her. Do you know what she had done? She has left Vignaud for this boy. Maybe it is love. Well, it's her funeral. Yvonne. Is he in love with you? If I could only be sure. And you are not even sure of that? Oh, I wouldn't waste a minute on him. I have wasted years on other men. And what have it got from it? Nothing. Well, I think they have been very sweet to you financially, dear. And don't forget that poor Normand went to prison for you. They have all made the same mistake. I never wanted the things they could give me. Oh, how little they knew me. Alright. But just you wait until your precious Andr? finds out about you. He won't find out. He is leaving for Africa in three months. And you would give up Vignaud with all of his money? Security for the rest of your life just for a few months? I would give it up for just an hour. I can't talk to you anymore. You are out of your mind. And you will end up in the gutter. That may not be so bad. I know some very nice people in the gutter. Here you are. So long. - So long, darling. Goodbye. Goodbye, you two lovebirds. And Liane. Don't ever let him come down to earth. Father and child doing very well. Bye-bye. Bye-bye, dear. - Goodbye. See you in town, darling. - Yes. And they just drove down for breakfast. [ Door knocks ] Darling, I .. Oh uncle Julian. How are you? - I am splendid .. darling. Sorry to disappoint you my boy. And aunt Pauline. No wonder you are pale and thin with all those stairs to climb. Didn't we surprise you? - We did. Well, I am terribly glad to see you. I am Madeleine. You know, Madeleine Dorety. Not little Madeleine? Please don't tell me how I've grown. I won't but I was going to. Because you have really. I hardly knew you. Now, is that any way to greet a playmate you haven't see for years? You're not too grown up to kiss her, young man. Please, aunt Pauline. Go ahead, stupid. Kiss her, kiss her. I've just been in the country paying your aunt a visit. Yes, she came up with us. - What on earth are you doing in Paris? Now that's a nice question to ask after we have come all this way to visit you. Did you think we wouldn't miss you just because you had gone away? Why, if Madeleine hadn't taken pity. It wasn't pity, aunt Pauline. I loved being there. It is such fun Andr? to visit the places where we used to play. It is just the same as it was five years ago. Do you remember Pierre's old dog? You know, the one that used to chase us. - Oh yes. Well, he just had 4 little puppies. He did, huh? Madeleine is spending the winter in Paris, Andr?. That is nice. I hope I will see you. [ Door knocks ] Oh, that must be the concierge. Yes, of course. Of course. I'll see what he wants and come right back. Yes, do that. He must want something important from the way he is knocking. I am sorry, Yvonne but you can't come in. I can't? - Uhuh. Who's that woman? What's she doing here? - That is my aunt. That is not the one I mean. The one you called Madeleine. She is just an old playmate. An old playmate? She doesn't sound old. Now, don't be silly, Yvonne. She is practically one of the family. I see. You are in love with her. - No I am not. She is in love with you then. - No. She is not. How couldn't she be? Who is she? This is no place to tell the story of her life. Any moment my aunt may come out on to that landing. Well, what if she does? Yvonne, will you please go home? - No. I don't want to go home. Do you love me? If I say yes will you go home? - No. But I won't stay. Yvonne. Andr?, don't you love me at all? Not when you act like this. No. No? I suppose I will have to go then. But I will come right back. No. No. Tonight then? - Not while they're in town. Will you come to my house tonight? - I can't. Tomorrow? If they are gone, yes. - Oh no. Whether they are gone or not. - But I can't while they are still here. I'll wait. Alright. I will come tomorrow. Goodbye, Andr?. Goodbye. Oh, Andr?. Shush. What? Come here. - No. Wait, wait, wait. I will come right down. Kiss me. She is not here. She is in the country. I don't know. She didn't say. No, sir. Tell him I am not coming back. She said to tell you .. I mean .. she is not coming back. Oh. Oh, I couldn't tell her that. He hung up on me. Do you wonder? Martha. What a poor liar you are. Well, I don't like to, madame. Not even for you. Besides. Lying is a sin. And you always get found out. Even just now, Monsieur didn't believe me. He said .. I am not interested in what he said. What am I to do with his flowers? - Throw them out in the alley. Oh dear, dear. Don't you think you are making a mistake? Martha, will you get this once and for all. I have finished with Monsieur Vignaud. I don't want to see him again. You will be sorry. So you keep telling me. Rich men don't grow on trees. Well, who said I wanted a rich man? But dear, dear. Whatever is going to happen to you? You are very silly, Martha. You know. I think I should have worn the pink. Be honest, Martha. How do I look? Oh .. beautiful. Too beautiful for a fellow without a penny to his name. You don't understand. [ Doorbell ] There he is. Go and let him in. What do you keep standing there for? Go to the door. But you are throwing yourself away. Shall I go to the door myself? Mademoiselle Valbret is expecting me. Well, the door is open. I guess you know where to find her. You have been here often enough. Mademoiselle Valbret is not at home. Oh I see. Well, in that case I will go. But you might tell her that Monsieur Montell .. A friend from the country called. Yes. It seems so long since I saw you. Well, it has been a long time. All of seven hours. Why, that is ages, Andr?. Look, you brought me roses. Now haven't I told you mustn't waste your money on flowers for me? They are beautiful. Martha. I want those in the silver bowl. Put them there where I can see them the first thing in the morning. You know, I think Martha has designs on me. Poor Martha. You mustn't pay any attention to her. Come. I can't decide whether to sit here where I can look at you .. or there. Where I can hold your hand. You know, Andr?. I wish you didn't mean everything in my life. But you do. And I am afraid I love you more and more every moment. The days fly so fast. Soon, you will be going away. Not for a long time yet. When I think about it my heart stops beating. Then let's not think about it, huh? I can't help it. Mademoiselle Valbret. If you insist upon thinking. I shall to leave this place at once. Oh. Well, Monsieur Montell. In that case I promise you .. If you stay. I shall never think again. Madame is not home. - She is at home. Madame is engaged. She cannot see you. I will see about that. - Please, Monsieur. I will tell madame you are here. How dare you intrude like this. Intrude? - Yes, intrude. This is my house and when you are not invited you intrude. Your house? Where have you been? I have tried to .. - That is my affair. It's my affair too. As long as I am paying .. - You are being very tiresome. Martha. Oh. So you will turn me out of my own house. As long as I am living in it, it's my house. I am sorry this happened. I assure you I didn't know. Andr?. Oh, don't go. Yvonne. Haven't you said enough? - Please forgive me. I wouldn't have done this to you for all the world. I only came here because I am out of my mind at the way you've treated me. Yvonne. Please go now. Well .. I told you. Now they are both gone. But I think Monsieur Vignaud would come back. Shall I telephone him? It's shame to waste the nice dinner I have cooked. Get me some clothes, Martha. Where are you going? Where am I going? To Andr?, of course. You are a fool. Alright. I am a fool. Andr?. Andr?. Please. What do you want? I haven't come to bother you, Andr?. I will go away again. I want only to explain to you. There is nothing to explain. But there is, Andr?. Listen, won't you? For just a little .. I didn't mean to deceive you. I thought you knew. I never dreamt you didn't know. I am not blaming you. It was stupid of me not to know. The way you went with me that night. But I was so fascinated that I never even thought. You were different from anyone I'd ever known. Andr?. But now that I do know I can't go on. Surely you must see that? We are not in the same world, Yvonne. Our lives are a million miles apart. But I have given him up. I haven't even seen him since I met you. I've told him I am through. - Don't give him up on my account. I couldn't take his place. I have never loved anyone before. You must see that. - I am sorry, Yvonne. But surely you must see how impossible it is for me to .. I know what you are going to say. I don't expect you to feel the same again. But I couldn't take care of you. I have no money. I know. I don't expect that, Andr?. Alright. I will go. Do one thing though, Andr?. Only one. Try to forget tonight. Remember the happy times we've had together. We have been happy. You can't take that away from me. Will you remember them as they were before this happened? Andr?. Won't you say goodbye to me? Oh no. Tired? Yes. You know. It has been so long since I posed. Just a few minutes more, my dear. I want to finish this. Coutant. Come, come. You are not going to work all night. Yvonne, where are you? Yvonne. Now, I ask you not to come in here while I am working. Oh, I have a suspicion the master doesn't want us to be here. And shut the door after you. Yes, master. I withdraw. Salaam. Who will have another? - I will. A cocktail, my dear? Fine. I mix these myself. I prefer your cocktails to your poems. Poetry puts me to sleep. I wouldn't expect you ladies to know good poetry but a cocktail is .. Thank you. Would you take one to Coutant? - Oh, let him get it himself. What's the matter with her? You greedy little beast. Who is that? - Oh, her? Oh no. She is crazy with jealousy. Can you blame her? After all, she was Coutant's model for months and then he takes Yvonne back. Isn't he ever going to quit work? - He said in a few minutes. The old boy takes his work seriously. Or his model? Perhaps someone can tell me why Yvonne started posing again. Why? Because she likes to eat once in a while. You're not the only weak woman with a strong appetite. Poor Yvonne. - What is all the mystery? Why won't he let you stay in there? Yvonne objects. She refuses to pose with any profane eyes feasting on her pure white body. That is funny. - Yvonne has always .. How does she get off going moral all of a sudden? She is in love. - Don't be a fool. She's trying to get Coutant back. You know, she pulls the old 'innocent schoolgirl' act. Well, there's one nice thing about the sewers of Paris. One can always ride around in a boat. You are not inferring Odette has a low mind? I wouldn't call it a mind, dear. But it certainly is low. Yvonne. Hello. Has a young man called for me? I haven't seen a young man since the war. Madam Lulu, you are breaking my heart. The lovely Yvonne. Now we are all happy. You are back with us again. And it is nice to see you all. Has anyone a cigarette for me? - Yes. I have one. Here. Take one of mine. Please. Here we are. All together. Thank you. Oh, I am tired. All in the cause of art. Just what is your 'art', my dear? Odette, where is thy sting? Hello, Odette. - Hello. Will you have a cocktail? - It's what you need, dear. A drink. Young and old. Brightens the eye, sweetens the breath. I must get some clothes on. - No. You can't go yet. Did I hear the word cocktail? Yvonne. Who said she was going? Your first day back with the old crowd. We must celebrate. You were away so long we thought you'd entered a convent. Let's drink to the return of the prodigal. I must go really. Someone is calling for me at 5 o'clock. Not the boy you kidnapped at Delval's party? It will be nice for him to meet all of your other .. Friends. Yvonne, dear. Raymond and I want you to have dinner with us one night this week. Yes. Why not make it tonight? You're not going to take her away. She just came back. Monsieur Montell. Andr?, come in. You remember Mr Montell don't you, Liane? Yes, of course. How do you do. - How do you do. And Lulu and Gaby. So nice to see you again. - Thank you very much. Monsieur Coutant. Delighted. Jouvet. Hello. Galand. - How do you do. Gavarni. - How are you? Delval. How are you, my boy? A cocktail? - No, thank you. Aren't we going to have anything to eat? Oh yes. I am as empty as a barrel. And twice the size. I thought you would never get here. I am sorry if I kept you waiting. I think you will find my friends amusing. They seem to amuse you. You are .. Your gown isn't very formal is it. I told you I was going for of clothes. Well, I am not used to this gay bohemian life. You mustn't mind these swells. They are just artists. As harmless as choirboys I suppose. No, you mustn't think that. - Alright, darling. I won't. I am going to slip my dress on. I won't be a minute. Come here you nice boy. I saw him first. Would you like a sip? No, Thank you very much. Gaby. Does he remind you of someone? Yes, but I can't think who. The same hair. The eyes. Normand. - Oh, of course. And who is Normand? - Oh .. Just a friend of ours. - Yvonne. Do you still visit him at the jail? - Yes. What's he in jail for? Ah. He was in love, the poor fellow. The lady demanded lot of money and Normand forged a few checks. Yvonne has been marvellous. She is the only one of us who stood by him. You have such a sweet nature, dear. Jouvet. Are you going to exhibit in the salon this fall? Yes. That canvas I painted last year. Yvonne as Aphrodite. Wearing three moonbeams and a smile. I remember when you took Yvonne to Italy to paint it. Say, we must be running along. - Oh, no. You can't go so soon. The party is just beginning. Galand is going to read to us from his own work. Come on, Galand. Read the sonnet you wrote to Yvonne while you were in Algeria together. Odette, you are drunk. - You've said enough. Are you telling me what I can say? - Odette. You'll not get rid of me so easily. I'll not sit and let that woman work for Coutant again. Somebody stop her please. - Shut up, Odette. I'll say what I please. I'm the injured party. Coutant, you told me it was all over between you and Yvonne. Now she is posing for you again. That means she is back here like she was. Please. Surely, you're not going to allow this .. This woman to .. Well, this is all very unfortunate. Yvonne, we must be going. - Now look here. I am sorry. I could listen to her talking that way about you. What sort of people are they, not telling her she lied? I knew she was lying. Why, you wouldn't have allowed me to come if those men had been .. What is the matter? What is it? What she said isn't true. I couldn't be. Is it Yvonne? Well. Andr?. You? Oh, I wish I could make you understand. All those men laughing at me. Yes. But that is all so long ago. I never cared for any of those men. Not one. I swear to you. That part of my life is over. Forgotten. It has nothing to do with my love for you. Don't use the word 'love'. It sounds vile coming from you. Well. I only came back here to work. It is the only way I know to earn a living. I'll give it up in you want me to. - I want to forget I ever knew you. [ Laughter ] What is the matter with you? We can't have this sort of thing. Please. I was wrong to come here. Oh come now. After all, this boy isn't so important. No. Only my life. That's all. The papers said rain. - What are you going to do tonight? What's your program? - Study. The way that bird wastes his time. Say, Andr?. Andr?. What? A check. How about dinner tonight? A bottle of wine. Dollies, etc. Maybe two cute little etceteras? I can't. I am dining with my uncle. Blond or brunette? - No. Really I am. Madeleine plays very well. I've always insisted that she keep up her music. Andr? adores music. I want you to hear Madeleine playing Liebestraum. That has always been a favourite of mine. Of course I haven't felt the same about German music since the war. But then Liebestraum was written before the war, wasn't it. After all, she is our only child. We cannot afford to allow her to make a mistake. They've been together for months. Just look at the child and see she loves him. How about this .. this other woman? A wild rose only. It doesn't amount to anything. Besides, you were young yourself once. - Yes, but .. I seem to recall a similar incident. It must be all of thirty years ago. A charming young dancer. Yes. But we won't go into that now. - There you are. Andr? is no different to any young fellow. But suppose this affair was serious? - No. It is finished, I assure you. The woman might make trouble. - Impossible. I've met her. And I must say she seems rather superior to ladies of her sort. No. You have nothing to fear from her. You are sure Andr? shares your enthusiasm for this match? My dear friend, I can speak for him. My wife and I are the only family he has. We'll talk this over tomorrow morning in my office. And arrange the details. - Perfectly satisfactory to me. Yes. I can think of no reason for keeping it a secret. I have an exceedingly important announcement to make. Perhaps you can guess what it is. Oh, Andr?. - My boy, I congratulate you. Oh, my dear boy. - I am sure you will be happy. All our friends will be so delighted. You are ideal. A coffee with milk and a roll. How much? - Two franks 50. But I am sorry. I haven't enough money. Just a moment. But haven't touched it. But I can't separate the milk from the coffee. I am a waiter, not a sleight-of-hand artist. Please. I really didn't know. - I know how you swindlers work. This is a case for the police. If Mademoiselle will permit me. Pardon me. That won't be necessary. Oh, I am sorry. It is alright. Drink your coffee. - I can't. Drink your coffee. I must go. I am so ashamed. I couldn't stay. We will find another caf?. Clever? That one. Caf? Dijon. It was kind of you to take me to dinner, Andr?. Well, goodnight. Won't you come in? I am sorry. I can't. For only a minute. I can't stay. Wait here. I will call you. Alright. You can come in now. Sit down. Why didn't you let me know you had to live like this? It is alright when you get used to it. But you can't go on living here. Now please don't worry about me. Do you .. Do you hate me so much? I am not blaming you. It's not your fault. What happened was inevitable because .. Well. Your idea of love is different from mine. Well, if you knew how my life has been. You would understand how wonderful our love was. To me. Don't you think it meant something to me too? After that ghastly day I couldn't sleep. I couldn't work. I felt as if I was going to go out of my mind. You see. I am different from those other men. I have never been in love before. It wasn't easy for me to forget. I'm afraid I'm taking like a schoolboy. It is getting late. I can't .. I can't let you go on living here. We'll find another place tomorrow. Andr?. I will call for you in the morning. Goodbye. [ Door knocks ] Come in. Oh. Well, what a nice surprise. Hello, Yvonne. - Hello. Hello darling. And Lulu. It is wonderful to see you all. Darling, I've tried to get down to see you for weeks. But I couldn't because of poor Boo-boo. Something happened to Boo-boo? - Something must have. She has had puppies. - No. And they look a little like police dogs. Ah, it is good that you came down too, Liane. We've thought about you so much. Haven't we, Raymond?. - Indeed we have. Everybody misses you. That's nice. You want some coffee, Raymond? - No thanks. Lulu? - Not for me, thank you. Liane? Are you as much in love as ever? You don't have to answer me. I see. He is everything in the world to me. Why, Yvonne. If he should ever leave me I think I would die. You mustn't say that. Yvonne. We came down here today to .. To just .. Well, why don't you come back to Paris? Especially in view of the fact that Andr? seems to be so occupied in town. Andr?? Yes. There's no more reason for you to bury yourself out here in the country. Well, it was Andr?'s idea. Oh. I didn't understand that. Does Andr? come down here often? Yes. Whenever he can. Lately he has been very busy though. I know just how you feel, dear. I used to be in love with a travelling man myself. We were afraid you might be getting pretty lonely down here now. Why lonely? I have never been so contented in my life. What do you so with yourself all day? Yes darling, what do you do? Well, I read cook books. No. Honestly. I am learning to cook. I had to. The meal I served I have served Andr? .. The first month. Uhoh. But then after he was here for dinner. He didn't have indigestion. Well, not very badly. So, I am beginning to feel a grand housekeeper. Well. Heavens, what is burning? Look what I have done. Excuse me a minute. The poor darling. She hasn't any idea. Evidently not. If I had my way I'd take that Andr? person out and shoot him. Well, Lulu. These things happen. It's life. Well if this is life, give me cod liver oil. What are we going to do? We can't tell her. There. You would never know it. Yvonne, I don't want you to misunderstand me. But if you need .. That is very kind of you, Raymond. What could I need? I have everything. Well. I just thought in case .. But thank you ever so much. [ Door knocks ] Excuse me. Oh Andr? .. I didn't expect you for hours. We have visitors. How are you, Montell? - Well, this is a surprise. You are not going already? - Yes, my dear. We must. It is a long drive back to town. Andr?, ask them to stay. Now darling, don't try to be polite. I know that you would much rather be alone. How did you guess that? Will you come back please? Soon. Yes, dear. Goodbye. - Goodbye. If you ever need me, darling. You know where I am. Goodbye, Lulu. - Goodbye, darling. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Your friends seemed rather cool to me. How could you let them see you looking like that? Well, it is cold and I haven't much to put on. I am nice underneath though. Don't scold me. You look tired, Andr?. I think you work too hard. - I am alright. You know. I have been looking for you all week. I am not reproaching you. I tried to get down before. Well, now that you are here living is alright. Sit down. Tell me all you have been doing. I hope you have been lonesome for me. Why, of course. You will stay for dinner? I can't. Oh, Andr?. I am sorry but it can't be helped. Let's get out of here. Go for a walk, huh? Yes. I would love to. Wait until I get my things. You seem worried, Andr?. Is there anything wrong? Frankly, I have been worried lately. Well. Is there anything I can do to help you? I thought it may be nice for you to get someone to come down and stay with you. Lulu, perhaps? She'd be company for you. Company? You are going away? Yes. When? Soon, I am afraid. But why, Andr?? Well. The man I was to succeed in Algiers .. Is ill. I must go and take his place. It all happened rather suddenly. Look at me. You are keeping something from me. Well, what is it? Yvonne. I .. I have something to tell you. I don't know quite .. Quite how to .. You are going to get married? - Oh. It isn't true. It can't be. Well. Have you told her about me? Yes. And she forgives you? Does she know what we have been to each other? That you've gone to her with my kisses? Yvonne, please. All the time that you have been in Paris. Pretending to be busy. You have been with her. And everyone knew. All my friends. That is why they .. If you were tired of me .. Why didn't you have the courage to say so? You want to marry that girl? Alright. You go to her. I am sick of you. Marry her. But when she bores you .. Don't think you can come crawling back to me. Go! You coward, you liar. I was a coward and a liar to go on as we have. I. That is why I came here. Today. - Don't say anything more. I know. I think it is best that you go now, Andr?. If. If there is anything I can do. I just want to be alone for a little while here. Well. I've always felt that these stairs .. Were very good for my waistline. You won't be climbing them again. Now, now, now. Let's not be sad about this thing. Well? There is just time go get home. Pack my things and catch my train. Must you go? I don't want to but it is business. You will be gone a long time? I can't tell. So, I am leaving this check with you. That will take care of you for a year. Then. This is the end. Now, now, now. I thought we talked this all over during dinner .. And you promised to be a good girl. No tears. No. No tears. Besides. These things. Must end sometime. These things? Well. Romance and love. That can't go on forever. You know the world we live in. We are civilised. We make our own laws. You are going to be alright, child. You are going to have a grand time after I have gone. I'll have a wager that you will forget all about me in a month. In an hour. In an hour? Well. That's not very flattering. Come, come now. I want to see you smile. There. That is better. I don't want to see you go. Well. I'll tell you what you do. Close your eyes. Because we agreed not to say goodbye. I don't like goodbyes. So. And when is the happy event to take place? In a week. A week from tomorrow. My boy. May the cradle never be empty. He doesn't look like a very happy bridegroom. Liane has killed herself. My word. Delval's little friend. I really don't know. Why, it's you. So pale. What is it? I .. Oh. Monsieur Montell - Monsieur Normand. If you don't mind I .. I will wait outside. It is after midnight, Andr?. There is no train. How did you come down from Paris? A taxi. That is expensive. You must have been anxious to see me. I .. I have been thinking. What's the matter, Andr?? Well, my letters. I thought perhaps .. Your letters? I have them all. Do you want them? Is that why you came? Yes. That isn't true. You came here because you wanted to see me. I came for my letters. Oh. Well, I will give them to you. Well, they aren't in a neat package tied with a blue ribbon. Because I have been reading them over again lately. They are beautiful letters. So, he is out of prison? Yes. He was released today. And came straight to you. Are you going to take him back? Are you not jealous? Jealous of a convict? You didn't come here because of your letters. I must know if you're going to take him back. He has asked me to marry him. Surely you are not? - Well .. He is beginning life all over again. Why shouldn't I? You can't go with him, Yvonne. Would that make any difference to you? No. No. Of course not. May I ask .. just why did you come tonight? Why? Because I couldn't stand it any longer. I was crazy with worry. When I read this. Oh. Liane. It was driving me out of my mind. I walked the streets for hours. Thinking of you. Poor Liane. Well, she had more courage than I have. So, you have been worried about me? Yvonne, I can't let you go. You love me then? I won't let any other man have you. We'll go away. Any place, just so long as we are together. You feel this way tonight because another man wants me. Maybe tomorrow you will .. - I won't ever leave you again. What about your marriage? Let's not mention that. I can't go through with it. And your work? I'll give it up. Do you know what it means? - It doesn't matter. Andr?. You do love me. Say it. I want to hear you say that. I love you. That makes up for all the misery. Now. Go and tell Normand. Yes. Well, Normand. I know. I thought he was never coming back but .. You love him very much. We can't help it. Tell me, Normand. With these things happening to us. No. Do you still want to marry me? My dear, I have always wanted to. Knowing that Andr? .. All I ask is to be with you. To take care of you for the rest of your life. That is a strange bargain. Alright. I will meet you in Paris tomorrow. I will be waiting for you. Did you tell him? Yes. I told him. Good. That's over. Now we can go away together. And forget all the wretchedness we've been through. [ Music ] Do you remember .. this melody? They played in the caf?. The night you came back to me. I have played it over and over. When I have been alone. You will never be lonely again. We'll be together always. Always. I think l can get a position in South America. That is far enough away to .. Let's not think of the future. Let's just have this moment. We have years. But this moment is so precious. I want to keep it. I want to think of this old room. And all the places where we have been .. Happy. I want to remember you. As you are tonight. ..(r0s)..
