The magic of animation is a result of the talent and hard work of hundreds of artists and craftsman including the animator. Now to create the action for the Stone Age world of the Flintstone family this artist has sketched nearly 100 separate drawings to make Fred Flintstone come to life for just five seconds. Now, most of us are as familiar with Fred Flintstone as we are with members of our own family. Fred, Wilma, and the rest of the Flintstone gang were created nearly twenty years ago. They were the stars of the first half-hour animated program on Prime Time Television. They were an instant hit and they had been with us ever since.
