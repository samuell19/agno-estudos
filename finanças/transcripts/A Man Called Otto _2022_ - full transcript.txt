Welcome to the store. Are you a Busy Beaver? No, I am not a Busy Beaver. Are you a Frequent Beaver? Join our rewards club for savings. You can get your teeth into our dam good deals. Don't forget: If you need help, ask a Beaver. Oh. Oh. Hey. Oh. Can I, uh, help you with that, sir? Do you think I don't know how to cut rope? No, it's just we usually do that for ya. Do you think I'm gonna cut myself and bleed all over your floor and sue you? No. Then I don't need your help. Have an excellent day. I'm a Busy Beaver. Idiot. Did you, um, find everything you were lookin' for today? Yes. Good. Let's see here. Uh, your total is 3.47. You charged me for 6 feet of rope. Oh, yes, it's 99¢ a yard. I didn't get 2 yards. I got 5 feet. Yeah, we don't charge by the foot. We charge by the yard. 99¢ a yard is 33¢ a foot, times 5, that's 1.65. You charged me $1.98. You're good at math. Um... No, I know, but I can't put it into the computer the way that you just said. What the hell kind of computer can't do simple math? -Can I speak to your manager? -He's at lunch. Lunch. All anyone cares about these days is lunch. -Is there anyone else in charge? -You want the assistant manager? -Yes, I'd like the assistant manager. -'Kay. Hey, Taylor? Taylor? To the front register. What's up? Hey, Taylor. This is the assistant manager? How old is she? Shouldn't you be in gym class? Sorry, what? Here. I got some change. Let me cover that extra 33¢ for you. Sir, I do not want your 33¢. And this is not about 33¢. This is about the fact that I got 5 feet of rope because I want 5 feet of rope. And I shouldn't have to pay for 6 feet of rope if I don't want 6 feet. Did you want another foot of rope? Not again. Hm. How hard can this be? That bike goes over here. Hey! What the hell? That's mine. -It belongs in the bike rack. -I was only gone half a minute. Next time, I'll lock it up in the lost and found. Grumpy old bastard. Jeez. Not on the mirror. Hey, Otto! Okay. Hey! Don't you dare let that little rat dog piss on my walkway again. -I know it was you. -Ignore him, Prince. He's a nasty, bitter old man. And he has no idea who's doing that. Well, it was one of you. And tell that useless boyfriend of yours to stop stretching his groin in public. Looks like a 14-year-old Romanian gymnast, for God's sakes. Go on. Get outta here. Go. There he is, the big man himself. What's all this? It's, well, retirement cake, I guess. Call it what you like. "Have fun." "Have fun." Doing what? Have fun with the rest of your life. We wanted to, you know... Celebrate? Yes! Well, no. Give you a nice send-off. "Nice." Come on, Otto. You're the one who decided to leave. And you did get a nice severance package. You took me off Operations. You cut back on my hours. You made Terry, who I trained, my supervisor. Terry, who can barely figure out what year it is without his phone. So, yes, I took the severance package. I'm sorry you see it that way. We all had to adjust after the merger. But you've been quite an asset to this company over the years, so-- You have. Reliable as hell. We're gonna miss those schedules of yours. To Otto! -To Otto! -To Otto. Okay, Otto. Want a piece of your face? Who's hungry? Look at this. No, no. Hey, hey, wait! No, no, no. Hey, you cannot use this road without a permit. I'm not parking. I just dropped off a package. The sign doesn't say anything about packages, does it? It says "permits" and you don't have one. This is not a through street. Have a nice day, sir. Every time you come in here that means one of the residents can't park in front of their homes! The other guys don't do this. The guys with the white trucks. How come it's always you brown guys? And I don't mean that racially! Hello. Oh, hi. Sorry, can you hear me? Yes. It's Susan. Susan who? I have great news about your health insurance. Oh, no, no, no. Robot, robot, robot! Well, who do I have to talk to to get this phone number disconnected? That's Account Services. Can you transfer me or should I press a number? Well, I have been listening to that music for seven minutes. I do apologise, Mr Anderson. I would like the electricity shut off at this residence. -Are you moving home? -No, I am cancelling the account. A-N-D-E-R-S-O-N. And why can't you refund me for the six days? O-T-T-O. Oh, it's policy. Well, my policy is that if I'm going to pay for six days of gas, then I will use six days of gas. Then we are done here. Idiots. Okay. Go, go, go. Stop. Go. Okay. Yeah. Stop. Back. You're in the blind spot, be careful. Use the Force. Good, good. No, you're going on the sidewalk. Okay. Back, back, back. Go away. Stop. Stop. Ah, shit. What the hell is he doing? Yes! Exactly! That's exactly what I was saying. Hey, you can't just drive here. I'm not driving. Am I driving the car? No. You can't just bring a car on this street without a permit. No, we have a parking permit. Right here. See? What the hell's it doing in your pocket?! Well, I'm the driver. We're renting here. Yeah. In 206. That doesn't mean you can back the trailer up to your front door. No, I wasn't. I was, uh, parallel parking. Parallel to what? Yeah, that, uh, didn't go so well, huh? I'll just give it another try. Oh, my God. Okay. Mm... Good. Good! Keep backing away. Keep backing away. Now go away more. Okay, I got this. The other way, but first the other way. - Easy. - Exactamente. - Easy, easy. - Uh-huh. Good. No. No, no. What? No! No, no, no! Stop! Stop, stop, stop! Stop! Stop! Stop. Get outta the car. -Get outta the car. -I'm sorry. How you could make it this far through life without knowing how to back up a trailer. My God, a dog with one front paw and cataracts coulda done better than that. And an automatic, of course. Give me the keys. Oh, they're in the cupholder. It's a push-button start. No, I knew that. What the hell is that? Uh, that's the radar. The trailer's too close to the side of the car. That's why it's still beeping, but-- Okay. Hello. Hello. What's your name? -Otto. -Otto? Otto. O-T-T-O. I'm Abbie, O-T-T-O. And I'm Luna. Nice to meet you. Oh, that was good, huh? He just did it in one shot, huh? -Perfecto! -Thank you, sir. Anyone who thinks they need to use radar to back up a car shouldn't be allowed to drive one. They shouldn't be allowed to use the radio. That's what I said. And the permit goes on the rear-view mirror. Not in your pocket! - Okay, okay. - Got it. -Bye! Thank you! -Thank you, sir. That was very nice. Idiot. You guys all ready? Okay. All right. Bring your stuff, okay? Come on, sweeties. Chiquitita, take your stuff. How much more shelf space is left? Three shelves. - How many more boxes of books do you have? - Seven or eight. "Then I'll build you another bookcase." Then I'll build you another bookcase. - Hi. - Hey. Hi. Otto. Right? Yes? Otto. Yeah, that's what I said. No? What did I say--? It doesn't matter what you said. Otto. O-T-T-O. -Ah! Otto. -Otto. Otto. Okay, so it's the same forward that is backwards. -Otto. -It's Otto, Mari. It's just you don't hear that name very often. I do. Okay. If we're interrupting, we can always come back. What is it you want? I brought you some food. Why? Because you looked hungry. That's why we go so well together. She loves to cook, and I like to eat everything. Anyway, we just, uh... We wanted to properly introduce ourselves because we're gonna be neighbours and everything, so... -So... -Okay. -Okay. -Bye. My name is Marisol. And I'm Tommy. Otto. Are you always this unfriendly? I'm not unfriendly. -I'd say you're a little unfriendly. -I'm not unfriendly. -Un poquito. -I am not. No? Okay, you're not. No, no, no, no. You're not unfriendly. Every word you say is like a warm cuddle. It really is. Enjoy it. What is it? Be careful with the salsa, please. It's, um, pollo con mole. It's really good. It's a Mexican dish. I'm Mexican. I was born in El Salvador because my father is from there. But my mom is Mexican, so we went to first Mexico and then-- -And you? -I'm an IT consultant. Oh, I'm from Anaheim. Oh, from Anaheim. Anaheim, yeah. Yeah. El Paso. Okay, well, I have some things I need to do. Excuse me, Mr Otto. You wouldn't have an Alvin wrench I could borrow, would you? You mean an Allen wrench. No, an Alvin wrench. - It's Allen wrench. - Allen wrench. It's "Allen" wrench, right? It's Allen wrench. It's Alvin. All morning, "Alvin wrench, Alvin wrench." Honey, it's Alvin, trust me. Everybody else I know calls it an Alvin wrench. -Everybody else you know is wrong. -Oh, yeah? You wanna Google it? My God. Google it! Google it! Google it. Wikipediale. Wikipediale. Give me your phone. No, my phone. You use your phone. Do you know what size you need? Ah, just the usual size. Take the set. -Thank you. -Thank you. We go because you have things to do, so... What do you want, huh? Mmm. Mmm! Hm. Mmm. Isn't she beautiful, son? That's a Chevy engine for you. Dependable. Not enough you can depend on in this world. Dad, this is Otto. That's enough now, darling. Huh. Two for $8? Maybe I should just run myself over with a car. That'll work. Found some of the flowers you like. Pink. There was a deal on 'em. On sale. Two for 8 bucks. I'm sorry I didn't get 'em here earlier. Got distracted. By some new neighbours. Nitwit husband. Didn't even know an Allen wrench from one of the Chipmunks. Renters, of course. No commitment to anything. I know, I know. Maybe they can't afford to buy yet. But what will they do when those real estate bastards decide to tear down their house and put up more of those ricky-ticky condos, huh? It's gonna happen. I promise you. They're already driving around the gates, driving right across the grass. Dye & Merika. What idiot thought that was a good name for a real estate company? Sounds like "dying America." It is, of course. Can't even buy a decent screw hook anymore. Or rope by the foot. Nothing works when you're not home. Next. I suspect you have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is a genetic enlargement of the-- I know. My father had it. Well, you'll likely be around a good long time, but I'm afraid your military prospects end here. Next. One return ticket to Pittsburgh, please. That'll be 1.10. Thank you. Coming through. Hey, you dropped your book! Miss, you dropped your book! Hey! Is that mine? What? -Yes. I saw you dropped it, so I... Thank you so much. I'm halfway through reading it. I would hate not knowing how it ends. Oh, here. Why don't you join me? I'm Sonya. I'm Otto. It was my father's name. I'm on my way to visit my father right now. I go every Thursday. Do you take this train a lot? Oh, no, I had to come into town for my Army physical. Oh, God. Oh, that must be so hard, not knowing what you're gonna face over there. -When are you leaving? -I'm not-- Not for a while. Tickets, please. Thank you. All right, thank you. I'm afraid you're on the wrong train. This is an eastbound ticket. I must have, um... I'll get off at the next station. Uh, how much is it? Uh, $1.75. One. Here. I have some change. Thank you. There you go. Thank you. Have a good day. A quarter to spare. It's 1964. -It's pure silver. -Oh? Keep it, then. It's lucky. Yes, it is. Hey, Otto! A little late for your morning rounds, isn't it? No. No? Aren't you supposed to be at work? No. Oh. Cool. You wanna come over for lunch, then? Lunch. Yeah. No, no. Well, it's pork tenderloin, in case you change your mind! No, no, no, no. Hey, excuse me. It was you. This is a private road, and these gates are to keep down the flow of traffic. Not so idiot drivers can go around them and tear up the grass. Okay. You got me. I'm with Dye & Merika. I'm gonna have the groundskeeper come down and fix that up for ya, okay? Good as new. Even better. You have a good one now, okay? The rules are here for a reason. I know what you guys are up to. Okay, Mr Anderson. Whatever you say. Keep up the neighbourhood watch. Get out here, you little bugger! Come on. Yeah. Get out here! You throw one more rock, and I swear I'll dropkick that little rat dog of yours right over the roof. No, I'm not throwing it at your house. That nasty cat scratched Prince. I'm gonna kill that piece of shit. No, you're not. What do you care? It's feral. It's probably full of all sorts of disgusting diseases. So are you, most likely. I don't throw rocks at you. Andy. - What's up? - Did you hear what he just said this time? I told you before about how he talks to me. Get outta here while you can. I'm not your friend. Dye & Merika said they'll get all the old people on this street into a home. The sooner the better! - Hello. - What now? I just wanted to bring the wrenches back. -I found one that came with the furniture. -Congratulations. And I made you some salpores de arroz. Is that chicken and mole? No. These are Salvadoran cookies. They were my father's favourite, so... They're delicious. You're gonna love 'em. Yes, because I made them. Also, Otto, I was wondering if you have a ladder I can borrow. Our window is jammed. Why do you need a ladder? Well, it's the one up there. It won't open. And you're gonna try to open it from the outside? Yeah. Right. I'll get my coat. Okay. Thank you. I like how his hands are waving. Let's put the arm in. -Good. -Anita. Uh, Otto, hate to bother you, but, um, we don't have any heat. Could you come take a look? Try bleeding your radiators. How would I go about that? By bleeding the radiators. Otto. Don't be rude. I wasn't being rude. Well, it's hard to tell the difference sometimes with Otto. Yeah. By the way, we, uh, just moved to 206. -I'm Marisol. -I'm Tommy. - Welcome, honey. - Nice meeting you. I'm Anita. My husband, Reuben, is the one who used to handle the heat. -Okay. -But we always knew a day would come when he wouldn't be able to handle things around the house any longer. Maybe Reuben should have thought of that when he organised his coup. Oh... That was a long time ago. A coup? It was a misunderstanding. It was a coup. Otto, can't you just go breathe Anita's radiators for her? No. Because you don't breathe radiators. You bleed them. - Honey, look at this ramp. - That's Sonya's. -This is what we needed for the trailer. -Put that down. Put that down! Who said you could touch that?! - Sorry. - All of you get outta here. Go, go. Take your ladder and go. Get outta here. All of you. - Okay. - Thank you. Watch out. Right. Right. - Thank you! - Thank you! No. What are you doing in here? How did you get in here? Come on. Come on. Go! Get outta there. No, get out. Get out of there. Come on, go. Hey. Let go! Let go. You scratch me, I'll bite you. That'll teach you. Stupid cat. -Hi, Otto! -Hi, Otto! O-T-T-O. Hm. Otto. Um... I loaned you my garden hose last August. If you give it back to me, I'll bleed your radiators for you. Come in. So those new neighbours of yours, they seem quite lovely, don't you think? Lovely. Yeah, well, you may have some more new neighbours soon enough. The realty people, they've been telling us... Reuben and I have to move out. No, that's a load of crap. They don't own this house. You do. Yeah, well, that's what I said. They, uh, have been talking to our boy, Chris. Oh. Now he's saying that I can no longer take care of Reuben, that he needs to be in a special care place. And I should move into a retirement home. What does Chris know about it? He's an idiot. He always has been. They can't make you do anything. Does he even know we're here? Of course he does. Don't let him fool you. He's still in there. Um... Let me go find your hose. The whole neighbourhood is falling apart these days. They don't even have a homeowners' association anymore. No one left to keep things running. Not like we did. Now, just to be clear... I still haven't forgiven you. I just didn't realise you would fall to shit so quickly. Now... they're tearing apart everything we worked so hard to build. I haven't even left yet, and they're trying to erase us. Well, I am not staying around to see that happen. I'm leaving. - For good. - You ready for lunch? I'm making that creamed corn you like. Oh, thank you. Thank you, Otto. I'm sorry it took so long to give it back. Um, you wanna stay for lunch? Yeah, Anita made a pork tenderloin. No, I have a lot of things I have to do. Reuben, what are you doing, hon? - Let go. - What are you doing? - Let go. - Reuben. Reuben. - Let... - What are you doing? ...go. Oh, man. Try opening it from the inside a little. It's higher than I thought. I'm a little bit dizzy, honey. Mmm. Mmm.

A carburettor has to mix gas and air in just the right combination, and then the spark plug has to ignite that mixture, which drives the piston and the connecting rods and the drive shaft-- Where did you learn so much about cars? From my father. It's all we really talked about. He was a good dad. Dependable. He passed away. Two months ago. It was sudden. I'm sorry. And your mom? Don't remember her much. Just how it felt when she was gone. Why didn't you get an entrée? I ate at home. Why? So you could order whatever you wanted. Look, I lied to you. I'm sorry. I'm not in the Army. I couldn't pass my physical. If I had, at least I'd have a job now, which is what I was counting on. But I don't. And I don't know what I'm gonna do. I should go. Otto! Otto! I'm coming. I'm coming! What? What do you want? -What are you doing here? -What are you doing? -I'm looking for you. -Well, you found me. Can you please take me to the hospital? Please? Tommy fell off the ladder, and the ambulance just took him away. Well, you can drive yourself in that imported toaster you call a car. I don't have a licence. -How old are you? -Huh? Thirty. And you don't have a driver's licence? I have a driving's permit. I just never got to the other parts. How many other parts are there? Please! Focus! Please, listen! Tommy is in the hospital, and he may be dying as we speak. So are you gonna drive me to the hospital, or are you gonna make me take a bus? -I will drive you to the hospital. -Thank you. Was it so hard? Where are you going? I'm going to get the children! The children? Pick me up, pick me up! Bam everywhere. No! No! Smack, smack, smack! These dolls. Are they some kind of superheroes? Um, Luchador are wrestlers. Yeah. Wrestlers. -I found a Mr Bear book! -So I see. She wants you to read to her. Exactly. "Are You There, Baby Bear? 'Are you there, Baby Bear?' Mr Bear says. 'Where, oh where, is my Baby Bear.'" No, talk like a bear. Bears don't talk. Um, this one does. "'Where, oh where, is my Baby Bear?' 'Are you there, Baby Bear, up in that tree?'" No, it's an owl! "'There's nobody here but baby and me.' 'Are you there, Baby Bear, deep underground?'" I'm no Baby Bear. I'm Beppo! -Hi, Beppo! -Hi, Beppo! -Do you want to see a trick? -Yes! Actually, I was reading to them. "Actually, I was reading to them," Mr Bear grumbled. Say, could I borrow a coin, Mr Bear? Yes, yes, yes, please? Please, please, please? Yes, yes, yes! I need this back. Absolutely. He doesn't even own the costume. That's owned by the hospital. He's gonna have to pay for that. Beppo means happiness. He volunteers his time to be here. Otto. What the hell did you do? Nothing. Abuelo Otto hit the clown. -I did not. -Yeah, you did. Abuelo Luchadoro! Luchadoro! It was all the clown's fault. Ooh! Where is it going? Whoa, whoa, whoa... Here you go. Blow. Wow! Here it is! -How'd you do that? -Oh, it's magic. Thank you. I hope you have a magical day! -Bye! -Bye, Beppo! - Thank you. - Hang on. This isn't my quarter. Well, it came from your ear, sir, so that's a you problem. No, this isn't my quarter. "No, no, no. This is not your quarter." Look. I gave you a quarter that I said I needed back. -You want a dollar? -And you switched them on me. -The ol' switcheroo. -You gave me this quarter. Is Otto going to get in trouble? - It's just a quarter. - No, it's not. -Do you see the copper? -He's not calling the coppers. -I gave you a 1964 quarter. -Please calm down. I want it back! Where is it? -You have it on you. -Officer, help me. 129. We have a clown situation. Where is it? Let go of the clown! Sir! Sir! A-ha! 1964. Where's my toy? It's in your backpack. What pocket? There's a million pockets. What? My father used to smile like that. I'm not smiling. Exactly. You should never be mean to a clown. - What about Alvin Wrench, is he coming? - Look! -Hey, guys! -Mom, there he is! Pull the car up please, so we pick him up. Otto! - Yay! Yay! - Mm-hm. Mm-hm. - Thanks for driving us. - Bye, Abuelo Luchadoro. - Thank you, Otto. - Okay, good night. - Bye! - Thanks again, Otto. Bye, then. All right, ladies. Let's go. Look at your new leg! They look like a robot leg. Otto! Oh, my God, is he dead? No, he's probably sleeping. Otto. No, no, no, please. Please. Please. Take him out. Please. No, why can't you? Because I'm pregnant. I cannot handle the cats because I can get the toxo thing. Well, he got himself in there. He can get himself out of there. Ay. Why are you like that? I'm not good with cats. Hey, man. What's going on? Jimmy. Jimmy. We have a... Oh, no! We gotta warm you up, buddy! Oh, yeah. Oh, be careful. Oh, no. Oh, I've got you. He's so cold. Where do we go? - No. But no. Toxo. Otto. - Oh. Okay, let's go. I've got you now. Otto. Open the door. Oh, it's all right, buddy. -It's gonna be okay, chiquitito. -Poor guy. Okay. You're okay. -Snow all over my floor. -Oh, sorry. Oh, my God, it's so freezing here. Okay, how about this one? Please? No, no. Don't touch that coat. It'll stay here. -Okay. Can you please bring a blanket? -For the cat? -It's okay. I got this. -What are you doing? Oh, body heat works wonders. I've got plenty of body and heat. I'm gonna turn on the oven. You are not putting that cat in my oven. No, I'm just trying to get some heat in the house. Your counters are so low. Where did you get them? I built them. For Sonya. For my wife. Ah. Is she short too? Sonya passed away. She was a great cook though, wasn't she? I used to eat here all the time. Oh. I'm sorry. Well, can you go now? I have things to do. Well, it was great seeing ya, as usual. Oh, hey, who's gonna look after this guy? You are. Aw. Okay. Now ask me the right way. It was so beautiful too. Okay, now I'm hungry. Now I'm hungry. Let's see. "The Board of Regents hereby certifies that Otto Anderson, having completed all the requirements for a Bachelor's Degree in Engineering--" Would you ever wanna... get married? -'Cause if you did... -Look at me. Now ask me the right way. Will you...? Will you marry me? Yes. Yes! Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes! - Oh, my God! - Someone call 911. He fell down! -Somebody help him! -Get the camera on him. No, take video. Oh, for God's sake. -Who's gonna do something? -Oh, my God, he fell. -Get him off the tracks. Somebody help. -Hey! Can you move? You gotta move! Come on! You gotta get up! Will somebody help me? - Come on. - Film it, film it, film it. -Get the shot. -I have him. I see him. Zoom in on his face. -Tell me what happened. -We were going to the museum... Look at me. Say hello. Take a breath, Otto. Take my hand. Take my hand. Take my hand now! Hey, are you out of your mind? You could have been killed. Sir, you saved his life. He saved that guy's life. You're amazing. Oh, my God. That was amazing. -Whatever. Follow us. -Anyway, follow us. Hey. Are you trying to scare me to death? Look at this. Um... Abbie wanted to make a picture of her new neighbour. She wants you to have that. That's you. She always draws you in colour. What do you mean, "always"? Hm! I have a very good idea. You can be my driver's instructor. No. No, no, no. I don't have time for that. But don't worry, I'll pay for the gas and everything. Hey, there you guys are. I've been looking for ya everywhere. Hi, Jimmy. What are you doing? - Cat in there? - Yeah. Oh, jeez! Calm down, dude. He really doesn't like this. Let him out of the box. Okay. Sorry, buddy. What do you think you were doing? Taking him for a walk? Well, I had to bring him back. I forgot that I'm allergic. So... -Oh, Jimmy. -Yeah. Yeah. I put oatmeal on it, and it didn't help at all. You know what, you come with me. Tommy has a prescription from last year. -He found a wasp's nest. -Are you sure? -I don't want to be a bother. -It's okay. -Don't scratch. -I feel like I should scratch a little. Hey, hey, what about the cat? Uh, looks like he's yours now, Otto. Love him. Get in the box. Get in the box. Get in the box. Sorry I haven't come yet. It's been harder than I thought to...

I tried once. Mm. You guys, okay. Bye, Otto! -Mama's going on a ride. -Be careful, honey. -Bye, Mama! -Bye, mi vida. Have fun, guys! Bye, Mama! All right. -No more grown-ups. Come on! -Yay! Ah. Otto, pero can we go in our car? Because I've only ever driven automatic. No. I'm teaching you how to drive. Get in. Now, coming up on the red light. You're going to have to stop. Okay, but I get the clutch, right? You get the clutch and then press in on the brake. -Do I hit the brake or the clutch? -No, keep the clutch in. Put in the brake, I put the clutch. Clutch and brake. And now brake. -Brake. Brake. -No. No. - Don't shout at me. - I am not shouting at you. Clutch in. It's in, it's in! We're going to stop, and... Clutch in, and brake. Brake. Brake. Brake. The car is stopped. Don't hit the car! Brake, brake! Yes. All right, let go. Oh, my God. Brake. It's clutch and brake. I suck at this. - I suck. - You're learning. Oh, my God, I almost hit the car. It's like this. It doesn't matter. It's a hybrid. It's a hybrid, okay. -Okay, I should move back. -No, no, no. No. -You're fine right where you are. -But I'm very close. -Doesn't matter. -I don't need to go back? Just wait for the green light. And here we go. So press in on the clutch. And give it a little gas. Slowly let out on the clu-- Oh, you're not in gear. Green! Press in on the clutch, shift into fi-- You don't have to turn the key. - Go! - Just press in-- - Oh, my God. - Press in on the-- Slowly let out the clutch, -then press the gas. -I can't do this. -That is all you have to do. -I can't do this. No, Otto. Otto, no. What? Oh, shit. What is wrong with you? She's learning how to drive. Did you not have to learn how to drive? Calm down, old man. Hey, hey. I'm not your old man! You son of a bitch! If you honk that horn one more time, it'll be the last thing you do. You hear me? Huh? ¿Comprende? Oh, shit. Now you listen to me. You have given birth to two children. Soon it'll be three. You have come here from a country very far away. You learned a new language, you got yourself an education and a nitwit husband and you are holding that family together. You will have no problem learning how to drive. My God, the world is full of complete idiots who have managed to figure it out, and you are not a complete idiot. So... Clutch. Shift. Gas. Drive. Ah... Yeah. Que bueno. Que bueno. Okay, there's a spot right there. Just pull up, parallel, and back the car up until that bumper is in line with your side-view mirror. Now straighten out. Back up all the way up to the curb. -A little bit. -Well, a little bit. And stop. Neutral. Brake. Key. Is that it? That's it. And we're right on time. I have it. Uh-huh. These are semlors. -Swedish éclairs. -Oh! They're a little messy. -But let's try. -Yes. With your finger. Mmm! How did you find this place? This was Sonya's place. We used to come here every Saturday at 1:00. And then? What? Go home at 2:00. I'd wash and wax the car, and she would grade her papers and cook and spend the rest of the day reading. What kind of books? Her books. I tried to read some of them, but... I'm just... I'm not into books. Her friends said that we were like night and day. My life was black-and-white before I met Sonya. She was the colour. I would have liked her. She was a force of nature. She convinced the school to start up a programme for the kids that needed extra help. A lot of kids had problems at home or, uh, social anxieties. But by the time Sonya was done with 'em, they were reciting Shakespeare. I ran into one of her students, just the other day. A kid named Malcolm. You need more cream. Okay. We all got along fine, of course, when we first moved in. It was like a gift. Welcome to the neighbourhood. -Hi, I'm Sonya. -I'm Anita. Sonya and Anita were best friends. So I got my Allen keys... And Reuben and I were a lot alike. Hey! Slow down! About most things. Idiot. But people change. Or they don't change. Things happen. People drift apart. They build walls. They take offence. Who knows why. Maybe it was all the construction that drove everybody crazy. You know, there used to be a forest up on that hill. That's why they call it Birchwood. Then they started building all those condos and cut down all the birches. They didn't even realise what they were doing until we told them, Reuben and I. But this was before the coup? Oh, yeah, yeah. Reuben and I were friends then. After that, all we saw were the differences. A few years later, their son, Chris, he, uh, took a job in Japan, and I don't think he's been back to visit them since. -Oh. -Reuben and he never did get along. Anyway, that's when I decided to bury the hatchet. Reuben. Hey. Sonya gave me this a while back. Never found the occasion. I thought maybe we could start fresh. Hey, would you like to see my new car? Sure. It's a new model. Just came out. Voilà. A Toyota? You bought a Toyota. Celica GT convertible. Five-speed automatic. You gotta change with the times. Otto! I don't know what went wrong with Reuben, but that's when I knew I'd lost him. I mean, a man has to stand up for what he believes in. Even if it is an F-O-R-D. And you and Sonya, did you ever think about having children? Well, 2:00. Okay. Yes. I was wondering if you could help us out tonight. Me and Tommy don't get a lot of time to go out for dinner before the baby comes. I'm not gonna drive you two around on a date. No. We're gonna take a cab. What do you need me for, then? -Mama, I did not! Why would I? -Yes, you did! -Give it back! -You gotta catch me! You guys, por favor. And learn to share your everything. I'm not sure about this. No. Don't be silly. It's gonna be very fun. If you remember, Abbie has to be in bed by 9:00, okay? You're good? So, alarm code, 4491. 4491. I'm setting it to "Armed Stay." Are you paying attention? So if you wanna go out, you just have to press this button here, and it's disalarmed. I'll be right here. Right. Yeah. Well, you never know. Be good to Abuelo Otto please, okay? We will! I don't see chocolate milk in here. You make it with the syrup. But not too much. It'll keep her awake. Give me milk. What is that? That's the goddamn useless dishwasher. Dad said he wanted to throw it out the window, but Mom said Dad isn't allowed to open windows anymore. Head. Cabeza. -Cabeza. -Cabeza. Good. Eyes. Ojos. -Ojos. -Ojos. Good. Arm. Brazo. Arm. Brazo. Good. I don't think this is a good idea. Why? Because no one stands a chance against a luchadoro. Abuelo Luchadoro! Abuelo Luchadoro! Help me, help me. Wait, no, he started it. -Ready? -Rub it and smack! Rub it and smack! Smack! Karate chop! Huh. Wow, it's awfully quiet, huh? Hey, guys. Hi. Hi. She was already asleep. How was it? -Fine. -You did a good job tonight, Otto. You should pat yourself on the back. - Thank you, Otto. - Yeah. Exit now. Have a good night. Okay. How did he do that? - Hi, Otto. - Malcolm. You can't hear your chain rattle when you switch gears like that? -My bike's getting old. -Don't blame the bike. You just have to adjust your derailleur. -My what? -Your derailleur needs adjusting. Uh, excuse me. -Hi, I'm Shari Kenzie. -Hi. I'm a social media journalist. I'm, um, looking for Otto Anderson. Are you sure you wanna do that? Wow. It's great. That's amazing. You treat it right, it'll treat you right. Here. Keep the set. Thanks, Otto. I can't believe I'm helping you throw crap onto people's lawns. Isn't two jobs enough? I'm saving up for a car. -Yeah? -Yeah. What kind? Volkswagen. Young lady, you're blocking the garage. Mr Anderson? My name is Shari Kenzie. I'm a social media journalist, and I-- What is that? I have an online series called Everyday Heroes. What you did the other day at the train station was amazing. You saved that man's life. You have the wrong guy. No, I don't. I've watched the video at least a dozen times. -It's you. -Video? You haven't seen it? Oh. A commuter recorded what happened on their phone and posted it online. Someone in the comments recognised you. That's how I tracked you down. It's gotten over a million views. A million? A million. Why can't people mind their own business? Because stories like yours are inspiring. If I could just talk to you for a few minutes-- No, now I've got too many things I have to do. I recorded a video message from the man you saved. You should see this. - Um... just pull it up. - Otto! Hi! Good morning. Good morning. Uh... So you ready for another driving lesson? -Now's not a good time. -No? Hello? Hello? Hey, I'm still in here! - I didn't lock you in. - Hello? Turn the knob, open the door. Opened a door before, haven't you? Idiot. Otto! It's me. She's gone. Good. I'm not through with my rounds. "Social media journalist"? What the hell does that even mean? Buncha knotheads pointin' a camera at themselves. I thought you handled it really well. I mean, closing her in your garage. That was, like, excellent strategy. Good job. Otto, also, I was thinking you've done so much for us. -I wanna do something for you too. -I don't need anything. Well, I think you could do with some decent food. Sometimes. No? Those cookies... The what? The "salporanz"? Those are not bad. They're not bad. And, also, I was thinking that I can help you clean out your house and clean out the front hall in your home, and help you pack the coats and shoes you have there of Sonya's. That's not needed. No, but it can help you move on. I don't wanna move on. She's always gonna be with you. -But you're still here. -Ah... That's enough. When my father died, my mother, she stopped living. -She just stopped like she used-- -Stop talking! -Stop it. -Okay! Don't yell at me. Why can't people mind their own business? Idiots. Interrupting me at every turn. The more they babble, the more they drown out the memory of her voice. I don't want to clear Sonya from my life. She was everything. There was nothing before her, and there's nothing after! I'm something. That son of a bitch! Uh-uh. No, no, no. Uh-uh-uh. Uh-uh-uh. Stop right there. You stop that car! Did you leave that gate open? You left that gate open, didn't you? You're the only one who gives a damn. I give a damn about people following the rules. Yes, I know. I know all about you. There's a file on you at the office. It's this thick. I know about your wife. How you blame whatever happened to her on everybody else. You shut up. Don't you say one more word. Take it easy, Otto. Look, I'm not trying to upset you, but you really shouldn't be living alone. I mean, we know more about you than you probably realise, so... Just look after that heart of yours, okay? What do you know about my heart? Hey, what do you know about my heart?! You prying bastard! Otto, Otto. Otto, what's going on? Are you okay? Do you feel okay? You wanna help me, close the gate. Otto. Otto. Otto. Otto. Talk to me, Otto. Please? Otto. Talk to me, Otto. Otto. Otto. Thank you. It'll be cute on you. - No. - -Aw, c'mon. Honey, you look really cute. Give me your hand. The baby's really kicking.

The generator blew and the power is out. What d'ya want? It's freezing. I was hoping you might let me crash on your couch for the night. This is not a hotel. No. I'm sorry. Why can't you go home? My dad kicked me out. There's a sofa you can use. Don't go into the dining room. The ceiling needs repair. It's upstairs in Sonya's old study. So why did he kick you out? Because you're Malcolm now? Yeah, because I'm Malcolm. Because I dress like this. I read too much. I don't like sports. Take your pick. He's embarrassed 'cause I'm trans. Then he's an idiot. This is you. Try not to touch anything. Okay. Well... Good morning. The power's still out so I cooked up the last of the eggs while they're still good. Hope you don't mind. I have to do my rounds. Don't you at least want some coffee first? Yes. There you go. Uh, some eggs? I wouldn't say no. All right. That can... goes in here. Hang that up. Hey, Otto! Making your rounds. You mind if I join you? I need to get my steps in. Okay. -I'm Jimmy. -Malcolm. -Nice to meet you. -Aw, thanks. Yes. Yes. Hey, Otto, if you want to slow down, we can 'cause my beats are up. Yes. Otto, did you hear they're moving Reuben into assisted living this afternoon? Who is? The Dye & Merika guys. My God. They convinced Anita to sell the house. No, they made the deal with Chris. -Chris? He can't do that. -Yeah, he can. After Dye & Merika found out Anita had Parkinson's, they tracked Chris down and-- -Parkinson's? -Yeah. So last year Chris convinced Anita to give him power of attorney in case she got worse. So Dye & Merika made the deal with Chris to buy the house. Those pricks. Wait, Anita found out she had Parkinson's last year? No, that's not right. She would've told Sonya. Sonya would've told me. Well, Anita and Reuben didn't want you and Sonya to know. They said you had enough on your plate as it is. They said that? I need to see everything you ever got from Dye & Merika. Notices, letters. Do you have a copy of the power of attorney? How do you know about that? -Do you have it? -Yes. -Get it. -Yes. And any records of Reuben's condition and yours. Did Jimmy tell you that? Can you get it now? Yes. I've been an idiot. I got so wrapped up in my own troubles, I stopped thinking of anyone else. And I figured they weren't thinking about me. Friends shouldn't do that. So... This isn't easy to say after all this time. But I'm sorry. And I will sort all this out. I need to use your phone. Why can't you use your own? Mine is disconnected at the moment. -Why? -That doesn't matter. I just need to use your phone, okay? You know what? No. -No? -No. You won't tell me why your phone is disconnected? You won't tell me why you need to use my phone? You won't tell me what happened to you in the street yesterday? And then you went inside and you wouldn't even open the door? You scared me, Otto. Do you know how long I was out there? And I didn't know if something had happened to you. Or if something was gonna happen to you. And I'm sorry if I said the wrong thing about Sonya's coats. But I was just trying to help. And you left me out there. So, no. You can't use my phone. You think your life is so hard because everybody's an idiot and you have to do everything on your own, right? Right? But guess what. You can't. No one can. And I think you should just be happy that someone was trying to help you get through a crappy day. Even if they're an idiot. -So... -The real estate bastards are trying to force Anita and Reuben out of their home. That's why I need to use your phone. Okay, fine. Come on. We had never had a vacation. Sonya was six months pregnant. And she wanted to do something special before the baby came. So we booked a trip to Niagara Falls. On the way back, the bus crashed. There'd been a recall on the brake lines, but the company never had them fixed. Sonya was paralyzed... and we lost our son. After three months, she was finally able to come home. But they had started building the new condos and the community centre and the walkways, none of which were designed for people in wheelchairs. The builders could have changed their plans. But the laws weren't in place back then, and they didn't care. I did. -We're putting in a new playground... -I cared. -There's places for people like your wife. -And I was so angry. What does that mean? People like her? What does that mean? - What're you tryin' to say?! - Get off of me! That's when they voted me out as head of the homeowners' association. I wanted to obliterate them all. The builders, and the realtors, and the bus company, the bus driver. I never would have let it go... but for Sonya. Sonya said we had to keep living. That's what I did. I lived for Sonya. Six months ago she passed away. Cancer. I was going to join her. That's why I had them disconnect my phone. But now I think she wants me to keep living. And I have things to do. You're wasting your time, Otto. It's a done deal. Reuben's coming with us. And if you get in our way, I'll have you arrested. -I'm not doing a thing. -Don't you take another step. You are not taking my husband away from me. Anita, please. We're doing this for your own good. What you're doing is trying to take my property. I want Reuben to stay right here for the rest of his life, with me in our home. Okay, but who's gonna take care of Reuben when you're no longer able to? Who's gonna take care of you? Otto? Otto's not in the best health either. Are you, Otto? I'll take care of 'em. -What are you doing? Put that down. -Anita and Reuben are like family to me. I'll take care of them as long as they need. They're not your family. Uh, their son, Chris, has decided they're not fit enough to be on their own, and so what we're doing is-- Excuse me. When was the last time Chris saw his parents? He lives in Japan. They've been estranged for 10 years. Chris would have no idea how his parents are doing, except for what you told him. Okay. And who are you? My name is Shari Kenzie. Social media journalist. -We're streaming live right now. -Uh... All right, all right, shut that camera off. You can't film this. It's a public sidewalk. You told Anita's son, Chris, that she had Parkinson's, but Anita never told anyone about her diagnosis. So how did you know? I'd have to check the records. Mr Anderson over there is something of a local hero. He tells me you know details about his private health records as well. So how are you and your company getting illegal access to the medical records of seniors? Okay, let's go. We're done. We're done. Very nice to meet you. No, you're done. You're done! - Get that goddamn camera out of my face. - Goodbye. -We did it! -Oh, we did! Bye, thank you! I first uploaded Anita and Chris's story an hour ago. Already dozens of people are saying Dye & Merika forced them out of their homes. - That was easy. - Yeah, goodbye. If you have a story, share it with me at Shari_Kenzie. I got it. I got it. Hey, you forgot to shut the gate! You see that? He just rolled right over. Gave up. In our day, the bastards would at least put up a fight. They haven't gotten rid of us yet. Yeah. It does feel pretty good. Doesn't it? Neighbourly neighbours, a thing of the past? Well, I'm here with eyewitnesses Anita and Jimmy to find out more. Jimmy, you mentioned that Anita and Reuben are like family to you. What does that mean, exactly? Well, I have dinner at their house nearly every single night. I know what you're waiting for. You're ready for lunch, aren't you? I know what you want. Whoa. Here we go. You moved into this community recently. -How has that been for you? -It's been beautiful. And your family, to have people there that are-- Yeah. -Otto? -Will you air this in Mexico? Otto! Call an ambulance! -Ms Mendes? You can see him now. -Yes? Yes. Yeah. Hola, Abuelo Otto. Ms Mendes? I'm Dr Ellis. Mr Anderson listed you as next of kin. Yes. Yes, that's correct. Your uncle had a close call. Has he spoken to you about his condition? Mm... No, not really. No. It's called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Basically, his heart is too big. Too big? Mm-hm. Oh, okay. Oh. No, sorry. It's okay. You're really bad at dying, you know that? Ay. Otto, I think it's time. I think it's time. It's time. Oh, uh, I'm a cardiologist. I'll page OB for you. Do something. It's time! All right, ready? All right, picture, everybody! Picture, picture, picture. All right. Ready? Everybody say, "Marco." One, two, three. Marco! Otto! - Hola. Hi! - Hey, Otto. Come in. Everyone, this is our friend Otto. Hi, Otto! Hey, Otto. Sorry, is this about the cars that are in front? No, I brought you something. Otto. Otto. I gave it a fresh coat of paint. I love it. -It's for the baby. -Yes. Thank you. Okay, hold him one second, please. -Why? -To show Tommy. Hold him. Oh, he's gonna cry. Whoa... I'll be right back, bebé. Okay. Tomaso? Hello. There we are. Uh, should I put this thing back in him? There. Oh. Yeah. Okay. Yo soy Abuelo Otto. Okay? Uh, well, let me show you how this works. You don't have to do anything. Easy. Your little head... Now, you just go... like so. Huh? Sonya, this is Abbie and Luna. They have something for you. -Hi, Sonya. -Hi, Sonya. That's, uh, brand-new little Marco there. And Marisol, Tommy. I told you about them. Say, "Hola. Hola, Sonya." She loved pink flowers, girls. You chose well. I like pink too. You see that? - Ready? - Yes. Okay. No. No, no, no. Come on, Otto. All right, Malcolm, check that oil. Check it. And let's see, what does it say? Looks good, right? -If you say so. -Okay. That's it. Okay, now... Here's your manual. Here's your papers. And the key. It's your car. Are you kidding me? Nope. What? Otto! Thank you. Oh, thank you. -Oh, my gosh. -Saved you from a Volkswagen. I have a car! I have a car! - This is your car! - - Are you kidding me? Otto? You got your truck! Oh, my God! Wanna go for a ride? -Let's go for a ride? -That's a nice truck, Otto. Be careful. I like your car, Otto. Yeah? Wait till you see how it rides. It's enormous. This is like Otto's luchador monster truck. Yeah. Do you have any comics? Can we get Swedish éclairs? This is livin'. ♪ Every morning I get up ♪ ♪ Look out my window I get up ♪ Oh, okay. ♪ See the sunshine beating down ♪ ♪ Every morning comes around ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Every morning... ♪ Okay, who's ready for breakfast? Okay. Here we go. Okay? -I can't believe Marco's 3 already. -You're such a big boy. I'll get it, honey. Hey, honey? Eh? Otto hasn't shovelled his walk. Watch your brother. Get the keys. Otto? Otto. Otto. Otto. Yeah. Marisol. Marisol, if you're reading this, don't worry. I haven't done anything stupid. It turns out having a big heart isn't as nice as it sounds. The doctors warned me it would get me in the end, so I planned ahead, that's all. The cat eats tuna twice a day and likes to do his business in private. Please respect that. I would like a funeral. We remember before you this day... But nothing overblown. ...our brother Otto. Just a remembrance of some sort... for those people who thought I pulled my weight. A local hero and good friend of the show is being remembered today. Otto Anderson. Jimmy, would you like to say a few words about Otto? Yeah. Otto, we love you. In your honour, Malcolm and I are doing all of your rounds without fail around lunch and on weekdays. You loom large. My lawyer will give you access to my bank accounts. I never wasted money on crap, so you'll have enough to get the children through school. How'd you do that? And do what you like with the rest. Oh, good boy. Is that a doggie cake? My little monkey-poo. To Otto. The house, and everything in it, is yours, so long as you promise never to sell it to those real estate bastards. And for God's sakes, Marisol... Tommy. ...don't let Tommy drive the Chevy. Come on. Or anyone else, for that matter. I'm trusting it with you alone. Because you are not an idiot.
