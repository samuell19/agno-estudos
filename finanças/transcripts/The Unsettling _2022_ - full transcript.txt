- Yes, I completely understand. Protocol needs to be followed. I don't want to make excuses but I went through a really rough patch earlier in the year. It did set me back a little. You know I always deliver. I understand. I'll pick up rapidly when I return. Okay. Thanks. Idiot. You awake, babe? Almost there. - There you go, sir. Are you coming? - Yeah. Of course. - What are you looking at? - I thought I saw... Don't worry about it. - Cozy, at least. - Don't be silly. - I'm just so happy we made this work. This is going to be so good for us. - I wasn't expecting it to be cold. - Ah, most houses feel odd when they haven't been occupied in a while. - It's clean. - Mm-hm. - And simple. Well, let me know if you discover anything fascinating. - Okay. - I'm going to put these away. - It's not that clean. Babe? - Over here. - Isn't it too dark for you? Much better. - You must be tired. We would be sleeping by now if we were back home. - I feel fine. - Had a good look around? - How did Charles find this place? - He stayed here before. - Did he like it? - I didn't ask. He gave us a good deal on it. I know it's not that glamorous but at least we have some privacy. - It's fine, Kwame. - Why don't you take a nap? And maybe I can make you some tea? - I saw someone outside gawking at us. - Hmm. It must be a curious neighbor. I'm sure they meant well. - I didn't get that impression. - Hmm. Maybe they thought we were invading refugees? Come on. Forget it. I just want us to settle in comfortably. We had a long flight. There's nothing in there. I looked. - I was just curious. - Hmm. Curiosity killed the cat. - What is that supposed to mean? - Nothing, though. - Everything is a joke to you. - Are you nearly done? I have a surprise for you. - I'll be out in a minute. I thought we were going out for dinner? - Oh. We have plenty of going out to do. I thought it would be lovely to have a traditional meal for our first dinner in a new country. - Kenkey? - I also brought some plantains, spinach and dried fish if you want that instead. - Where did you get all this? You brought this with us? You know if they had seen this at the airport they would have sent us right back. - It's from my grandmother. Now, before you get pissed I want to clarify that she practically begged me to bring them and I couldn't refuse her. - It's okay. I wasn't going to say anything terrible. I suppose I can't blame you for being discreet about it. It's not like she would have wanted me to know anyway. She's never liked me. - Of course she likes you. Don't be silly. - Have you noticed the way she looks at me? She obviously disapproves of our marriage. - That is all in your head. - Even what she said to me at our wedding sounded like a curse. - Are you accusing my grandmother of witchcraft? - I'm just saying, she doesn't like me. - I don't want to argue. I can order you whatever you want and then I'll have all the kenkey to myself. - No, it's fine. Let's have your special dinner. I wonder what was in that picture frame. - What's wrong with the food? - Nothing. I'm full. - You barely even touched it. - It's just a bit heavy for me after the flight. - Jesus. I suggested we order, but you said no. - Don't swear, please. That food will keep. - You're right. This empty frame is interesting. Maybe it had a picture in it that the house owner didn't feel comfortable leaving available to strangers. Or maybe it's some sort of modern art. - I don't see what's artistic about an empty picture frame. - You'd be surprised what people call art these days. - I'm positive there was a picture in there. - Well, it is a mystery we will never know. - Did Charles mention who the owner is? - I didn't bother to ask. I didn't think it was relevant. - I think it's a woman. I found a makeup purse in the bathroom. - Who cares? It's not like we will meet them. Beautiful, isn't it? So quiet and peaceful. Stop being silly. I just want to cheer you up. - It's cold out here. I think there are mosquitos. Maybe the battery is dead? - Well-- - "The sensational Mareros is back in town after a long hiatus." It looks interesting. We should check it out. It's nearby. - I thought... Never mind. - You thought what? - We just got here. - Come on. It'll be fun. This is a new start for us, right? Let's be spontaneous. - Babe, come and do the merengue. - It feels like a graveyard. - It is late at night, babe. People are sleeping. This isn't that a crowd. - I'm aware of that, mister smart ass. It just feels really eerie. - It is awfully quiet. - Did you-- What-What was that? - What? - I think someone is at the front door. - Lay back down, babe. It's the squirrels. - Can you go and check? - All right. Who is it? - Who was it? - No one. Oh, come on, babe. - I don't think that sound was from a squirrel. - Okay, who do you think it was? There wasn't anybody out there. What's wrong? Hmm? Are you upset? - I'm feeling a bit tired. That's not funny. Quit being silly. I know you came into the bathroom. - Mommy! - Did you sleep okay? - Okay. - You want to join me for a jog? - I don't think I'm feeling up to it. - Are you sure? - Positive. You go ahead. - Do you want me to get you breakfast while I'm out? Oh, Vivian and Anthony, they're joining us for dinner tonight. They said they want to see us. - Are we going somewhere for dinner? - I thought we can have a nice dinner in the back yard. Vivian is bringing something so I thought you could make that delicious South African dish. What's it called? It escapes my memory. You should be excited. We haven't seen them in years. - I just wish you had told me earlier. - See you soon. Babe, are you home? Hello? Kwame? Abena, stop this nonsense. Whew. - Abena, is that you? What happened? - I don't know. I couldn't control it. - I think I have a first aid kit. Does it hurt terribly? - Yes. It's throbbing. - Let me see. Is this about the food? You can walk me through it, and I'll just do it myself. You're trying to get out of the evening. - What? No. It was... I can't explain it. Let's just forget it. Don't worry about dinner. I can handle it. - You go through two intersections and then the house is on your right. Mm-hm. Uh, it's an older house. Hello? Anthony? Yeah, the reception here is terrible. Text me if you get lost. Yes, I know. GPS can be misleading. Mm-hm. Hello? - Hey! - Hey! - You weren't kidding about the directions. - Yeah. You are looking good! - Thanks! You're looking not so bad yourself. How long has it been? - A while. Vivian! Hey. - Hey, Kwame. - Where's your beautiful wife? - Oh, Abena! Abena? Abena? She's... - Welcome, guys. Sorry, I was freshening up. - Hi, Abena. You look fabulous! - Thank you. - What did you do to your hand? - Nothing. - Hey. - Let me take that for you. - It's just a fruit tart. I got it at the French bakery that opened up near our place. - Lovely. Thank you. - Yeah. - Thanks. - Uganda must be treating you guys well. Who hooked you up with this place? - You remember Charles? - Charles? Yes! Yes! I haven't heard from him in a while. - Really? That's strange considering you live in the same city. - Things are different here. People are busy, and it's easy to lose touch. - You want a tour? - I'd love that. - Oh, your earrings are gorgeous. - Oh, thank you, darling. - Where did you get them? - They were a birthday gift from Anthony. - Lovely. - Why don't you show Vivian around? - Let me try. Hmm. - There's nothing interesting in there anyway. And... bathroom. And our bedroom. And that, my friend, is the grand tour. - Welcome to L.A. You get a hug from Homeland Security? - Just a fist bump, but the Libyans behind us... - Yeah. Crazy times, huh? - Mm-hm. - It's cooler in here than it is outside. - Yeah. - It's cold, actually. Good A/C. - No A/C. I've been freezing since we got here. - Why didn't you guys come stay with us? - Kwame wanted to stay alone. He's calling this a "romantic interlude" but he still wants home-cooked meals. - Good thing Vivian's driving later. You need to send me the recipe. - Babe, can you turn on the heat a little bit? - Heating? It's L.A. It's always summer. - Vivian is cold. - It's okay if it's too much trouble. - No, not at all. How was the tour? - It's nice. Very sparse. The owner must be a minimalist. - Or maybe a bachelor. - Abena thinks it's a spinster. Can I get you something to drink? Wine? - Sounds good. What are you drinking, honey? - Old Fashioned. Want to try some? - No, thanks. - Let me attend to this heating situation. - This is interesting. - What, honey? - Have you noticed this picture frame? - Yeah. - It's a large picture frame with no picture. I think it's odd. - Lazy decorating, if you ask me. What do you think, Vivian? - I think the frame is beautiful. - I see you guys appreciate modern art. - I'm not so sure I see the modern art element here but that's just me. - So, our dinner menu for this evening is a delicious South African dish which my wife will be preparing. She learned it during her stay there. - Lovely! When were you in South Africa? - Last year. I was there for an advanced nursing program. - Clearly, we haven't spoken in far too long. I didn't know you went back to school. - Her hospital even paid for it because they think she's so talented. - Gosh, we haven't been back to South Africa in such a long time. Anthony's work doesn't allow us to travel very much. Too demanding. - We'll make a better plan for vacation this year. - I know, honey. - I only managed to visit Abena once during her stay there. What do you guys think about having dinner in the back yard? - Fantastic idea. What do you think, honey? - Of course. It's warmer outside. - Chilly? Are you still feeling cold? - Well, it's better. - How much does a house like this cost? - $1.5 mil. - Jeez, that is insane. - It's all about location, man. All the houses are in the millions, even the tear-downs. - Wow. Wow. Charles must be making a killing at this job. - Yeah, it's definitely very lucrative if you're renting out million dollar homes. So, does he actually own this house or is he just an agent for some of the people? - I don't know, to be honest. - I get all types, people with post-traumatic stress insomnia, emotional distress, that sort of thing. I usually incorporate hypnosis. - Does it help? - For the most part. It's more effective if the client is mentally and emotionally open to it so it's on a case-by-case basis. - Hm. - You guys have any other plans for the weekend? - Oh, we haven't discussed it yet. We went to a local bar last night. - Was it fun? - It was an empty dive bar. - But there was this Latin singer with an unusual voice. It was very interesting music. Nothing I've heard before. - L.A. breeds all sorts of weird and wonderful musicians. There's a lot to do in this city. Maybe I could steal you one day for a girls' night out? - Definitely. That sounds fun. - So, how's work? - Well, it pays the bills. - These carrots are delicious. Here, try one. - Very tasty. - Yeah. Where'd you get them? - Somewhere nearby. Kwame bought them on his run. - How's your mom and dad? - My mom is okay. My dad suffered a heart attack a few months ago and... it's taken a toll on my mom. - I'm so sorry to hear that. Is he okay? - He's not so good, but-- - Sorry to interrupt, ladies. I'm here for some refills and then I will be out of your way. - You guys need to take it easy on the drinks. - Oh, it is under control. I promise. Mm. Smells divine in here. Mind if I have a taste? Mm. That's a different recipe? It doesn't seem spicy. That can use more spices and maybe a little bit more salt. I thought I got the right recipe. - What the hell, Kwame? - What? I was just trying to help. - Why don't you finish the rest of it? You have it all figured out, right? I told you it's been a while since I made it. You can be such an asshole sometimes. I thought we were here for a break. - I thought we were here to start over. - I don't understand how you expect me to just move past it so quickly. - Where are they? - They're talking. - You mean arguing? - No, don't interrupt. Let them sort it out. - I'll handle dinner. - Wow, that's a huge mansion. - He's got a couple of them, apparently. - It's in Bel Air, one of the most expensive neighborhoods in Los Angeles. It's not as interesting as it appears. Now, how does a regular priest afford a $10 million house? He's a con artist and a crook. - He's upset because he hit on me. - That, too. He used to hit on many of the women in his congregation. He's the reason I stopped going to church. He's an embarrassment to the Christian community. - Why do you hate him so much? - It's not hate. I'm simply addressing the issue. He makes some of us who work hard for a living look bad. Apparently, this guy started this apostolic church movement in Brazil where he was making a killing luring his congregation into performing human sacrifices. Some kind of voodoo bullshit. Some of his followers became very rich overnight. It was like the rags to riches story, but without the hard work part. - It's all just speculation. - Oh, are you defending him now? - Don't be silly. - Abena used to work with this guy at her hospital. Why don't you tell the story, babe? - I don't think it's relevant. - Come on, Abena. - Anthony. - I think we should start a church. It seems like that's where all the money is and maybe you could be our pastor, Anthony. - You know, not all churches are like that. - I'd like to propose a toast. I want to thank you guys for joining us for a wonderful dinner and a delicious meal prepared by my beautiful wife. Let's toast to friendship, love and success. - To friendship, love and success. - Success! Ah, I think I need to go to the men's room. - You remember where it is, right? - I think I can manage to find my way to the men's room. - Anthony, always the comedian. I'm sorry about earlier. Can you forgive me? Can I at least have a smile? - Aw. - You should know better. - I know. It's just that I blame it on this which I firmly believe you should try it. - Don't let him lure you into that. - It's actually very tasty. It'll perk you up. - Are you trying to get me drunk? - It's all in the plan. - Vivian? Is it you? - Hey, did you come looking for me while I was in the bathroom? - No. - I thought I smelled your perfume. - Dirty mind. - Who are you texting? - My other husband. Just responding to some work emails. - You should tell your clients not to bother you on the weekends. - I can't exactly ignore them. - It's amazing how dedicated you are. - Ha! Sure. Till it interferes with your plans. - How are you doing, Abena? Hm? - I'm fine. - I see you've joined the club. Drinking Old Fashioneds now. Did yours talk you into it? - I've had them before, actually. They're quite good. - Be careful. They creep up on you. - Don't listen to him, honey. He's drunk. - Oh, I just remembered something, Anthony. Excuse us, ladies. - Man talk, huh? Kwame... - Are you okay, honey? Hm? You're sweating. - It must be the drink. I told you it creeps up on you. - You should drink some water, babe. Do you want to go lie down? - No. I'm fine. It's probably just jet-lag. - Here. Wipe your face. Huh? - Abena? Abena? Wake up. What happened? Huh? Are you sick? - It's the drink, I'm telling you. - Shut up, Anthony. - Maybe the alcohol was a bit too strong. - No, I'm okay. I'm fine. - Maybe it's time to move inside. It's cold out here anyway. Do you need to go to the hospital? - I don't think so. - Don't worry. It's probably just a combination of... stress and jet-lag, and alcohol. - Jet-lag doesn't make you see things, in my experience. - Maybe we can try hypnosis? It might help you clarify what you're experiencing. Just think about it. No pressure. - Fucking battery. - Hey... - What are you guys up to? You're drunk, honey. - I just want to dance. - To no music? - Are you feeling better? - Just a little headache. - Ah... - Let's do it. - Do what? - I'm ready to try it, Vivian. - I want to try hypnosis on Abena. - Why do you need hypnosis? Do you think that's a good idea? - It's a simple therapeutic technique. It's nothing alarming. You can sit at the dining table and stay quiet or go outside and I'll let you know when I'm done. - We'll cooperate. - Close your eyes. I just want you to focus on your breath... as it comes into your chest and then your belly, and focus on the breath as it leaves your body. Inhale... exhale. You're feeling very relaxed. I'm so sorry, guys. I can't help it. Please continue, Vivian. What? I said I was sorry. - I think we should probably get going. Are you upset? - I'm too tired to sit through this and Vivian can come back tomorrow and do it. - Thank you guys for coming. - Dinner was lovely. Talk soon. - Absolutely. Good to see you, Vivian. - Thanks for having us. I'll come back. - Good night. - Well, that was weird. I mean, it was good to see them, but that was... - Something's not right. Do you think they're okay? - Yeah. Look, most couples go through issues, you know. - We seem to be doing pretty great with very few issues. - We're the exception to the rule. - I'm worried about her. - Look, Abena's a big girl. She can look after herself. - I know. I think it's something more than that. I think I've got to go back and see Abena. - What, now? - Yeah. - Can't you just go in the morning? - I've got to go. You remember what happened to my patient last year. - Look, you've got to stop blaming yourself for that. It wasn't your fault. - You should go and get some sleep. It'll be fine. - Okay. If you need anything, give me a call. - Of course I will. - Love you. - Bye. - This should help with the headache. Snap out of it, please. I can't deal with this right now. - You know you're selfish, right? Was the laughter necessary? - Me, selfish? You can't even disclose to me why you need hypnosis. I thought that you were doing better. Are you crazy like one of Vivian's clients now? - I just miss her so much. - And you think I don't? But we have to move forward, Abena. We can't live in the past. It's been nearly two years. - I'm sorry if I can't just move on. It's like part of my body was ripped away. - You work with the pastor. You went to South Africa. We have taken this trip. What's going to help? Huh? Hypnosis? - I should have never gone to work. - It was an accident. But, of course... it will always be my fault. I thought coming here was going to help us heal. - And how is that working out for you? Because so far, it seems to be all about you. You just brought me to tag along. I have almost no say in what we do. "Abena, we should eat at home. And you should cook a meal. Oh, it's fun and relaxing." What's the point of coming somewhere new just to end up staying indoors? - Didn't we go check out that band last night? - I wouldn't call that going out in a city with lots of amazing things to do. - But it was your choice to go there, not mine. - Don't turn it on me. You haven't expressed interest in going anywhere since we got here. Correct me if I'm wrong, but what happened to going to the beach? It was obviously fake promises, as usual. I heard you on the phone in the car. You didn't make quota. Kwame, I just started this job. - I know where this is going. Hold that thought. Vivian... I thought you guys went home. Too drunk to drive, eh? - Anthony's at home. I came back for Abena. Look, we can hold off on the hypnosis and just talk. It's equally therapeutic. After it happened did you think about consulting someone... like a therapist? - I did counseling through my church. I found things to occupy my time and I thought I had gotten better until we arrived here. And then suddenly, it's like it happened yesterday. Or like it's happening now. I don't feel in control of my mind. I hate it. If you honestly think hypnosis could help... - Tell me... what happened when you came here? - I've been having these dreams. Kwame and I, we're on the beach. And then I hear her calling to me. Kwame runs to help and I walk over to see what's happening. But it's a stranger. A woman, at first. And then... she transforms into this... thing. But I don't think it's a dream. I think it's here in this house. - I need a glass of wine. Do you want a glass of wine? Vivian? Vivian. Vivian. Vivian? - Abena? Abena? Abena?! - Abena, wake up! - Abena, wake up! - Wake up! - Wake up! - Can you hear us? - Babe. - I feel lightheaded. - Vivian. Vivian! Vivian! Hold this on her head. I'm going to call for help. Shit! Anthony, pick up the phone. Anthony, pick up! Pick up the phone. - Abena... Where are you? Oh, I see. This is some kind of hide and seek. I wish I could join you. I know you are in there. Should I come join you? - It's not Kwame. You're not Kwame. I know you're not Kwame. - Abena? Abena? Abena? Abena, help me. I'm scared! - Vivian? - Hello? Hello? Hey, guys? - Anthony... Anthony! Anthony... - Vivian? - Vivian? Help me. Help... me. Help me!
