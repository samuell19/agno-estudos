THIS FILM WAS RESTORED IN 4 K THANKS TO THE SUPPORT OF THE "ARGENTINIAN FILM RESTORATION PLAN". A private car with occupants acting suspiciously, QSL? Negative, sir... it doesn't have a record in our files, QSL? PIZZA, BEER AND SMOKES in condition to give you the news... You don't have to be abandoned! We must fight to win! We must fight to get victory! Seven, twenty six, QSL? That's right, make the math. 9.4 degrees, humidity 48... Looking for a male suspect wearing jeans, long hair. The ministry of home affairs... What's the QTH of such vehicle? I inform you it has been used for kidnapping. The rates were released... the unemployment rate would be around 2 million and 50 thousand... Go, go. Come on! Windows up and lock the doors. You, man... put your hands between your legs and put your head down. No, no, stop! What's going on, man? Nothing's going on! Just give us the money, OK? Don't look at me! Don't. You're mistaken, brother. I don't have dough. I'm not your brother, motherfucker! Give us the cash. - Go! Go! - No, but... - How the fuck do I open this case? - I'm just a worker like you. Worker... and this? You're no worker, you're a businessman or something. I have nothing more! You have a family, right? Do you want to see them again? Yes! Lower the gun! Well, then, hand over the cash, man! Give us the cash! Don't look at me, motherfucker! Or I'll kill you. But, what do you want? Search me, I have nothing... When I find something, I'll whack you. - You'll make me lose my flight. - Flight? Man, forget about your flight. Give me the money or you're dead, asshole. Bu... But... Don't cry, you piece of shit! Just give me the dough! - Pull your pants down, go! - What do you mean the pants? I said put your fucking pants down! He gave you all the money, leave him alone. What do you know about him giving the money! I said shut up, I'll talk to you later. Easy, man, easy. Pull your pants lower! - I'm not from around here, man. - I didn't ask you, asshole! You have to give me the money or I'll kill you and him, too! - Lower the gun, lower it. - Fuck, man. Don't you tell me what I have to do! - What is this? - It's spare change, it's not much dough. What spare change? You won't even keep a token from this! - Man, you need to calm down. - And what is this? - Is this also spare change to you? - I have nothing more. - Move forward. - But, what are you doing? What do you have here? Look at the shit he has! Didn't you say you had nothing more? What the hell... Hey, dude! Are you letting me through or what? No, I fucking won't, you pompous ass. Man, I've been honking for three blocks. I have passengers here! And I don't give a shit about it! Got it, rocket man? - I'm telling you, let us through. - No! - Man, let us through, we're in a hurry. - I'm not talking to you, shitty Cordovan. - What did you say? - That you're a shitty Cordovan, dude. Come outside! Come on! Come here! I'll kick you 'till I break you! - Stop, you son of a bitch. - Come here! - Stop him! Tell him to stop. - Come here! Cordovan, come back here! You motherfucker! - Let's go, let's go. - Go on! Start the car. What are you doing, you idiot? So, your husband left? - Megabon, give me a cigarette. - I ran out of cigarettes. When the others get here, we'll buy some. - No, give me one now. - I told you I don't have any. This Cordovan is crazy, crazy! No... Look... and be thankful I'm not asking you for dough now. So you better teach him good, or everything gets fucked up. - How daring, this guy. - You got anything, man? Yeah, I got some cash. Here, you take it. Cordovan, I don't want to work with this guy anymore. How are you all? Cordovan, we're fucking hungry here. Yeah, man, about time. We've been waiting here, I don't know what the hell you were thinking. Why didn't you bring the pizzas? And that's what you were waiting for? Yes, man, and now you have to go buy them, fools. MÃ¡quina, why didn't you get them yourself? First, I had no money, second... Fuck off! You idiot. Second, I didn't want to. Besides, Sandra is sick, man. You're the sick one, asshole. - Girl, do you want to eat or not? - I do, but I'm not sick. Besides, I want to eat on a table, I don't want to eat here on the floor. No, we can't afford a table. We can afford pizza and beer, standing up. - Man, let's go to Banchero. - What's Banchero? Banchero, man, who invented the cheese fugazza. No, we're not going there! Let's go to Ugi's. Pablo, shall we? Yeah, let's go. - Pablo, here you go. - Sweet. I once met a girl who got turned on by that obelisk. Turned on, how? I don't know... She said it was some kind of penis that captured all the penile waves around the city. That girl was a whore, man. - Whore? We dated for two years. - Exactly. I don't know, man. Erecting a giant dick in the middle of the city? She must come from Buenos Aires. And you Cordovans who don't get in the game? The law. You're having a kid, man. Knew that? Not me, Sandra. Don't play dumb. Dude, how will you name her if it's a girl? - Julia. - Why? - She was an aunt I loved very much. - Cool. - And if he's a boy? - Pablo. Let's go. Cordovan. Dude, can you see a little window on top of the obelisk? Yeah, so? Once I saw these guys coming down from there with a rope. They were three. - Why would they do that? - I don't know! You don't know? They didn't say why? I don't know, man. Surely they were just hanging out. The view from up there must be pretty? Man, these pizzas aren't filling enough. I told you, bro. Banchero, Banchero. You keep talking about your Banchero. Do they fuck you there? - Do you have some money left? - No. - And you? Got any dough? - Not one peso, beast. How come you never have even one peso on you, asshole? I'm unemployed, asshole. Your brain is unemployed, dude. - Who's coming with me? - Where are you going? Around. - No, man, stay. All of us ate already. - I'm still hungry. - But, kid, you're always hungry. - I'm hungry, too. - Frula, are you hungry? - Yeah, man. Then come with me. No? Come on, man! - Weren't you hungry? - Yes, I am. Hi, there, man. What's up, Cripple? What's up, Cordoba? What are you guys doing here? - Nothing... Still playing the viola? - Yeah, working a little. Cripple, I have a pair of shoes for you, they're too small for me, in exchange for pizzas. Don't come make fun of me, at this time of day I am not in the mood. You're scaring the people away. Get lost. People? There's no one around. I'm having a group of people who will listen, from the Sheraton. - A group of assholes would listen to you. - What's wrong, dude? Did you come just to make fun? Why don't you go with your girl? She's doing some other guy over there. Come on, take him with you, go. Get it together. Woman? What woman are you talking about, man? Go away, come on, off you go. You fucking cripple! What the fuck are you doing, dude? You son of a bitch! Stop, stop. - You son of a whore. - Stop, calm down. What are you doing? You're robbing me, motherfucker! Let go, you son of a bitch! - Asshole! - I have it all. Let go! Son of a bitch! You motherfucker. Go away! Fuck off! Come and get us! I'm gonna kill you! I'll get you, son of a bitch... I'll get you and I'll kill you. Son of a bitch! Come on, Sandra, let me help you. What's wrong with you, baby? Can't you see how I look? I'm not saying you should jump. Come on, I'll help. - Stop, baby, you're drunk. - Go, man, do it, do it! Cordoba, I won't put up with this. I'm leaving. Hey, Cordoba! - Go ahead, close it. - OK, OK, I'm closing. Cordoba! Man, an elevator, some stairs, there's got to be something here. - There's a bed in here, take a look. - Man, you're right, a little bed. Besides, I don't think there's an elevator here, dude. Megabon, don't lie down! There may be fleas. - Let me, I'm tired. - Shut up! - I'm just lying here. - Shut up! Hear the water running, dude... Look at these gals, dude. Come check this, Pablo. Man, if there's a bed, there's gotta be some money, too. Come here, Walter, come. Take a look. Let's see. Man, look at these gals! Look a those tits. You know how horny I get with some gals, dude? Stop! What are you doing douche bag? Dude, it's been two months since I last fucked Sandra. You have a nice ass, seriously. - What's that? - A flashlight, idiot, what else? - Where did you get that, dude? - Look at the wine I found, man. Wine, man. - Where did you find it? - Here, dude. Let there be light. Come on, go! - Go up, do you want me to light your way? - No, you go. Hurry up, man, or I'll fuck you from behind, asshole. Calm down, nobody's hurrying us up, Cordovan! I'll fuck you both from behind, then! You can't fuck anybody from behind, Cordovan. Fuck you, Megabon, hurry up. Are you coming or not? No... Hey, stop, Cordovan. You come here. Let him stay down to jerk-off. Come on, man. Looks like we're here. Be careful, don't fall down. Give me your hand, Frula. Hey, Cordovan. Come. - No, no. - You're so bitter, man! Here, Frula, open it. Frula, don't you think it's been enough about Trompa, man? No, I can't stand that idiot, man. His story is too much. - Man, you can't see shit from up here. - Can you see Sandra down there? Idiot, I'm telling you I can't see shit and you ask me that. We have to rob a big one. We're working our butts off for the same old pizzas. I don't know, man, I'm not coming back to the trains. They're privatized and all. I prefer Trompa. See, Cordovan, you know what? We have to become independent. Without us that guy is nothing. He can't work, nothing. We have to go to strike. We must ask him for a raise. We have to send that man to fuck off. I can see little Sandra, man. Come, Pablo. You can see from here. I'm all right, man. Yeah, let him go to hell. Sandra! Sandra! - Cripple, let her go! - What is it, Cordovan? Tell him to let go! Cripple, motherfucker, come here! Megabon! Megabon, go out! They're taking Sandra! Let me go! Stop, you're not hitting Frula. - Give me a smoke. - I don't have any. Man, would you share a cig? Got a light? Thanks. 90 DAYS WITHOUT PAYMENT Everybody to the ground! - Give me a cigarette, Pablo. - I don't have any. - Would you share a puff with me? - No. - Man, then give me the bedside table. - Knock it off. Always in a bad mood? - What's up, Cordoba? - Let's see. - What are you watching? - A very good movie. Sit down and watch it. You'll notice something. - Dud, does Sandra have smokes? - No. Come, little Sandra, hey. Watch how they take all the money. That's how it's done. - Do you have a cigarette? - No. Man, where's Frula? Frula thinks the same, no more taxi jobs. - I know, but where is he? - He got mad and left. He says yesterday you made up the scandal so you could hit him. Watch, Cordova. We have to hit something big, pay attention. I know, man, hit big... - But, what the fuck do you want to do? - You won't realize... Watch. - Megabon, did you see my cigarettes? - No, and you? Cordoba, Frula has his eyes on something. Now I get why you keep bothering me about that asshole. He says he has a friend named Ruben, who can get cars and guns. Besides, he at the front. And says he takes less than the boss. - Another taxi driver? - Taxi driver? You know Ruben, he's Santiago's brother. - Let's talk later, man. - OK, we'll talk. Easy on that door! Guys, see if you can lower the volume on that TV... What are you looking for, Sandrita? It's can't be possible that I left my cigarettes here and now they're gone. I'm sure it was Megabon... Megabon, give back Sandra her smokes! - I don't have them. - All three of you, as bad as the other. Sure it was Frula. He got mad yesterday and left because I hit him. All four of you, then. I almost killed myself yesterday trying to help you. Really? You don't say. I did... but then Pablo didn't let me down. Just like the other day on the train. The train thing has nothing to do with this... that was because of Alberto. Look, I'm sick of your bullshit and your stories. Baby, it's OK that you feel a little insulted... but don't cross the line, OK? Tacky Cordovan. The only thing you do is get drunk. I'm not the only one who drinks. Frula and Megabon drink more. You can't go down the block without Pablo looking after you... I can't ask you for a favor! If I send you to the drugstore you go and get drunk with those bums. It was Jose's birthday. You're a stupid son of a bitch. - What did you say? - What you heard! - Are you talking to me? - You. Megabon, give me 50 cents. - Is still not over? - That's another one. Megabon, I asked you something. - What? - Lend me 50 cents for the bus. I don't have anything. How did the other one end? All of them get killed except for the old man. - Stop playing dumb and give me 50 cents. - Girl, you're annoying. Pay me back. All but him, the guy who acts in all the war movies. - So, to your old man's? - Yes. Can't you see your mouth is bigger than your head? - I thought you didn't stand him. - I don't. You're two-faced. When I can't stand someone, I don't even acknowledge them. Tell me one thing, who's gonna support the child? You can't even take care of yourself, dickhead. Don't call me a dickhead, you hear me? Don't point fingers at me, baby. There it is... - Help me up? - No, I won't help you at all. - Would you give me a ride to the bridge? - No, I can't. If you want me back, get a job like all people do. Fucking asshole... What is it? - Don't play smart... - Excuse me? Don't play smart, OK? Don't sweat it, many crazy people out there these days... What did you say? Nothing, man. We're wondering about your reaction. Nothing wrong with me, dude. Ask him, who's been touching my ass for an hour. What? You've been touching my ass, I wasn't born yesterday. What are you talking about? - I'm not a faggot, understand? - What's wrong with you? - What's wrong with me? - What's wrong with you? Dude, stop! Stop it! - What's wrong with you! - Stop! Stop! Man, stop it. Stop it, you two! Stop it! You're grown ups. We're all Argentinean. Stop bothering each other. Man, calm down. We're here to get a job, man, not to fight. Besides, you're making all this drama, and you... you've been touching my crotch for half an hour. - Man, what are you saying? - Stop, dude! Stop! - What are you talking about? - What's wrong with you, asshole! Here's the thief! Son of a bitch! Get him! So you've been robbing people around? They are the burglars, dude! Get them! Somebody get them! Son of a bitch! Take this. Stop them! - You OK, dude? - Yeah, man, go. You get the tickets, Megabon. Three 50's. We made it, Pablito. - Pablo, what is it? - What's happening to this kid? - What is it? - Nothing, he gets sick in enclosed spaces. - Open up the windows. - This kid has to go to a hospital. No, this is about the closed space. Give him some air and he'll get better. Pablo! Hey, dude, come on! Mind your words in front of others. - Why? - You're gonna end up in jail. Look at your eyes. - What about them? - Red. Don't break anything. I'm just connecting, that's all. What are you doing with your arm like that? They told me to keep it like that, but I think it's ready. - How much dough did we get? - Nothing, man. How much is nothing? I don't know, 40 bucks. And we still have to pay for this. - Pay what? This is public. - You still have to pay. Leave that! That's for peeing, don't you know that? Leave it and go wash your hands. Don't touch your face, anything. Go wash. I'm fucked up, man. You're fucked up... this one with his red eyes, cracked... me, at the hospital with asthma. Stop complaining about the 40 bucks. We have to get out there and rob, not act like rats. - Where did you get that? - Around. Over there. - Where "over there", idiot? - There, with that old man. All that running and in the end we never get good cash. - You're kind of crippled. - You don't get to say, get it? What are you doing, Cordoba? - Don't you see I'm having a smoke, idiot? - Go smoke outside. - What are you, a pussy? - No man, I just had an asthma attack. - You're such a girl. - Fuck you, man, go smoke outside. - And you, move over, I'm uncomfortable. - What? Nurse! - Is it any good? - Not good, is awful. - Give me some space, I'm tired. - OK. Pablo, let's do the big job you talked about. Sure, Cordovan! You think I'm messing with you, man? This is for our own good, understand? When you get out of here, go look for Frula. And tell him to bring his friend with the guns. - Why don't you tell him? - No, I can't, I have to go now. Where to? To get Sandra? No, not at all. Sandra can go fuck herself. Hello? - Sandra? - Yes. - What are you doing? - Who is this? What do you mean, "Who is this", baby? What are you doing? - I wanted to tell you I got a job. - Is that right? - Yes. - What is it? A job, it's complicated, I'll explain later. Girl, I have a surprise for you. Want me to bring it over? - Now? - Yes, now. - Are you far from here? - No, I'm right here. If you look out the window you'll see me. Don Cacho. - Your old man's always friendly? - Is getting worse every day. Close your eyes. What happened to your voice? Nothing, I went to get a job yesterday and got a cold air. - Close your eyes. - Come on, Cordoba. Close your eyes! Here. Why are you bringing me cotton? I was asking around, and... They said you are going to start dripping. You might need it. Do you want to go for a walk? - OK. - Come. - How are you? Fine? - Fine. - And what's the job about? - Taxi driver. You don't know how to drive, Cordoba. So what? I'll learn. I'll get in and learn. What is it? You don't like my job? I like any job. But I want you to promise me one thing. - Yeah, I'll promise you anything. - No, just one thing. Promise me that if this job doesn't work out you're gonna get another one, but no more stealing. - So? - So what? Don't play dumb. Do you promise or not? Yeah, but you don't understand a damn how things are going on. No, what I don't understand is you not taking care of me. What the hell am I going to do if one of these days you go to jail? Hey, but that's not gonna happen. Don't worry about it, OK? All right? - You know what I've been thinking? - What? - The two of us should move to Uruguay. - Three of us. Yes, us three. Do you want to touch my belly? - Touch it? - Yes, come. Do you feel it? One of these is not working well, but I don't know which one. - What car do you have? - A 1971 Ford Fairlaine. An old thing, dude. It's the only one I could get out of the garage or the old man would go crazy. Cordoba, here's the deal, man. - Ruben is asking for 50. - Fifty bucks? Fifty, man, half of what we make. Dude, the last time was less. Yes, but last time was no car and two guns. This has to be like this, dude: We get in, and we get the dough fast. No fooling around or else the cops come and lock us up. Last time we almost went to jail because we were fooling around. - OK? - This has to be hit and run, man, at once. Have you thought about something? I have a place, it's a party. It's at Eleven, but it has to be done by one, or else it would all be wrong? - What's that? - A very fancy restaurant... where the rich and famous go. Hey, dude... do you know if the blond girl goes there? The one with the boobs from hell. The Pradon gal. I think she does. Dude, we want to go where the money is, understand? Take it easy and listen to me. I'm telling you the fee is 50 pesos. If there is a 50 pesos fee, it means there is a lot of people with money. - What fee? - Cordoba, what you pay for your seat. You pay 50 bucks and in the end you take them back? No, idiot, if you want a good dinner, you must pay good money. Classy people go there, famous people. Do you know the place or what? - No, but Ruben told me about it. - Then shut your ass, dude! Stop. It is like this: I get there and I go. You know what I'm saying? Five minutes and that's it. Today's Friday and the place is packed. Cordoba, don't you think it's a lot for so little money? Getting cold feet, Pablo? What are you doing mother fucker? Shit for brains! You idiot, what did you do? It went off, dude. It went off. He wanted to kill me, dude! If we wanted to kill you, the four of us would do it! What the hell do you want! Sandra brought this guy! Please, dude, focus! Stop wasting time! This isn't a game! We can't go anywhere like this! You're an asshole, brother! It went off, man, I swear. I didn't mean to. - My tooth fell off. - Tooth? What tooth? - The tooth, I lost it. - OK, everybody, look for the tooth. This idiot... What kind of tooth you have? What's it like? It's a silver little thing that cost me a lot. It has to be over here. And you, asshole, you're not getting a piece, is that clear? Is that clear? Yes, yes. - You know how to drive? - I do. - Are we there yet? - Patience, it takes time. Otherwise, things turn out shitty. Dude, are you sure famous people go to that bar? First, it's not a bar, it's a restaurant. And second, yes, I'm sure. But, man, do the fancy gals go there? - Who? - Man, the ones who are fine. - Who? - He's talking about the Pradon gal. How do you know he's talking about her? How do I know? He's always teasing about her. - And who is that? - The blonde one, you dumb! On the day I hit the big bucks, first thing I'll do is pay for a night with that chick. By the time you hit the big bucks, you're gonna be an old jerk-off. And that chick will be a mummy. So what, idiot? I'll pay for her surgery. Nowadays, 50-year-old gals look like 15-year-old chicks. That's the one. OK, well, let's do it. Easy, man, calm down. This has to be coordinated. Yes, Cordovan, don't be hasty. Easy. These two are talking about coordinating? What is this? Cops and robbers? Megabon, you're gonna be the buzzer. As soon as we get out of the restaurant, you get the wheel and start driving. - You sure know how to drive? - Yes, I told you. This place is dead. Nobody's here today. How can you tell? The drapes are down. - There are no cars. - It's got nothing to do with anything. Rich people come in taxi or limousine. Man, don't chicken out. The folks are in there. You just have to dive in. Man, are you sure you gave me the piece that works? Or everything's fucked up. Here's the thing: By this time, the cash register must be loaded. We go in, nice and easy. You cover me and I go straight to the register. Just like that. - And what's the place like? - Like a sausage. Megabon, if you see the cops, get in there and let us know. If the cops come, I run like hell. And then I go out and shoot you the fuck up. - Easy, easy. - OK, let's go. I'll let you know if something happens. Let's go. - Dude, this door's not working. - OK, stop complaining, get out this way. Look! I've seen her on TV! Man, I told you rich people come here. Yes, I think is one of the wealthy chicks. I think she's the Callejon girl. No, Callejon has a bigger ass, dude. What do you know? Maybe she got surgery. OK, stop the nonsense. Megabon, get down. No, let me stay here, I'm comfortable. No, get down or you'll fall asleep. Come on. Let's go. Where are we, dude? There's no one here. She may not be from TV but the chick's good looking. Ruben... faggot. Who was it? Fucking shit, who was it? I don't know, man! Let's get out of here! What the hell, dude? Go, Megabon, go! Start the car! Shut up! I don't know what's going on. Go, dude, start! Didn't you know how to drive? Move over, man! - Go, Ruben! They're coming! - Shut up! I'm going! Calm down! You're not even a good buzzer, dude... You can't do absolutely anything! You don't drive! You don't do shit! The problem was you taking us to that lousy place! But I didn't want to get in! Cordovan wanted to stay! That's bullshit, man! You were desperate for the money! We didn't have to do this today, dude! I'm not working with you ever again! You're crazy, Frula! Never again! And, Megabon, you're not even a good buzzer! - Go fuck your sister! - What about my sister, asshole? You know what? Just... Get it together, guys! - What happened? - This shitty car. Just what we needed! He's just so calm about it! Open the hood, man. Open the hood! Are you deaf? We're always working with morons, dude... This is number one, dude. What happened? Look where this friend of yours is gonna get us, dude. - We can kill him! - Stop, man. Let's see what he can do. - This asshole's gonna play a trick on us. - Shush, man, calm down. Do you think he's with Ruben? With him? What are you talking about? I've known this man for a long time! - So, man? What's with the cop? - Calm down, everything is all right. - You sure? - Yes, let's talk about something else. - Start the engine. - Yes, officer. - I don't know, man. - Shut up, everything is fine. You're all set. The manifold was loose. Thank you very much, officer. - May I see your registration? - Yes, of course! Driver's license? You won't believe me, I didn't bring it along. You could give me something, since I gave you a hand and all. - Like how much, officer? - Like something. OK, wait a second. - I have 120. - I have 70. - Give me everything. - 50, man. - How much you want? - How much you got? - No, you tell me how much you want. - A hundred. - 50 bucks? - OK. Be careful. Don't step on it. - I don't know, man. Let's go for a beer. - Yes, at once, man. - Did you see? She was the Callejon gal. - Don't forget to jerk off tonight. No, seriously, man. The other day I read in a magazine she liked old guys. Here, man. - I'm off, man. - No, dude, stay a little longer. No, I've had it with you. That place you took us was shit, man. Let's do something else. - We'll do it some other day. - No, dude, let's do it today. What are you talking about? The policeman saw the car. - Dude, what about the dough? - Cordovan has the dough. - Me? What are you talking about? - I just gave it to you. You gave me 40 pesos, I thought it was for me. You thought wrong, man. Today's a shitty day, period. Do you think we're stupid? Cut the crap, man. I have expenses, I have to pay for the gasoline. Besides, the tooth was about 200. Hey, come back here! Give us the rest. - Stop, man, calm down, dude. - Fuck you, man. - Keep quiet. - Fucker! You brought a piece? Come back, you son of a bitch! I'll get you, motherfucker! Hey, Cordovan! - Didn't you say he was your friend? - Yes, man. Your friend is a major son of a bitch, you know that? Actually, he is, dude. - Maybe you're in on this with him? - What? What's wrong with you, asshole? Dude! Cut it out! You're not going to fight each other. Why do you get angry like that? - You fucking asshole! - You, too, man. Stop teasing him. You know what? Let's clear up a little. Are you in? Go grab a beer somewhere? - OK. Let's go. - Let's go, dude. You get mad at the other one and take it all out on him? Stop, Cordovan! - What's your name? - Miriam. - And you? - Me? Frula... and you? - Me? Majo. - Majo? I'm 25-year-old. Hey! Man, can you call Miguel? You're an idiot, man. You never follow my game. Instead of playing along, you're a dumb ass! I'm Cordoba, he knows me. Tell him it's me calling. - Hi. - Hello. - What's your name? - Malena. There is Miguelito, we'll get in now. Me? Megabon. - You're kind of bitter, aren't you? - Depends on the person. Miguel is not here. If you want in, you have to pay. What do you mean? I just saw him in there. Leave me alone, kid. I said he's not here. Does he think he's the big thing? Go on and call him. - Do you think I'm stupid, asshole? - Fuck off, kid. - Tell that pompous ass to come out. - Fuck off. - You chicken shit! - Fuck off! You shitty pimp! Come here, big mouth! Cordovan, cut it out, fucker! Stop this! Come on. Stop this shit, sit down. It pisses me off, dude. That fucking asshole. He got a job and now he thinks he's the big shit. But he will pay. I know how to get those sons of bitches. - Can you get us in? - What do you say? - You want to? - Yeah, OK. The problem is we're going to need a Ruben, dude... With guns and a car. No, dude, I don't want more bosses. I'm tired of being shit. Two bosses shit on us, do you want to get shit again? Are you stupid, dude? What's on our head? I can drive, but where do we get the pieces? We have to get them somewhere. What up, dude? Are we going in or not? Frula, don't come bothering, we're talking, here. Man, you have to give me my part, dude. Give you what? Man, we don't have dough and you want us to pay you? Come on, dude. I have some bitches there. You know what a bitch is? Fuck off. This kid just won't grow up. You know what? I know where we can get everything we need. What do you think, this is a game? You come, you go, you disappear. That's not how it goes. Boss, you know I have the Sandra issue. She's pregnant, remember? I don't know why is it your issue. You're not even sure if the baby is yours. A hot dog, man. Like that is not going to work. Thank you. You relax, boss, there will be no mistakes. Besides, we need the money, or we wouldn't be talking to you. The money. - Bye, Paco. - Bye, boss. Thank you... Here, Cordoba. All right... I'm gonna give you some bucks. But only if you behave, and don't fuck up at all. Especially you, Cordovan. Don't worry about me, I'm not going to shoot this time. No, forget about it. No more guns for you. And how are we supposed to do the job? With the fingers? That's not my problem. I'll see you at Libertador and Callao... in half hour. No more shit from you, is that clear? Boss, can I ask you something? How do you do to take them all to the same place? This guy is the real deal, dude. I'll get the son of a bitch. Why is he honking the horn? - You calm down, and nothing happens here. - Hey! You drive and eyes forward. Give me your wallet, lady. - What are you doing? - I'm robbing you. Give me the earrings, the rings, everything. Man, eyes on the front. Come on, lady. Take everything off. I'm not going to hurt you, just give me everything. - You're making me nervous, man. Just go. - OK, OK, I'm going. - Take good care of this, please. - Lady, don't fuck with me. - Make a turn. - What? You heard me, I know what I'm doing. Go on and turn here. - Close your eyes and do what I say. - What are you going to do to me? Nothing! Just close your eyes. Now turn over here. - What? - Stop here, do it. What the fuck are you doing? - Knock him out! - If I do we're going to hell! Knock him out! If I let go he'll kill you! Break! Break! Come, Pablo, help me so we can go. Help me move the boss, dude, so we can leave! How are we going if you don't drive? Got a better idea? Her, man. She drives. Did you get high? Old lady... you're going to help us. You're crazy if you think I'm helping you. Fucking old woman! You better help here or we'll end you! Stop it, Cordovan, let me. Look, lady... if you help us out I promise nothing happens to you. But if the police gets here, you're gonna get it bad, understand? So you better help us if you want things to turn out well. Hurry up, old lady! It's been a long time since I drove, I don't know if I remember how to do it. Well, you better remember quickly, go... Make a turn here and take Panamericana. - OK, but you lead the way. - OK, go. What are you going to do to that poor man? That's none of your business, old woman. Poor man? He's a major son of a bitch. - You know him? - Plenty. Look at that. I've been warned about the taxi drivers in the capital. Where are you from, old lady? I'm from Cordoba, although it may not seem like it. Just like you. - Do you think about going back? - I was going back. When I took the taxi I was going to the airport. - What you have is asthma, did you know? - Yes. Search the purse... there's a little blue thing. It may help you. - Ventolin. - You know how to use it? - Yes. - Good. Nice old lady. Give me the keys. - Where are the guns? - Where are the pieces, mother fucker. Where are the guns? Where are the guns? Where do you keep them? Look, Cordovan! We found them! He thought we wouldn't. Look, son of a bitch, we found them! Dude, what do we do with the old lady? What do you want to do? Old lady, move over, I'm driving. Fucking cab drivers. They're all the same. They wander around or they rob you. Back in Cordoba they're not like this, they're good people. Lady, did you miss your flight? No, it's not for another half hour. Are you sure you can drive? Tell me if I do something wrong. Old lady, say hi to the Cordovan people! Good morning, this is the Electric Radio Command. What were you doing, baby? Any longer and I would've thrown a brick. I was sleeping, that's why I didn't hear you. - Don't shush me! - Baby. - "" My balls. - Shut up, asshole. - What's that? - Nothing, I fell. - Did he hit you again? - I fell, don't you listen? When you live with your old man, you keep falling and falling. Shitty house... Tonight is the last night you sleep here. Tomorrow you're coming with me. - Did you get the dough? - I have everything. What? You don't want to come with me? It's not that. I've had the bags ready for two days. - So? - Nothing. I think I'm afraid. Afraid of what? I don't know, that something may go wrong. Nothing will go wrong... Everything is fine. Look, let's do this: Seize the night, get your stuff ready, and tomorrow morning wait for me by the ferry with the tickets and all, OK? What if I go with you now? I can't right now, I have to finish something. Didn't you say everything was ready? Almost everything. I have to finish some things. Here. The money for the tickets. - Where did you get this? - From the taxi. - Cordoba, don't fuck with me. - No. - I need you... we need you. - Do you? Of course, baby. What were you thinking? OK, Sandrita. At the ferry at 7:00. Yes. - I'm off, bye. - Bye. Hey, Sandra... Yeah? Do you think I can be a good dad? Yes, my love. There's the Cordovan, come on, Frula. You, too. Come. Cordovan where have you been? We've been waiting for half an hour. - What can I say? I was late. - That's all you have to say to me? What do you want me to say, asshole? Come here. - Dude, who has my piece? - Me. Cover me, Frula. Dude, have you checked things out? It looks calm, dude... That dude's gonna be a problem. OK, like we agreed. - Come. - What is it? - You're not in. - Why not? You're high, bro. High? I was never this sober in my life, bro. My uncle owns the place, you'll see how I call him now. - Get going. - This moron won't let me in. Give me the gun, I'm going in. - No, dude, today I want to use it. - Don't start your crap, give it to me. You guys are always fucking me up. Here. What are you doing, asshole? Do you want to get shot? OK, get in. It's my turn. - Give me the dough. - What dough? The one Cordovan gave you. Cordovan didn't give me anything. - And you didn't ask for it? - No. And how were you getting inside? I'm here to steal, I don't have to pay anything|. - You remind me of an actress. - Who? - The Callejon... do you know her? - Doesn't matter, I like that you flip out. Easy, don't move or I'll shoot you! - Not a lot of cash. - But it won't be expensive. Bye, baby. What are you doing? Hurry up and don't touch anything. You, too, or I'll break your skull. Woman, don't touch anything because there's people watching and I get nervous. - Q.T.H., reporting a possible car theft. - Go ahead, sir. It's a taxi, plates: Charlie, first, eight, sixth. I'm sorry, officer. I want to tell you about a woman who tried to rob me. Wait a second. I'm working. Don't play hero, or I'll whack your head. "To serve and protect"... and when they tried to rob me? When you have to do something, you don't. I can't believe this. Look, if she's molesting you, bring her. But stop bothering or I'll lock you up. Get out of there! - Is everything OK? - Come here, son of a bitch! He's got a gun! Don't shoot! Go, Cordovan! Go! Son of a bitch! Where the fuck is Megabon? Megabon, Pablo! - Frula! - Freeze! Fuck! Everybody, up! Stay on the floor and I'll kill you! Nobody on the floor! Man, get out of the car! Fuck off! Fuck off! Run! Run! Go, brother, get in. - Where are you meeting? - Where what? Where are you meeting Sandra? - How do you know? - I know. To the harbor, the ferry. How do you feel, Cordovan? I'm fucking blazing, dude. Here, press with this, hard. I thought you were pissed about me and Sandra leaving. It pisses me off more than you think. Fuck, it's the cops! Come, Cordovan, get down! Get down. Last call for boarding the 7:00 ship to Montevideo. Cover the wound, OK? You're leaving. Hear me, asshole? - No, I stay here. - You are leaving! Shut up! Cordovan! Go man, cover your wound. Fuck off. About time. I thought you weren't coming? What happened? What's wrong, Cordoba? Nothing, I think you'll have to leave alone. Why, what happened? I have to do a couple of things, but everything is fine. I'll meet you later at your old woman's. Did you keep your promise? No. But everything is OK. Please, I'm asking you to go. Do it for the baby. Please, I'm asking you. Go, you'll miss the ship. Take this, go. Hurry up, the boat is leaving now. Turn around slowly! We're getting closer and you better not move or you're dead, man. Do you hear me, man? Get close and check if he has a gun. - Take him, take him inside. - I can't... I think he's dead. - Mobile 127 to command... - 201. Comrades of public force on their way, sir. Mobile 127 to command... 127 go ahead, channel free. Sir, about the last alert, in regard to the suspect who escaped from the blue Fiat mobile. - QSL, that's it? - That's it QSL, Sir. I can confirm he was found at the port sector at the QTH ferry dock... It's a male NN, apparently dead due from a bullet wound... QSL? So this officer asks for ideal staff to verify the death of the suspect, QSL? QSL. Ambulance is sent. When you're certain, please communicate it by any means. Affirmative, sir. Also, dispatch the coroner for the removal of other NN suspect killed in the shooting that took place earlier. QSL. Understood. Subtitle translation by Tania Martinez
