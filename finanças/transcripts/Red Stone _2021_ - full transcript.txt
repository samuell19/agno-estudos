Yeah. You're late, Danny. On my way. Did you bring it? Of course I fucking brought it. Good, 'cause this doesn't go without the package. Fuck me. - I want liver and onions. - Mr. Bernadette, we need to go back to our room now for lunch. Well, I don't like meatloaf, and I just want liver and onions, and a side of green beans. - I know. - I don't like it. - Let's go. - I don't. I'm so sorry, sir. So you were saying Debi's no longer going to be staying in the Villa Deluxes? May I ask why? I just can't afford it. So please if we could move her back to a basic room. Unfortunately, I cannot negotiate that with anyone other than Dean or Nancy Boon. He's dead. Died last week in a car wreck, Nancy too, and their two children, my nephews. Today's the funeral. I'm terribly sorry for your loss, Mr. Boon. Horrible, just horrible. Did you inform your mother? She doesn't know. Shit, she won't know shit. She doesn't even know where she is. She thinks I'm a fucking milkman from 1956, and you ask me if I informed her. Excuse me. I'll be taking over her finances. I'll be back this afternoon to bring her to, to bring her to the funeral. Look, I know exactly what I did. Not proud of it, it's just she was a real pretty girl I knew from school, and we were alone, and no one was even here. So I am sorry but it's not like we did anything that bad, we just made out. But my dad used to tell me that, "If you see a girl that's pretty and you think you got a shot well, you take it 'cause you may not get another one." Kid, I don't give a shit if you got off in my store, but check this out. Right there, see that right there! That's what you call stealing. And I tell you what, I'm gonna press charges on your white trash ass. Hey, hey, you little shit! You son of a bitch. You little shit, come back here! I'm calling the cops! Hold up, son. Motley Adams, it's a little early in the day for you to be loitering my streets. Just walking to my friends. Does your momma know you drink now? What? No. No, she don't know or no, you don't drink? No, I don't drink. Then why are you stealing beer? Ed's gonna file a complaint. I don't know what you're talking about. Well, your brother taught you well. Sheriff, we got ourselves a 10-29V over on Deli street. Possibly the same car in the robbery yesterday. I'll be talking to you, Mot. Say hi to your brother for me and that pretty momma of yours too. Get in the fucking truck. - Danny, I didn't- - Let's go. Do anything, I promise. Oh, it's like that huh, D? Where are we going? We gotta leave. Leave? You remember Uncle George? No. Shit, right, you ain't never met. He lives in Oklahoma, and that's where we're going. Oklahoma? You got a fucking hearing problem? Yes, Oklahoma. Wait, what the hell? No, I'm not going to- - Shut up, Mot! Uh, what the fuck you, Danny, no! Shut the fuck up! Fuck you, no, I'm not going! What the fuck is there for us in Oklahoma, man? What about Mom? Mot, I don't have time to argue with you. Just please, please listen to me, I'm in trouble. I'm in trouble. It would be best for Mom if we both leave. Fuck! Fuck! Mot, get in the back, and stay down, now! I said get down! I don't wanna go under the blankets. Whatever happens you stay quiet. Don't you dare make a noise. If this should go bad, get back home, and you grab Daddy's urn and Mom, and you leave. What's going on? Shut up, Mot! Just shut up. Hutch. Dan the Man Adams. Been trying to call you. You don't answer your phone. This fuckin' lighter sucks. Let's go talk to the boss. Why don't you kill it. Hang tight. Boss. Morning, Danny. Morning, Boss. Beautiful, ain't it? Huh? I was up with my grandson this morning watching that gorgeous sunrise. You met him, right? Yes, sir, of course. Real handsome one is what you should be saying. Real handsome one, yes, sir. Yeah. It's those moments you realize how lucky you are to be alive, just to exist. You know when you live as long as I have and you got through as much shit as a man like me has to go through you start to soak up all the simple things in life like sunrises, and coffee, and all that which makes the world what it is, which is beautiful. You know I was thinking this morning while I was sipping my coffee that I am lucky but I worked my ass off to get here. I put things in place to start something special and not just for me for my family, for others, for you. Everyone benefits. You like this truck you got here? Yes, sir, I do very much. I heard from an old friend of mine there are dark forces abound, someone talking, saying things that could bring down this whole big beautiful world. No, sir, I ain't said nothing to anyone. They tried, I didn't tell them anything. Well, that may be true, Danny, but sometimes these dark forces they don't just want ya saying things, no, no, sometimes they want you to bring them something, like evidence. Maybe that's what they want. You've been good to me, Mr. Haywood, me and my family. I wouldn't do anything like that, I owe you. Jed. My friends call me Jed. You're my friend, right, Danny? Yes, sir. - Jed. - Yes, Jed, I'm your friend, but I'm also not a rat. Hmm, maybe it's that friend of yours you brought on last month, that uh, colored boy, Paul. Neither of us would talk or take anything from you. We just, they scared us is all. They had us in a tight spot, and that's, that's why I haven't been calling you back, that's why. Look... I swear on my fuckin' life. Hutch, get Hank on the phone. Crush the truck, and burn the body. Just can't get any good help these days, huh, Boss? No, this is serious, make this disappear. If they already got to him chances are they got to others. This never happened. I told you when you brought Danny in, I saw he was weak. Should have my fucking head examined bringing in a kid. Boss, he wasn't a kid, he was a man who made his own choices. He knew better not to get involved or he didn't have the balls. Know what I mean? Get this piece of shit out of here. Okay, Boss. Shh. Fucking gross. See what you can do with it. Some fancy duds there, Hutch. Shut the fuck up. Just saying yellow is your color. Hey, you want any of these blankets? Fuck no. Some of these are pretty nice. It's gonna cost a little extra, Hutch. What the fuck did you say? It's gonna cost you a little extra. And why's that? Hutch. Who the fuck is that? Fuck! Hey. We got a problem. Hey. I got somethin' for you, call me. What are you doing? Yeah. Da, da, da, do. Here we go, you handsome little devil. Yes, you are. Yes, you are. Oh, yes. Grandpa loves you. I love you so much. You get your little legs going. You get them little legs going. Yes, you do, yes, you do. Are we gonna eat breakfast? Oh, yeah, oh, oh, oh, you getting fussy, you getting fussy. You want some breakfast? How about some pancakes? I need to lose this baby weight, Daddy. Baby weight? There you go. Oh, you're getting tired. I got him. Boon, I am so sorry for your loss. You need anything, anything at all, you just ask. Uh, congratulations on your grandson. Much appreciated. How long they staying? Uh, not sure. Still gotta find Colt's Daddy. After I kill him they'll probably move in permanent. I like having my grandson around. Thinking maybe he'll get me to give up all this outlawing and go legit. Nothing like a newborn baby to melt your heart. Looks like they're almost done. Look, uh, I'd love to help but today's just not a good day. Look, Boon, I know you're up to your neck in it. My little brother Samson drowned in the Red River 1977, 1977. damn near destroyed our family. Samson was a little shit I'll give you that, there were times I wanted to smother him myself, but he was my little brother. Left a hole in my heart that's still there. Wouldn't even ask today being what today is, but I have to, it's awfully important. I need you. Walk with me. What did he do? Took something from me. Had to let him go. What did he take? Ruby worth a pretty penny. After the Houston job he slipped it out of the stash. Hutch found out a day too late. Turns out what we believe to be Danny's younger brother was witness to us firing him. He see everything? Pretty sure he did. Need the ruby and the kid brought back here today. Why don't you just send Hutch? Needs to be dealt with in a delicate manner. Hutch has a temper, and well, can't just kill the kid, need to bring him back here, just talk to him, that's all. Talk? Sure. A little coming to Jesus meeting. Look the funeral's this evening, I just. Not many get to walk away, Boon. We go way back, you're a friend. Hey, there. Need a ride? You a perv? 'Cause I'll beat your ass. No. No, I'm not. What you got there? Okay, listen to me, son, I need to talk to you about Danny. You should come with me. Yeah. Fucking rice every day. Excuse me. Hey, look, man, if you have a issue take it up with the manager. I don't have an issue, I have a question. All right, shoot, what's your question? I'm looking for a kid who works for you, Motley Adams. Motley Adams doesn't work here anymore. His pay stub says he worked here last week. All right, he got fired this morning, okay. You know where I can find him? Who the hell are you, man? What, are you a cop or something? Do I look like a cop? Where can I find him? Huh? You might wanna try his brother or some kid he hangs out with. Kid? Yeah, he's name is uh, Paul or something like that. Appreciate it. Kid's fast, I'm old, what can I say? Can't argue with that. You got a lead on where he's going? Yeah, you said, Danny's got a friend, right? Yeah, uh, a black kid, Paul. That's right. Yeah, I'll find him. I'll find 'em both. Your brother tell you anything? - No. - Hey, Mot, don't lie to me, bro. All right, this shit could fuck me up too. If Jed took out Danny I mean, and that dude's on some old school Dixie mafia type shit. Man, those motherfuckers believe in covering their steps. They know you saw it, they're gonna come for you. What's your plan? He, he, he really fucked, he uh, he really fucked up. Say what? Dan, Danny took something from him. What was it? Goddammit, Mot, you gotta tell me! It's just uh, it's just uh, it's a red stone or something. Diamond, that's the shit he was talking about. Yeah, he said, he was in some shit yesterday. Damn, most be worth a fortune. You got it? I don't know, man. You sure your brother ain't tell you where it's at? Yeah, man, no. You're scared right now, huh? I just can't believe he's gone. He didn't say much. Yeah, we're on the corner of Fifth and 20. Yeah, just tell him where to meet me, man. - I don't care- - Who are you talking to? Hey, yo, get the fuck back in there, man! Who are you talking to, Paul? I'm trying to save our ass, aight? Now get back inside. Yeah, just. Where you going? I'm leaving. I don't think that's such a good idea, little man. You need to stay here where it's safe. I don't think it's safe. I said, you're staying here. Goddammit, Mot, don't make me whip your ass, man. Where's it at? Come on now. Whoa, little man. What the fuck you gonna do with that, huh? You gonna shoot me? We family. Your brother was, was my brother. My brother trusted you. Hey, I'm just trying to set - this straight, Mot. - You fucking liar! They killed Danny, and they're gonna kill me too. No one ever points a fucking gun in my face! Motley, you're coming with me. Why don't you just lower that gun? No one needs to get hurt. You think I'm a stupid kid? You're gonna kill me. If he wanted you dead you'd be dead already. He just wants the ruby. What about my brother, huh? I get it. I understand more than you know. There's only one way out of here. Mot! The feds. What did you say? Danny was snitching to the feds. Yeah, a dude rolled up in here earlier asking questions about Danny. He said, "They coming to take him and all you motherfuckers down, man!" Sheriff. Neighbor said, "They saw a kid at the front door, a few minutes later gunshots." Paul Global's place. Who? Tough little shit runs with Danny Adams. That figures. Got a nine millimeter buried in the wall, blood splatter on the counter. Cici's Nail Spa, how can I help you? Emily. Danny. No, it's uh, it's Mot. Oh, you sound like your brother. What's up? Uh, uh, Emily, I. Yeah, Mot, can you hurry it up please, I'm at work. Um, Emily, I'm, I'm, I'm in trouble, and uh, I, and I, and I need you to help. What's wrong, have you talked to Danny? No, I, I can't talk to him right now, Emily. I just, he just. Okay, all right, I, I think I know what this is about. Just come here and we'll talk about it, all right. No, no, I, I can't. Then meet me at the house. No. Then where do you wanna meet? You know uh, you know on the crossroads where uh, you and Danny first, well, you know you gave him a BJ for the first time? Okay, yes, stop. - Do you? - Yes. Please, Emily. All right, Mot, meet you there. Motley Adams, hello, there again. Why don't you get in the car? Fucking bitch ratted me out. No, no, no, your brother ratted first. Now go on get in here where it's safe. Okay, okay, I get it, I understand, me being a stranger and all. I'm Agent Tanner, FBI. Come on, son, get in here where it's safe. Come on, Motley, just get in the car. There you go. What time are you getting off, sweetheart? Nine. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Come back. - Okay. - Take you into the night. - Okay. Please, please, please. Oh, mercy. Boss. There you go. Oh, yeah. How you like them pancakes? Hey, don't mind if I do. I spilled my beer. Yeah, what's up? Boss. If you're calling me I'm assuming you don't have the kid. Is that a fair assumption? Is this phone secure? What kind of question is that? It's a pretty damn important one. Yes, of course. Why didn't you tell me the kid was a rat? Well, Boon, maybe I was trying to be considerate of your situation. You dealing with your brother and all, I figured you didn't have to worry about that. Maybe it's just none of your business. Anything else you left out? Source says there's a fed in town. Danny was uh, talking to him. Now what do you got for me? I met Paul. I had to let him go. Send me the address. I'll have someone go clean it up. I took care of it. Well, good. Glad to see you still got some initiative. A lot to clean up today. You in the sticks or are you in town? Almost in town. Okay, come by the Bullfrog. Why? 'Cause I fucking said so, Boon. Drop the shit attitude. I want you to take Hutch. No, no, no, I got this. I'll have the kid and the ruby within the hour, and then you can have your little talk with him, right. You know what? How about you do me a favor and pretend like I'm still the fucking boss at least for one more day? Come get Hutch, then you two go grab the kid. You got it? The baby. Yes, he's just an asshole. Yes, he is. Put it out. Let's go. So what now? I know where he's going. Well, how's that? You've been looking for him since this morning. He's running out of places to go in this town, and he's a kid. Yeah. Well, he's a little shit is what he is, just like his stupid brother. Fucking stupid. The kid's not stupid. He's angry, he's scared, but he's not stupid. Well, let's make this quick. You got some place to be? No, but you do. Don't you? Don't you got a funeral to go to, right? After you. Shitty motel room. Sure you're not a perv? Yeah, well, I gotta stay off the grid, son. Local law enforcement doesn't even know I'm here and I intend to keep it that way. Besides you're not my type, I like 'em blonde and double D's. Now the last time I saw your brother was early this morning, he was supposed to finalize a deal with me, but I guess he had a change of heart. Then I track you down, and uh. Do you know where your brother's at, Motley? You need to listen to me very carefully 'cause the man your brother works for is extremely dangerous. He won't give two thoughts to killing you, your mom, Emily, so if you know something, anything at all about your brother now would be a good time to tell me. Jed Haywood ran a crew in Mississippi back in '89, '90, that was the first time I'd ever heard of him. You know, in my line of work sometimes you see things that, that stick with you, things you can't shake. I remember I was stationed there for a few weeks working a case, hell, I can't even remember what the case was, but I do remember the morning we went to Lester Bowman's apartment. You see Lester worked with Jed, and he saw something that made him turn, so we went to get him that morning. I, I just remember all the blood, the, the smell. Lester, his mom, his twin sisters, even their cat. Here. So uh, son, you can protect your family, just tell me what happened. Danny's dead. They killed him. No. Damn, son, I'm, I'm sorry. Uh. Yeah, this morning he was gonna pick me up, and uh, and we, and then we were leaving, and then uh, if he never picked me up he, he probably would be alive. Hey, it's okay. It's okay. Look, you'll be all right. Listen to me, son, what I'm about to ask you it's very important for you to answer me and tell me the truth. Did you see your brother die? Motley, I can get you and your mom safe but you gotta tell me now. And Emily? Yes, and Emily too. Did you see Jed Haywood kill your brother? See you tomorrow. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you doing? Let go of me! - Shut the fuck up! - Let go of me! Let go of me! What are you doing? Help! Help, help! Please help! Help me! What do you want? What did uh, Danny tell the feds, sweetheart? What? What? I don't know what you're talking about. Hey. Look at me. Don't make me shoot you, huh. Bam, bam. I'm gonna puke. Emily, look at me. Jesus, let's get this thing going for fuck's sake. Don't listen to him. I know you're scared but we're not gonna hurt you. I need you to answer me two things, did you talk to the fed? Is Danny dead? Did you kill him? Danny's not dead. We hid him from the feds. They weren't gonna help him, and they're not gonna help Motley, they're just using him for something. He's staying with Mot. He's meeting him, he's with him. Do you know where? He said, "He's staying here until he gets Danny." Tell Danny, I'm sorry I talked to them. What? She told us everything we needed to know. She was with the fed earlier, we could of used her for more information, you sloppy son of a bitch. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that little fuck, he's with the fed right now. Besides the boss says, "To clean it all up." You know you perplex me, Boon, last week you and me were sinking a body in the river, and today looks like you're questioning your whole fucking life. Yeah. Hi, Mr. Boon. - This is Lisa with Lakeside. - Shit. I'm just calling to let you know that we have your mom all ready. What? Clean her up. What are you talking about? Serious? Okay. You got it, Boss. Don't smoke in my car. Fuck that shit! He wants us to take out the fed. You know what that means. It's gonna go to hell in a hand basket for sure. I ain't never killed a fed, you? Put that thing out. With all due respect I'm gonna smoke this fuckin' cigarette, and if you don't like it then we can squabble it out when all this is done and over with. Is that okay? I don't like you being nervous. And I'm not fuckin' nervous, all right. I'm not. Just excited is all. Let's go. What you got there? It's uh, my father's ashes. Really? You uh, think I'll be able to keep 'em, you know if me and my mom get in witness protection? Yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah, this is Agent Tanner. Yeah, can you put me through to Lloyd please? No, no, no, that's okay. Um, just tell him to call me back at uh, 555-8320, room 114. Where you going? I'll be back. Just gonna see if I can get a signal outside. I have the ruby. What ruby, son? The ruby Danny stole for you. The whole reason he's dead. And you got it on you? Well, that's good of you, son. When I get back we'll take a look at it. Come on, you piece of shit. Ah, there we go. Fuck me! God! Fuck! Goddammit! Fuck. Howdy, partner. You stupid son of a bitch! I'm FBI, you know what that fucking means? Yeah, means you're overpaid. Hey, you need to keep quiet! Shut the fuck up, Granny! Go inside! Little fuck! I'm not gonna hurt you. Finally! Let's do him, and let's get. Bunch of pissed off people here. You don't do as he says he will kill you. Let's get him out of here. Fuck that. Let's do him now, and let's go. We can't. We need the ruby, and he knows where it's at. The boss don't give a shit about the ruby anymore. I do. Don't you? Let's take him down to the lake. I'll make him talk. So what you and me split the ruby? That's right. Let's go, kid. Why are you doing this? Your fucking brother, he was a coward. Snitched. He wasn't no snitch! We were running away. We, we weren't even gonna do anything to y'all. He was gonna sell that rock, - and we woulda just- - Your brother- - Disappeared. - Was stupid! No, he wasn't. You know what it takes to move a ruby like that over here, yeah? Greedy little shit. Give me. - Fuck. - Fuck you! Where's it at goddammit? What the fuck is this shit? Haven't you ever seen an urn before? For ashes. Fuck. You mean dead peoples ashes? It's gross. Hey, show some respect. What the fuck is this? You know you're right, you know the kid ain't all that stupid. I mean throwing it in this dead man's ashes I mean god, that's fuckin' brilliant, brilliant! Fucking unbelievable. That was easy. It's your turn. Been dumping all the bodies today. Let's go. Come on, let's go. Kneel down. Please don't, please, man. Please don't, please. Come on already. Let's get the fuck out of here. Why'd you do that? I didn't like him. What do I do now? I don't know, kid. Everything's so fucked up. Did you get along with your brother? I guess. I mean, I, he was just more like a dad most of the time. Yeah, mine too. I wonder what he'd tell me to do now. You got a mom right? Yeah. Go to her. Jesus, Motley. I've been trying to call your brother all day. Oh, my god, honey, get in. His younger brother's is here, and says, "He ain't seen him all day." Now they live together, and that ain't normal. My son is missing goddammit! He's gonna come talk to you. I want you to tell him about that Paul, and what he done to your face. We'll track Danny down. In the meantime you can stay with me. Ah, shit. Did you have any idea the FBI was in town? Do now. He should of called for backup. Sheriff Quincy, come in. Quincy, over. We have a personal request for you. Well, as much as that warms the cockles of my heart, I'm not the menu item of the day. It's Sally Adams. She's demanding to talk to you. So yeah, you heard about two, two rounds. What's with the casing? Always make time for a lady. Good evening, Ms. Adams. It's Mrs. Adams. And what are you gonna do about this bastard? I love to hear you talk, Sally, even when I don't know what you're talking about. That son of a bitch assaulted my son. All right, son, why don't you just come with me for a bit. Uh, seems like you're up to your neck in trouble today. 10-4. Danny's dead, Sheriff. Dead? How? Jed Haywood shot him. I saw it. I'm sorry, son. I truly am. Howdy. I got somethin' of interest to you.

Why don't you enlighten me. The fed. And the kid? No. That one got away. All right, well, he didn't get far. What do you mean he didn't get far? Don't worry about it.

Even? The whole debt, all of it, like it never happened. I like that arrangement. Hmm, I bet you do. Just gonna need to clear up some things with the boy's mother, but that won't be any trouble for you. Oh, it best not. Hey, Stix. Hey, do me a favor. Handle this after I'm gone. I don't have the stomach for this shit. I'll call Oliver in Shreveport, let him know our debt's settled. You may not be able to visit the casinos for a while though. Pleasure doing business with you.
