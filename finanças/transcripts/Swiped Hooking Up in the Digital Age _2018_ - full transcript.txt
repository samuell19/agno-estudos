At least that way nobody knows if I'm talking to them except for me and him. Female Interviewer: What do you mean the boys you're not supposed to talk to? Well, I am in a committed relationship with a man I love, and I really, really, really love him, but there's times where I've seen him Snapping girls he's not supposed to, or being on Tinder on the third page of his phone, so I'm like, "You know..." He tells me to move past it, we'll move past it, but I'm like, "I'm going to do the same thing." I've seen some of the conversations people have on Tinder, and it's like, I'm a bold and brash man, but I'm not that bold. It works for some people some of the time, they're like, "Hey, wanna suck my dick?" and they're like, "Yeah, of course. Come over." Dick pics on Instagram, got a lot of private DMs where people show me their penis and they're like, "I would love to ride you." I'm like... ( chatter ) It's pretty fast, you know, it's like people are trying to just hook up. - Man: How long? - I don't know. An hour, in some cases. An exchange of, like, six messages. ( man mock screams ) I think women are just as justified-- and should do this if they so choose-- - to use it in the same way. - Woman: That's true, and I agree with you completely, but the playing field has not been even, and it has really never been even. Man: What does it mean to be even? No one's forcing anyone to do what they don't want to, ya know? Man: It's social coercion.

There is a major breakthrough headed to American consumers. It's the iPhone-- an iPod, a cell phone, and portable Internet, all in a little lightweight package. The announcement has set off a major stir, and it could change the way you live. I am a child of the Internet. I started going online at, you know, age ten. My mom tells me that I started playing on the computer when I was three, and I've basically been on it ever since. I got my first phone when I was in eighth grade, and that completely influenced the way I interacted with girls. People get phones in middle school, so nudes start when you get a cell phone. Well, I used to do, like, a video call, on Skype or AIM, where it was just like both of us masturbating. I was 14 or 15 whenever Grindr came out, and I remember getting it and then lying about my age. I think I got a Tinder, like, my senior year in high school. I think I started one of those in high school, I was probably, like, 16. I do remember when you used to call people on the phone, like if you had a crush on someone, I think it was seventh grade, eighth grade. Just shoot the shit over the phone. And then you'd like hang up and you kind of feel that warm kind of fuzzy feeling. That probably doesn't happen anymore. I think if you called someone these days, you'd probably get labeled a psychopath. ( chatter ) Man: So we've really seen two major transitions since the evolution of social monogamy, some 4 to 4.4 million years ago. The first major transition was the rise of the Agricultural Revolution, 10 to 15,000 years ago. And the second major transition, I think, has been the rise of the Internet. And with the rise of the Internet, we are in evolutionarily unprecedented waters. We are experiencing a time that people can engage with each other, and particularly around issues of romance and sex, in ways that are totally novel. Now, that's not to say that we're not going to activate ancient biological parts of our behavior as we use the Internet and as we use technology to engage, but what it does suggest is that as a platform it is totally novel, it is totally unprecedented. If a girl is, like, very distinctly attractive, then that's a swipe right. If there are three girls and some of them are moderately attractive, then you go through and see who's who. Usually what'll happen is, I'll go through, and if I see a girl that I think is really attractive, swipe right, and if we match, then I go through and then I look at their profile, because you can't really send a chat-up line without anything to go off of. Let me show you, 'cause I don't know what this girl really looks like. She's got this kind of ambiguous profile. - Female Interviewer: She's 18? - Is she? Well, I'm 22. They all blend together at some point. - Hey. - Hi! - How are you? - Good, how are you? - Good. Glad you made it. - Sorry, traffic was a bitch. Yeah, it's a bad time. Do you want coffee? Sure. Where do you work? I work at an Italian restaurant. - Nice. - I'm a waitress. Yeah. I had three dogs growing up, and a bunch of cats and chickens and cows and goats. I lived on a farm. Totally, yeah. That makes sense. - Yeah, yeah. - Oh, man, I, um-- So whenever I'm in a new class and it's like, "What's your fun fact?" My fun fact is always that I'm related to Pocahontas-- - What?! - Yeah. But that's an aside. The other one is that I helped birth a goat on a farm once, and they named the goat after me. That's very cool. Tell me about your puppy. - Her name is Maya. - Nice. Named after Maya Angelou. That's what I was gonna guess. Yeah. Do you play any instruments or do any art, or... No, I think that-- this is gonna sound super-pretentious and lame-- but I think I'm, like, an artist, I just don't make a lot of art. So I have to go meet my friends, but I really want to do this again. - Yeah, for sure. - Excellent. Hey, I'll text you. Thanks for meeting me. - Yeah, oh, thank you. - I had a good time. - I'll talk to you soon. - Yeah, talk to you soon. Bye. Daniel: Hey, dude, what are you doing? If you just had dates where you go and you, like, the conversation's good, but you know it's not gonna go anywhere, it was kinda like that. Like a friendly date. Like, you know that, like, you're looking for an "in" to progress the conversation into something more intimate or, like, sexual or something, and it just never really happened. I think you take Tinder a lot differently than other people, based on the first interaction being at a coffee house, instead of your house or, "Hey, meet me at this alley." - Open the door for her. - Yeah, exactly. Yeah, that is indicative of a different intention, definitely. Definitely. 'Cause, Eli, I think most of your Tinder dates - take place in the-- - Get physical real quick. - in the home. - Yeah. We evolved in the context of small groups where, say, ranging from 50 to 150 individuals. In small group living, with limited geographical mobility, you would have only encountered perhaps a few dozen potential mates in your entire lifetime. So what's weird is that we take this small-group mating psychology, where the number of potential mates is very limited, and transplant it to the modern world where we have thousands and thousands of potential mates that we can keep swiping through, and it triggers this short-term mating psychology in a way that never would have been triggered ancestrally. I have a funny perspective on it, because we used to be roommates. And really, the funny part was, it was just out of the blue, there was never any discussion of it, but it would just be a completely normal Tuesday night at 9:00 p.m., and there'd be a knock at the door and I'd answer the door, and it would be a girl I'd never seen before. And Eli would be like, "Oh, this is my friend. Here we go." So it was very casual, and I always-- Yeah, I remember that. It was all of September. Every single day, I'd be on Tinder, maybe like 10, 20 swipes a day. It's all the numbers game. So like once a week, pretty much on a Tuesday night, 'cause I remember my Wednesday class, always being so happy in that class. ( all laughing ) Woman: I have always wanted to, you know, have that super-cute romantic thing where, like, I'm at a bookstore, and this really cute stranger bumps into me and I'm like, "Oh, my God, I'm so sorry." And we have this really sweet, simple exchange, and then we part ways, then we come back together later. And, um, I feel like that doesn't really... it doesn't really happen anymore. I think what's so refreshing about it is just that someone would put themselves out there. In person, I think there's a vulnerability that people use social media to hide behind now and not have to do that in-person interaction where they can be rejected. And he did that, which... I think is so much more attractive. Cheyenne: It's also oddly flattering then, as opposed to-- 'cause I had a Tinder for two days, and I got a lot of hits in that time, but it was people just being like, "Hey, what's up, you wanna hang out tonight?" And I'm like, "Uh, I don't know who you are." You can't completely know a person when all you know of them is behind a screen. - Right. - As much as you want to think that you know about them, you don't know their habits, you don't know all those tiny little things, the nuances. And the thing about that is, you get to choose what you share. I'm very aware of the sort of pressure and the need to, like, be manicured and beautiful and have, like, a uniform Instagram feed that people will want to follow and pay attention to. I'm constantly haunted by FOMO. I can easily fall into rabbit holes where I'll spend hours just scrolling through blogs that have these pictures of beautiful, beautiful women that I'm never gonna be, and these houses and these clothes and these vacations that I'm never gonna have. I don't have the greatest self-esteem, which is something I've been trying to work on, which is another reason why I've been trying to sort of step back from spending so much time online. OK, swipe right. OK. Sexually provocative, showing breasts, cleavage... ...doing the duck lip shot. Because you see the picture, it tends to swamp all the other information in the past you did find out-- you knew about the person's education, you spent some time with the person, so you found out about his personality, is he emotionally stable, is this person dependable, how intelligent are they, how worldly are they? And now, with the dating apps, physical appearance overwhelms all that other information and takes on a disproportionately large role, I think, in mating. When we look at dating apps and we see the pictures that people are posting, the ways they're presenting themselves, what's very interesting is that the men tend to present themselves in very stereotypically male ways-- as providers, as fishing, as hunting, as they're up on a mountain, or they're puffing their chests, they look like they're cut, they have these perfect bodies. Whereas women tend to present themselves in more sexual ways. And this goes back to the basics. You know, the old Barbie and Ken culture. One of the worst accounts are the guys looking for the "swolemates." Woman: Oh! I hate the "swolemate" fucking profile. - Oh, my God! - Kim: Oh, my God, I love that! I just want to know, guys are out fishing, and they're like, "I just caught this big-ass trout. Bro, will you take a photo of me with this fish?" "I really need it for my Tinder profile. Can you help me out, bro?" Buss: Breasts, friendliness, breasts, breasts and friendliness, you get the pucker... Yeah, because sex sells. Sex always sells. Go back to anything ever, and sex always fuckin' sells. And I hate it. I hate it. I hate it. And I also hate the fact that we live in this world now where everything and so much of what you are is so dependent on how you look. And, like, I hate-- I'm getting really emotional about this. It's, like, I hate... ( sniffles ) Sorry. What's up, guys. Today I'm gonna be rating people on their hotness. We'll call it "How Hot?" Ha ha! Seven. Fuckin' ten. Yeah, eight. Like, a five. - Eight point five. - Men: Whoa! Man: That's like a bootleg Ariana Grande. ( men laughing ) For Corey, we got nine, for Madison Beer, we got six point five. Man 1: Bro, what's heavier-- her or the couch? Man 2: Oh, my God. Fuckin' ten. Ten! That's one hot-looking girl. So, if there's an opportunity to see women as body parts, or sexual objects, instead of as whole human beings, that opportunity will be taken. And I would say that the whole setup, the whole structure, the whole architecture of dating apps that depend on split-second decisions of "Are you hot or not?" is one of the ways that that is being exploited. What was Facemash, and it is still up and running? Mark Zuckerberg: No, Congressman. Facemash was a prank website that I launched in college, in my dorm room... Silicon Valley, you've gotta understand that a lot of the companies are started by boys-- they're not men, they're boys. Right? And one of the reasons for that is because they all go to the same schools together, Stanford or Harvard or whatever it is, right? And they all live in the boys' dorms, and they sit around on their computers, nerdin' out, and they say, "Wouldn't it be cool if you had this thing where you could do this thing?" And then something inevitably ends up becoming a company, and it's all the boys, the bros, that go and build these apps together, these sites together. And that's predominantly why it is the way it is. ( chatter ) Man: We were looking for different areas that had disruption available. Places that hadn't jumped into the mobile market so well. We were very focused on mobile-first, mobile-only, and we saw the dating market as one of those things. The dating industry was extremely shunned upon in the young, hip, millennial college market. If you looked at any of those other dating services, you would only really use them if you were... I don't want to say "desperate," but almost desperate, right? The idea of a one-click sign-on, which was a natural outgrowth of mobile phones and social networks, was the idea that you can take contacts that already exists for a user, so, their Facebook profile already exists, they can just plug that in, their location is already being fed out by the GPS on their mobile phone, their friend networks are already mapped out by Facebook, and so it was a lot easier to just click a button, we know everything we need to know about you already, and we can start introducing you to the right people instantly. And it became so easy, it was like, "Why wouldn't you do it?" I wrote the original application, the iPhone application, and I also came up with the swipe. The swipe mechanic really was the mechanic that worked for a mobile generation who had short attention spans, was always on their 3-1/2 inch screens, and, yeah, I think it worked. Badeen: We have 1.5 billion swipes a day. A long time ago, in the early days, I think I had figured out if the average swipe or something was, I don't know, like an inch or something, I can't remember how many times you could wrap around the earth with the number of swipes. And that was a long time ago, so we might be on our way to Mars now or something, I'm not sure. Wolfe Herd: I'll never forget the very first time I really took Tinder to a university. I landed on the SMU campus, I went into the sorority houses, and I basically got up on those tables, stood up on a chair, screamed over hundreds of girls eating dinner, and pretty much imposed Tinder onto every single phone. And then I ran as fast as I could with my, you know, fun, enthusiastic girlfriends, two or three of them, and we went into the frat houses. And we had already put the women on the app, right? So we went into the frat houses, and we said, "Guys! Attention! Listen up!" It was really hard to get that attention during feeding time, right, at the frat house, because this is the chapter meeting, so it's dinnertime, and we basically said, you know, "Every... every Kappa, every Pi Phi, every Theta, they're on this app and they're waiting for you to match with them. Download it! Download it! Download it!" Woman: Plainfield is exactly how it sounds, just, like, a lot of plain fields. It was very hard growing up here as, like, a black girl, because it's such a predominantly white town, and it's such a small town. Like, me and my sister were probably two of the only ones when we first started going to public school in Plainfield. I was boy crazy in high school, but none of 'em, like-- they were all intimidated by me. I really thought I would never actually date, ever. I probably used every dating app ever made, except for, like, Grindr, and that's because I'm straight. I remember when I was like 21, I was bored one summer and I wanted to try OkCupid, 'cause I lived at home, didn't have a car, I was like, "The hell else am I supposed to do?" Might as well just, like, work a dating app, it'll be fun." Woman: What was your name again? Everybody-- I'm not telling you my name. It's the best name! You have to say it. OK, fine. I don't care. She told me this, like, forever ago. My name was Ms. Berry on there. Yeah, 'cause it was like right when I cut my hair, and I was feeling my self. I had somebody send me a 14-page message of just vulgarity, I can't even say what was said on it. Mostly, I don't remember, but something about farting down somebody's throat. On dating sites, it gets overly sexualized sometimes, just because people will automatically just want to have sex with you. All the guys on there, they're not looking for shit but hookups. And quick that-night hookups. Like if they want to schedule a date, it's probably that night, and they're probably gonna try to have sex with you that night. Here's how you get treated as a black woman when you're on a dating site. Either they don't want to fuck with you because you're black, I don't know why that freaks so many people out, or, "You're so exotic 'cause you're black. I never fucked a black girl before." Like they never seen a black woman before. They say "no blacks, no fats," no, like-- just like that. It's exactly like that. If you're chubby, they be like, "No fat women, no blacks, no Latinos, only whites. Only 18 to 25." I feel like I've-- I can't be myself or I don't want to, like, let them into who I really am, because I don't trust them. And I just don't want to get, like, my emotions played with and crushed, so it's better to keep it out of it, because they're not worth it. Unless they are. I think that guys are way more harsh than they've ever been before. I think they think they deserve perfect tens, and they are not even a ten themselves. That's what I'm sayin'. And that's what's really messed up. Bree: Women are like that, too. Not nearly as much. I feel like they're more critical and they give you unrealistic expectations, because you got the bombshell bra on, face full of makeup, the weave or the wigs or some shit, yeah, and when all that comes off, then once they see the natural you, then they're not even attracted to you anymore. Bree: I feel for guys, like, the social media, the dating sites like Tinder and OkCupid, it's like a catalogue for them, because you have all these girls, hundreds of millions of girls, you have different pictures to choose from, they can just go through possibilities. ( electric guitar playing ) Kyle: So I went on Tinder about a year ago. And it became, like, an easy thing, I'm just like, I'll lay in bed, I'll wake up, psht, psht, psht.. It's like a little mini-adrenaline rush every time you do it. Common symptom with a lot of the girls I went on dates with was, I was the rebound guy. So if I went on a date, it would come out to a couple of weeks later where they'd either ghost me or they would just be like, "Oh, well, this happened, and I'm in love with that guy, and I just broke up with my boyfriend." And once that happened, then they would go away. ( electric guitar playing ) Kyle: So after that I kinda wised up to the fact that this might be, like, a thing. So in the course of my Tinder messaging, I might have 20 different text messages going on, and each one of those you kind of like keep following. And that's the thing that comes into multi-messaging because some women could do it to you, or you do it to some women. I think I deleted it. And then I redownloaded it, because I was feeling lonely. And, uh, and that's when it kinda, like that phrase "When it rains, it pours"? It got to the point where I might have this one friends-with-benefits over here, and then I'd go on a date with that girl, and develop another friends-with-benefits with that girl, and then all of a sudden it became, like, "This girl's Monday, that gir-- Wait. No. I'll switch that around," and figuring out my schedule for all these different women. There was one bar in particular that I would bring some of these women, I knew the bartender, and he'd be, like, "Hey, is this a date tonight?" It was like, "Yeah." He's like, "Same girl?" I'm like, "Not exactly." I would find myself walking, bumping into people, I'm just like, "Right, right, left, right." It's like a little video game. Gamification is turning an experience that is not a game into a game, so giving it all the elements of a game, things like points that say, "You have done this well." Like when you're playing a slot machine, the machine will tell you when you've won with ringing bells and flashing lights, and a lot of the apps we use now have - ( app beeping ) - elements of that built in. Even when they aren't really about games. We have some of these almost game-like elements where you almost feel like you're being rewarded, it kind of works like a slot machine. Or you're-- there's one... You're excited to see who the next person is, or, hopefully, you're even excited to see "Did I get the match?" and get that "It's a match" screen. That's a nice little rush. You get a match on Tinder and your screen just pops. It's this huge visual stimulation. Super-bizarre. And that's gotta be intentional. Like, it feels good. - ( app beeping ) - Kyle: Ooh. Hey now. I had several classes in college where we learned about this, from my business management courses to psych courses, I think, if I remember, it's called the Variable Ratio-- or Intermittent Reward Schedule or something like that, where it is-- it's the... having unpredictable, yet frequent, rewards is the best way to motivate somebody to keep moving forward. There's a very famous experiment run in the early 1970s with some white pigeons, and the pigeons learned to peck a little light, and when they pecked, they got food. And so these pigeons live in a box and they just keep pecking the light and they get food. But the experimenter had a couple of different ways of rewarding them. So some of them, every ten pecks, they got a certain number of food pellets, and then they ate, and others, every ten pecks, sometimes they got food, and sometimes they didn't. It turns out that the pigeons that gambled, that effectively pecked but may not get a reward, they were the ones who were much more engaged. Even to the point where they weren't hungry anymore, they'd peck because it was just fun to play the game. So in the same sense, these apps that give you this kind of variable feedback rather than consistent predictable feedback, they have this built-in mechanism for being addictive in the same way that a gambling device is addictive. Man: There is a good example of how you can move from the pigeon to the human case, because one of the schedules which is very effective with rats or pigeons is what we call the Variable Ratio Schedule, and that is at the heart of all gambling devices and has the same effect. A pigeon can become a pathological gambler just as a person can. Woman: "It's a match." It's like hitting the jackpot. Then you can do more, then you unlock the ability to message them. - Woman 2: It's true. - And it feels good. Or you can go back and test your luck again. - Woman: Yeah, it's true! - Man, it's so weird, 'cause, yeah, it really is a game. As someone who is female-bodied-- I actually don't identify as a woman or a girl, I identify as non-binary, so I am trans in that way, that although my body is assigned female, I identify more outside of that. I think there's a lot of pressure when you're using it, knowing that, like, I don't know, knowing that people on there, they're like "Men seeking women," and then you're part of a stack of, like, women, and, that people, like, the guys that you might want to date date stereotypically feminine, gender role-conforming people, and there's a lot of pressure. Oh, my God, when people's profiles, when they're, like, like, "I don't-- like, I don't fuck with crazy bitches" or something... Yeah. "If you're not trying to fuck, swipe left." And I'm, like, not trying to fuck. Swipe left. "We all know why we're here." It's like, "But you don't know me!" Yeah, like, trying to be, like, the cool, like, "Yeah, I'm kinda like, I'm, like, bad." Hookup sex is bad, and for me personally, like, there has to be more intimacy to sex. It can't-- You know, there has to be this connection, there has to be this thing that I think is really cool about the other person, and you don't get that when you talked on Tinder for a day. They're like, "Oh, why don't you come over?" Like, "We'll smoke, like, we can sit on my bed and, like, listen to records." I'm like, "OK, that's bullshit, but, like, whatever-- like, OK, I know what this is." And you show up and it's uncomfortable. You kind of go in with this understanding, and I think a lot of people go into these situations kind of feeling obligated to. I know that's something that I feel a lot, where, you're going over, and it doesn't really matter if you're in the mood that day or not, because you're going over to, like, have sex. And you never have enough time to establish some chemistry, you just, like, start making out, and then, like, you have this sex where they-- and it's always, you know, like-- it's typically first encounters, unless you see this person as a hookup regularly afterwards, but, like, they don't know what you like, you don't know what they like, they're doing something and you're like, "That's kinda weird," and I'm sure I do the same thing for them. And, um... yeah. Yeah. ( camera clicks ) Woman: The dating apps, how they play into the sexual compulsive behavior and the sex addiction, is because of the accessibility of so many partners at any given moment. I think compulsive behavior is really about the high, not about a pleasure-- it's two different things, isn't it? With pleasure, it really-- you kind of need to connect with yourself, and be connected and present with yourself. And it really involves real connection on some level with yourself and another. Woman: I've always been clear with what I wanted on those dating apps, and I've gotten what I've wanted, and again, I feel like that's made me a stronger person, being able to say, "This is what I want, this is what I don't." For the most part, people have extremely respected what I've told them. And maybe that's because a lot of the time I was saying "I want casual sex," and guys are like, "Yeah! I'm OK with that!" But I don't know, if, ya know, if you're not clear with what you want, you're not gonna get what you want, I think. It's not good to generalize, but we do see, in the data, differences in the way that men and women use these services, in the way of how selective they are, in the way that they reflect their intentions for what they're looking for. It's just true that men and women, taken as groups, think about these things differently. That doesn't mean all men are looking for a hookup, it doesn't mean all women are looking for a relationship. But on the whole, a majority of women are looking pretty much exclusively for a relationship on these services, and a majority of the men are primarily looking to hook up. And you can say that that isn't so different than society at large, but I do think the way that these services are designed sort of tips the scale in culture towards hookups, and sort of gives men, or gives those looking for hookups the upper hand, essentially, in this new world. And at 4:00 a.m. I got a text message that went... something like: "Hey, you. Wake up. Time to come sit on my face now." ♪ Are you lookin' for me? ♪ ♪ Are you lookin' for someone? ♪ ♪ Where can you be? ♪ Hi, I'm Maurice. I'm an executive by day and a wild man by night. I'm looking for the goddess. Are you the goddess? Who is the goddess? The goddess is the woman, is a woman, is any woman... What I'm not looking for is some big, overgrown monster that's always thinkin' about food. A figure that is sexy, slim, tight, excellent legs... Hmm. Woman: If you think of courtship as something that has always existed, what's really new about dating is that it takes courtship away from private spaces, sort of away from the home, away from family, and explicitly puts it in market spaces. So it puts it in places where people spend money and consume, and I would argue that, in a way, maybe is the most distinctive change. And that means that from 1900 onward, or from the invention of dating onward, dating is shaped by market dynamics. To me, the real turning point or watershed is when you start having mobile dating apps, that everyone has it on their phones. The effect of mobile dating apps is to feel like we can be dating all the time and that you should always be putting yourself out there, always kind of promoting your "product." And I think that also takes away from the ability to just relax and enjoy. 'Cause it's hard work, that self-presentation stuff, which we all have to do when we're using dating apps and online dating. It's all self-presentation, it's all self-work, it's all self-consciousness, it's all performing. And when you go on lots of dates, you have to do that again and again and again and again. I usually delete it after I've been on a few bad dates, or I'm just like sick of constantly getting messages from people. I'm like, "I'm over weeding through all of this bullshit that I get, those hundreds of messages a day." I'm like, "This is exhausting, this is taking a lot of effort, it's taking a lot of time. This is actually like work right now." Just in economic terms, if you have a surplus of options, then the value goes down. I can see a Tinder profile that I'm excited about. If I met that person in real life, I would have this sense of urgency. But I think on Tinder, if I see that profile, well, then I just swipe one way or another-- I'm just swiping-- and then there's somebody else immediately. Weigel: You know, it is this application of the logic of consumer capitalism to private life, in this sort of way that romantic and sexual desire are used almost as a lure to get you to keep consuming. Maybe we don't think of it as part of the economy because a lot of apps are free, but what you're doing when you swipe and swipe, you know, swipe up and super-like or whatever it is, is you are providing valuable data to IAC, in that case, or to whatever corporation owns the app in question. The quicker that you can go from A to B, the more people are gonna use that service. And that's how they make money, so if they can help you get laid quicker by you paying for some feature that allows you to engage with someone more or faster, with a better emoji, whatever, that's how they're gonna make money. And so the thing that's so frustrating is when you hear these dating apps talk about, "Well, all these people have gotten married on our app." It's like, "No! That's not why you're doing this!" I get inundated every day with people thanking us for, you know, getting married on Tinder, or meeting their best friend or whatnot, and that's a beautiful thing. Interviewer: Do you have data on how many people who've met on Tinder have gotten married or been in committed relationships? We do not have that information available. But I can tell you that I am inundated with emails on a daily basis, as are multiple members of the customer service team, the PR team, from people who said, "I met my best friend on Tinder," "I met somebody who I am dating and now living with," "I met a man who I am going to marry," "I met this guy two years ago, we married a year ago, and we're having a baby." It's incredible, the number of people who have met via Tinder. Some people do use it to have more casual relationships, I mean, it is used that way as well. Certainly. People meet people at church, or meet people at their schools, and they have casual relationships with them as well. You can meet somebody in any context and have a casual relationship with them. Woman: That's why they can't get a relationship, we findin' out, we helpin' y'all. But you know what? This old man, he told me, he said, "The fruit on the top of the tree is the best, freshest fruit." He said, "You always want to have to reach to get what you want." He said, "The fruit at your foot, on the ground, you don't want that. The fruit that's throwin' itself at you, leave it alone." Am I tellin' the truth? Hello? I think people, older people, like their fifties and forties, they don't really get what it means to date now. They kinda don't understand, like, of course we want to get married and have kids and stuff, but you can't get yourself pregnant and marry yourself. I don't know what y'all problem is, 'cause I never had a problem datin'. - We didn't have social media. - Right. Brenda: And we had to go out. We had to meet. We went to games, parties and... you know, guys wanted to date you. They wasn't like, "Oh, I wanna date you, you, you and you." I think the social media is an issue, because when I was comin' up, you had to actually get out to socialize, in person, where here you can go on Facebook and the Snapchat or whatever that is, Twitter. And so I see a lot of their interactions is through devices, as opposed to social interacting. Go to museums. Go to classy places. I met my guy at the club, so... Everybody here met their boyfriend at a bar or a club. He's not my boyfriend. But we've been dating for three years. So you're not in a committed relationship? We're in a "situationship," yeah. What does that mean? A situationship is pretty much when, like, people are together, and they-- I don't want to say committed, they're sleeping with each other only, I guess you could say. They're sleeping with each other and acting like they're dating each other, but they're not boyfriend-and-girlfriend, they're not dating... and that's a situationship. To me, that's friends with benefits. I didn't ask him to make me his girlfriend. What if I didn't want him to be my boyfriend? But wouldn't that be a commitment if you guys are exclusive? We're still, like-- I feel like as a young woman I'm still trying to get my money, I want to go back to grad school... You don't want to be tied down? It's not about being tied down. It's about still having options. How can you be exclusive but not exclusive? I didn't say we were exclusive. But you said you're not committed, but you're not sleeping with someone else. Yeah, we're monogamous. But don't that mean commitment? Guys say that a lot. They want girls with benefits, or situationships, whatever, and they don't want committed relationships. A lot of girls want committed rela-- I want a boyfriend, I don't want a fuck buddy. Bree: Yeah, me either. I don't want a situ-relationship either, or whatever the hell it is. I don't want that either. If I'm gonna be seeing a man, and especially if I'm gonna be having sex with him, I at least want to be the title of a girlfriend. Bianca: We're just gonna be single forever. ( laughter, chatter ) Bilton: So, dating is changing because of the dating app, but dating is also changing because of the Internet. I have a friend that once said to me, "The entire Internet is a dating app." Because there are things that you do if you're interested in someone, if you like someone on Twitter, you can't, you know, swipe right on them, but you can start hearting all their tweets or replying to them or whatever it is, sharing their articles they like. And these are things that happen on every single platform. If you don't know the person and they're liking all your stuff, they wanna fuck. ( phone chimes ) How to Bag a Man on Social Media 101. So you find a guy on social media, you show him to all your girls, your girls approve, say he's cute, so you go through, you "like" some of his pictures, but you have to be very smart about which pictures you like, though, and it has to be spaced out at, like, a good increment. Do your research. Make sure he doesn't have a girlfriend. Tagged photos. Always go through his tagged photos. Tagged photos let you know everything about somebody. That's the real truth about someone. Who he's around, what he really gets into, things like that. So after that, you follow him. So you let that go by, he'll usually follow you back, 'cause, I mean, we're all bad as fuck, so most people follow us back. And that's when the game really starts. That's when you play this mind game with each other. For a few days you're liking each other's pictures, doing these little comments and things like that, and heart eyes, and you do the little eye emojis... There's two eye emojis. There's like the small ones, and there's the individual eye emojis. And then... by like day five, maybe less, you wake up and he's in your DMs. He DM'ed you. Yes. And at that point you start chit-chatting, and it's like, "Hey," blah blah blah-- then you get the number. So you start texting, boom boom boom, there's always a move in New York, "I'm gonna see you at this move." You link up at the move... boom. Catch the trick real quick... - And then that's that. - ...and there it is. Men in New York stress me out so much. They stress me out! This is why I don't have a boyfriend. Guys will have one girlfriend per network. I'll see a dude all over one girl's Instagram, a different girl all over Twitter, a different girl all over Facebook, have a different bitch on Snapchat. - Mm-hmm. - Yes. Dylan goes into your deep, dark secrets, like back to high school-- she looks you up. 'Cause they always use the excuse of, "Oh, but that's not my girl." "Oh, I'm not sleepin' with her." "Oh, we don't even talk like that." And the thing is, you never really know, you never know. He could have her number saved under Papa John's. How to catch your man cheating. A savvy cheater may be using less obvious ways to communicate with the person they're cheating with. For example, Instagram messages, Twitter direct messages, or Snaps on Snapchat. You can't trust anyone these days. It's sad but true. Dylan: I bagged with this one dude at this function, and then he kept messaging me on Snapchat, like, "Come to Queens," or "I'm trying to see you," blah blah blah. But I found his Instagram. I was on it that evening. I found it in like 15 minutes. And he has a ho-ass girlfriend. And then there was another occasion with a dude that I was actually like talking to and hooking up with, who had an entire relationship as well, and I didn't know until I went through his tagged photos on Instagram. And this is one recurring thing that I've dealt with for the last three years. You have Type 1, the dude who literally has his girl in half of his photos, and he's like, "My girl is my everything, I love this woman," very passionate, romantic, and he'll be the first one in your DMs begging you to come to his house at an ungodly hour, trying to smoke you out, buy you drinks, have sex with you with his girlfriend's stuff all over his apartment, but he's "so in love with her" on social media. It's like, my first time really getting my heart broken-- It's all coming back, 'cause it happened for the first time last year. When it first happened, I, like... it was the most I cried ever. But I'd never felt that low in my entire life, ever. I feel like he treated me like I was an object, almost. This is gonna sound so lame. Reminded me of, like, Nora from A Doll's House, like I was this... trophy girlfriend with the cool clothes and a lot of followers on Instagram. And I was a trendy DJ, and I was just cool to be with. But I don't think he genuinely, really, really wanted me. Photographer: ( indistinct ) When I was a kid, like, Sharon Stone in 1995 would be just like up on a pedestal and so inaccessible to me. And now the current version of that is like, "OK, she's just a swipe away, or she's just a message away." So, Instagram is full of beautiful women, pretty girls, popular celebrities, and a lot of you guys are like, "Hey, let me shoot my shot," but don't know how to do it. Rise and shine, ya cock knobs! I'm teachin' ya how to slide into DMs, which just means directly messaging someone, trying to get their phone number and/or trying to get their genitals smashed up against yours after a couple of drinks. Historically, men who did have a lot of sexual access to women tended to be higher in status. What you have is what I call Clark Kent Syndrome. You have these guys who may be mild-mannered in real life, but doesn't everybody want to be Superman? And this culture allows these guys who may, their whole lives, feel insignificant-- and certainly I'm not saying all of them feel this way-- to feel powerful. And what's the most powerful situation, is being aggressive, especially sexually aggressive. I just got a dick pic the other night from my friend's baby's daddy. Any guy will send you any stupid shit on there. That's what I'm sayin'. When you get a dick pic that you are not requesting, honestly, it's like a violation. If I'm refusing to see your penis in real life, I don't want to see it in a digital version. - We're about to see-- - OK! ( laughs ) Is it still on? Oh! Another one! ( both laughing ) He's like hitting me with dicks! Smacking you with dicks. Eww! ( gagging ) Wolfe Herd: So, enter Bumble. What is Bumble, and how does it strive to actually tackle this broken system of heteronormativity? Well... if you think about the way in which men and women generally connect, or the way that they're raised to connect, starting at a very young age, boys are taught to be the aggressor-- "Go get her." Bumble looks at that dynamic and says, "You know what? Only women are gonna make the first move." And why? Why are we gonna do that? Because women can have a voice. They are allowed to make the first move, they are allowed to go after what they want, and in turn, it takes all this pressure and this insecure, reactive aggression, away from the masculine side, because now the woman reaches out. You've just solved half of this predisposed problem. He doesn't have to be geared up to react to the rejection, right? So you've taken away the rejection and you've replaced it with flattery. So there's this idea that Bumble somehow fixes the mistakes that Tinder has made. I honestly don't see how it does that. Now the rule is, "The man doesn't have to lift a finger to even type you out a three-word message because he's not allowed to." So once again, women are shouldering so much more of the burdens of dating-- the communication work, the emotions work, all that stuff, the admin. Bumble is just codifying that women have to do more work. Woman: No, no-- OK. Yeah. There we go. There's the match. He said, "I'm only in Brooklyn for 12 hours, if you want to meet up, then let's do this." And then he says, "Are you tr--" Then he says, "Are you trans? Are you trans?" Then I say, "What the fuck? LOL. Down to fuck, but can't tonight. Meet me Tuesday or Wednesday in Manhattan." So... that's Bumble for you. That is Bumble for you. Uh, yeah. So this is my girlfriend Alex. And I met her on Tinder, and her tagline was "Stoned in the bath, eating Clementines." Fuck, babe! ( laughs ) Hook, line and sinker-- fell for it. Alex: He was sleeping with five girls a week on Tinder. - And then what? - And then he met me. Kyle: I mean, in our case, it just kinda happened. The more time we spent together, I was like, "Man, this chick is really cool," and it kinda just materialized. And I'm like, "Now I really like hanging out with her, more like in that best-friend kind of quality, rather than just the "Hit it and quit it" or... Hit it and quit it? So given that, we have discussed-- because Alex is what I guess you can define as heteroflexible-- ( laughs ) So given that, we have been, uh, like, experimenting with having a third. Just so it feels like there's not some sort of restraint or constriction on the relationship. Also it's fun, because-- that we get to, like-- we get to play with Tinder again. Interviewer: So you guys swipe together now on Tinder? - Yeah, we have a joint-- - On Binder, and on OkCupid, we have a joint OkCupid account. Oh, she's so beautiful. Uhh. Ohh, maybe not. She works out. Homegirl has too many tattoos. Homegirl has too many cats. Weird eyebrows. She's, like, my type but not your type. No, I-- I would do her. We like big boobs. ( laughs ) Kyle: If you look at our previous generation or the generation before, it's like, you meet someone in your hometown, you date them, they're like your high school sweetheart and you date them, and that's the only person that you've really been with. And that kind of monogamy is super-scary, it can go on for like 60 years in a vanilla type of existence, and it's super-bland, and then you die. Kyle: So praising the whole swiping fad that's going on now, it introduces you to people that you may never have crossed paths with. Could we see each other doing this forever? I don't know. I mean, definitely not past 60. ( laughs ) Not past 60? I was thinking, like, not past... I'm 27, so not past 30? Oh. OK. ( dance music playing ) Garcia: One thing we do know is that with the rise of the Internet many people that previously had a hard time connecting can now find someone else. So for instance, in our data where we know that over a third of people have met someone through the Internet, that number is even higher for gay men and lesbian women. And if you think about it, in many places it might be easy enough for a gay man or a lesbian woman to meet someone to date, but in many places throughout the United States, it might not be that easy. If you're talking about a population that is a minority group, in this case a sexual minority group, you then have to find someone else that meets the same criteria, and that might be kinda hard. And on top of that, in many places in the U.S. it still might not be all that safe for a gay man or a lesbian woman to walk into a bar and try and pick someone up. So the Internet has allowed people of so many different walks of life, to find each other, to connect with each other, and possibly start dating and have a relationship. We met on Grindr when he first moved here. Interviewer: Explain Grindr. Grindr is a gay dating app, mostly used for sex. It's a grid of pictures of guys in your area, ranked by how close they are, and... lots of torsos. Whenever you told straight people about Grindr two years ago, I mean, they were like, "Wow! Crazy! Do you do that all the time?" You're like, "No, but it is a thing because it's harder for us to meet people." It's so funny because men that label themselves as "straight" and then they just put like a headless torso and they're like, "I'm on the DL," but I'm like, "Are you really, if you're on this app?" And there's people on Grindr who are, like, "anon," they don't show their face, they don't want to know a name. You'll get those messages that are like, uh... "Depending on if you're the top or the bottom." It's like, "You can just walk in and I'll be blindfolded on all fours. And you just fuck me and then leave." I had a couple of friends who would get just almost zombified looking at the phone or checking for a hookup or trying to make something happen. Even when we were all out together. So it started to change the gay clubs because we'd all be there, and half the people were just looking at their phone. And you thought, "Well... but we're all already at the dance." You know? I think Grindr is the new way of hiding, honestly, because people are still hooking up all the time, but now they're sneaking into your apartment building or whatever, it's like this kind of respectability politics almost. - It's not like people-- - Man: Yeah. They think we don't have to cruise anymore, so we shouldn't, because we can just go on Grindr, "Why would you want to cruise when you can go on Grindr?" Well, because cruising is hot, it's fun, it's part of our history, it's part of our culture... I feel like it's really popular just to stigmatize Grindr and everything, and being like, "Only nasty people use that, I would never do it." But then they go home and then they use it. And it's like, that's what they do, that how they get laid. Their profile says, like, "I hate this app." ( all laugh ) Knowing that there's that technology there, like if I see a cute guy in the bar, I'm gonna immediately get on Grindr or Scruff and be like, "Well, is he on it?" 'Cause I can just, like, say hi there. Or just woof at him there. And then maybe... ( laughs ) he'll check it and see me across the bar. I know everything changes, and I'm acceptable to change, but there's parts of it that are like, "Oh, it's the future," and there's part of it that's like, "That's ridiculous." Like the amount of times I've lost with my friends just 'cause they're on their cell phone the entire time. And I can't tell you how many dates I've been on with girls that are on their cell phone the entire time. I've been on a date with a girl, she was talking to this dude she was kind of stringing along, while we were going on our first couple dates. 'Cause I've met girls that they're so involved with what they look like on the Internet, or spend so much time on making this image of themselves, and they worry about more Internet shit than real life. ( music, no audible dialogue ) Typically, tidy space, tidy mind, or whatever they say. Tidy area, tidy mind. No, tidy space, tidy mind. Basically, if your surroundings are tidy and neat and cleared out and nice and clean, I find that I just operate better... Cheyenne: I've thought about that when I hook up with people, I'm just like, "Do I look sexy right now? Do I look like appealing, do I look-- Do I look good? Does my face look weird-- from their angle? Does, like-- Is-- Is my hair cascading out right behind me?" Like, all this stuff. And I'm just like, "This is--" And because of that, obviously, I get super-removed from the moment, which is probably a big reason why I don't enjoy doing sexual stuff with people, because I'm so caught up in how I look. And then I'm also caught up in how they look. Alex, that guy that I just started dating, I guess-- that's so weird to say out loud-- he left his leftovers in my fridge, so I'm here to drop them off. I do love the emoji where it looks like you're... smiling with all your teeth-- I send that one a lot. I've sent him that a couple times. To some people that I love, I'll just send a row of emojis that's, like, a sunflower and a bouquet of flowers and then a star and a sparkly thing and a pink heart and then a yellow heart and then a blue heart. And then they know exactly what I'm saying. So it's great. - Hello. ( laughs ) - Hey! - How are you? - Pretty good. - Good. This is yours. - Oh, thanks. You're so welcome. How are you? I'm doing well. Oh. ( laughs ) - How was your shift? Yeah? - Really slow. Yeah. I hope this isn't terrible now. I hope so too, but it's OK if it's wilted and gross. - I might throw it away, though. - That's OK. He sent me a text with a heart emoji and then a smiley face and then another heart emoji. Which, like, it was just really cute, 'cause that never happens, because for some reason, boys don't like to use emojis. See? I'm tellin' you, full hearts, not heart eyes. Wild, right? What a concept! ( laughs ) ( riders shrieking ) Young Man: I feel like that's been a big switch, too. I feel like back in, like, the '90s and '80s, it was all about who could kind of show more. Like back then you'd have people serenading people, like showing up outside of windows with boom boxes or bringing people flowers, like huge, ridiculous things of flowers out in public. I feel like it's definitely, not like casual, but way more nonchalant nowadays. It's almost like you don't want to seem like you care. Interviewer: What if you do care? You have to not show it. Like, that sucks. If you do really care but you're trying to not show it, I feel like that kinda sucks. Yeah, I guess. I mean, I don't-- I don't know, I've never experienced something where I care so bad that I have to hide my care. ( chatter ) ( music, chatter ) ( no audible dialogue ) Definitely with technology progressing more and more, it's kind of like that awkward stage in generations where it's like do you just do technology to meet people, or do you actually go out and have experiences. It's kind of at the point where it's like, "All right, let's slide in those DMs, let's hit up Tinder" or something. But it's not as real, you know what I mean? Interviewer: What's a Tinderella? It's like a Cinderella, but with a Tinder. It's a slut. She's a Tinder slut. She's a Tinder slut. Yep. Yeah, she has acts with men through Tinder. Yes. It's a Tinder whore. Yeah, bas-- Well put. Who wants to slap the fuckin' bag?! All: Oh, yeah! ...four, five, six, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven! Skylar: Last night I went to a party, met a couple girls, you know, hooked up with a couple girls, and I now have their Instagram, and that's a way to keep in touch. It's not like a way to... a way to, like... I don't know, force anything on someone, you're not gonna be like, "Let me get your number, I'm texting you constantly to stay connected. Interviewer: You hooked up with a couple of girls at the same party? No-- Oh, yeah, at the same party-- Not the party we were at last night with you. We went to a different party. I hooked up with two girls at the same party. That's wild. ( laughs ) Interviewer: Do you guys watch a lot of porn? He watches porn, he watches porn, he watches porn, he watches porn. I don't watch porn. ( laughs ) Woman: Porn feeds into all of it. Porn feeds into sexual expectation, and the reason why I'm blaming porn is because the Internet has become such an integral part of just existing on this planet. And we had Internet access as very young children, - because we're-- - Porn has been cultivated. I was into porn before the Internet. ( all talking ) Porn opens your mind up to new experiences. - Porn teaches you things. - Porn can teach you. Even though some things you might feel like it's wrong, the older you get, the more sex you have, some of the shit that you like in porn, like choking and getting choked, is real. Dylan: Yeah, some girls like that shit. ( all talking ) I feel like porn makes a lot of guys, particularly, like they don't know the female body at all, they don't understand how to make a woman orgasm. And they look more at-- 'Cause when you watch usual porn, it's like the girls usually getting gagged or something, it's all about the male's pleasure, you don't really see anything with the female. Unless it's lesbian porn. What really shocked me about Internet pornography the first time I saw it was the fact that the pornographers consistently framed these regular old vanilla sex acts that everybody does sometimes as a form of humiliation for the women involved. It's not about their orgasm, except as, "It's sexy that it happens to always be a function of the male ejaculation" or the male pounding or whatever. In every mainstream porn gallery on the Web, we can find the "Rape" category side by side with the "Humiliation" category, "Abuse" category, "Crying" category and so on. With porn, people get flooded with images. Then when they do meet people on the apps, they expect the same kind of interaction and in fact, they're not really having sex with the person in front of them-- very often they might have sex playing out the images in their head. Like, ejaculating on a woman's face is not a naturally thrilling, attractive thing to do, until you see it in pornography, and you're like, "That looks awesome, I'm gonna do that." Guys get addicted to it, and girls get addicted to it, and it's fuckin' insane. I have this one friend back home who's like, he's like, "Yeah, I can't finish unless I watch porn." - What? - Yeah. Like he'll be fucking a girl, and then he's like, "I have to jack off or something to finish." It sounds like he has something wrong with him. Sounds like he watches way too much porn. Yeah, he watches way too much porn. The mind, like, de-- Yeah, desensitized. Yeah, it desensitizes, for sure. There are guys my age suffering from ED, because when they have a sexual relationship with a girl they can't perform because their mind is so... skewed already by porn. - It's an epidemic. - Interviewer: What do you mean? Men who, when they put a condom on, they lose their erection right away. And then they try to use that to weasel out of wearing a condom. They're like, "Oh, come on. We don't need it. I just got tested." And I'm like, "No, you didn't. I know you didn't just get tested." I think the condom problem is because of porn, because I feel like men are really used to their rough hand or something. And then like, they're like, "Oh, I'm not sensitive with a condom, and I can't feel you." I'm like, "Hmm..." Man: It's not even just porn. It's the appropriation of porn in culture. 'Cause sex sells. Sex is everywhere. You go to billboards, there's a bitch in a bra and basically nothing else. I have to be 100% real with you guys about the best pictures that us guys like to get from girls. Because I know that YouTube and people be like, "Uhh, the best curve on a woman's body is her smile." - ( record scratching ) - ( ding ) You know damn well the best curve on a woman's body - is that ass. - ( applause ) - It's gonna look like that. - OK. - And then you shoot it... - See, she's pointing it down. I'm pointing it down so the angle comes from the bottom. Woman: Kim Kardashian goes naked. Kourtney Kardashian shows off her nipple, and Kylie Jenner gets in the mix, too. What the hell is going on here? One thing we're seeing an increase in, for instance, is sexting. People are exchanging sexual messages and images, via text, via email, and sometimes via particular apps. I would say that nudes don't have to be pornography, but the way they generally exist and are treated, they are pornography by my definition, they're sexualized representations that circulate. And the circulation is key, because the problem with the way they're circulated is, that tends to eroticize use-- to eroticize just using somebody else's body for your own gratification. If it's in the right context, I really do like getting a dick pic-- it can be really great. But you have to be in the mood, and you have to want it, and there should be, like, a lead-up to it. 'Cause if you just get a dick pic cold, it's... Like, "I wasn't around. What did it for you?" I think that if you're already fucking, sending a nude throughout the day is just kind of like, A) Thinking of you. B) Reminding you how good that sex was the other day. 'Cause, like, you know, sometimes if it's been, like, two days you're just like, "Yo, refresher course. This was great, huh?" Like... ( laughs ) We can imagine that there are so many people with long-distance relationships, or perhaps they're busy with work and don't see each other enough, or perhaps they just want to communicate, "Hey, I'm turned on by you, I'm thinking about you." And sexting for them can be, perhaps, a totally fine, totally healthy way to communicate and share these erotic images. But there is an inherent risk. And in fact, that risk can also build intimacy-- knowing that you're exposing yourself to someone. Maybe not a good use of words. Nowadays, the fact that guys think it's so cool to expose girls, it makes it so hard for you to even feel like a guy that you're messing with can have a picture of you naked. Because if you guys ever stopped talkin' to each other, it's like, "Is he gonna put me on Twitter? Is he gonna put it on Instagram?" I got my phone taken away because I sent a picture to a guy in my bra and underwear in eighth grade, I remember that. He asked me for a picture, and I sent him a picture of my face. Then he was like, "No, not that type of picture." They always say that. And then you're like, "What type of picture you want?" And he's like, "You know, just less clothes." And it was just like-- I don't know. And he was showing everybody. You're young and you want to be cool and you don't want the person to, the next day, say something about you, like you're a kid or something like that. What often is called "revenge porn," which we could just say is the non-consensual distribution of sexual imagery, right, is when people violate, often, people's trust and confidence, and then post nude images of someone without their consent, and often knowingly in violation of their privacy. And when it appears online, or on Twitter, when it appears in any online network spaces and is shared, it will then often appear in a search of someone's name. Right? Which, when you search someone, who's searching for you? Clients, employers, friends, people you care about. And that's where the harm comes in, the potential for economic, physical, and sort of emotional harm. Woman: So, I was using a dating app when I met this guy. I'd gone on a few dates with him, but I hadn't gone home with him and slept with him, basically. And it didn't seem to be an issue for me, I didn't think it was awkward, but he seemed to think it was a thing. I found this website, and it was-- that was on his blog, it was a blog entry, like, a whole page dedicated to me and how much I sucked, basically. And he had gone through the last ten years of my social media on Facebook, Instagram, all these outlets, and taken the worst photos of me that exist. It's quite common for people to set up a site, often in the victim's or the targeted person's name, that says, for example, "Don't hire so-and-so" or "So-and-so is a crackhead." That would be the name, the domain name, of the site. Right? And that what you do on that site is essentially do whatever you can to hurt the reputation and to terrify the person. And he make this huge, like, mosaic of, like-- it was at least 20 photos, maybe 30 or more, it was like-- it was a lot of photos of just all these up-close terrible shots me like, drinking, parties when I'm 17, 18, or whatever, and just looking awful, you know? And it was so embarrassing, and it was like, "Fuck, what is this?" And then he posted under it like, a story that was completely, like, made up and shit, that said-- I think it said that "Nicole Disser smoked crack" and all this stuff. And it was crack specifically, you know. It's like, "That's outrageous and weird." So I tried contacting the web host or whatever who hosts the domain, and they never got back to me, and then I contacted Instagram and Facebook to be like, "This guy is using my photos without my permission," and I never heard from any of them. And then it was the dating app that I contacted, and they said to call the police, because they couldn't do anything. You've got officers who are great at street crimes-- it's what they know well. But when you come to them with a problem that involves having to investigate your online footprints and who it is that did this, they just feel outpaced by the technology, they don't know what to do. I thought that it might be a good opportunity for one of those companies to sort of come to the rescue in a way, and be like, "Look, we protect our users." Ya know? Especially the dating app. I thought that they would maybe have a better reaction than very just sort of, I don't know, like "It's not our issue," I guess. Badeen: The ethical implications of what we're doing are always weighing upon us. Everything from bullying to just inappropriate behavior. And it's something that... almost every conversation we have around here is about how we can help that. It's included with every new thing that we come up with, making sure that we create a safe and comfortable environment for our users. There's a lot more that we could do, just like every platform. And we're gonna-- we're working on all sorts of things. Don't know all the ways we're going to do that, but collectively, we'll figure something out, I'm sure. We better. We have to. Interviewer: Have you ever heard from anybody who's had something bad happen? Badeen: Directly, I have not. Nobody's personally come to me with it. But there's certainly been a few different news stories and all that have occurred. I don't know any specifically. Strimpel: There are stories from a hundred years ago of women being murdered when meeting a man that advertised in the Lonely Hearts section of the newspaper. Luckily, these are not everyday stories, but they do underscore the huge risks involved, and moreover, they do kind of ask us to think more deeply about why it is that when a woman is murdered, it is likely to be by someone who she's in a sort of intimate situation with. So we do need to get beyond just blaming dating apps, we need to also think about what's going on more deeply in society that for all the gains women have made, the domestic violence figures speak for themselves, murder figures speak for themselves, women are still being murdered and physically abused by men on a hugely regular basis. This dude is freaking psychotic. He drunkenly came to my house at like 5:00 in the morning. Mind you, I'd invited him over at probably like 11:00, thinking he was gonna get there by, like, 1:00 and I could kick him out around 3:00. 'Cause I didn't want to sleep with him at the time, it was way too early. So he comes there mad late, clearly drunk as hell, so I'm like, "All right." And he took a cab there from wherever he was. So I'm like, "OK, I don't want to be a bitch because you just spent all this money to get to my house, I understand you're late and you probably want to just sleep, it is what it is, I'll let you crash." He gets in my bed, literally tries to force himself on me, and I just wasn't rockin'. And I literally had to hold my clothes, push this nigga off me, I'm not yelling because I don't want to wake my roommates up, 'cause I'm not getting raped and I'm thinking eventually he's gonna get a hint. Then he drunkenly passes out, I wait about an hour, and I'm like freaking out, and then I kick him out of my apartment. And obviously, I kind of set myself up for it, so I'm kind of an idiot for that. I'm not emotionally distraught over it or anything. Just one of those, like, "Y'all need to do better." And I'm so glad that it didn't get worse, 'cause there are so many scenarios where I've heard, like, where it has, where other women, not with him in particular, but just in general. And I know so many of my very, very, very, very close female friends have experienced very negative encounters with men, and I'm just grateful that nothing on that level has happened, 'cause it's very possible, and I pray that it never does. I wouldn't even wish that shit on my enemies. Cheyenne: Even when I had my old boyfriend and we would do stuff like... he always kind of vaguely pressured me into stuff, which wasn't cool. So we'd be hanging out and we'd be watching TV, and I just wanted to cuddle and watch TV, and then he would start kissing my neck or whatever and sort of get on top of me, and I would kinda pull away and be like, "I just kinda want to sit here," and then he would put his hands up my shirt and all this kinda stuff. And I would just try and turn away. And then it always just got to a point-- He knew that I would just get to a point where I was like, ( sighs ) "OK, I guess we're doing this." And so we'd do whatever. And it was literally... every single time we were alone. Every single time. I'm realizing now, looking back on it, that it was a little bit more fucked up than I thought it was. Dylan: I see people try to justify, like, the rape of a spouse, or the rape of a girlfriend or a boyfriend. These are things that are embedded in our society. It's definitely something that the Internet and social media is enlightening a lot of young women to realize "I'm valuable, I don't have to put up with your shit, and I also don't have to be treated like a sex object for the rest of my life, and I'm also capable of doing whatever I want, and if your politics don't correlate with mine, that's cool, but I'm gonna still do me at the end of the day." ( laughter, chatter ) So what if there's a dating app that was designed around how women perceive attraction? Like, would that be different? What if you designed a dating app? What would it be like? Cheyenne: If I'm designing a dating app-- I don't know. I feel like there's no way to get around the fact that men - can be fucking disgusting. - Oh, absolutely. I think it's the fact that women have always been seen as an object of pleasure or an object of, like, something secondary, something inferior. - A vessel. - Yeah, it's a vessel. And even nowadays, it's sort of like, "The only reason that you exist in this space is for my viewing pleasure." I'm not saying that everyone who does dating apps is terrible or gross or anything, but the fact that you have to work your way through so many people that are just like either total bullshitters or obviously only after sex, and not after anything substantial, so you're like, "OK," and it just gets exhausting, so I'm just like "Why bother?" Young Woman: Cheers! ( siren wails, horn honks ) What the #MeToo movement has done, it's really created this huge voice in the community, and that voice is strong, and I do feel as a woman running the largest set of dating products in the world, that we have to listen to that voice and we have to adapt our products, how we work internally, our sensitivity to things, and especially as we-- we are creating social products that sit in the hands of women, and this is a time where we-- I do think it's important for us to both protect, listen, and create products that are relevant to women. Interviewer: Then how are you going to do that? I mean, I think there's a couple of things that we need to do. One, we have safety tips. First of all, it's really important that women don't meet people-- they never go to someone's house, they meet in a public place, they don't drink, they let someone know where they're going, they are-- they take precaution, they let a person know that they're on a date with someone else, they never go into someone's car, and so there's a number of safety tips that we provide for people, and I just think that people also have to just take real precaution. There have been reports of a rise in sexual violence related to online dating. Do you think dating apps are contributing to rape culture? The sad thing is that, you know, because there's so many millions and millions of people on our products-- one out of every two single people have a profile on a dating app today in the United States-- then it is truly what happens in a society happens on the apps as well. Alter: I don't see it slowing down. I mean, why would it slow down? It's making a lot of money for a lot of different companies and a lot of people. We're getting better at designing experiences that are addictive because we understand it more now than we ever did before. So I don't see it slowing down. I think it's only gonna be weaponized, and I think when virtual and augmented reality become a really big deal, can you imagine dating apps where you can actually interact in a room with the people that you're swiping? Why wouldn't people spend 24 hours a day on these apps if they feel like they're actually in a room with other people? And if they don't like them, they can get rid of them ASAP, no problem, but if they do, you're actually that much closer to actually being on a date with them without having to do anything. You can sit in your boxer shorts at home and be on a date with someone-- why wouldn't you do that? We know there are sex robots, and we know that now there are appendages that you can attach to yourself that make an experience feel like sex. And so it's just gonna be a more immersive version of that over time, the virtual and augmented reality. I don't know, we were just drifting further and further apart, and, like, towards the end it felt like we weren't even really... like, in a relationship. Kyle: I definitely became more distant. I don't know why. Yeah, you used to four or five times a day be, like, "I'm gonna marry you, you know that?" I could have been delusional, but it felt right at the time. - Whatever. - He was just excited about having somebody to love. It's sweet. There's nothing wrong with that. All I wanted to do is just say, "Let's be friends, but let's keep it open-ended." - He went on a date on Friday... - Friday. - I don't know. - Well, he got laid. You've got laid too. Get the fuck out of here. Yeah, I have gotten laid, but I didn't get laid on Friday on my date. - He met the-- on Tinder. - You downloaded Tinder too. - OK, yeah. - You're just as guilty. Tinder exhausts me. I'm so, like, I just downloaded it so that I could judge people and, like, swipe. I like doing the swiping. I always have. Bullshit. Yeah. And then-- "And then I end up going on a date with a guy." Well, no, he seems nice, but I wasn't planning on sleeping with him. But yeah, and then I was like, "Hmm. Yeah, I don't know." I just-- He came back from the bathroom, and I was like... "I'm really sorry. I just-- I just wanna go home." ( laughs ) And then I just left. So, ya know, I'm not like, uh... I don't know. I just wanted someone to talk to... for, like, an hour. But I don't know. Tinder is exhausting. I don't wanna-- Nothing good happens from Tinder. Yeah. Well, we met on Tinder. ( music playing )
