[fan 1, in Spanish] He lied to Barça fans. [fan 2, in Spanish] He broke our hearts. He's gonna pay. [fan 3, in Spanish] He's a mercenary. He can go to hell. -[emergency vehicle siren wails] -[air horn booms] [people chanting] [man, chanting] Barça! Barça! [commentator 1, in Spanish] Welcome to football in its purest form. One of world football's great derbies. A NETFLIX DOCUMENTARY [crowd roaring] [commentator 2, in English] Barcelona vs Real Madrid. Catalonia versus Spain. But tonight, it is all about one man. [commentator 4, in Portuguese] It's a hostile reception, especially for Luís Figo. Traitor, mercenary, Judas. That's what the Barcelona fans are calling him, even though he was once a hero in Catalonia. [commentator 5, in Spanish] Watch out! This could explode at any moment! CATALONIA DOESN'T FORGET. JUDA$!! [commentator 1, in Spanish] They're throwing everything at Luís Figo. Everything. [Barça fans yelling expletives in Spanish] [commentator 1, in Spanish] It's over. The game's about to be suspended. [continues commentating] [commentator 2, in English] Seems like only yesterday that Luís Figo was worshipped in this stadium. How on earth did it end up like this? [Barça fans jeering at Figo] [Figo] So many people think they know the story. But I'm the one that knows the truth. Because I'm the protagonist. I lived it. Now everyone can tell their story, and I'll tell mine. LISBON [music playing quietly through radio] [anchor, in Catalan] Portuguese footballer Luís Figo will be playing the next two seasons for Barcelona, according to sources in the Portuguese press. Figo, 22, a player for Sporting Lisbon, is currently one of Portugal's biggest football stars. Figo will leave this modest neighborhood, 11 kilometers from Lisbon, for a life of luxury in Barcelona. [Figo, in Spanish] I felt this huge sense of happiness and joy. Barcelona was a team I followed and admired. [indistinct dialogue] I felt like a kid with a new ball. [interviewer speaking in Spanish] It was the first trip I made to play overseas. And it was going to be a completely different reality for me. A new country, a new championship. I was very young. I was going to live on my own. Not with my parents anymore. [anchor, in Portuguese] Luís Figo, until now a Sporting Lisbon player, arrived in style, alongside his agent, José Veiga. [reporter] Figo! Figo! -[reporter 2] Figo! Figo! Figo! Hello. -[Figo] Hello. [reporter, in Spanish] Are you surprised by this reception? In a way, but when you consider the size of the club, I'm not that surprised. [reporter] Do you realize you're Barça's star-signing this season and that there are huge expectations for you? Sure. I just hope I can live up to those expectations. -[reporter] Are you happy, Luís? -Yes. I'm very happy right now. ["Cant del Barça" plays] [Figo] I thought it was a massive club, where I could get what I wanted, to gain more prestige and win titles. And since I was passionate about Cruyff and his Dream Team, I didn't hesitate. I had the support of most of the Spanish players. Especially Pep. And that helped me fit in and identify quickly with the club and with the culture. -Has it been 20 years? -[interviewer] Yes. Fuck. You know what? Maybe I've actually forgotten a lot of the questions I wanted to ask him back then. It's crazy how time moves on. We were together a lot. We shared hotel rooms on away games. We were roommates. So we ended up spending a lot of time together. We were inseparable. [crowd roaring] [commentator, in Catalan] Hi from the Nou Camp, where Barcelona take on Real Madrid. And here comes the team from the capital. [Guardiola] I remember in Figo's early days, I went over to Cruyff and said, "Who the fuck have you signed?" As in, this guy is very, very good. [commentator, in Spanish] Guardiola to Figo. [commentator speaking enthusiastically] [commentator shouting excitedly] [Guardiola] During our time together at Barcelona, he was an amazing player, in capital letters. [commentator 1, in Catalan] Hello from Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid. What an atmosphere for the Spanish Cup final. [commentator 2, in Spanish] Barcelona and Real Betis are just moments from kickoff. [commentator speaking in Catalan] The best thing about Luís was that when you were in trouble, he'd step up. [commentator speaking in Catalan] 1-1 FIGO, MINUTE 45 [commentator shouting enthusiastically] [Guardiola] There are many great players who, when the going gets tough, struggle sometimes. He was the complete opposite. If things were tough, he'd say, "Give me the ball," and he'd try to find a way to change things. [commentator speaking in Catalan] [commentator speaking excitedly] [commentator 2, in English] Barcelona have scored what I think might be the winner! FIGO GOALS 2 [commentator speaking in Catalan] [in Catalan] Here it is! [in Spanish] Who scored the winning goal yesterday? [crowd] Figo! [chanting in Spanish] Don't stop, Figo, Figo! Don't stop, Figo, Figo! Don't stop, Figo, Figo! Don't stop… [reporter, in Portuguese] You can get a Figo calendar, a postcard, a poster, and Figo's number-seven shirt. It's truly Figo-mania. [commentator 1, in English] Welcome to the Nou Camp. And there's no bigger game than this. It's Barcelona against Real Madrid. El Clásico. [commentator 2, in Spanish] Here at the Nou Camp, Barcelona can become the 1997-98 league champions. Playing against Luís Figo is to suffer. Playing against Luís meant not sleeping well at night. He was the captain of Barcelona, and my job was to mark him. I knew what I had to do, but it was impossible. [commentator speaking in Spanish] [Carlos] He was number one in the world. [commentator speaking in Catalan] [commentator 3, in Spanish] Barcelona can taste the sweet victory of a league title. [commentary continues] [Carlos] To say that Figo was the symbol of the club sums up perfectly his time at Barcelona. [Figo] I identified with the values of the club. I defended them to the death. And that's why I think I was seen as one of them. [in Spanish] I think there are certain people that should congratulate us. [spectators cheering raucously] [chanting] Madrid crybabies! Bow down to the champions! Madrid crybabies! Bow down to the champions! Long live Barça! [commentator speaking in Spanish] [commentator shouts joyfully] [commentator] Barcelona are the 1998-99 league champions! This is their sixth league title of the '90s. They've won as many titles this decade alone as they have in the past 40 years. [reporter, in Spanish] Luís, first of all, congratulations. Is this concrete evidence of Barcelona's current superiority? [in Spanish] Well, right now, I think Barça has amazing professionals, amazing, uh, uh, players, and we're definitely the best club in the world. Champions, man! We're the best. Long live Barça! [man speaking in Spanish] [Figo, present] We won the league two seasons in a row. We won because we were the best. -[Figo singing] -[people clapping] [Figo, present] It was a fantastic period for me, and at such a young age. It was also when I met my wife. My first daughter was born in Barcelona. The truth is, I was very happy. [Figo, in Portuguese] It's 31st March. Daniela just turned one, and we're celebrating at home. [people singing "Happy Birthday" in Spanish] [interviewer] Do you remember Figo's last season? Did he seem unhappy? Did he mention anything about his contract? No. No, never. He had a great knack of separating football from life off the pitch. Uh… I remember in his final months, there were so many rumors about that. We talked about it. About how he was. He said he was fine and what would be would be. But he was his usual self. [Figo, present] I was happy in the city and at the club. But what was important for me was to feel valued for what I gave to the club. Perhaps there were times when I didn't feel as valued by those in charge at the club compared to the team supporters, the fans. For me, happiness was playing football and the recognition I got. [commentator speaking Spanish] [in Spanish] I can't comment. I don't know what will happen. But I hope things get resolved, and we can all relax. I was going to say, "Enjoy your time off," but you don't get time off. -So, good luck at the Euros. -Thank you. When you feel that way, so people don't appreciate what you give, then maybe there's another club that will acknowledge you. ["Zadok the Priest" by Handel plays through TV] [commentator, in English] Despite yet another disappointing season domestically, but Real Madrid are one game away from conquering Europe once again. Madrid face Valencia in an all-Spanish Champions League final. [commentator speaking in Spanish] [commentator speaking with growing excitement] [commentator yelling enthusiastically] [commentator, shouting] Real Madrid, three-nil! Real Madrid can now count up to eight European Cups! The culture at Real Madrid means that you have to play in the Champions League and win it. [chanting indistinctly] [Carlos] Our preparation was always focused on the European Cup because of how long it had been since we'd won it. For me, there's no doubt it's the key moment in Real Madrid's recent history. No doubt at all. [celebratory music plays] [Hierro] It restored the club's power and status in Europe. [chanting] [Hierro] Those two Champions Leagues won under Lorenzo Sanz were great for the club. ["Hala Madrid!" by José de Aguilar playing] [Hierro] As a president, Lorenzo was extremely warmhearted. He was very close to us, like a father figure. ["Hala Madrid!" continues] Spain is a unique country where the presidents are the stars. They have a strong public presence. They have a strong presence within the team and in the dressing room. The president needs to be front and center as a symbol for the club. [in Spanish] It's official. This summer, Real Madrid's members will have to vote for their president. Lorenzo Sanz has one year left as president but has decided that this is the right time to ensure another term in charge. [anchor 1, in Spanish] Now we wait and see if there's a candidate capable of challenging a president who's won two Champions Leagues in three years. [anchor 2, in Spanish] Today, we have a very special guest on our program. He's 53 years old. He's a civil engineer. He's married. He's been a member of Real Madrid for 40 years. [unheard dialogue] [anchor 3, in Spanish] Please welcome Florentino Pérez. [Pérez, in Spanish] Good evening. [anchor 2, in Spanish] Are you Real Madrid's next president? I am sure of it. We knew he was an important and powerful businessman who loved football. And he had put himself forward as a candidate in the presidential elections. THIS IS HOW MADRID WINS But we didn't know much about him. [interviewer] Why do you think someone want to be president of a football club? For many reasons. Why would someone want to be president of a nation? For the power. To call the shots. In Florentino's case, he'd been at Madrid since the day he was born. His father made him a member. And I think that it's his life. It's been his whole life. To me, as a man, he was just as calculating then as he is now. Just as emotionally cold, but perhaps he was more naive about the world of football than he is now. REAL MADRID PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN FLORENTINO PÉREZ Football's about results. Real Madrid had just won two Champions Leagues, and I thought, "How's Florentino gonna win?" He put out this message that even though Real Madrid had won two Champions Leagues, pretty much back-to-back, something was missing. They needed players of a certain caliber to restore a reputation, which in his view, had faded on the international stage. [unheard dialogue] [Pérez, in Spanish] There are two ways of winning. In small letters or in capital letters, which is the way the teams of Real Madrid have always won in the past. What I want to do is win in capital letters. That's why this is the best-known and most prestigious club in the world. This club, as everyone knows, has been declared Club of the Century by FIFA, and this is because of its unique style and way of acting. Unfortunately, we're far from that image now. [TV commentator, in Spanish] There was nothing that could stop Di Stéfano. Real Madrid has won the very first European Cup. Madrid is unique, firstly, because of its history. [commentator, in Spanish] This amazing feat by Real Madrid justifies the huge show of support by their fans. [commentator speaking in Spanish] [commentators shouting with delight] Precisely because they don't have a clear cultural, social, or political identity as such, Real Madrid's imperative is to win. [commentator speaking in Spanish] [Valdano] Florentino Pérez had a mythical ideology of Real Madrid. He'd always idealized the club, and he wanted to make the club live up to this ideal. [interviewer, in Spanish] Mr. Pérez, best of luck in your election campaign. Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to talk to you and my fellow members. [indistinct dialogue] [De la Morena] I remember having lunch with him and telling him I thought it was practically impossible. I said, "You have a glass jaw, and in the world of football, where everyone has a loaded tommy gun under their coats, you won't last two days." And he said, "Well, that's what you think. In the business world--" I said, "The business world has nothing to do with this." "This is very different." [interviewer] When did Florentino first mention the plan to sign Figo? At our first meeting. He asked for my thoughts on the player. He sees football as a heroes' business, and he set his sights on the best in the world from day one. 4 WEEKS TO THE ELECTIONS [cellphone rings] [man] I was at home. A friend of mine called me. He said, "Hey, man. Where are you?" I said, "I'm in Madrid." He replied, "Come here now." "It's urgent. Can you come here now?" [stopwatch ticking] [Futre] I saw this impressive building. I went inside. The secretary took me to an office and introduced me to Florentino Pérez. It was the first time that I'd ever heard that name. This man is running in the Real Madrid presidential elections. But he'll only run if Luís Figo joins with him. I thought it had to be a joke. What was I doing there? [interviewer] How would you describe Paulo? Spectacular. He's spectacular. Paulo was my hero. -[commentator, in Spanish] It's Futre! -[crowd roars] [Figo, present] He was Portugal's best player, so I grew up admiring Paulo. And then, and I don't know how, he became involved in my transfer. Paulo's capable of anything. [tense rhythmic music plays] [Futre] Figo had a €60 million release clause. Who's paying that?! "Don't worry," he said. [in Portuguese] "I'll pay it." [cellphone rings] [Futre] So then I called Figo's agent, José Veiga, who was a good friend of mine. [cellphone rings] Back then, I was the top agent in football. [in Portuguese] "Hey, José. How's it going?" And I was like, "Paulo, please. Don't call me." He called me in the evening to tell me there's a candidate trying to win Real Madrid's elections who wants to sign Figo. "It's not possible. No, Paulo. Let it go." "Let's talk another time, not now." Then he hung up on me. But I kept the phone to my ear. And I keep on talking. And I was like, "Yes, sir. Okay." [tense music continues] [Futre] And those 30 to 40 seconds, when I was pretending to talk to José, are key to the whole operation. So what was I thinking? If Florentino Pérez can pay €72 million in cash, he can afford more. Cogs were turning in my head. So I put the phone on the table, and I say to Florentino, "He wants €10 million in commission." And he says, "€5 million." And we shook on six. [phone ringing] [Veiga] Paulo never stops, and he called me again. "Man, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity." "It's unprecedented." It was classic Paulo Futre. "Zé, calm down. Don't hang up. Calm down. Six million in commission." [in Portuguese] "€6 million in commission waiting for us." "Calm down. Don't hang up!" And then José said, "What?!" "€6 million in commission?" And that day, the Luís Figo saga began. It's incredible it began with a lie. [Veiga] So I went to meet with Florentino Pérez in his office at ACS in Madrid. Don Florentino explained the project to me. Everything he said made sense, but it would be very difficult to execute. So I said, "I'll have a word with Luís and get back to you." Luís Figo was in the Netherlands for the European Championships, so I headed straight there. PORTUGAL TRAINING CAMP EURO 2000 [reporter, in Portuguese] This morning, José Veiga arrived at Portugal's hotel. José Veiga is Luís Figo's agent. Veiga is likely to be discussing the player's future. [Figo] The information I had was that there's this person who I didn't know at all. "There's this person who wants you to sign for Madrid." "If he wins the elections." "He wants you to say that you'll sign for Madrid if he wins." I said, "Are you crazy?" "How can I say to someone, when I don't even know if he's gonna win, that I'll go to Real Madrid, when I have a contract at Barcelona?" "There's no way I can do that. Ever." No club had ever spent so much on a player. They were offering four times what I was making at Barcelona. It was something that I found hard to believe. -[fans, chanting] Figo! -[Figo] It was a strange summer because there were also presidential elections at Barcelona. It's unusual for both clubs to have elections at the same time. But that's what happened. I said to my agent, "Keep talking." "Keep talking with the relevant people. Keep talking, and let's see what happens." Luís said, "Okay, go to Barcelona, and see if there's a possibility that my contract can be improved." "If they do that, I'll stay at Barça." [crowd cheering] ["Cant del Barça" plays] [anchor, in Spanish] The race for Barça's next president has begun. Joan Gaspart is the big favorite to succeed the current president. [in Catalan] It's the end of an era at Barcelona but the beginning of a new one. And Barça's members can choose a new president. PASSION FOR BARÇA [Gaspart] My candidacy was very easy. I didn't have to present myself to the members of Barça and tell them, "Vote for me." All I said was, "Here I am. I've been vice president for 22 years." "You already know the good and bad about me." [in Catalan] Get it into your head. Barça is the best club in the world. Don't say that we need to make Barça the best club in the world. It already is! [Veiga] The Joan Gaspart I know isn't an easy character to deal with. He was viewed as a person who loved his dear Barcelona, which is indisputable, but he was also someone who made promises he didn't keep. So, when it came to trusting his word, he always left you with doubts. [speaking Catalan] [Veiga] I went to Barcelona, and I said to Joan Gaspart that we have an offer that we can't refuse. I didn't mention the club involved. But I said, "We would like to see if we could improve the terms and conditions of Luís Figo's contract." It was a kind of obsession that Luís had. From time to time, he or Veiga would ask for more money. But that's normal in the world of football. [Veiga] And Joan Gaspart replied, "No, that's unthinkable." "No way. I'm not going to do it." "I'm not renewing anybody's contract right now." "Anyway, there are going to be elections, and during this process, we're not renewing any contracts." [in Spanish] Figo has a contract with Barça, which ends in three or four years. He wants to improve his contract, but right now, we have no intention of doing so, because we did that a year ago. [commentator, in English] So much attention on Figo as Portugal begin their Euro 2000 campaign. [commentator] Figo. [spectators cheer raucously] [commentator, in English] Oh, goodness me! [Figo, in Spanish] The president says he can't solve anything, and I should talk to the candidates. The candidates say they don't have the power to negotiate, and I should talk to the president. So I'm being sent from one to the other. People talk about feelings, which, of course, I have, but I need those feelings to be reciprocated. At the end of the day, it's a relationship. [in Spanish] But it seems like no one is willing to listen to me in order to make a decision. I went back to the Netherlands. I explained the situation to Luís Figo, and he said to me, "I'd like to stay at Barcelona." [English commentator 1] It's Portugal and Turkey for a place in the semifinals. [English commentator 2] Simply done. Ünsal trying to make something of it. Referee doesn't wanna know! And that's a second. "Go and speak to Joan Gaspart one last time." "Joan, let's be really clear." "This is serious." "If we don't reach an agreement and you don't make a move, Barcelona will lose Luís Figo." "No! That's impossible." "You're trying to negotiate with me. You're blackmailing me." "If someone pays the release clause, if someone brings the check, then I'll pay for you and Luís Figo to fly first-class on a red velvet carpet out of here." "Bring the check for the release clause because I don't believe there's a club in the world that can pay that amount." So I said, "Okay, Joan, if that's what you want, that's fine, then we're going to move forward." So I called Luís Figo. [answering machine clicks, beeps] [Veiga, in Portuguese] There's clearly a lack of will here so far. Look, when people want to solve problems, they will solve them. [Figo] Gaspart treated me like a nobody. It wasn't something I was expecting. I'd expected maybe a bit more warmth. Some kind of recognition. And I felt a bit pissed off. I went away after speaking with him, thinking, "For fuck's sake, this guy thinks it's all a bluff." "A way to improve my contract again." So it all started because I was pissed off. [commentator, in English] The Euro 2000 semifinal in Brussels. France against Portugal. And Zidane scores! And France are in the final! Luís Figo and his Portuguese team are heading home. [in Portuguese] You're here with Portugal, but talking of personal matters, will you stay with Barcelona next season? [in Portuguese] Let's not speak about me. Just Portugal. When will you speak about yourself? I never speak about myself. So you won't comment on which club you'll be playing for? Look, I have a contract, and I expect to fulfill it. [paparazzo] Figo! [Figo] I went on holiday. And a few weeks later, I think things really began to develop, and they started to snowball. And then it became a lot more serious. 11 DAYS TO THE ELECTIONS [De la Morena] Someone leaked a story to me one night. That Florentino might be trying to sign Figo. I spoke with Florentino. He got quite flustered and said it wasn't true. Then he said it was true. And I said, "I'm running the story." Then he said, "If you run it, you'll fuck things up for me." "Don't do it. Shit. You'll fuck everything up for me." And I said, "I'm running it at midnight." ["Ra, Ra, Ra" by Benito Moreno plays] [De la Morena] It was a Wednesday. Míchel Salgado was getting married to Lorenzo Sanz's daughter. I was at the wedding. [reporter, in Spanish] You more nervous for the wedding or elections? [in Spanish] I'm not thinking about the elections today. [De la Morena] How could I know that MARCA wouldn't leak the story online? They could leak it first. "Figo signs for Madrid." Then the story's theirs. So I look at the time. It was 6:20 p.m. Right in the middle of the ceremony. I left the church. I wasn't waiting till midnight. I'd break it at 8:30 p.m. [journalists speaking indistinctly] -[camera shutters click] -[speaks Spanish] I got into my car. -[electronic beep] -I heard the beeps. Cadena SER news. [Cadena SER jingle plays] [De la Morena, in Spanish] Figo will be Real Madrid's new signing if Florentino Pérez becomes president. Then I came up with a story to make it even bigger. I said, "Florentino has said that if Figo doesn't come to Madrid, he'll pay every fan's season ticket and club membership fees." I made that part up. Florentino called me, "You bastard, do you know what you've done?" "And you even said I'll pay the membership fees!" In the car behind me was Lorenzo Sanz. And he hears the news in the car. When we arrived at the reception, Lorenzo sees me and shouts at me, "They made a fool out of you! You've fallen for it." And I said, "You tend to the bride. That's your job." And he kept on and on. "You've made an idiot of yourself. They've played you. They've played you." After that, it was the only news in town. [in Spanish] Cadena SER has broken the news that Florentino Pérez, one of Real Madrid's presidential candidates, may have sealed the signing of Luís Figo. [in Spanish] Everything suggests Florentino Pérez has signed Luís Figo… …one of the best players in the world. But he won't leave for free. €60 million is his asking price, making him the most expensive player of all time. FIGO IS FLORENTINO'S BOMBSHELL FIGO IS THE BOMBSHELL It was a real bombshell. However, at the time, all of us were saying, "It's impossible." Because it was impossible. Back then, it seemed totally impossible. It would be like Real Madrid signing Messi. [in Spanish] Impossible. Like saying you want to take Raúl from Real Madrid. What would the Real Madrid squad say? What would the other players say? We were all on holiday when the rumor started that Figo was coming here to the club. I didn't believe it. I talked to some of the other guys on the phone, like Iker and Fernando Hierro. FLORENTINO SIGNS FIGO WAR OVER FIGO To be honest, I didn't believe it. No. The precontract was such a big deal. Everyone knew what his release clause was and that it would be activated if Florentino won the elections. And, personally, I thought it was impossible. [in Spanish] The Portuguese player's agent admits there has been contact, but as of now, Pérez is silent on the matter, although he doesn't deny the news. [Spanish] If I'm president of Real Madrid, the best players will play for Madrid. [reporter, in Spanish] So you don't deny an agreement's been signed? What I don't deny is that if I'm president, Madrid will have the best players. [reporter 1, in Spanish] Figo's agent was more forthcoming and admits being in contact with Florentino Pérez. [Veiga, in Spanish] If he says it's true, then it is. I had a meeting with him last week. This is now public knowledge, and Florentino knows what he's saying. And if he's saying it, it's because he can do it. Contracts are there to be respected. [reporter 2, in Catalan] However, the Barcelona candidates don't believe it. [in Catalan] Figo hasn't authorized any contract to be signed on his behalf. But if they're reckless enough, and I'm sure they're not, uh, to sign any kind of document, then that contract is completely illegal. [in Catalan] I'll explain it very quickly for those who haven't read MARCA. It says that on 1st July, a document was signed between Veiga and Florentino Pérez. Mr. Gaspart says this document is illegal, but MARCA editors claim they've seen Veiga's signature. The worst thing about the Luís Figo saga, which is where the word "betrayal" comes into it, is that, according to Figo, Veiga signed a contract without his knowledge. I don't believe him. How can an agent do that without the verbal consent of his player? Luís Figo has denied this contract for a long time, and in his version of events, he claims he didn't know anything, that it was something his agent had done, and he had no knowledge of that contract. What precontract? Look, all I can tell you is my truth. Um… I think that the only person who can really respond to this is José, who is the one that, theoretically, signed the contract. The only thing I did was say to José, "Look, you talk to whoever you need to, and then we can decide if this is real or not." So I honestly don't know if anyone signed a contract because I never saw it. [interviewer] Was there a precontract? There was, yes. -[interviewer] Did you sign it? -Yes, I signed it. -[interviewer] Did Figo sign it? -No. No, Figo didn't sign it. He was unable to. [interviewer] Did Figo ask you to sign the contract? Yes. One thing is me telling him to speak to people, but it's another thing if he signs something on my behalf. If he signed it, then he was making the commitment, and he was taking the risks in this situation. Because he didn't really have any way of making me responsible for a situation like this. [Veiga] It's not in my interest to lie. Twenty-one years have gone by. But I think now's the time for me to tell my side of the story. Luís Figo never saw that contract. He never saw it. Florentino Pérez never had a copy. There was only one version of it. And before signing the contract, I called Luís Figo and read him out the contract in full. And I asked him, "Luís, can I sign it?" And Luís replied, "Yes, you can." So I signed it. It was impossible for me to sign any document without the consent of the player, be it Figo or anyone else. Impossible. [reporter, in Spanish] Lorenzo Sanz doesn't believe it. For the time being, he's demanding respect for the Real Madrid squad and thinks Figo's agent, José Veiga, should not be trusted. [in Spanish] It's a worthless piece of paper. He doesn't know football. If you trust an agent capable of signing contracts with different clubs… Juve, Parma… it seems to me you don't understand football. 5 YEARS EARLIER [commentator speaking in Portuguese] [Veiga] I met him when he was 16 or 17. We started to work together then. Luís Figo was already at such a high level that his future was destined to be abroad. [reporter, in Portuguese] A Portuguese name in the news, and it's Sporting Lisbon player Luís Figo, in a tug-of-war between Parma and Juventus. Figo's departure from Sporting is a real soap opera, and it's still not known where the player will end up. We're talking about the '90s, and Italian football was the best in the world. So every player wanted to play in Italy. [in Portuguese] Figo signed for Parma this morning, in an office here in Lisbon. [reporter 2, in Portuguese] By midday, he'd signed on the dotted line, and the handshakes see him join the club for the next three years. Parma has beaten Juventus, at least in winning Figo over. But Juventus didn't give up, and they signed an agreement with Luís Figo. [Portuguese] Parma and Juventus are trying to determine Figo's final destination. It was a tough meeting, on a day the paper O Jogo revealed fresh accusations against the player's agent, José Veiga. They convinced him to sign the agreement without me knowing. [reporter 3, in Portuguese] Veiga slipped up in a recent letter. First he refers to the document signed between Figo and Juventus as an "agreement." But in the second paragraph, he refers to it as a "contract." The agent unintentionally recognized that Figo, instead of signing a pre-agreement, had signed a real contract with Turin. The contradictions are obvious. [reporter in Portuguese] Are you aware that Juventus could put pressure on the authorities, and you'll be unable to play in Italy? Are you aware of this? [in Portuguese] No, because I only signed a valid contract with Parma. -[reporter] Are you sure? -As far as I know, that's the case. -Did you sign a contract with Juventus? -I didn't. I signed an agreement. I've already said this several times. Uh, the only contract I had was with my agent, and I'll honor it. [anchor, in Portuguese] Juventus and Parma have given up on signing Luís Figo. The two clubs met with the Italian Football Federation, and the player is banned from playing in Italy for the next two years. [in Portuguese] Banned from playing in Italy for two years, he must be loaned by Parma to another club, possibly in Spain. [in Portuguese] Luís Figo is already in Barcelona. The Portuguese player arrived in the Catalan capital yesterday. [reporter, in Portuguese] Champagne and olés all round for Barça's new star, greeted by a legion of fans. 7 DAYS TO THE ELECTIONS [telephone rings, clicks] [Figo, in Spanish] Hello! I'm busy at the moment, possibly doing something more interesting. Oops! Leave a message after the beep. Thanks. [in Spanish] Luís Figo has become the focal point of the Real Madrid elections. Pérez hasn't confirmed or denied having an agreement with the player. And Figo, who we were with this morning in the Algarve, also doesn't deny the news. [Figo, in Spanish] Sorry you guys came all this way, but I don't have anything to say. [reporter, in Spanish] Can you confirm or deny the news? No. Sorry. Sorry. [Futre] I was always by his side. I was with him in the Algarve every day, calming him down. And trying to keep him positive. I'd had dinner with him the night before. I'd been with him, and he didn't say a word. I wake up, and when I switch on my phone, my inbox is full of messages. From Florentino Pérez, José Veiga… [electronic beep] [Futre] "Paulo…" [echoes] [electronic beeping] FIGO DENIES EVERYTHING [in Spanish] In an interview with the Catalan newspaper SPORT, Figo says he will stay with Barça. Total madness on this Sunday during the campaign. [reporter 1, in Spanish] Figo's bombshell has forced the candidates to take unexpected measures. Florentino Pérez had to stop by his tent to try to explain the Portuguese player's statement. Lorenzo Sanz bumped up his flight from Barcelona to attend a press conference at his campaign headquarters. [in Spanish] He must realize now that he can't keep lying, and this is now falling apart for him. [in Spanish] Do I look worried? I am calm. Relax. "Tranquil," as the Catalonians say. REAL MADRID PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN FLORENTINO PÉREZ [Veiga] When this interview came out, Florentino Pérez called me. "José, what's this interview about?" "How can this be possible? This can't happen." "We're in the middle of an election. What's going on?" And I calmed him down. "No, Florentino, it's all good." "There's no problem. It's just pressure coming from Barcelona." "Don't worry. It's all going well." And Florentino said, "That's all well and good, but now he has to do an interview with MARCA." 6 DAYS TO THE ELECTIONS [anchor, in Spanish] The Figo case continues to grab headlines. Today, MARCA published a story that contradicts yesterday's SPORT piece. FLORENTINO HAS HIM SIGNED FIGO: THE WHOLE TRUTH On MARCA's front page, he said, "If he wins, who knows what will happen?" He'd said he would never wear the Real Madrid shirt, and then the next day, he said, "Maybe." [reporter, in Spanish] Tomorrow, Florentino Pérez will address the issue. But in the meantime, who should we trust? [in Spanish] Personally, I trust MARCA. Without a shadow of a doubt. Poor Luís Figo. He's been under a lot of pressure this week. It wouldn't shock me if he loses it a bit. I don't pay attention to rumors. Tomorrow, I'll talk about my plans, and I'll also talk about Luís Figo, and I'd like it to be the last time. 5 DAYS TO THE ELECTIONS THIS IS HOW MADRID WINS [Pérez, in Spanish] I would ask that the members not talk about this issue anymore. If I become president of Real Madrid, Luís Figo will be a Real Madrid player. And to underline how confident I am, if I am elected president and this doesn't happen, I will pay the membership fees for every member next season. [crowd applauds, whistles] [Díaz] This was the moment when all Real Madrid members were saying, "This is actually serious. It's real." "And here's a president who can make us dream more than the other guy, who'd just won two Champions Leagues." [crowd applauds, cheers, whistles] [Sanz, in Spanish] We'll see tomorrow when Mr. Figo denies it again, and I hope this time it'll be definitive that he's staying with Barcelona and that he apologizes to the members. [reporter, in Spanish] Lorenzo Sanz's team is ready to counter the Figo effect, and there's nothing better than showing Figo at his most Barcelona. All members will receive a copy of this video. [chants in Spanish] Madrid crybabies! Bow down to the champions! Madrid crybabies! Bow down to the champions! Long live Barça! [crowd cheering] [in Spanish] As his teammate, as a fan, knowing how great a footballer he is, I hope he stays at Barcelona. That's what me and all the fans hope for. Obviously, it's his decision, and he needs time to think it through. I know him, and I know he doesn't take these decisions lightly. We talked about it, and I gave him my opinion as a friend. He said he had to think about it. That he'd had an offer from Madrid, and he'd take a look at it. I definitely tried to convince him to stay. That there was no better place to be. That the people here loved him. And he knew it. And that he'd be a unique and once-in-a-lifetime player here. [stopwatch ticking] [Guardiola] Barcelona's a city he loved. [interviewer, in Spanish] Why's Barça more than a club? If you think that it is. [chuckles] [in Spanish] Yes, when you're here, you realize it is… SPEAKING IN 1999 …because of the affection of the people. I believe that, uh, a club can't just, uh, be about sports. I feel like I'm at home, uh, with a family. Also, because of the club's past during Franco's dictatorship. And so, for all those reasons, uh, you can say that it's more than a club. [narrator, in English] Barcelona, capital of Catalonia, suffers its last bombardment before capture by Franco's army. [Guardiola] When speaking Catalan was banned in Barcelona during the Franco era, and our language was persecuted, the Nou Camp was a place where you could express yourself with total freedom. For me, it's clear, Barça's more than a club. Barça is a Catalan club. Very pro-Catalonia. Rooted in the region. In our land. And it obviously brings together who we are and what we represent, which is our country and our feelings. This is why the symbolism of what Barça means to Catalonia, and vice versa, cannot be separated. And as a football club, it's one of the biggest. For some of us, it is the biggest. [commentator speaking in Spanish] [commentator shouts enthusiastically] [commentator speaking in Catalan] [commentator yelling passionately] [commentator speaking in Spanish] Barcelona being more than a club means just that. We're representatives of a very specific way of being, which is against centralism. So, if Real Madrid represents centralism, then the conditions are perfect for the rivalry. [interviewer, in Spanish] You know that the Catalan people express their feelings through this club to Spain and the rest of the world. That's how we express Catalan nationalism. What do you think about this? From the outside, from my point of view, it's a way to reclaim, um, a way of life, a way of thinking, for the people of Catalonia. Since I arrived at the club, I've always felt supported. I think I owe the people a debt of gratitude. We're a family! [crowd cheers raucously] -[in Catalan] Long live Barça! -[crowd cheers] Long live Catalonia! [air horns honk enthusiastically] [Figo, present] I identified with the values of the club. I defended them to the death. I was seen as one of them. 2 DAYS TO THE ELECTIONS [in Spanish] We have exclusive footage shot by a TeleMadrid camera of an event that occurred this afternoon at Hotel Meliá Castilla. In it, Florentino Pérez is meeting with José Veiga, the agent of the Portuguese player who Madrid fans would love to see join but who still belongs to Barcelona. This is a preview of the meeting. Listen to what Veiga says. [in Spanish] We hope Florentino wins. If he wins, we'll be here on Monday. [anchor] "If Florentino wins, we'll be here on Monday." He's referring to himself and his client, Luís Figo. [Veiga, present] I felt Florentino was very confident. And he knew if he could deliver Figo, he'd win the elections. But Luís had many doubts. He felt that staying in Barcelona could be for the best. It was really tough. [in Spanish] We don't want him here. He can go. They can pay his buyout clause. [in Spanish] He's a mercenary. He can go to hell. Got that? Period. [Figo, chants softly in Spanish] We're in Sardinia! We've come to spend a few days here. [Figo] Throughout the process, there were moments of doubt. Of thinking "yes," then thinking "no." There were a lot of threats, a lot of pressure, a lot of nasty statements and stories, not just against me but against my family. Switching to play for your archrivals is not an easy decision. [phone ringing] [woman and child softly singing] [man] Luís Figo called me to say, "We have to put an end to all the rumors because it's really damaging for me." "I'm getting crucified in Barcelona, and I'd like to clear a few things up." -[Figo laughs] -[child, in Spanish] Yes! [Frieros] SPORT travelled to Sardinia, to the Romazzino Hotel on the Costa Smeralda. Nobody held a gun to his head. He was free to say and do what he thought best. And he was convinced that he'd stay at Barcelona whether Florentino won or lost. [dramatic electronic music plays] NO TO MADRID "I WILL STAY WITH BARÇA…" [Frieros] "It has come to the point, driven by the circumstances, when he can no longer remain indifferent." "Figo wants to put an end to the summer soap opera." "'You won't go to Real Madrid?'" "'No, I won't go.'" "'You'll stay at Barça?'" "'That's always been my intention, my desire, and my hope, since the beginning.'" "'I will not leave Barça.'" "'That is my final decision.'" "Luís Figo picks up a Barça shirt." "It's his. The number seven." "He puts it on, and the matter is closed." "THIS IS AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE MY SHIRT" I'm convinced that if he said he'd stay, it's because he thought he'd stay. I don't think it's a case of him saying, "I'm going to Real Madrid, but I'm going to say I'll stay when I know I'm not." That's not very smart, and Luís is a clever guy. [interviewer] When you were pictured in a Barça shirt, did you really believe you were staying? Yes, at the time, I thought so. I thought that was going to happen. That's why I did it. [stopwatch ticking] ELECTION DAY [dramatic electronic music plays] [unheard dialogue] -[in Spanish] I've not slept at all. -[Spanish reporter] You couldn't sleep? -Did you try? -Not at all. -[reporter] Did you shower? -I did take a shower. [indistinct chatter] [in Spanish] Now onto sports news. Real Madrid remains in the spotlight. -We're joined by Roberto Gómez. -[in Spanish] Hello, everyone, Isabel. Yes, Real Madrid is in the spotlight because the club has a new president. [stopwatch ticking] [dramatic electronic music plays] [interviewer] The story of this transfer is one where everyone claims to be telling the truth. Who do you think is telling the actual truth? I am. Because I'm the protagonist. Everything that I tell you is what happened. [unheard dialogue] [in Spanish] Between us, we'll ensure that the name of this club is synonymous with greatness. Because its history deserves it, its members deserve it, as do the millions of supporters in this city, in Spain, and all over the world. Thank you very much. [reporter, in Spanish] Florentino will start work today. Real Madrid members now await the arrival of Luís Figo. [Pérez] I've always been a calm person. I think about what it is I have to do. If I really want something, I'm safe in the knowledge that I'll get it done. They were crazy times. I'd just won the elections. I had to plan and organize everything. All the media were talking about Figo, and I think Figo felt a bit overwhelmed. But I was so sure that Figo was coming to Real Madrid, I didn't give it much thought. Players join Real Madrid because they want to. I was convinced Figo wanted to come to the club. [interviewer] You didn't have doubts at any point? No. I didn't have any doubts. [in Spanish] Now let's see the sports headlines. SPORT, "Barça fans ask, 'What's going to happen?'" "Barça supporter or traitor?" AS, "Figo bunkers down in Sardinia. Hounded." [phone ringing] Florentino won the elections in Madrid, and everyone who was involved in the operation, which included my agent, tried to persuade me to make the move. [phone ringing] So Veiga calls Figo, who's in Sardinia. That's when Luís said, "I'll never go to Real Madrid." [in Portuguese] "Never ever." "I'm not going. I'm not going. I'm not going." Then Luís tells Veiga not to call him again. "Leave me alone. Don't call me again." "You won't convince me!" [cell phone rings] [De la Morena] I thought this could fall through at any moment, that Barça could take action. But I talked with Florentino, and he told me that it was a done deal. I said, "But it could fail at the last minute." "No, it won't, because I've added a €30 million penalty clause." "And if he wants out of the deal, he'd have to pay Real Madrid €30 million." Fuck. [Pérez] I'd never signed anything like that before, I can assure you. This was in 2000. I haven't done anything like that again since then. It was, let's say, a motivational clause and nothing else. Figo never signed it. It was a contract that Veiga and I signed, which could be seen more as a declaration of intent because José Veiga didn't have the authority to sign anything on Figo's behalf. [Futre] It was the final clause. [unheard dialogue] [Futre] I glanced over it. [unheard dialogue] And if Luís kept saying to Veiga that he wasn't going to Real Madrid, we had a very big problem. A colossal problem. And this caused José Veiga a lot of stress as his name was on the contract. Someone had to pay the €30 million. [in Portuguese] "I'm not going. I'm not going." I said to José, "We've only got one solution." "Only one." "Not two." "And that's to hire a private jet." -This is Figo's agent. -[man] He is? You're a MARCA reporter. You need to pay attention. [indistinct dialogue] [Futre, present] At 4 or 5 a.m., we left for Sardinia. After that, the nightmare really began. [Veiga] He was at the Hotel Romazzino. I called him and said, "We're in the lobby." That was at 9 a.m. [interviewer] When they phoned and said they were there, what did you think? "What are these guys doing here?" [Veiga] I could feel a lot of tension. His wife, Helen, was really upset. Luís was restless and uneasy. [Figo, present] José knew all about the agreement he'd signed. But it was his agreement. He was aware of the mess he'd got himself into. So they were there to make me take full responsibility. That's why they came. [Futre] "I can't go to Real Madrid. I can't. My life, my family… I can't." It was like that all day. All day long. First in the restaurant and then on the beach. The beach! We go to the beach. We've got our suits and ties on. "Paulo, why are we on the beach?" So we followed them to the beach in our suits. I was told, "Go to Sardinia to find Figo." "Okay." I went with a colleague. A photographer. So he'd turn up on the beach every now and then, but it was so tense because, at that point, there were still stories in the news saying that he was going to reject this contract. [Futre] And that day was terrible. Terrible. Really hard. I said to him, "Okay, Luís, I understand." "But if you don't go, someone will have to pay €30 million to Real Madrid." It was the €30 million abyss. How do you get out of it? How do you get out of this hole? I say to Luís, "Let's do this…" "Let's get a private jet to Lisbon." "We'll meet Florentino there, we'll apologize, you'll get to know him." "And you can tell him that you don't wanna play for Real Madrid." "If you want, we can have a drink in the city and get the plane back." And then we went to the hotel where we'd been told Figo was staying. The first person to see me was Futre. He said, "Félix! What are you doing here? Get outta here!" "If Figo sees you, he'll kill you. Please!" Because Figo was about to leave and catch a private jet to Lisbon because he still wasn't sure about playing for Real Madrid. [Veiga] We all met in Lisbon. We got to my office, and Florentino Pérez was there with his staff. [Pérez] I told him about my plan, that I wanted to develop a whole sporting project around him. I told him the best players in the world were going to come. That we wanted to create a magical Madrid in line with its history. For me, he was the cornerstone on which I'd develop the whole project. [Futre] At this point, Luís was very close to being won over. I remember saying to him, "Speak to Helen. Call Helen." [Figo] Everyone was gathered there, trying to convince me I tried to listen to everyone. Then I called my wife. At two or three in the morning, I think it was, and I woke her up and said, "Look. I'm going to Madrid." He started speaking to Helen, in English. And he was just saying, "Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes…" When the call ended, he said, "No, I can't. I can't sign it." And then Florentino said to him, "You'll be my star." "I want you at Real Madrid, Luís." "I don't want €30 million. I want you." "I want to build the best team in the world. I want you." [Figo] I was the one with everything to lose because I had my life set up in Barcelona. For me, it started as a lack of consideration, given what I meant to the club, what I gave to the club, and what I'd done for the club. I wanted to play football in a place where I'd be appreciated. That's what convinced me to join Real Madrid. The main reason I left was because they valued me and genuinely wanted me. In the end, I thought about myself. Uh… Was it selfish? Maybe. Did I earn more money? Yes. But I think if I'd stayed at Barcelona, I would have earned the same. These are important moments when you have to think about yourself. [Veiga] It was already dawn, the sun was rising, and Luís signed. -[crowd applauds] -["Cant del Barça" plays] 5 DAYS LATER So the day came when I became president. I became president at 9 p.m. And I went to celebrate. [jovial classical music plays] [Gaspart] Everyone was happy because we'd won. Luís Figo then calls me on the phone. [phone rings] [music distorts and fades] [phone rings] [Gaspart] He said, "Hi, Joan. Congratulations." "Thank you very much." So far, fine. I said, "When are you arriving?" He said, "That depends on you." And this is where the betrayal comes into it. He said, "I've got two tickets." "One's from Lisbon to Madrid, and the other's Lisbon to Barcelona." "Whether I'll be using the Barcelona ticket depends on you." I said, "What does it depend on?" JULY 24, MONDAY [Gaspart, in Spanish] "You have to give me a bank guarantee for 500 million pesetas." BARÇA SUPPORTER OR TRAITOR? "Then tomorrow, you'll pick me up at the airport and make a huge public statement as the new president that Figo is staying at Barça." [jovial classical music resumes] [Gaspart] I said, "Look, Luís, it's midnight." "I can't give you a bank guarantee now." [unheard dialogue] "You're asking me for the impossible." "I'm off to Madrid, then." "Okay. Good luck. Have a nice trip." "What do you want me to say?" That thing about, "I've got two tickets, one for Madrid, one for Barcelona," that's not something I made up. He said it. If he tells the truth, not a lie, the truth, I'll ask the Barça members to forgive him, and we can forget all about the Luís Figo affair. [interviewer] Gaspart said in several interviews that you called him the night he won the elections in Barcelona, and you told him you had two tickets, one for Barcelona and one for Madrid. That's a lie. A lie. A lie. Barça! Barça! [anchor, in Spanish] Mr. Gaspart, this must be a very happy day for you. Your first as president of Barcelona. But I'm going to sour it a little because I'm going to ask about Luís Figo. What do you have to say? [in Spanish] From what I know, Luís Figo has signed a contract with Real Madrid. If that's true, if Luís Figo has actually signed this contract, then there's nothing to be done, and unfortunately, Figo may now be a Real Madrid player. But at what price? [Spanish reporter 1] He's the man of the hour, the Portuguese star Luís Figo… [Spanish reporter 2] Luís Figo is already in Madrid, and this evening he'll be presented at Bernabéu… [French reporter] He's signing a six-year contract with archenemies Real Madrid… [Portuguese reporter] …making it the most expensive transfer in the world. [Spanish reporter 3] Money is a powerful figure, capable of making possible what seemed impossible. [Figo] We hadn't even returned to Barcelona after the Euros because I'd gone on holiday, and I never went back. From there, I went straight to the presentation. [Spanish paparazzo 1] Don't worry about it. Of course I'm gonna go for it. [paparazzo 2 curses in Spanish] -[paparazzo 2] Go for it. Get the picture! -[car horn honks] [car accelerates] [paparazzo 2] We're the only ones following him. [paparazzo 1] Screw this guy. Get right next to him. Just get right next to him. Fuck this dickhead. -He can go fuck himself. -[paparazzo 2] Shit. [paparazzo 1 swears profusely] [Díaz] It was a small room. It was really hot. People running after him all day, "Where's Figo?" Chasing after him. And suddenly, the scene in that small room was Di Stéfano and Florentino Pérez, with a shirt. Di Stéfano was happy. Florentino was glowing. But Figo… [unheard dialogue] [unheard dialogue] [in Spanish] Good evening, everyone. For me, it's hugely satisfying to be in this wonderful place, surrounded by so many trophies won by Real Madrid throughout its history. And to be here with our honorary president, Don Alfredo Di Stéfano. Above all, I'm here to present to you, and this is my first act of presentation, one of the best players in the world, Luís Figo. Luís, I'd like to welcome you to the club that will become your home. You'll be delighted to have made this decision, and the fans will no doubt love you… -[journalists talking in Spanish] -[people shushing loudly] …just as the board of directors love you. Thank you very much, Luís. [applause erupts] [Figo] In a moment like this, you think so many things. So many things are going through your head. Maybe you shut out how you really feel. To make that decision and suddenly be presented in Madrid, built up a well of emotions. I wasn't in the frame of mind to express my happiness. I was there but wasn't there. So many things happened all at once, and they can make you… um… Not crush you, but… they affect you. I'M HERE FIGO, TRAITOR! [in Spanish] We wish him all the best, especially those of us who know him and love him. If it's his-- it's his decision, then I think it's perfect because it's his life. We lose an irreplaceable player with immense talent. We just wish him all the best. It made me sad, I'm not gonna lie. I'd have preferred Luís to stay with me, not just on the pitch but off it too, in the dressing room. I know we spoke in the following day or days, and I wished him luck and told him that I'd miss him, and I really did, for many years, and that's that. [dramatic electronic music plays] I can't speak for Barça, but I felt like I'd been stabbed like a bull in a ring. It tore me apart. [in Spanish] Figo is leaving Barça because he wants to. I hope he doesn't look for any excuses. He should be brave. And he should say that money is everything in life. I understand that, and that's fair. As long as he says it and is not ashamed for wanting more and more and more. Joan Gaspart will not forget this. [man speaking in Spanish] [man, in Spanish] Cheer up, Figo! You'll be better off here than in Barcelona! This is the best city in the world. Champion! Good luck! All the best for your future. [photographer, in Spanish] Let's see! Good morning. [Figo, in Spanish] I always respect other people's opinions, so people have to respect my decision whether they like it or not. Uh, they call me a traitor but, um, maybe the people who call me a traitor are the ones who betrayed me. I'm focused on being here and doing the best I can to represent this club. 3 MONTHS LATER [anchor, in Spanish] All these seats that you're currently seeing are going to be filled. A hundred thousand people will be at the Nou Camp. It's sold out. So it's Barça versus Real Madrid, or maybe it's more appropriate to say the game is really Barça against Figo. [Spanish journalist 1] Does Luís think people in Barcelona will forgive him? [Spanish journalist 2] All I'm saying is they're going to boo Figo. They'll boo him a lot because of how he left. [Spanish reporter 3] The Nou Camp is wounded and ready to condemn the man who left for the place that hurts the fans most. [Valdano] I don't think Figo quite realized the full scale of what was about to happen. Hatred from fans is directly proportional to the love they feel for a player. And Figo was adored in Barcelona. [photographer speaking in Spanish] [reporter, in Spanish] 600 reporters, 200 from abroad. All of whom will bear witness to Luís Figo's return to the Nou Camp. [man, in Spanish] He doesn't realize what he did to Barça fans. But he's screwed if he wants to play football tonight. [in Spanish] We're not allowed to throw anything. But if I could, I'd throw a rock at his head. [in Spanish] Joan, you seem very tense, while Florentino, you seem completely relaxed. [in Spanish] That's down to our personalities. You know that I take these games very seriously and passionately because we have to admit this rivalry goes back a long way. And, however much we have lunch together, that's not going to change. Well, there you have it. What you see here is cordiality. Let's see how things are in 5 hours and 30 minutes. [tense electronic music plays] [indistinct dialogue] [in Portuguese] "Traitor, Judas, mercenary." These insults are the least Figo can expect from Barça fans. [in Spanish] Just a plea that nothing serious happens. [in Spanish] We speak about Figo as if he's public enemy number one. [in Spanish] No, sorry, he's not a criminal, but he is a traitor! [journalist, in Spanish] Don't take a photo with the shirt. Don't say, "I'm not leaving!" [angrily] That's what he shouldn't have done! -[man laughing] -[in Spanish] Figo, you son of a bitch! [laughter continues] Where's Figo? Where's Figo? Figo? Where's Figo? Where's Figo? Where's Figo? You're a mercenary! -[rider shouting expletives in Spanish] -[men laughing] [chanting, in Spanish] Figo, you bastard! Your girlfriend is a whore! Figo, you bastard! Your girlfriend is a whore! FIGO MERCENARY [unheard dialogue] [people chanting angrily] [people whistling shrilly] FIGO = TRAITOR, LIAR, AND MONEY-GRUBBER FIGO, YOU WOULD SELL YOUR MOM IF YOU KNEW WHO SHE WAS [crowd cheering raucously] To be honest, it was one of those games that when I went out to warm up, if the referee had said he was cancelling the match, I'd have been delighted. NEW CURRENCY NOTE [Spanish anchor] It's an intimidating atmosphere at Nou Camp. You can feel the tension in the stadium. Obviously, because of the SPORT front page and all of those things, people felt bad. They felt hurt and deceived. But at the end of the day, people have to understand that everyone has the right to make their own choices, but things went too far, a line was crossed, and what happened happened. [cacophonous roar of crowd] [Valdano] It was impossible not to have been affected when it came down to the football because the atmosphere was unbearable. I've never seen anything like it. [Barça fans, chanting in Spanish] Figo, you should die! [Barça fans roar angrily] [commentator 1, in Spanish] Listen to the welcome the Madrid players are getting. [commentator 2, in Spanish] I can't remember an atmosphere as rough as this one. Watch out! This could explode at any moment! [Barça fans booing angrily] [announcer] …Raúl, Figo… [Barça fans roar aggressively] [interviewer] Did anyone suggest to Figo not to play that day? No. [tutting] Firstly, because we weren't in a position to tell him what to do. Secondly, everyone who knows Luís knew he wouldn't listen anyway. That would be cowardly. That would be giving in. That would be giving in to the people that were attacking me. [spectators roar] [commentator 1] Figo is looking quite serious. What a test this is! [Barça fans, chanting] Portuguese son of a bitch! [crowd roars] FIGO, TRAITOR WELCOME TO HELL [Barça fans, chanting] Figo, you bastard! Your girlfriend is a whore! Figo, you bastard! Your girlfriend is a whore! Figo, die already! Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! [commentator talking excitedly in Spanish] -[air horns honking] -[Barça fans chanting] [commentator 1] There we go again with fans throwing things. [commentary continues] [whistle blows] [Portuguese commentator] There goes the final whistle. Barça, 2-0. [Figo] The fans reacted the way they did because the press really stirred things up. YOU BETRAYED US [Figo] It was no longer a question of being angry at a transfer… which I could understand. It was a personal attack and against my family. So after that, I drew a line. I've had it. It's over. 10,000 PESETAS MERCENARY -[melancholic piano plays] -[fans, chanting] Figo! Figo! Figo! Figo! [Figo] With all that happened at Madrid, I can say with 100% conviction that it was the right decision to join the club. [speaking French] [Figo] In 2000, I won the Ballon d'Or. To win that trophy was crazy. [commentator speaking in Spanish] [commentator shouting enthusiastically] [Figo] In my first year, with all the pressure I was under, we won the league. Second year, we won the Champions League. [piano music continues] [Figo] We won everything. I don't know if I changed the rivalry. It will always be there. But did anything change within Spanish football? Yes, it did. Because it was the first major transfer in world football. It also changed the cycle of victory. Was that down to my move? I don't know. But the record shows that the cycle changed, because Barcelona then went five years without winning anything. [speaking Spanish] [Gaspart] Barça lost their best player, and Madrid suddenly had the best player in Spanish football at that time. [Spanish reporter] Have you forgotten the whole Figo thing? -[Spanish] We've not discussed the matter. -[Pérez laughs] [indistinct dialogue] [Gaspart] I admire Florentino Pérez tremendously as a person. But as president of Real Madrid, he's my sworn enemy and a man who played a dirty trick that left me with a mandate that ended very badly. JOAN GASPART RESIGNED AS PRESIDENT OF FC BARCELONA IN 2003 [spectators, chanting in Spanish] Gaspart out! Gaspart out! Gaspart out! [Gaspart] He's still the president of Madrid, and I was one of the worst presidents in Barça's history. [man 1] Florentino! [man 2] Floren! Florentino! LUÍS FIGO WAS THE FIRST OF FLORENTINO PÉREZ'S "GALÁCTICOS" [Pérez] I think we made a bold statement and said, "Let's do something big." And then I think that the world of football changed, without a shadow of a doubt. PÉREZ IS STILL PRESIDENT OF REAL MADRID AND IS NOW SPEARHEADING THE EUROPEAN SUPER LEAGUE Whenever I see him, I say, "Figo, it all started with you!" [muffled dialogue] [Futre] I'll never forget the conversation I had with Luís. I told him, "I've been retired for a year and a half." "The Portuguese Federation still haven't invited me to a game." "Not even to a friendly. Nothing." "Why am I telling you this? Because at the end of the day, what counts isn't the medals, the Ballon d'Or, the Bola de Prata." "It isn't even the Champions League." "At the end of the day, what's important is the money." "The money that you make." PAULO FUTRE MADE 1.5 MILLION EUROS FOR HIS ROLE IN THE TRANSFER JOSÉ VEIGA MADE 3 MILLION EUROS FOR HIS PART [Guardiola] If we knew how to find happiness, we'd go find it. We'd go straight there. You make a decision because you feel it's best for you and your family. Who's anyone to tell you otherwise? [crowd cheers enthusiastically] Would I have liked him to stay? Of course. Not just me but a lot of people at the club, in Barcelona and all over Catalonia. Well, he chose to leave. I wished him luck. I know he was happy, and that's all that matters. BETWEEN 2008 AND 2012, PEP GUARDIOLA WENT ON TO BECOME BARCELONA'S MOST SUCCESSFUL COACH EVER [Figo] If you were to ask me now who I'd prefer to be more successful, I'd say Madrid. [English commentator] Zidane. Makélélé! [shouting] It's come for Figo! Luís Figo breaks Barcelona hearts all over again! LUÍS FIGO PLAYED FOR REAL MADRID UNTIL 2005 HE STILL LIVES IN MADRID WITH HIS FAMILY CATALONIA DOESN'T FORGET. JUDA$!! [Figo] Throughout my career I've made a lot of mistakes. That's normal. I'm not perfect, and I don't want to be. But I didn't make those mistakes to hurt anyone. Maybe I hurt myself with a lot of them because I couldn't say no. Uh… But I try not to have regrets because I don't think they're of any use. ["Hala Madrid!" by José de Aguilar plays quietly] [music becoming gradually louder] [music stops]
