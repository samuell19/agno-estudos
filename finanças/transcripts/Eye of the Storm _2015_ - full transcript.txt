For more than 20 years, the northern areas have been occupied by an armed group. The army didn't manage to take those areas back or stop the massacre. Nothing has changed in the capital in 20 years... Department of Justice Penitentiary Security Service EYE OF THE STORM And now, the election. The President of the Republic has pulled out in favor of his son, who is now the new candidate... - Unbelievable! We'll get stuck with his son for 30 more years! - That man is insane. - Outrageous. His son is a crook! Hell no! Courthouse Why is there a hole instead of a heart? Because he was hurt, too. Can I take a look at your back? I won't touch you. He does look sad. No, it's not that. That's a tattoo. We all have one in the South. Three dots for boys, four dots for girls. Who did this to you? Your husband? A doctor is going to see this. I'll take care of the rest. It won't happen again, sweetie. Never again. I'm sorry, madam. Ms. Tou, the president wants to see you. Lawyers Bar Association Go ahead. Ah! My darling! - How are you? - Good. How are your parents? Take a seat. Ms. Tou, we're not going to lose any time here. Would you plead a case at the criminal court? - The court has been closed. - Precisely. It will reopen for the case I'm telling you about. - See what I mean? - The rebel? He needs a big lawyer. They have all refused. The election is near. Neither the president nor the opposition will get their hands dirty with the rebels. What are the charges? The charges are heavy. And he hasn't said a word since he was arrested. We don't even know what language he speaks. - Was he evaluated by a psychiatrist? - No, and he won't be. The government wants him to go to court. That's all. I thought you would be happy. Emma, I'm offering you the trial of the century. Thank you, but no. It's too political for me. Very well. So much for that. However, you'll do me a favor. He's a civilian. He must be informed about the reasons for his arrest. You're going to read him his rights. In the meantime, I'll find him a lawyer. That won't change my decision. Ah! Ms. Tou. Well, tell me. Did you take the case? - Solo, mind your own business. - No, wait... - Mr. Abdul, this is for you. - Thanks. You have to sign. He has nothing to do here. He's mad. He'll bring me trouble. The prisoners are upset. They want to kill him. 5,000 people in there. I'm not his attorney. Sit down. She's with me. Go ahead if you want, but he needs to go. No jewelry. He's not normal. He grumbles, he dribbles... He is mentally ill! Madam, I can't take him to the visiting room. We'll have to go to the high-security area. This is chief guard Bako. - He'll come with you. - Thank you. We'll cross the yard. Hold your purse against you. Do not listen to them. Most importantly, do not answer them. Don't give them anything. Otherwise, they'll wreak havoc and we'll lose control. Alright? I'm sick. I need money! I've been here for 2 years! High-Security Area Tell Boukson to give me the cigarette! Madam, they have no right! They had a fight over some cigarettes. We have 2 injured. I'm going to die! Pull down your panties! Is that a man? He's here because he cut his lovers' testicles. He did it to himself. - Mine is bigger. Look. - Shut the fuck up! The most dangerous inmates are kept here. Stay behind the door. You can talk through the hatch. Hello! I am Ms. Tou, lawyer. I'm here to read you your rights. You have a right to a lawyer. Do you speak French? I'll now read your charges: - "Aggravated assault and battery". - We have to go. - "Possession of weapons of war". - Miss, we need to go now. Thank you all for being here. We're gathered here today to celebrate a very happy moment. On behalf of the President and myself, I wish you a very happy birthday, dear Albert. Thank you for everything you've done for this country. Have a very happy birthday. You look beautiful, honey. - Is there anyone you like? - Please, Dad. Don't start. I have to ask. I would like to be a grandfather someday. The Bar asked me to defend the rebel. You didn't...? No! But it was flattering. - What is it? - Nothing. Look at him. Always working out deals with the accused. No wonder he's put some weight on. Lydie loves him. You should see the castle he built for himself. It looks like a cake in the middle of huts. So, is this the single ladies club? Fuck you, Roc. Ouch! That hurt! Tell me, did the president tell you about the rebel? He's asked every lawyer in town. He didn't call you? Don't tell me he didn't. Emma Tou in the lions' cage! Were you scared? "Aggravated assault and battery. Possession of weapons of war. "Resistance to authority..." Open the door. He can't hear me. You'll have to let us in first. That guy can kill you with two fingers. Lawyer. There are serious charges against you. Crimes against national security. Criminal and terrorist organization. Accessory to first-degree murder for the death of 65 people. It's easy to spot the three dots of the tattoo. That's important. What is a guy from the South doing in the liberation front? That must be cleared up. Add that point to the file. You know that only the defense attorney can participate in the inquiry. You gave me a mission, I accomplished it. Now, please excuse me. - Miss... - I refused the case. I have a cousin who drives an ambulance. He evacuated the rebel. Go to see him. That's all I'm asking. - Talk to his lawyer. - What lawyer? Everybody's scared. I know you. You will raise your voice for justice! - This trial is set before hand. - Exactly. It's your chance to surprise them with a good defense. Aren't you scared? - No. - Why not? I'm a good student. I'll be a lawyer in two months. But they use me as a mail carrier because I'm poor. I just want to be a lawyer and do my job. That's all. They're going to execute him. We can't let them do that. This investigation is outrageous indeed. Come on, miss! Aren't you curious to know why they didn't kill that one? It was over. He was caught sacking the village. He was taken in real quick. They beat him savagely. He allegedly shot two soldiers that tried to catch him. Two people were shot. I saw a guy with a torn ear. He was screaming like a pig. We had to attach him. They wanted to finish him off. Another one was hurt in the leg. - The white man gave him first aid. - Wait. What white man? There was a white doctor in a Red Cross outfit. He's not mentioned. What was the Red Cross doing there? Solo, I'll tell you only because it's you. I'm not supposed to talk. What if we need you at the trial? I'm leaving with the UN. It's good money. I won't get mixed up in this. Tell the old lady I'll come see her before I leave. Here... Give her this. I hope you pay him! School never ends, huh. He can't go to trial yet. Too many weird things. We would need his version. And that guy won't talk. He might be pretending, or he's been drugged. - This is a lost case. - No. - Miss, not you... - Solo, I won't change my mind. Fine. That's good. You were very brave. What do you want? - I want you. You know that. - Very funny. Why the attitude? I just want to congratulate you. Well done. Nice job with the girl. You're good in this kind of cases. The rebel matter is too big a case for you. Good God! Let them execute him and move on. Give me a pack of cigarettes, any kind. Thank you. The Rebel is Alive Why a Trial? Too late. The police officers came to get him. What police officers? They had Intelligence Services passes. Solo, meet me at the IS office. I need a witness. Right now! The military say you don't talk. We think you do. Let's start over. What is your name? I hear you're injured. This is illegal! Let us do our job! Who are you? - I'm his lawyer. - Damn it. From now on, I'll watch every interrogation. We don't care. This guy can save us more deaths. But he hasn't been part of the rebellion for 3 months. If you don't bring him back to his cell, I'll tell the media that the police torture my client, and I will sue you for obstruction of justice. - We have orders. - Orders! The president wants a trial. You are breaking the law! And you'll pay the price. He'll be executed anyway! That's not my problem. But it must be done within the law. I want to talk to him in private. That won't be possible. My client has a right to a private talk with his lawyer. I assume responsibility. Stay behind the door. "Thank you". No? I brought you the papers. You want to see? "The rebel is alive. Why a trial?" "The faces of the big river murderers". "An unidentified rebel has been imprisoned". You're a real star. I thought maybe you would like to have a smoke. So you do understand what I'm saying. It's not allowed to smoke. But us, lawyers, have certain privileges. Do you want the cigarette or not? You don't want to talk? Fine. Let's make a deal. Nod your head yes, shake your head no. And I'll give you a cigarette in exchange. Let's make a test. Alright? Here. It's for you. You'll have to answer my question first. Do you know what's at stake? Do you trust me? Why not? You think I'm setting you up? I can't help you if you don't talk to me. I want... Ganja! I can't give you that. But I can provide you with cigarettes. Better than nothing, eh? Where do you come from? Down there. - Down there? - It's quiet here. I like it. Tell me your name. Hitler Mussolini. That's my war name! What was your previous name? Blackshouam. - Blackshouam what? - I don't remember. Did you talk to anyone else before me? Well? Did he talk? He gives me the chills. - His name is Blackshouam. - Yes! You did it, miss! Given the charges, you can represent the defendant. Are you going to plead guilty? - I don't know yet. - Have you talked to him? I'm not sure he understands the situation. All the eyewitnesses concur. Has anyone identified him as one of the murderers? Mr. Sylla. They only mention the moment of the arrest. Who's "they"? The army and the villagers. I have nothing. Has anyone identified him? Are there any new elements? I'm on a lead. - May I know which lead? - Yes, Your Honor. As soon as you give me all the information. Mr. Sylla will give you everything we have. We also have to set the date of the trial... I ask for the statutory time limit to prepare the defense. We have no time. Tell me, miss, what does your father think about this? Ms. Tou, you were granted a 15-day time limit. Is this a victory for the defense? I only wanted the law to be enforced. What is she going to do? - She's worthless. - She's Mr. Tou's daughter! That's between them bosses! It's always like that. What is this plastic rice doing here? When was the last time you paid me? You have your portion. That's all! Someday I'll cut your dick off, Boukson! Go ahead, give it a try! You don't dare say your name. My sister defends whomever she wants! It's been like this all day. - Where's Emma? - Mademoiselle is in the kitchen. Emma, everybody's calling me. What's got into you, honey? Drop that case. It's not for you. Are you talking? Your father says it's dangerous for us. - It's our reality! - You're not in Europe anymore! They're going to think we support those people. We're victims of the insurgence too, aren't we? Victims? What do you mean? No, she didn't mean that. We had to run away. Is that why you left the forest? Yes. We fled the mine when things got ugly. You always said you wanted to give birth here! We wanted to leave all that behind. We started over again with our baby, and that baby was you. Emma, I beg you, don't get your hands dirty with that guy. I don't know who ignores me the most, you or your father. Hey! We're going to take care of you! Can you hear us, rebel? It's us, the big men! Poki! Poki... No! Get off me! Help! Help me! Help! No! No! - Leave me alone! No! - You're going to give it back! Miss, the State is wearing him out. He hasn't eaten in three days. Why didn't you tell me? Here. I brought you a sandwich. But it's give and take! What? You think that petty piece of bread and some cigarettes will allow you to talk to me like that? Do you know who I am? Do you know my rank? I'm Hitler Mussolini. Colonel. A little girl like you! You ain't going to buy Colonel with some sandwich! It is me who asks people questions. You think you're going to interrogate me? Who are you? Who sent you here? I'm Ms. Tou, lawyer. I'm here to defend you. You're going to defend me? No one defends me. I've defended a whole area. You're nothing but a girl. Piss off, and take your sandwich with you. Hey, you! Have you won a trial before? You actually think I want to win this trial? I want to defend you so you can have a trial, to give this country some respect. Let them come to me. Come and get me. Come on, you bunch of pigs! Come on! I'll rip your eyes out with my bare hands! My men are there: Doctor, Pablo, Poison... Those sons of a bitch think I'm a slave! Come! What are you waiting for? You... You remind me of a little girl we picked up from a village. She was cute like you. What was her name? Awa. That's how I call her. The day she turned 13, a major wanted to take her from me. I mean, he tried to. What was the major's name? None of your business. You're right. I'm not going to get executed. So, what did the major do? The major... when he wanted a go, he'd just rape them and that's it. But this girl, Awa, he would come and see her while I was on patrol. He'd give her presents. He'd joke around. But not me. - He wanted to seduce her? - That's right. So one day, I told Awa: "Come with me to the woods. I want to show you something". Awa came. I said: "Turn around. Look over there". And I took my commando knife. You weren't interrogated? No. No one has interrogated me yet. Why were you involved in a military operation? Amnesty was asking for a Red Cross observer to deny the accusations of atrocities committed by the army. What accusations? Execution of prisoners, repression against villagers... But nothing went as planned. Tell me. I got there at night. The army was in ambush near the village. Me and an officer were pulled out. We waited for hours and then... at 6 am, we heard gunshots in the distance. Then, nothing at all. We waited for a while. And then a strong offensive took place. So the offensive came after the shooting? Yes. I heard the order on the officer's walkie-talkie. Did you see the rebel? It was me who saw him first. Would you testify in the trial? If it's a legal trial, yes. Of course. I have nothing to hide. If you defend him, be careful with that man. From my experience in Sierra Leone and Congo, they need psychological therapy. As long as they're conditioned, they remain dangerous. They waited for the massacre to be over to intervene. So the Red Cross would see the atrocities. For that, they needed to catch a rebel in the act. It's huge. - Will we be able to prove it? - No. We need more than one witness. He didn't see anything, anyway. You're going to look over the testimonies to determine how much time passed between the gunshots, and the kind of weapons. OK. His version and the military report are contradictory. I'll prove that they jumped on an injured, unarmed man who fought back and didn't take part in the attack. Enough to cast doubt on the case. Hey, rebel! Today's your lucky day. We're cleaning up your cell. You're going to put your hands in the hole. Please, do something stupid so we can kill you. Have a seat. Sit down. Relax. You see, when I'm with people, I like them to be relaxed. Sit down. Do you have a husband? No. - A boyfriend, then. - No, no boyfriend. You have children. No children either. That's good! They won't want to mess around. You said you were a colonel. - Did you decide the attack on V32? - I was given orders. - Orders from who? - Them. You think I'm a traitor? Tell me, then. Give and take. If you answer my question, I will answer yours. What do you want to know? Before this, you had a boyfriend. My father was strict. I studied at a convent school. Oh! A convent school! That's no life! I was very happy. How were you arrested? The military were waiting for us. Someone sold us. But, wait, you've had sex before, right? Let's change the subject. I don't want to. This is interesting! I will only talk in exchange for information. Give and take. I know the name of the village I was born in. Want to know? In France... you did have sex. Men are like here. Are you telling me you're a virgin? Look, we made a deal. Alright. My village... is the V6. Next to the barricades. - You could've said it earlier. - You're a virgin. How long did you live there? I left when I enrolled in the Liberation Front. How old were you when you enrolled in the LF? I was 8. - You were enrolled at 8? - Why's that important? When those bastards killed my parents, the leader took me in as his son. Get me out of here, and I will give you diamonds. Lots of diamonds. Where would you go? Back to fighting. Very well. I'll talk to the judge. He'll send investigators to V6. Courthouse Emma! What's the hurry? The judge refused a letter rogatory. - To go where? - V6. My client was born there. That's the barricades village! Are you kidding? I'll say there's been a fundamental error. The court refuses to identify the defendant. Emma, open your eyes. This will be a closed trial, held at a criminal court. No public, no jury. Only 7 judges in front of you. Do you understand? They'll put you there as mere decoration. At least you won't show off. The trial will be broadcast live on TV and the radio, honey! I brought you this. It's the pictures the military took to identify the bodies. This is when they were alive. And this is the aftermath. You should have those. I hope you'll change your mind. So, Audran. Are you negotiating with the defense or just trying to melt the ice queen? That girl drives me crazy! I'll give an ox to the first man who takes her to bed. Real assholes! - I need their version, though. - I did what you asked. Gunshots were fired at two different moments. The witnesses were far from the village. From all the information I got, no one saw him kill any civilians. I know. But I need his version. What's the idea? We have to attenuate his responsibility within the chain of command and beyond. - Who's benefiting? - Exactly. Look, you figure out who's hiding behind the LF and how it works. I'll try to find out if he really is a former child soldier. Miss, something happened to your mother. Your dad didn't want me to call you. Emma, she had her stomach pumped. People are threatening her. It's too much! I'm sorry, Dad. - When will this nonsense end? - Dad, please! Get married, Emma. Have children. Then you'll understand what's important. Now leave her. She needs to rest. Look up! One hundred carats! How did you do that? - I'm smarter than I look. - And I'm like Saint Thomas. I only believe in what I can have. Do what I say, and I'll give you this. Call this number. There's a code. Hey, Boukson! That's enough! Get out of there, now! I talked to the manager. I hope you're OK. What's the matter? I couldn't come before because my mother got really sick. I stayed with her. She's doing better, thanks. Are you upset? I wanted to talk to you, but if you're not in the mood, I can come another day. Since you talked, Boukson brings me my meals. That's good. Those bastards won't poison me. I brought you some pictures. Do you want to see? These are family photos. See this little boy? His name is Tobias. He gets very good grades. This is his mom. She's a nurse. She's planted flowers in her garden. It's a family tradition. She's the best cook in town. - Why bring me this? - Would you like to meet them? Yes. The dad is a musician. He's in a band. I love bands! Especially the big instrument that goes "boom, boom". - The tuba. - Yes! But why are you telling me about those people? Because they're normal people with normal lives. They work. The kids go to school. They go to church on Sunday. They wear beautiful clothes. The mom used to go to town. She'd bring Stella with her. - That's her. - They don't do that anymore? - No. - Why not? Because their bodies were found where you were arrested. So what? They sold our parents! They had to obey. When that's the case, even a baby can hit back. You were given orders for that massacre? Who's your boss? We could invoke extenuating... We? Who's "we"? You're in this alone! I'm getting tired! Why are you doing this? So we can... To spare you the death penalty and get 10 or 15 years. You think I'll stay here for 15 years? We'll take you down way before that! It's Maglé. Those foreigners are watching us. Who's Maglé? That's our boss abroad. He'll send a war plane. We get that, and it's over! Hey, you're talking to a future colonel of your army! A colonel is a man who has military studies. A colonel has other men under his leadership. - I don't see any. - Watch your tone. What are you going to do? There are guards out there... What are you going to do now? You're useless. You can't get me out of here. You're not even pretty enough to be fucked! Come on, get lost before I change my mind! Don't ever come back here! Ever! How is she doing? She's sleeping. I wrote my resignation letter. Thank God! Oh, honey. Thank you so much. That's the best gift you can give me. Thank you. Hello, Emma... Come in, please. I haven't told you how impressed I am. I'm out of the case. My client dismissed me anyway. He didn't want you to be his lawyer? He made it very clear! Do you want a cup of coffee? Sit down. Let's talk. Look, sweetie, in tough cases like this the fundamental principle of justice reveals itself. No matter how serious a case is, it is still defendable. No matter how strong the storm, there will always be a lawyer. I don't want to go down with the ship. Emma, what's at stake in this trial goes far beyond your personal feelings or my personal feelings. Justice can change. Many people believe in you and are willing to help you, as long as you go to the end. And by the way, I won't let you resign on an impulse. Think it over. You have two days. Mademoiselle! - Your assistant is waiting outside. - OK. Thank you. I'm calling you but you won't pick up the phone. An old man wants to bear witness. Come see him. - Where is he? - He's here. I'll get him. I have information. It's personal. I had to talk to you first. Are you listening? Chief Bako, open the door. You ripped them up? That was an item on your file. Last night, they came. They got their pictures out, like driver ants. Even the other ones. What other ones? The women... Everything I had forgotten. That's the tough part. The beginning. Then, you forget. To become a good soldier, you never stop learning. The old, motivated soldiers ask, "What does a bayonet want?" "To kill, sergeant! To kill, kill, kill!" Killing in real life is nothing like training. I didn't know that war was like that. The bosses were furious. The order was to kill everybody. And then, they gave us rum. They kept screaming that it'd get heated. "Today is the day!" Then, they took some razor blades and started to cut our legs. They cut and cut... Those who cried were hit with a belt, boots. Those who said nothing were rubbing cocaine on their cuts. They said that if a bullet hit us, it'd run down like water. We got there at 5 am. And I saw a woman. She was running to the woods. She was hiding something. I didn't know if it was a gun or what. We were given orders to shoot, so I shot. The bullets went through her. When I turned her around, I saw she was holding her stomach. Her belly blew up like a watermelon. And then, there was nothing. So I walked away. And then the others became like chickens, rats... I just wanted to kill them all. I wanted to kill women, men, old folks, babies being carried. To kill. I found someone who knew your family in V6. You're Blackshouam Vila. You were 8 years old when your dad, your mom and a baby were found in the school of which your dad was the principal. You also had a sister, Lucie Vila. Who is... I'm sorry. - He says the rebels killed them. - Liar! Your dad's from the same village as the president, which explains the tattoo. I don't care about none of that. I don't care about Dad. Why do men have to be fathers? I don't care about Dad, I don't care about Mom. Those bastards got exactly what they deserved! You have 24 hours left before the trial begins. The old man's testimony can prove Blackshouam had been kidnapped. That will certainly help you upset the court. I called the Red Cross representative. He's been authorized. He's ready. - What about the rest? - We have nothing. Suspicions, rumors, press articles, and a report on the diamond trade between the insurgence and people from the government. No evidence, though. In that case, you'll have to be very clever. You have virtually nothing to present at the trial. Hey! The other inmates are saying you've probably talked by now. They want to kill you. Now give it to me! You imbecile! I make the decisions here. Why can't I go with you? What do I have to do with all this? You're my friend. Is that how you talk to me now? Alright, alright. Fine. I get it. Damn! - Look what I found. - Who put that? The people from the river! Those bastards! Go throw that away. Come on! There. Now you can throw it out. What? I won't touch that! OK, fine. I'll do it. But listen, don't say anything to her. Not a single word! Today's the big day. We're going to court. What's wrong? What if I refuse? In 30 minutes, two brigades and three police vans will enter the prison. Do not resist. It will wake things worse. I wasn't bothering anyone. You're mixing me up. I'm over. They should just kill me already. You've given me nothing. You got into this water. You better swim now. I won't drown in this water. Tell me the truth, then. I want details. We might stand a chance. What were you doing at the LF? I'm junior colonel, North Front. I have 978 men under my command. Shock troops. - Any children? - Why? They're not soldiers for the law. Children are the best soldiers. - Are there a lot? - I don't know. - I have 176 Hitler killers. - What do they do? They go to the front when an operation is launched. How old are they? 9, 10, 11 years old... The older ones are 12. Why children? Because 20-year-old bastards have seen death before. Whereas a kid, when you say "finish him off", he obeys. Who gives you orders? Lieutenant colonel Baguida. He's in charge of the North Front. He decided the attack on V32? Who's above him? General Sampa. Chief of Staff. - And then? - Then comes our leader! They're here. They're coming for you. Once we get there, don't say you were a colonel and you had kids as soldiers. Come on. Put this on. Quick. I'll do the talking. Alright? In this courthouse, under extreme security measures, is going to be held a closed trial in the presence of international journalists. Peace and Justice Bring in the accused! Ladies and gentlemen, the Court! Well. This criminal court is now in session. Mr. Prosecutor, go ahead. The Prosecution, on behalf of the victims and their families, will ask for an exemplary penalty, up to the atrocities committed. We will seek the maximum possible sentence. The Defense may now speak. Miss Tou, does your client have anything to say before the hearing begins? He will remain silent. He will address this court through me. Court clerk! The witnesses will be heard now. My wife Aya and my grandson... 5 years old. My mom. My husband. They took him, and... And... They're going to crush her. I wouldn't be so sure. I think we've found our Joan of Arc. Were you there during the massacre? I was at my sister's. Here, in town. Who knows kilometers? I leave home at 5 am. I get to the camp at 8 am. That's my distance. So... the nearest witness was 2 km away. No further questions. - That's my lady. - She's going to win! We knew a Liberation Front operation was brewing up in the area. We wanted to set an ambush, but it was too late. Too late? The villagers had already been killed. The rebels were taking their loot. We attacked them and liberated the village. How many victims of the rebels did you count? 65. - We found no survivors. - That's correct. They spared no one. I haven't slept since I saw these photos. Thank goodness you arrived, major. How many rebels did you neutralize? Four were killed in action. The fifth one is here. The others managed to run away. Tell us about the arrest of the defendant. He opened fire and injured two of my men, but we eventually neutralized him. He was on drugs. He was struggling like a lunatic. He wounded two other men. Go see if the doctor and the old man are ready. I've no news. Even so, you arrested him and brought him to justice. The military code was enforced. If a civilian is arrested, he must be judged by civilians. Do the outlaws you fight against apply that code? No. If they get one of our men, we find him tortured. Describe those tortures. We find him undressed. Burned. His nose and ears cut off... His penis stuck in his mouth. Why don't you respond in the same way? Because I'm a servant of this country. I respect the law and order of my government. I'm not a killer. I defend my country against those madmen! - Ms. Tou may speak now. - At what time did you arrive to the scene with your 200 men? We deployed at around 4 am. And yet, all the witnesses say they heard gunshots at 6 am. They slipped through our security system. May I remind you that you're under oath. Do you know what perjury can cause? Objection! She's intimidating my witness. Objection sustained. Ms. Tou, please focus. What if one witness could compromise the credibility of our dear forces of defense? I now call the representative of the International Red Cross. May I ask for a continuance. I'm telling you, she just wants to mix them up. That girl is good. Is this a joke, Miss? He was summoned and the Red Cross authorized him. Here's the summons. I thought he was late. Maybe he got scared. No. The hearing should be postponed. No, we'll carry on. My witness is waiting. Please, Your Honor. A no-show can happen to anyone. What do you think? I accept the continuance on one condition only: I want to interrogate the defendant. He refuses to talk. Three months with the military and he didn't say a single word. They thought he had no tongue. And now he talks to your daughter. I asked you to intervene several times. She won't listen to me. My brother-in-law made a huge mistake with this trial. Now the international press is watching us. We are stuck. The old man wanted a lawful trial. If he arrests him, it all falls down. We're trapped. Would you like to replace Bruli as an ambassador in Zurich? Are you kidding? I am dead serious. It's your summons, and I'm here for that. But, why? Because in Switzerland, you will be free. You'll have diplomatic immunity and you won't be extraditable. We warned you. Your daughter stirred the shit. But... If I fall... What about you? As long as I'm a Secretary... Nothing. Listen to me. I'll do a last trip and I'll join you with the diplomatic bag. We have to create a new circuit. You're in. I'm not doing this anymore. You don't understand, my friend. It's an offer you cannot refuse. You're leaving tomorrow. Here. Two won matches and two ties. One goal... I have to know how you entered the insurgence. Try to remember what really happened. What I remember is... that one day... my mom was making bouillon rice... and a big piece of lamb. That scent... You could smell it in the yard. And then... What's the rush? Huh? Come and play with me. On your knees! I said, "on your knees"! You! See your old man there? Because of him, our men are dead! You're going to avenge us! Take this! - No! - Take it! - No! - Shoot! - No! - You're going to shoot! You will avenge us! Shoot! Look what we do to your mother! Look what we do to her! She deserves it! Mom! They forced an 8-year-old boy to watch. His mother didn't make it. Any child who is exposed to that, and as long as he survives the suicide attacks, hunger, abuse, rape... can become a Hitler Mussolini. In their world, they must kill to survive. Honestly, brother... You were right. Didn't I tell you so? She's good. And it's not over yet. - The Prosecution may now speak. - Don't let yourselves be deceived by the Defense. You're not judging an 8-year-old. You're judging a man who is liable for his actions. A man that murdered 65 innocent people. Plus all the soldiers he savagely injured during his arrest. And you want to make me believe that a traumatized 8-year-old was the one who did all that. We hear "liberation movement". Let's be serious now! There's no structured project behind all this! They're nothing but a pack of murderers and thieves that manage to run away when the forces of order are near! It's an insult to see those people as soldiers. What? Because you know what soldier is? Who's fighting here? You and your toy soldiers. Is that what you call a soldier? Carry on, sir. Hopefully, the defendant will keep quiet. On the contrary! Since he's decided to talk, the Prosecution calls the man known as Hitler Mussolini to the stand. He's not ready yet! Miss! It is time to keep your word. Please. They expelled the Red Cross representative. Remember what we said. You, shut up! Listen! Your attorney introduced you as a child soldier, enrolled in a nameless war. But we have no knowledge of such a war. It's more of a military operation against a group of terrorists who sack the villagers and our public property. And you talk about a war? Helicopter... tank, napalm... The commandos you send. Isn't that a war? Who's mining the fields? "You"... Who'd that be? Your flag back there. I'm an ignorant man, but I know those colors. We're fighting against them. Why are you fighting? Your president is against us. Why is he against you? Ask him. He started killing our people. Do you know what the government wants? They want to finish us off! Yes, of course. But... Those poor people who died in V32, where they a threat? I didn't kill anybody in V32. And yet, you were seen in V32 armed and wounded after the attack. When they got us there, they shot me first. I was exposed. Are you sure? Maybe it was one of your men. They started the assault. You did fight with the army. Those bastards! They take my amulet so they can kill me. But they know! Because us there, when we have medicines, there's no way. No blade gets in. No bullet gets in. They could have killed you if they'd wanted to. That White from the Red Cross. He was there. He sent me to hospital. You know the mines around your village. Like that old, State mine. - The Diaminco. - Yes. I worked as a bodyguard there for three years. For 3 years, your job was to protect the traffickers. So what? You'd stop the military from getting back control of the State mines. They shoot us, we shoot them. Mr. Hitler Mussolini, based on what you're saying, we would think you're an ordinary soldier. Your authority, your age... Do you have any child soldiers in charge? Objection! Nowhere are child soldiers mentioned in the V32 file. Mr. Prosecutor must say where he gets that info from. Everybody knows that the LF uses child soldiers! For 20 years now! Objection sustained. Let's stick to what happened in V32. You say you didn't murder anyone in V32. OK. - He put a mike in the cell. - What? Let's suppose you're innocent. What would you do if you were released? Would you go back to fighting? I don't think so. Why not? I've seen the city. What are you talking about? I didn't know you were so many. Too many to kill us all? Objection! Sustained. Sir, we understand this is a sensitive matter for you as the Prosecutor, but please restrain yourself. No further questions. 40,000 murdered or missing children. Hundreds of villages destroyed. 200,000 displaced people. One motive! They're against us. Their aim? To take the mines. All that guided remotely by foreign adventurers, crooks and traffickers of all kinds. It's a no man's land! There is no political vision whatsoever behind this so-called armed movement. They kill, they rape, they trade. That's what they do! Ladies and gentlemen of the court, it is your historical responsibility to say: "No!" Stop! The madness ends now! This is a civilized country! In this country, your barbaric lifestyle is punished by law! And what the law prescribes is the death penalty! Let that be clear! He pulverized us. Miss, the old man's gone missing. I think he was threatened. I know him! That's Maglé! He comes for the diamonds. Are you sure about that? Yes. That's our guy... He's a smart man! How does he do it to work with the son of the President? I know him. His name isn't Maglé. I know. It's a code. The man that used to come before... We'd call him Long John. He was a tall, light-skinned dude. Long John was very nice! He'd send us whisky and cigarettes... We haven't seen him in a long time. Now it's Maglé. Wait, how does this Maglé and Long John get to the mine? They have a plane. Red and white. Where were you? Daddy! Why aren't Pascal and Aunt Anne coming? There's not enough room. Come on, get in! That's why you didn't want a trial! You left the mine, you negotiated with the rebels. You knew what'd happen. I didn't decide on anything. What do you think, huh? I was nothing but a pawn. That's enough, Albert! Tell her the truth. What was I supposed to do? Huh? You think you'll stop the trade? You're dreaming! Yes, I was their link. I admit that. But then... Everything I've done, I've done it for you. For my family. We have a good life. You got to go to college. Listen to me, Emma. Stay away from that rebel. Mom, I don't know what to do. If you don't want to have the same nightmare every night, don't do what I did. Do now swallow the truth. Penitentiary Security Service Do you know who Maglé is? - Our guy. - The President's brother-in-law. Maglé? The war's been going on for 20 years because both sides benefit from it. I will inform against them, but I'm going to need your help. Why are you doing this? You didn't want all this. You've paid your dues. You deserve a second chance. I can't believe our leader did this to us! We've been fighting for nothing! I need dates, places... Everything on Maglé and Long John. Miss! I've found the plane. It's about to take off. It's not my father. He just called me. Send me the pictures. I'm on my way to see him. I haven't seen who's inside. What are you doing here? You're spying on us, you bastard! Thanks for coming. Was that Maglé on your plane? That's why I called you. He left with some buyers? It's for the campaign. He'll load some diamonds, which won't leave the plane. Why are you telling me this? They want to drag me back into it, Emma... And I can't let that happen. Do whatever you want with all this. Or do nothing at all. You're running away. Again. You're named after my mother, Emma. So... I want your blessing. May God protect you. This, too, will become a no man's land. You can't have that guy arrested. He's a relative, and a Secretary. But we can search a private plane, can't we? We need to hurry. He'll be back before dark. They want to charge Blackshouam Vila with all the crimes of the insurgence. And yet... He identified the man in this photo. That's the President's brother-in-law! ...and his role in the trade of diamonds with the insurgence. 2/3 of the diamonds produced by them come to this side of the border, right in front of the highest authorities. - Hands in the air! - Turn around! Spread your legs! The instrument panel. We interrupt this program for a news flash. A spectacular seizure of diamonds took place at the flying club. Two of the country's leading figures might be interrogated. If the facts are confirmed, they could be charged with high treason. Further to the protests in our country, the President has quickly responded. Secretary for Mines, suspended. Secretary of Defense, dismissed. The trial at the heart of the scandal was resumed this morning and the verdict is in. A 15-year sentence for Blackshouam Vila. People are in shock. The Secretary of the Interior says the riots will be put down, and that no revolution is underway. The government remains calm while considering an eventual suit against lawyer Tou. We tried to reach the rebel's cell, but once again we were refused entry. The eye of the storm that ravaged the government is here. Are you sure you want to go in? "Never give up!" I only killed one woman! Just one! She was a whore! How many people has he killed? You fucking bitch! You saved that pig and you let me die! Hey, honey. Open your eyes. He fooled you. I'll do anything you want. Just get me out of here! Why are all those people shouting outside? You won't serve full sentence. You can make an appeal. A virgin saved Hitler Mussolini! No. Blackshouam Vila, the war is over for you. They were here again last night. I can't look at them anymore. They were screaming. I can't do this anymore. They're a hundred times closer. On my neck... in my head... It hurts. You should learn to forget them. You're going to leave me alone? Nobody will let me plead again after what happened in this trial. You're leaving? Yes. - Do you know salsa? - I love salsa. Teach me to dance. You mean like, now? You can leave afterwards. Alright, why not. You start. You go one... Wait, wait... One... two... One... I'm good, eh? Two... Bako! Around 150,000 child soldiers have grown up in the African armed movements. To this day, there are no rehabilitation programs for their particular case. They are a ticking time bomb for the whole continent...
