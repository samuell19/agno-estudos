I told you you'd get sick. But lucky for you, I make a great bowl of soup. I never noticed that picture before. I just love seeing cute old couples together. You should really finish that soup, Sinan. Then take a few of these vitamins. I guess you don't want to eat when you feel so "oof." You won't believe this. Something crazy happened while you were out sick. You found out about Santa? Can you just listen? Ms. Distas is getting married. [indistinct chatter] [doorbell rings] - Hello. - Eda? Is there something you need? Yeah, I thought... Never mind. I just thought I'd stop by since you had the day off today. I wanted to talk about... Anyway, I'll come back some other time. Best of luck with everything. You're welcome to come in. I just got engaged. Is this for real? It's official. They got engaged. It's hopeless. Seriously, Işık, why do you care what happens? You don't have to do this, Sinan. Do what? Don't do this. Don't play games with me. You can just tell me. Hey, I didn't mean anything. I... Stop. I'm just trying to tell you I get it. But you can let me do something for you. I don't need anything back, and I won't be expecting anything from you anymore. [birds chirping] I understand now. ["Things I Love" by Chris Mathieu playing] ♪ Lover, lover, why so blue? ♪ [cooing] ♪ Just because I don't need you ♪ ♪ Never been one to hide ♪ Işık, I'm... - ♪ You asked me if I'd ever cried... ♪ - Really, I'm... What do you think you're doing? You really think I would take this back just because I'm upset with you? I understand it now. You think you know everything, but you have no idea. You don't have a clue, do you? Because life isn't some book. [doorbell ringing] I'll get it on my way out. This is a total shit show. What the fuck are we gonna do now? Come on. The others are right behind me. We need to look at the fiancé. His name is Tuncay. She goes where he goes. So we convince them to move to Istanbul after the marriage. - [Işik] No! - Well, why not? If this guy's such a jerk, Distas needs to see that. She'll decide to break up with him. She already chose him. That's what happened. So what now? Basically, I find a way to win his trust. [sighs] His soul is cheap. You can't deal with it. I hate to say it, but I think he's a waste of time. - That's all you can come up with? - [Eda] All right, hold on. How do you think we should play this? Since you all know how assholes think. With guys like this, it's not enough to think a step ahead of them. In the end, he'll sink lower than you could have imagined. Forget this one. Well, then... Fuck it, let's just keep trying with Mr. Altuna. Maybe we're only confusing her. I think our best bet is still the fiancé. Mr. Altuna's a long shot. Better to work with something that's already there. - It's a lot easier than breaking them up. - [Kerem] Hold on a second. Why not try both things? Osman, you work on Tuncay. If it works, it works. If not, Mr. Altuna's not going anywhere. - That works. - Good for me. So that's what we'll do. We've only got one more month left. If we all agree, I propose we start - by giving the man his jacket back. - [Sinan] Wait, that's Mr. Altuna's jacket. Bingo. [indistinct chatter] - Have a good day, my love. - Do you have plans for the day? - I think I'll get your ring resized. - Oh, that's great. I'll see you tonight. - Excuse me, sir. - Yeah? My name is Osman. Sinan, my good friend, asked me to find you. This is yours, I think. - This is... - Yes, very expensive. Thought you'd want it back. Here. Yeah. Thank you. By the way, you wouldn't happen to have plans tonight? I have two Fenerbahçe tickets for today's match. Pretty good seats. I was going with my dad, but he can't make it. Would you like to come with me? Fenerbahçe tonight... VIP? - Sure. - Sounds good. Since we have some time, why don't I take you out to lunch before the game? Istanbul is the greatest city in the world. I don't know how you could live anywhere else. Sure. But only if you can afford it. - It's a bit too rich for most of us. - Money's not a problem. Istanbul has plenty of opportunities for a man like you. Really? We have a little time. Come walk with me, and I'll show you what I mean. Okay, this guy here's my main rival. It's small shops like these. This is how I compete with them. Come on. [school bell rings] I sell food to the school cafeteria. The name of the game is variety. Girls usually get pasta, but in the spring, they start their new diets. So we better have salads for them. Boys are easier. They like sandwiches. But you gotta change it up, or they get bored. And where does it all come from? [chuckles] Supply chain economics, man. [doorbell rings] [Osman] Every day, people in homes all over the city make hundreds of sandwiches, salads, and pastas. I have them delivered here. I can assure you, we're growing. Should be up and running in six different schools next year. Do you sell to them directly? All you have to do is win the bid. Ali underbids everyone. Then, with the help of fake documents, it looks like he's getting food from approved vendors. - But he's only getting it from us. - [chuckles] That's very impressive. You must be rolling in money. I'm looking for someone to manage our new schools next year. You seem like a smart guy. Wanna make money, too? Are you serious? Why the hell not? If what you're saying is true and it's that easy to make money in this city, meals by the river, my favorite soccer team this year... Come on! Glad you're on board. So can I count you in? What I can't understand... is how you pulled this off. You're just some fucking kid. [chuckles] Come on! Give me a second. I need to calm my nerves. [groans] - What's going on? - Huh? Is everything all right? Are you here for something? Um... Yes, I am. I am. Sure. Um, we all know that the May 19th holiday is coming up. - I was thinking for the shows this year... - Of course. I'm planning them. Mr. Karakis wants me to do the job. [Işık] Um, that's what I wanted to talk about. We... Uh, I should say through my official role as the elected spokesperson for the students, we feel Coach Altuna and the assistant principal should supervise the shows this year. [Billy] Oh, there's no need for that. I'm happy to do it. He and I will handle it just fine. Uh, I'm sure that's true, but we thought since she's leaving, this could be a good way to say good-bye. I... That's a very sweet idea, it's just, um... the coach doesn't have to be involved. No, since the coach is new, we thought you and he, uh... I should say we... can all honor our past and our future. [Refik] I think it's a brilliant idea. I'm so proud to see our students being so thoughtful, coming up with a plan like this. Well done. [clears throat] [door opens] Can we talk for a minute? Well, Ms. Distas. What a surprise. - Come have a seat. - I think I'll stay here, thank you. I'll talk here, and you talk there. That's perfect. Sounds fun. We're going to be together. Hey, hey! Let's go get to it! I'm not talking about that. I mean that you and I will have to work together for a short time. The students want us to supervise the May 19th celebrations. Well, that's just... [chuckles] not really my skill set. I'm not exactly thrilled to be working with you either. I mean... you don't have to do it. I can think of a few things that even I could do. If you are referring to something I might have said the other night, I can guarantee you that I didn't mean a single word of it. - What did you mean? - Nothing. I didn't mean anything. I didn't say anything. There's nothing to discuss. When do we start? This will never happen. If you could stop thinking about that for a second. I'm asking when we start rehearsing. Oh... We can meet during lunch, if that's okay with you. Well, then, it sounds like I'm taking you out for lunch today. Move. How'd it go? They love the idea. Planning should start today. I almost lost it in there. If they ever found out how many lies I told them... They won't find out, I promise. You're safe. Sinan's got a doctor's note for ten whole days. Lucky! I really hope he's feeling better.

Have you been drinking? No, actually, I haven't been. What do you want? To tell you... that I... want to stay in school. I want to graduate. Maybe even go to university like any other cog in the machine. I just... I want to live a happy life. I mean it. I keep thinking that maybe this is what it feels like to believe in something. That your shitty life is worth living. It's amazing. For the first time, I'm actually making plans for the future. Do you wanna know why? Please don't. That's why we had that conversation. Take your mean jokes and use it on someone else. You can't use them on me anymore. I'm glad you're feeling better, but now you really need to go. It's so hot out here I feel like I'm going to faint or something. How long are they gonna keep us out here? I mean, come on. [Burak] Hey, Kerem! - What do you want? - We need to talk. Eda was pretty clear. She definitely has feelings for me. So what are you still doing with her? Are you telling me to get out of the way for you? Maybe. Then say it. Get me out of the way. You must really want to get beat up again, don't you? You want that? Seriously, man. You're really messed up. - Hey, what the fuck? - Come on. - What the fuck are you doing? - Keep walking. We need to talk. What are we? - I don't want to talk. - I'm gonna be straight with you. You hear me? You are going to answer all my questions. Not later, and not tomorrow. Don't tell me what to do. This isn't shit I need to explain. Shut up! I'm not just some guy you can push over! You don't scare me. Why don't you listen to me? I need to talk to you. There is something between us. Don't pretend like you don't see it, too. I'm an aggressive, dumb shit. But I want to change for you. You don't have to change for me. I don't care that you're aggressive. Actually... Actually what? I kind of like it. It's just who you are. So then why won't you be with me? It's just not that easy. It's complicated, if you'd listen to me for one second! I care about you too much, and it's fucking me up to be this obsessed with you, you know? Sorry, but I am not gonna let myself get hurt this time. [school bell rings] - Don't leave now, please! - Stay the fuck away! Shit! Burak. Eda and I broke up. We're over. She's all yours. [inaudible] - Here. - Thank you. - Not bad for a first rehearsal, right? - Mm-hmm. Are you hungry? Yes, I am. Better head to the cafeteria. You can join me if you like. Well, what if we forget about the cafeteria? Let's try something new. Sounds good to me. [chuckles] - It's hot! [giggles] - Have a drink. This is really good. I could come here every day. Best noodles in the city. Bet you I can cook this. I'm sorry, but I don't think so. You don't believe me? Hmm? I'll have to prove it one day. You will. Yes. Um... that is, if we can find the right time. If it works with our schedules, I mean. Pretty sure it'll work.

[TV playing indistinctly] New? - TV needed an upgrade. - Oh. - Honey, I'm starving over here. - Oh, I already had dinner. I should have told you. Don't worry about it. Could you whip something up for me? You know how much I love my sweet fiancée's cooking. I'm useless in the kitchen. Can't crack an egg. It's not that hard. - Nah. - You can cook an egg. I mean, it's easy enough for a monkey to do. Yeah, well, what do I need a monkey for? I got my lady. Why would I need to learn to cook? Fuck! See what I can whip up. [Kerem] Osman, take this. I'm not giving it to anybody. - You sure? - I mean it, man. Take it. I'll take it. - What for? - No reason. It's all yours. Mmm! Mm, mm, mm. What did I do to deserve such a talented fiancée?

It's a surprise. ♪ Now that I've lost everything to you ♪ ♪ You say you want To start something... ♪ [adult Işık] Until then, Burcu thought she had herself figured out. Her life was simple. She was happy with her job, her decisions, and her fiancé. She'd never thought to question any of it. But there was something she hadn't planned on: Kemal.

Mm-hmm. Osman, I have something to ask. You seem to care a lot about money. I'm curious to know why do you care so much? - I mean, it seems like a lot of work. - The man likes money. Yeah, but thinking about money all the time must be exhausting. It is. But if you have enough money, you don't worry about it. Money is a major obstacle. Without money, you can't do the things that you want to do. You make enough money, it's never a problem. Actually... I think you can do lots of things without money. You might think you can, but someone has to think about the money, or nothing gets done. Just name an everyday problem. Okay... How am I gonna get home tonight? Money can get you anywhere. No problem. Traffic doesn't care how much money you have. When a man is successful, people have to wait around for him. Problem solved. Huh. True. What if you want a spontaneous experience? How do you buy that? Pay the right people, and they'll show you whatever experience you can think of. You want to visit another country, you can do it. When you get sick, you can pay for a doctor. Wanna learn a language, money will buy you time. Enough to do anything. So it looks like money can solve anything. Hm. But what if you can't stop thinking about money, even after you have lots of it? What will you do then? [chuckles] In that case, you're just an addict. The only fix is to lose the cash. [chuckles] What about love? What if you want to earn someone's love? And I don't mean buying expensive gifts or paying someone to sleep with you. Money definitely can't get you love. Nothing can do that. Love takes your heart and squeezes it down until it's nothing. [Işık] That's so true. So then what are we going to do about Ms. Distas? Coach Altuna and her are great together, but nothing is happening. Because she's already engaged to someone else. I got Tuncay to trust me. We're almost done with him. I'll talk with Ali tomorrow. The rest will be easy. Well, I hope it all works out. Still, I wish things were different. We still might save our asses. [Işık chuckles] [Burcu] See you tonight. - What are you going? - I'll follow you in. I can get to work myself. You don't have to come with me. Mr. Karakis and I have a meeting. We're talking business. What business could you possibly have with Mr. Karakis? - [Tuncay] It'll tell you later. Let's go. - [Burcu] What are you up to? [indistinct chatter] [Osman] What the fuck is this? Somebody spilled the beans to the school board. Told them that Ali was selling food from unapproved vendors. They asked for papers, and Ali didn't have any, so they shut us down on the spot. Any other schools? The other schools have been notified as well. They ripped up all the contracts. Osman! It was that rat-faced motherfucker! Where did you find that son of a bitch? - Who do you mean? - That guy you brought the other day. He went right to Necdet and told him everything. He wants the whole cafeteria business to himself. - And? - [Ali] The idiot fucked that up, too! From now on, the schools will run the cafeterias themselves. No more contracts! Fuck! Fuck! - What are you going to do now? - [Ali] What can I do? I lost everything. All our people have lost their jobs. How did this happen? It's ruined all my people's lives, their careers. What are they supposed to do now? How could he do this to us? How are we gonna put food on the table now? Come on, man. Why the hell did you have to bring this scumbag around? Why did you have to tell him every single little thing? Every single detail? I can't believe it. Come on. Good luck, man. This is on you. [Sinan] Well, with guys like this, it's simply not enough to think a step ahead of them sometimes. In the end, he'll sink lower than you could have ever imagined. Forget this one. Thief! Thief! That guy stole my jacket! - Hey. - Give me my jacket. Hey, shh. Just calm down. It was a mix-up. Calm down, I'll give it back. - Fucking kids. - What's going on here? Nothing. Just a misunderstanding. Let's go. Come on. You know kids. [Burcu] Sorry, everyone. Did you have a good day, my son? I want to hear all about it. Is everything all right? Mm-hmm. Before we head home, we need to stop at the grocery store for a few things. That's fine. How was your day? Oh, you know. Busy. Lots of errands. - Uh, so, Dad? - Yes, son? What's up? Nothing. I was just going to ask about Mom. How is she doing? Oh, she's good. She did all the laundry today. Cleaned all the floors, too. She seemed pretty sick of it, actually. She'll kill us if we forget the groceries. - Do you know anyone at the Land Registry? - Huh? If everyone enters from this side, we can keep the costumes on the other side for quick changes, and we can put the costume assistants over there, too. They should have plenty of room to work with. We can always have some extra... - Are you here with me? - I'm listening. [Burcu] All right. What do you think? Come home with me, and I'll cook us dinner. - Tonight? - Mm-hmm. Do you have any other plans? Um... it's just... If I come over, we might... So you don't know what'll happen? What are you afraid of? We can share a few drinks again... Then you'll say things you don't mean again. We can do new things, too. Whatever we want. I'm sorry. What's up? It's just... you said we can do what we want, but I can't do that. It's impossible. But why? [laughs] We're together all day. We both see what's going on. I mean, yesterday, you kept coming to my office after the rehearsals. Eight different times. You had a new excuse each time. I'm not wrong about this, right? When we touch... What's the problem? There's something I haven't told you. [sighs] If that's true... then you have to tell me. It's not like I'm one of your students. Please don't hate me when I tell you this. I'll have to decide that for myself. I'm engaged. I'm moving back home next month to get married. I have a job there. And so is my family. [sighs] Then what was this? What are you trying to do to me? What do you mean? It was never my intention to hurt you. I'm trying to hold myself back. Trying to say no. I'm saying it to you just like I'm saying it to myself, a thousand times every day. Every morning, I get up, I try to get rid of all the thoughts that go racing through my mind. Do you understand? Do you have any idea? Do you know how awful it is? How hard I have to fight these feelings for you? You don't know what it's like for me. Okay. I'll make things easier for you, then. Don't worry. [exhales] [Tuncay] Aww. That's a perfect fit. It'll never come off again. Congratulations, Burcu. I wish you both the happiest of weddings. I'll be sure to pass that on. [man] Wow! - Thank you so much. - Congratulations. Do you think it'll be a boy first, or a girl? [both chuckle] So you're getting married, then. That's nice. I guess I misunderstood. Oh, Kemal, come in! Come in! We're celebrating Burcu. She's getting married.
