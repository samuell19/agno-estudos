Fuck, it’s hot. I’m melting. Let´s go to the pool. I´m broke. Fuck… Between this heat and your boring ass, I’m gonna fall asleep. I broke up with Laura. Laura? Which Laura? Which fucking Laura do you think I am talking about? The one with the big tits? Watch it, asshole! She’s my girlfriend. Well, more like your ex now, right? You broke up with her. Yeah, ok. That girl is the shit… Damn. Fuck man, I don´t get it… Why did you break up with the hottest girl on Earth? You’ re a pain in the ass… Not cool, man. Half of the neighbourhood gets a boner everytime she walks by. You were our fucking hero, Jota! Fine! I´m the only one who doesn´t get a boner anymore, ok? Shut your trap! What a stud... You got it on with another girl, didn´t you? You are such a pain in the ass. She must have huge titties, cause Laura… Never seen anything like her. Do you want me to hit you? Or maybe you nailed a fugly girl. And that´s why you´ve been so emo all week. Do you wanna shut up? Can´t you see I´m having a shitty time? So why did you hook up with a troll then? I haven´t hooked up with anyone! Ah, I see…So you like some other girl, but you haven´t boned her yet. Am I right? Where are you going? Tell me who she is! Jota! Is it Tamara? No. Fuck, I would eat her tuna taco any day of the week. Merche? No, not Merche. I know… Asun! Good god, what a booty. I would toss that salad like a fucking chef… No, not Asun.. Ok? Slut… What? It´s Carmen, right? Carmen? Which Carmen? Dude! Carmen… Carmen, man? She’s 40 and has more hair on her face than I do on my nuts! Ok, ok… Shit, we´ve been over the whole neighbourhood, I was just making sure. I hate this fucking heat… I´m going home, my playstation awaits. Hold up… Didn´t you wanna go to the pool? Well? What do you think? This is your plan? Did you forget to pay your brain bill? I´ve heard these scientology people have a pool on the rooftop. Wouldn´t it be cool to use it? Right, dude. We become scientologists so we can take a dip. You got it! Are you high? No! Look, we go there, we play along… Yes, aliens do exist. No, of course Tom Cruise is not gay… And we get a free pass to the pool! Do you want it or not? No. Hi… We… We are here to join the cult. What my buddy means is that we’d like some information. Well, if you are interested, you can take a free personality test. Who would like to start? My mom always says that I don’t have much of a personality, so… my buddy here will start. This way… … With this machine we can tell what is blocking your potential. I will ask you a series of questions and we´ll find out what´s getting in the way of your progress in life. Cool! Like a lie detector? Like the ones cops use? Put your hands on the sensors while I ask you some questions. If the needle jumps, we´ll know what´s bothering you, even if you don´t realize it. What´s your name? Jota. Off to a good start… What? His full name is Jorge David Serrano since forever and the needle did not move. How is your relationship with your family? Good. How´s school? Alright. Are you seeing someone? Awesome! Let´s see if he answers you, he won´t tell me a thing… Can you shut up, asshole? Do you have a girlfriend? No. But… Is there anyone you like? Any special friends? Ask him if he likes Fat Jessica… I can’t think of anyone else. Ask him… ask him for real. Do you like fat Jessica? The thing is it seems something is bugging you about your love life. What? No, seriously… The machine never lies. Well, maybe… You don´t have a girl in mind… maybe... it´s a guy. Come on, lady… That machine is broken for sure. My friend here is as much of a faggot as I am an astronaut… Right, Jota? Jota? No fucking way… Is that why you have been so down? Fuck… You don´t wanna get in my pants, do you? Yeah, right on. I´m crazy for you. I love the way you snore. And how you pick your nose and wipe the snot on your pants, that makes me so hard. And your nasty feet and… Ok, ok. You made your point. What do you want me to think? I just found out you like getting your browneye poked. Dickhead. Jota… Jota, wait… So… Who do you like then? Because you like someone, right… Come on… “The machine never lies” Ah, ok. It’s Frank, right? No, not him. Javi… Nope. Edu, it´s Edu for sure… I´ve seen him in the locker room, he´s packing some heat… He should be a cop. Come on man… Spit it out. Come on, for real… You like Juanlu! "Dear Kings of the Magi, Even though I want lots of things I'd be happy if you just give my dad a job, he's out of work.". Go on. "Well, that and the dress from "Frozen" which is my favorite film. But if that's not possible, it's OK. Dad's job will be enough. A kiss. "Lucas." Darling, don't you want anything else apart from the princess dress? An action man, a board game, for example? -Oblak's gloves. -Of course! ICE PRINCESS We're doing it for his own good, for his future, aren't we? They laugh at him in school. And my son is as good as gold. Too good. -If you didn't spoil him so much... -What? So it's my fault he's like this. Yes, a bit. Yes, a bit? What have I done wrong? He still wants to sleep with you because he's scared Ursula will take him. - He's seven, Carmen. - Yes, it's all my fault. I didn't say that. For spoiling him, for sleeping with him. Even for you not having a job. Forget it. Yes, but you always take it out on me. and all I do is work and work. There he is. How are you, Anabel? Let it go! What about "Hello"? The cooked ham. He didn't touch it. Love, I'll never learn. Coffee? No, not if it isn't Dolce Gusto capsules. That stuff tastes like it's watered down. So tell me, how's Antonio coping with the job thing? He's not coping, Anabel. You know what I'm like. - If you need anything, just ask me. - Then pass me the chorizo. We talked about it, I can do it now. The mortgage is paid off. Vito's doing well, we're fine and it all looks good. We know that. Yes, but I like repeating it, love. In my house, right now, we're doing very well. Now you'll look like Lito, my husband. Who laughs at me and says: "You'd have this like an NGO if you could". -And I say "Well..." -Lucas, your snack! This is for the garbage. Well, well, well. Why are we playing with this? You've got loads of toys in your room. Do you think no one sees you? Even if your mom and I are chatting, your other mom never takes her eyes off you. -What other mom? -Mary. -Mary who? -The Virgin! God Jesus Christ, we're making you suffer so much much between all of us. What are you going to do with the boy? Do about what? I swear, I've got something here and I can't live, or eat, or sleep. It's kid's stuff, all right, that's true, but when I was bringing him from the park we met Angelines' twins and they said something very serious to your son. I don't want to tell you, I don't want to say the words. What did they say? Just think, what could they have said, Carmen? Say it. -Say it! -Faggot. Faggot, homosexual. And it's very crude, OK? You have to see it and suffer it, believe me. Why don't you take him to Fr. Domingo? Look I swear, I promise, you don't know Fr. Domingo. Please, please. When mom died, my brother, Tanín, was in a bad way. Because of his friends, whatever. Anyway, he strayed from the flock. I promise, Fr. Domingo has a way with people, he's daring, he's wise, you laugh with him. In two days my brother was straightened out and back in the flock. I'll say it here and in Rome. I'm 100% in favor of Fr. Domingo. - I swear I'm a Dominguera... - Shut up, please! It's a phase. He'll get over it. Let it go, let it go! And I'll rise like the break of dawn! If you say so... Mom? -Yes? -Will you sleep with me? You have to learn to sleep alone. You're old enough. -But I'm scared. -Scared of what? Look, we're at home. Dad and I are right here. Come on. Go to sleep. -Mom. -Yes? Why did you change my room? At time we have to get used to things we don't like. For our own good. Good night. I liked it better before. I'm sorry about yesterday. I'm a bit stressed about work and... I know. It'll all work out, you'll see. Are you taking me to see the Kings? Grandma, do you think the Kings will bring me Elsa's dress from "Frozen"? Of course they will. Weren't you very good this year? Lucas, where did you get to? Your mom's been looking for you. That's great. What do you think? Like it? You can tell the Kings to bring this if they can't bring the princess outfit. I really like it, love. Do this, like Spiderman does. The Kings will know what best for children, won't they? Well, my friend, were you good this year? You didn't upset your parents? Well, then I'll have to cancel the coal I ordered for you. Now, what do you want this year? A job for my dad. All right, in that case, I'll talk to our office in the East so they get a job for your dad. But what would you like? The princess dress from "Frozen". -It's my favorite film. -Well! -So you like princesses? -Yes. -What's your name? -Lucas. Lucas. Listen, Lucas, I'm going to tell you something between you and me. Never stop playing, understand? No matter what people say, you keep playing. There are more children waiting. Come on. Lucas, behave yourself, OK? It's amazing how clear children see things, isn't it? -Merry Christmas, family. -Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, friend. Happy holidays. Hey, I forgot something. What is it? -You go on. -What? We'll wait for you. No really, I'll take the bus. -We'll go with you. -I'll take the bus. OK, OK. Hello, can you help me, please? Just a minute, I'm busy. Yes? Look, it's... I work for the Kings of the Magi. Yeah? Maybe you can tell them to bring me the Play 4. My mother won't buy it for me. Yeah. Well, they want to change this gift and they're not sure of the size. Look and see if... -It'll be complicated. -Why? People are busting our asses this year with that fucking "Frozen" costume. All the girls are asking for it. I don't know what's so great about it. I don't know if we'll have one. How tall is she? - No, it's a boy. - No, I mean for the costume. No, it's a boy, my son, and he's about this tall. Well? Maybe it isn't on the instructions, but this is for girls. If you like I can offer you other costumes for... special boys. Sponge Bob, for example, is very popular. But the Kings want that costume. They're even willing to make a complaint if necessary. Jose, isn't that your name? -He's this tall? -Yes, more or less. I think this will be right for him. All right. In any case, you can get a gift receipt... -Yeah. -...so you can exchange... You're welcome, smiler. The sky's awake! The Kings have come! Do you like it? It's... What's wrong? I wanted Elsa's costume, she's the other princess. What are you doing with my phone? You were posing. Stay. Fran please, not again. Come on, only tonight. What am I going to do a whole week if I don't see you? I told you thousands of times. They are waiting for me at home. Come on, call them. I can't, I forgot my phone. Call from mine. I'll call them myself. I don't like it when you mess around with my family. I'll miss you. Me too. I have to go. Here. Come whenever you want. Call me tonight ok? Ok If you don't call me, I will. A phone is ringing. Are you deaf? It's Javier's. He forgot it. Give it to me. Give it to me. Do you want to finally get to know your son? Look at this photo. Look at it! You always knew that your son was a pervert, didn't you? That's it. I've had enough. What are you going to do? Is it clear? Answer me when I talk to you. I don't think it's fair I didn't ask for your opinion. I'm asking if you know who calls the shots in this house. You That's better. Dad please, could you give me my phone? Excuse me? Could you give me my phone? Hey, what a suprise! I thought you were going to call me later. I haven't left yet and I'm already missing you How was dinner? Javi? Javi are you there? My son doesn't want anything to do with you. Do you understand that, faggot? Where are you going? To the street. Sit down Sit down! I'm leaving. Please, could you give me my phone? If you leave now, don't come back. Now put on the table all the things which are not yours. Have you forgotten all the things you mother and I gave you? Come one, the watch the house keys Now go. Javier, please sit down and obey your father. You are right mum. Please?- Don't be pathetic! Get out of my house! The earrings were from my mother. Good night. To Victoria Gardyn and all the mothers who make light out of fear. Drive. In psychoanalysis, a deep instinctive urge that guides behavior towards its own satisfaction. Hi, I'm here to check the gas. Come in. DRIVES -This is a nice house. -Thank you. -What'll it be? -Whatever you like... -I don't care. -Me neither. You can pay now, so that's out of the way. You get full service for that. -Where shall we start? -I'm Carlos. I forgot to introduce myself. Nice to meet you, I'm Cristian. - You must be wondering... - Look, if you wanted "weird" you should've asked the agency. I don't do "weird". I just want to know if I fancy men. Don't you know yet? I've only had one girlfriend, I've been with her seven years and it's just not that great... Look, her name is Carolina. We met our second year at college. She is an interior designer. I'm getting married in a month. I think I love her but... What do you want me to do? I have drives. -Drives? -Gay drives. Gay drives. In high school it was Enrique Jimenez, at college, it was Fernando Gil... my business professor, Enrique Morente, my swimming coach... I thought I'd sleep with a professional and get it over with. But... what if you like it? Well... then I'll have a problem. Active or passive? I see myself as active, but Carolina says I'm sluggish. I mean, who screws who? Oh that! -What's best for you? -I don't care. Touch me. -Can I kiss you? -No. It is too intimate. It's just... What if I touch myself? Should I whack off? Should I do it alone or will you be joining me? -Should I say stuff? -Such as? Like "fuck me", "break my ass", give me your spunk... Don't stick your tongue in, that just grosses me out. What if I suck you off? It's a kind of shock therapy but it may work. No drive at all. I get turned on when I get to know someone, I'm not into this animalistic sex. Did I just offend you? No, I'm thinking. I don't know what else to do. I think I may not be gay. We need to make sure. It wouldn't be fair on you or her. This is personal. -Is Cristian your real name? -No. What is it? -I'm not telling you. -I knew it. It doesn't suit you. I know a Cristian at work, it reminds me of him. Where do you work? -Must I tell you? -Not really. I better not, word spreads. I work at a big insurance company. It's a steady job, with yearly bonuses. -Sounds great. -Yeah, Carolina's thrilled, but I'd rather do something else, I don't know. We never know what we want. - Will you tell Me your name? - Don't be such a pain. -But I told you mine. -I didn't ask you. - Can I call you Antonio? - Antonio, Miguel, Pedro... Antonio will do. Or you can call me "whore, "queer", "bastard"... -Do people call you that? -And worse. -They're crazy. -You have no idea. Why do you do it? Are you an actor down on your luck? - I studied Spanish. - How did you get into this? I've always gotten by this way. When I failed an exam, I'd give the lecturer a head job, or a cheeky smile, or show him my dick. No way! I'm a professional. This is how I got my degree, my driver's license... I paid my flat and everything. So I decided to take it seriously, and work with the agency. Ever think of changing jobs? I'm alright, and I'm used to it now. I'm tired of all this groping. Let's do something else. I never thought I'd get married, but, I've got a permanent job, a 60-year mortgage, a car I've just paid off. After 7 years with Carolina... Everything was fine, then this came up. You're just insecure, "so you come up with these ""drives""." Honestly, what's so strange about being turned on by men? It's normal. The psychologist said... Look, this is my job and I have a girlfriend. -You don't like men? -Not at all! Does she know about this? No, I told her I was unemployed. You should tell her, for yourself, not for her. You must be really confused. I don't want her to leave me. This whole rent boy thing is a turn on for girls, because you have a big dick, you're good in bed, you're sexy... They take what they want and then leave. And you're left alone. I'm tired of that. Look, man... I think you're a really great guy. -Are you serious? -Yes, I really am. My name isn't Carlos. My name's Guillermo. Mine's Felix. Did you like it? What? Did you feel the drive? I don't think I'm gay. I don't think so either. -Thank goodness! -You can say that again. Thanks, you're a real pal. You're welcome, it's no big deal. Here. - It's yours, you've earned it. - We're friends, I can't charge you. Plus, I only did it to help. - What about the agency? - I'll say it was a bluff and you never opened the door. Well, thank you very much. Good luck with the wedding. Good luck to you too. Hi. I came to check the gas... -Can I get you anything? Coffee? -I'm fine. -What should we do? -I don't care. I don't either. Have you had any drives? Guillermo Martín and Carolina Hernández were married the morning of the 24th of October. 320 guests attended... I don't want to lose this emotion this sensation, this fear this liberty, this adreneline. I have no idea what I can do if I stop This is my life, and I love that. I have two mothers and they are together since 37 years I won't watch him It would make me feel ill You've always been a bit scared Of course I'm scared He's my son 'My little boy will fall down' Go ahead. Tease me I'd like to see you teaching young people It's too soon Yes, perhaps it's too soon I don't feel ready to let go yet I understand that It's difficult to say 'Is that it?' Is now the right time? Should I pass it on? In the circus profession, as the supporting acrobat... ...you say 'I'm stopping because I can't do it anymore' The body tells you Yes it's the body telling you Sebastien you have to stop Until then, you carry on There is an injustice to have to stop Because it is your body that tells you So is it okay or what? It's not fair It's not fair to tell yourself... ...'my body doesn't allow me' if in my head I feel fine I feel I have the body of a 20 year old No, but... It's gonna take at least two hours before I get home. Yes, but what do you... Yes, but I can do that on the way. I'll call you back... I can't talk right now.
