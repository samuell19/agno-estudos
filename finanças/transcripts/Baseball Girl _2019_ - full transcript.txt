How can a woman play on the high school team? That's what made her famous. She can throw at a speed of 130 km/hour. Only a few female players in the world can do it. Please smile! Okay!

First, you have to pass preliminary file filtering. I saw your announcement. The announcement did not include file filters. Trial differs from selection. It is conducted internally by the team. We cannot accept all applicants. The rule only exist this time. Well.Thanks. Okay,You're welcome. You took it so seriously! Think you will get a call from them? Why? You need more failure experience. I know if I pass or fail, but from the look of the person who received the audition form. Because of that you all failed? Push here. Gosh, Han Bang-Geul. You said you were going to buy me a new guitar. What are you doing? Not writing new songs? Hey, Audition is about dancing. You don't know anything about my field. What don't you know? All right, clever. What is this place, by the way? See all janggu and hanbok. Do they teach traditional dances? Yes, but nobody's interested so, they teach modern dance at night. Jeez. Can you play baduk? Joo Soo-In, please focus and look at this. Korea Women's Baseball Association The women's baseball league is now active with lots of international competitions. Maybe you can enjoy it as a hobby, Or more than that? What do you think? It takes a lot of money to play baseball as a hobby? Yes? - Ms. Kim. Please come in. - Hello, Coach Park. This is Ms. Kim Ji-Hye, who teaches Japanese. - Hello. - Hi. - Please sit. - Thank you. I don't know if you already know. She is on the women's baseball team. Is it the national team? Yes. National women's baseball team. She knows more about women's baseball than I do. If you are curious about anything, ask her. Joo Soo-In, don't you have any questions? No, I have no questions. Do you think of doing anything other than baseball? No, I'm going to continue playing baseball. Then ask Mrs. Kim about it. She came because of you. I'm thinking about trying to get into the professional team. You mean trial? Yes. Coach Park is working on it for you, but you're not serious. Is this a joke to you? I'm not kidding. What? I'm not kidding at all. Do you want to be a professional player or not? Yes. Do not speak nonsense! Then look at the pamphlet. Why? No matter how hard you try, you can't. There's no point in trying. Ms. Kim. Please explain to her. Well. How do you know? How do you know if I fail or not? Why say it is not possible before even trying? You think you're different, don't you? Do as I say before it's too late. Run faster. Okay, run! Hey, Give me the baseball bat! What? Come on. Will you catch my ball? Well. What are you doing? Hurry up and do it! Slow down.

Yes, I can practice a lot more and try to be selected. Many players do. Is the job search period determined for school over? I told my boss about you. My boss said he invites you to an interview. I don't want to graduate like this! So what? You've been playing for years. One more year won't make a difference. Can't you see your father? It's not a shame to give up if there's no hope. Come on, Let's finish. Yes, Sir. What are you doing? What are you doing with that? If you throw the ball 150 Km/hour If you throw the ball 150 Km/hour What? If I can throw 150 Km/hr, other things don't matter right? 129 Km/hour He shouldn't have recruited that girl from the beginning. As a new team, She needs media attention. Coach Park hasn't changed at all. That's why he can't work with the pro team. It's not that simple. Maybe this place was better for someone like him. It's just a country high school. You live like this, for thinking like that. So find connections and make me like a pro coach. Nonsense. Even the college team won't accept you. I told you to take a degree and prepare to train. You play with little talent up to over 40. It is impossible for you. Stop nagging me, You bastard! - Hey! - What? I can't join the pro team because of a bad recruiter like you. Bad recruiter? What's the speed of your throw? Your throwing speed can't make you a pro, idiot! What are your plans as a professional player? Um...I... I will work harder to become a better player. What's your secret to staying fit? Only... Joo Soo-In. This reporter wants to speak to you. It's an honor to meet a famous player. May I have your time? No, thank you. Mr Lee Jung-Ho said you were throwing faster from junior high school. I caught the ball a few days ago, It's speed was 130 km hour. 130 Km/hour? Is it true? Wait a minute, Miss Joo Soo-In. Wait a moment, please! Hey, wait! Where are you going? You can talk about your situation in the interview. Is it amazing for me to be able to throw 130 Km/hour? Why? Why is that amazing? Joo Soo-In, We have to talk. You misunderstood. That's not what I meant. I had a bigger hand when we were in middle school. I was taller. And it's better to play baseball. Sorry, I am late. It won't happen again. Just transfer the money next time. It's easier for both of us. I'm going to start training. That's Coach Park's high school team. Finally, it worked for you. What do you mean? You also throw and train on an independent team, oppa. It also worked for other players. Training is your specialty. See you later. Get together, everyone. Get together, everyone. You were supposed to do individual training yesterday. But no one practiced. Missed training when Coach Park wasn't around? Laziness because it's cold outside? Run 50 laps around the field. Everyone go out! Hey, Joo Soo-In, come here. Why are you here? Sorry? Last year, you didn't have to come for group training. Take your stuff and go. It does not mean I can't come. Hey! What are you doing? What makes you special to act like that? If you're that good, throw 150 Km/hr and join the pro team. If you can't, then learn to accept. Tell them to come in. Run alone if that's what you want. Go out! Hey, Joo Soo-In! It is enough. "National Women's Handball Team Selection competition" I bet people are stubborn like Coach Park would resist. You know, getting recruited by a pro team isn't that easy. You know that better than anyone else, right? Joo Soo-In said she couldn't take part in off-season training. So, you made her change mind at that point. But it should be better tell her to do another sport. This is school and teachers should fix that. Do you understand? "131 Km/hour" She won't stop even if we stop. It will be a bigger problem if she's injured. About 96% of baseball players will quit one day. You don't need to worry. If it makes you worry tell her to take the test. Maybe she will compromise and choose handball. It's not easy to notice, but Joo Soo-In has a good round score. Don't let boys enter the practice room. - Yes, Sir. - Give me that, and... Check Joo Soo-In's file on my desk. Bye, Go inside. Be careful, sir. Good morning, sir. Your hands are too tense because they hurt. Why don't you come off-season training? You have to pay for it. I have to pay more because... .. can't share the room. You said you wanted to be a pro. I also just wanted to be a pro. I have to do everything for that to happen. What if you fail like me? Isn't it better to give up? Not. I won't give up before I try. Joo Soo-In, follow me. "Application for first trial" Why are you doing this? I'm just asking you to give her a chance. No big deal, right? Does she look like a baseball player to you? If I let her join the trial So what? Jin-Tae, this isn't for me. Get up, man! Ask anyone does she look like a baseball player? You think baseball is some kind of circus? Excuse me. What did you say? Why did you bring me here? You said you wanted a trial. I thought you would give up when I saw the reality. When I played baseball as a kid, other kids want to grow up and become a pro. But I do not. Why? Everyone says I can't play baseball once I entered high school. But it's all lies. How do they know my future? Even I don't know what my future will be. Coach Park called me yesterday. What for? He told me to stop being pretentious and asked you to train me. How can I help you? I could be the trainer myself if I knew. I can't even get to the pro team. Is that okay with you? I'll be a pro for you. It sure can. Joo Soo-In, Spin rate: 38.74 Throwing speed: 125 km/hr High school sprinter and marathon winner can run 100 meters. But who will win? What is that out of blue? Try it. High school sprinter? That's right. What if a marathon medal winner practices 12 hours a day for a year. Then who won? I have no idea. The sprinter still wins. Why? The strength of the marathon runner is endurance, not speed! Direct speed can be a weakness for marathon runners. You never get rid of your weakness. Otherwise, You have to develop your strength points. Strength point... What is your strength point? So what? Your strength make you got a good round score. We combine that... with a knuckleball, a ball without a spin to disturb the bat's timing and balance. But knuckleball is for injured players. You can beat other players with speed and power? - I prefer fast balls. - See... In the end, the shooter with the fast ball wins. What's important is not that you throw the ball fast, but to make it hard for the hitter to hit my ball! But a knuckleball thrower will not be elected in elections or trials. You don't know? Then you can be the first. 15.02 seconds, Do it again! You failed, faster! This hurts. No, your shoulders are too tense. Because it feels stiff in here. Real Estate Permit Exam Sample Questions Dad, what are you doing? I don't need them anymore. Why? You don't study anymore? Father will definitely graduate tomorrow, so I don't need it. What if you fail again? You always fail exams. I will definitely pass this time. Do not worry. You trust me, right? Yes. I trust you. Dad, do you trust me too? Of course. You're the most valuable thing in my life. Jeez. Why are you here? You like him?! I'm here to practice. Do not bother me. I give her special training, don't disturb! You're too close! Gosh. What's wrong with him? Are you ready? Once again. Is this necessary? Joo Soo-In is famous for her fast balls. Why not just that. I can't do it well. It's because your hands are small. Because they are too small, your finger can't push the ball forward. That's why you don't have enough turns You try throw a fast strong ball like a man. But the knuckleball is different. Keep your shoulders and arms relaxed. You said knuckleball is for injured people. How about my little hands? You have to practice with nails. Hold your hand under the stitches, and push the ball out. Got it? How was it? It was better, right? What happened? How can the ball move like that? I almost missed it. Hey, Lee Jung-Ho. What happened again? Get into hitting position. Do something while you're here. What is this? What? You asked me how. You gotta strike that guy. Only with a knuckleball! Hey, grab the bat and get ready. I want to go. Eat this first. I have a baseball game tomorrow. I have to write the syllabus for next semester and semester report tonight. Sorry, for wasting your time. Not at all, I enjoyed it. Joo Soo-In. Fighting! See you later! Hey, Lee Jung-Ho. Eat your meal soon. Come on. So, you guys play together since the minor league team? Yes. Looks like Joo Soo-In is the only girl too. Yes, boys don't like and teased her. Why? Our coach said bad luck to see women in the morning. But he couldn't force her to stop, So, he made group training for to stop her. But Joo Soo-In didn't give up. After all, like that. Hey, you bullied her like other kids? No, I was small and weak. Joo Soo-In was much better at baseball than I was. I didn't want to play baseball in high school. I thought I had no talent. Then I entered the same high school as Joo Soo-In. and don't want to lose. So, I tried hard. What is wrong? Isn't this our house? I have no idea too. I just came. Father! - What happened? - Take care of your sister. Your husband has been preparing for the exam for a long time. It must be hard for you. Since the economy is now deteriorating, many agents help people to cheat on exams. What will happen to my husband? It looks like your husband is just one of the clients. But we have to investigate again. Joo Soo-Hyung. Why eat fast-food? - Where's your sister? - I have no idea. When did she leave? I don't know. No one was home when I wake up. What are you doing? What happened to dad? What are you doing? There is nothing. I just have some business. What business? You want to go to college like everyone else? Or work? What is so important, that you left your sister alone? Do not talk like that. I have business too. What are you doing? Give it back! No, my baseball glove. You ruined it. I told you, it's nothing to be embarrassed about to give up when there is no hope. You don't have to be stubborn and fight for it. Life is hard itself. Why you make it harder?! What do you mean? Mother. You don't know anything. What do I not know? I'm your mother! You don't know how I'm capable of. If I be really good at it, Then, how? So it's not fair. You would be somewhere else if you're good. Those who will play baseball on your team it's almost there. Why don't you know this? You are free to do anything. Why can't I? How dare you... talk to your mom like that? It is true. All you want is money. Is there anything else you would like? Or want to be? All that matters to you in the world is money. I don't want to live like you, I do not want to worry about money all my life. You think I want to live like this? Do you know what I want to let go? I had a life before you were born. If you want to have a selfish life like your father, then leave here now. You want mine? Why didn't you come to our home last night? I failed the audition. Have you got the results? That's the annoying part. They called all who proposed. Then? They got us lined up, and reject us by appearance. Damn. They see your dancing or singing? I'm training hard. It's cold here. Let's go. Aren't you coming? You can't come, can you? Okay, Come on. Jeez. Please sit. Sorry I'm late. It is okay. We don't accept anyone without a certificate, but your daughter is an exception. You have to thank your mother. All office workers, must have previous experience in foundry. All have to work in the field for 6 months. Do you understand? - Yes. - Well. This is the equipment. There is a lot of oil and iron powder in the factory, so you have to wear this uniform. I'm not sure if it will fit you? Try it. Give me your bag. Does it fit? What do I look like? Please take care of her. I have to go. Well. Mother! Eat your meal. Soo-Hyung, call your father. Father! Your father, is he back home? Yes. I go out for a moment. Where are you going at night? I have to train today. What? What do you mean? What? I said, what are you doing? What's my fault? I do everything you want. I pay for my own life as you ask, now leave it alone. Stop now! They say I have to work in a factory for 6 months, before I work at the office. There's a match coming up. What would you do? There she is? Hey, Do you come? Please be nice to her. She is beautiful. Okay. Hey, what is this? Sometimes it helps to watch independent team matches. Just tell me. What do you want? All players are here played for the pro team, or want to play. It's a trial for her. If you think she's not good enough after seeing today. I won't ask you again. Okay? Strike. Strike. Not bad. Maybe because of practicing with the boys. But your throwing arm is so weak. You have to be quick and furious. You need strong thigh muscles to throw a ball fast. Train your thigh muscles. And deltoid. Look at this? All about strong muscles! You don't always have to throw the ball fast. Yes! Very nice! - Can I eat now? - Yes. Enjoy your meal. Are you happy that you won? You got 8 hits, you know. It's fun, and you buy me meat. Here you are. What is this? A gift. Is this for me? This is better than the last prize. Then practice harder. Thanks. I still have one more gift for you. What is that? I talked to my friends on the pro team. You have a trial in a month. Really? Hey, that is all? I thought you would be happy. Jung-Ho, come here. You're late. Sorry. The meeting is backwards. I invited him. He signed a contract with a pro team today. Can we have more meat? Joo Soo-In, wait a moment! I have something for you. This is nail polish. This protects your nails when you throw the knuckleball. Oh, well. You know what? Among the minor league team members just you and me still play baseball. I have to go. Hey. Sign here. I've never signed a ball. I never asked for autographs from a pro either. Thanks. Also for nail polish. You startled me. What are you doing? Where were you? What is this again? You can't just disappear during work hours. The whole company is angry. You didn't answer the phone either. What is wrong with you? Fine, I understand. Stop it. No, you don't understand. You'll find easy work after a few months. Why can't you do it? Mother... I don't want to fight with you right now. What? Please leave me. Please! Move faster! You can not make it that speed. I can not. You didn't even go half of the distance. I don't wanna stop until you get faster. Come down again. Catch the ball well. You... Yes, it is true. Keep practicing. Ouch... Good, you're almost there. Hooray! I did it! Does this make them pretty? Not. Not beautiful? Just make them stronger. Joo Soo-Hyung, The breakfast is ready. - You slept with your sister? - Yes. She has to leave for work, so wake her up. She's not home. Why? I have no idea. -Who are you calling? - I will kill him. What are you doing? Stop it. Stop what? Give it to me. Please, stop it. What is wrong with you? I'll make money. So, stop this. What do you mean? You're angry with me. Get angry with me, not Soo-In. This is not fair. What's not fair? Please grow up! You should be on my side. You know what will happen, If we don't stop her. Have you ever seen her while Soo-In play baseball? Have you ever seen her playing on her high school team, just once? Getting into the team was tough enough. Do you understand? For her, it is difficult to stay in the team. We should help her. We're her parents! We should help her, not telling her to stop like everyone else. Why are you out here? There's no reason. Look at her. She is the hitter on the American amateur team. I heard she had a hard time getting this opportunity too. 9.87 seconds. - Hello, sir. - Oh, You come. This is Soo-In's mother. Hello. Please sit. Curveball, 128 Km/hr. Next... Jung Jamie. Ready. Do it! Jeez. Next.The thrower, Joo Soo-In. Target the strike zone. You can throw another, too, if you are not prepare the throw we asked for. Got it? - Yes, Sir. - Let's start. Left down, fast ball. Fast ball, 134 km / hr. Right side, slider. Slider, 117 Km/hour. Lastly, top left, curveball. Curveball, 101 Km/hr. - 101? - So bad! I thought my throw would be 101 too if I was a girl. Next, the hitter Hwang Seung-Chul. - What? - Me? You're lucky. Don't make it difficult. Your throw is slow but the spin is good. Thank you, sir. Strike 2. Strike 3. Hey, coach Kim. Yes, Coach. Is that the woman who joined the high school team? Yes. It's interesting. Hey! Yes, Sir. How much will you get this year? Me? Yes, you. How many? This year... About 1 million. Okay, you hit the bat. Sorry? Are you serious? This bastard... That's Park Woo-Jin, right? Why is he there? Because he's a fool who can't hit a woman's throw. Hey! What are you doing? This isn't funny at all. It's not like that. Sir, You can't make jokes on players who tried hard to get this opportunity. Is this the so-called a pro team? - Are you her coach? - Yes. So shut up and watch. Let's play. Joo Soo-In, Fighting! Joo Soo-In. Throw like our practice. Start! Strike! What the hell? Wait a moment, Please give me a break. Break time! What happened? I need baseball gloves greater than these. - What? - I don't see it. You need big gloves for a throw of 100 Km/hr? No, I mean... She throws a knuckleball. Even a knuckleball catcher needs bigger baseball gloves. Strike 2. Foul. Okay, I understand. Joo Soo-In, Fighting! You can! Out! Hey, Coach Kim. That's not a knuckleball, is it? That's a 130 km/h fast ball. Damn it. I said I didn't want to do it. So nice! - Good work! - Yes! I have something to ask. Yes. I'm not sure if it's okay for her to do a trial for the pro team. This will give her false hope. I don't know if it's possible for women. The chance of her joining the pro team is very low. What? But it's not because Soo-In is a woman. As you saw earlier, being a pro is also difficult for men. What if you give her a chance? Soo-In said she wouldn't give up. It's not fair to her if someone else determines her future. When you were younger than Soo-Hyung... You and I were returning home by train. You stared at a child eating ice cream. When we got to the station, you kept seeing the kid. You didn't even see me go. You keep staring that kid. So? I could buy you one, but it seemed like a waste of money. I thought the ice cream was too expensive You know what I did? No, I don't remember. I held your hand and scolded you said seeing people is a bad thing. I yelled at you in front of everyone. Honestly, I'm mad at myself for being stingy Just for an ice cream. But I blame you. I... ...I am sorry. What are you doing, Dad? I'm just checking something. Father. Yes? Do you want to be my agent if I become a pro? No, I can't want you this. But you are a good negotiator. You knelt down and asked to make me the first 20-years-old high school baseball team female player. What is that? Do you want to help me? I want to install an application... Let me see. Map app? Press here. Is this? You will get a letter of acceptance from college, Are you happy? You're going to be graduated soon, Are not you? - Yes, Sir. - So, keep going. Yes, Sir. Then, Joo Soo-In? So, are you going to join the pro team or not? Wow. Don't say her "wow"! You don't need to practice anymore, do you? You said that was a good thing. It is not like that? Even stupid people can't throw with bloody hands. Look who's talking. What about me? Don't you remember the first time you learned guitar? Calluses on your fingers will get better soon when you stop playing. Joo Soo-In, come to the principal's office. Why did he call me? - Hey! - What is this? Come on, quickly! You did a great job. I'm proud of you. What happened? The team director wants to see you. Everything will be alright. She's Joo Soo-In. Hello, please seat. Hello. Please. Mr. Kim told me a lot about you. He says you are so famous. Me? Not at all. I heard you're about to graduate from high school. Congratulations. There's nothing to celebrate. Why not? You can do whatever you want or be whoever you want. I hope it comes true. Isn't it hard being a baseball player? I was luckier than the others, but that's okay. Luckier than others... It takes more than luck. Your success is incredible. The world thinks only the men can play baseball, but you proved it is wrong. Accepted into the men's baseball team, is not luck. Here, look at this. What is this? This is our offer. You broke the baseball stereotype. "Teamwork Contract" You proved sports aren't just for men. We want to create a foundation for everyone to enjoy baseball. I want you to take the responsibility for a women's baseball project and work with us. It's a task force that manages and runs the team. Even though you're a woman, your understanding of baseball is good. You also have a long career as a player. So, you have a lot of knowledge. We think it's your ability and are willing to use it. Sir, did you see my test video? Yes, I saw that. Is my game that bad? In baseball, They say you should pick a 160 km/h throwing player Even if you're in trouble. About 70% of wins come from fast and strong thrower. Throwers like that, what we call 'white hope.' Do you know what I mean? Yes. Baseball... It's not just about being a pro. Ms. Joo Soo-In, being a woman maybe was your weakness in the past. But, we think this can be your strength to work on this project. My strength? Yes. "Teamwork Contract" But that's not the right answer. Sorry? I heard baseball is not an easy sport. The important thing is not that you can throw the ball fast, but this makes hard for the hitter to hit my ball. And baseball is for all. Then, being a woman or man... is not a strength or a weakness. I have a pretty good round average. I can combine it with a knuckleball, to disturb the bat's timing and balance. I'm weaker and slower than other throwers. But, I can win. I'm slow, but I can win. That's my strength. I have to go. Good bye. Excuse me. Wait a moment! Ms. Joo Soo-In, you can't go like this. This is a great opportunity. Opportunities like this are rare. So now you see me as a baseball player? What? Ha-Sol. Yes mommy? - Do you like that? - Yes. You can try out for another team. Maybe you can go to the US or Japan. What is your plan? I have no idea. Come over here. What is that? Look at this. It's recruitment season. This person is one of the new players is going to join our team next year. "Baseball Team Application" I heard her table is full of your photos. Thanks to you, She is suggested. It's me. Can I meet you tomorrow? Yes, it's about Joo Soo-In. Yes, good. "Player Contract" This is our offer. The deposit is 60,000 dollars. I already gave it to her. This is not a bad offer for minor league pro players. Pro player? Yes, Soo-In will be a pro. I'll do whatever it takes for her to play baseball, but 60,000... We're not so rich. Sorry? I can't give you this money right now. If you give me a month, not two months, I will prepare it. I'm really sorry, sir. Mother, you are wrong. They will give you 60,000 dollars. It is true. But ma'am. From now on... It will be even harder for Joo Soo-In.
