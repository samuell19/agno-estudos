Please come in. Didn't Mr. Girdharilal come along? He never accompanies me. He accompanied me only on his second marriage with me. Thereafter' he has been busy working. It's good to be busy working. Nonsense! It was Pappu's birthday. I asked him to get many toys for Pappu. But he bought some stupid toy from somewhere' which also broke. Since then' he's been pestering me . . . to come to your shop and buy toys. Come' Pappu. Move! What are you waiting for? Careful' Pappu. Take whatever you like. Gaikwad' show some toys to the kids. Want this elephant' kid? Take. See this jeep' it runs very fast. Take it' son. - See this train. It goes chuk-chuk. Want this too? Take. What do you want' kid? - Mom' shall I buy this horse? Shut-up! You have grown so big and still want to play with toys? I won't buy it for you ! Pappu' buy that one too. Madam' your packets. Take this horse. - But. . . It's a gift from me. - You are spoiling him. Though you spoke in his interest that he is a big boy now . . . and therefore should not play with toys . . . but why are you giving the world a chance to say . . . that he is your step-son? Take it. Pappu' carry the parcels. Move! The elephant died' how can he fight now? The elephant broke his leg and fell down. Papa has come! What have I bought for you? - What have you bought' papa? First give me a kiss. Look. - What a lovely toy. Shall I show it to mom? Mom look' papa has bought such a lovely toy. Isn't it lovely? People talk to God' and my Bitto talks to her dead mother. Wish my Bitto could get a real mother. But if that real mother is not good' . . . her life will become miserable. My daughter doesn't lack anything. I am her mother' I am her father. Right' child? Master' my hand ! ''With small dreams in her eyes'' ''And wings of sleep on her arms'' ''My darling daughter swings on the moon'' ''O moonlight' rejoice! '' ''She is the only bloom in my garden'' ''She is the only pearl I found in the sea of life'' ''I will give her so much love' it will become a phenomenon'' ''O moonlight' rejoice. . . . '' Elephants' horses' palanquins. Hail Kanhaiyalal ! Master' she is a kid now' so you can dress her up. You are giving her a bath' changing her clothes. But when she grows a little older' . . . how will you perform a mother's duty? I understand' Dayal. When you do understand' when will you get married? Papa' when will I get married? Now give her an answer. First papa will get married. A new mother will come for you. When will I get a new mother? - First papa will select a mom. A procession will be taken out. The band will play. Then' your mom will come home. And you will be very happy. Enough of day dreaming. Now go and cook. Give it to me. It's my brother's letter. And the other one is for master. Manmauji. . . . .come here and listen to me. Go to the grocer and buy two kilos of lentil. What lentil? - Yellow lentil. Tell him he is adulterating his products these days. He adds red colour to red chillies. Adds yellow colour to turmeric. If he doesn't give quality species' I'll grind him to spice! Go and tell him that! He adds stones to the cumin. My brother's letter. ' Hello' brother. ' Hello. ' I am fine and happy here' - As if I am unhappy. ' I hope you' Mr.Amar and Aarti must be fine' Yes' everyone is fine. ' I am sorry to write this' . . . ' ' but please send me Rs. 100 more this month' I am more sorry to hear that I should send you Rs. 100 more. I don't own the Reserve bank to just withdraw money and send you. Send what? - Sir. My brother has asked for Rs. 100 more this time. How can I send him more money when I don't have any? If he has asked for it' you'll have to send. He is doing his graduation' and Bombay is not a small town. Even water is bought with money there. Did the dog give you the letter? Yes. It was from Kamla. She is coming for tea tomorrow. Kamla is coming? Surprising. Avoiding the issue will not do. We won't take no for an answer. You will have to marry. That is my opinion too. A man cannot take a girl's responsibility. Having a lady in the house is very necessary. Aunty' shall I feed a biscuit to the dog? Yes' sure. Sister' having a lady in the house is very necessary. Even I am of the same opinion. You are asking me to commit suicide. Is getting married committing suicide? You are always talking nonsense. I'm not talking nonsense' it's a fact. Lord Ram went into exile because of his stepmother. Kunal's stepmother snatched his eyesight. Take our neighbour Girdharilal's son. How much his stepmother troubles him. Do you know' the cruel lady once burnt his hand with a hot spoon. Amar' all stepmothers are not alike. Even I had a stepmother. She had given me so much love' perhaps my own mother would not. Even today when I think of her' my eyes brim with tears. He weighs everyone in the same scale. I wouldn't tell him if he had many children. But she's an only child. Besides' you are still young. That is why I'm insisting. The house seems so desolate. Master leaves for his office and Bitto goes to school. And I am left alone in the house. When I get fed-up' I start barking at the other servants. Good you only bark' don't bite. See! He never takes anything I say seriously. Even I give an ultimatum today. Ultimatum? Yes! I want madam' and Bitto wants a mother! I know Bitto needs a mother. Even I need a wife. But I fear she may make your life miserable. If you keep her in control' why will she? An then' that will come later. I'll manage. Right' brother-in-law? Yes' we'll get a nice girl for your master. I have a friend' Shantiswaroop in Bombay' who has two daughters. They are very nice girls. I have met them. You can marry any one you like. There is a difference of about a year or so in them. Both are beautiful' educated' and good natured. Write to them saying Amar is coming to see the girls. Do write in the letter that the prospective groom has a kid. Why should we hide' we'll take Bitto along. I have already told them this. Just tell me when you are going. A few days before Holi festival. I'll call them and inform them. - Have sweets for this good news. I'll serve him. Dayal. - Yes' master? Do you know what is the deepest? The ocean' master. - Wrong. The depth of the ocean can be measured. Then who' master? A woman's heart. It's depth can never be measured. Master' what's the need to get so deep into anyone heart or brain? There is. I will marry only that girl . . . who will love my daughter. How will you know that? - By posing as a servant. I will come to see the girl posing as a servant. And who will be the master? - You. Me? - Yes' you. You will come as Amar' and I as Dayal. What kind of a joke is this? I am not joking. I need a good mother for Aarti. And this is the only way to check her out. Why do you need to pose as a servant? I am a real servant. I will check her out. - You are good only in the kitchen. Girls are different. Before marriage' all girls pretend they are very innocent. It's only after marriage that their true colours become obvious. Tell me' if kept on the head' will this shoe turn into a crown? This shoe cannot become the crown'but can help get the crown. And it can also make one lose his crown. But master' how do I forget my place? If you want me to come and see the girl' . . . you'll have to do what I say. - But master' I am your servant. How can I order you around in their presence? Alright' forget it then. - No master. . . we'll go. Bitto needs a mother. Here she is. Papa' when will we bring the new mother? From now on' call him papa. - Him? Yes' for a few days. Or you won't get a new mother. Say you will. - Okay. Good girl ! Master' come and take this juice from me. Come and give it to me. - I am standing on the 2nd floor. 2nd floor? - Not 4th master' 2nd floor. Look down. If you are laughing' what will they do? Come here. - How can I? I cannot walk. Seeing this gait of mine' they will kick me out. Master. What are you doing? Remove your hands. After wearing such clothes' I feel I have worn nothing. Unless I don't wear what I normally do' I feel I'm nude. Move your hands. Rehearse for 15-20 minutes and you'll manage. And don't call me master. Get used to calling me Dayal. Alright' master. - Not master' Dayal. That is what I'm saying' Dayal master. Only Dayal' not master. - Yes master' Dayal. Only Dayal ! Master. . . master. Sit down. Drink this. Oh God' I committed no sin. Yet why did God give me this punishment? We are going to have guests in the house today. And I had to get this pain today! Press harder. The knot has gone. - It has? Leave my leg ! Get up! Go! Go! Oh God' you are the only one who I can tell my sorrows. Despite having You' I am an orphan. Am I not destined for even one day of happiness? There was no salt at all. But Shibban' without cream. . . . Yes' madam? - You know we have guests today. Look' cook food for Amar in butter. And if a servant comes along' cook food for him in oil. You understand? - Yes' madam. Bansi' add bathing salts to Amar's bath water. And for his servant? Tell him there is a shortage of water in Bombay. That he can go home and bathe. And put him in the room adjacent to Geeta's. But madam' there is no tube light in that room. Shall I fix a bulb? - Nonsense! We're having power cuts. He'll stay in the dark. What are you making for breakfast? Whatever you say. Pattice' samosas' almond sweets' and whatever else you like. Hurry up' the guests will be here any time. Don't mess up the sweets. - You make the sweets. Move that knife! I'll make the pattice. - Then come. Oh mummy' master has come to teach me. . . how to walk with an enticing gait before the guests. Enough of your gait! Go and get dressed. Master' you please leave. Come! I have never come across a girl like you. Does anyone take so long to get dressed? I don't know what to wear. Wear anything' dear. You are so beautiful. Take' wear this. Wow' this looks good. It does? - Yes. Wear it and come down soon. - Alright. You are still here? And I thought you must have reached the station. Tiwari is not accepting defeat' what do I do? I have a good deal today. Do you have a family or not? Madam' master' the guests have arrived. They have! Tiwari' you continue' I'll join you. Hurry! Welcome! Welcome! I am Shantiswaroop' and she is my wife' Durga. He is my master. . .servant' Mr. Dayal. Not mister' only Dayal. Master' seek blessings. Not me' seek their blessings. -You have a good sense of humour. I'll take your blessings too. Come in. She is my elder daughter' Shobha. And she is my younger daughter' Sheela. And she? - She is our maid. Come. What arrangements have you made for Dayal? Geeta' put his servant in the room adjacent to yours. Go. Please come. This is your room. Here's the broom. Sweep the floor with it. Then put a mattress on the floor and take rest. I live in the room adjacent to this one. My name is Geeta. What is your name? What a strange girl ! She gave me a broom and left? She could have swept. . . - Did you say something? No. I'll sweep the floor. If you need anything' call me. She talks so sweetly. First eat something' then drink milk. Amar' I hope you are comfortable here. Don't embarrass me by saying that. Fragrant water for bathing' wine for drinking. Saffron paste instead of ordinary soap. I have no problems here. Right' dear? Take' mom. - Shobha has made this pattice. Please taste. Wow' it's tasty! I feel like staying here forever. Sheela has made these samosas. Take' eat. It's pungent. - Then have this sweet. My wife has made this. Almond sweet. - You have made it? Yes. - What has your cook made? Just the side dishes. How smart. One must respect a good servant. Shobha' serve Aarti. - Mummy. . . me? Shall I serve you' Aarti? - I'll serve myself' thank you. Madam. . . - Madam? Call me mother. Mother' have you given my servant Dayal something to eat? I'll send something. Shobha' ask Geeta to give some tea to Dayal. Who can I complain to? This was my idea. Tea. - Wow' tea ! It's hot. - It's tea' not a cold drink. Drink it slowly. Sit down. I wanted to ask you something. The two girls my master has come to see' are they good? They are very nice. You saw them. I am not talking of looks. What about their nature? They are good natured. Among the two' who is better? Both are good. One of them must be a little bad? No' both of them are equally good. Shall I ask you something? - Yes. Is your master stupid? What is this you are saying. See! You cannot hear your master's criticism Even I cannot. My master's daughters are much better than your master. No' you misunderstand me. - I understand everything. What is this? Only tea? Do you serve only tea to guests in Bombay? Where is the samosas & pattice? - I'll get it. Be quick. Master. This maid is good. Forget her. Who do you like among Shobha and Sheela? Who do you like? Master' how does my opinion matter? You should like the girl. Who do you like? We'll see. We'll test. You go and rest. Master' I'll sleep there' and you will sleep here? My heart breaks just thinking about it. No Dayal' it's just a matter of a few days. Go and rest. - Shall I massage your legs? No. - Just a little. I'm not in a mood for it. - Just little? Go! I'm sorry' Basmati. My name is not Basmati' it's Geeta. But every fragrant thing has a special name. Because there is a special fragrance about you . . . I have named you Basmati. Shall I say something more? You'll make an ideal wife. You have gone nuts. Look. . .go and get your brains checked. Where do I have brains to get them checked. I only have Basmati ! Be careful in the dark. If you trip and fall. . . I can see very well in the dark. Sleeping in the dark? What are you doing? - There is no bulb in this. I've brought a bulb. Take. Be careful' or you'll get an electric shock. Bansi' switch it on. All the darkness in this house is for the servants. Go and get some cold water from the fridge. Switch the torch off now' the bulb is on. Oh yes. Butter for themselves and oil for the servants. But she doesn't know that I can ignore her orders. Eat well. I have cooked it in butter for you. But that's deceiving your master. The master is himself under a deception. Madam rules the roost here. What is the time in this watch? - 1 1 : 15 pm. It's so late! Go to sleep. I'm not sleepy. That's the problem. Even I am not sleepy. How do the rich sleep on these soft beds? Even a donkey cannot sleep on it. Sing me a lullaby. My mom never sung me a lullaby to put me to sleep. Sing ! - Alright. What happened? - Sing properly. Okay. Don't moo like a buffalo. Sing like my papa. I cannot sing like your papa. I'll do one thing. I'll take you to your papa. He'll sing you a lullaby and put you to sleep. I'll go myself. - You know where he is? Yes. - Then go. Even the young ones have started teasing me now. How do I go to sleep? What have I got myself into. ''She is the only bloom in my garden'' ''She is the only pearl I found in the sea of life'' ''I will give her so much love' it will become a phenomenon'' ''O moonlight' rejoice. . . '' ''With small dreams in her eyes'' ''And wings of sleep on her arms'' ''My darling daughter swings on the moon'' ''O my moonlight' rejoice! '' ''I masquerade for you'' ''I have suffered so much' yet I keep you happy'' ''I wander streets for you'' ''O my moonlight' rejoice. . . '' This is chess' wife! Chess! It can make the best of men taste defeat. Knock off the best of men. That stupid Tiwari has never been able to win against me. Save your knight. What fate! He dreams of chess even in his sleep. Listen ! Shibban' Bansi ! Get up! Why are you up? - I accept defeat! Only in my dream. - I am not careless like you. I was dreaming of Shobha's marriage. What did you see? I saw Shobha is already married to Amar. Congratulations! Morning dreams always come true. You'll see' Amar will marry Shobha. But will Shobha be able to adjust with Amar? Why not? Amar is a very straight guy. Infact' he's dumb. Whereas our Shobha is educated' smart' fashionable. How will their natures match? - Like ours have. Was I fashionable? - No' but I was dumb. I am dumb' and always will be' a henpecked husband. The damned milkman comes so early. I've told him so many times not to come so early. Come after half an hour' then I'll take the milk. You ! I messed it. I thought I was in Bhopal. The milkman came early there. One does miss home. Did you sleep well? - No. . .yes. You were comfortable? - Absolutely. That is what I came to ask. Please go and rest. Here's your tea. - Good. Biscuits too today. Yes. I'd been scolded that day. Sit and have tea. - Won't you have tea? This. . . - Is tea' not a cold drink. Where had you gone early in the morning? I'd gone to your room looking for you. Aarti slept in my room last night. I went to leave her in master's room. Aarti loves you very much. - Even I love her very much. How many children do you have? Children? I myself am a child still. Oh' so you are not married yet. No' but I do intend to get married. But I still haven't found a girl who I like. What kind of a girl do you want? A girl who doesn't let Aarti feel that she's her stepmother. One who looks after the house' . . . and gives all the happiness in the world to Aarti. The way you are talking like as if Aarti is your child. She is. . .I mean' my master's daughter is like my own daughter. Yes. Besides' Aarti is a sweet girl' and very lovable. Some people are like that. So lovable that you have to give your heart to them. Yes. . .that's true. Shobha' our culture and values teach us . . . that a guest is an image of God. To look after him well is our duty. Who knows in what form one may come across God. And then' Amar has come to see you. Me? - Yes. You and Sheela. Whoever he likes among you two' we'll get her married to him. Daddy' who he likes is important. Isn't even our opinion important? When has our opinion ever been important in this house? It is your mother's opinion that is important. Ensure that the guest is well looked after. Is the guest caged? - What do you mean? It's animals who are looked after. Shut-up! Don't talk rubbish. Mummy' his first wife is dead. Now he wants to cause another wife's death. Moreover' he even has a daughter. So what? He is moneyed. Mummy' money is not everything in life. Then what is? - Love. That will happen after marriage. And where his kid is concerned' she'll get married and leave. Then you will rule the roost. ''It's a tradition'' ''Lose your life' but don't break your word'' Why are you sitting on the floor? Sit on the sofa. Come on. What are you doing' sir? You'll land me in a soup. You are the master' I am just a servant. Times have changed. Everyone is equal now. You cook so well. How much do you get paid? I feel embarrassed even it to tell you. You'll feel sad when you know. Only Rs. 50. In a city like Bombay' where everything is so expensive? I have requested madam several times to increase my pay. But she is unmoved. What moved? - Unmoved. Give me some tobacco. - Take. Is there no union of cooks in Bombay? What union' sir? To each his own. I'll teach you how to get a raise. When some guest comes home' tell your master to give you a raise. Or else. . . - Stop work? A complete strike! What act is this? It's not an act' we are on strike. Strike? What do you mean? Hey! The milk is boiling over. So let it.We went on strike after keeping the milk for boiling. Give us a raise! - Increase our salary! You'll get a raise. Today itself! - Yes! Let the guests leave' then I'll give you a raise. Then even the food will be cooked after the guests leave. The house chores will be done after the guests leave. What nonsense is this! Give us a raise! - Increase our salary! Shut-up! You are pressurizing me at a time when I have guests. Give us a raise! - What if I don't? Give us a raise. - Increase our salary! How dare you ! Just you wait! Listen ! . . . Listen ! Coming ! What is the matter? Settle their account and dismiss them! What happened' Shibban? Why are you carrying that pan' Bansi? We want a raise! Alright. They are right. These are inflationary times. Give them a raise. Even we are living in inflationary times. Give us a raise! - Stay quiet! Try and reach a compromise. - I will not compromise! Dismiss these disloyal men ! Give us a raise! Take your money and leave. The flavor of a local cigarette' and the joy of your own room . . . cannot match this imported cigarette and this bungalow. This Dayal. . .can he cook? Ofcourse' mother! When the royal family is having a feast' . . . they call Dayal to cook for them. He cooks so well' people chew their fingers too. Enough ! How much you are praising him? People like you give these servants airs. Gosh ! Gosh ! Listen. Dayal. - Yes' madam? Until your master is here' you will have to cook. Me? - Yes' you. You are no king. You will be a servant wherever you go. But madam' I. . . - No buts. Amar says you are a very good cook. Mr.Amar said that? - Yes' he did. Now go and cook. And listen. Fry the ' puris' well. Yes' mother? I have asked Dayal to cook food. Keep an eye on him. He may steal something. He's not like that. - Is he related to you? His master is a simpleton' but he seems to be very smart. I doubt whether he will be able to cook or not. Amar himself told me he is a very good cook. You go and do the house chores. And listen ! Keep an eye on him. He may add butter to his food. Go. What have you done to the flour? I added a little more water perhaps. Little more water? Mr.Amar has told mother that Dayal cooks very well. Yes' that Dayal cooks very well. That Dayal? Are there two Dayal's in your house? No' I am that Dayal. My master loves to pull people's leg. He sometimes asks me to exchange roles with him. You wash your hands and cut the vegetables. Let's cut the vegetables. You cut your finger! It's not too bad. How compassionate you are. Humans should be compassionate' or they are not humans. Our association of just a few days . . . Just a few days? I feel it's an association of years. That's how good natured people are. You find me good natured? - An angel. Why are you fooling me? Why should I? I said what I feel. What else does your heart feel? My heart believes you are very helping. Forget it. Why are you buttering me? Butter is not applied to people' but on bread. After seeing your looks' I feel like asking you two a question. Go ahead. You know what bitter gourd is? - Yes. How do you cook it? - What? We don't know. - You don't? Every woman must know this. Cooking is an art. Art? It's a fine art. - Absolutely! A woman who cannot cook is like a buffalo without a tail & horns. First saute the lady fingers in oil. I will learn to cook with your help. And I will find life with your help. Shall I put the lady fingers in the pan? Wait. . .wait. I asked you how bitter gourd is cooked and you are laughing. How is bitter gourd cooked? - The cook cooks it for us. What if the cook falls sick? - We'll eat in a restaurant. What if the restaurants are on strike? So? - So? The kids will go hungry. We'll think about it when we get married. But kids will be born after marriage. And in my case' I already have a daughter. Dayal uncle! She sometimes calls me Dayal uncle. What happened to your Dayal uncle? What?. . . Really? Mother' why did you ask Dayal to cook? The poor guy is sick. - He's sick? What's wrong with him? His leg. . . his head. . . he has an upset stomach. The doctor has told him not to cook. What a strange doctor? He's forbidden cooking'but not eating? He's our family doctor. If you didn't have anyone' you should have asked me to cook. You? - Yes' I know to cook. I'll cook food today. Great! You make wonderful ' puris' Whether round or whatever shape' what difference does it make? What are you doing' Mr.Amar? It's me who has cooked all his life . . . Master' that harsh teasing hurts. Let Dayal be Dayal here. But' Mr.Amar. . . Mr. Dayal. . . It's mother who has played this joke' not me. She is not making Dayal' but Amar cook food. One who comes along with the guest is also a guest. You are not well' you go. I'll manage the kitchen. Great cook! Is this a ' puri' or the map of India? What are you doing ! Cooking' and making designer ' puris' for you. You don't bother' I'll make them. I am not just your guest' but also your cook. I am sorry' Amar. I made a mistake. I'll cook. - If you say so. Dayal' you go' you are not feeling well. Take rest. Geeta' you roll the ' puris'' I'll fry them. Mother' I bathe before eating. If Geeta rolls ' puris'' who will ready my bath? Go and get his bath ready. There she comes! What's up? - Help mother make ' puris'. Mother' what should I do? Dance on my head ! Roll the ' puris'' I'll fry them. Dayal has an upset stomach. Just give him boiled rice. Don't give him anything else. Boiled rice. - Boiled rice? But I ate that even in the afternoon. You have an upset stomach. I have an upset stomach? Says who? Your master. - Master. When he has an upset stomach' he says I have it. What is this? Oil in boiled rice? Then will servants be given butter in their boiled rice? Such discrimination has erased the love between master & servant. There is no compassion left between them. Come to Bhopal and see. Both master and servant are treated alike. There is no discrimination. Oh yes' I can see that. You live here' and your master sleeps in the AC room. I am staying here of my own will. Or master wanted me to stay with him. Eat the rice. - I don't like it. But I'm eating it to show respect to a servant's helplessness. I was also hungry. Why did you tease me that day? Am I crazy to tease you' master? Master' how many stumps down? What? - I mean' wickets? Four wickets. Why did you say I have an upset stomach? I said it in fear. Do you know what I had to suffer? - What? What our cricketers are suffering. What happened? - Rats kept running all night. In the stadium? - No' in my stomach. Out of hunger. - I'll cook something for you. You want our secret to be out? I will not cook. I will make some family member cook for you. Not family. . . Did any stump fall? - Stump? No' wicket. So where were we? Family. . . - Not family. . .yes. . . You are not ready yet? We have to go for a movie. Master. . . . Dayal. . .she says I have to go for a movie. How do I go? - Then go! Master' please go. Dayal'don't you know what happens to me after having asafoetida? I get a headache. - You have a headache? I'll get medicine for you. Dayal' a little harder. Come down. Any more fall of wickets? What is it? Dayal' what are you doing on the bed? Master' I was massaging your legs. Get down and do it. Is the pain severe? - Pain? Oh' headache. It's bad. Shall I massage it? - No. How did you get a headache? - It's due to change of weather. The food you cooked has given me an upset stomach. You are right. An upset stomach does give one a headache. I've brought medicine. - He doesn't need medicine. I have brought castor oil. - No' not castor oil ! Drink this' it is very good for the stomach. Drink it' master. - My husband takes it every day. It is very good for the stomach. And look' don't have dinner tonight. Won't I even get dinner? And take' you also have it. Even you have an upset stomach. Master' it is very good for the stomach. I'll take it later. Master' my leg ! My leg ! Master' it's come. Not from there' from here. Alright' go then. Just keep coming and going now. Nothing happened here' but his wicket fell. Strange are your ways' God. Sometimes there is sorrow' and sometimes' happiness. You are aware of everything. Since Dayal has come here' I have a strange feeling in my heart. Even mother's harsh tongue doesn't hurt me anymore. I have never asked you for anything until today. Is it possible that even Dayal feels . . . Who is it? - It's me' Dayal. I cannot sleep. So what can I do about that? I think there is some feeling which I am suppressing. If I reveal it' I'll probably be able to sleep. Shall I say it? Yes. Actually' since I have seen you . . . . I feel something. What do you feel? I don't know. It's. . . it's. . . Don't you feel anything? - Feel what? It's. . . .forget it. . . .I think I'll have to stay up all night. No. Tell me what's on your mind. Geeta' I feel I will go mad. I see stars during day and the sun at night. I see you all around. All the time' I hear only these words from my heart. What? - Geeta' I love you ! I cannot live without you. . . . .I want to marry you. Will you marry me? - Quiet! Dayal' madam will get up. Mr.Amar will get up. Let them get up' I don't care for anybody! I will scream and ask you only one question ! Do you love me? - Yes! Yes Dayal' I love you. But how do I believe it? I will do whatever you say. You will do whatever I say? Alright' then come to the garden with me right now. You go' I'll join you. - Feeling shy to come with me? No. - Then? The form in which I want to present myself before you . . . to see that' you'll have to wait. Wait?. . . .okay. But you will come? This is Your miracle. Dayal is asking me whether I'll really come or not. I can go anywhere in the world with him. I'll just be back.

Tell me' why are you quiet? I will break your legs! You didn't care for our prestige? Hello. - Bless you. I am going to meet Gopinath. Gopinath? And even Tiwari lives along that route. If I meet him' I'll have to say hello. How cruel can you get? Will you do me a favour? - Tell me. Check with the grocer why he hasn't sent oil and butter yet. We have guests at home. Hello' madam. - There he comes. I'm leaving. I seek your blessings. - Bless you. Have you brought all the things in the list? I have brought more than what you wanted. Nonsense! A grocer never gives more. I have brought pure butter. Alright' go and keep it in the kitchen. Madam. - What is it now? Do give a thought to me. Alright' I'll give you a good tip during festival time. Not during festival' I'll ask for a tip on an auspicious occasion. Alright' go and keep the things in the kitchen. Where has everyone gone? They have quit and left. Quit and left? And Geeta? She's here. - Thank God she's here! Whether the others are there or not' who cares! Who are you? The new servant? No' I'm a guest. - Oh' guest. Guest? Whose guest? Geeta's? No' master's. Oh. Then it's okay. That means you'll be here only for a few days. She's come. My eyes were craving to see you. I'll break your eyes! Even after being blinded' I'll look for you. Hey mister! Keep the groceries and leave. What is your problem? Geeta and me have always been teasing each other. Right' Basmati? Jaggu' stop your nonsense' or I. . . Or will you break my head? I will break your head ! Mr. Guest' you break a coconut. That auspicious moment is very near. . . I forgot to get the coconut! I'll get it right away. Hurry up. If madam comes' we'll have a problem. What problem can be greater than the one we already have on hand? Are you hurt? Walk straight! Shall I come? - Yes. Thank you God' for saving my reputation. Had anything happened to you' what would I tell madam? What is Vijay's room number? This is 4 2. This is 4 1. This is 40. But this is locked. Where has he gone? Where do I look for him? Vijay has gone out. If you have any message' I can convey it to him. I don't want any massage. I said message. I can convey it to him. So you have come? - How would I not? Where were you since so many days? A boy has come to see me. We have guests at home. To see you. - Yes. Worried? Shobha has chosen him' not me. But the man is pretty rich. Is it? What if he chooses you? Will you change your mind? Where are you going? Annoyed? - You say such annoying things. Alright' henceforth I won't. Come' sit down. How are you' master? I mean' Dayal. I'm fine' but in bad shape. This charade is too much for me. You got me into it. Now we'll have to continue with it. Master' what are you doing? - It's become a habit. It may become an obsession. So better select a wife for yourself soon' and let's leave. It's not the selection' I want to test her nature. Do it' but make it fast. However long it takes' until Aarti selects her mother . . . we'll have to stay here. - Alright. Bansi ! Is anyone around? - Coming ! Poor master! Can I come in? I have brought tea. - Keep it here. Ms. Shobha' if you don't mind' shall I ask you something? What do you think of Aarti? She's very cute. I feel I should keep her with me always. And Aarti's father? When I like his daughter' why won't I like him? That means you like Aarti's father? But I don't know whether he likes me or not. I'll ask him. - Okay Dayal. . . You ask him and let me know. Your books' Ms. Sheela. I brought all of them. Why are you standing? If you don't mind' shall I ask you something? Yes. What do you think of Aarti? - She's a cute girl. That means you like her? - Yes. And Aarti's papa? - Mom likes him. You mean' you don't like him? Who cares about what I like or not? But he likes you very much. He likes me' he likes Shobha' he likes Geeta' he likes mom. You want to ask anything else? Tell me Aarti' why has your papa pampered Dayal so much? You are not to be told that. - Why not? Come on' tell me. I'll get you a nice frock. I'll buy you sweets' and a lovely doll. Tell me. You won't tell anyone? - No' it will be our secret. My papa. . . . You brazen fellow! How dare you beat the child. I'll go and complain to your master. Get out of my sight! Come' Aarti. Mr.Amar' do you know what happened? Dayal slapped Aarti? Madam didn't tell you anything else? No. What happened? She slapped Dayal. He is crying. That old woman slapped my Dayal? I'll teach her a lesson ! Master! She slapped you? Tell me' have we come here for an alliance or to get slapped? Today she has slapped you' tomorrow she will slap me. And then Aarti. - Listen' Dayal. We will not stay here any more. If you don't come' I'll break my head. There is no need to get angry. So what if she slapped me? She is elder to me' just like my mother. I understand your pain. But don't do anything stupid now. Or Aarti won't get a good mother. Master' the world is so vast. There are so many other women. We'll choose someone else' but let's leave from here. There is no need to make an issue. I understand your pain. But one has to sacrifice to get something in return. Now you calm down. - Master. . . Calm down ! - Alright. Aarti. . .come to me. - I won't' you beat me. Now what? - Sleep is eluding. Go and tell your Dayal uncle. Not me' my doll cannot sleep. Come. How do we put her to sleep? ''With small dreams in her eyes'' ''And wings of sleep on her arms'' ''My darling daughter swings on the moon'' ''O moonlight' rejoice! '' ''She is the only bloom in my garden'' ''She is the only pearl I found in the sea of life'' ''I will give her so much love' it will become a phenomenon'' ''O moonlight. . . '' ''With small dreams in her eyes. . . '' ''Along with the sleep' a prince will come'' ''He will put a vermilion dot' and garland you'' ''And then kiss your pretty face'' ''O moonlight . . . . '' Then what happened? - I didn't know what to do. But then I remembered I had my exam after two days. On the pretext of going to the library . . . I fooled both Shobha and the guest from Bhopal' and came here. Fair maidens. Big mansion. - Not mansion' hotel. Hotel? Where one eats? - Yes. Sit down. You want water? - No. Don't you want to eat? It is good Sheela didn't come with us. You don't understand. Mom is right' you are a simpleton. Do you have a match? - I have this lighter. People in Bhopal don't think I am one. Forget what people say in Bhopal. What is the matter? You look scared. What happened? - Nothing. That's Sheela ! But who is with her? Sheela' let's go. Yes' let's go! Sheela' what are you doing here? I was going to the library when I came across Vijay. He is a fellow student. Vijay' she is my elder sister' Shobha. And he is Amar' a rich man from Bhopal. He's the one I'd mentioned about to you. Oh' so you are that man. Hello. When in college' even we used to go to the lavatory like this. What? - He means library. It's great weather for studying. Yes. - We'll be going. We're getting late. What is the matter? Why are you upset? Let's go home. - But we have just come. What do I say? I am feeling uncomfortable. Alright' let's go home. I've been waiting for you. - I was with master. Take' I've bought you Bombay's special sweets. For me? - Yes. I'd gone to the market' saw the sweets and was reminded of you. It's a speciality of Bombay. - This must be expensive. So what? I have bought it with my money. Take' eat. - Keep' I'll eat it. Why? Any problem if I put it in your mouth? I didn't say that. - Then eat. Like it? - It's good. Got my money's worth. I was thinking if you don't like it. . . It's sweet too. Tell me' what is the sweetest? Don't know? Shall I tell you? Love. You'll have to eat all of this. - Don't you have? You ate it' I ate it! This old woman won't even let me serve you sweets. Finish it' I'll be back. Brother' you? How are you? - I am fine. But when did you come here? About 10- 15 days ago. Shall I ask you something? - Yes. How did you forget that you are a servant's brother? The path you have taken' is it the right one for you? Before trying to reform the young' . . . . the elders themselves must reform. - You are being rude to me! Did I send you here to study or to romance? It's no sin to love. What is a sin is to masquerade as a rich man and cheat someone. To ruin some innocent girl's life. You tell me' are you a rich man? Have you won a lottery? What money do you have? Your brother has won a lottery of loyalty. This shine you see on a poor man . . . is all for my master's sake. Master has come to test Shobha and Sheela. He is going to marry one of them. I don't know who. He is posing as a servant and has put me in a soup . . . asking me to pose as master. And I cannot do a thing. Vijay' I have never cheated anyone so far. Nor have I ever ruined any girl's life. I accused such a good man ! I should be beaten. Don't be stupid. It's not your fault. Anyone in your place would think I'm bad. Forgive me. - Listen to me. Do me a favour. - Just order me. Not order' I request you. Don't say that' I can even give my life for you. Don't say that. May you live long. What do you want me to do? - My heart breaks saying this. I am snatching your happiness from you. But I have to give preference to my master's happiness. You move out of his way. So that master gets a wife and Aarti' a mother. Forget Sheela. Forget her forever. I promise you' brother. I will sacrifice my love for the sake of Mr.Amar's happiness. Look' this is the groom' and this is the bride. They are going to get married today. This is mom' and this is dad. This is grandma' and who is this? Grandpa. Damn your play! Will you make her a maid too? You have grown so big' and are playing with toys? I was only entertaining Aarti. Shut-up! Don't try to act smart with me. Come' dear. Come with me. Don't you dare play with the kid again ! God' what sin have I committed for which I am being punished? Am I so lowly . . . that I cannot even express my love to someone? I have come! You should not come here. - Why? Because madam doesn't like it' she gets angry. Then let her be. I'll come here a 100 times. No' you will not come here at all. Go away. ''Don't come to me' my doll'' ''My sorrow will sadden you'' ''I am the one who has come into this world . . . '' ''only to cry'' ''What is my life'' ''I only exist'' ''I have no dream' nor any hope'' ''Don't come to me. . . '' ''Your eyes craving for love . . . '' ''make me anxious'' ''I cannot give you a mother's love'' ''Even though I want to'' ''I have nothing to give you'' ''Don't come to me. . . '' Hello. Greetings. - Greetings. Come' Dayal. Take. The ' paan' is good. I have come to take leave. - Leave? For what? We want to return back home tomorrow. But you hardly stayed any days here. Have we offended you that you want to leave? No' we enjoyed our stay here. But there is a saying. . . ' Guests are never welcome too long' What is the matter? - They want to go back tomorrow. Want to go back? Why? It's not proper for guests to stay so long. People will wonder if we have come here to select a girl . . . or stay forever. On reaching home' master will convey his decision to you. Why? Is he embarrassed to convey his decision here? Look' it's my silver anniversary on the 25th. We'll think after that. - What is on the 25th? Her silver anniversary. - And not yours? It's the same thing. We will complete 25 years of marriage. She wants to celebrate. Is that so? Then I'll ask master to stay. We will surely join the silver anniversary celebrations. Bhopal may be a small town' but it's a lovely place. Every person there is nice. Everything about that place is lovely. And what do you think of Bombay? If I say anything about Bombay' a bomb will explode here. So let it explode' but you do tell us. Then listen. In Bhopal' when we have a guest' we give him a warm welcome. We offer him everything that we have. Over here'you ask a guest whether he'd like something hot or cold. How can a guest say what he wants? Master' our departure date has been fixed. When master. . . Dayal? After the silver anniversary celebrations of master. I don't understand. It's mom's silver jubilee anniversary. And that too' on the 25th of this month. Hublee? Can't you pronounce Hublee? Not Hublee' it's jubilee. What an illiterate man you ! Will you have a party? - Yes. And music and dance? - Yes. Then your party will be a memorable one. How is that? - My master dances very well. Is it? - He sings very well. He's a great dancer. Yes' I break the floor. He's joking. And when he sings' he receives accolades! Music is in his genes. See how well he sings. What note was that? Angry note. - I think it the note of ruin. ''I have been to many parties'' ''But this is something different'' ''I have seen several beauties'' ''But your style is something different'' ''This evening is an evening of revelry'' ''It's a celebration to remember'' ''An enchanting night'' ''O bartender' I got a drink from you'' ''But also let me drink from your eyes'' ''Let me drink from your eyes today'' ''Your eyes are more mesmerizing than any drink'' ''I have been to many parties. . . . '' ''You are asking for a heart that is not worthy of anything'' ''Your heart craves for something it can never get'' ''All your fantasies. . . '' ''will find a cure' just let that day come'' ''Let that day come' my beloved'' ''My heart is not the cure'' ''Your cure lies with someone else'' ''I have been to many parties. . . '' ''It is my desire' that I see you always'' ''It's all in the hands of fate' you or I cannot do a thing'' ''My eyes say there is no one like you'' ''There are so many beauties here' but you are different'' ''There is no one like you in the whole world'' ''How do I say'' ''What are you'' ''My beloved'' ''I swear! '' ''What you have. . . '' ''You understand?'' ''What you have is something out of this world'' ''I have been to many parties. . . '' Basmati. . . no. . . . Geetu. You have addressed me so lovingly! Where has everyone gone? For an outing. - Wish they never return. Then it will be just you and me. What do you mean? I mean' that we can openly and without caring for the world . . . talk of love. Really? We'll talk of love? Yes Geetu' we have both' the atmosphere' and the opportunity. You brazen fellow! So you'll act tough? Jaggu' leave me! - I'll show you how to love. Jaggu' leave her! I said' leave her! You? - Yes' me. How did you dare to come here? - How dare you misbehave! No one dares to cross swords with me. It is better that you leave. And no one dares to misbehave with a woman in my presence. If you care for your life' just go away. Don't forget that you are a guest in this house. I have been coming to this house since 10 years. No one has objected. And then' this is my personal matter. She is my fiancee. I am going to marry her. Who are you to interfere? Stop your nonsense or I'll punch you in the face! Your threats don't scare me. I will not spare you ! Are you badly hurt? - No' it's nothing. Show me. You are bleeding and say it's nothing? I'll clean it. - No' it's a minor injury. You unnecessarily made enemies with him because of me. After seeing his behavior' any decent man would do the same. He will never dare to tease girls again. I'll never forget this favour. It was no favour' it was my duty. This milk is for who? - For me. No' it's for me. I'll ask you something. Will you give me an honest answer? Yes. - Look at me and say yes. Yes. What do you think of me? - I like you very much. Very much? - Yes. And what does Dayal think of me? -I don't know. You don't know? But I like Dayal very much. And my papa? Not your papa' I like your servant' Dayal. He is my papa. Dayal is your papa? . . . .And Amar? Amar is the fake papa. Why so? You won't tell me? No. - Why? I won't get a new mother otherwise. Not papa' call me Dayal uncle. Aarti' does Sheela love you? Yes' she does. - You like her? I like Geeta. Geeta? Yes' she is a nice girl. You like her? - Yes' I like her. Then make her my mummy. How is that possible? - Why not? She will marry someone else. She is a maid after all. - Can't she become mummy? Yes' she can. I'm busy. You can work later. I'll only take two minutes. Tell me. Children are so innocent. They don't discriminate between class or status. They treat everyone equally. And in their innocence' they speak without thinking. She was telling me yesterday that she'll make you her mother. So what did you say? - I. . . .I. .tried convincing her. That we are only employees. If you don't mind' I know of a good boy. . . . . Enough ! I don't need anyone's pity or favour. Okay' so I saw a dream. Where I saw my destiny shine. But when my eyes opened' . . . I realized that a dream is only a dream. Thank you very much' Mr.Amar. You don't need to worry about me. Leave me to my fate. ''I masquerade for you'' ''I have suffered so much' yet I keep you happy'' ''I wander streets for you'' ''O moonlight' rejoice. . . '' I seek your blessings' madam. Madam' your silver anniversary was celebrated with elan. But I didn't get anything. What do you want? Shall I give you Rs. 2 1? No' madam. - Shall I give you Rs. 5 1? No' madam. - Then what do you want? Just give me Geeta in marriage. Geeta? Yes' or that Dayal will take her away . . . and I'll be left standing and staring. What is this you are saying? - That's what is going on. She wants to marry Dayal. If she wants to marry a petty servant . . . I'd rather get her married to you. Madam' thank you ! May you celebrate a golden anniversary. Shall I fix up a date for marriage? Go ahead. Did You watch me being made fun of? Are you happy now? Are You satisfied' or do You want some more? If You want some more fun' have it. You are a spectator. You love watching people being humiliated. A poor girl is being tormented' and You do nothing about it? If You are God' show me your miracle. What will You do? You are deaf' dumb' a stone idol. Even Your heart is stoned. You have no love' pity' mercy for anyone. Listen. . . Doesn't my leaving hurt you? It hurts me. I have no one but You. You are my mother' my father' my friend' my guardian. You mean everything to me. Alright' don't speak. Even I won't beg before You. I won't plead for mercy. Even I won't cry before You. O stone statue' I am leaving. Madam' I am leaving. Where are you going? - Wherever my legs take me. I know. You want to run away with a petty servant. Neither with the master' nor with the servant. I am going alone. - No' you cannot go anywhere. Your mother had put you in my care. Made you my responsibility. Made you dependent on me. My mother may have made me dependent on you. Maybe she put me in your care' but only to serve you. Shut-up! What nonsense are you talking ! I am not talking nonsense' I am asking you. Who are you to fix my alliance with Jaggu? What right do you have? -You are talking to me like that! You dare to argue with me? What are you doing ! You are saying this? - Yes. Now you are speaking for her? When torture goes beyond tolerance' . . . . even stones break into speech. Geeta's mother didn't tell you to get her married . . . to some idiot like Jaggu. I will get her married to Jaggu. I have given my word to him. Over my dead body! I will get her married to Jaggu. Let me see who can stop me. Master' Geeta was going that way. She was even carrying baggage. She should have left long ago. Why? God should never orphan any child. Geeta is the daughter of Durga's friend. She was only 2 years old when her father died. And after a few days' even her mother died. Before dying' she put Geeta in Durga's care. This shameless woman promised the lady . . . that she'll rear Geeta like her own daughter. But she has tormented the poor girl in so many ways. Where will the poor girl go? I'll go and get her. You don't brother' I'll go and bring her back. Are you inspector Wagle? . . .I am Durga Mathur. My maid Geeta has eloped with the servant of my guest. His name? His name is Dayal Thakur. I don't know what she has taken. But she has run away. Catch her and bring her back to me. Vijay' come and tell Sheela that you cannot marry her. Even I will tell Shobha that I don't like her. Then master will marry any one of them. Come on. Have you changed your mind? - No' not at all. Where are you going? - Wherever my legs take me. The world is vast. - I won't let you go like that. I don't want anyone's sympathy. And then' who are you to stop me? I may not mean anything to you . . . but I have realized today that you mean everything to me. You are imposing yourself on me. I don't want to do anything with a lair. Let me go. - No' Geeta. It's true that I am a lair' but my Aarti is honest. And she has accepted you as her mother. Won't you return even for her sake? Amar' am I dreaming again? No' Geeta. Oh great! You two look like one. Dayal' you bashed me up that day. Today' I have brought so many people to bash you. You were you a grocer. Since when did you become a goon? I'll teach you a lesson ! Police! Run ! Where are you going? Inspector' that goon is eloping with my fiancee. Why do I see only half of you? Because your one eye is shut. Is your name Dayal? - Yes' and she's Geeta. I've received a complaint that you are eloping with the girl. Come with me. Why did you have to call up the police station? Did Geeta steal anything? She has quit the job. It's her wish. Whatever I have done is correct. You don't need to worry. What is it? - Look who's here. Who is it? - Kamla aunty. Welcome. - Welcome. Where is Amar? - He has gone out. Who did my brother select? Shobha or Sheela? He hasn't told us anything yet. Kamla' Shobha has given her consent to marry Amar. But that servant of yours has brought Amar disgrace. Disgraced Amar? What did he do? It's nothing' she's talking rubbish. Oh yes! He'd complain only if Dayal had eloped with Shobha. Who did Dayal elope with? He is a very decent guy. That decent guy has eloped with our servant. Mother. . . .sister' greetings. Where is brother-in-law? - He's on tour. You have become a gentleman coming to Bombay' Dayal ! What game is this? - It's no game. I am Dayal' Amar is my master. He asked me to pose as master . . . . and he posed as the servant. But why? - I'll tell you. To test our daughters. So that Aarti gets a good mother. Madam' Dayal was eloping with Geeta. Tell them' isn't Geeta my fiancee? What are you talking? Dayal is my brother. And the one who he is calling Dayal is my master' Amar. Inspector' Geeta is not his fiancee' he's lying. Put him behind bars! Madam' why don't you say something? She is my fiancee! You claim anyone to be your fiancee! Brother' you had come here to select a wife. Then why this charade . . . of you being the servant' and Dayal the master? I did all this to select a girl. So who did you choose' Shobha or Sheela? Sister' Shobha likes Dayal. And Sheela loves Vijay. Shobha likes Dayal thinking he is you. And who is Vijay? - Dayal's younger brother. Damn ! Even he is a servant's brother? He's doing graduation. - So what? I cannot tolerate my daughter loving a servant. Whether you tolerate it or not . . . ask your daughters what they want. Why are you two quiet? Speak! Yes' I have accepted him as my husband. Even I want to marry Vijay. Shut-up! Quiet you brazen girls! I'll kill you both ! See what your brother has done? Why don't you marry this servant? Yes' I will marry Geeta. But I will not get my daughters married to any servant. Shobha will not marry Dayal. Dayal chose to be a servant. But you have forced Geeta to be a maid. Geeta is your friend's daughter. And Dayal's father was my father's friend. As luck would have it' my father became a rich man . . . whereas Dayal's father died a poor man. With his death' Dayal was left with no means to progress. He has worked hard to make something of his brother. I wanted to help him. But he became my servant instead and supported me. I love Dayal more than I would my own brother. That's absolutely true' Durga. Sister' I'm telling you today. Even Dayal doesn't know this. I have transferred my toy factory in Dayal and Vijay's name. All the income of the factory will belong to them. Master. . . - Call me Amar. Mother' Dayal is a man who is rich and compassionate. I ask for Shobha's hand for my brother Dayal. And ask for Sheela's hand for my younger brother Vijay. No. . never! I will never get my daughters married to these paupers. I will ! I will get Shobha married to Dayal . . . and Sheela married to Vijay. Forget it! Who are you to get my daughters married? Who I am? I'll have to tell you today who I am. After 25 years of marriage you ask me who I am? I am the father of these girls. And your husband ! What are you doing ! Who are you to say anything? I am not saying anything' the father of these girls is. Your husband is saying this! What are you doing ! - You don't interfere. What do you want? You want Geeta to marry that rogue Jaggu? You want to reject these good men's proposals? What are you doing ! What I should have done long ago. What do you think? I don't know how much torture you suffered? I ignored everything she did' but she thought I was meek. But things have crossed limit now. I'll skin her alive! Beat me if you like. But please forgive her. No dear' she will seek your pardon today. Come on' go ahead ! Please forgive me. I have troubled you all' troubled my children. Now' in your happiness lies mine. Yes. ''O my moonlight' rejoice! ''
