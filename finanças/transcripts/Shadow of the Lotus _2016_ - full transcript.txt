The cocaine has been delivered from the labs, and both shipments are being packed together as you requested. Good, keep it that way. Where are we at in terms of progress? First shipment's on the truck, second shipment should be ready in three hours. That's a quarter-ton more. Make sure there's protection. I don't want any more problems. We've got ten men from the warehouse ready to accompany us with the shipment. Double it. I won't underestimate the Black Lotus. We're all setup. Just waiting for any kind of communication now. The bug's in place? In place but not picking up much other than a couple of forklifts. We're gonna need more than that if we want to hear anything. I'm in. Copy that. You scared me for a second there. I thought I lost you. And what would you do without me? How are things looking down there? You tell me... You're not getting any of this? There's a lot of interference with her video signal. I'll see what I can do. We don't have visual yet, Sarah, give us a minute. Any sign of our target? Not yet. But this is definitely a Red Dragon compound. What makes you say that? Check it. No, you do it. It's good. All right, let's go. Is your man reliable, Fong? Are you sure Woo's gonna be here tonight? Yep. Trust me on this one, boss. Jade, I think we have something. I think we have something. Yeah? It's them. Give me that. It's Woo, where's the meeting place? Don't screw up this time, you hear me? Don't worry about us. You just show up. The meeting place is at Hathcock pier, 3am. That gives you four hours to get all this product there. The meeting place is at Hathcock pier, 3am... Sarah, we got it! Pull back and rendezvous with us at Hathcock pier, one hour. I'm gonna hang back and see where Woo goes. Negative, he's not the target. The money is. Black Lotus orders, Sarah, not mine. Besides, I need you watching my back down there. Like always? Of course. And Sarah... Be careful tonight. You know I won't always be there to watch over you. I'll try not to fall and break a nail. I'll see you after. It's payday, boys and girls. I'm in position, boys and girls. Copy that. Take up recon, let me know if you spot anything. Sarah, are you with us? In position at the far end of the pier. If this goes down, Jade will cover us from the rooftops... We'll sandwich them onto the pier and meet up in the middle. Got it. Any activity on the dock? Not yet. Fong, are you there? What's up boss? Clear out the parking lot, and keep it quiet. You got it, bossman. Can I ask you for a favor before I head out? I think I made like a wrong turn on Main street or something like that. I could really use some help if you've got a minute. That's it, that's it, step right up. Don't be shy. Thank you so much for your help, bless your heart. I'm so lost. See I was heading over to... I said you must leave now. Absolutely chief, absolutely. You're so handsome up close. I've got this map right here. Just need you to take a look, show me where I'm going. I'm so lost. What the hell is this? This is not a map! You cannot be... It's okay chief. I think I figured it out. The Triads just stepped onto the dock, and one of them's carrying a briefcase. That's our target. I've got a clean shot. I'm gonna take him. Not yet. Wait until they're all in position and we know what we're dealing with. Whatever... Fong, come to the other side of the parking lot. I've got us a new ride. On my way, boss. Gentlemen, welcome to the United States. I trust your trip wasn't too uncomfortable? Well how does it feel for you and your men to see the West again after all these years? It's like staring into a backed up toilet. We didn't come here for chit chat. Show us your product and we'll show you the payment. The rest of it is in the truck in the parking lot, ready for transfer. Where is the money? Safe. I want to see it. And we want to see the rest of your product. 86, check in. 86, check in now. Go for 86. Bring the product and start loading into the boat right away. Coming to you now, boss. It's on its way. Just wait a few minutes. You have five. Hey! This is a restricted area. Are you lost or something? Where are your guys? Do we do business or not? Go find out what's going on. Make it fast. Sir. Problems, Mr. Cocaine? There's no problem. Just take it easy. Fuck this... Heads up assholes. Maybe we should go back onto our boat and do business with people less incompetent. Maybe you and your rice-heads can calm the... We have contact! What the hell was that? Someone spotted me, I had no choice! Pin them down! I'm on my way! Take the man with the case! I don't have a shot! I've got him. Shit! Fuck you! We're all clear, Jade. Get down here. Nice job, Sarah. We couldn't have done this without you. Don't mention it. Not bad for your last run. Hopefully I didn't drag you out here for nothing. Bearer bonds. One million a piece. How many? Fifty million, just like Woo said. Try not to spend it in one place. This money isn't going back to our Dai-Io's. It's for us. With this, we can finally make our move to real power. I want you with us. I can't. I'm sorry. Wait, Sarah... Don't do this. You don't need me anymore. Like you said, you have what you need. And I know you'll make a good leader. Magnanimous to the end. I guess this is goodbye then. For now. Wait. Take this with you. No, it's okay. Go on, take it. I don't need it. It's okay. Sarah, just take it. Buy your uncle a new summer home somewhere if not for yourself. Take care of yourself. You know I will. You just don't get it, do you? I warned your uncle what I'd do to him if he turned you against me. Apparently he didn't listen. It was my choice. It doesn't matter, Sarah. You made the wrong one. You both did. If you touch him... You'll what? Kill me? You're welcome to try, Sarah. So long. Get rid of her. Happy trails, sweetheart. Okay here's the deal. The Dragons will have at least two men outside checking everyone who enters the building. You're gonna have to lose your piece. They won't frisk me. Trust me, you'll be the first one they frisk. I'm not moving in on the Black Lotus without protection, John. You know me better than that. Look, I can't help you now that I'm in with these people, Claire. If they find your gun, you're on your own. I can't break cover to help you. I can handle myself. Private meeting tonight. You'll have to leave. I'm here for the negotiations. I'm with the Dragons. Wait a minute, man. It's okay. I've seen this one before. Let him pass. All right. I have to frisk you before you can enter. I understand. You too. I'll handle this one. Step aside, Romeo. Raise your hands for me, little darlin'. Okay, they're clean. Let them enter. Call me sometime. I'm impressed. With what? The fact that I was able to get my gun past that asshole... or that I didn't shoot him? Both actually. Like you said, John. This is serious, I like to come prepared. What the hell are you doing? It doesn't help either of us if I'm stuck in the meeting room with you. I'll get off here and see what I can find. Wait. Claire. Yeah? Watch your six, all right? Will do, partner. Gentlemen, thank you for coming. My colleagues tell me that your boss is tied up with business in the East. I hope this doesn't mean that we'll have to postpone this meeting any further. His affairs in China keep him overdue. My apologies. So he put you in charge in his absence, I take it. Let's just say that 'we' represent the Black Lotus and its best interests, even if it conflicts with the current leadership. Of course. You know, you should really quit. That shit'll kill you. Yeah but, who wants to live forever? So what did you think of that gwai po? Never had white meat before. Should give it a try sometime. You've never had any kind of meat, buddy. Fuck you, guys. Well... Hello beautiful. The boss send you down here to give us some lovin'? I'm here for the Lotus. Sure you are. I can tell you're already expensive. Tell you what. You let me have first round, then you get to take care of my boys. How does that sound? Maybe you didn't hear me correctly, sweetheart. I'm gonna ask you one more time. Shit! Shit! John, you made it! Come on! Hold it! Turn around, put your hands on your head and approach me slowly! I'm not doing anything until you tell me what the fuck is going on here! I'm a cop, Woo, and you're under arrest! Shit! Give it up, Woo! There's nowhere left to go! I'm not going anywhere, John. Yes? Boss, it's me. What is it, Trung? You told me to call you if anything strange happened. It looks like something really big just went down over here in Red Dragon territory. There's bodies and cops everywhere. A police raid? It couldn't be. They just showed up. I've spotted at least ten bodies, all Triads. And boss, two of them are our men. Lee and Chen. How did you know? They planned on selling me out to the Red Dragon while I was here in Hong Kong... But they didn't think I knew about it. Do you want me to contact Fong about this, boss? Don't do anything until I get there, Trung. I'm flying home tomorrow. Prepare for my arrival. What are you hiding? Hold on, let me check in. Central, come in. Hello, come in? Hey Phil, stop stuffing your face and pick up the radio before I come up there and kick your ass! This is Central. All clear, no activity. All right. Take another sweep of the west corridor. And put the food away! 10-4. Fat bastard. Shit. What? Something's there. I thought I saw something... Come on, come on... I wouldn't do that. You do have a habit of showing up at the wrong place at the wrong time. Get up. Gimme the disk. What disk? Yeah, yeah, all right! Shit, fuck... Every guard in the building will hear you if you fire. Last chance. What the fuck? Care to try bargaining now? Don't make me kill you. Kill me, and you walk out of here with nothing. Give me the disk or we're both dead. The disk is encrypted. Only I know how to access it. You're lying. Look, we're both after the same thing here. Now you can either kill me, and take your chances alone... or you can help me get out of here and we can both have what's on the disk. Please... Come on. Forget the elevator, there's no time! Why? It's already here. Look. That's why! Listen! Next time you shoot that close to my head, I'll shoot you and leave you here. We can't stay here! Head for the stairwell! Now! Come on! We need to find a vehicle! I parked my car a few blocks away. Next time, park closer! Fuck you! Wait! Cover me! You'd better know what you're doing! Got it! I'm driving! Where's my helmet? Fuck you. Are you all right? I'm okay. They just barely got my arm. I'm sure you'll be fine. Why did you help me? Like you said, we both need the information on that disk. Is that all? You could've just killed me and taken it. I could have. The Triads, are you working for them? I'm not working for them. Well what then? Let's just say I've got a score to settle with the Black Lotus. Just the Lotus? Because you didn't think twice about blowing away those men from the Red Dragon back there. They were in my way. My name's Claire, by the way. What's yours? We can read what's on this disk, on my computer back at my apartment. The both of us. Or I could just shoot you and leave you here, if that's what you prefer. Really? But, then I'd have a hard time getting this disk back to my apartment without bleeding to death. Fair enough. You know I still haven't got your name. My name is Sarah. This is where you live? Yep. It's nothing special but it's home. We can read the disk on my laptop. How's your arm? I almost forgot. Not exactly a field dressing, but... There. Thanks. You saved my life back there tonight. You handled yourself fine. There's a lot of information on this disk. It's gonna take me a while to sift through it all. Find out all you can. I'll be downstairs. What for? I need to cool off. This is a beautiful place, uncle. It warms my soul and fills my heart with a sense of peace. Is there so little peace in your life, my child? Less than most. You wish to leave the people you work for? I'm afraid of what will happen if I do. We mustn't be afraid of the choices that we face in life, Sarah. You can only do what you believe is right, and others will respond in kind. I'm not afraid for myself, uncle. I'm afraid for you. Don't be afraid. Death is merely a part of life. And is a step we all must take, in time... What's important is how you choose to 'live', my child. And that you know, I love you. I love you too, uncle... Thank you for always being here for me. I've finished looking over the disk. Find anything? The negotiations at the tower were intended to setup a major trade deal between the Red Dragon and the Black Lotus. Weapons, drugs, basically anything you can think of that's illegal. It doesn't say where the first deal is supposed to go down, but it should be soon. Did it say who would be there from the Black Lotus? The only names that I pulled up from the file were from the Red Dragon. Most of them were from the negotiations and are dead now, thanks to you. That leaves only one name on this list that was never accounted for among the bodies that night. Who? Gensho Woo. The head of Biotech. If we could find him before the meeting and tail him there, we could take down the Black Lotus during the deal. Assuming the deal's even still on. It's the best lead we have right now and that's good enough for me. If he's still alive, he'll be in hiding, most likely in Red Dragon territory. Will you help me? As long as you keep up. I brought along some special equipment I borrowed just before I got suspended. I've got two pairs of headsets that we can communicate with. They'll come in handy if we have to split up. And I also have this... It's a portable GPS tracking device. If we can get this onto Woo, we'll be able to track him by using a small digital interface which I've linked to the signal. He'll lead us right to the Black Lotus. Impressive? I'm blown away. The headsets should be fine for up to 500 yards. If we split up farther than that, we'll lose the signal. It'll do. The streets look busy today. Do you think we'll be able to find him in this crowd? Let's split up and look. Hold onto the tracer. If you see anything, be ready. Got it. Watch your six. Right. Sarah, are you there? What is it? No luck finding our target so far. How are things on your end? The same. I'm gonna cut across the street and see if I can get any info from these vendors. I'll contact you if I find anything. Okay. Would you like to buy this? Sorry, not today. I'm looking for a man - Gensho Woo. Do you know where I can find him? Woo? I don't know any Woo. Are you sure you don't want to buy anything? Maybe next time, thanks. Claire, I think we may have something here. What's up? A man named Fong just pulled up across the street. He's from the Black Lotus. The Black Lotus. Are you sure? He just walked into a restaurant with some of his men. I'm going after them. Wait, you can't move in yet. If we lose them now we may never get another chance at this. I'm going in. What are you gonna try to do? Fong, you're late. Traffic, what can I say? Sit down. So what do you know about the negotiations, and the shooter who killed my men last night? Only what I read in the papers. Then you know nothing! There was a woman. One woman! And she was after me, Fong. Take a look at these. These photos were taken by the security cameras at my company last night. She's after me, Fong. I know it. She wants to kill me. Who's this? You tell me. They broke into my company last night. You let them go then. Dammit, you fool, this isn't a joke! I just killed a man two nights ago! Congratulations. Welcome to the club. I'm not a killer. I'm a business man. I agreed to sit down with your people to end this petty conflict. And now, I fear for my life. I wanna know what your boss is doing to fix this situation from becoming any more messed up than it already is. We are looking into the matter. I came here to assure you that the Black Lotus had nothing to do with the attacks on you, or your businesses... and that everything is still on schedule as planned. You know, you should order something. The food here is excellent. I'll pass. Yes. Steamed whole cod, bite-sized meatballs, but keep the sauce light… Shark fin soup, an order of mixed vegetables, and some warm wine. Fuck me... Drop it, Fong. Tell your men to cool it, or I'm gonna show you what you're made of all over this table. Do it. You're dead. Not quite. Where's your boss? Please don't hurt me… get him… I have lots of money… Tell me now. Fuck you. You're gonna kill me anyways. Very perceptive. I always knew I'd get it in Chinatown. You chose the wrong friends. And this time it'll cost me, right? Just like it cost your uncle? Fuck this. Gotcha. You should've kept running. Don't move! What? You think I'm fucking scared of you? Where is he? Who? Your uncle? Don't worry, he's not very far. We actually tossed him right in there. Probably a few miles upstream. What's left of him, anyways. You know what though? All that time, I kept imagining it was you… when I cut him. I'm done playing with you. Aww, come on! You don't want to take the easy way out, do you? You know I'm not good enough for a bullet. Sarah, I know you want a real piece of me. This is your chance. Yeah! That's what I'm talking about! That's the spirit! A fair fight! Hand to hand! Man to bitch! On second thought... Fuck you, bitch! Fuck, you're so gullible! No wonder you didn't see it coming that night. You're fucking kidding me. Don't start what you can't finish. Bitch! Are you all right? Was that the leader of the Black...? No Claire. Well then who was it? Let's go. The police will be here soon. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have snuck up on you like that. It's okay. What is it? Woo's back at Biotech. The signal's pretty weak but it's still responding. Could the tracer have fallen off him somehow? The signal's still moving from inside the building. It's still in his pocket, as far as I can tell. Keep watching, but try to get some rest if you can. Got it. Yeah? Thanks for saving my life back there today. I guess we're even. It was nothing. I'll always have your back, Sarah. That's what partners are for. Right. Shit… Freeze! Drop the shit! Now! Turn around! Do it! Who are you? Who sent you? Don't move. Nice hit, man. What do you think we should do with her? I say we take her out. Don't do anything to her. Take her with us. I want some insurance in case her little friend is still out there somewhere. Did you think I wouldn't notice this ridiculous thing in my pocket? Let's go! Hi there, big guy. Where's Fong? I was told I'd be meeting with him for this, and your boss. Fong sends his regards. He wanted to make it but he left most of his brain matter on the pavement, this afternoon. You know how it is. So he's dead then. You can't even take care of one of your own renegade members. Maybe we should postpone this meeting until you and your boss can get your shit together and kill this bitch! Well you seem in one piece, at least. Lucky for me, I got the jump on her. I could've killed her myself but… she ran off like a coward. Really? But seriously though, how is that bump on your head? Been hitting the bottle a little bit too hard lately? Everybody calm the fuck down! We wouldn't want our meeting to end early, now would we? What is that? This right here is a basic remote control detonator. And it so happens to be linked to what my friend Douglas has in his hands. Douglas, come over here. Now, if I let go of this trigger, Douglas here is going to have a very bad day. But as you can tell from how much Semtex is in this case, so would pretty much all of us. And we wouldn't want that, now would we, Dougie? No, we wouldn't want that. So all you Dragon boys, put your weapons down now! If you let go of that trigger, you'll also kill yourself and your own men. I don't think you're that insane. Have you 'met' me, Mr. Woo? Your boss isn't stupid enough to make a move like this, is he? That's why he isn't here. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if you're acting on your own, you little psycho bitch! A message from our esteemed leader. Listen carefully. Hello Woo. I'm sure by now you're on your knees begging for your life again… Shit! The Red Dragon is a relic, Woo. A relic of an old and dying age. A business man like yourself must appreciate that when an asset's value is finally depreciated, it's time to get rid of it. Well, old friend... It's your time. This concludes our business relationship, Mr. Woo. Good night, and good luck. What should I do with the Semtex, mistress? Put it in the car, Dougie. I don't care. Now all you Dragons, listen up! If you don't wanna end up like this turd burglar here, I suggest you go back into your cars and get the hell out of here. We own this town now! Then why wait? Why don't you just kill me now? We just needed to take care of the business side of things, Mr. Woo. Boss' orders. And now, without further ado… let's move on to the pleasure. My god! Why can't you just die? You can't kill me, little man. I'm immortal! You were never cut out for this whole gangster thing! Come back here, motherfucker! I'm not finished with you! Wrong car, asshole. Not this time, you boney little skank. Start that car, and let's get the fuck out of here! This isn't one of ours. It's okay, the keys are in the ignition. They're what? They're already in the ignition, let's go! No, there's nothing, now come on! Pop the trunk. What the hell are you doing? When I say 'pop the trunk', you POP the fucking trunk! Well, well, well, what do we have here? Well sleep tight, sweetheart. I'll take good care of you. Hello, sweetheart. Feeling any better? Can I get you anything for that bruise of yours? How about that one? Are you sure? Not so pretty anymore, are you? Fuck you. Just kill me and get it over with. Aww, and where's the fun in that? You'd be surprised at how rarely I get to sit and chat with someone around here. You know, girl-talk. And I bet you've got a lot on your little mind right now. Don't you? Isn't it refreshing to have friends when we need to go vent some of our insecurities? Well, do you have something to tell me, friend? Yeah, I do. And, what is it, sweetheart? Your breath smells like you wipe your ass with your teeth. I could do this all night... but it's been a long day, and I lost a lot of blood. Not nearly enough. What's this? I asked you a question! You know, sweetheart, you're not being very nice to me. I think that you don't appreciate the seriousness of your situation. That's it. And I wonder… how can we fix that? I know! You're right, sweetheart, I've been bad. I'm sorry. I just needed to let off a little steam, you know. It's not easy being the queen bitch of the world. And since you've been such an attentive guest tonight, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna let you off easy. Seriously. Consider this our parting gift to each other. Freeze! I wasn't gonna kill you. I swear. I was just gonna shoot you in the face. And if you wanna get technical, it would've been the bullet that killed you. Not me. Oops. Having a bit of trouble aiming today, are we? That was close. What's wrong? I'm right in front of you. In fact, I'm all around you, sweetheart. Marco… Polo… How's that hand of yours? Does it still hurt? You should really get that looked at, by the way. It might get infected. You're way more fun than Sarah ever was, sweetheart. I could never get a rise out of her. Always so prim and proper. Not much fun at all. Kind of pathetic, really. But you… You don't even see it coming. Shit… Bitch. Where is she? Hello, Sarah. It's been a long time. Turn around, you coward! Or what? You'll shoot me in the back? Never stopped you. True. But aren't you the one who always endeavored not to be like me? Fitting that after all this time… it's exactly what you've become. I'm nothing like you! Actually, I should be thanking you. For singlehandedly taking out the Red Dragon and anyone else who could've stood in my way. If there's one thing I've learned about you, Sarah… You never did know when to quit. Where's Claire? First uncle, and now this cop. You've always had a very misplaced sense of loyalty, Sarah. And this... This is what I get for all the years I've taken care of you? Come on, Sarah… Is that any way to treat your big brother? Think about it! Where was your precious uncle when we were alone in the orphanage? Where was he when I was hand feeding you from the scraps I found on the streets? He tried to protect me from you. No! I protected you! I was the one there for you when no one else was! You told me no one wanted me. I was just a little kid. I could take the hunger, the beatings, the years of hardship… But you knew the only thing I ever wanted. I would've given anything to have a real family. I looked up to you. I trusted you! You killed uncle, and you tried to kill me. You picked him over me. You betrayed me first. I'm sorry. You are just as weak as your pathetic uncle! To think of all these years I've wasted on you! I'll give you something to cry about, little girl. Just like old times, Sarah? How does it feel to fire a gun at a family member? You tell me! Is that the best you've got? I knew that cop friend of yours softened you up! Where is she? Aww, come on, Sarah! This isn't a real fight! Remember how we used to practice? What do you say we try it for real this one time? Point blank only. All right. Good girl. I knew you wouldn't disappoint me. You may be my sister, but you were never my equal, Sarah. Shit. You can't kill me. Just like Sarah couldn't. Did you really think I wouldn't come prepared? If there's one thing I've learned over the years, it's you can't count on anyone except yourself. It really didn't have to end like this, you know. Dying for someone you know nothing about. If Sarah had any sense, she'd have killed you too when you first met. Fuck you. Me? I don't leave anything to chance. Good advice. Are you all right? I've felt better. Here, let me take a look. You've been shot up pretty bad. It's not the first time. These might help. Sarah… I don't know what to say… Does this mean you came to rescue me? Something like that. I guess that makes us even again. Did you get your man? Yeah, that's him. Who was he? No one. So it's really over then. Yep, finished. It's really beautiful. The city, I mean. Yes it is God, I could use a hot shower. Maybe a little morphine too, while we're at it. I guess I wouldn't mind a change of clothes, myself. I'll have to take you shopping sometime. It'll be fun. Sure. Well, not bad for a failed cop and a failed gangster. Your partner would be proud of you, Claire. So would your uncle. All right, let's go home. Just in case.
