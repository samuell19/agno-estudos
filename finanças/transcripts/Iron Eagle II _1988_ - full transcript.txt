Falcon 5-2-niner, proceed to checkpoint, over. That's a big rog, control. Will proceed as instructed. Hey, Cobra! We've got five minutes to checkpoint. You up for it? I'm waiting on you, Thumper. Let's put it at 9.5. These are F16-C's, Coop. The texts say their breakpoint's at ten-and-a-half G's. And I hear they're looking for somebody to prove it. Oh, yeah? I think they just found their guys. You got something to play, Thumper? I got something that'll blow the roofs off in Anchorage. Let's do it. ♪ The new weapon from the sky ♪ Chasing the angels ♪ Hear those voices That's 9.5, Thumper. Beat it or bail. I'm going for 10. If I miss, change my underwear before you bury me. Ha-ha! Whoo! I've been to 10! No way. If I'm lying, I'm dying. You want to call it quits? Falcon 5-2-9, do you read? You're in Soviet airspace. Please respond. Damn it. Control, this is Falcon 5-2-9. We strayed off course due to-- due to INS malfunctions. We'll proceed back. Proceed nowhere. Now hold your position. You've got company. Damn it! Cobra, you spot him? I got him. I got him. MiG 29s. Two of 'em. Get ready to split! Cobra, Thumper, make no aggressive moves. Their fighters are instructed to escort you back to American airspace. I don't like this. Don't rattle, Thumper. Stay on course. We're one minute from Alaskan airspace. They're moving in. We gotta break out of here. Control, this is Thumper. They're squeezing us. Request permission-- Negative, Thumper. Do not break formation. No incident will be tolerated. They got lock! They got lock on me! They're just fooling with us. Stay in formation. Shit! There's two more. We're dead meat. I'm breaking out. They're firing, Thumper. Bank right. I'm left. Shit. I'm on MiG-1.Get him. Come on, baby. Get in there. Shit! That's one. Thumper, talk to me. Where are you? What's your position? I got tone. I'm going for the shot. Shit, Cobra, I missed! Cooper, they're doubling me! Thumper, get out of there. I'm coming to you. I'm out of position, but I'm closing. Shit! I'm in trouble! I've lost rudder control. Step on it, Cobra. I can't shake him. Come on! Got it! Where are you? What's your position? He got lock on me! What's your position? Keep your head, I'll find him. Cobra! God! Mr. Secretary, now that we've just about run out of time, I'd like to ask you about a story that's circulating around Washington-- That one of our planes was shot down... over the Bering Straits by a Russian MiG. I can deny categorically any Soviet involvement in the loss of that aircraft. What we had was a fuel systems malfunction that regrettably led to the death of one of our pilots. Thank you for being our guest on On the Line. It's been my pleasure. Mr. Secretary. Hank, what are you doing here? Have we got a problem? How in the hell can you ask us to do this? Especially in light of what you know really happened. Get us someplace where we can talk. Come on, general, let's go. You know damn well we couldn't go public on an incident like this! The pilots on both sides were way out of line. If this leaked, what they've done could undermine everything we've been working for. That's precisely what makes this type of operation more important than ever. We're trying to nurture a very fragile detente here. A nuclear warhead has just been tested in their desert. And you want us to go in like this? We don't have time for some asinine plan thought up on Capitol Hill. Their missiles will be launch-capable in three weeks. This asinine plan, as you choose to call it, just happens to have the support of both leaders involved. Hell, both countries are equally threatened! From where I stand, I don't see any alternative. The alternative was submitted to your office by the joint chiefs.Yes, goddamn it. That's precisely the kind of preemptive unilateral tactic this administration's trying to avoid. Hank, the choice of the executive branch is simply not open to further discussion. The operational goals are in the file. You look after the details and pick the team. We'll have our representatives on standby. How lucky for us. Make it work, Hank. I'm counting on you. Welcome to Fowler, general. The base is ready for inspection and proud of it, sir. Inspection is complete. Where can I find Sinclair? Sinclair? Yes. Colonel? Been a long time, colonel. Done one hell of a job keeping these memories alive out here. Sometimes I have to remember myself that it's a museum. I've made the most of the duty, sir, in light of the situation. I think it's time we put that little fiasco behind us. I've come to pull you out of the reserves and restore you to temporary active duty with a raise in rank. You've been chosen to command a highly classified operation with specially selected personnel. That's all in the file. A few years ago you flew in and you kicked some hard-core enemy butt. Techniques put you in hot water, not me. But you got the job done. We got another one like it, only bigger. So I'm offering you a star for your uniform and some action for your dignity. We got you some good men, a little rough around the edges. But then again, that's what you're like, am I right? Good luck, general. Carry on. Yes, sir. Mind if I ask you a stupid question, sergeant? Wouldn't expect much else from a flyboy. Where the hell are we? Can't answer that. But I can tell you one thing. It sure as hell ain't Kansas, Toto. Got any idea what we're doing here? I'm gonna be driving, you're gonna be riding. This place got a name, sergeant? That's "need to know," flyboy. Well, I need to know. Hey, what the hell are you doing? Israel? What did they do, trade me? Hi, hi, hi. Shalom. Uh... I'm with you guys. I...I fly. I fly jets. You can put the guns down. I'm one of you guys. I'm not one of you guys, I'm a foreigner, but-- Okay, flyboy, time to get your wings clipped. Oh, yeah? I'll handle this, sergeant. Sightseeing, captain? No, sir. I was trying to find out-- You'll find out all you need to know from me! Now get your butt in this jeep. Yes, sir. Your file isn't exactly a character testimonial, Cooper. What's the matter with you? You got a digestive problem? Digestive problem, sir?Yeah. Seems to me orders are a little hard for you to swallow. And what happened in Anchorage? You booked out of there pretty fast. I just couldn't get used to the cold. Yeah, or maybe it was the heat. That it? Look, Cooper, I don't know what it is that makes you migrate from base to base. But you're not the kind of man I'm used to having in my unit. They why did you pick me, general? I didn't pick you. Somebody in Washington stuck me with you. Here's your barracks. There's gonna be a briefing in the morning. The rest of your men are already in there. Get to know 'em. Your life's gonna depend on 'em. It's the wrong way. What? What? Counterclockwise. Hey, shut the hell up! Want me to help you?You wanna do it? Yes, I do wanna come up and help you! What in God's name is going on here? Attention! You have an explanation for this, Major Bush? Sergeant Downs was standing on top of his bunk waving his cigar when he mistakenly set off the sprinkler system, sir. What was Sergeant Downs doing on top of the bunk in the first place? I was agitated, sir. That's putting it mildly. I was agitated because one of your pilots tried to swap one of his raggedy-ass blankets for mine. Yes, sir. I freely admit it, and I take full responsibility, but I was deprived as a child. Deprived? You were "deprooved." That's enough! Yes, sir. I want this place dried up immediately. Do you understand that? Yes, sir. Counterclockwise. Why don't you just cut it off? Come on, laugh! Don't you dare move, major! Anybody want an umbrella? You're pretty good at this. They transfer you here from Air Force intelligence, sergeant? Yeah, that's right. Two days ago. Just in the nick of time, because I was about to take this fall, so to speak, for running a numbers game on the computers. You play the numbers, Cooper? No. No? Don't worry about it. I'll show you how sometime. Thanks. Sure. You seen much combat, sir? Mock engagements. Red flag. Why do you ask? Trying to figure out how we all got picked. How about you? Flight leader over Libya in '86. I personally hosed down two MiGs. What about you, hotshot? I don't remember seeing your face at the academy. Nobody was wearing it. How about that? You weren't even there, and they got you flying 16s. I can hold my own. Where? At night in your bunk? Just kidding. Man, this is a sad-sack bunch they stuck me with. Maybe Downs knows what up. Downs? What's an old Army ranger like you do for a living? I blow up things. Actually people. Bend over, captain, I'll give you a demonstration. Captain. Captain? I think you better take this next bunk up. The general wants us to leave every other one free for the team coming in. What team? When is someone gonna tell me what's going on? We're one half of a joint operation. Who's the other half? The Israelis? Your guess is as good as mine. It's the Israelis, coming back from maneuvers or something. No way. They're twin turbines, and they're big. So who the hell are they? I don't believe it. They're goddamn soviet MiGs! Get the hell out of here! What the hell happened to the goddamn alarm? Shit! You didn't sound the alarm, you asshole! We're under attack! Shit! We're under attack! Hold it! What the hell do you think you're doing? Those are goddamn MiGs, general. Why can't those fools in the tower see that? Those fools in the tower know exactly what they're doing, which is more than I can say for you bunch of idiots! That is the other half of your team, gentlemen. That's right. The pride of Mother Russia. Get back in those barracks and get ready for a briefing now! Russia? Shit! Yes! All right, gentlemen, proper military decorum will be adhered to at all times. No aggressive confrontation will be tolerated. Is that clear? Yes, sir. I can't hear you! Yes, sir! That's better. On your feet. I said stand, and I meant it. I've been serving my country for 19 years. I shed blood for it. I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand up and salute a bunch of communist bastards. Attention! Attention! Attention! Colonel Vardovsky of the Soviet Army at your service, general. Welcome, sir. However, I am Major Bush of the United States Air Force. The general is right behind you, colonel. Brigadier General Charles Sinclair, United States Air Force. Excuse my mistake, general. You can understand it will take a while for us to get used to the various colors of your high-ranking insignias. In Russia, things are simpler. So I'm told, colonel. I have heard that your military does lean somewhat heavily towards the lighter shades. Sit. Now, Cooper. I'm ready for any bullshit they wanna start. Right. Oh, yes. Number one is this! This? This is a pathetic symbol of a youthful propensity towards violence. Asshole! What are you looking at, asshole? Sorry we're late, general. Sorry, sorry, everybody. My name is Edward Strappman. I'm with the state department. To my right is my distinguished Russian colleague Sergei Demitriev, under secretary of the Soviet Central Committee. Before Mr. Strappman continues, let me express our general secretary's wishes that this mission... be a resounding success. Thank you, Mr. Demitriev. Our president shares these sentiments. Okay, let's go. Our mutual intelligence agencies have uncovered a nuclear weapons compound embedded inside the Kavior Gorge in Sector 10, Alpha Bravo. The compound houses concrete silos equipped to launch missiles capable of reaching densely populated targets on both Russian and American soil. Their warheads will be nuclear-capable within two weeks. I don't have to tell you that their regime is highly unstable and extremely fearful of any moves our countries make towards detente. So this compound is-- Well, it's an offensive threat that neither side can live with. And you've been mobilized to eliminate it. You see... you people have a chance to prove something: that the Soviets and the Americans can work together as one. You got a problem over there? Yes. They gave us some broken blankets. Broken blankets, huh? That's a doggone shame. I think I might be able to help you out. You got any American dinero? Dinero? Yeah, you know, like cash. Moola. Greenbacks. I have only rubles. Give us our blankets. Red light there, comrade. This ain't Russia. Everything's got a price. Let them have them, Graves. I don't know. I don't think I like his attitude. You have a problem with these accommodations? No, sir, I was just explaining to our communist friends about laundry procedures. That's very kind of you. You have one hour to clean up, and then I want everybody out on the tarmac. Don't go away mad, fellas. It's on the house. Thank you. ♪ You came along ♪ I'm on your phone ♪ ♪ For far too long ♪ And now ♪ You trust no one ♪ Baby, it has been done Did you take a good look? Ah, yes, thanks-- I mean, no, no. No, I was-- I was just trying to-- I was trying to place the, uh, uniform. Um, are you attached to Soviet intelligence, or just one of the men in your unit? You have got it all figured out, haven't you? Except there is one thing you have overlooked. What's that? The capacity of the basin behind you. Shit! This mission profile provides a ground assault unit commanded by Colonel Vardovsky, and an aerial strike force commanded by me, with Major Bush as flight leader. Colonel. Ground unit, fall in behind and to my left. Downs, Hickman, Balyonev, Koshkin. Huh? I don't believe it. Ain't no way. She's a pilot. No chance! The vehicles approaching you are Soviet VMP5s. Our most advanced armored assault vehicle. Each unit is equipped with two cannon on rotating turrets, missile launcher and full radar surveillance. Lieutenant Balyonev will familiarize you with their operation. We're already familiar with them. Is that a fact, Hickman? It's a fact. Company makes them first back in the States. Which company is that? Mattel. Mattel? It's a toy company. Here's the main control of the vehicle. And here we have vector controls. Thank you very much. Thank you very much for sharing all this information with us, but we do have a little bit of familiarity with these vehicles. Don't we? Yes. Downs, would you just listen? I was just explaining to Mr. "Baloney" what the situation was. My family is Balyonev. Balyonev. Anyway, you guys stole most of your designs from us. We took everything from you. That's right. That's right, you did. Yeah. We stole everything. Please, please. What is that? Turret control? Yes, but-- These are from your vector coordinates, am I right? No, no. And this... Downs, don't touch that. Directional tilt. No! This unit has two objectives: to provide air cover for the ground unit, and to eliminate the primary target. Today, you'll get use to flying joint formations. Major Bush will provide the designated patterns. Any questions? Do we have a chance to practice mock engagements against the Americans? Oh, no. I'd hate to provide you with any temptation like that. Any other questions? Okay. F16s are designated Alpha, and MiGs Bravo. Get out there and crank up those turbines. Go! Mock engagements! They trained us to target these people, not rub wings with them. I don't know. I wouldn't mind rubbing wings with her. I wonder how she flies. I don't know. A little tight in the turbine and loose in the flaps just like she walks. Any sign of the enemy, Zuyeniko? Shit! Whoo! Coops, she flies a lot different than she walks! Hell of a lot different! Whoo! Alpha and Bravo teams, assume diamond formation. Alpha One, why a pattern so simple? Do your men lack experience? Cut the chatter. Fall into position. Let's make sure the formation's tight. Got me, Graves? Yeah, I got you, pal. Big roger on that one. Alpha Two, you're flying too close. Give 'em room, Cooper. Hey, Coops, she's in your jet wash, man! Are you all right? I will be fine. Let us just get back to base. Son of a bitch. You got a funny way of peeling off. You practice that over the Bering Straits? What are you saying? You and three other MiGs. remember? You were there! Back off! What's going on?Ask him! He rolls right, then peels left after the kill. He is maniac. We are trained in this maneuver. It is nothing. Nothing? Oh, it means everything when your best friend's blown out of the sky! Cooper, back off. Back off! The rest of you are dispersed. Now! Cooper? How long did you fly with him? Who? Doug Masters. He was a friend of mine too. We flew combat together. You're Chappy? I normally don't let anybody call me that and get away with it. Unless it's over a beer. Come on. I pushed too hard. I almost blacked out. Next thing I know... Doug's a fireball... falling from the sky. I knew it had to be something like that. I figured you had crossed into Russian airspace, had an encounter of some sort, and they covered it up. I never did buy that story about a training accident. If you don't mind, general, I'm not much on memories, so... I guess you're not much on Russians either. Well, that won't cut it here, Cooper. I am the last guy that should've pulled this duty. There's not much I can do about the way I feel. Yes, there is. Sit down. I loved Doug Masters just like he was my son. But he's dead and buried. You gotta make your peace with that. I'll try, sir. You gotta do more than try. Much more. Tell me if these guys don't look like a couple of monkeys. Huh, what's happening? What'd he say? He said you look like-- Like what? Ugly monkeys. How many do you want? Give me two. Balyonev, Balyonev, my good friend Balyonev, have I got a deal for you. Get up for a second. We're trying to play a game. This'll take two seconds. He's got a bum hand anyway. Try this shirt on. Yeah. Yeah! You fashion victim. Let me have a look. No, it's-- This is unbelievable. You have got the face of Arnold Schwarzenegger. Um... Conan. Conan! Yeah, you got it, buddy. Balyonev the Barbarian, huh? This shirt used to belong to him. Normally I wouldn't sell it, but you look so good in it. How come tag price is still on? That's not a price tag. That's an American laundry tag. It's written "25." Yeah, that means it's been washed 25 times. The beauty of this material is it looks brand-new. Let's take that tag off. I guess I owe you an apology. It is not necessary. Yeah, it is. I compromised your safety up there. A lot of pilots freeze up when caught in jet wash. Not this one. So I noticed. Anyway I'm sorry. You are the textbook American pilot. Aren't you, Cooper? Do you have one of those macho call signs like "Stud" or "Ace"? Cobra. My call sign's Cobra. Ah! The big-headed snake. It suits you. The valley up ahead is similar to the terrain near Kavior Gorge where target destruction can only be achieved by low-level approach. F16s will run under 400 feet. MiGs will provide high-altitude air cover. Sir, wouldn't it be advisable for me to fly high-altitude observation? Profile is not open to discussion. Now, get down in those canyons. Beginning approach. Alpha Two, are you in position? I'll be in that seat with you if you don't punch your airspeed. What's he doing, Coop? Stopping for a red light? Sir, is there anything wrong? You're flying 200 knots slower than the profile. It's the turbulence. Turbulence? What turbulence? Kick up your speed, major. It'll stabilize. I'm increasing airspeed. I-I'm stable. It's too tight. It's too tight! Sir, you're right about the turbulence. You better pull up. Sir, pull up! Pull up, sir! I can't, I tell you. I can't! Pull out, sir, pull out! Major, the choice is in your hand. Move the goddamn stick! I'm out of it. How come you weren't affected by those wind patterns, Cooper? I guess I was just lucky, sir. Lucky, huh? General. TAC HQ on the line, sir. Dismissed. Let's go. Cooper? Yeah? Listen, thanks a lot. For what? For covering for me. I didn't. Turbulence came up, and we pulled out, simple as that. You know damn well there wasn't any turbulence. It was me. I lost it. I get cramped up in tight places. I don't know why they picked me for this. I guess-- I guess I should've probably told them. Told them what? Sometimes you get a little spooked? We all do, major. Guess that's why God invented adrenaline. Hey, see you later. Come on. It won't fit. What do you mean it won't fit? Start it up. Come on! Move it up the ramp. It won't fit. It's gonna fit gold. It's gonna fit gold. Beauty. what did you call me? I didn't call you nothing. I said it's gonna fit. Pull it up quick. A perfect fit. I told you. Can't you see that will not fit? You screwed up-- What'd you say?Stop it. It won't fit. I told you that! Down, down, down! Uh-oh, dead eye. That's one. That's one. Let's see what you got. Excuse me. Is that for you or your boyfriend? I'm sorry to disappoint you, but it is not so complicated as you think. He merely looked out for me. Anything more than that would be against the rules. Russia's or yours? Both. Why must you always play the cool American, Cooper? Where do I find the pilot who saved your Major Bush this morning? You know, you're in luck? He's having lunch right over there in about two seconds. Why don't you join him? Why not? Magic Johnson? Yeah, let's see it. Magic Johnson. Give the man the money. Give me five. Give me five. Cooper, Zuyeniko, let's get out here. Sir, we're just sitting down to eat. You can eat lunch after you work up an appetite. Come on, let's go. Everybody... You ever played this before? Basketball? Yeah. Never. It's pretty hard, but you'll get the hang of it. You gotta sink the ball. That's the idea. Go ahead, take a shot. I don't believe it. Come on, there's money on it. I don't think so. I think you know exactly what you're doing. Not in this game. In any game. Skyhook. Hey, hey, nice check. Nice defense. Let me handle this. Koshkin. Don't quit on me now. You got potential. Play in the NBA someday. Huh? Come on out here, man. Let me show you how to shoot the ball. Fellas, why don't you lighten up, leave the guy alone? Shoot the ball good? Let's try and get it right this time. Bravo team, split left and climb. Falcons, drop. Target approaches in five minutes. Captain, if our ordinance was armed, we could pick up where we left off at out last encounter. Only your wingman would be different. You lying bastard. It was you. Hey, hey, hey! Save it for the ground, man! Save it for the ground! Alpha Two and Bravo One, get back into position. That's an order. Cooper, get back into formation. Too fast for you, Alpha Two? Come on, you got nothing to be afraid of. Where the hell are you? I am disappointed in you, Cooper. You Americans prove to be a quite easy target. I have you locked, Cooper. Look again, Lebenov. Excellent move, captain. But why do you hide? You're mine now, asshole! Is this the angle? Huh? Is this how you and your buddies took him out? That's it. It's over, pal. You're dead. Next time it'll be for real, comrade. You can count on it. Cooper, Lebenov, get your butts down here! I'm tired of hearing it, Cooper. Whether he was there or not doesn't make a difference! You violated his airspace. Now you take a look at him. Take a-- Look at him! Whether you like it or not, he is on our side! And whether you like it or not, you are not flying this mission alone. Am I getting through to you? Yes, sir. I can't hear you! Yes, sir! Good! Because if I ever have to use those words again, you're not flying nothing! General, I believe the men are all capable soldiers. I just think we've come to an impasse due to, uh, personality problems associated with the tensions of the training. My men are being provoked. This Cooper's behavior is revolting. The rest of his unit is not much better. If you ask me, your men do not even possess the skills necessary to carry off this operation! I'll match one of mine against one of yours anytime. If you want, start with me! Is that a challenge, general? You bet your ass it is! Gentlemen, could we not start World War III? You and fools like you started this shit. Just a minute. You dare to be insubordinate to representative? The general is right, you cheap errand boy for the politburo! Gentlemen, please! Okay? Please. Damn! Okay, look, we'll give the men a day off. They can do some sightseeing. It'll relax the tension. What is that? What did he say? He called you an idiot. Terrific. He called you an idiot! Idiot. Here. Okay, thank you. Cooper? At least give a person a chance to say thank you. I wasn't looking for it. Just what are you looking for, captain? Maybe a place away from the crowd. Do you consider two people a crowd? No. Come on. Graves? You lied to me about the shirt. Come on, them cheap imitations! You got the real McCoy. Don't worry about it. I watch you up there, Zuyeniko. It's in your blood. You're born with it. That MiG takes you... right up to the edge. And you love being there. Just like me. We are more different than I thought, Cooper. I fly for my people, not for myself. To protect them from--From what? Enemies like me? Do I look like the enemy, Zuyeniko? Do I? Zuyeniko! Be right back. You know something, Lebenov? You don't know when you're ahead of the game. Never point a finger at me. You're right. Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, come on, break it up. Break it up. That's enough! That's enough! Hey, Cooper! I've had it with you. You've crossed the final line with me, boy. You're grounded! All right, now what's going on here? Cut it out! I said-- Come back here! Come on, move it. Move it! Quick, move, out. Come on! Come on, everybody back. Come on! I said, get back there, goddamn it! I did all right. I caught him one shot, he went down. Captain, uh, I just want to go on record for saying that I think the general's wrong about this. Well, I didn't give him much choice, did I? Hell, Cooper, you're the best pilot in the unit. You should be flying lead instead of me. I don't have it. Major, you got it all. You got nothing to worry about. If it gets tight up there, just pretend you're all alone in the blue sky. That's what I do. I'll remember that, captain. Good luck, sir. Thanks a lot. Listen, when I get back from maneuvers, I'll have a word with the general. See if maybe I can't get you back on board. He's a pretty tough guy. So am I. Send you a postcard, buddy. There is no dignity for a pilot in being grounded, captain. That is something for sure that I know. You see... a comrade of mine was once great pilot. Now he sits forever in wheelchair. Shells from your F16 have chained him to it. As you have thought, I was there. But my missile did not kill your friend. It was unfortunate day for all of us. Both sides were foolish. For that, I am sorry. Alpha and Bravo teams, training cycle three will now begin. Roger. Alpha Three, follow my lead and drop to 300 feet. Bravo One and Two, fly high cover. Roger, that's a copy. And, major, keep your feet up down there, huh, buddy? I'm beginning approach, captain. Let's take it slow, major. They're not handing out trophies for speed records. What do you want? A word with you, sir. Can't you see I'm busy, captain? Sir, I want back in. I was wrong about Major Bush. I don't think he should be up-- Just when did you give a shit about Bush or anybody else? Those people are out trying to make this thing work! Sir, atmospheric conditions could be better. Follow my lead as instructed. Yes, sir. All right, let's run those canyons. Settle down, sir, settle down. Too tight to make those kind of moves. I'm gonna open it up a little. Ha-ha! All right! Aren't you pushing it a bit? I feel great, captain. There's no room! Climb! Climb, sir! Goddamn it, general! I'm pulling out! ♪ It seems that I have played The game your way too long ♪ ♪ And it seems the game I've Played has made you strong ♪ ♪ When this game is over I won't end up a loser ♪ ♪ And I know that I'll be Walking out again ♪ ♪ Yes, I know that I'll be Walking out again ♪ ♪ Wild ♪ Ooh, yeah ♪ Try ♪ Ooh, yeah Pull up a chair. This is one hell of a mess, isn't it? I know you've done your best, general, but under the circumstances, I'm gonna have to recommend that this operation be canceled. Well, I guess it all started harmless enough. American president, Soviet general secretary, they get together. They figure a small-scale surgical strike against the target will save more lives than the plan we offer them. Hell, I can buy all of that. But then they decide on this joint forces bullshit because they think it'll move us further down the road to detente. That's where I had to part company. You more than anybody, Sinclair, you can see how that road leads to disaster. You set us up, didn't you? What are you saying? You know damn well what I'm saying. You had the deck stacked against us from the get-go. You sent me the biggest bunch of misfits you could find, knowing full well they couldn't cooperate with each other. Much less the Russians. You're out of your mind. Am I? I got proof right here. This is Bush's file. Open it. Listen-- Open it! What the hell am I supposed to be looking for? Something that's not in there. Bush's medical record. I called his former C.O. He told me all about it-- That Bush has acute claustrophobia in tight terrain. That's something you people conveniently left out of his file. He should never have been chosen for this mission! How could you do that? What would you have done, you self-righteous son of a bitch? Put us back in bed with the communists? Somebody's got to do what's right for this country. Yeah. Well, maybe Strappman will be happy to hear about that. Hear about what? That you failed? He knows that. Anything else you tell him, it'll be your word against ours. You think he's gonna believe a washed-up, one-star general been put out to pasture in an Air Force museum? May I be dismissed, sir? Gladly. ♪ Livin' on the edge ♪ ♪ Livin' on the edge ♪ ♪ Livin' on the edge ♪ Mmm! A drink, general. How much of this did you know, colonel? What? I have been relieved of my command, just like you. My God, you don't get it yet, do you? They used you, man. They used me too. Used us for what? To fail, goddamn it! God, isn't it obvious by now? Look at this. Yuri Lebenov, three times reprimanded by the party. Georgi Koshkin, five years disciplinary duty in Siberia! Thousands of innocent lives. What? Didn't they tell you?No. What? Our air command is dispatching a high-altitude bomber to the target with full nuclear payload. Your military is doing the same. The fallout will destroy every village within hundreds of miles of that gorge. Well, I am not in the habit of failing. Those men are due to rotate out of here in the morning. You get them on that ordinance line. Oh-- You do it. You fill them in. You tell them the story. You do it. Did you tell them? Everything. You heard the news.Yes, sir. That suits me just fine. I'm sick and tired of working for a bunch of communists anyway. Hey. Here's your chance. Grab it. Shoot one of those commie bastards. Shoot one of them! Oh, I get it. You don't like to shoot an unarmed man, huh? Koshkin, come here. What's the matter? Don't anybody have the guts to shoot the enemy? Hey, Cooper. Lebenov, come here. Here you go. Come on! Well, come on! Just what I thought. Nobody got the guts! You're losers. Just like they said. They sent you guys here because they knew that you were gonna fail. And you know what? They picked right. But I'm grateful, you know. I'm very grateful, because you taught me something today. You taught me something about courage. It took a lot of courage to come here and train with a bunch of soldiers from the other side when deep down you hated what they stood for. I'm really grateful. It took a lot of courage to hold on to that prejudice when we've worked so hard to cut it out of you. Very grateful, people. But as you fly out of here today, I want you to ask yourself one thing. Where was that courage when you had a chance to stop them from killing thousands of people with no reason to die? Aah. Up until today, I never thought that courage could come and go. When I look into your faces, I know it's gone. Your transports will leave here in an hour. And you'll go home... a bunch of failures and a bunch of losers. General! All right, get ready for briefing. We've got some bombers to beep to our target. This is the bull's-eye you have to hit. Reactor-evaporation ducts. They've been installed horizontal for lower vulnerability. Graves, Cooper, you'll have to send a maverick into each one of these shafts to blow that compound sky-high. Sir, with both of us in the valley, we're gonna be sitting ducks to enemy fighters. That's why the MiGs will be flying high-altitude cover. You've got a bigger problem. Those mountains are protected by surface-to-air missiles that have to be knocked out by the ground unit before you can even fly through them. This bunker houses the computer guidance center which controls the missiles. Charges must be laid at its base, since it cannot be penetrated from the air. Once it is destroyed, the SAM sites will cease to operate and the planes can go in. Our fight is with those who man that compound, and no one else. If we succeed, the casualties should be limited to only them. If we fail, then we'll get a firsthand look at nuclear fallout. And that will be the last look we'll ever take. See you on the runway in 0640. You can rest assured, Marshal Stepanov. We run our ships a lot tighter on this side of the curtain. I don't give a rat's ass what they told you! You tell SAC to put the bombers in the air. And you tell those AWOL fighters and the ground unit to get back immediately, or there'll be hell to pay. And if anybody argues with me about that, bring him right to me! General, general, they're already on their way. At least give them a chance. I'll give them a goddamn court-martial. Then damn it, general, I'll recommend the same for you! I have gone through the files thoroughly and it would be simple to prove how you deliberately-- Deliberately-- Undermined this operation. Is your career worth it? Is your pension worth it, Stillmore? Alpha One, this is control. Proceed as planned with full authorization. Repeat: proceed as planned. You hear that, general? I heard it, captain. Drop to 5,000 feet. Let's go to work. Rock and roll! All systems go, sir. Yeah. So far, so good, sergeant. I told you, sir, we're invisible. Their scopes won't see shit. Welcome to the 21st century. Cooper? Be careful. You guys getting a room or flying a mission here? five minutes to point zebra, sir. Point zebra, what's that? Enemy airspace. The point of no return. Contact Ramsteen. Verify that the bombers have been scrambled and they're on standby. You just can't wait to pull the trigger, can you, general? Your men got a temporary reprieve. They screw up one little bit, those bombers fly. Bravo One, this is flight leader approaching point zebra. Drop to 300 feet on my lead. Roger, Alpha One. Damn it! We've been picked up on radar. Alpha One, Alpha One. We got hostile target block on the transport. Graves, break wide on my lead. Have locate on radar source. Ten degrees southwest. Looks like a SAM unit. It's showtime, Graves. I'm born to burn, buddy. They got one away! We're gonna be hit, sir. Control, this is Alpha One, do you read? Abort the mission, return to base. General, we can't--Goddamn it, I said abort the mission! Colonel, what do we do? Return as instructed. Your orders are clear. They've had it, man. Downs, are you all right? I screwed up my knee a little bit. Can you walk? I'm all right. I can walk. Downs, you're gonna have to blow the hatch now! Bravo leader, do you read? Cooper, report back to base. I'm coming down for a look. Cooper, where the hell are you going? Return to base at once. Our orders are clear. Zuyeniko, return to base as ordered. Control, you got an enemy ground unit approaching fast from the south. You copy? Enemy ground units, 12 miles south. Cooper, how many of you left? Just me and Graves, sir. Bravo team has returned to base. Give us as much air cover as you can, okay? Our pleasure, sir. Cooper? Yes, sir? Thanks for sticking around. Move it. Yes, sir. Call Ramsteen. Tell him to get that bomber in the air. Come on, son, get a move on. We got a dollar waiting on a dime here! What's your plan, Marshal Stepanov? Our bomber is already airborne. Graves, there's too many to pick off. Let's try to split them up on the next pass. Check. Bank around for another run. Graves, four bandits, 3:00. We got a five-ton welcoming committee homing in on us, sir. And the son of a bitch ain't smiling. Holy shit! Get ready to bump heads! I've got visual. They're coming hard! You get the ugly one, I got the pretty one, huh? They're surrounding us. We've got nowhere to run. It's not getting any prettier down there, Graves. It ain't Shangri-la up here! Damn it! Arrivederci. Do you see them?No problem. What the hell are you gonna do? A basic Russian tactic. Separate them into their complement parts. All right, do it. Oh, yeah! Lock and load, baby! Lock and load! Coop, what's your position? 12,000 feet. Two bogies in front. How about you, Graves? I got nasty company of my own. I'm about ready to lose it. Pick up your speed. We gotta bust through. We've been hit. Vardovsky, we can't last long pinned down like this. We will provide you with transportation. Koshkin, arrange a rendezvous with that ATR up ahead. Y'all vacate the vehicle now. It's all yours, general. Haul ass! Come around the other end. Follow our lead, colonel. We ain't gonna need reverse. Come on, slide your butt in there, Charlie Delta. There it is. Speed kills, peaches. Come on, out, out! Coop, one of their fighters just took out a BMB. He's at 2 o'clock. I'm on him. Slow down. We can work this out. You wanna work this out, don't you? Guess not. Hurry up! Get in here! Sit down. You won't be able to set those charges with that bad leg and no air cover. I think I can do it. You get hit with that dynamite, we're all dead. I will go. There is no other choice. All right, all right. I'm gonna go with you. The rest of you, give us some cover.Yes, sir! Get these guys off my ass. I'm almost there. Coming over the top. Coop, I overshot. I'm way out of position. Damn it. They've got lock. I'm dropping in behind you. Zuyeniko. Sweep right. I'm taking the shot. I like Russians that disobey their orders. An unfortunate byproduct of American influence, comrade. Cooper, more fighters approach from the south. If we get out of this thing, I want you to come to the States. I'll show you some stuff that you'd never believe. No way, my friend. I'm told in the States, they shoot communists in the streets. Hell, man, in Detroit, my hometown, they shoot everybody in the streets. Let's do it. Come on, let's go. I've got some special surprise. What have you got? Bomb buffet, man. It's a recipe my daddy cooked up for uninvited guests. Now's the time. Throw it out, man. Throw it out like, uh-- Like some bad borscht. One here, one there. They're not working. The lousy stinking duds! Some family recipe, huh? Don't criticize the cuisine before it's served. Whoo! Yeah! Cooper, I cannot lose him. Coming in behind. Drop low and bank right. Thank you, comrade. There's still more. Where's Zuyeniko? Cooper, I'm going to be hit. Zuyeniko, bank hard! Stay away from that gorge until the SAMs are taken out. Everybody understand that? I don't care what chances they think they've got. You tell them to pull out, because I'm not gonna be responsible when those bombs come falling on them. Eat this! I knew it. The detonator. Go, go, go! General, you guys all right, sir? We can't blow it. We gotta get out of here. No. No way! No way! Damn it! Downs, what's the transmitting frequency? Six to eight megahertz. Why? Excellent, sergeant. The radio, it could set off the charges if you transmit close enough to the bunker. I know. I'm going for it. Wait. You can't run. That's the fastest way of getting hit. You ever try and catch a cab at night in Queens? Let me go! Let me go! Give him cover! Come on, blow. Blow, you bastard! Blow! Mobile one reports the guidance system's been eliminated. They're requesting instructions. I don't care what's been eliminated. As long as those silos are still operational, I don't want the bomber to turn back. How long before it reaches the target? They should be over the target in five minutes, sir. Outstanding. First SAM unit coming up. Let's hope they're not working on backup power. Ten seconds to target. Hey, Coop, one of them just dropped in behind me, man. He's crazy. There's no way he can maneuver. He's about to move up my ass. Check my six, buddy! You're too far up in front. I can't get the angle. He's snaking in tight. I'll try to bounce him off the wall. Gotta watch those right turns, homeboy. Closing in on the target. Pick them out and get the hell out of here. More guns. Get ready to unload. What is this? I thought you made a reservation. Let's bug out! Did you get off a shot? I went wide. I'll get it on round two. You're pulling into the soup. Cooper, we're running out of time. There's three left. Can you hold on? We will make it. Just take out the target. We're gone. I got one maverick left. You got first crack. Don't miss. Start your vacation. This one's on me. Target's coming up. Watch out for those guns. Those guns better be watching out for me. Cooper, I've been hit! Pull up! Pull out of there! I'm breaking up, man. I'm losing it. Graves! Lebenov, graves has been hit. I'm going back down. There is no time. Let me go instead. No way. It's too tight. I have two missiles left. You have one. If you miss-- She's right. Let her go. All right, get down there. I'll cover you. The target's surrounded by high-speed cannons. Stay clear of them. I plan on it, captain. Cooper, get him off me! Move away to clear my shot. You're clear. Target dead ahead. Arm your weapons. Valeri, Yuri, climb! Sir, the bombers have aborted. Our unit has destroyed the target. Come on! Whoo-hoo! Buddy, here I am! "So we stand here, "indebted to the soldiers who have triumphed "on this historic occasion. "It is now incumbent upon each of us "to triumph even in the greater battle that lies ahead. "The battle with the flags that wave above us, "the flags that unify our nations but separate our world. "This battle will not be fought on the fields of war, "but in our own hearts and minds. "And should we emerge victorious, "perhaps we will get beyond those flags to a new one. "One that all of us are willing to fly. "Signed, the general secretary "of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and the president of the United States of America." Congratulations to you all. Dismissed. I owe you an apology, general. And I'd like to offer you an opportunity to keep that star you're wearing. Come work on my staff. This piece of silver on my shoulder doesn't mean anything to me, sir, if I have to serve under you. Dos vedanya, my friend. Dos vedanya. Excuse me, general, could I have a word with you? How would you like...? I have a project that might interest you. I guess there's nothing left but goodbye. Don't say it. I hate that word. It's the hardest word to say and the toughest word to forget. All right then. Dos vedanya, captain. Dos vedanya. Thanks again, sir. Thank you very much. Thank you. All right. Good luck to you, general. Thank you, sir. Aw, come on, Cooper, we're burning jet fuel. I hate people to keep me waiting. Come on! Has anybody ever told you you're a coldhearted soul? You watch your mouth. Besides, you'll see her Tuesday. Come on. What? What's the matter? I'll see her Tuesday? Yeah, you'll see her-- Oh, I didn't tell you. I didn't tell you about it at all, huh? Tell me what? Wait a minute. Hey, Vardovsky? What? You didn't tell them about Tuesday? I forgot. I told everybody but them. What about Tuesday? What Tuesday? Tuesday, we're going to Moscow. You would like to go to Moscow? Who's going? Me and you, all of us! We're gonna have a parade, marches, medals for the draw, stuff like that. Well, anyway, they have this new foreign exchange program with Russian pilots and American pilots. Guess who gets to choose. Vardovsky. You do like Russians, don't you? Some of them.
