Did you know that you can get married here? In this old place? Mm-hmm. It looks a bit haunted. What? No, it doesn't. I actually think it's quite romantic. Romantic? Mm-hmm. What happened to getting married in a church? Churches are for boring people. Hey, you know I'm not boring. Hey, stop. Stop. Don't think you can just ply me with wine and then get what you want. Why not? It usually works. Maybe. But you promised me a massage. And I will, later. Later? That's what you always say, and then you just conveniently forget. But I forgot my oil. Well, I've got some. Of course you have. What was that? What was what? I heard something. It's probably just a fox. No, it was like a growl. Do you think it could be, like, one of them big wild cats? Babe, there are no big wild cats around here. It's probably just a badger. A badger. Yes, a badger. Mike? Mike, please, you're scaring me now. Stop it. Mike! Mike? Mike? Oh, hi, there. You must be Dylan. Yeah, hi. Welcome to Cedar Manor. Thank you. Sorry I'm a bit late. No problem. I was starting to think that the wedding was canceled. No, I just got held up at Heathrow. My flight was delayed. Oh, been anywhere nice? China. Oh. Business or pleasure? Business. I work for an anti-poaching organization. Oh, wow. Well, let me show you around. So I take it you haven't been here before. No. So we cater for weddings of all different sizes. We have extensive grounds and buildings available. So you can see we have the hot tub, sauna, and a pool, and then this gazebo right here, where most people get married. Sounds idea. Well, tell me more about this anti-poaching work. I'm intrigued. It's mainly educational, spreading word about how killing animals is wrong. But there's always some idiots that think a ground up rhino horn will give them a hard-on. That's just silly, isn't it? So are you ever out there in Africa in the thick of it? No. No. I quit that a while back. Oh. My wife, she was targeted by poachers. Since the incident, I took a step back from ranger work. I'm so sorry to hear that. These things happen. I can't imagine. How can anyone get over something like that? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just let it ring. It's my daughter. Babe. I'm coming. I'm coming. Yeah, I'm at the venue. It's great. They're very accommodating. You're going to love it. It's going to be perfect. Very nice. It has a certain charm. A hidden charm. Hmm. Rustic. A tad bougie. Quite elegant. Well, I can see what they're trying to do. God. Mine is the four-poster bed. What? No. That's my room, bitch. Wait. Ooh, very nice. Regal. Boutique? Functional. Oh. And are you going to be consummating your marriage in here in 24 hours time? I'll consummate your ass in a minute. Who are you calling? I'm trying to get a hold of my dad. But there is no bloody reception. Running late again? Yep. You'd think he'd want to be on time for his only daughter's wedding. But... Oh, chill. He's probably stuck in traffic. Yeah. There you are. This ain't too shabby. Hi. All right, dump your bags. We are having a cuppa. Just what the doctor ordered. I could use something stronger. Oh, it's that bad, was it? Just the usual dickheads. Speaking of which, the boys should be right behind you. So come on. Oh, this is nice. The boss is actually making us tea for a change. Oh, less of your cheek. Where's Lisa? She's still trying to get Wi-Fi. Well, this place is pretty cool. Amy, did you say you've been here before? Yeah, I told Lisa about this place, because I'd been here before with my ex. Nice. Did you have a good time? Can't have been that good if he's your ex. Well, we certainly made use of the hot tub. Yes, Amy. Oh, naughty girl. It hasn't been cleaned since. I'm not going in it. Did anyone hear the story about this place? Oh, yeah. No. No. What story? Well, about a year or so ago, two locals went missing. The police found the remains of a party and a torn-up tent down at the end of the grounds, but no bodies. What? No way. If you're You telling me that, I'll never get any sleep. Oh, babe, you're sharing a room with me. You're not getting any sleep anyway. Kinky. Oh, my god, and they never found them? No. And they don't know what happened. So the bodies could still be in the ground somewhere. Shit, or in the cellar. Oh, please don't tell me this place has a cellar. There might be. Oh, great choice of location. There's dead bodies in the cellar. Shh. Dead bodies, where? Oh, we were just discussing a horror film. How'd you get on with the Wi-Fi? It's still not connecting. I mean, I unplugged the router. I reset the whole thing, and nothing is working. Why do you need Wi-Fi? You've got us to entertain you. It's not that. It's just I wanted to live stream the wedding. And I would use my phone, but the reception is crap. And I was promised that there would be Wi-Fi, but nothing seems to be working. And there are people who aren't going to be here, like my grandparents. And I just... they're all expecting a live stream from me. And... Hey, it'll be all right. We'll get it fixed. And if not, it's still being videoed, isn't it? The most important thing is that you and Charlie are getting married tomorrow. That is definitely going to happen. It's your day. It's all about you and Charlie boy... But mostly you. Oh, speak of the devil. Ladies. Hello, wifey. Not quite yet. Is everything all right? Wi-Fi is down. Oh, shit. OK, well, Ben could take a look at it, right? Yeah. Probably, yeah. All right. So shall we get this party started? Yes. Line them up. Oh, careful. Oh, don't worry, it won't stain. She's more worried about you wasting it. Don't worry. There's plenty more where this came from. Wifey? Well, no. No, I am not really drinking. And nor should you be. I don't want you looking all hungover tomorrow. Oh, what are you trying to say? Ben, you are in charge of making sure he doesn't overdo it tonight, please. Yes, ma'am. Are you drinking this then? Absolutely. OK, fill her up. All right, come on. Don't be shy. I'm not being shy. More? More. Yeah? More. More? Chin, chin, Benjamin. Cheers, mate. Ladies and this muppet, I'd like to thank you all for coming to watch me marry this absolute beauty. Here's to an unforgettable wedding. Whoo! Cheers. Cheers! Cheers! Cheers! Yes, with the palm trees. With the cocktails, those really good cocktails. What was that guy's name? The... Umbrellas and... It was like or something. That's my dad. Be right back. OK. And what time do you call this? I'm sorry, babe. You know how it is... Work commitments. So where's my room? Come on, this way. I'm afraid you're stuck with a single room, although I'm not sure you're going to fit in this bed. Don't worry. Reminds me of the ranger ways... Teeny, tiny camp beds. I can't believe my little girl is getting married. I'm not a little girl anymore. I am all grown up, with a job and everything. You call it a job. But we both know, fashion isn't a real job. Fashion isn't a real job. Don't let Vanessa hear you say that. she'd probably slap you. To be honest, I think you'd come off second best. Sounds hot. Oh, Dad. No, I think you two would actually get on really well. I don't know. Maybe it's time to... Lisa. Dad, come on. It's been a long time since... I just want to see you happy again. I know. I know, yes. That reminds me. I've got something for you. I believe the traditional rhyme goes, something old. I got this for your Mum when we were in Africa. And I want you to have it. Thank you. Now, don't get emotional. You go join the party. I'll be down in a second. Oh, you surprised me. Hi, I'm Vanessa. Dylan. We... We met before, didn't we? Yeah, the... The Christmas party at the sky garden. Ah, yes, a little glitzy for my taste. Yes, I remember you saying that you didn't really do fashion. Hmm. Well, you certainly know how to pick out a shirt. That's saying something. Well, it is just a shirt and trousers. I can't really get that wrong. You'd be surprised. Can I get you a drink? Absolutely. I see you two are getting reacquainted. Vanessa's just giving me some fashion tips. Oh, well, I've been trying to do that for years. But it sounds like you're having a lot more success than I ever did, so I'll leave you guys to it. What do you think you're doing? Now kiss! Kiss! I am going to go to bed. Oh, OK, honey. Don't stay up too late. I thought we were going to wait until we were married for you to start nagging me. Yeah, well, I am just practicing. Good night, everyone. Night. Night. Hey, how's it going? How about me and you go walk around the grounds. Oh, I'm pretty quiet tired, so better catch some Zs. Really? Yeah. Oh, maybe tomorrow then. Don't worry about it, mate. She'll be up for it tomorrow. Bridesmaids are always gagging for it on the day, OK? Yeah. So chin up. Go get some rest. I'll clean up here, OK? All right. Hi, there. Hi. So you've been making eyes at me all night. Thought there was something on my face. Could be if you want it to. Oh, yeah? Such as? See, I think it's just better if I show you. My heart is saying, no. But you're dick's saying, yes. Your dick always says, yes. Come on. She's not married yet. True. Who knows? We'll before then. Come on. I'm coming. Tell you what, Georgie, you'd better be leading me out to my death. My god, don't be so ridiculous. What is this place? Georgie, it's a... Don't complain. It's a nice place. Jesus Christ. This all right? We shouldn't be doing this. It's OK. Come on. You wanted this. The torch. Fuck the torch. Yeah, come on. I'm coming. Yeah. Bet Lisa doesn't fuck you like this, eh? I love it when you go hard. It's all right, probably just a fox. What's that? Georgie. Georgie! Georgie, the window! The sill, it's stuck. Come on! Come on! Oh, Georgie. Fuck! Georgie. All set for the big day? Yeah. You? Yeah. Don't fuck this up. Where'd you go, mate? Uh, just for a wander. You didn't see Georgie, did you, on your travels? She wasn't in her room. No. Bet she's playing hard to get. Ben? Yeah? Nothing. Good night. Morning, bridey. Morning. You're getting married today. Stop. It's not normal to have this much energy in the morning. Plant-based diet, I keep telling you. No. No way. I'm not giving up my meat, bacon. Speaking of, can I bring you some breakfast? Oh, no. No, I don't want to be bloated. OK, but at least eat something. Nobody wants a dead bride. Piece of bacon? Oh, please. Amazing. We seem to be missing the bride. Oh, she's just staying in her room until the big moment. We don't want to see the groom. It's bad luck. What about the groom? Oh, he's still in bed pending bacon Sammy. Has anyone seen Georgie? Probably still trying to avoid Ben. What? Nothing. She's staying in your room, isn't she? Well, I thought so, but she wasn't there before I went to sleep. Oh, weird. Oh, my god, do you think she's with Dylan? No. I didn't think he was her type. Is he? Well, that settles it. Settles what? Oh, well, maybe she was with Amy. Who? Was Georgie staying in your room? No. Must be Dylan then. Dylan? You're doing Lisa's hair and makeup, aren't you? Yeah. When you go up, take that with you. Try to get her to eat at least some. Yeah, sure thing. All right, ladies, I'm going to take this to the groom. See you at the wedding. Bye. All right. I ain't got a napkin. Brekkies. Cheers. You all right, mate? Are you a bit nervous? What I'm about to tell you does not leave this room. All right. Yeah, that's what best men are for. Last night... Yeah? ...I was with Georgie. Oh. I'm sorry, mate. We go way back. And we've always been fond of each other. Hey, it's not the end of the world. And you get on to me now. So... No, that's not it. No? While we were at it, we were attacked. Attacked? This is going to sound insane... By a giant crocodile. A crocodile? It got Georgie. Wait. This is a prank, right? No. No, I'm dead serious. It came out of nowhere, just bit her in half. What's a crocodile doing around here? I don't know. Ben, that doesn't matter. The thing is I can't tell anyone, because then they will know that I was with Georgie. And the wedding... just keep an eye out for it in case it, like, shows up. All right. Oh, you look lovely. Hi. Are you OK? Charlie. Charlie! Dad. Hi. Hi, Mom. Hello, darling. How are you? Yeah, I'm OK, yeah. You seem a bit anxious. Why so nervous? This is the easy bit. It's the next 50 years that's the hard bit. Just keep your eyes peeled, OK? My beautiful daughter. Hi. Sorry. You look stunning, darling. Thank you. You don't know where Georgie is, do you? No. It's just that we kind of thought... Never mind. No one's seen her this morning. We have no idea where she is. Where could she have gone? She had a few drinks last night, yeah? Yeah. She hasn't got a reason to vanish... I mean, her depression, anxiety? No. Can she swim? I think so. OK, I'm going to scout the grounds. You stay here. OK. I hate to say this, but I've got another appointment after this. Oh, OK. All right, yeah. Must be so proud. Hmm. We can't find Georgie. OK. Can we go without her? Without? Dylan's looking for her now. Give us a few minutes. No word? No. The reverend is getting impatient. We may have to go ahead anyway. One must go. Fingers crossed. Fuck. Oh, shit. Shit. If he doesn't turn up in two minutes, we'll have to go ahead without him. No. No, there's no way I'm getting married without my dad. You might have to, babe. Who's going of walk me down the aisle? Well, I can't, can I? That would be weird. I guess I could. I've almost been like a surrogate parent, anyway. I'd like that. Where's her dad? We can't find him. What? It's fine. Hey, you come with a package. Ladies and gentlemen... in these days, I'm obligated to say, and those who identify as neither... It's lovely to see you all here today. And I'm so glad that you could make the journey in these difficult times. Dearly beloved... ...We are gathered here today in the presence of... All mighty god! Get up. Get up. Come on, get up. Get up. Get up. Hey, come on. Come on. get up. Get up. Sarah, there's two of them. Sarah, there's two of them. Wait. Stop. Stop. Stop. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Tara. Oh, my god. Tara, we got to go. Fuck. Running for my car. My car's around the corner. Wait. In here. In here. What the fuck just happened? I don't know. Get it open. Fuck. Oh, guys, I'm going to need first aid. What is happening? Why is this happening? Why is this happening to me on my wedding day? First, my bridesmaid goes missing. And Then my dad goes missing. And then... Do you think it got them? Do you think it's eaten them as well? What if it bites us? What if it gets in here? Don't worry. It can't get in here. Let me in! It's the reverend. Thank you. Thank you. Are you all right? Yes, I'm alive, thank god. But others weren't so lucky. Is it just you? Did you see anyone else? Have you seen Amy or V, my dad? I don't know. Everyone went in different directions. So what do we do? Well, call emergency services, and then hope that thing doesn't get anyone else in the meantime. It's going to be easier said than done. There's no bars. Is there a land line? No. Great. Then we're fucked. Sorry. Don't worry. I think I may have just said similar words myself. What now then? Let's pray. Dear heavenly father, we pray for your help in these trying times. We pray for you to look after us and to protect us against the beast. Where's Neil? I've got to find Neil. No. He went the other way. The car keys. No. Neil's got the keys. Maybe we can make it to the car. It's there. Shh. Don't make a sound. Where's Lisa? We have to find Lisa. Don't worry. I'm sure she's fine. The most important thing is we get safe and we get help. OK. Let's try and get to my car. I've got keys. No! Tabby? I'll start it up. OK, pull yourself together. When in times of stress, always go back to your breathing. Fuck. Oh, come on. Tabby? God. It's all right. You're going to be OK. Let's get you to the car. Maybe we should go back. They might be wondering where we are. Or if we're still alive. Maybe we should just wait here and see if someone comes and finds us. Sarah, don't move. Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit. Oh, my god, what do we do? Find a way out. It's locked. We need to get out of here. Help! Sarah, help! Sarah! Christ, you scared the shit out of me. Sorry. You couldn't be heard screaming. What the hell is that? And where is it? It's a crocodile, but I don't know what species. I thought you were an expert. Not exactly. But I do know it shouldn't be living in this climate. And it's also very dangerous. Tell me something I don't know. You got a twig in your hair. Good. Let me untangle it. Is that your distressed look? You didn't answer my question. Yes, it's out there. And how are we going to kill it? I don't intend to kill it. I intend to catch it. All right, we need a plan. Agreed. Don't look at me. I'm qualified to give spiritual guidance and the like. Escaping man-eating crocodiles is not my speciality. We just need to kill the bloody thing. So let's find a big gun and shoot the bastard. And where do you propose we get a gun from? There was a pair of shotguns on the farm. Great. I'll just teleport to your parents' farm then and get one, shall we? All right, guns are out. Are we going to kill this thing? We don't have to kill it. It's still one of God's creatures. And it's clearly upset. It's upset? The crocodile is upset? Oh, that's all right then that everybody's dying, because the crocodile is having a bad day. I didn't mean- I am upset, OK? In case you hadn't noticed, my wedding day is ruined. And people we know are dead. Right. Just calm down. Don't tell me to calm down. At least we aren't live streaming this. Can you imagine? At least then someone would come to our rescue. Oh, god, I wish my dad was here. He'd know what to do, if he's even still out there. If anyone knows how to deal with a crocodile, it's definitely your dad. Shit. It's Amy. Oh, my god. Fuck. Oh, shit. Shit. Come on, Amy, drive. It's relentless. Catch it? What do you mean, catch it? Exactly that-take it to a zoo, and tag it. Really? So that thing has been rampage at your daughter's wedding, killed I don't know how many people, and you want to catch it and keep it as a pet? That's what I do. I protect animals. Protect them? What about the humans that have died? So you don't care about humans. Some of them. Well, I bet you'd have a different view if that thing got your daughter. She'll be fine. Not to put a damper on things, but how do you know? That thing could have got her like it got Tabby. Practically bit her in half. And it got the camera man and chewed him and... Because I know, all right. She'll be fine. Yeah, that's easy for you to say. It didn't attack you. Yes, it did. Shit. When did that happen? Earlier in the barn. Oh, god, it looks nasty. Let me take a look. Shit, there it is. Shit, Amy's in trouble. Heavenly father, we beseech you to help our friend Amy in her time of need. Please forgive her her sins, whatever they may be. And deliver her safely to us, just like your son, our savior, Jesus Christ, delivered us from evil. Amen. One question, reverend. Where was your holy father when the crocodile started to kill everyone a minute ago? Why should he help Amy what he didn't help them, or my parents, wherever they are? Oh, I don't know. The Lord moves in mysterious ways. Oh, yes, he does. He put a killer crocodile in the middle of fucking Hampshire. It doesn't get much more mysterious, does it? Charles, Amy is in serious danger. This is where all that yoga training pays off. You're safe now. Thank god. No, thank my dad. Did you see him? No, I just know that was him. Oh. The crocodile is still out there. So what are we going to do? We wait. Well, I guess we know what happened to Georgie then. I just wish she'd told someone before she wandered off on her own. That doesn't seem like her. That will be my dad. Oh. Oh, my god. You're all right. Did he get you? I'm fine. Oh, god, we need to find my dad. We need to get you some proper first aid. OK. There might be a first aid kit in the pool house. OK, let's go. Come on. I've got this. It's not pretty. I'm sorry. I can't deal with her being in the pool like that. We'll move her in a minute. Right. Let's see what we can do. You know, I've never seen this side to you before. I thought you were just this womanizing playboy guy who told women he saved leopards for a living. But I don't think that's the real you. After my wife died, I was the real me. It is the real me. Maybe you're living in the past. Maybe. There, try that. You know, for someone without a proper job, you're pretty useful. Maybe we need to work on your flirting a bit. It's Lisa. Where? She's trying to send a message. Top window. Is that Morse code? Yeah, she remembers. Wow. What's she saying? Charlie's wounded. Are you OK? Thank god for text speak. Question for you, reverend. Yes. Being a man of the cloth, why do you think God has done something like this? If I say, he moves in mysterious ways... Wouldn't cut it. Well, then I don't know, I'm afraid. I'm stumped. You don't think it's because we're all evil, we deserve to die? No. No. No. No. There's lots of good people here. There were. You know, I do wonder. All these natural disasters... Hurricanes, floods, fires... People that survive, they often thank God to be alive. But it's the ones that die I think about. What did they do? If God sent the hurricane and the floods, why did he let some people die and some survive, you know? So what do you think your purpose is here? Is this some kind of test? Or is it just a coincidence? I don't believe in such thing as coincidences. You do think it happened for a reason. Whatever reasons they may be. Who knows? Maybe this is your moment, your martyr moment. Maybe you're the one that's going to save us and deliver us. Maybe. Right. My dad is in the pool house with Amy and V. The croc is doing laps of this house. So we just need to time it right so we can get them over here. Where do you want me? You stay here. You call to me as soon as you see it coming. I'll signal to them from upstairs. And then we just need somebody by the back door. Allow me. OK. I'm not seeing it. It's going for the pool house. Wait. You don't think it's... Humans don't knock like that. I've never seen a croc use the door handle yet. Shit. We need to distract it. We need to get it away from there. Wait. Oh, my god. Hey! Hey, crocodile! Come and get me! The reverend is using himself as a decoy. You tell me as soon as the coast is clear. Over here! OK, get ready. Go. Come on. Hey. Hey. God does work in mysterious ways. Easy. Easy. What's wrong? Just a bit of collateral damage. I'll be fine. Hey. So is this all of us? What are your thoughts? Why is this thing here? Did someone put it here? No. I found its nest, and half a tent, and this. I don't know why it's here. I don't know how it survived. But that's why I need to capture it. Capture it? Whoa. Like take it alive? Mate, I know you're all for saving the wildlife. But that thing has killed dozens of people, including my family. And it's trying to get us. Now, if it's easier to kill it, I say, kill it. I agree. Dad, I know you want to save it, but that thing is dangerous. You're already injured. Can we please just be sensible? If we can capture it, if it's at all possible, let's do that. So now what? We stay put. We batten down the hatches, keep it out. We've got food. We can survive until someone comes to help us, or we can find some opportunity to escape. In the meantime, we shut and bolt the doors. We shut the windows. We double check them. And we make weapons... Knives, sticks, boiling water, whatever we can... to hurt it, to slow it down, to trap it. We make this place a fortress. I don't see the point in this. It's a hotel. It's not like we're going to find heavy duty rope or a tranquilizer gun. If you do find a tranquilizer gun, use it on me. It's starting to sting a little. Nothing up there but a load of old bed sheets. I only found a couple of kitchen knives. I don't think anyone expected this place to be under siege. I found a fire poker and croquet mallets. What are these? They're clothes. They're your clothes, aren't they? Uh... You were wearing them last night. I remember. There are photos of us together. So what were they doing stashed downstairs? I went on a walk last night after everyone had gone to bed. And I was a little drunk. I couldn't see where I was going. And I walked face first into the pond. When I got back, I threw them down there, because I didn't want anyone to see me soaking wet. I cut myself when I was in the pond. They've got to have a sign, or a fence, or something. It's insane. Bullshit. You were Georgie, weren't you? No. Don't lie to me. I know you were with her. Just tell me the truth. I know you've always had a thing for her. OK, we went on the walk together. But that's all that happened. I swear. The crocodile attacked her, and I freaked out. You fucking liar. Do you know how I know? Because I've told plenty of lies. I should drag you out there, feed you to the fucking crocs. Dad, stop, please. Tell me why I shouldn't. Punishment usually needs to fit the crime. Oh, it does. Stop. Enough people have died today. We don't need to go there, no matter how much you think. I'm so sorry. It meant nothing. God, what an excuse. So when you proposed to me, did that mean nothing? Or our wedding vows, if we had got that far, would they have meant nothing? I'm so done with you. Asshole. I'll be right back. You, don't say a word. And you, give me that. My life is a mess, Amy. God, it's a disaster. I have a pointless job that serves no real purpose, something my dad likes to remind me of every time he sees me. My wedding day has gone from shit to worse. And I just found out that my fiancee has been shagging one of my friends, my friend who is now dead. And to top it off, we are still being hunted by the crocodile from hell. I'm not going to lie... You're not living your best life right now. But your job isn't pointless. Millions of people appreciate what you do. And as for Charlie, it's a good job you found out now. Imagine if you'd married him. Once a cheat, always a cheat. True. We're going to avenge your friend's death and kill that damn crocodile. Yeah. Good. Is there anything else I can help you with? Yeah, make me a sandwich. I'm fucking starving. So what, we just wait until someone finds us? I guess so. It could take ages. I know. And we don't even have the Wi-Fi to entertain us. Oh, guess I'll make a.. Good idea. I'll see if anyone else wants one. It's in the house! The crocodile's in the house! It's inside. It's down there. It can't climb stairs, can it? It'll figure them out. We need to block the stairs. Oh, fuck sake. OK. Well... OK. ...That should stop it for now. Lisa, are you OK? Yeah, we're all right. I'm not sure I trust this door, though. Stay there. I'll figure it out. You guys OK? Yeah. What now? I have a revolver in the car. You've had a gun this whole time? I keep it for emergencies. And it's only just now become an emergency? Yeah, there's one problem. The keys are on the stand next to my coat. That's the end of it. Yeah. Come on then. Where the fuck's the croc? I don't know. We got them! I'm going out the window. Good luck. Cock it. Undo safety. Dylan, kill this thing now! Dad, what was that? That. Now, listen, it's up to you to now. You're going to have to work out how to kill it. Remember everything I've taught you. Use your initiative. I know you can do it. OK. All right, think. Think. What do we have? What can we use? You lure it in. I'll cave it's head in with this. You're on your own there. No. No, I think we need less direct methods. Glass will slow it down. Yeah, but then what? We set fire to it. I like the way you think. And we have flares. So we take the flares, and we guide it to an outbuilding, and shut the door, and set fire to it. We could use the pool house. We could drop it in the pool. No. No, it'd just climb out. Well, can we drain it? Maybe we don't have to. What's that? It's venison from Neil's farm. It's supposed to be for dinner. Well, don't fuck this up. I mean, shame to waste it. Make her proud.
