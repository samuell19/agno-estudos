What's going on? I'm annoyed. You annoy me. - Do you want to leave? - Yes. Then do that. No. Now you're like my mother. - But I'm not your mother. - No. I know that. But she's like that. She insist on being here, but she don't really want to. - And that annoys you? - Yes. What about your father? He just drank. - And now you're punishing her? - Yes. Because you don't want to become close to her? - But you want her to be close to you? - Yes. No, I don't. But you want someone to be close to you? Yes. - Close your eyes. - Why? It's just a test. Would be nice to try. Close your eyes... And focus on seeing your mother in front of you. What was her expression like when you were born? Try to envision it. No. I see nothing. No. It's not certain that it was there. Our time is up. That means we're getting twins. Dear Marte. I'm glad I know you. And I'm glad I know your family. Especially your brother. And I'm glad you picked me. Or perhaps it was me who chose you. I remember the first time we met. Here at the dance academy. - You were so cool. - Yes... You had a certain attitude. Like you owned the place. And I knew I wanted to befriend that person. I wanted to be like her. And I thought the same thing the first time I came to your home. I want to be here. I sound like a stalker now, but I suppose I am. And you accepted me. So know I'm just - Congratulations. - Thank you. - Marco and Marte. Cheers. - Cheers. Let me see. Are you performing Swan Lake? Are you the black or the white swan? Shit. What was the swan's death like, again? - Stop it! - Both legs together. Then the children enters. Go away! I'm in the spotlight now. - You're not taking me seriously. - I do take you... No, you're not. My rockstar... They are too much. No! Don't do that just because you're going on tour. - Thank you. - De nada, cabr?n. It's a little weird for me when you make out with my brother. I have a brother too. A half-brother whom you never met. I don't want you to leave. Me neither. - Bye. - Bye. Let me see how large wings you can make. Good! And in a nice ring. Imagine being king swans and queen swans, with large wings. And now an eagle is changing them. Fly faster! - Does everyone remember their positions? - Yes. - Number one or two? - Two. Hedda is there. - Bye. - Bye. Bye. See you next time. May I help you with anything? I wanted to see where you're workplace was. All right. Were you wondering about anything? No, I'm just curious. I don't understand what it is you're doing. What do you mean? You were sneaking around my house, looking inside. - What do you want? - Nothing. I think you and your self-obsessed mother - - shoud stay away from me. Do you understand? Go to hell. Fuck off. - Who was that? - My brother. I thought you two looked alike. - He's more similar to my mother. - You're right. It's embarrasing. I didn't think he'd recognize me. - Does he live in Oslo? - Yes. Why haven't you said anything? I'm not sure. - Nice costume. - Oh, well... It's pressing against my ovaries. I think it's making me infertile. The lawyers doesn't want anymore children. So they design the world's tightest... Fuck. - Do you want to get pregnant? - Yes. You... May I have this dance? - Marte! - Yes! No! Begin with some "Cats". This one. Do you remember this? Then it goes over to... Fifth floor. The doors open.. - Hey. - Hey. - You father's asleep, but your mother's there. - Yes, I know. - Hey. - Hey. - Hey. - Hey. - I got an A on the exam. - That's great. Not bad with a full-time job. Look My counselor was a bit sceptic... I based it on the tv-show "Dr. Quinn". - May I read it? - Of course. "'The Virginian' by Owen Wister is often viewed - - as a romantic illustration of the perfect relationship - - between the ideal man and the ideal woman, - - meeting, falling in love and getting married. The male character achieves a successful career. Whilst the female character gives birth to a alot of children. Tompkins points out that the woman meating the man from Virginia, - - the story of a hetersexual paradise, is what Wister wants to believe in. " Isn't that unbelievable? The woman is simply a hen. While the man... Do you remember that guy with the long face? He's a horse. Yes. - From New York. - Thank you. I have to get going. What's going on? Dad! - Where's mom? - She's coming by later. - Hey. - Hey. - Do you want to come in? - I'm going up... - This is where we live. - Wow. This is the living room. We've been living here for two years, but not everything's in place. I think's it's really nice. This is mom. It's an old picture, but it's so beautiful. So pretty! She's so beautiful. Look. There's your mother. Do you know how old she is? - 18. - She looks so open. She's alot. She's intense. Laughs a lot and out loud. But she's impressing me too. Always something going on. These days, she's studying for a masters degree - - in american, feminist western litterature. How old were you when they separated? I think it was hard on mom that she didn't get to meet you. But I'm sure your dad had his reasons. Is that what she's been telling you? Yes... It was your mother who left. She just disappeared. - Can I get you anything? - No, no. It must be strange with your mother not telling you anything. It's getting late. I said I'd get by the office before 23. - Now? - It's the monthly settlement. Everyone's late. I have to get going. Then go together. - Have a beer afterwards. - I suppose we could do that. Tonight's not a good time to have a beer. I've got a lot to do. It would be nice if we could do it some other time. Alright. - Absolutely.. - Good. We could do that. Is it boring? I get it. Will there be an after party? Come. - Where you're from? - We're only visiting. - From Str?mstad. - Are you coming? - Yes. - Nice. - Where are we going? - The Ministry of Labour. - Oi! - Cool. I've only had drinks there. Don't know what the food's like. We were invited along, I should say. - Are you the ones doing it? - The politicians can't do everything. I have to get out of here. I'm counting down from three before you slam your head into the table. - What? - Slam it as hard as you can. Three... ...two, one. I was just kidding. - Are you okay? - Yes. I didn't think you'd do it. You're insane. You remember mom, but you haven't met my dad. No. I never lived... I was born when our mother lived in Sweden. But he must've been there. - Or she was here. - Yes. We're not going here. I think we're in the basement. - Do you think there's sensors on the sides? - Does it have sensors? - Check this. - Bye. Hey, dad. This is Henrik. Can you believe that we're siblings. It's crazy. Hey, sis. Wait. Wait. Sit still. Pig. - Dad? - Are you awake? - Get to bed. - I don't want to. - Yes, come on. - No, I don't want to. - Bye - Bye! - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. I'm thinking about publishing my paper. In "Western American" or "Gender Society". Isn't that fun? Yes. You said you were here with someone. - Yes - Who was it? I was here with Henrik. My brother. He's living here now... You're sticking your nose up someone elses business. Does dad know? Was I wanted? You're so mean. So incredibly mean. Have you decided yet? It's still the lunch menu. We got married today. Congratulations. Thanks. Let's begin with a bottle of Barbaresco. Yes. Great. It's Marte's. There you go. A gift. Put it on. - Could you...? - What are you going to do? - A roll. - You cannot dive here. - But I'm not diving. - Don't. Look how shallow it is. - Don't. - But I'm doing my trick. For fuck's sake, stop it! Sorry. Did you know I was in Norway once when I was 18? And? I found your house. You opened the door and told me to come by later because your mother was asleep. I became jealous. I looked at you and thought: "I should've lived here!" I probably hated you a bit. - Hello. - Hello. No! - Wait. - You have a tiny face. I'm revealing my tiny head. - Stop it. - I have a more elegant version. Yes, yes, yes. It's the girl with pearl earrings. Thanks. How are you? I don't know. I'm scared. It's the first time I feel that everything's in place. Welcome to your voicemail. You have one new message. It's mom. You have to get her right away. Can I come inside? They told me to go upstairs... Dad's dead. Are you in the middle of something? No, it's fine. - Hey. - Hey. Why aren't you answering your phone? There's a alot needing to be taken care of. Hey. - Is everything all right? - Yes. She wanted me to come along. Dag is considering canceling the tour. I've been speak... I'm calling him again. - Is he not coming? - No. - Why not? - There's no point. - Shall I make some coffee? - Yes. Henrik's here. Do you want to see him? I'm... Shit. Can I call you later? Of course. Yes... - Thank's for coming. - Yes. I was just... - We'll talk later. - Yeah, just call. That was beautiful. I was touched. - I didn't know you could sing. - Thank you. Charlotte always said I could sing, so I just... - I'll do it. - Did I say that? Yes. - Hey. - Heyi. Oh, God... - It's been a long time. - Hey. This is nice. It's not often. But I'm seeing Charlotte every day. - And it's very nice. - Yes, go ahead and hire me. She's very good. I'm pleased she's here. You have to come see her There's a show on... There's no date yet. It's not that long. You have to come. - If I get a message, I will. - Of course you will. - I need a cup of coffee. - There's wine too if you... - Can we help you with anything? - Anyone want more coffee? What's going on? With your brother. What's going on with him? - Yuk! - What? I'm sweating like crazy. Yuk! I think... I was going to give it back. And then... Sorry. Charlotte... It's okay. You... What's going on? - Is everything alright? - Yes. Shall I take it? Like that. - I'm joining the others. - Yeah. If you make a mistake, - - and do this: 'Oh, I made a mistakel', then everyone sees it. But if I simply continue dancing, nobody sees it. - What were you thinking, Mina? - What day is it? - It's Thursday. - The one coming up? It's not long. It's two more times. It'll be fine. What where you thinking, Hedda? I know someone named Nora, and it's my big sister. Perhaps she'll come and watch. Do you think so? I'm looking forward to next time. That's it for today. Thank you. Thank you, Ida. Give me a hug. See you nex ttime. You're so good. I watched for a little while. You... I'd like to meet him. If he wants to meet me, that is. - What is it? - What? I'm sorry. You don't want anything to do with me. Mom... - I'm your mother. - Oh, stop it! If you want us to be close, then stop pretending to be a mother. Because you're not. You never was. I've been trying. I did my best. It's not enough. It wasn't good enough. No. No. I was only nineteen. When I got married. Leaving Henrik is the worst thing I've ever done. When you came along, I thought it'd be a new beginning... But everything went wrong. I couldn't touch you. I wanted to do things the right way in your case... It... Yeah. - I weren't able to. - No. Unfortunately. - That's it. - Yeah. That's it. Can I see him? Please? Debit or cash? Debit. Hey. Hey. Come inside. - The pool's empty. - Yes, completely empty. It would've been really cold anyway. - Really cold. - It's the middle of winter. But in the summer, there'll be water and... - Does anyone like pizza? - No. - Pizza! - Do you want pizza? - That one. - You want that slice? - All right? - Yes. - On the plate? - We'll put it there. - Can I hold him for a while? - More olives. - How long are you staying for? - For as long as we want.

That Marte's pregnant? - Yes. - Hasn't she told you? We haven't seen each other in a couple of days. It's been very busy. Why don't you, I and Marte go out for dinner sometime? - We miss you. - Yes, I agree. - I'll be nice. - Yes, it will. Bye. - See you. - Nice to meet you. It can't stop. No! It's flying nicely.

Legs out, head down, right? Then we dig it, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. What's happening after that? Five, six, seven, eight, then we go. One, two, three, four. Out, in, out and stretch your arms. Like that. And then you... - Is it okay that I came here? - Yes, it's fine. My dad is helping Marco with is application letter for BI. He was almost done with his bachelor back in Mexico. But he has to start all over again over here. - Oh my God.. - Yeah. Kirsten seemd happy about becoming a grandmother. Yes. I was gonna tell you... Isn't it a bit early? Are you sure that's what you want? What do you mean by that? It's hard imagining you becoming a mother. What do you mean? What are you doing? Oh my god. I didn't mean it like that. I could be a godmother. I don't know what to do. No, you don't know what to do. You don't know! Stop it, for fuck's sake! I can't take it anymore. You... You're too much. You suck all the energy out of me. You're being pushy to me and everyone else. We may have welcomed you, but you're not a member of this family. Thanks. I've been waiting a long time for you to say that. Hey. You weren't supposed to come back for another week. We weren't up for it anymore. Those last eating places were bad.
