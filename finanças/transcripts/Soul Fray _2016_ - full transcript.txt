When we were younger, Danny and I used to go down to the dock at night and look at the moon reflecting on the lake. We'd stare for hours at the water. Wondering what secrets it was keeping from us. Never suspecting how dark those secrets might be. Claire! Help! Help me. Swim to me. Come on, come on. Give me your hand. Come on Danny, come on, Danny. It's okay, it's okay. Can you grab the dock, I promise I'm not gonna let go. I'm not gonna let go. I just need you to help me. Danny, give me your other hand. Can you grab the dock? Stop panicking and help me! I'm trying! Mom, Dad! Help! I'm trying. Don't let go. I've gotcha, I'm not gonna let go. I'm not gonna let go. Can you grab the dock? (Latin) With the light comes the dark. Claire? Danny! Danny! Danny! Danny! My brother was the first of many to be taken by the darkness. His death started everything. Going, going... Gone. We've officially reached the dead zone. Uh, just as well. Plenty of stuff to do up here. Go swimming, hiking, swimming... A little more hiking. A little more swimming? Hey, we can never have too much swimming. I remember loving coming up here as a kid though. Grandfather used to bring me up here all the time. Bet the cabin hasn't changed a bit since I was six. Perfect distraction for a troubled mind. Speaking of whom, wake up sleepyhead. We're almost there. Lake Miraton. Most quietest, calmest, overall peaceful-est place in West Virginia. You woke me up to look at trees. Not just any trees, Mike. Evergreens. Evergreens. Wahoo. Cheer up, Mike. After all, this whole trip is about you. See now you say that, but I actually would have been just as happy alone in my bedroom. At home, shades drawn, sitting in the dark. See and that's exactly why we're here. We all know what it feels like to be dumped. For the record, I did not get dumped. It was a mutual agreement. Sure. You guys agreed mutually that she was dumping you. Come on, Mikey. If you resolve to have a good week, you'll make it a good week. I'm your sister, would I lie to you? Yeah. You wound me, Mike. I am wounded. All right kids, take note. Now passing the last public access building for 15 miles. I mean, fine, just throw my stuff out of the way. Aj, this is awesome. I know, cool, right? Yeah! Wait till you see the inside. Whoo! Four years old. Four years old. Hurry up, slow pokes. Same as before. Mike, come on, man. You're draggin'. What? Aj, this is so cool. I know. Cool little spot, right? Yeah. Your grandfather built this? Yep, my grandfather was a man of many talents. I see... I'm... I'm... Gonna go put stuff in my room. Bad Mikey, what are you doing? Eryn, give it back. What are you doing with this? Quit screwing around. Bad Mikey! Seriously, that's all I have left. Please. Please. Put it away. If I see it again, I'm gonna confiscate it. What are you, cabin leader? Nope, that would be me. And I take my job very seriously. You are here to cleanse yourself of that girl, not mope around and wonder what you could have said or done differently. Are you saying there's something I could've said or done differently? That was a test. Ow. You failed the test. Man, look, you gotta do something to take your mind off this girl. You brought you sketch book, right? Draw something up. Like the good ol' days. All right. Fine. There you go. Oh, boy. All right, come help me restart the generator. It's a two man job. This place runs on a generator? My grandfather was an architect. Not an electrician. Do you... Need help with any of that? Not.. It just looks like... Yeah, actually, yeah, that would be really nice actually. Okay, cool. I just.. It looked like you were struggling a little bit. A little bit. Um, I'm Mike from next... 206. Cabin over. 206, yeah. Awesome, err, it's nice to meet you. I'm Angie. Angie. Mm-hmm. Nice to meet you. So you, you know the cabin numbers by heart? Oh, yeah. Just a little bit. Probably not your first time up here? No, it's not actually. Around this time last year I was here at the same cabin with the same group of guys. Um, but I have one of those photographic memory kind of things, so that's how I remember your cabin number. I'll look at the cabin numbers, or on the mailboxes, see on the street, I'll just remember them for the rest of my life. Oh, that's handy, I guess. Uh, I don't know though. I've never really had to, you know, recall said cabin numbers to anybody before. Cute. You're laughing on the inside. Did you mean to hand this to me? Oh! ooh, sorry. I meant to take that back. Thank you, though. I really appreciate that. No problem. It was really nice of you. Sure. Hey, Babe. What's the hold up? Did you get everything? Yes, Pete. I.. I got everything. Hey, man. Pete. Hi. Mike. What... What's going on over here. I was... Mike was helping me with the bags. You know, 'cause I was doing it all by myself. Yeah, I was just walking by. Oh, okay. That's mighty friendly of you, buddy. Yeah, no problem. I mean, she just looked like she was struggling and I was walking by... Awesome, well, you be happen to be walking by back to your cabin now? Don't be an ass. Yeah. no. I'm gone. It was nice meeting you. You too. What the hell? You're such a fucking jerk, you know that? You okay? Yeah. Fine. Hey, man. Don't feel bad. It was an awesome effort. I said I'm fine. Can we just drop it? Heard about the attempt. You heard lies. No attempt was made. Oh, come on, Mikey. You put yourself out there. I'm proud of you. For god's sake, I said "Hello" and she said "Hello" back. Okay, that's it. As far as I can remember, any relationship I've ever been in started with "Hello." That... Damn. How long did it take you to come up with that one? Couple hours. We're gonna head up to that grocery/hardware store we saw on the way in. Pick up some essentials. Mostly alcohol. Wanna come? No, man. I'm good. I'm kind of enjoying the peace and quiet out here. It's cool. You got it bro. Seriously, you should talk to her. Like more. You got a whole week here, you might as well enjoy some of it. I am perfectly content. Mm-hmm. I can see that. I love you. Love you, too. Hey, are we going or what? Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Whoa. And he's an artist. Hey. Hi. Not much into the "Baywatch" scene, I guess? No. Not so much. Mind if I join you? Hey, mind if I take a look? Um... I guess. That one you can skip past. Oh. Okay. Mike, these are really good. I'm sure you could do something with some of these. I'm not a... I'm not a professional or anything. I just... I don't know, I do it to pass the time. Some peace of mind. But um, Eryn always says that too, that I should do something with it. Oh, Eryn is my sister. You'll probably see her around. Oh, wait, is this your sister? No. No, that is a... Let's say it's a dream that didn't come true. Shit. Yeah. I'm sorry. Me too. Okay, let's change the subject. Can I ask you a question? Sure. That guy, Pete. Oh. We're not together. Like, not even a little. So why does he think that you are? It's complicated. To say the least. Is it? Okay, look, I'll tell you my whole story, the good, the bad, everything. Beginning to end. Uncut. But you have to promise not to judge me for it. Please? Okay. Okay. You know what kind of stuff Mike drinks? Um, just stay away from brand names, anything that's in the back corner, bottom shelf... Something no one else would like. Guarantee you he'll love it. Oh! I am so sorry. No, it's me. It's all me. Oh, my god. Is it broken? No. all empties and drink cartons. You're fine. Okay. It looks okay. Yeah, see? You're fine. No, it was my fault. Oh, sorry. I should be more careful. Yeah. So are you visiting? Uh, yeah. How could you tell? Uh, around this time of year. We always get more people in the store. Tourist season. That means you live here? Like permanent resident? Year round? Home sweet home. So you can tell me all the cool places to check out. You know? Like hiking trails. Bears... Bears? I don't know, could be bears. Okay, well, I imagine you've already been to the lake? That's miraton's one big selling point. Um, other than that, stick to the trails? Don't go off by yourself too much. Oh... Really? Not to scare you or anything. We've just had a few people go missing lately. So... Missing? Like never to be seen again missing? Well, so far, yeah. Oh. um. But that shouldn't worry me. Yeah, so I'm not very good at small talk. As we now know. Vincent? Or being a shop boy, apparently. Well, it was nice talking to you. Yeah, you too. Have fun at the lake. Thanks. How're ya doing? Doing all right. Oh, good. Thanks. Is that it, all set? Yep, should be. Great, let me ring you up. Can't seem to keep people interested in the area? Don't let.. Don't let that unnerve you. My shop boy, he would have people around here believing that folks are just disappearing, vanishing without a trace. Like some sort of ghost story or something. Simple truth is it's pretty common around tourist season, people come and they see the beautiful scenery, and they see our quaint, quiet, little town. And they say to themselves, "I think I'm gonna settle down here." Seasons come, seasons change, people do too. And come winter all of a sudden they remember, "I've got something big to do back in the city." And poof, just like that. They're gone. So, uh, that's your theory? Fickle tourists? That or bigfoot. Bigfoot. Bigfoot... Hey, mind if I ask you a question? Go ahead, shoot. We have a cabin right on the lake. Belonged to my grandfather. Walter Gravewaters. Oh, yeah. And right across from us is this lonely lookin' house. The Lochewood House. Yeah, does anyone live there? I could have swore I seen a girl checkin' us out when we pulled in. Yeah, that was just Claire. Poor Claire. Used to live there with her folks and her brother. It's just her there now. They moved away? Her folks did. Yeah, they tried like crazy to get her to move away with them. But she was adamant about staying put. Um... Bought the place right out from under them. And the brother? Yeah... Yeah, he drowned. Wow. About two years ago now. Jeez. Yeah. It's right about that time that Claire lost it. We used to see her around town all the time, just smiling all the time, just happy all the time. But then, oh my gosh. After the accident, She just doesn't come out of the house at all. Just to come, just to stock up on food and lighter fluid. She feels bad about it. She really does. She was there when he fell into the lake. Wow. Wow. I can see why she keeps to herself. I mean, I know I'd be a wreck if I ever lost my brother. She won't give you folks any trouble. But those guys that have the cabin next to yours, they're gonna be nothing but trouble. Uh, they don't worry me much. But thanks for the heads up. You betcha. Let me, let me, let me get my assistant and give you a hand. Vincent? Yeah. Give us a hand getting their stuff out to their car. On your left. Oh, sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Are you okay? Yeah, are you? Okay. Yeah, I'm cool. Okay, cool. Well, anyway. Beneath this playful exterior you see, really just lies an emotionally damaged woman with a shitload of scaring underneath. My dad left when I was ten. My mom did the constitutional minimum required of an American parent at the time. And by the time I was 18, I thought was in a committed relationship with the baddest bad boy of my town. But around a year ago, I told myself, I was gonna do better. You know, never fall for the same traps again. And I've been doing really well, actually. For the first time, in a long time, I feel really good about myself. And I don't mean to sound arrogant or anything, but I think that's really awesome. I mean... That is great. And don't let me rain on your parade, but I mean if that's the case, then why share a cabin with him? I slipped. A little bit ago. Ah. I told him it didn't mean anything though. With Pete, he looks at me and he sees the same old Angie, he could just use and abuse her just the same. But I'm not that girl anymore. I can relate, in a way. I didn't really love the girl I was dating. We weren't really good for each other. Frankly, a break up was kind of inevitable. It's just that, I thought if I lost her... Maybe I'd never find anyone else. And more than anything I didn't want to end up alone. But you know, a guy like you, with friends and a little sister... Who would go through lengths and miles to see you smile, is never alone. Yeah, I know. They are the best. And I know they'll always be there for me. It's just... I just wish they weren't the only ones. You know? Just once. I just feel like I want someone to... See me. See me. How are you guys doing? (Latin) (Latin) You are one, and we are many. By dawn, there will be nobody left to save. Are you okay? Yeah. Just a little high strung I guess. Yeah, I guess so. You know, you've worked overtime, gosh, something like the last two weeks in a row. I think you need a day off. I'm fine, really. I think, I think you need to take a long weekend. The tourists have all passed through, and I can handle the store myself, I think. For a day. Okay. all right. Thanks, Mr. Odgeby. Sure. Lock up and I'll see you on Monday. Will do. And Vincent... Yeah? One more thing. Hell yeah, I told you they'd pull it together. Hail to the skins, Baby. Pete, you're missing the game of the century over here. Shut up, gaywad. I'm coming. The end of an era. In the absence of a woman, Pete has to make his own sandwich. Yeah, where did your girl get off to? Ha, probably fucking lost in the woods or something. On some nature walk. Well, should someone go look for her, it's getting pretty dark outside. And miss the game? Bitch wants to go exploring, she can find her own way back. Fair enough. Toss me a beer. Thank you. So Angela, you seem like a good woman, my boy sure does need one. No, no, no, no. You play on marrying Mike? No. No, you should know. No. Stop. stop. Stop. He still can't tie a necktie for shit. That's your job now. Aj. Oh, relax, Mike. Look, you're panicking her. Stop it. We're just having a little fun... At your expense. And hers. Stop it. Okay, all right, okay. Toast, to the newest member of our little family. I'm sorry. That's all right. Angela O'Murphy. Who to me, doesn't look Irish at all. I'm just saying. Nice. Welcome to the family. Cabin 206. Cheers. Cheers. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Happy to be here. So it's been a while since we had another girl in our midst. Mind if I ask what shampoo you use? Uh, that's my cue. Time to go do something manly. Come on, Mike, let's go chop down a tree or something. Are you.. Hold on. Are we actually.. Mike, let's go. Are you.. I'll be back? Dude, are you. Are we seriously... Or are you just talking nonsense? Very well played, you two. You sure know how to tag team. We have a lot of experience. So what did you really want to talk about? You, mostly. What you're looking for, what you're expecting. Oh. I see. You want to see if I'm a good fit. But don't take it the wrong way. No. No, no, no. Not at all. I wish I had a sibling who would look out for me every once in a while. I mean, see you two interact and... You mean the world to Mike and Mike means the world to you. I'm just an outsider. I mean, if I didn't get the third degree, I'd be kind of offended. Well, he really likes you. I... I kinda like him. He's sweet. And it's been a while since a nice guy who showed any interest in me. He's probably the nicest guy that I know. And he really could use a good girl. Please, don't hurt him. I promise. Cross my heart. Two promises. Pinky swear. Like from the... Yeah. Do we do this? Isn't it better with thumbs? What the.. I don't know what we just did there. By the way, I use off-brand shampoo. The real secret is I use paper towels to dry off. That works? You tell me. Oh! 'Cause look at... Look at her hair! Look at her go. Beautiful. So... You got... You got some of it... Yeah. It's kinda stuck to your lip. Oh, shit. (Latin) No! Not in the middle of the game! Pete, what is it with this place? You said it was sturdy. It is. Shut your face. I'm gonna go check the power box. You're just gonna leave us here sitting in the dark? Put on your big boy pants and deal with it. Do you think Pete's being so moody because he knows his girl is out walking around with some nerd? Del, wouldn't you be if it was your girl? Dude, I'm gay. Nuh-uh. Wait. No, seriously, are you really? Not again. Hand check, people. Did the generator run out of gas or something? Probably. All right, I'm on it. Hold up, Mike. Hold up, wait, wait. What? Why? What's up? Fucking Angie. Thinks she can walk away from me like that. Now I've gotta deal with this stupid freakin' power. What the hell? (Latin) God damn it. I can't see shit. I feel like one of those... Bitches in a horror movie. Shit. Whoa! This way. Well... What's up? Why are we stopping? This is not a good time to be stopping? They're not following us. So... Isn't that a good thing? No, not it's not a good thing. We're being herded like sheep. Herded where? I'm thinking here. Holy shit. (Latin) Guys, we're in deep shit here. Hey! This way. My house, quickly. Are you kidding me? That's back towards ground zero. At this point, what do we have to lose? Fuck. Watch my back, this is gonna take a second. You're Claire, right? Girl from next door? The one that everyone thinks is paranoid. You wanna chat or do you wanna live to see tomorrow? (Latin) Here, take this. Okay then, let's go. Duck. Door, door, door. Door! Door! Door! Door! To be paranoid is simply to be over prepared at the wrong time. Jesus. So bright. Why is it so bright? Dude, guys, watch your step. Sorry. Well, gee, you have enough light? No. Interesting. Look, you all have plenty of questions. I can understand that. I have some of the answers. But before I can have a serious conversation with any of you, I need you all to be willing to believe in some pretty crazy shit. Well, you got all of us here. So tell us what you know. This lake is a doorway. From where or to where I don't know. But I do know that something is getting through from the other side. Something that shouldn't be here. Okay. You're talkin' monsters? Like "Swamp Thing?" I'm talking about evil. Pure, malicious, conscious, evil. I'm talking about a darkness that is spreading like the fucking plague and commandeering the bodies of the locals. You can't be serious. Can't I? Recognize anyone out there? Shopkeepers. Neighbors. What would you rather believe, they all suffered some sort of psychotic break together? Good people gone bad over night? I don't know, maybe there's some sort of sickness going around. Then why would we be immune? Maybe we aren't. Maybe we're going to get sick too. It's only a matter of time. We should be getting the hell out of here. Good luck with that. I'd wager there are dozens of them outside right now. Waiting for one of you to step out that door, so they can rip you apart. What's keeping them from getting in here, huh? They didn't have any problem getting into our place. They don't like my pretty lights. I don't know, I wanna believe you but this all sounds.. Insane. Crazy. Look, you don't have to believe me. But if you all want to live, you have to at least listen to me. You have no idea what you're dealing with. Do you? Yeah, that's a good point. I mean, assuming we believe you... And that is a pretty big assumption... How do you know all this? If you want us to believe you, you have to tell us everything. Come with me. It smells horrible down here. Oh, god. What the.. Who's that? Meet my brother. Why... Why is your brother chained to a chair? Because he's patient zero. If you have questions, feel free to ask. He has to reason to lie to you. He's going to kill us all anyway. Oh... Who.. What are you? We are the darkness. We are infinite. We are death. We? We are one entity. The vessel before you is one of hundreds, just like it. It feels no pain. It feels no hunger. A tool. No more, no less. Okay, let's try this a different way. What do you want? Freedom. Freedom? Freedom from the tomb in which we have been locked for so long. Freedom to walk the world of man. So why not take us then? Why are we a threat to you? Wretched human. You are no threat to us. We simply use your flesh as a means to an end. They can only possess the dead. They wear our corpses like a suit to safely cross between the worlds. Why only the dead? I mean, granted, I didn't see all 28 "Exorcist" movies, but isn't possession something that normally happens to the living? Your souls. A body with no soul has no light. A body with no light can be used. We kill to extinguish your souls, to extinguish light. Now you understand. This isn't a war. It's an extermination. By sunrise they'll have taken the entire town. Well, we have to stop 'em. We have to do something. It's too late. There are too many of them to fight now. I was barely even able to save you. So what then? Your.. Your plan is just sit here and wait to be sieged? Yeah. Sunrise is in five hours. They can't be out during the day. We have rations and defenses here to last twice as long. Well, what about everyone else? We can't save everyone. So you're not even going to try? Yeah, come on. It's not right. Guys, where did Angie go? After everything you just heard, you still wanna go out there? There are three guys not two miles away from here. They're like sitting ducks unless we go do something about it. Angie, if all of this is real, don't you think we a little outnumbered? Look, they're assholes. Every one of them. But they don't deserve to die. And yeah, I'm officially scared shitless, but I can't just... Mike! She's right. We can't just sit back and let them get torn to shreds. You're insane. We'll be as safe as we can be about it. You must dye your hair. There is no "Safe." Even here we're at risk, but at least here we're armed and prepared. For Christ's sake. It's a sure promise. We'll take the car you got parked outside. Be less than five minutes gone, give minutes coming. Look, I'm with you. It's a bad idea. It's not safe. But if my friends are going, I gotta go with them. Fine. You all wanna play hero, have at it. But you are not dragging me down with you. I will have no part in this. Let's go. It's so quiet. Yeah. That's not at all terrifying. The place is a whole lot bigger on the inside than it looks from the outside. How many floors, Angie? There's three. Top, basement and here. I don't like the idea of us splitting up, but time is a factor. Someone, buddy system. Eryn and I, you two. Meet back up in ten minutes with whatever intel you fine. Ten minutes. Not a second later. Do you really think they could still be alive? Wouldn't get my hopes up. I never said, thank you. You know, for coming with me. You didn't have to do that. I mean... You don't have to thank me. I wouldn't let you come out here alone. I know, but... All the same, just... Thank you. You're welcome. Angie.. Yeah? You know what, there's probably a better time to talk about stuff. Yeah. No, sure. It's okay. A thought just occurred to me. Shouldn't we be contacting the police or some local authority figure? I mean, I just kinda feel like, what's the point? Shh. You... You came. You guys took half my shit. If you die out here, I'll never see it again. Thank you. It's still three hours till sunrise. Don't thank me yet. Mike. No. Stop. What? Don't look. What's going on? You gotta trust me on this one. Okay. I need the key. What? Give me the key. Come on. There you go. What? are they... I've... I've never seen a dead body before. It's okay. It's okay, okay? Mike, Angie, what happened? Everything okay? Welcome back to the Fray. We found 'em. Angie, I'm so sorry. Hold on, you found the bodies? The actual bodies? How many times do I have to explain the system to you people? Anyone who wants to live will listen to me very carefully. Me. I'm listening. (Latin) You can't hide from us forever. Go! You! No, you! Uh! what's hot! What's up? (Latin) Wait! Where are you going? My house is in the opposite direction! It sure is. And so are the herds of those demon people. Look, I'm driving to fucking Canada. I'm not stopping until the sunrise. I am totally on board with that. You think they're gonna just let us go? We won't know until we try, now will we? At what point are you going to reevaluate your personal strategies and start listening to me. It could be any number of things. Bridge is out. Or a road is closed. Or... Or we're out of gas. Or we're out of gas. God damn it. It's an hour and a half until sunrise. What do you suggest we do then? We go to Odgeby's. What? They already got to Vincent. We're not gonna fare any better. We're not gonna be greeting our undead clientele with a folksy "Howdy" so much as a pipe wrench to the skull. Look, anything I don't get shipped, I get at Odgeby's. He'll have flashlights, blunt weaponry, maybe even a flare or two if he's restocked recently enough. Staying at or returning to my house would have been the best option. But since that option's now off the table... We have to make it work. And you'd better hurry up, too. Okay. Flashlights, flares, lighters and aerosol cans, anything you can find. We're gonna have to barricade all of the entrances. And hurry up. It won't take them long to cut the power. Anything? Flashlights, shovel, big flashlights didn't have batteries. It's a slow start, but it's better than nothing. I've got some spray paint and propane? I don't think that spray paint is aerosol. Oh. It's fine. We'll make it work. We're like, super crazy fucked, aren't we? My house was built to withstand them for the night. But this place is a far cry from a fortress. There are three entrances. Front, side, and rear. All of which open into either a parking lot or miles of forestry. So... Won't know until the morning. Do we have a plan? Okay. listen up. Step one, barricade everything. Step two is straight tower defense. Scruffy and Babs, you guys take the front. There's no windows, so they're gonna bottleneck through this door. Light the fuckers up with whatever you've got. Keep them immobilized with range tools. And please don't burn the place down. Babs? Will that do any good? It won't kill 'em, but it'll slow 'em down. All right, Rambo, you and I are gonna take the back. It's the least defended and most exposed, so we're gonna get the most attention from them. I'll keep them off of you as long as I can, but sooner or later, they are gonna break through and we're gonna have to fall back. Got it. Glitter, I need you to take the side door. Do you think you can handle it on your own? I'm a big girl. Last resort. One shot, point and click. If we get over taken, shoot center mass in any direction and try to push your way through, okay? Got it. Danny would have liked you. You're a lot like him. I mean, before... No, I never met your brother. But that's probably the biggest compliment I could ever get. Thanks. Time to go. Quietest town in West Virginia. (Latin) You ready for this? Are you? Fair point, stupid question. Hey, Mike? Yeah. If we survive tonight, we should have sex. Yeah. Sure. Okay, sounds good. Cool. Mind if I ask you a question? Is now really the best time for a "Q and A"? I'm under the assumption that this is the only time. What? Why did you save us? I needed you alive. I'm just one girl, I can't do everything by myself. You sure that's the only reason? What other reason do I need? I don't know. Guess I was just curious. Here we go. You can do that? Yeah, it's basic self-defense, man. Look out! I don't think that's gonna hold. Keep the light on them, I'll keep them off of you. Faster, damn it! Look, you wanna trade jobs? What the hell did I just shoot? Yeah! Shit. Shit. Aj, fall back. Well, hey, guys. How'd you do? Fuck! (Latin) Last magazine left. Flares, how many of those we have left? Just burned the last one I still have my shot. Save it. Well, for what it's worth, you all did pretty well for yourselves. Pretty well? Fuck you. I tore shit up out there today. Take out as many as you can. (Latin) (Latin) We made it. We made it! We survived! You know what that makes us? Fucking heroes. Eryn, get your ass over here and get in this.. You'd shoot your own brother? You're not my brother. (Latin) Eryn? Eryn, come on. I'm okay... I'm okay. Hey, Eryn. Come on. Come on. I'm okay. I'm okay, Mikey. I'm okay. Eryn? Hey, I'm your sister, would I lie to you? Eryn? Eryn? Eryn! Well, this is it. If you need anything, I mean anything, pick up the phone and you call me. You got it? All right, man. You too. Better in pairs than as a group of four. But I still think we're safer individually. We can't go home. We may never be able to see our families or our loved ones again. You might be right about travelling individually, but I think we need each other right now. You too. Ready? Yeah. Hey. Thank you. For everything. We're alive because of you. Tell me something, why did you save us? I already told you. I needed you alive. Right. That's what you said, but that's not why you really did it. Why does this even matter? Humor me. I guess... Because it's what Danny would have wanted me to do. You're smiling? What is there to be happy about right now? The darkness hasn't won yet. (Latin) Darkness comes.
