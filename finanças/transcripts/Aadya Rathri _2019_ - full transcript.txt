Kumaran, you're being too miserly here. If I say any further, I'll.... - Master, talk to her, please. This Tresyamma has been doing this job for 30 years now. I have conducted around 200 weddings as well. In many ways! But this is the first time something so cheap has happened. This wedding was not fixed yesterday or today, right? But now, it's like you're searching for a ground when you feel like shitting! Tresyamma has a point, President. My dear Tresyamma, if a girl's wedding doesn't happen in the name of dowry, it's the people here who are disgraced. Dowry? Manoharetta! Chetta, move it fast. - Where were you, Kunjatta? I've been waiting for so long. Here. I'll give now. Hey! Didn't you hear that old hag shouting over there? Ask her to get lost! Dude, you...! Fish! Brewed fish! It's a great cure for bronchitis! Come here. - What is it? Please. Nuisance! Hold this. Okay! Why did you call me? I've been wanting to say something to you for many days now, Anila dear. Don't you have any shame, Satheeshetta? On the wedding eve of the girl you were going after, you're trying the same tricks on her younger sister? Well, I had a different approach towards Anitha. Oh no! - Are you going? Stop, Anitha. I mean, Anila. Listen to me. Continue, Satheeshan. Say it... Don't be afraid. Her elder brother is asking, right? Say it! - I don't have anything to say! I'm getting tensed seeing all this. - Watch & learn! It's your wedding next month, right? Welcome! There's your father. Welcome! Welcome! Look who's standing here proudly! - Come here. Hey! I'll have a couple of drinks today. Just 2 drinks! - That's all! You rascal! I know what your intentions are! For now, the bride's brother should stand here & welcome the guests. Where are you going, dad? - Let me go have a couple of drinks! Aren't you my sweetheart? - Okay! Go! Let this be an auspicious start! Cheers! Where did she go? Won't you come early tomorrow? The auspicious time is at 8.30 AM. I'll come. - Let's go together. Shalini! Don't you have a petromax lamp? - During the wedding eve! Go and check the fuse! Isn't it dark? Shall I check after the power is back? - Go & check, I say! You'll drive me crazy! Josetta, will you sort it anytime soon? I'll sort it out right away! - You needn't keep saying it. 1... 2... 3... - Phew! Thank God! Okay, Chetta. - Bye, Chetta. Manoharan, is there anything left at home? This Josettan is too much! Kunjatta... Dude... There is some problem. Master... Look. What is it, Master? She's gone! Without telling anyone, Anitha left. How can we stand idle, Master! Shouldn't we bring her back? Come, Master. No! You should be here. Master, she will listen to me. Manoharan! You should stay here. Leave me, Master. Son... It's not just one person who's gone! It's two people! - Dad!! Dad! Get up, dad! Dad! Open your eyes, dad! Dad! Open your eyes, dad! 'May the eyes not turn moist' 'May the mind not falter' 'Don't be weak even for a moment, O dear flower' 'Up in the sky, beyond the clouds' 'As a symbol of mercy' 'There is the light of the moon shining bright for you, always with you' 'While you close your eyes daily' 'I shall sing as the breeze of the country roads' 'I'll caress you as the finger of sun rays, to wake you up in the morning' Master... We have a marquee and chairs here already, right? Master... This wasn't supposed to end this way! Ask those who went in search of her, to come back, Master. No one has to come back here now. Son... 'When your feet burn on the path of fire, I'll shower as a rain upon you from my heart' 'I shall awaken within you, as hundred wings' 'To cross the distances of time' 'I shall be the food in your hands' 'To feed the little dove, on her lips' 'I shall be the shadow of your life, without moving away even for a second' 'Continue the journey of your life, rise up as much you dreamt' It's difficult to leave this house with this girl, one fine morning... But I'm helpless, Manoharan. One month. I can't extend it any further, son. Ikka, some more time? - I'm helpless, dear. I'll pay some money for the time being and handle Ithakka. You go ahead. - Okay, Master. 'I shall wait for you at this courtyard, for you to perform rituals of my death anniversary' 'I shall write lessons with the font of love' 'In each chapter of life' 'To hold on to while you fall down' 'As a pillar of memories at the edge of the verandah' 'I shall be the shadow of your life, without moving away even for a second' 'Continue the journey of your life, rise up as much you dreamt' 'O lovely cloud, Shyama... Come to me, with your message of love' Some people here are throwing so much attitude, ever since their wedding got fixed. Don't act so tough, Shyama. The boat will topple. And, if you have any doubts about marriage, just ask this Satheeshettan. I'll clear everything. Go and clear it for your wife, you rascal! Girls look really beautiful when they are angry! Oh no! He seems to be quite angry! I think the weather would turn quite bad! Would there be rain and thunder? There won't be rain, but thunder is confirmed! Chetta, can you take me to a different bank? Wherever I take you, you'll get what you deserve! He is coming. Don't let him get away. Let him get down. Don't jump! If you jump, I'll come swimming & catch you! Come here! Should I? Manoharan! You're angry that I didn't visit you after your dad died, right? Leave me. - Don't say anything. Let's have a tea. Take your hands off! - Come with me! What's the point saying that it's the famous Madayimattam house? If the girl is wayward, it's done for, right? It's been a while since both of them have been going around in Aleppey. Everything that had to happen has already happened. That's what I heard. You hag! If you speak any further, I'll chop off your tongue! Whom are you trying to scare? It's the family which should stop the girl from going wayward. You have a younger sister, right? Who knows who all she would go with? - You hag! I'll... - No, Manoharetta! Leave him! Let me see what he will do! If you want to see how weddings of girls from good families are conducted, come for Sukumaran's daughter's wedding next week. I'll save a plate for you! To hog and go! - Leave me! Whom are you staring at? Get lost! You bloody hag! Aren't you done yet? - Yes. You go ahead. - Aren't you coming? No. You go and give it. Hi ladies! Chechi! Move away! Manoharetta, there's a big problem. This wedding won't happen. What is it? - The bride has Saturn's curse in her horoscope. Sukumarettan fixed the wedding, hiding that fact. Knowing that, the groom's family and villagers have come here. You could have mentioned it to them, Sukumaretta. But now... Manoharan... During the match making, I had told everything privately to the groom. He said he doesn't have any problem! What more can I do, son? Come. We'll sort it out. Master... I'll tell you one solution. I've spoken to them & arrived at a compromise. - What is it? Well, if you're ready to make some more offers regarding the dowry, this wedding will happen on time, as promised. Otherwise? - How can you say this at this last moment, Tresyamma? I borrowed money from everywhere I could, and sold everything I had, to conduct this wedding. What's remaining is this house, and 10 cents of land. Then you can write it in the groom's name, right? So, shall I give them your word? Where will I go with my wife, and my two younger daughters? Then you sit here, hugging your house! Let her and her younger sisters remain unmarried, and talk about their poverty to each other, for their whole lives. Tresyamma, how can you talk like this? People are listening! - Let them listen! Master, I just told him the only solution left. That's awesome! 15 sovereigns and now the house and the land around! You've won a bumper, Tresyamma! Well, when the dowry is increased, your commission would also increase, right? We need a treat! - Who invited you here? Didn't you invite me here, specially? To hog and go! And, for the information of the guests who've come, We don't have any girls here, whose curses will be cured if we pay more dowry, to be married away from this village! Who are you to say that? Just because you're sad that your sister eloped with someone, are you trying to stop others' weddings? We'll decide what will happen here. What if we're not getting the girl married to him? - Manoharan! Calm down, Sukumaretta. You said everything to that schmuck who's going to marry her, and he agreed to everything, right? Then what's the problem? So the groom is also involved in this? Or let them say that's not true. It's not the groom who takes decisions, back in our town. It is the elders in his family. We're not getting our girl married to such a wimp! If you're so smart, you bring a groom! What? Cat caught your tongue? Bring a smart guy who'll marry a girl with the Saturn's curse. If you can't, stop blabbering and get lost! There's a daring young man in this town man, who will marry her without taking a single penny as dowry! You want to see him? Master... Satheeshan! Bro, I won't do it again. - Don't be scared. Come, Satheeshan. Come, walk. Walk, Satheeshan! Lalithechi? - Yes. You don't have any objections to this marriage, right? Well... Marriage? Whose marriage? Your marriage! - Get lost, Manoharan! Marriage, it seems! I want to see how you'll get him married without his consent. You don't agree to marry this girl, right? - No way! I agree. - He has agreed. Really? - She has Saturn's curse! It's just a horoscope issue, and not an ill repute, right? Get me married! 'Dance, O' snake' 'Dance, O' snake' I realized only now that the Saturn’s curse is true. Shut up, man! 'Satheeshan, tie the wedding necklace on her neck!' I didn't think twice. Why? Who said it? Manoharan! My very own Manoharettan! Bro, have a drink! It's my first night, right? I will sleep off! It was better to trade this house & land instead! He will sell all of it very soon! Watch out! Manoharan, keep this. - What is this, Sukumaretta? This is for my happiness. - I didn't do it for money. Son, if a girl child is born, her father will sleep peacefully, only on the day he can trust that she was married to a good guy. Sukumaran will sleep peacefully tonight. - For the last time. Master, you were here? Everything is ready there! Come on! This guy! This? - They were going to buy a coffin with this, right? Keep it. Go! Go! Go! Bro, one more drink! - No! Get going! Go outside and drink! - What is this, man? Is he going to wrestle or what? Manoharetta... Such a disaster! Manoharetta, Shyama chechi is calling you. Might be to thank you. Go, Manoharetta. You needn't thank me... - Really, Manoharetta... You'll be seeing my dead body tomorrow! Shyama, I did it for your good! Here's the milk, dear. Go give it to him. Good night! 'First Night' With that night, Manoharan changed the destiny of Mullakkara village forever. Manoharan became the synonym for weddings to them. Mullakkara's very own Manoharettan. The youngsters of the village shortened his beautiful name, Madayimattam Manoharan, to Ma-Ma. For the past 22 years, Manoharettan has been conducting marriages, of all the girls who didn't elope, have a love marriage or never even fell in love. A wedding day at Mullakkara, after all the changes it went through. I told him so many times... He has come with a stupid bouquet! - We're all ready. We will leave now. Oh God! You aren't ready yet? Why are you sitting here like this? Calm down, girl. - I'm not coming. Wear that dress, at least. It's time to go to the Church. Don't think I'll come for the wedding holding this stupid bouquet! You can go and marry if you want to, aunty! For that, your uncle has to die. Look at this, aunty. I just asked to buy one like this, right? That's Priyanka Chopra's bouquet. Do you know how much it costs? I don't want to know anything. I need this bouquet! That's a must! These girls... Hey Maria! You're still putting make-up here? Your daughter is still not ready. You know that? Apply that as well, boy. This woman! Hey! It's time to leave to the Church. Look at that face, trying to get make up on! Hey! Both the bride and her mother are not ready yet! The boat to the Church hasn't come either. And you, her uncle, is standing here, looking at the sky? All that will happen. I'm wondering what to do about this. But still.. - Aunty, you calm down. If it is Manoharettan who's handling this wedding, everything will happen right on time. - I hope so. Father... It was you? After taking up all the work, where did Manoharan go? My dear Chetta, there are not just 1 or 2 weddings today. There are three! And there is only one Manoharettan! Come, Father Siby. Let's sit inside. Hey! Where are you going? Come here. Had I known Hindi, I'd have killed you! Hey! Don't do a job which you don't know. Which is the coconut tree? That one. All this should have been done earlier, Johnnykkutty. Climbing coconut trees on the morning of the wedding day? Namaste. Hey! This is the blouse you gave to Molly Chechi for stitching. Here are your jasmine flowers, aunty. Lisa, dear... - Wow. - Here's the bouquet. Get ready quickly! - But where's the beautician? He didn't come yet? Oh my God! You...!! When a new movie that's supposed to release today is waiting there, you're polishing this old print? Go! All of you get ready, please! Josetta, call the bride. Call her. - Oh no! Sister, I can't find her here. Oh no! My daughter is gone! God! My daughter is missing! Aunty, keep quiet. She would be here. Let me see. Where did this girl go? Smile. - Like this? A little more. - Hey! Oh my God! Get in, Chechi. Get in, kids. We're running late! Get in! Kunjatta, where is Manoharan? Manoharettan is here. Manoharetta! - Everything is okay, right? All okay! - Lift me up. Me! Won't you park the boat & come fast? It's time for the wedding. - Manoharetta! What is it? Manoharetta, the wedding won't happen, it seems. This is not the first time, right? Tell me the matter. That Father Murikken is really angry. It's the Father, right? - Yes. I don't have anything more to say, Kuriakose! If they are so adamant, let them get married at some other Church! But they should find some other Church to be buried at! How can you say so at this last moment, Father? When I asked her to say the prayer two weeks back, she sent the prayer on WhatsApp. Then why don't we do the wedding, Holy Communion and everything else on WhatsApp? WhatsApp expert, it seems! So it's not fair to blame Father. But Father... - No way! No way! No way! No way! If there is a man who's daring enough to defy me and conduct this marriage, in this Mullakkara, I'd like to see him! I'll show you! Please move. Manoharan, don't interfere in Church matters. This is your problem, Vicar. You get too emotional for silly matters. Manoharan! - I'm not interfering! The Changanassery Diocese can intervene, right? If the Bishop has said so from the Diocese, there's nothing else to think about. The Diocese is more important than everything else, right? Wedding is at 11.30 AM. Don't forget to wear your vestment. Father has agreed. - All of you, go to the Church. Aren't you happy now? You're happy, right? - Of course. Really happy! So relieved now. Manoharetta! You are quite something! Are there any priests who won't fall for the Diocese? Playing with us? Come on! - So that's what you gave in the cover? 'It's the rainbow of Onam' 'The sparrow is dressed up with gold, beautifully' 'It's the rainbow of Onam' 'The sparrow is dressed up with gold, beautifully' 'Showering abundant love' 'The red sky is blooming, this moment' 'O Kingfisher, sitting on an unseen branch' 'Didn't you see the flock of ducks?' 'Didn't anyone see? Didn't anyone show you?' 'Someone said that, they have gone the wrong way' So it's a girl child for Gopiyettan's daughter? 'O golden girl' 'Your tender teenage is swinging by' 'O golden girl' 'Your tender teenage is swinging by' 'Who's going in front, on that sweet boat?' 'On a boat made of leaves and flowers, who is it?' 'O Kingfisher, sitting on an unseen branch' 'Didn't you see the flock of ducks?' 'Didn't anyone see? Didn't anyone show you?' 'Someone said that, they have gone the wrong way' [Water Ambulance, donated by Puthenpuraykkal Kunjumon] 'On the field, under the scorching sun' 'When the Mynah bird is singing with a broken heart' 'On the field, under the scorching sun' 'When the Mynah bird is singing with a broken heart' 'Are the fish rushing to this shore or that shore?' 'Is the grass greener on that shore, or this shore?' 'O Kingfisher, sitting on an unseen branch' 'Didn't you see the flock of ducks?' 'Didn't anyone see? Didn't anyone show you?' 'Someone said that, they have gone the wrong way' 'It's the rainbow of Onam' 'The sparrow is dressed up with gold, beautifully' 'Showering abundant love' 'The red sky is blooming, this moment' 'O Kingfisher, sitting on an unseen branch' 'Didn't you see the flock of ducks?' 'Didn't anyone see? Didn't anyone show you?' 'Someone said that, they have gone the wrong way' 'O Kingfisher, sitting on an unseen branch' 'Didn't you see the flock of ducks?' 'Didn't anyone see? Didn't anyone show you?' 'Someone said that, they have gone the wrong way' The reason why Mullakkara loved Manoharan so fondly, was one person. No. It was the change of one person. Not anyone else. But our very own Satheeshan. Will someone change so much just by getting married? As the family and villagers stood watching, Manoharettan called out... Satheeshan! I asked him, 'What's the matter, Manoharetta?' 'Marry her', he said! I didn't take even a moment to decide, after that. Why? What's the reason? Who told it to me? Who? Manoharan! My very own Manoharettan! Do I need your 2.5 kilos of bragging while buying half a kilo of sugar? What? I buy stuff from here, suffering your bragging, because there are no other grocery stories in this village. If you go on like this, I'll go to the other shore & buy stuff! Hold this. The story is not over yet. Listen! Can't suffer your bragging anymore. - Don't you want the balance? No. I'll take it later. What do you want? - Half kilo onions, 100 grams of sesame seeds. No bragging, please. Oh no! Run away! Oh god! Satheeshan, give me a pen. - You? Wait at the back. - You better give me a pen. Can't you see people waiting? Go! Add it to my tab! - Stop! Naughty brat! You didn't give me an answer yet. I am scared. What if Manoharettan comes to know? - Ask him to get lost. Bloody Manoharettan! He's a monster who doesn't know the value of relationships! Monster! Everything I want to say, is in this! Run away! The Mama & his assistant are coming! [Ashwathi Tutorial] - Oh my God! Run! He reached? Isn't that Sarasa chechi's daughter? - Yes. He died? He didn't die. He got the first A+ grade in this village. There's a grand welcome party for him in the evening. Are we invited? - No. Scoundrel! Manoharetta! - Where are you going? Have some tea & go. - Tea? Go, run your shop! He wants to get me tea! - It's out of love. He cares so much for me! Shall we tear it in the night? - What? The flex board. Him and his damn A+. Didn't you say that the kids are all shady? See if there's any problem now! Would anyone go to sea, if a Tsunami is coming? I liked that! Hey! If Master has asked me to run this tutorial, I know how to run it with discipline, beautifully. I know that. Where did this come from? Is it a letter bomb? My dearest Smitha, your thoughts create waves in my heart. If Puthenthode is for the Vattakkayal lake, Smitha is for Ashwin. Such disciplined kids! Turn it off! The sovereignty of the king... The supremacy of the nobility, and the privileges of the Catholic priesthood. The French Revolution was an 18th century (1789–1799) political and social revolt that transformed the French system of enlightenment based on the above mentioned. The trial and execution of the king was a critical event in the revolution Say it! Say it again! If Puthenthode is for Vattakkayal? Say it! Will you write so again? - Enough, Kunjatta. If you both do such mischief again... Get lost! You too! - Phew! Saved! Don't go! You go with her, Master. Come. - Leave my hand, Master. - What is this, Teacher? Are you teaching the kids here to shoot? What can I do? Those kids are mischievous! And Manoharetta.... My salary? Is that the big deal here? To get me tensed in vain and spoil my mood! Do you know how many teachers run their families without salary? Right? - Of course. Sreemathi teacher... Shashikala teacher... Shylaja teacher... Deepa teacher... Shyamala teacher.. - I don't know about that. The one who can realize the development dreams of Mullakkara village, the pride of our village, Puthenpuraykkal Kunjumon sir presents, with world class facilities, the first houseboat service in India with a swimming pool, is being launched... Swimming pool? Water must have filled up due to a hole in the boat. Swimming pool, it seems! But Kunjumon's growth is something else! He was a kid who used to run around here, wearing shorts. He went to the Middle East and made money! Why say more? He's the 'King of the lake' in this village, right? When is he getting married? - Tomorrow! Tomorrow! Tomorrow! Tomorrow? His wedding? Not wedding! Kerala Fortune Lottery results will be out tomorrow. And... Kunjumon's wedding! No one has to dream about it. I'll conduct that wedding. Right, Ambrose? Of course. - What about Manoharan then? Yeah right! Manoharan! It's not like the alliances he brings from this locality! - Then? This Tresyamma has already found out a great alliance for Kunjumon. He just has to give his approval... Then, this Tresyamma will conduct it. The biggest wedding of this village. With that, Manoharan will be out of work! Move! Sit here. Enough of your reading! You don't have an exam tomorrow, right? Manoharan.... I heard that Father Murikken gave you trouble during Mamoottil Antony's daughter's wedding? Finally, you sorted it by getting a letter from the Changanassery Diocese, right? You have influence at the Diocese too, huh? Diocese? - Yes. Manoharettan even tried to call Vatican! Then? - He didn't have balance talk time on his phone. Vatican, it seems! One who hasn't seen Vagathanam is going to call Vatican? Get lost! Anyway, the wedding was awesome. Does that need to be said out loud, Josetta? Ever since some people have gone out of field, which wedding that Mullakkara Manoharettan conducted has been bad? Tell me! Hey! Get two cups of tea, with a lot of froth! Some people here like it that way! Lottery ban, under the consideration of the Government. - Is it? Some people would be in trouble, Chetta. Manoharetta, don't mock someone on their face like this. After all, we need to show some respect to people who're so old, right? Stop it! Enough! What? - Enough. - Let him say it, Ambrose. He's the darling here, right? The MaMa of the villagers! You hag! Just sit idle at some place! If you say something about my Manoharettan, I'll break your back! - Do it, then! Try hitting her! - What will you do? Satheeshan, calm down. After all, isn't he a token of remembrance of the last wedding that she conducted? Let him sit there. - Hey! No! No! Though my wife eloped with someone, he is taking real good care of her. And it's my personal life! Don't try to mess with that! It's okay, Ambrose. She will find a good girl for you! By the way, did she have a kid yet? - Yes. Two kids. - Pillai Chetta, here's the money. Move your tummy! With the change, buy a lottery ticket & tear it off! You can't buy it once it's banned, right? Manoharetta, you go ahead. I will be here. Go to your shop! Don't laugh too much! It's out of his love for me. - Hey! Hey! Get lost! - I'll get back at you later! Love, it seems! Not here! I'll break both your legs! I'm fed up with you guys! Not us! Started in the morning itself! I'll bash both of you up! Started shouting in the morning itself? Go inside & play! Go! Why are you looking at me like this? Manoharetta, if it goes on like this, I'll kill myself. I'll kill myself for sure. - Tell me the matter. The elder one is old enough to be married. When someone comes for an alliance with her, if they ask for her mother, we'd have to say that she has just given birth! Two Dosas... - What? Well, Dosa... Here. Here's the chutney. My dear Shyama, please stop crying! Isn't he taking real good care of you & kids? Isn't he running the shop well? Isn't he taking care of your parents too? Then what? How can I ask a husband not to love his own wife? Oh no! Ask him not to love me like this. - Like what? Like this. Then I'll have to ask him to keep the shop open at night too. Or, shall we get goons to hit him, and get him paralyzed below his hip? Hey! - Only if you want it. - He won't be paralyzed so easily. In a way, you can be happy, right? He changed his old habits, and he never looks at any other woman now, right? Don't worry. - To be worried, there's someone else here. A naughty brat who has inherited her dad's old character. I don't know what's going to happen to her! Don't worry about unnecessary things! It will happen when it's time. Or this Manoharan will make it happen. You go and rest for now. Rest? I actually have to rest for all 365 days now. Unnecessary hurdles! How many months pregnant are you now? - Eight! Mom, get me a glass of water! Come and get it if you want. You're in 10th grade now, right? Won't study a thing, and watching TV all the time! Turn it off and go and study, Meenu! I'm fed up of you, mom! Won't even let me watch a movie! This Mini hasn't gone wayward! Please forget everything, and accept me back. Mama (Uncle), didn't you buy chocolates? Mama? I've told you a 100 times not to call me Mama! What else will she call her only uncle, Manoharetta? Either Manoharetta, like everyone calls me... Or Manoharan uncle. Understood? What's happening? - What? Will anyone pass from the tutorial this time? They might. - They should! I'll get that done. - For the time being, you needn't teach her. Master was looking for you today. Kunjatta told me. So, once we elope and come back, the families would get us married quickly, is it? Hey you!! You're in front of this, all the time? All the time, watching this Kunchacko Boban? He's the one who misleads girls! Hey! When it's evening, go read some book! Or I'll burn all of this, and rip it apart. Understood? Shall I get you some porridge, Manoharetta? You shall. I've heard this somewhere! Manoharan! What's happening with Rameshan's daughter's alliance? The groom has to come from Dubai, to fix it! Chechi, is it enough if you fetch water like this? Don't you want to get married again? Go say that to your aunty! - What are you doing here? Go to your class! - Yeah right! Class, it seems! Let her be here, Manoharan. I don't even get to see you these days. My dear teacher, match making, betrothals, weddings, naming ceremonies, ear-piercing ceremonies... I need to find time in between all this, right? You're only bothered about other people. Do you remember how old you are? Thirty... - 47. Can't you tell him about it, Kunjatta? So there's no one to talk about me! I am like Mullaperiyar dam in the rainy season! Can't say when I would explode! Finally, after exploding, don't blame Mani Aasan for it. - Get lost. Manoharettan won't get commission for his own wedding, right? Manoharetta, if you had married at a young age, you would have had a good daughter like me now! That's why I'm not getting married. Understood? Where were you? - Here he is. Who's this? Unniyarcha? Hey! I've told you a thousand times... .. not to come to the kitchen, wearing this dress. There's a girl of marriageable age here. Yeah right! - Really? I'm ready to get married? - Not like that. She must have meant that you need to be tied up somewhere! I never get to see you these days. - Yes. Who else takes care of the tutorial, fields and farms? Your dad Kumaran! Don't get me talking! Come. Come here. Swearing at my dad? - Cutting lentil fruit? No. I'm making tea. Did you want to meet me urgently, to make me apply oil like this? Get lost! Achu had called from Bangalore. She calls daily, right? I had brought so many proposals for her! Then she would say that she has to finish her studies! Then how can I? - Then.... Now we can proceed confidently. Her course will get over this week. Is it? When I said that her studies is about to be completed, look at his excitement! Hey! She's just finishing her studies. But before that, we should find a good groom. My dear Master! What did you think? I'll get a first class groom for her. Kunjatta! - Kunjatta? This guy? Give it. Oil, right? - Moron. Get the diary! Look at this. This is a list of first class grooms, I've personally found for her. See! Look! Do you want a doctor, or an engineer? Or a businessman? Look! - Where? Let me see. - Look. Just check it and tell me which one you want! Not you. Her. - Tell him. - You tell him. You tell him. - You tell him. Tell me! Well, Manoharan.... We'd like it to be a good groom from this town itself... Yes. We don't have anyone else, Manoharan. That's why... The horse in Sharapanjaram (movie) will have more gratitude. Wasted my time! - Hey! Manoharan, I asked only for this small thing, right? Rest everything you can do as you wish! If so, we should get her married to someone who's ready to stay here after marriage, right? Of course! You know how many losers are there in our list, ready to stay in the wife's house? Give it here. Look! It's clear from his face, that he's ready to stay at the wife's house. Where? Let me see. - His name is Sachi, from Kochi. Sheesh! This one? Sheesh! We don't need such schmucks! A fine young man from this village itself. Are there any fine young men in this village? Whoever it is, we are okay, if Manoharan approves. Such a guy? My dear people! The one who can realize the development dreams of our Mullakkara village, the pride of our village, Puthenpuraykkal Kunjumon sir presents, with world class facilities... Like he said, that's a good proposal! I've taught him 4 times in 3rd grade. I've taught him twice in 6th grade. Total - 12. So it's plus two! Sheesh! But he's not at all tall. Get lost! Height doesn't matter. He is good looking! It's not about the height, Master. Is it about the length then? Must be about the weight then! We don't need that. - Why? Though he's rich, he has only studied till 10th grade! Would that be enough for our Achu? Hey! When his father died, I know how the situation of their family was. With this 10th grade education, if he can earn so much... he is really smart! Extremely smart! But still, Master... Do we really need it? Anyway, you go there and do an inquiry. We can know how the situation is, right? - Yes. Am I hearing the truth, Manoharan? What's your opinion, Kamalechi? Do you even have to ask, Manoharan? I agree not just 100, but 200%. 100 is fine! Did Teacher & Master say anything? Leave all that to us, Chechi. If you agree, we'll take care of the rest. Right? Of course, I agree. I'm ready to host the wedding even tomorrow. Not tomorrow. - But... Shouldn't we ask him once? That's what. Where is Kunjumon? His look is fine, right? Has he gone a bit overboard? No! Slightly... It's not like you said. The price is a little high. And it needs work too. Okay then! As we agreed upon! What's up, Kunjumon? Looks like you've fixed a deal? How many boats do you have now? - This is the fifth. The price is a bit high. But if I renovate it, it will be awesome. Those 4 running ones are not enough during the tourist season. I heard that you solved the land encroachment case of the resort, by paying bribes! That's why the people here call my boss 'King of the lake'. Sudhi... - Let him praise you! What's happening then? There's a small news for you. You didn't say anything about the marriage. Did you have food, Manoharettan? That time is over, right? It's only 2 PM, right? I mean, did you have lunch? I'll have it. You didn't say anything about what I told you. Manoharetta... I have some dreams. To reach those dreams, I will go to any end. Don't go further to the end. You'll fall into the lake. Sudhi! Or no need. Not just this marriage... I'm not ready for any marriage, right now. Business! Business is the only thing on my mind now. - Correct! I want to grow. Across this lake, there's a world that you haven't seen! I want to grow and blossom there too. You may grow! But isn't it good to have someone with you, to pour water & add manure? It's not that, Manoharetta. A wedding in between all this rush? There will be some rush for the wedding feast. But we'll see to it that there's no rush at the Mandapam. And this wedding is only for one day, right? You can grow, on the rest of the days! I can... Mom! What is this, Manoharetta? You won't even let someone grow? Even otherwise, he's not fully grown yet. - Shut up! Yes, son. She's a really nice girl. I have seen her. Sharada Teacher & Master's grand-daughter. Agree to it! - Yes! Whenever it is, you need to get married, right Kunjumon? And this is a girl from our village, and a great family too. Even your mom approves! Just nod your head, and I'll take care of the rest! Agree to it, son! When all of you are saying so much, what do I say? So, as we agreed upon! Then I'll talk to Master, and make arrangements for them to visit you. Just let us know. Shall I leave then? Where? Yes. I forgot that it's a boat. There are 4 acres beyond this. And more on this side. - A total of 10-12 acres. Good morning, sir. - Good morning. Why did you get late? Well, we... - Come, come. Let's go inside. Come. Let's go inside. The construction of an 8000 sq. ft. house is going on, at the adjacent property. He saw this house in some Tamil movie, liked it & bought it for a big price! Which was that movie? 'Vinnaithaandi Varuvaaya'. - Yes. Ever since he saw 'Titanic', he really wanted to buy a ship like that. It was me who told him that the lake wasn't wide enough for that. Sudhi! I swear! Lucky that he didn't watch 'Jurassic Park'. We're thinking of a date after the construction of the new house is over. What is it, Master? If so, shall we fix it before the coming 'Karkidakam' month? What say, Manoharan? Well... Master, one minute. Come. Where are they going? - Show them around the house. Teacher, let me show you around the house. Come. - They're also going? Come here. Everyone is leaving? What happened? Is the Jilebi (sweet) not good? How can you alone decide about the wedding? Any problem? What about the other stuff? - Is it about the feast? No! Seeing the bride! You can see her always after the wedding, right? Then don't say that you've had enough! Isn't there a ceremony like that, before the wedding? It's my only wedding, right? Understood. You can meet Achu the day after she comes from Bangalore. Sure? - Sure! Two years? What are you saying, Master? What can I do? She had called this morning. She wants to join for a PG course, it seems. She said she cleared the entrance, and that the classes will begin next week. That's all? I got really scared. She can continue her studies even after marriage, right? He's not a guy who'll have a problem with that. Let the ceremony happen now. Hey! You just talk to her over the phone. This has to be discussed in person, to sort it out. Her exams will get over tomorrow anyway, right? I'll go there myself and bring her. I'll go in person, make her understand everything, and bring her! She will understand when I say it. Don't worry, Master. Let the ceremony happen for now. Okay. - Come. So, everything as we agreed upon! The wedding between them has been fixed on an auspicious day, next month. So, let everything be beautiful! So be it. - One selfie, please. Am I there in it? And your last hope is also gone! It is Manoharan who's conducting Kunjumon's marriage. That too, with Master's granddaughter. Can a bigger wedding happen in this village? You are done for, Tresyamma! Don't say that! She has lottery with her, right? What if she wins it? Or if you really work hard, you can get this Ambrose married! I'm only destined to raise the cattle. Someone else is drinking the milk! Enough! Don't show off too much! The sun is not going to rise in the west, with this one night, right? Let's see! Hey! Did you know? Our Mama & Kunjatta are leaving. - Where to? To Bangalore. Remember everything I told you? Give Nanuettan the money for painting, and for cleaning the fields. And pay the advance for the wedding feast as well. I'll do all that. You go without any worry! I'm not worried at all. But when I come back after 2 days, all this should be done. Don't worry. I'll do everything. Then... Just because I'm not here, never allow the boys and girls here to mingle! Hey! After snatching away everything else, you've snatched this big one too? Remember one thing! As long as this Tresyamma is alive, this wedding won't happen. I won't let it happen! From here on, I'm re-writing your horoscope! You started writing horoscopes now? Chedathi, it's been 22 years since I started this job, and since you stopped it. So, mark your calendar. If I have given the word, on the date and time agreed upon, this Manoharan will conduct their wedding... - beautifully! Let's see! - Let's see! Awesome, Manoharetta. I can see properly now. So, see you after I come back. - Yes. Nice. Where did you steal it from? I bought it during the festival. Manoharetta... Come back soon. Go to your shop! It's out of love. - I can see that. Shall we sit inside? - No. Let 4 people see us! 4 people? Who are they? He has actually left, man! Now we'll have a blast! Yaay! Can't get through to her. Where do we search for her now? Give me her photo. Keep trying her on the phone, okay? Don't go missing! Who won't go missing here? This girl... Sorry. This girl.. Do you know her? From Alappuzha. Bhaiyya, is the science block this way? (in broken Hindi-Tamil-Kannada) You might find it. You should be able to. Sheesh! Malayalis! Crazy fellow! Monkey! Where would she be? Stop! This girl... There? Excuse me. Nothing. No? This must be her. I was just checking, man! Not this one. What is this? A mobile tower? Chechi, Achu? - What? Mullakkara... Master... Daughter? - Master? Manoharan... Kunjatta.. - Oh! Kunjatta? Okay! Come! Come! - Where are you taking me? Leave me. Don't do anything to me. Dear... This girl...? Son... Manoharetta! What look is this? Let that be. Have you come alone? No. Kunjatta has also come. Then where is he? Yeah... Where did he go? Isn't that our Kunjatta? You!! Manoharetta! Come here! (Kisses) - Has he gone crazy or what? Come! - (Kisses) Chechi, one more round. Please! No! No! Come! Okay! Come Go ahead, girl. Hug me! Is he a monk or what? To hug and give blessings? Come. Hold me tightly. Kunjatta! One minute, bro! Click it! - Bro? Kunjatta has gone out of hand, Manoharetta! Look for someone else now. These fans are too much! They weren't leaving me only! Manoharetta, I'm not coming back to that bloody village again! Kunjatta, awesome! Wear this attire back home too. Let everyone get shocked. Let that be. Look at you! You chopped off all that long hair... and you've become all skinny! Why? Awesome, right? It's your wedding in one month. Before that, eat something and become healthy! Preparations have begun there! Master & Teacher are really excited! - Yes. They're all waiting for you to come back after the exams. Manoharetta, I... I've got admission for PG here. I have a stipend too. I want to study that as well. So what? You can continue studying after marriage too, right? You can teach him as well. Right? It's not that, Manoharetta. Classes will begin the coming week. Then I'll have classes for one more year. I worked so hard to get this seat. Can't you just apply for one month's leave? I'm asking only for one more year, right? You don't have to think too much, dear. Master & I have discussed and decided everything. Okay? We'll be leaving after tomorrow's exam. I can't come, Manoharetta. Why? Any certificates are pending? Then Kunjatta will collect it and come. Right? - Yes. Hey! You don't have to think too much. Study well for tomorrow's exam. We have to leave tomorrow evening. Okay? I'll come tomorrow. I'm in love with someone. What did you say? I'm in love with someone. You should get us married. - What did you say? What are you doing? - Move away! Leave me! - No, Manoharetta! No! There are 2 people who have prepared everything and waiting for you there! Forgetting them, you want to go with some random scoundrel? Manoharetta! You should have some gratitude! It won't happen, dear! Whoever is with you.... this Manoharan won't be with you. Remember that! Come, Manoharetta! Come! I am hurt! Really hurt! Come, Manoharetta! You know Vadakkedathu Pappettan's daughter? Sujatha! She's 5.25 feet tall. Perfect weight. Good looking too. You know how beautiful she is? They're well off, even financially. Just that she's not so educated or progressive. But she's perfect to be a house-wife. Since this is not happening, shall we consider that for Kunjumon? Go say that to your ... I'm going crazy here and... Manoharetta! Aren't there any other girls in the world? Or won't there be any more weddings? You just have to put your mind into it! Kunjumon's wedding will definitely happen on the proposed date! Or we will make it happen! Leave it, Manoharetta! I can't leave it so easily, man! Each time I get a girl married, it's like I'm getting my own sister married. Do they see me just as a broker? - No. I'm their elder brother! Elder brother! Their own elder brother. That's how they have seen me. And vice versa! Except one of them. Who's that? And then? Then what? I had to conduct her wedding as well. Great! Manoharetta, you must be the only broker who got his own girlfriend married, for the first time in the world! Such was my situation then! But I'm not sad because of that. I wasn't able to save her! Shalini! Manoharan, my child! Save my child! Shalini! Shalini! When I lost my parents that day, they left me in Manoharettan's hands. However much he gets angry at me, however much he shouts at me, Manoharettan can understand me. So she's your daughter who was not born to you, right? She will obey what I say. Leaving everything or everyone else in this world, she will come with me. Wait and watch. Wait and watch! Didn't you pour water? I'm relieved! It's done finally! Come. Let's go! Okay Madam. Thank you. Here's all your luggage. Here. Come. Let's go. Shall we eat a burger? - Burger? Come on! It's time for the train. - Is it? Leave me! Please move. Bloody rascal! [speaking in Kannada] Is this a Kannada movie or what? Is this a movie shooting? - Then there should be a camera, right? Yes. Are the teachers sending goons to hit the students for getting low marks in exams? Get lost! This is not all that. Then? - That's his uncle. His wedding was fixed with a minister's daughter here. But he's in love with a girl here. They've come after knowing that. - Why? To kill her! So it's the Manoharettan of Bangalore who's rocking here. But no one is intervening! [Continues speaking in Kannada] What's wrong with him? Nice boy. Good looking, too. Good college... Marriage with a minister's daughter. And then doing unnecessary things! These guys should be... No one is reacting! - Where did she go? Yes. Where is she? Manoharetta, do something. Or it will be a problem! What can I do? He should have been thrashed by me instead of them! Not that, Manoharetta. If something happens to him, our Achu might do something drastic. Don't get me tensed! Manoharetta, this will be a problem. Listen to me! Go and compromise! How? You've compromised much bigger problems back home so easily, right? You can do it! Hey! We can go back to Kerala with our Achu, only if he is alive. Go, Manoharetta! If anyone has the courage to oppose us, come on! Hey! Wear this! We've never failed, whenever you've worn this. Go! Brother, a compromise? The moment you step out of this campus, I will kill you! Thank you. Come on! Didn't you hear him? Come on! Oh no! Don't do anything! Please don't. I have to get down. Put me down. I have high B.P. Don't topple me. My disk will slip. Put me down. You guys are in serious trouble! What? - My dear bro, you're in trouble! You should leave this place at the earliest. If their people see you, they will kill you! Who? Manoharettan! - It's true. Now all their anger would be towards Manoharettan. Are you satisfied now? Are you satisfied now? After killing the hopes of an entire family... What are you looking at? I didn't see all this when you shamelessly got beaten up like a dog! If you are a man with a spine, you should be brave enough to answer back to them! Instead, you shouldn't be getting beaten up, for romancing! I stood there and got beaten up, only because I'm a man with a spine! He's speaking in Malayalam! His mother is a Malayali. They didn't come looking for me. They came looking for the girl I'm in love with. To kill her! It's not like I don't know how to answer or hit them back. It's only because I love her so much! Enough! Enough! Don't say anything more! Talking back after ruining a girl's life? Manoharetta, no. - You shut up! I know her. She won't be disobedient. After alluring her... Let me talk, please. - Shut up! What was your intention? How did you threaten and lure her? Tell me! It was me who told him that I love him! Satya, he has come inside. Come! I'm not coming. Achu, don't be adamant. I'm not coming, Manoharetta. Achu, listen to Manoharettan now. Go! Let them kill me! But I won't come unless Manoharettan promises me that he'll stand by me. Manoharetta, agree to it! 'Beside every path, where we reach, searching each other' 'Why does the beat in my heart become fervent?' 'How many more days shall pass, away from each other?' 'O magical city' 'On your paths' 'Give us a place, to share dreams' 'Are we not able to spread smiles to each other, in every moment?' 'Are words from our hearts going back, as soon as they reach the lips?' 'Sharp pairs of eyes, on the flowers that blossomed on the paths' 'Day and night, did you hear the sound of the roaring sea, in our lives?' 'O magical city' 'On your paths' 'Give us a place, to share dreams' 'Beside every path, where we reach, searching each other' 'Why does the beat in my heart become fervent?' Come! Let's go this way! Wait. Turn to the left. - Why? Haven't they said that everything will be all right? I can't breathe! I had told you that we'll wear pants. Why? Over there! Come! Run! - I'm not able to run! Didn't I tell you that I had a slip disk? Run! We're trapped, Manoharetta. Manoharetta, come! Come! - Don't stand there staring. Come fast! Come and get in! Fast! Get in, Manoharetta. - Let's go! It's risky if you try to get out of the city now. They won't reach here anyway. This is my house. Come. Get down. Come. Come. Daddy! My kids! What's your name, dear? - Chinnu. I'll get tea for you. Which grade are you studying in? - 3rd grade. Who drew all these? Me and my sister. - Wow. Your sister is also smart, huh? Brother... Don't cry. I never expected you here, dear. Though what you did was wrong, you're living happily, right? That's enough for your brother. Mistake? I didn't do wrong, Chetta. I was the one who was wronged. You were wronged? We invited all relatives and villagers... arranged all the gold and money they asked for... When you left everything behind and went away, our father died of heartbreak! Still, we were the ones who wronged you? Tell me. I know, Chetta. The preparations were all grand! But shall I ask you one thing? The first and last word in a marriage, is the consent of the girl who's going to get married. Did you ask for my consent? Had you asked for my consent? After fixing everything, when everyone was getting ready for my wedding, at least , for once... did you feel like calling me next to you, and asking me whether I agree to it or not? We only wished the best for you, dear. The best? What's best? You arranged the gold & money they asked for, it seems. However much you pay, however much you cover her in gold, you can't put a price for a girl's consent. Hey! I was the one who was wronged, Chetta. Even after so many years, aren't you doing the same mistake, to Achu as well? Did you ask for her consent before fixing this wedding? It's her choice. It's her life. Agree to it, Chetta. It's me, Manoharan. It's heavenly here because Manoharettan is not here. I hope he doesn't come back soon. The kids are having a blast for the past 2-3 days! Let them have a blast, man! How long is this going to go on? Only until they come back! Manoharan & Kunjatta went saying they'll back the next day. But there's no news about them! However far they go, they come back the very next day! - Yes. - What distance? You're talking so much about people who've never been outside Alappuzha. What do you know? They have gone to look for the girl, to Bangalore! So what? So what? Which world are you living in? A girl who has gone to Bangalore, and a rocket sent to space are the same! Has anything come back in the shape it went? Why? - You fool! - Yes? Lasar ettan of the other shore, sent his daughter to study in Bangalore. And when he went there looking for the girl, what did he see? - What? The girl was living with a guy! Is it? - She said it, right? Ask her. And so many such stories. Don't talk nonsense, Tresya Chedathi. Then why didn't they come back, after going to look for her? They've sent the girl to study in Bangalore! Bangalore! How do you know this, Tresyamma? Where did Tresyamma Chedathi do her pre-degree? Where? It was in Bangalore! Is it? - Hey boy! Don't talk too much! Where's your Mama & assistant, who went looking for the girl? Tell me! Tell me! Tell me. Tell me. If I call you, won't you come with me? Oh no! I am scared! Whom are you scared of? Your family? Or these villagers? What if Manoharettan...? - Manoharettan! Ask him to get lost! Monster! Whatever happens, whoever locks you up, if you close your eyes once, you can hear my heartbeat. Close your eyes! Close your eyes! I can hear it! Manoharettan! Oh my God! Oh no! Why is everyone running? Why are the kids running? Did a boat sink? What happened now? Didn't I tell you? He's coming back with empty hands! She must be living with someone there. - Is it? Whatever this Tresyamma has said, has never... There's the girl. This has got nothing to do with what you said, Tresyamma! Getting run out while boasting very well, is too bad! The heart of certain hags are like charcoal! Trouble at some places, gossip at some places. Why isn't anyone speaking up? Why should we stay silent and tolerate this hag? She will have to pay a price for this bragging! A huge price! The problem is not with Bangalore or Madras! It's your mind! Can't you be good, you hag? The Collector is a nuisance now. Get him transferred somehow. Won't even let me do business peacefully. Boss! 'The brave and mighty hero, whom I've always dreamt of' 'You are the lovely, beautiful heroine, who has captured my heart' 'Searching for the shore where stars twinkle like silver fireflies' 'On a swan-boat, we would cross the seven oceans' 'With just a look, you captured the kingdom of my heart, at first sight' 'O beauty, your smiles turned this mighty king into a tame deer' 'O Goddess, come and bless my kingdom' 'Play the tunes of love, on the mystical Veena' 'I shall wear the fine cloth stitched by the full moon' 'Let's turn the sapphire towers, into a stage to dance' 'When I come, open the dream mansion, built by the sculptor of love' 'With just a look, you captured the kingdom of my heart, at first sight' 'O beauty, your smiles turned this mighty king into a tame deer' 'The brave and mighty hero, whom I've always dreamt of' 'You are the lovely, beautiful heroine, who has captured my heart' 'Searching for the shore where stars twinkle like silver fireflies' 'On a swan-boat, we would cross the seven oceans' 'With just a look, you captured the kingdom of my heart, at first sight' 'O beauty, your smiles turned this mighty king into a tame deer' Remember everything I said? You will be with me, right? I can't help it, right? Hey! No one there should suspect that you don't want to marry him. What's there to suspect in this? If he's going to marry her, people might suspect. But if he's going to marry her, there is nothing to suspect. I'm wondering which one would happen among these! Do you have any doubts? What all are you saying? - No, bro. If he marries her, he will take her to Bangalore directly. And if our guy is marrying her? There are so many facilities! A great AC office, right at the junction. Resort... Houseboats... Look at me! He even has a European commode. We just have to sit like this. You & your commode! - Oh no! Get lost! - And he has a swimming pool too! Catch it! - Swim in the pool then! Hey! Clear your doubts & come there quickly! Go there and paint it there! Get down carefully. Look who's here! Come! Come! - Master! My darling! - You look so weak, my dear Master! Why? Teacher isn't giving you any food? Give me the suitcase. Give it here. Dear, are you doing good? - Yes, Chechi. Oh my God! Didn't you erect the marquee yet, Master? Will anyone erect a marquee one month before the wedding? It's Nalappattu Narayanan Master's granddaughter's wedding! Let all the people know! Sheesh! What is this paint? You didn't like it, dear? Achutty... - Teacher... My dear... What is this attire, dear? Leave all that. Where's the gold and clothes for the wedding, Sharadamma? There's still time for all that! So you didn't buy it yet? What is this, Manoharetta? When he came and told me, I thought I'll have to come directly to the Mandapam. By the way, where is the Mandapam? We'll arrange all that. Let's build the Mandapam there. A Mandapam on a broad stage. Sharadamma, come. Let's catch up! Which is going to be my bedroom for first night? - This girl! Nice! - Master! Go & come back on Saturday! Manoharetta! - It's Kunjatta. Why are you wearing a wreath? If there was any more delay, I'd have been under a wreath now. Did you come swimming from Bangalore? Go & change your clothes. What is this? - Who knows! [Humming] Go. Go and tell him the matter. Go! Master... I can't hold on any longer. Why should you hold on? Just go ahead and pee! Not that, Master. Our Achu... She's not like we thought, Master. Of course! She shocked us, right? We suspected in vain that she won't agree to the wedding. It's not that, Master. She is old and mature enough to take a decision now, Master. No! Isn't that why we took a decision regarding her marriage? Tell him! Tell him the matter! This wedding won't happen, Master. That's what I also thought... ... until you came back from Bangalore. I became relieved only now. Tell him! Come here, Master. Careful. - Don't hold me. Don't hold me. - Sit there. Sit there. Don't talk! Listen to everything I have to say! Tell me! Here. Take this. Give it! - Have it. I tried my best to dissuade her, Master. But she's adamant about her decision. Now the only thing we can do, is to fulfill her wish. She... She is in love with a boy from Bangalore. But... Why did she do this to us, Master? Leave it. What else can I say? Forgive me for not saying it so far. Leave it. - Wait, Master. What else can I say? No. I said I'm leaving. Only I heard... Only I heard the whole thing. The one who's supposed to hear this, is lying there! Wasted money on the bottle in vain! Shall I tell this to Teacher? - Get lost! Teacher won't drink! Oh no! Is he dead? Didn't you tell me that they shouldn't suspect anything? How was my acting? One slap I'll give you! It was like a Telugu film! Is it a problem, Manoharetta? - Yes. Then I'll make it a little more realistic from tomorrow. A 'Pothettan' touch! Poth (bull) or buffalo... Whatever! Just do as I say, dear. Kunjatta and me presented this proposal to him, upon Master's request. He was not at all interested. He said decently that he is yet to grow. Didn't listen. - Who? Me! - Manoharetta! No point saying all that now. Well, you talk to him directly. Talk to him? Me? Get lost, Manoharetta! When you talk directly, present this matter subtly. He was forced into this, right? So he'll back out himself. Don't say anything, Manoharettan! I won't do it. Listen to me! - Manoharetta! Manohare... - Here! Here! - Oh! You were here? Didn't you wear this cloth yet? Why do I need this now? - You need it. Didn't you get ready, dear? They are about to reach. Who? - The groom & party. Groom & party? Didn't they say that they will come the next day after we're back from Bangalore? To whom? - To me! But you didn't tell me! - Does danger come after announcing? They are about to reach. Go & get ready, dear. Teacher... Master... Did you take bath, dear? - No. - Good. Master! Teacher... - Yes. Snacks & tea are ready, right? Didn't you eat anything yet? Not for me. They are about to reach. Who? - The groom & party! - Oh no! But there's nothing here. Shouldn't you store at least some sweets, in a prospective bride's house? Where is Master? - He is sitting there after applying oil! is he going to fight a war? What do we do now? You do one thing. Go to the market and buy something. Oh God! Where is she now? I'm wearing a T-shirt with your photo on it, boss. See! Comb your hair properly. Everyone is here. - Yes. Let boss get down first. Now everyone else can come. Oh God! There are plenty of people! Give it to me. Welcome! Welcome. - Good morning, sir. Enough! This was such a surprise visit. You could have just walked over that bridge, right? This was for some weight! Then why stop at a houseboat? Why didn't you come in a jangar? That's saved for the wedding! - Oh God! Go ahead. Go inside. Please go. Though he owns houseboats and a 2 storeyed house, and an AC office, and he's very rich now... In spite of all this, we had a doubt whether he's old or big enough to get married! Rascal... - But since Manoharan brought this proposal, She's also planning to do a PG course. That's when Manoharan told us about Kunjumon. If Manoharan recommends, I don't have to think twice. Us too. I want to.... That's all? Come. I'll be right back. - There he goes again. - They've even offered an apartment for him at Burj Khalifa if he goes back. Over here. Hey! Here? - We usually go here. Hey! I don't want to pee. - Then? I wanted in private. Go ahead. Talk! To Achu! Is that it? I mistook you. Just go up from here, and turn left. Go! Poor thing. Is this a hostel? There are so many rooms. Where is she hiding? Sorry. Why are you looking at me like this? Well... I... You? I... Are you in any kind of tension, Achu? No! I have a little bit of tension. You can... ... say something. Well... Well? There's no other eligible bachelor like you, anywhere in this village. Not on the other shore too. Yes. Not on the other shore too. Yes. A nice house, a nice family... So much money... And, handsomeness that would tempt any girl. But... shall I ask you something? Won't you get a better girl than me, Kunjettan? 14 years... Move away. For the past 14 years, ... there has been a dream in my heart. Houseboat... Tourism, real estate, business... ... and everything else I've touched, have turned into gold. You also would know that Kunjumon, like everyone else. But... There's a secret that I've been carrying in my heart. Akshay... Ajmal... Akash... Ashwathi Ramachandran... - Present, teacher! Akhil... Anuraj... Kunjumon PP? Kunjumon PP? Kunjumon PP! - Present, Teacher! When I was expelled for failing in the same class for the 3rd time, I had only one dream. A face that made a boy who was wearing half-shorts in the LP school, dream to become today's 'King of the lake'. Ashwathi Ramachandran. My Achu. Kunjetta, I... Whatever I've achieved, was for you. Whatever I'm going to achieve, is for you. The house from 'Vinnaithaandi'... ... and my Taj Mahal that I'm building for you, in 8000 sq. ft. All that is for you! Ever since I can remember, you've been in my heart! I won't let you go, for anything or anyone! I swear! I swear! I swear! Oh my God! I swear! Oh my God! So you didn't tell him? How do I tell him, Manoharetta? If I can't forget Satya, whom I've known only for 3 years, how do I tell someone who has had only me in his heart since childhood, that I love someone else? I don't know anything. Try to convince him somehow. Manoharetta! Oh no! Kunjatta, I've been waiting for so long! You're standing here? Come there. - Go! Get everything ready. Are you going to dance now? - We might have to. Have you given dates to 2 grooms for match-making today? I don't get you. - He has come here. Who? - That guy from Bangalore. 800 Crores guy. Satya! What is he doing here? - I don't know. Looks like he's coming here. What about them? - Get rid of them somehow. Or it will be a clash. Who asked you to buy so much stuff? Buying snacks is a problem now? - They should finish eating, right? You didn't eat anything, Kunjumon! Until he gets married, boss won't eat anything. Sudhi... - Please eat. Didn't work? Then please eat. Let's leave quickly before the bad time starts after the inauspicious time. Bad time? Is there a time like that? It wasn't there, but it can come anytime! Shall we leave? Come, Chetta. Are all of you leaving? You didn't eat anything! Take it in your hand. You can eat it on the way back. Chetta, the boat will leave. Go fast. - Please come. Oops! I forgot something. - Enough! You've got enough blessings. It's already too much. Bye, Manoharan. - He's a respectful guy. Phew! He came looking for you, Manoharettan. Look who's here! Where were you all this while? We were all waiting for you. Yes. - Didn't you recognize him, Master? Who is he? - No one recognized him? No. - I also don't. Didn't you recognize him? - Master... Master! - Yes. Master! Did you recognize him? He's a new Master who has to come to teach some new subjects, at our tutorial college. He's a Master? - Yes. Master? - Yeah. From his attire, I thought he's a student who came to get admission. What's your name, Master? Satya. Why don't you come inside then? - No! It's not time for that yet. We have to discuss about the salary. Right? Come, dear. Such a nice boy, right Master? Why did you come here now? Now me coming here is a problem? You left me there for them to kill me, and came here to get her married? It's not a wedding. They just had some tea. Tea? - Manoharan, have some tea. See! Tea! That's all! Then why did you say that I'm a Master? Can I make you a Principal as soon as you came? It will be fun. Come, Master. Will it be a problem? - No! Go wear a shawl and come. Why do I need a shawl now? Kids these days... Hey! What all have you studied? Will that be enough to tame those naughty guys? Master... Though the tutorial college is in my granddaughter's name, it's he who runs it. Before I finished, she is here! This is my granddaughter. Ashwathi. And a happy news... We fixed her wedding today. Slightly... Hello. - Hello! She studied in Bangalore. It was Manoharan who brought this proposal as well. Thank you very much. We had a great time. See you during the next holidays. No! No! You must come for my marriage! Your marriage? - Yeah. - Oh wow! My first and last marriage! That'd be great! Come with your family. - Definitely! Sure! Thanks a lot. See you next time. - Thank you very much. Our boss is too good. He speaks English so easily! Not just easily... Who else can speak English like our boss in this village? Get me some poison, Iago... - The foreigners haven't left? I will not expostulate with her. Lest her body and beauty... unprovide my mind this night, Iago. And Iago says, 'Do it not with poison'. 'Strangle her in her bed'. Othello says... Boss, your wedding is fixed? Aren't you going to invite us? Definitely... I won't invite you. Okay then. So that their love doesn't part ways, and that your life won't get ruined, I am informing this to you. Is this why you called me in such a hurry? Someone jealous of you might have written this! I understood who it is. Who is it? Abjud Kamshi.. - Abjud Kamshi... From his name, seems like he's a Bengali. Will a Bengali write in Malayalam? Not Abjud Kamshi. Abhyuthayakamshi (well-wisher). You don't even know to read Malayalam! The font was such! This is a tension now. For me too. What if there's some problem like it's mentioned in this letter? - That's what. Anyway, she studied in some other place, right? There might be some scratches and dents. - Yes. Sudhi, you can say anything about me. But if you say something about that poor girl? I'll drown you in this lake! Manoharetta! Though he's a loser.. - Yes! It's about a wedding, right? We can reconsider our decision, right? Manoharetta... My Achu won't do all that. I'm sure. What are you sure about? - I am sure. When I got such a letter, I wanted to let you know. That's all. Even if everyone else says whatever, you shouldn't have said so, Manoharettan! You shouldn't have! - You shouldn't have! I shouldn't have! But since it's a wedding... - Please! But before making a decision... - Manoharetta... No? - No! Okay then. Come. This is why all post offices shut down. Bloody Abjud Kamshi. - Oh my God! It's so hot. - Take it away! You shouldn't be riding this boat. You should be driving a ship! You and your ancient tricks! My dear Manoharettan, he's head over heels in love. He won't back out, with an anonymous letter. But what did I do? - So didn't you write the letter? Your dad wrote it! Dad wouldn't have written it. So you didn't write it? Not me. - Then who? - Then who? Then who? Past, present, future, love failure, humiliation... I can predict all of these! Just 100 Rupees! It's true that both of them are from this village. And we know the groom too. But should we be so progressive, that we needn't match the horoscopes, teacher? I came to know only now that the horoscopes weren't checked. That doesn't matter. Times are changing, right? After both of them meeting, talking to each other, and fixing the wedding, what's the point in checking horoscopes now? You know the fate of the liberals who built a wall, right? But still.. - Don't say anything, Teacher. I will convince Manoharettan. Then I'll come with the right guy for this. Stop. Why did you get so late? We're not coming in a car, right? Climb up. - We came on a boat, right? Shouldn't I come? - Help him up. Hey! Will it be happen? We need to stop it, not make it happen, right? Yes. - Don't worry about anything. I've taught him everything. Say it! Past, present, future. I'll sort everything out. Just 100 Rupees. - Forget the past. Whatever happens, their horoscopes shouldn't match. Just 50 Rupees. 50 Rupees, fine. Don't reduce it any further. No. Come... O Almighty! Oh no! What is it? - Tell me the truth. Did you bring me to get my horoscope torn? What is it? - Do you know who that is? Attukal Ramakrishnan. Who's that? - An expert in this subject. - Is it? He will kill me, if he sees me. - Then take the money. I don't want your money or anything. - Manoharan! Come here. - No boat? - Swim & go! Master... I don't understand how this happened. What? - In the horoscope of this girl, I can see a major curse. Oh no! What is it? The girl born on 'Purada' star sign, on a no-moon night, will not have a happy married life. Oh no! - Master! That means? It means that she will become a widow. Stop it! Stop painting! Enough! Enough! Enough! But, on the night of Pournami (full moon)... Isn't that an adult film? a male horoscope, born with the star sign 'Punartham'... will solve all the horoscope issues of this girl. Both these horoscopes match very well. Thank God! The owners of these horoscopes, have a bonding from the previous life itself. Wishing you a long and happy married life! That shouldn't be happening! Thirumeni, keep a couple of those shells on 'Shu'. Everything will be all right. - Keep quiet. Idiot. Speaking nonsense? Let that be. Who's the man who brought the groom's horoscope? Here he is. - This is the man! You are a learned man! It's written on your face! Manoharetta, have this. Who doesn't wish for happiness? But, what if we have to pay a huge price for it? When I am here, why should you worry about a price? Don't be shattered when you hear what I'm going to say. - No. Marriage is something that will happen only once in life. No! If you get divorced, it can happen again! - Sudhi! So, we should be really careful while taking that decision. But we've already taken that decision! You made me take that decision, Manoharettan. Right? - Yes. Yes. It's a proposal that I brought... So I'll tell you the truth myself. Manoharetta, no! I can't hold on any longer. Why are you holding it? Drink it! Bottoms up! Manoharetta, tell me what it is. She lost her mental balance due to the cruel ragging by the seniors... and was in Kundanahalli hospital there for two weeks. It's like Kuthiravattam here. She can turn violent any moment, when she feels more love. A peculiar disease which causes suicide tendency. Brain wrestle-mania eyedrops. When it was confirmed that it can't be cured through medicine, doctors advised to get her married to see if there would be any improvement. Her situation was so bad! It's a disease that can happen to one or two people in a million.. These eye-drops... Even her mom had these eye-drops! She was picking her tooth, after dinner, holding her child in hand. She went out to get some fresh air, jumped into the lake & committed suicide. it was Manoharettan who saved that child. Yes. Out of love for her.. and the hope that it will be cured after her wedding... I did it. But... If I don't say this to you even now, it will be the biggest mistake I'm doing to you! A proposal that I brought... I'm dropping it myself. This wedding should never happen. Manoharetta! I am also a patient. Is this a hospital or what? So many patients... This disease doesn't have a cure... and moreover, this disease doesn't have eyes or ears... and this disease won't be cured. My undying love for her. Because of that... Only because of that, I did a mistake to you. Mistake? - Send that boat to the east, you idiot. They have reached the junction. - Move the mic! Go ahead and announce it! Okay! - Start the boat! My dear people, The pride of this village, our sweetheart and favourite, our dear Kunjumon's... Puthenpuraykkal tours & travels' fourth houseboat service... Boss! They are coming. Are you going to marry Manoharan's sister, boss? Shouldn't you be showing all this to her? You idiot! If Manoharan is impressed with me, then she is my girl. What I did was wrong. It was due to my love. I did it out of my love for her. But I won't surrender her for any disease or medicine! Kunjumon! Let her do anything she wants to me! Let her hit me. Let her kill me. But this Kunjumon won't be alive without her. I'll look after her. I love her. I love her, Manoharetta. Manoharetta... I didn't know that she was an unwell child. It's okay. - Manoharetta... Saw who's coming? Tell him. - You tell him. You tell him. - Sir... Look who's coming! Manoharetta... - Oh! It was the patient? I got scared. You carry on. - Okay. I was just... Why is she going to the tutorial? Who? - Achu. Well... It's you and her, who have to run the tutorial from now on, right? So, to understand everything... What is it? I was just... I... - You? Don't misunderstand me, Manoharettan. No, I won't. If I could get the phone number... That's all? Take it. Say it. - 9847074575. Don't call during the night, okay? It's tomorrow! It's tomorrow! Tomorrow's Kerala lottery. Buy it only if you want to! [Singing] Hello. I was busy due to the purchase of a new boat... That's why I couldn't call you. For this new boat... I want to name it after you, my dear. Shall I do so? Name it Kunjatta P Kumaran. Damn it! Was it you, you scoundrel? Hang up & get lost, you dog! Got happy in vain. Very good! And the crooked Iago... And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker. You shall hear more by midnight. You should take her phone number at least today, boss. I will take it. Come, let's go. Get lost. - Okay! Does he look like he can take classes so well? That smile... That walk.. Moreover, he's a bachelor too. Anyone would look at him! That's true. Kunjumon! Both of them are at a young age. We've seen this so many times. Finally, it shouldn't be like some random guy going away with the girl. 'The marquee is rising up... There's a smile on the lips of the villagers' 'There's a burning ember within the heart' 'The wedding flag is being hoisted... Dreams are rising sky high' 'It gets more exciting as it goes on' 'If the sacred thread for the wedding locket is not prepared properly' 'Things will go for a toss tomorrow, brokers will hang dead' 'It will be an endless deadlock, dear' 'Did you see this wedding festival?' 'The excitement of this festival rises, as you keep watching it' 'We should go buy the wedding dress' 'We should invite the entire Panchayat' 'White-washing all the walls, and hanging lamps all over the way' 'It's a celebration at the bride's house, the groom is in tension' 'Some people to trouble him' 'All the ingredients are coming together, and we are counting days to the wedding' 'Did you see this wedding festival?' 'The excitement of this festival rises, as you keep watching it' 'Who came by your door, without anyone else seeing, O girl?' 'Is it the breeze of the wedding Sindoor, or the full moon, accompanying your man?' 'As the night makes way for day, as the heartbeats become intense' 'The smell and taste of the kitchen is up in the sky, and on our tongues' 'This endless race will come to an end tomorrow' 'Did you see this wedding festival?' 'The excitement of this festival rises, as you keep watching it' You are such a schmuck, Kunjumon! What do you lack? You have lots of money, an office, houseboats... ... and farms too... - Well, what about height? Yeah, right! I'd have gotten him a much better girl, with this height itself. Manoharan dumped this on your head, deliberately. No doubt about that. Of course! He will leave, taking his commission after the wedding. Then it will be my boss, who has to carry someone else's dirty linen for a lifetime! Your boss' life remains, to guard her from jumping over the fence. You!! - Why are you getting angry at him? What's wrong in what he said? There are some games going on, without anyone knowing. No one believes us, right? It's a proposal brought by Manoharan, right? If this is her game towards you, who are going to marry her, what all games she would have played, at that city? You scoundrel! - Leave him! If you have so much daring, you shouldn't be showing it to him. Ask her why she's giving affection to that Master, without giving you, her prospective groom! - I will ask her! You should ask her! You have only one night to ask her that. I will ask her tonight, right away! She will know who this Kunjumon is! Move! He left? Chedathi, did it work? How can it not work? That Manoharan's game would end today! This Tresyamma will end it! You're so naive, Manoharetta. You've conducted so many weddings! But you couldn't even stop this one wedding! First you gave a word here, that you'll get her married to Kunjumon. Later you gave a word in Bangalore, that you'll get her married to Satya. Even after fooling Teacher, Master and these villagers... We couldn't stop the wedding that was fixed, Manoharetta! You can't do it, Manoharetta. You can't! If nothing works, there's a final act of 'Throwing dust in the eye'. I will do that finally. What are you doing here, Kunjettan? To tell her something. Speak softly. This is a bride's house. Who does she think she is? Even after walking in front of me for so long, has she ever felt like talking to me, or even looking at me? She can talk to the outsider who came yesterday! I don't have good looks or education, right? I'm not tall either. By my love within is true! This love and nonsense is useless. Or, if the love is true, can't it be recognized? You tell me. No, Kunjetta. It's hard to recognize true love. If it could be recognized, you wouldn't have asked this to me, Kunjettan. Akshay... Ajmal... Akash... Bhaskar... Kunjumon PP... Kunjumon PP? Sorry. Couldn't you hint it to me at least once? What can I say to you, when your wedding has been fixed? If Achu's mistake was that she didn't recognize your love. You did the same mistake to someone else. To me. Love... It's hard to recognize it. Move! Move! Did you know? Yesterday... He.. Missing... What is he saying? Since yesterday night, our Kunjumon has gone missing. Really? - Yes. After a long 22 years, a wedding has been cancelled in our Mullakkara. But this was too much! - So sad. That poor Master.. - How will he bear this? 'Shop closed today' Look! It's a sad scene, bro. Support me strongly! My dear child, Master... Go! - Master! What am I hearing? - Crying, right? Manoharan... All the villagers are here. The marquee and the feast are ready. To be in a situation in which the groom is missing on the wedding day? How can I face the villagers now? Teacher... If my child does something drastic... ... we won't stay alive. - Oh God! Our Thomas sir's daughter took poison & died. - Oh no! Say it. Say it! Master... Shall I say something? What's the point in saying anything now? You had warned me back then itself, that we don't need this proposal! True. You brought so many good proposals for her. - Yes. We wished that she should be near us, always. And now, what have we done to her life? Say it! Manoharan... You tell me. What should we do now? Master... If you nod your head, we'll get her married to a better boy than that Lilliput, at the time we already decided. Nod your head, Master. Where's your hand? Everything will be beautiful. Nod your head, Master. Here. Give the 'Dakshina' to Manoharan. That's amazing! The drama was fantastic! What a screenplay! Such amazing acting! Many years back, you barged into a similar wedding I had fixed, and destroyed my career! But... Today is my day! Tresyamma, this is not the place to settle the problems between you both. It's my granddaughter's wedding. Please don't create any trouble. I haven't come to create trouble, Master. We came to attend the wedding. But where's the groom you had fixed her marriage with? You needn't interfere in all that. Manoharan & I will decide all that. - That's it. One answer for all the questions. Manoharan. Tresyamma... If he says something, then there are no questions or answers! But there is someone like this here, right? First you gave a word here, that you'll get her married to Kunjumon. Later you gave a word in Bangalore, that you'll get her married to Satya. Even after fooling Teacher, Master and these villagers... We couldn't stop the wedding that was fixed, Manoharetta! He is a cheat! By pimping her to this guy, and taking commission to snatch your money and wealth that way... .. this wedding is a drama that he's performing! Otherwise let him say, that he doesn't know this guy already. Master, I... Is she saying the truth? Did you know him earlier? Did you know him? I considered you like my own son so far. I have only trusted everything you've told me. And you did this to me? - Master, I... Master... Tell me. What was your intention? Wouldn't I give you anything, if you had asked me? Tell me! It was my choice. Manoharettan did all this for me. She is like my daughter, Master. What intention would I have then? I am a brother who had to stay away from my own sister, because I never realized what she wanted. I only wished that you shouldn't go through what I did, Master. But there's one thing, Master. When it comes to marriage, the consent of the girl is the most important factor. It's her choice. It's her life. Agree to it, Master. Everything will be beautiful. It's all for the good, Master. Well, where did our earlier groom Kunjumon go? I raised her so well. I will kill myself. I won't stay alive. There's no point in crying like a dog now. I had told her back then itself, not to let her loose. It must be our daughter. Go and check. Open it. We didn't know anything, Manoharetta. I swear! Don't cry, you fool. Years back, within one moment, if I could get you both married, without this Manoharan's knowledge, in this Mullakkara, no eloping would happen, and neither would a wedding happen! If nothing else works, there's a final act of 'Throwing dust in the eye'. I will do that finally. I'm coming! Manoharetta... You? I... Not the one we love... We should live our life with the one who loves us. Please help us, Manoharettan. Us? We have to get down! And where are they? Hello! Dear, you... - Mom! This is our first night. I'll call you later. For dad... Hello? - The problems here are all solved. Ask them to come to Kerala. Along with them, all of you should also come. Did you understand now? Without the knowledge of Manoharan in this Mullakkara, no first night... Who's next? What is she doing here? What's the time? 9.30 PM. The hag has gone mad! I have to go to Thrissur. I have to find a good groom for actress Samyuktha Varma. Am I okay?
