Hello Doctor. 'Scuse me sir, which way to Flaubert Street? - Why on earth do you want to go there? - None of your business. - Then leave me the fuck alone, that's all I ask! - Be polite. Why should I? Unbelievable; I just ask for directions and instead I get insults. What gives you the right to ask for directions? You never leave us alone, not even in the streets. Must you break our balls on the sidewalk too? No directions, no Flaubert Street, no nothing! Can't you see the man is tired, on the verge of a nervous breakdownÖ Do you want to provoke an incident? Well, I'll be... Donít you agree they have the tendency to piss us off!? All of them! - Are you from around here? - No, from Montrouge. Are they the same in Montrouge? The time will come when it'll be beyond our strength. And then... If they keep on toying with our nerves... Nerves are sensitive... And we have plenty of them. Imagine if they all snapped at once... That will damage their cute little mugs. Theyíll have asked for it. I choke, I suffocate; plain and simple. It's no wonder; they squeeze the air out of us. But it won't go on forever, trust me. Itíll burst. Weíll pack our suitcases. It's final. What would you say if I told you "maquis"? "Maquis"... Let me think... I'd say: undergrowth, a silence where every noise counts, a bird waking up, the crack of a tree branch, a deer leaping out, tiptoeing carefully on the moss. ...worn-out shoes. Itís dawn, clouds of mist hanging about. Suddenly, our leader halts. We reached the rally point in MellŤze, by a dead tree. We wait for the others: guys from Femťrac, from Mťrouge. We sit down, and the ten of us split a pack of fags. Nobody speaks... Weíre smoking the first morning cigarette, the best one. We feel good. A little scared but good. Just us men. We forget about women, we don't care. We don't miss their platform shoes. We puff on our cigarettes and that's it. Then! Our leader produces a bottle of cognac. As he unscrews it, we think: With some luck, he'll share a drop. It's a good one. Aged 15 years. He looks up and understands. The flask is handed around. Not a word is uttered. No matter. Weíre like 10 fingers on a hand. No fuss, no jumble. Look at us, it's been only 45 minutes and weíre already a pair. Solid. No bullshit like: "Let me take you to the movies, let me buy you dinner, what are you doing tomorrow...?" All that is just to give you the hook, there, in the neck and theyíve got you. Calm down; pull yourself together. Since when has your husband been missing? 10 AM. Missing is not the right term. This is more of an absence. But inspector, he left his office without a word to his secretary and without cancelling his appointments for the day. What could the secretary tell those ladies who wouldn't leave before seeing him? By the end of the day, there were more than 30, plus one in on the bench, legs still in the air. His coat was left on the ground. No news since then Has your husband ever shown this kind of behaviour before? Not at all, he's a model husband and a good father. Don't you start that again. I can't stand tears, I'll leave. - Give the lady a Calvados. - Yes, boss. Madam, to your knowledge, did your husband have an affair? Him? Be serious: a gynaecologist! Doesn't that mean anything to you? Asses, Inspector; About 30 to 40 rectal exams a day. And the bitches are crazy about it, some come back everyday. So believe me, in the evening, all he longs for is doing his crosswords while eating a blanquette, and then going to bed. Because the next morning at 7, it's pussies and asses. A happy man then, basically. Please let him be alright. It's a sad thing to see a remarkable woman being dumped like that. - No kidding, I feel better already. - Yes, you do look better. What a bore, this woman on the train, whining about her missing husband. Gives you a glimpse of a typical day in a police station. Missing persons, we get them all day long. No sooner than this morning, a dreadful story: Again, a female. A business woman. Pret a Porter style. She comes in, make-up running down to her chin, a real fountain. To her credit, the man was not the easiest bloke. Not only did he dump her, but whatís more he stole the contents of the cash register. 5 grand, the weekís earnings. - A low class scumbag! - Yup! Not repulsive, that little villageÖ Maybe we couldÖ - Dear Lord. - You can say that again! Good day gentlemen. Whatíll it be? Something cool, what you think is best. I have just what you need. Not very spacious, not very luxurious. - Youíre not very demanding comfort wise? - Oh, no. - Thereís a gas cooker? - A coal one. But very efficient. 3 hours left till before dinner drinks. - With a small onion? - If you have one, Iíll have one. Ah, the cunts! You know what we should do someday? Eat garlic sauce, and not brush our teeth! Ah, the cunts... Take Genevieve, you know who I meanÖ The shopkeeper? Well, she can keep it. Take my word for it, each time we were about to have sex, she gave me mints to suck on. The tobacco stench was annoying the Mrs. Always pissing us off Ö Theyíve really done it this time. Paul... PAUL!!! Whatís wrong? Whatís wrong with you? Thereís nobody thereÖYouíre alone, old chap. See for yourself. No GeneviŤve. What was she doing to you? They bug me even in my sleep. They get under my skull, I canít get them out. I have to sleep, I have to recoverÖ or Iíll never get my head above water. - Iíve wasted enough sleep over them as it is. - Weíre all in the same boat. - I have trouble sleeping as well. - As soon as my eyes are closed, they barge in. We havenít been very reasonable, youíll agree. A chocolate mousse following roasted pork, reallyÖ Heavy stuff. Itís not my fault I have no diplomas, you know? At 16, I had two options: the factory or using my cock for a living. - I wish I had a degree in medicine like you. - Nonsense. Did you choose your specialty? You could have been an oto-rhino specialist, or an ophthalmologist. I just had my pretty face. Iím fed up with being loved. How about a nice omelette. Wouldnít that do you a world of good? - With the mushrooms leftovers? - Sure. And Iíll open the bottle of Gamay. Ah, weíll have to taste it someday. - No, thereís only one thing that could cleanse all that. - What? Tripe. You say that now! You never want buy in advance. Fresh food, fresh foodÖ Thereís more to it than that. As long as we donít take supplies, we wonít be able to fight them. Hey, youíre not alone. That big. - Smells real nice around here! - A small stew. And you? Oh, nothing much. I have to watch my lunches. A small slice of terrine, some goat cheese, ice cream and marmalade. If I overdo it, I get bloated. Go on! Itís midnight; time to get down to it. If you have nightmares after that, Iíll buy you a bottle. Whatís with you? Whatís wrong? I'm not hungry. Neither am I. Thatís no excuse. Careful Albert, if you listen to yourself, youíll go back to GeneviŤve, sucking on those mints. I feel queasy. Well, un-quease yourself. Thatís what beer is for. Nothing like it to make your mouth as good as new. Goes down well? - Goes down well. - Well done! Try the salty stuff. Itís a breeze. Have some mustard. And pickles. - Spices will make you thirsty... Garlic sausage? - Oh no. I'll have some. Glorious cholesterol lies in store for us. - Itís better than sleeping pills, no? - Yes. Healthy food, without chemicals, never has any ill effects. The most precious sleep... the most resting... is the early sleep. So by splitting the night in two, you get two early sleeps. - Doctor! - Yes? My saddle itches. - Ever had any troubles down there? - Thatís my weak spot. Lately, my clitoris is all swollen. At first I thought it was a temporary thing, but now Iím a little worried. It looks like a snout. Every time my husband sees my cunt, he giggles. He calls me Cyrano! - It is my opinion that you are changing sex. - Oh? What a smell! - Iíll have to repent after this meal. - I give you absolution in advance, brother. It smells like thrush. Not as easy as it looks. What Iím eating is divine. There is some thrush in it. - I would say thrush and ruffed grouse. - Yes. - And lark. - Let me add: ortolan. Think of all those poor men whose sole obsession is to catch a glimpse of some little girlís panties. We have this leg of mutton instead. - You heard that? - A thief? - Heís been stealing my plums. Ouch, Father, I wonít do it again. Let me smell you hands. No football game on Sunday! - No, please, not the game! - Little rascal. - Itís not my fault, she started it, that Claudine! - They always start it, the young fools. How old are you? - 14. - Oh those bitches, going after children now. - Thereís no stopping them! You have no idea what I have to sit through during confession. No matter how old, even with a foot in the grave, thatís all they think about. Itís simple, I tell the husbands everything now. Want to know who does your Claudine? Rťmi! Gavot! The new vet. The old hermit. And Iíll leave out the rest. Button your fly! I got trapped exactly like you, my young friend, at your age. I too was considering joining the holy orders. Do you go to mass? - Each time he loses a tooth. - I went to mass every Sunday. Do you know how it ended? An awful waste. Learn from my mistake. My parents had a young maid; 19 years old, straight from Bretagne. She was brand new. Spare us the rest, we know how this works. She brought you breakfast in bed each morningÖ Precisely. The classic trap. Early spring heat. You get aroused under the sheets; a tight blouse thatís waiting to burst open. The hands get lost, itís warm, softÖ Smells of coffee and soap. You confess and do it again the next morning. - And come 40, youíre a wreck. Is this what you want? - No sir. - I never could finish Proust. You know Proust? - Yes, sir. Never got past "un amour de Swan". Imagine, each time I opened the fourth volume., It was like putting on a record " Paul, switch off the lights". Every night for 20 years. They call it marital duty. Am I right Father? Itís part of the sacrament? - The church is rather vague regarding that point. - I want to stay a bachelor, sir. Celibacy; donít think itís easy... Take me, all my life I fought for it. It was like a curse. Each time a woman sees me, she gets wound up. "Here comes Albert" and her eyes get moist. Since my first holy communion, itís felt like my fly is always open. I keep checking it. - We went through Hell, and weíre here to tell you about it. - I bet he hasnít had his dinner yet. Did you have a bite to eat before taking your tart to the movies? - No, Father. Blockhead! Donít you know an under-fed body catches the first disease that comes along? Listen to the doctor. Iíve seen hundreds of venereal diseases in my office. Is this what you want? To piss razor blades? - No more drinking wine? - Go wash your hands, Iíll get you a plate. Whatís great about sugar... is that itíll give you wonderful cavities. Especially at night. It rots them all night long; it really goes for the enamel. We should chew tobacco. With the sugar, pieces of meat, and on top of that the tobacco juice, I guarantee you magnificent stumps, well caramelised. The whole value system needs to be re-examined. What is a priest without a cassock? A soup without salt, a kiss without a moustache. A fart in your trousers will stick to your legs, whereas in a cassock, Itís in the open air. This liquor is strong! Father, may I play the game on Sunday? - Is it good? - Yes, sir. - You tasted the apple charlotte? - Yes, sir. - Still want to fondle that Claudine? - No, Father. - Why? - I like the charlotte better. - So in the end, you married the maid? - Hell no. - My parents had to give her the sack, she was a thief. - Ah, Bretons. Whatís more she gave me gonorrhoea. With this rain, there will be mushrooms tomorrow. We shouldnít sleep in late. Shit, the fuse. No open umbrellas inside the house, itís bad luck. Itís not the fuse, itís the storm. Iím not taking off my clothes, I donít care. Children, children, whatís going on? I'll go. Stupid! Stupid! Sisters. May the Lord be with you. All my life, Iíve seen man and woman tear themselves apart. Letís make peace, and dry our tears. These are troubled times, people woo, they divorce, do drugs. They seek shelter in violence. And instead, in a nice cottage, amongst good people that wake up at dawn, what do we find? Two men, simple and good men. Linked by a fraternal friendship. What do they ask for? A little silence. Does that deserve pillory? Show some Christian charity. I remember when they arrived. A sorry sight. Two shattered men, on the verge of collapse. Just a little silence. This is what they long for: retreat, meditation. A feeling theyíve lost, the feeling of the soil under their feet. Good soil, heavy and rich. That which God intended for the grapevines. So, as I understand it; forget the wife and children. They've left us for no one; nothing, just the soil. Would you rather find them in a hospital? Full of narcoleptics, withering away? - At least we could visit them, kiss them. - Iím here, Iíll take care of them. Theyíre recovering bit by bit, youíll get them back as new men. - When, Father, when? - I donít know. 6 months, a year. Next spring? They need long walks, intensive care, a strict diet. And above all, no annoyances. And during that time, you expect us to become nuns? Yes, do you know of a nice quiet convent, with a chicken coop and rabbit hutch? And a few barrels of Beaujolais. You see, we went down the cellar earlier. Your two apostles are having a swell time: Meursault, PommardÖ What about this? Cough medicine? You seem an expert. Judging by your snout, you drink more than just the mass wine. You three make a fine team. The priest, the pimp and the gynaecologist; nice fable. - It ought to be taught in school. - Do you know there was a theft? - Your friend Albert, who is so ill; didnít leave empty handed. - 5 grand. Nice take, donít you think? - You know the sentence for harbouring a criminal? About 5 years. - Once in the hole, youíll lose your fat. Considering the legitimate claims of the parties involved, maybe we can come to a reasonable agreement. Theyíre still weak on their feet, I donít think I can surrender them indefinitelyÖ However, a recovering walk, at your side, doesnít seem ill advised. They could spendÖ A little weekend with you. The ascension weekend? That leaves you a fortnight to get them in shape. Oxygen, calories, walking. We want them in their finest fettle. - OK. Trust me, this task will be fully accomplished. - Hold on, priest. In the event they donít show up, weíll spend the ascension weekend at your place, In your little hideout. And weíll stay a while, to get in shape as well. Youíll bring us breakfast in bed, with the morning paper. Youíll read us our horoscope. And youíll scratch our back in the bathtub. Youíll go to the drugstore to buy our stuff: nail polish, beauty creams, and our little tampons. Youíll do our laundry, and hang it to dry in the sun... Itíll be nice, lace over cauliflowers. With us next to it, getting a tan, in bikini. Youíll get all of our affection, since the others are gone. Weíll still need a man. What is you first name? Emile... Watch it, Emile. Better do as your told. - Have courage, time to go! - I canít. What do you mean "I canít"? Whatís the meaning of this? Are you grownups or what? Itís just for a while. You do your business and come back. I canít do it for you. Iíll come and get you on Sunday evening, and the dinner will be ready. The Lord be with you, youíll be in my prayers. If you have the time, get me some green peppercorns. - Weíll have a West Indian dish. - Good morning Father. - Morning Fouchard, howís the blood pressure? - 22;23Ö - Stop the Chirouble. - Whatíll I have left? - Your wife. You have intercourse with her? - Weíll been married for 25 yearsÖ Like on the first day, Fouchard, make it swing! In every room! If not, our village Ö Boom! Say, what about grabbing a bite at La Villette? The four of us? A nice marrow steak? - Thatíd be great. - Yes, then a good western and tomorrow the football gameÖ You have a nice place... The children arenít home? Theyíre at their grandmotherís for the weekend. Oddly they felt a sudden urge to see her. Too bad, I would have liked to kiss them. You can walk them to school on Monday. - The maid is away too? - Yes, on special leave. - Too bad. Sheís better? - Fine. - No more cough? - No. - What about her knee? - Put down your bag. You notice nothing. - No. - On me. - No. - And like that? - No. - Smell nothing? - No. - My perfume. - Ah yes, I recognize it. - No, itís a new one. - Ah, thatís what I thought. - Paul? - Yes? - Have you got any balls left? WellÖ Whatís in the fridge? - Paul. Iím ready. - Iím coming. - Paul? - Yes? Iíve thought about it a lot. We didnít go far enough. Love was not enough. We have to get past the mere satisfaction of our senses. I read a lot while you were away. A fascinating world opened to me. Paul, we still have a long journey to make. The time has come to tackle the purest of eroticism. Pleasure for the sake of pleasure. Misery can be a source joy. Without boundaries. Iím ready to endure sufferingÖ shameÖhumiliation. Iím waiting Ö for your command. I'll always say yes. Be my master. Speak. Tell me what you want. Some extra toasts to finish the foie gras patť... Paul! Get out of there! Paul: Come here! Paul, I remind you that you are my husband. You have to screw me. Come inside, youíll catch a cold. Take my suit, there, on the chair. Donít mind her, when sheís in that stateÖ She sees nothing, hears nothing. Hey darling, your mother had an accident, ran over by a car. You see, she doesnít give a shit. Take my watch. Go on. - Paul! - Albert! - Iím scared. - Donít start shitting your pants. Itís a survival operation. Them or us. I canít cast away the image of that black mass theyíve got between their legs. Have a drink. Okay, let's keep moving. This wonít end well. Weíre headed for global catastrophe. Relax. Breathe slowly. Itís a flat road. No wind, no rain. Ideal temperature. Left foot forward. And the right foot follows. - Whatís in your bag? - My wife. I killed her. There goes a brave boy. I wanted to show you the picture of my wife. Ugly! Oh my, quel horreur! Now you understand! Donít be frightened, honey, Iím here. Raymond! Where are you going Raymond? - Raymond! - Maurice! Maurice! Excuse me, I have a question. Itís lovely to stroll in the countryside, head in the clouds. But whatís the agenda now? Is lunch taken care of? A tea trolley, some lunchboxes? Where are we to sleep? Beds? Camp beds? Tents? So, who's the leader here? Who's the man in charge? - So itís anarchy. - Why donít you go home. And how? Is the return ticket included? Is there a shuttle? - Where are we exactly? You have compasses, maps? - What for? Donít you like it here? In charge of what? Well done! We travel at random. We take the risk of falling into swamps. Iím not too keen on catching malaria. Do you have the antidote? What if I get bit by a snake? Do you have vaccine or am I to die on the spot? - I have a wife and children. - So what are you doing here? I followed the crowdÖ When I see men walking, I follow. - Itís my right to do so, Iím free. - And dumb as well. A real blockhead. Never saw a blockhead like that. - Nearly as dumb as my mother-in-law. - When youíre dumb like that, you just have to shut you mouth. Thatís what Iíve been telling my mother-in-law for 10 years, but itís no use, she canít help jabbering. During the matches as a rule. Listen! Shut up and listen! - How many men? Iíd guess about 300 fellas. -Yes. Weíll see what we can do. 6 sheep, all right? 2 Futail, 2 Cahors. Not quite ripe, but stringent. 30 loafs of bread. And 40 grams of tobacco a fellow, canít do better. Sign here. Simple formality, you never know, there might be some accounts to settle by the end of the hospitalities. I sure hope that wonít be happening in a hurry though, we seem all set not to return to our homes soon. - God forbid! - Hurry. We have to leave in an hour to supply the guys from Bergement. The chiefís gulp... 15 years old! How are they doing in Bourgogne? No news. Villages are isolated, phone lines are down, cattle has taken to the woods. Itís beginning to take shape. How're their spirits? Your guys donít think too much about getting laid? They have some many kilometres in their legs by the end of the day, that they justÖ Thatís the way to do it. Walking and more walking. Gulping down kilometres. "I take the maquis, with my pals, I go to the pub, we have a few drinks. Time for Kir and Picon with beer, Pernod and Beaujolais.

Sorry, old chap, we have to goÖ Hey guys, wait for meÖ God almighty, have mercy on a poor sinnerÖ Spare the miserable GeneviŤve the loss of my life. I would love to hold her in my arms, give her a child, marry her. GeneviŤve, I give up being a pimp! Docteur Dufour, my wife booked an appointment with you; Tomorrow at 9 am. - As of today, I wonít finger anything but chicken. - Donít be a fool, youíll make them cross. Ok, donít get angry, but Iím through with all this. Iím going home. Stop by the shop sometime, Iíd be glad. 240 Vaillant-Couturier blvd, Montrouge. Weíll enjoy a snack. Iím past the age for running like that. Not to be a downer, but itís a little late to go home with a bunch of orchids... ListenÖ Whatever we do, weíre fucked. We should have gotten organised from the start. Now, all is lost. The resistance groups are falling one after another. Fleurac, Mťrouge, the Bergement. - Itís not really war, I must be dreamingÖ - Worse than war. There is no surrendering, no Geneva agreement, nothing. Just raise your arms, and straight to the cock. That all that matters to them: the cock! They blow you dry. Bir hakeim, Les Ardennes, that was tourism. No more mercy now. 30 to one. Moroccan fighters were schoolboys compared to them. And when theyíre done, here come 30 more. And 30 more. And it goes on to infinity, like a tide. All of that on my cock. The Krauts themselves wouldnít have done it. It was like sitting on a landmine that blows up again and again. - Let me have a look at the thing, Iím a doctor. - Oh no, itís a shameful mess. - And the grub? Whoís handling it? - No one. They destroyed all of the supplies, intercepted all the convoys. They're cutting down the vineyards of Bourgogne. In Meursault, they tore them down vine by vine. Worse than Philoxera. A cultural heritage smashed down. Silly cunts. Happy now? Bravo! Well done! Look at all the tarts. Is this the new summer collection you are wearing? Just one look at you makes me want to join an order. Just wait till I polish you. Weíll see whoíll call for his mommy. I take it and make it swell until it bursts. Follow me? Iíll speak to you the day you arouse me. And I donít see that happening soon. What about these? What if I got your dick stuck in these? Shut the fuck up! Watch it now, my gals want a piece of you. I have a hard time holding them back. Madam, for the time being, just one thing will get us hard. The Beaujolais. veal Blanquette, Roquefort, frangipani, Brown tobaccoÖ and calm. Ever heard the word "Calmos"? CALMOS! Hey, girls, one of them has a touchy anus. He got so scared that he shit his pants. - Hurry. - Miss, be reasonable. - Enough! Letís examine the situation, letís see clearly. What you want, stop me if Iím mistaken, is to get laid. Youíre suffering from withdrawal symptoms. You may spit at us but we come in handy sometimes. Unfortunately, my pal and I donít especially have sex in mind right now. What we would like, is to get a bit more rest, regain our health, and be 20 again. The age where only one thing counted: Sex! All the time, sex and sex again. So gently free us, without shooting us in the back. In exchange, and this is no joke, weíll meet in a month from now, anyplace you want, and weíll do you all. We do you one after the next, like horny bitches. Weíll give you the works, and youíll be begging us to stop, I promise. - Stop bragging, I wet my panties. - Iím ovulating like crazy, give me a baby, quick. Weíll call him "the fart", after his father. "What we need is a piece of cock, a fat piece of cock in our pussy. I need you to jiggle, until I can't take no more." Shut the fuck up. Shut up motherfuckers. Shut it; Iíll use one of you as a club to knock down the others. What the hellís going on? You think this is a whorehouse? All leaves are cancelled. And tonight, forced march with your packs. And moonlight river crossing. That will relax your taints. As for you, tough guys, stop exciting my girls. Easy now, weíre not provoking anyone. Itís a misunderstanding. Donít you have a something to nibble? Even cold? Weíve been walking for 3 days away from our base. soÖ Wait, I have some condensed milk left. Gets you going, doesnít it? - Want some? - No, thanks. - Youíre waiting for a tablecloth and some candles? - When do we get to polish the bald stick? - Should we take them to a wedding dress shop? - Or wait for the night as itís more intimate? Go on, chief, letís do it, my clitoris is fully engorged, it wonít go further. Not now, girls. The best part of love is climbing up the stairs to the bedroom Having them walk in front of me makes me fall in love. In the dust. One, two, one, twoÖ They're aware we can grab their nuts anytime, anywhere we want. Yeah, well, tired legs and an empty pussy ainít my motto. - I said; not now! - Then when? Itís been months since we got a sniff of a cock. Come on, ladies, say something or weíll get screwed around some more. - Whoís in charge here, you or me? - SimoneÖ I want a piece of it too. Just like you. But not in a careless way? You want to guzzle it down, jump on them on the spot. - Wouldnít that be too easy, too bland? - But that would clear up our lungs. Monique, show some distinction, some class, goddamnit! A twist of poetry! War is not havoc. Learn to respect your enemy. Victory is victory, not humiliation. Look at those prisoners you dragged in. Do they give honour to the troop? I ask you? Halt! Men. Itís fighters I want, and Iíll have you fight. In a fair game. Listen, Dufour. Earlier, you had a spurt of pride, and I liked it. Letís play open cards. I agree about the rendez-vous. Not in a month, but tomorrow. A 24 hour head start. A 24 hour probation, 24 hours to run like mad. I like the enemy running up and down, when tracking him down. The hunt. It excites me. Night and day. The smell of his piss in the ferns. Arrive where the tracks are still warm. They haven't had their fill of sweat yet. They still smell of aftershave. Theyíre too tender, too young. Not enough mileage. They have to be well burnt out. Caramelised. Aldente! Hard under the tooth. I get wet just thinking that Iíll have one of them, this time tomorrow. Which one? You see Dufour, I like your buddy. - Whatís your name? - Albert. Albert. Well tell Albert, that tomorrow heís going there. Right there, the chiefís pussy. Fuck. Why always me? Iím not the only one! There are others. And better looking. Iím fed up. Always the same. I disagree. You have the bad luck of having some charm, andÖ With a weapon to top it all. If I had a weapon, Iíd scare you as well. Thatís easy. Whatís not easy is to woo us, to seduce us. To make us look back when you walk by. But let me tell you, itís not by wearing khaki pants and General Patton perfume that weíll ask you to tango. Hey, Paul? We like a nice revealing neckline showing your back, a long cigarette holder. That moves us. But your ĎOne, two, one, two", thatís a big turn off! Donít let your tongue grow tired, cause youíll need it tomorrow, - And not for a speech! - You think your medals will give me a hard-on?! Listen Albert, once I catch you, you wonít last long. Moved or not moved, youíll retract your foreskin. Finger, hard-on and bang, a flagpole. And hard; or itís electroshock treatment. Electrodes up your ass, my good man. Very erogenous zone, the asshole. And no premature ejaculation, they tried it on me before. Youíll wait for me. All in the hips, relaxed motion. Youíll whisper nice things in my ear, Iím sure. And then, Iíll give you to my girls, and switch to Dufour. Go! Get out of here. On the double. And donít stroke it too much! Iíve had it Polo. My head is swirling, my ears are ringing, Iím at the end of my rope. Take a deep breath, itíll go away. I have to eat, that's what. Eat! Or Iíll faint. Iím not asking for much. Anything. A crust of bread, a bit of cheese. If you say one more thing about food, Iíll hit you in the jaw. 3 days.. 3 Days without food. Not even an onion. Youíve been warned. Know what you are? A misogynist. Have a drink! Jesus Christ! - A small unpretentious Rosť from the area. - Very sweet. Grab a bite. It would be nice, but they expect us for lunch down in the village. Some ham never spoiled the appetite. Cheers! Solid. Careful, weíve have been drugged. - Whatís this!!! - Whatís between my legs?! Tell me the truth doctor, I have to know! Operate!
