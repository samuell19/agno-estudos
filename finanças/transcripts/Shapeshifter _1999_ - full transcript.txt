(MultiCom Jingle) (ominous orchestral music) (flames crackling) (singing in foreign language) (flames crackling) (ominous music) - [Alex] I had a crazy summer. Things happened to me I never dreamed could happen. It began with this watch my father had. If you set it the right way, it transmits a locator signal. (chattering) - This is it, 66 East River. - This place looks okay. How long do you think we'll stay here? - Your mom and dad are out of the spy business. You've made your last move. - No way. - That's why we've come to Glenville. It's quiet. We can blend in and get on with a new life. - Really, you quit the company? - Really. You're Alex Brown for now and forever. - I thought they never let you just drop out. Once you're in the game, you're in for life. - The Cold War's over, son. - Does this mean you're gonna have to get a job? - We're thinking about opening a hardware store. Why don't we unpack, hm? - Can we keep some of this stuff? - Probably not. Operations keeps a fairly tight inventory. (mysterious music) (mechanical whirring) (snoring) (dramatic orchestral music) (dart whizzing) - [Man] Find the boy. We're wasting time. Burn and move. (flames roaring) (coughing) (spraying) (phone dialing) - I need to talk to field operations manager regarding a code yellow. - [Woman] Vid com is for you. You'd better take it. - Gelardis here, what can I do ya? - I'm calling about operatives whiskey x-ray two and four. - Who are you? - Their son, Alex Brown. They kidnapped my parents. - Alex, slow down and tell me what happened. - I don't know, they spoke an Eastern European dialect. What language, I couldn't know for sure. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine, it's my parents I'm worried about. - Alex, your parents quit two weeks ago. They don't work for us anymore. - Does that mean you're not gonna help? - Of course we're gonna help. - Why were we living in the Ukraine? - We've been trying to crack a smuggling op. - Drugs? - No, worse than drugs. Plutonium, uranium. - Weapons grade? Who's behind it? - General Victor Petrov. He plans to build an array of portable nuclear weapons and deploy them. - Sounds bad. - If he executes his plan, it will be. I've got a lot of manpower working on it. If your parents surface in country, we'll let you know, and we'll see what we can do to extricate them. Meantime, I need you to sit tight. We'll send someone over. - You know where to find me. Over and out. (beeping) (beeping) - Testing one, two, three. Testing. I'd like to order a car service to take my son to the airport. As soon as possible. He needs to be on a four o'clock international flight. I need to go downtown.`` (beeping) (speaking in foreign language) (rapid beeping) Stop. (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) - English spoken here. - Do you sell Rolex? - Rolex? Yes, but for a boy your age I would recommend something cheap, but I can-- - Only dorks wear those. - Excuse me, dork? What is dork? - It's a noun we use to tease someone. Can also be a verb, as in you're dorking out. It's that one right there. - [Merchant] It's a beauty. Of course, the band could be adjusted. Just came in yesterday. - Yeah, from where? - Estate sale. - Estate sale? - You know, when someone dies. I can assure you my suppliers are quite reputable. - How much? - This is a $2,000 watch, but right now today, I can give it to you for only half. - 200. - You got the 200? (speaking in foreign language) (lively string music) - A bed is five dollars American a night. Common bath. Checkout is 11:00 a.m. - You have lockers? - There is a two dollar key deposit. - You serve meals? - There is a food stand a block away. That's where most of the kids go. Where are you form? - Iowa. - What country is that? - It's not a country, it's a state in the United States. - Oh, you plan to stay here a while? - Could be. Don't kno`w yet. - Well, there is much to see. You traveling alone? - My parents are up the street at the hotel, but they sent me here. - You're joking. - Yeah, I'm alone. - Sightseeing? - Kind of. It's been a long day. You are? - Anika. - I'll see you later, Anika. (upbeat rock music) ♪ It's not a question of why or where or when or what ♪ ♪ Don't even try to pretend ♪ - We are going to checkout Bjork. - No way. Bjork's playing Bucharest? - Yeah, it's an unscheduled appearance. - It's going to happen over at Hard 'n Heavy club. - We've got an extra ticket, we can sell it to you. - Face value, or are you gonna scalp me? - Do I look like a kind of guy who does such a thing? - Do you really want me to answer that? - You're pretty funny for an American. - Thanks for the offer, but I gotta stick around. I got some thinking to do. - Oh yeah, don't hurt yourself. - Need to figure out my next move. - Your next move is obvious. Music is good for the soul. - You're coming with us. You look far too serious for your own good. ♪ And it's easy to see ♪ (crowd chattering) (hard rock music) ♪ Take me away ♪ ♪ I wanna live in your dreams ♪ ♪ I wanna live in your dreams, I do ♪ ♪ I wanna live in your dreams ♪ ♪ I wanna live on ♪ (light ethereal music) ♪ And I wanted just to touch you ♪ (knocking) - Can I help you? - Yes, I'm lost, and I thought you might be able to point me towards the youth hostel. - I don't know where the hostel is, sorry. - But do you have a phone, and I can call and find out? - No, no phone here. I would have no one to call. Sorry, I must get back to my practice. - Were you playing that music? - What music? Where were you when you heard it? - In the square. In a rock and roll club, actually, but suddenly all I heard was this sound. - Rock and roll, such noise can make the drums ring. Perhaps your ears played tricks with you. - No, I saw things too. - You saw things? - Yeah, smoke that turned into shapes. - Please. Come in. What's your name? - Alex. - Did you get separated from your parents, Alex? - Kind of, they were kidnapped. I came here to find them. - It's a tall order for a young man. Why not try the police? - In our line of work, you try to avoid the law. - What is it that you do? - We're spies. - A family of spies. Nothing surprises me anymore. And for whom do you spy? - This company in Virginia. - And they cannot help you? - I don't know anymore. I just want to see my mom and dad again. - Now, stay here, Alex, and I'll do what I can to help you. My name, you see, is Janos Behari. They call me Jango. My home is your sanctuary. And I can see that you need to rest. - What is it? - It is called the glass harmonica. - Where did you get it? - It came from the divine inspirations that struck one Benjamin Franklin, the very one who harnessed electricity. - How come I've never seen one? - Those were dark times a century ago. The dictator came to believe that the glass harmonica could steal a man's soul and destroyed all the instruments he could find. But a few survived. - No way. - You know, Alex, some could stand where you stand and hear nothing. - Why not? Wax in the ears? - Because they are not tuned to the cause of greater cosmic harmony. - Sounds very new age. - No, it's very old age. The great pyramids of Egypt were levitated by the sounds of chanting. And here, strange and marvelous instruments were played to awake the secret life of the forests. Remember, Alex, it was you who said you saw things although they weren't real. - I still feel that way. I kinda hope I'm gonna wake up and find out none of this real. - No, Alex, it's very real. You have a special gift. - Look, I think maybe I better get going. - Going where, Alex? This is where you need to be. It is your destiny. The legend says one boy will come and he will be able to see music, and he will change like the notes in a scale. Do you know what a shape shifter is? - I think so. Something that can chift from one shape to another. - At once all things and itself. - That's not possible. - It's quite possible. Think, thank hard of being something you're not, like a dog, and I will play. And then you will see just how realistic reality can be. (light airy music) (barking) (shouting) (barking) (screaming) - I will not stop depriving you of food, water, or sleep until I hear names. You know, the operative list. - My name is Mark Brown. And until last week, I sold textbooks to the caller's market in Russia. - Sure you did. Even the strongest souls cannot endure my methods. (barking) - Get on. - You saved my life, why? - Because I hate them and what they do to people, and I will fight them every way I can. As long as those like Petrov continue to operate, freedom is in danger. - If you wouldn't have been there-- - You would've been cooked. What were you doing at La Bianca? Don't you know it's an evil place? - I didn't know. - American tourists are so stupid. - What can I do to repay you? - Nothing, don't worry about it. You better just get out of Bucharest. - Can't do that. - Why not? - Still have things to do here. - They will catch you, and you will disappear. - I need to see man named Jango. - That can be arranged. - You know him? - All the gypsies do. He is the last master of the old arts. - I'll be right back. (lively string music) - So how did you meet Jango? - I heard his music. Sorta wandered in. - He doesn't let just anyone in off the streets, you know. Says a lot about the kind of guy you are. - I guess I'm lucky. - Stay out of trouble. - I'd like to see you again some time. - I didn't know if I'd recognize you when you returned. - I'm glad to be just Alex gain. - The shape shifting, how did it feel? - Like I'd been in that dog's skin since I was a puppy. But then I changed back to me. I couldn't control it. - You were afraid. - Running for my life. - You will learn to not be afraid, then you will see just how your power will grow. - I'm not sure I want it to grow. - Sure you do. Admit it was fun. - No, there was nothing fun about it. I smelled my parents, saw the building they were in. - Where was it? - Across town, it's like a fortress. Maximum security. - [Janos] La Bianca, headquarters of Victor Petrov. - The plutonium smuggler, he's the one. That's his plan. Bring the plutonium in, make a bomb, blow it up. Kill millions of innocent people. - Your parents were involved with this man? - They were working on a sting. He was the target. That's why he's got 'em. - You can get them back. You have the power of legends now. - No, sir, I don't need magic. I need good, old-fashioned American muscle. - What are you doing? - Coming in from the cold. This is as secure as it gets. The signal goes from me to a satellite up there and straight to the receiver. - And then? - And then presto, you talk like you're on a pay phone. They see you, you see them. (phone dialing) - [Gelardis] Where are you? - In country. - We told you to stay put. - I couldn't. Things just happened. - Where are you now? - [Alex] With a friend. - Are you safe there? - Absolutely. - Get yourself to the American embassy, and we'll get you out. - I'm not leaving yet. - Alex, I'm in Bucharest. - Good for you. - Meet me at the outdoor market place in old town in 1500 hours. You know it? - I'll be there. - [Gelardis] How did you get to Romania? - The usual ways. - You're on their trail, aren't you? - Yeah, I know where my parents are. - You're a good son, but you're way out of your league. - That's why I called you. - We're doing everything that we can do to get them out. - Then why are they still captive? - It's not as easy as sending the troops in. - Why not? - There's procedures here. The director of operations said no cavalry here. It's a hostage situation, it's not a crisis. - It's a crisis to me. - It's a crisis to me too. That's why I'm here. Look, Alex, we need you to back off from this one. - I'm sure the media would really love this. CIA parents behind foreign bars. Kid to fend for himself. - This is a delicate situation. If you don't stop now, we're gonna take you until it's over. You understand me? (dramatic music) There's no place to go, Alex. - So there's a boy who becomes a dog, he's connected to the CIA, and then he becomes a bird. What is this, Animal Kingdom or a terrorist organization? - Sir, I just thought it imperative to tell you what I saw. - I believe too much vodka made you see what you saw. (laser blasting) Bring me that boy. Don't fail me again, or you too will wind up in the box. - Wow, that's amazing. - You're coming to enjoy your skills. - I flew. - And the view, how was the view? - A rush. Better than Disneyland. - And your friends from the company you spoke of? - They're not my friends anymore. - They were less than helpful. - They've got a different agenda. - What will you do? - What any operative would do, stay calm, stay under, assess resources, acquire intelligence, make a plan, attack. - It won't be so easy. There are things you can't plan. They just evolve as you go. - I need a way in and a way out. - There are catacombs under the city, but they are like a maze. - I can find a route. Sewer system plans, electric conduits, building blueprints. - There is one who knows. I will take you to him tonight. - Right now. - I couldn't find him right now if I wanted to. He only comes up at certain hours. - Comes up? - It is practice time. - Don't you think I've had enough practice? - Not at all. Your hands have yet to touch the glass. - What is that? - It's a griffin, part lion, part eagle. You don't see them anymore. When I was young, they were quite common. - Just how old are you anyway? (airy ethereal music) - I play soothing strains for your tired soul. - Look, maybe you shouldn't. Things have been a little out of control. - I see. Then I can create it from my brain to my hands. From the hands to the bowls. From the bowls to the stars. Now you try. You wet your hands. You caress the lips. (airy ethereal music) I think you'll see that you have a natural ability. (electrical buzzing) - General, I've been expecting you. I have sensed a strong energy. Our enemy is near. - A curious boy was spotted outside the La Bianca. - There are lots of curious boys. - But this one could shape shift. - He who can change like the notes of a scale will come to fight our evil force. Ancient prophecy comes true. - Certainly you have ways to counter. - The difficulty is very strong, but he does not know it yet. - Then you must act quickly. - I have waited long for this battle against peace and the moment before the dark time. Are the warheads ready? - Soon we are to receive the necessary plutonium. And then the clock will begin to tick. - And fire will rain ashes onto people. - We will dance together on scorched Earth. - If you're lucky. (lively string music) - This place you want to go, it's very dangerous. - I'm willing to take the risk. - Soldiers patrol the towers. - Remnants of the Securitate. - I thought the Securitate crumbled. - They want you to believe that, but this Petrov is one of them. - It won't be cheap to get there. - I'm prepared to pay. - $1,000. - Half now, half when we get there. - Oh, you'll get there. I know the underworld. You ready to go? (upbeat string music) (alarm blaring) - Come on in, little kiddies. - Here you go, the La Bianca. You're on your own, good luck. (hissing) - Nothing will help you, little boy. Your mind is slush compared to mine. Tell me why you dare to enter here. - I came. I came to get my parents. - Oh, how heartwarming. Darling, I have a surprise for you. - I love surprises. - I know you do, especially when they come in jars. - The shape shifter. - The very one all your guards could not capture. - He would do nicely in our collection, but we should vaporize him. - Not yet, I'm having too much fun. Darling, do you have any American prisoners here? - Of course, I always do. I've invited a couple for a little, how should I say, diplomatic visit. - Who are they? - CIA, Dana and Mark Brown. - This boy, he is their son. - Of course. - Loose ends damage our cause. - I thought we had eliminated him from the picture. - And again I must correct your errors. Sometimes I wonder why exactly I keep you around. - You keep my around because only I will love you as we lay waste to the planet. - Let's visit those Americans. Come, little one, it's time for a family reunion. You wanted to see your parents. Well, here they are. (laughing) - [Alex] Mom, Dad! Mom! - You do have a delightful sense of irony. - Let's leave them. I think the boy should be allowed this moment for all of his heroic efforts. (laughing) (lively string music) (speaking in foreign language) - Your friend is in trouble. - That seems to be his nature. - The guard has captured him. - That doesn't surprise me. - Your attitude surprises me. - No, no attitude. I'm tired. We have been around 363 years. - It is not possible. - It's possible because of this. - What is it? - A life stone. When I picked it up as a little boy, I was given the privilege of carrying it until now. It seems another's here to take my place. - Alex is not taking anyone's place. He's been shrunk and put into a jar. - Oh, poor boy. And so brave. Thanks. Thanks for coming. - You must do something. - I must be alone. I must play. (airy ethereal music) (glass shattering) - [Guard] Huh? Hey. - [Alex] Mom, Dad, it's me. I'm gonna get you out of here. Get up, get up. - Huh, what? - Come on, Mom, up. Get up. We've gotta move fast. - [Mark] The safe house. - [Alex] That's right, Dad, we're gonna get you to the safe house, but first we gotta get out of here. - Come on. Capture them you idiots! Don't let them get away! (screeching) - I was having a dream that I was flying over the city. - I was having the same dream. - Mom, Dad, it's me. It's your son, Alex. - I don't have a son. - We need to make contact with our handlers. - They're not your handlers anymore. You're out of the agency, remember? - [Mark] Who are you? - Just a friend. - [Mark] CIA? - Yeah. - Where are we? - You're in Bucharest. - Do you know the safe house location? - We're almost there. (buzzing) - [Woman] Yes, may I help you? - Please, we're American citizens seeking diplomatic refuge. It's a matter of national security. - I'm glad to see you alive and well. Must have been horrible in there. What happened? - What usually happens. They ask questions. - What kind of questions? - Names of other field ops. - Did you provide any? - I don't know. To tell you the truth, I don't remember. - Clear the field, the pasture's no longer safe. Privacy. And as for you, Alex. - How are they? - You wanna tell me how you did this? - You wouldn't believe me. - Oh, I might. You know, the last time I saw you, I didn't see you. I saw a bird. - That was slight of hand, you know, like card tricks. - Oh, I know card tricks, but this was no trick. I swore I saw you change. - Sometimes the eyes lie. - Sometimes people lie. Alex, I don't want you to get defensive, but we're very interested in your skills. - Are you trying to recruit me? - I didn't drag you here. You got in the thick of things on your own. Far as I'm concerned, you should be home in school. - I want to go home. I just wasn't gonna leave without my parents. I need to see them now. - Not yet, they're still in shock. They need to rest. It's gonna be okay, Alex. I'm gonna arrange transport out of country. You don't wanna fly commercial under the circumstances. - You got an extraction time? - 2300 hours. You've done great work here, son. - Janos. Janos! - You must continue to play. That is the only way. - No. No. (somber music) What are you? - Human and digital, an avatar. In the future, there are many like me, Alex. - How do you know my name? - There is much I know. I am coded with all history. A trillion petabytes of pure seeing matter. Let me show you the future if you do not act now. - You're from the future? - I was launched into deep space 200 years from now. Time shifted through black holes to arrive in the past and wait for you. - Let me get this straight. You come from the future, you landed in the past, and you've been waiting till the present? - Exactly, at which point you come in. - Why me? - You live in a system of planets and stars with sirens standing on each sphere, the notes of the planets. You are the note for the Earth. - Look, I can't even hold a tune. - Without one sphere, the others do not exist. The loss of Earth will come to threaten the very cosmos. That is what we learned. That is why it's critical for you to act now. - It's not just the Earth I'm supposed to save, it's all the planets? - You're wasting time. Today, Petrov gets the plutonium that he'll use to make his bombs. You've got to stop that from happening. Are you going to play? - Where's the drop? - There's a trucking station at Karuk. You're looking for a blue station wagon, you got that? - Yeah, I got it. And what am I supposed to do once I'm there? - You get the plutonium. - And how am I supposed to do that? - You're the spy, you figure it out. - [Anika] Jango? - They got here before I did, I'm sorry. - It's my fault. - You can't blame yourself. - I can. I was being tailed and I didn't realize it. - Has it always been this way? - What way? - You know, an evil man and his reign of terror. People looking over their shoulder at every turn. - Always in my lifetime. My parents knew peace once. They told me about it. - Where are your parents now? Petrov. - They disappeared three years ago. There was never any trace of them. - Why? - They belonged to a dissenting party that spoke against the rise of the guard. - If the guard can rise, it can fall. I'm gonna see to it. - We gypsies think that you are the one that can do this. The only one. - Why do you think so? - Because of the prophecy. He who can change like the notes of a scale will deliver us from evil. - You saw me shape shift? - I did. I've known all along. - You don't think I'm some kind of freak? - No, of course not. What you have is a great honor. You are a man of destiny, and to be your friend pleases me. - We don't have much time. Do you know the Kuruk cargo facility? - A smuggler's den, I will take you there. - It won't be safe for you. - I'll take my chances. - Gimme a hand here. Open this. I need to take the glass harmonica. It cannot fall into the wrong hands. (lively string music) - What now? - Take the glass harmonica and this stone to the American embassy. Tell a man named Gelardis that they're from me and need priority security. I'll meet you there at 2300 hours. - You mean 11 o'clock? - Yeah. Sorry, it's just the way I learned to talk. - That's okay, Alex, I like the way you talk. It's kind of cool. It makes everything kind of exciting. Good luck. - Dr. Maximov, I'm so pleased to see you. How was your drive? - It was pleasant in the mountains. - Any trouble at our border? - None. - We have been eagerly awaiting your arrival. Your gift to our cause will reverberate throughout history. - It's not a gift, it's a sale. - Right. Do you have the plutonium? - 12 kilograms of highly enriched heavy weapons grade. Do you have the sum we discussed? (laughing) Cuff him! (mechanical whirring) Fire! (gunshots banging) - [Guard] Let's get out of here! (coughing) (coughing) - I should've vaporized you when I had the chance. I won't make the same mistake twice. (electrical buzzing) (dull thudding) - I believe timber would be the right thing to say. You have returned to us what is very sacred. You have rescued it from those who would use the element for evil. - Here you go. How many of you are down here? - It's a secret. Go back to you people, Alex. From below, we will keep an eye on you above. - Wait. My parents. - You got them out, right? - Yeah, but they don't recognize me. - The witch has stolen their souls. You must rescue the spirits. - Take me to where I can find them. - You would be risking all to go there. - I'm ready. (chanting in foreign language) (coughing) (screeching) - The dwarf told me to wait here. He said you'd show. - Do you know everyone in Bucharest? - Everyone in certain circles. - Anika, would you be willing to leave Romania? - Can't, don't have the right papers. - I don't want you to live here in fear. Come back to the U.S. with us. - You're going home? - Well, yeah. - You haven't finished your mission. - I've got my parents back, and Petrov won't be bugging you anymore. - Petrov is a small evil when put next to the Cyberwitch. She is the very devil herself. You know that, you've seen her power. - Not sure I wanna see it again. - There are many besides myself who are counting on you. - A helicopter's gonna drop into a field outside of Bucharest. I'm gonna be on that bird, my parents will be, and you will be too. Don't worry about papers. - First, we have to get out of here. Come on. - Alex. Alex, my dear Alex. We thought we'd never see you again. - Did you think I wouldn't come? - We figured you'd have to break a lot of rules to get here. - I was never afraid you would ground me. - Oh, dear. Hello, who are you? - I am Anika. - [Dana] Pleased to meet you, Anika. - She's coming with us. If it wasn't for her, none of us would be here right now. - Oh. - You know how sometimes you say you wish you had a daughter? Well, here she is. I told her all about Glenville, and she's psyched. - Come here, Anika. Welcome to the Brown family. - You got my instrument? - Yeah, and your pet rock. Quite a high-tech portfolio. (explosion booming) Firecrackers, not gunshots. The people are celebrating. Intelligence reports that Petrov has fallen. - What happened to him? - Street sources say that a magic spy eliminated him. Imagine that. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you? Well, needless to say we're pleased as punch that the way's been paved for democracy. (beeping) (dramatic music) - Sir, all Eastern Europe and Asia has just gone onto technical alert. - What level? - We're at DEFCON four. - Where's the hot spot? - An intruder has taken control of the Finger of God system. - Finger of God? - It's a nuclear missile site, NATO controlled via computer. - Can't they just shut it down? - From what I'm getting here, someone has hacked into the system and hard-coded it to fire. We've got programmers on it, but they can't crack it. - Where are the missiles pointed? - Moscow, Paris, Washington. - This does not sound good. - What time till launch? - No determination. - Can you get online access to defense net? - That's the problem, no one can. - Let me try. (electrical buzzing) (laughing) - This is as far as I get. - All the software in the world couldn't take her on. - She has the power of all black magic. - You know her? - Petrov's right hand. We've met. - She must be stopped. You can do it. - Alex. - I could try, but you gotta give me a guarantee. - [Gelardis] What's that? - She gets the papers she needs. When we lift out of here, she's clear to be on the bird. Good. I need the glass harmonica, and I need privacy. (airy ethereal music) - You have done well, Alex. - If I've done so well, then why are we looking at a nuclear launch? - You have one more fight before you are finished in this ring. - This ring? You mean there'll be others? - Your services for us are just beginning. - Couldn't I just say no? - You are not the kind of kid to just say no. It's not in you. It is in you to defeat the Cyberwitch. - Wasn't much of a match last time I crossed her path. - But now your power has grown, and I will show you the way. - The way where? She's in the fiber-optics. - Exactly. You must become like me in order to find her. Become pure digital matter, that is the only way. Do not resist. You will like the fluidity. (beeping) (laughing) - Welcome to my world, Alex. - It's not your world. - Ah, but soon it will be. There's nothing a little boy like you can do to stop me. - I'm not a little boy. - What are you then? A man or a bird? Fool's folly, that's what you are. (laughing) (flames roaring) Do you like my little inferno? Show you to dare meddle with me. (laughing) There is no escape, Alex. - [Janos] You must continue to play. That is the only way. (airy ethereal music) - Your melodies are no match for me. - You're wrong, witch. (electrical buzzing) (screaming) - Wow. - [Alex] We're right behind you. - You deserve the Medal of Honor, Alex. - [Alex] Whatever. - People up the chain of command are gonna want to know who stopped this thing from happening. - It could just be a mystery. - It's my duty to tell them. - You don't have to tell them how. - I saw what happened in the communications room. That was incredible. - I asked for privacy. - It's my business not to listen to a request like that. - I wrote the code that broke back into the system. That's what you tell them. That's it. - Okay.
