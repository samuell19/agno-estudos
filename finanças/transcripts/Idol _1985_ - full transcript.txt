THE IDOL Open the door! Can you hear me? The police are coming. Are you there? Mr. Korton! Mr. Korton! Open up! Can you hear me? We can’t wait any longer. Help me! Let’s push it together. He’s dead. On Saturday, in Augsburg, West Germany, Piotr Korton, a writer, died in unexplained circumstances. There is a suspicion that he committed suicide. His body was found in a hotel. The police do not provide any further details. However, they found no evidence of foul play. And now the weather. I’m not sure if You should write about him now. Why? He’s dead. Are you going to run the obituaries? - Let sleeping dogs lie. - He didn’t want to leave. - He wanted to come back. - But he didn't. - Do you have it or not? - Of course. I tell you once again. - Hold on, all right? - He’s been waiting for 10 years. He waited, sorry. A few years here or there. What's the difference? And the circumstances of his death... - They say it was a suicide. - It's not completely clear. Nothing was sure with him. Why are you so damn obsessed? You don't need this at all. I don’t understand. - Really? - Yes. You don’t understand that you’re not above suspicion. You don’t understand that you have been in trouble, not me? You don’t get it? It’s time for you to find out what time it is, what year this is, and what times we live in. Trust me. Leave this case alone for now. Stick to the young prose. You promised me this a long time ago. Are you waiting for the young prose to grow old? All right. I’ll do it. But I won’t quit on Korton. Whatever. Whatever. But don’t say I didn’t warn you. All right? We have a deal. I'm sending the interview to the printing house. Excuse me. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. I found it. And here is one of my first texts. 1955. By the way, I loved his first stories. I sensed that he was going to be a great writer. Here are some details about his stay in Paris. - Thank you very much. - You’re welcome. You’re hooked. Why? How? He just stole a piece of my life. I don’t understand. Do you know "Broken Day"? Of course. One of his best short stories. It’s about me. How is this possible? Maybe I'll tell you one day. What about this tape? You think he had recorded something before he died? That's what I heard. Maybe somebody close to him got it? Or maybe one of his old pals? Maybe this actress, Iwicka? I think she lives in Radom. So they say. What can you find there? Last will? Confession? Okay. I’ll try to get you this type. - Thank you. Goodbye. - Goodbye. She was my first girlfriend. I think I was 16. That evening we were walking by the Vistula River. Some hoodlums approached us. They were trying to provoke us. You know, that boorish type of thing. And one of them came closer and kissed Ola. And she run away. It would have been even worse had it not been for the soldiers. It was devastating. I spent the night at the train station. Some drunk guy sat next to me. I told him the story. And that was him. Then he wrote about it in "Broken Day". - How do you know it was him? - I know. Maybe that drunk guy told your story to Korton? It was him! Whatever. You’ve always had a good imagination. I gotta go. Correct the dialogue in the second scene. - Don’t forget about the rehearsal. - Sure. And how did you like? Are you gonna be a bartender? Who knows? It could help me one day. Don't be silly. You will be a scenographer in my theatre. If I ever have a theatre. See you. - Bye. - Bye. This is my first and last replacement. They won’t persuade me again. Are you tired? A bit. Would you like to dance? I was wondering if you are going to ask me. Let’s dance. I don't know. First of all, literature. All these stories, rumours, anecdotes. Stories he wrote about himself. When I read the story, I felt connected to him. As if I were part of him. I decided to meet him. I even started planning a trip to Germany. But you know what happened. It’s too late. Tell me. Was he happy abroad? No. He really wanted to come back. He asked for permission several times. Why were you asking? Just like that. It's too complicated. Tell me. Maybe I will understand. My mother wants to go to Denmark. You know… Father wants to stay. They have been arguing about it for several weeks. What about you? My mother insists that I go with her. I'm trying to explain to her that it's not that simple. I know every inch here. I have friends… I would have to start over. Foreign country, those strangers… See what's going on? I can’t go now. I won’t let you go. It’s not up to us. I told you it was complicated. My name is Tomasz Sołtan. Tomasz Sołtan! Would you set me up with director Grobny, please? I’m doing research about recently deceased Piotr Korton. I know that... Excuse me? Okay. I will call tomorrow. Thank you. Goodbye. A train from Gliwice arriving at Platform Two. A train from Gliwice arriving at Platform Two. What's the matter? My name is Tomasz Sołtan. We spoke on the phone. About Korton. I don't remember. You’re stubborn, aren’t you? How long were we together? A year and a half. How long were we “really together”? Maybe a few months. He used to go into his shell. One day, he disappeared. Nothing new. Then I went to... I don't remember his name, Purda. ...to SPATiF. We were sitting and he suddenly said: "Look!” There is Piotr sitting by the window”. It was him. In his dark glasses. He had poor eyesight, like you. He was ashamed of it. He was hiding it. He didn't even notice me. He was so drunk. He eventually came to us and said: "I’ve just come back from a funeral". And I asked: "Who died? Jesus, what happened?". And he said: "My sister died". And he showed me his black band on his sleeve. A real son of a bitch. He even bought himself a band to entertain the company. Fancy a drink? Turn your head to the right. More. No, it’s just my imagination. He had different hair, different eyes, different voice. Listen. If I could start again, I would change everything. But I wouldn't change him. I sent our spectacle to Wroclaw. - Are you crazy! We won’t make it. - We will. You were gone when I needed you. I had to leave. Look what I got. - It's his. - How do you know? - He lived there. - Probably not only him. Don’t tell me he killed himself. I knew him too well. Motherfucker. You are so easy to persuade. It’s his. No doubt about it. Leave it alone. It won't do you any good. Wait! Christ! - Good morning, Mrs. Bożenka. - Good morning. Any word of my post? Your papers are still in the publishing house. Chief has to sign them. It's just a formality. I am not worried, but redactor Winiecki... Great to see you there. Come with me. Please. What are you doing? I think I told you to leave Korton alone. Why are you afraid? It’s my personal responsibility. Bullshit! Everyone knows that I promoted you! Why the hell you called Grobny?! - How do you know? - I just know. My dear, if you want to do something on your own, go ahead. But don’t ask me to save your ass again. First of all, I thanked you a long time ago. Secondly, I want to tell you something. I’ve spent a lot of time on Korton’s case. I collected data. I talked to different people. He was not only a great writer but also an extraordinary person. He was deeply wronged. We should put it straight. We owe it to him. And I will do this. Maybe in another office. You will see! Nowhere! They won’t let you do this anywhere! I’m sorry. Funny delusions. What a Bolshevik! Stop it. In spite of all, you should do something about it. You can’t leave it like that. I don't know. By the way, my mother invites you to join us tomorrow at four o'clock. - Will you come? - Of course. What will I tell her? Nothing. Just come. Is that an office? From 8 am to 4 pm with a tea break. We are showing it in Wroclaw in a month and a half. You can't even do a scene properly. All you want is breaks. Calm down. We’ve done a pretty good job. You only think you have. We haven't really started yet. We'll never finish this thing. This is utterly hopeless. Excuse me. Wait a while. Don’t worry. Why aren’t we able to prepare such a simple performance? What’s wrong with people? Maybe they’re not motivated? But why? Everything is falling apart. We don’t have a proper vibe. People have lost their faith. And? Should we give up? Maybe we will figure this out. Mr. Tomek! Mr. Tomek! Some guy left it for you. Can you tell me his name? Tajchert. Cigarette? Tell me, please… You are an intelligent man. Is it fair? I wrote a letter to the director that we have a guy that splits at Poles, at combatants. He doesn't like our Polish patriotism. And that we must do something. You know what they did? They just moved him to another department. He’s still working. That type of guy! He spits, he yapps! And he earns more than me. Is this fair? Get out of my room. What? Get out of here. Yeah. I knew a long time ago that we had to do something with men like you. I told you to get out! Wait a minute! It’s my place. And you haven't paid for last month. Damn! There’s plenty of you around. Mum, I told you not to keep a parasite. He hasn’t paid yet! He’s a shady character. He’ll get us in trouble. He should sleep under the bridge! It's not an orphanage! - Good morning. - Hi. - He’s waiting for you. - Why here? It’s his favourite meeting place. - Have you done anything wrong? - Nothing. I spent three months in jail last year. And now he's checking me out. This tape is empty. I wouldn’t say that. Maybe some dirt. I think there is a second part somewhere. I don't want to piss him off. Where is it? That door. Mr. Tomek. Do you look at old newspapers? Sometimes. Are you interested in sport? A bit. I think you should be. Sport gives you this sense of freedom. This accumulated energy finds its way out in physical exertion instead of going in the wrong direction. Look at this photo. 1957. Would you recognize me? Were you a pole-vaulter? Don't look it, do I? I would say you don’t. But it’s true. Unfortunately... we don't eat well. By the way, you are also in the 1950s now, huh? You already know? I have to know. Anyway, news spreads quickly in this city. You know that too. I have bad feelings about the article. You especially should stay away from it. You mean my case? There’s no such thing as “your case”. You got involved in student affairs. You served your time. That’s all. I mean the opinion that is following you. They’re watching everything you do. More than in other cases. Winiecki, who once vouched for you, is now trembling with fear. You should show him some consideration. - And that tape. - What tape? You should stop filling your head with it. Maybe it’s just a fake. You can never be sure of something like that. Do you understand? So why did you call me? Look what they got here. "Skamander". I must come here more often. It's time to start doing something else. I'd like to sit here and forget about the whole world. Who knows? Perhaps soon… Don't let me keep you. You're probably in a hurry. Go then. I will stay here a bit longer. As for what I told you, think of it as advice. Friendly advice. You know I like you. Okay. - Who're you looking for? - Excuse me? Oh, it’s you, sir. Are you looking for me? Tajchert told me about you. My name is Panasiuk. That’s great. I want to talk to you, sir. About that tape, huh? Not only that. You want to talk here? - Let's go to my place. - I know a better spot. - Have you ever been to "Stylowa"? - No. And you want to write about Piotrek? All right. Let's go. If he wanted to commit suicide, he would have done it in style. With a bang! He would have crashed his car on the main street. Or he would have come up with something even better. But behind closed doors? With pills? No way! Never! Ask Żaba. He will tell you the same. - Who is the Żaba? - Żabicki. He knew him well too. We drank a lot of hooch at this table. - I'll take you to him one day. - All right. And to the others. It happened to all of us. He barely recognized us, he almost had us. Forever. Everyone. I do not know how... Do you understand that? Yes. You don't understand crap! Sorry. I didn't mean to offend you, sir. Let’s drink and make up. Okay, let's use first names. - What's your name? - Tomek. Karol, but they call me "Olo". - Hi. - Hi. Famous Panasiuk. Do you know this scum? He ended several people. You. You were supposed to become a fucking famous writer. And you... I'm talking to you, you poor relative of Lebyadkin. But he doesn't know Lebyadkin. He hasn’t heard of Dostoyevsky. And he doesn’t know much about life. What do you know about Apocalypse, you little worm? Fuck off! It gets really nasty, here. Let’s go to "Piętaszek" to finish our conversation. The bill, please. Why do you think everyone loved him? Whole Poland? Because he was independent. He did what he wanted. He didn’t ask for permission. Do you know what he did to us? We were crossing the bridge. We were all ripped, Ilona, Żaba, Piotr… And he shouted: "I bet I'll cross under that bridge to the other side." He leaned over that barrier. Be careful! No. It’s all right. What do you think? He did it, motherfucker. He was waiting for us and screaming: "Bajo Bongo! Bajo Bongo!". That’s right, my brother. You won’t find weirdos like him anymore. Piotr lived like he wrote, my brother. That was him. Damn! It’s cold. I forgot to stoke. This was his room. He used to live here for almost a year. He could live here whenever he wanted. There was no problem. He always had his own keys. You use this? - Too bad. - Who cares? He won’t come back. It’s a part of history. All right, you can take it. Come, let me show you something. Look. He filled this wardrobe in two months. He had a lot of money back then. American? That’s right. He introduced the Western-style. Anyway, he was conspicuous. He bought some of these things from people. And some of them he got for free. I am telling you... He had everything he ever wanted. Listen… Can I borrow this? Oh, no no. I won’t give you that. These are his manuscripts. Just for one day, please. I really want to write about him. I talked to people who knew him. Like who? Raisner and Iwicka. Wrong track. Ilonka cannot be objective. She will never forgive him for leaving her. And Raisner is a dick. He fucked up the film based on “Uciekinier”. I will introduce you to people who really knew him. What time is it? Nearly five. Wake me up at 10am so I can make it to the shoot. Are you an actor? Not exactly. A bit player. Damn. Winiecki wrote it? I didn’t know. Olo? Have you read it? Hey, Jimi. Finally, something’s going on. Yes? Agata. I hope I'm not disturbing you? No, I’m glad you’re here. I’m sorry. I couldn’t come. You don’t believe me? It's my fault. I don't know what's happening to me. I was fed up with everything. But I just got a second wind. I met the guy Korton had been staying with before he left. It’s crazy. That flat looks like he’s just gone outside for a while and was about to come back. I have his photos and texts. - They're getting divorced. - Who? My parents. Mother is leaving for Denmark. Father asked for a divorce. I think I should go with her. What? It’s impossible. Everything is possible. Everything. Help me. Do something. I haven’t changed much, have I? Korton almost broke my nose that day. "With broken limbs my beauteous queen". Ring any bells? “The Devils”. He loved it. He would love to follow himself. Do you want to know why did he attack me? They closed our magazine. I went to "People's Tribune". And? Nothing. He was always trying to get away from politics. But history played a joke on him. And he didn’t get away. Nor did I. - And you won't get away. - But he was a great writer. History will judge him. And for some of his colleagues, who still mean something, he was a guy who just did too many stupid things. It’s too early for him to be glorified. Maybe in a few years, when a new generation will come to power... What are you talking about?! The whole generation doesn't know who he really was. Someone must fill this gap. You didn't know that? I know a lot, but I don't believe in everything. At least officially. Goodbye. You are talking to the wrong people. Have you seen Borkowy? I don't know anyone who would introduce me to him. I will introduce you. He's a little busy. He's writing a new book. But don’t worry. I'll get it for you. What's wrong? Olo? No. Nothing. It’s okay. Let’s go. We are coming to the end of our Grand Prix quiz. A draw between Warsaw and Bydgoszcz. Last competition: ball game. Do you know the difference between ball and boxing? In the game of ball no one hits you in the face. Two players. Wait for a signal. Slalom with the ball. An athlete. He’s in the best shape of us all. Do you know he taught Piotr how to box? Yes. He does look like an educator. - What? - Nothing. I met him once. He’s not especially popular. He only runs events like this. Look who's here! - Hello. - Hi. This is Tomek Sołtan. - Have I seen you before? - Yes. In a dark staircase. Oh, it’s you? What's going on, Olo? Calm down. He’s our guy. He will write about Piotr. We must help him. I am not an orphanage. Let him fend for himself. I barely touched you. - Should I thank you for sparing my life? - Yes. - Thank you. - You’re welcome. - Be careful, he’s a tough guy. - I'll be fine. - Where? - In "Stylowa", of course. - I'll come after the broadcast. - We will be waiting for you. Faster, left, left. Faster, miss, faster… I’m sorry. Come see me someday. I'll give you a few lessons. Do you remember that scene where Kazik was fooling the road workers? I’ll try this with them. Hi guys. What's up? You work like dogs and what's in it for you? Go away. Do you know there is a denomination tomorrow? Don’t make me smash your fucking face! You don’t believe me, your problem. Non-contact. They didn’t buy it. Our nation has changed. They have no sense of humour. - Everything is changing... - Everything. Everything. Different nation. What? - We went too far, yesterday? - Yeah. How do you feel? - My head. - Take aspirin. I have to go to the shoot. Don’t forget to close the door. - Bye. - Bye. That’s how it was. They used to work together. Żaba can tell you a lot about him. Why antique shop? He was fed up with these ambiguous situations. And he stopped writing. At first, he wasn’t doing well. Here. - I talked to Borkowy about you. - And? He’s a bit sick, but he'll be happy to meet you. Let’s go. - Żaba? - Olo. It’s here. How do you like our boy? - Żabicki. - Tomasz Sołtan. - I've heard about you. - Good or bad? You sound like Piotr. You're trying to write about him. Excellent. Finally someone is... doing something about it. - Is this his fur coat? - Yes. It was lying at my house, gathering dust. Looks good on you. I have something for you. Is it true that you worked in the same editorial office? Yes, we did, sir. But you know… he immediately realized that nothing could be done there. When I realized that, it was too late. - Where's my knife? - No problem. - I can cut it. - Really? - Piotr had a similar one. - It's his. Where did you get it from? From a woman he used to live with. Ewa. Olo? Do you remember when Piotrek threatened Romek with this knife when Romek was trying to make him bleach his hair? Of course, I do. The funniest thing is that he eventually bleached his hair. - He was popular with the faggots. - They always loved him. This is true. Men loved him more than women. - He was doing well with women. - Well, not always. What are you talking about? I know best. - Did you know him later on? - It doesn’t matter. He lived at my place. He always told everything. - Don't you know he was telling fibs? - Piotr? Piotrek never lied. Never! Olo has always been besotted. He always... - You are lying! - Olo, calm down. Olo. - I'm not drinking with you today. - Sit down, Olek. Come on. Wait, I have to tell you something. About the tape? Not only that, but I have a theory about it. - Are you coming with me or not? - Yes. Then come alone one day. I’m tired of his shitty stories. All he knows is some rumours. But he’s a good guy. So why did you make a scene? To teach him a lesson. He can’t talk nonsense like that. Wait. What about this bleaching? He did it, just like that or against something? How can I know? He had different ideas. I’m sure he did it on purpose. You would have to dye your hair red. I don't think you'd like it. Come on. The editorial office is calling again. What should I say? I call them later. That’s what you said last time. They’re begging you to come. Then tell them I'll come. All right. Mr Editor. - Yes? - Quickly! Is there a fire? Mr. Sołtan, this room… What Mr. Sołtan? I don’t know. He locked himself up. How? There is no key there. Right. He used a table. They warned me many times. In the end, I was fooled. We know, you’re there, Mr. Tomek. Open the door and tell us what's going on. Mr. Tomasz! I think it would be more convenient to talk through an open door. Is this about your job? Mrs. Bożena, did you find out about Mr. Sołtan's post? I don’t know. They were supposed to talk to you. Never heard of it. If it is all about this job, there’s no need to be worried. I’ll deal with it today. Maybe, he… Are you crazy? Why would he do that? Maybe we should try with this door? But why in my office? Bloody hell! Hello! Tomek! Let’s go! Harder! What is this? A provocation? What... What for? Why? Hello. Hi. You're going out? My train is leaving. I barely recognized you. I've changed a bit, huh? Yes. But why? Don't I remind you of someone? Right. After all, you can't remember him. Does it matter? - It does to me. - But not to me. Who are you running from? From people? From me. You can run away from me. But what about the otters? - You don't understand. - And you? You took into your head that you could be like that guy. Nothing can be repeated. I don't want to repeat anything. My taxi is waiting. What about us? I'll call you when I get back. It’s you. Wait a minute. This is Piotr's coat. Where did you get it? I found it at Panasiuk’s place. Panasiuk? Maybe he had left it there before going to Paris. Who are you, shithead? By what right? Nobody wears it anymore. Get ready. The taxi is waiting. - Really? - They are already there. Life is garbage. I gotta go. Damn. I should be home earlier. - Are you afraid of your wife? - There's nothing to talk about. Did Witek teach you how to fight? I wrote a short story. Wanna hear it? Go ahead. Piotrek used to tell his stories. I'm ready. Let’s go. This guy is going to the party. The door opens... Ladies are still waiting. I haven't seen you here for a long time. I was busy. But I’ll visit you more often. It's here. - Monkeys! - Finally. Jola! You’ve recognized me? You haven't changed that much. Neither have you. You're a bit chubby. A monkey. - Maniek! Maniek! - What? - Bring it. - Sure! Sit down, girls. - How's life? - Fantastic. What kind of life is that? No surprises, just a routine. We used to have fun, huh? Those memories… And funerals have already begun. Come on, Sława. It’s not that bad. Let’s get to work. Better dirty than empty. Only a small sip for me. At the bottom. Symbolically. Come on, girls. Have you forgotten? They were drinking it like tea. It was hundred years ago. Hundred? At most ten. Does it even matter? We must celebrate our meeting. What’s the most important thing in a man’s life? Seriously? Well? A well-lit seat at the bar. The main thing is to start. Go! Bricklayer builds houses. Bajo Bongo! Bajo Bongo! Bajo Bongo! Bongo Bajo! I saw you on TV once. Come on. You looked amazing. Television is lying. Don’t you know that? The first one is for fun. Second shot makes you hot. Wanna see a pier? Buy me a beer. Pour me some Eden. We will run to Sweden. Hog. One more? No, thanks. I have to pick up my kid from kindergarten. I have a dentist appointment. Wait a minute. I haven't taken my cap off yet. We haven't even started yet. We have to arrange another date. Maybe not here. It was really nice after so many years. Yeah. Call us when you are up to something. Bye! See you! Stupid bitches! Chill. There's always other ladies. Pour the vodka. He’s doing well. He’s great. Like if he was born with a bike. How was it? Great! I take it. I just have to make some money. Publish one book and it's yours. I don’t know if Piotr ever rode a bike? He did. I saw it. He was more interested in cars. Keep it for me. I can’t help it if I find a better offer. There’ll be no better offer. Keep it for me. Just one more ride. Tomek! I’m sorry. Are going to continue to work with us? No. It seems to me that you are not yourself. Hey. Come in. Come in. They’re harassing me. I have to move out. Stay with me. You can write here. - Really? - Of course. No problem. You're a true friend, Olo. All right! Enough! You drooled on me. - Have you seen Borkowy? - No. Then it’s too late. He died last night. Too bad. In the doorway... No... The bouncer opens the door and asks: "Password?" Life is God paid in advance. Concrete darkness of a cell. More than a year in this hell. Shabby walls it’s all I see. Do you still remember me? Do you still remember me? Do you still remember me? Great! He sings nice, huh? Not bad. - How do you know it? - From Ilona. - And you know "do Santa Cruz"? - Sure. Is that what you mean? Yeah. I’m standing in the Warsaw Main, Sadness tears my heart away. Awful stench drills my brain. All I feel is the pain. Sorry, my old woman didn't want to let me go. Look what I have. Ballantine’s, yummy. Witek, stop it! You've had enough. How do you know? When “enough” is all you know. I've had enough of you! - When are you going to Ilona? - Maybe tomorrow, I don’t know. Tell her to come over. What about throwing a banquet? I’ll bring her here. It will be better this way. Definitely. A woman should listen to a man, not the other way around. I'll bring her. No problem. Olo, Can I work as an extra? No. It’s not for you. You're not the right fit. You should write. You have a talent. I really liked your last story. Let me read it. Of course, but I must clean it first. Keep playing. To Santa Cruz. To San Francisco. Rent the fastest car and leave it all behind. Come on! Show me what you got. Witek! Fight! Witek! Come on! Fight! Fight! And king! Witek! Witek! Did I hurt you? Witek! You need to grow bigger, first. I was drunk. Bullshit. I was drunk too. Look. She’s leaving. Then let her go. There’s nothing special about her. Anyway, I’m useless today. Air, you know… Stop it. Stop it? Didn’t they tell you? Ask them. The will tell you. Everything. What our beloved idol did to me. And to her. She was blinded by him. She knew nothing. And he destroyed her. And then he found another one. And he destroyed her too, but Ida... Ida... If she hadn’t done this, we could be together now. We could be happy. Since then... I can’t. I thought you were his friend. I was! Goddamn it! I was. His only friend. One of his closest. Even after what he did to me. I never disowned him. Don’t ask me why. Okay? Don’t ask me. I baked an apple cake. Don't say it's not good. I’m sure it’s great. Try it. Delicious! What do you have now in the theatre? Another shit. Forget it. I don’t have luck with directors. All my suggestions are being thrown away. What are you doing? My train is leaving. You just arrived. I don't have a performance today. I have an appointment. - With who? - It doesn’t matter. Can't you just tell me? With Żabicki. You’re lying. Whatever. When are you coming back? Maybe you'll come to me this time? It won’t be possible until next Monday. All right. Visit me next Monday. Olo wants to throw a banquet. Who knows, maybe I will come this week. Bye! This is Szczepanek. Don’t be so shy. Gentlemen want to talk to you. You don't like guests, do you? What about chocolate? Our children are not allowed to keep any products. If you want some after dinner, report to me. Would you like anything else? Don’t spoil him. They really have everything here. Why? A boy his age should have what he wants. What would you like? Are you my uncle? Yes. I knew your daddy well. Daddy is abroad. Really? He won’t come back. How do you know it? You don't know him at all. Why do you think so? If you knew him, you would know what I really need. - Can I go back to the common room? - Yes. He's a strange boy. So cold. We have some trouble with him, to be honest. What do you think he needs? I have no idea. They have everything here. On the other hand, we do our best to make sure that one child doesn’t have more than the other. I see. Was I right? He’s very like him. Did you see that? He didn't like me. He just needs some time. Next time you will buy him a toy. I’m sure it will get better. - It’s not about a toy. - So about what? I don’t know. Do you have a negative conscience with you? He asked me. Me, a desert creature who walks on scorched earth. Do you know why he asked me? Because he believed there’s no other way than to ask your own conscience. Remember, my old man, the drunk continued babbling, When they ask you what you think about freedom, answer, “To whom”? Because they are asking, “Why?". Nice. I like it. - Seriously? - Yeah. Especially this sentence. When they ask you what you think about freedom, answer, “To whom”? Because they are asking, “Why?". You have a gift... Well, I’ve worked a bit. I can see that. Listen. They won’t let this through. Too hard. You think so? I’m sure of it. You know, it's not so bad, but it’s unoriginal. It reminds me of that wave of the late 1950s. I may be wrong, but I guess it's over. I am so sorry. I would really like to print something for you, but you know, something is not right. Too bad. I read your articles, interviews, essays. I liked it. But I think that the path you are walking now leads to nowhere. We'll see about that. Well. I wish you all the best. All right, if you’re so determined… Directress would dissatisfied. Let's keep this between us. Just this once. - You want him to come out? - No, I’ll just take a look. As you like. Sir! I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. It was an accident. There you are. Is that you? I haven't changed that much, have I? So you live here now? Was it Korton’s room? Do we have anything to say to each other? I don't think so, but I just want to talk to you a bit. I knew Korton. Just a quick conversation. Nothing serious. I warned him, just like I warned you. And you both didn’t listen. And that’s how it goes. Unbearable. I’m losing my patience! Why did you come here?! How long are going to be messing around with my life? I'm sick of these conversations! Get out! - Here’s your tape. - What tape? You were looking for his tape, right? I didn’t ask you. Don’t be so scared. It’s a gift. By the way, it’s not interesting at all. I think the second part is the most interesting. Second part? What? Don’t you know that the second part belonged to Korton’s mother? I thought you knew the second fragment. I don’t want to know. And I don’t need your help. - Take it away! - I don't need it. It’s a one of the copies. There’s nothing to worry about. Oh! Do you know that I retired two weeks ago? You know what I do? I sit in the back of the library and study the old magazines. Isn’t it funny? You can say that we grew closer to each other. We turned our asses to reality. Maybe it’s the best solution? Goodbye. I probably won’t see you again. Take care of yourself. Goodbye. There is no need to rush because Werner… moderate clouds… It will clear up in the night. South-easterly wind, up to 20 km/h. S. Ch. E. Me. S. - S. - Ch. - Ch. - E. E. - Me. - Me. Scheme. Scheme. Mr. Karol, just a quick word. A bit stronger. Shout a few times. It will make an impression. And the second thing is the text. Director asked me not to change anything. The shoot will be okay, I promise. The break's almost over. Two minutes left. Olo! Hi! - Listen... - Have you seen that little shit? He's trying to teach me. I know everything about this tape. - What tape? - Piotr’s tape. The one you listened to at Tajchert's was authentic. Don't aim it at me. His last moments are recorded there. Bullshit! He would say something. Yes, if he was to commit suicide. But his death was probably an accident. - And it was recorded. - Are you crazy? There was nothing there. You will hear it. The break is over. Everyone to set, please. They’re calling us. There’s nothing interesting here, go. It's gonna be a shitty movie. The tape is authentic! Tomek, I got something interesting for you. - Hey. - Hi. - You know what this is? - Tell me. And all his songs are written here. I got it by accident. This is a sensation! I have a sensation. I discovered that the last moments of Piotr’s life are recorded on this tape. - Nonsense. - It’s true. I got another piece, and I put them together. And they matched perfectly. That Tajchert’s tape was authentic. Tomek, give it a rest. If Piotr had recorded a tape, it would have been something meaningful. I knew him. He was crazy, but we all knew that in a particular situation, he could be very strict. Take this notebook. This is my gift to you. And I hope you will sing something for us soon. A bit looser, not so officially. Hello! Hello! It’s you. I didn't recognize you. I’ve been looking for you. I told you that you would be able to write about him one day. The time has come. I would like you to be the first. Someone is going to write a play. The whole wave is coming. - Witek, I need to talk to you. - After the broadcast. Hi. Remember. It’s a great chance for you. We can help you. Some documentation, materials, you know. It’s quite obvious for you. Get to work. Do you know what's on this tape? Death. Are you asleep? Are you tired? These old pills won’t help you. They are probably 11 years old. Piotrek used to take them. If you need it, I can get it for you. Tomorrow we're throwing a banquet. A banquet. - What for? - What do you mean? In your honour. That’s what we used to do with Piotrek. There was always an excuse. I called Ilona. She will come. I see you’re awake. We'll show them again. All is not lost yet. We'll show these motherfuckers what it means to live. He was crazy. He had an imagination. He didn’t lack fantasy. Something was always going on around him. Everyone was waiting. And suddenly he did something jaw-dropping. "I lost my Eurydice!” Christ! He was a madman. Do you remember that story with cash? He came here for the first time, and he said, "Mr. Lulek, double shot, please.” I asked him: "Are you talking to me?". And I don't pour him. And he pulled out a lot of cash and said: "Give me that vodka, or I will start to throw money at people.” And I answered: "It’s your money.” And he started to throw. First, a piece of paper. And then he threw it all over. Yes. He liked to drink. Whoever drinks is alive. Whoever loves is healthy. Beautiful words. You could talk to him, even when he was drunk. Good bloke. Silence! I want to tell you something. He is dead! Don’t you get it, morons? Don't you understand that he is dead? He died! Good job, Tomek! Thank you! Let’s go somewhere else. I'm a black man. Black as your thoughts. White girls are what I hate. How sad will be their fate! I take the girl on my lap... I feel so good with you. I don't want to go back. Then stay. What about my theatre? Theatre! Drop everything. Stay with us. Everything will be real again. And you? What do you think about it? Listen… How did he do it back then? What are you doing? You don't believe that I can do this? Stop fooling around! Come back! Come on, idiot! Come back, you idiot! Are you still alive? Exactly the same. Are you there? Yes. He is quite fit. Maybe he can make it. Are you alive?! Be careful! You are drunk! It’s not that bad. Because he likes you. I told him this story about Piotr. He was really excited. You know how he did it then. He was almost unconscious from being drunk. He’s drunk too. Maybe he will make it. - Hey! - Tomek! Are you there? It’s okay. - He’s doing well. - It's not that hard. Let’s go down. I stay. - Do you see anything? - No. Ilona! How is he? Can you see anything? No. And you? Nothing. Fuck! Tomeczek! Say something! The same story again for God’s sake! Tomek, it doesn't make sense. Are you there? Calm down. Calm down! Calm down! Stay here. I’ll look down there. He is alive. He will make it. Tomek! Tomek! Come here! I found his coat. Quickly! Damn it! Tomek! And? Nothing. We’ve checked everywhere. But maybe it took him? No. We did everything we could. He can't have just disappeared. Maniek and Witek are back. He's not with you. We checked his old apartment. Nobody has seen him there for a long time. They're still looking for him. - Have you found anything? - No. Maybe he got to the other side. No, Ilonka. It won't help. Let’s go. Maybe it’s just a stupid joke? Do you remember how it was with Piotr? We were always afraid for him. And then he came back.
