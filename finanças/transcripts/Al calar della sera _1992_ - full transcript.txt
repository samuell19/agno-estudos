Few more meters, bastard! Damn bitch! Now I'll take care of you! Oh God! Here you are at last! I should cut your throat from the way you behaved. Here. I might do it anyway. Please... Shut up!

Good girl. Now go on your knees. I said go on your knees! Good. Nowtie her wrists. Good girl. Nowthe same to her ankles. Good. Let's go now! Now we have the whole night for us. I could even free you, because I knowthat you'll do whatever I tell you to do! Because if you try to escape, orto do something wrong, I'll kill your friend. And it would be like you killed her. This is your bedroom, isn't it? This is the wardrobe. Where is the bed room? I arrived just on time. You were about to leave. Why don't you leave? I'll give you whatever you want. There is money in the house. Thejewels! Take my jewels. They are in this furniture. I didn't come here forthat. I swear that if you leave, I won't sue you. I will forget your face forever. We were waiting for some friends. We had to spend the weekend with them. They'll be here soon. Maybe theirtyres are ruined, uh? Why don't you stop telling bullshit? If someone had to be here, he would have been already here. I don't think someone will bother us. It's only you and me. Very cute. Come here. Come here and show me how it looks on you. Show me how it looks on you! Fuck you! Maybe these are more beautiful. Take them and put them on! You don't have any other choice than to do what! say. Get up and putthem on. Put them on. Or I'll take care of you till you'll feel ashamed to look at yourself in the mirror. Go on! You are used to get naked! You usually do it in front of many people, it shouldn't be so difficult to do it in front of me. You are very beautiful. You are very beautiful. Please... Don't hurt me. If you behave, nothing wrong will happen to you. Now show me what you are able to do. Loosen my trousers! Touch me. Touch me! Yes, like that. Nowturn round. Tell me that you like it. Tell me that you like it! I like it. What did you prepare for your lovely husband? What did you do to him? I made sure he wouldn't bother us. No, I don't think he will bother us. lfl were you, I wouldn't hope for his help. Were you looking for these? Get off! Now you'll end just like your husband. My eyes! Damn bitch! Now, asshole, don't you dare moving! 0r you'll burn like this match. So... Show me how brave you are. I know what you are thinking. It's true. The match could burn out before it reaches you. But it could happen othenNise. It could reach you when the flame is still on. You'll burn so quickly! You wouldn't even have the time to damn the time you entered this house. So? What did you decide to do? No, don't move! Don't do it. You are not that confident now You are not so firm as you were five minutes ago. Maybe you would like to smoke a cigarette, uh? |'|| light it! Come on asshole! Take that rope! Do it slowly. Because if! only think you are doing a movement that you shouldn't, I'll throw you the match. Even if it was just an abrupt movement, and you would burn like ajerk for nothing. Move! Come on! Sit on the floor! Bastard! Tie your legs. Tight! You animal, bastard, damn! Come on! Quick! Like that, bravo! And now move! Stand up! Slowly! Crawl worm! Do it till the house! Move. Bastard! Be a good boy. Disgusting worm! Come on! How did you do that? l was a little bit lucky. Go on the floor, asshole! What are we going to do with him? Tie his hands with the phone cable. Make it tight. Here you go. I'll go to the police station. No! You don't move from here. I know howthesethings end like. You go to the police station, and you tell them everything. They come here, they'll take him with them. Then he'll be prosecuted, months will fly away, there are interrogations, and maybe suddenly a psychoanalyst appears. He starts to dig in his past, he says he had a bad childhood, that he had a bad relationship with his family. When he killed my husband... You killed him, didn't you? You killed him. Maybe you didn't know what you were doing, isn't it? Yes, it's true! ldidn'tmean to kill him! When he arrived in the garage, there was nothing else! could do. He was the only obstacle between us. I thought only about that, howl could touch you, I've always wished that. I've often seen you in town with your tight trousers, with those light skirts made of silk, it became an obsession for me. I couldn't stop thinking about it, the whole day. But you... have you ever noticed me? You don't even remember if you saw me or not. My friends knew that! liked you. They made fun of me, hey you are a grown up! You cannot fuck women only with your dreams. What are you waiting for? Haven't you seen the way she's looking at you? It was true. You often turned to me, so I thought that maybe you liked me a little. See? | provoked him! Many men think that if you wear tigh trousers, it means they can touch your ass. How many of these men will be thejury the day ofthe trial? I can see the faces ofthe intelligent women, the comments ofthe men at the bar at Sundays. She provoked him! If you wear those clothes... Those, like me, who come from the city are all bitches! Even the women, those who move from the village to the city, they surely are whores. And if something happens to one ofthem, maybe she wanted that. I'd like to make them understand that I've never met this bastard before! That's it. This would be the trial. No! l have to kill this animal! Maybe I could cut that piece of meat he has between his legs. Then I'll be sure he won't hurt anyone else! Tell her something! Tell her that she cannot kill me like that! Shut up, asshole! You don't have the right to say even a word, understood? l'll cut this thing! And then I'll make you swallow it! No! You can't kill a man like that. Even if he's done what he's done, he is not a normal person. He is sick. He has mind problems. He must go into a mental hospital and he needs help. lfyou kill him, you'll be like him. Even worst. You'll commit an homicide knowing that you are doing it. Francesca! Francesca! My love! My baby! Now mom will take you to bed. 0h Christ! Mom will be rig ht back. I'm going to kill you bastard! Paola? Paola? Come on Paola. Come on, drink it. Here you go. Like that, good girl. Drink a little bit more. Bastard! He doesn't have to run away! The car! Take my car! The keys are there, in my handbag. Damn! He escaped! He was able to run away. Take this, asshole!
