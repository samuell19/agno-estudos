[WONDROUS MUSIC] [GENTLE BIRDSONG] [WATER FLOWS] NARRATOR: From time immemorial, the ancient Ukrainian forest has harboured amazing secrets and mysteries. Behind the Dark Mountain, in the forest's heart, the Source of Life is hidden. It provides the forest and its dwellers with their power, their spark. But one winter, while the forest was fast asleep, with the guardian alone watching over it, a human broke into the forest through the passage in the Dark Mountain. It was the owner of the sawmill. He needed at least one drop from the Source of Life to save his dying newborn daughter. But then he returned and brought an army with him, hoping to take over the entire Source for himself. And so a terrible battle began that left no winners. Only losers. All humans who had trespassed behind the Dark Mountain vanished. The Forest Guardian lost all but an echo of his ancient strength. And when the forest creatures woke in the spring, they were greeted by the horrific consequences of the humans' treachery. Look at what our enemies have done. For this reason, no human shall set foot behind the Dark Mountain ever again! This is the new forest law. - [BOULDER RUMBLES] - [SOMBRE MUSIC] Many years have passed since that day. [GENTLE MUSIC] [YAWNS] Another winter is over. Oh, I've slept so long. I was having the loveliest dream. But this is better than any dream. [MUSIC LIFTS] [CHUCKLES] It's finally spring. [SQUEAKS, PURRS AND CHITTERS] [SNIFFS] [SNEEZES, THEN GASPS] [CHITTERS] MAVKA: Swampy! It's the best part of the best day of the year. Time to wake up the forest. [WONDROUS MUSIC] [ICE CRACKLES] [WATER GUSHES LOUDLY] [GRUMBLES] [MAVKA GIGGLES] [SWAMPY PURRS] [TRUMPET BLOWS] [BURBLES] [NYMPHS SIGH CONTENTEDLY] [MOOSE LOW] [BIRDSONG] Hark! Hush, the master of sounds, approaches. Happy spring, Mavka! Hush! You can fly?! That's kind of huge news. They'll call me Hush, who conquered the sky! Just don't tell Lesh. He'll think I'm stork-raving mad. [LAUGHS] [WONDROUS MUSIC CONTINUES] - HUSH: Whoa! - [BIRDS TWITTER] [VEHICLES RUMBLE AND RATTLE] [HORN BLOWS] [VILLAGERS CHANT AND PLAY UPBEAT TUNE] [RECORD SCRATCHES] [CHANTS] - [PLAYS HIGH-PITCHED SOLO] - [VILLAGERS CHEER AND APPLAUD] VILLAGER: Yeah! One more! More! And the fans go wild! We are so ready to conquer the world. Settle down, kid. Hometown crowd. Everybody knows us here. Wow, I'm just so nervous. What if things don't work out in the city? There are so many other musicians there. You have to believe in yourself, Nina, and let the music show us the way. Whatever that's supposed to mean. - [HORN HONKS] - [VILLAGERS GASP] VILLAGERS: What was that? [GRUNTS] [READS] "Big money for an important job?" Hm, not for a soon-to-be musical legend like me. But maybe Uncle Leo can use this. Lucas, your uncle, he's not feeling well. They called the healer and everything. Get home, quick. Hopefully we'll see you at the fair later. [VEHICLE HISSES AND SPLUTTERS] - Hey, look! - What is it? [MYSTERIOUS MUSIC] - [DOOR LATCH UNLOCKS] - [VILLAGERS GASP] [DARK MUSIC] Greetings, after so long, my dear fellow villagers. It is I, Kylina, the daughter and only heiress of the late sawmill owner. The one that got burned up by forest demons? Yes, my father died tragically in a forest wildfire, but it had nothing to do with your quaint superstitions. After dear Daddy's death, my mother and I left this place, but soon I became an orphan. - [VILLAGERS SIGH] - Oh, poor thing. What a shame. How positively tragic! [VILLAGERS SIGH] But now I am back to make our village prosperous again. I'm offering you all a job. You'll have so much money that you'll never have to work again. Not working is my dream job. I'll rebuild the sawmill. We'll start selling our timber all around the world. Aren't you all good and ready to become rich and happy? - Yeah! - Absolutely. - Yes! - What do you want us to do? All you have to do is pop over the Dark Mountain... - [VILLAGERS GASP AND MUTTER] - VILLAGER: What? Oh, she's cuckoo. Ugh, just like her father. But I'm talking huge money. You can't buy another life. Tell the evil spirits I said hi. - [WARBLES] - [GULPS] [CHUCKLES, THEN GASPS] - [FAINT WHIMPERING] - What's that? [CHITTERS] [CROAKS AND SNIFFS] [GRUNTS] [ROARS] Easy, easy. [SNARLS] [SNIFFS] MAVKA: What's the matter? - [CUB WHIMPERS] - [GASPS] A trap! Probably left from the old times. [GRUNTS] Huh? [CUB WHIMPERS] [CHUCKLES] [EXCLAIMS JOYFULLY] [LYNX PURRS] [SWAMPY CHITTERS] [CHUCKLES] Huh? [SQUEAKS AND SPEAKS FOREST LANGUAGE] The guardian is calling us. - LUCAS: Uh, how is he? - [BARKS] He's holding on, but my herbs can only do so much. Leo needs real medicine from the city. But... it's not going to be cheap. Uh... "Per-du-cabri-co-carum"? Just give this to the pharmacist in the city. He'll understand. Thank you. Sincerely. [DOG BARKS] Great news, Uncle. A little perdi-caca-something-um and you'll be good as new. Lucas, what are you doing? You can't waste your money on me. I'm old and I've had a good long run. Spend it on a nice girl, get settled down... [SIGHS] ..so your old uncle can die in peace. [WHIMPERS] Nobody's going to D-word. I'll find the money some... where. [CHUCKLES] Uncle, you'll be fine. I've got you. - I've got you! - [DOG GRUMBLES] [DOG BARKS] [WHINES] [JOYFUL MUSIC] [HORN HONKS] SERVANT: Oh, madam, it's your family mansion. How... rustic. KYLINA: Ugh, it's just a revolting hovel. A bunch of pathetic cowards! All my plans are at risk just because this primitive mob is terrified by the forest. - Move it, Frol! - [FROL GROANS] Oh, ma'am. Right away. Just a second. Do me a favour and get these peasant rags off me. How can they wear this hideous stuff?! Ugh, I hate it. Get rid of it right away. What a terrible piece of tasteless trash. Stupid, uneducated, superstitious mob. [GASPS] - Frol! - Oh, my God. This is so old-fashioned. [INSECT WINGS FLUTTER] Don't get me upset, Frol. It's bad for my complexion. Oh, sure, madam. - [FOOTSTEPS THUD] - Oh! [GLASS SMASHES] [BOTH GROAN] [GASPS] Clumsy idiots! Inside this case is... [GASPS] Just be careful with it. [KNOCK AT DOOR] Mm? What is it? Uh, about this job offer... Oh, forget it. KYLINA: Who's there? Frol! Oh, about THAT job offer? Please come in. Hi. My name's Lucas. It says you'll pay well. KYLINA: Hmm. Hmm. I will. If you're up to it. Uh, I am. I can do any job. Good. Eric, Derek, you go with him. [BOTH GRUNT] So... what do I have to do? Find me the tree with this leaf. Uh... Huh! In the forest behind the Dark Mountain. Hmm. FOREST-DWELLER: What happened? The guardian is summoning everybody? This hasn't happened since I was a sapling. - I'd rather take a nap. - The guardian?! [UPLIFTING MUSIC] Greetings upon the new spring, my fellow forest-dwellers. [ALL EXCLAIM SOFTLY] Is everyone here? Mavka, did you wake everybody up? [FOREST-DWELLERS MUTTER] She's probably frolicking through the crocuses with Swampy again. - [FOREST-DWELLERS CHUCKLE] - I'm sorry I'm late, Guardian. I was helping the lynx cub get out of an old trap. - How terrible! - An old trap. I thought they were all removed after the battle? Nymphs. You are the forest's armed forces. Which one of you missed this? Good job, Mavka. You've embarrassed us in front of the guardian. [WONDROUS, ETHEREAL MUSIC] [SIGHS] Now, then, listen, forest-dwellers. The Supreme Spirits of Nature whisper that dangerous times approach. Therefore, at midnight tonight, in the heart of the forest, the spirits shall choose a new guardian. Lesh, but what about you? I have so little strength left. The guardian's burden has grown too heavy for me. Lesh won't be the guardian anymore? Will the humans attack us again? - Who else can protect us? - HUSH: Hark. Hush the sky conqueror can become the guardian. Guardian chatterbox? Yeah, just what we need. HUSH: I heard that. But really, anyone can become the guardian. You mean like even you? No, no, no, Mavka. You may be the sweet, pure soul of the forest, but for this job you are just way too nice. No, I'm not. Ooh. I feel unwell. Ondina, are you alright? See? So gullible and nice! LESH: Enough! All will be decided at midnight in the heart of the forest. [FOREST-DWELLERS MUTTER] LUCAS: People say that behind the Dark Mountain, the water nymphs and tree spirits can tickle you to death. Uh, you're laughing and laughing and then bleugh! We don't believe in monsters of the forest. Where do we go from here? I think through this way. [GASPS] [WONDROUS MUSIC] [FIRE FIZZLES OUT] Uh... [GULPS] Uh-huh. I didn't think we came here to hunt. This isn't hunting. This is fun. [CHUCKLES EVILLY] - Yeah. - [GUN FIRES LOUDLY] [BISON BELLOW] - [OWL HOOTS] - [GASPS] [SWAMPY CHITTERS] Impossible. Today of all days. [BISON BELLOW] [LUCAS CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY] It was an accident. I tripped. I am extremely clumsy. My childhood nickname was Clumsy Lucas. We'll make you Clumsy Black-and-Blue-cus. [GULPS AND LAUGHS AWKWARDLY] DEREK: Mm-hm. My brother thinks you should go on by yourself. [LUCAS GROANS] If you find the tree, mark it on the map. OK. I was gonna suggest that anyway. [FAINT RUMBLING] [BIRDS TWITTER FRANTICALLY] [ANIMALS GRUNT FEARFULLY] [HUFFS AND PUFFS] I feel their fear. [RUMBLING INTENSIFIES] [FRENZIED MUSIC] [BISON BELLOW] [ETHEREAL MUSIC] [BISON GROANS] [SCREECHES] [FRENZIED MUSIC FADES] Quiet down. Everything is fine now. [SWAMPY CHITTERS] What scared you so much? [SNARLS AND BELLOWS] Humans? Here? I have to tell the nymphs. Wait. Come on, Swampy. I'll deal with the humans myself. Let's show them how 'nice' I am. [GROANS FEARFULLY] [GRUMBLES] Argh! [SIGHS] Where in the haunted heck is this tree? [RUSTLING] Believe in yourself, Lucas. Let the music show you the way. [SIGHS] Whatever that means. [PLAYS MELODIC FOLK TUNE] [GASPS] [FLUTE MELODY FADES] [ETHEREAL MUSIC] Ohh! It's so beautiful. Oh, thanks. I... Uhh... Argh! - [SWAMPY GRUMBLES] - Argh! Forest demon! [PANTS] Argh! Is the human dead? - [GROANS FAINTLY] - [SWAMPY CHITTERS] Is this some sort of human magic? HUSH: Mavka! A lot of weird, whistly, raspy sounds coming from this exact area and I... - [GASPS] - Uh, Hush. You already learned how to dismount the stork. Nice. I am on high alert. Our forest has just been incursion-ated by... Argh! THE HUMANS! I'll watch him. You go get the nymphs. Oh, no. I say we can drive the human out of the forest on our own. So I would be Hush, the first kicker-outer of humans? Oh, I like that very much. - Argh! - [GROANS] [CHITTERS] Uh... Argh! Evil spirits. Keep back, I'm warning you. I... I'm a... borscht belt in combat polka. [HUSH SPEAKS IN ECHOED TONES] Pathetic little human! You violated our sacred forest... Huh?! ..and tried to harm these noble bison. No! Super no. That was the bouncer brothers. In fact, I saved the bison from them! MAVKA: What is this, then? Oh. That's my flute. I, uh, play my music on it... with it. 'Music'? And you were doing this to try and magically enchant me in some way? No! Well, sure. Music is kind of magic, but... Wait, so you liked it, then? You do not question me, little human! Why have you trespassed here? A strange lady offered me a big reward to find a special leaf. Aha! You hear that? A reward! I knew that all humans were selfish and greedy! - Why you little... - [SWAMPY YOWLS AND HISSES] - Ouch. - [BELLOWS] [ALL EXCLAIM] HUSH: You see this! Human treachery! Huh? Wow! You are the most amazingly beautiful demon I have ever seen. Your eyes. I am not a demon. I am Mavka, the soul of the forest. Well, I'm Lucas. The soul of... myself? Look, I can explain. I need that reward to buy medicine for my uncle Leo. No. I have been warned that humans are skilful liars. You have broken the law of the forest and I expel you! No expulsion necessary. I'll leave myself. Just let me find this silly leaf first or else my uncle... ..dies. How awful. I'm so sorry. - [SWAMPY CHITTERS] - Whargh! [LAUGHS] Hey there, little... What are you? This is Swampy, the last of the kittyfrogs. LUCAS: Awww! It's so cute how much he hates me. - [GROWLS] - Oh! You want something super yummy? [SNIFFS] [LUCAS LAUGHS] Had a feeling you'd like that. You're very different from the evil humans in all the forest legends. [MYSTERIOUS MUSIC] [OWL HOOTS] [WIND HISSES FAINTLY] [NYMPHS CHUCKLE] [BROTHERS GRUMBLE] - [FAINT RUSTLING] - Huh? [SQUEAKS] Huh? [GROANS] Derek, hold my boomstick. Derek? [OWL HOOTS] ERIC: Derek? Where are you? HUSH: I'll teach you, you filthy human! Hush, what are you doing? Swampy, spit it out immediately! This grotty fleshbag is trying to poison you. Hey! It's my mother's recipe. HUSH: Oh, Mommy poisons folks too, huh? [LUCAS AND HUSH GROAN] MAVKA: Hush, stop! Lucas, leave him alone. - Huh? - You gave it a name already? [HUSH WARBLES AND TRUMPETS] - [LUCAS GROANS] - [GRUMBLES] Lucas. Stop it right now! [VOICE ECHOES] [THUNDER CRACKS] Well, he started it. He has to leave. I need the leaf. Fine, here's a leaf. Now leave. Not this one. Are all humans this picky? Lucas. It's not the leaves you really need. You need to heal your uncle and I'll give you the cure he needs. LUCAS AND HUSH: Really?! Oh, thank you. You are so nice. Hey, hey, hey. Do you really want to break the law to help a human on such a day? You heard him. He saved the bison, and for some reason... I believe him. - [INSECT BUZZES] - Urgh! After all, the soul of the forest must help all the living creatures in the forest, right? And Lucas is a living creature who is in the forest. - Huh? - Therefore, I have to help him. And you will help me help him. Me? No way! Never! Never, never, never, never, never, never, never! - No! - [BIRDS WINGS FLAP] When will I learn that I'm incapable of saying no to you? Don't worry, Hush. We'll make it before the ceremony starts. I'll give Lucas the cure for his uncle and... And then he'll leave the forest forever. I promise. Hmm? [ONDINA'S VOICE ECHOES] Come to me! Don't be shy. Come closer. Ahhh! [FROG CROAKS] [ONDINA CHUCKLES] [COCKS GUN] [CHUCKLES AND GASPS] Huh? [SCREECHES] Argh! - [SCREECHES] - [SHRIEKS] [MUMBLES] How did I... Curses! [SCREECHES] - [HICCUPS] - [SCREECHES] - [WATER BUBBLES] - Uh... Oh. [HICCUPS] Mm. Huh? [DEREK GROANS AND SCREAMS] Mavka, how can I thank you for your help? Just tell me and I'll do it with pleasure. Maybe you could play your music for me? Oh. Sure thing. [DISTANT SCREAMING] No, no, no, not now. Nobody can know you're here. No, let him play. The nymphs will hide him safely in the forest, one piece here, one piece there.

As soon as my uncle gets better, my musician friends and I are leaving for the big city. "The big city". What is the big city? It's a place where everything is made of bricks and stone and there are as many buildings as there are trees in the forest... HUSH: Hurry up, hurry up. Move! LUCAS: What are you doing? Back off, shrubby. Hush! Mavka! Are you the ones making all this noise? [GULPS] Too late. Nice knowing you, Mavka. Up until today, anyway. Lesh, how's it going? Busier than I'd like. Who is your guest? Uh, I'm... Hush's... cousin. [LAUGHS SHEEPISHLY] Yes, dropped by for a visit from overseas. [CHUCKLES] Right, Hush? [CHUCKLES] Uh-huh. A very, very many-times-removed cousin. Shmucas is his name. Ah! Welcome, friend Shmucas. [CHUCKLES] Come quickly. The ceremony is about to begin. Oh, great. What do we do now? Do you realise how illegal this is? We just need to keep our distance from the new guardian. As soon as the ceremony is over, I'll come up with something. FROL: You look just like your parents, madam. Hm, much better now. Yeah. Lovely portrait. Totally... horridness. Hmm? [BROTHERS MOAN] Hmm. Did you find the tree? So what stopped you? Bunnies? Squirrels? The forest demons? [HICCUPS AND CHUCKLES] FROL: Knuckleheads. Totally useless. Oh! Stop being such fools. You are stupid idiots. What am I paying you for? And where is the boy? [GRUNTS] Oh! - Out of my way. - [EXCLAIMS] Oh! Oh, damn! I'm running out of time. And where is this peasant loser? [FOREST-DWELLERS MUTTER] Ohhh! Oh! [CHITTERS IN FOREST LANGUAGE] [BOTH CHUCKLE] - Hey. - [MEOWS] Shhh! It is time. Hmm! Oh! That's the... The Supreme Spirits of Nature, I summon you. The One Who Dwells in the Earth, I call on you. The One Who Moves the Waters, I call on you. The One Who Flies with the Wind... ..the One Who Sits on the Rock... ..I call on you. Those who protect us, those who help us, those who dwell at the Source of Life, please choose the new guardian. [INTENSE MUSIC] [GASPS] Mm. Hmm? SPIRIT: The guardian is chosen. [GASPS] Huh? - Her? - Me? What's happening? Is it good or bad? Please close the knothole on the front of your face. Lesh, why me? I can't possibly be the guardian. I have to tell you something. The Supreme Spirits are wise, and they know who is capable of protecting our realm. Now the Supreme Spirits will bestow their powers on the chosen one. [WONDROUS MUSIC] [WIND WHISTLES] [WONDROUS MUSIC CONTINUES] [FOREST-DWELLERS GROAN AND EXCLAIM] [GENTLE MUSIC] - Incredible. - Perfect. So how do we "keep our distance from the new guardian" now? Mavka, you are now granted the powers of the Supreme Spirits of Nature. It is for you now to always remember that our enemy - the humans - are out there. Defend this fragile, sacred place with your very life. Please welcome our new guardian of the Source of Life and the forest. [WONDROUS MUSIC CONTINUES] That was just... whoa! Our little Mavka is now the guardian. I always knew this would happen. [SCOFFS] There has got to be some mistake. Why did the spirits not choose the strongest one? With her as guardian, our forest is more in danger than ever. Hey. Easy there, friend. Who are you supposed to be? Me? I am, uh, Hush's cousin. You... [SNIFFS] You stink like a human. Yeah, he stepped in some human on the way here. Uh, Cousin Shmucas. If he's a noise keeper, I'm the new guardian of the forest. And we all know... - ..I'm not. - [FOREST-DWELLERS GASP] - [GASPS] - Uh... oops. Human?! Run. Move your footsticks. You treacherous human. You have tricked me! - Human? - Oh, no, he's a human. Don't let him get away! Am I the only one here who's completely confused? LESH: Hush! You've got a great deal of explaining to do. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Argh! [SPLUTTERS] - Huh? - [SCREECHING] Argh! [FOREST-DWELLERS MUTTER] [SIGHS] [SNARLS] Argh! [NYMPHS SHRIEK] Argh! [SCREAMS IN SLOW MOTION] Argh! - Mavka. - Get on, quick. The lynx will take you home. Whoa! Sounds safe. [CHUCKLES] Nice... kitty. Take this. It will heal your uncle. Thank you. - Huh? - [FOREST-DWELLERS APPROACH] There's no time. Go... and never return. Death is the only thing for a human to seek here. - Go! - Wait! I promised I'd play for you. Where is he? Where's the human? He got away. What? How did he... You helped him? You have the powers of the guardian at your disposal, you could have - no, you should have - stopped him. The guardian doesn't need your help deciding how and when to use her powers, Ondina. Mavka, this human is no different than all the others. He will betray you. And when he does, we will all pay the price. Hmm. Frol! Yes, madam? There's something about this boy Lucas I don't trust. Watch him. I'm not so sure he came back from the forest empty-handed. Me?! Madam, I am a fashion tsar in the making, not a spy. Oh, that's too bad. If I get what I want, I could establish you as the number one fashion god... ..in the world. With my own Soul of Frol Manly Lace Boutique? With a global chain of whatever insane thing you just said. Then, if you need a spy, why, Frol is your guy. [CHICKENS CLUCK] Ugh. Uh! Silks, ribbons and laces don't have to be disgraces. That's the Soul of Frol. [CHICKENS CLUCK] No. This really happened to me. Last night. The forest is full of - not demons - but creatures. And they are not fond of us at all. Except Mavka. She is very nice. Danger or no, I have to go back to the forest to Mavka, to thank her. Lucas, look, if you've been at the village fair all night long and plan on going back, you can just tell me. Busted. You know me. Party animal. Best carnival ever. [HEN AND ROOSTER CLUCK] [ROOSTER CLUCKS ANGRILY] - [KNIFE BLADE RINGS] - FROL: Mmm! [CLUCKING CONTINUES] So how is this, uh, perdi-caca-something-um supposed to work? I have less than no idea. - [MUSIC DISTORTS] - Huh? [WHIMPERS] Uncle? [WHIMPERS QUIZZICALLY] Whoa! Hah! And no pain. I haven't stood this straight in 20 years. It's a miracle. [LAUGHS] [SQUEALS] It is a miracle. It's a miracle of perdi-caca-something-um. I've got so much energy. Now I'll be Hercu-Leo. Hey, let's take up curling. - [DOG BARKS] - [LEO CHUCKLES] [GROANS] [GASPS] [CLUCKS QUIETLY] [FROL LAUGHS EVILLY] [GIGGLES TRIUMPHANTLY] - [ROOSTER CLUCKS] - [KNIFE BLADE RINGS] [GULPS] - [ROOSTER CAWS] - [SCREAMS] FROL: Cock-a-doodle-doo. Cock-a-doodle-doo. Yeah, it's bit more complicated now. But, Swampy, think for yourself. How can he play his beautiful music without his flute? We have to return this to Lucas. What if something happens in the forest while I'm gone? What if nothing happens while I'm here? You're absolutely right. I'm the guardian now. I can't leave the forest. Humans are enemies. I somehow managed to live without Lucas before. Or his music. Or his eyes. Or his smile. Or this feeling that now lives right here. [SIGHS] [PLAYS SINGLE NOTES] [GRUNTS] [EAR POPS] - [SIGHS] - [FINGER SQUEAKS] Hmm. Mmm. Madam! Madam! Where's Madam? - [STAMMERS] - [GUNSHOT BLASTS] - [CHANDELIER THUDS] - [GRUNTS] [SPITS, LAUGHS] - [BANGS PIANO] - [GROANS SOFTLY] [GASPS] Madam is probably upstairs. - [WARDROBE CLATTERS] - Gah! [LIVELY MUSIC] Madam! Madam! Madam, you were right! [PANTS, GULPS] [SPITS] Eugh! - [EXHALES] - [ATOMISER SPRAYS] That icky boy lied to you! Here. [GASPS] Oh. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] Lucas was at the Source of Life. The heart of the forest. And I also found this. Finally it will be mine! [GASPS] But... but there is nothing marked here! Now think! Did Lucas say anything about the tree? [STAMMERS] No! Nothing about the tree, but he just said he will go into the forest again to see the nice forest. The magma! Boy, what a fool. It doesn't make sense. The nice forest magma? Yeah, that's what he said. He probably wants to keep the source to himself. - Frol. - Yes, Madam? - Keep an eye on this boy. - [CLICKS FINGERS] When he decides to go to the forest, we need to keep him company by all means. [SINISTER MUSIC] [BIRDS SING] MAVKA: But on the other hand, as the guardian, shouldn't I learn as much about our enemies as I can? If Lucas isn't evil, maybe other humans aren't evil either. [CROAKS] Oh, stop croaking about the law of the forest! Maybe it's time for things to change so that the forest-dwellers and humans could live in peace. Oh! [ROOSTER CROWS IN DISTANCE] [DOG BARKS IN DISTANCE] [SWAMPY CHIRPS] [ENCHANTING MUSIC] [BISON LOWS] [SIGHS] Uhh, no! I can't show up looking like this. - [PURRS] - Hm! - [GIGGLES] - [SCREECHES] Huh? Gotta find something a human would wear. [ROOSTER CROWS IN DISTANCE] [PURRS] [LAUGHS] [CROAKS, YOWLS] [CHIRPS] [PURRS] [SQUEAKS] [WHINES SOFTLY] - [CROAKS SOFTLY] - [WHINES CURIOUSLY] [GROWLS, SNIFFS] - [CROAKS] - [WHIMPERS] [BARKS] [CROAKS] [BARKS] Hey, boy. I'm making a gift. [BARKS] Yes, Dot, Mavka is going to love me. Uh, it! It. [CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY] - [SCREECHES] - [DOT GROWLS] And... done. [BARKS] [WHIMPERS] - Hey, where are the pies?! - [WHIMPERS] [SWAMPY LAUGHS] [CHUCKLES] Pie-demolisher! - [WHINES SOFTLY] - It's fine. I'm not perfect either. For instance, I'm about to break my promise to Hush and the forest law in order to keep my promise to Mavka. - [GASPS] - [MAVKA GASPS] Mavka, are you here? Your hair! How are you here? Aren't you happy to see me? No. I mean, yes! Heart-burstingly happy, which is a thing I probably shouldn't say out loud. [GIGGLES SOFTLY] Oh, is this your nest? [CHUCKLES] I prefer to think of it as a cave. Is this for making music too? [LAUGHS] - [TOOLS CLANG] - Uh, no. [CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY] Those are regular instruments, not musical instruments. I've come to return your flute. It was broken, but I... Here. Thank you. [UPLIFTING MUSIC] Now you can go to the stone forest and follow your dream. Just play for me one last time and then I'll leave. No. No, don't leave! Uh, I have an idea. I'll play even better music for you. There's a festival in town and my band is playing. Let's go! - Uh... - [CHUCKLES] Don't be afraid. It'll be good for guardian of the forest to know more about us humans, right? Uh... - You're gonna love it. - [GIGGLES] [DELICATE CHIMING] [COW MOOS IN DISTANCE] [ENCHANTING FOLK MUSIC] [PIG SNORTS] [VILLAGERS CHATTER INDISTINCTLY] [GASPS] Huh? [GIGGLES] Mavka, let's find you an outfit that says, "I am a non-alarming local human." What's wrong with this one? Well, it kind of screams, "Howdy, I'm a barely disguised forest demon "from behind the Dark Mountain." [GASPS] Oh! [ELECTRONIC FOLK MUSIC] [SIGHS] [ELECTRONIC FOLK MUSIC CONTINUES] [MAN GASPS] Oh. - [GOAT BLEATS LOUDLY] - Oh! - Hm? - [BOTH LAUGH] - [BOTH GRUNT] - [KNUCKLES CRACK] [PURRS, MEOWS] [CROAKS, PURRS] - And this is my uncle Leo. - Oh! He's the one you saved with your gift. [HAMMER CLANGS] [SCULPTURE HISSES] - [STOMACH RUMBLES] - [GASPS] Hm? [LAUGHS] [BOTH GIGGLE] [GASPS] What have you done? [BAND PLAYS LIVELY FOLK MUSIC] Oh!

[MUSICIANS SING] - [MAN TRUMPETS MELODY] - [WOMEN TRILL RHYTHM] [LUCAS LAUGHS] [LIVELY FOLK MUSIC CONTINUES] [MAVKA GIGGLES] - [MUSIC STOPS] - [VILLAGERS LAUGH AND CHEER] This music, the dancing - how delightful! But you still play better than anybody else. MARCO: He was born that way! So, Lucas, Uncle Leo is recovered. He looks better than you now. Isn't it time to show your talent to the big city? Um, well... Or has the music shown you a different way? A very beautiful way. Well, your call, Romeo. We're always happy to have you with us. Pack up. We gotta go. Oh, that's right, it's late. I must go too. Thank you for the wonderful time and for the gift. Wait! I haven't fulfilled my promise yet. [PLAYS MELODIC FOLK TUNE] [DELICATE CHIMING] - Look! A demon from the forest! - [VILLAGERS GASP] [GASPS] - She's glowing! - Green hair! An evil spirit from behind the Dark Mountain! WOMAN: What shall we do? She's come to kill our lovey ones and destroy our food crops! No! It's not true! FROL: This lad is trying to protect the demon. She has bewitched him. - She'll put a curse on us. - [VILLAGERS GASP] Get her! No! She won't hurt anyone. [VILLAGERS GASP AND EXCLAIM] [MAVKA GASPS] - Lucas! - [LUCAS GASPS] MAVKA: No! - [GROWLS] Hm... - Argh! [VILLAGERS GASP] - [LUCAS GRUNTS] - [SHOVEL THUDS] - [GROANS] - [SHOVEL CLANGS] [SHUDDERS] - [GRUNTS] - [BLOW THUDS] MAVKA: Let me go! Lucas! What do we do? - Burn her, right? - No, they drown witches! Let's do both! My fellow villagers, I was wrong. The evil spirits of the forest are very real. And now I see that it was her kind that burned up my father, the goodly sawmill owner. MAN: How dare she! But fear not! My eyes are open now and I will find out what the demons have in store for us, be it plague... - [VILLAGERS GASP] - ..drought... - [VILLAGERS GASP] - ..famine, fire or flood! And where the Source of Life is. [DELICATE CHIMING] - [TORCH HISSES] - Oh! - [VILLAGERS GASP] - What is this?! - What's happening? - Black magic! [YOWLS] [SCREECHES] [MUFFLED YELLING] - [BOTH GROAN] - [MAVKA GASPS] - Argh! - [HISSES, YOWLS] [GASPS] [SCREAMS] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [BLADE RINGS] KYLINA: Don't let her get away! [GROWLS] [PANTS] - [CHIMING, CREAKING] - [VILLAGERS GASP] [LESH GRUNTS] - Lesh! - [ROARS] [VILLAGERS SCREAM] [LESH GROANS] - [SWAMPY SCREECHES] - [LESH GROANS] [VILLAGERS EXCLAIM] - MAN: Where'd he go? - WOMAN: Is he gone? All is lost! My strong silks, my robust ribbons, my manly laces, the Soul of Frol - gone! [BOTH GROAN] Oh! It isn't over yet, my whiny little pet. My poor, dear, terrified fellow villagers, we underestimated the demon's power and the results were tragic. - [STALL RUMBLES] - [VILLAGERS GASP] But this is not the end. They'll soon be back! - Oh, no! What do we do? - Oh, this is terrible! There's only one way to stop this evil. Strike first! [THUNDER CRACKS, RUMBLES] [SOBS] Lesh, how did you find me? Hush told me everything. I don't understand what's happening. Those humans... Calm down now. Those humans obviously conspired to lure you into a trap. I love how no matter where you look, you see goodness, Mavka, but you have made the same mistake I made once in trusting a human. Lucas would never do that. I'm sure he can explain everything. [GROANS] - Mavka!? - [MICE SQUEAK] [GRUNTS] [MICE SQUEAK] [GROANS] Now, Lucas, be a good boy of limited intellect and integrity and mark the Source of Life on this crudely drawn map. Never gonna happen, lady. Somebody found a backbone! Let's see if we can't just melt it like meringue. Ooh, I'm peckish. [MUFFLED CRIES] Oh, no! [DELICATE CHIMING] Don't touch her! The source... - [WHIMPERS] - ..or she dies. [TENSE MUSIC BUILDS] Now let Mavka go! Sure thing, ding-a-ling. Oh, Lucas! Smooch, smooch, swoon! Oh, you saved me! You saved me! You're so, so dumb. [LAUGHS] No! Kylina, you won't get away with this! - Ah! Ah! - [KYLINA LAUGHS] Really? Guess I'll just stop, then. Have a nice swim, sweetie! [PIPES CREAK] So much water has flowed past since that fateful day, the time has come for me to tell the full truth. The battle all those winters ago - I've never told anyone the reason why it happened. [WIND HOWLS] The sawmill owner came to me in tears. He was begging me to save his newborn daughter... ..and I believed in goodness in him. I gave this human a drop from the Source of Life itself. Soon, he returned with... ..well, with an army of humans. They wanted the Source of Life for themselves. So, I called for the Supreme Spirit of the Underworld, the One Who Sits in the Rock, to give me the Spark of Rage. And, may all those I love forgive me, he did. Everything good in me was replaced by sheer rage. I burned and the world burned. Humans and the forest alike. Fire and hatred without end. Have you seen Lucas? Have you seen my boy, Lucas? [CONDESCENDINGLY] Oh! Your boy's been taken by the evil forest demons. - Huh? - Stings, right? But you can still save him if you join us. Take the weapon, old man. I'm on a schedule here! You stay here and make sure nobody finds the boy... ..unless you were just dying to be in the battle? [CHUCKLES CONDESCENDINGLY] This is for our home! [QUIETLY] And my youthful skin. [LOUDLY] Now let's go eradicate those demons for the good of all we hold dear! - Yes! - Yes! Death to the demons! Start the forest killer! [POWERFUL MUSIC] [ENGINE ROARS] [ALL CHITTER IN FOREST LANGAUGE] Humans are preparing to attack the forest. Uh! Hey! Somebody! Anybody! Hey! [SIGHS] [MICE SQUEAK] [GRUNTS] [DOG BARKS IN DISTANCE] Dot? Dot, is that you? [BARKS] Good boy! Run! Find someone to help me! Hurry! [BARKS] [CHAINSAW BUZZES] So, that's it. War is here. The sawmill owner's daughter... [GASPS] I know what to do! What? Decorate their axes with flowers? I know what we all need to do - fight! No! There's another way! I am the guardian and this is my call. Wait here. - [SCOFFS] - Don't look at me. She is the guardian. [ENGINE ROARS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [VILLAGERS SHOUT OVER EACH OTHER] [DELICATE CHIMING] [WIND WHISTLES] [KYLINA GRUNTS] [FOREST KILLER CREAKS] What's going on? Whoa! [ENGINE RUMBLES] MAVKA: Please stop! [GASPS] Hm. I might've frightened the people at the fair, but the forest means no harm to humans. We can live in peace and even help each other. "Help each other"? A long time ago, the forest gave a drop from the Source of Life to the owner of the sawmill so he could heal his sick newborn daughter. The forest saved you! What? Nobody ever told me! It is the truth. [LAUGHS] The truth? The truth is the sawmill owner never had a daughter, but he had a beautiful wife that came up with a tragic story about a little sick daughter. My husband was obedient but weak. He only got me the one lousy drop that kept me young and fit for all these years. But how does this make us enemies? Oh, you'll never understand this. Look at you! You're Nature's queen, glowing and gorgeous forever! You don't know nothing about crow's-feet, turkey neck, back fat. You'll never get old and saggy and shrivelled. But I can give you one more drop. That is so nice of you, but, see, if I get hold of the entire Source of Life, I will not only be young and beautiful forever, but it'll also make me the richest, most powerful woman ever. But without the Source of Life, the forest will die. It's gonna die one way or the other, honey, so why not just get out of my way? Hm. [TENDRILS RUMBLE] Not all humans are as cruel and selfish as you are! Oh, you're thinking about that lad of yours? Lucas? Huh? [TENDRILS CREAK] Do you have any idea where he is? - [GASPS] - [CHIRPS] I... [GASPS] I'll tell you another truth, sister. I paid Lucas very well so he would find the source and lure you into the village. - Huh? - He took his money and left. To the city? Exactly. Oh. - [VILLAGERS EXCLAIM] - [TENDRILS RUMBLE] And one more thing. Lucas told me it was almost too easy to fool you because you're just so nice. Oh. [ENGINE STARTS] Now get out of my way and take your freaky woodland zoo with you! [SAW GRINDS, CLAW CLANGS] [MAVKA SCREAMS, GRUNTS] [HUSH AND SWAMPY GASP] Mavka! I knew we couldn't trust that Shmucas! I got it so wrong, Hush. Humans really are all evil. Lucas is... HUSH: Huh! Huh! [BEASTS ROAR] [SCREECHES] [VILLAGERS SHOUT] [NYMPHS SCREECH DEMONICALLY] [ROARS, GRUNTS] [CHAINSAW BUZZES] [STUMP GROWLS] [CHAINSAW BUZZES] - [SCREAMS] - [TREES ROAR] [BARKS] [BARKS] [BARKS] [WHIMPERS] [WHIMPERS] [SAW SQUEALS] Who are you, friend? [BARKS] You're saying Shmucas didn't betray us?! [BARKS] - Do you believe him? - [CROAKS] Then I have an idea. Mm! Frol Style! Madam is going to love it! - [SIGHS] - [EAGLE SCREECHES IN DISTANCE] Huh? [GASPS] [DOT BARKS] [STORK CALLS] Well? Where's our hero? - [HUSH GASPS] - [SCISSORS CLICK] Hm! Hm! Go get Shmucas and I'll deal with this one. - [GRUNTS] - Huh? Hm! [GRUNTS] Argh! I will slice you into robust little ribbons! [PANTS] - [CROAKS] - [BARKS] LUCAS: Dot? [BANGS ON DOOR] [INHALES DEEPLY] [WHINES] [MEOWS SOFTLY] Get back here, you rotten cabbage! [YELLS] [BOTH GRUNT] FROL: Oh-ho-ho! You have awakened the beast now! Knock, knock! Anybody home? [BELLOWS] [SNORTS] [GRUNTS] Ooh! [GRUNTS] [STUMPS GROWL] [LAUGHS COCKILY] [GRUNTS] [CHAINSAW BUZZES] - [VILLAGERS CHEER] - [LYNX ROARS] [PANTS] [GASPS] [WHIMPERS] - [CHATS SWEETLY] - Hm. [DOT GROWLS] [AIR BUBBLES RUMBLE] [BAR SCRAPES] [WHINES] [WHIMPERS] [WHINES, BARKS] - [YOWLS] - [GROANS] [GASPS] Am I glad to see you! [GROANS] Ooh! [BREATHES WEAKLY] Oh-oh-oh! Huh? Oh! - [VILLAGERS SHOUT] - [GASPS] - [BISON BELLOWS] - [CHAINSAW BUZZES] - [VILLAGERS SHOUT] - [NYMPH HISSES] [MOOSE BELLOWS] [BOAR SNORTS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Hm. [DELICATE CHIMING] [GROANS] [TENDRILS CREAK] [SIGHS] [DELICATE CHIMING] [GROANS] [PANTS] [SIGHS] [ROARS] So, that's where you're hiding, you rotten old stump! [LAUGHS] [GRUNTS] This is all my fault. I have to stop this. [DELICATE CHIMING] Supreme Spirit, the One Who Sits in the Rock, I call on you! No! Mavka, don't! [THUNDER CRACKS] [ETHEREAL MUSIC] You have called me, Guardian. I beg you, give me the strength to answer my calling. I need the Spark of Rage to protect the forest. The Spark of Rage has its price. The price paid by the previous guardian was his enormous strength. The rage burned him out from the inside. And you, the Spark will cost you your life. You shall enter the Nothingness for eternity. I agree, for this treacherous feeling here, now it brings only pain. As you wish, Guardian. Ondina was right. I was too nice. - [SPARK ROARS] - [GRUNTS, PANTS] [THUNDER BOOMS] [POWERFUL MUSIC] [SIGHS] [FLAMES ROAR] - [TORNADO BOOMS] - [VILLAGERS SCREAM] Whoa! [GRUNTS] [FLAMES CRACKLE] - [CHAINSAW BUZZES] - [FROL LAUGHS MANIACALLY] I forgot to mention... I've got you now, weed-face! ..I'm allergic to chainsaws! - [GROWLS] - [WAILS] [LUCAS GRUNTS] [FROL GRUNTS] Hush, you alright? Oh, Shmucas! I'm fine. Got some yellow spots, but, overall, fine. - [FROL SHRIEKS] - Huh? [SHRIEKS] [WAILS] This village has the worst aura! - [CHAINSAW BUZZES] - [WARDROBE CRASHES] [ROOSTER CROWS] Hush, please, I need to find Mavka! What the hometown hurricane is that?! It seems that IS Mavka. [POWERFUL MUSIC] [VILLAGERS SCREAM] Oh! [SCREAMS] [PANTS] [GROANS] - [POLE CRACKS] - Whoa! [LUCAS AND HUSH PANT] Mavka! It's me, Lucas! I'm here! Argh, I've got to get closer! I might be able to help with that. [STORK CALLS] Thank you, dear cousin. Ha! They'll call me Hush, who first befriended humans. Uh... uh... Whoa! - [BLEATS] - Whoa! Mavka! It's me! Please! You have to stop! Aah! [GRUNTS] Whoa! Aah! Oh! - [GRUNTS] - [STORK TRILLS] - [BLEATS] - Oh! Where are you going? You're gonna die! I don't care. I have to save her. There's nothing you can do. She can no longer understand your words. Do you copy? What did you say? I said she can't hear your words! Run! Hush, you are a genius! Finally I can scratch hearing that off my bucket list! She can't hear my words, but what if... [PLAYS MELODIC FOLK TUNE] [GROANS] [HOWLS] I got it! I got it! They need our help. [VILLAGERS SING TO MUSIC] We should all do this together! [GASPS] [DELICATE CHIMING] [GRUNTS] [SCREAMS] [SCREAMS] [BLAST HOWLS] [SOFT ETHEREAL MUSIC] Mavka, it's me. Hear me, please! [SIGHS SOFTLY] [MEOWS SADLY] [SIGHS] Come back to me. Please! [SORROWFUL MUSIC] [SINISTER MUSIC] [THUNDER BOOMS] MAVKA: Is this what Nothingness feels like? SUPREME SPIRIT: This is the place of no phantom dreams, where no songs are carried by the wind. The fire of hate and rage does not burn here. MAVKA: Rage doesn't burn in my heart anymore. I heard his voice and now I know he never betrayed me. SUPREME SPIRIT: You have chosen to spare the lives of the humans who have caused you so much pain. MAVKA: But they also gave me something I've never felt before. SUPREME SPIRIT: We have made the right choice making you the new guardian. You have bridged the gap between the humans and the forest-dwellers, but now you have to pay the promised price and remain in the Nothingness forever. For eternity. [SILENCE] MAVKA: No. I'm alive and I will live on forever because now my heart is full of something that will never die. [EMOTIONAL MUSIC] [ALL EXCLAIM] Through the darkness, I heard your music. It filled me here. Your music is the real magic. No. The only magic humans have is love. [UPLIFTING MUSIC] [VILLAGERS AND FOREST-DWELLERS EXCLAIM SOFTLY] [GENTLE FOLK MUSIC] Uh?
