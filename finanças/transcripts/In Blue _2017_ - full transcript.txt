Does everyone have their FSQRC ? We have a flight to Bucharest. Cabine is ready. - Miss, can I have a red wine ? - Sure, I'll bring it in a minute. 41D is indisposed. Excuse me, please ? Madam ? Can you hear me ? Madam ? - Nationality ? - Dutch. Name ? - How far along is she ? - I don't know. Her waters broke. Ask for medical assistance. And look on the iPad. I want her name and details. Tim, tell the cockpit and have them turn on the seatbelts. Sir, are you a doctor ? Can you please sit down ? I'm going to move you a little bit. Very good. Medical kit. Madam, I'm going to put you down here. - No doctor or midwife on board. - Cockpit on the line ? - Yes. - How long till the landing ? How long till the landing ? - We're over the Alps. - So ? Fifty minutes until Otopeni Airport. - It says her name is Judith Koppel. - Judith. She's 31. Her pregnancy statement says she's 35 weeks along. Tim, read it aloud. Astrid, a glass of water. Tim ? One: call for assistance. Two: Determine the stage of the... Go on. The area around the vagina will bulge out until you see the top of the baby's head. Thanks. Judith ? Judith, look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Good. Good. I'm Lin. We'll do this together. OK ? Squeeze. Good. It's coming, it's coming. Come on. No, no, no. I can see the head. Come on. Very good. One more time. Very good. One second. - Am I interrupting ? - No. We're going dancing in this terrible club. - Feel like coming ? - Yes. I think you did a great job. I really do. Yes, we did earn our money. - Everything OK ? - Yes. I'm going to freshen up. See you later. Hi, it's me. Lin. - Thomas, can you hear me ? - You woke me up. Shit. Sorry. Of course. Why are you calling ? No, nothing. Go back to sleep. I... I was thinking of you. A baby was born on-board. I was thinking of you. - Bizarre. - Yes, very bizarre. OK, sorry. Sleep well. Everything OK there ? - Are you still in Chengdu ? - Yes, everything's fine. Sleep well. OK, sleep well. As if you're floating through space. Thanks, sweetie. So I jumped. When I opened my eyes, I was hanging upside down. On a string of elastic, by my ankle. No weightlessness, no eternity. Just empty, boring. Oh, sorry. - You have to go. - What ? I can't sleep with someone beside me. Seriously ? Crap. Yes, I'm on my way. Crap. Yes, it sucks. Sorry. I don't have a clue. Probably the alarm clock. Yes, it's annoying. I'm jumping into a cab now. No, I'll make it. Definitely. Stop ! Taxi ! Otopeni airport. But very fast. Faster, more money. Okay, go. Fuck you ! What are you doing ? Don't stop, just go, go, go. I've got 25 minutes. Stop ! Wait. Wait here, it's dangerous. What are you doing ? Call an ambulance. He jumped. He wants money. Are you okay ? Yes ? Yes, I know. No, I'll still make it. Give him some money. Then we'll get your airplane. Here. This is my number, okay ? Are you cold ? No. No, no, okay. Thank you. Thank you. You smell nice. I'm Nicu. Lin. No, don't delay. I'm so sorry. Yes, it's... No, nothing. Just the boy. Yes. Have a good flight. Tell the others I'm sorry. No, I'll phone him myself. You go. No problem, you go. No. No. - You want to try your mother again ? - No, she works today. I can show you Bucharest. I work with tourists. Can you help me ? I work here, in Gare de Nord. Phone number. For best view, Nicu is the man for you. Dalca Nicu ? - Are you together ? - Sorry ? She's my girlfriend. Put 'girlfriend' on your fucking form, asshole. Or I'll file a complaint with your boss. Your parents' address. Insurance policy number. - Can you manage ? - Do you think I'm an idiot ? Madam ? Madam ? Your boy has disappeared. He has no insurance. You'll have to pay. - English please. - Your boy has gone. Give me the paint. Fake. Does it look real now ? Here, little faggot. My change. - Go and screw your mother. - Fuck off. Just put me on as a crew member, that's fine. Not until tomorrow night ? Why ? What about the 1387 ? And deadheading ? No, I get that. OK, thanks. - You know him ? - No. Nicu ? No ? He is... with arm... No, I don't know him. Thank you. You come for me, yes ? Okay, so this station has a very rich history. - How are you ? How is your arm ? - Good. - Did you get any sleep ? - No. My mother says we bring you to the judge and take your fucking money. So, what's your next move ? For best city view, Nicu is the man for you. So you're my guide ? Yes, I'm very cheap. One hour, 40 lei. - With one arm... - For you 30. I give you 10. So where you wanna go ? Maybe Kretzulescu-church ? - 10, you choose. - Okay, 20. Special place for my girl. 10. More to left. - My left or your left ? - Mine. Yeah, you are too beautiful. - So where did you learn English ? - My father was businessman. Not anymore ? - He died. - Oh, I'm sorry. No sorry. He killed himself. A very good choice. You don't like ? What do you like ? I don't know. What do you like ? - No way. - Come. - Trust me. Come. - No. - You want to see what I like, yes ? - Yes, if I stay alive. Listen, listen... No train, okay ? No train, no problem. Trust me, come. I come here every day. - You sure ? - Yes. Good. Come... - Okay, let's go back. - No, no, just a short walk, okay ? Come, short walk. - That's not funny. - Very funny. You like ? Eyes closed. Blue. Color. It's blauw. Blauw ? For me it's "albastru". Hey, hello. Hey, sweetie. I missed you too. Yes. - Has he been sweet ? - Of course. - Coffee ? - Nice. Do you mind getting it yourself ? Bring the pot. - You were in Budapest. - Bucharest. - Did you have a good time ? - Well... Weren't you supposed to be back yesterday ? Yes. You're a sweetheart. Oh, the sweetener. Thank you. You're so quiet. - Do you have a lover ? - No. It's possible, isn't it ? Nothing wrong with the Eastern bloc. I once dated a Hungarian. You probably can't remember. You were about three or four. His name was Laszlo. Short guy, but yum yum yum. It was supposed to be a one-night stand, but his hands... A baby was born on board. Dear God. And there was no doctor, so I had to do it. My God, how awful. Why was she even allowed on the plane ? Well, she had more than five weeks to go. - It was quite intense. - Traumatic. It was also special. Oh God, you're upset. Why didn't you call me ? Come and sit down. It's probably all coming back. I'm going out to get your medication. Need anything else ? I'm allowed to ask, aren't I ? - Want me to do a load of laundry ? - Yes, please. - Was the baby healthy ? - Yes. - And the father ? - He wasn't there. Did you see his leash ? Basket. Good boy. I MISS U. NICU Evacuate. Come. Evacuate. Jump, and slide... Good job. Jump and slide. Very good. ...and slide. Ilyas, a plane may crash, you know. It's possible. And you might be lucky enough to die instantly. But what if you have to help screaming kids into their life vests so they won't drown ? Will you make jokes then too ? This is how to fasten the seatbelt and tighten it. And this is how to open it. Next: the life vest. And jump. Come on. Very good. Jump. There you go. Good. Come on. Jump. Good job. Nice and clean. Are you nice and clean, huh ? Flori ! Come. This one's for now. Where were you ? This one's for tomorrow. Brush your teeth. What happened to your arm ? Are you brushing twice a day ? And the upper ones. And now the lower ones. Ready now. Enough. Give me that. Go, off you go. Don't cry, little one. Flori, wipe away those fucking tears. Wipe them or they'll beat you. Go now. Go ! Hi, I have a Bucharest flight. - We turn right there. - Do you know this place ? Any fun stuff around here ? I couldn't find anything. If you like abandoned buildings and cheap booze. Or if you want to learn pole dancing. It's your first time here ? My mother likes cooking the vegetables. Can I meet her ? You eat this ? Hey. Hey, Nicu. Loser. Nice pussy there. Is she your mother ? Send her to me, if she wants a real hard dick. - Your friends ? - From school. Come. This is "hora". Love dance, it's for wedding. - Okay. - So you're my girl. I'm your boy and we are in love. Okay. I'm tired. Just a joke, okay ? Sorry. - We go to your room ? - No. I'll get some change. You wait here, okay ? - What are you doing here ? - I'm with her. - Sure you are. Piss off. - I'm with her. Lin ? Get lost, pervert, or I'll kick your ass. Rinse the sperm from your snout, cock sucker. No, no, it's okay. He's with me. So, four hours, that's 40 lei. - I only have fifty. Here, take it. - No, no. Special prize: ten. Normal prize: twenty. So four times twenty is eighty. It's a plague, isn't ? Weren't they going to clean up the place. Jerking off again, little slave ? Is she horny, that whore in blue of yours ? Yeah, man. She is crazy about little boys. She prefers it on her knees and she wants me to lick her and take her roughly from behind. We have brought some booze. Hey, damn it, I just cleaned up there. - Why would you ? - You know why, you asshole. Ever heard of someone who got it twice ? I haven't got it. So why are you still here then ? Fuck that whore until she can't live without you and she'll take you with her. You don't know how lucky you are. If I were you, I'd do it. I swear. The lower teeth too. It's okay. OK, come on. Let me see your hand. - Where does this come from ? - What ? That paint. Nice, huh ? Now I'm a princess. - Did you inhale it ? - No. - Flori, are you lying ? - No. Let go of me, filthy dog ! If you touch that paint one more time, I'll beat you with the stick. OK ? - I swear. - Nicu ! Quiet. What is it ? Take me with you. Flori, I can't. Take me with you. Where's that photo ? Show it. Remember this ? Do you remember ? It's Constantza. Think about Constantza. Is mom still there ? Yes. - In Constantza ? - Yes, in Constantza. Flori ? I met a woman. A woman in blue. Is she kind ? She's rich. Hi ! I heard you're doing a night stop in Bucharest. - That's possible. Why ? - Want to trade for Faro ? Chew it properly. Small bites. - Something like this ? - Don't you know a size ? 41 ? - How old is he or she ? - He. 15. It's for my nephew. He comes up to here. - Bleeding ? - Yes. - You okay ? - Yeah, I'm okay. - Hello ? - Hello, it's Lin. From the airplane. - How kind of you to come. - I wanted to see her. - That's adorable. - I brought it from Manhattan. - I hope it's the right size. - I'm sure it is. She'll grow into it. - Want to hold her ? - Yes. Have a seat. - Do you have kids ? - Yeah. I thought so. A boy or a girl ? A boy. That must be nice too. - How old is he ? - Fifteen. - 11th grade ? - 12th. - Early student. - I see. - Are you okay ? - No. Why ? - You want smile ? - Yeah. Because you pay. - That's not fair. - Fuck you. What's wrong ? What's her name ? Alex. She's beautiful. Stop. Step back. Nicu ! Step back, please. The girl jumped. Maybe she dreamt. That's okay. - For the soul of Alex. - "Bogdaproste." I know what you think. Really ? Yes. Why poor dog like Nicu give gloves ? He looks like shit. So, why ? I give it "bogdaproste". It means: I give for the dead. For Alex. If that woman wears gloves, Alex wears gloves. Come in. I'm gonna take a shower. You can go after me. You want to take a shower ? Here. Put them on. You like it ? - What ? - You are crazy. Why ? What's so funny ? - You are a crazy bitch. - Stop that. Nicu ! Stop ! You're hurting me. I can kill you now. We have to go. - We cannot stay ? - No. Why ? Because we can't. - Hey, your seatbelt. - Thank you. Geez, it's tight. OK, stick out your foot. Sorry. Got it. Did you worry a lot when I was little ? No, you were always so independent. You put yourself to bed when you weren't even five. "Do it myself", you always said. When you fell, no one was allowed to comfort you. Not even me. You'd go and cry in the hallway closet. And when I went to school for the first time ? How did you feel ? Relieved. Some mothers were very emotional, but I was relieved. As if I regained a part of myself. Just relaxing for an hour. No one who needs you. I really missed that. You didn't miss me ? You have no idea how tough that responsibility is. - Why don't you use that thing ? - It's going well, isn't it ? - Did you meet someone ? - I think I said no. - Yes. - Yes ? - Yes. - Wonderful ! - How's the sex ? - Mom... That woman always has it on in no time. Here, on. It's on. Is she coming back again ? Tomorrow. What does she smell like ? - Nice. - Nice, but how ? Like flowers, a bit of pine. And a bit like the wind when it freezes. When are you taking her money ? Can't she take us with her ? Take it. Here. Cool. - Mom sent it for your birthday. - Really ? Absolutely. - Are you lying ? - I swear I'm not. - Come on, man. - You can do it. - Come on. - Do it. - Your turn, momma's boy. - Fuck off ! Fuck off ! Faggot ! What are you doing ? Get off. Get off ! Get off. - What happened ? - It's nothing. I still have them. Okay, where you want to go ? Ateneul Român, Curtea Veche, Cismigiu Park ? Your place. I want to see where you live. Nicu ! My bed. No, no, no. Hot, very hot. You want a drink ? No, thank you. Who is he ? A friend. We go now ? Close your eyes. Show me your house. I'm not sure if I have any good pictures. Yes. Doggy. Bondi. How many rooms you have ? Oh, it's quite small. Three. One for Lin. One for doggy. And one for me. Nice. Nicu... I can't do that. I can't. No, Nicu. No... Hi, I'm Lin. What's your name ? I think you'd like a snack. That's not nice. Come here, I'll fasten your seatbelt. Let go. Let go of me. Listen, calm down and put on your seatbelt. I want you to take me off the schedule. It was just one incident. No. You don't send someone like that in the air. Lin, come on. You missed one flight in 19 years. You're one of our stars. Why would I suspend you for heaven's sake ? Four weeks, for a start. - Hey, you faggot. - You rat. - Do that again. - Come on, do it. Come, go and do it. Good job, momma's boy. Go on. - Come on, Nicu, do it. - Do it, do it. Nicu, turn around. I tried to call you. Did you forget about him ? Shall I keep him longer ? Yes, please. Thank you. Hey, baby, come here. Oh, baby. Hello ? - Thomas ? - Lin ? Am I disturbing you ? I noticed you were online, so I thought I'd give it a try. I can hear you, but I can't see you. Click on the screen at the bottom right. How are you ? Nice weather over there ? It's seven hours later, right ? Yes, fine. Lin, I'm actually still working. I don't use this program a lot. I thought you were a client. That's why I answered. - Would you mind if we... - No. Are you okay ? Not exactly okay. I... What... What do you still remember ? I remember very little. Just... Just the contractions, I think. Oh, dear. I don't remember a lot either. Everything was so strange. Awful. Right. I started screaming too, didn't I ? Why did I do that ? Well, they wanted to show it to you. I think they wanted you to touch it to be able to cope with it. And then you started screaming. Did you see anything ? A little willie or something ? Sorry. Sorry, Tom. About ? That I didn't let you... That on my own... That I didn't... - You have to move on, right ? - Yeah. I understand. - Thank you. - OK. I give you "bogdaprosta". - "Bogdaproste" ? - Yes, "bogdaproste". Thank you very much, Miss. Hi ! Thanks. Look. - You don't like it ? - Yes. You're okay ? Here. IN BLUE
