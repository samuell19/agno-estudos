"The sky calls out to the earth." "Come to your beloved." "You will have to come!" "You will have to leave this world." "You will have to break all these illusionary ties." "You will have to go!" Here are your belongings. Hope they are okay. Mohan, you are going back to the outside world... ...which considers you a murderer, criminal & antisocial. Don't try to come back to jail. Else, you won't be in a position to go out again. Go, you are free now. "This journey..." "...of life." "This journey of life." "This journey of life..." "...will always continue." "But alas!

But we never reached the... ...destination together. Where have those days gone? - Greetings, teacher. - Greetings. - You smoke! - No, sir. - No? Then where is it coming from? - I just ate hot 'Khichidi'. You ate at home and vapour coming out in the school! Get lost. What's all this! You people are always doing something. Stupid! - Is everyone present? - Yes, master. Yesterday's lesson... You tell me where do we get plenty of water from? From my grandma's eyes. Nonsense, it comes from the skies. Mohan, you tell me... ...what is the best thing to do in the world? Love. It shows you will definitely prosper in life. - What are you hiding behind? - Nothing. Nothing? Let me see. I know why you always have soar throat. Best thing in the world is love and... ...the worst thing is guava. Who is the nicest person in the world? You tell us. My father. Sit down. You won't study. I wonder why parents produce children like you. Manju, who is the nicest person in the world? It's Mohan. Of course, who can be more lovable than... ...flute playing Krishna! But he is God not human. Father, you said God takes birth as human too. He used to. These days even he is afraid of humans. What's this, teacher? Walk straight. You can never do that. You rascal you haven't spared master too. Get lost. Where are you rushing to? Come here. Father, Manju and me are going to play. There is no end to your playing. You starve yourself unnecessarily. - Sit here and eat this. - We will share it. Wear shoes. Else you may get hurt and cry. God only knows when my son will be an educated young man! When will I prosper and set up a store. Mohan is an idiot. He eats food raw. He is a kitten. Mohan is an idiot. He eats raw food. He's a kitten. Don't bring more mud. The house is ready. - House is ready, but... - But, what? I'm afraid of a storm. A storm cannot ruin them. I've built it on a height. Those fall apart first. This is after all a mud house. It is as good as steel. No storm or cyclone can destroy it. Okay, let us set it up. - It's me the lady of the house. - It's me, man of the house. House and we are ready but... - But what? - We are alone in our respective houses. What if someone kidnaps you? I'm afraid too. Let's close the doors. Where is my house? - Why did you destroy my house? - Why did you hide it from me? - I'll break your head. - I'll break you jaw. Never mind, Mohan. We will build another one. He is always in a hurry. Mohan is an idiot. He eats raw food. He is a kitten. The house and memories behind it are alive. And the innocent childhood. That was the life we are used to play with these. We used to play with toys then and... ...now... ...with some other toy. My day doesn't begin until I see you. Strange! I feel the same way about you. You are the sun and I'm the dawn. Hope we will never be separated. - Not when we are still alive. - Then tell about tomorrow. I'll tell you tomorrow. I don't like postponing. You have to tell me now. Listen. I forget about the world when I meet you. You are very good looking, handsome. You are so romantic. I wish... to marry you. Really! Then the prince replied holding the sword... I won't marry you like this. I'll win your hand. I'll fight Rana Pratap. Get killed... ...for your love. Stop this drama. Angry! I knew it. You have no brains. You can never get what I mean. I was saying this for you. - Really? Look at you! - I'll hit you. - Let me see. "The sky beckons to the earth." "Come, Oh my love." "You will have to come!" "Leaving this world..." "...breaking all the relationships..." "You will have to go!" I'll disappear with wind. - I'll come as a bird. - Still you cannot reach me. I'll catch you. "It's string time."

Then where were you? Father sent me to town in the morning. I'm returning now. You are expert in giving excuses. I'm a fool to come to meet you. A fair is going on. We have a stall in the center. Come, I'll serve you hot 'jilebis'. You eat half today and keep the rest for tomorrow. - I'm not coming to the fair. - You have to come. I won't come. I will come. Come to the fair. I'll keep hot jilebis for you. Want to feed me jilebis! I won't go. I won't go. I'll go. Basanti! Come in. You are not dressed up yet. Everyone has come. - Who all have come? - Gopi, Sheela and Champa. - My mother might hear. - I'll arrange, don't worry. Where are you going, Manju? You are always naughty. I too was young once but never behaved like you. Aunty.. - Shut up! She and me... Mother. Don't butter me up. No doubt I'm your stepmother. Yet your mother. Tell me where are you going dressed up? Why are you being harsh? She is stepdaughter but a daughter after all. You never treat her like a mother. You have spoiled her by your pampering. Look at her make up. You do it yourself even now. You have no control over yourself even at this age. Want to control her at her age! Foolish woman! Father may I go to fair. My friends are going. Okay. Give her some money. Oh you have a treasure at home! - Take this 4 paise and eat what you want. - Give me. Let's go. Lend me your hand. May I go to see the cattle brought in the village. - I'm sure it's a cow. - May I go. - Okay, go. She will get angry if I stop you. Put on slippers. Else you may get hurt. "This journey of life.."

I came out with great difficulty Let me show you around. Don't bother. We will manage. You look after yourself. Don't be alone. You might get lost in the fair. Many meet and many get lost in the fair. - Let's eat 'jilebis'. - I've no money. I spent what father gave. I've 50 paise with me. I'll spend it on you. I'm so happy to see you here. Oh God! - Let's go. Mohan has 50 paise. - Don't bother her. She might get giddy in a giant wheel. - Don't worry. I won't faint. - You will now. - Listen to Baba's discourses. - No. I will go with you. - Okay. God bless you. - What are you mumbling? I'm blessing you. Come on. Here comes my father. Save me. Mohan. Have you seen my daughter Basanti? - She.. - Oh she is hiding here! Let's go home. "You are my love, don't forget these days." "Youth never comes again." "My heart sings at your tune."

I'll go. - When will you meet again? - Tomorrow at the same place. - Mohan! - Uncle! - Haven't you seen Manju in the fair? - No. - Who got down from the cart now? Who? Must be a fox got on to the cart on the way. Bye, uncle. I have 50 paise. I'll spend it on you. Do you know... ...how happy I feel when I meet you? Basanti, Mohan has 50 paise. So, she went out with Mohan last night. Do you know where your daughter went last night? To the fair. She took my permission. You just smoke the pipe all your life. No. She went out with Mohan. One can live amongst jackals but not with a stepmother. If not for her, care for your reputation. Remember you are her mother. You never find a fault in her. Mohan has mesmerized her. - She even dreams of him. - What? - You are too much. - Come and see for yourself. Let's go. You want to kill me? To get rid of me? She wants to kill me? Don't talk bad about my mother. I worship her as long as I live. A cat. A cat. What happened, dear? It was a dream, father. To hell with you. May you rot in hell. - Kalva! - Brother, wait. - Court Marshal. - It's not in my court. - It's her. - What are you saying? You spoiled my suit. I will court marshal you. Come along. Leave me. - What? Mohan. - Who Mohan? - Court Marshal. - Save me. Left, right, left, right. - Let us take her. - Who are you? I'm a soldier. - Let her go. - No. She spoiled my suit. Let her go. Kalva, help, help! Uncle... save me... Thank God. Uncle... it's me. Mahku! Didn't you recognize him? It's Mahku. He studied with you in the school. Thank God, you saved a fight between us. Fight. A war. Who is that lady? She is Basanti, daughter of Bajarang the wrestler. Oh, good! Her garment looks like a parachute. You came after a long time. Drink water and go home. No need. She poured the whole pot on my head. - Uncle has a sweetmeat shop too. - I see. Let's go. Where were you all these years? I left the school and ran away. Did various jobs but joined the army subsequently. It is better to die than die here starving. Well done. Are you thrown out of it? I'm not thrown out. People are sacked after the war ended. I wanted to come here for a picnic. Picnic. I'll leave now. Bye, uncle. See you. - What does 'Chirio' mean? - Must be name of some herb. - Kalva. - Yes? - She seems to be strong. She struck me hard. - I'm going to meet Choudhary. - Okay, father. Don't go away after that girl when I leave. No. I'll be here till you come back. Where are you going out? Where are you going? Apply oil on my head. Manju! Manju! You poured kerosene on my head! Put it on fire too. Let it dry. I'll apply scented oil. Where are you going? Make some buttermilk for your father. "The sky beckons to the earth." "Come, O my beloved." "You will have to come." "Leaving this world..." "...breaking all the relationships..." "...we have to go." - Where were you for so long? - What do I say? Mother is very unkind. She is an obstacle when it's time to meet. No one can stop the river from meeting the ocean. Where are you saying this dialogue from? - From a book. - What is it's name? Heart. That's a dangerous book! One can fall sick by reading it. For those who have support of beloved won't be affected. Who is that beloved? - I won't tell. - You talk of disease but won't tell me? - Which disease? - I won't tell. Please tell me. Look at the bird flying in the distance. - Know where it's going? - Who knows? I have wings like that bird. Feel like flying, to a distant place... ...where no one can reach me. But our foundation lies on the ground. Respecting family values, parents' honour, village etc. Those leave all this behind cannot reach the sky. You are at it again? You better visit a doctor. No doctor can cure me. Only you can do it. I see! Come to my house. My concoction will cure you quickly. - Hold my hand once... - It's getting dark. - I'll leave now. - When will you meet me again? Tomorrow is Dasera festival. I'll come. You come too. Well done! Wait. You are too strong. You made my joints go loose. Stupid! I'm a villager remember? You are from army isn't it? I think after I left, Mohan became a hero in this village. Having affair with Basanti. No. It's with Manju. Basanti is a close friend of Manju. You cannot flirt with girls in this village. Shut up and bring water. Let's have both and go out. - I won't. - Why? You get things done for free like police. Make me do so many things but won't even show me photographs. I brought many things for you. They are coming by goods train. - Really! - Yes. Arrange for bath. Get up. - What are you doing? - Applying soap. Jaggu's mother said your clothes stink like a rotten goat. Shut up! Pour water, fast. Hurry up! - Ok. Here. You had bath and dressed up too. Now, show me those photographs. Yes. Tell me, will my angel come to the fair? Hope the pains I took in bathing etc. Won't go waste. - Which angel? - Basanti. That one. I'll bring her if she doesn't turn up. Atleast now show me those photographs. - I'll show you. Be ready. - I'm. I'm taking it out. Sit down comfortably. - This is the angel. - Where are the wings? They fly higher than real angels even without wings. But do we stand a chance? As it is I'm quite presentable today. One has to woo them in English. English? What's it in English? You don't know. I know. Say 'I love you', they are yours. - What to say if you love deeply? - Say 'I love you so much'. What? - So much means I love you very much. I'm bewitched by you. - What a hit. - Be happy that you are alive. She is dangerous. In Europe men say one thing at times like this. - What is that? - 'Sorry'. - Saree. When do they say 'dhoti'. - In a more difficult situation. Fair will get over. Let's go. Stand up straight, you fool. Boss, dance got over. Whenever I see my beloved... ...my heart beats like shunting of railway engine. - Look at the girls. - Where? You'll have to muster courage today and do something. - I'm waiting here to catch her when she passes this way. - Okay. Let go off my hand. You cannot tease me on the road. Mohan! Mohan! - What are you doing? - Kalva, save me. - Say sorry. Say something, atleast you'll be spared. Enough. Let me breath. What happened? Girls are honour of the village. I'll not spare you if you tease them again. You may go. Sister! Sister! Sister! - Mahku! - I'm leaving the village. I came to seek your blessings. They might be useful. What's the matter? Why are you leaving the village? A daughter is a daughter for entire village. I just can't bear this any longer. Why don't you speak straight. If I speak straight, I'll get trashed. All I say is control your daughter. Mohan is a rogue. I saw him playing polo with Basanti. Romancing with blacksmith's daughter. And with your daughter... Oh I cannot tell you. - Why not? - You are in danger. I don't understand your language but I know what you mean. I'll take care of Manju. Do something about me too. I'm hurt. Basanti is too cruel. Doesn't even look at me. Okay. But what is the need to leave the village? I'll take care no one says anything about you. Very good. O my sister, you should have been colonel in the army. Don't let Manju go to him. I have to leave. - Sit down. - No. I've to go. Sit down. - I've to go. Bye. - Okay, go. A small pebble can disturb a calm lake. I hope Mahku won't create trouble in our lives. They are part of the life. Life without sorrow is no less than death. Why don't you think of future? I just hope that things don't go against us. Don't worry. They might be helpful too. We have crossed childhood entered youth. No one can understand the hidden love in the heart. Just the two of us can understand this. One more person knows about it. That's God. - One more person too. Me. - Mahku. Yes, my name Manku. Go away from here. I'll go. But listen. Yesterday you told me village girls are it's honour. And you are going to ruin it? It's not your mistake but your youth's. Let me also be a partner if you don't mind. You hit me. It's physical. I'll assault you emotionally. Let's go. - Father... - Come here? - Yes. Coming. - Eat food. Where did you go? - Out. Attended Satyanarayana puja. I see. And here I was busy preparing the food... You eat your food, I'll get the prasad. Don't go. You cannot take the mountain route. If you get hurt, you'll have to keep your shop closed for 2 days. You are right. I cannot do household chores anymore. I want to get you married. She's a nice girl. She's pretty too. What if she is a washerman's daughter? What's your opinion about teacher's daughter Manju? - But heard that she is naughty. - No. She's a docile girl. O yes. She goes to the fair with you. Come on, father. No need to blush. I'll talk today itself. Teacher will surely approve this alliance. I don't approve this alliance. She's your daughter. You can give her anywhere. But I'll be blamed. We won't get a better boy. They grew up together. Mustn't break up their love. I've promised to his father. I never broke my promise till date. I don't like that boy. It is Manju's marriage not ours. You are just blabbering. They will be married. With Mohan. It's my final decision. Idiot! "Only the lantern is burning." Will you do some work or only singing? Look after work. You've to go to town. I went yesterday. Please you go. I've a stomach ache. I can go but... I don't know her choice in jewels. Jewels! What's the matter? - What's it, father? - Today is Monday. Six more days are left for the wedding. We have to buy gold. Teacher will be pleased about the alliance. - Shall I get the cart ready? - No. You have a stomachache. - I'll go. - Father. You have to close the shop if you over tire yourself. I'll go. I know you care about me. Leave in the evening. - Will you press my legs? - I'll. "The sky beckons the earth." "Come to me, my beloved." "You'll have to come." "Bid adieu to this world." "Liberate yourself from all the false bonds." "We'll have to leave this place." - Why are you angry? - It's my wish. It cannot be without my permission. - Got it? Better forget it else... - What will happen? I'll have to handcuff you today it self. - Handcuffs!? - I won't tell you. - But what's the reason? - Now it's my wish. Don't tell me. I came to tell you something. You will be overjoyed to hear it. - What is it? - First tell me who will handcuff me. - Me. - You. - Yes. Today is Monday. Only six more days are left. Then I'll handcuff you I came to tell you the same. I'm going to city to buy gold. Cart is ready. - What will you bring? - Whatever you say. Bring me gold which I can wear forever. - That is love. - I already have it. Doors to our lives opened for us. Let's open the doors of our toy houses too. I'll take care of the girl you take care of the boy from today. Consider we are holding each others lives in their form. I feel as if you are going abroad. Why? - Our village is our country everything else is abroad. I have to go. Else I'll be delayed in return journey. "O beloved, tell me when will you return?" "O beloved, tell me when will you return?" "O beloved, tell me when will you return?" "O beloved, tell me when will you return?" "The dark clouds will bring along..." "...the message of monsoon." "Then your memories will torment me." "When you don't find me beside you." "Tears will well up in your eyes." "Tell me my love, when will you come." "Whenever the cuckoo sings melodiously." "My heart flutters with joy." "Your beloved will cry in your absence." "If you ever hurt me..." "...you'll surely regret it." "O beloved, tell me when will you return?" "As the cool breeze blows..." "...all the blossoms dance with joy." "The young will be ebullient." "My eyes will search for you." "And your memories will torment me." "O beloved, tell me when will you return?" You keep on moaning. You don't tell me anything. How are you feeling now? Why not eat some dry ginger? It won't help. I'm sweating, In great pain. - What happened to you? - I'm in love with Basanti. - Only she can cure me. - No use of chanting her name. You have to spend money. Spend money. Go with sweets. Your job will be done. - I can but her father... - The wrestler? Yes. The way he glares at me... ...I feel I'm facing German tankers. He is not at home today. - She is alone at home today - No. - I swear. - Is she really alone? - Absolutely. God is great. Shall we go? Okay. - Let's go. Home sweet home. Wake her up. - Who is it? - It's her father. - Find out what's the matter. - Come inside. - Let's go. Where did you get me trapped? Idiot, come along. - Wrestler is calling. - Who are you? - We are your children. - How did you barge in? - Get up. We wish to become your students. We've brought sweets for you too. - Look at his body. - I know. Careful. No one can compete with him. We are nowhere compared to you. - Get ready. - I'll begin from tomorrow. I've stomachache. Wear loin cloth and start exercise. You will be cured. Pick it up! - Oh God. - 202.. - Oh brother.. - Kalva. - I'm dead. - 203.. - What happened? - 204.. Enough of it. 205.. Your stars today are bad. - What has he done to us? - God, reach us home. This is your house now you have to live here. Which jewellery will village girls like? Bangles, waistband, ear rings, and Tika. Then pack them. They have to meet her approval. You can bring it back if she doesn't like them. Don't go there. You will fall. A storm is going to hit. Remove the blind. Let's go home, fast. - Found his name and address? - No. - Uncle. - Yes, dear. Any news about Mohan? Don't know where he is gone. Where can he go? I told you he is a rogue. He kept a woman in the town. She must have taken him away. - A woman. - Don't underestimate today's women. They know to seduce men. Thank god. Wedding didn't take place yet. Mohan said he will poison the old lady first. Sorry. What are you saying? He will poison me! Daughter's life is our first priority now. I can handle it. I know a contractor from war times. He is a rich man. But wedding is fixed with Mohan. What will the villagers and the village rules say? You call them for a meeting. I'll clear all problems. - Wife... - Bye, sister. Look at the stain. Think of the stain you are going to get on your reputation. You said Mohan is the best boy. That sinner ran away with some other girl. - What? - What is there to say? Don't cry. What is happening? Why? It's all Mahku's mischief. He ruined your life. I cannot even wait for him. Convey my regards to him if he comes. Stop crying else it will create suspicion. I'm paying for the past with my tears. This is the only way to pay for that happiness. - Stop crying. - Let me cry, Basanti. Girls grow up in this country to cry. I didn't know your son will ruin me. My Mohan isn't a bad boy. Give me little more time. How can I get you time? Village court will decide for us now. You will go to court with a family matter! Aren't you ashamed? I've to save my name and my daughter's life. I'm a father of a daughter. Won't you care for our friendship since childhood? I'm helpless, Choudhary. My duty as a father compels me to... ...call for the village panchayat. (court). - I have to call for a meeting. - Oh no, teacher. Listen to the decision about our teacher's case. Our Mahku will announce it. Explain the matter and clear the misunderstandings. Get up. It's the matter of village's honour. Be careful! Hope you are not hurt. Ladies and gentleman. A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H.. No one cared when I've been saying this earlier. E, M, T, R, Y... Choudhary's son Mohan is... L, P, R, Q, W, X, Y, Z, L, M, N, P, Q... He ruined Manju's life. And F, R, Y, N, T, W. Out! He ran away with an other woman. Now he... H, O, N, O, R, I, F, A, C... - Explain what it means. - He will never come back here. U, T, C, T, D, B and C, I, G, I, P, B, M, T, B, M, W. Now, how do we deal with this rogue. That's what I mean. But.. He explains so well in English! - Like a mother feeds a child. - Wow. - Silence. Shut your mouth. - It means, silence. Don't you hear, brother is telling you in English to stay quiet? Waiting for Mohan is... ...ruining Manju's life. Means L, A, X, Y, M, I, M, A, H, R, O, D.. We have to find another groom, fast. Else, we will repent it for life. Okay. Let's find a groom for the girl. Thank you. Thank you. What can be done in such a short time left. Wedding time has approached. Wedding will take place at the same time with a different groom. Mahku is a learned man. What he says is right. You do something. I'm totally confused. To go and come 8 coins and for the groom 21 coins. How much is it? It's 29. - 29 is not a good number. Round it off to 30. It's done. What decision have you taken? It will ruin my son's life. It will ruin his life. If you don't care for Mohan. Atleast care for his father's tears. I beg of you don't ruin my son's life. Don't ruin his life. Don't ruin his life.

Odd figure is bad. Give me 30 anas and consider the alliance is fixed. See that the girl is healthy. I've brought a hard working girl like a machine... Wait. I'll bring money. - Okay. Keep it back. Stealing is a bad. You will take everything or keep something for me too? You can't digest this. Stand up straight. Count them. Wait. Give me. Okay, I'll leave. He has aged but not improved. He steals wherever he goes. Take it back. Sister... sister. You are here. I found such a groom that you will be pleased. I've paid the money I took. Now, get me married to Basanti if you find time. - I'll set up your home too. - I'm giving you trouble. I'll go now, bye. O my, dear... You are so beautiful... ...why not you ask me once what am I waiting for. Father went out today. I'm alone at home. May I come home? Can we sit and talk? You killed this poor man. Home sweet home. Don't you have a mat to sit? I'm tired. Open the door. - Oh God, spare the king. Your father is it at home! Yes. He is ruthless. He will kill you if are found here. He will kill me? Ruthless! Won't leave me alive? What do I do now? - Where are you hiding? - What to do? Hide in the empty gunny bag of potatoes. - No! No! - Gunny bag? - Yes. Open the door. - Where is the bag? - Here. Hide in it. I'm hiding. - Fast. - I'm doing fast. Home sweet home. Coming, father. - Load the goods. - Come on, guys. Quickly, be careful. Fast. Pick it up. Quickly. Fast. Please! Please, leave me. Why did you come in, you rascal. - Help, help. I'll not come now. - Idiot. - Get lost! - I will not come from now on. - How is he? - He uttered 'father'. He will survive. Yes, doctor. "The melody of your flute..." "...brings back your memories." "The melody of your flute..." "...brings back your memories." "Somewhere someone sings..." "...the songs of love." "O beloved, I spend sleepless nights..." "...thinking about you." "When the world sleeps peacefully." "I keep pining for you." "The melody of your flute..." "...brings back your memories." "The night wants to impress the earth with the moon's brilliance." "I yearn for my beloved." "O my beloved!" "I just yearn for your love." "The melody of your flute..." "...brings back your memories." "All my dreams are shattered." "Things are no longer the same since the day he left me." "The dark clouds of separation." "There's just obscure darkness all around." "The melody of your flute..." "...brings back your memories." Can you see what is happening, Basanti? I cannot wait for him anymore. Don't cry. Things will only become worse. - Doctor, which day is it? - Saturday. O God! Doctor I've to leave. Where will you go? Your wounds haven't healed yet. No, doctor. You have to stay for few more days. I cannot stay even for a moment more. I have to go. Someone is waiting for me there. Today is my wedding day. Yes. Today is my wedding day. Look what happened, Basanti. No one can change the fate. Proceed before the auspicious time is over. "Sing songs of union." "I have to go to my beloved's home." "Sing songs of union." "I have to go to my beloved's home." "Why do my eyes shed tears." "Without you, your beloved's home is lifeless." "O wanderer, let's go home." "The stars there are desperate to see me." "I have to go..." "Sing songs of union." "I have to go to my beloved's home." "Life may just pass by." "That's what I fear." "I am alone against the big bad world." "We may be separated." "May our good destiny not change for the bad." "I have to go to my beloved's home." "Sing songs of union." "I have to go to my beloved's home." "My eyes lookout for my beloved's home." "They are desperate to see her." "Your beloved calls out to you." "The one I miss, listen." "Childhood sweethearts will meet, their hearts will fill with joy." "I have to go to my beloved's home." "Sing songs of union." "I have to go to my beloved's home." "The sky calls out to the earth." "Come to your beloved." "You will have to come!" Basanti, you! Where is Manju? Why do you need her now. Go back to where you were hiding... - ...to your angel. - Which angel? Which angel? Who kept you tied up with her. A true lover never looks at any other girl than his beloved. I met with an accident in town. I was lying unconscious for 5 days in the hospital. I got discharged today. I come running. You are late. Villagers have ruined your life. What happened, Basanti? Hope Manju is fine. What is the use of her welfare to you. She is married now. Left for husband home today. What happened? Our dreams from childhood to youth are shattered. Manju is gone. Her home is no more here. Then why is it remaining? Let me destroy it too. What do you gain by breaking it? Break the neck of those who ruined your dreams. Mahku did it. Tell me. - King for two cents. King will surely come out. Deal the cards till the Queen is shown. - Leave. - Brother. Brother Mohan. I'm happy to see you. Where were you? I missed you a lot. Yes. Everyone was sad since you left. It's lively today again. We tried our best to stop the wedding. Master got greedy and ruined your life. Control yourself. - Kalva. He is scared. I warned you about it. Now, it's time for you to die. Brother.. dagger. Such a long dagger. Stop, my dear. It's not good to use weapons. Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Spare me. Please forgive me. You begged for your life. No one in this village raises hand on a such a man. Brother Mohan, go away from here. Why did you come here? Go, go. Don't harbor hard feelings. Go. - Has he gone? - He has gone. He came to fight with a soldier! Mohan, you have come! Father... Father, what is all this? What is all this? I tried my best to stop. No one heeded. You are crying? What's the use? Let us laugh together... ...which can fill this house. Where can I find such a laugh, father? One has to be brave. Else no one endure the hardships of life. Please, smile once for your father's sake. Please. I'm smiling, for your sake, father. I'm happy now. Keep smiling, my son. - Keep smiling, my dear. - Father... Don't fear. I'm fine. Let me hear the song you used to sing about... ...beloved, life and death. Want to hear the song, father? "The sky calls out to the earth." "Come to your beloved." "You will have to come." "You will have to leave this world." "You will have to break all these illusionary ties." "You will have to leave." What am I seeing? A husband looking at his wife. Wife? No, no. I never said a young girl... ...should be my wife. No. This is injustice. But it is ages old. My sister has deceived me badly. That is immaterial now. Society has bound as together... ...to live together till death. Now, neither you nor your sister can break it. I'm innocent. I've married for the sake of my children, not for me. God has snatched away mother's affection from them. - Greetings, father. - Look. - Greetings, mother. Greetings, mother. Greetings, mother. These children of the future are... ...turning rogues without affection and guidance. Be their mother. Be their mother. Accept them as your children. This is my last wish. Be their mother. Come on. Mother, he got heart attack again. Open your eyes. I have to see the world through them now. By taking my head on your lap... ...you have taken these children into your protection. Don't desert them. They are the children of the nation. I hand them over to you. O God! I know too are too young. Yet, have motherly affection. Where do I get such affection? I'll do anything to obtain it. It cannot be bought. It's priceless. If it is not bought, or got even by begging... ...tell me where do I get it from? Only your parents can answer it. I can't answer, but can only request you on behalf of all women. On behalf of... ...the thing that you like the most in the world. Accept them. This is my only wish. You came as my wife, fulfill your duty of a wife. These children are yours. Accept them. Accept them. You have to become their mother. How nice you are, mother. This is how the children get spoiled. No value for my words. Children need affection. Can be molded with affection. Epitome of love. If they do such things now, what will they do in future? You're very lenient to them. All of them are spoiled. If this is spoiling... ...I wish all the children of the nation are spoiled. You have become henpecked. What you have done for me and my children... ...isn't done by even angels. Don't say so. You are my life according to society. Your father has taken... ...loan of 800 rupees for your wedding. Here is the receipt. No need of receipt. Give me 2 days time. You will get your money. I'm going to doctor. Sure. I get upset when you get heart attack. Father, we want to come. I'm going to doctor. Take them too. Chunu coughs the whole night. And he has stomach ache. Show them to doctor. Come. - Sir, take back these ornaments. - Why, didn't the bride like them? Ornaments are good. But, I'm not approved. Do you still play with dolls? Play got over. Dolls remained. I take your leave now. Bye. Please come in. I'll go now. You have saved a woman from becoming a widow. I won't leave you without a treat. Sit down. I'll go. I've to go far. You are God in human form. Have a glass of milk atleast for my sake. Sit down. I'll be back. Devi. - Devi. - You are back! - I was afraid for you. - God came as... ...a man and saved me today. Else, you would have been a widow by now. I had an attack again. He is God for me too. Where is he? Bring a glass of milk fast. God doesn't stay in one place. I'll come with milk. - Take. - Take it back. God has left. Mother! - Hey! - I will not give the doll. Why are you making noise? What's this in your hand? - Idol? Where did you get it? - We found it in the guest's bag. How does he look like? Nice man. Brought us home in his cart. - Was his hair untidy. - Yes. Untidy. It must be him. Go and play. Down stairs. Go. Go and play. Down stairs. "I'm waiting for my beloved." "My heart bleeds for him." "He is probably avoiding me and leaving." "He is probably avoiding me." "He is probably avoiding me." "He is probably avoiding me and leaving." "How was I to know..." "...my heart would have to endure even this." "That he will come, but leave without meeting me." "But leave without meeting me." "But leave without meeting me." "That he will come, but leave without meeting me." "He must be aware..." "He must be aware..." "...of my helplessness." "The one who I look at longingly." "I look at longingly." "I look at longingly." "The one who I look at longingly." "I have been distanced from him now." "I have nothing to do with him now." "Someone tell him not to come here." "Not to come here." "Not to come here." "Someone tell him not to come here." Mahku! Mahku! Get lost... Don't stop me when going out. - What is it? - You look handsome. - Father isn't at home. - Make fool of a village jerk. - I'm not going to be fooled. - Listen. Don't try to hide me in the gunny bag again. Listen. - Where did you go? - To sell the ornaments. What do I do with them? Where Manju is gone? You gave up on her memories too. I only sold ornaments not Manju. Her memories will be with me always. Always. I'll show you. - What happened? - I lost my doll. I lost my doll. Excuse me. I left behind my doll here. Be seated. What sort of doll? I'll find it. Sit down. No, I've no time to sit. That doll was the last token of my love. I'll lose everything if I lose it. My life is attached to that doll. Please tell me if it's here. You look very upset. Let me find out. The man who saved my life that day lost something precious. Is that here by any chance? Children kept his bag. Ask him if it's belongs to him. - Is this the one? - Yes. Thank you very much. You gave back my lost life. Please check. Is it okay? This broken doll! Toys are made to be broken. I'm grateful to madam for keeping it safe. Tell her that the mad man who plays with dolls... ...conveyed his greetings. Mohan! Mohan! Mohan! Mohan! "You, who broke my heart." "Accept my best wishes." "After having ruined my life." "Begin your life anew." "You have the promise of our love." "Erase all your memories of love." "Whenever you miss me." "Just shed a few tears." "I don't know..." "...how to shun my loyalty." "I don't know..." "...how to shun my loyalty." "...how to shun my loyalty." "I have loved only you." "You can test me any time." "You, who broke my heart." "Accept my best wishes." "Sorrow is another name of love." "Accept it without complain." "Sorrow is another name of love." "Accept it without complain." "Accept it without complain." "If you still don't find peace." "Shed a few tears and sing a little." "After having ruined my life..." "Begin your life anew." "Whenever you miss me." "Just shed a few tears." Have you married me for this? You have ruined my daughter. You intentionally got married to her... ...to a man who was about to die. God won't forgive you. How can I guarantee for his life? His time came and he died. Not only him but Manju's youth also has ended. Her world came to an end. And it tortured a father's heart. Are you satisfied now, aunty? Was I her enemy? You evil, you have swallowed my brother. What are you waiting for? Get out from here. I won't let you live here for a minute. I'll complain to father if you throw her out. He is lying down. Sit here. Stay away from here. She will finish all of you if she lives here. She's a jinx. Enough. There is a limit to endurance. This misfortunate won't live here. Bye. Come here! Got lost. Go. They are the children of the nation. By taking my head on your lap... ...you have taken these children into your protection. You have to become their mother. This is my last wish. This is my last wish. Sister-in-law, don't force me to leave. I've yet to do lot for these children. - A lot. - You come back again! Get out else I'll throw you out insulted. - No one can throw her out. - I'll throw her out. Beat aunt! Mohan! Mohan! Mohan! - Who? - Get up. I brought food. - Take it back. I won't eat. How long will you suffer? As much as is written in my fate. Her old husband didn't keep her happy and he dead. I'll bring her today itself. Don't bring her here. Her husband died not her name. Her reputation will be spoiled. I'll lose my face too. Don't you love her anymore? I still love her but cannot see her humiliated. Moon is far away in the sky yet, is in the lap of river too. O my beloved don't think you are away. You are alive, burning in my heart like a forest fire. Wood becomes coal when burnt and then turns into ashes. My heart is burning but I cannot turn into neither coal nor ash. Basanti, come in. You still remember Basanti! You never looked at the village since you have come. You cannot remain like lifeless forever. I left as a married woman. How can I show my face as a widow? Father comes to meet me here. And mother doesn't matter. Anyway, who is there for me in this village? Many. How can you forget Mohan? Basanti! I am not just a girl now. I am a woman, a mother and a widow now. Do you want to stain the reputation of the family? Go away. I cannot hear anyone's name. I have nothing to do with anyone now. If you have no attachment, listen... ...my engagement with Mohan is going to take place. I came to invite you. Come positively. There won't be any fun without you. Food is going to spill. - You burnt your fingers. - I'm not burnt because of that. - Then, with what? - Your words. Is it because I'm snatching away Mohan from you? Or is it because of my engagement with him? You ruined him and want no one should revive him. You have shattered the nicest person in the village? Want no one else bring him alive? You have set up your home but cannot see others do it. Basanti! What have I done! What have I done! What have I done! You haven't done it but your love did it, you fool. It flares up like a tiny ember when the ashes are turned. The body disappears but the soul remains. Who will congratulate me if you don't come? I'm going. "My destiny was made, but was ruined again." "The world ruined us." "My destiny was made, but was ruined again." "The world ruined us." "Despite being overwhelmed by sorrow." "This heart only thinks of you." "Despite being overwhelmed by sorrow." "This heart only thinks of you." "My destiny was made.." "What is the point in crying over my lost love now." "Love has broken many a heart." "O broken hearted lovers, tell me..." "...who has destiny ever let flourish." "O broken hearted lovers, tell me..." "...who has destiny ever let flourish." "My destiny was made..." "It is difficult to live a confined life" "O death, I am waiting for you." "Come and softly tell me..." "...I am releasing you." "Come and softly tell me..." "...I am releasing you." "My destiny was made, but was ruined again" "The world ruined us." "My destiny was made." My engagement with Mohan is taking place. I came to invite you. Come positively. There is no fun without you. Is it because I'm snatching away Mohan from you? Or, I'm getting engaged to him? You crushed down a nicest person. Don't want others revive him. You set up your home. Why cannot you see others do it? Mother, where are you going? Sleep dear. I'm not going anywhere. Going no where. Sleep, dear. Sleep! Sleep, dear. Sleep, dear. Sleep, dear. The rope broke! "The sky calls out to the earth." "Come to your beloved." "You will have to come." Brother Mahku... Brother Mahku.. Brother Mahku... Get up. - Get up. - What's the matter? Listen. Really? - I saw it myself. - Bring me my coat. Fast. God, I wish this gets joined again. "The sky calls out to the earth." "Come to your beloved." "You will have to come!" Manju! Here! I came to congratulate you for your engagement. Engagement is done for people who are alive. I died the day you left the village, married. You said we will never separate. But you separated yourself from me. Why did you do it, Manju? Why did you do it? My life was for you. You couldn't take care of it. My body belongs to someone. Soul belongs to you. Souls can unite... ...when the body ceases to be alive. Manju! Look, the storm is going to hit. I should go back. I've to go back. I've to go back. Are you going away? Yes. I've to go. I've to go. Our union isn't acceptable to the society. No. - Don't go, Manju. - No. Our path are different now. We have to go in two different directions. Manju! Life has ended. But not the love. You are dead for the world but alive for me. You will be alive for me forever. No one else can possess you now. You are mine from today. Mine only. You will be mine forever, Manju. You, Sinner. What did I do to deserve your revenge? Speak up. What can he say. Call police before he escapes. We will fight the case. - Beat him! - Order! Order! Order! Order! The accused doesn't want to say anything against the evidence. All the evidence shows he committed the murder. So, the court awards him 20 years imprisonment. "The sky calls out to the earth." "Come to your beloved." "You will have to come!" Manju! I'm coming. "You will have to leave this world." "You will have to break all these illusionary ties." "And leave." Manju wait. I'm coming. "This journey of life." "This journey of life..." "...will always continue." "But alas! We won't be there.." "...will always continue." "But alas! We won't be there." "This journey of life."
