I told you that you need to get off that phone. You're always on that phone, now get to class. Rico. Whoa, whoa, you straight? - Yeah, man I'm good. - You're good? Yeah, I'm good, what's up? What's up is your medical bills. Boy, you know you got broke up in practice. Man, here he go. I know you ain't talking mister, oh coach I can't see, the sun in my eyes. Man that happened one time, you know me. Aight, aight, about two or three times. Man, get off my back. Yeah, two or three times per practice and we on two-a days. Whatever man, what up Paul? Nothin' much much. Thinkin' about the game tonight huh? Not really, man. I'm not even really thinkin' about the game. You ain't thinkin' about the game? Man, if we gonna make it to the playoffs you gotta be worried about this game right here. I mean you're one of the best players we got. Man, you should be focused. Plus, I hear they're gonna have scouts at the game tonight. Man, you know Paul ain't worried about them scouts when he got a drawer full of scholarship offers. Boy you ain't gon' never be nothing! This boy has God given talent he was put on this earth to play ball. Yeah you was an accident! Man he ain't even listening. Yo Paul, you listening? Yeah man, I hear y'all. He probably over there thinking about Nina. Speaking of y'all heard about that party tonight? Oh yeah I'ma be there. I'ma see you man. Aight bro. What's up with ya boy man? Man I don't even know. Class can anybody conjugate that for me? Miss Nina. Yes? Can you conjugate Matthew? Yes ma'am. Are you paying attention? Where's your book? We're on page 548. You have to study and read if you want to do perfect for those finals. Are you even listening? One more remark like that and you'll be going straight to detention. All of my aggression is taken out on the field. Pain and hurt, oh I know how it feels. Tell me where's this peace, that they claim is real? Wish I was a clam, so I could live in my shell. I hate life, I hate it. What's the point of all of this? They say God is love but this heart was missed. Dismissed, off to hell I think burning is better. So God if you're real I hope you're moved by this letter. Aye Paul! Yo what up bruh you seem kinda off today. Nothing much man I just been having a lot on my mind. Like what? Too much. A lot that I don't even feel like is worth talking about right now. You sure? Positive. Well you know what's going to help you forget about all that right? What's that? That party they're throwing tonight after the game! Man I don't know. You know my people was tripping on the last party that I went to. Naw man see yo people was tripping more so on how late you came in and how messed up you were, rather than the fact you went to a party. How about this? Go home after the game, wait until your people's sleep, shoot me a text and I'll come scoop you up. Hey bro! Hey sis. What up D? What up? Man I don't know. Come on man it's our last home game and your senior year in high school. Hold on wait wait don't tell me you're afraid of your hypocriting Pastor. It's not him I'm worried about. I just don't want to disappoint my mama. Okay I feel you, really. I see where you're coming from, but you're forgetting the best part. Hey Paul. Hey Nina. Are you coming to my party tonight? I'm thinking about it. I'll be there. So what's there to think about? I don't know. Well it'll make my night better if you came. We'll see. Okay. For reasons I don't understand you're attracted to her, and y'all been locking eyes ever since like freshman year so you might as well make the relationship official tonight at the party. I'ma think about it. So I'll be waiting on your text. Let me get out of here man. Alright bro. So I'll see you tonight! I said I'll think about it. Hey ma! Boy you better say something before you walk in this house. About to give me a heart attack. Hey mom. Hey baby. So how was school today? School was school. That's it? What'd you learn? I learned how to fail a chemistry test. Fail Tatiyanna? Not failed failed but I just don't think I did that well. You know she don't like me. Always the teacher's fault. Mm hmm. Now you know I taught you better than that. I'm just playing mama. Alright. But you look pretty today. Thank you! And I like that make up on you. It's Friday gotta be ready for the game. You plan on wearing that all day? Nina just re-did it. But you know that make-up is a little bit too dark for your daddy. You're gonna have to take that off. She just re-did it! I'm sorry Tatiana it's okay for me but you know how your daddy is. Go take that make-up off. Man. So Paul. Yes mam. How excited are you right now? Over joyed. All right, all right. I know you've been thinking about college because I've been thinking about it too. Awe yes mam. It's been on my mind. So have you made any decisions? Not really I haven't came to a sure decision yet. I'm still undecided. Okay, well there's nothing wrong with that. But you know I've been praying. Oh yes, of course. That God will lead and guide you in the right path. Yes mam. And you know which one that is right? Yes ma'am I know I know. Well I'ma be there, I'm going to make sure I support you. I'm your number one fan you know that right? Oh of course! Alright. Hey are you and dad, y'all coming to the game tonight? I'ma have to call your daddy and see. Hello? Hey Adrian I'm not going to keep you long I know you're at work and pretty busy. But Paul has a game. Do you think you'll be able to make it tonight? Game? Woman I've been up since 3 o'clock this morning I'm not going to no game. You know that! I understand. He's not going to be able to make it. Yeah you're right I'm not going to be able to make it! I'm out here working a 14 hour shift. It seem like I'm the only one worried about putting the food in the house, that you keep burning! So no I ain't going to no game that's out the question. I know that Adrian. Okay so if you know it what you calling me for? I just thought we should spend some quality time as a family. Quality time. I think it would be a good idea if we just support Paul as a family. Support? Is that so much to ask? I'll tell you what I'm going to support Paul like you supported me my senior year. You remember when you popped up and got pregnant? Now you wanna go and bring that up? No you brought up. You the one started talking about support. Now I'm talking about my lack of support. You know what if it wouldn't have been for you I would've been in the pros. Adrian we never do anything together as a family. I just thought maybe we could have that time together. Here you go again talking about time Leah. I tell you what since you got so much time on your hands how about you go spend some time in front of the TV and watch one of them cooking channels so maybe they can show you something about cooking. Leah better yet just go down to one of those gyms and spend some time with them since you then let yourself go since we got married. You got so much time on your hands. You know what Adrian? I'm sorry I should've never brought it up. You being sorry is the smartest thing you said all day. Hello? Clean yourself up! Go fix your hair Leah look nice for a change! I'll tell you what I'm going to support Paul like you supported me my senior year. You remember when you popped up and got pregnant? It seem like I'm the only one worried about putting the food in the house, that you keep burning! No you brought up. You the one started talking about support. Now I'm talking about my lack of support. You know what if it wouldn't have been for you I would've been in the pros. You being sorry is the smartest thing you said all day! I'm trying! This is just too hard! I can't take this anymore. It would be Nina to rent out one of the biggest spots in the city! Yeah she went all out with this one! I know it's the perfect way to celebrate a win! See man what I told you. You had fun didn't you? Yeah man I had a real good time. Thanks for the ride though. No problem. You know son. When I was yo age I learned that you couldn't go back through a window that's been locked from the inside. And if you would've tried to go back through that window. You would've noticed that I locked it. Then, you wouldn't of came through my front door with that dumb smile on your face. Where you been? Boy I said where you been? I went to a party! So I guess you ain't learn from the last time you just went to a party. You think I'ma keep letting you go out and come in my house at three o'clock in the morning and I ain't gon' to tell you nothing? Look I'm just trying to enjoy my time here before I go off to college! What you said? Before you go off to college? We then already had this conversation Paul. You're not going off to college! You're going to school in this city to get your education! You're already going out partying you think I'm let you go out of state and waste my money partying? I wouldn't be wasting your money! I got full ride scholarships and you know that! And besides don't you think that should be my choice? I mean it is my future! But guess what? I'm still your father, that means I still got the final say so you understand? And for one, I'm not going to have you disrespect me in my house boy so watch your tone when you're talking to me. I'm not trying to hear this tonight. Boy you gon' hear everything I gotta tell you don't you ever walk off when I'm trying to talk to you. Go sit down. Boy I said go sit down! I'm trying to be patient with you Paul. I really am man. But you about to push me to that level and I don't want to take it there with you, you understand me? You gon' respect me in my house boy! Why are y'all always arguing? I can't never sleep. Tatiyanna, get back in your room little girl 'cause right now this don't even concern you. Didn't you just preach a message about love and peace in the home? You know we never see that. You want to see love and peace in this home? Yes. You gon' rest in peace if you don't get back in that room like I told you. That message anyway was for my congregation. So what you're saying is it's okay to live one way at church and another way at home? Woman, get back in that room! Adrian these are our kids. We're suppose to be an example to them. Be an example to your daughter by being submissive when I said get back in that room! Boy get your hands off me! You thinking you this big super star athlete! You getting all kind of praise from your little partners and stuff like you're all that but you're really not! You understand? I've been in that same little spot you're in! I've been in them shoes boy! 17 years old on my way to the pros! But I made one to the dumbest mistakes of my life and you remind me of that every time I look at you! You understand? It's not even about that! It's about the respect and honor that you preach about! Pastor Adrian! That's right boy I'm your Pastor! Mmm hmm hypocrite. Hypocrite? Yes, hypocrite. I'm tired of your mouth little girl! Boy this my last time telling you not to put your hands on me, you understand? Don't you ever put your hands on me again boy! Woman didn't I just tell you to get back in that room? - Shut up! - Mama? - Put that gun. - I said shut up! - Mama what are you doing? - Paul move! - Mama no please. - I said move! Leah put that... You don't know how hard it is to live with someone who's so controlling! I'm so sick of this! You don't know how hard I've cried every night! I can't keep nothing down! My weight is up and down! My hair is falling out! I just can't take this anymore! Leah okay. Do you Adrian Vincent take Leah Morris to be your beloved wife? To have and to hold from this day forward for better for worse for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health to love honor and cherish for as long as you both shall live? Yeah I do. Do you Leah Morris take Adrian Vincent to be your beloved husband? To have and to hold from this day forward for better for worse for richer or poorer, in sickness and in health to love honor and cherish for as long as you both shall live? I do. Don't do this to us mama please! 911 what's your emergency? Please oh my God please! Ma'am, calm down what's your emergency? Please! Ma'am please calm down what's your emergency? God my mama just shot herself I don't know what to do! Okay is she still with us? I don't know but there's blood everywhere! Ma'am please go check and see if she's still breathing. I can't, I can't! Ma'am. Please just hurry, please! Okay what's your address? 2014 Alamo Street please! I have an ambulance, I have a rescue and police officers in route. I need you to stay on the line with me and try to stay calm. Why mama, why? God how could I have been so blind God? Why didn't show me that? Why didn't you show me this was on her mind God? God no Lord no God, Leah! Leah please baby! Back up this is all your fault! I know I'm so, Lord I know I'm sorry I'm sorry. I'm sorry. God, how can I go on? She was all I had! She was my strength! She was my encouragement! She was the one that I talked to! I'm all alone now! I'm all alone. Well Mr. Vincent, due to the extensive damage on her head and face an open casket really isn't an option. However, you may proceed with a closed casket. I don't think I want to use a casket. I feel as though, people should remember Leah as she was. Maybe we can get some of her best photos and put them out on an easel with some flowers all around. You know, just, more of her personality. And about the program. I want to make sure I have everything correct. Leah, is that short for anything? Mr. Vincent, is that short for anything? You gotta show me that. You gotta show me that. Man. Excuse me, excuse me. Say red don't I know you? It's Leah. I'm saying I know, I know you. Adrian. Vincent, I know. We have algebra together. Right. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. But you ain't gotta to be that formal with me. They call me Vinny or you can call me the great one. - The great one? - The great. Do you hear this? I'm definitely not calling you that. Okay, it's funny? What ya mama call ya? I don't really see what my mama got to do with this but she call me lil boy. Lil boy? You know, get out my face lil boy. You getting on my nerves lil boy. That's funny? Yeah. So Leah what's that short for Ah-leah? No. Is that short for anything? No just Leah. L-E-A-H. Mr. Vincent. Is that short for anything? No, just Leah. L-E-A-H. Okay and since you're opting out of the casket. Are you considering cremation? I think cremation would be best. So the abuse never ends huh? Paul what are you talking about? You preach one way, you live another, you abuse your family. You killed my mama and now you plan on burning her! What else you plan on taking from me? Taking from you? Paul you think you the only one hurting right now? Boy I've lost just as much as you have! Shut up! Everybody just shut up! You didn't lose nothing. You threw everything away! Maybe you should come back at another time. Yes sir! Everything was laid out so nice. Did you see those flowers? Girl yeah they were gorgeous I don't know why they left them at the church I was going to ask him for that purple one. Girl you silly. Hey girl! I thought you had to work today. I did, but I cancelled, I had to be here. Well I'm glad you could make it. Mary this is Monique. Hi Mary. Hey nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. I'm Leah's sister in law. Okay. Do you go to church with them? Yes. Anyway, did y'all see how Pastor Adrian broke down during that eulogy? Yes, you could just see the pain in his eyes. Pain? Girl that was guilt. What you mean? Come on now y'all. Everything was not all holy and righteous like people thought. Here she goes. I'm serious, Leah use to call me all the time crying. Telling me stuff that was going on. Y'all just don't know. I know the Vincent's and they wouldn't act that way. You said the keyword right there boo. Act. That's all they ever do is put on a show. I'm telling you. I don't know. I know this. She sure wouldn't have killed herself if everything was going good. Something had to have been going wrong. Well I don't know, and I don't want to know. And I know too much. Exactly. Do you mind if I sit with you? What's on your mind? Just thinking about her. I've been thinking about her a lot too. You know she really loved you. I know it's a lot going on with you right now. It's a lot going on in your mind. But I want you to know that I'm here with you. And if it's anything you need I want you to let me know. Just save it. It's okay you can talk to me. I'ma be okay. Paul is who you really need to try to talk to. You're right. Have you seen him? He's in the back with Damian. Listen I'ma go talk to your brother. And if you need anything I want you to let me know, okay? I love you. Tatiyanna I love you. All right I'm gone. Man I just want to thank you for coming over. Awe It's no problem man. We're boys I wouldn't leave you hanging. Especially at a time like this. Yeah man I feel so empty now. My mom she was the one who took me to the side and had real talks with me. I would feel nothing but love coming from her. Even when she corrected me about things. My dad on the other hand. He always yelled at me. He spoke at me and not to me. That's why I've been able to do so well on the football field all these years. I learned how to channel my aggression. Man I can't believe this. But then again I can. Man he pushed her too far this time. It's crazy though, none of this seems real. When you're driving the speed limit and your sure of it. You see the police officer then you are not afraid but there's still some reverence. You still check him out you'll watch him in your rearview mirror, even if you were driving the speed limit. I'm telling you that because we are worried about a ticket that we can pay with money. But I'm talking about a soul, that can spend forever in eternal hell fire. And a soul that can have a life where they never die. The choice is yours to make. God said you choose whom you will serve. God spoke of the earth will be filled with violence. This is what's happening today. He talked about in the end of time. How that the mother would turn against the daughter and the daughter against her mother. The son would rise up against his father and the father against the son. Now today whenever there's a murder many times that's unsolved, the prime suspect is a relative. The Bible said the time would come that a man's foes would be, they of his own household. I never would've believed that I would see that. But I believed what God said and I believed we were in the end of time. And I prepared myself based on one occasion where I would hear of a family member fighting another. I said that's what God said. But now it's common place. What am I telling you this for? God as well as he's spoken these things would happen, he's also spoken of a time of judgment. That we will all stand before him in that day. The Bible has told us except a man be born of water and spirit that man cannot see, the kingdom of God. You will not luck up and get to heaven and the devil will tell you, well I just believe God's gonna, let me by some how. I just you know I just believe things gon' change. You know I believe well when that time comes. He wants you holding back, he wants you waiting, he wants you trusting in a fantasy. He don't want you getting up and doing something and recognizing I see the police out there I better get of my gas. I'm speeding! I better check my life, I may be speeding! Thank you and may God bless you! Man that's exactly what I needed! What's wrong with you? That man? Who? The man on the commercial. Yeah, what about him? That's my bishop. What? What you mean? I grew up at the church he was preaching at. What? When I was young my dad got saved and begin to dedicate himself to the ministry. After a few years my mom ended up leaving him because she felt like he didn't love her. But really it was because she wasn't as dedicated as he was. A few months after she moved out she ended up getting custody of me. After only going to service on the weekends I was with my dad and not connecting to the body and the ministry. I stopped wanting to go completely. Before I knew it I started hanging out with different groups at school. And eventually I started being influenced rather than being the influence. So you mean to tell me after all this time you had what I needed and didn't say nothing? I'm sorry man. How could I tell you what you should've and could've been doing when I wasn't doing it myself? You could've at least said something. Man all my life I lived wondering what the solution to my problem was. Wondering if there was people actually living the truth and not just quoting it. I always wondered if I could actually find truth peace, and the person who I thought was my best friend withheld all the answers from me and made it seem like I could find it in the females, drugs and partying. I'm sorry man. Man get out my house. I said I'm sorry. I said get out my house. There you go, there you go. Lock out, lock out! So the dynamic duo then split huh? Lightweight, Lightweight Yep. So what's gon' happen to the kids? Come on man. Lighten up. I'm just messing with you. Coach want you man. Close the door. Have a seat. I gotta talk to you about your grades. What about 'em? I just got your progress report man and it's not looking good. I'ma have to sit you down. Now I talked to one of your teachers. She's willing to work with you. She's willing to help you and tutor you on the weekend and after school if need be. Vincent you hear me talking to you? Yeah I hear you! Well you gon' get with this lady about getting your grades up? I don't know. What you mean you don't know? I'm trying to help you out. I'm trying to help you so you can continue to play despite the fact you ain't even been playing well. Yeah so I've been a little bit off my game lately. But at least I'm trying. I don't need you to try. I need you to do it. Do it like you did it in the past. On and off the field. Look man. I understand that you're going through some things. I understand you just lost your mom. No you don't understand! That's the problem everybody thinks they understand! Nobody gets what I'm going through! Well why don't you help me to help you? Look I don't need your help or anybody else's help! I tell you what, get out my office you're off the team until further notice! Man, whatever. But he told the believers, he told the ones that believed in him. Now, it's important for you, to continue in my word! Not just believe me and go on about away from my word. But if you continue in my word. Then you are my disciple indeed. And you shall know the truth. And the truth shall make you free. It is only through you continuing in God's word that you truly start, knowing the truth. This word know does not just mean you understand what was spoken. You can understand what I speak and still not know the truth. I can speak this Bible all day long and you can believe what it says but until you continue in the word and start to know the truth how do you know the truth? We must understand this word know used in this context. This word know in this context really meant to become intimate with. It is not the truth that you hear Bishop preach that frees you from your old methods and your old ways. Because you can walk around here and say oh yeah he preached the truth. But it's only when you will open up your mind, your way of life and allow the truth to take part of your life and you exercise it in your everyday doing. That's the truth that'll free you from lesbianism. That's the truth that'll free you from homosexuality. That's the truth that'll free you from whoremonging. That's the truth that'll free you from being drunken or filled with drugs! When you know the truth the truth is in your reasoning. When you reason to do something and you're tempted to do something. The truth is in the midst of your reasoning and you are not led away by how you feel about doing something. Oh so and so makes me feel good but you are lead to do what the truth of God's word says because you'll know the truth you have opened up and let it in you. And that truth starts to change a man from one condition to another. Hey, how you doing? Good I guess. Can I help you with anything? Yeah, I'm looking for Bishop Wendell Archie. I saw him on TV today and I want to ask him a few things. Okay unfortunately he's not here right now. I'm actually about to lock up and get out here myself after I do a little touch up cleaning here. That's alright I'll just come back another time. Okay well look if you need someone to talk to I'll be here for about another 30 minutes or so. No offense but I would rather get advice from somebody that actually comes to this church, not the janitor. Is that right? Well I don't think we formally met. What's your name? Paul. Paul my name is Eathan. I'm a minister here. A minister? Like ordained and everything? Yeah. The license, the horn of oil, the whole nine. I'm sorry I thought cause of the broom and all. No need to apologize I'm not offended. At all. You wouldn't catch any of the ministers at my father's church sweeping floors. Well Jesus is our example and the Bible says how he made himself of no reputation. But took upon himself the form of a servant and the thing about it the way up is down in this life. You know the Bible lets me know that they that humble themselves under the mighty hand of God he said he'll exalt them in due time. See that's one thing I noticed about the commercials this church doesn't water down or over look scriptures they take them for what they are. And when I finally watched one of his messages. I knew that everything that he was saying was true because he said it like he truly believed it. He didn't make it seem like God didn't mean what he said. Right and God definitely means what he says you know. We don't add to and we don't take away. The Bible says man should not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. And we actually believe in applying those scriptures to our lives every day. Well maybe you can help me then. Okay maybe I can. Let's take a seat over here. All my life, I've been abused by my father. Mainly verbally. But it's been going on for so long that, I've developed a hatred for him. I never really take it out on him. I usually take it out on the football field. Which has worked out pretty well for me in the past, but, man now he's saying I can't choose what school I want to go to. I mean it's so many different things. I ended up coming home late from a party and when I came home me and my dad got into it. One thing lead to another and before the argument was over with my mom she ended up, she ended up killing herself! I mean I'm I'm at the point I don't know what to do. I don't know what to think. At times I begin to think about committing suicide myself. But when I seen that commercial it really did something for me. It's like everything he was preaching it was what I've been searching for my whole life. I mean this is my last hope. Wow, ummm, Look uhh I know, I know it must be pretty tough for you and your family right now. But I also do know that God is able to bring us through the toughest of times. You know and in this book called life. There's a lot of different chapters and different pressures that come upon a man. But the thing about God he's given man a free will. That man does what he wants, in those times of pressure. So we can't blame God and we can't charge God foolishly for things that some one else does when the pressure comes upon them. And we can't hold unforgiveness in our heart towards other people. Because ultimately it boils down to you and God. You know I heard you mention about this being your last hope. You know the Bible says how God has called us in one hope of his calling and many times what God does is he uses these situations that we encounter in life to get us to realize that he is our only hope. So why does God have to draw people by allowing things to happen to him? Well let me ask you this. If everything was going right in your life right now. Would you be here talking to me? Probably not. You see many people. They think they're all right with God. So God has to allow things to happen to get people to really see where they put their trust and where they put their confidence at and many people resort to things that are not like God. Women resort to men to take care of them. Men resort to women for satisfaction. Resort to alcohol, resort to drugs, partying. A life that does not include God at all. He's given us so many different situations in that Bible. That teaches us how we should handle things that we encounter. The Bible says how Jesus he said it was need be that he go. He said if I don't go, he said the comforter will not come. He would give us another comforter so we wouldn't have to put our confidence and our trust and try to find comfort in things that do not pertain to God. Man well what do I have to do? I mean I'm tired of my life falling apart like this. You need the spirit of God in your life. What is that? The Holy Ghost which is the spirit of God. It is that comforter that I'm telling you about. And what happens when God gives a man his spirit he gives that man power to say no to the things that he always wanted to say no to but never could really commit to. It gives that man power over sin in his life. It gives that man a conviction about things that normally seemed okay. But what it is the mind of God it is his personality that he puts inside of man and he begins to feel a conviction about things that God says I don't like. Without the spirit of God a man can't really please God because he doesn't know how God really feels about things, so he'll continue to do things that he thinks God is okay with. That God really is not okay with. I mean but my dad told me if I accept the Lord Jesus Christ as my personal savior if I confessed with my mouth and I truly meant it in my heart then I was saved everything would be alright. Right. But the Bible goes on to tell us in Romans chapter 10. It says with the mouth confession is made, but with the heart man believes onto righteousness. As far as accepting the Lord the Bible tells us that we have to be accepted of him. We don't accept the Lord he approves us. But with the heart he said you'll believe onto righteousness you'll begin to do something different. When a man receives the spirit of God and begins to walk after God there's a change that takes place in his life. He can't remain the same. He can't remain around the same old friends. He can't remain around the same influences because they'll continue to be an influence. But when God gets a hold of him and he begins to do what's right to God, God becomes the influence in his life. Man they really don't teach this at my dad's church. And most churches don't but it doesn't do away with the fact that it's still true. The Bible says let God's word be true and every man a liar. So regardless if it's popular or if it's not popular, if the world agrees or disagrees. It's still true. Man I'm really glad I came. Look I'll tell you what. I want to give you my information here. My phone number. I want to stay in touch with you. So feel free to give me a call anytime. Okay man thank you I'll definitely be using this. I mean I'm starting to feel better already. Amen. That's how God does. He knows what you need. But before you leave here today I would like to pray with you if you don't mind. Okay. You know the Bible says when a man repents, which means to turn away from that lifestyle that he use to living the sinful life he's use to chasing after. What mom and dad may have taught what sister and brother or grandfather may have instilled in you that was contrary to God. When you repent God looks at you and says I want to fill that man with the spirit of God. So today when I pray with you I want you to repent and I want you to talk to God so that God will fill you with the Holy Ghost. - Amen? - Amen. Remember you just talk to God and you pray. Father in the name of Jesus. God I pray right now God first and foremost oh God. God that you would help this young man to forgive his father God . God for you said if we do not forgive that you will not forgive us our trespasses God. God teach him how to mend the relationship between him and his father God. God I pray God that you would help him to be strong oh God for his family at this time oh God. That they would see your power operating in him oh God. That they would begin to inquire at what this is that is keeping him strong in this hour oh God. God I pray father that you would give him wisdom God to counter the influences of the peer pressures oh God. The things that he deals with on the day to day basis at his school God. God help him to renounce and to denounce God the lifestyle that has kept him bound for so long God. To put aside the things oh God that are keeping him away from you Father. God the iniquity that is in his heart oh God. The things God the sin in his heart that is keeping him away from you God. God I pray father that you would help him oh God. Give him a heart and a mind God to change oh God. God help him to be free today God by filling him with your power oh God. Which this is the only way that a man can be free oh God. God By receiving your spirit oh God. God and I pray today that you would forgive him of his sins oh God. God wash him clean God. God wash him white as snow as your word has declared oh God. God that he may walk away today a new man God that people might see him with a different identity God. They might see him manifesting a different character that comes only from heaven oh God. God that they might see Christ and your word walking in him and talking through him oh God. But you have said in your word oh God that if we come out from among them oh God and be separate God. You said then will you receive us unto you oh God. And you will be a father unto us and we would be your children. We would be your people and you would be our God. And the alcohol and the drugs and the lust. I forgive my dad! I release him from my heart! I surrender to you Lord! I'm done fighting I give it all up to you! Yeah they coming out good now. You think these brownies gon' come out like mama use to make 'em? Nobody can make 'em like mama made 'em. I know I would always tell her that she could make a fortune for making brownies. And once I made it to the pros she would have her own shop. That's the only way they would've got out 'cause mama wasn't giving that recipe to nobody. Man you sure got that right! Tatiyanna what's this? What's what? Oh that's nothing! Nothing? It sure looked like something to me! Let me ask you something. You've been going by Rico's house? That's none of your business. None of my business? I'm your brother and I'm suppose to look out for you. You said it right your my brother. Not my daddy. It's none of your business. Tatiyanna you don't know Rico. Don't let him fool you with this silly lover boy act. He can get pretty aggressive and he goes around school dating girls with one goal in mind. Yeah whatever. I'm serious I know Rico and I don't think you should be dating him let alone going to his house. Tell me y'all haven't been sleep... And if we have? Let me ask you something. Do you think God would be okay with you sleeping with somebody, that you're not married to? God this. God that. You act like you've been an angel all your life! I haven't but I've turned away from my old ways and I'm no longer living in sin. And now you think you can tell everybody what to do. Look I'm just trying to look out for you. I know Rico and he's not the person you think he is. You and daddy need to leave me alone and let me live life how I want to. I need to call Damian and get this right. Hello? Hey man you busy? On my way to Rico's house. What's up? I don't even know where to start. Well it's really good to hear from you man. After that last time we spoke I was starting to wonder if we'd ever talk again. Yeah God really started showing me myself and I hated what I saw. I'm so sorry for blowing up on you and for the person that I've been. I'm sorry for taking my aggression and my confusion out on you. I realized now how hard it must've been for you to know the truth and not be doing it. I just want to apologize for being so inconsiderate. Hello, you still there? Yeah man I'm here I'm just speechless. Did something happen? Well honestly man I got tired of being sick and tired and I got fed up with my life. I knew there had to be something different because if not I knew all hope for me was gone. I knew I couldn't go on living the way I was living, so I went to the only place I figured I can find out answers. I literally was seeking a place of refuge and I found it at your church. I went there and I met this man who turned out to be a minister. Wow I've been thinking a lot lately about getting my life back together. Hey Damian that's my dad. Let me call you back. Oh okay. Later. You didn't have to get off the phone. I just came in to tell you that I'm about to go back to work. Y'all take of the house tonight. That's fine I'll text Tatiyanna and let her know. Text her? Where she at? She said something about Allison's house. Just make sure she gets in this house at a decent time, okay? - Okay. - Alright. Hello? Why you not texting me back? I'm busy. Busy doing what? Studying. Studying? Okay studying with who? What does it matter? Because I want to know! Look I told you I'm changing my life. If I was studying with anyone it would most likely be one of my team mates. You know? Somebody who wouldn't tempt me. Whatever. What? I don't even know why I'm explaining myself to you. We're not even dating anymore. So Paul we agreed to be friends so as a friend I text you to check upon you but you're too busy tied up with whoever, you're not replying to any of my messages. I'm at home studying by myself. I'm not tied up with nobody but God. Oh you're by yourself? Well I'm on my way. Man why did I say that? Do you believe in God? I guess, never really think about it though. Why you ask? I was just wondering. You ever thought about getting saved? Man I don't know. Why you asking all these questions? I just been thinking about it a lot lately. Okay you say that like it's going to change something. Well if I did it would change a lot but it would be for the best. What you mean by that? We're gonna have to stop sleeping together. I don't think God's okay with that. We've been together all this time and you ain't never have a problem with that. Even beyond that what if I get pregnant or what if we get caught? Get caught? Girl we ain't get caught yet. But you don't know what's gon' happen if we keep taking chances. Man I see you really buggin. Look I just think it's time for a change. I love you but we just need some space for right now. I don't want to keep disappointing God. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, let me get this straight. You love me, but don't want to be with me and why all of a sudden you care about what God thinks? Look all I'm trying to say... Man listen! We together and always will be. You ain't going nowhere and I ain't either. Ain't no giving each other space. I like things the way they is and you gon' like it too! Man I knew this was gon' happen I'm leaving. Didn't I say you ain't going nowhere! Wait what'd you just say? I said you ain't going nowhere! I said. Let me go. Stop let me go. God how did I get here? Come on Bae you know how much I care about you. I mean I just got caught in the moment I ain't trying to lose you. Come on at least talk to me. Look I just got a lot I need to think about and I'd rather be alone. At least take your phone. Rico stop! What are you doing? Let me go! Get back in the house. Stop! I know that's not Tatiyanna. Go! Stop! Let me go! Stop! Man what you doing? Man Damian get back in the car this ain't got nothing to do with you! It's got everything to do with me she's like my sister! Tatiyanna get in the car! Don't even look at her! Lord please don't let this be Nina. Where's your key? Tatiyanna what's wrong? Everything! What are you talking about? Everything you said was right! It'll be alright sis. Now God want you to front slide so you can bring some of them other back sliders back to sliding back! Get on back in the church! Get on back where you use to be! Stop feeling sorry for yourself! Get your Bible in your hand and walk in Jesus name! Let nobody stop you or turn you around. Stand up on your feet everybody! Alright man I'm starving. I'm about to go. About to get out of here. We'll catch up with you later. Okay. Alright T. Bless Him preach! Bless Him. How you doing? Good. I want to introduce you to my sister. Tatiyanna this is minister Eathan. Hello. How you doing? Hello. Finally get to meet you. Mmm hmm. Did you enjoy yourself today? I did it was real nice. Everything he said I needed to hear. Especially when he was talking about forgiving everybody and letting go of the past. And it's not just okay to just to come to church. You gotta build a relationship with God. It was nice. That's good. That's good and you know a relationship is not just about coming to God only when you need something and it's not just about a verbal confession with the mouth but a relationship with God is action. You know the Bible says if you love me he said you'll keep my commandments and that's what it's all about. Dad! You decided to come? Yeah. Minister Eathan this is my dad. How you doing? I'm doing good Adrian Vincent. Adrian. It's nice to meet you. It's nice to meet you I've heard a lot of about you. Hopefully good things. All good things. All good things. I've seen the affect that you've had on my son and it's caused me to make some changes in my life as well. In fact, if you have a moment maybe I can speak with you in private. For just a minute. Yeah we can go in the back, excuse me guys. ♪ We invite you in ♪ ♪ We invite you in ♪ ♪ We invite you in ♪ ♪ In this place ♪ ♪ We We We invite you in Jesus ♪ ♪ Oh Lord We invite you in. ♪ ♪ Come and rest ♪ ♪ In ♪ ♪ In ♪ ♪ In ♪ ♪ This place ♪ ♪ Holy Spirit ♪ ♪ Holy spirit ♪ ♪ You are welcome ♪ ♪ You are welcome ♪ ♪ Come and rest ♪ ♪ In this place ♪ ♪ In this place ♪ ♪ Holy spirit ♪ ♪ Holy Spirit ♪ ♪ You are welcome ♪ ♪ You are welcome ♪ ♪ Welcome ♪ ♪ In this place ♪ ♪ In In In this place ♪ ♪ We invite you in ♪ ♪ We, We invite you in Jesus ♪ ♪ We invite you in ♪ ♪ Oh Lord we invite you in ♪ ♪ We invite you in ♪ ♪ In this place ♪ ♪ In this place ♪ ♪ We invite you in ♪ ♪ We invite you in ♪ ♪ Thank you Jesus ♪ ♪ Thank you Jesus ♪ ♪ Hallelujah ♪ ♪ Rest In this place ♪ ♪ Come and rest Jesus ♪ ♪ Come and rest Jesus ♪ ♪ Oh Lord ♪ ♪ Rest In this place ♪ ♪ Come and rest in this place ♪ ♪ Come and rest ♪ ♪ In this place ♪ ♪ This place ♪ Hallelujah!

And now I present to you at this time your pastor. Pastor Adrian. Amen give God some praise for this wonderful choir. Refuge Temple Ministries Deliverance Choir. Amen? Hallelujah. I know many of you might be wondering as to why we've been collaborating with this other ministry. And I will get to that. But first off I want to do something that I don't normally do. This morning I would like to speak to you all from my heart is that alright? Amen. Saints I stand before you all, today full of Godly sorrow. As many of you know, that this past year for my family and I has been a very tragic one with the lost of my wife Leah. For this tragic incident I hold myself completely guilty for it because as the head of my household I'm responsible for everyone in my household, as well as their actions. Saints with that guilt I'm also guilty of preaching to you all only half of the word of God. The half that was convenient for me and was comfortable for most of you. Saints with that guilt I'm also guilty of verbally abusing my family. I would tell them exactly what was on my mind and expect for them to deal with it the best way they could. I've let my children down. I've driven my wife to a point, I now understand clearer than ever the scripture that tells us that there is death and there's life in the power of your tongue. I once heard a man of God say that anger itself is not sin, But it's when you use that anger in the wrong way or for the wrong purpose it becomes of evil. Let me ask you a question how many fools do I have in the house tonight? Nobody. The Bible says that anger rests in the bosom of a fool. And if you have any anger if you have the temper or the frustration as I've once had. Then who are you really? Because of my anger I've lost something valuable. And because of my foolishness I've thrown away something irreplaceable. You see, everything that grows has a root. And because I nurtured and watered one tiny seed of inconsistency, It has grown into a great vine and I've allowed it to choke the life out of my family. Because of me, I won't ever get back the warm embrace of sister Leah. Because of my foolishness. Often times I just sit down and I just ask God and I would just cry. God just one more time God! If I could just hold her hand just one more time! God if I can just hold one more conversation with her. What would I tell her how would I make it different? Saints, are your eyes still closed this morning? How much will it take? Does blood have to be shed on your carpet also for your eyes to be open today? My prayer this morning is that, is that your eyes will be open. That you will see clearly before another loved ones eyes will be permanently closed. Saints I feel as though, I feel unworthy to be before you this morning. In fact I feel as though it would be unfair to you all if I were to continue to Shepard this church. With that being said from this moment forth I relinquish my rights as the pastor of this church and I will bring to you a man of God that actually lives the life that he preaches about. A man of God that has helped my children with their unbelief and with their hatred towards me and through their change my eyes have been open. He's no stranger to you all. You've seen him in our retreats, you've seen him in our camp meetings. I want you all to welcome with me your minister and mine, Refuge Temple Ministries own minister Eathan Williams. Amen. Come on give Jesus a big hand praise. Hallelujah. You know It takes true humility for someone to do what Pastor Adrian just did. And the Bible teaches us that we should be clothed with humility. It goes on to speak about those that humble themselves he said they will be exalted in due time. You know I'm humbled and I respect Pastor Adrian so much for the decision he's made of his own will. The Bible teaches us that in the last days he said perilous times would come. He said how men would be lovers of themselves more than lovers of God seeking to do what they desire what makes them feel good rather than seeking the one that created us for his own pleasure. God almighty. It goes on to tell us they'll have a form of godliness, look just like the church, but deny the power thereof. The power that causes a man to change from one creation to another. The Bible says it like this in second Corinthians chapter five. It says how a man can be a new creature. He said old things would be past away and all things would become new and all things would be of God. But it takes something in order to become a new creature. Today I want to talk to you about that something that it's going to take for a man to change. Ask yourself this question. The truth that you have believed all the way up until this point. Has it made you free? Are you still lying? Still cursing? Still full of deceit and unforgiveness? Still drinking? You can be free today. I want to talk to you today about receiving the Holy Ghost. Oh yeah I remember that. Hey you remember my first football game? Yeah. Man I was so happy when I caught that ball. I just knew everybody would be excited if I could make a touch down. And so I ran as hard as I could. Man I felt so untouchable. And I can remember them screaming out my name. Paul. Paul. Then you realized it was cause you were running the wrong way. Oh so now you decided to get off the phone? Naw I'm playing man I'm just excited. That was my mom on the phone. She said her and my dad are getting remarried. Really? Yeah. Man look at God! You see what can happen if you give your life over to him? He'll cause everything else to fall into place. That's right. You know I felt like I was having to give up everything when I came back to this ministry but I didn't realize he was just giving me so much more in return. I know exactly what you mean. For me giving up my church was the hardest thing I ever had to do. I guess because I tried to build it up into something that I wanted to my expectations but I realized it was never mine to begin with. Ever since I gave it back over to God put it in his hands he made it into something that I could never do on my own. He did the same thing for me with football. Man I was running my little football career in the ground. Going off on my coach. Getting suspended from the team. Man I was losing it. But after I gave everything to God he turned it all around for my good. Took a lot of apologizing but it all was worth it. So now you then went from running the wrong way to running God's way right? Speaking of football. I know by now you decided which college you're gonna play for right? I got one in mind. So you decided to stay home huh? Yeah I really wanted to stay connected to the ministry and I believe God has a work for me here. Hey guys look over here! ♪ To God be the glory ♪ ♪ To God be the glory ♪ ♪ To God be the glory ♪ ♪ For the things you have done ♪ ♪ You have done ♪ If y'all don't mind before I bring up the speaker tonight I just want to give a brief testimony about him. As you may or may not know he's my brother and if it wasn't for him I would not be standing before you tonight. I can honestly say that he practices what he preaches and his life truly lines up with the word of God. And because of the example that he set I'm here before you today. After watching him I begin looking at myself and seeing how much I needed to be changed and I started seeking God and just repenting of everything that I knew wasn't like him and he finally filled me with the Holy Ghost. And none of that would've happened if it wasn't for my brother and the example that he set before me. So without further ado I present to you the speaker for the night my brother Paul Vincent. Amen. Can you all give Jesus Christ a great big hand clap? I see a lot of you brought your notebooks and your Bibles, that's good. If you will can you please turn with me to Ephesians chapter five verses 15 and 16. The title of tonight's message is Redeeming The Time.
