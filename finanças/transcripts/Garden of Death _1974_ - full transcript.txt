(heavy breathing) (door opens) - Mrs. Burrows? (breathing heavily) (footsteps approaching) (rustling) (thud) (footsteps departing) (door closes) (gasping) (eerie music) (gasping) (clattering) (gasping) (gasping) (footsteps approaching) (gasping, clattering) (gasps) (priest talking indistinctly) (slow, dramatic instrumental music) (car drives up) (car door closes) (car door closes) (footsteps approach) (doorbell rings) (footsteps approach) (door opens) - Can I get you something to drink? - Oh, I'd love a Bloody Mary--and don't go easy on the vodka. - The same, only do go easy on mine. (birds chirping) - Europe can make you forget. Especially Rome. I went to Rome after my divorce. Get brainwashed. Worked too. When Rome got through with me, my mind was a completely blank slate, ready for the next disaster. - (scoffs) Oh, you're always over-dramatizing. You know you're a survivor. - That's the trouble. Everyone says, "Helena will survive." (inhales) And they turn to someone else who they think needs help. - Well, it's better you went, and you know it. It's good to be strong. And you're not half as bad as you pretend. - (laughs softly) You're right about one thing. Beware of the weak. They're the real killers. (thuds) - There are enough flowers. I thought you'd gone? - I hadn't realized your garden was still around. - What about him? I mean, what's going to happen to him? - He was a good gardener; he's just not needed here anymore. - I've never seen him before. - Well you and John were away a long time. He hadn't been here all that long before Dorothy got sick. - Oh I'm sure he won't have any trouble finding another job. Now Fred, as far as the clothes, the arrangements, Ellen and I will do what we can today, and then if we have to, we'll come back tomorrow. You just tell us what you need. - Ellen, Helena, I don't-- - Yes yes, - now you go to the office. I'm sure you have a business lunch or something. We'll be alright. - Well I-- - Well I do have an appointment with Bob at one. But I can-- - Helena's right, Fred. - Go along now. And as soon as John comes home, you must come over for dinner. - I will. - Bye. (footsteps depart) (birds chirping) - Feels like skin. - The whole garden's fantastic! They were only away a little over three months. It was certainly never like this when we left. Helena, what happened? - What do you mean? - She went so quickly. When I saw her last, she was just pregnant. Blooming! Really, blooming. - That was it, you know, I saw it. It was uncanny. It was as though while the baby grew, she got sicker and sicker. The baby and the tumor at the same time. - Horrible! Oof. - Look! - [Ellen] Oh, he's saying goodbye to his garden. He must've loved it here. - [Helena] So I heard. Dorothy told me. - What did she tell you? - That he was wonderful. - [Helena] He really is something, isn't he? Not what you usually find in the tropics. - (whispering) Helena! (birds chirping) (rustling) - Thought you'd like these. - Oh they're beautiful! (glass clinks) Yes I do. - Thank you very much, Carl. - They're lovely! Carl, I suppose you need a job now? - I need a garden. - Well I have one. Not like this, of course. My name is Mrs. John Bennett, I live at Via Tintio. I'll talk it over with my husband. Why don't you come by tomorrow, about noon? - Thank you. (footsteps retreat) - Well. - Well what? It would be wonderful to have a really nice garden. - (laughs) I don't blame you a bit. (laughs) - [John] If I hadn't raced for that plane last night, I'd have been stuck another day in New York. (cup clinks) These district managers aren't worth a damn. - Well, you're home now. (glass clanks table) - Thank God. (saucer clanks table) - Have you spoken to Fred? - (laughing) Ellen, I just got back. I'm not up to 18 holes yet. - I mean about Dorothy. - Oh! (utensils scrape) Well I'll call him after breakfast. I have no idea what to say to him. - Say you're sorry. (fork scrapes) He's staying at the club. - Oh? What happened? - Oh nothing, he--he just wanted to get out of the house. John, uh, Dorothy had a wonderful gardener. Naturally, Fred's going to have to let him go. And I thought it might be nice to have some new landscaping around here. Some.... beautiful flowers and plants. - [John] What's wrong with Ralph? - Well Ralph is really a yardman. I'd like the garden to be something special. I'm alone here a good bit, and well, it sort of keeps me company. Fred's garden is absolutely fantastic. - Well, fine. (fork scrapes) If you think you really need more flowers, I guess it's alright. - Do you want to-- - But you're gonna have to hire him and arrange everything. This is a very heavy month for me, and I just don't even have time to think about it. - Well, how are the darlings of the international colony this morning? (chair scrapes) Lisa, I'll have some coffee please. - Helena, what are you doing here so early? I thought the morning light never touched that perfect face? - John, love, if you were around more often, you'd realize that your wife and I work ourselves to the bone! Why this morning, we have a meeting with the ball committee. Ellen, I thought we might drive down together. - That's fine Helena. - Good. Thank you, Lisa. (saucer clanks table) - Sorry I can't stay, but I have a few meetings myself. - What time do you want dinner? - I'm not sure that I can make dinner. You'd better go eat, and I'll pick up something in town. - But John, it's your first day back. You promised! - I'm sorry. I'll try to get away. After all, I have to keep up with the bills. - I'll take you, rather than a gardener, any time. - Don't be silly, darling. Helena. See you soon! (footsteps depart) - Have a good day John! - Ellen, it's divine! You have your own personal gardener! - (laughs) A gardener is hardly personal, Helena! - This one is. - [Lisa] Senora! - Yes, Lisa? - [Lisa] There is someone at the kitchen door, and he said you tell him to come. - Oh, that must be him. Excuse me a minute. I'll start him off, and then we'll go. (shaking) (footsteps approaching) - Oh Carl! I'm so glad you could come. - I've been looking around your grounds. There's a lot of work to be done. I'd like to work here if you'll have me. - Oh yes! I, uh, we do want you. Now um, as for salary? - That's not important. You'll be fair. - Yes, I um, I'm afraid I don't have time to go over things now, but they uh-- - That's alright, I'll find my way around. - Well, thank you Carl. We'll organize tomorrow. (footsteps approaching) - He certainly don't look like a working man around here! - Rosa! - You're so right, Rosa. Maybe that's why he's such a great gardener. Ellen, we really must be going. (footsteps departing) (birds chirping) (soft footsteps) (crunching) (car engine humming) - [Helena] God, the luncheon! Someone ought to tell Harry, that no matter how you over-decorate your table, the food has to be edible. (ice clinks) - Oh it wasn't that bad. I liked the dessert. (glasses clink) - He's a little stingy on that too. - Mm. - Well, what are you going to be? - I dunno, I have to think about it. (ice clinks) - Gods of mythology, it's a fun idea. - I think it's kind of ironic. (laughs) It'll be interesting to see what gods people choose to be. - Oh I know a couple of very good candidates for Marcus. (rustling) - (giggles) - Mrs. Bennett? If you want to fire me, you'd better tell me yourself! - Ralph, what's the matter? - I'm an old man, Mrs. Bennett, I'm not so fast no more. De acuerdo? But I deserve more than just sending around some young animal to tell me to get moving. - Well no one wants to fire you, what happened? - He just look down at me. Como se yo no fuera nadie. "You won't be needed anymore," he says. Just like that. - Well there must be some misunderstanding. - Gets right to work, doesn't he? - Mr. Bennett coming home tonight? - I think so. Don't worry, Ralph, - Then I'll-- I'll straighten this out! - I'll talk to the man that hire me. Then if he wants to have me fired, then I know I'm being fired! (mumbles in Spanish) - (tsks) Well, well. Trouble already. Darling, I must go. Thanks for the drink. And good luck. - Hmm, thanks. (glass clinks) (footsteps depart) (birds chirping) - Why Carl, what are you doing? - Just getting things set up right, Mrs. Bennett. Told you there was a lot to do. - What did you say to Ralph? - Mrs. Bennett, you didn't tell me you had anyone else. I don't work with anyone else. - [Ellen] Carl, Ralph is an old man. He's been with us a long time. I've no intention of letting him go. - Mrs. Bennett, if you want this place to be what it can be, I have to have a free hand to work. - Well, perhaps there are other things you can do. Something less strenuous, perhaps? I'll think about it. - Yes. (slow dramatic music) (water flowing) (clattering) - Lisa-- (footsteps approaching) the flowers on the breakfast table this morning were beautiful! - I didn't do that, senora. He did. I don't touch anything in the garden. - (laughing) Carl? (footsteps departing) Isn't it fantastic, Rosa? He's only been here a few short weeks, and already everything's changing! Things seem to be growing everywhere! (rustling) - Yes ma'am, he has the power. - Well I'd say he has a green thumb. Have you ever heard that expression, Rosa? - (laughing) Oh yes, senora! But I don't mean that. It's just not natural, the way everything is growing so fast! - Well maybe he's a magician! (slow dramatic music) (footsteps receding) (rustling) - Oh Carl! I didn't see you. Would you cut me some of these for the house, please? - No Mrs. Bennett. - (laughs) What do you mean, why not? - These stay in the garden. I have something else for you. - Oh, but I love these! What do you have? (water splashing) - Rosa! Look! Isn't it lovely? And Carl has a dozen more he's bringing in for the party tonight. - I never seen blooms like that before. - You should see the greenhouse! Rosa, Carl has a present for you. Carl? (mysterious music) - No ma'am. This is not even the time when they bloom. - Well isn't it super, how he's forced it? - Oh yes, senora. If it's alright for you, I'll let you put it out in another part of the house. - Rosa! We brought it for you! - But I don't want it. I don't like things around when I am preparing food. - Rosa, you have a whole window full of pots! - That's different. They are mine. They don't do so well. But this, I won't have it in the kitchen! - Alright, Rosa. Be silly. Come on, Carl. I know a perfect place for it. (footsteps depart) (slow instrumental music) - Well, (thuds) that does it. Everything perfect. Hasn't Mr. Bennett come in yet? - No I don't think so, senora. - Oh dear. Everybody's due in 20 minutes. (footsteps approach) - Hi. - Hi! (kissing) - Betcha thought I wouldn't make it. - Well you almost didn't. Well, are we elegant enough, for your Mr. Whatever-his-name-is? - I'm sorry, darling. He and his wife are leaving tomorrow, and I wanted to entertain them. You know, my deal with his firm will buy us a dozen new gardeners. - Oh, I don't mind John. I just hope I like him. Now hurry up and get dressed! - Okay! (footsteps departing) - Rosa, remember, we're going to have coffee and liqueurs in the living room. - Yes. - Thanks. (footsteps depart) (door opens) (rustles) - (calling out) John, can you come in and zip me? - Just a minute! Gah dad! Ellen! What's all this mess doing in the bathroom? - [Ellen] What mess? (rustles) What is it? - Who'd all these goddamned (rustling) plants come from? I just cut myself on one. (clatters) (bandage rustles) - Oh John, I'm sorry! Here. - If you want to turn this whole house into a jungle, okay. But not my bathroom. - I'm sorry, I didn't know they were here! Carl is such an incredible worker. He brings plants into the house and places them. They seem to appear like magic. (smoothing) - You tell him to slow down. Keep those damn things outta my bathroom. Damn place is beginning to look like a funeral parlor. - Is not! It's beautiful and you know it! (bell buzzes) - Oh dear, there's the bell. Hurry up and get dressed. (clattering) (lively music) - Helena? - Oh darling, I can't drink brandy, not after all that wine and everything, it'll destroy me! I'd like um, a light scotch and water, please. (birds chirping) - I'm so delighted Helena could bring you. Seems strange we've never met. I've heard her speak of you so often. - Call me Max, please. - Thank you. - But it is not so strange. I do not come home often. Well you must come more often. (clattering) I think it makes Helena happy. - Helena and I are old friends. Your garden is very beautiful. - Well thank you. - You two so cozy about? Not talking about me, are you? - Telling me nothing I don't know, Helena. - Max just admired my garden. - Oh, the change is spectacular! What's it been, a month or so? - Not very long. - And your plants on the coffee table are absolutely lovely tonight. They don't come from a greenhouse, do they? - Oh, they're all homegrown. - Oh, Mrs. Bennett, you're teasing us. - Nope. - What do you mean? - Did you see the coffee table? - Mm hmm. - The pots are pretty, aren't they? - Pretty? I happen to have a friend who is a director of the botanical gardens. A few months ago, he called me, and asked me to help him purchase some very rare orchids. The price for the few available plants was $3,000. - Wow! - Oh! - What does that have to do with Ellen? - I was invited to see the plants after they arrived. Now I imagine my surprise, Ellen, to see the same rare flowers scattered over your coffee table. - Oh my goodness, Ellen, I had no idea! - Well Max, you must be mistaken, really. - How wildly extravagant! - Oh, this is silly, Helena. Max, it just can't be possible. They probably just look like them. - Hmm, maybe. I'm no expert. - But Ellen, what if they are real? - Well they can't be, Helena. Don't bring this up to John. (footsteps approach) - Can I get anybody a drink out here? - (clears throat) - Max, what are you telling these ladies out here that's keeping them so spellbound? - Oh Max was just making a suggestion for Ellen's costume, (ice clinks) for the ball. - Well, Ellen, did he solve your problem? - Well, I'm not sure. - What's the idea? - Max, tell John your idea about the, um, (snaps), the Greek myths! - Your wife should be Persephone. - Who? - [Max] Persephone, goddess of flowers and spring. - Oh Ellen, that's perfect! - Uh now wait a minute, I don't know much about mythology, but (laughs nervously) wasn't she raped or something? - Was she? - [Max] In a way. The god of the dead, Hades, fell in love with her, kidnapped her, and made her his queen, in the land of the dead. - Well that doesn't sound very pleasant. - Oh dear, Max, it's quite dreary. - Well not really. You see her mother found out what happened, and made a bargain to get her back. - [Helena] (giggles) - Now every year, Persephone spends about six months on earth, and six with her husband. - I like that! (laughs) - It's very poetic. - I'll drink to that! My own flower girl. (clasps) (laughs) My wife and that garden of hers, are gonna bury us under flowers, if we don't watch out! - [Ellen] (laughs softly) - John, would you mind getting me another scotch? - One scotch, coming up. (footsteps depart) - Thank you, Max, for your idea. - Oh Ellen, you must be Per--what's her name? - Persephone. - (whispers) Persephone. Oh yes, you can have a lovely costume, all.... (gasps) soft colors and flowers! - (laughs) - I just might. And you? - [Max] Don't say it. Let me guess. Helena will be Venus! (laughs) - What's wrong with that? Nobody said she was 19. The way I understand it, she was a woman of.... some experience. (Ellen and Max laugh) - Helena, you're marvelous. - Here you are. (ice clinks) - Thank you. - Darling, the Nesbitts are leaving soon, and I've said that we'd lead them into town, and have a nightcap at the hotel. We can all make a night of it. - Hmm. I'm afraid you have more staying power than I have. Helena, I think we must leave. (glasses clank) Thank you for a very beautiful evening. I've never been entertained by Persephone before. - (giggles softly) - Isn't he sweet? Oh life's so unfair! How did I know he was going to turn into somebody terrific? Good night darling. (kisses) - Bye. Thanks for a beautiful evening. I'll call you tomorrow. - Okay. - Good night. - Night. (footsteps depart) John, I didn't want to go into town. It's so late. Can't you just let them go? - Not now. Look what's the big deal? We just go in and have a drink-- - But you don't need another drink. And I promised Domenica that I'd warm up with her at 8:30 in the morning. (indistinct conversation in background) - Alright. You stay, I go. (footsteps depart) - Is Mrs. Bennett coming with us? - Well, no. She's very, very tired, and seems that she has an early tennis date or something like that. (footsteps receding) - Ellen, dear, will you be my driving partner into the city this evening? - Well, I'd love to Mr. Nesbitt, but I'm afraid I'm going to be a stay-at-home. John's gonna go with you though. - I'm terribly disappointed. I thought this was my big chance. - (laughs) Well, we'll have another. It was wonderful having you and Mrs. Nesbitt out here. - Thank you, dear. - Mm hmm. - The next time you come, you'll have to stay with us. - Thank you. - Good night. (footsteps depart) - Remember tomorrow, Ellen. - Right. Get a good sleep. (laughs) - Okay. Thank you. - (laughs) Night night. - Night. (door closes) (mysterious music) (clacks light switch) (footsteps recede) (clacks light switch) (footsteps approach) (clacks light switch) (footsteps approach) (clacks light switch) (footsteps approach) (rustling) (splashes) (splashing) (music crescendos) (footsteps running) (rustling) (birds chirping) (thuds, gasping) - Senora, (footsteps descending) I think we better call a doctor. He was alright yesterday. I saw him working in the garden. - Carl? What's wrong? - No, it's Ralph! - Oh. - He coughing blood. - Oh dear. Get Dr. Lombard. - And don't worry about the other one. He know how to keep sickness for heself. - Lisa, on second thought, you go stay with Ralph, and I'll get Dr. Lombard. (footsteps depart) - He'll be in the hospital for a while. (door opens) But then what? - I've spoken with his daughter. She wants him to come out and stay with her in the country. (footsteps approach) - [Ralph] I don't wanna go to any damn hospital. But maybe it won't matter. (footsteps ascend) I'm not needed anymore. - Well of course you're needed! You'll be back with us soon. - It will just be for a little while, Ralph. Jerry, help her out into the car, will you please? (footsteps recede) (car door opens) (shuffling) (thuds) (car door closes) (car door opens) - It's going to be alright, Ralph. (car engine starts) (car drives away) (footsteps approach) - I'd like to recommend the garden as a tour, for the hospital fund. - Mm hmm. - Oh didn't I tell you Gladys? Actually, Ralph didn't do this. Ellen has a new gardener, Carl. - It's impressive to realize the years of devotion it takes, to develop something like this. - [John] Ellen! - Oh John! How is he? - He's fine. We got him settled down. Doctor feels he can go to his daughter's in a week or two. - Oh that's better. - Darling, I'd like you to meet Miss Stone. This is my husband, John. - How do you do? It's so delightful to meet people like you and your wife, who care so much about the land. - Well thank you. But it's my wife and her gardener who do all the work. She's a real flower girl. - That reminds me, Ellen. Have you called Mrs. De Santos about your costume? You know she's swamped. - Yes. But I still have to pick out all the flowers for the belt. - Ellen, why don't you use real ones? - Oh I don't know (laughs). The real ones wilt and fall apart. - Why don't you ask your friend Carl? I'm sure he has just the right non-wilting blossom. - John, you must be joking. But I wouldn't be a bit surprised if he did. - It's been a real treat. I do so hate to leave. But you must let me come back soon, to really examine the grounds. - Of course! - Ellen, before we go, I wish you'd call Carl. I do so want Gladys to see him. - Oh now Helena! - Well darling, I just think it would be nice to compliment him for a job well done. Besides, I think Gladys should see what a real serious botanist-type looks like. - (laughs) Why, Helena? Does he have two heads or something? - [Helena] You mean you haven't seen him? - (laughs) No. Should I? - No you haven't, have you John? You've been so busy these past weeks. Let me call him! - No, you stay. (glass clanks) I'll get him and lead him up for the applause. - Helen, I'm sorry to be such a bother. - No bother. It's time they met. - Of course, I believe that while your gardener must be an absolute jewel, the sophisticated choice of the guiding hand deserves-- (footsteps approach) - [Ellen] Here they are! - Ladies, this is Carl. - Oh my! - Oh my what? - Oh, nothing. He looks so young, to have the experience. - I'll be he's had lots of experience. - Oh stop it! - Carl! Mrs. Boardman and Miss Stone wanted to compliment you on your work in the garden. Miss Stone is a member of the horticultural society. So naturally, she understands your work better than the rest of us. - Yes, young man. Well done! - Yes, Carl. The change is really something. Well, uh, Gladys, we must be going. - Thank you, Carl. (footsteps depart) (indistinct conversation) - [Man] I don't get it John. - [John] It's just that she didn't tell me, you know? This guy doesn't even have any references, other than the Burrows. - [Man] Are you trying to say that you think your wife's fooling around? - (laughs) Oh, God no. Ellen's not the type. She couldn't even if she wanted to. (golf cart thuds) Nah, the thing of it is, that she hired this guy. I didn't even see him until the other day. And I don't like him. - You know John, we have a pretty good life here. Sometimes I think it's too good. Not enough big worries. So occasionally, when the little ones come along, they get out of proportion. Now you've got a gardener you personally dislike. So what? You don't have to like your gardener. As long as he does a good job, and your wife's happy, forget it. - I suppose you're right. - What you both need are some kids, to absorb the excess and nervous energy! - We're happy. It's just that Ellen seems so involved with these damn flowers. - Now look, this weekend's Carnival. Have a good time with Ellen, then take a vacation. Take her away for a couple of weeks. - Ellen loves Carnival. We have the ball, then I have three days in London. But I think that we will go away. - That's it. Just get things into balance. - Yeah. (slaps club) (lively guitar music) (car horn blares) (loud chanting and clapping) - [Man] Senora! (shouting in Spanish) (traffic passes through) - (loudly complaining in Spanish) Senora! I'm glad you're back! (claps) For you! Everyone is touching up wrong! - Oh I'm sure we'll get it all straight, Rosa. Why don't you and Feliz check the tray.... - Hello, Lisa. (footsteps approach) Lisa, what do you have in that paper? - It's nothing, senora. It's trash, I'm going throw downstairs. - What trash? - It's nothing. - Well, it must be something. Let me see. (paper rustling) - (gasps) Lisa! Take these in and put them on the bed. (paper rustling) (opens door) (paper rustling) (ominous music) - (gasps) Where did you get these? They're unbelievable! That's not what Mrs. De Santos sent with my costume. - He bring them. Have no business. I find them where he leave them there for you. - Carl? But how did he know? - Who knows? He knows everything that happen here. - Oh I was so disappointed with the paper flowers. But these! - Don't touch 'em! - Senora, please! Let me take them away. - Lisa, what's wrong with you? That was a terrible thing to try to do. - I'm sorry, but it's not alright. It's unlucky! - That's silly. It doesn't bite. It's beautiful! - Don't wear them, senora. - I know you mean well, but you must stop this nonsense! Now Lisa, you have things to do downstairs. - Si, senora. (door closes) (water spraying) - (gasps) Oh John, you're beautiful! But kind of spooky. (squeaking) - Well, I'm your husband the king, aren't I, flower lady? (helmet thuds) I'm gonna keep you locked in the castle forever. - Oh John, I didn't know you'd picked your costume so we'd be a matched pair. That's sweet. - Well we are a matched pair, aren't we? (rustles) - Oh John! I'm all wet. I'll ruin you. Why don't you go downstairs and see to things, and I'll be right there. - Okay. For now. I'll be waiting. (clattering) (laughing, lively music) - Enjoy yourselves. (indistinct conversation) - (mumbles) for me, you handsome man. (kisses) - Hello, Helena. You're a beautiful Venus. Max, how are you? - It's good to be here, John. A fine way to start Carnival. - Where's Ellen? I'm dying to see her costume. - She's not down yet. Helena, do me a favor and go up and drag her down. It's not like her to be this late. - It's probably some disaster. A broken strap. (indistinct chatter) (eerie music) - (knocking) Ellen? It's me, Helena. Put up your party. (door closes) - My God, Ellen! (gasps) Ellen, are you alright? Ellen, is anything wrong? - N-No, no nothing's wrong. Helena, it's good to see you! You look lovely. - Take a sip of this. You've gone pale. You are alright? - Oh yes, I feel marv-- - They're all wild, holding or their hostess. - Oh my god, Helena, I must be losing my mind! - Well I'm losing my cool, I've never seen anything as beautiful as you. Shall we go? (footsteps depart) (lively trumpet music) (indistinct chatter) - If Helena doesn't bring her down pretty soon, there won't be anyone left to greet. (indistinct chatter) (clapping) (indistinct chatter, glasses clinking) (laughing) - I'm sorry I'm so late. I can't think of what got into me. - Anyone who watched you walk down just now, will forgive you. It was worth waiting for. - Thank you Max, but I'm really ashamed. - You look beautiful. - (laughs) Doesn't she? So good, I wasn't about to join her in her grand entrance. - Helena, you told me you had to powder your nose. - Well I did! So I could be jealous alone. - Mrs. De Santos certainly did a beautiful job. - Mrs. De Santos helped. It's the flowers that make the costume. They're all real, John. Courtesy of you-know-who. - You told me that Mrs. De Santos made that costume out of paper flowers. - Well she did, John, but they just didn't work out. And then I found these. - You mean "he" found them. - Well, what difference does it make? I'd like a drink, Max. - Excuse me. John, have a good time tonight. (lively instrumental music) - [Woman] John! John! (indistinct conversation) (laughing) (indistinct conversation) - You're not driving! This is Max's car. We're going with Max and Helena. - I wanna drive! It's my party. - We planned to go with Max, remember? And he's driving, thank God! (rustling) Come on! - Helena, you are the sexiest Venus. I'm gonna drive away with you. - (laughing) (exaggerated kissing) - Of course darling, now you get in. Now we'll all go together, right? (car door slams) (laughs) Oh dear, thank you. (car door slams) - (Slaps) Well, we're off to the ball. - Yes John, we're off. (car engine starts) (indistinct conversation) (car drives away) (eerie music) - That was the loveliest party. It seems silly to go on after your house. - My own flower girl. - Oh John, don't. You're going to crush me! - (yells) Ouch! Those damn things have thorns. - [Helena] Didn't you love the music? It was the best group I've heard in a long time. - [Max] They had style. - There aren't any thorns, John. Why don't you put your head back and rest a little? - [Max] Well, it's a beautiful night. The stars have all come out for Carnival. - [Helena] They always do, Max. Remember? (calypso music) (indistinct chatting) - Oh Ellen, darling. Did you know that John was looking for you? - Oh, what happened? Did Miss Bikini run away? - Oh, now you can't blame him! Saw her leap right off the table at him. - Oh I know. It's all Carnival and fun, isn't it? - I guess so. But once more around in this clash, I won't have an unbroken bone in my body. - Oh! (laughs) Wayne, I'd like to get some air. Would you excuse me a minute? (indistinct chatter) (eerie music) - Ellen? I've been looking all over for you. (calypso music) It's time I had a dance with my flower girl. (laughs) Come on, you can't stand out here all by yourself! Come on, let's dance! (yells) Ow! (ominous music) Those damn thorns! I can't touch you-- - John stop it! - What are you doing?! (calypso music) - I'm sorry darling, it--I didn't mean to hurt you. Are you alright? - Yes, I'm alright. Well. I guess that's the end of it. - I'm sorry, darling, I didn't mean to-- It's just that I can't hold you with.... the thorns. (scoffs) Well, you don't need flowers anyway to be beautiful. (steps down) Come on, let's go. - John, I think I'd better sit down for a while. I'd like a drink. (calypso music) (glasses clinking) (indistinct chatter) - [Max] Here they are now. - [Helena] At last. The two lovers. You found each other. Ellen, what's wrong with your outfit? - Oh, I lost my belt in this madhouse. John, may I have a scotch, please? - Darling, what's that on the back of your dress? - What? - Oh my God, it's blood! - Blood?! (eerie music) Oh John, your hand! (gasps) - 3:30? I can remember when we never used to go to bed at all at Carnival. Just kept going on for days. - You were in no shape to go home, John. - Yeah. (plates clink) I'm sorry I wrecked your costume. - It doesn't matter. I know you didn't mean to. How's your hand? - Oh, it's fine. It's nothing serious. God, I feel awful! - You're hungover, and I'm tired. Maybe we're just getting old. (thuds) - I hate leaving you like this. (footsteps approach) But you think about it. When I get back, you just name the place. Anywhere you wanna go, for three weeks. - It's a nice surprise, John. Thank you. I'll think it all out, I promise. (birds chirping) - Well. Bye. - Take care. (birds chirping) (car door slams) (car engine starts) (car departs) (dramatic melodic music) (footsteps approach) - Carl? (footsteps continue) Carl, is that you? - [Carl] Yes. - Oh, Carl. What are you doing? - Seeing to some plants I've put in. - Well nothing does very well in here. It's too shady. And there's a big rock, someplace around. - These are doing alright. - Yes, I'm sure they are. Carl, I wanted to thank you for bringing the flowers for my costume. It was very thoughtful. - [Carl] I'm glad you liked them. - Carl, um, (laughs softly). Nothing. - (rustling) Mrs. Bennett? - Yes? - There's a surprise for you in the greenhouse. Would you come? - Well I'm afraid I, I don't have time just now. - It'd be too bad to miss it. - Alright, lead on. (rustling) - Really amazing what you've done! - Hey Mrs. Bennett, hold out your hand please. - (gasps) (chiming) Why, it must be some kind of a trick! How did you do that? - Don't know. Here. (rustling) (chiming) - Oh boy! Oh I've never seen a plant like this! (grasshoppers chirping) Well, thank you Carl. It was wonderful, but I--but I really must go. (birds chirping) (footsteps approaching) (telephone ringing) (receiver clacks) - Yes? Helena. (cushions squelch) Oh, a little tired after last night. I wondered if you'd like to spend the night here? John's away, we could have a quiet dinner and talk about everything. Good! See you then. (receiver clacks) (cushion squeaks) (footsteps depart) (slow eerie music) (dramatic music) - [Helena] (shouting) Ellen! Ellen! (footsteps running away) (footsteps running toward) (birds chirping) (slow footsteps) - Ellen, for heaven's sake, what on earth happened? - Oh, I don't know. I don't remember. - What do you mean, you don't know? - Well, I uh, I went to bed, and uh-- - Aunt Ellen. - Oh my god! Jinny, where did you come from? (cushion squelches) - Oh I shouldn't have come so late, I guess. But Robby here was at this party after the airport, and he said he'd give me a lift. I thought I'd surprise you. - That's when we found out you disappeared. I heard the bell ring, I went to your room, it was empty. I was scared witless. And that's when we all started looking for you. - And you--you found me in the garden? - Ellen, do you have a history of sleepwalking? - Well not until now. Well, I'm all in one piece. I guess it was just nerves. Jinny, dearest, I'm so glad you came! You're all going to stay, and you too, Robby, I hope. - No, Mrs. Bennett, I just dropped Jin off. - Oh, stay just for tonight. We have plenty of beds. We need a man around the house. - [Robby] Okay. - Good! Now let's all go to bed. We'll sort things out in the morning. - Robby's a nice boy. Too bad he had to dash off like that. - Yes, how long have you known him, Jinny? - I met him last night, at the party. (bird chirping) - [Helena] And off into the night on his bike, how romantic. - (clears throat) Not always wise. - (laughs) Aunt Ellen, I know what you think. - [Helena] What? - That I'm some sort of international hippie. - Well, aren't you? - [Jinny] Yes. - What does that mean? - I don't really know, except you meet people any way you like, wherever you happen to be. And you just hang out. - (claps hands) Sounds like my youth! Except for the blue jeans. - (laughs) Well I hope you're going to hang out around here for a while. - [Jinny] Could you stand me for a week? - Months, if you like. - Great. I miss mother in New York. So I hopped on down here. Once in a while, family's sort of nice. - Well maybe we'll give her a call later tonight. - Who's that? - Who? - That's the gardener, dear. - Oh Carl! Yes, he's unbelievable with flowers. - Well, I'll get my bag. We're getting to town. It's getting late. - Yes, finish up Jinny. We really should get going. - Aunt Ellen-- I'm really kind of tired from the party and trip and all last night. I think I'll just nap by the pool today. Alright? - Well, if you like. I'm afraid it's not going to be a very good day for sun. If you get hungry before I get back, just ask Lisa to fix you up. - I will. - Bye bye. - Goodbye, Aunt Ellen. (rustling) - Jinny's going to stay here and rest. (footsteps approaching) - Oh, I'm not surprised. - Oh? (door opens) - Really Ellen. Sometimes I just don't believe you. - Why? - Well now that she's spotted Carl, I'm sure she's going to develop a great interest in gardening too. - Oh, Helena! - (laughs) I don't mean to be nasty! But-- (door closes) I'll be he has his hands full this afternoon. She's a mighty cute girl. (footsteps retreat) (laughs) (birds chirping) (rain pouring) (thunder booms) (mysterious music) (door closes) (door closes) (thunder booms) (thunder booms) - Jinny? Jin? (door opens) (door closes) (light switch clacks) Jinny? (paper rustles) (thunder booms) (door opens) (door closes) (rustling) - Lisa! You're off, are you? (footsteps approach) In such a rain? - Juan is waiting in his taxi. (umbrella rustles) - Lisa, what time did Jinny leave? (thunder booms) - I don't know. I haven't seen her all afternoon. - Well didn't she say goodbye? (thunder cracks) Her not said she went off on a bike trip with some friends, and she's not coming back. - I have been in the kitchen. I haven't seen her since lunch. - Oh. - I lay out two trays. - Thank you. It's not like her. - Senora? - Oh nothing. It--it's just that I'm disappointed with my niece. She knew that I was going to be alone tonight, and-- Well, usually she's more thoughtful. - (rustling) Well, she is young, senora, and these days-- - Lisa, when you did see her, she didn't seem upset or anything? - No. - I mean, sh-she was by the pool, and Carl was working. You didn't hear-- Oh that's silly. Never mind. (thunder strikes) - [Lisa] Senora, I must tell you. - What? - That Carl should not be in this house. - Lisa, (thunder claps) Carl didn't do anything today. - No, but-- - Oh now don't start in about that black magic! - But it's true! (footsteps retreat) All you see are the pretty plants and flowers. But plants can kill! - Lisa, please! - How, where do you think he get all these strange plants? He has filled this house with dark things! - Carl is not a witch doctor. - But he has the power. When he will something, it happens. And people hear. That is why they come. Sometime, at night, (mumbles) leave candle. - Lisa, Carl has a very unusual talent, that some people don't understand. That's all! - I have been in this house many years! (thunder claps) And I am afraid for you! - I know, but you're being silly! (footsteps) - I can't help you. (rustles umbrella) And tomorrow (thunder claps), they will tell him what I say, and then-- - No one's going to tell anything! We just won't talk about it anymore. - No one? The plants will tell him! Oh, I see him when he walks through the rooms, and they whisper. That is why he brings them, so many. Listening, watching. - That's enough, Lisa. You'd better go along to Juan. (thunder strikes) - You don't know what you take into this house. (voice breaking) (speaks phrase in Spanish) - Lisa, good night. - Buenas noches, senora. (footsteps retreat) (water trickles) (door opens, closes) (mysterious music) (thunder booms) (water trickles) (thunder booms) (thunder booms) (thunder booms) (thunder booms) (thunder booms) - Carl? (thunder booms) (footsteps depart) (door opens) (door closes) (thunder booms) (thunder booms) (water trickles) - Carl? Carl! (thunder strikes) (thunder strikes) (footsteps crunch) Carl? (water trickles) Carl! Carl, I know you're in there! (thunder booms) Carl! (thunder booms) (thunder booms) (water trickles) (cat meows) (cat shrieks) (screams) (thunder strikes) - There now, darling. Are you feeling better (thunder booms) for getting it all out of your system? - You think I've lost my mind. - No! I think you have a bad case of nerves, that's all. No wonder, left alone, and that awful Lisa (ice clinks) and her voodoo stories. (cup clinks saucer) - Helena, I've heard stories, and I've been alone. (thunder booms) But this is serious, Helena! I can't explain! - I know, my love. - I'm so worried about Jinny! Suppose something horrible happened to her? - She wouldn't have left you a note, would she? - But suppose that-- (thunder booms) that Carl did something dreadful, and that's why she left so abruptly. - Robby probably called. She's young. (ice clinks) - I should've called the police! (inhales) But what could I say? - Exactly. Now admit it, now that you're safe and cozy, doesn't it all seem a little, over-imaginative? (thunder booms) - Yes. But that's why I thought that you-- Well you've seen Carl, the strangeness. That you would understand! - Forgive me, Ellen. I have seen Carl. He is compelling. But don't you see, darling? That's sex. He's a beautiful man! - Oh my God, here I am in a nightmare and all you talk about is sex! (thunder booms) - I'm just trying to help! (thunder booms) - Oh, I know. (thunder booms) - Now, we'll go to your house tomorrow, and we'll fire Carl. I'm sure it'll be safe in broad daylight. (thunder booms) - Yes. I suppose I have to. - And just so that it won't be a total disaster for the poor boy, I'll hire him. - Helena, what are you saying?! (door slams) (bird chirps) (door slams) - Listen, love, I won't let you back down. We agreed last night. I'll play detective with you after I hire Carl. - It's wrong, Helena. How can everything look so normal? - What else is it? A thunderstorm, a dead cat. I'll take Carl, and you have a lovely holiday with John. (bird chirping) (footsteps approach) Month from now, we'll have drinks together and laugh about it all. - Ah, Senora Bennett! You didn't tell me you were going out last night. - It was unexpected. Lisa, how is everything? - No one need my breakfast. - Well, we'll just have coffee on the terrace. Come on, Helena. (footsteps approach) - See? Everything is peaceful. - I don't care. There's something horrible involved with Carl. (footsteps advance) - I told you, it's sex. - Oh. - Only you're so damned stiff, you won't admit to yourself you feel it. That's why your nerves are shot. - I have a husband. - Well then call Carl. You really have to, you know. You don't want a repeat of last night. (bird chirping) - Carl? Carl? Oh, Carl! Will you come here please? (rustling) What if he hasn't done anything, and I'm being unfair? - He'll have a good job at my place. I can handle him. (rustling footsteps) - Carl, you've done wonders with the garden. I'll never forget that. But my husband and I are going away, and uh.... Well you're a luxury we just can't afford. But Mrs. Boardman has been very kind to offer you a position as her gardener. - Yes, you've done such wonders with Mrs. Bennett's garden, I've envied her. My own place can use someone like you. You will come, won't you? - If Mrs. Bennett doesn't want me. - Well, as I say, my husband and I are going away. We're--we're not dissatisfied with you. - Not at all. We all think your work is exceptional. (bird chirping) - I'll come. - I'd like you to start today. - Yes, uh, today Carl. Mrs. Boardman's garden needs a lot of work, doesn't it, Helena? - You know where I live. I'll see you this evening. - Carl-- I just want you to know, I'm grateful. - Yes thank you, Carl. Ellen, let's have our coffee. - No, no, no. We've got work to do. - We're not really going through with that checking up? He has two references now, you and Dorothy. I'm satisfied. - If you remember, Dorothy is dead! And I am hardly a recommendation. Come on! (water splashing) - Darling, let's call Max. We could have a nice lunch. - No, no, no. He just-- (receiver clatters) Um. Helena, I know this is silly, but will you take this thing and put it outside the door? - Ellen, you're not serious? - Please, just do it. - Very well. (plant clatters) - Now, who did Carl work for (phone clatters) before Fred and Dorothy? (book rustles) - I know I heard, but I don't remember. (book rustles) - Oh please, Helena, try. I hate to call Europe, but I will. - Alright. Carrie Melendez. The husband's name is Roberto. (rustling) - Well they must be in the phone book. (book thuds) (pages rustle) - Roberto, Roberto.... Yes! (receiver clatters) (dialing) 7, 1, 2, 3, 4. Um, Senor Melendez? My name is Ellen Bennett. I wonder, do you know a Roberto Melendez? Well, the wife's name is Carrie. Oh! Oh, I'm terribly sorry. You're very kind. This is awful of me to ask, but it is important. (dog barks in distance) Thank you. I wondered about her staff, a gardener who worked for her. I'll be very grateful. (rustling) Yes. Salvador? Thank you. Goodbye. (phone clatters) Mrs. Melendez died over a year ago. - (sighing) Oh, that's too bad, Ellen. - You see? He gave me the name of their former houseboy. (thuds) He's a barman at the Acapulco (thuds), and we're going to see him. - Ellen, (thuds) isn't it bad enough, without our meddling? - Don't you see anything? Carl worked for Carrie Melendez; she's dead. He worked for Dorothy; she's dead. - Dear God, coincidence! Dorothy wasn't murdered. - How can you be sure? (slow jazzy music) - Salvador, there's nothing to worry about. We're asking these questions to help Carl, that's all. - I do not care Mrs. Boardman. I did not like him. - [Ellen] Why not, Salvador? - He's a bad man. - I'd like another one of these, please. And another one for her. - Alright. (glasses clatter) - [Ellen] What did he do that was bad? - I cannot say exactly, Mrs. Bennett. But we all knew. (glasses clink) - There, see? He was a loner and they didn't like him, (glasses clink) and that's all. - Well there must be something, Helena. (whispers) No more drinks! (footsteps approach, ice clatters) (glasses clank bar top) - He was bad after the accident. - [Ellen] What accident? - One morning, Mr. Melendez ran into the tree, and killed himself. - Mr. Melendez? Ellen, you didn't tell me-- - [Ellen] How did it happen? - Well, it was a long drive, Mrs. Bennett. It was dark, storm. Missed a turn. - [Helena] Little too much of that? - I believe so. - But what about Carl? What was bad? (indistinct conversation) - Nothing, but he, uh, Mrs. Melendez, seemed to spend much time with him. - There, I told you. - They believe she did it for her dead husband. But I think maybe.... - Did what, Salvador? She uh, she shoot herself. - (gasps) - Dear God! He didn't tell me that! - Well naturally they wouldn't. Don't you think we've had enough of this? Let's go home, Ellen. - Salvador, where did Carl work before the Melendez? - I don't believe it! - Think, uh, yes. Garcia. - [Ellen] Who? - Senor Martin Garcia. - [Helena] He was the director of the international bank, wasn't he? - Yes. That's the one. - Well it seems I've heard about him. Least they're alive. (car humming) (honking) - [Helena] I feel as if you're kidnapping me. - [Ellen] You promised to do this with me when I agreed to let you hire Carl. You know, Helena, I'm doing this for you! - [Helena] Are you, darling? Dredging up all that sad business of the Melendez? And absolutely no real proof of anything bad about Carl? Why don't we go home? - [Ellen] Don't you see anything strange in all this? So many dead. - [Helena] Only that we're running around, to funny places, snooping. I feel like a peeping tom. (doorbell rings) (dog barks) (door squeaks open) - I'm sorry. We should have called. We're looking for Mrs. Garcia. That is, if she's in. - Come in. Come in. (door closes) - [Ellen] We'd like to see-- - (laughs) - [Ellen] Are you Senora Garcia? - You don't like it here? - I don't understand. - What did you come for? - We'd like to ask you some questions about a gardener you once hired, named Carl. My friend has just employed him. - There are--no flowers here. - [Ellen] I see that. - No plants, no flowers. - [Ellen] Yes, but when Carl was with you-- - There were too many flowers; I couldn't move there were so many! I hate the sun. - [Ellen] You hate the sun? - We draw the blinds, and I sit here. And I would rather be the way I am, unlike you. (footsteps circle) - Really? - You like flowers? - (quietly) Yes. - Flowers will kill you. You can laugh, but I can tell you. The air you breathe, the plants, they breathe out poison. And the sun is always too much, so that the plants grow, and it can't stop them. They come and come, and they will kill you. (laughs) Ha! But not me! They can't kill me, because I have no flowers and no sunlight--just a cool day.... and storm. - (whispering) I told you we shouldn't have come! - I know. Perfume is so strong it can-- suffocate you. I know. - [Mr. Garcia] Margarita! You shouldn't be seeing these people. - Oh. I'm terribly sorry. We didn't realize. - [Mr. Garcia] You didn't realize? You had no right to disturb my wife. Can't you see? - We're sorry to have bothered you, sir. - Please go. I'm sorry to be so rude. But please, you must go. - Senor, may we just have a moment to ask-- - No! It's impossible. - Forgive us, senora. - (laughing maniacally) (door creaks open) (door creaks closed) - Thanks. (phone clatters) Well I got it! He worked for the Von Wohls before the Garcias. - God in heaven, aren't you satisfied yet? - What do you mean? - That poor woman was half crazy, and you still don't see what you did. - Well I see that Carl worked for her, and that something terrible has happened to her! - I thought I'd die of embarrassment when you tried to ask him. Now Ellen, I want you to put this out of your mind this instant! (gasps) Oh. - What surprises you, Helena? The flowers? You'll be seeing plenty of them every day now. - If I didn't know you better, I'd say you were jealous. - Well I'm not the one who sees things in terms of sex. - And I'm not the one who's obsessed with her gardener. (glass thuds) - Oh all right, Helena. I'm sorry. It's just that I'm frightened for you. There's something that we're missing to help us see this pattern of evil! - Evil, Ellen, things happen to people! Now, you cannot blame Dorothy's cancer, or Mrs. Garcia's instability on Carl. - You don't understand. Maybe I am wrong. But I beg you, one more call. - What'll it prove? - Well, so far, it might be chance. I doubt it. But if Mrs. Von Wohl is dead or crazy, you're going to have to help me go on. - All right, make it. But if it's all right, then you're going home. - Yes. (phone clatters) (rotary dialing) - Um, Mrs. Von Wohl please? Oh, at the hairdresser's? Mrs. Bennett. An hour. Oh thank you very much. I'll call then. (phone clatters) - [Helena] (laughs) Not from this house you won't! Now you promised to go home and sleep. And you need it. (inhales sharply) She's certainly not dead at the hairdresser's. - Helena. Why don't you come over to my house and sleep? I just can't bear to think of you being here alone with him! - (laughing) And I can't think of anything more fascinating. Now you go straight home. (doorbell buzzes) (door opens) - Yes? - Mrs. Von Wohl? - Yes I am. - Oh, my name is Ellen Bennett. I'm terribly sorry to bother you, but uh, I was in the neighborhood, and I wanted to meet you. I'd like to ask you some questions about a gardener you once employed, named Carl? - Please come in. - Thank you. - But I'm afraid I won't be of much help. (door closes) You see, I never had a gardener. Here. - How do you do? - Nice to meet you. Sit down, please. Can we get you a drink? - Oh, no thanks. I'll just be a minute. I wanted to ask you, have you ever hired a gardener named Carl? - Mrs. Bennett, please sit down. - [Ellen] Yes? - Mrs. Von Wohl has never had a gardener. I employed a young man as a gardener, once, whose name was Carl. - I don't understand. - Of course not. You see, he worked for my first wife. - [Ellen] Oh. - She was drowned in a lake. After that, well, it was she who liked gardening. (car honks) We didn't need a gardener any more. So I let Carl go. - Oh, I didn't realize. - Of course you didn't. It was very awful. We never found the body. Please don't be embarrassed. - Well if I'd known, I'd-- - But you couldn't. - [Ellen] I'm terribly sorry. Would you mind if I used your phone for a minute? I have to call a friend of mine. - Of course. - Thank you. (rotary dialing) (dial tone ringing) (phone ringing) (dial tone ringing) (rotary dialing) (dial tone ringing) (phone ringing) (dial tone ringing) (phone ringing) (dial tone ringing) (phone ringing) (phone clatters) - [Helena] (laughing maniacally) (frenzied music) (laughing) (shrieks) (door opens) (door opens) - Helena! Helena?! Helena? - [Helena] (laughing maniacally) (music becomes more frantic) - Helena? Helena! Helena? Helena! Helena? (footsteps running) Oh Helena! Thank God! - Ellen, don't be upset. - Are you alright? - I'm always never alright. (laughing) Frank can be rather brutal when he wants. Oh Helena, you didn't! - Drunk up the garden path, oh yes I did. - And he was waiting? - He was here, he hadn't left. - (crying) Oh Helena! How could you?! - I was really pretty once. I could do anything, have any man. As your friend, he held me and-- (gasps) Ellen, what are you doing with the ivy? Ellen? - He's ruined you! - Ellen! My arms! The ivy! I can't seem to pull through! - (crying) Oh my poor Helena! - Ellen! Help! The vine is stuck! - (Crying) I can't! It's broke! - [Helena] Ellen, you're pulling them tighter that way! They'll break! - (crying) I can't! Oh my God, Helena, your arms! They're turning into vines! - Oh you stop it, you're hysterical. - (gasping) Where are you going? - Don't be crazy. I'll be right back, I'm going to get the shears! (footsteps running away) - Hurry! Help me. Help me, dear God. - [Ellen] I'm coming, dear! I have the sickle! - Ellen we don't need it! - I told you my dear, I'm going to help you. I'm going to stop them, I'm going to cut them off! - No! Ellen. Just stop. Oh God. Ellen no! - (grunts) - (screams) Aah!! (music becomes more frantic) (thuds and thrashes) (thuds and thrashes) (screams) (screams) - I'm doing Helena! - (screams repeatedly) Oh. - He won't get away with this, darling. I promise! (eerie music) (rustles) (wind blowing) (gun fires) (music becomes frenzied) Carl? (rustling) (wind blowing) (wind blowing) (screams) (gun fires twice) (footsteps running) (footsteps running) (liquid splashing) (thuds) (flicks) (flame catches) (music becomes more frenzied) (fire crackling) (calm melodic music)
