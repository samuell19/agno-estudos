[instrumental music] [mellow music] [music continues] Gallager: Well, this is where it began. This is where it ended. My partner and I were mining for gold in Northern Mexico in the early months of 1911. It was the right place, but the wrong time. The country was in a state of revolution. On the one side was Colonel Ruiz, military head of the federal troops of the province. And on the other side were the lnsurrectos, armed bands of farmers and townspeople ready to sacrifice anyone or anything to get a little taste of liberty and we were caught in between the two of them. How long they had let us alone, we didn't know. Irish! Irish! Irish! Come quick! The pan is filled with it. - Yeah? How does it look? - Come and see for yourself. The best one yet, I think. Let's not get too excited, Marcos. We've seen 'em peter out before, it could happen again. Not this time. I bet on it. Cut the water up there. Bigger than the one last week. Bigger then any of them. That's pretty good. - Pretty good. - It's a big one, Irish. Really big. Didn't I tell you? - Didn't I tell you last week? - Yeah, you told me. I just wanted to be sure. It's been a long time. Twelve years since we first start. The place in Honduras, hot. Stinking hot. Guatemala, then Puebla, Jalisco, can't even remember. Yeah, better forget it. We've sweat enough. Let's get a drink, huh? Man: Marcos! Marcos! Federales. Ruiz is leading them. What do you think? They didn't ride out here to bring the mail. You men get back on the job! Come on, come on. There's nothing to worry about. Alright, back to work. Rivera, take over. Dismount. We've got our prospecting papers. Ruiz cleared them himself. You know it as well as anybody, what he gives, he can take away. Gallager! It's been a long time. - Yes, it has. - Good to see you. My men had a long ride, so we stopped by to fill our canteens. Well... Got a bottle of whiskey up in the shack. Come on, I'll, uh, buy you a drink. Thank you. Last time I saw you, you were just starting to dig here. Last time I saw you, you were just a captain. - Congratulations, Colonel. - Thank you. Next time I see you, you'll probably be be a general. [chuckles] You never can tell. Ah, I wish I could trade places with you, Gallager. Hot, filthy business running this territory. - Help yourself. - Those Insurrectos again. Pascal Orozco and his bandits, Torres and his cut-throats. Nothing but trouble. I've held them down so far, but I don't know how long it can keep on. We need more soldiers, more supplies. It's a bad situation, Gaflagen You didn't ride out here just to tell me your troubles. What do you want, Ruiz? It isn't so much what I want. It's what's best for you. Ruiz: I like you, Gallager. Yeah? How much do you like me? Those Insurrectos, they raid this territory often. What's that got to do with me? They need gold to buy guns and ammunition. What's that got to do with me? I've heard and I've seen you have found gold, quite a lot. What are you getting at? You need protection, I can give it to you. Cheap. Half of all the gold you find. I already have a partner. Oh, be smart, Gallager. Protect your investment. Only half of the gold. I'll make it simple for you, Ruiz. I don't mix in your business. Now, don't you mix in mine. How you run this end of Mexico, that's up to you. I don't care how much you steal. Just don't steal from me. [indistinct chatter] [intense music] You could have had half of the gold. Now you have nothing. [groans] [dramatic music] [grunts] [rattling] Hold it. Now, drop it. [groans] [music continues] [glass shatters] [groans] Turn around. [grunts] Let's go. Gomez! [gunshots] [music continues] After them! [dramatic music] [horses galloping] [music continues] [music continues] - Try. Try to get away, Irish. - Come on, Marcos. Get up! I can't. My back. Go on. Forget the mine. Don't come back. He'll hunt you down. Ruiz will never quit. Someday, he'll find you. Kill you. [groans] Help me, Irish. [dramatic music] [gunshots] [music continues] [music continues] [gunshots] [gunshots] Don't move. Drop the gun. Igunshoq [gunshots] [instrumental music] [music continues] - Are you hurt? - No. - Thanks for the help. - Hey, this man is alright. He makes a good rabbit. He lead those dogs right into us. Says his name is Gallager. Why were they chasing you? If they had any sense, they'd be chasing you. Why were they after you? Look, I don't like all the questions. [gun cocks] I hit gold up in Bonita Canyon. Ruiz jumped the mine, we gave him a fight. You're the one they call Irish? That's right. And you escaped without harm? I lost a mine and a partner, you figure it out. - What do we do with him? Pablo: Federales! Federales! [intense music] He goes with us. [music continues] [instrumental music] [music continues] Who is this? We saved him from the federales. Why did you bring him here? What if he's a spy? I saw him fight the federales today. Did you fight the federales today? Tomas! - Who sent you here to us? - Nobody. He says he had that gold mine in Bonita Canyon. Ruiz took it away from him. Who sent you here? Nobody sent me. I was brought. Give me a horse, take this thing off my eyes and I'll get outta here. You think we're going to let you go so you can tell the federales where to find us? I don't care whether they find you or not. [groans] You oughta wave some of that muscle at Ruiz. [groans] You're tough, mister. I'll bet you're real tough. Tomas! Guard him! - What's his trouble? - Arturo? He has his faults. Nobody's perfect. Arturo! Arturo! She was hurt. She's been shot. What happened? - Federales. - She's lucky. It just missed the bone. Don't touch her. Either you get that bullet out or she'll die of blood poisoning. Can you get it out? I'll make a deal with ya. I'll take out the bullet and you turn me loose. Can you save her? I can try. If you don't, we'll bury you the same day. Get some water boiling. All set? Hang on. Hold still. Hold still. [instrumental music] [Snaps fingers] That's it. How do you know she'll be alright? I don't. When I joined the Insurrecto, these were brand new. They bring you in blindfolded? We started together: Arturo, Carlos and me. - What about the girl? - Raquel? She came a few days later. It was after Ruiz killed her father and mother. Where was their gold mine? No, it was no gold mine with the Noriegas. He wanted their land. Maybe most of all, he wanted Elena, Raquel's sister. What happened to her? Ruiz took her with him. Too bad. The Noriegas were good people, very good people. Carlos and I work on the ranch. We all loved them very much. Tomas... see that they are polished. - Where does Napoleon fit in? - A rancher's son. His family was close to the Noriegas. Raquel and Arturo are pledged to be married. An old custom. The two families arranged it when the boy and girl were still children. - I was married the same way. - Nice custom, no? I don't know. How did you make out on the deal? His father was a very bad judge of women. [laughing] Thanks for the razor. You ought to try that sometime. [Tomas laughing] I like him. You've made up your mind. You're going to Avino. Yes, I... I must find out for myself. It's not worth the risk. Believe me. What's happened to you, Arturo? Danger, risk. You think of nothing else. I'm thinking only of you. You know how much you mean to me. Don't mind me. Go right ahead and I'll wait. What do you want? Well, I'd like to check the bandage or shall I come back after the party? You can do it now. You oughta learn about this stuff. Never know when it's gonna come in handy. Well, you're real brave, general. [Raquel winces] That hurt? Yes, sir, you're a first class heroine. Two days and you're as good as new. It didn't bother you a bit. Is that supposed to mean something? Maybe. I don't know. Look, what're you trying to prove? You look like a female, but that's about all. Just check the bandage. Oh, please. That's all I'm doin'. Alright, you're fine. After today, you can take care of it yourself. I'll be leavin' in the morning. I know. I'm coming along. Someone has to show you the way. You'll be blindfolded. Again'? We {flayed that game comm' 'm. Don't you ever get tired of it? The location of this camp is a secret. We like to keep it that way. I'll ride with you as far as Avino. Well, thanks. Could be an interesting trip. Too bad you're not a woman. You know, I made a big mistake. Yeah? The day we found you, I should've let them kill you. [laughing] [clanking rhythmically] Gitana, you should do somethin' about your pot. In my mother's cantina in the village, we don't have such a pot. This cannot make music. All the time I'm trying to cook, you make music. Gitana, music is half of the world. [clanking] Please be careful. Nothing must happen to you. Promise me you'll take care of yourself. I promise. [Gallager grunts] Carlos: Good fighter that Gallager. Too bad, I think we should've kept him. Arturo: Nobody cares what you think. Carlos: You worried about Raquel, eh? I would worry, too. You speak to me only when you're spoken to. The times haven't changed that much. They've changed much more than you think. [horses galloping] Ah, Torres, my friend. What brings you here? It's important. We've been riding a long way today. You got some place we could rest? Inside. Pablo! Take care of the men. [indistinct chatter] Ah-ha! Uh, pretty good. [sighs] Uh, you know, Torres, today is going to be a very big day in your life. I hope you realize it. So far, it's no different than yesterday. Aah. Ah. With your permission, my friend, you're making a mistake. Today, I, Pasquel Orozco, am going to give you a chance to write your name into history books. Torres is going to be a great man. A great name. Mm-hm. Ahh. Hey! Hey, you got something for me to take with the tequila? - Ah! Ah. - What do you want? I come here because I want to do you a favor. I want to help you. We need no help from thieves and bandits. Bandits'? [chuckles] You got a lot to learn, Torres. Let me tell you this. We're all fighting in the same revolution. It takes all kinds to win a revolution, my friend. The thieves, the saints and the bandits. But all for Mexico. What do you want? I got a plan. You work with me and you'll be well repaid. What kind of a plan? How will you repay us? You'll be rid of Paco Ruiz. I'll take care of that. Now, listen. Ten days ago, my army wiped out the federal garrison at Agua Prieta. Next, I move on Juarez. Now, I can defeat the army there now. If no help is sent to them, we can easy take the city. You, uh, see what I mean? You want us to stop federal reinforcements from reaching Juarez. Especially the army of Ruiz! But how do we stop him? You keep him busy. The day before I move on Juarez, I want your men to attack Ruiz's headquarters. Impossible. We have plenty of men willing to fight. There are no guns for them. Give us a 100 rifles and maybe it can be done. A 100 rifles! I give you a 100 rifles, I'm less a 100 men when I march on Juarez. So this is your offer of help? You ask for everything, you give nothing. Look, I can't take care of all the details. One thing, I know where you can get a shipment of rifles. . You got money? - Hmph! None. The whole plan is wrong anyway. If we attack Ruiz, it would be suicide. The shipment of guns, what kind of money will we need? Enough to pay for 200 rifles. Where, where can we get them? I've told you this before, you have nothing to say here. I'm in command here. And I'm giving you a plan to get rid of Ruiz. Now, are gonna make a deal or don't we? We fight our own battles, Orozco. Your troubles are not ours. The answer is no. The guns, where can we get them? Across the border. I could give you a map. For 200 hundred rifles, how much do we need? Oh, about $5000 American money. Oh, that's not so much. You could find it some place. You're a clever fellow. Five dollars, we're clever. Five thousand, we're not so clever. Maybe you can help us a little bit. Me? I got no money. None. Look, I give you a plan to get rid of Ruiz. I swear I will help you. On my mother's grave, I swear to you. I even tell you where to get some rifles. Now, the rest is up to you. [horses trotting] Well, here we are. Just follow the road. You can walk into town from here. Thanks. How was the scenery? Did I miss much? Oh, no! Ladies first. I'm sorry. No offense. That's just an expression. [chuckles] You really like this playing soldier boy, don't you? Why don't you people use your head? I don't like Ruiz any better than you do. Runnin' around takin' pot shots at him isn't gonna stop him. Why don't you go to Mexico City? Take your complaint to the government. That's my move. A few years ago, we could. No more. Today, when President Diaz appoints a man to rule a province, that man has a free hand. His word is law. Complain all you want, it does no good. The government knows best. So you're gonna change things, huh? You're gonna set everybody straight. Little Joan of Arc in riding pants. [laughing] Why don't you grab a sewing basket and let the men do the fighting? I would... only there aren't enough real men left. [chuckles] Thanks anyway. When I get to Mexico City, I'll send you a postcard. [instrumental music] You shouldn't have come, Raquel. I had to find out, Father. - Did you see my sister? - Yes, my child. I saw Elena yesterday. - You gave her my message? - It's no use. She wants to stay with Ruiz. She says she's going to marry him. I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do. - Oh, but, Father... - Shh! [instrumental music] [bell dings] When's the next train for Mexico City? The next train for Mexico City. When's it due? Well, come on, come on! What's the matter? Do I have to spell it out for you? Yes, Sir. Just a minute, Sir. [instrumental music] Man: Hurry! Hurry! He's in the depot! Hurry! Don't let him get away! [dramatic music] - He's inside. - Shoot to kill. [gunshots] Break the door down! [glass shattering] [music continues] Raquel: Irish! [music continues] [gunshots] [horse neighing] [indistinct screaming] [instrumental music] Why did you do it? You were just begging for trouble. Why? Federales happen to be the enemy. Hmm. Thanks anyway. Figure you can get any help from your friends back at the camp? Why should they risk their lives for us? Well, I don't know, you certainly seemed close enough to Arturo. I should think he'd do something. Arturo used to be a very brave man. I don't know what, but... something happened. Mm-hmm. You picked a great bunch to throw in with. Work yourself into a jam and they forget about you. They saved your life the other day. Looks like a waste of their time, doesn't it? When does it happen, any idea? Probably tomorrow. What's the treatment? - Firing squad. - Huh! That will be quick. Time runs out for all of us. Nothing we can do to change it. [instrumental music] I'd like to prove something. Do you mind? [music continues] Looks like I made the mistake. - Mistake? - Yeah. When I said you weren't a woman. [music continues] [instrumental music] [birds chirping] [music continues] [intense music] Stand back there. Guards! Guards! [gunshots] The keys! Get his keys! [dramatic music] Hurry! [gunshots] [gunfire] [horse neighing] [gunshots] Cover me! [gunshots] Look! [music continues] Igunshoq [clinking rhythmically] [indistinct chatter] [instrumental music] [laughter] [indistinct chatter] Tell me the whole story about Orozco. What did he want? He wants us to attack Ruiz. If we can stop Ruiz from sending reinforcements, Orozco has a good chance of taking Juarez. His army is strong enough to attack the city? Arturo: Of course not. He's sure of it if no reinforcements get there. You talk like an idiot. What he wants is for us to commit suicide. I've told you before the whole northern army is defending Juarez. But, Arturo, if he's right, if the city does fall, the government falls with it. It's a good chance. A chance we should take. I will not risk my people to help Orozco become the big man. Maybe that's a risk we want to take. Arturo, he fights for what we fight for. Tell me, Carlos, did he offer us help? - Will he give us guns? - He'll give us nothing. He has none to spare. He told us where we could get some, over the border. Yes, he told us where. With the gringos! But did he tell us where we can get the $5000 to pay for them? Five thousand? It's just an idea. Irish, where you been, boy? I just did a dance. - Yeah? How was it? - It might work. Huh? Look! Mamma! Mamma! This is my friend. Gallager, this is my mother. You are a very brave man. We owe you our thanks. I owe your son a lot more than that. He got me out of jail. And now I do something nicer than that. I find you a girl. A beautiful girl. Mwah! Well, thanks just the same. I think I've already found one. Hiya, general. I'll buy you a drink. I've been looking for you. Where have you been? Picking up my train ticket. I'm going to Mexico City, remember? Oh, I thought you would stay with us for a while. Well, that's very nice of you, but, uh, I still want that mine. You think they'll listen to you? You think they'll make Ruiz give the mine back? [chuckles] Well, if they don't, they better have some awful good reasons. A very funny joke, Carlos. He's going to Mexico City to complain about Ruiz. When Ruiz first came, we sent a delegation to Mexico City to protest. They never came back. A year ago we sent another delegation to Mexico City. Six men. Only Miguel came back. Maybe you should find out for yourself. Go to Mexico City. Don't forget we have a consul down there. I think they'll listen to him. Maybe you forget that officially you're wanted for murder. Can your consul do anything about that? Join with us. We can fight Ruiz together. You men can't fight the federales with a couple of dozen men, you oughta know that. We could raise an army of men if we had guns to give them. [chuckles] It's a pretty big if, isn't it? There's a way it can be done. We need money. We want some of the gold from your mine. Well, now you make a very funny joke. Well, talk to Ruiz. He's got the mine. But you know everything about it. If we should make a raid on the mine, you'd know where to find the gold. You know that place is like a fort up there. Ruiz probably has some of his best men guarding that mine. That's where you come in. We've outwitted the federales before. Give us the right plan of attack and we can do it again. Any plans to be made will be made by me not by this gringo. I don't know. It might be done at that. It's a long chance, but I want one guarantee. The day Ruiz is finished, I get that mine back. Sole ownership. No strings on it. We don't have to promise you anything. If we win, the mine will be ours anyway. We can have it all for ourselves. I've told you before, we don't need you. You know for a third rate general, you sure make a lot of noise. [Arturo grunts] RaqueL I'm sorry. You too. [door closes] From now on, Irish, I, I guess it's pretty much up to you. [horses trotting] - What about Gallager? - He's still with them. He and Raquel Noriega, they broke out of jail together. More of our men killed. When are you going to stop them? But everything possible is being done-- It is not enough! If they were strong, if they were well armed, there would be an excuse. What are they? Nothing, but a handful of peasants with a few guns. [piano music] I know one way to stop them. Order the commanders in the field to start taking hostages. Every time an Insurrecto fires a gun, one of his family will die. Send that order to all the outposts. Yes, Sir. Sir, a communique from Mexico City. President Diaz. - It's about Orozco's army. - What about it? There's word that he plans to move in on Juarez. You are ordered to send our troops there as reinforcements. Like a crowd of women. They don't feel safe unless they have a 1000 troops around them. Those are the orders, my colonel. What can we do? Obey them. What else? Pass the order along. We march for Juarez. When, my colonel? At the end of the week. That should give us enough time. Confirm the order from Mexico City. Tell them we'll be in Juarez by Sunday. Yes, my colonel. With your permission. [door closes] The orders, what do they mean? Diaz wants you to send troops. There must be trouble. It's a small matter. Why do you let these things worry you? But it sounds urgent. Juarez must be in danger. It's a small matter, I tell you. Diaz is getting old and he's beginning to frighten easily. Let's get out now while we have the chance. Leave and find some place safe. Safe? Why do you worry? It's safe right here. No. I have a feeling about it. All the fighting, killing. Please, let's get away from it. We could be across the border in a day. And leave everything we have? The lands, the cattle, the mines. We own this state, and everything in it. And I have an army to protect it. You're sure there's no danger? Believe me. Love me? With all my heart. [instrumental music] I guess we're not very wise to love now, to have each other. We should have saved it for another time. A different year, different place. It should have happened some other way. Trust me. [music continues] Take me to Colonel Ruiz. I must see Colonel Ruiz. Get down off your horse. I came here to make a bargain with you. It's about time, isn't it, Torres? Not long ago, I offered you a peaceful settlement. No, you wouldn't have it. Now you want to make a bargain. What changed your mind? Is your little group tired of your sterling leadership? I left of my own accord. Would Raquel Noriega have something to do with it? What do you offer? I can tell you the exact location of the lnsurrectos' camp. But I want two things in return. My safety and freedom. The same for Raquel Noriega. [chuckles] I thought so. Alright. Accepted. There is one provision. You lead us to the camp yourself. [imitating bird cawing] [instrumental music] The camp is right over there in that hollow. You stay with him. Now make sure you've got this thing straight. Tomas, we oughta find those oil drums right about here. We'll dump 'em into the basin at the head of the flume right here. Fire it up, and once it gets goin' real good, we'll open up the flood gates and you and I will take off down this way. Now, Carlos, you and your men will be waiting right here. As soon as that fire draws the soldiers off, I want you to move in right through here and hit 'em. That's when you head down this north slope to the shack. L-- I told you where the, uh, gold is stored, didn't I? The strongbox. It should be just below the window. Yeah. And, Tomas, be careful of that oil. Keep it away from the mouth of the tunnel. I don't want any burned out mine on my hands when this thing is over with. It's not gonna be any picnic, just remember that. Make sure of every move you make. If we follow these plans exactly, well, we may connect, who knows? General. There's a patch of trees down at the bottom of that slope. Make a good cover for you. Something bothering you? No. You sound worried. Do me a favor, please? Don't press your luck, hmm? [instrumental music] [gunshots] Federales! [gunshots] Federales! [gunfire] [music continues] We'll stampede the horses and ride out behind them! [gunfire continues] [instrumental music] [horse neighing] [dramatic music] [horse neighing] Tomas: Hey, Irish. Over here. It's Carlos. [instrumental music] Lost a lot of blood. What about the others? They get away? Not many. Save yourself. Get away. Get out now. Tomas... your mother's place. - Can we take him there? Raquel: No. Father Perez, at the church. It'll be safe. - Are you able to ride? - I think so. Give me a hand. [instrumental music] Bring him out. Bring all the prisoners. What is it? They've taken hostages. The families of Insurrectos. They rounded them up this morning. I must go to them. You stay here. Gomez: Get up there! Come on! Get up! It's Concha. Mama. - Mama! - Here, keep this tight. Mamacita! Use your head! Use your head! We wouldn't have a chance. You go out there now and they'll rip you to pieces! - We've got to do something. - Listen to me. We make a move now and it'll be for nothing. They'll line us up against the wall with the rest of 'em! We can't stand here and watch them murdered. There'll be another time, I promise you that. Now use your head. Gomez: Alright! Ready! Fire! [gunfire] [dramatic music] [dramatic music] Hold me, Irish. Hold me tight. Father... any news? None. Except Ruiz considers you finished. His main concern now is Orozco. Any word of Orozco's army? Does he still plan to move on Juarez? I have no word. The executions were not for nothing, my son. Now, every man in the village is ready to fight against Ruiz. It's still the same thing. No guns, no money. Well, there's one out for us. Pick up where we left off. The mine? Gallager: We'll use the same plan. [instrumental music] Oh! [music continues] [instrumental music] [dramatic music] [music continues] [men laughing] [music continues] [fire roaring] The flume! Quickly! Head up there! [indistinct chatter] [water gushing] [indistinct chatter] [dramatic music] [fire roaring] Igunshoq [indistinct chatter] [dramatic music] What's the plan behind it? Why only three bags of gold? They could've taken more. Why only three bags? What does it mean? Don't be a fool! Speak up! The bargain still hold. The bargain will hold. Orozco told them where they could buy guns. Ammunition. That must be why they raided the mine. The gold is to pay for the guns. Where will they buy them? Just across the border. Where? Which point? It must be someplace between Victorio, Arenas. - I don't know. - How many guns? Two hundred. Maybe more. Double the guards at the border. Watch every road! [birds chirping] Load her on. Well, there you are. Two hundred of 'em, right? That was the deal. I'll send four of my men with you as far as the border. Alright, that's fine. Let's move out! [instrumental music] Gallager: Whoa! Okay, this is as far as we go. Good luck, Gallager. Thanks! Giddy up! [music continues] [horses galloping] When were they sighted? Two hours ago. The entire army. Orozco leading them, heading straight for Juarez. Has the alert been sounded? Yes, my colonel. Everything is ready. We'll rendezvous at the mine in Bonita Canyon. - We'll meet Sanchez there. - Yes, Sir. So it depends on us, the whole balance. We reach Orozco in time and he's finished. We fail and we are finished. I think the scale will tip in our favor. Yes, Sir. We can attack just outside of Mendanos. Attack from the rear, we can trap them easily. Gallager: Whoa! Hey, general! - How much further? - An hour. Maybe two hours. You look a little tired. Oh, I'm alright. Water? Thanks. More water? No, I don't think so. You're getting a little mixed up, aren't you? All you want is the gold mine. I just thought of a better combination. You and the gold mine. Hey, what's goin' on up there? Nothing. Not a thing. Let's go. Oh. Let's go. [instrumental music] [music continues] [gunshots] Turn these things around! - Whoa! - No, Irish, don't! Don't, please! If we go after her now, we lose everything. RaqueL You're alright. Beautiful dress. I heard he questioned you. You'd agree to nothing. - Did you expect me to? - You've got to do it. Send word to the Insurrectos. That's all he asks. Tell them to give up the rifles. You'll be set free. Is that why I was brought to you? I talked to Paco. He'll grant you a full pardon if you agree to it. I already told him. Please. You've got to look out for yourself. You can't worry about the Insurrectos. Your place isn't with them. Where is my place? With a man who murdered our mother and father? He didn't do it. It was a mistake. He never ordered them killed. Raquel, please! Take her to the courtyard. It's a beautiful dress. You should have paid money for it. Major Sanchez, troops will meet us at the mine. Good. Move out! Ruiz! Wait a minute, Ruiz! Ruiz, listen to me! Ruiz, you promised! - Ruiz, you promised! - Gomez! Shoot him! Raquefl Igunshoq [dramatic music] [instrumental music] Irish. [dramatic music] [groans] Ruiz, he promised to let Raquel go. He didn't. He's taking her with him. What do you mean? Taking her where? To Juarez. They left the citadel. Whole army's gone to Juarez. He... he took her with him. When did they leave? When did they leave? North. Well, they'll have to go through Bonita Canyon right by the mine. It's the only road north from the Citadel. Takes time to move troops. They can't be too far along. [instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] [dramatic music] [instrumental music] [dramatic music] [music continues] Well, Tomas, if we blow this baby at the right time, Ruiz will never get his troops any farther than right here. Now go on, get out. [instrumental music] [music continues] [instrumental music] [music continues] Halt. Hold your places. [music continues] [dramatic music] [hissing] [music continues] [hissing] Right on time, Colonel. We made our rendezvous with Major Sanchez. Good. Good. [explosion] [horses neighing] [clamoring] [explosion] [gunshots] [intense music] [gunshots continue] Irish! [music continues] [screams] Paco.Paco. Paco! [sobbing] [instrumental music] No. Leave her alone for a while. She'll be alright. Hey, Irish. Look like we fix 'em, huh? Orozco got a free hand now. Nothing to stop him. He'll be in Juarez by mornin'. Why did you do it, Irish? The mine was all you had. It doesn't have to be, general. Know what I mean? [instrumental music]
