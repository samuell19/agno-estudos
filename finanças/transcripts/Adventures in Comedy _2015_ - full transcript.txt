[funky percussive music] ♪ - EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, SOMEBODY WILL SAY, YOU KNOW, "NO OFFENSE, BUT YOU LOOK LIKE JANEANE GAROFALO. NO OFFENSE." I'M LIKE, "UH, WELL, NONE TAKEN." UH, AND THEN, SOMETIMES, THEY'LL SAY, "WHAT EVER HAPPENED-- WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO HER?" WHEN THEY DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S ME, AND THEN I'LL SAY, "IT'S ME." AND THEY'LL SAY, "WHY DID YOU QUIT ACTING?" WHICH IS LIKE GETTING PUNCHED IN THE FACE. - THE REASON I DO STAND-UP IS BECAUSE MY PARENTS DIDN'T REALLY SHOW ME ENOUGH AFFECTION, WHICH I THINK IS WHAT KIND OF COMES DOWN TO WHY MOST PEOPLE DO STAND-UP OR SHOWBIZ IN GENERAL. BUT THE THING IS, LIKE, IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE SHITTY PARENTS IN THE WORLD, YOU WOULDN'T HAVE AN ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY, SO WHEN YOU SEE, LIKE, A--A PARENT ON THE STREET, YOU KNOW, LIKE-- LIKE, YELLING AT THEIR KID OR SAYING THEY'RE A LOSER OR, LIKE, PUNCHING THEM, LIKE, YOU MIGHT SAY THAT THEY'RE A HORRIBLE PERSON, BUT THEY'RE KIND OF KEEPING SHOWBIZ AND THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY ALIVE. I DID STAND-UP FOR ABOUT 11 YEARS, AND I REALLY LIKED IT. I HAD SOME REALLY GOOD SUCCESS AT IT. YOU KNOW, LIKE, I GOT A BUNCH OF, YOU KNOW, TV THINGS, AND I WAS ACTING, AND THINGS WERE GOING WELL, BUT THEN IT JUST KIND OF STOPPED. AND I DIDN'T REALLY LIKE THE DIRECTION MY CAREER WAS GOING, SO I STOPPED, AND I WAS GONNA TRY AND DO SOMETHING ELSE. I WAS GONNA TRY AND GO TO LAW SCHOOL OR SOMETHING, BUT I DON'T KNOW. I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT-- I DIDN'T WANT TO BE A LAWYER. I'M DATING A GIRL, AND WE'RE DOING THIS THING RIGHT NOW. YOU EVER DONE THIS? WE'RE MAKING LISTS OF CELEBRITIES THAT IT'S OKAY FOR US TO HAVE SEX WITH IF THE OPPORTUNITY ARISES. IT'S CLEARLY A VERY HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP. I HAVEN'T FINISHED MY LIST YET, 'CAUSE I'VE BEEN TOO BUSY TRYING TO GET HER SISTER AND HER BEST FRIEND RECORD DEALS. [laughter] THIS IS KIND OF MY LAST SHOT, I THINK, BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH MY LIFE AT THIS POINT. I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT ELSE I CAN DO, YOU KNOW. I'M APPROACHING 40 RAPIDLY, AND MY JOB FOR THE LAST, YOU KNOW, 11 YEARS OR SO WAS BASICALLY BEING A WISE-ASS ONSTAGE. AND, YOU KNOW, ONCE YOU'RE ALMOST 40, YOU KNOW, ONCE YOU HIT 40, YOU CAN'T REALLY GO TO THE HELP-WANTED SECTION AND TRY AND JUST GET A LEGIT JOB. YOU KNOW, LIKE, THERE'S NO CLASSIFIEDS. IT'S LIKE, "HEY, WE'RE LOOKING FOR A SARCASTIC ASSHOLE TO MAKE FUN OF PEOPLE AT THE LAW FIRM," OR, "WE JUST WANT A GUY AT OUR DOCTOR'S OFFICE TO TALK ABOUT HIS BALLS." SO I REALLY NEED THIS CD TO DO SOMETHING. - I ALWAYS LIKEN IT TO BEING, LIKE, A HIGH DIVER, YOU KNOW. THE FIRST THOUSAND TIMES YOU GET UP THERE, YOU'RE WAY--YOU'RE JUST WAY FUCKING UP IN THE SKY, AND IT'S TERRIFYING EVERY TIME YOU GET UP THERE. - ALL COMICS FEEL LIKE THIS IS THE WRONG THING THAT I'M DOING. - OH! - GET HIM OUT OF HERE! - YOU'RE A HUGE ASSHOLE TO WANT TO BE A COMEDIAN IN THE FIRST PLACE. - [making raspy noises] - SO MUCH, LIKE, "FUCK YOU, NO, YOU CAN'T-- "NO, WHO-- WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? YOU'RE NOT FAMOUS ENOUGH. YOU'RE NOT POPULAR ENOUGH." PEOPLE REALLY DON'T WANT YOU TO MAKE IT. - YOU FILTHY CLOWN WHORE! - AH! - I COULD LIKEN IT TO WHEN YOU'RE AT THE CLINIC AND YOU'RE GOING IN TO GET YOUR TEST RESULTS. - I USED TO GET COLD SWEATS. - DURING THE--THE THING? - DURING IT, YOU COULD FEEL YOURSELF SWEATING. - I'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR OVER 20 YEARS. SO THE FIRST SIX YEARS: COMPLETELY TERRIFIED. I WOULD COMPARE STAND-UP TO A TOWN HALL DEALING WITH TEA PARTY ADVOCATES. LIKE, THERE'S A CHANCE FOR IT TO GO CRAZY, BUT YOU PROBABLY SHOULD BE ABLE TO HANDLE IT. RIGHT? - MM-HMM, MM-HMM. YEAH. I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, WE--WE NEED A COMIC, YOU'RE SAYING, FOR THIS GIG? [inhales sharply] YEAH, I CAN'T THINK OF ANYONE. UM, I MEAN, IS TOMMY DAVIDSON AROUND? CAN--DO YOU KNOW HIS PEOPLE? CAN WE GET--I MEAN, I'LL TAKE ANY COMIC AT THIS POINT. UH, LITERALLY ANY COMEDIAN. OH, I LOVE PIZZA. YOU KNOW WHAT I PUT ON MY PIZZA? I'LL TELL YOU EVERY SINGLE TOPPING. SCALLIONS. YOU EVER GET SCALLIONS? THAT'S A WEIRD ONE. ANCHOVIES, I'VE GOTTEN. OF COURSE I'VE GOTTEN EXTRA TOMATO. OKAY. IS THAT IT? ALL RIGHT. GREAT. ALL RIGHT. GREAT, BETH. THANK YOU SO MUCH. OKAY. NO, THANK YOU. NO, THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. I LOVE YOU, BABY. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. I LOVE YOU. [smacking lips] OKAY. - WHO WAS THAT? - THAT WAS MY AUNT. HOW ARE YOU DOING, BUDDY? - I'M GOOD. HOW YOU DOING? - YOU LOOK GOOD. - I DO? THANKS. - YOU LOOK GOOD. LIKE, FOR REAL GOOD. - YEAH. - WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING? YOU GAIN SOME WEIGHT? - UM, NO, I THINK I ACTUALLY LOST SOME WEIGHT. - LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING THAT I THINK YOU'RE GONNA LIKE. - OKAY. - THIS IS A GREAT TIME FOR YOU RIGHT NOW. - IS IT? - YEAH. - WHY? - THIS IS A GREAT TIME. BECAUSE THINGS ARE PRETTY MUCH AS SHITTY AS THEY CAN GET FOR YOU. YOU'RE SO IRRELEVANT. - YEAH. - YOU'RE SO COLD RIGHT NOW THAT YOU'RE HOT. THAT YOU'RE FUCKING HOT, BUDDY. - OKAY. - EVERYTHING SUCKS FOR YOU, WHICH MEANS EVERYTHING'S GREAT. - YEAH. - YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? LIKE, YOU'RE-- YOU'RE PROBABLY HERE, BUT THAT MAKES YOU HERE, YOU KNOW. - RIGHT. RIGHT. - YOU'RE TOTALLY IRRELEVANT. YOU'VE BEEN OUT OF THE GAME FOREVER. - WHICH MEANS I'M... - YOU'RE IN THE GAME. - OKAY. - WHAT DO YOU WANT-- - SO BASICALLY, YOU SAY THE OPPOSITE OF WHATEVER THE FIRST THING. - NO. - NO? - NO, I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING THAT WAS OPPOSITE. - STAND-UP IS LITERALLY THE LOWEST RUNG OF SHOW BUSINESS, AND WE'RE BELOW VENTRILOQUISTS AND MAGICIANS AND A PORN STAR THAT JUST KIND OF WANTS TO TRY IT. YOU'RE BELOW HIM. YOU'RE BELOW STEVE-O. - UH, PEOPLE'S BIGGEST MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT STAND-UP COMEDIANS IS THAT THEY'RE FUNNY-- THEY'RE ACTUALLY FUNNY PEOPLE, AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY NOT. NOT FUNNY AT ALL. - THE--THE BIGGEST MISCONCEPTION THAT PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT STAND-UP COMEDY IS THAT IT'S EASY. - I HAD ONE GOAL, AND THAT WAS TO GET ON THE DAVID LETTERMAN SHOW. I STARTED MARCH 11, 1995, AND I DID LETTERMAN JUNE 13, 2012. FOLLOW YOUR DREAMS. - AND I ACTUALLY WENT BACK TO BEING A LAWYER FOR A WHILE. I WALKED AWAY FROM IT 'CAUSE IT WAS JUST TOO MUCH. BUT I WENT BACK TO LAW, AND I SWORE OFF COMEDY, AND THEN, TWO MONTHS LATER, I WAS BACK AT THE CLUBS DOING COMEDY LIKE AN ALCOHOLIC GOING FOR A DRINK. - CAN'T FUCKING QUIT. - COMEDIANS REALLY DO HAVE TO DO COMEDY. LIKE, WHEN PEOPLE ARE LIKE, "SEINFELD'S GOING BACK TO STAND-UP." LIKE, WELL, OF COURSE HE IS. HE HAS TO DO IT. - LOOK AT ME. LAUGH AT ME. CLAP FOR ME. - RIGHT. - UH, I WANT TO BE SEEN. SO THAT'S A DEGREE OF NARCISSISM, YES? THERE IS THAT THING SAYING, "HEY, DUDE, YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO ANYTHING ELSE." - I'D SAY FROM ABOUT '92 TO ABOUT 2002, I HAD A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES AND A LOT OF SUCCESS, AND THEN IT WENT AWAY, WHICH ACTUALLY FELT MORE NORMAL IN A CERTAIN SENSE, BECAUSE... - WHEN IT WENT AWAY? - WHEN IT WENT AWAY, EVEN THOUGH IT HURT ME TERRIBLY, AND IT STILL, TO THIS DAY, HURTS ME TO THINK ABOUT, "OH, MY GOSH, IT JUST ENDED, "AND I'M NOT AS POPULAR AS I ONCE WAS, WITH, YOU KNOW, CERTAIN PEOPLE." CASTING DIRECTORS OR DIRECTORS. SO THAT HURTS MY FEELINGS, 'CAUSE IT FEELS PERSONAL. IT MAY NOT BE PERSONAL, BUT IT FEELS PERSONAL. BUT THEN, IN ANOTHER SENSE, IT WAS LIKE, "OH, I ALWAYS SUSPECTED NO ONE LIKED ME." - I STOPPED DOING STAND-UP FOR ABOUT 18 MONTHS, AND I GOT BACK INTO IT, BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO. YOU KNOW, LIKE, YOU KNOW, GOING TO JOB INTERVIEWS AND TELLING THEM YOU DID STAND-UP FOR TEN YEARS IS ABOUT AS USEFUL AS A FELONY CONVICTION IN THE REAL WORLD. THE REASON I GOT BACK INTO IT WAS 'CAUSE, UH, THIS GUY, UH, APPROACHED ME ABOUT RECORDING ANOTHER ALBUM. - I FIRST SAW TOM ABOUT EIGHT YEARS AGO AT A SHOW IN THE EAST VILLAGE. HE WAS AMAZING. I MEAN, EASILY THE BEST ON THE SHOW, AND THERE WERE SOME FAMOUS PEOPLE ON THE BILL THAT NIGHT. I MEAN, HE KILLED IT. LITERALLY, HE KILLED. THERE WAS A GIRL WHO HUNG HERSELF DURING THE SHOW. THAT'S HOW FUNNY HE WAS. THIS GUY COULD BE BIG. WITH THE RIGHT BACKING, WITH THE RIGHT MATERIAL, THE RIGHT PROMOTION, THIS GUY COULD BE BIGGER THAN ARSENIO. - OH, TOM MCCAFFREY SHOULD BE WAY MORE FAMOUS THAN HE IS. CLEARLY MORE FAMOUS. - HE'S DEFINITELY ONE OF THE FUNNIEST GUYS IN NEW YORK CITY, AND IF YOU'RE ONE OF THE FUNNIEST GUYS IN NEW--AND THERE'S NOT THAT MANY FUNNY DUDES. THERE'S LITERALLY TEN, AND HE'S ONE OF THEM, AND--AND THE OTHER NINE ARE MILLIONAIRES RIGHT NOW AND ON TELEVISION. - WHEN I WAS TEN YEARS OLD, I APPEARED ON THE OSCARS. IT WAS 1984, JOHNNY CARSON WAS THE HOST, AND I DANCED WITH, LIKE, 50 OTHER KIDS TO THE SONG WHAT A FEELING, WHICH WAS THE SONG FROM THE MOVIE FLASHDANCE BY IRENE CARA. [upbeat music] ♪ I THINK IT WAS THERE THAT I KIND OF GOT HOOKED ON THE IDEA OF BEING IN SHOWBIZ AND BEING FAMOUS OR, I DON'T KNOW, JUST BEING IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY, BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT. AND IT SEEMED REALLY EASY AT THAT POINT, BECAUSE I WAS TEN YEARS OLD AND I WAS ALREADY, YOU KNOW, HANGING OUT WITH, LIKE-- LIKE, JACK NICHOLSON WAS THERE, AND HE CAME UP TO ME AND MADE SOME COMMENT TO ME ABOUT, LIKE, HOW GREAT WE HAD ALL BEEN. AND HE HAD HIS OSCAR IN HIS HAND. SO I WAS JUST KIND OF, LIKE, AROUND ALL THESE OSCAR WINNERS. SO I WAS LIKE, "WOW, THIS IS GONNA BE EASY." - LET'S TALK ABOUT TV SHOWS. - OKAY. COULD YOU GET ME ON SOME TV SHOWS? - WHAT KIND OF TV SHOW DO YOU WANT TO GET ON? - WELL, I WANT TO DO, YOU KNOW, LIKE, A LATE NIGHT TV SHOW, MAYBE. - WHAT KIND OF LATE NIGHT? STEVE HARVEY SHOW? - STEVE HARVEY? - MM-HMM. - I DON'T EVEN THINK HE HAS A SHOW, DOES HE? - HE SHOULD. HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT PITCHING THE STEVE HARVEY SHOW? - [scoffs] WHY WOULD I DO THAT? WHY WOULD I PITCH-- - NAME A SHOW. NAME A SHOW YOU WANT TO BE ON. - OKAY. UH,FALLON. - NO. NAME ANOTHER ONE. - ALL RIGHT.LETTERMAN. - NO, I CAN'T GET YOU EITHER OF THOSE. LET'S MOVE AWAY FROM COMEDY. - OKAY. - I'M THINKING, LIKE, HAVE YOU-- HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT BRAVO? SOMETHING THAT'S MAYBE GAY/LESBIAN FRIENDLY? - CAN YOU JUST--DO YOU-- CAN YOU GET ME ANY GIGS? - I GOT YOU AN AUDITION FOR A JAMBA JUICE COMMERCIAL. - REALLY? - YEAH. IT'S NOT ACTUALLY A COMMERCIAL. YOU'RE--YOU'RE HANDING OUT JAMBA JUICE OUTSIDE OF A MALL. - THAT'S NOT A COMMERCIAL AUDITION AT ALL. - IF YOU WANT TO GET A JOB IN REAL ESTATE RIGHT NOW, I CAN--I CAN HOOK YOU UP. - YEAH. I DON'T WANT TO DO REAL ESTATE. - DO YOU HAVE A REAL ESTATE LICENSE? - NO, I DON'T. I DON'T DO REAL ESTATE. - OKAY. - WHY WOULD I-- - MM, SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE PRETTY PICKY RIGHT NOW FOR WHERE YOU ARE. - I'M TRYING TO GET READY TO RECORD THIS ALBUM. CAN YOU GET ME A GIG DOING STAND-UP TO GET READY FOR THAT? - I'VE ALREADY GOT ONE LINED UP FOR YOU. - WHAT-- - [pounding on keyboard] - WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU EVEN DOING? IS THAT-- - I CAN'T LOG IN. I GOT A SHOW FOR YOU TOMORROW NIGHT... - YEAH. - IN AN APARTMENT... - IN AN APARTMENT. - IN FRONT OF FIVE TO EIGHT PEOPLE. - AND THIS IS, LIKE, A REAL THING? - REAL ARTSY, REAL HIP. - DO I GET PAID FOR THAT? - WELL, I MEAN-- [laughs] LOOK, MAN, YOU WANT TO GET PAID, OR DO YOU WANT TO DO COMEDY? - [scoffs] - PEOPLE DON'T DO BOTH, OKAY? - THEY DON'T? - HANG ON A SECOND. LET ME CRUNCH SOME NUMBERS. - WHAT ARE YOU-- WHAT ARE YOU DOING? YOU'RE JUST-- I DON'T--WHAT IS THAT? YOU'RE-- - 13 COMICS. - YOU JUST-- THAT WASN'T EVEN REAL. - 13 COMEDIANS. WHAT WASN'T REAL? - WHAT--WHAT YOU DID. YOU JUST, LIKE, PRETENDED LIKE YOU WERE HITTING KEYS OR SOMETHING. - I TYPE VERY FAST. LOOK, TOM. - ALL RIGHT, WELL, WHEN IS-- WHEN IS THE GIG? - I'M NOT SURE. I'M NOT POSITIVE. - WELL, WHERE IS IT? - I'M NOT POSITIVE ABOUT THAT EITHER, BUT I CAN TELL YOU SOMETHING. - WHAT? - ONCE I GET THE PASSWORD TO THIS COMPUTER, I WILL HAVE ALL OF THAT INFORMATION FOR YOU, TOM. ALL RIGHT, I GOT TO GO CHANGE THE TONER IN THE COPY MACHINE IN EXCHANGE FOR USING THIS OFFICE. - OKAY. - YOU WANT A JUG OF WATER, BUDDY? THIS IS--THIS IS A JUG OF WATER RIGHT HERE WITH YOUR NAME ON IT. ALL RIGHT. - I DON'T REALLY THINK I CAN-- - HEY. YOU TAKE THAT. GIVE ME 10% OF IT. I'M JUST KIDDING. I'M JUST KIDDING. BUT SERIOUSLY, GIVE ME 10% OF SOMETHING. - OKAY. - HEY, LEAVE THAT JUG OF WATER HERE. YOU REALLY CAN'T HAVE THAT. - IT DID NOT SURPRISE ME AT ALL THAT TOM BECAME A STAND-UP COMIC, BECAUSE HE WAS A NATURAL. THAT WAS THE DIRECTION HE WAS ALWAYS GOING IN. OH, GROWING UP, I MEAN, HE COULD COME IN THE ROOM, AND EVERYONE WOULD JUST START LAUGHING AND CRACKING UP. I MEAN, I REMEMBER, ONE TIME, HE CAME IN, AND HE-- HE JUST TOLD A JOKE, AND EVERYBODY JUST LAUGHED. THAT'S HOW FUNNY HE IS. I REALLY SUPPORT TOM AND HIS DREAMS. I LITERALLY SUPPORT TOM AND HIS DREAMS, STARTING WITH THE CELL PHONE BILL I'VE BEEN PAYING FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS. I LITERALLY SUPPORT HIM AND HIS DREAMS. SO WHAT I'M PRETTY MUCH SAYING IS, IF I WEREN'T HERE, TOM MCCAFFREY WOULDN'T HAVE A PHONE. - I JUST, YOU KNOW, I MEAN, I DO WANT TO BECOME FAMOUS SO THAT, YOU KNOW, LIKE, SCARLETT JOHANSSON WILL BLOW ME. I FEEL LIKE THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND PEOPLE DOING STAND-UP-- AND ME, ESPECIALLY--IS, LIKE, GETTING SCARLETT JOHANSSON OR WHOEVER THE SCARLETT JOHANSSON OF THE DAY IS TO BLOW THEM. - YOU'RE UP 18TH. SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE YOU 18TH. SO THAT'LL... - OKAY. - YEAH. RIGHT. YEAH. - HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ON THE SHOW? - THERE'S 18 PEOPLE ON THE SHOW. YOU'RE GONNA BE 18TH. - SO I'M LAST. - YEAH, WE PUT YOU THERE 'CAUSE YOU'RE THE STRONGEST. THAT'S--THAT'S THE SPOT FOR YOU, 'CAUSE YOU'RE STRONGEST. SO YOU'RE GONNA BE RIGHT AFTER THE VENTRILOQUIST, AND THAT'S RIGHT AFTER THE 20-MINUTE INTERMISSION. - YOU GUYS HAVE A-- - SO STOKED TO HAVE YOU HERE. - RIGHT. RIGHT. - ARE YOU MOUTHING ALONG WITH ME, SANDY? [high-pitched voice] YES, I AM. YOU KNOW, THERE I DIDN'T DO IT. I DIDN'T DO IT THAT TIME, JUST 'CAUSE... [sighs] I DIDN'T DO IT THAT TIME. YOU KNOW WHAT I-- OOH. I--'CAUSE YOU GUYS GET CONFUSED. I KNOW HOW IT IS. YOU'RE-- [high-pitched voice] LET ME SPEAK. LET ME SPEAK. YOU KNOW? SO SOMETIMES WHAT I DO IS I DON'T MOUTH FULLY ALONG WHEN SHE'S TALKING. - ALL RIGHT. THAT WAS GOOD. CANDY AND SANDY. - OH. THANK YOU! THANK YOU! I JUST WANTED TO FINISH UP REAL QUICK. I JUST WANTED TO FINISH UP. THANK YOU, GUYS! - THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD. UH, NOW, UH, COMING TO THE STAGE, VERY FUNNY, TOM MCCAFFREY, EVERYBODY. - WHOO! [light applause] - THERE--YOU GO THROUGH PHASES OR EVEN AFTER BAD SHOWS WHERE YOU'RE JUST LIKE, UGH, YOU KNOW, LIKE, THERE'S LEVELS OF FRUSTRATION OR, YOU KNOW, WONDERING, LIKE, "CAN I DO THIS?" OR, "DO I WANT TO DO THIS?" - YOU GOT TO PAY IN BLOOD AND, LIKE, SWEAT AND TEARS, AND YOU GOT TO LOSE A LOT OF FRIENDSHIPS. PEOPLE LOSE MARRIAGES, PEOPLE-- I'VE SEEN COMICS LOSE THEIR MIND, MAN. I'VE SEEN PEOPLE GO OFF AND NEVER COME BACK. IT'S--THE STAKES GET HIGH. - THIS IS WHAT I REALIZED: I REALIZED THAT ENTERTAINMENT SUCKS. I--I THOUGHT THAT--I THINK IT'S JUST LABELED "ENTERTAINMENT" FOR, YOU KNOW, SHOWBIZ, BUT IT REALLY IS THE BUSINESS. IT--IT'S REALLY MORE THE BUSINESS THAN THE SHOW. THE SHOW IS JUST 10%. THE BUSINESS IS THE PART THAT WE HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO GET. IT'S THAT--IT'S THAT--IT'S THAT CUTTHROAT SHIT THAT'S GOING ON. - I WOULD LOVE-- I WOULD LOVE IT IF I WAS-- IF I WAS ABLE TO GO BACK IN AND HAVE LUCK AGAIN. - RIGHT. - I WOULD--I WOULD BE REALLY HAPPY ABOUT THAT, BECAUSE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT WHEN IT GOES AWAY. IT--IT'S JUST--IT'S JUST HARD, AND LIKE I SAID, IF-- WHEN YOU LOSE ACCESS TO OPPORTUNITY, IT'S--IT'S PAINFUL. I MEAN, HONESTLY, I CAN ONLY-- I CAN ONLY SPEAK FOR ME. I DON'T KNOW HOW OTHER-- - RIGHT. - BUT IT'S VERY PAINFUL TO WATCH PROJECTS GO BY THAT YOU WOULD LOVE TO PARTICIPATE IN, AND IT'S PAINFUL TO WATCH PEOPLE THAT YOU'VE WORKED WITH A BUNCH AND THAT ARE YOUR FRIENDS... - RIGHT. - MOVING ON WITHOUT YOU. - YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T GO--I-- I WAS AWAY FOR ABOUT, YOU KNOW, A LITTLE OVER A YEAR, AND IT'S JUST-- PEOPLE KIND OF FORGET ABOUT YOU REALLY FAST. AND, UH, YEAH, IT KIND OF SUCKS. IT'S KIND OF LIKE STARTING OVER AGAIN, BUT... I GUESS THAT'S WHAT YOU GOT TO DO. I MEAN, YOU CAN TELL, LIKE, WHEN I SEE PEOPLE-- LIKE RELATIVES AND STUFF--NOW, YOU CAN JUST SEE ON THEIR FACE, THEY'RE KIND OF, LIKE-- LIKE, IT'S WEIRD. I'LL TELL THEM I'M A STAND-UP, AND BECAUSE I'M OLDER NOW, THEY ALMOST LOOK AT ME LIKE I JUST TOLD THEM, YOU KNOW, I'M A BREAK-DANCER OR SOMETHING OR, LIKE, A FUCKING PIRATE. I'M HAVING A WEIRD WEEK. I WENT TO GO SEE THE-- THE NEW TYLER PERRY MOVIE IN HARLEM THE OTHER DAY, AND I WAS ACTUALLY THROWN OUT OF THE THEATER FOR NOT TALKING. [laughter] - WHAT'S MY WORST EXPERIENCE I EVER HAD? THE ENTIRE FIRST EIGHT YEARS OF MY DOING COMEDY, I WOULD SAY. - I DID ONE SHOW, WHICH WAS, UM... IT WAS CALLED, UH, NEW JACK COMEDY ON 125TH STREET. THIS IS BEFORE, LIKE, HARLEM-- EVERYONE MOVED UP THERE. ALL AFRICAN-AMERICAN AUDIENCE, AND THE GUY WAS LIKE, UH, THE EMCEE WAS LIKE, "ALL RIGHT, OUR NEXT PERFORMER-- NEXT COMEDIAN--IS A WHITE GUY." "BOO!" AND HE SAID, HE GOES, "AND HE'S A REAL WHITE GUY. THIS GUY IS REALLY WHITE." LIKE, DOUBLE "BOO." - HEY. - HEY, I'M TOM. - THANKS FOR DOING THE SHOW. - NO PROBLEM. - HERE'S YOUR TICKET. - OH, IS THIS, UH, FOR, LIKE, A DRINK OR SOMETHING? - NO, IT GETS YOU, ACTUALLY, A DOLLAR OFF CEREAL IN THE KITCHEN. - OH. YOU GUYS SERVE CEREAL HERE? - HELL YEAH! [laughing] - SO WHAT--THIS IS-- THIS IS YOUR APARTMENT? - THIS IS OUR CLUB, YEAH. - THIS IS YOUR APARTMENT? - OH, YEAH. WE FIGURED, WHAT DO PEOPLE LIKE MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD? COMEDY AND APARTMENTS. AND WE COULDN'T GET PASSES AT ANY OTHER CLUBS, SO-- - HEY, MAN. WHAT'S UP? KING ACE. - WHAT'S YOUR NAME? - KING ACE. - OH, HI. - THANKS FOR DOING THE SHOW. - THAT WAS MY DAD'S NAME. - OH, YEAH, REALLY? OH. - NO, JUST KIDDING. THAT'S NOT. THIS IS--WHERE DOES THE PERFORMANCE HAPPEN? LIKE, IS THIS-- - WELL, THERE'S THE STAGE, YOU KNOW? IT'S LIKE ANY OTHER CLUB. - RIGHT. EXCEPT NOT. - YOU GOT SEATS. YOU GOT MICS. - YEAH. - WE GOT LIGHTS. - NOW, BEING THAT IT'S EAR-- IT'S 4:30... - YEAH. - PEOPLE CAN GET KIND OF ROWDY... - REALLY? - SO DON'T ENCOURAGE IT. - DO PEOPLE COME? - WE USUALLY CANCEL UP TO THREE SHOWS A NIGHT. - RIGHT. - SOMETIMES FOUR ON WEEKENDS. WE HAVE ONE RSVP FOR THIS SHOW. - OKAY. - IT'S GONNA BE THE THREE OF US. WE HAVE AN EMAIL IN TO GAFFIGAN. - JIM GAFFIGAN'S DOING THE SHOW? - NO. - NO, JAKE, JAKE GAFFIGAN. HE WORKS AT THE DUANE READE RIGHT DOWN THE STAIRS. - I GET CEREAL IN THE KITCHEN OR SOMETHING? - YEAH, DIDN'T I-- I GIVE YOU YOUR TICKET? - YEAH, YEAH, YOU DID. - YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE TICKET TO GET IT. - YEAH, YEAH. - THIS IS A BRINGER SHOW. - OH, IT IS? - YEAH, BRING YOUR OWN SPOON. - [chuckles] - RIGHT, RIGHT, FOR THE CEREAL? - DON'T STEAL THAT, YOU KNOW? - I WILL NOT STEAL THAT. - GUYS, WE SHOULD REALLY TRY TO START TO GET READY, I THINK. - FOR THE SHOW? - YEAH. - BUT NO ONE'S HERE. - NO, WELL, THE GREEN ROOM WILL BE READY IN, LIKE, FIVE MINUTES, AS SOON AS MY UNCLE GETS OUT OF THE SHOWER. - OH, OKAY. YOUR--YOUR UNCLE'S IN THE SHOWER? - GUYS, WE SHOULD-- - WELL, HE'S IN THE GREEN ROOM. - WHAT? HE'S IN THE GREEN ROOM? ALL RIGHT, I'M NOT GONNA-- I THINK I'M GONNA GO GET SOME CEREAL. SO CAN I HAVE A CEREAL? - NO. - AND THE HARDEST THING ABOUT BEING 400 POUNDS IS, YOU'RE NEVER NOT AT WENDY'S. THANK YOU, THAT WAS A FACEBOOK STATUS BY RALPHIE MAY. - YEAH, I USED TO DATE THIS GIRL. SHE COULD HAVE BEEN A MODEL. YEAH, SHE WAS THAT STUPID. SO, YOU GUYS, THIS HAPPENED TO ME THE OTHER DAY. YOU EVER GET SO DRUNK THAT YOU CAN'T FIND YOUR CAR? - YEAH. - YEAH, REALLY? SEE, THIS GIRL KNOWS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. - AND THAT'S WHY, WHEN IT'S COLD ENOUGH OUTSIDE, EVERY JACKET IS A LIFE JACKET. THANKS, EVERYBODY. PICK UP MY NEW ALBUM "ACE HOLE." COMES OUT, I THINK, IN A YEAR. - HEY, HEY, ALL RIGHT. HEY, NOW. - HI. NICE TO MEET YOU. GREAT SHOW. - OH, THANK YOU. - I'M THINKING OF DOING STAND-UP TOO. - GOOD LUCK. KEEP WRITING. HAVE YOU BEEN WRITING? I WROTE FOR THREE YEARS BEFORE I EVEN GOT ONSTAGE. YOU--I MEAN, YOU COULD TAKE AN IMPROV CLASS, BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S GONNA GET YOU ANYWHERE. - YOU GOT ANY GOOD GIGS COMING UP? - YEAH, I'M OPENING FOR MIKE TILLY AT CHUCKLE FARTS. - WHO'S MIKE TILLY AGAIN? - THE TILL MAN? HE ROCKS THIS CLUB. - OH. - IT'S IN THE BACK OF A TACO BELL ON STATEN ISLAND. - YEAH. - HAS HE EVER BEEN ON TV? - HE DID A SPOT ON CARSON DALY IN '96. CRUSHED. - OH, NOW I REMEMBER HIM. - PAYS THREE CHALUPAS AND UNLIMITED HOT SAUCE. YOU WANT TO COME? - YEAH, HOW'D YOU GET THAT GIG? - I RESPONDED TO SOME SCRATCHITI ON THE INSIDE OF A PORTA-POTTY. - AH. I GOT TO RESPOND TO MORE SCRATCHITI. - WHAT IS SCRATCHITI? - IT'S GRAFFITI WITH KEYS. - HEY, I GOT SOME GOOD GIGS COMING UP. I'M DOING THE COMEDY DUMP NEXT TUESDAY. 4:00 P.M. SHOW, DOING A TIGHT THREE. GOT TO BRING SIX PEOPLE, DRINK EIGHT DRINKS, NO PETS, NO CHAIRS. - THAT'S AWESOME. WHAT BITS ARE YOU GONNA DO? - I WAS THINKING ABOUT OPENING WITH SPONGEBOB SQUAREBALLS. - YOU JUST DID MY JOKE UP THERE I JUST DID, LIKE, FIVE MINUTES BEFORE YOU. - WHAT JOKE? - WHAT DO YOU MEAN, WHAT JOKE? YOU DON'T REMEMBER WHAT JOKE? - NO, I DIDN'T EVEN SEE YOUR SET. - I DO A JOKE ABOUT MASTURBATING, AND THEN YOU DO A JOKE ABOUT MASTURBATING? MINE IS ABOUT MASTURBATING IN THE BATHTUB, AND YOU DON'T THINK IT'S WEIRD THAT THEN YOU GO UP, LIKE, FIVE MINUTES LATER AND DO A JOKE ABOUT MASTURBATING IN THE SHOWER? - LOOK, DUDE, I'VE NEVER EVEN SEEN YOU DO STAND-UP. - NO, THAT'S BULLSHIT. THAT'S RIDICULOUS. THE ODDS OF THIS HAPPENING ARE, LIKE, ONE IN A BILLION. - JERKING OFF IS A UNIVERSAL TOPIC, IDIOT. - BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER, BECAUSE HOW COULD YOU HAVE THOUGHT OF IT? YOU WERE STANDING THERE. - WELL, HOW DOES YOUR JOKE GO? - MY JOKE? - YEAH. KNOCK, KNOCK? - NO, IT'S NOT KNOCK, KNOCK. IT'S COCK-COCK IN YOUR MOTHER'S TUSHY. WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER JOKE THAT YOU DO ABOUT PORN WHICH IS EXACTLY LIKE MY REALLY GOOD FRIEND'S JOKE? - WHO--WHO'S YOUR FRIEND? WHAT'S HIS NAME? - WHO'S MY FRIEND? DON'T ACT LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW WHO MY FRIEND IS. TURKEY BALLS-- HE WAS ON FIRST IN THE SHOW. HE DID THE SAME JOKE, AND THEN YOU GO ON-- - WHY WOULD I STEAL A JOKE FROM A GUY NAMED TURKEY BALLS? - WHO CARES? JUST GO HOME. NO, I DIDN'T STOP YOU. - WHY DON'T YOU GO HOME? - I'M GOING TO HEADLINE A SHOW AT A LAUNDROMAT, ALL RIGHT, LOSER? - I STARTED A NEW TWITTER ACCOUNT UNDER AN ALIAS. - OH, WHAT IS IT? - I HAVE 80 FOLLOWERS RIGHT NOW, AND I HAVE 20 MORE, I'M GONNA MOVE TO L.A. AND WRITE A BOOK. - WHAT'S--WHAT'S THE BOOK GONNA BE? -MOM DUMPS. IT'S A COFFEE TABLE BOOK. PICTURES OF MOMS TAKING DUMPS. - SAW A COMMERCIAL FOR THIS PILL TO TREAT PMS. AND AT THE END OF THE COMMERCIAL, THEY'RE LIKE, "SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE STOMACH PAINS, NAUSEA, AND IRRITABILITY." [laughter] I WAS LIKE, THAT JUST SOUNDS LIKE PMS AGAIN. LIKE, YOU CAN'T DO THAT. YOU CAN'T COME OUT WITH A PILL TO TREAT SOMETHING, AND THEN THE SIDE EFFECTS ARE JUST THE EXACT THING AGAIN. RIGHT, THAT'S LIKE IF THEY CAME OUT WITH A PILL TO TREAT HERPES, AND IT WAS LIKE, SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE SUPER HERPES. [laughter] - SOME OF THEM ARE PAID, BUT, YOU KNOW, LIKE, YOU'LL DO A SHOW, AND THEY'LL PAY, LIKE, $35. AND, I MEAN, FINE, BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T LIVE ON $35. - A LOT OF THE CLUBS WOULD KIND OF COME AT YOU WITH THIS ATTITUDE THAT THE CLUBS ARE YOUR COLLEGE, THIS IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO BE SEEN AND HONE YOUR CRAFT. AND IT'S LIKE, WELL, SOMEONE'S MAKING A LOT OF MONEY WHILE WE GO TO COLLEGE. AND HOW MANY YEARS ARE WE GONNA BE IN COLLEGE FOR? I'VE DONE THREE OR FOUR LETTERMAN SETS. WHEN DO I GRADUATE? - YEAH, YEAH. - YOU KNOW, SO IT'S LIKE, NOT EVERYONE'S GONNA WIN THE LOTTERY TICKET OF THE SEINFELD, YOU KNOW, PATH OR RAY ROMANO. AND THAT'S GREAT, YOU KNOW, BUT THAT'S NOT REALISTIC FOR EVERYONE. - TOM WAS OUR NANNY FOR YEARS WHEN WE HAD OUR TWO DAUGHTERS. SO EVEN THOUGH OUR CHILDREN ARE BOTH GETTING READY TO GO TO COLLEGE OR IN COLLEGE, WE'VE PRETTY MUCH KEPT TOM AS OUR NANNY, BECAUSE-- BECAUSE WE HAVE TO. HE NEEDS US TO. AND HE WOULD LOVE FOR US TO HAVE ANOTHER BABY. HE'S ACTUALLY BEEN ENCOURAGING IT SO THAT HE CAN REMAIN OUR NANNY. I CAUGHT-- THE LAST TIME I SAW HIM, I CAUGHT HIM POKING HOLES IN MY HUSBAND'S CONDOMS. - I'M BACK. - OH, YEAH. - HE'S BACK. - WHOO! YEAH! COMEDY, BABY. - I REMEMBER-- I REMEMBER ONE TIME I WAS AUDITIONING FOR A CLUB-- I'M NOT GONNA MENTION THE CLUB 'CAUSE I DON'T WANT TO EMBARRASS THEM-- BUT I WAS AUDITIONING FOR A CLUB IN NEW YORK, AND I DID, LIKE, A FIVE-MINUTE SET, AND I DID REALLY GOOD. IT WAS A GOOD SET, I THOUGHT. AND, YOU KNOW, LIKE, CROWD-WISE, IT TURN--IT WAS A GOOD-- GOOD REACTION. AND AFTER IT, THEY JUST SAID, "AH, MAN, YOU'RE TOO GREEN. I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T LIKE IT." AND SIX MONTHS LATER, I AUDITIONED AGAIN, AND I HAD A LITTLE BIT MORE HEAT ON ME, AND I DID THE EXACT SAME SET TO AUDITION WITH, AND THEY WERE LIKE, "THAT WAS AMAZING." CLEARLY THE GUY WAS NOTORIOUS FOR NOT EVEN WATCHING PEOPLE THAT HE DIDN'T WANT TO PASS. SO IT WAS, LIKE, A KIND OF A THING WHERE-- IT WAS A LESSON IN EITHER THEY WANT YOU OR THEY DON'T A LOT OF TIMES. THEY'RE NOT REALLY PAYING ATTENTION AND REALLY SEEING WHAT THEY CAN GET OUT OF SOMEONE. THEY JUST WANT TO FOLLOW SOMEBODY THAT'S GOT HEAT. - THIS IS A GREAT TIME. THERE'S HEAT. - THERE'S HEAT? - THERE'S BUZZ. YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES A DAY I PICK UP THIS PHONE, AND IT'S LIKE, "TOM MCCAFFREY, TOM MCCAFFREY"? NONE. HERE'S WHAT-- - I MEAN, DO YOU KNOW ANYONE IN, LIKE, THE BUSINESS? - DO YOU KNOW THE MONTREAL COMEDY FESTIVAL? - YEAH. - HOW ABOUT THE ONTARIO IMPROV FESTIVAL? - NO, WHAT-- I'VE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF THAT. - WELL, EVERYONE WILL SOON. ONCE YOU DO IT. - EVERYONE'S GONNA KNOW ABOUT IT WHEN I DO IT? I DON'T EVEN DO IMPROV. - YOU DON'T? - NO. I DO STAND-UP. - NAME A COLOR. NAME A COLOR. - BLUE. - YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU DON'T--YOU DON'T DO IMPROV. - MONTREAL, YEAH, LIKE, 20 YEARS AGO WAS, LIKE, THE ONLY COMEDY FESTIVAL, AND THAT WAS THE ONLY CHANCE THAT INDUSTRY HAD TO SEE YOU IF YOU WERE A NOBODY. - OH, I JUST GOT IN THE MONTREAL JUST FOR LAUGHS COMEDY FESTIVAL. PRAISE THE LORD. - GET TO THE MONTREAL COMEDY FESTIVAL, GET SEEN AT THE MONTREAL COMEDY FESTIVAL, AND THE MONEY WAS FLOWING LIKE WATER FOR STAND-UPS. AND I THINK THAT WAS DUE TO THE FACT OF SUCCESS OF TIM ALLEN AND BRETT BUTLER AND ALL THOSE PEOPLE. EVERYBODY KNOWS THE CHANGE. I MEAN, IT'S HAPPENED WITH THE CHICKEN. THERE WAS SOME GUY NAMED THE CHICKEN AT MONTREAL COMEDY FESTIVAL, HIS BIG THING WAS FUCKING THE STOOL TO THE WILLIAM TELL OVERTURE. AND--AND HE GOT, LIKE, $1/2 MILLION. OH, HE KILLED HIMSELF, LIKE, A COUPLE YEARS AGO. - OH, HE DID? - YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. SO IT WAS-- - DID HE JUST NOT GO ANY-- - HE DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE. - LISTEN, I GOT TO GO DO A THING. I GOT TO TALK TO TOOTIE FROM FACTS OF LIFE. - TOOTIE? - IT WAS A BIG NIGHT FOR HER. - WAIT, WHY? IS SHE GETTING BACK INTO ACTING? - OH, NO, NO, NO, SHE'S HEADLINING CAROLINES TONIGHT. - SHE DOES STAND-UP? - OH, SHE DOESN'T DO STAND-UP, MAN. SHE DOES THIS 40-MINUTE STORY ABOUT HOW NATALIE ONCE PUSSY FARTED ON THE SET OF FACTS OF LIFE. BLOW YOU AWAY. - THAT'S A-- - BLOW YOU AWAY. - THAT STORY TAKES 40 MINUTES TO TELL? - I MEAN, THERE'S A LOT OF BUILDUP. - LIKE, WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS SHE SAYS IN THE STORY? - SHE TALKS ABOUT WHAT NATALIE ATE THAT DAY. SHE DID YOGA EARLIER IN THE DAY. YOU CAN'T OPEN FOR HER. THIS GUY TURKEY BALLS IS OPENING FOR HER. - WHO'S TURKEY BALLS? - YOU DON'T KNOW TURKEY BALLS? - NO. - TURKEY BALLS IS INSANE. HE TELLS THESE REALLY HEADY JOKES ABOUT HOW HIS BALLS LOOK LIKE TURKEYS. IT'LL BLOW YOU AWAY. - IF YOU HAD TO COMPARE HIS STYLE TO ANOTHER COMEDIAN-- - SEINFELD. - OKAY, HE'S LIKE SEINFELD? - HE'S KIND OF LIKE SEINFELD IF SEINFELD HAD BALLS THAT LOOKED LIKE TURKEYS. YOU KNOW, SEINFELD IS PROLIFIC. TURKEY BALLS IS PROLIFIC. THEY'RE BOTH VERY SMART. - BUT WHAT DOES HE-- YOU JUST SAID ALL HE DOES IS TELL JOKES ABOUT HOW HIS BALLS LOOK LIKE TURKEYS. - YEAH. - HOW IS THAT PROLIFIC? - IF YOU HAD BALLS THAT LOOKED LIKE TURKEYS, YOU WOULDN'T JOKE ABOUT THAT? WHAT WOULD YOU BE DOING? WHAT WOULD YOU JOKE ABOUT-- - I DON'T THINK I'D WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT. I WOULD KIND OF JUST KEEP THAT TO MYSELF. - YEAH, WE'RE DEVELOPING A SHOW ABOUT HIM, ACTUALLY. IT'S CALLED TURKEY BALLS, AND IT'S ABOUT HIS BALLS-- - WELL, WHAT HAPPENS IN THE-- - I DON'T KNOW. I'M NOT THE WRITER. - WELL, CAN I BE ON IT? - YOU CAN'T BE ON IT, ALL RIGHT? IT WAS JUST BOOKED UP. I TRIED TO GET YOU ON. THEY TOOK THE GUY WHO SHOT REAGAN INSTEAD. - I DON'T--HOW IS THAT GUY GONNA BE ON A SHOW? - THEY'RE SETTING UP A GREEN SCREEN BEHIND HIM. HE'S HUGE NOW, MAN. - IS HE GOOD AT ACTING? - EVERYONE'S CALLING ME ABOUT HIM. - IS HE A REALLY GOOD ACTOR? - NO, HE'S A TERRIBLE ACTOR, BUT HE'S GREAT. - WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO YOUR MATERIAL AND YOUR STAND-UP AND... IT'S NOT TO SAY THAT, YOU KNOW, AGENTS AND MANAGERS ARE NOT IMPORTANT. BUT IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO THE CONTENT, RIGHT? - OH, HEY. - HOW'S IT GOING? - GOOD, MAN. SO YOU'RE TIM MCELROY? - NO, NO, I'M TOM MCCAFFREY. - OH, RIGHT, RIGHT. SO FIRST OFF, JIM, WHAT KILLED YOUR SET FOR ME RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE... - YEAH. - WAS, YOU THANKED THE HOST. YOU NEVER THANK THE HOST. THAT'S COMEDY RULE NUMBER ONE. - WHY NOT? - I MEAN, IT'S A COMEDY SHOW, NOT A "THANK THE HOST" SHOW. I MEAN, YOU'RE NOT HOSTING THE OSCARS. - RIGHT. DOES THE HOST OF THE OSCARS THANK PEOPLE A LOT? - YEAH, IT'S THE OSCARS. HE THANKS PEOPLE ALL NIGHT. I THOUGHT IT WAS GENERALLY THE WINNERS OF THE OSCARS THAT THANKED THE PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, LIKE, THEIR AGENTS. I THOUGHT THE HOST-- - NO, NO, NO, IT'S THE HOST. - WELL, HE--WHY WOULD HE THANK PEOPLE, THOUGH? - 'CAUSE HE'S HOSTING THE OSCARS. YOU GOT HUGE LAUGHS, YOU KNOW, AND YOU DID GREAT, AND PEOPLE LOVED YOUR JOKES. BUT I HAVE TO BE VERY HONEST WITH YOU. I DON'T PERSONALLY SEE ANYTHING ABOUT YOU THAT WOULD IN ANY WAY BE INTERESTING TO ANYONE IN THE WORLD. - RIGHT. - I MEAN, NO OFFENSE. - NO OFFENSE? OH, YEAH, WHY WOULD I BE OFFENDED? - I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD. STAND-UP'S NOT ABOUT TELLING JOKES, OKAY? IT'S ABOUT MAKING PEOPLE LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND SEE THEMSELVES AND THINK, WHO AM I? THAT'S WHAT STAND-UP IS ABOUT. - THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT? - YEAH, I MEAN-- - IT'S NOT ABOUT TELLING JOKES TO PEOPLE? - NO, NO. I MEAN, MY DOG CAN DO THAT. I-- - YOUR DOG CAN DO STAND-UP? - YOU KNOW, THE THING ABOUT YOU IS THAT YOU'RE-- WELL, YOU'RE A WHITE GUY. - YEAH. - AND PRETTY MUCH ACROSS THE BOARD, NO WHITE GUYS EVER REALLY MAKE IT IN COMEDY. - THEY DON'T? - NO. - WELL, WHAT ABOUT, LIKE, ADAM SANDLER? HE MADE IT. - ADAM SANDLER? FIRST OF ALL, ADAM SANDLER IS NOT THAT SUCCESSFUL. - WELL, WHAT ABOUT, LIKE-- NOT TO BE BELABOR THIS, BUT, LIKE, GEORGE CARLIN? HE WAS A WHITE GUY. HE... - GEORGE CARLIN? - YEAH. - GEORGE CARLIN IS DEAD. I MEAN, IS THAT OUR DEFINITION OF SUCCESS? - I KNOW, I WAS REFERRING TO MORE WHEN HE WAS, LIKE, ALIVE. - GEORGE CARLIN WAS NOT A VERY SUCCESSFUL COMEDIAN. - SO WHO-- JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY, WHO WOULD YOU CONSIDER TO BE A SUCCESSFUL COMEDIAN? - UH, YOU KNOW, I MEAN, MR. MAGOO, THAT CARTOON CHARACTER, WAS GREAT. - WELL, YOU KNOW, HE IS A WHITE GUY. - WHITE CARTOON. - THINKING THIS GUY IS A PROFESSIONAL, RIGHT? LIKE, HE MUST KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT. THEN AFTER A WHILE, LIKE, HE WAS VERY CONTROLLING. AND I WAS LIKE-- IT TOOK THE FUN OUT OF IT. - YOU NEED TO BE VULNERABLE AND OPEN AND HONEST AND RAW AND WITTY AND NOT WHITE AND YOUNGER AND TRAGIC AND HAPPY AND SAD, ALL AT ONCE. - LIKE, WHO CAN DO THAT, DO YOU THINK? WHAT COMEDIANS? - ADAM SANDLER IS GREAT AT THAT. GEORGE CARLIN WAS EXCELLENT AT IT. I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT HERE. I DID STAND-UP FOR A WHILE. - HOW LONG DID YOU DO STAND-UP FOR? - LIKE, THREE WEEKS. - WHERE DID YOU GET UP? - UH, MY FRIEND'S HOUSE MOSTLY. - OH, YOUR FRIEND HAD, LIKE, A COMEDY CLUB IN HIS HOUSE? - NO, HE JUST HAD A HOUSE-- WHO WOULD HAVE A COMEDY CLUB IN THEIR-- MY FRIEND HAD A HOUSE. I WOULD PERFORM AT MY FRIEND'S HOUSE. LIKE, WE'D RENT MOVIES, AND I WOULD SAY FUNNY THINGS AFTER THE MOVIES. - OH. - DURING THE MOVIES. MY POINT IS THAT BEING FUNNY JUST ISN'T ENOUGH ANYMORE. I MEAN, THIS ISN'T THE '80s. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE GONNA NEED A HOOK. - CRITICISM HURTS ME TERRIBLY. I DON'T HAVE A THICK SKIN ABOUT IT. IT DOESN'T ROLL RIGHT OFF MY BACK. YOU KNOW, I WOULD PREFER TO BE WELL-LIKED. - THAT DRINK IS NOT FREE. - OH, REALLY? THEY TOLD ME I GOT A FREE DRINK. - NO. - I DON'T? - IT'S $12. - IT'S $12? - YEAH. - OKAY, I GUESS-- - SO... - OH, I HAVE TO GIVE YOU THE $12? - YEAH. - YOU KNOW, THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY IS A LOT OF "COME HERE, COME HERE. COME HERE, COME HERE, COME HERE." - PEOPLE ONLY LOOK AT THE NEGATIVE COMMENTS BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT AGREE WITH YOU ON THE INSIDE. LIKE, THAT'S HOW I FEEL ABOUT ME TOO, THAT I'M WORTHLESS, I'M SHITTY. SO WHEN THOSE PEOPLE SAY I'M WORTHLESS, I'LL BE LIKE, YEAH. PEOPLE ARE LIKE, NO, YOU'RE GREAT, YOU'RE AMAZING, YOU'RE LIKE, NAH, YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, BUT THAT GUY KNOWS. - I GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU, BUDDY. - WHAT IS IT? - I HAVE AN UNCONFIRMED MEETING WITH A MUSIC TELEVISION STATION. I DON'T WANT TO SAY WHICH ONE. [coughs] VH1. - YEAH? - 'CAUSE THEY'RE LOOKING FOR PITCHES FOR SPIN-OFF SHOWS RIGHT NOW... - REALLY? - OF THEIR CURRENT SHOWS. - OKAY. - GUESS WHO THE EXECUTIVE IS. - I HAVE NO IDEA. WHO IS IT? - THE SON OF TOOTIE FROM FACTS OF LIFE. - THE SON OF TOOTIE IS THE EXECUTIVE? - HE'S THE EXECUTIVE THERE. - WHAT'S HIS NAME? - I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO MEET WITH HIM OR GET HIS AUTOGRAPH... - RIGHT, RIGHT. - BECAUSE THAT'S EXCITING. - WHY WOULD I WANT HIS AUTOGRAPH? - 'CAUSE HE'S THE SON OF TOOTIE. - WHAT'S HIS NAME? - HIS NAME IS ALSO TOOTIE. - SO SHE NAMED HIM AFTER THE CHARACTER? - NO, SHE NAMED HER KID AFTER HER GREAT-GRANDFATHER, WHO ALSO WAS NAMED TOOTIE. IT WAS SPELLED DIFFERENTLY, THOUGH. IT WAS THE NUMBER 2 AN THEN THE LETTER T. - WHAT IS THIS MEETING GONNA DO FOR ME? - I MEAN, THEY'RE PRODUCING CONTENT LIKE IT'S NOBODY'S BUSINESS. THE NEXT PROJECT THAT THEY'RE WORKING ON IS ACTUALLY STARRING TOOTIE, BEING PRODUCED BY MENUDO, AND IT'S CALLED TOOTIE CLEANS TOILETS. TOOTIE'S GONNA GO INTO SEVERAL HOMES, START CLEANING TOILETS. - IT'S BEING PRODUCED BY MENUDO? - MENUDO. - THE GROUP? - THE GROUP MENUDO. I WAS LIKE, WHY HAS THIS NOT HAPPENED SOONER? - WHY WOULD MENUDO WANT TO BE INVOLVED IN A SHOW ABOUT CLEANING PUBLIC TOILETS? - [laughs] WHY WOULDN'T THEY? IT'S HOT RIGHT NOW, MAN. - WHICH TOOTIE IS IN IT? THE SON OR THE MOM? - BOTH. BOTH TOOTIES ARE GONNA BE IN IT. - WHAT'S THE NAME OF THE SHOW? - IT'S CALLED TOOTIE CLEANS TOILETS, AND I WAS LIKE, "PERFECT NAME." - THERE WAS AGAIN THE TYPE OF ACCESS THAT I USED TO HAVE TO CERTAIN THINGS, AND I-- IT SEEMS ALMOST INCONCEIVABLE TO AUDITION FOR A STUDIO FILM NOW. LIKE, IT'S-- I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE IT HAPPENING ANYMORE OR TO EVEN GET AN OFFER. USED TO BE, DURING THE LUCKY PERIOD, IT WAS JUST OFFER ONLY. IT'S GONE BACK NOW TO... EVEN A LEVEL BELOW, "SHE'S GOT TO AUDITION," BECAUSE IT'S A "NO, I DON'T WANT TO SEE HER." HOW MANY MOVIES CAN-- AND I LOVE PAUL RUDD, BELIEVE ME. I AM A HUGE PAUL RUDD FAN AND HAVE BEEN FOR YEARS. HOW MANY MOVIES CAN YOU DO? - RIGHT, RIGHT. - HOW MANY TIMES CAN I SEE THE SAME GROUP OF FUNNY GUYS IN A GROUP? THE PROBLEM I HAVE IS THAT-- IS NOT THEIR FAULT. IT'S THE CASTING DIRECTORS AND DIRECTORS AND PRODUCERS ABOVE THEM WHO REFUSE TO ALLOW THE POSSIBILITY. AND I'M NOT EVEN TRYING TO BE A MAIN PERSON IN A MOVIE. I'M TELLING YOU, I'M TALKING ABOUT NUMBER 14 ON THE CALL SHEET. IF YOU'RE--FOR THEM TO CALL-- - RIGHT, RIGHT. - I DON'T EVEN CARE IF IT'S THE ROLE OF THE PIZZA DELIVERY PERSON. - YOU'RE SORT OF PERFECT FOR THIS SHOW. - OH, REALLY? - YEAH, YOU'RE, LIKE, PERFECT FOR IT. - OH, WOW. GREAT, GREAT, SO... - I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY SAY, YOU KNOW, IN THE LAST WORD... - OH, YOU DON'T HAVE ANY SAY? - BUT I DON'T-- BUT I'LL DEFINITELY BE PUSHING YOU HARD FOR THIS. - OH, OKAY. HOW DOES IT WORK? SHOULD I FOLLOW UP OR-- - YEAH, I, LIKE-- I SHOW THEM ALL THE TAPES, SO DEFINITELY FOLLOW UP. - OH, LIKE, 'CAUSE YOU TAPED THE SHOW? - WELL, OKAY, SO... - YEAH. - THE CAMERA BATTERY, WHEN YOU GOT ONSTAGE, KIND OF WENT OUT, SO I DIDN'T REALLY GET TO TAPE YOU, BUT... - OH, OKAY. THE CAMERA BATTERY DIED? - YEAH, I DIDN'T PUT THE CAMERA IN MY BAG BECAUSE I WAS FIDDLING WITH MY... WELL, MY CAT'S DYING. - SO YOU DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE CAMERA? - SO I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE CAMERA. - OH, SO IT WASN'T CHARGED... - SO WASN'T ABLE TO TAPE YOU. - AND IT'S NOT HERE. YEAH, SO YOU-- - ANYWAY... - BUT HOW-- SO HOW WILL THEY KNOW-- - SO I CAUGHT-- YOU KNOW, THE LAST BIT I SAW WAS-- YOU NAILED THAT SHIT HARD. - THE LAST BIT OF MY SET? - THE LAST BIT I SAW. - HOW MUCH--YOU DIDN'T SEE IT? - YEAH, I SAW, LIKE, THE LAST TEN SECONDS, AND YOU WERE AMA-- YOU NAILED IT. - RIGHT. - YOU NAILED IT. YOU'RE SOLID. - THE LAST TEN SECONDS? - YOU'RE SO SOLID. YEAH, THE LAST TEN SECONDS WHEN YOU WERE LIKE... - WHAT DID YOU LIKE ABOUT WHAT I DID? - "HEY, I'M TOM MCCAFFREY. THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING OUT." - YEAH. - LIKE, YOU'RE SO-- IT'S NOT PUSHY. AND YOU DIDN'T FALL, WHICH IS A PLUS, WHEN YOU LEFT THE STAGE, SO I'M DEFINITELY GONNA MENTION-- - YEAH, I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THAT. YOU'RE GONNA MENTION THAT I DIDN'T FALL? - I'M GONNA MENTION THAT I-- I DIDN'T SEE YOUR SET, BUT I DID SEE THE LAST SECOND WHERE YOU DID NOT FALL. - SO THIS WOULD BE A SHOW THAT WOULD BE A LOT LOWER BUDGET, A LOT SIMPLER, WOULDN'T COST YOU GUYS A LOT OF MONEY. BE, LIKE, A FUNNY SHOW ABOUT POP CULTURE AND, LIKE, PEOPLE AND POP CULTURE AND TALKING ABOUT HOW STUPID THEY ARE. - YEAH, THEY'RE STUPID. - 'CAUSE YOU KNOW HOW, LIKE, CELEBRITIES CAN BE DUMB AND STUFF? - [laughing] YES, YES, YES. - OR, LIKE, OH, LIKE, YOU KNOW, AMANDA BYNES FARTED, YOU KNOW? - [laughs] - OR YOU KNOW HOW, LIKE, SEAN-- - SHE FARTED! - YEAH, YOU KNOW HOW SEAN CONNERY'S, LIKE, GETTING OLD? - OH, MY GOD, YES. - YOU KNOW HOW CELEBRITIES GET OLD? - YES. - IT'S LIKE, LOOK AT THEM. WHY ARE YOU GETTING SO OLD? THAT'S STUPID. - I LOVE THAT, BECAUSE LOOK AT HOW-- LIKE, HOW KIM KARDASHIAN'S FAT NOW. - YEAH, SHE'S FATTER. - YEAH, OR LOOK, LIKE, HOW LINDSAY LOHAN LOOKS LIKE SHIT. - HONESTLY-- I'M GONNA BE HONEST WITH YOU. - OKAY, GREAT. - SORRY. I THINK YOU'RE TOO OLD FOR THIS SHOW. - HOW OLD IS THE AGE RANGE? - LIKE, YOU KNOW, 20-YEAR-OLDS THAT LOOK LIKE THEY'RE 14. YOU KNOW? - OKAY, YEAH. - OR 14-YEAR-OLDS-- NO. - 14-YEAR-OLDS THAT LOOK LIKE THEY'RE 9? - YEAH. [laughs] - RIGHT? - THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SO FUNNY. - [laughing] - YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, TOTALLY. SO YOU MIGHT BE INTO THAT, RIGHT? - UH, YEAH. WHO ARE WE GONNA GET TO HOST? - WELL, I WOULD HOST IT. I WOULD BE THE HOST. - OH. [imitates brakes squealing, crash] ON THE BRAKES THERE. HERE'S WHAT MY THINKING IS-- THAT WE GET SOMEONE ELSE TO HOST. YOU KNOW, JUST SOMEONE THAT'S NOT YOU. IF YOU CAN GET DANIEL TOSH, THAT'D BE GREAT. EVEN BETTER IS IF YOU GOT ADRIEN BRODY. HE'S AMAZING. - RIGHT. - AND I'M THINKING THAT THIS SHOW IDEA WORKS BEST WHEN IT'S, YOU KNOW, DANIEL TOSH, ADRIEN BRODY, NOT YOU AT ALL. THAT'S AN AMAZING SHOW. - YOU'RE JUST TOO OLD FOR IT, DUDE. - RIGHT, RIGHT. - LET'S NOT PUSH YOU-- I MEAN, I WILL PUSH YOU, BUT LET'S NOT PUSH-- - YOU'LL PUSH ME, BUT I'M TOO OLD, AND YOU DIDN'T SEE ME. - YEAH. - IT'S GOOD, BECAUSE ACTUALLY I'VE GOT A LOT OF NOTES ON OUR MEETING AND IT'S-- - THOSE ARE YOUR NOTES? - HMM? - THAT'S JUST A-- THAT'S JUST A PICTURE OF A GUY. - WELL, IT'S NOT JUST ANY GUY. THAT'S ME AS AN ANGEL... - THAT'S YOU-- - GETTING A BLOW JOB. MY MEETING, OUR MEETING, OUR MEETING. WHERE WAS I WHEN I DREW THIS? - RIGHT. - I WAS HERE TALKING TO TOM MCCAFFREY. - SO THAT PICTURE OF THE GIRL BLOWING THE GUY WILL REMIND YOU OF THE SHOW IDEAS I HAD? - YEAH. - ♪ COME ON, SHOW THEM WHAT YOU'RE WORTH ♪ - THAT SONG. - [humming Firework] - YEAH, YEAH. - I MEAN, YOU'RE A LITTLE OLD FOR THAT SONG, BUT... - TOM AND I ARE VERY DIFFERENT, EVEN THOUGH WE'RE BROTHER AND SISTER. I HAVE A REAL JOB. I'M VERY SUCCESSFUL. I HAVE A LOT OF MONEY. AND HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY OF THESE THINGS. BUT HE'S VERY, VERY FUNNY. - [making farting noises] - OH, MAN. - LOOK EVERYONE. THIS IS MY DICK! LOOK AT IT. ONE THING THAT'S GOOD IS-- ABOUT BEING BACK IN THE SCENE IS--THAT I MISS IS, THERE'S, LIKE, A CAMARADERIE BETWEEN OTHER COMEDIANS. - DO YOU GUYS HAVE A LOST AND FOUND IN HERE? - OH, FOR SURE. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. - OKAY, 'CAUSE I LOST THIS SHIRT, AND I'M REALLY PERPLEXED AS TO WHAT HAPPENED TO IT. IT'S, LIKE, A BLUE AND WHITE FLANNEL SHIRT. - I JUST WANTED TO SAY THANKS. - OH, HEY, BABY. - THANKS A LOT. - OH, IS IT LIKE THIS BLUE? - YEAH, IT'S KIND OF LIKE THAT. - OH, OKAY.

YOU'RE WEARING MY SHIRT. - HOW DID I STEAL YOUR CLOTHES? - YOU'RE WEARING MY SHIRT. TONIGHT YOU'RE WEARING A YANKEES HAT. YOU DON'T THINK THAT'S WEIRD TOO? YOU'RE WEARING MY SHIRT, YOU STEAL MY CLOTHES, YOU STEAL MY JOKES, AND NOW YOU'RE STEALING MY TEAM. NOW YOU'RE DOING-- YOU JUST WANT TO DRESS LIKE ME. YOU LOOK EXACTLY LIKE ME. THE WAY I LOOKED ONSTAGE-- - I DON'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE YOU. - YEAH, THREE DAYS AGO BEFORE I LOST THIS SHIRT AND BEFORE I CALLED THE COPS AND STARTED THIS WHOLE THING, THIS IS WHAT I LOOKED LIKE... - RIGHT. - AND NOW YOU'RE LOOKING LIKE THIS. - RIGHT. I REALLY DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS. - GOOD, GOOD, AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE TIME ALSO WHEN YOU'RE IN JAIL, AND YOU KNOW WHAT? - OH, I'M IN JAIL-- ARE YOU A LAWYER? - YEAH, YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT? NO. BUT I AM FRIENDS WITH A SHERIFF. - IT'S A GOOD COMMUNITY. PEOPLE REALLY-- THEY SUPPORT EACH OTHER. THEY HELP EACH OTHER. - MY EX-BOYFRIEND HAS SMELLY BALLS.

[gentle music] ♪ I THINK WHAT HAPPENS IS, LIKE, YOU GET SOME CHANCES, AND THEN YOU'RE--YOU KNOW, YOU'RE EARLY-, MID-30s, AND IF YOU DON'T KIND OF BREAK TO THAT NEXT LEVEL, LIKE HAVING YOUR OWN SHOW OR SOMETHING, YOU CAN KIND OF JUST GET LOST IN JUST DOING SPOTS. - I NOW HAVE NO ACCESS TO OPPORTUNITIES, SOME OF WHICH I FEEL I DO DESERVE A SHOT AT. - I WAS KIND OF LIKE A HOT UP-AND-COMING COMEDIAN, AND I FEEL LIKE I TOOK IT FOR GRANTED AT THE TIME. AND IT'S HARD WHEN YOU HAVE THAT MOMENT, AND THEN YOU MAYBE STEP AWAY FOR A LITTLE BIT LIKE I DID-- I STEPPED AWAY-- AND THEN YOU COME BACK, YOU EXPECT IT TO BE THAT AGAIN, AND IT'S NOT. YOU HAVE TO WORK AGAIN TO GET TO IT, AND THAT'S REALLY FUCKING HARD. IT'S LIKE I HAVE THIS THING IN THE BACK OF MY HEAD THAT I COULDN'T, LIKE-- LIKE, GIVE THIS UP. I COULDN'T LET THE DREAM DIE. YOU KNOW, I TOLD YOU I, YOU KNOW, HAD THAT THING WHERE I WAS ON THE OSCARS WHEN I WAS REALLY YOUNG. AND I FEEL LIKE THAT PART OF ME NEVER DIED, THAT, LIKE, RIGHT THERE, SOMETHING, LIKE, CLICKED IN ME. THE EXPERIENCE HASN'T BEEN WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WHEN I WAS, YOU KNOW, 11 YEARS OLD. LIKE, I DIDN'T SEE ALL THE PAIN AND TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS I'D HAVE TO GO THROUGH ON THAT PATH. I TOLD MY MOM, "I'M GONNA GO BACK TO THE OSCARS ONE DAY TO PICK UP AN OSCAR." I'M RECORDING A CD. - OH, THAT'S-- I'M RECORDING A CD. - OH, THAT'S GREAT. - YEAH, I'M DOING A DOUBLE CD, ACTUALLY. - OH, OKAY. - YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, WITH A-- BUT SINGLE, THOUGH, THAT'S GREAT. - YEAH, YEAH, NO-- - YOU ONLY HAVE ENOUGH MATERIAL FOR ONE CD, RIGHT? - I'M DOING ANOTHER TV SHOW. - OH, WHAT SHOW? - IT'S VH1.

IT'S CALLED "SLEEP WITH MY FRIEND RALPH." I FEEL LIKE I'M, LIKE, ONE OF THE FUNNIEST AND ONE OF THE BEST, BUT IT'S-- IT HASN'T COME TO ME AS EASILY AS IT'S COME TO OTHER PEOPLE. - YOU KNOW, THERE WOULD BE SOME JEALOUSY. AND IT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE ALL-- EVERYONE'S TRYING REALLY HARD, AND IT'S FRUSTRATING. I MEAN, THE WEIRD THING ABOUT STAND-UP COMEDY IS THAT, OF ALL THE ASPECTS OF THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY, IT IS CLOSEST TO A MERITOCRACY. BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT'S MERIT-BASED. - I UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE GET UPSET, 'CAUSE IT'S A LOT OF UNFAIRNESS IN THIS BUSINESS. IT'S NOT LIKE SPORTS.
