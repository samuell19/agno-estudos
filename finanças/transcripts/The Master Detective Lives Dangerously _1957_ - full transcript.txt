A black cat... A black cat walks the town. Our remote little town dozed in the heat of summer. The dangers of the wider world are far far away. Here there's only quiet and peace. There's nothing fearful or dangerous here. Boo! Our town is in safe hands. Constable Bjork is here to help preserve our tranquility... ...together with master detective Charlie Blomkvist. It's not so tranquil here as you might think. Right now, crime is casting its long shadow over us. Tranquility can be deceptive. But fear not... the Master Detective is on guard. Nothing serious is going to happen. This time you were mistaken, Mr Master Detective. Here the war rages between Red and White Roses: The battle for the Grandfogey The scout on the roof could tell us where it was. But he clams up tight. The battleground is out in the wilderness... ...in the deserted haunted castle that Uncle Joel looks after... ...and the ruined hops towers down by the lake. In one of the towers, Grandfogey is now resting... ...unaware of the life and death drama about to unfold here. Do you know what a Grandfogey is? For grown ups without imagination, it's just a stone... ...but for the knights of the Red and White Roses... ...it has secret strengths... ...a priceless treasure... ...that you can spend all of summer fighting over. We're going to get Grandfogey! The Whites have had it for a week. We could take it to the haunted castle. Come on. You've got sweet cherries! Can I get a big bunch? Of course you can. There you are. Where are you going, Eva-Lott? I can't tell you... It's a secret mission. Super-secret! You be home in time for dinner. I'm in a hurry now! Eva-Lotta... I feel you should try to be a little more girlish. Girlish?! No way! 'Bye. Charlie! The Red Roses have declared war again! Read this! What should we do about it? What are they on about now? "To the leader of the criminal rabble..." ... "that calls themselves the White Roses." Nice beginning. ..."we hereby declare that in the whole of Sweden..." ..."there's not a single farmer with a pig as stupid..." "...as the leader of the White Roses." He's going to cop it for this!" - Read some more. - I think it'll get better. "Now it's war between the Red and White Roses." "And thousands and thousands of souls shall perish..." ..."in the dead of night." Sixten, nobleman, and leader of the Red Roses." Sixten is no more a nobleman than Johansson's pig! Come on, we'll race over to the haunted castle! I wouldn't mind getting an ice-cream first. Hi, Constable Bjork! Hi there, boys. So, the master detective has time for an ice-cream? No theft or murder cases? The thieves and murderers have time off. He doesn't have time. We're gonna cut off the Reds' ears. That'll be upersoo oolcoo. - What did you say? - Upersoo oolcoo. Super cool. In pirate-talk. Well... I get that. But surely you're not real enemies of the Reds? Don't you like Sixten or Bengt or Jonte? - Sort of. - They're our best pals. We like them a lot, but we're still gonna cut their ears off. Oh yes... children's happy games. Children's happy innocent games. "Children's happy games... oh yes!" Gren's a weird guy. My dad doesn't like him. He says that Gren's a Shylock. - What's he call him? - A Shylock. He's really mean. He lends money to people. Isn't that a nice thing to do? Nice? For example if you borrowed 25 cents from him... ...to buy an ice-cream... You'd have to pay him back 50 cents. 50, when I borrowed 25? No way! That's what shylocks do. Let's forget about Gren! Let's be off to the field of battle and victory! What can that be? Let's ask Uncle Joel. Yeah... he's the watchman for the place. Hey, watchman! Have you seen any Reds around? Maybe they're in the haunted castle. As if they'd dare! Anyway, we're the only ones who know how to get in. They're coming! Keep it down! What's that? A blade of grass. It's a fresh clue. They've been here. Someone's been chewing on it... ...just now. I'm going to sneeze! We have to spread out. Seek the enemy... wherever he may be... ...and put him out of action. We'll check out this way. Charlie... there's a message in there! Welcome! Now you've really got yourselves in the poo. Love from the Red Roses What do they mean by that? Let's get out of here! You can stay in there till the moss starts growing on you! Very funny, Bengt. Ha-Di-ha-ha. What do you want for Christmas? Your heads on a tray. With the usual pigs-head garnishes. Come on in Bengt, and get a Christmas present right now. What? Would you be happy with a black eye? Where's Anders? We have to find him! Couldn't we get out through here? Yes, perhaps. We'd get killed if we jumped. That wouldn't help. Calm down... I'll work something out. How? Just wait. You use what you've got. Do you give in now? Yes, we do Wouldn't want for you to wear yourselves out. Calm down! - Hear that? - Anders is caught! E-waa are ummingcaa!... Ate-graa! Shut your gob! We don't want to hear that crap. Annoyed, coz you can't understand, eh? Poor thing can't speak in pirate-talk. We'll find a way to squeeze it out of you. This is a really simple lock. Any baby could open it. with a bit of dexterity. Where are they taking Anders? We'll soon find out. - How are you going? - Just a routine job. A point to the White Roses!! We're unbeatable. They're going to think we went up in smoke. - But... - What, Charlie? An idea! A brilliant idea! The scarecrow!- Uncle Joel? The White's leader is invited to see Jonte. This is gonna be be fun! We can let go of you, if you promise not to run. No need! - Here's some string. - Thanks. The Reds are sure to fall into the trap. Boy, will they be scared! Great Charlie, but we have to go. I can't miss dinner. You buzz off and I'll fix this. Then we rescue Anders tonight. Ate-gra! - Eva-Lotta... - Yes? Have you finished your secret mission? No, we've only just started. "WE"...is that Anders, Charlie and you? That's right. Strange you only play with boys, Eva-Lotta. She takes after her mother. Remember the little Missy who ran around the woods playing Indians with us boys? I'd forgotten about that. Was that Mummy? How about this... "Brother-of-Eagles"... ask her who that was. Was that you, Mummy?! Brother-of-Eagles never wanted to go home to bed. Do you have to reveal that? Now we'll never get her home in the evenings. That won't happen. Thanks for dinner, Brother-of-Eagles. You're so good at cooking sausage and potato! I like having an Indian chief as a mum. She's the best Little Indian there is. A baker for father and Indian for mother... What a mixture! Pretty good mix, I'd say. Gotta run! See you, Brother-of-Eagles and Master-Baker! Hang on for a bit... We'll check things out. How are we going to see into the attic room? This is where we use criminal techniques! From a house opposite. Opposite? That's old man Gren's place. "Children's innocent games." No... then we can't. Hey... we could get up on Gren's roof! Not a bad idea. Though you don't know anything about criminal techniques. We just have to climb up. I'll go first. Careful... Gren's window is open. Gren's got visitors. They're talking in there. I'll take a look Charlie. Time is up. I can't wait for my money any longer. You bloodsucker! You've no call to talk like that. I'll see you tomorrow. The usual place. You mean the tower ruins? But I don't understand why you can't come here. Do as I say. Bring the IOUs. What was that about? They were carrying on about money. Did they see you? No. Say... Do you know what an I-O-U is? Yeah... It's a paper showing you owe someone money. You'll never find Grandfogey! No matter what. You'll get your sentence reduced, if you teach us pirate-talk. That gobbledegook you talk. No way! Don't be silly... You can say something in pirate-talk. My name, for example. YOUR name? "Umblestar Umbar". Imagine if Bengt realised it was "Stumble-bum" Where have you hidden Grandfogey? How shall we rescue Anders? We always come up with something. As I was saying... We always come up with something. Ah, you're ticklish! Fess up! Stop it! I'll tell you! It's in the tower ruins. I'll deal with Jonte. Keep your head down! Stop it, you idiot, it's me! It's me, Jonte! He's gone! Who shot out the light? Hello, Mr Gren. We're just playing. Oh yes, the happy games of childhood. The happy, innocent games of childhood. Well done, my brave warriors! We gotta scram! I'll fool them! So easy to fool those babies! They're dealing with grown-ups. Charlie's got a problem. Jonte has the school record for 100 metres. Maybe he climbed over here. This passageway's the only way out. This is old man Karlsson's place! Be careful! Here he is! You stop there... What's this all about? What are you doing here? We were just... You were just doing WHAT, in my yard? We got lost... Well just don't get lost in my yard again... ...or I'll set the police after you! Hello, Fredrik. Can I get... Hi there, Charlie... Sure you can. But you can see I'll be dead soon. You should hear the noise my stomach's making. I've caught you in the act, you dirty rat! Are you talking about me? Dad... I didn't know you were here...? I'm here to pay Fredriksson a house call. You've caught the dirty rat in the act. But now we're going home. Bye bye kiddy-o! Don't disturb the patient! Good night Frederiksson. You won't be dying for a while yet. You think so, doctor? Thanks. Good night. Charlie... do you know about cats? Let me tell you... they are real clever animals. They see and hear more than you could imagine. As cunning as blazes. But they won't reveal anything to anyone. You can't beat that. It's best to keep your nose out of other people's business. Charlie's at Fredrik's place. I have to keep my eyes and ears open, in my business. What sort of business would that be? The detective business. That's to say... If someone comes, tell them I left via the window. Have you seen Charlie Blomkvist? Yes... he jumped out through the window. Good. Come on! Would you like some lifebelts? Throw us down that cork brain of yours! It'd support an elephant! Enjoy yourselves... Go for a swim... It's good for the nerves! You know, Charlie... that was real good for my stomach. I feel quite good again. It's a pity about the oldies... the ones that are 20 to 30 who find it hard to keep up. Those who are starting to live in the past, are right that life today is out of control. They are all much the same, they know all about what's old and a couple of languages long dead. They get figs from one and animals from the other But all such things are forgotten when a new adventure pops up The sky is blue and beautiful and should always be that way Who could ever ask for more 'Bye Master-Baker and Brother-of-Eagles. Where are you going Eva-Lotta? I have to go to Headquarters. Another hugely secret mission? Exactly. 'Bye! Gosh, it's hot today! Can't do anything about it. I still have to fetch Grandfogey. Even though it's my fault. When you're tickled like that, you'd confess anything. I thought I'd go crazy. I said that I'd hidden it in the ruins. So you can fetch it, Eva-Lotta. I'd have gone myself, if I didn't have to work. And I have to stay here. I understand. I'll go. I can manage. You're a good warrior, Eva-Lotta. Tonight we'll find a new hiding-place. Look out... here I come! I wondered... what time is it? 2 o'clock. IOU Daddy, help me! Old Mr Gren... What's up with Gren? He's lying dead in the ruins! Hello, Vonstock police here. This is Detective Inspector Bern. Doctor Forsberg? Would you ask him to contact the police as soon as he comes in. My poor little pet! How is she, Dr Forsberg? She's suffering shock, and just needs to sleep. The inspector wants to talk to her as well. Not today. I absolutely forbid it. There tablets will put you to sleep. Thanks... I never want to wake up. I'll phone you later to see how she is. Thanks so much. Goodbye. Mummy, I never should have gone there! It was so horrible! I feel like I'll never have fun again. You have to try to forget about it. I can't. How can people be so terrible to each other? Yes... you do wonder, don't you? Mummy, I feel really old. I feel like I'm nearly 15. You see, Charlie, the doctor says I can't eat pickled herring. My stomach don't like it. But I says to the doctor... "Is it me stomach or me wot decides wot I can eat?"?" So, herring, please!! Here you are all standing around, just like sheep! As if there were no murderer! I mean, don't you know we have a murderer in this town! What on earth are you talking about? That's right, a murderer. Karl-August Gren's been shot. He's lying out there in the scrub, stone dead! Is that true? It's certainly true! The baker's daughter saw it all, poor kid! The doctor's with her. She's in quite a state, and so am I! I ain't surprised Gren come to a sticky end. He knew some pretty rum types! Did he? Poor Eva-Lotta! I have to go... I can't be exact, but... I'd say it happened between 1 pm and... 3.30 His watch and wallet are intact, so robbery wasn't a motive. Bjork! Do you know any particulars about Gren? He was known as a loan-shark. There could be a motive there. Fifteen men on a dead man's chest... Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum! Shut up! "Closed because of murder." Good eh? You can't write that! - Can't you? - No! Maybe you can't. I'll rewrite it. Hey, you can help the police, since you?re a master detective. - Anders... - Yeah? I'm not a real detective. What did you say? I'm not a real detective. But this is a real murder. I think it's horrible. Poor Eva-Lotta! Imagine running into a murderer! We'll put this up. Come on. CLOSED Due to the fine weather I really feel sorry for her. They say she's real depressed. Just lies down crying. And it's all my fault. I sent her to fetch Grandfogey. Hey you guys... Isn't there some way we can cheer up Eva-Lotta? Send her a flower, or something? What? A flower?! She's not dead though. You dope! You don't have to be dead to get flowers! I think we should do it. Sixten, can you get some greenery from your mum? I can try. What on earth...! Good morning, gentlemen! Hello... we thought... ...that Eva-Lotta might like flowers. But maybe she doesn't? That's awfully nice of you! I'm sure Eva-Lotta will be awfully happy yo get them. Thank you. We're not likely to get much out of the girl. Was her name Eva-Lotta? Yes, she was named after her grandmother. Yes, children's evidence is seldom of much value. Children find it difficult to make what we call objective observations. We can be lucky though, to pick up a crumb of information. I must tell you that Eva-Lotta always has her wits about her. You will be careful with her? Yes, we shan't make her more nervous than she already is, poor kid.. It's a pity about the oldies, those that are 20 to 30... ...and find it hard to keep up Those who've begun to gather memories, are right that our time is out of joint They're all much the same when they order their coffee... Eva Lotta, here are some flowers, so long as you're not dead. But you can only borrow them, as Sixten's mum needs them back. Blue is the sky here, and it should always be like that Eva-Lotta! She's coming. Can I stay while you're questioning her? No problem. Do you think she's afraid of me? Afraid? Are you dangerous? No. Good morning, Lisa-Lotta. Eva-Lotta. That's right... Eva-Lotta! Come and sit down and we'll have a chat. Then you can go and play with your dolls again. I stopped playing with dolls 10 years ago.. I see. Well then... How come you went all alone to the ruins yesterday? I can't tell you. It's secret. We're in the process of solving a murder case. So nothing can be secret. What were you doing out there at the ruins? I was to fetch Grandfogey. Brandbogey? Who is that? It's GRANDFOGEY, not Brandbogey I think I can explain, Inspector. There are the White Roses and the Red Roses here. And they fight over a stone called Grandfogey. We have to help Eva-Lotta somehow. We need to be there. The back way through the bakery, up to the kitchen! And bump straight into Eva-Lotta's mum. The down-pipe! Hounds-tooth trousers, moustache, black hair, 175 cm tall, age 30-35. Not bad. Nothing else, though? No, nothing else. Yes, there was a mark on his hand. What did it look like? I can't really remember. Some dots. I don't know what it was. Yes, he dropped an I.O.U.! And didn't notice. What did you say? What did he drop? A I.O.U. Don't you know what that is? People have lots of problems with I.O.U.s. Did you pick it up? What did you do with it? I forget. Eva-Lotta, we must find that piece of paper! You see, the criminal's name will be on the I.O.U. If we can find it, we'll know who shot Gren. Try and remember what you did with it. Make sure that every inch of the ruins is searched. Would you recognise that guy if you were to see him again? I'd know him anywhere. Had you never seen him before? Some of him. What do you mean? I saw his trousers when he sat in Gren's parlour. Where were you? On a ladder outside the window. Charlie and I were on the ladder. What were you doing on Gren's ladder?! Were you after another one of those Grandfogeys? Grandfogeys don't grow on trees! There's only one Grandfogey. Tell me Eva-Lotta... How do you know it was the criminal's trousers you saw? I didn't know. But knew it was him. I'd heard him say... "We'll meet tomorrow at the ruins, and bring every I.O.U. then." Thank you. You've been very helpful. Just forget about this now. Now I'll see Charlie, so I can get Eva-Lotta's details confirmed. Where can we find him? Here! At your service, Inspector! One can't avoid risking life and limb any longer! You can't go to sleep in case there's a murderer under the bed! He'd be even more frightened of you, I imagine. This is no laughing matter, Eriksson! You wouldn't be laughing if a bandit pointed a gun at you and shouted "Hands up!" No, that's not good. But I'm sure we'll soon have him in custody. Anyhow, I'll be telling the editor a few home truths! So you should. Sextuplets! That wasn't bad! Nice item. Regards to your wife! Sextuplets! That's quite a pig! You're quite a pig yourself! What are you talking about? It's criminal to write what you did! Don't you see the danger for Eva-Lotta?! In what way? There's nothing I've written that's incorrect. You're even stupider than I thought. I guy that's killed someone can do it again... ...if he thought it necessary. Look how thoughtless you were... First you write that she's the only one who can identify him. Then you include her name and address! You could have included the phone number so he could ring and make an appointment. Look at this... "Kind people have already sent the little heroine..."- Little heroine! ... "toys, books and quantities of sweets and chocolate." Speaking of chocolate... Shut up about chocolate. I must've eaten a kilo! To arms! Here comes Grandfogey! Good of Bjork to fetch it! Have some chocolate. Eva-Lotta got stacks. Grandfogey, did you manage to evade the police? Good for you! We have to find an exciting hiding place for Grandfogey. The poor old guy. I think he's had enough of exciting places. We'll find a different sort of exciting place. We've got to be quick. The Reds will be furious. - So what? - Wait, I'll tell you. How about hiding it in the Reds' headquarters?! Are you crazy? Give it back voluntarily?! I get it! The Reds keep Grandfogey without knowing it! That's right! Think how angry they're going to be, when long afterwards, we tell them! We can hide it in Sixten's room. I know how to sneak in while he's asleep. I know exactly where to hide it! You have to take something from there... ...so Sixten knows you've been there. He sleeps like a log. How about we scalp him? Wouldn't a lock of hair from Sixten be great? Really great! But what do you say if he wakes up? I'd say I was just checking he had his duvet on. Sixten will go bananas! And the Reds will fall for the trap of the haunted castle... ...where they're defeated! Another anonymous letter... "The tailor has a delinquent son..." ..."who has black trousers. He's it. So arrest him." The person who wrote it knows that the trousers play an important role.. ...but he seems to think that pants are always scary! Now nobody dares wear hounds-tooth trousers. That's been the only result of publicising that. We've hit a brick wall, we have to admit. And that I.O.U. is driving ME up the wall. Is it really all that difficult to find it? No trace of it... just like the murderer. There must be some way he'll reveal himself. Sixten! Sixten! Yes? What is it? Auntie Ada is here. Come and say hello. So I get to sleep in the attic room. You've nothing against Auntie borrowing your room, do you? No... she can have it. Gosh, I'm full! I couldn't eat a thing That's alright. We're having steamed cod today. Fish makes you intelligent. You need to eat a lot. Never ever! But how much would I have to eat? That depends on how intelligent you are to start with. One small whale a week for you. No way! I wonder if any more goodies have come. Maybe chocolate. Oh yuck! Some day you'll be eating bark for chocolate. Keep it for when you're hungry. Now I have to go home and eat cod. Then I'll stick my head into the jaws of the enemy. It'll happen tonight. I'll be here first thing in the morning to report. See you. Beppo! It's only me. Have some chocolate... That'll shut you up. What are you going on about in the middle of the night? You can go outside. What were you screaming about, dear? There was a burglar in here! There's no burglar here. You've been dreaming. Why hasn't Anders come? What if he was caught! Maybe he was given a job to do. We'll go look for him. Look, here he comes. He doesn't look happy. Are you sick? What's wrong? Are you suffering from the heat? I'm suffering from steamed cod. I've told Mum 1000 times I can't stand fish. - Now I've got proof. - How? I've been up and down all night, spewing. And Grandfogey? That was a total success. Grandfogey is now inside Sixten's globe of the world. Tell us about it! Didn't Sixten wake up? Yeah, the whole house woke up ! If I hadn't given Beppo the chocolate, I would've been a gonner! Lucky he liked eating it. The main thing is that Grandfogey's in the globe. Hi, Sixten, have you found Grandfogey yet? Maybe. Maybe not. "Maybe not" is more likely. You'll never find it. You've got to give us a clue. I'll give you a clue. Search in the bowels of the Earth. I don't care about Grandfogey. Beppo's sick. Beppo sick? He was quite OK last night! Yeah... But how would YOU know? I'm a bit of a clairvoyant. Can we see how he is? Yeah, come on. He's sure to get well. I'm suffering from steamed cod. I was up all night, spewing If I hadn't given Beppo the chocolate, I would've been a gonner! No more detective-grilling, Charlie. We've had enough of it. Let's go to sleep. Some day you'll be eating bark for chocolate. Bark for chocolate... It's all imagination... Same as usual. But one can always carry out a bit of routine investigating. I'll do the Marsh test for arsenic. First I produce hydrogen... ...using sulfuric acid and zinc. I pour sulfuric acid into the hydrogen apparatus... ...so it drips down onto the zinc pieces. There's a chemical reaction. Hydrogen is released into the flask. When I introduce the arsenic, hydrogen arsenate is formed. That goes through the tube, and can be heated. An arsenic coating occurs at the constriction of the tube... called the arsenic mirror. The gas has been driven out. I test by igniting the hydrogen. Powdered chocolate is dissolved in distilled water, stirred and filtered. I pour the solution into the hydrogen apparatus. I heat the tube at the constriction. It's arsenic! Anders! Anders! What's burning? Did you taste the chocolate you gave to Beppo? Why ask me that in the middle of the night?! There was arsenic in the chocolate! How horrible! Yeah, I licked it off my fingers. Officer Bjork! Eva-Lotta received chocolate that had arsenic in it! - What in it? - Arsenic! - Arsenic? How do you know? - I analysed it in my lab. Really? Well now...! It could be a mistake... but we won't take any risks. I'll send you this chocolate right away by car. So you should have a result within a couple of hours? Do you have any of that chocolate left? No, Beppo ate all of it. - In your pants pocket then? - No, Mum washed them last night. I must say, one thing is peculiar. What were you doing in that house in the middle of the night? What were you doing? Out with it!! - It was Grandfogey! - Don't tell me it was that Grandfogey again! Grandfogey! There's sure to be chocolate on it, from Anders' hands! Well then, Mr Grandfogey had better make himself available for police investigation. How are things with Beppo? Is he better? Yes, but it was looking bad there for a while. Here he is, Inspector. Hi, Sixten. We came to get Grandfogey. In the bowels of the Earth! We'll just take one more. This one? Think about it. It's not definite that he has a moustache. Alright, we'll try the next one. This one? They all look like they're really nice. So Charlie was right. Thanks. Goodbye. What was that about Charlie? There WAS arsenic in the chocolate. What a creep he is! Beppo could have died! A poor dog who never hurt anyone! One thing I'm sure of... That I.O.U. has to be found. The police realise that, too. They've been looking for it day and night. It's not enough just to look. The problem has to be analysed! Theoretically and scientifically. Listen to The Master Detective! Right! We can help the police find it. A breakthrough is needed You think you dropped the I.O.U. at the ruins? I'm not really sure. We'll work it out. There was a sou'-sou'-west wind that day. So the I.O.U. would be half way to Finland by now? Trying to be funny? By my calculations it could be stuck in that big pile of stones. What stones? They're 50-100 m north-east of the ruins. You're a wizard. Shall we go and look? Not me! You have to come. Things might come back to you when you're there. No! I don't want things to come back to me. Nice boat, eh?! That's strange... There's never been boats there before. No flag or pennant. Very mysterious. Come on, we're looking for the I.O.U. Come on! I've never seen such a small piece of paper! Me neither. It seems whatever paper might have been here, has gone. And no I.O.U. Probably on its way to Finland. This was useless. It should be here somewhere. The Master Detective is right! Here's a piece of paper. I think so. It's a deep hole. We can't reach it. We'll get a stick and a nail and spike it. Like the cleaners in the park. Where will we get a nail? In the haunted castle. - How are you going? - Nearly got it. Great! Now we'll see. Don't drop it! It's for you, Anders. Eat fish! Be healthy! Can't escape it! You look a mess. Wear a skirt. Mums are such pains! Yes, everything that you forget when adventure's 'round the corner - Eva-Lotta! - I have to see Charlie and Anders! Think of anything else? No. can you? No. See if there's any action with the Reds. Shall we take a look? Better than sitting here, looking stupid. Charlie! Anders! Charlie! Anders! Charlie! Anders! - Hello. - Hello. I thought I saw someone I knew. No, it was just me. Haven't we met before? No, not that I remember. What might your name be, little girl? Eva-Lotta Lisander. Well that's not someone I know. Are sure we haven't met before? No, never. What's so funny? Just something I thought of... that was nice. Anyway, what are you doing here? I was looking for Charlie and Anders. Friends of mine. Do you play here? No, we're looking for a piece of paper. You've been looking for a piece of paper? Yes. Now we've finally found it. Where are Charlie and Anders now? Nearby. Charlie! Anders! Hi! Hi, boys! You left the little lady all alone. I've been talking with her while you were out looking for paper. Come on in, boys. I've got something cool for you to do, you can earn money for. Earn money? That sounds great! [In code: "he's the murderer"] Hurry up! I'm in a hurry. "The murderer"! Come with me, Eva-Lotta. Come, I said. What shall we do? I don't know. We can't leave Eva-Lotta here alone. You don't say! Come here, kids. Don't look so frightened No... It's late... We need to go home. We'll earn that money some other time. We're off. Wait a sec! You're not in any hurry. That piece of paper... Hand it over. Right now! Aren't you listening? Who has the piece of paper? What paper? The only paper we have is this. I know you've got it. Hand it over, Now! Now! We've hidden it... in the room upstairs. Get moving! Otherwise I know a way to really speed you up! The trap! Uncle Joel! Listen to me...! Give me that paper now! - But... - No buts! If I don't have it in 5 seconds... It's in there. - Shall I get it? - Oh no! Stand against the wall. Quick! Against the wall. The pistol! He'll be out soon. I'll see to his boat. Run for your lives! Officer Bjork! Car 5. Boat heading for Norrsundet. Shoot then. Give me the gun. Anyway, you don't have the guts to shoot. Bravo, Charlie!
