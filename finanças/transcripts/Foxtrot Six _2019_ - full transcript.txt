The global economy continues to collapse as food prices spike. The world population has now reached its eighth-billion mark. Food has now replaced oil in becoming the most prized commodity. California has now broken its all-time record for the longest heatwave. We now have more than eight billion mouths to feed. Even the slightest drop in our world food supply can mean the total collapse of our way of life. Indonesia promises to be the leading food basket of the world, as Indra Siswadi, the youngest elected President in the history of the country... No more hunger! ...declared his mission in aiding the new World Hunger Prevention Initiative. In times like these, we can't help but ask, is this the beginning of the end? Hungry? Starving. Wake up. You got that same squirm the first time we met. I don't squirm. All right, maybe a little. It feels wrong letting you go this time, I guess. Yo, Sari! We got the one-on-one with Indra. Let's go! As in the Presidential-elect, Indra? He's gonna change the world, you know. Save a lot of people. You should come. As soon as I get myself straight. Listen... I got something for you. There's no stone yet, so, I guess it won't be official until... But I will. I mean... As... As soon as... Shut the fuck up. Can a proposed girl get a minute here? I'll take that as a yes? You'll have to ask for my parents' blessings first, dummy. They'd kill you if they found out about this. Copy that. Ask me again when I get back. And next time, don't mumble. Yes, ma'am. Wake up. Morning, Mr. Congressman. Thank you for last night. Good morning. It is 8:00 a.m. The future is now. Puninar. Your trusted solutions partner and the logistics of the future. Play on. All right. What is it this time? PIRANAS delinquents, please stay behind the fence and remain calm. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Attention. Please stay behind the fence and remain calm. Get back inside! Mama. Mama! Please proceed to the filtering facility in an orderly manner. All citizens must stand in line to secure your weekly ration quota. You a Marine girl? Sergeant Raya, sir. How'd you figure that, sir? Well, let's just say you and I both know how to respect the quiet, unlike the Air Force. Yes, sir. This is Level One PIRANAS Military. All personnel must uncover their faces and heads for facial identification. Ah, Mr. Secretary. - How's it hanging, sir? - Shriveled. Licked by many, deformed by all the bullshit. But I digress. I regret I asked. Listen. It is a gross understatement to say... that it's difficult for me to get this kind of meeting. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Do not embarrass me. Mr. President. Congressman Angga. The man I've been telling you about. Mr. President. As you must already know, in the cowboy hat, Mr. Hengky Laksono. Man in charge of all things public media. More handsome in person than on TV, I'm sure. General Adnan Atmadja, Commander of the GERRAM Paramilitaries. And the head of the PIRANAS Party himself, Mr. Farid Baskoro. It's a pleasure to finally meet you, sir. I like to think of them as the four pillars of PIRANAS. More like the four horsemen. Impressive job on that Farmer's Bill. Looks like you wanna be on the winner's team. Always, Mr. President. But... enough with the ass-kissing. Truth is, gentlemen... you suck at PR. - Angga. - Let him speak. You see, our economy... well, it may be in the lead. But, the biggest threat... still lies within. Gentlemen, the people are starving. Their nationalism, morale... dying. So, you're saying we need to cut our profits and fight world hunger bullshit? I'm saying, all they need... is a dream. Something that'll take their minds off the hunger. A promise of a better future. A Heroic Act. You see, gentlemen, The Reform, they're secretly gaining massive followers. Promising more food for all. And whether you like it or not, the people will side with anyone who can offer them change. And these guys, they're saying exactly what they want to hear. You're looking at a ticking time bomb strapped to your ass. What are you proposing? We destroy their idea. Regains the people's trust. PIRANAS gets a new face-lift. Then, we can enjoy our riches in peace. I volunteer for the lead. Black Ops. Off the books. And in return... I want 1% of what PIRANAS makes. Every year... for the rest of its days. Holy shit. I hate it when you do that. Tell me I got it. Don't know how you pulled that shit off. But... you got it, kid. What's this? The catch. They want you to lead the operation with The Wolf himself. Wisnu. What? Get me back in there. You walk in there... we'll lose this opportunity forever. I dislike the guy as much as you do, you know that. But they trust his ass more than yours. Do not screw this up. Finally, the four old men... have come to their senses. The hunger has turned us against each other. No. It only shows you who you really are. Guess we'll be working together again. People are savages, don't you think? We like to believe we're better than animals. But the truth is, we kill. We feed off each other just the same. Just the same. In this jungle, either you eat... or be eaten. Take a look. Prototype suit. Shipped this morning. American. My God. An invisibility cloak? Yes. They call it "The Hide." Combine military-grade LED Kevlar with nano cameras within the seams. First, the UAVs, the Kodiaks, and now this. They're licking our asses clean. Speaking of tactics, your so-called Heroic Act is... no offense, idiotic. We are here to preserve order, not practice democracy. Well, I'm not here for your opinion. You're still the same mutt I met years ago. And me? Still head of this operation. So, fall in. You know... I used to love dressing up like Rambo. Thought I'd be more respected. It taught me a very, very valuable lesson. Oh, yeah? What's that? Fear! Unlike in the movies, real people, primitives... have no respect for bravery, or kindness, or heroes. Only fear. You wanna stop your Reform? The only way is to exterminate them. You've got company. All units, black quad drone! North side! Don't let it get away! Go! Hey. Hey, you! Somebody... Shoot! Hey! Hey, stop! Hey, you. Stop! Bitch! Right there! Stop right there! Hands. I wanna see them now! Who do you work for? Turn around, slowly! The smart pad, toss it over! Hey, do you hear me? I'm a government official, on duty. People will be looking for me. Stay back! Weapons down, now! Stop! Sari? Lower your guns. I know this man. He's not one of 'em. I... I thought you were dead. What does Wisnu know about us? You joined the Reform? If you can't get me what I need, - then you should leave. - Sari, wait! Come with me. I've got everything we've ever wanted. I can protect you... You helped incite the Revolution. You really think I didn't know that? I covered corruption stories for breakfast, for God's sake. I did it for us! Don't you see what this world has become? Hey, do you hear me? Mom. Pack your things, honey. We're leaving. I get it. And you're blaming me! She's yours. What? Since I found out you were involved, Indra was being hunted... We went underground, spent years building this Reform together. You founded the Reform? You've been fed on lies, Angga. Then I just gave you the death sentence. Get out! Now! Who's in charge? Where's the great Reform's hideout? Guns! Guns! Clear! Alert the Party. The Congressman is now an enemy of the state. Of all places, abandoned shopping mall? We call it home. He's with us! Sari, Dinda, you all right? Spec. Where's everyone? We're it. Who's he? He helped us escape. He's clean. If I was a spy, this place would've been burned to the ground. Sorry you had to be here. What are you trying to achieve? You want your presidency back, is that it? I used to. I fought so hard for what this country would be... could be. Then, it all just... faded. The people, they need to know what they're really suffering for, Congressman. Greed. Corruption. That's why we're here. Nothing more. Then what are you waiting for? You've got your army with you. They seem equipped and ready. Walk with me. They were my voters. Believed in me. But now they're... here. But these people, and the one that died today... volunteered. For me. You call them army. I call them family. If it wasn't for Spec, we would've never learned to defend ourselves. Who is this Spec? Never knew his real name. Sari found him on the streets. Saved him... just like she saved me. Then give me that one phone call. I'll guarantee her safety for the rest of her life. You have one minute before they track us down. - Soeganda. - Ganda, it's me. Listen. I don't have much time. Angga, what the hell happened? They're accusing you of helping the separatists, for God's sake. I've found her, Ganda. I've found Sari. Kid, it's too late. Your name is on the GERRAM kill list. Wisnu has taken your plan and skewed it into one of his own. And whatever it is, it'll be carried out in three days. In three days? That's impossible. Ganda, you've gotta help me stop him, or I'll be dead. Do you hear me? Sari will be dead. Son... I love you like my own, but you cannot win everything. I'm sorry. Good luck out there. I wanna meet him. That takedown... straight-out military. Look, I'm putting together an attack team. I want you in. I'm in. Let me get this straight. - You want the five of us... - Six. Pardon me, six. ...to go after the adorable Wisnu and his huggable thugs, to stop an unknown PIRANAS conspiracy? Let's see, they have a name for that. What is it? Oh, yeah, it's treason! Are you fucking nuts? We'd... be dead. D-E-D. Dead! Besides, look at us. We've probably forgotten half the things we used to do. And who the fuck is this National Geographic? Innocent people's lives - are at stake here. - Oh, bullshit, LT. Since when do you care, huh? Hey, maybe Wisnu is right. Maybe they are terrorists. Maybe they all deserve to die. I found her, Ogs! Sari. And a little girl that turns out to be mine. All of us, we're at the top of the kill list. Is everything okay in here? I hope you don't mind - the powder tea. - Ma! Will you just get out? Just trying to help. Look... I feel you. And PIRANAS, man, I'd shove it up their bumhole any day of the week. But I can't. I... I just can't. Then we'll show ourselves out. It was nice seeing you again, Ogs. You must be so disappointed in me. Son, you've always chosen your own path. And you've always pulled through. Disappointed? You're just waiting for an opportunity to impress... not just me, but the whole world. LT! Could use the exercise. Come on! I'll show you where the guys are. Which one is he? The one with his face on the floor. Look, it's good to see you guys and all, but... really not into reunions. Isn't that oil all over you? So? No reason. Listen, Bara... - We got a job for you. - Yeah. It's one of those won't-make-it-out-alive kind. So it's a suicide mission? When do we start? What's in it for me? I told you the amount. You'd be worry-free for the next decade. Oh, stop. We all know how it is. Last cash lasted us, what, huh, four, five years tops? Why do you think they demoted me? Bullshit graveyard-shift, checking every damn door in the PIRANAS Tower before they finally fired me? Oh, come on, Tino. Where was our beloved LT when the Corp kicked us out? He got that shiny brand-new job passing dirty bills. With taxpayers' money. Our money. All right, leave us. But... What do you want, Tino? Finally. You might've fooled the herd, not me. I want what you have. You think a fancy watch will change my mind? Plus a quarter... of everything in my stash. Now, are you in... or out? Yeah. LT! Actually, I was in the middle of my vlog. Um, so if you don't mind... - I gotta get outta here. - Just... - Yo, freckle dick. - Yo. - You son of a... - Hey! Guys, guys, guys, stop! Hey, hey. Hey! Ethan, I need the best tech. I need you to find some very classified information on the PIRANAS VIP server. The PIRANAS server? You gotta be shitting me. Look. We're not supposed to tell you this, kid, but... It's a top-secret... recruitment test. What? Only a lucky few get selected. You pass this one, all eyes will be on you, kid. You'd be famous. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait. Uh... Acting gigs, red carpet famous? Sky's the limit. All right. Here goes nothing. Move! Move! Stand back! Get out! Get out of my face. - Get back! - Heads up. We've got company. They tracked us. Shit! - We've gotta get outta here. - Wait. - Who's "they"? - How much more time? - This isn't a test, is it? - How much? Come on, come on, come on! Move! Move! Done. I'm done. Holy shit! This can't be right, can it? Tomorrow's date. Click on that. What is this? Nothing but PIRANAS Senators' profiles. No. These are targets. Sacrificing their own Senators, scapegoating the Reform. Wolves in sheep's clothing. It's a false-flag attack. There'll be murders and riots. Give something for the people to be angry about. A government-sanctioned genocide. - Left, clear. - Right, clear! All clear! Get the cavalry. Electrical manual? Hey, do you know when your mother and I first met? We were instantly drawn to each other. You know, like electricity. She used to say, "If you come any nearer, "I'll tase you in the face." Anyway... Thought I'd make up for the lost time. I found it in the old bookstore. A free fox pin included in the back page, too. Look, I know I wasn't there for you... Wake up. A children's fable? She's 12, not five. She's stubborn. Wonder where she got it from. You know... I never really had the chance to say thank you, for... what you and the boys did. So, thank you. Is it a good time to meet your parents now? Oh, you'll never get a chance to see them now, slick. You're the bastard who knocked me up and left me. Never again. What? Don't mumble. I'll never leave you again. Maybe it's too late. I heard about the attack plan tomorrow. There's no turning back from that. Hey, guys. Let's get up on the double. Moving out. Tino, you're one of the smartest people I know. You're gonna start telling me it's impossible? Fucking hell. We'll think simple. Subtract. What is this? For the Reform! - Ganda! - Angga! No time to explain. Let's go! Move, move! Move, move! Go, go, go! Go, go, go. Go, go! Move, move, move. Get in the car! Stick to the plan. I'll tell you where to go. Copy that. - Smoke 'em out! - Smoke 'em out! Let's go! Package is secured! Let's go, let's go, let's go! I'm on it. You go. Spec, no! Holy shit! We've got Kodiaks. We gotta get out of here! Go, go, go! Get in! Let's go! Let's go! No. Sari! No! Wasn't easy or cheap! But whatever you manage to destroy... we fix. Oh, my God. Spent a lifetime searching for this filthy rabbit hole. But now that I'm here... it feels like home. What did you do to her? No, put that away. She's just pretty beat up from putting up a mean fight, is all. Killed three of my men. Why don't you tell your men to drop their antique toys... before I put a hole in her face. Roll, please! Long live the Reform. No! And that's it! Quick, simple, graphic. Just how the people want it. You fuck! Well, I got a surprise for you. Congressman! Congressman, here! Dinda! Dinda, you all right? Mama! Dinda! Mommy's okay, baby. Mama's all right. Look, you win, all right? The Reform is finished! What else do you want from me? You like making deals, right? So here's one for you. You see this remote? Say, "I see it." - I see it! - Good. It triggers the bomb I planted on the elevator's cable. Set it to... one minute. So you gotta choose how you spend that minute. Save your woman, or your kid. But if I were you, I'd use it to haul my own ass out of here. You've shown what you would do for the ones you love. Now show them who you really are. Hey, you. You will die in pieces. Let him be. And kill the others. Move! Hold on, honey! Hey, Dinda. What are you doing? What are you doing? She's in there! Get off me! Stop! Stop... Will you stop it? No! You killed my daughter, you monster! Get off of me! Hold on! - The emergency brakes. - Mama! - We're okay! - Do you hear that? Dinda's fine. I'm gonna get you up. Don't you give up... Ah, shit! Angga! Listen to me! You take care of her. Tell her... be brave for the new world to come. Sari, please. I can't lose you again. Wake up. You never did. Papa! I'm here! Listen to my voice, Papa! Papa! Over here! Just follow my voice! Papa! Dinda, honey. I can't. I don't know what to do. Listen. We're gonna be okay. Get to the emergency staircase! We need you to pull us out. Come on! Focus! Hold on. Papa! - Dinda! - We're back here! Angga! I'll get us help! What are you waiting for? Pull! Hold on! Sergeant. They know everything. Never a big fan of PIRANAS anyway, sir. We're here to help. Who told you? It has been eight excruciating hours since the capital kidnapping incident this morning. Seven senators have been held hostage so far, with no signs of demand by the Reform separatists. That is, until recently, when an anonymous video was made public for the world to see. Warning. What you are about to see is graphic and may disturb you. Who are we kidding, huh? How could six has-beens stop the government in three days? We were fucked from the start. What are you doing? Leaving. Job's done, remember? Our mugs are registered on the top of the wanted list, Tino. No shit. If we stay here, we're dead. Where do you think you're going? The PIRANAS Tower. Why? How? - Never mind. - Tino. No, no, no, it's fucking brilliant. Even if we do manage to get inside the gates... The Tower's like a maze. We can't make it to the second floor, let alone the VIP chamber. Yeah, but you can. You said it yourself, you used to work graveyard there. You know its every floor plan, inside and out. Maybe you've forgotten, but they just butchered us out there! Including his precious girlfriend! I'm going back. I'm going back. I am going back! I'm going back. Un-fucking-believable. You two deserve each other! Sir, couldn't help but hearing. The presidential address is only hours away. Even if you were able to stop them, you won't make it there in time. Sir. Not by driving, anyway, sir. I'll tell them you hijacked it. Thank you, Sergeant. I'm afraid we can't join your fight, sir. - We're still under constant... - I'm not asking you to. Help as many people out there as you can, Sergeant. Oh, and sir... I think this belongs to you. They were tearing your place apart, so I kind of stole it. Good luck out there, sir. If, uh... - If I don't come back... - You will. So, shut up. You're just like your mother. Go get them, Pa. Ready engine one. Ready engine two. Clear skies. Ready for take-off. Hold on. Someone's coming. Two minutes! Gather up. We got a one-hour window before the cavalry comes in. Maybe less. Remember, you only need one confession to stop all this. Tino? Our best point of entry is the holding area, here. But in order to get there, we have to circle around the construction sites, here, and the trucking hold, here. It's our best bet in making it to the Tower alive. We'll split into four teams. Ethan, you're the key. Go to the main control room. Override the system. Lock down their security gates, doors, and helipad access. You open only the ones leading up to the VIP chambers. - You got all that? - Any backup, sir? You're on your own this time, kid. Yes, sir. Oggi, Tino... you guys are in charge of the explosives. Spec? South watch tower. 360 kill zone. Bara, you stay with me. Millions of lives are at stake tonight. They're counting on us. And me... I'm counting on you. Go, go, go, go! Go, go! Go! Attention. The state of martial law has been issued. In position. Clear. Three, two, one. Execute. Target neutralized. Left, clear. Right, clear. All clear. Hold for visual. We got a confirmed, VIP vehicle exiting compound. Positive ID. Farid Baskoro. - Shit! - Let him go. Remember, we only need one of the PIRANAS Four anyway. Let's do this. The national curfew is in effect. It is chaos here in the city, as the nation is on lockdown, the borders closed and a curfew issued, due to the nationwide manhunt. All citizens must remain indoors until... You two, hands up! Now! Get... Shit. I can't believe I'm doing this. Get the strike squad. Check the control room. Last one up. Hope they all work. RV's clear. Ethan, strike squad is en route. Main exits compromised. Ethan, get the hell out of there now. Wait. I need more time. Ethan, do you hear me? Get out, now! Move! Shit, he's compromised. They're gonna be here any second. Kid, if you hear me... we have to go. I'm sorry. Do it. Sons of bitches! No! It's a distraction. Security breach. They're here for the VIPs. Go to the construction site. You stop them. You heard him! Let's move out! I'll hold them off. They're gonna catch up on us and you know it! Me and this butter face, we got unfinished business. Guess I'll see you inside. Why don't you tell your friends to come out? I have no friends. No weapons. No vest. Just me. If that's how you want it. You're gonna shoot an unarmed man? Come on. Put a bruise on me. Break my arm... something. Let's make this simple, then. All of you against me. Holster your weapons. Let's show this clown what pain really feels like. Damn. I don't have all day. Get the fuck up. Hell... three out of five. Ain't bad. Gotta hand it to you. You got some spirit. Still breathing, asshole. You wanted me to break your arm. Wash your mouth. What did you say? You should wash your fucking mouth! Security breach. Security breach. Security breach. We got activity. Kodiaks! Covering fire! - Frags out! - Frags out! Fuck, I'm hit! I'm hit! Armor's blind without the camera. Spec, tell me you got a visual. - Sniper, top side. - Go! Let's go, let's go. Spec, take their camera out. Spec, you're breaking up. Ogs! Spec, take the shot. Spec, take the fucking shot! Hey, fatso! Ogs! Ogs. Ogs. No, no, no. Left vest pocket. - What? - Left vest pocket. I'm gonna get you some help, Ogs. You... are gonna clear up this whole mess... right, LT? You're gonna save those people. Right? Damn right, we are. I must be such a disappointment. Security breach. They're coming. We gotta go. Security breach. We gotta go! Security breach. Security breach. Congressman! Commander Adnan. This ends now! The Four... They're gonna get away. Both of us... we're gonna finish this. If you really believe in this, then you better hurry the fuck up. An elevator... It'll take you straight to the VIP chamber. I'll see you on the other side. He's breaking in! Split up! On me! Game over. What? No, no, no, no. Move, move! Come on, you sons of bitches. Every man for himself. Unbelievable. How many lives do you got, Congressman? LT, come on. Ethan? Get behind me! Get that hatch opened. Wait. Don't kill me! Down on the floor! Get down on the floor right now! Confess PIRANAS' conspiracy on record. Authorize your company and broadcast it live, nationwide. Are you fucking crazy? They'll put me in front of the firing squad. Authorize it. Make the call. It's me. There'll be an incoming video upload through the central PIRANAS server. Just broadcast it as soon as you receive it. Nationwide. Live. "Do it, or your ass is fired." Do it, or your ass is fired. Confess. My name is Hengky Laksono. I am here tonight... to tell... - Ethan, no! - Stop. Just stop. What the hell happened here? Relax, Mr. President. Everything is under control. Systems back online and Garuda One is ready to go. Congressman Angga. You used to have everything. But now... you're just like them. I never planned for a genocide! You and your PIRANAS flag did that! But I'm not the one who's committing genocide, Congressman! The people are! You fed them a lie, for God's sake! Great things are done with extreme measures. You showed us that tonight. Destroyed the enemy's image, restored the people's faith in us. All in less than a week. Brilliant, Congressman. Brilliant. Now, if you please excuse me... I have a public to address. My, uh... "Heroic Act," as you call it. Goodnight, Congressman. And he's gone. It's over. Now, tell me. Was she worth it? Did you really think people would stop just because of some stupid confession video? Those primitive will burn, steal, rape and kill all they want. You know why? Because the hungry cares not for justice. Only for their own stomach. But you're wrong. What they care for... is to see you dead! Get the fuck out of here! Will you look at that? Huh? Last bullet! Oh, don't look at me like that. You think I'm the bad guy? You have no idea what monsters this world can create! You chose them! So, bleed for them! Pleasure working with you again, Lieutenant! PIRANAS! PIRANAS! PIRANAS! PIRANAS! PIRANAS! PIRANAS! My beloved countrymen... this morning... the Reform has committed their most heinous and cowardly act of terror. I am angry. I am furious! With this law, every citizen... is now legally responsible for all members of the Reform. Starting tonight, your hunger will be fulfilled! We will hunt down those separatist traitors to the ground! So, let the manhunt begin! PIRANAS! PIRANAS! Done with it. So... done with it. PIRANAS! PIRANAS! PIRANAS! PIRANAS! PIRANAS! You used to have everything. What is this? Who put this up? But now... you're just like them. I never planned for a genocide! - Hey, shut it down. - You and your PIRANAS flag did that! - Shut it down, now. - But I'm not the one who's committing genocide, Congressman! The people are! You lied to us! Good citizens... Hear me. This is a setup. Just another of those Reform's plots. And, listen... Get me out of here, now! Get out of my way. I said, get the fuck out of my way. That motherfucker. It's been a week since the President's infamous confession leaked and went viral. The President and his administration are being labeled as suspects, and will be put on trial sometime next week. The question still remains, is the President a patriot or a traitor? But recently, there may be arguably bigger questions at play. Who is this man behind the camera? Who the people are now calling, "the hero of the new Republic." We now know that his name is Ethan Suryadi, a former Indonesian Marine officer turned small-time vlogger. Did Ethan work alone? Who else was involved? It seems like we'll be getting more questions than answers. At least, for now. Good look on you. Not so bad yourself. I guess you found Spec's body. No. It was just blood. Lots of it. He couldn't have survived it. And Tino? Bailed. No goodbye, nothing. Who knows what he's up to. Excuse me. Permission to return this. In honor of your son, ma'am. You were with him. What was he like? Best man I've known, ma'am. Best man I'll ever know. That's my son. Hungry? No. No, I'm good. The book you gave me... The fox pin and the last pages were burned in the fire. Guess I'll never know the ending. We'll just have to make our own, then. Won't we? Food for all! Food for all! Food for all! Food for all! Food for all! Food for all! Food for all! Food for all! Food for all! Food for all... - Whoa. - Shit. When's the last time you had chocolate? When's the last time we could afford it?
