Do you have a cigarette? Yeah, I guess not. Excuse me. I'm really sorry. I thought we were alone up here. I'm sorry. I just had to, you know, use the facilities. Excuse me. Whoo-weee! There's a couple chicks down there. Naked as blue jays. Naked? Gorgeous, too. I mean, perfect bodies. Tall, full, firm. Just how I like 'em. Uh, Jen? Last one's for me. Shit. Ray, I mean, if we're out of beer, let's just split. Are you kidding me? I wanna see these girls. Women, not girls. Besides, I got another six-pack in the car. Why don't you go get it for us? Come on, Ray. I'm hungry. Let's just, um... Let's go get something to eat, okay? You're always hungry. What did I tell you about watching your figure, hmm? Why don't you get a nice little workout down the hill? There you go. That a girl. Ya! You know, fuck Phillip. You can do so much better than him. Christ. Lezzies. Man, that's fucking disgusting. Come on, Ray. You don't know they're lezzies, man. Maybe they're sisters. You ever kiss a girl like that, Jen? No, of course not. You ever touch a girl's hair the way she was doing before? Just come off it, Ray. You see? I told ya. They're fuckin' lesbians. Couple of daddy's girls, too. Brand-new jeans to go camping in, for Christ's sake. You know what we ought to do, Timmy? We ought to pop 'em. What? Pop 'em. You see, Jen, you don't get it. You never shot a rabbit before. Tim and I have, though. One minute everything is fine. Hey. We're hopping down the bunny trail. The next minute, pow! Rabbit hell, and you caused it. You took him there, and he ain't coming back. So, Jen, you gotta think like, "What would it feel like? What would it fucking feel like to shoot a person?" Lezzies? Who gives a fuck? They're not gonna have kids, right? Who's gonna miss 'em? You don't know they're lezzies. Not from just... you know, getting naked and stuff. Shut up, Tim. Maybe they're European. No. I heard about these European chicks, and they got this custom where they just get naked together. You are so fucking full of shit, Tim. You don't know, man. I just wish that I could completely just hate him, you know? But it's just that he really is so sorry afterwards. Oh, God. Come on, Lisa. He's already done this to you twice. Do you really think he's not gonna do it again? Yeah, I know. Ow. Gross. Man, we're gonna get eaten alive out here tonight. I packed bug spray. Even if he hadn't hit you, you know it wasn't gonna work out, right? Yeah, I guess. You guess? God, don't you remember Johnny Norman? He was exactly like this guy. I mean, he was cute and he was popular, but he was fucking full of himself you couldn't even stand him for two months. Yeah, you're right. I don't get it. Why do I always do this to myself? You're doing everything right. You're just not doing it with the right person yet. Come here. You're fine. We all make mistakes. It's okay. It doesn't mean that all guys are jerks. We just-- We gotta find the right ones, you know? Aah! Aah! Aah! Oh, God! Oh, God! Lisa, get up! Get up! Aah! Get up. What are we gonna do? We're gonna bury 'em, Tim. Then we're gonna pack up all their gear, and we're gonna dump it. So that way no one will ever know they were here. Does that sound like a plan to you? I want to get out of here! Bury them? What the fuck? You see any fucking shovels around here? Hey, Tim, you and Jennifer are gonna take the Buick, and you're gonna go back to my place, okay? Now, there's some shovels in the storage shed. Nobody's home, so don't worry, all right? Meanwhile, I'm gonna stay here, and I'm gonna tidy up, okay? Give me the flashlight. Cool. Now listen, here are the keys. This on is to the storage shed, all right? Remember to lock up when you're through. Timmy, do not go fucking up on me. I won't. I want-- I want Tim to drop me off at my house. No, you don't. You just think that you do, okay? Look at me. You're a part of this, okay? I want you to be a part of this. You are gonna remember tonight for fucking ever. Come here. Come here. Come here. Look at me. Come here. You will. I promise you you will, okay? Okay. Okay. Timmy. Come here. Okay. So... I want you guys to go now... and I want you to be careful, okay? Are you cool? Yeah, you are. Yeah, you are. All right. Do it. Drive safe. Come on, Jen. Take care of my girl. Charlie. What's going on there, big guy? What is it? Um... she died. Who? Elise Hanlon. Been on life support all these years. What was the point? Oh, hell, I'm sorry, Charlie. You know, I, uh-- I went to go see her, and, uh... it looked to me like she was already dead. There was nothing but skin and bones. She was a tough, tough kid. She wouldn't let go, you know? Or they wouldn't let her go. Can I get another one, Teddy? We worked hard on that case, Charlie. You know we did. Yeah, we did. Look where it went. Down the toilet. Absolutely true. My partner with it. Hey, you know, Teddy, he's got a great special here today. Corned beef sandwich, potatoes on the side. 5.25. I recommend it highly. Yeah? Christ, it's you. I heard about Elise, Mrs. Hanlon. You did? Yeah. I, uh... I thought I'd come by. I wanted to say I'm sorry. Who is that? It's a policeman. The Sparta police. Um, this is Detective Earl-- Charles. Charlie Shilling. Charlie Shilling. He, um-- He investigated the case. Look, um, it's awfully nice of you to come by. She died at 11:35 this morning. They called me and said she passed away. I guess I learned a little while after you did. I'm a little bit drunk here. Well, I... I figure you probably have a right to be. Yeah, but... the thing is... I'm a little bit drunk a lot of days now. I didn't used to be. I didn't drink very much, just a glass of wine, but now I do...with Eddie. I drink with my Eddie. I met Eddie at the... Where'd we meet? Um, we met over at the Standish House, over at the bar. Right, at the bar. You ought to finish that one and lay off. Ray's gonna be pissed. Ray couldn't care less. He'll care if you puke all over his boots. Ray doesn't care what I do, okay? He'll care if you puke. I'm not gonna puke. Have you thought about it yet? Huh? About what you want to do tonight. Me? I still say Don's, but...you know. It doesn't matter what I want to do... or what you want to do. It's what Ray wants to do. Yeah, sure. It's true. Bullshit. He always asks. Yeah, he asks. And then he just... does whatever he wants to do anyway. Shit. Whatever. Jennifer, come on! Jennifer, Jennifer, let's go. What? It's just Ray. You know the drill. It might not be Ray. It could be the man. Let's go. Come on. Jennifer! What? Stop, stop, stop! Come on! Let's go! No, no, no! Let's go! Come on! Okay! Get over here! Guys, I got held up at the fucking motel again. Ice machine's out, and the people in 11 are tossing themselves some party. A couple of babes, if you know what I mean. So I had to send Willie over to the 7/11 to get a bag. And you know he can't leave that fucking desk alone for a minute. You look good. I want you guys to meet someone. Please come with me. Tim and Jennifer, I want you both to meet Katherine. She just moved here from San Francisco. Her car had a flat back up on Laurel. I saw her hitching into town. And I figure we're going into town, why not just give you a lift, huh? Um... Tim thought maybe Don's Drive-in? No, we've been to the drive-in. The drive-in's for kids. Let's go downtown, hit the bars, party. She could use a drink, right? Whatever. Wait a minute, hold on. Hey, Etta. What's up? Your daddy says he wants to see you. Trouble? I don't think so. Why? You been in some? Where is he, outside? Out back. Hi, Daddy. You look dirty. Digging in the garden. I won't ask you for a hug. You got a minute? Sure, I guess. Thanks. Next weekend, I'm flying back to see your mom. You wanna come? No. You sure? Why would I want to do that? She's your mom, Kat. It would only be for the weekend. I thought we could see some friends, too. We could go see Deke. You don't like Deke. I don't have to like Deke anymore. He's there, we're here. Sorry, Dad. No way. You'll be all right, alone here? Sure. Etta will be around. Etta will be around during the days. It's the nights I'm worried about. Come on, Daddy. I'm a good girl. Bates Motel. Who? Oh, did I say Bates? I meant Starlight. Is this who I think it is? Do you always answer your phone that way? This is great! You called me! You're surprised? Uh, yes and no. What's yes and what's no? Oh, see, now you got me in a bit of a position here. How's that? Because anything that I say is gonna make me sound kind of egotistical. Which is to say you're not egotistical? Okay, let's just say... that I was hoping that you would call... because you wouldn't give me your number. You busy Friday night, Ray? I don't know. Let me check my schedule. Ahem. Let's see, um... I'll be damned. It's free. Pick me up at 8. Are you gonna tell me what you have in mind? I don't think so. Do me a favor. What's that? Make it a solo appearance. No little... groupies, please. You mean Tim and Jennifer? Mm-hmm. Okay. Who are Tim and Jennifer? Good. Who was that? Huh? I heard you talking. It was my goddamn mother! What else is new? Raymond, get over to 11 now. Why? What's the problem? Carla says the toilet's backed up. She says it's a hell of a mess all over the goddamn place. Great. Hurry up and get over there before it ruins the rug. Your mom again? Yeah. There's a big fucking emergency. Toilet duty. You want to go on over for me? Oh, yeah, sure. Swell. Like, my mother's a goddamn cripple. She can't do it herself. Oh, and do me a favor, Jen. Don't eat all the fuckin' Fritos on me. I'll take it from here. I'll have her call you once I'm through. Oh, Ray, meet Sally Richmond. Sally, this is my son Ray. He's my assistant manager. Sally's coming on in housekeeping tomorrow. It's nice to meet you, Sally. Hello, Mr. Pye. If you're gonna be on staff here, it's Ray, okay? Okay. Ray. 9:00, then? 9:00 sounds fine. We'll give you three days to start with and then see about extending you. Fine. Well, then, tomorrow. It was nice to meet you, Mrs. Pye. Same here. It was nice to meet you, Ray. Thank you. See you tomorrow. Everything fixed in 11? Yes, someone tried to flush a Kotex down the toilet. Some of these women are animals. Raymond-- It's all ready for Carla. So what time do you have to be at work tomorrow? 9. Sure wish I knew what you were planning to do and where you were planning to do it. I know it's your decision, but... I sure as hell would have tried to talk you out of it. Cut it out, Eddie. You're trying to spook me. You're damn right I am. It's just a job, Ed. I can handle it. Listen, the best way you can handle Ray Pye is to stay the hell away from him. I can do that, too. Good. What is he gonna do, murder me in the laundry room in broad daylight? You are a sweet, silly man, and you're crazy about me, aren't you? Hey, Sally, how's it going? Not bad. Not the most interesting job in the world, I guess. All the interesting jobs are usually taken. You got that right. Assistant manager's not exactly a thrill a minute either, but it pays the bills, though. Gets you out every now and then. Are you going to school? In the fall. Really? I figure I'd just hold onto the job for a year or so. Give myself a nice little nest egg, you know, and maybe try art school. Mm-hmm. What are you gonna major in? Um, photography, for starters anyway. You're a photographer? That's fantastic! Listen, every now and then, I jam with some friends, you know? We're in a band together, so we could use some photos for promotion and publicity. You think you might want to do that? Actually, I only do landscapes. So do a landscape! Only put me in the landscape-- Put the band in the landscape. It could be cool, right? I'll think about it, okay? Listen, there's a whole bunch of us going up to the point today after work. We drink a beer, just relax, and take a look at the sunset. Really terrific sunsets up there. You wanna come? I don't think so. Come on, you'll have fun. You're my boss, remember? So? There's gonna be a whole bunch of us up there. And besides, my mother's the boss. I'm just an employee just like you. You're the manager, Ray. I couldn't do that, but thank you for asking. You're welcome, Sally. Well, listen, think about the photos, okay? 'Cause we could really, honestly use them. Okay. Okay. Hey, Ray. Detective Shilling. Little slow today, huh? Hey, I'm wondering if maybe you could help me out with something here, Ray. Have you seen this guy before? No. Never. Why? Well, it's interesting, actually. He's wanted for a murder over in Mountain View. Seems he shot and, uh... killed two girls, campers... in the park overlooking the lake. That's why I say it's interesting because we had a murder a whole lot like that a few years back, up by Turner's Pool. You remember that, don't you? Of course I do. You and Detective Anderson questioned me about it a few times. A few times, yeah. Hey, do you think that maybe it was the same guy? I mean, the same guy who shot those two girls over here? Well, anything's possible, but, uh... no. We don't think it's the same guy that killed the girls over here. No, we think it's some other guy. Actually, we're pretty sure of it. So who else is on today besides you? Um, there's two girls on housekeeping. What about Mommy? No, she doesn't come in until tonight. You mind if I talk to this girls in housekeeping? Sure, no problem. Why don't you give me their names, Ray? Jeanie Robert-Shaw, uh, and-- You gotta slow down. It takes me a minute. Robert-Shaw? Robert-Shaw. Good actor. Remember Jaws? Remember that? ♪ Fare ye well and adieu Remember that? What's the second one's name? Uh...Sally Richmond. She's new, though. We'll just go with the new one first, what do you think? Tell me where I can find her. You want me to show you? It's no trouble. No, no, no, no, no, you just sit down. Sit down. All right. You have a good day, buddy. You know what? Your hair looks great. It looks killer. Sally Richmond? Yeah? Uh... I'm-- I'm, uh, Detective Charles Shilling. I'm, uh, a friend of Ed's. Oh. He's mentioned you often. This isn't about him, is it? Oh, no, no, no, no, he's fine, he's fine. He's a little bit worried about you, though. You mean about the job. You mean Ray. Yeah. Has he come on to you yet? Yesterday. My first day here. Can you believe that? Yeah, I can believe pretty much anything about Ray Pye. What else did Ed tell you about him exactly? Just that he was a suspect in a murder a few years ago. The main suspect. Come here, have a seat. Ray wasn't our main suspect. He was our only suspect. And now you're telling me that, you know, he's coming on to you, and it makes me think that maybe he came on to one of those girls back then and she said "Thanks, but no thanks," and that's why they're both of them dead right now. I need this job, Mr. Shilling. No, you don't. There's other jobs, Sally. Well, I understand what you're telling me and... I'm not a fool, so... I'll see what I can do. Good. You know Ed's 60, right? I know. So you like this place, too, huh? Man, I really love the food here. Sally, I'm glad I ran into you. I'm tossing a little party tonight. A whole bunch of people, and you ought to come. Really, you'll have a great time. I'm sorry. I've already got plans. Change 'em. Sorry, I can't. Are you sure? You'll have a wonderful time, I promise. As I said, I've got plans. Well, that's too bad. Maybe some other time, then. Hey, Ray. Hey, Dee Dee. Good to see you. What can I get you? How about a Coke and a burger, medium? You want fries with that? No, you better hold the fries, Dee Dee, 'cause I gotta watch my figure. Come on, Ray, not you. Is there anything else I can get you? Actually, no, I'm all finished. Here. You can keep the change. Thanks. Have a good rest of the day. Have you ever seen this? Adams is the best. I look at these photos all the time. It helps me relax and forget about things. This book is brand-new, Ray. Yeah. Well, my old copy fell apart. You're full of shit. What? Bye. Let go of me, Ray! What the hell is wrong with you? Who do you think you are, huh? No! Look at me! Who do you think you are, Ray? You come on to me my first day on the job, and I make it perfectly clear that I'm not interested, and then you come to me now with some stupid line about a book you don't even know about? I don't like being insulted in public. Tell your mom I'm not coming back after lunch. Tell he that I quit. If you do not get out of my car right now, I will scream, I swear. You're a bitch, Sally-- Fuck you! Let go! Yeah, hey, Charlie? Sally just called me. Yeah. Yeah. She told me she quit her job. She did? Good. Good. Good for her. She told me that you convinced her to do it, and I'm just thanking you for putting the fear of God into her. My pleasure. Oh, and another thing. She told me that Pye invited her to party he was throwing tonight. He's a persistent little bastard, isn't he? Well, I got thinking that, you know, probably hangs around with a pretty young crowd. There might be some minors there. Might be some drugs there. I know how you hate to corrupt the minors, Charlie. I hate it worse than taxes, Ed. Thanks for the tip, partner. Six girls. What? I have fucked six girls in this place, and still they've been coming around. It sounds like someone is having quite a party here. Yes, and I just can't get to sleep. I have-- I have my meetings first thing in the morning, and I really need my sleep. Perhaps if you could send s patrolman over-- Hey, Dee Dee, welcome to the party. Hey, Ray. Do you want to be lucky number seven? What? Cops! Oka, uh, fuck! If you have a roach, please swallow it. Beers-- Fuck! Beers in the fridge! Timmy, open the door, please! Ashtrays in the toilet, now! Oh, shit. Whoa, whoa. Damn! Christ! I burned myself. Hey, Charlie. I was just cruising around the neighborhood. Thought maybe I'd lend a hand, huh? Let's go. Shit! Dick, it's smoke! Drop it! Guys, guys, guys, guys! Not on the fucking floor! God damn it! This is a fucking mess! Go on! Get out of here! Go! Go! Leave your fucking joint! Get out! Fuck! Excuse me, son. We've had a noise complaint. Is this your place? No, man, it belongs to a friend. Well, may I speak to your friend, then, please? Actually, he's in the john. He's in the john? Yeah. Well, then will you get him for me, please? Sure. Officers, is there some problem? Hey, Ray. You mind if we all come in and hang out for a moment? I guess you have a warrant. Why would we have a warrant for a simple noise complaint, Ray? No, we just want to come in and have a chat like you and I did yesterday. The guy who killed those two young girls. What? The guy that looked a lot like you. Uh, listen, Officer, we're just having a little party here, and we'll turn down the volume, okay? I apologize personally if we disturbed anyone. You smell something funny, guys? I kinda do, now that you mention it. You smoking weed, Ray? Nope. What you smell must be cigarettes. Oh. My buddy here? Great cook. He burned a pan on the stove making popcorn. Oh, making popcorn? Yeah. Burnt pan? That's right. All right, you guys, the party's over. You know, I don't think you can do that. Sure I can, Ray. You know, I'm looking around here and probably three-quarters of these kids are minors. From right here, I can see empty cans, bottles, beer. make them walk the line? I mean, it might take a while, but we got plenty of time, right, guys? Stretch out your hand, touch the tip of your nose, all that, sure. Jesus Christ! What did you say, Ray? Nothing. You religious? Jesus? You know the way that you said that could be construed as a curse word. Are you using curse words in the presence of officers of the law, Ray? No, not at all. Okay, well, uh, you heard the man. The party's over. Okay, Miss, let's go. Well, I'm staying here. Your mom and dad know that? I'm 20 years old. Could I see some I.D.? Um... Okay. Sorry to have troubled you, Miss Fitch. Hey, Ray. Buddy. I will definitely see you around. All right, killer. Good night. Uhh! Aah! Aah! Ray? Ray? Look, I-- I know how you feel, I really do. And it was-- it was a great party, too, until they came along. Look, just...just... just talk to me, okay? Okay? And then... And then maybe, in a while, we'll clean up the place, all right? And then... and then we'll plan an even bigger party, okay? Just--I mean, maybe for the weekend, okay? That'll show 'em. Won't it? Won't it? Did you think it was a really great party? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I did. Everybody did. Yeah? What were you doing standing by the window, fucking sulking with Timmy, then? Oh. Um, I was-- I was just a little tired. That's bullshit! Okay, I just-- I just... Ray, I just got depressed, okay? That's all. You know, it's like all those other girls were here, okay? And that Dee Dee, you know? Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's-- It's just that you know how I feel about us, right? I just got a little depressed, that's all. I couldn't help it, okay? And I know it's dumb because-- because I love you, and I know that you love me back, okay? Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Take off your blouse. I wanna see your tits. Jen, take off your blouse. I want to see your tits. Come on! Undo me. You want them all the way off? Did I say I wanted them all the way off? You know what? Fuck it. Just forget it. Just get the hell-- Just get out of here. Ray... Just-- You know what? Just fuck it. Get your stuff and go home. Fuck. Ray, come on. This-- It happens. It doesn't happen to me! No, it doesn't! Look, I've got an idea. Why don't you just let me help you clean up the place? And then maybe in a little while, we'll just take another shot at it. No! No, all right? No, Jen, no. We will not take another fucking shot at it! Okay. Do you hear me, Jen? Do you fucking hear me? Ray, you're hurting me. It would be really smart of you to go right now. Get the fuck out of here! Okay, bye. Anything wrong? No. You know me, in one mood and out the other. So you think we could, um... think we could do that again? Well, jeez, Timmy, is it okay if I finish my smoke first? No, I mean, um... you think we could do it again some-- some other time? I don't know. Maybe. I mean... I just... had to see. You know, I just... I just needed to see... something, I don't know. Sure. You got any dope on you, Tim? Yeah. Try some of this. Cool. Where'd you get hash? Ray. You don't usually buy. I didn't. Ray gave it to you? He never gives up hash. I mail it for him, right? I pick it up at the post office. I've been shaving it for about a year now. Ray's never noticed it. Jesus, Timmy. You got more balls than brains, you know that? Ray would kill you if he knew. I know. Let's fire it up. It looks just the same. You know Short Hills? We lived here when I was a kid. Can't say I've missed it. Take the next right. Where are we going? You'll see. Kath, what the hell are we doing here? We're here for drinks, silly. See that oak tree over there? My mom once shattered a glass of banana daiquiri all over it. What did she do that for? I guess she didn't like her drink. How are you two this evening? Doing fine. What would you like to drink? I'll take a scotch and soda. Banana daiquiri. Thank you. Ahem. Do you want to play a little game? What kind of game? It's called Truth. I ask you a question. You have to answer it completely and truthfully, no bullshit. Then you can ask me a question. I'll run a tab for you? Please do. So what do you think? Okay. I'll give it a shot. Do you wear make-up? Oh! Yeah. Sometimes. But you know, when you play in a band, you gotta know about things like hair color and make-up. I mean, it's just part about being serious about what you do. I don't overdo it, and most people never even notice. It's my turn, right? Mm-hmm. What do you really think about me? First of all, um, I hardly know you. You're funny. Yeah. Quirky in a way I kinda like. Good-looking. Conceited. Conceited? Okay, in this game, you're not allowed to interrupt. Okay. And you hang around with a bunch of losers. But then again, you know... Sparta's 90% losers from what I can see. You have secrets. You talk a lot, but don't say much. I find that kinda interesting. Is that all? Yeah, yeah, for now. It's my turn. Are you actually fucking Jennifer? No. No? Absolutely not. Never? That's another question. So now it would be my turn again, right? Sure. Are you attracted to me? You see? I told you you were conceited. Those two questions were both about you. No, they're not. I was just trying to see how you see me is all, you know, like your own personal perception. That's different, right? Okay, yeah. I find you attractive. That doesn't necessarily mean I'm gonna do anything about it. But yes. In a strange sort of way, yeah, I do. What's the worst thing you've ever done? I, uh... Uh... I trashed a house once. I was 17. Timmy and I both ran away from home. It just seemed like a cool idea. Just run away. Just get the hell out of there, you know? Timmy knew this place up on Stir Fire Road where his dad had done some work as a carpenter. It was way the hell out in the boonies. The owners only use it in the summertime. And here it was winter, so the two of us broke in there. I mean, all they had to eat was SpaghettiOs, but the liquor cabinet was full, and we found a case of beer in the basement. I found a .38 Lady Smith revolver in the nightstand and a .22 rifle under the bed. We started target practicing inside the house. Too fucking crazy, 'cause whether you hit anything or not, you had to, like, dodge the ricochets. It was fucking flying around after you. It was probably pretty stupid of me. We could have gotten ourselves killed. But... man, it was a kick. We were stoned, so we didn't care. I even trashed the TV. I really did, I trashed that thing. So one morning, we wake up. I mean, this place is a total disaster. There's hardly a stick of furniture left. We're sick of SpaghettiOs. We have no more liquor. We're out of pot. We're bored shitless, so we said "Fuck it," and we got out of there. What's the worst thing you've ever done? Um... that would be... lying to my mother. Lying to your mother? Yeah. That's the worst thing you've ever done? One lie in particular. The complete and total truth, right? Yeah. My mom was diagnosed a paranoid schizophrenic a couple of years ago, and she went from being this terrific painter of Abstractionist-- She even had shows in New York-- She went from there to thinking that the entire art world was out to get her. Not just the art world, but the cops, too. One Saturday afternoon, my mom's in one of her rages. and she's off her medication again. It was a nice day, and she was digging up violets and begonias, insisting I help and yelling at me to "go and get a shovel, God damn it, because there's somebody buried in there." Finally, I was just so sick of all this crazy bullshit. So I told the lie. I told her that my dad had come into the room the night before and said that he was leaving her and moving now. "So fuck her and her bodies buried in the garden. She can just go dig them up herself." It was kind of the last straw... not being able to trust my father. So this one night, my mom snuck into the kitchen. She turned the grill on high, waited until it was really hot. Aah! The idea was that she was trying to burn away her fingerprints. She wouldn't let my dad touch her, just me, but I didn't know how the fuck to deal with burns that bad. She never painted again after that. Damn. Let's get out of here. Good night, Ray. Hey, tomorrow night? Okay. One condition. What? You pick what we do this time... and you make it interesting. I can do that. Hey, Bobby, how you been? Can I, um, get a large box of condoms? Hey! Ed! How have you been? I haven't seen you in a while. I've been pretty good, Bill. I just got a summer cold, you know? It's hard to get rid of. You, too? Otherwise, it's, you know... everything's okay. Yeah, Sally's got a cold. I hope I don't catch the goddamn thing. You remember Sally? Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, they sure do grow up fast, don't they? You wanna play mini golf? Nah. So... do you want to split? Sure. Where to? You'll see. What, we're going camping? Nah. Swimming. There's a great pool up there, you'll see. You want to swim? Sure! It's not too cold. No swimsuits, Ray. You always wear a swimsuit? Leeches? It's possible. Does that bother you? Not unless it bothers you. I mean, the thought of a leech on your dick-- My dick's gonna have to take its chances. Fuck, it's freezing. Shit, that ought to keep the leeches down. Enough with the leeches, Ray. 20 bucks says that you don't have the guts to go in first and face all those nasty leeches by yourself. I mean, who knows? Maybe... there may be even, like, a snake or two. I thought this was your idea to go in the pool. I'm going to be right in after you. You wanna watch me get naked, right? Me? Yeah. No interest at all. Make it a hundred. You can even hold the flashlight. How's that for a deal? Go ahead, Ray. Move the flashlight around a little. Because you won't face it at home, right? You know, this isn't my style, Ray. Why don't you just fuck me instead? What? Just fuck me. Are you serious? Are you-- Are you fucking with me? Sorry. For what? That was a little fast. I've had faster. You know, I should never have brought you down here. Why's that? You remember last night? When you asked me what the worst thing I ever did was? I told you about trashing that house? Mm-hmm. It was a lie. The trashing the house? No, we trashed the house. But that's not the worst thing I ever did. I don't know what to say to you, Ray. I don't know whether to believe you, either. It's pretty fucked up, though, you know, either way. I'm pretty fucked up. I've been fucked up for a while. So you didn't tell me. What did it feel like? I did tell you. No. Tell me what it felt like after. Not then. At the time, not when you were out there killing people. Jesus. Do you, uh... do you really want to hear this? I guess I must. I'm asking, huh? Okay. Uh... It felt scary. It felt dangerous, and it felt scary. But I gotta tell you. I gotta be honest with you. It also felt like I had all this this power all of a sudden. Like I could scare them or, uh... or wound them or whatever. Uh... Like, even when I started shooting, I could stop and let them live, or I could just keep doing what I was doing. It's also like I was on this fucking roller coaster and, uh, I... I don't know, I mean, it just, like, grabs a hold of you. Wow. Uh... That's pretty fucked up. Um...I'm sorry. I apologize. Don't get it. I'm sorry. Do you know what time it is? It's probably a wrong number. It's not the wrong number, Ray, not at this hour. Hello? All right. I'll be on the first plane in the morning. Is the body wrapped? Do you know how much she suffered? So did I. All right. I really did love her. I love you. I love you so much, Daddy. I'll see you. Okay. Bye. Your mother? Jesus, I'm really sorry. I think you should go now, Ray. I-- I have things to do. I have to go to San Francisco first thing in the morning. Okay, sure. Yeah. Um... I'm really sorry, Katherine. I'm here for you, Kath. It's all right. Good-bye. I don't know. I'm feeling, like, I guess you could say exposed. Everywhere I go, I feel like people are staring at me. "There goes that dirty old man." You're not a dirty old man. So how come I feel like one? Ed, I don't care who knows about us. Is that why you're parked out back so the neighbors can't see? Christ, Sally, I'm old enough to be your grandfather. No, you're not. You're a few years older than my dad. I don't see why that's such a big deal. Well, the town would. Your parents would. So you're gonna get drunk on me now? You got a reputation to think about. My reputation? In a month, I'm leaving it in its tracks. Yeah, and I gotta still live in this town after you're gone. What are you telling me? Don't fuck around with me, Ed. I just don't feel like the way I did. I just think that-- I was wondering maybe I don't... Maybe we shouldn't be doing this and... maybe I shouldn't be doing this. So you want to call it quits? Jesus, Ed. Listen, Sally, you're so young. Don't say that to me! It's not my reputation that you're worried about. It's your reputation, and you're putting that in front of us. I never took you as coward, Ed. Oh! Close your eyes. Why? Close your eyes. You'll see. Oh, my God. Ray. It's so beautiful. It's a diamond. A diamond? Oh, my God, Ray. I picked it out just for you. Listen, I know that I don't always show it, but you will always be number one with me, Jen, okay? Oh, my God, Ray. I love you so much. I'm sorry. I know I haven't been good enough to you lately, acting jealous and all that. How much? 30 bucks. For how much blow? Well, if you beg, bop until you drop. We got 4 grams left, and I figure "Hmm... half of a gram ought to just sock it to you lightly." Settle down, Ray. You've already done three, like, the other night. I'm cool as ice. You were in jail, huh, man? Yeah. What was that like? See, the thing is... I don't like to talk about it. Is that okay with you... Ray? Hey, whatever. Yeah. I sure as shit do hope so. Why the fuck do you walk like that, Ray? No shit, man. I was only a kid, like, 12 years old, and this weed deal, this weed deal goes bad. I mean, real fucking bad. And these crazy motherfuckers, I mean, these guys in these fucking suits, these Mafia types, right? They shoot me in both my legs. Pow! But I still had to get away, right? I told you this fucking story. I still had to get away. I had to run, like, 3 miles home. By the time I got home, my legs were fucked. Well, they took the bullets out, but that shit still hurts, man. It also depends on the weather. Hey, Rog, how much would you take for a gram of this shit? 60? You think you can go 80? Roger, I think I can go 80. You got a problem? What? Do you have a problem? No. Okay, cool. Yeah? Tim, come on out. There's someone here to see you. Just a second. No problem, right? No, no problems, just like I said. You want a beer? No, thanks. How are you, Tim? Okay. Yeah? You working for your dad? Yeah. Sometimes when he needs a hand. Lenny, can I ask you a big favor? Sure. Could I have a couple minutes alone with Tim? Well, I don't know, Charlie. What's this about? Just trust me. I think he'd, uh, be a little more comfortable to open up to me when his dad's not sitting here. You sure he's not in any trouble? 'Cause if he is-- No, no, he's not. This is about somebody-- somebody else. Ray Pye. Lenny, can we please have a couple of minutes? Really important. So you're sleeping with Jennifer, aren't you? That's none of your business. That about answers that question. So then the next question is... how's Ray taking it? I mean, does he know about you two? Look, Mr. Shilling-- It's Detective Shilling. You see, Tim, I know that he killed those girls. I know it. Now, what worries me, and worries me bad, is what does a guy like that do when he finds out that he's been betrayed, hmm? What if somebody told him? Four years ago, my partner Ed Anderson interviewed you in connection with Ray Pye and his possible involvement in the shootings of Elise Hanlon and Lisa Steiner. And at that time, I think you said Ray was friend of yours, but you didn't know him all that well. You remember any of this? Uh, yeah, a little bit. It was-- It was a long time ago. You also said that you were home alone that night watching TV. Yeah. Yeah, that I remember. Why? Huh? Why do you remember that? I don't know, I just do. Oh. Okay. Well, let's say you do and you were. Why did you lie about the other thing? What-- What other thing? That you were already sleeping with Ray. I was not. Why, sure you were. No, that's ridiculous. Well, Tim Best doesn't think it's ridiculous. And he said you were. No. No, that's not true. Tim wouldn't say that. He also says that you're sleeping with him now. Jesus! I slept with Tim once. Well, once counts, doesn't it? The thing is, Jennifer, Tim told me that you were sleeping with him. I mean, why would he lie about you and Ray? It doesn't really make him look too good, doesn't it? Sharing you with his best buddy? Jennifer, look, I know all about this Ray Pye, this piece of shit. This is my card. If you think about this, call me. Wow. That's a nice crystal. Ray give you that? It's... It's a diamond. No, sweetie, it's not a diamond. No, that's an Austrian crystal. You know, if you hit that with a hammer, it'll shatter. Probably shouldn't, though. Kinda pretty, even though it's not really a diamond. My name is Ray Pye, Mr. Wallace. I'm a friend of Katherine's. Uh... I'm sorry for your loss, sir. Thanks. Is-- Is Kath-- Is she available? I just wanted to give her my condolences. Certainly. Come inside. Thank you. Someone's here to see you, Kath. Hi, Kath. Hi. What are you doing here? We just got back a half an hour ago. Come on. Come outside with me. I bought these for you. Thanks. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I really missed you. Man, you don't-- you don't even know how much I did. Why didn't you call me? I couldn't call you, Ray. Why not? A phone call? Look, Ray, we'll talk, okay? I'll call you tomorrow once we're settled in. Christ, Kath, I mean, like, tomorrow? It's been going on for, like a whole week? Tomorrow? I'll call you tonight. Hello. Hey. Kath. Great. How you doing? I'm fine. How's your dad? He's okay. I made some dinner. We watched some television. Fairly normal evening. Well, he'll be okay. It just takes time. I've got a little present for you. I think you'll like it. I thought maybe you could come over, we could hang out-- I can't do this anymore. Huh? I mean, I like you, and we had a good time together. I just don't think we should keep on seeing each other. Jesus Christ, Kath, I love you. Look at it my way. I'm heading into my senior year in a brand-new school in a brand-new town, and I wanna be able to-- Fuck other guys? Excuse me? You wanna be able to fuck other guys? It that, like, all the fuck you're saying? It's not all the fuck I'm saying, Ray. You're just hearing what you want to hear, you know that? Is it college? Daddy's got, like, all this money and his great job, and you're going off to school? Like that fucking cunt Sally Richmond! "Ray's a fucking loser!" I don't know what you're talking about, Ray. Fuck! I don't want to get involved, that's all. No more, no less. Fuck! I figure you owe me the truth. I figure you owe me at least that much. You fucked some guy in 'Frisco? That's it. Discussion over. I'm going to bed now, Ray. You can't hang up on me right now, not in the middle of all this. I'm not in the middle of anything. I've said everything I've had to say. Just fucking listen to me, all right? I'm going to bed. Good night, Ray. Good-bye. What the fuck, Jen? What the fuck? That's exactly right! I came here to tell you I quit. No more bullshit, Ray. What the fuck are you talking about? You have fucked with my head for the last time, okay? I am gone, do you get me? I'm Tim's girl now, you fucking asshole! And he is better in bed than you'll ever be! And he doesn't have to stuff his shoes with beer cans to make people think he's got a big cock, okay? So screw you! And screw your goddamn phony ring, fucker! You fucking bitch! Raymond! Let her go, Raymond. Right now! Uugghh! Hey, Ray. What's going on? Weigh it. What? Weigh it. I already did. Do it again. Short. You've been shaving it on me, Timmy. I-- I fucking figured! I had a real strange visit this morning, Timmy. I mean strange, man. From who? Jennifer. You see this little scratch right here? Yeah? She threw my fucking ring at me. Said that you were screwing her, and she threw my ring right in my face. If my mom wasn't there, I would have fucking killed that little cunt right there in the goddamn fucking driveway! I'd have fucking killed her flat, flabby ass. You know what I'm saying? I've fucking had it with every one of these fucking cunts! Hi, Ed. Hey. I was just gonna call you. What were you gonna say to me? You called me, remember? Let's hear it, Ed. I was just gonna say I'm sorry. That's it? Okay, that and that... I'd like to spend... whatever time you have here, I'd like to spend it with you. And that... and that I miss you. And, uh... that I don't give a damn what other people are saying. Gee, Ed, that's a lot. I was just gonna say that... I forgive you. Hey! That's great! That's plenty! Now I've got more good news. Tony got me a cushy babysitting job, and I start tomorrow. Well, that's great. Why don't we celebrate? I'll make us dinner. No, you won't make us dinner. You'll take us down to Mountain View for a couple of steaks. But not tonight 'cause I'm taking Tony out for a burger and a movie. Tomorrow? Um, all right. 7:30? That sounds just perfect. Okay. Bye, Ed. I'll see you then. Aah! Aah! Aah! Don't you fucking move! Get the fuck in! Shoe! All right, then. We'll lock all the doors. Aah! Oh! Aah! Come on, Jen. Come on, Jen. Come on. Boo. You stay in there, you hear? Get in, Jen. Fuck! You guys don't know each other, do you? Hello! Sally, Jennifer. Jennifer, Sally. Now get in the car, Jen, before I... kill your fucking ass in front of the neighbors. I'm gonna talk to you guys in a little bit, okay? Be strong. Be strong. Gotcha! Hey! Daddy! Daddy! What's wrong with you? Our daughter's been kidnapped. You sitting around here doing nothing? Why aren't you doing anything about it? You! You son of a bitch! I knew damn well it was you! I care for her very much, and I'm very worried. You goddamn lecher! You're disgusting! I ought to have your ass thrown in jail! Easy! She's age of consent. Come on. So that makes it okay? You know what I'm saying. This son of a bitch dares to come around here? Come around here now? Throwing it right in my goddamn face! You heard him. He cares what happens to her. So do I. What? What are you telling me, Charlie? Are you fucking her, too? Slide over, you're driving. The fuck I am! Oh, you're gonna have a hell of a lump on your head in the morning, Kath. Would you like another one? That a girl. Where to, Ray? Back to the campground so you can dump the body? What body? My body. No campgrounds. You'll see when we get there. Just drive the car. We didn't do anything. Ray just went crazy. He shot those two girls. And then-- And then afterwards-- We couldn't tell anybody-- Listen to me. Where would Ray take Jennifer? Where would he take Jen and Sally now? Where would he go? His apartment? No, we've got a car there since the shooting started. Nobody's shown up. Where would he go? Jesus! Fuck! Not on my fucking boots! Get the fuck out of there! God! Do you remember our date, Kath? At that stupid fucking country club? Where you told me about your sick fuck of a mother, and I told you about the worst thing I ever did? Well, guess what. This is where it all happened. Right the fuck up there. That's where... That's where I got my firepower. Scene of the crime, babe. Scene of the fucking crime. Oh, God, I'm tired. Okay, now, I only got one pair. And I figure Kat's gonna be the one that wants to give me the most trouble. So, um, why don't you... do the honors for me like a good girl? These ones on her. To-fucking-day! Right now! Well? Fucking do it! Aah! Put the fucking cuffs on her, Sally! Oh, you wanna snap at me? You wanna fucking snap at me? She's gonna put 'em on! Um, no. You ever see a cop cuff somebody that way in the movies, huh? Have you got shit for brains? Huh? Have you? You cuff the hands behind the back, not in front of the back. Jesus Christ! You see somebody do it that way in the movies, you now you got one fucked-up movie, you know? You just wasted your 8 bucks. The guy's gonna bust-- handcuffs, no cuffs. Ha ha ha! They must come up to the lake this fucking time of year. Need these bugs around the apartment, know what I mean? We should make out. I'm sorry. No, no, no, no, it's not your fault. You're Katherine, right? I'm Sally. You're so beautiful. Your hair is so pretty. This is fucking touching! I'm having a great time! But really, I'd like to go up there. So whenever you're both fucking ready, let's fucking go. Come on. Oh, that's you, too. Here we go. Don't fuck with me right now! God damn it! What the fuck? What the fucking shit! This is my fucking place! Guess who's pissed. Go! Go in the fucking corner! Aah! Who the fuck are you? No! Don't you fucking move, man! Who the hell are you? My father sold the house. There are movers coming tomorrow, and we're-- Packing things up. I'm sorry, what was that? We're packing things up! Aah! Stay fucking right there! What are your names? Ken. Ken. Ken Wellman. This is my wife-- Don't tell me-- Aah! Is it Barbie? Is that your fucking name? Her name's Elizabeth. Liz. Don't you fucking come near me, man! Really? Well, that's just fucking great. I hope everyone's having a fucking great time! Wow. You got movers coming in tomorrow? Yes. What time? 8:00. Listen, I don't know what you want here, but for God's sake-- For God's sake fucking what? Listen, you be cool, okay? You be fucking cool, my man. You just do as you're told, you'll be okay. My business is with the girls. This is my fucking business, Kenny! These are all my girls. Don't you fucking-- Aah! Don't fucking move! Where's the fucking plug? Don't fucking move! I can see you, you know what I mean? I can see what you're fucking doing! Right? Whoo! Get the fuck over there and fucking stay there! Okay. Kenny... your old lady. She's pregnant, man, isn't she? That's cool. Good for you, man! Good for you. You know why guys like pregnant women? A wife and kids? I thought about it. It's easy. It's because a guy looks at a pregnant woman and wants a little kid, he knows they can be fucked! You know what I mean? So they can be fucked! I mean, someone's fucking them. You know what I'm saying? How far along are you? Three months. I bet you folks want a boy, right? We don't care. either way. Either way, you're happy, right? Why don't you guys give me a hand? You're all silent. That's what I need. See, I want you to give me a hand with the girls. I got some serious talking to do to them. I want them to pay close fucking attention. Like you right now. Like you fucking right now! Pay the fuck attention! Think you can give me a hand, Kenny? What do you say? You're a pal, Kenny. What do you say? Uh, you know... Did you know that Sharon Tate was pregnant, Kenny? You know Sharon Tate, the movie actress, got herself gutted by the fucking Manson family. Amazing, terrific piece of ass. The fucking best! I think she's further along, Liz, though. I don't even remember. Does it matter? She's dead. She's fucking dead. Kenny, I can't afford-- I'm losing my fucking patience, Kenny! What do you say? All right. I'll do what you want. Lizzie? All right. All right? Yes! The other two, maybe, you could maybe see it coming, but Jennifer... He's been with Jennifer forever. Listen, kid, where else would he go? There's this drummer Roger, but see, Roger's deep into drugs and... You know, I-- I... I can't see him risking having Ray there and-- and guns. The only other guy I can think of, the only other one, is Sammy Nardoni. He's the one that gives us the hash. Okay. You know these people's addresses? I don't know them exactly, but I have them written down at home. Get on that phone, call Mommy and Daddy at home, and get me those addresses. Lieutenant Anderson and I are going outside for a minute. We'll be right back. Lieutenant Anderson? It's a force of habit. Sorry. And I like their names. Gus is right. Who's gonna let this kid into the house with three scared girls held at gunpoint? Gotta be nuts. Unless that Nardoni character's some kind of real hard case. Maybe then. Mm-hmm. If he's still cruising around in that Buick, we'll get him. Yeah. Question is when? I think I know. I think I know where he might take 'em. Okay, her next. Lizzie, Lezzie, Elizabeth. Her next! Get your fucking cunt-ass over here! I'm not gonna fucking tell you again! You wife, man, look how fucking jittery she is! I mean, she looks as if she can run out and just, like, fucking bolt on me any minute. I won't run, I promise. You do? You fucking promise? Do you fucking promise? Get your fucking ass over here! Whenever you're fucking ready! Why not her? Why me? Uh, well, you know, I kinda got something planned for Sally, Lizzie, and to be honest with you, I don't think you'd like it. You should probably just have a seat, Lizzie. I mean, I'm not gonna hurt you or anything. Shut the fuck up! Oh! Kenneth? You're not gonna get all mousy on me, are you, cowboy? Move on, you piece of shit. You know what? I'll be honest with you, brother. I don't really like you anyway. Aah! Aah! Oh! Yeah! Aah! Aah! No! Please! No! Aah! Aah! Just like Sharon. Uhh! Aah! Bitch! Aah! Uhh! You fucked me up, you know that? I mean you really did. Fuck! This fucking hurts! Man, do I have taste in women. I just knew you'd be something. From the moment I saw you, I knew. I just knew you'd be something else. Uugghh! Just like Kath over there. I ain't seen you naked yet, though! Only one of my girls I haven't. I'm not one of your girls, Ray. You are now, you fucking cunt! Take off the fucking blouse! Come on, you got your girlfriend's brains all over it! Take that fucking shit off! You-- What? Huh? You don't need the gun, Ray. Oh, you're gonna cooperate now? Yeah. You are? I'll do what you want me to. You will? Uh-huh. You gonna show me your titties? If you want. Gonna show me your snatch? What? "I'm gonna show Ray my snatch." Say it. I'm gonna show Ray my snatch. Uggh! "I'm gonna show Ray my titties" Say it. I'm gonna show Ray my titties. That's good. I haven't fucked you yet, either, have I? What the fuck is she still alive for? I just fucking shot her! We'll get to that later. You were saying? I don't remember! I don't remember! I'm sorry! Are you a good fuck or a bad fuck? I'm a good fuck. Yeah. Who says so? My boyfriend. You got a boyfriend? Who's your fucking boyfriend? What's his name? Ed. Like as in Mr. Ed? Is he hung like a horse or something, huh? You know, the horse! I don't-- I don't know what you're talking about. Take off your fucking blouse or I will put you down like they put a horse down! Like I put my fucking mama down, cunt! I ain't got all fucking night. Come on. Let's go. Take off your fucking shirt! Okay. Oh. Wow. Not bad. Pretty nice, in fact. Yeah. No! Look at me. Uhh! Fuck! Sally! Duck! Uhh! Uhh! Aah! Aah!
