I was just wondering, um, have you heard from Mum? She's just busy. But she can. I don't understand, what you're trying to say. Not every woman is cut out for motherhood. Well, I think Mum's doing a great job, to be honest. Alright, Grandma, I need to go. The money on the card's nearly finished. Okay, dear, well, tell your mother to call me. Yeah, I will, I will. For all she knows, I'm lying in the gutter. Alright. Bye, Grandma, bye. But Mama, I want to do it tonight. I'm sad. Go and brush it. And by the way, I'm dead. Now, go and brush it now! I said now. Rocks, why is your house such a mess? It's not. What are you, a vampire? Cut it. - Cut it, it's too early. - Cut it. bro, look how dark it is in here, Rocks! So, why are you not dressed? - I've gotta look after Emmanuel. - We can bring him, I'll look after him. - He's not coming. - Why not? - Because he's not coming. - Why not? Because I'm not. Mashallah. Mashallah, lead the way. You're such an idiot. I went mosque with this. Air Forces is a perfect touch. Shut up, man. Go get changed. - Cool, cool, cool, bro. - Get Emmanuel ready. What are you doing? You're so weird. - Come on, man. - Not gonna lie - my back is burning, man. - Hey, Emmanuel! Look at him! - It fizzes. - Watch when it pops in your mouth. Look at his reaction. - Is it gonna hurt? - No. I don't like it! Ah! Swallow it so it finishes. Finish it, swallow it. Yeah, there, it's gone. Okay? Welcome to the future. Rocks, can you do my eyebrows? Or like, or just do my make-up? Sorry, Agnes. I don't really have stuff for your colour, cause I never get white clients. I was on the bus, yeah, and some guy was bare looking at me, like... I was fixing my scarf and some guy was looking at me like he was gonna say something... Sis, the TV's not working. - Let me see. - Come and see. Try turning it on with the remote. I did it, it's not working. Damn. Everything is not working in this home. Ugh... Yeah, the electricity's finished. Aww... Have you seen the brown envelope I had? Er, no. I can't even remember taking it out. There's nothing under here. Only breadcrumbs. It's just... it's just me and you. Hyah! Hyah! Turn on! Turn on, turn on! How to get rich... Maybe I could do a charity run? A sponsored walk? Oh, just shut up and look for the money. - No. - Just look for it. No. Never. Playing with your stupid toys. Hmm. Matchamai, Matchamai. Matchamai. Hi, it's Funke. I'm not here right now so if you'd like to leave a message... Okay, welcome back, everybody. I hope you enjoyed... Quieten down, please. We'll just check that you're on the ball. We'll do the easy one where I write the equation out for you. Does anybody want to impress me? We'll skip all... Okay, somebody's phone. So, I can hear it. Hello, who's this? - Hello? - Is that you, Shola? - Hello? - Hello? - No, she isn't, sir. - Who's this? - Agnes, I'm not talking to you. - Wait, I can't hear you. Shola, could you get off your phone, please? - Is that Mrs. Omotoso? - Is this about my mum? Excuse me. Excuse me, could you get off your phone, please? Look, sorry, I can't hear you. Can you speak louder, please? You are stopping the whole learning process. - This is a top-set maths class. - I'd like to ask you some questions. - You're disturbing the lesson. - What questions? If you don't give me your phone I'm gonna have to put you in isolation. Your phone number's been chosen to be included in a study. I asked her three times. I'm gonna have to send you out. - I thought... - I turned it off, man. - It's off. - I don't care. You're going. Miss Judge? Yeah, could you come and get Shola, please? It's not that deep, sir. It's nothing to do with you, Agnes. If you wanna join her in isolation - I suggest... - Where's the C1, C2, C3, C4? You want me to take that perfect badge off you? - No, I haven't done anything... - You're perfect. You're just on your period, sir. That's why you're angry. D'you know what, that's offensive - whether you're talking to anybody. - How is that offensive? The fact that you're talking to a male teacher... - Let me see yours. - It's not that bad. Remember the girl from Nottingham? The new girl? She speaks bare weird. - You know she says "bum" for nice. - She says "bruh." - She says bum? - Like bum, for nice. I heard she got kicked out of her last school. So, why didn't you reply to my text on Sunday? I had a mad headache. What's happening with the wedding? Nothing much. Just bare people in the house. See? Sumaya said it's perfect. That's why she's the malawah. - Queen. - Fam, didn't even knock! - No respect. - Roshe, you're late. - My bad. - Add some milk. Right. Come on, put this on, and join a group. Come on. You have to sieve it. - Hi. - Hi. Let me, let me... So, can you make malawah? I don't know what that is. Wrong answer. She's so stupid... Hey, Roshe. Is your name Rosh, Roshi? - Um, yeah, Roshe. - Roshe, Roshe. Yeah, in that cupboard there, there should be chocolate. Just help me make chocolate sauce. - You need help. - Why would I need her help? - She's annoying. - Why is she even here? - D'you know what I mean? - Whoops. Oh! - Miss, she done that on purpose! - Who do you think you talking to? Stop! What are you doing? Sit down! Stop! Roshe. Whoa, whoa! What's going on? Girls! Sit down! Shola, put it down. Roshe, over here. Roshe. Shola! - Waste girl! - Shola! Sit down. - Come on. - Miss, she did that on purpose! - Stupid bitch! - What is going on? Oh, my God. For goodness sake. Roshe! Keep your voices down, please and clean yourself up then I want you all outside my office. Come on, girls. Um, can I borrow your lip-gloss? - Yeah, go on. - Thanks. Who done your nails? Oh, um, my...

Does everyone get to take the frog? Of course everyone does cause otherwise it wouldn't be a class pet. It'd be more like a pet. - Just a pet. - What's the frog's name? Tiny. cause he's a tiny little frog. That's why the class named him Tiny. Are those people outside our door? Yeah. Someone was looking for you. - Come on, let's go upstairs. - Wait, come. Wait, what? We're supposed to go upstairs. Just come, come with me. Come, come, come with me. Come on! Just come, come, come! - And wait here. Just wait here. - I wanna go to Mummy. - I wanna...

Yeah, definitely, if you're worried. I know the mum. She gets very down sometimes. I mean, don't get me wrong she's a lovely mum when she's on form but I haven't seen her for a little while and I am getting a bit worried for the kids. If Mum doesn't come then maybe we're gonna have to follow up. Ribbit. Ribbit. Ribbit. Ribbit. ...wait till they get back from school. You've been here before, haven't you? Yeah, I've, er...

Sumaya, go get him it, please. No, you get it. I'm not getting it. - Why? - I don't get stuff for people. That's long. Rocks, yeah, the only reason why she's moving like this is because I'm going to uni and our brother's gonna get married. - She's gonna be left all alone. - As if I care about you guys. She says when she was crying in my bed. Anyway! Anyway, who's gonna be doing all the stuff in the house... I don't know who your bridesmaids are gonna be, to be honest. There's nothing to hate on. What do you mean there's nothing to hate on? Are you sure? Sumaya, chop-chop, man! Good boy. ♪ Ba-da-da-dum, ba-da-da-dum ♪ Oh, my God!

We'll see. bro, I have no one. So you think you... leaving me is gonna affect me in any kind of way? It doesn't. So don't feel like you have any gain in my life. Don't feel like you... don't feel like you do nothin'. cause you do nothing. I've lost everyone. I have no mum. - I have no dad... - Listen! ...so you leaving me doesn't mean anything. - So, shut up! - Then why are you in my house? Wow. So cool. Have a good day at school, Emmanuel. Shit. Emmanuel, come on, let's go. You know that we've been looking at Pablo Picasso. We know that we've been looking at Cubism. I want you to think about how he recreates the portraits and replaces the facial features in his portraits. While you're working today, I want you to talk to each other about what is it that people do to make judgments about you. What is it people see when they look at you? Oh, wow. Why have you done it in a box like that? I feel like you guys have an identity, right. Like, if we talk about like culture and stuff, because... I feel like being English is just boring. cause we're living in this country and we know about that if you went to Bangladesh they would think, "Wow! She's English." Like... Like, "What type of tea does she drink and stuff like..." You know what I mean? Sabina didn't you find out about your grandparents? Yeah, yeah. In, um, Auschwitz. Wait, so your great grand... your grandparents - were in Auschwitz? - Yeah, yeah. My great grandad survived the war. - We went to see... - No way! They had their own little, like, block for like, gypsies. How were they in Auschwitz then? We don't have to be Jewish to not be classified as bad to Hitler, Agnes. He wasn't what Hitler thought was perfect. - Yeah. - That guy needs to fix up. Well, that's why he's dead. I don't think I wanna do singing no more. Like, I found my... I found my real passion. - Which is? - What is it? Guys, are you seeing this work of art? - You're taking the piss! - I'm gonna be the new Picasso, like. Are you... are y'all seeing this? Okay, so I'm walking up to the school gates just minding my own business. - And then guess who I see. - Who? Who? Ferrero Roshe. - New girl walks away with Rocks. - Was she in uniform? - I mean, were they both in uniform? - Ferrero Roshe. - No, I don't think so. - Why's she bunking with her? Sumaya, do you know? This girl making too much trouble, guys. Hi! - No school? - Erm, no, it's an inset day. What's that? It's, um, a teacher training day. Okay. And who's this handsome chap? His name's Emmanuel. - My little brother. - Ah. Hey. Go to the chair. Look, I'll show you something. She can do your feet. Come sit down. - How are you? - Anna? Oh, there's water. - Yeah? - This is Rocks, um... Hello. - She does make-up. - What kind of make-up do you do? Anything, like, a wedding, prom, birthdays. That's good. Maybe she can teach you something. Yeah, could I do it in the shop? Well... I don't know. Sometimes customers ask... I could start today, like right now. Oh. You are keen. Leave your phone number. I'll give you a ring if we need anybody. - Oh. - Okay? You need to press that button again. I've got a motive if you wanna go. - What motive? - You gotta leave Emmanuel here. - Would your mum allow it? - Yeah, watch this. Anna... Me and Rocks want to go to the library but leave Emmanuel here? - It's fine with me. - Well, you're lucky. Okay, don't be long. - I left my number here. - Alright then. Are you okay? - Yeah. - What is this rubbish? - Nail polish. - Wow. Yo, yo, do I hear that? Do... Do I hear... No kids, yeah, is that it? No children. Aw! ♪ Come to the ends, yeah ♪ Why you called Rocks, then? When me and Sumaya were younger, girls were picking on her, so then I backed Sumaya.

I'm trying to figure something out. Can't we go to one of your friend's houses? "Don't trust this girl, she stole from me..." What? Oh, fuck. Are Agnes' parents asleep yet? Yes, they are, so when you get there you have to be quiet, okay? I thought Agnes wasn't your real friend? What are you talking about? I've known her since primary school. Don't say that when we get there. Don't bug Agnes and mind that slug. Shh, we have to be quiet. Mind that slug! - You alright? - Yeah, I'm good. Be quiet though, cause my mum's right down there. Come on then. D'you wanna talk? Dunno what to say. We already know what happened. How d'you know? Um, from... from Roshe. But looks like she's not even gonna come back to our school so just, just forget her. You just... can't keep, like, going on by yourself. I didn't even... I didn't even do anything. I'm not like the other kids that swear to their mum. I didn't do nothing to her. You know... there's gotta be a way to, like... sort all this. Sort all this out. What am I gonna do about Emmanuel? I remember staying here time ago. D'you think she's ever gonna come back? I don't know. Come on, you come with me. Yo, what are you doing? Hello? Excuse me. - Hi, I'm from Social Services... - Excuse me, Sir. - Where's Emmanuel? - Sorry, is it Rocks? - He's gonna be safe. - Can you stop walking? - Rocks... - Why are you still walking? - Emmanuel. - Whoa, whoa. Wait. What are you doing? I didn't ask for this, Agnes. Emmanuel? - Listen... - No! Hang on a minute, Rocks. Leave her alone! Can you get him out of the car, please? It's alright. If you don't come with us I'm gonna have to let Emmanuel go by himself. We're not going with you. Let him out the car! - No, we're not gonna go with you. - We'll put him somewhere safe. What are you doing? No! You gonna believe him over your sister? Rocks, come with us, we can see if we can keep you together. If you behave like this, we can't. Come on. Emmanuel, open the door! I was just asking for advice cause I wanted to help you guys. Emmanuel, open the door. Emmanuel, open... Why are you doing this to me? Emmanuel, open the door! Rocks, listen, you need to stop now. Okay? I'm sorry! Come in the car with us. Listen, come in the car with us or we gotta go without you. Stop, it's time to get in the car. Okay. - This is her bag. - Can I have his bag, please? Give me that, give me the pink one. Agnes... Look, you see, here's your things. - Rocks, I'm sorry. - Give me my shoes. Rocks, please, I'm really sorry. Can you put the window up? I just wanted to help you guys. Rocks, please. Rocks! Put the window up, please. Rocks. Mummy, Mummy! No! Please! I want Mummy. - Mummy! - You're alright. Mummy! Mummy! Mummy! You're gonna fall! We're gonna fall! Pew! Mayday! Mayday, mayday! Guardians of the Galaxy! Save yourselves! No! Here she is. Emmanuel. Let go. Come. - Let go. - Are you okay? - Yeah. - Yeah? Um, you're gonna have to go with these two people. - Okay? - Why? Aren't you coming? No, I'm not coming. Me, you and Mummy... are gonna be together soon. But you can't tell anyone. Pinky promise. Nobody. - I won't. - You have something there. - Where? - There. There! Hey! Emmanuel... Look, I'm sorry that we haven't got any local foster carers that can look after both of you. But there's a nice foster family in Hastings that are gonna take really good care of him and you'll be staying with a local foster carer. Come on. - My mum's coming back. - Yeah, maybe. Maybe. But we'll go with this for now. I'll arrange a visit but in the meantime if she wants, she can write a letter for me to pass on to him. I've managed to give Rocks a few bits but I think you might need to all pop down to the shop and get some more things. Where is her mother? We don't know. We suspect she's had difficulty managing her medication and mental health. Rocks have been looking after herself, looking after Emmanuel. Yeah? Are you hungry? No, I'm fine. You like curry goat? I don't really eat Jamaican food. Really? You do spicy food? Um, a little bit. I cook good. You don't have to worry about that. Thank you. If you fancy anything let me know and I'll heat some up for you, alright? Thank you. That's my pleasure. I'll... I'll leave you to settle. - Yeah. - If you want anything, I'm... just in the other room, alright? Okay. Okay. - Of course, you didn't know. - When do you know? When? When? No, I swear it was... It's next week, man. That bit! And he got so excited because he thought... Hubble bubble, toil and trouble... Cauldron bubble... Oh, so you're the witches now? Hey, Rocks. Come sit here. She only sit... Sit down, man. Don't be shy. Want some cake? Yeah. Ay, Rocks, man, where you been? - Chilling. - Ghosting. - She's been ghosting. - Ghosting on us like Casper! - They're so lame. - Casper the ghost! So, where's Emmanuel? He's in Hastings. Hastings?
