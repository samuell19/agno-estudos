Ready? Has someone stabbed you in the back? Have you been betrayed? Is your life's train stuck at Loneliness Station? Do you have an HDTV at home but no one to watch it with you? Do you have many contacts on your phone but nobody to talk to? Are you living in fear and frustration? Is suicide a better alternative than dealing with loneliness? But... I won't let that happen. I, Ramchandra Negi, an International Loneliness detective, won't let that happen. I will come to your house. I will share your food and water. I'll share your bed and I will cure your loneliness. So, call 1800-Ramchandra Negi today. Your International Loneliness detective. Good morning, Prahastha. We'll be touching down in 30 minutes. Okay? Yesterday... as part of the Rakshas Manushya Peace Treaty, 20 more mega-spaceships were launched. -They'll help in human transition. -And Astronaut Duryodhan, after spending 75 years in space, has retired and will be returning to Earth. We have a fresh batch of students graduating from the National Technology of Transition University. They'll be joining the existing spaceships as assistants. Six astronauts were sent to space in accordance with the historic peace treaty signed 75 years ago. He is one of them. This treaty led to de-escalation in the cold war between humans and demons. We have a light day today. Prahastha? Every day is a light day for you, sir. Can you hear me, Prahastha? Local impact on communication module. Prahastha! Prahastha! I need to go out in the field, I guess. Okay, going code red. Can you hear me? Hello-- Prahastha! We are scheduled for a touchdown in 20 minutes. Can you hear me? We are 35,000 km away from Earth and the cargo will arrive in ten minutes. Can you hear me? Hello, Prahastha? Prahastha, can you hear us? Yes, Mr. Nitigya, I can hear you. The communication is back up. Go ahead. Prahastha, the cargo arrives in ten minutes. Setting up communication link. Okay. Countdown start. Ten... nine... eight... seven... six... five... four... three... two... one... O. Name, KC Sarkar. Age, 72. Mr. KC Sarkar? You just died of a sudden heart attack. I'm Prahastha, a demon from the Post-Death Transition Services and I welcome you to Pushpak 634A. It's time we transition you to your next life. Please follow me. WELCOME TO PDTS Sir, please place all your belongings in this tray. Please follow me for the remaining formalities. Sir, please place both your palms here. Mr. Nitigya! There is a pigeon with the cargo. Yes, I saw it. Please focus on the main cargo. Do you feel any pain? Because I can heal it. This instrument is a little faulty, but you should be fine. It won't erase any scars you might have, but otherwise, it will completely repair your body. Sir... please come with me. Going for final extraction. Okay. Extraction complete. Transition successful. Standby for cargo. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Post-Death Transition Services. Back in ancient times, this is what humans thought we looked like. This. Yamraj (Lord of death) and sons, every time they felt like it, stepped out for their nightly excursions and transitioned the soul of any dead human they found. They were called "The scavengers". In this small factory, my late grandfather laid the vision of Post-Death Transition Services. And we started storing and accounting souls on computers and data centers. After 15 years of immeasurable hard work, the Rakshas Manushya Peace Treaty was signed. Post that, we launched the Pushpak Series. We sent the first six astronauts to space. Today, we have our own universities. We have our international headquarters and offices all over the world. And as you can see, we have brought about a very positive change in the public image of the Demon-kind. If you want to be a part of this movement... Let's make afterlives better. Ma'am, are you okay? Can you call Ashok? Who? Ashok! Who's Ashok? My son. I didn't even use it. I just switch it on, and it stuns me. How long has this been happening? Did you drop it? No, sir. I didn't drop it. Please have it replaced as soon as you can. Actually, there is a rumor that the factory which made it is shutting down. They violated some regulations. There's one task you haven't completed yet, Prahastha. You haven't sent the training video for new recruits. It's really important-- Sir, let's do this. Send me two bottles and I will fill it with my blood and send it back to you. Actually... you have to be more social. Look at the other astronauts... they send so many videos about their lives in space. They are social media celebrities. And you, on the other hand, you don't even bother replying to your fan mails. You've been up there for so many years. Has anyone ever seen you? Maybe it's just me. By the way, your assistant has arrived at the base station. I'll connect you tomorrow for a chat. I don't need an assistant, sir. An assistant will increase the ship's throughput. You didn't give me an assistant when I had asked for one! Now I don't need one. It's the new protocol. I'm leaving early today. It's my marriage anniversary. We have completed 137 years together. I need to get a gift for my wife. Any suggestions? Hey! Alright. Discarding waste. Welcome to Underground world's program, The Voice. Today we have a veteran actress Ms. Kadambari. She was a top celebrity back in the day and is also a shape-shifting cobra. Of course, we will talk to her about her films. But we will also talk about the current protests by Spell-casting Demons and Underground Demons. I'm told you're getting a new assistant. That's nice. I'm being told as well, sir. It will be nice... if you have an assistant. You can finally retire as well. I won't retire, Mr. Chaitanya. This is where I die. A magician came to my ship today. And he reminded me of our training station's magician mailman. Remember him? He would do magic shows at night, and during the day, he would deliver letters to the wrong addresses. When you finally agreed to our first date I went to him for advice and he told me to get you butterscotch ice cream. That's how I could win you over. And I did win you over. For years, I thought that you agreed to date me because of that ice cream and not because of me. Hello and welcome today. Today we have with us... Ronjoy. Ronjoy, what is your special talent? Nothing special, ma'am. I just have a tail. Why are you guys laughing? Okay, so, what exactly are you planning to do with it? You can do many things with it. You have to find your own strength. You have to become self-reliant. What do you guys say? RAMCHANDRA NEGI INTERNATIONAL LONELINESS DETECTIVE Sir, why are you hitting me? Give me the stick! Please come. Aren't you Mr. Mistry's younger son? Sorry? Why are you hiding here? Prahastha... I'm connecting your call. Your assistant is in the base area. We'll... send your assistant this week if the weather holds up. Have a word with your assistant. Okay. Hello. Hello, sir! This is Yuvishka Shekhar reporting. Thank you so much for having me in the extraction bay. Actually, I'm a big fan. I have been following your work and your reports-- One minute. Are you my new assistant? Yes, sir. And, sir, I'm very thankful for this wonderful and exciting opportunity. My vision is to make our ship the best spaceship and ensure that we do the most number of transitions. Okay, I'm assuming you have done some training. Yes, sir. I am the valedictorian of the institute. And... I also have some social service experience. And, sir, additionally... I have healing powers as well. Healing powers? Yes, if there is any cargo with any kind of injury or ailment, I can heal them. I have this power because of my mother's genes. Okay. Yes, sir. Okay, sir. See you this week. Mr. Nitigya? Tell me, Prahastha. Can I have... a male assistant? What? I mean... like, you have chosen a female assistant. -Can you send a male assistant instead? -Prahastha! I hope you are saying this off the record. You have been in space for a long time. Maybe you aren't aware. Women have overtaken men down here. If men have reached the moon, the women have reached Mars! By the time men reach Mars, women will be on Jupiter. You could be deemed guilty of gender discrimination for your statement. Okay, I'm sorry. Okay, bye. Mr. Temchand, can you tell us about your special power? I can dry any wet object immediately. That's nice! Why does the audience find everything funny? The textile industry could really use your power. You can help them out. We could use you to dry cricket fields. Your power is really useful! What have you done with your power? Well, I use it to dry clothes at home. You see, this is the problem. You have to be progressive! -Having power and not exploring -Mr. Chaitanya! its potential is disastrous! Today we want, sorry, what's your name? -Temchand... -Temchand! Mr. Chaitanya! I have known you for many years now. But I've never asked you this. What are your powers? I don't sleep. I haven't slept since I was ten years old. My body regenerates automatically. People said I could only grow up to be a watchman. Everyone would sleep and I would stare at them like a ghost. Well, I am a watchman. But I am a watchman for IPSO! Good morning, Prahastha. Sorry for waking you up early. But I do have some good news! Because of the route being clear, we have dispatched your assistant, Yuvishka. She will arrive in five minutes. Five minutes? Why didn't you wake me up? We thought we should let you sleep and not disturb you. Hatch is opening. Pod is descending. Hello, Ms. Yuvishka! I welcome you to Pushpak 634A. Come on. I'll take that one. Hello, this is Yuvishka reporting from Pushpak 634A. I successfully landed here... at 02:39 EST and 05:29 Local Time. Astronaut Prahastha has very warmly welcomed me. Yes, Ms. Vasundhara? Yes, I have landed. Yes, of course. Yes, he's here. One second. Sir! We have a designer in our base. She's a really huge fan. Can you talk to her? Yes? Yes, yes. The climate here is-- No! Please, no! There are a lot more boxes. I'm keeping them here. We will enter the orbit in 30 seconds. Mr. Nitigya! Good morning! I told you I would get here in 48 hours! -Aren't you shocked? -Actually, it's Mr. Prahastha who's really shocked! So, Mr. Nitigya-- Well, Mr. Nitigya, you are looking pretty good on the screen. It's my new shirt. My wife gave it to me yesterday. And you're wearing it the very next day? Why not save it? There's a joy in being impulsive! Standby for cargo. Countdown start. Ten... nine... eight... seven... six... five... four... three two... one... O. Hello? Yeah. I'll call Rakesh. You can replace Vishesh. And Vishesh can replace Ramesh. Correct. Okay, I'm about to enter an elevator. I'll call you in a minute. Okay, bye. What the hell! Hello? Yes, man! I'm on my way. One minute! What the hell! Please close the door. Please close the door. Hello? Hello, can you hear me? Mr. Bhavesh Joshi? You've died in an elevator crash. I'm Prahastha and I welcome you to Pushpak 634A-- Hello? Sir. My name is Yuvishka. I'm an agent of the Post-Death Transition Services. And I welcome you here. Okay. Phone. The other one. Come in. Sir! I request you to place your hands on the scanning machine. -Here? -Yes. Okay. Ma'am, will I get my phone back once this is done? No, sir. All your belongings will be discarded. Well, I've been working on an important deal for the past year. -One phone call-- -It's against the rules. Listen, if you cooperate with me, I'll cooperate with you as well, right? -But-- -Thank you. Sir! -Sir! -Just a minute! Sir, you're not allowed to do this. -Please! -Hello? Yeah, Vikesh! Vikesh, I need you to replace Rakesh... and give the apartment to Ramesh. This isn't a demo, this is fieldwork! Let them make a down payment. That's important! -Sir... please! -Okay, thank you. I'm done. Okay, bye. I request you to sit here. What is this? Don't worry, just relax. I mean, what does this machine do? Sir, this is a memory wipe device. Your memories will be wiped out. But don't worry, it's a tried-and-true method. Sir? I'm sorry! I can't do this. What did you reveal it to the cargo? Because the new cargo interaction handbook says, we should inform the cargo about every procedure we conduct. -Handbook? -Yes. So, I need to learn about the handbook from you? This is Mr. Bhavesh Joshi. He is my first cargo. First, we cleared his memory. And this is our extraction bay where his body will be extracted. Mr. Nitigya! Is she really the best candidate you could send up here? Because if she is, I'm really worried about our university. I am drowning in work up here-- Relax, relax, Prahastha! It's her first day. She's bound to make mistakes. Mistakes are a different thing, sir. Give it a thought and tell me, do you, personally, think that she's the best candidate? Excuse me, sir? Mr. Prahastha... are you complaining about me? No, I'm not complaining. We're just discussing. Mr. Nitigya, he uses really outdated techniques and protocols. Outdated? You weren't happy when I mentioned the new handbook. Okay, wait. The next cargo is very critical. I suggest you two co-operate with each other. Okay? Sure, sir. And you told me she has some latest healing powers? I haven't seen a single sign of it yet. Let's deal with this at night. Okay... come to cargo area. Cargo is entering soon. -What are you waiting for? -No, stop. Can you dance? Yes, sir. I can dance like Ryan Gosling. -May I? -Try something different. Can you perform stunts? Yes, of course. Okay, that's all we need. Meet us tomorrow. Okay. -Alright, bye. -Tomorrow? Are you sure? Yes, thank you, bye. Call the body double. Please get the ladder! Sir... I go straight... I take a left... I turn right... and then you set the fire... and crush me with rocks. And in the next scene, we'll throw some snakes at you. Can we do a rehearsal for safety? No, let's go for take. Let's keep the momentum going. Okay, sir. Let's go for the final take. Okay, let's have a rehearsal. Come on. Action! One, two, three! Sir, can I try healing him? No, Ms. Yuvishka. You'll just be an observer for this cargo. Sir, these machines have been-- There are batteries in your room please get them. Sir-- Please, we don't have the time! Quick! Sir. Prahastha this is taking too long. Sir, just give me five minutes. Can Yuvishka try? Please... let Yuvishka try. Sir, please let me try. Sir, please. Go! Sir, can you please step back? What? I am not being able to focus. Are you really capable of handling this case? Sir, please. All my life, I was just an extra and a stuntman. I hope that I become Salman Khan in my next life. This is the first time I'm going live from Pushpak 634A. This is very exciting for me. Here we keep the gravity and temperature under control. As you can see, this is my toy and it is working perfectly well. Some people want to know where we sleep? So... this is it. This is my tiny cozy bed. Let the room size not fool you. It is very easy to lose things here. I have already misplaced my glasses and my ID card. This is my... toothbrush and toothpaste. And... these are some things that I have brought with me. Because they remind me of home. So, Prahastha? No complaints, right? Right? I told you I'm sending you the best student. Today was your first day. Did well. In fact, good job. Thank you. Sir? You can... lift any object in the air, right? Actually... I can lift anything and throw it anywhere. I used to think this was a really boring and useless power. And I had developed a huge complex. But a vegetable vendor visited our building one day. In those days, people on higher floors, would get their vegetables by throwing a basket and a rope for the vendor and then pulling it back up. So, I used my powers... to send up a basket of vegetables. And I became a hero for the aunties and a superhero for the kids. Sir, where does our food come from? The dead bodies that we extract... the whole day. I'm sorry. Are you a vegetarian? I'm really sorry, Ms. Yuvishka. I was joking. Please... eat. Our food stock arrives every six months from the base station. If you have any food preferences, let me know, I can talk to Mr. Nitigya. May I click a picture of the food? Okay. Ms. Yuvishka, where did you get this watch? From the cargo we extracted this morning. So, you stole it. What do you mean? We discard it anyway. One second. So, what next? If a rich cargo shows up with better stuff, you will treat him better than a poor cargo, who will probably show up empty-handed? Sir! This is a very common practice. It happens on every spaceship. In fact, they post "Find of the day" videos. But this is my spaceship. Here, you have to follow my rules. The watch that you're wearing is not your property. I don't think I need to spell it out for you. You should know this. I wanted to ask you something. Have you been living alone... all these years? We are always alone, wherever we live. What I mean is... am I the first one to live with you on this ship? Well, a detective was here once. When I tried to wipe his memory... I realized that a component in the machine had malfunctioned. He lived with me for 20 days! He was really funny! And really curious. Sometimes, he was just irritating. I would wonder when he would leave. One day... we got the component from the base station and he... was transitioned. There's another one. Something really weird happened. There was this girl who was here because she had overdosed on drugs. And for some reason, she thought there was a giant rat sitting next to me. And as I was taking her for final extraction, they revived her and sent her back to life. Now they tell me she has become a preacher and has 200 rats. This is our very special machine which is 75 years old. This is Antak-3000. This is our workstation. Every morning we receive a list of cargos. Today's list is already here which seems pretty long. And we get this list from our very own Mr. Nitigya! -He is a ground control officer. -Hi! Hi! He tells us what we are-- And that, of course, is Mr. Prahastha. Sir, your fans, they would love to hear you say something. Hello! Hello! Okay. And this is-- What the hell! How many times do I have to tell you that there are no phones allowed in here? I was making a video for my fans. Fans? You've been here for one day and you have fans? Hello, Yuvishka. Hello, Mr. Nitigya! Yesterday, a guy stopped me on the street and asked me... "Do you work for IPSO?" I said, "Yes." Then he asked me... if I could leak a video of you two. And what did you say? I said, "I'll hit you with my shoe!" Sir! That's a long list, Mr. Nitigya! Yeah, today the list is pretty long. Who's coming in today? Please be careful, sir! I could've died! Shit! Please be careful, sir! I could've died! Don't worry, sir. We are running a little late. We are almost there! Yes, sir! We are almost there! Here we are! I request you to maintain silence. I request you to maintain silence. In an unfortunate bus accident-- I welcome you to Pushpak 634A! What are you doing? Please maintain silence! Hello? Silence, please! Please maintain silence! Please form a queue. Please stand here, sir. Thanks. Please place your palms on the screen. Son! What are you doing? Hey! Where's your mother? Sir, one minute! Please! What are you doing? You're not allowed to take pictures. There's been a mistake. I am not supposed to be here. I was just filling in for my friend. I'm sorry, sir. But you can't click pictures in here. Please deposit your camera outside. Please! Ma'am, please place your belongings in the tray. This was a gift from my mother-in-law. It's been with my family for generations. I told you to not remove it from the locker! Excuse me, ma'am! My future wife is waiting for me. Please let me make one phone call. I'm sorry, sir. That's against the rules. Just one call. I just want to tell her to marry someone else and be happy. The call can help her rebuild her life. Please! Please, ma'am. Don't call her. You can text her. But please hurry. Thank you, ma'am. Ma'am, please do it. Sir, you guys can take your caps off. Yes, the camera as well. Sir! You can take him. -Yes, that's what I am doing. -Sure. Please, follow me. Sir! Can you please stand there? How dare she marry someone else, after I am dead? I texted her... "If you marry someone else, I'll haunt your husband for the rest of his life! You can't get rid of me." Perfect! Excuse me, you lied to me? I mean, it's fair, ma'am. Justice has to be delivered. I died because of her wedding. I'm going through this circus and she gets to live it up with someone else? I was stabbed! My brother stabbed me in the back! The kid who used to climb up on my shoulder... Sir... Ms. Yuvishka. Sir, please stay still. It's over. It's done. Done. I raised him like my son. What did I get? Are you feeling better now? Yeah. There is some pain. Ms. Yuvishka? Is this a hospital? No, sir. You've died. So, this is heaven? There is no heaven or hell, sir. Everyone comes here. Will my brother come here? Yes. What's the point? I did the right thing all my life. Helped everyone who needed me. And he conned people. But I ended up here and so will he. And what about Shadow? My pet Labrador. Who'll look after him? Ten... nine... eight... seven... six... five... four... three... two... one... O. Check this out! You're using a magnet. No, I'm not! Yes, you are! Why are you lying? That's a magic trick as well. Everyone's got their powers in school! The teacher told Mom, "Your son is a little slow." I had to do something myself. Tell her, you being slow is none of her business! Ghatotkach? Today we had a record number of transitions. In fact, I interacted with some cargos personally. And I learned something. I learned that all cargos have their own stories back on Earth. Just like I have my own story. But when the cargos die... does it mean that their stories end? And if they do... what's the point? There is no point to anything. A meteor shower is approaching our ship in the next six hours. Wait a second. We don't have to do much. Just go to sleep. The storm is expected to hit the extraction bay in the next eight hours. We don't have the exact calculations about its velocity but its parent comet-- Oh baby, for me, You are the moon But I am your sunny sunny afternoon Ms. Yuvishka! Either turn it off or lower the volume! Now our hearts Will never ever come together As you refuse to come And meet me here Ms. Yuvishka! My unwritten letters still cannot fathom I'm told you guys did a record number of transitions today? Are you prepared for the storm? Do we have an option? Anyway, you're all over today's news. What? People saw you today after many years. Okay. Which paper are you talking about? Mr. Chaitanya! Oh baby, for me, you are the moon But I am your sunny sunny afternoon How should we find a place to meet When I am here and you there Promise me that You will never let me go Promise! Promise! Yes, I Promise! This is the love you should know I'm your forget me not I'm always in your thoughts You are in my heart There's no doubt I am your forget me not I am always in your thoughts You are in my heart There's no doubt I am your forget me not I'm always looking out I am always in your thoughts You are in my heart There's no doubt I am your forget me not I'm always looking out I am always in your thoughts You are in my heart There's no doubt You're my forget me not I'm always in your thoughts You are in my heart There's no doubt You're my forget me not You're my forget me not I'm always in your thoughts You are in my heart There's no doubt I am your forget me not You're my forget me not I'm always in your thoughts You are in my heart There's no doubt I am your forget me not You're my forget me not I'm always in your thoughts You are in my heart There's no doubt -I am your forget me not -Oh, baby why? Oh, baby why? Oh, baby why? Why go away? I'm your forget me not I'm always in your thoughts You are in my heart There's no doubt I'm your forget me not Mr. Prahastha? Sir? Mr.-- Mr. Ankur Sareen. You have died because of a severe head injury. I welcome you to Pushpak 634A. I'm Yuvishka and I am here to help you. Please... follow me. Take off your mask, sir. Sir, please follow me. Sir, I'll just be back. Mr. Prahastha? Where are you? Mr. Prahastha? Mr. Prahastha, can you hear me? Sir? Sir, please follow me to the healing station. Please. Sir? Sir, please co-operate with us and come to the healing area. Please. Sir, we're not going to hurt you! We want to help you! Sir! I can help him! No, Ms. Yuvishka. You need to leave. It's not safe. I can't risk it. I'll handle this. Hello, sir? Can you hear me? Thank God! You guys are operational. Sir, please cancel all our cargos for the day. -No, we can't do that. -Sir! Sir, please, we just had an incident here. We had to transition the cargo without healing him. -Prahastha, it's a directed cargo. -Please! Please, take it. Come on. Okay, ready, ready! Ready. Stand by. Countdown start. Ten... nine... eight... seven... six... five... four... three... two... one... O. Extract this cargo as soon as possible. There could be another storm. Be fast! If the power fluctuates, you won't be able to extract him. Yuvishka can you please hurry. Okay, Yuvishka. Come on. Give your best. Come on! I'm sorry, sir. I don't think I can heal anyone anymore. Another storm approaching. Starting code red. Today is the fiftieth anniversary of the Rakshas Manushya Peace Treaty. And as you can see, there are celebrations... all over the town. Here you can see the historic footage of the Prime Minister signing the peace treaty. This is the live broadcast of the parade. And as we are celebrating down here, we regretfully inform you that because an unexpected meteor storm many spaceships have suffered serious damage. Here are some visuals from the scene. But please don't worry. Our ground control officers are in touch with the spaceships and our support team is helping them resolve any issues that might occur. The reports are alright. I checked the video feed. That was an aggressive cargo. Really, Mr. Nitigya? Was there nothing in him worth saving? Was there no way we could have helped him? We are going into low-power mode. You should get some rest. Okay. Mr. Nitigya! What do you think? Only Mr. Raman can help us. I was just reading this article on the internet. Read this. It says... "In most cases, when a healer-demon loses his power... the loss is most likely permanent. And additionally, if they lose their power they could be prone to diseases like yellow fever and plague. Sir, that's nonsense. You must be reading this on a fraud website. It's all here. Alright, we are going into low-power mode right now. I'm told things went south today. Is your hand alright? And Ms. Yuvishka? Those who are trapped have been advised to return. The Prime Minister offered his condolences to the families affected by the loss of 622XG. I think we overused your power yesterday. That could be the reason for your fatigue. I think you should take the day off. By the way... I have temporarily fixed this healing machine. We can use it for a few days. I thought these healing machines were banned. What? Yes. Many years ago. I was a part of the protest march. My mother is a doctor, so she was invited to the panel. I remember the slogans as well. "No more machine-doctors!" "No more machine-doctors!" Really? No one ever told me about this. Everyone knows this down there. We had collected and... burnt all the machines in my village. I am sure you were part of that as well, right? How did you go from shouting slogans in your village to being an astronaut up here? That's a long story. Want to hear it? Sure. Every year on my birthday we used to go to the annual Demon Carnival. And I used to rush to my favorite ride. It used to be the biggest ride at the carnival. One day, I looked back and I realized that... no one really cared about me. I thought... what if they forget me? They will forget how I look. They'll forget my nose. They'll forget my eyes. They'll forget my laugh. They'll forget my hands, my feet. And then... they'll forget that I ever existed. But then... Pushpak series was launched in the sky. The whole carnival was silent. They were all looking at the sky with their mouths wide open. Five spacecrafts flying away and a huge cloud of smoke behind them. I can never forget it. Then I realized that if I wasn't down here but up there in a spacecraft, I would never get lost. And they would never forget me. Good morning, Mr. Nitigya! Yes, good morning. It's dark out here. I was supposed to take a family vacation today. Chaitanya had signed it off as well. I had to cancel it! Five spaceships are untraceable. Everything is a mess here as well. When I started... I didn't have this competition. Life was easier. People were happier. I was a pilot in the air force back then. I thought, if I can fly a plane, I can fly a spaceship as well. That's it. I came up here and I became a hero. Prahastha! Mr. Prahastha! Nitigya, please clear the line. I need to have a word with you. Hello, Mr. Raman. Let's go to the cockpit, we'll talk there. Just give me a minute, please. Mr. Nitigya! What are your powers? I can disappear. What? Not completely. But... 86,75 percent. What do you mean? You want to see? See. I can still see you, sir. It's impossible to disappear completely, ma'am. So, 634A. There is something wrong with every ship. I didn't go home last night. I have read all the reports. Okay. The weather is not conducive... and there's plenty of backlog. We'll recall her when the weather improves. Sorry, sir, but, who are you gonna recall? Yuvishka, of course. I saw her report, she is not well. We'll call her back as soon as the weather improves. What? How could you even consider that, sir? Don't worry, Prahastha. We'll immediately send you a replacement. There is this new boy. Interview him tomorrow. No, sir. I will not be interviewing anyone. Because no one will be leaving this ship. Oh, God! Prahastha, please! Okay. Traveling isn't an option anyway. There are meteor showers and there's dust. No ship can take off right now. We have 48 hours. Observe her for the next 48 hours. If she improves... I won't call her back. Otherwise, she'll have to come back. Is that okay? Okay, sir.

Hello? -Yes, Mom? -Hello, sweetie! Don't worry about it. Quit the job, pack your stuff and come home. They don't deserve you. You know I can't do it. Of course, you can! Is this how they treat a topper? Your father was furious, he wants to burn their headquarters down. Mr. Prahastha can come here and extract his buddies! Don't worry about it. I'll get you a job right here at the hospital. You can work here with me. You're listening, right? Sure. Please come as soon as you can! I will come home.

Ten... nine... eight... seven... six... five... four... three... two... one... O. I was crossing the road and I looked left. It was a one-way street. And he came from the right side. He's okay, right? He is a young lad. I have seen him around. Hello? Hello, ma'am. This is Meena from Demon Tribune. Do you have a minute? No, I don't want to talk right now. Can you confirm the news we have heard? I'll let you know as soon as I get any information. Okay, as soon as you find out, please let us know. Yes. Sir? I have a small request. Please. Can I make one phone call? Sorry, sir. That's against the rules. Okay. No problem. Alright, do it. Sorry? You can make the call. I am okay. I am fine. You're okay? Yes, of course. I'll be coming! Yes. Everything will be okay. Okay. Okay. I know you. Sorry? You are our building plumber, right? But I always knew you had this secret identity. -Hello, Mr. Nitigya? -Yeah? Can you please send me the photographs of my first ten cargos? Why? I need to check something. I'll tell you later. Okay. Give me some time. Yeah, no problem. Thank you. It's him. He was here right now. Your cargos have started repeating, Prahastha. You've spent many years up there. I was thinking the same. I had received a mail alert. It's time for you to retire, Prahastha. An entire era has passed on Earth. I finally get why you wanted me to have an assistant and why Yuvishka was sent here. What could we do? We needed a backup. The other five astronauts are retiring as well. Their cargos had started repeating years ago. What now? We have an assistant on standby. Interview him. I'll connect you. Okay? I'm dialing. She has been tolerating you! Look at this man, he doesn't look a day over 50 and he's 638 years old. You have to find your own strength. Like I said-- There was a man here today. He was simple and kind. He was really worried about his wife. So, I extracted his dead body and I made this cake. Okay, bad joke. I'm sorry. Have you heard about the Ramchandra Negi Show? What? Ramchandra Negi. He's the International Loneliness Detective What detective? "Has someone stabbed you in the back? Have you been betrayed? Are you lonely? Is your life's train stuck at Loneliness Station? Call 1800 Ramchandra Negi, your loneliness detective." Okay. I'll think about it. "I will come to your house. I will share your food... and your water. I'll share your bed and I'll cure your loneliness." Mr. Prahastha, can you tell me... what do you do every day, all alone? I... I wait here... and the humans who die on earth... they come up here. First, I heal them. Then, I erase their memories. And finally, we go for transition. Where? Here. I have to admit, Mr. Prahastha, you have quite an interesting job. But... what is this? What? Letter to Mandakini. -A letter in the age of video calling. -Ms. Yuvishka-- -Mr. Chaitanya, please call her! -Yuvishka-- No! No! Chaitanya, don't call her. Please! Please return my letter. Please, this is not funny! This is my personal stuff. What... What are you guys doing? This isn't funny! Have you lost it? Hello? Hello? Hello. Hello, I got a call from this number. Sorry, I can't see anything. Okay, just... just one second. Hey! Prahastha! How are you? Well... all good. Good, good. Ma'am, I have cleaned the tank. Yeah, wait for five minutes. I'll pay you. Ma'am, I need to leave. I'll just be back in a second. These guys are really impatient. So... So? Just... all well. What about you? How many kids do you have? Two. Two? Yeah. Wow! Congratulations. Thanks. I've have started my own college as well. You started an entire college just for two kids? You're great! -Okay, I'm sorry. -Prahastha! We just finished the finals. Actually, Yuvishka was my student. Okay, I... -I didn't know that. -Yeah. Nobody told me. Yuvishka never told me either. Okay. So, why did you call? Actually, I didn't. Yuvishka called you. Alright. I guess, I will hang up. Okay. Bye. Was it Yuvishka again? Mandakini, please. Did you remember me? Or did you just forget? What do you think? But you never felt like you should call me? Ask me how I was? I thought you didn't need me anymore. You just cut yourself off from everyone. All these years. I feel like... I am talking to a ghost. Sometimes, I feel the same. I feel that the people who come here are alive and I am just a ghost. Prahastha... I wrote to you. I didn't get any letter. Because I never sent any. I wrote many letters, but I never sent any. I'm sorry. I have started packing my stuff. I'll leave tomorrow. After I leave... you will miss me for a few days. But... gradually, you will forget me. Maybe... after some time... you might miss me again. But then... you will forget me once again. Or it's possible that you might get better. And just stay here. Look! A Pushpak is heading home. Finally, the meteor dust has settled and all the spaceships are operational. All agents on standby are requested to resume their travel. Good morning, Prahastha! We will touchdown in 30 minutes. A special announcement for all the agents. If your cargos have started recognizing you, it means that they have already passed through your spaceship once. If the count of such cargos rises above ten, please contact your ground officer to initiate retirement proceedings. In other news, pop singer Shurpanakha launched a new music video for her hit single. Pushpak 622XG has returned to the launching bay and its recycling process has been initiated. Good morning, Ms. Yuvishka! I hope you are up and ready. You've had enough time off. It's time to get back to work. And... there won't be any media access in the spaceship for the day. I hope that's clear. Okay, sir! By that I mean, phone calls as well. Is that clear? Yes, Mom. Yeah, I'm packing. Countdown start. Ten... nine... eight... seven... five... four-- Sorry... let's do it again. Hello, friends! I am Chetan Kanodia. And this is my time machine. And for the first time, I will be traveling through time. As soon as I press this button, a space-time hole will be created around my body and I will travel through time. Hey, Chetan! Did you get your toothbrush instead of a pen? Eight... seven... six... five... four... three... two... one... My machine worked! It's working! Excuse me? Where am I? Is this the past or the future? Mr. Chetan Kanodia, I welcome you to Pushpak 634A. Now, I'll successfully send you to a safe place. The date and time are the same. Is this a parallel universe? Mr. Kanodia, I'm afraid you have died due to an electric shock. What-- I am Prahastha and I'll initiate your post-death transition. So, please, follow me. Ms. Yuvishka. Can you please try and heal him? I'll get the healing machine. So, where am I? Is this an aircraft? Yes. It's a spaceship. One of my friends had studied this. He posited that when you die... a spaceship sucks you up. And then puts you back on the ground. So, am I gonna go back home? Yes. To the same world? You want to go back to the same world? Yes, of course. I want to go back. Make the time machine. That's the reason I never had a family. And ironically... that's the reason I lost my life as well. You want to go back and do the same thing? Yes, of course! Of course! Of course! Total ten and he's the eleventh. Let's focus on Yuvishka for now. Hello, Prahastha! What's the status on Yuvishka. Any signs of improvement? Hello, sir. Hello, Yuvishka! I have to attend a meeting. We can have a test when I get back. Test? Yes, the next cargo that comes in... you have to cure him. If it goes well, great! If not, we'll have to see. I'll see you guys after the meeting. Sorry to interrupt. There's another cargo inbound. It's a joint suicide case. Wife got cancer, so they committed suicide to be together. Please come in, sir. Don't worry. I will find you. I don't want to take the test. I want to show you something. Yuvishka, hurry! Look. He is the one who just left. And this is his wife. They'll always find each other. People think that when they come here, they have lost everything. But the truth is... nothing is truly lost forever. There is always something, somewhere that survives. Always. Yes, Ghatotkach? Look at me! What? I think I am finally getting my powers. Ms. Yuvishka, the next cargo is on its way. Are you ready for the test? Food! Water! Air and Land! These were all free for everyone! But for these things, we now need to sell our souls. I won't take up some dumb job. What will you do? I will do a show. My own show! What's up, Mr. Negi? You've stopped posting videos. Do you have any new episodes coming up? I do it sometimes. But the family is more important, right? That's true. I'm on my way back. Okay. How's your dad doing? He passed away. What? He was a big fan! He used to say that because of your talent, people have realized... that they are living their lives as if they're already dead. Okay... no problem. We can try it again with the next cargo. I will just use this... I-- I'll... I'll just be back. Okay? Prahastha... I've read your report. There have been 13 repeats. We have to compulsorily retire you. Yes, sir. Once you get back... you will spend a year in rehab. You've been away for many years. You really need to adjust back to life here. Will you tell Yuvishka or should I? Tell her after I leave. All these years... I have only seen you through this screen. Tomorrow, we'll finally meet! Mr. Nitigya... thank you for everything. See you soon. Discarding waste. Good job, Ms. Yuvishka. Thank you. When I am here and you there Prahastha, ready? Promise me, That you'll never let me go Promise! Promise! Yes, I promise! You've lived here all these years, and yet, you don't have any luggage? I'm your forget me not I'm always in your thoughts You are in my heart There's no doubt I'm your forget me not I'm your forget me not I'm always in your thoughts You are in my heart There's no doubt I'm your forget me not I'm always looking out I'm always in your thoughts You are in my heart There's no doubt I'm your forget me not I'm always looking out I'm always in your thoughts You are in my heart There's no doubt I'm your forget me not You're my forget me not I'm always in your thoughts You are in my heart There's no doubt You're my forget me not You're my forget me not I'm always in your thoughts You are in my heart There's no doubt I'm your forget me not I'm always in your thoughts You are in my heart There's no doubt -I'm your forget me not -Oh, baby why?

Cameras weren't allowed but you can still look at some pictures. Mr. Prahastha will now spend a year in rehab. Mr. Nitigya? Haven't you met him? I'll meet him in the evening. I've been allotted the 04:00 p.m. slot. The ministers and important people are meeting him right now. Look what I found. Mr. Shashank is now entering the spaceship. Mr. Shashank. Hi, Shashank!
