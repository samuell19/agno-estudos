Sub by Oom St@R Langsa This film is based on a true story On June25, 1950 with the support of Russia, North Korea invaded the South, The South retreats to Nokdong River, the southern most region within a month, To pushh the enemies back, Gen McArthur initiated Incheon Landing Operation, and deployed diversionary attacks in Wonsan, Jumunjin, Kunsan and Jangsari. Without any men to spare, a ship called Moonsan, carrying 772 student soldiers hesded to Jangsari a day before the Incheon Landing, BATTLE OF JANGSARI 23 00 hours, September 13, 1950 You see anything? Visibility is too low, You had to pick the worst day for this, huh? You should've waited until after the typhoon, We should've landed before the 15th, but we wasted a day on the port, Do our enemies know we're coming? There are so many spies in Deagu and Busan, I heard that too. According to our informant, the stationed army is only a company, Our battalion can handle them, Battalion? The Kids downstairs? If you feel nauseated, shove your heads in those tins! Don't throw up on the floor! Buddy! That's for your food! Are you not gonna eat? Medic! So disgusting... Dammit! Seasickness will get us before the commies do. I heard your old man is a hunter. You must be used to firing a gun, I shot plenty of animals, But never humans, What's the difference? They're all animals, Buddy, look at it. Student Soldier My high school girls made this for me. The girl who put it on for me was so cute and shy, she turned rosy when I looked at her... He's puking again? Deagu boys never rode a boat, so they're getting seasick. Where are you from? Kota Langsa. Kota Langsa? - North Korea, Sir. - You don't have a commie accent, We moved down to the South a year after liberation, I lost the accent going to school here, Why did you came to the South? Some hooligans who hung out with the Russians took over our family mill, So father led my family over the border at night, Could I ask you something? What is it? Will only the 1 st company land with the boat? There arren't many boats, HQ said that's all they got, Don't worry, once we get off the boat... I'll wipe out all the commies. Just stay beside me, You know me, The greatest sharpshooter, Gok Man Deuk! Busan, South Korea Warship and fighter planes were supposed to attack first, then we'd land 200m from the beach, However, the waves are extremely high, and we only 4 have landing boats, And if the support artillery is called off due to the typhoon, we just have one plan. Even if this ship was requisitoned, imagine my position as the skipper! I'm begging you, If the sun rises before we land, the battle's over before it begins, How could they send these kids without any preparations? Tie yours rations properly, and put them on top of you bags, If they get wet during landing you can't eat them. Yo, Seoul punk! Worry about your shit, What? I'm gonna steal North Korean ration, so you stick to the bean powder. What? If you got beef with me, let's fight it out, Save the fighting for the commies, I'll save this for you, so tell me when you get hungry, "Tell me when you get hungry". That idiot talks like a bitch, stupid bastard. It's mine. What. When. Salute the Captain! As you were! In an hour, at 04 00 hours, we'll landing on Jangsari beach! Our strike team will reclaim the highland position, 200m away! UN fighter planes will provide air strike prior to our landing, and US battleship will fire artilleries at enemy position! Even though we'll receive support from them, we will be the ones putting our flag on the highland! Nine days after the takeover, we'll head back to Busan! We first win under you, you'll be returning home as a proud member of Myeong Unit! Let me ask you! Can you exist without a country? No, sir! Can your family exist without a country? No, sir! Good, we are fighting for our country and families! The victory we will achieve, and all of our passion will be remembered by our citizens forever! Endicott, Endicott, this is Moonsan, We'll arrive at our mission area in 39 minutes, over, If there's no artillery support, what'll happend to us? Moonsan, Moonsan, this is Endicott! This is Moonsan, are air strike and artillery ready? Over! We hear you, do you hear us, over! Moonsan, this is Endicott, can you hear us? Over! I don't believe this... We're almost there, we gotta slow down, Let's just stick to the plan, What plan? Maintain this speed. What if we get beached? So be it. Endicott, this is Moonsan. Prepare artillery ASAP, Let's bring them as close to the beach as possible. Are you nuts? There're only few landing boats! You wanna toss the kids in the middle the ocean? Engine, stop! it's okay! Don't be afraid! Don't move! Sit! Sit! Endicott, this is Moonsan. Sun will rise in an hour. We cannot wait any longer, we request... Endicott! Requesting immediate artillery support! Lower your head! Keep them down! It's okay, it's okay! Initiate landing! Full landing at once! Tie the rope anywhere! Only then, others can land! - Understand? - Yes, sir! Unit 1, deplay! - Raise! - Go! Unit 2, 3, deplay! Provide cover fire! Now! They'll all die at this rate! Come up! Sir! The rope mission ia too much for them! We'd lose all of them. I'll go myself, I can't rely on you at all. I know the current better than anyone! Captain! 2nd squad leader, Choi Sung Pil! I was a swimmer at school, let me go with them! Let's go. Let's go! Hurry up! Let's get going! Are you okay? I'll do it! - Watch out for the mines!. - Yes, sir. It's done, let's move! - Charge! - Charge! Attack! Disassemble your guns and put them back! Fall back! Regroup at once! Regroup! Let's go! gather the special ops team and flank right. Get the machine gunner on top of the hill. Right away, sir. 3rd and 4th companies, rest of my men will provide cover fire from here, so move to 10 o'clock position, 40m out for diversion until the special ops team takes over Tochka. Yes, sir. I'll take the left Tochka. By yourself? I managed to grab one. But not by yourself. I'm better off alone. You, Yes, sir. - Gae tae, - Sir. You're coming with me. Ya, sir. I'll come too! I shot the best and was the fastest back at the boot camp. - Okay, come with us, - Yes, sir. 1st and 2nd companies, begin cover fire! Let's go! Move out! Sniper! Can you hit the machine gunner from here? Soldiers are in the way. We'll lure them away, so take the shot. Full assault! Retreat! Anjeng! Highland secured! Mom... Mom it's Sang Ho. When I went to school on an emergency assembly, North Korean army barged in, and forced us into their uniforms, and took us to the frontline, It bothered me that I left without saying good bye to you. I already shot hundreds of bullets at our men. How many of them must have suffered from my bullets? I'm wearing my uniform school under the North Korean uniform. When I ever meet our soldiers, I'll tell them I'm a student at Kyunggi High. Then maybe they'll let me live. I hope this war ends soon. I miss my family so much. - Other seamen? - All dead, sir. 139 enemies killed, 14 POW's. 3 Tochkas destroyed, 2 canons, 1 mortar captured. and 2 Jeeps and a Truck are in decent condition. The Radio is busted and all radiomen are dead. Currently, there's no way to contact HQ. We got no ration left. May I send a few boys to a nearby village on a ration run? Go ahead. Find anything that we can eat. Why did we send his unit to Jangsari? He volunteered, He heard some stuff from POW, and wanted to put together a team, so told him to go ahead. Did the students complete training prior to deployment? What exactly is she writing about? She's asking if you'll be providing support, What is matter with this woman? If tomorrow's Incheon mission fails, everything's finished. I agreed to this interview for the sake of Col, Steven, and I appreciate that you're compassionate towards my men, but you need to maintain composure as a reporter. If the mission fails, it's all on Cpt, Lee. Get her out of my sight. What did she say? What did that Yankee bitch say? I did all I could, Endicott, Endicott, respond. This is Myeong Unit on Jangsari. Endicott, respond. I overheard their radioman's massage before retreat, 2 of regiments will deploy from Pohang tomorrow, 4T-34 tanks are included. How long will it take? Sunset tomorrow at the latest, What's wrong? You've already seen bodies, - Kid, - Yes, sir. Have a drink. Thank you, sir. Don't spit it out, it's precious. Just swallow it, Silly. I'm sure you had soju before, You're a smart looking kid. It's from the village, That's for our company, Where's my bowl? Easy, easy! Don't spill any, asshole! Water? They didn't give any water... You expect us to eat it raw? There's seawater, It's be super salty, Who cares, we got nothing to eat with anyway. I'll get some. This is beyond salty, my mouth is numb! This will kill us before our hunger! Dammit... You're actually eating it? The boat is ready. I wish you luck. You're are the only ones who can tell the world about us, We'll get it done, sir! Salute! 4 tank, huh? If we just get hit, how many more will die? We're sending your boys to Jangsari, Pardon? Just over 700, right? Yes, but... They're just student recruits, They're not ready at all, sir. A new commander will take your place, I made this decision with you in mind. I'd rather go, sir! You don't have battle experience, If the mission fails, how will you handle the backlash? Let's attack them. Rather than wait here for them to attack us, we're better off ambushing them. We're a strike team, after all, We can't just sit and take it, They know we don't have any transport, they'll think that we're dug in here on a defensive position, But we have their trucks and a jeep. A vanguard unit will use them, and engage in a guerrilla warfare on their route here, A suprise attack, If we manage to seal this tunnel, we could buy some time until our evac ships arrive, How many hours do we have to rig this tunnel up? They left Pohang early this morning, It'll take about 5,6 hours for them to reach the tunnel, which means we have about 2-3 hours at the most. We've got explosives left behind by them? Yes, 2 boxes of Russian made. The special ops team will change into their uniforms, gather the explosives and join me, And you, select a few smart men. Lt, Lee, we got a telegram. We have a telegram, US Army occupied Wolmido at 0800. 17 US soldiers injured, 108 enemies killed, 137 injured, It appears that Incheon landing was a success! An overwhelming success! We did it! Excuse me! 2 regiments... from North Korean 5th Division army just left for Jangsari.
