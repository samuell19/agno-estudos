Narrator: Between 1923 and 1928, two men collaborated to produce the poems, stories, and drawings of Winnie-the-Pooh-- two volumes of poetry and two of stories, books that have been translated into more than 20 languages. ♪ Narrator: This film has been made on location in England at the late A.A. Milne's London and Sussex homes, at Ernest Shephard's house and studio in Surrey, and at the places that both men knew and loved and put into their books 50 years ago. The Pooh verses and stories are read by Christopher Robin Milne, who also reads his father's comments on the writing of the earliest poems, the first appearance of Winnie-the-Pooh, and his collaboration with Ernest Shephard the illustrator and artist. Mr. Shephard, at over 90, remembers in his own words those early years of the century and the first occasions when he and Milne worked together on the humorous magazine "Punch." Shephard: I always drew from the very beginning. I'd been sending odd drawings to "Punch" And things like that and getting mostly sent back, you see. I thought of them as money spinners, really, because I so rarely had an inspiration for the joke, which was good enough for "Punch." I always remember the first drawing. It was some quotation of something. They took that. That was the first drawing I had in "Punch," And I think it's 1905 or '06, it might have been. Christopher: "Anybody who has heard of Ernest Shephard has probably heard of A.A. Milne. Just before the first war, we worked together on the weekly magazine "Punch." Once a week, the regular contributors of "Punch" met for a dinner to decide on the content of the political cartoons and other things for the next week's issue. At 24, I was the youngest to be invited to carve my initials on that famous table, to join those of Dickens, Thackeray, Sir John Tenniel, and many others. About this time, Shephard began drawing cartoons, and he, too, joined the "Punch" Table. As an assistant editor, I was very much an office boy-- Checking the printer's proofs, meeting with correspondents, And so on--but I still had to find time to make my own personal contribution to "Punch"-- a gay, I hoped, article of 1,200 words with a smile in every paragraph and a laugh in every inch. I was paid by the inch. Shephard sent in cartoons from time to time, and some were published. Strange to think of it now, but when he was making those early, tentative pictures, I used to say to F.H. Townsend, the art editor, on the occasion of each new Shephard drawing, 'What on earth to do you see in this lad? He's perfectly hopeless,' And Townsend would say complacently, 'You wait,' and Shephard continued to send in his sketches." Shephard: I wanted to go out and earn my living, you see, and I knew that I'd have to do that. I was already in love with my first wife, and I wanted to make some money to be able to offer myself, you see. Oh, it came very, very--yes-- irregularly in dribs and drabs. Well, I mean, we struggled along, and I got commissions until we were getting on a little better and we moved into shamley green, you see. [honk honk honk] Well, it was very rustic, very rural. [bicycle bell rings] I got to know the people. They accept you. Well, naturally. I mean, at the village shop, you went up there, they knew you, you know? Stent, the old man, he served in the shop, and Mrs. Stent, I know, served in the shop and lived in the cottage next door. Rawnsley offered to introduce me to Florence Nightingale, as he knew her quite well, and I couldn't afford the fare to go up, hardly ever went up to London. Christopher: "The world was not then the world it is today. I was very young, very lighthearted, confident of myself and confident of the future. I loved my work. I loved not working. I loved being in love. In 1913, Dorothy de Selincourt, Daphne to her friends, was persuaded to marry me. We had gone about together in a way common enough now but less usual in those days. When I wanted a present for a sister-in-law or a new suit for myself, I would ask her to help me. When she wanted a man to take her to a dance, she would ring me up. She laughed at my jokes. She had the most perfect sense of humor in the world. My next book was dedicated to my collaborator, who buys ink and paper, laughs, and, in fact, does all the really difficult parts of the business of writing." ♪ "In August of 1920, My collaborator produced a more personal work. We had intended to call it Rosemary but decided later that Billy would be more suitable, so we had to think of two other names. One was sort of Robin, the other Christopher-- Christopher Robin, names wasted on him who called himself Billy Moon as soon as he could talk and has been Moon to his friends and family ever since. When Christopher was 3, we took a house in north Wales for August. It rained continuously." [rain falling] "I pleaded urgent inspiration, took a pencil and an exercise book, and escaped to the summer house. So there I was, with an exercise book and pencil and a fixed determination not to leave the peaceful solitude of that summer house until it stopped raining, but sooner or later, I shall be asked what I was writing. There once was a dormouse who lived in a bed of delphiniums blue and geraniums red, and all the day long, he had a wonderful view of geraniums red and delphiniums blue. So what was I writing, a child's book of verses? Obviously, not a whole book, of course, but to write a few would be fun. Besides, my pencil had an India rubber on the end, just the thing for poetry. John had great, big, waterproof boots on. John had a great, big, waterproof hat. John had a great, big, waterproof mackintosh, 'And that,' said John, 'is that.'" Boy: Hello! "I had 11 wet days in that summer house and wrote 11 sets of verses. then I took the family back to London a little apologetically, feeling that a man of strong character would be writing that detective story and making £2,000 for the family, but I went on writing verses, and by the end of the year, I had enough for a book, but who was to illustrate it? My publisher suggested Shephard." Shephard: When Lucas suggested that I should illustrate his first book "When We Were Very Young," He said, "What, Shephard? Not that man who does those awful drawings in "Punch." That's quite a historic story now, but there it was. However, E.V. Lucas, you know, of course, a good friend, really, because he said, "Don't worry about what he says. do some of the drawings for this 'When We Were Very Young,' and we'll show them to Alan Milne." I thought they were such fun, the ones I read, that I said, "If this is the standard, I'd like to do it." I looked through the poems and picked out some and did some sketches and took them along to Alan. He captured the drawings most readily and pleased with them. He said, "Oh, I like these drawings you've done," And he said, "Yes. Go on and do some more." ♪ Christopher: "There once was a dormouse who lived in a bed of delphiniums blue and geraniums red, and all the day long, he had a wonderful view of geraniums red and delphiniums blue. The doctor stood frowning and shaking his head, and he took up his shiny, silk hat as he said, "What the patient requires is a change," And he went to see some chrysanthemum people in Kent. The dormouse lay there, and he gazed at the view of geraniums red and delphiniums blue, and he knew there was nothing he wanted instead of delphiniums blue and geraniums red." [marching footsteps] ♪ "They're changing guard at Buckingham Palace. Christopher Robin went down with Alice. Alice is marrying one of the guard. 'A soldier's life is terrible hard,' says Alice." [man shouting orders] "They're changing guard at Buckingham Palace. Christopher Robin went down with Alice. We saw a guard in the sentry box. 'One of the sergeants looks after their socks,' says Alice. They're changing guard at Buckingham Palace. Christopher Robin went down with Alice. We looked for the king, but he never came. 'Well, God take care of him, all the same,' says Alice. They're changing guard at Buckingham Palace. Christopher Robin went down with Alice. 'Do you think the king knows all about me?' 'Sure to, dear, but it's time for tea,' says Alice." ♪ [footsteps] "There are lions and roaring tigers, and enormous camels and things, there are biffalo-buffalo-bisons and a great big bear with wings. There's a sort of tiny potamus, and a tiny nosserus too. There are badgers and bidgers and bodgers, And a super-in-tendent's house, there are masses of goats, and a polar, and different kinds of mouse, and I think there's a sort of a something which is called a wallaboo-- but I gave buns to the elephant when I went down to the zoo! If you try to talk to the bison, He never quite understands; and you can't shake hands with a mingo-- he doesn't like shaking hands. And lions and roaring tigers hate saying, 'How do you do?'-- but I give buns to the elephant when I go down to the zoo! Wherever I am, there's always Pooh, there's always Pooh and me. Whatever I do, he wants to do, 'Where are you going today?' says Pooh: 'Well, that's very odd 'cos I was too.' 'Let's go together,' says Pooh, says he. 'Let's go together,' says Pooh. Llet's look for dragons,' I said to Pooh. 'Yes, let's,' said Pooh to me. We crossed the river and found a few-- 'Yes, those are dragons all right,' said Pooh. 'I'm not afraid,' I said to Pooh, and I held his paw and I shouted "Shoo!" So wherever I am, there's always Pooh, there's always Pooh and me. 'What would I do?' I said to Pooh, 'If it wasn't for you,' and Pooh said: 'True, 'it isn't much fun for one, but two, can stick together,' Says Pooh, says he. 'That's how it is,' says Pooh." Shephard: Before it is published, Methuen's, they offered me £50 for the drawings, the set of drawings, you see, and the day it was published, they invited me into the office and presented me with a check for £100, so that means I got £150 for doing the whole book, you see. [chuckles] When the book was complete and I'd done all the drawings, it had gone to press. Alan said to me that Methuen's had told him they wanted him to write a book, and he said, "I shall do it in my own time, but in any case, I shall want you to illustrate it," Which I think was quite a compliment. Christopher: "Once upon a time, about last Friday, Winnie-the-Pooh lived in a forest all by himself. in the same forest lived Christopher Robin, and nearby in the hundred acre wood Lived Piglet, Kanga, and Roo, Tigger, Rabbit, Owl, and Eeyore." ♪ "I finished the first two chapters of 'Winnie-the-Pooh' after a year's work and sent them to Shephard. The colossal success of the poems was in no small part due to his work, and I wanted him to do the drawings for "Winnie-the-Pooh." I asked him to come to our new house near the forest and see the places for himself, see all the things that were nearby that I had put into the book and hoped he would illustrate. Now, one day, Pooh and Piglet and Rabbit and Roo were all playing Poohsticks together. They had dropped their sticks in when Rabbit said, 'go,' and they had hurried across to the other side of the bridge, and now they were all leaning over the edge waiting to see whose stick would come out first. 'They always take longer than you think,' said Rabbit. 'I can see yours, Piglet,' said Pooh suddenly. 'Mine's a sort of grayish one,' said Piglet. 'Yes. That's what I can see. It's coming over onto my side.' 'Oh, no, it isn't. It's Eeyore,' and out floated Eeyore. 'I didn't know you were playing,' said Pooh. 'I'm not,' said Eeyore." Shephard: I got some pencil drawings of the bear that my boy had when he was young. Growler they called him, you see. The children called him Growler because when he laid down, he growled, which is a delightful thing to do, you see. He was a very superior bear. In fact, I've never seen a bear like him. He had a figure, too. I mean, he was dignified in a way. They have very little brain. Well, they're inclined to wander and bewildered. That's Pooh all over. He was inclined to be hazy in the brain a bit. Christopher: One day when he was out walking, he, Winnie-the-Pooh, came to an open place in the middle of the forest, and in the middle of this place was a large oak tree, and from the top of the tree came a loud, buzzing noise." [buzzing] "That buzzing noise means something. The only reason for making a buzzing noise that I know of is because you're a bee, and the only reason for being a bee that I know of is making honey, and the only reason for making honey is so as I can eat it." "It's a very funny thought that if bears were bees, They'd build their nests at the bottom of trees and, that being so, if bees were bears, we shouldn't have to climb up all these stairs. How sweet to be a cloud floating in the blue. Every little cloud always sings aloud. How sweet to be a cloud floating in the blue. It makes him very proud to be a little cloud." ♪ Shephard: I think that he retired into himself, very often for long periods, and then it was a great relief to him to change everything else and go off and do that. He was a different man going over the ground and showing me the places, all the spots where things happened. They're all drawn from the real thing, all the illustrations and the backgrounds. Christopher: "Eeyore stood by himself in a thistly corner of the forest and thought about things. Winnie-the-Pooh came stumping along. Eeyore was very glad to be able to stop thinking for a little In order to say, 'How do you do?' in a gloomy manner to him. 'Why, what's happened to your tail? It isn't there.' 'Then what is?' 'Nothing.' 'Let's have a look. I believe you're right.' Through copse and spinney marched bear To the hundred acre wood, for it is in the hundred acre wood that Owl lives, the chestnuts, an old-world residence Of great charm which was grander than anybody else's, or seemed so to bear, because it had both a knocker and a bell pull. 'Handsome bell rope, isn't it?' said owl. Pooh nodded. 'It reminds me of something, but I can't think what. Where did you get it?' 'I just came across it in the forest, and, as nobody seemed to want it, I took it home and--' 'Owl, you made a mistake. Somebody did want it.' 'Who?' 'Eeyore. My dear friend Eeyore, he was--he was fond of it.' 'Fond of it?' 'Attached to it.' When Christopher Robin had nailed it on its right place again, Eeyore frisked about the forest waving his tail so happily that Winnie-the-Pooh came over all funny and had to hurry home for a little snack of something." [typing] "Pooh looked up at his clock, which had stopped at 5 minutes to 11:00 some weeks ago. 'Nearly 11:00. You're just in time for a little smackerel of something, and then we'll go out, Piglet, and sing my song to Eeyore. It's a special outdoors song which has to be sung in the snow.' 'The more it snows, (tiddely pom), the more it goes (tiddely pom), the more it goes (tiddely pom), on snowing. and nobody knows (tiddely pom), how cold my toes (tiddely pom), how cold my toes (tiddely pom), are growing.'" ♪ "After thinking the matter out carefully, Piglet said, 'Pooh, it isn't the toes so much as the ears.' 'I've been thinking,' said Pooh, 'and what I've been thinking is this. I've been thinking about Eeyore. Let's build him a house.' 'What with all this snow and one thing and another, not to mention icicles and suchlike, it isn't so hot in my field about 3:00 in the morning. It isn't close. It isn't stuffy. In fact, it's cold.' The sun was so delightfully warm and the stone which had been sitting in it for a long time was so warm, too, that the Pooh had almost decided to go on being Pooh in the middle of the stream for the rest of the morning. 'I could spend a happy morning seeing Roo. I could spend a happy morning being Pooh, but it doesn't seem to matter if I don't get any fatter, and I don't get any fatter, what I do.' "I have not created the animals Pooh, Piglet, and Eeyore, Kanga and Roo and the rest. Christopher Robin and his mother gave life to them, and I have just put them into a book, and Ernest Shephard has drawn them. Between us, it may be we have given them shape, but you only have to look at them to see as I saw at once Tigger is bouncy, Piglet squeaky, Eeyore melancholy, and the Pooh is a bear of very little brain." Shephard: I had a lot of experience illustrating children's books, and I'd always done it straightforwardly. I'd done a drawing which I liked and which I felt, "This is a little thing children would like, and everything," And that was sufficient, and I think that pertains everywhere, I mean, in writing just the same, I imagine. If he felt he was writing to please himself and the children, too, that was good enough. Christopher: "Writing--let me confess it unashamedly--is fun, though there is something of inspiration in it, something of business, something, at times, of frustration, yet in the main, it is just thrill, the thrill of exploring. The more difficult the country, the more untraveled by the writer, the greater-- to me, anyhow--the thrill. As children, we have explored the world of imagination from end to end, and always the map of it lies buried in our hearts half-forgotten. a gleam from outside may light it up for us so that for a moment, it becomes clear again, and perhaps in that precious moment, we can make a copy of it for others." ♪ "'Where are we going?' said Pooh. 'Nowhere,' said Christopher Robin. So they began going there. They walked on thinking of this and that, and by and by they came to an enchanted place on the very top of the forest called Galleon's Lap which is 60-something trees in a circle, and Christopher knew that it was enchanted because nobody had ever been able to count whether it was 63 or 64. Sitting there, they could see the whole world spread out until it reached the sky, and whatever there was all the world over was with them in Galleon's Lap. 'When you wake up in the morning, Pooh,' Said Piglet at last, 'What's the first thing you say to yourself?' 'What's for breakfast?' said Pooh. 'What do you say, Piglet?' 'I say, "I wonder what's going to happen exciting today,"' Said Piglet. Pooh nodded thoughtfully. 'It's the same thing,' he said."
