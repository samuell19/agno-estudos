Do a rehearsal, or a general rehearsal Be, as the case may be, a success a triumph, or, on the contrary, a failure a triumph, or, on the contrary, a failure He possessed hope, but the boy didn't know that what counts is to know by whom he was possessed, what dark powers were entitled to lay claim to him. Usually, it begins like this: Death arrives, then we put on mourning Death arrives, then we put on mourning I don't know exactly why, but I did the opposite Dark Room I first put on mourning, But death never came. neither on the streets of Paris, nor on the shores of Lake Geneva. What? It's his test He could do very badly We did it three years ago Even late, I didn't have to go to any far off Samarkind The obstacles came themselves: that is, life. It's a stupid game for defending Toring. You're chickening out. But tell him what he needs to do! -Yes, tell him Soon, maybe Which may explain my slightly distressed look in the picture not because I was bent out of shape, but because I had bent the rules at some imagined Last Judgement The sole purpose of this film should be to determine that. No, I was already in mourning for myself, my sole and unique companion. I suspected that my soul had stumbled over my body and that it had left without offering a hand. Being and Time Let it be seen Listen Yes, it's difficult, this question of culture They confuse everything with art. If only, I knew Latin to make things clear. We'll talk tonight. Until tonight OK There is the rule. OK There is the exception. OK The rule is culture . No. Culture is a question of rules. It is part of the rules. Exception is a question of art. It is part of art. Everyone speaks the rule: Cigarettes, computers, t-shirts, television, tourism, war. And.... No one speaks In a sense, fear is the daughter of God. redeemed on Good Friday night. She is not beautiful to see sometimes mocked, sometimes cursed repudiated by everyone. And yet, don't be mistaken, she is at every deathbed. She intervenes for every man. No one speaks the exception. Everyone speaks the rule. No one speaks the exception. This cannot be spoken. That cannot be spoken. That cannot be spoken. It can be written: Flaubert... no Pushkin, Flaubert, Dostoevsky It can be written Flaubert, Dostoevsky It can be composed: Gershwin, Mozart It can be painted: Cezanne, Vermeer. It can be filmed:. Antonioni, Vigo. No. or it can be lived. or it can be lived. It is the art of living Srebrenica, Mostar, Sarajevo. yes, and It is part of the rules to want the death of the exception. It is part of the rules to want the death of the exception. No It is... It is therefore the rule of European culture the rule of European culture to organize the death of the art of living, which was still flourishing at our feet. In fact, in a rhyme there are always three things He said it in..... in 'La Rime en 194O'. 'Le Creve-coeur' ''When I close the book, I will have no regrets.'' ''I've seen so many people live so badly, and so many people die so well.'' The image is a pure creation of the mind. It can not be born of a comparison, but from drawing together two distant realities. The more the ties between these two realities are distant and right, the stronger the image will be. Two realities with no ties cannot be usefully drawn together No image is created. and two contrary realities do not reconcile with each other. An image is not strong because it is brutal or fantastic, but because the association of ideas is distant. distant, and correct. Gone from Liverpool Oh, how moving is the working of the unconscious (The heart of the problem) When one knows that the two forms of existence between which a being navigates Crystal and smoke, also signify the tragedy of the dead, which, in my parent's generation struck down individuals, vehicles of this tradition. The 'Kristallnacht'... and... the fog of smoke. 121 , one might say, ''The Manifesto of 121 '' ''Might we say, that where doubt is lacking, knowledge, too, is lacking?'' 125: A blind man asks me, ''Do you have two hands?'' Looking at my two hands would not reassure me. Yes, I do not know why I would trust my eyes, if I were in doubt. Yes, why woudn't I check my eyes by looking at whether I see my two hands? Wittgenstein, ''On certitude'' Diderot, '''A Letter on the Blind'' She said that only the heart and mind inspired fear in her. One of the advantages of lacking sight, especially for women, ''Never'' she said ''will a handsome man make me lose my head.'' ''And'', she added, ''Surveyors'' ''live most of their lives with their eyes closed.'' And now, Jeannot. Jeannot. which rhymes with stereo. Stereo is made for dogs and blind people. They always project like this, but they should project this way But because they project like this, because I, who listen and watch, am here, because I am opposite, because I receive this projection, because I reflect it, I am in the position described by this figure. This is the figure of stereo. But take this figure, and examine it in history now, and examine it in history now, for stereo also exists in history. There was Euclid. and then there was Pascal, Pascal, who reflected, and this is the mystical hexagram. But in history, the history of history, there was Germany, which projected Israel. Israel reflected this projection, and Israel found its cross. And the law of stereo continues. Israel projected the Palestinian people And the Palestinian people, in turn, bore their cross. That is the true legend of stereo. Nivose Goodbye Monsieur Jean. I'll change the flowers tomorrow Goodbye, Mme Levitz. Goodbye, Clemence. What are you doing? A story? She wants another story. Yes? What story? Stop asking for any old story! ''Any old story'' is very good. Here is any old story: There's a family of sharks watching a ship sink. And the father says to the kids ''Remember kids, women and children first.'' Goodbye, Monsieur Jean. He was stupefied, but, strangely enough he had no desire to dwell on the point. A thing is not what you say it is. It is much more. It is a set in the largest sense of the word. A chair is not a chair. It is an inconceivably complex structure Atomically electronically, chemically, etc. In turn, Thinking of it as a simple chair is what Korzybski termed ''identification''. and the totality of these identifications produces nonsense and tyranny. Winter 1944, at the beginning of spring We wanted to be useful. You know very well there's not only one way to be useful. and I am sure that she will be useful Ah, you are coarse! OK, I'll leave you alone. but who will help you here? We came to Corsica expressly to see you. I didn't ask for anything. An expensive trip for you to find your pasha and to get your money back. and you greet us while getting a horoscope with a disgusting blonde. How many men have you forgotten? As many women as you remember Don't go away I haven't moved Tell me something nice Sure, what do you want to here? lie to me tell me all these years you've waited, tell me All these years I've waited Tell me you'd have died if I hadn't come back. I would have died if you hadn't come back. Yell me you still love me like I love you. I still love you like you love me. Spirit has such power only to the extent that it contemplates the negative face to face. The kingdom of France! and... with it.... Ah, my homeland! Is it true? I have imagined you this way for a long time. Happy country, magic, dazzling, Oh beloved land, where are you? I can't see you alone any more, you're always with him, You're not leaving him, you know where you are, The signs among us I want a great future for him. You know what kind of life you will have here. I have a great past, Roads leading nowhere Monsieur Jean! Monsieur Jean! I'm going. What is tragic in sexual relations - Monsieur Jean! is the virginity of souls. - Monsieur Jean! I'm going - What is it, Adrienne? The departure of the wet nurse. Good luck, Monsieur Jean Goodbye, Adrienne. - Brigitte, Monsieur Jean. Brigitte. I'm not sure. ''In this woman's extreme confusion concerning earthly things, ''the sound of human speech barely reached her.'' ''But she no longer understood it.'' ''Her eyes were set on the vision that the dead contemplate forever.'' The end of Adrienne Mesurat. Thank you, Monsieur Jean. You are courageous - Oh yes? You'll end up on unemployment -No No. Delors said on television yesterday that Europe will build huge information highways, There will be work for everyone. ''Great piracy can only occur in powerful democratic countries, where the government is run by few, ''and where the state is responsible for immense enterprises.'' 183O, Alexis de Tocqueville. This is the evening hour, which P.-J. Toulet loved. ''The horizon is coming undone. A great ivory cloud to the west, from the zenith to the ground, the twilight sky. The immense solitude, already frozen, full of liquid silence. It is the hour of the poet, who distilled the life in his heart. to extract the secret essence, embalmed, poisonous.'' I entered his room for the last time.. It is the evening hour. The memory of the struggle where we confronted each other came back to me so strongly that I almost fainted. Paul-Jean Toulet. I opened the muslin veil, touching my fingers I said to her, be in peace, and she received this peace on her knees What a miracle that one can give that which one does not possess oneself. O sweet miracle from our empty hands ''While the orchestra plays its outdated repertoire, amid the banal crowd I see you from afar ''And you, divine, in silence, Your chin poised on one finger your eyes half closed, you think. ''I want you to be thinking of me.'' I am Anne Marie. Yes Yes Yes Filmcenter. Test. They are the Filmcenter inspectors. OK, see you later, my good Joseph Let's not waste any time. Mr. Bernard, you've done the universities, the books, and the photos, Mr. Andre, the films The reproductions of films In 1955, JLG announced that we will never see films on TV, only reproductions. -and Vietnam, it's not a person Shut up, Cassandra! Help! Help! And first, a few things because the truth is amongst us. This imbecile JLG should have known that by creating two or three Vietnams ipso facto... he would create two, or three Americas - Yes, even here we see the result. For America 1, 2, 3,... 16 Shelves For Germany, 2 shelves Russia 1 shelf Italy, the same Jean Renoir. an entire set of shelves. This imbecile J.L.G.... Monsieur Jean. in 1939, in ''The Rules of the Game'' - Anything else to declare? after ''The Grand Illusion'' and ''The Great Dictator'' by his friend Charles Spencer Chaplin, -Shut up, Cassandra Nothing else to declare? they were planning a second world war - Europe and its memories. Shut up, Cassandra -America has its T-shirts Your opinion on the Bern Convention and the GATT talks? Films are merchandise. They must be burnt. I told that to Langlois. But be careful of the fire within Art is like fire, It is born from what burns. 'Man's Hope', Andre Malraux. In 1914, Senator MacBridge... declared to Congress: ''Trade follows films!'' Only JLG noted this, in his ''Histoire(s) du Cinema 1A where he tells us that Melies had offices in New York, where he tells us that Melies had offices in New York, and that they were stolen by Paramount during the Verdun offensive. That's true, boss. We project our images at the same speed as the Americans 24, and not 25. The beginning of this story takes place in the minutes between night and day during the twilight of morning. In 'The Children Play Russian' JLG notes that in 1873 in his journal, a skinny, small, poor, sick Russian declared with assurance Europe is condemned to death. in 1873, in his journal, a skinny, small, poor, sick Russian declared with assurance: Europe is condemned to death. But what is Europe dying of? Dostoevsky Born in autumn, died in winter But why was he fascinated by by the torture of an innocent child by a brute? Because there must be a Russian people in swaddling clothes. These political slaves must have moral liberty, These brutes must have in the hell of drunkenness and massacres, must have a rich unconscious, unequalled in Europe, These people who are capable of anything, like cruel children who sleep the rest of the time in a terrible impotence must remain the only people in Europe who still have a God. Shut up, Cassandra! And that? Jean Cocteau. Bravo mademoiselle, continue. Roads leading nowhere Blank paper is the true mirror of man Landscapes traversed By whom? By what? If JLG by JLG exists What does this ''by JLG'' mean? It will concern childhood landscapes and of the past, with no one in them and also more recent landscapes where things were filmed. ''Land'' is in ''Landscape'' and two notions of fatherland can perhaps emerge, A homeland given, and a homeland conquered. Such as the negative Kafka spoke of, which was to be created, the positive having been given to us at birth. Thunder and lightning! Corpus christi! Is something wrong? These secretaries are all bitches. They've forgotten the main thing. -Really? What? Yes, all the films you've never made. Nothing to say? The list is long, Monsieur. Speak more loudly, my friend. What is it? I'm here for the assistant-editor job. When the blind Justice Fielding entered my room, she proclaimed with confidence ''This room is 9 meters wide 35 meters long and 5 meters high.'' And that was in keeping with the truth. Do you think I can have the job, Monsieur? No problem, Mademoiselle. Just a moment.... The producer guarantees that nothing will obstruct the free exercise by the distributor of the rights granted herein. Let's get to work. Come this way. She is blind, that bitch! A shady business OK, we have to go from shot 6/4 to shot 6/5 We see Rachel who -from 6/4 to 6/5 Exactly, Mademoiselle We see Rachel saying: ''I'll start over, too, then.'' Then she faints. Otherwise, how would I know that.. 56 images later, God takes her in his arms. If I know something And shot 6/4's time is up. while shot 6/5's is just beginning - 6/5. I am infallible And you must think there is a card. Playing cards? A title card, Mademoiselle. Everything was asleep. as if the entire universe were a vast mistake. And then we find Rachel facing the sea. After 153 images... she asks: ''Did you sleep with me?'' And she adds 34 images later ''I want to know'' I have cut there. May I repeat that? Gladly, Mademoiselle. -So Are you kidding? Just like the others. 100% for the distributors - I, too, start again... until the film breaks even, -then, I too Until the producer's net receipts equal the cost of the film. 56. 56. 1 53. 153. You slept with me. Yes. 34. - 34. I want to know. the nothing and the almost nothing Everything was asleep as if the entire universe was a vast mistake. Choice of the chosen I said to her one day: ''Mademoiselle, imagine a cube.'' I see it. Imagine, in its center, a point. It 's done. From this point, draw straight lines to the angles. You have now divided the cube. Into six equal pyramids each having the same face and base of the cube each having the same face and base of the cube and half of its height This is true. But where do you see it? In my head, like you. I took three steps in the veranda -In the veranda It can't continue like this! Simon went into this room, and I fainted And nothing happened. and it is the day, and I don't know And you, Simon, you kill me I begin my explanation again. It is night. Everything must be clear between us. I return to this room. I begin again. -Me, too. I don't understand. To have a lover is disgusting I think that a lover loves only love Not the other, opposite. I love open windows and cool sheets The temptation to exist Lord It is a film that has never been made You speak the truth, Mademoiselle. It is a film that no one has seen. If my left hand can touch my right hand, as it touches things touch it while touching Why, in touching the hand of another, will I not be touching the same power of joining things together that I touched with my hands? Yet........the domain, we quickly realize, is unlimited. If we can show that the flesh Is an ultimate idea that it is neither union nor composition of two substances. but can be conceived in itself. If the visible has a relationship to itself that goes through me and becomes me as I watch watching this circle, which I do not create but which creates me, this winding of the visible within the visible can go through and animate other bodies, as well as mine. And if I could understand how this wave is born in me, how the visible over there is simultaneously my landscape. I can understand that elsewhere, too, it closes in on itself (I am a legend) and that there are other landscapes than my own. When we express ourselves, we say more than we want to We think we express the individual, but we express the universal. I am cold. It is I who say ''I am cold''. But it is not I who is heard I disappeared between these two moments of speech. All that remains of me is the man who is cold and this man belongs to everyone. Where do you live? In language, and I cannot keep quiet. In speaking, I throw myself into an unknown place a foreign land. and I suddenly become in charge of it. I have to become universal. To realize, with humility, with caution by means of my own flesh, the universality I carelessly threw myself into out of thoughtlessness that is my sole possibility, t hat is my sole commandment I said that I love. That is the promise. What have you lost? What is this darkness? Ask, rather, what is a government? I said that I love. A group of people who govern. ''No,'' he said, with a a pale smile, ''a government is your accepting to let yourself be governed.'' But that's ridiculous. That would mean that there's nothing up there. Truly nothing. Exactly That is to say, to finally deserve the name That is what darkness is. -the name that was given to me. Precisely Self-portrait Not autobiography. Fourth thirty 3O/4O. - No,game, game Our pre war The past is never dead It hasn't even passed yet I am as happy to be passed I am as happy to be passed as not to be passed. And now my work is done, which neither the anger of Jupiter nor fire, nor sword, nor the gnawing tooth of time shall ever be able to destroy. Let that day, that only has power over my body, end when it will my uncertain span of years But that's my coat. yet the best part of me will be borne immortal, beyond the distant stars. Wherever America's influence extends, over the lands it has civilized Whatever the extent of American power over occupied lands, I will be spoken, on people's lips and, famous through the ages if there is truth in the poet's prophecies if there is truth in the poet's prophecies and once famous I shall live throughout eternity.. If I believe If I believe If there is some truth in the mouths of poets. I shall live It is not even the past yet I said that I love I said that I love That is the promise. Now, I have to sacrifice myself so that love exists on earth. so that love exists on earth. As a reward at the end of this long undertaking I will end up being he who loves. That is, I will deserve the name I gave myself. A man, nothing but a man, no better than any other, But no other better than him.
