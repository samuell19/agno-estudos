The Bloodstained Lawn Blood... - Nice car! Where are you taking me? - Get in. - Look, it's 10,000. - Get in. - Want to buy something? - Will you read my palm for five lira? - Yes, sure! Can I get in? - Come on, get in. - Is Genovese here? - Yes, he's in the back. - Where's my sister? - She stayed at the house, she sent me. But you know I'm no good at these things, why... - ls there any news? - I'll tell Nina. Tell me, who is he? Leave him be. - You don't want him back here. - Why? He's a drunk! Come on, let's go. Come with me. You can't stop now. You said it was close, but I don't see anything. One last push. We're almost there. Do you know how many kilometres we've still got left? - I'm tired, I'm stopping. - Then no one will stop for us. Let's rest for a while at least. - It might be better if I hide. - Why? What if they see me! Look at that beautiful colour. What a lovely shade of red. Yes, it looks like a bloodstained lawn. - Where are you heading? - Piacenza. Can we get in? What is it? A sports car? I wonderwhy he's so quiet? - Do you want me to leave you somewhere? - Wherever you want. If you don't know where to stay, I can take you to my sister's house... She's always happy to receive guests. Especially younger ones. Thanks, that would be great! It's me. Open up. You take it. You see... - They're doing well for themselves. - lt looks like a clinic. Go through to the lounge. I'll call my sister. See, this is a real house! Look at all the people. Good morning. Good morning. Do you want me to drink you? Look. It's frightening! - What is it? - Do you like it? I find it horrendous. It's one of my husband's ideas. Please, have a seat. It's nice here. You may all leave, please. l want to talk to these two... - Alone. - Come with me. - Where are you from? - Rome. - Where did you sleep last night? - In a barn, near Livorno. - Are you related? - No, we're lovers. - And your parents? - Haven't seen them for at least two years. - They haven't looked for you? - No, I don't think so... - We begged them to leave us in peace. - These were my father's last words... "For me, you might as well be dead." - How do you survive? - Max has a scholarship... And I do what I can. - You must have friends? - Yes, lots of friends, school friends. - Did they know about your trip? - No, we left without making any plans. I hate planning for anything. Studies, love... For me, everything has to be spontaneous. Natural, like flowers... Seasons. - Two drifters. - Yes, two drifters. Hello, dear. - What have you been doing all morning? - What have I done? I even went to the shop! It's not true. I called; you weren't there. No, you weren't there. Spare me the excuses, I'm busy. Yes, me too. I'm going upstairs. - What happened? - I cut my finger. - There must be a pin on the sofa. - No, it's nothing... Go with my husband. He'll treat you. No, don't suck it. You might get an infection. Yes. Come with me. Go. Here, at the table. - What are you doing? - No, it's nothing, don't worry. One moment. Now, I'll treat it. All done. - Would you like a drink? - Yes, thanks. - A whiskey? - Yes. Thanks. - What's your name? - Max. You play well, Max. This is my study My study laboratory. I invented all these things, I make them with my own hands, and my brain! You see, dear, I've studied for many years... I have scrutinised every development and evolution of vegetables and animals. From seed to flower. It has all passed through the filter of my research... And I have concluded that nature is flawed. It's down to us to modify and repair ourselves. What nature has done. The dynamics of automatism... This is perfection. Look here. Man and machine. Two inconceivable entities. - This is just a toy. - It's a bit sinister for a toy. - Soon, you'll see my masterpiece. - What do you mean? My wife calls it a toy. But it isn't a toy. Is this all for us? My husband and I eat very little in the evening... Cheese, fruit. We're vegetarians. - Isn't it tiring, travelling on foot? - Sometimes we hitch-hike. We must have covered five kilometres today. When I think of the things I did. I was very good at it. - Isn't he joining us? - He's drunk, he stayed in his room. That's a shame. Who? You met him. The guy with the long beard. The crazy one. The wine! Alfiero, will you get some wine, please. 3000 people disappear in Europe every year and we don't know anything. Sure, sure... Listen... This is the label from that brand of wine. - And where is this place? - It's in Emiglia, near Piacenza. Have you already been there? Not yet. We usually deal exclusively with drugs: heroin, cocaine, hashish, etc... But the rest... Arms trafficking, for example... It's worth millions. Black market medicine and who knows what else, at the cost of people's lives. Exploiting the innocent. Listen, boss... l'm going back to Italy. l'll let you know. Good luck. Here... These rooms are for the guests. My husband and I sleep in the attic upstairs. This is for you. Next door there's... Thank you, but we prefer to sleep together. - But there's only one bed. - It doesn't matter, we're used to it. Goodnight, kids. Finally, a bed. - Don't you think she's a bit strange? - She's okay. - There's even a shower. - You could wash. You know I don't like to. Let's put our things in the room. I don't like it like this. Give me the incense. - Why don't you cover that armchair? - Sure. Listen, Max, do you think they'll let us stay for long? How do I know? - She was spying on us. - Who? That lady. I told you they were strange. - Maybe she wanted to see me naked? - Then get undressed! - Is there anything left? - Yes. Let's get to work! Can you pass me a newspaper. - Give me the lighter. - This stuff is good! Are you going to pass it? Will you give me the cigarette? If I'm not disturbing you. They're all crazy here. This is my room. Come in. Look. Very strange... It looks like a prepared dinner. Look at her. I thought you were asleep. You should go back to your rooms. I wouldn't want to wake my sister. What about her? That girl? She's Antonio's niece... - There's a danger of epilepsy, so... - No... I saw herwhen they brought her, she was forced to come here. Have you been drinking again? You know, very soon you'll be seeing bats. Come. Look at him. So what? l like wine as well. - I'd like to speak to Mr. Testa. - Mr Testa is busy with a client. May I wait? Thank you. Then l'll see you on Saturday. and don't be late! - Mr. Testa, I need to talkto you. - Sure, come in! Have a seat. Tell me. - Cigarette? - No, thanks. - Are you the manager? - Yes, of course. I'll get straight to the point. I'm not with the police... Read it. I'm an agent from UNESCO. I'm sorry, but I can't tell you any more for now. Listen, roughly how many people does your company employ? More than 300. In Italy and overseas. That's a lot. Have you ever noticed any strange customers? When you're making deliveries. - No, nothing strange at all. - I want to show you something. Do you recognise it? - Sure, that's one of ourwines. - You see, it's the only lead I've got... And it starts right here, in this business. I'd like to speak to your staff. Only for a few minutes. Certainly. I'm at your complete disposal. I'll ask my son to accompany you. Luigi. - How many delivery vans have you got? - We've got eight vans and two tankers. - Do you have drivers for all of them? - No, we only employ four drivers. - Is this recent? - Yes, this year. - Are all the bottles sealed here? - Of course. - Is it possible to remove the seal? - It can be removed, if you want. M What is it? It's wine! Yes, wine! Not bad! Now hold on tight. Turn it off, orwe'll stink of wine! I'll wash you now. Max, look! The sculpture has disappeared. - They probably sold it. - But I saw it last night, it moved! You dreamt it. I told you that stuff was strong! - I can't stand this music. - But it's Wagner, Valentina. I don't like that Wagner very much. I really love German music. It makes us feel bigger, more important... it is, without a doubt, music for a superior race. Will you come next door? It's all ready. Good. - It's ready. - It's ready? Great! Excuse me. They're calling me. I could stay here for a month, as long as we don't have to pay. - Have you seen that girl? - How do I know? I'm not herwet-nurse! - Did you hear that? - I didn't hear anything. - Did you hear that? - No. I've had enough of this music! Haven't you noticed all the strange people in this house? - She's a... - Say it, a prostitute. You are two drifters, hippies. I'm just a bum. A good-for-nothing. It's almost like we've been brought here on purpose. Calm down, it's not the first someone's rented out a house. You know, they always want the same things... The master, the slave... screwing in front of everyone. It's such a drag sometimes. It's a hard job. - Let's go in the garden. - The eye also wants its share! - Did you see it? - Don't look. Have you seen the oven? We used to make bread. We made it at home. - Is it always the same itinerary? - Yes, two of them go to Rome, Naples... - The other two drivers... - Their names? Loconi and Miraglia. They drive north and abroad. Loconi lives here with his family. Miraglia lives in the village. - And their addresses? - Miraglia... Via Remondini, 31. - Is he working? - No, not now... It's early, he'll be back around midday for a delivery. - Where? - To Antonio Genovese, in Piacenza. See? This machine produces heptamers. They're chemical particles. Alcoholised. Molecular particles that combine with... With a secret substance! They produce a gas which disintegrates organic matter... - This method... - All pollutant organic matter! Then you can recreate man. There... Great. You understood it... One of these days, I'll show you my inventions, my machines... They call them toys, but they aren't toys. Hide. - Have you seen the drunk? - No, I haven't seen him. Alfiero. I'm looking for the drunk. I can't find him. - Need a hand? - No, I can manage. I'll find him. You'll be safe here. Sit yourself down here. Look... Want some? No, no, thanks. That machine you invented, that alcohol machine... Does it rejuvenate you if you drink it? Yes, but not like a man who is eventually destroyed by time... You see, man is a shit! From being tall, blonde, and thin... He becomes dark, short, fat, ugly, hairy... And he also sweats. Like you! L, however, have created... The perfect man! And you'll meet him... Soon. Tonight, even! - Come in. - Good morning. Please. - The mirrors are distorted. - Yes. They're all distorted. One of my husband's latest inventions. Shall we dance? Look at them! You dance well. Alfiero. - Champagne! - He brought drinks! Veuve Cliquot! Open it. Come on, take your clothes off! Don't be shy. Antonio. Your friend the drunk is waiting for you downstairs. Worms. - Just as I expected. - Are we going? Max. Wake up! Did you see? Maybe it was a dream. The party, all those mirrors. Then I had the same dream. No, I don't think so. Someone must have moved us. Or it was us, drunk... Look, I don't remember a thing. My head! I think they drugged us. Perhaps they did it to get us to do what they want. So much hassle to see us together! Well that's their problem. I swear they've got hashish in the house as well. Maybe that's why they're so mysterious. - It looks like a toy. - What did you say? I said it looks like a toy. Max. - Where are you going? - Can't you hear them arguing? You're a goat! A goat! You'll never understand. The misunderstood genius! - You're a child! - Why don't you understand my poetic world? Science is poetry. I'm not interested in money! You'd be sleeping under a bridge like that drunk if it wasn't for me. - He was a happy man! - You're an idiot! Only money brings happiness. Money buys you the will to live. With money you have power... With money you're a god. Look, fool... Money isn't my destiny Your destiny! Sure... Your manias. Your crazy games. - Please don't, Nina. - You're a paranoid lunatic. And you? Sucking the blood from others. 600,000 in the last six months. You call that madness? You talk like a shopkeeper. Oh, the “gentleman“! If I didn't take care of you! Who put us in contact with Ritter? Who got to know Miraglia? It was me! Where would you be without my science, my creations? Your creations? You're so ridiculous. I left you to play like a child. I don't know why I still put up with you. If I wanted to, I could destroy you in a second. - Nina, be careful. - You're so frightening! You're a worm! A dirty beetle! What are you doing? Stop that foolish contraption! See this? You're fired, scientist. Alfiero. Nina. - Don't touch me! - What's wrong with you? Tell me, what's wrong? - He's a monster, I've had enough! - What did he do to you? Yes... I needed him at first because he had money. - A blackmail I had to endure for years. - I know. Damned pig. I can't bear it when he touches me. We don't need him anymore. We don't need him anymore. Excuse me, lady... - I'm looking for Via Remondini. - It's round the corner, on the left. Chivas! Max, I don't like this place. Let's go away. Don't be afraid. We'll find a way out. This is the perfect moment. - There's no one around, come on! - We'll leave all our bags here? Yes, all of them. Damn it, it's locked! Look: how beautiful. They gave them to me... They're mine. Look how beautiful they are. They gave them to me. Don't you believe me? Would you like one? Aren't I generous! Let me see. I'll give them back. I know something about them because my father is a jeweller. They're beautiful. - These are real! - What do you mean? Damn! This is real gold. Yes, real diamonds. And these are sapphires! There's also an emerald, look! That's crazy! I know my sister's jewellery well. They're just imitations. Done very well. Come, let's follow him. We have to go down. I think they're hiding something terrible, I'm sure of it. Let's go down to the basement. Come on, let's go. But I'm scared. - Stay here if you're scared. - By myself? - I'd rather go with you. - Then let's go. - You know why they gave you that jewellery? - It seemed ridiculous. Right, a last cigarette before execution. It's a salami. What's this? It looks like blood. - Do you notice a strange smell? - lt smells like rotten meat. An organic substance. You could make a lot of spaghetti with all these tomatoes! It really is tomato. Let's find out where he went. That's strange... Instead of opening them he's closing them. - It's so cold. - lfsjust a big fridge, I'm going in. It's Venamina. It's absurd! Please, let's get out of here! - Good evening. - ls Mr. Miraglia here? - Hejust arrived. - Can you call him? - You're looking for me? - Miraglia, Antonio? - Yes. - Do you mind answering some questions? - Where? - Here's okay. So, Miraglia... - You like expensive whiskey - Why, is it illegal? No. You've got two million in cash hidden inside a book at your home. Who are you? You don't have the right. I'm with the police. Look, Miraglia, it's better if you talk... Tell me everything. It'll be better for you. I don't know anything. I haven't done anything... Ask the manager, I've never even stolen a bottle of wine. I'm not talking about robbery. This is serious! - Murder. - Murder! - I thought... - What did you think? - Nothing. - What do you mean, you animal? - What do you know? - I don't know anything. I don't know, I thought this was about contraband. Contraband? What kind of contraband? - Jewellery and gold. - Where did you take the wine? - To Piacenza. - Where in Piacenza? - I took it... - Where, animal? Talk! To our customers. Just people. Who did you take it to? Where? There's a shop... On Via Cavour. Mr. Genovese. Tell me, where does Genovese live? I want his address. He lives on Via Philipeschi, 26. I'm right here. In front of everyone! You' re crazy! Couldn't we play some jollier music? How much are you paying me for all this excitement? Sure, that jewellery you gave me is worth a lot. Well? Who's first? Which group? Group A is the most common, but the girl is a B. Very rare! What are you waiting for? Is it a new game? With other groups? Who am I with? Can I choose? Why don't you answer me? Do I have to keep lying here? What are you doing? Come on! There... It's time. You're insane. You're completely insane! I've taken my precautions. The wine! The wine leaves on our yacht. Destination the Orient, Vietnam, Bolivia... Wherever there are wars, and injured people. Blood is worth a lot. More than petrol or gold... And it's needed to save the lives of those who can afford it. I always follow a pre-ordained plan. A line of conduct... You've seen my victims... Worthless people. Prostitutes, drunks, gypsies... Drifters. Like you. People out of work, no families... People without roots. No one will cry for them. Their blood is worth more than their lives. Alfiero, put that whore on the table. You won't feel a thing. Call the robot. Done. Stop the robot. Antonio, you go. - It's better. - Yes, of course. - Who is it? - Testa sent me. - Yes, but who are you? - Miraglia. Okay, I'll open up. - You're not Miraglia! - No, I'm not Miraglia. - Antonio Genovese? - Yes, I'm Antonio Genovese. I know exactly who you are. - I have to search the house. - You can't come in! - Where is this music coming from? - It must be my wife. - Your wife? - Yes. - She listens to Wagner in the basement. - Yes, in the basement! Good. Go on... Go? - Go. - Go. I'm going. You killed him! Idiot! You've ruined me. You and your stupid toys. You've destroyed everything. You're a worthless being... Worthless, like your inventions. You should have died. Yes, you should have died as well! You've never understood. Understood? I should have killed you before. I should have killed you. Killed you! Come on. - It was a monstrous idea. - Sure. She planned everything. Her past, her family, her political beliefs... The investigation I carried out. All conceived in her criminal mind. But I'm a scientist. I invented this machine. An earth populated by pygmies and deformed beings... Mortality is a myth of the past. Iwill make man immortal, with my dynamic technology! I have this power! Sure. You're right. Come... Come with me. Yes, yes. I'm coming.
