♪ Chicago's favorite, wls ♪ This is radio 91.1., chicagoland's number one radio station. I'm shadoe Steele with Chicago's number one news. In Peking today, the chairman of the Chinese communist party, deng xiao peng-- yo, deng, nice name for a dictator-- said that dictatorship must be paved away in China and democracy broadened. President Jimmy Carter reacted to the remarks with caution saying, "we will judge them by their actions, not their words." In California, governor Jerry brown called for "peace in the molecular universe." The so-called "moonbeam governor" is gearing up for a run at the Democratic nomination in 1980. Now some political strategists think it won't be long before there's a wacko Californian in the white house. And it's official, postage stamps will take another hike from 13 cents to 15 cents per stamp. The hikes will be taking effect next week. Our cubbies take on Steve garvey and the L.A. Dodgers at wrigley this afternoon. The sox play the twins in Minneapolis tonight. And finally, the Stanley cup playoffs ended last night. The Montreal Canadians knocked off the Boston bruins 4 to 1 to take the series in 5 games. And now, Chicago's number one radio, 91.1, brings you the number one most requested song of the last hour. ♪ W l s ♪ do a little dance, make a little love ♪ ♪ get down tonight ♪ make a little love ♪ get down tonight ♪ get down tonight Woman: I think you should go!... Sports announcer: Rookie sensation Tom Travis has been simply awesome tonight in the nets. Curt gowdy here. Game 7, Stanley cup finals. And there's no time left we're in a penalty shot situation. If Travis stops it, the game's over. If Jean renoir puts it in, we're into sudden death overtime. He's maneuvering around, he's starting to skate in. He's stick handling, fakes left, goes right, shoots. And...travis saves it! He gloved it! Unbelievable! Who'd have thought a ninth grader from a suburban bantam team could so totally dominate the Stanley cup playoffs. This is unbelievable. Tom. Tom, I'm talking to you. I'm sorry you had to hear that. I hope you know that this has nothing to do with you. It's strictly between your father and me. But I don't wanna go to California. We've already been through this. It ---- Tom, knock that off. You've never even been there. Anyway, maybe the lawyers will settle things quickly and you can come home sooner. Are you all packed? Good. I have to run to the office to get some files. I'll be right back. Hey, Tom. So when do you take off? An hour or so. That's too bad. We were gonna play some street hockey. Sure could use you. If only it wasn't California. It's a stupid place! I hate all their sports teams. But the worst thing is everyone calls you "dude". I hate that. I mean, if California was so great, why does everyone still live in Chicago? Hey, Dave, um-- while I'm gone, can you do me a favor? Can you take dumper to the park maybe once or twice a week? He loves it there. He just goes wild sniffing at all the dogs and stuff. And my mom never has time to take him. Sure. Thanks. Well, I'll see ya. Yeah. Take care. Hey, I think there's only 81 days or something until September. See ya. I'm sure gonna miss you, too, little guy. God, I wish it was September already. This is gonna be the worst summer of my whole life. How're you doing? Fine. Can I get you something? No. A pillow? Ok. Mmmmma! Hi, aunt sunny. Wow, are you ever getting big. Amber, this is your cousin Tom. Well, let's get going. Climb on in, Tom. And this is my other child. Buddha, meet your cousin, Tom. And this is my painting room, where I do a lot of my work, and where I have plans to make you into an artist this summer. This is new. It's peppered okra. And this is pureed green beans from my garden. And this is sliced raw beets. Everything is totally organically grown. Very nutritious. How is it? It's good. Real good. I knew you'd like it. So anyway, thousands and thousands of people come here from San Francisco and Los Angeles to have some fun. Maybe watch the surfing, get a bargain. In just those few days, I can almost make enough money to last till next summer fest. And I figure with you helping me... But I don't know anything about painting. An advantage. Your style won't be sullied by an earlier influence. Come here. Oh, dear. No? You're pretty quiet. It's ok. It's tough going through what you're going through with your parents and all. But you're gonna have a great summer here. Probably the best summer of your whole life. I just know it. ♪ Every time that I look in the mirror ♪ ♪ all these lines in my face getting clearer ♪ ♪ the past is gone Aunt sunny: Stop crying. Where can I get some new batteries?

I mean, I can give you a good deal. Ok, how much? $5.99. They're normally 7 bucks. Heard anything from Bo? Oh, paleeze! He's such a townie. And conceited. God! He's cute. He's rich. He's 16. He's got a car-- ok, ok. He's just not, you know, John Travolta. I don't have enough. And besides, I need to get some batteries, too. Yeah, but I can't go any lower. Girl: Well, what are your plans for the summer? I don't know. I think I'll just get a great tan, read some harlequin romances. Are we pathetic or what? There's a cute guy! Where, where, where? Don't look yet. He is tourist all the way. Looks like--New York-- Boston. Aw, too bad. He's behind you. Oh, god! I know he saw me staring. Oh! I'll tell ya what. I'll let you have the glasses if you can... Help me with my paper route for two mornings this week. What? A paper route? No thanks. And I'll give you the lowdown on the little goddess over there. What's your name? Fin. What's yours? We need to count 'em. Should be 70. Ok, we're done. Now what's her name? Um, you wanna get some java? I hate coffee. Well, they have donuts, too. Come on. What can I get you? Two javas. I hate coffee. You want a donut? I don't have any money on me. You can owe me. Two donuts. Chocolate covered. Uh, do they have coconut on top? No. Good. So doesn't your mom fix you breakfast? My mom? Never. Ok, now. What's this girl's name? You could probably pay me back by helping me sell sunglasses on the pier. Look, what am I, your personal slave? With you helping, it would probably double sales. And you could watch girls all day. Look, maybe I don't want to stay at the beach all day. Let's see, you'll probably need a swimsuit. You have a swimsuit, don't you? Look, you want my coffee? Drink it! Every grown-up drinks java. I don't want this coffee, I don't wanna sell any of your sunglasses, and I don't wanna deliver any of your papers, ok? But you owe me. Your folks are sending out some money, but until then we are really scraping by. Sorry. Are you kidding? It's only $8.50. Well, why don't you return the sunglasses and get your money back? Maybe you can get a paper route if you need some extra cash. Whoo whoo! Whoo! What a kook! You look like a total butt. What now? You look like a goob. Now go put something on that won't scare away my customers. I don't have anything else. Then just take off. Ok. If I take off, I don't owe you a thing. Wrong, dude. You can still help me deliver papers. Look, dude, I'm not a dude. And if I'm not good enough to sell your stupid sunglasses, I'm not good enough to deliver your stupid papers. Ok, ok. Lighten up. Never hire a weenie. I'm surprised you weren't arrested for indecent exposure before. But you've got the rad look now. I hate people who dress like this. You're living at the beach. Go with the flow. How am I gonna pay you back? Just sell sunglasses, lots of sunglasses. What is it? What do you want with all your money? A Van. A ---- vw surfsled. But you can't drive for another two years. One year and 9 months. And when I can, I'm gonna drive the --- Van around. What for? Babes, dude. I mean, you take 'em down the beach a ways or you take 'em up into the hills. What's up in the hills? Nothing. That's why you take them up there. Look, there's this old abandoned gold mine, the superstition mine. Now it's been closed for years but you can still get in. It's real private. Why do you need a Van to get there? You don't need a Van to get there. You can walk there. You need the Van to get the babes to get there. You're so California, it's scary. My aunt sunny says she sells enough paintings during the summer fest that--you know what the summer fest is? Yeah. Ok. That she can live off of them for the rest of the year. Well, yeah, but that's mostly adult stuff. I mean, for us kids, it's the surfing competition. How hard is it to surf? Oh, come on. Don't tell me you're thinking of learning. I mean, it takes a lot of skill and ability. It's just something that comes naturally to Californians. Oh, come on. That's like saying the only good hockey players come from Canada. Wait a second. How many surfing waves have you seen roll up onto the beaches of Illinois? Me? None. Ok. I rest my case. Now clam up. Here comes a customer. You look--real special in those, ma'am. Those pair are $7.99, but-- you look nice. For you, $7.00 even. I'll take them. Well, thank you, ma'am, and--have a nice day. Those sunglasses were supposed to be 6.25. T-man, first rule of business. Charge what the market will bear. Get the hang of it? Yeah, I think so. Good. Take over then. I'm gonna go catch a few and I'll be back in a while. Excuse me. How much are these? Uh--these? They're um--7.99. Nah. Too expensive. But for you, I'll give 'em to you for 7 even. They're selling the same pair up the street for 5 bucks. Are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure. 5 bucks, huh? Ok, 5 bucks. I don't know. I feel like I'm getting ripped off here. $5.00 is cost. That's a really good price. Well, I don't know. Tell you what. I'll give you $4.00 fmr 'e excuse me, I said pay $4.00. 0! Take itor leave it. Leave it! I gotta go! Get a lifeguard! What happened? Are you ok? Oh. Mondo wave, huh? Where's my board? Can somebody get his board? Guess I owe you now. What was that? A little senior lifesaving. Where'd you learn that stuff? Swim leaders. I used to save little squirts from the junior high pool. The wilmette swim program is the best in the state. Geekiest swimsuits in the state, too. Oh, yeah. Yeah, thanks, dude. It's all right, folks. He's ok now. What happened out there? The wave was a lot bigger than I thought. I got too far into it, so when it crashed, it crashed me. What do you mean-- too far into it? Well, underneath it, like the crest. See, you wanna stay in front of the crest or the curl. Like that guy. Well, thanks, dude. Uh, sorry--t-man. Where are you going? One more wave today. Are you nuts? You almost drowned! Yeah, but that's the point. You gotta get back on the horse. Now, spot me, ok? You're crazy! You can never let it beat you! Any problem over here? Not anymore. That guy almost went under. Where were you? Hey, it's a big beach, man. There's a lot of ground to cover. What? A guy almost drowns and there's too much beach for you to cover? Hey, lighten up, man. You got a problem, go talk to my supervisor. Hey, Finley, is that your stuff over there? Yeah? So? Have a safe day at the beach, kids. Hey, wait a minute! Jerk. What's his problem? I beat him the last two years in the surfing contest. The guy has a real attitude problem. Let's call his bluff and go talk to his supervisor. What are you, feeling well? What kind of a person would hire a --- like that? Come on. It can't hurt. Who's watching the sunglasses? What's this? Hurry up. The lifeguard supervisor's office might close. You sold a pair of sunglasses for 4 bucks? You're gonna bankrupt me. He coulda left nothing at all. Besides, I had to run and go save this... Ok, ok! Don't change the subject. Think they'll do anything? It's your word against Joey's. Who do you think they're gonna side with? Just forget about it. Let's go get a malt. Hey, Finley, heard you had a little-- mishap at the beach today. No worse than the mishap on the day you were born. Well, if I were you, I'd be careful. You might have just been lucky today. Oh, I'll keep that in mind. Who is that? It's Bo Riley. Him and Joey the lifeguard are best friends. Oh, god, there he is again! Maybe he's not a tourist. Well, he has to be one of fin's friends. I mean, look how he's dressed. Hey, there are those two girls. Well, no better time than now. Here they come. Hey, guys. How're you doing? Hi, fin. Ok!Hi, fin. Ok! Um--i want you to meet a friend of mine. This is Tom Travis. This is uh--Traci Martin and cari o'Rourke. Hi. Hi. Hi. So, you guys heard of anything going on tonight? Yeah. Bo's having a party. Yeah. It should be fun. Yeah, well-- I guess we'll meet you there. Yeah. Yeah. Ohhh!ohhh! I feel like such an idiot. I couldn't think of anything to say. Fin: Don't worry. Cari: We'll see them tonight. I couldn't think of anything to say.I feel like such a jerk. What was her name again?What was his name again? I can't remember.They are so cute. I know. Cari, I wonder when fin and his friend are gonna get here. I wonder if they can even get in. Trace, isn't it gonna be kinda hard to flirt with this guy right in front of Bo? I've forgotten Bo. There's no way we're gonna pick up again where we left off last summer. I don't know. He's got lots to offer. Unfortunately, he knows it, too. Wow, this guy really is big bucks. Maybe we shouldn't go in there. Pretty rad party, huh? It's ok. You wanna dance? Sure. ♪ I never questioned my own immaturity ♪ ♪ and cool as... What, are you still ---- since I only wrote you once since last summer? Bo, we left off at a dead end. Come on, let's go. I don't wanna go to this party. Ok. Bo... What are you being such a pt for? What's a pt? --- Tease. Bo, you have no p to tease. So just relax, ok? You know, I shoulda wrote to you. I'll never make that mistake again. You wanna clear outta here, take a drive? I'm waiting for someone. Ok. Maybe later. Why didn't you tell me she already has a boyfriend? I didn't know. Well, that's girls for ya. Excuse me, uh-- we left our I.D.S at home. Um--would you mind scoring us some beer? Guess he would mind. Dude, quick! This way. The party must be running out of beer. You plug up the exhaust pipe, and the car blows up. Let's go. Don't come back till you're 21! We lose license! Hey, look dude, just give me a break, all right! Give me my I.D. Back. Don't come back here! Scoundrel. What happened? It didn't work. Just relax, man. Look, the money is on the way. Hey, hey. Come here, worm. Come on, man. Get your hands off me! Now, I can get back some of the coke and part of the hash and that's it. Hey, man. Nobody bogarts me. Nobody bogarts me! I want my percentage plus interest--now. Ok, here's your percentage. Plus interest. Hey, fin. Where'd you go? You tell your little friend that if either one of you says so much as one word to the cops, I'm gonna cut you open and I'm gonna rip out your heart with my bare hands. You got me? You got me?! Yeah. I'm not gonna do anything to him, just you. Do you understand? Do you understand?! Yeah! Sleep tight. Tom! Police arrested rockman. How do you know? They told my dad. He's district attorney. Where'd you go after you ditched into that yard? I went up a tree. Did you hear what he said? Yeah. You didn't go to the police, did you? Are you kidding? We may not have to. Look, if they arrested him, they must have enough evidence to where they may not even need us. Oh, thank god. You can probably put that down now. I went by your house and no one was home. I thought you'd gone to the police and I was dead meat. Nah. Look, I gotta get going, ok. I snuck out. I'll talk to you in the morning. Mm. Pretty gruesome stuff here. "The victim, John doughty, known as dode, "died from a 5 inch deep wound from the stomach to the chest "which punctured the victim's heart. "An unidentified man who was reportedly "the last person to see the victim alive, "is being held in connection with the murder. Police believe the murder may be drug-related." Drugs sure have attracted the wrong element. Back when I was at Berkeley, it was get a little high, peace, love. Now it's do drugs and get your throat cut. I hope you're smart enough not to go near the stuff. I'm expecting a call! Hello. Tom, it's fin. They released him. Lack of evidence, no witnesses. No weapon. And the guy's landlord gave him an alibi. Now, I haven't said nothing yet, but my dad and I are on our way over. That ok? Tom, is that ok? Yeah. Yeah. Bye. Is there something wrong? You didn't see this guy. He's crazy. What if he comes back for me? Look, I really don't think there's too much to worry about. First, if he's around here, they'll catch him. It's too small a town. Second, he's probably off to San Francisco or even L.A. by now. And third, we're gonna keep a patrol car outside both our houses until the whole thing settles back to normal. I could just go back to Chicago. I suppose you could do that. Of course, when he does get caught, which should be very soon, we're going to need you to testify--here. You call right now and have them charge a ticket for you. They'd never forgive me if you got hurt here. Yeah, hello. Is Mr. Travis in? It's his son calling. Two weeks? Where can I reach him? Not until tomorrow. Well, if he calls in, have him call me, ok? Thanks. Are you done yet? The newspaper wants to interview you. And you know what else... Excuse us for a moment. I was talking to cari. She said she and Traci thought the party was a major drag and they were waiting for us to come. I'm serious. We're heroes, and I think she's hot for you. I gotta call my mom. Aunt sunny: You better call your mother...Now. Oh, um, can I talk to her alone? Oh. Sure. Sorry. Woman: Ms. Travis' office. Hello. Is Mrs. Travis in? Who's calling, please? It's her son calling. Please hold. Thank you. Hello? Yes? Ms. Travis is in a meeting with a client now. What is this in reference to? Tell her I need to talk to her. Ok. Hold on. Ms. Travis asked if it's an emergency, or could she call you back tonight? No--it's not an emergency really. I just uh--i just wanted to see how she was doing, that's all. I'll give her the message. Thanks. I'll make sure she gets it. Ok. Bye-bye. Bye. Well? Um--mom said I should probably stay... Because I might have to testify soon. As long as it's ok with you. Well, it's a bit more than I bargained for, but... I suppose. Well, after we jumped him and wailed on him for awhile, uh, he managed to escape and he ran off like a scared rabbit. Weren't you ever afraid? Nah, not really. There was two of us and only one of him. Are you afraid he might come back? Nah. We've got the police. And we're not afraid of a creep like that anyway. If he tries to come in the window, he makes a mess and leaves the perfect footprint for evidence. He'll never expect this. He walks in, trips on the cord, falls on his face. You hear him, you have a bat by your bed... And pow, it's over. Ok, the guy pulls the door open, right? This string, it comes up, pulling the clock out here. The clock starts ringing. The bricks fall down, pulling up the rope, and he's hanging like a side of beef. Now, um, oh, ok. We're gonna need leaves to cover this. Hey, t-man, come here! Is this what I think it is. I'm so tired. That's the trouble with this stuff, man. It just makes me sleepy. I gotta get something to eat. Wait. Stupid thing. Hey, I guess it works! Aunt sunny: Tom! Oh. Oh! Great quiz this month! Is your man macho or a wimp? Who you gonna take it for? Bo or Tom? I already know what Bo is. Which one? Both, macho and a wimp. Oh, meow! And Tom? I don't know. He probably doesn't even like me. Gee, Bo is really excellent. Bo's gotten even better. Where is he? Striped trunks. You don't think Traci's here with him? If her taste in guys is for Bo, she's not worth it. Cari, too. Let's find out. Oh, god, he's coming this way. Act natural. I bet you the first thing he says is about himself. Something conceited. Hey, you guys. Did you see me take that last wave? It was the biggest one all day and I took it perfectly. Hey, can I borrow your towel for a sec? Boy, I cannot wait for the surf contest this year. I'm gonna kick some major butt. Hey, this doesn't look so good. Hey, how you girls doing today? What do you want? Oh, we're not too friendly today, are we? I guess I'll just get right to the point. I think it's only fair to warn you that uh-- Bo's been ---- Traci. Yeah, how would you know? I saw him, down on the beach the other night. Hey, they been going out for more than a year. Yeah, I don't believe it. Hey, see for yourself. And, uh, her little friend o'Rourke-- I've been doing the honors there. And if you don't believe me, Bo and Traci were nearby, same beach, same night. Just thought I'd give you fair warning, guys. They've already been taken, so to speak. Well, ciao. Let's go back. Cari and Traci: Oh, hi, you guys! Too late now. Hi.hi, how're you doing? Haven't seen you out cutting waves much, Finley. Yeah, well, I haven't had much time. Suppose not, showing the town to this hodad from the flatlands. So, heard anything new on rock? Nah, but they'll get him. Sooner or later. What if it's after he's already wasted you? Hi, everybody! Hey, Joey. Hi, Joey. I got some bad news. I just had a talk with the lifeguard supervisor. Seems that we've had some trouble on the beach recently. And he gave me the authority to prevent any unsafe behavior and to remove any troublemakers. Finley, you and your pal here look like you might be troublemakers. So I'm afraid I'm just gonna have to remove you from the beach. Don't worry, we'll be back tomorrow. No, I don't think you understand. I mean permanently. Or at least as long as I'm around. You can't do that! I just did! Yeah, well Traci and cari'll swear we're not causing any trouble. Don't get us in the middle of this little macho thing here. Ok, fine, look. I don't need your stupid beach anyway. Oh, yeah? Where else you gonna practice for the surf contest? My bathtub. That's not the only thing he's gonna practice. Look, Finley, no matter how much you surf, you'll never be as good as the guys who grew up here. So quit trying. Come on, let's go. You guys are so childish sometimes. I caught hell from the supervisor because of them. So I owed it to them. Bo and Joey remind me of everyone from forest Glen. It's this suburb just north of where we live in Chicago. Rich jerks. All their parents are fat cats in mink coats and the kids are all spoiled brats. You don't think Traci and cari really like those guys, do you? They wouldn't even stand up for us. Look, what do you expect, Tom? They're doing it with Bo and Joey. You know what? Girls suck. You just can't trust 'em. Yeah, look, Tom, I gotta get going. All right? You're going surfing, aren't you? Show me how to surf. I wanna learn. Oh, brother! It's not easy. It takes time. And I don't know if there's enough time in the world for me to beat Bo, much less teach you. I can swim. I play hockey and baseball, so I know I can learn fast. I've got something to prove, too. Besides, you'll at least need a spotter. You owe me from when I pulled you out from that undertow. I don't suppose you'd call it even right now if I marked off everything you owe me. ♪ The mountain is high, the valley is low ♪ ♪ and you're confused on which way to go ♪ ♪ so I come here to give you a hand ♪ ♪ and lead you into the promised land ♪ ♪ come on and take a free ride ♪ ♪ free ride ♪ come on and take it by surprise ♪ ♪ come on and take a free ride ♪ ♪ All over the country... ♪ Nobody's willing... ♪ You've gotta do better, it's time to begin ♪ ♪ to know all the answers from somewhere within ♪ ♪ come on and take a free ride ♪ ♪ free ride ♪ Come on and stand here by my side ♪ ♪ come on and take a free ride ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah You make it look so easy! ♪ Ooh ooh ooh ♪ Ooh ooh free ride ♪ Come on and take a free ride ♪ ♪ yeah yeah yeah yeah ♪ come on and take a free ride ♪ ♪ yeah yeah yeah yeah ♪ Come on and take a free ride ♪ ♪ yeah yeah yeah yeah ♪ come on and take a free ride ♪ ♪ yeah yeah yeah yeah... So... What have you been up to all day? Surfing. That's it? Pretty much. Every day? Yep. Every day for the past month? I guess. I don't know what's happening, Tom. Like, whether it's this divorce thing or not. You're up before the crack of dawn. You're gone till dark. You come home for a quick dinner, and then you either go out again or you go straight to bed. We hardly ever see you. Maybe it's this poison you eat. It's not poison. Are you on drugs? No. I talked to your mother today. You never told her about that murder, did you? I tried to tell her, but she was too busy. How do you try to tell someone and then not? She does speak english. Can I go to my room now? You know why you came out here this summer? Do you know the real reason? My parents didn't want me around when they got divorced, and you needed someone to help you paint pictures and baby-sit this little-- I did say that, didn't I? How many pictures have I asked you to paint? None. How many times have I asked you to baby-sit? Once. Once. It's been real tough, hasn't it? You know why you're out here this summer? Because I wanted to help. Because my parents went through a divorce at your age and I always wished someone was there to help me through it. I like you, Tom. You're my favorite nephew. Yeah. Things change. Things always change. I don't know what's happening in this world. Now suddenly, we have the "me" decade and this country's worshipping John Travolta prancing around to disco. It's as if Bob Dylan were never born. Who's Bob Dylan? Can I go to my room now? I suppose. But I want you to start pulling your weight around here, Tom. Now that side fence is in desperate need of a coat of paint. And I just don't have any time to do it right now. But aunt sunny, the surfing competition's in another week. I need to practice! Lord almighty, you haven't done a thing here all summer. Now start tomorrow, and no surfing until it's done. But aunt sunny-- I don't want to hear another word. I have made up my mind. And don't spill any paint on my plants. Who's Bob Dylan. You lay the drop cloth down so you don't get paint on the organic plants. Organic plants. Then you must be careful to evenly coat the whole roller. This is really 21st century technology. Give me that. You missed a spot. Shut up. More colors. Buddha, come here. Come here, puppy. Come on, Buddha. Come here. Yeah! What is going on here? We, uh-- uh-huh, this oughta be a good one. Thought we'd help make some pictures for you to sell at the festival. Help me make some pictures? You thought you'd help memake some pictures? And Buddha thought he'd help, too? I'm sorry, aunt sunny. It was a bad idea. We'll clean everything up and I'll buy you new paints. You think this is how art is created? Just a backyard party? Any wise-ass kids and a dog can do it? Just a second. I actually like that splash of magenta. Wait, wait. No, come on. Where do they go? They don't sell sunglasses anymore since that idiot Joey kicked them off the beach. We've sat around long enough. It's time we do something. Something tacky. Like what? The thing to remember is to be patient. Don't be afraid to wait for a good wave. The stupid surfer will take the first wave he sees. Oh, god. It's time for dinner. My aunt sunny is the worst cook. Well, do you wanna eat at our house? Well, sure. I suppose. Just tell me one thing. I've always wondered. Where did your aunt sunny's kid come from? Well, I heard my parents talking one time. They think it was just some drifter she met. She wasn't getting any younger and... Was afraid of growing old all by herself. She's pretty independent. She doesn't really care what other people think. She's sorta cool that way. Oh, boy, leftovers. Hey, fin, where's your mom? Your parents divorced or something? Hi, guys. Oh, hi, dad. Hi, Mr. Finley. Well, fin, Tom asked you a question. No, uh, we're not divorced. Charles' mother and little sister were killed in a car accident about 3 years ago. I'm sorry. Don't be sorry. Of course if I... Could change things back... But you can't let it beat you. So things are just-- different. We moved here, I got a new job. Fin's going to a new school. Don't feel sorry for us. On a happier note, i--heard some reasonably good news today. A Texas ranger called. He thinks he saw our drug friend, rockman, somewhere outside Dallas. Did they catch him? No. The ranger didn't make the description until after the guy was gone. But--at least that means old rockman isn't around here. So Tom, you wanna stay for dinner? Uh--i wish I could. But uh--i just remembered my aunt sunny's cooking something real special tonight. Oh, really. What is it? It's a surprise. It almost always is. That's a lot of shaving cream. I know. Finally gonna do something about all that gross leg hair. A lot of toilet paper. Could you please hurry? I really have to go. They judge you for challenge, which means how big the wave is, and style, which means how bodaciously you ride it. I don't know if it was worth it. What do you mean? Learning to surf. I'm still not very good. Oh, you're high. I mean, you're doing real decent. I'm actually pretty amazed. I've never been much good at anything. Except being goalie and maybe swimming. Sometimes I think if only I'd gotten better grades or hadn't been such a pain in the ---, my parents wouldn't be doing what they're doing. I don't know. It's not your fault. Well then whose is it? Sometimes nobody's. I mean, you can mope around and mope around until you get sick of it. But then you gotta get on with things. Look, it's like surfing. The waves just keep coming and you can't control it. Sometimes it feels like you're on a cloud. But sometimes they crash you. What did you write? Finn has a cute butt? God, you can't say that. What did you write over here? Tom is a boy? I told you to call him something mean. It was the worst thing I could think of. Here. There. Much better. I was hoping to take home a prize in the surf contest. Oh, come on. You didn't think you could beat Bo, did you? I don't know. I just wanted to show them. Meaning Traci? I know about her kind. She's just like all the forest Glen girls. Last winter, I was first string goalie on the wilmette bantam team, and I started going out with this forest Glen girl. Then I hurt my foot and I couldn't play for, like, two weeks. She wouldn't go out with me until I was starting again. That's a forest Glen girl. You are totally high. I mean, she's a cool girl. It's just that she likes Bo. Thatmakes her uncool. Here, we each have one more roll of t.P. Then let's go. Tom. Wait. Wait. Quiet. Aaahhhhh! Girls: Aaaahhh! Traci: All right, all right, I give up! What are you doing here? Doing where? What are you doing here? Fin: Tom, look at this. Tom is a gross boy? That's a real good one, guys. We were just walking by. Now let us go. Yeah, well, why don't you go t.P. Your boyfriend's house? Shut up, cari.We sorta thought we were. What about Bo and Joey? I haven't gone out with him since last summer. What did Joey say? And you haven't been going out with Joey? Joey who? But... We've got some tables to turn. Are you sure this will even things up? Don't worry. After tomorrow, we'll all feel much better. You ready? Yep. I hope this works. Hi. Hiya, guys. Haven't seen you in awhile. How're you doing? Doing ok. How're you guys doing? Do you guys feel like ice cream? Sure. Why not? You guys'll have to go get it, 'cause, uh, I'm on duty. All right? Oh, cari and I will go get it. Ready to drown? I guess so. I've actually had some real life experience doing this. Get your head down. Hey, a guy's drowning! Go get the lifeguard! Hey, this guy's drowning! Help! Get your head down. Help! Help! Let's go! My station! What about the drowning kid? Screw him, man! My station just fell over! Worked like a charm. Radical, man. Totally radical. That was excellent. You're right, I do feel much better today. Yeah, well, what about Bo? We still owe him. Well, I'll think of something. Imitating Howard cosell] This is Howard cosell at the international surfing competition. Ooh! Look at Tom Travis rip. He's literally dancing on the wave. Aaahhh! Hey, you little monkey. You gonna come watch and bring me luck? Can I have some luck? Ok, champ, let's load up. That'll be plenty for now, Tom. Thanks. All right. Look, sid. Come on. Ok. Hey, interesting. Sunny: Isn't it? It's by a new French artist who's out here spending the summer. And a New York critic told me he thinks this could be the next Jackson pollack. What a statement of color! Yeah, it'll look good by the hot tub. How much can you come down in price? Well, this one's $1,200. But if you're interested in several by this artist, I'm sure we could work something out. Gerry and Judy will simply turn green when they see these. What else you got here? This. Isn't that startling? Ooh, I love this one! It's cheap. Fin: Hey, Tom. Good luck, Tom. Merci. All entrants in the junior category. All entrants in the junior category. Please report to the scorers' table to register. First prize in the junior category is $1,000. Second prize is $500. And third price is $250. Due to the number of interference problems encountered last year in the junior category, Tom Travis.We are adopting some slightly different rules this year. You will each be assigned a color. We will wave the color and sound a horn to indicate whose turn it is to surf. Wave to the judges to indicate that you are ready. Remember, you'll be disqualified if you surf out of turn. In addition to that, because of the number of safety problems posed by surfers losing their boards, everyone will be penalized 15 points if you surf without a leash. Also, you'll have 90 seconds from the time we blow the horn for you to catch a wave. Today, that should give you anywhere from 5 to 7 waves to choose from. Any questions? Ok. Good luck. ♪ Ride ♪ ride my seesaw ♪ take this place on this trip ♪ ♪ just for me ♪ ride ♪ take a free ride ♪ take my place, have a seat ♪ ♪ it's for real ♪ I worked like a slave for years ♪ ♪ spent some time just to end my fears ♪ ♪ not to wait for my life to go bad ♪ ♪ I know, I know, I should have rode ♪ After much deliberation, the judges have reached a decision on the top 5 finishers who will go on to the final round.

But just remember, don't save anything. Now, stay by me. The waves are breaking best at this one spot. Mongo Andrews will surf first. Well, this is it. Yeah, this is the spot.

The next surfer is Charles Finley. What are you waiting for? Too small. Too small? Nothing's too small for a short hitter like you. Look...concentrate, fin. Oh, you're a good cheerleader. Too small. Next one, next one, next one! Judge: Good work, Charles. So, I heard you had something to do with Joey's lifeguard station coming down yesterday. Yeah? Where'd you hear that? Small world. People see things. Word gets around. You know, you shouldn't stay so close to other surfers. Might get yourself in trouble. Judges can't see everything. Next contestant is Tom Travis. What the...? Wait for the next one. Uh, nice ride, but we have some penalties here. Tom Travis will be penalized 15 points for interference as well as 15 points for unsportsmanlike conduct. Next contestant is Bo Riley. What happened? Bo. He grabbed my leash through the wave. I hope he breaks his neck. Well, tell the judges. Well, it's just his word against mine. Who do you think they'll side with? Pretty small wave. No challenge points. We'll have our final point tallies shortly. No, it was my fault. I told you to stay where the best break was. I should have known Bo would be there, too. But let's go to the judges anyway. You go. Sorry, Tom. We were rooting for ya. Thanks. Will the following contestants please report to the judges' stand-- Bo Riley and...Tom Travis. What now? Judge: All right, now, I want to hear from both of you what went on out there. You first. Tell 'em, Tom. Look, he doesn't need your help. What happened out there? That guy reached underwater and grabbed his safety leash. That is a complete lie. You'll get your chance. Go on. Well, it made Tom here fall. Yeah? So he punched him. Ok, now you. Well, I was waiting for my turn to surf, minding my own business, when out of the blue this punk tries to punch me. I don't know what his problem is. Judge: Ok, fine, thank you. Now we'll have to make a decision. We'll be posting final scores shortly. At least maybe you can win something. Good surfing, you guys. Yeah, good luck. Thanks.thanks. Judge: We've had a correction in this unfortunate penalty situation. Tom Travis will be penalized only 15 points for unsportsmanlike conduct. Bo Riley will be deducted 15 points for interference and an additional 15 points for unsportsmanlike conduct. Hey, relax man. You'll still win. Judge: And now here are the award winners. Third prize with 132 challenge points and 125 style points for a total score of 257 is Mark kusick. Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Second prize, with 140 challenge points and 119 style points for a total score of 259 is mongo Andrews. And first prize, with 131 challenge points and 138 style points for a total score of 269 is Charles Finley! Yeah! You did it! After subtracting penalty points, the fourth place finisher is Tom Travis and fifth place goes to Bo Riley. Yeah! You beat him. You can't believe him. He's not even from around here. Besides, you gotta give me a second chance. That was a ridiculous wave. You saw how small mine was. Yeah, we all saw how... Small yours is. Hey, it's a small world. People see things. Word gets around. The judges' decisions are final. We both beat Bo. He actually got more points than me. Well, yeah, but the thing to remember is Bo felt he had to cheat to beat you. And they only remember the final score and you beat him. Hello? Hey, how you doing. It's your mom. Good, good. No, everything's fine here. Yeah, Tom's gloating over beating the town bully and former surfing champ in the surfing competition. Yeah. Well, wait a minute, no, I'll let you talk to him. Ok, here. Hi...yeah. Yeah, it was no big deal, though. Just 16 and under. Mrs. Travis: Still that's great. Just great. Well, I've got some good news... Actually some good news and some bad news. All the legal proceedings have been settled between your father and me. Uh-huh. And as a result, well, I sold the old house and we've got a brand new condominium. What? It's at highland Avenue at green bay road. It's got a pool and-- that's in forest Glen, isn't it? I don't have to change schools, do I? Forest Glen has a much better school system, and I understand their hockey team is better, too. Tom?...are you there? Yeah. Well, that's the good news. The bad news is... Well, unfortunately, the new condo doesn't allow dogs. I'm sorry. I know it's not an easy thing, but dumper's out with a very nice family on a big farm out in fox valley. He'd be much happier there than cramped up in a condo all day. You know that, Tom, don't you? Honey? I'm not going back that's it. Can I stay at your house, maybe start school here? That wouldn't look good. I mean, the d.A. Harboring a missing kid? Uncool. Where else can I go? It doesn't have to be your house. Maybe the beach. Nah. Not with Bo and the lifeguards here. What about down by our cove? No, the tide comes in, and what would you do if it got cool or started to rain? I'm not moving to forest Glen. She shoulda just as well said Siberia. Living in a condo? No dumper? What about the mine? The superstition gold mine? Well, at least for a little while till we can find someplace better. It just might work. The breakfast of champions. Shhh. Come on. Wait, I want to stop and see Traci. What do ya mean? You wanna get caught? I just wanna see her. She's gonna want to come along, too. Well, what's wrong with that? The problem is there aren't enough fruit loops. She'll bring cari along, too. Well...let's go. Fin: This is the bad entrance. They dynamited this one to keep the people out. There's a better one up this way, but, uh, we should probably leave our bikes here. Fin: Look at you loners. Cari: Hold on, fin. Hurry up. Ahhh! God! Quit it, you cretin. Ah, this is the main shaft. We should probably leave a candle somewhere to Mark our path. We should set up camp here. How many tunnels are there? I'm not sure. I've explored in here a lot, but, uh, I've heard these tunnels go on for miles... Unless they've caved in. It's creepy down here. It's too quiet. I want to go back up. Oh, real brave, cari. I don't care. I'm claustrophobic. Can we go back up, fin? Uh, sure, yeah, I'll take her back up and, uh, you guys can explore a little. So, uh, why don't we look around some? Ok. Which one? That one. Here, we'll leave a candle here to Mark our path so we can get back. Ooh, glad I'm out of there. It's gross. So now what do we do? Just wait? We could play Blackjack. Oh, I don't know how. Oh, it's easy. The object is to get 21 or as close-- I'm horrible at math. Well, how about...Hearts? I don't know that either. How about...Old maid? Bo-ring. Tom: Wow, this is really cool. Let's go down here. It looks like it goes down further. I'll take 3. Ok, I open. I'll bet you my thongs. I'll bet you my underwear and I'll raise you one "truth or dare". What?! You can't bet a "truth or dare". Sure I can. Just 'cause I've run out of clothes I can still bet and I raise you one "truth or dare". Ok, ok, fine. I'll see your one "truth or dare" and raise you my shirt and bra. That's worth at least 2 "truth or dares". Now we're talkin'. What do you have? Hope you brought the suntan oil-- 4 queens, Ace high. What?! 4 queens?! I have 3 queens and 2 fives. What do you mean, 7 queens in this deck, you little cheater? Cheater? Me? Fin, don't, I'm ticklish! Ah! We've gone pretty far. Shouldn't we go back? No, this is fun. Besides, we've still got a few more candles to Mark our path. It's getting chilly. You want my sweater? I'm not cold. No, that's ok. No, seriously, I don't mind. What time is it? Don't you have a watch? Well, you won it from me. Oh...oh... It's 12:30. You know, maybe we'd better look for Tom and Traci. Fin, in singsong voice: Hello? Here we come. Yoo-hoo! You guys! Ready or not! Tom? Traci? Where are you guys? Ok, I think they're trying to trick us. You guys, we're onto you. It's not funny anymore. Maybe we should go back. We've been gone awhile. Things were just getting good. Well, kerosene's running low anyway. We'll just save it and use more candles. But you've only got one left. Yeah, but we'll collect the others we left on the way back. Come on. See? Now you've got one, too. What was that?! Probably just some water dripping down somewhere. It sounded like a footstep. Cut it out. You're imagining things. Fin: Tom! Traci! Where are you guys? Why haven't they come back? It's been more than 4 hours. Maybe they got lost or had a cave-in. Maybe one of them fell and got hurt. Fin, let's go get help. Tom, come on. Fin, this is really weird. I feel like we're being watched or something. Jeez. Tom is gonna kill me for this, but let's go back up. You can wait by the exit for someone to come out and I'll go to town and get some help. All right, I know I left a candle burning here. Where is it? Maybe it burned down already. Maybe there's just a pile of wax. Where is it? Well, maybe it blew out or tipped over. Here's the match. I don't get it. I do. This has fin's name written all over it. They've probably been following us around picking up our candles and they're gonna ambush us or something stupid. Oh, fin, cari, we're in on your dumb joke. Tom, how are we gonna get out of here? I don't need candles. I know the way out. We took, um...This tunnel. Come on. Tom, I don't remember this part. Shhh. I'm trying to figure this out. And maybe we can hear fin and cari. They're probably looking for us by now. Somebody's been partying down here. Look. Looks like it must have been dynamited. What's that? That's fin. Ok, we're onto you. You can come out now, you butthead. I told you that I'd find you. You made it easy for me. Now I'm gonna have to drive this pick... Through your skull. Fin said they used dynamite to block the main entrance of this mine, right? Well, this looks like it's it, and if we could get through to the other side that would be where our stuff is and we can get out. You killed him. Let's get out of here. Fin: Tom! Traci! Hear that? Fin! Cari! I can hear 'em. We're coming! Traci! Tom! Traci! We're here. Are you two all right? Cari: Traci, where were you guys? Fin: We've been looking all over for you. What happened? Rockman... He's back there. I'm sorry this is taking so long but I want to get all of this taken care of while it's still fresh. Ok, there's your statement. It's all typed up. If you'll sign there at the "x". How much longer? Not much. Now that we're finished with all the official stuff, I, uh...I wanted to talk to you. Unofficially... Fin told me about why you're running away and I...I guess I can't blame you much. But a lot of things that happen can make a Mark on your life whether you like it or not. See, what I'm trying to tell you is that you gotta carry on and carry on the best way you can because lousy things happen to everybody. You just... You know, fin--he would never tell you this, but you're the best friend he's ever had, and your aunt sunny-- she says you've been a fantastic kid this summer. And you've been a hero in this town. But now I think it's time that you go back where you belong, with your parents, because you can't just run away from things. Look at rockman; he's been running away his whole life. Look where it got him. But if your only choice is that abandoned gold mine, then...you're welcome to stay with us. Anytime. Thanks, Mr. Finley. Would it be ok if I just, um... Walked back? Under the circumstances-- I'm not going anywhere. Honest. It's not that far. It's too early in the morning to get into trouble, anyway. It's against my better judgment, but... Keep it. I'll pick it up later. Tom: You're crazy. Fin: You can never let it beat you! They sure kept you there long enough. They thought I'd be going back to Chicago today, so they just wanted to get everything done. Are you? Am I what? Leaving? M-Mr. Finley was saying that, um, you know, sometimes the way things happen... Aren't always fair and, um... And sometimes things aren't always fair but, uh, you just gotta go on. Or something like that. So, yeah...I'm going. Your mom called about an hour ago. I... I didn't have the heart to tell her what happened. I saved that for you. She said she wasn't able to back out of the sales agreement on the forest Glen condo but she was able to get dumper back. Dumper's back? You hear that, Buddha? Yeah, you'd like ol' dumper, wouldn't ya? He's just as stinky as you are. You know what? You were right. I did have a great summer. Thanks aunt sunny... For everything. I'm so glad you came out. I, uh...I got you something. You'll like him. Anyway, you're welcome here next summer, too, and I hope everything works out ok with your school and all. And here's Buddha's going away present. You can pass it on to dumper. You hang in there, kid. Thanks, Mr. Finley. You'll do just fine. Tom...bye-bye. I owe ya half the reward money. That's ok. It's no big deal. No, as soon as I get it, I'll send it to you. I'll miss you. I'll miss you, too. I'll write. So will I. Here... Read it later. Hey, hey, enough of that stuff, all right? Here, I, uh, got you something to remember us by... Dude. Thanks...dude. Take care. You too. Hey, I figured it out. There's only 284 days until next summer. How are you doing? Fine.
