How big is yours? Soft or hard? Hard. I don't know. Last time I checked it was like 6 inches, but that was in like seventh grade so it probably grew. Oh. It's probably more like 7 now, maybe even 8. Do you wanna measure it now? I'm not hard. Oh. Are you? No. How big are you? Like six-and-a-half... That's cool. Not bad. Hey, is Emily coming to the party? Yeah, I think so. I'm so gonna have a boner. I jerk off thinking about her like every day. - Yeah, me too. - Jon is so freakin' lucky. Would you do her? Are you seriously asking me that question? Yeah. Um, YEAH. How would you do it? What would you say? What do you mean? Like, if she was here right now, what would you say to her? - Is she naked yet? - No, not yet. Well, I'd probably like make out with her some and be like, "You are so beautiful." And then -I'd take her shirt off and, uh- -What about yours? Yeah, I'd take my shirt off and then hers and then, and then our pants- So is she naked yet or does she still have her bra on? No, she still has her bra and panties on or whatever. Yeah, I still have my boxers on or whatever. And I like lay down on the bed with her and start kissing her and stuff- And then she takes your boxers off? Yeah, and then I help her take her bra off and her tits are like legendary, you know? What are you saying? Nothing, she's just like moaning a little bit. And then what? Then I like take her panties off and her like vagina is wet or whatever- And you're like really hard? And I'm hard as a freaking rock. Um... - What? - Do you want me to get a sock? What do you mean? -I mean, if you're gonna- -Oh, dude, no, I mean, I don't wanna mess up one of your socks. I'll get dirty ones. - Don't look. - Oh okay. So I'm like kissing up her body and stuff and I'm like, "How do you want it?" And she's like take me from behind. Yeah? And I start like, she turns around and I start pounding her and she's like, "Oh, yeah, harder, harder, do me harder." And I'm like, "You like that baby?" And she's like, "Oh yeah, I really like that." Yeah... Are you thinking about her now? Yeah. Are you about to cum? - Yeah. - Me, too. Oh, I listened to your podcast. Thanks. I really liked it, uh... I bought that Slivers album. - Oh, yeah? Did you like it? - Yeah, it's sweet. Good, it's really good. It's not as good as their first album, but they're a really good band. You ever thought about like, reviewing any Christian bands on there? I do sometimes, but most of it sucks. I don't know, I kinda like it. Oh, yeah, I forgot, we're gonna have to listen to this all night. Sorry. It'll get softer, I put some classical on there. Oh boy, can't wait. Oh, hey, happy birthday, man. Hey thanks. It's actually not 'til 10:02 AM. Night, man. Night. Dear God, thank you for blessing this day. Please help tomorrow to be fun and thank you for everyone in my life who will be here.

We should get coffee tomorrow before church. Maybe. I have to work out at 8:30, so I was thinking maybe 9. I'll let you know. Yeah, yeah. Hi. Hi.

I don't know why these girls need to wear so little. Yeah. Does seem like they're getting skimpier. I mean, I have a two-piece, but- You have a two-piece? -Yeah, but- -My word, Candice. It's pretty modest. I hear you're pregnant, that is wonderful. Thank you. I was thinking about getting in there. No, you don't wanna do that. Candice, sweetheart, are you familiar with this major problem of sex trafficking that's going on? - No? - Um mmm. Alright, I'm just gonna throw these on the grill, unless you uh... You alright? Yeah. Are you okay? Yeah, good. Just, a lot on my mind. Yeah. It's nice having the family back home, though. Yeah, it is. Hey. You look pretty. Thank you. Anything I can do? No no, just enjoy yourself. Are you sure? If you'd like to slice that cheese over there, that'd be- No no, we don't have to make her do that. - She asked, if she'd like to... - Happy to. Believe it or not, Bob, some people enjoy serving. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you? Hal Okay. Hey, Kathleen. Welcome. Thank you so much for inviting us. I just hate intruding on Henry's birthday party. Oh, don't be silly. Hi Ricky, how ya doing? I'm alright thanks. - I hope it's okay I came. - Of course it is. Who's that beautiful lady and handsome man? Oh, Bob. How ya doin' there, buddy? I'm alright, Pastor, thanks. I don't know if this is allowed, but I brought some wine. Shhh. Don't tell anyone. Okay well, I'm not sure we'll be able to bring that out, but thank you for bringing it. Well maybe I can sneak some in somewhere. Okay, sure- There are four bottles in here. Four, really? In that one box? That's incredible. Come on in. Oh, hey Mom. Hey, girls, what are you doing? I'm swimming. She's being a prude. Oh my gosh, just because I don't wanna swim doesn't mean I'm a prude. Hey, Ricky, how's it going? I'm doing great. Is it true he tried to kill himself? They're not sure what happened. Hi. I'm Cheyenne. Let's get this party started, huh? - Rose, dear, how nice. - Hi sweetheart. So good to see you. Oh, hi honey. Oh, Gracie, don't get up. Rose, you look so beautiful, it's good to see you. Guess who's pregnant? Oh, praise the Lord, that's fabulous! Oh, we're going to have something to look forward to. - I know, don't we. - We are gonna have fun. Oh! - You okay, Logan? - You alright? Yeah, I'm alright. Sorry, Logan. It's fine. Did he hit his head? Oh, uh, I put the "medicine" underneath the sink, just so you know. Thank you, dear. Oh, HB always enjoyed the gatherings with the young people. He sure did. Young people who loved the Lord, he sure did appreciate that. Yes, ma'am. I miss him, Bob. I really do. I know. I do, too. I'm sorry to interrupt. We're just gonna self-serve everything, right? Yeah, I think that's best. You know, HB so did treasure you. So appreciated your help. He was a wonderful man. I had some seasonings here somewhere, but I don't know... where'd I put them? Sweet girl. Oh, I'm getting somber. Where's my Ricky? Oh, there he is. How's he been doing, Rose? Oh, you know, he has his good days and his bad days. Thank goodness for these kids, though. He just marks his days by these youth activities. - Hey. - Hey. How's your head? It looked like a... a pretty bad bang. It's fine. Hey, Autumn. Oh, hey, Grace. I'm sorry, I must have slipped past you earlier. That's alright. I didn't mean to interrupt your reading. Oh, no, it's just a stupid magazine. You gonna swim? I don't know. Thinkin' about it. Yeah, me, too. You should. It's a nice day for it. Mom hates swimming. I'm not a big swimmer, either, actually. No, I mean, she hates swimming. Like, the whole idea of it. Why? I don't know. All those bodies I guess bother her. Hm. So apparently Lucy and Stephen are doing it. Hard. No way. Yeah, but who's doing it soft? That's like, the word in the halls, but... Anyway. Did y'all hear about Kevin and Jamayia? What about 'em? Kevin Reynolds? Yeah. So, apparently they had sex on the band trip. Wait, they're gay? Yeah. Tyler Collins came up from the lobby and he saw them in the hotel room, like, doing it. Oh my God. Yeah. Weird. Weird? I'm gay. Wait, what? Seriously? How did you not know this? I don't know these things! Wait, wait, so do you have like a problem with it? Surely you don't. Wait, what does that mean? Lo, are you okay?! Yeah. News flash, sucker. Hey, how's that head? Um, it's not too bad. I'm fine. Please stop asking. Sorry about that, bud. Hey, you got 'til Wednesday to sign up for camp, do your folks know? Yeah, I think so. You gonna go this year? I don't know. We'd love to have you. Gonna be even better than last year. Who's going? Pretty much everyone here, I believe. Gabe's going, Emily's going, Jon's going, still trying to get Coop to come. Cool. Also was curious if you'd be interested in teaching Sunday School sometime. Hoping to kinda move through the whole youth group, get everybody doing it. Oh, I don't know. You can pick any topic that you want. Except homosexuality, I've got that one. And I have vanity. Yeah you do. So how much do you love Columbia Christian? I mean, I'm still figuring it all out, but yeah, I like it. Yeah. My cousin's brother goes there and he totally loves it. You're psych and bio, right? Yeah. So, how exactly does that work? What do you mean? Like, biology at a Christian school. Do they... do they teach evolution, or...? Um... well. You can teach biology without teaching evolution. Yeah, you can also teach math without numbers. Yeah, it's called Logic. My cousin's brother took it. So, when exactly do they teach you that life began? I mean, they do sort of- Skirt around things? Yeah, I mean, it's a little weird, I admit, but, - I just focus on my... - No, it's not weird. That school's awesome, don't listen to them. I mean, I'm able to think for myself, you know? Yeah, good. Do. Hey guys. Yeah, join us. - Yeah. - Hey Ricky. Hey, Happy birthday. I wasn't able to talk to you earlier, you were in the pool. Oh, thanks. Hey, Coop. Rickster, what's going on? You guys ready for camp in a couple weeks? Yeah, we were just talking about that. Trying to get Coop here to come. Yeah, you really should. It's gonna be awesome. Totally. I don't know, I'm not really a camp kinda guy. You going, Ricky? If Keith'll have me back. Yeah, we're still trying to figure out the chaperone situation. We usually have a great time, though. That's mine. Oh, I'm sorry. And so these women are virtually kidnapped off the streets, young girls kidnapped out of their bedrooms - and then sold into being sex slaves, and this is happening right here in America. And there's this wonderful organization called Into His Arms that I really think King's Peace should get involved with and I know that Larry wants to talk to Bob about that because I mean it is a crisis. And so few people are talking about this worldwide crisis. My word. Oh, and then of course there's pornography. I was w... I was watching this TV show the other night about the adult entertainment industry and these girls and boys are 18, 19, 20 years old, and not much older than these kids right here, and they are getting up every morning and going to work, and having sex with hundreds of men, day in and day out, every day, in the most degrading, horrible ways imaginable... I missed the ketchup. - I'll get you some, sweetheart. - No, I'll get it. Are you sure? Yeah. I don't know, sometimes, when I look at our American sexual condition, I just know the Lord is coming. I did not know anything about this, Bonnie. I think, Bonnie, at least for some of these women, it's more of an economic issue than a sexual one. I don't follow. Well, I mean, with any societal problem you have to look at where it begins, and it seems to me these women end up in prostitution, starting somewhere else, whether it be economic hardship, or lack of educational opportunities. Or inadequate sex education. You're not going Democrat on us, are ya? Barbara print out those programs for tomorrow? She did, I saw them over at the office when I was there earlier. Good. Who's doing opening announcements tomorrow, is that me? - If you don't mind. - No, not at all. I'm sure looking forward to the First Corinthians series this fall, by the way. Sick of the Old Testament? No, now, I didn't say that. Just looking forward to the New. I heard that. Oh no, you're doing a great job. I'm liking this series, as well. Well, thank you. I always feel like I could prep better, but- Nah, you're doing a great job, as always. You know who'd be proud of you? Mr. HB. Well, thank you. I know it's been hard, losing a mentor like that. Yeah. Thanks. We don't have to talk about it. No no no, it's fine. That cancer, it's a scary thing, I'll tell you that. Yeah. And he was a young man. I mean, relatively speaking. Good-looking man, good health. Can't see it coming. - You never know. - No, you never do. - Okay, here we go. - We should probably change this. Hey, Coop. We're trying to change this thing, it's filthy. - I think it's the input. - I think it's source. There it is. There it is. There we go. We gotta get rid of these movie channels, I don't know why we still have them. You know, I don't know how she's doing it, but, Kat gets better looking by the day. I wouldn't have thought that possible 'cause it sure hasn't happened to Bonnie. - Not yet, anyway. - Yeah, well. Thank you. She's a lovely person, for sure. Delicious. I never know where the garbage can is- Oh, you know what, it's under the sink. Oh. Hey Bob! What? What's this under the sink? Oh, no no no, that's... Rose brought that. She doesn't know we don't drink. Oh, alright. Why, do you? Oh, you know, on occasion. Ah. You know, Jesus drank. Okay, I don't think I can do this. I'm already starting to feel it. Oh, it'll take me a while to feel it. Oh, shoot, we have to do cake. Do you think it'd be alright if I took this out with me? Um... I mean, I won't if you're not comfortable with it. No no no, it's fine, sure. - Fine. - Cool. Do you like him? Yeah. It's perfect. Thank you so much. You're officially a hipster. Like, it's a thing now. Wait, this is- The first movie we ever watched together. Thank you so much. You're the best. Thank you. I know. Feels like a book. Otherworldly: A Guide to Becoming a Man of Christ. Thank you so much. That's amazing. I appreciate it. Of course. You're the best. Oh, that one's mine. Oh, great. Oh, wow. That's really cool. My Mom found it scuba diving in Costa Rica. It's awesome, thank you, it's great. I really like it. Oh, come on, give him a hug or something. Yeah, come on, what are you doing? Thank you. - You're welcome. - Thanks. Uh, okay, what's next? You can open mine next. I believe you'll enjoy it. No, actually, you know what, maybe save that for later. Oh. What is going on back here? Oh, um... we've got some medicine. Oh! - Sorry... Aaron. - Mrs. Gamble. - Gosh, you surprised me. - Sorry. I-, the back door was open, I hope you don't mind. No, I don't mind. Autumn's out back, she'll be... surprised to see you. Back in the pool! Do you want me to turn the music back on? Yeah, could you put on Mix B, please? - Um... Sure. - You okay, Daddy? Larry, what is in that cup? Oh, hi, Aaron. What are you doing here? What do you mean? You weren't invited. You're not Henry's friend, you're not my friend, what are you doing here? I just came by to say hey. Since when are we not friends? Autumn, Autumn, what the hell are you doing? - Get off me! - Okay, Okay! - Help! - Alright, I'm off! I'm off. What the hell? You're gonna get me shot! Stop invading my house! Invading your house? Okay, um. Can we just... can we just retrace our steps here. Just, for my own memory. Because I... Before you went to school I'm pretty sure we met up and everything was fine. And, and... we talked about how we weren't going to get back together, just gonna stay friends, but... I mean, do you not remember that? You texted me. We had lunch. You texted me three weeks ago, that you were home. I didn't mean it. Okay, what do you mean? What's wrong with you? NOTHING'S WRONG WITH ME, - DAMMIT AARON! - Ow! Jesus! Well then what is it? I don't get it. Think about it, Aaron. You took something from me. Wait, seriously? This is about that? You... you made me feel... I made you feel what? - I thought it was kinda nice. - It wasn't nice, it was... What? It was what?! It was... it was... it wasn't nice... it was awful... the way you- The way I what, Autumn? We both did it, it was our decision. Am I wrong? Did we not make the decision together? Stop it! Stop, please. Please stop! -Hey, come here- -Get off of me! I just wanna go back to my brother's birthday party. Stop talking to me. What are we even doing? I don't have a fucking clue! HOW'S MODELING?! What?! Hi. Hi. Did you like that? Yeah. Henry, I just, I wanted you to know that... I would be totally willing to, like... date you. If you wanted to get serious about this. I mean, I've been really into you ever since we were prayer partners. Could I, um... get back to you? Sweetheart, where'd you go? I ran down the street for no reason, he chased me and now I'm back. Hey. It's okay... hey. You want some wine? Hey, Bob. Hey, Ricky. How you doin'? Doing alright, doing alright. Hey, Keith was saying you guys weren't quite sure about the chaperone situation for camp yet. Uh huh... So I didn't know if... I mean, if something had... You know what, we should just sit down next week and talk about what might be best. Oh. Okay? Okay. I think we got Ricky all worked up. What does that mean? Well, we're not sure if it's best for him to chaperone camp this year. Oh, why, 'cause of the pill incident? Well- To be honest, I'm not convinced it was suicide, I think the guy just likes his pills. Well, I don't know. And then there was the incident at camp last year. What happened at camp last year? Oh. I thought you- What are we talkin' about here? I think maybe now's not the time. No no no no, come on. What happened? I guess there was a situation in the showers. What kind of situation? Well, according to a couple of our guys, Ricky had a, um... he was showering with a couple of the boys and they thought that it seemed like he may have been aroused. - Oh boy. - Yeah, so... Man sure are a lot of stories. That plane ride just about did me in- Why? Well, you're on the plane for about six-and-a-half hours. Oh my goodness, I'm crying. Why? - I don't know... - Mom...? I'll... I'm sorry... excuse me... You know, the trouble with growing up is that you're always... always becoming yourself. You think you're grown up, your body has reached it's peak, but you're still... becoming. You're never actually ready. You never actually... arrive. Why is that trouble? Because you have children. Autumn, I want to... apologize to you- - No, Mom. - No, no I do. I do. Just listen. I want to apologize to you if I ever made you ashamed of your body. What? What do you mean? - You didn't. - No, no, I did. And I'm sorry. Tell me it's okay. It's okay. Listen, Autumn, I wanna be honest with you. Something happened to me recently. Or, a little while ago. Actually, it was a series of... Something happened to me and... I'm not sure what I'm becoming. - Bob? - One second! It's Ricky. Uh, could I speak with you for a minute? Yeah, I'll be right with you, I'm just taking care of something I forgot. You should tell me the next time they do that to you. - It's alright. - No, it's not alright. They're a bunch of assholes. Yeah, I don't know. I do. Can't you just go through the B wing to get to library? Maybe you should just try that. Yeah, I guess, maybe. It's the end of the year, anyway. I think you can. Hey. It gets better. Okay, no, like seriously! It does. Like, I really think it's gonna get better for us. Hey Grace, you seen Ricky? He was looking for me? No, sorry. Do you remember when I used to go over and sit with Mr. Matthews when Rose needed to run errands? Ricky was still working at Best Buy, and she needed some help. Um, yeah, I think so. It was before he went into the hospital for his last round of treatments, before you started school. Oh, okay, yeah. He was very sick, but not so sick that he couldn't enjoy... the time spent. Yeah. And at that point your father had spent more time with him than I had. But sitting with him... we just got along so well. He was... an utter delight. Anyway, one point, a couple of weeks in, -Mr. Matthews- -You can call him HB. No I can't. One day, he was looking at me funny and he said, "My goodness, you could've been a movie star." And, you know, he was a very handsome man, even at the end. He was. I guess I was flattered, you know, just completely taken off guard. And then he just kept saying, "My gosh, it's true...". And from that point on, he began to look at me... he began to look at me like I was remarkable. Nothing happened at first. But then it did. A few times. Wait. You mean...? - Oh, I'm sorry. - No, it's alright. No, it's not alright, I shouldn't have. Does Dad know? Yes. How'd that go? Not well. But he's alright now, I think. I guess. I don't know, Autumn. What about Rose? She does not know. And she never will. - Probably best. - Yeah. Are you still in love with Dad? I don't think he's gay, I think he's just confused. I mean, I shared a bed with him at camp last year nothing happened. Well, you also shared a bed with Logan and nothing happened but that doesn't change anything. Dude, Logan's not gay. Um... - Cooper. - What? What? I'm not saying it's a bad thing, I'm just saying it's obvious. It's not a good thing, that's for sure. Well what do you think? Well, I mean, I think Christ teaches us to love everyone, whether they're addicts or criminals or gay people. Hate the sin, love the sinner. Well, yeah. That surprises me. Why? I don't know. I guess I just... I feel like you of all people would get it. You mean because of who I married? - Yeah. - That's not the same at all. People don't choose their race in the way that they choose to be gay. Hey. Hey, Dad. Where've you guys been? Oh, we've just been talking. Have you seen Ricky? No. You could come spend time with your brother, you know! I know! Be right back! She'll be right back. - How you doin'? - Good. - You? - Okay, okay. MMmmm. Anyway, if you um... yeah, I don't know... if you wanna come back over, or whatever, I promise not to run off screaming. Could you save me? I could totally save you. If we were down, I'd be like, I got her, I got her... I'd be like, I need resuscitation. - Thank you. - You’re very welcome. You're a very good lifeguard. - I gotcha. Always. - No matter what. Hey, Keith, could I talk to you for a sec? Okay, I'll try to survive without you. Okay, thanks a lot, try... Forgive me, Lord, forgive me, Lord, forgive me, Lord, forgive me, Lord... Stop. It seems like there’s lot of struggling going on, you know, bad influences, sexual confusion. Well, bud, the best we can do is to be examples of Christ. And that's it. I don't know, it just feels more urgent than that. It feels like... It feels like we're losing a whole generation. Oh, alright, that's what I'm talking about! What've you been doing, hon? Watching TV. Well I don't know why. It's a nice night. Will you LAY OFF HER! Do whatever you want, Grace! Um, thanks, Dad. What is that? Well I want some! Well, I'll go get you some, Ms. Rose. You all aren't drinking alcohol, are ya? Where'd Aaron go? I don't know. Do you know that I love you? Sure do. Oh, thank you, dear. Do you want some? No, thank you. Kathleen, I'm not so sure about some of these friends of Henry's. Which ones? Those girls there. Oh, Heather and Christine? They're very good friends of Henry's. They're great girls. And that Logan, he sure is a sad one, isn't he? You know what, I think it's time to change the channel, Bob? Take it to the next level? Uh, not exactly sure what that means, but- Actually I will do it. Hen! What?! Our Mix? Do it! Anyone wanna swim? I'll go. Grace... Come on, Gracie, let's go! No. Autumn? What? Swim? Happy birthday, baby. Thanks. Hey. Hey. Heather. Christine. Get on the shark. Bring that shark over here. Welcome back to the pool. It's good to be back. So... hey everyone, hello... Uh, before we all part for the night, I've asked Bob if it'd be alright for me to sort of bless this and bring this home and bless this wonderful young man who's birthday we're celebrating today. Amen. Love you, buddy. Mom. Lord, I just wanna thank you for the wonderful young man that Henry's turning into. Thank you for the gift of his life, and for allowing us to enjoy this time with him. As he goes into his late teenage years, we ask that you will stay by his side every step of the way. - Doesn't he do that already? - Who knows? And Lord, we ask that you bless his parents, who are doing so well to raise him. And continue to fill this house with strength, wisdom and love, and guide our friend Henry into a future filled with love and happiness and Your Word. Thank you for this evening and for all those who've made it possible. One, two, three, four... ♪ Lord, we thank you. ♪ ♪ Lord, we love you. ♪ ♪ We can hear you now. ♪ ♪ Singing in our hearts... ♪ ♪ Lord... ♪ MOM. - Oh my stars, son! - I'm sorry, Mama. Please can we go home? I just wanna go home. - Oh! - Let's go. Come on. We're doing it all wrong, people! You, you're gay, that's fine. Lord made you that way, fine, fuck it. Let's just get you home. I'll be over later. Where are you gonna take him, St. Francis? Yeah, that's the closest, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. Oh, I just don't know why he'd do something like this. Keep in touch. Night, Henry. Happy Birthday. Happy birthday, Henry. - Got my bag? - Yeah, right here, Mom. Hey, Logan, I'm gonna text your Mom, okay? - Okay. - Oh, wait. Do you wanna sleep over? Oh. Hey. Thanks for coming. - Happy birthday. - Thanks. - Bye. - Bye. Hey, yeah, I'll see you at church. - Yeah, see you at church. - Okay. Hey. Thanks for coming. Enjoy Spy Kids. All of them.

Night, babe. Happy birthday. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Okay. - Bye. - Bye. Hi. - Hey. - Hey. Alright, we're going to bed. Don't stay up too late, church in the morning. Yeah, Logan, your Mom's gonna be here at 8.00, okay? Okay. Night, bud. Night. Hope that was an okay party. It was. Thanks. - Night, I love you. - Love you. - Love you. - Love you. You wanna go upstairs? Um. Um, yeah, I can't stay for long, but sure. Night, kid. Night. Thanks for coming home. No problem. - Night, Logan. - Night. You know I've forgiven you. I know. - You know that. - I know. This isn't about that. I mean, it is, but it isn't. Bob. What? I think I'm gonna need some time away... Kathleen, please don't do this... I'm sorry. Please... I think, I'm gonna see if Amy can take me for a while. - Listen... - I'll go to church, we don't have to tell the church. But I'm gonna see if Amy will let me stay with her for a while. And you... you, Bob. You need to spend some time with your boy. - But he needs you. - No, he needs you more. He needs your blessing. Hey, I listen to music when I go to sleep, is that alright? Yeah, that's cool. Okay uh... What do you wanna listen to? Doesn't matter. You've got good taste, you pick. Okay. Hey, um... I want to apologize to you for, um... not talking to you a lot in school. Or for, um... not sticking up for you. I'm sorry. That's okay. Do you wanna kiss? What do you mean? I mean... that. Maybe it's okay. Okay. Okay.
