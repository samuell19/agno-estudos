Did you see it? I think I got it. That little piggy was fast. Hey, everybody, this is all of our kill. We all take credit. - I got a side ache. - You hit Enmebaragesi. I'm pretty sure he had that when he left the village. That's not my spear. My spear has feathers... Okay, that one's got a feather. Okay, that is my spear. I'm sorry, man. Great. Two spears. Twice the killing power. Thanks a lot. Next time don't block my shot. What? I didn't say... Come on, not my fault. Who stands in front of a boar on a hunt? Hey, there you are. I don't think you wanna be gathered. You wanna be eaten. Hi, Marlak. Well, there won't be any berries in the fruit salad now, so we all lose. Hey, Oh. How's it going? Hunters think they're so cool. You know, they... They don't think this is challenging? Gathering? It's extremely challenging. You have to find all the fruit with the least amount of bird shit on it... ...and put it in the basket. Are they picking on you? If they're picking on you, I will straighten them out. - All right. Yeah, would you? - You're right. Let it slide this time. Next time, though, they will feel the tip of my short spear. - What happened to your spear? - I modified it. Made it a snub nose. It's lighter. It's a better killing tool. Anyway... Oh, there's Maya. I'm gonna go talk to her. I'll be right back. Unless something goes horribly right. - Hello, Maya. - Hey, Zed. What do I gotta do to make you my woman? Look, you're a special guy. You've got a lot of personality. When my parents were killed by that pack of wild dogs... ...you really helped me see the funny side. "No, no! He's got my ankle!" "Get off." That's your mom. So, yeah, you make me laugh, but that's not enough. I'm an old-fashioned kind of girl. I need a man who can protect me and take care of me. What do you mean? Like Marlak? Well, I mean, he is the best hunter in the village. - Debatable. - People voted. Maybe I'm not the greatest hunter. - Or gatherer. - Yes. Or gatherer. Zed, those are the only two jobs that we have here. I can take care of you. Does it look like I'm starving? Come on. Tell me you can say no to this. Give it a second. Let it work on you. Oh, yeah. Absolutely can say no to that. Maya. Can I see you later? I think I have to wash my hair. You washed your hair last year. Tonight, we feast. Maya. For you. Thanks, Marlak. Another severed boar's head. - It's a different color. - Yeah, this one is... - Left the tongue in. - Yeah, this is really nice, Marlak. Look at Marlak flirting with Maya. He doesn't know her at all. Head's not even the best part of the boar. It's the back fat, stupid. Muscleheaded idiot. Hi, Eema. Hi, Eema. Hi, Eema. Yeah. She doesn't even know I exist. There's like 60 people in the village. I mean... ...you have to go out of your way to not know that somebody exists. I just wanna lay with her so badly. I don't see it. She's cute, but I don't think I'd lay with her. She's your sister. I mean, that'd be like laying with your mother. Which was a big mistake. I see that now. You think it's not gonna be awkward in the morning, but... Trust me, wow. Listen, you wanna impress Eema? Do the fertility dance with her... Listen, you wanna impress Eema? Do the fertility dance with her... ...at the feast tonight then drag her back to your hut. My hut's a mess right now, and what if she struggles? You give her a little tap on the head. Women respond to that. I still live with my parents. I don't wanna keep them up all night with my raucous lovemaking. I'd get an earful in the morning. She only likes hunters. She doesn't like gatherers. She's a gatherer herself is the irony. She's a self-loathing gatherer. - That's pretty suggestive. - I wouldn't read too much into that. Okay, now she's just asking for some splinters. Hey, hey... Squanto. Give me a break, would you? You got the whole forest. Why does everybody always have to take a crap right behind my hut? I could be wrong, I think what it is is that all the poop in the area... ...fertilizes the ground and it gives the leaves a softer feel for wiping. It's not that nobody respects you. I haven't heard that from everyone. I've had it. Let's go. Where are we going? We're not supposed to go this far. I'm sick of the whole village treating me like a joke. - You know what I'm gonna do? - Change villages. No. I'm gonna change my head. I don't think that's possible. Your head is attached to your body. Not the whole head. I mean, my mind. Mind... Don't tell me you're thinking about eating forbidden fruit. That's exactly what I'm thinking. Zed, that's the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. You don't eat from that one. It's forbidden. But why is it forbidden? What is it they don't want us to have? It's not the fruit. It's about the rule. It's about doing what you're told. We've been doing what we were told our entire lives. - How's that worked out? - I like doing what I'm told. It gives my day some much-needed structure. Wait. Zed. Stop. It's just a piece of fruit. Eating a fruit is not gonna change your life. What if it's magic fruit? What if this makes me the smartest man the village has ever known? That's a pretty low bar. Then all the hunters would have to bow down to me. Maya would lay with me like that. That's what this is about? Laying with Maya? I have a great destiny, I'm about to find out what it is. Put the fruit down. What if somebody sees us? They'll peel our skin off and tie us to an anthill. Now you've done it. It's got sort of a knowledge-y taste. Does it have a sort of forbidden taste? That's what it is. - Oh, I definitely feel something. - What? Less hungry, for one, but also more intelligenter. It's like I feel like maybe I know everything. Ask me something. Anything. Go. Test me. Go. All right, where does the sun go at night? Pass. Next question. - Okay, where do babies come from? - Pass. Next question. - There's a snake on my foot. - In the form of a question.
