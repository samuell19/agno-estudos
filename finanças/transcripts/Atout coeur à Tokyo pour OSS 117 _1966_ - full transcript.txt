Go on! Faster! They went that way. OSS 117: TERROR IN TOKYO Smith, what's going on? I pick up Clark, I don't know why. He's killed, I don't know who by. - I'm not curious... - But you want to be briefed. - Indeed. - It's your right. Eight months ago, the State Department was contacted by a mysterious organisation wishing to sell a new weapon, something that couldn't be traced or destroyed. The usual blackmail, all bluff. Not quite. You'll see. After some difficulties, we had Clark hired in one of the organisation's secret laboratories. Where I picked him up. He couldn't tell us what he knew. What price was this invention? 100 million dollars. That's exactly what HQ thought. If we refused, they threatened to blow up one of our bases. When? Last night at eight o'clock. These pictures were recorded by the cameras at Base 124, which was destroyed. Yet all our bases received the alert instructions. - This one too. - Of course. Thanks to that, there were no victims. There. Five seconds before the explosion. Three seconds. One second. This is all we picked up. What's that? The radars showed a silhouette identical to one of our F107 fighters. The flight plans have been checked, but no F107 aircraft were over the region on that day. - Maybe it was a fake F107. - What? Impossible. One second before the explosion, the plane is small in the photo. So it was a long way from the base. None of its missiles could have reached the base in less than a second. Exactly. Excuse me, but let's suppose it is an F107, a tiny little F107. It would be near the base and small on the photo. That's a tiny little secret agent's idea! A tiny little secret agent's idea is better than none at all. Rollston, our agent in Tokyo, has just sent us a report in which he too mentions the hypothesis of miniature planes. - My dear Hubert... - I get it. You're sending me to Japan. Yes. Here are your orders. A military flight is leaving right away. Babcock, our CIA resident in Tokyo, is waiting for you and will have you contact Rollston. Clear? Very. - Ralph Babcock, Tokyo CIA. - Charmed. - Here are my orders. - Saki. - Very honoured. - He knows the country well. - When can I see Rollston? - It won't be possible. We've had no news from him since yesterday morning. That's a good start. He said that if anything stopped him getting in contact, we must protect a woman from the code section at the embassy, Eva Wilson. Protect her? He said it was of the greatest importance. - I must see her quickly. - She's waiting in my office. Go ahead, Mrs Wilson. We're listening. Please... I'd rather Rollston explained himself. For lots of reasons, I'd rather you explained. It's not pleasant to say... Especially in front of men. Eva, please, it's very important. There's not a minute to lose. Well, one evening, a few months ago, I met an officer in Tokyo. He was friendly and amusing. We went to a cabaret, the Mikado. We danced and... And then? I don't know what happened. I don't remember. I remember waking up in a bedroom in a Tokyo suburb. A room I'd never seen. It was morning and I was alone. It's pretty incredible. Carry on. I never saw the officer again. But a week later, I was visited by a Japanese man. I'd seen him at the cabaret. He came to show me photos. - Photos of me. - Yes. If I've got this right, the photos taken with this officer in the hotel were... How can I put it? Compromising. Yes. - Do you have the photos? - No. It was blackmail. He threatened to send them to my husband. - Your husband in Washington? - Yes. If I didn't supply certain information. Don't worry, your husband won't see those photos, because you gave them the information. - You knew? - Yes. - Since when? - Since you started your story. What kind of information was it? - The radio codes of a base. - Which base? - Base 124, obviously. - 124? The one that was destroyed. Yes. Mrs Wilson, this is a matter for the courts. We have to repatriate you forthwith. As a result, we'll... We'll... let you go free. Why? My dear Babcock, you understand. The Japanese man will try to contact poor Eva Wilson again for more information. It's our only chance to trace the network to the top. Yes. So don't be discouraged, Mrs Wilson. Be reassured. Tomorrow your husband will be here, never to leave you. - My husband? - He arrives tomorrow at 10am. What husband? Mr Wilson. We'll grant his wife extended leave for a pleasant vacation in Tokyo. In Tokyo? My husband? Yes. Arrival of KLM flight 228, from Washington. Exit gate B. Hello, Eva! Eva! You've got a nerve. Always. That's why I'm a colonel. - You should be a general. - You're not the first to say that. - Hello, Eva. - Hello. So glad to finally meet your husband. Come for a drink on Wednesday. We'll go, we don't want to intrude. See you soon. Goodbye. Hello. You know Eva's husband just got here? Is this really necessary? It's very pleasant. I'd like a little more conviction. - That's not your case, Colonel. - My name's John, don't forget. The only reason I'm here is so that everyone you know in Tokyo knows that your husband has arrived. - Right. - "Right, John." You take your role as husband very seriously. Very. Might I ask how far you intend to take this role? When it comes to defending my country, I have no limits. It's a very ancient custom. These papers answer all the questions we may have. What does mine say? "Time favours an honest man's projects." That's good. And this one? "You don't argue with the wind. So why argue with a woman?" - What's wrong? - He's the blackmailer. What does he want? To meet me tonight at the Seng Su temple. I expected this. You'll go. - Alone? - No, I'll follow. He'll spot you. Have no fear, I'll be far off. You'll carry a mic. Where will you hide it? Here. It's not a Cartier, but it's precious. Latest-generation Japanese technology. May I? Where shall I put the battery? Turn around, please. That's perfect. Are you cold? Pass me the wire. Thank you. You really think it'll be of any use? - Pessimist. - I'm a realist. He speaks Japanese, you won't understand. You'll skim through a phrasebook... Who says I'll be listening alone? There! Don't take this as a compliment, but you really are made to wear a battery. - Thank you. - Now let's test it. Go on, speak. I could tell you everything the man says without using a mic. You're wary of me. That's fine, then. Always beware of women with a beauty spot on their hip. Yes. Just there. - There, I'm ready. - Let's go. Are you scared? Yes. Do what I said and it'll be fine. If you're in danger, call me immediately. When you leave him, go straight home. Got that? Yes. If he's not there, I'll wait a few minutes, then go home. Those are my orders, aren't they? I'll tell you what I think of you now. How brave you are, Colonel, having me take all the risks to accomplish your mission. Good evening. Thank you. No, thank you. John Wilson. How do you feel? Fine. How about you? Me hit head on low ceiling. Mama-san says you broke the camera. Of course, how silly of me! There. How many? Five? Three, four and five. - Hello. - At last! I've waited hours. I was worried sick. - That's very nice. - What were you doing? Silly things. I banged my head. - Is it serious? - No. But it's tiresome. I lost track of your friend. How did you get on at the temple? He was suspicious and ripped out the microphone. He'll set up another meeting, but if I do it again, he'll... Eliminate you? - That's perfect. - I hope you're joking. No, I'm quite serious. Think about it. If they're interested in you, they'll show up. - Somehow or another. - And kill me? No, don't worry. There's no danger. Because I'm honoured to have your protection? You could say "happy". It'll be fine, you'll see. We've a whole night to think about it. Have you ever been called a cad? No. I kill people before they have time to say it. - Will you kill me? - Not yet. I'll give you a chance to redeem yourself. What must I do? Kiss me. I don't want to kiss you. - Very well. In that case... - Where are you going? Hilton Hotel, room 122. If you're shot at, call me. Hubert! Apologising? I'm scared. Then just trust me. Definitely not. Do you want a Band-Aid? You'd better hurry. He won't be around long. Stop! I didn't want to kill you. It's a terrible misunderstanding! - Explain! - Just a simple needle to make honourable foreigner sleep. Honourable! - What for? - To take you... - Where? - To chat with friends. Fine. Then take me quietly where I'm meant to go. - It's easy. - But very embarrassing for... - For whom? - For Mr Chang. This toy fires 9mm needles and makes holes you can't stitch up. Shall we go? You'll swear Mr Chang only gave in to violence? You're a reasonable man. This way. Hey... - Where am I going? - Right on the bridge. And now? You carry straight on. We're right behind you, Mr Wilson. Do exactly as you're told or your car will blow up. Glance behind you. You'll see a magnetic mine. Any suspicious moves, and it'll blow you up. Turn right now. - Can I say something? - Speak, Mr Chang. I'm sorry to evoke my personal case, but as the disappearance of my miserable person is not indispensable, I could get out of car. Impossible. If you got out, he'd do the same. Till now you've been satisfied with my services. That's true. But we have no choice. Did you hear? Above all, no funny business. And do everything they say. I've got it. And I'll follow your instructions. It's in your interest, Mr Wilson. That's good, very good. You're a wise man. "The tree clings to its fruit..." "As the wise man does his life." Confucius. Both wise and educated, that's very good. No, thank you. A few months ago, I met an officer in Tokyo. He was friendly and amusing. We went to a cabaret, the Mikado. We danced and... And then? I don't know what happened. I was visited by a Japanese man. I'd seen him at the cabaret. - What was he doing there? - He was with a girl. Pretty? Not especially. - You're sure it's her? - Yes. Excuse me, I need to take a closer look. Professional curiosity. I know your professional curiosity. - Jealous? - Wouldn't you be pleased! Good evening. - How much? - Three tickets to dance. - And if we have a drink? - Another three. I'll buy now before the price rises. Eva, this is Miss Three Tickets. - Tetsuko. - Miss... Tetsuko, my sister. She's in a bad mood because she lost a bet. As I'm shy, she bet I wouldn't dare invite you. There. Let's go. You're becoming bolder all the time. He doesn't look like a shy boy. You don't know him. He hides it well. Eva, it's one o'clock. Mother will worry. You said you'd be back by midnight. Our mother has asthma. It's sad. The doctors think that was what caused my brother's epilepsy. If it happens, act right away to bring the blood back to the head. Like this. Good evening. I wish you lots of patience and courage. - Good night, John. - Good night, sister dear... Don't wait up. I may be back late. I'm looking for a friend. - Does he come here often? - Yes, you must know him. - Maybe. - He's Japanese. Like 50 million other men. I know. But he often wears a mac. He's quite tall. It's still very vague. Wait. He has a scar under the right eye. That's somewhat less vague. - You really know him? - Yes. Do you know him too? - No, I don't know him. - Shame. I'm sorry. Is he so interesting? No, not at all. I'm interested in you. What about a drink elsewhere? What do you mean by "a drink elsewhere"? - Ending the evening together. - I'm very flattered. But I can't leave before the end of the party. That said, I can't dance with you any more. Why? You've no more tickets. Don't go. - There. - Thank you. I've got a friend to cover for me. We can go. - Right now? - If you like. Then let's go. Excuse me. Here, old chap. A gift from the UN. Where are we going? To a ryokan. Great. What's that? You don't know ryokan? It's a comfortable, isolated inn. - What's your name? - John Wilson. Are you married? Yes. But don't worry, my wife stayed in the US. I'm not worried. What are you doing in Tokyo? - I'm an agent... - For a large industrial company. You guessed. I sell diggers and earthmovers and... ..bulldozers. A sales argument? It eliminates the competition. You're well equipped. You too. - What's that? - A mic. Odd. What's that for? Almost all the Mikado dancers wear them. To find out if a client is proper. So everything I said... They heard, of course. Does that bother you? Not at all. - Where's the battery? - In the sleeve. - Do go in. - After you. - No. You must take your shoes off. - I'm sorry. The owner says you must wear a kimono. Very well. You must go with them. With pleasure. What did you say? Sorry, just passing through. Oh, you want me to stay with you. Watch out, this will burn! Come on, you'll catch cold. What are you doing in my car? Looking for you. You disappeared. There's something I don't get. Oh... Who might you be? Colonel Kawachi, Japanese secret service. Charmed. John Wilson. Yes, I know. It's the name on your passport. Your behaviour since arriving has been strange and I have another hypothesis. Which? I think you're a CIA agent, maybe even OSS 117. I'm too flattered to deny it. I told Tetsuko to organise an interview in the ryokan. The sumotori who wanted you to stay didn't have time to tell you. You are impatient. That's true. We're all pretty nervous at the moment. - One of our agents is missing. - Rollston? - You knew? - I know everything that goes on. I can help you if you bring me up to speed. So, what are you looking for? One of your compatriots with a scar under the right eye. - This young lady knows him. - We're looking for him too. That's why Tetsuko-san works at the Mikado. I see. It's becoming clearer now. Believe me, things would be much easier if our services collaborated more closely. Absolutely. I'd love to collaborate with a pretty taxi-girl. She's not a taxi-girl. She's a sergeant. Sergeant, I like you a lot. I like you too, Colonel. We're going to work well together. That's my impression too, Colonel. - I should have been suspicious. - Of what? Japanese women. I had been warned, though. You're fearsome. Are you afraid? This is a baptism of sorts. Your first Japanese kiss? No. My first sergeant. Colonel Kawachi. - Can I see the film? - Yes, you shall. Let's go, then. Stop! Interesting, no? Very interesting. Did you check the plates? The number's fake. Next day, two men were waiting as she left the Mikado. She took the same car. Stop. Print several shots of that. Interesting, it's true. What will you do? Talk to her. Eva? It's me, John. No, everything's fine. Tetsuko? In the end, I wasn't her type. Look, I have to go to Hong Kong for two days. Yes, immediately. Could you bring my bag to the airport? Well? Someone arrived at her place 15 minutes ago. Show me. Here. Hello, Babcock? Yes, it's me. Telephone Mrs Wilson. Have her come on some pretext. And try to keep her there for 10 minutes. Thanks. - Who are you? - And you? I'm asking the questions here. Why? Because I have a gun. And because my wife lives here. Your wife? - You are John Wilson? - Exactly. - That's odd. - Why? You don't look like him. - You know him? - Slightly. I'm in no mood for jokes. I'm sorry, but I came to see my wife. Your wife? Yes, Eva. I'm Eva's husband. Do you have some ID? Sorry, Mr Wilson. I didn't expect you. Sorry for asking questions, but you're pretending to be me. Why? Eva is in danger, I'm looking out for her. I see why she was so mysterious and nervous. - Cigarette? - No, I don't smoke. Thank you. So you live here. With her. Yes. Don't think I feel bitter. Eva and I have been separated for two years. We intend to divorce. We just don't get on. I'm in Tokyo on business. I thought I'd drop in. I understand. You say she's in danger. Is she risking her life? That's not impossible. I advised her not to take that job in the cipher office. It's too risky. She didn't listen. Don't worry, I've no intention of embarrassing you. Tell Eva I've understood the situation. I shall. I'll be going. Look after her, Mr Wilson. I am, Mr Wilson. Still here? I told you to go. Please leave. Am I in the way? - You? - Happy to see me? Of course. I like to hear you say it. I had to come back. I've something to ask you. - Something important? - Yes. This Japanese man who set up the meeting, did he snatch the mic off you? Yes. How did he do it? Show me. How exactly? Like this. It didn't tear your dress? No. The clip can't have been closed properly. Sorry, but it was. I did it myself. What happened to the wire and the battery? I don't know, I was so scared. I don't remember. Yes, you must have been terrified. You didn't walk home, did you? No. I took a taxi straight away. There's something I don't understand. Look. Here you're taking the clip off. And it's an odd taxi you took. And at the Mikado, you didn't tell me two men were waiting for you. That reminds me. I met one of your friends. - Where? - Here. Here? You know what his name is? John Wilson. Amusing, isn't it? Hello? Yes, it's me. Saki's been killed. - Where? - At the Yochi temple. I'll be right there. Mrs Wilson, let me jog your memory. The blackmail, the compromising photos. You made it all up, didn't you? No one forced you to give out radio frequencies. No. Then why? For whom? Give me the reason. - You saw the reason for yourself. - Your husband? So he's part of the organisation. - Are you too? - No, I swear! Come with me. My husband's a great technician, but too ambitious. I left him after five years. Why? - Because of the people he saw. - Which people? Foreign financiers. He was working on an invention that'd make our fortune. I hadn't seen him in two years and he showed up in Tokyo. - Demanding information? - Yes. He said if I refused the organisation would execute him. Do you love him? No, but I lived with him for five years. - What else do you know? - Absolutely nothing. I don't even know where he lives in Tokyo. - That's horrible. - Poor Saki... Hubert, I just spoke to Smith. The organisation's deadline expires tomorrow morning. - Washington has agreed to negotiate. - What? To negotiate? Indeed. The ransom will be paid tomorrow at dawn. The organisation will tell us what to do. - It's a fool's deal. - Why? The organisation could sell the plans to anyone after us. If we negotiate, it'll keep its base and the blackmail will begin again. Possible. But our HQ can't let another base be blown up. We have strict orders: to do nothing. We're supposed to lay low and attempt nothing. Anyway, I don't see what you could do. Indeed. I think I'll take a holiday. Mrs Wilson is of no further use. Best send her to Washington as soon as possible. She'll be tried as planned. So it's true? You're giving up? You've a bad opinion of me. I never give up. Then why send her to Washington? To play my final card. I'm sorry but I can't do anything for you. The organisation won't let me leave Japan. - Why did Hubert... - Look out! They're not the ones to follow. Wait a while. Fetch a doctor. Eva! Stop! Now it's our turn, Sergeant. Let's go! I know, I'm sorry. I work at the embassy. We'll do a test, Sergeant. I'll dial a number. I had no choice, Eva. If you'd gone to Washington, they'd have made you talk. You'd have spent years in prison. Ten years, maybe 20. You'd be poor and old when you got out. - And now? - Now we can sort it out. You're safe, you're out of danger. Tomorrow it'll all be over. You'll be able to live as you like. You'll be free. And seven. Well? The number isn't in the book. They'll give it to me. Strange. It's the number of Yokota-san's house. - Yokota? Who's that? - A Korean industrialist. - What does he make? - He's in electronics. Electronics... You can meet my partners. Mr Yokota, Mr Vargas, my wife. Very pleased to meet you, Mrs Wilson. Allow me to congratulate you. Congratulate me? Firstly on your great beauty. And for the help you've given our organisation. I'm very grateful. That's why I insisted on your not being harmed. It's much safer if you're with us. Much safer for everyone. Meanwhile, this house is your house. Yonake remains at your disposal. If you need the slightest thing, he is, as I am myself, at your service. Gentlemen... See you later, Mrs Wilson. - I didn't think I'd see you again. - Disappointed? Surprised. You underestimated me. Indeed. The old Korean with all the manners, is he Yokota? Yes. - And the other? - Vargas, a shipbuilder. Did you learn anything? The trade is tomorrow on the blue mountain pass, south of Nagasaki. They bring the plans, the Americans bring money. - Where's their base? - I don't know. I just know we're leaving tonight aboard a fast boat. Perfect. I'll give you something. It's a quartz transmitter. When you're in their base, plug it into any power point. It'll send a constant fixed-frequency signal. - I'll try. - Do it. It's the only way I'll know where you are. - And then? - I'll sort it out. - You asked for tea? - Yes, why? It's coming. Good luck. - Well? - Everything's ready, Colonel. We're on the quartz wavelength. Good. Keep listening. All we can do now is wait. There. Contact received, Colonel. 42 degrees north. 126 east. - It's out at sea. - On a boat? - Probably. - Let's go right away. And keep in contact. En route, pretty soldier. - We're relying on you. - I know. Count on me, Colonel. - Be careful. - I'll try. Eva, ready? They're waiting for us. Yes, I'll be right there. What's the matter? - Yokota scares me. - Why? Because he likes you. It's true, you are beautiful. You've never been so beautiful. I should never have let you go. Do you think we could live together again? Soon we'll be richer than you ever dreamed. Come on, they're waiting. Roger. Get out of the clouds so we can have a look. Ease off the gas and maintain this course. Battery number two. Received. Battery number three. Received. I'll let you know when Vargas gets there. Roger. Please go aboard. I'll stay on your wavelength. If it doesn't go as planned... Go and watch them. ..be ready to react. Rely on me. At my signal, launch a missile on Base 139. - Are we in contact with Vargas? - Not yet, Yokota-san. Vargas here. I'm at the spot. The truck's getting into position. Hello. Wilson here. - Can you hear me? - I can. We're at 22 degrees by 452. We're 60 nautical miles from US Base 139. Roger, thank you. If the Americans are on time, they should be at the rendezvous... ..in 30 seconds. There they are. Attention. Attention. Do not leave the aircraft before showing us that you are in possession of the planned ransom, 100 million dollars in raw diamonds. Your assessor can check the material. You will find the guidance formulae in the truck, the composition of metals for cladding the nuclear charge, and the formulae for the explosives. - They set a trap for us. - Do as planned, immediately. Right. Take off, quick! Wilson, the Americans have reneged on the deal. - Blow up their base. - Roger. Execution. Firing at plus 20. Device launched. We're starting the countdown. Radiation, maximum charge. Let's go now! Fetch the coordinates of their ship. The map's on the table. 35 degrees north. 126 east. I've got it. Phone call for Mr Hubert Bonisseur de La Bath.
