[dark music] [thunder rumbling] - It's really coming down hard. What's it like over there? - I'm on my way to rehearsal. Traffic's a nightmare. [kettle whistling] [sighs] - I hate this weather. - Tell me about it. It's bloody horrible. Makes the whole city feel crazy. Well, at least you've got a man in the house. Speaking of which, how's Robert doing? - Yeah, he's good. He's actually out of town this week. He got a new client, so he'll be in Japan. - That's a long flight. - Yeah, I know. - He travels so much. - This place just feels so big when he's gone. Shit! - What? - The power just went out. Let me call you back. - I'll be here. - Okay, bye. [bottles clinking] Hello? [intense music] [dramatic music] [thunder rumbling] Hello? [music continues] [clattering] [dramatic music] [instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] [thunder rumbling] [cello music] [music continues] - You're still having a hard time with that? - Vincent, hi. - I always thought your little hands were too fat for Dvorak. - Sorry, I thought I was alone. - No, I'm working late too. - Well, I hope I didn't disturb you. - No, I love listening to you play. - I'm still trying to master this legato. Dupree made it look so easy. - Well, I think she had more focus but honestly, I think you're more talented. [instrumental music] I love this theater late at night. It's so empty.. ...and so still. In the quiet I feel like I can find my muse. So when you're playing.. ...really pay attention to your breathing and really listen to your body and, Elizabeth, just play. - I'm trying. - Mm, maybe you should fucking try harder. [instrumental music] [music continues] - Elizabeth! You startled me. I was so focused on the front door, I didn't even see you there. - No, my apologies, that was my fault. Sorry. You going somewhere? - As a matter of fact I am. I am off on a weekend outing to the coast.. ...with a 36-year-old doctor, I might add. - Ooh! Sounds serious. - Or scandalous, depending on how you look at it. - I hope it's scandalous. - Honestly, me too. The London Philharmonic? Oh, my God! You made it in, didn't you? - Yeah, yeah. I was gonna tell you, but I just found out myself but yeah, they've accepted my application to their expansion program. - Ah, a summer in London studying with the finest. I'm jealous. - No, don't be. I hear it rains even more over there. - I'm so happy for you. - Thank you. - Hey, how about we celebrate when I get back? Monday? A true ladies' night in. I'll cook dinner at my place. What do you say, neighbor? - That sounds great. - Great, it's settled then. The castle is yours until my return. - Thank you, madam. - Hey, at least tell me you're celebrating this weekend? - Oh, I am. I'm treating myself to a nice relaxing weekend at home. - Perfect. No Justin? - Uh, no. Unfortunately. - Domestic problems? - Ah, just boyfriend drama. [intense music] - Oh, don't worry about him, he's harmless. - They always are in the beginning, and then it changes. Anyway, have a great weekend. - You too. [music continues] [instrumental music] [answering machine beeps] - Elizabeth, it's me. I bet you're staying home this weekend, being a vegetable. Hopefully with a nice bottle of wine. But look, that's not why I called. Oswald needs a place to crash this weekend. I know it's a lot to ask, but you're my only hope and you don't even have to call me back 'cause I'm already on my way over. I swear I will make this up to you. I'll see you in a bit. - I guess that settles that then. [answering machine beeps] - Honey, it's mom. Ah, the London Philharmonic my clever girl. Dad and I are so proud of you. It gives us an excuse to come over and visit the family this summer. Hmm, how exciting. Anyway, love, don't forget to call me this weekend. Better yet, let's talk on the computer. I finally figured out that video chat thing. I love you. Bye. [answering machine beeps] - It's Justin. I really need to talk to you. It's important. Look, I know I said some things that didn't sit well with you and I'm sorry, but avoiding me is not gonna make this any better. I'll be back in town tomorrow and really want to see you. It's killing me that you're not picking up. It's 2:30 right now. If I get in early, I'll text you.. ...or just stop by. I'm serious about.. - So am I. - And in other news, the body of Emily Bishop was found late last evening in her home in Sylvan Highlands. The police investigation is currently under way. The death is the fourth in 6 months to rock the city of Portland and its surrounding areas. Police Chief Horace McFadden says that since.. [thunder rumbling] [instrumental music] [door shuts] - Jesus! [intense music] [dramatic music] [kettle whistling] [instrumental music] [knock on door] Hang on! - Elizabeth, you live in Portland, Oregon for God sakes, not Detroit. - Oh, please! How many locks do you have on your door again? - 9. But I live in a different neighborhood. - Oswald, my man. Welcome back. - Thanks for taking care of Oz for me. - Sure. - I'll be back Sunday evening to get him. Monday, for sure. God sakes, I don't want to keep interrupting your personal time. - It's fine. Come on, let's go sit down. So, Marty, I've been waiting for you to tell me what's really been bothering you. You never bring Oz over unannounced. - I'll tell you, I just needed to work up the courage. - Sounds serious. Whenever you're ready. - I have to leave the symphony. - In the middle of the season? Why? What's happened? - My son happened. - Daniel? What's wrong with him? - Nothing is wrong with him. Between shows and rehearsals and travels and more rehearsals, I'm never home. I missed his first steps, E. I'm never gonna get that back. - Honey, Marty we can fix this, I promise. We've been through worse together. [intense music] [music continues] [thunder rumbling] [cello music] [Oswald mewing] Oz, you hungry? Dinner is up. It's Fancy Feast for you, young man. [intense music] [dramatic music] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] Justin? Justin! Hello? - Hey, sis, what's going on? - I just thought I'd call and say hi. Can you believe this storm? It's crazy. Where are you? - Just passing over Bridal Falls. - You gonna be at mom and dad's on Monday? - Uh. it looks like it. Everything alright? - Um, sort of. - I don't think I like the sound of that. - No, really, no, everything's fine. Everything's alright. What's, what's your drive like? - It's pouring rain, visibility zero. Weatherman's promising a huge storm. Standard Oregon fair. - Well, then, I should let you go. You've got to concentrate on the road. - No, I can, I can talk for a bit. - Oswald's here. - Marty's cat? Is Marty okay? - Yeah. Yeah, she's fine. - Good God, how long has she had that cat? Seems like forever. [instrumental music] Uh, hello? What are you doing? - I'm staring at a piece of lint behind the water heater. - What? - I don't know what I'm doing. - You're doing a security check, aren't you? I should have known, you're such a little girl. - Maybe I am. - What for? Something got you spooked? - Ah, yeah, no. No, it's fine, it's nothing. Do you remember all those stories that dad used to tell us when we were young? - Uh, dad told us a lot of stories, E. - Yeah, but I'm talking about the scary ones. - Uh, I know, I remember. - Do you think he enjoyed watching our imaginations squirm? - Absolutely. [intense music] - I just found Rusty. - Your old teddy bear. - Yeah, he was hiding under the bed. [alarm blaring] Oh, Jesus Christ! - What? Elizabeth? - My alarm.. My alarm went off and scared the hell out of me. - Listen, it sounds like you have everything under control over there, I'm gonna, gonna go. It's, uh, treacherous driving out here. - Okay, maybe you're right. I think I'll have another glass of wine. - I'll see you at mom and dad's. Uh, talk soon. - Okay, drive safe, bye. - Bye. [thunder rumbling] [intense music] [music continues] - Here we go. [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [dramatic music] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [toilet flushes] [intense music] [music continues] [dramatic music] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [birds chirping] [instrumental music] - Ozzie, behave. I'll be back in a jiffy. [music continues] [intense music] [music continues] [cello music on headphones] - Hey, is, is your name Elizabeth? - Yeah. Do I know you? - Uh, no, sorry. Um, you don't know me, we -- we haven't met but I, I live in the neighborhood or I guess, you live in mine. - Cool. Berkeley. - Yeah. Yeah, I -- I live in the big blue house um, with the white trim on it. - Oh, I know that house! Yeah, that's a great spot. I walk past it every day. - Yeah, it's a great neighborhood. I love it. I live off of JoLa's coffee. - Ah, it's the best coffee in the city. - Right? - I love their pastries. They're super buttery, but my God, they're delicious. - I think it was last week, I saw you there. I was, I was just waiting for my order. I -- I couldn't help overhear you talking. - You know what, you're right. Justin and I were there celebrating some good news. What better place to do it, than JoLa's, right? - Yeah, it's perfect. Justin's your boyfriend? - Uh, yeah, if you mean the guy with the beard, that's him. - Oh, my name's John, by the way. - Elizabeth. It's a pleasure to meet you. - Likewise. - So, how long have you lived on Berkeley? - Uh, about 3 years now. - I got you beat. I've been there 4. It's such a beautiful neighborhood. - Yeah, I like it. - Isn't it crazy though that we've lived on the same street for 3, 4 years, and here we are just meeting by chance? - I blame the internet, you know that whole online dating thing? - Hm, my friend Marty's into meeting people online. Me, I could never do it. It kills the romance for me. - Yeah, well, for some of us shy types it's kinda one of the only ways to really get ourselves out there, you know? - I hear you. So, any luck? - Ah, no.. [chuckles] No luck. But they say, the fun is in the trying, so.. - Hm, I don't know it just always seemed like such an awkward way to meet people. Then, I'm the kind of person I don't even like to send e-mails. I actually still have one of those old answering machines from the 1980s that my parents used to own. - Really? - Mm-hmm. -Does it still work? - Oh, yeah. - I remember those. - Justin calls me analog. He thinks I'm that old-fashioned. - I think that's cool. I mean, you know, everyone these days is so obsessed with their phone and texting. There's no eye contact any more, you know? - I know. Not me though. I like to see the world around me. - Well, hey, it was nice to meet you. - Likewise, John. It's always nice to meet a neighbor. - Maybe I'll see you around. - Yeah, that'd be great. Have a good one. [instrumental music] [dramatic music] [music continues] [door opens] [door closes] - Elizabeth? E? Elizabeth. You home? [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] Holy shit! - I'm almost happy to see you. [instrumental music] [Elizabeth chuckles] Stop. [dramatic music] [music continues] [Elizabeth moans] [music continues] [Elizabeth moans] Oh, God. [music continues] - So was that make-up sex or break-up sex? - I don't know yet, haven't decided. - Fair enough. You'll never guess who I ran into? - Hm. - Professor Renwood. Apparently he's heading up the new agricultural division responsible for documenting my research. - Wait, not the same Professor Renwood who denied you a referral? - The same. Now I'm his boss. - You're kidding. - How ironic is that? - Perfect example of poetic justice. - This is delicious. Thank you. - You're welcome. - None for you? - I'm not hungry. So, have you given any more thought of coming to London with me? - I can't go. Not right now. - Why? - It's not up to me. - But it is up to you, it's your project. - And that's why I can't leave just now. I know this trip is important to you, to your career and I think that's why it's been so crazy for both of us but if I leave now, I could be jeopardizing the future of my research and of my project. And if you don't go to London.. ...you'll regret it the rest of your life. - No, it's worse than that. I could lose my seat with the orchestra. - And I could lose my tenure at the university. I'm sorry. I know how you had your heart set on us being together in London. - Well, I should have expected this, right? This is what happens when two ambitious people fall in love. - Look, E.. ...I've been thinking and maybe we should think about moving in together when you get back? - Shacking up? Really? - You'll have a contract position at the Philharmonic. I'll have tenure at the university. We'll have enough money, and we can be workaholics together. - Alright. I guess I'm officially accepting your bad news. - I love you. - Hm. Whatever. [Oswald mews] - Hey, Oswald, good buddy. I heard you were in town. - Hm. Did you go by your house, or did you come straight here? - Nah, I came straight here. - You gonna go home? - Yeah, I gotta make sure Charlie didn't tear up the place. You remember Charlie, don't you, Oswald? - Hmm. Be careful, you know, what they say, dogs get jealous. - Yeah, right. - I'm gonna go take a shower. You're gonna let yourself out? - Yes, I can. Speaking of letting yourself out, young lady.. ...maybe it's time you find another hiding spot for your spare key? - Like where? - Like nowhere. Under the flower pot went out in the '90s. - Why don't you keep it? [intense music] So, are you coming back tonight? - I don't know. You want me to? - Hmm, honestly, honey, it's okay. I think I've already moved on. [music continues] - So we're officially calling that make-up sex then? - I guess so. Lock the door on your way out. - Right. - Oh, Justin! - Yeah? - Don't forget about dinner with the parents on Monday night. - Uh, this is the first I've heard of it. - Well, can you make it? - Your mother would never forgive me if I didn't. Of course, I'll be there. - Okay. See you tonight. [music continues] [chuckles] - Hey, E, I forgot I picked you some wildflowers. [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [instrumental music] - The usual? - Yeah. - Turkey, cranberry sandwich and an Americano. Do you want an extra shot with that? It's only a buck. - Sure. - Cool. I'll have that up in about 15 minutes for you if you want to go take a seat. - Thanks. - Yeah. [music continues] - Hey, Dakota. - Hey. - What's going on? - Hanging out. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Where's your mom? - Over there. - Oh, yeah? High five. I'll see you later, alright? - Yeah. Bye. - Bye. [intense music] - Your food is ready. - That was quick. - Yeah, I threw in a chocolate chip cookie. I know that's why you like to come back. - Thanks. - Yeah. See you tomorrow. [instrumental music] - So you wanted to see me? - Yes, I wanna ask you for some advice. - Let me guess, you're having second thoughts about going to England. - Perhaps. - You are such a disappointment to me. You have so much talent. You actually have so much talent that I envy you. And now you're asking me to stand here and bear witness to you throwing your life away over some stupid person, over some stupid situation? - I just wonder if there are other priorities to take into consideration. - No! This is your only opportunity! Don't squander your fucking potential! [intense music] [cello music] [cello music] [intense music] [music continues] [thunder rumbling] [intense music] [music continues] [knock on door] - John? - Surprise. - What are you doing here? - Uh, did you loose this? - My wallet. Hold on a second. Hey. - Hey. - Thanks. Come on in. - Oh, great. - Come in, come in. - Oh. Hey, you must have dropped it when you were at the Laundromat. I found it when I was going to dry my clothes. It's all there, I promise. - Wow, I can't believe I.. - Yeah, it was on top of the washer. Your address was in your ID, it's on your license, so.. - Oh, right. Uh, uh, thank you. This is great. I, uh.. Uh, thank God it was you who found it, right? - Yeah. - You're soaking wet, let me get you a towel. - Oh, that'd be great, thanks. I figured since were neighbors I might as well just bring it by. - Of course, thank you. - Do you mind if I take my coat off? [indistinct] Stay a while, it's the least I can do. - Oh, thanks. - Really. - I lost my wallet once too. It was such a pain in the ass getting everything replaced and canceled. - Yeah, I need to be more careful. It must have just fallen out of my pocket or something. - Yeah. It's a cool pad. - Thank you. It's cozy. [intense music] - You're a musician? - Yeah, I'm actually with the Portland Philharmonic. - Really? That's interesting. - How so? - I don't know, I guess I just have never met a classical musician before. - Hmm. - People normally have like boring jobs. Like Starbucks or, or dental assistant. You know, like real life jobs? - I have a real life job. - You know, yeah, I, but you actually like your job. - Yeah. I guess I lucked out. - So how did you get into music? - It was my parents really. They were the ones that got me into music when I was young. - Oh, cool. Parents are, are special. - Are you close with your family? - No, I'm not, actually. - Oh, um, can I get you a cup of tea or something hot to drink? - No, I'm fine, actually. - What about a glass of water? - Sure. Yeah, well, that'd be great. - Okay. So what line of work are you in? - I write. A blog. I write a blog. - I didn't know that that was a real job. - Yeah, no, neither did I, until I tried it out. You know, the more people read my stuff the more clicks I get, and that in turn gets me more advertisers and somehow I get a check at the end of the month. - Hey, if it works. - Seems to be. - So what's the blog about? - Uh, basic stuff, relationships, dating that sort of thing, how to meet the person of your dreams. Speaking of which, can I ask you a personal question? - Sure, if it's not too weird. - No, I don't think so. I mean, I just wanted to know about your boyfriend. - Justin. Yeah, what about him? - Uh, how'd you guys meet? And, uh, what does he do? Or where did you guys meet? Sorry, I know that's a really weird question. But believe it or not, there's thousand of guys out there that wanna know answers to questions like that. - Really? - Yeah. - So how does a guy like that get a girl like you? - Well, what's a girl like me? - Come on, don't make me say it. You know, I'm -- I'm the shy type, remember? [Oswald growls] - Ozzie, be nice! Don't worry, he'll warm up to you. - It's cool, all cats hate me. - Don't worry about it. Cats hate everybody, right? - You don't have to answer that question right now. I put you on the spot, I'm sorry. Maybe just think about it? - Sure. - Maybe next time, uh, we could do an interview. And you could shed some light on the whole dating thing for me. My readers would really like it. - Sure, sounds good. Actually maybe you should talk to Justin as well. I mean.. Besides, it'd be cool for you guys to meet. - Yeah, that, that would be great. - And I was thinking earlier I know this really hot violin player, single mom currently looking for the next exciting thing in her life. Maybe the 4 of us could go grab a coffee some time. - That would be, that would be great. I'd, I'd look forward to it. Thank you. - Okay. Oh, John? - Yeah. - I need that. - Oh, yeah, of course, sorry. - And thanks again so much for finding my wallet. - Yeah. Hey, no worries. Okay, I'm really leaving this time. Okay. You're a life saver. - Take care. - Bye. [intense music] Oswald? Ozzie? Oswald! Where is that cat? Oz? Oz? Tch, tch, tch. Here, kitty. Oz, you hiding? Oz? Hey, you hiding? [Oswald shrieking] Oh, no. Stupid little bastard got out again. [thunder rumbling] [intense music] [thunder rumbling] Ozzie. Oswald. Oswald. Ozzie. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. Oswald. [whistling] Kitty, kitty, kitty, come on. Oswald. Oswald. [thunder rumbling] Jesus! Stupid cat. [intense music] I'm sorry. I, I didn't see anybody there. - Why would you? I love the rain. It's invigorating. - Have you seen a cat anywhere? I lost my cat. - You mean your friend's cat? - Yeah. Wait, how did you know that? I -- I've gotta go. - You know, they hate the rain. Cats. It's probably waiting for you at your front door. - Thanks. [intense music] [mews] You have got to be kidding me. Oz. It's just been one thing after another this weekend. - Did you at least see Justin? - Yeah, he came over this afternoon. He's not coming to London with me, by the way. - Is there more you want to tell me about that or.. No, not really. I'll fill you in later. - I see. Dare I say, "Boys will be boys" or does that not apply here? - Nope, it applies. - Well, it's still not too late to find another suitor. - Mum. No. - I'm kidding, dear. Justin is a catch, you should keep him. - I'll be sure to mention that to him. Storm is really kicking in. I'm worried about Justin, he was supposed to come over tonight but he's a no-show. He hasn't even phoned. - There's still time. It's early for you young types. - You're still a spring chick, yourself, mum. Give yourself some credit. - It's not me you have to convince about that it's your father. - Well, he's still with you, isn't he? - Good point. - I talked to David yesterday, by the way. - Oh, good. What did he have to say? Anything interesting? - No, not really. He's just giving me a hard time, as per usual. [thunder rumbling] Great. Hang on, mum. Having a bit of a minor disaster over here. - You want me to have your father come over? - You think he'd mind traipsing across town to rescue his little girl in the rain? - Please, he lives for that sort of stuff. Especially for his little girl. - I don't think dad would ever let me live it down if I couldn't even change a light bulb. - Neither would your brother. - Okay, hold on a sec. - I'm not going anywhere, take your time. [intense music] - Okay, I'm back. - So Carol is coming on Monday. I forgot to mention that on your answering machine. - Who? - David's girlfriend. You remember, she came for Christmas briefly. - Oh! Oh, the biology major. Yeah, I liked her. - Good. Should I be expecting Justin as well? - I hope so, if he can make it. He's just so absorbed in his work. [bulb shatters] Mum, I'm gonna have to call you back. Things are getting pretty hectic over here. - Domestic difficulties getting the best of you? - Yeah, you have no idea. - I can wait. Go do what you have to do. - You sure? - Believe me, I've got nothing better to do as pathetic as it may sound. - Okay. [intense music] [music continues] - Well, what is going on over there? - Oh, nothing, I'm just taking care of a juvenile cat and cleaning up bloody mess. - Well, maybe I should have sent your father, after all. - Oh, I'm glad you're enjoying this. - Immensely. - Okay, oh, voila. - That may be my cue to say goodnight. - Okay, night, mum. - Love you, and so does your father. Let's chat tomorrow. - Okay. Bye. - Goodnight, honey. [intense music] It's late. Justin, where are you? [music continues] [cell phone rings] [intense music] [ringing continues] [ringing continues] [ringing continues] [ringing continues] - This is Justin. Leave a message after the beep. - Justin? - Justin? [cell phone beeping] [beeping continues] [music continues] [beeping continues] [thunder rumbling] [instrumental music] [intense music] [music continues] [sneezing] - Bless you. [intense music] [music continues] [instrumental music] - Hmm. [exhales] Rusty. [intense music] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [dramatic music] [music continues] - Somebody! Help me! Anybody! [instrumental music] Help! [intense music] - Here's your food. - Thank you. - Yeah, you're welcome. - No cookie? - No, not this time. By the way, I, um, I just moved into the neighborhood. [instrumental music] [music continues]
