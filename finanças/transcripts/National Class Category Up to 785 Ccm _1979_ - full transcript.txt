Monday Just look them! I work in the butchery from early morning, but gentleman here doesn't care. Anyway, why would he stood up when there's someone to work for him. Rockafeller also stays up early, to not lose millions. And he? What's up? Do you know what time is it? 11:20 AM. Almost noon. Dragan Nikolic in movie NATIONAL CLASS (Up to 785 ccm) Who received this invitation? What invitation? What is he talking about? Army invitation. Who received and signed it instead of me? How could I know it's an army invitation? I didn't. You are sleepin', mother doesn't let me to wake you up. Someone must sign. And don't bang with that door, this is not a stall! I repeat this for the last time: You will not receive any kind of invitations or letters in my name. I won't. Is that clear? Wait, you didn't ate. I'm not hungry! He doesn't eat anything. Just look him. Army will fix it properly! What army? Have you been doin' something... If anyone can go to army, he can too, after 27 years of foolin' around. Who's that hard-headed one, who always sleeps 'till noon? Who's that world class handsome guy, for whom crowd is crazy? He's wise, brave, he drives, that's the way! He's wise, schizo, brave, drives crazy! Go ahead lowlifes, drive those wrecks! Cattle will never learn to drive. Who is guy in extasis when he steps to over 100? His reflex is like a lightning, flock of chicks is chasing him He's wise, brave, he drives, that's the way! He's wise, schizo, brave, drives crazy! Howdy, cruel punks! Hi! Have you seen Papi? What Papi? You don't know him? -No. That friend of mine. The one who always sits alone here. That somber guy who lunches here? Yes, him. -We didn't saw him. Would you tell him to wait me here, I must go to mechanic, I'll be back in a half of hour? If we'd be here. What are we, your couriers? Don't trick me, will you? I'll be back in a half of hour. And then, me and him will take you to some place. See you in a half of hour. -Bye. He's crazy! Here, Brana, this is the proof that I'm not making it up. First, you brought verification from Faculty of Economy. Then from Faculty of Veterinary. Then from Faculty of Political Science. Then you brought... God knows from where from Faculty of Gymnastics. Then your father came three times to delay, allegedly you've been prevented because of studying, then father came again and said that you don't study at all and that we call you in army. Please don't, uncle Rade. Just give me one month, I've enrolled entrance exam in Faculty of Dramatic Arts. If you didn't anything with veterinary, you wouldn't with drama too. What's that? -For theater, movie and... C'mon. Studying to be an actor? Brana, don't fool yourself. Well, better you go to army, anyway it's sorely time. Uncle Rade, it's only for a month... Don't call me 'Uncle' just because I'm your father's friend, at saturday you must report to unit. Wait! I can't go to army. Really. I'm sick. OK, when you come to unit, appeal and they will heal you. But uncle Rade... - I'm not uncle for you. -OK, sorry. I'm sick and... I want to be examinated. What is with you? I'm sick, everything hurts me. What hurts you, which disease you have? Here hurts me, everything hurts me here. Why you looking trouble, Brana? They would probably stick you a simulant. No, I would glad go to army, but I'm sick. I haven't sleep for ages, I can't eat at all. OK. Here is an advice. In friday you must be here with results. If you don't show up, I'll send you military police, then you won't have time to put your pants on, you will go straight to barracks, is it clear? Clear, but friday doesn't fit me, I'm applying exam in academy... Maybe some day after sunday. What apply? Are you sick or not? I am, but... So, what you want? I want nothing, just... I thought if it can... No, it can't. Friday. Come on, racer, get lost from the canal. That woman is coming, I didn't even touched her car. Just one second, I can't come close... Do you have key 16? What you're gonna do with key 16? My expert, you don't know a shit. I hit my head because of you. Bring me key 13, and round key 32. If that woman shows up and see me working on your wreck, and her car isn't even touched... We just have to look at flange, I will settle it myself. Bullshit, you couldn't settle it before the dark. It's dead broken. Can it handle? Maybe day or two, but maybe kicks the bucket behind first angle. They don't sell flange without half-axis, so fuck... Well, you drive two or three days like this and when it brokes... Then we'll find a solution. Come on, Zile. If I qualify in top 3 at saturday, I'll be first in overall standings. Then ''Modrica'' puts me in Optima Racing Team. It's fixed already. Here's that woman for her car. Shilja! Hey, look... I can't come right now. I got some things to do. Yes, it's car, so? Fuck it, Shilja, if you don't want to... What? Who swears? Call the cab, I'll pick you later. You exaggarate, really. You made fool out of me every time. Like, just some trifle on your car, next minute I'm doing your wreck instead of customer's car. This is firm, for Gods sake. Take a look on tires. They're abrasive a bit. There's no patterns. But even if I got money, our jerks doesn't produce 125x12. You got those ''Tigar's'' 135x12. They'll do the job. Move this shit, come on! Hey, what about those chicks you've promised to me? They wait me at ''Shuma'', everything is settled! Young chicks, eh? -Perfect meat! At saturday I'll bring them to the race, then we'll take them to some place. You'll fell on the ass when you see them. Bye! -Bye! Simke! Simke! Bums! What? Are you said to me? -Keep up. Stop! Hey, stop! Comrade Chabor! Comrade Chabor! Shilja, sorry, I'm in total madness, everything came up suddenly. I've been waiting you here like an idiot. What could I do, fuck it, I have to go to army department. Don't swear, people are listening. -OK. What happened? Take me home, we must talk. OK, but first we've to drop by to academy to see when I'm reposing. And to Simke for cash. Come on, Shilja, hurry! Hey, buddy... What's happening, I've applied, gave 'em application and I'm not on the list? They are all for exam? Why, aren't enough of them? 146 students applied and they accept only 8. Oh, fuck... Doesn't matter, I'm here just to avoid the army. Where can I see what to read, which declamation and stuff? Why you need declamation, it's for those fools up there on acting... This is direction. That's it, I'm in acting. You're for acting? Why, what's wrong? Nothing, sorry... Acting is up there. On the floor. It's me here. So, all of this we have to study? Read, it's written, I don't know anything more than you. How about we meet tonight so I could rewrite from you? I didn't brought pencil nor paper... Let me finish, I will borrow you, then. So, you write in Roman Latin? Well, you're good with letter 'SHJ'. Are you said something? I'm Brana. Friends call me Floyd... Perhaps I look-a-like Martin Floyd. Who is he? You didn't heard for Martin Floyd? Formula 1 driver, ring any bells? Never heard of. Did you watch on TV... Monaco Grand Prix, when he smashed himself? I didn't watch it. It's a shame. You miss alot. Think so? Do you want this pencil or not? I will rewrite tonight. Then, how is your name? Senka (Shadow). Senka... I came here by car, so... If you want to the city, I'll give you a ride. Alright... But I'm here with friend, can he go with us? OK. Let's go. There's my machine. C'mon Bata, we got transport. Good afternoon, professor! -Hi, Bunuel. These are friends of mine, from Academy. We'll give them a ride, huh? I'm Senka, and this is... Bata. Take me home. Take me home, please. Hey, let's have some coffee! -OK. We're going to Ushce. I want home. Relax, Shiki, just a little coffee at Ushce and we go then. OK, huh? I've applied just because of army, maybe I won't even show up there, who fucks it anyway? Don't swear, please. Who swears, what did I say? I passed the tests 4 times, but they knocked me 4 times in oral exam. This is my 5th. Why they bother you so much? -Oh, well... Maybe she's feeling sick because of ride? She was my subdriver at rally. No sick at all. So, what kind of jerks, eh? Everything would be great if I didn't mentioned Bunuel. Who's that guy? You know, Bunuel... Spanish director. ''Andalucian dog'', ''Viridiana''... -Oh, I know. And that guy fucked you up? -Branislav! How do you feel, Shilja? I'm good. -You see. This is how it was... I accidentally mentioned Bunuel, and they attach and say: ''Very good...'' ''Tell us something about Bunuel guy.'' I was thinking and thinking, whether I should be honest, or made up something, so I decide: ''I'll be honest'', and then I said 'em: That he's a plagiator, that he's a compilator, that he directly stole ideas from Eisenstein and Feuillade, that he's guilty for Crisis of Avant-garde, and they knocked me down. Really? Villains... Next year I showed up, they recognize me, and... Bunuel. I think again... I'm not fool, of course... I repeat everything from last year, and normally they knock me again. So, everything best about Bunuel. Don't worry, it's question for directors, they won't ask you that. Excuse me. What study your girlfriend? She studying for acting, but she's not my girlfriend. We learn together. Hey, what have you searching here? What time tonight? -Oh... You want to get something from the outside? Why from outside? She's not my girlfriend. We're seeing each other casually. Get out! Some woman will come in and have a stroke if she sees you here. So what? How about by ''Shumatovac'' at 7 o'clock? Deal? Let's go Shiki, Papi waits me in ''Shuma''. C'mon hurry up, you know I must go later to Simke for cash. 57 dinars. Hey buddy, pay this, I'm in a hurry. Bye. It's OK. C'mon Shiki, I'll be late! How we gonna back to the city, to swim over or what? I'm driving you home, as soon I pick up money for tires from Simke. OK, then I'll call the cab. I wanted to spoke with you in peace, like humans. Alright Shiki, just after I drop by for money. You can't imagine how it's important to me, I'm driving races at saturday, if I qualify... I don't care! Comrade Chabor! It's him! Simke, open! Stop! Who, me? -Yes, you. What is this, Simke? Get lost, you fool! Police... I've shite my pants. Go out! Police! Some fool, he drives crazy whole building. What? -Simke, I need urgently 300,000. How could I give you when I invested? I must emerge. Tires are dead, and at saturday I'm driving races. Pal, just wait for two days, you'll get it double. What's this? Glue, eh? Of course. That's the business. Kids in my disco sniffin' like crazy. Never heard of. Look, I wouldn't bother you but it's snort. OK, we'll think out something. Come tomorrow night at disco. OK, I'm going. Papi waits me, we're juggling something about army. What's up, soldiers are chasing you? Bye. I'm coming tomorrow. Bye. -Bye. So, why don't you say 'Bye'? Some maniac attacked me. What maniac? -That one over there. What wanted he? I don't know, he yelled about some crash, I didn't understood nothing. What he wants, what's happening here? I don't realize nothing. What kind of idiots! Do you hear how flange is banging? I don't care at all! Please, take me home! -Alright, ?iki. We go to ''Shuma'', sit for awhile, chat and then I'm taking you home. You wanted to talk, have you? Don't be such a jerk, Floyd, 5 hours we're sitting here. The guy came, lunched, waited for an hour and then left. Do you know how much he waited? Do you even know when you left? What should I do now? He said he'll be here tomorrow at noon. Wait a second... You've promised us some crazy fun... -Yeah, where? Be here tomorrow at noon, then me and Papi will take you. You're lying, as soon you open your mouth. I'm lying? And at saturday, where I'm taking you? And with whom? To the races. And I'll meet you with some maximum dude. Fuck, it's 6 PM. Bye! I wanna sit. What I'm gonna do, Silja, there is no places, look yourself! Don't shout. Here is Slave, wanna sit with him? I won't. I want once to sit alone. How, Shilja, do I have to born table? Fuck!! What shall I do? Don't swear. I go to Slave to ask him about racing apply. Wait here. Hi. -Hey, could I look machine? Tuesday Son... Wake up, son... Brana? -What is it? One man came, he says you two were crashed, he's been to father's butchery as well. He says he's gonna call the police. Get up, son. Come on. I know, but what I have to do with it? I don't drive, I even got no licence. That's not my business, I went to P.D., show them your plate number, they told me where you're living, and your name. Are you the owner of the car? -I am. That's because I've been raising a loan, but my son is driving a car. Let him pay, what I'm gonna do with it? That's your business: Father or son, I got nothing to do with it. Did your car made damage to mine? It is. Hey, where are you going? We don't have it. Only for 850cc model. OK, Djole, who could possibly have a flange? I don't know. Please? I need... -You got phone here? Which part? -That rubber one which comes from underneath. Shilja? My flange is broken. That thing which banged yesterday. Anyway, my car is broken, standing in the middle of the street. Yes. I need car like a food, I'm in deep shit, Shiki. Yes? Come on Shiki, leave the swearing now. Look... Could you ask your father to borrow me his car this afternoon? Please Shiki, ask him... or I'm totally fucked up. Hello? Here, in the pocket are driving licence and insurance policy. This is key for steering wheel and trunk, and this one is for lock. This small one is for tank, but be careful, it doesn't have much fuel. You must pour it immediately. Thank you very much, I will return you car as soon as I... Tomorrow is OK. I don't go to the city today. -Thanks. Oh, and speeds are going in H - First up-left, second... I know, I know... You will teach me about the speeds. Sorry? Nothing, I said 'Thanks, uncle Moma'. Shile... I'm going to move the car. What's wrong? Are you mad because I've asked your father for a car? What is it? I'm pregnant and I'll give a birth. How? Aren't you took pills? I ceased three months ago. Why? Are you nuts? First, don't raise your voice. Second, doctor banned me. And third, if I do abortion one more time, it may happen I never get pregnant again. Listen, Shilja, we must think a bit. I thought already. -I know, but if... How do you feel? OK, we agreed. I go now, then I'll call you after lunch. Bye, aunt Milica. Which trick you thought we could use? Glomerulonefritis cronica. How? That's kidney failure. They release from that, I checked it personally. Oh, no... You got something else? Except you want to act faggot, you want that? Stop kidding me. Where you got those trolls? I've promised them we're gonna take 'em somewhere. If you want, we can score them right now, huh? Are you nuts? Who knows when they took shower last time. They're really trolls. I got one enthusiast for them. Listen... For me it's to be or not to be, how do you think we manage this? Hardly. First, you must drink some shit which fucks up urinary canals. It's because of scanner. What I have to drink? -You better don't know. I'm telling you it's not easy. You must have guts if... -OK, OK. So, they scan me, then what? Over, eh? Then they give you urine bottle. You piss, then you give 'em urine back, they research it, and in a half of hour they determine... this kidney failure. Then it's over. Zoki? Wait, I piss and... Be quiet, moron! OK. That's the catch, dude. You don't piss, but our man, real kidney patient. It's OK. Do I know this guy? I doubt. Some Mile Rent-a-Kidney. I don't know. Which way now? -Straight ahead, then left. Some ordinary guy. I take him to disco, to some company. What can I do? I can't just force him to piss instead of others. So, he done it before? Of course, he knows everything. Park there. He got some pidgeons, he plays with them for a whole day. What's up? Come down, would you? I can't right now. You climb up here. Listen, you must be sort of buddy with him. He wants to render a favor, really... But you have to be kind with him, to hang together and stuff. Where should I took him? I don't know... Somewhere, to show him your car for instance, until we manage this. Hi, Mile. Come on in. Do you know who's this? It's Floyd, racing champion. Hi. Are you Branimir Mitrovic? I am. It was in the papers about you... when you were... on two wheels. Yes, in ''Ilustrovana Politika''. Sorry, Mile... I'm interrupting you... Listen, Floyd needs release of army. So, if we could do the same thing like with Cvetko? OK, why not. How are you feeling? Is it hurt you? It doesn't hurt now, I'm taking some medication. How? -Well, I'm feeling a little bit better. Listen, if you could stop taking those medications, just for a while... It's no problem, I could do it. Great. -Hey... Mile. -Mile... Are you free in saturday? Because I drive some races, and I need a subdriver, so if you wanna... Mile is cool, I'm telling you. C'mon, we must go. Bye. -Bye. I know this path like my pocket. I beat jackasses here anytime. So, what you gonna tell them? What you've been preparing? Nothing. What do I have to prepare? Just tell them something. What? One of those declamations... Which declamation? Why everything must be by their will? I'll go in front of and tell them: Like... ''You were came here to choose 5-6 most talented out of 180 of us.'' ''Of course, by your oppinion.'' ''And we're shaking in the halls like last wretches,'' ''no matter that this exam exists because of us.'' ''Then you give us 5 minutes to stutter something, what else we could do'' ''some song, to quickly seal our destiny.'' ''Anyway, you got paid for it. You don't care because isn't your ass...'' Don't foolin'. They could kick you out... Why not to say? What they now about me? And about us too? Do you think that they've ever thought that some of us, not necessary me, have to escaped from home because of this exam and rumble across from friend to friend, sleeping in rented rooms, and doesn't remember the last time he eat something bisky... You've really escaped? What do you think? No, really. -If I look like someone who escaped, then I am. If I don't, then I ain't. You're cool, Senka. What is it, cocksucker? Come back, I'll show you! Did you saw the maniac? Let's go to disco, friend of mine have to give me my money back. Let's go. Hey, cruel punks! Hi! -What's up, liar? Why liar? And that thing at saturday? You're lying us again. Me? And that guy I've promised you? Which guy? -Well, Zika, man of your dreams. Just one word with Simke, I'll be back. Hi. Go dance a bit. Go dance! They're really sniffin' glue. Thanks man, you pull me out. Stayin'? No. Chick waits me in car. Shilja? -No. Some bird from faculty. Bye! Look yourself you're not a child. Where to? I don't know. Whassup? -I wanted to ask you something. Nevermind. C'mon tell me, what is it? I remembered that you need that cash for tires. Nevermind, I'll borrow. You need cash? How much? Landlady bothers me, she requires rent two months ahead. She'll pay in for me these days... -HOW MUCH? 300. But she'll pay in. What's that? Can your tires resist 'til friday? I'll give you back. They must. We couldn't at your place? Oh, no. I got full house of some relatives. So at your's, is it inconvenient because of landlady? Not really. But I'm sharing a flat with roommate. Let's go, it doesn't matter. OK. Don't pay attention, she sleeps like dead. Hey? Why you're turning off? Light disturbs me. What's wrong? I have the impression that she's watching us. Wednesday Oooh, it can't... It doesn't match. This is flange with small eartips. Yes Zile, but they said it can be shoved. Did they? Then, let shove it to you the one who told you that. I can't. Take this. Zile, save me, for God's sake. If we don't fix this shit, we'll never rid of National class. Move this freak from the canal, quickly! Why would I give a shit about your National class! Are you nuts? You idiot. Move this! Put that on the ground, what you staring at?! It can shove it, it can. I must remove the wheel, then drum, then branch, then half-axis, and only then I can shove it. Do you know how much work it is? I will do it myself, you just supervise. What you are gonna do yourself? You'd made just a bigger shit. Give me that flange. Here you are. Who's this guy? Some dude. I take him to watch races. Yes, you are big expert, you need apprentice as well. Floyd, some man is looking for you. Oh, not again. What is it now? Well, comrade Brana, this is not my duty, but I think this have to be resolved between two of us in a civilized, human way. I've met your father, but he won't accept... What he won't accept? Here it is. It's written all here. What is it, what's written? That's the traffic accident you made in New Belgrade, when you hit my Skoda. Are you heard him? It's same every day. Sorry, comrade Brana, maybe it's Skoda, but it's mine. If you want witness, I could bring him, too. Hi, buddy! Hi. Preparing for exam, eh? Hey, buddy, do you know something about direction? I've applied just because of verification, but if I'm gonna impose already, I don't want to look like complete moron. So, if you want help me to pick something, I have no clue what to choose. Do you know anything? I know some things we've must learn in elementary school, those poemes and stuff. I know that folk song: ''Marriage of Milic the Flagbearer.'' Those songs with same beginnings: ''Lovely God, oh what a miracle'' that's when Milic get married, and then he search whole country for a chick. Like, he can't find a chick... It's bullshit, isn't it? It's a little bit historic. And ''Barbara''? That's good. Prevert's? -Yeah. I know that. When he says: ''I didn't knew you, you didn't knew me, too'' ''we were laughing together''... then, well...uh... It finishes ''It's still raining over Brest today, it's just isn't like before.'' Is it bad? -That's OK, but you must learn it properly, of course. And when you are there, let be normal, like in life... Like our conversation right now, like me explaining to you. Like it's nothing... -I don't care really. Say, will you see Senka soon? We agreed to go to cinema tonight and watch ''Battleship Potemkin''. The one with Steve McQueen and that blonde? No, man... Russian movie, Sergey Eisenstein's. What's wrong, did someone died? Hi, Brana. Sorry I've drop by unannounced. Understand me. For God's sake. If you have to announce, then... Drop anytime. -I will, thanks. I made these by myself, they're domestic. Take it. -No, please. You don't have to bother. -Please, take them. Well, thank you. Bye. Say Hello to your daughter. -I will. And to your husband too. Ok, bye. -Carefully. I don't like sausage. He must eat what's on the table, if he won't, he can go to restaurant. Shame yourself, bum! You social parasite! Sit down! Tone! Release the tone! Shut up, idiot! Who said that? Sit down! Senka! Sit down! Hi. Why those pricks don't release the tone? Shut up, this is silent movie. I know, I'm just kidding. I couldn't call you, I've been occupied with race commercials. Wait, I'm really interested in this. Come on. -Enough! What a mounting! Wherefrom you, which way you entered? Remember, I got spare keys. If I'm disturbing you... I'll be over in a second. Don't bother, we're living not far from here. Why, I would give you a ride. Don't bother. Bye then. I wouldn't want to disturb you, but you promised to dad you'd return his car yesterday. But, when I saw the car... I've really won't to spoil your evening. OK, we'll return daddy's car immediately. Don't raise your voice, I hear well. You know what? I don't want to be your drag, 'cause I feel I am for a long time. I've noticed that you're nervous in my presence... I'm not nervous at all. Yes, you are. Because you don't love me, and you feel committed. Only thing which is linking us now is that me and my family can be useful for some practical stuff of yours. What are you going to say with that? It is clear for me long time ago. Well, you see, in the meantime, when you were chasing bearings, rims, crankshafts, and those whores in the way, I realized that I don't love you anymore as well. That I served the sentence of 3.5 years, standing in the shadow of ordinary little car. And that I've got enough. That you or me shouldn't feel commitment to each other. Well... It's over. And what about... You mean about kid? It's my business. You got nothing with it. How nothing, damn it? You will never swear in front of me again. Is it clear? Drive me home. Dad said you can keep the car today, but tomorrow you must return it at once. Thursday There are the earlier hits, but you'll determine what is whacked later. Where is whacked? That's your job to say. Show me what should I look. How could I know how it came to damage. Well, I'm... -Please, Mr. Brana, without influences on responsible person. If need, I have witness as well. -Cukon Emilija. Stop, comrades, it can't that way... Hey, buddy, say any price, he persecute me for days. I don't want to participate in this. Why police didn't investigate? How to investigate, when nothing has happened, I've just... You see, fellow. I have to be the cover. Find some other fool for this! Comrade Brana... Empty, eh? Fuel meter doesn't work. How much? Can you pour for 1,800? We don't pour below 3 litres. I got short on the way home, I will return... I told you, we don't pour below 3 litres. What kind of human are you? I didn't brought money from home. Who is it? Aunt Nata, it's me, Brana. Which Brana? Brana, son of Smilja and Strahinja. Which Smilja? Your niece Smilja, Jula's daughter. Oh, Smilja! Why didn't you said so? Brana! I haven't seen you since you were kid. Mom send me just for one favor, then I must go. What's wrong? Dad fell sick this morning, and they took him to hospital. But we ain't got a nickel at home, and something we must give to nurse which takes care of him. Is it heart? It is. Is it dangerous? It is. Everything could befall a human. Wait. Is he sick for a long time? No. He doesn't even know he's sick. They didn't told him that he not get upset. Well, here, tell mom that I have no much, just 10,000. My pension will came at thursday. Thanks. Oh, God, Brana... Look how grown are you. Have you finished the school? Long time ago. I'm student now. Bye. Bye. Say hello to daddy! I will! Move this shit, we're working here! Is it OK, Zile? It'll be OK. Only if you want me to wash it, it's dirty. Oh, don't. You bum! -You're big-hearted, Zile! I've done this for you now, and never again. No more National class. From saturday it's over. What was said that woman, what problem... -Zile, I almost forgot. You coming at saturday? What would I do if something goes wrong? I'm working. Some people must eat, you know. And chicks that awaits us? What chicks? -You pullin' my leg? I've said I provided meat. I've been heating them for days, and you now... Saturday, 11 AM, deal. Bye. C'mon Mile, you know I need to return car to Shilja's dad. Sit in Fica and drive behind me. Hey, Floyd... What? I don't know how to drive. What do you mean you don't know? Whom I taking for subdriver... Sit there. Turn the key. No, to the right. This at right is gas pedal. Step a bit! OK, enough. That in the middle are brake, it's the most important part of the car. Enough! This at left is clutch. I know, it's coupler. It's not coupler, it's a clutch. That shit next to hand is transmission. First speed is up-left, second is down-left, third is... You don't need anymore, drive behind me, look what I'm doing! I'll late for the races! I completely forgot on tires! C'mon, Mile, what are you doing?! What happened? Have you remembered his plates number? What number, I hardly save my ass alive! I'll come soon, Brana. Serve yourself. You got some cookies on the table. Thanks, I drove uncle Moma's car. How do you feel? -Leave me alone! Brana? Uncle Moma is asking you to go to him, he have something to chat with you. All right. Where's Shilja? She's lying up there, doctor banned her to stay out of bed. I didn't knew that this thing between you two went so far. I don't want to agitate, but I also won't let this thing to got proportions which no one wants. My wife told me that some complications occured, but also that she wants to born at any price. That's why I decided to help. As much as I could. You could live here for a start. In this garden house. But it needs to be decorated, and to fix the bathroom. While you wait to get apartment. I'm ready to help with finances in start, but it can last only while you're in the army. As soon as you get back, we must do everything to find you a good and well-paid job. Wife told me that you're driving? True. I'm driving in National class but I will probably enter the higher one. I'm in the Traffic Security Committee. Can I help you in any way? Really? Those people from association have three Alpine's which collect dust 6 months already, they don't know what to do with them. At association? How is it called? Alpine. It's a pimped, I mean tuned BMW. OK. We'll see. Uncle Moma, it's great! I really obey all standards, but it's impossible to talk with them... Stay for lunch, we'll talk about it. All right. You drive, eh? I'm joking a bit. Is it all theirs? You have to see inside. Brana, it's lunchtime. I'd call you, but... -You just go. You go, I'm not hungry anyway... Would you lock the car? Wait me here, we have to meet Papi later about that thing tomorrow. All right, I'll wait. Hey Floyd? Did you saw the way I entered the curve at ''Mostar''? I've been to hospital and checked it everything. You can piss in their toilet, too. You must acting like you feel unpleasantly... How? -Like, you can't in front of nurse. Invent something, I don't know. Who are those idiots of yours? Get lost. Out! Out! Mile, you're going with me to the urinal. You must drink this first in the morning. It's disgusting, but hold on. What's this, what you gave me? When you've planned we go? -Just bind this. Friday Where are you goin'? To Shilja's parents. They invited us. What are you doin' at Shilja's home? You will determine us where should we go? And now you bring them sausages and flowerpots for a gift? Why not. You have no idea about quality of those at markets, even cats wouldn't eat them. I must bring something, I can't go empty-handed. He doesn't giving me a nickel. How do I look? Let's go. What's wrong, Mile? I can't. How? You want some water? I drank 100 liters this morning. Wait a second. He can't piss. What is this you gave me to drink? I'll die here. Here it is! Is it going? Here, dude. Spill it now! What happened? Nothing. It didn't work out. They figured it? I'm healthy. Healthy? But how, were they took the urin? In fact, he's healthy. How...? -Like that. They say, ''He suffered of kidney disease, but treatment has gave improvement.'' I'm healthy. In fact, you are. Impossible! Why you didn't said? Look what you done to him. Where's doctor? Where are you going? We would fucked up all, you moron! Floyd, I didn't knew, I swear, I wouldn't trick you... Listen, dude... I was able to release you whenever I wanted to. I would be ashamed of it, really. ''...I'm writing you, what could I know better... and what could I say more to you,'' ''Now it depends on your will, if I'd gain your contempt.'' ''But if my fortunes bothers you, even shooks you a bit...'' Senka! Wait, Senka. What happened, did you pass? If I'm looking to you like someone who passed, then I am... Really, I'm serious. You again with your 'really', like that's important. Where you will go now? -Home. Where else? Is she had to gave us money for the tires? What are we gonna do now? I don't know. They'll hold. How would I know? If it don't rain. Branimir Mitrovic! Hey, this guy has the same name as you. Is there some Mitrovic here? Let's go home, I feel sick. Hey, did you went to exam? What happened? Well... I passed. You want more? He got pain in stomach. Big deal. Who knows what he's been eating. Do you hear him sobbing? Leave that now. Do you want to throw you one more pan? -No, thanks. If that Brana told me we're having guests, I would... You'll pack him to bring home. I made them by myself. Are you an adult? How do you mean? I'm 25. No, I mean do you have I.D.? I got. -All right. It doesn't matter now. Are Brana told you something about his wife? No. He's marrying? He went yesterday to propose a bride, wedding is at sunday. Now, day after? Yes, her father got contacts in municipality. I don't know nothing. The only problem is: The best man. So I thought, if you want to be. Well I... We know each other for only 3 days. It's important that you're honest man. Young. And correct. Not like those didders of his. That homo Simke and that gangster, how they call him... Papika. It's big honour for me, but... Maybe would Floyd want to take some better friend for a best man. We don't know each other very well. It's a deal! Smilja, give that schnapps. No, please! I shouldn't. Give us brandy! -No, doctor banned me strictly. You won't drink alone? Yeah. Just a bit, eh? -No, please. You're really pale. Best man... Mile! Mile, come! I'm coming. What is the old man fudging? He ask me to be the best man. Best man? To whom? -To you. He said that you're marrying and that you went yesterday to propose a bride. I went to propose a bride? -Yes. And when I, like, marry then? At sunday. At sunday. Yes. And what is today? Friday. Friday. Friday! Brana! Where you going sick like that?! Good afternoon! Wherefrom you, aunt Nata? Well, I've heard about Strahinja, that he's sick, so... You ain't in hospital? When you came? You were really ill. Yes, I'm draggin' it for a long time. You will rebirth in army. Clear air, early to bed, early staying up... I hope so. OK then, I'll check in to unit tomorrow... Look Brana, you know that I'm your father's friend, but also that job is sacred to me and I don't mix it with friendship. I know... -I ain't soft with anyone specially. But your father came yesterday and told me about that wedding at sunday. I told him: ''You can ask me everything, but not that kind of stuff.'' ''Kid received invitation for saturday, so he must go.'' But when he displayed me situation, which is urgent, I had called the ministry. And I present them situation. I said them, your father is square man, and that you are good youngster as well, and they approved. What they approved? -For monday. Uncle Rade, I won't joke with army, I'll go tomorrow. Don't worry, everything is arranged, show there in monday, till 24 hours. That much we can understand. I know, but... -There is no 'but'. Monday, till 24h. Comrade Rade, here's your coffee. -Thanks, Markovic. You know very well what means poll position in this kind of tracks. In case that Slave strike in first position at start, you all others pay attention to drivers of ''Jedinstvo'' don't allowing them to break sideward. Wait, Ragazzoni. Who conceived this? It's decision of executive board, why you haven't been at meeting? So, pay attention, just in case that Slave drops off... Gale and Floyd attacks, but I repeat, just in case that Slave drops off. You mean, I'll be Slave's backup? Why not, I have 2 points more than you in overall. So, what? Winner gets 15 points. You think you could be first? Stop bullshit, you always get good round. You think you could win with that wreck? Fuck you, I'll drive tomorrow on my own. Please, please! That's not sportsmanlike. What?! What are you shitting here with some tactics and theories?! Where are you when it needs to step harder on pedal?! And what about meeting of executive board? I don't give a shit! Let him go, he blows up every meeting! -Quiet! You bring us here some fools, who's this guy?! Slave, watch your language. Or we could solve this the other way. You're well known to us for your speed, as a man with bollocks. But in this case his car is in better shape, and he's got 2 points more. I'll cry myself out. And about bollocks, tomorrow I'll give you all chance to graze them, especially him. Some tales are circulating in public more and more, about setups and incorrectness. In those tales is often highlighted name of your club, and not only yours, but also of ''Jedinstvo'' and... It doesn't matter now. But it's last moment to remind ourselves that tomorrow must win knighthood, sportsmanship, fair-play, and not individual nor club. And just because of that, comrade Lazarevic of Traffic Security Committee wished to attend this meeting. Guys... I wish you lot of success. Bye, fellows. Now, start numbers, but one by one. Say, how it calls that... Alpine. -Yes. OK. Listen... You have to drop by to Vukosava (Shilja's real name), she doesn't feel well. And chat with her a bit. -I will... She's now... When she heard about wedding... Go and explain her nicely. I'll surely will, uncle Moma. Oh, God. Listen, Vidoje... Those Alpine's of yours, in Association... when it will be shared? Oh no, rain... Saturday Take a care of him. He's scatterbrain... He'd lose somewhere. Where's No. 6? Don't strive like a madman, drive slowly. C'mon, Mile. Good luck. And don't smash yourself. You jinxer! Ladies and gentlemen, while Miss of the Summer league and her runner-ups drive Honorary Circle I'll inform you that competitors of the Summer league soon will start in this year's last race in National class up to 785cc. In this race participate 12 young and talented drivers. By tradition, in this class participate our best drivers and this is their first master exam. National class was always showing and arguing new talents. All great current aces... What I have to do? Stand over there and listen what Slave and Ragazzoni are talking. How we're holding, Zile? "Barrel will not leak 'till repairers are here", that's how we're holding. Here's your meat. Where? -Over there. Oh, they're groce. They look like you pulled them out of the accumulator. Hi! Doctor, this is... Jasna. -Julien. Nice to meet you. Slavica. -Julien. Nice to meet you. Is this that awesome dude? Why, what's wrong? This is shocking! Hey... Are you interested in something? What you want? I wanted to ask you how much it can develop... How much can... -What to develop? Like you don't know how much it can develop. Get lost, punk! You will spy me, eh? Floyd, if you don't observe of agreement, we'll throw you... I told you what you can do! Don't step on the gas! Leave gas to me, you idiot! Starter is now calling drivers to take their poll positions. Floyd, I couldn't hear anything! Push Mile, I can't start! -OK! Push, ?ika! Best time on training managed driver No.7 Slavoljub Dusanovic ''Slave''. Back! Here is first bad luck. It looks like veteran Milorad Jaksic ''Fangio'', yes, it's him.. No. 4 leads... Second is No. 21... Third is Slave Dusanovic. Next is No. 10, Micunovic from ''Pobeda'', fifth is Brana Mitrovic Floyd. They face the curve. Magnificient ride of Floyd Mitrovic, now he's 4th already, as far as I see from here. Remarkable grit of all competitors, this race decides new champion. Here's Floyd Mitrovic already on 3rd place, he just passing Micunovic from the back. Micunovic is likely drop off the track and he gave up. Floyd stays on the track and continue the race. Excellent tempo, but also dangerous ride. They hit themselves, and Slave Dusanovic, big favorite, drops off. Big shame. Risky, but glamourous ride of Floyd Mitrovic push him one more place up. Now his path to win is entirely open. Move out of here. What's wrong with you, woman, you see that I'm driven out. It's only Shnajder who is trying to force and compensate backlog. Yes, I was right. Shnajder's car cancels. Floyd Mitrovic pass Shnajder at this moment, who didn't had luck. Branimir Mitrovic Floyd, 27 years old, several times within an easy reach of title, mostly because of numerous breakages and discipline penalties, finally within an inch of champion title. Man who's 3 or 4 years at top of Auto Racing, finally got chance to win today and... What is it? -TIRE! But, he also stopped! I don't see from this distance, but it's look like a tire! Mitrovic's tire broke! Shnajder, whom I wrote off too early, removed failure, probably it was just a junction cap, and he's on the track again. Drive on a hubcap, we ain't got time! -PUSH! We won!! Race nullifies! Race nullifies! He pushed him through finish line... Starter proclaims finish of the race invalid. Yes, race nullifies! Sunday Strahinja, stop drinking! Best man? A toast! I wish to... Floyd and his wife that they have nice time, and to be happy in life, and... Long live newlyweds! Long live! Ljubina? Doctor said that she shouldn't fatigue. This wedding appears to be urgent. We should see where children would live. Strahinja, don't force kid to drink, doctor forbid him. No, I can. I recovered. You see? Cheers! -Cheers! What you drink, pal? I don't drink, I drive. Hey, Simke... You have pass at her, guaranteed. Sorry, I forgot. You have to excuse me. I got some important report. Of course, all this have to be painted, then it comes new furniture. I'm amazed. I didn't knew that something like this exists. Please, Strahinja, look at this... Look. You bloody fool! Best man... Fire up! Don't sleep, baby, while the music play, this crazy rhythm doesn't give peace to anyone, Mom is in the bed, she sleeps long ago, no one would know that you're with us, I'll wait you just one more second, honey, then I'll go dance myself. Then I'll go dance myself. Because it's rock'n'roll, baby, it's rock'n'roll, ROCK'N'ROLL!! Monday Good morning! Good morning. -You don't sleep? My train is leaving in an hour. Oh, you travel today. Do you have money for the trip? I do. Well... Nice trip, and write when you got time. I will. Uncle Moma? What happened with that thing we were talking about? What? With Alpine. Alpine? No way. They haven't money to buy them. We'll see when you got back. It will be time. What are you doing here? I said, it's practice to escort you. I couldn't find wagon-restaurant anywhere. Take this oranges, they'll do you good in journey. You shouldn't, I don't eat those often. You'll see, it'll please you well. You know when this train have wagon-restaurant? Never. It haven't. It's some trashy. I got headache, I got badly drank yesterday. What's this? Keys of machine. Small one is for doors, and that big is for contact. What I'm gonna do with them? Drive him a bit, fool around. I got no licence. Shall I transfer him to your wife? -Oh, no. OK, I'll give you when you're back. Go, forget it. Bye! Hey, Floyd! Nice trip! Who's that hardheaded one, who always sleeps 'till noon? Who's that world class handsome guy, for whom crowd is crazy? He's wise, brave, he drives, That's the way! THE END
