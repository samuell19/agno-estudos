It's all right. ? Should I try again? ? No. Do you know who wrote on the walls? ? No, I don't. ? Are you sure? I swear. Get back to work. Fill it yourself if you want. What's the matter? Come on in. In this heat, only rainwater quenches thirst. Your apprentices dirty everything. Don't send them anymore. The pleasure lies in going deep. The apprentices are in a hurry... Let me show you. "Farfat isn't a man" Damn you! I've put up with you long enough. Take you junk somewhere else! Don't come again, who do you think you are? That's enough. Aren't you ashamed of yourself? Tell him! Move aside, you're good for nothings! Go to bed. We don't want any scandal. Am I to blame? And you dare take his side! I've always commanded respect, and here you are degrading me! You've become a laughing stock. You're hopeless. Forget it! Let him get drunk, he never gives anything to my brothers. He takes it out on me, in front of people. They can slander my name... I don't care. I don't owe anyone anything. I don't ask for favours. I can curse, too. Damn this city! That's enough; there's a bed here. Your father worked all night. Anything would get on his nerves. Forget it. Here? Do you think I can ever forget? I've only forgotten my school days. Anis, come on. Leave us alone. Farfat's things. Let us work in peace. Finished with Sfax. I'll go to South. You have to know where you are heading. What about Tunis? Rochdi came back right away. I don't like Tunis. That's all. Hey! What a surprise! I've come to settle things with you. Why all this hurry? I'm leaving for Tunis. Is Sfax too small for you? ? You'll end up in jail. ? Thanks a lot. Enough of that talk. Let people work. Pay me and you'll never see me again. 200 dinars in all. You're really making a mess of your life. You're still hanging around? I know it's urgent. I've 30 dinars. Take it and we're square. Shove it! You can go to hell! Your boss isn't a "man". Well, if you say so! Farfat, come with us. Hachemi, Jacko; wait for me! Hachemi! A crab bit me. Unload quickly, you guys. Come and help us, Hachemi. By Monday, we'll have 2000 chairs. The bridegroom is afraid to come in. Aren't you going to say hello? You frighten me. Oh, no! Not again! Nothing, a little tired. I need some money. Come and say hello, they've come to see you. That's all I have. I want to be the most beautiful. You will be the most beautiful. Don't you see it's crooked? Hachemi has such a white skin, he should have been a girl. On the wedding night, I want to be sure he'll be man enough. I want to be sure. Does it take you an hour to buy cigarettes? The change? Where's the change? Ameur! Something wrong? Come, Hachemi! Don't be afraid. Ah, Emna. Are you running away from someone? When exactly was I expelled from school? I was too young to remember. Do you remember Jacko? I remember Rosa. Jacko used too call me his fiance. I was so ashamed. Too bad they left. Have you noticed those villas everywhere? People are moving away. Are your aunts spending the night? I'm afraid you'll forget us. Your wife is rich. What are you looking for? I'm looking for my book. Keep serving. The men first. That can wait. My nightmare was meaningful. What's this photo? Have you seen your in-laws? Take a sedative. A little consideration for the guests. That's good. That's too much; you're such a spendthrift. ? Eat. ? Repeat it, please. Not in front of the men. When did Habib die? It seems such a long time ago. Alas! He was reminiscing. There was the suit, the shirt and around the neck? A bib? Don't handle it, you'll bring bad luck. Smile a little. You're so up-tight. Does the bride frighten you that much? The first night, you'll get the better of her, then it'll be over. She's sweet! There's no more respect. Have you invited your friends? But we have to know. Answer me when I speak. Can't you hear me? Speak! I don't know. You're the one getting married, it's not me! Oh yes, Ameur dropped by. I invited his whole family. ? Why? ? Have you forgotten what you owe him? I haven't forgotten anything. I've paid in full. A little respect. Is the wedding turning your head? Take a sedative. They expelled me from school, was I a dunce, a fool..? My dear son. Some rosewater; I feel faint. Bring everything in. Cover the baklaoua. Oh you saints, don't abandon me now. I promise a visit... A sacrifice and blood will flow. Don't make a scene. You're very lucky. Your father has paid for everything. That doesn't give him the right to shout. He's stirred up everyone. Don't listen. You're the groom. The groom! That's easy to say. Stop belittling yourself. He treats me like a child. You talk like Farfat. You could be twins. Farfat in unlucky; he'll end up badly. There's no one here. Be careful, I'm watching you. We're not children. Only go to Farfat's room. You can't take it with you when you go! Come down and work. Did you go back home? Leave me alone. I love to be up high. I love to fly. I envy you. Hachemi. I feel hemmed in. I'd love to go far away and leave it all behind. But where would you go? It's madness to leave. It's madness to stay. It's 12 years old. Let me take it. No, you'll lose it. Look, and Jacko in those glasses, pretending he's grown up. He liked doing it. And you, you pretend you're still a child. You talk like the old folks. Did you see my vacant look? You'll never change. Ever a child. That's strange. Are you frightened or you just frighten others? Why should I be afraid? Don't get so upset! My name isn't Ameur. I'm not afraid of him. He was always hanging around us and we used to run away. Stop talking about it. Say it, say it. You're jealous. You've nothing to be jealous of. I've married off all my children and well, too. You say there's another woman. I never said that. Aren't you ashamed of yourself? It's your aunt. Why doesn't she go home? But I am home. This is my father's place. It's not your night, Farfat, bad luck. Do you know the tale of the sleeping beauty? I don't have the heart for that now, go to sleep. Wake me up if Hachemi comes. He must be bewitched. He's never been so late. He's of age now. Did you see how disrespectful he was to his farther? I didn't notice. I'm afraid for you. ? Of what? ? Of the cold. ? Farfat, you're a real brother. ? Of milk or of beer? I'm afraid I'll get picked up. I'll take you home. Don't misunderstand him. I want to know who wrote on the walls. You don't deserve that. If I catch the one who did it! I'll tear him to pieces. It was me. Tear me to pieces. Who has put his friends to shame? It's Farfat. The source of evil? It's Farfat. Of degeneration? It's Farfat. Of perversion? Depravity? The devil, it's Farfat. Always Farfat. Poor Farfat, they've got your number. Alas! Friendship is cruel. Farfat... Farfat. It's over, Farfat. You've been buried alive. Come back, you'll drown. So what? I've no father. I heard his voice. It's daylight. I don't have the heart for that. I'm thinking of my son. He's disappeared. Money-grubber! Farfat, got a cigarette? They're all wet. The customs officer confiscated a packet. Why were they after you? Do you want us to teach them a lesson? No, they're friends. Do you want to take that boat. Did you get a look at that? Everyone's watching us. She's doing it on purpose. I'll never get married. I'm not as lucky as you. I sometimes come early to catch a glimpse. He would never listen to me. You can make him understand. Unless you're afraid of him. I risk losing my job. Stop sniveling. You're the one who's complaining. He's our friend, no? Are you still sleeping? Keep that for me. My father hasn't paid me since the motorcycle was stolen. It was Farfat's fault. I steal from my father to get drunk. What's friendship! Even blood ties no longer mean anything. To hell with the motorcycle... I respect my father. When one grows a mustache... Childhood days are over. That's what it means to be a man? You're always talking about the motocycle. Have you forgotten all he's done for you? Even then I was already a man. He destroyed everything. Who would have believed it? Friendship, eh... Even when burned to ashes a little always remains. It's money that's bothering you. Don't rub salt into the wound. Stop worrying about him, think of yourself. And look forward to the warmth. Forget our misery, our cold beds. The long nights, the thirst. You've found warmth and you worry about others. Forget all this. Enjoy life. Before it's too late. At my age, I'm still an innocent. Hachemi, try those. Have you seen the film "Maschite"? I'm going to see it on Monday. Who tore your shirt? Were you fighting again? Put your hand on the Koran and swear. Why did you leave your job? If you're lying, God will punish you. "My son has grown up and is to be married". Your skin is salty. I told you no to go to the beach. It's Jacko's fault. I don't want you to see him again. Hachemi! What a pleasant surprise! The door was open. Are you alone? Who do you think would be here? The neighbours? That's all over. You left everything open. I was having a little nap. I'm sorry if I woke you up. I was just passing by. You don't need any excuses. Have you forgotten that you're like a son to me? ? How are your parents? ? They're getting old. Old! What about me? But everything has aged. What ever happened to those happy evenings? The balconies full to overflowing, Arabs, Jews, French, Italians. Now, I never go out, there's no place to go. Has Jacko written? Not since Milia's death. Living in Paris makes one forget family ties. And death does the rest. And he's married, too. ? Jacko is married? ? He's even a father. Me too, I'm circumcised. And Rosa? As far-fetched as ever. She wants to go to America. To tease me, my mother used to say: "Hachemi and Rosa were made for each other". And I used to run away. It was only a joke ? a Jewess and an Arab. And you, are you married? Next Tuesday. I've come to invite you. I couldn't attend Jacko's wedding, but I'll celebrate yours. I should have sent them to Jacko. Oh well, God will forgive us. Let me show you how. To your health! What Boukha! It's been years! Did you ever drink with my father? No. Your father is a good Moslem. I remember 13 years ago. He had you by the hand and he said: "I put my son in your hands ? make a man of him". I answered: a wood worker, yes, but a man, that's up to you. You were so afraid. Fortunately, Ameur took you in hand. And Farfat? Ameur fired him 3 times. He wanted to fire you, too. I used to run away to go to school. You are Jacko's friend. How could he have fired you? ? You're not drinking. ? My head is spinning. You and Jacko are so alike. And Ameur? He's the only one who's stayed with me. He wants the work shops. That's to be expected. He's been with me for 20 years. And all that he did for you... Pour me some more. These minutes are precious. I can't seem to get it right. There we are. I came to see you and the doors were all closed. I remember the streets and even their gaiety. The neighbourhoods have lost their charm. No one sings in the courtyards and celebrates in the balconies. The doors no longer dance and the locks are all in silence. The roofs break out in tears as the swallows fly away. I came to see you and the doors were all closed. I remember the days when the streets were so gay. The neighbourhoods have lost their charm. No one sings in the courtyards or celebrates on the balconies. The doors no longer dance and the locks are all in silence. The roofs break out in tears as the swallows fly away. On the strings of my lute, I've played you this song to bring back to your face your smile of long ago. Let happiness reign and know no bounds. Let happiness reign and know no bounds. Excuse my voice, it's old age. The song is for your wedding and the lute is for you. Show me how the pupil outshines his teacher. You flatter me. I've never played for anyone before. Sometimes I feel the need of someone who would listen to me. I've never talked to my father, I wanted to talk to you. Some things are so hard to say, and so hard to keep to oneself. It happened a long time ago at the end of the day. Farfat and I stayed behind... Here, it's for you. I'll take you to the cinema on Monday. What are you doing here? Go home quickly. Why aren't you celebrating with the others? Too many people there. I don't want to see them. No one is satisfied anymore. Where did you spend the evening? I was saying good-bye to my friends. I am an enfant terrible. My flame will light up yet! You'll wake up the neighbours. Leave me alone. I want them to hear. I am an enfant terrible. Stop shouting, I beg you. I have a headache. Scatter my flesh on the doorsteps of the mosques. Rest your weary bones. Even wood gets tired. Stop your drinking and go to bed. Because you're getting married you talk like them. I didn't say good-bye to Fathi. Sleep. We'll see him tomorrow. I don't know a soul in Tunis. I wonder if my mother will miss me? At every light that shines, I jump up with a start. At every noise I hear my heart beats more quickly. I warmed up your dinner but it's cold again. Even the fire has burned down. It's him! My dear son! I feel alive again. But you smell of wine, your father will kill us. Go to your room. Go into your room. You come home at this hour, drunk? No, you're not going out. Aren't you well? What did they do to you? I have a headache, leave me alone. Everyone does their best for his. His highness is not happy. Nafissa! Nafissa! We've furnitured a new apartment for him! What else does he want? If I were you, I'd throw him out. No one asked you for your advice. Who forced him! May God take him! Nafissa! Nafissa! All you saints of the city, I implore your aid. Oh Sidi Youssef, Sidi Mhamed, come to my aid. Sidi Boulbaba, barber of the Prophet. Put out the flames that consume me! Come quickly, merciful ones! The fire is burning me. You have punished me. Let me go! Let me go! Oh you saints, deliver me! Take away my pain. Open wide my eyes so I can see my enemies! Lead us back to the right path. May God grant you happiness and deliver you from your pain. Where are you going? Dear God, protect Hachemi. We're not your puppets. Do you want to turn the celebration into a tragedy? The wedding is on Tuesday. We men have so decided. Go to bed and sleep on it. But who can sleep? May God take him. You're all against me... Even my brother, Samir the Doctor. May God take me and leave you in peace. I don't want this marriage, neither does God. Take that for treating us like playthings. Look at these workworn hands toughened by cinders. Only humiliation can turn them into ashes. Since when has a beating harmed a man? Mr. Levy is dead. Hello there, Hachemi. May he rest in peace. It's Nafissa's son. They used to live here. We want to bury... Hachemi's bachelorhood. With your woe-begone faces? Do you have a house? Or do you do it in the open air? I know one who strips naked. But you have to pay another round! Hachemi's getting drunk! Let's drink to that. That's enough, it's late. It's 8:00 P.M., closing time. Farfat, you can count on me. Are you the Salvation Army? Do you know Sejra (tree)? You'll love her, everyone does. It's over. We're closing up. Mama, open the door. You must eat. There's no light. That's strange, she's never lied before. Perhaps she's dead! She never dies when she has a rendez-vous. ? Who's there? ? It's Touil. I was sure of that. Let me introduce Hachemi. Azaiez. And Farfat. Where were you? I was just watching the programme. Who has never dreamed of a night at Sejra's? Times have changed and friends have all scattered. The walls still remember. The best of men. I did as planned. Because of your good heart. Take this. Taste it at least. I don't drink anymore. I'm thinking of holy places. Die in beauty. The other day I almost died. Mother Sejra, show Hachemi your patrimony. It was the reign of Sejra. I decided everything depending on how I felt. I refused to remove them... For all the money in the world. To hell with History! Don't you have anything a little lighter? ? You're really unique. ? Show me, I missed it. That's not for you. If you're going to make fun of me, I'm leaving. No, stay. I have a feeling this will turn sour. Don't act like a child! And if I were a child? Did you hear that? I take back what I said. Stay, for Hachemi's sake. Come on in. And you've just shaken hands. Here's my cheek. Slap it. Are you beyond a little fun? I feel so badly. Farfat, laugh a little, please. O.K. leave me alone. Mother Sejra, your girls are late. You can no longer be sure of anything. Go and get them; take a taxi. But I can't leave you alone. Invent them, I know you can do it. When I have company, I'm helpless. I'm completely confused. ? Who is it? ? We're here, open up. You are really unique. Welcome! Come on up. May God bless you, youthful beauty. ? You're late. ? It's very far. Today, your life begins. Come, let me rest my eyes on you. I'm as tough as leather. I've been dreaming for years. All my life I've had the same dream. I haven't dreamed for years. All men are born naked. Are you crazy? You'll find out. Hands off! I said hands off! That's enough, Farfat, stop. Let me go. You speak of a wedding night. Stop protecting him. Drop the cat, drop the cat. Farfat, that's enough! None of that here. Have you gone mad? They're not good enough. You're going to kill me. What a night! I thought it was a good idea, to bring old friends together. You have to separate them. I beg your pardon. There's nothing to explain. It's just stupid. You came here to wash your dirty linen? This cat has never harmed you. Relax, you've danced and drunk too much. We don't deserve such generosity. What luck to have found you. You are Sejra, the tree, and I am a sculptor of wood. We are one and... Sculpt me into a thing of beauty as I was 35 years ago. No one loves me. Hasna, come here. Let me go, we know your game. Shut up! I don't like pimps. Let me be. You are only a spectator tonight. What's your name? Amina. You spend your life protecting children... Children. Farfat, show him you're a man. Only women are defenceless. Everyone knows about him and Ameur. Take that back! You don't deserve anything else. What Class! Farfat has gone; you'd better catch him. Touil, come with me. Nothing? Check over there. What's the matter? Let me go, Hachemi. Watch out for yourself. Wait for me, Touil. Let me by. Come up. Are you crazy? Drop the knife. Ameur, let's see if you're really a man. You're afraid. The boys are big now and so is the score to be settled. Don't be crazy! Help! They haven't done anything. Close the door. I'm going to kill him tonight. You dare attack them in my absence? Calm down. Take the knife away from him. You have more sense, at least. I've come to settle things with you. You'll always be my apprentices. Farfat, Hachemi, come here. I taught you everything. He's the one that's right. I've never carried anything through. You are the cream of men. I want to stay here. I've always dreamed of a son. But not you. You have your family. Amina, go back to your room. It's for Amina. Forget her. We're used to forgetting. "Forget it" Farfat is not a man.
