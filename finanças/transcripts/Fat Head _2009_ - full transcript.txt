The story we've all heard about weight control goes like this. The story we've all heard about weight control goes like this. If you eat more calories than weight control goes like this. If you eat more calories than you burn, the extra calories if you eat more calories than you burn, the extra calories turn to fat, but if you just you burn, the extra calories turn to fat, but if you just consume fewer calories or burn turn to fat, but if you just consume fewer calories or burn more calories by exercising, consume fewer calories or burn more calories by exercising, you create a calorie deficit more calories by exercising, you create a calorie deficit and you automatically lose you create a calorie deficit and you automatically lose weight.

Using my functioning brain, I did a few minutes of research using my functioning brain, I did a few minutes of research and found that a man of my size did a few minutes of research and found that a man of my size and activity level burns about and found that a man of my size and activity level burns about 2,500 calories per day. And activity level burns about 2,500 calories per day. To create a calorie deficit, 2,500 calories per day. To create a calorie deficit, I'm setting a target of to create a calorie deficit, I'm setting a target of 2,000 calories per day. I'm setting a target of 2,000 calories per day. I'll also burn a few extra 2,000 calories per day.

To make sure my body can burn its own fat for fuel, I'm to make sure my body can burn its own fat for fuel, I'm going to keep my Insulin down its own fat for fuel, I'm going to keep my Insulin down by limiting my carbohydrates to going to keep my Insulin down by limiting my carbohydrates to about 100 per day.

She didn't make human beings the only species on earth who she didn't make human beings the only species on earth who prefers foods that will kill only species on earth who prefers foods that will kill us. Prefers foods that will kill us. So, what do human beings us. So, what do human beings naturally like to eat? >> Your natural preference is for things that are salty, for things that are salty, things that are sweet, and things that are sweet, and things that are fatty. You have those three native desires for good reason. Those are the things that are desires for good reason. Those are the things that are good for you. Those are the things that are good for you. That's where the nutrients that good for you. That's where the nutrients that you need are located. That's where the nutrients that you need are located. >> In nature, sweet means fruit, you need are located. >> In nature, sweet means fruit, along with certain vegetables >> in nature, sweet means fruit, along with certain vegetables like carrots. Along with certain vegetables like carrots. And those are good for you. Like carrots. And those are good for you. Fats occur naturally in foods and those are good for you. Fats occur naturally in foods like olives and nuts, but for fats occur naturally in foods like olives and nuts, but for most of human history, the like olives and nuts, but for most of human history, the biggest source of fat was most of human history, the biggest source of fat was saturated animal fat, which is biggest source of fat was saturated animal fat, which is fatty and salty. Saturated animal fat, which is fatty and salty. Yum, yum. Fatty and salty. Yum, yum. And for millions of years, this yum, yum. And for millions of years, this is exactly how we ate. And for millions of years, this is exactly how we ate. We ate no sugar, almost no is exactly how we ate. We ate no sugar, almost no starch, a little bit of we ate no sugar, almost no starch, a little bit of vegetable fat, and a whole lot starch, a little bit of vegetable fat, and a whole lot of saturated animal fat, up to vegetable fat, and a whole lot of saturated animal fat, up to 5 or even 10 times as much as of saturated animal fat, up to 5 or even 10 times as much as the experts say we should. 5 or even 10 times as much as the experts say we should. But almost nobody got heart the experts say we should. But almost nobody got heart disease. >> If you look at pre-agricultural humans, at pre-agricultural humans, at their skeletal remains, the their skeletal remains, the cortical thickness of their cortical thickness of their bones, they're robust, they're bones, they're robust, they're tall, they had good teeth. When societies became agricultural, and we became short of stature, you know, agricultural, and we became short of stature, you know, tooth decay became rampant, short of stature, you know, tooth decay became rampant, infections were rampant -- tooth decay became rampant, infections were rampant -- human health devolved when we infections were rampant -- human health devolved when we adopted agriculture. Human health devolved when we adopted agriculture. >> If you could pack all of adopted agriculture. >> If you could pack all of human history into one year, >> if you could pack all of human history into one year, we've only been farming and human history into one year, we've only been farming and eating grain since about we've only been farming and eating grain since about yesterday, which is when we eating grain since about yesterday, which is when we became shorter and fatter. Yesterday, which is when we became shorter and fatter. We only started consuming became shorter and fatter. We only started consuming processed vegetable oils about we only started consuming processed vegetable oils about 10 minutes ago, which is when processed vegetable oils about 10 minutes ago, which is when heart disease became our 10 minutes ago, which is when heart disease became our number-one killer. Heart disease became our number-one killer. So, after examining all this number-one killer. So, after examining all this human history, the experts came so, after examining all this human history, the experts came to the obvious conclusion -- we human history, the experts came to the obvious conclusion -- we need to eat a lot more of these. To the obvious conclusion -- we need to eat a lot more of these. And so they convinced us that need to eat a lot more of these. And so they convinced us that human health depends on foods we and so they convinced us that human health depends on foods we didn't eat for more than 99 % of human health depends on foods we didn't eat for more than 99 % of our entire existence. Didn't eat for more than 99 % of our entire existence. How did this happen? Our entire existence. How did this happen? >> She-do-do-do how did this happen? >> She-do-do-do she-do-do-do >> she-do-do-do she-do-do-do she-do-do-do, wow-wow she-do-do-do she-do-do-do, wow-wow >> in the 1950s, a biochemist she-do-do-do, wow-wow >> in the 1950s, a biochemist named ancel keys published a >> in the 1950s, a biochemist named ancel keys published a study that compared heart named ancel keys published a study that compared heart disease and fat consumption in a study that compared heart disease and fat consumption in a half-dozen countries -- disease and fat consumption in a half-dozen countries -- the more fat, the more heart half-dozen countries -- the more fat, the more heart disease. The more fat, the more heart disease. The trend line was unmistakable. Just one little problem -- keys left out countries where people eat a lot of fat but have keys left out countries where people eat a lot of fat but have very little heart disease, like people eat a lot of fat but have very little heart disease, like Holland and Norway. He also left out countries where people don't each much fat but do have a lot of heart disease, people don't each much fat but do have a lot of heart disease, like Chile. Do have a lot of heart disease, like Chile. In fact, keys had reliable data like Chile. In fact, keys had reliable data from 22 countries, and the in fact, keys had reliable data from 22 countries, and the results were all over the place, from 22 countries, and the results were all over the place, but you can't make a big splash results were all over the place, but you can't make a big splash in the scientific community with but you can't make a big splash in the scientific community with a trend line that looks like in the scientific community with a trend line that looks like this. A trend line that looks like this. So keys did what any dedicated this. So keys did what any dedicated researcher would do. So keys did what any dedicated researcher would do. He threw out the data that researcher would do. He threw out the data that didn't fit and published his he threw out the data that didn't fit and published his results. Didn't fit and published his results. His punishment for this bit of results. His punishment for this bit of scientific chicanery was to get his punishment for this bit of scientific chicanery was to get his picture on the cover of scientific chicanery was to get his picture on the cover of time magazine. His picture on the cover of time magazine. Keys became known as the father time magazine. Keys became known as the father of the lipid hypothesis, which keys became known as the father of the lipid hypothesis, which says that eating saturated fat of the lipid hypothesis, which says that eating saturated fat raises the cholesterol in your says that eating saturated fat raises the cholesterol in your blood, and high cholesterol in raises the cholesterol in your blood, and high cholesterol in your blood clogs your arteries blood, and high cholesterol in your blood clogs your arteries and causes heart disease. >> The hypothesis that when you eat high fat that then that eat high fat that then that produces high cholesterol, and produces high cholesterol, and the cholesterol produces heart the cholesterol produces heart disease, is wrong in every one disease, is wrong in every one of those links. Of those links. >> This whole idea that dietary >> this whole idea that dietary fat causes cholesterol problems fat causes cholesterol problems is sort of a myth. Is sort of a myth.

And British doctor Malcolm Kendrick. When they examined the data from Malcolm Kendrick. When they examined the data from all the big studies on heart when they examined the data from all the big studies on heart disease, they discovered some all the big studies on heart disease, they discovered some pretty interesting facts. Disease, they discovered some pretty interesting facts. Here's my favorite. Pretty interesting facts. Here's my favorite. Guess how many studies actually here's my favorite. Guess how many studies actually prove that a high-fat diet guess how many studies actually prove that a high-fat diet causes heart disease. Prove that a high-fat diet causes heart disease. The answer -- zero. Causes heart disease. The answer -- zero. That's right. None. The answer -- zero. That's right. None. In some of the largest studies that's right. None. In some of the largest studies ever conducted, researchers put in some of the largest studies ever conducted, researchers put thousands of volunteers on a ever conducted, researchers put thousands of volunteers on a low-fat diet and then tracked thousands of volunteers on a low-fat diet and then tracked their health history for several low-fat diet and then tracked their health history for several years. Their health history for several years. The results -- nothing. Years. The results -- nothing. They had just as many heart the results -- nothing. They had just as many heart attacks as people who weren't on they had just as many heart attacks as people who weren't on a low-fat diet. Attacks as people who weren't on a low-fat diet. Since 1948, the Harvard medical a low-fat diet. Since 1948, the Harvard medical school has been following the since 1948, the Harvard medical school has been following the diets and death rates of the school has been following the diets and death rates of the entire population of diets and death rates of the entire population of framingham, Massachusetts. One of the researchers involved in the framingham study called the lipid hypothesis... And after more than 40 years, even the director of the study made a rather startling even the director of the study made a rather startling admission about what the study made a rather startling admission about what the study data actually shows. In other words, a high-fat diet does not automatically raise your cholesterol. Does not automatically raise your cholesterol. Well, what about the second half your cholesterol. Well, what about the second half of the lipid hypothesis? Well, what about the second half of the lipid hypothesis? Whether it comes from your diet of the lipid hypothesis? Whether it comes from your diet or not, doesn't high cholesterol whether it comes from your diet or not, doesn't high cholesterol cause heart disease? Or not, doesn't high cholesterol cause heart disease? After all, that's what the cause heart disease? After all, that's what the experts have been telling us for after all, that's what the experts have been telling us for 50 years. Experts have been telling us for 50 years. >> Lots of people have bad heart 50 years. >> Lots of people have bad heart attacks and have low >> lots of people have bad heart attacks and have low cholesterol. Attacks and have low cholesterol. There's not really a huge cholesterol. There's not really a huge correlation there. >> You've got people who have heart attacks and who develop plaque who have high heart attacks and who develop plaque who have high cholesterol, people who have low plaque who have high cholesterol, people who have low cholesterol.

Heart disease. Cholesterol is the thing that cholesterol is the thing that heart disease acts upon. Heart disease acts upon. The heart disease is the the heart disease is the inflammation and the oxidation, inflammation and the oxidation, the plaquing out of cholesterol the plaquing out of cholesterol once it becomes oxidized. >> So many people have been found that had low, normal or low cholesterol, and they still found that had low, normal or low cholesterol, and they still had bad heart disease, but most low cholesterol, and they still had bad heart disease, but most of those people, when they're had bad heart disease, but most of those people, when they're checked carefully, will have of those people, when they're checked carefully, will have signs of inflammation. Checked carefully, will have signs of inflammation. >> To understand how signs of inflammation. >> To understand how inflammation can cause heart >> to understand how inflammation can cause heart disease, let's look at what inflammation can cause heart disease, let's look at what cholesterol actually does. Disease, let's look at what cholesterol actually does. Cholesterol is one of the most cholesterol actually does. Cholesterol is one of the most important substances in your cholesterol is one of the most important substances in your body. Important substances in your body. Without it, you would be dead. Body.

Can make its own cholesterol if it has to. The heart-disease story we all it has to. The heart-disease story we all know goes like this. The heart-disease story we all know goes like this. If you have too much ldl, or bad know goes like this. If you have too much ldl, or bad cholesterol, it builds up in if you have too much ldl, or bad cholesterol, it builds up in your arteries and makes them cholesterol, it builds up in your arteries and makes them narrow. Your arteries and makes them narrow. But if you're lucky, hdl, or narrow. But if you're lucky, hdl, or good cholesterol, gobbles it up but if you're lucky, hdl, or good cholesterol, gobbles it up and clears it away. Good cholesterol, gobbles it up and clears it away. It's a nice, simple story, and and clears it away. It's a nice, simple story, and it's a load of baloney. It's a nice, simple story, and it's a load of baloney. For one thing, ldl and hdl are it's a load of baloney. For one thing, ldl and hdl are not cholesterol. For one thing, ldl and hdl are not cholesterol. They're proteins that carry not cholesterol. They're proteins that carry cholesterol through your blood. They're proteins that carry cholesterol through your blood. Ldl carries cholesterol from cholesterol through your blood. Ldl carries cholesterol from your liver to your tissues, and ldl carries cholesterol from your liver to your tissues, and hdl carries old cholesterol back your liver to your tissues, and hdl carries old cholesterol back to your liver, where it's hdl carries old cholesterol back to your liver, where it's recycled. To your liver, where it's recycled. If you want more hdl, the last recycled. If you want more hdl, the last thing you need is a low-fat if you want more hdl, the last thing you need is a low-fat diet. Thing you need is a low-fat diet. >> What makes hdl go up? Diet. >> What makes hdl go up? Fat in the diet. >> What makes hdl go up? Fat in the diet. That's what raises hdl. Fat in the diet. That's what raises hdl. So you increase the fat in your that's what raises hdl. So you increase the fat in your diet, and your hdl, deemed by so you increase the fat in your diet, and your hdl, deemed by even the most fervent diet, and your hdl, deemed by even the most fervent anti-cholesterol person as the even the most fervent anti-cholesterol person as the good cholesterol, hdl goes up. Anti-cholesterol person as the good cholesterol, hdl goes up. >> That's right. Good cholesterol, hdl goes up. >> That's right. In spite of what the experts >> that's right. In spite of what the experts told us, 27 different studies in spite of what the experts told us, 27 different studies have shown that eating saturated told us, 27 different studies have shown that eating saturated fat raises your hdl. Have shown that eating saturated fat raises your hdl. And despite its bad reputation, fat raises your hdl. And despite its bad reputation, not all ldl is actually bad. >> Ldl comes in different size packages. There are little small, dense, packages. There are little small, dense, b.B.-Like packages, and there there are little small, dense, b.B.-Like packages, and there are big, round, fluffy, b.B.-Like packages, and there are big, round, fluffy, cotton-ball-like packages. And the small, dense ones, it turns out, what's called the type-b ldl, are the most harmful turns out, what's called the type-b ldl, are the most harmful ones, and the big, fluffy ones type-b ldl, are the most harmful ones, and the big, fluffy ones aren't particularly harmful at ones, and the big, fluffy ones aren't particularly harmful at all. Aren't particularly harmful at all. >> Heart disease doesn't begin all. >> Heart disease doesn't begin when your cholesterol goes up. >> Heart disease doesn't begin when your cholesterol goes up. It begins when your arteries when your cholesterol goes up. It begins when your arteries become damaged or inflamed. It begins when your arteries become damaged or inflamed. Ldl then does exactly what it's become damaged or inflamed. Ldl then does exactly what it's supposed to do -- it brings in ldl then does exactly what it's supposed to do -- it brings in cholesterol to help the healing supposed to do -- it brings in cholesterol to help the healing process. Cholesterol to help the healing process. But if small ldl becomes damaged process. But if small ldl becomes damaged by oxidation, it can penetrate but if small ldl becomes damaged by oxidation, it can penetrate the wall of the artery. By oxidation, it can penetrate the wall of the artery. If the inflammation and the wall of the artery. If the inflammation and oxidation continue, a plaque if the inflammation and oxidation continue, a plaque begins to form. Oxidation continue, a plaque begins to form. Now you've got heart disease. Begins to form. Now you've got heart disease. So, does a high-fat diet produce now you've got heart disease. So, does a high-fat diet produce too much small ldl? So, does a high-fat diet produce too much small ldl? Nope. Too much small ldl? Nope. Small ldl is the result of nope. Small ldl is the result of eating too many carbohydrates. Small ldl is the result of eating too many carbohydrates. >> That's been shown in eating too many carbohydrates. >> That's been shown in the medical literature probably >> that's been shown in the medical literature probably a dozen times, at least, in the medical literature probably a dozen times, at least, in papers, that reducing a dozen times, at least, in papers, that reducing carbohydrate in the diet shifts papers, that reducing carbohydrate in the diet shifts from a small, dense pattern to a carbohydrate in the diet shifts from a small, dense pattern to a big, fluffy pattern. From a small, dense pattern to a big, fluffy pattern. >> Having an ldl that's 120 or big, fluffy pattern. >> Having an ldl that's 120 or 130 or 100 or 145 doesn't matter >> having an ldl that's 120 or 130 or 100 or 145 doesn't matter as much as the kind of ldl that 130 or 100 or 145 doesn't matter as much as the kind of ldl that it is. As much as the kind of ldl that it is. >> If the numbers alone don't it is. >> If the numbers alone don't mean very much, then why does >> if the numbers alone don't mean very much, then why does high cholesterol get all the mean very much, then why does high cholesterol get all the blame? High cholesterol get all the blame? Research consistently shows that blame? Research consistently shows that smoking, elevated blood sugar, research consistently shows that smoking, elevated blood sugar, and emotional stress can cause smoking, elevated blood sugar, and emotional stress can cause inflammation, damage your and emotional stress can cause inflammation, damage your arteries, and lead to heart inflammation, damage your arteries, and lead to heart disease. Arteries, and lead to heart disease. They also happen to raise your disease. They also happen to raise your cholesterol. They also happen to raise your cholesterol. So, by blaming cholesterol for cholesterol. So, by blaming cholesterol for causing heart disease, the so, by blaming cholesterol for causing heart disease, the experts relied on logic that causing heart disease, the experts relied on logic that makes about as much sense as experts relied on logic that makes about as much sense as this. Makes about as much sense as this. In high-crime areas, there are this. In high-crime areas, there are more calls to the police. In high-crime areas, there are more calls to the police. Therefore, we can assume that more calls to the police. Therefore, we can assume that calling the police produces an therefore, we can assume that calling the police produces an increase in crime. Calling the police produces an increase in crime. To get rid of crime, the answer increase in crime. To get rid of crime, the answer is simple -- stop calling the to get rid of crime, the answer is simple -- stop calling the police. Is simple -- stop calling the police. But in spite of all the evidence police. But in spite of all the evidence that cholesterol is just an but in spite of all the evidence that cholesterol is just an innocent bystander, the experts that cholesterol is just an innocent bystander, the experts keep trying to bring it up on innocent bystander, the experts keep trying to bring it up on charges. Keep trying to bring it up on charges. In 1988, the surgeon general's charges. In 1988, the surgeon general's office set out to prove the in 1988, the surgeon general's office set out to prove the lipid hypothesis by reviewing office set out to prove the lipid hypothesis by reviewing the data from all the major lipid hypothesis by reviewing the data from all the major studies, but after 11 years and the data from all the major studies, but after 11 years and more than $100 million, the studies, but after 11 years and more than $100 million, the results were not supporting the more than $100 million, the results were not supporting the theory, so they did what any results were not supporting the theory, so they did what any dedicated government researchers theory, so they did what any dedicated government researchers would do -- they shut down the dedicated government researchers would do -- they shut down the entire project, saying it was would do -- they shut down the entire project, saying it was becoming too complicated. Entire project, saying it was becoming too complicated. And as Kendrick, taubes, and becoming too complicated. And as Kendrick, taubes, and ravnskov discovered, that's been and as Kendrick, taubes, and ravnskov discovered, that's been a disturbingly common pattern. Ravnskov discovered, that's been a disturbingly common pattern. Researchers routinely ignore a disturbingly common pattern. Researchers routinely ignore evidence that the lipid researchers routinely ignore evidence that the lipid hypothesis is wrong and evidence that the lipid hypothesis is wrong and sometimes even manipulate their hypothesis is wrong and sometimes even manipulate their data for the sole purpose of sometimes even manipulate their data for the sole purpose of supporting it. Data for the sole purpose of supporting it. What could possibly cause such supporting it. What could possibly cause such rampant dishonesty? What could possibly cause such rampant dishonesty? [Boing!] Rampant dishonesty? [Boing! ] In the 1970s, the lipid [boing!] In the 1970s, the lipid hypothesis was still very much in the 1970s, the lipid hypothesis was still very much in dispute. Hypothesis was still very much in dispute. Then a senate committee headed in dispute. Then a senate committee headed by George mcgovern decided to then a senate committee headed by George mcgovern decided to settle the issue. Mcgovern at the time was following the pritikin diet and believed everyone should be following the pritikin diet and believed everyone should be cutting back on fat and believed everyone should be cutting back on fat and cholesterol. >> The committee's original report urged Americans to reduce their risk of heart attacks by report urged Americans to reduce their risk of heart attacks by reducing their intake of their risk of heart attacks by reducing their intake of cholesterol down to the reducing their intake of cholesterol down to the equivalent of about one egg a cholesterol down to the equivalent of about one egg a day, but doctors took issue with equivalent of about one egg a day, but doctors took issue with that at the hearing, saying that day, but doctors took issue with that at the hearing, saying that eight studies, involving 5,000 that at the hearing, saying that eight studies, involving 5,000 patients, failed to show hard eight studies, involving 5,000 patients, failed to show hard medical evidence that diet has patients, failed to show hard medical evidence that diet has anything to do with heart medical evidence that diet has anything to do with heart attacks.

Servings of protein, carbohydrates, and fat. Fda commissioner David Kessler carbohydrates, and fat. Fda commissioner David Kessler said it was the most important fda commissioner David Kessler said it was the most important battle for public health he'd said it was the most important battle for public health he'd ever waged. Battle for public health he'd ever waged. Stories in the media were full ever waged. Stories in the media were full of happy predictions about how stories in the media were full of happy predictions about how much smarter Americans were of happy predictions about how much smarter Americans were going to eat thanks to all that much smarter Americans were going to eat thanks to all that good government advice. Going to eat thanks to all that good government advice. And since then... Well, maybe we're not following those guidelines, or maybe we are. Those guidelines, or maybe we are. The nutrition label the fda made are. The nutrition label the fda made everybody adopt recommends 300 the nutrition label the fda made everybody adopt recommends 300 carbohydrates per day on a everybody adopt recommends 300 carbohydrates per day on a 2,000-calorie diet. Carbohydrates per day on a 2,000-calorie diet. If you ate four cups of 2,000-calorie diet. If you ate four cups of broccoli, three cups of spinach, if you ate four cups of broccoli, three cups of spinach, two cups of peas, five carrots, broccoli, three cups of spinach, two cups of peas, five carrots, and two apples, you would two cups of peas, five carrots, and two apples, you would consume about 100 grams of and two apples, you would consume about 100 grams of carbohydrate. Consume about 100 grams of carbohydrate. So how do you get to 300? Carbohydrate.

The foods we ate for millions of the foods we ate for millions of years almost all had a low years almost all had a low glycemic index. Glycemic index. So, what about all those whole so, what about all those whole grains the experts tell us grains the experts tell us should be the foundation of a healthy human diet? Should be the foundation of a healthy human diet? Raisin bran has a glycemic index healthy human diet? Raisin bran has a glycemic index of 61. Raisin bran has a glycemic index of 61. Shredded wheat logs in at 67, of 61. Shredded wheat logs in at 67, which means it spikes your blood shredded wheat logs in at 67, which means it spikes your blood sugar faster than sugar does. Which means it spikes your blood sugar faster than sugar does. And depending on the brand, sugar faster than sugar does. And depending on the brand, whole-wheat bread raises the bar and depending on the brand, whole-wheat bread raises the bar to around 70.

Bread, that converts to a cup and a half of sugar. If you were to put a cup and a and a half of sugar. If you were to put a cup and a half of sugar directly into your if you were to put a cup and a half of sugar directly into your blood, you'd be dead.

Most of us think we only put fat in our fat cells when we eat too much, but, as Gary taubes in our fat cells when we eat too much, but, as Gary taubes explains in "good calories, bad much, but, as Gary taubes explains in "good calories, bad calories," your fat cells are calories," your fat cells are like rechargeable fuel cells. Like rechargeable fuel cells. Every time you eat, your store every time you eat, your store some fat. Some fat. In between meals, fat comes out in between meals, fat comes out of your fat cells to provide the of your fat cells to provide the fuel for your muscles and organs. Fuel for your muscles and organs. If you're naturally thin, it's organs. If you're naturally thin, it's because you have efficient fat because you have efficient fat cells. Cells. Fat goes in quickly, and it fat goes in quickly, and it comes out easily. Comes out easily. Your body doesn't need much fat your body doesn't need much fat because the little bit of fat because the little bit of fat you do have is a reliable source you do have is a reliable source of fuel. Of fuel. If you're predisposed to be fat, if you're predisposed to be fat, it's because you have greedy fat it's because you have greedy fat cells. Cells. When you eat, you tend to store when you eat, you tend to store calories as fat instead of calories as fat instead of burning them, and when your burning them, and when your other tissues need those other tissues need those calories, the fat comes out calories, the fat comes out slowly if it comes out at all. Slowly if it comes out at all. >> What are they doing? >> What are they doing? >> Did one of you guys forget to >> did one of you guys forget to pay the food bill? Pay the food bill? >> Are you going to eat all that? >> Are you going to eat all that? >> The end user of food that we >> the end user of food that we eat are our individual cells. Eat are our individual cells. It doesn't matter if it goes in it doesn't matter if it goes in our mouth. Our mouth. If it doesn't get to those cells, we starve. Cells, we starve. We starve at the cellular level. We starve at the cellular level. >> And so you do exactly what >> and so you do exactly what your body is telling you to do.

In other words, you're not getting fat because you're in other words, you're not getting fat because you're eating more, you're eating more getting fat because you're eating more, you're eating more because you're getting fat. Eating more, you're eating more because you're getting fat. Remember, mother nature isn't because you're getting fat. Remember, mother nature isn't stupid. Remember, mother nature isn't stupid. If your fat cells are slow to stupid. If your fat cells are slow to release their fuel, your body if your fat cells are slow to release their fuel, your body actually works to make them release their fuel, your body actually works to make them bigger. Actually works to make them bigger. And they keep on getting bigger bigger. And they keep on getting bigger until they can release the and they keep on getting bigger until they can release the energy that your body needs. Until they can release the energy that your body needs. That could mean gaining a little energy that your body needs. That could mean gaining a little weight, or it could mean gaining that could mean gaining a little weight, or it could mean gaining a lot. Weight, or it could mean gaining a lot. It all depends on how slowly a lot. It all depends on how slowly your fat cells release their it all depends on how slowly your fat cells release their fat. Your fat cells release their fat. Most of us weren't born with fat. Most of us weren't born with greedy fat cells, but we can most of us weren't born with greedy fat cells, but we can certainly make them that way. Greedy fat cells, but we can certainly make them that way. When you eat too many certainly make them that way. When you eat too many carbohydrates, you raise your when you eat too many carbohydrates, you raise your blood sugar. Carbohydrates, you raise your blood sugar. Since high blood sugar is toxic, blood sugar. Since high blood sugar is toxic, your body releases Insulin to since high blood sugar is toxic, your body releases Insulin to bring it down. Your body releases Insulin to bring it down. But your body can only burn a bring it down. But your body can only burn a little bit of sugar at a time. But your body can only burn a little bit of sugar at a time. So, what happens to the rest of little bit of sugar at a time. So, what happens to the rest of it? So, what happens to the rest of it? >> Your storage sites for it? >> Your storage sites for carbohydrate are limited, and >> your storage sites for carbohydrate are limited, and we've got unlimited storage carbohydrate are limited, and we've got unlimited storage places for fat. We've got unlimited storage places for fat. So the body ends up just places for fat. So the body ends up just converting the carbohydrate to so the body ends up just converting the carbohydrate to fat. Converting the carbohydrate to fat. >> And after bringing down your fat. >> And after bringing down your blood sugar, Insulin does its >> and after bringing down your blood sugar, Insulin does its other job. Blood sugar, Insulin does its other job. It tells your body to store fat. Other job. It tells your body to store fat. >> Insulin stimulates an enzyme it tells your body to store fat. >> Insulin stimulates an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase that >> Insulin stimulates an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase that sends fat into the fat cells. Called lipoprotein lipase that sends fat into the fat cells. So if Insulin is elevated, this sends fat into the fat cells. So if Insulin is elevated, this lipoprotein lipase is really so if Insulin is elevated, this lipoprotein lipase is really activated, and it's sending fat lipoprotein lipase is really activated, and it's sending fat like crazy into the fat cells. Activated, and it's sending fat like crazy into the fat cells. So if you eat a lot of like crazy into the fat cells. So if you eat a lot of carbohydrates, your Insulin goes so if you eat a lot of carbohydrates, your Insulin goes up, you're storing fat in the carbohydrates, your Insulin goes up, you're storing fat in the fat cell. Up, you're storing fat in the fat cell. >> When you have a healthy fat cell. >> When you have a healthy metabolism, it only takes a >> when you have a healthy metabolism, it only takes a little bit of Insulin to bring metabolism, it only takes a little bit of Insulin to bring your blood sugar down, and then little bit of Insulin to bring your blood sugar down, and then everything goes back to normal. Your blood sugar down, and then everything goes back to normal. But over time, that can change. Everything goes back to normal. But over time, that can change. >> The cells can become but over time, that can change. >> The cells can become resistant to the effects of >> the cells can become resistant to the effects of Insulin. Resistant to the effects of Insulin. In essence, when that happens, Insulin. In essence, when that happens, Insulin is talking, but the in essence, when that happens, Insulin is talking, but the cells just aren't listening. Insulin is talking, but the cells just aren't listening. And so they don't get the cells just aren't listening. And so they don't get the message from Insulin, so they and so they don't get the message from Insulin, so they don't do what they're supposed message from Insulin, so they don't do what they're supposed to do.

It starts producing more has to do. It starts producing more Insulin. It starts producing more Insulin. >> You finally reach the point Insulin. >> You finally reach the point to where your Insulin is high >> you finally reach the point to where your Insulin is high just to keep your sugar normal, to where your Insulin is high just to keep your sugar normal, even if you're not eating any just to keep your sugar normal, even if you're not eating any sugar. Even if you're not eating any sugar. And then, when that happens, sugar. And then, when that happens, then it's starting to drive and then, when that happens, then it's starting to drive stuff into the fat cells. Then it's starting to drive stuff into the fat cells. And then you've reach this point stuff into the fat cells. And then you've reach this point where, all of a sudden -- bam -- and then you've reach this point where, all of a sudden -- bam -- you get fat.

Calories you always did, because now you have greedy fat cells. So you do what the experts have now you have greedy fat cells. So you do what the experts have always told us to do. So you do what the experts have always told us to do. You go on a low-fat, low-calorie always told us to do. You go on a low-fat, low-calorie diet so you can burn your own you go on a low-fat, low-calorie diet so you can burn your own body fat for fuel. Diet so you can burn your own body fat for fuel. Just one little problem -- body fat for fuel. Just one little problem -- if too many carbohydrates are just one little problem -- if too many carbohydrates are keeping your Insulin high, the if too many carbohydrates are keeping your Insulin high, the Insulin is telling your body to keeping your Insulin high, the Insulin is telling your body to store the fat instead of burning Insulin is telling your body to store the fat instead of burning it. Store the fat instead of burning it. Now you're really starving it. Now you're really starving inside. Now you're really starving inside. >> ...All that for yourself for?

It slows down your metabolism. You stop losing weight. You get tired, and then you do you stop losing weight. You get tired, and then you do things like drive around the you get tired, and then you do things like drive around the parking lot, looking for a close things like drive around the parking lot, looking for a close parking space. >> So, you know, so many of my patients come in following that advice, where they say, "well, I patients come in following that advice, where they say, "well, I know it can't be about my diet, advice, where they say, "well, I know it can't be about my diet, because I'm eating a good diet."

Lipid hypothesis might be a load of baloney. So, with a little encouragement of baloney. So, with a little encouragement from Dr. Eades, I decided to so, with a little encouragement from Dr. Eades, I decided to conduct a one-man experiment.

For a solid month, I cut all the sugar and starch out of my diet, for a solid month, I cut all the sugar and starch out of my diet, and I went on a saturated-fat sugar and starch out of my diet, and I went on a saturated-fat pig-out.

I also ate plenty of fruit covered with heavy cream and I also ate plenty of fruit covered with heavy cream and lots of green vegetables covered with heavy cream and lots of green vegetables practically swimming in butter. Lots of green vegetables practically swimming in butter. During that same month, I had a practically swimming in butter. During that same month, I had a big programming project with a during that same month, I had a big programming project with a tight deadline, so I spent a lot big programming project with a tight deadline, so I spent a lot of nights working until 2:00 in tight deadline, so I spent a lot of nights working until 2:00 in the morning. But I never felt exhausted. In fact, my energy and my mood were great. At the end of that month, I had yet another cholesterol test. Yet another cholesterol test. The results? The results? Well, let's just say somebody well, let's just say somebody has some explaining to do. Has some explaining to do. My overall cholesterol dropped, my overall cholesterol dropped, and my hdl shot up.

That was three years ago, so let's do some catching up. By the time I finished making let's do some catching up. By the time I finished making this documentary, I was by the time I finished making this documentary, I was fascinated with nutrition and this documentary, I was fascinated with nutrition and health, so I kept on fascinated with nutrition and health, so I kept on researching. Health, so I kept on researching. I've read dozens of books and researching. I've read dozens of books and hundreds of studies, and I've I've read dozens of books and hundreds of studies, and I've interviewed quite a few more hundreds of studies, and I've interviewed quite a few more doctors and researchers who say interviewed quite a few more doctors and researchers who say the low-fat, high-carbohydrate doctors and researchers who say the low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet recommended by the usda is the low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet recommended by the usda is a load of baloney. Diet recommended by the usda is a load of baloney. Yes, a lot of the so-called a load of baloney. Yes, a lot of the so-called experts still believe in the yes, a lot of the so-called experts still believe in the lipid hypothesis, but every experts still believe in the lipid hypothesis, but every year, there's more and more lipid hypothesis, but every year, there's more and more evidence that they're wrong. Year, there's more and more evidence that they're wrong. Here's what one group of evidence that they're wrong. Here's what one group of researchers had to say after here's what one group of researchers had to say after going back and examining all the researchers had to say after going back and examining all the relevant studies. There's no significant evidence for concluding that dietary saturated fat is associated with for concluding that dietary saturated fat is associated with an increased risk of coronary saturated fat is associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease or cardiovascular an increased risk of coronary heart disease or cardiovascular disease. Meanwhile, there have been several clinical studies comparing diets that are low in several clinical studies comparing diets that are low in carbohydrates versus diets that comparing diets that are low in carbohydrates versus diets that are low in both calories and carbohydrates versus diets that are low in both calories and fat. Are low in both calories and fat. And guess what. Fat. And guess what. The low-carbohydrate diets keep and guess what. The low-carbohydrate diets keep coming out on top. People not only lose more weight without counting calories, they also improve their risk factors without counting calories, they also improve their risk factors for heart disease and metabolic also improve their risk factors for heart disease and metabolic syndrome more than people who go for heart disease and metabolic syndrome more than people who go on low-fat diets. Syndrome more than people who go on low-fat diets. As a result, more doctors and on low-fat diets. As a result, more doctors and scientists are coming around to as a result, more doctors and scientists are coming around to the same conclusion -- dietary scientists are coming around to the same conclusion -- dietary fat was never the problem. The same conclusion -- dietary fat was never the problem. The problem is too many refined fat was never the problem. The problem is too many refined carbohydrates. The problem is too many refined carbohydrates. And that message is finally carbohydrates. And that message is finally starting to show up in the and that message is finally starting to show up in the mainstream media. So, am I still on a low-carb diet? Yes, but with some important diet? Yes, but with some important changes. Yes, but with some important changes. When I was shooting "fat head," changes. When I was shooting "fat head," my main focus was on limiting my when I was shooting "fat head," my main focus was on limiting my carbohydrates to around 100 my main focus was on limiting my carbohydrates to around 100 grams per day. Carbohydrates to around 100 grams per day. So if I could eat a hamburger grams per day. So if I could eat a hamburger bun or some fried-chicken strips so if I could eat a hamburger bun or some fried-chicken strips without going over the limit, bun or some fried-chicken strips without going over the limit, that was okay with me. Without going over the limit, that was okay with me. And for some time after that was okay with me. And for some time after finishing "fat head," I and for some time after finishing "fat head," I continued eating what I now call finishing "fat head," I continued eating what I now call low-carb junk foods -- continued eating what I now call low-carb junk foods -- low-carb bread, low-carb low-carb junk foods -- low-carb bread, low-carb ice cream, low-carb pasta, low-carb bread, low-carb ice cream, low-carb pasta, low-carb dessert bars, and ice cream, low-carb pasta, low-carb dessert bars, and so on. Low-carb dessert bars, and so on. Well, not anymore. So on. Well, not anymore. In the past couple of years, well, not anymore. In the past couple of years, I've become aware of researchers in the past couple of years, I've become aware of researchers and authors who promote what I've become aware of researchers and authors who promote what they call a primal diet, or a and authors who promote what they call a primal diet, or a paleo diet. They call a primal diet, or a paleo diet. The idea behind these diets is paleo diet. The idea behind these diets is based on evolutionary biology. The idea behind these diets is based on evolutionary biology. And in a nutshell, it goes like based on evolutionary biology. And in a nutshell, it goes like this. And in a nutshell, it goes like this. Yes, you may talk on a cellphone this. Yes, you may talk on a cellphone and surf the Internet, but, yes, you may talk on a cellphone and surf the Internet, but, genetically, you're almost and surf the Internet, but, genetically, you're almost exactly the same as your caveman genetically, you're almost exactly the same as your caveman ancestors. Exactly the same as your caveman ancestors. When you eat modern processed ancestors. When you eat modern processed foods that your ancestors never when you eat modern processed foods that your ancestors never would have eaten, there's a good foods that your ancestors never would have eaten, there's a good chance those foods will make you would have eaten, there's a good chance those foods will make you sick, because, genetically, chance those foods will make you sick, because, genetically, we're just not adapted to eating sick, because, genetically, we're just not adapted to eating them. We're just not adapted to eating them. And besides sugar, one of the them. And besides sugar, one of the most modern and most damaging and besides sugar, one of the most modern and most damaging foods we consume today is wheat. >> What we have today called wheat is not what we think of -- that is, this 4 1/2-, wheat is not what we think of -- that is, this 4 1/2-, 5-foot-tall plant that stands up that is, this 4 1/2-, 5-foot-tall plant that stands up to your shoulders on a grown 5-foot-tall plant that stands up to your shoulders on a grown adult. To your shoulders on a grown adult. It is a 2-foot-tall, short, adult. It is a 2-foot-tall, short, stocky plant that has a very it is a 2-foot-tall, short, stocky plant that has a very large seedhead, a very thick stocky plant that has a very large seedhead, a very thick stalk, but yields about tenfold large seedhead, a very thick stalk, but yields about tenfold more per acre. Stalk, but yields about tenfold more per acre. So, this was introduced in the more per acre. So, this was introduced in the '70s. So, this was introduced in the '70s. It caught on gradually. '70s. It caught on gradually. Many farmers, by the way, it caught on gradually. Many farmers, by the way, thought this thing looked weird many farmers, by the way, thought this thing looked weird and didn't want to grow it in thought this thing looked weird and didn't want to grow it in the late '70s. But once they saw the incredible increase in yield, they rapidly embraced it in the early '80s, increase in yield, they rapidly embraced it in the early '80s, such that, by 1985, when you embraced it in the early '80s, such that, by 1985, when you went to the grocery store and such that, by 1985, when you went to the grocery store and bought bread, cookies, cakes, went to the grocery store and bought bread, cookies, cakes, pretzels, crackers -- anything bought bread, cookies, cakes, pretzels, crackers -- anything made of wheat -- virtually all pretzels, crackers -- anything made of wheat -- virtually all of it came from this high-yield, made of wheat -- virtually all of it came from this high-yield, semi-dwarf strain. >> Okay, so today's wheat isn't the same as your grandmother's wheat. The same as your grandmother's wheat. So what? >> You cannot change a plant to this incredible degree, often using bizarre and extreme this incredible degree, often using bizarre and extreme techniques, without changing its using bizarre and extreme techniques, without changing its underlying genetics and techniques, without changing its underlying genetics and biochemistry. Underlying genetics and biochemistry. We know that multiple proteins biochemistry. We know that multiple proteins in wheat -- the gliadin we know that multiple proteins in wheat -- the gliadin proteins, the gluten proteins, in wheat -- the gliadin proteins, the gluten proteins, the lectin proteins, probably proteins, the gluten proteins, the lectin proteins, probably the glutenin proteins -- there the lectin proteins, probably the glutenin proteins -- there are a whole long list of new the glutenin proteins -- there are a whole long list of new proteins that are just are a whole long list of new proteins that are just different, perhaps by a few proteins that are just different, perhaps by a few amino acids, but as any different, perhaps by a few amino acids, but as any allergist will tell you, it just amino acids, but as any allergist will tell you, it just takes a shift of a couple, allergist will tell you, it just takes a shift of a couple, three, a handful of amino acids takes a shift of a couple, three, a handful of amino acids in a protein, and it can make a three, a handful of amino acids in a protein, and it can make a difference between no reaction in a protein, and it can make a difference between no reaction and a fatal reaction. Difference between no reaction and a fatal reaction. So we know that there have been and a fatal reaction. So we know that there have been extensive changes introduced so we know that there have been extensive changes introduced into the wheat plant. Extensive changes introduced into the wheat plant. Now we're seeing the downstream into the wheat plant. Now we're seeing the downstream consequence. Now we're seeing the downstream consequence. We're seeing this incredible consequence. We're seeing this incredible surge in diseases. We're seeing this incredible surge in diseases. I wouldn't have even thought to surge in diseases. I wouldn't have even thought to put two and two together until I wouldn't have even thought to put two and two together until we saw what happened when we put two and two together until we saw what happened when we took wheat out of the diet. >> When I stopped eating wheat and other grains, I waved and other grains, I waved goodbye to several annoying goodbye to several annoying health problems. So I'm still on a low-carb diet, but it's a diet based on unprocessed, whole foods -- but it's a diet based on unprocessed, whole foods -- meats, eggs, seafood, fruits, unprocessed, whole foods -- meats, eggs, seafood, fruits, vegetables, and nuts, with a meats, eggs, seafood, fruits, vegetables, and nuts, with a little bit of full-fat dairy.

Both of my daughters live on diets that are high in fat and both of my daughters live on diets that are high in fat and relatively low in carbohydrates. Diets that are high in fat and relatively low in carbohydrates. Of course, that means we're relatively low in carbohydrates. Of course, that means we're feeding them almost exactly the of course, that means we're feeding them almost exactly the opposite of the diet recommended feeding them almost exactly the opposite of the diet recommended by the usda. Opposite of the diet recommended by the usda. The result? By the usda. The result? Both of my girls are lean and the result?

Saturated fat -- meats, eggs, butter, and so forth. After changing their diets, they butter, and so forth. After changing their diets, they ended up losing a lot of weight after changing their diets, they ended up losing a lot of weight and drastically improving their ended up losing a lot of weight and drastically improving their health. And drastically improving their health. To be perfectly honest, making a health.
