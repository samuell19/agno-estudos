Testing, one, two, three. Roy Cohn, September 28. I was writing a profile of Roy Cohn. My recorder is going, and... I'm taking notes as well, and I said... What makes Roy Cohn tick? A love of a good fight. Uh... A certain pleasure I derive in fighting against power and the establishment. ! will take on a cause against practically anybody. I hate hypocrisy. Roy Cohn was called the most brilliant and influential lawyer in America. His specialty was power. And from the very beginning, he was flamboyant, he was ruthless and always controversial. And he was like a caged animal. If you opened the door to the cage, he would come out and get you. Roy Coho's contempt for people, his contempt for the law, was so evident on his face that if you were in his presence, you knew you were in the presence of evil. And he saw himself as a political puppeteer. He could pull strings and bring people together. He could pull strings and make people do things. Roy Cohn is the common thread from Senator Joe McCarthy... all the way to his protege, Donald Trump. When you look at Coho's life, you're shining a light... on demagoguery... hypocrisy... and the darkest parts of the American psyche. The Roy Cohn show, which is unbelievable. Now here's Roy Cohn, who appeared recently on the cover of Esquire magazine. And the title of that article, as I recall, sir, was "The Legal Executioner." - Yeah. - It went on to say that you are really a tough man - and that at times you can... - Tough, mean, vicious, so on. What does that kind of publicity do for your business in New York? Oh, it's fantastic. The worse the adjectives, the better it is for business. What are they looking for? What are they buying? Scare value. Going back, over a period of years, when I call somebody or write a letter or something like that, this is supposed to make them tremble and think, unless they act promptly and reasonably, that all sorts of terrible consequences are gonna flow. Roy's reputation in the courtroom was for such viciousness that merely retaining him usually caused the other side in any dispute to want to settle immediately. I hired Roy Cohn because he is a tough son of a bitch. If I can compare this with a Western, it's like bringing in a hired gun. That's right. My name is Roy Cohn. The way Roy Cohn practiced as an attorney was: "I don't care what the law is. I wanna know who the judge is." That's the way he worked, because that's how he manipulated the system. I would do anything to get my client to win. Yes, I would. That's my job. There isn't anything I would not do, because I believe there's only one answer in an adversary profession like law, and that is winning. And he did it in ways that were, you know, beyond Machiavellian. He was an amazing manipulator, and often got his way as a result. What are they confiscating? - Packets of white powder. - But what was it? Was it cocaine? It was not in his briefcase. They do not allege it was in his briefcase. I've read the complaint, and I was in court, and you weren't. Roy was somebody that had no boundaries. And if you were on the right side of him, it was great, and if you were on the wrong side of him, it was terrible. He loved power. He loved pulling the levers of power. And he got a taste for that very early in his career. Here's a man that everybody is going to enjoy meeting. He's Roy M. Cohn, who is confidential assistant to the United States Attorney General, and, of course, they've been very busy prosecuting the Communists and Communist Party. - Hi, Roy. - How are you, Jack? What can you tell us, Roy, that we might not know from general newspaper coverage of the workings of the party in this country? What can we watch for as individual citizens? Well, the Communists, the one thing we have to understand at the outset is that the Communist Party... IS not a political party. It is a way of life. An evil and malignant way of life. It reveals a condition akin to disease, that spreads like an epidemic, and like an epidemic, a quarantine is necessary to keep it from infecting this nation. It's a criminal conspiracy. Its object is the overthrow of the government of the United States by force and violence... and institute the worst type dictatorship this world has ever known. This was the height of the Cold War. People were genuinely terrified of a nuclear attack and of the so-called Communist menace. President Truman's dramatic announcement that Russia has created an atomic explosion sends reporters racing for the United Nations. Got any statement about President Truman's statement on the atomic bomb? - Please, please, excuse me. - Does Russia have the atomic bomb, sir? - Won't you reply to me? - What can we do? It was a period of hysteria. You really start to see the paranoid style of politics unfold. And Roy Cohn was right there. One of the greatest peacetime spy dramas in the nation's history reaches its climax as Julius Rosenberg and Mrs. Ethel Rosenberg, convicted of revealing atomic secrets to the Russians, enter the federal building in New York to hear their doom. He became one of the prosecutors in the trial of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. The appointment of Jewish prosecutors and a Jewish judge was to create the impression that it was not an anti-Semitic prosecution. He was only 23 years old, but Roy Cohn was ruthless. Roy Cohn knew how to bully, and he was willing to do whatever he could to manipulate the result. Cohn felt he could ride the wave of anti-Communism to further his own career. And, in fact, his role in that case IS subject to very serious ethical questions. According to Cohn, Judge Kaufman would call him from a phone booth outside Park Avenue Synagogue, where he urged Kaufman to impose the death penalty. It was a pathway to power for Kaufman, the judge, and for Roy Cohn. They seized the moment. They pushed it as far as they could, and it went there. Judge Irving Kaufman sentenced both Rosenbergs to death in the electric chair. It is the first time in peacetime that such a death penalty has been handed down. The country was polarized over the verdict. People took to the streets to protest, seeking clemency, which was not granted. The government never had enough evidence to convict Ethel, and yet they convicted her, sentenced her to death and killed her in the electric chair. And it was a deal that Roy Cohn helped engineer. - She just kept her hands open like this. - Right. I think, if these people are made to understand that like any other criminals, when they violate our laws, they will be punished, that that will have a strong deterrent effect. And I think that the death sentence imposed by Judge Irving R. Kaufman in the atom spy trial had a very strong deterrent effect. I think it's been a very good year on the anti-Communist front in this country. My father took me to the corner of our block to see the funeral procession go by. I'm not sure where he really stood on the Rosenberg case. But he wanted me to see this. This was a part of history. And it had an indelible effect on me... and on all of America. Cohn makes his career on the backs of the Rosenbergs, showing that he's not just a smart, young punk, but that he's a go-for-the-jugular district attorney who can quite literally strap people into the electric chair. Our guest on Meet the Press, ladies and gentlemen, is Roy M. Cohn. I'd like to put you on the receiving end of some questions you usually ask witnesses. All right. When and where were you born? I was born in New York City in 1927. Roy came from an unconventional family. His mother, Dora, was a privileged member of Jewish society. When Roy was born, the family consisted of the Bank of United States, which was a big name at the time, Van Heusen Corporation, Lionel Trains, and my own grandfather, who had started Q-tips. The truth is, Dora was not a very attractive woman. Dora, according to my mother, was the ugliest girl in the Bronx. Not only was she not attractive physically, but she had a difficult personality. Nobody would marry Dora. So they cut a deal with a young lawyer named Al Cohn. If he married Dora, they would make him a judge. They had one child, and that child was Roy. Al and Dora Cohn had a very frosty relationship. They both focused on Roy a lot, Dora even more than Al. She was the ultimate doting mother. He was treated like a young prince. Like any mother, she wanted a son who was perfect, and she had a son that was short and unattractive. And she tried to correct his nose. And she wanted a different son from the son that God gave her. That imbued him a sense of shame about who he was, and his father gave him the language whereby he would express his shame in various ways, through law and politics. And Dora and Al together were a perfect storm. His father was a very active Democrat in the Bronx and would have a lot of powerful Democrats come to dinner. And when Roy was 9, 10, 11 years old, his father would insist that Roy sit at the table with adults. And Roy would partake in conversation. When Cohn was 10, his father brought him to meet President Roosevelt. Roy dared to opine to the president, who I'm sure loved hearing it even from a 10-year-old, "I support what you're doing, packing the Supreme Court." He made his first bribe when he was about 15 years old. He got a teacher out of a traffic ticket when he was in high school. Roy Cohn knew how the system worked, and he manipulated that system for the rest of his life. You describe yourself, and it rings true, as a non-conformist. Right. I am myself an oddball in a lot of ways. I don't like conventional things or conventional standards or conventional people or conventional boredom or anything along those lines. In fact, I, very early in life, broke with tradition, and left my Jewish upper-class-orientated life in New York, and became a contradiction of everything I was supposed to stand for. Roy was the definition of a self-hating Jew. He wanted to show to the world that he wasn't Jewish. Many things he did over the years were aimed at proving that to people. - When were you admitted to the bar? - I was admitted to the bar in 1948. - When... - Five years ago. - Five years ago. 21 years old. - Yes, sir. He graduated from Columbia Law School at 20. He was so young that he wasn't able to be admitted to the bar for another year, until he was 21. He was incredibly, incredibly smart, and he was an expert at taking advantage of every connection he had. I was in the Department of Justice for a period of five years, and I worked, during that period of time, very intensively with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He attracted great attention with J. Edgar Hoover at the FBI. Hoover understood the value of planting certain information with the press. Cohn served his master, passed on the information, and Hoover returned the compliment in recommending Cohn as chief counsel to Joseph McCarthy's notorious committee. Even if there were only one Communist in the State Department, that would still be one Communist too many. McCarthy almost single-handedly made the era one in which debate became charge and countercharge. Cohn soared to national prominence as McCarthy's handmaiden, whispering in his ear in a conspiratorial fashion, advising him how to question witnesses before the congressional subcommittee. Roy's tactics and his approach via McCarthy make him one of the most controversial people in the country. I don't think you understood the question. The question was, "Do you know this man?" Can you look at the picture and tell us? I assume the answer's yes or no. Well, the assumption is a little bit mistaken in this instance. Tell us whether you know the man before you proceed. - Do you know this man, or don't you? - Your statements about him have made it difficult for me and unsafe for me. And, of course, McCarthy, we think of him in terms of investigating Communists. But he and Cohn also investigated homosexuals. In the '40s and the '50s, being gay was such a terrible secret. And that was true for Roy. It's just hard for people today to imagine the damage keeping that secret did to people and their lives. And Roy certainly would have done everything to hide it in any way. In a kind of "he doth protest too much" manner, we have Cohn investigating these homosexuals very aggressively. So he's all over the press. Roy Cohn starts getting a political and a social profile. Cohn befriended many socially connected young men. Among them... G. David Schine, a wealthy hotel heir. Cohn was able to get Schine on McCarthy's committee. It's clear to me that Roy had an interest in this beautiful David Schine that might have been not entirely about his mental capacity. Roy and David Schine went on a buddy trip together across Europe, inspecting various facilities, their libraries, attempting to ferret out any signs of Communist infiltration. We are here to gather information, to double-check leads we have and to see a vast number of individuals as long as they can contribute pertinent information or facts. I... We believe that the free world is gonna win the Cold War and win this fight by one thing: the truth. Communists are dedicated to the overthrow of the United States, who are dedicated to wiping the United States off the face of the Earth and substituting the freedom we have in America for the spiritual and mental enslavement you have in the Soviet Union. Roy Cohn has spent most of his life studying law. And finally, in his mid-20s, he has the kind of romantic crush or compulsion that most people have for the first time in high school. But Roy Cohn happens to have it when he's chief counsel for the McCarthy committee. Joseph McCarthy himself said that he never saw Roy Cohn irrational about anything except G. David Schine. Roy liked to do favors for friends, even when it was inappropriate. So when his friend David Schine was drafted into the Army, Roy tried to get him special treatment. And he pulled all the strings he could pull. He was a string-puller. This is the way things worked in the Bronx, in Manhattan politics. It's not the way things worked in the Army, and the Army was not gonna have any part of it. And that prompted the Army-McCarthy hearings. Early in 1954, Senator McCarthy said there were Communists in the United States Army and that they were being protected. The Army replied that his charges were a form of pressure to get special favors, including a direct commission for G. David Schine, a very special Army private and former McCarthy assistant. The Army-McCarthy hearings pit the United States Army against Joe McCarthy and Roy Cohn. Coho's willing to do anything in order to get more quality time with G. David Schine. That's what the Army-McCarthy hearings were about. It was televised, and 20 million stunned Americans looked on for 36 days at the greatest political spectacle of our history. A new variable had entered our political life: television. Thank you very much, Mr. Welch, and thank you, Mr. Jenkins. - You're welcome. - Mr. Cohn... I think you are conducting a little one-sided interview here, and that's perfectly all right with me, sir. I'll tell you what I have to say on the... On the witness stand, under oath. All right, thank you. That was Roy Cohn and his opinion of the interview. You can read the Army-McCarthy hearings as the original reality TV moment, because you have what is an open-ended drama with a cast of repeating characters, but you really don't know what's going to happen. Committee will please come to order. I understand the secretary of the Army is here as first witness. Roy thinks that Dave ought to be a general and operate from a penthouse on the Waldorf Astoria, or words to that effect. I asked him what would happen if Schine got overseas duty. - You were breaking the news gently, Mr. Adams? - Yes, sir. That is right. I think I observe on Colonel Bradley's face a faint little look of pleasure. - Do you, sir? - I would say that Colonel... I... You and David Schine have been what we might call warm personal friends, have you not? - He is one of my many good friends, sir, yes. - One of your many good friends. And in all fairness, Mr. Cohn, isn't it a fact that he is one of your best friends? We all have our best friends. There's no criticism of you on that account. - No, of course not, sir. - We have friends whom we love. I do. There were a lot of snide, homophobic comments that were leveled at both Cohn and Schine and at McCarthy. Did you think this came from a pixie? Will counsel, for my benefit, define... I think he might be an expert on that, - what a pixie is? - Yeah. Yes. I should say... I should say, Mr. Senator, that a pixie is a close relative of a fairy. With the word "fairy," the subtext of the Army-McCarthy hearings is spoken out loud. But it isn't true that you'd lose your head now when Dave Schine's name - is mentioned and... - That is... That is completely untrue, sir. McCarthy launched a counterattack by bringing out the fact that one of Welch's associates had been a member of an alleged Communist organization. Senator, may we not drop this? Let us not assassinate this lad further, Senator. - Let's... - You've done enough. Cohn knows that this is the moment that Joseph Welch is seizing to finally give the blast at McCarthy that everybody has been waiting for. And he starts squirming in his chair. He sort of tries to gesture to McCarthy to stop it. - Let's... - You've done enough. Have you no sense of decency, sir? At long last, have you left no sense of decency? That caught the conscience of the country and ended with McCarthy being discredited. Indeed, they were both discredited as a result of Joseph Welch's "Have you no sense of decency?" The chair declares these hearings adjourned sine die. McCarthyism. I'm not referring to the senator from Wisconsin. He's only important in that his name has taken on a dictionary meaning in the world. That meaning is the corruption of truth, the abandonment of our historical devotion to fair play. It is the abandonment of due process of law. It is the use of a big lie and the unfounded accusation against any citizen in the name of Americanism and security. It is the rise to power of the demagogue who lives on untruth. It is the spread of fear and the destruction of faith in every level of our society. What a demagogue does is throw out information that they know is salacious, attention-grabbing and headline-grabbing. And Roy proved that in the McCarthy period. Roy Cohn knew how to take a bad situation and absolutely make the most of it. No matter what happens, no matter how defeated you are, no matter how deeply you wind up in the muck, claim victory. I can't help but feel that Roy Cohn has won a really great victory. His persona as this slick, maybe a little oily, but really razor-sharp lawyer has been carved in stone. And that's what he's going to be for the rest of his career. No more shuttling between New York and Washington for Roy Cohn. The young lawyer, who befriended Private David Schine, has handed in his resignation as chief counsel to the Senate Permanent Investigation Subcommittee headed by McCarthy. The reason? He insisted that all members of the group want him to stay on, and this was not so. As for the future, Cohn says that he will wage a personal fight against Communism wherever he finds it. New York in the 1950s was a cutthroat place to make money. Mafia families operated pretty much as they wanted. Cops were on the take left and right. It was unbelievably corrupt at every level, right up to the very top in business. For Roy Cohn, this was Candy Land. I think he was trying to claw his way to the very top echelon of American society, one way or the other. Part of New York society, at that time... was preoccupied with getting the right table, going to the right place, being invited to the right function. The Stork Club, 21, Danny's Hide-A-Way. Roy always surrounded himself with womanizers and the gorgeous women who came with them. But Roy acted as though they weren't there. They were really decorations. He became an attorney in private practice. His partner was Thomas Bolan, who had close ties with the archdiocese of New York. Cohn had close ties with Cardinal Spellman. Of course, the position of the Church at that time, as it is now, was staunchly anti-Communist. They needed somebody to bring business into the firm, and that was Roy Cohn. He took his cutthroat D.C. tactics and started applying them in corporate America, at the expense of everyone in his path. And he couldn't come back from Joe McCarthy, so he just embraced it more. What you are about to see is top secret. The first official test of the powerful new Lionel Turbo Missile Firing Car. In the 1950s, Roy had his eye on a family business. His great-uncle was a Lionel, and he had founded Lionel Trains. It was a thriving company. Remember, boy, you're the boss of the greatest action cars ever created when you own Lionel trains. Roy, over the course of several months, acquired about 200,000 shares of stock, and boom, he took over the company. It took not more than a few years until he drove it into the ground. He was so full of himself, and he did not care about the family. But he was known to people as the person who was in charge of the big company. For a period of years, the first years I was with him, we were a powerful law firm. Roy was very aggressive, very smart. A very capable lawyer. He prepared at the last minute, but he had a perfect memory. We'd get in the limousine going down to court, and he'd say, "Now, tell me again, who's the client?" And he'd get up there like he'd been immersed in the case for years. He was just that good at what he did. But the big picture was more complicated. He just didn't play by the rule book, and you learned that very quickly. With time, Roy became more and more powerful, and more and more ruthless. He subjected everybody around him to potential criminal liability. For example, I was, I think, 25 years old. I had about $35 in the bank. And I was made the director of a bank in Chicago, as were some of our associates for other banks. I remember the first auditor's report, basically saying, "What happened to the money? Where's all the money?" There was always something of that criminal nature going on. - Let me talk to you about your boat. - Sure. - Okay. The boat sunk off Florida. - Okay, it was not my boat. It was owned by a corporation. And it was leased part-time by the firm. A crew member's killed on a boat that many considered yours. So it was not my boat. When I was a kid, I would go with my grandmother, because Roy would have her birthday party on his yacht, which was docked in the Hamptons. It was called Defiance. One year, there was this mysterious fire on Defiance... which happened to be insured for a lot of money. One of the crew members was killed in that fire. There were serious questions about whether Roy had a hand in burning the boat in order to get the insurance. Was it arson? Was Roy connected? The name of the crew member was Charles Martensen, he was 21, and his father, who I've talked to... Um... In effect... Not in effect, just out and out thinks you murdered his son. - He thinks I murdered his son? - To get the insurance on the boat. Well, of course, let's look at it this way. A, I didn't own the boat. B, I didn't get the insurance. C, the statement is an outrageous falsehood. Four, how am I gonna get angry at a man who lost his son? Uh... Couldn't be sorrier for him and for what happened. Like a lot of things with Roy, those questions haunted that case and that... The mystery of what happened to the young man and that boat. It just got to a point where they were crazier and crazier and crazier, culminating in his first indictment. It was a 10-count indictment, charging me with perjury, obstruction of justice and with a conspiracy to commit perjury and to obstruct justice. It was about a 48-page-long indictment. Everything bad that happened to Roy during my years at his firm was attributed to Robert Morgenthau, who was then the U.S. attorney. Cohn viewed all the three Morgenthau indictments as a vendetta. And it was a very public dispute. If there's a defendant around who hasn't been propositioned by Mr. Morgenthau's office to furnish some kind of information on me in return for a deal, I haven't met him. He's the only person I've ever met who actually enjoyed being indicted, because it gave him a platform to attack. A federal grand jury in New York today indicted Roy Cohn on charges of fraud and conspiracy. Cohn could be sentenced to 38 years in jail and fined $55,000 if convicted on all counts. I can't imagine the kind of pressure he was under while this was going on, but he never showed it. There was a confidence about him that was unshakable. He managed to get out of legal difficulties in ways that almost no other lawyer could have. He was a legal magician. If Mr. Morgenthau were being honest, he could have done this at the same time he did the last indictment 60 days ago. But if he did it that way, he wouldn't have been able to get two smear news stories against me, which is just what he likes to do. And after this third indictment, I don't think there are too many people left around who don't realize that this all is Mr. Morgenthau's vendetta. In his own trial involving the Fifth Avenue Coach Company, his lawyer had a heart attack. Roy got up and delivered his own defense. Seven hours of his own defense without looking at a note. Cohn kept appealing to patriotism. He said, "I love the United States of America", and I can't believe that most of the people in this great country think that I could ever commit a criminal act.” He's just lying to save his skin. It had a tremendous impact on the jury. The foreman of the jury came back the next day wearing an American flag in his lapel. And he was acquitted. I mean, he was really the Teflon fraud. This is just the most relieved and happy moment of my life. And the way I feel is the way I feel every day in my life, which is God bless America. Roy Cohn understood the political value of wrapping yourself in the flag. It's not surprising that he would meet with reporters and say, "God bless America." He always made very good copy. Cohn was, in part, powerful not just because he was a good lawyer and a killer lawyer. He was also powerful because he had press relationships. And the press was beholden to him because he was feeding them information. This gave him a dimension beyond just being a lawyer. Roy knew how to shape events that he was involved in through his manipulation of the press. Roy Cohn had learned his lessons from the McCarthy era well. He learned the press will accurately quote whatever you say. The headlines and the top of the story, and a lot of people don't read beyond the first few paragraphs, would be your version of events. Cohn had a coterie of reporters, sort of the predecessors and precursors of Fox News, to whom he would leak information. He would sit back at the dining-room table, and he would actually dictate copy for both the New York Post and the Daily News. "Period, paragraph, new paragraph, comma, exclamation point." I've never seen anybody do that. From the very beginning, he tried to co-opt me. He would give me horrible items about people, and I wouldn't pay any attention. But he did tell me a lot of incredible things. He was consumed with a driving force to make himself famous, to be with famous people, to make himself powerful. That was where the motives were. In 1927, Roy's uncle, Bernie Marcus, owned the Bank of United States. The Depression comes, and, of course, many banks had trouble. When the stock market failed, the Bank of United States was the first big bank to fail. There was a run on the bank. The only banks big enough to cover this run were the Morgan banks or the Rockefeller banks. But they said something to the effect, "We don't care about the Jewish bank. Let them go." There's crowds in the streets, the bank is closed, the doors are locked. The immigrants lost all their money. It was tragic in the Jewish community. It was tragic for the country. My grandfather, Bernie Marcus, was hauled away to Sing Sing. And that was the ultimate disgrace. The social shame of that to the family was enormously deep. Thrown out of every country club, thrown out of the Harmonie Club. There was a lot wrong with the trial that ended up putting Bernie in prison. And Roy had said that if he were Bernie's attorney at the time, he would have gotten him off, and probably could have. That failure of his Uncle Bernie was a huge part of what motivated Roy. He had to let people know that although his uncle had lost it, he had made it. Roy had a huge standard of living. Boats, planes, the best table at the 21 Club or the Stork Club. And the firm paid, because they were all business-related. You know, Roy was never a partner in the firm. That didn't mean anything to him. He was Roy Cohn. I mean, he's the chief. This was the '60s and '70s, when fame was becoming everything in New York. And this was part of his need to have these very wealthy friends. His need to have a Rolls-Royce and let everybody know it. Actually, he had two Rolls-Royces. One that was a convertible. He always wanted the sun. And to look like he just came out of Miami Beach. I think it was Aristotle Onassis who said, "You can never be too rich or too tan." Roy Cohn took this to heart. He had a speedboat, and often during the summer, he would take a bunch of us up to 79th Street. Now, the Hudson River was so polluted in the late '60s. I mean, nobody would go 10 feet near the Hudson River. And he went waterskiing. And we went under the George Washington Bridge. It was perfect Roy Cohn. It was the way he lived, bigger than life. Roy took a house in Mexico every year. And every time I would go there to meet with Roy, there'd be a knock on my door at the office, and his mother Dora would bring me some jockey shorts and cans of tuna fish. So Roy would have what he liked all the time. His mother took care of him. With her, it was, "Did you eat your breakfast?" "Don't listen to him. He's wrong. You're right, Roy." Bucking him up, always supporting him. He became a little boy around his mother. I gather he lived in fear of Dora knowing that he was gay. Now, that's an odd thing, because he was in his 30s and 40s, but Dora chose not to see it. After his mother died, things changed very rapidly. A fellow who drove his car disappeared. There was a new driver, much more handsome. And there was a new captain of the yacht, also much more handsome. Roy was hung up on a specific type. I was his epitome of looks, like, you know, the very... He liked blond-haired, you know, Nordic look, like David Schine. Even the lawyers he would hire... They were straight, but they were that type of look. Roy and the law firm of Saxe, Bacon and Bolan moved into an Upper East Side townhouse. On East 68th Street, which was an awfully fancy block. I believe it was between Madison and Park. The idea that it was an office and a residence was a little unusual. You'd meet in the living room. Or you'd meet in his bedroom, which was, I think, on the fourth floor of the building. He'd be in a bathrobe, and he... That's the way business was conducted. What I saw were two Cohns. In a suit and tie, he was Roy Cohn, killer lawyer. At his apartment... I remember thinking, this is a different Roy Cohn. He's letting himself be. My recorder is going, and I said, "Roy, let me ask you a question." Many people who I've talked to have said to me, "Do you know that Roy is a homosexual?" Long pause. He didn't answer for seconds. I mean, maybe five, six seconds. I... I... would answer you this way. Anybody who knows me, or knows anything about me, or who knows the way my mind works, would have an awfully hard time reconciling, uh... that with any kind of, uh, uh, homosexuality. In other words, every facet of my personality, my aggressiveness and my toughness, and everything along those lines, is just totally, I suppose, incompatible with anything like that. But he didn't say he was, he didn't say he wasn't. But he squirmed, which gave me great amount of pleasure. Because in a way, I was doing to him, in this personal interview, what he had done to people in the McCarthy hearings, putting them on the spot. "Are you now, or have you ever been a Communist?" I wanna ask you about this. To me, the nicest thing... Let's be affirmative. The nicest thing that I have ever heard about Joe McCarthy was told me by Senator Flanders of Vermont, that he was a full-time homosexual. Is this true? No. I'm sure you think that merited a badge of honor, but it is not true. Well, I'm getting to you in a minute, but what about Senator McCarthy? Sure, you... I mean, that's your favorite topic of conversation, I know that. - I know... Aroused by the obvious. - By the way... I know. He was a very hypocritical guy. He was engaged for a while to Barbara Walters. We're getting married when we're both 60. She and Roy had grown up together, and she never deserted him. But she was annoyed by Roy going around saying he was gonna marry her. She knew that was absurd. This is a guy who ostensibly was a multimillionaire, one of the most powerful people in New York. There was a little Disney sign that said "Roy" on it on his bedroom door. The door opened... I only saw it once, but the door opened, and there was a mirror. I was young. I didn't know that people had mirrors on the ceilings of their bedrooms. So there was a mirror there, a huge bed, and there were just people in and out all day long. Which is also a kind of recreation room and office and gallery for his collection of frogs. Roy had a lot of miniature animals and stuffed animals and things that... In his apartment that you wouldn't expect... a killer lawyer to have. He admits to a certain vanity, religious about doing his 200 sit-ups every day. All this while dictating to his male secretary, Vincent Millard. Did you remember I had a lunch date with Barbara Walters? - When is that? - Today. Every time I had a meal with him, he didn't order very much, and sometimes he didn't order. With his fingers, he would take food off my plate. If you're Roy and you're always doing exercise and you're always staying thin, and yet you eat off of somebody's plate, it doesn't count. It's like everything in his life. There was this image, and then there was reality, which totally contradicted it. He had a really bad facelift, with these enormous gashes, and stitches on the side of his face. You'd say, "Roy, did you have surgery?" And he said, "No, not me. Why? I feel fine." So, I mean, he would even deny that he'd had this surgery when he should have been home in bed with ice on lit. He was very vain in that sense. There was a strange contradiction about Roy. He was totally ugly and totally charismatic at the same time. A lot of people say they see you with a lot of good-looking young men. I like young people. There's no question about that. ! like being around young people. They're more fun. The people that he had sex with were not very well-educated, did not come from good families. That was a separate part of his life. He had to have sex every day. Every day. And preferably with someone who was new. He took a lot of Valium. He'd get so frustrated with those childproof bottles. He'd always... "Can you open this thing?" And it wasn't, like, one pill. It was, like, just dump them in there and take them. In the end of the evening, I went to take my coal, and it was, like, stuffed full of hundred-dollar bills. Every time I reached into a pocket, there was several hundred-dollar bills. When everyone left, I would go in and lay down on the bed with him, and, like, I'd look up at the mirror, and he would look up at the mirror, and we would talk. I asked him, "So are you the girl or the boy?" And he said, "I'm the girl." There were rumors that he was picking up male prostitutes all around the city. He was really a personality in disarray. A personality in anarchy. Which had no rules, it had no scruples, it had no boundaries. He was someone who lived on the edge. And he enjoyed living on the edge, because it was dangerous. The power politics of New York, the favor bank, was very closely linked to organized crime. And this was a milieu in which Roy Cohn fit in perfectly. - Then tell me what direction. - You got 50 people here... Cohn began to represent mobsters. He represented all of the New York families that controlled La Cosa Nostra. Galante arrived at the federal courthouse in a long black limousine and walked inside, shielded from photographers by two of his daughters. - Aah! - Stop it. Please! Galante is now regarded by federal authorities as one of the most important men in the Mafia. - Come on, Daddy, run! - What are you doing here today? Turn around and roll, Frank. - Come on, baby. Let's go. Let's go. - Stop pushing me! - Are you Mr. Galante's attorney? - Yeah. - And what is your name, sir? - Roy Cohn. Federal investigator said Mr. Galante is the boss of organized crime in this country. Would that be a correct characterization, the godfather of the New York Mafia? From my experience, practically everything they've said is totally incorrect and inaccurate. - You believe they're not treating your client fairly? - Pardon me? No, I just said it's just a total publicity stunt, or all of you wouldn't be here, right? What are you doing here today? I'm a lawyer. He was very clever in protecting his clients, by far and large, from long criminal sentences that would put them out of business. Roy was assigned by the Gambino Crime Family to represent John Gotti. When Gotti and a couple of his guys walked into a bar in front of a lot of witnesses and shot this guy in the head and killed him, Roy managed to get Gotti off. Instead of 25 to life on a murder, got him into some degree of manslaughter and Gotti ended up serving only two years in prison. Amazing that he did that. An excellent result for Gotti and a great injustice at the same time. As a result of that case, Roy had a perpetual client of the Mafia. Tony Salerno, recently indicted, has long been one of Roy Coho's clients. Tony, you've read the charges in this indictment. - Did you do any of those things to anyone? - All false. Cohn was more an advisor. He was the guy who whispered in the ear of the don and told him what to say, what to do. He was full of advice. What are you gonna do when you get to the country? Well, I mean, I planted peppers last week. Now I'm gonna plant tomatoes. His name is Carmine Galante, the late Carmine Galante, who the papers said was the godfather of the Mafia. You think that had an influence on the federal judge, when he held that you were right and the Parole Commission was wrong? - I think so. - He thinks a farmer ought to be able to seed. I think so. I mean, it's very well known that that's what I do. A few months after this meeting, he was gunned down as he sipped a glass of wine. Present for the service was Roy Cohn, who had been Galante's lawyer through many of the mobster's legal difficulties. I pass no moral judgment on Mr. Galante any more than I pass a moral judgment on anybody else, because that's for the Almighty to do, not for me. Do you have any idea why he was murdered? Uh... As somebody once said a long time ago is, "All I know is what I read in the papers." The Mafia was the entire power underbelly of the city. And Roy had all of the network at his disposal. Steinbrenner would be on line one, and Carmine Galante would be on line two, and some Mafia boss who had a cement company would be on line three, and somebody would be waiting, Roger Stone would be in the anteroom. And Roy wanted that attention. He was an only child whose mother doted on him every second. And he needed that attention years after she died. There's a story about Dora that gives you a pretty good insight into Roy's relationship with his mother and into how Roy operated. Every Jewish family has its own Passover story, and our story is an unusual one. I was the youngest child, and as such, I had to ask the Four Questions. First question was, "Why is this night different from all others?" And Dora finally blurted out... "Why is this night different? Because the maid's dead in the kitchen!" Turns out the housekeeper passed away, was in the kitchen, dead. And in order not to disrupt the Passover dinner, Dora saw to it that the housekeeper was kept in the kitchen under the serving table. She was embarrassed about how it interrupted the Seder, not the fact that a life had been lost. That's totally Roy's spirit. His lack of ethics, his lack of empathy. That came from Dora. For Roy, life was transactional. It was all about connections and accruing power. If I said to you, "Roy Cohn, what are your flaws?" What are my flaws? Okay, I'll tell you what my flaws are. My flaws are being completely tactless. I cannot listen to baloney. Impatience. A total failure to sympathize with the emotional element in life. The biggest business in New York then, and it probably still is now, was real estate. That's where the real power was. He represented a number of real-estate figures, among them Donald Trump. Donald Trump grows up in a household where his father Fred is deeply mobbed up. His business partner, Willie Tomasello, is an associate of the Gambino and Genovese crime families. So Donald comes to Manhattan to make a name for himself. He naturally gravitates toward Roy Cohn, the consigliere for the head of the Gambino family and the head of the Genovese family. Short answers or...? Well, whatever you'd like. It doesn't matter. - I'm not as long as Archbishop O'Connor, but... - No one is. Mr. Cohn, how did you meet Donald Trump? I met him at a New York club called Le Club. And we were seated at tables next to each other. We were introduced. He was 23 years old then. He said, "Listen." He said, "I've spent two days with these establishment law firms" about a case we have." It was a civil-rights case or something. "And they were all telling us, give up, do this, sign a decree and all of that." He says, "I followed your career, and you seem..." You're a little bit crazy like I am, and you stand up to the establishment. Can I come see you?" And I said, "Sure." The Justice Department was going after Fred Trump and Donald Trump for not letting blacks in their housing. Rather than making a deal, rather than admitting guilt, Roy said to Trump, "You need to go full-bore after the Justice Department." Roy Cohn was very clear what to do: attack. Don't settle. Don't apologize. Attack. Roy would always be for an offensive strategy. Those are the rules of war. You don't fight on the other guy's ground. You define what the debate is gonna be about. I think Donald learned that from Roy. I learned that from Roy. Roy Cohn began this whole new mode of what you see today, of get off the issue, attack law enforcement, attack the government, attack the press. Create phony issues So that you can totally change the debate. - Here's a little McCarthyism going on right now. - He shouldn't disclaim... I mean, total inability to cope with any of these current topics. - He does it with great... With great pre... - Keep talking, Roy. Keep talking. - Great precision. - Keep talking. - This is known as "filler." You know, what... You... - Well, I... You throw your mud, and then the filler goes on until they've forgotten what the point was. They counterclaimed against the government for $100 million. Now, the counterclaim was soon dismissed, but had the effect of keeping the opponent off balance. We fought it, and we did extremely well. For all practical purposes, we won the case together. Trump settled, but that, for him, was a victory, because he didn't admit he did anything wrong. And it's very consistent with Roy's advice. "Never admit you're wrong. Never apologize." Settling is not an apology. In fact, Donald Trump, when he settles, he often times will cast the settlement as a victory, not a defeat. Ever since that day, he knows I have the same kind of crazy fight in me that he has in him, and he knows that... He believes you can fight city hall. I believe you can fight city hall. And we both fought it together. Cohn looked at Donald Trump as something of a protege. He saw him as a man who was governed by the same sort of situational ethics. They were cut from the same cloth, in many respects. Roy Cohn begins teaching Donald, "Here's how you keep law enforcement off your back." Don't leave a paper trail. Don't keep a calendar. Never do things in writing. And if somebody gets onto you, rat out other people.” Steve, you're gonna have to start pushing these people a bit, because it's getting ridiculous, as far as I'm concerned. So just start pushing and start pushing as hard as possible. Cohn taught Trump how to ingratiate yourself with powerful people and how to manipulate them for your own ends. Roy, just hold on here. You have to make a very special wish. It was like this funny game he played that he could bring someone like me, you know, to these total antigay Republican stronghold of a party, you know? And no one would say a word. Roy Coho's friends justified him as a friend. They knew about the McCarthy years, the Army-McCarthy hearings, some of the dastardly things that Roy may have done. But that was overwhelmed by their feeling that he was their friend, and genuine friend, and they cared about him. I've tried to give loyalty, and I've tried to give friendship, and I find in life, when you extend friendship and you extend loyalty, you get it back. He was the one who threw the great parties, who knew Norman Mailer, who hung out with Andy Warhol. All these people who were larger-than-life people, they were orbiting Roy. Everybody came, mayors, governors, police chiefs, firemen, anybody from the newspaper. Who didn't go? And Cardinal Spellman would come. Real-estate magnates would come. Trump would go. And there he would see the leading politicians of New York City who would be very helpful to him in his business. He navigates this world between the people who hang out at Sardi's and the 21 Club, and this other world that has these mobsters, and it creates a sort of glamour. So Cohn is this bridge between the legitimate world and the illegitimate world. Cohn was a legend in his own mind. If you approach things that way, pretty soon, the appearance contributes to the reality. Everyone knows the most famous legal eagle, my pal and yours, Roy Cohn. - Good evening, Nikki. How are you? - I'm fine. How are you? Well, this is a very exciting occasion. Here is Trump Tower. Marble waterfalls, the greatest stores in the world. When something like this can be created in New York and take the city by storm, it's a real event. Donald Trump wanted to construct a building, which is now known as Trump Tower, at Fifth Avenue between 56th and 57th Street. He got a hold of the Bonwit Teller department store, this prime piece of real estate. Donald hires, to tear down the building, a Syracuse window-washing firm with no experience whatsoever. And it uses 200 illegal immigrants from Poland. And then they don't get paid. Buildings of that sort at the time were made largely with structural steel, because to make them out of concrete was quite costly and also involved dealing with the Mob, which controlled the poured-contract industry in New York. Strangely, Trump chose to make it out of concrete. Now, why out of concrete? Because Cohn introduced him to his Mafioso clients, and it was through them that he was able to make the deal. Everything about this project was corrupt. Donald Trump is probably one of the most important names in America today. What started off as a meteor mounting from New York and going upward is gonna touch the rest of this country and parts... Good parts of the world. Donald just wants to be the biggest winner of all. Donald had the money, and Roy had the balls and the shrewdness, and also some of the connections to move Trump beyond the world of housing developments in Queens and Brooklyn. And it was clearly mutually beneficial. Let me tell you about this. This is a picture of Donald and me, in which he says, "Roy is my greatest friend." And then there's a letter from him. He says, "Needless to say, your representation of me" with regard to the Trump Tower case was brilliant. Everyone scoffed at our pursuit "of this difficult victory, saying it couldn't be done." Now, here's a typical Donald Trump. He's got to come in with a crack at the end. He says, "The skeptics, however, were at a disadvantage." They never saw Roy Cohn in action, especially when he really wants to win." By the way, this picture hangs in my office directly next to a picture I treasure of the president and Mrs. Reagan. Two of my favorites. Roy was responsible, according to Roy, for everything important that happened in the United States, whether it's an election of a governor, an election of a president. If you had been attorney general when Richard Nixon was in office during the Watergate times, do you think you could have solved that problem? I think Nixon could have solved the problem, Tom. Or counseled him on how to solve it. I think the problem could have been solved very easily by getting rid of the tapes. Roy Coho's reach in American politics is absolutely extraordinary. He's got Richard Nixon as a connection because Nixon's rise depended on the whole anti-Communist fervor. Has connections to Ronald Reagan, who cooperated with the McCarthy-type investigations in the early 50's. Cohn became an important figure in Republican politics. He was a registered Democrat, yet he most closely identified with the political right. In 1980, Reagan won the election because Roy Cohn arranged for John Anderson, who had challenged Reagan for the Republican nomination, to be the liberal party nominee. There's a three-way split in New York. That three-way split allows Reagan to win the electoral votes with 45 percent of the vote. It was a setup, and it worked. I was present in his office when Nancy Reagan called him and thanked him for getting her husband elected. John Anderson wasn't the only political fix Roy was responsible for. He also torpedoed the vice-presidential campaigns of Eagleton in '72... and Ferraro in '84. Roy was the one who made the link between organized crime and her husband. The New York Post and the Daily News, as you might imagine, went to town. Cohn saw himself as a political puppeteer. He started an evolution. This would certainly be the beginning of the infiltration of the political-right media into American government. Rupert Murdoch and the New York Post endorsement is something that Roy Cohn works on every day for eight months, mostly by giving Rupert Murdoch himself a window into Reagan's campaign. It's not surprising that he could be with Ronald Reagan and Rupert Murdoch, who developed Fox News, in the Oval Office, as though he engineered the entire relationship. You can see what Cohn set into motion, winding up with the type of political environment we have today. I can't think of anything else like him in American history or anywhere. People should have ignored him and put him in jail. And here he is flying around in his own plane to go have dinner at the White House. Go figure that out. I think the Reagan anticrime program is gonna take the emphasis off certain types of white-collar crimes, minor things... That's good for you. Minor things and all that, and put it on where the real root of the problem is, violent crimes, so that the people of this country are once again in control instead of the criminals. - Are you running for any office? - No. Have you been called by the government of France to restore the guillotine and conduct a campaign there? No, but I'll tell you, I'd like to restore capital punishment in the United States so that when people are gonna kill a policeman or people are gonna mug and kill an old person, they're gonna think twice. He did whatever he wanted. And he felt he was good enough at everything to get away with it, and he did for a very, very long time. Roy Cohn has managed to stay out of jail all these years, and I admire him for that, and I'd like to have him for my lawyer. Roy famously argued that all of the expenses of his law firm were... You know, were deductible. The IRS did not see it this way. Roy told me that the whole point of dealing with the IRS was to die owing them as much as humanly possible. The United States government filed a lawsuit against Roy Cohn for failing to pay nearly $7 million in back taxes. You are a tax avoider. No, I'm not. I'm a tax avoider? We're all tax avoiders. - The president's a tax avoider. Everybody's... - You're more successful at it than some of us. Don't blame me for your inadequacy. Here was a guy who was so evidently crooked, he was so evidently dishonest, yet nobody was doing anything about it. There were serious disciplinary complaints, and they were sitting at the bottom of the desk drawer for years. Last question today. A fair number of people say Roy Cohn is amoral. He will use anything to win, do anything to win. Employ any trick, any subterfuge, etcetera. I'd say that has to come, probably, from people who have lost to me. - Because [... - But here... - No, wait a minute. Let's stop right there. - Yeah, sure. He was eventually disbarred for stealing from his own clients and trying to defraud his own clients. Ultimately, we disbarred him on the basis of four cases. SEC brings a case against the Pied Piper yacht company. Almost all the money from the company has managed not to go to the creditors, but they've gone to Roy Cohn and his partners. Second, he stole from his client by promising to pay her back when he had no intention of paying her back, and then lying about it. And third, he tried to deceive a dying, incompetent man to making him the executor of his will. One of Roy Coho's major clients was Schenley, a distributor of liquors and wines. And Lew Rosenstiel, its chairman, was a personal friend of Roy's. Among the charges brought against Roy were the fact that he had documents executed in a hospital room when Mr. Rosenstiel was not capable of knowing what he was doing. My dad had a stroke, and he was in a hospital in Miami. These two people appeared at the hospital... one of whom was wheeling the bed around and fixing the covers. It was then made clear to me that it was Roy Cohn, and that Roy was having my father sign some papers awarding himself as trustee of my father's estate. The squibbly and scrawling signature at the bottom of the last will and testament of multimillionaire Lewis Rosenstiel purports to be that of the late Miami philanthropist, designating attorney Roy Cohn, Rosenstiel's granddaughter Kathy Finkelstein, and her husband James as trustees of a $50 million estate. Other members of the Rosenstiel family are contesting the will's authenticity. His signature was illegible. Scrolly sort of X, and a little wandering down off the line. There's no image on that line that looks anything like any letter of the alphabet. I mean, it was ridiculous. You were cited as dressing up as a male nurse and getting a fraudulent codicil signed to the will. - What's interested in it... What's more interest... - What I thought was amazing was the judge said... Hey, mister, what's more interesting, interesting to me, is how somebody like you, who's aspiring to be one of the leaders of the future, could have your facts so screwed up. I was no... Never any insinuation that I could have dressed up as a male nurse or anything like that. And the charge you are referring to was thrown out by the Bar Association in New York. Why'd you appeal the case, Mr. Cohn? Why do I have to appeal when I win? - Did you win, Mr. Cohn? I thought you lost. - Yes, well, maybe you... You would've been disbarred as a member of the Florida Bar. Oh, jeez. He was a liar. There are a year and a half worth of hearings in which he challenges everything and tells the same lies all over again. He makes the matter worse and makes an application to the D.C. Bar where he lied under oath. He tells lies about the Rosenstiel codicil. He tells lies about the Schlesinger. He just tells the same lies over and over and over again. If you see a pattern there, you're not foolish. And if you have no conscience about... Or shame about whether you're telling an untruth or you're using hyperbole, you get away with it. When he was about to be disbarred, It was no surprise who shows up as character witnesses for Roy Cohn, but Barbara Walters, William F. Buckley Jr., Donald Trump. The same people who he had cultivated and who, in effect, had used him over decades. Thirty-seven witnesses testified. You know what they all said under oath? "Roy Cohn has an excellent reputation in the community for integrity." And they said that with a straight face after taking an oath? Man, that's power. Here's what the Disciplinary Committee of the Bar says about you. "Quote," A total absence of moral character and professional fitness. A cruel public use of your iliness. "Pleading for clemency for a dying lawyer and showing up in court the next day." They couldn't say it about me, because I never cited my illness as a reason for anything. Anyone who knows me knows I don't plead, and I'm not pleading in this case. I don't like any of them. I've called them a bunch of yoyos. And there might be other lawyers who have a guilty conscience or feel they have to crawl. But I don't have a guilty conscience, and I'm not gonna crawl before this committee or any committee like it. He wouldn't plead to anything. Roy Cohn went out and hired excellent lawyers. But we had him. He wasn't getting out of this. He was a pinned moth. Roy gave a private dinner for his closest friends and relatives every year. And the one I was invited to took place after he had been disbarred. And when I got there, this long table was set, and nobody came. He had a lot of friends until he was disbarred, and then he had no friends. They all ran away. I wanna know why he's objecting to the way people are treating him now. Why don't he remember what he did, not only with McCarthy, but with Fifth Avenue bus lines, Lionel Trains, and is he proud of his record as an attorney? I'll hang up. - Okay. - Okay, the answer is yes. I am proud of my record. When you would try to get him to talk about Joe McCarthy or the Army-McCarthy trials or that whole period, J. Edgar Hoover, you couldn't get much out of him. On the Rosenbergs, I asked him how he felt about it. I told him I'd read the case, and he said, and I quote, "If I could've pulled the switch, I'd have done it myself." That doesn't sound like remorse. I think Roy was a hardliner to the end. You feel pretty good. - I feel great. - Why? I mean, you were at death's door, six months ago, three months ago? They found I had liver cancer and they found that... Which spreads in strange directions. - Tell me... I'm in total remission. - Are you in remission? When I talk to friends and tell them that I am doing a profile of Roy Cohn, they say, "Ask him this, please." And I'm sure you know what they tell me to ask you. - Do you have AIDS? - Oh, no. That's easy to answer. Peter Fraser, his companion, helped him everywhere. Roy was forgetting things left and right, which never had happened before. And he looked at me with these pale blue eyes and these hooded kind of eyes, and quivering, and he said... I said, "They say you have AIDS." And he said, "Who is they, and what do they know about me?" Even at the end, he refused to admit that he was gay, and he refused to admit that he had AIDS. It was almost hard for me to believe because of the man I had grown to know. It was a mistake for Roy to deny that he had AIDS. It was a mistake to deny that he was a homosexual. If he had come out and said, "Look, I'm homosexual. I have AIDS." We need to do something, not just for me, but for the community,” he would have been a hero. Instead, he was a hypocrite. And at the same time, he took advantage of his connections to get special treatment. The Reagan White House actually got him into the National Institutes of Health to do an experimental treatment that nobody could get into. So here was President Reagan and all the people around him basically denying there was an AIDS epidemic, and yet Roy was flying down there and going there a lot for this experimental treatment. And he acted like he was there on a mistake. He didn't really have AIDS. You know, he never gave up on his own myth. Are you gonna win this one too? You're darn right I am, Larry. Thanks for being with us, Roy. I enjoyed it, and I hope not so much time goes until I'm with you again. Roy was incredibly loyal to friends. And he was intensely loyal to Donald Trump. Trump took his legal business to somebody else when Roy had AIDS. He stopped seeing Roy and calling Roy and hanging out with Roy. You know, of course, why people ask about AIDS and Roy Cohn? - Sure. Of course. Of course. - Because they believe that you're a homosexual. And that you simply have never acknowledged the fact. And a good friend of mine, and a good friend of yours, I should say... Tell him, if he wants to admit anything, he can, but it's a lie. No, a good friend of mine who is a woman says that she believes that Roy Cohn wants to, in effect, come out of the closet. "Come out of the closet" meaning, make a very dramatic statement about... Yeah, just acknowledge it. There's certainly nothing horrible about it. Mike, we've been here, we've been doing a very intensive 20 minutes or more on me. Um... I think you can see me. I think you can see, and the audience can, I ain't dying from nothing, to start with, number one. - Right. Right. - Number two, you asked me categorically. And I tell you categorically, I do not have AIDS. - Where do all these stories come from? - It's a cinch, Mike. Take this set of facts. Bachelor, unmarried, middle-aged. Well, young middle-aged, and, um... Uh... Then all the stories go back to the McCarthy/Sohtne days. Schine was a bachelor too. - We were both bachelors. - So was McCarthy. Right, and so was McCarthy. At that point, his phone calls are erratic. They don't make much sense. He tires very, very easily. I called the hospital. I asked for his room, and Tom Bolan answered the phone. And I said, "Tom, I wanna see Roy." And Tom said, "Don't come. It's too late." "He won't recognize you." He said he's... And then I realized I had missed my chance to say goodbye. If you had a chance to write your epitaph... how would you like to be remembered? I guess I would like to be remembered most... Look, I... We know what my epitaph is gonna be in all the papers. What's it gonna be? It's gonna be "Roy Cohn dies, was McCarthy chief aide." No matter what I do, good or bad, for the rest of the years of my life, that's what it's going to be. My mother told me that she found a list of Roy's career path. It started out as prosecutor, which he was right out of law school. And then a series of political positions, ending up with governor of New York. He never reached the kind of public-policy power that he had envisioned himself as having. But it's undeniable that his impact on politics lives on. Roy was an evil... produced by certain parts of the American culture. There always is the possibility of another person who cares not about our traditions or our laws or our protections who can come in and wreck it, and wreck it for the weakest among us and the most vulnerable. Power in the hands of someone who is that reckless and that arrogant is a very dangerous thing.
