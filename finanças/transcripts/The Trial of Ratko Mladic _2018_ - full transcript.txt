A UN tribunal will imminently deliver its long-awaited verdict in the war crimes trial of former Bosnian-Serb military commander, Ratko Mladic, known as the Butcher of Bosnia. Mladic is charged with 11 counts of war crimes, including genocide and the massacre of thousands of Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica in 1995. GUNSHOTS EXPLOSION SCREAMS Any last-minute thoughts? Everybody ready to roll? We've got this. OK, everybody, we're going to court. We are sitting today to deliver the chamber's judgment in this case. The chamber has sat for 530 trial days, during which it received the evidence of 592 witnesses and nearly 10,000 exhibits. The indictment charged two counts of genocide, and five counts of crimes against humanity, namely prosecution, murder, extermination, deportation and the inhumane act of forcible transfer. The chamber will now give its verdict. Tomorrow, I'll be standing here, where the podium is. Mr Groome will be sat next to me and Arthur will be sitting at the end. So, when I walk in tomorrow, everyone is going to be here, pretty much? Everybody will be here, yes. Even the defence. The defence is going to be here and Mladic will already be in the courtroom. OK. And he does have the two security guys on each side of him. The big thing to remember when you come in is a deep breath. Yes. I'm a little bit nervous. Brings the memories back. The first witness that's testifying is an extraordinary young man, who was 14 at the time, Elvedin Pasic, and it's a crime that occurred in 1992 and it mirrors the crime committed in Srebrenica in 1995. And we have decided to call him first, because it really demonstrates the way that Mladic approached war and his willingness to commit terrible crimes. That is the public gallery behind you. He will just tell, in his own words, what happened to him and his family. And my wife is going to be somewhere in the back room? Yes. OK. Yes, she will be back, right behind you. OK. This is case RT0992T, the prosecutor versus Ratko Mladic. Mr Groome, is the prosecution ready to make its opening statement? It is, your honour. Then you may proceed. Your honours, four days ago, marked two decades since Ratko Mladic became the commander of the main staff of the Army of Republika Srpska, the VRS. On that day, Mladic began his full participation in a criminal endeavour of ethnically cleansing much of Bosnia. The world watched in disbelief that in neighbourhoods and villages, within Europe, civilians were targeted for no other reason than they were an ethnicity other than Serb. The next time I address you about the evidence in this case will be at the end of the trial. At that time, when I come before you again, I will ask that you give the people of Bosnia what they have waited so long for. The truth about what Ratko Mladic did to that beautiful and complex land. The truth about what Ratko Mladic did to Bosnia's people. Is the prosecution is ready to call its first witness? Your honour, the prosecution is ready to call its first witness, Mr Elvedin Pasic. I solemnly declare that I will speak the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, your honour. Thank you, Mr Pasic, please be seated. You will now first be examined by Miss Bibles, who's counsel for the prosecution. Good afternoon, Mr Pasic. Could you tell us the size and ethnicity of your village? My village, Hrvacani, was 100% Muslim. And approximately 100 houses. I draw your attention to May of 1992, was there a religious occasion celebrated in your village? Yes. We were celebrating our holiday, Bajram. The first day, we went to the mosque, I was excited, as being a little boy. On our second day, we were attacked. The bombs and the shells start landing in our village. We were instructed to form three lines and to lay down in this puddle of mud and water. I was laying down next to... My dad was on my left-hand side, and my uncle was on my right-hand side. And as I was laying down, they ordered us, all the women and children, to get up. And at first I didn't want to get up, because I was afraid to separate from my dad. And he told me to get up. I told him, "No, I don't want to go without you." He says, "Get up." And my uncle insisted. He says, "Get up, you will survive." Since I'm reliving and going back to this, I had a dream about my dad last night. For the first time, I was able to see his face. I'm glad, because in most of the dreams, nightmares, that I have from the personal experience, I was always trying to reach him. I saw his face last night. I miss my dad. Can you find my dad, please? I would like to find my dad. EXPLOSION NEWS REPORT: Yugoslavia, a country at war with itself. Ever since Croatia and Slovenia declared their independence, a nation of six republics is being dismantled by an apparently unchecked force. Now it's feared that the buffer Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina could become the next theatre of conflict. Violence has broken out in the Republic of Bosnia Herzegovina, after its population voted at the weekend for independence from the rest of Yugoslavia. 43% of the Republic's population are Muslim. 31% are Serbs and 17% are Croats. The Muslims and Croats support independence, the Serbs are fiercely opposed to it. Last night, the Serbs proclaimed a breakaway republic inside Bosnia, and today their leader, Radovan Karadzic said they'd have to make their Serbian state, whatever the cost may be. There is chaos and anarchy, no functioning central authority and the United Nations headquartered here is apparently powerless to intervene. What remains of the Bosnian government has declared a state of war. General Ratko Mladic. He is the scourge of Sarajevo, the Chief Warrior of the Serbs. He's called Ratko Mladic. He is a man who has no doubts, only a total assurance that he's right, the world wrong, and that his people have been slandered. Well, General Mladic is my eighth client in front of the tribunal. And it's obvious this is the most important case in my career. My memories from the war were, of course, horrible. I had parents in Doboj. It was Serb-held territory... ..but bombed and shelled every day. My parents were protected by General Mladic and his soldiers. And he would tell me, always, "Your parents live in Doboj "thanks to me." We, of course, would have preferred having the Mladic's trial starting already many, many years before. And you are for sure right when he arrived in The Hague last year, his health situation was far from perfect. It is very, very difficult to measure the extreme importance of the arrest of Mladic. We were looking for him for 16 years. When he arrived, it was a few days after his last stroke. He arrived as a very sick man. Today, I think his situation is much, much better, but we will see what happens. We have a lot of staff working extremely hard to make sure that this case can advance as fast as possible. Hey, good afternoon. I wanted to just have a quick meeting today, to kind of just touch base on the preparation. Things are starting to pick up speed. The two senior trial attorneys were very experienced. They have been working at this tribunal for many, many years. Dermot is somehow the coordinator, the organiser, and Peter McCloskey, we call him sometimes, "Mr Srebrenica", because he has done a number of Srebrenica cases. The sound is very important on this one, which sounds perfect. I am up pretty much at maximum. That's where we want to be. OK. Zoran is helping me with the clip of a Muslim man, is it Ramo? Ramo. Ramo Osmanovic. He's calling... The Serbs are making him call to bring other Muslims out of the woods and he is calling his son, Nermin. Can you check Nermin and his father, where they were found? Can you imagine how hard it is to call your son and then they kill your son? They promise you that they will save them, cos if they surrender they would be all safe. So, he's calling his son, his son came, and... Bye. I was just asking the investigator to give me the details of which mass grave they were found in, so that I can tell the court that. If I watch too much of it, I... You know, I still get... It gets to you. I got here in the fall of 1996. And I was meeting survivors at the refugee camps and getting to know them, and hearing their stories. At the same time, on the same missions, I was with the investigator and we would travel into the Republika Srpska, with borrowed shovels from the local police and start digging in this disturbed soil, because we suspected mass graves and, sure enough, every time we found one of these places, we found body remains, which were, of course, and we understood, the loved ones of the people we had interviewed the day before. I've been so close to this work for so long and so close to the victims, it becomes rather difficult to deal with the carnage. There is a certain darkness that comes over me when this thing starts, especially when the victims are here. A human tragedy is unfolding in the eastern enclave of Srebrenica. Bosnian-Serb infantry have effectively outmanoeuvred the UN and taken control of the town. Resistance was reported to be minimal. The town was supposed to be a safe haven, protected by the moral and military force of the world community in the shape of the UN. There are hundreds and hundreds of people, around probably 20,000 or more surrounding the Dutch Battalion compound and everybody is fleeing the city. After overrunning Srebrenica town, the Serbs surrounded the UN base nearby at Potocari, where up to 40,000 refugees have gathered. The Bosnian Serb Commander in Chief, General Ratko Mladic justified the attack, stating it was to rout Muslim terrorists and to demilitarise the enclave. An operation, he added, that the UN had failed to complete. A senior UN official here today said that there was nothing the UN can do at the moment, short of going to war with the Bosnian Serbs and that is very much not on the agenda. This case involves two horrendous crimes. The forced movement of the Muslim population, together with the mass murder of thousands of Bosnian men and boys, all amounting to the elimination of the Muslim population from Srebrenica in genocide. Mladic was present in Potocari on 12th and 13th of July, while the VRS began the process of putting the women and children on buses to Muslim-controlled territory, and separating and holding the Muslim men and boys for execution. The part where I am asking you questions, I think, it is going to seem actually very short, surprisingly, and I think that you've probably been told this already, but Mladic will also be in the courtroom, sitting up behind his lawyers. We hope that he stays quiet and listens, because he should hear what you have to say. The reason we're calling Saliha Osmanovic is because she decided on the 11th of July that she had to leave with her family from Srebrenica, otherwise, she would be killed by the Serbs. You know, this is the ethnic cleansing, this is the "forcible transfer" count. And so, that is the first thing we bring out with her. Her situation was, that all of a sudden, it is not safe for us to be in our home any more. OK, there's fleeing the fighting, which is normal, and we'd all do that when the shells started. Was there anything indicated in her mind, anything else besides just fleeing shells falling? Well, it's not just shells falling, it's a sense of being, what she communicated, at least, was, "I, as a Muslim, "I am not going to be safe here." Not just I might get caught in some random crossfire, she actually said, "Yeah, it was safe if you wanted "to get your throat slit." Dobro jutro! How are you doing? Kako ste? Kako ste, I can do that too. OK. I'll see you in there in a minute. TRANSLATOR INTERPRETS OK? Mrs Osmanovic, do you recognise the man that is featured in that video? SHE CRIES You state that you went to Potocari on the 11th of July. Did you go to Potocari from the town of Srebrenica? Up until the moment that you boarded the bus in Potocari, do you feel like you could have stayed in Srebrenica if you wanted to? What is being described as deportation by the prosecution in relation to Srebrenica, was a humanitarian evacuation that was agreed to by all sides. My goal, with this witness, is to see if I can link up certain parts of her written testimony to video footage that we have of the actual events that she seems to be describing. We hope to show our client, General Mladic, acting in a very humane light, providing food and water to the civilians that were located there. The demeanour of General Mladic, is it similar to or different from the demeanour of General Mladic during the encounter that you remember with him? Madam, you mention that there was water and chocolates being handed out, was there also bread being handed out by the VRS soldiers? Mrs Osmanovic, the chamber understands that being taken back to the events must be emotional for you, we appreciate that you came. You may now follow the usher. I don't see how you did. You were just wonderful. Thank you. Danny really shook her. Although she was a victim and when you have a victim in front of you, you have to deal with the victim, very, very nicely, very softly. But still he was capable of shaking her. We have the instruction from the general to say sorry to a victim, and I never do that. It's not my job. He instructs me that, no. My job is to cross-examine. I am a lawyer, I cross-examine. If you want to apologise, write a letter. Hundreds of bodies believed to have been killed by Serb forces have been found in a mass grave in Bosnia, in the Prijedor area. They knew this grave existed for years, but Bosnian Serb witnesses kept silent about its location until... The ghosts of the missing still haunt the villages here and the graveyards still wait for the dead. This discovery could bring an end to that waiting and bring evidence of war crimes that can no longer be hidden. So once you've stripped off the top layer of earth, did you, at that stage, know that there were likely to be bodies there? We could see the changes... In the, in the earth? We need to strip this brown soil to get to this yellow... Grey clay, yes. And because, air couldn't get through that clay, bodies are well preserved. And do the pathologists think that because of that soft tissue, that they can make findings about cause of death? Exactly. OK. And a lot of this was organised by the army itself? Army and the police. The army and the police. And the local police. Prijedor was the first place to be ethnically cleansed with vicious Serb atrocities. We're very upset to see outright murder, burning people to death in their own homes, dragging them out into the street and shooting them at point blank range. Omarska concentration camp, ethnic cleansing at its most graphic. Thousands of Muslims in scenes chillingly reminiscent of the Holocaust. And you can see the different states. Yeah. You can see that one there. That'll be solid. Yeah. What kinds of injuries are you finding, the ones that you can determine an injury? Back of the head or...? There's a skull over there, which, as you can see, is being reconstructed. And all this shattering is typical of high velocity injury. Once it's all put together, we've got quite a lot of good evidence, you can...we can see from it. You can see the tragedy of it, when you look around, I mean, it's clear that these are not soldiers, these are women, there are even some children over there. This is just an outrage that these people were killed in the way that they were killed, and dumped in the site that they were dumped. In terms of the case, it's so important. Because in terms of proving that they were murdered by people that are accountable to Mladic, we need to have that evidence. So, do you find, as a military person, General Mladic's presence at this meeting, do you find that to be an exercise of command? Yes, sir. He's the commander of the Army of the Republika Srpska. Everything that he does or everything that he does not do as the commander is an exercise of command. He's not pulling the trigger, we don't have him standing at any execution site, but we have to show that he is in command of the troops that are doing it and he's fully aware of what is going on and, in fact, ordered it and began the whole process, which the evidence is very clear on. General Dannatt, from a purely military perspective, is General Mladic responsible for the conduct of his subordinates in Srebrenica? Well, it's clear to me that he exercised a large measure of personal control as to what was going on. He was known to be a big character, and therefore what he said and what he ordered, people were likely to do. Can you describe please how the Serb soldiers spoke to you and the other prisoners? Turning specifically to the time period of the executions in the field, can you tell us if you heard any exchanges between wounded men and the Serb soldiers who had been shooting them? Mr Nikolic, I would like to ask you how you feel about having participated in these events? Mr Kenjic was called to confirm the alibi that explains the movements of General Mladic from the 14th of July until 17th of July 1995... ..while Srebrenica killings happened, and through this witness we want to, among other things, prove and explain that General Mladic has nothing to do with those killings. Mr Kenjic drove Mr Mladic from Srebrenica to Belgrade on the 14th. We have meetings that he had with internationalists, we have his visit to his daughter's grave on the 15th, we have the 16th a wedding, a visit to a military medical academy, and we have his return to the 17th. Mr Mladic did not have any means of communication. He was outside the area and, by Serbian military law at that time, he was not in command. I am 100% sure that there is nothing that can touch that alibi. Thank you, Mr Stajanovic. Mr Kenjic, you'll now be cross-examined by Mr McCloskey. Good morning, Mr Kenjic. As you sit here now, do you remember, on that day, the afternoon of 14 July, which route you actually took? Were you aware, at the time, large numbers of Muslim soldiers and civilians were fleeing the Srebrenica enclave and had crossed that road, and were still in those woods all around that area where you're driving? As you drove past the Nova Kasaba area, did you see any large pits being dug near the side of the road? No. At the time that you were in Konjevic Polje with General Mladic, did you hear any information that there were hundreds and hundreds of dead and dying Muslims at the Kravica warehouse at that time? So, did you have any information about the other prisoners, roughly 800 to a thousand, at the nearby Petkovci school, the nearby Rocevic school, the Pilica cultural centre, and the Kula school? Did you hear about any of those thousands of prisoners that were in those schools at the time you're driving by that area? Nothing further, Mr President. Thank you. This guy drove Mladic right through the heart of darkness, right past or near the significant mass murder sites and gravesites. That's a very good reminder that Mladic is in the centre of things, both as a commander and as a person on the ground. As an alibi witness, you generally... ..that's a pretty tough alibi. NEWS REPORTER: To be on the wrong side of the ethnic front line in Bosnia is a terrifying experience, whoever you are. These people are Serbs, fleeing, they say, for their lives. They said they wanted to escape to friendly territory because Serbs in a village near them had been massacred by Muslim troops... Today, hundreds of Serbs attended a funeral for 39 of their men and women in a village seized by the Muslims earlier this year, recaptured by the Serbs last week... APPLAUSE FOLK MUSIC PLAYS CANNON FIRES EXCITED SHOUTS AND CHEERS For me, he is a hero firstly because he is my dad. Even for small things in life, he was so dedicated that you should do something right, never lie. He despised lies. He always told me, "You should tell me the truth, "nevertheless how difficult the truth is, because if you lied to me, "I will not know how to help you." Maybe we have a different temperament. I am more calm than he is. He is a very good person, but he can explode, he can burst. But values I openly declare are his values. I am sorry for every victim, but I cannot accept his guilt. I cannot accept what I don't believe is true, if I believe it, then I would accept it, but I can't accept it, because the other side has a need for me to do it. It a real joke to ask from us to be prepared. It's not possible. Simply not possible. And I don't think it's good example for any kind of justice, let alone international justice. We probably need at least as many lawyers as the prosecution has. We need as many investigators. We have only a couple of them. And the prosecution has the whole system. It is a real fight in between David and Goliath. That's exactly what I was afraid of before we came here. That we might have many good talks, but no witnesses. My humble opinion is that, at this moment, Bosnia does not need shows for public as Tomasica. Because it's just a show. And it's just prolongation of Bosnian agony. We should bury our dead, and we should move forward. And having wounds reopened all the time cannot help reconciliation. These are killing fields. In World War II? Yes. Yes. To understand Bosnia, it's conflict from the '90s, you have to know what happened during the World War, the second. If you do not understand Jasenovac, where we are here now, you cannot understand the conflict in Bosnia. Every single family lost its member due to that genocide committed against Serbian people. Eye for an eye is not allowed as a defence in front of this tribunal. But there was revenge. And you could not control everybody who was armed during the war, so it was not something that you could blame General Mladic and to blame Serbian leadership, that it was organised. Tomasica can be an excellent example, actually, of revenge. It can be an excellent example of continuation of this Bosnian bloody story. It happens in this area. And it happened before. And I'm afraid that it could happen in the future. I hope not. Welcome, everybody, to the 80th week of the Mladic trial. Officially on the record we are on the 333rd day. In terms of events in the trial, where is... There he is, Ed filed the Tomasica motion last week, right on schedule. Thank you very much for doing that. The most significant addition since we've had the last team meeting is that Alan Tieger is here. It's of course my pleasure to be on board. I simply look forward to working with each one of you. I hope to meet with all... It's an extraordinary responsibility and professional privilege to lead this team for this case at this point in the tribunal's existence. My parents were both survivors whose, virtually, entire families were murdered during the Holocaust. And no... No survivor truly escapes that. I could see the visible effects of those crimes every day. And I certainly felt that when I met and worked with those victims in Prijedor. Mladic is charged with seven different massacres that took place in about a six-day period in Prijedor municipality in late July 1992. More than 1000 people in Prijedor went missing during the course of about those six days. Nobody's ever been convicted of genocide here, for what happened in 1992. In Prijedor, or anywhere else. This is the last trial here, so it is the last opportunity. And I think all of us feel some sense of historical obligation to make sure that it's recorded here what happened. And General Mladic's responsibility for it. The cleansing campaign reached its most brutal apex in Prijedor municipality. What you see on this next slide is those villages which are most relevant to cleansing campaign in Prijedor. As you see, many of the communities by 1993 genuinely, literally, chillingly no longer existed. Mr Hanson, were you called upon to assist in the exhumation of the Tomasica site in 2013? Yes, I was. And did it reveal the presence of graves, and, if so, how many? Yes. Three separate graves. Were you are able to determine how much time may have transpired between the deposits of bodies? Exact timings, no. However, the bodies were very well preserved. This is consistent with a burial quite soon after death. Sir, what did you observe as the most frequent cause of death? I found that the vast majority of the people in this gravesite had been shot. A surprisingly high number of shots were to the head. A very common finding was a bullet wound, a bullet injury to the back of the head. What can you tell us about the clothes found on the bodies exhumed from Tomasica? The clothing was just ordinary clothing. Some people had suit jackets, some people had work jackets, or dungarees. But it was mostly sort of casual clothes. When, in a community like Prijedor, more than 1,500 people are murdered in a short time, thousands and thousands more starved, degraded, abused, humiliated, tormented, when most of their homes are destroyed, when their mosques are reduced to rubble, and when they are scattered to an impoverished exile... ..the intent to destroy that community and prevented from reconstituting itself is unmistakable. And the word for those crimes with that intent, is "genocide". You had occasion to meet with General Mladic in Prijedor answer, "No, I never met the general, never saw him "at any meeting that I attended, nor did I hear from anyone else "that he had been in Prijedor." Mr Marjanovic, you will now be cross-examined by Mr Traldi. Mr Traldi is counsel for the prosecution. Thanks, Mr President. Good morning, sir. Can we have 65 to 31041? Do you recognise the people in this photograph? Who is the man on the far right, looking away from the camera? And the person immediately to your right hand, with the moustache, who's that? The man next to him, in the tie? And the man next to him come on the far left? All four of you worked at RZR Ljubija before the war, right? You and Mr Balaban were Serbs, while Mr Paunovic and Mr Zahirovic were Muslims? Now, Mr Paunovic and Mr Zahirovic, have you ever seen either of them after the war? Did he know what was happening in Prijedor? Yeah, of course. It's very hard to start with 50,000 Muslims in your municipality, wind up with six a couple of months later, 6,000, and then virtually none by the end of the war, and miss that. It's too large a change in the composition of the people you interact with every day. And he would have been in downtown Prijedor, where he lived, when one of the neighbourhoods there, Stari Grad, was destroyed by the VRS. He would have been in downtown Prijedor, where he lived, when the Room 3 massacre at Keraterm occurred. Of course he knew crimes were being committed, yeah. Nobody could have missed that. Whether he knew about this grave specifically... If he didn't, it would have required a wilful attempt to avoid knowing what was being done on his property. On his company's property. The evidence of genocide presented in this courtroom for the last four and a half years was clear, comprehensive and unassailable. We have Mladic in the dock, answering for his crimes. History will judge if justice was done and seen to be done. The defence does not deny that unfortunate crimes occurred. But those in no way can be connected to General Ratko Mladic. There is no credible evidence linking General Mladic's presence to any of the alleged killing or execution sites. We should all agree that he sits here innocent before us right now. The time has come for General Mladic to be held accountable for those crimes against each of his victims and the communities he destroyed. It would be an affront to justice to impose any sentence other than the most severe available under law. We're returning now to the trial of... We're back live now, in the Hague. The United Nations War Crimes Tribunal... An international war crimes court in the Hague is delivering its verdict... You're watching continuous coverage of the verdict in the trial... Just to remind you that General Ratko Mladic had asked for a bathroom break, effectively, about 35 minutes ago. We're still trying to assess exactly what is going on here. We assume this is just a temporary pause. The Bosnian TV reported that apparently he had some medical issues and they are doing the medical checks. If he has a medical thing now, it's not a coincidence. Is it? He turned red in his face, you know? Usually when he turns red in his face, this is a sign that his blood pressure is high. And for him, this is a life-threatening situation. OK, the medical officer wanted to speak to the cardiologist, but now it seems like we're going to be resuming. Mr Mladic's blood pressure was read three times during the break. The first reading, I believe, is 175/96. The second reading, done by a nurse, was 180/80. According to both the American Heart Association and the United Kingdom Cardiovascular Association, that is called hypertensive crisis. Under those circumstances, the defence asks that your honours either halt these proceedings, or we waive reading of the summary and pronounce your judgment, so we can lessen the risk of further harm to Mr Mladic's health. Mr Ivetic, the doctor's advice we got is that the situation is not such that medical reasons would prevent us from continuing. Mr Mladic wants to consult with counsel, I take it? If he does it in such a way that no-one can hear your voice, and sit down, please. Mr Mladic, sit... Mr... Mr Mladic, if you could... Curtains down. Mr Mladic will be removed from the courtroom. OK. It goes on. Having summarised its findings, the chamber will now give its verdict. The chamber finds Ratko Mladic not guilty of count one, genocide. Guilty as a member of various joint criminal enterprises of the following counts. Count two, Srebrenica, genocide. Count three, persecution, a crime against humanity. Count four, extermination... The judgment, the verdict in the case of Ratko Mladic, the former general of the Bosnian Serb forces, has just been handed down. He was found guilty of ten of the 11 charges against him, on one charge of genocide he was found not guilty. The crimes committed rank among the most heinous known to humankind, and include genocide and extermination as a crime against humanity. For having committed these crimes, the chamber sentences Mr Ratko Mladic to life imprisonment. Yes. Well done. Well, guys, let's be happy for a moment. I think that's a great result. A great team effort. The word "life" keeps resonating in my head. And had there been anything but that, I would have been very angry. After that amazing long road, to hear that word... Life, life. That tells the whole story. Now I'm ready to quibble about the, er... About what? About count one. The way I understood it was it was just a substantiality away from a genocide finding. They didn't find that it met all the legal elements for genocide. But they recognised the effect of the ethnic cleansing campaign in Prijedor. Guys, many, many thanks. We are the winning team. The defence team considers this judgment to be erroneous and there will be an appeal. And we believe that the appeal will correct the errors of the trial chamber. We saw each other 5-10 minutes after the verdict. My father, he said this is all a lie. So we refuse this sentence. This is a great injustice, done to Serbian people in the first place. And my father was a symbol of this fight for freedom of Serbian people. To this day, not a single Serbian victim was protected. Nobody was ever accused of it. And you're asking Serbs whether they accept this tribunal as impartial? No, they don't. They will never do so. Over the last couple of hours, we heard a detailed reassessment of the evidence that had been heard inside this court behind me. Evidence which, at times, magnified the brutality of some of General Ratko Mladic's crimes. Mladic's crimes have now been recorded in history. During his trial, the court heard from 4,500 people who bore witness to the killings he ordered. It took a quarter of a century for their voices to be heard, for their dead to receive some justice. So, what do you think, how do you feel with the verdict? I am very happy now. Is it over? Not really. But I'm happy. Is it justice? Yes.
