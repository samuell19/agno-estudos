Stop! Stop it! Just stop it! - Agh! - No! Shoot her! Shoot her! Don't! Don't do it! Brooke! Wake the fuck up! Here. Take it. Grace... Calm down. Stay the fuck away from us. Everything's alright now, OK? She lost it, but she's fine now. Everything's gonna be alright, I promise you. Agh! No! Let 'em go. You're all monsters! You're both the fucking same. What have you done? Alright, come on. Shut up. Hey, come on. You all ready? Alpha Tango Charlie, we have a southbound vehicle approaching the 44 Lateral. Over. Roger that, Delta Zero. We have an eye in the sky monitoring the 44 Lateral in the 3-3-12. Hotel Zebra, we have a northbound two-wheeler approaching on the 23 Parallel in Sector 1-1-38. Please confirm. Roger that. Fuck! Come on, mate. Come on. Come on. Out you get. Hey! Open bunker door! Ah, Rhys! So... what's on the menu? We've got a male, early 20s. Bit banged up. Concussed, maybe. Otherwise good condition. - Bring him. - Yes, sir. On your feet. Oh, yes. Fantastic. Excellent bone structure. That's one hell of a lovely skull. - Get him inside. - Yes, sir. Good work, Rhys. Well done. You got him? Right. Right. Over there. Over here. Right. So are we any closer to the cure? Yeah, of course we are. The hybrid's been spotted, and the brother. Where? Sector 8, 100 clicks to the north. And what about these other two? Who cares? We want the freak. The hybrid. We get the girl. You get to put a bullet in that prick who killed your brother. Ugh... Cramp. Yeah. Guess it's time for me to... rehydrate. - Yep. - Off you go. Ah, just over here. Good luck out there, soldier. Now, you bring her in alive. Or you don't come knocking. You get me? Yeah. Pack of wankers. Close bunker door. We shouldn't have bloody left. She ripped my fuckin' throat out, Maxi. What the fuck are you talking about? Yeah, well whose fault was that? I'm not just gonna sit there and watch her torture some guy to death. - That guy was a soldier. - She's sick. And she's getting worse. Her and her brother. They've gone road crazy. We can't trust 'em no more. Uncle Benny trusted 'em. Uncle Benny's dead. Grace? Fuck. Here, open your mouth. Here. Here, here. Open, open! You alright? Here. Let's get going. Hi. No! No, no, no, no, no! Quiet! Oh... Access granted. Well, well, well. I told you never to bring anybody in here while I'm working. Turns out you were right, Sergeant. Looks like our Surgeon General here's a bite-hider. You fuck. - Unholster your weapon. - Yes, Colonel. Walk over there. - And blow his brains out. - Yes, sir. Just hang on a minute. Just... Just wait! You need to hide your symptoms better. Was that... ..really necessary? You ever put me in a position like that again... I'll put a bullet through your fuckin' skull. Yes, but then... ..where would you get your medicine from, Colonel? We're not going to make our serum quota this month. HQ's gonna start asking questions. Fuck HQ. And besides, once we get our hands on her... ..we won't have to worry about that anymore. Agh! Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Jesus fucking Christ. You're a hybrid. What the fuck! Open bunker door! Fuckin' idiots. It's a bit late for a barrel drop, ain't it? It's not your concern, champ. Oi! Oi! I need that fuckin' fuel for the barrel drop, you fuckin' idiots. I need you right here, Corporal. Yes, sir. What's the delivery? Female. Early 20s. She's a hybrid. Go get her now. - Yes, sir. - Yes, Colonel. Fuck! Christ! Oh, shoot her fuckin' legs out. Hey, hey, hey! Wait, wait, wait, wait. I can calm her down. I can calm her down. Keep her still. Hold still, hold still. Here you go, hon. Here you go, here you go. There you go. There you go. Easy. Easy. It's gonna be alright. I promise. - Get her inside. - Yes, sir. Oh, put it down, you fuckin' idiot. Oi. Oi! I want to know what goes on with this one. If she's a key to the cure, I want to know. You get in your truck. You drop your barrels like a good little soldier and fuck off. Close bunker door! Oh, for fuck's... Now I've run out of fuckin' fuel, haven't I? Ah, the fuck! Come on! Come on, you fuckin'... Here you go. Here you go. There you go, mate. Fuckin' eat! Nuh. Fuckin'... Come on, you fuckin' thing. Hey?

Come on, mate. Nah, fuck this. Stay still, ya fuckin' thing! There ya go. Come on, come on. Yes! I'll come back for you tomorrow, mate. Who goes there? Hey, not on me, you fuckin' peanut. Jesus Christ. I got barrels for ya. Ha! Fuckin' cop that, ya cunts! Fuck, yeah. Fuckin' pussy. You're an idiot. G'day. Is this one for the bunker? That for the boys in the bunker, is it? Righto. Barrels are in the back. Yes, sir. Dickhead. Fuck. Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait! - Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no! - Hold still! Not even gonna make it. Fuckin' hell! Fuck! Come on! Hey! Hello! Yes, yes, yes, look at this! Hey? Come on, get it! Fuck! I want you to take a deep breath in through your nose and visualise a stream of blue healing light travelling deep into your crown chakra. This energy travels down into your whole head... ..sacred healing... Oh, fuck! Fuck! Let your entire being be free from fear. and completely at peace with the universe. Whoa, easy. Easy, easy! This is where you tell me you're gonna help me get my sister back. Or I'll put this dart through your fuckin' head. Sure. Who's your sister? Me and you are going for a drive. You'll have to get that wound looked at. If you leave that you'll get septicaemia and you'll die. Yeah, right. And all I have to do is cut you loose, yeah? Listen, I'm sure there's some way we can work this out where we can both trust each other. Listen, would you... Would you mind taking your finger off that trigger there? Shut up and stitch. I'm doing it. Get your hands up. - Hands up! - They're up. Fuckin' hell. God. Start the engine. Stop. OK, off we go. We have to open the gate. Smash through it. We'll bounce straight off and you're gonna smash your face on the dashboard. Nah, that's bullshit. You just don't want to mess up your nice little gate. It's your call. Do it. Nice truck. Not talking to me, huh? Suit yourself. What's that? What does it look like? They're pills. Anti-viral pills. It's how I stay alive up here. Why have you got this? 'Cause they're terrorists. They're killers. Ain't that what you do? No, that's not what I do. I've seen the bodies. You kidnap people and you kill 'em! We don't kill anybody. - You got a package for us? - Yeah. It's the hybrid girl's sister. No shit. You've been a busy boy, Rhys. Well played, mate. - Go and get her. - Yes, sir. Fuck! Fuckin'... Hey! Hey take it easy, mate. She's a fuckin' kid. Either way, this little prick's gonna end up in a fuckin' barrel. What'd you say, mate? "Either way, she ends up in a barrel"? What the fuck does that mean? It means get in your vehicle and drive away, Corporal. Get in your vehicle. Drive away. Righto. Whoa. What the fuck just happened? Get in the truck. Fuck! Shit. Shit! - Shit! - Nitro activated. Fuck's sakes. - Power priming. - Come on! Prime! Fuckin' prime! Methane low. Replace power source. Don't worry. They don't have nitro. You sure about that? Fuckin' shit!! Wakey-wakey! Fuckin' get the dog! - Got the nuts! - Bullseye! How's that feel, slugger? Doesn't feel too good, does it, hey? Fuckin' hurts. See, traitors get the death penalty around here, Corporal. I reckon... any man who kicks another man in the balls when he's down... ..don't deserve a soldier's death. See, your brother, he died with dignity. Honour. Like a real man. But you're not a real man, are ya, hey? You're a dog. You're a lowdown, dirty dog. And you're gonna die like a fuckin' dog. You see these old boys, creeping up? They'll be here in a couple of minutes. And when they get here, they're gonna eat you from the feet up. First your feet. Then your legs. Your balls. In that order. Big tough guy like you. You could still be alive when they get to your guts. You have a good one now, eh? Well, well, well. Look what the cat's dragged in, eh? Unless I'm mistaken didn't we take care of this piece of shit already? That was my brother. Your brother? So twins? Your brother, eh? He was a fuckwit who got exactly what he deserved. I'm gonna kill ya. Nah, mate. No, the only thing you're gonna do is sit there and bleed until I fuckin' say so! You were the one that crashed their rig on the road. You gave Gracie to those butchers in the bunker. Then again... Maxi also tells me you saved her life. Still, I don't know. There's just something about ya. His face. I hate this face! That's it. The face. The face is a real problem. I just wanna rip it off and eat the fuckin' thing. What do you think, Maxi? Is this guy a friend or is he dog food? Dog food. What do you say, soldier boy? You our friend or do I bite your face off? I'm a friend, yeah. Definitely the friend. How many men in there? Five. Two out front and two with guns and a medic. - And their hardware? - Just the usual. Steyrs, shotguns, Glocks, grenades. If we get the drop on them, none of that'll matter. We'll take 'em. Oi. You cut me loose, I can guarantee that. Bit of a nasty cough. You a bit crook, are ya? Looking for these? What's in 'em? I don't fuckin' know. Give 'em to him. Ah, fuck it. Oh, you fuck! How can you do it? I didn't know. What do you mean, you didn't know? I didn't know they were killing them. I... - Bullshit. - You think I give a fuck what you think, love? - Brooke... - You knew! You all good? You reckon you can get us in there? Easy. What the...? - Intruders! - We're under attack! - We've been surrounded! - Get down! Friend of yours? I picked him up a couple of days ago. Not far from here. Now you know. What do you do with them? Down in the bunkers? We grow a curative serum inside them and then extract it. And this serum. It cures people? Not cures. Manages. It's preventative. Keeps the virus from taking hold. Listen, I have medical supplies that could last you a year. Hundreds of rounds of ammunition. Explosives. Grenades, mate. Whatever you want. Why the barrels? You should know. We grind 'em up then convert them to powder form. Pills. We make pills. Oi! Move and I'll blow his fuckin' head off! These... fucks... ..they took my soul. And so I am gonna go down into that bunker with you and we're gonna kill every last one of those sons-of-bitches. I gotta make this right. Fuckin' A. Colonel. You OK? I'm fine. You fine? Go and check the perimeter! Access granted. Ah, Colonel! Care for a toot? No? No, no. Wait! It's not that simple. You just can't suck it out of her like we do with the others. That would be like injecting rocket fuel. We have a situation upstairs, Colonel. Well, fuck me. It's taking too long. Something's wrong. No way. Give it time. Here we go. Come on! Alright, here we go. - Come on, get ready. Another one down. - Suppress your fire! Shit. Shit! Rhys. Go! Go, go, go, go! Lima Papa Zulu, we have a 187 on the 22. Requesting a link-up, over. Victor Kilo India, we have a trapped RV in the 93 Parallel. Requesting immediate choppers. You take her. I got the brother and the delivery boy. Yeah. Yeah, agreed. You start on her before I get back... ..I'll fuckin' kill ya. Oh, yeah? Like you killed Rhys? Well, forgive me if I'm not trembling in my booties. Whoa, what the fuck is this shit? Don't worry. It's a cleansing agent. It kills the virus. What's it made out of? Stay quiet. They're coming down now. She's alive. Get that door open. Fuck! Ow! - What the fuck was that? - Sorry. Oh, fuck me. Access denied. OK. G'day, boys. Drop 'em. Or I'll blow her fuckin' head off. All of 'em. Now kick 'em over. Good lads. Hey! Weak fuckin'... Ohh! This the prick who killed your brother? Thought so. Now, you see, if some dirty bastard killed my brother, I'd make sure I'd do him nice and slow. Hello, toots! Would you mind if I cracked open your skull and feasted on the juice inside? What are you up to, big guy? Huh? Don't you know that a bloke with his guts hanging on the outside should have enough sense to fuckin' die! Emergency power activated. Agh! 1138, we just came from Pill Factory 5B and it's a fuckin' slaughterhouse over there. Did you guys have any trouble in your sector today? Get your arses up here now! Don't worry about me. We need to get that door open. Brooke, you OK? Brooke? Brooke? Oh, shit, that's not good. Wait, don't shoot her. What the fuck do I do, then? Get in! Quick! Quick! Quick! Fucking hell. That cage door's not gonna hold! Give me a blood vial now. - Shit. - Come on! Shit. They're cracked. - All of 'em! - Oh, for... Fuck! So it's just blood that calms her down, right? That's right. I think I have an idea. Yeah, 'course you do. Go! Agh! Get your sister out of here. It's OK. Help me up. Fuck. Get back! You right? You fuck! Self-destruct sequence initiated. You have 30 seconds to evacuate. Get to the elevator. Access denied. Self-destruct sequence initiated. Access denied. What the fuck! You have 20 seconds to evacuate. Self-destruct sequence initiated. Self-destruct sequence initiated. What are you doing? Get in. Now! - Come on. - No! Wait. What about you? Keep her safe. You have 10 seconds to evacuate. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. Self-destruct initiated. Goodbye. Where's he taking Grace? Search the place. Find it. Fuck! What are we gonna do? Oh, yes. Hey! Hey. Come on, mate. Fuck! Yes. Look away. Ah, fuck. Here we go, mate. Brekkie time, come on. Here you go. There you go, mate. Go. Yes! Agh! Hey. You. Come and stick this up my nose. Stick it up your nose? Why? Don't you fucking question why, you dumb sonofabitch! You just take this fucking cannula and you stick it up my nose! I'll do it. OK, wait a minute. Just don't be so fucking rough. Just not too far! I fucking knew it! This guy's a bite-hider! Agh! Stay. Ah, Rhys. It actually does pain me to see you like this. And I really can't tell you... ..how much I'm gonna regret killing you. After all... ..I owe you my life! It was you, Rhys, who kept me alive... for a full year. You were such a good delivery boy. Fuck you! It's the darndest thing. You know what I can smell, Rhys? Something I never, ever thought I would smell on you, little man. Brains. I'm gonna crush your skull, scoop out your brains and eat them, delivery boy! You take 'em. And you keep taking 'em. And you're gonna help us. That's how you get your soul back.
