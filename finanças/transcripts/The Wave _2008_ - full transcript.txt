THE WAVE Making sure the kids don't smoke in the yard, huh? Hi, honey. Hey, rocker! Teachers are lazy, remember! Just doing some copying. You seen Mrs Kohlhage? No, why? She was looking for you. Better see what she wants. Autocracy? I'm teaching the anarchy class. Mr Wieland showed me his outline. It's well thought-out. - I'd have done mine this weekend. - A bit late. Wieland? Wieland doesn't have a clue about it. I studied in Berlin. I squatted in Kreuzberg for five years. May 1st demonstrations. I'm an expert. If it's that important, ask Mr Wieland to trade. Couldn't you...? Work it out between yourselves. Mr Wieland? Mr Wenger. - About the project subjects... - What? Could you trade with me? I'm doing autocracy. Alea iacta est. The die is cast. You know I wanted to do anarchy. A bit too much! Project week is for showing the students the virtues of democracy. How to make Molotov cocktails belongs in chemistry class. If at all. I loved you. You betrayed me. But I haven't forgotten my dream of life, love and trust, the dream that once was real. I will build it with my fortune by destroying you. Hey, thanks for the daisies, babe. They'll look great when I'm lying in the box. He's making a fool of himself. Know what I'm sayin', babe? "I'll take you to Capri in your coffin..." - He's saying it wrong. - It's what I want to say. Ferdi, can't we do it right through for once? You're the one who stopped. First stage rule: The show must go on! Aren't we applying the play's criticism of capitalism to today? That's why I'm updating the dialogue. OK, but don't make a joke out of it. He can't assert himself. Yeah, we're doing D?rrenmatt, not Saturday Night Live. Thank you for the wreaths, chrysanthemums and roses... dear sir! That sounds like shit. No way I'm saying that. Forget it. If Ferdi doesn't stick to his lines, I can't do it. I've had enough. Are you coming? It's a pity they're not taking it seriously. It's no use if everybody does what they want. Coming to the game today? Lisa and I have to study for Spanish. Not all afternoon? What did you sign up for? Sign up? Project week. - Are the lists up already? - Sure. - I was thinking of autocracy. - Me too. Gotta go. - Will you sign me up? - For what? - Whatever you take. - OK. See you later. I wanna see some grit. Go and dominate! Watch your defence and counter man to man. Got it? Eight minutes left. We can do it! Marco, that goes for you too. Play as a team. Let's go! Mogli, move the ball up! Nice, Marco! Marco! Sinan's wide open! - Marco! - Go for it! Sinan's free! What are you doing, damn it? Sinan was wide open! Don't you want to score? Martin, you tell me... What are we supposed to rebel against nowadays? Nothing means anything anymore. We all just want to have fun. What our generation lacks is a common goal to unite us. That'd just be the Zeitgeist. Look around. The most Googled name on the Internet is Paris Fucking Hilton! No shit. No shit. Stolte. You got the dope today? Sure I do. - This is the real thing? - Sure is. A buddy brought it from Holland. Are you nuts, carrying that much dope? Cops have to catch me first. What do you want for it? - Nothing. - What? It's free for you. You're my homeys. MONDAY Baby. The water's great. 60 degrees. Don't you want to go for a swim? It'd do you good. Maybe later. How's your shoulder? It's OK now. Don't overdo it. Yeah, sure. Coffee? Sure, thanks. Morning. What's up? - OK, Rainer? - Yeah. - Morning, Rainer. - Sinan. I have to say I'm surprised so many of you are interested in autocracy. I'd have chosen anarchy. - Lame Wieland? - Your words, not mine! So... Autocracy. What does it mean? Come on, you signed up for this topic, you must have certain expectations. No hassles, I hope. Jens, what do we mean by autocratic government? - Stuff like monarchy, I guess. - Not necessarily. Ferdi, what can you think of? Autos that are crass! That was pretty lame. - Lisa, don't let me down. - Dictatorship, maybe? That's part of it. Karo? I think autocracy is when an individual or group rules the masses. Right. Autocracy comes from the Greek and means self-rule. From auto, "self", and kratia, "power", "rule"... In an autocracy, the ruler or rulers have unlimited power to change the law as they like. Can you think of any examples? Come on, a dictatorship! - The Third Reich. - Not again. I didn't pick the topic, but we have to get through this week together. I printed out some things for you. All that stuff again? It's an important topic. The Nazis sucked. All right, we get it! And it's never gonna happen here again. What about Neo-Nazis? We can't feel guilty forever. We're not talking about guilt. It's a historical responsibility. Me a Turk, man! - OK, we all know! - What do we know? Except for some idiot East Germans... Hey, I'm from the East! You know. Skinheads. - Can't we do something else? - Like? The Bush administration. Wait, this is interesting. You think another dictatorship would be impossible in Germany? We're way beyond that. Marco, what do you think? Beats me. We'll take a ten-minute break. What's the deal? I changed the seating. Now there's more room for everyone. Fortunately, we can do whatever we want during project week. I propose we loosen things up a bit. Any objections? Very good. What are the requirements for an autocratic system? Dennis? - An ideology. - Good. What else? - Control. - Surveillance. You're getting ahead of yourselves. Unhappiness. Interesting. What does every dictatorship need? We already mentioned it. A F?hrer, man! A F?hrer? A word with lots of baggage. But every dictatorship has a central figure. Let's go through this. Who would that be here? - You, the teacher. - Me? Who else? One of you, for a change. I'll be the leader. No way! Rainer, you do it. Let's vote. Who wants me as your project leader? - What is this? - Play along. Who's against? Any nays? Abstentions? - Good. - Heil Rainer! Of course, a leader deserves respect. So you'll address me as Mr Wenger for project week. - Mr Wenger... - Is he a megalomaniac now? We just voted on it, didn't we? - East German commie! - Get with the programme! Don't tell me what to do, bitch! Watch your mouth, scumbag! Quiet! Clear off your desks. From now on, no one talks without permission. - Yes, sir! - Did I give you permission? If you want to speak, you'll stand up first. - Isn't that going a bit far? - Mona? Isn't that going a bit far, Mr Wenger? - Feel anything? - What? Standing up gets your circulation going. It's blood pressure. If you stand up, you wake up and your concentration improves. Sit down again. Marco. You're tired from training, but try sitting up straight. Straighten your spine, place your feet parallel and breathe deeply. Feel the difference? Marco. Yes, Mr Wenger. It's better. That's right, you can breathe better. Let's all do the same. Everybody get up. - Come on! - What is this? Breathe deeply. Up you get. Breathe in and out. - What's with you? - No way! Then leave, please. No one's forcing you to stay. Attendance is voluntary. - Rainer, be cool. - Mr Wenger. Kevin, it's very simple. Either play along or leave. Well? This is weirding me out. Come on, Sinan. Later daze! You can sit down again. What else is important for a dictatorship? - Discipline, Mr Wenger. - Very good, Tim. Discipline is power. Let's go shoot some pool. I've got a better idea. Dude, what's that? What happened to your M-class? It's my mom's. An anniversary present. V-8, 250 bhp, 150 mph. Wanna take this baby for a spin on the Autobahn? What's with you? - I'm not coming. - What do you mean? I'm going back. Have you totally lost it? I've already failed twice. You know what happens if I don't graduate? You're no honours student either. I'm glad you changed your mind. Have a seat in the back. Thanks... Mr Wenger. We were discussing which social conditions favour a dictatorship. Lisa? Which social conditions are necessary? Could you speak up, please? Well, like, if there's injustice. And, like, people don't know... I mean, no jobs. And stuff. Hey, Jens, what's the big idea? Lisa, have a seat. Take a deep breath. Think what you're going to say. Keep your answer short. You can do it. Try it again. OK? High unemployment and social injustice. Excellent. High unemployment and social injustice certainly would favour a dictatorship. Tim? High inflation, Mr Wenger. Good. Inflation. - Political disillusionment. - Very good, Karo. Nationalism. We saw it during the World Cup, there were German flags everywhere. But that was great! I thought it was revolting. That's what rocked about the World Cup! If Germans can't be proud of their country, like anyone else, itjust leads to the reverse, to hatred of everybody else. I think Mona means extreme nationalism. Can we agree on that? That was awesome today. Thank you. Mr Wenger? After class call me Rainer again. I really enjoyed it today. Keep up your contributions. Yes sir, Mr Wenger! Watch it! Why don't you watch it? Be nice to your sister. Just gimme a light! - You shouldn't smoke. - My dad says I can. I've got a light. Torsten just said it's up to you. None of your business, anyway. Ignore the little weirdo. - Retard! - You're the retard! Don't you have a home of your own? Hi, hon. Hi, sweetie. You thirsty, too? Aren't you going to ask me how it went? How did it go? It was totally fascinating. Mr Wenger taught us how to sit right. Upright, with your spine straight. You know when you stand up quickly and your vision goes all blurry? That's because your pulse is low. More roast? Now we have to stand up to speak. It's good for your circulation. And keep our answers to the point. Good. Why don't you, then? There was this bizarre energy. Everybody was caught up in it. "Bizarre" is right. What's that supposed to mean? "Discipline is power"... Karo, honey, that's not how we raised you. Maybe you should have. Leon could use a bit of discipline. He needs to learn his own limits. It doesn't work for everyone. Why? I kicked Kevin out of class. I'll kick your ass! Get off it! Rainer's cool. - You traitor! - I'd have kicked you out too. Besides, Rainer didn't kick you out. Mr Wenger did. He's always dissed me 'cause I'm not in his faggy water-polo team. What do you guys do there? We practise hard. I don't know why we're losing. We have to beat Ernst Barlach High, or we'll lose our league standing. Come by sometime. When's your next game? Marco, let's go to my room. We're watching the race. We can watch it in my room. We have our project assignment. - What assignment? - Are you coming? Sorry, Torsten. You go do your project assignment. Hey, my little honeybee. What say we do our own "project assignment"? I hear role-playing can be pretty stimulating. I thought we were going to do something else. Here, check this out. Here's where we'll go. The hippest part of Barcelona. Only seven stops to the soccer stadium. Isn't it a bit far? Seven stops? Barcelona. It's beautiful. Right on the sea. An artist's city. Wouldn't your family miss you? They get on my nerves. Torsten and Bine are cool. Sometimes they're too cool for me. Stop whining. Come here. I'm not in the mood. You're not moving tomorrow. What's the hurry? I have to sign up soon. Then sign up. Come on. Don't go yet. I've got practice. Wait. Not here. Come on. What the hell was that? What the hell's wrong with you? - Listen, man... - Leave me alone. Let's play together. Everyone will expect you to hog the ball. I'll swim into the clear on the left and pass back to you, OK? Get out! S?lo, you play. Nice, Marco! That's better. That was a real play. Finally! Hi, sweetie, I'm home. What's going on? I just want to print something. Those two get old real fast. A real couple of teachers. Are we like that too? What's all this for? Just a few ideas I want to try out tomorrow. I have a few ideas too! Only if you put on your nurse costume. We'll see. How about an injection? I've got an injection that's all ready to go! Really? Let's see it, then. TUESDAY Here he comes. Morning. Good morning, Mr Wenger. You're making fun of me, huh? No. Everybody stand up, please. Now do as I do. These are a few warm-up exercises to loosen up your muscles. Especially the legs. And now in unison. Left, right... What's the big idea? I want to show you something. Good. You feel it? We're becoming a single unit. That's the power of unity. - How long do we keep this up? - Until we're in step. You know that from dancing, right? Left, right... A rhythm like this can cause bridges to collapse. - Kaschi, you're out of step. - Chill, man! I think we get it, Mr Wenger. No, you don't. - This exercise has another purpose. - What's that? Wieland's anarchy class is below us. I want the plaster to fall off the ceiling onto our "enemy". Excellent! Have they gone crazy? Unity is power. You want to know why I rearranged the seating? To break up your usual cliques. You all have your friends and groups. That's important. You can't get through life all by yourself. But together, we are much, much stronger. The new seating has a method to it. Do you know what it is? Anyone? Karo, why are you sitting next to Jens and not Marco? Because Marco and I distract each other? Oh, do you? Wieland down there wants to foster his students by making them Ione warriors. You know what I mean. No one letting the other copy. I say that leads to social Darwinism. I'm convinced if we pull together, we'll be much stronger. So we can copy from each other? If it means better grades, yes. That's why I'm checking your grades, and seating the good next to the bad. I want you to help each other. That's total bull! I don't believe it. Please stand up. You wouldn't embarrass us like this. All the poor students are lined up like ducks in a row. I never said anything about poor students. Just poor grades. There are no poor students. You're good in my class, but you struggle in math. Lisa, however, is a math whiz. You can help each other. And there's another advantage. The whole class would do better. Better than the anarchists downstairs. I know it's unorthodox. But why not try something new? Hey, Tommy. Pretty loud, huh? How's it going with Wieland, our Bavarian? I thought anarchy would be interesting. But he just blows. He's such a jerk. If you guys hadn't raised hell, I would've dozed off. What was that? A little calisthenics to wake them up. Calisthenics? I thought the building was going to collapse. My students are outraged, and justly so. Can I help you kids? We wanted to ask if we can switch to the autocracy group. Right away, if possible. We were talking about group unity. What are the signs of group unity? Team spirit, Mr Wenger. Good. But I meant visual signs. - Dress, Mr Wenger? - Correct. A common way of dressing. Uniformity, you could say. Uniforms suck. Dominik? I mean, uniforms are totally fascist. Not necessarily military uniforms. There are all kinds: McDonald's, stewardesses, meter maids... Even business suits are a dress code. Your outfit is a kind of uniform too. It indicates your social group. Lisa? Uniforms can serve another purpose. They eliminate social differences. But they eliminate individuality too. Mona, would you stand up, please? Lisa, would you explain that to us? Well, I mean, we all stress out every morning over what to wear. If we all wore a uniform, we wouldn't have to. In Hamburg they're talking about reintroducing school uniforms. Does that make sense? Sure, but they'd have to be cheap enough for everyone to afford. Marco, why don't you tell everybody? I was saying... The Knicks' Stephon Marbury developed a basketball shoe that costs $14.98, the "Starbury One". He's a ghetto kid and wanted a shoe kids could afford, instead of expensive Nike Airs. A good example. How can he market them so cheaply? Because they're made in Chinese prison camps. No, they just do without expensive ad campaigns. Nike spends hundreds of millions on ads. David Beckham got 80 million from Adidas. What say we adopt a school uniform for the duration of project week? Like what? A pair ofjeans, a white shirt. Everyone has that. - I don't have a white shirt. - Then buy one. I'm not spending money for that. Come on, how much can it cost? Jens, stand up, please. I've got two. You can have one of mine. That's what I call team spirit! Good for you! It's decided, then. - Two of the same? - Right. You already bought one. That'll be 110 euros. Thank you. - Receipt? - Don't worry about it. These must really be hip. That'll be 45, please. Excuse me, but my things may be in here, too. Where are you going in that? Why? You look like a nun. Well, I like it. Where's your white shirt? WEDNESDAY I didn't like it. - Why not? - I just don't look good in white. So that's it. Pure vanity again. I don't have to explain why I don't want to wear a dumb shirt! That's just what Mr Wenger was talking about. Pure egoism. Karo, we agreed. Mind your own business! She doesn't look good in white. Good morning. Mona has switched classes. More newcomers. We're definitely full now. Go ahead and find a seat. Jules and Frederik wanted to join us too. Full means full. Now that we're so many, we need a name, don't we? Excellent. That was my next topic. Any suggestions? Terror Squad. Serious suggestions only. Visionary Club. - The Wave. - You would say that! It's great. It fits. True. Tim? Tsunami. That's overdoing it. The Base. The Pact. The White Giant. The Inner Circle. The Risen. - The Centre. - That's good too. Anyone else? No one? The Changers. The Changers? That's quite a few. I'll write some down. OK, last suggestion... The Changers. We have a winner. From now on we are The Wave. That's really good. Helps me concentrate. Honest. I like it. Why not design a logo for us? - For real? - Yes. You design our logo. That brings us to the next step. Action is power. What's the use of great ideas if we don't actually do something? I want everyone to contribute to The Wave, for the greater good. I'll set up a profile on MySpace for us. Great. - I wanted to do that. - Do it together. No. I'd rather do something on my own. Why don't you make a website? We can make buttons with the logo. My aunt has a machine. We could have tattoos. On our arms. Postcards to hand out... Hey, what's up? A friend of mine is out of stash. I heard you can get dope. Hey, my money's good. Go buy it on the street. What's going down over there? They're shaking down Stoltefuss. I don't sell dope to anarchist freaks. What's that mean? Check out his pretty shirt. Mommy buy it for you? Leave me alone, you fucks! Hey, take it easy. Everything's cool. Is there a problem here? - Two more weirdoes. - What? This a gang thing? If you hassle Tim, we'll kick your ass. All right. Fucking fascists. Those anarchist freaks tore my shirt. Don't let those scumbags push you around. - You got my back. - If we're not here? Tim, listen, let me give you my number. If those fags hassle you, you gimme a call, OK? Sure. What was that earlier? I don't know, she's angry about something. I can't get through to her. I've noticed that too, recently. It bothers me when she tells me what to do. She makes plans without bothering to ask me. Why should I even follow her to Spain? Ten months from now she'll have some guy named Juan or Miguel or whatever. I'm scared I'll lose her. Karo, this is Dennis. Where are you? It's total chaos. Call me back when you get this message, OK? - Voicemail. - Like I said. But she knows we're rehearsing today. No big loss. I bet she's pissed off because nobody voted for "The Changers". I'm not sitting around all day waiting for our little princess. I'm with you. Hey, wait a minute. Lisa, I'm going too. If you leave now, we can bag the play! Is that what you want? I think we can produce something really great. A play that means something. Notjust entertainment, but a message. But not without Karo. You wanted her to play the lead. I was against that consensus rule. I thought we should have real auditions. We never really voted on it, anyway. Could you all be quiet for a moment? Let's do it the way I say. Just once. Your big break, Maja. You're Claire Zachanassian. Cool. - And Lisa, you play Maja's role. - Me? Sure. You know the part. Just go for it. And Ferdi, stick to the text and don't clown around for once, OK? Man, I'm glad that day's over. Rainer was doing cool stuff with us. You should join up again. The Wave needs you, man. How will that look? You don't have to come to class. You can still join. Hey, let us have a go! - What do you want? - To skate! You're that bitch Karo's brother. - Got a problem with that? - She's a cunt. So what else is new? The pipe belongs to The Wave. You want to skate, you have to join. ... sits /n the forest for the /ast time, fu// of cuckoos and how//ng winds. Tonight, the congregation w/// assembie. Dennis said I was really good. And now Maja has my role? Well, it was just to try it out. Where were you? I wasn't feeling good. And Ferdi's sticking to the text? Dennis finally put his foot down. You're all against me, in your white shirts. - Bull! - But it's working now! Just because we voted against your name. Excuse me? You rub people up the wrong way. Are you nuts? Has it ever occurred to you Marco may not want to go to Spain? - Why do you say that? - He told me. What else did he tell you? How often we make it? You suck, you know that? I suck? What if I talked to your boyfriend like that? I don't have a boyfriend. In case you hadn't noticed. It's all about you. You know what? Maja was much better than you. But you don't care about that. You're pissed off because you're not top dog in The Wave. A shitty feeling, isn't it? Get used to it! Hi. I want to show you something. Look. Here. - What is it? - Know what a slacker Kaschi is? He made us a MySpace page. Cool, huh! Way cool! - Honey. - Yes? Kaschi's totally psyched. The kids are changing. Sure, like all wearing white shirts! OK, I forgot to change. The faculty are talking about you. Haven't they always? Since when do you care? I'm just saying. - That's our sign. - Cool. We'll roll over the town like a wave. That looks rad on a wall! My respect. What's he doing here? What's your problem, retard? Be glad you're in. Peace, guys. Anyone can join The Wave who believes in the cause. Tim's right. Kevin bailed. Why the change of mind? Chill! Kevin had 5,000 stickers printed. That shows he's worthy. Sure, sponsored by daddy. I think Mr Wenger should decide if he can join or not. Mr Wenger taught us about unity. United we stand. I bet your Mr Wenger wouldn't like us tagging the whole town. You're getting too uptight. I thought we were here to have fun. Well? OK, grab the stuff and let's go. Everyone got stickers? What's going on? Hey, guys! What's wrong, retard? Cover up the anarchy clowns' scribbles. Righteous! Don't worry about it. She could have come along. - Speak of the devil. - Leave it. You're uncool if you're always available. Trust me. I'm a girl, I know how we think. This is wicked! Know what would rock? Spraying The Wave up there. How cool would that be? Let's bail! I'll do it. What? I'll climb up there. Stop fucking around. Forget it, man. Give me your phone. - Got video? - Yeah. This guy is so whacked. He filmed his sister getting laid. - He doesn't have a sister. - What? I know Stoltefuss from way back, from camp. Got paralytic the first night. He's got a big brother, a computer geek at university. But no sister. Tim! Don't fuck up! Shit, it's the cops! THURSDAY Mom. Of all the nerve! I'd never have climbed up there. I wet my pants on the diving board. Heights don't freak me out. Here, guys. Thanks. Nope. Wave members only. What? Just kidding. Go ahead. Stick it where the sun don't shine. I'm in. You know what the initiation is, right? Don't listen to the retard. Hey, Turk, you got a big mouth in your white shirt. Hey, what you think of this? A real mellow Wave salute. Real chill. As our salute? All groups have their own salute. Like Black Power. - West Coast. - East Coast, gangsta! Eminem. No, this is Eminem. - Hang loose. - Or Satan. Don't forget the Vulcans. OK, great. How did it go? Like this? - Don't go up at the end. - Lower down. OK, all together now. Good morning. Good morning, Mr Wenger. Be seated. Our last point was "action is power"... - We won't let you in. - Why not? Because you're not in The Wave. Leon! What's going on? They won't let me through. What's the big idea? Not without the salute. What salute? Morning, Mr Wenger. Can I have a word? Karo, I've missed you in class. - Do you have a minute? - Sure. So what did you do? I gave him hell. I'll have a word with your brother. - And what about The Wave? - What about it? Are you just going to keep on with it? You'd give up that easily? One more day. We'll see it through together. Without a white shirt, for all I care. Sorry, Rainer, but I think it's totally out of control. I guess you'll have to switch classes, then. You OK? How're things here? I didn't think you cared. Mr Wenger, can I have a word? In my office. Sure. Dr Kohlhage, believe me, I have an educational goal. You should see how the students have developed. I know that. I just wanted to tell you Mr Westerhoff called. Jens is totally transformed. He was thrilled. I didn't want to say it in the faculty room. Some of your colleagues have a hard time with your style. But you have my support. Keep up the good work. The next edition of The Scraw/ is laid out. There's no room. It'd take too long, anyway. Give me everyone's e-mail address. We can't. Privacy! Oh, who cares? I'll help you. Know what I think? I think you're going overboard. You wanna sit around and do nothing? No, I wanna go to Kaschi's LAN party. LAN party. Whee! Don't lose them, I had to sign for them. What do you say, meet by the lake at eight? Too early, say nine. It's only project week, after all. Are you fucked in the head? - Are these the guys? - Yeah. So you're The Wave Nazis? Wave Nazis? Are you full of shit? You're being brainwashed. Piss off! You painted over our graffiti. What are you talking about, faggot? Tim, are you crazy? Be cool, man! Run or I'll blow your brains out. OK. OK. They're gone. Put the gun away. Are you crazy? You can't go around packing heat. It only fires blanks. Calm down. Got it off the Internet. Simple as that. The end justifies the means. It's not true that they beat up the kid. We want to stir people up, don't we? I'm sticking with the truth. Then we might as well forget it. Yes? I've been looking for you. - What are you up to? - Nothing. We're having a party by the lake. Wanna come? We? You mean The Wave members. There'll be a few others too. No, thanks. I won't feel welcome without a white shirt. That's just stupid. Yes, it is stupid! That's why I'm not coming. Bad vibes! I better go. - You can stay. - I have to go to Glee Club. Have fun at the party. Bye. - What you got against The Wave? - Marco, open your eyes! It's turning into this really weird thing. You're overreacting. Oh, yeah? Look at this, then. Look at that. Yeah, Tim made it. He tends to overdo it. Here..."Yesterday a guy in a white shirt hassled me. "If I don'tjoin The Wave I'll have no friends. "They're all joining! "I said I'll think about it and he got nasty, "saying it might be too late." Too late for what, Marco? Don't you see? Students are being harassed. That thread was posted anonymously. - Could be a fake. - A fake? Leon hassled a little kid because he wouldn't do your dumb salute. - Your brother always was a retard. - Not that bad. And I'm treated like a leper because I don't wear a white shirt. Then why notjust wear one? Because I don't want to. But I do. - The Wave means a lot to me. - Like what? Community. You know about that, you have a healthy family. I don't. Are you coming? Can I help you? - What are you doing here? - Protection. - What? - I'm your bodyguard. What for? Tim, go home. What do I want at home? They don't care about me. Come to me if you have problems, but I don't need a bodyguard. Come on. Hi, hon. What did Mrs Kohlhage want? - Hello, Tim. - Hello, Mrs Wenger. - Rainer, can I have a word? - Sure. What's going on? I didn't invite him, he just showed up. He's got nobody at home. I had other plans too. We'll have dinner, then send him home. Do you have any ginger? That goes really well. Way cool here. Like I say. Say, what is up with Karo? Why? She came to the newspaper, totally stressing out. About The Wave? She wanted the mailing list to send out e-mails. No way. Seriously? Yeah. No way! EMAIL SEND INTERRUPTED NO LAN-CONNECTION Shit! First we thought about Paris, and then Lake Balaton. But Italy would be way cooler. Good food, cute girls... What more could you want? Why don't you come? As guardian. We'll see, Tim. Tuscany. It'd be cool! It's not Rainer's decision. All the students would be for it. If not, we'll sign a petition. This has been a nice evening, Tim. But Anke and I would like some time by ourselves now. Sure thing. OK, Tim? See you tomorrow. Heard about the "six wanderers"? No. My dad says that here where the great lakes meet, there're still a half-dozen drowned corpses floating around. Divers see them and think they're recent, until they notice they're wearing 1980s clothes. Most of them committed suicide, and the weird thing is, the current keeps returning them to the spot they died. As if they're looking for redemption. The fishermen call them the six wanderers. Got it. - May I? - Sure. - OK? - Yeah. Cheers. Beautiful here, isn't it? I never want to leave. Who says you should leave? Just the way it is. Go away to college after graduation. I don't even know what to study. I could see myself getting a regularjob, marrying the right girl, having two or three kids and living my life in some town house. Does that sound stupid? Not at all. Turn down the music and come here. You back there too. Come here. Where's Marco? Marco! Get over here! What is it? Come here. First of all... This is cool, you all showing up! Itjust rocks. And second, tomorrow is our big game against the retards from Ernst Barlach High. You all gotta come. It'd rock even harder if you all came to support us. So, tomorrow, 3pm at the pool. You guys rock. Bring everybody you know, in a white shirt! Everybody! Our enemies will feel the power of The Wave! - The Wave! - Now party on! FRIDAY WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THIS SYMBOL? Good morning, Mr Wenger. Tim, what is up with you? You can't stay out all night. Do you realise the position you're putting me in? Shit! That was those goddamn anarchists. Now do you believe you need protection? Hey, are you crazy? Yeah, calm down. - We got 'em all. - Good. I think we all know who's behind this smear campaign. We've no proof. Marco, excuse me? You want The Wave to go on too, right? Sure. I'll talk to her. But after the game. What should we do with all the flyers? Destroy them. What the...? I don't know who did it! I don't want to know, but it was a dangerous stunt. I screwed up in my day too, believe me. But this is going too far. Got it? Yes, sir. Sit down. Write down your experiences with The Wave over the past week, and put them on my desk at the end of class. Get started. Time's up. See you later, Mr Wenger. This doesn't mean I wouldn't appreciate seeing you at the game. We need your support. I know who's responsible for the graffiti on the town hall. Did I ask you to tell me who did it? I don't want to know. If I did, I'd have to inform the principal and the police. It's called vandalism. If you've learnt one thing this week, it's the value of sticking together. You of all people should take that to heart. I'll be pleased to see you at the game today. OK? OK. - I can't let you in. - Why not? Get a shirt from outside. But I don't want a stupid shirt! Don't make a scene. You're full of shit! The right side is reserved for us. You've all gone crazy. Move the ball up! Go! Excellent! - What do you say now? - Shut your face! Now what? I'm not giving up that easily. Don't let up! You're ahead! Piss off, man! Retard! - Ready? - Yeah. Stop The Wave! Stop The Wave! Had to be them. Bring them all to me. You're sick, go home! Hey, sit down! What's your problem? What's going on? Are you nuts? What's wrong with you? What are you doing? Sinan, what's wrong with you? Shit! I just don't believe it. You got them on this trip. Was it my idea for them to start a brawl? - Of course not. - What do you mean, then? You relish the way they hang on your every word. Are you telling me you wouldn't? You're a teacher too. That's not the point. They look up to you, but you're manipulating them. It's an ego trip. Don't you see that? I think you're jealous. - What? - Because they don't look up to you. This minor-league teacher is showing you up. You think that's the problem? It's what you all think. Because of my college. Physical education and political science! - I never knew the wound was so deep. - Oh, you didn't? At least I don't pop pills every Monday because I'm scared of going to school. Anke. Anke, wait... - I didn't mean that. - You did. You said it and you meant it. You've turned into an asshole. Leave me alone. Shit! Karo, what was that back there? You can't do that! You think you're some kind of resistance fighter? What's up with you? What was the deal at the game? - It was full for the first time. - And the fight? That was because of this! You just don't get it, do you? We'd have won if not for you. That bugs you. For once it was my show today. You moron. - Leave me alone. - Don't walk away! Let go of me! Let go of me! Get lost! Marco, what are you doing here? I screwed up. Come on in. What happened? I hit Karo. You did what? - I hit Karo. - Why? I don't know. We had a fight about... This whole shit has totally changed me. I love Karo. But I still hit her. All this pseudo-discipline, it's totally fascist. You have to stop it. Rainer? I'll think of something. You have to call it off. Now! Don't tell me what to do. Yes, Dr Kohlhage, I know that. I won't downplay the seriousness of it. I take full responsibility. But I must speak to the students. All I'm asking is for you to trust me on this. Hey, guys! "Auditorium, 12 tomorrow. The Wave's future is at stake..." "Pass it on to members and supporters." Three exclamation marks! SATURDAY Mr Wenger. It's quarter after 12. Lock the doors. I don't want any interruptions. Yes, sir. I'd like to stay standing up here, so I have a clear view of the room. Go ahead. All clear here? Then lock the doors. Mr Wenger doesn't want any interruptions. Everyone inside! "I always had everything I wanted: clothes, money, whatever. "But what I had most of was boredom." That's mine. "But the last few days have been really fun. "It doesn't matter who's the best-Iooking, "most popular or successful. "The Wave has made us all equal." "Race, religion and class don't matter anymore. "We all belong to a movement. "The Wave gives our lives meaning, "ideals worth standing up for." "I used to bully other kids. "But the more I think about it, the lamer it seems. "It's much better to be part of a good cause." "If we all rely on each other, we can accomplish so much more, "even if it means personal sacrifices." As you surely noticed, they were excerpts from your essays about the past week. It's impressive, what you got out of The Wave. We shouldn'tjust allow our project to end. Rainer, what the hell? Marco, sit down! Yes, but... People think... I said sit down! Germany's been going downhill for years. We're the losers of globalisation. The politicians want us to believe the only solution is to work harder. But the politicians are puppets for big business. They say unemployment's falling, and we're still the world's export champions. But in reality, the poor are getting poorer and the rich, richer. Our greatest threat is terror. A terror we unleashed ourselves. Because of the injustice we permit in the world. And while we slowly destroy our planet, a few of the superwealthy rub their hands and build themselves spaceships so they can watch from above. Don't you see what he's doing? He's manipulating you. Marco, sit down! You can't stop me speaking the truth. The Wave is the real problem! No. The Wave is the only answer. Together, we can do anything. We... We have the opportunity to make history. Your girlfriend riled you up against us. - That's your problem. - That's not true! It must be. She infected you with her attitude. But you can't stop us. The Wave will roll over all of Germany! Anyone who opposes us will be bowled over by The Wave! Right on! Bring that traitor up here! Marco, I'll ask you in front of everyone. Are you with us or against us? Are you totally crazy? What should we do with the traitor? What should we do with the traitor? Bomber, tell us! Well? You helped drag him up here. Because you said so. Because I said so? Would you kill him if I said so? Should we hang him or cut his head off? We could torture him first, so he agrees to our rules. That's what they do in dictatorships. Do you understand what happened here? You all right, Marco? Yeah, sure. Do you remember the question at the beginning of the week? Would a dictatorship be possible again in Germany? That's what happened here. Fascism. We thought we were special. Better than the rest. And what's worse, we excluded others who didn't agree with us. We hurt them... I don't want to think what we might have been capable of. I owe you all an apology. We went too far. I went too far. But now it's over. What's this mean? For The Wave? It's over. Just like that? Yes. Just like that. No, it's not over. Yes, it's over. Not everything about The Wave was bad. We felt it. We made mistakes, but we can fix that. No, Dennis. That kind of thing can't be fixed. I want you all to go home now. I'm sure you have a lot to think about. Thanks. - Maja... - Leave me alone. Stop! The doors stay shut! Nobody goes home! Put it down. You lied to us. The Wave lives. It isn't dead. Say it. The Wave lives! It only fires blanks. Now you take me seriously, huh? I know you were fucking with me. You all were! The Wave... was my life. Calm down. Calm down. Put the gun down. Come another step closer and I'll shoot you in the face. And then what? And then what? There'll be no Mr Wenger. No one to lead The Wave. Is that what you want? Karo, come here.
