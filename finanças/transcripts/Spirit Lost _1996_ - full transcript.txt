HE DOESN'T EAT OR SLEEP FOR DAYS ON END. AND YOU SHOULD SEE WHAT HE'S PAINTING. MAYBE HE SHOULD TALK TO SOMEONE. MARK AND I HAVE A FRIEND. HE'S A WONDERFUL PSYCHOLOGIST. HE'S NOT GONNA GO.

I DON'T KNOW. YOU TELL ME. I SEE THE GHOST AS A CONSTRUCT OF YOUR FEARS AND APPREHENSIONS... ABOUT WHERE YOU ARE IN YOUR LIFE RIGHT NOW. YOU DON'T KNOW A DAMN THING ABOUT ME. I KNOW WHAT I SEE. I SEE A MAN WHO IS AFRAID TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEMS... IN HIS RELATIONSHIP AND HIS CAREER CHOICES. AND SO HE'S MANIFESTED REASONS TO HAVE AN AFFAIR WITH A FICTITIOUS WOMAN. JOHN. THE MIND IS A POWERFUL TOOL. IF YOU THINK ABOUT SOMETHING LONG ENOUGH, YOU CAN MAKE IT REAL. SHE IS REAL. SHE IS A DISTRACTION. NOW UNTIL YOU ARE HONEST WITH YOURSELF, YOU WILL ALWAYS BE POSSESSED. COULD WE STOP HERE ? I MEAN, JUST LET ME THINK ABOUT SOME THINGS, OKAY ? I GOTTA GO. BUT, JOHN, I THINK YOU SHOULD CONTINUE WITH THIS THERAPY. YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANT, I CAN RECOMMEND SOMEBODY IN YOUR OWN AREA. I'LL THINK ABOUT IT. HE MADE ME FEEL LIKE I'M SO AFRAID OF MY OWN LIFE, I GOTTA SCREW A GHOST TO MAKE ME FEEL LIKE A MAN.

I FOUND OUT THAT THE ORIGINAL HOUSE WAS BUILT BY THE SEA CAPTAIN... OF A SHIP CALLED THE JAMAICAN TRADER, ABOUT 200 YEARS AGO. THE NAME PLANK ? THAT'S RIGHT. SUPERSTITION HAS IT THAT THE SPIRIT OF HIS WIDOW CAME BACK TO HAUNT THE PLACE. STILL LOOKING FOR HER HUSBAND, I SUPPOSE. WHY DIDN'T SOMEONE TELL ME ABOUT THIS BEFORE I BOUGHT THE HOUSE ? WELL, IT AIN'T EXACTLY THE SORT OF THING YOU PUT IN A REAL ESTATE BROCHURE. AND BESIDES, IT'S JUST A GOOD TALE FOR A RAINY DAY. I NEED MORE INFORMATION. WELL, UM, TRY THOSE BOOKS OVER THERE. THERE ARE A FEW ON LOCAL HISTORY IN THERE. THEY'RE FROM AN ESTATE SALE. I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO GO THROUGH THEM YET. BUT, UH, YOU MIGHT SOMETHING. LET ME KNOW. WHAT'S WRONG, HONEY CHILD ? YOU LOOK SO TROUBLED. I'VE SEEN BETTER DAYS. WELL, DON'T YOU FRET, NOT ONE BIT. DO YOU HEAR ME ? YOU KNOW, THINGS HAVE A WAY OF WORKING OUT. TAKE THIS. AND MAY GOD BLESS YOU.
