- Our story starts hundreds of years ago when the only daughter of an 18th-century aristocratic family, who was betrothed to Javanese royalty, renounced everything. Her title, her riches, much to her family's displeasure. She was Marshanda Damayanti, the princess pirate. She fled a life of confinement to live unchained and unfettered, plundering the South China Sea, where she formed a new family, a loyal crew of women she saved from the shackles of servitude or title. it was on the high seas she forged a friendship with a notorious pirate, Red Cat Morgan. Together, they ruled the waves, becoming each other's only true ally, but their past was never far behind. Victims of their ravage, hell bent on tracking them down, wanting retribution in blood. When her pursuers eventually closed in, Marshanda entrusted her share of the riches to Red, who in turn gave her a wrist device that would lead her back to Red and the treasure. She then headed towards the frozen waters of the Antarctic, so desperate to escape that she went somewhere no one would dare follow. But tragically, her ship was lost to the ice, lost for hundreds of years until now. - Up here, Stuart, we have one of those homeless again. Get Mr. Walsh down here immediately. - Hey! - Get her out of here! Get the boss! Get Mr Walsh! - Daddy, she's hungry, catch. - She did not pay for that spring roll. Tase her, Gary. - Mia, Mia. Mia. Those toilets is blocked again, and I've got a big meeting with this finance tosser Collins. He's in the bar waiting right now and the timing's terrible. You know, sometimes I think it's a sign. You know, sometimes I think you want me to lose this bar. Hmm? - Fine, I'll do it, give it here. - Oh, I love the way you unblock a toilet. - Ew. Sorry, sorry. What is, I don't speak, I'm really sorry, listen, I don't, I'm from Croydon. Do you know Croydon? You're hiding from someone, is that it? It's going to be okay. - Excuse me. Did you see a woman run through this way just now? - A lady in the medical gown? - Yes. - Yeah, she shoved me and went that way. She just left, you might still be able to catch her. - Thank you, Thank you. Police! - That was so exciting, I've never lied to the police before. Oh crap, are you an escaped killer on a violent rampage? Oh, let's just get you inside. There's food inside, food. I have an idea. Here, take this. Catch. Wait, wait, no, no, no, no, I promise, wait, wait. More, good, good, look, mmm, mmm, good. Oh, no, no, don't, don't. You want another one, you got it, that's it. This guy, he didn't do anything, just gave vague promises. Hey, it's okay. Time to distract Eddie. Eddie! - Where you been? The toilets are blocked, don't worry about it. Oh, careful, oh my God, Eddie, come on. - State of that shitty bar, make it yourself, did ya? - Yeah, I like it, too. It's Skip's great, great, no, great, great, great, great, great, great grandfather had a commission or something. You all right, Benny? - Mia, can I trouble you for another? - Yeah, of course. Hey, how's sick leave going? Oh, you know, another day on the right side of the grass and oh, lovely, let me keep the box. - Very nice, fair do's hey, the usual? - Oh, yes, please. Eddie made me something called discharge of the light brigade, ugh. - No worries, leave it with me. - We need to get you unhooked from this taser. This is gonna suck, but, hey. I'm sorry, I think I understood that and I'm really, really, I'm really sorry, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, bear with. I'm so sorry, bear with, bear with, breathe. Let's get you into something a little less conspicuous. Looks good. Let's see. It's amazing what people leave behind in pubs after a few pints, honestly. These look like they'll fit, so try these on. Okay, let's get you some real food, all right. What do you fancy, scampi fries, beef crisps? Are you vegetarian, because that's all we have? Right, you might be a mass murderer and I'm here asking about your dietary requirements. I'm an idiot, okay, please stay, all right, I'll be right back. - Hey, hey, ready yourselves for another delightful concoction from London's greatest mixologist. I call this one , angel jizz. - Welcome explorers to the Smugglers Tavern, the pirate's private party palace. This is the most historically infamous sordid den of villainy and underworld chicanery that ever was in old London town. And it's here our walking tour of London shall pause for refreshments and use of the facilities. Mine's a Brandy Alexander if anyone's buying. No? No? Fair enough. - Argh, froze banana, bone sack. - I need to talk to step to Skip about our deal. - He's busy. - Just get him. - I just said he's busy. - Please. - I'm not selling. - Mr. Walsh is offering-- - I'm not selling! - I know it's been in your family for generations, but you need to think about-- - I will not change my mind. - Fine, Mr. Walsh won't be happy. - Hey, look, I know you're really doing everything you can to help out, but is there anything you can do to just help out a little bit more? - Well, if he doesn't pay any of you this month, he might just scrape by, but what about next month? Hey, don't worry. You can always be a barmaid somewhere else. It's not the only pub in London. - Eddie will be with you shortly. - Skip is missing his cue. - He's in the middle of something. - Shit, here, tell this lovely girl, - Woman. - Woman, about the dastardly dealings of the Smugglers Tavern. - We do two for one cocktails between now and six. - Nice. - Cocktails. - Actually, let me go find this general knowledge expert who knows a lot more than I do. - Lots of the legends here are true, it's a most mysterious place this. Before the great fire, it was 1666, lots of nefarious stuff, and right here, I mean this bar, it's built right on top of the lost rivers and caves of London, all lost when they rebuilt post-fire apparently. - To reach your destination, you must leave the shore. - Ah, yes, the maxim of ferocious pirate Catherine Morgan, or Red Cat, as she was known. - Oh yeah, because she had nine lives, - Cat discovered a baby kraken orphaned from its mother. She cared for this krakling, naming her Lucy, a fierce protector of the pirate who raised her. Red Cat spent years trying to find a friend, eventually Cat turned up here. Her last hope was that her friend would follow in her footsteps to the infamous Smugglers Tavern, known as a black market for trading pillaged riches. Allegedly, she left a trail of clues should Marshanda return to claim her share before Cat herself became nothing more than legend. The man being shot by Red Cat in the painting bears a likeness to Skip's forefather who owned the tavern at the time, leading many to believe Skip's family were more involved in the sordid deeds of this notorious pirate than we know. - Cool, I'll take two of those cocktails please. - Kraken, it's a nice touch. - I actually love the kraken. - I hope you enjoy daylong sci-fi sessions with an unwashed flacid ape man. He feeds off self-esteem, this one, so I'd look out for that, yeah. - Hey, Eddie, can you pass me a water? - Hey, check this out. See this fool over there? So she used to date him and it looks like they've dragged new dates to the same place. - Why don't you kick this date into phase two and just shit off to Nando's. - You shit off to Nando's, you ponce. - Eddie, the water. Thank you. - Oh, hey, They've called down, delivery's waiting, been up there for about 10 minutes. - 10 minute, ugh. You can stick your apology. Hey, well done, another delivery's been nicked. This one's on you, Eddie. - Come on, don't be like that, Mia. Skip, Eddie did not-- - Run, Mia, run! - Are you all right down there, Skip? - I think so. - Call an ambulance, Eddie. Hey, don't kill him, don't. - Ya. Ya. That was the same crest as the restaurant next door. Hey, what does this mean? - Her vocal sound obliterated, that's not healthy. Sounds like you've been doing eight Phantoms a week. That's serious. I can fix this. - Skip! - Oh, hey, you can't be back here. - Yep, just knocking together a cheeky vocal tonic. - Eddie, they cut the landline before roughing me up. That's another thing I, ow, to pay for. Oh yeah? See, if I was 15 years younger, I'd throw you about like an empty track suit. - What's this? - Gun powder and this is why you can't be back here. - All right. - Hey, you're a bright bulb, maybe you can communicate with her, what's she saying? - I'll see what I can do. - Wanna get some ice on that. There's no signal down here. - I know. - Right, I'll go up and call the police. - I don't think the police can help her. What is she looking for? Hey, who were those guys? - Just some people who want to cash in on Mummy's fortune. I can't even afford to keep the lights on and they can smell the blood in the water. So I'm gonna have to sell. I let my father down. - I can help you, I've been saving up. - Oh, Mia, no, I can't do that again. - Yes, please, yes you can. It's fine, you can owe me. - I can't. - Skip, please, it's fine. - Mia, no. It's only a bar. - It's a home. - I can't. I can't. - It's not up to you. I'm gonna help you. I won't be needing this anytime soon. So much for traveling the world. Come on, you. - Okay, let's see how get this translation app is. You're welcome. Language not recognized. - See if you can translate. - Do your thing. Who are you? - Marshanda Damayanti. - Marshanda? - Marshanda. - I'm Mia. Mia. - Mia. - Yes, Mia. Marshanda. - Sod this shithole, ladies to champers. - The police are on their way. Danger. - Danger. - Hey, police are gonna be here in a little bit. And I don't want my friend to get in trouble. Can she come with you just for a short while? I'll come find her and drinks will be on me. - Abso-bloody-lutely. - Tell her that she needs to go and I'll come find her then. - Go. - She'll be safe with us. - None of you saw her, especially you. - I'm not supposed to go anywhere until the police. I will buy you shots. I will get you to, stop, they're surprisingly strong. - Oh, no, no, no, go, go. - Go on then. I can't. I can't leave them. No, wait, what you doing? - Did you call the police? - Yes, yes, I did. And they are coming to take statements so everyone needs to stay here. - What about the ambulance? - Yeah, ambulance too. - We can't have the police coming here. - Huh, why not? - Marshanda, she might be running from something, I think. - For what? - What is she looking for? - Look, why is she looking? - I don't know, until I figure that one out, let's maybe not throw her under the bus, all right. The thing on the wrist, this crest, what is it? That crest is ancient and it's been in that building upstairs long before it was a restaurant. They've been trying to buy me out and they'll try anything to burn me. Look, I'm sorry, but keep this quiet, they've put a bid in for this place. It's three times what the place is worth. Maybe she's involved with them. - No, no. She's not with them. - Then keep her out of sight. - What makes you think this is going well, I don't-- - No, no, no, absolutely. We'll just, we'll start again. Me and Chloe. - Get your mucky hands off of me. - No, no, the police said not to leave. Help me out. Mia, help me out. Hello, Matt. - Mr. Walsh, fancy seeing you here. - This is DC Cross, been a bit of a disturbance in the area. I just wanted to check our lovely neighbors were all right. - Go, go, there. In here, go, in here, stay, you stay. No, no, you gotta stay and hide. We need to keep you out of sight. - Well, it looks like our suspect committed similar acts on your premises. - Yo, Skip, who is this guy? - Theodore Walsh. He inherited the restaurant from his father and also acquired his lust for this place. - Call me Ted, actually no, Mr. Walsh. My associate believes our suspect is here, my niece. - Your niece? - We are just concerned. - Well, maybe we should just wait for the police, eh, sort this all out. - But we are the police anyway. - You got any id? Isn't that how you do things here? - Come here. Look at my face. This is all the ID you need. Take a good long look. There we go. - So your niece? - Yes, hospital gown, violent, quite the character, a troubled young woman, I have to say. We were in the process of getting her some assistance, psychiatric assistance. She had an episode, ran away, millennials. - Your niece, you're her uncle? - Yes. - And this lot? They're your task force? - Uncle. - We're also uncle. - Also uncle. - Big family. - More police are on the way. - Are they? - We were just trying to leave. - Hi, we have a schedule to keep. - Hey, don't touch me. - Relax. Let's all have some drinks, that's why we're here, right? All we need is the woman. Where is she? - She was here, Mr. Walsh. I don't know where she is currently. - Whoops. I'll get those up. Let's try again. - Well, look who it is. Come on, darling. - Why were you hiding in there? - Mia, these men are dangerous. - No, stop. - See. - Wait, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Mister, I'm not who you're looking for. - Mr. Walsh. Mr. Walsh, I think I might have seen them going into the toilets together. She might still be in there. - Made a new friend today. Hmm? I wonder what you both talked about. - Mia. - Told you she was there, Boss, that's her. - Oh yes. - I want you all outta my bar. - Eddie, the glass. - Right now! Now, now. - Do you wanna see if this thing works? Or do you wanna get the fuck outta here? Get back, get back! - Take both the girls. - I've been shot. - What is this shit? Sorry. - Clear my browser history. - C'est la vie. - That's life. - Sorry. - Bring her to me, no witnesses, kill them all. - What is that? - That's where the Morgans went centuries ago, you know that's gonna be. - A way out? - Yes. - Something's better than nothing. - Let's go. - Let's play catch. - Eddie! No, no, Eddie. No. - It's going to be, It's going to be okay, we'll get you help. We'll get everything sorted, the help you need. - There's a way out underground. - Oh no, I'm not leaving you behind. - The Orlop River, the Orlop, - What do you mean the Orlop River? Skip, no. - The Orlop. - Go see what's in there for me. - No, thank you, Mr. Walsh. We should leave. Okay. - Gang warfare. - What do we do? - There has to be a way out. - Hey, you two, with me now, come on. - No. - She works here, come on. - Guys, there's another room back here. - Come on, let's go. Hurry, hurry, hurry. Marshanda, come on, let's go. Help me. - Come on. Go! - No, Benny, Benny, come on, come on! This is your doing! - The girl's in here with me, Mr. Walsh. - Why do they want her? - Don't know. - How long have you worked here and not had access to this room? - I had no idea this was here until a minute ago. - Do you think these are access points to fix the pipes? - Well, who cares? - You shot me! I need a doctor! - How many muskets? - Muskets, god that app needs updating. Yes, muskets, very bad. - What do they want with her? - There's nowhere to run. - You should-- - Orlop River. - River? You think this pipe leads to one of the sunken rivers? - Orlop river , Skip said.. - You lot need to get your priorities straight there. - There is no Orlop River. Nearest sunken river's the Tiburn or something. Might as well just give it up. - Orlop. Orlop is the lowest part of a ship of the rogue sea cats. Skip said Orlop River, but, - It could be a way out. - Look, is there anything we can do to keep your boss happy? Well, they're obviously looking for what? - Something Cat Morgan brought down here hundreds of years ago. - Red Cat Morgan? Are you talking about Red Cat's treasure? That's just a myth. Your phone, can you translate this? - Language not found. - It's not a language in the app. Maybe you can have her say something and it'll translate that. - Can you read this? Read it. - To destination advance, coast departure urgent. - No, no, no, I think I get it. It's Red's motto written in some coded language. Skip said follow the Orlop River and this pipes say Orlop steel on it. I think Cat, Red Cat must have left that painting for someone and Marshanda knows something about it. I bet whatever they're after is through this pipe and Skip realized it when he saw the hatch. Let's try and find it. Let's try and find it, yeah. And we can give it to your boss, you can smooth things over, buy some time, and we'll keep running. You're safe. We are safe. Right? - Up that way, right? - I really can't do this. Ah! Save yourselves. - Stop showing off! Quick. - Boss, the room's empty, they've disappeared. - All right, I need a, well, well, well, what have we here? Now what is the deal with that room? - how would I know, I've never been in there? And besides, I'm way too hench to fit through that shit. - You saying I'm not hench enough? - It's a fucking hatch, what do you want? - Good point, what we want is the girl and more specifically something she has, a little wrist device, and what she can find with it. But the chief concern is where they could have gone because they're not in there. - I think this one may be able to work it out. - Me? What makes you think that? - Call it a hunch. - It's not my hat. - Come on. Come on, get on with it. - Get on with what? - Where'd they go? There's a secret door in here or something. Find it. - Keep moving. We're getting there. - Getting where? - All the way from the bad guys. - Yeah, right. - Come on. - Don't push me, stop. - Go, go. No, no, no, no, no, no. Well, shit. He's done it. He's found a little escape room. - Oh God, no, stop pushing me. I'm stuck! Stop! - Don't, no, no, please. - Hey. What's going on, why did we stop, and why are the light out? Someone talk to me, please. - No! Oh, I'm gonna die. Breathe. Oh shit, breathe, breathe. - Here, take this. - It's a penis. She's gone. The American girl's gone. Hello? Somebody's coming. Somebody's coming. - You good? I found a way out. It's crazy cool. - It's not mine, sorry. It doesn't mean anything. - Which way? We're getting closer, they definitely came this way. - All this is under the bar? - Under the bar and so far back we are no longer in Soho. - It is nice shit. - Skips Dad knew about this place. I heard voices, they're coming. - The way out's that way. - Well let's move, yeah. - If they catch us, we're dead. - Someone's been paying attention. Follow the breeze. - Hang on. Your translation app. - It's still looking. - During, let's move. - We can't hang about. - One second. - I need to go this way. - Oh, no, no, no, we need to get out here, it's too dangerous. Danger. - What do we do? - I'm sticking with her but if you wanna go, you can go. - I'll stay with you guys. Seems safer. - What are we doing hanging about, come on. - It's that way. - You said follow the breeze. - The breeze is that way. You're following the echo of the breeze. - The echo of the breeze, makes sense to me. Marshanda, slow down. Marshanda! - Try again in Mandarin. My sister, my friend. My friend. - Oh God, she's found her. - Found who? - Red Cat Morgan. My friend. - That thing around her neck, that's what Walsh has been looking for. Walsh's father was a respected historian and archeologist specializing in 18th-century piracy, in particular Red Cat Morgan and her vast riches. On one of his expeditions, he discovered three small bundles of cloth all decorated with a distinct crest, in one a pendant, in the other two, nothing. It led him to buy the Dragon Princess restaurant thinking the crest was a sign of where the treasure or, at very least, the other two pendants were kept. - That's why the symbol on her wrist matches the one on Dragon Princess restaurant. - He was wrong, it was a red herring and there was no treasure. There was no more pendants, he got the wrong place. It was an obsession that spread from father to son. All that spurred them on was that single pendant, which they knew was only one of three. Months ago, a geological expedition stumbled across Marshanda's ship. Walsh used all his underground connections to get Marshanda's body and what she wore around her wrist. It was only then he learned what his father never knew. The wrist device contains a compass which locks in on each of the pendants. When all three are brought together and inserted into the wrist device, the compass would guide the wearer to the final treasure. Marshanda's pendant guided her to Red Cat. Now it's only Walsh's piece that needs to be added before he can finally get what he wants. - I'm your crew now, you're safe, I'll take care of you. Sister. You don't want to go right? - Which way? - No, no, that looks like the wrong way. You said it was that way. You go, I fight. - Good idea, she should fight. - Shut up. - She's great at it, what'd you want from me? - What are those, tracks? - Yeah. - Must've gone down there. - Yeah, I see it. - I can't leave her. - Move, move. Get them out of here. - Stop them! - Let's get you out, come on. - I can't go back, they'll kill Eddie. - Run and get help. - Marshanda. - They need her alive, you'll do better than the others. - Get out of here, follow the breeze, go, go. - All right, all right. - Look out! No! No! - We've got them all now boss, they're not going anywhere. - Good, I'll go get Mr. Walsh down here. Let's finish this. - Look, I don't want any trouble. - You're not going get away with this. - Don't you try to move, any of you. Whoa! - Careful. - Sorry. - What, it's empty? - I knew I'd find you. - Shut up. - I thought you were dead. - I thought you were all dead. - We tried to slip a gun off one of them and then these two gave 'em the old Liam Neeson. Which one of these is loaded? - I don't know. - Is she gonna be all right? - Well, she's made of pretty tough stuff. - I have to go. - We can't get her through that pipe, not if she's out cold. - Worse than that, there's more on them waiting on the other side. - We have to go, we need get out of here, we need to follow that breeze. - Tough guy is up there. - Yeah, well we have these. - Got any gum? - Left it in the car. - It's going to be okay, we're gonna get out. - Hey, you guys, I found it, a way out. South Bank, I can see Pizza Express, it's this way. Oh, if you wouldn't mind leaving a positive Trip Advisor review, I'd be very grateful. Perhaps best not to mention the hostage situation or all of the dead people. Thank you. - Get them out, call the police now. - You're not coming. - I need to help her. - The passcode's one, two, three, four, don't check my messages. - What are you doing? - I just thought we, I just thought we were really good back there. I didn't-- - No, not really. - No?. - Don't ever do that again. - Right, sorry, sorry. - You're a strange man. - Ah, not so fast, or turner faces the soup. All clear. - Wonderful. You're all here. - Where's Eddie? - Resting Easy with the doc, helping restore your little tavern to its former glories. - There he is. Like playing with rocks, do you? Look at me. No, stop, stop, stop. - Put your hands down. Put your hands down. - Please, please, please don't let your men hurt him. Please, please, honestly, we'll help you. - Bring me the wrist device. It still works. We found Red's piece and of course Marshanda's. It's here. Bring our niece and the barmaid to keep her well behaved. Keep the rest here as a bit of extra collateral. If you behave, they'll live. If she behaves, you live. - Yeah. - Why? - Because I can and he couldn't. - Is that worth murdering my friends? - Needs must and I need her. Coordinates, leading to riches, my riches. - Aren't you rich enough? - No, I wanna be double rich. How do you like me now, Dad? With these scrolls in this particular order, I, You fucker. Do you remember the order they were in? - No, I was keeping an eye on them. - Does anyone remember the order they were in? Fuck! Years we've been working on this. - Does it say what order they should be in? - No, I can't read this shit, this is some dead pirate code. - Mia, catch. - Red Cat's painting, the code. There's something on this, it will help me open that. What if it's a booby trap? Come on Mia, come on. Come on, come on, think, think, think, think. Come on Mia, think. I got the codes. Hey, I don't suppose DeCoon's holding a first hostage rule would be a problem for you. You can't leave! I have money! - Asshole. - You can't leave me! Wait! No! - Welcome to the Smuggler's Tavern, so head to the toilets, empty those bladders before entering Benny's hatch, and crawling through the claustrophobic labyrinth of Sebastian's tunnels. - Argh, welcome mateys to the underground caves of Soho. Waterproofs are available just through here. It is quite claustrophobic, so you have been warned, no refunds. How much do pirates pay for their earrings? A buck-an-ear , come on this way. - All right, we're off. - Be careful. - Don't fuck the place up, Eddie. - Ah, she's getting really good at that. - It's the most pertinent sentence. - Seriously though, be careful. - We need money. - Very nice. And I've got pictures on my phone and the cloud. So we've got a plan B. - Nice. Hey, Mi. - Thanks. - You sure you don't want a hand with that.
