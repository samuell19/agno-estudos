Make mine music Make mine music And my heart will sing Make mine music And it's always spring All the world goes romancing When melody fills the night And even the stars go dancing To the music of the moonlight Make mine music And I'll dream of you Make mine music And the dream comes true Music will play the shadows away When everything seems to go wrong So make mine music And life will be a song Make mine music Gather round me, children, and I'll tell a story Of the mountains in the days when guns was law When two families got disputin' It was bound to end in shootin' So just listen and I'll tell you what I saw Oh, the Martins and the Coys They was reckless mountain boys And they took up family feudin' when they'd meet Every durn time! They could shot each other quicker than it took your eye to flicker They could knock a squirrel's eye out at 90 feet All their fightin' started one bright Sunday morning I remember! Cos old Grandpa Coy was full of mountain dew ... Just as quiet as a church mouse He stole into the Martins' henhouse Cos the Coys, they needed eggs for breakfast too After that they started out to fight in earnest And they scarred the mountains up with shot and shell There was uncles, brothers, cousins Why, they bumped them off by dozens Just how many bit the dust is hard to tell Oh, the Martins and the Coys They were reckless mountain boys At the art of killin' they became quite deft Mighty deft They all knowed they shouldn't do it But before they hardly knew it On each side they only had one person left Only one person left Now, the sole remaining Martin was a maiden And as pretty as a picture was this Grace - While the one survivin' boy - Was the handsome Henry Coy And the folks all knew they'd soon meet face to face - After her, Henry! - Go get her, boy! - Knock him off, Gracie! - Shoot that Coy! So they finally met upon a mountain pathway And Henry Coy, he aimed his gun at Grace Right at Grace He was set to pull the trigger when he saw her pretty figure You could see that love had kicked him in the face Oh, the Martins and the Coys They were reckless mountain boys But they say their ghostly cussin' gives you chills Cos the hatchet sure was buried when sweet Grace and Henry married It broke up the best durn feud in these here hills Come on, everybody, let's dance! Way down yonder, not far off, a jay bird died with the whoopin' cough Do si do, little more dough, chicken in the bread pan pickin' out dough "Granny, will your dog bite?". "No, child, no, he lost his teeth a long time ago" Now swing your partners, And promenade the hall, Same old road, same old train Watch that monkey walk that rail Now first couple out to the right Go round that couple and take a peek Come back to the centre and shake your feet Round that couple and peek once more Back in the centre and circle four Swing your partner and call your hound Right foot up and left foot down Bottom of your foot make a hole in the ground Now you're tall with a smile Once and a half and go hog wild Sooey, hog, sooey! Look at him run! What's the hurry, Henry? Now you may think that this is where the story ended But I'm tellin'you them ghosts don't cuss no more Cos since Grace and Henry wedded they fight worse than all the rest did And they carry on the feud just like before Roll along, blue bayou Through the silv'ry foam In the deep where sleepy shadows roam While we roll, blue bayou In your dreamy light Memories echo in my heart tonight I hear the echo of our song of love Murmuring low And here am I Still haunted by The ghost of long ago Roll along, blue bayou Through the silv'ry foam Roll the blue and sleepy shadows home Roll along, blue bayou Through the silv'ry foam In the deep where sleepy shadows roam While we roll, blue bayou In your dreamy light Memories echo in my heart tonight Roll along, blue bayou Through the silv'ry foam Roll the blue and sleepy shadows home Roll along, blue bayou Through the silv'ry foam Roll the blue and sleepy shadows home Across the blue moon Boy! Hop in the old jalop and... Head for the malted shop and... All the cats join in Down goes my last two bits Comes up one banana split And all the cats join in Drop your jack in the old jukebox Play your favourite disc When you dance with the bobby socks You dance at your own risk RIP Everybody swing Yes, swing till the rafters ring And all the cats join in Rafters ringing, how they're swinging All the cats join in I'm so lonely and blue When I'm without you I don't know what I'd do, sweetheart. Without you The joy and tears that love endears Would have no meaning If I didn't have you To keep me dreaming At the close of each day When I'm without you And my heart kneels to pray I pray about you You take a star And lead it far away from heaven And the star will be lost As I'm lost without you At the close of each day When I'm without you And my heart kneels to pray I pray about you You take a star And lead it far away from heaven And the star will be lost As I'm lost without you Oh, what a lark to ride out to the park And just to see Casey They travelled for miles and they stand in the aisles And just to see Casey The ladies don't understand baseball a bit They don't know a strike from a foul or a hit But when they see Casey that dame has got it Casey, the pride of them all The outlook wasn't brilliant for the Mudville nine that day The score was four to two With but one inning left to play Listen, ya bunch of bush leaguers, it's the ninth inning! It's the wind-up! The blow-off! Come on, unbutton your shirts! Now get in there and fight! Who's up next? Cooney! The coach was really worried when Cooney went to bat For all he had to offer was 300 pounds of fat Ah, but Cooney was determined, he tried to do his worst He kept his batting average, all right And as usual died at first You're out! Hooray for our side! Hooray! Hooray! - Aw, shut up! - Sit down! - I'll kick the stuffin' out of him! - Yeah, run that guy outta town! Barrows was the next one up, and Barrows made a hit Wow, he smacked a beauty - right in the pitcher's mitt You're out! A straggling few got up to go Ah, but the loyal fans stood pat They'd put up even money now were Casey at the bat Ah, but Flynn preceded Casey Of all the stupid guys The bat is getting in his hair Now the hair is getting in his bat Egad! He let drive a single - much to his own surprise Safe! The next one in the line-up was "No Hit" Jimmy Blake Of all the mugs in Mudville he was the biggest fake But he was really blazing and to the wonderment of all Blake the Fake tore the cover off the ball And when the dust had lifted and they saw what had occurred There was Jimmy safe at second and Flynn a-huggin' third Cosy, isn't it? You're safe! We want Casey! We want Casey! We want Casey! Oh, Casey's the guy with his eye on the ball But mostly the ladies Casey's the guy who's the idol of all But mostly the ladies Casey is mighty and manly Casey's a dangerous gent Egad, when he goes to bat, hang onto your hat He's batting a thousand percent with the ladies Oh, Casey has nerve and he knows every curve He's no hokey-pokey He gets away with that old double play He's sure okey-dokey He makes all the ladies go gaga, it's true No wonder they swoon when he comes into view He was the Sinatra of 1902 Casey, the pride of them all The pitcher's nerves were jagged and his knees began to shake Ah, can't catch me! Can't catch me! One eye was watching Flynn and the other eye watching Blake While the frightened pitcher ground the ball into his hip Defiance gleamed in Casey's eye A sneer curled Casey's lip And now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the air And Casey stood a-watching it in haughty grandeur there Close by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped "That ain't my style," said Casey Strike one! ... the umpire said From the benches, black with people, there went up a mighty roar Like the beating of the ocean on a stern and distant shore Kill him! Kill the umpire! ... yelled the cutie from the stand And it's likely they'd have killed him Had not Casey raised his hand With a smile of Christian charity great Casey's visage shone He stilled the rising tumult and bade the game go on He signalled to the pitcher and once more the spheroid flew But Casey still ignored it and the umpire said, quote: Strike two! Unquote. "Fraud!" cried the maddened thousands, and the echo answered "Fraud!" But one scornful look from Casey... And the audience was awed They saw his face grow stern and cold They saw his muscles strain And they knew that Casey would not let that ball go by again The sneer has gone from Casey's lip His teeth are clenched in hate He pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate And now the pitcher holds the ball And now he lets it go And now the air is shattered by the force of Casey's blow Somewhere in this favoured land The sun is shining bright Ah, yes... Somewhere bands are playing sweet And somewhere hearts are light Somewhere men are laughing Somewhere children shout But there is no joy in Mudville - Mighty Casey has struck out Casey, the pride of them all! Whaddaya know? The game is over. Two silhouettes Together in the afterglow Two silhouettes Become as one When lights are low And with the night slumbering on We'll build a dream for two A perfect dream Set to a theme lovely as you Two hearts on fire Will soon inspire The stars to dance The flames that stray Will light the way To our romance And when I hold you in my arms To my heart's delight Two silhouettes will drift away into the night Two hearts on fire Will soon inspire The stars to dance The flames that stray Will light the way To our romance And when I hold you in my arms To my heart's delight Two silhouettes Will drift away Into the night Will drift away Into the night Now, this is the story of... Peter and the Wolf. As you know, in the musical score of Peter and the Wolf each character is represented by an instrument in the orchestra - Peter by the string quartet. The bird, whose name is Sasha, by a flute, way up high. Sonia, the duck, by an oboe. Like this... And here is Ivan, the cat, represented by a clarinet in a very low register. Grandpapa is an old bassoon. The shooting of the hunters' guns by the kettledrums. And there is also a wolf. Little does that wolf know what's in store for him this day. For our hero, little Peter, armed to the teeth, is setting forth to capture him. There seems to have been a change of plans. For Peter's grandpapa thinks that little boys like Peter should not go out to hunt the wolf. This is very embarrassing for a great hunter. This is Sasha, the little bird we told you about. Excitable little chap, isn't he? Forgetful, too. "Hello, Petey. Where you goin'? Can I go, Petey? Can I?" "Oh, boy, a gun!" "Loaded, too. " "Goin' hunting? Oh, that's for me!" "Everything's OK, Petey. Come on, let's go. " The wolf! But it isn't the wolf at all. It's only Sonia the duck. "Hello, Sonia. " "Hello, Petey. " Now Sonia wants to join the party. Imagination is a wonderful thing. But sometimes it can run away with you. "You coward!" Now who's this? Oh, it can't be... Oh, no. It's Ivan the cat. Hello, Ivan. Ivan's a peaceful, fun-loving sort - maybe a little shy on brains. You know the type. Hey, look out, Sasha! "Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it!" Oh, how can they ever get any place if they're going to fight among themselves? Ivan, you ought to be ashamed. "You big bully!" "You cat in the grass!" Come on, Sasha. Ivan's sorry. He won't do it again. And so, once more, our little band of intrepid hunters sets forth to find the wolf. And they find him. Sonia! Sonia! Behind you! Look out! W-O-L-F! Oh, that wolf is everywhere! Peter, do something! Oh, no. Look, Peter, why don't you... Maybe if you could... Then maybe, Peter... Oh, well... Peter, don't just stand that way. Don't stand that way, either. Oh, Sonia! This is no time to relax. Poor Sonia. Well, that's one gone. Goodbye, Sonia. Will this crime go unavenged? Not if little Sasha can help it. You beast! Take this! And this! And this! How do you like this, eh? And this, eh? How about this, eh? Not so good, eh? Good work, Sasha! Trouble. Sasha! Sasha, get up! Get up! Get out of there! Look out, please, for over-confidence. This is bad. This is very bad. Saved! Just when things are looking blackest... Hark! What's that we hear? What's this we see? The hunters! Misha, Yasha and Vladimir. That's Vladimir in the middle. Wait a minute, I'll show you. W-O-L-F. Wolf. Wolf? To the rescue! Oh, Peter, you're safe! You've captured the wolf. Oh, happy day! I think I'll say that again. Oh, happy day! Oh, Peter, what a hero! You too, Ivan. Everybody's happy - except the wolf. But little Sasha isn't happy. He's thinking of his lost playmate, Sonia. Sonia... Sonia? Sonia! Then you're not dead! You're safe! Oh, Sonia, this is the most wonderful, wonderful day! The wolf is captured - Peter caught him! One, two, three... Johnnie Fedora met Alice Bluebonnet In the window of a department store 'Twas love at first sight And they promised one night They'd be sweethearts for evermore Johnnie would serenade Alice Toora-lay, toora-li, toora-lu He sang of a beautiful palace Of a beautiful hatbox for two But Johnnie Fedora lost Alice Bluebonnet To a patron of the department store Her beauty was sought by the girl she was bought by For twenty-three ninety-four Johnnie, O Johnnie Your Alice Bluebonnet Will always be waiting for you So don't give up hoping And don't give up dreaming For true love will come smiling through Johnnie Fedora was lonely and stranded In the window of the department store When, lo and behold He was suddenly sold And his heart became gay once more Johnnie sang out like a robin Toora-lay, toora-li, toora-lu To strangers he'd come up a-bobbin' "I thought you were someone I knew " He looked for her uptown and crosstown and downtown From the Brooklyn Bridge to the Jersey shore It all seemed in vain Till he heard the refrain Of the song Alice sang of yore Johnnie, O Johnnie! Your Alice Bluebonnet Will always be waiting for you So don't give up hoping And don't give up dreaming For true love will come smiling through Johnnie kept yearning, he kept on returning To the window of the department store His voice became hushed He was literally crushed And it started to rain and pour Each place he went he kept calling - Toora-lay - Toora-li - Toora-lu - La la la His spirits kept falling and falling For his Alice was nowhere in view But hey-noni-noni, an ice man found Johnnie And he cut him to fit on his horse's ears 'Twas done without malice For beside him was Alice And they lived on for years and years Giddup! You Johnnie Fedoras You Alice Bluebonnets Whenever you find yourself blue You'll find it's June in December If you just remember That true love will come smiling through That true love will come smiling through This is how it all began Just a little back-page item about a voice that sang at sea And then this fantastic news appeared on the front page And then in screaming headlines Extra! Read all about it! Paper! A singing whale? - Whaddaya know ? - Imagine that Huh! I don't believe it I don't believe it For who ever heard of an operatic whale? I don't believe it I don't believe it And headline followed headline Then doctors and experts And men of anatomical biology Debated and argued And quoted ichthyology Impossible! Preposterous! We savagely deny it Magnificent! Miraculous! We certainly certify it And even the great impresario Of the Grand Opera Raised an eyebrow And tried and tried to figure it out This whale, she's maybe swallowed an opera singer. That's it! This whale, she's a-swallowed an opera singer! I find-a the great Signor Donatelli in-a the fish market. I discovered the great Lilli Garli in-a the honky-tonky. Why not I find-a the opera singer in-a the belly of a whale, huh? I do it! Oh, get me a great big schooner and get me a good harpooner Photographers and reporters from all the newspapers Publicity! Publicity! Publicity! Publicity, yes. But to Whitey the seagull, it was opportunity - the big opportunity for his friend Willie the whale. There was no time to lose. He must bring these two together. Well, there was Tetti-Tatti now. And Tetti-Tatti was in for a wonderful surprise. Because Willie hadn't swallowed any opera singer, he could really sing. Listen. Mamma's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin' Mamma's little baby loves shortnin' bread Mamma's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin' Mamma's little baby loves shortnin' bread Two little chillun, lyin' in bed One of 'em sick and the other 'most dead Called for the doctor, the doctor said "Feed them chillun on shortnin' bread" Mamma's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin' Mamma's little baby loves shortnin' bread Mamma's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin' Mamma's little baby loves shortnin' bread After all these years of casting his "Shortnin' Bread" upon the waters, now at last success lay just over the waves. Willie! Willie, look! That's you, Willie! He's looking for you! It's your big opportunity. Willie's going to be a great star. Our Willie, going to sing grand opera. Goodbye, my friends. I'm off to be discovered I'm off to be discovered At last, the long years of patient waiting, the endless hours of faithful practice were about to be rewarded. As Willie sped to his audition he wondered what to sing for his opening number. What would impress this impresario? How about a bit of Figaro? Yes, sure, Figaro. There she's blows! There she's blows! Figaro. Figaro! Figaro! Figaro! Figaro! Figaro! Figaro! Figaro! Figaro! Figaro! Figaro! Figaro! Figaro! Figaro! Figaro! Shoot-a de whale! Figaro! Figaro! Figaro! Hurry up, hurry up! Rescue the opera singer! Don't-a worry, we'll a-save you! Bravo! Bravissimo! Bravo! Ah, but they hadn't heard the half of it. They hadn't even heard a third of it. For Willie was no ordinary singing whale. Willie could sing in three separate voices: tenor... baritone... and bass. Why, Willie was a singing miracle. Let-a me up! This is the mutiny! Mamma mia! He's-a swallowed two opera singers! He's-a swallowed three opera singers! Stubborn, deluded Tetti-Tatti. For right before his very eyes was the biggest discovery in all musical history. Just imagine, a whale singing opera on the very stage of the Met. Bravo! Bravissimo! Je suis M?phisto Roi d'enfer Je veux... Ta vie I got him! I got him! Vittoria! Now Willie will never sing at the Met. But don't be too harsh on Tetti-Tatti. He just didn't understand. You see, Willie's singing was a miracle, and people aren't used to miracles. And you, faithful little friend, don't be too sad. Because miracles never really die, and somewhere in whatever heaven is reserved for creatures of the deep, Willie is still singing - in a hundred voices, each more golden than before. And he'll go on singing, amid the applause and the cheering, forever.
