[♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [MAN]: OKAY, EVERYBODY-- BIG SMILE! OVER HERE, HELEN. VERY NICE. HAPPY COUPLE! CHARLES, HELEN, BIG SMILE! LOOKING GOOD, LADIES! [♪♪♪] TED! TED! JUST MOVE A LITTLE TO YOUR RIGHT? CHARLES, HELEN! OVER HERE. OKAY! WE GOT IT, EVERYBODY. [♪♪♪] [SNAP] [POLICE RADIOS CRACKLING INDISTINCTLY] I WENT TO TOUCH UP MY MAKE-UP IN THE BATHROOM. [BRIDE SNIFFLES] WE WERE GOING TO WALK IN TOGETHER. [SOBBING] [♪♪♪] I'VE HEARD OF THE GROOM BOLTING BEFORE THE WEDDING, BUT NEVER AFTER. SO, BETWEEN THE PICTURES AND THE RECEPTION, THE GROOM JUST DISAPPEARS? I DON'T GET IT. AND IT HAD TO BE ON FOOT, HE DIDN'T HAVE A CAR. WAS HE AMBIVALENT ABOUT THE MARRIAGE? NO! THIS IS NOT LIKE HIM. DID HELEN SAY ANYTHING ABOUT ANY PROBLEMS WITH CHARLES? NOTHING. NO. I WAS WITH HER LAST NIGHT. SHE WAS SO EXCITED AND HAPPY. [TROUBLED SIGH] [♪♪♪] [JENN]: SO... TELL ME, DANI. YEAH. NO, WE TALKED. AND? WE'RE GOING OUT FOR DINNER ON SATURDAY NIGHT. -NICE! WHAT'S HIS NAME? -JAKE. IS HE THE PHARMACIST? FIREMAN. REALLY? DON'T GO THERE. I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING. -OKAY. -WHAT MONTH? HE WAS MR. JULY. BUT IT WAS YEARS AGO. [BOTH LAUGHING] -DANI! -HEY... SO ISN'T THIS JUST A FANCY GARAGE SALE? OH, HANNAH. WHAT? OH! HANNAH, HANNAH, HANNAH. MY DARLING DAUGHTER. WE ARE GOING TO AN ESTATE SALE. OH! [♪♪♪] AND YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES, IT'S JUST LIKE THE OCCUPANTS LEFT IT. WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT? WELL, MAYBE THEY PASSED AWAY, OR THEY WENT TO A CARE FACILITY. EVERYTHING INSIDE IS LEFT JUST AS IT WAS, AND EVERYTHING IS FOR SALE, SO KEEP YOUR EYES PEELED. THAT SOUNDS CREEPY. SO WE MIGHT BE BUYING STUFF FROM DEAD PEOPLE? [LAUGHING] THAT'S USUALLY HOW IT WORKS IN THE ANTIQUE BUSINESS, SWEETHEART. HUH. THIS DOESN'T LOOK LIKE AN "ESTATE." WELL, LET'S HOPE FOR THE BEST. WE'RE GOIN' IN. OKAY. [DANI]: REMEMBER, WE BARELY HAVE ANY ROOM LEFT IN STORAGE, JENN. [JENN]: I KNOW, DANI. SLIM PICKINGS, BUT YOU NEVER KNOW. I'LL TAKE THE KITCHEN. I'LL TAKE THE UPSTAIRS. I'LL TAKE THE REST. [QUIET BACKGROUND CHATTER] [♪♪♪] [GASPS] SORRY. [♪♪♪] [RUSTLING] [♪♪♪] [DANI]: WHY ARE WE TAKING SO MANY BOXES BACK TO THE SHOP? [JENN]: YOU COULDN'T PICK AND CHOOSE, YOU HAD TO TAKE 'EM ALL. -COME ON, 20 BUCKS. -EXCUSE ME. -GREAT. -YOU WAIT AND SEE. I'M EXCITED. -A LOT OF TREASURE IN THERE. -MM-HMM. -GET ME OUT OF HERE. -LET'S GO. [♪♪♪] -TANNER? -"TYLER!" TYLER! HE'S VERY NICE. HE IS VERY NICE. HE'S ALSO SMART, GOOD-LOOKING, AND HE MAKES ME LAUGH. OH! MY EX MADE ME LAUGH... FOR ALL THE WRONG REASONS. [LAUGHS] WHAT'S HIS MAJOR? POLI-SCI. HE'S ALSO ON THE TRACK TEAM. THINK "LACE." WELL, I'M THINKING "WOMEN'S SHELTER." REALLY? NO LACE? POLYESTER, SO FAR! [DEJECTED] OH. OH! WHOA. WAIT A MINUTE. I'M FEELING LACE. [GASPS] OH. LOTS OF LACE! [ALL GASPING] [GASPING LOUDER] SEE? WHAT DID I TELL YOU? NICE CATCH, JENN! OH! IT'S A D'ARCET. -[GASPING DEEPLY] OH... -IS THAT GOOD? OH! IT'S LIKE... DIOR. VERY HAUTE COUTURE. YEAH. IT'S OLD, AND IT WASN'T STORED PROPERLY, AND THE BOTTOM'S DIRTY. WASN'T WASHED AFTER THE WEDDING. WELL, EVEN IF A DRESS IS NOT RESTORABLE, VINTAGE LACE ALONE IS ALWAYS VALUABLE. WELL, IT'S BEAUTIFUL. YOU COULD'VE BOUGHT A CAR FOR WHAT THIS COST NEW. [HANNAH]: WHEN DO YOU THINK THAT WAS? OH, 30, 40 YEARS AGO? WE COULD PROBABLY LOOK UP THE D'ARCET COLLECTION ONLINE. -MM-HMM. -LET'S SEE WHAT'S SALVAGEABLE. THERE WE GO. OH, THEY DON'T MAKE DRESSES LIKE THIS ANYMORE. I WISH THEY DID. OH, PERFECT! DOESN'T SHE LOOK PRETTY? WOW! [♪♪♪] SWEETHEART, DINNER WILL BE IN 15 MINUTES. [DISTRACTED]: MM. WAS THAT AN "I'LL BE RIGHT IN?" MM? NO, IT'S AN "I'M CONCENTRATING" MM. OKAY, THEN. I'M GONNA CALL LOGAN AT COMPUTER CAMP BEFORE WE EAT. THIS IS NOT BAD. YOU GET IT AT THE STORE? MM-HMM. ANYTHING INTERESTING HAPPEN AT WORK? MM-MM. [SETS CUTLERY DOWN] OKAY, I GET IT. I APOLOGIZE. THANK YOU. WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU? AH, THINGS HAVE BEEN REALLY CRAZY AT WORK. WE GOT THAT NEW BUILDING GOING UP AND THE CLIENTS ARE FLYING OUT IN A COUPLE WEEKS. THE WEEK AFTER NEXT? RIGHT. HOW LONG ARE THEY HERE? THROUGH THE WEEKEND, PROBABLY. THERE'LL BE ENTERTAINING, DINNERS... I'M REALLY NOT LOOKING FORWARD TO IT. [♪♪♪] HOW WAS YOUR DATE WITH THE FIREMAN? WAS IT HOT? VERY FUNNY. WE HAD A WONDERFUL TIME. THIS DRESS IS IN BETTER SHAPE THAN I THOUGHT. DRYCLEANING, A FEW LOOSE SEAMS... PERFECT! HEY! IS THAT IT? WOW! THAT'S IT. HUH. THIS DRESS IS, LIKE, 35 YEARS OLD. I WONDER WHO THE BRIDE WAS. AN EXPENSIVE DRESS LIKE THAT, IT SURE WASN'T ANYBODY WHO LIVED IN THAT OLD HOUSE! OH, THERE'S A LABEL INSIDE THAT SAYS "STILLMAN'S." MAYBE IT'S THE DRESS SHOP. SEARCH IT. [KEYS CLACKING] WELL, THEY'RE STILL IN BUSINESS, OVER IN FAIRVIEW. PRACTICALLY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. OOH! HIDDEN POCKET. OH! SO THE BRIDE COULD KEEP HER HANDKERCHIEF OR SOME PERSONAL THINGS. DANI, LOOK AT THIS. LOOKS LIKE DRIED BLOOD. SO WHAT? SOMEBODY HAD A BLOODY NOSE, AND THE BRIDE PUT THE HANDKERCHIEF IN HER POCKET. [SCOFFS] WHY WOULDN'T THE BRIDE THROW IT AWAY? WHY GET IT ANYWHERE NEAR THIS BEAUTIFUL WEDDING DRESS? NO. PLEASE, NO! AREN'T YOU CURIOUS? NOT PARTICULARLY. I SMELL A MYSTERY. [DOOR BELLS JINGLE] IT'S PROBABLY NOT ANYTHING, BUT IT MIGHT BE. IT'S A NICE DRIVE. THEY MAY KEEP RECORDS OF ALL DRESSES THEY SOLD WAY BACK WHEN, ESPECIALLY D'ARCET. [♪♪♪] [SIGHS] I'M IMPRESSED. WHAT? I'M NOT ADDICTED. NEITHER AM I! MAYBE ON THE WAY BACK. OKAY. [♪♪♪] [DANI]: HEY, DON'T YOU GUYS HAVE AN ANNIVERSARY COMING UP? [JENN]: YUP, WE DO. OH, BOY! I CAN'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME I WAS AT THE BRIDAL BOUTIQUE. [SIGHS WISTFULLY] NEITHER CAN I. WE DO KEEP RECORDS, ESPECIALLY WITH COUTURE DRESSES... NOT AS FAR BACK AS THE '70S. WELL... THAT'S US. SOMETIMES, THERE'S ANOTHER TAG WITH THE BRIDE'S MAIDEN NAME AND WEDDING DATE. THE LABEL WOULD'VE HAD BLUE STITCHING. WHY BLUE? "SOMETHING BORROWED..." "...SOMETHING BLUE." OH. RIGHT. IT'S BEEN A WHILE. HERE IT IS! THE OTHER TAG. THE BRIDE'S MAIDEN NAME? JUST HER INITIALS... "H.W." CAN YOU THINK OF ANY OTHER WAY WE COULD TRACE HER? A DESIGNER DRESS WOULD MEAN A BIG CHURCH WEDDING. YOUR BEST BET IS LOOK THROUGH OLD NEWSPAPERS AT THE LIBRARY. THERE'LL BE A PICTURE. NICE WORK! GONNA START CALLING YOU "WATSON." WELL. [SIGHS] THIS IS GONNA TAKE FOREVER. WHY NOT CUT TO THE CHASE? BIGGEST MONTH FOR WEDDINGS IS JUNE, AND WEDDING ANNOUNCEMENTS ARE IN THE "SPECIAL EVENTS" COLUMN, EVERY THURSDAY. WHOSE WEDDING ARE YOU LOOKING FOR? I DON'T KNOW. ACTUALLY, I'M... I'M LOOKING FOR A DRESS. OH. A DRESS? WELL, GOOD LUCK. [♪♪♪] BINGO. IT'S STRANGE. BIG WEDDING. THE GROOM DISAPPEARS RIGHT AFTER THE CEREMONY AND BEFORE THE RECEPTION. HERE WE GO. OH, YOU ALWAYS GET CONCERNED WHEN I'M INVOLVED WITH A MYSTERY, BUT THIS TIME, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY, BECAUSE IT HAPPENED IN 1979. PERFECT! AFTER THAT, YOU CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO AMELIA EARHART. YEAH, VERY FUNNY. ARE YOUR CLIENTS STILL COMING IN TO TOWN AT THE END OF THE MONTH? I THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD HAVE THEM OVER FOR DINNER. I THINK DINNER HERE WOULD BE A LITTLE BORING FOR THIS GROUP. THEY WANT TO GO OUT, HAVE A FEW DRINKS. AH. GOT IT. IT'S A TOUGH JOB, BUT SOMEONE'S GOT TO DO IT. AM I RIGHT? YOU'RE RIGHT! THAT'S THE SAME DRESS. CHECK OUT THE ARTICLE-- THE GROOM VANISHES IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE WEDDING. CHARLES AND HELEN CARTER, OF FAIRVIEW. BUT THE TAG SAID "H.W." HELEN CARTER WOULD BE "H.C." DANI. HER MAIDEN NAME WAS "WHITNEY." WOW! GOSH, I WONDER WHAT THE STORY IS. DID HE EVER TURN UP, OR DID HE JUST STAY DISAPPEARED, FOREVER? [JENN]: SHE'S STILL HERE, AND SHE'S A PRETTY BIG DEAL. YEAH! SHE'S ON THE BOARDS OF A LOT A CHARITIES. SCHOLARSHIPS, PROGRAMS FOR DISADVANTAGED KIDS... [CLACK] [DANI]: SHE'S STILL STUNNING. AND WE'VE GOT HER WEDDING DRESS. UM! HEY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? ARE YOU KIDDING? A GROOM DISAPPEARS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE WEDDING, NEVER TO BE SEEN AGAIN, AND WE FIND WHAT COULD BE BLOODSTAINS ON A HIDDEN POCKET? THIS COULD BE EVIDENCE. JENN, THE DRESS IS 35 YEARS OLD! IT'S A COLD CASE! IT'S NOT COLD, IT'S FROZEN. [♪♪♪] WONDERFUL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SHE'LL SEE ME. WAS THAT HER? -NO, IT WAS "SEAN." -OH. ARE THEY MARRIED? I DOUBT IT. HE REFERRED TO HER AS "MRS. CARTER." AHH... ARE YOU TAKING THE DRESS? UH, NO. I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE BLOOD CAME FROM. GONNA DO A LITTLE RESEARCH. GOOD LUCK WITH THAT, SLEUTHY. [♪♪♪] JENNIFER SHANNON? YES. I'M SEAN WATSON. I WORK FOR MRS. CARTER. -OH, NICE TO MEET YOU. -COME ON IN. THANK YOU. [GATE CREAKING] PLEASE WAIT HERE. THANK YOU. [♪♪♪] AH! JENNIFER. HELLO! HI. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING OUT. OH, WELL, THANK YOU FOR SEEING ME. I WAS OUT IN THE GARDEN, DOING SOME WORK. WE HAVE SOME LEMONADE ON THE PATIO. SOUND GOOD? SOUNDS GREAT. YOUR HOME IS MAGNIFICENT. OH, THANK YOU. A LITTLE RIDICULOUS FOR ONE PERSON, BUT WONDERFUL FOR FUNDRAISERS AND SUCH! IS THAT CARPET AUBUSSON? I DON'T KNOW. MY MOTHER DID THE HOUSE YEARS AGO. YOUR SHOP SOUNDS FASCINATING. I'M GONNA DROP BY. CUTE NAME. THANK YOU. WE BUY A LOT OF OLD ITEMS FOR THE STORE, AND, UH, RECENTLY CAME UPON A WEDDING DRESS THAT I THINK COULD BE YOURS. OH. THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE. WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT MY WEDDING? WELL, I... I SAW A NEWSPAPER ARTICLE THAT SAID YOUR HUSBAND SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED. IS THAT TRUE? YES. WE NEVER HEARD FROM HIM AGAIN. I'M SO SORRY. THANK YOU. OH, IT GOT PRETTY WILD... YOU KNOW, ALL THE SPECULATION. HE WAS KIDNAPPED AND HELD FOR RANSOM, THEN HE FOUGHT BACK AND WAS KILLED. HE RAN OFF TO THE SOUTH SEAS. HE HAD A BREAKDOWN AND WAS LIVING WITH THE HOMELESS, AND, UM... OH! AND THEN THERE WAS TALK THAT I HAD HIM KILLED FOR HIS FAMILY MONEY. I MEAN, REALLY, WOULDN'T I HAVE HAD THE DECENCY TO WAIT TILL AFTER THE RECEPTION? AND FOR THE MONEY? UH... WELL. MY FAMILY HAD MORE THAN HIS, ACTUALLY. WHY IS IT NOT POSSIBLE FOR THE DRESS TO HAVE REAPPEARED AFTER ALL THESE YEARS? I GAVE IT TO MY MAID... TO BURN IT. OH, MY GOODNESS! [ASTONISHED CHUCKLE] THAT LOOKS LIKE THE DRESS, BUT... I-IT CAN'T BE. I MEAN, SURELY, THERE WERE OTHERS. IT HAS A STILLMAN'S LABEL AND YOUR INITIALS ARE IN IT. PERHAPS THE MAID DIDN'T BURN IT, MAYBE SHE JUST HID IT. [♪♪♪] WOULD YOU LIKE IT BACK? I NEVER WANT TO SEE IT AGAIN. MAY I BUY IT FROM YOU? I CAN TRUST SEAN TO DESTROY IT. I WON'T SELL IT TO YOU. IT'S YOURS. YOU CAN HAVE IT. SEAN CAN COME BY AND PICK IT UP WHENEVER HE HAS TIME. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [CELLPHONE BEGINS RINGING] HI, HONEY. OH, I-I CAN'T TODAY. I'M... RUNNING SOME ERRANDS. WHERE AM I? WELL, I'M JUST TRYING TO FIND SOME HISTORY OUT ON THAT WEDDING DRESS. I ALWAYS STAY OUT OF TROUBLE. [LAUGHS] OKAY. I'LL SEE YOU LATER. BYE. [♪♪♪] YEAH. I'D SAY IT'S DEFINITELY BLOOD, BUT IS IT HUMAN OR ANIMAL? WELL, I CAN RUN SOME TESTS. HOW LONG WILL THAT TAKE? WELL, IT WON'T BE A PRIORITY. WHERE DID THIS COME FROM? IT'S AN INNER POCKET FROM A DRESS THAT CAME INTO THE STORE. HOW OLD IS THE DRESS? IT'S FROM 1979. [SCOFFS] THAT'S A LONG TIME AGO. IF THIS BLOOD CAME FROM AN INJURY, THAT PERSON MIGHT STILL BE AROUND. I HOPE SO. DID YOU WORK HERE THEN? OH, YOU'RE VERY FUNNY. I WAS IN COLLEGE. AND I HAVE AN AUTOPSY TO DO. WOULD YOU, UH, LIKE TO OBSERVE? THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE INVITE, BUT I THINK I WILL PASS. I'LL CALL YOU WHEN I GET THE RESULTS BACK ON THE STAIN. AND THANKS FOR THE HUMOR, IT'S USUALLY PRETTY DEAD AROUND HERE. OH! I'M GOING NOW. I'LL BE HERE ALL WEEK. DON'T QUIT YOUR DAY JOB. I WOULD, BUT IT'S KILLING ME. OH, BOY. [BOTH LAUGHING] [DOOR BELLS JINGLE] -THANK YOU. -ANY TIME. -HEY, DANI! -HI! THIS IS TYLER. -TYLER. -HI. NICE TO MEET YOU. WHERE'S MOM? OH, SHE'S ON A QUEST. THE WEDDING DRESS? YUP! MM-HMM. I GOTTA RUN. -BYE. -TAKE CARE. YOU TOO. [BELLS JINGLING] LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING WELL. YEAH... I DON'T KNOW. I WASN'T LOOKING FOR ANYTHING SERIOUS, BUT I THINK IT MIGHT BE GETTING THAT WAY. -REALLY? -I THINK SO. I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS. I THINK HE HAS SOMETHING IMPORTANT ON HIS MIND. IMPORTANT? "IMPORTANT" IMPORTANT? YOU'RE A JUNIOR IN COLLEGE! HOW IMPORTANT DO YOU WANT IT TO BE? I DON'T KNOW. WHEN YOU FIND "THE ONE," HOW DO YOU KNOW? OHH... HONEY, YOU'RE ASKING THE WRONG PERSON. I FOUND "THE ONE." AND THEN I FOUND THE NEXT "ONE." RIGHT. YOU WANT HELP? -YES, PLEASE. -ALL RIGHT. IT WASN'T A CRIME. A MISSING PERSONS' COMPLAINT. YOU KNOW? AN ADULT HAS THE RIGHT TO DISAPPEAR, IF THEY SO WANT TO. THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE A RUNAWAY GROOM, EVEN IF THEY WAIT UNTIL AFTER THE CEREMONY. BUT HE WAS NEVER HEARD FROM AGAIN. PEOPLE DON'T JUST VANISH! AS A MATTER OF FACT, THEY DO. AND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS, THEY GOT THIS SAYING-- "NO BODY, NO CRIME." WAS THERE AN INVESTIGATION? WELL, THERE WAS, BUT IT DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE. THE FAMILY HIRED A P.I. HE CAME UP WITH ZILCH, REALLY. LISTEN. I JUST GOTTA SAY I AM SO RELIEVED TO SEE THAT YOU ARE STAYING CLEAR OF ALL THE CURRENT CASES. I SUPPORT THIS WHOLEHEARTEDLY. MUCH SAFER. THANK YOU. NOW-- AND I HATE TO ASK, BUT WHY YOU THINK A MISSING PERSON'S CASE FROM 1979 IS ANYTHING BUT THAT? OKAY. I SAW A WEDDING PICTURE, A BRIDE AND A GROOM, JUST MARRIED. THE BRIDE GOES INTO THE LADIES' ROOM TO FIX HER MAKE-UP, AND WHEN SHE COMES OUT, HER HUSBAND IS GONE. NEVER TO BE HEARD FROM AGAIN. AND THERE'S BLOOD IN A HIDDEN POCKET ON HER WEDDING DRESS. THAT'S IT? THAT'S ALL YOU GOT? HOW HAVE MY HUNCHES WORKED OUT IN THE PAST? PRETTY GOOD. WELL... I GOT A HUNCH. AY-YI-YI. [SIGHS] WHO DID THE INITIAL INVESTIGATION, WHEN THEY DETERMINED IT A "MISSING PERSONS" CASE? DETECTIVE STAN PATEL. OH, HE MUST BE RETIRED BY NOW. HE'LL PROBABLY HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TO TALK. PROBABLY NOT. HE'S DEAD. MM-HMM. [TYLER]: NOW YOU GOTTA TRY THIS. IT'S GOING TO BE HOT, BUT THAT'S HUNAN. HUMAN? "WHO-NAN." GO AHEAD. OH! [EXHALING] OH... THAT'S HOT. BUT...? IT'S GOOD. WOW. OKAY, I'LL TRY A SMALLER BITE. OKAY. OKAY. SMALLER BITE. MM... MM, NICE KICK. MM-HMM. SO WHY DO THEY CALL IT HUNAN? IT'S A PROVINCE, IT'S LIKE A STATE. DIFFERENT PROVINCES IN CHINA HAVE DIFFERENT CUISINE. WHEN DID YOU GET SO INTO CHINESE FOOD? PRETTY RECENTLY, ACTUALLY. SO... THERE'S SOMETHING YOU WANTED TO TALK ABOUT? MAYBE IN A WEEK. NOT YET. YOU'RE MEAN! I JUST NEED TO BE SURE. ARE YOU NOT SURE? I'M PRETTY SURE. MAY I GET YOU ANYTHING ELSE? WE'RE FINE. [SPEAKS CHINESE] NOW YOU GOTTA TRY THIS. [♪♪♪] [SIGHS] [DOORBELL JINGLES] HI, JENN. HI! MEET MY SON, MATT. HE WORKS WITH ME, KEEPING THAT BIG HOUSE UP AND RUNNING. IT'S VERY NICE TO MEET YOU, MATT. PLEASURE, MA'AM. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. THERE'S A LOT OF COOL STUFF HERE. GO AHEAD AND LOOK AROUND WHILE I PICK UP THE DRESS. WELL... HERE YOU GO. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH IT? WELL, I'M GONNA BURN IT. JUST AS MRS. CARTER WISHES. I NOTICED THERE WAS A SCHOOL VAN AT THE HOUSE. WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT? MRS. CARTER FUNDS A MATH PROGRAM FOR UNDERPRIVILEGED KIDS WHO SHOW EXCEPTIONAL ABILITY. WOW. I-I DIDN'T WANT TO PRY WHEN I WAS THERE, BUT... DOES CHARLES CARTER HAVE ANY LIVING RELATIVES? BOTH PARENTS HAVE PASSED. THERE'S A SISTER, ALICE, IN BOSTON. MRS. CARTER ASKED ME TO CONVEY HER SINCERE GRATITUDE IN SEEING THIS RETURNED. MY PLEASURE. MATT? BYE, NOW. BYE. SHOULD I BE CONCERNED? I DON'T THINK SO. I DON'T KNOW. THIS ROMANCE WITH TYLER, IT'S... IT'S GETTING A LITTLE TOO INVOLVED. WELL, MY PARENTS WEREN'T THRILLED WHEN WE GOT ENGAGED. THEY THOUGHT I WAS TOO YOUNG. YOU WERE TOO YOUNG. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. WHAT, LIKE WE MADE A MISTAKE? NO! WE WERE BOTH SENIORS. HANNAH AND TYLER, THEY'RE JUNIORS. RIGHT. BIG DIFFERENCE. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] HEY. OH, HEY. SO... WHY ARE YOU BOTHERING TO FIX AN OLD STEREO, WHEN YOU COULD JUST DOWNLOAD 1,000 SONGS ONTO A FLASH-DRIVE AND HEAR THEM THROUGH EAR-BUDS? DIGITAL IS LIKE FAST FOOD. "OLD STEREO" IS LIKE DINING AT A FINE FRENCH RESTAURANT. WHICH WOULD YOU PREFER? DEPENDS ON WHO'S BUYING. [CHUCKLES] [CLICK] SO... WHEN DID YOU KNOW YOU WERE GONNA MARRY MOM? WHEN I FIRST SAW HER. SHE WAS STUDYING BY HERSELF AT THE LIBRARY. I WATCHED HER FOR A COUPLE WEEKS BEFORE I MADE MY MOVE. YOU STALKED MOM? WE USED TO CALL IT SHYNESS. AND SHE JUST WENT OUT WITH YOU? EVENTUALLY. SHE WAS CHARMED BY MY PERSISTENCE, GOOD LOOKS, AND FUTURE EARNING POTENTIAL. AHH. SHE SAID SHE WENT OUT WITH YOU TO MAKE HER BOYFRIEND JEALOUS. [CHUCKLES] SO WHY THE SUDDEN INTEREST IN HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER? I DON'T KNOW. JUST WONDERING. HMM. UH, I'M GONNA CALL IT A NIGHT. GOODNIGHT, DAD. GOODNIGHT, SWEETIE. [♪♪♪] HUH. IT'S OUR ANNIVERSARY, DANI. IT'S LIKE HE'S COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN. I'M SURE HE HASN'T. REALLY? HE'S GOT CLIENTS COMING IN FROM OUT OF TOWN, HE'S ENTERTAINING ON THE NIGHT. HAVE YOU TALKED TO HIM ABOUT IT? NO! IT DOESN'T COUNT IF YOU HAVE TO REMIND THEM THAT IT'S YOUR ANNIVERSARY. BUT HE'S MAKING ME... OOH! UH-OH. [BELLS JINGLE] HI. WHO'S JENNIFER? THAT WOULD BE ME. I GOT A CALL FROM FRANK LYNWOOD. HE SAID THAT YOU WERE INTERESTED IN THE CHARLES CARTER CASE. -I AM. -THIS SHOULD BE ALL THE STUFF. -OH! -OH, IT'S HEAVY. OH, WELL, YOU CAN PUT IT RIGHT THERE. THANK YOU! MY DAD WAS A DETECTIVE ON THE CASE. DETECTIVE PATEL? RIGHT. I'M HIS SON, KEITH. OH! DAD KEPT EVERYTHING. THERE'S INTERVIEWS, NOTES, OLD PHOTOS... ALL KINDS OF STUFF. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO JUST WADE THROUGH IT ALL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU KNOW, THIS ONE ALWAYS PUZZLED MY DAD. I REMEMBER HIM TALKING ABOUT IT. DID HE EVER SAY WHAT HE THOUGHT MIGHT'VE HAPPENED? [KEITH]: JUST THAT THE TRUTH WOULD HAVE TO COME OUT SOMEDAY. THIS CASE ALWAYS BUGGED HIM. LISTEN, WHEN YOU'RE DONE WITH ALL THAT, JUST GO AHEAD AND CHUCK IT. THANK YOU, KEITH. I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. -BYE. -[BELLS JINGLING] OH! DANI! CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? IT'S LIKE CHRISTMAS CAME EARLY! OH! LOOK AT ALL THESE FILES! I LIKE JEWELRY. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [JENN]: PICTURES OF THE DRESS, PAST AND PRESENT. NOW, THE BLOODWORK'S NOT BACK, BUT LET'S ASSUME IT'S HUMAN. WELL, WHO ELSE IS GONNA BE AT A WEDDING? A DOG? THAT'S WHY I'M ASSUMING IT'S HUMAN. MAY I? YES. PLEASE. SORRY. CONTINUE. HERE'S HELEN. LAST PERSON TO SEE CHARLES ALIVE. AND HERE'S CHARLES. DISAPPEARS RIGHT BEFORE THE WEDDING RECEPTION. TED THOMPSON, BEST MAN. MEG RICHMOND, MAID OF HONOR. THIS IS A PHOTO OF THE COUPLE RIGHT BEFORE THEY LEFT THE CHAPEL. WOW. RIGHT BEFORE HE DISAPPEARED? THAT'S THE LAST PHOTO TAKEN OF CHARLES. HE DOES NOT LOOK LIKE A MAN WHO JUST GOT MARRIED. NO, BUT MAYBE HE'S TIRED, OR THEY'RE THEMSELVES BEFORE THE RECEPTION. DID YOU STAY UP ALL NIGHT? YES. I WANTED TO READ THE POLICE TRANSCRIPTS. NOBODY HAD ANY REASON TO HARM CHARLES. EVERYBODY THOUGHT THAT HE AND HELEN WERE A GREAT COUPLE AND VERY MUCH IN LOVE. THIS ONE ISN'T SO HARD. REALLY? THE GUY FREAKED OUT! HE WAS RICH. EVERYONE WENT OUT ONE DOOR, HE WENT OUT THE OTHER, KEPT GOING. MONEY IN A SWISS BANK ACCOUNT, HE'S LIVING IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE. I DON'T THINK SO. MM. WHAT ARE YOUR THEORIES? KIDNAPPING? MURDER? ALIEN ABDUCTION? OH! YES. GOOD ONE. ANY AND ALL OF THE ABOVE. WELL, NOW WE'RE GETTING SOMEWHERE. PEOPLE WILL START TELLING THE TRUTH. YOU JUST HAVE TO KEEP ASKING. MY BACHELOR'S WAS IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING. SIX YEARS, UNDERGRAD AND GRAD ALL IN ONE. SOUNDS LIKE YOU WERE PRETTY FOCUSED, MR. SHANNON. YEAH. ALL I EVER WANTED TO DO WAS BUILD THINGS. HANNAH TELLS ME YOU'RE STUDYING POLITICAL SCIENCE. YEAH. I HOPE TO GO INTO INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. AND... ACTUALLY, THERE'S SOMETHING IMPORTANT I WANTED TO SHARE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I, UH... I'VE JUST BEEN ACCEPTED INTO THE YEAR-ABROAD PROGRAM AT SCHOOL. I'M GOING TO CHINA. THAT'S GREAT, TYLER. CONGRATULATIONS. WOW... CHINA. WE CAN SKYPE ALL THE TIME. IT'LL BE LIKE YOU'RE RIGHT NEXT DOOR. [THUMPS TABLE] WHO'S HAVING DESSERT? [♪♪♪] [SIGHS] YOU KNOW, YOU KINDA MESSED UP. YEAH, I'M GETTING THAT IMPRESSION. YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE SPRUNG IT ON HER. I DIDN'T KNOW I WOULD GET IN. THE PROGRAM WAS FULL. SOMEONE HAD TO DROP OUT. OH, YOUR GIRLFRIEND THINKS YOU'RE GONNA SPEND YOUR SENIOR YEAR TOGETHER AND THEN YOU PULL THE RUG OUT FROM UNDER HER? IT'S BAD. WELL... [SIGHS] WHAT SHOULD I SAY? "SORRY" IS ALWAYS A GOOD START. [TYLER]: CAN WE TALK? SURE. CAN YOU STOP TEXTING, PLEASE? I'M SORRY. I WAS GONNA TELL YOU WHEN WE WENT FOR CHINESE FOOD, BUT IT WASN'T OFFICIAL. NO BIGGIE. YOU JUST TOOK ME BY SURPRISE. YOU SURE? IT'S COOL. ANYWAY, I HAVE A PSYCH PAPER TO DO, SO I SHOULD PROBABLY GET TO IT. IT'S NOT GONNA BE THAT LONG. I'LL BE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS. YOU'LL HARDLY BE GONE. CHINA WILL BE GREAT. WE CAN WRITE LETTERS. [♪♪♪] WHAT? YOU TELL ME. NOTHING TO TELL YOU. EVERYTHING'S FINE. GOOD. [TEARFULLY]: NO. IT'S NOT. [SOBS] I REALLY LOVE HIM, MOM. I DON'T WANT HIM TO GO. I KNOW, HANNAH. I KNOW. I HATE TO LOSE MY LUNCH HOURS, SO CAN WE GET THIS OVER WITH? WOULDN'T IT BE AMAZING IF, AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, WE FIGURED OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO CHARLES CARTER? NOT REALLY. I'M JUST HERE BECAUSE I OWE YOU ONE. AND I APPRECIATE THAT. I JUST WANT TO SEE WHERE EVERYBODY WAS AND WHERE EVERYBODY WENT. HERE WE GO. AFTER THE PICTURES, EVERYONE WENT OUT THE FRONT DOORS, STRAIGHT TO THE GUILD HALL TO THE RECEPTION, EXCEPT CHARLES AND HELEN, WHO WAITED BEHIND. NOW, THE PHOTOGRAPHER WAS PACKING UP HIS EQUIPMENT. HE SAID THEY SEEMED QUIET, THEY WERE BARELY TALKING, WHICH STRUCK HIM AS ODD, BECAUSE NEWLYWEDS ARE USUALLY UP AND EXCITED. EVENTUALLY, THEY WENT OUT THE SIDE DOOR. SIDE DOOR! "SIDE DOOR." THIS IS FUN, ISN'T IT? YEAH. EVERYBODY WAS ALREADY INSIDE, WAITING FOR THEM TO MAKE THEIR BIG ENTRANCE. THEY CAME IN THE BACK, HERE. DOWN HERE IS THE DOOR TO THE RECEPTION HALL. HELEN WANTED TO FIX HER MAKE-UP, SO SHE WENT INTO THE LADIES' ROOM RIGHT THERE. WHEN SHE CAME OUT, CHARLES SHOULD'VE BEEN STANDING RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE, BUT HE WASN'T. NOW SHE'S CONFUSED. WHERE IS HE? SO... SHE GOES THIS WAY. HELEN IS NOW FRANTICALLY SEARCHING FOR CHARLES. HE'S NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. THE GROOMSMEN SPRING INTO ACTION. THEY LOOK IN THE CHAPEL, THE RECTORY. THEY EVEN GET IN THEIR CARS AND SEARCH THE NEIGHBORHOOD. CAN'T FIND HIM. MEANWHILE, BACK AT THE RECEPTION, HELEN IS LOSING IT. THE POLICE ARE CALLED. DETECTIVE PATEL COMES IN AND INTERVIEWS THE WEDDING PARTY. WOW. HALLWAY. "HALLWAY." THIS IS THE LAST-KNOWN LOCATION FOR CHARLES. HELEN GOES TO THE RESTROOM TO FIX HER MAKEUP, AND HE DOES... WHAT? WELL, HE GOES OUT THE BACK DOOR AND HE RUNS AWAY. MAYBE HE RUNS. OR... "OR..." [♪♪♪] HE COULD HAVE HIDDEN IN HERE. SO, NOW YOU HAVE HIM HIDING IN HERE BECAUSE HE CAN'T BRING HIMSELF TO ATTEND THE RECEPTION. BUT HE MANNED UP AND GOT THROUGH THE WEDDING? I DON'T BUY IT. WELL, THERE ARE OTHER THEORIES. HIS PARENTS HAD A LOT OF MONEY. I MEAN, WHO WOULD'VE SEEN IT IF KIDNAPPERS PULLED UP TO THE BACK OF THE HALL, GRABBED HIM WHILE HELEN WAS DOING HER MAKE-UP, AND TOOK OFF? AND THEN FORGET TO ASK FOR A RANSOM? WELL, MAYBE THEY TOOK HIM SOMEWHERE TO HOLD HIM, HE TRIED TO ESCAPE, THERE WAS A STRUGGLE AND HE ENDED UP DEAD. THAT WOULD EXPLAIN WHY NO ONE EVER HEARD FROM HIM AGAIN AND THERE WAS NO RANSOM. YOU'RE REACHING. AND THIS ALL HAPPENED, LIKE, 35 YEARS AGO. THERE'S NO STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ON MURDER. [SCOFFS] OKAY. DO YOU HAVE ANY EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT SUCH A THING? ANYTHING? WORKING ON IT. [PROJECTOR CLICKS AND WHIRS] AHH... AH-HAH! [BELLS JINGLING] [PROJECTOR SLOWING TO A HALT] I BROUGHT THIS FOR YOU FROM THE SALON. IT'S THE LATEST ISSUE OF TODAY'S MODERN WOMAN. OH, FOR GOODNESS SAKES. YOU KNOW I HATE THESE MAGAZINES. IF YOU THINK THAT JASON'S FORGOTTEN YOUR ANNIVERSARY, LEAVE THAT LYING AROUND, LIKE ON HIS WORKBENCH... GIVE HIM SOME IDEAS. "CELLULITE LIFETIME CURE." WHAT? NO, NO, NO, THE ARTICLE ON "EXCITING WEDDING ANNIVERSARY IDEAS." HERE IT IS. "GO FOR A HOT-AIR BALLOON RIDE." -OOH! -"SWIM WITH THE DOLPHINS." FUN! "COUPLES' BUNGEE-JUMPING." REALLY? WELL, YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S ALL GRUMPY, THINKING HE'S BLOWING YOU OFF TO ENTERTAIN CLIENTS. WHAT DO YOU WANT HIM TO DO? CANCEL THEM? NO, BUT HE COULD SEND ME FLOWERS, OR PROMISE ME A NICE WEEKEND AWAY. IS THAT ALL THERE IS? GRUNTING AT EACH OTHER IN PASSING? YEP. THAT'S IT. [GASPS] OH, YOU'RE MEAN! -I DIDN'T MAKE THE RULES. -MEAN, MEAN. [♪♪♪] WELL, IT IS DEFINITELY HUMAN BLOOD. TYPE "O"-NEG, AT THAT. IS THAT SIGNIFICANT? IT'S QUITE UNCOMMON-- ONLY 8% OF THE POPULATION. WAIT A MINUTE. HERE IT IS. CHARLES CARTER WAS "O"-NEGATIVE. IT'S A LITTLE SUSPICIOUS, GRANTED, BUT IT WOULDN'T GET YOU ANYWHERE IN A COURT OF LAW. WHY? WHY NOT, IF IT'S THAT RARE? I SAID "UNCOMMON," NOT RARE. OUT OF 100 PEOPLE, 8 WOULD HAVE THAT BLOOD TYPE. OKAY, WELL, THEN CROSS-REFERENCE THOSE EIGHT WITH PEOPLE WHO DISAPPEARED UNDER SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES. WELL... YOU MAY HAVE A POINT. I THINK THESE BLOODSTAINS ARE FROM CHARLES CARTER. [♪♪♪] THIS IS A BIG CLUE. NOT ONLY IS IT HUMAN BLOOD, IT MATCHES CHARLES'S UNCOMMON TYPE. BUT... WHAT ABOUT HELEN'S BLOOD TYPE? OR THE MAID OF HONOR'S? OR THE WHOLE REST OF THE WEDDING PARTY? WELL, ALL I KNOW IS THERE IS A 92% PROBABILITY THAT THEIRS IS NOT "O"-NEGATIVE, SO I AM GOING WITH THAT. CHARLES CARTER SEEMINGLY HAD EVERYTHING AHEAD OF HIM. HANDSOME, ATHLETIC, WEALTHY, MARRYING A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, AND, POOF, HE JUST DISAPPEARS. BEST MAN WAS KINDA CUTE. -TED, RIGHT? -RIGHT. WONDER WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE NOW. OH, I'LL LET YOU KNOW. I'M SEEING HIM THIS AFTERNOON. -MM? -MM. [♪♪♪] -HELLO. -HI. HI. YOU MUST BE JENN. YES, THANK YOU FOR SEEING ME, MR.-- -AH! -OH! ...MR. THOMPSON. TED. PLEASE. UH, LISTEN, I'M JUST DOING A LITTLE WORK ON MY BABY. WOULD YOU MIND IF WE TALK WHILE I WORK? OH, NOT AT ALL. SO, I'M CURIOUS. WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO FIGURE OUT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED MORE THAN 30 YEARS AGO? OH, I LOVE MYSTERIES. I LIKE TO SOLVE 'EM. BOTHERS ME WHEN I CAN'T. SO YOU WANT TO SOLVE THE MYSTERY OF THE DISAPPEARING BRIDEGROOM? I DO. THAT'S A WEDDING JOKE. -[BOTH LAUGHING] -ATTEMPT AT. WELL, HERE SHE IS. 1970 CHEVELLE SS. BOUGHT HER ABOUT 30 YEARS AGO, FRAME-UP RESTORATION. PRETTY SWEET, HUH? MY HUSBAND WOULD LOVE THIS. WELL, SEND HIM ON BY. I'LL LET HIM TAKE IT FOR A SPIN. ARE YOU KIDDING? I'M AFRAID I WOULDN'T GET HIM BACK. [TED LAUGHS] SO, WHAT'S YOUR THEORY? I, UH, READ A TRANSCRIPT OF AN INTERVIEW YOU GAVE TO DETECTIVE PATEL. SO YOU KNOW THE STORY. WELL, PART OF IT. YOU AND CHARLES WERE CHILDHOOD FRIENDS? UH, WELL, MY FATHER WAS THE GARDENER FOR THEIR ESTATE, SO, YES, CHARLES AND I GREW UP TOGETHER, BUT WE'RE AS DIFFERENT AS DIFFERENT COULD BE. HOW SO? WELL, I WAS A SCRAPPY NON-CONFORMIST. I RODE A MOTORCYCLE. CHARLES, HE HAD A WHOLE DIFFERENT SET OF EXPECTATIONS. RIGHT? HE WAS SUPPOSED TO TAKE OVER THE FAMILY BUSINESS, AND IT WAS THE WHOLE COUNTRY-CLUB LIFESTYLE. I MEAN, SOCIETY BALLS AND WHATNOT. IT MUST'VE BEEN STRANGE TO BE PART OF A SOCIETY WEDDING. I THOUGHT IT WAS A HOOT. YOU KNOW, THE FUNNY THING IS, I'M LIVING THE LIFE THAT CHARLES WANTED. ALL RIGHT, I LOOK BACK ON IT, AND I THINK I DID OKAY. I MEAN, I OWN THIS PLACE. DID YOU KNOW HELEN AS WELL? SHE WAS, YOU KNOW, MY BEST FRIEND'S FIANCEE, SO YEAH, WE SAW EACH OTHER, BUT, I MEAN, WE WERE FROM TWO DIFFERENT WORLDS. IT WAS A WHOLE UPSTAIRS/DOWNSTAIRS THING. HOW DID SHE HANDLE IT, AFTER THE DISAPPEARANCE? HARD. CHARLES'S PARENTS SPENT A LOT OF MONEY TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT, AND THEY CAME UP WITH ZIP. AFTER THAT, SHE JUST LOCKED HERSELF AWAY. I NEVER SPOKE TO HER SINCE, AND I NEVER SAW HER AGAIN. DID YOU TRY TO SEE HER? I, UH... CALLED A COUPLE OF TIMES. DROPPED BY. SHE WOULDN'T SEE ME. I THINK IT WAS TOO PAINFUL. WHAT ABOUT THE MAID OF HONOR MEG RICHMOND? HAVE YOU TALKED TO HER? NO, I NEVER SPOKE TO MEG. THEY WERE A PART OF THE SAME CROWD. DO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE WANTED TO HARM CHARLES? WELL, I SUPPOSE ANYTHING'S POSSIBLE. NOTHING I KNEW ABOUT, THOUGH. I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING. HAVE A LOOK AT THAT. IT'S DATED 1989. NO MESSAGE. 10 YEARS SINCE CHARLES DISAPPEARED, TO THE DAY. DID YOU TAKE THIS TO THE POLICE? WELL, YEAH, BUT THERE'S NOTHING TO CONNECT IT WITH CHARLES. I MEAN, IT'S NOT EVEN HIS HANDWRITING. WELL, MAYBE SOMEONE ELSE ADDRESSED IT. YEAH. MAYBE. I JUST THINK IT'S A SICK JOKE. YOU CAN KEEP THAT, IF YOU WANT. WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED TO CHARLES? I'VE THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT THAT OVER THE YEARS. I LIKE TO THINK HE'S ALIVE AND WELL. [BELLS JINGLING] OH, HEY, TYLER. HEY, MRS. SHANNON. HANNAH'S NOT WORKING TODAY. I KNOW. ARE YOU OKAY? I DON'T THINK SO. CAN I BUY YOU A CUP OF COFFEE OR SOMETHING? I NEED YOUR ADVICE. SURE. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. OKAY. I'M NOT REALLY SLEEPING. IT JUST KEEPS GOING AROUND IN MY HEAD. HANNAH'S BEEN SO DISTANT. I KNOW SHE CARES, SO WHY IS SHE ACTING LIKE SHE DOESN'T? OH, SHE CARES. I'VE NEVER FELT THIS WAY ABOUT A GIRL BEFORE. I'M THINKING ABOUT NOT GOING IF IT MEANS THAT MUCH TO HER. TYLER... IF YOU DON'T GO TO CHINA, YOU MIGHT REGRET THAT DECISION FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. BUT IF I LOSE HANNAH, IT MIGHT BE WORSE. MAYBE. I'M AFRAID THERE IS NO EASY ANSWER. YOU CAN'T JUST TELL ME WHAT TO DO? OH, SWEETHEART, I WISH I COULD. EVERY RELATIONSHIP HAS BUMPS, YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND YOUR WAY THROUGH. THIS FEELS MORE LIKE A SINKHOLE. [♪♪♪] PATEL'S NOTES SAY THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT HOME MOVIES THAT ARE SPLICED TOGETHER ON ONE REEL. OKAY. [WHIRRING] [♪♪♪] WAIT A MINUTE. WAS THAT HELEN AND TED IN THE BACKGROUND? OH, I DON'T KNOW. IT WENT BY SO FAST, I CAN'T TELL. CAN YOU PAUSE IT? NO. I DON'T THINK YOU CAN PAUSE FILM. IT'LL MELT OR SOMETHING. CAN THAT BE DIGITIZED? I DON'T KNOW. PROBABLY. YOU'D HAVE TO FIND A PLACE THAT DOES THAT. WHAT DO YOU THINK? I THINK'S IT TIME TO GO HOME. FOR YOU, TOO. IF YOU'RE NOT IRRITATED WITH ME, THEN HOW COME I HAVE THAT FEELING? I DON'T KNOW. YOU SURE? JUST TIRED. HONEY, IF YOU DON'T TELL ME, I CAN'T FIX IT. SWEETHEART, YOU DON'T HAVE TO "FIX" ANYTHING. GOODNIGHT. LOVE YOU. [SIGHS] LOVE YOU, TOO. [♪♪♪] [DANI]: SO? WELL, I THINK HE'S FINALLY STARTING TO GET THE MESSAGE. THEY DO NEED A LOT OF GUIDANCE. MM. [BELLS JINGLE] FLOWERS FOR JENNIFER SHANNON? OH. OVER HERE. -OH... -HERE YOU GO. -THANK YOU VERY MUCH. -HAVE A GREAT DAY. YOU TOO. "I BLEW IT. I'M SORRY. "I'LL TAKE YOU AND THE... KIDS "OUT FOR A SPECIAL DINNER TO MAKE UP. LOVE, JASON." HE DIDN'T. -HE DID! -WITH THE KIDS? -WITH THE KIDS. -WOW. OH... WELL, APPARENTLY, HE ONLY GOT HALF THE MESSAGE. [BELLS JINGLE] [SIGHS QUIETLY] HELLO! WELCOME TO RAGS TO RICHES. I'M LOOKING FOR THE OWNER, A MRS. SHANNON? OH, I'M JENNIFER SHANNON. I'M ALICE CARTER. CHARLES'S LITTLE SISTER. [♪♪♪] [ALICE]: YOU NEED TO SEE THIS. [JENN]: I DIDN'T KNOW THIS PLACE WAS HERE. DO YOU LIKE IT? OH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL. AND IT'S LOVELY THAT IT'S NAMED AFTER YOUR BROTHER. SHE NEVER WANTED HIM FORGOTTEN. SHE? HELEN WHITNEY. YOU MEAN HELEN CARTER? RIGHT, THEY WERE MARRIED, I GUESS. EVEN A HALF-HOUR COUNTS. ALICE, DID YOU THINK THE MARRIAGE WASN'T VALID? [ALICE HUFFS DISMISSIVELY] HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN THEY GOT MARRIED? 17. YOU WEREN'T IN ANY OF THE PICTURES. NO. I THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN. DON'T YOU? OH, I DON'T KNOW. PERHAPS YOU WERE TOO YOUNG. DID YOU KNOW MEG RICHMOND, THE MAID OF HONOR? OH, YES. BEAUTIFUL MEG. HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO HER RECENTLY? SHE PASSED YEARS AGO. CAR ACCIDENT, I THINK. WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED ON THAT DAY? I HAVE NO IDEA. I WAS OUT IN THE PARKING LOT. YOU WEREN'T AT THE RECEPTION? WHY? I HAD A BOYFRIEND. IT WASN'T OFTEN WE COULD GET AWAY. I UNDERSTAND YOUR FAMILY HIRED PRIVATE INVESTIGATORS. ONE OF THE THEM TALKED TO A GROUNDSKEEPER WHO WAS WORKING AT THE CHURCH. HE WAS DOING SOME PLANTING, A FAIR DISTANCE AWAY FROM THE GUILD HALL. HE LOOKED UP AND SAW CHARLES AND HELEN ENTER THE BACK OF THE BUILDING. HE NEVER SAW CHARLES COME OUT. [♪♪♪] WELL, HERE YOU GO. ENJOY. WELL! WHILE YOU'RE OUT SOLVING MYSTERIES, I'M KEEPING THE STORE AFLOAT. OH. SELL SOMETHING? YES! BAKELITE BACKGAMMON SET, $125. NICE! HEY, UH, AND HELEN CARTER CALLED HERE. ASKED IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND GOING BY THIS AFTERNOON. KINDA INTERESTING THAT SHE CALLS THE SAME DAY THAT ALICE SHOWS UP. "KINDA"? WHAT DID ALICE HAVE TO SAY? WELL, SHE'S A LITTLE ODD. SHE DEFINITELY DOESN'T LIKE HELEN. MM. SO WHAT'D SHE SAY? WELL, TURNS OUT THERE WAS A GARDENER, WHO SAW CHARLES GO INTO THIS BUILDING, BUT DID NOT SEE HIM LEAVE. YOU SAID THERE WAS A ROOM HE COULD'VE HIDDEN IN. YES, A STORAGE ROOM. AND IF THE GARDENER WAS DIGGING WITH HIS HEAD DOWN, CHARLES COULD'VE GONE OUT THE BACK, HE NEVER WOULD'VE NOTICED. THAT'S POSSIBLE. WASN'T HANNAH SUPPOSED TO BE WORKING TODAY? YEAH. SHE CALLED. ASKED IF IT WOULD BE OKAY IF SHE DIDN'T COME IN. SHE SOUNDED KIND OF DOWN. [SIGHS] THANK YOU. FEEL BETTER? [CHUCKLES] A LITTLE. TELL ME. REALLY? REALLY. OKAY, FINE. MEN ARE A SUB-HUMAN SPECIES. WELL, EXCEPT FOR DAD. HOW DID YOU GET SO LUCKY? WELL, I OVERLOOK SOME THINGS. [BOTH CHUCKLING] I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE ALL SENIOR YEAR WHILE TYLER IS IN CHINA. WHAT HAVE YOU TOLD HIM? NOTHING, BUT I THINK HE'S GETTING THE MESSAGE. I GOT A FEW TEXTS FROM HIS FRIENDS THAT SAY HE'S ALL TORN UP AND THAT HE MIGHT PULL OUT OF THE CHINA THING. I WANT TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT. IS THIS CLICHE TIME? "IF YOU LOVE SOMEBODY, LET THEM GO..." NO. IT'S JUST THE BEST MOM-ADVICE I HAVE. IF YOU REALLY LOVE SOMEBODY, AN INTERESTING THING STARTS TO HAPPEN-- YOU END UP WANTING WHAT THEY WANT. [♪♪♪] SO YOU CAN JUST TAKE THAT AROUND TO THE BACK. OKAY? THANK YOU. HI! HI. SORRY ABOUT ALL THE HUB-BUB. WE'RE HAVING A FUNDRAISER FOR THE FREE CLINIC THIS WEEKEND. 200 PEOPLE! OH! THAT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE. DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS AT 4:00 IN THESE BIG HOUSES? TEA. COME ON. IT ALMOST MAKES THE PROPERTY TAXES WORTH IT. [♪♪♪] THANK YOU. I WANTED TO THANK YOU PERSONALLY FOR BRINGING THE DRESS BACK. OH, I WAS HAPPY TO DO IT. YOU KNOW... A LOT OF MEMORIES HAVE BEEN UNEARTHED WITH THAT. I UNDERSTAND YOU'VE TAKEN AN INTEREST IN CHARLES' DISAPPEARANCE? I HAVE. I'M FASCINATED BY A MYSTERY AND THIS CERTAINLY IS ONE. YOU KNEW TED THOMPSON. WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT HIM? TED? WELL, UM, I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW HIM THAT WELL. HE WAS A CHILDHOOD FRIEND OF CHARLES', AND HE DIDN'T REALLY FIT IN OUR GROUP. SO YOU SPOKE TO HIM? YES, AND HE, LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE, IS AT A LOSS TO WHAT HAPPENED ON THAT DAY. CHARLES' FATHER WAS CONVINCED THAT IT WAS A KIDNAPPING. WHY? WELL, HE HAD A NUMBER OF BUSINESSES. CONSTRUCTION, BIG GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, AND I GUESS THERE WAS SOME DIFFICULTY WITH THE UNION, AND THERE WERE SOME THREATS. AGAINST CHARLES? NO, AGAINST HIS FATHER, AND EDWARD WOULD NOT BUCKLE TO THEIR DEMANDS, SO, IN HIS OPINION, CHARLES'S DISAPPEARANCE WAS TIED TO THAT SOMEHOW. WHAT DO YOU THINK? [SCOFFS QUIETLY] RIDICULOUS. THIS IS NOT A MISSING PERSONS CASE. IT'S MURDER. HOLD ON A SECOND. ARE YOU SAYING THAT HELEN CARTER KILLED HER HUSBAND ON HER WEDDING DAY? NO, I'M NOT SAYING THAT. GOOD! SHE'S A PILLAR OF THE COMMUNITY. NO ONE DOES MORE THAN HER. SCHOLARSHIPS, CHARITIES-- I MEAN, SHE HAS A MAGNET SCHOOL IN HER HOME, FOR GOODNESS SAKES. I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT HELEN IS A KILLER, BUT I THINK SHE KNOWS WHO IS. CHARLES CARTER'S BLOOD IS ON HER WEDDING DRESS. FRANK, SHE WAS THERE! NO. NOT NECESSARILY. THAT BLOOD IS ONLY HIS TYPE. HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE AT THE WEDDING? 200. AND HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE WORN THAT DRESS IN THE LAST 35 YEARS? I DON'T THINK ANYONE HAS. HER INITIALS ARE STILL IN IT. I THINK IT SAT IN THE BOX FOR ALL THOSE YEARS. AND WE KNOW THAT HELEN WANTED IT DESTROYED. I THINK WHATEVER HAPPENED TO CHARLES HAPPENED IN THE BACK OF THAT RECEPTION HALL. ALL RIGHT, THEN HE WAS SEEN GOING IN-- AND NOBODY SAW HIM COME OUT. WHAT IF I CAN SHOW THAT THERE WAS BLOOD SHED AT THE CHURCH AND IT MATCHES THE STAINS ON THE DRESS? [GRUNTS] WHAT'S THAT STUFF THAT YOU SPRAY TO REVEAL BLOODSTAINS THAT HAVE BEEN CLEANED UP? -LUMINOL. -LUMINOL! WOULD IT WORK ON SOMETHING THIS OLD? WELL, IF THE BLOOD WAS INDOORS, AND IT WAS PROTECTED FROM THE ELEMENTS... AND NO, I AM NOT GOING TO DO A FORENSIC INVESTIGATION FOR YOU. OH... FINE. CAN I BORROW SOME? THANKS FOR THE PIE. [SIGHS GRUDGINGLY] LUMINOL IS AVAILABLE ONLINE. AND I DO NOT WANT TO KNOW. [BACKGROUND CHATTER] [♪♪♪] WELL, I'M NOT GONNA STAY. YOU SHOULD GO, TOO. I WANT TO CATCH UP ON THESE ORDERS. JASON'S WORKING LATE. I'LL BE FINE. ALL RIGHT. NIGHT-NIGHT. NIGHT. -SEE YOU TOMORROW. -OKAY. [♪♪♪] [KEYS CLACKING] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [LOUD THUD] [GASPS] [DOGS BARKING NEARBY] [♪♪♪] [DISPATCH RADIO CRACKLING] YOU OKAY, HON'? OH, YEAH, I'M FINE, IT'S JUST A FLAT TIRE. CAN YOU SEE WHAT SHE RAN OVER? SHE DIDN'T RUN OVER ANYTHING. THIS WAS DELIBERATE. I'M NOT SURE, JENN. WHAT IF THIS WAS A WARNING? SOMEONE TELLING YOU TO BACK OFF? I DON'T THINK SO. TIRES GET SLASHED. IT'S PROBABLY JUST VANDALISM. NOT IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD. HONEY, I DON'T THINK THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THIS CASE ARE THE TIRE-SLASHING TYPES. JUST BE CAREFUL, OKAY? DON'T WORK LATE BY YOURSELF. CALL ME IF YOU NEED TO. BE EXTRA AWARE. I WILL... BUT SOMETIMES A FLAT TIRE IS JUST A FLAT TIRE. OH, DID YOU GET THE FLOWERS I SENT YOU? THANK YOU. I KNEW YOU'D REMEMBER. YEAH. IT'LL BE FUN. WE DON'T GET OUT MUCH AS A FAMILY ANYMORE. [FORCED CHUCKLE] NAH, YOU CAN'T FIX THIS. YOU'RE GONNA NEED A NEW TIRE. I'LL GET ONE OF MY GUYS ON IT RIGHT AWAY. I CAN'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME I SAW A TIRE SLASHED LIKE THAT. OH, IT'S PROBABLY JUST VANDALISM. WELL, YOU SAID YOU WENT TO THE CHURCH WITH THE POLICE, RIGHT? ARE THEY INTERESTED IN THIS AGAIN? NO, DETECTIVE LYNWOOD IS JUST AN OLD FRIEND. IT'S NOTHING OFFICIAL. MM. SO HAVE YOU MADE ANY PROGRESS? NOT MUCH. WHAT ELSE DO YOU REMEMBER FROM THAT DAY? WHAT WAS HELEN'S MOOD LIKE WHEN THEY WERE TAKING THE PHOTOS? UH, MY RECOLLECTION IS-IS THAT SHE WAS LAUGHING, UPBEAT. EVERYBODY WAS HAVING FUN. AND EVERYONE WALKED INTO THE RECEPTION TOGETHER? DID ANYONE STRAGGLE BEHIND? GO TO THEIR CAR? ANYTHING? WELL, I-- YOU KNOW, I CAN'T BE SURE, BUT IF SOMEONE WENT TO THEIR CAR TO GET SOMETHING, I MIGHT NOT HAVE NOTICED. LUMINOL? ARE YOU SERIOUS? WHAT, NOW YOU'RE DOING FORENSICS? WELL, WHY NOT? MAYBE WE'LL FIND SOME ANSWERS. I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING. I HAD THOSE EIGHT-MILLIMETER FILMS TRANSFERRED TO DVD. I WANT YOU TO WATCH 'EM AGAIN. BOTH HELEN CARTER AND TED THOMPSON TOLD ME THAT THEY REALLY DIDN'T KNOW EACH OTHER, DIDN'T HAVE MUCH INTERACTION, TRAVELED IN DIFFERENT CIRCLES, SO WATCH THIS. [♪♪♪] HMM... THAT'S PRETTY FRIENDLY. MM. SO IF I PAUSE... [HITS KEY] AND ZOOM IN... WHY IS HE LYING? 'CAUSE AFTER THE LAST FOUR DECADES, THINGS HAVE GOTTEN A LITTLE HAZY? FAIR ENOUGH. WHAT DO WE GOT? UM... WELL, IN A 15-MINUTE WINDOW BETWEEN THE PHOTO SESSION AND HELEN ENTERING THE RECEPTION HALL, CHARLES DISAPPEARS. THERE ARE THREE POSSIBILITIES-- ONE, TO YOUR POINT, HELEN WENT IN THE BATHROOM TO DO HER MAKE-UP, AND CHARLES BOLTED OUT THE BACK DOOR TO TAHITI OR SOMEPLACE. NOT LIKELY. BUT THERE IS THAT POSTCARD. TWO, HELEN WENT IN THE BATHROOM AND KIDNAPPERS CAME IN THE BACK DOOR AND GRABBED CHARLES. HE WOULD'VE PUT UP A FIGHT. UNLESS THEY HAD A GUN ON HIM. OR, THREE, SOMEBODY KILLED CHARLES IN THE BACK OF THAT RECEPTION HALL. WE HAVE THE GARDENER THAT SAW HIM GO IN THE BUILDING, BUT DIDN'T SEE HIM LEAVE, AND WE HAVE THE BLOODSTAINS IN THE HIDDEN POCKET THAT MATCH CHARLES'S RARE BLOOD TYPE. IF SOMEONE'S KILLED, THERE'S A BODY. WHERE'S THE BODY? LET'S FIND OUT. I'M HAPPY TO HELP, BUT THIS WAS ALL... OF COURSE, BEFORE MY TIME. DO YOU NEED ANYTHING ELSE? NO, I THINK WE'RE GOOD. I'LL BE IN THE RECTORY. JUST LEAVE THE DOOR UNLOCKED WHEN YOU GO. THANK YOU. THANKS. [♪♪♪] DANI. YES. WATCH YOUR STEP. YEAH. I THINK THIS IS WHERE IT HAPPENED. -SOMEONE-- -WHO? WHOA, SLOW DOWN THERE, WATSON. I'M ON "WHAT HAPPENED," NOT "WHODUNNIT." BUT I DON'T THINK IT WAS PLANNED. CRIME OF PASSION? PERHAPS. I THINK SOMEONE MET CHARLES HERE, MAYBE IN THE HALLWAY. THEY BEGAN TO HAVE WORDS, THEY CAME IN HERE FOR MORE PRIVACY. THE ARGUMENT BECAME A STRUGGLE. CHARLES WAS KILLED, PROBABLY BY A KNIFE. SOMETHING LIKE THIS. HELEN COMES IN AND SEES THE FIGHT, OR SHE COMES IN AFTERWARDS. THE KILLER IS IN SOME KIND OF RELATIONSHIP WITH HELEN, AND THEY NEED TO MAKE THIS NIGHTMARE GO AWAY. FIRST, HIDE THE WEAPON. THE KILLER GRABS A CLOTH NAPKIN, CAREFULLY REMOVES THE KNIFE FROM THE BODY, PUTS THE BLADE IN THE CLOTH NAPKIN, HANDS IT TO HELEN, WHO PUTS IT IN THE HIDDEN POCKET. NOW FOR THE BODY. YOU COULD HIDE A BODY IN ANY OF THESE CABINETS. PLENTY OF ROOM. PUT THE BODY IN THERE, CLOSE THE DOOR. THE BODY IS GONE-- AT LEAST TEMPORARILY. THERE MIGHT STILL BE SOME BLOOD RESIDUE IN ONE OF THESE CABINETS. HERE. HELP ME. I'M GONNA TAKE SOME LUMINOL, I'M GOING TO SPRAY IT ON THE BOTTOM OF THIS CABINET, I'M GONNA TURN THE LIGHTS OFF, AND IF I'M RIGHT, WE SHOULD SEE SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING. [♪♪♪] [SPRITZING] [♪♪♪] [SNAP] WOW. I'M GONNA DENY IT IF YOU TELL ANYONE THIS, BUT... [SIGHING] YOU SURE ARE SOMETHING. THANK YOU, FRANK. BUT... I AM NOT GONNA GO TO THE D.A. AND OPEN UP A COLD CASE INVOLVING A PROMINENT CITIZEN WITHOUT MORE THAN THIS. A LOT MORE. LIKE WHAT? LIKE,WHO DID IT? LIKE WHERE'S THE BODY? WHAT'S THE MOTIVATION? OKAY. I THINK THE KILLER IS TED, THE BEST MAN. THE ACCOMPLICE-- HELEN, THE BRIDE. THEY WERE IN SOME KIND OF RELATIONSHIP TOGETHER. THERE'S YOUR MOTIVATION. WHERE'S THE BODY? THE BODY WAS HIDDEN IN A STORAGE CABINET, RETRIEVED LATER, AND DISPOSED OF. FRANK, THE BLOOD STAIN WAS RIGHT WHERE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE. THAT IS WHAT WE CALL CIRCUMSTANTIAL. WHAT MORE DO YOU NEED? THE MURDER WEAPON. FINGERPRINTS. A WITNESS. A BODY. [SIGHING] I DON'T HAVE ANY OF THAT. THEN GET ME A CONFESSION. [JASON]: IF LOGAN WASN'T AT COMPUTER CAMP, I'D ASK HIM TO JOIN US. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE BOTH AVAILABLE. THE SATURDAY AFTER THIS? THAT'S RIGHT. I WANT TO TAKE YOU AND YOUR MOM OUT TO CELEBRATE OUR WEDDING ANNIVERSARY. ISN'T YOUR ANNIVERSARY THIS WEEKEND? I'VE GOT CLIENTS COMING INTO TOWN AND I TOTALLY FORGOT. YOUR MOTHER, THANKFULLY, WAS VERY UNDERSTANDING. MM, I WASN'T SO UNDERSTANDING UNTIL HE APOLOGIZED PROFUSELY AND SENT ME FLOWERS. WOW, MOM REALLY IS RIGHT. ABOUT? SHE SAID, FOR A RELATIONSHIP TO WORK, YOU HAVE TO OVERLOOK A LOT OF THINGS. THAT'S GOOD ADVICE. NOW, CAN I GET THE POTATOES, PLEASE? HERE YOU GO, DAD. -THANKS. -NO PROBLEM. YOU HAVE A GOOD DAY. MORE TIRE PROBLEMS? NO. I'VE MADE SOME PROGRESS, BUT LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION FIRST, IF I MAY. SHOOT. YOU NEVER MARRIED, RIGHT? THAT'S RIGHT. AFTER CHARLES, NEITHER DID HELEN. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT. I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER IF HELEN MARRIED CHARLES OUT OF FAMILY EXPECTATIONS, BUT WAS REALLY IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE ELSE... AND THAT SOMEONE ELSE WAS IN LOVE WITH HER, TOO. GO ON. THAT SOMEONE, LET'S CALL HIM "JACK," MET HELEN AND CHARLES IN THE BACK OF THE RECEPTION HALL. WORDS WERE SPOKEN, TRUTHS CAME OUT, AND THE ARGUMENT MOVED TO THE STORAGE ROOM... AND IN A JEALOUS RAGE, "JACK" GRABBED A KNIFE IN THERE, NEVER INTENDING ON KILLING ANYONE, BUT THINGS GOT OUT OF HAND. THE BODY WAS SHOVED IN A CABINET, THE KNIFE WAS WRAPPED IN A CLOTH NAPKIN... SAFELY HIDDEN IN A DISCREET POCKET INSIDE OF HELEN'S WEDDING DRESS. SO YOU'RE SERIOUSLY SUGGESTING THAT HELEN CARTER WITNESSED A MURDER AND DIDN'T SAY A WORD? OUT OF ALL THE POSSIBILITIES, THIS IS THE ONE THAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE. HERE IS THE POCKET FROM THE WEDDING DRESS, AND THOSE ARE BLOOD STAINS. "O"-NEGATIVE, NOT COMMON. CHARLES'S TYPE. IF HELEN TOOK THAT KNIFE, THAT MAKES HER AN ACCESSORY, AND THERE IS NO STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ON MURDER. SO... WHAT, YOU'RE GONNA DESTROY HER LIFE? AFTER ALL THE PEOPLE SHE'S HELPED AND CONTINUES TO HELP, AND AFTER ALL THE GOOD SHE'S DONE? BECAUSE THE "MYSTERY" ABOUT A GUY WHO DISAPPEARED 35 YEARS AGO IS JUST SOMETHING YOU WANT TO "SOLVE?" NO, I DON'T WANT TO DESTROY HER LIFE. I THINK THAT HELEN WAS STUNNED BY WHAT HAPPENED. I THINK "JACK" TOLD HER TO TAKE THE KNIFE, AND SHE DID. AND I THINK IF "JACK" CAME FORWARD AND TOLD THE TRUTH, IT WOULD FREE HELEN OF A TERRIBLE BURDEN SHE'S BEEN CARRYING ALL THESE YEARS. THEY SAY CONFESSION IS GOOD FOR THE SOUL. [♪♪♪] HEY. HI. I'M KIND OF SURPRISED YOU WANTED TO MEET HERE. AM I GONNA LIKE THIS? THAT DEPENDS. I THINK YOU SHOULD GO TO CHINA. YOU WANT ME TO GO? YOU WANT TO GO. I DON'T KNOW ANYMORE. DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IF YOU DON'T GO? WHAT? I'M ALWAYS GONNA BE THAT PERSON THAT KEPT YOU FROM THAT GREAT ADVENTURE. [♪♪♪] NOW... WHAT DO YOU RECOMMEND? AND SOMETHING NOT SO SPICY THIS TIME. [♪♪♪] I DIDN'T SAY IT DIRECTLY, BUT I WAS PRETTY CLEAR-- I THINK HE KILLED CHARLES. WELL, HOW DID HE REACT? [STAMMERS] HE WAS MORE CONCERNED ABOUT HELEN BEING DRAGGED INTO THE WHOLE THING. HMM. [PHONE BUZZES] OH, IT'S DETECTIVE LYNWOOD. TED THOMPSON JUST TURNED HIMSELF IN. THE GUYS WALKS IN. I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE. -FRANK! -WHAT? HE WANTS TO MAKE A CONFESSION. -HUH! -YEAH. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DID IT, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE WE MAY HAVE FOUND AN ANSWER TO A 35-YEAR-OLD CRIME. [TED, OVER SPEAKER]: YEAH, WE WERE IN LOVE... BUT WE NEVER ACTED ON IT. I MEAN, WE COULDN'T. UH... I WAS THE SON OF A GARDENER, AND BOTH FAMILIES KNEW THAT... HELEN AND CHARLES WERE GONNA BE MARRIED, SO... WHAT HAPPENED ON THE DAY? THERE WAS THIS GIRL THAT I HAD DATED, AND-- NAME? UH, SARAH GORDON. SHE'S DECEASED NOW. ANYWAY, I HAD BROKEN UP WITH HER, AND SHE DID NOT TAKE IT WELL. SHE KNEW MY FEELINGS FOR HELEN, AND SHE KNEW THAT CHARLES AND I WERE BEST FRIENDS. TWO DAYS BEFORE THE WEDDING, WANTING TO HURT ME, SHE LIED TO CHARLES AND TOLD HIM THAT HELEN AND I WERE HAVING AN AFFAIR. OF COURSE, CHARLES WAS FURIOUS, BUT HE NEVER SAID ANYTHING TO HELEN OR ME. SO THE WEDDING WENT ON AS PLANNED, AND I COULD TELL THAT CHARLES WAS DISTANT, HE WAS COLD. AND THEN SARAH TOLD ME WHAT SHE HAD DONE. WELL, I TRIED TO TALK TO HIM. I MEAN, I WANTED TO STRAIGHTEN THINGS OUT, AND I TRIED TO DO IT BEFORE THE WEDDING, BUT HE-HE-HE... HE WOULDN'T TALK TO ME. SO, THEN I-I KNEW THAT RIGHT BEFORE THE RECEPTION... I'D BE ABLE TO GET HIM ALONE-- GET OUT OF HERE. I MEAN IT. WE ARE GOING TO TALK. I NEED TO EXPLAIN THIS. LEAVE NOW, OR I WILL-- IT'S NOT TRUE! DO YOU LOVE HER? [ROARS]: DO YOU LOVE HER? JUST LISTEN TO ME. -[THUD] -I WANT AN ANSWER! NOTHING HAPPENED. [RAGES] [TED CHOKING] [KNIFE PLUNGES] [THUD] [♪♪♪] AND, UH... I HAD TO HIDE THE KNIFE. [TWO RAPS ON DOOR] [♪♪♪] JUST BE A SECOND. [♪♪♪] I UNDERSTAND TED THOMPSON IS HERE TO MAKE A CONFESSION. YEAH. I CAN'T ALLOW IT. I KILLED MY HUSBAND. TED IS FULLY INNOCENT. [♪♪♪] WE WANTED TO COME IN FROM THE BACK TO SURPRISE EVERYONE. SO... WE WALKED FROM THE CHAPEL... TO THE BACK OF THE GUILD HALL... [♪♪♪] I FIXED MY MAKE-UP AND THEN I WENT OUT INTO THE HALL... AND CHARLES WASN'T THERE... AND I HEARD THIS ODD NOISE COMING FROM THE STORAGE ROOM. [HELEN GETS WEEPY]: CHARLES WAS CHOKING TED... HIS FACE WAS TURNING PURPLE. AND I-- CHARLES! I HIT HIM AND I-I PULLED HIM, AND HE WOULDN'T STOP. STOP! STOP! YOU'RE KILLING HIM! TED WAS DYING... I STABBED HIM. [GASPING AND CHOKING] STOP! [GASPING] [SOBBING] OH! TED WAS JUST... STARING AT ME. AND I... I HAD A STRANGE CLARITY OF WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE. I SAW THE CABINET AND I TOLD HIM TO HIDE THE BODY THERE, AND THEN I-- I REACHED FOR A NAPKIN, AND I REMOVED THE KNIFE, THEN HID THE KNIFE IN THE POCKET OF MY WEDDING DRESS. THEN I TOLD TED TO GO BACK INTO THE RECEPTION AND JUST ACT LIKE NOTHING HAD HAPPENED. PEOPLE WERE JUST GETTING SEATED, SO NO ONE WOULD KNOW IF HE HAD BEEN THERE OR NOT. I'D WAIT A FEW MINUTES, AND THEN I'D START LOOKING FOR CHARLES AS IF HE'D VANISHED. I WENT INTO THE BATHROOM, AND I REMEMBER LOOKING IN THE MIRROR AND SHAKING... AND THEN I WENT OUT AND I PLAYED MY PART. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE BODY? LATE THAT NIGHT, TED CAME BACK AND HE TOOK THE BODY, AND HE DROVE OUT TO SOME REMOTE WOODS AND BURIED IT. JUST BEFORE SUNRISE, WE MET AT A POND ON MY FAMILY'S ESTATE... AND WE AGREED THAT WE WOULD NEVER TALK AGAIN... NEVER SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN... AND WE HAVEN'T. I JUST SECLUDED MYSELF IN THE HOUSE AND I DIDN'T COME OUT FOR OVER A YEAR. [♪♪♪] FRANK HAD A LONG MEETING WITH THE D.A. HE TALKED TO HELEN AND TED SEPARATELY. THEY'RE BOTH STICKING TO THEIR STORIES. OBVIOUSLY, ONE OF 'EM'S LYING. LIE-DETECTOR TESTS FOR BOTH OF THEM TOMORROW. SO WHO'S THE KILLER? I DON'T KNOW. BUT WHAT BOTHERS ME IS... I REALLY LIKE BOTH OF THEM. [TESTER]: DID YOU HAVE A ROMANTIC ATTRACTION TO HELEN? YES. DID THIS RELATIONSHIP BECOME PHYSICAL? NO. DID YOU ARGUE WITH CHARLES IN THE BACK AREA OF THE RECEPTION HALL? YES. DID YOU KILL CHARLES CARTER WITH A KNIFE? YES. DID YOU HAVE A ROMANTIC ATTRACTION TO TED THOMPSON? YES. DID YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM BECOME PHYSICAL? JUST A KISS. JUST PRIOR TO THE RECEPTION, DID YOU WITNESS AN ALTERCATION BETWEEN CHARLES AND TED? YES. DID YOU FEAR FOR TED'S LIFE? YES. DID YOU KILL CHARLES CARTER WITH A KNIFE? YES. THANK YOU. I HAVE NO MORE QUESTIONS. FRANK! OHH... THAT WAS NOT FUN. JUST GOT OUT OF A LONG MEETING WITH THE D.A., POLYGRAPH EXAMINER AND ME. AND? TED IS LYING. HELEN WAS TELLING THE TRUTH ON ALL COUNTS. SO THAT MEANS... HELEN KILLED CHARLES CARTER. [EXHALES DEEPLY] WOW. YEAH. WHAT HAPPENS NOW? WELL, BECAUSE THERE WAS AN "IMMINENT THREAT TO THE LIFE OF ANOTHER," AND SHE HAD NO INTENT TO COMMIT VIOLENCE, IT'S CLEARLY A CASE OF JUSTIFIABLE HOMICIDE. SO, NO ARREST, NO TRIAL? THE REALITY IS, SHE ONLY ACTED TO SAVE A LIFE. NO CRIME. [RELIEVED SIGH] [♪♪♪] BUT WHAT ABOUT WITHHOLDING EVIDENCE? THAT'S A CRIME, RIGHT? OH, THE D.A. JUST WANTS TO PUT THIS BEHIND THEM. NO ONE WANTS TO SEE HELEN CARTER IN COURT. OH. -[BELLS JINGLING] -SEAN! JENN. MY SON WILL BE COMING IN TO SPEAK TO YOU LATER. I'M SORRY TO SAY HE SLASHED YOUR TIRE. HE'LL BE PAYING FOR THE DAMAGES OUT OF HIS EARNINGS. WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD HE DO THAT? HELEN WAS UPSET ABOUT YOUR INVESTIGATION, MATT OVERHEARD US TALKING, AND TOOK IT UPON HIMSELF TO TRY TO SCARE YOU OFF. I AM EMBARRASSED. PLEASE. I'LL ACCEPT HIS APOLOGY, BUT THIS IS NOT YOUR DOING. WELL, THANK YOU FOR THAT, BUT I FEEL RESPONSIBLE. MRS. CARTER WANTED ME TO DELIVER THIS. AND THANKS AGAIN FOR YOUR UNDERSTANDING. "IF POSSIBLE, "PLEASE JOIN ME FOR 4:00 TEA "AT THE CONSERVANCY. HELEN CARTER." [BIRDS CHIRPING] I-- WELL, WE-- WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE. IT WAS A TERRIBLE SECRET TO HAVE TO KEEP ALL THOSE YEARS. WHY DID YOU MARRY HIM IF YOU WEREN'T IN LOVE WITH HIM? WELL, SOMETIMES, MARRIAGE IS ABOUT MORE THAN LOVE. SOMETIMES IT'S ABOUT A FAMILY'S EXPECTATIONS AND A PERSON'S OBLIGATIONS, AND, YEAH, I DIDN'T MARRY CHARLES AGAINST MY WILL. I CARED FOR HIM AND I RESPECTED HIM. BUT YOU DIDN'T LOVE HIM. I WOULD HAVE DONE MY VERY BEST TO MAKE IT WORK. YOU KNOW, IN RETROSPECT, WE SHOULD'VE TOLD THE TRUTH AND FACED THE CONSEQUENCES, BUT, UM... WE PANICKED. YOU KNOW, DETECTIVE LYNWOOD SAID THAT YOU WERE VERY GOOD AT SOLVING MYSTERIES. OHH. BUT I THINK THE WORD IS... "EXTRAORDINARY." BUT I HAD IT ALL WRONG. WHAT MADE YOU THINK YOU COULD BEAT A LIE DETECTOR? I HAD TO TRY. TELL ME ABOUT THE POSTCARD. AH, A FRIEND WAS ON A CRUISE. I GOT HIM TO SEND IT. I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, MIGHT COME IN USEFUL SOMEHOW. AND YOU TWO HAVEN'T SPOKEN IN 35 YEARS? NEVER. WE HAVE SOME CATCHING UP TO DO. YOU KNOW WHAT? I LOVE WALKS. ME TOO. [CHUCKLES] JENNIFER, YOU WANT TO COME WITH US? OH, I THINK I WILL JUST FINISH MY TEA AND HEAD BACK TO WORK. [♪♪♪] YOU SEEM TO HAVE GOTTEN OVER IT. OH, I HAVEN'T GOTTEN OVER IT. I'M JUST NOT DWELLING ON IT. WELL, AT LEAST JASON REMEMBERED AND SENT YOU ROSES. YES, AND HE INVITED ME TO DINNER NEXT WEEK... WITH THE KIDS. WELL, WE'LL CELEBRATE YOUR ANNIVERSARY TONIGHT. THANK YOU. WE'LL HAVE FUN. A GIRLFRIEND OF MINE WANTED ME TO CHECK OUT A B&B FOR HER-- THE PRINCESS AND THE PEA. DO YOU MIND IF WE STOP IN ON THE WAY TO DINNER? OH, I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO GO THERE. MIGHT AS WELL BE WITH YOU. COME ON, MILADY. SHE'S JUST HAD SOME REALLY BAD EXPERIENCES AND DOESN'T TRUST THE ONLINE REVIEWS. OH, LOOKS PRETTY GOOD SO FAR! YEAH! LET'S CHECK OUT UPSTAIRS. OH, OKAY. THIS PLACE IS SO SWEET, ISN'T IT? YEAH. I COULD TOTALLY LIVE HERE. OH! THAT WOULD BE SO COOL! WE COULD HAVE LIKE A MURDER MYSTERY PARTY! [BOTH GASPING] WHAT DO YOU THINK? IT'S PERFECT. ARE YOU SURE THIS ROOM IS VACANT? THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID AT THE FRONT DESK. WAIT A MINUTE. THAT... THAT LOOKS LIKE MY-- THAT'S MY DRESS. IS IT? THAT'S FUNNY. [DANI LEAVES] [♪♪♪] I'VE HAD THIS BOOKED FOR TWO MONTHS. THERE ARE NO CLIENTS? NOPE. [SIGHS] OH... [LAUGHS] OH! YOU BETTER GET DRESSED. I'VE GOT A TABLE WAITING FOR US DOWNSTAIRS. OH, JASON. [CLINK] I SO GOT YOU. YOU DID. THE BEST ANNIVERSARY EVER. NOT YET. [MUSIC RISES] MAY I HAVE THIS DANCE? [♪♪♪]
