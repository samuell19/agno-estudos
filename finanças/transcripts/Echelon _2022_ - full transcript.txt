[♪] [Brewer] Where am I? [cloth ripping off] [Julia] Couple miles outside of Corp-Gov jurisdiction. [Giselle] Somewhere safe. What is this?! Release me immediately! [Brewer] Do you know who I am?! Michael Brewer. Born 2011, no children, widower... My condolences. [Julia] You've been employed by Wrightcorp since practically the beginning. Making nuclear energy innovations until transitioning into the development and commercialization of-- [violent coughing] [wheezing] Artificial gravity engines, which-- [continued coughing] Which brings us to your business with us. I'll have no business with you! Oh no? I don't do business with infected criminals! Rest assured, Mr. Brewer the infection in our lungs has not infected our business integrity. [rattling, wet cough] [whimpering inhale] [continued coughing] Between us, Mr. Brewer I think this might be her last business trip. [Brewer] Look, if it's ransom money you want the company's insurance policy will more than-- You can't buy what we want, Mr. Brewer. You can only take it. Who-- who are you? [Edgar] Who am I? I'm not that different from you, Mr. Brewer. We both serve a purpose. You serve a company; you're a company man. I serve the people. So, I guess that makes me a-- I guess that makes me a people person. Oh, god. Are you-- Are you People's Army? [Edgar] By stifling the voice of the "infected" as you call us. [Edgar] Wrightcorp has driven us toward desperation. And violence. In that way, I suppose your company has criminalized change. [Brewer] Look, I-- I-- I'm sorry for what's happened to you. To all of you. I-- I really am. But none of that is my fault. No. That's true. You're just a symptom of a much larger disease. But we have a cure for that. [Brewer] No, no, no no no no, no! Please! [Brewer] No no no, listen, I, I can't get-- Please! [Ramone] Shhhhhh... Your air is precious now. [mask peeling off] [air releasing] [sharp inhale] Now... I need to know where Wrightcorp is developing the new gravity free-gen tech. [EDGAR] The good compact stuff, you know what I'm talking about. [Edgar] So, Ramone here will hold on to your mask until you tell us. [Edgar] Now you have no voice. Now your every breath is precious. [Brewer] [sputters air] [Edgar] How much longer until you're the infected criminal? [hard exhale] Alright! [Brewer] There's a testing bunker under the building at 1038 Shine Street! Shine Street! 1038! They-- they store prototypes and compact systems in different stages of development. But you need special clearance! Who controls clearance? [Brewer] Grav-tech department heads and earth-bound security techs! Names, Michael! I need names. [heavy coughing] Larson! Howard Larson! Larson's the work-from-Earth CSO. [Brewer] He can generate keys and passes, whatever. He runs ground and orbital security operations from his compound on Earth. Look I-- I can help you! Just please give me my mask back, please! I-- I can't get A.C.H.E. Wright will take everything from me! [confused grunt] [Brewer] Oh no-- no no no no don't do-- No, don't do this! No look, I-- I'm worth more to you alive! [Brewer] [whimpering] Please.... no... [gunshot] [glitching noise] [♪] [glitching noise] [8-bit game noises] [alert chime] [digital button] [pistol slide] [urban neighborhood ambience] [distant sirens] [door slamming] [radio tuning static] Sportscaster] --got a hell of a show for you folks tonight The two-year running MVP Nick "The Iceman" Donovan will be joining us, remotely of course to discuss his short-lived but exceptional career as the premiere pitcher in the Infected Baseball League and what his failing health can teach other top-tier infected athletes about ACHE, and the impact that repeated outbreaks might have on their careers. Donovan made headlines in 2053 after his infected status meant he had to drop out of the MLB sparking controversy when-- [static] [Nova] This is Nova Grave, and thanks for tuning your auditory implants on tonight's edition of Graveyard Shift. [Graveyard Shift jingle intro] [spooky voice] Gra-a-a-aveyard Shift! [creepy voice] They're trying to cut me! [Nova] Anyway this morning I wake up, have a cup of coffee and start coughing blood out my nose. Nothin' new, I know, just another Tuesday in the good ol' U-S-of-ACHE. Except this time the blood's some thick, purple color so, you know, hell with it I figure I'll stop by one of those new Wrightcorp-sponsored health clinics before I get here to the studio to do the morning's 'Early Grave'. So they stick me with this newly infected doctor real piece of shit who tells me that my particular version of the Airborne Chronic Hemorrhagic Syndrome is the earliest recorded variant! [crowd cheering] [Nova] Meaning I am one of the O.G. recipients of humanity's favorite plague. And one of the last O.G.s still living. If you call life without a non-exposure license "living". [digital HUD noises] [Nova] Maybe they'll take me up to their fancy space station do some tests and I'll get to meet a fine, uninfected lady with a thing for full-body, airtight, rubber suits. [rubbing rubber noises] [digital warble] [radio program fades] [digital clicks] [door quietly opening] [careful bootsteps] [paper rustling] [match fizzling] [fire crackling] [door chime] [door slams] [distant clanging noise] [distant beeping] [clanging continues] [springy clanging] [happy game chime] [relieved exhale] [digital rustling] [more clanging] [gun clicks] [pinball noises] [mask velcro] [air releasing] [full exhale] [digital chime] [digital warbles] [Edgar] Ah, looks like you got in okay. You burn him? Yeah. [Edgar] Mmmm. Bet that smelled ripe. I-- I mean I wouldn't know. -Ah, right. I'm glad I don't have to wear one of those things on my face anymore. One of the benefits of having a debilitating lung infection. You people with your masks are missing all the smells of this brave new world. Okay, do we have login credentials? All we had was the housekeeper. And you. She doesn't know where he keeps his private stuff? Not that kind of housekeeper. [Edgar] Guess you're gonna have to work your magic. [rapid typing] How'd you get her to cooperate anyway? [Edgar] That's need-to-know. [James] Well, I 'need-to-know' if she's gonna tip off anybody at Wrightcorp. Her brother works for me. She's not gonna tell anyone anything-- Wait, she's infected?! [Edgar] No! Her brother has the aches... She doesn't. The house is clean. [Edgar] Look You don't know me yet. But you're gonna have to trust me if you wanna get paid. This is how I work. You'll get used to it. [deep exhale] Well what's wrong with this guy then? If he doesn't have A.C.H.E. then why's he gotta stay grounded? [Edgar] What do you mean? [James] I mean you'd think they'd house their security team on the space station. [scoff] Please. A one-bedroom apartment up there goes for a billion dollars. You think they're gonna give the real estate to house a keyboard monkey? -Hey. [Edgar] I'm just saying they outsource everything down here while they grow daffodils in artificial gravity and shit in golden toilets. [grunts] Yeah, kinda makes the wealth disparity between your people and my people pale in comparison, doesn't it? Sure. [hard keystroke] [access chime] And we're in. [Edgar] Cool. Look for anything confidential or classified. Wait. Hold on. Dude. This is a very sophisticated system, okay there's multiple firewalls, honeypots, subsystem dead-ends that-- The point is, I'm not going to make all that go away. It's gonna take days. Which... is enough time for somebody at Wrightcorp to notice a certain recently fired employee not doing his job. [Edgar] I'm guessing you have a plan for that. [blowing old USB] [USB snapping in] [access chime] Let's see if our friend Howard Larson [scoff] took a lot of selfies. [typing] [hard keystroke] [amused whine] [program working] [James] A stirring, in-memoriam montage for Howard Larson Adieu. [keystroke, beep] Hi there! This is Howard Larson! I just want everyone to know that I spent my life working for a spineless, wack-job multi-trillionaire who eats the poor for breakfast. I have no conscience. And, in death I am a traitor to my corporate overlords! [Edgar] You'd better not send that to anyone. What? And tarnish my spotless reputation? [key slam] [Edgar] [chuckling] There. I should be able to do all of Howard's busy work remotely now. No one will ask any questions. [Edgar] Good. Do his job, send us everything you can about-- Yeah yeah yeah yeah Station schematics, top secret projects personnel records. You'll have a full list of the various endangered caviar available on William Wright's executive lunch menu. You're a natural. I knew I did good hiring you. You're every bit as good as they said you were. I think... this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship. [gasp from inhaler] Y-- yeah. I-- I hope so. [chuckle] Well I'm gonna make myself at home here Edgar and I um-- Call you tomorrow. See you tomorrow kid. Good job. [transmission end chime] [hologram whoosh] [Grocer] What's my job? I feed hundreds of kids a day. I keep the engines runnin'. I keep the space station in orbit! [announcer] And Wrightcorp keeps making it possible. Since Wrightcorp was founded in 2043 the world's foremost energy conglomerate has expanded into nearly every global industry. Including national defense shipping, and even entertainment! Hi! I'm William Wright. Now the world has undoubtedly changed over the last decade. Fossil fuel shortage. Shifting climate. And a global health crisis. But the earth as it was still lives inside each and every one of us. In our hearts. In our hopes. In our sense of community. Our top scientists here on Wright Station are dedicated to providing reliable energy and cutting edge technology to our millions of customers living down on the planet's surface. And while we innovate we ask you to keep the world turning. Whether you're a privileged uninfected citizen or one of the millions of infected essential workers there is a place for you in a Wrightcorp Indentured Endeavor. By providing work opportunities universal housing and a standard basic income we have brought the unemployment rate down to nearly zero. So, from the lab tech in orbit to the essential worker on the ground... [scientist] I'm doing my part. [mechanic] I'm doing my part. [Grocer] I'm doing my part. [Wright] And that's... Doin' it Wright. [happy music] [happy logo chime] [cheerful notification] [double click] [window zapping open] God dammit, Howard, Wright is-- [Parsons] I'll say he's displeased. at the ambient noise in the security feed from Project A. It's gotta be the updated climate control. Add some post noise reduction to the video feed so he can watch his daughter. Or next time he flips out -I'll let him know it was your-- -Project A stupid cousin who installed the noisy-ass filtration system. Seriously! -Whoa. [Parsons] It's space! How bad do you have to screw up an installation for there to be too much ambient noise?! Fix it! [message zapping out] [distant engine noise] [pleasant morning alarm] [CARON] Good morning Miss Wright! Nooooooo! [CARON] The time is 9:45am. [Ayla] Hey CARON. [CARON] Miss Wright? Reset the clocks to... Dubai time. [pleasant chime] [CARON] The time is now 6:45pm. Oh, my! Productivity today has been significantly lower than previous days. Okay, CARON. [alarm claxons] [shrill buzzing and beeping] [violent whistling noise] [piercing alarm] Okay!! Shut up! [alarms stop] [CARON] Shall I play your rise-and-shine playlist? -No!

But some ACHES-positive Americans find the energy to supply all of the energy we use daily. [worker] Yeah it's rewarding, you know, working the plant. Cuz, I mean, without a non- exposure license there's not a lotta jobs I could get doin' whatever else. And here we're a family, like whenever the cough creeps up and someone needs time off needs extra shifts to pay for the hospital bills we're all real understanding of eachother. This job's our way of, uh, contributing, you know? It's rewarding.

[typing] Hello, onboard computer! Yes I would like remote access. Thank you for asking. [access chime] Credentials? I think we can arrange that. [access chime] O.S. control. No. Processes? Yep. [menu sounds] Wow. That program's eating a lot of memory. [rapid typing] [8-bit game theme music] "Worldsim." "Please create avatar account." What is this, some kind of game? Well, I wanna play. [determined typing] [access chime] [digital burst of sound] [over PA] [Symphony No. 4 in A Major, Op. 90 by Mendelssohn] Hello?! [distant explosion] [Mendelssohn continues closer] [James] Hello! [horrified shriek] [notebook slams] [digital error noises] [symphony rising] [symphony finale] Who the hell are you?! [James] Oh! [chuckle] Hi there. Sorry. I must have scared you, you tore your headset off. [laugh] Shut up. -Okay. [Ayla] What are you doing here? Answer me! I can talk now? Or--? [futuristic rifle cocking] [James] Ok! Alright. Well um... [James] Surprise! [chuckle] -What? -Happy belated birthday, Ayla! [Ayla] My birthday was two months ago. [James] Two months and eight days, yeah. Okay? [James] I guess time has no impact on a father's love. My father sent you? [James] In a sense, yes. This is a private network! [James] Correct, and that is why Mr. Wright had to authorize the installation. What installation? Me! The name's Darion. [bad Scottish accent] Just Darion. Heh. It's a-- Anyway I'm an artificially intelligent software. Repurposed and programmed to keep you company here within the, uh... 'Worldsim'! [chuckle] [mechanical engine ambience] [James] [laugh] [rifle activating] Follow. [Ayla] Now! [over PA] [Wilhelmj's "Air on the G String"] [Ayla] Bullshit. -Not bullshit. You don't act like a computer program. Well then I'd say somebody did a very good job. I've developed A.I. You don't fit the bill. -How's that? You're missing the "I". [James] Oh! Haha! Good one! [James] Well, I'm something of a rarity actually. I've been relegated to a normal, human cognitive wavelength and imprisoned here within your simulation. Yeah this whole simulation is sort of like robot jail for me. I guess I got a little out of control. Out of control? [James] But my memory banks were wiped after whatever happened so I have no recollection of the incident. [Ayla] Incident? -Mmhmm. But, like I said... [whooshing noise] [chuckle] Man... [James] You did all of this? Y-- yeah. Wow. [snort] I like the little wingdings. Why do you look like that? Look like what? [James] Well this avatar was just randomly assigned to me by my programming but, uh-- If you'd like I can take the shape of whatever your heart desires. Goat?! -But--! It is unlikely that I will be randomly assigned this particular avatar again, so... Eh. You can stay like that I guess. Awesome. So what is this supposed to be? What does it look like to you? Uh... Well, um... It's kinda got me thinking... I'm seeing a... I'm feeling. You know? Mmm. Yeah. [James] Mmmm. -That's what I was going for. -Oh. Good. [Ayla] It's the transition out of my blue period. [James] Right. Naturally. [Ayla] Honestly I haven't worked on any of this in awhile. Why, you've been working on your big dangerous engine thing? What are you really doing here?! -Your father assigned me the prestigious job of keeping you company-- -[mock buzzer] [Ayla] Wrong answer! Would you like to play again? Okay. My alternate functionality is [James] as a... security monitor. I knew it! [James] Yes, my charming personality and witty banter serve as a fluffy cushion surrounding my anti-malware and digital policing protocols. [Ayla] Policing! [sarcastic laugh] Well that's fun. Well hey, I think I deserve some credit though. -Yeah? Why's that? -I am programmed to lie to you about my functionality. Well that makes me feel so much better! [James] I just thought you deserved to know the truth. [Ayla] And how exactly are you able to circumvent your behavioral programming? I guess I'm a little fucked up. [scoffs] Yeah. I'd say so. K Bye. Oh! Uh... Well it has been a pleasure making your acquaintan-- [laser rifle arming] [James] --nnce. Okay. Wait! [Ayla] Where are you gonna be? [James] Oh I donno. Just around. I live here now so... [grinding digital transition] [surprised laugh] [James] And she's adorable! [Edgar] This is amazing. A little on the angry side but that's probably just cabin fever-- -This is exactly the kind of thing we're looking for. Now we can leverage this information-- -I know, I know I need to keep building trust, pick her brain for information-- -You talked to her?! You saw her picture of course I talked to her. [Edgar] What were you thinking?! If Wright gets wind of anything that we're doing we're done! -It's fine man! I've developed a solid alter ego. I'm basically like if James Bond was a phishing scam. [Edgar] The number of people relying on you not to fuck this up-- [James] [heavy sigh] Dude. Relax. [digital whoosh] She thinks I'm her imaginary friend. Besides I think you're gonna want in on this doohickey she's developing in her VR simulation. -Doohickey? Yeah. Looks like she's doing R&D on some engine prototype. Looks complicated. [Edgar] [ironic laugh] Must run in the family. Billy Wright is perpetually finding new ways to suck the energy from under us. Do you know how much fuel my drivers deliver to that goddamn station? -Uh... Fifty terrawatt hours of nuclear batteries and carbon biofuels every month? [Edgar] Yeah that's exactly right. I know! Dude I'm going through pages and pages of data in there man. -Of course. Wrightcorp is covering up so many flaws in its fuel storage and delivery protocols man, it... [James] It's vile. You're tellin' me. [James] What's it like handling fuel shuttle dispatch knowing that 30% of your employees develop acute radiation syndrome? You learn to be very convincing. [Edgar] You know what... I trust you with the Wright girl. You've been doing a good job so far and... I don't see any reason why you can't handle it your way. I appreciate that. [Edgar] I just have one question. What's that? Why are you helping us? Uhhh, because you offered to pay me six million dollars? [Edgar] Right, but... "Acheys"... killed your family. Yeah but... It's not like they meant to. And besides it's people like Wright that made infected citizens desperate enough to ignore quarantine protocols and riot, so... [James] You wanna rob him? Be my guest. I'm happy I can use my non- exposure privilege to help out essential workers and ya know-- people with A.C.H.E. Money's nice too. Money's very nice. Well... It's nice to have you on board. [end-transmission chime] [engine ambience] [digital error noise] [digital error noises] [repeated error noises] [slamming keys] [hefty smack] [computer calculating] [sad failure noise] [perforated paper tearing] [James] "I am the only being whose doom--!" [Ayla] Jesus Christ! [James] You have an Emily Bronte poem graffitied in your art mausoleum. I'm aware. Thank you! [James] That part of your blue period? Ah, that was my Heathcliff phase. [James] I don't get it. Wuthering Heights? [James] Gesundheit! [James] "I am the only being whose doom No tongue would ask, no eye would mourn I never caused a thought of gloom A smile of joy since I was born." What, do you have this memorized?! Uh, yeah. I have lots of stuff memorized. [Ayla] Well, I am not about to take literary criticism from a, um... glorified firewall. [scoff] Come on! I like it! It's misanthropic, depressing-- Emo. Don't worry I've moved out of my teenage years. Man... How long have you been up here? Ummm... I was eleven when I first collapsed. and everybody thought that I had gravity sickness, and then I was in and out of the hospital until I was thirteen? And that's when they discovered that I have a rare allergy to the hybrid plants they use to filter the air on the main station. Oooooh. Damn. Yeah. So rather than have me spend my eighth grade with my lungs on fire My dad decided to invest in a, um remote facility. [James] So eighth grade... well, you know... at least you got out before your awkward phase. [emphatic snorting] [James] [laughing] [Ayla] [giggling] [James] [continued laughter] [subtle chime] [CARON] Miss Wright you have an incoming call from Wright Station. [cheerful ringtone] [ringtone continues] [confirmation beep] [electrical whirring] [hologram zaps to life] [Ayla] Hey Dad! Nice sweater. [Ayla] Oh yeah? You like it? It's just some, uh... space garbage that floated in. Expensive space garbage. Like me. [Wright] [hearty laugh] And what has my favorite space garbage been up to today? Ahhh, the usual. Pacing back and forth. Sitting. I argued with CARON for a bit. [chuckle] [Wright] Ahhh, busy day. Well you haven't sent me a new composition in a long time. Does the music interest you anymore? Or the painting? -Eh. -I can upload you a new module for whatever hobby you like. Yeah. I know you can. And he's kind of become a pain in my ass. [Wright] What? [watch beeping] Nevermind. I know it's for my own good. I totally understand. I'll let you know if I need anything, okay? Promise? [Ayla] Promise. Okay. Hey guess what I brought. What? [childish game music] Oh, no way!! [8-bit game noises] Are you sure? Do you... have time to be completely destroyed today? Please. Alright, come on. Give me a question. You ready? -Yeah. What is the atomic mass of Triton? [Ayla] Come on! I thought you were going to upload a harder deck this time. 3.015501 [sad 8-bit tone] [Ayla] Seriously this is easy. [cheerful tone] Are you ready? -Yeah. -How many moons orbit the exoplanet of Z5Q13 -That's the one with-- -[mocking] Uuhhhh-- No hints! 14. Nice try. It is. -No it's not. -It is! It's not! It's 15!! Ha-HAA! [Wright] They don't count that one as a moon. [Ayla] They do! -That's not a moon. -It's a moon. [James] No, I'm talking about an isolated docking bay connected to the pod where Daddy sends her gifts food, whatever. [Edgar] Why didn't I know about this? I don't remember delivering anything to a remote satellite. He's probably using a private courier from the main station. He plays everything with her pretty close to the chest. Hell, for all I know I might be the only person that has access to her remote monitoring systems. -This is very interesting. [James] I know. [James] So I had a thought. Okay. -And this is just me thinking out loud here. [Edgar] You usually do. What if we sent her a package? -Like a scented candle? [James] Mmmm. I was thinking more like... remote access software? What if we planted a rootkit? Okay, that's not bad. [Edgar] In that case I need you to run an errand for us. What, you mean like leave the house? Yes. [toaster dinging] Fuck. Okay, what? [Edgar] I need you to run over to a Sani-Trade. [incredulous laugh] Oh come on man that's not still a thing. Wrightcorp scrapped all of its sanitation purchasing proxies years ago. There's no unauthorized trade between infected and uninfected citizens. -The black market didn't disappear just because the government said so. Trust me. It's still a thing. [defeated sigh] Alright, where am I goin? I'm sending you the address right now. [fork slamming] [rooster crowing] [chorus of creepy voices] [sleepy, creepy voice] Early Grave! [creepy voice] They're trying to cut me! [Nova] Y'all, I been smacked by beat cops and beat by smackhounds. I been slapped by a hooker and kicked by my own mama. I spent years gettin' stabbed and shot at runnin' with all kinds of shady characters. Nova Grave has been around the block a few damn times. So believe me when I tell y'all that I ain't never seen a single one of these anti-corporate militant socialist 'People's Army' yahoos the mainstream corpo media is always goin' on about. They do not exist. The People's Army graffiti? Corporate scare tactics. People's Army bombings? Planned demolitions. The Eastern Autonomous Zone?! Shit, y'all that's just a place for the corp-gov city police to dump bodies without havin' to file any paperwork. I hate to be a downer folks but the people have no army. There's no one comin' to save us, folks. And on that cheery note let's get back to the music. [jazzy music] [outgoing dial tone] [receiver clicks] [Edgar] What?! [James] Why are you sending me to a residential district? [Edgar] Most of the houses are abandoned. It's the perfect place to run a middleman service like this. There's a Sani-Trade vending machine hidden in the backyard. Infected delivery personnel load the machine from underground and transactions are handled by Black Market Buddha. [James] "Black Market Buddha"? [Edgar] It's the moniker for the vending A.I. [James] Sounds offensive. [Edgar] Seems like it would be [chuckling] but the machine's programming is faulty and it insists. He's... manageably insane. [digital warble] [jazzy music fades] [digital clicks] [wind chimes] [airy button sound] [mechanisms activate within] [welcoming startup theme] [Buddha][British] Have you come for spiritual enlightenment? [James] Uh, no. No. Electronics. [Buddha][British] Well, you never know what you might find when you're looking in all the wrong places. This isn't a Wrightcorp-run Sanitrade proxy, is it? I-- [violent mechanical failure] [Buddha][Demonic] Down with Wrightcorp! Anarchy! Anarchy!! [glitchy transformation] [Buddha][British] [clears throat] Pardon me. No no. This facility has been salvaged and repurposed. And is now under the management of a rather different organization. That's good. [nervous chuckle] [Buddha][Cockney] You cheeky bastard. Okay. Um... You sell electronics though don't you? [Buddha][Scottish] Of course we sell electronics! Who's askin?! Oh! I'm sorry. Uh-- Edgar! Edgar sent me. [Buddha][British] Oh yes Edgar! One of our very best clients. Do send him our best. [polite chuckle] I will. Thanks. Umm... So anyway I need three variable-connect Spydir-class remote patch units. [Buddha][Cockney] And why do you need three variable-connect Spydir-class remote patch units? Uh-- because Edgar needs them. [Buddha][Cockney] Nooo but why do you need three variable-connect Spydir-class remote patch units? For Edgar. I'm sorry I don't think I understand the question. [Buddha][British] My dear boy, the man who embraces the leash will one day find that he is no more than a dog. Uh, well I have no idea what that means. But thank you for the insight. [Buddha][Cockney] [guffaw] Woof!! [labored sigh] Okay. Listen, Edgar needs the three Spydir units. I can't have them mailed to my current address and this is the only place that I can buy black market tech without risking exposing myself to ACHE and coughing up blood until I die, so-- [Buddha][Scottish] Ah, don't worry! If you catch ACHE you'll only probably cough up blood until you die! [hearty guffaw] [polite, tired guffaw] I'll pass. So, um... Spy.dir units? [confirmation tune] [object dispensing] [Buddha][British] Product sanitized. [Buddha][Scottish] Well are ya gonna grab the thing or ain't ya? -Oh, uh. Yeah. [heavy drawer opening] [devices rattle] [mechanical whirring] [object drops] Cute. Thank you. [shutdown tune] Yum yum. [lamp clanging] Ahh! [defeated sigh] [massive door slamming] [digital zapping] Ayla?! [birds and cicadas chirp] [digital whoosh] [another digital whoosh] Uh... okay. [Ayla] Ten... [James] Ten what? [Ayla] Nine... Eight... -Is this some kind of game? Yes. Seven... What if I die or get erased or-- -You won't. Six... -How do you know? -I programmed it that way. Five... [Ayla] Four... Okay well what am I supposed to-- am I-- [Ayla] Three... [gun charging] AYLA: Two, one!! [laser gunshot] [digital zapping] JAMES: [gasp] Hey!! Come on!! [Ayla] [imitating bird] Cuh-caw! [distant laser shot] [shot collision] [Ayla] Where would you want to live? If you were a real boy? Mmm. Probably Wright Station. Oh god! Why? I don't know. It's safe. There's good air. Nobody's sick. It's really bad isn't it? I'm really lucky. Well, you're a good person, you deserve good things. -It's easy to be good when nothing bad has ever happened to you. [James] Well... In my experience there aren't an overabundance of good people. So-- -Well I'm sure that optimism isn't exactly a useful tool for a security system. Touché [Ayla] People change when they're scared. I mean, I haven't lived down there. All the history of the world I've learned from lessons on a screen. which I'm sure has been colored by some perspective. But I'd imagine that in addition to having a chronic, life-threatening illness... it would be crushing to live in a world where you are told where to go what job you can do, who you can see, where everything that you do is restricted to a bunch of zones based off a diagnosis that has labeled you for life. I've spent a lot of time up here by myself. And when I first got here I spent most of my time doing things for myself. Painting. Composing. Playing video games. Dabbling in poetry. [Ayla] But after awhile doing all those things for myself just made me feel way more isolated. I stare down at that huge, wide world this massive society that doesn't even know I exist and I want to do something. Something good. I have the time. I have the resources... I wish more people were like you. [James] [sniff] Where would you wanna live? I don't know. Not Wright Station. [soft computer alert] [soft chime] [glitchy disconnect] [media removal alert] [digital startup noise] [digital keystrokes] [dial tone] [call connecting] [James] Okay the Spy.dir I'm sending should allow you remote access to Ayla's pod. You'll have full control so, you know, you can gather whatever information you want. [Edgar] Great. Bring the devices pre-programmed to Black Market Buddha. And... on the way, I need you to do another job for me. [digital window opening] [James] Whoa whoa whoa, why am I doing this? [Edgar] You're the only asset that we have with a non-exposure license. None of my people can even enter the district much less the building. [James] Right, but... why? [Edgar] Because there's another two million in it for you? [James] [labored sigh] [Edgar] What's going on with you? Why are you suddenly asking questions? -I thought you trusted me, man. -I do trust you, James. [Edgar] I'm just trying to protect you. [James] Yeah. Woof. [Edgar] Sorry what was that? [James] Nothing. [Edgar] Right. Do your thing, get in and take the elevator to the lowest level. You'll need priority clearance to access the testing bunker underneath the building. [James] Ok, and what are they testing exactly? -Need-to-know. -Of course. [Edgar] Our guy inside was able to leave the package for you. It's located on one of the weapons testing platforms. [James] Oh sure, that's a safe place to leave it. [Edgar] Shouldn't be hard to find. Grab it, and bring it to Black Market Buddha. [door unlocks] [Edgar] And don't drop it. [A.I. voice assistant][over PA] Welcome, employee number 15768! Andrew Garnet! This week's most valuable employee! [elevator dings] [shoes scuffling] [case unsealing] [air releasing] Whoa. [door slamming] [footsteps] Hi. Uh, hi? Who are you? Uhh... Andrew Garnet. Physics technician. Employee number 157-- [Man] Mmm. No you're not. I'm not? [Garnet] I'm Andrew Garnet. Oh. Yeeeeeah. oh... [sheepish chuckle] [case slamming] [Garnet] Hey!! [intense scuffling] [cloth ruffling] [intense pull] [missed swing] whoosh! [Garnet] [grunt] [James] No, no no! Alright! Okay! Okay! Okay! Hey hey hey! You're right! You're right! Here. You're right. Here you go. [plastic slamming] [James] Agh! [case hitting concrete] [Garnet] AHHHH! [Garnet] Agh! [head colliding with mask] [air pressure releasing] [metal clicking] [pistol slide cocking] [James] Box. Do you know what this is? Uh... Yeah it's a-- [Garnet] It's a compact gravitational matter condenser prototype. Yeah. Right... Obviously. Who do you work for? Ooooh. Ya know honestly I kinda consider myself an independent contractor, Andrew. Just... gimme the grav-- Gimme the gravity thing. You're not gonna shoot me. I will too shoot you! -No you won't. -Yes I will. You don't even know how to fight. [intense scoff] Look who's talking! [Garnet] Listen... I can't let you leave here with this. Look just tell them I came in here guns blazing overpowered you and took off. I'll tie you to a chair or something! Look I'm sure your corporate overlords will understand. No. They won't. I could lose everything. My job, my pension my insurance. Oh?! You get insurance?? [Garnet] They can come after my family... What? [Garnet] It's not unheard of. There have been stories. Jesus, man. And these are the kind of people you're gonna take a bullet for? Listen, it's not just them. It's this. This is not a toy. Yeah. I'm well aware. [Garnet] No you don't seem very aware! If this thing is activated under the wrong circumstances it could implode a city block! Really? [Garnet] Really. But it won't hurt anyone if it stays in the right hands. [scoff] Yeah. And those hands would be Wrightcorp's? Look... either way it's my job to fetch that box and one way or another I'm leaving with it. [James] You really wanna take advantage of that WrightTech insurance policy just to protect a piece of corporate hardware? Come on, man. No. Alright. [digital keystrokes] What are you doing? [intense digital glitch] [Garnet] Ahhhh! Ahhh! [painful groans] [brutal hit] [Garnet] Ahhh! Just because you don't pull the trigger doesn't mean your hands are clean! [painful exhale] [massive door opening] [wind chimes] [airy digital button] [startup tune] [Buddha][Scottish] Well, it's good to see ya James! I hope you've had a pleasant evening! I have. Thank you. I think I made a new friend. [success chime] [Buddha][British] Walking with a friend in the dark is better than walking alone in the light. [chuckling] yeah. Woof woof. [Buddha][British] Mm. Yes. Well said, sir. [James] Here's our... first transaction. Programmed spy.dir unit. [heavy drawer closing] [Buddha][British] Transaction received. Would you like a receipt? -Uh, no. Thank you. [mechanism ingesting transaction] [James] What does Edgar want with this? [Buddha][Cockney] Oh, well, I don't even know what that is, sir. -It's a... uh... rapid gravity condenser. [Buddha][Cockney] Mmmmmm. Sounds like fun! Why do you work for Edgar? [Buddha][Scottish] Oh, Buddha doesn't work for the People's Army! Buddha works for himself! [chuckle] Good for you. Wait, what?! [Buddha][British] I run this kiosk as an independent A.I. all are welcome to my services so long as they-- No, no no. Shut up. Go back. What about the People's Army? [Buddha][Demonic] The People's Army! Rescuing the status quo of tomorrow!! [James] Edgar's with the People's Army?! [Buddha][Cockney] Oopsie. They're a terrorist organization! [Buddha][Scottish] Well, one man's terror is another man's revolution. Do you have safe deposit? [Buddha][Scottish] Does a one-legged duck swim in a circle? I need you to put into a separate account. [Buddha][British] Very well. Under what name? Darion. [Buddha][Cockney] Alrighty then. [heavy drawer closing] [transaction ingesting within] [Buddha][Cockney] Thank you for your business! [success chime] [digital warble] [Buddha][British] Friendship is the only cure for hatred and the only guarantee of peace. [shutdown tune] [♪] [dial tone] [dial tone continues] [answering machine] No one is available to take your call. Please leave a message. [beep] Yeah, Edgar, we need to have a talk about that extra job you just sent me on. Call me back. [digital clicks] [digital error alerts] [loud thud] [locking noise] [success chime] [surprised gasp] [success chimes beeping] [machine whirring] [charging up] [machine charging continues] [machine beeping] [tremendous explosion] [digital fire crackles] [digital buzzing glitches] [James] That was awesome! [Ayla] Fuck. [James] So what is that, anyway? [Ayla] It's supposed to be a fusion reactor. [success chime] [James] Oh. A what? [Ayla] [amused snicker] [Ayla] It's fine. I mean it just would mean free clean energy for all of mankind. [James] Why don't you just ask your dad for a lab? -Eeehh... -Like an honest-to-god laboratory module? What is going on there? [Ayla] What? Between you and your dad. [Ayla] Nothing. He is the father of the century everybody knows that. Except nobody knows that because nobody knows that I exist unless he wants them to. And your mom? [Ayla] I could have been a test tube baby for all I know. That would explain so much! [insulted scoff] Shut up! [James] [guffaw] [♪] [foliage rustling] [laser blast] [laser whizzing by] [laser pistol shots] [headshot thud] [The Last Man on Earth (1964)] [Price] All of you! All of you, freaks! Mutations! [suspenseful music] [spear hitting gut] [Price] [gasp] -Oh, shit! [Ayla] [laugh] [Price] You're freaks! [Price] I'm a man! The last... man. [body collapsing] [Ruth] Robert! [Price] They were afraid of me. They were afraid of me. They were afraid of me. [Ruth] They didn't know. [dramatic death score] [Ayla] Can I ask you a question? [James] Uh... yeah. Anything. [Ayla] When... you were repurposed after your "incident"... they unplugged you, right? Like... they killed you? [Ayla] You died? Yeah. I mean, I guess. Sure. What was that like? [nervous laugh] I-- I don't know how to describe it, um... Ah-- I guess I'll have to get back to you? Oh, okay. K... [♪] Can you feel that? It's not just me? You-- you feel it too?! -Oh, um... I meant physically. The... Oh, the... the actual-- No. Dang. [chuckle] I, um... I've never kissed anyone before. Oh! Well, uh... Still haven't! [nervous laugh] Right... [heavy spaceship passing] [♪] [heavy door opening] [pressure releasing] [door clanging] [garbage flushed out] [James] [over PA] Ayla? Darion?! CARON are you messing with me?! [James] No, uh... I actually gave your charming, repurposed accounting software the night off. I hope that's okay? I'll allow it. [James] It's just that I thought of an answer to your question from earlier. About... you know, what it feels like to be deactivated. Oh, yeah! [James] Well... I don't think being unplugged is the same as what you would experience. I mean I've been rebooted and repurposed countless times. It sort of loses its novelty after awhile. -Oh, okay. [James] But there's a lot of stuff rolling around in my head from previous jobs that I've been put to and I do have one outstanding memory from my time as a footage irregularity monitor for a hospital security system. Footage irregularity monitor? [James] Yeah... You know some A.I.s can be use to sabotage or fake security footage so another A.I. has to be put in place in order to-- Got it. [chuckle] -Right. [James] Anyway... I have a memory. A... fragmented memory from that job of a young man Twenty-something maybe? The dossier I got from his face scan showed that he'd already watched his father and sister die from ACHE complications in the same hospital that week. -Jesus... [James] And I watched as he was talking to his mother remotely. Just like the rest of his famiy she had to be quarantined. So anyway he's talking to her from a computer in the waiting room. And I remember this kid watching his mother the last member of his family die. [James] He told her I'm scared, Mom. I don't want you to go. And she said... [sigh] Her vocal cords sounded like razor blades, but... She said, "I'm scared too James." And I don't want to go either. But I know it's not me that's going. All that I am is all that I've done here on this planet. I always wanted to leave this place better than I found it and when I leave you behind... I leave you behind. And I can rest easy knowing that. I hope she can. I love you, Darion. I love you, too. [sniff] [incoming ringtone] [ringtone continues] [digital beep] Hello? [Edgar] [violent coughing] Don't you ever... I mean don't you ever talk to me like you're the one in charge! What?! If I tell you to do a job then you'd better finish it. You put the box in the machine! There is nothing to discuss! Who do you think you are?! I think I'm the guy who's doing everything for you, so-- [Edgar] You're a gifted guy, but there's a hundred people talented as you who would bend over backward to do the work I handed you. -Okay. Look-- [Edgar] And for what I'm paying you, you prick... So I send you on an errand, you do it! An errand?! I could've been thrown in prison with acheys and had my rights stripped away! [Edgar] Oh, cry me a river. -So I can put weapons in the hands of terrorists?! Huh?! [Edgar] [heavy breathing] [violent coughing] [choking sounds] You sound like shit. Thanks. [James] You okay? [Edgar] Yeah, I'll be fine. Look you'll get your money and then some. Just hand over the gravity condenser. [Edgar] Besides, I have another job for you. No I'm not doin' another job for you. [Edgar] Stop the hardball shit, kid, you're not good at it. Besides, all you have to do is not do something. What are you talking about? We're gonna ground the girl. Ground her?! -Think about the payday when we ransom her. No. No. That was not part of the plan. Oh no? What was the plan, then? [James] I don't know, you said you wanted to steal from Wright! Like a heist or something! [Edgar] And you practically bagged her up and brought her to us. [Edgar] Once the Spy.dir arrives at her pod we'll have remote access. We can land her wherever we want. [James] No, that pod wasn't designed for that, okay? [Edgar] No, but it was designed to keep her safe and that's all we want. [Edgar] We'll rescue her safe and sound from the crash site and you're not gonna tell her a thing. for both your sakes. [James] No, you can't do this. [Edgar] Why? [James] Because she-- she's working on a-- a, a thing. [Edgar] You'll have to be more specific... She's building a fusion engine, okay?! [James] She's working on a prototype for-- She's trying to make things better for people down here!! I'm trying to make things better for people down here! We're trying to make things better! She's a Wright, James! Okay, look... I didn't get into this to hurt people, okay? That's not me. [Edgar] Well that's the burden of privilege, Jimmy. [incoming ringtone] You never learn to get your hands dirty. [digital chime] Honey! I thought I told you not to call me on this number unless it was an emergency! -I've done it! -Done what? -I got the simulation to stabilize. Real world tech and physics! What? I've built a working fusion engine! I don't think so, darling. I sent you the tests! [glasses activating] [digital startup sounds] [interactive noises] [Ayla] So? What do you think? [Wright] Darling, I-- This is incredible. You did this? I did. [Wright] But how did you-- [Ayla] Well I had access to all the company's research up until we stopped working on the project in '54. So I just transferred everything to my Worldsim program. I didn't realize we were this close before I decided to pull the project. [Ayla] What? We can't show anybody this but I am proud of you. -Well obviously we can't share it with anybody yet, but-- [Wright] I love you and you have to know I am so proud of you. Look... I understand that it's too important to go into production based off of some sims, but if we patent this process and we prove that it works on the ground in real life then we actually have a chance of moving forward with-- The problem is not your engine, darling. The problem is people-- [♪] [error chime] Your mother always thought of our company as trying to win some victory for all of creation. She loved people. Often I'm glad she passed when she did. [Wright] Before Earth became what it is today. Before people showed their true colors. [Wright] But it's beautiful seeing that same naive look in your eyes. Dad people are just fighting to live down there. You can't paint everybody with the same brush! Honey, you just don't know. -I do! Darion told me! He told me all about the suffering. About how hard it was at the-- -Wait, wait wait wait. Who's "Darion"? The A.I. [Wright] Your A.I. is CARON. [Ayla] No! The-- The gift you sent me. The A.I. that you embedded in my simulation? [Ayla] The security monitor! -Honey, have you been talking to someone inside of your game? It's a private network. No one should be able to-- No I know but he said that you-- -If you've been interacting with an outside user inside your game, I have to disable your account. And I need to wipe the entire network! No! Dad! You can't do that! I will lose everything! Well I can't lose you! I'll call you later. [disconnect chime] [Ayla] No, Wait!! [login chime] [digital noises] [♪] Ayla! Ayla, where are you?! Come on, Ayla, we don't have time for games right now! It's important! Ayla, you need to-- [gunshot] Agh! [digital zapping] Ayla! You are not safe here! I certainly don't feel safe. -There are people coming for you. You have to listen to me! I don't have to do a god damn thing you tell me to do. [laser gunshot] [fleshy impact] [creeping digital glitches] [door creaking] [loud bootsteps] [creepy digital glitches] [♪] [glitching intensifies] [eerie digital noises] [Ayla] It's gone. My father deleted everything. [creeping digital glitches] You took everything from me!! [zapping zounds] [fleshy digital glitches] [glitching intensifies] [Ayla] Nooooo!! [VR headset alarms] CARON... ... give me access to my Worldsim! Now! [CARON] I'm sorry. Your login credentials are no longer valid, Miss Wright. [Ayla] [guttural roar] [CARON] Is there anything else I can assist you with? [James] [over PA] Ayla? [Ayla] [roaring] No!! Go away! CARON, disable the PA system! Turn it off! [James] I turned off CARON Ayla. -Go away!! [James] Ayla, your pod has been compromised. I need you to help me stop them. -Stop who? -There's people coming for you They have remote access to you satellite. How? [James] I'm sorry, Ayla. -Listen to me-- -Go away! [James] I didn't know who I was working for I can still -Go away! stop them if you help me. -I hate you! I need you to look around for a small device. It could -I hate you! I hate you! I-- [James] Probably won't matter if we disable it, but if we don't do something, they're gonna-- [glitches] going to allow them access to navigation they're going to be able to control your home remotely and-- [glitching out] -What?! [James] [unintelligible glitches] Darion? Darion? [whimper] [guttural screech] [silence] [James] [whispered] Oh, come on.

I'm gonna kill you. [Edgar] And how are you going to do that? You don't know where we are. You don't have a plan. You can't do anything by yourself. I trusted you! [Edgar] I trusted you. We trusted you. While you were off in wondersim playing peekaboo with your pretend girlfriend. You saw all that? [Edgar] Shouldn't be that surprised. You gave us full access. This was all your plan. You're gonna hurt her aren't you? [Edgar] Not if Wright cooperates. While he's busy firing all his private security and building new firewalls, we'll land her pod on Earth and arrange a trade. -No, Edgar, I told you that pod was not designed to reenter the atmosphere! [Edgar] She'll get to Earth one way or another. This girl is more than a payday, Edgar, okay?! She's important! [Edgar] She's up in a pod in fucking space playing a video game while billions of people rot beneath her in an apocalyptic soup. You have nothing in common with her, James. Why don't you join us down here in reality? Your future is here where millions of people are starving and suffering and dying for change. You're not gonna choose your own self-interest over peoples' lives. [James] I am not the one acting own self-interest. Helping Ayla would create real, lasting change. Her engine could basically provide free energy for everyone. It would upend Wrightcorp entirely! You could save every single one of your employees from getting radiation sickness, but instead you're gonna choose petty retaliation! This girl is not her father!! [Edgar] I don't care! Change doesn't come from above. And promises don't drain the blood from your lungs. The only path to justice is if they realize they are exactly the same as us. You're gonna give her ACHE, aren't you? That's the endgame here? [Edgar] They need to see this affect one of their own. No. Edgar. Wright is not gonna change anything that he's doing. Not for his daughter, not for anyone. [Edgar] Then we will expose him to the world as the monster that he really is. -The world doesn't even know she exists. He's just going to deny it publicly, and then he's going to come after you! -Be done with this, James. One day you'll see that you were on the right side of history. Edgar, you-- [call disconnects] [digital warble] [loading noises] [digital clicks] [digital warble] [metal clicks] [refinery sounds] [bicycle clicking] [incoming ringtone] [digital warble] [ringtone continues] [bicycle brakes squealing] [incoming ringtone] [digital button] [digital warble] Ayla? I trusted you. And you lied to me. [James] I know, I'm sorry-- I don't want your apology. I-- I want you to be real. [James] I am real, I-- What do you mean? You were just using me to get to my father. I don't know what I was doing. I-- I never know what I'm doing. How can you 'not know' what you're doing?! That is a terrible excuse. [James] I know. I know. But I am real. And I want to fix things. My whole life's work... was for nothing. [James] No, Ayla, that's... no... no, I backed it all up. What?! [James] Yeah! All your stuff about the fusion reactor is here! I made copies of all your research, prototypes... It's all gibberish to me but I've got it! Really?! -And some of the paintings. Most of the "blue period"... Why did you save my work? I was gonna sell it. What's your name? Your real name? James. My, uh-- My name is James Walsh. You're too messed up not to be real. Right? "James Walsh"? -Oh, you bet I am. [Ayla] [laughing] -Look, I'm gonna fix this. Ok? First you need to go to your dad, tell them that they have control of the installation. They're gonna try and land your entire station and it will not survive reentry. So someone needs to give you a lift out of there. Okay. What are you going to do? I'm gonna try and stop them. [Ayla] By yourself?! Yeah. That's stupid! Yeah. [James] Listen, Ayla we have to stop them, and I don't know what else to do. -Well then we're going to have to figure out something else. No. I'll take care of it. You get to Wright Station and-- No. My father decided to stop work on the fusion engine years ago because he didn't think that people were worth it. And by locking that away, he has profited off the needless suffering of millions for years. He tried to erase everything that I have ever done because he was worried it might cost him his empire. Choosing to believe in people doesn't make me "naive". I'm coming down there. And you're going to come get me. [massive door opening] [wind chime] [airy button] [startup tune] [Buddha][Cockney] Good to see you again James! Good to see you, too, Buddha. [Buddha][Cockney] The People's Army already left with today's shipment. What did they take? -Why, the weapons, radar devices and portable jamming equipment, of course! Of course. Listen, I need access to my safe deposit. [Buddha][Scottish] Alright, what's the name on the account? -Darion. -And the password? Uhhh... [Buddha][Scottish] [laughing] I'm just messing with ya. [chuckle] [heavy drawer opening] [Buddha][Scottish] Now laddie, if you're lookin' to sell that device I'll knock 15 percent off my commission. No thanks. I've got something special in mind for this. [Buddha][Scottish] Mmm! Workin' for ourselves now are we? Woof. What'dya got in stock? [Buddha][British] Well we have an assortment of off-brand protein bars which won't damage anything but your digestive system. -I'll pass. -A litter of freshly sanitized newborn kittens. -Mmm! [Buddha][British] And a kinetic-assist, rapid pulse rifle. That I'll take. [Buddha][Scottish] Okay, we're sanitizing everything now. [Buddha][Demonic] Hey! Do you want me to put this on the People's Army credit account? Rock on. [Buddha][Demonic] Rock on! [Buddha][British] Sanitizing complete! [heavy item dispensing] [heavy drawer opening] [heavy drawer closing] Oh, and Buddha? [Buddha][British] Yes? I'm gonna need one other thing. [♪] I'm gonna need one other thing. [♪] [package ripping] [leather flourish] [labored sigh] [James] Can you hear me alright? [Ayla] Yeah. [James] Okay. Now I need you to look around for a little piece of black tech. It's got wires sticking out of it like legs. It looks like an insect. Could it get into the hardware? [James] No it doesn't like actually walk around or anything. That would be pretty cool, though. It probably got delivered with a shipment. It works wirelessly, so it could probably do that from anywhere. [Ayla] Okay. What are you gonna do? I'm headed to the Eastern Autonomous Zone. Achey territory. Seems like the most likely place to drop you. [Ayla] It's not with any of the deliveries. Wait a minute! I found it! James, this has eight legs. [James] So? So it's not an insect, it's an arachnid. -What are you, twelve? -What are you, dumb? [James][laughing] God I love you. We don't have time for this right now! What am I supposed to do with this thing?! -Okay, on the top there should be some numbered toggles. I need you to see what it's set to and read the numbers back to me. 3-4-3-4-4 [James] Okay, just flip any one of the switches and then read it back to me. [grunting] [metal clang] [Ayla] Ehhh... 4-4-3-4-4. Okay, so... What did I do this for? [gravel crushing] Because now I should be able to connect to the Spy.dir unit and see the list of all the vital programs the People's Army has control of. [startup chime] [typing] [failure chime] Ah, yeah looks like they've got control of gravity life support, the whole nine yards. [typing] And it definitely looks like they're going to land you in the Eastern Autonomous Zone. What about the Liferaft? -Liferaft? -My escape pod. My dad had it installed in case of an emergency to get me back to Wright Station. Is that the big thing in the kitchen? Would you be able to use the Spy.dir unit to reprogram the Liferaft to get me to Earth? Theoretically. Yeah, I should be able to program it to follow a beacon that I send from my laptop! [Ayla] Great! I can follow it to your location . Well, veer off a little. [Ayla] Nah, I'll just land right on you. Heh. Do you know how to fly it? Yes. Do you know how to land it? Theoretically. "Theoretically"?! [Ayla] I 'll figure it out! How much time do we have before the initial landing sequence? [warning claxon] [CARON] Oh, um... excuse me Miss Wright, but it appears the emergency landing sequence has been engaged! Nevermind. [large equipment shifting] [creaking echoes] [CARON] Please locate a secure surface! [disorienting warble] Shit! [♪♪] [servos whirring] [liferaft door stops] [James] Alright, Ayla, what's going on up there?! [Ayla] L ooks like I am good to go. Whenever you are. Alright I think I found a good spot. [James] In a few minutes, I'll transmit the beacon. It looks like they'll try to land you a few miles away, so we should be far enough-- [warning claxon] [servos starting up] [another warning claxon] CARON! Close the Liferaft and enable manual override! [error chime] [CARON] I'm sorry, Miss Wright But I am not authorized to enable manual override. CARON, I don't need you to authorize anything. That's why it's called "manual override". [James] We have a problem. Looks like they changed the landing trajectory. It looks like they- [glitch out] [negative alert] CARON, put him back on. CARON? [glitching alert] [CARON] Miss Wright I have a pre-recorded message from The People's Army. Would you like me to play it now? No. [CARON] Playing now. [Edgar] Hello, Miss Wright. My name is Edgar Bane. Founding member and acting general of the People's Army. As you may have noticed we are currently in the process of commandeering your beautiful apartment. Yeah, no, it looks like they've changed the LZ to right here. Must be some kind of mistake. I need to make sure I'm not transmitting my own-- [Ayla] James CARON is cutting you off--can't hear-- [static] -Ayla?! [trucks approaching] [crunching gravel] [men's voices shouting] [truck doors closing] [truck doors closing] Oh, shit. [unintelligible shouting] [Edgar] Your brothers and sisters on Earth are not your enemies. [pulse rifle firing] [Edgar] We want nothing but the best for you. To remove you from that prison. We will welcome you with open arms. We, the people will illuminate the dark by shining together. [CARON] Warning! Onboard A.I. hardware compromised! Warning! Warning! Hey, CARON. [CARON] Yes, Miss Wright? [circuits ripping] Miss Wright! Please return my central processing unit! I'm afraid that without it I won't be able to continue our lovely friendship-- [silence] [relieved sigh] [James][static] --me try this again! Ayla! Can you hear me?! -Yeah, James! [James] Oh hey! What's goin' on? -Oh, nothing. [over PA] [gunshots] What was that? -Just reliving our first date. Are you still at the apartment, sweetheart?! [Ayla] I'm running a little behind. You know I just had to do my makeup. - I'm sure you look fine darling Can we go?! -Entering the atmosphere requires a suitable ensemble.
