- Mirya? Where are the books I put here? - Wait here. Biru? Many moments in life are erased from memory. But some of them never fade away. They keep on living in our minds. But what we remember is not always what actually happened. In my life, this is what I remember. Biru died. Mom couldn't deal with it. As for Dad, he was never there. He never cared. He was always busy with himself. This is what I remember. Dad is the source of the problems. And I started to create my own world. A world where I could be on my own. Finally, I left. Dad never stopped me from leaving. I still don't understand women. You told me to call her yesterday. Remember? Because it seemed to be the best solution. Maybe I shouldn't have called her. It hasn't stopped talking since yesterday. All right. Wait a second, ma'am. What should I do? - Why did you tell me to wait? - Please wait, ma'am. It's important. This dinosaur has been talking since yesterday, and it's not important? If you want to complain, don't work here. Queue up with us here. Here, ma'am. Let me take a look. Please, after this lady, ma'am. Or I'll just call her again now. It keeps talking. It won't stop talking? Now, I'm complaining to you. - What's your name? - I'm Banyu. - Banyu. - That's right. - You think I should use this one, right? - That's right. - The one with the anti-allergy properties. - That's right. If I still get itchy or even get acne, I will come back here again and complain to you. I sold my car yesterday. What type? A regular Hyundai. But my wife loved it a lot, and I've not liked driving it since the beginning. I'm looking for a Morris '67. An antique. But they're hard to find. Can you help me? Welcome to Veronica service. You have one new message. The message was accepted on Wednesday, January 26th at 1:56 p.m. Banyu, this is Uncle Wahyu. You got the invitation, right? You have to come. Who knows? Maybe you and your dad can reconcile at my wedding. All right then. I'll be waiting. Calling Banyu Rusdi, customer service, please come back to your post. Banyu from customer service, please get back to your post immediately. - ASAP. - As soon as possible. Thank you. - What's wrong? - See for yourself. - Where are the parents? - I don't know. - Then what should we do? - Help me get him out of there. Look what he's doing. What should we do? What's this kid's name? - I don't know. - How come you don't know? I didn't get to ask. He was already in the water. - What's your name? - Adi. Adi, this tank is for fish, not for playing in. Maybe you can use this? Lola, this is a little boy, not a fish. Adi. Adi, come here, Adi. - Ban, did you got my message? - I did. Why? I need your help. - Later, after lunch? - All right. Whatever the reason, if someone refuses to pick up your call, it means that person doesn't want to talk to you anymore. If that's what happened, that's it. It's finished. Why should I fight for it? Am I right? Ban, can you do me a favor? I don't know how to start it. But promise me you won't tell anyone. Because it was already hard for me to tell you. What's the matter? - I'm late. - Late? Are you going somewhere? Late. I'm confused now. I already have two kids and my husband is unemployed. So what can I do for you? Mrs. Rima, please come to the information department. If you could cover for me and go to the seminar about employee productivity, I would owe you big time. I've been to that seminar twice. I know. No wonder you're the best at customer service here. Nar, I'm sick now, you know that? My headache just won't go away. I think you should ask Eros. He's never been there. The management wouldn't let Eros go. You see how he works. I think they'll fire him within two months. Please help me, Ban. This is my life now. From one problem to another. When one problem is solved, the next one is waiting. Whatever the problem is, big or small, everything ends up with me. My imaginary world from when I was a kid is becoming more real now. I can't even tell the difference between fantasy and reality. I know I have to talk to someone. I need help. Medical help. So, what should I do now? Maybe it's time for you to spend time with your family. And if you still can't solve the problem, report to your division head immediately. So, it's necessary for me to repeat it again. My dear friends who are attending this seminar... WHEN, THEREFORE, THAT ...please understand and apply this knowledge in your daily work. If you read thoroughly the whole of page 102, it's clearly stated, quoted, and written there that the problems that come up every day can be lessons that can teach us. They will make you grow and mature. What do you think? You understand? As I've told you many times, what I mean by "mature" here is not like "mature" as in fruits. - Miss! - I'm so sorry. - I really can't concentrate here. - Okay... Once again, I'm sorry. I'm not usually like this, I swear. To make people become high achievers. And from that achievement, an employee is able to prove his skill and upgrade his level. They can not only become regular employees, but they can be the best employee. A real best employee. If you don't understand the meaning of best employee, please turn to page 32. I'm asking you to turn to that page so you can read it, comprehend it and understand it very well. INCREASING EMPLOYEE PRODUCTIVITY FOR CONSUMER SATISFACTION You dropped your bag earlier. I put it next to you. Where are we now? I don't know. I woke up, slept, and then woke up again three times. But we're still not there yet. Where's your destination? I'm going home. Your mom and dad, where do they live? Mom passed away. - My name is Hasyim. - I'm Banyu. Has it been a while since the last time you came home? When I was about your age, I could only go back home once a year. Life is busier nowadays. I'm sure your father understands. It's been ten years since I went home. And for that ten years, I also never talked to my father. Misunderstandings between parents and children happen all the time. Dear listeners, still with our program, KKS, Kirim-Kirim Salam. First up, a message from Soleha for Kang Aib. "Hope you still care about me," she said. No one lives there anymore. Why? They moved. To where? I don't know. It's been a while. Do you live here? Me? I've been living here since I was a kid. So you know who lived here? Mr. Yuskar. You are Banyu, aren't you? Who are you? I'm Sula. Why did you go home now? Yeah. I didn't have time before. It's about time. But unfortunately, I don't know where your father is now. It doesn't mean you can't look for him. I'm sure he wants to meet you too. It's been ten years, right? Ten years. Do you work? - I do. - Really? What's your job? - I work in a supermarket. - Oh, a supermarket. - The environment here is different now. - Here? Yes. Many people here have moved. So, it's quiet here. Including Mr. Yuskar. Do you remember that swing? Who put it there? That's interesting. I don't know. It was already there when I was little. Then what about you? Me? I did think about moving from here. But it's not easy. Who would take care of the house? But actually, it's a nice area to live in. Why are you laughing? You weren't here for so long so you didn't know. What is it that I don't know? Many things. All you can see from here are houses and streets. And maybe that swing. Then what is it that I haven't seen yet? There is something. Take a look at that. You come here often? Yes. When I want to be alone. I never thought I could see you come back here again. I never thought about it either. I remember when you left your house for the first time. That's when I knew you had a problem with your father. I still remember that. What else do you remember? I remember you were skinnier back then. You carried a huge bag. Maybe it wasn't huge, but it looked huge because I was small. I also remember Mr. Yuskar watched you from inside the house as you left. What are you thinking about? I don't know. I don't even know what I'm thinking. Is it that big? Your problem? Everyone has problems. Especially problems with family. If you want to solve them, you will find a way. Don't ignore problems. If you had no intention of solving the problem, you wouldn't have been able to see this beautiful view. Am I right? What's next? If I come back here... can I see you again? What for? Well... You want to come back here in another ten years? I want to come sooner than that. Are we going to Mr. Wahyu's house who lives on Pahlawan Street? Or to Mr. Wahyu who's getting married today? - The one with the wedding. - All right. Thank you. Excuse me. It turns out that... Thank you. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Banyu! Come here! That's my nephew. - Where's your father? - He's at home. - Congratulation. - Rusdi family. Please gather for a picture with the newlyweds. Thank you. Okay, everyone. Let's take picture together. Excuse me, ma'am. A little closer. It's for the picture. Excuse me, sir. Move here a little please. Banyu. You will stay here for the night, right? - Just one night. - I have prepared a room for you. I'm glad you could make it to my fourth wedding. It's the fifth. Oh goodness. You're right. It's the fifth. It's very lucky. The fifth wedding when I'm 55. Right? Banyu, you should get married soon. When I was your age, I'd been married twice already. - Hopefully, this one lasts. - I hope so. And my dad? Your dad couldn't make it. But I understand. Why? Were you afraid you would see him here? No. In fact, I want to talk to my dad. It's about time for you to give in and apologize to him. Actually, I don't mean to apologize to him. I want an explanation from him. You should know, Banyu. Your father never stopped loving his children and wife. On the contrary, I think... his job was much more important than us to him. You're being too judgmental. Sometimes, life is not what we thought it was. The reality is different. Life is too short to stay mad. Do you know? Your father and you are very similar. Stubborn. But you're a little better looking than your father. Your father lives on Pinang island now. It's easy to get there. You can contact the Kelana travel agency. It's not far from here. Agus! Get out of the way, sir. Ma'am, please get out of the way. - Please don't do that. - Calm down. - Mei! - Please don't do it. I can't take it anymore. What should we do? Go on and jump. Don't do it! Don't! - I would rather die, Mei. - Don't. I don't have anything left anymore. - Gus. - Don't do it. Just jump. Don't do it! Don't! Mei, you're all I've got. Since fifth grade... Fourth grade. Fifth grade! Calm down... - Don't! - That's it! I will jump. Banyu, don't just stand there. Go and help. That's better. Agus. Please be patient. Think about it first. You have a problem with this?! There's nothing left for me here. All I have is an old car from the 1960s. My life is pointless now. By the way, who are you? You said a 1960s car? What car is that? A rotten car! - A junk car, you mean? - Yes! Why? - That's it! I will jump now. - Agus! Be quiet! Agus. Before you jump, please tell me the brand of that car. Why? It's worthless now. Do you want to buy that car? It's not that I want to buy it. I'm just curious. Come on, get down. Let's talk about that car. It's a Morris '67. A Morris '67? All right. Let get down first. Someone's looking for a Morris '67. - Who? - Listen. Get down here now, and then show me where the car is. After I see that car, if you want to jump or whatever, it's up to you. But get down now! BUSINESS. EXECUTIVE. SUPER VIP Excuse me. I need to ask you something. I need some information about transportation to Pinang Island. Get a ticket. Sit down first. Here's your number. Sit down. Number 22? But I'm the only one here, right? You are the 22nd person this year. Sit in front of counter three. We'll call you. COUNTER 3, DIRECTION, GOA ISLAND, BANGKA ISLAND, PINANG ISLAND It's unclear for you, isn't it? There's a girl that is expecting you to come again. Are you on a trip? But this is not an ordinary trip. You have a definite purpose. - I want to go see my father. - No. You have more important purpose. But you don't have much time. No. You don't have much time. Number 22! Your ticket? - Your destination? - I want to go to Pinang Island. Pinang Island? To the next counter. Your destination? I told you already. To Pinang Island. Are there other options than going by boat? Number 22. Destination, Pinang Island. Your question is? Is there any other option than taking a boat? - Other than that? - Yeah, maybe land transportation? Land? Yeah. Maybe by bus, train, or whatever? You want to take another route? Are you scared of water? There's no other option. All right, then. I'll buy one ticket for the first ship for Banyu Rusdi. To the port? What time do you have to be at the port? I want to be there before 10:00 a.m. Is it possible? It's possible. Don't worry. You like music, don't you? I need some entertainment here. Just open it. Pardon? Just open the box. It's okay. Open it! You can keep it. Maybe it can be useful one day. Marina! She said she was working abroad but... Women, they're all unreliable. She said she loved me, but she's cheating on me. What's the matter? Who are they? If I don't go there, she will think I don't love her. Women. So unpredictable. If she loves you, why is she with another man? What she wants is for me to go there. Love has to be maintained. Don't hold it up. Or else, it will wither and die. In this kind of situation, you have got to show her that you need her and you love her. What's wrong? He's just a friend. He's just a friend! Just a friend! MINERAL WATER, BANYU Can I ask you something? How do I get to the port from here? WHY DOES DAD SELDOM COME HOME? Why don't you buy something first? Coffee. Tea. Tea then. We ran out of tea. Coffee, okay? All right. Do you know whose car that is? Ask Arif. Arif who? Go to the intersection. Turn right. Go till you get to the orange house. - Hello, come and play with me. - Handsome. - Hey, boy. - Hi. Let's exercise, babe, it's morning. Sir, come here. Everyone's fighting for him. Hold on a second. How may I help you? I want to see Arif, the owner of the car outside. Why? I want to go to the port, but transportation here is difficult. I almost got lost on the way here, miss. Just call me Arif, Banyu. How are you? Exactly how I thought it would be. We went to the same school. Elementary school. If you don't remember me, it's fine. - Arif? Arif... - Who doesn't know Arif the lady boy? Are you shocked? Have I changed a lot? What are you doing here, Banyu? It's a long story. The next thing I knew, I was already here. So what do you need? I need to go to the port. My purpose is to go and see my father. But the transportation here is quite difficult. I saw a car and they said it was yours. So you need a car to take you to the port. Yes. Just to take me to the port. No problem. It can be arranged. How long have you been living here? How long has it been since you last saw me? It's about that long. How's your father, Banyu? I don't know. It's been a long time since I last went home. Why? We had a problem. I'm going home now to solve the problem. Solving a problem starts from yourself. Besides, it's just matter of perspective as to who's wrong and who's the victim. Me, I don't want to hold grudges against anyone. Life is short. Problems are burdens, that's for sure. They will stay a burden if we don't solve them. But do you ever feel like you're being forced to live this life? There's no such thing as "being forced" in my book. I apologize for what happened in the past. What for? When we were students, when they called you... A lady boy? But you didn't call me that. That's why. I should've done something. Done what? Defended you, maybe? Who needs to be defended? Besides, would my life be different if you'd helped me back then? That's not your boat! Was it hard to find this place? A little. How was your trip? Far. I have a spare bedroom. If you want to rest, you can use it. How was your sleep? Good. Made me lose track of time. Me too. I'm always like that too when I'm tired. You drew all of these? I don't remember you making this one. Mom never told me. There are many things that your mom didn't tell you. Mom always told me everything. She was always open with me. Yeah, with some things. Mom was not an introvert. Mom was never busy with her own things and never shut herself off. It turns out, your memory is not as accurate as I thought. Is this the way every scientist works? Cold and distant? A good scientist works based on facts, not based on memory. Can you imagine a form of research based solely on memory? What would you do if the data no longer existed? For you, we're all just data. Mom died because you've never been a part of our lives. It was your mom who left us. What do you know? You don't know anything! When Biru died... your mom's life ended too. Listen to me first. I tried to convince her over and over that it wasn't her who died. I told her once that we really needed her because we really loved her. But apparently, her soul had abandoned her body long before she got sick. There were times when she was cheerful... Full of love. Full of the will to live. That's actually why I fell in love with her. She's the only one who could make me feel complete. There's no way. No way that I can forget your mom. Even now, before I go to bed, that memory always comes. Your mom's smile. The touch of your mom's hand. And other small things. The way she talked. Now, let me ask you a question. Have you ever be loved by someone, or loved someone like that? If that's how it was, why did I always see Mom seclude herself? Why did Mom always seem unhappy? That's a fact, right? Mom was never happy with you. Let me ask you once again. What do you know about us? Only your mother and I know everything about your mother and I. All the happiness, the sadness... Only your mother and I know about it. Here. It's your mom's ring. And you should know you're not the only one missing her. I miss her too. Deeply. So, you're wrong, Banyu. You're so wrong if you think I didn't love your mom. To me, life is full of meaning because I feel that I did have love once. And I did experience being left by love. So, if you've never found a love like that... find it, Banyu. Don't waste your life. And if you still can't solve the problem, report to your division head immediately. The factor in productivity is the most important thing in the company. If you, the employee here, have some unsolved problem, then open your handbook to page 73. But if it still can't help you solve the problem... Many moments in life are erased from memory. But sometimes, we only see what we want to see. What does it mean to find an answer in a dream? It would be better to look for an answer in the real world. Life is too short.
