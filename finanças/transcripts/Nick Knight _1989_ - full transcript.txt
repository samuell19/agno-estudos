[HEAVY BREATHING] -Hold it! Who's there? [HEAVY BREATHING] [GROWLS] [SQUISH] [GROWLS] [PANTING] [BUZZING] -Room one. -Oh, Mr. Knight. Mr. Knight, are you OK? -Yeah. -Are you sure? -Why? I don't look OK? -Well you pushed the panic button. -I got a little claustrophobic. It's like a coffin in there. -Oh sorry. -Yeah. Hm. He's cute. -He's weird. Comes in three times a week and never gets a tan. KNIGHT: Jeannie, Topper! TOPPER: Hey, Nick. How are you? -Hey, you guys got a safe place to sleep tonight? -Oh yeah, we're-- we're meeting Randy and Dr. Dave right here in the park later. Got something for you if you want to drop by later. -Jeannie, make sure he doesn't drink too much of that stuff. -Don't worry, we'll save you some. -I'm serious, pal. I want you folks to keep your wits about you till we catch this maniac. -Don't worry, honey. I'll see that he stays sober. WOMAN (ON RADIO): 81 Kilo , 81 Kilo? -Got to go. -Oh, oh, you drive safe now, Nicky. WOMAN (ON RADIO): --please respond. -81 Kilo. WOMAN (ON RADIO): Natural History Museum, Nick. We got another one. -Jeez. Nate and I worked together ten years. I never seen anything like that. -Couple more pictures. Let me get a couple more. -What are you doing? -Couple more. -Come on, what are you doing? Come on. -Come on, what are you doing? Come on. Come on. Come on, come on. Come on. Come on, come on. Give me this thing. Give me this thing. Give me this thing. Give me this thing. The only way you get a good head angle The only way you get a good head angle is if you get down real low like this. That's it. Work with me, baby. Beautiful. Just like that, OK? Don't be squeamish. It's just a dead body. KNIGHT: Sign of entry? -Zip. Everything was secure. Doors were all locked. Alarm was still on. Guy had to fly in. -Or be here already. Did you search? -Got ten guys on it now. -How long Schanke been here? -Ten minutes. It's hard to miss that cologne. -Well, well, well, Mr. Knight. As punctual as usual. -I thought you were working the point tonight, Schanke. -Well I figured you might need some experienced help. -You should think about fashion photography. -Four murders in four weeks. Now from where I stand, you ain't been doing too good, Nick. KNIGHT: Is there any blood left in the body? -Not much. Looks like all the others. -Except all the others were homeless. -Can you believe they put a guy like this on homicide? Falls apart when he sees a little hemoglobin. -Dedrick, who found the body? SCHANKE: Come on, guys, let's hurry it up. It's after midnight. I want to go home and see my wife. -This doesn't belong in the same room as the other stelae. It's preclassic, isn't it? From the Tikal region. -From the Rio Azul region to be precise. Pff. Somebody told you. -What's really scary is the first four digits up there match my alarm code. -You can read it? -I've done a little grave robbing in my time. -That's illegal. -Only in the last 40 years. -As long as you or I have been alive. -In this incarnation, yeah. -Do I know you? -I'm Detective Knight. I'm the one assigned to this mess. -Alyce Hunter, curator and archaeologist responsible for this mess. -Not the body, I hope. Sorry, that was a bad joke. -Yeah, he was a good man. -Yeah, I'm sure he was. -You know, I know I've seen your face. -Ms. Hunter, where were you when the homicide occurred? -Oh, uh, I was working in my office when I heard the crash. -Glass case. -At first I though one of the exhibits had fallen, then I heard the gunshots. -Wait. You heard gunshots, and you went out anyway? -Ha, I'm a very curious woman. Stupid maybe but curious. Curiosity is the basis of all discovery you know. Nate was already dead when I got there. -The suspect was gone? -I don't see how he escaped so quickly. Especially what could he want with his blood? SCHANKE: Where'd you get the coffee? -Concession. -Hm. There's a concession open at this time? All right, let's clean up this mess and uh-- -These are from [INAUDIBLE] aren't they? -Actually, these are from an entirely new site several miles north. We kept it pretty quiet. -A new site? -A once in a lifetime find. -Wait, you said there was an artifact missing from the display case. -That's right, a jade goblet. It was used in sacrificial ceremonies. We unearthed it last year. -Do you have a picture of it? -Yeah. It was extremely rare. Maybe the only one of its type in existence. I dug it up myself. -You weren't afraid of the curse? -You know about that? -Yeah, I told you I was a grave robber. Do you know what this cup was used for? It was a practice unique to the area. -Yes, of course. It was used to ah drink the sacrificed victim's blood. -Is this another vampire murder? -Haha. Come on, you guys, you're not calling it that, are you? -We hear there's no blood in the corpse. Is that true? -Why the sudden interest? Just because this poor guy had a job? -This killer's murdering more than just the homeless. -Why don't you people go home and watch David Letterman? I got work to do. -Hey, Brunetti, what are you guys doing about this? Something's happening here. -Look, our best people are working on this case. -One person. Knight! -People, plural. When we got something to report, we'll tell you, OK? -Some regular guy gets it, suddenly it's news. -Yeah, demographics, I guess. You going to stay here for the autopsy? -Uh huh. -Uh when you get back to the station, I want to talk to you, OK? -Drink it. -What is it? -Grasshopper ears, eye of newt. What the hell do you care? Drink it. Soon I'll have you up to chicken soup. -Oh. -Did you ever notice how you could take the simplest little action like drinking a cup of tea, and you make it into a big theatrical production. -That's easy for you to say. -How's your tanning coming? -I'm up to ten minutes. -Ooh macho man. -How do I look? -Mm, like a bronze god. Ah this one's different, aside from his profession and personal hygiene, but you already knew that. -The blood loss is the same, right? -Yeah, he had his blood pumped out like the others. -Well, so how does he differ from the pattern? -The others were sharp, clean slashes, weren't they? -Yeah. -You're not holding out on me, are you? -So it's 3:00 AM, right? I'm on the line with the mayor. -Come on, we have an agreement. -Yeah, yeah. What? You think he's up watching MTV? Listen, the stakes have gone up here, yeah? -I work the night shift, and I work it alone. That was the deal. -Not this time. Listen, I've got four bloodless bodies sitting in the morgue and nothing, nothing to go on. -Three of the victims were homeless. -Yeah, and the guy tonight had a job. The victim profile is expanding. This maniac could be after anybody. And you know what's worse? That Mayan cup that got stolen, do you know what they used that for? -Yeah, I know what they used it for. -It's unbelievable. How do you expect me to keep a lid on this with this vampire crap. Listen, Nick, this case can't be yours alone. You want to work at nights, that's fine. You want to work alone nights, that's fine with me. A Murphy case, the Hudson killing, listen, you're solo on those. That is fine with me. But this investigation is not going to stop when the sun comes up. Am I getting through to you? -So who's it going to be? -I wanted to give you somebody with experience. -Who? -He's a day guy now. -His name wouldn't happen to be-- -Oh. Well howdy, partner. -Shoot me. -Come on, Nick. Put it away. -Take him up on it. [SIRENS] -Goodnight. -Bye-bye. -Are you going to be all right here tonight, Dr. Hunter? -Harry, if not, you'll be the first to know. Ah. Mm. [BEEP] [BEEP] HUNTER (ON MACHINE): Uh, this is Alyce Hunter. I'm going to be doing some research on that jade vessel tonight. Look, if you want to call or drop by later, maybe I'll have something more on it. [BEEP] -Your favorite forensic pathologist wants you to eat something this evening. You need a Jewish mother. -I already got one. -Oh I hate this. Are you finished yet? -Almost. -Well, hurry up, hurry up. Take your time, take your time. -Here we go. -Ah. -All right. -So what flavor am I? -AB positive. -Is that good? -Well you can take anything but motor oil. -Haha, motor oil, I like that. My wife, she's a universal donor, I think. -Oh too bad. -How so? -Well anybody can take O negative, but O negatives can't take anything else. -It's got to be O? -O negative. -Positive? -What's that? -Garlic. -Garlic? -My wife says it builds the blood, but you got to eat it raw. Watch this, watch this. Hey, partner. Partner. (WHISPERING) How are you? -Ugh. -What? Is it something I said? Is it my breath? -I'm allergic to garlic. -Oh I'm sorry. Sorry. Captain wants us to ride together tonight, kind of uh set things up, chew the fat. Jack wants us down at the lab. It's just for one night, then I'm back on day shifts. Hey, maybe you should hit this guy up for some blood, huh? -Nice. -Did you have a good breakfast? -Uh I went a few rounds with a hamburger. -Excellent. -I was lucky to keep it down. -I had a cheeseburger too, with large fries and a shake. I mean, these night shift. I mean, in my head I know I'm supposed to be having breakfast, but who can eat ham and eggs at 7:30 at night, right? Haha. -Huh. Don't look at me. -Would you please put out your cigarette? -What did you find? -Silk threads, black and very old. I found them under the guard's fingernails. I also discovered an anomaly-- -Oh, an anomaly, huh? -In the way the man died. All the victims were alive when the jugulars were severed. That's how the blood was pumped out. -I was wondering about that. -Now each of the first three victims showed signs of strangulation, and I believe were unconscious when the incision was made. But this guard-- I mean, his eyes weren't dilated, his thoracic region was all unbruised. I'll bet dollars to doughnuts he was fully conscious when he was being emptied . -No, I don't buy that, Jack. -Uh, it's Doctor. -Right, Doc. Uh, the guy was a guard. He had to put up a struggle. -Yeah, that's what one would normally think. -You know, maybe he was hypnotised. Maybe uh he was uh-- that's it, maybe he was a member of some sort of cult. You know what I mean? You don't know what I mean because you have no sense of history. Back in the '60s, they had a lot of strange cases like this, you know, cults. And they were always solved by finding the common link. Now what are our common links? We have uh the blood missing, the homeless. -Guard wasn't homeless, Schanke. -Maybe he was killed by another guy. Copycat killings, they do happen. OK, that's stupid, but don't go slamming any doors. You know, I've been around the block. You should listen to experience here. I know of what I speak. This thing is not going to be solved with a lucky guess. -Hey, not in my Caddy, OK? -Why don't you drive a nice, clean, city car? A box that I could smoke in. We all know you're Joe Cool, Knight, but this-- -Trunk space. -Trunk space? -Yeah. 1959 Cadillac had more trunk space than any car built in the last 30 years. -Trunk space? Well I knew that. Ah, it's better for me anyway. My wife's tried 50,000 times to get me to quit. Do you realize she hides these things every morning before she makes breakfast? -How long you been married? -Seven years. -Man, that must feel good to wake up with a woman every morning. -It's no woman we're talking about, that's my wife. Nicotine, it's an addiction you know. Man oh man, addictions are hard to give up. -Yeah. We all got our addictions. WOMAN (ON RADIO): Attention, all units in the vicinity of Echo Park, shots fired at the pool. Suspect is armed and dangerous. Possible hostage situation. All units report immediately. -What are we? What are we? -81 K. -81 Kilo. We're on it. Our backup's here. Come on. -Help us, please! He shot our coach-- -Calm down. Is he alone? -I don't know. He has a machine gun! He started to fire! He's crazy! -One man with an automatic. Sounds like drugs to me. -We're going in. -Hey, Knight! Experience says play the exits. -Then play them! Take care of the coach and the kids. -Knight, Knight, Knight! [INAUDIBLE] already bulging. I mean, you got seven commendations last year alone. -You really want this? -Yeah, I'm up for a promotion next week. -Go on. GIRL: Help me! Please. Please! Oh my god! -Shut up! -Let's make this easy. GIRL: Aah! Aah! -Shut up! Forget it, cop! [INAUDIBLE] [SCREAMS] [CRYING] Move! -Please! You're hurting me! Let me go! -Put it away, man, or she's dead! -Please! Please. -Come on. -Please. -Don't be stupid. Let her go. -You bastard! [GROWLING] -What the-- Ah aah! Ugh. -Are you covered Knight? Jeez! [HELICOPTER WHIRRING] Knight? -Ah ah ah aah! -What kind of drugs you on anyway, man? [LAUGHS] [SCREAMS] -Knight? Knight? Knight? -OK, Topper, that's it. Let's call it a night. -We got enough for ice cream. -If you ain't drinking. -Oh, dry as a bone. -You're going to stay that way. -Oh oh. -Sorry, man. JEANNIE: Here we are. My friend would like a-- -Same thing. -Anything goes for me. Do you have a quarter? Here we are. Do you see that? He's as sweet as he looks too. Topper, do you want to have an extra blanket tonight? Might get cold. No! No, no. No! -Hey, hero. I thought you were in the hospital. -Yeah, right. It's only a shoulder wound. Lost a little blood. -OK, OK. Speak. -The perp said it was a flying monster or something. -A vampire. That's what he said. -Vampire? I swear, the press has everybody in this town hallucinating. A vampire? Please! The perp had been smoking crack for 72 hours. He was incoherent. -Don't shoot me, I'm just the messenger. -You saw Knight go after him, right? -Well isn't that what I said? -Then it had to be Knight who got him, right? -Excuse me, sir, but if it had to be Knight, then where the hell is he? [SIGHS] -Smoke. -The bodies of the Indian workers could be found the next morning completely drained of blood. -Oh god, you scared the hell out of me! -Hey, whoa, easy. You OK? -Yeah, it's just after last night, I'm a little jumpy. -Something wrong? -No. No. Uh, why are you wet? -Oh, I took a dip. All in a night's work, you know? -What did you do to your jacket? Are those bullet holes? -Uh yeah. It used to belong to a drug dealer. He got hit by an Uzi. I wear it as a kind of reminder. -A reminder? -Yeah, of my mortality. A little light reading, huh? -Research. -Altun Kinal. -Hm. The first dig was abandoned because the Indian laborers were being killed at night. They believed it was by vampires. Sucked their blood. -You're kidding. -I know it sounds incredible, but apparently they were searching for a pair of goblets like the one we had stolen. -Sacrificial goblet. -Right. They found one but abandoned the dig before they could find the other. Don't you see? The murderer may have had one already and stolen ours to make the pair. -What, are you a detective now, Dr. Hunter? -Alyce, Officer Knight. -Nick. -They say everything in our future can be found in our past. -The past is the only dead thing that smells sweet. BOTH: Edward Thomas. -Do you feel that way too, Nick? -No. It's too easy a place to hide. -Is that what you think I'm doing? -Aren't you? I mean you're burying your head in books and artifacts and dust. You lock yourself up here and work all night. -I like the night. -No people. No present. No future. -It's my life, my passion. I'm comfortable with it. -Don't be. Dwell on yesterday and you have no today and no tomorrow. -Another quote? -Voice of experience. -Ha, you haven't lived that long. -I'm working on it. -Mm. Oh. It feels so good when you hold me. You know, I was actually scared tonight before you came in. -No! -Nick? -Dr. Hunter? -Harry? -You OK? -I'm not sure. Maybe-- Nick. -Where's Nick? -I figured he'd show up here. -Give me the keys. -You know, I forgot how these things drive, Doc. I'm talking smooth like a rolling condominium. -What time's sunrise? -5:45, 6:00. What's that got to do with anything? [SIGHS] -You know, you're creating a lot of tension when you disappear like this. Brunetti starts twitching-- You've got to stop drinking this. Oh. Is this the same guy that came begging to me to help him change so that he could see a sunrise? -Why? I mean, I've been doing what you've been saying for months. So I can choke on a bit of hamburger? See a sunrise? I can't even spend 10 minutes on a tanning bed. Give me the bottle! -No! Everything I do is wasted when you drink this stuff. It's the blood that keeps you from coming over. -I am what I am, and I don't think Betty Ford takes vampires. -You could be human. -Human? What's more human, to drink a little animal blood now and then or to commit murder? -Neither. -You bastard. -And you did both. -Don't you use that on me. I'm repaying my debt! I caught a killer tonight! -And you couldn't have caught him without the vampire? -Who cares how I did it? -You do. -Get out! -Oh well, that is a major change in attitude. Excuse me. You don't want help. I'm just a dot on the horizon. Go back to your TV sunrise. I'll go catch the real thing. -Will you stop? -You know, you could go public with this. Do quite well. Blood suckers as public servants. Live on Heraldo. [RINGING] No, he's probably already done it. [BEEP] HUNTER (ON MACHINE): Nick, I'm sorry to keep calling you, but after what happened tonight I think we ought to talk. Will you call me, please? -Is that the curator at the museum? -You have no idea what it's like to live all these years and watch those you love grow old and die one by one. And never having a real relationship with a woman. -What happened last night? -I kissed her. -And? -Then I nearly killed her. -Nick, don't you think it's time we talked about the others? So it was this LaCroix who was killing the Indians at Altun Kinal. -Yeah, he wanted to keep me from getting the other goblet. He did then. He still does. LaCroix, my master. The vampire that brought me over. It's like a brotherhood. We have the same blood in our veins. He wants to keep it that way. -Mm mm. Including stealing this from a museum and killing a guard. -Yeah. Came in through the skylight. It's the only way in. I did it tonight. It's him. -Mm mm. And he believes that by doing this ceremony you could become mortal. -We both do. Turn the lights out when you leave, will you? I'm going to get some asleep. -What about the street people? He killed the guard at the museum to get the cup, the Indians to halt the dig. That still doesn't explain why he'd be killing these homeless people. -Because they were always our pray. Nobody notices, nobody cares when they're missing. Never bothered LaCroix. He could never understand why I stopped killing. So he follows me from city to city and from century to century, obsessed with keeping me in the darkness. [SIGHS] These murders are his way of calling me out, Jack. His way of getting to me. HUNTER (VOICEOVER): Adding to the problem of keeping the Indians at work were the mystical properties said to be possessed by the goblets themselves. The European occultists believed that the Mayan ceremony, where the blood of the sacrificed victim was poured from goblet to goblet then swallowed by the high priest, could in fact be the cure for vampirism. It was only natural that the Indians believed there were vampires in their midst. -Anybody seen Jeannie and Topper? Got two bucks for them. -Throw it, throw it! [SCREAM] [SIRENS] -He was hit by a blunt object on the head. Probably knocked unconscious prior to the jugular incision. -No two punctures this time? -An incision. -Where's Jeannie? I mean, she never left Topper alone. Dedrick, anything? -Nothing on the west side. -Who saw him last? -The old man. -Where was he? -Up by 6th street around noon time yesterday. Usually find something to eat up there at the Burger Barn. -Were they together? -They're never apart. I knew something was wrong when they didn't show up for the blood drive. -Wait, wait, wait. They were collecting blood here today? -Yeah, they're here every Thursday. You give a little, you get a little. Do something to help a sick person. -You hear that, Knight? -What's the matter? -Jack, we should have put them up. -What? Are you going to put up all the street-- -This is my fault. This is all my fault! -You got to stop blaming yourself. -OK, blood drives, homeless. I think there's a connection here, right? Their blood's missing. -Excuse me. You work the day shift, am I right? -What's that got to do with anything? -Work it out in your own time! -They all gave-- what's his problem? -I don't think you want to know. -No, I want to know. -Whoa. Name, please. -I'm not on the list. -Well that won't get you in. This-- Ooh! Ooh! Ah. OK, this time. Oomph. [LAUGHING] -Ahem. What are you laughing at? -We still calling you Janette? -If you like. I'd heard you were in town. -Three years. -Wasn't it Chicago before? -It was time. -The Dorian Gray syndrome. -Although if I'd known they were going to install lights at Wrigley Field-- -I hate the baseball. -Another thing that came between us. -Poor Jean-Pierre. [SPEAKING FRENCH] The light's dark, I'm the owner, and I find I can mix it with a little wine. Would you like some? That's right, you're probably on duty. -He's here. -I know so many people. What's your name this time? Nicky something? -Where is he, Janette? -He hasn't been making these kills if that's what you think. Nowadays, no one's that stupid. -Where? -Always the gentleman. Filthy habit. At least I know it won't kill me. I'd be careful if I were you. He's very disappointed. -What are you doing here? -We have to talk. Actually, I'm with someone. -Get back. Why are you staring at my chest? -Why are they staring at my neck? -What are you doing here? -I followed you. -What? -From the park. I heard about the murder on the radio. I figured you'd be there so-- [SIGHS] -Get out of the car. -No! -I'm on police business. -I'll ride shotgun. -No, you won't. [HONKS] MAN: Come on, move it, buddy! -Get out. It's dangerous. -This has something to do with vampires, doesn't it? Nick, you got a secret you'd like to share with me? -Tell me something, do you do all your reading in supermarket checkout lines? -Well? -Well what? -I went through a pint of ice cream and two bags of chips the other night trying to find this. Is this you? -Yeah, it looks like me. -Even the scar on your chest is the same. -Then it must be me. -It was taken in 1889. -Then it must be someone that looks like me. -Right, who knows about the goblet, who can read glyphs, who can disappear in the middle of the museum in 10 seconds flat. -Are you losing it or what? Everybody in the world's got a double. My uncle's a dead ringer for Morton Downey Jr. While that may make him miserable at times, it does not make him a vampire. -Am I making a complete fool of myself? -I got out of the museum the same way the murderer did, through the back rooms and into the basement. [INAUDIBLE] -God, and I call myself a scientist ? -Legend's are seductive. You want to believe them. It's like good gossip. -But I did want to believe it, Nick. -What? That I was a vampire? -Well think about it! How incredible to be an archaeologist, a-- a historian and have a-- have a living first hand connection to the past. -There you go again. Living in the past. -I guess. I-- -Isn't there anything about the present you like? -Nick, about last night-- -Hey, chemistry just went a little pssh, you know? -I was talking too much. -Hey, it's history. It's in the past, OK? It's just you and me now. And the Caddy. -You going to let me stay? -Where's your car? -Back at the club. -Nightcrawler's bringing you a little lead on KTDE, metal for the ages. Three weeks in this town, and I still haven't seen my old friend. -Where did they dig up this guy? LACROIX (ON RADIO): It's been such a long time. We have a lot to catch up on. -This next set is dedicated to you, Jean-Pierre. LACROIX (ON RADIO): The Nightcrawler's waiting for you. I know you're out there. Where are you? [MUSIC PLAYING] -Listen to me. Keep it tuned to this station. If you hear anything weird or I'm not out in 20 minutes, pick up this radio, say 81 Kilo needs backup at this address. -Wouldn't it be better if we just called them now, or at least introduced me to the person I'll be talking to? -Just stay in the car, OK? [BUZZES] [MOOS] -I thought we could talk over a midnight snack. -LaCroix, where is it? -Now is that any kind of a hello? Hm. Such a long time, Jean-Pierre. After all the trouble I went through to find you? I guess it would be more appetizing. You look pale. Are you sure you're not hungry? -All I want is the goblet. -You think you know what you want? You never have. Immortality. Wasn't that your big wish? To live forever? Never have to wind up like this. Ha ha. I gave that to you, and what did I get? Contempt, hatred, and desertion. -I couldn't kill anymore. -Who has to kill? -You do. -The guard? Yes. But not those pathetic others. This is the 20th century. That's not the way things are done. -You're lying. -It's the truth. -They were my friends! -And what were we? We need to trust each other. We should trust each other. How long is the longest friendship? -I want the goblet! -Then come get it. Hmm? Feeling a little weak? Perhaps you need an iron supplement. [LAUGHS] -Is this a joke? Pathetic, cowering mortal! Taste the blood on your lips. Taste it. You can't deny what you are. -Ugh. Aah! -You're never going to get the goblet. You haven't the courage! No guts, no glory, man. You want mortality? I'll give it to you. By fire or stake through the heart. By the sun. And we're all mortal, my friend, by decapitation. [LAUGHS] What's it going to take to get a rise out of you? -Alyce, get out of here! -Mm. Uh. Is this someone I should meet, hm? Ah ah. [LAUGHING] I think this is a good time to find out just how much you want to be mortal. It's a simple choice. A classic. Which one do you want to save? The goblet or the girl? Hm? -Bastard! BOTH: Aah! -Ugh. -Ah! -Aah! [SCREAMING] -Aah! Aah! [SIZZLES] [RINGING] -Miguel? MIGUEL: What? -All I know is I need those reports. MIGUEL: I'll get them. -Don't make me look bad. MIGUEL: You got it. -Yes? HUNTER (ON PHONE): This is Alyce Hunter. Is Detective Knight there? -Uh Knight? Uh no, ma'am, he hasn't checked in. -Well when he does check in, would you tell him Alyce called? OFFICER (ON PHONE): Yes, ma'am, I will. -Thanks. [SIGHS] -You're telling me that nobody has seen Nick or talked to him since he walked out of the park? -I was asleep, sir. -You guys sure picked an interesting spot for a meeting. Captain, I [INAUDIBLE] the report on the park killing. I think Knight was working on a lead. -Yeah? Well I'm just praying I can make it sound better than that to the mayor, you know? -Blood drives, blood drives, blood drives. What were the victims' blood types, Doctor? -Yes. Well each of the homeless were type O negative, but-- -I'm telling you, that's the key. The type O, the homeless, the blood drives. -Wait, wait, wait. What about the guard? -The guard was type AB. -Captain? Traffic found Detective Knight's car illegally parked. They impounded it. -Hmm. OK. We got the keys. I'll send somebody down. -Yes, sir. -I'm telling you, nobody's listening. Nobody's listening to me. All of a sudden, Knight's this big, experienced hotshot, and I'm telling you, he has no experience. Don't get me wrong, I like the guy. He looks good in leather. Between you and me and the lamppost, the guy is in the dark about a few things. It's a cult thing. It's got to be a cult thing. I'm telling you, it's a weird, weird world we live in, my friend. [RUMBLING] -Oh, would you listen to that baby purr? Oh, that takes me back to 1973 in Chicago, Illinois. Hm. A buddy of mine had one of these things. We used to cruise north up Lake Shore Drive all the way to Waukegan. Know what I mean? Nah, you don't know what I mean. -That it, pal? -Yeah, that's it, that's it. Dispatch, 81 Kilo. I'm going to tool around in Knight's Caddy. Let me know if he turns up, OK? -Hi. -Hello. -Hey. -Hi. -You're early today. The test lab isn't ready for it. At least I can do some cataloging. [RINGS] -Blood bank. The police? When will they be here? I must talk to Dr. Dantley before I release any information to you. -81 Kilo, code 6, City Hospital blood bank. [FOOTSTEPS] -Oh. You don't know what floor the blood bank's on, do you? -I'm telling you, she's lovely. She's gorgeous for you. I'll have you over for dinner. And look at her. Just look at her-- -She's very pretty. -And you'll see, you'll love her! -I'm on a restricted diet, honestly. -Oh, you're making a mistake. You'll love her. Oh, you'll love her if you see her. -I can't believe this. You think this is fake? I'm a cop. You can't get me access to the computer? -Not without Dr. Dantley's approval. -Listen, I am just trying to make some connections here. Could you at least tell me if any of the victims donated blood? -Dr. Dantley will be BOTH: back at 6:00. -Right, right. Thank you very much, very much. Fenner, my man, could you please tell this woman that I'm a good guy, that I donated some AB blood the other day? -He's one of our regular donors. -See? There, there. -The information is confidential. -Sorry. -Yeah, right, thanks. -Are those old uh Cadillac keys? -Yeah, a '59 ragtop, a classic. Did you know that the '59 Caddy has more trunk space than any other car made in the last 30 years? -Really? How's the mileage? -With a ride like that who's counting, uh? Hey listen, could you just get this Dantley guy on the phone for me? We are this close to catching the murderer. -Sorry. [INAUDIBLE] -Jack, it's Nick. JACK (ON PHONE): Man, where are you? Ah, it's a long story. Hey listen, who said Schanke could ride around in my car? -Brunetti. There was nothing I could do. -So I'm running a check in the blood bank. Get this, Schanke was right. All the homeless victims were blood donors. O negative. JACK (ON PHONE): What about LaCroix? -Well he just offed the museum guard, but the guy that's doing the killings is still on the street. Hold on. SCHANKE: Dr. Dantley, police department. -Nah, I'm going to get a warrant. -Listen, I got to go. My ride's leaving. -No, wait, Nick, uh you sound weak. Can you eat something? -Hah, are you kidding? Hospital food? Call you later. -Is Dr. Dantley in the PGA tour? I'm a detective, Schanke, from the police department, and I've been looking for him for a while. And-- and you can't help me? [DING] -Hey! [MUSIC PLAYING] -No. Jeez! Come on. Don't do this to me! No. [HONKS] [HONKING] Hey! Go away! Out of the way! [HONKS] Please. He's going to kill me. -Schanke, if only you knew. -Hey, don't give me that attitude! You think I did it on purpose? And when you're filling out the report, spell my name right! It's Schanke! S-C-H-A-N-K-E! Come on, let's get out of here. OFFICER (ON PHONE): Yes? -Yeah, Detective Knight, please? OFFICER (ON PHONE): I'm sorry, he's not here. Can I take a message? -No, thanks. I'll call back. [RINGS] KNIGHT (ON MACHINE): Hi, I'm either in bed or incommunicado, so if you want to leave your name and number, just wait for the beep. [BEEP] -Dr. Hunter? -Guys, guys, we can't put that here. Put it back, please. -OK. -Got it. -Where am I going to get the parts? Tell me and I'll do it. -Well you can fix what you got, right? -Hey, what do you use for brains? Right front fender, totalled. Quarter panel, totalled. Door, totalled. Rear panel, totalled. Fender, bumper. And this trunk. Look at this. Uh. Ugh. Ah. This thing's mushed so tight we'll have to torch it open. -You're exaggerating, right? -Hey, you find me another Caddy, maybe in some junkyard, I might be able to help you out. Otherwise, you got two tons of scrap metal here. -Oh man, oh man, oh man, he's going to kill me! He's going to kill me. Or worse still, he's going to make me pay for it. -Schanke. -I'm dead. Honest to god, I-- I was on my way back to the station but the hospital's on its way, so I said, why not, I might as well just go to-- this kill me, Knight! It kills me more than it kills you! -Breaks failed? -On their own, I swear it. I've had four police driving courses. I know how to stop a car. -They were cut. -They were cut? By who? -By the one we're looking for. Seems you were right, Schanke. -I was right. -Museum murder was a different killer. -It was? -Yeah, blood drives and the homeless, they were the keys all along. -Well I knew that. -I know. -Does that mean you're not angry about the car? -No, I am mad about the car! (MUMBLING) But I guess I own you an apology about the case. -What? -I said, I guess I owe you an apology about the case! -Well I accept it. -Good. -Hey, hey, you OK, man? You look death warmed over. You all right? -Oh man. Uh. I'm just a bit weak. I'm hungry, that's all. -I got some jerky. -You're kidding? Let's get back to the hospital. -Hey listen, jerky's not bad for you. It-- it sort of stimulates the-- [BEEPS] -Nick? KNIGHT: The victims are all regular blood donors, O negative, and they all used the mobile units. -Who told you that? -Dr. Dantley. Ha ha. Oh, the mystery Dr. Dantley? -Any news on Jeannie? -No, nothing. Hey listen, between you and me, what was your car doing in South Park last night? -Anybody report anything weird up there this morning? -No, why? -Alyce and I had a lead on the stolen goblet. [LAUGHS] We were up there with the-- -Alyce? You were with Alyce last night? Listen, Nick, between you and me, is something going on with you and Alyce? Come on. Dr. Hunter and me? -Yeah. -It's none of your business. -I have my answer. I got my answer. -Nick? If you're trying to scare me again, you're doing a pretty good job. oh. Uh uh. -Where is he? Where? -Ugh. -Where? -Ah ugh. -Where's Nick? -All we need from you is the answers to a few questions. -Like? -Like who has access to the blood donor readings. -Ah, blood bank staff, physicians, hospital administrators. -Well that narrows the field a bit, doesn't it? -Anybody come in and out of here this afternoon while Detective Schanke was here? -Yeah, there were a few nurses, Dr. Simmons popped through. -You all right? -He's just hungry. You should have something to eat, Knight. -I'm OK. I'm all right. -You sure? -Yeah, just give me a minute. Uh. OK. No, I think the guy we're looking for is like a janitor or orderly. Someone that wears their keys on their belt. -Keys. Let me check my logs. -Yeah, have them ring the bell. No, please just hurry. Oh, it's cold in here. The ambulance should be here any minute now. -No. No hospitals. -You need help. -He'll be there. -Who? -Yeah, he was asking a lot of questions about the Caddy, but how did you know about the keys, huh? Huh? -My secret. -No, no, no, we have no secrets. -Jack Fenner, he's a wonderful man. -Yeah, real regular guy, Nick. -Anything happen to him this year? Any kind of trauma might have put him over the edge? -He's been in counseling. -For what? -He lost his mother. -How? -Car accident. Well not really, that's the problem. She lost a lot of blood in the car accident and needed several pints. We always test our blood, but I guess some of the blood she received was infected with Hepatitis. -That's what she died from? The hepatitis? -Mr. Fenner blames himself for letting it slip through. -I bet you she was O negative. -I bet you she was. -What has that got to do with it? -Well you see, O negative is the universal donor, but can only receive O negative blood. -Some of the blood came from street people, and the regulars that he knew. Maybe he might blame them as well as himself. -Maybe he'd see to it that they could never donate again. -Detective Knight, I want to put out an APB. -I'll be with you. I won't leave until Nick gets there. Ambulance? Take the elevator. It's on the second floor. -Hold on, Schanke, I just want to check my machine. -Come on. My wife's going to kill me, Nick. She's-- Look it, they got bagels! Great. [RINGS] [TAPE REWINDS] [BEEP] JACK (ON MACHINE): Where are you? Will you please check in with me. I'm getting nervous. -It's him. [BEEP] Nick! Nick! -Alyce, what are you doing there? -Looking for you. Where are you? -How'd you get in? -The Mayan numbers on the stelae. -Huh. Very clever. -Someone named Jeannie's here. -She's alive! -Barely. The guy that beat her up left her for dead. Look, she knows who's doing the murders. -Did you call an ambulance? -Yeah. They're on their way now. -OK. If the paramedic thinks she's stable, don't move her. I'll be right there. -Hang on, the guy's here now. -Wha-- wait a minute, where's your stuff? Don't you have a medic bag? JEANNIE: No! -Who are you? Ugh. Ugh. Aah! -He's at my place. Put a call out and meet me there. -Watch it. -Come on. -Hey. -Hey, hold it, hold it, hold-- hey! -Ugh. -You want to tell me how you're going to get there? WOMAN (ON RADIO): Well we've been looking all over for him. Where the hell is Knight? -Listen, all he said was meet him at his place, then he flew out of here. -Ah, ah. -I had to kill Topper. [GROANS] [WAILING] -Aah! Oh! -Ugh. -Jeannie, where's Alyce? Can you make it to the elevator? -I think so. -Go. Alyce? Can you walk? -I'm not sure. -No! Ah aah! -I think you got what was coming to you. Now it's your turn. You know, steel spikes can't kill a vampire, but fire can. Ha ha. Isn't it time you gave up? -I don't think he'll come through the fire. -Nick-- -When I get him to the other side of the room, I want you to run to the door. -You look weak, Jean-Pierre. When's the last time you fed? I don't think you have the strength to change. Do you? -Feed on my blood. -No. -It's a wonderful offer, Jean-Pierre. Take her. Make her one of us. -No, I can't. It could kill you. -Or make me immortal. -No, you don't know what you're saying. [INAUDIBLE] -Listen to her. -Take me. -Do it. -Uh. No! -You really think you can take me as a mortal? -Go to hell! -Not before you. -Aah! Ugh. Uh. Ah. Ya! Ah! Ya! -Getting a little warm down there? [ROARS] -Ugh. Ah. -Ah [GROWLS] Ah. [LAUGHS] -Ugh. Ugh! Aah! [SCREAMING] -She wanted to live forever. -So did you. It's very seductive, the idea of never dying. -Never being able to love someone. Is that seductive? She had no idea. Alyce and LaCroix, they're the lucky ones. -Oh you don't mean that. Is that why you want to become mortal? So that you can die? Or do you want the experience of living and loving like a human being again? -I don't know if that will ever happen. But you know, I was so close. -Listen, are-- are there any other objects or rituals that might help? -Well there's a rumor that a goblet was sold in a private collection. -Well, keep looking. -You really think you can bring me over? -I don't know. Keep eating. -Well, well, well, well, fancy meeting you gentlemen here. Allow me to present to you the keys to a 1959 Cadillac in cherry condition. Little did I know I have a third cousin in the auto body business. Relatives do come in handy, partner. -Partner? -Well Brunetti thought it would be a good idea. -It's a good idea. -Yeah. After all, I did save Nick, right, Jack? I mean, Doc. -One way to put it. -I uh did put the hospital thing together, the blood bank stuff. Major contributions. -Major. -OK, OK, so why do I think somebody's holding out on me here, huh? -What do you mean? -Well OK, I understand about Fenner. He thinks he killed Jeannie. She's AB negative, so he didn't drain her blood. I got that. But what about Fenner himself? -What about him? -Well if he was the guy that was draining the blood, then why was two pints missing from his body when we found him? -Evaporation. -No. No, no, I don't buy that. -Absolutely. From the heat of the fire. -OK, OK. I'm buying it. I'm buying it. -Oh cigarettes. Fastest way into a coffin, huh, Nick? -One of them anyway. -You guys are starting to sound like my wife. I'm trying to quit. I'm trying. Don't give me that look. You have no idea what it's like to live with an addiction. You don't. So what do you think of the car, huh? Third cousin's name is Rudy, Rudy Schanke. He's at Van Nuys. He is great. I'm telling you, Michelangelo works in marble, Rudy works in bondo. He's got everything he wants. He's an artist-- [MUSIC PLAYING]
