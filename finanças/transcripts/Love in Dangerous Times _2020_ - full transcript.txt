So what do you think about all this? I don't know. The more I do your research on it, the more I feel like it's really not that big of a deal. Do you think? Just doesn't. Well, most people are taking it pretty seriously. Yeah, most people are cheap besides the media likes to blow everything out of proportion. Okay, I don't know about that. I read in your profile, you're an artist. What do you do? A little bit of everything. So you're unemployed? - No, I'm a playwright. - Really? I don't know what you've seen. I sometimes review I watch a lot. That's pretty cool. Most of my work is out of State, so probably not then. So what is this one about? The play? What? You're afraid I'll share your idea or something? Nah, it's not that simple. It's just, I don't know, when you have an idea, you don't wanna share it too soon or else the whole thing could fall apart. It seems like you're pretty serious, about your work. Yeah, I take my craft pretty seriously. That's respectable and sexy. Well, I think you're pretty sexy. That was teasing. You're right, but it worked. You're smiling. All right, I'm just curious. How do you think people are gonna cope if this thing does get outta control? I thought it was being blown out of proportion. Yes, exactly. That's exactly why people are gonna freak out. Look, I'm just saying, if we do have to go on lock down, how do you think people are gonna connect? - People get creative. - Yeah. Like what? What do you mean like what? People are gonna do what they need to do in order to get to know each other. Something like this, but a little bit more intimate. A little more intimate. Say we got together in real life and you didn't like the way I smell. Well, if we're supposed to stay home, that will matter. Fair enough. I'm more curious, I don't know, what do you think? Do you wanna go into lockdown all by yourself? Oh my God. Are you- - What? Are you trying to look for someone to shut up with, if we go on lockdown? No, no, no, it's not that simple. Just think about it. The dating apps, they're all on fire right now. They're blowing up. They do wanna connect. Great, but I think it's a little deeper than that. Think about it, when faced with extinction, what's the most natural urge to propagate and populate this species? It's totally natural. You can't blame us for it. You didn't answer my question. Sorry, I can't. People just be direct sometimes. Yeah. In fact, I think, I find that a little bit refreshing. Yes, exactly. It's the authenticity that makes us interesting. Well, I think you're pretty interesting. Thank you. So if I could take you on a date in the real world, what would you like to do? I don't know, maybe let's go for dinner and dancing, and maybe to the beach. All those sound lovely. Well, since we're still stuck here in our phones with no potential real future to take you to the beach anytime soon, maybe we get a little frisky. Do you think I could see your boobies? I've dwelled in small places before. I've dwelled in small places before. I've dwelled in small places before. I thought about suicide, more times and I haven't. I feel like a failure. I feel like this should be fucking right there and it's not. I feel like a fucking failure. I feel like a failure. All I do is feel like failure. I'm not a failure, I might get back up, I'm gonna go again. I've dwelled in small places before, contemplated suicide. I've bed overseas where other men have tried to kill me. I wanted love to save me. I believe love could save me. I still fantasize every day about how love will save me, but it won't. All right, some movement. Are you okay, the serious guy? Yeah, I'm all right. Keep playing, play it on. You gotta stick along, brother. You need to lighten up. I could be the last dude you see in a very long time. I was singing. You were moving your mouth and the sounds were coming out. Look, I don't have the talent that you got. I don't have your talent. You ready for this dude? 'Cause you don't strike me as the planning ed type. I'm probably more prepared the most. Your dad send you all of that? He likes story. Bad. You know what pisses me off? Everything? So many friends in my life, who I thought were my good friends. And nobody's reached out to see how I'm doing. Present company excluded. The truth comes out then, huh? Don't you think that people might be just a little bit occupied at this very moment? Oh. I know people are self-absorbed. When the survival instinct kicks in, it's a powerful thing, man. Sure, but this whole pandemic, it's just a big distraction. Yeah. You just keep telling yourself that, bro. But the truth is is that you gotta really face up to what's going on. This is real shit. You should be home with your familia. I need to work, that play isn't going to finish itself. You know what? I think staying here is the right move. I think it's important to go through something like this alone, builds character. Character. Character. When I was 27, Hey, that's not bad. Write that shit down. Ishmael. Thanks for coming to see me. I gonna come to give you those. Vitamin C? And. Cold! Cold. Hey, tell her I said, "Thanks." See, people ain't so bad. Correction, you're not so bad. Come here! You finish your play. Well, I'll do. - Love you. - Love you too, brother. Yeah. Adios. Ciao. Yeah, well, I really don't know what else to say, because we have to do this. I'm trying to call everybody individually because I just don't want it to sound personally, you know. I still think we should give delivery a try though, a lot of other restaurants are doing it. Yeah, but how am I gonna safely run the kitchen. It's a close quarters operations. Everybody's in there together. We won't be getting that many orders as much as we're usually getting, so we just pair down the staff. We can have somebody in the kitchen cooking, somebody in the dish pit. They don't have to go anywhere near each other. I can do most of the driving. We can set it up. We can make this work, Marco. Nah, nah, I'm not too worried. If anything, it's just another minor setback. I'm actually doing pretty good out here in Portland. Starting to get recognized as a local actor. I even got recognized in the grocery store the other day. You're commercial with one of the suitcase? Yeah. I'm I'm also writing a lot more. I pretty much finished the next play and saving money, cutting costs. Ishmael, he's gonna help me produce it come fall. Produce it in the fall, for what? Who is gonna see it? You're saying, "The virus is probably airborne." Yeah, I got a friend who works in the medical industry and she says, "It's really not as bad as people are making it out to be." Well, your friend is an idiot. You all stacked up, back home. Lockers at capacity. Same one as Y2K. Did I tell you I'm Oh what now? It's enough to stand in line for toilet paper, yeah. I'm sorry. Wow, that's genius. Yeah. - Watch out, they tickle. - I'm not ticklish. They also kinda. - What? - Nah, nevermind. - What? - Stupid thought, nevermind. They make you feel good or something? Yeah, Dad, you might get a boner. You're classic. Look, I do wanna come home first chance I got, but the guys at the restaurant, we're all trying to get- - Know that you can't you wanna come home, huh? Dad, I was there for Christmas. Nah, I don't want racism. Have you talked to your brother? No. But you should. He's doing awesome. There's a lot of opportunity here. Make it really happening. I'm not gonna get between you two anymore though, to talk to you Hey, dad. Okay, dinner's done. I gotta get back to writing. Can call you back tomorrow? All right. All right, bye dad. Jason, I love you. Jason, I love you. Jason, I love you. Jason, I love you. Jason, I love you. Jason, I love you. Take it yourself. I'm gonna be okay to really quit, huh? You can't do that either? I'm so sorry. - Just put it down. - Okay. Do need a signature from you, I sanitize the screen every time, so appreciate it. Just a touch- - I swear they may touch a screen - to begin with. - I know. - Hello. - Hey. Oh, there's your face. Here's my face. Wow. What? You are stunning. Thanks. Sorry, that was abrupt. Sorry, no, sorry, I don't think I'm bored as well, sorry. No, no, it's full. You look a little different from your picture. Oh yeah. I should get some new ones up there, right? I feel like I'm getting more gray in my beard. No, no, it's okay. I don't feel like catfish or anything. So how do you say your name actually? It's Sorrel. Like a bird soars and then rel like rel. Cool, I don't think I know any Sorrels. So what brings you on here, Jason? I came just looking for someone to have a really great conversation with, and feel some connection. And then, you know, one or both of us will just ghost each other for no particular reason. Same. So do you get a lot of attention on here? I mean, I've messaged a handful of people. You're the first one to reply back to me in a while. How many dick pics did you send? You know, believe it or not, none. Mostly, 'cause I couldn't get the right angle to make it look big enough, so. Well, I'm swamped with messages. All dick pics? Not actual dicks, but most of them were probably dicks. I'd one guy who asked to see my boobs. Like the first time we talked. Oh no, that sucks. Yeah, guys are dumb sometimes. Yeah. So why did you message me back? You have an honest face. Thank you. Yeah, but you also have a sadness in your eyes. Sadness in my eyes. Hold on. I think I know where I've seen your face before. On the website of the restaurant? No. Oh no. Okay, this is embarrassing. Where did you find that? You're the guy from that commercial. The guy on the beach, carrying the suitcase. That's me and yep. Oh, man- - I mean sorry, it's just, it's cool. In fact, it was cool. Well, I don't know. I feel like I'm a playwright first and foremost, but yeah, I definitely do a lot of acting and I teach a little bit of acting as well. Well, I'm a teacher. That's right, yes. I meant to ask you, I remember reading that in your profile. What do you teach? I teach middle school ESL. All right, English as a Second Language. It sounds like you could brush up on your Spanish, a little bit. Yeah, I probably should. Well, I was thinking about going to bed. Oh yeah, yeah, that's cool. You probably got a big day of sitting around in quarantine tomorrow, so I get it. Yeah, exactly. Well, hey, this is, you're kind of fun, right? This has been nice. Can I give you my number, just in case? Yeah, it's nothing serious though, okay? Right, right, no. Yeah, no, I get it. If you're just looking for a buddy for the apocalypse. - I'm totally cool. - Sure. Okay, I'll send you a dick pic later. Please don't. No, no, no, I'm kidding. Goodnight. Brian. There he is, he lives. Look at that, my little baby brother. Man, you're so beautiful. Where you at, Brian? Come on, man. This is fucking ridiculous, seriously. How long is the bed, baby? How long? I'm doing much better supposed to you. No, you're no, to be honest. All right, and whether you like it or not, I'm the one that's looking after your ass, right? You used to be at home over here, like everybody else. I am home, all right? I got projects, I'm working towards deadline. I have people that are waiting on me, I gotta stay focused. You've worked at finding a restaurant, bro. What is it? The dig into battle burger to get out on time. Given that bothered, that's enough. And you wonder why I don't call you anymore. Hey, you what? You wonder why I don't call you anymore. Oh, come on man. Seriously, you don't have to. When, when did you get older to say all this, right? Stop blaming me, huh? You know what you're getting into, baby. This is business, man, and business is a gamble. Come on, you know this. Well, don't take the camera off, bro, come on. Seriously, I'm sorry. I called you to let you in on a deal. All right, hear me out. What's one thing that half of the population needs right now but can't access because of the pandemic? Stimulus check. No baby, tampons. Though these tampons probably going for $9 a piece right now. We can sell 25 for $25. It's a dollar, a fucking tampon. And if you go to the 112 pack, will you drop that down to our cost? Bye, Brian. Goodbye. You suck, you suck. Boring, boring, boring. Are you still working on the play? How's that coming? It's coming along. Yeah, did you My neighbor across the way. Yeah, why? Did he die? Yeah, he did actually, yesterday. Wow, shit dad. I'm sorry. Are you doing okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I mean, it was kind of, it was quick, you know, he was a good guy though. Didn't never stirred anything up. Took my lawnmower, fixed it, brought it back. But you never really came into contact with him or anything? No, not really. No, not really? No, I heard him coughing, you know, and I took to him food, and later when he was sick and needed, I went and got his medication. That's really great, dad. But did you keep a safe distance the whole time? I would say, yeah, yeah. You're not convincing me right now. You know what? You need to take care of you and stop worrying about what I'm doing, all right? You know what? You have to stay there in sickness central so you can work on your play, and instead of being here- - Everyone has - to stay put. - You know, that you're selfish. Everyone has to stay put at this point. Probably, it's because we always baby you too much. I'm your father. A little respect would be nice, okay? I'm gonna use my judgment for my situation, which is not nearly as bad as yours. And I would appreciate a little respect from you. I wish you'd respect your own life, and maybe take a few more precautions, than you're doing, that's all. Kid, make me a sandwich. Hey, I can leave this right here for you. I need a signature real quick. Just gotta, if you could. Sorry. - Sorry, sorry. - No. - It's allergies. - Yeah, yeah. I didn't pay you. It's okay, it's okay. Dude, it's not even really airborne You've got nothing to worry about. First they're saying, "It's airborne," now they're saying, "It's not," I don't know, I don't trust it. Do you worry? Come on. Yeah, yeah, I'm actually worried, okay? She coughed, it hit me in the face. Listen, everyone is thinking about end of the world right now, everyone. It's actually the end of the world, we know it's perfectly But what if it's actually the end of the world? What if everybody gets wiped out? Not a living soul left. That means everything, you and I ever did, doesn't fucking matter, because there's nobody here to remember it. You think of that? Everyone gets one freak out, dude. Okay, you're just feeling yours right now, 'cause you can't be fucking immortal, that's what it is, and move the fuck on. Dude, I just can't shake the idea that I might die alone. Dude, it's the apocalypse, I got shit to do, I got to go, man. Okay, I can be Cool? Dude, I don't feel like, you're being a really good friend right now. Brother, man, okay? Real shit. Yeah. Dude, I'm being a dick, I'm sorry. Yeah, you don't take on someone else's time. - Hey, Sorrel. - How are you? I'm good. Cool, round two. This is officially my longest relationship yet. What are you up to? I was just doing some cycling, kind of going nowhere fast. How are you? I got out of the house today. I went to the grocery store. How'd it go? It was strange. I watched two people fight over hand wipes. Yes. Yeah, I was kinda bad actually. Like everybody's panicked shopping. I couldn't even find tampons. Hang on, I just, something popped in my head, one second. I got a line of dialogue. Oh wow, what's the dialogue. It's for this new play I'm working on. Oh, what's your play about? I don't know, it's like kind of too early to sum up, you know? Sorry, no need to share if it's too soon. No, no, no, that's cool. Feel free to share when you're ready. You know what? It's good, I bet I could give you an overview of the play if you wanted. Okay, rough draft, here it goes. The main character is Trent, and he's driving down the Crater Lake, when the volcano erupts a second time, and causes a landslide that basically buries him in his car alive. But he's got cell reception, so he calls his ex-wife, and they just kind of like hash out all their old stuff until, you know? Yeah, it's kind of depressing, actually. I watched that. Yeah, cool, thanks. I have thought about playing Trent. A lot of my emotional baggage is kind of put into his character. So I feel like it would be cathartic to play that on stage. All right, but acting is fun. Yeah, no, it can be. - Can you cry on cue. - Can I cry on cue? No, I'm not that good at crying per se. No tears rolling down face, but I can feel the emotions and you see my eyes well up. I can do a British accent. Can you share it. He's as mad as a box of frogs! She's a picnic short to my sandwich! That was good, that was good. You ever thought about acting? No, I'll leave that to people with talent. I bet you'd be pretty good at it. There's this acting exercise that we do that kind of like, I don't know, helps you warm up and even get to know somebody a little better. Would you be interested in trying something like that with me? It's not as scary as it sounds. And if it gets too weird, you can always say, "You know, hey, I'm good." All right, so the rules are pretty simple. I'll say something about you from my perspective, and then you'll repeat back what you hear from your perspective. Okay, so you are sitting still. I am sitting still. - You are sitting still. - You're sitting still. - I'm sitting still. - You're very uptight. I'm very uptight. Yeah, you're very uptight. - You're judging me. - Yeah, I'm judging you. Isn't that the point of the game? - You're cheeky. - I'm cheeky. - You're cheeky. - You're open. I'm open. You question that. - I question that. - You're questioning yourself. I'm questioning myself. You're scared. I'm scared. You're scared. I'm scared. You're scared. I'm scared. You're scared. I'm scared. It's scary. It's scary. It's scary. I feel safe with you. You feel safe with me. And it looks like it's a lot for you to take in. There's a lot to take in? It feels like it's a lot for you to take in. No, it's not. It's not? Nope, I feel safe with you too. You feel safe with me too. I feel safe with you too. And I like you. And I like you. You like me. I like you. You like me. I like you. You like me. I like you I like you. You like me. Yeah, I like you. You like me. We're couple of goofballs. We're goofballs who like each other. We're couple of goofballs who like each other. We're couple of goofballs who like each other. We're couple of goofballs. This gonna be deck, it's gonna be amazing. I've started talking to myself. Oh, no. So like on that mental chatter that's normally on the inside of your head, started to come out now? Yeah. I think I'm going a little kooky. I've been cooped up for way too long. You never sneak out to the park or anything? No, no. I am of the camp that this is very serious. I mean, aren't you? I mean, no, not at first. Not really, but yeah. It's starting to sink in. My mother has the virus. Oh. How? Is she a- - She's a nurse. She got it in the second wave. Is she in the hospital now? No, she didn't wanna go. She didn't wanna take away a bed, from somebody that needed it more than she does. So she's okay, she's going to be okay, they think? Yeah, yeah. She's gonna be, she's gonna be fine. She's yeah, she's, yeah. Wow. What's it like up-close, if you don't mind me asking. It's terrifying, seeing someone you love go through this, you know. I've been helping my dad look after her. You know, they live just down the street from me. So that's been really good for them. We're making sure everyone's safe though. We're following all the protocols, and staying healthy, and I hope this doesn't scare you. No, no, not at all. I just, wow, your mom's a hero. I don't know. I feel like I can't believe that this is happening. 'Cause like one day we were all fine and- - It's pretty weird. I'm so sorry. I thought I could, I really thought I could. Well, continue. Okay, well, daddy, you really shouldn't be going to the grocery store. You can order them online now. I did order them online. Now, I gotta go pick them up. You don't have to pick them up, find somebody else to pick them up. Don't you have some friends at church. I'm not gonna ask somebody else to pick them up. Then I'll ask, let me call. Let me make a call. I can think of at least two people who would be happy to help you out, Dad. They're ready now, so I'm gonna go get them. I'm not going to bother somebody else, put them in that risk so I'm gonna go get them. Putting yourself at risk, where's your mask? Where's your glove? Hey, good morning. Good morning. I woke up on the wrong side of bed this morning, a lot of negative chatter and I've just been kinda dancing it out. It's kinda like my way of, I don't know, just processing stuff. I was wondering if you'd like to maybe join me for a little dance off. - Okay, sure. - Yeah. Awesome. Let me send you a song and you can find your headphones and yeah, let's give it a try. Okay, signed myself a spot and- - All right, I just sent you the song. - Okay, okay - All right. So one, two, three, go, - hit play and go. - Okay. - You ready? - Yes. One, two, three, go. You got some more of those in there, let it go. Okay. Do you think this is the future of dating? I'm worried that this is the end of all hugs as we know it. What if we just, like sniffed each other's butt from now on. Or better yet, if we start, like peacocking it. Oh, that's peacocking? Come on, you dig this, right? - Okay. - You want me. - You want me so bad. - Stop, stop, stop. - You want this so bad. - Oh yeah, yeah. Look at macaroni and cheese all over your tongue. Well, the other peacocks stuff for- - Hey, hey, so I'm just thinking about your play earlier. Oh, cool, what about it? Yeah, so I know it's kind of depressing, but this guy, he gets stuck in his car and he calls his wife and they spend his last moments together. It's kind of sweet and heartbreaking. He dies though. Yeah, he dies. So they talk about depressing shit for two hours and then he dies. Yeah, it's more about just, you know, all the stuff you think about when you're facing death. I guess I just like stories that have a happy ending, even if that's not the way that real life goes. So you write about relationships, huh? Predominantly, yeah. Have you ever been married? Hell yeah, but she wizened up. I bet there's more to that story. How about you, ever married? I had a close call once. Oh yeah, who's he? That dentist. And he started fucking a dental hygienist though. Typical. Other than that, I guess you could say I was married to my career, which like almost literally broke my back. Teaching? No, no. I used to play soccer. Oh, cool, like back in college? No, I played for the Washington Spirit. You're a pro? You've been sitting on that this whole time. I would have led with that. It's different when it's your job, and then suddenly it's not. I literally just had another surgery like six months ago. How are you doing now like with your back? We were just dancing to that. I mean, it's fine. People can dance, right? Yeah, it's the end of the world, so we gotta dance. So Jason, do you know what you're looking for? Yeah, I think I'm looking for a buddy for the apocalypse. Yeah, but beyond that. I guess I just want somebody who just makes me feel good and I make them feel good too. You know, someone who could help me forget that the world might possibly be ending out there, just for a minute. Somebody to fall asleep with while watching a movie? That sounds really nice. So are you talking to anybody else right now? Online? Yeah, I'm talking to three other guys. How about you? Yeah, I'm probably talking to two other people right now. Cool. You're okay? How's your couscous? It's good. So did you got weird there at the end? Yeah, kind of did. Didn't it? Yeah. I mean, we both kinda got weird though. Okay. What? I just felt like you got weird when I said I was talking to other guys. Yeah, I mean, I know that people see other people, when they're first dating, - and it makes sense. - Yeah, I mean, you're a good looking guy. It makes sense that you would be. No. I'm sorry, I keep making this awkward. I don't mean to make it awkward. Yeah. I wanna touch your face. Yeah. Go for it. Yes. Yes. You're kind of fun. You're pretty awesome yourself. Hey, what was that? That thing that you taught me the other day, the thing with all the repeating, the acting exercise. They call it repetition. Oh, duh. I appreciate you showing that to me. I appreciate you. You appreciate me. I appreciate you. I appreciate you. You appreciate me? Yeah. I've been trying this practice where you kinda repeat a mantra, affirming self-love, basically. Yeah, I'll say, "Jason, I love you." "Jason, I love you." I'll just keep doing that until I actually believe it. Seems like a really good exercise to do. Yeah. I think it's important to love yourself. I feel like I won't be safe for human consumption, until I like really love myself, you know? Yeah. Yeah, I feel like the only way to live is to love yourself, but it is hard, especially, you know, like we teach ourselves to like, not love ourselves. And the dentist, you remember him? The one with the cheating hygienists? Yeah, I found out about him and her the day of my last surgery. It was like six months ago, you know? That's fucked. Everyone teaches you how to beat yourself up, but no one teaches you how to put yourself back together. Yeah. You know what? What? I'm gonna get off of the dating app. Yeah, me too. I'll get off all of them. Good. Because I choose you as my apocalypse buddy. I choose you too. You wanna stay on here with me tonight? Yes. You don't snore, right? I can turn this down a little bit. Goodnight. Goodnight. I can't stop thinking about this woman, and it's not loneliness. I like being alone. I just think there's something about her. Like, it feels easy to just be my normal way of self around her. But we've never met in person, so what if we met and she didn't like me or I didn't like her or the chemistry was off? That could happen, and that would be okay. And I'll but I don't know, this feels good. I mean, she's my apocalypse buddy. Maybe distance love is somehow easier than face-to-face because without all the obvious distractions that come with touch, you know, the soul-to-soul contact really shines through. And I don't know, that's when the connection feels real. I wanna hold you. I would like that. Anything else you'd like? I'd like to kiss you. I'd like that. I'd like to run my fingers through your beautiful hair. I'd like to find every possible way to make you smile that beautiful smile. I wanna touch your beard. - So you liked beards? - Yeah. Beards or they're not? Yeah, I like beards. Yeah, you look very nice with the beard, yeah. What's your favorite part of a woman's body. Right now, I can't stop thinking of your That's a good, that's a good part of a woman's body, I think. What if we meet? Yeah, what if. No, no, I'm serious. What if we meet tomorrow? Like in real life? Yeah, yeah, I mean, we won't touch. We'll want to, but like, we can like, you know, be far away from each other. Okay, yes. So person. Yes, let's do this. We can save each other's butts. I'm much better at peacocking when I'm in the park in my natural habitat. Okay, okay. So- - Do you wanna meet at the park? What park? There's a good one, a good park not too far from my apartment. Okay, perfect. I have an appointment in the morning, but we can meet up noon, yeah. Noon, noon works. Great. I'm not gonna be able to sleep tonight. I can't wait. Oh it's even hard not to touch you. Hey Sorrel, it's been about 47 minutes now and I'm just gonna assume you're not coming. So yeah, hope you're okay. Give me a call when you get this, bye. You've reached Sorrel's phone, I am not available right now, but if you leave me a message, I'll get back to you when I can, bye. Hey, hey, it's me again. I'm just checking to make sure that you're okay. And I'm sure you are, I was a little awkward hanging out there for 45 minutes or so, I should have asked what car you drove. 'Cause I was looking at every car that drove by me thinking it might be you. Hey, dad. Hey, Jay. How are you feeling? Well, that's why I called. I've been feeling pretty crappy, the past few days, and I went in and got tested and I have it. They're sure you have it? I have all the symptoms and I tested positive, so. Dad, all you had to do was stay put. Yeah, yeah, but here we are. And it's not too bad. Nah, yeah. Look, I'm coming home tomorrow morning. No, no, stay where you are. Guess. Brian's on his way. And I can come too. Well, you don't have to do though. It's gonna be fine. You can't go to the store for me now, okay? I have, so it's too late. Not your fault, but it's too late for you to do anything. You don't need to put yourself at risk. Besides I want you to finish your play. Dad, who cares about the play? Well, you do. It's important to you. It's important to your mom. And I know I have not been encouraging, but I want you to finish it. I don't care. You're not my cup of tea, okay? You don't need to like my work. It's not that, it's not that. - You write love stories. - Yeah. There's a lot to your mom and you, and your voice, when you write about love. It's just too much. I just can't do it. So. Dad, why aren't you in the hospital? Well, like I said, I'm not that bad. And then hospitals, I just always think of your grandpa, "No, don't let them take him to the hospital, they'll only kill you." Dad, well, can you at least stay on with me for a little longer tonight? Yeah. What do you wanna do? What are we gonna talk about? Can you play me one of your songs? I got to do one. I'm gonna call this early flight. Dad. Dad! Dad. You okay? How are you feeling? Holy shit. Shit. Is Brian there yet? No, he's not here yet. Let me check the unless you call for me. - I'll call him now. - Yeah, yeah. I'll call you back. Hey dad, I think it might be time to go to the hospital, okay? Yeah. Yeah. - I'll call you back. - Okay. I love you. I love you, dad. Call me right back. - Yeah. - Okay. Hey, you've reached Komack Consultant. This is Brian Komack. Leave a message, and remember, Brian, where are you? You're supposed to be with dad. Give me a call. Hey, you've reached Komack Consultant. This is Brian Komack. Leave a message, and remember Brian, dude, dad needs to go to the hospital. Can you at least let me know where you are and if I need to call someone else? Hey, Sorrel. Jason again, sorry to keep calling you. Kate, I've got almost no battery left and I want you to tell the kids that I love them and I am sorry for all of my shortcomings. I did my best. I thought that work was the most important thing to just provide, you know? So that's what I did, that's my dad did. That's what I thought I was supposed to do. And more importantly, Kate, I love you. And, you're still the best thing that ever happened to me. And, and I love you. And our love was a win for me. It saved me so many times. Now, I'm stuck here in this fucking car, buried alive, that hurts to breathe. And I love you so much. And I'm sorry, because Kate, there's something I'd never told you. And I wanna tell you now before it's too late. I need to tell you when, Kate, no, no, no. - Jay. - Come on, man. Why aren't you on your way to dad? Dude, I clients, I couldn't ship around. You know, it's like I'm away. Where are you? Dude, I'm in Portland, you know that. Why are you not with dad? I had meetings. I have things I have to take care of over here, before I can just off and run to dad. You're still in Boston, Boston is five hours away. You know what, you know what? Some of us work for a living, I grind the grind. I'm a fucking hustler, all right? I can't just pack, get up and go. I'm doing what I have to do right now, take care of dad. Now, where the fuck are you, huh? You cross the goddamn country, riding this little fairy tale play. Fuck you, Brian. I've never hated someone like I hate you. Don't hate, and you don't mean that. Yes I do. Hey, look at me, baby. You don't mean that. Now, fuck you, yes I do. Jason, I wanna pay you back the money. I do, now, I wasn't forthcoming with you, all right? I made some bad decisions and I lost the spoken about money and I'm sorry. Dude, Brian, I don't give a shit, about the money right now, okay? You need to be with dad, like now. Mom, mom, let that money to both of us. Dude, I can't. Right now, I just can't, okay? What do you want from me, huh? You want the truth? Is that what you fucking want? You wanna hear the fucking truth, right? Well, here it is, man. Be ready for this fucking plan, this one on you bro, I'm fucking broke, right? I've got zero money, and you wanna know why you haven't seen Lucy and the kids in like a month and a half, huh? Because she fucking left me, right? You see this? You know this sheet right here, huh? It's a fucking protection order against me, so I can't see my fucking kids. Okay, that's the fucking truth, man, all right? It's like I can't pay for dad. Brian, I, look, if you're worried about the money I can probably, I can pay for things. I've been saving up for the play. I can. Thank you. Yes, thank you, Brian. - Okay. - Okay.

I tested positive yesterday and I just freaked out, and I couldn't, I just, I couldn't function. - I'm sorry. - No. - I'm sorry. - No, no, it's okay.
