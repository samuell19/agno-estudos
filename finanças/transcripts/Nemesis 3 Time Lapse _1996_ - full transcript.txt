The nebula has failed. You are the new generation of cyborg and you will succeed in capturing the DNA human. Alex Ramiee is the human's name. She is the first of the DNA mutants. Others have been created like her, but Alex's molecular structure is unique. She holds the secret to destroying the humans. Alex Ramiee must be captured. Alex, I have to leave you my love, I'm sorry. Please try to be quiet. Someday you'll return to our world. You have powers Alex. When you're ready Alex, this necklace will explain. I woke up and couldn't remember how I ended up how here. Couldn't remember what happened to me or even who I was. I found tracks. My tracks. They led from where I awoke to infinity. I decided to follow the tracks, hoping they would lead me back to who I was. Hello. Excuse me. Excuse me, sir. Look. I'm not armed. They're empty, didn't mean to scare you. You're not gonna kill me? I need your help. I know this sounds strange, but I don't know what's happened to me. How's that? I woke up in the middle of nowhere. I've been hurt. Can't remember anything. Amnesia? Go to the Jeep. Water. - What? I want some water. Let's go, in the Jeep. This man was strange, but there were many strange people in this part of Africa. The land attracted them. I knew if I were to have a chance at all, I'd have to take it with this odd man. What were you doing back there? I was in prayer. You don't talk like a rebel. A mercenary. I don't care about politics. I heard there was someone like you running around out here. What do you mean like me? - Somebody with your build. You know who I am? Not really. Just a sip. Didn't bring much. Here. Let me observe you. I've got some paramedic experience. Here. Bad? There. You were shot through the head. The bullet went in here and came to the other side. Grazed your brain. Shot in the head? Caused the amnesia. Am I all right? Apparently. Someone shot me in the head and left me to die? That's right. And the person who did it is right here in this Jeep. You. You. You. You put one of those pistols up to your head and shot yourself. Man. Do remember anything at all. My name is Farmsworth 2. Mean anything to you? Should it? Not really. Farmsworth 2. Unusual name. If you only knew. I'm going to give you a shot of Endo. It'll stop any infection. Hard muscle. How long before my memory comes back? Days, years, maybe never. What happened to your Jeep? - Fuel pump's shot. Got stuck out here in no man's land. There's no road out here. Driving to Zambezi. Thought it was a shortcut, guess not. Now I can't even turn off the damn engine. That Endo kicking in? You remember something? Colors. Shapes. Trace images. Your brain is trying to retrieve memory. The Endo's going to help that, help that, help that. I need to give you a full exam, full exam, full exam, exam, exam. Take off your clothes. No. Something's not right with you. I should check it out. If it's serious, I could do something about it. You're out here alone in the middle of nowhere. I'm all you got. Get away from me, I'll be okay. From the looks of it, you need attention fast. You think about it. Remember anything about your family? Your mother? How about your sisters, how many do you have? Do you know where they are? I don't know they I have any? Children? What children? Yours, have any. Children. You must procreate. Emily, Emily! I need more support to transport the DNA unit back to the captain. I'm stranded out here and everyone else is dead. I need help. No, she doesn't have a clue. She's lost her memory. I know. It is funny, but I don't know how long it's going to last. Send me some backup, transmitting coordinates. I realize my footprints led me to this Jeep. How's that? I was following the footsteps from where I woke up, they led me here. What a fucking coincidence. What do you think about those three pistols I had? I think you were lucky enough to have one that worked. My name is Ramiee. I'm your half sister. Have a good rest? Endo's working. You've got some color in your cheeks. Another six hours, you'll be just fine. Farmsworth 2, am I human? Believe me, you're human. I keep getting these flashes. Something's after me because of what I am. And there's shooting and killing. I'm killing. You don't look like a killer. I had pistols, that's it isn't it? I hope not. I'm called Alex. I think it's time we had that physical exam. There were 20 of us. We were given this necklace. Given this necklace hoping we might identify one another. Time is running out for the cyborgs and they are desperate to stop us. Where are the others now? Trying to stay hidden, waiting for you to return. I learned you were here in this time. I then stole a time capsule, hoping that our necklaces would help us find one another. We must procreate. Procreate. Procreate. Babies, have you had any? Can you remember your sister? More cyborgs left before I did. Elite retrieval teams led by Farmsworth 2. The cyborgs must never have the chance to do a full check on your DNA system. They believe your genes mutated into a stronger version of human DNA. Alex, you can destroy them. That's why they fear you. They're nearby Alex. Then let's leave for the future. No, it's too late. Farmsworth must never capture you. The Endo should have activated in your system. I needed to do a complete biopsy of your chemical structure. The cyborgs must never have the chance to do a full check on your DNA. So relax, Alex or I'll have to restrain you. Now you listen to me. Fuck! And meet back here in 24 hours. 24 hours. In 24 hours Alex. My memory came back in a rush. I remembered how it all happened. We would wait for the future. No, they could track us across time. We need to go back when the cyborgs are not around to follow us. For now, let's lead them away from the capsule. We'll split up and meet here in 24 hours. Alex. We must return here no later than 24 hours. There is a limited launch window. If we miss this, the next change is in one year. I'll be there. You're too late. Alex has escaped, she's returned to the future. Fuck, man, all right. My God. He's dead. Don't worry about him. What? What? You want all of it? I could have killed you and took to all for myself, but I didn't because I'm a, I'm a gentleman in any case. You're a hell of a fighter. I'm Edson. Who are you? You're a mercenary. Don't say it like it's a disease. I'm a professional soldier. Whoever pays me gets my gun. I'm looking for someone. Yeah, aren't we all. I haven't seen anyone around for a day or so. Even these rebels are the first I've met. I was with a squad of rebels that got into a fire fight with the young patrol. I got away, they didn't. That was three days ago, man. You ran. No, I didn't run. But I'm not paid enough by these piss ant rebels to die for them. Who the hell are you? Alex. Boy's name, figures. Lakintiko here, we've got human activity in our sector. Proceeding to investigate. Area's secure. Humans in area terminated, no sign of female. The other two teams are advancing on suspected last human positions in A7 quadrant 4. What are you doing around here Alex? Looking for my sister. Holy shise. There's another one that looks like you? Not exactly like me. She's being chased. By what? A man. He has white hair. Hey, Farmsworth, too bad you lost track of the other chick. Central command is not. You're a useless cyborg Bob. No one's gonna miss you except for Michael, of course. You know that don't you? Sure you do. Coming in close. Stay there. Alex, it's okay. This wouldn't have anything to do with that rumor about commandos having landed? What commandos? Everybody's been pulling back out of this area because there's supposed to be a commando team that's arrived to take out every rebel they can find. It's supposed to be a pretty scary bunch. Rebels say they have black magic or some voodoo powers. Who sent them? Them, I would think. The government doesn't have anything like that. I'm not sure they even exist. It sounds like a bunch of tribal rebel crap to me. These people will do anything not to fight. But I'm not waiting around here to find out. There's no money in that. - I'm... - Stop. I'm headed for Katonga. You can come along if you want. I wouldn't mind the company. Look, an hour ago, I heard some heavy fighting going on east of here. You gotta get out of this area. I have to find my sister before they kill her. If she was headed east, she's probably dead. Whatever is doing the killing is all over that sector. Wow. Where'd you get that? We can keep each other company, come on. I'll show you my stock collection. Where the hell did she go? God. That didn't work. All right, all right, all right, I give up. Whoa! You're not rebels, are you. Damn, we're wearing these shitty things for nothing. I've told Farmsworth it wouldn't work. Let's kill this human and move on. She's gotta be around. I've got a slight trace scan on her. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, you can't kill me. Why not. I know who you're looking for. I can help you find her. What do you think? I'm for anything that gets us back to our time. Where's Bob's Jeep? Where's Bob. Bob? Bob is dead. Central command has got to have an answer and a DNA human within the area. They need to know if the female's a DNA mutation. You tell central command that they can wait. I want to see Lock and Ditco, maximum priority. I want that human who said they saw the DNA female. Do we understand each other. Yes, sir. Everyone's pulling back to Katanga. These damn rebels think some kind of hit team has shown up. I don't care what they want me to do. Where's the goddamn water? So, Johnny. Things aren't so great nowadays? Hey, that's enough. Nothing like a little rain to knock you off your high horses. I told you I'd get you back someday, didn't I? You did. Clumsy retard. Look what you made me do. Hey, Break, what are you doing working with a retard. He's gonna get himself kill. Go drool somewhere else fathead. Got a problem? Well. Muscles. You're really put together. That's enough boys. Save it for the war. Pick up your friend and get out. We still got a patrol to finish. I'll be seeing you again bitch. We've got 18 hours or one of you is gonna spend the rest of the year here. Relax small man. She's somewhere in sector five. It's only a matter of time. Finding her and capturing her are two different matters. Maybe I didn't bring enough power to do the job. We're all you need boss. Don't blame us for Nebula Six's behavior. He was just some bounty hunter. It wasn't one of us. The female is not to be killed until we've done a full scan check of her, that means blood and tissue samples. Don't get carried away, especially you. It's gonna be difficult to run that kind of check in the field. It'll take 12 hours. We need to find out about her genes. We need to find out if she's different from the other DNA females. We need to find out if she's procreated. I want her body properly examined and phased back to our time intact. Are you saying we've been excessive in the past? I'm saying don't fuck this up. Cool your matrix. We'll head on out to the eastern sector. She's headed out there according to the human we snared. Where is this human? We sent him out to scout for us. He knows the area well and he can travel amongst the humans. You dizzy bitches let him go? Don't blow a fuse. We've got a tracer on him. When he finds something, so do we. And if he doesn't. We blow him up. Personally, I hope he tries to run. Family ties. Ladies. 18 hours. Come on, clean this up. I couldn't hear first. Who are you? Now I appreciate you standing up for Johnny here, but that doesn't change much. Who the hell are you? I'm not with the government. I don't care what you're not. I want to know who you are. Just passing through. To where? Wherever I find my sister. There's another one like you? Thanks for sticking up for Johnny. Break Bada. You've met Johnny. Howdy. Well, we have to be going now. We're what's left of the supply line. Wait, can I come along? I'm trying to find my sister and it'll be easier for me to search the rural areas if you're with me. I'm a girl all alone, it's dangerous. I don't think that's a problem for you. I'll work my way if I have to. All right, meet me out back. Come on Johnny, let's load up. The only thing you did right was track the female to this time. Xena, what have you found? Nothing, we've tested all the biogenetic traces the girl left on the nebula, but so far nothing unusual in her makeup. She's a fucking superwoman. We've got 18 hours to do the job. 18 hours? But the molecular specs you want are so complex. I said 18 hours or you will be practicing your archaic human skills in the slave camps. Do we understand each other? Yes. I don't know why we continue to use these human scientists. You needed our ability to execute abstract thought. Someday that will change. We haven't much time to find Alex. I told you we'd be seeing you again. Stupid retards, I'm gonna kill you. Stop it or I'll shoot you dead. Come on Johnny, we gotta go. He's dead. I'm sorry Johnny, we have to go. My friend. My only friend. I'm your friend now. You better deliver the water. Your friend would have wanted that, wouldn't he. Break always said that was most important. Come on, Johnny, let's go. Break would have wanted you to go. Wait! Was the rebel base close by? Yeah, close. Busy girl. We better clean them out. I'll have cousin Bob lock the road between here and Manka. She's somewhere between us. Let's just close this female out and go home. The sand's playing hell on my circuits. I have to find my sister. Maybe she's at your base or maybe someone's seen her. How do I get there? Good, the rebel lines. They are not two rebels. They are the bad things. Bad things. How did you know about them? I saw them land Alex. They came in little ships and killed everyone. Watch this. Come here. Who me? I won't hurt you. Some road block. They were here Alex, I promise. Gone now. We can find them. I know we will. Don't give up. It's not safe here in the open. The bad thing will be searching for us one day. I used used to be smart Alex. What? Smart, Break said I used to be smart until my head got hurt. He said I saved a lot of people's lives and I was a great soldier. You saved us back there. Break says I saved his life, too. That's why he was so nice to me. You're thinking the bad things have your sister. What is it? Stay here. Can't a guy shower in piece. You're alone? Hey, what's going on. I heard. Malloy. I'll be damned. I heard you were dead. And when we got here, no one was here. I swear. That's the truth, Mr. Edson. I'm sure it is Johnny. So what are your plans? Where you gonna go next? You mean after I kill you. You are relentless. Don't even. There's a hell of a lot of activity by these bad things. They're looking for someone. Not me, I hope not me. No, Johnny, I think they want Alex. Alex? Why? I don't know, why would they want you? I gotta pee. Be careful Johnny, keep quiet. I know. I won't let the bad things know I'm outside peeing. I can't believe it. He was a big hero. Saved a lot of lives. You know, he almost beat the government a few months ago, a real freedom fighter. What happened to him? He led an attack to free rebel families held in the prison camp, took a head injury in the operation. Just like that. That's too bad. He was an amazing soldier. Alex. What are you thinking? Come on, he's like a three-year-old now. Maybe he can be helped. Actually your friends might be able to. How do you know so much about them. Well, I had a few encounters with them. They say they're from the future here to find someone. All from the future and they'll kill anything that gets in their way. Africa's a strange place. You better go. Come on, it's all right. I'm not gonna hurt you. Just take your stuff and go. I'll keep this baby if you don't mind. I heard these bad things captured a woman. Your sister maybe? Where would they take her? There's a power plant on the western sector of the mine. They're using it as their command post. It's, you can't miss it. What about Johnny? I'll get him somewhere safe. Alex, be careful. Did Alex have to pee? Yeah. Alex had to pee. They should be over here. Hey. How about you and I getting the hell outta this twilight zone. Come on, we'll take the truck. I think I know a way through the government lines. Keep your eyes open Johnny. There's of those bad. I was just trying to find ya. Where's the female? The female, actually she was just here a minute ago. You wouldn't try to double cross us? Why would I do that? No, I don't think our human buddy would do that. They are the bad things Mr. Edson. And we're gonna do some very bad things to you if you don't tell us where the female is. Right behind you. God! Come on. They'll try to close off the sector. Let's go, come on. You sold me out. If I really wanted to sell you out, you'd be gone. I can't believe you think I'd pick these freaks over you, what do you take me for? Not much. Run! Go! The grenades in this area are messing with my optics. I hate this place. Got you babe. I mean we're not supposed to kill her, but a little shrapnel and fire won't kill her. Just enough to slow the bitch down. What are you gonna do? - I can do this. You're nuts. You I can kill. Damn uranium. I knew I could do this. I'm fixed. I kept going for this. You need some help. Not from you. What do you have against me? What did I ever do? I don't trust you. Well, excuse me for saving your life. Johnny saved us. Okay, I'm scum. Are all the girls like you where you come from? Yeah, only bigger. Boy. You still gonna try for their command post? Yeah, I'm gonna scout it. Let me do it. I know the sector. I'll find the best way for you to get in. Look, you're always checking the time. If you're on a schedule, I can help you keep it. Okay. After all this is over, I'd really like to. I'd rather the cyborgs catch me. Ouch. All right. See you around. You know Alex. I have feelings. How do you feel now? Very well, thank you. Where is Edson, gone? Scouting. Poor hard working Edson. Brain damage? But it doesn't hurt. You remember who you were? A little. But it seemed like it was another person. Like a brother. Back there you took out all those cyborgs. I don't know what came over me. I seemed to know what to do. Maybe you're healing. Maybe. Hi, human buddy. I don't deserve this. Listen, I was just looking for you babe. I like you Alex. What is it? Not right. I'm sorry. Not right Alex. Okay, Johnny, I'm sorry. They are coming for us. Where are they? Outside. Get dressed Johnny. Run Johnny! Alex! Alex! Well, that was easy. What about the dummy? As long as we got 'em, let's take him back to Farmsworth. Maybe the girl told him something useful. And an area search revealed no sign of her body. I told you I wanted her alive. We really tried, honest. Now what do we do? We needed to know if she had children. We needed to know if she was a mutant. We needed to know why she was different from all the other DNA females we've killed. Well, at least we know she can die like the others. Do we really know that girls? I'd stake my implants on it. You have. I want Michael to control the rest of the site. We've got 11 hours left. You two dredge the wreckage. Every fucking centimeter of it until you find the remains. I want specimens for testing. Looks like we screwed up. Let's fix it. What are you to Alex? He's nothing to Alex. It's me you want. Listen, I'll make you a deal. What? I'll make you a deal, okay? Alex isn't dead. She's coming to kill you. You're in for a surprise. Hey, Johnny. Maybe next time you'll be the hero? There's still activity in the nebula's remains. Where have they taken Johnny. Farmsworth's got him at command, but I don't think you're gonna like what's left of them. I don't think you're gonna like what's left of you. I'm not telling you shit. I don't want your shit. I want your molecules. Your brain is a mess son. Yours is a toilet. Where is your sister Alex? What are you doing with these two excuses? Get out. I don't think so Farmsworth. I thought you were too smart to be true. I am, step away from Ramie. She's mine. These bounties are mine. I found them. I'm collecting the reward. You fucking nebula, you won't get away with this. Seven hours left. Looks like you're gonna be stuck here for the next year. Think they'll trust me enough to lead me to where the others are hiding. They'll see right through you. Not until it's too late. After I rescue them, they'll be too thankful to notice for a while. I deactivated the Endo. It'll take a few seconds to wear off. We need to find Alex and return to our time. We'll soon be safe. You're looking at my necklace, why? What's wrong? Look what your sister did to my implants. The human's way too excessive. What does she think she is? A cyborg. Why don't we all just wait for her. I'm sure she'll be along soon. We're dead. Sorry, I took so long. It's all right. Can you do something here? Get on. Come on Alex, before they come back to life. Sister. Of course I am Alex. Look, the necklace. Come on, we don't have much time left. We have to get back to the capsule. What happened? Where's Ramie? And Xena? And Edson and Johnny? I can't remember anything more. What happened? What happened? Come on, wake up! What happened? Where is everybody? Unh! I remembered all I could. All else was hidden. In my heart I knew the answers lie in the future. The future. Where everything was waiting.
