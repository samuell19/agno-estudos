You fucking asshole! Maycon, you said that after work you'd swing by to pick up Malu. Tomorrow I have some cleaning work on the other side of town! Do me a favor and come by tomorrow morning? Hold on. Let's fix it. Spread your legs. Right... Put your hand up close to the chin. This will rotate, rotate and hit the right jab. It's going to connect and return. Right? Good... So... What's up? I'm fine. How long has it been since you last fought? About two and a half years. Gotta train harder, man... This ain't working. Got it? Gotta be here everyday. I work, dammit. I'm doing what I can. I know. But this is your job as well and you've chosen it too. Don't worry, everything will be fine, OK? If anything comes up, just give me a call. OK, thanks. - Bye, bye! - Bye! Bye. Shall we go? Sorry I'm late. Mr? Maycon. Mr. Maycon, I need you to bring us all of these documents. This one, this, and this, and this. And also that you fill in this registration form to enter the waiting list. Wow... there's a waiting list? Yes. There is a waiting list. But it is important that you bring all the documents so we can start it here. And we need everything about the father and the mother. Oh, from the mother won't be possible, I'm afraid. Oh sorry, you have custody of the girl? - Come again? - Her custody, is it settled? No... I have her birth certificate, is it enough? No, it's not. That won't work, sir. You must go to the family court, settle the whole situation. And then bring it back here. With the protocol, we can start the registration process. I will sort that out. How long does it take after that? No way to know for sure... But usually it takes a while. Fine. Thanks, ma'am. You're welcome. Let's go, Malu. Shall we? Vanderlei! Hey, Vanderlei! Yo, man... come in! The gate is open, dude. - Hey, what's up? - You good? Look how much she's grown, huh? Come on in. So, how are things at the restaurant? Yuri didn't call me again... Same old shit, man. It's been weak these last days... So, I thought about that thing at the nightclub... Want one? Oh... did you? Yeah... So how does it work over there? You tell me to to go fuck myself and now ask me how it works? Actually, it's a little secretive. It's a couple's thing. But there's always a third one involved, right? Like us. But does everybody know that? Yeah... It's kinda part of the house, bro. So you arrive, exchange some glances... Hook up with a cougar and see how it goes. - What up, yo? - It's not that hard. 'Sup, brother? You're cool? There's a lady over there who wants to meet you. Yeah? Yeah, dude! “Meet”... Come on over. That one over there. She's hot, right? Go on. - Hi. - Hi! Gin? Thanks. How old are you? Thirty three. Are you having a good time? So far, I'm cool. "I'm cool?" Where's that accent from? From Pernambuco. Ah... Pernambuco! Delicious... I love that accent. My name is Leila. - Maycon. - Maycon... And this is Flávio... My husband. Hello there, how are you? I haven't seen you in here before. This is my first time. Are you a virgin? Keep at it, man! C'mon Maycon, continue! It's hard, I can't... Look... We pay, and you do it. Simple as that. What a gorgeous young lady! Hey, there's a guy about to arrive: Ramiro. OK. He shares the house with me.. Just so you don't get scared. Ah, OK... So, all of her stuff is here in the bedroom. There are more toys over there. Look... I wrote down here the time for her bottle, her snack, those kinds of things. Later you can drop some saline in her nose. OK? OK. Let's play? Come here. What are you going to tell me? Go, let's play cooking! Let's cook for fun? Oh, okay then. Let's play with the monkey. Whose monkey is it? It's Malu's. Look at the little food! What are we going to eat? You stir here and I stir here? Get this little pot here, look. Yummy, do you want some? I do. Bye, Malu. Say goodbye to daddy! What are we going to do? We'll make rice? That's beautiful!

Are you Maycon? - Yeah, I'm Maycon. - I'm Julia. - Julia! Hi! Say hi to her! Let's go. Thanks. Excuse me... Look, make yourself at home. You can put your things in the room that was your father's. All right, OK. It's very strange being here... Like, my dad is the guy who married my mother, you know? Who raised me and... She told me to come because he was my biological father. So I came, but I don't know... I don't feel anything, do you get it? I'm going to take my college admission exam this year. Yeah, he told me... Yeah. And the Federal University opens in about a month. So I was kind of thinking about staying here until then... I wanted to know if It was OK to stay at your place. Like, I'll help you with what you need, cleaning the house and stuff... Of course, of course. You can stay. The house is yours. Thanks. Turn low. Right... Direct! There! Good, rest. Come on, let's weigh you. Stand still. - Still have to loose five kilos, dude. - Five? I can do it. Hey! Shall we go to Londrina? There's a guy in your weight down there. Have to sweat now, huh? Thanks! Hello! Yeah. Of course I can! That's fine. OK, then. See you. Thanks! Guys! - What is that child doing here? - She's my daughter, Yuri. In such short notice, I had to bring her. My apologies. Are you going to bring a child to the restaurant, man? It was the only way man, she is quiet over there. Fuck you man, this is a restaurant! If they see me with this girl here, they'll close the whole restaurant, man! No need for cursing, It's just a kid. What are you going to do? Are you going to hit me? Get this brat out of here and scram! Watch how you talk about my daughter, you piece of shit! You can get your things, man, and you're fired! Any sucker can wash the dishes! - Hi. - Hi... So, did you have dinner? I ate at a restaurant down the street. The food was good. Nice. Hey, Maycon. Could you give me the internet password? I looked for it here and didn't find it. Shit, I don't know the password. Ramiro was the one who registered that password. It connects automatically. I don't even know how to work these kinds of things. OK... But I think I can reconfigure it. May I? Sure... Go for it. OK, but what password should I put then? Gee... I don't know! OK, I'll figure something out. Cool. Gonna take my shower. OK. - Hello. - Hi... How are you? This is Maycon, who I told you about. - How are you? - Fine. Go get something for you to drink. All right, let's get out of the tub? We're done, shall we? - Let's get out, of the tub, Malu? - No! - I'm gonna wash my hands. - Take it! Daddy is wet! - Good morning! - Good morning. - Maycon? - That's right. - May I talk to you for a minute? - Sure. Thank you. - Good morning. - Are you the mother of the child? No! She is a friend of mine who's spending a few days here. - It's Malu! It's Malu! - Uh, OK... It's Malu. Uh, OK. Mr. Maycon, the reason for my visit... Is that we have received a report of maltreatment. Towards a minor. What is the child's name? Maria Luíza dos Santos. Maltreatment... Whose complaint? The complaint is anonymous, sir. Do you accept some water or coffee? I'll take some water. Thank you. Mr. Maycon, When we receive a complaint, we head to the person's residence to see how things are going. How is your relationship with the girl's mother? She left. Left? How so? Well, that's all I know. She left. And how have you managed ever since? Well, I am handling it. I do what I can... Do you already have custody of the girl? Not yet. I've started the process, still waiting for the documents. Have you taken her to the doctor? Yes, I have. I take her to the health center near here. Do you take her to daycare? No, I couldn't get a spot, no. I tried now in the middle of the year, but there was no vacancy. - Just for the next year. - OK... And what is your profession? I teach boxing lessons at the gym. OK... Mr. Maycon, I'm making some notes here in the report. As soon as you receive custody of Maria Luíza, Look for me at the Child Welfare Agency. Today is just a visit to know if everything is fine, if everything is OK... Didn't the child's mother speak anything? Didn't she say something? - Are they trying to take my daughter away? - No, I didn't say that... It's standard procedure. Your situation will be analyzed. If you think everything's fine, you've got nothing to worry about. OK? Thank you for the water. And have a nice day. Close the gate after you. Do you want me to lose my daughter? You Disgusting fuck! - I don't know what you're talking about. - Yes you do! Stay away from my daughter, you hear me? Stay away from my daughter, you piece of shit! Yeah, hold it... Let me see. - I'm gonna take a picture. - Are you taking my picture? - Oops, it fell! - It fell, hold it. - Sadi! - Over here. - Hey, what's up? - Yeap. So I came here to find out if that proposal is still standing. What proposal? That you wanted to buy my motorcycle. That was a long time ago, kid. What? Have you changed your mind? 'Cause... with my daughter now, I'm not even using it. - I didn't even know you had a daughter. - I do, man. Here, look. Maria Luiza. How much do you want for this crap? Three grand and I sell it. Three grand... fuck no! Are you crazy? I'm gonna have to disassemble and sell the parts. I'll pay two grand, tops. Two grand, Sadi? The motorcycle is working fine, brand new! Okay, let me take a look. That's some good looking dish! Help yourself. I'll serve Malu's. What's it called? The dish? Potatoes with meat! Aren't you going to eat? I can't. What do you mean, you can't? I'm going to fight in a few days and I'm overweight. Well... It's a shame because... This is fucking delicious! My bad! - Plane? - What? Plane? - Plane! - It's the plane! Another one? It's over! You ate it all! Now tickle Grandma! Well Sandra, I have to go now. All her things are here, everything is set. Her toys and everything. If you need anything just call me.
