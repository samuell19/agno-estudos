Being Ulaganathan's son, I asked him to name my new born baby Anbu named my baby Elizabeth Taylor, sir Should a tailor's daughter become only a tailor? 'Look at his wicked thought' Sir, more than everything Our dear Ulaganathan sir Must be about 5 feet, sir That British fellow pushed him in a 5' hole in front of all our people And stamped him flat as a 'dosa', sir He pushed our sir who loves his motherland in mud and muck I couldn't bear that sight, sir Sir, they are enacting a drama What?

Taking the uncommon nature of this incident into account With the responsibility of maintaining law & order Anbu's love being the root cause of all distress and disorder It has been temporarily banned [shouts of consensus] It has been decided to exile Anbu from our town This is injustice, sir The disputed land should be given to Boopathy - 'What you've decided is unjust, sir' - Which? Which century are we in? How can you exile me? Wait...wait We had a similar case in the neighboring State, sir A boy like Anbu was causing trouble and he was sent out of his home town Suppose I disregard your verdict because he is pleading If someone in this crowd throws a stone on his father's head - Of course, sir - Only my head will roll! - Understood our problem? - This is injustice, sir - Don't do this, sir - Escort him Escort him carefully 'He may take the girl with him' 'So escort him alone' I want to talk to him Anbu Do you still think you can live in this village? You know I'm not against Anbu now But there's no respect for us here I've completely lost hope That's why we are leaving 'Uncle' I need to talk to you for a few minutes You are justified in hating us We British have shown immense violence against Indians Treated Indians like slaves Decades have passed and still that hatred remains My grandma told India always hugs everyone India gives life, she believes But looks like I am not that fortunate, uncle Such a kind person like Anbu I never thought I would lose him because of a senseless feud All I believed was Anbu would be my life partner through thick and thin But I didn't think he would remain as a mere memory These are our original land documents, uncle And one more thing, uncle For all the injustice you have had to face because of us all along On behalf of all British people On behalf of everyone who stood as a reason for this Sorry, uncle Sorry I am reporting 'live' from Devanakottai limit To watch this incident of exiling Anbu from our town A whole village is assembled here You are watching that now Let's ask this elderly gentleman here - Are you at least on Twitter? - Sir Hello, City Cable Has such an event happened many times earlier also?

Bottle gourd is 'sorakkai' 'Sorakkai' Sir, first send him out of our village border Border? Do you know when I first heard of the word 'border'? My neighbor aunty came and asked my mother 'Akka, I like your sari border' 'Is mine as good?' she asked That's the first time I heard that word All I know is only that border Even a 'veshti' has a border I don't know any other border 'Correct, brother' 'Border shouldn't exist at all it only creates problems' - Who is that? - Me, bro Come here, brother - Coming - Move, sir - Tell them about the border issue - What is it you want me to say?

Didn't I tell your name? What is this? What is he saying? I was sent out of school because I questioned my teacher too much Sent me out of college because I copied I was sent out of the theater when the movie ended Now you are exiling me from my home town because I fell in love You don't like intelligent people It was Socrates then My turn today! - Enough!

I'll forget the question by the time he answers I have given you my answer Anyway it is your turn now 'Answer boldly' How do we answer this boy's question? He is using a new word 'humanity' People of our caste support 'humanity' 'Vimanity!!' Why should we copy whatever they say? Let's choose the opposite 'Patriotism!' Stop it! Would you be casteist even in humanity vs patriotism? Beyond caste, color, region, religion When will you look at a human being with a humanitarian outlook? When will you get that humanity? We will get it only if we know what that blessed word means!
