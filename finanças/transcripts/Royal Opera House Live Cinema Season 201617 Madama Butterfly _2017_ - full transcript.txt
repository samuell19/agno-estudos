And ceiling and walls... ...slide back and forth... ...giving a different look to the same space Where's the bridal suite? That's up to you More sleight of hand! - The living room? - Here Outside? One panel glides... I see - And another... - ...slides The whole play-house... Rock solid, from floor to ceiling A house made of air This is the maid, who's already serving your bride The cook, the house-boy - They're a little overwhelmed - Names? Wisp of Cloud Rising Sun Scented Breeze Is Your Honour smiling? Ocunama said, "Troubles fade at a smile" A smile opens the gate to paradise Perfume of the gods, the fountain of life Ocunama said, "Troubles fade at a smile" All over the world women witter on like that - What are you looking at? - To see if the bride is on her way - So everything's ready? - Everything What a perfect marriage broker! We'll be joined by the Registrar, the relatives... ...your consul, and the bride You sign the contract and then you're married Are there lots of relatives? Bride's mother, granny, her uncle, the Bonze... ...who won't be deigning to attend Between cousins and others... ...let's say two dozen As for descendants... ...Your Honour and lovely Butterfly will provide What a perfect marriage broker! Clambering in this heat, out of breath, stumbling The Consul's here Those pebbles have finished me off Welcome Some refreshments, Goro - It's high up - But it's beautiful Nagasaki, the sea, the harbour And a little house you conjure out of nothing - Yours? - I bought it for 999 years But I can break the contract any month Here, houses and contracts are equally flexible - And the smart man takes advantage - Sure The carefree American is all over the world... ...doing deals and having a good time He drops anchor wherever he lands up A milk punch or a whisky? He drops anchor wherever he lands up... ...until his ship is hit by a squall He's not satisfied unless he's acquired every treasure... Quite a casual gospel ...and the love of every pretty girl A casual gospel... ...that makes for an easy life but leaves a sadness in your heart If he takes a knock, he picks himself back up again His talents work wherever he goes So I'm marrying Japanese-style for 999 years - With a monthly get-out - Quite a casual gospel America for ever! Is the bride pretty? A garland of fresh flowers, a beam of golden starlight And all for 100 yen If you're interested, I have a wide range... Go and get her What's got into you? Are you so utterly in love? I don't know. It depends what type of love I couldn't say if it's love or an infatuation But she's certainly captivated me with her innocent ways She's as delicate as a glass figurine She looks like one of those figures on a screen Then suddenly she steps out from that shiny lacquer background Like a butterfly, she lands with silent gracefulness Then I have to pursue her... ...even if I damage her wings She came to the Consulate the other day I didn't see her, but I heard her speak I was struck by the sound of her voice She sounded like someone truly in love It would be a terrible thing to tear off her wings... ...and maybe break a trusting heart You're a kind man... ...but don't get carried away People of your age tend to take a bleak view - Where's the harm... - That timid little voice... - ...in guiding her towards love? - ...should never utter a sad word - Whisky? - Another glass Here's to your family back home And here's to the day when I have a proper wedding... ...with a proper American bride They've arrived at the top of the hill I can hear their girlish chatter, like rustling leaves Boundless sky, boundless sea One more step. Wait The joyful breath of spring wafts over land and sea The happy chatter of youth! I'm the happiest girl in Japan, no, in the world My friends, I've answered the call of love I stand at the threshold of love... ...where joy awaits all the living and all the dead My friends, I've answered the call of love We've arrived B. F. Pinkerton. Bow - May fortune smile on you - Our respects Was the climb a little hard? For a well-mannered bride, impatience is more taxing What an exquisite compliment I know more lovely ones Gems, I'm sure - If you'd like... - No, thank you Miss Butterfly, your name suits you to perfection Are you from Nagasaki? Yes, sir, from a family that was once prosperous Isn't that so? That is so No one ever admits to being born poor Every vagabond boasts of illustrious forebears I was once wealthy, but the wind can topple the strongest oak And we earned our living as geishas - Didn't we? - We did I'm not ashamed to admit it Does that make you laugh? Why? It's the way of the world The way she talks excites me - Do you have any sisters? - No, I have my mother A distinguished lady But unfortunately very poor And your father? Dead - How old are you? - Guess - Ten - Higher - Twenty - Lower Fifteen exactly, old already Fifteen! - The age for playing - And getting married The Imperial Commissioner, the Registrar, the relatives Hurry it along What a comedy, this line-up... ...of my sale-or-return family That must be my mother-in-law lurking behind that fan And that down-and-out is the crazy, drunken uncle She thinks she's better than you because he chose her - They'll divorce - Let's hope so She's lost her looks Could you please keep the noise down! - Is there any wine? - Let's have a look I saw some, the colour of crimson tea Goro offered him to me but I said no He couldn't be more handsome, he's like a king! Could you please keep the noise down! You're a lucky man, Pinkerton Yes, she's like a flower Her exotic fragrance has turned my head I've never seen a lovelier girl than this Butterfly Her trust, and the contract may seem a joke to you... ...but watch out, they're real to her Come here, Mummy. Listen One, two, three, everyone bow Come, my love Do you like the little house? Mr B. F. Pinkerton, forgive me... May I... a few things - Where are they? - Here. Do you mind? Of course not, my lovely Butterfly Handkerchiefs, a pipe A sash, a clasp, a mirror, a fan - That jar? - Rouge - Oh no! - Don't you like it? Away! - What's this? - This is sacred for me Can't I see it? There are too many people. Forgive me The Mikado sent it to her father, inviting him... - And her father? - Obeyed Hotoke What did you call these puppets? They're the souls of my ancestors Oh, my respects Yesterday, I went to the Mission all alone, in secret With my new life I can adopt a new religion My uncle, the Bonze, doesn't know, nor does my family I follow my destiny... ...and bow before Mr Pinkerton's god It's my destiny Kneeling at your side in the same little church... ...I shall pray to the same god To make you happy I'd even forget my own people My only love! Silence, everyone Permission is granted to Benjamin Franklin Pinkerton... ...lieutenant on the gunboat Lincoln of the US Navy... ...North America... ...and the young woman Butterfly, of the Omura district, Nagasaki... ...to join in matrimony. He of his own free will She, with the consent of her relatives, here as witnesses The bridegroom Then the bride It's all done Madam Butterfly Madam B. F. Pinkerton Best wishes Thank you - Is the Consul going down? - I'll come with you - See you tomorrow - Fine - May you have many children - I'll see what I can do Be careful At home with the family! Let's get this over with, but decently - O Kami! - A toast to our new bond Cio-Cio-San! Abomination! The Bonze Can we get rid of this killjoy? What did you do at the Mission? - Answer, Cio-Cio-San - What's this madman on about? Answer, what did you do? How can you not be in tears? Is this the outcome? She has disowned us all Disowned our ancient religion Kami Sarundasico! Your soul is in mortal danger That's enough of that! Everyone come with me. She has disowned us And we disown you Get out at once I'm not having any mumbo-jumbo in my house Don't cry, little one, over those croaking frogs They're still shrieking All the Bonzes in Japan... ...aren't worth a single tear from your lovely eyes Really? I won't cry any more. I almost don't care... ...because of your words that sound so sweet What are you doing to my hand? I was told that over there... ...this was the highest sign of respect Who's that mumbling? It's Suzuki saying her evening prayer - Night is falling - Darkness, and peace - You're here alone - Alone and rejected... Rejected... ...and happy Close up Yes, just us two - Shut out the world - And the raging Bonze Suzuki, my robes Good night I've been longing to take off this sash She squirrels out of her dress To think this plaything is my wife! He's smiling and watching - But she has such grace... - I'd like to hide away ...that I'm suddenly gripped by desire That angry voice is still cursing me Rejected Butterfly Rejected, and happy Child with those spell-binding eyes, now you're all mine I love the sight of your dark hair ...against your white robes I'm like the goddess of the moon... ...who comes down from the night sky To capture hearts And wrap them in a white cloak Then she takes them back into the realm above But in all this time you still haven't said you love me Does the goddess know the words that satisfy burning desires? She might not want to say them in case they mean her death A foolish fear, love doesn't kill It brings life and smiling, heavenly joy As it does now, in your wide, almond eyes You're now the centre of my universe I liked you the moment I saw you You're tall and strong, you laugh without a care You say things I've never heard before I'm happy now Love me, just a little The way you love a child Love me Here we're used to little things... ...quiet and subtle affections... ...but boundless as the sky and deep as the sea Let me kiss those hands I love My fragile Butterfly, so well named I heard that overseas, if a butterfly falls into the hands of man... ...it's pierced with a pin... ...and fixed to a board There's a bit of truth in that, and do you know why? To stop it flying away again I hold you, fluttering in my grasp. You're mine - For ever - Come to me Cast out the fear you feel in your heart It's a peaceful night. Look, the whole world's asleep - Soft night - Come to me I've never seen the stars look so lovely Come, it's a peaceful night Look, the whole world's asleep Soft night. I've never seen the stars look so lovely Each star is twinkling like an eye - All those eyes looking down... - I hold you, fluttering in my grasp ...looking down from the heavens, over the shores, over the sea - The heavens are smiling - Look: the whole world's asleep Ecstatic with love, the heavens are smiling Izanagi, Izanami, Sarundasico, Kami Oh, my head! Tensho Kodai... ...make Butterfly never cry again The Japanese gods are fat and lazy I'm sure the American god answers prayers much more quickly But I'm afraid he doesn't know we're here Suzuki, will we soon be destitute? This is all we have left We've spent too much If he doesn't come back soon, we're ruined - But he is coming back - He is Why else would he get the Consul to pay the rent? Tell me that Why take such care with the locks... ...if he never meant to return? I don't know Don't you? I'll tell you. To keep out my pestering relatives And inside, to guard his wife His wife, me, Butterfly You never hear of a foreign husband coming back to his nest Silence, or I'll kill you That last morning, I asked him if he would return His heart was heavy, but he smiled to conceal his sadness "Butterfly, my little wife, I'll be back when the roses bloom" "In the season when the robins nest again" - He'll be back - Let's hope Say it with me: he'll be back He'll be back Why are you crying? You lack faith. Listen One fine day we'll see a thread of smoke rising... ...out on the horizon, and then the ship will appear The white ship will sail into port It will fire its cannon. Can you see? He's back I don't go down to meet him I stand on the brow of the hill, and wait And the long wait means nothing Out of the bustling town... ...comes a man, a tiny dot, heading for the hill Who can it be? And when he arrives, what will he say? He'll call "Butterfly!" from afar I'll say nothing, but stay hidden Partly to tease, and partly... ...so as not to die when we first meet again. He'll be a little overcome, and call, "Little wife, verbena blossom!" The names he used to call to me when he was here This will all come true, I promise you Keep your fear to yourself. With a faith that can't be shaken... ...I'm waiting for him She's there. Go in Excuse me - Madam Butterfly - Madam Pinkerton, please - My dear Mr Consul - Do you recognise me? Welcome to an American home Thank you Are your ancestors well? I hope so - Do you smoke? - No, thank you - I have here... - I see the sky is blue today Thank you. I have... Do you prefer American cigarettes? - I have to show you... - Here I've had a letter from Benjamin Franklin Pinkerton - Really? Is he well? - Perfectly I am the happiest woman in Japan - May I ask you a question? - Please do In America, when do the robins make their nests? - I beg your pardon? - Earlier or later than here? But why? My husband promised to return in that happy season... ...when the robins nest again Here they've nested three times, but there they might not nest so often Who's laughing? Oh, that nasty man - I'm enjoying... - Silence He dared to... No, first answer my question I'm very sorry, I don't know. I haven't studied ornithology - Orni... - ...thology - So you don't know - No. We were saying... Yes, as soon as Pinkerton set sail... ...Goro besieged me with proposals... ...for one new husband or another Now he's promising a fortune for an idiot A rich man, Yamadori. She's destitute. Her relatives have all cut her off Look, here he comes Yamadori, still not discouraged by the pains of love? Will you still slit your wrists if I don't kiss you? Unrequited love is one of the greatest trials in life You've had so many wives you must be used to it Divorce has set me free from every one You're too kind I swear I'd be true to you Villas, servants, gold. A princely palace at Omura - I'm not free to wed - She thinks she's still married I don't think so, I am - But the law... - I don't know about that It states that abandonment is the same as divorce Japanese law Not the law of my country - Which one? - The United States The poor woman Of course, throwing out your wife... ...is what they call divorce here But in America you can't do that - Can you? - No, but... There, a stern judge says to the husband... "So you want to leave. Do tell us why" "I'm fed up being married" Then the judge says, "Scoundrel, off to gaol" Tea, Suzuki Did you hear that? Her utter blindness is so distressing Pinkerton's ship has been sighted If she sees him again... He won't show his face. I came expressly to tell her Your Honour... What tiresome people I leave you my heart, heavy with sorrow. But I still hope As you wish - If you would only... - Unfortunately, I won't Come and sit here. Shall we read this letter? Let me press it to my lips and to my heart You're the kindest man in the world. Begin "Will you have a look for that beautiful girl..." - Does it really say that? - Yes, but if you keep on... I won't say another word "Three years have gone by since those happy days" He's been counting too "Butterfly might not now remember me" Not remember him? Suzuki, tell him "Not now remember me..." Patience! "If she still loves me and is waiting for me..." Such sweet words! Blessed letter "...I'd like you please to discreetly prepare her..." - He's coming back! When? - "...for the blow..." - When? - For goodness' sake! I have to stop this now. Damn that Pinkerton! What would you do, Madam Butterfly... ...if he were never to come back again? There are two things I could do Go back to entertaining people with my songs Or else, better, die It pains me to shatter your illusions Accept that rich man Yamadori's proposal Can you really be saying this to me? God almighty, what can I do? Quick, Suzuki, His Honour is leaving - Are you sending me away? - Please, no more I was brutal, it's true You cause me such pain It's nothing I thought I would die But it passes as quickly as the clouds across the sea Has he forgotten me? And this? Will he be able to forget this too? Is it his? Who ever saw a blue-eyed Japanese child? These lips, these golden curls? Of course. Does Pinkerton know? No He was born when he was in that vast land of his But you'll write to say a son without equal is waiting for him Tell me if he doesn't then rush across land and sea Do you know what that man had the heart to think? That your mother will have to take you in her arms... ...and wander the streets in the wind and rain... ...to earn the money to feed and clothe you And stretch out her hand to the pitying people... ...crying, "Hear my sorrowful song!" "Take pity on an unhappy mother" Then Butterfly's ghastly fate will be to dance for you And as she used to do, the geisha will sing And the joyful song will end with a sob No, not that A profession of dishonour Dead! Never dance again I'd rather end my life Death! How sad I'm going back down. Will you excuse me? Give him your hand Lovely golden hair. What do they call you? Say, today my name is Sorrow But write to my Daddy and tell him the day he returns... ...my name will be Joy Your father will hear, you have my word Wasp! Cursed toad! - What happened? - That vampire! He's always spreading the tale... ...that no one knows who the father is I only said that in America... ...when a child like that is born... ...he will always be an outcast You're lying! Say that again and I'll kill you You'll see, my little love, my pain and my comfort You'll see, my little love He'll come and take us far away to his country The harbour cannon! A battleship White... The stars and stripes... It's going to drop anchor Steady my hand so I can make out the name The name... There it is: Abraham Lincoln They were all lying I was the only one who knew Only I, who love him See how foolish it was to doubt? He's here Just when they were all saying, "Weep and despair" My love has triumphed My love and my faith have triumphed He's coming back and he loves me Shake the cherry-tree and cover me with flowers Let me cool my burning brow in its fragrant shower Calm yourself, you're crying No, I'm laughing. How long will we have to wait? - What do you think, an hour? - Longer Two hours, perhaps Cover everything with flowers like a sky filled with stars Fetch the flowers - All the flowers? - All of them Peach blossom, violet, jasmine Every flower from every tree The garden will look like winter I want all the fragrance of spring The garden will look like winter - Take these - Pick more You often came to this hedge to look... ...far out to sea, with tears in your eyes The sea has returned him. I want nothing more I gave my tears to the soil it gives me back flowers The garden is bare Come and help me - Roses across the threshold - I want all the fragrance of spring Let us scatter April flowers all around I want all the fragrance of spring - Lilies, violets? - Scatter them all around Let us scatter April flowers all around Let us scatter morning glory, lilies and violets all around Let's scatter handfuls of violets and roses Verbena flowers, petals from every flower Now come and make me beautiful No, first bring me the child My looks have faded Too many sighs passed my lips My eyes stared too hard into the distance Put a touch of rouge on my cheeks You too, little one... ...so the wait doesn't make you pale Don't move while I arrange your hair What will they say! And the Bonze... ...already pleased to see me hurt And Yamadori pining away! All of them ridiculed and humiliated It's done Bring the sash I wore as a bride I want him to see me dressed the way I was that first day And a red poppy in my hair Like this We'll make three little spy-holes in the shoji And we'll wait as quiet as mice It's daybreak Cio-Cio-San He'll come, you'll see Go and rest I'll call you when he comes Sleep, my love. Sleep pressed to my heart You are with God and I am with my grief Golden starbeams for you. Sleep, my child Poor Butterfly Who's there? Hush! Don't waken her She was so tired She stayed up all night waiting for you with the child How did she know? For three years she's checked every ship Its colour and its flag Didn't I tell you? - I'll call her - No, not yet Last night she wanted to scatter flowers Didn't I tell you? How sad Who's outside in the garden? A woman - Hush! - Who is it? Best tell her everything - Who is she? - She's with me - Who is she? - She's his wife Blessed souls of our ancestors! The sun has been blotted out for the little one We chose to come early to see you alone, Suzuki To see if you can help in her moment of trial What good would that do? I know that nothing can ever console her But we have to think of the child's future - The bitter scent... - That lady... - ...of these flowers - ...who doesn't dare enter... - ...is like poison to my heart - ...will care for him like a mother - You want me to ask a mother...? - This room hasn't changed - Talk to her... - But now there's a chill of death ...bring her here It might even be better if Butterfly sees her Then she'll grasp the truth Three years have gone by, and she's counted the days and hours - Come along, Suzuki - I can't stay here I'll wait for you on the path Didn't I tell you? You help her. I'm overwhelmed by remorse Remember, I told you when she gave you her hand "Be careful, she believes in this." And my words have proved right Deaf to advice, deaf to doubt, vilified... ...she put her whole heart into waiting for you I've suddenly realised the harm I've done I feel this anguish will never leave me On your way. She'll learn the sad truth alone Goodbye, flowery refuge of happiness and love The sight of her gentle face will torture me for the rest of my life I'm sure she's already guessed I can't bear to see you look so desolate Like a coward, I'm running away I can't bear to see you look so desolate I'm a coward Will you tell her? I promise Will you advise her to entrust...? - I promise - I'll bring him up like my own son I believe you. But I need to be alone with her At this terrible time, alone Her tears will never end Suzuki! Where are you? I'm here. I was praying and tidying up No, don't come in He's here! Where is he hiding? There's the Consul But where...? He's not here That woman... What does she want from me? Everyone's silent Why are you crying? No, don't tell me anything I might suddenly fall down dead Suzuki, you're so kind, don't cry Just quietly say yes or no - Is he alive? - Yes But he's not coming back. They've told you You wasp! Answer me - Never again - But he arrived yesterday? Yes That woman is making me so frightened She's the innocent cause of all your misfortune Forgive her She's his wife That's the end of everything for me Be brave! They want to take all I have My son Make the sacrifice for his sake What a sad mother... ...abandoning my son Very well, I have to obey him Can you forgive me, Butterfly? Beneath the arc of heaven there's no woman happier than you Never be sad on my account - The poor little thing - It's a terrible shame Will she give up her son? I'll give him up if he comes to collect him Come up the hill in half an hour Your heart is beating like the wings of a trapped moth There's too much light from outside and too much spring Close up Where's the child? Playing. Shall I call him? Let him play. Go and keep him company - I'll stay with you - Go, I order you "He who can no longer live with honour dies with honour" You? My little god, my love, the flower of lily and rose Never know that it's for you... ...that Butterfly is dying So that you can cross the seas... ...and grow up without the pain... ...of knowing your mother abandoned you You came down to me from the throne of paradise Look closely at your mother's face Let some trace of it remain with you Look well. Goodbye, my little love Go and play Butterfly!
