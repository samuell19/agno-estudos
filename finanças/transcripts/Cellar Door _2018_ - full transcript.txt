What's the last thing you remember? What the fuck, ma? You're later and later every day. We're not having the same conversation over and over. Can you smell those paints? No, I smell ash. Alright, come on then. Help me fix this. But look how well it works for my painting. It's not for painting, ma, is it? Where do you want this? Come on, you're not meant to be off your feet. I'm not dead yet. Yeah well, the day is young. Well don't hold your breath. I'm not going anywhere. No just yet. What? What's wrong with wanting to bring a grandchild into this house? You mean into this ashtray? What's wrong with wanting to chase little ones before I'm ash myself? Mom, you can't even climb the stairs. Well anyone who looks this much like a granny should be a granny. Right, you ready? (children's laughter) Doesn't it look familiar? You always said you would bring me there one day. (children laughing) Alright, alright, you've had your laugh, enough. Fingers up now, everyone. Everyone. Fingers up everyone. Explanation, please? You fucking little maggot. It's me, you alright? Ok, let's go. You're an embarrassment. Right, ok. Take me home. You coming? You gonna come with me? We'll be together, ok? Let's go. You are so bold. Ah, come on. Stop, stop, no you can't stand up there. No, come on. No, get down. Get down. Come on. Sorry God. No I don't want to go. You wanna stay? I wanna stay. Do you wanna go up there? Yeah. With me? Make me feel ok about this. You and me, we're gonna get married. Right here. When? I don't know, does it matter? I mean, you already are the rest of my life. We're growing old together. Oh my. Are you alright, dear? Yeah, I'm fine, I'm sorry. Are you decent? Yeah. Sorry, I thought we were alone. We? Have you lost your way? I should go. Can I go? What is your name? Aideen. Have you lost your way, Aideen? This was a mistake. I don't believe there are mistakes. Trust me sister, there are. I take it that wasn't your husband? Poor girl. I'm going. I really am sorry. Being left all alone, in your state. Poor girl. And what state is that? What's happening? What's happening? Calm down, it's alright. It's alright, you're ok. (woman screaming) We won't make it. Stop right here. Focus on my eyes. That's it, that's it. What's going on? Please, please. Focus. Ok. Don't look down there, we've got you. That's it dearie, that's it dearie. You're ok. Ok, steady now. Focus on my eyes, follow my breath. Don't look down there, look at me. That's it, that's it. (woman screaming) I can feel it. Where's the baby? Where's the baby? Remember you can come see me whenever you need to. No - I I'm available for you, ok? Where's my baby? Wait, is something wrong? Did something happen? Aideen. Is he ok? I don't understand. We've been through this. I was pregnant. You need to give yourself time. We can give you something to help you relax. It'll all be clear in the morning. No, I - I need to find Karl. My mother's gonna be waiting on me. They know where you are. You'll see them soon. No, I'll see them at home. Aideen, dear, please stop. You've been through a lot. Lord knows we went through much of it together. We both need time to recover. Stay a little while, for me. I promise that if you do things will be clearer tomorrow. You need to let us help you. Please Aideen. Aideen is still adjusting. Let's make her feel at home. Is that a sunset? Is that what you see? Great question. What do you see? Like is it half full or half empty? What do you see? I'm sorry. I can see it is completely empty. Let's carry on, dearies. Are you gonna wear it? No, I was going to make it smaller. That's nice. Like a baby-sized one. That's really nice. I've never seen him before. He must be here for you. I'm Florence. Call me Flo. You are Aideen. Aidie. I don't think I'll shake your hand, cause it was down your pants an all. I know what you're gonna do next. Fuck this. (DOOR SLAMS) Hiya. I knew you'd be here at this precise moment. What's the way out? How do I get out of this place? You don't. You don't or can't? This is a rest-of-your-life kinda place. What is it? This is our home. This isn't a home. It's better if you're kind to them. You're never leaving, so you may as well be kind. Never leaving? You don't know me. I know what you're going to do. And not do. That's why I'm here. Why are you here? Why are you special? Why are you special? No, you are special. In God's eyes and mine. He's here for you. Don't be frightened. He's here for you. What's the last thing you remember? (MATCH STRIKING) Fuck sake, ma. You're later and later every day. We're not having the same conversation over and over. What day is it? You just lost all your credibility. What's gotten into you? I forget. Your father's not gonna like that. You could fill a sceptic tank with what he doesn't like. Can you smell those paints? No mom, I smell ash. Come on and help me fix this. (baby crying) Have you got any news? Don't hold your breath. What's wrong with wanting a grandchild before I'm gone? Nothing ma. Anyone who looks this much like a granny should be a granny. But for God's sake, do it in the right order. Aidie, it's happening again, isn't it? (children laughing) Fingers up everyone, now. No. (children gasping) It's me, you alright? Well, what do you think? Do you like it? It's gorgeous. It's gorgeous? Ok. So what do you think? It's gorgeous. Oh no, no, we're not meant to go up there. Come on. No, no, we're actually not meant to go up there. Ah fuck. Oh shit, sorry. Come on. What? Are you gonna leave me by myself? No, we're both gonna leave because we can't be here. Well I'm staying, you can go. What are you worried about? Him. Let's go. What are you doing? We're gonna be at the altar. Sorry God. You're gonna leave me. I'm not gonna leave you. I promise. Make me feel ok about this. Do you wanna know a secret? You and me, we're gonna get married. Yeah, and we're gonna get married right about here. When? I don't know, does it matter? You're the only person I'll ever love. Oh my. Are you alright, dear? I'm gonna get you help. Don't touch me. What's your name? What's your name, dear? You know my fucking name. Ok, we're gonna help you. Alright, you're safe now. No, I want an ambulance. I want a proper hospital. A hospital, no! It's quicker if we take you, ok? She can't stay here. What's happening to me? Focus on my eyes, follow my breath. Please get my mother. I can feel it. (baby crying) Where's the baby? Mom? No, you can call me mom if you'd like. Actually, no. Call me Flo. I'll call you whatever you like, just undo these straps. I told you to be kind. All you have to do is be kind. What's the date? August. August what? A Sunday in August. I'm - not so good with time. None of us are. You shouldn't try to leave again. They hate that more than anything. Well then they'll hate me. You won't tell them it was me that freed you, sure you won't? What is this place? It's for girls who need help. I don't need help. We all need help. So why are you here? What kind of help do you need? I told you. I can see the future. That's special. Thank you. It's not just me though, we're all special. That's why they're keeping us here. So this is a home for psychics? It's a home for girls who have problems with time. So what's my future? That older man is here to take you away. Don't let him near you. You can see the future, right? Clearly. If you could see the future you would have ducked. How do I go back? What was it? Use this notebook. Start writing everything down. Not the details, details are confusing, only the big things. And don't draw, write. Drawing doesn't work you're not a fucking camera. The details are confusing. Don't draw, Write. Are you listening to me? You need to go back and find your son before it's too late. Who are you? I'm you. Are you listening to me? Do you hear me? You need to go back and see your son before it's too late. What are you gonna do? Say it. I'm gonna use this notebook, I'm gonna start writing everything down and I'm not gonna fucking draw. Say it. I'm gonna use this notebook, I'm gonna start writing everything down and I'm not gonna fucking draw Say it! Who am I? Say it! I'm losing myself. No you're not. Here I am. Write, don't draw. How do I get out of here? Help me. How do I get out of here? Don't be frightened. Eve's symptoms are particularly unnerving but she is harmless. I want out. You all do. Where is my baby? There are no babies here. No, you took him, I saw you with him. And put him where? You've explored every inch of our home have you seen any babies? This isn't my home. At least apologize to Florence for attacking her. She is so very fond of you. I didn't attack her. Of course she should not have been in your room. There are consequences for being where you should not be. Consequences for wandering off. She didn't do anything wrong. I didn't mean to hurt her. I understand, dear. Have you done other things you didn't mean to? Have you seen things you should not see? Have you heard things? Felt things? Have you heard things? Been to places that do not exist? I'm not crazy. No, you are special. In God's eyes and mine. I wanna go home. Maybe after you apologize to Florence? And a meeting with the Father about why you are here will put your mind at ease. I'm not staying here. That's your choice. But remember there are good choices and bad choices. Kindness or consequence. It's funny how the past can sometimes be so far away and sometimes so close. And the future, well, no one can see the future. No one. I realize that now. Clearly. There's a place in our minds where we put things that don't make sense. Sometimes we put our whole entire selves there. It feels oh so good to be out of that place. Back to normal. With your help. And the Father Lord God. Thank you both so much. Of course, dearie. Tell me more about this place in your mind. Well, I can't really because I've closed the door to it. Which side are you on? Well, like I said I'm better now. What if you end up back in that place? Oh, no heart. I won't. What if you are on the wrong side of that door? That door is closed. I can see that now. Clearly. We don't go through doors we are not supposed to do we? Do we Florence? (baby crying) (door opening) Do you know what your name means? Fire. So far it's been fitting. You shouldn't smoke in your room. I don't smoke. Have you sinned, Aideen? No. You're quick to answer. I don't need to think about it. We've all sinned. Confession brings us peace and clarity. You would know that if you came to confession. I'll need to get sinning first. I'm sure it says somewhere that defiling a bible is sin. You're fine. Wait there - I'll get you something more suitable. You can draw what you like in there. You can keep it private. I'm here to help. When you are ready to let me help you. You will ask. If I need help why don't you get me a doctor? There are some things a doctor cannot fix. (PENCIL SCRATCHING ON PAPER) Don't draw on the walls, dearie. Where is my son? Have you lost your way? I know you're hiding him here somewhere. Where's my son? Which one of these is him? They've all got different faces. Are they all your children? Is that what you see? Is that what you see? What I see is a lost woman who is drawing on the walls instead of accepting the help that is in front of her. You mustn't draw on the walls. If you girls insist on acting like infants you will be treated like infants. You will be swaddled like infants until you relearn how to act your own age. At one time you've all had to do this for your own babies, even if they protested. Likewise, we will protect you lovely ladies, despite your protests. I wanna go home. To help you remember your dignity as beautiful women. I wanna go home to my mother. To help you remember your dignity as beautiful women. To help you remember your dignity. I wanna go home. I don't know if I'm alive or dead. We all will die one day. But every other day you don't. Do you know where my son is? You haven't seen him yet. Then why can I remember his face? Can you? His face is right there, but I can't see it. It's so close. I can't see it. You're later and later every day. We're not having the same conversation over and over. Can you smell those paints? Doesn't it look familiar? You always said you'd bring me there one day. And I know you will before I'm ash myself. I'm losing my mind. Me and you, we've had this day before. Over and over. So many times. Do you hear me? I'm losing my mind. It's not your fault. You've been locked away for so long, along with all the other unwed mothers who lost their dignity. Jesus, the fucking hypocrites. I had a son, right? Yes. He was young. Scared to death. Did you love that boy? Yeah. I did. Do you believe me? Please tell me you believe me. What a damn shame. You could've made me a grandmother. God knows I look like one. But I did have a son. You do have a son. He's in there with the nuns. You can get him. They'll have records on him. And that's one thing about the bloody nuns, they keep meticulous records. Find them. Find those records. Find your boy, he needs his mother. He's just a baby. Who's looking after him? He's not a baby anymore. He's five years old. You need to go and get him. Go. Before they sell him or bury him. Have you seen him? No. Have you seen him? He was in your class. (children laughing) Fingers up now. Fingers up! Look at me. Show me your face. Show me your face. Please let me see your face. Look at me. Look at me! (MUSIC PLAYING) Hey, it's me. It's me, Aidie. Karl. Karl. Aidie, take my hand. Come on. I know where to go. Don't let them near me. Don't leave me. I'm not gonna leave you. I promise. I promise, ok? Aideen? Is that you? Do you need my help? Is there something you need to confess? No. We all need to confess. I don't. All of us have sinned. I haven't. Confession brings us peace and clarity. I have not sinned. So why are you here? Father. What do you see? A set of oils for you. Bring these to Aideen's room. We've finally found a use for them. Will you be alright on your own? We'll be fine. Thank you. What do you see? I've got a test for you. It's only fair, I guess. What do I have to do? Put your thumbs together like this? You ready? What do you see? I don't know what I see. Do you want to know what I see? What do you see? I see a way to get my son back. Aideen, you can't be in there! I know my son is here somewhere. Tell me where to find him. Aideen, open the door. Aideen, open the door. Open the door, please. Open the door before somebody finds out. Aideen. Aideen! I know you're hiding him. Aideen. You can't handle her. He's here. Tell me where to find him or I swear to God I'm going to burn this place down. Aideen, what are you doing? Aideen! Aideen for God's sake! Aideen! Show me where to find them. Mark it. Mark the map. Hurry up! I did it. Aideen. Aideen for God's sake. Aideen. Aideen. Have you lost your way, dearie? Have you lost yourself, Aideen? Please just level the bed. You were told - if you behave like an infant, you will be swaddled like an infant. Please, I'm falling. You're forgetting that we are here to help. A little kindness back is all I ask. Kindness or consequence. What about my boy? There is no baby. Any thoughts otherwise, dearie, and we're going to have to swaddle those out of you too, aren't we? Is he dead? No. I was there. I saw. You were here. For let me see, at least eight weeks now. You've barely left this room in eight weeks. You'll see that it is true. In time. You always do. Don't leave me like this. Don't leave me like this. Don't leave me like this! I told you to be kind. You destroyed their work. She's gonna be really pissed when she sees this mess. I told you to write, not draw. There are two of you? You have to go back. They're really mad at you. Don't fucking draw. You have to find him, you have to go back. You made her bleed. We're not here to make friends. We're here to find him. Don't get comfortable. Go back. You never left in the first place, there is no going back. You never dug at those graves? Look at your hands. Look at your eyes. The truth is behind them. You have to find him now before they sell or bury him. That older man is here for you. You need to go back and see your son before it's too late. Find the cellar door. Say that - cellar door. Cellar door. Clasp your hands together like this. Say it. Cellar door. Cellar door, cellar door. Cellar door, cellar door, cellar door. Cellar door, cellar door, cellar door. (MATCH STRIKING) Did you find him? It's all fading, ma. Not all of it. Look at your hand. Sweetheart. It's me, momma. Come here. Don't be scared baby. Look at me. Look at me. Let me see your face. No. Come back. No, not this time. No, don't leave. You're the one that leaves. No, I'd never leave you. You're a fucking coward. But I'll forgive you. You're the only one I'm ever gonna love. We're growing old together. Let go of me. I'm doing this on my own. This is over. I need you to take this. It'll make you feel better, dearie. I feel fine. I'm sure you do, Aideen. But you still need to take the pill. This is over. I don't need to be here anymore. I don't need to be here anymore. I still have the baby inside me, see? Feel it. He kicked. Did you feel that? Now, Aideen, dear... I'll take it from here. Now, now, dear mother. Swallow it. Swallow it. Swallow it and it will be over. Don't. You swallow pills when we tell you to swallow the pills. Please. If you allow us to help you, you will forget this nonsense and delusion. The baby. The baby, the baby. God forgive me but I've lost my patience. He's here for you. Bly is with him. She's going to be really pissed when she sees this mess. You need to go. I don't know where. Find the cellar door. Where did you hear that? From you. Well, the other you. That's how it was written. Get out of here! Look at me. Look at me! Find the cellar door. (screaming) Do you know where my son is? You haven't seen him yet. How can I remember his face? Can you? His face is right there, and I can't see it. He's so close, I can't see it. He's so close I can't see it. You have to go back, do it again. How can I go back? You can shift time. It fucks you up but can shift back and forth through time. That's not possible. You know that it is. You have to go back. Get him out of there. I don't remember how. They're afraid of you because you're not afraid of them, because you can control it. Because you can control it. Control it. Go back. Clasp your hands together like this. Find the cellar door, say that. Cellar door. Cellar door. Cellar door. Cellar door. Find the cellar door, say that. Cellar door, cellar door, cellar door... Cellar door. Oh, sweetheart. I can't see you. Come - come to momma. Don't you wanna come to momma? Let me see your face. Please let me see your face. You left me momma. No. You're gonna leave me again. No, I would never leave you. You're gonna hide me down in the cellar. I need to see your face. Shhhh! Ma. What's the last thing you remember? What's the last thing you remember? What's the last thing you remember? I don't know if I'm alive or dead. We all will die one day, but every other day you don't. How do I go back? They're afraid of you because you're not afraid of them. If you can control it. Control it. Clasp your hands together like this. Find the cellar door, say that. Cellar door. Cellar door. Cellar door. Cellar door. Cellar door. Cellar door. Cellar door. Cellar door. Cellar door, cellar door, cellar door. Why do I keep going back? If I can control it, I can go forward into the future. I can go forward into the future. (KETTLE WHISTLING) Tea's ready. Daniel? That's right. It's me, Daniel. Well done, ma. You're not my Daniel. Ma, it's me. I'm your son. Here, let me show you. Remember this? Ah, now you remember. Oh my god. I've gone too far, I've missed everything! You haven't gone anywhere, ma. You've been here with me. No, you don't understand. I've gone too far into the future! Ma. Look at you, I've missed your whole life! You haven't missed anything. I need to go back, I've missed everything. It's the Alzheimer's ma, it has you confused. I need to go back. Ma, I'll - I'll put on some music. You like that. There. There, listen. You wanna dance? Just try to stay relaxed. Ma, please, ma. You don't need to say anything. No, no. You don't need to say a thing, ma. No, no, no... Here, I'll tell you what, why don't we paint? I'll help you paint, ma. Please. My life! Do you wanna sit down? You must sit down. Nurse, we need help, please. Ok, ok, let's take it nice and easy. Ok, ok, I got you. I got you. I'm just about to. Increase the dosage. They're only here to help you, ma. There we are, you're ok. Let's breath together, nice and easy, that's it. Just breath together. It's normal for this stage. Normal? It's torture. Ok, you're ok now. I'll take it from here. Let's get those pills into you, dearie. Please don't leave me like this. Help! Flo, Flo help... Ma. Flo! Oh my god. Flo, Flo! Who left you like this? It's alright ma, it's coming down. It's coming down. Nurse! Get in here, please. Please don't leave me like this. Nurse! Flo! It's me, it's Daniel, it's Daniel, it's Daniel. Ma, it's Daniel, you're alright. You're ok. No, please. I'm here, ma. Please don't leave me like this. I won't leave you, I never leave you. Don't leave me like this. You're fine, don't worry. No. Is everything ok? Ok, ok... Who left her like this? I was able to get her meds into her this way. She's distressed. It's a way to calm them down. Do you see the way she's holding the sheets? Are you fucking serious? Let's take a step back, please. She was screaming. She could hurt herself. So you put her like this when I'm not here? She always settles afterwards. You are never to leave her like that again, is that clear? We want all of our patients to be comfortable. We will make sure that your mother is given - You will make sure that she doesn't ever go near my mother again. I want someone else looking after her. I'll arrange that. Kindness or consequence. Bitch. You're a piece of work. These moments are getting fewer and farther apart. Is there anything else you want to know? Was I a good mother? You were the best. But I left you. Did I leave you? I was taken. You didn't stop fighting until you got me back. You were put in one of those homes for unwed mothers. You weren't exactly their favourite guest. Never did well with institutions. They did separate us, but you did come for me. When I was five. It was such a different time back then. We've never been apart from that day onward. We stayed in your mother's cellar for a few days. We hid there when they came looking for us. You remember the smell of those oil paints? (FOOTSTEPS) Shhh! Shhh! I've lost myself. No you haven't, ma. You're still here. Where? With me. Our memories. You have had a rich, full life. I'll never forget the way you held me. Pure joy. Was I a good mother? You were the best. Was I a good mother? What's the last thing you remember? MUSIC PLAYING MUSIC PLAYING
