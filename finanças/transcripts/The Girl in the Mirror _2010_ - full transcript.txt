What are we doing here? I've always wanted to come in here, And now you've done it, can we leave already? This place creeps me out. In a second. We're wasting time. Let's get the rest of the stuff and get out of here. Are you really scared? Like, really, for real? I heard a girl died in this house. No, a girl died in this house. I'll prove it to you. Look at this place. Can we just go already? In a minute. Not until I find it. Find what? This. How did you know this was here? I didn't... I wasn't sure. They say a girl killed herself I front of a mirror, if you stare into it long enough, you can see her. I bet this is it. That's stupid. We came all the way in here for this? I hate you. What are you doing? Take off your shirt. Why do we have to show our tits? It's for my website. I don't want to be on your website. Come on, don't look so depressed. Could you put your shirt back on, so we can get out of here? What are you doing? Hello? Can I help you? Shit, you startled me. You here to see the place? Yes, yes I am. You look just like... Never mind. Thought I was done for the day well, this is it. Not much to it. The only bad part is... Street parking. I don't have a license. How old are you? How old's the house? Cell reception is not that great in this house. You might want to use the landline. There's things that need to be repaired here and there, rent's a grand a month. I'll take it. Just you and no roommate? Nope. I like living alone. We're never really alone. - What's wrong with your arm? - Nothing. You a college student? Yes. And... listen, money isn't an issue, if you're concerned. I have a few grand saved, if it's all the same to you, I would really like to avoid living in the dorms. I don't like people. Boyfriend? Maybe. Tell you what. I'll let you start moving in your stuff, I'll run the background check, and if everything checks out, you're good to go. Okay, thank you. Alright... Key to the front, key to the back. And I do the gardening myself. You got any questions? Why is rent so cheap? There's a history to this house. It's not for the lighthearted. You'll be the first person that's lived here since... You know what, it's okay, I don't want to know. Rent's due the first of the month, three day grace period. Good morning. Yeah, good morning. Headed to class? Yep. Do you like roller skates? I know everybody has rollerblades now, but... I found these in the garage and I thought you might be able to get some use out of them Um... Yeah, sure. Good. I'll just lean them against the porch here. Okay... Thank you. I want you all to take out a sheet of paper. - Is this seat taken? - Get your fucking hands off me! My mistake. Perverted... Hey Sarah. What's her problem? Jitters? First day of class? I don't know, it can be intimidating. Who are you? Tell me your life story. Fill up the entire page and... Be creative. Begin. Gentleman in the first row, Yes. Read what you've got. Alright... Dirt roads, and aluminum lawn chairs, with polyester fabric, are the things that come to mind when I think about where I'm from. It's as far as I've got. Keep working on it. Miss in the black shirt, second row. Yes, you're next. Um... I didn't write anything. Nothing? - Nothing. - Why are you here? What do you mean? Why are you in this class? I... Want to be a writer. Well there's only one way. You have to tell me something right now. I don't know what to tell you... Start with your name! My name is Alix. Alix with an "i", not and "e", it's not short for Alexandra, it's just Alix. And why are you in this class, Alix? I'm not sure. Well, why did you sign up? I guess because in the description it said I would find my voice. And the only way you're going to find that... is by... Fill in the blank. - Writing. - Correctomondo. Alright guys, I'm going to pair you up and have you guys go outside and find out more about your partner, okay? Where are you from? Planet Earth. Next question. Is this how you're going to answer all of the questions? Let's just get this over with. What was the last book you read? Detour. You've read Detour? Yeah, so? It's a really dark book. You don't seem like someone that would read heavy material. Ho. Since you have so much insight, what do I look like I would read? I don't know, like... Spy novels. Okay. So we're judging a book by its cover now? Right, you look like you would read... Teen angst novels. And you look like someone whose mommy and daddy are paying for their tuition so that you can become a doctor or some sort of suit and tie guy. And this whole creative writing and artistic bullshit is a first semester phase. And you look like you want people to feel bad for you because you're a hard case. You don't know shit about me. You don't know shit about me. That's the purpose of the assignment. - Can we just get this over with? - I said that already. Okay, your turn. - Where are you from? - I don't know. - Be serious. - I'm serious. I don't know where I'm from. I could be from Mars for all I know. I was abandoned at a church when I was a baby. So... I don't know. - I'm sorry. - Sorry, What are you sorry for? You're just saying that because you're supposed to. Were you adopted? I stayed with two families for a short period of time, but they wanted me for a check or for the fuck, which is strange, because I'm not even that pretty, so... Well, sex isn't always about how pretty you are. - Thank you, Prince Charming. - No, wait, - that came out wrong, I'm sorry, - No I'm out. Shit. - Hello! - What are you doing here? Don't be anti-social, invite us in. I could be a complete bitch, and it probably wouldn't matter. Nope. Cool! Hey. There's really not a lot to it, it's just walls and a window. This place is awesome. It's very vintage, I like it. Okay, just because it's old, doesn't mean it's vintage. Is this your family? No. We should definitely throw a party here. I'm not really the party type. You know, Jasper, the only thing you want to do is get drunk and then piss in someone's bushes. Cause I'm an attraction and everybody loves it. Do you guys know each other? Yeah, we went to high school together, unfortunately. Well, um... Well... Let's go. Very cool. What's behind this door? I don't know, it's a basement I think but I haven't been down there yet. We should check it out. I don't have a key. Those doorknobs? We can pop that shit right off. I'm just saying, if we really wanted to go down there, we could. Okay, that door is locked for a reason, and I'm guessing it's a good one. Yeah, I just moved in, I don't want to... Well aren't you curious though, just a little bit? Well... I did hear some strange noises coming from downstairs the other night. - - Well I think it's imperative that we go down there. I mean for your safety. So what do you think about this place? Pretty wicked if you ask me. Thanks. Hey, would you fuck Alix? - No, I'm not falling for that. - No, come on! You can be honest with me. I mean she's totally your type. No, you're my type. Well I'd fuck her. No, I'm serious, I would. No, it's such a smart investment buying property near university. She's renting. Do you know how to fix that? I think I broke it. Yo, my mom would kill for this. Okay... Guys, this place is not looking safe, okay? Alix that's probably why he told you not to come down here. There is mildew, spores and probably asbestos. It's like a museum down here. More like a danger zone. Yo, I don't know what's in these jars, but it's definitely not Kosher. Alix, be careful, there's broken glass. I don't need your help. - Shit! - What? There's spiders, I hate spiders. They're everywhere in this house. You know, they have those little bomb things, you can get at the grocery store, I use them all the time, it kills them so easy. Yeah, but you have to leave your house for the whole day. You do? That explains a lot, Sarah. Wait, wait, wait. Do you have condoms? No. I'll pull out this time, I promise! - What the fuck! - You always do this! Well I don't carry condoms everywhere I go! Have you read the package? It says you keep them in your wallet! Wait, shh... Did you hear that? What? It sounded like roller skates. Again with the touching. Look, I didn't get a chance to explain, about earlier. It's okay, there's no need to explain. I'm a big girl, I've been insulted before. It wasn't an insult. Look, you're not ugly, you're far from it, I... I just got my words mixed up, I'm sorry. Okay. Whoa, cool! - Ooh. - That is pretty cool. I heard if you die in front of a mirror, it takes your soul. That's what they say about Bloody Mary. What are you guys doing? Exploring. Did you find anything Magellan? There's some cool shit down here. Alright, well they're a dollar a draught at the O.P. tonight, are you guys game? Yes, we're so going! I don't know... Come on, it'll be fun. I can't even drink, and the idea of watching all of you get trashed isn't really that appealing. Okay, well you're with me tonight, and they love me over at the O.P. - Okay. - Alright. Have you been messing with the door? - No. - Somebody has, the doorknob is broken. You know, You can't just come in here whenever you feel like it. There's rules. You need to notify me before you come in again. Adalyn, you shouldn't mess with things that don't belong to you. My name's Alix! That's what I said... I'm charging you for the doorknob, and the labor. Whatever. - Hey! - What the fuck! Sorry, I knocked, but the door was wide open. You don't just walk into someone's house, I mean, what the hell is wrong with people! I'm sorry... You're right. Why are you here? - Brought your assignment. - I didn't ask you to do that. I know. So... Why weren't you in class today? I didn't feel like going. Okay. Are you going to take this class seriously? Because if you're not, I'd really like to pair up with someone else. Well, pair up with someone else then. I don't really want to... Why? Because I want you to help me. I'm not a fucking tutor. When you're up in front of the class, everybody pays attention. When you show up, at least. You're the best creative writer we have in there. So I'm asking you... Will you help me? - Please? - Okay! Only... Under one condition. This thing is heavy as hell, must weigh a hundred pounds! I feel like I'm carrying a dead body. Fuck! I'm... Really sorry. It's okay. If I hadn't trespassed, none of this would've happened. Yeah, you know, I could've stabbed you. Would you have really done that? Maybe, yeah. Thanks. Here. - I got it, I got it. - Okay. - Sorry. - Thank you. I should probably get going. Yeah, I have a bunch of stuff to do today too, so. Well, I'll see you in class. Yeah, sure. I think it looks good here. Why is it so cold in here? What the fuck? Hey! What are you doing here? Well I thought the best way to get you to come to class is if I drove you myself. What do you say? Yeah, I guess. - Your hair... - Are you about to have another moment where you mix up your words? It's good. - Really? - Yeah. Um... Okay. Just give me a second, I have to finish getting ready. - Okay. I'll be in the car. - Okay. I'm the landlord. I own this place. I'm David. Boyfriend? No, I'm just a friend. Alix mentioned a... Boyfriend. I'm not the boyfriend. I... Just go to school with her at the university. Adalyn means the world to me. If anything happens to her... well let's just hope nothing happens. You ready? Yeah. Who's Adalyn? I don't know, he keeps calling me that. I guess I just remind him of someone he used to know. Taken. Who's there? Yo, quit fucking around, turn the light back on! Are you okay? You look pale. I don't feel so well, could you take me home please? Yeah, of course. Here. Where did you get this? I have a natural disaster kit in my car. And don't ask. I just think that if you're prepared, it won't ever happen. That's weird. I guess it's broken. - Your temperature's normal. - That can't be right. - Well look, maybe I should just take you to a doctor. - No! I don't want to go to the doctor. I'll be alright. Do you think you could stick around for a little while? Okay. I'm going to go to the kitchen, I'm going to make you something that should make you feel better. You have to drink it, it's salty as hell, but... should kill everything in your system. Sounds awesome. David? David! David? David! David! Who are you? Are you okay? My name is Alix. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine I think. I... I just had a bad dream. How do you feel? Awful. Why are you getting out of bed? Can you help me? - I have to go downstairs. - Why? Just help me! Okay, alright... You should really be taking it easy. What are you looking for? It's okay, everything's fine. We can go upstairs now. What is it? It's Adalyn. Looks like my uncle Leroy. It's my landlord. My uncle is a landlord too. In the projects. Alright class, that's it for today. Papers are due next Friday, I expect you all to have one here, thank you. Alix, can I speak to you for a second? Yeah. Hey... Is everything okay? I know I missed a few assignments... And a couple of classes. I'm sorry. Look, the judge called me. She's checking up on you because she likes you and she wants you to do well. - And I know you don't want to go back to... - No, I don't. - Definitely not. - And I definitely don't want to fail you. You need this class, you have talent! You know, part of finding your own voice is finding out who you are and what you believe in. Okay. Look, I went to college too. Alright? I know it's a bit of a change. But... I know what you're going through. You don't know what I'm going through. You're not the first hard case to go through this system. Excuse me. You know what, Alix, I have to take this, I'll see you next class? Yeah? You're fucking up, Alix. Get it together. Get off me! You've got to be kidding me. Fucking wonderful. Well that's it. I'm sleeping over. I'm serious, David! You know, they say that sleepwalking is pretty common between siblings close in age. And twins. Who said that? Doctors. At least that's what the ones online say. I'm scared. Okay, first thought on your mind. This person has self-esteem problems. They think everyone sees them as ugly, trashy and troubled. But they really don't. What about the inside? - It's empty. - -Thank you, captain obvious, wonderful. I think that speaks for itself. Or, if we look at it metaphorically, it's empty because the person is empty, like, on the inside. They haven't had... Any real friends, or family, or anything. Interesting. Whose box do you think it is, Sarah? Alix. What gave it away? The photo of you, on the side. That's not me. That is you! Well, the similarities are very close. If that's not you, then I'm not hilarious. You are not hilarious. Alright guys, let's have a little break, be back in 15. I need to bum a smoke off somebody. Alright. Do you really think this looks like me? It's pretty close. I found this picture in the basement of my house in a locker box. I don't have any pictures of myself from childhood. What are we looking for? - Photographs, family type photos. - -Found a radio. You know, Al, I changed my mind. I don't think that photo looks like you Okay, I think I just touched mold. You guys can stop if you want, but I'm going to keep looking. My god. You totally have to look at this picture, it actually... Does look just like you. You know, I bet she lived here. I don't know... You guys, this is really starting to freak me out. - Let's check the internet. - No. Never mind. I don't want to know. Just put it back, put everything back, I should have listened and never come down here. Alix! Shit. What's the matter? I've seen that girl before. What? When? The brush in the basement? The girl in the bathtub, I mean she's in my head, David! You're not making any sense. I know I'm not making any sense, that's why I'm flipping out right now because nothing makes sense. She's dead. How do you know that? Because I just do. Okay, well, - What are you doing? - Finding out. No! David! - Stop, I don't care! - It'll take a second! I don't want to know! Alright Alix, what the fuck, why are you being so hostile? I'm over it, okay? So one minute you want to know, the next minute you don't? Why do you care so much? - I'm trying to help you! - Help me? Anyone who's ever helped me has either wanted money or a fuck. I guess you've never had anyone actually care about you. Care about me? You don't know shit about me! I'm the only one who seems interested! You're not interested. You're a shitty writer using me to get ahead in your class. You're not different from anybody else. Yes! I didn't know you smoked. I used to, then I quit. I had to walk several blocks to get a signal to call you, and I found myself standing in front of this convenience store, where there was a payphone. And I... Got these. You found a payphone around here? That's a fossil. - You want to see it? I have a picture. -Yeah, sure. Cool. What's up? I... Fuck! This is fucked up, in the worst possible way. How did this get in here? I'm afraid I might have done it, you know. I've been sleep walking, and I wake up in really strange places, covered in dirt. You aren't the type of person to kill somebody. Trust me. I'll know. This thing is starting to stink. Yeah, we have to get it out of here. I hope it doesn't have flies. Who the fuck dug that? Thank you... I don't play no fucking guitar. Boring. Damn, I'm horny. So long... I'm sorry. Man, I wish I was white. White people got it made, man. They don't got to do shit... Ooh, Lucille, Lucille! That's right, motherfuckers. Your LA privileges have been revoked. Hey, motherfuckers! Your LA privileges have been revoked! I said your LA privilege has been revoked, fool! Hold on. Bad boys. And you will know, I am the lord, when I lay my vengeance upon thee! Get it together, Alix. Come on! Get it together! What are you reading? Nothing. Why are you here so early? I have... Revisions. Hey look, can I ask you a question? It's for a story. Yeah, go for it. What would you do, if... You found out an awful secret about someone you care about. But no matter what you tell them, it's going to end up... Bad. Is this about Alix? It's for a story. Ooh! You like her, don't you? I think that's obvious. Well, I guess, you know, hope for the best? Alix. Since you're late, you're first. Heads. Come on down. Alix, are you okay? I'm going to take you to the nurses station. No, I'm... I'm fine. I just need some air. I think I'm losing my mind. Maybe you should see a doctor? I can't deal with doctors. You know, I'm sorry for what I said to you the other day. It was really mean. If I told you... That I did a background check on you on the internet, how mad would you be? Pretty fucking pissed. Well, I did a background check on you on the internet. Why would you do that? Because I'm trying to help you. Maybe there's some shit about me I didn't want you to know! Like the time your boyfriend stabbed you in the stomach? Yeah. Yeah, like the time my boyfriend stabbed me in the stomach. It's a perfect example. In fact, I think I'm starting to have some of the same emotions resurface. But go ahead, I'm curious, what else have you found out about me, since you're all up in my shit. I think I know who your mother is. No, Alix, wait! Don't touch me! You don't know who my mother is, and you don't know who I am, you're a fucking idiot. Hey, thanks for coming over. Aww, it's totally not a problem, okay? So who else is coming? Jasper and Tamara are on their way, Derek and Rachel are in the bathroom, smoking a bowl. And they think I don't know. Is David coming? What did he do? I don't want to talk about it. Alix, I saw him earlier today in class, I know he did something. Look who's here. Don't you knock? The door was open. What's in the bag? Stuff. What kind of stuff? - The good stuff. - Ooh Cheers? Cheers. You're ridiculous. Thank you. I just want it to be a party tonight, you know? Who was that? Nobody. Weird. Is David coming? I don't think David's coming. What did I say? I brought vodka and salsa! Did you just knock on the door? No, the front door was wide open. I have a drink for you. Thank you. That is fucking weird. Because at my parents' house, if you kept my bedroom door closed and the spare bedroom door closed, it would move back and forth because of a draught. It scared the shit out of me until the ninth grade. I thought it was Bloody Mary. Okay, I so need a Bloody Mary right now. Bloody Mary is one of my next stories about vampires. What? What are you doing here? I was hoping we could talk. Five minutes and I'm gone. Fine. Say what you need to say. You're right. I'm sorry. I went behind your back and invaded your privacy. I had nothing but good intentions. I know I'm not your favorite person right now, but there's some important things in here. You really should take a look at it when you get a chance. Like what? I think you should read it yourself. No! I want you to stand there and tell me something I don't already know. Why are you doing this? - Is this my punishment? - Is there any other way to put it? There are some articles in there about you. And that God-awful church you went to. And um... Your run-ins with the police, look, you should really read it yourself. Go on. You went to Holy Trinity High School for girls, you ran away twice in the same year... Tell me something I don't already know. You know what? If you don't want to read it, that's fine. But I'm not going to stand here and recite your life, like some narrator of some book. Fuck it. Yo, David, where are you going? What the hell is going on between those two? I don't know. He's been acting funny ever since that blindfold exercise today. That was so stupid. Yeah, you mean the one where Alix almost died? It helps strengthen your perceptions, which is key, if you want to be a writer. Ooh! I love this song! It's because you get all moist over the lead singer. Like a brownie. You! Alix, what are you doing all alone? Why don't you come out to the living room and make a fool of yourself with us? Everything okay? Excuse me. Alix! Look, I'm sorry I dug into your past. But I only did it because I care about you, and if you don't understand that, then we shouldn't see each other, but... I don't want that. I can't. You can't what? Look, you've read it yourself. I'm this fucked up person. A monster. I've done some really horrible stuff to myself and other people. Why would you want to be involved with me? What if there's an evil inside me just waiting to snap? Look, okay, so you're a bad girl, so what? You don't scare me. I have these really horrible thoughts. And I know you're a good person. I'm completely capable of hurting you. I'm willing to take my chances. Then you're stupid. When are you going to stop being afraid? What am I afraid of? Everything. You're afraid of me. - You're afraid of your past. - I'm not afraid of you. Really? Then why do you keep moving away from me? Because I'm cold. You're cold? I'm cold. I'm cold too. I have some extra blankets... Again. Bite me... You have goosebumps. You are cold. What's going on, I thought we were drinking? You remember that exercise Clay made us do on second day of class? The one with the newspapers. The one where we have three random articles, and we have to use them as the A, B and C story? Do that with these and tell me what you come up with. Okay... "Troops return home after Gulf War" "Wifey mysteriously disappears", Okay, and your C story? "Veteran attempts suicide, after the death of his daughter" That's fucking crazy, right? What does this have to do with Alix? Wait, wait. I... I don't have a... In my bag, at the end of the bed. Do you know your webcam is on? I completely forgot! Are you getting X-rated on me? Just turn it off and come back over here. What if I don't want to turn it off? Is this what you want to see? Shh. Wait, wait. Hold on. This is strange. Have you seen this before? No. Why is your landlord in your bedroom? He's a nut job. He's always leaving me these strange gifts. Who's the girl in the mirror? Where are you going? What's going on Alix? Where is it? - Where's what? - The one about the girl. - What girl? - Stop playing with me, I know it was here. It's bad Al, you don't want to see it. He's right, it's really better if you didn't see it. I want it, right now. What is it? You don't want to know. It's okay, just tell them. A 16 year old girl hung herself in the basement. - This basement? - Mhm. - Yeah. - My God... Okay, I am out of here. I've had a bad vibe since day one. Tamara, you get bad vibes from the ladies room. - Screw you, Jasper! - Tamara, Alix is our friend, we have to support her. I can support her from my dorm room. Excuse me. Great, the party's over. Where are you? Where are you, you stupid bitch! Leave me alone! Do you hear me, God dammit! Leave me alone! Stop torturing me! What are you doing, Alix! Alix! Your nose is bleeding. I'm bleeding? Shit. What's happening to me? I don't know. Alix, look at me. Alix? Alix! Alix, look at me! Alix! Stop! I'm your friend... No... Alix! Alix, stop, it's your friend, Jasper! Stop! Sorry. I'm so sorry... I am leaving, because this place has been creeping me out since day one. And if you guys want to stay, it is on you. Okay, I'm getting my stuff from Alix's room, and I am so gone. Tamara, wait up. Alix, please. This will only hurt for a second. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty... I didn't do this... I couldn't have done this... Wake up... Wake up, this isn't happening, this is a dream! David! Alix, why? I'm so sorry, this wasn't me. I'm going to get you help, okay? You're going to be okay, I'm going to get you help. David no! No, please stay with me, okay? I need you to stay with me! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry! I'm sorry... I'm sorry... No, you don't! - We're almost there, come on! - No! Stop it! Help me! They got it all wrong. I never meant to hurt anyone, but your mother was a whore. My mother? When I first saw you, I wasn't sure it was you. - Until now. - What are you talking about? Adalyn must've brought you to me. My... My mother, what... What happened to my mother? She left us. Said we didn't need her anymore. She left me, to have you. She left a sick little child. My actions were justified. Necessary, but your mother couldn't handle it. I hate you. Your mother said Adalyn got it from my side of the family. Adalyn got worse. If I could have only made those voices go away, she would have been normal, like everyone else. You're crazy. I defend the country, and come home to this! - This is my reward? - You're a coward! You're a fucking coward! Get off me, get off me! Be still, we have miles to go before we sleep. No! Look at me! Look at me! I wanted you to be my new daughter. Bit of irony for all the shit your mother put me through! Let me go! I don't know if you know, but this was your mother's mirror. Your mother didn't fight so much! Adalyn? Please. Morning Al, want some coffee? - You're all here! - Yeah. I mean, you guys stayed! Yeah, we just went to the store to get stuff for breakfast. Yeah, bacon was on sale, so Jasper bought five packs! Bacon is so good! Where's David? I think he was here a little bit ago. - Hey! - Hey. I've been looking all over for you, where have you been? I couldn't really sleep, so I decided to go... Exploring, as Jasper put it. Some pretty cool stuff down here. Well I'm glad you didn't leave, I thought maybe you'd left. Why would I do that? I've been pretty awful to you ever since I met you. It hasn't been easy, that's for sure. I'm not really good at the whole letting people in thing. I'm not going to hurt you. I know... It doesn't make sense, and it's... Pretty fucked up, but... What happened here wasn't your fault. I know, that's why I want to stay here. I want to try to put all the pieces together. I think it's really important to know where you've come from. That's something you've helped me realize. Hey, what is this doing down here? - Did this belong to... - My sister. Yeah. I think I'm going to keep it, though. Well, we should get going. Jasper's going to eat all the bacon. What? Remember when I first met you. You told me to keep my fucking hands off of you. Just shut up and kiss me. What's this? Something I should've given you the first day of class. It's everything you need to know about me.
