Mei! Mei! Mei! Where were you last night? I was at Ah Seng’s place. The foreign workers ran away again? I guess. You got your passport? I got it. Are you ok? I don’t feel so good. You have a fever. You want me to get you some medicine? No. Did Ah Piu call yet? No. Ping, I’m leaving. Remember to lock the door. Did they send the seafood over yet? No. Make sure you go get it later. It’s early. That’s not good. I haven’t taken my bag. You haven’t rested enough have you? I’ve had a fever these few days. Did you take any medication? Does it hurt here? Here? Are you sure you didn’t take any medication? How are you feeling? The baby didn’t make it. What happened? It was stillborn. Since the baby didn’t make it, Your aunt said to take this Rm500, as a gift. Where were you the last few nights? I went back to Ah Seng’s hometown. What happened? The baby died. What are you going to do? How much are you short? About RM2000. Where’s Piu? The documents are ok. Can she pay you the balance later? She already has everything else. That’s not what we discussed. The money comes with the documents. I need to hire a runner. There’s also fees from the Japan side. I can’t work like this. She’ll pay you once she starts working there. Tell you what, why don’t you come back when you have the money. Why don’t you ask your Aunt to lend you the money? She doesn’t know I’m going to Japan. Did you really not take any medication that day? You must’ve taken something. I took some stomach ache pills. Put it here. How many times do I have to tell you? Don’t block the freezer. Is it the pink stud’s? Yes. See you next week. Your aunt said not to open the door if you come home so late. Where did you go? I couldn’t find you. I fell asleep. Why are you calling so late, I’m sleeping. I’m itchy. Lower. Piu, can I talk to you? What’s up. I really want to go this year. I don’t want to stay here anymore. I’ll pay you once I get there. Ping, I’m already doing you a favor. We normally hire boys for this sort of work. You girls go there, after a while you end up working in a club or bar. What do you think happens to me then? You come find me when you have the money. Please. I have to go. Get up. Get up. Is Mei with you? Ah Piu wouldn’t help me. Do you have collateral? No. I can’t help you without any collateral. She’s Madame Tien’s niece. This isn’t Tien’s business. I can’t help you without any collateral. You’re Lau Ping Ping? You’ve no collateral? No. Isn’t there any other way? You go up to the room. So how? Let’s go home. Maybe your aunt took your passport because she didn’t want you to leave. One IDD card. I want to speak to Mei. Hello? How’s the work over there? Are the people nice? I gave you RM90. How come there’s so little? Did you hear what I said? I gave you RM90. Where’s the rest of the pork? It’s what the uncle gave me. You’re cheating me. What are you doing with the money? Buying clothes? Hand phone? I didn’t take your money. How come there’s so little pork? Do you think I’m stupid? Hey! What are you doing? Don’t bother coming to work anymore. Don’t’ tell my aunt. I’ll return the money. Auntie, I want to try again. So soon? Are you sure? How’s your stomach? I’m fine. What about the scar? Anything else? Two more packs of Bak Chen Twenty. Drink a bowl every night. Where’s the kwan yin I gave you? Where’s my passport? Later. Who do we have today? Kang! Where’s the Ah Wah? He’s downstairs.

What’s wrong with Ah Wah? He wasn’t there the last time. There’s something wrong with Kang. It’s best if you don’t miss this cycle. Come tomorrow again. Do you want people to think I’m your wife? I already have a wife. But do you want people to think that? She’s pretty and strong. The child will be pretty and strong. You give me a call. Ok. If it’s a boy you get RM4000, a girl, RM2500. What if something happens? Let’s not talk about those things. Where are you going? To see a friend. Do you like it here? No. When my family gets the UN card, we will go to Australia. I have a baby. Your aunt is not a good person. Your baby didn’t die. Your aunt gives the babies to a surrogate mother to nurse. How do you know? I know her. She’s a Burmese too. Auntie. Auntie! Is my baby still alive? Who told you? Did you sell it? Give me back my money! I want to speak to Mei. Mei? Tell auntie who told you? Tell me. I don’t care about the money. Auntie can help you. Just tell me who told you. Do you want to go have something to eat? I have to work today. Come to my house the day after tomorrow. I want to speak to Mei. How come she’s no longer working there? Do you know where she is? I know you want to go to Japan. I know you need money. Do you care about the baby or the money you lost? The money right? You don’t need to protect these foreigners. You remember the guy from last time, Song Li? He ran away with his girlfriend after I paid him. Hello auntie, how are you? Good. How’s business? Good. So? I’ll give you RM 2.2k a person.

We need to know where his friends live. Do you know where? Come with me. You know Kang? You guys live together? He’s been arrested. So how? What do you want? You get 2.5k, we’ll settle it. Go away.
