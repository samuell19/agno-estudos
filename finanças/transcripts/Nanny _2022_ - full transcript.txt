Aunty, do you need anything? No, no. - Just your share for the month. - Yeah, soon I'll have it. How is it? I start tomorrow, uh... Um, uh, the mother Amy, she's nice. I pray for you, eh? Just work hard to keep it. Jobs like this, they don't fall from the sky. Yes. Have a good night. Bonsoir, chérie. Aisha. Mm-hmm. New nanny for the Havs, right? Yes. First elevator on the right. - Aisha. - Hello, Amy. - Welcome. - Thank you. - How was the commute? - Yes, good. - Not too bad. It was okay. - Yeah? Great. Thank you. How are you? I'm... I'm well. But I think Rose is a little better. She's very excited. Oh, I am, too. I'm very excited. Well, um, these are for you. Oh. Okay. And I guess, now that it's official, I'll give you the full tour? - Yes. - Excellent. Okay. Follow me. First up is Adam's office. We civilians aren't allowed. Oh. And this... is yours. I mean, it's nothing fancy. Uh, for overnights. And please, uh, make this space yours. Bring whatever you need to feel at home: pictures, books, favorite pillow. Just one small request. Uh, no candles or incense. Rose is hypersensitive to certain smells. Okay. Rose, we're coming in. Honey. Aisha's here. Hi, Aisha. I want you to be a good girl for Mommy. Okay. So, uh, please, I don't want you to feel overwhelmed. Think of it as a loose guide. A basic schedule, list of where things are. - Okay. - Any number you could possibly need. Including her therapist. And, um, some blank pages for you at the end to make your own. Okay. Is this, uh... is this weird? - No. - Okay. Um... I mean, it might be a little bumpy at the beginning, but we will... we'll catch our stride. Yes, I'm sure. May I... Oh, of course. Of course. Thank you. - Mm-hmm. - Thank you. Thank you. Wow. All right. Okay. Can I clean your hands? - Are you hungry? - Yeah. Yes. Good. Okay. This is for you. You have your spoon. Bon appétit. Why are you looking at my food? You want to try it? Okay. Take your spoon. Try just a little bit. You like it? - C'est bon? - C'est bon. - C'est délicieux? - C'est délicieux. Good job, Rose. Your French is so good. Lamine. Is he near? You know keeping track of your son... is like trying to hold water. Let me get him. Hi, Mama. Lamine, my baby. Are you being a good boy? Aunty Mariatou tells me you're not listening. - She's lying. - Ah?! You call your aunty a liar? I heard you went to Musa's birthday party. Was it fun? They had so much food. I ate too much. There wasn't anything else that happened? Lamine? Why did you bite Musa? He took my toy. I don't want to hear about any more trouble. When you come here, you will have so many toys. Okay. Will it be cold? Very cold. There will be snow on the ground. Remember the pictures I sent you? Looks like white cotton candy. White cotton candy. I will have a very warm coat waiting for you. Lamine? Hello? I don't know if you can hear me, but I will see you so soon, my love. ♪ She say she want a man... ♪ Aisha! Sallay! You look beautiful. - Wow. - Look at you.

Picky doesn't even begin to describe your eating habits, Rose. So, listen, Adam is coming home earlier than expected, so I'm gonna need all of your help tomorrow getting everything together. Okay. I'm very excited for you to meet him. - Okay, yes. Looking forward. - All right. - I'll see you ladies soon. - Okay. - Bye. - Bye-bye. Hey. Sorry I am late. Things got crazy. I promise to text next time. Rose is in bed. Great. Uh, everything went smooth? No tantrums? No, no, none at all. She is so relaxed with you. You kept all the receipts? Yes. They are all here. You are amazing. Uh, one small thing. I was wondering if you could do an overnight tomorrow. I know we didn't discuss Friday nights, but I have a feeling things might go a little late, and I'd like you to keep an eye on Rose. We agreed on, uh, 100 for the overnight rate, right? No, it was, um... it was 150. Oh. Okay. 150. Okay. Okay. Good night, Amy. All right, have a good night. - Okay. You, too. Thank you. - All right. Hey, no. Lamine. Hi, Mommy. Sing "Ayo Nene." Mama is in the computer. Okay, okay, okay, okay, wait, wait. Come on. Say bye-bye. Say bye-bye. Bye. Sir, you can put the wine here. And, um, you can leave that there. Thank you. Rose? Rose? I'm coming to get you. Rose. I wonder where she is. - You found me! - I did! I found you. You were under the bed. Oh, so smart. Okay, ladies and gentlemen. - In our left corner, we have Rose. - Here. And in our right corner, we have the reigning champion, Madame Rainbow. One, and two, and three! Let's go! Oh, Rose is down for the count. You beat me. I have lost my title. You two are having fun. Go to Mommy. I'm tired. Oh. Too much play. I can see that. You're tired, huh? Hmm? Don't go far. Thank you for picking up the dry cleaning. I didn't think to bring anything fancy. Oh, gosh. It's my fault. I should've told you. It's just that my head is in a million different places with work and... You know. But it's fine. Oh, wait. You know what? Oh, my... I swear this dress was made for your skin. I mean, geez. Mahogany red. Yeah. Imperial red. Wine red. The whole family. Okay. Wow. Oh. It's very tight. Oh, it's... perfect. Okay. Exactly. At least he thought it. In the very least, yes. Thank you. Well, hello there. Mm, mm. - Nice to see you. - Hey, hold on. Hold on. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Stop, stop, stop. Just let me put my shit down. Why are you dressed like that? I'm sorry, but we haven't even... Surprise! Surprise. Daddy! Hi. Hey, I got something for you. Wow. Anansi the Spider. Welcome back, Adam. - Bonjour! - Hey. Except that that kind of sounds like PC bullshit. Seriously, just tell me, how does burning shit down help the cause? Are you cool waxing philosophical and being the devil's advocate? Listen, the devil's got enough help. You didn't care about the message - in the first place. - Tell me, how does... -Exactly. - No, no, Richard, it's fine. - Burning shit down and-and-and looting stores in your own fucking neighborhood help the cause? This is not a rhetorical question, people. Okay. Uh, I'm sorry. You're gonna have to bear with me a little bit. Um... Amy and I had talked about hiring someone, but I didn't know that she had. It's lovely to meet you, but it's a little bit of a surprise. She asked me to pay you for tonight. Anyway, I think from here on out, she'll keep track, but... - Thank you. - Yeah. Uh... Yeah, okay. - You can laugh. - It's not bad. I was just in, uh... in Lille, France. They had an uprising there around police violence. - Oh. Mm-hmm. - Yeah. Yeah, that kid, he had a real fire in him. Maybe the best public speaker I've ever seen. He was like Malcolm X. They hung on his every word. He's dead now. What happened? Police said it was gang-related. - I'm going to go to bed now. - Please, go to sleep. - Okay. - I wish I could. - Bonne nuit. - Bonne nuit. Lamine. Lamine. You know it's a different time in America? Now it's night there. Before we leave the beach... Lamine, tell Mommy bye-bye. Bye, Mommy. Thank you. Dakar, Senegal, right? Yes. When will they get it? About two business days. That's cool? Yes. Thanks, Nikki. How's your little chocolate drop? He's good. He's coming to America, finally. Yes. I want him to celebrate his birthday with me. He coming to live or visit? To live, thank God. Word! African boy coming to the Big Apple. Okay! - Let's go. - All right. Relax, y'all. Y'all ain't got no job to go to. Aisha, you all set. Kiss those cheeks for me, all right? Bye. Mm-hmm. I was like, this girl has forgotten about me now. - No call, no text, no visit. - No, no, no. They own me, Sallay. - I have no life. - My dear, who are you telling? I've been braiding since last night. This is my only customer today, and then I'm going to sleep. Mm, work until you die. The American dream, right? Sallay, I told you about pulling on my edges. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Have you thought about going back? - You know, to live. - To live? Where? With what money? What are you talking about? I know. Nigeria has definitely seen the last of me. I'd rather be asleep in America than asleep in Africa. At least here, when you work, you see the money. Mm. Do we? I think maybe if you apologized to Lamine's father and his wife, maybe they can help you. You know, send you money or something. Apologize? For what? It is him who should apologize. For impregnating every teen girl on her way to school. He knew he was married when he paid for my school fees. When he gave me money for food, clothes, my sick mother. Trust me, I know how it is. All these big men that play with little girls, and it's always the little girls who are punished. He doesn't care whether his own son lives or dies. He has not met him. You know that? Can you imagine? Cut me off when I was pregnant. I remember the night I found out. I went to the beach. The moon was so big. The water was so cold at my feet. This one I would keep. Lamine is the best thing that happened to me, Sallay. He is my greatest work. He's a beautiful boy. I can't wait for him to meet you, huh? His new girlfriend. He will love you. I know. He's a ladies' man. I've missed you. I just want you to be happy, Aisha. You can't just work from morning till night, night till morning. You need to get out. I'm okay, Sallay. I'm fine.

You ready to go? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Hi, Aisha. - Hi. What time do you get off today? Um, I'm not sure. I was going to ask. Amy's here, but she's, um, resting. You, uh... you want to come to dinner with us? Um, are-are you sure? Yeah. - You want me to come, Rose? - Good? - Okay. - Let's get some shoes on you. I don't know what you did to her, but she hasn't eaten this much in months. - Really? - It's nice. She loves to eat. Whose child are you talking about? I mean... I-I make her some Senegalese food, and she loves it. Rose, you like the chebu jën, yes? - C'est bon? C'est bon? - C'est bon. What did you do before you came here? - I was a teacher in Senegal. - Right. Of course you were. I, um... I-I studied English and French in school. You're a wonderful teacher. And you're clearly very smart, Aisha. I know... I can tell you're not gonna be with us for very long. Much as I'd like to keep you. Can I ask you something? Sure. I am having a difficult time with the hours. Thank you. I don't mind working the hours, but I think Amy forgets sometimes, um, to pay me. Um, there are many hours I have not been paid. About a week's worth of pay. I'm sorry. I'll talk to her. I won't say you brought it up. I'll talk to her. Well, I was wondering if... if it's possible if you could be in charge of my pay since your hours seem more flexible. Uh, I would like to, but... Adam? Is that you? - Oh, my God. Hi. - Oh, my God. How are you? Hey. You look amazing. - It's nice to see you. - Nice to see you. - Hi. - Remember Rose? Last time I saw you, you were just a teeny, tiny thing. - Bonjour. - Oh, my gosh, how cute! This is Aisha. Aisha, this is Christie. Hi. I'm gonna pay the bill, but, uh, you guys should go on ahead. But I will talk to her about that at home. Okay. Thank you. Okay, Rose. On y va. - Hello. - Hi. So, you following me or what? - Do you want me to be following you? - Oh. I like how you said that. Uh, so you gonna tell me where you from?

Okay, starts with an "S." ♪ Sierra Leone. ♪ - No. - No? South Africa. Mm. Okay. Okay. Senegal. - O... kay! - Wow. Ah... We got a winner. Yo. You didn't think I knew that, huh? Yo, but let me ask you this, though. Who has the best jollof rice? - 'Cause let Nigerians tell it, I mean... - Mm. Let Nigerians tell it, they have the best of everything. Oh, let Nigerians tell it, they have the best of...? Okay. What do you know about jollof rice? What don't I know about jollof rice? Jollof rice over here, jollof rice over there. Jollof rice in that bag. Yeah, I know you snuck it in there. Okay. Good to see you. Good night, Miss Aisha. Bishop. What did I say are the rules when you come with Daddy to work, hmm? Don't wander the hallway because then Daddy will get fired. All right, now, we almost out of here, okay? Hey. You all right? You look like you saw a ghost. No, no. Just tired. They let you bring him here? Let me? No. Shit happens. I brought him. - My dad has a crush on you. - Okay. I mean, he ain't lying, though. So, what, you think I can see you? I mean outside of here. I think you could. Goodbye, Bishop. Hello. You've reached Aisha. I can't come to the phone, but leave a message and I will call you back as soon as possible. Thank you. Wow. See, I can't believe you got me leaving voice mails. When you gonna let me take you out finally? Come through. We'll have a good time. My grandmother won't take no for an answer. Tea? I've got hibiscus, ginger, turmeric. Thank you. Enjoy. I feel like I've met you before. Very possibly. I lived all over West Africa for ten years. Fell in love with that continent. I miss my country. Every day. The good parts. Do tell me about the bad parts. Hmm. Ah. That's one of my favorites. It's an interpretation of Mami Wata. Some believe that the mermaid lures sexuality, money and promises of fertility, but they're very dangerous, unpredictable and impermanent. I feel like I saw her. Them. My grandmother believed in magic. But... me, I never did. Whether you do or not, you are magic. What's your boy's name? How do you know? All right. Sorry, sometimes Grandma like to ask a lot of questions. Does she ask them of all the women that come through here? Only the ones that pique my interest. But there haven't been many. That pique your interest? Or it's time to go. Mm, I love you, Grams. Stay out of trouble, all right? - Mm, maybe. - Okay. Okay. It was really nice to meet you. Lamine. So... - Hmm? - Have you done soul food before? - Is this soul food? - This is soul food. - Wow. No, I haven't. - No. Okay. - Uh, so there is one rule. One rule only. - Okay. What's that? - Eat everything. - Okay. Thank you. - That was very good. - Mm-hmm. It means, uh, it was delicious, it was wonderful. - Thank you. - Yes. - No. - Yes. Okay, look. You have to try this. I-I'm so full. Oh, but this is the best cheesecake on the East Coast. - So you have to. Please. - Okay. Come on, just one bite. - Mm-hmm. Mm! - Mm. We got a winner. Can I ask you something? Of course. Ask me anything. Your grandmother... Ah... Um... Well... most people are born with the ability to see. - Oh, she's a witch. - A witch? Nah. A priestess. - Like a psychic? - Like a psychic. In Senegal, we call 'em... we call this marabout. That's Grams. Marabout. Marabouts. Uh, we'll call her, we'll tell her today, change her business card from "intuitive consultant" and put "marabout." She's lovely. - Yeah. - Mm. Forget the marabout. You have a son? Yes, I do. Do you want to see a picture of him? I do. - Yes. Yes. - All right. What's his name? His name is Lamine. And what's that mean? It means "chosen one." "Chosen one." Ooh, the chosen... Okay. I get it now. Yes. Look at this brother. And that smile... what? He's beautiful. You know that? Thank you. - He's coming soon for his birthday. - Mm. I haven't seen him in almost a year. Wow. That is... like a lifetime for a child. Yes, I know. And you? - And me? - Yes. You have how many kids? Ooh. Five. Five? - Four plus Bishop? - Four plus Bishop. - And how many mothers? - Ooh. Five. Yeah, I don't like to double-dip, you know? I like to spread it around New York. One in Brooklyn, one in Harlem, one in Queens. Oh, gosh. I had you, though. -I got you. You believed me for a second, though. -No. No. - Yeah, you did. I saw that face. - I knew you were lying. You were like, "Let me get my purse." Nah, man, just my little knucklehead Bishop. - Just Bishop? - Just Bishop. I promise. Mm. Well, I try not to judge. Don't want people judging me. - That's real. - Mm. I respect it. Was the woman in the pictures in your house... is that your mother? Yeah. Yeah. - Uh... - I'm sorry. No. My mom has been talking to herself, laughing at the jokes inside her head since I can remember. I used to hate when she would come pick me up from school. Folks used to see her before I did. Pacing back and forth, banging on the lockers, making up people in the hallway. So I started pumping weights. You know? Dressing fly. No one would talk shit to me about my schizophrenic ma. - Is she... - Dead. Mm-hmm. My mother died when I was 12. What happened? It was cancer.

Leave a message. Why did you change your voice mail message, Mari? Please keep Lamine up for me. I get off late these days. - Hi. - Hi, dear. - Hello. - Cynthia. Florence. - Aisha. - Nice to meet you, Aisha. Yeah, it's nice to meet you. Chloe! Come on, baby. Time to go. We got to go. - Shit, Cynthia! - You watch your mouth, David. Go on and play now. You can use the exercise. No manners. Parents too busy letting him eat junk. I try to cook real food, but everything too spicy. Curry too spicy, salt too spicy, air too spicy. So, why you make the boy call you by your first name? Well, my baby Elizabeth, she know better. She not gonna know a thing when she burn up. You better put sunscreen pon dear Lizzie. Police will lock you up quick fast if you make them people children sick. You know them quick to say "abuse." Speaking of abuse, remember that Dominican nanny, Sonia? Mm? You heard what happened to Sonia? Sonia was sick... the kind you can't see. Slit her employers' child throat from ear to ear... How could you let her out of the park? Someone will report you. You okay? "'Hold on, son, "'for if you fall, "Death is going to get you, ' "Anansi the spider said to his child. "However, the boy could not hold on any longer. "Therefore, he fell. "Death caught the boy "and opened the burlap bag. "'It is your father I want, not you.' "Then he placed the child into the burlap bag. "Another of Anansi's daughters cried out to her father. "'Papa, please, my hands are tired. I am going to fall.'" Is Anansi bad, Aisha? Hmm. Do you know the word "filou"? Filou? - Trickster. - Trickster. Anansi is this big. Mm-hmm. And most of the people who bother Anansi are as big as you or as big as me or bigger. Therefore, he uses his intelligence to survive. Sometimes he is good. Sometimes he is very bad. But he is a survivor. Survivant. Survivant. Survivor. Yes. Are you ready to tell me why you left the park, Rose? Anansi told me to. Sorry it's late. I just want to hear your voice. I miss you. Very soon. Very soon. Always very soon. It's true, Lamine. I love you. Love you, too, Mommy. Aisha. Why are you still here? I told Adam to let you go. Where is he? I don't know where Adam is. I haven't seen him. Right. Um... I got a promotion. I mean, not a raise yet, but, uh, um... You happy for me? I mean, you know what it's like, right? Being a woman. Overseeing everything. Expected to go and get drinks with the guys every Friday night just to, like, pretend you're one of them. But we'll never be one of the guys, will we? 'Cause it's a fucking boys' club. Okay. Do me a favor. Watch Adam. Good night. Aisha. Aunty? Rose? Come here. - What have you been doing? - Daddy. It's her bedtime. I was just going to put you to bed. You ready for bed, piglet? Come on. Go with Aisha. Oh. Hey. Before I forget, um... Amy's working late, but I know today's supposed to be payday, right? - Yes. Thank you. - You're welcome. - Say, "Bonne nuit, papa." - Bonne nuit, papa. Bonne nuit, Rosie. Okay. - Hi. - Hi. I was just gonna come find you. You hungry? Um, yes. Good. How was she today? She was fine. Good. I got this extra spicy. Amy hates hot food. Says it dulls the taste buds. Adam. Mm-hmm? She has not paid me what I am owed. The thing is... I need to bring my son here. - Your son? - Yes. How old is he? He will be seven in a few days. All right, well, I'll tell you what. I will, uh... I'll advance you some of the money till we can figure this out. I'm sorry, things have been a... little tight around here for everyone. It is not an advance. It is what I am owed. Okay. I, uh... I could go to the ATM, but, um, it's a start. - Thank you. - Mm. Mm. Fuck. Ow. Ow. I guess I deserved that. Hey. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that. I'm sorry. Don't tell Amy about... that. She's a little, uh... She's a little by the book sometimes. Might complicate things for you. Hello. Assalamu alaikum. - Hello. Mari? - Ah, I am just playing. Leave a message. Head up, head up. Come on. Kick. Aisha, look. Five, four, three, two, one. Yeah, good job! - I got it! - Let's go. Ready to go? - Everybody ready? Ready? - Three, two, one! Let's go, guys! Let's go. Keep kicking. - Got you! - Let's go. Keep kicking. Keep kicking. Are you okay? I'm fine. Anansi and Mami Wata are figures of survival and resistance for oppressed people. They challenge the dominant order. Subverting it through chaos, anarchy, creative energy. They refuse to be ruled by the human or the divine. I wish I knew what they wanted from me. You should be asking what they want for you. I had to learn the hard way. They tried to warn me. But I ignored the signs. That grief, that guilt... lingers with you. She was beautiful. Losing her... almost broke me. But... I had to forgive myself. I didn't fail her. The system did. She wasn't meant to be held down here. She was meant to fly. She started threatening to hurt others. Herself. A manic episode like I had never seen. I wasn't so much scared for myself. I was scared for Malik. He was just a small boy then. I called the police. Cops didn't ask any questions. Didn't care. Stormed in with their preconceived notions, ready for rage. Slammed Gloria down like a rabid animal. Exposed her body. Handcuffed her. Started to tase her, so I threw myself between them. When they took her away in that car, in her eyes... I saw something... that had shifted. The spirits equipped us with resilience. But the spirits' tools aren't always kind. Some want blood, an eye for an eye. Some just want you rebirthed so you can persist. One can never really define good and evil. My question for you, Aisha: How do you use your rage? Is it your superpower, or is it your kryptonite? Manger. Chebu jën. Yes. Okay. It's good? Mm-hmm. What are you feeding her? I didn't know you were here. That's not what I asked you. I work... I work so hard. So hard. And the one time I come home sick, I find you feeding my daughter food that is way too spicy for her tummy! What is even in this? What if she's allergic? Should I feed her this? Hmm? Or this? Or this? Since I started, I have been buying her food or making some of my own. Did you ever wonder how your child was eating, or are you too busy to care? Honey... I want you to go pick out a book for Mommy to read to you, okay? Any country you want. Let Mommy and I talk. It's okay. Now that I have your attention... My overtime hours. Did you subtract the hours you spent losing track of my daughter? My time is not free. This is a small community, and nannies talk. So do mothers. I am a mother, too. I thought so. I knew that from the moment I met you. It can't happen again. It won't. I need an overnight from you tomorrow. - No. - I need to get out of here. - No. - I need to get away. I can't fucking think in this overpriced shoebox. So, 7:00 to 7:00... 150 flat rate is very reasonable. 250. You drive a very hard bargain. In advance. You think cash is just laying around? Plus unpaid overtime. All right. I'll get money from the ATM. Adam will pay you in the morning. It all comes from me anyway. Aisha, no. Don't leave. Don't leave me. Rose, I'll be back, okay? - Aisha, no! - It's okay. - Please don't leave me! - That's enough. - I'll be back. - Come to Mommy. - Okay? I'll be back. - Hey. Come to me, all right? You want to go to the dollhouse? - No. - Huh? Come on! - No! Get off me! - Rose! - I don't want to go. - Settle down. Settle down. Breathe. Breathe. I'm with you, okay? Ten toes on the floor, okay? Say it with me: "Ten toes on the floor." - Ten toes on the floor. - Ten toes on the floor. You're okay. Okay. Breathe. Okay, you're okay. You're okay. Hey. That's enough. Come here, Rosie. Ah, man. That's gotten pretty bad. You see it, right? The mold. Yeah. I didn't realize it was so out of control. Um, I'll make up the sofa for you tonight. It's actually much more comfortable than that bed, to be honest. Did, uh... did Amy happen to mention where she was going? No. She didn't say. All right. I'm gonna go. - I'll see you tomorrow, okay? - Okay. - Bye, Aisha. - Bye.

Why would you say that? Rose. What do you know about Lamine? Why did you say that? Anansi told me. He said it's my fault. Aisha. Sorry we keep, uh, missing your call. Uh... my cell, I had to... You know, you never ask about me. My mother isn't doing well. She's getting worse. But, anyway, uh... I'll call you back. Talk soon. Took Rosie to breakfast, and I didn't want to wake you.

Wanted to tell you. Tell me what?! You said you would have our ticket sooner. Where is he? None of this would've happened had you bought the tickets earlier. We looked away only for a minute... Mariatou! Where is Lamine?! When we went to the beach. The waves... were too strong. Didn't know how to tell you. He drowned. We looked everywhere. Going to get some air. - You gonna be okay? - Mm. ♪ Falling slowly to the ground ♪ ♪ Fully lost and fully found ♪ ♪ Running late but almost there ♪ ♪ Only stop to check the mirror ♪ ♪ Backpack full of things ♪ ♪ No one told me what to bring ♪ ♪ Teach me how to swim ♪ ♪ Make me born again ♪ ♪ Ah... ♪ Aisha. Okay. It's okay. - She's pregnant. Be careful. - It's okay. It's okay.
