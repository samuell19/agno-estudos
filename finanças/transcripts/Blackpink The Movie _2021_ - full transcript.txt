How it all started? That's a big question. I think everybody has like a different start to how they got to this one place where we all kind of got together to create BLACKPINK. But me, personally, I came through just a simple audition and ended up practicing at YG Entertainment for about four years, I think it was. I'm the newest member out of all four of us. All I remember is practicing a lot, having a very strong drive, and a big goal ahead of us. It took a long time, but we made it and we debuted as BLACKPINK. YG's new girl group BLACKPINK set a new record by reaching number one in a network television music program in just 14 days after their debut. They have 27 videos, including the music video for "DDU-DU DDU-DU," with hundreds of millions of views… Setting various records… Surpassing the global pop stars… DAY 319 What is in store… BLACKPINK is finally having their first concert in Jamsil in their second year since their debut… -Hello, we are BLACKPINK. -Hello, we are BLACKPINK. BLACKPINK started off their world tour with their first concert. January 31st, 2021, BLACKPINK celebrates the 5th anniversary of their debut. They welcome fans around the world with online concerts… Our next guests are multi-platinum selling and chart-topping K-pop girl group you know. Please welcome BLACKPINK! BLACKPINK THE MOVIE Fans around the world are looking forward to seeing BLACKPINK in person to celebrate their 5th anniversary. I think those were really hectic moments. Because it was our first time. I'm facing the stage right now and those were the seats for BLINKS. There was a stage that stretched out to the front and we ran underneath the stage. I think the most nervous moment is when we walk toward the backstage with the anticipation of meeting our fans and performing for them. I think that’s the most nervous moment. You know, we haven't been able to perform live for a while now. And now that I think back at it performing on stage is one of the best parts. I feel alive when I see our fans singing along to my song and enjoying it. That feeling of success like, "Wow I did it." "They’re dancing together like I am!" When I feel that, I think that’s when I feel most alive. It’s upsetting that we can’t have the fans watch the performance. But I think it just makes us more, like, you know, gives us more space to look forward to that day, and when that day comes for us, we'll actually be in one room together. That would be a very very special moment. Wouldn’t there be much to talk about when we meet? From now on? So I'm looking forward to it. BLACKPINK: THE SHOW THE SHOW D-1, D-2 THE SHOW D-3, D-4 THE SHOW D-5 The Show. THE SHOW D-4 Performing with the band during the concert is -definitely really great. -What's next? The energy is actually unreal. All the instruments in the back, singing live. But the production is so much different too, so… I’m finally getting, "This is what I was doing for two years," you know. THE SHOW D-3 How do we go in here? We're doing our best here so that BLINKs can also enjoy even the process of waiting for our next performance. Please look forward to it! THE SHOW D-2 We worked really hard to prepare for this concert, so I hope you watch it more than ten times. See you soon, bye. THE SHOW D-1 Let's go. Hello. Hi, I'm here. What are we doing right now? -Emcee Girl. -Emcee. -Okay. -Yes. We got here today for the rehearsal. It's for tomorrow, and what is this rehearsal for? I believe it's a rehearsal for The Show. THE SHOW D-DAY BLACKPINK LIVESTREAM CONCERT: THE SHOW I wanted to make it more perfect because I was not satisfied. It would've been great if we had more time. I’m so nervous. LISA BLACKPINK THE MOVIE It was the most fun I had in my life. A LISA FILM And I had the best time of my life. Like for the rest of my life, I think I’ll continue to remember that moment, that feeling. A lot of things happened. There were happy times, and there were sad times. I think those were the happiest times. Oddly, when I try to recollect difficult times, I can’t seem to remember them. I just erase everything that has to do with difficult times from my mind without realizing it. I don’t think I’m overly positive or outgoing. I am a normal person just like everyone else. Every day I’m like this. I’m like this every day. I knew what I wanted to do since I was young. I believe I am a very lucky person. I had a clear goal to become a superstar in the future. I worked hard to make my dream come true. I try to think that I am happy, without having to stress out too much. I hope others could also think like that. Life is super short. PRETTY SAVAGE JISOO I guess I thought that I am a lot stronger than I believed. There are times when I feel hurt or when I go through hardships, but my way of overcoming those times is preparing more for what's to come or focusing on thinking about how I can better move forward. A JISOO FILM Attitude towards life? That’s a hard one. Well… I think I just live my life enjoying every moment. What I felt throughout the process is that if I think too far ahead about the things that hasn't happened yet. I could also get anxious and worry about it, then end up missing many things. So I try to live in the moment and try to have fun, I think. 2019 WORLD TOUR: BLACKPINK IN YOUR AREA Oh yes! It's almost time to meet all the BLINKs from all over the world who have waited so long. I am very nervous, and since you’ve waited so much, I am going to show you the best. Show us a lot of support and enjoy it. SEOUL BANGKOK Thailand is also Lisa's hometown, so I think it's more meaningful to start our world tour in Lisa's hometown. Starting from Thailand, we're going to North America and Europe to meet BLINKs around the world. I'm so honored and looking forward to it. The phrase "BLACKPINK's world tour" still feels very foreign to me. I still can't believe it. I prepared lots of fun stuff for our concert and want to do more exciting things in different countries. That's how I feel. I hope many BLINKs around the world come. It's gonna be fun. What’s up, Bangkok! It was very touching. I think I'm very lucky to see them, I could really tell how hard they tried, from the beginning to the end. I hope they take care of themselves. I hope everyone stays healthy because they have to go perform all around the world. We're going to visit BLINKs in other countries too, so please wait a little more. We'll be there very soon, and we'll show you a great performance. Wait a little, BLINKs.

MELBOURNE, SYDNEY Hi Melbourne, I’m Rosé. WELCOME HOME ROSIE BANGKOK Hello, I’m Lisa. I’m so happy to be back here in Thailand. All four of us, we did really really well, and I'm very proud of each and every one of us, cause we went through a lot. Like, I know you guys only see the stuff that’s on stage but I feel like we all go through so much and I am very very proud… Now I'm going to cry. Everybody stop crying. -Everyone's crying. -Everyone's crying. I’m a little shy, but I want to tell everyone… Thank you again so much, BLINKs. We love you. Thank you so much. We love you guys so much, and we have so much more coming. This is just the beginning for us. We always love you guys. Thank you. Pure… Poetic… Utmost Passionate… Never Dying… Tangible… Forever young… Unselfish… You and me… Desire… ROSÉ BLACKPINK THE MOVIE When you’re growing up you just feel like there are no limits to your goals and dreams. I've had a very hard time here and there, because it was quite challenging as a 16-year-old, growing up in a whole different culture. It didn’t seem realistic at the time but I just knew that I would make it come true. I actually envy myself as a trainee because I do believe that I was very strong-willed, very stubborn, so sure about my future and so determined to reach my goals and I knew I would get there for some reason. I always have to think back on how passionate I was towards music and how much music gave me a lot of the part. And it turned out to become my life now to the current day too, so… Yeah, music is a big part. Preparing for music in itself is always a personal thing. Being able to explore for the first time what my music will be about, and what I’m gonna be showing my fans is a very rewarding experience. During the preparations for The Show I think I was also preparing my solo project I had just finished the last shoot for "Gone," so that was the second music video I did back-to-back. To be honest, I think it's the first time I'm actually saying this out loud that it really was a challenge. But at the same time I was very, very grateful for the opportunities that I was given. It was a lot of fun creating, thinking, and just making all things come to life, all of my, our ideas. I think I tried my best. I don’t think I would go back and change anything, because I really did try to pour my heart and soul into it. JENNIE I feel like as far as I remember ever since I was a kid, I’ve always been the shy kid. I didn’t really like talking in front of a lot of people. I have a strive on searching for something new inside where I want to develop that into something of my own, and create something that hasn’t been out to the world. But when it comes to performing on stage, I think I put on this entire new self, where I’m not afraid. When I’m performing, I forget about everything. It’s just all about me, expressing myself, expressing our music. I guess I do have a switch inside somewhere where I turn it on and off, but it’s not something that I do purposely. I think it reacts with music. And the very first energy that I meet whenever I first jump up on the stage. I wanna say it’s just something that I was born with, because I’m proud of it, and I'm happy doing it. So yeah. I think our identity is rather fixed. I like to think that we have a lot of pride in having both colors, black and pink. But because of that, we’re still in the process of continuously experimenting. And fortunately, rather than not being able to predict it, we continue to go forward in the direction that we want. I just enjoy the whole process. We all grew up in different cultures. These various cultures overlapped and a group was born. But instead of forcing them into one we worked as a group without losing each of our individuality. I think that rather emerged as the color of the group BLACKPINK. I think we shine the brightest when we do what we love to do. Now that’d be music, right? When we are fully expressing what we want to express, that’s when we shine the brightest. So I think it’d be great for us to show a lot of things that we enjoy doing in the future. As we do this, we’ve always done everything thinking, "We could show something like this. This time, we can show this." I think we can continue to show different sides of us. We plan on continuing to do what we want and show it. Five years is not too short and not too long of a time, right? But a lot of different things happened. There were happy times, and sad times. I think those were the happiest times of my 20s. When we were on the tour, I’d always feel hectic thinking about which city we have to go next and such. But after seeing this video, I could see that we laughed a lot and really enjoyed our time together. When we first debuted, we faced all kinds of experiences. Back, then, there was a fear about whether or not we were doing well, feeling uncertain about some things. When we had our first concert, what we say on stage is also a very important part of our concert. I was really nervous, like, "Let’s not make any mistake." It’s already been a little over two years since we debuted. And to be able to have a concert at such a big venue in Korea in Seoul like this… Even as I’m saying it, I feel like we’ve improved very much. And it was all possible thanks to BLINKs. Right, everyone? We’ve been together since day one. I like to think we’ve grown a little bit seeing how we’ve become more comfortable with making a speech and looking after one another when we're on stage. I like to believe that we still have that energy from when we were trainees. I’m so moved, thank you all so much for coming. Since the four of us are in this together, we decided to have a talk on trusting each other more and trying to enjoy everything. Since then, it became more enjoyable to take on new challenges, we became more excited, and began to look forward to things. I think we grew up a little. We are always here for you, BLINKs, so please stay with us too. Thank you! When the four of us are together, we always laugh and talk just like we did when we were trainees. It’s just so fun to work together too. -I think we’re the same. -We are the same. Now we don’t even have to say a word. We just look at each other’s eyes and know. We just know. Tell us, Lisa. Yes. Thanks to all of your support and love, I will strive to work harder as Lisa of BLACKPINK, everyone. I love you, BLINKs. BLINKs. We just finished the last US show. Yay! Wow, I still can’t hear anything. Is my voice coming out alright? I’m so sad it’s already over. I'm sad to see it come to an end. It feels bittersweet. Over the past month and a half there were many new and exciting experiences. Still, I had a lot of time to relax in different cities. It was great. We performed a lot, and it was a meaningful time. I think I enjoyed every moment more than I thought I would. It was a meaningful tour, like a surprise gift. What I felt the most during the tour was… It really was a time for me to rethink of myself as a member of BLACKPINK. I honestly don’t think we’ve changed much just because it’s been five years. We haven’t changed much, but what's more reassuring is having fans by our side, who have always supported us for the last five years. There will be the sixth and the seventh anniversary in the future, and it feels like we’re getting stronger over the years. I really like the feeling of us and BLINKs becoming a lot closer. I can’t believe it's already been five years. I wish this movie gets a little bit of our BLINKs' frustration out, and it’s a good memory that we are also gonna have. And we can look back at it next year and talk about it, maybe? It’s a new step for us, I’m really glad that we got this opportunity. And I miss you guys. I feel like I cried a lot over the five years. When I watch the videos from my fans, I tear up. I was so touched when I just saw that video. Even now as I’m talking, I feel like I’m going to cry. Because those were such happy times. Five years ago, we were five years younger, and it was probably the same with our BLINKs. As we continued to grow, I was very happy to be able to share that time with BLINKs. I miss them so much since we haven’t been able to meet lately. But because we missed each other so much, when we meet again, I’m so excited at the thought that we’ll be able to greet them with the biggest joy. Thank you so much for always worrying about us, and above all, thank you that you always show us love and support. We miss you so much. BLINKs have always been there by our side no matter which year of our career it is, showing us so much unchanging love. That's what makes us want to move forward further. I hope you stay with BLACKPINK all the way, as if we are lifelong companions. Thank you, and love you always. Whenever we talk about how we feel inside, I always have nothing to say. I feel very shy about it, but… What should I say? There are so many things that I wanted to say, but… To keep it short… Thank you so much. Thank you so much for loving me, as me, as Lisa of BLACKPINK. When I was a kid I never imagined I could be loved by people all over the world. Honestly, thank you for always supporting me. Yeah, that’s all. I don't know how to describe my feelings other than saying thank you. Thank you BLACKPINK for showing us that we can do everything, what we love, when we really believe in it. We love you. Keep going hard ladies. We got you. We ride or die. We love you. I will forever support BLACKPINK, and thank you for everything. Me too. -You're a queen. -We love you. I love you guys, and you guys are doing so well. And I hope to get to see you again. As we go up on the stage like this, we can see our light sticks shaking and hear the cheering. It’s so pretty. Some people set it so that it beeps. You can set it like that. Every time I hear it, I get so excited. It's so encouraging. -BLACKPINK! -BLACKPINK! -BLACKPINK! -BLACKPINK! -BLACKPINK! -BLACKPINK! We’ll cherish this truly precious memory. Thanks to all of you supporting and loving us wholeheartedly. We’ll keep this memory and strive to grow further as BLACKPINK. Thank you. Stay with us, BLINKs. WE'LL STAY FOREVER Just once more, we’ll see you once more closely before we go. So pretty, our BLINKs. Please support us and stay excited till the end. -We love you. -We love you. BLACKPINK FOREVER JISOO, JENNIE, ROSÉ, LISA YOU GUYS ARE TOTALLY AWESOME THANK YOU FOR BEING THE LIGHT OF MY YOUTH So may I make it short and do it with a gesture? -Suer. -Okay, I’ll go with my gesture. -Since everyone expresses differently. -Right. BLACKPINK, BLINKs, forever. -Thank you for reacting. -Hey, wait. -Nice. -What is this? I think it’s great. Can you just finish like this? BLACKPINK, BLINKs, forever. Thank you. Shall we try it together? Shall we? Like this, BLACKPINK, BLINKs. forever. Okay, five, six, seven, eight. BLACKPINK, BLINKs, forever. Oh, thank you guys! So funny. And, I miss you guys. Translated by
