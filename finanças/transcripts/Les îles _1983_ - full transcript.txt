THE ISLANDS Today on Les Ardoines, a heavy atmosphere weighs down; a widespread fear A fear coming from the depths of time. And each islander comes to know it sooner or later. After the dry season the wells are low. Fresh water becomes scarce Many springs have already run dry, At first the inhabitants only mention it in passing, But the threat becomes very rapidly urgent... real. Then we talk about it openly, Before recalling stories, memories... All the islands struck by drought. And the fog intensifies the remarks. A distress signal has already been launched and Edouard responded without hesitation. Whatever the price, Edouard braved the sea and the fog to bring help to Les Ardoines and to Fabrice. Now we are further in, do you know where you are? Not at all. In fine weather maybe. But today... It's very simple, go straight on, but don't leave the path. Their house is lit up, they are waiting for us. A man of the North, Fabrice had left the snow and winds for Les Ardoines. He had chosen this island as soon as he saw it... bathed in sunshine. In the distance, it appeared... as a place of peace... and beauty... away from the din of the mainland. The sun, a memory... an almost imperceptible image red... And then with the rocks in the bay, no one ventures there any more. not even a passer-by, Well, there's the postman. But tell me, you weren't obliged to do it? You weren't... -No. It was simple... I got your message, I jumped in my cart. But is it really so.. serious? It's not easy... And then... Yes... that's it... It's bad. Did it start suddenly? All at once. And you've seen someone? Who, for instance? I don't know... an expert? Exactly... for him everything's normal. It's always happening in the islands. We were speaking about it. The islands... Do you remember? Our wells are dilapidated, it's true. But suddenly one well dries up. Then another. People become unsettled. They find that everything on the island is precarious. Then add the fog to all this... You understand, It's not like the mainland here. If one day a well runs dry on the mainland, it is a simple technical mishap. Here... it's more of a threat. The island itself is disturbed. And we with it. And then we remember other droughts... on other islands. Which means leaving, emigration. And we say: "Here we go again." "We have to leave again." And next thing we decide otherwise. We say: "No, not this time." You mean... Yes, I do. Not this time. This time, we've decided to stay despite the hardship. And even after the last drop of water. A first drilling here. A well... 30 to 40 meters deep. It's deep, it's expensive but... it's necessary. There... A reservoir in brick and cement. We store the water there, it warms up before irrigating the crops. And then there, a new barn. With plenty of water, we shall grow crops and establish livestock. In this way we can pay it all back. I hope... Now you know... this money is absolutely necessary for the survival of the island. Send us a telegram. Send it quickly. Aren't you asleep? Shall I turn on the light? - No, don't. But tell me Thomas, what is your impression? I'll confess something to you. You remember my instructions to Edouard? It's strange, for a few seconds it seemed to me... that I was not speaking to Edouard... but that there were many other people in the fog. They were there...really. They were listening to us, those people who lived on our island centuries ago. Maybe also those who are to come... to live here... some time after us. I see still the face passing in my prayers. Close the shutters! After 3 months... Close the shutters! Imagine, the fog will go away from the island. People won't be so worried. You think so? Yes... I'm sure. Or maybe... it's the end. Excuse me... I'm sorry... But the rain... The storm... Did I wake you? - No, Sit down and warm yourself, I beg you. Are you unwell? I went out... Why? I don't know... lack of sleep, then the light in your house. I took the liberty of... Do you use this lamp for lighting? Yes, it's our custom. We find electric light harsh. We end up not seeing anything. Seeing... as one should. And then... with age, we like to take our time over things. Electric light is like a flash of lightning. It blinds you and then nothing. We don't live things any more. You've heard the evening... the cries... The whisperings in the wind? Not especially. Not tonight, but it happens. It happens? Yes. It happens a lot... the callers. The "callers"? - Yes. Excuse me. Excuse me. Go get the blue blanket. Cover him up. I wanted to warn you. And don't forget. No, don't worry... I never forget anything. Are you ready? Get ready! I'm counting. 1... 2... 3. I was told that you wanted to talk to me. You want to stay with us, is that right? And for what reason exactly? Many reasons. The first is that we like it here. Why, we don't know. We do a lot of seasonal work. But... this is the first time that we have the feeling that we're doing something... really doing something. Well... not necessarily something big... but still... When we arrived here, it was just for the harvest. Though now we have the impression that we've done something more. Something real for the island. And we feel involved. So... But have you ever lived on an island? No. This is the first. And you want to try it? Both of you? Absolutely. So... Stay. Very happy, yes. Very. Now it's true. Peace has returned. I was only afraid that... You know, I've had four new starts. Four islands. Les Ardoines is the fifth. So, one more time... But what we did today, is, however, very important. This is the first time, for sure, I've never heard about something like this. It's also important for the others... The other islands... Near or far. We must send our people. Explain everything to them. In all the islands Near or far. They have to know. It must be of help to them. Can you imagine... Always being able to rely on your own island, without worrying about leaving. Without fear. It's really wonderful. Suddenly we can breathe. Another, another... This one, this one... And this one too. You've had a lot these days. It looks like it. It means a lot of people are thinking about you. Aren't you happy? Well, goodbye Gérard, and have a good trip. How to bridge this gap? What we urgently need... is to know... what to do. What to do? What to do? Is there a higher priority than people's survival? Taking away people's bread, made from their own wheat. If that is the higher priority, then no. 'A part of the wages must be paid.' How? Think about the consequences, the laws. But I don't understand, Thomas. What consequences, what laws? What laws? If there exists a law which, in the name of some obligation, a law which takes away people's bread, well... it's not a law... it's something else. So you're not afraid? You're ignoring justice? Justice... No, no Thomas... It's not justice that I'm ignoring. Besides, it's time to go. One moment please. You know what you're doing is a serious thing. Stay a minute, we still have time. Let's try to find a more logical solution... More logical? What could be more logical than to give people what is rightfully theirs? You're wondering: why this meeting? why the urgency? We have just spent a difficult year. We've held out against all odds. But I owe you the truth. We've just seen the accounts. And our balance sheet is not good. We all need to know this now. Our balance sheet is not good. But it's temporary, because our island is opening up to us. It coming to life, and will make us live. But difficult year is ahead. That's all. Nothing to worry about. I am sure... I am... convinced... But since now we have all the water we need, why not sow twice a year? We have to sow more seed. - She's right. We've always thought about the hardships. Even now, we're thinking about them, without realising. The hardship is within us. Yes, that's true. We have to tell ourselves that a page has been turned for Les Ardoines. Listen... A year ago, you asked me to contact a credit agency. For a loan. - Yes. I saw two. Negative. Negative? It wasn't your accounts, it was the idea. But what idea? - The idea of an island. Or rather the idea of an island as seen from the continent. You see... What is an island exactly? A simple handful of land lost in the sea. It's not solid. It's not firm ground. There's no certainty that it will always stay in the same place. An island moves around, it travels. For them, it's even possible that one fine day it will go far away, And leave no trace. It's not solid, you see. ...the third bank wasn't against it, provided that I guaranteed repayment of the whole amount, plus interest. It was they who agreed to it. But only because of your guarantee? So that's how it is... I should have known better but... Thank you. Thank you. And Thomas? - I don't know. I had a fall a few days ago, And afterwards I was told that Thomas had left us. He had begun to doubt everything. Help! Help! Come, come, Sir, quickly! Quickly! Something bad! What? What's happened? Your sailboat...your sailboat. It's beyond belief! It's awful! It's hideous! I don't want to know who did this bad thing, who dared to do this. I don't want to meet him in the fields At my side or at sea. But only that he know that his act is abominable. Horrible! And that he leave as soon as possible! That he leave Les Ardoines! And never come back! Have I ever held anyone here by force? Things have not been easy lately, I know. And we're short of a lot of things. But now, only now when we are committed to a decisive test to save our island; suddenly the incidents multiply. A quarter of our crop burns. The salt lambs are falling ill. The sailboat takes off by itself. And on top of all this, the sale of thatch... a disaster. Our island is sick, it's true, but who dares to think that this is the end? Have you forgotten everything? Forty-five. Look... They are full and sweet. All full. Good work. Yes, and we're coming to the end. Already? Last cart, the very last one. But the next cart, will be for next year. The situation is clear now. It's no real surprise. As for Edouard... Why drag him down with us? He trusted us. What comes to us from the sale of Les Ardoines, will be just enough to pay back his debts, the indemnities. So... the island hasn't really been ours... for some time. Now it's done. The buyers will be here in a few days. They have other plans. They don't give a damn about the island's past... Soon there will be nothing left of us. Not a trace. Not a memory... the days of waiting... the grey days... The days of peace. The hour to choose has come. Maybe some would prefer to stay here. I can understand them. The mainland is closer than ever. And then... there's Doucemer. It's not far away either. Those who decide to go to Doucemer will find an island abandoned, but new. Nothing like Les Ardoines. It is we who will explore it. To those who decide to stay here, I say good luck. To the others... Bon voyage. But let's not forget... we lasted out a long time... and we're going to go on. That's why I won't say farewell to you... nor goodbye. We're impatient to set off, but to go where? Is this really what we want, what we are looking for? No. We're returning to the mainland only out of fear. It's fear and nothing else. We're running away from Les Ardoines, we reject Doucemer. But are we simply defeated? My answer is "no". Doucemer is there, waiting for us. So let's not hesitate, let's go back. Hélène... I want to go home. I want to go home. I want to. Please, Hélène. Stop! Stop! Stop! I want to go back. Stop! Stop! I want to go home. You've come back. Just in time... to see Doucemer rise up. How do you mean 'Doucemer rise up'? You'll see. There she is! Come on! Hurry up, she's rising up. They stayed there... Eyes fixed on the sea and the far distance. For it happened that in autumn... and depending on the angle of the sun, we could see Doucemer island emerging on the horizon. It was also a greeting> extended by Doucemer, as way of welcome... to the last survivors of Les Ardoines. It was finally over. They had just turned the page on Les Ardoines. For them, the island was no longer the symbol of so many lost battles. They were approaching a new land. With the promise of another life. More serene, perhaps, this time. They also thought of their companions. What would they do on the mainland? Would they be happy there? They came upon, the houses... still standing, still solid, which although abandoned for decades, still... retained an air of familiarity They visited these places without a word. As if engaged in a dialogue with those who had inhabited these dwellings long before them. They questioned them in silence and received soundless answers. It was enchanting. Our house is big. Just what we needed. A roof, that would improve things. I feel... that we have left behind a period of misfortune... of hardship. All that is far away. They're bringing in my boat. I'll go and help them. No, Father, you stay here. You've worked enough for one day. Luckily, there are still enough of us. You're right. I feel suddenly... very tired. A tiredness which has lasted many years. A tiredness... from a long way back. What about you? She's already gone. You don't look happy. Is it your dress? Do you want me to lend you one of mine? No. What's the matter? This dress... The last time I wore it, was one night at a dance on the mainland. It was wonderful. The people, the music, the colours... And it was the mainland. Maybe that's the nostalgia. So tell us, specifically, what your proposition is. We need tools. That's what we need. - And then? We need seaweed farmers. But we prefer to do the harvesting, storage, everything, ourselves. Our income will then be multiplied by four. So you'll harvest the seaweed, dry it yourselves, reduce it to ashes yourselves and sell us the soda cakes? Certainly. - So that's your proposition? That's our proposition. Well, your proposition, doesn't interest us. And seeing that we don't have a guarantee that after one year, when you're doing well, when you have your seaweed farmers, you won't deal with another group. It's true, we could do that... but we won't. - Tcha! And what's to stop you? I'm telling you that I won't, let's say for reasons of morality, for instance. Morality? But what morality? Yes, that's the point. What morality? If you had to run a company of 50 people... Just what I'm thinking. If you had to support a company of 50 people then believe me, it's not morality. That's not going to feed people all year round. Believe me... it's not morality. Believe me. - No, I don't believe you. Well, just to be clear, let's say a five-year contract? Five years is a long time. But I tell you that you will have our production, our harvest... Other algae as well? - As well. So then, we have an agreement. - Agreed. Well, I'm going to tell you, from the beginning we were sure that we would come to an agreement. This is now a done thing. And so like that you have your 19th litre. Not quite. I want you to know that we have just reached a compromise. A rather dangerous compromise... but time will tell. I'm all right. Don't worry. I feel very well. It's my heart that's tired. This damned heart. Leave it. Don't stir the ashes. It has to cool down by itself. You let them sit overnight, and tomorrow they will be hard as stone. And that's the "soda cake"? That's it... A bit of patience. You'll see your soda cakes. Tomorrow is not far off. ...to find at sunset, our Les Ardoines... Here is good. Let's stop. We're far enough. It's what he wanted. I remember this as if it were yesterday. He said that once on his boat, he would no longer be separated from us... from the island, and that if one day we needed him, he would come to our aid. It was his idea. You know, from all time there have been sailors, shipwrecked people lost at sea, who were saved no one knows how. There are sailors rescued who told about seeing a procession of men all dressed in white with lighted candles in their hands. walking on the rocks, and that's how the sailors were able to reach the coast. But you, what do you think about that, Mr. Fabrice? I don't know. I wonder... You know, sailors dream a lot. Maybe in their dreams they mix up what is true and what is from their dreams. In the end they believe that everything is true. But dreams... are real. Very... real. Do you think so Mr. Fabrice? That dreams are real? Yes, I believe so. Always. A good harvest. A very good harvest. You know, when I look at people who live on an island, I can tell you right away what they're capable of doing. Surely you're exaggerating a bit, Mr. Designy. No, no, not at all. It's a very good harvest. I mean it. You're surprised? I'll tell you a story, you'll see. He thinks that's all... To have a good return. And make a profit even after only 10 months. That's all. I ask you... Is this all that we wanted, all that we were looking for? Doucemer no longer corresponded to the idea Fabrice had of the islands. It had become just a business With its procedures... its account books... its balance sheets. He had to get away. Become an islander again and nothing more. Quick! Quick! Everyone! otherwise it will be too late. How? Run away? ...it is however an authentic piece. A piece of history. Do I hear 1,000? No? Fine. Sold for 850. Our last work of art for today, is a masterpiece. It's more than a painting. It is is a living person. Quiet, please. In flesh and blood. A woman. In a manner of speaking, she can be touched. She breathes. 5,000. I see that... you are impatient, you are ready to sacrifice your money for art. 9,000, Sir. Gentlemen, Ladies, what is art for? if not for our comfort... - 15,000. It's thanks to art... - Mostly thanks to our money! As I was saying, it's thanks to art that today we shall possess this completely alive and innocent creature... 17,000. We're at... I say 20,000. 20,000. 20,000. 20,000... once... 20,000... - 50,000. I think I heard 50,000. I said 50,000. Good God! 50,000. 50,000... once. 50,000... twice. 50,000... three times. Sold. ...our last offer of the day, a small island. Four hours from the mainland. Its name is Médusa. Near Médusa, runs a current of warm water 15 km from its shores, which results in a very mild temperature on the island throughout the entire year. On Medusa, so to speak, there is only one season. Medusa has fertile land. As for its geographical situation, it is outstanding. It is located here. Excuse me, it seems that this Medusa is so small, so tiny, that it defies all representation. It is so small, so tiny, that it doesn't even exist. I beg your pardon, did you say something? I'm just saying that your island...what's it called again? Medusa, Sir. Yes, your Medusa, is so tiny, that it doesn't even exist. It's in the direction of a mild climate? It's the same. - Too bad! Did you say "Paradise"? Sir... Listen... - As for me, I'm buying cash. Yes, Sir... I'm listening. This island... Medusa... is two hours from Doucemer and two and a half hours from another island: Les Ardoines which has now become well-known, famous for its places of relaxation and leisure... its hotels, its golf courses. Once I took refuge in Medusa on a stormy night. I know its cottage well. It's the only shelter on the island. But... it is intact. If... among this public... no one is interested... Then, I would like to. We had to get away without delay. To discover an island... completely secure from the mainland. But, above all, secure from other islands. And we had to leave this time... Alone. This is my first task, to make a proper map of the island. To begin with, I place the board horizontally, then I orientate it with my compass and a level. Then I draw... a straight line. This line is from now on my reference point. You mustn't lose your orientation. And then I choose any point on the island. Anywhere. This is the starting point. The "zero" of the island. Once the map is completed, I have to find this "zero". This is what we call the "pathway". The "pathway"... But the 'pathway' is beautiful. Because we walk from one post to the next and we put the number of steps on the map. Provisions... Seed... A letter from Doucemer. I have prepared a list for you. Can you read my handwriting? - Yes, it's quite clear. That's all I want for next week. If there's something urgent, I can come sooner. No, nothing urgent. And in any case, in a week, I will already see the beginning of the map. The first lines. Do you have the list? The list? Ah yes... No, I haven't made one. Besides, I have a lot left. Almost half. Maybe you don't eat any more, or you just forget. Not at all. It's just that I eat when I'm hungry. Tell me... Last week, I brought you a letter. Yes... Why? No, nothing. I was wondering... but is there a reply? No. No, not really. But you know with the sun all day long, there are no hours of the day. Time no longer exists. Impossible to measure the length of the day. There is only the sun... Light... and then... Night. What do you think? When you started, I was wondering. I wondered if it was worth it. Now, yes, completely. Your island is no longer just a name. It exists for others in reality. From now on it can't be denied. No, that's not really why. If I was determined to make this map, it's to know where I am... on Medusa. Because there are times when I think that the ground I tread under my feet is merely imaginary, that it is attacked from all sides by the ocean... that little by little it is sinking into the sea. Now I know where I am. Anywhere on the island is found on this map. Anywhere that exists. I entrust this map to you. You have to take care of it. I promise. Besides, I can go by there on my way home. I can drop it off today. Drop it off where? But, in Doucemer. - That's no good. The addressee doesn't live there. Is that the addressee? After all that work? The National Geographic Institute? And there's only one copy! Yes... only one... And so? So what if one morning you wake up and find out that you have forgotten what your island was like? What shape it was? It could happen. In that case I'll close my eyes... and... I'll remember it. I shall remember it. I shall remember it. I shall remember it. To live with his whole being with the island. To be one with it. This was what he had been seeking since he left the North. And it was here, on Medusa, that he had finally found it. We received your map. Take a seat. You must excuse me, I'm not used to... seeing people here. It's strange... It's only now that I realize... that my house was always empty. But how did you carry it out? It can't have been easy. Yes, yes, it was easy. I went from one post to another by progression. I measured. I drew. And like this... until the end. How long did it take you exactly to do all this? I don't know. I don't know at all. Not even some idea? Weeks? Months? No. I can't know. I only remember sunsets. All the sunsets. But how many... I don't know. I was only surveying. counting my steps. I like your method very much. My method? What method? You know... I don't have a method. There is a lot of intuition in your work. A lot. In fact, we are guided by intuition. It helps us... and opens wide the doors to the imaginary. We know planets now disappeared for millions of years. But disappeared where? Into what space? How? Sometimes I think... about the Earth. About our Earth. Everything that exists has its opposite... and its negative replica. And right down to the neutron. So we can imagine an image of our Universe in negative or in positive. We imagine, for example, that a sunset... on our Earth must spread a cold light, almost blue... a crystalline blue. Moreover, it is preferable for us to know this replica only in our imagination and not otherwise. Because the day when our Earth meets its double, it will be the end. They will be immediately transformed into a great fireball, lost in space. And we also know that opposites always end up by meeting. It is unavoidable. Unavoidable. Come on... Come on! Peace reigned between him and the island, A complete peace. Until the day he received the first warning. The forces of nature were awakening and the island with them. They were in their resplendent nakedness and they were terrifying. These forces were unleashed on him without mercy. And for his part, he resolved to fight. It was an unequal contest. He had to leave. Leave Medusa. For that it was necessary to reach his sailboat in the open sea... with the help of his dinghy. He needed to... and still he needed to. But under the snow his island had already become unrecognizable. He was frightened of it. And redoubled his determination. He struggled and advanced step by step. Can you hear me? Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Deep down, he thought he was invincible. He also knew that life cannot stop all at once. That it was necessary to hold on... To last... To last... That's what he was thinking about. And it was on this that his survival depended. And that's what he told himself... over and over. Oh, just imagine... he'll be surprised. Surprised? I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? Yes, I do... I'm sure... that he was expecting us. But tell me Edouard, you said that he lived alone. I thought so. Look at this. Here. And here. It's quite clear. But hurry up. Hurry up.
