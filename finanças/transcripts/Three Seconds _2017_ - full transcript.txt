Davai Straighten the elbow and keep your hand steady. Let's go. Dad, I'm already tired. Why are we waiting for so long? Just in case. Let's do it again. Garanzhin? Do you want to replace Gomelskiy with Garanzhin? Vladimir Petrovich, by the way, created Lenigrad's Spartak team from scratch. - Listen, what are we doing? - Calm down. What suggestion do you have? Comrades, Gomelskiy is no special friend of mine But, he is the one who raised Soviet basketball team to the international level. We cannot forget thatâ¦ - ...because of one.. - Gennadiy Mikhailovich! We can't be defeated and you know it very well. The decision about Gomelskiy has been made by the top administration. Neither of us can change it at this point. How are you not getting this? About Garanzhin. Why about Garanzhin? Comrade Moiseev, admit it: By using your official powers, you are just trying to do your friend a favor - Yes, of course. - All right. You played in Leningrad together. That's understandable, comrades. You make it sound, as if a friendship is something bad. I am proud of our friendship. Well, it's the fact from your bio, Grigoriy Mitrophanovich... ...in fact? Gomelskiy is the God of all coaches. All of them want to play like him. Everybody wants to win and play like CSKA, absolutely everybody! But Garanzhin, he is not like the others. Look out! - You need more practice. - Dad, it's too far, I can't do it. Well, just try it. Try to throw the ball from here. Here you go, do it. Where are you going? From here, it means from here. He won't get it. - Wow! - Cool! Well done! Volodya! Hurry up! - Don't show them your temper! - Kseniya. The national team - it means traveling abroad. Traveling abroad means surgery for Shura. The deadline - 1 year. Then you'll be able to screw them if you want. I see: don't break the chairs, Don't talk bad about Brezhnev. - Listen, you know what... - I'm leaving. Ok, see you. Straighten your collar. All right. Go in, tell them - thank you, Shake hands, then you'll leave. That's all. - I see, Grisha. You think I'm an idiot? - Here. Vladimir Petrovich, National basketball team of the USSR needs the coach. We think, that you are the one. What do you think? Thank you. It's the great honor for me. I'll be able to accept your offer if... ...if you first accept a number of my proposals. - For example? - New methods. - What kind of methods? - Well, first of all, American methods. American methods. What's wrong with the Soviet ones? Gomelskiy, by the way, has developed some great methods. The players should be able to travel abroad and play with foreign teams. It's the first thing. It'll put them under additional stress. They work too hard now, They hardly even come home! Gennadiy Mikhailovich, sit down. Sorry. It's their job. - Where the money will come from? - I'm not the accountant. - Yeah. - I'd change some players. Gomelskiy was getting the team together, But you'd like to change it. In this case, you should take Gomelskiy back. Hey, you! Don't sleep, it's a big boy game. Paulauskas! Keep working! Don't forget the ball. Ready. The State Sports Committee already signed. - Sash. - I am ok. My hair turned gray because of you. I see that. Here is a list of team members. - What is this? - My team. Belov, Paulauskas... Belov, Paulauskas, it's ok. But who are the others? Soviet Union National Basketball Team, line up! Let's meet the team. Come on, let's go. Dear, athletes! Thank you for the great games, For winning For getting on each other's nerves. Thanks for putting up with me for a long time. I gave the part of my life to you, and I'll never regret it. From this point forward, you'll have a new coach. Vladimir Petrovich Garanzhin. I ask you to love him and don't complain. I wish you... ...new achievements, They brought him down. Good day. To whom how Unfortunately, yes. I've compiled a list of players. I apologize in advance, if any of you aren't on the list. Well, let our captain... ...to read it out loud Don't hold grudges. The others - see you tomorrow. Belov Alexander, Belov Sergei, Paulauskas Modest. Modestas, not Modest. When will you finally remember this? Should we send him back to Lithuania, ha? - It would be better. - I'm all for it. He has a good pass. - Edeshko Ivan. - It's me. Sakandelidze Zurab. Korkia Mishiko. Zhar, you're also here. - Serega! Go. - Alzhan Zharmukhamedov.. ...Kovalenko Sergey, Volnov Gennadiy... ...Boloshev Alexander, Dvorniy Ivan... ...Polivoda Anatoliy. Sashka, give him a pass! He has been a coach for just a few days, but he already made his new rules. Throw! When I play, all streets are empty in Lithuania. And they want him to replace me? Actually, when he plays, there is usually a day off in Belarus. Belov, Paulauskas, go! Congratulations. Mishiko, where is your speed? Don't allow him to outrun you! Don't worry... Look, we're winning. Sergey, you're open. Guys! Great job! But that's not exactly what I need. Vanya, don't try to beat them alone. Actually, you don't see and you don't hear each other at all. Sergey, focus on the team, Zhar and Sashka aren't involved in the game. - About the defense. - Vladimir Petrovich, don't scare us. I'll score anyway. Don't ruin the well-defined rules. I don't want to sit here. I want to score on my own. That's what I want! He gets closer to the hoop. Defenders follow him, but he goesâ¦ Powerfully up.... and scores - That's what I want. - That's's what we all want. Well done, Sergei. You were the best! - Sergey, how's your knee? - It's OK. Bring me some ice. Guys, attention! Well done! Great! We tore them to pieces! Thanks. Paulauskas. - Sanya. - Thanks. Korkiya. Taxi drivers earn more in Lithuania. Just let me know, and I'll get you a job at any taxi station. Ivan. Thanks. - Sakandelidze. - Thanks. Grisha? To Vladimir Petrovich! To his first international victory! - Hip-hip! - Hooray! Polivoda. Why are you hiding? - Take it. - Thanks. - Congratulations. - Thanks. Vladimir Petrovich! Thank you for letting me to join the team. What would I do without you, you're like a son to me. - My congratulations. - No reason. There is a reason. - Sashka, congrats. - Thanks, you too. Austrian doctors are waiting for your boy. I'll do my best to raise money for his treatment. - Also we do need to prepare all documents for traveling abroad. - I can't help you with this. Have to go to MFA. I'll think. Thank you, my friend, for helping. It's ok. - Are you ready? - No. When has that ever stopped us? Serega? What is the difference between Gomelskiy's style and yours? We just started working with national team. Gomelskiy started this red car and it goes pretty well, but the difference between us is a goal. For instance? Next year there's Olympics in Munich We have to beat the American Team. Vladimir Petrovich wants to say, That the training level of national teams is increasing and our national team will seriously train for Olympics. Mr. Garanzhin, Is that what you wanted to say? I mean that, there is no eternal Empires. I will be careful, because of Administration of USSR... He doesn't mean that. America hasn't lost a single game since 1936. - How're you going to win? - I wonder that too. Someday, America has to lose to someone. I thought, it is better if they lose to us. For America, at least, it won't be a shame. [Georgian song] America. It the same situation as if Mozambique would play hockey against us. They have got basketball rings in every alley. What should I do, Volodya? I'll be in trouble. It's me who invited the crazy coach. They'll not touch you, don't worry. - I was pleased to play with you. - Yes. Here... oops.. Here... - Here. - Well, I was not. Wake up, Vova! You destroyed my career. Of course committee will say: Â«Sure, let's play!Â». But Americans will beat us hard! You are psycho. Psycho! I want to sing a Lithuanian song. - Ðhh! - Let's go, Modya. [Singing in Lithuanian] They have a chance, they're on the top now. But their careers are short: One of them will hurt the knee, One of them will go off the rails . But now everything is fine. Grish, don't you feel it? - Bravo! - Bravo! I'm not finished! . - Sorry, I just don't get it. - You always don't get it! - What do you mean? - You, Russians! - You always do it out of spite. - What a nonsense, hÐ°? Don't like the way we sing! Don't like the way we live! Don't like? Are you going to beat Americans with them? Why do you bother us all the time? Why do you bug us? Am I bothering you? Am I bugging you? No, you're my friend. I feel like I'm suffocating,do you understand? I want to break free. Warm wind, nice people. Let's go back, ha? - I'm going to go training this evening. - What are you talking about? What kind of a man are you? Go. What the heck? - Good morning. - Hello. - Please,follow down the stairs. - Thanks. Down the stairs. - Take it, dear. Bless you. - Thanks. Thanks. This way, please. Please, come. Come this way. Your luggage will need to be inspected. Don't you recognize us? We're the Champions of Europe, nation's pride! - Look closely. - Ok. Look, it's Serega Belov. Sergey Aleksandrovich. Sorry, I have to check. Rules. Wait. Where did you get it? I bought it in Essen with my own money. Are you Comsomol leader of the team? What do you need the Bible for? You mean, that Bible has something written against Comsomol in it? - Let him pass. - Ok. Comrades, come, come, don't stay. Can you sign the card for my boy? Hello. There's only one piece of luggage on the table. My mother knits, my granny knits. I also can knit. And I can too. - For sale? - Why for sale? Hey, listen, they're gifts! For aunt Tamara, for Babur. Zurab, explain to him, we can't come back home with empty hands.. We have even worse customs, they're waiting for gifts. - Fine. What is this? - It is a belt. I love this country. They knew. - Soviet man doesn't like being cold. - Why do you need two of them? One'll be stolen. Should I get cold? It's a tonometer. - Come on. - Thanks. You may come. Fuck you... We've done. Come on, please. Vladimir Petrovich, one moment. Congrats. Thanks. Hockey players are smuggling stuff in, but they welcome them with an open arms. - What was it? - Has someone informed them? Dear Comsomol leader, Tell us, who do you pray to, so they would not be checking you?? If you want to say something- just tell. I'm just thinking. Only you and the coach did not have anything in your luggage at the customs. You have whistler blowers in Lithuania too, don't you? - There was none any until you came! - Really? - That is enough! - All right! That's it. Cool off! Everyone! If i hear it one more time, I will throw you out of this team! You will be good at replacing light bulbs. Since you won't need the ladder. Will they kick you out now? Volodya, why did you have to say something about Americans? Everyone knows, that it's not possible. That's why they are trying to get a revenge. You know, Ksenia, what is not possible today, will be possible later. What do you mean later? We only have one year! One! And after this no one will try to do surgery either here or in Europe. Mom, Dad. Don't argue We are not. Shura, I am sorry I don't have a present for you today. That's to the trust. It's all clear with you! I don't want to see you! Do you even understand that with your statements you put the honor of the country on the line! And you don't believe into the strength of the Soviet athletics? Don't twist my words. If I didn't believe into the strength of the Soviet athletics I would not be sitting here now. Why did not you check with us first? I thought that we are committed to the same cause. I thought so too. I got a visit from well known to us department. They opened criminal cases. The coach missed something, the coach allowed something to happen. The national Team is smuggling stuff in their luggage. - I can answer. - For this too? How about Modestos Feliksovich? You have flaming anti-soviet player on the team. He has relatives in Germany. Once he goes to Olympics, he won't return I had enough of this Paulauskas myself. He is all yours. But after the Olympics. Today there is no one to replace him. It is a big success to win Americans in basketball. No one will judge the winners. But the losers are always crucified. Take a seat. You do believe in Soviet Athletics, and what about the Soviet Medicine? We have the best doctors in the world, and you want to bring your child abroad for surgery. We do understand your point. But you have to understand that in order to take your son there, a lot needs to be settled. Things have to be arranged. You have to get serious help. Permit for leaving the country, permit for treatment. You also have to exchange the currency. Sergei Pavlovich, I agree with you. Vladimir Petrovich needs help. I can do it. Some one has to be near, who canâ¦ â¦give the right advice, offer help. I can help. - Well? - You won't believe it. Everyone there wished us a victory and looked lovingly in my eyes. - Ðh! - Ðh! What will your future orders be? You picked out the right word, Serezha I will give out my orders tomorrowâ¦ to come to practice at 9:00. Until then you can do what Gomelski tought you to do, And then you will do it my way. You became acting General overnight. Is everything clear? - Good bye. - Good bye. They will use your head to play with instead of the ball. And my head too. Thank you for this, friend. You are..! - Polyakova? - Present. - Surkova? - That's me - Kanares? - Present - Smirnova? - Here - Nikolaeva? - That's me -Sveshnikova - Sveshnikova? - That's me! - Vlasova? - Here. The first practice is tomorrow at 6:00 AM. Now we are resting. Don't leave the dorm building, - any questions? Sergei Vladimirovich, what about the free time, our personal life? No questions. Read books and play chess. Everyone. - Strict schedule. - That's for sure. Give me your bag. Sanya, marry me Right here? - Where is your medal? - It's in the bag. Let me see. Here. - How does it look? - Beautiful. Keep it. They won't allow me to get married for another five years at least. All of the girls in our team were told so. But we won't tell anyone. I don't have a dress. I will buy you one abroad. OK. - Sasha, what's the matter with you? - That's all right, Everything is fine. Be quiet. It will pass soon. Don't tell anyone, or they will not keep me on the team. Flight is a natural state of the basketball player Be free, fly Balance your body! Complete control! And now freeze in the air! That's all right, we'll keep on working. Keep up with the speed. Do it automatically. You won't have time to think on the court. You'll have to act! Act fast! - And even faster! - Ðuch! - Ouch! - Ouch! We are moving, moving! Listen, Vanya? - How many points do you score? - Not enough. - But when you assist someone with the pass, how many times do they score? - Almost every time. - Did you get it? - No. You will get it. Sergei, the practice is over. Tomorrow were are flying, It will take 20 hours to get to Brazil. - First game is on the day of arrival. - I will sleep on the plane. - The team is resting now. - That actually scares me. You planned to win against the Americans with this team. - Are you sure in yourself? - My first coach used to say: Â«When you are stuck, give the ball to Sergei. He knows what needs to be doneÂ». It is still like that. I score on average 30 points in the game. - Who else does it? - Nobody. That's right. Sergei. There will never be the whole team that has players only like you. I guess, you got lucky. - Everyone, take a seat! - Stop it! Go back! It is a night time. It 's obvious, that this is against the rules, You understand it! I am telling you! Soviet payer hit another player. He has to leave the court. He started first! Basketball is a gentleman's sport. Who is this bird? That's William Johnson, the General Secretary of FIBA Asses! Grisha, move out of the way. Judge, the player is down! Who is going to score now? Give an injection to Belov, give him something! We have to hold out! Need more time to pass! Corky, Edeshko, Volnov, you all go ahead! Alzhan, subs are in. - Subs in. - Sasha! Do you see, he switches them every 15 seconds. Is he a coach or a juggler? I see that they are handling it fine without us. Vanya, well done! Finally. I am here! Alzhan, here! - What is your vision, honestly - 0,-4. - Why did not you tell me that before? - I wanted to be recruited. I can't have this kind of vision acuity on the team player. Take a seat! Sashka! Volnov! Hurry! Vladimir Petrovich, why are you constantly distracting them? You don't give them an opportunity to concentrate! - Who plays like that? - ÐmÐµricans do! Vanya, look, Mishiko! We are working! Faster! Pass it around! Keep on going. - Victory! - Hurrah! We tore them up! We dug it up! I am coming back on the 30th. We will meet on the 31st of May at 10 AM right in front of the town hall, where they register the marriages I am returning on the 31st at 6:00 AM You will have enough time Wait, wait, I forgot Here, it's your wedding dress - That's your size, I had to smuggle it in - You are crazy Sveshnikova! - Are you planning to get married? - What am I, crazy? - Let's go! - Ciao - Which one? - What? - Which town hall? - Griboedovski town hall. Dad, we need new shelf Couple more months and we will take Shurka to surgeons. too many trophies. - Do you even understand what kind of money it is? - Genadi Mihailovich.. We need to be exposed to the American teams. Students, courtyard players, anyone. What is the purpose for our best players to play with American students? Today they are students, and tomorrow they are professional players. Our team needs to lose the fear. They have to believe that it is possible to win against Americans. You, yourself, don't believe in it, but you want them to believe in that. You have been playing in Europe Vladimir Petrovich, do you even know how to speak English? How do you do Now, everyone is watching you here. Tomorrow is our first game. So keep focused. Now everyone go to your rooms. Don't go outside. We need to rest. - Grigori Mitrofanovich. - Vladimir Petrovich. Can we at least take a walk around? Just around the block. We want to see what America is about. - I guess, you can go around the block. - Thank you. - Hey, take caviar with you. - Oh, yes, almost forgot. You are not strict enough. Americans keep their team at the military base prior to Olympics. - And what are you doing? - I have to show them my trust. That's it, now we need to sell the caviar. We did not bring it for nothing, right? - We have to find some kind of simple bar. - I don't know if we can. Yes, America, that's very disappointing. Ðh, see there, our colleagues. Exactly. Let's go? Hi there, where are you from? - We are from Russia. - Soviets, Soviets. - Soviets, Soviets. - Ðh, you are the communistsâ¦ Yes. Do you have the Indians in Russia too? - What? - He thinks, that you are an Indian. Do you want to play? - For money? - I pass on that. Yes, yes. Guys, we'll beat them up and that's it. - Are you going to play in your stupid boots? - So what? - Let's go back, to the hotel. - What, guys? Let's go, There is a game tomorrow, if we brake a bone. What are you doing? They play in one hoop, let's go - We better go to sleep. - We'll play for a short while. - Let's go. - Sorry. Clowns. Caviar? Come on, snowball, you start. . Today you will lose your money. Wow! Who is playing like that? Do you want to make a bet? Make a bet. Mishiko, how are you? Did you see how they did it? Hey, come over here Hello? Vladimir Petrovich, we need to perform urgent evacuation. They are on the 7th Avenue. Here we go. My dear, if you could only see, how the Yankies beat us up today Let's make a toast to the burial of the Soviet basketball! Hurrah! - What happened? - Just played a little with locals. They are not even students, just the street guys And? we lost. Dumb asses. All right, we are taking them out, taxi will take them to hotel. Hey, move out of the way! Wow! Guys, you are not the first and you won't be the last. It happened. But there is an opinion, that this was a provocation. And you played against professionals yesterday. It was a trap, let's say. To bring your spirit down. - Grigori Mitrofanovichâ¦ - Sanya. You can't underestimate cunning Americans. Why did he take it upon himself to be responsible for us? Did anybody ask if we wanted to be exposed like that? They will crush us today. And in Georgia it won't go well, Vladimir Petrovich promised it to us! You are the one, who got drunk yesterday at the bar Listen up! We'll lose to the students tooâ¦ They will start to pressure you across the entire court. Less dribbling and don't pass sideways across the court. - Volodya, we are in trouble. - Everything is OK. Vanya! Sasha, cover - Look at me! - Mishiko! Defense, defense! Vladimir Petrovich, do you have any corrections? Everything is OK. Here, here! Hey, right here! Come on! Are you all right? - Modestas, how are you? - Seva, I am fine. Zhar, let me see. Vladimir Petrovich, I'm sorry, what was that? I am sorry, but where was a coach during this game? Sanya? Seva, what's the matter with him? - And what are his chances? The disease is rare, unique Not more than 10 confirmed cases like that in the whole US. You understand that this is approximate. A year. Could be much longer And it could be also much less He needs at least a month of stabilizing treatments Medications Also the payments need to be settled All right Thank you There is an opinion, that physical exercise should not be stopped Heart muscle looses its elasticity in that case But there is also completely opposite opinion He is very sorry According to his rules, he has to tell the patient everything. I don't have the money For this We have our own medicine, and this expense was not forecasted When we return, we'll send him to Tuapse they will fix him up properly - He won't be able to even make it to Moscow - Vova, doctor did not say that! Let's do it like that, You pay here now, I will give you money in Moscow, from my personal funds. What personal funds? Can you even imagine how much does it cost? - And Shurka does not need a surgery? - Settled then. I will figure it out, as usual. If you say a word to anybody, I will kill you. Hello? - Hello, Ksenia? - Yes? Sasha is in trouble. You need to collect everything we have and bring it to the accounting office of the Sports committee room number 14. Don't worry about Shurka, I will think of something Please forgive me, that I did not tell you before. I would do the same, if I were you. We are both crazy. We have a ball instead of the head. All right, you have a rare disease. Unique one. No one knows how to treat it. No one knows how long you'll liveâ¦ â¦no one knows. Maybe a yearâ¦ â¦they might find a medicine for that. Please forgive me for being so upfront with you. It'll be hard for you to play without me, right? Sasha, you have to stop this talk. You are the Center in the USSR National Basketball Team . Listen to the coach's orders. Rest, read, and listen to the pleasant music. I will visit you every day. You will retell me what you read in the book and sing me what you listen to. - Did you get it, or I should repeat myself? - Yes, I got it. Go on. - Serega, how are you? - Vanya. - Do not go to the corners! - All right. Hold them back! Hang in there. I'm sorry, I have the same problem. - What is the name of this painkiller? - ÐK, I got it. - Sorry, what is that? - Take it. - Thank you very much. - Yes, yes. - Oh, no, that's too much. - Take it. No, thank you We have Analgin Everything is fine, we almost won. First we lost, then Belov, then we lost again It has been a bad year, very bad year - How is Sasha, will he come back soon? - He won't come back again until the end of the tournament Vladimir Petrovich, maybe he needs something? I'll tell you what he needs. Sasha Belov can't play, because he is in the hospital now And the best medicine for him is your victory. Is it all clear? University of San Francisco to the locker room Alzhan Why did not you pass the ball to anybody? Vladimir Petrovich. Let me leave the team on my own. Please don't tell anyone about my eyes, I can play in Tashkent's team, I will manage there Here, take it, it's contact lenses. You will put them right in your eyes. Soviet Union does not have it yet. This is the latest invention in medicine. Don't tell anyone Thank you very much. I am serving the Soviet Union! All right, most likely they will start to press you like that one - three - one This defense we will break like that. Modya! Let's go! Everyone is guarding the opponent player! Play for yourself and for Sashka! Play for him too! Pass it, pass! Pass here! - Sashka! - Sashka, look out the window! - Sanya! - Hey, Sasha! Sasha, Sasha! We did it! We won! - Sanya, come back! - Come back to us! We can do better with you! - Yes, Sashka 100%! - Come back to us! Get better! - Oh. - Now, scram! They will get us here now! - Get better! - Come out! OK! - Where did you come from, my knight? - From the plane. All right, we won't get married. We won't see each other again. Everything is over. - Sasha. - Things changed. - What changed? - Everything. - I am going. - What happened? Did I do something wrong? Do you have someone? Yes, I do have someone. And I always had. It's going to stay with me now, sorry. Sashaâ¦ Sasha? Let's go Not too good, guys Zurab, Mishiko, I need to see speed from you Take of the weights. Try to practice sprints Vladimir Petrovich, may Iâ¦ One more time, no weights. Mishiko, let's go! Come on, come on, speed it up, let's go! Sanya. - Why aren'y you taking a break? - It's all good, I am not tired. You will take a break every half hour for five minutes. Got it? - Finish up. - All right. Good. Good. Sprint! - That's it. - Vladimir Petrovich, one minute, please? - Shower - May I talk to you? - What is your time in one hundred meter distance? - 11,7. - Do you know thatâ¦ - That's too slow for you. - Volodya. - What? One minute of your time. That's too slow for you. I have seen Paulauskas before - Here he is - You know who gave it to me He contacted his relatives in Essen They organized the meeting between him and Euroleague Tell them that you could not reach me on the phone What is that suppose to mean? Where is Belov? Why are you lying to me? You don't have anyone except that weight bar. I have one year left to live. May be two. They gave me diagnosis in the States Sasha, go You need to believe. - Why are you lying to me? - Do you hear me at all? I have one year left, may be even one month! Do you want to become a widow? And you don't want to become anyone anymore! Sasha, I am not going to last forever either No one knows how long we have left What if someone tells you have 3 minutes left to live What are you going to do? And what if 3 seconds? And you? - I will do everything. - This is the answer of the Comsomol member. Sasha, right now we can do anything we want to do. Simply everything. And it does not matter how much each of us has left. You can do anything you want when you are alive. Here are the results of your experiments, Vladimir Petrovich. - Is it Paulauskas again? - It is Korkiya now. He wrote this. Zurab! We had a fight with him. He went to buy the tickets. Wedding. Let's go to the airport. Thank you. Why didn't you talk to me? Vladimir Petrovich I did try to talk to you more than once Can't you go for one day only? There is no weddings in Georgia that last one day. This is my sister who is getting married. Olympics happen every four years, and I have to live with my relatives for my lifetime. Forgive me. Do you have basketball courts there? Why? I know one Georgian old saying. Â«Gold is being tested by fire, woman is being tested by gold, man is being tested by womanÂ». Let's toast to the beautiful bride, the groom, - bride's great brotherâ¦ - Thank you. ...for this gorgeous land Vladimir Petrovich, this is our customs - Volodya. - And to our training session tomorrow. [speaking Georgian] - Bravo! - Bravo! Mishiko! What, uncle? - Mishiko, are you going to travel to Munich, right? - Yes, of course, I am traveling, why? You will meet my brother, Tariel there, he is in Israel's wrestling team. - And what? - You will give him this bottle of chacha Uncle, come on, Munich is a very big city I doubt I will be able to find him there. - Aren't you Georgian? - Of course, I am Georgian. One Georgian will always be able to find another Georgian. Hmm. All right. I had a dream on the plane that he is running around Everything will be all right. Sports committee is working on that. We will be in Munich, you go to the committee Pick up the documents to travel abroad. Find out what other papers we might need. Vladimir Petrovich, this our dream. Sun, good wine, our husbands are here. I am not sure how they will do. What time is the practice tomorrow? God's willing. Will 10:00 AM do? Head out. Keep together. Don't fall behind, very well! Breathe, breathe! Keep up with the speed! - Hello. - Mr. Garanzhin. How do you do. What do you think about the situation in Chili? on President Aliendo? No comments. Please. Ðh, no. - Don't be scared, Seva, you are one of us. - I should not Comrade Paulauskas. Soviet Lithuania is wishing you a victory. There is a bench in Olympic Park, the blue car will be waiting for you there every day. Hurrah! Cowards do not play hockey! What did he say? He said that you are walking funny. That's it guys, I can't. - It's enough pretending. You won the quarterfinals, that makes you all heroes. One more time, guys. Thank you all. Lights out in 1 hour. - Couple of words for our paper. - No, no. - Sergei - Seva, leave it out I need to visit some colleagues. Hungarians Seva should have more Should not do it without him You will die before he comes back! How does it look? It is in ampules. Modi? What? What is going on? Our doctor has different rank too. - I can't believe it. - Let's put it away. Do you understand? There are the girls I did not touch your stuff Look for rat between yourselves I have a different job I did not try to befriend you. If I wanted I had a chance to give you all up long time ago You are smuggling jeans, and currency And someone is a suspicious subject here Bastard! That's a shame, kind of friend. almost And our coach is tolerating him, although he could got rid of him a while ago. Our life would get better. But no, he is a saint. Saint? He needs to win, that's why he is tolerating us. I am not about this. Did you see his son? He was collecting money for his surgery. And when Sashka got sick in America, he gave all his money for his treatment. Sergei, think why would he do that? Cuban team is very well conditioned. Don't try to outrun them? Vova! Warm up. - Guys, attention. - Warm up! One minute. We have to play smart. To win and not to get exhausted . Because we have Americans ahead to play with. Cuba is our 17th Republic. Amigo! - Hello, Ksenia? - Volodya, forgive me. I inquired in the committee. they say, we don't have a permission to leave. It was checked over. Something about customs, about you Something that you are not trustworthy and you will lose to Americans We have to apply next year What about Shura? Where will we get the money? Ksenia? - Hello? - Hello? Comrades. What's the matter? We used to win against Cuba all the time before. What's happening? Relax, he has it under control. Guys, pull yourself together, don't give up. Not good, Volodya, not good. Behind by 8, Vladimir Petrovich Is it good enough for you? Vladimir Petrovich, what happened? Pass ball to Modi or me! Modestas, what's the score? 67:61 Who won? We did. What's wrong with you? Guys, thank you very much for your play. Rest now. Vladimir Petrovich, me and Zurab will go visit the Israeli team, all right? For a minute? Thank you. - Sasha Belov? - What? I need to check your blood pressure. Modestas, you are being watched. If you return to Moscow as Olympic Champion, they will leave you alone. Otherwise, they won't let you out again. What chances we have, I don't really know. You are strong team. But Americans are very good. If you planned something, you should do it now. Thank you, of course, butâ¦ â¦you needed this game so bad. You were killing yourself for this game, and us too. and now you say this, why? What is the most important thing in your life? Well, â¦home Lithuania Imagine if there is no more Lithuania. Would you still need this game? I see. Good bye. See you. What now, are you going to play against us? Let's try to avoid this, OK? Start the song about the motherland. My motherland is Lithuania, and not this yoursâ¦ My motherland is not âthis yoursâ either. My motherland is my mom and dad, Nashekovo village Basketball club and my friends Friends You are not taking to anyone. What kind of friends they are to you? They are great friends. That's me, who is a so-so friend Listen, I understand everything. We all had a thought like that. They pay moreâ¦ â¦and their balls are more bouncy. And they will fix my knees in one week. But I won't leave my guys Since when did they become your guys? Actually, for a long time I just finally got it. It is only Georgian, who was capable of thinking to bring bottle of chacha from to Kazbeg to Munich so he can give it to another Georgian. You know how uncle Iliko is - And how we are going to figure out it's him? - Listen,do you think it's possible not to recognize Georgian? For example, how do you recognize me? - Listen, I have known you for ages. - Well, we'll get to know him too. All right, wait. - Hello there. - How are you doing. Please excuse us, we are looking for the Israeli team coach He's Georgian. Sorry, can you speak English? Yes, yes. We have to give him this. Hmm.. Do you know his room number? [singing in Georgian] Ðh, you need room 202! Yes, two, zero, two Vovka, Vova! Palestinian terrorists attacked Israelis right in their dorms. They took hostages. I warned everyone, we are meeting in the hall. - I will go get Tereshenko. - Korkiya. Zurab? Zurab! Mishiko! Wait! Zurab! - Is everyone here? - Korkiya and Sakandalide are not here. And where is Paulauskas? You missed that defector. This team is not his property, as he thinks - This team is a face of the USSR! - The team did not go anywhere. It is still here and it's the strong team. Why are you defending him again? He will drag us down to the bottomâ¦ [speaking German] Until you get a political refugee status, no interviews. And don't contact anybody, they can approach you in disguise. Do you understand that this is not a sport anymore? This is a war! And we are on the frontline! And what are you going to show in Final game, nothing! Maybe we should not play? Seriously? We'll say that this is provocation, that we are for the honest sportsmanship and refuse to play under these circumstances? USA won't have a win, USSR won't lose. Grisha, you are a genius. Then I will call Moscow now. - Grisha , prepare the â¦ - Press conference. Yes! You, for example, Vladimir Petrovich, if you think, that everything is over for you, that's wrong. I promise you that. Do you mean everything? Everything was done in vain? Not at all, it's an opposite. Next Olympics will take place in 4 years. You are still the coach of this team. No one will take you down, I promise you that. You will bring us back the Gold. And during this 4 years we will help Shurkaâ¦ â¦everything will get better. This incident with Americans will be forgottenâ¦ ...and we will work on things. with no stress! To tell you the truth, this last year was like living with gun powder bag under my butt! Do you want the truth? I am the one who gave you up to the Customs. Ever since you mentioned winning against Americans in Essen. I thought, that you have lost your mind. and you will drag me down with you, But it was me who pushed you forward thru the ranks. We would lose to the States. And I would be kicked out of the Federation? You will have Spartak team to go back to. And what about me, Vova, what about me? That would be easier for you too. When you have something to lose. I wanted it to be like that! Will you forgive me? All right. Got scared, it happens. But now you took away our game from usâ¦ - You would have lost! - Maybe . But we lived for it for this past year. And you took this life andâ¦ many people trying to report on each otherâ¦ ...but you stole basketball from me and my guys Ðnd we have nothing else left. That's why, Grisha, you are a bastard. - Wait, one more timeâ¦ - You will tell this to the guys yourself. I will write the note on behalf of the basketball national Federation. We are voicing the protest and leaving the Olympic Village Terrorists were given the bus and two helicopters to the airport and from there, the plane to Cairo - Miss, please excuse us! - Excuse us, we need to get thru! We are athletes! We live here! Miss! Explain to him that we are not the palestinians! Guys, guys! We are the Soviet basketball players, let us thru! - ÐÐ¾rkiya? - Sako. Guys, where are you? - Did you get scared? - Did you think that we were in the room? - Where have you been? - We were in the city. - All right. - Once we found out, we came back. You, men! When we tried to return, they would not let us in. - Here? - Yes. Do you realize that we worried about you! Stop here. Olympic Village is there, Did you miss it already? I am not going. Come on, brother, pull yourself together! Everything is ready. Thank you brother, for everything. But no. It happens, Modestas, you got overwhelmed, let's go. Stop! You did not abandon me. So I won't abandon my guys either. Please forgive me, if anything As you can see, I did one step, but I can't keep going. He wants to go back Bye, guys How long since they became your friends? For quite a while, it took me too long to understand. That's all. We regret the loss. The games will be continued. Any delegation has the right not to participate. All hostages died. Are you here? For us to play in this type of situation would be a crime. Today at the press conference we will make an announcement. Gather your staff. So I came back for this? To become nobody. Guys, I think I got it all. Do you remember, when Sasha got sick, Money came not from the Basketball Federation Garanzhin's son is sick, you know. He was saving money for his surgery. And he gave all of it for Sasha Belov's treatment. Modya, they came after you. Garanzhin backed you up, saying them, that you are part of his team. Zhar, how many fingers am I holding up? Two. Those are the contact lenses he bought you, right? - Mishiko. - I understand everything, my friend. Nobody, except our coachâ¦ believed that we can play and win. - Even us? - Yes, even, us And he pushed and pulled us forward. We don't have to play. We won't get punished for that. Moiseev does not want us to play either. That is actually works for them now, so Garanzhin's team, that coach put his heart into, doesn't loose. But what will it make us? We need to find Moiseev. First thing I am going to talk about is a terror attack, condolences, etc. Then we will give the turn to speak to Moiseev to make an official announcement. - You will be agreeing with me. Clear on that? - Clear. And where is Moiseev? - You can start. - Thank you. Good afternoon, Ladies and Gentlemen. Our friends. We bring our deepest condolences for the victims of the terror attacks. You can refuse to see that, this is a provocation against the Soviet Union. Quiet. Soviet Union is not going to tolerate this kind of insultsâ¦ â¦addressed to us. - And that's whyâ¦ - I am sorry for being late. Where have you been? That's why we have made the decision, probably, the onlyâ¦ - right decision under the circumstancesâ¦ - To continue playing To play no matter what. Sport is more pure and beautiful than any type of war. Cold war or real war. This is an official Statement of the National Team of the Soviet Union. Yes, and one more thing. All of our players are feeling well. Thank you. Korkiya, Paulauskasâ¦ â¦and Sakandalidze. What did you say? Have you gone mad? You will be sent to manage the stock rooms in Irkutsk's local club. 120 rubles a month is your new pay grade. I think I can manage that. Tell, what made you come up with this decision? Vladimir Petrovich, Moscow is on hold for you. - Hello? - Dad, can you hear me? Shura. I can hear you. Forgive me, son. What for, Dad? Please win. - I will try. - What does it mean you will try? I bet 3 rubles on our win to the boys in the courtyard. I would have bet more, but I did not have more. I got you, son. We will get your money back. Thank you.
