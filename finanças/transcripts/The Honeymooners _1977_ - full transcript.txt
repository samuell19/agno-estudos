JOHNNY OLSON: From the beautiful Superstar Theater in the Resorts International Hotel on the Boardwalk in Atlantic City, Jackie Gleason presents-- [theme music] JOHNNY OLSON: --The Honeymooners, starring Jackie Gleason and Art Carney, Audrey Meadows and Jane Kean, with guest star Eileen Heckart. And away we go! [lively music] - That's a beautiful tree, Alice. And it's so big, too. - Yeah, isn't it a beauty? - Uh-huh. - I just bought it and I had to carry it all the way home myself. - You carried that home yourself? - Mm-hmm. - Why didn't you let Ralph buy the tree? - Oh, no, not Ralph. You know how he always wants to wait until the last minute so he can get one cheap. Don't you remember last year, he bought our Christmas tree on January 10th? Oh, I've got to think of some place to keep the tree cool so it won't dry out. - Why don't you put it on the fire escape? - No, I think I'll put it in the bedroom. It's colder in there than it is outside. - Well, It can't be as cold as our bedroom, let me tell you. Ed keeps that window open all night long. But I guess considering he works in the sewer all day, it's not such a bad idea. - Hey, I see you finished your Christmas shopping. - Oh, are you kidding? That's just about half of it. But luckily Ed gets paid today so I can finish it off tomorrow. How's yours coming along, huh? - Well, not too good. Ralph gets his check tomorrow. - Oh good. - Hey, Trix. Hey, Alice. I'm sure glad to see you in the spirit of the season, buying all those Christmas gifts, huh? - Oh, they're not Alice's. They're mine. - You nuts, Trixie, spending all that money? And another thing, Trixie. How many times do I have to tell you not to put fried chicken in my lunch box? - Now, just what is wrong with fried chicken? - When you work in the sewer, you don't want anything finger-licking good. - Alice, sweetie. Hi, Trix. Hi, Norton. - Hi, Ralph. - How'd everything go today, Ralph? - I wish you hadn't asked, Alice. On the very first stop, an old lady gets on the bus and her false teeth fall into my change box. By the time I got 'em out, I was bit three times. ALICE: Oh, well. Don't worry about it. Tomorrow will be a better day. - Yeah. Well, it's not going to be better tomorrow because tomorrow I'm driving a school bus. - Oh, sweetheart. Just try and forget what happened today and I'll fix you a nice meal. - Oh, Ed. I'm sorry. - What are you sorry about? - I forgot to buy something for your dinner. I'll have to go to the store. What do you think you feel like having tonight, Ed? Frozen fish sticks, frozen chicken pot pie, frozen lasagna or frozen stuffed peppers? - Folks, here's a case of true love. Here's a woman willing to risk frostbite just to feed me. I don't care. I don't know what I want to eat. - You want me to surprise you? - Yeah, make it a big surprise. Don't come back. - Oh, did you want me to cash your paycheck at the store? - You always remember, don't you? - You bet I do. - Oh no, not this check. No, they don't have that much money. This is a biggie, Trixie. - How much? - My Christmas bonus check with a lot of overtime, comes to a total of $418.79. - Oh! - I think I need a tax shelter. I think I'll probably pour some of my sewer money into liquid assets. - I'd better get to the store. - Oh, wait a minute, Trix. I'll go with you. - OK. - I won't be long, Ralph. - OK, Alice. Am I glad they're gone. RALPH: Why? - I've got something I've been dying to tell you, but I didn't want to mention it in front of Alice. - What is it? - I am going to be a millionaire. - You are? You don't want Alice to know, right? You probably got another woman, right, Ralph? I know, I know. She's probably stashed out in some cheap east side hotel now. I know the type, draped over a chaise lounge, looking at soap operas, eating German chocolate cake. You dog, you. I should have suspected it when you started growing that moustache. - Another woman? Are you crazy, Norton? I can't even afford Alice. I didn't want to say anything in front of her because women don't understand high finance. But I am going to give you an opportunity to invest in the greatest plan I have ever had in my life. - What's the plan? - I can't tell you. - You can't tell me? - No. I can't. You'll have to trust me. You trust me, don't you? - Ralph, how can you stand there and say such a thing? I've known you for over 30 years. You're my oldest friend. Of course I don't trust you. - Well, I trust you and that's why I'm lettin' you in on it. - Hey, Ralph. In the event that I should be foolish enough to enter into this little scheme of yours, how much it going to cost me? - Well, uh, I'd say about, uh, somewhere... well, in the neighborhood of $418.79. Are you in it with me? - Uh, Ralph, you're not going to believe this. I lost the check. I can't find it anywhere. - Look in your hat. - Look, uh, Ralph, I can't give you the check. I can't. Trixie'll hit me. You know she's got a terrific left hook. - Norton, sit down. I'm going to tell you something I've never told anyone else in my life. As you know, I was an only child, and as an only child, I was a lonely child. I always wanted to have a little brother to play with, to have a catch with, go roller skating with, play hopscotch, Ringolevio, Fox in the Bush, a little brother that I could beat up every now and then so I could put a little Band-Aid on his little bloody nose. But as fate would have it, I never had a little brother. - That's really sad, Ralph. - Uh, but I said to myself, if I can't have a real brother, I'll have an imaginary brother. And I used to lay awake at night thinking, what did I want my brother to be like? First of all, I'd have to have fun with him. I'd have to admire him. And most of all, he had to be someone I could depend on. - Huh. Tell me, Ralph, uh, what did your great imaginary brother look like? - Norton, he looked just exactly like you. - That's beautiful, Ralph. - So you see why I want to make you rich, little brother. - Yes, big brother. I'm glad you-- I'm glad you wanted a brother, not a sister, because high heels kill me. - Well, little brother, we missed a lot of games in our childhood but we're going to play a little game right now. - Oh, yeah? What's it called? - It's called "Hand Over the Check." - Hand Over the Check? I'll play that game. Let's see now. - Will you come on with the check? - Here you are, Ralph. - What's that? - I'm your imaginary brother. That's an imaginary check. - Does this mean that you're not giving me the check? - That's right, Ralph. That means I'm not giving you the check. Just do me one favor. Don't tell mom. - Is that your final word? - It certainly is. - All right, then I'm going to tell you something. It's true that I had an imaginary brother. And it's true I used to play games with him. But now I'm going to tell you the truth. He didn't look anything like you. - Didn't look like me? Well, what did my, uh, imaginary brother look like? - Ricardo Montalban of "Fantasy Island." - Well, maybe he'll give you the check. [knocking on door] - See who that is. - I hope it's Ricardo Montalban. Ralph, it's Alice's mother. - That's all I need. - Is that all you can say? Can't you say anything nice? - What do you want me to say, that you taught Pete Rose how to slide in head first? - You could say that 19 years ago, I gave you that icebox, and 14 years ago, I gave you that bureau. 11 years ago, I gave you this table. - Yes. And I could say that 20 years ago, you gave me a migraine that will outlast the table, the bureau, and the ice box. - Your migraines are punishment for your sins. I never get a migraine. - Of course not. You're a carrier. You heard of Typhoid Mary? You're Migraine Mildred. - Well, what are you two bums up to tonight? Are you going bowling or play cards, shoot pool, or go down to that silly little Raccoon Lodge of yours? - Now, wait a minute. You can insult me. That goes along with the marriage contract. But you're going too far when you insult an innocent bystander who happens to be a gentleman and a guest in my house. - That's right. I'm a gentleman and a guest in his house. - Aw, shut up. - She got a left hook? - I don't know, but watch out for her feet. I think she's into Kung Fu. - Where is Alice? That sweet young thing I remember saying to, 30 years ago, you will marry that bum Kramden over my dead body. - That's another promise you didn't keep. - 30 years she wasted on you. You never gave her anything. You didn't even give her a child. Oh, how I've longed to be a grandmother, to hold a baby on my knee, to take him for little walks in the park and show him off to the neighbors. I long to walk through that door and have Alice rush up to me and say, "Mama, I'm pregnant! I'm pregnant!" But every time I walk through the door, the only one who looks pregnant is you. - That's it. Out! Out! - I am not going until I see Alice. - Out! - Now, I want her to deposit this check for me. - I'll give it to her. What is it anyway? - It's my husband's three-month social security check. - Social security? How can he get social security? He never worked a day in his life. - Are you forgetting he was in show business? - Selling candy in a burlesque theater isn't show business. - He'd have been a big star if it hadn't been for that injury. - Haha! Some injury. Fell out of the balcony when Sally Rand dropped her fan. - All right, wise guy. Just don't forget to give Alice that check. - I won't forget. - Well, don't. - What do you want me to do, tie a string around my finger? - I got a better idea. Tie a rope around your neck. - That woman. - I'll tell you one thing about her. She-- she's nicer than Trixie's mother. - That woman drives me crazy. Now I forgot what I was talking about before she came in here. - You were trying to think of some way to get a hold of some-- some money for this great idea of yours that you won't tell anybody anything about. - Well, I might as well forget it. You won't give me the money. It's Christmas time. All my friends have the shorts. Let's face it, Norton. Nobody's going to walk through that door and hand me a check. Norton, I've got it! - Oh, no. No, no, no, Ralph. Not that check. Not the check from Lady Kung Fu with the flying feet. She'll track you down to the ends of the earth. You'll never sleep. She's already mad at you for not giving her a baby! - This idea is so good, I got to take the chance. - Ralph, uh, If you're willing to accept that check and, uh, suffer the consequences and everything to go along with it, I think that must be about the greatest idea in the whole wide world. - It's better than that. - Well, considering that, you can have my check, too, Ralph. - Little brother, we're going to be rich. - That's right, big brother, uh, but can we do something first? - Anything you say, little brother. - Can we trot over to the schoolyard and play a little potsy? [lively music] - Alice? - Yeah? - Oh, Alice, you won't believe what I've got to tell you. - Oh boy. You're never going to believe what I've got to tell you. - Oh OK, you first. You're the home team. - Well, I went to the bank today-- - Yeah? - --to take some money out for Christmas shopping. - Uh-huh? - I got to the window and the man said to me, "The account is closed." - What? - Ralph went to the bank first thing this morning and cleaned out everything, our entire life savings. - How much was it? - $248. - Well, there goes your condominium in Florida. - It's not funny, Trix. - Oh, I know, but wait'll you hear my story. You know that paycheck that Ed with the Christmas bonus, everything? - Yes. - He handed the entire thing over to Ralph for one of his crazy schemes. Oh, Alice, what are we going to do? - We'll kill 'em. And then we'll plead insanity for marrying them in the first place. [knocking on door] - Come in. - Oh, Trixie, aww. - Aw, mother. - Darling. How are you feeling, Alice? - Oh, mother, I feel awful. - Oh good, I hope it's morning sickness. - You can forget that. I'm not even talking to Ralph. - Before you were born, I wasn't talking to your father. Did-- did Ralph give you the check? - Check? What check? - Why, I gave him your father's social security check to deposit. - He never gave it to me. - Where is that bum? - If he's smart, he's in Argentina. - What have we here? The finals in the Miss America contest? - I'm not talking to you, Ed. - Are you alone? I'm never alone as long as I got my big brother. - Well, in about 10 minutes, you're going to be an only child. - Well, another rotten day. But it's good to be home with my loved one. - Ralph Kramden, you took our entire life savings. - And you took Ed's paycheck, too. - And you didn't deposit father's check. - All right. All right. You're all right. I did take your money, and I cashed in my own paycheck. And I borrowed on my insurance. And I cashed in my Raccoon pension fund. And I put all of that money together and invested it in the greatest idea I ever had in my life. - Oh, yeah? What was that? - Stand back. The answer is in this bag. - What are they? - Lottery tickets. - Lottery tickets? Do you mean to say you spent all that money on lottery tickets? - That's right. - And you thought Ralph was crazy. - I'll vouch for that. - He's as sane as I am. - I don't believe it. - And that isn't all. There's more. Norton, help me move the bureau. - Certainly. - Now, when I say heave, you ho. - Right. - Heave. - Heave. - Ahhh. I told you, ho. - I know, I know. OK. - Heave. - Whoa. - Heave. - Whup! Let me surveil the situation, please. Just a minute. I see now. Ralph, it comes to my mind at this moment that if we remove someone of the drawers from the bureau, the bureau's going to be much lighter and we can move it a lot easier. - Now and then you do come up with a good idea. - Thank you. - How can you be so dumb? - What'd I do? What, what? - Look where you put the drawers. - What's wrong with that? - You've got them on the end of the bureau. - Well, what's wrong with that? - If you want to make the bureau lighter, you got to spread them out. Heave! - Ho! - There they are. Our tickets to paradise. - Do you mean to stand there and tell me that you spent all our money, the Norton's money, and my father's check on those stupid lottery tickets? - That's right. And do you know why? Because the first prize is $1 million. One million big ones! And the more tickets you have, the more chances you have to win. I figured that out. Only somebody with my brains could make a million dollars in one day. Tell me someone else who could make a million dollars in one day. - With your brain? - Yes. - I'll name one: Seattle Slew. - Alice, Seattle Slew? Were you comparing Ralph with a horse? - Only part of a horse. - All right. Go ahead. Make fun of me. But there's more than scientific fact to this. There is also the finger of fate. - Look out, Alice. I'm going to Kung Fu him right in the labanz. - Now wait. Just settle down. I'm going to tell you the most amazing story you have ever heard. - I can hardly wait. - Four weeks ago... four weeks ago, my bus breaks down in front of a gypsy tea room. Well, I go inside to make a phone call to the depot and I look through the beaded curtains and there's an old gypsy lady reading tea leaves. Well, as I get the dime out of my pocket to make the call, my rabbit's foot falls on the floor. She picks it up, presses it to her lips, and mumbles something. I said, "What are you doing with my rabbit's foot?" She says, "I'm putting a blessing on it. You will have good fortune for the rest of your life." Well, as I'm making the phone call, she starts to read my palm. She says, "Happiness is on the way. Your money line is very strong, and your lucky number keeps popping up all the time." Naturally I said, "What is my lucky number?" She says, "That's a dollar extra." So I gave her the buck. She says, "Your lucky number is number four." Well, I think nothing of it at the time. I go back to the depot and Garrett, he says to me, "Kramden, we're switching you to the 4th Avenue line." Now, you know I have never driven the 4th Avenue line. And I'm going along on the run, the first stop is 4th Street. You're not going to believe this, but four men got on. And get a load of this. They didn't get off till 44th Street. I go back to the depot and I punch out. It's exactly 4 o'clock. But like all great scientists, I want to give it one more test. I go back to the gypsy tea room and there's a cop there padlocking the door. And I said, "Where is the gypsy lady?" He says, "We evicted her four hours ago." I said, "For what?" He said, "She hadn't paid her rent in four months." Need I say more? - Uh, Trixie. You said I was crazy to give Ralph the money. - What has your short story got to do with the tickets? - Every one of these tickets had the number four on it someplace. Number four, my lucky number. - Mm-hmm. Your number is four, all right, Ralph. Because pretty soon, a little wagon is going to pull up right out front, a little wagon with four bells on it. Then there are going to be four knocks on this door. And we're going to open it and there are going to be four men there in white. And they're going to come in, and two of them are going to grab you by the arms, and two of them are going to grab you by the legs. And then they're going to say those four magic words, Ralph, just four words: "And away we go!" - Alice, are you trying to say that I'm crazy? - Well, it might be a good idea to have your head examined. - To have my head examined? Let 'em examine my head. Let them bring in doctors from all over the world, from Europe, from Venice. Let them examine my head! They'll find nothing in there! [lively music] What is your mother doin' in that bathroom?! She's been in there for an hour and a half! - She's only doing what every woman does before she goes to bed at night. She is putting on her beauty cream. - Beauty cream? Let her put on some vanishing cream and disappear. - Will you be quiet? She'll hear you. You've already got her so upset. That's why I asked her to stay. - I've got her upset? On account of her, I can't even going in and put on my pajamas. And on top of that, I got to sleep in the kitchen. - Well, why are you so anxious to get in the bathroom anyhow? You were in there ahead of her. - Well, I left something in there. - What? - My lucky rabbit's foot. - Oh, why are you so concerned with that silly rabbit's foot? - Because, Alice, I know you and your mother and your Irish wishes. She's probably in there right now putting an Irish wish on my rabbit's foot. - Don't worry about that, Ralph, because our wishes don't always come true. When I was a little girl, I had a wish. I wanted to become a nun and take a vow of poverty. Instead, I married you and took a vow of poverty. - Now, look, Alice. You go in there and tell your mother to give me my rabbit's foot. - I will tell her nothing, Ralph Kramden. Good night! - Haha, you dirty ol'-- Aargh! If you're going to walk around like that, wear a cowbell around your neck! - Here's your rabbit's foot, Ralph. And you know what you can do with it. - Ugh. [knocking on window] [knocking on window] - Norton! What are you doin' out there? - I'm almost frozen to a crisp. Trixie locked me out there on the fire escape. - She's locked you out on the fire escape? What? - Locked me out. - Why? - Oh, I was upstairs, just minding my own business, having my little snack before I go to bed. She got me out there on a very clever ruse. She says, "Ed, go out there on the fire escape and water the petunias." So I got out there. After I get out there, I realize, you don't water petunias in the winter time. And second of all, I realized we don't have no petunias. So I hollered back in a very authoritative way, I said, "Trixie! Open up this here window." And she said, "Not on your life. No way." Here I am. I'm f-- I'm very sorry, Ralph. Can I spend the night with you here? - Under no conditions. Go to a hotel. - I can't, Ralph, you took my check. - All right. You can stay. - Thank you. Thank you very much, Ralph. Uh, before you go to sleep, uh, you mind if I finish my snack? - Go ahead, but I'm going to bed. - Yeah, alright. - Good night. - Thank you very much, Ralph. Hey, Ralph? - Huh? - You have any mustard? Hey, Ralph? Have any ketchup? - Now. You have your mustard. You have your ketchup. Is there anything else you want, like sauerkraut, bread and butter pickles, sour cream, soy sauce? - No, Ralph. This sandwich is just perfect. Thank you very much. - Good night. - Good night. Hey, Ralph. Got a bottle of Moxie I can drink with my sandwich? - Put that sandwich down and get in this bed! [loud throat clearing] - What are you doing? - I'm very restless. I can't sleep. - Well, try counting sheep. - Good idea. One. Two. Three. Four. No, that's a sheepdog. - Get out of the bed! Get out of the bed. - All right, you don't mind if I finish my snack, do you? - Norton, I want to ask you a simple question. - What is that? - How do you get to sleep when you're upstairs? - Oh, upstairs, that's easy. Trixie rubs my back. - Well, I'm not rubbing your back. - Well, if you don't, I'll probably thrash around all night. - All right. I'll rub your back. - Thank you. - Are you gettin' sleepy? - No. Forgot to tell you something. When Trixie rubs my back, she also sings our song. - Your song? - "Last Time I Saw Paris." Reminds us of where we met. - You met Trixie in Paris? - We met in Newark but there's no songs about Newark so "The Last Time I Saw Paris" reminds us that we met in Newark. - That reminds me of my song. - What's that? - "Help Me Make It Through The Night." All right. I'm going to rub your back and I'm gonna sing to you, but if you ever tell anybody at the Raccoon Lodge about this, it'll be the last time you'll see Brooklyn. - Of course I won't. - The last time I saw Paris, her heart was bright and gay. - Do-wah, do-wah. - The last time I saw Paris, her heart was bright and gay. - Just as I thought. I'm calling Anita Bryant the first thing in the morning. - That did it. Everybody's against me. Alice is against me. Her mother's against me. Trixie's against me. You're against me. All I have left is my rabbit's foot. Where's my rabbit's foot? It was laying there right alongside of your sandwich. [loud burp] [theme music] - Hurry it up! I got the champagne. - I got the radio. - Good stuff, too, $1.99 a bottle. Right here on the label, look. See? Bottled in Jersey City. I'm telling you. When it comes to champagne, I am a conny-seur. - Well, in just about another 10 minutes, they are going to have the lottery program on and I'll win a million dollars. A million dollars. You know what I was thinking? I think I'll move to Park Avenue, rub elbows with Nelson Rockefeller, Jackie Onassis, Hugh Hefner, Stanley Kapinski. - Who's Stanley Kapinski? - He won the lottery last week. Well, I see we have more good news. Your mother's leaving. - She's leaving, and I'm leaving, Ralph. I'm going to my mother's for a few days to think things over and I may not be back. - What are you talkin' about? - Hey, Ralph, uh, if she don't come back, can I moving to Park Avenue with you? - You're the one. You're the one who's talking Alice into leaving me, you bat. - I take that from whence it comes. - Take this from whence it comes. - Ralph. - Sounds like a family fight. I think I'll leave. - You can't leave me. You can't leave me. I'll go crazy if you leave me. I won't let you leave me. - All right, Ralph. I'll stay. - Not you, you idiot! I'm talkin' to Alice. Look, Alice, I don't want the money for myself, I want it for you. Think of what we could do with a million dollars. All crazy romantic things, go on a second honeymoon to Atlantic City. Check in to the finest hotel. Check into the finest hotel and get the best room they have, the one that overlooks the platform where Daisy the Diving Horse jumps off. And Alice, you're going to have something you wanted for a long time but could never afford. You're going to have that wart removed from in back of your knee. - That's just enough of your pretty speeches, Ralph Kramden. And that is not a wart on Alice's knee. It's a beauty spot. It runs in our family. I have two: one on my knee, and one in a spot that only my husband has seen. - If your husband has seen it, there must be a wart under the table at Kelly's Saloon. - Come on, Ralph. Come on. Enough of this talk about warts. Let's listen to the lottery awards-- - Let's turn the radio on. - Going to be on in a couple of seconds. - Never mind. - Nothing's happening. - Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Have no fear, Norton's here. I used to be an electronic second mate in the Navy. Let me check this out here. Yeah, there's your trouble. See that wire there? - Yeah. - See the slot next to it? - Yes. - You gotta push the wire right into the slot and hold your finger on it. Go ahead. Into the slot and hold your finger on it. Make sure the volume's on. - Right. - Still not working. - Plug it in, dumbhead. - The volume on? - The volume's on. - You put your finger on the wire yet? - I got it. Will you plug it in? - All right, here goes. [loud buzzing] - Aargh! Aargh! Aargh! How can you be so dumb? - I'm not so dumb. I didn't say plug it in. - Now, I haven't even got a radio to listen to the lottery. - Have no fear, Norton's still here. Wait a minute. Hold the phone. Trixie! - What do you want? - Bring down my radio. The one that's shaped like a cat. - He would have a radio shaped like a cat. I'm nervous, I tell you. I've never been this nervous in my life. If I only had my rabbit's foot. I wish you had it too. [burp] [lively music] - Where is she, Norton? Where is Trixie with the radio? I'm going to miss the program. - There is-- there is-- - Give me that. - Did you see what he did, Ed? - Yeah, I saw that. Watch it, will you, Ralph? That radio cost me 15 bucks. - Thanks, Sir Galahad. - How do you turn her on? - I usually bite her ear. - Not Trixie. The cat. - Oh, the cat. Very simple. You see, the left eye, that's the volume, turns the radio on also. Here, you get the stations this way, see. Now if you want police calls, you just twist the whiskers like this, see? You know, in case at night, if you're restless, and you want to hear some short wave, Paris this up, Australia is down. - Will you just get the station on it? - Oh, all right, all right. Let me see. It's a very delicate thing. That's it. I got it. I got it. RADIO ANNOUNCER: And this concludes the Sunshine Hour. Next, we bring you a public service program, the announcement of the winners of the annual Christmas lottery. We take you to the state capital where the winners will be announced by that famous TV personality, Johnny Olson. He-- he-- here's Johnny! JOHNNY OLSON: Good evening friends. It's a pleasure to be here, but I know you're anxious to hear the names of the winners so let's get down to business. I will first announce the three major winners. Will you spin the giant tumbler, Penny? - Did you hear that? The giant tumbler. What chance would I have had if I bought one ticket? I should have cashed in your insurance, too. JOHNNY OLSON: And now, the winner of the million dollars first prize is-- it's a Mr. Ralph-- I'm having trouble reading the last name. - It's me, Johnny. I'm a lousy writer. JOHNNY OLSON: Is that first letter a K or an H? - It's a K! JOHNNY OLSON: Yes, it's a K! I've got the name now, and the winner of the million dollars first prize is Mr. Ralph Krausmyer. - I don't believe it. JOHNNY OLSON: Mr. Krausmyer's winning number is 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 5. - Hey, Ralph. All them 5s. He must have seen the gypsy lady right after you. JOHNNY OLSON: The winner of the $500,000 second prize is... Mr. Pete McGovern of Nome, Alaska. - How you like that? An Irish Eskimo wins and you get nothing. Probably came down in a canoe, bought one ticket, and now he's back in his igloo. JOHNNY OLSON: And now, for the third and final grand prize, $100,000, the winner is... Marion Owen of Ocean Park, New Jersey. - I am dead. - Bye. - Well, big mouth, you lost. And don't forget I told you so. - And I told you so. - And I'm also telling you. And I'm no longer your little brother. Go back to Ricardo Montalban. I'll go to the gypsy and get another brother. - I'm not a vicious woman who holds a grudge, Ralph. I just have this to say. You were a bum when I met you and you are still a bum. - And you'll still be a bum 10 years from now. - Congratulations, Ralph. - What are you, a wise guy, trying to rub it in? - No, I left the radio on when I walked upstairs. You won something. - I won something? - Yes. - What'd I win? - You won sixth prize. - Sixth p-- I won sixth prize. - He won sixth prize. - Wait a minute! What-- how much did I win? - $1,500. - $1,500! Alice, this is the first time I've ever seen you speechless with joy. Well, the party's on me. I'm taking everybody to the Hong Kong Gardens for Chinese food. - Thattaboy, Ralph. Chinese. Can I order from column A and column B? - You can have anything you want. - Beautiful. All right, Trix. Let's go home. I'll get a little romantic music on the cat. We'll sip some champagne, and who knows what may develop before we reach the dark at the top of the stairs? - Ah, so! - Ralph Kramden, you should be ashamed of yourself. - Ashamed? Why? - That's right, why? How dare you insult my favorite son-in-law. - You, uh, listen. You had your head to the keyhole and you were listening. - I didn't hear a thing, Ralph. I was just thinking over how mean I've been to you. I swear, I didn't hear a thing. When we get to the Chinese restaurant, I'd like to have wonton soup and sweet and sour pork, and spare ribs with, uh, with bamboo shoots. I'll run ahead and get a table. And Alice, you be sure that Ralph bundles up. I don't want Ralphie baby to catch a little cold. - You know, your mother's not a bad skate at that. I think she loves me. But everybody loves a winner. - You won $1,500. How much did it cost you? - I know exactly what it cost me. Let's see. The first day I bought 300 tickets, six, four, three into 10. Then I had 100 tickets the next day. That's right. And I had to get the big envelopes, put the tickets in. That was [mumbles]. Then I had the rubber bands to put around the tickets. And then I bought the clips to p-- $1,499.88. - You won $0.12. - I won. I won $0.12. I was almost a millionaire. I'm a winner, Alice, a winner. - You think you're a winner, Ralph? - Yeah, I think I'm a winner. - You really think you're a winner? - Yeah. - Well, I think you're a loser, Ralph. You may have won money but you lost things far more valuable than money. You lost the trust and the respect of your best friends. Like Norton. You took his check and you deceived him. You deceived your best friend. And I know you don't like my mother, but you had no right to cash my father's check. And what about me, Ralph? Did you give one single little thought to me? You took your paycheck. Oh, I know you earned it. But then I thought you and I were supposed to share things. And then Ralph you even borrowed on our insurance money. I don't know how you could do such a thing, Ralph. And you think you're a winner? Well, I don't think that you're a winner, Ralph. [sad music] - All right, Alice. Let's face it. I'm a moax. I continually do things that are crazy. I embarrass you. I cheat my friends. I do everything wrong. But I only do it for one reason, Alice. I do it because I love you. I'm nuts about you, Alice. I've always been nuts about you. Alice, if I promise never to do any more crazy things, will you please stay with me? - I must be crazy, too, Ralph, because I still love you. - Baby, you're the greatest. [lively music] - Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. How sweet it is! All I know, I used to come to Atlantic City for saltwater taffy, cut to fit the kisser. But from now on, I'm coming to Atlantic City for friendship. It's the greatest. Now, I know you want to meet our cast once again, and first I would like to introduce a young lady who was appearing with us for the first time and she certainly is a doozy. One of the finest actresses we've worked with ever, Miss Eileen Heckart. Eileen? And Jane Kean! Audrey Meadows! And Art Carney! Good night, everybody.
