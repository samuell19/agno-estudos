Yes or no, snookums? Yes or no what? Well, I'm putting together the list! The list? What list? You know, the bridal list! White dress, ring, orange blossom… No! You can see that I'm busy with… He's in the grand entrance hall. Two more minutes to rehearse, then it's showtime for you. Hello, sir. Remember what I said yesterday. Hello, Mr. Grofenol. At ease! And then, the boss arrives - like an idiot… - Ah! You. I saw your quote. Are you nuts? 3,500 francs for four sorry bit players, seven metres of moth-eaten carpet, a barren buffet? Too steep for a minister! Oh, sir, sir… As penalty, you're being reassigned. This place is out of control. Oh, sir, but I… Great. Phone! Ah, you two… Is the kangaroo movie ready? - Yes. - Yes, sir. Good. Screening in five minutes, in my office. Attention! What do we have here? She's the temp, for when I'm on holiday. Holiday? Holiday? Do I look like a charity to you? I sell holidays. I don't give them away. Get out! It's hot… Ah! Finally… Let's go, quickly. This film… Is it ready yet? Okay, lights off. Wait a minute, wait! Is this what you call kangaroos? A small error, sir. No problem. There we go… My kangaroos… So there you have it! We're pleased to tell you that 5,000 of these kangaroos will soon travel to the USA. Yeah! The Sitting Company told us before your arrival. And Mr. Sitting himself will come to sign in September. And bring us lots of dollars. Well that's 200 million in profits. With that, we can clean up the mess and start fresh. What is this? I said I didn't want… Ah, okay… Ah, the samples… Let's have a look… But I'm not done with you! No, quite the opposite. Ah yes, here… During the bookkeeping of 1968, that you for once took care of, there's a sort of little pinhole. Oh, just a little snag, sir. A little snag? You call that a little snag? 32,788,223 francs, you call that a little snag? I call that a laceration. I call that an historic collapse. So, it's your choice: I either fire you in spectacular fashion, or I kick you out with a smile. And jail on top of that. But wait a minute! The collective agreement! We've three months' notice, as executives. Three months? Sold. But I warn you: during these three months, it'll be slavery. I want you on the ground, at my feet, like dogs! Down boys! These mangy beasts! All right, time to get to work. You know, I'd try playing kangaroo on the patio. Get! Why are you laughing? Nothing funny about being broke. Forget your empty pockets. I'm going on the offense. Mission: Hector. And tomorrow you can dust off your mourning suit. All right, go! This time we won't miss. So it's starting again, huh? But I haven't forgotten. 1954. The acid bath scheme. The belly. 1960. The rat trap caravan. That one… I've still got scars from. 1966. The cyanide oxygen mask. Down the toilet! Are you done breaking my spirit? This time, we win or go to jail. Hmm-mm… Stop. Jacket. Helmet. Glasses. Ladder. - Amazing! - Go, boss, go! Higher! Yahoo! Go boss, higher! Hey! Heyo! Bravo, bravo! Your form is Olympics-level! You'll see, things will be much better. Hey, hey! Hey, boss! Go for it, boss! Come on! Yes, come on! Try this one, it's better! Yes, boss! He was too old to be an astronaut. "To our beloved boss…" No, this one is better. "See you soon, Hector." Goodbye, Hector! Ah but watch out! Now, there's the second round. After the legal timeframe, the council elects us. The company is ours! We've waited 13 years for this! It's too good! Hope there's no catch. - Don't worry! - Listen… - No heirs at least? - My sources are good. Even so, I'm still a little anxious. First off, he's not 100% dead. The hearse in front of the clinic doesn't lie. And miracles don't exist, right? Your pessimism is out of line. Never been glad to work Saturday. It's a funeral… Voilà! I hope there's enough? No but tell me… Have you no sense of decency? Come on! - Oh, please! - No but really! I mean… Yes… Gloria! Gloria! Ah, there you are! What are you doing up there? Oh, crap! I'm totally blind in these glasses! Write it for me! Stuck inside with these clown clothes. Clown clothes, huh? You wanted a white dress, you got it! You wanted to live with me, now you live with me. Nonetheless, if someone told me Gloria Bikini would end up a woman in white… Ah, my dear… Saving face comes first. A CEO must be an example of virtue and morals. Ah! I could write books about your morals. - Speaking of… - Yes? When are you making it official? Ah no, too soon… No, for now, you're my medical alibi. And to announce my imminent death, a nurse is more useful than a wife. Gentlemen, please, gentlemen! Please, gentlemen! Listen to me. After all, we were like family. Those two creeps nearly killed me. But I have no proof. If they find out I'm back on my feet, they won't miss again. But if I play dead, they wouldn't dare chop up my corpse. Please, tell me what our grump would have wanted. Just watch, I'll take them for a ride day after day. I'll play The Agony of the Eagles in the morning. I'll play the death of Hector at night and Volpone all the time. Don't move. There's a ton in there! And to think, all this started with cavemen. Sure, great, pass me the mic. Guillaume, Eugène! Report straight away! You know what messing this up is? A crime. There's nothing we can do, he's hardy. It's the tragedy of the gerontocracy. Let's try to fix this and finish the job. But… with class… and with discretion. Madame nurse? - It's us, the directors of… - Yes, I know. Mr. Hector asks for you whenever he's awake. How is our little miracle? What a surprise that he came back out of the blue. Oh yes! He wanted to die in his dear home. - Oh we understand him… - Come in. But just for a minute. Any small thing could kill him. Perfect, perfect… Perfect. It already looks like a funeral home. That's good for us. Boo! Did we scare you? It's you, my good friends… Come closer, closer… You know I am… I'm going to die. He's already gone. I can't see you well… My good companions… I know I've done you wrong. I know. If, if… I bullied you, I insulted you. Even just now. You, who embody loyalty. I can see that on your faces. I'm suffering… Listen… Listen… Promise me… to take care of the factory… the minister… the Sitting contract, the kangaroos… Everything is in your hands. I feel… I feel… that it's the end… I knew that I still had it. - Yeah, but I'm still nervous. - Why? I mean, we got him. I won't calm down until we're next to his coffin. Nothing corrects style like a wedding ring. Oh no, this again? Oh, it's my little Boule. Do I look agonizing enough like this? Yes. So you put on a show for her too? Of course, kid. For everyone! One slip and it's all done for. Go ahead, let her in. I want to be sure he's not messing with us. Ah, if my mother could see me… Oh well that, for instance… Miss Boule. I called you here… to give you a sensitive mission… a secret one. For obvious reasons, I can no longer run my factory. So I've decided to send you to Provence, to Cazalan, to find my cousin Achille. Achille… Yes, Achille, is a… He's one of those darned intellectuals, a professor of something or other… We used to be partners. We shared 50-50 ownership of the factory, and then I managed to… well, he… …decided to leave me everything. Now… he prefers being poor in Provence to being rich in Paris. Yes, in any case, he's a Grofenol. He's the main one. He's the only relative I have. Oh, it's… there it is… It's definitely happening tonight. When should I leave? Leave? Well, listen, take a flight tomorrow at noon. Go quickly, now. Go prepare your things. It might be that I never see you again. This isn't a joke. Will we lose our Hector? - Did you get that down? - No kidding! Now we just need to get ahead of it. Quick, the wheel! Hurry up! There it is, Cazalan! Without the castle, it's Melun. Turn right. Read me his pedigree again. His pedigree? Got it here. Grofenol Achille, 5.3.27, Nickname Grof. 175 cm, 78 kg… I didn't ask his shirt size! Sorry, sorry. Distinguishing mark: business incompetence. Ah, that's good for us. Oh yeah? Why? He doesn't have the gift, we do. We get him to sign before Ms Boule arrives. - Sign what? - Oh, just a little something… A little gift from the heir, his factory… You're not bad, you know? Well jeez… There must be a door! There has to be! There's going to be a drawbridge. Will you look at this crazy entrance? - No! - It's not possible… - Mr. Achille? - Grofenol? Let me handle it. I'll talk to him in the native tongue. Hey! Come here! Come on! Country folk sure have changed… You could use a little refresher. Are you Mr. Grofenol? You could have knocked, you know. It's no laughing matter, sir! Death is not funny. Your cousin… Mr. Hector is dead. Ah, 20 minutes he's been in this state. Announcing his cousin's death and the inheritance early is indelicate. Forgive me, I'm a sensitive guy. And poor Hector… He told you about me before he died? After jumping from eight stories, one isn't very chatty. Dead, he doesn't talk much. So, seems you've got a big deal going on here. I can't say it's a big deal. It's pretty modest, you know. I distill liquors from herbs. Come here, you. I use rosemary, sage, lavender. Come! - Come! - Come in, gentlemen. Come in. Hey, this stuff isn't too bad! That's nice of you, we don't smoke in here. Dear Mr. Grofenol, we've thought of everything. You don't need to leave this sky, sunshine, cicadas, to lock yourself up in a repulsive city. Unburden yourself. That's what I'm here for. Right? And we want to save you the tiring journey. So, one signature… Just a small annoyance, and done! Goodbye, problems. A piece of paper? Yes, you know what they say, a little autograph. You'll have another little drink for your throat? No, after the signature. Say, sir… - You know how to sign, right? - No. I mean… I can't. - Oh yeah? Why not? - Well because… Like my grandmother always said, "slow and steady wins the race". Well, your grandmother wasn't in business. Mr. Grofenol! We've thought about it. You're right. You should come to Paris. Why live among these animals? What an idea, for someone like you to rot here! Well you know, the view here is breathtaking. And it's not polluted yet. But you know what Paris is? It's paradise. It's businesses, consortiums, buildings, millions of offices… Ah, the offices! And the banks? You know what banks are? Balance sheets, profits, stocks, foreign exchange, trade… Life! The stock market… Stocks or life! Life! You know what the stock market is? The Grofenol accounts, plus three, plus four, plus five! All this is yours, it belongs to you! You're very kind. But you know… Excuse me. Your nonsense, it doesn't interest me. Mr. Grofenol! Mr. Grofenol! Say, Mr. Grofenol, if you won't come, your 320 employees will be out of work. Shivering and hungry! And you'll lose a deal worth 500 million. Oh, money… Money… 500 million? Yes, yes! No. And will I get Hector's big office? You're the boss. No, I can't. But wait, why not? Why? Because I have my sheep, I have my dog Romulus… Are you Mr. Achille Grofenol? No. He left. Where? Down there, up there. - He left? - Well, look… Well, how about that… Hello! Gloria! They kidnapped my cousin! It's big, it's important. Oh, yeah, I like it. Hello! Come on, Mr. Eugène. Come, come! Oh the pretty little sheep! Mr. Achille's good boy! Come on! Come, come! Crap! Dirty mutton! So what? What are you laughing at? Don't touch. Ah, gentlemen, may I? What is this? Mr. Hector, Mr. Hector! Listen… - We've got a surprise for you. - A surprise? If it's about Achille, it's not that much of a surprise. - Well, we thought… - You thought what? That it would make me happy? That the name Grofenol had to survive despite it all? Yes, you might be right… I'd still like to see him one last time. - Ah that's not possible, sir. - Not possible? - Why? - You're dead. - What? - He thinks you're dead! Ah, he thinks I'm dead… Don't you think you're jumping the gun a little? Why did you tell him that? Well you understand… He hates you so much he wouldn't have come. - We had to tell him… - …that you'd been buried. Mr. Hector. It's awful. Your cousin has disappeared. I looked everywhere. Miss… Look. A show for you. We'll leave you. We'll take care of your successor. And may God bless you. Ah, there's our little boss. So, did we have fun? Ah, it's the new boss… This time it's for real This time, I won't come back I won't come back! Oh no! Ah, that's it! My little office! Careful, there's a turn. Excuse me. "A" like "Achille". No, it's mine. Please. And here's your office. My office? Mr. Achille, please. Oh, this was his chair. Ah… - Custom-built. - For him? Oh yes. Sorry. Ah, it's outstanding! - Of course! - All this is for me? Sorry, have a seat. Hold on, hold on… I'm not superstitious, but I won't sit in the chair of the deceased. I'd rather eat standing up. Oh really? Well… Well, the red telephone… Well… And the black, obviously… That's Miss Boule, your secretary. She's not very quick, you know. She's easily beaten to the punch. Pleasure to meet you. Oh! Nice to meet you. Well then. I think now that we've been introduced, can he meet Mr. Charles? - Please. - Sorry. Gentlemen… This is Mr. Charles. A pleasure, sir. What an ungracious misunderstanding. I am Charles. I am the model G-E-100… I am intelligent and… …to serve you. We would like a sort of framework law to give Mr. Achille back his natural elegance. Programming… - Say something nice to him. - Nice… How are you? Circuits in good condition. Perfect magnetic memory. But my eye, you can see, isn't what it used to be. Uh… Yes. Thanks. I do not understand the word "thanks". Ah? Well, too bad. Now… Well goodbye, Mr. Charles. Good morning to you. Electronically yours. Well then… What's this? 75 suits from Cardin. 120 pairs of shoes! This machine is out of its mind! Come, let's clean up… - Hello. - Hello, sir. Madame… Sorry, sorry… - Does it hurt? - Not at all. Ah… It's nice. Oh la la… Ladies… No, here. But… Come on, ladies, please! Ah, eh… All right, stop now! Hey! No, I wanted something much more flexible. I'm sure that this… - Here… - I don't want that! This is what I want! My gosh. An Australian cow, look. Ah yes, Australian, yes that's good. Excuse me. It'll fit you like a glove. Yes but like a glove doesn't interest me. It's ridiculous! No, let's do something more romantic. It's nothing, don't fret over it. Don't fret over it! It's fine, it's nothing! He's clumsy! Get out of there! Take my place. Go one, give me your foot. Give me that. I'll show you how it's done. Give me that. What a klutz! That hurts. I'm here. But sir, try it. "Try it, try it" … Let's not fret! Honestly, gentlemen, it's not my size. It's not my size, you see? I don't mean to be mean, sir, but this is not my size. Congratulations. They give you a jack, you give back a king. - Congratulations, Mr. Eugène, and thanks. - Hmm? Well yes, for the military honors. - Ah, you noticed! - Sorry. Sorry… There we are. Did you want it to go to his head? Yes, maybe. Clumsy, huh? - Uh, well… - Uh, well, no. No! And you're hopping over lines? Start over. - The start is… - There. That's better. Getting warmer, warmer! Colder! Oh it's cold! Oh so cold! I'll never make it! What do you want… Don't fret, it's a craft. Use another color, it helps. Blue is good for nerves. Let's go! I can't… Oh, no helping please! Back to your desk! Well, if she wants… There we go… Yes, there we have it! Ah there you go… Well, no! Oh yes, oh yes… You want to skip that line? Cheating? - No. - Come on. There you go. Stop! We finished this test in one hour and 22 minutes. - A good start, no? - Yes. Ink blot test. The most important one. Open the notebook, quick. Open the notebook, quick. Careful… Careful… Thank you. Now close it. Thank you. You're making me want to slap you. No, no, no! Don't expose yourself. Okay, so you're there… You're fine. So, you should be on G now. - Get on G! - That's it! He's like a half-wit there! - Okay, listen… - Don't expose yourself! Good god! All right, on the ground! Oh no, really… I'm going to see what he's up to down there. It's not rocket science. X, D, - I, Z, S! - He almost had it! Now, listen… Now, turn around. He really is the ultimate idiot! What's wrong now? We're going to make you a Top-70 CEO! Like poor Mr. Hector. You see, the ideal CEO is a modern man in direct contact with the manufactured product. His cologne that smells like success. His razorblade is in love. His underwear, I don't have on hand, but you know… His underwear should be moving. Ah! For tough guys with soft skin. Oh it's good… It's so good… It's so good it's almost a sin. But all this is useless if the CEO doesn't have one essential quality, life-changing even: the love for money. Money doesn't buy happiness. Don't speak nonsense! The passion of the CEO isn't caviar, it's not kebabs, nor cheese, nor Chartreuse. Not even love. The passion of CEO is money, you understand? One exception to this rule, however: the cult of great men, like Voltaire, like Racine, like Pascal, but only on paper money. - Ah, Pascal… - Ah, devil! And so, secondly, the CEO, has a certain… How can I put it… A certain… A certain class, you see? You see? Are you listening? Get up! Will you get up? What is this? Will you get up? What's going on? - Sorry… - Yes. A CEO is an attitude. He's camped out behind his desk, his gaze steady. And his glasses, casually gesturing. Gesturing like this, more or less. He has his correspondent here, like this. Do what I tell you, come on. Come on, here we go! That's right, he does this. Well? There, good. That's class, that's stature. There, that's better. You get it? Is all this really necessary? It's indispensable. Because I'll tell you… You have a defect. You're too nice. You're more of a cicada than a crocodile. - Is that bad? - It's catastrophic. However, you can compensate with the CEO smile. It's a very toothy smile. Distinctly pronounced! Do it! Come on! Hey! Give us a big smile! Oh my God… It's dripping in charm! Go, go! Pull! Pull! Pull! No, but give it all you've got! Like this… You look like your dog. We need charm, too. There, line up those teeth for me! If you can line up all 32, it's a win. Hey! Ah! - Ah no, no! - Come on, come on! Come on! How pale you are, my poor friend. You're pale, pale… You need sun, fresh air… Good luck. Something wrong, sir? - Do you like this work? - Yes, sir. That's very good, continue. NO SMOKING - Hello. Ah, hello, my friend. - Mr. Director. So, are you happy? - Yes, yes. - Everything good? Well that's perfect. - Hello, Mr. Director. - Hello. Hello, my son. Hello. Oh, he's cute. Mr. Achille! Come back! You'll get lost! Let him play CEO in his factory. He'll get into shape. Into shape? To sign our paper, idiot. Oh! Hold this for me. Mr. Achille! Mr. Achille! Someone's in your office for you. - A moment. - All right, back to work! Back to work! Come here, my dear. All right, back to work! Ah no! No, no and no! Is something wrong, sir? No, that won't do. I spoke to Romulus. He agrees, we're leaving. What are we waiting for? - Wait, he speaks? - Of course, like all dogs. Yes, we're going back to Cazalan, old chap. Too long in the factory. It's exhausting. Yes, it's tiring. You can tell your factory that. So much smoke! And there's no greenery to regenerate. - And the atmosphere… - The atmosphere? Atmosphere! Yes, the atmosphere! Atmospheric pollution, heard of it? You're so right. Paris has no seasons anymore. But sign, and you can go home to Cazalan. - Perfect. - There, sign right here. Go on, get lost! Please. She's bigger than she looks! Call a doctor! - Good. - Quick, get down here. - We have to talk. - Yes. Don't sign. They're terrible, they're going to rob you. See you soon, mission accomplished. She must be in shock. Well say, to find a doctor in the summer… It's… Well… Where's the sick girl? Uh… Don't worry. Just a short bout of depression. Good! It's our turn, gentlemen… Change of plans! I'm a Grofenol, and a Grofenol never gives in! Mr. Hector tried all the lines. - There you are, it suits you. - Yes… Yes, I think so, but… I think the cut is good. A little tight here, but overall, it's good. And so for the other items, go up there, on the terrace. On the terrace? Hey, wait! Well where did he go? NO SMOKING Oh, look up there! Achille is on the trampoline! - What's that? - Look up there! - Achille! - You forgot to put the springs back! Oh crap! Don't jump! Wait, Mr. Achille! Please! What is that? What the… Hector… Hector! Oh no! That's not cool. That's not cool at all. It's not cool, what you did. But what did I do? You didn't die! You can't always get what you want. Well, it's dishonest. Disho… Oh no, I protest! I'm not dishonest. - What? - Those two bastards are dishonest! They made you think I was dead so you'd come. Yes, I know, I'm a wretch. Well then beat me, pinch me, crush me, whatever you like. I betrayed your trust, I admit. But now it's over. It's over, Achille, believe me. I'll do anything. I'll sign a power of attorney to you. I'll do whatever you want. - Anything? - Anything. Absolutely anything? Yes, absolutely anything. - Miss nurse! - Oh come on, not that. Some paper and a pen. Sign. Sign? Sign where? - The bottom. - The bottom? But it's in white. You got a problem with white? Oh yes! So my word isn't enough, then? I prefer a power of attorney. Come on, Achille, you know me. Exactly. Sign. It's not easy with a cast, you know. Perfect. Mr. Hector! Oh, Mr. Hector! Mr. Hector, it's terrible! Oh, sir, your poor cousin… What poor cousin? What happened to poor cousin? Hmm? Oh nothing… figure of speech. Little sneak, you didn't tell me my cousin was still among us. - But I… I didn't know. - Ask for forgiveness. Put this in the safe. And now, gentlemen, a question. Starting today, who's the boss? His name is Grof! Well, well, what do you say, my darlings? Sing, my little ones. Sing like in Cazalan, remember? Wait, gentlemen! Most importantly, no mistakes! Here's what I planned. We have 1,000 roses for Mr. Hector, right? I hope he'll be happy. Oh, that hurts. You also have 1,200 orchids for the factory women, 500 gladiolas for the typists, and finally, 100 green plants to decorate the factory. And finally, my two cacti… Is he nuts? Is he nuts? But… This is going to cost us a fortune! Roses… Roses! What matters is work! What's the matter, snookums? Achille is trying to bankrupt me. But look! I think it's really pretty. I thought you liked orange blossom. Isn't that nice… Who's it from? There's no card… Good morning, ladies. Hello, sir. So guys, how's it going? Going well. You don't need anything? A bolt, a little screw? And you guys? Nothing for now? - And you my son, how are you? - I'm good. - You have enough holes? - Yes. What did I do? You look exhausted. Oh la la, don't stay here! Go home. Tell your wife to make you some nice broth. Here. Take these herbs. All right, go! Don't worry. We're here, by golly! It's not rocket science. You'll see… - Mr. Achille! - Yes? Mr. Eugène is asking about the flowers. Good, good… First off, you could have helped me. - Put up this tent. - Sorry. Yes, put up this tent. Carry me for a minute. Lazy. Ah, that's smart! Well go on, finish it now! Finish the job, by golly! Go on! And then figure it out! Go on. Say, miss, what's your name? Well… Boule, sir. No, I know that. Your first name. Adélaïde Pétronille Martine. Good. So I'll just say Martine. Right? I've said it time and again, no guns here. Simply use a paintbrush. So, as we can see… it's just as handsome. And then this one. The paintbrush is good, you see? There, just flowers, just flowers… Oh, aren't flowers beautiful… Try. Your turn, son. So you have to paint there. No, thanks. It's fine. A bit of white, a Bordeaux? No, thanks. And you, some Bordeaux over here? No thanks. One sheep's milk. Sheep's milk! One sheep's milk! Here, son. That will do you good. - How's the appetite? - It's okay. - All good? - Thanks. Bordeaux, sheep's milk! Good God, whose idea was it to bring this destroyer of my business? Try guessing! Well yes… It wasn't my day. Ah but wait… Wait, wait… You're giving me ideas. It took you long enough! No that's not it at all. We're on different wavelengths. No, the wedding ring needs to be earned. Listen… Striptease is good. But burglary… is better. You're going to hustle… the power of attorney. - Me? - Yes. Mr. Achille, since we're alone, I'd like to tell you that… Mr. Achille… Since we're alone, I'd like to tell you… No. Mr. Achille… Since we're alone, well… I'd like to tell you… No. Achille… We're alone… It's good for wrinkles. Yes, it's a sort of yoga, you see. - What can I do for you? - Well? - Do you take delivery, yes or no? - Uh, yes… For what? For me. What a question! One second, let me get my coat. This is my contract. You can read it. It says that Gloria is committed to the personal service of the company's CEO, with a salary of 3,217.75 francs. Social security, executive retirement. Yes, it's for the tax authorities. Mr. Hector's idea. Personal service? Well yes, his girlfriend, if you will. You're held to 28 hours per month. But I don't see him anymore. Since he's paralyzed, I… Yes, obviously… You can't deliver. Yes, that's it. Delivering to a wheelchair is pretty hard. But where do I come in? You're the CEO of the Grofenol company. And how! Well, it's so silly! On the contract, there's no name in front of CEO. So you're the one I need to deliver to! Well bravo! Don't mind us. What is all this? Nothing, nothing… Some delivery issues. But nothing to worry about. Now if you don't mind, we'll rehearse the Grof show! The minister sees it tomorrow. Come on, come here. We're rehearsing the rhythm. Straight line. Form a straight line. Ready, we're starting! One, two, three, four! There's no mystery, we all agree That won't do… Let's dance! Ah no, it's completely stupid! Come on, snap out of it! You want me to slap you? Again, pay attention. Thanks, Mr. Achille… - Bravo. - Oh yes. So what? You really are a Grofenol. Maybe the power is getting to you. - Listen, Miss Boule… - Achille! We rehearsing or what? That's enough from you! Everyone out, out! Say, art and you, that makes two. Miss Boule! Miss Boule! - Charles. - What is it? Sorry to wake you. It's for a consultation. If I may, your transistors look awful. It doesn't look like you're well Well, I'm not well. But anyway, it's nice to talk like this. I want to drop everything. Ridiculous. Oh, sorry. Hasty conclusion. Ah wait… you can't look at me when I talk to you? I have the blues. Like a weight in my throat. I see flowers. Flowers everywhere. What does that mean? At first glance, it's an illness that I cannot catch. You are 100% in love. What stupidity! Admire the face of your stupidity. But… that's my secretary. Do you believe there is incompatibility between the secretary and love? There's no reason for it. Why? No. Snookums! Who's there? It's your little delivery. - Oh! - Oh, snookums! Oh, listen to me, snookums! - Snookums! - Busy! What does snookums do at night? At night, snookums sleeps! Okay, come here! There. He's scared too. What a family! What is that? There! There! There, take that! So, where is the lucky guy? Oh it's not what you think. They're no fun in this family. There's your stud now. Mr. Achille! Mr. Achille! - Mr. Achille! - What is it? No! Leave me alone! Hurry up, the minister's arriving! Give me that, would you. The minister? - Yes. - I'm going. - Did you say minister? - Yes. Get out of there, you. Out. Out! Get out! Come! Hurry up. - Hurry up! - Yes. Where is your suit? My suit, it's… Where is my suit? Well, hurry, the minister's waiting. He's waiting, he's waiting… Someone stole it… My suit! Ah, it's… So what? Crazy. - Mr. minister. - Hello, gentlemen. If you wouldn't mind following us? The minister! That's going to be a catastrophe. Mr. minister, please, for the ORTF. - What's your take on the politics… - I'm a tourist here. Not a politician. PROHIBITED TO PROHIBIT Here it is. Mister! The pants! You forgot your pants! The pants! Sir! LOVE FLOWERS Here's the little painting. This is all great. Yes, I'll accept. Perfect, I congratulate you. No, gentlemen, please. Quick, quick, quick! Come on, let's go! Come on, quick! Easy now! Say, the boss is somebody. Ah, finally. Give me that. Come on, let's hurry. Hurry. Here, you're in the carpentry, Mr. Minister. May I? This way. Here's the revival of the industry! Here's the example for all other factories! Here's how the working France will be! Here's how… Ah yes, that's true. Mr. Minister, Mr. Grofenol is waiting. No, no. Oh, Mr. Minister. - Mr. Minister, listen… - Excuse me. - Mr. Minister… - No, that's not him! No, that's not him. - Mr. Minister. - No, not him! …for Midi tourism. As you can see, gentlemen, we've prepared a private reception. If you don't mind, we'll get up. - Get him up. - No, get the minister up first. Grab his leg. Let us through! This way, gentlemen! This way, gentlemen. It's the purpose of my visit in this model factory. Ah but it's not the Tourism Merit. We're short for now. Oh well, that's not important. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Minister, for reminding us that without Grof tents, French tourism couldn't host foreign currency, for a lack of hotels. There. All good, TV people? Is it how you wanted it? Everything okay? Workmen and workwomen, I know you expect a lot from me. For a long time, I've been in the factory's reserves, and I asked myself during this desert crossing what I would do if I came into power. Well now I know, I will share it! I'm a huge fan of this guy. Way better than the paralyzed one. So from now on, you're no longer workers, but shareholders! He's nuts! You're nuts! Your salaries will increase 100%! Holiday allocations will be doubled for the pale and exhausted. Attention! There will be buses and caravans to go to the sea. Bravo! You will tap into our stock of Grof tents, Grof parasols, and your million Grof children will jump in Grof balloons while drinking Grof milk! Oh no… To live to see this… What a tragedy… Can't you just fire him? Fire him? No, impossible. He holds the reins. We must retake them. No, sir. Power is taken back with blood. The traitor must be chastized. Accidentally, of course. Mr. Achille. They want to kill you. - I heard it. - Kill me how? Me? You're just teasing. I saw them! They want to light your RV on fire. Come. No. That's nothing, it's a… It's a sleepwalker. Fire! What's wrong? What are they up to? What is it? Well then. Get me two dozen and make a pyramid with them. I'll draw it for you. Guillaume, when you have a minute, unhook that weight hanging there. Never know, it could hurt someone, right? What now? Hmm? The cigars you like, sir. What's this I hear about camping gas cylinders leaking? Check the stock yourself, sir. NO SMOKING That's it, they killed him! Oh… Martine… This is no time to sleep. Good God, if she were dead… My dear Martine, it's me. - Ah… - It's me. It's me. It's me! They missed you again. Well what do I do now? I've got an idea, but… Continue. It's paradoxical, but the operation is profitable. Cheers! It won't be long, you'll see. Everyone's behind me. Happy, engaged, and efficient! Behind their killer CEO! I am my brand image. I'm revved up like an engine. Grof will be a mark of excellence in all of Europe! Yes? Hello, Rockefeller? No! Signature, let's go! Say! That's it, you're everywhere. Look at this. This is a serious illness. It's a global epidemic, truly. No, no… You don't like it? Yes? Sell, my friend. Absolutely. Oh really? Yes. Buy! You can buy, I'm interested. Hello, yes? Buy. Sell! Absolutely not. No, because I just told you so. Mr. Hector on line one. Well, well, well… What is it? Is it a tantrum or blackmail? Neither, it's a transfer. I'm changing nurseries. No but… But my little gem, you… You wouldn't do that? After all these years… Oh get over yourself! Or else make me an offer. But I warn you: your competition is quick to close. "Competition"? You mean that other clown? And why not? He's more fun than you think. He built his little business by himself. And now, it's all his. Oh yes, oh yes, of course! I've never been a snake oil salesman. I don't believe in anything anymore. Robbed, sovietized and cuckold on top of that… No, it's too much. That's right! Cry now. That's what was missing! - You phoney! - Gloria! Gloria! Bitch. Come on, number four! Go number four! Number four! Number four! Go number four! Good evening, ma'am. Evening, Mr. Grof. Evening, Lucien. You're well? Yes, sir. Hello, New York? I'll hold, I'll hold. I've been dating this guy two months. And what's happened, you ask? Nothing. Hello, yes? Yes. Grof Export here. Pass me Rockefeller. Yes. Rocky? I'm warning you. We're chatting. Well we're chatting! Say, snookums… When do I get my little list? List? You know, the little bridal list. Ring, white dress… No! Oh, what a family! - Hello! - They're worthless! Hello? Oh, hello? Yes! Well what are you waiting for? Snoozing? Go on, get going! Oh really? If I understand correctly, the competition didn't close. - What's it to you? - Oh, to me, nothing. I find it pretty funny. So of course, you come crawling back. - Yeah. - I don't get it, you see. I'm not so young anymore. I'm not that handsome. I'm nearly crippled, sick… So why would you want to marry me? For your money, of course! I'm obsessed with money. - I love money. - You love? You love money? Why didn't you say so earlier? I also love it. It's all I live for. My darling, all this brings us closer. We'll be very happy Oh yes, we'll have lots of children. Oh yes, little ones who are like us. They'll also love money. Ah, you see, it works. - Hello? - Hello, boss? We're at the airport. Ah, the two clowns… Yes, boss. Eugène went to pick up Sitting. Sitting? He's…He's with you? Bring him here! Trust us, boss. We'll warm him up for you. Bring him here, quick! Of course! Make sure no one sees him, okay? Especially not Achille. You'll have your contract, your 5,000 kangaroos. The dollars will come in. Mr. Sitting, Mr. Grofenol vous attend. Now, where were we in our romantic conversation? Later, darling, later. For now, let's focus on making a cool 200 million for incidentals, the ring, all that. Shh. He's very weak. I'll replace him. I have a nice signature. Okay. Look. Look at him. He's a wreck. I assure you, he's very ill. He may be a wreck, but he's also an imposter. What? But I assure you… That's not the Mr. Grof I saw on the cover of Time. - Oh well that… - Bye. Excuse me! Cut this. Hello, yes? Hello? Save me from the Australians. They want kangaroos. Good, sir. It's Dior, they want to make a Grof perfume. What are they offering? - 13%. - Well. I'll do 20. - Hello, yes? - Hello? We're good for 20%. I'm sorry sir. We've already… Ah, yes. Have a seat. - The bribes have been sent? - The bribes? Yes, you understand me? I'm Mr. Sitting from Oklahoma City. Ah yes. What can I do for you? Hello? Yes, I'm listening. Hello, yes? Ask for Grof courses at closing. Sure. A check from First National City Bank. Ah, yes. Hello, yes? Plus eight? Ah, yes… You said the opposite. Checkout! Come, sir. You see you're in the way. Hey, say, Mr. Cowboy. Us working together doesn't mean you can poach my staff. Hello, Mr. Grofenol. At ease! Guillaume, Honoré, Eugène! Everyone on deck. And hurry! This place is letting itself go. And this, then… It's zero! Zero. The syntax… The spelling… The margins… Reduce those margins! We're being wasteful! And get these creatures to stop, they're killing me! Oh, Mr. Achille, your little cicadas! Miss, you are an anthology of negligence. So please, don't stoop to melodrama. It's crazy how he's changed. He wants to devour it all. Gluttony really does a number. He was so nice before. - Here, drink. - No. To forget. Those things are still here? I'm losing it. - Your pills. - Ah, my pills. Oh no! I'm fed up! No, that's enough! Look at him, the emperor of business, he wants to kill cicadas with his shoe! You've changed, Mr. Achille. Oh, excuse me. Mr. Grof. All that's left for you is cannibalism. Don't worry, you'll get there. But I'm jumping ship before the catastrophe! Honoré. - Is it true? - What? - Well… - Yes. Did you hear, Mr. Charles? I am not deaf. And their analysis is correct. Power corrupts. Your internal circuits couldn't resist. They need oxygen You must be reprogrammed. "To be reprogrammed" … "To be reprogrammed". Agony brings you joy. No… I felt better temporarily. Of course, you know how it is, the calm before… Don't wear yourself out. I'm done being your fool. Enough of your shenanigans. My… My… How funny, boss, how funny! That's it, we found something. Guillaume, show him. Each ball has 100 grams of powder. You turn the handle a bit, and it sets off a timer. Then, boom! So. Bluffer, reaper, and now murderer. Ah no! It's a joke, a gadget. - It's a… - Here it goes. It's going! It's… It's… Oh no! You take it! Oh no, it's gonna blow! It's gonna blow! That's clever. Ah, that's clever. That's clever… That's clever. Ah yes, that's clever. Ah it's clever! Oh, snookums! Oh my snookums! Oh my poor snookums, what happened to you? You're not hurt, are you? Oh no, don't fret, my angel. It's the nurse. Well, yes. We're getting married. We're getting married like this? Oh no! Oh no! As for you, you awful little creeps, your thwarted attacks were funny but boring. Oh but of course, if you're nitpicking… This kind of nitpicking, catches bigger vermin than you think. So, will it be the cops or the broom? Yes, you can stay here as janitors. - I'm leaving. - No, no! We'll stay with him! I warn you, he'll be worse. Oh no! We'll get minimum wage? We'll see. - With… an end of year bonus… - Ah yes… Up for debate. No what are you doing? Oh no! Oh no, you won't hit a cripple will you? Look at that… I'm walking! Well, you can stand to hear what I have to say then. - What is this? - That's your power of attorney. I'm going back to Cazalan. Ah no, no! You wouldn't leave me alone with those two! It'll be my pleasure. No, no, Grof, I beg you, stay! Stay! We're a good team, aren't we? - Oh yes… - You know… All the changes, what you did, it's great. We'll keep it all. Oh yeah? I have to mention then, that the Grof operation is mine. All you need to do is send me a money order. 12 million. 12 million. Per month. 12 mill… In old francs? These crackpots are going to leave me here. Achille! Achille! - Who's calling me? - Me. - Where are we going? - Gare de Lyon. I'm going to Cazalan. - Love it or hate it… - I love it. So driver, you asleep? Look! - Come on! - No, I want to go home! To the town hall! You promised! - Your hat! Come get it! - My hat! Don't play with that! Can you leave me alone! - Oh come now! - You'll get me hurt! I'm not going to the town hall! Oh you are! I've got nothing against the town hall. Do you? Subtitle translation by: Anca Ulea
