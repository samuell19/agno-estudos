Please sit. Gentlemen, you are the senior officers of our defence services, the police and intelligence department. The topic for this meeting is a grave matter. In fact, very dangerous. It is insufficient to just talk about it. According to this CBI case report, the powers spreading violence and vandalism are on the rise. Business groups, that deal in black marketing and adulteration, now also smuggle drugs as well as weapons. This is not some stray incident. We’re dealing with a huge organisation. And there is someone outside our country funding it. - Hail Mogambo! - Hail Mogambo! - Hail Mogambo! - Hail Mogambo! Hail Mogambo! - Hail Mogambo! - Hail Mogambo! Hail Mogambo! Mr Mogambo, we’ve destroyed all granaries in the country, and whatever grain was left we mixed with stones, and sold it at extortionate prices. Mr Mogambo... we created more than 100,000 gambling dens and pubs. Mr Mogambo, we are making huge profits. Mogambo is pleased. Daaga! Teja! Use this profit to destroy and disrupt all daily life. Throughout India – these riots, killing, looting, stabbing, all this chaos – if we can continue in this manner, the day is not far off when Mogambo’s dream shall be realised! Captain Zorro. We shall need a base on Bombay’s coast from where we can send weapons as and when we please. It shall be done. Right, Daaga and Teja? - Definitely. - Yes, sir. Mogambo is pleased. Oh, those laughable Indians! They still haven’t learnt anything from their history! Every time they fight amongst themselves, they are enslaved by a foreign power. Yet they keep fighting amongst themselves – all in the name of religion, parentage, or caste! Mogambo shall provide the weapons for them to kill each other. And when they have hacked away their own country’s foundation, then, then I shall take my final step, and all of India shall be at my feet! And every Indian my slave! All will shout out loud, “Hail Mogambo, the king of India!” Hail Mogambo, king of India! Hail Mogambo! Hail Mogambo! Hail Mogambo! Hail Mogambo! Mogambo is pleased. You! You! You! Hail Mogambo! - Jump! - Hail Mogambo! - Jump! - Hail Mogambo! - Jump! - Hail Mogambo! Mogambo is pleased. The day I get the formula... - Which formula? - The use of which... man can become invisible! A formula that make you invisible? Is that even possible? And why not? Science has always progressed in leaps and bounds. It’s wrong to assume that what is not known today will never be possible. Not so long ago, just 100 or 150 years, if somebody then would have said there will be iron ships that fly in the air, and that can take you places in minutes, people would take him for a madman. But that’s exactly how it turned out. And nobody is surprised to see them today. If someone would’ve told Akbar about telephone, radio, or motorcars, he wouldn’t believe it. We are not willing to believe that which we cannot see. In those days it was impossible to believe that your insides could be photographed. Then people laughed as you do now, but nowadays X-rays are a normal thing. - Sir... - Yes, Raman? Sir, just as X rays lets you look inside a person, could science invent something that could turn man invisible? What kind of stupid question is that? Nothing like this is possible! But, sir, you said that science... Please sit down! This is no time for jokes! Sit down! So, Doctor Jagdish Varma, - you will now give us the formula. - I’ll do no such thing! Don’t be foolish! If you refuse to cooperate, your assistant Professor Sinha will give it to us anyway. So stop being so stubborn. Just give us the formula, and we’ll make you a rich man. I will not be bought! I’m calling the police! No, don’t! Mr Sinha? Catch him! Don’t let him escape! Sir... Oh, Raman. - What’s the matter? - Sir, I made you upset during class, - So I... - No, that’s quite all right. Actually, I was in the wrong. Your question was valid, but only that man could’ve answered it. Who is that? He was a great scientist. Raman, you might recall I introduced you to his son, Arun. - The one with all those kids, you said? - Indeed, that’s the one. He spent his childhood without his parents, so he feels their pain. Whenever he sees an orphan, he takes it home. So his house has become a kind of mini hostel. Calendar? Hey, Calendar? Oh no, my eggs! Calendar? Hey, Calendar? What is it, Arun? Why are you crowing my name like a madman, this early in the morning? First of all, I don’t understand why your parents named you Calendar. They wanted to give me an English name. Even if your name was Queen Elizabeth, you’d still be a cook! - Where were you dead? - In my room. Die wherever you want, but tell me this: why do I have to cook half the kids’ breakfast myself, every morning? Can you tell me this, Calendar? Tell me, speak up, answer! That’s just tough luck, Arun. Whose mistake is that? The mistake is you don’t know the difference between sleeping and dying. Everybody sleeps, but you never get up. I warn you, Calendar, if you’re late tomorrow, I’ll deduct it from your salary. Sure, go ahead. At least then I’ll see some money. By God, it’s been five years since I’ve received any salary! - What colour is money nowadays? - It’s purple. Really? Arun, hear this for morning news: our provision stock is almost empty. Oh, we can get some more from Roopchand’s shop. Some more news: Maniklal came asking for the rent. Yeah, we’ll pay it eventually – we’re not running away with his house. - Did the kids bathe already? - Yes, only yesterday. Now they’re sleeping in their beds, dreaming sweet dreams. Good morning, children. Good morning, children. Good morning, children. Good morning, children. Good morning, good morning. Kids, get up quickly and come down. Go to the bathroom, one by one. Brush your teeth. Let’s go. Let’s go, Jugal. Quick. Arun, it’s great to wake up with this shower, every morning. Well, Jugal, I also think it would be great if you got up and went to school without this cloudless rain. Arun, why do we have to go to school so early? Everything starts early. Life sleeps in the night and awakes in the morning. We must abide to that order. Arun, why does Monday follow Sunday? Just as sorrow is followed by happiness and vice versa, just as the days follows nights, so Sunday also is followed by Monday. - And what comes after Saturday? - Sunday! Sunday! That’s just the way life is – you win only after you’ve lost. That’s just the way life is – you win only after you’ve lost. Sometimes tears, sometimes smiles, if today is gloomy, then tomorrow will be bright. That’s just the way life is – you win only after you’ve lost. Sometimes tears, sometimes smiles, if today is gloomy, then tomorrow will be bright. That’s just the way life is – you win only after you’ve lost. The night is part of life, and so is dawn. The night is part of life, and so is dawn. Life is a journey and a final destination, as well. Life is a journey and a final destination, as well. One moment tears of grieve, another moment tears of joy. For each new moment there is a new song – that’s just the way life is. While sorrow hovers over our life, we must deploy a smile. While sorrow hovers over our life, we must deploy a smile. Let the shining hope in our hearts brighten our eyes every day. For today’s loss will be tomorrow’s gain. Let today’s grudge turn into tomorrow’s sympathy. Time is like a friend, you know. That’s just the way life is. That’s just the way life is – you win only after you’ve lost. Sometimes tears, sometimes smiles, if today is gloomy, then tomorrow will be bright. That’s just the way life is – you win only after you’ve lost. Fool! Why am I paying you if you can’t lift those sacks? Hello, Roopchand! Hello! I’m doomed. You’re back? So soon? You’ll clear out my shop on that credit of yours! I’ll go bankrupt! May your rivals turn bankrupt. I always pray that you prosper. I’m really doomed. - Hi, Roop. - Oh, hi. Roopchand, I think it best if I make my full payment to you in one go. Full payment? You? He’s laughing. Arun, didn’t I tell you he’d laugh? Why are you just standing there? Take the rice, wheat, all that you want. It’s Roopchand’s shop, after all. Just put everything on my tab. Every month I tell myself to stop giving you credit, - but my heart is too soft. - Your heart is fine. There’s no other shop where the prices of rice, wheat, and stones are the same. Except in your shop. Here they are the same. - How very nice. - Oh, I’m doomed... You think there are too many stones in my rice and wheat? Then why don’t just go to another store? How could we, dear Roopchand? We’ve grown used to it – we can’t enjoy our meal anymore unless we gnash on some stones. We should be heading home, Arun. I have to cook. But before that, I have to pick the rice out of the stones. I promise, Roopchand, I’ll give you full payment in two to three days. But now I have to leave to give music tuitions. Bye, Roop. Thanks. I am doomed. - This is the house. - I see. So it seems. Mr Teja, we must have this house at any cost. We do? What for? Mr Teja, Mr Mogambo demanded a base from which he can send any amount of weapons through all of India. Don’t you worry, Mr Daaga, I’ll have it vacated in no time. - How? - You’ll see. I have a hold here. Consider it done, Mr Teja. Curse me if I can’t do it. Pularam? Have you got the black stones to mix in the black lentils? Yes, sir. Black gravel for the lentils, white ones for the rice, and brown ones for the wheat. We’ve got 100 sacks of each. We are making a vast profit by the hour! - Really? Making much money? - Just a bit, by your grace. - Shall I take leave? - Yes, scram. - But I want the house vacated. - I’ve got the owner in my pocket. We’ll get him round in no time. You want the house and you’ll get it. Vacate the house? What do you mean by that, Maniklal? Just what I say. But we’ve been living here for years, Maniklal. Why should I take that into account, and not the fact that you haven’t paid the rent? - I will gladly pay, but... - You have to pay it now. Pay up all that you owe me, or move out of the house. You’re doomed. You don’t have that money, so you’ll have to move out. Let’s go, Maniklal. Here. Take this. If we don’t pay this sum, we’ll lose this house, for sure. And the kids? Where could I take them? Arun, I think I have an idea. Why don’t we let out the room on top? I mean to a paying guest. - Great idea. - Of course it is. I’ll go straight to Akbar Press Office and draw up an ad. ... and you have been working in this office for ten years, but you don’t know anything! How long can I tolerate you? - Hello? - Ruby Talkies? What? No use printing this. - No use printing what? - I’m not talking to you, madam! Could you please book me two tickets for the matinee? No, I can’t book your tickets! - This is Ruby Talkies, right? - No, this isn’t Ruby Talkies, this is the Akbar Crimes of India office! Can you get that into your head? Wrong number! Go and give that to the... to the reader! Hello? What? Say what? Your buffalo stopped giving milk? And what am I supposed to do about that? What can I do? Am I a veterinary? Please try to understand my problem! Please! For God’s sake! Please! For God’s sake! - Airam! - Yes, sir? - Where is she? - Who, sir? That... What’s her name... well, that girl. - What girl, sir? - That what’s-her-name girl! Good morning, everyone. Here, type this and put it on the editor’s desk. Quick. Sorry. “Sorry” is such annoying word. People can just blunder away and then simply say “sorry”. Mr Gupta, why was this news item still on my desk? Why hasn’t it gone into print? - I’m sorry. - Again “sorry”. The day will come when thieves get away by simply saying sorry. Sorry, sorry. Sorry, excuse me. - Good morning, sir. - Come in, Seema. The article you sent me, I’ve brought it back. You brought it back. Good! - Why did you throw it on the chair? - Well, you’re sitting on the table, so I thought the paper should go on the chair. Uhm, I’m sorry. What can I do if your pyjamas aren’t washed clean? No, this isn’t Bharat Laundry! Wrong number! Well, this... This article won’t be printed this Sunday – you handed it in too late. Obviously. What can I do about it? My landlord has these children, and I simply cannot work around children. So I’m looking for a new place. - Please be seated. - Why are kids born as kids? Why can’t they be born as adults? I agree with you. Now, do you have another scoop for me? Yup, a very interesting story. This man has just been released from jail. He’s just 25 years old, but has been in prison for over 50 times! - What’s his name? - He’s called Manglu. I’ve sent Khanna to bring him to the office. Our readers will read his interview with great interest! Madam? Madam? Madam, I have a house with a room on top. - I’d like to place an ad. - Just go in there. Give me four copies of this, please. So... You’re him? - Yes, it’s me. - Please sit down. Please. Please speak your mind. And don’t be scared. Why should I be scared? It’s a matter of joy. Good. So... Sorry. Since when were you... the way you are? I’ve always been like this. From childhood? I see. And why do you do... all the things you do? For the money, simple as that. Actually, I’m not really happy with it. But sometimes a man has to go against his own wishes, desperate. You think all those who are desperate are bound to become thieves? No-no-no, most of them are honest. What you get out of life, is what counts and what shapes you as a person. You know? Let me think... Right. How old were you when you first went to jail? Uhm, I must have been... What did you say? Me, in jail? Yes, haven’t you been incarcerated for fifty times? Fifty times? Who told you that? - How many times, then? - Well, about... I’ve never been to jail! Why? Do you wish to send me there? Is this a newspaper office or a police station? - Don’t shout. - What do you mean, “don’t shout”? - Listen, Manglu... - Manglu? What’s this “Manglu”? Who is Manglu? Where is Manglu? - Madam, my name is Arun Varma. - Arun? But if you aren’t Manglu, then what are you doing in this room? You are here too, and I’m guessing you’re not Manglu, either. I am the crime reporter. Who are you? Why are you? What do you want? I came to for an ad to rent out a room. But now all I want to do is leave! Good day. Hey! Careful. Madam, that lady in red-white, does she work here? - Come here. - What now? - Are you married? - I... I wasn’t advertising that! Yes, I know that. Sorry... I just want to know if you have any children. - I’ll have kids when I marry! - Yes, of course. - Let me go, madam. I want to leave. - Listen... Just listen to me! Do you think you could give me the room you wanted to let out? Well, why didn’t you say so? Madam, what a room! A lovely room. A balcony in front of it. A garden in front of the balcony and then the sea. A cool breeze, all day long! 24 hours! And that absolutely for free, madam! - Deal. I’ll take it. - Don’t you want to see it? The moment you said, “no kids,” I was sold. Here, an advance of 500. - But the children... - Are not there, right? So I’m taking it. Fine, the room is yours. God knows the rest. Here we are! There she lies, madam! Isn’t it wonderful? Song of praise were written for this kind of mansion! Calendar! - Calendar? - Calendar, the cook. Let’s go! Let’s go! Madam, have you seen how peaceful, how beautiful it is here? - Calendar, is everything fine inside? - Yes, the children... - Children? - No, not children. With “children” I meant to say “the suitcases.” I’ve arranged the small and big suitcases. Enter, madam. Enter. Thank God, the coast is clear! - What? - He means it’s so clean in here. How pretty, how lovely! How quiet... Quiet! Silence envelopes you. - Do you see? - Yes. Indeed. It’s essential for my work that I have peace around me. Then you’ve come to the right place. You’ll pine to hear a human voice. Shall we go upstairs? I’ll show you to your room. - What’s with you? - Shall we go up? Yes. See this? These steps go up. And they also come down. - That’s amazing. Very nice. - Everything is looked after. You see? You see, madam? - Uhm, Calendar? - Yes, Arun? - Have you gathered all the lady’s bags? - Yes, I have. But, Arun, what about those “little bags” downstairs? - I’ll take care of about that myself. - All right. Good luck. It’s in your hands, now. Madam... Do you like the room? Madam? It’s fine. It’s fine... I could write ghost stories in here. What’s wrong? What’s wrong? What is it? Cockroach! Cockroach! Cockroach! Where... Where is that cockroach? Where? It’s looking at me! - Are you scared of a cockroach? - Madam, lions don’t frighten me, - but yes, I’m terrified of cockroaches! - Why get scared of a cockroach? Get somebody who can kill it! But then children will come here. Then just call them. At least we’ll get rid of this pest! So he cockroach will die, but the kids will stay. Is that agreed? Yes! Quickly call somebody! Children! Help! Cockroach! Cockroach! Cockroach! Yay! - Careful, madam. - What’s going on? - What are all these kids doing here? - Killing the cockroach. Oh, God! You fraud! You said you didn’t have kids! - I spoke the truth; they aren’t mine. - You rogue! I’ll report you to the police! I’ll take you to Supreme Court! Sure. But look – see how these kids are working for you? They will catch it. Gotcha! Look, you took my 500 bucks earlier, and a deposit after that. I want all my money back. Right now! We already spent it all. Cockroach! Get out! Madam, you can stay here until you get your money’s worth. Longer too, if you wish. But what I said is true – a room with a balcony in front, then a garden with the sea in front. Madam? Mr Sinha, you always said my father was a great scientist, that he had made an invention that has no comparison in this world. What was it? What it was? I normally don’t tell people, because I know they won’t believe me, but since you’re his son, I believe I can tell you. He made a gadget. Wear it on the wrist, switch it on, and man can’t be seen. Man can’t be seen? How is that possible? - How come man can’t be seen in the dark? - Because there’s no light. Why can he be seen only when there is light? Huh? I’ll tell you. When light touches somebody and reflects, he can be seen. If something can create a field in our bodies whereby light goes straight through the body, then that person cannot be seen. Didn’t understand? Just like with glass – light goes through glass similarly. I see you don’t believe me. No, I do, Mr Sinha, but... But where is this gadget that sends light through our bodies? Your father knew it could be misused, so he burnt the formula. But where is the gadget? Do you have it? Just forget about it. You were looking for a paying guest. Have you found anyone yet? We have found someone – a girl. And what a girl! Wow! Wow! Stop it! Stop it! If you don’t stop making that noise, I’ll report it to the police! You’ll be wearing handcuffs, cooling your heels in prison! What is a prison? You’re back, and just in time. Look what’s going on. Arun, we’re going to wear handcuffs. - What happened, madam? - He asks what happened. You told me you have a room with a balcony in front and a garden. But you forgot to tell me the garden contained kids with a football! I’m sorry, madam. There will be no noise from now on. Thank you very much. Thank you. Didn’t I tell you not to make such noise? - What does she think of herself? - We were just playing! Aren’t we even allowed to play anymore? I’m not saying you can’t play. Just go and play on the beach. And I will join you! Come on, kids! Let’s go! Madam? I’m sorry, madam, it was my mistake. Madam, please hear me out. Madam, it wasn’t the kids’ fault. Actually, it was me who... Yeah, sure, I get it. This is just one big conspiracy against me. But even if all the kids of the world unite, this plan won’t succeed! Mr Arun Varma, I’ll move the courts! This football will go to court! Why? Nobody plays football in court. I will see you... I will see you in the court! Madam? Madam, please listen to me. I won’t spare you. No way. How dare they? Those damned kids... I will show them. We’re not asking for gold or silver, we only seek your forgiveness. Let us show you how sorry we are. We’re not asking for gold or silver, we only seek your forgiveness. Let us show you how sorry we are. Our ball is so dear to us. Our ball is so dear to us. Please, please, dear sister, give us back our football. Please, please, dear sister, give us back our football. Give us back our football. Give us back our football. All day, all night you harass me. Even if you grovel at my feet, I’m not returning the football. I’m not returning the football. All day, all night you harass me. Sorry, dear sister up above, we won’t cream anymore. Not “cream”, it’s “scream”. Scream. Sorry, dear sister up above, we won’t scream anymore. But if we cannot play out here, we’ll be bored out of our minds. Sorry, dear sister up above, we won’t scream anymore. But if we cannot play out here, we’ll be bored out of our minds. No, no, no, no, no, no. Cut it out, cut it out. Stop this farce, right now. I know you’re faking it. Girl, you’re not so fragile as you look. You’re the leader of the pack. Stop this farce, right now. Why do you resent my children? Oh, why do you resent my children? What’s the use of fighting about it? What’s the use of fighting about it? Tell me what grudge you hold against them. Tell me what grudge you hold against them. Why do you resent my children? What’s the use of fighting about it? You with the hat... get our ball back. You with the hat... get our ball back. We wonder why our sister is so upset. Help us to get our ball back. You with the hat... You with the hat... You with the hat... My name is Calendar, I’m always found in the kitchen. Kids, demand your ball back with all your might. Kids, demand your ball back with all your might. Oh, why... Why did you take away... the children’s precious toy? Why did you take away... the children’s precious toy? They will pray for you, if you just return their ball. I don’t need blessings from these scoundrels. Keep these wretched brats away from me. Every day they make such noise, sometimes outdoors, sometimes indoors, And now they start crying and drive me crazy. Allah! Your kids are all tricksters! Your kids. Oh, your kids. Your kids. Oh, your kids. Why do you talk bad about them? My kids are so sincere, my kids. - My kids. Oh, my kids. - Your kids? Oh, your kids. - My kids. Oh, my kids. - Your kids? Oh, your kids. - Yes, my kids! Oh, my kids! - Your kids! - My kids! - Your kids! My kids! Yours. Mine. Yours. Mine. I got the ball! Sing out for peace! Blessed peace! Blessed, blessed peace! Peace! Blessed peace! Blessed, blessed peace! Sing it! Welcome, dear Maniklal! Welcome! So here I am. Today the period of grace expires. Either pay me the rent or leave this house immediately. Either pay the rent... - or leave this house? - Yes. In that case, if I have the choice, I’ll... pay the rent. - What? - Here it is. - The entire amount? - Care for some tea? Tea? You couldn’t manage to clear the house? Then tell me, Roopchand, why don’t I just clear out your shop? I’m doomed. Teja darling, careful with your blood pressure. Mr Teja, there’s no need to get so stressed out. Karga runs a gambling den for us in that area. He’ll just gather his men, pay what’s-his-name a visit, beat him and his kids and throw them out. What is the problem? Sir, please just wait for a few days. Why? What will you do? Sir, I’ll make their life so miserable, that they’ll leave voluntarily. And if they don’t move out, I’ll make sure they will starve. Calendar, give us food! Calendar, give us food! Calendar, give us food! Calendar, give us food! Calendar, give us food! Calendar, give us food! Calendar, give us food! Calendar, give us food! Oh, be quiet, children! Cut it out! Why are you raising hell like this? Calendar, we’ll keep on screaming until we get some food! - Right, guys? - Yes! Calendar, give us food! Calendar, give us food! Jugal, you need to curb your attitude. By God, if you instigate people like this, someday you’ll become a leader! - Thank you, Calendar. - Shut up! - But we are hungry. - I don’t have ten hands. It takes time to cook, you know. Komi, follow me to the kitchen and help me out. Behave yourselves! “Behave yourselves!” Just look at this. See? All the flour and rice is gone. How do I explain this to you kids? - Are you sure there isn’t anything? - You can see these empty tins, can’t you? By God, I can’t bear to see you kids suffer like this! But there’s nothing to be done about it until Arun returns. Calendar, surely we can stay hungry for one more day. Why don’t you get some grain from Roopchand’s shop? I went there this morning, but only Arun can convince him. We won’t die if we don’t eat for one day. And if I do die? Tina, we’ll have lots of goodies when Arun returns. Okay? Okay. Arun... Arun, I’m not going to die. If I don’t eat for one day, I won’t die. - You didn’t have any food? - Calendar didn’t give us any. Calendar? Calendar? Calendar, what’s going on? Why haven’t you given them any food? I couldn’t help it, Arun. I tried to get some groceries from Roopchand, - but he... - And he wanted money? Don’t worry, children. I have the money. I’ve received my tuition fee. Just wait fifteen minutes. I’ll go and get lots of yummy things. Okay? Huh? What do you mean? What sin have I committed? I’m running a business, not some charity! You want something? Then pay up and take the groceries. - I’ve got the money. Here. - I’m doomed. I’ve always paid you, albeit somewhat late. But the children were hungry because I wasn’t home. - It’s the entire sum. - So it is. That clears our account to date. Thank you very much. - What are you waiting for? Get lost! - Give me the ration. - You got the money for it? - But I just cleared my loan. So you could take credit again? I want cash, or I won’t give you one single grain! Roopchand, please don’t be that way. The kids are starving at home. Well, let them die today instead of tomorrow! Kids of swines! - Roopchand! - Help! Guys! Help me! He’s going crazy! If you hurt my kids, I’ll hurt you! Throw him out! Bastard!! Strides into my shop as if he owns it! Bloody beggar! Sponges off me for years and then dares to attack me! I’ve never turned you down before, but I don’t have any cash today. This is the problem with employing the unemployed! Take your violin and leave. We don’t want your tuitions! Leave the car here. I’ll pay you if it gets sold. Arun hasn’t returned yet. Be patient. I’m sure he’s on his way. You can trust Arun. Really. The fairy wielded her magic wand and the door opened. You know what happened afterwards? The fairy took the prince... I don’t want to hear this story. I’m hungry. Tina, don’t start again. Arun will... Arun, I’m hungry. Tina, then the fairy flew with the prince. The went all the way up to the stars. Then she hid behind the moon. Then it started raining. It rained heavily. Then, there was a loud noise. And then... then she got scared. So scared, that... that... Arun, we aren’t that hungry. - We aren’t hungry, Arun. - Really, Arun, we aren’t that hungry. Arun, even I am not that hungry. I promise you, Arun, we’re not that hungry. I’ve failed you today. I spent my entire childhood without my parents. Alone, with no support. I brought you to this house, one by one, so that you didn’t have to experience the hardship that I have. So that I could give you the joys I never got. But today I could do nothing. I have failed! I have failed you! While sorrow hovers over our life, we must deploy a smile. We must deploy a smile. Let the shining hope in our hearts brighten our eyes every day. For today’s loss will be tomorrow’s gain. Fortune changes in no time. Time is like a friend, you know. That’s just the way life is. That’s just the way life is – you win only after you’ve lost. That’s just the way life is – you win only after you’ve lost. Calendar? Calendar? - Yes, madam? - Why is everyone so quiet today? Why do the children keep silent? They haven’t eaten for two days. What noise does madam expect them to make? Good morning. Good morning. You have a day off on Sunday. I also have a day off. Why not give our war a break? I thought we’d have a picnic here. Let me tell you this: you don’t sound nice when you’re quiet. Not half as nice as when you make noise. All right, you can make noise later. First, let’s eat. I’m very hungry. So what do you want to eat? Chips? Samosa’s? Pastries? Chocolates? Tina, what will you have? Let’s start with... Samosa’s. Here, have some. Come on. I’d like us to be friends. Say, Tina, will you be my friend? Yes. Serve everybody and me too. I’m really terribly hungry! I gave you a three months advance, but I love this place. I love the balcony and the garden. And the sea beyond. So if you want, you can have a six months advance. But if that football ever hits me on the face again, I’ll never give it back. Got that? Daaga and Teja. They were supposed to become the ministers of my future kingdom! But they prove to be entirely useless and shameless! They still haven’t succeeded in securing a location from which I can send my weapons to India. But, Mr Mogambo, the thing is... Mogambo doesn’t need your petty excuses. He only want victory, order, and a kingdom of his own! Mogambo’s plans are reaching the stars! But you... You’ll get your place on the coast, or Bombay shall be destroyed. Mogambo is pleased. Ouch! You’ll crack my skull! Be careful, I might get hurt. Who are you? What do you want? Calendar... Don’t you dare touch the children! Get your hands off the kids! Calendar! Let me go! Don’t touch my kids! Please don’t hit him. Please. Arun! Let my children go! - Now you are really doomed. - My children... My children... Welcome, Mr Daaga. Welcome, Mr Teja. Please come in. So this is the guy? Whatever your name is, listen up: you will leave this house within two days. It’s best he leaves town. This bastard is telling everyone that half our grain is stones. Really? All these joints and all these men belong to us. If we ever hear you speak badly about them again, we’ll cut out your tongue! Got it? Let’s go, Mr Teja. Two days! Arun, please get up, Arun. Please, Arun. Uncle, those were very dangerous men. I knew that Arun was worried, but I didn’t know he had made enemies with gangsters. I’m glad you informed me. Tell Arun to meet me. I might be able to help. Now go home. I have some work to do. Take care, kid. Is that Sinha? Stop the car! That’s professor Sinha. Turn the car around. Back up... Come on, back up! Go on! Go on! It is Sinha! Get him! Hurry! Let’s go, man! What are you doing? Hurry up! - Sir, can I make a phone call? - Sure, but where? - To the press. - I mean, from where? Which phone? Well, that one. That’s no phone, that’s a radio. Either you get a wrong number, or you get to hear cross connections. - It’s a whole bloody reality show! - A reality show? Yes! Sometimes you hear women complaining about their mothers-in-law, or businessmen discuss the exchange rate for turmeric, or couples exchange hot, steamy, passionate love talk! But go ahead and try. - Hello? - Yes, Mr Daaga. What do you need? Gold? Silver? Pistols? Rifles? Bombs? Hand grenades? Thank you, Mr Wolcott. Come visit us this evening. We’ll discuss this and entertain you. - What entertainment? - D’you know the famous dancer Hawahawai? Mr Wolcott, she’ll be performing for us, this evening. - Miss Hawahawai! I’ve heard of her. - Of course, she’s very famous. - So come on over. You see her, then. - What’s the address? Powai Lake, bungalow number 24. - Number 24? - Right. Hawa... hawai... Hey Arun, good thing I run into you. I have a letter for you. A letter from doctor Sinha? Arun, I’m going away on a long journey. But before I leave, I want reveal the secret I never got to tell you. When your father died... The electricity went out. Whoever wears this gadget and switches on the button, will become invisible. The wearer can only be seen in the light of a red lamp. The gadget has no effect on the colour red. Otherwise, in any clothes or colour, the moment you switch the gadget on, the wearer will be fully invisible, and no eye will be able to perceive him. What do you say, Jugal? What should we do with this? Dr Sinha spoke the truth. You read it yourself. Should I wear it? Yes. - Shall I switch it on? - Yes. Arun, the light... Arun? Arun, where are you? I’m here, Jugal. I don’t see you. Where are you? - You really cannot see me? - No. - Not at all? - No. I can barely believe it, Jugal, but I think really am invisible! Hey, Jugal! I don’t even appear in the mirror! Come and see! Yes, I can see that, Arun. But how will you return? - Well, shall I press the button again? - Yeah. Hey! Hey! Arun, you have returned! I have come back! Arun, first I couldn’t see you, but now I can. - This is wonderful! - Yes, isn’t it? - Say, Jugal, shall I vanish again? - Yes... No-no-no-no! Arun, please come back! I’m so scared. Please come back! You see? I’m back again! I’m back! Just like that, I’m back! - Shall I vanish again? - Yes! Oh, come back, my dear brother! Please! Jugal, what’s going on here? What’s going on? This is madness! This is madness, Jugal! Stop that! I’ll fall! Please, stop it! Please! Please! Arun, put me down! I don’t want to fall! I won’t talk to you if you keep doing that! Then I’ll just vanish forever! Listen, Jugal, look behind you. There are some pieces of red glass lying there. Pick up one of the shards. Look through it at me. But... But now I can see you through the red glass! - And now? - Now I don’t see you. - Can you see me now? - Yes, I see you. “Arun, beware of the colour red.” I’ll stay away from colour red, but that Daaga and Teja won’t escape from me! Good! Very good! Ah, Miss Hawahawai! Please come in. Hello! You... - You Mr Dhaga? - No, not Dhaga. It’s Daaga! Daaga! - This is Mr Teja. - Bheja! Funny name. - Teja. - Bheja? - Teja. - Bheja, right? Miss Hawahawai, tonight we have a special guest – Mr Wolcott. - We’d like you to entertain him. - Oh, really? I don’t mind. Uhm, but costume change, I need boogaloo. - Loo? - No, loom. Loom. - Room! - Yeah! Uhm, Gavin, show madam to the dressing room. Thank you, Mr Bheja. - Have a banana. - Teja. Bheja, right. Mr Daaga, why does she keep calling me Bheja? - Your room, madam. - Wow! Thank you. Thank you! Don’t worry, Mr Daaga. I’ll give you as much gold as you want. Good. Or I can provide you with guns and drugs. Excellent, Mr Wolcott, we’ll take the gold, the drugs, and the guns. - But I want one thing in return. - And what’s that? - A golden Hanuman. - Show me that. - You recognise it? - This statue? - It’s in the main temple in the city. - It has a high value in our country. Mr Wolcott, we will get it for you. We’ll make all the arrangements. Where did Mr Daaga go? Mr Daaga? Hawahawai! Hawahawai! I’m the princess of dreams, I conquer every heart! Oh, I’m the princess of dreams, I conquer every heart! My tresses are like thunderclouds and my glances are like lightning! I’m here to strike you all with my lightening. I’m here to strike you all with my lightening. That is why they call me... Hawahawai! Hawahawai! Hawahawai, Hawahawai! I’m here to strike you all with my lightening. Oh, I’m here to strike you all with my lightening. That is why they call me... Hawahawai! Hawahawai! Hawahawai, Hawahawai! Get this clear, you fools: don’t take me for a fool. I’m the queen of snakes, my bite spells only death, I snatch pearls from the seas and light from lamps. I make fire from stones and steal your deepest secrets. Yes, your deepest secrets. I unravel all your mysteries. Oh, I unravel all your mysteries. That’s why the call me... Hawahawai! Hawahawai! Hawahawai, Hawahawai! I’m here to strike you all with my lightening. That’s why the call me... Hawahawai! I’ll tell you astonishing stories, so listen to me, foolish lover! Let me create a storm in your heart, come, let me make you lose your mind. In my eyes you’ll find magic, in my breath perfume of flower. When my body sways like this, nobody is spared. My face is unparalleled. Oh, my face is unparalleled. That is why they call me... Hawahawai! Hawahawai! Hawahawai, Hawahawai! I’m here to strike you all with my lightening. Oh, I’m here to strike you all with my lightening. That is why they call me... Hawahawai! Hawahawai! Hawahawai, Hawahawai! Hawahawai! Hawahawai! Hawahawai! Hawahawai! Who are you? Who are you? Well, she can be anyone – a police informer, CID agent, or a spy of our enemy! Still, whoever she is, she will tell us. Johnny! There is a soft leather whip in the outside room. Get it! Did you hear that sound? Now this whip will hear your screams. Why did you come here? What were you looking for? Don’t worry, you’ll find out. I’ll tell you everything. We’re in the smuggling business, we run gambling dens, deal in drugs, arms sale – anything you can think of. Now, before you die, you will tell us who sent you here. I see. This whip will loosen your tongue a bit. I’m about to faint. Hands off! Never mind. I’ll teach Miss Hawahawai a lesson. Mr Daaga? What’s going on, Mr Daaga? Mr Daaga, try to grab it slowly. Huh? Just reach and grab it slowly. Do you see that? That’s my whip! My own! Who slapped me? Who is hitting me? Who? So, Mr Teja... What did the girl tell you? Who is she? Who sent her? Mr Daaga, what are you doing? Somebody is punching me. What nonsense! You’ve had too much to drink. Who wants to slap you? - There’s nobody here. - Somebody... Mr Teja, it’s the bottle talking. Girl... Cheers! Mr Daaga! - Mr Daaga! - I’m here. - Somebody punched me! - You too? - Why don’t I just shoot both of you? - What are you? Who are you? What are you? Where are you? I’m no ghost, nor a shadow or spirit. I am a victim of the cruel deeds from men like you. I’m an ordinary Indian. My name is Mr India. Mr India? Oh, my God! This is front page news! Mr India, if you’re an ordinary Indian, then why can’t we see you? Because your eyes are filled with greed. Up until today you have never looked at an ordinary man. So how could you see him now? What do you want, Mr India? I want to make something clear. If you try to remove those children from their home, I’ll remove you from this world! Excuse me, Mr India... I’d like to ask you some questions. Pen, pen, pen... One minute. Excuse me. - Mr India? - I am here. Were you invisible from childhood? Since when are you in this not-to-be-seen profession? You know what I mean? Would you like to give a message to our readers? - Miss Hawahawai, you forget where you are. - Where? Oh, my God! You’re right! Mr India, these men... - Don’t be scared. I’ll save you. - Oh, thanks a lot. Daaga and Teja, this is my first and last warning to you! I won’t even look at them! It’s a matter of the whole nation, not just one person. Until yesterday you were destroying the economy with your cruelty and violence, But the cup of your savagery and crime is now brimming! You will pay for each of your sins! This is not a hollow threat, but a promise by Mr India! - Let’s go, madam. Enough for today. - Okay. Mr India? Mr India? Mr... India? Why do you look so worried? This is great news! Because, if there is a Mr India, it means that the formula Mogambo was looking for, sooner or later, will be in Mogambo’s hands! Mr India. Mr India? What is he, a body builder? Oh, sir, you don’t understand. Mr India is an amazing man. - He cannot be seen. - He what? Yes, he cannot be seen. Well, where does he vanish? Malhotra also is nowhere to be found. Does he want his job or not? Hello? Yes? Fire brigade? No, sir. Sir, Mr India is invisible. He can be in front of you, but you won’t be able to see him. You can hear his voice, though. If he’d pick up a pen, you’d see it write, but not his hand. I’ve seen him with my own eyes. I mean, I haven’t seen... Seen him... Sir, you understand, don’t you? Invisible... Seema, you haven’t taken leave for a very long time. You need the rest badly. - No problem. Go ahead. - You think I’m crazy? There’ll be chaos when his interview is printed on the front page! Say what? In my paper? On the front page? An interview with Mr India who cannot be seen? Sir, you weren’t here, so I gave it to the press. Oh, God! You’ll close down my paper with your trash! - What do you mean? My writing is trash? - Of course it is! You are fired, madam! You are fired! - You just lost your job! - You’re not going to believe me? Just like that invisible Mr India, you’ll become Miss India and vanish. Out! - Go! Go! - All right, I’m going! Sorry, madam. - Malhotra... - Yes? Go after that lady and stop what she has written from being printed. - Go! Go! - Okay, sir. Hello? Yes? Yes? Yes, you’ve dialled the correct number. This is a mental hospital! Send all your family members who are crazy; I’ll make them crime reporters! My editor says I’m crazy! But those who don’t believe me are crazy! I’m telling all of you, Mr India exists! Mr India exists! “Mr India exists! Mr India exists!” - Yes, Mr India exists! - But why have you brought us here? Because Mr India is going to arrive here shortly. - Mr India is coming here? - Yes, Mr India is coming here. Nobody is willing to believe me. I even told Arun. Even he doesn’t believe me. Arun, Mr India exists! Mr India exists! Mr India exists! He won’t even know who Mr India is. Then why don’t you tell me who this Mr India is. He is a friend of the weak; an enemy of the wicked. He says, in this world... But why are you asking? You don’t believe he exists. You didn’t want to come here. Then why have you come now? I thought Mr India wouldn’t show up, so I might as well. Look, I wasn’t even talking to you. You poked your nose in and... Are you kidding me? You complain if we don’t talk about Mr India, and you also complain if we do talk about him! What do you want me to do? Do whatever you want, but leave me alone. - She is leaving! - She is furious! Go after her! Wait here, kids. Madam! Wait up! Madam! Madam, please... Please don’t be angry with me, I mean you well. Just forget about this Mr India. How can you trust a man who can’t be seen? - I fully trust him. - Is he so important to you? He must have brainwashed you! Take me to him, and I’ll show him! - So that’s it. - What? Now I know why you hate him. - And why is that? - You’re jealous. - Why should I be jealous? - Because... - You know why. - I know? What do I know? I’m so in love with Mr India. I wish to meet Mr India a hundred times. I’m so in love with Mr India. I wish to meet Mr India a hundred times. How will you meet a guy who can’t be seen? The poor guy can only be heard. What is the big deal with this Mr India? I’m so in love with Mr India. I wish to meet Mr India a hundred times. I’m so in love with Mr India. I wish to meet Mr India a hundred times. What kind of spell did he put on me? What kind of spell did he put on me? Even during the day I dream that I’m in his arms. Even during the day I dream that I’m in his arms. You’re longing in vain for him. I know exactly how that feels. He is gone, and I am here. What is the big deal with this Mr India? I’m so in love with Mr India. I wish to meet Mr India a hundred times. He is the king of my dreams. Silly girl! Come to your senses. He’s so courageous! Someday he’ll bite the dust. He’s beyond compare! Don’t put him on a pedestal. He’s no ordinary man, I’ll prove it to you, someday. Someday you’ll find out about the greatness of Mr India. There’s no use meeting Mr India. Forget about meeting Mr India. There’s no use meeting Mr India. Forget about meeting Mr India. I’m so in love with Mr India. I wish to meet Mr India a hundred times. I’m so in love with Mr India. I wish to meet Mr India a hundred times. Arun, someone’s drowning! Could it be Mr India? No, you wouldn’t see that. I’m coming! - Arun! - Tina! Put him here. He’s saved. It’s Baburam! I know suicide is cowardice... but I had no other choice, sir. My daughter’s wedding day is already fixed. The groom’s family are arriving in just four days, sir. I... I scrimped and scrounged to save some money, sir. This money is for my daughter. Wants to get his daughter married! My money! That money is for my daughter’s marriage! Your daughter is our sister. This will be taken care of. You can trust me. Sure, you say you’ll take care of it. but what will you do before evening? - Uhm, I’ll have to think about that. - Think. Think all you want, I’m going to that criminal’s den! If I don’t get Baburam’s money back, my name is not Seema! Auntie, I’ll take you to his den. Okay, let’s go. Good morning, good afternoon, good evening. Hey! - Hey, who are you? - Me? Charlie. - Charlie who? - You don’t know Charlie Chaplin? - How’s silly. Your name? - Dabachaa. - And your name? - My name is Karga. - Ghurkha? - Karga! Good name. Going for nothing! Take it all! No fights, please. Miss Seema, that guy is watching us. Now we’ll have to play to save our skin. There, not here. 50 bucks on number 7. Come on! And the number is... Number 3. No, number 7! Seven! My lucky number! Money, money. Money, please. Money... - Pick another number! - Number 5. Excuse me. Excuse me, number 5. Five! Five! Number 5! Number 5? What? Excuse me. I think my 200 became 2,000. Thank you. Tough luck. Anybody else wanna try? Excuse me. Excuse me. 2,000 on number 4. - 2,000 on 4? - That’s right. Number 4? Hey! Out of my way! Let me through! - Hey, on what number did she bet? - Number 4. Hey, you bet all on number 4. Your money is gone! Number 4! That’s 20,000 out of 2,000! Money, please. Money, money... Money, please. Hey! Don’t give it to them! I think you cheated! - What are you saying? - What? Charlie... And cheating? Oh, what’s going on here? Okay... Okay, Mr Ghurkha, I’ll throw again! You just stay right here! Okay? Can you believe this guy? Here! Throw it! - Number 4. - Right. Throw it. Throw it, boss. - Hey! - What? You’ll aim at number 7! Number 7! All right, seven! My lucky number 7. - Right! - Fine. My 20,000. Hey! Catch those cheats! Don’t let them escape! Oh, no! My money! Get them! Catch those weasels! Yay! It’s Mr India! You can put me down, now. You bastard! - Let’s go. Let’s go. - This way. This way. Let’s take that bus, over there. - Good evening. - Good evening. Here’s your money, Baburam. All of it. Give your daughter a grand wedding. - How can I ever thank you? - Thank Mr India. It’s his doing. You’re too modest. She risked her life and gambled. And now she gives all credit to some Mr India! - Did you really need to tell him that? - No, not really, but... - Anyway, goodbye. - Goodbye. Goodbye, ladies. Goodbye. Goodbye. Bye. Well done, Seema. Mr India? Seema, what you did for Baburam’s family, impressed me very much. Thank you. Thank you, Mr India. But if you hadn’t come to Karga’s den, I’d have a serious problem. You shan’t have to face anymore problems while I’m around, dear Seema. So sweet of you. I heard your editor fired you. Editor? Don’t even mention that man! What does he think of himself? - Seema, don’t worry. - And why not? He thinks I’ve gone crazy! He refuses to believe that you actually exist. Tell him I’ll meet him in his office, tomorrow at 5.30. - Promise? - Promise. Hello? Hello? No. No-no. Sorry, wrong number. This is not a clinic. Goodbye. So you mean to say that the door will swing open at 5.30, and that somebody, this Mr India, will enter the room? The chair will move behind on its own, he will sit down, and a voice will be saying, “Hello, Mr Gaitonde. How are you?” And I’ll say, “Hello, Mr India, have a cigar.” The cigar will rise in the air and then starts smoking. - It’s possible. - Quite possible. Then your dream will stop, and you’ll wake up in your bed! Hello, Seema. Hello, Mr India. Hello, Mr Gaitonde. How are you? I’m... I’m fine... I’m actually fine... sir. Thank you. - Why do you seem so shocked? - It’s... nothing at all. Actually... no-no, it’s nothing. Seema, the strange thing is, I can’t see him. And he asks me why I’m shocked! Cigar, Mr India? Thank you, Seema. Mr Editor, do you have a match or a lighter? Yes... yes, I got a lighter. Sorry... very sorry, sir. Thank you. Mr Editor... I’ve heard you’ve fired Seema. Is that true? No-no! No-no! Whoever told you? I would never do that! Seema, please explain to him that our staff is... it’s like... like a family. Or like a small family. We don’t do such things as firing. We live in perfect harmony and very lovable with each other! Why would I fire her? It’s her own paper. Why would you have to ask me? You may interview him and print it. Actually, I hadn’t seen you yet, but now that I’ve seen you... haven’t seen you... now I know you cannot be seen. Mr Editor, a phone call for you. All right, Mr Gaitonde, I must leave now. - Okay, bye, Seema. - Bye, Mr India. I’ll see you tomorrow at 7.30. Okay. - You’re still holding the phone, sir. - Pardon? - The phone. In your hand. - Thanks. Hello? Hello? Hello?! What’s happening, Seema? I cannot hear the phone and I cannot hear him... I mean... What is this? No! Don’t take away my baby! - Stop them! - Enough! How much will you cry? Whatever did my baby do wrong? What did he do wrong? Why did this happen? Why did this happen? The poor thing has gone mad from grief. I saw her son just this morning, playing outside. - What happened so suddenly? - He came home, ate his lunch and died. Countless people are dying every day because of adulterated food. Leave me! Let go! It’s all in the papers. It’s happening everywhere. Goodness... What kind of scum deals in such adulteration? Whoever they are, I promise you this: they shall pay for their crimes! - My children are starving! - Get lost! - How they pester us! - Sir, please... Anything else, sir? Ask madam. Neelam darling, anything else? No, nothing. You know I’m on a diet. You know how little I eat. You know, people tell me that India is short on food. Well, let them come and see the riches on this table. Fantastic food! Here, my dear Teja, have some soup, please. I would even drink poison if you would ask me to. How sweet! What are you doing? I’m so sorry, dear Teja. It’s all right. All right. But, honey, I don’t know, my hand... this spoon... in your ear? Darling, I don’t eat with my ears. Never. I’m sorry. But now I must feed my little Teja. What’s going on? I’m losing it! I’m going mad! Can I help you, sir? No, we were just talking. You may go. Neelam, are you all right? Teja, believe me. Both the times I felt someone holding my hand. Damn! I got it! Let’s get out of here! Sit down, Teja. You’ll leave only after you’ve finished your dinner. - No, no! - You’re not going anywhere, madam. You’ll keep on feeding Mr Teja with your pretty little hands. Mr Teja, I’ve brought you your dinner. These are the white stones you mix in the rice. And these black ones from the lentils. And these brown ones from the wheat. Mr Teja, this will be your dinner, tonight. And madam will feed you with a silver spoon. Begin, madam. Come on. - Pick up the spoon! - Okay. - Dear Teja... - Open your mouth, Mr Teja! Please... I’m sorry. Now feed Mr Teja the lentils. Very good. Mr Teja, open wide. Mr Teja, you’ll be glad to hear that I have the addresses of all your joints. Keep chewing! Mr Teja, the police are raiding all your warehouses, as we speak. You are ruined! - Who are you? - I am an Indian, one that knows how it is to be hungry. Long live Mr India! Long live Mr India! Long live Mr India! Such glorious rallies were held in all the major cities. A source from the government said that today Mr India helped confiscate illegal arms and roll up warehouses with adulterated grain. He also provided the government with good advice. But still nothing can be said about the identity of Mr India. The opposition demanded that all information about Mr India be placed before the house. Arun, I know who he is. - Who is it? - My classmates say he’s in the army. - The army? - Yes! That is why he is fighting the enemies of the nation. Not true! Arun, I know who he is. My teacher says he’s a doctor. A doctor? Yes, that is why he got the warehouses of adulterated grain raided. That’s enough, Arun! Let’s switch off the TV and get out of her room. If she returns and catches us all still up, we’ll be in big trouble. But how could she come now? This evening, she... I forgot all about it! Mr India? You feel such love for the people. For the people? And for you? I wouldn’t know. You never spoke about that. Does it need to be said in words? No. Some matters are best told through the eyes. But that too would be impossible. That which you haven’t heard or saw until today – what if I came close to you and whispered that in your ear? Very close to you... Touching you... Taking you in my arms... I’ll say it so that you can hear it with your lips and not your ears. I love you... Days and nights won’t pass, even though I want them to. I long to express my heart to you. Days and nights won’t pass, even though I want them to. I long to express my heart to you. So tonight I’ll say to you... I love you! I love you! I love you! I love you! I love you! There is no one else about, it is just you and me. There is no one else about, it is just you and me. So tonight I’ll say to you... I love you! I love you! I love you! I love you! I love you! - This breeze... - So strong, so strong... - This night... - So fresh, so fresh... - This breeze... - So strong, so strong... - This night... - So fresh, so fresh... - This ambience... - So new, so new... - The heart beckons... - “My beloved”. - This ambience... - So new, so new... - The heart beckons... - “My beloved”. My beloved... My beloved... My beloved... When you recline and stretch your body, you put me in a trance. When you recline and stretch your body, you put me in a trance. So tonight I’ll say to you... I love you! I love you! I love you! I love you! I love you! - So fragrant... - Your body is... - So ecstatic... - My heart is... - So fragrant... - Your body is... - So ecstatic... - My heart is... - So overwhelming... - Your beauty is... - So strong... - This ecstasy... - So overwhelming... - Your beauty is... - So strong... - This ecstasy... This ecstasy! This ecstasy! This ecstasy! With you alone beside me, I long to express my heart to you. With you alone beside me, I long to express my heart to you. So tonight I’ll say to you... I love you! I love you! I love you! I love you! I love you! Days and nights won’t pass, even though I want them to. I long to express my heart to you. There is no one else about, It is just you and me. So tonight I’ll say to you... I love you! I love you! I love you! I love you! I love you! Tongue. Teeth. I broke one. Next, next. Nails. Teeth. Next. Come, Tina. Tongue. Teeth. Nails. Back of the palm, not the front. What? You haven’t cut your nails? I have... - but they grew back. - They did? Cut her nails. - Nails. - Arun! Arun! Have you heard? Bajrangbali has been stolen from the temple! By God, who would do such a thing? I know who. That bigshot businessman, Daaga, must have stolen it. Where could Mr India be, now? Fantastic! Fantastic! You got what you wanted, Mr Wolcott. - In return, we’re going to need... - You’ll get it! Johnny! Good. Very good. We’ll store all this in the basement. I’ll take Hanuman out of India in my private plane. That’s excellent. Soon Indians won’t need a temple or an altar to worship, nor a god or goddess to pray to. For the day is near, Mr Wolcott, when these 800 million human beings bow... only to Mogambo! And us! And to us! The lives and death, the entire fate of all Indians... will be in our hands! And all of India will only pray to us! We! We, Mr Wolcott, shall be the new gods of this nation! Indian god beats. You shameless fool! Not only are you trying to sell these blessed idols to foreigners, you also inject your venomous greed into the lives of poor Indians! If you had your way, you’d sell their lives, souls, everything! I won’t let this happen! It also laughs! Wait, wait! You’re my Hanuman! You want to be the new god of this country? Yes. - Huh? - No! - You are a devil, not a god, Daaga! - No! - A devil! - No. - A traitor! - No! Oh, good God... At last you call me a god! What am I? You’re a mighty god! You’re a mighty god! And you, Englishman! Where do you think you’re going? I didn’t realise you were holy to the Indians. I’m... I’m a donkey! A donkey! A fool! You are a god. I know that now. So, will you be stealing any other idols? No, I won’t, Bajrangbali! What happened, divine one? Is Hanuman angry? Will you be selling guns to these traitors? No, Bajrangbali! Hail Bajrangbali! Hail Bajrangbali! Hail Bajrangbali! Hail Bajrangbali! Hail Bajrangbali! Hail Bajrangbali! Hail Bajrangbali! Sorry, Bajrangbali! No, Bajrangbali! Oh, my Bajra... Say with me, Mr Wolcott, “Hail Bajrangbali!” - What do I say? - “Hail Bajrangbali!” Hail Bajrangbali? - Yes! - Ah! Hail Bajrangbali! - Say it again! - Hail Bajrangbali! - Louder! - Hail Bajrangbali! - From your heart! - Hail Bajrangbali! Sir, there’s the idol of Hanuman. It’s over there. So it is! Drugs? My God! Bombs? This is nothing, officer. Search this house, and you’ll find an entire gang with plans to destroy India. - Mr India? - That’s me. I’m the one who called you. Thank you very much, Mr India. Thank you. No thanks, officer. I’m not done yet. My work is still unfinished. It will only be complete when India’s archenemy, Mogambo, meets his end. Daaga and Teja, does Mr India think he’s India’s protector by defeating you? Does he really think he is a match for me? Me? Mogambo? And all these foolish Indians! Let’s see if Mr India succeeds in saving them from this! Captain Zorro! All over India, in all cities, market places, on all roads, bombs shall go off! Bombs in transistor radios, in books, in toys! Create total mayhem, so that no man dares to leave his house! For it might be his last step! Round and round! Hold tight! Don’t fall off! Arun, put me down. I want to go over there. Go ahead. But careful. Komi? - Hey, Tina! - Tina! Komi, what is that? Komi? Komi, what is that? Tina! Hurry! Hurry up! Out of the way! Out of the way, please! Tina... Tina... Tina, you’re going to be okay. I’m here with you. We’re all with you. Out of the way! Doctor! Doctor, our Tina is hurt! - Prepare for operating. - Okay, doctor. - Get the glucose, fast. - Okay. Tina... Tina... Tina... A butterfly has flown away. I wonder where to it has gone. A butterfly has flown away. I wonder where to it has gone. Why has this ray of sun faded in the middle of the day? In every eye there is a tear, in every mind there is a memory of you. You are no more, yet your love remains. That’s just the way life is. You are no more, yet your love remains. That’s just the way life is. Mr India may try all he wants, but he cannot change the fate of India! Hail Mogambo! India is destined to be enslaved by Mogambo! But first it needs to be destroyed. Hail Mogambo! Dr Watson, are the missiles ready to attack India? Yes, Mr Mogambo. We’re only waiting for your orders. Dr Watson, Mogambo wishes to see his missiles for himself. These buttons will get the missiles out of the underground bunkers. Mogambo is pleased. Dr Watson... Proceed! This button will start the countdown. The missiles will then be ready for take-off, sir. Dr Watson, press the button. - But, sir... - Dr Watson, press the button! Sixty seconds after the countdown begins, there will be a blast, And the missiles will take off. They can be stopped up to twenty seconds before that – if you cancel lift off after that, there will be an earthquake here. The missiles will explode here, and this island will burn to ashes! - And if you do not cancel... - ...these missiles will take off. They shall be unleashed to destroy countless cities in India! - Indian cities will be in ruins! - Mr India too will die with them. But, Mr Mogambo, then Mr India will die with them as well. And then we can forget about finding that formula... Dr Fu Manchu... You are a fool. Why do you think Mogambo hasn’t yet fired these missiles at India? Captain Zorro, according to our computer Mr India loves the entire nation. Especially those orphan children – the ones that live with that worthless violin player. You know what needs to be done. Put them all in the car! Let’s go! Get them! Hail Mogambo! Hail Mogambo! Hail Mogambo! Hail Mogambo! So these are the worms that Mr India loves so much? If you value your lives... you’ll tell me who Mr India is and where he can be found. If you refuse to answer me, I’ll throw all of you into this acid pool! Your bones will melt in it! Captain Zorro, take the kids, one by one. Leave him be, Mogambo! Mogambo, they don’t know anything! - Arun! - Mogambo! I am Mr India! I am Mr India, Mogambo! I am Mr India! No, Mr Mogambo, he’s lying. Just to save himself and the kids. He’s just an ordinary man. I slapped him around in his house, and he did nothing against it. He can’t be Mr India! Silence! So you are Mr India? Then let’s see you disappear. Untie my hands and I will show you. You cannot fool Mogambo. Take them away and lock them up! Mogambo... Mogambo, listen to me, Mogambo! Seema, could you please get rid of these handcuffs? Did you really think we could get out of here by lying? You thought that wise? Untie my hands. I’m not lying. I am Mr India. Look... Where is it? - So you’re Mr India? - Yes. Arun... How I wish Mr India would really come. There’s no other Mr India but me, Seema! Jugal, how can I explain to them? I’m telling you the truth, children. Don’t be under false hopes that Mr India will come to save you. Because I am Mr India! But... but I don’t have any proof, so nobody will believe me. I believe you, Arun! You are Mr India! I believe it too, Arun! You are Mr India! - Me too. - Me too. - Me too. - We know you would never lie. Madam, don’t expect anyone. - Ronnie, what’s that around your neck? - It’s a magnet. Remove your belts. The day of Mogambo’s coronation is nigh! Captain Zorro, fetch my crown! Arun, where could that bracelet have gone? I think I remember now, Jugal. When I smashed into that trolley, it must have fallen off onto it. Take the crown to Mr Mogambo. Arun, try again. Quick! Quick! Let’s go! Let’s go! Hurry up. Let’s go, madam. Let’s get out of here. Quick, get cover! - Hail Mogambo! - Hail Mogambo! Hail Mogambo! Hail Mogambo! Calendar, you, the children, and lady will go this way. - What about you? - I’ll get the bracelet. Arun, where will you find it? Where is that trolley? Don’t worry, Jugal. I’ll find it. It must not fall in the wrong hands. They will use it for evil. Go on, I’ll follow. Go, madam. You helped me so many times. Do you really think I’d abandon you now? No, Mr India, I shall do no such thing. - Who are you? - Hail Mogambo! Hello? Hello? Go. I’ll wait here. - Arun! - Why did you come back? We keep moving in circles. By God, I don’t know where I’m going! Go! Hide in here! Quick! Stay in here. Calendar, I’ll come back to get you. What the hell? - What’s this, Calendar? - Calendar, look what I’ve found. What is this? What’s this, Calendar? Cut it out! - What is this, Calendar? - My head! Our lives are at risk! And you keep asking, “what’s this, what’s this?” Fools! What’s this? My name is Calendar. What your name is, please? My loyal men! My devoted subjects! My missiles are ready to attack. Many nations that are enemies of India are ready to support me. Captain Zorro, bring those fans of Mr India to me! Everything is going according to Mogambo wish. Even the invisibility formula, which will provide me complete stealth, will soon be at my feet. - What are you doing here? - Waiting for Seema. Now that she has gone, I have to wait... Calendar, they caught Arun! We’ll have to do something about that! And quick! You, foolish Indian! Did you think you could succeed in escaping Mogambo’s confinement? Where would you go? Soon your whole country will be mine! Your last hour has come, Indian. But before that, it’s the royal tradition that death wishes are granted. Tell me if you have any last wish. Tell me! Tell me. My last wish, Mr Mogambo... is to tell you, before I die, that you have opened my eyes. I want to express this by touching the feet of the great Mogambo. Mogambo is pleased. Just once I wish to fall at your feet and say, “hail Mogambo!” I want to testify Mogambo’s unalienable right to rule over the whole world! Mogambo is pleased. I want to say that death at the feet of the great and noble Mogambo is far better than life! Mogambo... is pleased! Divine Mogambo! My body and my life... I humbly prostrate at your feet. My whole being is at your feet. You see? Now you all see how easily these Indians accept defeat. Today this single Indian, tomorrow all of India will bow before Mogambo! You will see! You all will see! Tomorrow the whole of India will bow at the feet of Mogambo, just like this... Huh? What? Mr India? Mr India? Guards! Mr India is here! Fire! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Fire! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! - Ouch, my hand. - Very good. Mr India! Your game is up! Come out from wherever you are! Or else, the girl... Captain Zorro! Stop! Mr India! The formula... Ah! Miss Hawahawai! What is it? Block all exits! Let nobody escape! Let’s see how Mr India will save them from this! Switch on all red lights! Keep your guns at the ready! I discovered that Mr India can be seen in red light! Mr India, wherever you are, hear this! You’ve just lost your war with Mogambo! I have my finger on the button that will launch the missiles! They will eradicate every corner of India! So it would be best if you’d surrender yourself to us! Mr India, if you don’t surrender to my men within one minute, I shall press this button! Mr India, nobody can save your precious India now! What? Mr India? No, Mogambo! Not Mr India, but an ordinary Indian – one that lives in every part of India, in every house! I am that ordinary Indian. Mogambo, I’ll fight you not as Mr India, but as an ordinary Indian. Because an ordinary Indian is strong enough to defeat you. Then I will crush this ordinary Indian like a worm! Don’t think you’ve won, Mr India. I’ve pressed the button. So, in a few seconds... my missiles will take off to destroy India! No! You can’t do anything now! They have been fixed on target! And if you manage to stop them, the missiles will explode right here! So either save yourself and your children... or save your precious India! The missiles are about to explode! This island will be blown to pieces! Run away! Seema! Seema! Seema. Let’s go! Stay together! Calendar, is everyone all right? Is everyone here? Everyone in the boat! Hurry up! Hail Mogambo! Seema! Seema! Wait, Seema! Wait! Will you finally tell me who and where Mr India is? Sir, meet this gentleman. Perhaps he could tell you... I can meet him later. Please. Come, tell me. All right, if you insist. How are you, sir? Fine. I’m glad to meet you. - Right. Now tell me who Mr India is. - What do you want from Mr India? Please try to understand my problem. He has fixed many great problems; I’m sure he can fix my telephone. I think that’s too difficult even for Mr India. THE END
