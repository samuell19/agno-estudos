( film reel spooling up ) - [Frank Voiceover] I guess most everybody's had some kind of nightmare in his life. I didn't know it at the time, but mine was just beginning. What I did know was that I was sick and I was scared, and I needed some kind of help. Hi, Frank-- Counselor, could you wait please? I don't wanna go in there. Why do I have to go in there? It's a formality, it'll be over in a minute. Wait, you know I'm sick, I know I'm sick. Everybody knows I'm sick. I don't want to go on the stand, just put me away somewhere. Do you want the cuffs off, will that make you feel better? What do you think? Can you take 'em off? No, not out here. We'll take 'em off when we get inside the courtroom. Are we gonna stand up all day or is it possible to sit down? We can sit down. Thanks. Sit down right here. Look Frank, just do me a favor. Relax, okay? [sighs] Is my wife in there? I don't know, I don't think so. Listen, I feel a little jumpy now. And I don't wanna have a breakdown in front of a million people, so why don't we get the judge out here? Will you please just try to calm yourself, Frank? This whole thing will take maybe 15 minutes. It is just a standard hearing. Why don't you answer my questions? Why don't we get the-- Will you listen to me? I told you once before, this is a sanity hearing. Yes. So you can get the help that you need, it's a formality. I'm in precarious shape right now. Right? [sighs] I have people I know in there. If they start laughing at me, I don't know what I'm gonna do. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I don't know what I'm going to say, I can't say anything more to you. I don't write the rules in there. This is a formality, it'll be over in a minute. Okay. Can I go to the bathroom? Sure, let's go. Calling Frank Dole. Frank Dole. [shattering] [grunting and yelling] I'm not going in there! - [Cop] Let's go, Frank. [mumbles] - [Frank] I told you what I want, and I tell what I need. Nobody listens to me, I'm not goin' in that room. Frank, Frank, Frank. If you'll calm down we could just get this over with. [Frank yelling] It's gonna be alright. [yelling] I wanna help you! [yelling] I wanna help you! - [Frank] I know what I need but I don't want to-- [yelling] - [Lawyer] Frank, will you listen? We're going to help you! [yelling] [pensive music] This may be hard to believe but I want this. I know there's something wrong with me and you're taking me to the place I want to go. Take her easy Mr. Dole, everything's going to be alright. I'll tell you something else. If you took these handcuffs off me, stopped the car and got out, I'd get in the driver's seat and take myself there under my own bond. That's right, everything's gonna be fine. How much further is it? Oh it's just a couple miles down the road here. [dramatic music] This is Frank Dole, here's his court order of admission. Thank you. He's all yours. This way Dole, follow me. Hold it right here. This way. We have a court-ordered admission, Frank Dole. You can sit down. Do you know why you're here? Yes. I want you to tell me why you're here. I'm sick and I need to get well. Well that's a good attitude, I must say. Thank you. Can you read this? Yes. Now read it. The patient will be allowed to shave once a week-- That's good, good, great. Look now all you need to know is right here in this book. The schedules, the rules, your introduction to life here. I want you to study it so that you'll know it as well as you know your own name. I will. Good. Tell you what I tell everyone. This is Hillsgate Hospital for the Criminally Insane. Just follow the rules, keep your nose clean, and stay out of deviant groups. Okay, I've never been much for groups. Guard, take Mr. Dole to J ward. Yes sir. This way, Dole. - [Superintendent] You can leave the door open. [clamoring] [buzzes] Okay, I'm coming. Yeah. Mr. Dole. Yeah, I know. Get inside. Wait for me. Follow me. [shouting and clamoring] Here you are, this is it. Wait, hold on. I thought I was gonna be in a hospital. He tore the courthouse apart down at Cortland County. There's nothing to tear apart here, get in. Where's the doctor? I was promised a hospital! Now calm down kid. I'm not going in there. It's only a routine! Get in there, get in there! Get in there! I'm sick and tired of making sense to a [mumbles]! I want what I was promised! I want what I was promised! [shouting and clamoring] Give me what I was promised! [shouting] [tense music] [hyperventilating] Oh god, help me, please god, help me! Help me, please. [buzzes] Hello Mr. Donahue, got a new transfer for you. Frank Dole. They were gonna put him in J ward but they figured he'd be alright with you. Hello Mr. Dole. Shake them, shake those hands. Come on, come on. This is D ward, Mr. Dole, your new home. Have a look around. Shake those hands. [shouting] I'm not supposed to be here! I'm not supposed to be here! I'm not supposed to be here! It ain't the Hilton but it ain't J ward either. Still a disciplinary ward. Get the picture? Alright, back in line. FBI, FBI, FBI. Move. - [Man] Keep moving, keep moving, shake those hands, shake those hands. Hands out in front. Shake 'em out, shake 'em out. Hands up in the air, straight up in the air. Come on, get 'em up. Up in the air, up in the air. Shake 'em, shake 'em. Frank Dole, transfer from J ward. Thank you Mr. Donahue. My name's Johnson with a Mr. in front. I'm a charge guard. Listen I've been here three days and-- Four more besides me will be watching you like the old watch bird. You keep your nose clean you'll do fine. I've been here three days and I haven't seen a doctor yet. Something you better get straight right now. When I talk you don't interrupt. I know how long you been here, I got your records. I read what you done. So don't you try giving me none of your lip, you understand? Yeah. I'd just like very much to see a doctor. You gonna see a doctor alright. You gonna see everybody. [whistle blowing] Alright break it up. [clamoring] [chair squeaks] Hands out in front, shake 'em out, shake 'em out. Hands up in the air, straight up in the air. Up in the air, up in the air. What do you want? Get out of here, get away from me. I want my chair. That's my chair. I'd like my chair, that's my chair. [whistling] Hey, you parked in the man's chair. I want my chair. That's my chair. I use that chair, I look out the window from that chair, it's mine, that's my chair. Hey, did you hear me? You parked in the man's chair. I want my chair. Looks like you lost your throne, pop. No, he has my chair, that's my chair. You ain't looking for another shot, are you? - [Old Man] No, I want my own chair, that's my chair. Well go and get another chair, they all look alike. I don't want another chair, I want that chair. Mr. Baker, you look after the new fish. Yeah alright. Mr. Baker, you heard what I said? Yes Mr. Miller. Well do it now! I want my chair. That's alright, that's alright, relax, relax. Say man, look here. If you wanna survive in here you better give the man back his chair, alright? Hey, hey it don't mean a damn thing to you, do it? Alright Pops. Coming to get the stuff for the new guy. Oh. Hey, hey, come on, gotta go get your stuff. Frank Dole? Yeah. Oh yeah you gotta go around that way. There's a little small window there, just wait there, I'll meet you on the other side. Okay. Dole, Frank. Over here. This it? You needed the guy's chair. One side of the wall. How long have you been here? 11 years, eight months, and some days. I don't count the days no more. You do that when you first get in here. 11 years? Mm hmm. When they gonna let you out? Man I ain't never getting outta here. Nobody ever does. It's a hospital, isn't it? They let you out when you're well. You must not be well yet. Get to shave once a week, shower the same. I tell you this is not what I expected a hospital to be like. You get mail twice a week, coming or going, and don't come and go too fast either 'cause the guards pass it around first. Especially if it's got some juicy hot stuff in it. The guards read your mail? - [Jim] Mm, yeah. Don't worry about it. I don't like that. You'll get used to it. They rotate the guards around too so you get to meet all of them. Then you know which ones to avoid. Listen when do you see a psychiatrist? What psychiatrist? A psychiatrist, I was told that I was gonna get therapy. The only psychiatrist they got in here is the superintendent and he don't see no patients. Wait a minute. I was confused at court but I was told that I was gonna see a doctor, that I was gonna get therapy. My lawyer told me that. Man the only therapy you gonna get in here is boot leather therapy. - [Frank] What's that? You'll know it when it happens. Let me see, yes. That, that, that, okay. Here, sign there. What's your name? Baker, Jim Baker. I been here three days, this is the first conversation I've had with anybody. Sure isn't what I expected it to be like. You scared, huh? Don't be afraid to admit it. Smart to be scared in here. Here you go. Step right along. Come on, come on. Get off! Well who do you think you are, Mary? Mrs. Touchy, huh? Trying to get friendly. Stay away from you. Hang up that phone when you're eating lunch. Hello Mitchell. Well Mitchell that's all, that's all. Let's go, move it. That's all you get, let's go. Hey man what's the hangup here, what's going on? His food is all over the floor. Hey hey, don't worry about it. Hey come on we ain't got but 20 minutes to serve all this. Let's get things going, come on man, move it. You gotta put some on his plate. Hey man he don't eat it no way, he just plays in it okay? That's all you're gonna get Mitchell, that's it. That's it, let's go, let's move it. Come on you guys. You gonna do that to me too? No, no he's not gonna do that with you. Here, I got it. Here, here you go. There's that, and there's that. There, come on, let's go, let's move. Come on Pudge. I'll have some peas. I know what you'll have. Here. Come on sweetheart, come on sweetheart, that's great. Hey come on man I ain't doing all your work for you. Let's move it, come on, let's keep this thing going. [haunting music] - [Donahue] Mitchell, go sit down. I got some meat. You want some meat? Meat, meat. Alright. That's good. Alright. No no no, 50 cents, 50 cents. Could we have the two please Jim? Sure, that'll be 50 cents each or $1 for both of 'em. Well can't we trade? Oh no, you ain't got nothing I want except the money for these sandwiches. Now I got ham and I got cheese. Are you sure darling? Man I was sure the first time you came onto me and I get surer every time I see you. Just the money. You're a vicious, vicious man. Mm hmm, just take the sandwiches and shove off, queen. [chuckling] Well, I'm gonna hit the sack. - [Jim] Okay Carlo, you got one. [chuckling] Guard walks right over and changes the channel. Oh yeah? I was watching the program. Well change it back. My wife and I used to watch that program. You married eh? Yeah. Got two girls, got my own business, body shop. Where you from? East Chester. That's around Cochran County, ain't it? Yeah, you know it? Yeah I been around there once or twice. Used to be a truck driver. They let you have your own business here? Hey around everybody got his own hustle in here. Now you ain't got to buy. Then you get stuck with that slop they serve you down in the mess hall. Where do you get the stuff to make it with? Main dietary. What's that? The kitchen. Best job in here. Get off the ward, get to eat the same food the guards eat. I'll take one of those. Oh you ain't got to pay. You the new guy. First time out you get this one free. After that it's 50 cents. Thanks. Who is this guy? He's been following me around all day. What's his story? Who, Mitch? Oh man he's so full of spark he can't even touch the toilet without help. What does he want from me? I don't know. Maybe you remind him of his brother. What's so funny? Well, it seems that Mitch used to be a butcher. One day he got mad at his brother, killed him, chopped him up in little pieces and put him in the meat grinder and served him for hamburger. [laughs] Come get it Mitch. Boy, that works every time. Boy you fell for that. Mitch wouldn't hurt a fly. Now he's a little weird I gotta admit that. In fact his folks didn't want him around so they brought him in for observation. That was after the war. What are you doing here? You mind me asking? You don't seem sick to me. No, I guess I ain't no more. So what are you doing here? I wasted my old lady. What's that? I killed my wife. Oh yeah, tell me about it. Oh no this is the truth. It was some dumb argument. I didn't even know it until they picked me up. They went to court and some fool public defender convinced me to plead insanity so I would come here instead of going to prison. Stay here for a few years while they found out if I was alright and then got released man that was a long time ago with no getting out in sight. What about you? Yeah I... [sighs] It's alright, I get the picture. I'm a little messed up right now, I'll be the first to admit it, but I'll be okay once I get a little help. Man I'm gonna tell you something right now. I'm gonna tell you something an old dude told me long time ago when I first got here. You ain't getting no help. You got to sort it all out for yourself. Well I can't do that. I mean that's why I'm here in the first place. You ain't got no choice. Well then what's gonna happen to me? Take a look around you. Alright Mitchell, pick it up. I said pick it up! Now clean that damn mess up. [shouting] Come on, turn around. You don't wanna see that and you don't wanna know nothing. Just turn around, come on, look around you. [wailing] Okay. Where are they taking him? We call it the Peanut Room. I ain't never been there but I know I ain't never wanna go. Neither do you. No way. [shouting] Come Dole, in bed right away. Gotta jump right away into bed. Come on, come on Jim hurry it up. Pudgy into your own bed. [shouting] Get rid of the radio right away. Go on, good night, come on, settle down now. Go on, don't let the bed, come on. - [Frank Voiceover] Dear Louise, this is supposed to be a hospital for the sick, but I think it's a prison. [pensive music] Somebody's gotta know about it. I haven't seen a doctor yet. Louise, there are things going on that I don't understand and I have to talk to somebody. There was a man tonight named Mitchell. He was collecting candy and gum wrappers out of the trash cans when the guards beat up on him so horrible and he didn't do anything and I'm scared since I saw it that something's gonna happen to me. Tell somebody about this place, Louise. It must be very hard to believe but I love you very much. Please find some way of helping me, please. Please get me out of here. I am going to be the best patient they ever had. For you, for us, and for little Donna. I love you. Frank. [laughs] Hey that's a crock. What do you think? Burn it. Yeah. I think we got ourselves a first-class troublemaker here. I tell you throw it away and burn it. I don't think so. Not this one. I'm gonna let the front office hassle this one. If they wanna mail that letter, well, that's up to them. Not our business. He's gonna turn it to the governor. So what? Who does he think he is? Frank I'm not in a position to get you out of here. All I am is a minister of the church. I carry very little weight around here. And I'm not a psychiatrist. Well then talk to somebody. I don't belong in here. With all of your talk about suicide last month it's gonna be very difficult to convince anybody of that. I was very depressed. Well a lot of people get depressed but they don't talk about suicide. Listen, I came here for help, I wanted to be here, I looked forward to a hospital and I found out I'm in a prison for the rest of my life. I figure I might as well be dead. But why should I have to explain that to you? I don't have to explain that to anybody. You're right Frank, you don't have to explain that to me. But you do have to explain that to the board if you wanna get out of here. I wanna see the board, I wanna have a meeting with the board. - [Reverend Wyler] Hold on just a minute. You came in here a very sick man. When was it, three months ago? Four. You'd been found breaking into mausoleums and there's a report about you driving a steel rod into the ground by your father's grave. I don't wanna talk about it. Frank. You're going to have to face these things. I'm not a psychiatrist but the one thing I know is that if you're gonna convince that board of anything, you're gonna have to do exactly that. Now listen to what I'm saying and hear it. You must know that you did those things and you must face the reason why. I don't wanna. Well then you're gonna be sick forever. Do you want that? Is it painful to think about these things? Yeah. It's frightening. Yeah. Well it sounds pretty brutal but what you're gonna have to ultimately decide is which is more painful, to think about them or not to think about them. How do you do it? Well to begin you might just sit quietly for a few minutes every day and let your mind go back over what you did, over what happened, and try gently not to block it out. Are you a religious man? No. Well I thought perhaps prayer might, but nevermind. Would you like some reading matter? On what? - [Reverend Wyler] On psychology, on the way the mind works. Guess it wouldn't hurt. Good. You can start with this and read it and we can talk about it again next week if you like. Okay. Thanks. That door is always open, Frank. [door shuts] Hey Dole. I need a favor. Let me have a couple packs of cigarettes at suppertime tonight? What for? You don't smoke. I'm serious. There's gonna be a cock fight in our ward at four o'clock this afternoon. Who said so? I just heard the guards talking about it. You ever see a cock fight, Dole? Nope, but I know what they are. They're great fun man. You can pick yourself up a lot of extras by making bets, guards do it all the time. Listen I never bet on a horse or a dog, I'm sure as hell not gonna bet on a human being. Okay, suit yourself, I thought you'd be interested since Jim is the odds on favorite to win. I'm still not interested. [breathing sharply] Who's the other guy, you seen him? Yeah, I seen him. He's some little muscle head they got all doped up from J ward. You better hold it up if you don't wanna get hurt. [punching] Does this go on a lot? Every time the guards wanna get their kicks. How many times you done it? Hold it up. I really don't like to talk about it. So what are you doing it for? Because in here you do what you have to do and it's as simple as that. Feeling like a champ? Feel alright. Let's do it then, squirrels is getting restless. We got a lot of money riding on you, boy. You don't have to worry. I can't afford to lose a fight in here. You coming? It's not my kind of thing. Where's your pride? This your ward. I want you there. [murmuring] [piano music] Alright let's gather 'round, come on now. Come on now, come on now! These are your weapons, these are your weapons, you'll take these into combat with you. Hey Jim, I've got over two cartons bet on you, you can't lose. I don't know too much about this boy except they say he's one of the best street fighters to ever come out of Chicago. Now he ain't as big as you are so don't put him away too quick, I mean, slap him around and make it look good. Make it look good. Yeah. Now any more of you boys wanna make a bet, get it down now 'cause we're fixing to start. Mr. Stoneman, shut the maestro up there, we don't need no music for this. Wanna sweeten your bet? No I've got enough. Okay boys, let 'er rip. [shouting] [punching] If you can fight your opponent you can beat your opponent. They never give up. You can use your entire body as a weapon. You will use all parts of your body. You will use your head. You will use your elbows... [shouting] You will use your hands to break the bridge of the nose and drive the nose into the brain. That's right son, you're plutonium. [laughing] We win! What's the matter boy? Put the boots to him! You owe me 50 bucks. Yeah, yeah. [groaning] [coughing] Di Salvo? Yeah yeah. Get your boy outta here, will you? I swear to god! How you doing? - [Jim] Man I hurt all over. Can I do something for you? - [Jim] Did you see what they did to me? Yeah. I mean they're the ones that's crazy. I mean did you see what they did to me? Yeah. You want this? [winces] Oh hold it. Wait a minute. I have had it. I mean that's it, I have had it. Man I ain't going through this no more. I hear you're appearing before the tsar's entire court today. Yeah. Well mind your manners. Buzz off. Mr. Donahue, you know what time it is? What? Do you know what time it is? Quarter to. Hurry up. Don't wanna go in there bleeding. I don't wanna be late either. They'll wait. Yeah but it doesn't look good. Nothing's gonna happen anyway, kid. Oh yeah? That's what you think. There you go. Here you go. Hey that's another nickel! What for? It was a rush job, two bits. Let's go, Mr. Dole. One minute. Aren't you gonna wear a shirt? Yeah. Sit down, Mr. Dole. I got Frank Dole here. I'll check on it. Let me get it. No no no no no no no no no no no no no! Calm down! No, no! - [Man] Bring in the next patient. Let's go. [clears throat] Gentlemen, Mr. Dole from D ward. Hello Frank, sit down please. Thank you. Well Frank, how are you? Fine, thank you sir. I see you've been here now about two years. No, 26 months. Two days ago it was 28 months. This is your first real staff evaluation. Excuse me, I had one 10 months ago. Oh yes, I'm sorry, forgot about that. You probably see a lot of people. How do you feel about your last evaluation? Oh, not terribly well. I was under a lot of pressure, guess I wasn't really ready. Frank, are you ready now? Yes sir. I'm doing a lot of work on my head, I really know a lot of things now that I didn't know before. I really feel like I'm ready. How have you been sleeping? Fine, no problem. Frank, I know it's difficult but try to relax. - [Frank] Okay. After all, we're here to help you, aren't we? Frank and I have done a lot of good work together lately. Yes, we have your memos and we also have copies of Frank's letters. Well now Frank, tell us what you've been up to. Well, since you're the superintendent here it's probably all stuff that you're aware of. Yes of course, but we'd like to hear it from you. Right, kinda see where my head is at. Right. Do you know where your head is at, Frank? In the past 10 months I've been mainly into studying. I've been reading just about everything I can get my hands on. Books on psychology, books on all kinds of self help. I've read a couple of things on semantics. I've been meditating and Reverend Wyler has helped me with all of those things. Yes, we're all aware of your efforts there. I've reached the point now where I really feel like I'm doing something constructive with my time. I'm not sitting around moping anymore. And I'm able to face a lot of the things I've done. What I'm really excited about is this. I've instituted some training programs for the inmates. For the patients. Yeah, for the patients. For example, I have this one here on auto body work which was my field before I came here. I have letters of encouragement from people all the way as far as Dadeville, I have from my county corporate-- That's all very interesting but we already have an OT department Frank. No, I'm not talking about occupational therapy. All we've really got is the ceramics shop and the print shop and art and woodworking. Yeah, these are hobbies. What I'm talking about is a career that a man can walk out of this place and go into. I'm afraid we just don't have the budget to implement these ideas. Especially since out of the 1400 men we have here, only five were released last year. And out of those five two are back with us. Well I wouldn't be back. I'm well now and I wanna get outta here and get a job and go back to my wife and kids and make up to them what I owe them. Well I'm sure you do, but what makes you think you're ready for that? Well I just know it. All the things I told you about, all the work I been doing. I'd like to hear something about the discoveries you've been making about yourself. Okay, what would you like to know? Well let's start with your suicide attempts. Do you know what brought that on? Yes I do. [sighs] Everything was crashing in on me, there was a lot of pressure in my head. And I didn't know any way of stopping it. So I finally decided that the only way to stop it was to stop myself from feeling it. And now, do you think of suicide now? No I don't. That was all part of my father's dying the way he did and his last words to me which was the thing that put me right over the edge. One of the police reports states that you went out to the cemetery, that you brought out a long, metal rod and you punched a hole down through the ground next to your father's grave. Well that wasn't it at all. To do something like that you must have really hated him. No no no, I loved him. I was trying to talk to him. And I know it sounds crazy now but what I was trying to do was to clear a passage through the earth so that he could hear me. I wanted to tell him that I loved him and I couldn't accept the fact that he was dead. Can you now? Yes I can. You see, when he was sick I was very bad to him. Really bad. But when he was dying I felt guilty about it and I told him I was sorry and he said that he'd never forgive me. "I'll never forgive you," he said, and then he died before I could tell him I loved him. Before I could explain myself to him. They said that you were seen lurking around funeral parlors, that you went to strangers' funerals and made trouble. I just wanted to get a message to my father. I'd talk to the dead person and I'd ask 'em to take a message to my father to tell him that I loved him. This is making you uncomfortable, isn't it? Little bit. Why is that? [sighs] Well I don't know how you guys are taking all this. I mean, I don't know what goes through your heads when I say this to you. Is it all true? Yes it is. - [Superintendent] Then why should we make anything else of it? I don't know. Yet you say that you're not upset about this anymore. No I'm not. In a letter here to your wife you say that the print shop is busy making a personal stationary for the medical staff. That the guards' food is much better than the patients' food. Are you upset about those things? What does all this got to do with my father? Do you know that if the guards' had better food than the patients' that would be a violation of the statutory codes? The guards do get better food than the patients. Would you say that is a fact or your opinion? I don't know. But most interesting of all you mention in a letter here a patient named Mitchell. You recall him? Yes, he died on the ward about two years ago, didn't he? Of a heart attack? But Frank says here that the man died because of a beating administered by a number of the guards on the ward. A mass beating. Do you still believe that, Frank? Do you still believe the man died from a beating? No. But you don't sound sure. We'd like you to tell us what you really feel. No, he died from being sick, passed away. Heart attack, actually. Yeah, heart attack. He got sick and died of a heart attack. Here Frank, why don't you take some of this water? He died by being beaten to a bloody pulp by four guards, that's what he died of. You seem to be getting upset. Yeah, I'm getting upset. Why don't you guys ever come into this place? Why don't you ever take a look around, see what's going on? We have guys being beaten, killed, we get no help of any kind, we're left to rot in there and die. Don't take my word for it, ask any of the other patients. But Frank I must point out to you that Hillsgate is not being evaluated here. We haven't committed any crime. You have. You're the one who must pass muster here. When and if you do that, you're a free man. And after that point you can go out and shout your message to the multitudes. I only have one message, sir. Stop the beatings, stop the murders, and stop the corruption. We also have an obligation to protect you from yourself. Do you honestly think that you're ready to leave Hillsgate? [shouting] Guards! Sedation! You come and spend a couple of days up there with me here. Come and spend a couple of days with me and see what goes on there. I guarantee there in two days you'll be calling for your ma! You'll be wetting your pants and calling for your ma! [shouting] [tense music] - [Donahue] Easy does it, that's it. What happened to you at the hearing? What are you talking about? I thought you were gonna back me up. You just sat there and let them chew me apart. Look Frank, let's get one thing straight. You're the one that jumped Dr. Brink at that meeting, not me. He attacked me! No, you attacked him. He used a known technique in these evaluation conferences. Listen Wyler, he was forcing me to lie. As long as I kept on lying I would have gotten off the hook, isn't that right, isn't that what would have happened? I don't know what would have happened. How can I answer that question? Well I'm telling you that's what would have happened! And you would have just sat there and let him continue to force me to lie, wouldn't you? - [Reverend Wyler] That's right, I wouldn't have said anything. Terrific, an honest answer! Would you like to know the reason why? - [Frank] Yeah I'd love to know the reason why. Because that's the way these conferences are conducted. They're designed to put you under pressure to see how you behave yourself. I didn't design them and I don't like them. So what were you doing there? - [Reverend Wyler] Well I'd like to think I was giving you some moral support. Well you can forget that little fantasy. Let me tell you something, Frank. Just because I don't conform to this role you're designing for me doesn't mean that I'm your arch enemy. I'm not a crusader. That's what you wanna do with your life, fine, god bless you. But it hasn't gotten you very far up to now, has it? The one thing I think I know how to do is how to help people cope with things as they are. I'd like to think that I've been some help to you in that respect. I want another hearing! - [Reverend Wyler] I can't help you there. Well then what can you do for me? Just what I've been doing. Listen Wyler, all I know is that every horror that I talked about at that hearing yesterday you were aware of, and with all your fine speeches you know how to keep your mouth shut when it's convenient. I'm sorry you feel that way. I am too. I'm not gonna die in this place. [muttering] Hey, we're in business. 50 bucks. 50 bucks? 50 bucks when he can get it. 50 bucks for one blade? It's what we need, ain't it? You trust him? I don't see where's we got no choice. Who is that guy, who is he? He's an outsider. Been working here for 20 years but he's a hustler. He would sell his mother for 50 bucks. Okay. Okay. [whistling] - [Frank] This is what I want. This is dowel and this is a one by four not two by four. What is it? It's a towel rack. Can you make it? Yeah, but it'll cost you. How much? Two bottles. One. But I'll make it almond. Yeah? Yeah. It's a deal. [whistling] [light music] Wow man, you gonna wear that thing out. How many times you play that thing already? About three or four, why? Yeah but every night. You don't understand. If it wasn't for that song I would probably end up in a mental institution. [laughing] You got it? You got the sauce? Come on Frank, I knew what you guys were up to before I even came down here. Hey stupid, it took you two weeks to earn that! Savor it, savor it! Okay, go stand by the door, okay? Man this thing is awfully small. You sure we can get through here? You sure if I can get through here? Raise your shoulders. Okay. Exhale. [groaning] Push. Ooh wait a minute, don't force it, don't force it. Man there's no way I'm gonna get through this thing unless I lose some weight or something. If you can't make it fit I hear lard is pretty good. [groaning] Man I just can't get this one shoulder through. And I'm so damn hungry them patients' food starting to look good to me. How much have you dropped so far? About 10, 11 pounds but I'm still dropping. Listen I wanna ask you a question, I wanna ask you a personal question. Alright, shoot. Okay. When I first got here, how come you spoke to me? What'd you open up to me for? I mean there's been a lot of people come here since me and I've never seen you do that with anybody else. Number two, why'd you get me that job in the kitchen? I don't know. I really honestly don't know. I think that I saw a little bit of me in you when I first got here. Like you knowed you had just walked into hell. Hmm. Hey, what about that 50 bucks you owe Morelli? Well we got 42 now. Hey man, when Morelli says 50 bucks he means 50 bucks. I figure two, three days we gonna have the rest. Alright. Listen you guys, I make the best pies in the whole state. Maybe the whole country. Every time I make 'em they get better and better. They're even getting famous. I mean when the visitors come here they always ask about my pies. Hey Mr. Morelli, how's your pies? Got any samples? [laughs] Even the brass when they come up here on inspection they don't care about you fruitcakes, they just ask about-- Where do you want it? Got it all? Yeah. 50? Yeah. Sure have a nice business here, Mr. Morelli. What are you complaining about? You got the dough out of the sandwiches you hustled out of here in the first place. Put it in my desk drawer, top right. Where's ours? I told you put it in my desk drawer, top right. [light jazzy music] How you doing? Not bad. My hand's kinda raw. Let me know, I'll give you a break. - [Frank] Another minute. Hold it, hold it. Guard's coming around. Okay. Come on, I'll give that break. You know what I was thinking about while I was standing over there? - [Frank] What? When my folks used to come visit me. My mother and sister would come in and I would tell them how they used to beat me and make me fight. My mother said I oughta pay more attention to the rules. Then when I tried to explain it to my sister she said I was always a wild kid. So then I used to get 'em help me get outta here. They stopped coming. It's a hell of a thing ain't it when your own folks give up on you. I have to wait for my children! You don't understand, I have to wait for them! [shouting] I have to wait for my children! - [Jim] What's that? It's cool, we're just getting a new tenant in the building. Hold it down there now, you're almost home. I have to wait for my children! Hold it down there now, believe me. You don't understand! I have to wait for my children! You don't understand! I have to wait for my children! You don't understand, help me! I have to wait for my children! I have to wait for them! I have to wait for my children! I have to wait for them! Okay. - [Man] I have to wait for my children! I have to wait for them. - [Frank] Uh oh, wait a minute. What? - [Jim] Something's wrong, something's weird. What? I don't know, wait a minute. [laughing] Man we ain't getting outta here. We ain't getting outta here tonight, we ain't getting outta here tomorrow night, we ain't never getting outta here. Why? 'Cause there's another bar in here keeps turning with the saw. Wait but I hear it up here. I bet they're made out of steel or something. In fact I bet you all these bars are made like that. Yeah there's another one inside alright. It's set on ball bearings. That rotten Morelli, he knew exactly what was gonna happen! 50 for that piece of garbage! Get me out! I'm gonna burn this place down and I'm gonna kill him! Get off of me, get off! I'm gonna kill him! Mate you ain't killing nobody, just be cool. If the guards come in find out we're trying to get out of here that's gonna be it for both of us, you understand? Now just be cool. I'm gonna tell you what you're gonna do. You gonna lay here and you gonna keep your eye on that door, you understand? I'm taking this polish and covering up this mess. That's gonna be the end of it, you hear? That's gonna be it. Hey Carlo, go keep an eye out for Morelli, will you? Keep an eye out for Morelli, will you? Get outta here! What are you doing with that syringe? I'm fixing Mr. Morelli's famous pies. - [Jim] Yeah but what's that you putting in 'em? Water. You putting water in his pies? Yeah. I don't forget that $50 saw blade. Every time I do him, like the molasses in his shoes, I take off a buck. [laughing] You the one that did that? Yeah. I think this one's worth about three, what do you think? Oh three at least man. Man you don't forget nothing, do you? I don't forget anything anymore. Now let's everybody say Merry Christmas. - [All] Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas! [piano Christmas music] Alright, say bye bye to your sweetie. Thanks. Today's the day. What's up, where you going? I'm getting out, silly. Who said so? I got the papers. Hey, you know about that? Yeah, I know about it. Huh. I'm leaving now. Take it easy. I'll write you, kid. And you write me like you said, huh? Hey when did he get sprung? How come he's getting outta here? Man he's got a season pass. He's been out twice before. He'll be out for about a month. Then he'll look at some high school kid and fall in love and he'll be right back. Merry Christmas you fruitcakes! Merry Christmas, Mr. Morelli. [cheering] [clapping] Morelli chocolate cream pies! Wait'll you get your chops into this! Here we go. Oh those are beautiful. Oh ho. Here you go. That beautiful, huh? You ready for that? There we are! [laughing] - [Guard] They're not set. Wait, let me try the other one. Like chocolate pudding. Wait a minute, just a minute. Something went wrong with that. Either that or somebody's screwing around with my pies. My pies! - [Frank] What's the matter, Mr. Morelli? Something happened to my pies. What happened? I don't know. I don't understand. Look at 'em, they're like all watery. Yeah, you probably lost your touch, Mr. Morelli. I didn't lose my touch. I been making these pies for 20 years. I didn't lose my touch! I think somebody's been messing around with my pies. You think somebody's been messing with 'em? Yeah. Hey Carlo, who's been messing with Mr. Morelli's pies? Man, I don't know a darn thing. He don't know nothing, Mr. Morelli. You probably lost your touch. Happens to everybody. [pats] [shouting] I just don't, hey Carlo. Come on. You play with him for a while. Let's go big mama you'll miss your bus. Alright. Hey I'll treasure this. Bye bye. So long you darling weirdos. I like to think that I'm going to miss all this, but I don't know. Merry Christmas. Alright now we're gonna sing "silent night, holy night". Player ready? Okay. ♪ Silent night ♪ Holy night ♪ All is calm ♪ All is bright ♪ Round young virgin mother and child ♪ ♪ Holy infant so tender and mild ♪ ♪ Sleep in heavenly peace Hey hey, how about a sandwich? It's Christmas. Merry Christmas. Hank says Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to you, Hank. Want a sandwich? [whistle blowing] Take a bite. ♪ All is calm, all is bright How about a sandwich, Charlie? I'll leave you one for later, okay? I'll put it in the tree. You can take it if you want it. ♪ Holy infant so tender and mild ♪ ♪ Sleep in heavenly peace ♪ Sleep in heavenly peace [whistle blowing] That was real good. Now let's everybody say Merry Christmas. - [All] Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! [solemn music] Frankie. Jesus Frankie I got a little plastered today. What else is new? I don't know. [mysterious music] [dramatic music] Let go of him, let go of him, get up here. [whistle blowing] Everybody inside! Clean it up, let's go! Come on, let's move it. Move 'em in. Hurry up, move it. Everybody, let's go. Let's go, come on Blair. Move it. Everybody inside! Inside, step it up! Come on, move, move! Come on, move! You alright? Yeah. Thanks a lot. Inside, Mr. Dole. Right. Still playing with your toys, huh? Yeah. I head that you saved Donahue from a haircut this afternoon. Yeah. Not a lot of guys would have done that. What made you do it? I don't know, just happened. Oh yeah? Well it was a mistake. No it wasn't, it was instinct. Benton was running after Donahue with a chair over his head screaming so I dropped him. I don't want a medal. Yeah well you sure ain't getting no medals. Might even lose a few friends behind it. Look what I found today. Yeah I been watching you collecting things for over a year now. Where you been getting 'em from? Oh, everywhere. This one I found in Marley's jacket when he went to the bathroom. This one Di Salvo left with a pack of cigarettes on a sink counter. This one I don't know where I got. Ain't got no markings on 'em so what are they good for? Open doors. What doors? I don't know. Every time I go past a door I try one. Sooner or later I'm gonna find the right key in the right door. Then what? Then we walk on outta here. I'm not gonna rot in this place like Carlo. We're gonna make it. Wait wait, hold up. What did you say? We're gonna make it next time. You said we. I want you to get something straight right now. Next time you say we in relationship to you and me getting outta here you drop the we, you got it? Would you tell me what am I gonna do once I get outta here? Spend the rest of my life running like a wanted crazed murderer, huh? Man I was doing alright while I was in here before you came in here. Man I must have been a fool to let you convince me that we could get outta here and make it. But I ain't gonna be no fool no more, you hear me? I mean I've had it man, I've had it. So from now when you think of you and me getting out of here you leave the me out! Because I've had it! Do you hear me? I've had it. [murmuring] Salad, Charlie? Look who's come home again. Hey, it's the pudgy man! Frank. How are you? Okay, okay. Take care him, he hasn't been eating too well. Welcome home. Thank you. You just get in? Yeah yeah, Donahue just now. Want something to eat? Yeah. See you're still making the same lousy potatoes. Yeah it's the same, it's the same batch. I believe it. Hey. You gonna have to get some new action. That's an item over there. You don't think I was exactly alone all that time, do you? Then why'd you get caught, jerk? Lucky I guess. Get tough. C'est la vie. Mr. Di Salvo. Mr. Johnson. Just couldn't stay away from us, could you? Sorry, serving line is closed. What do you mean closed? What difference does it make? I gotta eat like everybody else. Can't serve you. Who are you anyway? You're not from this ward. Look man, I'm hungry. I got to eat. So would you put some food on the tray and shut up? Do me a favor. You want some food, talk to the guards. I don't make the rules around here. Are you gonna give me some food or not? I can't give you any food! Don't you think I'm pretty enough to serve? Don't you think I'm pretty enough to kiss? I think you're fine. Now will you put your arms down please? What'd you call me? What? I said what did you call me? I didn't call you anything. Look man, I heard you, I know exactly what you said. Now what did you call me? Guards, guard, this man insulted me, calling me dirty names. What's all the racket? This man insulted me. Called me dirty names. He's lying, Mr. Johnson. That's terrible. What'd you call him? I didn't call him anything. He's got problems. Well now one of you's lying and I ain't gonna get in on it. You just gonna have to settle it between yourselves the usual way. A cock fight? That's okay with me. I'm not getting into a cock fight with this maniac. Oh yeah. You gonna fight, sure. - [Jim] Mr. Johnson he don't wanna fight your man. Well he doesn't have nothing to say about it. They stand there calling each other liars and they gonna settle it. Well I keep hearing him say that he don't wanna fight him. Suppose I fight your man. He ain't my man. But that's an interesting idea. Alright J ward, tomorrow. What in the hell was that all about? Mr. Dole. I'd like to speak to you a minute. I want you to know I had nothing to do with what went down in the mess hall. Doesn't matter. Does to me. I told 'em when I first come here not to count me in their games. Is that all? I owe you. For what you did that day. But that don't make me your pal, understand? Oh yeah, I wouldn't have it any other way. I mean why should my saving your life change our relationship? Kid for my money you don't even belong in here. I'm telling that to you privately 'cause you ain't never gonna hear it repeated. As long as you are, I go by the book, clear? Clear as a bell. [sighs] Donahue just buttonholed me in the bathroom to inform me that he didn't have anything to do with what happened in the mess hall this afternoon. Which pretty much confirms my suspicion that it is a set up. Thought you weren't gonna fight again. What are you waiting for? For me to say that I had something to do with it? I didn't. I didn't ask you to get into this, I didn't ask for your help and I don't want your protection. Finished? If you're waiting for me to thank you you're gonna have to wait until hell freezes over. Dumb. God is this dumb. Hey when you're through here turn the others on. Frank. Yeah. Gonna need some more spuds in there. Soon as I'm done here. Betting's real heavy, don't let us down. You didn't bet nothing, did you? Yeah I did, I always do. Why? Nothing. What's wrong? What do you mean what's wrong? Nothing wrong. What's the matter with you? What are you looking at me like that for? I didn't do nothing, this was your idea, it's on your head. Yeah it is, isn't it? Time for an inspection, Baker. Come on boy, clean up day. I don't want your hat! Take it easy, man. Let's go. Let's go. How you feeling? - [Morelli] Frank, did you get those spuds? Get right on it, Mr. Morelli. I'll get right on it, Mr. Morelli. I could be a seal barking in here the way you guys listen to me! What are you doing? [suspenseful music] Dole, where the hell are you? Coming, Mr. Morelli! Where's Jim? He should have been here an hour ago. I asked you a question. Where's Jim? I don't know where he's at. - [Johnson] Hey Dole bring me another hunk of that apple pie. Coming! Here's your pie, sir. I'll take a piece of that pineapple. - [Di Salvo] Yeah it looks pretty good, I'll take the same. How'd the fight go? Pass the sugar. Lot of money exchange hands? The only reason I ask is that I had five bucks on it myself. What fight would that be, Mr. Dole? The cock fight over on J ward. Cock fights is against the rules, Mr. Dole. Hey Carlo, where's Jim? Where's Jim? Where's Jim? Geez Frank, watch it. If I don't get some answers I'm gonna kill you. Where's Jim? What happened to him? Frank, I don't know where the hell he's at. Look, he lost, okay? Okay now let me go. What do you mean he lost? Okay, the guy wipes up the ward with him. He don't even raise a hand to defend himself. It's like he didn't wanna fight back. [breathing heavily] They worked him over? Six of 'em. Took him up to R ward. Gave him a shot of spirine. Then they put the boots to him. Who? Johnson, Di Salvo, all of 'em. Donahue? Oh he was out in the hall, he knew what the hell was going on. And everybody just stood around, nobody said anything? Oh we stood around alright. We turned our backs. You were there? I did what everybody else did, Frankie. I turned my back. I did what you'd have done if you'd have been there. I did what we always done. [tense music] Frank, wait minute. What the hell you gonna prove? He's probably okay. You leave it to me, I'll find out for you. Now look he's probably up in the hospital ward with a couple of bumps on his head. Come on, take it easy Frank. Take it easy. [pensive music] How long you been standing there? I just got here. What's the matter with you, you're getting like the rest of these paranoids. I don't know, I'm just jumpy. I just talked to Little Sam, he's got an in with one of the guards up in T ward. They got Jim in the isolation room. Well what did they say about him? Is there any news, is he okay? It's his head. He hasn't come to yet. But he should be okay in a couple days. I don't know what happened to him. All of a sudden about a month ago he just stopped being there. He just didn't care anymore, Frank. It happens a lot in here. I been here a long time, I've seen it. Happened to Jim. Just didn't care. He wouldn't have been happy on the outside. He wasn't happy on the inside. So he just gave up. I don't understand that, I don't know how somebody can just give up. Well everybody's different. What about you, how come you're so happy all the time? You know, if I was on the outside they'd grab me and have me in a loony bin just like that. So you really like it here, you could just stay here forever with no complaints? I don't know if you understand what I mean, Frank, but I've got a good deal here. I've got everything I want, everything I need. This is the best home I've ever had. And that's my philosophy, man. That's no philosophy, that's a cop out. Giving up isn't a philosophy. Yeah but it keeps me going. When I was a kid I caught a raccoon, I kept him in a cage in the basement. And I made this lock out of two wires that he'd never be able to figure out and he kept playing with it and playing with it and I'd watch over in the corner and after about a week and a half he got out. He didn't know he couldn't make it. That's my philosophy. Yeah. It's been a long day. You don't mind. How you feeling, Frank? I'm okay. I didn't get any sleep last night. Yeah, that's the way it goes, it can happen just like that. With all the aggravation I get around this joint it could happen to me when I'm reaching for a bottle of sauce. What are you talking about? Alright you guys, let's go. Hey you got yourself a new job, kid. From now on you take over Jim's work. What are you talking about? He's gonna be okay! Not in this life. I thought you knew. Your pal died a couple hours ago. I heard it coming in. Heart attack. Can you believe a big ox like that with a heart attack? Hey. Get me a cup of coffee. I'll get your damn coffee in a minute, I gotta take care of him. Come on kid, come on, let's take a walk. Come on. Cool it Frank, you can bring the whole thing down! Cool it. [sobbing] Pull yourself together, Frank. They can't get away with this! Come on Frank, pull yourself together. They can't be allowed to get away with this! They're getting away with it Frank. Somebody's gotta tell people what the hell is going on in here! Who's gonna tell 'em, Frank? Who's gonna tell 'em? You? Who you gonna tell, the court? They sent you up here. Your wife? Hell she doesn't even write to you anymore. Frank, you're in a state hospital for the criminally insane. There's nobody on the outside that's gonna believe one damn thing you've got to say. Come on, come on, pull it together. [tense music] Mr. Donahue, can I ask you a question? What are you doing in a place like this? You don't seem like the other guards to me. Don't count on that. No I'm serious, you're better than this place. Kid I got nine years invested here. Maybe if I was a gambling man, but I'm not. You're an honest man, Mr. Donahue. The kind of man that doesn't reneg on his debts. Okay. Now I know why I've been getting center cuts of meat. You still feel like you owe me? You still feel that way? Go on. I wanna get a letter out of here. Unopened. Who to? My wife. You still think you got any secrets from us after all these years? What is it, six, seven? Seven, yeah. I wanna get a package back to me and I wanna make sure that it's unopened and not poured over. I can't do that, kid. You know better. Sorry, no way. Well how about if I let you look at it? I don't think so. Maybe if I opened it. Okay but only you. Where is the letter? You won't regret it and I promise that you will not get involved. I don't believe you, but I do pay my bills. Consider it paid. After this you got no more call on me. Even up. [knocking] Come on in. Apple pie, can I get you some? No pie for me. I'm supposed to see you Mr. Donahue? Oh yeah, there's a package here for you. It's over there. Sign for it. Thanks Mr. Donahue. - [Di Silvo] Anything interesting? Nah, mostly clothes, some eats, peanut butter, crackers, that sort of stuff. [suspenseful music] - [Frank Voiceover] I finally got just what I wanted. A miniature camera, tape recorder, an eight millimeter movie camera, and enough tape and film to tell the world. In order to conceal the tape recorder and still carry it around, I put it inside an old radio. The camera was easy, just fit into a cigar package. You see, Irish [mumbles]. But he walked away from it. All of a sudden he jumped up and come a running after him. Oh that was the wrong move. - [Johnson] I don't have to tell you it was. So you shined your boots on him. I mean we put the boots to him. - [Frank] Did it do any good? Well you know, maybe for about a month. Hmm. Then we had to do it all over again. You know in the end he finally wound up like Mitchell on T ward. You remember Mitchell, don't you? They wrote down heart attack. Was the boots that done it. Them boots'll catch up with you if you don't watch out. You make pretty damn good coffee, kid. Thank you very much, Mr. Johnson. Would you like a cigar? - [Johnson] Yeah, don't mind if I do. - [Frank] May I? Yeah, help yourself. Thank you. [camera shutter clicking] [suspenseful music] - [Frank Voiceover] Hiding the movie camera was a little bit more complicated. I cut a nest for it in a piece of foam rubber and then I hid it in a little pillow. And the guards were used to seeing us carry objects around as kind of security blankets so they didn't pay much attention. This is it. What is? It's an ashtray. Can you do it? Yeah, I guess so. Okay I need two of them exactly alike. Then I want two sandwiches. You do it right I give you four sandwiches. I don't want four, I want two. Okay. How long can you do it in? Seven days. Can you make it five? Yeah. Great. Geez I don't know Frank. Look you're in there every day cleaning, right? Yeah. All I want you to do is put it on the desk. Let it sit there for a couple weeks. I want 'em to get used to it. I don't know. Hey Frank, you know you don't have to bribe me to do you a favor. But since you went to all the trouble I don't wanna hurt your feelings. I'll do it for you Frank, I'll take care of it. Okay. [suspenseful music] - [Frank Voiceover] I filmed the things that went on on the ward. The dope, the homosexuality, the brutality. For example what you're seeing here is where the guards would zonk some guy a triple dose of thorazine and then bet on how many seconds it would take to knock him out. - [Frank] Mr. Morelli, I hear that some of the patients found out that the guards are getting different food. Do you know about that? - [Morelli] So what? - [Frank] Well patients are supposed to eat the same as the guards, that's the law, isn't it? - [Morelli] It's the same food, beef's beef and pork's pork. - [Frank] Yeah but isn't there a difference in quality and cut? Give 'em an extra helping of bread. What they gonna do, write the governor? [laughing] Would you like a cigar, Mr. Morelli? I never touch 'em, kid. I plan to live a long life. Yeah, life's good, isn't it? You bet. And you know what I really like? - [Frank] What's that? When I see a guy like you change over the years into a alright hombre. You understand? Yeah, thank you. Hey you've come a long way. Thanks. So how come I'm still here, Mr. Morelli? [laughing] What do you want on the outside? I mean you got food, shelter. Out there it's dog eat dog, right kid? Beats me, I don't know why you wanna make a switch, Frank. You already got one up there. Carlo. I trust you. Turn it over. Hmm. Carlo it's a wireless mic. If we put that in the guard's room I'll be able to hear everything they say. What do you wanna do that for, Frankie? Oh, be interesting. I'm not interested in what they got to say. I don't know, I gotta think this over, Frank. Think it over. No, no Frankie I really gotta think this one over. I understand. Don't do anything you don't wanna do. I'll let you know, okay Frankie? Yeah. Okay pal. Greenberg I want you to check under all them ovens. Want you to check all the freezers. West, you check the pantry. Shannon, make sure he's clean and I mean clean. Clean he will be. Come on joy boy you've done this before. Assume the position. What the hell's going on? What are you guys doing in here? You ever seen him skulking around in here trying to stash something? Why would he stash anything in here? Come on come on come on come on. Keep your mouth shut about this. Come on back to peeling those spuds, huh? False alarm. You know you could save yourself a hell of a lot of problems if you just tell us where you stashed that stuff. Wait a minute Frankie, please. I wanna talk to you. Sit down there! [door slams] Little bit of excitement down in main dietary tonight. You don't happen to know anything about it, do you? Why should I, Frank? I've always been very good to you Carlo. Whenever you needed anything you didn't do without. Who ratted on me about the ashtray? I didn't tell 'em nothing! Who did then? Say nothing to 'em Frank, I didn't say nothing. Who ratted on me about the ashtray? I didn't, Frank. What did you tell them? One guard maybe I told. He ain't gonna say nothing. Nothing's come back to you, has it Frank? What did you tell him? Look Frank, you're trying to make too many changes around here for me. This is my home, Frank, and I don't like the changes you're trying to make. Just leave me alone, okay Frank? Leave me alone, will you Frank? Get outta here Carlo, go to bed. I ain't sorry I done it, Frank. Terrific, go to bed. I ain't sorry. [door slams] Can I get you something, Mr. Johnson? No. I'll be late coming on the floor tonight, I gotta clean out the meat locker. I'll pass the word. Thanks a lot. Mr. Morelli, I'm not gonna make the dinner shift tonight. They got me on latrine duty. What do you want me to do, talk to 'em? No, that'll probably just make 'em uptight. You know the way they been about me lately. Whatever you say, kid. Thanks Mr. Morelli. That's enough. Give it a stir. I'm going to town til four, I'll see you then. [suspenseful music] - [Frank Voiceover] The steam pipes and power lines could only lead to one place, the power plant. And the power plant at Hillsgate was outside. [hitting] Finally, after I don't know how many petitions, I was certified competent to stand trial on the original charges. I felt very confident that if I told my story and there were people there who would listen that there was no way that I wouldn't get out of Hillsgate. Well here he is, he's all yours. Get 'em off and let's get him inside. Where do I know you from? Right here. Oh. There are a few of us still remember you. You tore this place up pretty good one time. Remember that, huh? Yeah. Long time ago. Yeah. You're all better now? I'm fine, thanks. That's good. Good luck. Thank you. Your attorney's right inside. Okay. This way Mr. Dole. Frank. Hi. Good morning. Well here we go. My wife isn't here? She was supposed to, there was a problem. Later I think she's coming. How would you characterize his ability to understand and to reason when he first came to Hillsgate? I don't think he understood much of what he'd done but he's come a long way since then, a very long way. Do you categorically rule out the possibility that he might have been faking the symptoms, that is, faking his insanity? It's very unlikely. Well could he not have been able to fool even you perhaps? In an effort to evade responsibility for the bizarre antisocial acts he committed. I don't think so. - [Lawyer] Well then, how would you characterize his present state of mind? I beg pardon? You said he'd come a long way. Are the symptoms then completely gone? Is he cured? I think he's rational. Thank you. You may cross-examine, council. I'd like to repeat the question. Do you think he's cured? Yes, I think so. Reverend Wyler, you're a minister of the church. Yes, I am. With psychiatric training? No. Medical training? No. Well then perhaps you have a degree in psychology, a PhD? No sir. - [Lawyer] Well surely a master's degree in psychology. No, none of them. Then on what do you base your assessment of the defendant's state of mind? Observation and a sensitivity to people and experience. Well, with all of your intensive study in the field, if the decision were left to you, would you recommend he be returned to society, to walk out of this courtroom a free man? I don't know if I can answer that. Your honor, I object. I object on the grounds the question-- Maintain quiet in here, quiet!. You can sit right here, gentlemen. Thank you officer. Listen, you have to explain something to me because I still don't understand it. Why aren't I pleading guilty? Even if they find me guilty I will have already served my time, I can walk out of here a free man. Look, look we have a perfectly good defense. You were mentally unhinged at the time. Ergo legally not guilty. I changed my mind, I wanna take the stand. Why? Because there are things about Hillsgate I wanna talk about. You can't! Why? You are on trial here for certain acts you committed. You're on trial, you understand? We don't have much time. Don't open your mouth about anything. I'm not putting you on the stand. We'll see what happens. Look Frank, I am defending you from certain charges. I'm not interested in anything that's not directly related. Neither is the court. Whatever may have happened out there at Hillsgate is irrelevant. The only question is what was your state of mind at the time you committed those acts. There is no doubt in my mind that at the time, he had no knowledge of the gravity of the acts he was committing. In other words he was insane. As legally defined, yes. By so describing him you are of course referring to his mental state at the time of his admission to Hillsgate. Yes. And subsequently. Subsequently. You mean prior to the care and treatment he received at your hospital? Yes. And right now. Up to the present. The man is dangerously volatile. He needs help. There's no guarantee at this time that his violent reactive state won't reoccur. To throw him upon society now would be-- I have spent a total of two hours with this man in the past seven years. [banging gavel] He doesn't know me from Adam. Mr. Dole, you'll be seated. He's throwing around a lot of technical terms but he's no more qualified to be up there than Reverend Wyler is. He's no psychiatrist. He talks about Hillsgate as if it's a hospital, I tell you it's a sewer! There are men killed there, there are men beaten to death there! And I've got the tapes and I've got the film to prove it! He knows what I'm talking about, look at his face! - [Judge] Instruct your client that unless he controls himself in these proceedings that I'm going to have him forcibly removed from the courtroom. Mr. Dole, there's someone here to see you. Hello. Hello. How are you? - [Louise] I'm okay. How are the kids? Oh, they're fine. I've been wanting to tell you how everything happened. And I want you to know that it had nothing to do with you, that it was just everything crashed in on me. I was there. Everything crashed in on me too. Well it'll never happen again. I will never again hurt you the way I did. I will never frighten you the way I did or-- Frank. I came here for a reason. I think that you should hear what I have to say. Yeah well I just want you to know that I'm well again. Frank I started a divorce action. I want you to know that I'm well, that I'm gonna get out of that place, that I'm gonna get a job and I wanna take care of you and the kids. Frank, I can't go back to that life. I have a new life now and that's it. I wanna explain something to you. I did you a favor by not appearing in court, I want you to understand that. Your lawyer asked me to testify and I told him that I would and then when I told him what I had to say he said that I wouldn't be helping you and that's why I wasn't there. I really want you to understand that. Do you understand? Yeah, I understand. You see we just don't do each other any good. I obviously am not helping you and with you, I'm just scared all the time and I can't live that way, you see I just can't do it. [crying] Does that make any sense to you? Sure. I don't know what else to say. There's nothing else to say. They want him up above. They're ready for you, Mr. Dole. This was very hard for me! Thank you. The defendant will please rise. We, in the above entitled action, find the defendant not guilty on all three counts by reason of insanity. The defendant will remain in custody while the court studies the remaining indictments against him. - [Lawyer] Does your honor have any idea how long that might be? - [Judge] I would imagine a matter of hours. Court will stand in recess until nine o'clock tomorrow morning. You know what time it is? A little after seven. Did anybody come for me or leave a message? Your lawyer just arrived. Now get your things together Frank, you're getting outta here! Hello Mr. Dole. What are you doing? I'm sorry Frank. The order came down a couple hours ago. You were acquitted on the charges but the judge found you still mentally incompetent. Not ready to leave Hillsgate. Let's go sir. Deal me in, Charlie. I'm only kidding, play. What's the matter, Charlie? So, did you miss me?- Yeah Frankie. I didn't miss you. You know what they got out there walking around the streets? Ladies. You know what I ate? Two hamburgers. Have a piece of gum. [tapping] What's going on? Word's out about what you said in court, Frank. What'd I say in court? I didn't say anything in court. Tell me exactly what did you say? Don't play games, Carlo. - [Carlo] I'm not playing games with you. What's on your mind? What I mean is Frank you've gotta be careful. Why? They still think you've got some stuff stashed around here. What you mean, like tapes and films? Whatever. You gonna rat on me again, Carlo? Look Frankie what I'm telling you is for your own good. You gotta be careful, you gotta watch your step. They're trying to get any kind of a reason to send you an invitation back into that Peanut Room. Better behave myself. Hey, somebody made a terrible mistake! We've got hot water! [snaps] Ah, who's messing around? You said something in court about having tapes and pictures and stuff. No I just must've been distraught. You wanna close us down, don't you? Mr. Johnson, why would I wanna do a thing like that? I like it here. This is my home. I'm gonna give you a choice. You tell me where that stuff's hidden and you walk outta here. You don't, I'm gonna give you a shot of spirine and shine my boots on you. Where is it? [shouting] [hitting] Give it to him! [screaming] Alright, alright, what's going on in here? Oh. Look at that. Must've fell, hurt himself in the shower. Take care of him, will you? Frank. Frankie. Come on, give me a hand. The man's a fool. Look what he's done to himself! Let's just get him out of here. Somebody come over here, get his shoulders. You get his feet. Careful. Oh he's bleeding over everything. Easy. Careful. Yeah, yeah. Okay. [mumbling] I warned him, didn't I? Get me some fresh water. Yeah, water. Frankie? Mm. Frank you hear me? Yeah. Hey listen, you gotta take this as a warning. They were just playing around with you this time, kid. You gotta be careful. They're gonna watch every move you make. I really... I really appreciate the advice, Carlo. They're still worried about what you got and if they find out same thing's gonna happen to you that happened to Mitchell. Oh. I won't die here because I'm going to California. You're gonna go where? I have to go to California. Go get my stuff. Can't get outta here. - [Frank] I can get outta here. You can't get, there's only two ways you can get outta here Frankie. In a pine box the way Jim did. Or with a pass. Without a pass. Only people that leave this place without a pass are the guards. Right. It's lights out, I gotta beat it. You stay cool, kid. Goodnight Carlo. [suspenseful music] Hey Frank. Couple friends of yours out here to see you. - [Frank] You got an appointment? [laughs] How you doing Frank? Hi Frank. - [Frank] What's up? Look what I found. Now that'll keep a guy's ears warm on a cold stormy night. Nice color. Wanna sell it? Oh no no Frank I could never do that. I wouldn't wanna do that. But you can borrow it if you want to. Well I don't know when I can get it back to you. Oh anytime, it doesn't matter, whenever. By the way Frank, here's that 10 bucks I borrowed. You didn't borrow 10 bucks. - [Carlo] Yeah he did. Eh? You must have forgotten. You crazy guys! Really Frank, don't come on to me now. I'm engaged. Come on, let's get outta here. Enjoy, Frank. Thanks. Anything else you need, kid? Nope. Just a little good luck and some rotten weather. [sighs] [rain pouring] [thunder rumbling] [claps] Alright you guys, come on, let's go! Hustle it up! Come on now, let's finish cleaning up in here huh? I wanna get home before that storm really busts loose! Come on speedy, move, move! [thunder rumbling] You know if anybody wanted to bust out of this joint this would be the right night to do it. I don't know what you're talking about. I don't know what you're talking about either. As long as we understand each other. Hey, what are you guys doing to me? Come on, get the lead out will you? I wanna get outta here! Mr. Morelli with the storm and everything would it be okay if we made a pot of coffee for the new shift coming in? - [Morelli] Let 'em make their own coffee! This ain't a hotel. - [Frank] Well I'd just like to help 'em out. - [Morelli] Help yourself out. Geez! Oh for crying out loud, I don't believe it! What'd you do that for? It was an accident, I didn't do it on purpose. You fruitcakes are gonna give me a stroke right in the middle of this stinking kitchen! Come on Morelli, take it easy. Have a cup of coffee. Nuts or something? It's gonna take you two hours to get this up! I'm going home. Mr. Morelli, you want me to stay and help him clean that up? - [Morelli] Yeah yeah, help him, help him. Would you tell the guard where I am please? Look, yeah I'll tell him. And I'm telling you. You get all of that up, every bit of it, you understand? Yes Mr. Morelli. - [Morelli] Come on, let's get out of here. Come on, move it! Well I greased it up for you, Frankie. I don't know if this is the right night. Well if you're still here this time tomorrow I'm gonna spill my guts and tell 'em everything I know. Frankie, this is my home, it's not yours. [thunder rumbling] [suspenseful music] - [Guard] Better hurry, they're gonna lock the gate. Okay, we'll be right out. Come on guys, before they lock you in. Hey Johnson. Sorry to snatch you. Security's looking for you, they want you to call 'em as soon as you get in. Yeah, about what? I dunno. - [Johnson] It's probably the guard roster, I'm late with it. - [Di Salvo] Guess so. Guys got a game going up here? They sure have, they took me to the cleaners. Not me, I'm feeling lucky. Goodnight. Goodnight Johnson. [suspenseful music] [rain pouring] [thunder rumbling] Goodnight. [dramatic music] [light music]
