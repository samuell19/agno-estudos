Well be prepared. He's on the war path. No thanks, this is a little too prepared. You're right George, if you ever showed up for work looking like that, he'd go bananas. Oh no! Nothing like an auto dresser with a sense of humor! [Astro barking] George: Astro will you cut it out! I'm sorry Mr. J I didn't realize you had company. Rosey, it's me! Oh now I recognize you Mr. J!

Rosey: You had to ask. Jane: I'll see what I can do Rosey. Rosey, I don't see anything wrong with it. Elroy: Me either. I think it works great. Elroy! You ordered ice cream for breakfast? Heck no. I ordered capsulated whole grain cereal with dehydrated fruit chips, and then I got lucky. First the one in the face, and then this one. I'm a little late dear, you better make it a light breakfast. Ham, eggs, hashbrowns, toast and coffee. Two out of three isn't bad Mr. J. Thanks! I didn't need that. You can finish my breakfast Dad. Thanks Elroy, but I'm sick enough as it is. I gotta meet Mr. Orbit, He's helping me with my science project; a time machine! Time machine! Now there's a real waste of time! Life is a waste of time! What does it all mean? It probably means another boyfriend's about to bite the dust You're not having trouble with Rex Saturn are you dear? I could care less about Rex what's his name and who needs it career! If he prefers a bunch of groupies to me, Let him go I say! Diary: Oh yeah? That isn't what you said to me! Judy: Di Di! I thought Diaries weren't supposed to be seen or heard.

First thing tomorrow, I'll have the plumber bring a new elephant. Has Fred said anything about where they're taking us on our vacation? Not yet.

[Island music] Hey Wilma will you turn down that radio? The noise is giving me indigestion. It isn't noise it comes from this! and do you know where this comes from? No. But it's the stringiest piece of meat I've ever eaten. Hi Fred, Hi Wilma. Gee, am I late for the costume party? No but we’re going to be late for work. Fred? Haven't you noticed anything? Yeah those grass skirts. your back up to this door we could start a fire. See you later girls. You think they got our message? Personally, I think it came back No body home! You’re late George! George: Only two minutes. [Alarm] And you're gonna get it! Spacely: Jetson! Now! Nice of you to drop in George. George: Yes sir, I uh... Spacely: Nevermind the small talk. We've got trouble George! Yes sir. does it have anything to do with my ear? Cause right now, it's got more trouble than we've got. Can’t talk here. May be bugged. Your office. See you later Jetson! Yeow! R.U.D.I: (Referential Universal Digital Indexer) Good Morning George! Oh, You're not George. You're Mr. Spacely. Thanks. I don't need any dumb computer telling me who I am. Now tune out R.U.D.I! Yes sir Mr. Spacely. I'll be here when you need me George. That isn’t a computer it's a nurse maid. Jetson! There's a leak around here and I want it stopped! Yes sir I know a very good plumber; Mr. Skywrench. An industrial leak you molecule brain! and don’t play innocent with me Jetson! I have my suspicions where that leak is coming from and it's you! Me? Spacely: How else could I explain Cogswell stealing every major project I've come up with right from under my nose?! Well I- I- I... Spacely: Darn right it’s you! You! You! George: But sir? Spacely: I've spent a fortune romancing General Blackhole just to get that secret contract for that interstellar Loner probe! Nobody else new it existed! But are they using Spacely's Sprockets? No! They're using Cogswell Cogs! How do you suppose Cosgwell got wind of it Mr. Spacely? From a windbag like you Jetson! R.U.D.I: Oh no. No. Spacely: I told you to butt out! Spacely: Cogswell has beaten me out of every one of my secret projects! From the Lunar probe to the Humphrey Boggart Look a like Sprockets, for the nostalgia buffs. Rud: tsk. tsk. Too bad sweetheart. George: Uh, What can we do boss? Spacely: Not we! You Jetson! You wanna clear your name? Then find out how Cogsewell's getting his information! [gasps] You mean Spy? Are you suggesting I spy on him Mr. Spacely. Either that or you’re fired! George: Spying doesn't seem like such a bad suggestion when you put it that way sir. Good. Now you can sympathize with him nosy! Gee, I'm sorry George. George: That's okay R.U.D.I. Oh I guess I still have one friend around here. Instead of getting bullied in to taking them where they want to go, we take them to a place they'll like even better. Then we'll be heroes. Barney: Gee I don’t know Fred. [Alarm] Coffee Break! Watch it. Or we'll be spending our vacation in the hospital. Barney: Sorry Fred, I wouldn't want to miss the vacation you've got planned for us. As soon as I find out what it is. Come on I'll treat you to a cup of coconut juice. Now the way I figure Barn, we go in together 50/50. Now, how much did you save for your vacation? Twenty clams. Fred: Good. That gives us thirty clams all together. Now we take... Barney: Uh - just a second Fred, If it's 50/50, I think we're missing ten clams. Fred: Don’t worry about it, you can owe it to me. Now what we do is... Barney: Say Fred, couldn't we just out our feet together? So I could do a little counting? You want to stand around and count toes? Or do you want to hear my plan? Barney: Well, okay. I should've known I was in trouble when I let you buy the coconut juice. Now the way I look at it, Why take a medium vacation for thirty clams, when we can take the girls on a great one For ten times that much? I know you're going to ask, Where are we going to get ten times that much? No, I was gonna ask, What's in the coconut juice? Will you listen? There's a high stakes poker game at the Water Buffalo Lodge tonight. and I feel lucky. But Fred the last six times you felt lucky, you lost! Fred: Strategy. I was just getting rid of all my bad luck. Have you ever seen me lose seven times in a row? Barney: Well no, Fred: Well there you are. Tonight's my lucky night. Mr. Slate: It sure is Flintstone! How's that? Mr. Slate: Cause tonight, you and Rubble are working the late shift. Well I'd like to Mr. Slate, Barney: But he's gonna be... He’s gonna be out of work tommorrow unless he comes to work tonight. Yes Sir. Mr. Slate: Turf Tarpit's company has been out producing us lately because of people like you! Let to work and late back to work from coffee break. Gee, The whistle hasn't sounded yet Mr. Slate. [Whistle] It has now! Get back to work!! Cogswell: Spacely must be so mad he's Chewing sprockets. What are those figures again? Slowly so I can savor them. Eight and a half Billion Humphrey Boggart Cogs. And the figures from sales along the milky way aren’t even in yet Mr. Cogswell. Oh Goody! If you were a woman, I mean a real woman, I could kiss you. S.A.R.A: I’m blushing sir. I've stolen every good idea Spacely's had. and it's up to you to guard em boy. [Growling] Easy boy! It’s not feeding time just yet. You gotta go on your rounds first Cogswell: Sentr, where are you boy? Good fella, Here I brought you a little treat. Your favorite, a cast iron doggy bone. Now don't be bashful enjoy. George: Yeow! You know that "Aah" sounded almost human. Yuck! S.A.R.A: and Mr. Cogsell is going to put me in charge of all computers. and it's all because of the secret information my sweetkins has told me. and you'll see, I'll make sure you're never sorry R.U.D.I my dear. George: R.U.D.I? My dear? My best friend R.U.D.I is the leak! I sure hope Mr. Slate doesn't find out we're not working at the quarry tonight. Barney my boy, you worry too much. Who's gonna tell him? Am I gonna tell him? Are the dumb Dinosaurs gonna tell him? That's another thing Fred. How do we know those dinosaurs will keep working even when we're not there? Fred: Because they've been doing that same digging for years. Barney: Yeah but with human brains guiding them Barney believe me, without us, they're not going to miss a thing. Barney: Ow! Fred: Ow What? What little thing are you worried about now? Fred: Oh, That Little Thing. Barney: If Mr. Slate's in the game, I guess we're out. The girls are gonna have to settle for a smaller vacation. You know what they say Barn, It's not over till the Fat Lady sings. Take a look over there. That fat lady’s over there? Fred: No, but we are, and that's how we're getting in the game. R.U.D.I I've got something to say to you. R.U.D.I I know your in there now come on out! R.U.D.I If you want me to go straight to Mr. Spacely without discussing this with you first, Ah. that's better. You know what I found out at Cogswell's don't you? Now I want you to look me in the eye and tell me it isn’t true. Well? Then it is true! R.U.D.I: Ok, So I fell in love, and leaked a few little bits and pieces of information. R.U.D.I! That was enough to nearyl ruin Mr. Spacely and put all our jobs in jeopardy. Sorry but I gotta report you. R.U.D.I: George: If you just give me a little time, I can straighten it out. George: You can straight it out with Mr. Spacely. Cause that's where I'm going. R.U.D.I: I'm sorry to hear that George. George: It won't do you any good to stop it R.U.D.I. I can walk. Forget it R.U.D.I I don't even need to walk. Not with my anti gravity belt. R.U.D.I one way or the other, I’m going to speak with Mr. Spaceley before he leaves tonight. Watch the monitor next to me George. Spacely: I can't come home now, I've got a business to run. Make that a failing business to run. No way I could make it home before six. Hey! What the? Good night sir. Have a pleasant evening. Good night sir? My watch must have stopped. R.U.D.I: Sorry George. I didn’t mean to leave you up in the air. George: Oh Who would have believed it? A mechanical Benedict Arnold! Come On will you Barn. You want us to miss the game? Fred: You aught to try walking in these high heels. How come I’ve got to be the woman? Fred: Well I'm doing the poker playing aren't I? Now all you gotta do is stand around looking sexy, to distract the other players. Barney: Like this? Forget it! Plan B, If you happen to see any of their hands, You could give me a signal like a if it's a bad hand, you giggle. Barney: Isn’t that cheating? Fred: What cheating? if you saw a guy holding cards that were laughable, you'd want to giggle wouldn't you? Barney: Well uh, Yeah I guess. So all I'm saying is, You can go ahead and giggle. And if you happen to see a hand that's a sure winner, uh, cough. Cough? What for? I’m not sick. Fred: You will be if you make us loose all the money for our vacation. How do I look Fred? Fred: Lucky I'm in disguise, cause the real me would never be seen in public with such an ugly girlfriend. Sorry, we're closed to the public tonight. Fred: Well ain't that a shame, me and my lovely ladywas looking for a charity bazaar, cause we got a whole mix of money here we'd love to throw around. uh you all. Welcome Stranger. Make way fellas, we got fresh money coming in. Always glad to welcome a new face in to the game. But not you! Sore hand. I just wanted to drop in not play.

Slate: I've never seen such dumb luck in my life Fred: He he he. Get smart enought to count the money. You nice gentlemen aren't leaving are you? I shoulda kept on dancing.

That old bald eagle thinks he can beat the best in the west. Ha ha ha! My deal. and this’ll be my pot. Uh, Honey Lamb, how about a drink of water? There's a pitcher right behind Mr. Slate.

Jane: Oh it can't be that bad dear. George: It's worse, The leak is my best friend. Astro: Me? George: No. my best friend R.U.D.I at the office. Well I’m sure Mr. Spacely doesn’t blame you. George: With his business in ruins? Just wait, he'll find some way. R.U.D.I is my responsibility. Diary: Go ahead run. But you can't run forever. I don't want to think about him, hear about him, or see him ever again. Just don't write about him and you'll make me happy Mom, I'm so miserable. I broke up with Rex! There there. Astro: You want to put your head on my shoulder George? No thanks, I haven't broken up with Mr. Spacely yet. Mr. Orbit: I don’t believe it! I saw it but I don't believe it. What don't you believe Henry? Mr. Orbit: What I saw. I don't believe it and I saw it. Elroy what’s going on in there? Mr. Orbit: You'll see it but you won't believe it. It works dad, You won't believe it, but it works. George: Ah huh. What is it? Elroy: It's my time travel machine. George: You’re right I don’t believe it works. Then how do you explain this? George: I don't have to explain it. You have to explain it. A young boy like you hiding a girl in the closet. I don’t know where I am! Please, help me master. Jane: George? What's going on in there? George: Now I may have to explain it. Jane: George? Elroy: Quick, put her here Dad. Jane: George is everything alright? Uh everything's fine dear. Jane: What was that? George: Oh That. ha ha, oh that's just Elroy's crazy time machine. Oh I don’t believe those things for a minute. Neither do I dear. Or do I? Wilma: I thought your vacations didn't start till next week. Fred: When you're a big wheel Wilma, The boss will let you off anytime. Let you go is more like it. Betty: But where are we going? You'll see when we get there Wilma: Well we’re sure not seeing much on the way. Men and their surprises. Barney: Yeah. I had a few of them this week myself. Fred: Quiet Barn. You girls wanted a vacation you're never gonna forget, Well you’re going to get one I just want peace and quiet and lie back and to be waited on hand and foot. Betty: Sounds good to me. Just leave me there. Fred: We're here. Betty: I don't hear any ukeleles. Wilma: Funny, I don't see any lovely Hula Hens. I should have left the blindfolds on. Fred: What are you grouching about girls? You wanted peace and quiet? you got it. Nature’s beauty is all around us. You know what they say in the song. The best things in life are free. And the worst husbands in life are cheap. Betty: Yeah. Fred: Okay so it isn’t the most expensive trip in the world. But you will be waited on hand and foot. Barney and I will put up the tents, do all the work, cook all the meals. and we've got enough food to feed and army. [Belch] Wilma: Enough for an army or a dogasaurus. Whichever gets there first. It works I tell you. You saw it Dad. George: Well I - i - saw something all right. Well even if it doesn't work, it'd be fun to pretend. I'd just love to go in to the future! Just to get away from Rex Saturn. and Mr. Spacely. It's almost worth a try. Great! Then 25th century here we come! Elroy are you sure we're going to the future? Uh, if you know what Imean. I know what you mean Dad, I got it said to the future. Astro: Hey what about me? Come on Astro, play let's pretend along with the rest of us. Astro: Oh boy Oh Boy. Thanks George. Hang On everybody! Jane: On to what? George: On to each other, just in case this darn thing works. Okay, Dinner everyone. Hey, Where'd everybody go? We wanna go home! Betty: Now. Fred: Give it a chance will you Wilma. What would you do at home work? What are you doing out here? Watching us work. You haven't got that tight enough Barn! Barney: That's as tight as I can get it Fred. Do I have to do everything? There. Now you see Girls? All you have to do is lie here in comfort and watch us... Yeow! Make fools out of yourselves. Betty: Like Wilma says, We wanna go home. Wilma: Now At least give us a chance to put up the tent. Wilma: Sure we'll give you the chance, but will they? Fred: Giant ants! Barney: and they're taking the tent. Fred: Come on, they're not getting away with it. Dino help! Help! No Dino No! not me! Them! Well what's next on our peaceful little vacation? Giant dinosaurs? Or some wild tribes that have never seen human beings before? Will you girls just relax. Whatever there is, we'll protect you. Now just go down by the stream and wash up. We'll put up the tent and get lunch. You think there are any wild tribes out there Fred? Fred: If there are we'll just scare them off like we did the wild ants. You scare them off. I'll stant here and shiver. What's that Fred? Fred: The end of our vacation! Let's go girls, you were right, we're going home. Barney: Last on in the car is a rotten dinosaur egg. We were just starting to enjoy ourselves. Fred: Well you can enjoy yourselves a lot more alive than dead. Are you out of your mind? What are you talking about? [stammering] B-b-back there, the -uh-uh -uh Would you like to give it a try Barney? Barney: Uh yeah, [stammering] the - the - the -the Well Betty, we know one thing. There's da- da- da- da over there. George: ooba dooba, that was some trip. Elroy: Wow. I wonder how far in the future we are. Jane: Or where we are. George: Or what planet. Judy: As long as there's boys. Astro: Well there's plenty of trees. Wilma: Whatever it is, I wanna see it. Wilma, I can't let you do it. Barney, you go first. Barney: I thought it was women and children first. I think I hear voices. Jane: Good. I can't wait to see what the people of the future look like. Jane, wait. With all those super vitamins and steroids, people of the future might be frightening. I'm not sure this is the right thing to do Wilma, Some of these primitive people are small and scare easy. Barney: not as easy as we do. Wilma: Comeon Fred, Dino will give you a boost and you can take a look. Fred; Okay, Okay. George: Uh, Okay, I'll use my anti gravity belt and see what I can see. Hold still Dino. Fred: Yeow! George: Yeow! It was one of them. I was right Jane, the future is filled with Giants! They're out of the past alright, some kind of crazy flying nuts. George: I'd say let's get out of here while there's still time. Jane: Just because they're big, who'se to say they're not friendly? Who'se to say they are? Wilma: Just because they can fly doesn't mean they're enemies. It doesn't mean they're not. Elroy: How are we going to know if they're friendly or not? George: Well I guess I'm gonna have to find that out son. Jane: George? George: By sending out man's best friend. Astro: I must resign from the club George: You can't resign. Elroy: Yeah. You're our guard dog. Banrey: What do we do Fred? Well we can't send the women out there and you're too chicken. Wilma: That only leaves one choice. Fred: That's right. Dino you're elected. Dino: Huh? [Grunting} [Barking] Run for your lives! You heard him let’s go! Dino: Wimpering Wilma: Like Master Like Pet. You got that righ. Come On. What are we running for dear? George: You heard Astro, for our lives. Elroy: Maybe they've gone. What are we doing Fred? They might not even be around anymore. He’s there. He’s peaking around from behind the tree. Yeah, with both heads. Elroy: There's two of them dad. Judy: Are they young and good looking? George: Wrong on both counts. Judy: Let me see. Holy Cow-asaurus! That guys third head is a girl. Well find out if one of those three heads knows how to talk! Fred: Okay, okay. Yabba Dabba Friend. George: Well one thing, the people of the future don't waste any words. Hey Dad, I think he said friend. Try it.. George: Ooba Dooba Friend Hey did you recognize that word Barn? Barney: Uh Which one? Ooba? or Dooba? He said "Friend". Come On, Let’s take a chance. Jane they're all coming out. Jane: They do look quanit don't they? Judy: Wow, I hope that's not the way our descendants are gonna look. Elroy: Maybe we’ve gone so far in the future, the time started over again. I wonder if they know any other words? Wilma: I bet they understand this... I love your dress. Jane: Well thank you. You must tell me who does your hair. Wilma you did it! Wilma: No big thing Fred, I just used the univerasl language. Fred: So this is it huh? This is how you got here? But where from? George: About a hundred miles up. Elroy: and a million years in the future. You must be tired after a trip like that. Barney: You never get tired with one of these! Some belt George. But how do I get down? Fred: Your usual way. By falling. Just press the button that says down. Fred: Don’t make it too complicated for him George! Woah! It didn't work, maybe it's this one. Or maybe it isn't. Fred: Forget the button. Just fall! I think I got it this time. It's the last button. Coming through! Did you get a load of that bird? - Ha ha ha, Yeah. Especially the beak! I think Barney was born in the wrong century for flying. Fred: With Barney, any century is the wrong century. Come on! You’re staying up there all day? Barney: Maybe even longer! I'm stuck! Help! Hey Dad, You can use the magnet guided gravity boots. Hey? How'd that little bag get so big? magic? Elroy: This is your average expandomatic travel bag. Hang on Barney, I'll be right with you. Fred: Well there's nothing average about that. Wilma: Jane aren’t you worried? He’s gonna fall! Jane: Oh he's used to it. I mean walking upside down. One of our favorite things at home is dancing on the ceiling. I think Daddy's got a new favorite now mom. Playing horsey back. Just call me tall in the saddle! You got something I can try here before you go home? Elroy: Practically anything Mr. Flintstone. I don't think we'll be leaving for a while. What's the problem Elroy? Elroy: I’m not sure dad. [Dino barking] Astro: I'll catch ya. I'll catch ya. George: I’m sorry about that Fred. Ah Gee whiz George. I almost had that ringaling Dinosaur. You just press this and you can stop anything. Fred: Boy this is sure some bag of goodies you got here. Yeah but what good are they if they can’t get us home. But they'll do us a lot of good if they stay around for a while. Just play along Barn. George: I don't know Elroy, we hadn't counted on coming to the past, Let alone staying in it. Jane: That’s right. I’m not even dressed for it. Judy: Well I wouldn't mind stying for a while. I'd like to see what the boys look like. You’re gonna get your chance. I think I can fix it, but it’s gonna take a while. No problemo. You'll come home with us. Won't they Wilma? Wilma: Of course. But won’t that interfere with your vacation? Wilma: That was over the minute we saw where they've taken us. Then it’s all settled. Our home is your home. and your bag is our bag he he he he. So this is an automobile. I read all about them in ancient history. They sure knew how to save fuel in the old days. But how did they save their legs? Jusy: This way mom. Jane: Judy that’s cheating. But it's a great idea. That’s okay Jane, we’ve got plenty of power up here. Well get you home faster than you can say Jack and Robertsone. Sure nice what you're doing for them Fred. Fred: What they're gonna do for us will be even nicer. The Slate Rock and Gravel Annual Picnic is coming up this weekend. Barney: Yeah without us, we’ve been fired remember? Barn, I also remember that Slate loses all the events to Turk Tarpit's company with monatenous regularities. Yeah. Not only that, he never wins. Fred: But if we have the Jetson's bag of goodies, he's winning this time. And we're winning our jobs back. Gee Fred, I hope we don’t lose for winning. Fred: Behold! Flintstone manner. How do you like it George? Got it on sale at Sears and Robrock. George: It’s very comfy. It's made of genuine shale. George: Uh, I kinda thought so. Fred: Now if you want to take a nap. Barney: That'll really put you to sleep. Fred: The main thing is we want you to be comfortable. George: Oh I am, we are. Fred: I hope Judy's enjoying her shower. [Judy screaming] George: Sounds like Judy. Fred: He he he. Well sometimes it's take the water a little time to warm up. But I bet you Wilma’s making Jane feel right at home in the kitchen. Exactly what is this Wilma? Uh, nevermind. Maybe I don't want to know. What you should know is [Jane screams] Wilma: Don't hold food over the pig a saurus disposal. George: Was that Jane? Barney: She just probably tried one of Wilma’s left overs. Fred: Very funny Barney. We're trying to make these people feel at home. George: Oh you are Fred. I just wish there was some way to repay you. Fred: Oh we’ll think of something. Hehe he he Come on George we’re a little late. George: Well I feel s little uh, That is this outfit is a little drafty.

Maybe they'll have a little talk with you when you get back and face Mr. Spacely. If we ever do get back. It's gonna be tough. Real tough. But we're gonna have to find the courage to live with it. Anything else I can help you with Mr. Flintstone sir? Uh, give me a minute I'll think of something. Oh that Jetson sure knew how to live. Barney: Hey Fred. Looky, I figured out how to get food out of this Thingamagig. Fred: Hey great! Barney: Now I gotta figure out how to get it off the walls. Or my face. Rosey: Oh dear, Oh dear. Off button, off button. Oh, uh, a little more of that bubbly water if you please. I wonder how the girls are doing Fred. Wilma: Yeow! Fred: Not as good as we are. Betty: Are you okay? Wilma: I will be whenI figure out which buttons to push on this hair styler. Betty: I didn't have to push any. I just opened the top of this funny box, called makeup, and the hands did the rest.

And for inviting all these fine movers and shakers of the universe to hear my surprising announcement. Spacely: Yours? Get out of my presentation. Cogswell Cogs has existed as long as time itself. and what better way to present this than through our dynamic spokesman, the Cogswell Caveman, Barney Rubble. the official spokesman for Cogswell Cogs. Great idea Cogswell. He stole it. Where do we sign up? Here with me. I'm getting over to the Cogwell plant right now. No! no! it's not fair! Oh please. I never had a chance. He’s stolen every idea I’ve had. As the official Cogs Caveman, I'd like to say... Fred: Say it fast cause the next things anyone's gonna hear is You yelling for help. Help! Fred: Ha I told you! George: Elroy! Somebody quick. Open the door. Dad. I didn't know you were working for the fire department. George: I - I own the fire department. Oh were you with a fire? George: Not this time. My anti gravity boots and I were up a tree, rescuing a helpless little sabertooth kitty who followed me... Home. Boy he almost got you dad. George: He didn't mean any harm Elroy. He he was just grateful. A little too grateful. Where's your father Elroy. Elroy; You're standing on him. Sorry dear, I didn't mean to walk all over you. George: That’s alright dear every body always has. I think I know how you feel. I've had it with everything, the department store, the beauty salons, the health spas an nothing but problems. Judy: No you can't come in! You can keep your groupies and Lose my phone number! Uh oh. [George grunts] I don't want any part of him. Well there may not be much left of your father. Gee I'm sorry Daddy, but I’m fed up! I know honey. I think we'd all like our old lives back again. But without the time machine it's hopeless. Orbit: I'll say this time machine is hopeless. Just can't be fixed. Rosey: Hopeless? Hopeless? Does not compute. Mr. Orbit, Hopeless is a word I do not have in my vocabulary bank. Orbit: I wish it wasn't in mine Rosey. But I’ve done everything a human knows how to do, and I can't get this thing to work. Then I think it's time for someone else to take over. R.U.D.I: The stone age? our George? Back in the stone age? Oh no! He's not equipped to handle that. No more than Mr. Orbit is to handle the time machine. You're a turbo asville Cosmos equation stethesary. You have the power to complete them. You also have another power. The power of caring for Mr. J That’s the power I haven’t been using lately. Rosey: Please R.U.D.I. Do it for both of us. R.U.D.I, who is that? R.U.D.I; Oh uh just an old friend. S.A.R.A Does that old know what we mean to each other? Well uh, not exactly. S.A.R.A: Well get rid of her right now. R.U.D.I: But, but S.A.R.A. Wait a minute. S.A.R.A: Right now. Rosey: I think I understand R.U.D.I. I guess an old friend like Mr. J doesn't mean as much as your new girlfriend. R.U.D.I: Wait Rosey. I'll help. We'll get Mr. J back. Hi there. You know me. I'm the Cogswell Cogs Caveman. Back in the stone age where I came from, We could only dream of Cogswell Cogs. But now that I've moved up a few centuries, I wouldn't want to be with out them. Well I'm gonna be without you! You Chisselor! Wilma: Fred! What are you doing? Fred: What I should have done weeks ago. That should have been me doing those commercials Hey look what fell out ot the window. Lucky I caught it. Too bad you didn't catch it on your head. Something bothering you Fred? Barney: Yeah you are! But no more! Wilma: Fred you can’t do that. Fred: Watch me. Barney: Woah! Wilma: But Fred, he's your firend. A friend who stole, cheated and sabbotaged me. Barney: Hey there's no land to land on! Wilma: Fred you would have done the same thing. How do you know? I didn't get the chance. Betty: Let go of my husband. Fred: Suits me. Yeow! Betty: Wilma's right Fred. You would have stole, cheated and sabbotaged Barney! So what? That's what he always does. What's the bud deal? Betty: Are you defending that caveman con artist? He's my caveman con artist. Fred: Uh girls? Betty: You keep out of this. Fred: But but but girls? Wilma: You heard her, Butt out! Betty: and as far as I'm concerned, You can both butt out of our lives from now on! Wilma: Oh! Suits me fine. Betty: Me too! Right Barn? Uh Barn? Oh! Barney! Barney: Do me a favor will you, Next time you fight over me, do it a little closer to the ground. Jane: No I don't know anything about alligator war seeings. I didn't even know I owned the lake. Besides, I'm exhausted. I just finished teaching aerobrocks at my health spas all six of them... George can you get the door? Uh, actually it got itself. Hi Mr. Goldbrick. You’re not smiling. We made a few bad investments at the bank. We're out of money and some of the depositors are a little anxious. Well I'm getting a little fed up myself Mr. Goldbrick. But more. Here. Here's everything I've got. The deed to the bank, The fire department, The condos and downtown Bedrock. Jane: George you can't do that. It's not fair to the rest of us. Jane they're my problems. I got a right to dump them if I want to. Only if we can dump ours too. Here's the department store, the beauty salon, the health spa and the Lake I don't even own. If your collecting troubles, You can have Iggy, the music store and the Rock Colloseum. Don't think it hasn't been fun Mr. Goldbrick. Move the cuatro quotient through gamma gamma to the sixth power. Of course! Why didn't I think of that? Rosey: Probably because you never heard of it. That's a good reason. Rosey: Cuatro quotient, gamma gamma to the sixth power. Correction made. Still no response from the control panels. R.U.D.I: I don't understand, it should compute. There's one possible solution. Have you turned the on switch? Rosey: Oh of course! Why didn’t I think of that? Probably because you never heard of it. We did it! Rosey: It worked! Yay! As George would say Ooba Dooba! Rosey: All systems are go! Which brings to mind one question. Who’s gonna go? I have the answer to that Mr. Orbit. It's my family. I'm the one who's gonna go. It's a dangerous trip Rosey. Orbit: Maybe too dangerous. [Mac Crying] Rosey: I love you too Mac. But my family took a chance and so will I. Orbit: I shouldn’t let you do it Rosey, but I’m proud of you. Good Luck Rosey. [Sigh] Some trip. That had a better kick than one of Mr. J's Jupitor Joy juice coctails. A lot better, with Mr. J's joy juice, you only fall off the couch. This must be a forest. Oh, bet Astro really loved this place. Mr. J? Mr. J? I'm here Mr. J Mr. J? Elroy? Judy? Mr. Jetson! - You there! Rosey: It’s me Rosey. Oh thank goodness they heard me. [horse neighs] - Out of my way Varmouth! ooh. Whenever this is, the robots not very friendly. Hand this bower or Prepare to die brother. Halt name. I'll bring you down. What made you drive all the way here George? I don't know Jane. I just wanted to get as far away from everything as I could. Well that's not far enough away from Iggy Sandstone. Elroy: Hey Dad, I think I recognize this place. Of course. It's the same place we landed in the time machine. Ha ha ha. How bout that! Ist that a coincidence? Gee. I was hoping the time machine was here. George: Hah. So was I son. I was hoping there was some way we could get away from that hectic life in Bedrock. Astro: I wanna get away from Ruffle breath. Astro: Go away! Get lost! [sighs] Well there’s no time machine, and no way outta here. So much for miracles that'll never happen. Let's Go. Are we stuck George? George: Yeah on a rock. Maybe it's an omen. George: Ha omen. You can forget the omen. Along with the miracles. Elroy: Like Time machines huh Dad? Mr. J! My family! Rosey! Oh Rosey! Rosey to the rescue! Who's gonna rescue Rosey? Rosey, Rosey I love you! I love affection, even if it kills me. ha ha and it may It’s just that we’re so glad to see you Rosey. Elroy: Not to mention the time machine. I'll drink to that. Rev it up Elroy. and let's get outta here! Yay! Wooga wooga! Wooga wooga! Wooga wooga! Well it's better than going around saying Polly wanna cracker? Judy please, I got something to talk to you about. Judy: You might as well be talking to yourself Iggy, cause I'm not listening Well then how about looking? Jane: Oh how lovely. Yes they are. But you see we’re kinda in a hurry Iggy. Well, it probably wont take very long if I just listen. Iggy: Judy I was wrong, those other girls, they were just fans. Sure. Your adoring fans. Just they kind you wanted. They kind I thought I wanted. But they didn't mean anything. Not like you do. If I could believe you meant that. Elroy: Ready to go dad. Right son. Uh Judy, sweetheart, we're ready to go. Daddy, do we have to go right now? George: If we don’t we’re liable to miss our chance. What about my chance? Here? Well honey, I guess we'll have to count on you making the right decision. It’s not fair. When two people finally find each other, The last thing they want is to be separated. Why do we have to be... Where are you going? Can I go with you? It's a long way Iggy. Maybe we’ll meet again sometime. Bye. I don’t want to hear the Jetsons are gone! I don't wanna hear Rosey's gone. [Mac crying] Looks like you're gone Mr. Spacely. Spcaely: put me down you mechanical monster. Put him down Mac. Mac and I are just a little upset Mr. Spacely. You see, Rosey went out to find the Jetsons, and now we can’t find her. [Mac crying] Who cares? Cogswell stole my best ideas. And How you ask? Jetson! He’s haunting me from a million years ago. I wish he were here to defend himself sir. Spacely: I don't care if he's here or not! [Spacely crying] Goerge: Cheer up Mr. Spacely! We're back! That's a lousy imitation Orbit. and not very funny. That's no imitation. They're back. Mac: Oh boy. Who? Who’s back? George: It's me boss. George Jetson. Thank you for those tears of Joy. I never thought I'd be saying this Mr. Spacely, but I’m sure glad to see you. What you're seeing is a ruined man Jetson. A man that you helped ruin. Excuse me Mr. Spacely. Dad could you help me in here? Sure son. Spacely: Who's gonna help me? What about my company, my reputation, My life? What am I going to do? What what what is that intreguing looking contracption? Elroy: It's called an automobile. A million years ago style. Spacely: That's not just an automobile Elroy. That’s a miracle. I can see it now. R.U.D.I: George! IT's so good to see you and your family home! George: Thanks R.U.D.I. Spacely: Pipe down you automated idiot. can't you see I'm on a roll? I can see it all now. George: Excuse me Mr. Spacely, Maybe you’d better not roll in front of R.U.D.I It's ok. R.U.D.I's back in the right circuits Mr. J. Without him we could have never gotten you back home. I'm back home too George. S.A.R.A's a thing of the past. I'm glad R.U.D.I, but please, don't mention the past. Anyway, who cares about the past? Unless you're using the past to make yourself a future. Cogswell: I had him on the ropes. I had him throught he ropes. What’s he doing over there? I'm afraid I don't know. Me, who's made sabotage a way of life. I can't let him get back in business now. I wish I could help sir. But as Humphrey Bogart once said, My sturry went straight. There must be somebody, someone who could get in to Spacely's plant. Ha ha! I think I know just the one. This will go down as the greatest idea since chocolate chip cookies. There it is. My ticket to fame and fortune. Nostalgia buffs all over the galaxy will go crazy for one of Spacely's Stone Aged Specials. He he he. How bout that? A stone Aged car is the wave in the future. If this goes off without a hitch Jetson, you may be in for a raise. Of don't worry sir. There'll be no leaks this time. Barney: Wow look at all the cars. Which one is yours Fred? Fred: I don't know this person. and I don't talk to persons I don't know. Sure you know me Fred. I’m the one you dropped out of the window. Wait a minute Rubble. What are you doing here? You're working for that coniving con man Cogswell. Announcer: Red alert there's a spy on the premises Red alert. He's working over time for Cogswell. Spying! Guys like you should be shot at dawn. No way Fred. I don't get up that early. Anyway, I could never be a Spy. I'm too chicken. [Astro barking] He's right look. George: It's Sentro! Spacely: Cogswell's Canine Contraption. He's taking pictures of the whole thing. I'm ruined! He's beat me again. Not yet Mr. Spacely. Fred: I'll chase him and you head him off. Hey wait for me. Come back you mechanical snoop. Yeow! Gotcha. Oops Ouch Sorry about that. Hang on to that Raftor. Darn it! We lost the spy. Come to Georgie! He’s getting away! Somebody stop him! Astro: Get him! Get him! Astro: Stop him Stop him! We did it! We did it! Sapcely: Woopie I'm back in business George. Yeah, those two make a pretty good team. Finally. Speaking of teams. You weren’t too bad back there yourself Barn. Helping me up on the raftor. Barney: It was nothing Fred. Fred: Nothing? You saved my life. What are friends for? Fred: Sometimes they're for hugging. That's what they're for. Spacely: They're going fast. You want one or not? Make up your mind Cogsy old boy. I’ve gotta have it! I’ve gotta have it. Then pay my price or be the only one in the galaxy who isn't driving one. Thta's a lot of money for nostalgia. Is it a deal or not? Cogswell: It's a deal. It's a deal. Spacely: Remember 've all the rights and patents. Everything. Copy one nut or bolt and I'll sue and take your whole plant. Jetson, I'm loving every moment of this. George: I'm glad sir. and you won't go unrewarded my boy. George: Hear that Jane? I could make you vice president. Or give you stock in the company. But I've come up with a better idea. Yes Sir? Spacely: I'm not gonna dock your pay for the time you were gone from your job. George: Oh uh. Thank you sir. It’s nice to see success hasn't changed Mr. Spacely. My aren't we Miss gloomy this evening? Judy: You would be too Rosey if you were alone. Haven't you noticed all the couples? You and Mac, Mom and Daddy, The Flintstones and Rubbles. and you're still thinking about that young fellow back at Bedrock. Well can you blame me? There wont be another one like him. Not in a million years. Excuse me Miss, would you join me for some refreshments? Judy: Oh! Well yes. A million years huh? Or maybe sooner. How do we look George? George: You look fine as long as I have the keys. Guess you're back in the fast lane again George. George: Thanks to you and your car Fred. Well the thanks we were looking for was your help in getting us back to the dirt lane. Yeah, we kinda miss Bedrock. Fred: Except for one thing. Nate Slate will never give us our jobs back I thought this would come in handy. Hey! You were a partner in Slate's Rock and Gravel Company? George: Which I'm now turning over to you. Yabba Dabba Doo! Barney: Fred! Whatchya doing? Got it. Bedrock, here we come. Elroy: I don't think so Mr. Rubble Fred: Say that again Elroy? The time machine. It took such a beating on that last trip, There's no way to fix it. You mean we're stuck here? In the Jet age? Forever? Barney: If we live that long. Cheer up Everybody. I've sold nearly every car in the plant. Spacely: Well maybe this'll make you cheer up. My next great ida is to go back to Bedrock... and get brontosauruses and tarantosauruses and every kind of dinosauruses we can find and... Sorry Boss it’ll never work. It’s too late. What! Don't tell me Cogswell's already done it. Will you stop with the shaking heads. It's It's the time machine Mr. Slate. It's Kaput. Barney. Uh Yeah, and they can’t kaput it back together again. Fred: and we're stuck here. The Jetson's have offered to put us up till we find a place of our own. But I know how you feel Wilma. It won't feel like home to you here. What about your old car. You can have it back. Fred: Oh it's very nice of you Mr. Spacely. I'll let you have it for uh... I'll let you have it for uh... for old times sake. at least I got a nod out of you. Oof! Yuck. Couldn't you have just nodded too? Well, this old car is the touch of home Fred. We'll see you later. Wilma: Thanks for everything. What happened George? Elroy: It's simple mom, they must have absorbed some of the time machine's cuatro quotient. Simpler than that Elroy. That old car wants to go home as much as they do. Oh Boy! Bedrock we're on our way. Barney: I can't wait to get home. Fred; So long George. George: Bye Fred, Barn. Jane: So long Wilma, Bye Betty. Astro: See ya around Dino! All: Bye! Fred: Yabba Dabba Doo!
