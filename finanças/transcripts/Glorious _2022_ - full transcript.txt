That was it. I didn't mean to disturb your thing there. My thing? You're focus on using the bathroom. Ah. A bathroom. Interesting. - Yeah. I guess. As far as bathrooms go, you got toilets, toilet paper. Usually. There's that. I'm assuming since I didn't get a good look on the way in... ...was kind of in a rush. I'd say you're forgetting two of the most important things here. The two of us. Huh? Yeah. And if I'm here and you're here, that means the potential for conversation. So three things. I don't really see conversation as being part of... Seems like a good place for it. It's quiet, private, and free from distraction. I'm not much of a bathroom talker. Okay? I hope you don't mind me asking. Are you recovering from inebriation? Yeah. Piss stinking inebriated. All by my lonesome at this rest stop here in... wherever the hell this rest stop is. It's a nice little statement on my life. Oh, shit. Something wrong? Yeah, I just rubbed my face after touching the toilet and God knows what else. - That's funny. - What is? God knows what else. What does it mean? It's just another way of saying I have no clue what foul shit is swimming around in my eyes right now. Oh, well, in that case, fecal matter, vomit particles, and the various remnants of semen, as well as 127 different strains of bacteria. Thanks. That's strangely specific. Not at all comforting. Would you like me to name them for you? - Not really. - Very well. There should be a sink out there if you want to freshen up. God only knows if it works. Sink's busted. Oh. - Oh, dear. Well, I apologize. Don't worry. I'm not blaming you unless you're the maintenance man or something. Unfortunately, I am not in charge of maintaining this establishment. Right now, I just want to wash the vomit out of my eyes. Remember, it's not just vomit. Yeah, I got it. Well, we've just had our first conversation. Turns out you might actually be a bathroom talker. You caught me on an off day. What do you mean by off day? I don't usually hang out in public restrooms with no pants on. Oh. So you're naked from the waist down? No. No, I-I got underwear on. You know, we've spoken quite a bit already, yet we don't know each other's names. That's true. Well? Wes. My name's Wes. Very nice to meet you, Wes. May I speak freely, Wes? Uh, sure. Would you mind stepping back into the stall? Yeah. No, I'm good. I'm good. You're not in the least bit curious as to what I have to say? I'm just not into conversations with random dudes hiding out in bathroom stalls. Yes, well, I wish I could do something about that, but unfortunately, this is where I find myself presently. You got like a stomach bug? Some things are beyond my control. Well, just hang in there, buddy. I'm sure it'll work itself out. I appreciate your optimism, Wes. Okay. Don't you want to know my name? Uh, sure. Now, in order to properly pronounce my name, I'll need you to do two things. First, stick out your tongue then grab the tip of it gently between your first finger and thumb. What the fuck? Seriously? I know it's a peculiar request, but I promise it is necessary. - Okay. - You're doing it? - Yeah. - Very good. I haven't had a chance to tell anyone my name for so long. I'm very excited. I'm glad I can help you out. Let's speed it up. Okay. So you're holding your tongue? - I'm holding my tongue. - Excellent. Excellent, excellent. Now repeat after me. Got another one. - Got another one? - Slow it down a bit. Slower and grip tighter. Gha... ta... no... tho... a. Yes, that's it! - Ghatanothoa? - Yes! What? Your... Your name is Ghatanothoa? Indeed it is. Sorry for the theatrics. I'm a bit of a stickler for proper enunciation. It's fine, man. It's... It's an interesting name. It's the name of a very lonely, very old god. That's who you were named after? So, like, hippie parents? Not quite. I am he. You are who? I am he. I am that god. Huh. Okay. So, what is this, some weird role playing shit? It's like a larping session. Do I get to pick a god name, too? How about Thor? Would you like me to call you Thor? So you're a god living in a rest stop bathroom in a stall that's glory hole adjacent. Is that it? I suppose in some mythologies, you could say demigod. Titan would be more accurate, but those are human constructs, limiting the full understanding of what I truly am, Thor. Yeah, Wes is fine. Don't do that! Do what? Do not attempt to look at me. This is your only warning, Wes. Is everything all right? Yeah. Yeah. Everything's great. Wes. What's that, baby? I told you not to look in the stall. The fuck? I warned you, Wes. No, no, no, no. Cut the shit. What the fuck was that? I'm trying to explain everything, If you would just... - Bullshit, asshole! Calm down. You saw me outside, huh? You saw me outside. You... you shot me up with something while I was passed out. And whatever you gave me is starting to kick in now. Right? - Don't be silly, Wes. - What was it? Heroin? PCP? Some experimental Russian hallucinogenic neurotoxin shit? Did you see her? See who? She's so tied to your misery that she's practically here with us now. You don't know shit. I know everything. In fact, I could provide you with the names of all 12 contributors to the fecal matter currently on your shirt, hands, and face. Would you like me to do so alphabetically or chronologically as to their date of contribution? You need help, man. Technically, Wes, I'm neither man nor woman. Why won't this door open? I'm sorry, but you're not going to be able to leave until we're done here. Are you doing this? Are you doing this?! What is this, some kind of remote locking mechanism? We're not finished. Open the fucking door! I'm sorry you're so upset. Help! Help me! Help! Help me! God dammit! You're very agitated, Wes. What's happening? It's a layer of protection to hide us. I don't like this. Are you agitated because you saw Brenda? What did you say? Judging by the tenor of your voice, you've clearly heard me. I told you this wasn't random. I knew you would walk in sad and miserable, tormented by regret, full of feelings you've never felt before. - Aaah! Looking for a way to make them all go away. Fuck you! I want out! Now! Now! Let me out, God dammit! Let me out! No one is coming to help you, friend. You're all alone. Just like you prefer. I'm not awake. I'm still passed out in the parking lot. Having a really vivid dream. - Wes, please. - A fucking nightmare. You know that's nonsense. A disease filled dreamland with a maniacal bathroom stall monster. God, whatever. It's all a dream! - Pull it together! - Ah! All right. Whoa. Makes me wish I had driven the extra 40 miles to the next rest stop. That wouldn't have helped. Why? Is there a troll living in that one? I've told you this isn't a chance meeting. You were driven here by an inescapable force. - Fate? - Yes, exactly, Wes. I am sorry for raising my voice before. It's been a long time since I've spoken to anyone. Yeah, you said that. Ugh. Careful. Please come back to the stall. We need to talk. Will you let me out if I do? I want so much to say yes, but I can't be certain. I don't want to make promises I can't keep. Well, that's ominous as fuck. It's the best I can offer. What if I don't like your offer? What choice do you have? What choice do I have? You can't escape, Wes. And consider what just occurred. Your only warning. You may not gaze upon me. Doing so will have grave consequences for you. What kind of grave consequences? To see my true form would turn you into a horrid, grotesque shell, devoid of humanity, a twisted affront to mankind, filling hearts with terror and fear. A maniacal being of pure madness. A creature so hideous it would make men cry out to the heavens, demanding God explain how something so foul could walk upon the earth. It would be a truly horrible existence. Okay. Yeah. I won't look into your hole. So what's a god like you doing in a place like this? - I beg your pardon? - It's just a little joke. Forget it. You like to make jokes when you're nervous? I do. Hey, did you hear the one about the guy stuck in the bathroom with a god? So you are nervous. Wouldn't you be if you were in my situation? I could never take your part in this. Our roles are very different. Lucky you. Man, it would be really great to know if I'm having a stroke or just plain crazy right now. It's neither. I'm sorry. What's funny? Uh, nothing. It's, uh... It's actually more amusing. I'm sorry. I hear that a lot. It's like an automatic response with no real meaning. You just throw it into a conversation whenever there's a pause. "I'm sorry." You fulfilled your human obligation for the day. I am being sincere when I say it. It can't be easy to be you right now. You didn't plan to end up here. You didn't plan to find me. But it was fated to happen here at this exact moment. Isn't fate just someone else's plan? In this instance, yes. So who's plan this is? yours? No. I'm a piece of this, just as you are. You can say we were both chosen. So, why me? Believe me, Wes, if it was up to me, I'd let you walk out that door right now. So, who's it up to? I'm sure you felt something strange in the air. A change in the pressure, a wind that doesn't blow quite right. The ground not as firm as it once was. Just breathe. That's how it begins. And then this feeling grows in your premonition. That feeling is what has been pulling you and I towards one another, a force greater than gravity has merged us into one synchronistic orbit. Our planes have rotated on to the same axis. There's no way out, Wes. I have no clue what the fuck is going on... Please accept that some things are beyond your comprehension. What happened to the mood lighting? My powers are getting weaker, making it harder for me to conceal our location. I need to conserve my strength. Can you just tell me what do I need to do to get out of here? The universe has a favor to ask. A favor? So, what is it? Does the universe need help moving? Hm? Or maybe the universe just needs a couple bucks. I think I torched my wallet last night, but there might be some change in between my car seats. A fucking favor?! This is coming from the same universe that's been taking a dump on me for some time, man! You repeatedly blame the universe for your problems, Wes. Why haven't you taken responsibility for your own actions? You don't know me. You don't know anything about me, pal. We both know that's not true. Tell me about that knot in the pit of your stomach. What did you do, Wes? This... this is bullshit. I know this isn't easy for you. Just give me a minute. I need you to focus on the present. Just give me a goddamn minute. You can't be here. You have to go. Now! Stay out of my head! You can't hide in your memories. The hell I can't. I need your mind here with me. You said I was different. You said she was different. - Shut up. - You said she was different. - You said I was different. - You said she was... You said she was different. - You said I was different. - You said she was different. - Shut up! - You said I was different. - You said she was different. - You said I was different. - You said she was different. I told you not to go back there. That's not fair. You have no concept of fair. I said stop, now! You will stay here, and you will listen to what I have to say! Wes? I'll stop. But you cannot leave, Wes. Not even into your memories. How about a story? Fuck you. Once there was a being of pure energy all alone in an ocean of infinite nothing. Until it discovered the power to give physical form to its thoughts and feelings. This power disturbed... Oh, sorry, the whole ear bleeding thing really freaked me out, and I had to... I had to go. I'm still listening. This power dis... Unbelievable. This power... Are you done? I'm done. Continue. This power disturbed him greatly. It just couldn't stop these thoughts and feelings from filling the empty void. They became his unwanted children. Enraged by their presence, he set out to destroy them. During the conflict, his oldest child sliced through his side. The blood that flowed from the wound filled the infinite nothing, becoming the planets and the stars and life. He watched in horror as his precious void filled with feelings. He begged his children to close the wound, to stop any more new life from forming. His children agreed, but only if he would let this new life continue to exist. He conceded. But he so loathed humanity that he secretly created a being of pure destruction, capable of undoing all life and returning back to the infinite nothing. He created... me. Doing so greatly weakened him, allowing my siblings to overpower him and lock him away in the deepest, darkest pit in the deepest, darkest ocean. Then they hid me away in the ether. And there I remained until now. Am I... in Hell? What do you think Hell is? I used to think it was other people. And this here makes a pretty compelling case. All cultures believe in some kind of hell, just as they believe in some kind of God. I wonder how many of them believe God hangs out in rest stop bathrooms waiting to blow up the world. I don't want that to happen, Wes. I want to stop this. I've started feeling a connection to life and humanity. I'm starting to enter into my corporeal presence. Yeah. You feeling all right in there? My power to hide from my father is fading. He's already broken free from his prison and is searching for me. Once I fully enter into the material world, I'll fulfill my father's purpose for me... The total annihilation of all life in the universe. The total annihilation of all life in the universe? And only you can stop my transformation. Only you can give me what I need to return to my ethereal form. I need you to satisfy these feelings that have awakened to me. Quiet them. There's only one part of you that can do that. We're continuing to study the works of the great masters. And today we are discussing the artist Shahud. Most well-known for his elaborate sculptures and surrealistic vases, he's considered to be the founder of what would... Hey! Wes, stop. Is someone out there?! Depicting several nude figures dancing atop a three legged elk. Goddamn kids. This will not end well, Wes. Anybody! The pieces remain edible to this very day. Hello?! The head was found several days later. Help! ...of abstract statues. Many of which feel modern in nature. The countryside led to an exploration of haystacks, and he began to incorporate these pastoral qualities into his cubist seascapes. These works continued to receive little or no attention. Please! Help! What the hell is this door locked? Someone in there? Do not answer him. You don't want this, Wes. I'm in here! Open the door. Now! Listen, I've been trying to get it open all day, sir. It's... it's stuck! There will be consequences. Let me the hell in. Open the door, Ghat. So be it. - The door! - Hold it there. Don't let the door... Ah! What the hell is going on in here? Why are you blocking the door? And where the hell are your pants? It's a very long story. Did you sleep in here last night? Passed out. Are you the maintenance man? I'm the property supervisor. Gary. I see. Sir, it is an absolute pleasure to meet you. You don't have a crowbar on you, do you? What the hell are you talking about? Why the hell won't this... Did you do something to this door? Look, I didn't do anything, I swear. Well, then who the hell is responsible? I am. Oh, you have a friend in here. You know, there are hotels all up and down the stretch of road. Plenty of cheap ones, too. No, no, it's... It's not like that, Gary. Well, whatever the hell it's like, just get this damn door open and y'all move on up out of here. - Sounds great. I'm afraid that's not going to happen, Gary. And why is that, fella? You're a part of this now. Oh, no. No, no. No. No, Ghat. Listen, I got an idea. How about you open the door, let me out. Then you can explain all of this to Gary. And hey, maybe Gary can satisfy your corporeal-ness. Gary has a different part to play in this. The hell I do. I'm calling the police. Good idea. Let's do that. Do you think talking to the police is wise, given your situation? Hey, maybe you can let me call a cab first. Just a quick... Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. You stay right there. - Okay. Can't get a signal. I don't think Gary is aware of the danger he's in. Yeah. Yeah, I'm real scared now. Excuse me, sir. There we go. Hang up the phone, Gary. - Gary. - One second. - I said... - Hang up the phone! What the hell you got going on here? I-I don't know this guy. I've had a seriously messed up couple of days, and I just want to go home. He's the man you need to speak to. Go get him, Gary. - All right, you, party's over. - Party's over! You open up this door right now, and the both of y'all get on y'all way. - No! - Listen to Gary, Ghat. As long as he is here, he is a hindrance to what needs to be done. Then let him stay and do whatever it is you need. You were chosen for this. As for Gary, now that he's here, I can't let him leave. He may tell someone what he's seen. That will bring a risk of further interference. I can't have that. Wait, wait. What... What are you going to do? What has to be done now. Look, I'm not going to ask you again, freak. Let me the fuck out of here! Wes, step into the stall. I'll take care of everything. Wes! I'm sorry. What the hell is happening with the lights? Oh, my God. Yes. Gary! Hang on to me! Please stop! Stalk much? Are you stalking her? No. I'm just joking. I'm just joking. I don't really think you're her type anyway. Why? Well, she's... She's pretty hot. I can see why you'd go for her, but... But she wouldn't go for me, you think? You think you got to look at the eyes. I mean, she's... she's really trying to explore all of her options still. And I'm not... I'm not? No. You think that's what you want. But I see someone that's ready to settle down. Are you... are you offering? Whoa. We just met, dude. Actually, we haven't. I'm Wes. Brenda. Brenda. It's nice to meet you, Brenda. Nice to meet you, too, Wes. Brenda. There's something about them, the fact they can go from being so full of life so quickly. Wouldn't you agree? Wes? I'm glad you find us so fascinating. I feel like we've both learned something from this experience. What's that? Exactly what my corporeal form is capable of. I need to move around a bit. I do apologize about the mess. I may have gotten a bit carried away. No. I'd like to think he'd be happier knowing how important his sacrifice was. Too bad you can't ask him. Why? I told you the fate of all life in the universe is at stake here. I can't let anyone stand in the way of what we need to do. What do we need to? Specifically, what do I need to do to end this fucking nightmare?! You need to satisfy my physical form. And that's it? - Of course. - And then I can go? Yes. I don't think I can. I believe in you, Wes. I believe you can rise to the occasion. Once you have given me what I need, your part of the ritual will be complete. You can do it. I will then release my hold on you. I know. It's a lot to ask. I can't. Once we are done here, I will return to my ethereal form. My father will no longer be able to find me. It's for the universe, Wes, the whole universe. Even now, I can feel his presence. This is not my happy place. It took a great deal of his strength to escape. In his current state, my brothers and sisters will have no trouble returning him to his prison. Let's go, Gary! Once he is locked away, the universe will be safe. If there's anyone out there... But he grows stronger with every passing moment. That's why it's so important we do this now. Fuck it. Let's do this. It's a great service you're performing here, Wes. A service no one but you can perform. Okay. If you could just be quiet. Of course. Ah. What the hell is that? What? Well, I thought... You thought your human penis was going to save the universe? The way you were... Your genitals are of no significance. Well, you don't have to be mean about it! So what exactly do you want from me, then? I need your liver, Wes. Wait. What? My... my liver? Yes. A piece of it will do. Yeah, but I kind of need it. I'm not asking for all of it. You could live a perfectly normal life with just 25%. It does regenerate. - 25%? - Might I remind you you were perfectly willing to give me your penis a few moments ago. I wasn't going to give you... Let's just move past that. How, Ghat? How do you expect me to give you my liver? It is inside me. Hm? What, you got a doctor in there with you? I'm afraid not. This sacrifice must be given to me by you willingly. Holy shit. You're fucking nuts. I'm not doing it. I don't care how many people it saves. Oh. Oh. This is no time to be selfish. Selfish? Selfish? Listen, you're talking about cutting out a major organ, man. Excuse me for being a tad selfish. It's a moment of pain and discomfort in exchange for all life in the universe. If you don't do this, you and everyone else will die. What could be more selfish? Well, I guess we're all just a bunch of selfish assholes. Might as well let us all die. I don't believe that. Humanity is full of unselfish acts of self-sacrifice. Then I got news for you, pal. All those unselfish acts were done for selfish reasons. - You're wrong. - Am I? How about I tell you a story? We don't have time for that. It's my liver you want. So you're going to listen to my story. Once upon a time, there was my dad. He worked a good paying job, making enough so my mom didn't have to work. But God damn, he made sure we knew every fucking dime that came into that house came from him. He especially liked letting my mom know. He used it as an excuse to torment her, berating her in public, cheating on her. You know what he said to me after she blew her brains out? He said, "Son, she was a selfish woman." This is not a productive use of our time. You see, taking care of me and my mom seems totally unselfish, but for him, it was just a way to force her to put up with his shit. - Wes, I... - So don't think for a second that all those do gooding assholes out there don't have ulterior motives. - Wes... - Even Mother Teresa was just out to get a little first class upgrade on her ticket to Heaven. - I understand. - No, you don't! So let me be clear. Kindness, generosity... No, in the end, it's all about control. It's all about dominance. A way to show you are better than everyone else. So don't come at me with that altruism bullshit because I grew up with a dear old dad who had a black belt in that shit! Don't you at least want to feel good about something in your life? I stopped feeling a long time ago. He's close, Wes. It's kind of beautiful. Like a vast expansion of nothing. What you said is not true. What's not true? That you stopped feeling. It's the first time in a long time, but you're feeling something right now, and it frightens you. Would you do it for her? I thought she was perfect. Thought she was the one who would fill the nothing inside me. Just make me normal. But she wasn't. Just like that, she was like all the others. She didn't look at you like the others. You thought she would, but she didn't. She was hurt. She was heartbroken. She trusted you. I love you, Wes. And you broke that trust. You devastated her. You broke her heart. You felt that pain, and you cannot stop feeling it. Fuck you! I love you very much. I love you very much. I love you very much. Aaah! Never felt pain like in my life. It was the smallest fraction of what I'm capable of. I think I pissed myself. You did a little. I feel like death. I'm sorry I had to do that, but I warned you. I look like death. Wes. I look like death. Are you all right? I look like death. Please stop. I'm gonna die here. You're wasting time with these games. Wasting time? Well, then let's pick up the pace, shall we? Daddy?! What are you doing? You're looking for your son, right? He's here. And he's been a bad boy, Daddy! Stop that! Come get him. What was that? He's found us. Aaah! Ah! I can't protect us much longer. You can't let it end like this. Her memory has to be worth something. If the world goes away, she goes away with it. There won't be anyone left to remember her. Memories are curious. They fade over time. Or they can be taken from you. It's hard when you can't recall something that was so important. A face that once made you so happy. Robbed from your memory forever. Why did you take her away? So you can see what's at stake. Just one more time. Please. I'll do what you want. And I'll give you what you asked. Let me see her one more time. Please. Very well. - Hi. - Hey. What's this? Um, two months, three days, 10 hours anniversary present. Oh, my God. I totally forgot. I'm going to run out right now and get you stuff. No, no. It's too late. Just open it. It's fine. Squeeze it. Okay. I love you very much. I think that bear might be on to something. Thank you. She was happy. And? And I was happy with her. And that frightened you. Even now, your feelings tear you up inside. Feelings of loneliness, love, compassion, hate all fighting within you. Pure and raw. Locked away inside you. That's what I need from you. Let her live on. Will it hurt? Very much. It's on the other side, Wes. Ah. - Hurry, Wes. - Oh, please make it stop! You have to finish. Aaah! What is this? Ghat? It is finished. I have returned to the ether. The threat has passed. I saved the universe. I'm a hero. No. Heroes are remembered. You will be forgotten. And that's what you deserve. - No. - It's what we both deserve. We are beings of pure destruction, Wes. You and I don't belong in this beautiful world. Goodbye, Wes.
