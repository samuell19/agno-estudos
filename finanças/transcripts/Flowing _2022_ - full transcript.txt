[buzz, drip] [thud] [sinister noise] [sizzle] [man] Giacomo! Oh, and answer! But what's up, that shit there too? [boiling water] [coughing] [man] Giacomo! James! Imbecile! [whispers] [thud] [continues whispering] [woman] Is it long until the hotel? Few minutes. [softly] Why is it so slow? [effort verses] Enough, it hurts too much. [voices from TV] [girl] What are you doing at school today? - Classwork, child. - I too have a test in class. Hard, huh? - [girl] What an idiot. - [boy] What an idiot? [sighs] [falling objects] [woman] Fuck you! - Good morning their way. - [smiles] [distant noises and screams] [mobile alarm clock] Barbara and I are late. - Are you going to Ferrini's? - No. - Why? - I'm late too. - Hello, beautiful girl. - HI. [voices from TV] It's homework. [girl] Yesterday the teacher wrote a note to Carlotta. [man] Why? Because she was explaining the Babylonians and Charlotte started using her cell phone. - [boy] You have to go! - Stopped! I'll call the police! What the fuck are you doing? Send him away! - Get out! - Oh! Dad, what do you want from Helver? - [girl] Get off! - [boy] Send him away! - Get off! But what did he do to you? - He can't stay here, period. Go fuck yourself to Termini to stink with your friends. Are not you ashamed? You dickhead, leave him alone! [she breathes heavily] - What did you call me, little girl? - Calm down. - How do you make this Mongoloid talk? - Get out. And don't bother him, she didn't do anything to you. Give it a go. You know what I'm doing to you. Shit ticks, see what happens to you. [man] We have physio after school. [girl snorts] [girl] We go there anyway and nothing ever happens. [man] We're going to physiotherapy today and I don't want to hear a fly. [girl] Okay. - Look, you're not doing me a favor. - [woman] Thomas! Hi Marinella. I'll take the princess to class. No, my pleasure. But no, you always have so much to do, don't worry. - Little girls! Wait for me, huh! - Hi love. - [girl] Hello! - On purpose! I wanted to show you. [laughing] It's been online since yesterday. What do you think about it? It turned out well. Just think we have reservations for Easter as well, it's incredible! Anyway, I'm going now it's late. You are our guests one of these weekends. What do you say? - Huh? - It's an idea. [trap music] Kid! If you put it back right away, I'll pretend I didn't see. Where will we end up? Fuck you, lady. How do you have to go. This old shit, fucking with me. [softly] This shitty old woman must piss me off. Old shit, you damn ... [Thomas] Ma'am, I'm asking you a favor. I have two things on the cross. [woman] I'm sorry, I'm in a hurry too. I only have these to pay. - I am not interested. - I'm late. They're waiting for me due to a medical need, but that's fine. All right! [voices over loudspeaker] [coughs] [man] I thought you weren't coming anymore. Sometimes I envy her. From inside he doesn't notice what the people outside have become. do you envy me? [door opens] Oh! The French has arrived! Now you're happy, huh, dad? You have to see how she screams when I change her drip. You do it first, you kill me. So you sell the shack and throw away all the money. The injection makes him talk a lot of bullshit. Take care of it yourself. The worst thing about not being able to move is seeing him there all day waiting for me to iron. What's wrong with you, huh? Thoughts. - Scattered thoughts. - Ugly? Almost all. With the vintage you've had, you're a flower, trust me. You have health, a job, two children. - It was better before. - Huh? It was better before? But in life it's always better first. [mobile alarm clock] - Are you going to cut this alarm clock? - And how do I do this? - These are my days. - And what about your day? - Housekeeping. - Oh. Do you know what? I would really like you as a wife. [smiles] It doesn't suit you. I no longer remember how love is made. [chuckles] [coughs] [inhales deeply] [knock on door] [trap music from cell phone] [boy 1] Ball! - Ball! - [boy 2] Oh, awake! Ball, thank you! - But who is deaf? - Dry, ball, come on. Here, good. [in Roman dialect] Come on, though, hurry up! Oh, what the fuck are you doing? [boy 2] Why are we all stoned? - What's he doing with the phone? - Put that thing down. - Put it down. But what the fuck are you doing? - Pick up the phone... Go get the ball before we beat you up! [music volume increases] Come on, what the fuck! [crossed voices] - Asshole! - Come here! [Achille Lauro's "Thoiry" plays] Shh! [explosion] [sighs] Now all of you go fuck yourself. [man] Sorry, what are you doing? Oh, look, if you don't leave, I'm going to have to call the police. [in Roman dialect] It's these cocks. Listen, do me a favor, go away. I ask you please. Let me understand. You're a security guard inside an abandoned swimming pool. - They pay me. - They pay you. And how much do they pay you? Is it loaded? That? I can't believe you can shoot. You? Shooting? Shoot you? Shoot. In fact, why don't you shoot me? She shoots me. - I don't want to shoot you. - Of course you don't want to. You can not do this. You are an asshole. Do you know what the thing is? Who think you're so superheroes with this beautiful uniform, the gun, the walkie-talkie, the belt. With this big fucking face you have, huh? [laughs] But you're nothing. You're in bad shape, little brother. HI. Oh, check, I don't want that... [bottle breaks] [dial tone] Hey, hi. How are you? [indistinct voice from cell phone] Listen, what are you saying, step? Yes now. Come on come on. [Soccer] Come on, please, it's also going to rain, I'll hurry. [sighs] Okay, okay. I'm coming, I'm coming. [gasps] [woman] Relax. [crows of pleasure] [crows of pleasure intensifies] [woman] What did you do today? [indistinct voices from cell phone] You'll end up getting beaten to death. A lot... But doesn't your father tell you anything? Once upon a time he would have been pissed off. And now? What should someone who has succeeded in a family tell me? I don't give a shit about anyone. I only care about Barbara. And about you. Do you like the sea? Of course I like it. - Then I'll buy you a house by the sea. - Where? - In Santa Marinella? - Wherever you want. - And where do you get the money? - I don't know, somehow I do. mmm. Why don't you marry me? Come on. On. Give me these 50 euros, another one is coming. Yes. They are in the jacket, take them. I piss and go. So I leave you to your other. Because the TV volume in the house was too loud. Mara Pannone live. Look what happened. Mara} The volume of the television too high, the spark that would have ignited a quarrel that ended dramatically late yesterday morning in via degli Ausoni, San Lorenzo district, Rome. [mobile alarm clock] A 75-year-old man stabbed his 25- and 26-year-old sons. He stabbed them one in the chest and one in the abdomen with a kitchen knife. [screams] According to an initial reconstruction, the seventy-five year old... [mobile alarm clock] [screams from the neighbors] Mara} Stormy relationships. Frequent tensions. They were at the table. He would have turned on the TV loudly, his son would have asked him to turn it off ... [woman cries] [noises, screams] Yes what is it? Do you realize that you scream from morning to night? - Sorry, really. - I'll call the police if you don't stop. I'm mortified, sorry. [woman groans] My wife is sick, she suffers from violent depression. - Is there anything I can do? - Unfortunately no. No, don't enter! Don't come in, please. [woman cries, she moans] [Thomas] Ma'am... [woman screams] [man] Go! Come away! We won't disturb you again, but now leave us alone! [coughs] [Drips] [sizzles] What the fuck are you? [coughing] [knocking on the door] Did you fall in the toilet? Move. [sniffs at her] Don't worry, Barbara. [woman] Progress is slower than we thought. Barbara has great willpower, but she needs something more. It seems to me that she doesn't care. She seems to me that she does it just for me. She is normal. The children react like this. At that age, the pressures tend to make them close in on themselves. I want to see her walk again. [in modified voice] The truth is, you don't drive with a headache. There is a risk of getting hurt. As she said she? That we can be confident. Then mom gave me some of this, but I don't know what it is. Chicken. Do you like it? [girl speaks indistinctly] [thud] [man] Stop! Bastard, stop! [door closes] [gasps] [spoon hits plate] If you don't like it, next time you cook. I didn't say anything. She is very good. [Thomas sighs] [door closes] Why are you and Enrico doing this? You know, we are two boys under the same roof. You must have a lot of patience, huh? But mom is not happy if you fight. It's not easy, Barbie. [Barbara] Do you love Enrico? Of course I love him. - So why don't you talk to each other anymore? - It is not true. [sighs] I do what I can, love. But Enrico doesn't reason. He just does stupid things. He does not know the meaning of the limit. I don't know the meaning of the limit, pa'? - Close immediately the heat comes out! - No, repeat. "Enrico doesn't reason, he does stupid things..." Repeat. - Try again to scare your sister... - What are you doing? do you lead me? Huh? Better beat me instead of making this shit face every day. - Go to your room. - Go to your room. Can you just say this? Do you know that I pity you? With these fucking alarm clocks, I really pity you. You fucked everything up when mom... I won't tell you again, Enri'. It's always my fault anyway. It will always be my fault. If you do a shitty job it's my fault, if you cook like shit it's my fault, if you're a shitty loser it's my fault. You are only to blame for one. [sound of objects falling] [blow] You piece of shit. Fuck you. Maybe you die. Piece of shit. Thank you. And remember the money, which you didn't take yesterday. Are too many. Leave pride alone, which always loses out in the end. Come on. [bell rang repeatedly] - What the fuck... - What the fuck you! I am working. - But can I come in? - No! - Alright, can you let me in? - No you can not. - Come on, let me in. I beg you. - No. [man] What the fuck are you doing? Do you move? Enrico, I don't know what you're looking for. But it's not me. [crying] [rain falling] [voicemail sign] Dearest, how are you? I don't want to disturb you... [signal delete message] Dearest, sorry about the time, I don't want to disturb you, but I wanted you... [signal delete message] Dearest, I hope you are well. I wanted to tell you… [delete message signal] Dearest, can I disturb you? I wanted to tell you something, but given the time... [delete message signal] Darling, I wanted to tell you about the concert, can I call you? [woman] But how do you drive? [woman whimpers] You are suspended until further notice. We have to respond to a passenger complaint. But they cut me off. We were about to have a crazy accident, I braked in time. Did you get the license plate? No. And there are no witnesses, that I know of. You can't suspend me. It's not the time. Look, Thomas, I know you're not in the business, you've had a difficult year, and I'm the first to regret it. Do you regret? Stay at home for a while. Stay with the boys, get some rest. Look, I rest everything tomorrow. Huh? - But I can't... - Thomas, please. - I can't not work. - Enough. - I have two sons. - Please. I beg you. - I beg you. - Enough. Shit! [wakes up] Dad.“ [Barbara] Sorry if I was sad yesterday. I had a beautiful dream, now I'm much better. And are you better? - Can we have breakfast earlier? - No my love. Dad, what are you doing? Dad! Dad, I'm scared! You seem to like it. [Barbara groans] She seems to have gotten used to that chair. Thats enough. Just make everything right for you. Just smile. There is nothing to smile about. You gotta keep those legs straight! [groaning] Dad... I can't stand seeing you like this anymore. She drives me crazy. - Dad... - It drives me crazy. - Please... - I feel like killing him! Dad! Love? Excuse me. Excuse me. I want to walk, dad. I know honey. Can we have breakfast? Sure, my love. Certain. And can you make peace with Enrico? [Crybaby] - [Barbara] Hello. - [Enrico] Good morning, child. [Barbara] Your breath stinks. I think it's yours coming back in your nose. - Stop that. - Maybe it's the feet. Your feet stink. Feel the smell of feet. Your feet stink. You washed up this morning, huh? I have breakfast in front of school. But it's yummy. [Barbara] Dad? Shall we take Enrico to school today? Radio woman} Hours of blood in Rome, after the violent clashes that last night led to the death of as many as eight people. Around 06:00, an AMA truck hit a motorcyclist on the Appia. This is added to other episodes of the same tenor that have shocked the capital in recent days. Not far away, in via Ruggero Bonghi, a tragedy took place in a beauty salon, where the owner struck the partner with 17 stab wounds in the chest. The man bled to death even earlier... [Barbara] Dad, can you turn it off? - On site are going... - Dad, please, can you turn it off? Dad, please! The madness that has taken over the city... Dad! [softly] Thank you. It scared me. [horn] [man] Oh, are you moving? It is green! [mobile alarm clock] [indistinct voices of boys] [Bell] Bro! Are you alive! Hello, Gianlu'. [Gianluca] How fucking I missed you, bro. Come on, when others see you, a mess happens, let's go in! I'm not going in, Gianlu'. I'm just here to please my sister. Make me happy too, right? Alright. At least text me back so you can tell me what the fuck you do all day. If you want, I'll tell you now. [they laugh] Gianlu', come here! [sound of effort] [screams] Ah! [Gianluca] But what is the meaning? - [Enrico] Does he have to have it? - Sure. [Enrìco] So think of it as philosophy. - [Gianluca] That is? - That is... - {Gìanluca} Are you Socrates? - Let me talk! I think nobody gives a shit about anyone, that's it. But we are all forced to be together. Is that right? [Gianluca] Mmm... boh. No? [Henry] No, trust me. It is not so. I know, it's bad to say. But honestly... I don't feel like smiling at the cashier, to give way to the old people on the bus, to stand in lines, to do homework, to be kind and nice, because I'm not kind and nice. I want to do whatever the fuck I want. We all die in the end. - And then you steal the dummies from the Chinese. - Exact. You say you don't give a fuck about anything and then you look for applause on that group? I'm not looking for applause from anyone. - What are you looking for? - Nothing. [sniffles] Do you want? No, I don't want it. [falling objects] - Your sister? - It grows. Is your father still a home cook? What a shit when I asked him if it was McDonald's and... Look, make me a video. - Which video? - Make me a video. [camera start signal] [gagging] What are you doing? [laughs] - And laughs. - Do it yourself, Gianlu'! Hold. - No. - Come on, do it, Gianlu'! I don't vomit in the middle of the pool! - Come on, do it! - I don't vomit... We used to do everything together. - What the fuck were we doing together? - All! - What the fuck is everything? - All. The reeds on the little park? Playing PlayStation at home? - What the fuck is it? Tell me. Explain me. - Go stoned yourself with Play. Don't let me hear you again, you fucked me up! Keep your hands off me. You look like a psychopath. - You have to shut up, Gianlu'! - But don't tell me to shut up! You have to shut up, Gianlu'! - Fuck you. - Go fuck yourself! Dick head. - You think too much with this brain. - And you don't think about shit! - Come here! - You're in bad shape, Gianlu'. Listen, come here. Oh! Come here! Stop! Do you want to talk? I'm here, let's talk. Just don't be fucking crazy. I don't throw up in the pool, but if you want to do something we do it, we haven't seen each other in a while. What the fuck. - Let's wait here another hour. - To do what? Did you say you were silent? Here, shut up. I do not know if I can. Then there is no one who can give me the change. I won't be long. I need. [Thomas] It was 03:30, 03:35. - I can? - Yes, please. But are you sure that someone cut you off? Certain. He wouldn't be the first to see things these days. - Meaning what? - But no, nothing. Conspiracy theorist bullshit. The smoke that comes out of the manhole covers when it rains. There's one who breathed it in and made a huge post on Facebook where he says she's started seeing some weird things. Everyone is sharing it. But it's bullshit, like chemtrails, these things here. [Bell] Shit. I'll go see who he is. [mouse click] [woman] Go with a second step. [thud] [clock ticking] [indistinct voices] Dad, what's going on? [puts on the brake] I do not know. I'll be right there. [indistinct voices] Please stand back. One moment, lady. Only a moment. [man] did you know him? [woman in Roman dialect] Poor. Helver. It was that animal. I'm sure. And nobody will do anything. On the contrary. Dad? We park in the garage. [Barbara screaming] Dad! Here [Thomas] I don't know. Dad, here too! [Thomas] Don't breathe this stuff. I'm going to Ferrini's. - No, dad... - You stay in your room! [sound of quick footsteps] [door opens and closes] Mr. Ferrini? [man] he is dead. Do you want to know what's the last thing he said before he died? Your name. Your name. Your name. Your name. Your name. Your name. Your name. Your name. Your name. Your name. Your name. I lure him, you go from behind him and take his gun. - Fuck it. - You are scared? -No, he's an asshole. He has a heart attack. - I get it, you're scared. - Oh, I'm not afraid! - Then you're an asshole. The walkie-talkie to the fullest. - What the fuck are we doing? - The walkie-talkie or nothing. - Alright. Go around the pool. - Okay. Don't shit underneath. What do you say, brothers'? You recovered, huh? Do you want to become famous? Oh, down... Lower the gun. Stop, Gianlu'! [groaning] [whining] [groaning] [Enrico crying] It was just a joke. It was a joke. Gianlu'... Gianlu'? [crying] [dial tone] [mobile phone rings] [Thomas' voice] Tell me. Dad. I screwed up, dad. [mobile phone rings] [Enrico] I need you. [crying] I need you, dad. [Thomas' voice] It's not my problem anymore. [mobile phone falls] [thunderstorm] [rain falling] [breaking glass, horn] [deafening horn] [groans] [horn stops] [mobile phone chirps] [knock on the door] [knock on the door] [knocking on the door] [sound of footsteps] Marta. Martha! You are here? Martha? [light bulb explodes] Martha? [woman] Here. [woman] Sit here, love. Mom. Here. Love. I missed you, mom. I missed you too. Do you remember what I always told you? You have colored my life. You are the best child in the world. You were sweet. I live. The most beautiful in the world. Who cooked for me with love. That he had a dream. How did you end up here? How did you get like this? Whose bed is this? I'm sorry but'. [woman] This beard. These eyes. Look how dirty you are. You are different. You are not my son. You are not my husband. Who are you? It's me, ma. It's me. You were the best boy in the world. The most beautiful. The sweetest. You are now a failure. You are the void. My love. [hiss] It was him. He left you alone. And he blamed you. [hiss] But it's all his fault. We were a beautiful family. And he screwed it up. [hiss] You know what king does. You've always known that. No. [groans] Free yourself. As? As? I do not want. Yes you do, my love. Do it for you. For Barbara. It is not too late. [groans] [wakes up] It's my turn. Come on, dad, you're a "pippa ar sugo". - But you and I have to kill each other? - Yes exactly. - You understand everything. - Come on. It's us against the zombies. [shooting from the video game] - Oh God. - Eye. But he reloads the gun, you kill me. And how should I do? - Square. This one. - Oh. Oh mama. You are worse than France in 2006. - But how do you talk? I don't understand you. - Oh yes, Fabio Grosso... - Do you know who he reminds me of? - Who? - Frank. The butcher at home in Rome. - He always tells it. But who is Frank? They called him "the Trilussa della Prenestina". I didn't understand a thing. "A pischelle', give me 'na mezza piotta, 'nnamo." - You always tell everyone then, oh! - Oh well, it's okay. - Stop, let me play. - No because? Ninth. Be good! No, no, no! No come on! [laughs] Give it to me! Where? - Stopped! - First resist this, big-ass! Stopped! You don't tickle me, you just hurt me! - Hello children. - Stopped! - Good evening. - Hi, ma. [Enrico] Run, otherwise you'll die. mmm. [voices, sounds from video game] Tired? mmm. Dead. The client is a marquise, or so she says. Her daughter wants to get married by the sea, while she is obsessed with St. The agency went into a meat grinder and they asked me to hurry up with the bride. -And how did she go? She-She slammed the phone in my face. - Three times. - Gentle. Troy. [Enrico and Gianluca speak indistinctly] But mom is much nicer. They've opened a super restaurant downtown, you know? They are looking for a chef. I told him about you. And why? So. Wasn't I supposed to? I don't understand what I have to do with it. [woman] But nothing, I was talking, so... The topic came up, you do it for a living... [Thomas] I already have a job. And soon I will have two. I KNOW. [mobile phone chirps] [sighs] Oh, we need to go get Barbara. Wasn't she at nine? Yes, but Marinella just texted me. The daughter is throwing up in front of everyone. No, she doesn't exist. I have to close the tender for the agritourism. I have a crazy headache... Expires at midnight. They are non-repayable contributions. [sighs] All right, I'll go. She tows, tows. I'm coming with you, ma. Don't worry, stay with Gianluca. - [Enrico] A lot... - No, I was going. - [Enrico] Do you have everything? - [Gianluca] Yes. Good evening, thank you! [Enrico] I haven't studied shit for tomorrow. - [Gianluca] Why, do I know something? - You have all nine. - [Gianluca] But of what? - Yes, well. Hello, Gianlu'. [speaks in French] T'es vexé? On goes and will come. Pourquoi t'y crois pas? Évidemment que j 'y crois. - Do you want me to drive? - Yes, you would. You could have told him no. It hurts you to smoke. [smiles] Are you serious? [laughs] You get yellow teeth, wrinkles, cough... Ah! Now I understand why you are so ugly. [giggle] A mother more beautiful than me could not happen to you. Yes. You should hear what your friends call me when you're not around. - Why, what do they call you? - Well... In certain ways. - [giggle] - Well, what? What ways? - But nothing. - No, now you tell me what they call you. - Why? - No, tell me! - They call you... - You're little... - Little one? - You better not know. - Grow some more. - Alright. [giggle] Little one... I'll take care of it now. You are just like your father. - [woman] Marinella? - Oh, Christina! Influence. She's been like this since this morning, but imagine if she gave up on the party. - Great way to create an outbreak. - Certain. Always better the outbreak than tantrums all night. - But how are you? You have a face! - A marvel, look. - Can I have some orange soda? - Sure, come. - Excuse me, you made Thomas come! -He is working. Since we took that place outside Viterbo... Ah yes, the agriturismo! What a great idea you had. When I told my husband he freaked out. - [Barbara] Mom? - Treasure. Can I take them home? What are you going to do with all those balloons, Barbie? I attach them to the bed, so when I sleep it feels like I'm flying. - Goddamn Disney. - [giggle] They're from Carlotta. I'll buy you more. But I want these. But how can you resist those big eyes? All right. But not all, who don't even get into the car. [smiles] Not near your sister. - [burst] 'Ah! [Henry] Mom!
