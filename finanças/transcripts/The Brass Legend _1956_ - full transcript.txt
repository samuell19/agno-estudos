(dramatic orchestral music) (gun firing) Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. (mournful harmonica music) (dramatic orchestral music) (soft orchestral music) (gun firing) - How's that, Wade? Hit him every time. - Your marksmanship's not bad, but speed not so good. That's 'cause you're wasting a lot of time slapping leather. You're wearing your gun belt little too high. That's it, lower it a little. You got to have your, your wrist just so it's about touching your gun handle. That's about right. Now watch. You watch his eyes, don't ever watch his hands. (gun firing) - Gosh, I'll never be that fast. - You will if you practice. The more you practice, the faster you get. A 10th of a second can make a lot of difference to you. - Wade, who's the toughest bad man you ever faced? - That's kind of hard to say, you see some fellows that were supposed to be tough, walking crawfish. Others that weren't turned out to be bearcats. I guess it all depends on what you mean by tough. - Him, have you ever seen Tris Hatten? - No, I don't think I'm likely to either. (gun firing) - You know, a wasted shot cost many a fellow his life. Speed's important, but you gotta hit what you're aiming at, too. Now try it again. (gun firing) - That got him. You really think Tris Hatten is dead? - He's supposed to be, according to the legend. Of course, that legend's as phony as a brass gold piece. It's the worst kind of a killer, shoot a man in the back, just as soon as look at him. Kinda hope he is dead. - I'll bet he ain't. (soft acoustic music) - There you are, son. - Gosh, dad. - Now, every boy should have a horse of his own, and lots of room to ride him. What are you gonna name him? - I don't know, Dad. Wade, how come you call your horse John Henry? - Well, I'll tell you Clay, in Texas it was considered good luck to name your horse after the man you bought it from. I got mine from a fellow by the name of John Henry Callahan in El Paso. - Dad, that oughta be good luck in Arizona, too. Daddy, who'd you get the horse from? - A Yaqui horse trader named Sinoye, S-I-N-O-Y-E. - That's what I'll call him, Sinoye. Thanks dad. Thanks for Sinoye. Come on, Sinoye. - Boy was sure surprised, wasn't he? - Yeah, he sure was, what's the occasion, Tom? It's not his birthday. - Oh, no occasional Wade, just feeling good. Been feeling real good ever since you asked Linda to marry you. - Well, the feeling's mutual. - You know, when a man tries to be both father and mother to his kids. Clay, he's all right. He's a good rider. - Pretty handy with a gun too. - Yeah, he can take care of himself. But Linda, well, it's different with a girl. Home of her own, family of her own. That's what'll make her happy. Now there's nothing to worry about. Not anymore. Will you stay for supper, Wade? - I was kind of hoping you'd ask me. - Good. Hurry up son, get cleaned up. (western music) - Sanchez? (speaking in foreign language) - Relax Sanchez. I ain't no ghost. - Si Senor Tris, but I thought, they said that you were. - Yeah, I know. You thought I was dead. You, and a lot of other people around here. - Si Senor. - Well go on. - Si Senor, first I water your horse, no? - No. Passed Millie's street. She still around? - Si Senor, she still works at the Cantina Mescalero. - I want to see her, here. - Here, Senor. - Yeah here, and right away. Sanchez. Now you can water my horse. - Si Senor Tris. And then I will tell the senorita that you are here. Only the senorita. - Clay, aren't you gonna help your sister with the dishes? - Oh that's all right, dad. That new pony of Clay's can't wait to get better acquainted. Not too late now, huh? - I won't go far, see ya. So long Wade. - Clay, you talk to him like he was a man. - Talk to a pony? - Sure. Some night, when the trail's long and the coyotes are howling, give you a lot of pleasure having somebody to talk to. - Sure son. You can confide in your pony. Tell him all your secrets. - I ain't got no secrets, Dad. - I haven't any secrets, Clay. - Me neither. - Boy sure thinks the world of you, Wade. - You've been a fine father to him, Tom. You worried about him meeting up with Apaches, Linda. - I wasn't thinking about that. - What then? - You taught him how to ride, how to shoot. - Boy that does them good has a better chance of becoming a man. - I hope he grows up like you, Wade. - Becomes a sheriff? I wouldn't want that for Clay. - No Linda, I expect Clay will stay right here on the ranch. Same as I hope you and Wade will. - I'll tell you Tom, I was figuring that Linda and me we'd- - Wade, as soon as you and Linda are married, I'd like it a whole lot if you turned in your badge and became a partner in the ranch. - This sounds like men talk. Besides, I have some dishes to do. - The way it stands, this is a two-man spread. And when Clay's at school, it's all I can do to run it. Clay's growing up now. Him, you and me, we could make it a big spread. (soft western music) - Come on, Sinoye, Apaches. Bang bang. I guess we got rid of them, Sinoye. I'll tell you what, this time I'll be an Apache scout, and you'll be my calico pony. The posse's out looking for us. We'll hide here. No noise, now. (dramatic music) There goes the posse, come on, we'll follow them. (soft harmonica music) - Whoa. Tris! (sinister orchestral music) (soft harmonica music) - Sorry, I took so long. What's wrong? - Oh, nothing's wrong. Wade just doesn't want to be a rancher, at least not on this ranch. - That's not what I said. - What did you say, Wade? - Linda, your father made us a very generous offer. I told him I'd be glad to take him up on it, one year from now when my term as sheriff runs out. - Wade, we've been all through this before. You know, my only- - Linda nothing can happen. - How many other peace officers have said the same thing? 10 seconds later. Look Wade, I know you're not afraid for yourself, but how do you think I feel? Every moment you're away from me. Not knowing when some outlaw might put a bullet in your back. Not knowing when some drunk would punch you. Just not knowing. - I know how you feel, Linda. But try to understand, a peace officer with a term definition. I'm not particularly fond of the job. When I was a peace officer in Texas, I even hated it. One day I took stock in myself and I decided that I didn't want to wear a badge anymore. Men just can't be natural with you, not when you're the law. A man buys you a drink, he's buying the badge a drink, not you. I wanted to live like other men not be fed by 'em, so I turned into my badge and hit the trail for California. Arizona is as far as I got. Just about two years ago I pulled in this little town. I liked the people here. The town seemed real quiet and peaceful for a change. And I met you. Didn't take this job because I wanted to wear a badge again, I felt like staying. They needed a Sheriff. It's what I knew how to do, so I took the job. It's only got another year to go and I just don't want to quit again. - Wade, all I'm asking is- - Linda. Honey, it's gonna have to be my way. - You can't compromise, can you? - Not about this. (solemn western music) Good night. Clay? - I saw him, he's here. He's right here in Apache Bend. - Take it easy, Clay. Who's here? - Tris Hatten. - Hatten? You weren't spooked by a barrel cactus were you? - I tell you, I saw him. - You just saw somebody that looked like Tris Hatten. - It was him. Haven't I been shooting his picture all this time? - You go on home and get to bed. Your sister's probably worried about you. - It was him, all right. And he was with Millie Street. - Millie Street? You sure? - Of course, I'm sure. I followed her all the way to Mex Town. - Mex Town? - She met Hatten at Sanchez House. - You hightail it back to the ranch, and get this. Don't you say one word to anybody about what happened, you understand? Nobody must know you had any part in this. Now, you promise. - I promise. - All right, get going, go on. (ominous orchestral music) - And everybody thought you were dead. You could have at least written me, Tris. - Nothing's gonna kill me, you should have known that. Who's the new sheriff in Apache Bend? - I don't know, a guy named Addams. - Never heard of him, where did he come from? - I don't know, Texas I think. - What do the folks around here think of him? - What difference does it make? He's well-liked I guess. Be careful this time Tris. Your picture's all over the place. - Yeah, I know. 5,000 dollars, dead or alive, for the slaying of Sheriff Bates and his deputies. A Sheriff as slow on the draw as old Bates deserved to die. Him and those deputies of his. I did the county a favor by getting rid of them yellow bellies. I should've had you down in Sonora with me. On the other hand, maybe not. You know them, them Yaqui gals was all right. (giggling) (tense music) - Let's do this the easy way, Hatten. You're under arrest. - Why you dirty. - That's enough. You all right, Millie? - Yeah, fine. Here, put those on him. Go on. Turn around. All right, Hatten. Millie first. (ominous orchestral music) All right Millie, get in the buggy. Go on. - You've got gun. He's got handcuffs. Does that make it even in your book, Sheriff? - All right Millie, you know where the jail is. Take the short route. (dramatic orchestral music) - Where the devil have you been? - I've just been riding around. - Well a boy shouldn't roam around the country after dark. - I just rode around the ranch. - I don't care where you rode. You'd look fine without that a head of hair, wouldn't you? For your information, young man, there's still plenty of scalp lifting Apaches running loose in this country. - Sinoye is faster than any calico pony, I can tell you that. - Glad you had sense enough to take your rifle. - Yes, sir. I always do. - Clay? - No harm. - Aren't you hungry? - No, I think I'll go to bed. - Something on his mind. - Maybe he was with Wade. - That's all he cares about. All anybody cares about around here. Wade Addams. - Cooper, take over inside. - RA and Stan will relieve you at midnight. I want a 24-hour watch kept on Hatten. (crowd murmuring) (murmuring stops) - Any strangers show up, you let me know. - You're the scum of Arizona. And I want to tell you, you're not gonna find anyone around here with guts enough to convict Tris Hatten. I'd like to see you with Hatten, when he's armed. He didn't even have his guns on when Addams surprised him. Hatten was handcuffed when Addams gun-whipped him for no reason. You didn't know that did you? Take a look at your fine tin badge hero. Take a good look at that yellow belly. I wish I were a man, for just one hour. I wish I were a man. - I wish you were one too, Millie. - That's all I'd need. Just one hour to get them. - Them? - Yeah, both of them, that tin badge and whoever tipped him. (sinister orchestral music) - Hey Charlie, you really got Tris Hatten in there? Anybody seen him? - Nobody's seen him, but everybody heard how brave the sheriff was, sneaking up and capturing Tris when he didn't even have a gun. - Yeah, and pistol-whipped a man wearing handcuffs. Big man our sheriff. - About time Hatten got a dose of his own medicine. - About time he was hanging from a cottonwood. - The man's entitled to fair trial before he hangs. - Who'd he ever give a fair chance to? Just the same, he'll get his trial. - If he lives long enough. - Which he won't, the way the Sheriff's been handling things. - Yeah, who does Addams think he is? - He's the law here mister, that's who he is. - How is he this morning, Doc? - He'll live to hang. That's all he's born for. (knocking on door) - Who is it? - [Man] Mister Tatum wants in. - Wait a minute. Come on in, Jonathan. - Wade. You really got him. - Tris has quite a headache. - I'm gonna get out an extra on this. I'm gonna telegraph it all over the country. Tell me how it happened, Wade. You took him in single handed? Come on, tell me. I got a tip that Hatten was around, but don't ask me who it was, 'cause I can't tell you. - Well, go on, go on. - Last night, I saw Millie Street out in a buggy and I played a hunch, followed her to Mex Town Sanchez's place. There he was unarmed. - What about that headache? - He tried to make a break for it after I got the cuffs on him, I had to tap him one. That's all there is to it. - What about Sanchez, you gonna hold him? - What for? - Harboring a criminal. - I can't see him telling Tris Hatten to get off his place. - He did the best he could under the circumstances. - And Millie Street, what about her? - I've got nothing on her. - Well I got enough background on you, Wade. I've certainly got enough on him. New York Herald'll pay me enough for this story to keep me in champagne for a year. Oh Wade, you gonna let me out of here? - Right. - Can I buy you a drink, Wade? - Ordinary whiskey? - Yep. - Cooper, you watch Hatten, keep the door locked. Charlie, go on over to Sanchez's place and get Hatten's stuff. - Here he comes. - That tin badge sheriff. If I knew who tipped him about the Tris, I'd gouge his eyes out. - The Mexican. - No, the yellow belly'd be too scared to turn anybody in. - I'd sure like to get my hands on the gent who sicked Addams on Tris. - I'll bet. - Before this is over, there's likely to be an opening for a new sheriff. - You figuring to gun Addams Shorty? - Why not? He's just another man. - If Addams ever came after you, you'd go running from here to Sonora without stopping. - How do you know what I'd do? - Who cares anyway? Come on, I'll buy you a drink. Later. - Hi Doc. Sheriff. Wade, that was nice going last night. - Thanks. But last night you weren't sure whose side you were on, were you? - Wade, I got a business to run. - This on the house? - Sure, sure. It's on the house. Swapper, get going and clean up out front. - Doc, I got to tell you something. I got to tell somebody. - Why me? - I trust you. It was Clay Gipson that tipped me off on Hatten. Followed Millie, saw her meet Hatten. Came hightailing it to me. - Why did the boy follow Millie? - Who knows? Just a kid playing games I guess. - You did right not telling it was him that tipped you off. If you had, his life wouldn't be with the price of a tombstone casket. You know him better than I do. There's men in this town that'd kill the boy, just to get in good with Hatten. - Hello dad. - Looks like a storm brewing. Sinoye's in the corral. Why isn't Clay riding him? - Clay's been in his room all morning. - Look at this. Wade captured Tris Hatten. Linda, have you seen him this morning? Did he say anything? - I haven't seen him. - Not Wade, Clay. - I told you Clay's been in his room all morning. - Oh, I'm sorry Linda. I didn't mean to be so short, but well, this story is, I've been thinking about it. - What's that got to do with Clay? - I don't know. (birds chirping) - All right Hatten, you're covered, now stick up your hands and turn around. Wade, search him and bring me his guns. - Hello son. I thought I heard you talking to somebody. - No dad, there's no one here. Just me. - Nice day for riding Clay. Boys I know, if they had a new pony, they'd be out- - Sinoye is the best pony in the world. I just didn't want to tire him out. That's all, not after last night. - What about last night? - I was out late, remember? - Yeah, I remember. Clay, did you see Wade last night? - Why sure Dad. I saw him here at the house. - No, no, I mean, did you see him after he left here? - Yes. I met him on the road as I was coming home. - I thought you just rode around the ranch? Clay? - Yes, sir. I just rode around. - Did you do any riding with Wade? Clay? You know you and me never had any cause to lie to each other. I don't think we ought to start now. You know about that? - I promised Wade. - I'm proud to hear you say that son. A man's as good as his word. I'm your father, Clay. Father and son, there's nothing closer. Anything you tell me it would be just exactly like telling it to yourself. - Do you think Wade would understand that? - I'm sure he would. - I guess you're the only one in Apache Bend who ain't read it yet, except for him. You're gonna be famous, Wade. - That'll be the day. When a lawman becomes more famous than a killer. Hatten, when your friends read the Blade, they'll come running for Apache Bend. - I can do without friends. - You're lucky. (sad harmonica music) Better lock it. (horse neighing) - [Tatum] You are absolutely sure about this boy? - [tom] Yes he is. - It's all right Clay, I understand. - Eventually a newspaper man gets the real story. - I suppose you want an explanation, huh? - Do you have one? - I'm astonished at you Wade. Well I guess you can explain it, somehow. - Look Tom, don't you realize his life isn't worth the price of a dead cat if the word gets out that he's the one that put me onto Hatten? - Come on Wade, who'd want to harm a 12-year-old boy? - At least a dozen kill crazy gunners right in this town'd shoot him if he was a four year old. - You wouldn't happen to know what the rewards on Hatten add up to? - You figure I'm trying to cut Clay out of the reward money? - Nobody accused you of that, Wade. - 5,000 that the county put up, plus several other amounts from here and there. I reckon it might add up to about 10,000 dollars. - Listen I'm not interested in the money. - What are you interested in? - Saving to boys' life. Now look, Clay can have every cent of that reward, providing you don't print anything about his part in the deal. - Now, I'm not a rich man Wade, but the reward's not important. There's one thing we Gipson's got, and that's pride. - Is that what you call it Tom? - Well I want this town to know the part my boy had bringing Tris Hatten in. - And this town's gonna know it, even if I have to stay up all night to get out an extra addition. - Is that the way you want it? - That's the way I want it. - Clay hardly tasted his supper. Guess he feels pretty bad about the whole thing. - Yeah, like he let the Wade down. - Maybe he did. Maybe we all did. (light western music) - Good morning, Clay. - Morning. - Son, you're gonna be rich. - Daddy sent me down to get a copy of the Blade. - Yes, there you are, help yourself. How do you like the look of that, Clay? - Gee, Mister Tatum. The courage of 12-year-old Clay Gipson led to the apprehension of the dangerous outlaw, Tris Hatten, the night before last. Displaying great daring, the son of rancher Tom Gipson discovered the hideaway of the bad man. How's that for a lead? - It's fine Mister Tatum. Only it was really Wade Addams that captured- - Clay, it's all there, exactly the way it happened with you and Addams. There's more there about the sheriff. Why don't you read it? Go ahead, read it. - If the part played by Clay Gipson in the capture of Tris Hatten was omitted from a previous extra edition of the Blade, the blame must rest with Sheriff Addams, who refused to share the credit. - Go on, there's more. - Sheriff Addams' lame explanation was an unfounded fear that friends of the outlaw might try to harm the gallant boy, however, in uncovering Clay Gipson's part in the taking of Hatten alive, the Blade also discovered that the rewards for the capture of the bad man are considerable. But Wade said he didn't care about the money, Mister Tatum. - Nobody accused him, Clay. Clay, your father may want to save these. (sad harmonica music) - I guess he's hightailing it back home. - Yeah, well I wish he'd stay there until the trial's over, and Hatten's hung. - Yeah, it'll be another week before the territorial judge gets in. - Yeah. (knocking on door) It's me, Cooper. - Paper's on the desk, Wade. - I read it. - Looks like the joke's on the both of us, huh, sheriff? - There's nothing funny about it, Hatten. - You don't think I look like the type who'll go around shooting little kids, do you? - You're the type that'd shoot butterflies if you thought you could hit 'em. - Clay Gipson. You know something? I admire that kid. He's got more guts than a lot of men I've faced. (sad harmonica music) - You know what I'm gonna do, Cooper? I'm gonna turn in my badge, just as soon as Hatten hangs. I was wrong. This town's just like all the others. I'll let the good solid citizens learn what it is to live without the law. Let the gunslingers take over. It'll get so bad they'll have to bring in a killing Marshal, one that's no better than the outlaws themselves. Let them learn the hard way. You want a break? - I just took over from Larry not more than half an hour ago. - Be back soon. Good morning, Linda. - Hello Wade. - I guess your dad told you what happened, huh? - He sent Clay in to pick up the Blade. I just saw him, he was going back to the ranch. - Did you read the paper? It's just about how it happened, except for the part about the reward money. I guess there'll be those who want to believe it. - Wade, people who know you will believe the truth. Just give them a little time, things will work out. - Linda, an awful lot can happen before things work out. - Dad said that you were afraid Clay might be in danger. You don't really think so, do you? - Yes, I do. - Surely nothing could happen to him, he's only a child. - You sound like Jonathan. - I didn't insinuate that you might try and, Wade, you know I never thought for a minute you'd try and keep that money. - I know that, Linda. - Look, I wish you'd talk to your dad and try and make him realize that Clay is in danger and that he ought to stay on the ranch. At least Hatten's tried and strung up. The feeling will die down then. - Well what are we supposed to do? Find a hole and bury him in it? We don't have to hide from anybody. - You sound like your dad. - That's just fine. Maybe I'd better start looking at things his way for a change. - Look Linda, I decided that- - You look, you've gotten where you think more of that badge than you do anything, including me. (saloon piano music) - Did you see this? - That little Gipson devil. Should have been more careful. Why not like that after Tris. - Don't go blaming yourself Millie, it wasn't your fault. - Whose then, yours? - Nobody's. - It just happened, that's all. - You boys are strangers in town. - Never been here before if that's what you mean. - Just passing through? - No, we ain't. Thought we might stick around for the trial. (piano music) - A few punching jobs open. - We don't like nursemaidin' cows, hard on the hands. - Never did like rope burns. - On the hands they're not so bad. But on other parts of the body rope burns can be kind of irritating. - Why sheriff, the way you talk, people might think that there was a reward on us. I understand this is a real tough town. Yeah, real tough. - I understand the little kids around here are so tough they go out and bring in the gunslingers all by themselves. - You boys have till sundown to get out of town. - What if we don't? - You go to jail with Hatten. You stay there long enough for me to do a little checkin', just in case there is a reward on you. Cooper, open up. I went on over to the Mescalero and sized up three drifters that are dressed alike, might just pass the word that Apache Bend isn't gonna be friendly to strangers, till Mister Hatten swings. - You worried about some of the boys busting me out of here, sheriff. - Will, one drink please, I'll pay as soon as I can. - Just who is what? Where would you get the money to buy a drink? You've been mooching around here for months. - Go on Will, buy him a drink. Put it on my cuff. - Thanks, Millie. I'll make it up to you. - You Shorty? What could you do for me? - Hold it Billy, got you're dead to rights. Sinoye, go into Apache Bend, and tell Sheriff Addams I just captured Billy The Kid, single-handed. You and me Sinoye, I bet we could bring law to the west. You and me, Wade, and John Henry. (gun firing) (dramatic orchestral music) (harmonica music) - We might as well go ahead and eat dad, can't wait any longer, the steaks will be cold. - Clay's never late for supper. - I guess he had to repeat his story at every ranch. He'll be here in a minute, come on. (Sinoye whinnying) - That must be him now. (ominous music) Get in the buckboard and follow me along the road. (dramatic orchestral music) - Wade? - Yeah? - Tom Gipson's girl, she's over at Doc Ward's. - Take over inside. - Clay's been shot. - Who did it? - We don't know, we found him lying on the road, unconscious. - All right Linda, let's go. - Go on, I'll bring Sinoye. (dramatic orchestral music) - Did you hear that, Shorty? Clay Gipson's been shot. - Yeah, that's what the lady said. - Tris didn't do it. - He's locked up. But Tris got friends, good friends. - Like you? - Like me. I'm his friend. I'm your friend. There's nothing I wouldn't do for you, Millie, nothing. - You killed him. - What do you think? - You really did it? - It's what you wanted, wasn't it? - He was a little kid, Shorty. - I wish you'd make up your mind. Besides, I drilled him plum center. It's too late to change your mind, now. - Get out of here. - Not till you buy me that drink, Millie. - I wouldn't be seen dead with you. Buy your own drink. (harmonica music) - Clay Gipson's been shot. - That's too bad, yeah too bad. I admired that boy. - Is that all you got to say? - Nope. I wished it'd have been you. - If that boy dies, you ain't gonna live to hang. - Wade? Wade? Those three drifters, the ones in the Mescalero. - What about 'em? - Just came to me while I was home having supper. They're the Barlow Boys. They're wanted in Lincoln County, New Mexico for murder. - I don't care about Lincoln County. I'm pulling them in for gunning Clay. - I'll side you. - Thanks, but don't play unless I need you. - They were Murphy guns in the Lincoln County war. - Why'd you say that? - Well, they won't come peaceful. - They'd better. (ominous orchestral music) (laughing) - Have you heard before? - You gonna lock us up Sheriff? - Depends. - Meaning what? We can leave town if we want to? - You know Tris Hatten? - Never saw him before. - Hatten was a Murphy gun in the Lincoln County wars. So were you. Clay Gipson's just been shot. - We're three to your one, Sheriff. (guns firing) - Odds change fast, Barlow. All right, patch him up and throw him in jail with Hatten. - Should let him bleed to death. Make it an even three. - I've got some questions to ask, I need a live one to answer. I don't want to see a strange face in town come sun up. Shorty, your face is familiar enough. But you used to side with Hatten, too. That's worse than having a strange face. You'd better ride. (dramatic orchestral music) How is he? - Bad. My stupid pride. - The bullet went through his side. Linda, get some more irons, plain old ironing irons, anything. - How bad is it? - If the bullet went through his lung, he'll bleed to death. There's nothing we can do about it. - Hasn't he stopped bleeding? - Externally, yes. He'd be dead by now I think, if he was hemorrhaging in the lung tissue. There's something else that worries me, shock. - Shock? - That's something we learned about in the War Between the States. That's the reason for the blankets and the hot irons. The boy's in a state of shock now, and he may never recover consciousness. - What are his chances? - Wade, I don't know, I just don't know. I'm a plain old country doctor, and about all I've learned in all my years is to say, I don't know, when I don't know. - Tom, I came out as soon as I heard. How is he? - Not good. - I've been checking on those rewards. Well, to get right to the point, there isn't even a hundred dollars on Tris Hatten. It seems like all the rewards were withdrawn when Hatten was reported dead. - A hundred dollars. - You know what he did? He killed two gunman in the Mescalero and wounded another while he was questioning them about Clay's shooting. - He did what? - The way I heard it, ma'am, these three gunslingers, brothers, tried to trap him in a deadfall. - One man, outdrawing three? - Wade did. Their little trick backfired. I'm glad it did. There won't be any strange faces in Apache Bend tonight. - Wade? - Don't worry, honey. He's gonna be all right. - Asleep. Remember how we broke out of jail in Santa Fe? - Yeah, I'll never forget. (sinister orchestral music) Break out in the morning, when Pop takes over. - No, not me. I couldn't get very far with this. Besides, all I did was draw my gun when the sheriff was shootin'. They can't hold me very long. - I'll make it up to you. - Before we across the border, a favor for a favor. - Name it. - Get Addams. He killed my brothers. - You can stake your life on that. - I'm staking yours. - Wade? Wade? - Hey Wade? Wade? (sentimental harmonica music) - Wade. Who shot me? - I don't know, Clay. But don't you worry about it, we'll get him. - Wade? - Come on now, take it easy. - I didn't want to tell. - You did what you thought was right. That's about all a man can do. - He's gonna be all right, won't he, Doc? - Sure, he's going to be all right. All right now, get outta here, all of you. I've got to change Clay's dressing. May have to hurt you a little. - Can Wade stay? - Sure. Sure, he can stay. (sentimental harmonica music) (knocking on door) - Good night. - You mean good morning, don't you? - Hey Pop, how about some food? - Too early. Uly's ain't even open yet. - Too much to ask for a drink of water? - Hand it him, huh? - Now listen close, Pop. Take that key ring off your belt, and do it slow. Now, unlock this door. Do it slow, Pop, do it slow. Stand back. Thanks, Carl. This is easier than last time. - Why'd do I have to tell him I was in on it for? - Don't worry. (sinister orchestral music) Hold your guns by the barrel, your right hand, butt down. Quiet and natural like. Drag 'em. Easy does it. Drop your guns, and your gun belts. Now get in that cell, keep Barlow company. Go on. - You won't get very far. You'll never get away with it, Hatten. - Any more out of you, I'll bust that other wing. (rooster crowing) (birds chirping) (rooster crowing) (knocking) (knocking) (horse whinnying) Millie? (knocking) - Tris. You made it. - Told you nothing could kill me. - This time, take me with you. - I can't Millie, not now. I'll send word where to meet me. Durango, maybe. I've always had a hankering to see some of that silver they got there. - When? - I got some unfinished business to clean up. - Addams. - Yeah, Addams. Tell him I'll wait for him just beyond Gila Bend till noon. Just him alone, no posse. - What if he brings one? - I can see 'em from miles away. I'll be in Sonora before they get started. (horse whinnying) - Your horse is in Hanson's stable. - No use to wake anybody. I'll just take that one. (dog barking) (dog barking) - What the devil? Hatten! (gun firing) - Didn't want to kill you, Tatum. First off I owe you a favor, finding out who it was that tipped him off. Besides, I've always liked the way you wrote about me. Much obliged. (dark orchestral music) (dramatic harmonica music) - All right, what happened? - Long gone, Wade. - Barlow too? - Nah, he's lucky Hatten didn't slug him. - Like he did Pop. - Had a Derringer hidden, got the on the old man. - How is he? - Pop? Hatten beat his head in. - Just before he killed Jonathan Tatum. - Hatten's waiting for you. - You give him that gun? - No more than you did. - Hatten's gonna kill you. - Where is he? - Just beyond Gila Bend. He says he'll wait till noon. - I'll go with you. - Hatten says if you bring a posse he'll light out for Sonora, so don't try any tricks. - Fellas, you heard what the lady said. - You'll never make it. - Get going. I want to see how a tin badge sheriff stacks up against a real man. - I'm a real man. Get out of the way, Millie. (guns firing) (screaming) - Shorty. - You all right. - I told you I'm a man, Millie. There's nothing I wouldn't do for you. Nothing. - Nothing he wouldn't do for you. Does that include shooting Clay Gipson? (saloon piano music) - That's right. Just like Hatten is gonna shoot you. You ain't going up against a guy like poor little Shorty. - Millie, you be out of town by the time I get back. - You ain't coming back! (dire orchestral music) (harmonica music) (high tension orchestral music) (guns firing) (guns firing) - I wing ya? - Yeah, you winged me. (sad harmonica music) You hit bad? - Ain't gonna live to get hung. You call that bad? (dramatic orchestral music) - Wade, I heard. - I'm all right, Linda. Doc Ward fixed me up fine. - Wade, you got him. - We'll talk about it later. How do you feel? (horse whinnying) (horse whinnying) You'll be riding him soon. Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
