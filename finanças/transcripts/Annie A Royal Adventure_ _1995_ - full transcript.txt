[*****] Okay, come and get your copies of the New York Globe, kiddies. Make sure you don't leave out the sports section or the funnies like you did last time. Now, buzz off. Okay, who's waiting to get their papers here? There you go, sir. Off you go. Come on, where's the rest of these kids? I haven't got all day. We gotta sell papers, you know. Here you go, pooch. Go on. So, what's the headline today, Sandy? [SANDY BARKS] World population soars to 2.5 billion. Wow. That's a lot of people, huh, Sandy? Hey, Pete. Hi there, Annie. Ah, real good. Sandy. Extra, extra. World population soars. Read all about it. [BARKING] MISS HANNIGAN: Molly, I need your help! Morning, Annie. Good morning, Molly. I brought you this. Homemade. I rolled the dough myself. Gee, thanks. So, what's the headline today? World population soars to 2.5 billion. Wow. That's what I said. Pretty soon, we'll have to wait in long lines just to get ice cream. Or go to the movies. Or go to the zoo. Wow. Hey, if there's that many people in the world, there must be a family out there who would like to adopt me. I'm sure there is, Molly. [DOOR OPENS] I'd better go. Thanks for the pie. Yeah. See you tomorrow. Sandy... we've got to help her find a family. Finish your paper route already, Hannah? HANNAH: Poor Molly. I can't believe she hasn't found a family. Well, she's real special, that's all, so she needs to find a special family. You know, they say it's harder to be adopted if you're too old. What's too old? Nine. Oh, no. Molly's 8. Poor Molly. If she doesn't find a family, she'll have to live the rest of her life with Miss Hannigan, and never have a mom or a dad, and never have a real Christmas, and never have her own pony or-- Hannah, who has their own pony? Kids in books. Well, Hannah, don't go overboard. We'll help Molly find a home. [BRITISH ACCENT] Look, Murphy. They've stopped. [BRAKES SCREECH] Hannah... [WHISPERS] Look at that. [CRASH] What are you doing? [BRITISH ACCENT] You said, "Look." Just give the man some money, and hurry. Leaping lizards. There's a special today, only 10 cents. I got 10 cents from my paper route. Annie, I don't think your dad wants you to spend it on the fortune teller. Oh, I don't think he'd mind. It'd be good to know the future. I could prepare a little. Come on. Hurry. Hurry! There's a bigger problem. We got to go to the station. What? I hit a policeman, off-duty. He's taking his family on a picnic. Put your dime on the table, young lady. Give me your hand. Hmm, interesting. Uh-huh. Oh, no. Oh, dear. What? Are you planning on taking a trip in the near future? Well, no. Maybe go to the library or something like that. I see a long voyage with troubled water ahead. You must warn your family. They must watch out for sinister characters. Sinister characters? Yes. All around you. I see...weasels and...water. And trouble everywhere you go. Hmm, apart from that, your life looks pretty good. Weasels? Gee, what a future. Does a paw cost another dime? Hi, Mr. Asp. What are you doing? Mr. Warbucks asked me to buy some new suitcases. You're going on a trip. Trip? Leaping lizards. Daddy Warbucks. Annie! I was just looking for you. Better start packing, my dear. We are sailing for London. [TELEPHONE RINGS] A little longer on the sleeve. Daddy Warbucks, we can't go. Can't go? Nonsense. It's going to be your Easter vacation, a perfect time to travel. Yeah? Uh, yes. No. But Daddy, I talked to Madame Charlotte. She read my palm. She told me to beware of sinister characters, troubled waters and weasels. I was there. I heard it, Mr. Warbucks. Did you, Hannah? When I say buy, I mean buy. Well, I will not halt the trip, but I will take some extra precautions. Punjab? Yes, sir. Annie and Hannah here have just informed me that... some sinister characters may be after us. I see... and how do we know this? Madame Charlotte, Punjab. She can read the future. Ah. She even read Sandy's paw. She told him to watch out for a gray cat. [CAT MEOWS] [SANDY BARKING] Ah! Sorry, sir. Well, Madame Charlotte must have some gift. Punjab, be on the alert. I will, sir. And... Daddy? Can Hannah come with us? If her parents don't object. Yay! Yay! And can we take Molly too? You'll have to ask Miss Hannigan about that. Why are we going to London? [*****] So the richest man in the world is gonna be knighted. Well, ain't that something, Rupert? I say, Murphy, I'm trying to get my beauty sleep. [CRACKLING] Oh, if you're going to be like that... Going to be like what? The boss is going to be very happy. So do we have to snatch the little redhead? No. We take a little trip back to London. That's when we nab our man. But I thought Annie was a girl. She is a girl, you ninny. We were just going to snatch her to use her to get to Professor Eli Eon. The famous professor lives with Warbucks, and only he has the key to what we need to complete the boss's plan. This is very, very complicated. Not if you use your head. We meet Warbucks and his party on the ship, make friends with the professor, work our way into his room, and make him give us the information we need. Just in case, we'd better keep an eye on Annie anyway. [SQUEAKING] Will you stop that?! Sorry, Rupert. What if the professor doesn't cooperate? He'll cooperate. He'll cooperate. Aah! [POPS, SPUTTERS] MRS. FOWLER: Young lady, you must learn to be attentive always. Each and every day, I have interesting things to teach you, and as your tutor, it is my responsibility to make sure that you are alert and listen to my words at all times. Annie! Stop that at once! Since you continue to disobey me, you will have extra homework over spring vacation. Mrs. Fowler, Sandy wanted-- No buts. You will read this book on medieval castles and write a detailed report. Do you understand? [SIGHS] Homework? During vacation? I don't think Mrs. Fowler was born with a heart. I wonder what Mr. Fowler looks like. I heard there was no Mr. Fowler, that he died years ago, and that she keeps his body in the cupboard. Oh, my gosh. And she sits him down at the dinner table every night so she'll have some company. That is horrible. And after dinner, they play chess, and she makes his hand move the red pieces to all the wrong squares. Poor Mr. Fowler. I'm just kidding. Annie, one day your imagination is gonna get you into trouble. Go ahead. You knock. No, you knock. I don't wanna knock. Hey, what are we afraid of? She's only... well, Miss Hannigan. [KNOCKS] Well... if it isn't the lucky little rich girl and her friend. Hello, Miss Hannigan. Nice to see you, Miss Hannigan. Oh, is it? And what brings you two girls back here to Miss Hannigan's lovely home? We miss you, Miss Hannigan. We miss all the fun times we had washing the floors and cleaning the toilets. Oh, yes, of course we do. And because of all the wonderful things you had us do, we would like to repay you. Oh, yeah? How about us taking part of your burden off your hands for one whole week? I don't get it. We are willing to take Molly all the way to London, across the ocean, for a week. She'll be out of your hair. You'll have one less little brat to worry about for seven days. So, what do you think of that, Miss Hannigan? You want to know what I think of that? This is what I think of that... Uh-uh! [DOOR SLAMS] She's meaner than I remember. There must be some way we can get Molly to go with us. I want an Easter dinner on every table in all of New York City. Do you hear me? Good. Annie, I'm so glad you're here. I can't get the professor to come out of his room. Why? Isn't he excited about going to London? Well, he's a great scientist, but he's not a great traveler. In fact, our house is the farthest he's ever been from his own home. Eli. It's going to be great. Remember? We're going to the Eonite Plant. We're going to see where your very own creation, Eonite, is made. You're my hero, Professor Eon. I can't wait to see the workers' faces when they meet the man who created Eonite, a product that's better than plastic, better than rayon. A product that's so good, in two years, no household will be without it. And a product that, if placed in the wrong hands, could destroy the world. Leaping lizards! Is that true? Well, no one's going to get their hands on the ingredients. Only the professor knows what they are, and we're not gonna let him out of our sight. Eli, you must come. Oh... All right. [SIGHS] HANNAH: Annie, I'm here. Oh, it's Hannah. I have to help her with some, well... very special luggage. What very special luggage? WARBUCKS: Wait till you see her. She's a beautiful ship, a real queen. WOMAN: No, no, that's mine. Sir. Thank you, that's it. PHOTOGRAPHER: One more, please. PHOTOGRAPHER 2: Smile, please. PHOTOGRAPHER: Just one more, please. [BOTH SCREAM] Are you all right, Annie? Fine... I'm just worried about, um... Hannah's luggage. Oh, no need to worry about that. This is the most efficient ship in the world, the Queen Mary. They handle every piece of luggage as if it were a newborn. Come along, girls. [CROWD CHATTERING] Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me! Excuse me. Excuse me. MAN: This way, please. Oh, my goodness! HOGBOTTOM: Excuse me. Thank you. PHOTOGRAPHER: Ma'am, can we get a shot? Excuse me. Please. Just one, just one. [SHUTTERS CLICK] Beautiful, thank you. PHOTOGRAPHER 2: That's great. Oh, my. What a glorious day for the high seas. PHOTOGRAPHER: That's a good one. [SHUTTER CLICKS] Thank you. Who was that? See what you miss by not traveling? Come on, girls. [CROWD SHOUTING GOODBYES] [HORN BLOWS] Stop! Stop! Stop! Stowaway! Stowaway! Aaah! Stowaway. Stowaway! Don't leave, wait! Aah! Stowaway! Wait! Wait! Isn't that Miss Hannigan? Why, yes, it is. She's coming to see us off. MISS HANNIGAN: Stop that ship! Stowaway. What's that she's saying? I think she's saying... Stowaway! "Stay a while. Stay a while." Aah! Stowaway. Goodbye, Miss Hannigan. Bon voyage. [HORN BLOWS] Open it. Open it. Molly. Oh, it's so good to see you. It's good to see anything. How was it? Sickening. All that rocking back and forth. I wasn't dangling high in the air, was I? No. ANNIE: No. Do you wanna throw up? I think I just need some fresh air. Okay. [GASPS] Get in the trunk! [CLEARS THROAT] Hello. Hello. I've, um, come to tell you that lunch is served. Oh! Wonderful. Lunch, Hannah. Wonderful. Weren't there three of you in here? Three? Um, no, just, um, me and Hannah... and Sandy, of course. [MOLLY COUGHS] What's that? Sandy. What, the dog? Yeah, he's got a little cold. [BARKS] Um, the sea air should help him. See you at lunch. Lunch? I'm starving. I promise we'll bring you back something. You too, Sandy. [BARKS] Now, lock the door. All right. Okay. [PEOPLE CONVERSING INDISTINCTLY] [GASPS] Wow. Daddy Warbucks, where is Professor Eon? He won't leave his room. Says he feels safer there. Scientists are a strange and wonderful breed. Ma'am, a photo. Wait. Lovely. Excuse me, excuse me! HOGBOTTOM: Excuse me. Run along. Excuse me. Ooh! Excuse me! Excuse me. Ladies first. Oh, why, thank you. Wait a minute. I know your face. I know you. You do? You're Oliver Warbucks. Well, indeed I am. Oh, I've been such a great admirer of yours for-- Well, I won't tell you how many years because that would be giving away my age, and we wouldn't want to do that, would we, Mr. Warbucks? Please, call me Oliver. Oliver. A telephone call for you, Mr. Warbucks. Excuse me. Of course. Yes? Yes, by all means. Fit the children of China with the best shoes you can find. Excuse me. May I know your name? Lady Edwina Hogbottom. Lovely meeting you, Lady Hogbottom. Is Lord Hogbottom on the voyage? Ah, je regrette Lord Hogbottom, God rest his soul, is under the voyage. Under? He was lost at sea many, many years ago. Well, your ladyship, would you like to dine at the captain's table with me and my family? Oh, with the richest man in the world? I should be honored, Oliver. This is my daughter, Annie, and her friend, Hannah. Ah, what pretty little girls. Don't you just love children? Don't you just love adults? Ah, Murphy! What are you doing, sneaking around? You told me to sneak around. With me, Murphy. You're supposed to sneak around with me! Not so close. Knock on that door. WARBUCKS: And I'm sure Captain Thomas here has some interesting tales of things left at sea. Oh, I do, Mr. Warbucks. Our lost and found is full of stories. My goodness, me. You girls must be hungry. What? Oh... Oh, this, um... This is for Sandy, my dog. Right, Hannah? It's for Sandy. You see, I don't like to feed him in the dining room because it upsets some people, so I thought I'd just bring his food back to the room. Well, we'll get Sandy his own food. Waiter, would you bring Miss Warbucks a large dinner plate for her dog? Yes, sir. Thank you very much. [FEIGNED CHUCKLE] Oh... children. They're so full of surprises. Do you have children? Uh, well... No. No, not-- Not exactly. No children. A plate for your dog, young lady. [KNOCKS] EON: Who is it? Uh, we're looking for Professor Eon. You've found him. Bingo! We are with the Queen Mary welcoming committee. Yes? And we'd like to talk to you about the onboard activities. Shuffle board, cards... and nightly social dances, where you can meet the eligible ladies onboard. Ladies? Oh, yes! There are many lovely ladies just dying to meet an eligible bachelor like yourself. A bone? We brought you a potato. And a piece of children. I don't know. Being a stowaway is not as romantic as in pirate stories. I promise... we'll bring you back a real big dinner. [BANGING] What's that? EON: Leave me alone. It's Professor Eon. Who are you? I'm Murphy. Well, I'm Annie, and Professor Eon is a friend of mine. And I demand you let me into his room. [CRASH] I can't let you in. EON: Oh! I think I can trick this guy. I don't think he's very bright. I'll find out. Hello. How much is two times 20? Two times 20? That's what I said. Well, it's a lot. It's a very big number. He's a dummy. Good work, Molly. I think I've got him. Excuse me. Could you please turn the light on in my room? It's dark in there and I'm afraid to go in. Yeah, sure. One and one is... two, I'm sure... Sandy, come on. [BARKS] Hannah, go tell Daddy Warbucks that there are sinister characters aboard ship. HANNAH: Sinister characters. [GRUNTING] There are sinister characters on the ship. Sinister characters? If you'll all excuse me. Asp, Punjab, let's go. Professor Eon! Professor Eon! Professor Eon. Are you all right? Mr. Warbucks, Professor Eon's in there. Thank you, Molly. Molly, what are you doing here? Uh... We were gonna surprise you. I'll deal with this later. [TRIES HANDLE] Asp, the door. Yes, sir. [GRUNTING] [MUFFLED VOICE] [GRUNTS] After him! Oh! What happened to you? They asked me to multiply. What? Oh! Come on, this way. Decoy. Decoy. What decoy? Man overboard! WOMAN: Oh, dear! RUPERT: Man overboard! Who? Murphy! [PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY] It's us. It's us! WOMAN: Isn't there a lifeboat? Come on, Murphy. [BOAT HORN BLOWING] Is that them? ANNIE: It must be. No... Oh! Are you all right? Oh, what? Oh, yes. Yes, yes, I'm-- I'm fine. I just hate trouble, and drowning-- Drowning is so upsetting. It's so wet. I'm fine. [SNIFFLES] Will you come on? In here. We can hide in here until we land. Where are we? MURPHY: We got company. And as for you, Molly... Yes, Mr. Warbucks. Being a stowaway is illegal, you know? We'll have to send you back to Miss Hannigan's as soon as we dock. And that... is when I will deal with you two. Is that clear? [SIGHS] [*****] ANNIE: I can't believe we're in London. A city with history around ever corner. What's that? WARBUCKS: That, my dears, is Buckingham Palace. MOLLY: At least I got to see Buckingham Palace. Now, Molly, you know I should send you back to Miss Hannigan's tomorrow. Yes, I know. But I'm not going to. You're not? But you said on the ship that you-- Well, I've been thinking about it, and after all the help Molly provided chasing those sinister characters, I think she deserves a reward. I'll wire Miss Hannigan. Oh, thank you, Daddy Warbucks. MOLLY: Yes, thank you! WARBUCKS: But the next time there is an escapade like this, someone is going to have to be punished. Yes, sir, Mr. Warbucks, no more escapades. [ELEVATOR DINGS] Here you are, sir. The entire sixth floor. Oh, and here are your messages. Thank you. One from Prime Minister Winston Churchill. I, uh, took the call myself, sir. Good man, Winston. Can't play cards to save his life, though. [SANDY BARKS] Come on folks, let's see our rooms. MOLLY: Oh, my gosh! It's so pretty. Wow! [ELEVATOR DINGS] [SNEEZES] Compliments of the management. Oh, hello. Hello. [SNEEZES] You've got a cold? I caught a chill. I got a special treat here for you, girls. It's from the management. They don't do this for just anyone. Only their most special guests. You know... you look very familiar. I do? Uh...have you been to the Savoy before? No. Well, then we've never met. Here! Take a look at your view. [SNEEZES] Well, goodbye. I must be going. Enjoy your snack. Thank you. Take care of that cold. I feel like I've seen him before. [SNEEZES] Mission accomplished, boss. Well, you finally did something right, Rupert. I'm amazed that there wasn't some unforeseen Shakespearean tragedy that would have prevented you from carrying out just a simple task. No, I did it. They're all happily in the land of milk and cookies. Then we must all give three hearty cheers. I just can't seem to get warm. I think I'll need to spend 24 hours in bed. You can lie in bed for the rest of your miserable life after we finish what we have to do. Oh, I just want to be queen. Is that so wrong? But there's already a king and a queen. I know that, you man-with-no-brain, but I am a Hogbottom, and many, many years ago, the king stole the crown from my family, and now I'm going to get it back. Royal blood is surging through my veins, Murphy. Can't you hear it pumping? I am the last Hogbottom capable of righting this terrible wrong, and no one is going to stop me. I belong with a crown on my head, and a scepter in my hand. [SNEEZES] Oh! Gah... All we need now is that stupid substance, Eonite, to complete my most perfect of plans. Oh, it's so close. I can even smell it. [INHALES] In half an hour, they'll all be asleep. Then we can get our hands on the Eonite. Hello, Winston. Oliver Warbucks here. How are you, old man? Willing to lose some money on a game of Hearts? Yes, I'll bring my wallet. Well, see you soon, Winston. Sour. Let's leave the snack for later and go right to Hyde Park. Shouldn't we tell Daddy Warbucks where we're going? Oh, he's taking a nap. We'll be back long before he wakes up. Molly, Sandy, come on, let's go. Come on, Sandy. Thank you. MOLLY: Thank you. Gosh... I just want to lay down for a little while. Aw, just... sleep later, Molly. Look, it's Hyde Park. Look, it's Peter Pan. Yes, J.M. Barrie wrote the story here in London. He based it on real boys, you know. I love Peter Pan and the Lost Boys. They were orphans like me. Oh, I guess she's worn out. Hey, she's sleeping on our wicket. Oh, our friend is just so exhausted, she can't stand up another minute. The park is big. You can play baseball over there. Baseball? What are you talking about? Well, you've got a bat and a ball. But there's something terribly wrong with your bat. Actually, we're here to play cricket. Are you American? Yeah. I'm Annie. Jolly good. I'm Michael. And I'm Hannah. And I'm ready to play ball. Do you want to play? I'm afraid we don't know anything about cricket. Listen. It's easy. There's a batsman on the field, one to each wicket. The bowler bowls the ball, the batsman hits it, and then runs to the crease that the batsman's run from. You got it? You know what? Let's just play ball. I'd like to speak with Mr. Warbucks, please. Hmm? No answer? Thank you. Hey, you're holding the bat wrong. That's how I hold it. But it's wrong. Pitch the ball. [BARKS] Oh... Wow, that was some swing! Oh, great. The game's over now. We could play tag. No, I'm not playing tag. I'm gonna find another cricket game. Coming, Michael? No, I'm gonna stay here a while. Okay, Molly. Up and at 'em. Molly. Molly? Time to get up, Molly. Molly? Molly? Molly? I can't wake her. Well, she's breathing. She's not dead. Let's bring her to my house. Annie, we don't know this boy. We're not supposed to go with strangers. We live near here, and my mom is very good with sick children. Molly's sick. We have no choice. Shh. [SNEEZES] Shh! Weren't the three of them in here? [LAUGHS] Okay, professor... where do you keep your secrets? [MURMURS] [GRUNTS] [GRUNTS SOFTLY] [SNEEZES] Thank you. For what? I knew there were three of them! I think Mr. Warbucks would like to speak with you. BOY: Kick the ball to me! Hey, Michael. Johnny, is Mum home? Yeah. Who's in the carriage? An American girl. Whose carriage is it? I borrowed it from Mrs. Woods, down by the park. BOY: This way. Kick it. Hurry. Kick it! Your brother? Yeah. Mum, I'm home. Mum? Annie, Hannah, I'd like you to meet some more of my brothers. There's more of them? I have one more. He's at work. Your mother must be exhausted. All right, then, whose are these, Ian's or Johnny's? Could you please help us? I think our friend is sick. Now, you're friends of--? They're my friends, Mum. Annie and Hannah. [BARKS] And Sandy. Michael, get some smelling salts. No fever. Her color's good. Your friend's gonna be all right. A cup of tea would probably help. Do you want to call her parents? Molly doesn't have any parents. She's an orphan. Oh, look. The Lost Boys. Molly, are you okay? I don't know. I feel like I just took a very long nap. You did, dear. Henry, look what I found. Hi. I'm Annie. And I'm Hannah. I think I'm Molly. I've never seen so many boys in one place in my life. Where am I? Well, this is Michael. We met him in Hyde Park, and this is his family. [DOOR CLOSES] What's going on here? How'd you get on? Did you get the job? No, they didn't need me. Oh, come, I want to introduce you to some girls. This is Annie and Hannah. This is my husband, Mr. Webb... And this is Molly. She's an orphan. Hello, Molly. Hello. CHURCHILL: Mr. Warbucks. Goodbye, Winston. See you tonight. Thanks for the game. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Sir. Any messages? Yes, sir. CLERK: There you are. Punjab. You made friends. These are not friends, Mr. Warbucks. These are trouble. The ones from the ship. Again? Someone has put Professor Eon and The Asp to sleep, Annie and the girls are missing, and I find these two rummaging around my room. Do you know where my daughter is? No, sir. It's the truth, sir. Hold these men till I return. Right, sir. Punjab, let's find Annie. Look! [STOMPS] Aah! Oh, my foot. Ow. Stop those men! The car is in the garage. We need a cab. Oliver, what a delightful coincidence. Annie's missing. Can we use your car? Missing? Oh, yes. Yes, of course. Yes. Lady Hogbottom? Oh. What do you mean, "Annie's missing"? Are you sure she's not just taking a nap? Punjab, let's go. PUNJAB: Yes, sir. Sandy! [BARKS] Come on. Thanks for the good time. You're very welcome, Molly. Please come back again. Bye, boys. Bye, Molly. See you. [ENGINE STARTS] WARBUCKS: I was sure she'd come here. I don't understand where she could have gone. She must have been exhausted from that trip. Not my Annie. She never tires. Punjab, drive on. MOLLY: And every morning, Miss Hannigan wakes up on the wrong side of the bed, and storms into my room, and shouts, "Molly, get up! "And...uh... I don't know, wash the cat!" That's very funny, Molly. Now, where am I taking you kids? To Daddy Warbucks at the Savoy. Oliver Warbucks? The richest man in the whole world? That's my dad. Now, that's very interesting. Just a short stop, ladies. Michael, why don't you come in with me? All right. You can work on this while I'm gone. Equations. I can barely subtract. It's warm in here. Let's get some air. [GRUNTS] Gosh, it must be stuck. Guess he locked it by mistake. Are we sure they locked the door by mistake? Oh, dear. What do you mean? Why did they have to stop on the way to the hotel? Why didn't they just stop on the way back? And why did they stop at a pub called the Winged Weasel? Weasel? Exactly. Michael and Mr. Webb know that we're with Daddy Warbucks, and they also know that Daddy Warbucks has a lot of money. So you're saying they're trying to kidnap us? No. Not Michael and Mr. Webb. I hope I'm wrong about this, but we can't ignore Madame Charlotte's warning. Remember? She warned us about sinister characters, troubled waters, and weasels. Michael and Mr. Webb... they couldn't be sinister characters. I don't want to wait around to find out. Hold on to your hats, girls. Follow me. Come on. [BARKING] After them. [SCREAMS] WARBUCKS: Annie. Leaping lizards. It's Daddy Warbucks. [BRAKES SCREECH] Annie. What's going on here? Daddy Warbucks, we were about to be kidnapped. By whom? By whom? By you. You were kidnapping my daughter? No, we weren't. We were bringing her back to you. They locked us in their van. Well, that lock's been jammed for months. I've been trying to fix it. Well, then, what about him? Annie, this is our friend, Jimmy Enright. He wanted to give me a job after school. We all followed you so you wouldn't get lost. Whoops. I'm sorry for my daughter's misjudgment. If there's anything I can do to make it up to you... Mr. Webb said they were looking for jobs. Well, why don't you both come out to the Eonite plant tomorrow. I'll find you good and exciting jobs. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Warbucks. I'm really very sorry. Well, that's all right, Annie. We understand. Well, goodbye, all. GIRLS: Bye. ANNIE: Bye. Goodbye. Hello, Annie. Oh, hello. I thought that you and your friends would be resting after that long voyage. Oh, no, we couldn't wait to see the city. WARBUCKS: Annie. After this escapade, I think you need a little quiet time to reflect on that imagination of yours, so this would be a good time to finish your homework. ANNIE: Homework on vacation in London? This does not seem right. "Dungeons and secret passageways." Why do we have to study this anyway? Who puts people in dungeons anymore? Who can afford one? Oh, my gosh. Look at this. Now, this person must've been very, very evil. They had a dungeon with no windows and only one door, and when that door was closed, there was no light. It was pitch black, and if you walked around, you did it at your own risk, because there were traps everywhere. That's horrible. And there were nails on the floor, and knives on the walls, and alligators in a pit, and snakes. Oh, not snakes. I don't even wanna think of snakes. Well, they had them. [KNOCKING] The cocktail party's in half an hour. Girls...how do I look? Handsome, Daddy. Now, while I'm gone, I want you girls to get some rest. Punjab here will guard the door. We need guards? Mm, just a little precaution. And you... try and keep that imagination of yours under control. Yes. Please, Annie. Don't worry. I think I've learned my lesson. I can't go. Well, certainly you can, Eli. Here, let me fix your tie. I wish I could cut a dashing figure like you, Oliver. Who made your pants? Sears and Roebuck. Well...Mr. Roebuck did an excellent job. You look just fine. You'll be the hit of the party. Oh, well, fine. Good. Oh. Aw, isn't he cute? [LAUGHS] [CHAMBER MUSIC PLAYING] Sir Percy, Oliver Warbucks. Nice to see you. WARBUCKS: How do you do? MAN: Good. Nice to see you. Lovely to see you. Beautiful evening. Would you excuse me a moment? Excuse me. Excuse me, gentlemen. George, Oliver Warbucks. How are you? Nice to see you. You too. Yes, thank you. How do you do? Good evening, Oliver. You look extremely handsome tonight. And I was going to say the same thing of you, only substitute the word "lovely." Oh, thank you. And the remarkable Professor Eon. You look dashing. I am such an admirer of your work. Your brain fascinates me. [WHISPERING APOLOGY] WARBUCKS: He doesn't get out much. Who cares? He's a genius. I'm so embarrassed about Michael and Mr. Webb. How could my imagination have gone that crazy? Do you think Michael will still want to play with us again? I'm sure they've forgotten it by now. They seem like such a nice family. Imagine having that many brothers. I can't. Hannah, you're the only one with a brother. What's it like? Noisy. Boys are very loud and very sloppy, and they like to tease you and tickle you until you can't breathe. Even if you cry uncle, they won't stop. When you go to the movies with them, they eat all your popcorn and drink all your soda, and then complain that they're still hungry. Oh, I hope husbands aren't like that. I hear they're worse. I'm glad I don't have a brother. I don't know. It doesn't sound that bad to me. Telephone call for Oliver Warbucks. Yes? Oh, hello. Yes, my advice would be... you reach a lot of people by radio, but television is the future. Yes, you're welcome, sir. See you soon. The president's eyes are everywhere. Oliver, I was just talking to the professor, and he thinks it would be a wonderful idea if he came and stayed in my castle until you were knighted. Well... the professor is capable of his own decisions. Mm. And it would please me greatly if your sweet daughter and her little friends came to stay too. Oh, Lady Hogbottom-- Oliver, you have no idea of the danger that lurks in this city. And your highly recognizable daughter would be much safer in my castle. Well, I suppose you're right. And the dear professor too. So many people could be after him. Cruel, heartless people wanting to turn his good work into evil. Professor? Hmm. Mm. Good. So it's done. Professor, my castle shall be your home, and may it inspire you to do even greater things. [*****] [CAWING] Ooh. Derwood! Charity! I need you now! Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. How did you get so dirty? Charity? Coming, Lady Hogbottom. Ah, Charity, we are expecting company. We are? I'm a people person, Charity. We must prepare the castle. It's a ghastly mess. [METAL CLATTERING] And alert the servants. What servants? Are you saying we have no servants? You fired them all, Lady Hogbottom. You called them all useless twits. Ah, those servants. Is there no one left? Derwood. Where is he? [METAL CLATTERING] [MUTTERING] Derwood? Yes? Yes, yes, yes. Oh, Lady Hogbottom! Tea? No, Derwood, no tea. We must clean this castle. My guests will be arriving any minute. Guests? We're having guests? Here? That's what she says. Well... Where is my son? He's having a sandwich... in the drawing room. A sandwich?! [METAL CLATTERING] Did you hear that? Hear what? Nothing. [SIGHS] [METAL CLATTERING] WARBUCKS: This must be an exciting day for you, professor. You'll finally see the plant built to manufacture your Eonite. Then on to Lady Hogbottom's. WARBUCKS: Ah, there it is. The world that Professor Eli Eon built. It's nice to see you. And I'd like you all to meet Professor Eon. Where is he? Excuse me a moment. Guess who? Hi, Michael. You look very professional. Do I? Well, I'm not in the lab yet, but with a little hard work, I could be there soon. Is Mr. Webb here? He's over there. He's learning to operate a new machine. He's always wanted to work with his hands. Come on. I wanna introduce you to Professor Eon. My guests will be arriving shortly. I'd like to thank all of you for your hard work. It has not gone unnoticed. It will not be rewarded, but it has not gone unnoticed. I have but one request, Rupert. Yes, Mother? You and Murphy stay out of sight until Warbucks and the plumed man leave. Thanks to your stupidity, our American friends know your faces all too well. [SNORING] [CLANG] Derwood! Mm, mm, yes? [CLATTERING] [CLATTERING CONTINUES] Anyone for tea? Ah. Yes. [WHISPERS] Go on. Ah, quantum. A fixed elemental unit of energy. You know this? Yes! The quantum theory states that energy is radiated discontinuously in quanta. That is correct. Do you work here? Yes, I do, Professor Eon. I'm Michael Webb. I'm so pleased to meet you. You know... my father would love to shake your hand. He works here too? Huh! A nice boy. Can he come with us to the castle? Of course he can. Oh, my guests. My honored guests, welcome, all of you, to Hogbottom Castle. Oliver. Oliver, my dear, welcome to my humble home. Edwina, it's magnificent. ANNIE: It sure is big. Annie, my dear, how nice to see you again. [BARKS] Oh, you brought your dog. Yep. He goes everywhere with me. WARBUCKS: Edwina, this is Michael Webb, a smart young lad from the factory. Ah, smart. Good, I like that. I've never seen a castle before. Well, except Buckingham Palace. Buckingham Palace is an eyesore! It's not even a castle. What I mean is, it's in-- In such a terrible state of disrepair that it would be better to blow the whole place up and start afresh. Uh... Where's the professor? Beautiful place, Lady Hogbottom. Professor... I'm so honored that you could grace my home with your presence. And I've prepared a very special room for you so you can do your work undisturbed. Edwina, you are too kind. Oh, one can never be too kind, Oliver. Tea? Oh, thank you, but I must get back. Oh. Dinner with the prime minister? No. The king and queen. [COUGHS] Excuse me. A little irritation I must get rid of. [COUGHS] All right, then. The Asp will come and pick you up before the knighting ceremony. Have a wonderful time. If you need anything, just ask Lady Hogbottom. Be a good boy, professor. Shall we go into the castle? I have some very amusing plans for our day. [CAR ENGINE STARTS] Hannah... I think I just saw-- Yes? Nah, couldn't be. And this is my great-great-grandfather, Lord Henry Hollingsworth Hogbottom. Brilliant soldier, [METAL CLANGING] but unfortunately, the poor man lost his way, and wandered into the enemy camp. Faulty compass, they said. Tragic. Professor, would you allow me to hold the hand of a genius? Oh...Lady Hogbottom. Oh... Eonite is one of the marvels of the 20th century. And I am holding the hand of the man who holds the secret. Hold all you like, Lady Hogbottom. Excuse me. Do you think we could go outside and play? Outside? You want to go outside? Yes. May we be excused? Well, I suppose so. But, do not, I repeat, do not go into the back garden. I have some very special roses there, and I wouldn't want them to be trampled on. Is that understood? Yes, Lady Hogbottom. Annie? No back garden. And I mean it! And now... back to you, my reluctant genius. Oh... ANNIE: I don't know. There's something about Lady Hogbottom I don't trust. HANNAH: Oh, no, not your imagination again. I know, but I just have this feeling. [GRUMBLING INDISTINCTLY] There they are again! Who? I think it's those men from the ship. Let's follow them. Who are you talking about? Sinister characters. We're surrounded by them. RUPERT: Come down... Heads... She's right. It's them. It's blastoff and we're out here. [SANDY BARKS] The launch shall take place tomorrow morning. Launch? Shh. Come on. We gotta find out what they're talking about. Oh, professor, if my husband had only been like you, I would have been a happy woman. Being your husband would make any man happy. Oh, I've always thought that. Did you see that? Oh, must be my imagination. And now back to you, my reluctant genius. [BARKS] ANNIE: Leaping lizards! It's a rocket. This is incredible. It appears to be a stolen missile used to wipe out entire villages. Wow. A real rocket. [BEEPING] MICHAEL: This is set to explode at 0800 hours. Explode? When's that? Pretty soon. What's it doing in her backyard? You children don't listen to instructions very well, do you? I knew I saw you. Well, then we're all one big, happy family, aren't we? Where's the professor? In my laboratory, where he belongs. What are you gonna do with the rocket? I am going to change the face of England as the world knows it, and no one is going to stop me. Grab them! [BARKS] And grab that mutt. Don't you dare hurt Sandy. It's okay, Sandy, just-- Just stay with me. Now... there's a good little girl. Now, if you cooperate, I won't harm you. Charity, take the boy genius to the professor. [CLANGING] And... if you're very, very good, I might even give you a place in my court. Court? Mm. Where are you taking us? We're just going to put you inside our little playroom. In. In. In. In! [BARKS] Have fun. Where did you get this? I saw it on the table, and I got it before Charity could get her hands on it. Oh, my. A dungeon. How can this happen? It's the 20th century. [CRASH, MOLLY SCREAMS] I wanna go back to Miss Hannigan. Now, let's not lose our heads. Oh, don't say that. I've been reading about these dungeons in my homework and there's always a secret way out. Just as long as there's no snakes. I am sure that there are no snakes. [HISSING] [ALL SCREAM] I never thought it would end like this. I thought I'd have a long life, have a lot of children, travel, have a successful career in journalism, become a master chef. Oh, it could have been such a great life. Hannah, calm down! How can I? There's a bunch of poisonous snakes about to eat me! They're in a pit. They can't get out. But we can. We just have to find the secret door. It's no use. Molly has pushed everywhere. There's no door. Well, we'll keep pushing. Homework is never wrong. I don't think. [WOLF HOWLS] So, now, professor, you can see my dilemma. My beautiful rocket is all set to explode, but it has no propulsion, and that's where you come in, professor. What I need is a little tiny bit of Eonite to go in the tank, and then my rocket will destroy Buckingham Palace and everybody in it, and voilà! The Hogbottoms will be returned to the thrown of England, where they belong. I won't do it. Do you have any idea who you are dealing with, professor? Rupert! Aah! Get Annie. All right, Punjab. Let's see if you can levitate four coins this time. That's my last quarter. I must have silence! I won't say another word. [KNOCKING] Early morning magic, Punjab? ASP: Four coins, Mr. Warbucks. Excellent. I'm sorry I disturbed your concentration. No, it's not that. Look at the paper. Now... Now...look at this. It's those scoundrels, and Lady Hogbottom knows them. Oh, my gosh, the article says one of those men is her son. Men, we've been had. I hope we're not too late. [SNAKES HISSING] [WHIMPERS] Pfft! [CREAKING] ANNIE: Leaping lizards. What's that? Good work, Sandy. [KEYS JANGLING] Molly, wake up. Hannah, wake up. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Oh, let's get out of here. Well... Murphy. Where are they? They're not in here. Oh, Mother is not going to be very happy. HOGBOTTOM: Find those brats. The drawbridge is closed. They've got to be heading for the tower. Mother, I-- I don't care if you're frightened of heights! Find them. You're so strict. I'll be back. And you better think over your options, professor. Your time is running out. Imagine being linked for history to the destruction of the royal family. A black mark for eternity. You know, unless a castle is kept up to snuff, chances are, it's so old that parts of it may be crumbling. [GRUNTS] Well, come on. I can't. I can't! I hate it up here. It's got a nice view. [WHISPERS] Up here. Wait! Wait, isn't that the professor? [CRANKING] [DOOR SLAMS] Mother... Mother! Come on. Mother! Mother! Mother, Mother. It's the professor. Murphy, pull me in. Pull me in! Murphy, pull me in. I'm trying. RUPERT: Hoist me up. Murphy! Murphy? Murphy, pull me in. Pull me in! Mother, it's the professor-- Murphy, pull me in. Don't let go of me. I've got you. I'm slipping. No, you're not. Oh! Murphy, pull me in. Pull me in. I've almost got you in, Rupert. Hoist me up! I'm trying. The rocks, Murphy. The rocks! Where, Rupert? Hey! Murphy! Oh, dear. [GASPS] Rupert! Oh, for goodness sake, Rupert, this is no time for a morning swim. You can't escape this way. Michael, come on. [PANTING] Oh, Rupert, are you all right? Charity. You care. Always. Come on. Let's get out of here. You're right. I'm sick of being Mother's pawn. I've been locked in a freezer, I've been manhandled by a large Indian, I've almost eaten a dead rat, and my mother wants to be queen. It's time to move on. What will we do for money? [METAL CLATTERING] Let's go. [*****] MICHAEL: Professor, would it be possible to change the trajectories to make the missile explode over the ocean? Yes, but we need time. Where is it aiming now? Buckingham Palace. Leaping lizards! MOLLY: She is so evil. Aah! Not evil, darling. Determined. Let her go! All right, professor, go with the boy genius, and if that missile isn't launched within the hour, this little girl is going to have a very nasty accident. Come on. WARBUCKS: Let's walk from here. [ENGINE STOPS] I don't want to draw attention to our arrival, but let us walk quickly. So where's the boy genius? MICHAEL: Lift him up. Twenty and 20... is 40... EON: Pull. Come on. [ALL GRUNTING] We've got to get back to that rocket. Michael, here are the calculated trajectories towards the ocean. Good luck. You and Hannah stay here so Lady Hogbottom will see you in the window. Sandy. You've got a very nasty employer. Uh... Oh! [METAL CLATTERING] Unhand me, you man with a plume! First, you will tell us just where you were going, Mr. Hogbottom. If you must know, I was running away from home. Just a little souvenir. All right, enough games. What's going on here that we should know about, Rupert? My mother... wants to be queen. Queen? What is taking so long? Launch that rocket! Whoops. How dare you try and spoil my plan. Right. You leave me no other course, professor. And so we built the rocket, and it's set to go off this morning. Enough. I have heard enough. Punjab, the jewel. Yes, sir. [*****] Asp, tie them up and call Scotland Yard. Yes, sir. We've got to save Annie and England. Hurry, Annie. We don't get this thing launched over the ocean, we'll all be blown to smithereens. ANNIE: Leaping lizards. MOLLY: Annie, help me! That's Molly. Go rescue her. But-- I can do this. Smithereens... Oh, boy. [SCREAMS] Come on, little girl. Come on. I won't hurt you. Come on. Come on-- You'd better move away, I mean it. Otherwise, you'll both be very... very sorry. Michael. [BANG] My rocket! Oh! I must tell you, most of England's not like this. No! Agh... Oh! Oh, professor, oh, you wouldn't harm poor little me, would you? WARBUCKS: Annie, are you all right? Oh, I'm fine, Daddy Warbucks. Unhand me, you stupid genius. Oh! You know what you've just done, don't you? You've just blown up Buckingham Palace! EON: No, Lady Hogbottom, your rocket is harmlessly exploding over the ocean. No! Professor, darling, perhaps we could discuss this little sequence of events over dinner? Save it for Scotland Yard. [EXPLOSION] Leaping lizards. [RINGS] OFFICER: All right. This way, mum. Watch the stairs. [METAL CLATTERING] You ruined it. All of you. You ruined my destiny. I would have been a great queen. Oh... I think that was a bit unrealistic. Wow, what a vacation. Mr. Warbucks, the knighting. The what? Oh! The knighting! Tea, anyone? All rise for the king. [TRUMPETS PLAY FANFARE] Hear ye... hear ye. By order of the king and the most excellent order of the British Empire, I hereby decree that Oliver Warbucks shall stand forward. [CROWD MURMURING] [DOOR OPENS] Hi. I'm Annie. This is Daddy Warbucks, my daddy. We're so sorry we're late. You would not believe what happened Lady Hogbottom-- I don't know if you know her, but she is evil. Well, she had this rocket in her backyard, and dead rats and snakes-- Leaping lizards. You're the king. Daddy Warbucks? [LAUGHTER] I'm so proud of you, Daddy Warbucks. * The sun'll come out Tomorrow * * Bet your bottom dollar That tomorrow * * There'll be sun * Just thinking about Tomorrow * * Clears away the cobwebs And the sorrow * * Till there's none * When I'm stuck with a day That's gray and lonely * * I just stick out my chin * And grin and say * Oh, the sun'll come out Tomorrow * * Oh, I got to hang on Till tomorrow * * Come what may * Tomorrow, tomorrow * I love you, tomorrow * You're only a day away * The sun'll come out Tomorrow * * Bet your bottom dollar That tomorrow * * There'll be sun * Oh, the sun'll come out Tomorrow * * So you've got to hang on Till tomorrow * * Come what may * Tomorrow, tomorrow * I love you, tomorrow * You're only a day away ** Wait till I show Mrs. Fowler my homework. She's not gonna believe it. My parents aren't gonna believe that I was trapped in a dungeon. [LAUGHS] I don't think Miss Hannigan will even want to hear about my trip. Oh, but I'm sure all the other girls will. They'll be real envious of you. [KNOCKING] There are a few people here to see you, Molly. Who? Mr. and Mrs. Webb? What are you doing here? How would you like to call us Mum and Dad? Oh, I knew you'd find parents. And we're gonna move to the States. Michael showed me how to change an unimportant element in Eonite, making it virtually impossible to use for evil purposes. Mr. Warbucks invited the whole family to America so Michael can study with me. Wow. Instant brothers. You know what I really like, Daddy Warbucks? Happy endings. So do I. [BOTH LAUGH] [*****]
