(humming of traffic) (lighter flicking) - This is the longest that I've been away from Memphis, since I moved there. - Really? - Yeah, and it's the first time that I don't want to go home. I think that you would like it in Memphis. - Yeah? - Yeah, I do. I think that we would have a good time in Tennessee. - What about your house? - What are you asking me right now? - Well when you left, there was someone else living there. - She promised me that all of her things would be out by today, before I got back. So you'd be in the clear. That would be an ex-girlfriend-free house. (horns honking) (birds tweeting) - Is that it? - [Lynn] Yeah. (engine accelerating) (birds tweeting) (Jake clapping) - Jim, let's go. (clapping) Jim, (clapping) Jim, come on buddy. Come on, pal, come on Jim, let's go, buddy. Good boy. (footsteps crunching on gravel) Come on, come on Jim. (can exploding) ("Sweet Thang" by Jack-O and The Tennessee Tearjerkers) - You ever been drunk? - Do I want to have my eye right on the sight? - No, two, three inches off. (rifle banging) - Whoo! - Great shot. (friends chattering) (dogs barking) - Cut the shit! - So I personally, yeah, I don't know what to expect now. - Because it was supposed to be a one man, one-on-one and now... - She booked the ticket, literally three days after I got back from New York, she booked the ticket. And then a week ago, she's saying that Rose is coming, it was great and we're friends and I really like her and that's awesome, but originally Lucy was going to come down and we were going to spend the weekend together. It definitely feels different to me knowing that it's going to be like a larger group. (bottle top clattering) I don't know how Lucy's going to feel about being in this house, I mean, hopefully, I mean, she knows the deal, but I don't know how she's going to feel when she gets here. - How much of the deal does she know? - I don't know either, like, it's usually like, not enough or more than she should know. So probably ask her, but I don't imagine you will. (dogs barking) (plane engines roaring) (travelers chattering) - Ooh, look at you. - Hi. You all right? - Let's go. Help you? - Um sure, thanks. - Cheers. - Cheers, guys. - In the eyes. (glasses clinking) Thank you. (laughing) - I cannot believe I can smoke in here. Light her up. - Somebody took my blood pressure a couple of months ago and it was not good, not good. - Really? - [Jake] Yeah. - Are you growing up? - [Jake] What? - Are you growing up? - Yeah. - I don't plan on doing that anytime soon. - Yeah. - No thank you. - No, thanks, no growing up. - Yeah. I told them too, it was like, it's going to be high and they're like, no, it's not going to be high, you're young, it's going to be fine. I was like, it's going to be high. They took it, that is high and I said, fuck. - [Rose] What do you have to do now? Why is it high? - I don't know really. (laughing) I, let's see... - [Kentucker] Your lifestyle? - It's, obviously it's my lifestyle. I have to make lifestyle changes in order to lower my blood pressure. - [Rose] Oh, that's the one thing I can't do. So what do you do? - There's been a various, variyus, various ways. - [Rose] Variyus? - [Jake] Uh, Kentucker makes movies. - [Rose] Okay. - What do you do? - I'm an actress, I also write for a blog. - [Jake] Tell me what kind of blog? - [Rose] It's a film blog. - Okay. What do you do? - I'm an actress, also. (Kentucker laughing) - [Rose] What's so funny? - [Kentucker] What have I seen you in? - Interesting, good question. - [Jake] That's not a nice question, that's not a nice question to ask, try a different one. - Where have I seen your movies? (Rose laughing) - [Kentucker] I don't have a blog. (laughing) We're all getting there, we'll get there. - [Jake] Yeah. (door clicking) - Okay, so yeah, make yourselves at home. Once again, this is Jim, hey buddy. - Hi, doggy. - Come here. - Hi, gorgeous. - [Jake] Well, say hello to everybody. - We don't even know each other yet, come on. (rock music playing) - Sleep on the air mattress and I'll sleep on the couch, I don't care, I don't care. - Hey, Rose? - [Rose] Yeah? - As far as sleeping goes, you have this couch it might be short, but a mate of mine's sending a mattress. - Great. - So that's what we're doing, so that's fine. - Well, I'll sleep on, if you want the air mattress, I'll sleep on the couch, it's no problem. - [Rose] Okay. - [Lucy] Okay. - Okay. Hi, what about you? - He stays with me. - Well, they have these rooms where you get sucked up and then spin, and spin, and spin, and then nothing. But consistently, like over, and over, and over, and over. - Here you go. - [Lynn] Thank you. - Coming to meet Jake? - No, no. - [Man] No? Oh, he was here earlier. Oh, I thought you were... - Did he just leave or is he... - Yeah, it looks like he was with Kentucker and two other people from New York, some girls, thought you knew? - Who is it? - [Man] I don't know, anyway, what's been going on? - [Girl] Not much. - [Man] Are you doing anything this weekend? - [Girl] No, what's going on? - [Man] My band's playing down the street, a block from here. (toothbrush rasping) (Lucy spitting) - Hey, Lucy. - [Lucy] Uh-huh? - You don't have to sleep on the air mattress if you don't want to, it's not a big deal if you sleep in my room. - Okay. - Okay. (water gushing) - [Jake] It's really nice you're here. - Hm. Yeah, it'll be better when I feel not so tired. - [Jake] I know. (pipe thumping) (door thumping) I'm going to get a ride back from Kentucker's, so don't worry about picking me up, just go wherever, I'll see you guys later. - [Rose] Okay. - Okay. - All right baby, there's a new sheriff in town. (giggling) (door thumping) - I mean... - I guess, I don't know. - It's so, whatever. - The thing that I think that sucks about it, are people are sort of always telling me to do that, to just write something for myself, to be like a vehicle, but... - [Lucy] But who's going to make it? - But I'm not a screenwriter, or I'm not a playwright, or you know, and it's like, - You want to be in it? - I would just judge it the whole time. - That's what I'm talking about, right here. - Yeah, it's really beautiful. - These combo, aces. - Uh-huh. Maybe we try some things on? Maybe I keep these. ("Make Your Mind Up" by Jack-O) - [Jake] Ah, that's a good question, I think we should talk about a salad. Oh, here we go, ready. - [Rose] Whoo, hoo! - Now the whole grill's on fire, but that's temporary. I have zucchini and I have local squash... - [Lucy] Oh, local! - [Jake] And I have asparagus. - That's important. - [Jake] Where did you go to camp? - [Lucy] Cross Valley. - You went to Cross Valley? - Sure did, like 10 years. - I went there for like two weeks when I was nine. - And that was enough? - I didn't like it at all, and then I went to another camp. - I went there for two weeks when I was nine, too, and never wanted to stop going. - That's really nice you had such a good time, I never had such a good time. - Oh, here's what, we got like a million fireworks. - You did? - [Jake] Did you guys drive over the state line and buy fireworks? - I don't know, yes. - (firework fizzing) - Oh! - Whoa! Oh! - Whoa! - Oh my God! Fuck, oh gee, oh! - I mean, I think you have to have a license. You can buy them, I know that. - Who has, how do you get a license? - You go to fireworks school, which sounds amazing. - What does that involve? - Um.. - We got to go. - I don't know, I can't, we should probably apply. I'll write the essay. - Can we, what should I do? - You should send in a video. - How, how soon, can we get this application in? - I'm ready, I'm going to quit my job, I'm not kidding about my job. - You know, I've always hated fireworks. - [Jake] All right, let's go. - Does that match up? (Rose laughing) Say something? - You're funny. - No, I'm not. - Yeah. - Where did our friends go? - It's hot over there. (Lucy screaming) - Stop screaming, okay? (firework hissing) Oh, my God! (firework banging) - It popped. - That was much better than the last one? - Who is this now? - Do you know who's playing? - No it's probably... (drums beating loudly) - What's it called? - I'm not really feeling so party time. - I'm sorry to hear that. - Yeah. - What do you want to do? - I don't know, I don't want to be here. - I can see that. It's not so bad, come on. - I guess you like this music? - That's a trick question. - And this kid, we play on the playground sometimes, he doesn't know how to swing. - Would you just excuse me for a second, I'm so sorry. - Oh, that's fine. - It's really nice to meet you though. - You too, nice to meet you. - Good to meet you. - Good luck with your job... - Thank you. - And good luck finding one. - Thank you. (loud drumming music) - Don't you think that it would probably be easier if you talked to him instead of avoiding him all weekend? Just explain it to him, he's a big boy. - Oh my God, just because you want to go and fuck around with Kentucker or whatever, don't turn it into like you're doing something... - Where do you get off? - Like a favor for me, okay? I'll talk to him like when I need to talk to him. So if you want to do something, don't... - Fine, don't need to be descriptive here... - manipulate it into that, because that's not what's happening. (door squeaking) (light switch clicking) - Hey, Jim. (door squeaking) - You really don't have to stay. I'm fine. - I know you're fine, but I'm not... - You can go and do your thing. - Why would I go back to the party? - I don't know. - When I can see them all the time. - Okay. - Okay? (Lucy groaning) What's the matter? - I'm sick, feeling... (loud drumming) (punk rock music playing) - What is going on? Huh? Hey, it's me. What is this? (door clicking open) - Thank you. (footsteps clattering) Nice place. - What this old shack? - (laughing) This old place. - Um... I don't know, I feel weird. - About me? - About being here, I guess. - You don't want to be here? - I didn't say that. - It looks like it. - I don't know, it feels different. - I'm not trying to give you a hard time, I just want to know what's happening. - I know. - Why does it feel different? Do you feel differently towards me? I'm just trying to understand. - Okay, I feel weird. - Okay. - I'm sorry. I wish that I didn't, but I kind of do. I don't know, like, maybe do you have a drink or something? - Huh? - Do you have anything to drink? - Yeah. - That would be good. - Milk? - No. - SunnyD? - My God, Kentucker! - I guess just because I've been seeing people. So it feels different now. - But that's okay. I mean, I guess if it feels different, it's not okay. But I mean, certainly, you should see whoever you want to see. That doesn't change anything for me. - I guess it does for me, a little. - That's too bad. What are you saying to me right now? - I'm saying what I just told you, I don't know, I'm telling you that I've been... seeing someone. (liquid gurgling) - I think you should have more. - Which is more? Tell me something about yourself. - I grew up in Switzerland. - You didn't? - I did. I grew up in Switzerland. Tell me something about, tell me something about you. You're a film director? - You expect me to fall for that? - [Rose] That trap? - Looks good. - [Rose] Okay. Directors like it, like this? Like this? - I can't remember. - (laughing) I guess I may never leave. I'm having a really good time. - Please don't. - That was sweet. I want to get rid of the face. I hate it. - You look like a little ragdoll in there. - (laughing) I feel like a sarcophagus. - At home here, the average height of an average man? - What's that? - Five, nine and a half. - Oh. What's the average height of an average woman? - About five, s, I don't know, what are you? - Five, four. - You're tiny. - Shoot, oh my God, don't get tall. Tell me something else. - Another thing? - Another thing. - I think when I was a young man, we moved to a different house and we went to a different neighborhood and we were picking out a new house and the neighborhood wasn't built yet. So there was a pile of rocks on the side of the road and me, and my dad, and my sisters were driving around, looking at what house we wanted, but we didn't care about the houses, we just wanted to drive over the pile of rocks. So we told, we made our dad drive over the pile of rocks. But we got stuck. (Rose laughing) We said, "Daddy, go over to the rocks. Daddy, daddy, go over the rocks." It was a big pile of rocks, he went, he, he has, he had a Camry, he had a Camry his whole life. And Camry's didn't, didn't do well with a pile of rocks. We had it towed, had to get it towed away. - Did you say, did he pass on? - Yeah. - When? - Last year. - Oh, wow. - Yeah. It was about, like literally about a year ago. - Do you need help or anything? - I got it, I think. Did you sleep all right? - I slept okay. - Uh-huh. - I slept okay, better than last night. - Good, it's a start. (phone ringing) That can wait. (footsteps clunking) (dogs barking) - It's not a big deal. - That's your ex-girlfriend's mom's house? - Yeah, she doesn't live there. - Your ex-girlfriend? - Yeah. - Isn't that weird? - No. (keys jangling) See, we're sitting out in front of the house right now. - Yeah, after you like shuttled me out without like standing next to me. - Yeah? Do you think that I should have been holding you? - (sighing) No, let's go. - Let's stay, I want to show you to the world. - Okay. - All right? - No, it's not, it's fine. Let's get out of here. (car beeping) (engine accelerating) (door squeaking) (door thumping) (footsteps echoing) - [Jake] How'd it go? - What, great? - [Jake] What, great, good answer. (chuckling) - Hi. - Hi. - Okay? - I'm sorry! - It's over. - It's over. Oh, that sucks. - I was just so grumpy that you had left us. - Okay, I won't, I won't ever leave your side. - Perfect. (vegetables sizzling) - It's our first time ever in Memphis. - Ever, ever. - First time in Memphis, where are you from? - New York. - New York. - [Man] New York, really? - Brooklyn. - [Man] New York State, Brooklyn? - Uh-huh. - [Man] I've never been to Brooklyn. - You should come by sometime, we'll repay the favor. - [Man] All right, that'd be cool. So what brings you to Memphis? I mean just the music, the history, you guys, you know? - Our friend, Jake. - Yeah. - And our friendship. (giggling) - Uh-huh? - And our, just need for good times. - We're just, you know, adventure gals, on a little adventure. - I think you're going to like Memphis. And I bought this '55 Caddy to make it my tour vehicle, dropped a new engine in it and I was supposed to be doing Route 66, Arizona and New Mexico, out there. And I thought, well, new Orleans, Memphis, Chicago. And the way the music migrated up through the south to Chicago becomes electric, goes over to England, the Birds and the, the Yardbirds, and the, you know, the Beatles and the Stones, pick it up, send it back. Well, anyway, I wanted to follow that story and I came to Memphis to do my research in my '55 Caddy. - Okay, so we basically have until, basically we have to get this done on Monday night, because Pete starts a mixed gig on Wednesday. So let's just see if we can get these as tight as we can before then. - Okay, so we have like eight songs. I want to do, Carpentry Mystery Novels and I want to do, 200 Pounds. (gentle electric guitar strumming) ♪ I would be your slave ♪ ♪ If you could just convince me to change my life ♪ ♪ Grateful for just one solemn reason ♪ ♪ To leave my life ♪ (rhythmic drumming starts) ♪ When I see you ♪ ♪ Baby I don't need it ♪ ♪ You ain't around ♪ ♪ I don't think about it ♪ ♪ Everything you tell me is a lie ♪ ♪ And I believe it ♪ - Do you think you'll end up with an actor? - I feel like unavoidable. - I don't see how I could not. - See, that's why I want to believe that you don't have to a little fall in love with someone you're playing opposite because... - I know. - Like, as a little girl, I feel like I always got really scared of that. Like I would, what would I do if my husband had to kiss someone on screen and I had to watch or something. - You were little, fantasizing about being grown up and married to an actor who was having to make out with other people? That's so intense. - I really thought that, I really thought about that. - When I was little, I wanted to be a school-bus driver. - (laughing) I also wanted to be a wedding coordinator. - Oh, God! - Wait, that's in church? Amazing. - Yeah, I want to go there. - I have a crush on it here. - I have a crush on it here too. - You guys want to go to church? - Yes. - Yeah. - So the church that we can go to, I've never been there before, but there was a label in Memphis called, "Designer," in the '70s, and they put out like really, like rocking, funky gospel records. And the guy who is the choir director at this place, had like a couple of singles on Designer that I have that are really good. But I don't know if it's going to be like old style music or anything like that, I'm pretty sure it's like a little more new. But like, it's that dude... - But there's music? - Yeah, oh yeah, I mean, it's a music church, it's a singing and dancing church. You'll get the whole experience, you get the Saturday night, Sunday morning. It's the whole ethnic experience, right there. - Okay. - You fuck up on Saturday and then repent on Sunday. - So we hear that it's Elvis week. - [Kentucker] Yeah. - So probably we should go to it. - To Graceland? - [Lucy] Uh-huh. - Okay. - [Rose] There's just one thing... - What's that? - That I really want to see. - Yeah? - [Rose] That's this vigil. - All right, I know about the candlelight... - You light the candles, one at a time. - It sounds so beautiful. - One at a time. You go, single file. - [Jake] Yeah, you're going to tell me about it? - Yeah, well, have you ever been to it? - [Jake] Nope. - So? - I really don't want to go to that. - Bullshit, no, we have to go! You have to take us, why don't you want to take us? It's going to be so pretty and magic. It's everybody with candles, going one at a time. - Oh, God, your enthusiasm is unbelievable! - [Lucy] It only happens once a year! And it just happens to be while we're here. - Wow, you really have a passion for this. - [Lucy] Well, I just didn't, I couldn't, I can't believe that you don't want to go. - [Jake] You can't? - [Lucy] No. - [Jake] Believe it. (laughing) - [Rose] Nice work. - [Lucy] We want to go so bad. Like so bad, why would we not go? What are we going to do instead? (crowd chattering) (Elvis music playing) - I think like Elvis had this capacity to make everybody that was watching him felt like they, that they were the most important person in the world to him. And apparently like people that knew him really felt that that's what he did for them. You know, that no matter who you were, if you were in the room with him, he made you just feel like the most special person. And I think that like, that's, I think that's part of why he was successful. - I like when you talk about music. It's hot. (wind chimes jangling) - Cool. - I know, but they just did a huge reissue of that, that's supposed to, never mind. (laughing) - I told you, I like when you talk about music. - I know, that's really sweet of you to say. - That's the truth. That is cool. - This is really cool. Because this is like some serious like 1960s fan shit. - Yeah, that's rad. - Not so good stuff here too. - No, it's not so good. - Cynic. - Me? - Yeah. - Listen, just reiterating what you just said. - That's true. (upbeat jazz music) - [Kentucker] This palm seems to suggest an incredibly warm, soul heart, that could not intersect with a part so frigid... - [Rose] As yours? - [Kentucker] No, are you reading the palm? - No, I'm reading the face. - Okay. - I'm a face reader. - Nothing's in there, that doesn't say anything about you. - You're a fraud. I hope you don't make your money this way, because you are a disaster. I like you, all right. - I like you, all right. You probably like me less than already I probably like you. - I would be way more comfortable if I liked you less than you liked me. Is that too much? - Well, I know you would, that's how everybody feels. (DJ chatting over mic) (Elvis music blaring) (stairs creaking) - Literally we do not have enough time. One minute oats all right? - One minute oats? - For you, I mean? - Uh-huh. (water gushing) You have a big head. - What? - You have a big head. We'll still be on time. I don't like it. - Do you want this, I get to take yours? - If you want. - You're not going to eat it? - Well... - Why won't you take it? - I don't know. (laughing) - Do you want some more honey or something, is that it? - Maybe that's the problem. - You on the deed. - I hate it. - I eat what you don't eat. - Okay. (bag rustling) - You hate this? - I hate it. - This is what food tastes like. - What do you like? - These are all right. - That's right if you like candy. (slurping) - Do you have church clothes? - Uh-huh. - That's cute. - I know, I have a yellow dress. - That's nice. - Yeah. - I don't know if what I have constitutes as church clothes. I don't want to get up. But I want to go to church, I have to go to church. Do you have to go to church? - Morning. - Morning. - Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither has an incident to the heart of man the what? - [Congregation] Believe it. - Y'all didn't read it, I don't care how good it was, I don't care how good the music was. I don't care how good he sounded when he lied to you telling you about, he loved you and you're the only one he ever going to be with for the rest of his life. I don't care what you heard. You ain't heard the best yet. (congregation replying) You know why? Because the best is... - [Congregation] Yet to come. - Yet to come. You got, baby, you got to live your life like it ain't over. - [Congregation] Yes! - You got to live your life like there's something better right around the corner. You got to live your life on this word right here. I have not seen nor ear heard, neither has it entered into the... - [Congregation] Heart! - You haven't even dreamed the dream that's as good as what God is going to do. God created women, you're not the weaker vessel in that sense. (congregation responding) Your man has got to be just as strong or stronger than any man. (congregation responding) Y'all not know him? If you do your thing, right, if you prepare yourself, get your education, you can still be a dainty little wife and be a monster in the boardroom. (congregation cheering) Oh, y'all liked that? Do you believe the Bible is true, all right? The Bible says, praise the Lord with what? I didn't hear what you said. It says, praise the Lord with what? (congregation shouting) Now we're getting ready to play some dance music. The choir is going to sing some dance music. And if you believe the Bible is true, what are you going to do? (congregation responding) I didn't hear what you said. Put your hands on it, put your hands on it. Got to get you in the mood. Got to get you in the mood to move. Got to get you in the mood to find your groove. Then you can dance. Come on, y'all. (congregation clapping merrily) Eyes and hands. (pastor singing with congregation) (helicopter buzzing overhead) - I think you rank number one in the country. - For smart? - And beautiful. - I don't know when you're serious or not. But I'm reacting like you're serious. - I'm so serious. I never want you to leave me. If you ever left me, you know what I'd do? - What? - You don't want to know. - You're acting stupid, come here. All right. Sit, sit, sit, good boy. Sit, sit. (helicopter buzzing overhead) - And so, I heard a little rumor. - Those go round. - Were you going to tell me you were going to come up to New York? - Is it so important to have somebody around all the time? That's what you want? - All the time, like you don't live there. It's not, I'm no, I don't want a long distance relationship, absolutely not. - Whoa, I'm not even talking... I don't know, I mean, what are you looking for, you know? I just didn't even know that's what you wanted. You want somebody that lives in New York, that's going to be your boyfriend and sleep over five nights a week. - No. - I mean, I don't understand, because if that's what you want, it's not what I would have imagined. - Okay, well, - But yeah but... - you live in Memphis and I live in New York. - I know. - And you're coming there. - Yeah. And... it would give me extreme pleasure, joy, happiness, to be able to see you out there. - You sound really joyful. - I, yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Why didn't you tell me? - I haven't told you yet. - Well, that's your business. I don't care what you do in New York. - I'll be, look... - If you really feel that way fine, but I wouldn't feel that way if I was in your position. - No, I don't. It's not that I don't care, it's just that I feel like... It would be, first of all, be unfair of me to ask for you to ever be monogamous with me on any level and I never have, and I don't intend to. I understand you not wanting to put up with my lifestyle, that's fine. But it makes me sad to hear that you are basically telling me that you are making a choice to go with this other guy. And that hurts my feelings. And it doesn't make any sense to me why you don't want to be so clear about that. - Do you realize that was much harder? - You deserved it much more. - I know. - Okay, can we go swimming, please? Let's go. Ooh! (water splashing) - [Lucy] See anything. - [Jake] Do you wear glasses? - [Lucy] No, I need to get them... - See, I am in the same position as you. - Really? - I have terrible eyesight. - [Lucy] I used to have amazing eyes. - Me too! And it's getting worse by the fucking day. And I drive a car and you don't. - Have the good stuff, not like me. - And you're smart. - You should get glasses. - I drive a large killer... - You should get glasses, Have you ever had glasses? - Yeah, I got these glasses, right here. - You could get both. - And you've always had contacts? That's what everybody tells me, but I think if you're wearing lenses... - I think I do wear like... - You're asking a great question. Well, remember the thing we discussed earlier, the internet and television? - The internet is not outside on giant screens. - Not yet. - He say, oh, I'll tell you what though, I'm starting to feel more. I'm starting to feel more west, I'm starting to feel more east and everything is moving to television. That's when DonChristian's rock concerts started, he invested in all that TV, or live, or rock shows. He said, Santana had a cocaine habit, blah-blah-blah back in those days. And so-and-so, somebody's drugs was being used in the Haight-Ashbury district. (gentle rock music) - [DJ] Now, we've got a special guest, JumpBack Jake in the house! Let's hear it for JumpBack Jake!

(laughing) - You don't get it? - No, and I wouldn't presume to like, know you so quickly, but there's this thing about the way that you're so... - Do you have a pimple? - No! I have got so many bug bites. - That's a bug bite on your armpit? - Yeah, a lot of them. - Stop! - I can't see it. - I don't want to show you. Like, okay, um, nevermind, forget it, forget it. Can I have some of that? - If you show me your pimple. (ice clinking) Drink this and then tell me what you were going to say. - It's not a pimple and I don't need to drink that to tell you what, but I will. Thank you. Stop! - I'll show you anything about me. - I don't want to show you, it's not a pimple, I just got a lot of bug bites all over. Lucy has like 700 bug bites right here, and she's really uncomfortable about it. And you would never make her show you. (ice clinking) (rock music playing) - What's this? - This is a big star. - That doesn't sound good. - Speakers are fucked up. (music waxing and waning) Sorry. - It's okay. - I'll take you along that dream. Take your fucking dress off. (car idling) (footsteps crunching on gravel) (insects buzzing) - Come on, pal. (water splashing) Come on Jim, come on buddy. Come on, pal, let's go. Come on, pal. Come on, Jim. - I knew you were going to do it in here. - I have to go in a minute, can you pause it? - Yeah, sorry. - So I know that you guys have gotten like bits and pieces of this, but basically it looks like I have to leave town for awhile and I have to go back to New York. And I don't know when, I mean probably indefinitely because I lost my job here, as you know, and put everything in storage. But it's a drag, but it just, it seems like it's a good way for me to come up for air from this whole thing. And, so I don't know. And as far as we're concerned, I mean, like, I think that there's, I don't know, I think that we've had a really good year. I mean, we've put a record out, we've done a lot of regional touring. I think we could've done more obviously, but I mean, we've done a lot and it wasn't that successful. So, I mean, I don't really feel the need to keep going to those kinds of places right now. So, you know, plus you guys have the new thing going and you know, it's, it's, it's not a bad time for us to sort of take a pause, spend some time with the demos that we've cut and sort of figure out what we need to re-cut, what we want to do with them in the studio. You know, encourage everybody to listen to them and, and, and think about that. But I just want to tell you guys that and just give you a sense of what was going on. But I mean, you know, obviously we're all still totally committed to this and we'll keep doing it. - Yeah, man. - That's all I got. (door squeaking) - Hey. - Hi. How you doing? - Great. (door thumping) How are you doing? - Okay. Why don't you just continue what you're doing and as you're doing it... - [Jake] Put the records away? Yeah, no, in boxes, yeah. - [Jake] Right. - And as you're doing it, make a pile for what you want to keep. Think boxes, keep and everything else that you don't want as you're putting it in there, we'll make a pile, okay? - Okay. - Pile of my stuff, pile of throw aways, pile of giveaways. (Lynn groaning) - So what do you have to tell me? - I mean, just the I've been in relationships in the past few years and they've all ended in like horrible tragedy. And it's like, they're always aware of you. It's always like this big contention because I just, I can't let go of you. - There's a bunch of music shit in there. - [Lynn] Yeah. - That could probably go into storage, I don't know if I need to bring it with me, I don't know yet. - [Lynn] Do you want it though, in this case? - I don't fucking know. Am I going to like record it in my mother's house? I don't think so. - [Lynn] You could, it could be a concept to help. - Yeah, right. - [Lynn] Okay. - That's what that email meant? - Yeah, that's, that's big. That's a big deal. - Well, what do I expect? - Expect from... - That's it, it's a big deal that you've been in a relationship in the last two years or one year and a half. That's a big deal? - I don't know, I guess our expectations are completely different. (bicycles clattering) (engine humming) (door thumping) (bird squawking) (door squeaking) (train clicking rhythmically) - You should probably go. - Yeah. - You all right? You all right? - Come buddy, sit. - I'll love him. - Okay. 33, 32. (upbeat rock music) (roller-shutter clattering) (boxes thumping) (roller-shutter clattering) (lock clicking) (keys jangling) (upbeat rock music)
