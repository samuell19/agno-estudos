GOLD, REVOLUTION AND BANDITS! - Take me with you. - I do not like. Never with a virgin. Please sir ! I'm sorry, Father. But our father is blind and dying. He wants the priest to confess. Unfortunately, I do not confess. I'm a Protestant. The old man will not let you know that you are not a Catholic. Come on. - Not ! - Calm down. Don't worry. - Who are you? - The priest. "Go back to your flock." I can't be helped. I'm a priest for souls. Your sons told me ... I have no son! Who are these young people? Three sons of bitches! They beat me to tell them where the gold is hidden. - Is there a lot of hidden gold, old man? - Lots of gold ... A lot of gold ... was loaded on mules, and then ... One million dollars were buried in the ground. - Think how many poor people we will save if we find this gold! If the gold is unearthed. - That's true. - Hear me out. - Wait a minute. - Of course. Ticolosul ! "Gold, old man!" - It belongs to the governor of Sonora. When he was raised in the revolution, he had to hide it. He ordered me to do this. Because he needed someone who was blind. "But if you're blind, you don't know where he's buried. " Maybe I'm blind, but I'm not stupid. In a part of a small abandoned town to the north, called Piedras Negras. I went there with the mules and hid the gold. It is in a safe place. But where ? Piedras Negras is a big city. I don't know exactly where he is buried. I'm blind, but another man knows. "Someone who can tell you more." - Who? Try to remember. Think of the poor. A man named Lozoya. He is being held in Yuma for murder. What did this old bastard tell you? Confession is secret, my children. Go with God. - Speech, Dad! - Tell us, Father. Tell us what happened inside. Here is your answer, you fat bastards! This is Yuma. A famous prison. Henry Davis, 242 Wall Street, New York. Buy Ford shares. The 5% margin is 100,000 shares. The telegraph will send this to you. Is something wrong? Isn't it a good investment? - Of course. The priesthood is still a business instinct . - God leads us. - Do you know this man? - Yes, this is our new sheriff. If anyone wants to escape, he ends up dead. As detainees. He 's serious, isn't he? Kelly ! - Sheriff Randall? This is Mary O'Donnell. - I'm not the sheriff, he is. ªerif Randall, Marry O'Donnell. I received your telegram. We are waiting for you. Please take a seat. - To cancel the meeting. - Because of an accident? - I hope you recover. - When I'm dead. Let's get to business. How? - For what ? - To help the prisoner escape. - A friend ? - I haven't met him. - $ 500 for an ordinary prisoner. He is a Mexican hero. Ramon Mendez, known as El Salvador. For such an important person. It costs $ 1,000! - Why should I trust you? - You do not have a choice. - You're very solid. - Inflexible. - I'm seeing. You are Irish. What do you care about an old Mexican man? That's my job. These are yours. Tonight you will need both. Another escaped from prison? Another reward for us. We will be at the "three crosses." Prisoners are worth more than gold. Friends pay for their freedom, And the state pays ... to catch them. Dead or alive. - I do not live. When you're dead, you can't give up. Be careful! - It was a robbery. Over $ 10,000. - Where? At the church in Dorset during the marriage! How many were there? Only one. - A Russian prince. This time disguised as a priest. Looks like he'll be mine, my dear cousin, and I'll meet him again. That made me look like a turtle! Here, Father. You better go ahead. Lozoya was quite gentle. Right for me, it's always beautiful. Dear and gentle. I came to confess to you. Do you want to ruin my last meal? This is my last night. And last chance to ease your soul. Of course it's very dirty ... Lord, accept the confession of this sinner. Pray for your forgiveness. Amen. - Amen! Even a thief like you can be saved if he does a good deed. What do you want to say ? You have to donate something to the poor! - Poor people? They are richer than me. I'll be hanged at dawn. - But you know where the gold is hidden. - I'm sorry, I'm a little deaf. - What you said ? - The hidden gold of the governor of Sonora. - That's how you find out if your soul is saved. - You can not. I'm going to hell. - Why, son? - Because there are whores. "Then you will go to hell with your bones broken!" Is that what you want? Okay, what do you want from me? - The confessions of a sinner who knows where the gold is hidden. "But you should bless me before the confession begins." Oh, that's true. Thanks. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, and so on ... - Can I finish my dinner sooner? - Of course, son. Now tell me about the gold. So ... - When I was 14. - Forget the sins of childhood. Start with ... the present. Dad told me that if you want to wash, don't just wash your head. Take it off your feet and then go upstairs. If I want to purify my soul, I have to ... start with the beginning. Isn't that right? - That's true. When I was 14, a thief stole my tortilla. I turned it over. - This is not a sin. - Then I killed him. - It's a shame. Keep going. When I was 15, an idiot called me a bastard ... - So you killed him. - How do you know? I see you're consistent. Keep going. - When I was 16 ... - How old are you, Lozoya? I'm 45 now. Hello, Governor. Tonight we will do a good job. This is your half. - Why double this time? - It's worth it. They want the rebel El Salvador. - El Salvador? But he's been dead for 6 months. He will escape again. - Will you resurrect him? - We'll replace him. All Mexicans are the same. A girl who pays doesn't know him. Does not matter. When I'm done with her, my mother won't recognize him either. Let me check. Correct. Could it be Lozoya? He will be hanged tomorrow. He'll be dead anyway. Talk to people and be sure to send it. I killed two men with my knife, I strangled three men with their bare hands. Then they caught me. That's all. Will I receive the remission of sins, Father? "When are you going to say something about gold?" - I don't know anything about gold! Jur. When a man swears before he dies, you must believe him. Give me your hand, my son. Right. I'm lying. You know something. I ... I just know that when the governor knew he could be killed, he sent President Diaz's two men to tell them where the gold was. To make sure he didn't steal the gold he gave them to everyone half a map. "Weren't they able to connect?" He wouldn't have used them. He only showed them the place ... where the gold was buried. He did not show them in which village. Only the governor and the president know this . - I have a feeling you know that. - Do you know the names of the people who own the map? Why say. Oh, father! I don't know, it's not appropriate. - I knew from the beginning that you were a snake! - You're right, Lozoya. Electricity. A brilliant invention. This is just the beginning, my dear cousin. It would be too easy ... for a Russian prince to die like that. Put the threads in his mouth! Iferifule. If we don't start with Lozoya, it will be too late. Stop it. I'll be back later. Then you will die, cousin. Hey, ridicã-te. Let me sleep. It's too early to hang out. Let me sleep. It's too early to hang out. - Who's waiting for me? - Someone who paid for your escape. Did he pay for me? This way, Mexicans. The bastard, a priest, is making fun of me. Take me to him. Someone paid me to shoot. You set a trap for me, right? I have nothing to do with her. You don't deserve my saliva either, thief! God knows how much I hate you, but you know the name of the village, damn it! And you know where the map is. You disgust me, but we will be partners. - Didn't you forget something? - What the ? "Your blessing!" So you are. I was waiting for you. They are waiting for you on the hill at the "three crosses". "Three crosses." You are ... Come on. Damn prison! They destroyed me. I'm weak. My back ! - I'm Mexican! - So what ? Nobody touches my ass! That can't happen. Do you understand, gringo? I understand. If that didn't happen, it 's still a way to get more involved. 11723. I can not. I'm not in shape. My liver is bad. I can not see. I'm blind as a bat! If you don't hurry, you'll be a dead bat! - The rabbit ran away. "Look for a hole in the ground." You have to find it. I can not do this anymore. My heart... - You're fine. - Me? - Yes. Where are you going ? - Up to "three crosses". That's what I was told. - Exactly. If you go there, "three crosses" will become "five crosses." It's a trap. - Leave it to me. - Joe! - What are you doing here ? - The Russian escaped. "They ran away together." - We understand that the Russian is not coming here. If I hadn't put on my glasses wrong, I see you're two! What is El Salvador? Which one of you is there? - He ... - He is! - Who the hell are you? Prince Dimitri Vasilovich Orlowsky adviser in his service. - In what ? - At your disposal. But not for long, if we don't get out of here. The prince is right. But there are only two horses, and there are three of us. The redhead is mine. Of course. Miss ... Let me help you. Come on! We'll leave them now. We need more people and fresh horses. Let's go ! Why did you help us escape? For the Mexican revolution. We need to get rid of strangers. Mexico is far away and the horses are tired. We are close to the border. The most beautiful day of my life will be on November 2nd. Isn't it "Day of the Dead"? On this day we will enter St. Thomas. There people are waiting for us on the water ... So ... the arrival of El Salvador will cause a great revolution. El Salvador, hey El Salvador ... Mexico needs you! In St. Thomas, El Salvador will cause a great revolution. This is ! On November 2! So let's go. We will destroy all traitors! We will bathe them in blood! Long live Mexico! And maybe the Blessed Virgin will protect El Salvador. Excuse me, do you have a message for me? This is Mary O'Donnell. Yes, you have a telegram from the New York Times. It costs $ 1. Payment in cash, please. Congratulations ! There are photos of the leader of the El Salvador revolution in every newspaper. What do you want? This is Mary O'Donnell. Immediately, ma'am. You have a dirty tongue. What are you doing ? Are you normal? This is not included in the price! I apologize. I didn't mean to offend you. Of course. How not? Get your tongue out! And yours is dirty. I suffer from insomnia. Take this. It really doesn't bother me. I'll take all this ... What happens ? Well ... nothing. I'm waiting for El Salvador on horseback. Let's go then. "But you told me the price was $ 200 for a horse. " The minimum bid is $ 1,000 for Mexicans fleeing the law. This will not happen again. Do you recognize that? Take a look. Look for the last time ... El Salvador. That's not me. You look so much better now. What happened ? - They quarreled over the price of horses. Terrible. - Does not matter. - We'll find other people in St. Thomas. - I'll look around. - Feed the horses. That's what the Russian did. No, he's Mexican. It's his style. They were killed about an hour ago. Hurry up. We'll be in Mexico in another hour. The Mexican? No, the Russian. He let the water flow. Come on, bitch. - Speak to him in Spanish. We're in Mexico. Spanish ? "Come on, lime." - He led us far enough. "We'll get rid of her tonight." - Not until I get my right. - She's a virgin and a Catholic. - Anyway, you don't know what to do with her. - You know what? What is the method? Are you a military adviser? I'll tell you if you tell me the names of the two people who know where the gold is hidden. Correct. I'll tell you. Hand, please. Right. Manuel Mendoza de Medina. Tomas Gomez, San Miguel Ayenda. Method? You have to wash yourself first. You can. - I can't. The horse ! - You are. Second, you need to get your hair cut. - My hair ? In the third line. I'll tell you ... About love ... the secrets of ancient Greece. - Greece ? - From ! Is awesome. Yes it is. My uncle, the Grand Duke, gave it to me . - Why did you leave Russia? "Who's left in Russia?" "She needs a good revolution." - Go to sleep. - Don't you like it? You guessed it. - You. I hope you sleep. I will sleep if you leave me alone. It's wonderful here, besides you. - There's a nice smell of musk. - This is me. - You? See... El Salvador. I barely recognized you. My face is different, but my heart beats ... - Bate? - Yes, beat! - For ancient Greece. "For ancient Greece!" - For Greece? - Yes ! Where were the men, the men and the women ... Virgins ...! In Greece, Virgo gave the Greeks revolutionaries before the battle, So we have to leave something behind. Tomorrow will be the battle of St. Thomas. And so, tonight ... Good night. What have you done with this thing, apologize for ancient Greece. Because, you gave me the two names. Are you crazy God, you were looking for El Salvador! - I wanted a souvenir. Too much comedy! You are a journalist who wants to revolutionize the newspaper. He is not El Salvador! He's an ordinary thief. ªtiu, east Lozoya. - What are you planning to do ? - Russian, what is a "journalist"? The one who makes an idol and then destroys it. Like now, it seems. Welcome to Mexico! Now, my dear lady, we're killing an animal, we're taking its skin, And as we can see, we will squeeze her skin and crush her bones. Be good, General, shoot them! This type of torture is cruel. Impossible. Shots will be heard in the distance And ... they will have a big effect on the population. But your beauty and beautiful hair will save them. "Will you forgive them?" - Oh no ! I'm just going to hang them. The rope. You are free now. Because you're a stranger. And since you are a journalist, you will benefit from our honor. Damn, bitch! I hope you enjoyed this modest meal. This is proof that Mexicans know how to receive guests. I did everything I could for them, but if I forgive El Salvador, it will destroy my country. You have a rope for me! I'm going. I'm not El Salvador. - I'm just an ordinary thief, honestly. - It's a shame as a hero to be scared to death! - I'm not a hero. I told you I'm a regular thief. That's how I was born. In my blood. You do not believe me ? Take a look. See what I have on my pants. See, I'm a thief! You! Tell him I'm not El Salvador! I'm a regular thief. Tell him, you know I'm not El Salvador! This man is El Salvador, General, I can assure you. As a journalist, I photographed him. Everyone would like to see him. - He was never photographed there! - I'll be honored. Special treatment for you, El Salvador. - My hat, please. - Hat! Hat? I've heard a man want boots before he dies, but a hat? A Russian prince always wears a hat before his execution. - Thank you. - Tie their hands! Lozoya, my friend, now that you're dying, tell me the names of the two men. I do not believe you. Not even dead. - Why do you think redhead? - Yes, well ... - Yes, well. Yes, we would have escaped if he had n't told us, we wouldn't be hanging now. - I would like to bring her to this position. - I'll just have the picture. General, are you doing me a favor? I want a souvenir. - Are you taking a picture of all three of us? - I am very happy. - All done. - Just click here. - Good. Be careful not to cut yourself! I'm a better thief than you. Now ! Say Cheese". One two Three... I don't want to prolong this, but wouldn't it be better for me to be in a group with you? I would be honored, General. Motorcycle fast! - Give me the knife! - I didn't have a knife. This one? - No no no ! - No, no, not how do we do it? Not in horses. - Thank you. - Good. Hey, look! Come on! It's a great place for a funeral. Come on! El Salvador, you did pretty well. Why do you persist with El Salvador? You know I'm an ordinary thief. The revolutionaries are waiting for us in St. Thomas. They need a leader. In their eyes, you are a hero. When we get to the "Day of the Dead" fun ... I would rather live this entertainment. You will go alone to the "Day of the Dead" party. Hey! Wait for me! What knight are you? Leave a lady here! Stop it! You are an American and a foreigner in my country. I can't find it a reason to cooperate with you. - There's a good reason, General. This thing. A small gift from the prince. Let me go anywhere in Mexico, people And my hatred will do the rest. - Believe ? We were trying to get him back to Yuma. I still haven't succeeded. Strange, isn't it? The sooner my joy will be when I catch him. There is no other reason. I think I'm looking for something more On their way, it seems. Something important. - Captain ... - I feel this is not a bad idea. You want the Mexican, General. You will have it. I want Russian. - Alive. - Good. In terms of prizes, I will give you money to find both. - Is this the first man we found? - Yes. His name ? Manuel Mendoza. It is very harsh and very dangerous. He won't be the first person I've met. Yes, trust me. When he was born, his mother died of a heart attack when he saw her! - Hey, El Salvador. - El Salvador ... Idiots. But this time they are right. I'm worth twice as much as you. Listen, go there and try to find out where Mendoza is. I'm tired of you, but from now on, don't leave. You do not believe me ? - I believe you, but I don't want to risk it. Two tequila for us. No, thank you. I do not drink. Russian, I'll show you how to drink. See ? Single. With lemon. Now look. Man, did you hear that ... By the way, can I ask you something? Do you know where Manuel Mendoza lives? - Pedregal. Do you know him - I do not like. Maybe that's why we're alive. Hey Russian! Don't you have tequila in Russia? What time ? Rus bastard. Come on. Hot murdar! Don't worry, General Calahan. Everyone wants to make money. They will accept the conditions. The condition of the contract is 1 pesos per day. Record it there. - One peso? We cannot lead such a life. It's not fair. Must be at least 3 pesos a day. Mexico is a free country. You can go there if you want. It's rubbish. He prefers a job to retaliation. One pesos? All right, General Mendoza. One peso a day. Sign here. - How much do you want ? - A million dollars. One million dollars, sir. "Do you want me to raise my hands?" - No, I want a million dollars. I want you ! Go. Get moving! Surround him! We're going to drown the rat! Let go of the water! On him ! Shoot, you bastards! - Help ! - I'm glad to see you. I left you alone, I can't stand a Mendoza. Generos mai eºti. Is that why you put my watch in my pocket? - That's all. - It's hot here. - Help me, my friend. - You need a bathroom. It smelled like a goat. Looks like you did it in private to talk to Mendoza ... '' Not me! "Help me, my friend!" - Please. - I can't swim! Help ! - You want to fuck me, don't you? - I swear, I don't ... - Yeah, I wanted to fuck you ... damn it. - That's great ! Where is the map? He can't be uglier than he is. Only I can get the information. Take off your pants. - Are you a sex maniac? I just want the map. For a safer place at the bank in Mexico. - Where? - On one of the cheeks. - What the ? I told you the governor was cruel. Every Mexican would rather die than show his bare buttocks. We'll see if you're a real Mexican. Take off your pants! What times do we live in? Southwest of the fountain. However, at what distance? We learned this from each other. Get dressed. You did a good job. I don't want to see you again. You are a disgrace to all Mexicans. - Only after you. - No, according to you. - You saved my life. - We all make mistakes. I hope I can clarify this. And after all, who are you? Will you talk now or in the barracks? Do you want to go to the barracks with yourself, or just show them the way? Long live our savior! Trãiascã El Salvador ! Who told them I was El Salvador? I don't know, but they're your fans. Let me through. Calm down. Just a moment. Hold the camera. Happiness! Good boy ! These people believe in you, El Salvador. He would follow me to hell if necessary. And now we're going to St. Thomas. It's "Day of the Dead." "Leave the dead alone!" - Long live El Salvador! Explain to your people the political goal, El Salvador! Friends! All strangers are whores, they are ... I mean, they're someone's son. And they will not join us. In Mexico ... I am your leader. Mexico is ours! In my revolution, all prisons are closed, And ... all the banks are open. - Good luck! Long live! I mean, nobody's going to jail anymore ... And ... everyone will be able to rob a bank and get rich. "Finally, we'll release all the money!" - Good luck! Long live! A rich man will have to share the money with me. In fact, I mean, the rich have to share the money with the poor. And the poor will have that ... - Tráiaskan Revolution ! - Thraskan! Thraskan! Trãiascã! Trãiascã! Friend, go back to your wives. - We're all bachelors. - We're all bachelors. Are you a bachelor? It will never be possible to snatch gold. Amigos, El Salvador wants all detainees released. He and she agree to release the prisoners. - We're all with you! - We're all with you! - Good. Then sit here and guard your piece of land. Go there. That's all. You can play with this gun, but this is where the whole revolution is stored. Stay aºa. May ? Do I invite you to lunch? No, we want you to release the prisoners. Actually no. We want you to arrest this revolutionary. Who, me? Gãrzi! "Stop it!" - I'm a conservative Catholic. Don't think you're going to get rid of me. Oh, I'm sorry. Wow, what a mare! - Isn't 2,000 pesos on her head? And a price is put on the Russian's head. The price is 5,000 pesos. Thank you very much. Much obliged. I also know that El Salvador is worth 10,000 pesos. Of course. Thanks. Hey! Here ! El Salvador is in danger! Quick ! He abandoned us! No, my friends. El Salvador will not abandon us! Where's the other man? - On the other side of the river. - But I'm not going to this one! - I want my horse! - The engine is faster. It has only three wheels. We need something with four wheels. This thing is dangerous. Shake. We will die in it. They are not soldiers, mother. Prince, she's my sister. She is a queen. She's not so happy to see you. Miguelito, you grew up! Hold this. Protect the hat from his life. - Is this your motorcycle? - No, it's his. - I prefer horses. - Who is he ? - The prince ... - The prince. "Who is the prince?" - Tell Miguelito. Did your mother tell you a story? My mother didn't tell me a story because she doesn't speak. Her husband was killed by soldiers. He was a revolutionary. It's bothered ... They asked her ... where are the others? She didn't want to. They cut off his tongue. Don't think I haven't changed. I'm a different man. I'm an important man now. Four came to me and started firing. I told you, Lozoya, these soldiers must be killed! That's when I started shooting better, the soldiers fled. Then 1,000 people gathered around me. They all shouted, "Long live the Revolution, long live El Salvador!" Why don't you take me with you? Because we have to go on our own, to find something very important. Gold. - Where? Where? Where? In Piedras ... Somewhere around here. Somewhere around here. What will you do with the gold? I will give something for the revolution. And something for you. I brought him some money. I was not joking. Look. I didn't steal them. Jur. I honestly won them over. It's a reward for catching two dangerous bandits. 17,000 pesos. 17,000 pesos? What the ? He also stole my share of the prize. He's a Mexican bitch! But, well ... Come to me, Miguelito. I'll tell you a story about the magic clock. 17,000 pesos. Goodbye, Miguelito! Goodbye, Lupita! Thanks for the tracks! You forgot your watch, prince. Don't you want him anymore? It's musical. I have not forgotten. I own a motorcycle. It's yours. - What's the man's name? - What's the town? If you talk first, you'll fuck me. - The Trenches. - I do not believe. - Henry Ford. - Cine e ? My new car. I paid $ 200,000 for it. If he dies, it broke. Tell me the name of the town. He swears by Henry Ford. - Piedras Negras. I swear on Henry Ford. - It's your turn. - Horatio Villegas. Hand, please. No, the wound will become infected. You have to believe me. Good. But if you lie , I'll hang your fingers. "Where does Villegas live?" - There. Is very dangerous. More dangerous than Mendoza. I'll show you the trophies collected by Horatio Villegas. See ? They belonged to the famous gunmen of Mexico. Villegas killed them all with a bullet in the head! From the stand, Rodrigo Chico Velasques, Pepe Aguayo, Jose Ruiz ... Garcia known as Tiger, Julio Lopov. And ... many others, believe me. Hello. - Where's Villegas? Horatio Villegas? - In the garden. Thanks. Stop. Villegas ! Horatio Villegas ! Get out if you have the courage! Horatio! Are you afraid of me? Horatio ! It's just not for us. I'm sorry, buddy, but the treasure hunt is over. Too bad ... Nothing holds us together anymore. You won't believe that, my friend, but it will be hard for me to leave you. I'm more sorry than you are. Lozoya. Yes my friend ? - I want one last favor. - As you wish. Drop the gun. - Now take off your pants. "You're kidding!" I hate to undress a corpse. Take off your pants. - Never. I'm Mexican. Never? 28 steps to the right and 34 steps to the left. What times do we live in? Where are the Mexicans? Don't give up. Let's not get angry. One last "goodbye" drink. Do you like it After you. Drink. Drink. Good. Where did you get it? - From a Russian prince and my uncle, El Salvador. Show us on the map where they went. I want to know where I am! Otherwise, I'll take your eyes off you. "I'll tell you!" - Well ? I will say ! It doesn't hurt. They went to find gold. Stop it! I knew something was behind them that they had escaped. - Talpan? Where is he? - Sepulveda, Piedras Negras ... And here's Talpan. About 40 miles from here. We will not arrive on time. Tell General Huerta. Sergeant, take care of her. Northwest of the fountain, bottom left. 28 and 34 steps in the right bottom. I will buy you 100 slaves when I return to Moscow. We will see. This weapon is not bad. A gift from the emperor? Thanks, you saved me from digging. You see, El Salvador has friends everywhere. What would you have done? I would have thought. It's not very good. Your brain will weaken. Stand there. One of the teachers may have come here. If you dig, there will be something free to put in a museum. The biggest bastard in the world. You see, my mind is as strong as granite. Drink. No, still drink. - I was thirsty. "I'll strangle you with my bare hands!" I'll give you a new bottle, don't worry. Vestã. Around here. This gold is the reward for all the problems you have specified. Dear Prince, I'm sorry I can't afford a dignified death. But it will only take 12 hours. For now, leather belts will put an end to your agony. Just like I promised Randall. Goodbye, gentlemen. - Stop. Come on! - Come on, people. pornography. hi ! My friend, if you think it's painful, let's wait for the light of day! - Maybe the rain in the morning. - Never. How do you know? - My leg. That's the only thing that doesn't hurt. - If you had a brain, it broke. - Hey, buddy? What would be the most difficult to leave in this world of fuck? The $ 200,000 Ford. Isn't that right? None. Ah, yes ... My sister and Miguelito. I won't see them again. - Don't be so sure. - What the hell could save us? If you're not optimistic, don't be a thief. What a fist combination! Do you want more ? - Let's play a game. - Whichever ? - Which side is the bayonet on? - Which hand? To stay ? - I do not like. Lower. - Not like that! Put them in the balls! Put them in the balls! - This is ! "Better them than death." - I'm not sure. - This is a wonderful place, isn't it? - Why don't you take pictures? Good idea ! I'll take the camera and I'll be back in half an hour. - No, wait! Don't you have a mother? - Mother ? - There must be a bitch. Nice "welcome" after you've done it for me. "Do you want me to release you?" - If you stay, yes. My glasses! Now what ? I can't see without them. Get a bayonet! Here they are. See... You have a bloody bayonet. Use it! I can't decide whether to kill you or set you free. "We can all be in St. Thomas tomorrow." "Better an uncertain death today," than confident tomorrow! "Huerta took the gold from St. Thomas." Better a poor horse than no horse at all. Get off your horse. Quick ! Come on. Easy. Down there. There are traces of them. They must be here somewhere. You go up, go there! They came here, and then they left their horses. What are we doing ? - I don't need you anymore. Go to General Huerta Send greetings to him. We will follow you. - He knows we're here. How did he know we were at Piedras Negras? Someone told them. I'm going to kill as many bands as my sister has on her hair. St. Thomas. I just want to be there. Come on! Wait for me in St. Augustine and then I'll take you to St. Thomas. How many people do we have? - Not many, but they are the last revolutionaries. - They're all 20. - That's enough. Enough. Lord, twenty angels will defeat Satan. Only God can rely on these people. - Take a picture! Open your eyes. This is a revolution. There are no more heroes in St. Thomas. You and I can work it out. Just give me an idea. - I have an ideea. I am leaving. - Not ! Wait! We find the entrance and the only way out. - You can come in before it closes. - Are you a military adviser? We advise you not to die! There is a plush army! - The general may call for a backup. "Will you let the soldiers go with the gold?" Better to be poor and alive than rich and dead. Wait a minute! You are an ordinary person! - Naughty, arrogant, selfish ... - Leave her alone. When you're crazy, you're really beautiful, honestly. Take off your glasses a little. I've been waiting a long time for this moment. - Now we're up to our necks. - There's no going back. There is only one way. In St. Thomas. Good. It's time to dump her and move on. If you're interested in the revolution, and not just the news, I give you a chance to sacrifice something. Don't expect too much. Naked or dressed, we don't care. No, you could be of great interest to General Huerta. Did you understand? You wanted a military adviser. These are my orders. "Couldn't you think of a better idea?" - Do you want gold or not? - Of course, there is a machine gun in the back. - Give it to me. They have trucks protected by iron. I've never seen a virgin before, like the daughter of the president of the bank. Yes very good. Good enough. I accepted you as an admirable lady of honor. You were welcomed into the camp, and you proved ungrateful as a woman. Now I can lock you up, torture you, strangle, disfigure, destroy ... There are many ways to kill women, General. - I know everything. Even the comfortable ones? Without glasses, I feel a little ... naked. It's hot here. My clothes are uncomfortable. Yes, let me help you. You know ... Could you please close the windows? Pleacã! In Mexico, using these candies can lead to death. We'll use them to kill. I want to talk to you. You are not El Salvador. - Who are you? - One of the survivors, who knew El Salvador. - But, listen ... - It's okay. Mexico needs a flag. It is important for El Salvador's life, even if he is like you. What happens ? - None. I'm a Mexican flag. General, I'm thirsty. Take a drop of wine to help you. Get here. God bless you, El Salvador. You will live forever. I-and thirsty. The revolution is on. Red is definitely under control. General, please make sure no one enters. Sergeant, I don't want anyone to come in. For whatever reason. It's an order. Whoever enters will be shot. I bet he won't sleep. If the Irishwoman does her job, We don't have to worry about tanks. Announce the general. We are under attack from all sides. - He ordered not to be disturbed. - Seriously ? I will take the lead. Attention, folks! Where are you going ? I have to take command of the tanks to go into battle. We must resist. The general can fight the enemy, but ... in her underwear. "Cover me, my friend!" "Cover me, you mad Russian!" I'm not as crazy as you! For the Emperor! What are you doing here ? - I ... covered you. - I want to talk to you. - Do you want to talk to me? - Yes. Now cover me! - Do you want to kill a snake? - Pe Huerta. - You have to cut off his head. "I don't think you're that close to gold." - I don't have any more ammunition. If you fall, it's bad luck! Come on! Haideþi, bãieþi! The revolution is more important. You need us not lead. Never give up. Trãiascã El Salvador ! Where is Huerta? - It's me! - Who are you? - Prince Dimitri Vasilovich Orlowsky, military adviser. Why aren't you out with the others? Cãþea oarbã irlandezã ! Quick ! - Gold. - I won! This will be the title of the decade! El Salvador launches a new revolution! "A new revolution!" - Go to hell ! You, the revolution and El Salvador. El Salvador? Lozoya? Lozoya! Friend! Where is the gold? - There's nothing left. That's all that's left. - Tell me where it is. - I shared it with people. I don't use it. Gold has gone in a thousand directions. Thank you, sir. It will be for medication. Children will no longer suffer. - We'll build a school. - In your memory. - Hospitals. Damn fool! Why did you give them gold, when half of it is mine? My friend, several people like Miguelito and my sister died. And many more will die if they cannot defend themselves when the soldiers return. With this gold we will be able to buy weapons. We'll be in Aguirre tomorrow. I can't betray the people. My friend, we'll find more gold! We will work together and we will do it! There are many banks! - I wouldn't trade a million dollars for your ass! You are. Come up with an idea. The next photo will be with your funeral! Remember, never leave empty-handed ... - Are there enough weapons for everyone? - Yes. Two carts with 300 rifles, 3 machine guns, 2,000 rounds of ammunition, 10 kg of dynamite. This cart is empty, El Salvador. They fooled us. - These too. "Do you think we were wrong?" We need weapons and ammunition. No, I will win! Drop your weapons! This is what I want. I don't want any more bloodshed! Drop your weapons, that's an order. I said I wouldn't leave empty-handed. How much do you have to pay for betrayal, luda? The general and the overrated, he offered me $ 20,000 that I already took, because you don't know how to think. Do not be sad. This is not a "goodbye". I will always be with you. I can't just give them their names. There will be more valuable people which will lead you. Remember, those who love freedom ... Idols are not necessary. Those who are not idols are not enough. - Stop saying nonsense! - Sergeant ! Drop the gun. Put it there. Can I send an old friend to his last resting place? Thanks. Go ahead! Follow me. May ? Thanks. Brigade! Attention! Look! Fire ! I'd say the execution was perfect, wouldn't I, prince? Too bad it won't help the next one. I meant yours. They are all so well prepared. I'm surprised you didn't wait. I'm getting ready for this! I prepared very well! As a gift, I will give you the coup de grace, with his own hand. - Thank you. - It was an honor to meet you. Goodbye, General. I let you survive Piedras Negras, cousin, because I knew you would lead us to gold. We will get rid of this coffin. It will be a big meal. The corpse, Russian prince! Open it ! You're wrong, my dear cousin, as always. Remember when ... - I do not want to hear ! - Gold was given to people. Damn it ! You have to know how to handle bullets, you idiot. How did you live after the execution? You are full of surprises, prince. This time you have reached the end. The honest thief never dies without a hat. Right, prince? Yes. He just doesn't take his eyes off her. Randall, my friend, I bow to you before my stronger opponent. Can I have one last drink? Do not rush. I can look so ... - Thank you. "Can an honest thief smoke one last cigarette?" - Yes, take a deep breath. It's not going to take very, very long ... - What happened between you and your cousin? - A family business. Get it here, you deserve it. Part of the prize ... - Great speech. You almost convinced me. - You almost fooled me ... And you with the execution! People now have a martyr, on El Salvador. But he's dead. Now, I can be an honest thief again. - The revolution has broken out. - Villa and Zapata are in control! Mexico has revolted! Our job is over here! But I have new information. The three of us together, We can create a coup in Guatemala. The people there are ready. If they're ready, we can go take a look at them and their social conditions ... and ... "There's a ton of gold there." - In which direction is Guatemala? - The south. - If the earth is really round, we will meet there in 10 years. The north! How ungrateful. Damn bastards! Be a whore! Father, do you want to comfort this poor child? - Yes of course... Kiss us in the ass! END
