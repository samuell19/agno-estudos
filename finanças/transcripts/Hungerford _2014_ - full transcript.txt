[static hissing] [clears throat] [siren wailing in distance] [cell phone chimes] [exhales] Good morning. [clears throat] My name is Cowen Rosewell. And this is my... this is my BTech Part 2. Mr. Chivers, how you doing, man? And I'm gonna be documenting my life for the next seven days. And today seemed like a good day to start. Well, that is until we all went out on the fucking lash last night. Oh, fuck. Fuck. Phil? Phil? -Phil? -[Phil] What? -Are the boys back? -Yes. That's Phil. It's her flat. Well, her and her brother's, my best mate, Adam. And, yeah, I kinda live here... on the sofa. I know what you're thinking. I think we pissed her off last night. Phil, sweetie? Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, this is Miss Philippa. And we do love her dearly. Mwah! -What are you doing? -Homework, I told you. You all right? -You left me by myself again last night. -No, we didn't. -Yes, you did. -We left you with that guy you like. No, you didn't. You left me with Boring Graham. I thought you liked him. No, I don't like Boring Graham. He's boring. That's why we call him Boring Graham. Okay. Are the boys back, then? -Yes, I think the boys are back. -Is Kipper still here? Kip is always here. -[Cowen] Hey, hey, Kip! -Hey, morning, Cowen. You all right? -Yeah, man, I'm good. You all right? -Yeah, I'm good. Yeah. -Yeah? -Mm. -What time did you get back last night? -11:06. -What time did Adam get back last night? -Later, as usual. 3:32. -What happened? -Just... Adam stuff. -Yeah? -Big Man Dean. -No shit. Go on, out the way, buddy. -Yeah. Oh, Cowen, you smell like liquor and herbs. Thank you, Kipper. Let's see what's lurking behind the door. Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey, brother! -Holy fuck! -Oh, what? -What are you doing? -What the fuck happened last... Right, come on, talk to me. What happened? -Big Man Dean. -No shit. [Phil] Adam. -He's got two of these. -[Cowen] You fuck... -Go on, then... Big Man Dean? -Like, he called you a Powerpuff Girl. -Why does everyone think I'm gay? -It was worse than that. I mean, he was all like, "Oh, why's your wife going home early?" I ain't having that! He's a prick! -Come on, then. I love you. -No, I know. Any time. [Phil] Oh-ho... There they are! Sweetest couple in town! For those who don't know, these two actually have been in love -for quite some time now. -Seriously, Phil? -[Phil] Oh, fuck! -[Cowen] Guys, come on, really? [Adam] You can't leave me alone, can you? I mean, look at you! -No wonder you're still single! -[Cowen] Adam. Right, come on, guys. -Fuck off, Adam. -[Cowen] Enough, enough. -Group shot. -[Adam muttering] Come on. Right, "cheese" on the count of three. One-- [explosion] -[car alarm blaring] -What the fuck was that? Dude, look at that! That's insane! [Cowen] Terry, mate, what the fuck is going on? [panting] How's it going? [sirens wailing] It's this weather. The radios are dead, phones are dead. -The lightning's hit the old factory. -[Cowen] Fuck! -And that's news, that? -[Terry] It's going nuts. -[Cowen] Oh, shit. -Morning, Cowen. Terry, what the bloody hell's going on? [thunder rumbling] -The weather? -Yes, I know! -Phones are dead, radio's dead. -I know. The old factory's been hit by lightning. -It's-- it's just going crazy. -Yes, I know it's going crazy. -What a wanker. -Sort it out. I'm going to the factory. I'm meeting Davis at 12:00. I don't have time for this. -Get on it, meet me up there. -Right on it. [Adam chuckles] [rumbling] So, this is Hungerford. -[booming] -[crowd screaming] [Cowen] Go, go, go! Holy shit! Holy shit! Holy shit! Mate, that was the best hangover cure ever! -Did you see all the lightning? -[Cowen laughs] Yeah! And Terry running around! That bugger. [Phil] Guys, guys, guys, there are firemen everywhere outside. I mean, it's literally packed in town. Gorgeous firemen! -[Adam] You go. -[Cowen] You take it. Mr. Chivers, you bastard, I fucking told you I'd get something good! Ladies and gentlemen, they have destroyed the town hall. Tonight, we party! One, two, three, go! Come on, Phil! -[Cowen] Come on, mate. -[Adam] Come on. [all cheering] [Phil laughs, coughs] -Mah! -You got beat by a girl! I am big booty, okay? -You are number one, you are number two. -[Kipper] You could've told us that. -And you are fatty ass. -Why am I fatty ass? Big booty number-- no! How do you not get this? Okay, a bit more vodka and go. [all cheering] [vomiting] -[Cowen] Shit, are you all right, mate? -[Adam groans] Hey, guys. Is that Janine's dad? -[static hissing] -[Cowen] Holy fuck, it is! -God, he don't look too good. -[Adam] He looks worse than I feel. [Cowen] Oh, shit! Shit! [panting] [laughs] [Cowen] What the fuck is that? Adam, that looks like blood. -Magic! -[Cowen laughs] Film it, film it, film it! Film it. Shh, you'll wake him up. You'll wake him up. -[snoring] -[Phil] No, Adam, you can't do that. [Phil] Oh, Jesus Christ. -Shh, shh, shh... -[Phil mutters] Shh, Phil, shut up! [Phil] Oh, Adam, I think there's a "C" in "sucker." -[Adam] What? -There's a "C" in "sucker." -[Adam] Fuck! -[knocking at door] -[Phil] Shit! -Shit! Fuck. [clears throat] Shh! [Adam] You all right, mate? -[Adam and Phil laughing] -[groans] -[knocking at door] -[Adam] Quick, hurry up! [Phil giggling] Careful with the camera, Phil. -All right? -Okay. It's brilliant, it's brilliant! We're such a good... -What's the matter? -It's Janine. No way. That's brilliant! That's brilliant! -I haven't seen her in six months. -I know, man. -How do I look? -Man, you look gorgeous. -You need to go speak to her. -[Phil] Actually, it's not your best day. Quite frankly, I think you should wait because you're not looking your best. -Fuck off, Phil. -Your hair's a bit-- No, he looks great! I'll sort your hair out, mate. Ah, yes. -Do it like you did it at the party. -Yes, yes, yes! [Phil] No! No! Oh, mate, you look gorgeous. Go get her, man. -Go get her. Go on! -[Phil] Just wait a few months, okay? -[Adam] Go, man! -[Phil] Girls love that. [Adam laughs] [Adam] Go, film him, film him! -[Cowen] Hey. -Hi, Cowen. [clears throat] What are you doing here? -I just got back from uni. -Right. -[Adam] Hey, Janine. -[Phil] Hi. -Hi, Phil, Adam. -[Adam chuckling] I came round to invite you to a party. It's tonight. -[Adam] Party? Can we come? -Oh, yeah! That'd be great. -Yeah, yeah, everyone's invited. -[Adam] Cheers! Cheers! -[Phil] Awesome. -[Adam laughs] -[Cowen] Are you sure you're all right? -Yeah, I'd best be going, though. -You look like you've got... -[Cowen] Don't be silly. -...something going on. -[Cowen] You just got here. Cowen... You've got "cocksucker" written on your forehead. [Adam laughing] No. [Adam] Oh, that's brilliant! That was fucking awesome. Whoa-- [Cowen] Okay, my man, talk me through it, talk me through it. -I've gone for the double denim look. -Nice. -As you can see. Ladies love it. -Yeah. Of course. [both laugh] -[Cowen] What's going on over here? -Um... Well, it's a shirt that I-- my mom got me for Christmas. Yeah? And some new jeans that I also got for Christmas. -[Adam] Real nice, man. -[Cowen] Nice! -[Adam] How are you doing your hair? -Do you not think I should do this? -[Cowen] Are you sure? -Yeah, mate, you look good. So, you gonna get on uni girls, right? [Cowen] Adam, you know there's only one girl I like. -And who's that? -Janine! Pfft! You're with me, ain't you, Kip? Not-- not really my thing, Adam. I'll help you. I'll be your wingman. I mean, I'm up for that. I'm not after a wingman. I'm want someone to get, you know... -Eh... -[sighs] Seriously, guys, you suck. [Kipper] We can't all be an animal like you. [Cowen] And I'm pretty sure we all can't have crabs like you, Adam, as I'm pretty sure your last conquest left you with crabs. -Shut up! -I remember that. You sent me to the pharmacy to get lotion for it. [Cowen] That's right! Holy shit. And you did better. What did yours leave you? -Half a can of deodorant, real sexy! -Fuck off! Guys, are you gonna come down for a drink or what? -[men] Ooh! -[clapping] -[Adam laughing] -[Phil] Come on, Cowen, hurry up! [Cowen] For fuck's sake, guys, I'm coming! -You all right, mate? -[static buzzes] [Cowen laughs] What the fuck? It's only a camera. I mean, seriously, Cowen, these uni girls are up for anything. Adam, you are such a pervert. Look at you all dressed up for Boring Graham. -I am not! -He is coming, though. -He's looking forward to seeing you again. -Oh, go on. -[Cowen] Phil. -Yeah? [Cowen] You look great. -[man] What? Get off me! -[Adam] Oi, mate! [Adam] What are you doing? -[Phil] Come on, Adam, let's go. -[Cowen] Yeah, come on, leave it. -[Cowen] Let them sort it out. -[Adam] What a freak. [Kipper] Come on, Cowen. -[Phil] Is that it? -[Kipper] Whoa. [Cowen] Yeah, that's it. Now I've changed my mind. I think she's perfect for you. Cowen, that says "Happy birthday." [Cowen] Oh, shit! After you. -[Phil exhales] -[sighs] -Why have I got to go? -[Cowen] Because you always go first. -Wh-- -[door opens] What's this? -[Cowen] He's a fucking machine. -[Phil] Oh, my God. -It echoes. -[Kipper] Wow. Wow. -[Adam] Kips. -[Kipper] I like this house. [muffled music playing] -[thudding] -[man grunting] Someone's getting some action already. I told you about uni girls. -[chatter] -[jazz music playing] He's got two of this. [mouths words] Oh, Cowen, there you are! -[Cowen] How are you? -I'm all right. How are you? -I mean, I've been better. -What's going on? [Cowen groans] -It's about her, isn't it? -You know what, it's not. Well... look, she's out there. She evidently invited you because she wants to talk to you. You should go and talk to her. -Really? -Yes, really. -Have I ever told you duff information? -That is true. You wouldn't be here if you didn't even like her a teeny bit. She made the effort to come to you to invite you, so go. -Go and talk to her, seriously. Okay? -Thank you. All right, now go. Go on, shoo. Go. -Hi. -[Cowen] Hey. How are you? -I'm-- I'm good. How are you? -Yeah, I'm good, thank you. -You been busy? -Yeah. What's with the camera? Oh, it's a college project. You don't mind, do you? No, it's fine. It's nice to see you. It's nice to see you, too. -So, Adam and Phil here? -Yes. [Cowen] I think Adam's found his prey for this evening. -[Janine] Oh, no. -Yeah. Janine, listen, um... Do you think I'm a dick? I don't think you're a dick, Cowen. But I think you acted like one. -You didn't call me for six months. -Listen. [clears throat] That night was amazing. And I just felt that... talking about it over something like Facebook or... -Does that make sense? -No, it makes sense. I understand. I didn't feel like I had to hold anything back from you. And you were so sweet. And really understanding. Janine, how long-- how long are you back in town for? About two months. -Yeah? -Yeah. -Okay. Um, let's do something next week. -Really? -Yes. -Like what? Um... -What do you want to do? -Oh, no, no, no, Mr. Director. Um... -I got nothing. -[Janine laughs] Well, I like strawberry picking. -Well, I don't like strawberries. -[laughs] Oh. But I would love to go strawberry picking. Oh, my God, that went so well. [laughs] Oh, man. Okay, well, now, I've had to leave the party quickly because I am in dire need of a piss. -Um... -[thudding] What the fuck? [Cowen] Oh, my God! -[Adam] Seriously. -[Cowen] Adam! Adam! -What? -Fucking Janine's Dad. Janine's-- -Shut up, man. I'm working my magic! -[Cowen] Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Shit! Whoa, whoa, whoa, what the fuck? Fucking hell! -Whoa, whoa! -[Janine] Oh, my God! Somebody! -Somebody call an ambulance! -[woman] Shit! -[Janine] Did you spike her drink? -I didn't do anything! Adam, what did you do? Did you bring drugs to my party? -Trust you to bring drugs! -I didn't do anything! Just get out. Everybody, go home. Just leave! Jesus. [Cowen] Adam! Adam! Why is it always you who fucks things up? -Get that camera out of my face. -[Phil] Adam. Do you know what, Cowen? Cowen, my brother is a lot of things, but he would never drug someone. [Cowen] Look at him. He's a fucking animal! Come on. -[Cowen] Go on! -Seriously, you can't keep blaming me every time you fuck things up with Janine. Look, Cowen, there's nothing to suggest he's done anything. He never gives his drugs away. You know that. [exhales] God, last night was fucked up. It couldn't have been Adam. It just doesn't add up. I need to call Janine. Yeah. Yes. I know you're upset. You have every right-- I know, I know. Janine, listen, I don't-- I don't think it was Adam. No, Janine, listen, please. Please. After I left you, um... I went for a wee in your garden. Janine, I saw your dad. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Hi. -[Cowen] You all right, Phil? -Yeah. You all right? Yeah. [chuckles] [dishes clinking] You sure? -What? -You sure? Are you sure you're all right? Because you don't look it. What's this, then? It's Janine's. Ah. You kept that... how long? -Too long. -Okay. But you don't have to worry about that anymore. Okay. [bowls scraping] So, what happened? Where to begin, Phil? Um... She called me a child. She said I was, um, playing deluded games. And she thinks I'm doing nothing with my life. Oh, Cowen, you didn't believe her, did you? -Well, she's got a point, Phil. -No, she does not have a point, Cowen! That's bollocks. You could do anything you wanted to do. You could. Even if you wanted to leave, you could. You can go. I don't want you to. I... need you, actually. But you have to go. And you need to know that that's okay. Okay. [laughs] Okay. Philippa Martell. What would I do without you? Come here. Come here. Thank you. Oh! Don't be silly. Right, I'm gonna go put the TV on. We're gonna put our feet up and do nothing. -Sounds great. -Yeah? Yeah, sounds good. Okay. [Cowen sighs] [knocking at door] -[Cowen] Phil, what was that? -Oh, it's just the postman. -[glass breaks] -[Phil shouting] [static hissing] What the fuck? Get the fuck off of her! [Cowen choking] [Adam] Fuck off! [Adam] Fuck! [both grunting] [flesh squelching] [Adam panting] Fuck. Fuck. [Phil screaming] [spray can hissing] [postman screaming] [Phil screams] [Cowen] Fuck! [panting] -[Phil whimpering] -[Cowen] Shh! [Kipper] Hey, guys, I brought crumpets. -[Cowen] Right, what do you suggest we do? -Call the police! We can't, okay? We mustn't-- we mustn't do that, Kipper. [Phil] Adam is already on probation. It's the only-- it's the only sensible thing to do. And what happens to Adam, okay? What happens to Adam? We call them, we say it was self-defense. They'll come, clear it up, get rid of it. -Kipper, we are not doing that! -All right, all right! What the fuck do we do? -Put him in the fucking bins? -We could! I mean, come on, no one checks the bins. -Do you realize how bad an idea that is? -What else can we do? Fuck, it's Terry. I am here on a serious matter. You will be aware of the ramifications of the Misuse of Drugs Act. It's illegal to possess cannabis. You all right there, Phil? -Yeah, yeah. -Man, man, listen, listen, listen. She-- she doesn't take to it too well, if know what I mean? Yeah, well, that kind of confirms my suspicion. I have reason to believe there is cannabis on these premises. I was rather hoping I could score some. That's a sizeable amount there, you know? I could have you for supply. -How much do I owe you? -It's on the house. You're a gentleman and a scholar. -Thank you very much. -Thank you. You stay safe, and stay off the skunk, Phil. -[Kipper] Thanks, Terry. -[Cowen] Take it easy, mate. [Cowen] Right, come on. Adam, shift the shit away. [Kipper] Oh, this is a bad idea. Such a bad idea. Guys, we could still call the police. It's not too late. [Cowen] All right, all right, all right. [Kipper] I mean, surely this isn't the best idea you've had? -[Adam] Kipper, just shut up! -[Kipper] Well, it's... -Oh, God. -[Cowen] Right, slowly, slowly, slowly. [Cowen] Holy shit! -Look at this. -[Adam] I've seen his face. -[Cowen] There is a hole in his neck. -[Adam] Let's just get him out of here. [Kipper] That's disgusting. I don't like this. I do not like this at all. [Cowen] Okay, let's... [Cowen grunts] [Kipper] Oh, Jesus. -[Adam] You ready? -[Kipper] No, no, no. [Cowen] Okay, okay. All right. D'ah! -[Adam] Ready, Cowen? -[Cowen] Three, two, one. [Kipper] I still think this is a bad idea. Shut up, Kip! [Cowen] Okay, okay. [Kipper] Hey, guys, this is a really bad idea. We can't do this! -What if someone finds it? -Kip, we're fine, seriously! The lorry pulls up, they tip it in, no one ever looks. -[all grunt] -Oh, God! [Cowen grunting] [Phil] Go, go, quick! Okay, okay. Come on! [Cowen] Adam. Adam. Adam. -[groans] -Adam. Mate, mate. [exhales] Seriously? Yes. Mate, mate, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. -Mate. -What? What? What? I've been awake all night. I need your help with something. -Cowen, can I just sleep, please? -No. This is gonna sound fucking crazy, all right? So... just... That guy yesterday... Look, he-- he didn't seem to... I don't want to talk about it, Cowen. I don't want to talk about it, please. When you stabbed him, it didn't seem to do anything. It's just adrenaline. But when you sprayed him with that deodorant, it killed him, Adam. It's just-- just a reaction. Just let me sleep. -Don't be fucking stupid! -I don't wanna talk about it! Did you see the hole in the back of his neck? -There wasn't any hole! -Of course-- right. You need to come down to the bins with me. -Come to the bins. -Are you mad? Are you mad, Cowen? You want us to go out there and look at a body that we killed? What if we get caught? Please. Adam, please. I'm fucking begging you right now. [sighs] Adam. You're fucking mad. Fine, fine! Fuck. -You sure you wanna look at it? -Yes! [flies buzzing] [Adam] So what am I looking at? [Cowen] Check his neck. -[Adam] So it's a cut. -Mate! What done that? [Adam] Glass? [Adam] What else do you think? [Cowen] Oh... I don't know, but, listen, I'm telling-- -It's your imagination. -Fuck off. -What else do you think did that? -Adam, look at that wound! [Adam] I've seen plenty of cuts, and that, to me, is a cut. [Cowen] What the fuck? [Adam] Seriously, mate, you live in a dream world. So, let me get this straight. You want me to spray some random person in the face with this just to see what it does? This is our only option, okay? Do you know how you sound? There's a body in that bin. We put that there and you want me to run around spraying people? What if they go fucking blind? I'm not doing this! Fuck! Are you out of your-- ahh! Come on, Cowen, it's been over half an hour now. Mate, I know. But, Adam, you've got to trust me, all right? -[groans] -Please, man. [Cowen] Adam, him. I've seen him before. -Seriously? Are you sure? -Yes, him. Yes! [Adam] Sorry, mate, have you got the time? -[grunts] -[static hissing] -[Adam] Shit! Prick! -[Cowen] Adam! Adam, wait! -Adam! -Come on! [distorted] Cowen, keep up! [Cowen panting] [distorted] Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. -[Adam] After him! -[Cowen] Adam, it's the old factory. Why's he going in there? -Come on! -Go, go. [panting] -The prick's gone in there. -Oh, shit. [Cowen] What the fuck? I thought it was abandoned. [Adam] So did I. -Looks like a smackhead gathering. -No shit. -I'm gonna take a look round back. -What the fuck? -Mate, I need to know what's going on. -Adam. It'll be fun. I've got this. Cowen, I've got this. It's fine! -What the fuck are you doing? -Come on. -[people growling] -[Cowen] Oh, fuck! Oh, shit! [panting] -[normal audio] Cowen? -[Cowen] Look at this. [Phil] Whoa, shit. Cowen, are you all right? -Yeah, yeah. -Are you okay? Are you hurt? Cowen! I'm all right. I'm all right. -What's going on? -Give me a sec. -Cowen, what's happening? -Kip, help me up. I'm fine. -We followed some guy this morning. -Who? -Me and Adam. -Where is Adam? -We went to the old factory. -Wait, where's Adam? -I thought it was abandoned. -So did I. -What is going on? -Where is Adam? I don't know. He ran off. He ran off, Phil. [door opens, closes] -[Cowen] Adam, you bastard! -[Phil] Adam? -[Cowen] Are you all right? -[Phil] Adam. -[Adam shouts] -[Kipper] Adam, Adam, get off him! -Phil, help me! -[Adam shouting] -[spray can hissing] -[Adam screaming] [creature screeches] [screeching] -[squelches, crunches] -[creature shrieks] [Phil] What the fuck is that? [Kipper] It's got to work like some kind of chameleon. That's how come we couldn't see it. [Cowen] Kipper, that is no fucking chameleon. From now on, we film everything. Oh, Jesus. [sobbing] It spoke to me. Told me to kill you. And I couldn't do anything. Nothing. I don't fucking care what it is. But I know what fucking kills it. -Oh... -[Phil] Two seconds. Ah, that stings. -[Phil] You okay? -No, I'm fine. [exhales] But what do we do now? I've just been checking all the news sites. There's nothing on any of them. This is a completely new thing. We have to tell someone. We've got to get the fuck out of here and then tell someone. [Cowen] Guys, I need to go get Janine. What? Cowen, we've got to get the fuck out of here. Cowen, it's dangerous. You saw what that thing did to Adam. -[Phil] Yes, exactly. Adam? -[Adam] I'm with Cowen. [Phil] You don't even like her. [Adam] That was before I had that on my head. -[Phil] You've got to be kidding! -Phil, Phil. -This is nuts. -This is the only thing that matters. If Cowen wants Janine to be a part of it, then I'm with him. No, you're crazy. [Cowen] Wait. Guys, guys, listen. Let's just go over the facts, all right? We know once we spray the fuckers with the deodorant, they come off and we can kill them. -Right? -Right. -[Cowen] So, we just need more deodorant. -Yeah. What are you talking about? You can't actually do that in real life, Cowen. -Cowen, are you sure you wanna do this? -Yes. So, we want to do this? [Cowen] Guys, listen, listen. You don't have to help me. Yeah... we do. -[lock clicks] -[Adam grunts] -[Phil] Huh. -[Adam laughs] -[Phil] Oh, God, this is so weird. -[Adam] Wow. -[Adam] Guys, check it out. -[Phil] It's really creepy at night. -[loud clatter] -[Adam laughs] [Cowen] Adam, what the fuck are you doing? -What are you doing? -You should get flowers for Janine. Come on. -[Phil] Hey, guys, look. -[Adam gasps] Test it. Test it. -[P.A. chimes] -[Cowen] Guys! [Kipper] I work here. If I get sacked because of you, I'm not gonna be happy. He's such a bore. -Don't forget why we're here. -[Adam] Yeah, yeah. -For fuck's sake. -[Phil] No. [distant clanging] -[Phil] We need to go. -No. -[creatures squeaking] -[Cowen] Fuck, fuck. Guys, get in, get in. -[Adam] What is it? What is it? -[Cowen] There's someone down there. -Oh, shit! -[Phil] Oh, fuck! -What do we do? -[Kipper] Go down, next aisle. -[Adam] Phil. -[Phil] No. [Adam] Oh... -We need to get out of here right now. -[Kipper] That'd be great. I don't know if we can do this. We can't. We need that deodorant, Phil. -[Kipper] It's dangerous. -Yeah, we need it. Shh! [Adam] This isn't a good idea, man. -[Cowen] Mate, we need that-- -[bottles clinking] [Adam] Ah, fuck it! -[Cowen grunts] -[creature screeching] [Phil screams] -[creatures hissing] -[Phil screaming] -[Cowen] Guys, we need to go. -[man screeching] [Phil screams] Oh, my God! [creature screeching] [Phil] Go! Go! [Cowen] Go! The exit! Go right! Go right, Kipper, come on! [creature screeching] Oh, my God. Did you see that? This was easy! We've got this! That was not easy, Adam! With those crazy people attacking us. And you, you can't do that to people, Adam! [Kipper] Exactly. You can't do that. It's irresponsible. -Guys, guys, come on! -[Kipper] It's dangerous! Take a breath. Adam, weapons. We need weapons, all right? -The garden shed. Go. -I've got it. -Sweetie, are you all right? -No. No, I'm not. Yes. I need you to do something for me. Count how many cans of deodorant we've got. -Okay? -All right. Yup, okay. Kipper, talk to me. [Kipper] They were organized. You saw that, right? I saw. I saw. How did they even get in? What if there's more of them? Okay. Um... Janine's. We need to think back alleys, garages, the safest, most efficient way of getting there. -All right? -[Kipper] I can do that, I've got it. -[Cowen] Nice, nice. -[Phil] We've got 15, 15. [Cowen] Guys, take one and spray yourself. -[spray can hissing] -[Kipper] Cheers. Guys, is this actually gonna do anything?

My dad is dead because we killed him! Cowen, we killed him! Cowen. I need to get us out of here. So, what's your plan? We need a-- a car or something. I've got the keys to my dad's car. I've got the keys to my dad's car in my bag. The car's parked at the council offices. It's the front left pocket. -Okay. -Yeah. I'm gonna go downstairs and talk to the others. -Okay? -Yeah, yeah. [Cowen] Anything? It's all quiet out back. There's nothing there at all. Kip, listen. We've got a car. -Okay. -Janine's dad's car. -But one of us needs to go get it. -All right, cool. Where is it?

I'm gonna go and get the car. I know you guys would tell me not to, that it's too dangerous, that I'd mess up and end up getting hurt, put you all in danger, like I did today. That's exactly why I'm going. I need to repay you guys for saving my life. I can do this. [Cowen] Adam, wait! -Wait. -Fuck off! I've gotta get my sister! -Fuck. Fuck. -Adam. -Phil! -Adam! [sobbing] Fuck! Fuck, this is my fault, man. Fuck. -Fucking... -[Cowen] Adam, listen. I know, I know. It's all right, it's all right. Look at me!

We have to get back to the flat, okay? -[Cowen] No, they took her. -Adam and Janine. They're both there and they're waiting for us. We know where they are. We don't know where they've taken Phil.

We're a family, Cowen. Cowen, we have to do this, and it doesn't matter what happens. Even... Even if it kills us. Could you live with yourself if you didn't even try? [sighs] I need you, man. They need us. They need us. Okay. Fourteen... Fifteen. All right. Nice. Kip, help me with that. [camera beeps] [snapping fingers] -What's it like out there? -It's abandoned. All right.

[Cowen] Phil, if you're out there...
