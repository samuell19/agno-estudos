>> Be seated gentlemen. >> The reason I've called this meeting is I've just had one with my advisors, and we have a problem. All activity on VR Cloak is to be terminated immediately. >> You can't stop now, we're at the final phase. >> Come on, MacIntyre. >> MacIntyre. >> That's right, MacIntyre. >> You wouldn't be related to a Colonel MacIntyre? >> He was my father, sir. >> Sorry about your father, son. >> Bullshit, you people set him up. >> Come on Vincent, it's okay. >> As I was saying gentlemen the project is terminated, as of now. >> Yeah, what's the reason for this commander? >> No what is the excuse? >> The results according to these reports are very disturbing. Several people have been hurt. I have a soldier with the mind of a vegetable. The system is unsafe. >> But together we have spent millions funding this project. We really must appeal the decision. >> We're at the end the final phase is almost complete and the system is completely safe. Now, I don't know what you people are doing wrong. >> Gentlemen, that is all. Debriefing will be at 0900 tomorrow, thank you. [dramatic music] >> I won't be late. >> That's what you always say. >> Don't you think you should get some rest. >> No I have to finish this tonight. They are expecting it for the international net conference in the morning. >> Don't work to hard Sharon. I'll be back soon. >> I'll be here. >> Bye.>> Bye sweetheart. [dramatic music] >> Daddy is a whacko! >> Well the way you're going Vincent you're going to end up just like your father, a murderer. >> You're a MacIntyre. You and your families evil genius left them all dead. >> The system is unsafe. Activity on VR Cloak is now been terminated. >> With your family reputation, we can't afford to keep you both anymore. >> This time they'll pay. [phone ringing] >> Dagastino here. >> We got a deal. >> That's my boy. >> I'm not going to tell you anymore till the end of the story. The caesar salad, excuse me, I'm talking here, thank you. >> Ohh!>> All Europe too. Oh what?>> Mine doesn't treat me like that, he's much better. >> And that's why your man is sitting there and I'm sitting here. Something you should remember. >> Excuse me a minute. [dramatic music] [people chatting] [tinging of metal] >> My guests. I trust your meal was satisfactory for the finest of desserts is yet to be served. Unfortunately, there's a price for such decadence and I do not refer to your waistline. [laughing] Ladies, perhaps this would be an opportune time for you to make that trek to the facilities to freshen up, as they say. >> Must I miss the big surprise? >> We all have our weaknesses gentlemen. Unfortunately nothing in this life is free so I shall trust that you have all have come prepared. Excellent! [telephone ringing] >> Yes! >> Fifty crates such as these are up for the bidding and I do believe my reputation as a generous host shall remain intact. [dramatic music] Now have I any suggestions for an opening bid? >> Honey, let's not waste anymore of these gentlemen's precious time. >> Please. This is man's business. >> Not quite, this is, police business... ...and I'll finish tonight's bidding at twenty five years inside. Hey, let's keep those hands where we can see them boys. I wouldn't want to mess up Mr. Dagastino's's pretty jacket he looks so damn good tonight. [women talking on phone] [gun firing]>> Hello, hello. >> On the contrary, it is you who should be concerned about future appearances. >> Hello. >> Hello boys. [gun firing] >> Take Detective Carrie McCarthy out to the pier and dispose of her. >> Uhh! [gun firing] >> Ooh! >> Ooh! [automatic weapon firing] >> Uhh! >> Ooh! >> Aah! >> Drop it! >> Uhh! >> Thanks partner. [dramatic music] >> Noo![gun firing] >> Aah![gun firing] >> Stop. You won't get away this time. [gun firing] [tires screeching] [gun firing] >> Aah! Oh great! >> Just do it now. [rocket launcher firing]>> Whoa! [tires screeching] >> One too many mistakes Leon. [gun firing] [sirens wailing] [somber music] >> Sorry sir, you're not really supposed to be in here. >> I know. >> Blake, they're not sure if your partner's going to make it. >> I know. >> Aah she'll be all right. But you're going to need some help. So I've assigned your old buddy Stone to work with you. >> Could have done worse. >> Now how about a little something for Captain Ramirez. Something like an explanation for all this. >> What about seven dead bad guys, a couple hundred hot guns off the street. >> I'm thinking more along the lines of gifts to tonight's host. More money than the federal reserve. >> Guns, prostitution, and numbers. >> Right, then there's these. Something to please the ladies. >> Smuggled out of South Africa, no doubt. >> And of course everybody's favorite. Now what's all this add up to? >> Money, hot gems, drugs, these guys were connected. That's why Dagastino had them here. >> Excellent, Detective. Except for our mystery briefcase. Dagastino's the biggest crime lord in this town. But he's no computer genius. >> Let's talk to someone who is. >> For future references detectives, computer disks do not enjoy having holes blasted in them. >> Neither did the guy that was carrying it. >> Can you get anything off of it? >> Just pieces actually. To tell you whoever wrote this thing is really good, weapons select... >> Military issue? >> Weapons design? >> Stats are in here... ...Games! >> Huh? >> It's advanced, complex, it's nothing like I've ever seen before but definitely some sort of game... >> Well it narrows it down to a few thousand choices. >> Level four "Dismember Dungeon", level nine "Electro-fry" >> Could you put together a list of computer software designer geeks that would be capable of doing this kind of work. Where we can cross reference it. >> Yup..."Electro-fry" >> Are we boring you with something? >> Yeah, you're sure? Thanks...I will. Bye. The name of the game is "Expect to Die" it's manufactured by "CI Industries". >> If we don't move on this now the lieutenant is going to get pissed. >> Carrie's more important. >> I understand that, anything you want me to do? >> Meet me at Conquest Industry later. >> Blake, your okay with this? You and me again. >> Just don't get yourself shot. [car engine starting]>> Okay. [upbeat music] [upbeat music] >> Hi, what are you having? >> Just a water. >> Hi there. You look like you could use some company. Buy a lady a drink? Come on, be a prince. >> You're not my princess. >> It's your loss. >> I's no surprise that Professor MacIntyre had little to say when asked about what happened. Doctor MacIntyre did the military experiment with your VR program? >> Hey you, you're that guy on TV right? >>... your father creating something evil enough to kill your country's own men. >> Your that virtual reality guy. That stuff is real than real. I'm talking to you. >> What? >> Those soldiers got hurt. All that shit that they poured down on us. Hey those were our people, those were our guys. >> So!>> Yeah, now you're the new generation. >> You know, you really don't know what you're talking about. And you really shouldn't believe everything you hear. Get lost! >> You get lost! >> Hey, hold it right there. Enough!>> He started it. >> Think your a tough guy. >> You're out of here, right now. Get out of here man and don't bother to come back. [dramatic music] >> Yah! Yah! Yah! Yah! Yah! >> Oh yes! Now we'll see who's in charge. We'll show them who's the boss. [growling] >> Hey! Catch any bad guys today? >> Not really. >> What is it Justin? >> Carrie! >> I don't know if she's going to make it. >> Oh honey. Come with me. Everything will be okay. [machine beeping] >> Uhh! Wasn't so bad was it? Better than those guys. [soft music] [loud upbeat music] >> Get out of here. >> Hello Jake. [dart gun firing] You're going to be a great soldier Jake. Let there be life. [dramatic music] >> What the hell is this? >> Do not attempt to remove the monitoring harness. If removed you're terminated. And that means dead. >> Dead, you're the one who's going to die if you don't get this stuff off me. >> Silence, Game Player! This is an introductory level. Defeat the jailkeeper, or "Expect to Die". >> Come on if you don't let me out of here you're going to be sorry. >> Yah!>> What the hell! [grunting] >> You certainly picked a very popular game. >> Is that right? >> Uh-hmm! "Expect to Die" Starring the most wicked of all bad guys Killal. >> I'm scared. >> You'll love this. You have to destroy these assassins to get a key from a chamber and each chamber gets you closer to freeing the princess. >> Princess! >> However, before you can reach the princess you've got to destroy this bad ass here. >> Aargh! >> Killal. >> No problem. >> It's not easy, in order to move up a level Killal's got to whack a guy's head off. >> Clean through. >> Yah! >> Game player. >> Game over. >> Yah! Yah!>> Noo! >> What do you know about Conquest Industries? >> Based on our competitors and games market for years No, we've been their competitors, they're number one. Their stuff is unbelievable. And games are not the only thing they do. >> Really. >> Okay I'm going to show you. I had Jane send over a copy of her software sold to the public. >> What do you mean available to the public >> What I mean is, their stuff is the top secret. >> That's interesting. >> They're on the cutting edge of modern technology. That's worth millions. Uh-uh billions of dollars. >> I see. >> That's definitely one of ours. But like I told you before I had nothing to do with the actual creation of the games. That's left to the computer monkeys downstairs. >> Surely, the boss wants to know what goes on below him. I mean, this is one of your most successful games ever. >> Correct, that's exactly why we're in the final development stages of a revolutionary sequel starring our good friend Killal. >> Maybe we could talk to this program designer. >> Well you can talk to him all day long as far as I'm concerned, assuming you can find him. >> If you could just direct us to his lab. >> I have no idea where Dr. Vincent MacIntyre is. We were unfortunately left with very few options but to release him. >> Really. >> Unauthorized research. And that's not exactly where I want my company headed. This is an extremely competitive industry and should my programming particulars become public, that moves away shareholders. >> So competitive that your gaming programs could be used as currency among certain members of the organized crime families. Like I told you two officers... >> Detectives. ...my mistake... As I mentioned before, I'm at a loss as to how a common hoodlum could get hold of such a set of disks. That's all, I have a full schedule. >> Do you miss it? >> My athletic endeavors, certainly became a marketable commodity when I entered the upper echelons of the business arena. >> Thanks for your time. >> Well, what do you think of that guy? >> I think he's a prick and he's hiding something. >> So let's go back in and squeeze him a little bit. >> I vote we find out who was supplying the weapons from our dinner party. >> Well, if I was a connected bad guy who would I go to buy some stolen weapons, Quan. >> You got it Quan! >> Well you're driving. >> I knew you're going to like that. >> The interruptions haven't been at my doing, the cops were in my office today. I mean I cannot afford to be exposed to this type of scrutiny I have a reputation to uphold. Are you listening to me? Hey, are you listening to me Dagastino? >> It's Mr. Dagastino. You don't have to raise your voice. >> You're of course correct. I'm just simply trying to remind you of our agreement. >> You don't have to remind me of anything. You are a greedy little man who is not satisfied with his six figure salary. Now to have a chance at the millions you must be prepared. >> Yeah, but there's police involved here. >> You will continue to supply us with the raw materials we require. The police are but an inconvenience. And your distance from this project will ensure that they are kept at arm's length as per our agreement. >> And they're in my office today asking me questions and that's not part of our agreement.>> Will you listen to me. >> You're quite right. And this is precisely the reason I was let go from Conquest Industries. >> Correct. There's no need to bring undue attention to the corporation. >> Jim you were right in bringing this to our attention. Mr. Dagastino, I'll take care of it. >> Thank you. I knew we could work something out gentlemen. Vincent. Mr. Dagastino.>> I'll walk you out. >> Good night. >> You realize of course he's getting very close to giving us up. >> Please, after today's delivery Tanner's going to complete the hardware end of the bargain. >> So that's it. >> No, no! I do believe Mr. Jim Tanner's going to provide us with one more last contribution. >> You know, I think he's right about the cops getting to close. >> Don't worry, everything will be taken care of in due course. >> I think we should dispose of our curious detectives. >> No, we need them for the final phase. >> But they're cops. >> They're mine. >> All right, professor, anything to keep you happy. >> I guess Quan's working over time. >> Let's crash this party. [warning light beeping] >> Punctual as usual. >> Of course. >> Should I call for some back up. >> Uh, absolutely, but I don't think the boys will wait. I'll take the truck. >> Ooh, bad guys beware. >> Good guys are here. [dramatic music] >> License and registration please. Come on. >> Work like old women, move faster. >> Quan, take it easy on the guys. How about everybody takes five. >> What the heck's the problem now? >> Easy there big fella. And you, you watch your mouth. >> That's no good, you've got no probable cause. >> Probable cause. Do you see me arresting anyone? >> We went by your stand you weren't there we got a little worried about you. Thought we'd come back, and make sure you're okay. >> Sorry Quan. I just was standing here and the box went boom. Now that's what I call probable cause. Dagastino ain't going to like this Quan. >> The truck. [automatic weapon firing] [guns firing] [truck engine starting] >> Hold that truck. [gun firing]>> Uhh! [dramatic music] [automatic weapon firing] [guns firing] >> We got him. [guns firing]>> Uhh, uhh! >> Uhh! >> Uhh! >> Uhh! >> Uhh! >> How does it look from up there? >> All's clear. Except for one piece of lying fruit and vegetable selling trash. >> Can I shoot him? >> No, no, Quan staying, don't shoot, Quan stay. >> Quan stay and answer questions right? Guess what else we found? >> I never see that before. >> Quan I'm tired of your games. Maybe I should let Stone come and talk to you. >> No, no please, Quan talk. >> All right, then explain this? Hi-tech isn't your normal shopping lists or maybe you're expanding Quan? >> No, no. Quan just a middle man. >> What do you know about CI Industries and Tanner? >> I don't know CI, Tanner. Dagastino in charge, not Quan. >> You know I want Dagastino more than anything, but right now Tanner is number one on my list. You're going to help me right? Right? You made the right choice Quan. >> Great, this is just great, now I got a mess to clean up in Chinatown. You're typing away like an eight dollar an hour temp. Do you have any idea what these delays are costing me? >> Mr. Dagastino, do you realize what we're doing here? Do you realize what kind of a breakthrough we're on the verge of. >> Yeah, yeah, well I've heard this before somewhere haven't I? But we do have some very wealthy very anxious clients overseas. And they are not willing to wait round for you and your diddling they want their product and they want it now. >> By the time I'm finished with this program and we go online worldwide you and your clients will have so much money you won't be able to find a bank vault big enough for it. So relax. And if you want this to go quicker leave this stuff alone, get out of here let me do my job. >> Okay you stick to your end professor, I'll stick to mine. >> Good morning honey. >> Good morning. It says here, sunny skies ahead and something about two very brave local cops. >> Well, well. >> Well Detective, you better be more careful from here on out, because we are going to be depending on you. >> What do you mean, we? >> I mean, we. >> No!>> Oh yes! I love you.>> I love you too. [dramatic music] >> Fine, I get it. I am not going to be the one hung out to dry on this. Vince, what do you.. uhh! [dramatic music] >> Arise, game player. >> Vincent, what kind of sick joke is this? >> Silence! >> Where are you Vincent Goddamn it, can you hear me? Answer me. >> We're going to bring your contributions to Killal's programming to an all time sacred level. However at this time I'm afraid there will be no unlimited gold. >> But it's not Davis' doing just tell me what you want I'll get you what you want. >> Your reaction time to the marksman is crucial to the program. And to your survival. >> Vincent this is crazy I'm sure we can work something out here. >> 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. >> You're a psycho! >> Expect to Die! >> What's up? [dramatic music] >> Listen Vince, this is crazy. I'm sure we can work this out. >> Killal hears nothing, game player. [dramatic music] >> Vince, Vince, stop man, I'm... >> Yah!>> Whoa! >> Yah! [machine beeping] >> Finally! Damn, I found it. The gaming division of Conquest Industries has overtaken all of its competitors, simply because of it's advanced programs. >> Are they really that good? >> Not only are the gamesman in it hard to beat but the characters move just like real people. >> Can you find out more about this new Killal game? >> I don't know, it's really hush hush. Everybody's buzzing about it though. They're really going to make a fortune. They're just waiting for some touches on Killal. >> I have a feeling they'll be waiting a little longer. I just wish I could get into their lab. >> I thought you went over there. >> Yeah but Mr. Tanner was not exactly cooperative. >> Well, maybe I can help. Jerry Martin works in the research and development. I could easily be able to set up an appointment. >> Look Detective, I can't help you. Any information has to go through Dr. Tanner. >> Well Mr. Tanner is not here right now. According to personnel files you're the number one programer. So you're going to give us a hand, right? >> But that is impossible I can't even access confidential data. Dr. Vincent MacIntyre's the only one who can log on to a secure channel. And since Vince's been gone the only activity on file has been coming in from an outside source. >> Come on your stringing us along. High tech place like this and somebody's tapping in from outside. >> Not somebody, it's an Alpha-1 clearance. Now Mr. Tanner is the only one with an Alpha-1 clearance. So the research must be being done off site. >> Off site, with a bright boy like you. Come on. >> You have to understand this place is hot hard wired any computer terminal can access by an Alpha-1 clearance. I only input data. >> Look Blake, Jerry here is pretty much a moron. Because I know if he had some information he'd tell us. Because once we've run down the serial numbers on that stolen equipment and it matches the equipment issued to this department. our good pal Jerry here becomes suspect number one. >> What, I had nothing to do with the Killal program. >> Who said anything about Killal. Only us cops and the bad guys knew what programs were found. Now since, I didn't see a badge on you, so that makes you... >> Oh what, a bad guy? Wait, wait, wait, wait, okay, okay. What do you want to know? >> Where's Tanner hiding and what's with all the disappearing equipment? >> Ever since Dr. MacIntyre was let go all sorts of stuff has come up missing. >> So why'd they can the genius anyway? >> A while ago, MacIntyre developed this new program. It takes gaming information and turns it into direct sensory feedback. >> And they fired him for building a better game. >> No, it wasn't that. Think player crossed over. Here I'll show you. [machine buzzing] >> Rescue instrument VR machine. I'd like to give it a shot. >> All right now Detective, you'll begin on Level 1. >> Level 1 of what? >> Oh sorry, Detective Stone has chosen a program called "Basic Training". >> Oh we could change that to 'Mr Bumpy's trip to the zoo" if you'd like. >> Very funny guys, very funny. >> Just one more thing Detective, the program does not allow for interruptions. >> What does that mean? >> Well, let's say your task at hand is to jog up a flight of stairs stop until you reach the very top. >> Okay, okay, I got it, I got it. No unfinished business. >> Initiating Level 1, "Basic Training" >> Wow, that's quite an outfit, thank you. Jerry this is good. >> You're late maggot. Basic training starts at 0600 hours. >> What do you mean, I'm late? >> 0600 is 0600. Not one second before and not one second after. Now make that fifty maggot because I don't like explaining myself. >> Okay, okay, whatever you want we'll play your game. >> What do you want, knuckle push ups? >> Yes! >> Could I do jumping knuckle push ups? For you only. >> Keep on going maggot. >> This guy's great. I hope he doesn't comply. >> Well, each character in this program actually any of the programs is fitted with an option sequence the player can decide on his direction. >> Did you enjoy that maggot? >> Come on why don't you relax man. >> Man, do I look like some dope smokin, tie-dye wearin', hippie freak. I am not your man. I am that guy who may or may not be able to mold you into a lethal fighting machine, you got it. >> What's next for this lethal fighting machine? >> Okay tough guy, let's skip the preliminaries and move on to the challenge. Make it to the top, move on, got it tough guy. >> Good, a rope climb. >> Ready, move. >> What if he loses? >> Not much. Sergeant chews him out, game over. >> Move maggot, move. >> And if he wins? >> Oh that depends, game over, new level, some competition. >> I'm on top, what now? >> Well private, I guess this game's much of a test for a tough guy like you though. You got choices to make mister. >> Here they come, the options. >> Lieutenant, Major, whoa General. What's this one? Commander Blake. I like that. >> Shit! >> What? >> Your partner just jumped up eight levels. >> Hello, hello. >> This is the drill sergeant. >> Yah! >> Holy, you the heck are you? >> Aah! >> This guy has great reflexes. >> Looks like he's going to need 'em. >> Hey guys, who's this? >> Yah! >> Hey!>> Yah! >> Okay, okay, it's enough, I got the idea. >> Yah! >> Blake! Blake! You shut this thing down little man. >> Uhh, uhh, uhh! [telephone ringing] >> Hello. Yes, just a minute, it's for you. >> Blake here.>> Hey Blake. How the hell are you? Listen, the lieutenant wants to see us and he sounds pretty pissed. >> Don't worry about him. No, when we crack this case wide open he's going to get honourable mention he's going to be a very happy man. >> All right, cool listen, I'll meet you over at the station. >> Okay, I'll see you in his office. I love you. Oh honey, you okay? I'll be back soon.>> So long. >> The DA is under pressure from a Conquest Industries lawyer to free for your little VR programming pal. What are you holding Jerry on? >> That guys game could have killed my partner lieutenant. >> Well that's enough game playing. >> Fine. I have a team from CIC analyzing the data let's see what they come up with. In the meantime the whole legal computer parts has been shut down. But there's more than this, there's a hell of a lot more than this than just the flow of data. There's no way in hell that, that stuff is flowing out of the backdoor of that place without Tanner knowing about it first. >> Unfortunately Tanner won't be giving us any answers. They found him floating down by the dock yesterday. >> Yesterday? He's a principle suspect in our investigation. How come we're only finding out now? >> They found him yesterday but they only ID'd him two hours ago. Someone relieved him of his head. >> Couldn't have happened to a nicer guy. Let me guess, decapitation courtesy of an axe. >> Yes, forensics said it was a sharp axe, wielded with incredible force. >> Killal's trophy.>> Maybe! >> I mean this video game is for real. >> Not the video game, the sequel. >> The sequel? >> Bigger and better. >> More realistic too. >> Is there any chance this Jerry guy could be playing both of you. >> Maybe he is, MacIntyre's the guy we want. >> Dagastino and Vincent MacIntyre. >> Dagastino's the wild card here. Him and his boys they have illegal stuff flowing out of their place into the underground market. >> So if it ever comes back to CI, Tanner pleads ignorance, plays the victim of theft and nobody looks any further. >> Well Tanner's out. >> I'll take care of Jerry you go to CI, speak to whoever's left there we should find out where Vince MacIntyre is. >> Go!>> Go! >> Yeah! >> Dagastino, its Jerry Martin. >> What's wrong this time? >> Agent Blake, he's been drilling me again. I didn't spill a thing. but listen Stone's going over to CI to pick up some dirt. And there's still some of Vince's files on my system. I thought you'd want to know, got to run. >> These detectives are getting overly curious. Have the others take care of Blake you guys nab Stone, he's heading for CI right now. >> It's done Sir. >> I told Sharon you're coming for dinner tonight and I won't take no for an answer. >> No it's okay really. >> Don't get me in trouble with the wife. You remember my address? >> Of course I remember your address. >> We got Blake. >> Copy, we'll take Stone. [dramatic music] >> Hi honey, yeah Stone accepted the invitation. Stone will bring some wine. Don't worry, he always does. Is there anything else you want? Sure, I'll stop at the store. >> Stone's coming up right now. Let's go. [dramatic music] >> It's all set honey. Okay, see you soon. [dramatic music] >> We're nearing Point B. >> We're ready here. [dramatic music] [tires screeching] >> Blake stopped at a fruit stand, what now? >> Wait until he comes out, stand down. [dramatic music] >> Officer needs assistance, officer needs assistance. This is Detective Stone requesting backup on Main and Fifth. >> Hold it right there. >> You gentlemen have a problem? >> You're the one with the problem, sport. >> You're coming with us. >> You do know I'm a police officer. >> That's why you're coming with us. >> Remember boys, boss wants us to keep him alive. >> Uhh! >> Let's go! [dramatic music] >> Don't move Blake. >> Huh! >> Aah! >> Blake, give me the gun. >> Ayy, yah! >> Right there. >> Aah! >> Aah! >> Not so fast. >> Look I'm a cop you don't want to kill a cop. I'm going to get in my car, I'm going to drive away, that's it. Come on, put the gun down, you don't want to shoot a cop. [gun firing] Aah! [sirens wailing] >> Repeat shots fired at Main and Fifth. All units in area respond, over. Detective Blake, Detective Blake do you copy, over? >> Yeah, this is Detective Blake. >> Stone's been shot. [sirens wailing] Blake do you hear me? >> Copy! >> So how much longer are we going to have to babysit this whacko? >> Don't worry about it. We'll take care of him when the time is right. [suspenseful music] >> Hey genius, they just arrested that programming geek of yours again. It's time we shut this thing down. >> Don't you have any interest in the future Mr. Dagastino? >> The future, the only thing about the future that interests me right now is staying out of jail. >> There's no need to be concerned. What did they arrest Jerry for? Knowing me, watching the genius at work. I don't think so. >> Look you're boy's in custody. If he talks, we are in big trouble. >> Two things. One he's not my boy. And two, he's got nothing to talk about. All of our contact was minimal it was all untraceable online and there's no need to be concerned. They're still sending off those cops. >> Oh now you promised me that I could use them for my experiment. >> My boys are taking care of that right now, but I still say they die. >> They will, they will. [machine whirring] [gun firing] Haha, haha, bravo! No need to be alarmed. Nothing to lose your head over. Just stay right there. [gun firing]>> Huh! What the... >> Everything will be taken care of. >> Where's Mr. Dagastino? >> Where's the cop? >> What's the matter professor you don't hear so good? I said, where's Mr. Dagastino? >> And I said, where is the cop? I want him here now. >> Look professor, let's get one thing straight, I work for Mr. Dagastino, not you. Now where is he? >> He's taking a leak. Now tell me what happened to the policeman. >> He didn't make it. >> What do you mean he didn't make it? >> I had to shoot him. >> You shot him? You shot him with what a gun?>> Yeah! >> Which gun? >> This gun. >> This gun. >> This gun.>> Yeah. [gun firing] >> I hate guns. [suspenseful music] >> Sharon, Sharon! Are you downstairs? Honey I've got some bad news. [laughing] >> Not so fast. >> Wait! >> We're all doing fine here now let's all keep our cool or my partner here plays doctor with your tasty wife. All right, you're coming with us Mrs. Blake, come on.>> All right, get away from me. >> If you harm her. >> She's fine. >> Enter the captive princess. Game player, your time has come. >> If you hurt her, you'll regret it Vincent. >> Exceptional competition is the hallmark of levels 4 and 5. Levels 1 through 3 have been mastered. you shall provide the trophies for levels 4 and 5. >> I like my trophy right where it is, between my shoulders. >> Silence game player. Verbal contact is only allowed with the imprisoned princess. >> Sharon. >> Justin. Where are you? >> Somewhere inside Vincent's twisted mind. >> I had a feeling that we're playing Expect to Die for real. >> No I'm the princess endure the warlords pain. >> Don't worry honey, I'll get you somehow. >> The imprisoned princess will be your guide at your request. >> Maybe I don't want to play. >> Then both the game player and the princess will be terminated. >> The only one who's going to be terminated is you Vince. >> Game player, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 "Expect to Die". >> No, Justin. >> Is this supposed to keep me here? >> I'm trapped too, and I don't think I like it. >> Well honey, this virtual tank seems quite real to me.
