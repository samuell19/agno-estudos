The End On March 10, 1925, Hugo Bettauer, author of the novel "The city without Jews", was shot by the National Socialist Otto Rothstock and dies several days later because of his injuries. Rohstock, having been "completely deprived of the use of reason", despite having been unanimously convicted of murder, was acquitted and entered a sanitarium. On May 28, 1927 he was released from the psychiatric center by judicial decision, without further conditions.
