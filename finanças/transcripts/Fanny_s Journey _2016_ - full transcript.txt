The mail's here, kids! Alice! Alfred. Odette. Nathanaël. You'll like it here. You'll make lots of friends. I'll come for you soon. Understand? Agathe. Robert. Camille. Jeanne. During World War II, many Jewish parents in France entrusted their children to various organizations, which took them in and sheltered them from the threat. Bring that to Emile. Fanny! FANNY'S JOURNEY Based on a true story... "Fanny, sweetheart, Your father's still in the Vernet Camp. He's fine. I had to leave our apartment. Write me in care of Aunt Rose. How are you and your sisters? Are you eating enough? You must have grown in 2 years. I miss you so much! I hug you with all my heart. Your mommy, who loves you all. Hi, Mom. Yes, we're all fine. We can't leave the grounds, now that the Germans are here. We eat well, too. eggs, milk and the cabbages we grow." 24, 25, 42, 38, 50! "Georgette can count to 25. -And Erika..." -Fanny, where are you? "...isn't clingy at all. Thank you for the shoes. I'm enclosing one of Georgette's drawings. It's you and Daddy. We send all our love and can't wait to see you again." Okay, girls, bedtime! Good night! Sweet dreams! Good night! See you tomorrow! If you kick me, it's back to your bed! Okay. Will you tell me a story? Not now. Go to sleep! And stop clinging. That's a mean dog. I'm a mean dog! And you? What's your name? Georgette? Georgette! I'm Georgette! -Are you afraid of wolves? -No. Do you know any princesses? Mommy, look at the camera! Okay, girls, give me a big smile! Fanny, you wanna take one? June 23, 1943 La Fontaine's Fables What makes you so bold as to meddle with my drinking? Sire, may Your Majesty not put himself into such a rage. But rather, let him consider that I am taking a drink from the stream more than 20 steps below him. And therefore, in no way, am I disturbing his supply. You are disturbing it. And I know you spoke ill of me last year. How could I? I wasn't even born. I am still at my mother's breast. If it wasn't you, it was your brother. -I have none. -Someone close to you, then. Your shepherds and dogs have no sympathy for me. I've been told! I must seek revenge! Look out! The wolf! The wolf! The wolf! Run! Run! Come on, Fanny. You'll like Megève. What if we have to move again? You won't. You'll be safe in the Italian zone. But Italy's with Germany! Yes, but they don't persecute Jews. Where will you go? I'll close the house. We can't stay here. Ethel, Julian explained to me, when you have something minus something minus something, in the end, nothing's left. That's right. Go sit down. Get on the bus, Fanny. Kids, don't look! Don't wave! That's the bastard who ratted on us. Stop! Let me go! Pierre! Pierre! This way. Make it snappy! Fanny, I don't like it here. It's scary. -I don't believe this! -I know. They said there'd be no little ones! Take them upstairs! Everybody in bed! It's bedtime. Boys, lights out! -Where's your bed? -Over there but... Get over there! My sister can only sleep with me. She'll cry all night. You'll see her tomorrow. We sleep in our own beds! Learn to be independent. Go! Go on. Good night. Henri. Samantha. Anna. Oscar. Daniel. Sophia, and Maurice. That's it? Yes. Sorry, kids. Did you send Mom our address? Why doesn't she write? Has she forgotten us? Has she forgotten us? Leave me alone! -Why am I being punished? -You're not. You'll get some peace and quiet in the kitchen. -Like I said... -That's enough, Fanny! I got super spuds! Eli, this is Fanny, your new helper. Charmed, Miss! We'll make a dynamite team! I'll leave you. I warn you, Fanny, in the kitchen, as in life, it's all about presentation! You can sulk or you can laugh. And being in the country's not so bad! I couldn't find much today but... Which leaves us with a chiffonade of potatoes and turnips, in absence of meat, followed by a dearth of fowl, the mere memory of mushrooms... And for dessert, slivered almonds with a mirage of sugar! Shit! I lost track of time. Fanny, turn on the faucet. Full blast! No one can know. Especially Mrs. Forman. Our secret? I went to Lyon with my uncle. He had to make a delivery there! We won't go back soon! It's the Gestapo nest. It's no place for Resistance fighters. Torture city! Know what they do? Fanny, come play with me! Not now, Georgette. Play with Erika. -But she said... -Georgette! Those cockroaches won't be around for long. We'll draw and quarter those Krauts! We'll squash 'em like bugs! My buddies are in the Resistance. They're coming for me. To fight. Soon. Don't tell anyone! Not a soul! -You're leaving? -I'll be back! When the war's over. I can just see the celebrations! Allied tanks rolling into Paris... Girls cheering and throwing flowers... We'll come back to life! See this apple? It's good, but it can be even better. Just as you bite into it, think really hard, that the Krauts will never taste it! Why do you say it's better with your eyes closed? I told you, Georgette. You eat the blueberries thinking about... Oh, right! I know! The "scouts"! Not "scouts". Krauts! Here, try it. Yeah, it's true. They're better. Erika, we've gotta go! Mrs. Forman'll yell if we get back late. Sit there. Erika, want some? Pass that to Maurice and Daniel. Where are you from? The Italian government has announced the arrest of Benito Mussolini. Mussolini's been arrested! Mussolini arrested. You heard it, too, right? That means the war's almost over! Mussolini's been arrested! The war's almost over, Fanny! You heard it? You heard it, too? Mussolini's been arrested! We can go home! That's bad news! If the Italians are out, the Germans will take their place. -That'll take time. -No! The children must leave immediately. Dora said the smuggler was arrested. Find another one! They'll let him go. When? You come on your bike? Know what time it is? You're not going out now? You can sleep here tonight. I'll come right back, then get the kids ready. What's your name? What's your name? -Marcel. -Marcel what? -Marcel Mandelbaum. -No! Marcel Beaumont! Repeat it! Marcel what? -Marcel Beaumont. -Good, go back to sleep. Wake up. What's your name? Nicole Moussin. Good. Where are you going? -To Switzerland. -No! Never say Switzerland! You're going to summer camp in the mountains. Okay? Understand? Go to sleep. -What's your name? -Erika. No! You're Marguerite Bisson! Repeat that! -Marguerite Bisson. -Again. Marguerite Bisson. That's enough! She'll remember. Mommy, I'm not scared. Mommy, I'm not scared. Come on, let's go. My name's Fanny. Fanny Bisson. Boys and girls, I want you to listen to me very carefully. The first group will be supervised by David, who you will now call Denis. The second group will be supervised by Eli -now Etienne. Etienne and Denis will make all the decisions. With them, you have nothing to fear. -My book! -Georgette! You must never be separated from them. If a policeman or anyone else asks you any questions, say you're going to summer camp in the mountains. You must never use your real names, even amongst yourselves. And always speak French! -Is that clear? -Yes, ma'am. You'll make several stops. I'll be at every one. You'll be safe by tonight. We leave in 5 minutes. Paulette. I'll take over from here. Wait over there. How old are you? My sister's mute, she can't speak. -How old is your sister? -17. You'll never pass! You look older than 16. Etienne, stay with them. Come with me. -What's your name? -Jacques. -And you? -Maurice. And you? Come on, kids! Get in. Will our parents meet us there? -Yes. -When? Soon, very soon. Hop on! Get off! Quick! Get them aboard as soon as it's clear. No, no! Stay here. Papers, please. My suitcase! My suitcase was stolen! Officer, help! It was right there! Did you see anyone take it? I was looking in my purse, and suddenly it was gone. -What did it look like? -Small, with brown checks. -May I see your papers? -Yes, of course. -Mrs. Cellier? -Yes. -Follow me. We'll file a report. -Okay. André! Hop on! Don't worry, she was pretending. She's really good! We're on vacation! I'm happy! There are animals there, marmots and antelopes. Anyway, don't be afraid, there are no monsters! That's why we're going there. What monsters? Haven't you ever heard of the Naz...? Georgette, stop! There's no such thing as monsters. Sure there is. Just 'cause you've never seen one, doesn't mean they don't exist. That's nonsense! No, it's not. That's what I think. Well, what you think is stupid! There's no monster! And if it even sticks its nose out, I'll catch it, slice it to bits and cook it with artichokes. Or we'll marinade it in garlic! Why not fry up its ears? Or smother it in onions and make it cry. Or poke its eyes out. Hey, know how to run when the Krauts start shooting? In a zigzag. A moving target is harder to hit. And he agreed? He said, "How old are you, kid?" Right away, it's "kid"! I tried to cheat but at that point... Eli, what is it? -Eli? -Nothing, nothing. No! They're Italians! They're Italians. We're there. Erika, get up. Georgette, wake up. Wake up! -Where are we? -We're there. Maurice, wake up Jacques. Jacques, wake up. I gotta go! I'm sorry. What are you doing? Mrs. Forman said to wait in the train! She's coming. I can't. Here. -What'll we do without Eli? -Etienne! Why'd he leave us all alone? He's a yellow-bellied, chicken bastard! That's not true! Etienne's courageous! -He shit his pants, that's all. -He's not like that. He dropped us like hot potatoes, but he's really brave! You don't know him. Kids! Let's go. Where's Etienne? Why'd he do it? He jumped right into the wolf's mouth! No, you mustn't worry. Get on. Fanny, go as far as Annemasse. -Aren't you coming? -That's impossible. Why? You kids don't need identity papers. I do. And they're forged. If I have the slightest problem, you're done for! Understand? I can't come with you. But I'll follow you in a car. Kids, now Fanny's in charge. You must obey her! Always! That's impossible. I can't... See you later! Don't ever show your fear, Fanny! Never! But why me? There are others. No, there's just you! Diane is mute and Victor's too withdrawn. You're a hard head! That's a good thing. That's why you'll succeed. I'll meet you in Annemasse, by the "Summer Camp" sign. Aren't you ever scared? If you're scared, pretend. You hear me? Pretend! For the others! Fanny! Diane wants to know when we'll get there. Soon. Ladies and gentlemen, the trains aren't departing! The bridge has been bombed! The tracks are obstructed! So what do we do? Get off and take a connecting route. Ladies and gentlemen, everyone off the train! Where do we go? Sir! How do we get to Annemasse? There's a bus to Lyon in 20 minutes. On platform D. In Lyon, there's a train to Annemasse. Where's platform D? Lyon's Gestapo headquarters. It's crawling with Germans. -Then what do we do? -I don't know. We have no choice! Let's go! Go if you want, but count me out! Fanny, please stay! -Fanny! -Keep moving. Diane's here. Stay with the others. I can't go to Lyon. Rachel's parents were arrested in Lyon. I ran away with her. She's not my sister. Take us with you, please! -It's too dangerous. -Just us. Please. If you speak with that German accent, you're on your own. Thank you. Rachel! If anyone asks you anything, don't let Diane speak. Say I'll be right back. I'll go find Rachel. Fanny! Thérèse, where did you go? We're going to Grandma's in Lyon! Grandma! Grandma nice! That's for you. To remind you of me. Come on! Here! I was supposed to deliver it there. The address is inside. Open it when you get there. Deliver it by hand. How can I get there? We're all alone. You have no choice, Fanny. You have to deliver it! I'm counting on you. I know you'll make it. Have you ever seen the monster? Where's Diane? Waiting with the others. I found a train to Annemasse. By way of Lyon? No, a freight train. It's making a detour. Let's go. Get in. You can't just disappear like that. I was very scared. Eli got arrested. Because he was all alone. Like the lamb. That's why the wolf ate the lamb. From now on, we stick together. When does the train leave? We don't know but we can't talk. No way! Forget his letter. Toss it! He was so scared! I saw it in his eyes. And us? Weren't we scared? Weren't the little kids scared? But he took off to save his own skin! And we should run risks for that traitor? -No way! -Stop! Keep quiet! You wet the bed again? I had a nightmare, and I had to pee. Where'd you get that doll, Georgette? Mommy gave it to me. What mommy? Mrs. Forman? -No, the mommy at the station. -What mommy? Before, when you left. I was scared you'd forgotten us. So I asked Mommy if she'd seen the children going to Switzerland. -What lady? What did she look like? -I don't know her. She had a baby and she gave me this doll. See how pretty she is! My doll! You let her talk to a stranger? I told you to watch her! She won't listen. And you told me not to talk! Never speak to anyone! I've told you a hundred times! And especially not about Switzerland! What's in that head of yours? That lady was so nice. And I said my name was Georgette Bisson. She asked you your name? No, but that's what I'm supposed to say, so I did it. I'll check the last 2 cars! Quiet! Georgette, it's okay. We're going to Annemasse. -This is Annemasse. -Juju, how about that drink? Be right there! Just checking something. Wait 10 minutes, then take off. Good luck. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Okay, Fanny. That's 10 minutes. It's clear, let's go. SUMMER CAMP How long are we supposed to wait? If she doesn't come, we have to go. It's too dangerous. Go where? Hi, kids! Shall we? Let's go. Come on. In single file behind me! Come along, Marie Claire! We'll be at the chalet soon! Now you older kids take the little ones' bundles. Then run to the top of the hill! Run, run, run! I'm sick of walking. My shoe hurts. Come on! Here! Catch it! Kick, kick! Beautiful pass! Shoot! Let's see who's champ! Okay, now run! -Hello. -Hello. Where's Mrs. Forman? Why isn't she here? It'll be fine. But where is she? I don't know. Get in the truck. You're late. Not a sound in there! Shut him up, we'll get caught! That's the lady who gave me the doll. What's your name? Georgette Bisson. Your real name? Georgette Bisson. How old? -Six. -Where are your parents? In Paris. Who takes care of you? -I do. I'm her sister. -Shut up! So who takes care of you? My big sister... -Fanny Bisson. -Yeah, right! Where are you going? To summer camp. That's enough! Go back with the others. You, shorty. Come here! Go ahead... Where are you going? To summer camp. I can't hear you. What did you say? -To summer camp. -Where? In the mountains. And what's your name? -Jacques. -Jacques what? Jacques Laigle. -And you're not Jewish? -No. -You sure you're not Jewish? -Yes. Are you telling the truth? Yes. You! The tall kid with glasses! Come here. Come on! Step on it! So what's your name? Victor Dumas. -I suppose you're not Jewish either? -I'm Catholic. He's Catholic! -You're Catholic? -Yes. Drop your pants. We'll see right away! Excuse me. May I speak to you? Cart 'em off! They're all Jewish. -We're full up here! -Put 'em where you can. Jacques, give me your bag. I'm cold. Think the lady talked because we threw away the doll? No, Georgette. She didn't even know. SWITZERLAND Wake up! Come on! Everybody wake up! Come on! I'm all ears! The names of the people in charge of you. Come on, we'll let 'em mull it over. And remember... You talk, you eat! It's that simple! Stop! You're just like the rest of us. No, I'm not! And I'll do what I want! And you call Eli a traitor? You make me sick. He is a traitor! Let go. Maurice, can I have the Earth? Thank you. Please! My baby! You promised! Come on down. Are we really Jews? Yeah. If that's bad, let's not be Jews anymore. It's not bad, it's just how it is. But if we stop being Jews, we can leave. Yeah, but we can't stop being Jews. Why not? Come here. When I got to my bosses' house the house was empty. There was a note in the pot where I leave the change. It said to go pick up the "package" in the Mandelbaum's cupboard. I swung open the cupboard and there was Rachel, sound asleep. Her father had given her a sleeping pill. I picked her up and ran into the street. I want my mother. I wanna see her. "Dear sweet Mommy, "The police have arrested us. We're locked in. "I wish I were with you. I'm thinking of you." I'M HUNGRY So, no one's hungry? Well, go ahead! We're all locked in! Okay, kid, give us the keys. Don't be a smart ass! Give 'em back! What'll you do, if I don't? Beat us? Hit us? Starve us? -Bastard! -Traitor! Murderer! That's enough! Go on! Shoot! There aren't many of us! It won't take long! Thanks for contacting us. We'll get them out of here and put them in a safe place. Shall we just take them? No, we should give them one last meal before they leave. And worship your years to your supreme appeal They've responded, "Present" Marshal, here we are! Before you, Savior of France We, your boys, swear to serve Erika, hurry! -Your turn, Diane. -I won't fit through the window. -Victor got through! -I don't wanna keep running. I don't wanna keep running. Take Rachel, please! Go! Diane! What did Diane say to you before? That we'll meet up in Switzerland. This way! -My father gave it to me. -He's rich! Yeah. Can we play the money game again? That was fun! They were like 1,000 butterflies. Yeah, it was pretty! Let's go! They must be looking for us. Come here! There's a path! Those little kids can't have gone far. I come from a long line of hunters. No kid's gonna get away from me! So now what? I agree with you, Chief. Further off and to the left, it slopes down. They must have gone that way. I think they turned off, into the woods. We should turn back. Let's turn around. Hey! -Look! -Must be Kraut dough! -The French are broke. -Or Jew dough! There aren't many Yids left! Fanny! We have to slow down. They won't make it. We can't stop now! We have to go further. We have to find Mrs. Forman. You're crazy! That's impossible! We have to go back to Megève! That's too risky. We can't go back! We must be near the border. You don't know that! And we can't cross the border alone. We don't know where to go. We don't know anyone. Without Mrs. Forman, we'll never make it. Maybe she got arrested, too. When will we get there? I'm hungry. It hurts your teeth. It's hard as a rock. And it's disgusting! My feet hurt. I'm thirsty. Me, too! Where we going? Forward. You're bossy but you're as lost as we are. I'm not walking in circles for hours! Will Mrs. Forman ever find us? When will we get there? -I've had it! -That's enough! Yeah, we're hungry, we're thirsty! That's how it is! Whining about it won't help! I don't know where Mrs. Forman is! We're all alone now. It'll be fine. Keep walking. Stop that! Stop! Come and see! Come and see this! The whole place is deserted. Hey! The coast is clear! Shall we stay here? Tonight? Yeah. And every night. -And every day. -Till the end of the war? What if it goes on for years? We'll make due. We can hunt, build fires. And our parents? We'll find them afterwards. After the war. We can set up camp here. I've done it lots of times. The stream's nearby. We're up high, we can see any danger. You were right. We can only rely on ourselves. And maybe one day we'll walk to the border. -Come here! -What? Come on! This is the dining room! -See the nice table we made? -Yeah! This is the kitchen. I really like this house. I may just buy it! May I tour the rest of the property, with... my wife? What's wrong with you? He's crazy! -Come on, wife! -I'm not your wife. Then we can be your kids! This is the master bedroom. At night, you can gaze at the stars! And us kids can play in peace. What do you think, sweetheart? Still crazy as a loon. But this bedroom is the cat's meow! And it suits us to a T! -Tell me, dear husband... -Yes? With all this space, what if we got a dog? -Yeah, a performing pooch! -Performing plays? "Performing" means we can teach him tricks. -And a farting horse? -What did I hear? Or a stinky monkey! And a vomiting mouse! And a poopy koala! And a depressed lizard! -And a deer! -With a fat rear! -And a teeny genie! -With two weenies! "We, the Marshal of France, -"the French head of 'street'..." -"State." "the French head of state decrees: To eliminate any Jewish influence in the national economy, the Commissioner General for Jewish Affairs may appoint a temporary administrator to any property, whenever the owners are Jewish." -What does that mean? -It means, if you're Jewish and you have a shop, Vichy can steal it. Especially if business is good. What if that's your job? You have no choice. They have no right! It's not fair! I have a stomachache. We didn't eat enough. Erika said I'm too little and I don't run fast enough. She's mean to me. I don't wanna stay here. Did you eat anything? -Hazelnuts. -It couldn't be the hazelnuts. -And some red berries. -When? Where? When we were playing hide-and-seek. I'm cold... Diane... We have to go for help. -Let's get outta here! -No! We have to find out if they're German or French. Why? If they're German, we're safe. We can go through. And if they're French? What are they? I don't know. -We have to know. -I can't. It looks like a German helmet. Maybe he was a collaborator. Or a Resistance fighter the Germans killed. Anyway, we've got no choice. Wait! We can't just leave the little kids. If anything happens to me, promise to take care of my sisters. And also that you'll deliver Eli's letter. I heard the German's talking. They were gonna send Eli to a prison camp. Promise you'll take the letter, Victor. I promise. I'm Jewish. Now I see! My livestock ate those once. I thought they'd croak. -Like you kids today. -Are they deadly? No. They didn't die but... It was horrible. And given the state these kids are in, they must've gone to town! They puked their guts out! They'll be okay. Now they need sleep. Go on! You can spend the night. But in the morning, you have to go. I'd like to do more but... I know. Thank you. -Are we far from the Swiss border? -Not that far. How long, on foot? On foot? It's quite a hike! Okay. He's mean! He could've let us stay longer. He could have left us out in the cold, too. And tomorrow where do we go? I don't wanna think about that. Here. That's yours. Does your camera work? Depends what you wanna see. How do you feel this morning? I slept like a log, sir. Call me Jean. 'Morning! Thank you so much. Eat quickly then go out the back door, through the woods. And don't mention me to anyone. We never met, okay? Good luck. Wait! If we work, could we stay a while? No! That's impossible. -We're good workers! -Even better than the big kids. Yeah, but yours aren't heavy. Not so loud! They may not be as heavy but we're little, so it's more work. That's true. So we get more milk. And get to sleep with the puppies! You've been very naughty. When you misbehave, I can't serve my customers. You like Erika better! You don't like Maurice! You like Erika better! There's something on your shoulder! Last night, I was thinking... With my money, we could pay a smuggler. Who could we trust? We don't know anyone! They'll take your money and dump us anywhere. Isn't it worth a try? No. We're safe here. We have to stay as long as we can. What are you doing, Jacques? The faster we work, the sooner we'll have to leave. We can't put too much back. Just a little bit every day. Fanny! I saw Diane! She's here! Come here! The Red Cross ladies came back with the policemen. The tall one left the door open. On purpose, I think. Then I walked as far as the deserted village. I fell asleep. When I woke up, I saw a man. He asked if I was with the others. And here I am! You got here even sooner than you said. Yeah. Yeah, we can all go together. Do you have anyone living with you? Any Jews? Jews? What are "Jews"? We're requisitioning the farm. House, food... everything. My men will be back tomorrow. At dawn. From now on, the Italians are finished here. Nothing but Germans! We're done for. Now there are Krauts everywhere. Yesterday, we could have gotten away. But I wanted the kids to eat and rest a bit. It's all my fault! We were so happy here. It's Eli's letter. Open it. He must've made a mistake. What does it say? Yeah, what does it say? He says he was scared, that he made a mistake. He hates himself for leaving us behind. But he's with us and thinking of us through this letter. This letter that we'll carry across the border. He says you're all so courageous. -And that we'll make it. -He says all that? Yeah. And that we'll be free and we'll find our parents. You're still here? Take off! -Do you know a smuggler? -No. Go! You must know someone. If we get caught, it'll be dangerous for us. But it may be for you, too. Little lamb, it's best if you stay here with the other animals. We're going to the city. And you don't even speak Swiss. If you give it all away, you'll have zero bills left. Zero is nothing but one is something. -One's different than zero. -You're right. One's not the same thing. That's for you. I don't need it anymore. Hurry. Not a sound. The town's crawling with Germans. You're 5 kilometers from the border. You have 45 minutes. Take this footpath. You'll reach a road. Cross it but be careful! The Germans make their rounds there. Then run into the woods. Go to the hole in the barbed wire. Slip through before the guards find it. Then run as far as the anti-tank barrier. In between is "No Man's Land." That's the most dangerous! The gray house is Switzerland. Understand? Go! Go, go, go! Not that way! Italy's to the left! No, it's the opposite! Hurry! Run! Run! Climb on! Hallelujah, Thank God. Praise God for his eternal grace. Fanny Ben-Ami now lives in Israel. The three sisters remained in Switzerland until the end of the war. In 1946, they returned to France but never saw their parents again. The character of Mrs. Forman was inspired by Lotte Schwarz (principal of Château de Chaumont) and Nicole Weil-Salon, 2 of many who were prepared to give their lives to save the children. From 1938 to 1944, thousands of children were saved from deportation by the Organization to Save the Children, which rescued, hid and helped them escape into Italy, Switzerland, Spain and the United States.
