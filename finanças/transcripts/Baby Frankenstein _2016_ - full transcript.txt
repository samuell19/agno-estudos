I dress up still. I love the costumes, the parties. Are you taking your little brother tomorrow? You ought to, he's freaking scary. That's a great costume. Sounds like a lot of fun, yeah. Let's go. - Come on baby, let's go. - Bye bye. Come on. Alright thanks guys! Okay guys, thanks. Bye Mr. Spintho, thanks. - Bring me back some candy! - Okay.

Not really sure what I want, but I do know that I don't want to spend a lot of money. I understand. I'm not really sure what I can afford. Well, we got a great financial, you know, different plans, layaway, you came to the right place. What kind of couch? I don't know, I kind of like... This kind of couch, this kind of couch. No, I kind of like this kind of couch. No no no no, this is bad. This is like sitting on a prison floor. Which you're very familiar with, as I recall. Some people prefer that. It's a little stiff, but you know, a lot of people prefer that, you know. - It's a preference. - You're a preference. Listen, stop being rude. - What, come on. - You're being a jackass. - Stop it. - Alright fine. I gotta whiz. Where's the ter-let? It's down in the basement. - No. - Just take the escalator - down there. - Come on. Is there an employee ter-let I can use? No, not at the moment? Really, 'cause you were bringing boys in there all the time? You could use the exercise. Alright, but this is the couch, baby. I'm serious. I've been sitting on couches my whole life. I know what I'm talking about, alright? Let's, come on. I'm sorry about that. I'm still trying to train him how to act in public, - and as you can see... - It's alright. It's not really working out very well. - That's alright. - You know you get used to it. - Anyway, yes. - Well anyway. This is, you know, I know you mentioned couch, - but this is... - No, I think I like this. This is cream of the crop. It's nice and big, it's roomy. That is cat nap re-impulse recliner sofa. - It sounds fancy. - Kind of. It's kind of like the best of both worlds. Alright, well this comes in these colors here, alright? We got this orange, we got this colonial blue, we got this pea green, okay. I don't know, I kind of like... No, easy buddy. Easy buddy. Loving the fashion, huh? Oh no no no, not scary enough. Definitely not scary enough, come on. What do we got here? What do we got? Definitely not scary enough either. That would fit you, though. Sorry man, sorry. This way, come on. - Hey, we got nothing. - What about this? Oh no no no. What do you mean? - I think it's gonna look cute. - That's not gonna work right? - Can you see it? - No. - That's not gonna fly, right? - What do you mean? That's not gonna fly. Does he look like a little fairy princess to you? No, he looks like a big mean warrior, doesn't he? I think it'd look cute! I wonder if this place has any costumes at all. I've been looking, I can't find any. Oh look, looks like he works here. Excuse me, sir. Excuse me, sir. Come here for one second. So we're looking for Halloween costumes. All we found was this. Do you have anything else? Something a bit more manly, maybe. Like you know, for this guy right here. Hello? - It's okay. - Thanks. - Come on, let's go. - We're good, thanks. Have a good day. Don't worry about us. It's okay. It's okay, you're okay, it's fine. Getting some flare-ups. Oh perfect. He's not scared at all. It's easy, dude. I think he mentioned something about Yoda. What? - I don't see it. - You good, you good? You good? One step at a time. Natural, he's a natural. Oh, the Chupacabra! We caught the Chupacabra! Come on! Hello, hi. This is Ken Glinevich. I'm calling for Agent Lundquist about the monster, I mean, the suspect. For the reward. Yeah, no. Don't put me on hold. Okay, no I'm okay. No sir, I'm not drunk. Agent Lundquist, please. - Daredevil. - He wants to go higher. Put your hands back up there. Oh no. Easy buddy. Whoa. He just never quits, does he? No, look at him over there. I'm loving every minute of this. He's awesome. We can't just keep him forever. I don't want to think about that. I guess my mom could use the reward money. Who even knows if there's actually a reward, Lance? I mean, something was fishy about that guy, and I wouldn't trust him. I don't know, I'm just worried. I mean, what if Glinevich finds out? You know, we can either sit here, and drive ourselves absolutely crazy, worrying about questions we don't have the answer to, or we could just hang out, have fun. I mean, just live life a little. Yeah I guess so. I haven't been this excited about Halloween since I was a little kid. Yeah, me too. - You're right. - You know what? We'll figure it out. Don't worry, okay? Okay. Look at him. He just can't get enough. You think he's alright? How's it going, Agent Lundquist? I was under the impression you'd be coming alone. Yeah, well this is my partner, Mr. Van Steed. Very well, then, have a seat. So about that 50K. Patience. Hi there. Would you gentlemen like a menu? We're fine, thank you. - Gentlemen, eat, please. - Oh wait wait wait. Can I get some garlic powder? I don't do garlic salt. - Sure thing. - And some Parmesan cheese. Sure. And a side of hot sauce. - What kind? - Hot. Yeah, I meant like mild or hot. Hot! Got ya. It'll be right up. Happy? I will be. So Mr. Glinevich, you have knowledge of the suspect, you've seen him? We both know that thing is not human. - Stay calm, mister... - Oh I am calm. And I'll tell you what. You just tell us how to get our money, and we will give you that little Chupacabra monster, and we will be on our way to Isla Moreles. Do you actually have it in your possession? No, but I will. I promise. I could do it. Can I get you anything else? No Chupacabra, no money. Oh, can I get a to-go box? Sure thing. You got a pen? Pardon? Do you have a pen? Gracias. Okay, this is what I want you to do. I want you to meet me at this address. Thank you, thank you very much. That was a waste. Be at that address tomorrow at midnight. - I will. - Okay, okay. And bring the money, because no money, no Chupacabra. Later alligator. Have a good night.

He's just having a little fun. - Come on. - Yeah, he's right at home. - You can be mad at that. - Well, you know. The house has been kind of lonely. - So what do you think? - Maybe I can use a guest. - Okay, I'll use it... - Perfect, yeah. - That sounds great. - Oh you're the best. Wait wait wait, ah, wait.

Look at him, he's insane. - Look, I am not. - Look at his eyes. - Let me just explain. - Calm down. I'm calm, okay? Here's the thing. Your son knows where I can get 50,000 dollars. There's a little Chupacabra monster. - I have no idea. - I'm trying to just get him to tell me where it is, but he won't tell me where it is, and that's all I want to know. Ask him, you ask him where it is. I won't, I just want to know - where it is. - You are out of your mind. Why don't you ask him what he plans to do with it? He's gonna give me 50,000 dollars, and I just gotta get this thing, - and he knows where it is. - No I don't. And I'm just trying to get him to tell me where it is, and he's lying to me about it. - Why are you lying? - Why don't you tell her, why don't you tell her about your Isla Moreles plans after you've gained this 50,000 dollar? - What, what? - Right right right! - Look at him! - What? - Just lying through his... - I'm not lying! - Don't get near him! - Come on, watch. Alright. - Get out of my house. - Get out. - No. - You, and your creepy little friend over there. Don't even try to touch me. - Get out, now. - You go, mom. - And don't you ever... - I swear to God. Don't you go near my son again. - Alright. - Do you understand? You know what? I don't hit women. That's the kind of guy I am. That's the kind of guy you moved... Oh, you're a stand-up guy. - Good for you. - Yeah. Stand up guy, Glinevich. Get the hell out. Come on, baby, don't be like that. - Don't baby me. - Don't baby me. - You know, come on. - Get out! - Hey. - Get out of my house now! - Whoa, whoa! - Now!

Don't go near him. We're out of here. You're a bitch, and your son is an idiot. Guess what, now I'm a single bitch. He's a liar! Let's go have incest with each other. I've been telling you. Do you finally understand? I'm sorry. Unbelievable. Party's over. Un-freaking-believable. Hey, okay, alright, alright. I'm sorry, are you okay? I'm okay. I'm trying. I am, I'm trying as hard as I can. I know you are, mom. I'm leaving now! Be right back, little Gary. - Hi, John, hi. - Hi. Look what I got! Thank you. But you didn't have to do that. Did you just hear all that? I heard something, but, you don't want to go inside? It's cold out, let's go inside. No, the hot chocolate will keep us warm. I need to clear my head. Fresh air will help. - Smells good. - Sure. So what's your deal? Are you married, have a girlfriend, any kids? I was married. - What happened? - I knew something was weird when she was going to the chiropractor like every other day. And then I knew it was over when he started making house calls. Yikes, that's not good. I always wanted kids. I'd be a good father. You know, it's not all it's cracked up to be. You get this vision in your head, you know, of how you think it should be. And then your husband leaves with a waitress, and that vision and all those ideas that you had, they just, they go. I'm sorry about that. Don't be sorry. He was a jerk, and so was Ken. So I'm better off. I'm sorry. Hey, why are we talking about this? I should be inviting you to the Halloween party. I throw a big Halloween party. Everybody comes, the whole block. This house, it gets packed. Oh yeah, I'm gonna decorate it. I mean, you want to come? Oh God, do I have to wear a costume? Well, yeah, I mean, no, you don't have... But if you don't, you know, people are gonna look at you kind of funny. Ugh. I could help you with a costume. I got a lot of costumes. I don't think I've worn a Halloween costume - in like 20 years. - 20 years? Yeah, it's been a long time. Well you don't know what you've been missing. Hm. What do you say? You know what? I'll go.

Go ahead, little dude. - It's okay. - It's okay buddy. You'll be safe, go ahead. - You're in good hands now. - It's alright. Mr. Lundquist will take good care of you, okay? I sure will.

It's okay man. Aw. It's okay. Don't worry about it. You're in good hands with him. You know, my grandfather invented Jeremy so many years ago to serve mankind, but was afraid people would abuse him. Use him for evil instead of for good. He's our friend, Mr. Lundquist. Friend. I know that, Lance. Perhaps it's time we do what's best for Jeremy. Allow him to be happy and free. I think that's a great idea. I think he's earned that. We'll take good care of him, I promise. Sounds like a plan. Alright! Goodbye, everyone - Bye Mr. Lundquist. - Bye Mr. Lundquist. Thank you.
