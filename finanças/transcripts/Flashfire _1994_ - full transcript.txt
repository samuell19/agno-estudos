Captain, I don't have to remind you, this is a crime scene... - What next? - How do you mean "what next"? How do you mean "I guess he never learned his lesson"? Captain said, Art was rip the man for dating a prostitute. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. - Captain? You all right? - I can't breathe. Give me some water. Do you want me to... - Here. Sit, right here. - I'm tearing apart inside. I knew Art for 35 years. He was my friend. - What a hell is going on here? - Easy. Deep breathe, cap. So... so, where the hell is that water? - Here you go, sarg. - Thanks. Here. Easy now. I think I see one death too many. - He was my friend. - I know. I don't know about you, how you must feel. This must have been hitting you. Same as you and, um... Sick. I lost somebody who was close to me as Art was... Anybody know anything about that, um... - That woman? - No, nothing. I just can't... I just can't believe, Art was such a family man... - Skeletons. - What? Skeletons. Everybody got one in the closet. You don't know anything about anybody, really. Till after they are dead. He was the best. He took a bullet for me, one time. The gun jammed, he stepped in front of me. Got shot off. Took the bullet for me. After I got that desk job, I never got a chance to pay him back. - Are there any suspects? - Just a whore. Jumped of the balcony. Hopefully we get ID from the prints. "You might be a hero today but, you are still a traitor to your fellow officers". "Hi! It's Meredith. Saw you on TV. Incredible. Why you don't give me a call"? "Jackie Jack, hi honey, heard the story on the news, are you OK"? "We just wanna call right away, telling you we are so proud on you". "We are so proud on you, we will see you later. Really, what a brother, wow". Damn it! - I still can't believe that you jumped? - Yeah, I can't tell you how spooky it was. Hey, you're Wonder Woman, my own personal superhero. Yeah, anyway... I left my purse there, they have my drivers license, they know where I live. Hey, we will just have our own prolonged slumber party, all right? I have got 45 pounds of junk food in that kitchen, I have 15 videos and a deck of cards. We will never have to live. Art was such a nice man. I don't know why anyone would wanna kill him? I just keep thinking you know, maybe I should done something. Yeah, you should saved your hide which is what you did. - Otherwise, you would be... - Yeah. Yeah. I know. Unless I mistake, it's time for my going and make a popcorn. - Right. Time to eat. - Exactly.

Here you go. - Thanks. - Sergeant... - May this be your worst moment. - Cheers. Captain, just may be worst then you think. You mean what? Meaning, if I want in legal research, I could become practicing for lawyer. This is only temporarily, you know that. - I wanna stay on arsen. - There's no arsen, Jack. Budget cuts. For now on arsen is gonna be taken care by fire dep. You finish the case that you working on, and that's gonna be it. Hey, Jack? Listen to me. There is no accident that I become a Captain. Everybody has an angel. I have one and you got me. You do your year on this assignment, and I promise you, I'll take you back into the detective division. You can work everywhere you want. I just...

Ah, just a half naked female who runned trough a lobby. Does gate keeper has anything to contribute? Yeah, he said that he saw it but, what can we do when we don't keep books anymore. Description was a little more detailed when he told me about it. Look, what do you want me to do Jack? I took down what he give me. Clerk said anything about any golfers? Yeah, but he could not placed them at the scene. I mean... ... hotel is full of golfers this time of year. I guess you didn't talk to the maid, cuz she placed them outside his room 5 minutes before he got shot. - A maid? - Housekeeper for the floor. I'll check it out. Thanks Jack. Thanks. I don't believe this guy, rats out on Lavery, now telling people - how they do their job. - It's nothing. - "It's nothing"? - Art was his partner. Yeah. It should be him standing in that hotel room instead of Art. If Captain didn't put him in the legal research, he would made it - through the week. - Probably less then that. I would not bet on that. Hi, Katie. - Captain? - Yeah, Jack? I make the composite of the arsonist. I liked to release to the press. - Yeah, you wrap that up. - Yes, sir. Umm. - May I speak to you in your office, please? - Yeah, go ahead. It's about Arts murder. I think Sherwin is blowing it. I got back to a hotel, I talk to witnesses, got information that he did not have. - Or wasn't following through... - We have been through this before. You are a sergeant in the legal research department. - But, there's vital information... - No, no. no, buts about... Sherwin has his job to do and you have your job to do. - Stay out of it. - What about the leads? I'll follow that with Sherwin. Look, I just thought, if there was a way... You want me to be formal about this, I will be formal about this. I am ordering you to stay away from investigating all the witnesses in this case. Is that clear? - Yes, sir. - Good! Now, get out of here. I've got a lot of work to do. - Channel 6? Ron Masters, please. - One moment, please. - This is Ron Masters. - Hello. This is detective Jack Flinder. Do you remember who I am? Yes, detective. We meet at the department of fire. Good. How would you like helping me catch an arsonist? - Welcome to legal research, Jack. - Are we...? We are subject of your first training bulletin in sexual harassment and ethics that is a still from state international legation. But the research is all here. Yeah. Legal research? Oh, does a matter a fact he just walked in. It's a woman. - Hello? - Jack? - Yes, who is this? - This is Mary, look... ... I don't have a lot of time right now, so I'm going get right to the point. I was with Art Cantrell the night he was murdered. And the same people who murdered him, are trying to murder me. Really? Can you prove that? What do you mean can I prove it? I was there. - Well, where are you now, Mary? - Why? Well, I think we have to meet in person. I won't do it. Not unless you promise you wont take me downtown. You know, I can't make that kind of a promise. I can identify one of his killers. There were 2 white men dressed as golfers. Can you meet me at 5:30 at a Staffords. Get in the back entrance. OK, bye. Are you Jack? - Mary? - Yeah. - I mean no, no. Lisa is my real name. - Okay. Look, look, I need you to understand when I say... - Call the police. - You are the police. I did call the police. They are only interested in me so they can arrest me for Arts murder. - What makes you think I wouln't? - I trusted you. - Can I? - Lets sit. Come on. This way please. Ask the waitress to get us 2 coffee, please. Certainly. - Is that all right? Coffee? - Yeah. Ok, why you don't tell me what happened? I was at Monica's apartment, door bell ringed, she went to the door, I heard the shot, - and she was murdered. - Wait, who? - Who's Monica? - Monica is my girlfriend. I went to her apartment after leaving the hotel, they found me - and they killed her... - Alright, all right. - They murdered her and... - Stop. All right. Let's back to the beginning. What's your name? - Lisa Cates. - What were you doing at the hotel with Art? - You are prostitute? - No, I'm not a prostitute. - Well, Tell me what where you doing? - I am not a prostitute. How I know you are not involved in the murder? If I were, will I jump from the balcony into the pool, leaving my purse and my ID behind. - You left your ID in your purse? - Yes. Now you understand why I'm so scared? OK. Tell me what happened before that. 2 guys dressed as golfers, broke into the room. They had on Groucho Marx glasses. They shoot Art, one of them felt his glasses, I saw his face - and he tried to kill me. - Can you identified this guys face? - Yes. - Good. - Here we go. - Thank you. And for you. Why don't you tell me about this other person, friend of yours? I went... I went to her apartment after I runned from the hotel. They found me there. And I know it's the same 2 guys. I am not crazy. I am not dragging, I am not lying to you. I need you to help find this guys. I'll do everything to help you, but I am not going downtown. - Why are you so afraid of them? - Because they know thing about me. I am the perfect scapegoat. You take me downtown and you wont hear a beep out of me. - I say you are restrained... - Oh, that's comforting. I put you in the hotel for a couple of days till I sort this things out. No! That's how Art was killed. Look, you loose me, you loose your only eyewitness. I put you in my house, if I don't uncover anything in 72hrs I'm gonna have to take you downtown myself. - This is nice. - Thanks. - What do you thinking? - That I must have known, that you and Art are meeting at the hotel at that time. - Well, yeah. We had a standing date. - Aha. You know, I resent that "aha"! Stop putting as a defensive, I try figure this out as well as you are! In order to do that I have to put you some question. Questions I don't mind, it's the insinuations that bother me. I've been up all night, I am tired, I am dirty and if you don't mind I would like to freshened up before we finish up this little inquisition. - This is not an inquisition. - Oh, yeah? Well, can you prove it? Bathroom is down the hall, towels are on your right. Thank you. - Who is it? - It's me. It's us. - We are here. - Hi. - Aren’t you gonna open the door? - Sure. I think that Jackie Jack forgot, when he look through the window, he said: "Oh, no, what are they doing here"? I didn't forget, I, I just thought they are got early then I expected. If you tell me you forgot, I wouln't be surprised. - Disappointed yes, surprised no. - Don't say anything, Jack. - I didn't forget, I didn't forget... - Don't tell me, don't tell me... Let me guess? A really bad time. I'm sure daddy if he know what a busy man you are gonna be, we be consulting with you for choosing his date of birth. Maybe so he considerate that way that men are always thinking about themselves and that... - You must have a maid. - No. - Are you ready? - No. Umm... Yes. No, umm... - No, yes, no, yes, yes... - Ann? Ann? My God, I can hear that loud shit of a music even... ...in the... bathroom. - Hi. - Hi. I'm Ann. Jack's sister. And this is Kurt, my ever loving hobby. I'm sure Jack speaked about us frequently and foundly, about his shallow, self involved, uninformed... ... sister and brother in law. When you put it that way, yes he mentioned you. Well, we are not all that superficial, we are just modern family - in what those things Jack does so well. - Yes, he’s mastered that art. I'm sure Jack told you about our father's birthday partying? Jack, where are your manners? - She is... - I... I really should not... Oh, what pressing plans do you have this evening? Answer me one question. It's run in the family. What better evening could you possibly have, then going to a birthday party? Hanging out, on the fabulous yacht. Drinking, dancing, going wild, yes. - I know. - So? - Do you have a problem? - No. Look at this girl, she is so resourceful. She can take care of herself. I shop 4 days and spend more then 700 dollars, she's going into my brothers closet, 5 minutes later couple safety pins and looking like a million dollar bucks. I'm not sure if we can be friends. - There she goes. - Wow. I'm here, the party can start now. Are you sure this is OK? I'm not pretty dressy. - They better look on you then on me. - You could have got us out of this. - Don't say anything. - What am I supposed to say? This is not my girlfriend. This is fugitive from justice, she just stay with me - for a couple of weeks. - Yeah, that will work. - Jack? Jack? - Hi, Meredith. Meredith, this is Lisa. Lisa, Meredith. - Have we ever meet before? - No, I don't think... Of course, the LA Country Museum. Jack, I saw you on TV. - Did you get my message? - Was that you? Daddy! Happy birthday, daddy. You look right. - Happy birthday, dad. - Thanks, Jack. Ralph Flinder, Lisa Cates. - Hi. Hello. - Excuse me for borrowing him. It will take a just a moment, OK? Come with me on the foredeck.

Excuse me. You know I am just curious, when you look around at your friends, it must upset you to see them passing you by? No. But maybe I don't see it that way. Well, I don't wanna tell you what to think. But if you don't see it that way, you are kidding yourself. - See Phill Kitting over there? - Yes. - Well, he is gonna make partner this year. - Really? Then I should congratulate him. Could not carry your hat, but his pulling down 6 figures. - Doing wants he must do, non the less. - Wants? What a hell is that have to do with it? Isn't this what is about, dad? Wanting to please you instead of me. I wander where you would be, if I thought that way. Dad, did you ever wanna do what you did not wanna do? Attend at your police academy graduation. You are right son, you do what you wanna do. Everyone got to die someday. I always thought there's an exception made for me. Dad, it is your birthday, do we have to do this? I just get a little frustrated at sometimes. I have biggest law firm in the city, and my only son don't wants part of it. - I can't believe in to. - Kurt. Why you don't wanna be rational and took... - Jack, you promised me a dance. - I did. Your dads eyes turn into a bloodshed. You caught my dad in the middle of a conversation. No one has ever done that before. That's one of advantageous of not knowing the rules. - Mind if I cut in? - Yes we do. - What? - Art said... you managed to turn silver spun into a disadvantage. I have no regret about it. So, you become a cop, instead of going into family business. - Wich is what? - 250 million dollar worth law firm. Oh. I thought it was a boat business. Jack. So, how are the things in the underworld? - Full of surprises. - Ah... Lisa, was just telling me how you two meet. - Was she? - Aha. She told she was a suspect - in murder case. - It was a quiet day, so... - Good night. - Good night. Nice talking to ya. Good night. - You are already leaving? - We have another engagements. You know Jack, when he gets the urge? I hope we made it to the car. - How are you gonna get home? - Axel will take us. - Who's Axel? - Dad's chauffeur. Let's get out of here. - Pinball. - You mean Art had played pinball? Aha. I need it a doubles partner until he talked to the machine. And then he told the machine: "Over"! So the change went everywhere. You know, I never thought I would get hurt by coins. So, he... a felt responsible for that. And we kind a started, seeing each other a little. I guess you could say we had an intellectual relationship. - Geez, what's that? - I don't know. I can't believe it I considered in to order and buying that. According to me, this next bite, I don't want it, but my tongue is sending a messages to my brains with a sweet taste sensations there, therefore I eat. It's over there.

You want more, there's nothing... - There's got to be more. Shut up! - You came to me... You can't even get the DA on the phone! Last call you make it, it won't bee from the jail! - Why you call me down here? - So we can make the deal! We are making the deal. You are in so deep! No deal, man! Unbelievable. Tried to put something together and get shot right under you. At least he won't light fires anymore. - Where is Durand? - He is on his way. So, you get any more information on who...? - On what? - I don't know. I thought you said, he was the suspect in murdering Art. - Yeah? - Is detective Flinder there? Hold on. It's for you. Hello? I am on the corner on the 1st and LA. I am gonna stay here in case we cut off. - Did you not see me blink the lights? - No, I missed that. One of Arts killers, the one that I saw, walked around the corner at the bar door, and then he took off. He had a gun... ... and then just runned up the street. I must have missed something like that. I know, I know, it's not your job, right? Come on! Come on! Let's book! That's the... that voice... that's the other guy. - That's the other man. - Man? What are you talking about? The second man. They killed Art, and then he said: "Let's book". - That's just an expression. - No. Listen to me damn it! Listen to me! On his wrist he has a tattoo, on his right wrist. It's a domino, half a tic tac toe... Somebody wanna tell me what a hell is going around here? - It's quiet a storm. - I've gotta go. What can you tell me, Jack? Captain, I need to speak to you in private. Well, hey, I can take a hint. I'm gone. Sherwin? About this night, I just want to say I haven’t been myself lately and I... had a lot going on and, umm... I haven’t been in my head mostly, but I'm back and... I just wanna say thanks. - For understanding. - Uh, well, hey, Jack... I'm always there for you. No problem, ha? Thanks. - Can I talk to you? - Yeah. I'm eager to hear about legal research. Sherwin was in on Arts murder. What? Him and insurance investigator Kraus fon Zack. Are you out of your mind? Lyman before got shot, connected Kraus fon Zack to Arts murder. Oh, you believe story of an arsonist who's about to go to a gas chamber. Go on. Kraus was also the shooter tonight. He shot Lyman. You saw it? - Lisa Cates did. - Lisa Cates? Lisa Cates! We identified Lisa Cates as a prime suspect in Arts murder, Jack. - Let me finish... - Where the hell is she? - She's safe. - Safe? Safe? Jack, Lisa Cates is a light hook. You know what light hook is? Light hook is somebody who hooks only when it's profitable. To... To move some drugs, to run a con, anything that works. She is tough and she is smart. Very smart. And you're over your head. Then how come Lisa Cates, can identified Sherwin's voice? And a tattoo on his right wrist? There has been a second shooter on Arts murder. All right. All right. If you gonna pursued this, I have no choice but to roll in it. But You, are gonna have to bring Lisa Cates in. - No. - Yes! I'll put you in the witness protection. - No... - Listen! Listen to me! At least until... I arrest and indict Sherwin. - Witness protection? - Yeah. Half the cops out here, hate you because what you did to Lavery. Now you are accusing a homicide detective of an obnoxious murder. For a cop killing. It's is the only way for me to keep you for not getting killed, Jack. Lisa Cates? Damn! All right, listen. Listen to me, this is gonna take me... at least a day. And everything will be taken care of so the earliest day to take you in, is tomorrow night. - Yeah. - OK. Meet me at parking structure at Royal Building on the 3rd level at 8 p.m., and you bring the girl. We will take you in, take your statements, and I'll take it from there. In the meantime, I want you to go hiding, don't go home, just rent some room in a hotel or somewhere. And don't you call me, I don't wanna know where you are. How am I supposed to go out of here without being followed? Well, I will walk you about 10 yards or so... ... and then, umm... you are on your own. All right? Let's go. I hope this turns out to be like you said, for your sake. So do I. OK, but how the shooter knew where to find me? - You said he could followed Lyman. - Could have taken Lyman anytime. I don't understand what are you saying? I am saying that Lyman led the shooter to me. - Are you saying that I set you up? - Did you? No! I tried to warn you! - How? - I flash lights just like you told me to. I did not see them flash. This is not about me setting you up, is it? It's exactly what it's about. No, it's not. This is about people letting you down. And you can't stand a fact that they are wrong and I am right. Because you got this idea about who they are not and who I am. And you just fit with what you want. Well, I didn't killed Art, I didn't set you up and I am the only person who wants the same thing what you want, but you just can't believe that, can you? What is it exactly that you think I want? Well, I thought it was the truth, but I don't know anymore. There he is. Jack... - That van... - What about it? It was in front of Monica's house, the night she was murdered. Jack! Jack! Listen... - Lisa? We are safe... - No! Hey, listen to me... Look at me. Look at me. Lisa? Look at me. Look at me. Deep breathe. Easy. I am sorry. I am so sorry, I have doubt at you. You hear me? "Just last week, officer Flinders testimony was crucial in convicting his fellow officer Anthony Lavery of theft. Here is latest freaking news of what has been called the hero cop turned cop killers story". "We, recovered this weapon from the house of detective Jack Flinder today. Along with other incriminating evidence. It also appears that detective Flinder was a involved with one of prime suspects of on outgoing murder investigation of a detective, Art Cantrell... ...one special case..." Son of a bitch! "Myself and detective Sherwin tried to talk to him to surrender peacefully, and in shootout, a innocent bystander was killed. Now we got a massive manhunt going on. I will update you on following progress, thank you very much". Oh, no, no, thank you. - Hello? - Hey, dad, it's Jack. Jack? Are you all right? What's happening? I have been set up... Durand was on in the arsen and now he tries to set me up for Arts murder. Do you have hard evidence, son? I can prove that Sherwin and a guy named, Kraus fon Zack killed Art, cuz he found out that they are making 3 million on a loss of a burned building, that they set up fires and Durand was running the all show. He's been on television, moping out the rug. I know. You should surrender to a criminal lawyer. I can arrange that. - I don't know. - Where are you now? - I'm on the boat. - Good. You stay right there. I'll get the lawyer and come down. Don't leave that boat. - Don't tell me you don't love this? - What? - Lawyer rescuing the cop. - No, I don't love it. I love you. I love you too. - Operator desk. - Hello. This is Captain Benjamin Durand, LAPD, I'd like address check on... ... 310-555-3425. - Captain Durand? - Yes? That number is registrated to on yacht. Registrated owners Flinder, Barton and Horowitz, from the legal corporation. Location, and the name of the yacht? That would be: "The Dancing Light". Docked in the Long Beach Marina. Ship number D-55. - Thank you very much. - You are welcome. Sherwin? - Hey, I got a location on Jack. - Let's do it. It will be all over soon. Will it? - Did you hear a car? - I don't know. - There it is. - Let's back out of sight. - They are here. - So soon? Dad would walk. It's Durand. And probably Sherwin. - How did they find us? - They are couple smart ass cops. Should be short and sweet. - Come on. - Oh. Would you come on? Trust me. Come on. Let's go. Now listen to me, while you are in here you stay down. - You know how to use a gun? - Yes. - OK. - But what about you? I'll be fine. Ok? Go. Come on. - Go. - Right. You are still my angel, Durand? No, but I can arrange for you to get one. - The real one. - Like you did for Art? I never wanted that to happened. I loved Art. You sure having a funny way to show it that, Captain. Look, he was on to me. There's too... good. Too self rightness. There was no way he was ever gonna let me slide. - So why the fires? - I lost everything. My life savings, everything. Do you understand? That means, to somebody at my age. Locals and insurance pay us to almost for fires. - I have nothing. - What do you have now? Lisa get back! Lisa! She... She came out... Risking her life for you. Something... I... never... figured. Subs: Ranko Jankovic 11/07/2017 Corrections: Kilo
