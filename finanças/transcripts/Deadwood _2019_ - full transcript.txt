Ten years gone, 'proaching that self-same hill I thought to lay me down and rise no more. Oof. Give wide berth! That's just passed wind! Possibly worse. Before eyes close for good and all... I'd once again see my Joanie Stubbs... show her a sign of... loving regret from Calamity Jane to her darling. And, too, at the grave of Wild Bill. Ooh. Oof, I've a left-cheek ass blister's a percolating son of a bitch. Good, right there. Morning, Boss! Get me the gimp. - Jewel! - What? Get up here. Have something on the stove, Al! Well, once you finish burning it, then. Ho, ho, ho. - Morning, Doc. - Morning, Al. Uh, at liberty... are you just now? Why, you wanna dance? What'd that be about? Fashioning into telephone poles. Ain't we got enough of them damn things already? Plan's to put lines in every business. Catch up with the times! Out of sorts, would you say, Commander? Half a stride short of fully fit. Light, somewhat, a few pounds. And some bit pallid, too. Ah, Jesus, just shoot me, Doc. Name the day of the week, Al. The fuck difference does the day make? I'd have you but say the name. Tuesday then, you half a scarecrow-looking cocksucker. Friday, it is. Oh. Mistaking Friday for Tuesday. Well, secure my burial plot. Well, your temperature's two degrees above normal, features drawn, flesh of a yellowish cast. Pending fucking developments... I'd have you forbear from spirits. - Under advisement. - Oh, no, no, no. Don't you humor me, nor talk down to me neither, nor fix to mix in where you ain't been invited. Whilst you comport the very like to me? You went somewhat wrong at your liver, Al, is what you've God damn done! Bar you being out-and-out blind, you already know he's ill. Minute past, words to Dan, "Boss is looking poorly. Out of sorts." Don't he look outta sorts, you goddamn donkey? He is to forbear from spirits of any kind, until he's assayed and diagnosed. You know he'll just endeavor to import spirits in off the street? Well, you're not to allow it! That's easier told than saddled and rode. Well then, go ahead and hang him, goddamn it! Blow his fuckin' head off! Save us all some time! Wrong side of the damn bed! Mrs. Ellsworth! Charlie Utter. Oh my. What a grand surprise after such a piece of time. For me, Mr. Utter, as well. Sofia! Come on! Am I past my place, Ms. Ellsworth, asking if it's banking brings you back these parts? Banking, yes. My interest in the Deadwood Bank, which is an expanding institution... Few years back, Mrs. Ellsworth, bad manners like that woulda lead to a lesson in courtesy! Continuing grateful for hard-won maturity. Sofia, a gentleman wishes to renew acquaintance, Miss. Charlie Utter saying hello to Miss Sofia. The 10 years went past like... - -somebody snapped their fingers. Hello back, Mr. Utter. - It's lovely to see you again. - Thank you. Hey, I'd be happy to convey you all into Deadwood camp in my wagon. As we would be for the transport, and your good company. Oh well, come on. I hope we're in time for the statehood celebration. - Go as quick as I'm able. - Hey, sweetheart. Help you with that luggage. Very kind, I'm okay. Well, I assume you'll be staying in town, darling. Pardon me. There a price we can offer for that information? You have me wrong. Oh, there you are! - Hello there. - Looking for a ride. I can pay. South Dakota marrying the United States. Oh! See, they're paying attention, Seth. - Morning, miss. - Morning, Papa. Bullock clan ready for the statehood festivities. Are you ready, husband, considering the visiting delegates include the senator from California? To celebrate, yes, I am. I'm tempted to believe you. Statehood pancakes coming out! Clear the way! All right, all right, little man. Single-minded, this boy, like his old man. A virtue in your estimation. Lord, bless these gifts we ready to receive, and grant us grace to meet level-headed what challenges may come this day... no matter the provocation by lesser or evil men. Amen. - Amen. - Amen. On this day - of our statehood celebration... - Hear, hear! ...we honor a man who with unexampled generosity has give of himself to our Deadwood community. Though no longer residing amongst us, he calls California now his home. The man bases his considerable mining and real estate interest here in Deadwood, South Dakota. I ask you please to greet with me now, the honorable junior senator from the great state of California, George Ambrose Hearst! - Good morning to all! - Morning, Senator! And great thanks to Mayor Farnum for his generous words of welcome. It moves me greatly, returning after years have passed to witness the changes wrought by time, ingenuity, and invention. - Though none would deny the facts - MARTHA: Excuse me. And the cost of a past, we who gather have known together... Some portion of which must still be measured in blood. Yet, the Deadwood community does enter its adulthood... And don't our spirits raise, you murdering, conniving, thieving cocksucker. Resourceful and resolute, a vital part of the new-made state of South Dakota, and this state a vital part of our fine country. Amen to that! Thank you, Senator! Hotel's but two rooms short of fully occupied, Trixie, with the parade yet still in full swing. Congratulations then, Mr. Star, to you and Marshal Bullock. Maybe mark the moment braining me with a fucking brick! I'd sooner put a ring on your finger. Once first we've seen does the baby survive. That being, in your scripture, matrimony's single reason and purpose. Ain't we already awash in the miracle of a whore of my vintage being pregnant at all? Well, why not wear a sign, then? Dress in red, head to toe? Please, Trixie. You oughtn't show your face outside. Lemonade's on its way with chips of ice, how you like. Rest now. I just got the fuck up. Rest. Senator! Senator! Murdering motherless cocksucker. Oh, Senator Hearst! Your honor! Yoo-hoo! On this 10th anniversary of them being butchered, I convey to you, Senator, memorial greetings from the miner Ellsworth and prostitute Jen. - But two of the who knows how many - BANDLEADER: Hold it! You've done for while making your moneyed progress! Have I missed word of your appointment to some position of authority? Have I missed word of yours, you bald-pated cunt?! Better watch yourself, Senator! Mr. Hearst? Oh. For ain't it so, sir. It's the thieving and throat-cutting, them's bloodied and dead in the mud, as still stiffens the member in your long-johns! Well, why not press forward, for Christ's sake? Set herself aflame? Nor, ought I fail to remark the semblance from this vantage twixt your very mug and a snatch has gone haired-over-sideways. Oh! Mayor Farnum! It's a... Trixie hasn't lost her gift. She ain't for a fact. Time can't touch that. ...letting this slimy cocksucker slither his way into our camp's inner workings! And aren't you the vile bodying of a gutter-mouth trollop and tramp! Go. - As you are of a murdering shitheel! - Now. Trixie! What's left still to do, Trixie? Pitch yourself down the stairs? End any chance of our child's well-being? Jesus wept! What is it? Something amiss, as you fuckin' foresaw. Ready for the doc we are? - Off you go then to fetch him. - Okay. I'll be good. Marshal! Mr. Utter! - Hello. - Hello, girls. - Greetings from Uncle Charlie. - Uncle Charlie! It's lovely to see you both again. Mrs. Bullock. I remember your reading lessons so well. Mrs. Ellsworth here and her daughter, they need a room. I told them best hotel in town's right there. Perhaps installing Mrs. Ellsworth in a suite would be the considerate thing for the hotel's owner to do? Yes, it would. Mrs. Ellsworth, was there a room available? Uh, it-it seems... we've secured the very last one. Must be my lucky day. I'll walk you upstairs. You, having so lived in recollection, Marshal, it is my considerable happiness to see you again. No less a happiness, Mrs. Ellsworth, than of seeing you for me. As a dream might come alive to draw a breath. Said overmuch. Vowed I wouldn't, but I absolutely knew I would. Why didn't you write of your arrival? Not sure. I see. I wonder, Mr. Bullock, if all unwitting... I may have done something to upset an apple cart. Not at all. It's a pleasure to see you both again. What? Nothing, Mama. Bullock! Hey, Marshal! - Just the man I was looking for. - Coulda warned me of Mrs. Ellsworth's return, Charlie. How the fuck, when I was surprised myself? Very least not deposit her in my goddamn hotel! Hey, if you're finished rapping my knuckles, I got some more manly matters to discuss. I'm all ears, Charlie. Hearst wants to buy my land. Dangling big paydays through third parties. He's coming today hisself. - Are you disposed? - My age, I'd... be a fool not to chew on it some. Which, uh, evidently, Bullock that looks away, scowling like he is, don't approve of. Utter's pal Bullock figures if Utter sold off his land, nothing for Utter to do but sit wondering, in that old saloon, why in hell he'd sold the thing he'd spent his life getting situated to buy and keep to work it himself? Hearst doesn't deserve your land, Charlie. Nor ought I either fail to bring to mind the bastard's disposition to foul play. Before negotiations commence, would I be out of place calling on Hearst myself? I wonder, too, might you procure me an infant's linen? And you don't make a friend a stranger, Charlie. Decline him walking beside you. Saying first, my being grateful and heartily appreciative, I'd hold with your friend best achieving his purposes toting his water hisself. Join us for dinner tonight. You amaze my boy pulling coins from your ears. Better trick would be me pulling Hearst's hundreds out my ass. Expect you 7:00, Uncle Charlie. Thanks, Bullock, for the lookout. Good morning, Miss Newly-Arrived! Might you be the establishment's operator? Named Al. Swearengen's the remainder, if you ain't overmuch gave pause to the various ins and outs. My name's Caroline Woolgarden, Mr. Swearengen, which I imagine don't slide easy off the tongue any more than yours does. Caroline Woolgarden, like butter. Come new to town in hope of renting one of your fine rooms. Oh... Ah... Shitbird in prospect. Would you excuse me, Miss Woolgarden? Ah, produce George Hearst Esquire, colossus of commerce, junior senator from California, who since our paths last crossed has went from strength to stronger strength still. Even as you name me, a figure to be reckoned with in this camp, Mr. Swearengen, I have been made this morning, more than somewhat, to look an incompetent. You, sir? An incompetent? Now, how would that ever be? These years now past, I'd have you recall my having been attacked. Shot, and near as not, done in by a whore, whose name, if I ever knew it, has now been lost to me. I dimly recall the matter. The nameless whore embarked on a program of vengeance, and, by God, she nearly brought off. Referring to her attempt to murder me. Not to pretty the picture. I have lived believing the matter had been settled. And I was satisfied in that belief. But now, I realize I was tricked. The whore you presented in the box was not the shooter at all. Ah, you're going for the long, larger-minded view, Senator. Which depends on running telephone lines across the claims. On recognizing common ground, bringing the future to it. A brief illustration of my point... Does brevity exist in your repertoire, sir? I am making an offer on Charlie Utter's land. Lumber for construction arrived this morning. Confident, are we? Back my bid for buying up Utter's property. Use your position in the town to sway others, and I will drop any counteraction against the whore. The pregnant whore who attacked me. Uncharacteristically straightforward, sir. Discover your deepest nature, Mr. Swearengen. Walk with the future. How'd that do you, Al? Good like it seemed? Best time to produce Trixie so I can sell her on silence as virtue. On it, Boss. That's it. Blow it out, just blow it out. Christ, Jesus, Mary, and Joseph! They're arrayed to support you, Ms. Trixie, but you're the one who's got to be pushing! Which don't I, in Christ, look to be doing, Aunt Lou? Dan Dority! Speaking for Al that needs words with Trixie! Trixie ain't receiving, hard as she's coming for home. If you'd just tell Al, we'll issue word... - Come on, come on. - ...from this quarter as we are fucking able! Okay. I hear you, Doc. One more push, Trixie. This is it. - Now, we doing something. - And... Now we doing it. Okay. See his business? You got a boy! A boy. Go ahead, and slap his backside. There we go. Oh, Trixie. Hello, Joshua. Lord keep you. Ms. Calamity Jane Cannary. Charlie Utter. Some putting odds up train bring you home in a box. I come to collect Joanie Stubbs. Oh, God. How would you, uh, describe the Stubbs woman's state of affairs? Not seeing her consistent, I... I say Joanie Stubbs' collecting her portion of gloom and dismay, just like any of us. Well, suppo... Suppose, Charlie... say a, a person had a interest in that situation, what, by your lights, would be a right way of broaching the subject? I'd maybe say... you been thinking of her, hoping... if ever she thought of you, her thinking would be friendly, too. Write me that down to repeat it, you cocksucker. You know what to say, Jane. What to do. I will stand you to a drink. Down it along with you, too, far as that goes. - One drink. - Fuck one drink. Go find your girl. Go get her. Pssh. I'd have a word, either with management, or just some girl ain't on her back just now, legs straight up in the air! If you want the boss, Joanie's upstairs. Oh? Busy? - I didn't see. - No, we didn't see. Jane Cannary come a-calling, Miss Stubbs. I'd be grateful if you'd hold your fire. Everyone got plenty of room? Seem to be making due. Why don't me and Deenie just get outta here, Joanie? We don't want no trouble. Well arrived, Jane. - Welcome home. - Go fuck yourself. Hold her soap! Considerable time since seeing you. Wasn't me setting off see the country, see the world. Weren't we sure as fuck done with each other back then? Not on none of my say-so. Well, go on. Say what you wanna say. Uh, just... surprised to find you back here is all. I'd be grateful keeping opinions to yourself concerning my whereabouts and purposes. You wanna brawl, we can do it. Brawling's unseemly, girl my age. Charlie Utter said you been better. Is that right? Charlie did? High on dope, as I suppose you'd have to be, consorting with them miserable cunts. New old damn shooter coming out. Believed the game shut down when she left the table. These placer acres that you own, Mr. Utter, captured my attention. Scouts you sent previous made that clear. People whose judgment I respect assay this property's market value at $3,500. Seems I'm the lone holdout on the path of progress. By way of abbreviating our back and forth and... maybe generating some good will, I'd go 500 above. Offer you... 4,000 even, cash money. My father taught his boy, uh, "beat hell into him" might maybe be more accurate, how if, uh, early enough on, you credited the settlements was coming, bought acres reasonable, developed 'em sensible, hung onto 'em until the market come right, of a day you might could wake up and find you made yourself a respectable investment. Forward thinking was your father then. And now, here's his boy to confirm his papa's prediction. Contrary-wise, man might could... come to certain special feelings. Partial, say, to a piece of ground. A river... bending through the forest like so. I decline your offer, Mr. Hearst, thanking you for your time and attention. My experience over time has come to be... customarily, I am he who starts a negotiation. Names its finish, too. Maybe getting mother-fucked this morning in the thoroughfare, by a woman in the bargain, has somewhat got your back up. Not the accolade you'd looked for out your return to fuckin' camp. Proffering that assessment, sir, is hardly your proper bailiwick. Far as that, I went and proffered it any-fuckin'-way. Any soul on the grounds bearing mortal likeness to a walrus, raise up your right hand or whistle. You, Tom Nuttall! Up with your right, or purse your damn lips and blow! Pitiful effort. Welcome home, Jane. 'Scription to propose. Tombstone above a casket. "On this spot... "Was Bill Hickok "foully slayed, "brains blown to bits... "by the coward Jack McCall! "'Neath this building, too, "days to come, "will rest the remains of "Jane Ardis Cannary, "known as Calamity to strangers, "and to Bill Hickok "as a very good friend. "At the place "of his sorrowful demise, "may Jane's spirit stand vigilante watch as in life she found herself unable." And to speak straightforward, Jane, you mortally installed and decaying 'neath this building don't strike me as a magnet for commerce. Because you're headless for business, Tom, and heedless and horse-faced to boot! - - Well, why not empty the graveyards? We'll spot corpses at the tables, needling the gloom overall. That's a rotten idea. Fuck yourself, Arty. What are you selling, Wu? Swedgin. You. He has medicine for you. Swedgin. Your color looks wrong. Mengyao, you for hire? Yes, Mr. Swedgin. Good. I want you to take this note to Sol Star to give to his lady, Trixie, over at the Bullock Star Hotel over the road there. - You got that? - How much will you pay me? Payment upon return, and job verified complete. Now go wait outside the door for your grandad. Oh yeah. Swedgin. Drink. Tea. You drink tea. No! No! I'll cut your chink throat for a "no," and pitch you off the balcony with the other one, seek health advice on the way down. Fuckin' Wu. Go on, get back to your fuckin' alley! Fuckin' tea, huh? Am I doing somethin' wrong? You gimme the fantods, you're so... favoring a girl who once worked here. Is she thick through the calf like me? She's pretty. She had the yellowest hair. Just the sweetest damn smile. She had a chip, she had... there, right there, like to drive a fella crazy. Me at least, anyway. Jen... her name was. And Jen move along? She, she did. Uh-huh. Moved on. Give you word where? Uh... I weren't telling you true, Caroline. She died. Jen did. Just poor luck... Caught in the middle of situation none of her fuckin' doing. "Exceptional sweet soul," Minister said. And he weren't wrong. Appears my job's in progress before we might even get to set down. Early uprising... longtime trial to me. More than an hour late is Charlie. Maybe I pressed too hard about Hearst. Perhaps he got involved catching' up with folks. I should feed the children. I'm gonna look out for Charlie. Evening, Marshal! Looking for Charlie Utter, Jane. I ain't seen him tonight. Do something for me? Check around town. If you find Charlie, tell him my wife's angry at his bad behavior. - Count on it! - Harry, with me. My gout's agitating. - Should I take one of the young ones? - Yes, sir. - I'll fucking go with you, Bullock. - No! No! I'm up! I'm up. That's Charlie's horse. Start over there. Careful now! How long you standing out here? Better part of my fuckin' life, feels like. You looking for Charlie Utter with me or not? He sometimes plays cards at this new place. Only knowed that 'cause I teased him never frequentin' this joint. Lead the way then. Charlie? Charlie Utter! Charlie! Come out, hands where I can see 'em. Don't you shoot. What are you doing out here, Samuel? I'm just reachin' for my fishing pole, and I'm askin' you not to kill me. Christ. Charlie! It weren't me, no sir! What the fuck you talkin' about? Bullock! Jesus God in Heaven. Get him a blanket, Harry. - I didn't do it, Marshal... - Be still. I'd appreciate Mr. Hearst knowing I'm Waitin' to talk to him. - Mr. Utter! - That can't be! You see? Covered in blood! Charlie Utter's dead, Mr. Hearst. Murdered. Do we know by whose hand, Marshal, Mr. Utter has been taken? Who pulled the trigger, put the fucking money up to get it done. I take that, sir, as a slur meant to incite me. And I do not choose to be provoked. Your imputing foreknowledge, sir, to me of Mr. Utter's murder exposes me to shameful slander and disesteem. I will have you recant. Or either ready to receive behavior from me in rebuke. What form then do you figure your rebuke will take, murdering cunt that you are? - Bullock... - I'll get to you in a fuckin' minute. Charlie Utter. - - Have a thought for a good man dead. Shut the place down. Bar's closed! Go on, get the fuck outta here! I'd learn the import of that look passed twixt you and fuckin' Hearst. Get the marshal a whiskey. I don't want a fuckin' drink. Say, Bullock, a fella, not many hours left to order his affairs, applied them that remained, naming such purposes that he'd give primacy. Deal me in or don't, Al. I'd not be fucked halfway up. Hearst stopped by, wanted to bury the hatchet. Pool revenue and influence in exchange for Trixie's life. Planning to run telephone wires across Utter's property. Lumber lies at his claim. Him conveying that to you, you said fuckin' what? - I let the offer sit. - To what fucking end? You ever think, Bullock, of not going straight at a thing? No. What's the move, Al? Wish the fuck I knew. Killing Charlie Utter changes the game. Say the man has an eyewitness to bring to bear. Name him. Samuel Fields. The Nigger General was an eyewitness to what? Eyewitness to them as did for Charlie Utter. And thereby need a good fuckin' murdering. Sidestepping legal administration. Well, if it ain't for Hearst to follow the law, why the fuck should it be for you? Now, how should I construe that look on your mug, Bullock? My job ain't to follow the law, Al. My job is to interpret it, then enforce it... accordingly. You best counsel your partner proper, the safety of mother and child. Sol and me'll see to it. Hearst won't take long before he honors the rigors of his putrid fuckin' nature. He'll want an answer. I'll deliver your fuckin' answer. Fuckin' telephone in my joint. Saloon is a sanctuary. Every man worth the name knows the value of being unreachable. Will you have me suck your prick now, Mr. Swearengen? What has changed since early when I declined the offer? Do I look suddenly robust, unimpededly erect? I am out, as I told you, of sorts, commission, activity. And more and more forgetful what the whole sordid fuckin' business is to signify. Plenty I wouldn't mind forgetting. Hey, come over here. Come on. You dropped this earlier. Real or not, I value it high. That is a goddamn gold commemorative worth 12 to $14. Can I ask who the woman was earlier today, yelling from the hotel balcony? One who ain't afraid to die. And who you'd see live? Well, that's the question. When I'm gone, who'll protect her? Can the Jew do what needs to be done? Can Bullock? Oh Christ, save me. Have I feelings for her? Am I that fuckin' lost a cunt, a man my age? Makes me wanna weep, how you remind me of my dad. Don't you hang your relations around my neck. It's a sad night. Something's afire. Christ. I do have feelings. Hyah! Hyah! Hup! Charlie Utter. So much to rounding up Trixie for me. Well last night, you sent little Wu with a notion to abstain! Did I now? Doc is not 100% all the way to the top persuaded that you oughta be up and about just yet. Doc's got a call to his own fuckin' opinion, but not to be blabbin' about what pertains or ain't to my fuckin' plans, huh?! Fucking drenched. Oh! What are you doing up, Al?! Well, this is fucking pain in the balls. Jesus Christ! I owe Charlie Utter a sending off, Doc. Oh, goddamn it, Al. Okay. Hey, Dan! You do it, huh? Handful of dirt from each of us? Charlie Utter. You got to walk it ♪ by yourself ♪ ♪ There's nobody else... ♪ Mr. Utter's accustomed to letting me cross his land and fish the stream that separates his acres from Mr. Hearst. He come 'round about a quarter past the second I caught, me expecting his purpose to ask how I was faring. I heard a rifle shot, and took the fuck off. Could you identify the man who did it? No, sir, I cannot. Because I didn't see him. You being you? Me being the color I am, yes, sir. I wish I could. I'ma say this once to you, Marshal. I'm gonna let myself hope that you don't permit 'em stringing me up over something I had nothing to do with, not fuck all. Nobody's trying to lynch you at this moment here, Samuel. And if you look at me hard, you'll know they'll have to kill me down the road before they get to do it then. Bless you seeing clear to say so, Marshal, and get me a good goddamn lawyer. Sorry for the lateness. Gout's flaring. Was at the Doc's. Been hearing about your gout a lot lately, Harry. Pokes me like devil's in there working with a tiny pitchfork. How's this going? Get me a good goddamn lawyer, Marshal! ♪ I was standing on the banks ♪ ♪ Of the river ♪ ♪ Looking out ♪ ♪ Over life's ♪ ♪ Troubled seas ♪ ♪ When I saw ♪ ♪ An old ship ♪ ♪ That was sailing ♪ ♪ Is that the old... ♪ Come on, Jane. Time for Charlie's burial. Remember when Bill passed? Charlie so broke up he'd been out the camp, couldn't attend the goodbye? And I recollect, too, girl barely could put one foot front the other but weren't gonna fail to see Bill Hickok off. When Sol Star and I came to this community, Charlie Utter... was first man forward offering his hand in greeting. Over time, Sol and I formed a... friendship with Charlie. Enriched our lives. Come up to proper, he was good-natured and just. Come to any way at all, I never saw a man stand him down. Only right he should be buried on the land he worked his life for. Charlie was took from us wrongful, and he was... He was took too soon. We ask respite for a good man's soul. Pray the Lord carry him home. No man never stood up for me how Charlie did, nor with no word 'bout doing it, neither. Amen. Amen to that. Gentlemen. Senator Hearst expecting us. Room number nine. Constituents of the cocksucker from California? Don't I deserve common courtesy? May I mention service as this community's mayor, albeit admittedly a largely titular position. But, facts are facts. Well deserved, if modest, recognitions, gentlemen. Jobs well done. Well, if you call them recognitions just modest, Mr. Hearst, I pray to Christ we run across you the day you're showing off. Certain you were unseen? Not a human eye for miles. Man looks to be losing his mind, Dennis. - That direction. - What the fuck? Hm. I saw a fisherman at the claim earlier in the day. Dark-complected fellow, wading the stream. You bring me to wonder aloud if that last was a bald-faced fabrication. My sources say Marshal's collected a witness, for a fact. I paid for execution at a level of professional excellence. You were commissioned... to undertake of certain effort. It went without saying that you would address any complications that might ensue. Part of the contract, sir, yes. They have someone in custody, which fails, by a considerable margin, to please me. I strongly suggest you handle it. How the fuck are we supposed to get into the marshal's office? Check on the veracity of this claim? My sources are to be trusted, it won't be easy. But, neither will it be impossible. Uh-huh. I see. This further business, if successfully brought to fruition, will earn each of you... $50 additional. Well, now we're talkin'. - The Negro fisherman? - That'd be a job well done. Judas Priest! A word with you, Mr. Farnum! Property of mine fell victim to arson last night. So, Senator, I'm gave to understand. What dreadful news. Place this lumber order. The vendor is in Lead. Tell the man weekly deliveries until further notice. By telegraph, sir? There is a public telephone just outside. Take the leap, Mr. Farnum. The future awaits. The queue, sir, stretches. Have you seen the riffraff lined up? Stall progress he may. Stop it he cannot. Every business, Mr. Farnum, in this territory thrives as a direct result of communication. Now, we've no say as to the pace of modernity's advance. I myself am merely... its vessel. A humble foot soldier. Its inevitability is the deepest truth... What is wrong with you, goddamn it, to be shifting your feet so incessantly? Uh, the procession of years, wanton leakage. You are a vile creature. Nor are you first to say so. Get the hell out and place the call. I'll detain you for the briefest moment. - Now. - Yes, sir. Going. Peaches, Jewel, are for meeting of the town elders. This prospect here before us, it's an auction. It's hardly the same fuckin' thing. God, you think about ever getting yourself a hobby, Dan? And that smart-ass mouth of your'n is gonna get you relegated back to the fucking kitchen. Futile to go to Hearst this way. No matter his resources, but it'd be a pity not to recognize what's at stake. To go ahead and die stupid. Hate to end a fool, right? Sure as hell Charlie Utter didn't. What's essential is you remember, do your part. Oh, naught else, Marshal? Laundry required? I'll let you know. Where you been, Bullock? Right up the fuckin' road, Al. God damn it! Goddamn it. My goodness. A voice? Hello, in there. I'm calling the town of Lead! It's Deadwood's mayor, E.B. Farnum, relegated to magnate-Senator George Hearst's errand boy, calling Lead Lumber at the senator's behest. The Negro will lay slain before this concludes. Christ. I must get to Bullock. Good afternoon and welcome to the Utter estates dispersal, as will proceed under the supervision of the Deadwood Bank. A description of the parcel and its dimensions are detailed in the available literature. First bids on landholdings of Charlie Utter, Deadwood Bank the fiduciary, to commence at $2,500, increments thereafter of $100 above the previous bid. I'm not made for such complexity. Who will open now on parcel one at $2,500? I've a bid for $2,500 on the regrettably deceased Mr. Utter's very desirable property. Who will go with me now to 26? - $2,600. - Backing your play, partner. Conservative proffer. Uh, $2,700. Upon which Hearst takes matters by the neck. 3,000. Nor do I lack for stronger opinions. - 3,100. - 32. Rode in, did you, Marshal, on a Trojan horse? Floor's heard $3,200. 3,300, please. 34. And if you know your limit, Marshal, let's hurry and get to it so that I may get us past, and that we all of us can sup at a decent hour. 3,400's heard once. 3,500. Terrible fire at your claim last night. Everybody whole, - Senator? - 36. 3,700. 38. 3,900. I've 3,900 once. Mr. Hearst sent us. It's fuckin' daytime. Not our fuckin' problem. Say how you want it played. Key's on the desk, this side of my head. - 4,300. - 44. - Seth... - Do I hear 4,500? 5,000, goddamn it. As ought shoo the sightseers off. - 5,500. - 56. 6,000. 6,500. $7,000. 7,200. $7,300. And neither, if you continue, sir, will you find yourself unaccompanied. I've $7,300 for the Utter property heard once. 7,300 twice. Third time. Sold to the distinguished and resourceful Mrs. Ellsworth, for $7,300! Mrs. Ellsworth. You honored Charlie today. Bullock! Excuse me. What is it, E.B.? - You're certain? - Yes. Dan. - With Al. - Staying. No! Oh! Sorry. How long ago? I couldn't tell you for a mortal truth. - They got Samuel. - Marshal! Come! Something bad is happening! Come! Come! Come here! Lemme go, the chink lives. Mengyao! Mengyao! You're gonna die you do that. You arresting me for beating a coon murdered a decent white man? - You murdered Charlie Utter. - Aye? And who says so? I... I say so. That's him, Bullock. Killed your friend. Seth. Seth! Seth! Don't kill him! Take care of Samuel. Wu, feed that fuck to the pigs. George Hearst! Come out! George Hearst! Come out now! Identify the man hired you to do Charlie Utter's murder. Finally lost your grip, Marshal. Name the man! Go on! Point him out. He hired us. Who did? Set up, Marshal, are we? Justice and mercy in proper relation. Feelin' more a man? Better lock the next shipment of lumber up. I expect you believe a badge insulates you from certain untoward consequences. Much as your being a US senator will insulate you from jail. Tell this cocksucker to lower his weapon! Inside, now. Fuckin' shot, I am! You'll fuckin' live. Johnny... Congratulations on the rising body count. Ain't proud of it. I'm coming for you, Marshal. Expect you will, Senator. Mr. Hearst? Hold your son. Rock him towards sleep. Feed him his milk I've squoze into his bottles. Clean and change him when he does his business. Wait, Trixie, where are you going? First, Al's urgent call to see me. Then, he sends this note sayin' the opposite. What the fuck, Sol? Not mine. Collateral damage is all. Well, whose fucking blood is it? Men who murdered Charlie, dead now. - Oh, the Hebrew takes to arms! - Trixie, please calm down. Then, take him. - No. - For God's sakes. I'm getting Al's counsel. With our baby stood with his father, 20 possible minutes or a fucking cunt hair more. I'll exit back of the hotel, sneaky as a mouse, and enter the Gem a side way. Being stupid and fuckin' reckless. As I may be both, you Jew bastard, to get out the fuckin' door. Beatin' you about head and shoulders, lad? Their's the upper hand just now. Some choice, making your presence known to Hearst. Whatever trouble I caused... blame the baby's imminent arrival. I took that young girl's life to save yours. Please, Al, don't say it again. Haunts me, Jen's face does. Weren't you cut her throat, nor devised a fuckin' plan that nearly got us all killed. God have mercy on me. I don't deserve the one fuckin' minute of happiness, my newborn gave me coming into the world. We chose you, you loopy cunt. Look at the fuckin' mess you've give us. I'm un-fucking-worthy, Al! I belonged in that coffin, not her! Well, if your aim was to die, please, allow me to do the honors. We're all of us haunted by our own fucking thoughts, so make friends with her ghost! It ain't going fuckin' anywhere! I'm sorry... for everything. Heavens open up. She expresses contrition. New baby in camp? Lovely little boy. As born of his mother, he would be. Did you try and stop her from leaving? - Nothing I could do. - Jesus Christ. Swearengen's the only one I told Samuel's in the cage. Man may be a lot of things, but he's not a snitch. State he's in, more likely fuckin' forgot the conversation entirely. Too much ask you stay the hell outta trouble? No, fuckin' Bullock. Not too much. I will. Not himself, Al weren't. Weak like I never seen him. Gather some things now. We're spending the night at the Bullock house. Moving us from the center of town. Hate runnin' from him, Sol. For our boy. What are the odds him comin' to? He's severely injured from the beating. Spleen's ruptured. Blood in his belly. Odds on it ending? All bleeding stops eventually. We ought marry on the morrow, Sol. Al ain't to be relied on to linger. And we ain't exchangin' secret fuckin' vows, tucked away in hiding. Free all day. Oh, well done. Proud performance. Fuckin' pissed myself. Twenty minutes going forward to the ceremony, nor neither the same interval afterwards. No fornication on the premises. Why does she get to hold him? Because I'm the bride, and it's my special fuckin' day. Lend fucking hands, girls! Make the place presentable. May make that girl my wife. She ain't gonna marry no man age enough to be her daddy. Soft hands smoothed my brow. Wrist smelling like jasmine. She sewed the hole in my shoulder closed with needle and thread, mm-hmm. Lift your wallet while she's doing it? That's a dark view of the world, Dan. I ask to be enlightened as to the passage of spirit in prospect for me, Doc. Well... I take us to be collections of cells, each aggregate a smaller, separate life inside us, and... and time slows. And finally stops. The fate my cell collections live into as we speak. That ain't so to a mortal certainty, Al. I'd not prolong the chewing up, Doc, nor the being spat out. Not go out a cunt. It's the dispatch I find inglorious. The whole delusory fucking self-importance. - Is it your hope to attend the wedding? - It's my resolve. All right then. Pucker up. I'll take him. Believe you were born to be a whore? Probably doing what I'm fit for. How hard you suppose the bastard turned you out had to work to make you think that? Trixie. Got an appointment upstairs. Oh, well, I hope you're proud, expelling your sneeze in my mug. That's the Lord's blessing come upon you, Al. That's him leanin' down to kiss your cheek. Yeah. Well, I ain't got no time left for fancy dancin'. Your thoughts on me leaving you the joint? No, not being either to say you have to run women. I strongly endorse that. Make it a dance hall for all of me. What about the circus elephants, Al, producing some novel effect? Dance hall, Trixie, ain't a bad idea. Good man you got there! Heart, soul, and brains enough to know that he struck lucky in his female companion. Good example for the kid to emulate. And no fee for the sermon. Excuse me now. Hey. Maybe you oughta think about running for office? Outnumbered, as we are, by shit-birds. Food for thought, Mr. Swearengen. That idea is my wedding gift to you. Thank you. Heard you was down here. This one was Charlie's. Yours now. Sure he'd want that. Past when I took what Cy gave me, I'd pray I wouldn't wake up. You gutless cunt. Don't you speak that way to me again. Nor neither am I saying I feel that way now, is my point. You... gimme a goddamn kiss and say, "I promise I won't fold, no matter how sad I get." Or just don't say a word at all then. Just go ahead and give me a kiss and don't say a word. Oh. All right. Well... you bring to recollection you're a hell of a good kisser. And you're still chewing that licorice? That's my 12th least-worst sin. Time comes, I have $14,057 in the mattress, which you will divide equally. You fight amongst yourselves, you will wish there was no hell because I will surely come back and cut your fuckin' throats. - Well, I don't want your money. - Yeah... There. Gentlemen... can we not appear as quadruplets? Bless you for being upright, for letting me have my hand on your arm, and for being the showing-up sort that you are. What's else is gravy. Safe passage to us all. Oh, you're a picture, miss. - Means something. - Mm-hmm. Three times I go around? Always coming back. I ain't gave to flight. Righteousness. Loving kindness. Justice. For all in my ignorance, I, uh, do not hew to the letter of, uh, its practice, but I'd hope the brief ceremony will be respectful to... Jewishness! Level best, Reverend! A for effort. Eh, bless you, my son, and thank you for understanding. Sermon's over. That's all! I'll now ask the young Miss Sofia to come forward with the nuptial rings. By the powers of each of their religions and practices, I now pronounce Sol and Trixie man and wife. Should your husband kiss you? Lest he be sleepin' outdoors. Been thinking, Jane. Maybe I'd like to see the world. For instance, what's France like? Don't know. Never wanted to see it till this minute. Happy occasion. Papa! Are you all right? Let's... figure out what to do with that land. Ah, Jesus, Mary, Joseph, and all risen saints. For once in your life, resist the urge for utterance. As witness before my newborn child my hope in beginning again, I pray we forbear from fucking up each other's lives further, and live in peace and quiet. It seems to me, Mrs. Star, in coming forward to conciliate me, you consign yourself to a misery not unlike a sort of... execution. These two gentlemen are sheriff and deputy from a neighboring town, brought in to represent my interests. Sheriff Laraby from Lead. - We have a warrant for the arrest of Trixie Star - for the attempted murder of Mr. George Hearst. You get the hell outta here. Forbear, son, lest you be undone. I'm not your son, no more than you're the boss of the fuckin' future. Why, I believe I am its whole inheritor. These men have no jurisdiction here. I'm guessing these two you brought don't know the extent of your crimes here. Prime suspect in the murder of Charlie Utter. Are you going to incarcerate me again, Marshal Bullock? This time, for how many minutes? Let's find out together. - Little tight on my wrist. - Shut up. Come through my town, you stop at the marshal's office first. Way a fellow lawman would do, showing any fuckin' respect. Sorry for the interruption. Carry on with the celebration. Smile, Senator Hearst! - Get him outta here. - Good riddance! 'Fore you lock him up, no harm you letting us have a word with Mr. Hearst. Speaking for Charlie Utter, as is gone from amongst us. What's going on here? What's in train? This United States of American Senator... had Charlie Utter murdered! - Yeah! He's a murderer! - Without remorse! - Nor recourse! - Can't hide behind that! Nor fucking recollection! I'll tear your head clean off, boy, if that'll help recollection. Who heaves something next gets dealt with. - You entitled motherfucker! - Son of a bitch. Steer your people, Marshal. - Shut the fuck up! - Cocksuckers! Nobody answering no one! - Do what-all they want! - You got that right! Go on now! Go! Go. - Easy! - What the hell? Come on, let us finish it. Leave him be. My God... Lest I arrest every one of you. I've seen enough. Ah! Get the fuckin' Doc. Oh yeah, let's do allay the cocksucker in his misery. Now, Jane! Hope you die in the street. Like my dad did! Go on home, now! You son of a bitch! Have you finished your impotent display? No, I don't believe I have. You're my witness, Senator. Marshal's trying to kill you. Coward was coming behind you, Bullock. 'Bout to shoot you back the head. Jane! You son of a bitch, Harry. That was Bill come into me. Him come to protect us. No, Jane. That was you. The Good Book, Marshal... says... the Lord chooses amongst His witnesses... them'd be thought least likely. Is that so? You might should oughta know... before what happened... Mr. Utter... seemed to me... a different man. Like a weight had come off his shoulders. What else they say about the Lord's witnesses? What else? Their defects... notwithstanding, they testify to His wond'rous glory. Singing, he was, at the end, Marshal, 'bout walking the valley. Joyful to hear and behold. Singing. If you have it in you to abide, I'd not have you leave me. I won't, Al. Comes to it, Jewel and me will see to you. I'll have the little one brought in. I heard you singing the other day. I thought you'd stabbed a frog. If you want, Al, I can rub your feet. Shaky hands, but it works well. Go ahead then.
