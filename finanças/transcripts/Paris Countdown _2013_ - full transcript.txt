Where did we meet before? Our club in Paris. Le Sound, by the river. That's it. Nice place. What do we do now? I don't give a shit. Enjoy the landscape while you're here. What the hell? Stupid assholes. PARIS COUNTDOWN Finally. I thought you'd changed your minds. Can't say we didn't want to. Need I remind you how much you owe? No need. A bite to eat? Raw fish at 6 a.m. isn't our thing. Delicious. Still... no surprise Japanese culture is too subtle for you. You prefer late-night steaks, nonstop hookers, getting plastered. It's your father who taught us that. My dad is dead. His vision of nightlife too. The night's changed. And it may not be good news for you. What's your solution? The same one Milan agreed to. You agreed to this? I made choices. For us. I'll be back in 5 days. I won't let you go. Milan, are you in? I committed to this. He's not in. Stop, Victor. It's fine. No, it's not. We sell soda, not drugs. The only drug I know is money. And you're in withdrawal. Why don't you go, if it's so important? He bailed out. Neglecting his old man's business. You owe him money. And he owes us. We all stand to gain. Why make it hard? Meet José and Etienne. It's their contact. Deliver the dough, get a tan, and no more debts. You're like mailmen. It's not... Not what? You were bawling when Serki called. That psycho who collected debts in Paris 10 years ago? He's calmed down since. It's the sun. Let's go. This isn't for us. What the hell? Change of plans. You go and we keep your pal. How's that? Unless you go too. Don't move! Move it, asshole! Wake this prick up! Talk, asshole! Talk! Victor! We nabbed your pal Serki. You'll testify to send him away. Understand? I don't know... Work him over! Talk! We wrote your statement! Sign it! Hear me, motherfucker? I don't understand! As you wish. Leave him the fuck alone! Sign it! Get it now, asshole? Enough! Spare us! Spare us. Let me help you, Victor. Let me help you. Don't ever come near me again. You hear? Never again. Six years later Serki... You're crazy. You seem at peace when you nap. I'd have sent someone to pick you up. Where are Milan and Victor? Milan vanished. Ever since he heard you got out. Impossible to get hold of. Must be hammered somewhere. Can I get dressed? - Not comfortable like this? - I'm modest. Fuck your modesty. Where are the assholes you sent 6 years ago? Paris is small. We'll find them. I have an idea. When I went to Mexico, it wasn't just for business. I wanted to retire. Live in the sun. Even start a family. Find myself a girl. Have some kids. And that was before you took over your father's business. Before the slammer. These machines are very fragile. Listen up. From now on, I hold you responsible for what happened to me. A lot has changed since you left. Nightlife too. I've had to adapt. I have investors. I answer to them. Just keep your mouth shut. Don't bullshit me. Tomorrow the sun will rise and... all this will be behind us. Remember José and Etienne? Very well. They remember you too. They'll stay with you till we find your ballerinas. What are you looking for? Cigarettes. You've quit for 6 years. Is it worth it? I don't know. Not really ready to see Milan? Not really. I have no choice. Serki's release concerns us all, not just you! - You think of the kids? - Sure I do. That's all I do. Empty words! That's all I have, for now. As for the rest... you'll have to trust me. Later, guys. Don't stay up late. You disappear. For two days. You were supposed to take the girls! Now you tell me to leave town? You're out of your mind! - It's different, I promise. - Promise? Promise what? What can I expect from an ex who fucked half the city? Can't you see I'm serious? You're serious when it suits you. Coralie, I'm asking you to take the kids. Go to your mom's. Please. Don't bother changing. Leave us alone. Yes, Victor. I'm here. Is he there? Yes, in his room. I just spoke to him. Room 117. Stay with him. Don't let him go. Okay, I understand. They're on the way. He's in the hotel, 100% sure. I hope your math got better. We're going to be right. [knocking] It's Victor. How's it going? I'll call you. Mid-life crisis? My problem is not that I'm 50. It's that I'm not 30 anymore. Weren't we never going to meet again? Wasn't Serki never going to get out of jail? His pals in the cartel pulled strings. Serki is like having crabs. He won't let go. And hiding out, getting smashed will shake him off? We have to see Wilfried. He'll talk to Serki. For his father's sake. What's Wilfried going to do? There will be blood and that brat won't be spared. You've always pampered me. Haven't you? See you in the bar. Take a shower. You really could use one. Don't worry. You got nothing to blame yourself. We've always gotten by. Right? You think we're getting by? Once I thought it possible. That we'd squeeze through. Not anymore. Now I know we'll be paying big-time. Can you stop that? Tell me something. I don't get why you called. You left me alone with the club, never answered the phone. Six years without even a phone call. Why did you call me? Why tonight? Serki is both our problem, whether I want it or not. I didn't want to see you, given the circumstances. I thought that maybe it was a sign. How's the restaurant? Not bad. Less of a hassle. That's what you wanted. Let's go see Alex at Le Sound. I hired her after you left. She has a solution. You'll see the work I had done. It's doing well. Bad idea. They'll be expecting you there. Exactly. We'll know right away. We have to stay here.Think things over. Drinks are on me. Another round. Hold on. We started off together. And we'll end up... the same. Hello, Milan. Your appointment's here. Tell him I'll be late. Don't make a scene. Come with us. We won't be long. We're not going to fight here. Are we? Tell me it all went well. Then I won't insist. No, it didn't go well. This way! Ran off with Victor? Yes, ran off with Victor. I'll kill that bastard. I can't anymore... Sink his houseboat with a fucking rocket launcher! Just get this over with! What did he say? The usual bullshit. I can't stand that prick anymore. I think it's mutual. It didn't take them long to find us. I have to quit smoking. If that's the only solution you find... we won't get through tonight. Even if we do, what's going to happen tomorrow? Come on. This is a real chick magnet. What make is it? We have to go see Alex at the club. No smoking. Pain in the ass. Why the hell go to your club? They expect us there. They won't ever get in. I mean Serki. What about him? Let him come. I'm waiting. You don't listen to me. You've never listened. There's no discussing. Like clapping with one hand. Your seat belt. And Coralie? I guess it's over. It lasted 15 years. It's not bad. I can't get upset. She's a good girl. And there are the kids. When I think about it, it kills me. They're 7 and 14, right? Good memory. Your boys? Andrea is 13. Sacha's almost 8. I'm quite a godfather! Kids aren't stupid, like us. They don't hold grudges. Why? Do you hold grudges? Sometimes. But I figure if I spent so many years with you, you can't be rotten to the core. Yeah, maybe. Maybe. How you doing? Hey, Freddy. - Busy? - Music and booze... Two guys are tailing us. One's all bloody. Holler if they come. - See you later. - Night, boss. So? Guillaume! What's up, girls? Having fun? Victor, Geraldine... He's my best friend. Fleur, two. Don't be a pain. Come on... Pain in the ass! I left you tons of messages! I needed to think. I look for solutions and you're out thinking! Hello, Victor. I wish you'd reunited in other circumstances. So do we. How do you like the club? You did an amazing job. I was right to step aside. The plane's in 3 hours. What do you mean? Don't start. Tomorrow you'll be in Bangkok. I have friends there with a nice club on the beach. They need a guy like you, experienced. I can't just leave. You crazy? Listen to her. She may be right. Thanks, guys. You two won't be on the run, freaking out at every noise, every new face. I won't be safe while he's alive. Want to shoot him? He survived a Mexican prison. You're no killer. I know guys who are. I can pay what it takes. You mean the Turk and his psychos? I get nauseous in the suburbs, let alone Asia. 50 is a little late to start over, isn't it? Time for one last drink. Just one. It's José. We're here. In front. We can't miss him. Good going, guys. I'm coming. A Hemorrhage? Is that a new drink? Stop drinking too? I know this may sound wild... Tomorrow Sarah won't be home. I'm watching the kids. Playing hardball now. Relax for a minute. Can you? What kind of poison you use? Only the best. Strawberry or blackcurrant syrup. Vodka, bison grass is best. Beer, Belgian for purists. Some Chablis, preferably chilled. When do we go to ER? One won't kill you. But a guy I know had a stroke after 10 of them. To your new life. Those dicks are here. You should go home. With 6 bouncers plus Freddy, we'll be fine. What's the plan now You were expecting this. Should I see to them? Let's not be rash. Full house. We'll lie low. What do you mean, lie low? What are you doing? It was your idea. You steer. Are you crazy? I'm smoking. I can't do both at once. Brings back memories... What? You remember... I know what you're thinking. Those two Spanish girls. What were their names? Carmen and... Penelope. Remember? You promised them a ride in the boat. Did I promise to capsize it? That was me. You had stronger arms then. I love this fucking city. We're here. The guys are still there. No clue. Thanks, Freddy. It's right there. Now that's a car. Driving gloves included? You moron... get inside. It sure is pretty but we look like two old farts. Won't be the first time. I thought this might help. I have to get back.... Good luck. I get it. Get what? See their faces? A breadknife won't do. You've lost your mind. It's out of hand. It got out of hand 6 years ago. Time to rein it in. It's all yours. Take care of it. Remember when my dad gave me his? When you got your license? "Like Giscard" he said. I guess he found Giscard classy. We looked cool when we took it for a ride. What did the bouncers call us? The presidents. Where is Milan? I don't know how to prove it... but I swear he left. He left the country for good. He left. You two are very close. He ever fuck you? We worked together. That's all. That's not like him. He's getting old. Would he be sad if you got hurt? Yes. I think so. Glad to hear it. I want Coralie and the kids at her mom's. Since I asked, she won't go. Just to piss me off. I'll stop by. It'll be nice to see the girls. Two pretty little princesses. I bought them a horse. They're crazy about it. They prefer the horse to me now. You'll come back. If only just for them. They'd be better off with a real father. Who tucks them to bed, walks them to school. Who doesn't smell a sewer... That guy's not me. What will you do? Protect Sarah and the kids. I don't know how, but... I'll manage. Once I was ashamed to be indecisive, to shut my mouth and go with the flow. That's over. Now I choose. Life's all about choices. Excuse me, sir. It's your turn. Go on. Okay, okay. - What? - Alex and Freddy are dead. It's Serki. How do you know? My bouncers recognized the motherfucker! I'm calling the Turk. Leave or they'll kill you! Keys! - Hear me? - The keys. Want to die? Is that it? So die! I don't want to. If for once you can't admit you're wrong, take your night ride alone. Victor, stop! Stop, godammit! What do you want? That I get down on my knees? It's hard... Hard to talk without cracking jokes. What should I say? That I feel like shit whenever I think of Mexico? That not a... a night goes by when I don't want to die? You want to hear that? It could be a good start. We need to protect each other. Give me a shot to make up for it. Trust me, one last time. Please. Why do you think the Turk will agree to help you? He'd kill his own mother if the price is right. But Serki isn't his mother. If the Turk refuses, we go straight to the cops. I promise. I'll drive. Why? Because you smoke. You can't do two things at once. Not answering? It must be Sarah worrying. If she's worried, answer. I'll call her back. You've reached Victor. Leave a message. Are you fucking me over? What the hell? Call me. No fucking way! I thought you were dead. Not yet. I left a message for the Turk. He told me. Follow me. Have a drink... I'll tell him. We're in a rush. Relax, Victor. Enjoy yourself. Family guys like you go over big here. Stop feeling me up. Stay here. I'll hurry. Let's go back to the airport. What do you think? Safer bet. It'll go fine. End of the hall on the left. The rest room? By the stairs. I'll have another. This is the Turk. Message after the beep. Sorry, Milan. I had no choice. Goddamn motherfucker! How could the Turk have done this? Fucking bastard! How could he? Okay? Understand now? We'll go to the cops. Is all of Paris is against us? I'll drop you off at home. Leave with your family. Don't stay home, okay? - I'll call them. - Who? What are you doing? Start! Start, dammit! Start! Talk to me! Come... I'll help you. Let me help you. Now can you hear me? Can you? It's been ages since you came by the house. Sarah would be happy to see you. She often mentions our evenings with Coralie. Partying all night long... We had good times. We had good times. I got older and you refused to grow up. So it got hard to spend time with you. Wait for me here. I'll find another way out. Okay? I got him. No, in the park. Near a pond. Come around back. I couldn't wait to see you. I can't say the same. Not human, that mouth of yours... Enough! You killed him. Drop it... Fuck. We have to go now. They're on their way. Hurry. Don't move. Wait here. Hurry up! Excited? Feel like you got balls now? He almost wasted us! After me, he'd have bled you dry. So no more soul-searching! And don't talk to me like a moron! I don't know. It's terrible but... you don't get it... If we go to the cops, they'll cut us a plea bargain. You're a lawyer now? Forget the cops. See how we live? We won't last a day in jail! Go on... Tell me what's eating you so we can move on. Tell me! You're a dirty bastard. You have been for 40 years. Is this how it ends between us? Two idiots on a sidewalk? Look what's become of us. Look at us. Tell me what you see. A guy with a short memory. It's thanks to my club you bought your restaurant and put your kids in school. It wasn't worth it? No, Milan... - It wasn't. - What are you doing? - We're not sticking together? - Beat it! You're a pain in the ass! You're a fucking pain! You hear? Stop! Stop it! Damn... You fought back less when we were kids. That's not it. I used to let you win. So you wouldn't be disappointed. It seemed... so important to you. Where are you going? Neuilly, please. This is how clubs are run nowadays? Barefoot from a living room? Mind if I smoke? I'd rather not. What's going on? Why don't you answer my calls? I changed my mind. I let Milan leave. He's in a plane as we speak. What was that? You heard me right. I work it out with Serki to spare you and your family, and you decide to let Milan walk? You giving up on life? What's up? Why fall apart when we're so close? It's called the human factor. It seems to leave you cold. Your friend Milan... What will he say about you betraying him? Everyone betrays at night. You should know. So what now? I'm going to the police. I'll tell them everything. You can warn Serki. He can leave the country and forget us. That's the new deal. Take it or leave it. You'd be implicating me as well. Thought about that? A dream come true. Leaving town? I was going to see a friend. Where's Milan? Tiny problem. Victor changed his mind. Fine. I respect him not wanting to come off as a rat. But he's going to die anyway. You realize these fucks-ups are your responsibility. I told you from day one. What was I supposed to do? I wasn't in Mexico. I didn't rat on you. Get out. I'm sick how everything with you is my fault. Get out! Why can't you forget these pricks? You and I should go into business. A restaurant near the Champs-Elysees. We'll invite every Paris bigwig to the opening. David Guetta on the left, Bob Sinclair on the right. Don't know 'em. No big deal. We can go visit the place tomorrow. What do you think? I think you talk too much. It was my father who helped you get started in Mexico. He invested in you. How does that concern you? Serki, I'm sorry to say it, but you owe my family. Listen. Hear that? Listen... Your daddy's coming for you. The girls? He said he wouldn't touch them. Don't touch me. Come here. Go away! Don't touch me! Get lost! Go away! Get out of our lives, please. I'll kill the bastard. I swear I will. I don't care. It's too late. Can't you see? Did Milan do this to you? What a bastard. I'm the bastard. Don't talk nonsense. - I'll clean you up. - No time. We have to go. Why do we have to? - I want to see the kids. - I forbid you. You forbid me? Let me see them. You had a deal with Wilfried. To give his whereabouts. It didn't work! I tried. I called them as soon as I could. He's my friend, dammit! I couldn't. Did he say anything? That he'd have killed me if we were still together. That the night wasn't over. I'm sorry. Leave, Milan. Leave, please. I love you. All three of you. You know it. Tell me you'll never forget. Please. For how long? No idea. You go. I'll join you. We go together! The police are coming. I told them. They'll protect us, then... we'll start over like before. Go upstairs. Police! Freeze! Drop the gun! Drop it! Put your hands up! Subtitles: Andrew Litvack Subtitling: L.V.T. - Paris
