Why don't you put on your Sunday's best, let's go out to eat, huh? Yeah? Yeah. Are you sure? Yeah. Well where do you wanna go? Olive park. Shit, I love Olive Park. - Let's go to Olive Park. - Yeah? Get some fucking bread sticks? Yup. What's up? Well don't you two look nice. Shit yeah, I mean it is the Olive Park. Yeah but you don't have to dress up to come here anymore. What? Shit. Hey, Pico! I knew you recognize me. What are you doing here? Oh, it's you. Yeah it's me. You guys got any mild sauce today and shit to put on those enchiladas? Mmm, I'm going on my break now. Look at you, sleepy. I think we request Pico. Ooh wee! Yeah, Crystal, what's up, girl? Hey, Dale! Yeah, mmm. Gotta love the Olive Park, you know. Yeah, all right. Ginger, I can't find the chili powder! It's in the cabinet, dear. Above the stove. It's not in the cabinet. All right, I'm going to the store. Okay. Take Handsome with you. Fine, dear. Come here, Handsome. Yes, you're so sweet, come on. So what's up with your parents? Well, they adopted a baby from Africa. I don't know, they try to act ethnic because they think it'll make them cool parents. You know, I don't know. I think that they just want for Keyshawn to get older and kind of be amongst his own people. You know, his own tribe, tribal community thing so you know, I don't know. They've always just been into that whole fricking sub-culture. We've actually been working on learning their language together. That means hello in where he's from. Oh my god, I'm scaring you off, aren't I? No, shit makes sense. I love fucked up broads like you. Hey, Waco. I take it you'll be playing credit card roulette again? I take it you're very good at sleeping? Charming. Pff. Fuck you. I had a really great time tonight. Me too. Mind if I finger bang you with my mouth? Yeah. Okay. Fucking right. Stop! Hammertime! ♪ Whoah ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh ♪ Oh, Frankie, honey. Are you okay? Ah, it's that old pop-locking injury again. Come on, come on. Mom, Dad, you're embarrassing me! Jesus! God! Oh well all right. You're here. Great, why? You don't work here anymore. Huh, why? Well as a member of the Chili Cook Off team, it's imperative that you remain impartial. After what you did last night with a contestant, it makes it impossible for you to carry out those duties. So supple. I tell you what. I think there's other arrangements that could be made. Oh my god. Nice ass. If we weren't married. Right, right. If we weren't married, of course. I'm paying you. Get back to work! Yes, sir. This is how I'll stare at them the whole night. I swear to god, for like seven hours, bro, I was like. What? Do you have snot coming out of your mouth too? Fuck. Hey babe, what's up? Fauxman saw us kiss. He got me fired. Ah, shit, you all right babe? Come here. I'm sorry, Dale. My mama warned me about this. She told me I was living in a gangster's paradise. She told me not to go chasing waterfalls. Why the hell is this my fault? I didn't do anything. You were too legit, Dale. Too legit to quit. What does that mean? You can't touch this. Come on, baby! Could be! We ain't doing the chili? No! Shit! What you gonna do now, Dale? Her heart has turned to ice, ice, baby. Well I ain't going after her. I'm out of shape. Shit, I don't know. I guess I'll get her her job back, huh? Figure that out. Get her her job back? How in the name of a whispering stream cutting through a mountain range under a deep blue sky near a happy little tree of a Bob Ross painting are you gonna do that? Richmond! Mr. Richmond! Oh, oh. I want what I have in your mouth. In your mouth. Here. Sign these. Richmond! Oh, I wanna hit that. Richmond! You gotta get Tori her job back. I have no idea who you're talking about. Nor do I care. She's a hot little piece of ass that works here, I don't know. Lipman got her fired and she didn't do shit. Sorry buddy, not my problem. Shit, you couldn't get her job back if you wanted to. You're a little bitch boy of Lipman. Hey. What? Of course I can get her job back. I'm Aaron fucking Richmond! Problem is, not only do I have no desire of helping that fine piece of ass Tori. I think I might tap that. You just said two seconds ago you didn't know who she was. Now you know her? Oh, but don't I? I always do, bitch. Shit, all right I got an idea. What's up? You're a little firecracker, you know? All right look it, there's a Chicken Wang eating challenge at the Moist grill. If I win, you get Tori her job back. Unless you're too scared. Aaron Richmond fears no food. Unless it's footlong hotdogs. They make me uncomfortable. What do I make out of it? Is that your truck? Yeah. Tell you what. You beat me, I get Tori her job back. But if I win, I get your truck and your girl. All right man, you got a deal. Okay, fellas. The Hillbilly Chicken Wang Challenge. The first one to eat and complete wins. Everyone understand? Three, two, one. Dominate your chicken wing! Is it fun being like a reality show star instead of like a real actor? White people. Hey, Aaron, look at these! Woo! Dale, your last bite! Winner! I put all of you in the poor house. And why not? I'm Fauxman! Tori's back in. What? Richman let Tori back in. Well, we've gotta put a stop to this. Archdale can't win. We can't. Richman's our biggest draw. If we lose him, the Chili Cook Off won't go. We've got to do something about this! And fast! The Chili Cook Off is tomorrow! I have an idea. I do like your ideas. Do you, really? Yes indeed. Yes indeed? Yes indeed, yes indeed, yes indeed, yes indeed. Why you fucker! Dick. Chili princess returns. I knew you couldn't resist. Fuck Fauxman, you guys. Yeah? Yeah, let's get 'em. How'd you find out? Rick called me. Rick? Dale, a girl like this is more than just an awesome high and perky rack and an ass that won't quit. I know, that ass won't quit. It's special. You feel it here. Yeah. - I feel it too. - Not just down here. Well a lot down there. But here. And I know that I'll find somebody. I'll find somebody. You will, Rick. But you found yours. This is yours! I know, she hot. Come here, Rick, I love you, come here, Rick. I was like, fuck you, stoplight, I pay taxes on my unemployment. Fuck that shit, dude. - All right. - Fuck. Oh, no. It's bad, I'm sorry. Fuck man, that shit taste like shit, Rick. That's bad, dude. Come on man. I'm sorry. Mind if I grab that ass? No. God damn. I've been working out. Dale. You are something else. All right, all right. Now try. Holy shit! That's it. That's great! - Yes! - That's it! Fuck yes! I love it Rick! I love it! Yes! This is the chili that will win the contest. Sorry, we have to take your chili for inspection. The shit? Yeah. According to like, bylaw two or something, any contestant operating with a former member of the chili contest, we gotta inspect the chili, yeah. Hey, forget about it. It'll be waiting for you back at the contest, yeah. The shit, man? This ain't good. All right, listen, Rick, stick with the chili, man. I don't trust these rich fucks. Tori, let's go get drunk. The rest of you shits I don't give a shit about. Let's go, baby. Hey, can you tell me if these are ripe? They feel ripe to me. Oh, look at those titties! My clock says it's time to fuck! Hey look at you sexy little thing. Aren't you sweet. Come on. Mr. Bambino grows tired of waiting. He wants his 50 grand today! Our family's recipe wins every year. You'll have the money by the end of the day, I swear. I better. Mr. Bambino grows impatient. Yeah! Welcome to the 10th annual Chili Cook Off.
