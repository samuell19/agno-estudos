Hold it! Do you have any idea who you're fighting? I'm on your side. Don't tell me... Hey. Look behind you. Look behind you! See... You killed them all. Don't you remember killing them? Do you remember your name? My name... Not yet? You mean breakfast? The agent was seen crossing the border with Koga. But where? The border is so long. There's been no more sightings. How about you? Where have you been until now? You can talk! Why did you get here so early? What are you inferring? I know you're scheming. You know they call me "Fox." Foxes like to scheme. Foxes are deceptive. A hot pot with fox meat sounds okay to me. Listen, Mitsu. What? I'm sure that the agent will come. How do you know? I just know. How come? Not eating breakfast makes me hungry. I know that much. So you don't know. Evasion is good in these times of civil war. It would be interesting if the agent didn't turn up. I don't know my name. How come? I guessed that's what had happened. Your name is Tao. Tao? And I'm Jaki. A demon god from hell. It can be read as "weirdo," but that's wrong. It's demon god. He ignored me! What is this? What happened? You fought those ninja troopers. You killed them. The blow to your head made you forget. All of them? I found you when I arrived. I tried to rouse you but you attacked me. So I backed off and watched from afar. I don't want to be killed by a friend. You're a friend? Yes. We've often fought together. We grew up together. Too bad I'm not a cute girl. Who am I? I told you, you're Tao. We work for the Iga ninja clan. Iga ninja? That's right, we're Iga ninjas. We're the shadows. Weed... That's right! We get called "moss," "bug" and "halfwit." We're the lowest ranking ninja, but we're good. It looks like you remember some ninja lingo. A natural born ninja! Only ninjas with proven skills get tattoos. Shadow... A blow to your head made you lose your memory. It'll return. An old ninja once told me... ...a hit to the head can cause memory loss. For how long? Don't ask me! I don't know. Maybe an hour or a year. But we can't wait around here. Why not? Look at those ninjas. They're Iga ninjas. You said I fought those ninjas. You did. If I'm an Iga ninja, why did I kill them? Strange, huh? But actually, it's simple. They were after something. What? Let me show you. Who is she? Another old friend of yours. Her name is Kei. Kei. Why isn't Kei here yet? I don't know. But she works for you. Yes, but she refused to be my woman. You'll be punished if she doesn't return. You, too. Those steel balls on your face will be ripped off. You know the ninja who messed up and got beheaded? You watched on and ate a rice ball. A man's beheading causes me no pain. And if I was beheaded I'd feel nothing. When that happens, I'll be there to watch. With some rice balls to munch on. I'll say it once more. Kei will return. Then we'll know who it was. She was a traitor. A traitor? You had arranged to meet her here. I was meeting a traitor? Where's your proof that she was a traitor? You remember her? No. You were close to her so I thought you might remember her. Why did she double-cross us? You got that wrong. She was spying on the Koga ninjas. The Koga? She betrayed the Koga ninjas. The Koga? I'll infiltrate the Kogas. First, I'll join a circus troupe in Kyoto. Then, I'll approach troopers in Koga. I heard the troopers are hungry for women. I'll get close to some of them. That's all an unskilled ninja like me can do. It's that or become an old master ninja's mistress, and die in shame. I'll make it out alive, so meet me here. I'll make it out alive. Did you remember something? I remember meeting her. So she met you before she left for Koga. She was trying to identify the Koga spies among us. Koga spies in Iga? She must have charmed the Koga ninjas because some of them told her the spies' names. She was going to report back with a list of names. She didn't? For some reason she didn't return. She could've just handed the list to her superior. Why didn't she? I don't know. I guess she came here instead. Yes, unless she walked over here dead. And I met up with her? I don't know. Did you? What do you remember? The ninjas were here... ...but I couldn't make out what she was saying. That means she was alive when you came here. Hurry up and remember! If 1 hit you with my fist you might remember. You're dazed but quick! What's up? The Koga ninja troopers. The Iga and Koga are keeping us busy. Hey, you wasted your time chasing that woman. Too bad, she's fucking dead! Now nobody knows what happened to the list. We don't have the list, idiots! Don't waste your time with us. Anyone who knows about the list shall be terminated. Right. I'll terminate you, fucker! Don't blank out on me now! Maybe the Koga ninjas are after Kei. Right. The Koga wouldn't tolerate a double-crosser. Maybe she's already dead. That's not what matters to me. The list is all that matters. Who knows if it even exists. Why wouldn't it? We'll know when someone returns. Who's the traitor? Someone will return like I said. Then we'll find out everything. You remember how to kill. My body remembers. Cool. How's that? Did we used to fight together like that? We're some of Iga's best ninja troopers. Come on. Did you remember something? Yes. What? Tao, you came. What's the panic? They're after me. The Koga? No. Iga ninjas. Our people? It makes no sense! I found out who the traitors are. Now they want me dead. Did they ambush you at the border? Yes, they intended to attack me. What about the list? I don't have it. You don't?! No. What happened? So what happened? The lga ninjas came before she could answer. The ones you killed? Yes. Then what? Here yet? See for yourself. It won't be long now. So you told Kei to meet you here? What are you scheming, Fox? How about you? You're just pretending to panic. You showed up late. Is that because you met Kei? She'll be here before sunset. --You going? --To look for her. Don't. --What's it to you? --Stay. Kei will come here. The Koga ninjas might be after her. Are you worried that I'll get the list? How about you, Fox? If the enemy gets hold of the list, the Master will punish me. It'd be the end of us. It'll suit you to rock uselessly right here like a Dharma doll. I'm not waiting for my limbs to be cut up by the Masters. They all think they can outfox me. What now? They killed her. You mean, Kei? Kei was killed. And? Your memory's back? No. Oh, please! If you remember, tell me. One thing... What? So Kei did not have the list? No. She didn't? She had nothing at all. That's what I remembered, too. Why didn't she have it? Maybe she knew that the traitor would ambush her. And steal the list? Otherwise she'd have had it on her. Maybe she hid it somewhere on her way here. What? Do you remember hiding it? No. Don't mislead me! What now? I only came here for Kei. Right. But she's dead now. Right. --There's no list. --Right. Will you look for it? Not unless you remember something. I don't. When will you? How would I know? Then we have no business here. What then? Let's go. Where to? An abandoned temple? A temple? About a mile away. What's there? Our people. Iga? No, the Koga. Just kidding. It'd be bad, huh? Going somewhere? --To bury... --What? The woman. There's no time! The Iga traitors or the Kogas might come. There's no list so let's go back to our clan. We can get you some treatment. With no memory of the list, you're useless. I won't help you the next time. Alright... We understand each other. I know things are hard for you. And that woman was impressive. But these aren't peaceful times. Nobody would give a damn if low ninjas like us were left to rot. Halt! You scared me. The woman? Wait... Where's she? She's dead. What? Kei's dead? Yeah, who else? And the list? I don't know. We were told to get it from her. What were you doing? Mind your own business. You! What do you know? I--- He doesn't remember. He was hit on the head by the Iga ninjas. The lga ninjas? So there are many things he can't remember. That's what took you so long. You didn't wait! Sorry I'm late. He really can't remember? He remembers some things but nothing about Kei. So she's really dead? Poor girl, she's really dead. She survived the enemy territory and died in her own land. Our Master won't like that. How do we find the list? Does anyone know where it is? Chill the fuck out! You should worry too, you smartass weed! The Master will yell at you and remove one arm, a leg and an eyeball. Don't worry about that. What do you mean? Show him. It's the list. Quit staring. I'm sure the enemy could not resist your charms. It's all yours. Wait! Where are you going? I know that my work as a spy isn't finished. I'll be sent back to Koga but there's something I must do. Are you telling us the truth? Why else would I have the list? You could have told me! I have a good reason. What's that? You sons of bitches... I read the list Kei handed me... ...and found your name on it. You wagged your tail and pretended to obey our master's instructions, but you're a Koga spy. What are you saying? You know that's not-- Now, Tao. As for you... Your name is on the list, too. Run, Tao! What? I had to do it. My duty was to reveal the traitors' names. I had to expose you... ...or I'd have been a traitor and my family would have been executed. You must have betrayed the clan for a reason. I know you did! You can still escape. I don't want you to die. You have to run! Now! You probably don't remember, but after Kei gave me the list she must have gone to see you. I guess Kei felt she had to write your name on the list. She was such a dutiful ninja. She ran off so she could tell you to leave Iga. And you realized that we knew you were a traitor. So you killed Kei. She risked her life to save you only to be killed by you. Poor woman. I guessed that she'd run off to warn you. Just in case the troopers failed to kill you, I sent Jaki. By the time I got there all the troopers were dead. So you intended to kill me? Because you're a traitor. You had many chances to kill me. Why didn't you? I thought that the amnesia might make you reveal something. About the list and those who hired you to betray us. But you didn't. Tao, I have a proposition for you. You betrayed the Iga clan and killed a woman ninja from your clan... ...though she tried to save you. It's complicated for you because of your amnesia. In that sense you're neither an lga nor Koga ninja. So? You should leave your ninja life behind. You're letting off a traitor? Yes, that's it. You can't be with the Iga clan. You can't go back to Koga if you remember nothing. They'd kill you if you returned. So go. I'm in the merciful mood. You risked your life for the sake of my clan, too. If Kei was alive, she wouldn't want you dead. To be honest, I don't think that the two of us could beat you. You're the top ninja. I don't want to die for the Master. I'll tell him that you ran off. The only thing that counts is the list. I'll take no risks. You, sly fox. In times where it's dog-eat-dog, honest ninjas end up dead. Amen to that. I see. Now go bury Kei's body like you wanted to. So you knew! I wasn't sure. What do you mean? Tao, you came! What's the panic? This is bad! You know I've been tracking down the traitors but I found an unexpected traitor! Who? The Fox! And I'm supposed to deliver the list to him. The Fox... He might try to kill me. Where's the list? Fox was to see it, so I didn't make it. What will I do? Does Fox control our ninjas? Will Koga destroy Iga clan? Will they kill us both? I went undercover for nothing. Tao... Tao! Kei! Kei! Tao... Kei... Kei. Kei! I see. So you made up that story about meeting her! Because I couldn't figure you out. I couldn't piece it together at first. You deceived me, you scum! I couldn't have killed Kei. You cornered and killed her in the cave where she couldn't escape. Because the list was never made, I had to wait until you confessed. Now I can report it to the Master. The Master sent you? He sent me to find and kill the traitors. He's smart. His master plan was to investigate us. Did Kei report to you? Quit staring. I'm sure the enemy could not resist your charms. I'm the first to admit that. I'm sorry I made you wait, but I failed. What? Where's the list? There's no list. I found no spies. I'm going back to continue my investigation. Please inform the Masters. I'll finish what I started. Wait! Back to Koga? I can't just go back to Iga. I'll be erased for my failure. I don't want to end up as some ninja's mistress either. You sent me to Koga, hoping to make me your mistress. You thought I'd fail. If you expected me to plead for my life, you're wrong. If you find Tao, ask him about the list. I know Kei will tell him about the list. Find out and kill them. That's how it was! Kei would've lived if she'd become my woman. You let me live so I'd talk. Now I can kill you. You killed Kei! You couldn't even protect a woman, you useless piece of shit. Some ninja hunter you are. Tao, you're in our way. We work for Koga clan. With Lord Oda's support, we'll rule by fear! I'll wipe out the Iga clan. Isn't that a shame? Kei died for nothing after all. Shut up! Don't waste your life. You're good, but not good enough for the two of us. | warned you! I've waited too long. I need some exercise. Suit yourself. Very good. You son of a bitch... W-Wait! God, you're a handful. You betrayed those who trusted you. You sold your spirit to the Koga. You deceived Kei and killed her. You'll pay for your crimes. I'll go and bury Kei now. I'll be back for your head. Because that's my duty. I'm a ninja hunter.
