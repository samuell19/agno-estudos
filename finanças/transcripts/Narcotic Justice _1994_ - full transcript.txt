Now if you don't mind I'd like to go clean up. - Joe watch your step. - I'm not worried about Martel. - I meant with the actress. - I'll carry my gun. (dramatic music) Detective Joe Average. Homicide. I called your agent he told me where to find you. - Now look if this is about Blake I have nothing to say. - When was the last time you spoke with him? - Months ago. - Why did he have a restraining order on you? - Because there was a time in our relationship I would've killed him myself. - Did you? Do you have any idea who he worked for? - Drove trucks outta Mexico that's all I know. He had vegetables on his brain. - Look it's hot do you mind stopping? - I don't wanna cool down. - You either cool down here or in a holding pen take your pick. - Look cop don't get tough with me. - Who was Blake driving for? - He mentioned a Walter Dunning once. - That's better. - Look Blake was a son of a bitch and a loser now if you don't mind I'd really-- - He was about to run off with another woman. - He was always running off with something and usually it was his mouth. - Look if you're hiding something your life could be in danger. - I don't scare easily cop. (dramatic music) - That's far enough right there Average and don't get tough. - What, ruin a good shirt? - What do you want? - Talk with Walter. - What about? - About how I had to push my way through some smart ass punks so I could talk with him. - You know one of these days we're gonna meet in a dark alley Average and we'll see who is the punk. - What's the matter Billy? Your ass still sore from the pen? - Fuck you. (thudding) (crying out) - Nice chatting with you Billy. (dramatic music) (laughing) (knocking) - Wait a minute. I got a dick at my doorstep. What? - Hang up the phone. - I'll call you back Fred. So talk. - Blake Johnson. - Listen if you've come here to pin anything on my boys again Average forget it, Johnson was a sweetheart of a driver and I'm sorry as hell the fucker's gone. - When did he work for you last? - Shit I don't know. Night before last he delivered a truckload of kale. - To? - I'd have to look it up. Look I got over 20 fuckin' trucks here. Maybe you'd prefer we bring in a few good men and go over your shipping reports. - Course what was I thinking of? Tuesday night, Martel produce. - Do you have any idea where Tonio Mandio is? - No but don't worry if I do a cop will be the first thing I call. - I ran across Billy Reese outside. When'd you start hanging out with convicts? - When you started arresting my employees. I trust you didn't hurt him? (dramatic music) Yeah it's me Joe Average just paid us a visit. It won't take him long to put two and two together and turn Tonio against us. You better you prick. Settle down this cocksucker I want my million fuckin' dollars Paris, I'm sitting up here with my ass hanging out while this mother fucker tryin' to kill me. Jesus not here what if Tonio decides to smoke us both out? Yeah, yeah I know where that is. I'll change I'll meet you there in 20 minutes. (dramatic music) - Hey Tonio, how's it hanging? - Right where you left it. - Hey chill homeboy it's time for a drive. - So you guys got guns? - Hey Tonio we don't need no guns we just wanna talk. - Okay. (thudding) (crying out) Come on, come on. (thudding) (crying out) You guys should have brought guns. Where's Martel and Dunning hiding out? - King warehouse, waiting for you. (screams) You son of a bitch. You son of a bitch. You son of a (crying out). - Give this to Martel and Dunning tell 'em I got the money and I'm on my way. - My finger. - You won't need it. - No! (gun firing) (dramatic music) - Patch me into 4023. Joe, Browning get this Blake made two calls to Theresa's number yesterday. - I talked to Walter Dunning. Blake delivered a load of kale to Martel's last night. - Things are getting interesting. What about Eddie and Billy? - I know where to find them. How about lunch? - Yeah I know where that's at, I'll see ya in 10. (dramatic music) And that's not all. What? What? - Hm? Nothing go on. - Blake's got two tickets to Maui waiting for him under the name of Mr. and Mrs. Smith. - How original. So first she called and left a message on her machine and then he called Theresa back and talked to someone for almost 10 minutes. - Could have been the maid. - Yeah it could have been Santa Claus but I doubt it. So Miss Fields did talk to her husband the night before he was murdered, about what? - I don't know? What do husbands and wives always talk about? - Money and restraining orders? - I'll buy that. - But why are they still married? - She's rich and famous. - She is now. - Meaning? - Meaning who and what was she before? - Are you saying maybe Blake has something on her? - Had. - What? - I don't know but if the world finds out I bet the advertisers won't be so willing to pay Miss Fields so much money to hock their wares. - Mrs. Fields, no. She's as refreshing as a blueberry muffin. - Trust me. - Television won't ever seem the same. - Look do me a favor get a court order and pull Johnson's banking records. See who's been paying him what on a monthly basis. - You mean alimony? - Something like that. If we're right I think Theresa may wanna cut us a deal or for whatever Blake had on her, books, photos. - Oh, do you mind if I finish my lunch? - By all means. - You gonna eat that pizza. - Nah take it. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (intercom beeping) - [Man] Who is it? - Joe Average homicide I'd like to take a look at Blake Johnson's apartment please? (mumbles) - Just buzz the door. (dramatic music) - [TV] Today on the channel four news, she was a typical teenager who turned into one of Holly-- (cheesy music) (moaning) - Actually no the lighting was a little dark. - I was only 18 I didn't know any better. - Just a horny little girl who had no idea you were ever gonna be famous. - Hey fuck you alright? We needed the money. Then an agent found me and I destroyed what I thought was the only copy. - Only Blake duped it in case you got smart and dumped him. - That's right give it to me. - Have you got a permit for that? - What, I walked into my murdered husband's apartment, I found an intruder how was I supposed to know you were a cop? - Better think it over. - I have thought it over for 10 years. Now give me the tape. - We know you've been paying Blake money every month. - So? - We also know he called you twice the night before he died. - Big deal, I forgot. - Look I'll destroy this tape right here if you tell me what you talked about. - Look I had nothing to do with this. He said he was ripping him off for a million dollars. - Well whose money was it? - Walter's. Blake was running coke across the border in Walter's trucks and he was delivering it to a Paris Martel and Blake would then deliver the money back to Walter, that's all he told me I... - What about Anna Martel? - I don't know maybe he loved her. He always had a thing for those young girls. - So he called you last night to let you off the hook. - Yeah. And Blake was always braggin', Mr. Bigshot. - Why didn't you just come right over here and get the tape? - Somebody's been following me. - Who? - Me, on your knees cop. - Don't try anything stupid. - It's to late for that. I'm already a dead man and I'm taking everybody with me. Stop looking for me or she goes first got it? - I got it. - Joe (crying out). - Hey what about the rent? - I've got your rent right here.

What the hell did you do that for? - B, come on get in here. - So if Tonio's got the money why doesn't he just run? - I don't think he wants to live. - Then why grab Theresa? - Buying time from us, getting even with Blake I don't know. - You think he's gonna kill her? - What's he got to lose? - What'd you find up at Blake's? - Nothin'. - Nothin', so you destroyed whatever it wasn't. - I don't know what you're talking about. - That good huh? - Good enough to explain the restraining order. - Just drive. - I don't like this. Where are those guys? - Shut up! God your whining's driving me nuts. - Listen if your daughter wasn't such a slut we wouldn't be in this mess to begin-- (thudding) (crying out) - Someone's up there. - Give him back his gun. - Hello ladies. - Shit Tonio.
