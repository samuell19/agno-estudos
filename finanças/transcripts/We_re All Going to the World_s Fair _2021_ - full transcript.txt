Hey, guys, it's Casey. Hey, guys, Casey here. Today I'm gonna be taking the world's fair challenge. Hey guys, Casey here. Welcome to my channel. Today, I'm going to be taking the world's fair challenge. This is Poe. He's going to be taking the challenge with us today. I don't know what to expect. Okay. All right, let's get started. I want to go to the world's fair. I want to go to the world's fair. I want to go to the world's fair. Okay. Okay. Okay, now, now the video. Okay, that was the world's fair challenge. Thanks for watching. And I'll make sure to update if I start to notice any changes. I think, I think I'm turning into something, something terrible. So you want to join the internet's scariest online horror game? Well okay. But just remember, we can't be held responsible for what you become. All you have to do to get started is take the challenge and then you begin reporting your symptoms. If other players like the direction you're taking the story, they'll help you expand it further. Small green brick dropping from my throat to my stomach, and then another. Orange this time. And shaped like an L. It took me a while to realize this is Tetris. I'm playing Tetris. Now it's all I'm doing. They're up to here now. They're getting closer to my neck. It's three o'clock in the fucking morning. Sorry. Hey guys. So, I took the world's fair challenge because I love horror movies and I thought it might be cool to try actually living in one. I used to sleep walk a lot as a little kid and I would tell myself these scary stories in my head so I could fall asleep for once. And when I'd tell myself these scary stories, usually when I'd fall asleep at night, I'd have these crazy dreams. And I swear in my head it was like Paranormal Activity. Like I'm not even lying with you. Like it was like I was walking around the house possessed by some evil spirit. It's funny, I'd be dreaming. I know I'd be dreaming when it used to happen but it was like I was also awake at the same time. It was like watching myself on a TV all the way across the room. And I was aware of my actions. Yes, granted I was aware, but I couldn't control myself. I've been kind of feeling that way recently ever since I watched that video. That feeling's kind of creeping up on me a little bit. I'm not really sure what to do about it. I was kind of used to not having to stress about every single time I fell asleep that I'd do something crazy or like get run over by a car, just like standing in front of the car. Cause I tell you if, if- I might be aware that a car is coming, but I would just stay there. My whole body's numb. I know it should be cold right now but I don't feel anything. Okie dokie artichokie. I'm going to record myself sleeping tonight. This is so stupid. Who wants to watch dumb videos? Hey. Shh. Shh. You're okay. Shh. Did you have a bad dream? Yeah. Those are hard. Sorry you had a bad dream. Shh, shh, shh. It's okay. You're fine now. It's okay. I know it takes a while to come out of the, out of the nightmare. Sometimes it feels, sometimes it still feels real even when you're awake. It's all okay now. It's all okay. You're okay now. I'm right here. I'm right here. You can go back to bed. Go to bed. Go back to bed. Shh. Close your eyes. Close your eyes. Close your eyes, close your eyes and go to bed. Close your eyes, close your eyes. Shh, shh, shh. Close your eyes, shh. Close your eyes. You can go back to bed. Shh, shh, shh. You can go back to bed now. Shh. You're okay. You're okay, you're okay now. Shh, shh, shh. Shh, shh, you're okay. You're okay, you're okay. Have sweet dreams. Have sweet dreams. Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet dreams. Have good, sweet dreams. Dream of good things. Dream of nice, warm wonderful things. You're safe. You're safe and comfortable with me. You're okay. Shh, shh, shh. Shh, shh, shh. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay. You're okay now. You're okay. Go back to bed. Hi guys. I'm JLB, and this channel is for my latest world's fair stories, drawing and fan theories. I love collaborating with other players. But be warned, this is an in-game channel for serious players only. So if you message me, I hope that you're ready to get scared together. Hello? Hi. Thank you for talking with me. I'm, I'm sorry my video scared you. I didn't know how else to get your attention. It's okay. But it's really freaky. Thanks. I've seen your videos. I've been trying to get in touch with you. You said you think I'm in trouble? How much have you read about the world's fair? Just a little bit. I mean, I mostly just watch the videos online. It goes a lot further back than that. Oh. Yeah, there's a lot of mythology, lore and history, different theories and supernatural events. It can be confusing if you're just starting to learn about it. But there does seem to be a pattern. You do the challenge, and then you start to change. Right. Right. The video. It's like a conduit. It can access your dreams, the deepest things you keep hidden, and then, then it changes you. I've seen it do things to people you wouldn't believe. What are you? A paranormal investigator? No. No. I'm nobody. Why are you talking to me? I want to try to help you if I can, but I need to know that you're telling the truth, things you described in your last video in the woods. I need you to promise me that you're not making it up. No, I'm not. How do you know? I don't. I mean, sorry, I'm I'm not that good at talking with other people. That's okay. It's okay. It's just for most people, I know it's a really big change, like they turn into a vampire, evil clown or something. It's not what it feels like for me. I understand. It's like I can feel myself leaving my body. It's like is making me someone else. It's making me bad. I can't tell my father about this, he'll think I'm fucking crazy. Will you keep making videos so that I know you're okay? Deal. Yeah, I'll try. Okay, okay. You know, I knew it would happened like this. All my, all my friends, they were so happy to just settle with like a little, little army men or Chinese finger traps. Not me. I needed to win it. It was Stitch. It was my favorite character from my favorite movie, big, fluffy plush doll, so big and cuddly, all the way on the top shelf. And I wanted it more than anything. I, I, I dreamt of it even. I would dream that, that I, that I'd just take it home and I would hug it and love it forever. It's gotten worse. But it feels good. It tingles when you touch it. what is that? What is that in there? Tim pick up. Don't watch the video. It's getting stronger. I want to go to the world's fair. I want to go to the world's fair. I want to go to the world's fair. This is another video for Casey from JLB. I'm going to try recording myself sleeping tonight. It's November 14th. 11:52 p.m. It's snowing here today. I need to figure out what's going on. It takes you about seven minutes to really fall asleep. Sleep is normal most of the night. You toss and turn a little bit. Now, watch this. This is right around 4:55 a.m. by my estimate. Casey, this is your scariest video yet. It's just like "Paranormal Activity". It's taking you over and making you someone else. Keep making videos so I know you're still okay.

Honestly. I spent most of it worrying about you, rewatching your old videos for clues. Casey, I can feel the forces of the fair pulling you in closer with each new video you upload. And I don't really know you, but I feel like I do. And I wanna save you. Send me a message when you see this video. We need to talk soon. Hey guys, Casey here. So I'm going to be doing a tarot card reading for whoever's watching. You know who you are. So we have the Knight of Wands, Knight of Pentacles, the Hierophant, Five of Pentacles, the Chariot, the Nine of Swords, the Nine of Cups, the Eight of Cups, the High Priestess, Three of Pentacles the Empress, Quee-King of Sword, excuse me. Four of Cups, Temperance. Whoever's watching this must be a little bit of a, a lonely person. Must be a little bit of a person who seeks comfort in things that they cannot have with the Nine of Swords. Probably has a lot of anxiety, probably has um, a lot of mental issues. The Three of Pentacles. They're trying to deceive people. I don't know if you guys can see or not. I could show you a little closer, but this guy he's just walking around like he knows everything. I hate people like that that know everything. They just always are like, well, no, this is how it is. Who are you to tell me how it is? Who are you to tell me how it is, I don't know. The Chariot. They keep pushing a certain agenda over and over again. They keep charging forward with the same boring message, acting like they're the big guy. But you have anxiety and you're lonely and you're fearful. So how strong are you exactly? How powerful are you exactly? Very slow moving. Nine of Pentacles. Can't seem to get a wrap on life, can you? I appreciate you guys for watching. And I'll talk to you guys another time. Bye. My father needs to go. I know this. I'll wait until the morning. It'll be a long time, but I won't be nervous. And then at 6am when he gets up for his first job of the day I'll be ready for him. Three shots to the stomach. And I'll stand there and watch him bleed. I don't wanna do it, but I don't think I'll be able to control myself. I don't know. Maybe I'll just kill myself instead. Why won't you help me? 19. 18. 17. 16. 15. 14. 13. 12. 11. 10. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. My name is Poe. I love you. I'm still scared of the dark. This little guy, he helps me sleep at night. I had him since I was five days old. No. No. Poe. What did I do to you? What did I do to you? I know how it's gonna end now. I'm going inside the video, through the computer, inside the screen. Are you familiar with the strange loop theory? The video's a fake, but so is all of this. What does that make the video? Strange loop theory is one theory, but have you read some of the others? I feel it though. I think I've always felt it. This world wasn't real. It's just some kind of dream I need to wake up from. Right. But have you read about Ka-Rom? She was trying to trap you inside the fair grounds. That's exactly what she'd want you to think. How long do you think I have? I mean you're the expert, right? How long until I do it? No need to sugarcoat it. I promise I'm not scared. I need to ask you something. Sure. What is it? Well, we need to go out of game first. Is that, is that okay? Sure. What's that? It's an expression. It means outside of the margins of the game, the MMORPG. I didn't know that term. Massive multiplayer online role playing game, you know it's just a game we're playing, right, right. Oh. I mean yeah. Yeah. And then, you know, they're just trail heads, right? The video, Ka-Rom, the strange loop theory? Trail heads? Stories, yeah, for us to explore because I've just been a little worried because I guess, I don't, I don't know how to say this exactly, but your videos have been pretty intense lately. Well, it's a horror game, right? Yeah, it's a horror game, but I, I don't know. When I was still in high school, and I had a tough time too, and I know it can be hard sometimes, and maybe you get stupid thoughts in your head. What, what do you think? I was actually gonna kill myself? I, I, I... Or kill somebody else? I was just worried. I wasn't sure if you were playing, or acting, or letting off steam or whatever. Or if you kind of meant it. I thought about reporting your videos, but I don't know. I know it doesn't really do anything. I could call police. I don't really know where you live. You thought about calling the fucking police! Jesus Christ! They're just videos. What is wrong with you? They're pretend. I have to go. Casey. That's not even my name. Wait. I'm sorry, you seem like you're, you know. I just need you to- No, no. I swear, someday soon I am just gonna disappear. And you won't have any idea what happened to me. It wasn't until a year later, I finally heard from her. She sent me a message on Skype, apologizing for not responding sooner. She told me that she had spent some time in an assisted care facility that winter and spring. And then she only now felt comfortable with writing. We traded messages for a while. She told me her real name. I told her mine. She told me she was starting a theater program in the city that spring. We met for coffee in Manhattan. And she finally saw my face. We made the awkward small talk. I think we both felt weird sitting there, actually in front of one another after all this time, like we both had so much to say, we just didn't know where to begin. Afterward, we walked uptown together, her towards the subway, me towards the Long Island railroad. And it was only outside the subway that I finally worked up the courage to ask her about that night. Before I could get the full question out, she cut me off. She apologized for the things she'd said to me that night. I told her it was all right. I knew she didn't mean them. And then she didn't say anything for a long time. But when she spoke again, it was like she knew she was about to say something that she shouldn't. That night I made it there. I know it sounds crazy, but it's true. I made it there, to the planetarium, across the crowds, into the heart of the fair. But something brought me back. I don't know what it was. So I told her how I had stayed up that night, all night till dawn with my hands on the computer screen and how I'd prayed for her. I know I felt it. We were hungry, so we grabbed dollar pizza slices from the dollar pizza place, made plans to meet up again soon and see a movie. And then we said goodnight. We hugged on the street outside Penn station. I couldn't believe I was actually there, that I was touching her. And then we both made our way home.
