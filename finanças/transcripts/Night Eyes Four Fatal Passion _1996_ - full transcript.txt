OH, GOD! CALL AN AMBULANCE! WE NEED HELP! SO YOU'RE NOT GONNA TELL ME YOUR NAME, RIGHT? I THINK I'M ENTITLED TO A PHONE CALL. YES, YOU ARE, RIGHT AFTER YOU TELL ME YOUR NAME. IN FACT, I'LL PLACE THE CALL FOR YOU...TO YOUR PARENTS. THAT'S WHAT I'M AFRAID OF. LISTEN, I REALLY DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS, MISS. EITHER YOU TELL ME YOUR NAME, OR I'M GONNA HAVE TO PLACE YOU IN A HOLDING CELL. FINE. PUT ME IN A HOLDING CELL. OFFICER, I HAVE TO GET TO THE HOSPITAL. JIMMY, ISN'T THIS THE GUY YOU WANTED TO TALK TO? YEAH. YOU WANT TO COME WITH ME? LOOKIT, HOW OLD ARE YOU, MISS? EXCUSE ME, MA'AM. YOU WANT TO TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED? GOT OUT OF THE SHOWER, HEARD A SOUND COMING FROM MY OFFICE, LOOKED IN, SAW A MAN WITH A MASK... CALLED YOU. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE AUDIBLE ALARM? WHAT WAS THE PROBLEM WITH YOUR SYSTEM, MR. CALDWELL? I--UM... OBVIOUSLY, SOMETHING WENT WRONG. THAT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT. WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT WENT WRONG. OK, LOOK, I PROMISE I WILL COME BACK TO YOUR HOUSE TOMORROW, AND I WILL GO OVER YOUR SYSTEM MORE THOROUGHLY. RIGHT NOW, I HAVE TO GET TO THE HOSPITAL. TOMORROW? WHAT ABOUT TONIGHT? WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? GO BUY A GUN AND TAKE CARE OF-- MY BOSS JUST TOOK A BULLET, MA'AM. RELAX. MR. CALDWELL... I PROMISE IF THE MALFUNCTION WAS THE FAULT OF NIGHT EYES, WE WILL TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY. RIGHT NOW, I HAVE TO GO. JENNY. HOW IS HE? WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING YET. YOU OK? THE GUY USED MY GUN TO SHOOT HIM. I CAN'T BELIEVE I COULD BE SO CARELESS. STOP IT. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR YOU TALKING LIKE THAT. FAMILY OF WILL GRIFFITH? ARE YOU RELATIVES? HE'S MY BOSS. I WAS WITH HIM WHEN HE GOT SHOT. MR. GRIFFITH MADE IT THROUGH SURGERY, BUT HE'S VERY WEAK. HE SUSTAINED A SERIOUS HEAD TRAUMA. WE'RE GONNA KEEP AN EXTRA CLOSE WATCH ON HIM FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS. CAN I SEE HIM, PLEASE, DOCTOR? NOT TONIGHT. HE'S IN INTENSIVE CARE. COME BACK TOMORROW. I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO. Woman, on P.A: DR. MOORE, REPORT TO E.R. STEVE, YOU GOTTA WAKE UP. STEVE. IS HE OK? EVERYTHING'S THE SAME. LOOK, YOU NEED TO GO BACK TO THE HOUSE AND CHECK THE ALARM FROM LAST NIGHT. I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE UNTIL WILL WAKES UP. THAT COULD BE A WHILE. I DON'T CARE. LOOK, STEVE, YOU'RE NOT DOING ANY GOOD HERE. I KNOW. BESIDES, WILL WOULD WANT US TO KEEP THINGS GOING. YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU CALL ME IF ANYTHING HAPPENS. CHARLES, GO ON. I TOOK SOME MONEY. DAMN--DON'T EVEN LIKE TO SAY "TOOK." I MOVED SOME MONEY AROUND WITH THE HONEST INTENTION OF RETURNING IT JUST AS SOON AS I GOT BACK ON MY FEET. [CHUCKLES] FIRST FEW TIMES, EVERYTHING WENT SO SMOOTH, AND THEN LAST WEEK, I, UH... I TOOK A BIG LOSS, AND THE NEXT DAY, THE COMMITTEE DECIDED TO MAKE A DONATION, AND I'VE BEEN ABLE TO STALL THEM THE LAST FEW DAYS, BUT THEY WANT THEIR MONEY, AND IT'S NOT THERE. YOU LOST IT. UH-HUH. HOW? GAMBLING. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ABOUT IT? I DON'T KNOW. [DING-DONG] HOW CAN I HELP YOU? HI. I'M STEVE CALDWELL. I'M HERE TO DO AN ALARM CHECK. IS DR. CROSS IN? UH, DR. CROSS IS WITH A PATIENT. SHE CAN'T BE DISTURBED. OH, OK. WELL, I'M GOING TO BE DOING A SPOT CHECK TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY MALFUNCTIONS IN THE SYSTEM, SO I JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE WARNING IN CASE YOU SAW ME OUT HERE IN THE BUSHES OR SOMETHING. WHAT WILL YOU BE DOING IN THE BUSHES? NOTHING. I'M--I'M JUST JOKING. DR. CROSS PAID A LOT OF MONEY TO KEEP THESE BUSHES LOOKING NICE. KEEP THEM THAT WAY. ROY! CAN I HELP YOU? Steve: OH, MY GOD. I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T SEE YOU GUYS THERE. WHO WAS THAT? I DON'T KNOW. WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME, CHARLES. WHAT AM I GONNA DO, ANGELA? SIMPLE. YOU NEED TO GET HELP. YEAH. WELL... WHY DO YOU THINK I'M HERE? NO, NO, NO. I'M TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE SPECIALIZED. 12-STEP PROGRAMS, GROUP THERAPY FOR GAM-- OH, THAT'S WONDERFUL! THAT'S BEAUTIFUL, ANGELA! THERAPY ISN'T GONNA GET ME OUT OF THIS BIND NOW, IS IT? YOU HAVE A BETTER IDEA? FORGET IT. I'LL WORK THIS OUT ON MY OWN. YOU NEED TO FACE YOUR PROBLEMS, CHARLES. OH, THAT'S GREAT. THAT'S GREAT. THANKS FOR NOTHIN'. [DOOR CLOSES] HELLO. HELLO. HEY, I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT INVADING YOUR PRIVACY. NO, NO, THAT'S OK. OH, I'M SARA. I LIVE HERE IN THE GUEST HOUSE. YOU LIVE HERE? MM-HMM. YOU'RE AWARE THAT THERE WAS A BREAK-IN HERE LAST NIGHT? YEAH. ANGELA TOLD ME. SHE SAID SOMEBODY WAS SHOT. DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT? YEAH. HE WAS MY BOSS. I WORK FOR NIGHT EYES SECURITY. I'M STEVE CALDWELL. OH. HI, STEVE. HEY, LOOK, I'D BE VERY CAREFUL IN YOUR GUEST HOUSE. WE HAVEN'T CAUGHT THE GUY FROM LAST NIGHT YET. I WILL BE. [TELEPHONE RINGS] DR. CROSS. [ELECTRONICALLY DISTORTED] I CAN SEE YOU. WHO IS THIS? SHUT UP! YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT. I ALMOST GOT IT LAST NIGHT. NEXT TIME, YOU WON'T BE SO LUCKY. THIS LINE IS TAPPED. IS THAT SO? DON'T INSULT ME. MAKE THIS EASY FOR YOURSELF. START COOPERATING...NOW. [CLICK, DIAL TONE] WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW? WELL, I'LL TELL YOU, WHOEVER DID THIS KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS DOING. HE BYPASSED ALL THE WIRES, AND A WHOLE NEW CIRCUIT BOARD IS NEEDED BACK HERE. WILL IT WORK? VERY GOOD QUESTION. I HOPE SO. TRUTH IS, ONCE AN INTRUDER KNOWS ABOUT A SYSTEM, HE CAN PRETTY MUCH FIGURE IT OUT AND GET HIS WAY AROUND IT. WE DO THE BEST WE CAN-- [KNOCK ON DOOR] SORRY TO BREAK UP THE PARTY. I NEED TO SPEAK TO MR. CALDWELL ALONE. [CHUCKLES] TALK TO YOU LATER, STEVE. SO SHE LIVES HERE WITH YOU? SARA'S THE DAUGHTER OF A FRIEND WHO PASSED AWAY ABOUT A YEAR AGO. SHE HAD NO PLACE TO GO, SO I TOOK HER IN. WELL, THAT WAS VERY NICE. I SUPPOSE. HOW'S THE GUY THAT GOT SHOT LAST NIGHT? THAT "GUY"? HIS NAME IS WILL GRIFFITH, AND HE HASN'T REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS YET. FIND ANYTHING INTERESTING? YEAH. AS A MATTER OF FACT, I DID. THE POWER ON THE CIRCUIT BOX WAS CUT. NOW LUCKILY FOR YOU, THE SYSTEM HAD A BATTERY BACKUP. HOWEVER, THE AUDIBLE ALARM DIDN'T HAVE ONE. SO WHAT'S NEXT? WELL, I'M GONNA REPLACE THE WIRES. I'M GONNA GET A NEW LOCK FOR THE BOX, AND WE'RE GONNA KEEP A VERY TIGHT EYE ON YOUR HOUSE FOR THE NEXT FEW WEEKS. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM. WHAT? NOTHING'S MISSING. SO WHOEVER WAS HERE THE OTHER NIGHT IS OBVIOUSLY GONNA COME BACK. THAT'S A VERY STRONG POSSIBILITY. SO? WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST? I COULD SUGGEST A NUMBER OF THINGS. UM, THERE ARE VARIOUS PERIMETER DETERRENTS THAT WE COULD EMPLOY: MOTION DETECTORS, SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS-- NO CAMERAS. THIS IS MY HOME AS WELL AS MY OFFICE, AND I WON'T HAVE MY CLIENTS FEEL AS IF THEY'RE BEING WATCHED. WELL, THAT'S NOT REALLY A PROBLEM, BECAUSE THEY MAKE CAMERAS THAT ARE PRACTICALLY UNDETECTABLE THESE DAYS. GOOD. WHAT ELSE? IT DEPENDS. IT... HOW FAR YOU WANT TO GO? I COULD--I COULD... ARRANGE TO HAVE AN ARMED GUARD STAND WATCH ALL NIGHT IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'D LIKE. THAT'S GOOD. I WANT THE BEST. WELL, I'M NOT SURE THAT HE'S AVAILABLE. WHY NOT? I'M THE BEST. [LAUGHS] WELL, I GUESS I WANT YOU. HOW MUCH? IT'S NOT REALLY AN ISSUE OF MONEY HERE. CAN I--CAN I BE PERFECTLY HONEST WITH YOU? I DON'T THINK YOU AND I WOULD GET ALONG AT ALL. LOOK, JUST BECAUSE I'M NOT SOME WEAK LITTLE FLAILING LADY THAT'S WAITING FOR THE CAVALRY TO COME IN AND SAVE HER DOESN'T MEAN A THING. LIKE I SAID, I DON'T THINK YOU AND I WOULD GET ALONG. IT'S IMMATERIAL. I WANT YOU. WHY? BECAUSE I THINK YOU HAVE A POINT TO PROVE. YOUR BOSS IS SITTING IN THE HOSPITAL WITH A BULLET IN HIS HEAD. OK, FINE. I'LL DO IT. GOOD. I'LL ARRANGE FOR THE INSTALLATION OF THE NEW SYSTEM, AND STARTING TONIGHT, I'M HERE DUSK TILL DAWN. GREAT. [BEEPING] [ALARM] [ALARM STOPS] CAN YOU IMAGINE THE PRESSURE ASSOCIATED WITH HAVING TO BE FUNNY EVERY SINGLE DAY OF YOUR LIFE? Angela: WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME ABOUT IT? PEOPLE SEE ME ON TV EVERY NIGHT HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH IDIOTS, AND THEY THINK IT'S EASY, RIGHT? Angela: IF YOU SAY SO. WELL, IT'S NOT. ONE NIGHT, IT'S EXOTIC ANIMALS FROM THE NATIONAL ZOO, AND THE MONKEY TAKES A CRAP ON MY DESK. THE NEXT NIGHT, SOME IDIOT FROM OHIO DRINKS MILK STRAIGHT FROM HIS DOG'S MOUTH, AND I'M SUPPOSED TO PRETEND TO BE INTERESTED. I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE BOTHERING YOU. BOY, YOU HAVE THIS AMAZING ABILITY TO SEE RIGHT THROUGH MY GARBAGE, YOU KNOW THAT, ANGELA? WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME ABOUT IT? I'VE BEEN, UH, FEELING A LITTLE GUILTY LATELY. ABOUT? IS THAT REALLY NECESSARY? DOES IT BOTHER YOU? YEAH, IT DOES. YOU'RE PROTECTED BY PATIENT-DOCTOR CONFIDENTIALITY. YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. OF COURSE NOT. LOOK, YOU'VE KNOWN ABOUT MY AFFAIRS IN THE PAST, AND HOW I'VE ALWAYS FELT THAT IT WAS A PHASE, A NATURAL THING THAT A MAN GOES THROUGH. YES. WELL, I'VE HAD ANOTHER ONE. I'VE BEEN MARRIED TO MY WIFE FOR 20 YEARS, AND I ADORE HER. WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT? I SIMPLY CANNOT RESIST BEAUTIFUL WOMEN, AND IN MY JOB, THERE'S A LOT OF TEMPTATION. EVERYTHING IN MY LIFE IS GOVERNED BY LOGIC AND GOOD SENSE, BUT, YET, I'M WILLING TO SACRIFICE THE ONE THING THAT I LOVE MOST. THERE IS SUCH A THING AS SEXUAL ADDICTION. PROMINENT, POWERFUL MEN ARE ESPECIALLY PRONE TO IT. I'VE BEEN CHEATING ON MY WIFE FOR OVER 20 YEARS. IF SHE EVER FOUND OUT HALF THE STUFF I'VE DONE, IT WOULD BE OVER BETWEEN US. ADMITTING THE PROBLEM IS HALF THE BATTLE. YOU REALLY THINK SO? YES. YOUR TIME'S ALMOST UP. THANKS, ANGELA. I'LL SEE YOU LATER. JEN. HOW IS HE? HAVE YOU SEEN HIM? NOT YET. I TALKED TO THE DOCTOR A COUPLE OF TIMES, BUT HE JUST LOOKS DISCOURAGED. DR. CHISSOM, HOW'S WILL DOING? OH, THERE'S NO REAL CHANGE. WE WERE HOPING HE'D BE OUT OF ICU BY NOW, BUT HE'S STILL UNCONSCIOUSNESS. SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? WELL, IT'S HARD TO SAY, EXACTLY. I MEAN, HIS BODY IS RESTING WELL, BUT THE FACT THAT HE'S STILL UNCONSCIOUS IS NOT ENCOURAGING. HOWEVER, UH, HIS VITAL SIGNS HAVE STABILIZED. CAN WE SEE HIM? OK. JUST FOR A MOMENT, ALL RIGHT? [BEEPING] HERE. I'LL BE OUTSIDE. HE DOESN'T LOOK GOOD. NEITHER DO THE TWO OF YOU. LOOK, I THINK YOU SHOULD BOTH GO HOME AND GET SOME REST. I PROMISE, IF THERE'S ANY CHANGE, I WILL CALL YOU. HE'S RIGHT. YOU LOOK TIRED. I AM TIRED. IT'S GONNA HAVE TO WAIT, THOUGH. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? DR. CROSS HIRED ME TO DO AN ALL-NIGHT SURVEILLANCE AT HER HOUSE TONIGHT. WAIT A MINUTE. I'LL GET SOMEBODY ELSE. WE'LL GET JAMES. NO, NO. THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? SHE WANTS ME. WHY YOU? BE-BECAUSE SHE WANTS THE BEST, THAT'S WHY. BESIDES, I WANT TO BE THERE. HAVING A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN, STEVE, IS NOT GONNA MAKE WILL GET BETTER. I KNOW, BUT I WANT TO BE THERE IN CASE THE GUY FROM THAT NIGHT MAKES A RETURN APPEARANCE. HEY. BE CAREFUL, 'CAUSE IF YOU DON'T, I'M GONNA KICK YOUR ASS. OH, YOU SCARE ME. [BEEPING] [DOORS UNLOCK] [ALARM] FREEZE! HOLD ON A SECOND. [ALARM STOPS] HOW THE HELL DID YOU GUYS GET IN HERE? WITH A KEY. STEVE, THIS IS MY FRIEND ROY. ROY, THIS IS STEVE. YEAH. NICE TO MEET YOU. UH, SORRY ABOUT THE-- THE BOTTLE. NO, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE BOTTLE. LISTEN, GUYS, THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. YOU CANNOT COME IN OR OUT OF HERE AFTER NIGHTFALL, EVEN WITH YOUR KEY, WITHOUT CALLING ME FIRST. OK. I JUST NEEDED TO GET SOMETHING REALLY QUICK BEFORE WE GO OUT. I DIDN'T KNOW, STEVE. NO, NO. IT'S MY FAULT. I SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU ABOUT THE NEW SYSTEM. SORRY ABOUT THE TROUBLE. IT'S OK. REALLY. UHH. I GUESS THE OLD LADY'S NOT COMING DOWN, EH? WHO? DR. CROSS? WHO ELSE? SHE LOOKS REAL NICE, BUT SHE'S NOT EXACTLY A BREATH OF FRESH AIR, NOW, IS SHE? WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON IN HERE? I HEARD THE ALARM. IT'S GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE I CAN'T TAKE A FRIGGING SHOWER ANYMORE WITHOUT SOMETHING HAPPENING. IT'S OK, DR. CROSS. IT WAS JUST SARA. EVERYTHING IS OK. JUST WATCH OUT FOR THE GLASS. Sara: WE'RE READY TO GO NOW. I'M GONNA GIVE YOU GUYS MY CELLULAR NUMBER. I WANT YOU TO CALL THIS TO GET IN OR OUT AFTER DARK. OK, WE WILL. Steve: DON'T FORGET. GOOD NIGHT, DR. CROSS. [SARCASTICALLY] GOOD NIGHT. I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT. [TELEPHONE RINGS] IT'S OK. HELLO? YES, MA'AM. DETECTIVE BRICE RESPONDING TO THE BURGLARY CALL. I'M DOWN AT THE FRONT GATE HERE. IT'S THE POLICE. THEY'RE AT THE FRONT GATE. OH! DAMN IT! I DIDN'T CALL IN AND ABORT. HE'S ON HIS WAY. [BEEPING] GUYS, I'M SORRY. IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAD A LITTLE FALSE ALARM HERE TONIGHT. YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU TRIP AN ALARM, YOU HAVE A GRACE PERIOD OF CALLING AN ABORT. IT SAVES US A LOT OF TIME. YEAH, I--I KNOW. I INSTALLED THE SYSTEM. WELL, THEN, YOU SHOULD KNOW BETTER. FALSE ALARM'S LIKE CRYING WOLF. AFTER A COUPLE MORE OF THESE, THE BOYS WILL BE STOPPING FOR COFFEE AND DOUGHNUTS ON THE WAY OVER. I'M SORRY. IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN. OK. HOW'S YOUR BOSS DOIN'? HE'S, UH, HE'S NOT DOING SO GOOD. HE'S STILL UNCONSCIOUS. I'LL HAVE MY MOTHER START A NOVENA FOR HIM TOMORROW. THANK YOU. LOOKS LIKE WE'RE CLEAR. AND WATCH THOSE ALARMS, OK? Angela: IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT? YEAH, EVERYTHING'S FINE. NEVER A DULL MOMENT AROUND HERE. WELL, I GUESS I'LL GO TO BED. GOOD NIGHT. I'M SORRY ABOUT TONIGHT. SORRY ABOUT WHAT? I DIDN'T TELL SARA ABOUT THE SYSTEM, I FORGOT TO CALL THE POLICE AND ABORT. I JUST FEEL LIKE A REAL IDIOT. IT'S NO BIG DEAL. GOOD NIGHT. [TELEPHONE RINGS] SECURITY. HI, IT'S SARA. UM...I NEED TO TALK TO YOU. OK, MEET ME AT THE BACK DOOR. HEY. HEY. ARE YOU OK? YEAH. EVERYTHING'S FINE. WHAT'S UP? NOTHING. I JUST WANTED TO ASK YOU A QUESTION BECAUSE I SAW YOU PUTTING UP SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS. YEAH? WELL, I WAS JUST WONDERING WHY YOU DIDN'T PUT UP ANY IN THE GUEST HOUSE. WELL, BECAUSE NOBODY'S BREAKING INTO THE GUEST HOUSE. OH. I WOULD HAVE GLADLY DONE IT, BUT DR. CROSS DIDN'T REQUEST IT. COME HERE, STEVE. WHAT? COME ON, I WON'T BITE. CAN YOU BRING ME AN APPLE? PLEASE? STEVE, YOU KNOW, I FIND YOU INCREDIBLY ATTRACTIVE. SARA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? NOTHING. "NOTHING?" WHAT'S THE MATTER? DON'T YOU FIND ME ATTRACTIVE? I FIND YOU VERY ATTRACTIVE. ALL RIGHT. WE CAN'T DO THIS. SARA, THIS IS NOT RIGHT. IT IS RIGHT, STEVE. COME ON. OH, GOD... STEVE, COME ON. IT'LL JUST BE OUR LITTLE SECRET. "OUR LITTLE SECRET"? NO ONE WILL FIND OUT. I PROMISE. SARA, STOP! THIS IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. WHAT'S WRONG? I'M GONNA LOSE MY JOB HERE. NOW GET DRESSED AND LEAVE, PLEASE. OK...BUT I THINK IT COULD'VE BEEN FUN. YEAH. BYE, STEVE. STEVE... GOOD MORNING. I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU. LAST NIGHT WAS THE FIRST GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP I'VE HAD IN A LONG TIME. WELL, THANK YOU. I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT. GOOD GUARD DOG. THERE YA GO. [WHISTLES] COME ON UP HERE. COME ON. [DOG YAWNS] [BANGING ON DOOR] YES? EXCUSE ME, WHERE'S ANGELA? OH, DR. CROSS IS UPSTAIRS TAKING A REST. SHE CAN'T BE DISTURBED. DO ME A FAVOR, GET OUT OF THE WAY. I NEED TO SEE ANGELA RIGHT NOW! PERHAPS YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ME. DR. CROSS IS NOT TO BE DISTURBED. IS THERE A PROBLEM HERE? WHO THE HELL ARE YOU? I ASKED YOU IF THERE'S A PROBLEM HERE. NO, THERE'S NO PROBLEM. EXCUSE ME! I THINK YOU HEARD THE LADY. WHAT'S GOING ON DOWN THERE? ANGELA, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU RIGHT NOW, AND THESE TWO ARE GIVING ME A HASSLE. IT'S OK, STEVE. IN MY OFFICE, CHARLES. I COULD HAVE HANDLED HIM MYSELF, MR. STEVE. OH, I KNOW THAT, RUTH. YOU HAVE A GOOD NIGHT. SEE YOU TOMORROW. COME ON, LET'S GO! HEY, HEY! GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME! YOU ARE OUT OF LINE! GET OUT! Charles: ANGELA! ANGELA! YOU'RE GONNA BE SORRY FOR THIS! I NEED YOUR HELP! YOU GOT 5 SECONDS TO GET IN YOUR CAR AND GET OFF THESE PREMISES. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? I'M FINE. DO YOU WANT TO TELL ME WHAT THAT WAS ALL ABOUT? I WORK WITH VERY TROUBLED PEOPLE. MR. HALE IS NO EXCEPTION. WELL, I THINK IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA THAT WE GO TO THE POLICE ABOUT THIS GUY. MY CLIENTELE ARE VERY PROMINENT PEOPLE. THE ONE THING THEY EXPECT FROM ME IS DISCRETION. IF IT GETS OUT THAT I'VE BEEN TO THE POLICE ABOUT A CLIENT, I THINK I LOSE THAT. YEAH, WELL, I DON'T LIKE IT. EXCUSE ME? LOOK, I'M SORRY. I UNDERSTAND YOUR SITUATION. DR. CROSS... I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT AS LONG AS I'M HERE, YOU'RE GOING TO BE SAFE. THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW. I REALLY NEED TO BE ALONE RIGHT NOW. ONE MORE THING. DON'T CALL ME DR. CROSS. CALL ME ANGELA. OK. [TELEPHONE RINGS] DR. CROSS. Man's distorted voice: TIME IS RUNNING OUT. JUST LEAVE ME ALONE. SORRY, I CAN'T DO THAT. I KNOW YOUR SECRET, ANGELA. IF YOU DON'T GIVE ME WHAT I WANT, IT WON'T BE A SECRET FOR MUCH LONGER. I CAN'T. ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, I'M GONNA HAVE MY WAY, ANGELA, AND ONE FINAL WORD OF ADVICE: KEEP THE POLICE AND THAT RENT-A-COP OUT OF IT. [DIAL TONE] SO, EVERYTHING GOING WELL AT DR. CROSS'? PRETTY GOOD, I SUPPOSE. WE HAD A LITTLE PROBLEM LAST NIGHT. I TOOK CARE OF IT, THOUGH. WHAT HAPPENED? ONE OF HER PATIENTS CAME OVER, ALL OUT OF HIS MIND. I THREW THE GUY OUT ON HIS ASS. CAME OVER ALL AGITATED AND CRAZY. SHE HAS GOT SOME REAL NUT CASES. TELL ME ABOUT IT. LOOK, I KNOW I SOUND LIKE A BROKEN RECORD, BUT PLEASE... [WHISPERS] ...be careful. YOU GOT IT. [ARGUING] Roy: YOU BITCH! Angela: YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT! I'VE PUT UP WITH THIS FOR ENTIRELY TOO LONG, AND I FEEL AS IF I'M BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF! I DISAGREE. HOWEVER, IF YOU WANT US TO LEAVE, WE'LL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO. I DON'T THINK YOU'LL BE PLEASED WITH THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT, THOUGH. ROY, PLEASE. EXCUSE ME. COME ON, LET'S GO. [KNOCKING] HEY. HEY, YOU'RE HERE EARLY. YEAH, UM, I'M SORRY THAT I WALKED IN ON SOMETHING I SHOULDN'T HAVE EARLIER. OH, THAT'S NOTHING. IT JUST REALLY INFURIATES ME THAT SARA PRACTICALLY MOVED ROY IN HERE WITHOUT EVEN ASKING ME ABOUT IT. ANYWAY, I'M JUST GOING TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT BARGING IN. YOU KNOW, RUTH HAS THE NIGHT OFF TONIGHT, AND I WAS JUST THINKING THAT I'D COOK DINNER. MAYBE YOU'D LIKE TO JOIN ME? OH, I DON'T KNOW. OH, COME ON. I'M REALLY A GOOD COOK. OK. OK. SURE. 7:00? GREAT. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR TALKING ME INTO DOING THIS. IT WAS REALLY NOTHING. I WOULD HAVE HAD TO EAT BY MYSELF, ANYWAY. DO YOU MIND IF I ASK YOU A QUESTION? NO, NOT AT ALL. HOW DO YOU MANAGE TO HAVE A SOCIAL LIFE? I MEAN, IF YOU WORK ALL NIGHT, THEN I IMAGINE YOU SLEEP ALL DAY. YEAH, WELL, HAVING A LIFE RIGHT NOW ISN'T ONE OF MY BIG PRIORITIES. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WELL, TAKE YOU, FOR EXAMPLE. I WOULD IMAGINE THAT YOUR SOCIAL LIFE WASN'T EXACTLY THE GREATEST WHEN YOU WERE PUTTING YOURSELF THROUGH SCHOOL, GETTING YOUR DEGREE. I WORKED VERY HARD. I WANT THAT KIND OF SATISFACTION SOMEDAY. I'M SURE YOU'LL HAVE IT... BUT DON'T OVER-IDEALIZE MY LIFE. I HAD TO MAKE A LOT OF COMPROMISES. YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'VE DONE PRETTY GOOD FOR YOURSELF. I ADMIRE THAT. THANK YOU. BUT YOUR LIFE IS INTERESTING. I MEAN, IT'S SO SIMPLE. THANK YOU...I THINK. YOU PROTECT PEOPLE, AND THAT MEANS THAT IT'S VERY UNCOMPLICATED. IT'S VERY CHARMING. BEFORE ALL THIS CRAZINESS HAPPENED, I USED TO BE VERY FUN AND SPONTANEOUS. I WAS A MUCH NICER PERSON BACK THEN. WELL, I JUST SPENT THE LAST HOUR WITH YOU. I'D SAY THAT YOU'RE A RATHER PLEASANT PERSON TO BE WITH. THANK YOU FOR DINNER. IT WAS GREAT. I SHOULD PROBABLY GO CHECK TODAY'S TAPES. OH, THANKS FOR KEEPING ME COMPANY. OK, LET'S GO OVER THIS AGAIN. I TOLD YOU, I DON'T... I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING. I'M OUTSIDE... DOING A ROUTINE CHECK OF THE PERIMETER, AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW, YOU'RE HERE. AND HOW ABOUT YOU? UM, I HEARD A SOUND OUTSIDE, AND I LOOKED OUT THERE AND SAW STEVE LAYING ON THE GROUND, SO I CALLED YOU. IS ANYTHING MISSING? NOTHING THAT I NOTICED. YOU NEED TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL? NO, I'M FINE. I'M JUST GONNA HAVE A LITTLE HEADACHE FOR A WHILE. WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? IS THIS THE YOUNG LADY YOU TOLD ME ABOUT IN YOUR GUEST HOUSE? YEAH, I'M SARA. AND HOW ABOUT YOU? I'M ROY SANDERS. NOW, DID EITHER ONE OF YOU NOTICE ANYTHING STRANGE TONIGHT? WE WERE SLEEPING. I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING. DID YOU HEAR ANYTHING? NO. WELL, I GUESS THERE'S NOT MUCH MORE WE CAN DO AROUND HERE. LET'S GO, VERNON. MAYBE WE SHOULD BE TAKING OFF, TOO. THERE'S SOMETHING I HAVE TO TELL YOU. WHAT? I LIED TO THE POLICE. THERE WAS A BREAK-IN. SOME OF MY TAPES WERE STOLEN. TAPES OF WHAT? MY PATIENTS' SESSIONS. WHY WOULD YOU LIE TO THE POLICE? YOU JUST HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M GOING THROUGH. WAIT A MINUTE. YES. WHAT? THE TAPES. WHOEVER IT WAS THAT BROKE IN IS ON TAPE. HE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS. GREAT. OH, MY GOD. THAT LOOKS LIKE YOU WEARING A MASK. WHAT THE HELL? TH-THAT IS NOT ME. OF COURSE IT'S NOT YOU. I KNOW THAT. ANGELA, SOMETHING IS VERY WRONG HERE. YOU ARE GONNA TELL ME EXACTLY WHAT IT IS THAT YOU KNOW. NOW, YOU LIED TO THE POLICE, THIS GUY IS TRYING TO MAKE HIMSELF LOOK LIKE ME. I NEED TO KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON HERE. I TOLD YOU, MY CLIENTELE ARE VERY PROMINENT PEOPLE THAT EXPECT PRIVACY. I HAVE TAPES WITH THEM THAT ARE SO COMPROMISING THAT IF IT GETS OUT, I LOSE MY REPUTATION. WELL, I'M SORRY. THIS HAS GONE WAY TOO FAR HERE. I THINK WE HAVE TO GO TO THE POLICE. I CAN'T GO TO THE POLICE. IF I GO TO THE POLICE, I LOSE EVERYTHING I'VE WORKED FOR. [CRYING QUIETLY] LISTEN TO ME. ANGELA... WE'RE GONNA GET THROUGH THIS. WE'RE GONNA WORK THIS THING OUT TOGETHER. I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE I CAN TRUST. YOU SIT HERE... AND I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [PLAYING BEETHOVEN'S FUR ELISE] ANYTHING FOR ME? YEAH, LOTS OF IT. BEEN A BUSY MAN. I JUST GOT BACK FROM THE HOSPITAL. DO YOU EVER SLEEP? NO. I'M SUPERMAN. THE DOCTOR SAID WILL'S CONDITION IS IMPROVING. I KNOW. LOOK, COULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR? SURE. DO YOU THINK YOU COULD GET A LIST OF ANGELA'S CLIENTS? WHAT DO YOU NEED THAT FOR? I WANT TO RUN BACKGROUND CHECKS BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE CRAZY HAPPENS. IT'S A LITTLE LATE FOR THAT. WE HAD ANOTHER BREAK-IN LAST NIGHT. WHAT? LET'S GO IN YOUR OFFICE. I'M OUTSIDE CHECKING THE SYSTEM. SOMEBODY HITS ME OVER THE HEAD. WHOEVER IT WAS GOES IN, STEALS TAPES OUT OF HER HOUSE. I'M OUT COLD THE WHOLE TIME-- ARE YOU OK? WHAT KIND OF TAPES? TAPES OF HER PATIENTS' SESSIONS. WHAT DID THE POLICE SAY? THEY DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING. ANGELA DIDN'T TELL THEM. SHE TOLD ME AFTERWARDS. WHY? SHE WAS AFRAID THAT IF IT EVER GOT OUT, THAT HER RECORDS WERE STOLEN, IT COULD CLOSE DOWN HER PRACTICE. YEAH, I GUESS THAT COULD BE... STEVE, THIS WHOLE SITUATION IS A LOT BIGGER THAN WE EVER ESTIMATED. OH, I KNOW. WE CAUGHT THE GUY ON SURVEILLANCE. DON'T TELL ME. HE WAS WEARING A MASK. YEAH. HE WAS DRESSED LIKE ME. OH, JESUS, STEVE, THIS WHOLE THING IS CRAZY. TELL ME ABOUT IT. LOOK, I'M GONNA GET YOU THAT CLIENT LIST. ALSO, THE GUY FROM THE OTHER NIGHT THAT I HAD TO KICK OUT... YEAH. HIS NAME IS CHARLES HALE. I WANT YOU TO RUN A CHECK ON HIM. YOU GOT IT. STEVE, THERE'S SOMEBODY HERE TO SEE YOU. HEY... WHAT'S GOING ON? THIS GUY'S BEEN FOLLOWING ME ALL DAY LONG. HOW DO YOU KNOW? I'VE BEEN EVERYWHERE TODAY, AND ALL I KEEP SEEING IS THIS CAR. DID YOU RECOGNIZE THE CAR? NO. BUT I DID GET THE LICENSE PLATE. JEN. YEAH? RUN A CHECK FOR ME. Steve: HEY. YOU GONNA BE OK? YEAH. I JUST FEEL MUCH SAFER WHEN YOU'RE WITH ME. COME ON. I'LL WALK YOU DOWN TO YOUR CAR. SO I'LL SEE YOU IN A FEW HOURS. I CAN'T WAIT THAT LONG. WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? DID YOU FALL IN? WHAT'D YOU FIND OUT? I CHECKED THE PLATES. IT'S A RENTAL. UNDER WHOSE NAME? MR. CHARLES HALE. [DOORBELL RINGS] CAN I HELP YOU? YEAH. I DON'T THINK WE'VE EVER ACTUALLY BEEN INTRODUCED. I'M STEVE CALDWELL. I WORK FOR NIGHT EYES SECURITY, AND I'M HERE TO GIVE YOU A WARNING. WELL, GO ON. LEAVE ANGELA CROSS ALONE. SHE IS NOT YOUR DOCTOR ANYMORE. NO MORE SESSIONS, NO MORE COMING OVER, NO MORE FOLLOWING HER ON HER ERRANDS. YOU'RE A SICK MAN. YOU NEED A LOT OF HELP. YOU GET IT FROM SOMEONE ELSE. I'M SURE I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. OH, I'M SURE THAT YOU DO. YOU JUST STAY AWAY FROM HER. YOU KNOW SOMETHING? IT'S TIME FOR YOU... TO GET THE HELL OFF OF MY PROPERTY, OR I'M GONNA GO INSIDE-- I WAS JUST LEAVING. [KNOCKING] ANGELA, IT'S ALEX! OPEN THE DOOR! WHAT'S WRONG? YOU OUGHTA KNOW! KNOW WHAT? I'M BEING BLACKMAILED. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, BLACKMAILED? SOMEONE JUST CALLED ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR AGO PLAYING TAPES OF OUR SESSIONS. [QUIETLY] OHH! I SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU. SOMEONE BROKE INTO MY HOUSE LAST NIGHT, AND THEY TOOK ALL MY RECORDS. ANGELA, IF MY WIFE FINDS OUT ABOUT THOSE TAPES, SHE'LL LEAVE ME. I DON'T THINK I CAN HANDLE THAT. I'M SORRY, ALEX. YOU OUGHTA BE! I TRUSTED YOU. LOOK, JUST GIVE ME SOME TIME. I CAN MAKE THIS ALL RIGHT. IT'LL ALL WORK OUT. I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT. YEAH, WELL, YOU BETTER TAKE CARE OF IT. IF MY WIFE LEAVES ME, I WILL BE HUMILIATED AND MISERABLE. AND I WILL MAKE SURE THAT YOU SHARE IN THAT MISERY. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? I'M GONNA MAKE SURE THAT EVERY ONE OF YOUR CLIENTS KNOWS THAT THEY COULD BE NEXT. [DOORBELL RINGS] HEY. DID HE HURT YOU? HE WAS SO ANGRY. I JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN. I'LL KILL THAT SON OF A BITCH. I WARNED HIM. IT'S OK. YOU LISTEN TO ME. WE HAVE TO GO THE POLICE NOW. WE HAVE PROOF. HE ASSAULTED YOU. OK. OK. TOMORROW MORNING, THEN. LOOK AT ME. YOU PROMISE ME. PROMISE. OH, HONEY, YOU'RE CRYING. Brice: YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY CAN'T EVEN SEE HIM ALL THAT WELL. YOU CAN SEE HIM WELL ENOUGH. WE CAN GO PICK HIM UP, BUT WE CAN'T HOLD HIM UNLESS YOU'RE WILLING TO FILE AN OFFICIAL COMPLAINT. WHAT AM I DOING HERE RIGHT NOW? WELL, I MEAN YOU'LL HAVE TO COME BACK TO HIS PRELIMINARY HEARING, TESTIFY AGAIN IF IT GOES TO TRIAL. WHAT'S THE MATTER? I... I--I JUST CAN'T GO THROUGH ALL THIS. WELL, IF YOU DON'T PRESS CHARGES, THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO. NO. THIS IS A DANGEROUS MAN. HE'S PROBABLY THE ONE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE OTHER STUFF THAT'S BEEN GOING ON AT THAT HOUSE. WELL, THAT MIGHT BE TRUE. BUT UNLESS SHE PRESSES CHARGES, THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO. I'M SO SORRY. NO, ANGELA, LISTEN TO ME. LISTEN TO ME. NOTHING IS GONNA GET BETTER IF YOU JUST LET HIM GET AWAY WITH THIS. I JUST CAN'T. HUH?! DO YOU WANT ME TO STAY HERE WITH YOU? NO. I HAVE TO WORK. ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE OK? YOU THINK THIS WHOLE THING'S GONNA ESCALATE? HEY... I WANT YOU TO TRY AND RELAX. I'M NOT GONNA LET ANYTHING GET WORSE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO WITHOUT YOU, STEVE. [POUNDING ON DOOR] [POUNDING] WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING? WHAT? YOU KNOW! IT'S UNPROFESSIONAL, STEVE, AND I DON'T LIKE IT. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I SAW YOU AND ANGELA KISSING JUST NOW. YOU KNOW... HEH. THINGS DON'T ALWAYS TURN OUT EXACTLY THE WAY YOU PLAN THEM, JENNY. AND WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? STEVE, WHAT WOULD WILL SAY? I'M SORRY. IT JUST KINDA HAPPENED. SHE'S A CLIENT. I KNOW SHE'S A CLIENT. BUT I CARE ABOUT HER. OH, I'M SURE YOU DO. OH, DON'T MAKE IT SOUND THAT WAY! SHE'S A WONDERFUL PERSON. AND I'M PROBABLY-- WHAT? NOTHING. OH, YOU THINK YOU MIGHT LOVE HER? DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, STEVE. THIS THING IS SLEAZY, PLAIN AND SIMPLE. YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW I'M FEELING. YOU KNOW, I THINK YOU SHOULD GO. FINE. DO ME ONE FAVOR. I KNOW, I KNOW. BE CAREFUL. HYAAAAH! OH! DON'T SCARE ME THAT WAY! YOUR MONEY OR YOUR LIFE. I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY, SO IT'S GONNA HAVE TO BE MY LIFE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I'M PUTTING THEM ON THE FLOOR. SIT DOWN. OK, I GIVE, I GIVE. GIVE ME A KISS. [BEEP BEEP BEEP] [RELEASE WARBLES] STEVE... STEVE. WHAT? I HEARD SOMETHING. IS IT SARA? NO. SHE DOESN'T KNOW THE CODE. CALL THE POLICE. [DIALING] FREEZE! MY GOD. OH, MY GOD. IT'S ROY. WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON? Steve: I SWEAR TO GOD, I DIDN'T HAVE ANY CHOICE HERE. I TOLD THE GUY TO FREEZE... AND HE RAISES HIS GUN TO SHOOT... HOW ABOUT YOU? WHAT DID YOU SEE? I DIDN'T SEE OR HEAR ANYTHING, EXCEPT THAT GUNSHOT. HAYNES! HAYNES! YOU WANNA BRING THE GIRL IN? WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A SEAT RIGHT HERE. OK, MISS... WHAT DID YOU SEE? NOTHING. NOTHING? WHAT DO YOU MEAN, NOTHING? WHAT WAS ROY DOING IN THE HOUSE WITH A GUN? I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WENT WRONG, I SWEAR. I DON'T KNOW. DOES HE HAVE ANY FAMILY? [SOBBING] MISS, I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET. BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO STAY WITH ME HERE A COUPLE OF MINUTES, OK? DID ROY HAVE ANY FAMILY? NONE THAT I KNOW OF. [SNIFFLING] LET ME TRY THIS, LIEU. OK. NOW... I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. LOOK, I TOLD YOU, WE ARE AS CONFUSED ABOUT THIS WHOLE THING AS YOU ARE. OHH... I'M BRINGING BOTH OF YOU DOWN TO THE STATION FOR QUESTIONING. THAT'S STANDARD PROCEDURE. THAT'S FINE. AND I'LL ALSO NEED YOUR PERMISSION TO TAKE A LOOK AROUND HERE AND THE GUEST HOUSE. ANYTHING THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN WHAT THIS KID WAS DOING HERE WITH A GUN. YOU HAVE MY PERMISSION. GREAT. HAYNES! HAYNES. YEAH? DO ME A FAVOR. YOU WANNA TAKE THESE TWO DOWN TO THE STATION HOUSE? I'LL SEE THEM DOWN THERE. NO PROBLEM. DO YOU MIND IF I PUT SOME CLOTHES ON? I--I HAVE TO GRAB A COUPLE THINGS AND PUT THEM IN MY TRUCK. RIGHT. JUST...HURRY UP. JIMMY'S NOT KNOWN FOR HIS PATIENCE. Brice: TAKE A SEAT, PLEASE. Haynes: HERE THEY ARE. COULD I HAVE A WORD WITH YOU IN PRIVATE, PLEASE? CAN IT WAIT? NO. EXCUSE ME A MINUTE. [WHISPERING] I'LL BE IN BALLISTICS. OK. UNH! YOU KNOW... THIS IS USUALLY A REAL QUIET NEIGHBORHOOD. YEAH? WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? SUSPICIOUS BEHAVIOR. YOU KNOW WHAT THE FIRST THING I LOOK FOR WHEN THERE'S A CRIME COMMITTED AND THINGS DON'T ADD UP? LET ME GUESS. SUSPICIOUS BEHAVIOR. THAT'S RIGHT. OFFICER HAYNES, THE GUY THAT BROUGHT YOU IN HERE, HE SAID HE SAW YOU IN THE SURVEILLANCE ROOM VERY QUICKLY, ALMOST FRANTICALLY, PACKING AWAY TAPES INTO THIS SMALL DUFFEL BAG. SO? HUH? WELL, WHAT'S THE RUSH? WHAT ARE YOU HIDING? NOTHING. WELL, HOW ABOUT LETTING US TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE TAPES? THERE'S NOTHING TO LOOK AT. I WAS DOING EXACTLY WHAT OFFICER HAYNES SAID. HE SAID YOU WERE A VERY IMPATIENT MAN. HE SAID I BETTER GET OVER HERE VERY QUICK. WE'RE HERE. I TAKE THE TAPES OUT EVERY NIGHT. I REVIEW THEM. I REPLACE THEM WITH BLANKS. THAT'S WHAT I WAS DOING. GOOD. THEN I DON'T MIND IF I TAKE A LOOK AT THEM? NO. I DON'T THINK THAT'S NECESSARY. THAT'S AN UNWILLINGNESS TO COOPERATE, AND THAT'S... SUSPICIOUS BEHAVIOR. YEAH? WELL, LUCKILY FOR US, WHAT YOU CALL SUSPICIOUS BEHAVIOR ISN'T A CRIME. MURDER IS A CRIME. YOU ARE OUT OF LINE, MAN! I AM PAID TO PROTECT PEOPLE! THIS KID WAS IN HER HOUSE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WITH A GUN! SO YOU SAY. BUT NO ONE SAW IT EXCEPT YOU. AND IT WAS THE SAME GUN THAT SHOT WILL--YOUR GUN. WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT? NOTHING. I'LL BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT THAT I DO NOT KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. Steve: NO, YOU DON'T. I'LL FIGURE IT OUT, THOUGH. YOU CAN BET ON THAT. CAN I GO NOW? ARE YOU FINISHED? SURE. YOU'LL BE HEARING FROM ME. YEAH, I'M SURE. JEN. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? POLICE CALLED ME. WE NEED TO TALK. RIGHT NOW. YEAH, I KNOW. YOU HEARD ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TONIGHT? YEAH. COME ON, LET'S GO. WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS GUY ROY? FRIEND OF SARA'S. THAT'S IT. DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. WHY WOULD HE BE PROWLING AROUND ANGELA'S HOUSE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, WITH A GUN, NO LESS? I'VE BEEN OVER THIS A MILLION TIMES, AND THERE'S NO ANSWER HERE, JENNY. WHAT ABOUT SARA? SARA WAS IN SHOCK. SHE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING. DAMN! THERE'S GOTTA BE AN ANSWER OUT THERE. WAIT A MINUTE. CHARLES HALE. NO. NO, I DID A BACKGROUND CHECK ON HIM. HE'S A SCUMBAG, BUT NOTHING MURDEROUS. HE HAS TIES IN VEGAS. HE WAS ARRESTED THERE FOR SOLICITATION OF A PROSTITUTE ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO. CHARGES WERE DROPPED. WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF HER PATIENTS? NOTHING. YOU KNOW, I ASKED YOU TO GET ME A CLIENT LIST. I GUESS YOU WERE A LITTLE DISTRACTED. ANYWAY, I MANAGED TO DIG UP A FEW NAMES, BUT... CAME UP CLEAN. WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GONNA BE LEANING ON SARA. NO KIDDING. SHE'S GOTTA KNOW MORE ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH ROY. YEAH. I'M GONNA GIVE HER A CALL RIGHT NOW. [RING] [SHAKILY] HELLO? Jenny: HI. IS THIS SARA? YEAH. HI, SARA. THIS IS JENNY JACKSON. I WORK WITH STEVE CALDWELL. I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD COME IN AND MEET WITH ME SOMETIME TODAY. NO. NOT TODAY. OK. WHEN? UH...I DON'T KNOW. I'M... I'M LEAVING TOWN TODAY. YOU'RE LEAVING TOWN TODAY? YEAH. I-I'M LEAVING TONIGHT. LOOK, I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT IF YOU COULD MEET WITH ME BEFORE YOU LEFT. LET ME GIVE YOU MY NUMBER. OK, FINE, BUT I PROBABLY WON'T HAVE THE TIME. IT'S 555-7492. AND THE ADDRESS HERE IS 7201 VENTURA PLACE. OK? [CLICK] SOMETHING'S GOING ON. I CAN FEEL IT. WHAT? I DON'T KNOW, BUT... SARA JUST SOUNDED REAL STRANGE. I'M GONNA GO TALK TO ANGELA. OK. I'LL CALL YOU IN ABOUT AN HOUR. FIND OUT WHAT YOU CAN IN THE MEANTIME. WHO WAS THAT? UH, JUST SOMEONE FROM STEVE CALDWELL'S OFFICE. ALL PACKED? YEAH. BYE-BYE. Man, on intercom: JEN, DETECTIVE BRICE IS ON LINE 2. HELLO? YES, I NEED TO SPEAK TO MR. CALDWELL, PLEASE. WELL, WHAT ABOUT? I JUST RECEIVED A PACKAGE FROM AN ANONYMOUS SOURCE. THERE'S SOME MATERIAL IN HERE I THINK HE'D BE VERY INTERESTED IN SEEING. WELL, WHAT KIND OF MATERIAL? JUST TELL HIM TO GET HIS ASS DOWN HERE. THANK YOU. [RINGS DOORBELL] HEY. CAN I COME IN? I DON'T THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. WHAT'S THE MATTER? THINGS HAVE GOTTEN A LITTLE BIT CRAZY, AND... I JUST THINK WE OUGHT TO SPEND SOME TIME APART. WHERE IS THIS ALL COMING FROM? A MAN WAS KILLED AT MY HOUSE LAST NIGHT, AND I DON'T KNOW WHY. EXCUSE ME IF THAT SHAKES ME UP A LITTLE BIT. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY? HE HAD A GUN. HE WAS GOING TO HURT YOU. I KNOW THAT. DON'T MAKE THIS ANY MORE DIFFICULT THAN IT IS. I ALREADY EXPLAINED TO YOU THAT I WORKED HARD TO GET WHERE I AM, AND I'M NOT ABOUT TO LET ANYTHING CRUMBLE AROUND ME. WAIT, WAIT A MINUTE. ANGELA. [LAUGHS NERVOUSLY] I CARE ABOUT YOU. PLEASE... JUST STOP. DON'T MAKE THIS HARDER THAN IT IS. I...I DON'T UNDERSTAND. ALL RIGHT. I DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO BRING THIS UP. I FOUND THESE WHEN I WAS CLEANING OUT ROY'S THINGS. TAKE A LOOK. WHEW... I SWEAR TO GOD NOTHING HAPPENED HERE. DON'T INSULT ME, OK? NOTHING. LET'S JUST CUT OUR LOSSES. I'M REALLY SORRY. REALLY. ME, TOO. EXCUSE ME. HI. I'M JENNY JACKSON. I BELIEVE THAT YOU SAW ME HERE LAST NIGHT. I WORK WITH STEVE CALDWELL AT NIGHT EYES SECURITY. YOU SAID THAT YOU HAD SOME MATERIAL THAT HE MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN SEEING. I DO. WHERE IS HE? WELL, I CAN'T FIND HIM. EXACTLY WHAT DO YOU HAVE? OVER HERE. OHH... OH, THIS IS RIDICULOUS. WELL, THIS DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. THAT'S TRUE. IT SURE LOOKS SCUMMY, THOUGH. THAT WASN'T STEVE. IT SURE LOOKS LIKE HIM. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE GUY WITH THE MASK. THAT WASN'T STEVE. WELL, THAT ONE LOOKED LIKE HIM, TOO. LISTEN, I TOLD STEVE YESTERDAY, I'M NOT SURE WHAT'S GOING ON YET. ALL I KNOW IS I'VE GOT SOMETHING HERE. AND MR. CALDWELL IS CRAZY IF HE DOESN'T THINK I'M GONNA USE IT TO LEAN ON HIM FOR INFORMATION. WELL, STEVE DOESN'T HAVE ANY MORE INFORMATION. HE'S--HE'S JUST AS CONFUSED AS YOU. I DOUBT THAT. JUST TELL STEVE I NEED TO SEE HIM. AND TELL HIM I ALREADY HAVE ENOUGH TO TAKE AWAY HIS GUN AND HAVE HIS LICENSE SUSPENDED. YOU HAVE A NICE DAY, MA'AM. [CELL PHONE RINGS] [RING] YEAH. STEVE, HI, THIS IS JENNY. I JUST SPOKE TO OFFICER BRICE. SOMEBODY SENT HIM THAT SURVEILLANCE TAPE OF A MAN IN A SECURITY GUARD'S UNIFORM ROBBING ANGELA'S HOUSE. WHERE THE HELL DID HE GET THAT? I HAVE IT. I DON'T KNOW. LOOK, WE NEED TO TALK. MEET ME BACK AT THE OFFICE. GIVE ME AN HOUR OR SO. I'VE GOT A FEW STOPS TO MAKE. [BEEPING STEADILY] I REALLY SCREWED UP, WILL. I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW THIS WHOLE THING GOT STARTED, BUT I'M IN WAY OVER MY HEAD HERE. AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN ETHICS IN THIS BUSI-- I KNOW THERE ARE CERTAIN... CERTAIN LINES THAT YOU JUST DON'T CROSS OVER, BUT... THE REAL WORLD IS SO DIFFERENT. [MURMURING] ENOUGH ALREADY. PUT A LID ON IT, WILL YA? YOU'RE TALKING MY EAR OFF. YOU'RE AWAKE?! YEAH, I WOKE UP A FEW HOURS AGO. THERE WAS NOBODY HERE, SO I WENT BACK TO SLEEP. OH, SWEET JESUS. YOU JUST SCARED THE LIFE OUTTA ME. YOU JUST HEARD EVERYTHING I SAID? HEH. EVERY WORD. WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK? I THINK YOU GOT SOME SORTING OUT TO DO. YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO IT SITTING THERE TALKING TO ME. JUST TRUST YOUR HEART, STEVE. WELL, WELL. WHAT A SURPRISE. I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU. CAN I COME IN, PLEASE? WELL, I'M SURE YOU CAN. BUT...YOU MAY NOT. [BOTH LAUGH CYNICALLY] YOU'RE A REAL BASTARD, YOU KNOW THAT? I KNOW. JUST HURRY UP WITH WHATEVER IT IS YOU HAVE TO SAY. I'M A BUSY MAN. LISTEN, I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH ANGELA, AND I WAS THINKING THAT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS FOR ME. WELL, THINK AGAIN, PAL. I CAN'T HELP YOU. AND IF I COULD... GOSH, I WOULDN'T. GODDAMN YOU. I'M SO SICK OF YOUR ATTITUDE. YOU TELL ME WHAT IT IS THAT YOU KNOW, OR, I SWEAR TO GOD, YOU'RE DEAD. YOU KNOW, YOU'VE WORN OUT YOUR WELCOME. I'M GONNA GO INSIDE, AND I'M GONNA CALL THE POLICE. GOOD-BYE. [TIRES SCREECH] I DON'T THINK THAT WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO KEEP THIS AS CLEAN AS WE ORIGINALLY INTENDED. WELL, HELLO. LOOK WHO'S HERE. SARA HAS SOMETHING SHE NEEDS TO TELL YOU, STEVE. OK, LET'S HEAR IT. I HATE YOU FOR KILLING ROY! HEY! CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN. DON'T TELL ME TO CALM DOWN! ANGELA NEVER LOVED YOU! SHE JUST USED YOU TO GET TO ROY! YOU'RE FULL OF SHIT. NOW, I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT ME. I JUST WANNA CLEAR MY CONSCIENCE. [CRYING] ROY WANTED TO MAKE SOME MONEY. HE FOUND OUT THAT ANGELA WAS TAPING HER SESSIONS, AND HE SAW IT AS A PERFECT OPPORTUNITY. SHE HAD HIM CONVINCED THAT SHE WANTED TO COOPERATE, BUT THAT YOU WERE THE ONE THAT WAS MAKING IT DIFFICULT. WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH THE SECURITY GUARD UNIFORM? SHE JUST DID THAT TO THROW OFF THE COPS. WHY DIDN'T ANGELA GO TO THE POLICE SOONER? BECAUSE...ROY KNEW SOMETHING ABOUT HER. A SECRET. WHAT? ANGELA WAS A HIGH-PRICED CALL GIRL IN LAS VEGAS. WHAT?! Sara: OH, BUT THAT'S NOT ALL. ROY FOUND OUT THAT ANGELA NEVER GOT A DEGREE. SHE WAS PRACTICING WITHOUT A LICENSE. HOW DID HE KNOW THAT? BECAUSE I TOLD HIM. I USED TO WORK WITH ANGELA. YOU WERE BLACKMAILING HER? YES. AND ROY KEPT... ROY KEPT RAISING THE STAKES, AND I JUST PLAYED ALONG. YEAH, YOU PLAYED ALONG TILL HE GOT KILLED. NO, I LOVED ROY! YEAH, YOU LOVED ROY! YES, I LOVED ROY-- YEAH, YOU LOVED ROY THE NIGHT YOU CAME ON TO ME? I DIDN'T WANT TO COME ON TO YOU. THAT WAS ROY'S IDEA. HE WAS OUTSIDE TAKING PICTURES. HE JUST WANTED SOMETHING TO USE AGAINST YOU IN CASE HE NEEDED IT. [TELEPHONE RINGS] [RING] NIGHT EYES. IT'S ME. I NEED TO TALK TO YOU. SARA'S HERE. THEN I ASSUME YOU'VE HEARD ONE SIDE OF THE STORY. HOW ABOUT HEARING MINE? I THINK WE'VE BEEN THROUGH ENOUGH WHERE I AT LEAST DESERVE THAT. OK, FINE. EXPLAIN IT. NOT NOW. HOW ABOUT COMING OVER? WHEN? AN HOUR? I'LL SEE YOU IN AN HOUR. THAT WAS ANGELA. I GOTTA GO TALK TO HER. STEVE, YOU CAN'T DO THIS. LISTEN TO ME. I HAVE AN IDEA. WE HAVE TO ACT REAL QUICK. [DING-DONG] MMM... MMM-- HEY. STOP. WHY? YEAH, COME ON INSIDE. WE'RE GONNA TALK. WHAT?! JUST ANSWER ME A QUESTION. SARA SAID THAT YOU WERE USING ME TO GET RID OF ROY. JUST TELL ME, IS THAT TRUE? I ONLY WISH I WAS CLEVER ENOUGH TO COME UP WITH A SCHEME LIKE THAT. I ASSURE YOU, I AM NOT. BUT I AM. WHAT THE...? WELL, GEE, SOMEONE NEEDED TO PLAY THE PART OF THE BAD GUY. IT WAS TO GET YOU RILED UP, STEVE. MAKE THAT TRIGGER FINGER START ITCHING. ANY GOOD SCAM REQUIRES A MAN ON THE INSIDE. WHO DO YA THINK SENT THE COPS THOSE TAPES? WHY WOULD YOU DO IT, THOUGH? OH, MONEY. I NEEDED A LOT REAL BAD. REAL BAD. AND ANGELA HERE... WELL, SHE MADE ME AN OFFER THAT... I JUST COULDN'T REFUSE. HOW COULD YOU DO THIS? SELF-PRESERVATION. I WASN'T ABOUT TO LET THAT SCUMBAG ROY TAKE EVERYTHING THAT I WORKED SO HARD FOR. UH, TELL ME SOMETHING, STEVE, BEFORE I KILL YOU, HOW WOULD YOU RATE MY PERFORMANCE? SHOULD I HAVE BEEN AN ACTOR? TCH. OH, YOU'RE SO NAIVE. YOU ACTUALLY THOUGHT I LOVED YOU? PLEASE! YOU COULD'VE GOT OUT OF THIS WHOLE THING WITHOUT A MARK IF YOU HADN'T DECIDED TO PLAY SHERLOCK HOLMES. WELL, NOW THINGS ARE GONNA BE FAR LESS PLEASANT. WHY ME, ANGELA? 'CAUSE YOU WERE THERE. I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS. SHOULDN'T WE GO IN THERE? WHO THE HELL IS THAT? [KEYPAD BEEPS] Haynes: LOOKS LIKE ALEX STEIN. THE LATE-NIGHT GUY? YEAH. LET'S GET IN THERE. [STARTS ENGINE] [POUNDING ON DOOR] [POUNDING] ANGELA, WHY IN THE HELL HAVEN'T YOU RETURNED MY CALLS? I'M IN DIRE STRAITS HERE. Angela: IT'S REALLY NOT A GOOD TIME RIGHT NOW. OH, REALLY?! WELL, YOU'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO TELL YOUR LITTLE FRIEND TO TAKE A POWDER! YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COME BACK TOMORROW. NO, WE'RE GONNA TAKE CARE OF THIS RIGHT NOW, ANGELA! HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN THE SITUATION I'M IN? EVERYTHING'S OK. I FIXED IT. HOW CAN YOU BE SO SURE ABOUT THAT? SHUT UP, YA LITTLE TWERP! IS THAT THE GUY? IS THAT THE BLACKMAILER? NO. I SAID SHUT UP! DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM? YOU KNOW SOMETHING? I DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE! FREEZE! I DON'T THINK SO. LOSE THE GUNS... OR I'M GONNA KILL THIS GUY. KEEP IT RIGHT ON HIM. ONE MOVE, AND HE'S DEAD. DROP THE GUN. Haynes: OK, LET'S GO. GOOD JOB. NOT COUNTING ON CHARLES HALE. SOMETIMES YOU GET LUCKY. DID YOU MAKE THE VIDEO. RIGHT HERE. ONE FULL HOUR OF SARA OUTLINING THE ENTIRE TAWDRY STORY. JIMMY'LL LOVE IT. WELL... YOU DID A REAL GOOD JOB. BOTH OF YOU. THIS MIGHT INTEREST YOU. I'M NOT IN THIS ONE. HEH. IT SHOULD EXPLAIN EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW. THANKS. THE DOCTOR SAYS THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE GETTING OUT OF HERE IN ANOTHER WEEK OR SO. SOUNDS LIKE YOU GUYS HANDLED THINGS PRETTY WELL WITHOUT ME. I'M BEGINNING TO THINK YOU DON'T NEED ME ANYMORE. NOW, WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? I'M GONNA GO BACK TO KNOXVILLE. ARE YOU SERIOUS? WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO THERE? MIGHT GO INTO COUNTRY MUSIC. YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS A KID, PEOPLE TOLD ME I HAD A GREAT SINGING VOICE. WILL, THEY LIED TO YOU. THEY LIED TO YOU. GUYS, I'M KIDDING, OK? BUT IT IS TIME FOR ME TO GO BACK HOME. YOU ARE SERIOUS. [SIGHS] MY HEART'S JUST NOT IN IT ANYMORE. I REALLY AM GONNA MISS YOU GUYS. WELL, I'M HAPPY FOR YOU, WILL, BUT... I'M GONNA MISS HAVING YOU AS A BOSS. SAME GOES HERE. SO I WAS THINKING MAYBE THE TWO OF YOU MIGHT WANT TO TAKE OVER NIGHT EYES FOR ME. WHAT? WELL, COME ON. YOU'VE DONE A PRETTY GOOD JOB HANDLING THINGS WITHOUT ME. Will: WHAT DO YOU SAY? SOUNDS GOOD TO ME. WILL, I WOULD BE HONORED. OH, MAN. GODDAMN, YOU DRIVE, PARTNER. YOU GOT IT. A SINGER, HUH? WELL, YOU NEVER KNOW.
