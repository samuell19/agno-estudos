The young people of today have to be careful not to get trap in a desperate quest for love. Welcome to the Light. We acknowledge every young person's right to be happy. We can guarantee you will find your one and only soulmate here. The future is bright and it's waiting for you. Join the Light, and we'll bring out the light in you. Oh, I got chills. I bet it was the narrator's voice that got to you. It's so fatherly. Yeah. Every time I see you post pictures of you and your dad, I'm always jealous. I've never had moments like those. Of course, Ulfah would post pics with her dad. She doesn't have anything else she could upload. Well, life isn't fair, Tara. I've long accepted that. I actually wanna trade places with you, Ul. Then I wouldn't have to stress over replying to all the comments. The point is, at the Light… we're gonna find everything we've been searching for. And we, three, can always be together. I'm just grateful that I was chosen to join the Light along with my childhood best friends. Almost all girls dream of getting married with an ideal wedding in mind. In an era as uncertain as this, young people like us have been forced to give up on our dreams. And although the pandemic is over, our possibilities are still limited. Are we almost there? I'm getting nervous. Like me, a lot of people have never had the privilege of observing the beauty of forest and nature. Wow. The last time I saw a scenery as fresh and green like this was seven years ago. My mom told me that after the pandemic, it's like the world rapidly aged. I guess that's why she's depressed. All right, I'm Salina. My late father taught me not to be afraid to go after my dreams. The Light has to as be beautiful as this, right? -Are you okay? -What's going on? -Hey. -Did we run off on something? What's going on? -What is that? -What's happening? Oh, my goodness. Let's get her up. -Are you okay? -I'm all right. I wasn't actually hit. -I was just shocked when I saw the bus… -Did you get hurt? …and fell. I'm fine. Don't worry about me. -Can you walk with her, sir? -No need, I'm fine. It's okay. Here, let me help. Watch your step. There's nothing to see here. Be careful, Grandma. You should be careful too. Okay? Yes, Grandma. Okay, come on, let's go. Let's get going. I truly believe that the Light will make all of my dreams a reality. We have arrived at the Light Training Center. Please get off the bus in an orderly manner. -We will take care of your luggage… -Welcome. See you later. Good morning. -I'm Santi, and this is my husband, Iwan. -Good morning. I'll be taking your picture. Look here, please. Look at the camera. So pretty. CLASS OF JANUARY 2030 REGISTERED Okay. You guys are free to explore. Event starts in 15 minutes. Use the map I've sent to you. Don't get lost. We will. Thank you. I can't believe we're here. This is it, guys. Looks so cool. Welcome, Salina. You are now officially a part of the Light family. From now on, we will do everything in our power to make your dreams and aspirations come true. Welcome to the Light… Welcome, Hafiz. By becoming a part of the Light, you don't need to worry about anything any more. Everyone here is equal. We do not discriminate between the rich and the poor. Welcome to the Light, Tara. Everyone is welcome here and that's regardless of their past. How much do they know about us? I bet they did a ton of research on every applicant before accepting anyone. So how come they still want me? Isn't that a good thing? Yeah, I supposed so. Did you know that 20 percent of all profits from my make up line gets donated to charities for people with disabilities? As such, you can join us and fight the good fight by swiping right, right now. Oh, he's so cute. How adorable. Excuse us. Ul, let's go. Oh, sorry. This is the reality your generation has to face. The aftermath of the pandemic from ten years ago. Plastic waste continues to contaminate our seas and our lands. It is polluted most of the planet's soil, making a large part of our land hazardous and unhabitable. At this rate, even our oceans will die. Global warming is already at its absolute peak. The quality of life of all living beings is critically below standards. The global birthrate has been drastically declining, as opposed to the global death rate which has been on the rise. Will the human race be able to survive? Only at the Light can you be pioneers of real and lasting change. Take charge of your future. And the future is now! Welcome everyone to the Light. Each of you came here with a clear purpose. And I know what it is. To train, to be fantastic. And to be the best version of yourself. Aren't those just lovely words to hear? All right. Now repeat after me. To train and to be the best version… of myself. Everybody on my cue. To train and to be the best version of myself! Whoo! However, in order for you to reach such a lofty goal, you would need a support system. Alone, you cannot have a sustainable future. You have to be married, dating is not enough. You need an ideal spouse. But there's no reason to fret. At the Light, we have prepared everything for you. Now, I'd like to present my support system with pride. The one who has always been by my side. My lovely wife. Sofia. Ooh. Around ten years ago, the prototype of the matchmaking system I invented led us to each other. Good morning, everyone and welcome. I know it took determination to come here. After all, you are at an age when your hormones are raging. But then again, this is the perfect time to train yourselves in both abstinence and control. Yes. Remember. Control. Control your carnal desires and resist the urge to date. Because soon all of you here will be married to someone we guarantee to be your perfect match. And rest assured, each of your future spouses is right here in this training center. But if any of you are still doubtful… Well, that's normal. Does anyone want to share their feelings? Please don't hesitate and raise your hand if you want to share. We're here to listen to you. Ah. Salina. Thank you for raising your hand. I'm guessing you three… are best friends? I notice that Tara, the one sitting in the middle has been looking down. Is there anything wrong? Tar? Excuse me. Tara? It's okay. I'm sorry. I just… I just… I don't think that I deserve to be here. Why is that? Because… I have been dating since… I was in sixth grade. I switched boyfriends around a lot. I'm not here to judge you, Tara. No one is. Can you tell me what your biggest wish is right now? Right now? If it's possible… I really want to apologize to… all of those that I've hurt. But that's not possible anymore. Shh. Okay. Whatever happened in your past… the only way you can move forward is to forgive yourself, Tara. Do you want to forgive yourself and move on? Mm-hmm. Okay. Tara needs our help. So I would like each and everyone in this room… to stand up and give her our support. We should send her some positive energy. Everybody, close your eyes. And then, raise your right hand and put it on your chest. Concentrate. Feel the rhythm of your heart as it beats against your chest. Now inhale… …and exhale. Get in touch with your heart and slowly whisper to it. Tell your heart that you will forgive yourself for all of your past mistakes. Let go. Whenever you're ready. You may open your eyes. Take your time. Okay. Start with a clean slate. Feel better? That's good. Salina. Thank you so much for being an excellent friend to Tara. Now I want to ask you a question. Will you be able to let everyone at the Light into your heart including me… and think of us as your new family? How do you feel? Feeling better? I've decided to move on. I only hope that in time, those who got hurt in that accident would find the heart to forgive me for what I've done. Your ex Andi was the one driving, not you. I know, but I was kissing him, that's why he lost control of the wheel. Tar… Just remember what Ali said to us earlier. We're staring with a clean slate. Now I feel relieved, Na. It makes me happy seeing you calm. Today, I feel so protected, it's like I have a dad again. Ali's future child is sure going to be very lucky. This is the first time that I haven't felt insecure. Whoever my match will be… I'm ready. Ah, you're so lucky to be the first to turn 17, Ul. It's going to be wonderful, Ul. Each of you have chosen and signed up for training programs in the fields you're most passionate about. We prepared the best mentors for you. Until you get married, you'll be staying in the girls' dormitory which will be supervised by Miss Nanik. You can think of her as a mother for the duration of your stay. I will now read to you the dorm's house rules. This is the first rule. Always keep your rooms clean and tidy. Our Esteemed Leader Ali Khan built these accommodations and facilities for us. It's our responsibility to maintain them. Second rule. Everyone is expected to get up and get ready at 5 a.m. Good morning, Tara, it's already 5:05. Third rule. There is one mandatory class for all members, regardless of their program. And that is home economics or household arts. Fourth rule. In order to protect you from lustful urges, it is strictly forbidden to meet with members of the opposite sex unless necessary for work. Finally, you can use our shuttle vans, but only if you need them to complete your assignments. And everyone is obligated to return to their dormitories by 8 p.m. You will only live here for a maximum of a year. That will be until you turn 17 and get married. That is all. After getting married, you will be asked to move and live independently in apartments built specially by the Light. And with this, you will become property owners, which is a rare privilege in these precarious times. Optimize the teachings of the Light, and spread them to your families, your friends and the world. Women activist groups are gathering signatures for a petition to raise the age in which teenagers are allowed to legally marry in the country. It is currently at 17 and they want it to be at 19. On the other hand, the Light, which is an educational institution that provides training for the youth led by the handsome and charismatic Ali Khan, has been successful in gathering a large number of signatures to maintain the previously set legal age for marriage at 17 years old. Have you notice how all the news outlets always use the words "handsome" and "charismatic" to describe you these days? Turn around, please. This is our third attempt. Let's hope it works this time. Okay. Stay still. You're almost there. Okay. Remember. This is a test for us. Our child is going to be perfect. My beauty troops. Today, our training will be about how should you present yourselves on social media as a person who's been reborn. Let's start by redefining beauty as something healthy and natural. In front of you are several of our products. Feel free to make captions and take photos as you will. The only thing I ask is that you include the hashtag #BeautyAlaSofia. But before anything else, you would have to change all of your current profile pictures. Apart from that, you would have to delete all your pre-existing social media feeds. We want to start over with a clean slate. Tara. I know that you have the most followers out of everyone here. I'm guessing this is hard for you to do. It's okay. I'll create a new makeup line especially for girls like you with darker skin. Do you want to help me develop it? Seriously? It's an honor. I really wanna give you a hug right now, Sofia. You can't. Not here. It's confidential. Okay? Okay. Today we're going to the city to take shots for content. -After that, we'll come back here. -Good morning, everyone! -Good morning, sir! -Morning. Joko Liauw! I must have watched his documentary on the origins of the pandemic a thousand times. I'd like to welcome you to our media lab. I understand you have chosen to become the Light's content creators. Keep this in mind. The media is our strength and our power. And content, good content is our primary weapon. Now, I do believe the man next to me needs no introductions. Your job consists of creating content that can garner plenty of likes. The one who succeeds and getting the most likes, will be generously rewarded. He or she will get to work with me. In what I could only describe as a prestigious documentary project. -That's right. -That would be… as CD. Now what's a CD? Co-director. What do you have to do? That depends. If I'm not in the mood, then you would have to do the job in my stand. If I get lost or confused on how to direct some scenes, then you'd have to think for me. So this is about teamwork. Right. That's the most important thing. Because teamwork, however small, is the key in order to succeed. -Best of luck! -Thank you! Thank you! Do your best, everyone! Okay. So, listen Joko… You heard them. Let's go. Make teams of two. Once you've found your teammate, follow me. Come on, hurry. We don't have a lot of time. I'll do the editing. Is that all right? That's fine. I prefer filming. Let's go. All right, spread out. Be back in two hours. Okay? Make shots of any immoral behaviors. Like dating couples holding hands or girls wearing miniskirts. -Okay? -Okay. Got it. -All right, guys, get to it. Come on. -This is utterly ridiculous. Never mind. Let's do what we can. VERBAL ABUSE IS NOT TRIVIAL ISSUE Salina? Hi, do I know you? I was your senior in middle school. I can't believe you joined the Light. Uh, sorry, I'm busy with an assignment. Wait. Hang on a second. I managed to leave the Light. Don't believe their propaganda. Get out before it's too late. If you don't believe me, then see for yourself. Look about the Arya Teja online! Who are you? -Oh, sorry, it's for school assignment. -What do you want? -We're supposed to-- -Well, I really don't care. -This bitch was filming us. -Hey! This man is my husband! -I'm so sorry! No, forgive me! -Go, go screw yourself! You stupid bitch! You ill-mannered piece of shit. Show some respect. I'm sorry. Please stop. This needs your magic touch, Hafiz. Please make it work. I'm sorry. I couldn't get anything good. Relax. I can combine this with my footage. But didn't you only get shots of posters on the wall? Just wait. Good evening! You have anything new for me? Yes, we do. Surprise me. Go screw yourself, you stupid bitch. Show some respect. I'm so sorry. No, forgive me! You ill-mannered piece of shit! -I'm sorry, I'm sorry… -You stupid bitch. Go screw yourself. I don't know what to say. Fantastic, fantastic! This is what I'm saying. Little piece of advice. Artist should never be afraid to explore different styles. Improvise. Improvise. Just to let you know our admins will only upload the best of the best, the cream of the crop. Okay? Great. Keep working. Hey, Iwan. Perfect. All right, guys, improvise. Any new ideas? Thank you, Fiz. It's slippery here, Ul. Watch your step. The practice lounge is overflowing with almonds. But I just couldn't bring myself to eat all of them. Why not, Ul? You can eat all the almonds you want while you're here. But they cost like an arm and a leg in the city. You're right. Almonds are among the most popular items in my Light Mart. Oh. I think it will be more popular if we repackage them. If you have design ideas for the packaging, you should draw them. We can present them to The Esteemed later. We're allowed to do that? But of course. Oh, my husband brought our son with him. Oh, how nice, you get to come home with your husband and son. Oh, hello, you cute little thing. Hi there, honey. -What's his name, Reny? -Edy. Hello, baby Edy. Oh. You're so cute! Mm. -Oh, you. -Easy. You'll be a mother soon enough, Ul. I hope so. Bye. See you again. -Bye, Reny. -Bye. Take care. Can I sit here? Hello. I got you girls a present. Thank you, Tar. Are you sure you can give these away? Of course, I can. Besides, I'm the only trainee Sofia gave extra bottles to. Hey. Listen, I have a confession to make. The truth is, I feel so at home here already. And surprisingly, I don't miss dating. I knew it, Tar. And I love your new image on social media. Wait, I haven't seen it yet. A lot of people unfollowed me because of it. Some even bashed me for being part of the Light. But at the end of it all, I gained more followers. Just ignore them. There's bound to be haters trying to bring down the Light. That's right. Where is my boy genius? Welcome, Father. Oh. The house looks great. I really like what you've done with the place. Sofia. You have such good taste. Why thank you, Father. I can feel it, son. I'm certain your establishment will usher in an age of revolution. But we're still in the early stages. I've watched since you were a little boy. And I've always known you will become a great leader. It's way too soon to tell. We've only started planting the seeds after all. And soon you'll reap a plentiful harvest. Don't look down all the time. -You'll slip and fall. -Uh, wait a second, Hafiz. Our new video got uploaded!. I may have gained a little weight, but thankfully my husband doesn't mind. -Aww! -Yeah, that's nice. You should check out the comments too. You'll get a kick out of it. -Salina, let's go. -Sure, give me a sec. I'll be right there. So this is where you ran off to. "That's sweet. I really wanna be in a relationship like theirs." "Sign me up. How do I apply to the Light?" "Whoa, couple goals." "Blessed this perfect couple. Just looking at them gives me joy and…" You're having too much fun at the comments. -"I love this!" -Hafiz, please stop! Wait. Cameras? You're so mean. You almost gave me a heart attack! Na? Hey. -Stop being silly. -Hey. Ul, try not to look so gloomy. You should be more confident. Their concepts are quite interesting. You mean like this? The makeup's great. Tara did a good job. You look very pretty, Ulfah. It's all thanks to the make-up artist. Look, you're really glowing, Ul. There, that's it! Just like that, Ul! Hold that pose. Don't forget what you're going to say and action! -Hello. I am-- -Cut, cut, cut! Hafiz! Hey! Do you have an extra memory card? Mine's already full. Look, Ul. I bet that guy is Salina's match. But he looks like a nerd. How come you have to borrow a memory card from someone else, Na? I thought you always had an extra with you. I did bring one, but it's broken. Okay, Ulfah, stand by. I've been standing by for ages. Action. Hello, my name is Ulfah… Okay, everyone in the men sports team, it's our turn. If anybody needs help with their make-up, I'm here. Tara. Don't tempt yourself. Okay, stand by, Ulfah. And action! Hello, my name is Ulfah. In a few days, I'll be turning 17 and I'm ready for my match. There you are. I've been looking for you. I've been waiting here for you. Oh, I'm sorry about before, Ulfah and Tara haven't outgrown their habit of making fun of me. Oh, I don't mind. I had fun watching you girls tease and bully each other. I know right, they always make up all kinds of stuffs. Oh, so you're saying that was made up? Hmm? What if… what they said was actually true? What exactly do you mean? I see. So you miss dating that much, huh? -Hey, Fiz. -Hey. To be honest with you… I'm already 17 but… I've never had a girlfriend. I've always wanted to know how it feels like to date someone. There's nothing special about it. I've dated but I don't miss it. When's your birthday anyway? On the day I got here. Oh. Good for you then. You'll be getting married soon. Well, I'm just waiting for it. I mean, lots of guys here turns 17 a while back, yet they're still single. I suppose… they haven't found the right partner. Fiz, what you're doing is forbidden. I'm already sure that you're the one for me. How can you be so sure? I've known it… since I saw you step down from the bus to help that old lady. I'm certain because you are so sincere when you praised me on my editing. I know you come from a rich family… but you have empathy and ambition. You're not lazy. And you actually put effort into things. Don't you feel the same way I do, Na? That we're meant to be? I'm just afraid to expect too much happiness, Fiz. I'M ON THE WAY FOR TAKING SUNRISE'S STOCKS I'M ALREADY HERE WAITING YOU Let's set up here. Okay. What do you think is going on in the city? I don't care, it's better here. Do you miss living in the city at all? Well, I do miss my mother… my father. I imagined when we're married… and living at our own place, they're going to be so proud to see their son with a cool wife like you. Your imagination's running too wild. Just live in the present. Enjoy what's in front of you. I do enjoy it. Hopefully, your parents will be proud of me too. I'm sure my late father would have been proud. Once we move to the apartment, we won't get this view anymore. I'll make up for it. I'll be your view. It's actually near here. And I'll have to be there too. See you later. Where have you been, Salina? Did you get the candles? Yes, of course I did. Would you relax, Tar? -Can I have a little taste? -Hey. ACCORDING TO YOUR CHOSEN FIELD YOU WILL MANAGE THE LIGHT MART DESIGN AFTER GETTING MARRIED Oh, thank you, you guys are so sweet. Wait. Make a wish first. Okay. Yay! So how's the bride-to-be feeling? Are you nervous? More than that, I'm happy the day has come. Oh. By the way. Miss Nanik sent me an email. Take a look. This is how my store is going to look like. Awesome! So how does it feel? I mean, you're going to marry a guy you've never even met? I'm just worried about our first night together. Is it going to hurt? Don't worry about it, Ul. Let go. Relax. Can you guys sleepover? I mean, after all, it's my last night here. Please. Tar. -Tar, do you dare? -I'm sorry, I can't. I haven't succeeded in leaving Sofia with a good impression of me yet. So I can't afford any blemish on my record. Oh, yeah. -Shh. -Salina. You are being loud. She looks so beautiful. She looks so lovely. With the help of our matchmaking system, on this day, we can bear witnesses, two fated souls meet and tied the knot in this beautiful and most sacred place. Here we go. I thought he was gonna be paired with you, Na, Ulfah and Hafiz. We're going to celebrate their holy matrimony today. Hafiz. Do you accept Ulfah whom we've chosen to be your wife and vow to stay with her till death do you part? Trust me. She's the best match for you, Hafiz. I do, Esteemed Leader. -Hey, Na, are you okay? -Ulfah, do you accept Hafiz whom we've chosen to be your husband? and vow to stay with him till death do you part? -I do, Esteemed Leader. -Fantastic. By the power vested in me by the Light, I pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride, Hafiz. Congratulations. -Esteemed Leader. -Please don't mind me. Carry on. I came to tell you you've been chosen as Joko Liauw's co-director. It's for our special documentary film project. Wow, thank you so much. Thank you for this oppoturnity. You're most welcome. Here. No need to be so tense. You're pushing yourself. You shouldn't work too hard. You need to take care of yourself too. I hope it's all right to ask. Uh… What's the documentary about? About me. Oh. All right. Rest assured, I will not disappoint you, Esteemed Leader. Rest up. FIZ! I HAVE BEEN CHOSEN… There's not a lot of room upstairs. I don't think all my stuff would fit in there. Let's put them in the stock room. That should be fine until we get a bigger apartment once we have children. Yeah, sure. I'll head upstairs first. Aren't you going to help me put the products on the shelves? Tomorrow morning. When will your parents visit us? I wanna get to know them. Let's wait until we fix this place up. Na. Oh, my God, Na. They just uploaded the video from Hafiz and Ulfah's wedding. -It's so cool. Here. -I've already seen it. -I mean it. -I know. But still, Na, don't you wanna see how beautiful she was again? And even Hafiz was looking fine with his brand new haircut, -and he's dashing in his suit. -Mm. Yeah, yeah, yeah. -Na, are you okay? -What are you trying to say, Tara? I'm trying to say that Ulfa and Hafiz don't seem to have anything in common. -As compared to you and him. -Jeez. We just work together, okay? Don't get the wrong idea. -Hey, chill. Don't get all defensive. -What are you saying? At any rate, I have to keep focus on a new project. It's a documentary on the life of The Esteemed Leader. Wow, that's amazing. Do me a favor. Find out who my match is. I gotta go. I need to pee. NA, MY MARRIAGE IS ONLY OBLIGATION. YOU MUST KNOW MY LOVE IS ONLY FOR YOU. I read the test results. They look good. We can start the process of transferring the embryo to your uterus. Okay? Okay. Are you ready for the camera? Yes, I am. Get all the shots you need. Ready, Ms. Sofia? -Let's wait for Al to come back. -Not a problem. Take the book with you. You can keep it. Okay. -Thank you, Esteemed Leader. -Sure, no problem. I want you to capture mine and Sofia's every moment. I want the audience to relate to us. -Doc, we'll be filming the procedure. -Yes? Is there a problem? Sure, go ahead. Just relax. We'll begin shortly. Face it towards me please. Now, slowly inhale. Control your breathing. Good. Keep it steady, Sofia. That's so sad. It's such a tragedy when parents lose their child. They overcame it together, Tara. This is all confidential, okay? People are trusting me with this project. Mm-hmm. It's almost 8 p.m. Oh, relax. They're still busy living the glam life like a king and his queen. My couple goals. I'M BACK TO WORK SOON, CAN'T WAIT TO BE WITH YOU IN EDITING LAB. PLEASE REPLY, NA. DELETE CHAT ARE YOU SURE? DELETE We have supplements for athletes. We also have a sustainable food chain, which is Light Mart. As well as an eco-friendly fashion line and of course, beauty products. And now, allow me to show you, the Beauty Lab of the Light. Ladies, today we're gonna conduct different tests with our latest product. -Okay, let's get to work. -Okay. At the Light, we have facilities for various endeavors. This is one of them. Good morning, everyone. I apologize for interrupting your work. I just wanna say Sofia sends her regards. But there's no need to worry, I'm sure you'll learn a lot from Tara here, right? Oh, wow. This is quite unusual. I never imagined our Esteemed Leader would be stopping by to grace us with his presence. All right, why don't we take a selfie. Is that all right? Okay. -Salina, you should join us. -No, thanks. -Na. -Come on. Don't just stand there. Come here, join the fun. Let's take a photo with everybody. Come closer. Okay. Hey, Santi, get in here. Okay, a little closer, please. Just a bit. Ready. One, two… and three. Hey. Na? Can I preview your cut? Just relax. We'll begin it shortly. Now, slowly inhale. -Control your breathing. -There are no interviews yet. But I'm sure it will turn out great. I'm quite surprised. I wasn't expecting this. Good job. I'm taking a break. Wow, the interior's so cute, Ul. -Very Ulfah, right? -Hey, guys! Mm. -Sali. -Hey, Ul. First things first. Have you done it already? It's awesome, right? It's… it hurts a bit at first. But Hafiz was gentle, and he turned out to be sweet. Watch over him? You're together a lot at work. I don't understand. He keeps skipping lunch at work. It's so unhealthy. -Oh. -Please remind him to eat. All right, no problem. Oh, how's the documentary going? You're amazing. You get to work on such an important project. Dreams come true, Ul. I get to tag along on all of the leader's activities. It's exhausting but very rewarding. But you know what… something felt off about him yesterday… Really? Why? What happened? The leader touched me. He caressed my cheek. Did you manage to get that on camera, Na? He couldn't keep his hands to himself. Oh, come on, Tar, he was just being attentive. He's harmless. Don't overreact. Come on. Let's just shoot. Are you ready? Smile, Ul. And action! Chief Ali, Sofia, congratulations. I heard you're expecting. Thank you, Endru. But I hope you'll keep this to yourself for now. It's still early. We don't want to jinx it. Oh. Noted, ma'am. All right. Looks good. Okay. So are there any other couples we could send off to get married? Miss Nanik. Diana and Doni. Diana is very skilled when it comes to sewing but sadly, she can't draw. Doni is a talented artist. He draws comics. I think they're compatible. They'll do well together. -They'll be very productive. -Agreed. Who do we have next? Tara's supposed to be next, but it's going to be difficult to find a match for her. She's a good asset for us. She's influential with lots of followers. I think Tara is too progressive for someone her age. On her own, she was able to create a digital marketing plan for our Sofia Make-up line. I don't think we have anyone here who would be a good match for her. Endru? How about taking a second wife? No. I can't do that to my wife, Chief. Oh, come on. Don't you want to have more children? -Tara can-- -Al. Endru's wife is battling cancer, don't you remember? Oh. Sorry, I forgot. Dru. It's okay, Chief. Uh, for the time being, how about we focus on Diana's wedding first? Finding Tara's match can wait. What did you shoot today? Their plans for the next wedding. Is it from my batch? Who is it? It was uncomfortable. I didn't expect… Ali to talk about polygamy like it was nothing. You're kidding me. You mean, it's possible to match us with the guy who's already married? -Yeah. -I can't believe it. Where's the file? Come on, show it to me. I already sent it for editing. I don't have a good feeling about this. That's why you should always keep a copy. You should bend the rule sometimes, Na. I know, I know. Na, I understand if you want to have your space. And I hope you'll still consider me as a friend and that would be good enough for me. You have to be careful. Don't forget to delete all of our chats and emails. Thanks for everything. DON'T WORRY, I ALWAYS DELETE ALL. WE'RE WRONG FOR HOPING TOO MUCH. I WILL EDIT MY FILM MYSELF. Whenever I come here, I always feel like I'm in some paradise. Hasn't it been a while since I last visited? -Indeed, it has, sir. -Yes. I think I've been too busy working for my constituents. I understand, sir. You are a busy man after all. But if you ever feel tired, like you have to recharge, or if ever you just need a refreshing change of scenery, for example, this place is always open for you, sir. Thank you, Ali. Without you, Mr. Frans, none of this would have ever been possible. Back when everyone else was skeptical… you, sir, were the only one brave enough to invest. Ali. I never expected anything in return. But now, I need a favor from you. Please find a suitable wife for one of my sons… Aditya. He's getting old. He's already 25 years old and I think that it's time for him to settle down. I might have the perfect solution. Tara. Tara. -Mm. -Wake up, Tara. Go and shower. Why? There's still five minutes left before five. You have to prepare early because you'll be having breakfast with the Esteemed Leader, Sofia, and your future husband. Since when did we start having this breakfast blind date thingy, Ms. Nanik? It's a new thing. We're only doing this because we found you a match. What's that about? Na! Maybe he's not a member of the Light. My bad karma keeps haunting me wherever I go even now that I'm here. How much more must I repent for it to leave me alone? Stop that. Don't be a drama queen. Just go meet him first. Okay? It was an amazing experience. All in all, it was tough, and we had to work hard to get through it. We'll leave you guys to it. Take advantage of this opportunity to get to know each other better. Tara, Aditya, I just know you two will become a special couple. I'm grateful for all of this. Thank you so much. Enjoy. HOW? FINALLY GOOD KARMA, MY FUTURE HUSBAND IS HANDSOME LIKE A MOVIE STAR. -So, Tara. -Yeah? Tell me about yourself. I am so glad they got together. All I have to do now is make Tara the spokesperson for my make-up. With this, our ties with Mr. Frans will become stronger. I've always known your gut is never wrong. -Of course. -Hey, careful. I want you to slow down, Sofia. And from now on, I don't want you to take on too much work. No problem. Tara will help us. UL, FINALLY SOF AND ALI GOT THE BEST MATCH FOR ME I MISS YOU, UL… READ THIS! HOPE YOU ARE HAPPY FOR ME. RICH, YOUNG, HANDSOME ENTREPRENEUR ADITYA FRANS PROFILE BY JAFAR KURSIDIN Hey. Hey. How was work? Did anything good happen? Nah. It's the same as usual. Don't you wanna know how my day went? Oh, yeah. How was it? I've been feeling sick all day. And now I can't stand your smell, Fiz. Will you take a shower? Are you so hungry, it can't wait? You poor thing. Thank you so much, Ali. Tara's a perfect fit or Aditya. This is for you. -The token of my appreciation. -Mr. Frans, there's no need. Please just think of it as a returning the favor to you. Ali, no matter the situation, cash is always important. Try to imagine a car, okay? This car represents your ambition. But it doesn't have any fuel. Can the car go without fuel? This cash right here can be your fuel. I'm sure Tara will not disappoint you. That's great. Well, we should go and greet our guests. Sofia, what the hell is Salina doing here? -Okay, I'll handle her. -Do it now! Salina. Yes? Delete the footage you shot just now. -I don't understand. Is something wrong? -Delete it now. Your only test today is to focus on Tara and Aditya. Not on us. Yes, ma'am. Na? Hello! Ulfah? Looking gorgeous. You look so different. Let's go congratulate Tar. -How are you, Ul? -Thank you for coming. I'm finding out married life isn't as easy as it seems. I know I shouldn't be saying this after everything. It's just that I don't think Hafiz is the one for me. Look, UI, it's probably not as bad as you think. You're just getting to know each other. It takes time. You'll get the hang of it soon. You're right. There's nothing to complain about. Actually, I have great news for you. Really? What is it? I'll tell you when we're with Tara. Look at her. Isn't she the luckiest? I mean, look at him. You have to admit Aditya is so hot. You know his father is the Light's major donor. He's a businessman and a politician. I think he's a powerful man. Congrats to the newlyweds. -Hi. -You look stunning. Mm. Finally, dreams do come true. Mine did too, Tar. I'm finally pregnant. Oh my god, Ul. How could you? It's my wedding day. And you're stealing my thunder. Congrats. I'm so happy for both of you. Hey, Adit. -Hon. -Hey, we're going. -Thank you for having us. -Yes? I'd like to introduce you to my dear childhood friends. Ulfah and Salina. -Thank you for coming. -Congrats. -Congrats. -Thank you so much. -We'd better head on. -Wait. Don't go home yet. Congrats, Tara. I'll see you later. -Ul. Have you congratulated her? -Hafiz. It took you a while to get here. -Sorry. -Come on. -The line was long. -Na. Where are you going? I still have work to do. I'm fine. -You go ahead. -All right. Do you wanna go home? NA, I JUST REALIZED I BECOME A DAD SOON. ULFAH'S BELLY IS GETTING BIG. I MISS EDITING WITH YOU, HOPE YOU GET THE BEST MATCH. Here. It's your clip-on mic. Can you put it on me? Okay. So where do you wanna start? Uh, I have a list of questions. First off, can you… Um, sorry. Relax. Relax. Uh… -Many kids my age… -Salina. Oh, right. Ready? I think teenagers… Um… specifically those in my generation would be more interested in the details of the love story before the Esteemed Leader and Sofia got married. There's no such story. Our love story only began after we got married. So when did the Esteemed Leader realized that Sofia was the one you were meant to spend your life with? When I was starting out, I presented a prototype of the matchmaking system that I developed to as many of my fellow student activists as I possibly could. Every one of them laughed at my ideas and made fun of me. But Sofia took me seriously. And look… at where we are now. Wow. Okay. Um… Now for the next question. Sorry. Is it all right if we talk about the funding of the Light? Funding? Salina. Instead of a boring subject like funding, why don't we talk about the things that define and shape our humanity? Such as the traumatic events we've experienced. All right. The reason why I believe everyone should have a partner they could build a family with… and that no one should be allowed to postpone or refuse the arrival of children in their lives… is because of Rama. He was our firstborn child. Living in the city after the pandemic, with all the pollution, the diseases, Rama wasn't able to survive. Meanwhile, the world completely neglected the right of babies to live. That irony urged me to take action. I totally understand how you feel, Esteemed Leader. Only those who had suffered loss would understand. Sofia! Sof! Sof! -I'm bleeding, Al. Ahh. -It's okay. It's okay. Let's go to the hospital right now. -No. -Sofia. I don't have the energy. I already called the doctor. Excuse me. Uh, is there anything I can do to help? Salina! Sorry. Please give us some privacy. Al, it's about time you listen to what I've been telling you. Our legacy can't end here. -Not like this. -Sofia, please don't go there. Don't think about that right now. We have bigger problems. -Look, Al-- -You need to recover. That's what matters. -But you have to start-- -Sofia. -Miss Sofia. -Please, doctor. Give us a moment. -Doc, my wife-- -Al, Al! When it comes to this, the choice is mine. Salina? Are you already asleep? Mm-hmm. What's wrong? It's not even 8 p.m. Sorry, ma'am. I just feel so exhausted today. Listen to me. I can imagine how traumatic it must be to witness the tragedy that struck the Esteemed Leader and Sofia. We are all mourning their loss. Just know that I'm always here for you. Especially since both your best friends are now married and can't spend as much time with you. You can talk to me. I just miss everyone so much. I miss Ulfah, Tara… and I feel sorry about what happened to Sofia. I know. Our poor Sofia. But you know as an aspiring filmmaker, you have to be strong and ready to face anything that can befall your subject no matter how difficult. I have to be strong. Our Esteemed Leader is very proud of you, Salina. And so is Mr. Joko. Honey, you are our pride here at the Light. Hello, hon. Hey. Honey. This is the new ad for Sofia's make-up line. It's going to be uploaded tomorrow, do you like it? It's good. It looks great. -Hon, can we not sleep yet? -What's the matter, Tar? Aren't we shooting for the Light tomorrow? We have to sleep. But your mom keeps reminding me that… I have to get pregnant soon. Don't worry about her, she's typically like that. Relax. Sofia. I hope you're feeling better. I'm fine, Salina. We shouldn't be talking about my miscarriage here. Focus on what you have to do for the documentary on the Esteemed Leader. And for now, what I want you to do is make a good video for Tara. -Okay? -Sure. Welcome, newlyweds! Thank you for coming! -Aww! -They're so sweet. They look good together, don't they? I consider it a great honor to be able to work in something I'm passionate about. Here in Sofia Make-up. I'm also proud to have a loving husband who supports me in my endeavors. I'm delighted to accompany my wife on her first day back at work. Work hard, girls, and you'll be just like them. If you also dedicate yourselves, and put it to hard work, somewhere down the line, it will all pay off. I am now a changed woman but for the better. I'm ready. -Uh… -How do you want it to do? Wait, Tara. Uh, hold on a second. -I'll go along with anything. -Tara, please, just wait. -Good evening, boss. -Leo. How do you want it done? -Hon? -You don't have to be scared. -I'll be watching over you. -No. -It's okay. -No. No. It's okay, Tar! -Tar, it's okay! -Ah! Hon! It's okay. It's okay. -Just relax. -Don't resist. No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! What did you do? Are you crazy? Are you fucking mad? Leo! No! -No. I think you killed him. -I hate you! -Fuck! -Fucking bastard! Tar, don't! Tar! Tara, open up! I think he's dead! What should we do? Good evening. Hi, Salina. We're not going to shoot today. Oh, I see. Oh, okay then. Look at you. You're not taking care of yourself. You're a mess. I'm sorry. It's because all I had on my schedule today was editing. So… Okay. I believe you're turning 17 soon, right? Yes, ma'am. And… just so you know, Salina. You're the only member we summoned here… …before they're 17. Yes. Only you. Have I done something wrong? Welcome to our little family. Will you marry us? Salina? Salina? Soon all of you here will be married to someone we guarantee to be your perfect match. When they were taking the sonogram, our baby hid. Probably like Hafiz. -He's very shy. -Probably shy just like dad. I'm strong enough to avoid the poison of romance. The same goes for my husband. We accepted each other. And rest assured, each of your future spouses is right here in this training center. Tara. Please, Tara, open up. Tara, listen. We can talk about it. Just open up, Tara. Tara, please! ARYA TEJA, YEAR 2028 OUR SON NEVER COME BACK FROM TL "Our son joined the Light. He got in without our consent. His name is Arya Teja, he's been missing since 2028. Ever since then, we haven't been able to contact him." Ah. Shit. Shit. Shit. THOSE WHO SUCCESSFULLY ESCAPED FROM TL "I somehow survived escaping from the Light. But when I got out, I still have friends inside, and until now I haven't received any news about where they are, how they're doing." Oh, shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Uh-huh. Okay. I see. Na. What is it, Na? Tara, Tara. I'm planning to escape from the Light, Tara. But we have to leave together. Na… -I… -I sent you a few articles. Check your email. Okay? Bring your car tomorrow before 12. Meet me at Ulfah's Light Mart. Okay? -Okay. -Okay. I'll have the payment ready. Thanks. Tara, it's been taken care of. Look, he's not dead. Don't be afraid, Tara. Just please open the door. Okay. Testing, testing. Stay tuned. I have more stories for you. Tar! Tara! Listen, I'm sorry, okay? You forgot this. You can't get in without it. It doesn't matter. Everyone already knows I'm your wife. They'll let me in if I want. Tara, is everything all right between us? Don't worry about it. Just forget it. Okay, drive safe. Na, why didn't you tell me you were coming this early? I emailed you a link. I guess you haven't seen it yet. Let's talk there. What's the matter? Ul, you know my birthday is coming up soon, right? Yes, I've been praying for you. Sofia and Ali… …they want to marry me off by then. -Ali has asked me to be his second wife. -Huh? -What the fuck? -They're insane. -Ul, I have to get out of here… -Yes, yes, I know. It is crazy. -…before that happen. -Just calm down, Na. Listen, you have to come with me. Trust me, you have to. Read the emails I sent you. It's about a former member who escaped. But his friends who were still inside suddenly went missing. I don't want to leave by myself, Ul. It's going to put both you and Tara at risk. They went missing? Please, Ul. -Wait, I'm getting dizzy. -Okay. Fiz, you know where my vitamins are? -Uh… -Have you seen them? They're at the back. Na, I'm sorry. I'll be back, okay? What was that, Na? They're going to make you his second wife? Huh? Motherfuckers! -I'll kill them! This is unacceptable! -Please, please calm down. Not so loud. Be quiet. Look, if you want to help me, edit out this documentary. Our own version. Okay? Forget about all that. It doesn't matter right now. Forget it, forget it! Na! Forget about all that. Never mind. We're gonna leave all of this behind together. I'm leaving with you. Period. Okay? What's this? What? What's going on, Hafiz? -Ul, listen, I can explain. -Ulfah, Salina and I love each other. -What the fuck, Fiz? Shut up! -Na? Ul, that was long before you got married. -It's over now. Please believe me. -Ulfa. Ulfa. You're a nice person, but you should know. -I don't feel the same way about you. -Shut up! Stop it! Stop it, Fiz! -Ul, please, you have to believe me. -Listen to me. Please, Ulfah. -Leave me alone! -Please. Ulfah, listen to me. -It was way before you were married. -Ulfah, you're a good person. -But you need to know the truth. -Leave me alone! Get the fuck out of here! Leave me and my baby alone! Get out! Get out! Ul, I'm so sorry, please hear me out! How could you? You're my best friend! Yes, I know, Ul, but we really have to leave! Ul! Ul! Salina, why don't you take a little break from work. Let's have brunch at the gazebo. Tara is here too. We'll wait for you. That's it? That's all you came here to say? Let me remind you, it's a wife's duty to serve her husband. But, Sofia, I never imagine that… serving my husband would include doing something like that. Your husband is Aditya. An heir to a big conglomeration. You know that, right? But what he did to me can be considered as domestic violence. You cannot tell anyone about your husband's flaws. But you're not just anyone, Sofia. Please hear me out. Help me. I don't want anything like this to happen again. No, you hear me. It's our role as wives to support our husbands, and it's our right to benefit from their power. It's all right, just make up with your husband, okay? I can't go back in there. I'm even traumatized of my own bed. I want to file a police report. Do you really think they're going to believe you? It's your word against his. Tara. You should be grateful, you know that. Although we try, we couldn't find a good match for you here. But Aditya… he was willing to accept you as his wife in spite of your wild dating history. I hate you, you fucking bitch! Okay. I guess I still have a lot to learn about gratitude. Well, just think of this as part of a long process. A process that would allow you to atone for all the sins you've committed in the past. Okay? NA, HURRY UP! I'VE BEEN WITH SOF, I LOST MY MIND… I'LL JUST SMACK THIS DRIVER, AND WE CAN ESCAPED Na? -Don't make a fuss. -What's going on? -You're coming with me. -Where are you taking me? -But, sir, why are you doing this? -Shut up. Salina. Move over, Tara. Would you? -Hello. -Hi. We've been waiting. Let's eat together. -We're escaping tonight. -How's Ulfah doing? She must be so happy since she is about to have a baby. You haven't told her anything yet, have you? Oh, Ulfah? She's well. She's as energetic as always. All right, so who's gonna break the news to Tara? Oh. I think you should do it. Okay. So then… let me read out the rundown for Salina and Ali's wedding ceremony. -What the fuck? -You'll walk down the aisle to the altar, and the screen showing our matchmaking system will come out and do the usual shuffling. And surprise. The Esteemed Leader's photo will pop up next to yours and the crowd will be amazed. So the system can be manipulated? Of course, all this is just for show. A show. I can tinker with the system how ever I want to. What is it, Endru? Um… We have a situation, ma'am. Well, what kind? We received information about Ulfah. Salina was just there and said she was fine. She has evidence that her husband's been unfaithful. You've got to be kidding me. Tara. Go ahead and give Salina the most special facial treatment. I'm going to handle this first. Okay? Salina, dinner tonight at our place, okay? These stupid kids. No, sir. Have mercy, please! -Please, sir. -Stop. Please don't! He's finally confessed, ma'am. And we got evidence. Letters from before his marriage. Well, in accordance to our protocols, we have to investigate further. And make sure no other member of the Light is involved. Understood, ma'am. Ma'am, the wife is here. -Ulfah. -Sofia. You have to take care of your health and your baby's. That's what matters most. Mm-hmm. Maybe it's because of the hormones that… -I overreacted. -Yes, yes. I understand completely. Is it possible to revoke the charges? The two of you need to talk first, okay? You stay here, watch over her. What have I done? It's okay, it's okay, it's not your fault. -It's not your fault. -This is wrong, Tara. I should be running away. Why am I doing this shit? No, stop it. Don't do it now. Don't take it off. Where are you keeping the footage? It's there in the bag. My god, it's not safe to stash it all in one bag. Listen. Go sneak into the basement first. Here, take my car keys. Car's at B2. I'll catch up with you. Uh. Uh… And Ulfah? -How about Ulfah? -We'll pick her off at her apartment. The Light doesn't say, who Hafiz is having an affair with. -Tara. -Yes, ma'am? Why don't you give Salina the hair treatment package as well? Wow, lucky her, she's getting the full-service today. I can call in the other girls if you need help. It's a chance for them to learn. I can handle this. They still have class anyway. Okay. Ma'am. Ma'am. Where are you taking those, Ms. Nanik? To class. But aren't we supposed to do skincare today? That box only has face powder in it. You're gonna need these cleansers for the class demo instead. My goodness, I really am getting old. Thank you, dear. Please forgive me, Ulfah. Ulfah. The whole time we were married, I try with all my might to be faithful. I'm sorry, I made the situation worse. Ulfah. Ulfah. I don't have enough strength. But you three still have a chance to get out. Fiz… no one in the world deserves to be treated like this. No one should be locked up in a place like this just because they fell in love. Tar. Ul? I was so angry, I didn't know what else to do. But I have the charges against Hafiz revoked. It's okay. Ul. Please believe me, I'm truly sorry. But we have to leave all this behind. Together as always. I'd rather raise my child alone instead of forcing myself to stay with a husband who's not in love with me. You're not gonna be alone, Ul. You're still gonna have us. But I don't want you to give up your perfect married life with Aditya, just because we want to leave. She's right, Tara, you don't need to worry. Just drop us off somewhere in the city. I'm going with you. I want out. I say to hell with Aditya, to hell with the Light. God, it's such a waste of time handling the affairs of some jealous brat. It's normal, Ulfah's pregnant. It's just the hormones talking, it's all good. Everything is under control, Al. Okay. Since you've gotta handle on it, let's just focus on my wedding ceremony. The rundown still the same? It is. As for the one who will be officiating, how about Endru? I think he's perfect for it. Mm. Yes, I think so too. Okay. Salina? Are you done with the treatment? Oh. No. Not yet, ma'am. I just went out to use the toilet. -To the apartment, please. -All right. All good, ma'am. What do we have tonight? Are we still having dinner with Salina? Of course, we are. I've already texted her. Ask Miss Nanik to fetch her. We have to stay down, guys. Wait until we reach the highway. Tar, can you please slow down? The road's too bumpy, my tummy hurts. Okay, I'll try to slow down, Ulfa. I'm sorry, girls, I can't bear it anymore. It hurts too much. The exercises for breathing. You still remember them, right? What happened? -Are you okay, Ulfa? -I think I peed myself. I peed. I'm all wet. I'm so sorry, grandma! Are you hurt anywhere? -No, I'm good. -We're so sorry, grandma! Ulfah's peed her pants. She did? I'm all wet. Remember what they said in class about the water breaking before going into labor? It seems we meet again, dear. I think about seven months, right? She's seven months pregnant. Oh. Do you girls know there's a belief saying a baby born during the seventh month of pregnancy brings with it a revelation? What is she talking about? Listen, she's about to give birth. We must help her. Come on. -Follow me. -I can't hold it in anymore! Ul? Ulfah? Just breathe. Keep breathing. You can do it. -Breathe. -Now, push again, child. Push. -Yes, Miss Nanik? -Salina is not in her room. I've tried looking for her everywhere but I can't find her. Miss Nanik, check with the security now. -I said now. -Yes, sir. Has anyone seen Salina? She might be in the restroom, ma'am. Push, Ul. You can do it. -You can do it! -I'm pushing, Na! -You don't know how much this hurts! -Okay. -I'm sorry, Ul. -There, there. Come on. Right, we're almost there. One last push. All right, that's it. You take a look. You have a beautiful baby girl. Now cut the umbilical cord. You did it, Ul. There you go, dear. Careful. You must take this baby to the hospital. You did it, Ul. Welcome to the world, baby. Baby Padma. Her name is Padma. Damn that spoiled brat! She escaped during her treatment! I can't do this anymore. How the hell could we let ourselves be fooled by these brats? Where the hell was our surveillance team when this was all going on? Those goddamn fucking brats! Look at that. Every one of them, they're all a bunch of idiots. What the… I'm comfortable enough. Thank you, Tar. Take a picture of Padma and send it to Hafiz. What should I write? Anything to cheer him up. THIS IS BABY PADMA, SHE WAS BORN EARLY, STRONG, HEALTHY, AND WE'RE OKAY. Look. Have you seen this already? We've tracked their GPS and it seemed they've stopped. They're not too far away from here. Shall I ask security to search for their location? Security, you should've done that ages ago, Ms. Nanik! Yes, sir. Take Hafiz up from his mini mart. He has to be sacrificed. Made an example of him. Coordinate with the security team at the apartments. This is just like that incident two years ago! Two years ago, I would have gotten rid of those punks easily. But you can't do that to these girls. Ulfah is carrying a baby. And Tara is the wife of Aditya. What will happen to our relationship with Mr. Frans? -And tomorrow's your wedding day! -I am not going to marry a spoiled traitor, so don't you dare force me! Fiz, thank you for coming into my life and reminding me about what's most important. I will forever cherish the moments we spent together. But now, we need you to apply your magic touch in editing. Okay, I've already sent the files and uploaded the first video. Testing, testing. I'm Salina, in a few days, I'll be turning 17. This is my room at the Light. I've made a mistake joining them. It was the biggest mistake I've ever made in my life. -Stay tuned. I got more stories for you. -That bitch! Sof, the authorities could track our funds and assets with this. Of course, all this is just for show. I can tinker with the system how ever I want to. I think you'd better call our lawyer now, Sof. You know. I never did approve of the making of that narcissistic documentary of yours. -All right. -Yeah? Did you check upstairs? I have no regrets about anything. At least I've experienced what it's like to fall in love. It taught me to be fearless. I've also understood heartbreak and it developed my intuition. Padma. It's okay. What did the grandma say earlier? Something about a message? Oh. Uh… She said that in ancient times people believe that babies born at seven months bring along a message with them, like a revelation. It's a message for her mom and aunties to stick together and love each other no matter what happens. How do you feel right now, Ul? Giving birth must have hurt like crazy. Yeah, it hurts everywhere. But I feel like I've gained a superpower. Tara and I can totally relate when Ulfah's mentioned her superpower. As girls, we were trained not to be proud of our strength and to be brave. But now, the three of us, through the trials that we've all faced, have realized that a superpower has always been inside us. Since forever. And together we will even find ♪
