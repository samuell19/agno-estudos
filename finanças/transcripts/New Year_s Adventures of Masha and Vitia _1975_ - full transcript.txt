A musical fairy tale for children and adults "New Year's adventures of Masha and Vitia", which was invented by Pavel Finn and directed by Igor Usov With the participation of Gennady Kazansky With music and songs by composer Gennady Gladkov On the verses of the poet Vladimir Lugovoy. My dad denies fairy tales and all kinds of miracles. And my dad, by the way, has a Ph.D. in engineering. And he and I are currently working on an invention. Wait a minute with your invention, "professor". Are you all bespectacled and devoid of imagination? There are no miracles in the world today! For those who don't believe! No Koschei, even children know this! But fairy tales live here and there! Lukomorye is not on the map There's no way to fairy tales! It's the intro, not the fairy tale. And the fable lies ahead! There's a hut on chicken legs in a fable! Believing that is bunk! There, a frog turns into a princess! Which in our age makes no sense! Lukomorye is not on the map There's no way to fairy tales! It's the intro, not the fairy tale. And the fable lies ahead! All our questions will be answered by science The Snow Maiden's not just a dream Distant stars will be visited by rockets But there's a flying carpet too! Lukomorye is not on the map There's no way to fairy tales! It's the intro, not the fairy tale. And the fable lies ahead! Eenie, meenie, minie, moe. Hello, Grandfather Frost! Come on. Please. Meet the real one, the magical Grandfather Frost. - Grandfather Frost. - Pleased to meet you, Vitia. What theatre are you from? Can I hit him? Masha claims - that you are a really magical Grandfather Frost. - Of course. In that case, you are supposed to have a real magic Snow Maiden. Where is she? She was stolen by Koschei the Immortal. I wanted to arrange a New Year for my evil spirits. He knows that the Snow Maiden comes only to good people. So he hid her in his dungeon. Look! In his kingdom, Koschei destroys everything that is bright and alive. He is cruel and greedy. And he doesn't like children at all. He found out that there'll be no New Year Eve without me. He stole me, and in his basement I've been locked up by Koschei! What now should I be? I'm too kind, it it true, and too trusting And now for this, a cruel punishment awaits me! But much worse for me, What about my girls and boys Without me, never, never, will New Year's Eve ever come! New Year's Eve. What shall we do, Grandfather? The Snow Maiden needs help. And we can't live without New Year's Eve. Of course not. How can we live without New Year's Eve? Only to sneak into Koschei's kingdom is no easy thing to do. And there's no way for me to get there. I'll sneak in and help the Snow Maiden. But won't it scare you if I let you into the Fairy Tale? Everything happens there. Excuse me, but could you please send me into the Fairy Tale too? Why, Baba Yaga will look at you like that and you'll lose your glasses with fear. You know, my mother says that girls always need to be protected. And although I understand perfectly well that there is no Baba Yaga, and it's only unscientific imagination, but still... Well, alright, I agree. You two go into the Fairy Tale together. There you will see what is and what is not. A difficult road awaits you, There is no secret in this. To help you a little, I'll give you three pieces of advice. Don't expect help in a fairy tale. You're on your own Try to help everyone who is waiting for your help! A long path awaits you, And besides, I will not hide It's not easy at times to recognize evil under a good mask! When the going gets tough, You must never get lost, And stronger for each other, you, friends, must hold on! And stronger for each other, you, friends, must hold on! - How beautiful! - Nothing special. Yes, it's special. - You think so! - Let's go! Since we're in a magic forest, then you must do as I say. Stop imagining things. Oh, round cracknels and sweets, Tattle, tittle-tattle! We are forest "Gems", "Wild Guitars"! We scream, we strum and we drum! And if we find someone in the forest, We won’t joke with them. We’ll tear them apart! We'll tear them apart! - Can't you play the right chord? - What? - I played one and a half octaves higher! - Yes, he's got a rooster! Koschei to you for such behaviour. Know what he'll do? - What? - Give me that. That's what. Oh, what a miserable life. Everybody scolds me. Shamed by my own collective, in my very own cave. - I play the way I can. - I'll give it to you... - Come on. - Okay. Though an evil spirit, he has feelings of his own. Okay. The alarm! Someone got into our forest! The alarm went off. Who could have snuck in, huh? Let's see. Eenie... meenie... minie Moe! Make the wall transparent. Nobody. We will find the Snow Maiden in the Thirtieth Kingdom So that New Year comes around into every household! Let the road be difficult We know without a clue That good is stronger than evil In reality and fairy tales! What about our New Year? Uncle Koschei promised to arrange it only for us. They're going for the Snow Maiden. Well, that's the end of our New Year. - Grandfather Frost sent them. - Yes, as for Koschei, - we'll get a walloping. - What shall we do? How can we stop them? Fry them! No, we need them... No, we need them... To overcome them... they must be separated. Separated and gobbled up! That's it. I'm off to my place, I'll lure them into my hut and fry them. - We'll have dinner together! - But what about rehearsal? After dinner. And now everyone into an ambush. Hurry! We will overcome the enemy, Whether on horseback or on foot. Get out of the way, Yaga! Get out of the way, Goblin! Let the road be difficult We know without a clue That good is stronger than evil In reality and in fairy tales! I like birds and fish The merry trill of a brook. And I can't live without a smile Watching the flight of the moth! Dinner and overnight stay are waiting here for you, I'll fire up the oven. Cause boys and girls I very much love! Over the roof of an old hut Blue smoke billows around. To me, like living toys, Animals come in droves. Dinner and overnight stay are waiting here for you, I'll fire up the oven. Cause boys and girls I very much love! I've been friends with Snow White since childhood. Everyone knows my kindness. Hurry to me, traveler, no slacking, I can smell your spirit from afar! Dinner and overnight stay are waiting here for you, I'll fire up the oven. Cause boys and girls I very much love! Cause boys and girls I very, very, very, very very much love! Vitia, Vitia. Look, a fairy tale hut! It cannot be! Dead End of Unclean Forces. Thirteen. Hut, turn your back to the forest, and your front to me. Oh please! Something got stuck. - Do you have any oil? - What, darling, it can't be? There, take that! - Well then? - It's all in order. Now come on, turn around. What a beauty! The mechanism is in a terrible state. It's not been lubricated for a hundred years. One hundred and fifty, dear! That's when brother Ivanushka and sister Alyonushka last came. Not since then. Prithee. Eat... Drink, dear guests. And are you going far? Which countries, overseas lands? For business, merchant trade? Or who are you going to fight? You see, the original goal of our expedition is... to penetrate the so-called... - Koschei's kingdom. - Oh, my dears! Koschei will destroy you. Eat your innards, drink your blood. He'll scatter your white bones to the wind. In my opinion, you are exaggerating rather, - the possibilities of this Koschei. - I? Do you know Koschei's strength? Who ruined Tsar Ivan? Koschei! Finist the Clear Falcon, who killed him? Again Koschei the Immortal! My dears, .. And do not dream of going against him. Thank you so much. Everything was delicious. What a lot of sitting around, talking. Well, kiddies, get up on the stove. There you go, Masha. Come on. There you go, Vitia. The morning is wiser than the evening. Cooking dinner is no piece of cake: From swamp mud... pancakes. For the first course, frog soup. Datura henbane salad! Datura henbane salad! - Masha, are you asleep? - No and you? Me neither. Masha, in my opinion, this is Baba Yaga. Really, Vitia? This is your scientific imagination. - Masha? - What? In my opinion, she wants to eat us. Burn, firewood, burn Shuruy, poker, ash! Roast from Masha and Vitia Today I will serve to the table! Today I will serve to the table! Today I will! Boil, water, buzz, hearth! Boil, water, buzz, hearth! No wonder I can't sleep! Cause, boys and girls Cause boys and girls I very, very, very much love! Vitenka, she's already gnashing her teeth. - Vitenka, dear, I'm afraid. - Don't be afraid, Masha. Should I take a walk to build up an appetite? Gone. I don't want to be dinner. Calm down! My dad has a Ph.D. in engineering And I won't let the illiterate old woman eat you. Locked. Quiet. - What on earth is that? - Ah, it's a mortar. What kind of mortar? It's the first I've heard of it. It's the mortar that Baba Yaga flies in. Flies in? Do you know how it starts up? I don't know, there's nothing written about it in fairy tales. We'll see! I wonder what reward I'll get from Koschei for my service? Do you know the magic word, otherwise it won't start. Wait a moment. Oh, you fairy-tale magicians, I knew it. Your technology is on the verge of science fiction. - An ordinary JPE. - What is a JPE? Jet powder engine. Get in. Get ready. Ignition key. Ignition. Get ready. Countdown! Five, four, three, two... One... go! Hooray!!! You know, Vitia, I won't call you professor anymore, OK? Well, you can if you want. Then I won't call you four-eyes, alright? Four-eyes isn't necessary. Thanks. I have baked such tasty pies For friends, not for enemies And there's not a soul around in this forest Open the door, dear traveler, Please do try my tasty pie And you'll get a thank you from the Oven. How can we deal with this misfortune, Vitia, please advise me! It's dangerous to approach her, You know that very well! Both the thicket and the clearing are full of such deceit! We must help along the journey All those waiting for help! Masha, help. Baba Yaga walled me up. Open the oven door. Set me free. - Masha, be careful! - Vitia, help. Give me a handkerchief, please. Oh, thank you, kids. Help yourself! My cakes are delicious. - Take it, Vitia. - Thank you very much, Oven. But my mother categorically does not allow me to eat in the street. Here, Mashenka, is a hot coal for you. Wherever it rolls, that's where you should go. It will show you the way to the kingdom of Koschei. Goodbye. Forest Goblin lived so freely had fun every day To neither rider nor pedestrian would he give way. But I got to the city by pure chance. What a mess Since then, I always hated boring dense wilderness. Trust Forest Goblin! Hey, hey, hey, it's not a lie! But to live as before, But to live as before I can't, I can't, I can't and wouldn't try! - Hello! - Hi! What's up? Did you pick up our coal? Which coal? - The red one. - A little red one. No, I didn't. - What have you done? - Shame on you? What do they teach you in the forest? That world is education, in winter and in spring I repeat, without exception, To all the evil spirits of the forest. It's a shame to live dishevelled, Annoying to drink from puddles, When all power's in the atom And in chemistry, too! Trust Forest Goblin! Hey, hey, hey, it's not a lie! But to live as before, But to live as before I can't, I can't, I can't, and wouldn't try! You are brought up by your parents. You eat apricots. But I don't know my mum. They say she's a witch, but who, what witch, where did she go? And everyone pokes fun at you. Everyone shames you. Each of you requires villainy. And I might have a soul, as delicate as a flower. Uncle Leshy, we didn't mean to offend you. Don't leave, please. For your kindness, I can point the way to the kingdom of Koschei. Honestly? Who do you take me for? Just drop that lad, let's go. No, I won't go anywhere without Vitia. Let me go! What are you doing with a girl. Leave her! And I, man to man, will show you the way to Koschei. Do you agree? Thank you, agreed. Deal? Deal! Stop shaking. Forgive me boy, I won't do it again. Let me go. I won't. Who sent you? - Baba Yaga. - Purpose? - To separate you. - Tell me the road to Koschei. I don't know. They won't let me in there. Let me go, boy. - So be it. - Thank you, boy. - You're welcome. - Thanks. Goodbye. - Goodbye. What's with him? Just a small electric charge, why did he shake so much? Have pity on me, Masha! My kids have all grown up. Branches bend down to the ground. No one to take care of me. You are tired on the way. Why not come up here to me Come and taste my apples How can we deal with this misfortune, Vitia, please advise me! It's dangerous to approach her, You know very well! Both the thicket and the clearing are full of deceit here! We must help along the journey All who need assistance - Take it. - No, besides, it's not washed. It's not convenient. Eat it, it's not convenient. Thank you, Masha and Vitia. Take another apple. Throw it on the ground and follow where it rolls. It will show you the way to Koschei. - Thank you, Yablonka! - Thank you, bye! - Goodbye! - Goodbye, Masha and Vitia! We will find the Snow Maiden In the land behind nine mountains So that New Year comes around into every household! Let the road be difficult We know without a clue That good is stronger than evil In reality and in fairy tales! What are you doing?! That's it, kids. That's it, little chicks. Come down. Here. Sit down! The end's at hand, I'm wild cat Matt. My first move will be my last. I'm tomcat Matt, my scheme is known, I hate to pull a cat by its tail bone Nightmare's touch is in my eyes. Just one quick jump, one blow to skies I do not need a second try. I hate to pull a tail by cat awry Hell, no, of course it's the other way around. I hit just once, I'm fast and brave I ate a dog in these affairs. I'm tomcat Matt, my scheme is known, I hate to pull a cat by its (me-me-me-meow) tail bone - Wild cat Matvey. - Masha. - Vitia. - Wild cat. I'm keeping it simple, you guys. I don't have any of that stuff. No tricks, I immediately invite them to gobble you up. And I will. He will. You, mushrooms, say goodbye to each other. Kiss, cry. You want to cry, cry. I love it when someone cries. What shall we do? And I also love to be told tales. Come on girl, start a fairy tale. Come here. - Get started. - The tale of the turnip. - Of what? - The turnip! That's fine. I can allow it. Go ahead. Grandfather planted a turnip. The turnip grew... big, oh so big. Grandfather pulled and pulled at the turnip, but he couldn't pull it up. I understand, he was a weakling, your grandfather. Grandfather called grandmother. They pulled and pulled, but they couldn't pull it up. What a bunch of weaklings. Well? Grandmother called Juchka. Who is this? Juchka is a small dog. Woof woof. No need for Juchka. Skip that bit. She called Ju... Woof-woof, well, we'll skip that, she called a cat. This is a completely different matter. I approve. Go on. They pulled and pulled, but they couldn't pull it up. I can't believe this, forgive me, but I just don't believe it. Masha, it's done! The cat called a mouse. Off you go, Masha, let's run! This forest man, silly clot, He is caught on a knot. And I can't unhook myself. I've been hanging here all night. I ask you to put me right To get down from the tree to the path How can we deal with this misfortune, Vitia, please advise me! It's dangerous to approach him, You know that very well! Both the thicket and the clearing are full of such deceit We must help along the journey All those waiting for help! How can we help? I have an idea. Oh thanks, kids. Oh, Masha and Vitia, thank you. That's how Baba Yaga hung me from the limb. Now, come down! - And you, pioneers, I suppose? - Not yet, but we aspire to be. Strive correctly. And for helping me out... take this ball of wool and wherever it rolls, boldly follow it and go. It will lead you to the stone pillar, to Koschei's road. And follow it northwards. Now, follow the ball. Goodbye, Vitia and Masha! To Koschei's kingdom I will deceive you, deceive you! Look, Vitia, this is where we have to go! Come on. - Let's go! - Wait, Masha, something is wrong here. Let's see. Right. It's clear. It's Baba Yaga's footprint. What a meanie! Lesovichok said to go north. Let's check it out. You're lying, Yaga, you can't fool me! That's the north! What should I do, How should I be? I'm too trusting and kind And now for this, a cruel punishment awaits me But much worse for me, What about my girls and boys Without me, never, never will New Year Eve ever come! New Year's Eve. - Here we go! - And nothing special's happened to us. We're not afraid of you, Koschei! No way! We'll see about that. Let go of Masha, immediately, Koschei! You will never see your Masha again! Why is your age so short Dear biologist? Dear professor of sour cabbage soup? People have fought for three full centuries Over the secret of longevity And it was discovered long ago by Koschei! I'm cunning, angry and greedy Rude, cruel and merciless, I use my sword in cold blood. Doubts are quite unfamiliar, to me. He has surrendered his heart. And he doesn't regret a thing. In the morning I pine... for gold Daytime I wander the halls. My life is a little dull! I am immortal, that is, eternal, Because heartless Or maybe the other way around? So the main thing is keeping calm. Like this! - Are you afraid of me? - You? Not at all. And don't you shudder? Not a bit. Why should I be afraid of you? I know all about you! Death is at the end of the needle. The needle in an egg, the egg in a duck. Alright, alright! Chatterbox! I'll get you now! What's the matter with you? I've got toothache. It's his own fault he neglects his teeth. Bandage him up. I've tried all, magic and sorcery. Ten healers, all executed. Nothing helps. What will you give me if I cure you? I'll give anything, just help. Release the Snow Maiden immediately. Come here! Oh, what a girl. What is it with you? Tell me your remedy first. Sneaky. First free the Snow Maiden. - No, you tell me. - No, you set her free first. - No, you first. - No, you first. Oh, Mummy. I remove the sorcery spells from the Snow Maiden. I free her. Raise the gate! Bring me a spoonful of salt and a glass of water. Rinse. It's fine! Doesn't hurt a bit. I don't melt in the bright sun. Why, I don't know myself. I don’t walk, but feel like I’m flying. I feel so free and easy. I escaped Koschei's captivity. What a wonderful freedom! And now the New Year will surely come to us after the Old Year. I am grateful to Masha and Vitia. I don't walk, but feel like I'm flying. Sing, little birdies, daisies, bloom, Happy New Year. I escaped Koschei's captivity. How wonderful is freedom! And now the New Year will surely come to us after the Old Year. You sit, old devil. You talk with the girl - and you don't know what trouble you're in! - Yeah, you're getting a lot of chemistry. The fighter stands at the gate. He wants to take your head off. Feed the ravens for dinner. - Who is it? - A boy. My armour, my treasured sword. My spear. That's our man! - You're the daddy of them all! - Uncle Koschei! Clap the girl in irons! I'll be back, I'll execute her at once. She let the Snow Maiden escape. Vira! Let's see how you stand up against my magnet, Koschei the Immortal! There's nothing to say, they've found a fighter! I'll put him on my palm and swat him with the other. Only a wet patch will remain! Listen, Koschei. You probably don't know but my dad has a Ph.D. in engineering. And since childhood I have been very interested in science and technology. Huh? Is that a frog in the swamp croaking? Okay, let's be honest, Koschei. There's no salvation for you. No, it's not a frog, it's a little mosquito buzzing in the forest. Give me Masha, or you'll have a very bad time of it. Is that so? Watch out! I'll kill you! Put your magic slingshot away, where are you pulling me? Give up. I give up! Let Masha go immediately. Okay, I'll let go of your Masha. Only let me go too. Vitia! It's me! - What is it with him? - I defeated him, run. Escaped! What a damned life! Dear! - Dad! - Uncle Koschei! One... Two... Three! Alive. Don't hurt yourself. - Where are they? - They escaped, dad. Sword! Catch them up, grab them and gobble them up! Thank you, Vitia, you are a real friend. Come on. It's what every boy would have done. No, not everyone! Only the bold and comprehensively educated. - Here they are! - Baba Yaga! They're chasing, run, Masha! You're not free to fly at liberty Grey-winged dove! There's no escape in the field From evil spirits! Beware, beware, we're not joking! Under the ground we'll find you Under the ground we'll find you Even underwater, We'll tear you apart! Be there road that you are walking, Or even riding horses Nothing now will save you From the deadly chasing Beware, beware, we're not joking! Under the ground we'll find you Under the ground we'll find you Even underwater, We'll tear you apart! Masha, faster!

Run here. Hide behind me. To the stove, Vitia! Well, Baba Yaga, come! It's for you! Well, Cat Matvey, come closer! Here, come on! Got you. And who's next? Ah, Goblin! Come closer! Here! Got him. I'll teach you to attack Vitenka and Mashenka. Got it? Hooray, victory!!! - Thank you, Masha. - What's that, I did nothing. No, not at all. Everyone helped you because you're so kind and good.
