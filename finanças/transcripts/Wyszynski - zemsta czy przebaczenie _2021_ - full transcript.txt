Puszcza Kampinoska, a large forest around ten miles from Warsaw. It saw fierce fights of Warsaw Uprising. Local partisans, Grupa Kampinos, were a Home Army 3000-strong unit. Lieutenant Wyszyński, one of 3 chaplains in the unit, a Catholic priest with "Radwan III" alias. Wyszyński also served as a chaplain of the insurgents' hospital in Laski, set up and run by a nun - Mother Czacka. BASED ON A TRUE STORY I found him in the woods. What's the matter with him? His leg! He lost a lot of blood. Why is there a war waged in the very heart of nature? Why does nature stand against itself? The earth struggles against the sea. Could some vindictive force exist in nature? Is death the only way out? How to forgive the enemy? Someone who is hurting you? Do you have to go to war to find forgiveness? Warring with yourself? I guess we'll need to go to town, won't we? Thank you Kasia. I'll get the wet washing. I'll finish the dry clothes. - Hello lads. - Hi Kasia. I've brought you some milk. Okay, leave it down here. Ensign Brzoza. - Gather the platoon. - Yes sir. Platoon, form up in two ranks. Attention! - Thank you, stand at ease. - At ease! Boys, a difficult task is awaiting us today. We have to set up outposts on the outskirts of Laski. Recon and pickets in the direction of Truskaw, Izabelin, Wólka. The recon will be led by Cadet Brzoza. Any volunteers? Volunteers step forward. You will choose five volunteers. Find out where the Hungarians and the Germans are positioned. After returning, report immediately. You're setting off in an hour. Password for tonight: Wisła Response: Wola Don't try your luck in any adventures, no shootouts. You have to come back alive. - Understood? - Yes sir. Fine. One more thing. Our unit has been recently joined by chaplain-lieutenant Stefan Wyszyński, alias Radwan the Third. You are to treat him as one of yours. Some of you already know him. Thank you, Commander. Gentlemen, without further ado. It is an honor for me to serve the Motherland in your ranks. It's worth fighting for. I am commending you in prayer, I am at your disposal. May the Good Lord lead us to battle. God bless you, Chaplain. So far I have focused on the sick and the blind. New duties of the unit chaplain raise many questions in me. How am I supposed to be a soldier? A priest in a uniform, the uniform which for understandable reasons I cannot wear. Will I have to fight hand-to-hand as my forebears did in the January Uprising? I've been asked several times how you can atone for killing an enemy. What if I were to kill someone? Yet, I'm a soldier now, I'm supposed to fight, but fight in defence. Fight with a rosary or a fist? After all, faith commands me to love my neighbour, but how can I do it in wartime? Who is really the military chaplain? I forgive your sins in the name of the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit. Lieutenant, I request being placed on the first line. - Do you have a weapon? - Yes, a Vis handgun. Fine, you will join Cadet Brzoza. - You open fire on command. - Yes sir. Remember to keep spacing. Go ahead! Fire! Grenade, now! Down! It has begun. Our forces struck in Warsaw. May they have enough strength. There will be injured. We shall be prepared for it, Reverend Professor. Medic! How about the surgical instruments? There are three full sets. It may not be enough, we need more. - But there's nowhere to get it from. - Are you sure? Haven't we got a carpentry shop? There are chisels and saws. It's me, mother. Gather everything and show it to Dr. Cebertowicz, he will choose. Of course, Mother. The Germans are putting up greater resistance in Warsaw than we thought. They're getting reinforcements. Our assault against the airport got stuck. Reverend Father, do you think that the uprising still stands a chance? The Command thinks so. What seemed certain yesterday, is not so certain today. Almost a hundred injured people came from the airport. - Not enough beds. - I'll be there in no time. Reverend Father? They talk of mass shootings, executions, and that the Germans treat our captives like bandits. I know. I know, Mother. I know and I ask myself how we should deal with them. In the same way? An eye for an eye? I think, Reverend Father that we should do our job. The rest belongs to Providence. Providence. Make way! I'll help you. Hold. Father, father, I would like to confess. The third of August, it's today. Our Radwan's birthday. Which one is he celebrating today? The forty-third one, if I'm not mistaken. I hope our professor won't discover that we're preparing a surprise for him. Here comes the professor. Ready? Plurimos annos plurimos. Plurimos annos plurimos. Annos, annos plurimos. Oh, gosh. I've been tricked. I am grateful to you for remembering, but it's not the right time to celebrate a birthday, while uprising goes on. That's right, but even in these difficult times let's find a little joy. We've baked a cake. We wish you God's blessings, and your fill of health and all kinds of prosperity, so that you could lead all of us, towards holiness at his time of pain and anguish. Stay with us forever. Dear Mother, I hope, that one day God will want us to meet as saints in heaven. I pray every day for the Good Lord to give us all strength, strength to carry this cross. Let us carry these treats to the sick and injured. - And the flowers? - The flowers will go to the chapel. I will celebrate today's Mass for all people fighting for freedom. One more time, thank you for everything. It's from one of the soldiers. May it serve you well during the wartime wandering. Ave Crux, spes unica. - Amen. - Amen. I've already seen many crosses, but never one like this. Made from bullets and shells. Did the bullets from these shells kill or hurt anyone? What does it mean: "Love our enemies", now that we have to shoot at them? Love for the Motherland requires sacrifice. So much needed nowadays. Fighting bravely to liberate the capital, you testify that freedom is what you desire. And as a Polish nation, we have full right to it. And even if we were to trust against all odds, we cannot give up because even when all have perished, the cause will still remain, as will this very right to freedom. May it inspire you in the moments of peril. Just thinking about it alone is our greatest victory. Ecce Agnus Dei, ecce qui tollit peccata mundi. Beati qui ad cenam Agni vocati sunt. This is Miss Zosia. Please. I collected it myself. Hmm, well... An order came from Warsaw. Major Okoń will take over the command in place of the wounded Captain Szymon. - This news was on the radio. - And commander Dolina? He should be the one. It's an order from the headquarters; orders shouldn't be questioned. Unit! Follow me, march on! You remind me of Father Skorupka, who died in 1920, defending Warsaw. It was the Miracle on the Vistula. And I remember we learnt about it at the seminary. I was 19 then. I knew him. He was a great role model for me. How I wish for miracle to happen now and for us all to come back alive. - Things are good? - Yes, Ensign. There's not a soul around. So, keep it up like this. Here's the beau. After an evening bath, smelling all so nice, at last. Now you can expect Zośka to come up to him. Just look, what smartass boys. And how are things with your unit paramedics? Oh, it's not worth talking to these ladies' men. Better listen what the village mayor of Granica told me. Two Great War veterans get to meet. Elderly gentlemen, and they talk about having sclerosis and memory problems. One says to the other: "I don't know it anymore, whether I served in the second division of the first army or in the first division of the second army?", and the other replies to him: "I don't personally remember if I was hit with a ball between the shoulder blades, or with a shovel between the balls". You heard that? What conditions will the young generation get to live under after the war? Us, Germans, others... They're washing the cobblestones of this city with their blood. Is that how one should love? How will the wounded become fathers of families, what kind of father am I to be for them? How can one explain, the difference between: "Thou shall not kill; love and forgive"? You feel like joking now. We need to send out patrols tomorrow. Sometimes you have to do that otherwise you could go crazy. Zosia will be joining your patrol at sunrise. With the boys, bring her as close to the hospital as possible. Okay Beautiful night. True. So hard to believe there is a war out there. Do you miss your family? Yes, they stayed on the estate while I went to war. Did you help on the farm? Yes, I did. I mean, before I left for Warsaw to study there. I did all sorts of things, as a stable hand, when harvesting. And now the sisters help them. What did you do before the war? This and that. I earned extra cash at the municipal printing house. And then I trained to become a typesetter. And the family? My father left me with my mother in 1932, and then I heard he'd fought in Spain during the Civil War, and then we never heard of him again. This is why "Radwan", our chaplain is like a Father to me here. It's bedtime. We have a long journey tomorrow. Yes. Come on boys! The last song and we go to sleep. The night is coming. The sun's already left the mountains parted with fields, slid off the seas. Rest now, in a quiet sleep. God is so close. Will all the things I want to tell them, be heard, oh God? Does everyone want to listen to your voice from my mouth? We've gone past Pociecha, we are here now. This is Laski; we're heading towards Wólka. The objective of our recon, we have to come to this forest crossroads. The Germans are already all over this area. We could meet the Hungarians, but we get on with them well. There is some damage in Izabelin, but fortunately our hospital is safe. Staś, you're going in the vanguard. Tomek, you'll cover him. We'll walk with Zosia, who is carrying reports further, some distance. - All clear? - Yes sir. Your eyes in the back of your head! What are you praying for? For our and Brzoza's health. And you are not praying? I don't have the time for such lofty stuff. - I have other worries. - Knock off those excuses. The best cure for worries is a prayer. - God will listen to everyone. - Perhaps, to a German as well. They wear it on the belts "Gott mit uns". We're left to our own devices. But a moment of prayer probably won't hurt you. You should talk with our chaplain. You feel like converting me? And maybe Radwan will hear my confessions. May this goddamn war come to an end - and quickly. I didn't think I'd miss the university. What did you study? Architecture After the war, I will be an engineer. So maybe you will rebuild my house in Żoliborz. Not only yours. I want to design an orphanage. It will be useful for kids. We part ways here. A bit further this way; you'll see a hospital. - May God be with you. - Good luck. - And the tenth one? - "or anything of thy neighbour". Good. Mikołaj do you know that this plane doesn't have one engine? I know. Then run to the carpentry shop and tell the carpenter, that mother Czacka asks him to make an engine. - OK. - Go on. - Are you here Reverend Father? - Yes, I am. Why are you so quiet Father? A patrol set off yesterday. They haven't come back yet. - You are worried about them? - Well, yes, a little bit. There's no point. It's a matter of Providence. I feel like a father waiting for kids back from school. You want to scold them? No, no. I want to complete a certain conversation. Especially with Jaś. - Which one is that? - The one with the moustache. With the moustache, hm... I'm sorry. Let me know when they're back. I'll be at the hospital. I'll do it. What's up? Germans, two SS-men and a vehicle. - Far away? - See it for yourself. How about taking them by surprise. No way. Lieutenant Zetes's orders were clear. No gunfire. We have our tasks. The time will come for those bastards. But why wait when there's a chance? We'll get the vehicle. Yes, we will. Staś, you're going with me. Tomek, you cover us from the right. And silently... Fire! Cover me. Jasiek! Stasiek, help! Help! Man down! Doctor! Man down! - Where was he hit? - In the stomach. We ran into Germans. We managed to escape, Janek covered us. He still had time for a grenade. To the operating room. On the double! Let's go! Holy Mary, mother of God pray for us sinners, now and in the hour of our death. Amen. Go and bring Father Radwan here. I don't want to be alone. Man, if I don't start right away you'll bleed to death. Radwan, Radwan! Morphine! - Inject morphine. - Radwan! I'm here. It's alright, it's okay, Jasiu. Syringe! It's all right. Today is the day of blood and glory. Rise Poland... This is the end. No! For him, it is just the beginning. Will I have sacrificed enough? It is others who perish, after all. - Excuse me, Chaplain. - Yes? Can you speak German? There is a request for a confession. - A German? - Yes, there was a skirmish in the woods. We gathered our wounded, so we took him as well. Is it true you want to confess? Yes, please. I've committed a lot of evil. What have you done? God is listening to you. I took advantage of a girl. A young Polish girl. Did you rape her? No, I lied to her. I promised I would marry her. But I already have a wife. Do you wish to tell God anything else? No That's all. Have you killed people? Of course, just like everyone else. Do you regret it? What should I regret? We are saving the world from the Bolsheviks and subhumans. They are God's enemies. Jews too? Yes. They are Bolshevik pigs, after all. But Jesus was a Jew. If you are aware of... If you are aware of your words, then I cannot forgive you your sins. Why? Why? Why? How can I possibly love those who are murdering us? Today we bid farewell to one of ours. His Motherland was his soul and freedom his desire. Let his spirit be for all of us a testimony of a soldier's sacrifice, youthful courage. Let him be an example for us and for those who will come after us. May his memory stay with us forever. Attention! Shoulder arms! Present arms! "Sleep well in the dark grave, dream of a free Poland." May the Lord give you a drink from the Water of Life. Dear friends, remember, what I'm about to tell you. Only eagles soar over rocky ridges and do not fear the abyss, gales or storms. You must be like eagles deep inside. An eagle's heart and an eagle's sight set towards the future. Let us remember our brother, with a moment of silence. In honour of his memory! In nomine Patri, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti. Proceed. A salute of honour, Load weapons! Fire a volley! Fire! At ease! Shoulder arms! Right Turn! Follow me, march on! Farewell, Jasiu. Here is the Polish section of the BBC Radio, London. In a moment we'll read a message from Pope Pius XII to the fighting capital. Warsaw. However deep we feel pity at the sight of so much suffering, we feel an even greater admiration, whereby we humbly bow to the bravery of warriors and victims. These victims and warriors showed the world to what heights heroism can rise born and sustained by a noble sense of honour and by strong convictions of the Christian faith. "Roma locuta." It is important that the Holy Father expresses his views. May these words spread out to the streets of Warsaw and uphold the failing spirits of our soldiers. The promised support is not coming. The Soviets are waiting. It is only us and the Germans now. And still God, still God. This has happened before. In Krakowskie Przedmieście St. An overturned figure of Christ lies again. Pointing to the sky with his hand. We only need one thing. Hope. Reverend Professor, do you think Brzoza likes me? Darling, why do you ask me? Go and ask him. He's constantly on duty, and I'm still in this hospital. Have patience, you'll meet soon. We'll get there soon Zosiu. You'll have a word. - Are we there yet? - Soon. Brzoza is already waiting. - Halt! Documents! - Documents. Witczyński? Wyszyński. What's this? Where are you going? Hans. What's wrong with her? Typhoid fever? No, childbirth. We're going to hospital. She is about to give birth. Breathe calmly. - Go now! - Thank you. Breathe, breathe breathe calmly! Hold it! It's all right. Great job! It's good you're here. The Jerries are up to something, the road is full of patrols. What took you so long? The Germans stopped us. If only you'd seen Rev Professor, who didn't even bat an eyelid, when the Jerries held guns to his face. - You got it done? - Yes, the drop was picked. Commander Dolina ordered us to bring a few boxes. They'll take it with the ammo on their way to Żoliborz. Zosia! Serve the cause. What made you so tongue-tied? We're taking the boxes. - Why not take a look at what's inside? - Let's see then. So many bullets! Great. There's something else here. Well... We can fight with a gun like that. Father Chaplain, would you bless a gun? Son, I may bless you but never a weapon. How much does war change us? Can the lie, which I have consciously uttered, be seen as resourcefulness in good faith? The cadet doesn't even know what tricks they teach us in the female CYA. I've already escaped from the Jerries three times. What are you hiding there, Miss? Letters, perhaps? From your fiancé? War is not a time for romance. The cadet will be surprised. I have something much better here. Yes? Let me see. Girl, this is... - Where is that from? - It was my Dad's. He left the gun for my mother in August 1939. And the eagle... It's from his officer's cap. He was interned in the Kozelsk camp. The Germans stated that he was killed by the Soviets in Katyń in spring 1940. The Germans are coming Cadet, three vehicles! Run to the other side. - Quick. - Let's use the piano as a cover! Help me! Make it straight! God bless you. God bless you. Do you want to attend to your wounded? No, thanks, Father. We've been informed that there are bandits in the area. So, what then? Are you hiding anyone here? No. We only have sick civilians and a nun here. They don't bother anyone. We'll check that right now. Search the place! Faster, faster, keep moving! - Beautiful weather, isn't it? - Yes. Let's go inside. You first. Do you know these words from Faust: "Art is eternal, life is short"? - No. - No? Do you give concerts for the dead here? Yes, it helps lift up their spirits. Oh, yes. At least to silence these constant bombings and shootings. I'm about to do carry out a shooting here to give you a better tune. What are you doing here? I'm the chaplain of this place. I also help the blind. They need me. And this, what is that? It's caught my attention immensely. Typhoid fever! It belongs to someone suffering from typhoid. We have a lot of people here with suspicion of typhoid fever. Unfortunately, our conditions are difficult and we are short of medicines. Sorry, but I can't help you. We haven't found anything suspicious. Sick and wounded civilians everywhere Colonel. A beautiful instrument. Take good care of it. I advise you against supporting bandits. And don't forget: "Life is short, and art is eternal." Yes? It's OK it's over now. "Beautiful instrument, take good care of it." And where's the concern for human life? Am I allowed to think that our enemies are devoid of humanity? How much does war change us? I have lied again. I'm getting better at it. Typhoid, feigned childbirth, what comes next? Mother, forgive my fear, my deception. What was it for? If I had stood in truth, would I have saved the lives of these people? Today I'm not sure of anything. Mother! Look after those who perish! Young and old ones. Look after our tormentors, our enemies. And give me strength, to meet the challenges of the war and serving the sick. - Praised be Jesus Christ. - Forever and ever - Amen. - Here are the documents of the wounded. - Thank you, Sister. They're zeroing in. Quick! Take the wounded to the basement! Take cover! Have the Germans forgotten about you? I had a surgery. They didn't see me. Does God see man? Do you want Him to see you? Do you want it? Another September day passed quietly. The life in the insurgents' hospital teaches me to serve the needy. Doctor Cebertowicz does what he can, to help all the wounded. And Mother Czacka? She gets food somehow, to keep us fed. Various detachments drop in, some stay longer at our hospital, others just have the wounds dressed and then go on fighting. The uprising is coming to an end. The ranks are getting thinner. Sometimes our soldiers urgently need medications. Then I try to take whatever I have from the hospital. I push my way through the front line carrying anything to save their lives. Sometimes it works. But not always. Get off! Faster! Keep going! Faster, faster! Women for forced labor! And have those bastards executed immediately! - Step aside! - Leave our wives alone! And what's he doing here? A priest caught in our roundup. Mr. Officer, Mr. Officer, please leave those people alone. They are civilians, they've done nothing wrong. Priest! You are lucky, that I am a believer. You will watch them die. Come on! Up against the wall with them! Against the wall, up against the wall! Faster, faster! Please, don't kill them! Oh God... Oh God... Oh God... Oh God... God... Give me strength, give me strength, give me strength, to love my enemies. Give me strength, to love my enemies. Give me strength, to love my enemies. Because I can't, can you hear me? I can't. I can't do it on my own, God, give me strength, give me strength. This cassock saved me. It's not right. Mother, a piece of cloth saved my life. It's not a priest's role to judge God's Providence. Why did God actually spare me? I too once had to answer the question of why God chose me. I was young, pretty and rich. From a so-called good family. My whole life was ahead of me. Meanwhile, on a ride the horse stumbled and I fell. It didn't seem like a big deal, but when evening came I started seeing these spots in front of my eyes. A few days later the ophthalmologist said that the retinas had come off in both eyes. Back then there was no cure for it. And then I thought, just like you, Father. Why is God doing this? Now I know. It has a purpose. Over the year, when I still could see, I travelled around Europe, I learnt how to help the blind and then, being blind myself, I started to act, building this work. Maybe it's the same with you, Father? Maybe God has prepared for you a great plan? And one should only ask Him, what plan? I can't do it. Reverend Father, you were saved for a reason. And it will have to be accomplished. Poland will now be under the Soviet rule. And they hate Jesus. Really should I dare think that God saved me because he has for me a plan more important than for those who died? We have to trust Him. This is the moment when we should think about the future. However dark it will be. They're evacuating Warsaw. Putting everything to the torch. What's the reason for it? They've already won. To give a warning. So that not a single stone is left upon another. The wind blows the ash from the burning Warsaw. We will need to fight for survival, for the survival of the nation. Father, father! Yes? I want God to see me. What do you want to tell Him? I... I repent. I absolve you, in the name of the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Germany will lose What awaits us for all these crimes. Is there hope for us? There is always hope. But ahead of us there is still something very difficult. What is it? Atonement... Atonement for the countless murdered people. LOVE FOR ENEMIES Thou shalt love thy enemy. Nothing more precious we could receive from dying Warsaw. It's the most sacred message, it's testament, from fighting capitol to us and to the whole world. It's all I could do. He survived. - Thanks to the Reverend Father. - Rather, thanks to God. A half-burnt piece of paper with "THOU SHALT LOVE", found in September 1944 by Wyszynski, has remained in Laski to this day... 20 years after the Second World War, during the Second Vatican Council, a gesture became world famous. It was a message the Polish bishops sent to the German bishops. The most famous passage in it is: "We grant forgiveness and ask your forgiveness". This gesture initiated the idea of reconciliation in Polish-German relations... TO THE PRESENT AND FUTURE PRIESTS
