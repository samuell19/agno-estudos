13 months ago - Here, G-1. - Here the ISO HQ - I 've found it. - Nice work. Where is he ? 34 degrees north, is 140 degrees. No doubt, it is the nuclear aircraft carrier of Galactor. Bird Go ! Bird Run ! What are you ? The new weapons Galactor? What is going on ? Who are you ? Everything is fine ? - Hello. - Thank God ! Serious, you watched it? The sky. What is that thing ? Do not stop there! Hey, are you? This is exactly like last time ... What… - Are you hurt? - Hello. I ask if you're hurt. You do not look like a bad guy. He is a hero of the show? Tekksetter! - Who are you all? - will be discussed later. That's what you look at, am I wrong? - What's that pencil? - Move back! You know then answer! What is that ? Who are you ? - We ... - Heroes, dare I say. Heroes ? The heroes do not exist. Well, send me back to my world. - We can not leave. - What? So that was it. It happened to me the same thing, there is one year. You're kidding ? I have friends - and people to protect! - U.S. too. Help us. You did not give us your name. Kaidô Emi. - Emi is written as "smile". - Me is Ken. Takeshi, delighted. I Jôji. Tetsuya. He created an interdimensional transportation to move from world to world and destroy them. You know his name, Professor? The last letter of the alphabet, worthy of a destroyer of worlds. WITH... - He grabbed Box. - Case? Case can change the balance of possibilities. It is a powerful weapon that grants wishes. Case said that reflects the soul of its owner. In the hands of Z is a scorching sun. I saw it. The sun has sucked my world. - He did more. - What? It became this pencil. You and I were present in lots of worlds similar to ours. - But ... - Dad ... - Whether an accident or illness ... - Emi! - In each of them, you would die young. - But it's ... The death of Emi is a fixed point. No it's impossible ! Yes, this is nonsense ... Your life was about to fade completely. I could not do anything against it. But that's when I got which freely manipulates the possibilities and wish-fulfilling. - You mean ... - Yes. Case. I have made it my wish. "Keeps my daughter die." That's your true desire? Yes. So I used Case to separate dimensions. separate them? Humans must make many choices. In a world, you turned right. In another left. With the power of Case, I created a world of new possibilities. This is where you currently find yourself. You currently live in a world that I chose. A dimension in which Kaidô Emi does not die. - Emi. - So in fact, Kaido destroyed worlds to prevent Emi died. So if we stop it, Emi die? I can only extend my possibilities. If I advance, I know that the world will be there. Why do you do that ? It is here that you will be happy! No, papa. This place is right there for me to live. And just to live, not be happy. I want to choose my path. - Why do you insist? - I would argue of my own free will! Emi! Ken ! Why you ? - What are you doing here ? - It's not just me. Fight, Emi, and save it! Saves his heart! All this is for your own good, Emi. Let's go ! Ray ultra-destructive! Whirlwind Fighter ! Tornade vacuum ! Voltekka! Papa. You see, I am no longer a child. Emi ... You've grown up. You finally look at me. You did that for me. It was a pleasure. Emi ... I love you, Dad. Look! Emi. Wants it. I wish find all the worlds lost! Other worlds seem to have returned too. It's time for us to travel, right? - Guys ! - Do not cry, Emi. Become strong. Even stronger! Non ! It is… It's been a long time. Ken ? - How to ... - We need your power. What do you mean ? I'll explain later, come! The operation failed. Come back, sir! I turn on Nexus. The settings are almost complete. No, stop, it will ... The victory of humanity. Monsieur. Stop, doctor Nambu! Our last hope was to bomb them when they are cryopexy, but it's also damn. There is no other choice. There is necessarily! Do not give up! Your four comrades died thinking like that. The Galactors have no will. They are only intended to exterminate all intelligent life. You know it very well. The survival of humanity is no longer based on this energy. My friends gave their lives fighting for the future of humanity. This is why I refuse to let you do that! Ken… Ken ! Ken… It's not true ! Tatsunoko Legends Gatchaman - Goodbye, my friends It has nothing of a neighborhood youth. To revive the economy, we want to make new Shibuya accessible. It is impossible in the current situation. - Indeed. - I know what you mean. This is the only reason that would drive a high official to meet - a simple science. - Do not be so modest. Nobody sees you as well. You are the hero who saved the world. There are six, Galactors, inorganic beings, arrived. Their goal was to exterminate all intelligent life. No weapons are effective against them, helpless humanity found himself cornered. Until the appearance of the Nexus. We were at the brink of extinction, its power was vital. The problem is management now that the threat has disappeared. The fact that I got it displeases you, right? Non. Parliament gave you the job. There are of course still some protests, but that is not the concern. Foreign countries. Every day they more strongly urge us to give them the details. The only information are useless. It is impossible to move the Nexus. Here's the problem. This is a very great military power that rests there. It is impossible to ask them to close their eyes. Effectively. Furthermore, they begin to understand the characteristics of this power. If it were to be made public ... We must raise energy to prepare for this moment, is not it? It requires a much greater power. Plan your separation from the Ministry of territories raises many fears. The Ministry of Defense is still reluctant to provide personnel. Influenced by the pressure of foreign countries. Public opinion can remedy that. It must be, right? Your ideals have given strength to the country. It should not be in it becomes a burden. Have no fear. Very well. Preparations for the ceremony today forward? Many young people worried about the future of this country will be present. In the first place, I plan to unify the people's will. Please excuse me. In the gravitational field? It's not just the Nexus? Investigate. Sir, someone entered the third security zone. What do you mean ? When the first two zones have they been taken? In fact, they suddenly appeared in the 3rd. - Suddenly? - What is going on ? It's a little too quiet. There's really nobody. Jôji, you found something? Irregularity is at the center of the dome, but it would be ten meters underground. It is supposed to have appeared where Case left Emi, but it is shifted. It is possible that the space-time of the world is distorted. - Emi can approach safe? - I do not have enough info. The dome seems to be government. There are sensors and cameras everywhere. They observe us. Stopped… Sounds good hassle. Let's go back when we have more details ... Two cars arrive from the west. Probably security. - What do we do ? - Let's finish is right next door. Wait, let's see what they do. Do not worry, girl. - Doctor Nambu? - Ken? Impossible… - You know him ? - Yes. It's a little him the creator of my Science Ninja Team. - Get ready. - Well. Listen, doctor Nambu. I'm not Ken you know. I see, so that's it ... You understand a little faster, I think. We're not there for a meeting between old. - I am not old. - Hurry up. It is important to me ... Listen to me! We know that there is an irregularity. Inside. I will dissipate. Monsieur ? An irregularity? Basically a point where some energy is unusually dense. I understand. That's what you call it. - You know what it is ? - I have a question. Why do you want to dispel? irregularities dangerously unbalance worlds. We must not leave them. Ken asks what this dome. - Why ? - Quickly. Okay. Sir, this dome is why? You seem to be my enemies. What? - Bird Go ! - Bird Go ! I'll ask again. You know them ? Stop them all. - They are approaching. - You see, thank you. Behind. Wait, I have questions! The discussion is over. Transformation, Polimar ! Monsieur ! What? Attention ! Bird Go ! What? Spend all N-mode. Unbelievable ... They developed this technology? What takes them? Their armor is powered. Stay alert. Pegas, Tekksetter! Affirmative. Reinforcements… Central AI, awakens in full auto unconscious combatants. Joe! It's really you ? You want so much to kill me, Joe the Condor? Joe ... what are you ... Ken ! - I have a daughter! - Put her in the car. Dark. Emi! Let's go, follow me! But they Emi! This way. Voltekka! Stopped. Its good ! Evidence that the neighborhood kids are with the enemy. It will make things easier. It hurts. That's enough, Joe! Big fight, apparently. All my excuses. I like being a teacher. What is it ? Why did you join Joe in the Science Ninja Team? He knows fighting and he's smart, but it lacks something vital to embody justice. It is indeed possible. That said, he found the information will help us to act. I'm not talking about that! You're a very right, Ken. And that's your thing? Among the Science Ninja Team, I was granted the title of Gatchaman that you, Ken. Gatchaman is the symbol of hope. This is perfect for you. Little Joe saw his parents murdered before his eyes, his hatred feeds his combativeness. This is the dark justice. You, you owe to shine with hope. And for that, you need a shade. Joe is someone you need ... No, you need instead. You're finally wake up? Hello, Grandpa. Even if it does not really shaping up to be a good day. It's okay. It's nothing. You're much Ken I know. Yes. You never returned, I was looking for you. I could never find you. In all dimensions, only one had a gravitational anomaly. This one. Ken was not the only one sent to another world by Kaido. That day, the sun me too absorbed, and I woke up here. I was stunned at first. There was another me in this world. What does it do to fall on another self? Not much. It's like looking in the mirror. Science Ninja Team and I are there too, right? You are not together? Here, the Science Ninja Team was killed. Ken… You too. What happened ? First, tell me something. You know for the Nexus. What's this ? The irregularity? I just know that this is energy dense. Ken and Nambu analyzed his power, but they could not find out what it is. Well, to understand, we must first talk to you about Case. Case ? A miraculous object to manipulate the possibilities. Originally Case existed in this world. But it was stolen by a guy named Kaido. Kaido was fought just about Case. Case had a colossal energy. While she was there, that world was stable. But if it is removed, where it was still not empty, the surrounding energy comes replaced. This world has tried to supplement the energy lost together Case. Result, an incredible amount of energy is created where Case was before. This is an irregularity. What you call the Nexus. According to calculations, it should alternate between concentration and distribution until the energy of the dimension becomes uniform. Instead, energy continues to regroup. I think the concentrated energy is draw, so she never saturates and continues to amass. This endless concentration disturbs gravitational waves, and those who should be returned to their world are stuck here. I see. It makes sense. That is why this world self-destructs. Pardon ? It is… The effects of the Nexus. All that ? Before the appearance of the Nexus, the Galactors invaded this world. - Galactor? Him again ? - I was also surprised, but nothing to do with the Galactor from home. The existence of the same name, but completely different. It happens, in parallel universes. Anyway, the Science Ninja Team has long fought them. But no one has found an effective way to counter them. Then Dr. Nambu had the idea diverting into a weapon concentrated energy. It's amazing that he managed. In theory, he knew it was possible. There was a breakthrough while studying the irregularity? Not just for the Nexus. Energy news Bird Suits from a technology Galactors. The problem is that by using the energy of the Nexus, a fault occurs somewhere in the world in return. So this is ... Irregularity is a concentrated energy of this world. Consume in abundance will create a deficiency. And it does that? We managed to destroy the Galactors, the price of anomalous phenomena and a declining birth rate. There is virtually no births. If it continues like this, the world will disappear! - You did it even knowing that? - Ken and I, we got opposite. More… Ken was ... Nambu killed. Dr. Nambu killed me? Even after the extinction of Galactors, it has not stopped. Today, it is still consuming power of the Nexus. Until now, there was a limit, but they have just developed a similar laptop battery. You can imagine what it will be used. I have to stop it. By killing Nambu. Do not say that. Where you go ? I know where he is today. I'll finish. Joe, attends ! Joe! Stop, Joe! Dr. Nambu took care of us, we owe him a lot! It is no longer the one we knew. I have to do it. - No, I'll stop you. - Sorry ? He taught us justice, to you and me! In the name of this justice in this world, you killed. Commemoration of peace This afternoon will officially place the commemoration of the victims of Galactors. The Peace Gardens just been completed in the 1st Nexus security zone and are usually closed to the public. People pray. They think of those they have lost hope and a better life. Now that everything is quiet, what do they need to think, according to you? Commemorate the lives lost, regret having been powerless ... Sounds nice, but this is not correct. What they need, it's anger, in my opinion. Anger ? The threat no longer exists, but it's only temporary. When a new enemy appear, They know people face him? It's anything you can not predict it will happen. Better anticipate. Therefore, it is necessary to cultivate the fighting. This is stupid. As long as there a threat, people face. Until a real enemy arrives, I will act as false threat. Among the weapons using the Nexus, this one is very powerful, but as soon as it detects vibration of Galactors she fired. However, the first version is a risk of failure. I wrote a report on this concern, but unfortunately due to lack of budget, they have neither taken nor repaired. You are crazy! You said you dissiperais Nexus. I thought about the best I can. The Nexus is an absolute natural. The dispel would be a miracle. If you can perform miracles, trying to stop me. So I can appropriating your power. Wait, come back here! Please now stand. A minute of silence. One year ago, the Galactors, threatening humanity, were annihilated. And yet I could not bring myself to consider this a victory. I still can not it. What is victory? As you know, I ordered the Science Ninja Team. To protect humanity, the five members valiantly faced Galactors, and they lost their lives. Overcoming Galactors we could not bring them back. In losing my precious comrades, nothing would count as a victory for me. Nevertheless, I had to fight. In order not to lose anyone. So that no one else alive the same. Also, for this, I needed strength. Now that the threat is no longer I studied the Nexus and I use it for military weapons what I know many of you are opposed. But suddenly arrived Galactors from space without warning. What is the guarantee that nothing else will threaten us? The fight is not finished. As long as one is alive, we must continue to resist! What we need is strength and a unified will! What brought you here are personal memories. But let me be honest. It is futile to think of missing persons. Pray simply allows us to comfort us. Today, what we need is to look forward! - Bird Go ! - Bird Go ! I have the means to give you strength! Stop ! I beg you, stop! No stop ! Ken ! - Let's finish is right next door. - Wait. A transmitter to protect you. Fear nothing ! It's time to speak out against the threat. Let those who will argue, quick! Fighting in these armor requires no training or technical. As long as you agree to wear them, they will take care of the enemy. There are three Galactors. Divide us into three groups. I feel light! Ken, do not darken recklessly. It is weakened samples out of cryonics. Fans will fare. Are you sure ? But… He mounted his own show. Let's test the advanced wave generator that serves as a brake on Blue Earth. Advanced waves? Normally, the waves away from the point of generation. Advanced waves then return to the point of generation. Prof says we just. When advanced waves collide, it erases any normal wave. When our Blue Earth completes an interdimensional travel, it compensates with advanced energy waves to stop. It even will make to hinder the supply in the Nexus. And how we will go about it? The intruder this morning are back. Use the railgun. No matter if you kill them. In position ! Fire! - Their weapons have changed. - Electric guns. They reach Mach 2 ... But they are very powerful and use training loads. It does not pierce your Polimar Suit. - Except perhaps at close range. - Prof. Stay as far away Tetsuya. - The shock is quite important. - Watch it, fool! I do not know yet how Bird Suits are supplied Nexus. But when they draw in, it creates a gravitational distortion. I'll watch it and recreate computer a model of waves. Basically, you're going to predict the content based on the container. That's it. What pigeon! It's Gatchaman! The Galactors had not killed? This is not true Gatchaman! This is an intruder from another dimension, do not approach! Pull your guns. They are not dangerous at this point! Central AI, goes into full auto the Bird Suits volunteers. Make the target G-1 and G-2. What? My body moves by itself ... Sir, the N-mode no longer works. What? Ken, I sent the advanced waves. Yes, it has hindered the supply. In two minutes, will be cut. It's incomprehensible. Energy Nexus is properly sent. But something makes it disappear on the way. Immediately stop draw energy. Cooperate and there will be no injuries. Let go of me. Do not kill him. - It does not proceed like that. - I do not care. And… A child watches. The heroes are fighting to protect the people. Do not forget justice. You're much our leader ... Abstain to act selfishly, Joe the Condor. Your role was only to capture Nambu. - Who are you ? - My sponsor. I'm linked to the government of a country which shall remain nameless. The United Nations Security Council sent me. Nambu having seized the Nexus, I watched for the right time. I never imagined this outcome. I see, you helped Joe to stop. I thought it would be most effective. And I was right. Dr. Nambu at the meeting this morning, you lost your title assigned delegate. You are under trial. That explains the absence of the Prime Minister ... All members accused of fraud were dismissed. You, you now obey the new manager. We ship Nambu. The Japanese government has already accepted. Heard. Nothing happens… Why ? This could be explained by a lack of power. What? It's possible? - You know the power of Case. - This is not the same as with Kaido? Its original power is gone with him. Perhaps it is only a fragment, an echo, that stayed with Emi. But in the world where I was ... It can make small miracles in your home world. This is perhaps its limit today. It's not true… We can not dispel it? Let's think, there must be a way! It destroyed the device that sucks the energy? It does not fundamentally solve anything. The energy extraction has already been arrested. If the flow of energy coming to saturate space, it should begin to spread. The evening irrégularité plus petite et Emi arrive peut-être à la dissiper. What optimism ... You have gone too far. I warned you. Use the Nexus would have allowed us to create the ultimate weapon that destroyed the Galactors. Instead, you're used to create Bird Suits. Why ? Because humans are part of your hypothetical threat. To counter an invasion, better armor that fits. Just then passing on the side of the invaders. You are formidable. No way to let someone like you to another country. Mine, however, is ready to make a deal with you. Without the UN, of course. Provided to share the benefits? It is unfair that only one country is powerful. There must be a deterrent. You've watched? Do you want to arrest and kill or you accept our offer? It's a simple question. My wish is to make humanity stronger. I have no use of your offer. Exits to sacrifice distant countries? Everyone can not become strong. As well, those who possess the force must use. What is it ? You have not heard a voice? No, you have dreamed. Dr. Nambu! Emi! Emi! It will not? I just bumped ... Bird Go ! What is he doing ? No, he took the energy! Hey ! You have nothing ? Beware, the next shot will be powerful. Pegas, Tekksetter! Affirmative! Stay here. I believe I will not want to move. Joe, do not go! All you want is to kill him. Let us do. You think you have a choice? Stop, doctor Nambu! If you continue to tap into the Nexus, you know what will happen to this world! Words can reach it more. Bird Go ! You formed the Science Ninja Team to protect humanity! So why ? - I did not change. - What? I had no strength, so I lost my precious comrades. Maybe, but before, you were right! I was right ... It told me what to be right? Do you know what it like to see your friends get killed without resistance? You feel so helpless! I would have protected if only I had the strength! - Go ahead ! - Ultra-destructive radius! Swelling! You are a coward. Pardon ? For fear of losing someone, you kill with your own hands. That's childish. It's pitiful. When I think that I obeyed you, I want to vomit! I do not know how you feel, but what is certain is that you are weak! You were not like that before! Hold your tongue. The one who gave me the title of Gatchaman and said that it represented hope, - it was you, right? - Shut up! Ken… Stopped… Who are you ? Stop him… What? What are you doing ? Stopped ! Stopped ! It will not, right? Why are you doing this ? I do not know, I do what I said Case. What do you mean ? It's okay, I think. This is the Nexus? There is something. A bird. Non. This is the Bird Run Gatchaman. Stop the doctor. This light ... The Case of power is lodged in? It's impossible ! Ken uses this Bird Run! Stop, Ken! Go away ! You not escape me! Attends, Joe ! The irregularity quickly loses energy. What is it this time? It starts to level. Energy has reached saturation and suddenly reverse. Not like you planned? No, the energy moves too quickly. And what will it happen? If a surplus of energy moves, it will create a shortage located. Shibuya The energy will disappear and everything will fall apart. We can do what? The upgrading is a temporary phenomenon. If it could end before ... And the building that was hit, it will go? There was still people at the ceremony. Nambu ! More a gesture. Only this weapon will be able to deliver it. This man still has services to surrender. So that was it. From the beginning, your goal, is the Nexus. Dr. Nambu is still the only one to know transform the energy of the Nexus. His genius should serve to maintain order in the world. You are all too rotten, when you are imbued with power. Justice… It's not my thing. Cease fire! Wait. Le Bird Signal ? Joe? Where are you ? What is it ? Joe ! Joe ! Joe ! Why ? Dazzling… Hold on, Joe! Joe ! Joe ! You really going to stay in this world? Yes. It has failed to dispel the Nexus. The doctor is no longer, but there will be other attackers. That's right, someone has to monitor. The device that sucked the energy of the world no longer exists. It will slowly alternate between concentration and distribution, and it will eventually stabilize. But that could take years. When the dust settles and when I have managed to dispel the Nexus, I go home too. So in the meantime, is counting on us to protect your world. Yes, we'll manage. Thank you. Emi, you have nothing to say? Not even "goodbye"? Non. It suits you, you, take everything on your shoulders? I think it's stupid. Yes that's fine. Three months have passed since the incident caused by Nambu Kozaburo and the disappearance of the Nexus. The government was aware of the dangers, but entrusted the management to Nambu ... You will kill me ? I do not perform like that.
