Mars Written and directed by P. Klushantsev Everything has begun that fabulous night in 1877, almost a century ago. Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli came to his observatory. It was a very silent night. Schiaparelli led his telescope to Mars. Even in such good weather conditions the vision is not clear. But then he saw the straight lines on the surface of the planet. He couldn?t believe his eyes. ?It?s not an illusion, I must draw it down!? Schiaparelli called those lines the channels. A conventional name, because they were of many km in width. Later he wrote about these channels: ?Their strange look and geometrical correctness led many people to the thought that they were built by some creatures living on this planet. I can?t neglect this theory because it has nothing impossible in itself.? Schiaparelli had on his mind the opinion of the American astronomer Percival Lowell. Lowell had built a special observatory to study Mars. He created a theory of Martian civilization. This theory caused a lot of arguments and worldwide attention. But there were no proofs. In 50 years science and technic developed. The automatic prospectors flew to the planets of our galaxy. ?Mars-1? was the first one. The space era has begun. Still, Mars is a mysterious planet. The main question is if there is life on Mars. The famous Russian scientist G. Tikhov, the founder of astrobotany, has studied this question for many years. Today many scientists write about the possibility of life on Mars. But we must know the physical conditions of the planet. So a great work of gathering facts is necessary. A lot of new sensational theories appear and become the basis for serious scientific works. Then the theories collapse, and the new ones appear on their ruins. But we are still far from the truth. Is Mars a dead planet or a flourishing one? Are the satellites of Mars artificial or not? Mars became the main topic in the arguments between optimists and pessimists. The optimists are more active ? they talk about mind on Mars. What if there are Martians? Are they cruel, as H. Welles thought, or kind and beautiful, as in ?Aelita? by A. Tolstoy? It is very interesting. The world is preparing for the assault of Mars. Soon we will know everything, but the truth can be staggering. We must sort out all the materials that we already have. So we shouldn?t waste our time. What are the physical conditions on Mars? We like warmth. Is there warmth on Mars? It is far from the Sun; maybe it is unbearably cold there. Here in Crimea observatory we?ve measured the temperature on the surface of Mars. V. Moroz, Ph. D, guided this work. Now we know the temperature conditions on Mars quite well. We can be carried there in our imagination. It is warm on Martian equator at noon, and it becomes cold in the evening. And at night the strongest frost appears. In the morning the temperature raises quickly. The climate is harder then we have in mountains. But in comparison with the Moon Mars is a resort. We, people of Earth, breathe. We need air. Is there air on Mars? Yes, there is. Without the layer of air Mars would look this way, as the Moon. There is atmosphere, but what kind of it? We use spectroscopy to find out. The sunrays have complex nature. The atmosphere detains some part of the rays. The black lines appear in specter. With the help of this analysis we found out that the air on Mars contains a lot of CO2, a bit of H2O, and the rest is either N2 (as on Earth), or Ar. So far no oxygen has been found. V. Moroz thinks that the density of atmosphere on Mars is around 1/100 of atmosphere on Earth. The American spaceship confirmed this theory. It defined the density of atmosphere on Mars by fading of radio signals. Here on Earth the atmosphere is 100 times rarified on the height of 30 km. Only balloons and special planes can fly here. They could fly also on Mars but near the surface. But the ?Mariner? data can be inaccurate. It could check the density on the level of mountains, and near the surface it could be higher. But we?d still need the space suit. We, people of Earth, drink. Is there water on Mars? Now we are in the observatory in Pulkovo. N. Kozyrev, Ph.D., leads the observation. The dark masses on the surface of Mars were initially mistreated as the water resources. They were called seas. But water would shine under the sun, and the seas are matt, the whole planet is dry land. Still there is moisture. We can observe morning fog and small clouds. The main water resources on Mars are contained in polar caps. It probably is a layer of hoarfrost. How much water is there on Mars? Let?s collect it and spill all over the planet. The whole layer would be only a few mm deep. The same operation on Earth would cause a water layer 3 km deep. Mars is drier than Earth, and far damper than the Moon. So what result do we have? Mars has almost no water, bits of atmosphere, probably without oxygen, a bit of warmth. The conditions on Mars are very hard. Is life there possible? What does biology say? What does our experience say? The life on Earth is impossible without water. It is in all our organisms. It contains nourishing elements. That?s why life must have appeared in ocean. And only then it came on land. It led to certain problems, first of all, to the lack of moisture. But life showed a great ability of adaptation. Plants in desert learned to pull water from the deep, to use morning dew, to create water reserves inside themselves. In general, plants do not need a lot of moisture. A sunflower drinks a lot in summer. But for the building of its tissue it spends only a glass of water. Two more liters it needs to saturate with juices. It also spends 55% of moisture on evaporation, to avoid overheating. There can be no such need on Mars. And such plant would be satisfied with a spoon of water per day. Let?s come back to the desert. Plants collect moisture inside themselves. Animals get moisture by eating these plants. The bigger animals get moisture by eating the smaller ones. But what if there was no water at all? The kangaroo rat can leave weeks without water. It eats dry grains and produces water with the help of special ferments, which split molecules of carbohydrates. A lack of moisture for plants and animals is an overcoming problem. The other one ? cold ? is more serious. The liquid protoplasm of living organisms is against hard frosts of Arctic. And again we can find examples of adaptation. Lobelia, which grows in mountains, takes the form of a sphere at night. There is positive temperature inside. In the middle latitude, some plants sleep the whole winter. But the process of conifer?s photosynthesis continues the whole year. Water in its cells stays in liquid form, because of special ferments that stop freezing. Many animals fall in anabiosis in winter. Larvae of a corn butterfly hide in corn stalks. They freeze and the water in their tissues turns into ice. In lab they can be frozen up to the temperature of liquid Helium: -269 C. They rock like stones. But being warmed, they come back to life. Warm-blood is a most effective way of fighting cold. Such animals are heated from inside. They create in themselves an environment needed for a normal functioning of their organisms. It is very cold, but penguins are in a good mood. They walk and sit out their nestlings. They are sure, that there is no such cozy place in the world. The adaptation of life is incredible. The geysers have the temperature of around 90 C, but water-plants are alive. Their cells contain special protein, that doesn?t coagulate in such conditions. The seabed. Constant darkness, only bits of oxygen. And still there is life. There is no oxygen on the bottom of the Black Sea. The water is full of hydrogen sulfide. But if you take a sample of this water you will find there some organisms, bacteria. The microorganisms that can live without oxygen are found even in oil taken from the bowels of the earth. Different bacteria can be found in the radioactive water of the nuclear reactor, in sulfuric acid, in the dust in stratosphere. The spores of bacteria don?t die even in space, under pressure of radiation. Many scientists study the adaptability of living organisms. In the Leningrad Institute of Cytology, in the Laboratory of space biology professor Lozina-Lozinsky tries to answer a question if there is scope for life, and if yes, is Mars included in it? The Earth gives us many examples of hard conditions. This device is called Photostat. Ernest Zaar is one of its founders. Now another group of earthmen goes to Mars: larvae of a corn butterfly, worms unseen by unaided eye and the smallest infusorian. Here they are alive and active. We spill the water with infusorian on the sand. Than we put the subject of our experiment into the Photostat. We asked to put there a glass of clear water to show how quickly water evaporates in vacuum. This water will disappear during the day. Now air is being pumped out the camera, and the nitrogen is being pumped in. The pressure of atmosphere is as on Mars. The automatic program of day and night changing is switched on. The experiment has begun. It is hard for our animals. They suffer from the lack of oxygen. But atmosphere in this chamber is being renewed every minute. Maybe this fact will help them to gather appropriate amount of oxygen. But still moisture evaporates very quickly. There is such low pressure inside the chamber that even cold water boils. This way would our blood boil if we appeared on Mars without the space suit. The special lamps fill the chamber up with ultraviolet. The atmosphere of Mars can?t delay this part of radiation. The program says that it is night. The electric sun sets. The radiation stopped. But the frost began to intensify. How do our animals feel? Maybe they are already dead? But then our hope to find on Mars some creatures that look like us will also die. The experiment lasted a couple of days. The 10th morning came. The sun rose on our artificial Mars and it begun to thaw out. And we are running, hurrying, hastening. Forgetting that at the same time scientists solve such a grandiose problems. Are we, the earthmen, alone? Or are we a part of a Sun family, settled in different planets? The larvae are dead. Vacuum killed them. And what about nematodes? They are alive. But they spent 10 days in anabiosis. However, sleep is not death. The sand contained water, and infusorian fell asleep only at night. They led an active life, even propagated. So our experiment succeeded, there are such protozoa that can live on real Mars. They would sleep in difficult periods of time, and lead a normal life in favorable periods. Life could have appeared on Mars billions of years ago, and now there could be developed forms of live. However, the life on Mars is possible, and if so maybe it can be discovered. But how? What can we see on Mars through millions of km? Here on Earth in such conditions the Crimea would be an almost invisible dot. And it?s 300 km in size. Still ac. Barabashov looks in the telescope. Why? Isn?t this technic old?fashioned now, when we send satellites in space to make photos from close distance? These photos of Mars made by ?Mariner-4?. Great photos, we can see Martian mountains for the first time. Every photo captured the area close in width to the Crimea. This area looked like a dot in telescope, but now we can see a lot of details. But it is still not enough for the search of live. The smallest object like this crater is a couple of km in size. Look at the photos of Earth made from satellite. That?s Italy. The white spots are clouds. The Caspian Sea. The Sinai Peninsula. The Nile. The Baltic Sea. The Finnish Bay. The Black Sea and the Crimea. Good photos, but Martians wouldn?t find any life on Earth with their help. Even such big cities like Leningrad cannot be seen on them. So it?s pointless to search life on Mars with ?Mariner?s? photos. And how to search? How to distinguish organic from inorganic? Now we see that telescope isn?t old-fashioned. It helps to observe Mars for months, and what is invisible in static becomes visible in dynamic. Mars moves on orbit, the sun lights up its pole, and this hemisphere has spring. Inorganic is indifferent to it, but what about organic? We have the melting of snow, the water warms up, the ground comes to light, the first brooks purl and interflow in rapid streams. The nature wakes up, the great symphony of life begins. The colorless vegetation darkens, becomes green. Would Mars react on the appearance of warmth? Look at the borders of the snow cover. See, the seas near it darken and change their color. The snow cover steps back to the pole. Imagine how something alive reaches for the sun, something familiar and clear. Isn?t it beautiful? But it?s only a dream. Let?s answer this question in cold blood. The bright spots are dry and lifeless deserts. The sands stretch for hundred and thousands kilometers. But what can be the dark spots but vegetation? What if it is some kind of a cloud? No, the seas on Mars are too stable to be clouds. Probably they are peculiarities of a relief. As on the Moon, these seas can be plains of dark stoned lava. Or they are the dark rocks in the middle of deserts, or maybe none of it because these areas have similar relief. But they should differ from each other. We managed to measure the temperature of seas and deserts separately. The seas are warmer. You think that this is the warmth of life but it isn?t. Remember that leaves are colder than stones. Plants spend part of warmth on evaporation of water and on chemical processes, and the dark stones are warmer than the light, just because everything dark gets warmer. So the easiest way to explain these seas is to say that they are the dark rocks. But the rocks are stable and the delineation of these seas change with time. Here is the example. There were stains here but now they are gone. The delineation of the Sun Lake differs very much. Here the new dark area appeared. Stones are incapable of this. However the American scientist McLaughlin thought that the inorganic could change due to wind and dilapidation. Let?s concede, he said, that Martian volcanoes produce a great amount of dark dust. The wind moves these clouds, and ash falls down creating the dark areas. The sand covers this ash. After the new eruption the wind can blow in other direction, so the delineation of ashes varies. It would be a good hypothesis if ash could flourish in spring. In the Kharkov observatory ac. Barabashov explores how Martian seas and deserts reflect the light. The desert reflects light as plane and smooth surface. The seas disperse light that means that their surface is uneven. Uneven and changing its colour surface has the massif of plants. There is one more argument pro plants. There are sandstorms on Mars. It is scary in such time. The sand ocean is awake; the vortex of stone dust gets wild, the sand clouds hide the sun. Tornados mix the desert with the sky. Millions of tones of sand begin to whirl. And then it all falls somewhere in hundreds of kilometers, hides the dark stones and ashes, makes the planet look like desert. But the dark spots on Mars remain. Only life can resist the sandstorms. Only organic can germinate through the sand. So the dark spots on Mars can be explained by vegetable life. Ac. Barabashow thinks the same: ?There are enough evidences to answer positively on a question about life on Mars.? Martian seas are probably zones of life. But what kind of life? Martian plants should have a lot of peculiarities. How can we find out anything? We know that there is a special course of spring. Here on Earth plants blossom out at first in South, in Crimea. And then this process starts in North ? in Kiev, then Moscow, Leningrad. The warmth goes from equator to pole. And vise versa on Mars - from pole to equator. This seems ridiculous. Earth plants have routs in moist ground, so they use local water. They need only warmth to wake them up. Martian plants do not react on warmth, because they are submerged into dry ground. Water comes from pole, from melting snow. This is imported water. But how does water reach them? There is not enough water on Mars to create a stream. And probably moisture created by melting evaporates avoiding liquid phase. This steam can be transported by wind and at night it will become hoarfrost. But winds cannot explain the whole system of water supply on Mars. Lowell thought that the mystery of hydrologic cycle on Mars was connected with its strange channels. What are the Martian channels? These dark lines are remarkable. They do not break in the middle. It seems that they connect some important centers. Mars is covered with mountains and the channels use the shortest ways ignoring all obstacles. Here and there channels are seen against the background of seas. Some channels double themselves in a specific season. In winter these mysterious lines cannot be seen. In spring the surface of Mars darkens beginning with seas and channels. They must have similar nature. Being zoomed in, the channels disintegrate into separate spots. On these photos the channels cannot be seen. That?s why skeptics doubt that they exist at all. That?s not true. Take a random newspaper photo and zoom it. The image disappears, and only dots are left. But you can?t claim that there is no photo. It exists but the image can be read only from distance. After the analysis of the photos some spots and unevenness were discovered. That can be lefts of plants that create an image of lines from distance. So the channels are not an illusion. But what will our satellites find on their place? The file of craters with green plants inside, or maybe the mountains gathering moisture from air, or dunes covering something alive from hurricanes, or ravines where moisture comes out from depth? Whatever it is, it?s still unclear why do these details of relief create such a strange net. Relief of a planet corresponds with fracture in the rock strata. But on Earth relief doesn?t create such net as on Mars. American scientist Alan Webb mathematically analyzed the net of Martian channels. He compared it to the scratches on the dry ground, to the cracks on a china vase, to a spider?s web, and to the net of roads in Ohio, USA. The analysis led to an interesting result. Martian channels are close to an artificial net of roads. Webb thought that these channels are traces of plants along some service lines. We want to remind you of the words of ac. Kuprevich: ?The origin of such formation cannot be explained by natural causes. This is a creation of mind and will?. Well said, but let?s be careful. We finish the study of channels with the following quotation: ?We can find all the truth only there, on-site?. Now we?re able analyze on-site only on the Moon. But soon the similar machines will land on Mars too. And we will wait for the first reports. At first the robots will look for bacteria. The device will suck the dust from Martian ground. Then the special process will show if there are any bacteria. If yes, they will propagate. The radio will inform that there is life on Mars. This device will also look for bacteria. If will fire a shot with a scotch tape and ?lick off? the dust. These robots will be very complicated, but we will never be able to trust them fully. Imagine this robot?s work on Mars: it will land, turn an antenna, find Earth and say: ?Landed successfully?. Meanwhile, the robot will start his analysis. It will examine the area and show us the desert, the dead planet. But the robot won?t examine the place of its own landing. We will be sad. Maybe there are at least bacteria? The robot will act following the program, but it can?t foresee everything. The tape will gather some dust, and the capstan will pull it into. The insect will get to the chamber where analysis takes place. And then another mistake will take place. The breeding ground appears to be very tasty. We will wait but we won?t be able to see that the light goes through the empty glass. The robot will report that no bacteria were found. So there is no life on Mars? Complete silence. Strange world, dead world. Despite all the progress in robot technics only human can solve the mysteries of Mars. It will take time to make it possible. We will fly around and look closely. It?s scary. There were examples that people sent animals ahead. The first earthman on Mars will probably be quadruped. What will it see? We can try to imagine Martian plants, departing from our plants living in hard conditions. Protect our plants from winds, frost, and drought ? like many scientists did thinking up Martian flora. The fundamental works in this field belong to soviet scientist G. Tikhov. He though that Martian plants look similar to ours from tundra, mountains and the Arctic. He said that these plants must be undersized, grass and bushes at first. They can be of blue or purple colour due to hard conditions. Not everyone agrees with Tikhov. Soviet astronomer Lubarsky claims the opposite: ?There should be red or brown colours, but not blue as Tikhov claims.? But the words of American astronomer Sallsbery sound also verisimilar: ?Temperature drop should?ve caused the development of pigmentation which makes the plants look black. Martian plants should expose wide plane surface to the sun. Turning into a tube at night would reduce the loss of warmth?. On the other hand, ac. Fesenkov said that there couldn?t be any higher plants on Mars at all. But the existence of lichen, algae, and bacteria cannot be neglected. Ac. Fesenkov describes cheerless Mars. We prefer another, optimistic theory of ac. Kuprevitch. According to him, the relief that we believe to be covered with lichen is covered indeed with higher plants. We?d like to believe our quadruped astronaut'll see such Mars, blooming, full of sounds and colors. Sallsbery made an interesting claim. There are indeed some forms of flora on Mars. It leaves a step, but a huge step to higher forms of life. We must be prepared for everything, to stand the encounter with Martian inhabitants. Everything is possible. And until the man lands on Mars its mysteries will torment us. The main question is who is there. The theory of Martians wasn?t neither confirmed nor disproved. What if Lowell was right? What if we will see structures of a unique civilization? What if the channels are a huge irrigation system? With the help of these strange hydro-technical devices Martians collect the moisture from poles, and direct it to the equatorial districts of the planet. It is easier to live there. The tubes stretch for a thousand km. The plantations are situated along them. And the crossings of the channels are the centers of Martian civilization, the cities. But what if it is all opposite? We will see the traces of a long-dead civilization: the ruins sleeping for thousands of years, the buildings, which were full of life many years ago, the evidences of existence of a mysterious nation that didn?t wait for us. And only the orbital city, created by genious engineers, continues to fly around the planet. It flies in the dark abyss ? slowly, with its lights off, a silent monument of the great mind. It is Phoebus, the satellite of Mars, which will never stop. But probably everything will be much simpler. And we will say about the channels: ?We should have guessed!? Let?s speculate. The channels look like a system of communication. But even animals sometimes create structures that look artificial. Bee honeycombs for instance, or beaver weirs. What are the schemes of bird migration or the tracks of eel that crossed Atlantic Ocean, if not a system of communication? So the channels can be routes of some living creatures? migration. Guided by an instinct, they bring moisture from poles to equatorial lands. There are a lot of them. They move in a shortest way, using the cracks of surface. The plants grow along these tracks. They use water and give these animals shadow and food instead. Sure, it is merely a fantasy. We can create a lot of such theories. It is not bad, because we cannot cognize the world without fantasy, without this great quality of human soul. Don?t be afraid to dream, go and make your landing on Mars. Today! Now. The first man on Mars. The sun will rise in an hour and light this unique world up. In an hour we will unravel all the mysteries that bothered us for ages. But it?s so hard to wait this hour. The sky lightens. These white smokes must be geysers or evaporation of hoarfrost. And what if they woke up? The lights flashed out in mountains. That can be either the sun lights or the lights in the castle of Aelita. People of Earth! Stand up, and be ready. It?s a great moment ? we discover a new planet. The discovery of Mars. The end.
