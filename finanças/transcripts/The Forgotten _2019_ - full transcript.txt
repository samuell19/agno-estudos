I'm sorry, I'm looking for the retraining course for Ukrainian teachers. I don't know! I'm looking for the retraining course. Second floor, room 34. Thank you! Only Russian's spoken at school. I can... Thank you. Colleagues, the retraining course lasts 3 months. It costs 19,000 rubles. You can choose between Russian and English. I don't speak English. How are we to learn English in three months? I can't either. And you? Speak English? No, I can't. Then the “great and mighty” language it is. But with Russian there are, fewer vacancies. With English you have more chances. Here are the application forms, with the timetable and the curriculum from the new cultural office. Any questions? Please fill it out! A mushroom once thought of something and started giving orders. Come, porcini mushrooms and go to war with me! The porcini mushrooms said no. Chanterelle, will you go to war with me? We are rich, we don't need war! Birch milklings, are you going to war with me? We are housewives, we're not going to war! Honey mushrooms, will you go to war with me? Our stems are too narrow, we won't come. Milk mushrooms, will you go to war with me? We milk mushrooms stick together. We'll go to war with you! So, the Tsar went to war with the mushrooms! What is this? Come, quickly! Tell Father Frost, where is your home? My home is Russia! I have a special gift for you. Such an idiot! What are you doing? I bought the same one for my son. Look! Look! What's going on? Sergei Viktorovich, someone hung up the Ukrainian flag. The police are coming! Come quickly. Idiots. That's all we need! What are you watching? Go! What are you doing here? This is the ladies room! Have you seen a boy with a dark jacket and hood? 10th or 11th grade? No, this is the ladies room! Get out! I'm about to pee my pants, if you don't leave! You want to join me? Let's go! Put that in my purse. Take off your jacket. What are you looking at? Take it off! If they catch you with that... Go! What is it? Do you want to pee? We go together! You can't leave on your own. Yes... he is slim... There! Stop! Where are you going? Stop! Freeze... Stop him! Ah, a known fool. His mother disappeared. Father was murdered. He was also for the "Ukrops". Now he lives with his grandmother. It's the first time this has happened at our school. We have a good reputation! What'll happen to him? You have lessons! He's still underage... You can't just... He's only a child. He just wanted attention. You're the director, aren't you? Say something! Who are you? I am a teacher. I used to teach at school number 46. Why don't you talk to them? They'll kill him in there. I already warned him: "It's your last year of school, behave yourself!" He threw it all away... You don't look like a teacher. More like... Be quiet! Where are they taking him? Are you a relative? No. We're done. We go now. I'll tell his grandma. Yeah. No problem. We'll let her know as well. Nina! They're waiting for us. Are you OK? Yes, I just forgot that the parties start so early now. 15 please! To the front. To the front! Thank you all for being here. We miss you, so we wanted to celebrate Tanya's birthday at home. Why did you leave? Come back! I'd love to. Chaos is everywhere. Here in Luhansk, at least it's our chaos! In Kyiv it is not. Here our party costs half as much as in Ukraine. But it's not because of that. Tanyechka wanted us to celebrate here. To my treasure! All the best! Tanusha, your tits got bigger. Be quiet! Kirill, why are you so tanned? We just got back from Egypt. Did you go from Ukraine or Russia? From Russia, of course. I also made a Russian passport. Yura, and you? I have all three: Russian, Ukrainian and LNR. Nina refuses the Russian. That's why I'm so white. What's the point, Nina? I can't live without holidays. You have to leave this place from time to time. By the way, have you found anything yet? No. I started this retraining course. Great, finally you will teach in the pure Russian language and not your farmer's language. Farmer's language? Ghena, hold me. Moo on! What a cow, this teacher. Nina! Leave me alone! What am I supposed to do? They're sheep. Pay no attention to them. You're sitting at a table with these sheep. Don't be so pathetic. You knew who was coming today and you provoked them even more. I provoked them? Whom did I provoke? Then what's this all about? I forgot the party was today. And then you wonder. I can get fired for it. Nobody needs us there without money. So folks, come on! Fuck that! Let's keep celebrating! Ninok! Yura, I want to go away. I can't yet. I'll do anything so we can leave this place. We will drive! Yuri! Go on. You have to go back. I'm waiting for you at home. Hello, There is no internet connection at 12 Zoryanskaya Street. Alright. To the front. Move, damn! Damn it! Goddamn it! When did you get home? Have you slept at all? No, I didn't. The machine in the warehouse broke down. I've been hand glueing this shit all night. After you left, the couple apologized. I told them it was too much. They didn't think. Vera isn't the brightest... and Gena only talks nonsense when he's drunk. I was drunk as a hatter. I glued as much as I could. Look. Is that too crooked? Give me a few more months. I'll find something. But after displays like yesterday... people like to talk. You should continue attending this course. I'm looking for something in Kyiv. Alright? Damn! Nina, I'm afraid I don't have time. Can you do that? Hello children! May I? You again? I'm attending a retraining course here. Very good. Say... have you heard about the boy? Has he been released? We couldn't reach his grandma. Maybe the police told her. So he's still there? How should I know? I could have gotten into trouble because of him. Hopefully nothing happens. All the best. Ladies, you're already here? The most important thing we have to focus on, is encouraging patriotism in the children. But we live in an imaginary republic. What will they be patriots of? I did not write this program. All the textbooks are from Russia. Those are the rules there. Special attention is paid to poetry. With the help of poetry we teach the youth to love the fatherland. I have printed examples for you. I still don't understand. Why should our children become Russian patriots? Why? Because we don't have any other textbooks! None. Well then. An important part of language education, Is the preparation for various holidays. One of the most important holidays is February 23rd. Preparations for Soviet Army Day must be part of the curriculum. Today we'll write a simple test, to identify your weaknesses, and see who has a chance to pass. Check out this piece of equipment. Impressive... Everything's taken care of at checkpoint number four. You can drive through after 4 PM. He'll do it. We have two of our officers there. What's that? Ah, from Russia. Chinese natural, super soft and cheap. Sells well. Show them. Cool idea! Respect. Can you trust him? I've been through a lot with Yuri. He's a chemist. You've seen "Breaking Bad"? I think so... Yuri can build you the same lab. I think there That's a long time ago. Come on! Do you get it now? As soon as everything is ready, you drive. Why did you tell them about the lab? Coward! Goodbye! Goodbye. Hello. Hello. Andrei. Vasiliy. Why are you here? Hung the wrong flag in the wrong place. Alright. I don't care. And why are you here? My wife is in a wheelchair. For three years... because of the bombing... I wanted to buy her orthopedic tights, I was on my way back and saw a guy, harassing a young girl in an underpass. Me, old ox, stood up for her. He immediately pointed a gun at me and called the cops. Fucking shit. And the girl? When the police came, the girl said that she knew him. And that I'm the pervert. Then they found the tights and took it as evidence. Motherfuckers. Assholes, They're everywhere. You have to be optimistic. When will it stop? When does it stop? I want to pick it up in a separate room. Follow me. OK. Tell Kirill... What? What's that? Fucking pigeons... How am I supposed to go to the ministry tomorrow? You can change at home. I hate those birds. Right now everything's settled with the bank. You can bring the rest in the morning. Brothers today, enemies tomorrow, you understand. Sure, no problem. We hope there'll be Internet sometime. They all have to be shot. Fucking critters! With online banking it becomes more and more difficult. Let's look for other ways. Alright? Alright, then. Hello. Yura, where are you? I can't hear you. Yura. I'm in Stanitsia Luhanska. You can see the river at the border. In the last hour, LNR was attacked several times by Ukrainians. When are you going to stop? I can't stand it anymore. We won't shoot anymore today. Really? We have state treason story left... Some idiot hung up a flag. So, do we have it? How many years do you get for treason? 20? I don't know. Come on, let's finish this. Hello, is the boy from school #33 with you? We don't need boys, bring girls. He's about 17, hung up the flag. No, we have a few for breaking the curfew. It's quiet today. Thank you. Where else could they have taken him? Wherever. Reznitskaya St. 2, or Bogdanovka St. 15. Thank you. Is the student here because of the flag? Yes. May I see him? No. Listen, he's a minor. He can't stay here a second night. He can climb roofs... but he can't sit in the cell? Let me talk to him. Are you a relative? He only has one sick grandma. No one can visit him. I'm his teacher. You know what, come with me. Go inside. Sit down. Wait. Where's the boy? Sit down. Let him go. I'll pay the fine. I'll sign for him. A year ago he'd been shot on the spot for the Ukrainian flag. Sit down. Today he'll get a 4 year sentence. That counts as treason. What nonsense. Listen... I can really pay you. You know what, we love to jerk off. Yes, squirting is our thing. Look at this. We're not rapists. We're not gonna fuck you. But we want to see everything. Shall we? If you want to set him free... then get undressed. The sooner the better. Or should we teach him a lesson. Has he fucked you yet? What do you think? He wouldn't be able to sit for two months or go to the toilet. Decide... We don't force anyone. Take off your underpants. Spread your legs. Come on. Just think of him. Or can't you think right now? Why are you so quiet? That's it. Good girl... That's the way it has to be. Very well-behaved. It's the first time we've had one like you. Good girl. See, we're not touching you at all. Sweetheart... Ilchenko, out. Forward. Move! Here you go. Here you go, now you can shoot new videos. You're truly an angel! Did you pay them? How much do I owe you? The curfew is in effect. The bus doesn't run anymore. This is yours. I'll take you home. I know a safe way. What did you teach? Ukrainian. And why didn't you leave? My husband's against it. He has a job here. And you? I have... my grandma here. She raised me. My father worked for a Ukrainian newspaper. One day he was arrested, tortured in a basement and then murdered. Grandma has no one but me. Why not leave with Grandma? She's bedridden. Did they see us? All's well. But we have to be quiet. Yes? I'm with a friend from the school. I forgot the curfew started. You don't have to pick me up. Go to sleep. Yeah, I love you, too. I can't lie well. I think they're good at it. How do you say "dwarves" in Ukrainian? "Dwarves". It's the same thing. My Ukrainian sucks. I had a 3. And how do you say "giant"? "VELETEN". "Veleten", funny. What's funny about that? I was thinking, we are all like dwarves. We live in the land of giants. They can do whatever they want to us. The curfew lasts until four. Call your grandma. She's used to it... I know where we can wait until sunrise. We're almost there. This used to be an insulation factory. It was already dilapidated before the war. There was an art gallery here. Modern artists, Then the separatists came, and destroyed everything. Never heard of it. People were executed here. Come. Come, come. You said you lived with your grandma, Yes, I did. She died a year ago. But according to documents, she's still alive. It's okay. She's one of us. Grandma died after my father was killed. The soldiers came to us... and said we had to leave the apartment. Grandma didn't want to move out, and died that night. I think she swallowed some pills. Someone helped me cover up her death, so I can collect her pension in Ukraine. Tomorrow I have to go again. That's a dead man, isn't he? How can you cover that up? You know, that we live in Wonderland, here you can do everything. Who are these men? They belong to us, Ukrainians. Some are wanted, Others are on the death list, and some try to fight from here. Sometimes I shoot videos, as if journalists were here. People who care. Like they're doing an interview with me. If it's good, I'll put it on the Internet. Do you really think you can prove something? No. I don't want anyone to forget us here. We're indifferent to each other. When I pick up grandma's pension in Ukraine, I feel hatred towards us, as if we're traitors. How old are you? 17? Patriot and idiot rhyme, did you know that? You probably have a family? Husband, Children maybe? I only have this town. Six years ago it belonged to me, now only the military is in charge here. Interview, you say? Hello, Andrey May I ask you something? I am Julia, from the "Beautiful Life channel." Tell us... What is "the Luhansk People's Republic" like? This is a live broadcast. Like? Like bad sex. You so wanted it, you're already inside, but it doesn't work. Everyone wanted something here, but nothing worked. That is a stupid comparison... Well, our show is also watched by grannies. Next question, I am Tatyana, from the "YuYuYu" shows... How is life in the occupied territory? Do you have a feeling, how can I say it... of hopelessness? Yes, hopelessness. There is. It's possible to live inside an ass, and get used to it. You think you're not inside an ass. And many here think that way. Some take courses to be fashion models, hoping for an international career, Others attend "Team building" courses. Aren't these illusions? But, even up the ass, like you said, people want to hope, dream, love... What do you dream of at your age? Do you have a dream? Dream? Yes, right now. That they'll get rid of the curfew. I'd like to hang out in the city center, and listen to music until the morning. Then with a beautiful girl... and the rest is clear, right? Only I can't imagine the girl. Everyone I know here, doesn't matter... I'm just imagining you. That was "Beautiful Life" with Tatyana, until the next time. Nina, Here's a tea. I didn't know you were tired. Here, two blankets. It's always cold here, even in the summer. Don't worry about it. I'll rest for a few hours and go home. If anything... I'll be in the next room. And which girlfriend did we stay with? Is it really a girlfriend? Stop it. I don't ask you when you're out. Did you rob a bank? No, just returned the bottles for a refund. Can we leave now? Not now, but we'll leave soon. Soon we won't care where we live. They're watching us, the assholes. Where are the international observers when they're shooting? They'll immediately ask you why, how... In Sloviansk, potatoes are 5 hryvnia cheaper. I'm allowed to buy vegetables. Only 3 kilos of potatoes allowed! No, you can only drink 3 litres of milk. Why don't they open a Ukrainian bank in Luhansk? My knee, From the bus, my knees hurt. In Russia the pensions are certainly better. My daughter is in Ekaterinburg. That depends. In Crimea they're miserly. Prepare your documents! Are you going to the class? I can pick you up afterwards. I'm incredibly tired. I'm not going today. It's bullshit anyway. You're a smart girl. But you have to show your face. Tonight we go see the Night Wolves. I don't like these bikers... Let's stay home. What do you like anyway? Can I pick it up in a separate room? I saw 18 in the south. Without numbers. I couldn't send any videos. There was no Internet. And the cops deleted everything from my phone. But I know the exact place. Is it possible now? Wait, wait... We need you there. We'll stay with the grandma covery story for now. In the north-east, near the transmission tower. We think we saw new graves by satellite. Check it out. What a load of shit! What a bummer! It was probably hard to see there was paint there. We need pictures. So work clean. And no more any rooftop stunts. Your whole life is ahead of you. Let's go. Watch out, the color... I know that. Lousy spy! Here, this tower is used to try to broadcast Ukrainian channels. Russian TV also comes from here. I'd love to bring the tower down, but I've discovered something. There is always internet here, and the speed is amazing. Here, brand new. 33. No numbers or signs... Did you hear that? In Rostov-on-Don... 33 soldiers were killed during military exercises. Jesus was 33 years old, wasn't he? I am in the north-east. A few kilometers from the city. The broadcasting tower is close to here. Everything fine? Tomorrow at 12:00 I drive again. See! Look how big my Lena is. You should also think about it. Lena, can you see? Do you want to climb on my shoulders? Ah, shy. I'll get something to drink. Okay. Look what they're doing! I know you're Nina. And that you helped, to get a Ukrainian spy out of the police station. He's not a spy, he's a kid. Today, this child was on Ukrainian territory and received new assignments from Ukrainian intelligence. How'd you know that? May I invite you for mulled wine? Go to hell. Two please. We wanted to exchange two "Ukrops". I'll call the Ukrainian commander on the radio, to arrange the exchange. Suddenly I recognize his voice. It's Ilyuha. We studied together in Kazan. I tell him: Come to the exchange yourself. You can trust me. In short; we met, got drunk, and exchanged the guys. Now, when the "Ukrops" are preparing something, he warns me, or I warn him by SMS. Then we shoot into the empty forest to not hit each other. Who was that? Ah, I don't know. I can't let you out of my sight for a second. I want to go home. Let's finally make a baby. What child? Well, A little one at first, but with a big dick like dad's. If it's a boy, and I'm sure it will be. All these people are funny. A child, you say? Why should we make one? We could smuggle one here from Rostov-on-Don? Okay, I get it. Then we won't talk at all. You don't like anything anyway. You have children to give them a future. Some future. But there is none here. Don't you see it? Is there a future here? Pass the money forward. Are you still mad at me? I don't understand Russian. I didn't mean it that way. Yes... Here's the money. You meant it that way. “Farmer's language”, very funny. Gena and I exaggerated. He's got problems at the moment. He didn't want to talk about it at the party. Do you know this ring from my mother? Going to a jeweler now. Gena imported car parts. He was fooled by his supplier from Russia. Vera, I don't care about your problems. Nina, Do you think Yuri could lend him some money? I am not Yuri. Let him ask him. Maybe you can put in a good word. We love you and Yura. We'd help you too. Please stop. Good afternoon! How are things with you? Thank you, good. Hello... Why are you running here? Documents! Come with me! Open the door! We've been working with your checkpoint for some time. Drive to the side. We want to look at the goods. Hey guys, what are you doing? Get in the car now! Stop it! Damn it, stop it! Let's go! There you go, These are the test results. Nina, I'm sorry to disappoint you. With your test results, you have no chance. So many mistakes, there's no point in taking this course. They mixed something up. It can't be. That's what I was thinking. That's why I'm so horrified. Look... no concept of spelling. I don't understand! Give it to me! Here. This is not my writing! This is not my test. How is not yours? Same name. Your signature. It's fake. Here, give me a pen. Do you really think I'd write "illegitimate" with an N? This is bullshit! I can take the test again! No, unfortunately we don't have time. According to the rules you have to register for another course. Maybe there are still places available in school number 12. Why are you so quiet? Nina, I'm afraid you have to go. All right, then. Eat your fill with this course! And you girls can keep sitting! Wait a minute. Nina! I've been waiting for you. Are you skipping class again? The director handed me the documents back. Expelled. What's the rush? I got out, too. Because of me? I don't know. Could be. Wait, I couldn't stop thinking about you. Then don't think. You kept something from me. I couldn't. What happened? Listen, I want you to go to Ukraine immediately. I have protection. What kind of protection? You are a child. I am not afraid. You underestimate what these people are capable of... When can I see you again? Never. No one can see us together. You idiot? Go to class! What's going on here? I heard about the 4th precinct, that your teacher got a "ukrop" out of there. He's been flying flags around town. You bastards! Who touched them? Nobody. She's a teacher. I'm sure he was her student. I had no idea. You'll know if it's your whore. Like this. The truck goes back. We can't take any risks. You have 12 hours to get out of "the republic". Got it? Got it. Take your chick with you, too. Cleaning lady, you run out of the store. You heard a bang. It's terrible! Katya, you were going to the bus stop. Explosion. You're scared. You're all in shock. But you come closer. So, everyone ready? Camera rolling? After a minibus explosion on Zoryanskaya Road, 4 people lost their lives today. The locals are in tremendous shock. The police have already identified suspects. The attack was carried out by Ukrainian saboteurs, their activity in "LNR" has increased significantly. How close were you with the camera? They didn't even give me a hundred for the ring. I don't know what to do. I don't know either. Yura is not here. May I come in? Thank you. I'll pay you back! I'm afraid for this idiot. Nina. You don't understand, you have no children. Of course, I have no children... May I have some water? Thank you. My girlfriend works at the circus, These tickets are all I can give you. What are you doing? He's not answering. How much? Two thousand. Wait a minute. What happened? Yura! We have 12 hours to leave "LNR". We must be gone by noon tomorrow. Where will we go? Does it matter? Isn't it what you wanted? Did you? Are you happy now? Stop it! I lent Vera some money. How much? Two You shouldn't have given anything to that cow. Do you know what I think? As long as we're young, we're not afraid. We're not afraid of pain. We think everything heals. The older we get, the more scared we get. Most important is not to lose what you've accumulated. Fear grows. What are you getting at? The war doesn't care about our fear. It takes everything away from us. All at once. That's terrible, You know what? Right now I feel like I'm 17. I can feel pain again. Such a feeling... When do we go? In an hour? I'll go get something for the road. There is info... from the Ukrainians. The separatists are arming themselves at the border. New games. We have to meet the others. They released him so quickly. That's right. Are you ready? Andrey, come. Simon is waiting for us. We need to get going. I'm staying here. Why? What? I don't like him today. It's the woman, right? Fuck you! You too. I didn't expect it. We're leaving. When? Today. Promise me you'll be careful. You have your whole life ahead of you. Maybe something will change. Who knows how long the war will last. I heard a joke... I give you a thousand... Is it with...? Shut the fuck up. Why so sudden? You're supposed to be happy. Yura, I know it won't be easy there. I know... they manipulate us on both sides. Who are we to them? Nobody. You know... I've never idealized anyone. I'm an idiot, but I have. I idealized you. As long as people have hope, you can manipulate them. But when they grow disappointed with everything, then it becomes dangerous. I understand him. I'll kill him if I see him. But I understand... When I was 17, I had a boner all the time. Of course he's hot for you. Yura, Shut your mouth. We're almost at the border. There's no going back. Decide. You can get out. And? Look at me. I'm as good as gone. I have no words. And it hurts so much. Life goes by the bell curve. You can't even surf the Internet. Leave me alone! I can download any app. What can you do? Thank you. You spoke very well. Does anyone know what the “bell curve” is? Mine is waterproof. All iPhone 10s are. Then stick it up your ass if it's waterproof. Boys, don't forget where you are! He started it. You can talk during the break! You stupid pig! I'll smash you tomorrow! Fuck you! He claims I threw his iPhone in the toilet! It was him! Where's your cell phone? After class, it was in my pocket. Then it was found in the toilet. Now it's fucked! It's waterproof, isn't it? Look! It was him! It wasn't me! I was right outside after class. Ask Lyokha! He is also a refugee. You people from Donbass are all stupid! What did you say? Come here! Kostya, come here! I have to go. It's not over yet. Why is your cell phone off? Go to hell! Get your backpack! Your father is waiting. Go home. We'll talk tomorrow. Get back to school. Or home if you want. Where are you flying? To Berlin. I've lived there for 10 years. What were you doing in Kyiv? Visiting my sister. How's life in Berlin? They say it's better where we're not around. I've lived there for 10 years. Don't you? Fuck! Can't you see where you're going? Luhansk license plate! You drive as you please. From LNR? You're drunk. You cut me off. Fuck you! You cut me off. Where are you going? Fuck you! Hey! Hold it right there! Motherfucker! You'll be the witness! Open the trunk. My flight is in one hour. I need a new cab. Get back, get back! It won't load. They promised us high speed Internet. Everybody is raving about the new police. They'll find him. No they won't. We checked the license plate. A politician's relative. No witnesses. Why did you fall in love with me? I was just a chemist. You can't find work with this profession. I could have built a drug lab. Not even that scared you off. You believed in me. And now? Do you know what my grandma used to say? She said: "Men are like dairy products." They have an expiration date. Do you understand? If milk goes bad, what do you do? I buy new milk. Has my expiration date passed? I don't know. Let's check. We can't do it on Mr. Kociubinksy. Today in the former insulation factory in Luhansk a Ukrainian terrorist group was liquidated, they were preparing a series of attacks in the LNR.
