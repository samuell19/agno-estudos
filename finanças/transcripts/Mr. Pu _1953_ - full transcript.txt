AHH! Be careful! Sir, are you OK? [A SANEZUMI FILM] Pu-San Call an ambulance! To be honest, I thought something would happen at any moment when he was over there. The future is a sealed book! But I was looking at him from the start to finish, so I know everything that happened. After the truck drifted, the man only had to dodge a little bit. But instead, he got his legs on the hydrant, slipped and went crazy. Ouch! Stop lying, it doesn't hurt. Only your muscle moved a bit. You should feel lucky Think of what could have happened if you got buried under the truck! It had 12 tires! By now, you... I've come to Ginza for the first time in ages. Not at all! The truck came in like this, but he dodged like this. The directions were completely different. I saw it all so know everything! You know, I've come to Ginza for the first time in ages. Come here everyday for a while. What? Everyday? The condition isn't too bad but.. I.. I live in Shibuya, work in ?kubo, Shin-?kubo of the Yamanote line. This place is too far. Shibuya District, Sakura-no-oka 1-2-3-4. Yonekichi Noro. Are you siblings? No, a friend of my boss. Ah. Job is in Shinjuku, ?kubo Sakura-hoshi Academy. A math professor, 39 years old. A math professor? Doesn't look like one. Oh I remember! I have a friend who has a hospital in Shibuya. I'll introduce you. You work there? This is who I am. I make Kamabokos An accident with that big of a tire, and you'd have been squashed No, I saw all of it, he wouldn't have been in an accident. Pay the fee at reception. If somebody else is responsible why are the police here? I've come to Ginza for the first time in ages today. Yeah, that's from poor politics. Tomorrow, morning to night, I'd be sucking up fishes to make Kamabokos from them like crazy. - That's all poor politics, you know. - Politicians seem to make a lot of money. - Kamabokos selling is bad. - It's all poor politics. Hey, Gon-chan! Gon-chan! HEY! GON! This is Gonzaburo Arata. He slipped off university this year. He will have a job with my face of course but, next year, I'm thinking to putting a lot of effort into his academics. This is Yokogawa-san of the National Bank. You becoming a man like him will be a lifetime gain. I am the so-called third-class executive. I have respect! The next election will be half, thanks to your father. Your father was going from strength to strength. The sixth one is almost sold out. I'm ashamed of myself, but when I wrote that... When I wrote that book... Enough! The book manuscript never seemed to finish. As I was writing, I felt so bad I was crying! That's right. I cried as well. Really sad. Yes, Madam! Not a single person living in this country could resist tears reading it. Everyone in this country will be happy with me being elected to the House of Representatives in the National Diet. It's really an honor! I'm not good because I'm a member of the Communist Party, don't you get it? I won't say "workers" but you know, it spills from "the masses' living", if you catch that, your future will expand drastically. Very stable, right? Only you can do this. I don't think too bad of it. But just because I wasn't getting dumped for six months, doesn't mean I'll never be dumped again. - I haven't changed at all. - No no no, that's wrong. You're loved by France. What? What are you guys talking about? Very artistic! I was very impressed by your exhibition the other day. You draw things like a human but when drawing above the neck, you draw things like a ruler, a bucket, or money. I couldn't understand, but it was beautiful. I'm very sleepy... Let's dance. Huh, you're alone? Yeah, they went home by car. Went home by car? It made me think how politics is made from the public people. One day I was walking in Ginza. Ginza is a city where the rich walk around in Japan, you know Nevertheless, only some people wear luxury clothes. It's a bit flashy, but it's also modest. They are the public. I thought I was on their side. Your stories are all heart warming, sir. It was nice to meet you, but it's too small a thing. I'll give you a present. There is a girl in Akasaka that I'm raising. - I will introduce you to her. - Very good, sir. Hey, Gon-chan. GON! Thank you, oh sir, already going home? Yep! Please come again. I hope to read your new books too. - Thank you. - I'll be waiting for you. OK. Welcome! - Good evening. - Take a seat. Hello? This is Shibuya Shota Hospital. Yes. Orikabe? This is Orikabe. Oh, hey sis! It's been a long time since I last talked to you. It seems like we live so far apart. I haven't met you in so long it seems like you're calling from overseas. Because, every time I visit, you aren't home. Really? Are you at the store in Ginza right now? Because I can hear the music. Phonograph records? Me? I'm all right. Marriage? You got married? Oh, talking about me? There's no one like that. It's just noise, it sometimes gets loud. Do you need anything else? OK. Bye. OH! Wait. You know... Please call me from time to time. Good night. I'm home! I'm home. Huh, I'm hungry. Are these the only side dishes? - There's the last of the miso soup. - No, it's OK. I'll heat it up. What work do you have coming back home past 10 p.m. everyday? Only that bowl of Udon gets served after 8 p.m. - Banks manage those things quite well. - It hasn't heated up yet. It's OK. I don't want it boiling too much. Banks start closing at 3 p.m. right? Hey father, move the desk to face this way. It's bad for the eyes. It doesn't matter which way. Got it? Banks fully close at 5 p.m., and all the people go home before the sun sets. A young girl not coming home until late. What will happen if strange rumors start? It's because I have work to do! Bank management is really strict. People not working don't even get a bowl of Udon. Calculations must be correct to the finest, or you can't go home. - So everyone stays there? - Only two of us. Mogi-san of securities stays the latest everyday. I don't feel I can leave even a minute earlier. - It clears all my stresses. - How stubborn. - Not at all. - I know it, because I gave it to you. - What a weird name. - It's a good name. It isn't a common name. Oh god! Are you alright? Taxes suck up a lot, so my eyes have been flickering. Counting up other people's taxes sound so boring. You get home this late because you're counting other people's money right? I'd like to pay taxes for once just to feel it. Stop saying stupid stuff. If we got taxed, we wouldn't be able to manage. Finished eating. Hey, be careful. Noro-san got hit by a car. He died? - He sprained his right arm. - Is that all? How boring. - He'll hear. - It's OK. IDIOT! Be careful! Don't! He's just talking in his sleep. - Are you OK? - Idiot! You're hurt? - It doesn't hurt. - It did. - It didn't! - It did! It didn't! Teacher! Is that number inside the square root 5 or 6? We can't understand what you're writing! I injured my right arm. It'll get well soon so please forgive me. Teacher, I'll write for you. Thanks. Put 'E' on the extent of 'B' Put 'F' on the extent of 'C' 'BE = BA' Thank you, you saved me a lot of trouble. Teacher, $1 is enough. I used all my time just now, so I need to copy someone's notebook. And they take $0.50 to copy, and so... Actually, I'll make it $0.80 OK, the change... No, I don't need it. Thank you. Mr. Noro, please come with me for a bit. Uhh, to be honest, we will soon have a meeting. Kobata-san will come here. That sounds great. - You are friends? - No, I only know the name. OK, so.. Noro-san and Kobata-san, are both talented people. Excuse me but, we will be using you in this sector. But only using you there is a waste. So I'd like it if you could attend the night-school season too. Huh, but... This isn't a request, since there are many teachers wanting to join the precious school, so it's OK if you want to quit, because you couldn't find the time at night. And we wouldn't bear you a grudge. Uh, but... - OK, I'll take it. - Thank you. Be quiet! And I am actually thinking quite a bit. Even this room, I want to celebrate when the headmaster comes. Anyhow, there are numerous universities, but there are only a few great universities and high schools only grow in number. I would want to help students who couldn't get in with their first try. Hey, clean up! This year was really full, with one in two students not being able to attend. I also want to raise the teachers' salary. The night-school season has cheaper train fees, Properly speaking, we would have to lower your salary, or our calculation wouldn't match up. But we can't ask that nonsense. So I would want you to take both night and day. And so, when the others' salary raise, I would need to retain your salary. If we do that, we thought you would understand our feeling about you. That we want to protect you. OK, I understand. OK, so please take the classes from tonight. Huh? From today? Kobata-san isn't always free so when he's not available, you could take his place. Huh, OK. Is there a fight? FIGHT! Stop fighting! This guy! He spoke things that he shouldn't say. Talking is just talking, don't use your fists. - He rejects my thinking. - Of course. Boring.. let's go back. These days, there are many bad students. Your ages aren't too bad. I had a special experience. When I was in the army, the ammo ran out, the food ran out. Nobody understood what the war was for. Someone out of the blue, remembered it was 11th of February. I didn't think the birthday of our country was important. With a weak voice, they started singing, and my heart started to fill. There was some crying. I don't agree. That's a normal reaction. Normal for your age, teacher. This isn't a problem of age. Have you ever thought why Japan lost the war? But you are the one raising the question. I don't quite know. All countries are a bit dodgy at the beginning. But we can't get hung up on that. A people have a right to celebrate their nation. What is a country? Today, there are only workers and employers. You will feel bad saying that. I have a strong feeling that doesn't change. I like that. I was born as a farmer in Sizuoka. But because I was smart, I was sent here. And when I think of how hard my parent are working, I can't easily go back there. It's same for me too. I am wearing this great uniform, but at night, I'm working really hard. Is that so? It really makes me think. Teacher, come please. Can you buy a ration card from me? How much? I'll make it cheap, only 3 cards. - Two cards is OK. - Really? Will you be OK selling this? No, it's OK. Go ahead and get some food. Yeah. - I got this for you. - Thank you. Hey, the fee for socks, the other day. Now? You told me you'd give it after you got your salary. - Really? - Yes. OK. Now? OK, $0.50. I feel scammed. Only a bit. What? Car. - You got your car stolen? - No. - Got hit by one? - No. - Went past me. - Huh, went past you? - Can I rest for a bit? - Sure. There. Don't mind me. You should train your heart. You need a strong heart to live in Tokyo. If you are scared of everything, you can't live here. Strong, strong heart. Why are you shivering? What happened? I killed my little brother Oyama, it's a brother-killer. Please take him. OK. Give me the pistol. You used this and went BANG to him? OK, let's go. Yes, huh. Kuyama, the escaped killer has been captured. OK, got it. Please move a bit. Hmmm, thief, robber... oh this. I killed my son. I killed my son with mental illness. I don't know why. You need to calm down. Calming down is important. Oyama, please settle this person. Please, it's this way. Killers? Huh. Thank you, I'm much calmer now. Really? Come back again. Bye. What's up? I killed a mouse! Ah, eating? Being alone is hard isn't it. Wow, looks delicious. Really delicious! Did you use Niboshi? Yeah. Really? It's really great. Thanks. There's people in the neighborhood who are saying bad things about you. I told them that I didn't know a thing. Let's talk some more. I've still not got enough. No need to hurry. You're still young. Your wife who died, she must have been very beautiful. I don't remember, that was 8 years ago. 8 years.... My husband would get a new wife as soon as possible, I'm 100% certain. So I'm trying to live as long as possible. It's bad for my daughter too. Oh yeah, I'll show you. See this. She tried really hard to not take one. Very beautiful. It's not like that, it's just my parents trying. She's already 24. I wanted her to be married by now. Can I take this? Really? Do you have anyone in mind? Yea, Did they graduate university? Of course. - Do they live in Tokyo? - Yes. Wonderful! Where does he work? A teacher. A teacher? At a university? A university... the same level as university. How old is he? I think he is a little bit old, only a little. Age isn't a problem! Really? Of course not! Is he tall? About the same as me. Wonderful! - Hello? - Who is it? I'm too busy and can't talk properly with you. Please talk to that person about it, bye. What? No, I don't need it. OK... That dirty... - Mr. Noro? - Yes. Please sit here. - Have him take off his clothes. - Huh? Hurry. Please take off your clothes here. Hurry. You aren't exercising enough. Weak muscles. Any past sickness? - What? - Any past sickness? No. Full malnutrition. Japanese always lack nutrition. Don't just eat rice. Cheese, egg, liver. And meat. Also cabbage. Cabbage? Eat raw cabbage. Raw? You can make soup with it. Anyway, eat more of it. I didn't know I had any problem. You need to get an x-ray, but the x-ray here is broken, so come back some time later. Next! Mr. Yoshida? Can you check my arm? Arm? Yea, I sprained it. A doctor introduced me here. Ah, it was you? The introduction. This is only internal medicine. That doctor rushes many things. Oh no, is there any hospital near with external care? You sprained it? I'll do it. External or internal, they are just the face. There's not much difference. Oikabe, get it ready. And you... Where are the clinical records? I was just about to do it. When you think about doing it, just do it. OK. - Name? - Noro. Orikabe, prepare Mr. Noro's records and get the cure ready. Next! Oh you. There are still patients so excuse me, but I'll eat my lunch. I will say this straight, but I have a lung disease. Sorry. No, it's OK. I'm used to it. This summer, I wanted to get a part time job, but with this disease, I couldn't get it. Can you make a medical certificate that I don't have a lung disease? Actually, the other day, I asked the hospital head but he refused. But then, a nurse said to ask you. The head of hospital works on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Today is Tuesday, so I came to ask. How bad is the disease? I heard it's pretty bad. With a fake certificate, get a part time job. If all goes well, you could get an actual job. With an actual job, you could work for more. Even with a fever, you can work. But after getting the job for real, give them paper of absence on account of your illness, then you can get your salary too. It will be perfect if it goes like that. What will you do if you spread it? But, if a war starts, that won't even matter. Nothing would matter. Would there be any war? You want a certificate saying you are healthy? Thank you so much. I can only give you $5. I don't need it. Sorry. Where is your school? University of Tokyo. A Tokyo University student wants a part time job at a department store? The only hope is war. Thank you. That nurse told me. I thought that. She's beautiful. Anyone will think that at first. But I can't understand a single bit of what she's thinking. Being too perfect turns her unattractive. There being a girl like that nowadays feels weird. You going back home this early, is quite unusual. Yea, Mogi-san being absent is rare too. Mogi-san had a fever today. Even with that strong-looking body, you get ill. Yeah, I know. Huh? How about you? No. You really try till the end. I'm not like that. Huh, but they walk weirdly. Raise the leg like this, walk like a little bird. Don't mess with him. Why didn't you go on a date? I wanted to watch stripping, but he said he wanted to watch a movie. You couldn't agree? Not that like. He said he could watch a movie and eat ramen but not watch stripping. Of course! You should have gone. I don't like to compromise half way. Stubborn. I'm Kanko. Today's movies are Kinto-Ganda, .... - How big. - I'm amazed. - A chef? - No, you don't know? Ex-army colonel. - Solider? - No, a politician. He wrote a book about the army which sold great so he got kicked off. He turned into a full-time writer. Really? I'm really jealous of you. Teachers have great responsibilities. It's not that great. But if you're compared to us, who gets scared of newspaper articles... Is that even a bow? Put your head lower. He's the ex-army colonel I talked about. Really? He looked at us and bowed. Completely different from politicians after the war. Really amazing. Really, really amazing. He bowed to us! It's real. He's very well-mannered. Well-behaved! How great it feels! Noro-san, let's go for a drink somewhere. I'll pay for you. I've got these cards. What? I thought they might come into play some day so I got them. Oh yeah, I got hungry too. Feel free to eat anything. Really? Thank you. Delicious! Yeah. Is it OK eating now? Will you still be able to eat dinner? It's fine. Dinner is dinner. But eating with the crowd is really delicious. I want to eat with you, but my family gets noisy about it. Not too much. When you get annoyed, just eat somewhere else for like a month. Eating somewhere else is very handy, but the taste is too much, so you get bored really fast. So eating at home, and sometimes eating out is perfect. You think so? But buying cards for eating out. Huh, you can easily buy them. Yeah, it is should be really easy, since the system would get clogged without it. Do you know Goku-san's house? The upper part of Sakuraga-oka right? - It's almost complete? - Yeah, only a few days left. I met Goku-san there. He bowed to us. Have you ever met him? Nope. He's really great. - This is... - I'm Koga Jiro. I'm Kanamori. He was really musclier, as an ex-solider. The people are just ignoring the new manner laws. I agree too. Face us and politely, say Konnbanwa Oh, good evening. - What would you like? - What do you have? Its all written there. - What's the most delicious? - Hey, stop. Rice and miso-soup for two. I can't continue the situation right now anymore. - Then what do I have to do? - Fight for it of course! I don't disagree. I don't know why such a great person with strong beliefs won't join us. You are a coward. Can you tell them to talk more quietly? Weren't you saying the opposite a bit ago? I once though that. There is a thing called order in the word, so listen to me. I understand what your belief is and I don't care what your belief is. But what does it mean that your belief completely changes in not even a week? Have you ever thought deeply? Noro-san, it will get cold. But it's a big problem. Society is drastically changing. Nothing is possible nowadays. He doesn't understand that giving up on things is also important. That's why he needs to do it messily. Yeah. I have thought deeply. I have just thought deeply. After thinking deeply, I will say that my belief now will never change, teacher. - Teacher? - Oh, you are the police officer. Police officer? My wife really wanted to meet you again. You are police? Talking like that? Aren't you embarrassed talking like that? You wanna do this? Hey! Hey, stop. How dare you! Fighting over a small thing, its just like the country right now. It was boring. Really? Oh yeah, it was. Watching a movie and eating ramen would have been better. Let's go eat ramen. I feel bad. I got you to go to the strip show with me, and now you'll pay for the ramen too? No, if you hadn't invited me, I'd never have had a chance to go somewhere like this. If I don't go to Ginza sometimes, I'll be old-fashioned. OK, let's go. With a person like you Noro-san, it feels great. Young men are stubborn, same as me, so I easily get in a fight with them. Kanko-san, you aren't as stubborn as you think you are. Basically they don't have confidence as a man. If people get old like you, life will be stable, and their feelings will free up, right? At my school, it's like I'm doing it all by myself. The manager knows that too, and thinks about me a lot. But I don't plan to stay at a school like that forever. If they ask, I can't deny the request too. How long are you going to stay in our house? I'm making quite some contracts. There are also people worrying about me too. I'm thinking of building a small house. I'm just working hard and focusing to make that possible. Sounds great. Building a house? Some day in the future. This flower is beautiful. Please give me this. Hello? Please don't do it here. Oh, it's you. - Going home now? - Yeah. It's tough, you know. It still gets super cold at night. Let's go that way. The moon is great. Please take this. - What is it? - Just a newspaper. Oh really? Thanks. Teacher, you are being used too. You said you'd work nights, but were only there twice. You work both day and night but only get paid for day right? It's better than getting fired. That is the bad part of capitalism. How dark society is. But sir, we're almost there. Let's fight together. Tomorrow, there will be a big student protest. But I'm not a student. Those protest are better with more people. I don't know what to do, please help me. What happened to your friend? He ran away. He is scared of being told by me. He is a coward. I agree. I really agree. Right? Yeah. But if the school knew you'd join, wouldn't that be a problem? They said they'd just walk. I'm going there as a school trip. I might go too, if the weather is nice. Move out of the way! I'm sorry we had to change rooms so much. This is the first time we've captured this many people. Hey Gon! Get the bag. Hold it well! Your friend was pulled by the police for evidence. Who was that you were just with? I don't know. Age, name, address and your family. Say it. You are a student, right? Not that far right? Just say it! He said he certainly saw the boy going in this room! Mom! Ah! Sanpei! Who's done such a thing to you? Mommy! I want to go home. Tokyo is scary! Everywhere is the same.... I will be a farmer! You may be alright, but how about us, the school? Please think about us too. What will happen if you leave us right now? The students are idiots and happy not having classes, but the police won't be. We can't find useful teachers like you in one or two days. I admit I take full responsibility. I had too light a feeling. I won't do such a thing anymore. So one thing. Idiot! You can't do anything like this anymore. You are fine, you can just leave the job. The problem is training the teachers. How will you take responsibility for the classes we built? - I'm very sorry. - Apologizing changes nothing. If you were working properly, you'd have got severance pay. You won't get any salary for this month either. That is a matter of course. Thanks for your help at length. Oh, Noro-kun. Ah, sir. What happened to you? I didn't recognize you. I slipped a bit. I wanted to see you. I was just going to visit you tomorrow. To my house? I need a favor. Tomorrow isn't Sunday so I was worried. What? Sunday doesn't matter to me anymore. The people at my job sucked. They don't have any manners. You quit? I grew that company. Now that I left the company, nobody is left there to continue and grow it. Somebody did some dirty work, so I decided quit. They were sweating so much, they tried to stop me, but it was too late. I wouldn't have retrieved the resignation-letter. Really? I won't be working for a while. But it can't be helped. I'll give you one of these. It's a toy but it's well made. Sorry. I'm planning to open a farm. My neighbor was making $500 a month with 1,000 chickens and 20 goats. I can make $700 a month. And you? A school teacher, right? Yes. That school, I can feel for you. But having a job is a great thing! A great thing. You want to meet someone? No, lunch, I'm a graduate of class Showa 11. A job at a clock store. No experience needed. Five people. Starting salary $1.50. Be quiet! Don't push! No need of age. - They said nothing about age. - You wouldn't be able to work there. They will be making bullets. That's my profession! I was working in a military factory during the war. Me too! Oh, why did it break now? Hey, what happened? This is an announcement. The film display broke and we don't know when it will be fixed. Please wait patiently. I'll wait until it gets fixed. Me too. Nothing should be broken. Hey, what about resting for a bit? Yes. Let's eat the daifuku. You said after Kanko gets home. It's OK. Just leave one for her. Call Noro-san. What is he thinking of? Losing a job right now. He has to pay us the rent. You don't understand the feeling of losing a job as a man. Not having a job is a sad thing. Yes. Hello. Noro-san. Ah, hi. Do you want to join us? Thank you very much. Thanks. Take a seat! You're busy every night with your work! How about you get some help from Noro-san, since he's just loafing around? Huh you, you always say stuff like that. Are you alright? It's my left arm this time. The other day, there was a funny incident at the office. Was it that boring? What are you saying? The city's office work is very complicated. Every time after a system changes, even people like me who've worked for years aren't used to it. A guy joined the department of property tax last year. The department of property tax is really complicated and so at reception, there are always people who make complaints every day. And we have to listen to every single one of them and calculate everything again. But the person doesn't understand and so this man, the prime minister, changed a law going through the National Diet. The Ministry of Finance got this job and divided each division. And our office, has to say how it's correct, over 100 times each day. And after repeating that, he finally lost his mind. Huh. I was very surprised when that happened. Suddenly, he lifted his hands and started laughing. Disgusting. He is in the hospital right now. After seeing people's faces, he says "You are an idiot". That's scary. Yes, it is. Kanko-san is late. Yes, she is. How was it? The woman the other day? Oh, yes, good. I'll eat now. They lost their job. Oh, too bad. I'm home. Sorry for making you wait. What happened to the other doctor? He only comes on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. No, the other young doctor. Dr. Tezuka quit. Quit? He said how he didn't want to be in this hospital with bad care even a day longer. But, in fact... he was fired. Oh, what are you up to? - Sorry. - Sorry? Nothing to apologize for. We're not connected any more. Hey! Get that work done faster! Could you maybe think about it again? It's OK even if its elementary or middle school. You said there weren't enough teachers but... Of course, what you did is in the papers wherever you go. Who would ever want to hire a teacher who likes fighting? I'm not that kind of person. What? You punched someone in the park. Even with a reason, punching is bad. I don't want to, not even if I'm asked to. It's scary like war. Stop being sarcastic. War isn't something small like that. I don't care how low the salary is. I'll teach by myself throughout the day. I'll work my socks off. So you want me to fire all the other teachers? Go home now. I didn't want to say this but... Can I have my month's salary? What are you saying? We decided we couldn't raise your salary. If this was a normal workplace, I'd be looked after for resigning even back then. I have been working in this school for over a year. Hey, are you trying to blackmail me? Blackmailing me? If you want to say anything say it and leave! Sorry, I'll apologize. Please give me my month's salary, I don't care how much it is, please! Idiot! Noro-san, you still have $0.20, what do you want to do with it? Can't I move it? It will take about a week. Sure. It will better for us if you didn't. Really? What are you going to do then? Good evening. Sorry for helping him. I'm playing around anyway so it's an honor to be able to help. He says his eyes have been flickering for some time now, so I was a bit worried. How is he? He is sleeping, snoring loudly. It's not too bad. He told about the man who lost his mind. Gave me the creeps. If there is anything I can help with, please tell me. Really? I don't really want to say this to you who don't have a job, but he will get better soon, and there's the medical fee so... Could you pay the rent for this month? Of course. No, it doesn't have to be right now. Really? Thank you. Kanko isn't coming home even though he is sick. Hey Noro-san, how do you feel about Kanko? She's always late, does she have a man? She said she is working hard since Mogi-san works hard too, but I think it's something to do with that person. Can you go to the bank and check on her? This is for the train. It's the round-trip fare. I trust Kanko but she is still young and it's a parent's responsibility. She was there. Do you want to call her? No, its OK. I'll wait until she finishes work. Really? Mom, what's up? You seem happy. Of course! My daughter works really hard till late! - Is dad alright? - There's no need to worry. He's old enough. I need to get better. What a surprise, I was about to go home and there's Noro-san. - Really? - He is strange, you know. He's a good person. What about taking a room rent fee from him? $20 is the going rate for 4 mats, so with 6 mats, we can take $30. No we can't, dad is management. If the neighbors knew he was taking money from Noro-san, there'd be ugly rumors. It's makes no difference. We need the money. I was giving it a lot of thought too. Mom, I've been thinking of saying this. I have someone I want to marry, he works at the same bank. Is it Mogi-san? Mogi-san is a woman. He's called Uwazin. But what does he think? His mind is made up. That sounds great. What kind of person is he? He's just a normal worker and his salary is the same as mine. I don't mind working together at the start. I really think he'll be promoted. How old is he? He's young. 26. He works really hard. He starting working at the bank 10 years ago and has continued from there. He only went to middle school. It's his personality. That's not good. I disagree with this marriage. Why? Why, please? Think about me too. With dad's small salary, raising kids was really hard! And when Keichi was about to enter university, he goes to war and dies there. So I want you, just you to be with someone who graduated university. - Who cares about academics? - No, it matters. I had a hard time because dad only graduated middle school. Yes, but he raised two kids. Now there are unions and it's easy to get a salary raise. But it wasn't like that. You know I worked hard too. Even I graduated supplementary school. If I had been with someone better, it could have been easier. My bank's foreign department boss only graduated middle school, but he can fluently speak English, French, Spanish and Chinese. It was all self-study. Many graduates are boring like Noro-san. Even if they're boring, they still take shape. If Noro-san hadn't graduated university, he would already be broke. He graduated, and he pays the rent. He has no other place so, when I casually mentioned it earlier, he paid up right away. He probably has lots of savings. - So I should go with Noro-san? - Don't be so stupid. You don't know how much graduates brag, mostly about being rich. So you're making fun of me? Making fun of your parents? I'm saying it's your weird way of raising kids. I don't care anymore I don't care who or where or when you marry. Why do you say such a thing? Please understand. No, I can't. - Please understand! - I can't! Why can't you? It's you, you! Let's go. You will never lose $1,000,000 with this. The deadline is the day after tomorrow. Oh, Arata. Oh, teacher. What are you doing here? What are you doing? As you can see, part time job, or more like a full time job Furuhashi was worrying about you. He's an idiot, I'm not going to school anymore so... You left too? Too? You got fired? Who cares about that stupid school? What are you doing right now? Huh, nothing much. Hey! I'll go later. No, I don't care. Yes, I promise! There's an idiot in my house. If he tried for 3 more years, I wouldn't have to be doing this. What about a card? I didn't bring my wallet. OK, I'll give it you. It won't be the jackpot. Which do you want? Oh, hi. Cabbage. I found one! A workplace. It's not just 'huh', get ready right now, I ran home. I'm out of breath. When I was talking, it came to that topic. And so... Nihon-bashi 3-1, something building... Go and get ready! Delivery job for the Sister Sewing Machine Company. You use your head. Sewing machine companies nowadays make bullets for machine guns. The one we often see at the park, right? The woman was so boring but now she's wife of the company president. Meeting her and getting to the topic of hiring, you should feel lucky. I have something to give you. Just wait a bit. Where was it? If Noro-san gets in the company, it would be great for when dad gets into trouble like the other day. I can increase the room fee. Noro-san, please get ready quickly! I said I'd guarantee a person, and she said must would be before 5 p.m.. It's already three! Huh? Nihon-bashi 3-1. Nihon-bashi 3-1. OK, I'll go now. Thank you for all of this. NORO-SAN, WAIT! Dad, Mom, farewell. Please forgive my feeling for dying ahead of you. I'll never forget how you showed me the way with kindness despite my stubbornness. Even after I die. For now, I will just say goodbye. Oh no, how terrible. What should we do? She doesn't have to die, even if she felt so cornered. I wouldn't have disagreed with her. Even if they only graduated middle school. She isn't dying. Kanko-san won't die. Not this easily. No, she'll die! If she decides to die, she will! No, its OK! Noro-san, please find her! Please find her What if she really died? Please go find her! Call the police, that's the fastest way. Police? Are you stupid? Why won't you go find her? Because we should hurry. And I have to hurry too. A person is about to die, who even cares about a job? I found it for you! Then call your husband! Getting him back would be the fastest. I could call you on the way, I still have time that way. You'll leave me? Why are you going to leave me? Noro-san you are a worthless person! - Calling your husband would be best! - HEY! IDIOT! WORTHLESS! Huh? A lion ran away? This isn't a zoo. Don't mess with us. Hello? Hello? Hello? Huh? Neck? What's the problem? An old man hanging? And where is it? Oh, that place? OK! A young woman? Poison suicide? Is she beautiful? Beautiful? Where is it? Yotsuya, Iemon inn? OK. Really beautiful! Yes, still alive. Alive? Stop just staring and start working! When are the police coming? It's only packing. Now its empty, huh. I'm hungry. How about a drink? Sounds great! But the price is kind of high Is it? $10 for training and 39 people at a place I heard there were 320 people trying to get in. But they are all naked. Naked? The guy from president's wife, huh. I can't do anything with him. I've done it! Do it faster! I was about to die. I won't forgive you for disturbing me. Miss, please just tell us your name and address. No, I won't. We'll be in trouble. What if I was already dead? Asking just because I'm alive is unfair. It's the same as if I'm dead. Go ahead and do your experiments. Don't bully us so much. Please tell us, so we can help. OK, I will, so give me some tablets, ones I can die with. What should we do? What she says is understandable. Let her die. She's really cornered. Don't be an idiot. Us police have to... You took medicine every day, right? My wife died of stomach cancer so... - I might get it too. - Do you have the medicine? Yes, of course. - Let her drink this! - Her? That's a great idea! Don't be an idiot. Us police have to... Shut up! OK, let's give it to her! Thank you everyone. I had a young love. My mom didn't approve of my marriage because he didn't have a great academic background. I was going to marry either way. But my loved one said to wait for my parents' approval. I'm not a person who changes their mind half way through. Every single person has left me. And so I decided. I am about to die. I don't hate anyone anymore. My loved one and my mother, I can forgive them gratefully. So now, farewell. Your address and name please. Tokyo, Shibuya, Sakuragaoka 1-2-3-4, Kanamori Fukichi's first child Kanko. Noisy.. Welcome! - This is a hyacinth? - Yes. I'll buy one. Should I wrap it? - How much is it? - This is cheap. $1.20. Maybe some other time. I'll lend you some. Good evening. Good evening. Which one? Ah, the hyacinth? How beautiful! $1.20? It's too bad for me. I'll give you all I have right now. Anytime is fine. The other $0.60, I'll pay you within 20 days. I don't care, it's just $0.60. Thanks for buying! Goodbye. Thanks. I just got back. Excuse me. Welcome home. Is Kanko-san alright? Yes, there was news just now. My wife flew out. Did she die? They said attempted suicide, so I think there is still hope. Oh, really. Really. My wife told me to go with her, but I was too scared to go. Parents are strange. How about you? Thanks to you, I got hired. - Oh really, that's good to hear. - It's only temporary. They said it's not for long. I must thank you again sometime later. No, you don't have to. - Oh, temporary. - They said machine gun. Machine gun? It's only packing so I think the crime is light. Light baggage? It's an early-morning job, I have to be there by seven. The boss wakes up very earlier. I'll go to sleep now. Go ahead, I'll wait a bit longer. OK, good night.
