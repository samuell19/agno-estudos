Stupid idiot. "Stupid idiot..." ﻿Who do you want to be with, Rikki? - I don't care. ﻿Well? ﻿I'll be with Michael. ﻿What do we have to do? - It's like this, ﻿everyone tells his partner a story that happened to him. Okay? ﻿You'll choose one story and then tell us that story. ﻿We'll have to guess who the story really happened to. ﻿Got it? ﻿What story? ﻿I don't get it. ﻿What am I supposed to say? ﻿I'll be with you. ﻿Just look at the camera. ﻿A few months ago I stole my brother's ID. ﻿I needed money so I went to donate sperm. ﻿At 15 you can't donate sperm? ﻿It's just a story, stupid. Forget it... ﻿Let Michael tell. ﻿Rikki, finish the story. ﻿Then tell them not to laugh. - They aren't laughing at you, ﻿finish your story, then well hear from Michael. ﻿My big brother Amit is 22 and he's done it a few times. ﻿I needed... ﻿What an ass. ﻿You're gonna get it, I swear. ﻿Just you wait. ﻿My big brother Amit is 22 and he's done it a few times. ﻿I needed the money and since we look alike I pretended to be him. ﻿I went, had a few tests, and donated. ﻿Rikki! Rikki! Rikki! ﻿Very good, Rikki. ﻿Your turn, Michael. - Don't want to. ﻿See, Rina? You're such an Arab... ﻿You're gonna get it. - Sure you don't want to? ﻿Rina, I did it, so should he. ﻿Why isn't he... ﻿We'll do it. - Die, you piece of shit. ﻿I was arrested last summer... ﻿I can't fall asleep at night, I get bored. ﻿I met a girl and got her to come over. ﻿I was drunk. ﻿I drove her on Elad's scooter. ﻿I ran a red light and only stopped in the middle of the intersection. ﻿That crazy bitch went ballistic on me and ran away. ﻿The judge made me do community service for drunk driving. ﻿Eden! ﻿You interrupt everyone, you jerk. ﻿I just don't get it. ﻿Okay, let's calm down. ﻿I was arrested half a year ago. - This is obviously Eden's story. ﻿Enough, Daniel. - "Daniel" again? ﻿Move your arm. ﻿I can't fall asleep at night so I go on jitney rides. ﻿The 5 line from the bus station to north Tel Aviv, ﻿back and forth, all night. ﻿Of all the people that got on and off, there was a tourist who caught my eye. ﻿Do you want to leave? Do you? ﻿I've never seen such a retard. - Then stop it! ﻿You're bothering everyone. ﻿Shh... ﻿Count to three and calm down. ﻿Why to three and not ten? - Don't encourage him. ﻿Anyway, there was a tourist who caught my eye, so... ﻿I took her to my place and after two shots she went down on me. ﻿You mean "blew me. - It's the same thing. ﻿This is boring. You said we'd make movies. ﻿What kind of movies do you want to make? - Like on the Viva Channel. ﻿Viva la diva ﻿Viva Victoria ﻿Aphrodite... ﻿Like on the Viva Channel? - A comedy. ﻿A comedy, something funny. ﻿They also have those movies with Indians... -Indians? ﻿Those with the hat... - Horror!

Ilya, don't start in... ﻿Stop it! Cut it out! ﻿Please stop it! Please stop! ﻿Leave him alone! I'm begging you. ﻿Stop it, Ilya! ﻿Leave him alone! ﻿Please stop it! ﻿I'm begging you, leave him alone! ﻿When we lived in the Ukraine we lived near the airport. ﻿Every time a plane flew over ﻿the whole house shook. ﻿When my mom brought a man home I'd go up on the roof. ﻿I liked to imagine I was catching a plane and flying away. ﻿Rina. ﻿Can you sign this? ﻿Is the train station on your way? ﻿No, but I'll give you a ride. ﻿Eden... ﻿Leave him alone! ﻿It's okay, he's with me. ﻿Eden! ﻿Calm down. ﻿I'll be right back. ﻿Is Eden here? ﻿One floor up. ﻿Is Eden here? ﻿He's not home. Who are you? ﻿I teach him filmmaking. ﻿Eden's learning filmmaking? ﻿I know he's under house arrest. He must be here. ﻿Someone stole my wallet. ﻿I can lend you a few shekels. - And my phone. ﻿What phone? ﻿Someone stole my phone. ﻿If she wasn't here now I'd kick your ass. ﻿You're blaming me? -Eden! ﻿Thanks to you I'm gonna get another month of house arrest. ﻿How is it my fault? ﻿Can you call him? - He says it isn't him. ﻿Then who is it? He bumped into me when Rina chased him. ﻿Eden may be many things, but he's not a liar. ﻿I have no way to get back to Tel Aviv. ﻿Can you please call him? I need to talk to him. ﻿Wait a second. ﻿He says if you leave the camera ﻿as collateral he'll loan you some money. ﻿Rina, how long do we have to wait for that prick? -Elad. ﻿Director my ass. He can direct my dick. ﻿Don't "fff" him, ﻿he has an annoying voice. ﻿I have an annoying voice? - Let's go, guys. ﻿Sorry. I owe you ten minutes at the end of class. ﻿You don't have to. - Rikki... ﻿Class ends exactly on the half-hour. ﻿Class ends when I say it ends. ﻿You're out. ﻿Whoa... ﻿Eden can't stay. ﻿Someone stole my wallet and my phone. ﻿Eden... - How do you know it was him? ﻿Fine, it wasn't him. He can go home. - I can't go home. ﻿Did you steal his wallet? - Who stole his wallet? ﻿Quiet. Quiet. ﻿It's not him. ﻿Did you see him? - When you chased him and he hid behind me. ﻿You actually saw him? ﻿Class is over. You can go now. ﻿Stop, stop, stop. ﻿Stop! Back in your places. ﻿Right now! ﻿Violation of community service means prison time. ﻿You need us, we don't need you. They won't be writers. ﻿I will. - Good luck. And you get up and leave. Not another word. Up! ﻿Poor guy, he hasn't been out of the house in 6 months. ﻿He'll be stuck at home for a year. ﻿You want to join him? ﻿Nobody's keeping you here. - Who do you think you are? ﻿Who do I think I am? - Yeah, you think you're hot shot. ﻿What a dick. -Daniel... - Don't "Daniel" me. ﻿Not with your mouth. - Dickhead. ﻿I'll tell you my plans for our time together. ﻿You can't be here until I get my camera back. ﻿Well deal with the camera later. - No. ﻿Tell him to go. ﻿It doesn't work that way. ﻿Come here, Eden. ﻿Eden. ﻿It's not fair, Rina, let him stay. You know how difficult it is for him. ﻿Are you finished now? ﻿As I said, I'll tell you my plans for our time together. ﻿How's it going? ﻿Okay. Are you around? ﻿Where else would I be? ﻿Come on, coffee? ﻿I'll drop off the filmmaker and come by. ﻿What filmmaker? - Never mind. What's up? ﻿Wait, listen. One of your kids, Eden, has been at the marketplace for two hours. ﻿Looking fortrouble? You want another four months? ﻿They take off the ankle bracelet in two weeks. ﻿Get in, I'll take you home. ﻿I'm not gonna chase you. If you don't get in now, it's all over. ﻿Our charming Bar Mitzvah boy Assi has the floor. ﻿I want to thank you for coming to celebrate my Bar Mitzvah with me today. ﻿I want to thank my mom for putting this event together for me. ﻿To all my friends who came to celebrate with me I hope you enjoy it. Good evening. ﻿I never feel like I belong. ﻿I'm never there. I'm always halfway outside. ﻿So I learned to be alone, I learned to survive. ﻿I learned to feel alone, to play alone. ﻿It's much easier for me to be alone. ﻿I wake up when I want to and go back to sleep when I want to. ﻿How does this work? - I don't know. ﻿Bastard. - Stop it. ﻿You know what this is, don't you? ﻿A camera. - Right. ﻿These cameras are yours. ﻿You can film yourselves at home, ﻿at work, wherever. - How boring. I don't get it. ﻿When you get home, turn on the camera, talk to it, ﻿tell it about your day. - What if was a shitty day? ﻿Perfect. Tell it you had a shitty day. ﻿Then you better give us each at least ten cassettes. ﻿Can someone tell Eden? ﻿Eden won't want to. ﻿Shut up. What happens after I film myself? ﻿Don't tell me to shut up, Rikki. - Stop it, Daniel. ﻿Who does she think she is? - Shut up, let Assi talk. ﻿Can you tell Eden? ﻿Yeah, I'll ask him. - Okay. ﻿You'll each use the video you shoot to make a film that tells a personal story. ﻿Yes, Daniel? ﻿Don't feel like it. ﻿Can we do it together? - Yeah, I'll be the star. ﻿But then it won't be personal. - So what? ﻿I'm the leading star. ﻿We get it, you are all stars together. - Watch your mouth. ﻿I don't want to see your ugly ass. - Chill, Mr. Holy Man. ﻿Get out of my face. - Another hot shit. ﻿If he thinks he's hot shit, then for him you don't exist, don't worry about it. ﻿It's not what he said. Who's worrying? Little prick. ﻿How can anybody miss her? ﻿So now you want to see me? Make your mind up, blind jerk. ﻿Just because you feel her, it doesn't mean she exists. ﻿Rikki, you don't really exist. - Look who woke up. ﻿As I see it, only my existence is certain. The rest is in doubt. ﻿The object is questionable. Rikki is questionable. ﻿You're questionable. You must be crazy. - It's true. ﻿To you, I'm questionable. Why? ﻿Because your senses can fool you. ﻿What are you sensing? ﻿You know what senses are? - Don't patronize me. ﻿I'm not. You know what senses are? ﻿Perceptions. -That's right. ﻿Oh, really? -Yeah, really. ﻿In each of us is a demon. That demon can... fool our senses. ﻿That's why an object can be in doubt. Maybe Rikki isn't Rikki at all. You aren't you. ﻿I'm me, and there's nobody like me, babe. ﻿I don't get it. -Great, Rikki. - What don't you get? ﻿My mom is turning me into a Clonex zombie. ﻿She doesn't think I know she's spiking my corn fritters with it. ﻿She never even boiled an egg ﻿and suddenly I can't live without breakfast. ﻿She drugs me so I won't bother her ﻿and her stupid husband. ﻿Want to hear something? ﻿"In the springtime of youth a butterfly sprang forth and flew off into the skies of blue. ﻿"With each flutter, it went deep, probed deliberated and drew conclusions. ﻿"Detached from reality and need when it fluttered its soft wings." ﻿What was its conclusion? - That it wanted to see you sometime. ﻿I told you, Assi... ﻿it was fun, but I'm not interested. ﻿Neither am I. ﻿How about this afternoon? ﻿Oh, no, I'm volunteering this afternoon. ﻿Volunteering? Doing what? ﻿I work with kids with disabilities. ﻿Autism? ﻿Yeah, something like that. ﻿Okay. ﻿48.80. ﻿It's for the horse... ﻿Why's it so dark in here? - What are you doing? ﻿Turn off the light. ﻿Rikki, please don't be late again. ﻿What a day. I shouldn't have come. ﻿Just sit down. - Shut up. ﻿All that just to buy a horse? - Of course, stupid. ﻿It's what they always wanted. ﻿Would you shine shoes for a horse? - No, but for something else I would. ﻿Don't we collect bottles? - That's not the same, honey. ﻿I don't get it. Why'd they cheat the old lady? ﻿For money to buy the horse, didn't you get it? ﻿No, I thought they were just being assholes. ﻿What would you do if you were them? - I'd steal for sure. ﻿But then you'd end up in juvie. No horse, no nothing. ﻿What would you do, Re'em? ﻿I'd earn the money for the horse, ﻿but not by shining shoes like those retards. ﻿They shine shoes and still go to juvie. What was the point? ﻿You didn't get the movie. - As if you did. ﻿It's not whether they get the horse, it's what they'd do to get it. ﻿Nobody gives a damn about them. Let's watch the end, Assi. ﻿I had a good friend who... ﻿We were close. We went out drinking together. ﻿Sometimes we'd go to the train tracks ﻿and play "chicken". ﻿Just before the train came we'd jump off. ﻿Until it finally happened... ﻿His mom still blames me. ﻿Hi. - Did I steal your wallet again? ﻿Be nice, Eden. ﻿Hi.-Hi. - Want to come in? ﻿Come on in. ﻿Welcome. ﻿Assi! My man! ﻿Have a seat, bro. ﻿If longing breaks your heart ﻿If you dream without care ﻿Forget your pride ﻿Be happy in love ﻿Don't play with love ﻿It changes the whole world ﻿It knows no limits or what it means to compromise ﻿Forget your pride ﻿Be happy in love ﻿Don't play with love... ﻿I've been thinking... ﻿You can rejoin the group. ﻿Eden. ﻿You guys, congratulations to Eden, on his release from house arrest. ﻿To Eden! ﻿How could you fool around with love? ﻿You'll get buzzed faster with a straw. ﻿It gave you all the beauty in the world ﻿How could you fool around with love?

It's worthless. ﻿That's why I came. ﻿It's a present. ﻿I don't need it. ﻿Everyone got cameras. ﻿It bores me. ﻿I really want you to come back. ﻿I don't have to go any more. So I don't know ﻿Come on, I'll get you a lotto card. ﻿Assi... ﻿G'night, babe. Good luck. - Thanks. -Bye. ﻿What's up, Eden? ﻿What? ﻿You two step back. ﻿Here. - Got any ID? ﻿Yaniv, are you kidding?

He's a teacher. ﻿You marked Germany. - We know.' ﻿How much will they win? - 1,985.' ﻿Go to the back and bring me some empties and well split the cash? -Sure. ﻿But you told your mom you'd be right back. ﻿Fine, back in half an hour. ﻿You just got off house arrest. ﻿Half an hour and we're back. I'm going with him. ﻿Where do I dump them? - Plastic, glass, cans. ﻿Finished, Dima. - Try a little harder next time. Here. ﻿Are you saying we didn't try? ﻿Get outta here. ﻿Is that all you pay? ﻿I told him to bring more bottles. ﻿Go on, go to bed. ﻿That's not fair. ﻿Who are you? ﻿Then butt out. Now get lost. ﻿Give us what we have corning. - Move it. ﻿Empty your pockets. ﻿I said move it. - Okay, okay. ﻿Trash. I'll fuck you up. -It's okay. - Now fuck off. -Let's go.

Whaddaya want? - I want my daughter to go to sleep. ﻿Shalom, we're being quiet now. - I don't mind you sitting here drinking ﻿but we have to work tomorrow. ﻿We're working stiffs. ﻿You're right, man. We'll be quiet. Here, want a drink? ﻿No. ﻿No? ﻿I don't drink at night. ﻿Give him a Coke. Want a Coke? ﻿Hey... ﻿It was an accident. ﻿Everything okay? ﻿Everything's great. Want some cake? - Someone complained about noise. ﻿That was my wife. ﻿You have ten minutes to pack it in. ﻿Why not now? ﻿They have until 11:00. ﻿I'll come back then and I don't want to see you here. ﻿Tell him to stop riding his scooter, we can't sleep. ﻿Whose scooter is it? ﻿You wanna get hurt, huh? ﻿It's mine, motherfucker! - I was driving. ﻿I was driving the scooter.

David-EI, ﻿wake up, you're the lead actor. ﻿Naor sends his brother Assi ﻿to threaten David-EI. ﻿The confrontation gets out of hand and David-EI stabs Assi in the liver. ﻿Eden, where do you come up with these stories? ﻿Eden, hands down I love it. - Not fair. Either one of the gang is a girl ﻿or Naor's brother has a girlfriend, but I want a part. ﻿Somebody write her a part. - Hey, I want a part, too. -Mom... ﻿Don't start with me, Naor. ﻿As far as I'm concerned, Rikki, you're an object, ﻿only my existence is real. ﻿And Rikki, fuck off, you mean nothing in my existence. ﻿Did you leard how to talk? - Right, Assi? Who's the man? ﻿I didn't say that Rikki doesn't exist, I said that for me, only I exist, and Rikki... ﻿and the object is in doubt. - Rikki's an object? ﻿As if you know what an object is. ﻿Of course he knows. ﻿When you sleep, do you dream? ﻿Don't you dream? Everyone dreams. - We dream. Go on. ﻿And you feel like it's real, don't you? ﻿So what if all this isn't real? It may just be a dream. ﻿So all this could just be a dream? ﻿Could be. ﻿I'm trying to say that the sense of reality exists even in our dreams. ﻿That's why it's doubtful. - I get it. You can't tell until you wake up, ﻿I mean, you don't know if it's just a dream until you wake up. ﻿I wish it was just a dream. - If this is a dream, in reality I'm a soccer player. ﻿I know I'm really Messi. ﻿I'm inviting everyone to Thailand for a week of partying, big-time. ﻿Corning, Alma? - Me?

What did you do? ﻿I took someone on a motorcycle and she got hurt. ﻿She wasn't killed. - No. ﻿Your wife? ﻿I don't even know her name. - Oh. ﻿As long as you're okay. ﻿So what do you do? ﻿I'm a film director. -Oh. ﻿Do you really make movies? ﻿Yeah. ﻿I made one movie about my experiences in the army. ﻿Nice. - Yeah, and I'm doing a lot of writing now... ﻿What do you do? - What do you think? ﻿You're a chef. ﻿I take care of the elderly. ﻿At a nursing home? - No, through Social Security. ﻿When they need a cleaning lad/ they send me. I love movies. ﻿Eden... ﻿Vodka? Now? ﻿Huh? Just a little. ﻿What do think of his idea? ﻿All I got was that you're Naor's brother and you get stabbed in the liver. ﻿One Passover night, in the middle of the Seder, ﻿I ran away from home and slept with Daniel on the bridge. ﻿In the middle of the Seder are the plagues, blood, frogs and so on, ﻿where you pour wine into a box, ﻿so my uncles added Arafat, Saddam Hussein and Rabin, ﻿and I said Ruthie - she's my mom. ﻿My uncle dumped the wine on me and I ran out the door. ﻿I went to get Daniel so I wouldn't have to sleep alone. ﻿I stank of wine and we couldn't sleep so we threw rocks off the bridge. ﻿Honestly, we didn't mean to hit the cars, we meant to hit between the cars ﻿but one rock hit a car. ﻿The car flipped over and there was lots of blood and tears. ﻿I'll never forget it. Good thing nobody died. ﻿Those kids... ﻿Let me help you. - No, it's okay. ﻿If you want to help, stay out of the way. ﻿Are you sure? - Yeah. Just throw that out and leave it. ﻿All right. ﻿Ow. -Oh, no... ﻿I'm okay. -Are you sure? - I'm fine. ﻿Your shirt is ruined. ﻿I'll get you one of Eden's. ﻿Here, change into this. ﻿Go walk around for half an hour, okay? You're in my way. ﻿Where? - I don't know. Get me some bleach, okay? ﻿You know what to get, right? - Bleach. ﻿Here, take. ﻿From the charity box? ﻿I always take from it and pay back with interest. ﻿That's plenty... ﻿There's a clean towel in the bathroom. ﻿Eden! ﻿Let him sleep!

You're happier, calmer. Not the Eden I know. ﻿Does she expect me to be sad? ﻿They let me off house arrest. - If he's like this when he's calm, ﻿what's he like when he's upset? - I don't know, but it worries me. ﻿Don't worry, I'm not that happy. ﻿I didn't say I don't want you to be happy. ﻿I just said that if you have sex, ﻿please use birth control, okay? ﻿Can you pass that over? - What're you talking about? ﻿You're in love. ﻿Who could I fuck after being stuck at home for 6 months.? ﻿Just don't say I didn't warn you. ﻿You made me hungry. - Then eat. Who else is this for? ﻿I think we'll charge him.' ﻿I don't know... - Why not? ﻿It's not nice to charge for food. ﻿Have some kubeh, it'll just get thrown out. ’ ﻿I want to charge him. 40 for the meal, 80 for the couch. ﻿Plus 20 that he owes me. ﻿For what? ﻿When he needed money for the train. ﻿You owe us a thousand. ﻿A thousand? For what? - ﻿A thousand. ﻿And why are you being so generous? You're broke. ﻿Relax and eat. -Don't tell me to relax when he's ripping you off. ﻿The bastard's rich. ﻿Are you into him or something? ﻿Are you? ﻿Don't start in, Eden. ﻿You and your bullshit. Then I have to come up with the money. ﻿When did you ever give me money? ﻿I'm always giving you money. - Fine. Sit down and eat. ﻿What're you doing? I said not in the house. ﻿Put that out. ﻿Put out the cigarette. - Eden, put out the cigarette. ﻿Bringing home strangers...' ﻿I brought him? You brought him. ﻿I'll smash the house up and torch the TV. ﻿You think I have time for TV? ﻿It's your TV! - But you have time for your new boyfriend? ﻿You're showing off for him. ﻿I'll shove his head down the toilet. How's that? -How's that? - ﻿You're a little shit, that's how. ﻿Why doesn't he work? ﻿You're off house arrest, go get a job. ﻿He does, he collects bottles. - That's no job. ﻿It hurts you that I'm happy. - You little beast. ﻿Shit. Garbage. That's what you are. ﻿Get out of my house. - Shit, a beast, that's what I am. ﻿I'm a son of a bitch, okay? ﻿Get out. - A son of a bitch with a crazy mother. ﻿Out! ﻿Get out, you dirtbag! ﻿Out! ﻿Bottles? ﻿Here are your bottles! ﻿Trash! ﻿Keep that up and you can find a new home. ﻿Where're you going? - Tel Aviv. ﻿I'm coming with you. - I don't think so. ﻿Go home. ﻿Brown rice noodles with crispy chicken, scrambled egg, broccoli and sprouts. ﻿There's also Kung Fu, ﻿that's stir-fried pork with cashews and smoked goose ﻿which is really good. - I'll have what he's having. ﻿Funny. ﻿Gimme a shekel. - Huh? -Gimme a shekel. ﻿I'm gonna open a restaurant for my mom here in Tel Aviv. ﻿Great idea. ﻿We'll make it big, I'm telling you. ﻿The fish was good, wasn't it? ﻿Delicious. ﻿Listen, your mom's amazing. ﻿Sometimes she loses it. ﻿She goes on a week-long starvation strike. ﻿She doesn't eat for a week? ﻿She doesn't cook. ﻿She gives me money to eat out. Then I know something's wrong. ﻿Are your parents together? ﻿They never got married. ﻿My dad was already married when they met. ﻿Fuck all the dads. ﻿I saw him maybe once when I was nine. ﻿And then my mom got married and... ﻿had a daughter. ﻿Great idea, opening a restaurant in Tel Aviv. ﻿I think people here will like homemade food. ﻿Want to hear something? ﻿Reflections? - In the mirror. ﻿Doofuses... ﻿"I can't switch houses any more, I'm tired. ﻿Tve done it all my life. ﻿"So many houses, I remember moving when I was a kid. ﻿"My home is like a houseboat. We're moving again. ﻿"This time we're moving out of Gilad's house. ﻿"I really wanted a dad but all I got was Gilad. "And suddenly: Pack up, we're leaving." ﻿"I'm lonely, I'm miserable, I'm going crazy, I'm burning up. ﻿"I don't have a woman because I'm ugly as sin and I can't afford "to cover up my ugliness..." ﻿Louder. ﻿Speak up. - "I wouldn't mind giving it all up "but unfortunately I'm a healthy guy." - Yes, thank you. ﻿"My heart wants a place in the sun. ﻿"I have desires and dreams so I can't even give up. ﻿"Basically, whichever way you turn me, I'm a disaster." ﻿No more... ﻿You know what I went through? ﻿I'm sorry. Stop it. ﻿Disappearing without a word? I didn't sleep a wink. ﻿I made him come with me. ﻿Not a word out of you. ﻿What's up, Gabi? - How's it goin', Eden? ﻿We got 30 cans, 40 glass bottles, and... what was it? ﻿39 small bottles. ﻿Plastic. - Plastic. ﻿Does it work? ﻿Like new. ﻿Really? ﻿And it doesn't leak? -Not a drop. ﻿Is that it? ﻿How do you turn it on? - Move, I'll do it. ﻿I'm hungry. - There's plenty to eat. ﻿I like hot, heat it for me. - Eden, heat it up yourself. ﻿It's good. ﻿Want me to box some up for you? - No, he doesn't. ﻿Yes, I do. Butt out. ﻿So you're a man now. ﻿No, you're a man now. ﻿I am a man. - Oh, yeah? ﻿Don't overdo it. Ow. ﻿Don't overdo it, okay? ﻿You have to, you're playing Naor's brother. ﻿I'm playing him, not getting my hair cut like him. ﻿Okay, okay. Don't move. ﻿Cut off here. ﻿Eden. ﻿You son of a bitch. ﻿Shut up. ﻿Look at you. ﻿Son of a bitch. ﻿Gross. ﻿I phoned a thousand times. ﻿She doesn't answer. ﻿She doesn't answer. ﻿She doesn't answer. ﻿She got a new number, I managed to get it. ﻿I call, she doesn't answer. ﻿I missed her. ﻿The love of my life. It﻿'s hard after a year together. ﻿I took her to the best restaurants. ﻿I spent my whole salary on her. ﻿I pictured him running his fingers through her hair. ﻿I felt like I was boiling over. ﻿I wanted to burn him alive. ﻿In the end I messed up his face. ﻿I slashed him from here to here. ﻿I didn't want him to die. ﻿I wanted him to live and suffer. ﻿One, two, three... ﻿Action! ﻿Wait, I'm in the fight scene, too. ﻿No, Rikki, it's a fight scene. ﻿All I do is sit on the bench? I want to do something else. ﻿There is nothing else, Rikki. - I'll be Naor's brother's girlfriend. ﻿Wait, what about me? ﻿You're the cop. Go stand behind the camera, behind Re'em. -And? ﻿And come in when I signal you. ﻿Ready? One, two, three... ﻿Action! ﻿Police! Police! - Cut! Cut! Cut! ﻿What don't you get? I told you to stick it in the liver twist? ﻿Take the knife and stab him. ﻿Ever stab someone? -Yes. ﻿Then take the knife and stab. ﻿Feel your life is in threat, ﻿just stab him, like in real life. ﻿Ready? ﻿Let's go, let's go. Ready? ﻿Yeah. ﻿Action! ﻿Police! ﻿Police! Halt! Halt! ﻿Police! What happened? ﻿What happened? - Help him. ﻿Poli... - Cut! ﻿Guys, it was good... ﻿It was great. Well done. ﻿Assi. ﻿Assi. ﻿There's someone at the door. ﻿Assi... ﻿There's some kid there. ﻿What? - There's a kid there. ﻿What's the matter? ﻿Who's she, your girlfriend? ﻿Eden, what's the matter? ﻿Did you run away from home? ﻿Answer me. ﻿Here. ﻿He's one of the kids from the group I led. ﻿I know. Eden. ﻿Are you hungry? - No, he's not hungry. ﻿He doesn't eat when he's upset. ﻿Your mom's probably looking for you. Give me your phone, ﻿I want to talk to her. - I don't have a phone. -Don't drive me nuts. ﻿I need two nights. ﻿Can you help me? ﻿How can I help you if I don't know what happened? ﻿Can't sleep either? ﻿She isn't like I pictured her. ﻿Flow'd you picture her? ﻿Tell me the truth, ﻿just the truth. ﻿What? ﻿Do you love her? ﻿My mom? ﻿Swear you'll tell the truth. ﻿The truth is, no. ﻿You don't know her well enough. ﻿I hope my wife is like my mom. ﻿I used to think that too. ﻿That my mom would be your wife? ﻿That my wife would be like my mom. ﻿Well go home tomorrow and everything will be okay. ﻿Good morning. ﻿Looking for something? ﻿Do you live here? -Yes. ﻿Do you know him? ﻿Yes, he's a student in a group I led. ﻿When did you last see him? ﻿I don't know... about two months ago. ﻿If you hear from him, let us know. - Sure. ﻿Tell me... ﻿Why did you come to me? ﻿It's a murder case. ﻿We're checking everyone he knows. ﻿He stabbed a neighbor. Left a wife and a daughter, the bastard. ﻿Did you kill someone? ﻿I didn't want him to die. ﻿What if it's a dream? ﻿Maybe we're just dreaming, Assi. ﻿Assi, maybe we're dreaming. ﻿It's just a dream. ﻿Maybe we're dreaming, Assi. ﻿Maybe it's just a dream. ﻿Is it a dream, Assi? ﻿It's just a dream. ﻿It's just a dream. ﻿Assi... ﻿Please, Assi. ﻿Please. ﻿Assi. ﻿Assi. ﻿Assi! ﻿On Friday night in May 2012 Eden stabbed his neighbor to death ﻿Eden was sentenced for life in prison ﻿Ran Danker ﻿Adar Hazazi Gersch ﻿Hilla Surjon ﻿Bat-el Museri ﻿Liron Ben Shlush ﻿Elad Hudara, Riki Hodara, Elroi Fass Re'em Taco, Orel Sapir ﻿David Vili, Osher Amara, Melodi Frank, Idan Naftali, Shalev Girgin ﻿Director and Screenwriter Eliran Elya ﻿Producer Oren Rogovin ﻿Producer in Charge Asaf Nawi ﻿Casting by Orit Azoulay ﻿Cinematography by Shai Goldman ﻿Editing by Arik Lahav Leibovich ﻿Line Producer Yankale Amzalleg ﻿undtrack Design and Mixing by Yossi Appelbo Sound Recording by Ashi Milo ﻿Original music by Yoram Hazan, Ran Elmaliach ﻿Art Design by Yoav Sinai ﻿Costume Design by Sarit Sharara ﻿Makeup Artist Emily B ﻿Screenplay Editing by Gur Heller, Michal Vinik, Grit Azoulay ﻿Doubtful ﻿Translation and Subtitling: NG
