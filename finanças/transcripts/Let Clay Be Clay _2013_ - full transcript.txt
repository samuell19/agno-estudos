Hi, I'm Ms Tayback from the Internal Revenue Service. We've sent you several certified letters but they've all come back returned to sender. (laughs) - Oh sweet I have the IRS coming to my house, when they usually come to my bank account. - Well, I am trying to handle my case a little differently. I think this may just be a simple mistake. According to our records, you have been claiming your daughter as a dependent since she was born. That would make her 34 at this time. But we have information that she passed away. - She did not pass away, her destiny was denied by a murderer. - I'm sorry for your loss, I truly am sorry. - You know you don't have to be sorry, okay? There's enough sorry people in this world. What do you want me to be, huh? - What? - What do you mean, what? What are you here for? You need what? - You owe the government $63,000 and we will put a lien on your house and sell it in order to pay your debt. - I am 65 years old and retired. What am I supposed to do? What am I supposed to do? - I am just reading from the letter here, ma'am. - Wait, does that letter say miss ma'am don't even ma'am me, Ms. Tayback. What the fuck does that letter say? Does that letter say that I bought my house 40 years ago, 40 years ago. Working for my government, at the Post Office. - But you didn't- - What, no. - You didn't let me finish. (sighs) - I think there is a program, that can help you if I can just find the paperwork for it and have you fill it out. - I'm not filling out shit, do you hear me? You think I'm some kind of fool that I'm gonna let you come into my house and take my house. And then you say I willingly did it, no. The only way I'm gonna leave this house, is inside a pine box. - Let me help you. - Oh, no, no, shut the fuck up. - Please, let me help you. I can help you fill out these papers so that we can start the process. - You know what, my baby was a rightful deduction, a rightful deduction. That was taking away from me, oh, shit. And I paid my taxes that was supposed to go to the police, to find the person who killed my daughter. But no, instead they're laying off the police in Oakland. They laid him off, are those Tax Dollars? Fuck, I mean, the Tax Dollars, are they going to a resources to find the killer of my daughter? - I don't, I'm just a Tax Collector, Mrs. Sparks. Look, Mrs. Sparks, I don't know very much about your particular case but, I'm here because I care. I'm here to help, to help people like you, to find a way out of a mess. And maybe if you can't pay, we can help you. Please just, (paper rustling) just fill out these forms.

(laughs) - I'm sorry, it's just an unusual name for a black person in Oakland. - Not really, I see you're not an Oakland Raider fan. Here, have a seat. Turn out say your lines clearly and just go over while I talk to these gentlemen. - Mr. Burski, my partner I just went over a 20 year Cold Case regarding Erica Sparks. Now it seems the case was just dropped. You had two prime suspects Archie Andrews, who was a suspected pimp dealer and Mercedes Riviera, who was arrested for prostitution. She wasn't a prostitute, she was a 15 year old victim turned out by her boyfriend. And I was a little busy that weekend. We had a white officer shoot an unarmed black man. And people were about to riot so I spent all my time on crowd control. We didn't have DNA so we had to depend on concerned citizens in our part of town snitches don't exist. - So that's what took the officers off the Sparks murder? - Emphasis of the Sparks murders not the issue. You know, nobody gives a damn when a kid gets murdered a black one at that. Man we did everything we could there was a riot going on. Thousand people showed up to protest this slime that just robbed a bank that gotten shot by a white officer. But nobody cared about these kids, nobody. It was a funniest thing ever saw the next month I retired. Now I do this, I work with some kids that I can say. So if you gentlemen can excuse me, I got a rehearsal in progress. All right, you guys, let's take it over from the top. And Hoby pull up your pants. - Ma'am thank you for your time. But the whole reason we're here is we just came across some new information on Archie Andrews when your prime suspects back then and we just had to follow up. - Wait, I always thought Archie was dirty, but we never had anything on. The thing you really need to know is that if he committed the crime, he did it as a juvenile. And so we'll be prosecuted as a juvenile and nothing much is ever gonna happen to him, sorry. Okay kids, let's take it from the top. - Come in. - Hi, Mrs. Sparks, we spoke on the phone under tech. - Davenport yes, I'm so excited to meet you. (laughs) Have a sit. - Thank you. I want to be with you face to face and find out from you what you might remember and maybe wanna share. I have to tell you, I'm only on this part time. So the results you get might not be as fast as you would like but we will find the person who did this. - Persons, persons. There was more than one. That's what they had to shoot her she was strong she could fight, she was not pushover. - There was quite a bit of blood evidence. - Yeah well. - But only from one male and her. - Mm. - Now however, there was DNA evidence on a crack pipe. - Mm. - And fingerprints from two other individuals. I was reading some reports and I saw similar notations that you had a hunch that her girlfriend Mercedes Riviera had information. - Mm, Mercedes do that have her? Well, let me just tell you this. My daughter was very honest with me. She said she was not hanging out with that Jezebel Mercedes anymore. My daughter's graduating she was accepted to San Jose State University. She was majoring in communications. That girl was jealous of her, mm. And that boyfriend of hers, someone the pimp his name was called what? (laughs) Matgod, kind of a fool was that? - Mm. - Huh?
