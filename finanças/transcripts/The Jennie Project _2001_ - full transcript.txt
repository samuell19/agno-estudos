♪♪ Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. Don't believe him. He's really the evil twin. It's just a stupid show. Well, that's just a stupid comment. Andrew! Daddy! Sarah: Hey! [Laughs] Hey! Mmm! Sarah: Daddy! I can't believe it. I'm so glad to see you guys. Hugo? You're all hairy. [Laughs] Look at you. You must have grown a foot. Just a couple of inches. I was gonna call, but I wanted to surprise you. Surprise. I was beginning to wonder if we were ever gonna see you again. Did you bring me anything? Uh, well...Sort of. Hugo...why is your luggage moving? I can explain. [Sniffing] Aah! [Screams] Oh, no. Come on, girl. [Grunts] It'll be ok. The villagers call her jenniquasigo, which means "little one who makes herself look big." And chimps are protected. There's supposed to be no hunting in ituri, but.... That doesn't stop the poachers. Their big prize is capturing a chimp alive and ready to sell on the black market. But sometimes they misjudge the strength of the poison in their arrows. That's what happened to jennie's mother. [Chimps chattering] [Chimp screeches] [Speaking native language] Hugo: She was pregnant, so she was left to die. It's a slow death, the muscles, organs, shutting down one at a time. Female. Pan troglodyte. She's pregnant. [Speaking native language] They say poachers like this ought to die. They used too much poison. She's not gonna make it. [Speaking native language] They think you can save her. Tell them i'm-- I'm a ph.D. I'm not that kind of doctor. I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do. [Chimp grunts] I think she's going into labor, doctor. Now? Yes, doctor. Uh, bring her into the tent. I need some hot water, I need some towels. Hurry, there's not much time. It's a girl. [Speaking native language] [All laugh] Woman: Oh... This baby have powerful deefa. Deefa? Spirit...who guide this one. Shh. Jenniquasigo. Jenniquasigo. Jenniquasigo. Jenni...qua...sigo? You can call her jennie. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Leah... No. Wait-- no. Do me a favor. Keep an eye on her. She's had 3 ccs of Diazepam and I think she has a headache. Leah! [Sarah giggles] She looks like grandpa Joe. [Blubbers] Man, are you ugly. Ooh ooh ooh ooh. First, the lizard from Madagascar, then that thing, the rat from Brazil. Didelphis marsupialis. It wasn't a rat. Whatever. It ate Mrs. Palliser's tulip garden. Leah... This is only temporary. I promise. I missed you. You said 3 months and you were gone for 8. After your third letter, I just threw away the rest. I figured if you died of malaria, they'd send me a telegram. I know. I know it's hard for you to understand, but... Back there in-- in the ituri, I was accomplishing the most important work of my life. The most important work of your life is right here under this roof. I'm back, Leah. Do you really think you can just waltz back in here with a monkey under your arm and make everything all right? She's not a monkey, she's an ape. Ape. Ah, well, that changes everything. Sarah: Daddy! Yes, dear? Jennie just took a number 2 on reverend palliser's front lawn. I'll be right back. Where have I heard that before? [Chattering] Wow. This is good. You know, the wukamin consider grasshoppers a delicacy. That's disgusting. Actually, they're not bad. Very sweet. So, Andrew... Um, how's your schoolwork coming? Um...there's this kid named Vinnie, and he can tuck in his ears, and it looks like he doesn't have any. Your mom says your grades have slipped quite a bit this year. It's no big deal. If you want to prepare for Harvard or Princeton, you've got to start now. Dad, I'm 12. You know, when I was your age, I was already a sophomore in high school. Maybe I'm not as smart as you. Well, we know that's not true. Sorry, could you just move the milk away from the ape. All I'm saying is you have to start working up to your potential. Maybe I don't want to. Andrew! That's enough. Hugo, can't it eat outside? No, she won't eat outside because she thinks she's human. Can I be excused? Yes. We're not finished. You didn't care about my grades when you were in Africa. [Smacks lips] Andrew, that's not true-- that's not true. That's not true. Leave me alone. [Whimpers] He seems so angry. He's 12 years old, and he's growing up without a father. I'm gonna go to bed. [Wind howling] [Jennie whimpers] [House creaks] [Rattling] [Screech] [Boom] [Jennie screeches] Mmm...hugo... I just want US to be a family again. [Screeches] Aah! Oh! Honey? [Whimpers] [Yawns] Eech! Whoa! Oh... What the heck? Way to go, Jen. Hugo: I don't understand. I locked the door. Sheila: Well, then, buy a better lock. Or then again, how about a cage? I'm not putting her in a--- oh... I'll buy a better lock. Oh... Sarah: Why are there gummy fish in the toilet? Oh, my goodness. Either she goes or I go. No, I'm serious, Hugo. I know you are. Look, I'll talk to Walter, and I'm sure he knows somebody who can find a place for her. You are not leaving me here with that animal. There's no way. Leah, please. The specimens arrive today. They've been in transit for 36 hours. I got to get them into the lab for preservation. I will not baby-sit a chimpanzee. Look, she's probably not hungry, since she ate half the... Kitchen already, and, uh, if she gets dirty, uh, change her, like when the kids were little. I'll be back before 5:00, I promise. What--what-- I love you madly. Change her? You mean diaper her?! [Bicycle bell dings] This is Mandy, and this is Brent. Brent is rich. He drives a sports car. He's always happy. Mommy says he's a real dreamboat. [Chatters] [Screeches] Mommy! Now what? She bit off Brent's head! Cool. Just what I thought. All looks and no brains. Sarah, sweetie, why don't you try reading to her? Reading to her? Meanwhile, Andrew, would you try and fix the basement door? It's already broken-- just do it. [Screeches] Oh! Oh! Oh, no! Andrew, go! Go, go get her! Go get her! [Whistling the blue tail fly] [Screeches] Whoa! Frank, did you see a, um-- Archibald. I might have known. You tell your old man I still have the scar from that lizard bite, and if I get any grief from that baby gorilla-- reverend palliser's? Thanks, frank. [Broken glass clinks] Hmm. I'm not paying for this! Aw, gee... Ah, 4 pink tulips, 3 daisies, and one little chimpanzee. He--he--Hendrick... Hendrick! In his infinite knowledge and... Go away! Grace, god has-- in his infinite wisdom and grace... Oh, much better. Hendrick! Yes, dear. [Jennie screeches] The dryopithecus-hominid link is almost conclusive now. Move over Richard leaky, make way for Hugo Archibald. Of course, I'll need to go back and collect some more samples. To Africa? Yeah, I just need a little more time and money. Oh, it's scandalous, the funding situation in this country. But finding money for your return to the ituri should not be a problem. I mean, the work is monumental. Is something wrong? Walter, you remember that species-isolated chimp infant that I saved when I was in Africa? The lowland pan troglodyte. Yes. Pity you had to leave it behind. Yeah...well, I brought her home, Walter. Hey, that's very funny. The chimpanzee? You don't know anyone who might be interested in... Taking her off my hands, would you? Well, you could try the university research lab. They're always looking for new specimens. Tell you what I'll do. I'll give them a call. Tell them you're gonna stop by. Thanks, Walter. You're gonna be a star, Hugo. I mean it. Our research is primarily neurological. We map the brain. Subjects are used for approximately 2 to 3 years, barring infection. The operation takes about 16 hours, and, of course, it's irreversible. [Chimp whimpers] Would you like to see the rest of the complex? Dr. Archibald? Um, sure. Hello? Anybody home? [Jennie screeching] Good girl. Now...scissors. Scissors... Good. All right. Great. Now do rock. Make a fist. Down. No, no, no. Make a fist. Fist...and down. Make a fist... Down. What are you doing? Building a tree house. For Jenny. I think daddy ate too many grasshoppers. Course, in the winter time, we might have to bring her inside. Are you out of your mind? It's 8:00 at night. I mean, it's bad enough that ape almost gave poor Mrs. Palliser a heart attack this afternoon. No. Oh, yes. Hmm. Andrew... Huh? Cut me off a piece about 4 foot, will you? Do you mind telling me what's going on? Sometimes things happen, Leah. The randomness of events. You just can't control them. Don't you talk to me like I'm one of your research assistants, Hugo Archibald. I am your wife. You said we weren't keeping her. It's not that simple, Leah. It's not just research, it's jennie's mother died. She gave birth to jennie. But...it was my face that baby chimp saw for the first time. My hand she reached out to with absolute trust. My pant leg she held onto when she took her first step. She would have ended up in a 2-foot square box bound for China, or on someone's dinner table, or worse. Now where is that blasted t-square? Oh, um, uh... Is this it? Thanks. Um...can I help, dad? Not too late. All right. Yeah. All right. Grab that saw. Well, what do you think? We did it. Yep. We did. Go on, jennie. Give it a try. [Screeches] Dad, could I, uh... Knock yourself out. [Music box plays] [Coos] [Screeches] No way, Jen. Come on. She is a girl, you know. Human and chimpanzee DNA differ by only one percent, and we can exchange blood of the same type. Uh, chimpanzees have even been known to have the intelligence of an average 8-year-old... Check it out. [Whispers] Hi. [Students gasp] Oh...uh, yes? Boy: Um, yeah. What kind of stuff does she eat? Bananas, mostly. Bananas, grapes, sugar, anything she can eat. Just like you. Very nice. Very nice. Uh, yes? Girl: What's her name? Um...jenniquasigo is her real name. That's what it's short for. It's a tribal name. Yes, yes? Girl: Where does she come from? Uh, east Africa. A place called the ituri forest. Ituri forest. Go. [Whimpers] [Andrew laughs] Come on, jennie, come on! [Toilet flushes] [Whistling] There's a leach law in this town, Archibald, and a dangerous animals ordinance. Frank, you're scaring her. Her? Remember the... Harmless lizard? Jennie's not an animal. She's a primate, just like you and me, and evolutionarily speaking, she's our closest living relative. My relatives live in Jersey. I'm warning you, Archibald, you keep that thing away from me. Come on, Jen. ♪ For she's a jolly chimpanzee ♪ ♪ for she's a jolly chimpanzee ♪ ♪ for she's a jolly chimpanzee ♪ ♪ which nobody can deny ♪ Andrew: Make a wish, Jen. Sarah: Yeah, make a wish. Leah: Oh, hey. No. Sweetie, jennie, stop it. Come on, jennie. Get it--don't... Sweetie, Hugo... Use the fork-- don't stick your mouth in the cake like that. You think it's for eating? Is that what you think it is? [Doorbell] Hugo: Hang on, I'm coming. Yes? Dr. Hugo Archibald? At your service. I'm Dr. Prentiss. Wow! Pamela prentiss. I've read all your books. It's quite an honor. Why, thank you. [Laughs] I was given your name by a mutual friend. Walter Epstein. Sure, Walter. Yeah. He runs my department at the museum. Come on in! Walter tells me that you've got a species-isolated chimpanzee in your possession. Jennie. Jennie? That's her name. Huh. Well, I figured I was in the neighborhood, so I would stop by and take a look at her, since I'm usually at the mercy of my schedule. Oh, of course. Uh, she's watching TV. Television? In the family room. I see. Well, it's her birthday. I see. Would you like some cake? It's...A bit soggy. No, thank you. Well, right this way. Honey, we have company! She's the one on the floor. Hey! [Whimpers] Who is she? If you care to rot your brain, I have no qualms, but do it alone. You must be jennie. [Whimpers] I'm...pam. [Inquisitive whimper] We have a colony of 5 chimpanzees at the tahachee center, all of whom are learning sign language. Um...jenny would be our control. What we want to see is will the species-isolated chimp learn sign language quicker than the colony chimps? I have a bad feeling about this. Dad says she's a world-renowned primate specialist. Yeah? Big deal. She'll remain here, of course. Hugo, we agreed that this was just temporary. I would prefer to transfer her, but relocation might prove counterproductive to her learning progress. So...i will come here to do my research. Now, I must tell you, though, that this is not exactly the controlled environment that I had hoped for. Too many variables that might contaminate the data. We wouldn't want to contaminate the data. I will insist upon complete control over Jenny for 3 days a week. Those are my terms. You can use the living room. You can use the garage. Leah, don't be silly. I'm not the one being silly. The garage is fine. Now, if we can just settle upon your stipend, I'll have the legal documents drawn up. No stipend. No stipend, no paper. This is Jenny's home. I'm not signing it away. Those are my terms. Very well. I really would like to get started as soon as possible, so... I'll be here on Monday. Great. Great. Great. Oh, and I really think that we need to keep jennie away from refined sugars. She eats what we eat. That's what I'm afraid of. Both: Ohh! Ohh... Ahh! And it was a pleasure meeting you, too. Living room. All right. Here we go now. Yes. Me...pam. Me...pam. You...jennie. Ok? You...Jennie. Me...hugo. You... Jen. Dr. Prentiss says the key is repetition and reinforcement. Repetition and reinforcement. Right. Hugo... Jenny...apple. Jenny...down. Ah, good. Apple. Sarah. Sarah. Jennie. Jennie, look at me. Sarah. Sarah. Jennie, Sarah. [Sighs] Andrew. Andrew. Jennie. You don't get it. You don't understand, do you? [Cackles] Jennie, Andrew. [Sighs] Jennie, don't. Jennie... Oh, jennie, jennie, no. Andrew: Oh. Well, I can't say I blame you. Stupid idea anyway. Let's get outta here. Hey! What about me? Hmm. Andrew: 2 for the matinee, please. Yeah, it'll be $8.00. Puberty. [Elephant trumpets] [Bird chirps] [Lion growls] [Tarzan yells] [Imitates Tarzan yell] You got some explaining to do, young man. I-- upstairs. But-- now. Come on, jennie. No. Jennie, stay. Jennie doesn't want to learn sign language. And how do you know that, Andrew? She told me. Jennie spoke to you. Yeah, and I don't need sign language to understand her. She's the one who ripped the book. Andrew, it takes repetition and reinforcement-- reinforcement and repetition and reinforcement and repetition. I know. That's enough, Andrew. Well... At least somebody is learning something around here. What did he say? Ah. Your son doesn't like you very much, doctor. Hi, there. Look, Andrew, I never planned on raising a chimpanzee. Your mother certainly never dreamed of it, but we need Dr. Prentiss' help now. Wouldn't it make jennie's life richer if she could speak to US? If we could speak to her? That's what Dr. Prentiss is trying to do. Jennie's not an experiment, and that's all she is to Dr. Prentiss. Do you have any idea the stature Dr. Prentiss has-- I mean, as a scientist? Ph.d at 23. 15 years of fieldwork. Full scholarship at Harvard and Cambridge. Just like you. What is that supposed to mean? Your work is more important to you than anything else in the world, even your family. Is that what you think? You say you love US, but you always leave. Well, I'm not gonna waste my time talkin' to somebody who's obviously not mature enough to listen. [Sighs] What? All right now. Jennie. You, jennie. [Cackles] What is this? [Jennie screeches] Ok, ok. Apple. Pfft. Apple. Ok, ok, ok. Don't you dare. I'm warning you. Hugo's colleagues are gonna be here in one hour. They will sit at my table and eat my food and use words that I don't understand, and I will sit there, smiling pleasantly back all evening. Do you think I'm looking forward to that? Huh? I think not. So help me, I will lock you in the basement. [Whimpers] That's better. [Gasps] Oh, you horrible creature. That's it. I have had it with you, young lady. [Screeches] Oh, you let go, you miserable beast. Ok, you stay there. Stay. Stay. What? What? Hug who? Who are you? Jennie, that's right. Come here. Come on. Oh, good. Good job. Wait. Wait. Wait right here. Kids. Kids. You guys, come down here. Hurry up. What? What is it? What? What's wrong? Watch. Watch this. Watch this. Jennie. Jennie. Who is this? Yes. Yes. She understands. Go. Call your father. He's at the office. Sarah: Sarah. Sarah. She spoke! She spoke! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Walter, she spoke. Who? Jennie. She understands. Tremendous. Have you called Pamela?

Just waitin' to see if my funding came through. Are you goin' back to Africa, Dr. Archibald? That's the plan. You know, it must be hard to leave someone as attractive as Mrs. Archibald for such long periods. Yes, it is, frank. How's your talking chimp? Just fine. You know, I'll keep an eye out for that letter for you, Dr. Archibald. Thanks, frank. Have a nice day, frank. Leah: You look so beautiful. Ok, opinions. I think she looks moronic. I think she looks beautiful. Thank you. What do you think? Well... I think she deserves the dignity not to be treated like some sort of a circus animal. Come on, jennie. How dare you talk to me like that. This is my house and jennie is... Your what, Mrs. Archibald? She's reached the age where she needs to live in a safe environment. And that would be the tahachee center run by you, of course. You have no claim to jennie. Hugo, there's no need for animosity here. Dr. Prentiss' concern is genuine. The situation is impossible. Jennie's being tended to by a housewife with 2 undisciplined children. You will not refer to my wife as "housewife" or my children as "undisciplined." We are not experiments. We're not subjects in a laboratory. We are a family. Jennie is loved and cared for in our home, a piece of data which you conveniently overlook. Dr. Archibald, jennie's worth to science far outweighs any personal feelings that you or your family might have for her, and you know that no chimpanzee has ever lived with a surrogate human family past the age of adulthood, an age which jennie is rapidly approaching. Jennie is probably the smartest, brightest chimpanzee I have ever worked with. She is leaving the colony chimps in the dust. Dr. Archibald, the tahachee center would be willing to pay you a substantial amount of money for jennie. I've been authorized to offer you $70,000 for her. As per our agreement, Dr. Prentiss, you study jennie at our home. If this situation is no longer suitable for you, then your project with her is over. Thank you, Walter. Hugo. We've been friends for a long time. That aside, I think you're one of the most brilliant scientists I've ever known. What are you getting at, Walter? Usually, an animal imprints with the first living soul it sees. Jennie imprinted you as her father. She imprinted your family as her family. You've raised a chimpanzee that thinks she's human, but there's a danger... That the imprinting can go both ways. [Laughs] What, do you think I think jennie is my daughter? I'm speaking to you colleague to colleague, Hugo. Now, you're trying to secure funding for a project that could be the most important work in natural history in decades. Do you really want to have a feud going with Dr. Prentiss, one of the preeminent primatologists in the world? A cage is a cage, Walter. Jennie doesn't belong in a cage. [Sighs] Leah: Oh, here's one bag for you. Anything good? Lots of refined sugar. [Screeches] Oh! [Screeches] Andrew. Get her out of there. What? Whoa! Sarah: Jennie. Hey, jennie. Stop. Stop. Leah: Andrew, please. Leah: Jennie. Get down. Jennie. Get down. Jennie. Leah: I don't know. Get down, jennie. Stop. Jennie. Sarah: Come on, jennie. Be a good girl. Give me those back. Sarah: No! Jennie. Not the marshmallows! Jennie, come back down here, please. Sarah: Jennie, stop. Jennie. Andrew: Stop. Jennie, come back. [Dog barks] Hello. Anybody home? Dr. Archibald? [Knocks] [Dog barks] Man on TV: Has been nothing short of very violent. We've received so many applications... Oh! Hey, Archibald. Hey, frank. Your old man around? No. What about the, uh, the--the--the chimp? You don't have to worry. Jennie's with Dr. Prentiss. I think this might be the letter your dad's been waitin' for. It looks sort of important. It must be tough growin' up without your dad around. You know, Archibald, you hang around that chimp so much, I can't help but notice, but you're startin' to look a little bit like her. Don't you think it might be time you started to hang with some of your own species? People are talkin'. Thanks for the info, frank. Just lookin' out for ya, Archibald. Any mail for me? Um, uh, no. Nothin'. Tell mom I'll be workin' late. Uh, sure thing. Andrew: When dad went to Africa, he told me to look at the brightest star in the sky and think of him, and then he'd do the same for me, and that way, we'd always be together. I was just a little kid then, and I believed that kind of stuff. I don't feel much like a little kid anymore. Dad's letter came today. He got the funding to go back to Africa. He'll probably be gone for another 8 months. Sometimes, when he's away, I forget what he looks like, and I forget what he sounds like. Yes. A letter bad. I want you to know I called the veteran's administration. They mailed it Thursday. First Thursday of the month like they do every month. Yeah. If it says "Mr. Elton crabb" on it, I put it in your mailbox. Don't you get sassy with me, mail boy. I want you to know I stormed the beaches at normandy. Just keep livin' in the past, old man. [Horn honks] I heard that. Frank, they shut my phone off last week because I didn't receive my bill on time. I'm sorry. I have no idea-- woman: Frank? Yes? Where are my catalogs, frank? Are you reading my catalogs? I don't read catalogs, Mrs. Babbit. I hate catalogs. I really do. I want you to know, frank Russo, I lodged a complaint with the postmaster. Right. Ok, everybody just take a deep breath and calm down. You mean-- they're gonna cut off my cable-- I want my mail! Quiet! Quiet. Ooh, ooh, ok. All right. Obviously, something has seriously gone wrong. I promise all of you that I'll get to the bottom of this. I will find your mail. Sir, ladies, excuse me. Good-bye. No, I'm over here. I mean, I read things that come in the mail. Frank: It looks like it might rain. Frank. Frank. [Frank whistles] What the-- whoa. Elton crabb. It's the chimp. Ooh. [Grunts] Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Whoa! Oof! Mmm. Unh. [Chatters] [Chatters] Easy there, bonzo. No one needs to get hurt over this. Jennie. [Jennie screeches] No one messes with the u.S. Mail. Frank, no. Run, jennie. Ow! Why don't you pick on someone your own size? Ooh. Ooh. That's it, Archibald. Your chimp is done for. I'm filing charges. [Engine starts] My truck. She's in my truck! Ah! Jennie! No, jennie, no! [Horn beeps] Jennie, hit the brakes! [People shouting] Andrew! Hit the left pedal! Archibald! Hey! Oh! Andrew: Jennie! Stop! Stop the truck! Stop! Frank: Hey! Help! Hit the left--the brakes. The left pedal. Frank: Hey! I want my truck! Oh, Jen, look out! Please look out! Oh! Ooh! Whoa-ho-ho-ho! Whoa-ho-ho-ho! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-ho-ho-ho! Jennie, look out! Andrew: Jennie. [Gasps] My truck. [Bell rings] Jennie! [Screeches] Jennie, look out! [Growls] Dad! My truck! Doggone, it's full! Jennie, it's ok! Aah! [Cries] Oh! Oh, what am I gonna tell my supervisor? Oh! Oh, look at this! Woman on P.A.: Dr. Abel... Hello, can I get some help? What do we have here? Uh, dislocation, contusion, possible fracture. Oh, are you a doctor? Uh, ph.D. Hugo Archibald. Patient's name? Jennie Archibald. Let's take a look. [Coos] [Gasps] Is this some kind of a joke? I'm sorry? Get this animal out of here. This is a hospital for humans only, in case you haven't noticed. Woman on P.A.: Residents, op one. Surgical residents, op one. Here. Put jennie over there. I'll be right back. Dad, maybe we should-- Hugo: This is outrageous! Hey. Hey. You mean, you're gonna refuse her admission? Yes. What's your name? I'm taking down your name. If you don't remove her immediately, I'm calling security. Oh, Jen. Sit down right here. [Coos] Is that good? Right. [Whimpers] Ok. Andrew love jennie. It's gonna be ok, Jen. Her name... Is j-e-n-n-i-e. Jennie. Andrew: Don't worry, jennie. Feel better soon. Please. Can't you see she's hurt? Nurse: She understands sign language? Nearly 100 words. May I please see the attending physician? I'll get him. [Sighs] How is she? [Sighs] She's gonna be fine. It's just a minor fracture. She'll have to wear a soft cast for a couple of weeks. They say she'll be back to her old self in no time. You sure you're all right? Yeah. You? She almost ran me over. [Both laugh] [Coos] I think this little girl belongs to you. Jennie. Hey. Ooh! Look at that. Look at that, huh? Andrew: Thank you. Thanks. All right. Let's get outta here. [Gavel bangs] Bailiff: Next case. The matter of frank Russo versus jennie Archibald. That's me. Ooh! Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. And you are the plaintiff? Uh, yes, your honor. Uh, it's an honor, your honor. And the defendant? Uh, your honor, uh, she's not--not-- not--not here yet. My husband-- and you are? I'm Leah Archibald. I'm--I'm the defendant's... Uh, mother. Well, you don't sound too sure about that. Well, oh! That's--there he is. I'm gonna sit. [Coos] Um, sorry, your honor. Um, she needed to use the bathroom. [Bangs] Order! Order, please. Why is that animal in my courtroom? Uh, this is the defendant, jennie Archibald. I'll have order or I'll clear the courtroom. Don't let that face fool you, your honor. This--this is no ordinary monkey. Uh, she's actually not a monkey at all, your honor. She's an ape. All right. I'll bite. Read the charges against this defendant. "Under county ordinance 4019, "jennie Archibald, the defendant, "is charged with causing grievous bodily injury and being a threat to public safety." She defiled and stole mail, too. That's a federal offense. These are serious charges. Under the law, if found guilty, the animal would have to be destroyed. Do you mind telling me what happened? Uh, well, I wasn't there, you honor, but perhaps you could ask her. Don't make a mockery of my court, doctor. You'll find I get very cranky when litigants do that. I would never do that, your honor, but you see, frank is right about one thing. Jennie is no ordinary animal. She's a very special individual. She's more like you or me than any other creature on this planet. Believe me, I know. And if you'll allow it, I'll show you that jennie is capable of answering any question put to her concerning the charges. Miss trousdale. What is this? Hugo: Miss trousdale is an official American sign language interpreter registered with this very court. With your permission? Oh. Swear her in. The monkey? She's an ape! [Gavel bangs] Just do it. Place your right hand on the Bible. Swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. [Coos] Ask the monkey-- I mean ape-- why she attacked the mailman. She says, "give jennie apple." Hugo: Um... Please let her try again, your honor. Judge nembhard: Please be quiet, people. Miss trousdale, you want to try again? [Coos] Jennie. Why jennie hurt frank? Please sit down, young man. Let me do the questioning, if you don't mind. Miss trousdale: Uh, your honor, she's speaking. Judge nembhard: What's she saying? [Coos] Jennie says, "frank bad." Say, I resent that. Can she elaborate? [Coos] Miss trousdale: I don't understand. She's saying, "frank bad. Hurt Andrew." Frank: Oh, wait a minute. What kind of chimpanzee court is this? It's the letter. Andrew? Judge: Dr. Archibald? Your honor, this is my son Andrew. Andrew, is there something you need to share with US? Go ahead. Jennie hurt frank because he delivers letters. Letters? Well, not-- not all letters. One letter. The letter that said you were going back to the ituri. Back to Africa to do more research. I got the Grant. And I was so angry when you got it, I tore it up. And jennie was with me, and I guess she thought I was mad at frank. Your honor, I'm Dr. Pamela prentiss. I can handle this, Pam. With all due respect, doctor, I don't think you can. Who is this? Dr. Prentiss is one of the most celebrated primatologists in this country. She's the one responsible for jennie's language skills. I must say, this is quite an honor, Dr. Prentiss. I've read all your books. Why, thank you. If the court is interested, I believe that I might have a simple solution to this somewhat complex problem. I'm all ears. But, your honor, wo-- Mr. Russo, Dr. Archibald, Dr. Prentiss, if I may please see you in my chambers for a short recess. Bailiff: All rise! [Jennie cackles] Where are the kids? I took them back to school. So what did the judge say? [Softly] Oh, Hugo, no. It's ok. It's all right. I mean, it's better this way. I don't think... I don't think it's fair that you should have to take care of the kids and jennie while I'm in-- while you're what? [Sighs] You're not actually considering going back. This is important, Leah. Yes, it is, Hugo. Yes, it is. They're going to be devastated. First jennie, and then you. We were just starting to feel like a family again. I haven't been up here in a while. [Coos] You did a good job. It's held up well. Jennie... Jennie, go with Pam today. [Whimpering] No. Hugo no go. [Moans] You know, a good friend once told me that you have a powerful deefa... And I believe him. Jennie? Jennie? Jennie? Jennie? Ah. Ahh. Hi, there. How are you? She's as strong as 7 men, doctor. What's she going to be like in a year or 2? She needs a controlled, disciplined environment. She belongs to science now. We both know it's for the best. You mean, the best for Dr. Pamela prentiss. Dr. Archibald, we both have our careers, and I have dedicated my entire life to mine. And no matter what you and your family might think, I care about jennie an awful lot. [Jennie cackles] [Jennie screeches] Dad... Hey, kiddo. Check this out. That's fantastic. I pulled my average up an entire letter grade. Wait'll I tell Jen. Andrew-- where's Jen? Jennie? Jen. Jennie! Hey, jennie! Andrew! Andrew. Jennie! Jennie. Honey? [Shouting] Jennie! Jennie! Jennie. Where is she? The judge thought it best for her to live at the tahachee center. No! How could you?! Andrew! Andrew! Yeah. Yeah, he's been missing for 5 hours. Don't tell me that I can't file a missing persons report. He's only 12 years old. No, not the chimp, my son. Forget the chimp. Forget that I even brought the chimp up. Please, officer, I just need you to help me find my little boy. Yes. I appreciate that. I do. Thank you very much. Yes. Thank you. I've searched everywhere. I don't understand what he's thinking. I've called all his friends, the neighbors, the police. This is all my fault. You can say that again. I know where Andrew went. I never should have let that woman take her without at least a good-bye. He went to the hot cheese center. What did you say? The hot cheese center. Melted cheese? What do you mean, sweetie? He went to see jennie. The tahachee center! That's what I said. Of course! Uh, grab the keys. [Jennie whimpers] Jennie hungry? I brought your favorites. Jennie, eat. [Jennie whimpers] Please? I understand. [Snort] [Snoring] Jennie? Jennie! Jennie. Jennie? Jennie! [Jennie screeches] Jennie. Jennie-- jennie, you knew I'd see you again. All right, let's get outta here. Oh! We can't get out. It's locked from the outside. What am I gonna do now? Oooh. [Thunder] Mom, dad? Shh. Everything's all right. Hey. Hey. Where's Jen? She's just fine. We can't leave her here. We're not going to. She's going back home. Really? I decided to go back to Africa. [Thunder] One last trip. You're gonna take her back, aren't you? We think we might be able to return Jenny to the ituri. What about the poachers? Well, the land that jennie was born in was recently made a sanctuary. She'll be protected. You know, very few apes have ever returned to the wild after having lived in captivity. Unless, of course, you are able to find jennie's family group, and maybe-- that they might just accept her, and she, them. I'd sure like it if you came along. Me? All of US. [Giggles] Mmm. All right! Oh, I can't wait to go. Hugo: Yeah, when you see it, you'll meet my friend kwele. All right. Thanks. Let's go now. [African chorale sings] [Jennie coos] Heh heh heh. Welcome, my old friend. Kwele, it's been a long time. Yes, it has. [Laughs] This is my family. Hey, kwele. Hey. Nice to finally meet you, kwele. Pleasure to meet you. Ahh! This one's a little young for research assistant. [Laughs] [Laughs] And who is this? This beef grow big! What that tell you? Big trouble, no? [Laughs] Yeah, they're all big trouble. Welcome. Come, come. [Cooing, chattering] Andrew: My father, being a man of science, believed in a natural order of all things. He believed that the world is a place to be comprehended, dissected, and classified. But jennie taught him something: That we see the world not only through our eyes, but through our hearts. It's time to go. [Jennie coos]
