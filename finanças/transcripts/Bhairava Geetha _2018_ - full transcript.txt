Extracted by-A. R. XOY The truth that we understand by closely observing the history is that There were more wars between rich and poor rather than between different religions and castes. When the atrocities of the masters reached intolerable peaks, a rebellion would be born in the those communities that are oppressed. The masters would create a complete mayhem to suppress that rebellion. But nobody can stop any rebellion which is meant to prevail justice. When the atrocities of the masters becomes fire, the anger of the oppressed become a volcano. There would be a motivational story in every revolution that took place in the world. Similarly, this is the love story of the factual conflict that took place few years ago near the border of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. The story of a revolution which started due to a girl named Geetha falling in love with a guy named Bhairva is nothing but Bhairava Geetha BHAIRAVA GEETHA Oh God! Hey Bhairava, Wake up I told you we need to leave early It's already late, get up. What happened to your hand? Wooden splinter got stuck in my finger while bringing wooden logs in the morning. Just like your father, blood is not a new thing for you Eat quietly. Don't go to fetch wooden logs from now on. Hmmm, well said. We both are used to bloodshed. You eat Come soon as you finish your work - Flat tyre again? - Yes Where have you been yesterday? The new girl who came to sell liquor She smiles and winks at me Been to enquire whether it is love or infatuation. Why are you staring like this? Men's life will be at stake if it doesn't rain in the desert Women spoil by hinting Men spoil by not grasping it You have no idea about love and I am explaining this to you! Move on. Shall I cut you? Who kept this here? I did Last year same day, Chanmallappa's men killed our men at Kumbalgudda So... Who told you to worship these son of witches slaves? Throw this to the gutter Listen to me Because they saved your life... To whom else these slaves sacrifice their lives other than me? Just because this cock dies for me in cock fight You want me to worship this cock? I feed it, so that it dies for me in the field Labours must be ill treated Or else, these son of witches demand equality Greetings, Balaramanna Hey, Shankarappa You should join hands with the person who is elder and about to become your in-law should not face in the bet. Please don't mistake me, Balaramanna. This is a bet. This bet has a value, only when we fight with a wise person like you. Let's see. Elder's say, we should always grow a relationship with a reputed family. Where else my daughter can get a reputed family other than your's? My wish to get my only daughter Geetha married to your son is fulfilled with this bet. There is no other wise family than yours. When is your daughter coming back? She's coming home next week as she's done with the studies Greetings, Balaramanna Greetings Why are you dull? Even after knowing everything you are getting Geetha married to Nanjamari Power is like a shadow on the wall Even if weak person, stand properly in front of light, he looks like a super man If we are building a relationship with Balaramappa, it means we we are standing properly in front of light Nanjamari is not light, master. He is fire. They know nothing about you, master master, please don't. Master, please don't whip him. No, master... He did not know what he was doing. Master, please don't beat I beg you, please don't beat He did not know what he was doing please spare him, master Will it not the fire burn you if you touch it without knowing? It will burn No, master... Fire can not understand your plead. You should understand how and where it burns Please spare him, master... Open your eyes. Open your eyes. Don't think it ends by closing eyes. If you are thinking like that, it means that you don't know about me properly. Watch without blinking, how that crow-bar slowly pierces into his body. Watch how it comes out from his head at the end. I am killing him now because your son fathered such a son. Will he die when it reaches intestine? Will he die when it reaches chest? Will he die when it reaches the skull? You must watch it If you don't want that to happen, send your daughter-in-law tonight I will make her a fine girl and send back. Come in Go down and bring madam's luggage Let us bring the luggage, come Let's go I would have brought them on my own, if I had proper legs Had dinner? I was waiting for you, my son I told you many times, not to wait for me, but you don't listen Have I ever had food with out you? You please eat Geetha is back Got late due to shopping in town Oh! Geetha came back? How does she look like She looks like an educated girl Do not speak like this in front of Geetha Learn to speak properly I am what I am, Why should I fake in front of her? It's not like that Rich men care about their daughters more than their property That's why I said Alright, leave it Geetha, you just came home yesterday. Instead of resting, you are ready to roam around! Did I cam from so far, just to be at home? Hmmmm, in that case - Malla - master Send few boys with her Okay master No need of them. I'll go alone. There is no need in town, but here you need them You are the daughter of Shakarappa. You must take our men with you Geetha ma'am Bairappa on the hill is a very powerful god Yes Slicing three lemons on the steps apply Kumkum and turmeric Go round the boulder place one on the trident My wish must be fulfilled or else you are not Bairappa at all if you pray in this way, Your prayer will be answered I do not believe in God What did she say? O Bairappa, grant me a girl I don't mind, even if she has no left hand What is that? It is a very strange sound! Isn't it? Stop it. It is the sound of dove. It makes sound when it sees anything strange. What did it see that made it sound so strange like that? Probably it's you. Madam You are so surprised by dove sound, You will feel overwhelmed when you see blackbucks Blackbucks are there! A lot of black bucks would come and hop around here. Two eyes are not enough to see them. Let's go there tomorrow Get up slowly, this is where the blackbucks come. I don't see any blackbuck Hey wait man... Be quite Blackbuck you said! Where is it? Rama went in search of a deer Ravan kidnapped Sita What if you go behind a deer and someone kidnaps you? That is why deer is not showing up You cripple! If you keep fooling around I'll break your another leg Not the second one, please! Will we keep quite, if someone tries to kidnap Geetha ma'am? We will sacrifice them to Bairappa Is there no one in this village? Shanka, tell her what happened. Don't know exactly what happened! Don't know from they came! They massacred even children and aged people. They torched the town. The whole town turned to cemetery before sunrise I feel goosebumps by imagining it. Few people escaped with their children. All that is left is burnt walls and memories of dead people That old lady stay here as a sole witness. Hey old lady, fruits don't fall for prayers. She is waiting for those flowers. She worship in that abandoned temple Hey Bhairava, pluck those flowers Geetha ma'am Old lady's son, daughter and grandchildren were murdered that day Her whole family got killed. What did you pray to God? I prayed to God to behead the one who brought this situation to this village. Hey old lady Can't you just leave this place and get settled in a neighbouring town? Even vengeance is aging. Was I able to reach these flowers ten minutes ago? Didn't your friend plucked them and placed in my hands? Similarly, the head of the person who brought havoc to this village would be in my hands. Who is the person responsible for this? Who else? It is Shankarappa He is hiding behind the swords of hired slaves he is forgetting his death We should remind him of his death Is Shankarappa a child to get scared? We should take off those swords in right time Fear is stronger than swords, Jangaiah Right opportunity should come Right opportunity should come Brother, the daughter of Subba Reddy is wandering in the village hillocks. I have found a match for you His name is Nanjamari Shall I once... You should only think of what to study and wear I decide in marriage matter Just do what I say You told your mom that you want to go to the town tomorrow Yes, I will go with our men Car stereo: "John Denver's You filled up my senses song" Shanku, why you look dull? Don't you like the song? What kind of a song? He has a voice of of an ass Hey, do you who the singer is? Whoever it may be! They are nothing compared to Bhairava's songs Bhairava, you sing!? He sings so well The crops swing by listening to his songs Hey, sing now "You turn red if you take bath in anthill" "You turn black if you go with flock of crows" "You turn ghee if you dip into silver" "Forgive me, I can't sing so well" "Oh clever horse!" "It is difficult to mount and get down. It is a king's horse" "You turn red if you take bath in anthill" "You turn black if you go with flock of crows" "Clothes to sell and clothes to wear, you have granted" "Tie jingle to a bird and fly it to the sky" "Sami's wedding is a monkey's play" "I sang irrelevant lines you will say good bye to me" "Monkeys trouble in fair too, I want nothing" "Shall we make the moon sell snacks?" "Let's play hopscotch with him" "Where did you to learn to smile, O Channapattana doll?" "Sun feels thirsty seeing your smile" "Lake replaced the river and canal replaced the lake" "You turn red if you take bath in anthill" "You turn black if you go with flock of crows" "You turn ghee if you dip into silver" "Forgive me, I can't sing so well" "Oh clever horse," "It is difficult to mount and get down. It is a king's horse" "You turn red if you take bath in anthill" "You turn black if you go with flock of crows" Ouch! Probably, they are Kote Veerappa's men. There is no one left in his gang. We killed all their men in the recent fair. When they came to know we are becoming in-laws to Balaramappa. Those cowards left the village out of fear. Can it be Gowda's men whom we killed in Mavingudda? His people are educated. The hand which holds a pen wouldn't have guts to hold a sword. Who can it be? Is it Rudrappa? Channamallaiah or Changalraya? It's a shame, master What did you say? When our girl has been attacked we are just thinking about who did it, instead of chopping heads is it not an insult, master? If we catch hold of the one who attacked my daughter, what should be done? He should be burnt alive, master what if, not burnt? People will think, Shankarappa is a coward If people think that way, will anyone fear me in this town? I swear on Geetha, master it means I am dead Get me petrol, Malla Why master? What did I do, master? Please don't, master! You told me to burn, I am burning you see One who attacks my daughter should be burnt Why did you do this, master? How dare he touch my daughter? He is one among us, master Everyone must know this will happen to the one who touch my daughter Throw his body in city centre, saying he was involved in yesterdays's attack If I don't do anything to the people who attacked my daughter my reputation will be spoiled Find out who did it and slit their throats The attacker must realise how big his mistake was What happened? Why are you bleeding? Some men tried to kill Geetha ma'am Oh God! Come, sit here. Sit here. Didn't notice even after blood got clot? Geetha got hurt too While protecting her People are there to take care of Geetha But did you forget that I have only you? You are the one who said bloodshed is not new to us then why do you cry? Shut up What if something bad had happened to you today? What could have been my condition? Can't dare to imagine! Enough of all this. We don't need fighting and bloodsheds Your uncle is living peacefully He is farming in neighbouring village Let us go there, do farming and live peacefully No. I walk my father's path, whether I take life or give life, it will be for only Shankarappa. - Geeth - Yes. I told you to try that dress for tomorrow's engagement. But, what are you doing? Mom, I don't like this engagement. What? I don't like this engagement. Everything is arranged Without any reason, how can you say you don't like this engagement? Did you think about your father's reputation? People will gossip that Shankarappa's daughter revolted Geetha, reputation matters the most to your father Get ready instantly Water, master Control yourself till the engagement gets over. You are free after that. She has an attractive frontal. I am going mad thinking about her back. Groom Mr.Nanjamari son of Balaramappa, Bride Ms.Geetha, daughter of Mr. Shankarappa Engagement is about to be conducted between them Engagement is duly performed, master Did I ask you? You bloody slave! Hey Nanjamari! Nanjamari, leave her Geetha, you go inside. She studied abroad She is not aware of our customs. I pampered her, that's my mistake She slapped you out of ignorance, she will adopt after the wedding Please forget this matter right here. Start the vehicles Hey Geetha Is your brain working or did you left it at the city while coming here? Don't you know how to behave with people? I did what I felt right, father. What is right? To slap Mr Nanjamari for the sake of that dog? He can't judge what is right or wrong when he loses his mind. He would just behead people. He would have burned you if he didn't respect me. Try to understand. Bhairava is one of us. He can sacrifice his life to save me. How can I keep quite, when such a person is beaten for no reason? Even he knows to beat without any reason. Reason? Nanjamari is your husband to be. He will pet the dogs if he likes or kills them Those dogs are here for us You are not a kid to make you understand the difference between a king and a slave Instead of marrying an unpredictable mad dog it is better to marry loyal and loving Bhairava, dad. Geetha You are crossing my line, Geetha. Those boundaries are for you, dad What happened, brother? My heart is burning like hell, Vishwa How dare she, raise hand to me in front of the crowd! I am not able to bare it! I should do something to her. I must do something to her Can anything be spoken without any slightest thought in the mind, Malla? It can't be, master. Can that rebellious thought be killed? Only a thought can't be avoided or killed, master. What do we do if we cannot kill the person in whose mind the thought was born? It is enough we kill the person about whom the thought is about. In that case, kill Bhairava Don't ask me anything. Just do what I say. Make sure that the dead body would be untraced. Follow orders without any second thought. This is Shankarappa's order This job must be done before sunrise. Only the men who just blindly go for a kill without any questions come with me. It's not easy to stab the person whom we work with. But remember, it is master Shankarappa who is paying us for our living. - Shanku! Why are you here late night? - Bhairava Bhairava What happened? Run away from here as soon as possible Are you drunk? Shankarappa has ordered Mallaiah to kill you He is on way with a gang. Run away, don't get caught. Bhaira You must be hallucinated Why would Shankarappa want me dead? I don't know that. It is true that Mallaiah is coming here to kill you. Enough, I'll go and enquire Shankarappa now Try to understand. You will be dead Mother, make him understand. Wait, I'll go and enquire. Bhairava, we don't need reasons now. We need our life. He is a powerful man. Who knows what strikes in his mind? Listen to me Bloody, he escaped! Geetha ma'am Geetha ma'am What happened? Why are you here at this time? Ma'am, master Shankarappa has ordered Mallaiah to kill Bhairava. You must stop your father somehow. Where is Bhairava? Geetha ma'am is at Bairappa temple. Come fast, she wants to talk to you. Mother, I'll go and find what's the matter. You don't leave this place at any cost Take care, mom. Okay Bhairava. You don't worry about me. Cover yourself with this blanket. You won't be recognised. - Let's go - Be careful, my son Bhairava left the village out fear I guess, master His mother is not home too. Master, we searched for him everywhere. Geetha is missing. I want his dead body here by morning no matter where he is hiding Go find him Malla No one should come to know that Geetha is missing What's happening? I told my dad that I will marry you. Have you gone mad ma'am? What's your status and mine? How could you say that? Because I believed that it is far better to marry you than Nanjamari, Bhairava. You have really gone mad. How could you say like that? Tell your dad that you didn't mean it. I didn't come here to go back, Bhairava If I go back, they will definitely get me married to Nanjamari I'll not marry him at any cost Nanjamari belongs to a reputed family His dad is going to be a minister in future He is a billionaire. I know about them better than you you too know about Nanjamari If you were a father would you get your daughter married to him for only money and wealth? Tell me Bhairava I'll jump and die if forced. But I will not go back. Bhaira Bhaira Shankarappa came to know somehow his men are on the way What are you thinking? Leave this place now, immediately Find him wherever he is and kill him. Master, we could not find them. I should not hear again that they are missing. Our servant Bhairava took my daughter Geetha by force. Before you come to know from other sources I came here to tell you Hey! Did he kidnap her or she ran away with him? Don't you know how to behave? A bloody slave kidnapped king's daughter It is an insult to all of us. Let's search for them as a team from this very moment. Thank God, we escaped No. We escaped for a moment, that's it. This is the place where even eagles work for them and Escaping from here is a day dream What to do now? I don't know. Where to go now? I don't know. Are you angry on me, Bhairava? Angry on you? I can't even think of getting angry on you. Then, how can I think of love? Sleep now, you are tired I can feel your love, Bhairava. But you are not realising it. "The day I saw you first," "I lost myself" "Next time when I saw you" "I was dumbstruck" "Third time, out of blush" "I felt unconsciouses" "Gradually," "I fell in love" "This love is a new experience" "A feel good emotion" "It is is feel good emotion" "This love is a new experience" "The moment I saw you first, I could not even wink" "Next time when I saw you" "I could not breath" "I saw you again, I lost myself" "Gradually" "I fell in love" "This love is a new experience" "A feel good emotion" "This love is a new experience" "A feel good emotion" "An existence of heaven in a hell and comfortness in fire" "is a possibility only in love" "Let's join our hands and bind our hearts" "Let's erase our fate" "and spend the rest of our lives together" "This love is a new experience" "A feel good emotion" Didn't you sleep all night? I was thinking all night. I'm unable to understand what to do. No matter how much we think, some things won't happen as per our wish. They just happen as per fate. I'm very hungry. Come with me. I've been doing it for the first time in my life. It is very thrilling. Bhairava! "Bhairava Geetha... Bhairava Geetha" "Bhairava Geetha... Bhairava Geetha" "Bhairava Geetha... Bhairava Geetha" "Bhairava Geetha... Bhairava Geetha" Shh! Hey, let's go there. "Bhairava Geetha... Bhairava Geetha" "Bhairava Geetha" Geetha ma'am, come this side. Hey! Stop guys! It can collapse any time. Geetha ma'am, careful. - "Geetha... My Bhagavad Gita" - Damn! "Bhairava Geetha... Bhairava Geetha" "Gita... My Bhagavad Gita" Geetha ma'am That is my father's hometown Let's go - Dear! Bring some water. - Okay. Here, have it. Wash your face with the water in the tank. That's my son. He was killed in the fights for master. By the way, why are you here? This is my father's hometown. Is it? What's your father's name? Bharani Veeranna Are you the son Veeranna who used to work for Shankarappa? Yes. She did not want to get married, so she ran away from home. Your dad was a fighter, not a weak person to die. Where is mom? I kept her at a safe place. You should have brought her. Shankarappa's men are patrolling every village. It's very risky to come out. - Let the issue cool down. - Okay. There is a well out there, everyone baths in that You are tired. Take bath and rest. Shall I ask something? Yes, Geetha ma'am. Why do you call me 'Geetha ma'am' after so much happened? Call me Geetha. Look, don't call me Geetha ma'am. Call me Geetha! Do it. Geetha Hey Bhairava, I told you what I feel about you. You too tell me what you feel about me. Tell me. Come on, tell me. Geetha, I fell in love with you at first sight. But what's my status and what's yours? After spending time with you, I understood your nature and loved you more. But you are from rich family. Now that I came to you, Stop thinking about my rich family. Do what you feel in your heart right now. What are you thinking about? "Play with your hands" "The body is waiting to make influence" "My fingers showcasing it's talent in your fingers" "Seductive drum making Eros sound in the heart of aphrodite" "Play with your hands" "Clothes getting tightened" "Why these clothes behave mischievous?" "Arms are getting hotter" "Why these arms behave mischievous?" "Let's open the closed doors" "Let's write light onto darkness" "Let's indulge in pleasure to the core" "Play with your hands" "Play with your hands" "It is a lustgame" "Oh body parts, stop your games" "Hurricane has touched the depths" "of naval and underarms" "When the body drench in sweat" "will it not the clouds envy?" "Innocent lower lip is biting upper lip" "Play with your hands" "Play with your hands" "My fingers showcasing it's talent in your fingers" "Youthfulness became youthful. Barren land is now emitting fragrance" I pity you sometimes Bhairava. Because, even animals fight to survive till their last breath. But people like you take slavery for generations... and are living in bondage without being aware of it. Bhairava Shankarappa'smen are searching for you from to town to town. I am scared, I will bring mom. I will come with you. No Geetha, you better stay here. Don't know when Shankarappa's men can attack. It will be difficult to escape if you are with me. Be careful, I'll be waiting for you - Let's go - Okay. Speak up Speak up now If you don't speak up, I'll slit your throats, burn you to ashes. Let's see if they speak up after he dies. Mallana, I don't know anything. I swear on Bairappa, I don't know, master. Everyone who went behind him would face this same situation and they should know it. I will tell you where Lakshma'amma is Master, please leave them. I beg you Bring this filthy birth along! Please spare my son, master. He hasn't done anything wrong. My husband gave his life for you, spare my son for his sake. He did not die for me for free. I fed him everyday, paid him every month. You people are meant to die for me. Is there no value for my husband's life? Your son betrayed the one who fed him. Speak up Where is he? Speak up - Speak up. - Stop it How would she understand our pain if you beat her? How will she know our pain? It's very hot here. No! My fiancee slapped me for slapping your son. - Speak up, you witch! - She's no more, master. Huh? Mother... Mother! Mother... Mother! Bhaira... Shanku... Shanku! Shankarappa and Nanjamari beat her to death. I could not save her, Bhaira. Bhaira... "The one who sang lullaby to me" "The one made swing in her turn saree" "No one should suffer performing" "last rights of such a mother" "O mother, you are my world" "Tell me mother, why did you leave me?" "I will cry like a baby, if you don't open your eyes" "You used to cry when I had any cut" "You used to clean me, pamper me and sing for me" "My mother is sleeping, don't call her a corpse" "Do I have to cover the mouth of the one who fed me?" "Do I have to send off in palanquin the goddess who gave birth?" "Mother..." "Mother please talk, tell me a story" "Your son is all alone now" "Oven is still hot, the leaf is not cut" "I know you are not dead" Why are you crying? It is not their fault You people are bonded labours to Shankarappa for generations. We are born slaves, we live like slaves and we die like slaves They will fix plough to a calf. These people take life and die on their orders. Have you ever thought why these people are living? Your type of people blindly obey their orders. You live like slaves without any self respect. You'll kill on their orders, you'll burn on their orders. Because of us, these people have become herd of sheeps. Today you suffered, yesterday it was us, tomorrow someone else will. Till you come out of the slavery, this fire will keep you burning. I could not even bare when my mom got hurt by a thorn. They cut her face with a knife, tied her like an animal and beat her to death. I feel rage thinking about the pain my mom suffered. What wrong did I do, which made them torture her to death? I was their slipper when they walked. I watched over them when they slept. I took life when asked me to take out the sword. Geetha! It started because of me, it will end when I die. Have you gone mad, Geetha? Do you think it is all because of you? Do you think it will end with your death? You asking me to get married and coming with me is not the issue. I obeyed every orders without a second thought, That's my mistake. What I did was wrong? Your death is not the answer, Geetha. Killing every man who treat humans as slaves is the right answer. You can't live fighting them, you will lose. I've nothing left to live or lose, Geetha except slavery. Why do you want to fight them if you are going to die? I am realising now, Geetha. Rather than living like a slave, it is better to fight them and die. Geetha, don't think that you are the reason for all this. It was suppose to happen long back. It is happening now because of you Geetha We don't realise the sharpness until sword is in the sheath. We know it when we stab the opposite person. Now, it is the time to show the sharpness. It is the right time. Bhairava He is Irabhadra he is a bomb expert He makes bombs which can turn boulders to dust Bloody Nanjamari molested and killed my daughter in young age. I am living in helplessness He is Krishnappa He is capable of killing four men in a single blow He is Basavanna He is an expert boar hunter He is Kempanna Madesha, Rudrappa, Siddappa, Enktesa They are all waiting from long time for the opportunity to kill them You faced it yesterday today it's me if we keep quite till someone else face the same then our lives will not have any meaning Let us not spare anyone Must kill each and everyone We must beat them such a way that everyone should weep like a baby We must shed blood We must anoint the city with blood "Vande Mataram!" "Vande Mataram!" "Vande Mataram!" "Let this fist of slavery clench" "Let those lord's fear" "Vande Mataram!" "Let the grieving soul hold a weapon" "Let the evildoers heads fall off" "Slavery days are over" "Revolting time has begun" "We hold umbrellas to the rich lord no more" "We chop off heads till end" "We are not a herd of sheep to run away for your roaring" "We are the ferocious tigers who stab your heart" "We are not children to obey on your shoutings" "We are the destructive weapons You wait and watch" "Vande Mataram!" "Let this chain of slavery break." "Let those lord's fear" "They told us to tie lungi and bend down" "They told us to keep scarf in underarms and squat" "Vande Mataram!" "They told us to leave the slipper outside" "Seeing us surrendering they slaved us" "Time has come to clear the black clouds" "A new hope is born in our hopeless life" "Let this fist of slavery clench" "Let those lord's fear" "Let the grieving soul hold a weapon" "Let the evildoers heads fall off" "We must get freedom" "We must get freedom" "Does the lords have thick skin?" "Is his bones and muscles made of steel?" "Vande Mataram!" "If he stab him he will die instantly" "If he realises this He will correct himself" "Bhairava incarnated as Bhargava to wage war" "He is going to create a chaos" "When we wage war" "You all will learn a lesson" "When we wage war" "You all will learn a lesson" "Vande Mataram!" "Vande Mataram!" "Vande Mataram!" "Vande Mataram!" Bloody Bhairava! Provoking everyone against us Just because slaves got united against me I am not going to get scared Wait and watch I'll chop off the heads of all those revolting dogs Flame in their hearts may be a tiny one, Shankarappa if we don't extinguish that flame now it will grow into wildfire and burns entire forest Wild fire has no mercy, Shankarappa Whether it's a tiger or a deer... it will burn them to ashes Shankarappa... I've told Nanjamari... to extinguish that flame Bring out everyone from their homes We searched everywhere No one is here, all have escaped No one is here They were ready to face us and fight Is this your bravery? Why are you all hiding? Come out. Bloody slaves Surrender Bhairava to me or else I will burn down your homes Why you came alone? Where are you hiding that witch? Bring her to me What are you waiting for? Chop off everyone Hey Shankarappa! Nanjamari came to our town thinking we will bow down to him We beat them to hell If you and your men come in our way I came here to warn you that this will happen We all have decided we will settle down in our villages Don't come in our way You will be held responsible if you raise a sword Not even a single soul should be killed by you If not... Your dead body will be found between these dead bodies Before you treat anyone as slaves, look at these dead bodies I will make you pee One more thing, Shankarappa Your daughter voluntarily came with me, I didn't take her Now we are in love Forget about her This is your last chance for you too We have been slaves for these bloody fellows till now Correct your mistake now and join me Or else keep you swords at home, work in fields with your wives and children If in case, your swords come between my sword and their heads I will not hesitate to kill you all Chenmallappa, what brings you here? There is an important matter for you. You will not say no at any cost We planned to assassin Shankarappa, two years back You dad and Shankarappa hid themselves in bushes Shankarappa told your dad to cover his blanket and run We mistook your dad to Shankarappa and killed him You are confessing to us that you killed our friend! Can you walk away from here alive? A smart person will think of the reason behind the death, not the killer Come to the point Bhairava, spirit is not enough to kill a strong enemy a strong support is required An enemy knows the weakness of a person better than his wife I've been waiting for ten years to kill Shankarappa He is escaping death every time If your courage and my experience join hands, we can shed blood What's your decision? Let us presume, we kill Shankarappa What next? What else you expect? We will be the lords of this land This war is not for winning power This war is to end the power play If I kill Shankarappa with your help, tomorrow you will try to overpower me We don't need another landlord One more thing Leave your men on their own, from now on If you try to rule them Your head will fall next to Shankarappa's head I came to know about the humiliation you faced by those slaves We must eradicate him who built people against us and his people Dogs should not snatch food in a fight between a tiger and a loin If we keep our egoism at this time Those bloody slaves will burn our throne that is why I called you here Let us join hands and double our power Let us deal our issues after we kill him But now, a lion should join another lion His followers and his praisers are all under my radar. What shall we do now? His death should be memorable For generations to come These slaves should live and die slaves keeping his death in their minds Our enemies should be reminded of his death They are flirts who fool and make girls pregnant and ditch But our Bhairava can wage war for you You are very fortunate in this matter Did you hear any sound? Huh? Probably, that bloody dog Hmm... By the way, Who proposed first? You or him? In fact, it is enough for the two to fall in love Need not express love in words Expressing love in words is not love at all Isn't it? Run Run Geeta Have you left me all alone? Hey Bhairava This is the blood of Somiah I didn't kill that witch yet I will enjoy and kill her before you. I dare you to come and stop that. Come! I will not question your actions I'll not ask, why you ran away with that slave I thought an educated girl will be of help... but you ran away like mad! I beared you on my shoulders and raised you but you have kicked me on heart. You ruined my reputation for sake of them. You think they all changed?! Once Bhairava is stabbed in heart... they will become my slaves. To forget what has happened you must die Your pride has brought you death. As he see that body, to kill us he will think we will be in village, so he will come this way, with his men We will wait here than in village, and surround him when he comes Let's kill that witch in front of him and then kill him Go now! Bhairava! Geeta! Don't cry Bhairava You proved slavery is not without but within Bhairava and Geetha got married and set an example for everyone What needs to be destroyed in this world are the unnecessary wars but not the good example this couple has set Rich people's rule should be abolished and poor people should be uplifted The principle of Vande Mataram should be made true.
