Now all your friends hate me. So what? Fuck them. They're just shit. I'm such a loser. No, you're not. I'm like nothing. No, I want you to shut up about that. I don't know why you're friends with me. Well, because I am, that's why. Look, I'm the big fucking loser. I was the one blowing some dickhead for a hit. That did look kind of gross. Yeah, it tasted gross. Ew. I don't think I could ever do that. I'd be way too embarrassed. Why? It's like a power thing. You're in charge. Oh, you really looked like you were in charge. No, I'm serious. Like, the guy can't come unless you let him. I don't know. Well, you know, someday you're going to do it. I'll probably screw that up too. Well, just practice before. Practice? Yeah. Like how? Like on anything. Like a banana. Try not to leave teeth marks. Was that how you learned? No. Tell me. I was at summer camp when I was 10. You were 10 when you did it? Do you want to listen to this or not? So I was at summer camp and there was this counselor. He was older, like 17. He was always telling me that I was pretty and shit. So one day he tells me to come to the pantry to like help him get paper plates. And it's really small in there, so we're like pressed up against each other. Was he really hot? He was okay. He looked kind of like that guy in the movie "Se7en." Brad Pitt? No, the weird killer guy. Oh. Ew. Okay, anyways, so he's pressed up against me and I can feel it and it's like huge. And then he just looks at me and pushes... He puts his hand on top of my head and pushes me down to my knees in front of him. Did you scream? No, he was really gentle. And then he unzips his jeans and just takes it out. And I was like, Whoa. What Was it like? It was like this big fat snake like staring me in the face. Oh my God. And he's like waving it around and tapping it on my nose and shit. And he puts it against my lips. I'm like, I don't know what to do, but there's like nowhere to go, you know? And he just keeps pushing, and I think at some point I opened my mouth to say something like, Get that smelly thing out of my face, and he just shoved it in. Did you choke? Yeah, because it Was huge. My mouth was wide open like this. Like... Oh wow. And I was starting to turn blue because I couldn't breathe. And he tells me to breathe through my nose and I do. And snot starts coming out of my nose. Oh my God. But it wasn't funny. I was like blowing my nose all over his dick. And he's like pumping it in and out, back and forth in my mouth and grabbing my hair. Did you... oh my God. Did you scream? No. He told me a couple of times actually to get my teeth out of the way, but like where the fuck were they supposed to go? you know? Yeah. I mean like there wasn't any room in there for his dick and my teeth. Oh. So he just keeps pumping and grabbing my hair. And at some point I look up and I can see that he's going to come, because, you know, guys look really stupid before they come. Mm-hmm. Like how? Like, their faces get all scrunchy and they look like they're taking a shit or something. Oh my God. So he's doing all this weird shit with his face. Mm-hmm. And all of a sudden there's like this explosion in my mouth and all this hot gooey stuff starts coming out. Did you swallow any of it? Yeah. I swallowed a lot of it because I didn't have a choice. I mean there was like a gallon of it and it just kept coming. And he's like grabbing my head so I couldn't move or anything, right? And like I started coughing and it just started coming out of my nose and the sides of my mouth, like probably my ears. Oh. Did it taste totally gross? It was like... Mom, What the fuck? Who are you talking to? It's Amy. I was talking to Amy. Jesus Christ. It's me, Miss Stewart. Sorry. It's late. Go to sleep, Megan. Sorry, Meg. Sorry. I... I hate it here. I hate it so much. I have to get out of here. Where would you go? I don't care. Well, if you go anywhere, I'm going with you. Really? Yeah. You're my best friend. Really? I don't know what I'd do without you. Well, you're my best friend too, Amy. Really? You're my only real friend. Megan, go to sleep now! Maybe we'll run away together, go far away somewhere like Texas or something. Why Texas?

Hello, my name's Amy Herman, and today's January 13th, 2007, and this is my video diary. This is my room. As you can see, it's very neat and clean, because I believe cleanliness is next to godliness. This is Mr. Rupert. He's in charge of all the rest of the animals and he makes sure that they all behave when I'm gone. I love him, but he's not my favorite bear. My favorite bear is Billy Bear. He's not here anymore. This is my best friend Megan. We go on all kinds of crazy adventures. We're pretty wild together. We're like sisters. I just love her. As you can see, I live in a pretty nice house. We live in an area called Sherman Oaks. If you're not from Los Angeles, you have no idea what I'm talking about. But there it is. This Is my Mom Louise. Amy, What are you doing? It's my video diary. You want to tape me rushing around, trying to get dinner ready? Sure. It's real life. So is doing your homework while I'm doing this. Mom's a real estate agent as well as being a mom. She's probably crabby because she didn't sell a house today. Amy. This is my cat Charlie. He's really old. He's actually older than me, which makes him like 100 in cat years. That's really old. This is my backyard. This is our barbecue. When the weather's nice, we'll barbecue and my parents will invite some friends over for a party. My dad's not here. He works long hours, but he always makes sure to be here on my birthday and other important holidays. Well, that's my house. Thanks for joining me on the tour. Bye. Hello, hot chick. Hi, Skaterdude.

Hey, can you tilt your webcam down a little? Why? I don't know. Just because. Oh my God, all guys are the same. What? I'm not putting on a show for you, freak. No! I didn't mean it like that. Then what? I don't know. I'm... nothing. I'm sorry. Don't worry about it. How's that? Mm, much better. Nice outfit. Thanks. So your cam is broken, huh? Yeah, my fucking dog chomped on it.

I was at that party for four hours, buddy. If you were there, then you're the invisible man. I looked like an idiot. Well, I thought you looked great. And How would you know? Because I Was there. Okay. If you were there, then what was I wearing? Uh, well, you had on a really sexy little jean skirt and a black top with gold trim and, um, black high-heeled kind of sandals. And I think you had a butterfly clip in your hair. You were there. Yeah, I told you. Well, then why didn't you come up to me? I saw you looking around. I figured you were probably looking for me. Yeah, I was. And you looked so great. I mean you looked incredible. I totally felt my heart skip a beat when I saw you. I guess I just wimped out. So you watched me? Yeah. Kind of creepy, huh? No. It's kind of nice. Yeah, I saw you talking with your friends. You're really popular. I didn't want to barge in and mess things up. You're shy. Mm, sometimes. It's okay. I get shy too sometimes. Hmm. You seem like you're always in control. No. Sometimes I just don't know what to do, so I usually do something stupid. Hey well, Stupid is my middle name. Anyway, I am sorry I didn't talk to you last night. It's okay. I understand. You do? Yeah. But I do wish I could have met you. Yeah.

Well, I bet he can't skateboard. You're jealous. Of him? Nah. Yes, you are! Admit it! Why would I be jealous of Matt Damon? I don't know. You tell me. Well, maybe because he gets to spend time with you today and I don't. Well, you could if you ask me. Okay, then I'm asking you. Asking me what? Wow, you don't make this easy, do you? Hey, I'm worth fighting for. Yeah, you are. Thank you. So, Megan, after your date with Matt Damon, would you like to meet up and maybe get some ice cream or something? Yes, I would. Cool.

You don't think you're cute? I do. I'm all right. Mm, I think you're sexy. I think you're one sexy girl. Was that you in the video? What, that security video? That was some old dude. So you didn't see her there? No. I think maybe she skipped out with that guy before I got there. You know, she seems kind of flaky. She wouldn't do that. She would have told me. So you two are really close, huh? Yeah, we are. It's funny, you don't seem like the kind of girl she would hang with. What do you mean? You know What I mean. Just look at yourself. You know exactly what I mean. No, I don't. You just said I was sexy. Then you're stupid too. You'll believe anything, won't you? I think you know where she is. Trying to change the conversation won't change the facts, Amy. What facts? That you're fat, that you have no friends, that no one finds you attractive. I have friends. You have one friend who left and didn't tell you where she was going because she didn't want you tagging along. No, that's not true. Would you like to have friends, Amy? Would you like to sleep with something besides your teddy bear? Shut up. Mm-hmm. Do you hug your teddy bear, Amy, and pretend he's some guy you like who's never going to talk to you? shut up. Because you're some loser who won't spread her legs? You don't know anything about me. You don't know who I am. I know exactly who you are, Amy. Megan told me all about you... How pathetic you are, how you follow her around like a little puppy. You're like a big joke to her. What Did you do to Megan? Nothing. Nothing she didn't do with 100 guys before. Today on Missing, new revelations in the case of Megan Stewart, the North Hollywood teenager who disappeared over two weeks ago. Police were given a statement by 14-year-old Amy Herman, a close friend of the missing girl. What did you tell the police? I just told them about someone Megan was chatting with online. What's this person's name? This man before? Had She met with I'm sorry, but that information is vital to the ongoing investigation. Well, now that you've come forward, do you fear for your own life? All right, that's it. No more questions for now. We have confirmed that Amy Herman mentioned a man named Josh who apparently met Megan Stewart in a chat room using the nickname Skaterdude. A complete chronology of the investigation We'll be back after these messages. Of some of the places Let me take you on a tour Megan and I would go to. I keep thinking I'll see her somewhere. I keep hoping I do, at least. This is a diner. We always used to come here after school. What are you doing? Get That camera out of my face. I'm not recording you guys. I'm making a video diary for myself. About how you messed up Megan's life, huh? No... You know it's because of you that she's not here, right? That's not true. What are you going to do, sell this? Are you going to sell this to the news? No, I'm... I'm not going to sell this to anyone. You know what? Stay the fuck out of my face, bitch. As you can see I'm very well liked. Hey! You know that this is all your fault, right? You think you're hot shit because she spent every waking moment with you? - No, I... - Is That What you think? I don't think that. Fuck. She loved me! And I... I loved her back. I loved her so much! And now she's gone because of you! This is all your fault and I can't fix it. There's nothing I can fucking do. Get the fuck out of my face. This is all your fault. Megan and I used to come under this bridge and just talk about stuff. I remember one time when it just started to rain and then it started to pour. All of a sudden the entire river was flooded. We didn't want to tell anyone about it. We thought people might think we were stupid. I guess we kind of were. Megan's so adventurous. She's not afraid to try things and she doesn't care what other people think about her. I wish I was more like her. I'm going to show you something. This is Billy Bear. I've had him since I was like five. Three years ago my mom wanted me to get rid of him because he was all ragged, but I just couldn't. So I keep him here and I can visit him whenever I want. People keep saying how this experience is supposed to help me grow up, but... I don't understand that. If anything, it's making me not want to grow up. There's so much weirdness out there. I'd just... I'd just rather stay here with Billy. Who is this? I think you know. Josh? You have a big mouth. I didn't say you kidnapped Megan. No. You just said you think I did. Well, if you didn't, you have nothing to worry about. I don't have anything to worry about. They can't find me. You can set up free screen names anywhere. What do you want from me? I want you to shut your big fucking mouth. And if you still feel like yakking to the police, I may have to pay you a visit or your mom. I'm watching you, Amy. Tonight a special Megan is Missing reenactment based on analysis of the original security camera footage. We must warn you that some material may be too intense for younger viewers. Well, we're filming the reenactment of an abduction and we're doing it actually on the exact location where the girl was abducted. You want to find the truth and we believe an accurate reenactment in the same location might bring about some clues that the police really haven't been able to touch on themselves. I... I just... I think this is so important. And I want to do anything I could do to help out. I mean I can't even imagine that this happened. It is difficult playing someone as awful as this, but you look past your personal feelings and just try to make it real for the audience. When I was a lot younger I spent a lot of time on the internet. It's not a safe space. As much as you feel safe in your own home, you're not safe. And now a Megan is Missing exclusive reenactment. Hey, Mom, it's me. I'm going to go to the store and get some groceries for breakfast. So I'll see you soon. Bye. You're trespassing. Come with me. Stop! No, please! Please! Stop! Stop! The brutal abduction of a beautiful young girl. We'll be right back. It's been three weeks now. I can feel the people searching for Megan are starting to give up. They're not trying anymore and it's really hard to get volunteers. I think that they might think she's dead. Maybe I do too. Tonight a shocking twist in the case of Megan Stewart. The missing girl's best friend, Amy Herman, has now vanished. Are the girls the victims of the same kidnapper or have they simply run away together? Detective Jon Simonelli had this to say. Obviously the coincidence of both girls, who were friends, disappearing is enormous. We're working all possible scenarios at this time. A baffling case that grows more bizarre by the hour. We'll be right back. It has been two days since the disappearance of 15-year-old Amy Herman and 23 days since her best friend Megan Stewart was abducted behind a local diner. Their friends have started a campaign to persuade everyone to tie pink ribbons on trees as a symbol of hope. We're doing this pink ribbon campaign to let Megan know that we love her and we miss her. And hopefully it'll make whoever took her, you know, feel bad and let her go. Search parties continue to examine the wooded area surrounding the two girls' homes for any leads as to their whereabouts. Earlier today I spoke with Amy's parents. We'd like to thank all the volunteers that have spent so many hours searching for Amy. We believe in our hearts that she's well and that she will be returned to us. Princess, if you can... If you can hear me, we love you and we're praying for you. Chief, we've got something here. Frank, get the camera. Get the camera, Frank. Tell those guys to stop. Hold up. Hold up right there. Help!
