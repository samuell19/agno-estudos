[Mr. Thursby] You know, I never noticed it before, but there is a likeness. [Mrs. Thursby] Arthur! Go and stand beside your uncle here. Well, we haven't got too much time. [Mrs. Thursby] There! How can you say such a thing? Oh, well. Nevertheless he was a great lawyer, Edith. They still remember him. The name isn't going to be a handicap to Roger. -He'll make his own name. Won't you? -[Roger] I hope so. -[car beeping] -Ah, there's the taxi. Come on. We don't want to miss that train. Roger Thursby. Roger Thursby, I do hereby call you to the bar and do publish you barrister. Oh, no, you take it. It's been a lovely day, Roger. It's been a wonderful day. Sure you're not too tired, both of you? -Not a bit. -We should go home. We're very proud of you. Aren't we, Arthur? We shall. Good heavens. We haven't got too much time either. Oh, haven't we? I know you two want to have a word together. So I shan't be a moment. -Well, don't be too long, Edith. -[Mrs. Thursby] I shan't. You know what women are in front of the mirror. -Yes, Dad. -You do? Well, yes, of course you do. Well, Roger, it's been a great day. In more senses than one. I don't mind telling you now the times when your mother and I wondered if we'd be able to see it through. -Yes. I know, Dad. -You do? I always hoped you didn't. The little money we were able to put aside for your education seemed ample enough at the time. Since then the value of money has gone down when everything else used to go up. -You both have been wonderful, Dad. -Nonsense, my boy. It's been well worth it. And now that you're a barrister, all those worries are behind us. Well, of course it'll take a little time to get going, Dad. Yes, but with your brain and the Thursby name why, you're off to a flying start. -[Mrs. Bristow] Bring more, won't you? -[man] Well, we'll see to that. Hello, Mrs. Bristow. -What's this? The new top flat? -That's right, Mr. Thursby. Your laundry's come back. It's on your bed. Ah, jolly good. -Everyone right at home? -Yes. Thank you, Mrs. Bristow. Ah, there you are. -How did the conducted tour go? All right? -Fine. The old man sent his regards. -Indeed? -Aha. That's reassuring. He always looks at me as though I've just dispatched debutants to Buenos Aires. Oh, rot. It's just your guilty conscience. Ouch. What's all that about? Just something to mark the occasion. It's all fixed up. I've spoken to Alec. Come to Chambers in the morning and meet Grimes. Oh, really? I shan't be there myself, got a case in Westminster, -but Alec will show you the ropes. -Fine. So with Grimey boy and myself to guide your first faltering steps you're virtually assured of a glorious legal future. -Worth a drink? -Sounds all right. -Well. -Cheers. -Tell me, Henry. -Not bad. How does it work out? Financially, I mean. Do you actually make anything? Good heavens, yes. Had a three-guinea brief week before last. Week before last? He was out of town by the time I got there and paid my hotel, cost me a fiver. But that's ridiculous. He may be all right for you, but what about the chaps who haven't got any allowance? It's rather like being aground on a sand bank. Either you end up a total wreck or the tide floats you off. It's a toss-up, which happens first? Unless you're brilliant. You're not brilliant, are you? No. [explosion] [car approaching] What on earth is that? Love at first sight, old boy! Isn't she a beauty? What's it for? Ah, you wait and see. Come on up. You're just in time for launching. Launching? Oh, right! Ha! -Oh, grab another glass, will you? -Yes. There's no doubt that as far as old Charles is concerned, sex has been supplanted by the internal combustion engine. I never knew a fellow who could get so worked up over a couple of big ends. Gosh! Had a bit of a job getting it here. Only just made it. Yes, if your clients of the stocks see you in that they'll look for a new broker. Don't worry. As soon as I strip her and give her a full treatment, you'll be proud to know the girl. And so will they. What's all this in aid of? Roger's coming up. He starts tomorrow. Gosh! Jolly good! -Well, bags of briefs. -Yeah. Here you are, sir. Your brief bag. Oh, thank you very… Oh. Um, well, I'd rather wanted a red one. That'll come later, sir. You start with the blue one. -Well, how do I…? -See, like this. You'll be in a case led by a Q.C. He'll be impressed by how you help him. At the end he'll give you a red bag and you'll give his clerk a guinea. Oh, I see. I expect I shall have to wait a bit for that. We hope not, sir. No, never like that, sir. Take it by the cord. Now, over the shoulder with it with a swing. -Sorry. -That's the idea, sir. Roughly. The whole effect should be a sort of negligee. Oh, right. Well, thank you very much. Not at all, sir. Thank you, sir. By the way, sir, if at the end of seven years you haven't been given a red bag… Yes? Use a suitcase. -Good morning, sir. -Good morning. [Alec] So no chitty for Mr. Grimes. Now don't forget. There's another brief. Good morning. Good morning, sir. My name's Thursby. I'd like to see Mr. Grimes. I have an introduction from Mr. Milroy. We heard all about you. My name's Blair, but everybody calls me Alec. How do you do? -You wanted to come as a pupil? -Right. We'll see if Mr. Grimes can see you before he goes into court. Thank you. [phone ringing] -Excuse me. -Sorry. Hello? Mr. Grimes' clerk speaking. Don't worry, my dear fellow. We'll slap a writ on them before they can say "nolle prosequi". They will do these things. Quick, boy. I'll show him. That's him, sir. I'll call you back later. You forgot your hats and a chitty. Come, or we shall miss him altogether. -Will he see me now? -Might not get another chance for days. Mr. Grimes, sir. -Mr. Thursby. -My dear fellow? -Mr. Thursby. -Oh. How are you, my dear boy? Glad to meet you. -Mr. Milroy spoke about… -Splendid, chap. -How is his arthritis? -Well, I don't know. Give him my very best wishes. Great to have met you. Don't let him get away. Grimes! -Mr. Grimes. -Huh? -Mr. Milroy said… -He's feeling better, you said? I don't know, but he said you might take me as a pupil. Pupil? We might. When were you called? Last Tuesday, actually. Just out of the egg, eh? Mustn't keep the court waiting. -[Grimes yelling] -[car honking] Thank you, my dear fellow. -When do you want to start? -Oh, now. Then come into the court and listen. Good practice for you. [Alec] Any luck, sir? I don't know. He said come into court and listen. Oh! Then he's taking you. You're in. Pick up the details later. Give me the books. Take this to Thursby on to the robing room then bring them to court. [general chattering] Sorry. Sorry. Sorry, sir. Thank you, Greg. -Morning, Jack. -Morning, Sir Oliver. You'll, um-- You'll let me know when I have my own locker? Yes, sir, if I'm still alive. I beg your pardon? Might take a 20 years to get one of them. -Oh, I see. -We've got to get going, sir. Oh, right. Quick, boy. Mr. Hallfield. Find him, quick. Inside, sir. [judge] You say it was the defendant's fault, I suppose, Mr. Grimes? [Grimes] Oh, yes, Lord. Oh, we shall see. -Is the spatial damage agreed? -Except for one item, My Lord. [judge] What is that? A pair of trousers, My Lord. Do you wish to fight the trousers, Mr. Ferrant? They haven't been produced, My Lord. Nor has the bill. -We're prepared to prove the trousers. -Very well. Call the first witness, please. Hm? The official referee, sir, in room 467. Well, don't keep him waiting. Just hold this back, fellow. Cramp's waiting for me. Come along, sir. The court waiting. We mustn't keep them waiting. No sign of Mr. Hallfield yet. Well, find him, my dear fellow. Find him. Your Honour, please, as I submit that in meal or in malt the onus of proof is on the defendant. Why in meal or in malt, Mr. Grimes? -If Your Honour pleases. -[judge] Yes, but why, Mr. Grimes? You're always seeing in meal or in malt and I can't think why. I really can't. It's just a phrase, Your Honour, just a phrase. Well, if you should bust the number of times in the last half hour, Let me see now. They called Pope and Raplin in Queen's Bench Six, sir. No sign of Mr. Hallfield. [Grimes] Oh. Make a note, my dear fellow. -What? -A note. [judge clearing his throat] Sorry, Your Honour. Just arranging with my learned friend, mister… -Thursby. -Thirst. You see, this should be arranged beforehand. Am I to understand to be deprived with the pleasure of hearing your further argument? [Grimes] Only for a very short time. I'm on my feet before Mr. Justice Budley. You are? Oh, I see. The prophetic present. I mustn't keep you. I suppose it's very good of you to have come at all. Much obliged. Keep it simmering, my dear fellow. Tell him the tale. Yes, but what tale? [sighing] Well, Mr. Thornby, now that the wind has dropped, we have to continue. I, um… -Your Honour… -Yes, Mr. Thornby? Um… Could you tell me which side I'm on? Mr. Thornby. You're a learned leader on behalf of the plaintiff, who was saying… Now what was he saying? Oh, yes. Something about in meal or in malt. Perhaps he was admitting that the onus of proof was on the other side. No doubt you'd like to elaborate. -Your Honour… -Yes, Mr. Thornby? I, um… Um… -Your Honour, I… -Yes, I suppose what you say is that the defendants, having admitted that the work was done, it is for them to show that parts of it have not been properly done. Yes, Your Honour. An admirable submission, Mr. Thornby, and very succinctly put. On the other hand, isn't it up to the plaintiff to prove that he has performed the contract? I suppose so, Your Honour. And can you do that without showing that the work was properly done? I suppose not, Your Honour. [judge] You hardly rely on the maxim omnia rite. I never remember how it goes on. Omnia rite et solemniter esse acta praesumuntur. Your Honour. Thank you, Mr. Thursby. Much obliged for that. But you can't hardly rely on it in a case like this. Or can you? I wonder. Tell me, is there a Scott Schedule? A Scott Schedule, Your Honour? I'm afraid there isn't one, Your Honour. Unless my learned friend has something up his sleeve. -And how many items are in dispute? -About 50, Your Honour. Fifty items and no Scott Schedule? This is intolerable. You better put your heads together. I shall rise for ten minutes, after which I shall expect assured that you've reached compromise. Very well. [Roger sighing] Whatever is a Scott Schedule? You're Grimes' pupil, not mine. I thought you might have found out before coming into court. Well, come on. I suppose you've got to settle this somehow. [bell chiming] Hello! I hear from Alec you got a case sooner than you expected. Yes, much sooner. Well done! First day. It's been a record. That's the way to get known. Yes, but what as? Don't worry, you were lucky. -Lucky? -It was old Cramp, wasn't it? He can be pretty awkward when he wants to, huh? -Must have thought you were very green. -I see. Well, he's likely to tear you apart. -Oh. -They don't know why. Look, that'll be your desk over there, and you better have some of this junk. Make sure you look snowed under. Impresses the customers. Quick, sir. Mr. Grimes can see you right away. Come along. Cheer up. [knocking at the door] Mr. Thursby, sir. [Grimes] Mhm. Oh! How are you, my dear boy? How are you? [chuckling] -Well, sit down, would you? -Oh. Thank you, sir. [coughing] Well? Well? What can I do for you? Oh. Alec said that you wanted to see me, sir. I wanted to see you? Do you have any idea what Alec thought I wanted to see you about? Well, I suppose it was about taking me as a pupil. Oh! Yes, you want us to take you as a pupil. Well, I… I thought you had. -This morning. -This morning? Perhaps you remember. I took a case for you. Oh, did you now? It's very kind of you, my dear fellow. Very kind. Thank you very much. -Not at all. -Did we win? Um, well, I think we… We settled. Huh. Did we? Well, quite right. It's always a good thing to do. Never go to law. That's what I always tell them. They will do these things. They will. Well, perhaps it's a good thing for us that they do. Oh, yes. Yes. I think we can take you. Now let's see. You better take some of these things to go on with. That's slander, that's drains, that's a paternity case, yes. Would you believe it? The soldier didn't even tell her his name. They will do these things, my dear fellow. They will. Okay, you better take the lot. You take them home, study them, let me have an opinion. -Good practice for you. -[knocking at the door] -Yes? -Mr. Hanford, sir. Must have a word on Price and Wiggins. So he left until the last moment, did he? Oh, very well. Goodbye, my dear fellow. -Listen, never hesitate, ever. -Okay, sir. Thank you. Any queries, always at your disposal. Thank you very much. Goodbye. Hanford. What is the trouble? What is it? Yeah. Yes, yes. Yes. Yes. All fixed up, sir. Lift up. It seems like it. Well, I'm glad, sir. I am really. It'll be good to have a Thursby in these chambers. -I know your uncle well, of course. -Thank you, Alec. It's just a question of the pupillage phase. If you let me have your check for 100 guineas. -Oh. -Ten guineas for me. -That's the usual fee for the clerk. -Oh, yes, of course. Oh, any time will do, sir. Within reason. [laughing] -Thank you, Alec. -Indeed, sir. [huffing] What an extraordinary man. You know, I don't think he even knew who I was. Give me an opinion, my dear fellow. Study, sleep with them, wrap your fish and chips in them. Give me an opinion. What did he give you? Ah, drain. Days of my youth. I've done them all, my dear fellow. He's off again, sir. Better go with him. Oh, dear. After him, my dear fellow, after him! Hey! [chuckling] Henry? Henry? [sighing] [Mrs. Bristow] Mr. Thursby! Mr. Thursby, quick! Mr. Thursby, telephone. Long distance. Thank you, Mrs. Bristow. [huffing] [door closing] Hello? Oh! Hello, Mother! We just had to ring, darling, to find out how your first day went. You have? He's been in court already! What happened, Roger? What did you say? What's that? -Yes? -What did he say? He said "Yes, Your Honour." And what else, darling? -Oh. -Well? And other things. Let me speak to him. Hello, Roger. This is Father speaking. Well done, my boy. What was the case? Oh. A building dispute? Well, will it be in the papers? You mean you hope not. You've got to get used to being in the papers, you know? Anyway, I told you you'd be off to a flying start. -Congratulations. -Mine too! Your mother sends hers too. Goodbye, my boy. Goodbye, Roger. [hanging up phone] -Hello. -Oh. Hello. I've just been up to greet the new tenant. Oh, really? -What's he like? -Oh, dull. Not your cup of tea. Ready to feed? -If you like. -Good. Come on. -[Roger] What's his name? -[Henry] Who? [Roger] Well, the new tenant. [Henry] Oh, Smith. [Roger] That sounds dull, huh? -Morning, Alec. -Good morning, sir. Beautiful morning. Sharp wind, though. Very treacherous. They've got Mrs. Grimes in bed again with bronchitis. Keep telling her you can't be too careful but they will do these things, they will. Well, what do we got? Ten o' clock, Watson-Watson and Doncaster here. -Yes. -And in Court 4, Artcastle and the Crowning Glory Home Perm. We went bold, didn't we? -That's right, sir. -Yes. After the adjournment before judging chambers. Then you're in bankruptcy. And there's a judgement summons come in, sir. Would it be alright to give that to Mr. Thursby? Well, can't Mr. Marshall do it? Mr. Marshall will be with Mr. Hallfield at the Old Bailey. Oh, then give it to Mr. Thursby. He's got to start sometime. What are you on now? Judgement summons. Ah! A JS, eh? And I really know about judgement summons. I've looked up every case and every rule that can possibly apply. I know exactly how I handle a defendant in every question I should ask. In fact, I'll have him to take mine and be left alone with one. [door opening] Good morning, Thursby. Marshall. There's a judgement summons come in. Just get down and do it. Will you, my dear fellow? -Who, me? -Yes. Nothing to it. You've got plenty of time to get there. Much obliged. [laughing] Much obliged. Well. -Had a bit of luck. -Yes. Anything the matter? No. You don't think something could crop up that I hadn't thought about, do you? Well, um… [clearing his throat] It's just possible, I suppose, but with all the rules and cases you swotted up, I don't think anything could surprise you, do you? No. Hey! You'll need these. And try and look confident. Good luck. -You'll pay five shillings a month. -[lawyer] Very well. -Very much obliged, Your Honour. -[man] Castle Furniture Company and Coons. -You've got everything? -Yes. No need to worry. As far as I'm concerned, this is an open-and-shut case. Once I get him in the box there's no way he can do out of it. [judge] Come along, Mr. Coons. Go and see if he is outside. [man] Albert Coons! Albert Coons! There's no sign of him. Where is he? What are you going to do? [judge] Mr. Thursby. [clearing his throat] -The defendant doesn't seem to be here. -He must be. [judge] No must about it, Mr. Thursby. What do you want me to do? -Um… -Ask to have him fined. Would Your Honour fine him? What good would that do? It's your client who wants the money. Yes, Your Honour. -If he doesn't pay, he goes to prison. -What? If he doesn't pay, he goes to prison. Your Honour, if he doesn't pay, he goes to prison. Oh, come, before he goes to prison, you have to prove means. And you can't prove means unless he's here to be cross-examined. Have to prove means. -Not in the case of a fine. -[Roger] You sure? [clerk] Of course I'm sure. Not in the case of a fine. Nonsense. He can't be fined unless you can prove he has the means to pay it. If he's not here to be cross-examined, you can't prove means, you're back where you started. -There you are. -It's wrong. Well, you tell him. Well, what would you like me to do, Mr. Thursby? Um… Ask for a 271. -What do you say? -Ask for a 271. Would Your Honour grant a 271? A 271? What on earth is that? I don't know, Your Honour. Then you can hardly expect me to grant it. Summon's dismissed. -Look, sir. I must right… -You learn in time not to upset judges. Meanwhile I suppose other people have to pay for your experience. Good day. Sighing. -Hello. -Hello. I say, I had a real stroke of luck today. I picked up that crown wheel and pinion at the first car brokers I went to. Got a couple of half shafts as well. You know, I might have spent months looking for them. They haven't made them since '32, not for my old bus. Course it's going to be a bit of a job putting them together, but… I'm not boring you, am I? Frankly, yes. -What's the matter with you? -Oh, nothing. Where's Henry? Just missed him. Hit the dash. Some client or other. He told me to tell you he might be late in. Big legal stuff. There's just one more question that I could put to you. Yes? -Do you work on Saturdays? -No, dove. -Good. Neither do I. -Why? -Most weekends I go home. -Oh. Not so good. Oh, and by the way, I happen to say you were a barrister, and daddy said he'd never heard of you. That's all right. I've never heard of him. He's a solicitor. Oh, my dear young lady. Is he? He's a partner in Watson-Watson and Doncaster. -What? -In Lincoln's Inn. Oh, yes, I know. We get loads of work from them. You know, you really are a most attractive girl. I never asked a counsel's opinion on that subject. Hey. Look out. [chuckling] You've been such a help, Henry. Strange your father's never heard of me. I'm sure he will. Yes. Well, what would you like me to do now? Well, there's a lamp here that doesn't seem to work properly. [Henry] Right. Oh, I say, these are quite something. Wow! Are these you? Don't they look like me? Well, yes. I mean, more so. Must have been quite a party when these were taken. It's my job, stupid. I model. Do you? I own a box Brownie. -Are you going to mend this lamp or not? -Yes, of course. This man you share rooms with, is he a barrister too? Yes, and a pupil. He just started. -Nice! -Yeah, but dull. The studious type. Not your cup of tea. That looks alright. Let's try it. Here we are. Blast! -I think you've fused everything. -I'll say I have. -You don't have matches? -On the table, by the window. [objects clanking] What have you done? I've hit the floor. -Here, take my hand. -[panting] -Oh! -Oh! [Henry laughing] [Sally] You're not being so helpful now, Mr. Marshall. [Henry laughing] Not to worry. Just part of the credit squeeze. [Sally] And I hardly know you. Funny man. [both laughing] -It's really not all that… -Sh. You really must go. You've been sweet, but you can't stay any longer. -Weekend. -I'm going home. Lunch tomorrow. -Phone me. -Right. -Good night. -Good night. Ah! Well. How'd it go? It didn't, I lost. Lost? But how? What happened? The one thing I hadn't bargained for, the fellow didn't show up. You should've had him fined and asked for a 271. If he didn't pay, he'd be arrested and brought to court to explain why. That's exactly what I did do. It was the judge. He'd never even heard of a 271. [laughing] Got to be ready for that. Judges don't know everything. -How'd you get on with your client? -Oh! Very interesting. It wasn't a waste of the evening. Could lead to something. -Good night. -Good night. [sighing] -Henry? -Mm-hmm? So far I've been on my feet twice. First time I didn't know my brief. Second time, I didn't know my law. -So what? You need experience. That's all. -Yes. As soon as I stand up everything I've learned seems to vanish. Hate to think what'll happen if I get as far as examining a witness. My dear fellow, it's just a matter of confidence. Don't put things in your own witnesses' mouth. In other words, don't ask leading questions, get a move-on and always keep the old judge sweet. For example, I've got a divorce case tomorrow. A petition on grounds of cruelty. Come along, see how it's done. It's quite easy. I shall have the old trout in the box and then carefully avoiding more leading questions, I shall ask her… Mrs. Potter, did your husband ever hit you? One moment. Please don't lead on essential matters. As Your Lordship pleases. Mrs. Potter, did he or did he not hit you? [judge] Really. That's just as bad. With respect, she could have said yes or no. So she could to your first question. It was nonetheless leading. Very well, My Lord. Mrs. Potter, how often did these assaults take place? That is not a near leading question, it is a double question, and in my view, a most improper one. The witness has not yet said that her husband hit her. Well, madam, did he hit you? Mr. Marshall. There must be some limit to this. Your Lordship told me to ask a question and when I do, he complains. That's a most improper observation. Very well, My Lord. I apologise. Then let me suggest that you ask the witness how her husband treated her. Thank you, My Lord. Mrs. Potter, how did your husband treat you? Like a slave. [Henry] Yes. In what way? Well, in every way. Well, could you enumerate some of these ways? Enume… what? Give some examples. It was always happening. -What was? -Him treating me like that. Like what? How did he treat you? Something terrible. We weren't there, Mrs. Potter. You must tell us about it. What was going on all the time. What was? [Mrs. Potter] What he did. Just tell us one thing he did. So many. [Henry] Then it should be easy to think of one. Can you not tell His Lordship one single thing your husband did? [Mrs. Potter] Well… there was that time at Christmas. Yes? Or was it Easter? Well, what happened at Easter then, Mrs. Potter? You want me to tell the judge? That is what I've been trying to persuade you to do for considerable time. Well… What was you saying again? Something happened at Easter. Oh, I don't think I'd like to tell the judge that. Mr. Marshall, after nearly half an hour, we have the witness's name, address and little else. If Your Lordship allowed me to ask what I first wanted, would've been over by now. Equally had I allowed the evidence as you've been endeavouring to do. However, you are not in this court for that purpose. You might welcome an opportunity to come before another judge. Remember, always keep the old boy sweet. Your Lordship is extremely considerate. I shall be glad to accept your kind suggestion. The case will be adjourned for that purpose. Absolutely impossible. -You were lucky to get it adjourned. -The woman's a complete moron. [laughing] Hello. I'm… I'm so sorry. -That's all right. -I had no idea. Oh, sorry. Please excuse, I have someone… Hello, Alec. -For goodness sake! Take those things off! -I think it suits me. Don't you? Yes, you look jolly decorative, but I'm convincing, thank goodness. A barrister dressed like you would defeat the course of justice. -Isn't justice blind, Henry? -Yes, but judges aren't. Now come on, what I need is a very stiff reviver. -You can't imagine what I've been through. -I just met such a nice young man. -How many pupils has Mr. Grimes got, Alec? -Oh, just the two of you, sir. Are you actually sure? Certainly, sir. Mr. Grimes never takes more than two at a time. -Well, what about the, uh… -Hm? Oh, really? Thank you, Alec. Thank you very much. Thank you. Ah! -Ah, now I see. -What? It's a motor car. Oh, still being the court jester, eh? Must keep everybody smiling. Except your clients. -Hey! You eating soon? -Soon as Henry comes back. -[Charles] Right, see you over there. -Right-o. -Evening, Mrs. Bristow. -Evening, Mr. Thursby. -Another parcel. -Why? What's the trouble? -The stairs. Been up and down all day. -Let me take it for you. -Would you? -Of course. Who's it for? -Top flat. -Right. Thank you so much. That is kind. Very much. [blowing] [ringing bell] [door opening] Good Lord. Why, hello again. I'm… I'm so sorry. I've just brought the, um, that for Mr. Smith. There's no Mr. Smith, they're for me. No Mr. Smith? You mean that you… But this flat… He never told me that. He never told me either. Look, let me carry this in for you, shall I? Thank you very much. Of course I knew when I got a terrific backlash in a prop shaft. I sought through eight quarter-inch bolts to get the lot casing down, opened the half shaft and what do you think I found? -Mice? -Oh, don't be an idiot, old man. The spines had gone. Smooth as a baby's whatnot. And I'd no hard extractor, so what did I do? Out with the whole differential and… You still with me? Unfortunately. -Well, if… -Look, I've had a heavy day. Don't you ever have a heavy day? Yes, of course we do. Then dry up. There's a good fellow. I wonder what's happened to Roger. He said he was going to wait for you. Funny. Wasn't there when I got back. Well, well, well. My learned friend. How did the case finish up? Did you get Mrs. Potter to reveal what did happen at Easter? -Or is that a leading question? -Ha, ha, ha. Where have you been? I am, I've decided, the studious type, Henry. -I have been studying. -What? Form, my dear fellow. Form. I say that's rather good, you know? [laughing] -Why don't you shut up and sit down? -A gracious invitation. But I shall not be dining with you, gentlemen, this evening. -I have an engagement. -Who with? -A client. -[Henry] Where? Here. Who is this client? Eh, oh, a dull character. Not your cup of tea at all. Might even be a waste of the evening. On the other hand, it, well, it might lead to something. Ah! Hello, Henry. Come on, Sally. I say, that's the top flat, isn't it? Pretty smooth ride. I like the body work too. Good Lord. Roger hasn't been slow getting away, has he? I say, do you usually take pepper in your coffee? A nice young man with Henry. Is he a barrister too? The spaghetti is very good. [bells chiming] Who can do it for us? -How about Mr. Thursby, sir? -Not yet, Alec. Not yet. He'll go on with more mistakes. Bad for him, bad for us. Here. [clearing his throat] Give him more of these to get on with. Let him watch and let him listen. We weren't soliciting, my dear fellow. We weren't even wearing our fur coat. We'd simply left our matches behind and we asked a man for light. Thank you. Mayonnaise? Thank you. If we'd only taken the shillings, we might have had a chance but we took the meter, my dear boy. We took the gas meter. [bells chiming] [sighing] [soft music playing] [chattering] [Roger] Down expensive. Goodness sakes! Stop worrying about the cost. It's money well spent. You'll probably find yourself playing with someone useful to you. All right. You realise I haven't touched a club for years. My dear fellow, golf's the last thing that matters. They see you, that you're around. It's a social occasion. Right, let's see what we've drawn in way of partners. Oh, Cleaver, chancery. Strewth! You got Ryman. Not the judge. There's only one Ryman. I believe he's quite a player. -I shan't hit a ball. -Then hit him for me. [man] Marshall. -I say, aren't you with judge Ryman? -Yes. He's waiting for you on the tee. -You want me to see what's happened? -Certainly not. I presume they can read. [judge] Here they come. Well, let's get on with it. [Henry] Hello, Cleaver. Sorry if we've kept you waiting. Uh, this is Thursby, judge. He's partnering you. [judge] So I believe. [Henry] I say, a beauty! -Do you mind, partner? -Sorry. [judge] You should be able to put us on the green from there. [Roger] Well, I hope so. [birds crying] [judge] It's here, you… In the rough. Oh, I'm so sorry. [judge] There's only one thing I can do here. Oh, good shot, sir. Very well done, indeed. I'm awfully sorry, sir. I say, do you think they're still with us? [Henry] Well, let's play on, shall we? They're here. I don't believe it. [Henry] It's over here, Judge! I say, I really am most frankly sorry, Judge. I… Oh, bad luck, sir. So the golf doesn't matter, eh? Just a social occasion. Only 17 more holes, old chap. I wonder, could you come and help us find the ball? Seems to be upset about something. It's somewhere around here, Judge. Don't think it came any further than this, Judge. All right, I've got it. Just a minute, you sure that's yours? There's another one here. And another here. Two, three, four! Oh! I say, I'm… I know, you're sorry. [honking] Ah! You made pretty good time. -I was just going to eat. -Oh, I'm just going upstairs for a wash. Oh, I'll hang on for you. Don't bother. There are one or two things I want to… Right, then. See you over there. Yes. Laundry tomorrow. -Don't forget to leave it out. -Shall be done. -Ciao. -Ciao, boy. -And Mr. Thursby. -Right. [Roger coughing] Look. Close the door! You'll get it all over the house. Crikey! What a stink! -What have you been doing? -Cooking. Cooking what? I'm sorry about this. It's that damn stove. It won't happen next time. You're going to do this every day? I'm fed up with the food around the corner, -and if you object to my cooking… -Take it easy, Roger. If you want to be a second Mrs. Biddle, go ahead. Don't worry me. Oh, Mrs. Bristow wants your dirty laundry. I haven't got any. -Eh? -I'm not sending any. They ruin your shirts and anyway, they're… Well, they're too darn expensive. I just assumed I'd do it myself. Oh. Oh, I see, yes. Good idea. [photographer] Now, then, young lady, let's see how this looks. Hm. Yes, there's room for improvement, I think. Left leg in just a little teeny weenie bit more. But don't show muscles. Yes, I think that's rather divine. Hold that. We'll take it. Give me those plates. Thank you very much. Oh! I spy strangers. Very well, then. Let's break for lunch. Lights, Cecil. Thank you. Henry, what are you doing here? I wondered if you might have lunch with me. But I only got half an hour. You should've warned me. -Your sandwiches, Miss. -Thank you. Look, in that case, I'll have lunch with you. Thank you very much. I want to talk to you. Look, it's about old Roger. We've got to do something. What's happened? I don't know yet, but something. He's really up against it. -In what way? -Broke. -Wired stiff. -Poor lamb. If he's got to sit as I do for over a year waiting for briefs, he won't stay the courts. That's a certainty. What can we do? Not we, you. Me? -You're an only daughter, aren't you? -Yes. -And the apple of the paternal eye. -It depends. Nonsense, I bet you can twist the old man round your little finger. -What's all this to do with Roger? -Simple. Barristers can't go tatting for business. It just isn't done. We can only get work through solicitors. Yes. Well, your father is a solicitor. In fact, the most influential member of Watson-Watson and Doncaster. I see. Watson-Watson and Doncaster? Mr. Cooper, please. Oh, is that you, George? Oh, it's Alec here. Look, you've sent us a brief marked up for Mr. Thursby. Yes, he can do it alright. It's the nephew, not the old man. He died 20 years ago. [laughing] Oh, well, you might not have heard. Right-o, George. Thanks very much. Ah. Here we are at last, sir. What we've all been waiting for. -Nice little one. Defend a divorce. -Thank you very much, Alec. -It has nothing to do with me, sir. -It came with your name on it. Really? -Who on earth? -Watson-Watson and Doncaster. They know the name Thursby, you see? They'll know it even better when you've done this. Well, as I said to him, I've had just about as much as I can stand. You know what I put up with. If he thinks he'll get away with that, he's made a big mistake. Not with me, he won't. This is Mr. Thursby, your counsellor. Oh! How do you do? You're very young, aren't you? -Come, sit down, Mrs. Newent. -Thank you. We're going to court very shortly and I want to ask you one or two questions about your discretion state. My what? Um, what you say here about your own… conduct. -Oh, Mr. Johnson knows that. -On your instructions, Mrs. Newent. I never gave any instructions. I mean I wrote what you told me. -But the statement is true? -True? Of course it is! There was just the once and you'd had a little too much to drink. That's right, dear. Gin and Frenches. I was on top of the world. Um… But you say here that you became faint and dizzy. That's quite right, dear. -And your husband suspected nothing. -Oh, nothing at all. We were discretion itself. If you'll pardon a little joke. [laughing] I see. -And that was the only time. -Certainly! What do you take me for? Just because I know what's nice doesn't mean I don't know what's wrong. And you can't be too careful running a boarding house when you know what people are. They will talk. - [Roger] I see. -Oh, Mr. Thursby, sir. Come along. It's time you were getting into court. Silence! Very well. [man] Newent and Newent. He's waiting for you. My Lord. [clearing his throat] In this case, I appear for the petitioner. He's quite brilliant, everyone says so. He won't have to be brilliant for this one. It's undefended. His uncle was Sir Reginald Barrington Thursby. I knew him well. Never liked him. Court Nine. Come along. [Roger] And now, Mrs. Newent, will you tell His Lordship exactly how your married life went? Well, it wasn't a life at all, really. Not what I call life. -Would you explain what you mean? -Well, he was always picking on me. Said I paid more attention to the boarders than I did to him. And did you, madam? [Mrs. Newent] Not more than necessary, My Lord. And what happened in the end? Oh, he left me. I see. -Were there any letters after that? -Not so much as a postcard. He's never offered to return or make a home for you? Home? He's never made a home for me in his life. It's always me who's had to make a home for him. Much obliged, My Lord. Discretion? So sorry, My Lord. Um… Mrs. Newent, if you look at your statement, please. Is what you say there true? And have you ever committed misconduct except as there stated? Well, yes, and no. I beg your pardon? Mr. Thursby, it's difficult to answer under those questions. -You say your statement's true? -Oh, yes, My Lord. You've never committed misconduct except on this one occasion? No, My Lord. Has he asked you to? Certainly not. Why not? Why not? Why not, My Lord? You've had one, so presumably you've no conscientious objection. You live in the same house and want to get married. I understand you refuse, but find it hard to believe he's never asked you. Oh, I see! -As a matter of fact, he did. -Oh. Uh, but of course, I refused. Yes, Mr. Thursby? On that… [clearing his throat] On that evidence, My Lord, I ask your logic to exercise at your discretion and grant a decree now as I was cast against the respondent. Mr. Thursby. Your client committed misconduct before her husband left her. Yes, My Lord. Surely that may be the reason why he left her. As a wife with misconduct the right to live with her husband provided she's a good enough liar. My Lord, but the husband deserted. How can you desert someone who hasn't the right to be lived with? Oh, My Lord. Harod and Harod… Harod and all the other cases say clearly that the petitioner has to prove the misconduct has not caused the desertion. But the evidence is that the husband didn't know of it, My Lord. The evidence of the petitioner. Not as sufficient, I think. Well, unless you have some further argument, Mr. Thursby. No, My Lord. Petitioner dismissed. What did he say? "Brilliant?" Dear, oh, dear. Mr. Smith was in court too. Who? -What brought him here today? -I don't know. Mr. Smith? Yes, the senior partner in Watson-Watson and Doncaster. [Mr. Smith] Yes, of course I'll give him another chance. In ten years' time. [Sally] Oh! But he can't wait that long. I've never known anything so disgraceful in all my life. It's a positive scandal. My friend got her divorce with no trouble at all. Why didn't you stand up to the old basket? Good morning, Mrs. Newent. This is what comes when employing kids. He's no right in the business. Still got the marks of the cradle on his back side. As for that judge, I'd like to have just five minutes alone with him. [ringing bell] Oh. Hello, Roger. Hello, Sally. You better come in. Thank you. I saw you in court this morning. Oh, yes. I just happened to be near there. Daddy took me. Yes, it was very silly of me. I haven't realised your father was Watson-Watson and Doncaster. Oh, yes. He's always in and out of the court. He loves it. Well, he must have absolutely adored it this morning. He was very impressed, I think. He's going to give you another chance. He told me. Ah, then I was right. It was you that sent me the brief. No. -Sally. -Well… Ah, ah. I may have just mentioned your name. And he was looking for someone not too expensive. Yes, someone who had his wits about and… Don't be silly. It was Daddy's fault landing you with that awful woman. [Roger laughing] Oh, Sally, you're wonderful. I only wish I hadn't let you down so badly. You can't win all your cases. Can't even win one. [hiccup] Don't be morbid. You will. You really think so? Of course I do. Cross my heart. Thanks. You know? Um, wish there was something I could do for you. Well… There's a lamp here that doesn't work properly. Aha! Lamp. I'm rather good at the little electrical things. [humming] Oh, hell. Confound it. -[objects clanking] -[Roger laughing] Slow? Well, of course it's slow. And it always is at the beginning, my dear fellow. And we take a few knocks as well. Hard knocks. But it's worth it in the end. Oh, yes. It's worth it. You know? When I recall some of the men I've seen crossing this court out here, some of the men I've known. Ah, great men. You know, your uncle was one of them. I feel very proud to belong and so will you, my dear fellow. Mind you, I'm not saying we all become Lord Chancellors as we can't all be brilliant. But whether we make thousands a year or merely a few hundred, we all have our part to play. And an honourable part. I don't doubt that. But, well, to put it bluntly, my trouble is that when the little money I have is gone I shan't have anything. I was wondering if I'd get on any quicker in Criminal Law. Give it a try, my dear fellow. Go down to the Old Bailey, see how you like it. Why not? Make a change of grinding out opinions for me all day. I never read them. You might pick up a dark brief. Yeah. Go and sit it out at the Old Bailey. Go and sit it out. [Forbes] My Lord… These two crimes were committed in one night. Doomed. They came to light in a curious way. It appears that the prisoner's wife did not know for what purpose he had gotten out that night. When he returned, she'd presumed he'd been drinking and refused to let him in. The noise of what followed were the wife giving him a piece of her mind and he attempting to quieten her attracted the attention of police constable Waters. Would you pause for a moment? There's a prisoner who wishes to make an application for a dark brief. As Your Lordship pleases. Put up Alfred Green. [man] Green. All right, Green, you may choose any one of these learned gentlemen. Mighty, eh? Well, him, Mr. Forbes. How are you, governor? [judge] You can't have him. He's engaged on the present case. Well, you did say anyone, My Lord. -Anyone but Mr. Forbes. -Oh, he's the one I want. I dare say he can't be in two cases at once. I don't want him in two cases, My Lord, I just want him in mine! [judge] Don't waste the time of the court. -[Green] Then him creeping up the aisle. -[judge] I'm afraid he's also engaged. In that case, may I suggest that the gentleman that were not for hire cover up their flags? It won't help to be impertinent. Perhaps those members at the bar who were not engaged be good enough to stand. Is this the best you can do? [judge] It's all we have in stock. Be quick. Ah, that's a nice white wig. I'll have that one. Mister, would you be good enough to undertake this defence? -If Your Lordship pleases. -[judge] Thank you. What do I do? Go see him now through the dock down at the cells. Quick, the old boy's waiting for you. Bow! Bow! [judge] Very well, Mr. Forbes. [Forbes] My Lord. To continue. There you are, sir. [door closing] Good morning. Oh, don't look so worried. Have a seat. Sit down. Make yourself at home. That was a line-up that stood up for you this morning. Get one of those old cloners and you might just chuck your cards in and plead guilty. Is this your first case? Well, I haven't had much criminal experience. Well, don't worry. I have. You may be a famous barrister who owes his start in life to Alfred Green. I'll get you through. It's a piece of cake. Could have done it myself. Got a sore throat. Well, my services such as they are at your disposal. That's a very pretty little speech. You all right? -Look, Mr. Green. -Have you got a fag? -No, I haven't. -Have one of mine. Soothes the nerves. -No, thank you. -I know exactly how you feel. I shook like a jelly in my first case. You'll not see me shake now. Seventeen times I've been up. Look, Mr. Green, unless you come to the point… That's the idea. Get tough. You've got to get tough. Shout down the other side, the judge if necessary. That's lesson number one. Now, lesson number two. What am I charged with? I have been trying… -You want to see the indictment? -Of course. Here we are. Exhibit A. "Charged with obtaining five pounds, fifteen shillings from Percy Halliwell by falsely pretending that the letter signed G. Sinclair -was a genuine reference." -Lovely, isn't it? -It certainly won't be unless you prove… -Ah, but I can. The other side can always make a mistake. Lesson number two. Now listen. I ran a mail order business. Cash with order. -People writing for the stuff… -Stuff? What sort of stuff? Oh, various lines. Rubber dogs this week. Army surplus the next. Depends what comes our way. They send the cash, they get the goods. Nothing wrong with that. -As long as the goods are as advertised. -What do you take me for? A crook? I can't deal with it if things perish in the post, can I? Tell me about this reference. Ah, that's a very good point. Now you see, my first letter I always offer a reference. What's more, I send them one whether they want it or not. Who wrote it? Who do you think? Frankly, I think you probably did. Don't look so bashful about it. Of course I did! I haven't a leg to stand on. The prosecution will prove this man parted with his money. -He believed the reference was genuine. -Ah, but he didn't. How do you mean he didn't? Well, I didn't post the reference until after I got the cash. -Well, how can you prove it? -Exhibit B, one certificate of posting. They've messed it up. They haven't filed the right indictment. -You're on the wrong charge. -Clever boy. You see, the thing that fools them is this. Although I send the reference after I get the cash, I date it back a week. -Why? -Don't be silly. Any grumble about the goods and what do they do? Try to nail me. They show the police the reference. It looks phony. It is phony. But they never got it till after they sent the money. So what happens? They frame up a charge which isn't worth the paper it's printed on. Right? With every respect I would say you are utterly and deplorably wrong. -Eh? -But on this single point of law, I'm reluctantly obliged to agree that you're right. On a technicality they must discharged you. Well, of course they must. I give you the ammunition. You just fire the gun and you'll come out as another satisfied client of Alfie Green. So do me a favour. Will you go and do it? [judge] Alfred Green, you have been found not guilty. You may stand down. Hey! Wait a minute. We're going to celebrate! -My dear fellow. You'll have the usual? -No, this is on me. I have just made the sum of two pounds, four… Two. So you got your dark brief. Well done. It wasn't well done. -Oh, sorry. You went down? -No, we won. You won? Nothing gloomy about that. Isn't it? -Cheers. -Cheers. I have been trying for months to win something. All over London I've been making an arse of myself letting down clients right, left and centre. And now, when at last I do win a case, what happens? My client not only turns out to be the biggest rogue but actually shows me how to win. Ah! There you are! What's that? Would be champagne. -Got any champagne, Miss? -Champagne? I'll have a beer then. This your pal? Green. How do you do? -My client. -How do you do? -You in this game? -We're in chambers together. All right. Have to look out for you next time. -Will you excuse us? -Did you see the judge's face? Oh, what a treat. He knew we got 'em beat. Mark you, they asked for it. Only charged me on one count. One count, me. Blooming insult. I've never had less than 12. But seriously, I'm happy to meet you two boys. Really. -Good. We have to be moving. -Just a minute. I can do you a bit of good. Listen. I know when I can lay my hands on a truck load of cutlery lost on the railway. Just put five pounds, I'll put five pounds and you can put five pounds and we'll split. Goodbye, Mr. Green. Come on, Henry. Bad luck, old man. Oh, might be too bad. Well, you can't give it away, can you? Ah. The easygoing bit, aren't they? Governor out back? Well, it's busy now. You might be interested in buying knives and forks for the house. Very cheap. Ooh. I don't know. I have a very good reference if he wants one. You could ask him. Oh, don't worry. Maybe I'll catch him another time. Mr. Marshall, I've got some news for you, sir. -A slander action. -That's the stuff. What's on the brief? Nothing much for the fee. -Where is it? The other had produced? -Wayford assize. Wayford? He's the local lad. Could you give Mr. Thursby a noting? If you wouldn't mind taking it. -I'd love to. -He could take a note for you, but I don't think the brief will go to two fees. -I'll let you know the times and trains. -All right, Alec. See what you can do. -We can spend the night with your family. -What? Make the whole thing worthwhile. No hotel bill. -I don't know about that. -Why not? You know parents. They'll have the whole parish turn up. [laughing] All right. We'll catch an early train in the morning. Stay the night when it's all over. Everybody's gone. Why won't we get to court? No. There's loads of time. Is the old boy inside yet? [Roger] Ah, here they come. Right. I say, shut the door. [door closing] My wig. -My wig! Where is it? -What? [Henry] Oh, my! They won't let me into court without it! I'm sorry, I do beg your pardon. Taxi! Follow that funeral! -Eh? -Quick! Follow that funeral! Know ye that we have assigned you to inquire more fully the truth of all offences and injuries whatsoever within our county of Wayford. Could you please stop a moment? Wind down your window? Just one moment? I most rightfully mind to bother you, but are you going much further? Uh, look, stop! You've got my wig in your top! My wig! Box alright at the back, Ernie? Yes. -What's he carrying on for then? -Ah. No respect. You're dead right, Ernie. [man] Let the jury be sworn. -Where on earth has he got to? -I don't know. He lost his wig. Lost his wig? You'll have to hold for him. All stand, please. -Have you read the brief? -Yes. We just want to put up a show. It's a loser anyway. We wouldn't have given it to Marshall if it hadn't any chance of winning. Give your name to the associate. I swear by Almighty God that I will well and truly… …and a true verdict given according to the evidence. Oh, dear. What? What's the matter? My mother, she's on the jury. …according to the evidence. Well, that's all right. -Object to her. -What? -When? -Now. Right before she's sworn. Go on, object! -He waved me down. -Then get up again. [judge] I told you to wait. If you don't know the rules ask someone who does. Tell him. [judge] Will you please sit down? Lord, I want… Never before in all my experience have I known a counsellor to behave in such a shocking manner. Thank you very much. Perhaps we can proceed with the swearing of the jury. You'll have to stop it. You heard what he said. It can't be helped. It's got to be done. Go on, tell him! I don't know your name, but your conduct is outrageous. I will now ask you for the last time to do me the personal favour of resuming your seat. -Lord, I… -I order you to sit down! I object to the next juror! She's my mother. [tapping] -What is his name? -Mr. Thursby. [judge] Mr. Thursby. Get up. Mr. Thursby, I owe you an apology. I hope you will see fit to accept it. Thank you, My Lord. I've placed you in a very embarrassing position. And you've dealt with it with the courage and patience I shall long remember. Thank you, Lord. You better leave the jury box, Madam. And I say that you have every reason to be proud of your son. Oh, I am, My Lord. -So is his father. -Hm. I'll see she gets a good seat. Thanks. Look, tell her she mustn't applaud. Mrs. Thursby. Your son asked me to find you a good seat, Mrs. Thursby. Oh, how kind of you. But I must telephone his father first. You see, we had no idea. I say, Bittle, what do you think? -He's here! The boy's here. -Who, Roger? Yes, at the Assize. He's doing a case now. -Rosalie! -Yes? Here, quick, tell your mother. Get some clothes. I say, anybody interested? Roger! He's in the Assize. [chattering] [woman] Well, who's coming? Members of the jury, it is claimed against my client that he uttered a slander. That by a defamatory statement he brought the plaintiff into disrepute. Our case was that the statement was privileged and that the words complained of were the expression of an honest opinion. Members of the jury, it is for the other side to prove that the words actuated were by malice. I'm not suggesting that the plaintiff did pull the horse in this race, but it was my client's honest opinion that he did. And if one journalist can't express an honest opinion to another then free speech is at an end. Now I don't wish to waste your time so I'm going to put my client into the box straight away. Mr. Frost, please. [Frost] I swear by Almighty God that the evidence I shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. [judge] Silence! Your Honour, Frost Andrew lives at the Pines Northern Lane in Henston. I am and I do. -You're a racing journalist, Mr. Frost? -I am. Better known to your readers as The Cun. Correct. Now, Mr. Frost, it's claimed against you that you were heard to say to the members in closure at Wayford race course, "That fellow ought to be hauled before the stewards for pulling his horse like that." -Did you say it? -I certainly did. -Why? -Because I believe it to be true. What was your object in making a remark of this kind? It is the responsibility of a racing journalist to uphold the high standards of the British turf. -And you had no other reason whatever. -No. To whom did you address these words? To a colleague, another racing journalist. Was it in fact a Mr. Fred Pulfrey? Better known to his readers as Sir Percival? Correct. [Tatlock] But you felt entitled to regard the occasion as privileged. [Frost] Definitely. You're putting words into your witness's mouth, Mr. Tatlock. Point understood, My Lord. Thank you, Mr. Frost. No, don't go. I expect my learned friend will put you at a fence or two. I think I should know the ones to refuse. Behave yourself. And take your hands out of your pockets. Yes, Mr. Thursby? Mr. Frost. You have been a racing journalist for several years. I have. In fact, many people in racing consider… Never mind, Mr. Frost. But I do mind. I think I can say that my reputation is second to none. -You have a very high opinion of yourself. -Well, why not? Quite. Now, do you in the course of your race go and back any horses yourself? Of course I do. You remember the horses you backed in the afternoon in question? Not off-hand I don't. In the second race, my client was riding a horse called Slippery Sam. The one that you honestly thought he pulled had finished fourth. Did you have a bet on that particular race? -Uh, no. -You do remember that. Would it make a considerable difference to your case -if you had backed Slippery Sam? -Isn't that a matter of the jury? If it'll help my learned friend, I quite agree that had my client had used the words because he'd lost money, it would make all the difference in the world. But such is not the case. He had no personal interest in the result of the race at all. I'm much obliged, my learned friend. Now tell me, Mr. Frost. In the second race, what was the name of the horse that you didn't back? -I didn't back? -That's right. I didn't back all the horses. -And which did you back? -I didn't say I backed any of them. Never mind what you didn't say. Which did you back? But I don't remember. -Are you sure? -Quite. -[Roger] Quite sure you don't remember? -[Frost] Definitely. Then how do you know that you didn't back Slippery Sam? -Ah! -Silence! I repeat, Mr. Frost. How do you know that you didn't back Slippery Sam? -Because I didn't. -But you don't remember what you backed. I do remember that I didn't back that one. Why? -Because I do. -You mean to tell the jury that the only thing you do remember is that you did not back Slippery Sam? -What am I to answer to that? -The truth. My learned friend has no business to bully the witness. He's doing nothing of the kind. It's a model of what a cross-examination should be. I respectfully disagree, My Lord. You can respectfully sit down, Mr. Tatlock. [applauding] [judge] Silence! Silence! I've never heard a demonstration such as this in all my experience. I'm sorry for the interruption, Mr. Thursby. Please continue. Um… [clearing his throat] So you did back Slappery Slim. Um… Slippery Sam. Didn't you? And for more than you could afford. How do you know what I can afford? Well, you could afford Mr. Tatlock, certainly. My learned friend is being extremely offensive. I intend it as a compliment, My Lord. That's exactly how I took it, Mr. Thursby. Please continue. Now tell me, Mr. Frost. When you attend a meeting, don't you usually have a bet on every race? No. I don't want to lose all my money. And how much did you lose on this occasion? You mean on that race? Yes. How much did you lose on that race? I didn't say I lost. How much did you lose, sir? I don't remember. But you didn't win. I didn't say I didn't. Don't prevaricate, sir. You lost, didn't you? -Well, I may have. -And it was on Slippery Sam, wasn't it? I… I don't remember. If you don't remember, you can't swear that you didn't back Slippery Sam. I… I suppose not. But you have sworn it, Mr. Frost. You have sworn it. You told us just now on oath that you did not back Slippery Sam. Yes, Mr. Frost? I'm sure the jury will draw their own conclusions from your silence. I don't feel very well. Indeed. In that case I will adjourn for luncheon. Mr. Tatlock, I would recommend that you take advantage of the adjournment to reconsider your position. [chatter] Look, old man. Come, let's have lunch and perhaps we can fix a sum in what you're prepared to settle for. It mustn't be too hard on this one. Sir, I'm so sorry. What happened? We won, Mr. Marshall. Very well done, sir. Thank you very much. Congratulations! -I say, isn't that marvellous? -I agree with you, sir. Well done, Roger! [chattering] [both whistling] You know, one of these days this thing's going to go. Ha, ha. Well, how does it feel? -It feels fine, Henry. -Good. Bags of briefs. Cheers. [car starting] Ha! Hurray! -What did I tell you, eh? -Where are you going with that? Oh! Sally! See you boys when we get back! [explosion] Subtitle translation by: Guillermina Usunoff
