Let's call the police. No way! No cops here! I'm concierge! - So what? - "So what?"! Here, I'm only second to God! You'd do better to stop your kids spitting on people. So, is it opening? Calm down, there's no fire. What's going on here? The young lady doesn't answer. That's why I was knocking on the door. When I saw that water there, I said to myself... "Here's another hassle!" Oh no! No one's coming in! It's not a circus! - Sir only. - And me? I pay my taxes! I'm family. I have the right to know. Buy the evening papers. Is she dead? Possibly, but not here, in any case. I'm having palpitations. If I pass out, will you carry me down to my lodge? I'll try. Poisoning yourself doesn't require overflowing the bathtub. Should we go get the doctor? Doctor, police or hairdresser... makes no difference And my flooded staircase? Gives you the chance to wash it. Hairdresser. Hello? Hello? What is it? I can't hear anything. Hello, it's Maxime. Good morning, Miss Darling. Oh, dear Count! What a joy to hear you on the phone! Funny idea to call me at dawn. It's a quarter past twelve. Already? Oh. It's crazy how the days are shrinking! Did I wake you up? Oh no. No, not really. It's just that I'm working, dear Count. Do you swear that's true? Of course I swear, Count. How jolly! Be aware that you'll be going out tonight. Are you listening to me? I'm listening to you, my dear Count... ...and I say "get fucked". Really? Well, me too. You?! Oh. We were cut off. You were saying? I didn't mean a word of it. Especially THAT word. I'm in a bad mood. Came home late? At dawn. The Irishman went wild. We did 43 nightclubs. 43, his wife's age. It was his birthday. It could have been his mother's. Did he behave? Too well. If he'd been worse, I could've dropped him. So am I doing it again tonight? Yes, but not with the same one. This time it's an Argentinian. Ricardo Cordillas, a gentleman. A 7am job. Meet him tonight at 6.30 at the Lutetia. The black velvet evening dress. Sign of recognition... orchid over your heart. Appearance, Literature and Sentiment. - You know what I mean. - As clearly as I see you. You are a girl of the world who has had misfortunes... and who guides rich foreigners around Gay Paree... ...while continuing to keep her dignity... ...and drink champagne. For this evening, you'll take a look at this book... ...on the contemporary literature of Argentina. And my percentage? Can we also take a look at that. 25 per cent as usual. Plus 10 per cent for documentation. Reading exhausts me. 35 per cent to spend the night with a gentleman? I offer 27. 33. Gentlemen bore me. 29. He's witty. So I'll have to laugh. 30. You don't leave out anything. My bank manager forbids me. - Alright, 30. I'm counting on you. - I'll be perfect. Scram. I'll take my bath. Wait 5 minutes till I've cleared the building. We can drop the "vous". So... the famous Montmartre that you wanted so much to see. Delightful! It was just lovely. And that piano sound was soo enchanting. Yes, "soo" enchanting! - Shall we take something here? - Later. The view from Sacre Coeur is beautiful and unforgettable. Like all the great things in Paris. But I want to see the little things. - The little things? - The fun little things... - The "noche" clubs. - Nightclubs? Good idea. Alright. And are these places… how do you say...? - Rare? No, no... what I mean is... Mr Cordillas, if I understand you right... ...there are special guides to go to that type of place. But I didn't mean anything like that. I meant those little places that are very... - Picturesque? - Closer... But still… - Strange? - No. Ah! Clandestine. Bravo! Well done, well done! That's exactly it. No need to break the piano, it's off-key. - Excuse me, I'll be back in a minute. - Alright. - Hello dear. - Good evening, Mrs Agnes. - What are you bringing us? - "Hello" would be nice. - We're used to each other. - That's no excuse. He's Argentinian. Argentinians are rich. - Push the champagne. - No need to push it. - Order the Imperial. - Undrinkable! - We have to sell it. - Oh, thanks! It'll be 15 percent In honour of what? My indigestion tablets. - No way! - Then my way is to the club next door. Okay, okay! You'll get your 15 per cent. Remember, the main thing... It's not the amount of the bill that interests me. Don't worry, me neither. Oh, doll! There are articulated dolls. So long away from you, I was getting bored. - What can I call you? - Darling. For me alone? No... It's Darling with a capital D. I understand. French is full of "nouances". "Darling"... It's all sweetness, all warmth. Like your little cakes... like your Metro entrances. - Thanks. - How about champagne? Sure. Pardon... thank you. Waiter! Monopol Brut 27. Oh no. Do you have any Black Label? We do. - Que esta? - My favourite. - Imperial Black Label. - Very well Madame. - Nice, this nightclub. - Awfully nice. At home, in Santa Fe, I have the same right across from my apartment. It was not necessary that I do 12,000 kilometres... ...to cross the road. Do you know what you want? No, yo no se. But I would like something else... Something more... More exciting! More secret? - Yes, yes, yes. - I'll do my best. A sucker. So here you go! You're happy? It's an underground gambling den. - Are you a gambler? - Me? By God...! I could gamble my father's head ...against a box of matches. My fingers itch! There's a banco of 11,000 F. - We'll give you a seat. - I should hope so. The banco is done. Card, please. You lost, Madame. Call my secretary. Have him bring me my chequebook. There's a banco of 22,000 F. Who does the banco? - What number? - Kleber 18-0. Ask for Senor Alvarez and tell him to hurry. The banco is not done. Call banco. - Banco! I say banco! - The banco is done. Card. - Darling! - Hey, so you're here. What are you doing in this dive? Museums are closed at night. It's unreasonable. Cordillas will give me 20 percent of his winnings. And if he loses? Armand will give me 15 per cent I'm covered... - Covered with shame. - How poetic! 8! 9. 9 to banco. - The 8 won. - The hand passes. The 2 and the 4. THANKS. - Games are made. The 13th, Mr. de Brasset, as per usual? Uh… - Not this time. - Nothing no longer go. 1 3, black, odd, lacking. 20,000. Who says banco? Banco! He only knows that word. It's the one I prefer to hear. And a special Manhattan for Miss Darling. Hey, buster... that wasn't for you. Hey... twin sisters! I'm very sorry... Let me get you another one. 2 more of the same. Goodness… What happened to your sister? You strike me as being a man who's had quite enough to drink. I'm not tipsy. I'm just... I'm just furious. Ah! Roulette... Your winning system didn't work? No system... Rudolf. Rudolf? Yes. My mascot. Did it work for you? I always win. It's no longer amusing. I have a surefire way. -Which means? I need a tip badly. It's very simple. You do like me... and you say... "Nothing is impossible when we want it." And? The miracle happens. You can always try it. Nothing is impossible when we want it. Attention! No gambling here! Harmless pleasures. Music and dancing. Do it! The miracle! It was me who did this? Imbecile! It's the police! "Mucho" picturesque! That's for sure! Drinks for everyone. It's my round! I wanted to see the attractions. It's the police! Exactly! All part of the fun! Don't leave me! Take me. I want to go home. "Nothing is impossible when you want it." Come on! What's this? Nobody move! What do the police want? I protest! Everyone on the bus! - Grab me that one! - He calls me "that". Since when is it forbidden to make music?! I'll make a complaint to the minister! We don't have a ministry of gambling. Well, that of Education?! Oh what a beautiful life! E. Delore, called "Darling". - Yes? - Your turn. No kidding... I'm counting on you. Who do you take me for? You're Miss Delore, known as "Darling"? Elisabeth Delore, known as "Darling". Alright. You know him? - No. - We picked you up together. So what? - Do you often play there? - Play? Play, yes. No, he's not a musician. Joking doesn't suit you. What'll we do with this one, Boss? It's okay this time. I can leave? Not so fast. You can sit down. For you, it won't be the same. I haven't done anything wrong. Oh really? Taking foreigners to gambling dens, where they're fleeced? I've never hustled anyone. I swear. "Cross my heart and hope to die." Oh, damn! Inspector Dubois, of the Gaming Squad. A cop! A Chief Inspector. -Elisabeth Delore, known as "Darling". Nice nom de guerre. Glad you like it. Why am I here? To recall your victims. Who are doing well. You've done a lot to help them. It's nothing... a phone call., E. Delore, born June 23, 1923 in Paris. Alternately saleswoman, model. Honourable professions. Hardly honoured. Less honourable professions... Hostess at 'Le Triolet' and 'Souris Blanche'... Then lately a hustler for Villette Armand at 5 per cent. 15 percent for you. You were an exceptional customer. Thanks. Will you sign? - No. - We don't agree? It was Mr Cordillas who asked for a place… How to say... Exactly. I wanted to see Armand and his duettists at work. Please sign. Earlier, an Argentinian told me... speaking of my name... "Darling, it's all sweetness, all warmth." An Argentinian on a roll is creative. I'm sorry, but someone said that phrase before you. My mother. Just dropped by the mother! Not any mother... By my mother! I'm not asking you to believe me but don't laugh about it. Nevertheless, the profession you chose would hardly gratify her. I don't bring honour on her, but I support her, and it's not easy. And it's expensive, the bakers, doctors, landlords. Only prison is free. She approves of this life? I've told her that I was in theatre. If she knew, she'd die. Please don't give my name to the newspapers. Truly. Where does she live? In Montlucon. Lying is easy. I've no reason to be conciliatory. Yes, I'm nothing to you. With girls like me it doesn't matter if we live or die. Don't you think I could have turned out like your kids if I'd had their chance? Forgive me. It's been so long since I wanted to cry. Poor kid! We didn't call you! Sit down! But… Enough! Your mother lives in Montlucon? No? So shut up! Sorry, I'm being ridiculous. You can put me in jail. At least I won't see anyone. - Go on, get out! - How?! However you want! But quickly! You mean that... I'm free? Get out! Is that clear? We've had enough of you! - Bravo! - You too! Thank you, Inspector. Give your thanks to that idiot Argentinian. And take his last piece of advice... Change your occupation. Get that Armand in here. He'll pay for the others. Hey… - Can I drop you somewhere? - If you want. Glad to see you're free. I can't get over it. I'm still upset, thinking of you, your mother... your family. Young man, forgive the tears that I made you suffer. Why? Did you fall for my poor mother at Montlucon, too? Fall? You could be a police inspector. So it was play-acting? A bit melodramatic. - You liked it? - I'm blown away! Taxi! To Montmartre. Those idiots didn't see anything. Unlike you? I admit you really had me too. It's true that life hasn't always been kind to me. But if there's one thing I've learned... ...it's how to defend myself. Let's drink to that. You tired? Never in bed before 4am. - Where shall we go? - Let yourself be led. Others have married before you. They got to choose their wife. I'm being told who to marry. But that's from the Middle Ages! Exactly. A castle, a dragon and a prince. The dragon wants to marry-off the prince to the one he doesn't love. I've already refused 6 times. - The same one? - 6 different brides. My Aunt Constance can't be resisted much longer. In my world, everything is done according to tradition. And you won't get any money until you're married? Correct. Working for money is out of the question... ...and courage not obligatory, as you prefer. I defend myself as best I can, but I feel that I'll be worn out. Even Rudolf abandon me. Hello, Darling! Do you know this tune? It's kind of my departure song. It all flies away on the wings of the wind. Everything flies away, like a promise you make while dreaming. And the comedy is over. Let's part without harsh words. Farewell, Darling... Everything fades like the colours of last spring in space of time. It's the law of love, and it says the frivolous hours fly away carrying happiness. Farewell, Darling. Is there anything that you don't know how to do on your own? Alone? To take seriously the nonsense boys tell the girls hugging them too close. Sorry I believe you're called Darling. Because everyone adores you? Because nobody likes me. It's the same thing. "Goodbye Darling" is dedicated to you? No... You don't say goodbye to me like that. Are you feeling sad? Were those tears at the police station... I was acting. You put the police in your pocket and me with them. What's got into you? I have an idea. You don't seem used to it... you've gone quite pale. It's nothing. I have an idea for a counter-offensive. You can save me. Look. A kind soul sent me this photo, secretly. What is it? A photo of the disaster. My 7th fiancee. It may be a bad photograph. Please, no exaggerated optimism! I can't marry that! Thank God I met a good fairy who can pull off a miracle. What kind of miracle? She must appear in the Bretillac sanctuary. Oh, I forgot. Bruno Bretillac. Darling, miracle specialist. Delighted to meet you. Charm. So the fairy appears in the tribe. First objective... Seduce all the Bretillacs... especially Constance. For that, the fairy would need the right sort of family. A nobility-sounding name would do it? Yes, it is much appreciated. I arrive 3 or 4 weeks later. I am introduced. - Bride No. 8. - I please you. - We get married. - You get the money. - We divorce. - Incompatibility - And that's it. It is not so simple. Don't say no. Listen to your good heart. - I'm listening to it. - What's it saying? It's saying... - 300,000 francs. - 300,000 francs for that? Half at the marriage... Half at the divorce. Girls are expensive. Perhaps Rodolphe will make you a better offer? 300,000 francs. Well worth it. You'd hope that... Nothing is impossible when we want it. - You're still making fun of me. - Just give me the details. Is it still far to the castle? No, we could almost touch it. He said the same thing half an hour ago. - Your plan is in place? - Don't worry. Can I give you some advice? You can leave me alone. I have to get acquainted with the Bretillacs. Nothing fancy. Why are you smiling? I doubt that the arrival of your person... ...is enough to seduce the dragon announced outside. The famous Aunt Constance. I'm sure I've met worse. There you are! That's not a castle. My dear girl, between Orange and Marseilles... ...any house that has more than 3 front steps is a castle. Oh? Good luck with your offensive. Are we waiting for the lady? Won't be long... relax. Lift! Excuse me… What do you want? To see Mrs Constance Bretillac. - What about? - It's personal. I imagine. I'm Mrs Constance Bretillac. I'm sorry, I didn't expect... Everyone works here. You wanted...? I'm traveling in Provence. In Aix, I was advised to come visit your olive oil mill. Gladly. But you you're not properly dressed. I'll be careful. - You'll need to. - No problem, Madame. I'd be grateful if you'd come with me. Impossible for me to do. My head steward will take you. Brichet! That's it. Madame? Would you show this young lady the mill and how it works. Excuse me. If you would like to follow me, Miss. This way, the arrival of the olives, hand picked. Beating them down with a pole, bruises them. And a bruised olive gives a bad taste to the oil. A large family, the Bretillacs, with 10,000 feet of olive trees. And then it's processed, in there. You're not thirsty? No thanks. You needn't worry, it's clean. So there are a lot of Bretillacs? 2 brothers and the sister-in-law... Edouard, Etienne, and Constance. Edouard is the funny one of the family, a true southerner. A poet in the local language, he has a son who is having a wedding in Paris. - And the other? - Etienne manages the export. And Constance? She's the whole family in one. She works like a dog. I know what I'm talking about. I've worked for her. I thought she'd work me to death. Is that the whole family? The important ones. There's also Etienne's son, cousin Therese... ...and the other brother, Frederic. Oh, that one! - What does he do? - Nothing. Just between us, he hunts tigers, with the savages in Africa. He left, just like that... abruptly, one fine morning, 10 years ago. Might one find a small cottage around here? Ask Mr Larieux, the grocer. He also handles rentals. Here's your young lady! That was remarkably quick. Well then...? So...! "So" what? You've finished your oil studies? They threw you out? Have my comfy seat. We going? - And the dragon? - A cow. Where are we going? Larieux. - What's that, turpentine? - This? Bretillac olive oil. Complimentary to any visitor. Oh Madame, sorry for the intrusion, but I'm in great pain. I was hit by a car. Could I stretch out for a moment? Thank you. No. No?! Why no? The Bretillacs aren't brutes. They'll offer me a seat and a pick-me-up. Exactly. They'll even call their doctor... ...who will see in 20 seconds that you've never been hit by a car. And you'll enjoy all the flavour of that old expression... ...to be emptied like a chamber-pot. Let's admit... My sister, two fried eggs on the plate… Dear lady! What a joy to meet you! E. Valon-Delore, President of the Union of Concerned Women... ...for Addressing Unhappy Childhood in the Upper Niger. Likewise. Oh no, I'm just passing through. So only 5 minutes. Thank you. I'm so busy. That's enough. Yes, just a drop. Too kind. I'll explain it to you. Delicious! From Ceylon, isn't it? The only tea in the world. Our research seeks regional CEOs in the province. Sensitive position. Also, we thought of you. No. You're becoming annoying with your "No", "No", "No"! No, that's not how you'll get the Bretillacs. So what will do it? Me. Oh, to hell with your mayonnaise! Better to succeed in small things than miss the big ones. Is that for me? Yes. Once you're out of ideas... you will call on mine. I do not need anyone. Be my 25 percent uncle, make your mayonnaise, and I will do the rest. One day, you'll beg me to help you. And do you know what I will do? What? I'll take 35 percent from you. Antoinette, send Gaston to me, as soon as he's back from the station. Don't bother... I'll serve. The train arrives at 4.35pm. Taking 30 minutes from the station... ...one would expect that Bruno had arrived. Trains are often late. Especially the one that brings your son from Paris. We've been waiting for him for 4 days. I'd told Bruno just what he should do. Has Bruno ever done anything that you suggested? Ah, my poor Edouard! What is it, my poor Etienne? Nothing! But remember that if Bruno was my son... mine.... I'd be his uncle. The important thing with Bruno, is that it happens. If he wasn't here to welcome Mrs Chomelette and her daughter... ...that would be embarrassing. When do they arrive? 15 minutes. Trains are late sometimes. Some. Not mine! You coming? Well, I'm ready. To what? I'm Abdelkader. Pou has been besieging me for 3 days. Dad, I'm General Bugeaud. - Have you found Mr Bruno? - No. No one got off the train. That's all. Hardly surprising. He could be coming by car. Mrs Chomelette will be here in 10 minutes. You believe in miracles, Therese. That's too hard! You'll get a slap! He's going to beat me! Bruno didn't know we'd be introducing him to the Chomelette girl. He may have had a feeling. Unless… In your last letter to Bruno, you didn't mention anything? - I don't know. - Well, I do. Pou, go to the garden. But I had Uncle Edouard circled. Will you just go out! We'll finish a bit later. Tell me the truth. I didn't do anything. I just sent the photo of the Chomelette girl... ...so he he'd know what to expect. So that's it! - You've no shame, Edouard? - No, I haven't! After all, Bruno's my son! I didn't want him to fall into this trap! Trap?! 7,000 feet of olive trees, 4 million dowry... a trap?! After all... 7,000 feet of olive trees are not going to make Bruno happy! Happiness is being wise! A biscuit. This marriage is wise, useful. We'd decided that. But I think that for a change... ...it wouldn't hurt if one of us got to marry the woman he loves. The woman we love is the one we marry. The family comes first. We owe it to those who survive us! Don't forget the sad example of Frederick... ...at which you are the first to blush. He married the woman he loved. A waitress. To save face, we invented this tiger-hunting in Africa story. Will I have to start over? Mrs Chomelette and her daughter. Show them in. It's up to you to explain to them. Hello dear friends, how are you? Passing along the road, it occurred to us to call in. No need, he's not here. You're right, he's not here. How come? A minor setback, I assure you. We received a telegram from Bruno, apologising. He'll certainly arrive very quickly. Tomorrow. Or the day after tomorrow. At the latest. Of course. Please take a seat. You too, my little Aimee, sit down. - Will you have a cup of tea? - Gladly. - Cream? - Gladly. When you have children in a family… My turn to laugh a little. My dear girl... At your age you deem it impossible that everything you do will not succeed. I bet you another 5 percent ...that you'll be drinking tea in less than 15 minutes. - Taken! - 15 minutes. Check your watch. - Must I wait? - Not for long, don't worry. When Bruno was 6 years old... ...he already had an amazing mind. How he used to make us laugh! - And still does. - Yes. He's a charming, hard-working, sober young man. And not at all boring. On the contrary, he is... He's full of the unexpected. "Unexpected" is not the right word. But that's charming...! Aimee loves the unexpected. - Don't you, dear? - Yes, Mum. Yes? Someone here to see Mr Edouard. Me? I'm coming. Please excuse me. I'll be back. I'll be back. Mr Edouard Bretillac? Yes sir. You wanted to see me? Count Maxime de Bresset. Nice to meet you, Sir. Sit down please. I don't have the pleasure of knowing you, Sir... ...but I do know your brother... ...who I recently met abroad. Ah! Stephen? - No, Frederic. - Oh no. - Etienne? - No, Frederic. Frederic Bretillac. - Frederic? YOU. Do you know Frederic? Yes. I shot a tiger or two in his company... ...in the wilds of Upper Katanga. We empathized right off. And as I was passing through this area... - Enough, Sir. - Pardon? As Frederic's brother, I am of course aware of... It comes down to… ...what you know. Ah… What I know. Yes. Thank you for your delicacy, but it was useless. Tigers are overseas. You certainly understand. Definitely. I'll go tell my sister-in-law, Constance. She is the head of the family. And seeing as you come from Frederic... ...it's best she hears it from you. I didn't hurt myself. Excuse me. You're right... time to scram. Mr de Bresset is it? - Constance Bretillac. - My respects, Madame. I was unsure about bothering you on such a small matte... I even hesitated. If it's about one of ours, the motive is important. So you're coming from Frederic? Yes. Yes I am. Yes. We can talk over here. So you know Frederic and the tiger hunt? Yes. Yes of course. The tiger hunt, overseas. Antoinette... bring cognac and lemon juice. You haven't changed your habits? Certainly not. What do you... Maxime, you really are acting badly. - I assure you… - It was useless. And I assure you, useless to use Frederic to get closer to me. I've not forgotten anything. I've so much time to remember. Helene! Helene, yes. But for you only. I had 2 first names, too. One you liked, Helene. ...and the other that looked like help for my future... Constance. I had to choose Constance. Helene… I finally find that little girl of yesteryear. - It snowed on that little girl. - No. It's as if I found a box of forgotten letters... ...and everything is suddenly reborn, your voice, your smile, your perfume. My heart is beating very fast. You thought you saw me. Me? Yes, Yes of course. But to see you there, beside me. Leave it there. Thank you. I'm Mrs Bretillac now, Maxime... Never forget it. Sorry. I'll make you your mixture. 2/3 cognac, 1/3 citron. Tell me about yourself. What have you done since then. - Since you and I? - Nothing. - I've lived. - Well? A long time. Happy? Like the drink... one third, two thirds. You take life as it comes. I never thought there could be so many things in such a small glass. You're travelling in the area? - With my niece - A niece? - Yes, she's charming. - Where is she? - Out the front. - You left her outside? You can't do that, Maxime. I'll have her brought in. Let me introduce you to my brothers-in-law. - Not a word about Frederic. - Very well, Helene. - Nor Helene! - Yes, Constance. Excuse me, Miss, Mrs Bretillac asks if you'd like to come inside. Really? You're sure? Yes, Miss. Very well. 14 minutes. Do I wait? This time I don’t know. At least three weeks. Thank you. Loneliness is only heavy in a big city… Cities are different... - Sugar? - 4. ...among the indifferent for whom we are nothing. Not just now, thanks. Elizabeth! Come in, dear, don't be nervous. Allow me to introduce you to my niece Elisabeth. - Mrs Constance Bretillac. - Delighted, Miss. Madamee. I believe we've met before. Indeed, my niece told me. She was delighted with the visit. She's thirsty for education. My cousin. Mrs and Miss Chomelette, friends. My brother-in-law Edouard and my other brother-in-law Etienne. Please sit down. A cup of tea? You're too kind, ma'am. You are very welcome here. 15 minutes on the dot just.) - It's hot. - Careful. THANKS. Sugar for you, my child. Therese! I forgot to send the invitations to the sub-prefect! Don't worry. It's done. But who sent them? Darling. Ah good. My mind was elsewhere. - So you were preparing your speech? - Why "my speech". You know very well that it's a poem. You've been working on it for a year. Everyone knows. I'd forgotten this! - What is it? - A telegram. You're impossible! - It came this morning. - It could be important. No. It's from Bruno. I read it already. Oh, I was just thinking... I'd like to know what he invented, so as not to come. He's coming. My pet, I bet you've had no lunch. Come along. - But I have. - Who took care of you? - It was Darling. - Of course it was Darling. Hello Max. This isn't a morning like any other. - A morning of glory. - Right. There should be flowers. - The Bretillacs are 100 years old. - 100 years of effort, work. 3 men dedicated their lives to achieve this result... - A family and a name. - You've done just as much. My husband took over from his father and grandfather. The way was paved... ...for the admirable Constance. That was the Christian-name he thought was needed. Let's go to the rose garden. "Today is the centenary of our dear home. "It's not an ordinary day "We're going to celebrate... let's dance." No. "Let's dance!" “All the Bretillacs are brave. "Their blood boils in their town... "Their blood boils in their town... "...made by strong arms in the shadows." Uh… "In the shade." "In the shade of our red tiles." Yes... "of our red tiles." It's you? How do you know my poem? I've been hearing you reciting it for a year. I remembered it. So you've been spying on me? You're so funny when you act the clown. Stay out of my way! This evening, ask me to be at the party. I can whisper the words to you. Obviously, that'd help me out a bit. I'll hide behind the piano. No, it would create complications with your father. I will do it by myself. Unless I ask Darling. Did you have the car sent to bring the musicians? That's not my concern... It's Darling's. Here I am calling her "Darling." You still have your youthful laugh. Maybe that's because I've had so little opportunity to use it. Have you ever thought what your life could have been like... ...if you'd chosen otherwise? I didn't. Others have chosen for me. Do you ever regret that? Never. Never, when I see how things have gone. But sometimes when I'm feeling all alone... ...there's a little girl in my dreams... ...who takes the hand... ...of a young man named Maxime. A little girl whose name is Helene. This is not a conversation suitable for the centenary... ...of the House of Bretillac. I have 1,000 things to do. Who'd do them for me? Darling. Good morning, Count. Good morning, Madame. Mum sent me to thank you for your invitation... ...and tell you that we accept. Delighted. And your nephew? He will surely be here tonight. I'll be so glad to meet him. Imagine! A Parisian! - Tell me… - Madame? - This hat. - Isn't it pretty? It was chosen by Darling. Ah… - Ah, Mr Bruno! - Hello Gaston. - I'll announce your arrival. - First I have to get dressed. - 800km non-stop! A record? - Not at all. - Really? - Yes. Edouard is well. Constance and Etienne too. No one would believe they were widowers. My suitcase is in the car. - Aren't you going down? - Shortly. They're waiting for you. I'll be there. Don't tell anyone. Very well, Sir. - Cigarette? - Pardon? Yes, thanks. - Lovely ball. - It is. - The Bretillacs are lovely people. - They certainly are. Pardon? Nothing. I was looking at that girl there. The one with the funny dress with the butterfly. Oh yes. It takes all types to make a ball. It's encouraging. It seems that her mother is that picturesque one at the buffet. She'll look like her mother one day. That'll complete the picture. - Ready? - If you like. - I'm not in a hurry. - It's the time for it. My dear friends, please come a little closer here. We could have found better. Than my ham of a brother? You said it. This won't take long. Edouard. Yes. I'd like... Listen, you don't have to force them. Too late, they're waiting... Try not to ridicule us. A speech. That takes the cake! I'll put it back in prose. It'll be better for some other time. For our 2nd centenary? That's it... My pleasure. - Aimee, do you sing well? - Yes Madame. Her teacher says she has a golden voice. - Doesn't he? - Yes Mum. Then you can sing us something. No, no, I don't want to. If your warbling matches your plumage...! How nice it will be. And some poor guy might get to marry her! Certainly. 7,000 feet of olive trees and a 4 million dowry... ...ever remained single. Oh yes. You'll see. Goodbye! - I don't want to! - Sweetheart! I don't want to! You stupid girl! She refuses! Excuse her. She's just a bit shy, no doubt. Here's someone who'll accept. Excuse me, I was back-up at the office. You are an angel. And if you want to be even nicer... - I'm ready for anything. - Aimee refuses to sing. Would you replace her? Aimee is taking lessons. But I... Don't worry, we won't be too critical. Oh, maybe I should have got started anyway. - Gaston, I'm leaving! - Are you kidding? I'm getting the hell out! And you've never seen me. Thanks Gaston. The night sky is starry, everything seems unreal. And in this strewn gold on the roads of heaven, we can read, they say, the future, the past. Me, I would like to know what's going to happen… pretty little star, before falling asleep, I'm waiting for you to reveal me my whole future. I loved with all my being. My happiness is gone. Never a letter and maybe everything is finished. Pretty little star, I hope for his return always, always. Little star so wan, why do you have to cherish those who do not love likewise and still suffer? In the big, cloudless sky, come quickly to my aid. Smile at me little star of love. Constance found you a stunt-double. I hadn't planned on singing. Thank you my dear. I will. Ah! There you are... Things are looking up. Hello Aunt Constance. Hello Dad. You finally managed to come. My work, my occupations. Oh no! Don't take me for a fool. Let's forget that. My nephew Bruno. Miss Elisabeth Delore. She's known as Darling. A pilgrimage from a long time ago. I think of the passing of our of our 20 years. If only we'd had those 20 years. How did you manage to get yourself such a niece? You like her? You'd think she was here on purpose. Nice couple, her and Bruno. Look at the expression on Mrs Chomelette, to realise it. Darling doesn't have money? She's pretty enough to pay for the luxury of being poor. Mrs Chomelette would give 4 million. As damages? I can't believe it. Here you are. - I'm your dance program. - Like the oil mill? - You are one. - I thought they were smarter. I've worked hard at it, you know. - It's been a quality job. - I'm sure. The hardest thing was to knock out the Chomelette girl... 7,000 feet of olive trees to uproot quietly! And the olive tree is firmly planted in the heart of the Bretillacs. You've no desire to flutter about the dance-floor? It's nice to watch young people dancing and flirting. Flirting? An international English word. Chinese to you. The Chomelette campaign has collapsed. We need to make our move. - Are you in such a hurry? - A little yes. Your plan? Still the same... you love me, you marry me, you pay me, you get divorced and that's it. To fall in love with you right away would not be credible. Thanks very much! So no love at first sight? Of course, that could be believable. Too kind! I'm kidding. How not to love you instantly? You're quite overwhelming. I'm not asking for that much. You have to dance with Bruno. Yes Mum. Should I ask him? No, you idiot! Chin up! - Smile. Be irresistible. - Yes, Mum. - Leave me. - Why? I'm from a good family, my dear. You're compromising me. Look. Hurry up, the Chomelettes are on the verge of passing out. There you are! I barely saw you just now. So how do you find our little Elizabeth? - Elizabeth? - Darling, if you prefer. Well, I find her... And you, how do you find her? I believe she has great qualities. Excuse me... Lot of work. - What does he mean? - Chinese for me too. An Armagnac. A cognac with a squeeze of lemon. - Have we met before? - In a way. - Count Maxim de Bresset. - Bruno Bretillac. Oh yes. Don't you think that the reputation of a young girl... ...is a fragile flower that the slightest breath can damage? Referring to...? It's obvious you were courting my niece. There's talk already. No? It's you, the noble-name phenomenon! Very successful! She could have done worse. And you too. But then, I really admire Darling. You are a joke. Too kind! Have another drink, old chap... Your nobility will soon evaporate. Enjoy it. You two know each other? Yes, I congratulated Mr de Bresset on having such a lovely niece. The uncle is no less so. I know this dear Count de Bresset well. Do you know this gentleman? For 35 years. And you Maxim... How do you find my nephew? Very nice. And gifted with amazing insight. - There he is now, all confused. - It's the charm of youth. Enjoy your youth, dear boy, it will soon evaporate... ...into smoke and dust. - He's nice, isn't he? - My uncle? No, my son, Bruno. Charming. He looks like you. I wish he didn't look too much like me. ...because all my life, I was only a man good will... ...and therefore without will. I've walked in the footsteps of others... I've obeyed. Do you regret it? My dear girl… ...there's always a little bitterness in not having made your own life. I don't exist... and never have existed. I am just a lump of Bretillac, a superfluous lump. Bruno will do better, I think. He seems to have ideas of his own. I had ideas too. They have worn away until they became the ideas of others. Other Bretillacs. Because I was alone do you understand, Darling? Alone in the midst of my brothers, alone with my wife. Always alone. I wouldn't like that Bruno was also alone. Do you mind if I steal her from you? Yes I do! You've already danced with Darling. Take care of others... Miss Chomelette, for example. - What on earth for? - Because she's your guest. You sound like Uncle Etienne. Sometimes all the Bretillacs need to agree. So go! Alright. This is only a postponement. You see? He obeys, too. Would you grant me this dance, Miss? - With pleasure sir. - She takes lessons. Her teacher says that music gives her wings. I've no doubt about it, Madame. - Music doesn't give me wings. - Oh, it does. No. Mum has no opinion of me and pays my teachers to get one. You seem very modest to me. It makes me forget about my dowry, which is rude. - You love Darling, don't you? - What? Until I came, I'd never seen her before. You'll have to wait a decent interval, but you'll love her. I saw it in your eyes just now. - I see many things, eh? - Without seeming to. Beware of young girls who always go with their eyes lowered. It's a bad sign. You're right, she's very pretty. Think so? Yes. And all the more gladly, since although Mum wants me to marry you, ...I don't like you. You don't guys that. I'm frank. Franker than you. And I guess you like someone else. A little. - Excuse me. - Why? I imagining what it would be like if I were to marry you. Thank you for this instructive evening. We'll never forget it. Shall we? Yes Mum. You're too kind. Not at all. Would you give our regards to your lovely nephew... ...and that delightful girl. I don't see them. Perhaps they're lying down? Darling will be sorry. I sent her to help Antoinette. Bruno is seeing the sub-prefect to his car. I trust you'll excuse them? That's quite alright. Good night, dear friends. - Good night. - What a cow! - She's upset. Good evening. Did you see, in front of that tree? They could have gone behind it. I believe we've been spotted. We're doing nothing wrong. All that matters is what seems to be happening. What do you think that is? That I'm courting you, for example. Let's not trust appearances... Come on... It's hidden her. No one can see us. What's going to happen? Well... Nothing. That's to say that… You aren't going to take advantage of the situation. Really, you intimidate me. You're so different from the Darling of Montmartre. Different? Really? You think so? It confused me. Did you think badly of her? You thought the Darling of Montmartre was no than a clockwork doll... ...incapable of real emotion? No, Bruno, I also know how to be soft. Darling… And when Cherie ceases to be a first name... ...to become a plea, like that... A plea nicely said... ...then… Darling. - That's it. - What? - That's enough, we've been seen. - They… So it was just for that?! Nothing else? You were frozen. I really had to help you. Here I am, officially compromised by the light of the moon. You're a gentleman... you know the rest. Let's just forget the gentleman! Easy now...! 4 Bretillacs and 10,000 olive trees are watching you. You're a... a... Tell me that tomorrow. The deeply upset girl must escape the arms of her beloved... ...and run away. Don't scowl, you look like you've had a tooth pulled. Darling... I'm... I'm very happy. - She's adorable! - I agree. The first Bretillac in love! Yes, we're becoming madly modern. You know she has no dowry. I could maybe give her one. We'll have kiss the Chomelette olive trees goodbye. 3, 6. This'll be the 1st first time a marriage wanted by us will not serve the family. There are other ways to serve a family. Yes, but that had to be said. Edouard, you were talking about a romantic novel. This novel will be published at our cost. Bravo! 59. Let's go to bed. We can't decide on anything, until Bruno's made up his mind. - All agreed? - Of course. What are we going to say to the Chomelettes? You're thinking of olive trees. You can't spend your time on sentiment and poems. Mrs Chomelette is charming... and a widow. You're a widower. - Don't wait! - Idiot! You’re not much fun either, but so what? You make black olives. Complete and lightning victory. Congratulations. Thanks. We're going to be rich. We should be delighted. I am. Discreetly. Very discreetly. If something's bugging you, don't be shy, tell me. It's nothing really. Just a bit sad. I tell myself that I'll have to leave all this... ...this house, these people. My niece disguise. Be careful, Darling... Bad actors are those who continue to play their role when it's over. I know. Give me another cigarette. I'm going. Thank you, Uncle. Good night. Who's there? It's me, Darling. Not in bed yet? I'd gone downstairs to smoke. And you? I had gone for a walk. Got a light? That frigging bird again! There are so many things going haywire... For 25 years this clock's been giving me nightmares! It doesn't have a pretty voice. You seem quite nervous. I was nervous, yes. During my walk, your image obsessed me. And now your presence soothes me. Figure that out! You just need to rest. Possibly. Whose fault is it? I'm leaving a nice Darling, without mystery... ...and I find a strange, unknown girl. That's all? Annoying, too. Especially annoying. Like a too-perfect mechanism... We want to know how it works. It does not work. No? How do you kiss... outside your working hours? Like this! What's going on?! It's me, ma'am. I was checking that the lights were off. Good. Thanks. I was surprised by a noise. Draught slammed the French window. Goodnight. Good night. Don't stay up too long. - The French window thanks you. - You're welcome. Go up quietly. Darling… I apologise. I wasn't thinking straight. Now you know. That's for sure! Someone I don't know. Oh, that one. That's Frederic, our brother... ...who hunts tigers in Africa. How long has he been gone? Quite long enough. With tigers, you don't do what you want. Hurricane! Really! Constance, don't you think... ...that we could let Darling in on... ...our little secrets? Of course! She's almost a Bretillac. And Mr de Bresset already knows. Yeah! So... this is it... Flying Fortress! Pou, go play in your room! Who can I attack with my planes? Do as you're told! I'll take my artillery. Off you go! Well, if it's to tell the story of Uncle Frederic... ...I've known it for a long time. He's unbearable! Well then... Frederic doesn't hunt tigers in Africa. - No. - No. He owns a bistro in Toulon, with his wife... A nobody who he married in spite of us. A restaurant waitress. - Fixed price. - Oh! A fixed price restaurant... it doesn't help. In short, we have of course stopped seeing him. And to explain his absence… You invented tigers. My child, certain truths are left unsaid. - Of course. - Isn't it so? One day you'll be able to say he was devoured. Tigers are useful... they leave no trace. Good evening, family. Good evening darling. Uncle Etienne will be working late. -Good evening darling. Sit down. Did you work well? He's starting to like the oil mill. I'm crazy. Our little Darling has also been working... For you, Bruno. Do we tell him? They're not quite finished. Come and see. - Like them? - What are they? Embroidered slippers. The dream of my life. Magnificent! I'm very touched. You're going too far. Madame, can I now ask Bruno for his opinion? Certainly, my child, What do you prefer, dearest, royal purple or canary yellow? For what? - Our bedroom. - I'll leave it to you. They get on so well together. At last. We'll make it yellow. But not solid colour. With flowers or birds. Little chicks! Why not elephants into the bargain? Yes, you're right, no birds. We already have one. We have a bird? Yes, your aunt offered us one. And the big clock you love so much... ...will wake us with a "cuckoo" every morning of our life. This is more than comedy... it's a circus. I'm overwhelmed, thank you! Yes, my boy, Darling told me that would make you happy. Would you help me with an inventory? How can I be of use? Come. Edouard will help you. How? Yes. What? Oh, yes, Sure. Therese... See if Antoinette has finished. Alright, Constance. In other words... "Leave them to themselves." "They've so much to say to each other." Correct... I've a lot to talk about. I trust you realise that you irritate me. You seem to enjoy playing the role of a little twit engaged to an idiot. I've had enough of it. Very well... What do you want to play? We've a good half hour to kill. I don't want to play. No more playing, Darling. We can also be silent. I don't want to be silent, either. Since we're being spared the loneliness of lovers... ...we could talk about love, couldn't we? Talk about whose love? Our love. That's ridiculous. Does the prospect scare you? It's not comedy without an audience. Then try to be sincere. That's not in our agreement. You've never felt like forgetting that famous agreement? Tell me. I do, very often. And you know... You've guessed for a long time. Guess what? That I love you. It had to happen. And I'm glad that it happened. I love you, Darling. My darling. Our love, if you want it, will never be a lie again. Do you want it? Well? Is it really so hard to say yes? Maybe I don't want to. Then I know you would've already said no. You're so stupid! We were going to get married quietly... ...and get divorced nicely. And you ruin it all with your love stories. Numskull! So what'll we do now? Love one another. You complicate everything. Love one another, be happy... it's not complicated. My Darling... you will see. You could ask my opinion. Afterwards. 1, 2 and 3. So... the total? Three hundred and forty-three thousand seven hundred and eighty-two francs, 50 cents. 52 cents. With the pennies we build big houses. Especially little ones. For the month of November? I have 7 different answers. Why 7? I checked the bill 7 times and I have 7 totals. Edouard... December? Sorry, I still haven't finished with spring. Constance, I'm crushed by the weight of these figures, and my shame. Alright, my dear, your punishment is lifted. Among my 7 solutions, one may be exact. I'm a strong believer in chance. Good evening young man. I knew you were all right. What's with the red mark? Pretty little star... before falling asleep, I'm waiting for you to reveal my whole future to me. No need to ask the stars for that. My participation in your affairs... ..allows you to appeal to my light. No, Maxim, this question is beyond you. It's not about worldly elegance, or protocol. So it's about love. So the inevitable hasn't been avoided. You love Bruno... and Bruno loves you. Yes. A few days ago, we kissed... And I ran away to play my character. Today it was he who kissed me and I ran anyway. It wasn't to play, Maxim. I know. That's why I came. How do you see the end of our little enterprise? I see a wedding, as planned. And then? That's all. A marriage, without divorce, without payment or percentage. To be wedded to the provincial upper-middle-class. A Darling of Montmartre... ...snugly settled in a lie. A lie? Not necessarily. When did I lie? Yesterday? Today? I've shown 2 faces... That of a darling who's lived to excess... ...and that of the one who's come to understand the meaning of the word... Darling. Which is my real face? I no longer know myself. I know, though. Who doesn't have 2 faces, Darling? Take a good look at that cynical old man, next to you. He's the other face of one of the least bad guys you'll find. That one tells you to get out of this. No. What is it you really want? That I have fun demolishing everything? No. That I shout my sordid past to the Bretillac family? No! I want to be happy. Bruno loves me and I love him. I'm staying! Until the Bretillacs are forced to invent a new tiger-hunt. I run that risk. If they throw me out the door, Bruno will leave with me. Oh yeah! And you'll open a 2nd bistro in Toulon. Frederic and Bruno will share common memories. How do you know they won't forgive me? I love Bruno and I learned to love them. I'm sincere about that. Then leave. By deciding to stay... ...you'd be starting what I would describe... ...as a swindle. I know what I'm talking about. Bruno will be my husband. And your accomplice. Stop it! I'll have the right to live like any Bretillac! I don't care about their traditions, their prejudices... or your advice! Do I make myself clear? I'm staying! No. Say, where is your present? We don't put a castle on a table, my boy. - You gave them a castle? - Yes. Sort of. Go join the others, my boy. Where's your castle? In Spain, my boy. In Spain. Come on. Charming! But who had the strange idea of a cactus, as a wedding present? It's surely not a gift, but a cry from the heart. Excuse me. Be cheerful! I'm not sad. You should be! Why? Bruno and Darling will be happy. You idiot! Ah! Dear Mr de Bresset. Allow me to congratulate you. The couple are so well-matched! They are, aren't they, dear Madame? I really admired your cactus. What refined consideration! You look lovely, Miss. Thanks. I do what I can. Etienne feared you wouldn't be able to come. How could we miss the marriage the whole county is talking about?! It is a real attraction. - You coming? - Yes, Mum. Where is our tree? Excuse me, I am late. You have every reason, my dear girl. I only represent the patience of Bruno. Adorable! - Are you nearly finished? - Finished, Madame. - It was a success, eh? - Absolutely. It's our most beautiful wedding in a long time. Come Irene. - We're going down? - In a minute. Therese, in a minute, ask Edward and Etienne to come up. Yes, Constance. In 10 minutes, you'll be with our friends... ...who'll be your friends tomorrow. In an hour you’ll be Mrs Bruno Bretillac. One more Bretillac... A Bretillac like the others. Most of all, like you, I hope, Madame. When the procession forms, the children will walk in front. Are we leaving soon? We're only waiting for the bride. The wedding's at 11 at the town hall and at noon at the church. Is it at the church or the town hall, where people die laughing? What do you mean? Mrs Chomelette said the wedding will make her die laughing. She's right, we're going to be gay and laugh all day. But no one will die. Alas! Five past eleven. The Mayor will scold us. Come in. Oh, there you are! Come. Darling, it is a mere formality. A family tradition. You are going to be crowned Bretillac. Close your eyes. There you are. And now, open your eyes. My God it's beautiful! It's yours, my child. Mine? But... But Madamee. Oh, it's not a gift. It's your badge of rank. "The Order of Bretillac". All the women who came into the family, have worn this. Constance was the last one. And I'm passing it on to you. From this minute on, our house becomes yours. May God allow us to still be here... ...the day you pass it to the one who follows you. Kiss us, child. No. No I can't. I can't anymore. Darling...! - What are you saying? - Darling... Oh, enough! No more Darling! Don't call me Darling... not you! Bruno told me to ask you if the marriage was for today? - Go away! - No answer? Go away or I'll slap you! Do you want to explain yourself? I'll tell you the truth, Madamee. It will be painful. Etienne, shut the door. Obviously! I'm listening. So? - I got a slap. - A slap? Dad was furious. I ran away. Fancy beating me on a wedding day! They are ready? Darling already had the necklace on. So everything's fine. I told you everything. I had to tell you everything because I love Bruno... ...and I've come to love you as well. If you forgive me, I'll honour that forgiveness. Otherwise, I'll leave. It's for you to make a decision. We'll make it. It's made! And your phony uncle will hear from me! - The lout! - Etienne! Well? There's to be no scandal! The scandal is the fraud of de Bresset who made possible. The scam that this girl was perpetrating. - Agree? - Yes. - So? Leave Mr de Bresset to me... ...at least while he's here in our house. Time's running out. You and Bruno have tricked us. And now you confess. You'll understand if this outburst of confession can't sway us. Yes Madame. That would be too easy. Put the necklace back on. Back on? But then… For the time being. That of the marriage. The… How...? But what is…? But how...? What are you saying?! 100 people are here to see this wedding... - They'll see it. - Are you mad?! They'll see it! It will not be said that a bar-girl... ...and a carnival huckster, had ridiculed us. You acted out a play for us... You'll now do it for the others. - That's not possible. - Why not? Does Bruno know about your confession? Nothing at all. He doesn't even know that I love him. Perfect. You'll marry him. - And? - Divorce? No. The marriage will be annulled. I'll take care of the pretext. Nobody will know anything. No objection? Good. Take the necklace back. It's not possible. - No, you don't have the right. - You've given us the right. I could have said nothing... Continue an easy lie. Bruno wanted that. I didn't want it, and told you the truth. Too late. No one's all-good or all-bad. What I've said will be done. You'll leave tonight. Oh… Listen Constance... At least wait a few days. No need to be cruel. I don't like having to do it, but what I said will be done! The lie is not going to be installed in our lives. Maybe we could forgive... For once. Once, and it starts again. Darling will not be an exception. It'd open the way to others. I don't want it. She must go. She'll leave. And Bruno? His love? He has the right to live! We live very well without love. Otherwise, we wouldn't be here. So nothing matters to you? Nothing but the task that falls to me. Oh yes! Go all the way and go straight there. It doesn't matter who it hurts, so long as you save face. You talk about courage and tradition! You are only pride and hypocrisy! Watch your tongue! The opinion of others matters to you, in place of thought and religion. It's about self-esteem! - Exactly! - Not true! All that matters is the impression you make. You're all shaking lest my voice be heard. Oh, you are strong! So strong! The Bretillacs are really something! Don't cross any Bretillac who wants something! Especially not you! No, I'm not on your level. But tonight, once you're alone facing yourselves... ...you will realise... ...that there are girls like me... ...who are better than you! I doubt that. And it wouldn't change anything! I know that! So you'll get your scandal! And get it now! I'll go out and yell at those people, what I am and what you are! If they're capable of judging, they'll judge! Well…? So... We… That's to say… Yes. What's going on, Darling? You're crying? What's going on? Nothing, nothing, Bruno. I'm just emotional. Yes, emotional. But we have to decide. They're getting impatient. I have decided. It's alright, I'll do it. Therese, have the cars brought forward. Yes, Constance. Edward, your eyes are all red. One can also cry with joy. After all, it's my son who's marrying. That's right. Etienne, smile! And if she talks to Bruno? She won't talk. She'll be a good girl. United by the sacred bonds of marriage before God and his Church... ...you will have to follow that road, often dangerous and difficult... ...which leads to the great happiness that Jesus promised to the righteous. You will make it through each other and for each other... ..in the wonderful traditions of the large family... ...to which you now belong. Come my children... ...and be happy. Get ready to freeze... now! Thank you! Beautiful wedding, Constance. It was. You're pleased with yourself, I hope. 2 minutes please! Here I am now, in the family. Like a burglar. - What? - You heard very well. Did Darling speak to you? Everybody... freeze! So, why this marriage? For the others. Thank you! Darling... finally! I was looking for you. You seem to have lost everything... even the sense of the ridiculous. I'm used to being able to put that to one side. It's done. So leave. Your job is done... mine begins. Of our 2 jobs, as you put it... ...which of them is less honourable? Are you sure you're right? Yes. Your famous principles. Famous or not, they're principles. We all have these principles, and they're always respected. All? Really? Always? You have a short memory. Have you forgotten the girl who came to join a young man... ...in his small apartment 30 years ago? You and me? Doesn't matter. Nobody knew. Yes, it's all here, isn't it. If there's nothing else to hope for, everything is here. And there's nothing else to look forward to... ...either for Bruno or for Darling. So much remorse for your old age! I will have fulfilled my task to keep this family clean and intact. Goodbye, Maxim. Goodbye, Constance. Goodbye, Helene. We wouldn't be back for a year. Too bad for everything else! I want to spend long weeks alone with you. I suggest America. Let's talk about serious things. Serious things? Face reality... You're flying to the moon. Shouldn't we come back to Earth? Not at all. And since when does a girl say "vous" to her husband? I forgive you. - Don't mention it. - Darling… The performance is over, my dear. Curtain! The performance is over... ...and our life begins. Oh no! Stop playing "Romeo and Juliet". You have the soul of a playboy. How? But... I don't play. What do you mean? Come on, if you take yourself so seriously, we'll never end this. What? "Take myself seriously"? You know very well that I love you. Darling... remember the other night... I kissed you. What night? What! Just 3 days ago. Oh... yes! Forgive me... it had slipped my mind. So what? So, I love you, that's what! You know that very well. I love you. That's news! Funny idea. What's up with you? Let's see... you've kissed me, as well. Don't get angry. Tell me... what does it prove? If we can't joke anymore...! You were crying! What for? What for? Young ladies like to cry on their wedding day. And I cry easily... Like at the police station. You lied to me like you do to others, making me believe that... Don't give me that! You were in on it. But you take candles for stars. You're... you're... Oh, I hate you! - Oh, we should get along. - Just go away. Gladly. But first... this first. I never take jewellery. And you have to leave something for the others. And… That. - What? - The cheque. You know... The sordid little side of our love. You won't let yourself have regrets? I can't afford to. The whole amount? Oh no. As we agreed... half now, the rest on divorce. There you are. We could still part as good friends. Do you want to? So… Goodbye Bruno. Goodbye, Darling. For your charity and regional recovery. Darling. I didn't want you to leave like that, all alone. I wanted to see you again to tell you that... - To tell you… - Everything's been said. To say that I like you. So there! But it was impossible... because… Well, after all, you understand. Kiss me. And now go. Go quickly. I would have liked to have your courage. Take care of him... He's unhappy... Don't let him be unhappy for too long. So... it's over. My poor Darling. Oh, it's nothing. Smoke and dust. You'll forget. We always forget. Never! Who knows what tomorrow brings? "Nothing is impossible when we want it." Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
