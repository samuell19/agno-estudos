Dad! - I'm trying to lose that nutcase. Shit! What are you doing, you psycho? Move, dammit! You Taliban bastard. Fucking hell! Shit! Shit! Dear Alice APPOINTMENT AT SOCIAL SERVICES Maya, don't play with your food. - But I want to. Hey, you. Stop playing around and start eating. But it's cool. Mummy's on TV. - Mum, you're on TV. Quiet, Gloria. I haven't finished preparing her surprise. His lawyer Karin Said refuses to comment. This is Karin. - Morning. Morning. - Did you watch the news? I can't deal with it now. - Arrange a press conference. When? - 11 o'clock. Get him at the station. He needs to be clean, shaved and remorseful. I doubt he has any remorse. He's an actor. He can fake it. - Alright. See you. Karin? Congratulations. I ... We're looking forward to having you on board as a partner. Thanks, Richard. I'm really honoured. Talk to you later. - Bye. Come on. Congratulations. - It looks wonderful. It's so nice. - Hug. You must have been up really early. Have you had breakfast? Who called? - Richard. Please, Moses. - Can't he wait until you get there? Is this how it'll be? - Only in the beginning. He's going to call all the time. Just for now. It'll be okay. How does it feel? Are you nervous? No, just a bit stressed out. This all looks great, but I have to go to work now. You haven't touched your food. - Could you drop off the girls? It's your turn. - I know, but it's an emergency. I have a job, too, you know. - We have to be flexible. Please, sweetie, is it okay? - I said I'd do it. Is it okay, if daddy drives you? - Yes. I'll pick you up from school. Kisses. Wait a minute. Keep an eye on the food. I'll be right back. Karin. Of course I'll drive them to school. This is your big day. Thank you. - I want the best things for you. Gloria has a show and tell today. She's going to bring Gabbe. Yes. - To school? See you. This isn't an advertising agency. You're a social worker. I know, Margareta. It's only the first two. - They're probably on their way. - Tell them I'm sorry. Ask them if they can swing by this afternoon. Could you do that? - Okay. So you'll stay late? I'll take care of it then, but please come as quick as you can. Is Gabbe okay back there? He's not getting car sick, is he? What the ...? Seriously ... Hello? - Hi. Elisabeth, tell me honestly. Should I get a different hair cut? - Did someone tell you that? It was just Tomas and the guys at the office. Maybe I should fix myself up a little. Botox or liposuction. You could try the South Beach diet, like President Clinton. He hasn't been president for two decades. I just wanted to say hi and that I love you. And good luck. Will you promise to call me later? - I promise. What the fuck are you doing? How's it going? How's it going? Where shall I put it? - Right here. Right, okay. Have a nice day, honey. See you later. Hi, Moses. Have you contributed to the class fund? No, I haven't. I left my wallet at home. - Today's the last day. I haven't got any money on me. Can I give Gloria some to bring? Is that okay? - Okay. How's it going? How's it ...? Hi. Hello? POLICE Hi. I'm going to see Persson. Morning. I'm here for Petterson. Release number 4. His lawyer's here. Fill this out. Time to go. That's just great. Excuse me. Moses, I can't talk now. - It's important. My dad's ill. Again? - He's getting old. And the health care system doesn't work. I have to send some money. Can you lend me some? Of course, but things are a bit tight these days because of the house. I've already spent my next three pay checks. What do you mean? We agreed that we'd discuss every major expense. How am I supposed to pay half, when you ...? It's a big house, Moses. - I know. I wanted a smaller one. I wanted a great life for us. The house is part of that. They're going to amputate his leg. Jesus. Take it from the girls' account. - I can't do that. We have to discuss this later. Who should I make it out to? - To Lillan. Likewise. - Have I ever told you ...? Yes. Yes. - There's something sexy about you. Wait a minute. Since we're on the subject ... I thought you were getting counselling. I did, but the female therapist thought she was my soul mate. I thought alcoholics couldn't get it up. I'll drive you home. Thanks, but I can drive myself. Are you fit to drive? - Should I walk a straight line? Get help before it's too late. The press conference's at 11. Shaved and remorseful. Sexy and strict. - 11 o'clock. Please enter your social security number. Current available funds: 430 kroner and 85 øre. Select other services if needed. No ... I'm just going to get some money. Could you stay for a little while? Just for a little while? Just go then. Go! And don't try to rape me again! Police, may I help you? Yes, hello? I want to report an attempted rape. Social security number? - 300807-0504. How are you holding up right now? I'm a bit shocked. I've sent a patrol car. Can you identify the assailant? Yes. Sure. Do you need an ambulance? - What? No. Okay. Just stay where you are. Help is on its way. Very good. Thanks. Bye. I know, Margareta. I'll figure out how to solve the problem. I'm coming as soon as possible. I'm sorry. Bye. Excuse me. You have to sign in. Do I need to sign in? - Yes, please. And you don't know who I am? Bosse Krantz. I'm sorry. I'm new here. No worries. Here you go. - Thank you. See you soon. Hey ... Great article. Want to read something nice? One is a star after all. Hello. - Hi, Bosse. Have you seen this? - It's a great article. Have a seat. Would you like some coffee? This is Kamal ... Nadjim. I do stand-up as the Mad Turk. Have you seen my act? Afraid not. - And you know Annika. She's here in Tomas' place. He's busy, now he's the vice president. I spoke to him this weekend. Annika's taken over as manager of light entertainment. Okay. These are the ratings for "Money or the Monkey" I'm sorry, but they look rather bleak. Listen, Bosse, we're planning some huge changes. Shows that don't have enough viewers are costing us money. We have to reach a multi-cultural viewership. How are we going to do that? We're suggesting, - that you leave the show. The ratings are very clear. What's the fucking Turk got to do with that? No no. "Mad Turk". There's no reason to be racist. Bosse, Kamal's going to host a new version of "Money or the Monkey". He'll appeal to a new demographic. - You can't do this to me. It's been doing great for 20 years. The management assured me, that this is in accordance with your contract. Everything's gone by the book. We just needed to tell you. I consider this to be done now. You haven't been fired. Maybe there's another show. We're restructuring at the moment, so you never know. You've thought it all through. I can just rot until retirement kicks in. I'll talk to Tomas. It's no use. This comes directly from him. It comes directly from Tomas? Fuck all of you. Easy now. - You're edging me out of my job. It's my life. And I dressed up for this. - I can't do anything about it. Do you think I'm enjoying this? Do you think I wanted this? Next time it'll be you. Karolina, It's Karin. Petterson's fucked up again. It'd be great if you could help ... You've reached Karin Said's voicemail. Leave a message. It's me. Could you call me? I have a bit of a problem. Make sure there's lots of fruit and soft drinks for the journalists. I'm sorry, Bosse, but Tomas is really busy today. Is it okay? - Go right in. The trailer's going to look great. Hi. - Hi, Karin. Morning, partner. How was Petterson? - A bit tired. It's so tragic. - Some day he'll kill someone. I don't know what to say to the press. You'll think of something. Shall we go over the press conference? How are we going to spin it? - I'm thinking remorse. We'll state that he's going into rehab. And that he'll do community service for as long as it takes. Hopefully he'll keep his mouth shut. What did you need me for? That's just perfect. Thanks. Svend wants to see us about the paperwork, and then we'll have lunch. I didn't hear anything about lunch. - We eat the new partners. I get the first bite. Yes. Good luck. - Thank you. Hi. I'd like to send some money to Uganda. Alright. This way. Fill out this form. ID. Thank you. I look younger now. I don't think so. How much do you want to transfer? - 5,000 Swedish kroner. Any message? - Please write: Here's your receipt. - Thank you. Thank you. - Have a nice day. Worth 300 kroner. But for you it's free. Thank you. Just to confirm, it was a dark man? He was a negro. He looked very aggressive. And then she cried "rape". And he started running away, and I went to call the police. I see. - Have you caught him? No, we haven't. We're a bit understaffed. I think we have what we need. Thank you very much. SOCIAL SERVICES Please have a seat. He'll be here soon. This is the second time Petterson has been caught drunk driving. Us normal people would get sent to jail. What's going to happen to him? He'll do 60 hours of community service and go into rehab. How does it feel? How it feels? It feels like I need a gin & tonic right now. Could this hurt the film? - No. Håkan's a professional and he won't delay filming. Has his license been revoked? - That's the law. What do you think about that? - It's the right thing to do. I guess I have to take a limousine instead. Is there any truth to the rumours about the two of you? What rumours? That you're together. - That's enough. Is it a good rehab centre? You've reached Elisabeth and Bosse Krantz. Leave a message. Hey, it's me. - Hello? Paulina? It's Bosse. Elisabeth's not here. She went to Pelicano with a friend. I understand. Thank you. Richard, Bosse Krantz here. I need to see you. Hi, Margareta. Sorry I'm late. - Tell those people that. Good. Please follow me. How may I help you? Hello? - This is Markus at the kindergarten. Has something happened? - Maya has a fever. I can't be there until after two o'clock. How is she? That's too late. She has to go home now. I'll try to reach her dad, okay? Please come get her as soon as possible. Give her a hug from me. I'll call you back. Shit. You've reached Moses Said. Please leave a message. Hi, it's me. Please call as soon as possible. Maya's ill, - and I can't get away from work. I have this lunch thing. Could you call me or leave a message? Kisses. Are you nervous? - No, it's just that Maya's ill. And no one else can get her? Let's hope you solve this. This is a big day for all of us. I know. Where are you going? - I'm meeting Bosse Krantz. I'll meet you in the conference room. That's were we sign the papers. Bye. - Bye. Yes? - Where have you been? Maya's ill. - In what way? I can't leave work. I have an important lunch meeting. Can you please go and get her? - Karin, I ... Where are you? - At work of course. I came in late this morning. I have to work late. I know your job is as important as mine. It's just a very special day. Of course. - "Of course". Why do you say that? I know. Hey ... I'll take care of this. I might as well get Gloria then. - I love you. Thank you. Kisses. I need to run. Maya's ill, and I have to go get her. Reschedule the meetings, and I'll be back as soon as I get a babysitter. Those of you who are going to see Moses Said have to reschedule. What the fuck is this all about? - Reschedule or just leave. Fucking social worker! We can sue them. They have to compensate you. What does that matter? What do you need me for then? It's not the money. It was the way they got rid of me. Like I'm nothing. I have a standing in the business. I'm worth something. Sure. Come on. Please stay until my wife gets here. She's having lunch here. I'm sorry. I can't. I have a meeting. Go easy on the South African. - I can handle it. Alright. Speak to you soon. Check, please. Nice work at the press conference. - Thank you. Shall we sign the papers? - And then we'll go to lunch. It's just a small gesture. Dear Karin, we really appreciate your work here. And today we're making history by making you a partner. We just need you to do one thing. - Anything. Change your name. - What? We think your surname will be a problem. A technical problem. - How so? Lundén, Voss and Karlsson sounds better. There are no surprises there. Said might be a bit too exotic. Don't make a big deal out of it. Don't let this ... ... detail get in the way of becoming a partner. Would it get in the way? I understand. I need to think about this. Take all the time you need. - Don't make this hard. This is for you. We need you here. Thank you. I think I'll skip lunch. - Okay. I've submitted your application to dissolve your company. It won't be dissolved, - until all transactions pertaining to company taxes are completed. Like liquidation of assets - and compensations for investment. Everything must be entered into the ledgers and taxed, - - so the company has no value. It's not too complicated, Mr. Namazi. This can be done quickly. It's a matter of a few weeks or months. Then the confirmation of dissolution will be mailed to you. This is no problem, if you haven't got any assets. Like we say: "No assets, less trouble." Eurobank. - This is Bosse Krantz. I want to close the joint accounts I have with my wife. Sure. When would you like to do it? - Now. Draw up the papers. I'm not sure, we can make it. The bank closes at three. Bullshit. Draw up the papers! I'm on my way! Hello? Maya, tell me, if you need to throw up. I want an ice cream. - Okay. Yes? Hi, I was in here to send money through Western Exchange. That's my daughter. It's okay. I sent 5,000 and my dad says it hasn't arrived. I don't know anything about that. - There must be a way to check. Yes. - Maybe the system's down. I'm pressed for time. What is your dad's name? - It says Ibrahim Said right there. Can I see some identification? Where is the money? Have you sent money before? - Yes, without problems. What's going on? Do you have my money? You should call Western Exchange. - Okay, but give me back my money. It's already in the system. But my dad didn't get the money. Call Western Exchange. - Give me back my money. Now. You have to call them, and then come back for your money. This is insane. You're stealing my money. Please. We have to follow the rules. This is the number. Call them. Then you can get your money back. Maya, we're leaving. - What about the ice cream? I'll be back. No ice cream today. - But you promised ... I'll be back. Honey, you can have an ice cream when we get home. Excuse me. Please. My daughter's ill. This is a bike path. Look at the sign. Next time it'll get towed. Thank you very much. Get in, Maya. Buckle up. May I enter? Listen, this wasn't the way it was supposed to go. How did you imagine, it would go? Karin, this is an old company with lots of traditions. It's a huge breakthrough that the board has selected a woman. Really ... - You have to make a compromise. No. - Karin, I fought for you. You're asking me to change my name. - No, we're not. We're asking you to use your maiden name. You'll always be a Said. Karlsson is just your company name. - Why? It suits our profile better. "Our profile"? - Stop it. You know what it's about. Why are you acting so shocked? I am shocked. I thought you chose me because of my skills. Don't be stupid now. It's just for appearance's sake. It's not important. Why make it into something it's not? I'll think about it. Anything else? Excuse me? You lost a wheel. I want mum. - Quiet, Maya. There's my dad. - See you. Fuck. What are you doing? I told you to look both ways before you cross. Sorry, dad. - Sorry? Never do that again. Dad ... - I don't have time for this. Look where you're going. This is a school area. For fuck's sake. Stop jaywalking, man. Why's Maya crying? - I'm sick. We forgot Gabbe at school. How could you forget him? - I tried to tell you. You just yelled at me. We'll get him later. I have to go to the bank. What's he doing? I don't believe it. Wait here, girls. I was backing up. You took my parking spot. No, I didn't see you. I was here first. Of course you saw me. Step aside. I have to get to the bank. Find another parking spot. I'm also going to the bank. Why should I give you the spot? Are there signs telling me to do that? Move your fucking car or I'll do it. Don't touch me! - I'm just asking to move your car. He was here first. - See? I have a witness. What? Who are you? I was here first. Leave him alone. It's his spot. Guys like you always create trouble. What do you mean by that? - Dad. I told you to wait in the car. You're aggressive. - Shut up and move your car! Police! Do you think you can do whatever you like? You bastard! - He's very hostile. I haven't done anything. - Take it easy! You can't do this. He's irrational and hostile. - Bullshit. What happened? I was on my way to the bank and then he said it was his spot. Easy now! Three minutes to three. Easy! I'm locking up. - He's coming now. We're closed. The bank is closed. Hello? - Don't do that. But I'm here now. - The bank opens at ten tomorrow. Hello? - Karin? He resisted arrest. The suspect hit Bosse Krantz. Will he press charges? - No, but he was really angry. He talked about going to the media. And witnesses say the black guy threatened to kill Bosse Krantz. Are you pressing charges? - No. Then release him. - One more thing. Hi, Elsa. I'll ask you again, where were you between 9 and 10 this morning? I told you. I was at home. What does that have to do with parking? You were at home? - Yes, I was. Are you sure? - Do you think I can't remember? You're suspected of attempted rape. - What? What are you saying? - Sit down. What are you saying? - Get back in that chair. Are you insane? What is this all about? What's going on in here? - He won't sit down. Sit down. Now. You don't have to say anything. - But I know her. That's Karin. We used to be neighbours. She recently moved away along with her lovely family. What's going on? How's the new house? It's great, but it's a lot of work. I want to show you something. Isn't that Moses? How are things with you two? And the girls? Fine. The police claim that a black man sexually molested you. Is that true? No, I never said that. They're saying Moses did it. No. No ... Get him out of interrogation. Thank you, Elsa. Sign this. "Resisting arrest." You forgot "attempted rape". Just sign it. It doesn't say so. Thank you. You're very welcome. Hi. - Hi. Have you waited a long time? - Hi, honey. It's so good to see you. Let's get out of here. Is daddy going to be on TV? - No, he's not. Aren't you going to say something? What am I supposed to say? Anything. It wasn't my fault. I hope you understand that. That you threatened to kill a TV presenter or resisted arrest? Did they say I threatened to kill him? Did they say that? He came at us in his car. The children were in the back. Okay. - No, it's not okay. The police are looking for a black man and then they think: "He's probably the one who raped that old bird." Stop shouting. - I'll shout as much as I want. Stop shouting yourself. I'm allowed to shout! Don't you understand? - I get it, Moses. Karin, my dad's sick and I'm trying to help him, but I can't. I spent all day trying to help him! - Calm down. Watch the road! Shut up, Moses. What are you doing? Are you okay, girls? - Yes. I need to talk to you about something else. Let's get out of the car. What do you want to talk about? - I'm not your enemy. So talk. - Stop being angry with me. I'm angry with them. I know this is really bad timing, but ... Richard and Svend want me to drop Said. They don't think it suits Lundén and Voss. Why don't you do that, Karin? It doesn't matter anyway. Said doesn't suit the EU, UN or USA either. What are you talking about? - My civil rights. Said is my name, Karin. I'm proud of it. What you're doing is wrong. Stop thinking about right and wrong. Concentrate on the important stuff. What's important? Having a big, fancy house? To impress Richard and the other idiots at work? Did you agree to it? Did you agree to change your name? Answer me. - What if I have? Then you can go to hell along with all the other fucking racists. No. Don't laugh. I've tried to be a good little citizen. Always did the right thing. They want to brand me as a terrorist and take away my name. I won't stand for it! - Everyone should feel sorry for you. From now on I only trust myself. I'm doing something about this. Starting with that fat fuck. - Pull yourself together! We're just going to get daddy's car. Come on. What about mum? - She's taking daddy's car. Hi. I'm Elisabeth Krantz, Bosse's wife. I'm here to see Bosse. - Alright. From "Money or the Monkey". I'm sorry, but he's not on that show anymore. There must be some mistake. Check again. I'm sorry. I can't find him anywhere. Are you sure? - I'm sorry. Thank you very much. Why is this happening to me? I don't fucking ... I don't fucking know what I've done, to deserve this damn ... What have I done to deserve this damn mess? Wait here. I'll be right back. That bastard. Damn bastard. Following me home, eh? I'll show you, you bastard. I forgot one thing ... I'll get you, you bastard. What are you doing, crazy idiot? Damn! Fuck! - Drive! Leave me alone! Don't even fucking think about me! I can't get this fucking thing to start! You Taliban bastard! MONEY REROUTED TERRORIST LIST TWO WEEKS GOLD What the hell? Get out of the way! Bosse, where are you? - I saw you two together. Who? - Don't lie to me. Fucking hell! I saw you at the restaurant. Shit! That was Erik, your daughter's fiancé. I wanted you to meet him. What? - Yes, you idiot. What the fuck? - Shit! Forgive me, Elisabeth. I thought you'd left me. I want to send some money to Uganda. How much? - 10,000. Fill in the name of the recipient. And your name? - Karin Karlsson. It's gasoline! Daddy has to help. Stay here. Dad, don't go! - Come back! Help. - Are you stuck? Come back! Dad! Come back! - Dad. Come back, dad! She's suing us. LETTER OF RESIGNATION KARIN SAID Your driver's license. - Thank you. Who's this? - It's my wife. Hi, honey. You can take the children and leave the area. We'll contact you at home. - Thank you.
